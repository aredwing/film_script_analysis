I like to play with the audience's feelings, like you've seen in my portfolio what I'm creating for you is the same. The entire space is covered with black-and-white graphics. But it has movement, a mirage of motion graphics, combined with the lightning that gives accent to the piece. Before the event I'll install some fiber optics that will complement the lightning. I guarantee it'll be like a head trip into a labyrinth. I want to surprise the guests at the opening. Do whatever you like to make sure they'll have goose bumps when they see it. You bet. What's that? Another surprise for me? Rats, maybe. It must be a giant rat. There's nothing. Shit... what the fuck is that? - Boss! - Hey / Boss! Damn it! Whats the matter? You look troubled. I've had a bad dream. Dreams are just dreams. I'm worried about my son. I thought you talked on the phone all the time. Because of last night's dream, my mind is on edge. I'm afraid he's suffering from bad luck. I'll tell him to go make merit. What do you think your emminence? Do it if it'll ease your worried mind. There's nothing wrong with making merit. Nat. Nat. Nat. Where are you? Don't play games like this. I don't like it. You guys are nuts! I'm not in the mood for this. Sorry, we're just joking. Let's go to the party. Come, we're all dressed up. I want to go home to sleep. No time for you nonsense. Please come with us to the party. I'll slap you ghosts all the way back to your graves. Let's take some pictures. Cheers! Nat! Are you free this weekend? - The gang's going to Chiang Mai. - Why? We have a long holiday. You think we're going there to make merit? - Cool man. - Are you coming? I need to pee. Where's the toilet? Over there. Hey, what's up Poon? You said you couldn't come! Joop, you bitch, I didn't know it was the same party. Wait for me here, I've got to use the toilet. - Ok. - You scared me! So you've been partying a lot lately? I didn't want to come tonight. Nat dragged me here. So you two are getting serious? Why? It's been longer than usual. Is one year unusually long? Usually you ditch men like old underwear. You want me to count them for you? I think you should at least tell him. What's the point? By the way, I've got the number. The clinic is around Ta Din Daeng. Are you sure you want to do this? Yes. Think about it carefully. See you outside. Boy, this is the ladies' room. Hey. Damn. I have to stop at the office to get my camera. Nat.. Why don't we drop in to see your mom in Uthai? It's on the way, isn't it? Why? I just want to get to know her. I'm not kidding. It's on the way to Chiang Mai anyway. My mom is a bore, it'll be a waste of time. Come on, just to say hi. For Mom, Happy New Year 2008 I sensed that you'd be coming, so I got up early to cook these steamed fish cakes. How's your work going? It's all right. What's your salary now? Enough. How did you meet Nat? Update me. Well, I'm sort of friend of a friend of a friend. What year were you born? Mom. The Year of the Rooster. Yes, ma'am. So you're almost one year older than Nat. Nat. Last week I called you... What was it about? I want you to go make merit at 9 temples to ward off misfortune. What did you dream about this time? I'm not joking. I'm worried that we're in for some bad luck. What did you dream about? They say we shouldn't discuss our dreams while we're eating. Please tell Nat that I'll have to deliver a Buddha statue to another district. I'll come back before noon. Don't leave just yet. I'll take him to pray at the temple. Yes, ma'am. Look at that! A supermodel! Well, have you lost weight? You look snazzy. Of course. I have to be snazzy. Guys like me have to stay in trend. See these skinny jeans. Tough when I take a shit. But seriously man, if I don't deck myself out like this, my girlfriend will dump me. Well, if it's such a hassle, I'd dump her first. Jerk, if I only looked like you. What are you doing? It's ok, you don't have to pay. It's all right. See you later. Whoa! I thought it was 100. It's 500! For my new hair dye. I'll show you something. This one shows Lord Buddha preaching to his disciples. This one, he was giving a sermon to his relatives at Kabilpas. And those are scenes from heaven and hell. These creatures are so weird. Look, there's horses as well. Aha, so this is what you want to show me. When did you paint it? In junior high. Do you come her often? No... but my mom comes every day. If she has 10 baht, she'll donate 20. When the temple wants to build something, she's all in. The villagers nicknamed the temple 'Nitayaram' after my mom's. This morning you should've waited to see your mother. All right. Wait, let me go and see my fortune, just for fun. Go on. Leave them be. Hey, "Novice"! This is a Forgiving Area, don't you remember? The bird is preying on the worm. I was doing a good deed by saving the little thing. It's the cycle karma between the bird and the worm. You have nothing to do with it. You were interfering with the cycle. Enough... I'm not in the mood for a sermon. The last time we met I was still a novice monk. We haven't seen each other in 10 years. I thought you'd left this place and found yourself a girl. Are you going on a trip or something? I'm going up North, to Nan province. A holiday? No, a pilgrimage. First I'll pay a visit to my master in Nan, then I'll go on a pilgrimage to Bo Kleu village. I see. You need a ride? I'd be happy to go with you. Just drop me off in Nan. I'll find my way to Bo Kleu from there. I believe it won't take too much time away from your trip. Poon, this is Monk Sujitto. Monk, this is my girlfriend, Poon. Shall we? Do you have to pack? This is all I've got. Then let's go. You've asked the monk to come with us? I was joking. Didn't know he would be so cheap. Damn. Let's go and pay respect to the principle Buddha first. So our journey will be blessed. We've done it. You go on. What was that? Paying respect to the Buddha. How convenient, so we've got one temple. Only 8 more to visit along the way. Is he the same monk as in the photo at home? Do you have barbecue? Why do you have to go on a pilgrimage? Aren't you scared? I heard that pilgrims have to sleep over in the cemetery. We do that to purge fear from our mind. And why do you have to go to Bo Kleu? Can't you go just camping in a cemetery in Uthai? I don't desire to feel attached to one place. Precisely. If you don't want to feel attached, anywhere is good enough. If you refuse to stay at the same place, It's just another form of attachment, isn't it? That's a good question. Do I have to answer you? You've become very articulate. Let's stop at a service station. We've just gone past two. Stop at the next one. I need to pee. I'm not sure if there's one coming up. So, can you pee on the roadside? Will you come and pray to the Buddha? Be my guest. Hey! Shoo! Shoo! That looks fun. - Wanna try it? - No. Poon, let's go. We're running late. Are you sure you're not going to pray to the Buddha? Come on, pay respect, will you? See, we've got 2 temples now. It's like a rally, collection points. So we're going to stop and pee at every temple? They must've been on their way to the temple. JOOP When I was a child I wanted to go swimming like the other children. Remember when you took me out on a boat and we almost drowned? MOM Yeah. That was a long time ago. You stink of tobacco. Who was it on the phone? Tang, she told me to hand in a story. Now we've got 3 temples. Cheater. Look, a temple! Our fourth! - Let me do it! - No! Hey. You cheated again! Shit! That's the bull's eye! Asshole, how's that? Nat, don't follow them. Nat. Don't do it! Nat. Don't do it! Die and burn in hell all of you! - Three thousand? - 3pm. - Tomorrow? - Of course tomorrow. You think it can be done today? I can't wait that long. I'm a mechanic, not a Santa Claus. What if we push on to Phitsanulok? At 40km/h the windshield's gonna come off. So? You think you have a choice? OK... 3pm tomorrow... Don't be late. I'd have told you if I'd be late. We'll have to find a hotel. Looks like it. And the monk? I can spend the night at one of the temples around here. Two left turns and a right. Straight on for 200 meters and you'll see a temple. It's too far to walk. Drive the monk there first, then come back and leave the car here. This sucks. This sucks. I'll pick you up tomorrow after the car is ready. Won't you come down to pray to the Buddha? It could be your fifth temple. - What a shot... straight in. - You never lose your touch. - Oh ho... - In again... If I missed... Sweet! Gonna get cleaned out for sure! My turn. Which ball are you aiming for? A piece of cake. Put it back on the table. I let the senior citizens have a good time winning. One more beer please. Coming right up. Your girlfriend is pretty. Would you like to be in my shoes? Young love. How long have you been seeing each other? - A year. - Yeah. Do you think a year is a long time? - No. - Yes. If any man can stick with me for three days, they'll close the village and throw a carnival. I'm going out for a cigarrette. Can you get that for me? Where are you going next? Chiang Mai. To see some friends. A shot of tequila please. This girl is wild. What's the hurry? Ok, cheers! ...cheers Cheers! Pretty strong huh? Please take a seat. Cherry, take care of that table. You know, sometimes I want to play the floozy who picks up men instead of just waiting. But I'm a nice and shy lady. Would you need a trainer? She's a pro... the kind you only need small quantities of. A predator like me doesn't have to go hunting. I just wait and some man will take the bate. Easy, you guys. Nat! Nat! Nat! Nat! Nat! Poon, are you alright? - How are you? - Do you hear me? - Can you get up? - Slowly. Was there a blackout? Just briefly. But then you fell hard on your back. Why are you carrying me up the stairs? The lift is right there. I wouldn't get to feel you up if we'd taken the lift. I'll go take a shower. Do you love me? Are you ok? Please leave you message... Are you pregnant? I'll stick my foot in your face! We'd like to invite your Reverence to preside over Pued's funeral. His relative want to have the rite performed at the house. Not at the temple. The local monks are busy with two other functions. I hope there's a monk to go to the funeral. Monk, we're leaving. It shouldn't take longer than an hour. You can go inside with me or come pick me up later. The stone-thrower! No, Nat! Asshole! Why are you coming after me? Prick, don't run. Where's the rest of your gang? If you dare, come and get me. Asshole! Go to hell! - Take him. - What happened? - Get an antiseptic. - Looks like an axe wound. Nat! - How did he fall? - Nat! Make room please. What happened?! Nat, what happened? Here it is. Nat, whet happened?! Do you have something to wipe the blood? When did you find him? A while ago. Nat, what happened last night? I ask you what happened to you! Are you deaf? You're always like this! You never opened up to me. You never told me what's on your mind. Never. - Not even once? - Never. You think by shutting up all your troubles will go away. You always keep everything to yourself. Haven't you said enough? What's the point of having me? Please don't die! Please don't die! Please don't die! Please don't die! - Please don't die! - I'll take it. Nat. We must find some help. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Please don't die! Anybody here? We need help. Anybody here? We need some help. Is there a vetinarian around here? It's too late. Nothing can be done, there would only be more suffering. Which temple? Hua Kuang temple. It's next to a museum in Nan. Going for a smoke? No, I want to pray. Why don't you take Poon inside? Lady, after finishing your prayers, perform a libation and consign merit to the souls from your past lives. Are you sure? Today the builders are coming from town to help us repair the prayer hall. Daeng can be his apprentice. Yes... Don't run away from the temple again. It's best for you to stay close to holy people. - Mom! - Didn't I tell you? Brat! - Mom! /- Didn't I tell you not to mess with my business?! I'm hurt! Mom! You never listened! Poon. Poon, whats wrong? - Poon, what's wrong? - Get out! What's wrong? Poon. Poon. I saw something. Poon! What's wrong? What's happening to me? I saw a ghost, really. And I had this horrible hallucination. What do I have to do? Have you ever seen a bloodhound? It'll pursue its prey to the end. No matter how far you run, no matter how long you run the bloodhound will always find you. Karma is that bloodhound. Nonsense. What did I do? What did I do to other beings? Because I killed that calf? Karma is beyond our understanding. It's beyond our capacity to comprehend. How it works is beyond rational thought. This is a load of crap. What did you see? Tell me! What's wrong with me? Poon, reach into your back pocket and see what you have in there. It's the fortune slip you got from the temple in Uthai Thani. Remember what it says? By the way... Nat has asked me to ride with him. But it's my intention to come along. It's no coincidence that the three of us are on this journey. So what now? What was that I saw? The answer lies ahead of us. We have to continue the journey, to Bo Kleu. That's enough. Why? Poon! Why do we have to go there? What's going on there? Why do I have to... Poon! Hey! Poon. Please. Calm down Poon. Fine, just go! Son, you're in Chiang Mai, right? Have you been to make merit yet? Not yet... I'm still in Nan. Where? In Nan province. What are you doing there? I'm taking Monk Sukchito there. Hello... mom? So why's he going there? He's on a pilgrammage to Wat Bo Kleu. So where are you now exactly? - Hello? Hello? - I'm in... Nat? Nat? The number you are trying to reach cannot be connected right now. We have to stop a passing car and ask them to pull us up. Don't stand in the middle of the road! Wait here. Poon! Nat! Help! Poon! Poon! Nat! Nat! Help me! Nat! Mom! Mom, let me go! - Nat! - Mom! Let me go... Why are you doing this to me?! I hate you. I want him dead! Mom! Freak, I want you dead! Mom, let me go! Mom! Bastard. You killed him. I'll kill you, freak! Mom! Mom! You killed him!. Mom, let me go! I'm sorry mom. Mom! Mom! Poon! Poon! Poon! Did you really see... ...your past life? Poon, I know sometimes it's impossible to make people believe our story. But there's always someone who's ready to believe you. Poon. Poon. I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant and I wanted to have an abortion. I was... I was going to do what that woman once did to me. I was going to kill my baby. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Because you and I are alike. If I had told you, you'd have gone along with what I wanted to do. You have no idea what a monster I've been. Forget it. The past is past. Let's go and pray to the Buddha. People belive that in this wat you can attain inner peace. As long as you don't think bad about anything you'll be freed from the shackle of desires. It's the best moment to pray and to make merit. You must have faith in benevolance. Thank you. It's time to say farewell. I have to prepare myself. For your pilgrimage? Where're you going? Behind the temple. If you'd excuse me. Wait. Finally, we can really pray to God. Which number is this temple? It was here. It happened here. Because of me, that man fell from the roof. Here... Then mom... dragged... She dragged me over there. Over there. I want to go inside. It's raining. Let's go. I was chained to a post here. And... And my mom killed herself by jumping into a well. Outside this door. Why isn't there a well here? Ungrateful brat! Mom. Mom. Demon! Are you taking my son away? - Demon! Give me back my son! - Mom! Calm down. I'm here. Mom! Give me back my son! Mom, that's my girlfriend! Mom. My son. No! It's not him! Give me my son! You can't take him away! Give me my son! Don't hurt him! Give me back my son! Please stop. Mother. Son, you know? It's a boy. I hate you, mom! I hate you, mom! I want him dead! I hate you, mom! I want him dead! The dream that you had means karma is coming to make you pay. You have to hide what you love the most. Hide it from the claws of karma. You have to cheat it. You have to cheat it. You have to cheat it. I had to do it. I had to do it. Karma was coming to get you. Mother, do you really think you could cheat karma? You didn't realize that you've created a new cycle. You dragged innocent people into this. They're now part of our karma. What're you talking about? You can't hurt my son. Come back with me. I won't make any more mistakes. I won't. Mother, you must stop. Please go. Leave me alone. No, I won't let you die. Mother, you attach yourself too much to the force of karma. You know very well if you hope for something too much... it can make you suffer. We suffer because we can't let go. Is this why when the boat capsized and I almost drowned, you didn't try to help me? I knew you'd be all right. I was the one who taught you to swim, remember? What's this? A present. For you, mom.
