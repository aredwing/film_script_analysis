Yeah, I want to get it on tape so that I can hold you to it. Please, you don't keep those. That is a fantastic attitude you have right there. We're going to this time. Yeah? All right, fine. I solemnly swear on this New Year's resolution to go to the gym and get in shape. Oh, hell, yeah. How about you, ladybug? What's your New Year's resolution? What's that? It's like a vow or a promise that you make to be a better person. Yeah, or always eat your spinach. - Yuck. - Okay, I got one for you. How about you tell your mommy that you love her at least once a day? - Okay. - You can start right now. - I love you, Mom. - How about you, Fishbone? What's your resolution? - Your turn. - My resolution. To make a documentary about this family so that I can show the whole world what a lucky guy I am. - You are a lucky guy. - That's right. And I thank God every day. If only you believed in God. Yeah, that'd probably help a little bit. Oh, crap. You know what? I didn't put change in that meter. We're gonna get a ticket. - Dad, can you help me? - What's up? - Here, I got it. - You sure? - Yup. - Thanks, babe. So, Beverly, your psychic powers, when did you first discover them? Well, everyone's born with them, you know. But most folks don't know how to develop them. And your predictions, how many of them you think have come true? Well, all of them. Have you ever felt like you were preying on someone's superstitions? Or their emotions? You know, for example, like telling a mother that her missing son would return alive or breaking up a family by advising for divorce. You know what I mean? Have you ever felt like you led somebody down the wrong path? No, I don't think so. You know, it's interesting, my wife, she's always wanted to go to Europe. I finally put this big trip together, then at the last second, she cancels. She says that she needed to be here for this big break in her acting career. A break that you told her was coming. I did. And I'm guessing it hasn't, huh? No. It will. Yeah, I don't think so. And why is that? She's dead. Her name was Samantha. Samantha King. Yeah. She'd been coming to you for years. Oh, Sa... oh, Samantha. Oh, gosh. Fluke accident. Wrong place, wrong time. But, you know, the funny thing is is that if we'd been on that trip, if she hadn't listened to you and we'd gone to Europe, she'd still be alive. Oh, God. Oh, you can't think that I had... You were giving her spiritual guidance. Guidance based on visions you were receiving from beyond the veil, from higher powers, right? And these visions, they interfered with her life, Beverly. And she is dead as a direct result. I am deeply sorry for your loss. Okay, then admit it. Admit it. Admit that all this, this is just a scam. That what you claim to do, your psychic routine... this is just a show, right? This is a performance here. Come on, Beverly. Come on. I'm afraid that I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Please? What happens when you die? I mean, everybody has a theory, a guess, a story that they'd like to believe. But at the end of the day, we don't know. Our ancestors worshiped fire and sacrificed children to vengeful gods. We didn't know any better back then. What's our excuse now? It's the 21st century, yet we're still arguing evolution versus creationism. And why? Because the truth scares people. Nobody wants to die. Nobody wants to cease to exist. We want to believe that if we follow a set of rules, rules that were laid out by some ancient, made-up god, we're gonna continue on in heaven as a spirit. We're gonna be reincarnated. While all that sounds great, is any of it authentic? I mean, what's the truth? See, the truth is that religion and spiritualism are the most profitable businesses in the world. That throughout history, there's never been a single shred of evidence that any of it is real. Well, I've decided to prove it. I want to test the most authentic spells, rituals, and summonings that I can find. I'm only going after the blackest of the black magic. The stuff that people are scared of. So that when they don't work, people will pay attention. And maybe, just maybe, the world can take a step forward collectively into reality. The cameras will be rolling on me 24/7 in the hopes that if I uncover anything, anything at all, I'll have found the first ever documented proof. I'm the testing ground. Me, Michael King. So, God or the devil, if you're out there, prove it. Come and get me. Ladybug, what are you doing? Why are you up? I had a scary dream. Uh-oh. Come here. What was it about? A monster. A monster? Okay. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if this particular monster is a tickle monster. Come on. Come here, come here. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. See, Fishbone's right. Old Crowley here... old Crowley here is the best defense against tickle monsters. - Get away! Get away! - What are you doing? - Hey, sis. - What's going on? Oh, we are... she had a nightmare. Yeah, take Crowley with you. Hey, listen. Why don't I get in bed with you and make sure that there are no more monsters? - Okay. - Okay? I think that's a great idea. I'm really good at fending off monsters. Aunt Beth is the best. Hey, young lady. Where do you think you're going? Are you okay? All right, give me kisses. - I love you. - I love you, too, Dad. Crowley's gonna take care of you, okay? - And Fishbone. - Okay. What is all this stuff, Michael? I mean, you wonder why she's getting all these nightmares? Seriously? It's my new project. Oh, right. What? I thought that you would be happy, of all people, to see me, you know, getting back to work and moving on. This isn't really moving on, Michael. - Well, it is for me. - Okay. I'm gonna go put her to bed. Okay, so last night I posted an ad. Documentary filmmaker seeks proof of the supernatural. There must be, I don't know, over 300 hits on this thing already. We've got Satanists, voodoo, necromancy. I even have a priest on here. I guess that's Los Angeles for you, right? We're gonna have no shortage of material, that's for sure. What if one of these fucking Satanists is a serial killer? - What then? - Are you serious? Don't be such a pussy. So, Father Gibbons, the Church won't talk about it publicly, but behind closed doors you claim they're performing exorcisms. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. And these demons that they're exorcising, is there any proof that they're real? A physical proof? Like horns and brimstone? Fire, that kind of thing? Well, any kind of thing. I just don't understand why there's never been any documented evidence. What makes you think there's not? I haven't seen any. Well, I mean, of course you haven't. You haven't been allowed to. Okay, listen, you stated in your e-mail that you had a real experience, real proof, but you don't, do you? Okay. When I was 10, my father... he started to take advantage of me. Every night he would come into my room... close the door... My mother, she must have known. She prayed all the time. That was her remedy. God. Well, I prayed to God, but He never stopped my father, not once. So I gave up on God. Started to pray to the devil. Told him I would do anything if he'd just make my father stop. Well, one night not long after, in the middle of one of his visits, my father had a heart attack. Died on the spot. Wow. That's awful. I mean, what happened to you, it's awful. But come on. I mean, how is that anything more than just a strange coincidence? Well, not long after, I... began to hear him calling out to me, saying things. I mean, awful, awful things. The devil? You hear him... you don't answer. Because if you do, he will know you're listening and he will never let you go. Hmm. Right. Thank you for your time. Appreciate it. I ordered a demon summoning kit off the Internet. I lit the traditionally evil-looking black candles. I even sprung for the expensive incense because their Internet site said that the demons get insulted by the cheap stuff. Got one plastic ritual altar. Nice. Very nice. And one photocopied booklet. A lot of money went into that guy right there, huh? I also used Ellie's coloring set to draw my symbols. Somehow crayons seemed appropriate. So basically what you do is this. You draw the symbol for the demon that you wish to summon. All right? You read the spell from this. Then you light it, put it in the altar. Voila. Instant demon. Well, surprise, surprise, the demons were a no-show. Although... ...something's happening. Okay, there's no demon. It was worth a shot. So we got in touch with a demonologist. And after negotiating a small... well, smallish... fee, we've convinced him to summon a demon for us. Just a sec. Hi. Michael King. This is Jordan. So why do people always summon demons, never angels? People summon angels all the time. They just don't want to interfere. Now, demons, on the other hand, they're just dying to come here. It's most tempting to do that when we're kind of weak, out of sorts. Some people meditate for years to achieve the proper mind set, but we use tricks... to get us there faster. - Uh, grape juice? - With LSD. How much LSD? If you're nervous about this part, we should stop right now. There are two prevalent methods for summoning demons. The first is by offering the demon something up front. A human life, continued servitude, your own soul. I don't recommend those paths as once performed they're very hard to undo. The second method entails creating the type of frenetic atmosphere demons are drawn to... chaos, blood, sex, violence. I'll need some of your essence. Uh, saliva? Semen. You're kidding, right? And I have to get it in this cup? - Bathroom's right over there. - Okay. Ever hear of auto writing? Scrying? Psychography? It's how we're going to pick your demon, - the one we're going to summon. - Okay. Close your eyes. Now, clear your mind. Open yourself up to the beyond. Allow their energy to flow through you, to use you. Let their energy flow. Breathe. Breathe. I'm sorry, I'm not very susceptible to this kind of stuff. - I'm sorry. - You did just fine. Just a minute here. So what are we looking for here? What's this? To see if the image that you drew matches up with one of the demons. And you think that I drew this? Look. Daungore. "Commander of 37 legions. Seeker of the defenseless, the weak-spirited, the nonbeliever. Known also as the Great Mocker, Destroyer of Thought, Breeder of Ants, Stealer of Children. He comes accompanied by the sound of cacophonous music, staying with the conjurer until tormentum in dum demens." It's Latin for "torture until madness." I feel pretty weird, man. Okay, look at this, man. This look safe to you? This is fucked up. This is fucked up. Look at all this plastic. They're gonna kill me in here. That's what they're gonna do. Oh, my God. I'm losing my mind. This is a bad idea. This is bad. Jordan, check this out. Dude, maybe we should get the fuck out of here. Oh, my God, what the fuck have we gotten ourselves into? Oh, shit. These are real. Satan. Lucifer. Okay, so what are you doing here? I'm freaking out a little bit. Oh, God. Oh, God. Jordan? Jordan, what the fuck is going on, man? Something's fucking up the camera. I can't see shit. Hey, hey, hey! Michael, are you okay? Are you all right? Oh, shit. She's got a knife. Get that fucking knife off of him! Get it off of him! Jesus Christ! Well... that was, like, some kind of satanic porn shoot. The smell in there, right? And you paid him. Come on, man, shh. Seriously, turn that off. So you want me to order you some chili? Runny eggs? Or how about a cup of bloody jizz? Don't. Don't. Don't. I'm never eating again. At least enjoy the acid. Ready? You're running through a forest. You're running through a forest. Don't, dude. Don't. Seriously, come on. I hate you. Turn it off. So necromancy is considered the blackest of the black arts. Why is that? Well... I think it gets most of its bad rap because of the method employed in performing it. You mean dealing with corpses, graves, funeral rites. Right, right. That kind of creeps people out. Sure. But as a mortician, it's all part of my day job. And as far as the magic goes... it's really no different than what any of these mediums are doing except we just employ a slightly different method in raising the dead. Teeth taken from our little friend over there. A freshly deceased body works best because the soul may still be lingering. Then we can kind of confuse it. You know, make it think that it's still alive and that all it needs to do is just get back inside of its living body. Okay. This is a mild anesthetic similar to Novocain. - Okay. Doing all right? - Yeah. Okay, it'll start to numb in just a couple minutes. The more that we can make you appear like that body the soul once inhabited, the better our chances. You feel that? - No. - Okay. The astral corpse, it wants to keep living. Living is what it knows. You know? And unless it's already grown accustomed to the afterlife, it's what's normal. And it's desperate to cling on to that. The Sonoran Desert toad contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, the most powerful psychedelic on the planet. The human body produces DMT. It's released when we die. It helps us pass to the other side. But taking it while we're still living simulates a near-death experience. I'm going to need to let it dry. Prepare it. It's gonna take some time. We need to wait until it's dark anyhow. This Novocain is wearing off on my stomach, so this is starting to hurt like a bitch, man. Oh, there he is. Hey, sorry we're late. I got all turned around in here. Jesus Christ. Did you kill these... did you kill these things? The toads, their pain, agony, it creates this sort of energy that draws in the spirits. Assume the position. On your back. Right. The smell of burning DM can be intensely nauseating. Like burning plastic. Now, as it takes effect, the world will shatter and your body will quickly follow. You may feel like you're starting to die, like you don't know how to breathe at all. But it's okay. You just need to let go and go with it. To Almighty God we commend our brother Michael... and commit his body to the ground. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Roland Sykes. Roland Sykes, reclaim your physical body. Take this body. Shit! - You, hey! - Get the fuck out of here. - Get on your knees! - Michael. - Where are you? - They're running. Oh, fuck me. He's making a break for it. Hey! - There he goes! - Michael. Hey, you in here? Michael, you in here? Michael. Crawl. Crawl! Fuck! - Crawl. - What is that? What the fuck is going on here? Crawl. Shit. Michael. Michael. Come on, get down, man. Get down from there. Let's get out of here. Come on. Are you okay? I don't want to be dead. Get off, Mike! Oh, Jesus. Jordan? Jordan? You're tripping out, man. It's just the drugs. Dude, just chill. Oh, no. No, no. Fuck. She's gone. Who's gone? Sam. I was with her, man. I was with Sam. But she's fucking gone. Come on, let's just get the fuck out of here. - Steal it! - How did we get so lucky? - Come on! - I know, she's amazing. Fishbone, eh. He doesn't come when he's called so much. - Yeah. - Ew, this is gross now, too. - Here you go. - No, no, don't give it to me. My wife Samantha was... I mean, I fucking touched her. You know, and I felt her with... And she was trying to tell me something. It was... there was all this interference. It was like static. And I couldn't make out what she was saying. But she was... Took a shower. Got rid of these fucking teeth. Look at this. I feel like I'm still coming down from the drugs or something. And that static sound, it's, like, still there. I've got to get some sleep. I can't sleep. Man, it's like 4:30, 5:00. Something like that. Sun's gonna be coming up soon. I'm just past the point. And that noise, it's, like, now that I've noticed it, I'm... I'm fixated on it. Hey there. We're at this reading by Erica Bell. She's a relatively well-known medium. And then afterwards we get to interview her. So come on, let's check it out. Okay, was there something with her throat? Her breathing? She had esophageal cancer. She wants you to know she's okay. She's watching over you. And you're... no, hang on. No, wait a minute. Someone else is butting in here. Lots of spirits want to talk today. This is good. Okay. All right, somewhere over here. Yes. Yes, this is a very strong signal. Female, I think. She really, really wants to talk. Right, she passed recently. Happened kind of quickly, an accident maybe. Okay, she has a message. No, that can't be right. She wants to... Michael, listen to me. You need to... Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy. Jesus Christ. What happened? We're not really sure. Erica was about to tell us something and then she went into that seizure. I mean, was she actually channeling Sam? Or was that just all part of her show? And then the seizure was just like a strange coincidence or something. I don't know. Dad, Fishy peed on the floor again. Huh? Okay, baby. Daddy will take care of it after dinner, all right? - Thanks. Oh, fuck! - Jeez. Why the fuck would you hand me something like that? It's scalding hot. God damn it. Michael, that's a salad. Um, I'm sorry. I'm just... Daddy's a little tense. I'm sorry about that. You okay? I scared you. You okay? Yeah. Have some salad, Ellie. I thought if I went out today that I could shake this noise in my head, that it would just go away. But now that I'm home and it's quiet, it's like... I wish I could describe for you what this is. It's this constant barrage, this cacophony of sound. It's like... it's like... Oh, fuck. Okay, so what's the deal again? Like I said, it came out of my mouth. Uh-huh. Yeah, no. Why not? There's multiple layers of overtone singing. Overtone? What does that mean? It's when a singer manipulates their voice to have multiple pitches at the same time. Okay, good. So then maybe I did it accidentally. Well, even if I bought that, which I don't, there's more. Here. Let's see. This is a B2. - Okay. - And this is a C# 7. That's a Guinness Book vocal range right there. The tape you gave me... we're talking F # all the way... E25. Some of it's not even audible. Just barely registering on my stuff. Let me ask you this. Is it possible that my vocal cords could have made this? Not a chance. If you're not fucking with me, then there's something wrong with the audio in your camera. A defect or something. It's not the camera. Thanks. Michael. So fricking loud. Michael? Hello? What are you doing? Hey. Michael. Oh, my God. You scared me. Let's go. I've been calling you. Dinner's ready. Chronic ringing of the ears. It's a very common condition. It's called tinnitus. - You should see an internist. - I did. I did. He gave me a clean bill of health. Said that it must be psychosomatic, that I should see a psychiatrist, which is why I'm here. I understand, Michael, that your wife died recently. Six months ago, yeah. Left you alone with a little girl. Ellie, uh-huh. You might be going through some extreme stress trying to deal with thoughts, feelings, emotions, things that consciously you might not think you can handle. And so then they become side effects. All right, so you think you can, I don't know, help me come to grips with this if that's what it is? Breathe. Good. Let your thoughts, your conscious, drift away. Nice and easy. We're traveling deep into your subconscious, Michael. Deep down inside. Michael? Are you there? Are you with me? Yes. How are you feeling? - Fine. - Good. That sound in your head, is it still there? Yes. - Okay. - But there's something else. What? I know what the sound is. What is it, Michael? Voices. - Voices? - Yes. What are they saying? So many things. Anything in particular? - Yes. - What? They're saying you will... What? You will what, Michael? You will... Michael? Crawl. Michael, are you okay? Michael. Hey! What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? The camera jumped out of my hands. You made some weird voice. Bullshit. It's all on the camera. And then you were talking about all the sounds in your head, they were voices. Look, I know this is none of my business, but... you think Sam would want you to be doing this? So Jordan officially left the project. Is something really happening to me? I mean, I'm physically exhausted. I'm drained. And I was hypnotized, you know? Is it really that surprising that I spoke in some weird voice? I mean, I think that Jordan just got startled and threw the camera. That's what it looked like. I don't know. Okay, I'm back. And this thing going on in my head, it's evolving. It's like I can hear this... mumbling now. Like my subconscious is trying to talk to me or something. And if I concentrate... I can almost tell what it's saying. Must have flown into the window. Crowley loves you. Hey, sweetie. Did that noise wake you up? That was just the window. It broke. It was just the window. It's okay. What is it? You all right? - The monster. - Monster? Oh, from your dream. Okay. Okay. Let's see. I'll tell you what. How about you go back to sleep, and then maybe Daddy will show up in your dream and then he can chase that monster away. How's that? You can't. Really? Why is that? I saw the monster. Well, that's good. What did this monster look like? It's you, Daddy. It's me? It's just a bad dream. You know that, right? And Daddy would never hurt you, okay? No matter what. Why don't you go get Fishbone and go get back in bed, okay? I can't find her. Come on, girl. What you doing, Fishy? Let's see, that bird should be right about here. Huh. That's weird. Fishbone. Is that you, girl? Oh, where the fuck are you? What the fuck? Whoa, Jesus Christ! Fuck. What the fuck is that? Ellie! Beth! Ellie! Beth! Jesus. Michael. What the hell? What are you doing? She's asleep. What are you doing? Michael, what is wrong? We'll find the dog, okay? Just relax. Look, will you please stop acting like this? I'm sorry. I'm just... You're just acting, like, crazy, so... - You all right? - Are you all right? - Yeah. - You look like shit. Have you slept lately? Oh, God. I just can't seem to wind down. Hold on. Here. Take two of these. - Sleeping pills? - Yup. Then you will sleep, believe me. Feel better in the morning. Thank you. Good night. I thought if I got a good night's sleep that this would end. But these voices, they're not going away. I need to confront this. So... are you real? Or am I going insane? Neither is an appealing choice, but... I suppose one of them must be true. I guess I'd rather... you were real. Okay. Okay. What if... what if I said... what if I said that you've proved your existence? That I believed in you? I believe in you. Would you just... would you leave? No. We're gonna fuck you up. Hi. Oh, is Father Gibbons here? I'm sorry, no. Kill her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, it is urgent. I need to speak to Father Gibbons right now. - And you are? - Just get Father... I'm Michael King. I'm Michael King. I interviewed him and I need to talk... - I need to talk to him right... - I'm sorry. Father Gibbons passed a few days ago. He's... he's... okay. Listen, I need an exorcism. - An exorcism? - Yeah. - The Church doesn't do that. - No, you do it. I know you do. Father Gibbons told me that you do. I need an exorcism, please. He was rather out of sorts towards the end. I'm sorry if he misled you. He didn't mislead me. I need help. Excuse me. There's nothing we can do for you. - Sorry, we can't help you. - Father, I need your help. - I'm sorry. - Oh. Okay. Okay. Excuse me a moment. - You can't come here. - How do I get rid of it? - How do I make it go away? - What are you talking about? I mean this thing. This thing in my fucking head. I warned you something like this might happen. Now I need you to get the fuck out. Hey. What the fuck have you done to me? - What is this thing? - What? I don't understand. Something's got a hold of me. You did something. - You summoned something. - No, man, it's not for real. - It's all for fun. - Bullshit, you're lying. Get up. Get up. Easy. Please. Please help me. - Now get out of here. - Please. I need your help. I really need to talk to her. I need to come in and I need to see her. But isn't that what she's supposed to do is help somebody that's in a situation like what I'm in? I'm hearing shit and I'm seeing shit now. Listen, I'm losing my fucking mind. Would you please just tell Dr. Cox that I need to talk to her? Can you do that for me? Oh! You don't know how fucking desperate I am here, okay? You're supposed to help people. Well, I need your fucking help! I don't know what to fucking do. Dad. Can I play my game? Tell me... do you miss your mommy? Yeah. You can be with her, you know. Hey, Ellie, come on. Let's go get a bath. So long. Ladybug. Come on, let's go. I don't feel like myself at all anymore. I'm starting to have these crazy thoughts. I feel compelled. Like I have to. Like I have to fucking do it. Eyes are throbbing like mad. Can you see this? Aw, it hurts like hell. I'm fucking slipping. What? Oh, my God. No, God damn it, no! What the fuck? What the fuck is that? Oh, my God. What happened? Beth? Ellie? Fuck! Ellie! Ellie! - Crowley loves you. - Ellie. Ellie. Is that Fishy? - No, baby. - Are you okay? - Ellie, sweetheart. - No, no. Beth, you don't think... Beth, I didn't. - I don't want to leave Fishy! - Ellie. - Let me go! - Ellie. Oh, God. Oh. What have I done? Fish. You... you don't have power over me. You don't. You think you do, but you don't. This isn't what I wanted. This isn't what I wanted at all. I'm sorry, Sam. You can't make me do anything. Shh. Couldn't make me lower. You are just in my fucking head. Get out of my head! I thought I almost killed Ellie. Fishbone was Sam's dog. Fuck. Beth and Ellie, they're staying with one of Beth's friends for a few days. It's getting too hard to fucking concentrate. Quiet! Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Stop saying that, God damn it! Shit! Stop! "I command you, unclean spirit. You shall not be emboldened to harm this creature of God. You shall not harm him or those he touches. I command you, release this body. Release this body..." "Turn back this evil upon my soul. I beseech you, Lord. I beseech you." Burn! Burn! - Burn! - Fuck! God damn it! You can't have this body. No! No, God damn it! Fuck! Fuck! God, please! I've tried everything. Protective spells, banishments, charms, every incantation I can find. Nothing's worked. The more I try and fight it, the more it takes over. Forcing me to do things. Laughing at me. It's fucking laughing at me. You'd think this really hurts, right? Funny thing is I can hardly feel it. It's getting harder and harder to feel anything. It's like... none of this is real anymore. It's not real. Nothing is real. See this? Look at that. No matter how many times I kill it... ah, there. Oh, yeah. See this? See? Another one. Okay. I've been doing this all day long. Look at that bastard. You son of a bitch. Fuck. Another one. God damn it. If I let it crawl on my body, there's only one. The second I kill it, another one shows up. The girl. I know, okay? I know what you want! We want the girl. - You can't have her. - We can make you do it. - You can't have her. - Someone else. - Someone else. - Okay. Okay. I'll do it. I'll do it. But you can't have Ellie. You hear me? You can't have Ellie. Kill her. Now. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her! We want you to kill her. Kill. Kill him. Sorry, Ellie. I just... I couldn't do it. I just... I have to fucking get some sleep. Goddamn rest. You're not going anywhere! Okay, we're not going anywhere. We're fuckin' sleeping. No, we're not going out. Yes, you will! What the fuck? Oh, no. Michael. - Jordan, I'm in here. - Michael? - Michael. - Yeah. Jesus Christ, what the fuck is going on in here? Your place is a dis... Jesus. Key is over there. Do you mind getting it for me? Oh, fuck. We need to get you some serious help, all right? You gonna check into a facility? I'm serious, man. If I unlock you, we are going there right now. Answer the fucking... what am I doing? Jordan? Oh! Oh, fuck! There was a being inside a light and... I don't know if it was an angel or... God. It asked me if I was prepared to move on. All I needed to do was let go. And I wanted to. But I held on because I needed to come back and tell you that everything was gonna be okay, that I'm okay. Because... the next time that it happens, I'm gonna let go. Michael, I know you have a hard time believing... but it's real. I know that now. I love you, Michael. I always will. There's a few things I need to say to Ellie. Why the fuck didn't I listen to you? My little ladybug. So sad I'm not gonna see you grow up - into the beautiful... - Fuck! stunning little angel you already are. - Please just know that I'm with you. - No! You can't. - I'm always there. - You can't have this body. It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay. Kill me! Fuck. Here we go. These cameras, this film... it's proof. I hope someone finds it and uses it to show others. Tell my story, please. Someone tell my story. Tell my daughter... tell my daughter her daddy never meant for any of this to happen. Tell her that... tell her that Daddy loves her. Tell her... tell her her daddy loves... You ought to kill her. - No. No. - Do it. No! Leave me alone. Why? We're having fun. I love you. Okay, now go... Fishy, what are you doing? Get out of that. - That's not yours. - Oh, no, he ate all the popcorn. - Baby. Come here. - That dog is like a disposal. Now puke. Puke. Give it back. Put your fingers down his throat. Mouth to mouth. We're together now, Michael. Isn't it wonderful? I had it wrong, didn't I? The interference, the chattering, the noise... those weren't demons. That wasn't you. Those were angels. Something. Trying to... trying to warn me. Trying to keep me from hearing the real voices... the real singing. Because once you hear it, you can never stop listening. I'm gonna go get Crowley. Michael? Oh, my God. What the...? Michael. Michael, you're scaring me. Michael, it's me. It's Beth. Please. Daddy? Let's play. No. Ellie, run. Run from Daddy. Go. Ellie, I'm coming to get you. We're gonna rip her head off. No. Run, Ellie. Go. We're gonna eat her, Michael. Where are you hiding, ladybug? Crowley loves you. No. No. Ellie. Yes. Ladybug. Where are you? Daddy's coming to find you. Crowley loves you. No. Daddy! Sam. Is that you? Go quickly. No, Daddy. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. - Get her, Fishbone. - He's coming. Run. Get her. Oh, God. Careful, baby. Your turn. What is your New Year's resolution? To make a documentary about this family so that I can show the whole world what a lucky guy I am. - You are a lucky guy. - That's right. And I thank God every day. If only you believed in God. Yeah, that'd probably help a little bit. Oh, crap. You know what? I didn't put change in that meter. We're gonna get a ticket. - Dad, can you help me? - What's up? - Here, I got it. - You sure? - Yup. - Thanks, babe. Of course. Come on, get it. Come get it. Fetch! We're too good. Atta boy. Sam! Help! - Somebody help! - Mommy! I can taste the power Now there's something real Something real to feed me Inside your naked world Your body works forever I'm electric with your tears Your soul came into the darkness Of everlasting fear Why don't you bow down now? Make me feel like I'm someone Bow down now, roll over Make me feel like I'm someone God made you to serve me I know I've lost control She's the liquid flesh you feel Fills your empty soul The master's love is torture As your innocence knows the game So what you can't remember Is working for your shame Why don't you bow down now? Make me feel like I'm someone Bow down now, roll over Make me feel like I'm someone Give me What I need to Give you Give me What I need to Give you Why don't you bow down now? Make me feel like I'm someone Bow down now, roll over Make me feel like I'm someone Bow down now, roll over Make me feel like I'm someone Bow down now, roll over Make me feel like I'm someone Bow down now, bow down now Bow down now Bow down now.
