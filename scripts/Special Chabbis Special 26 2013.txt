He's the Sl who helped them conduct the rain. Poor guy, he was humiliated. He conducted an investigation... ...and gathered this information. There have been 13 such cases in the last 2 years. These are the ones that were detected. No one knows the real number of cases. Fake CBl, lncome Tax or ACB teams conduct a raid... ...and the victims never report. Rumours are spreading. There's a theory that they're ex-CBl. Strange. Anyway, we've to stop this nonsense. They're slandering our name. Madras(Chennai), Nagpur, Trivandrum. Lucknow. Sir, it's all over the country. They mostly target businessmen and politicians. Because there's black money involved... ...no one wants to report it. Which party do these politicians belong to, sir?

Will you tell me what exactly happened? lt was the 26th of January. l was on duty. l received a call. 'Tughlak Road police station, hello.' 'Jai Hind.' 'Jai Hind. - Who's this?' 'Sl Ranveer Singh.' 'This is Ajay Singh from CBl ward 16.' 'From additional director PK Sharma's office.' 'Who is the officer on duty? - That's me, sir. We need some men, to conduct a raid.' 'How many, sir?' 'Fourjunior constables, and one lady constable along with you.' 'That will be enough. - Where's the raid?' 'Even we don't know that.' 'Only Mr. Sharma knows.' 'Meet us at Safdurjung in 15 minutes.' 'Jai Hind. - Jai Hind.' Four of them. - Yes, sir. Then? Then... 'You just can't barge in here...' 'Keep the phone down.' 'Believe me, there's nothing in here.' 'Madam, please step aside.' 'Guddu's papa, stop them. - Let go of him.' Ranveer Singh, did someone tell you or did you... lf you had been in my place then... lf l had been in your place this situation would've never come up. l didn't join the CBl to screw up! l admit my mistake, Waseem sir. l don't have to listen to your taunts. l came here because l needed your help. lf you help me we can solve this case quickly. Otherwise, don't be mistaken that l've admitted defeat. lt will take me longer alone... ...but, l won't rest until l don't put an end to this. That's what l wanted to hear. Co-ordinate with all the police stations. - Yes, sir. And Ranveer, you will check all the police records yourself... ...because you're the only one who have seen them. - Sir. Let's hope we find their police records. When can we meet the minister? Yes. What is it? Sir, this is Waseem Khan. From CBl. Again? He's the real one. Hello. Taxi. Bada Bazaar. Joginder. - Sir. Ajay.

Quick. Aggarwal Traders? - Poddar Traders. - 214! What's this? Why do you mess up? Can't you see the numbers properly? You'll make me lose my job. You've grown old. We were supposed to go to 124... ...instead you brought us to 214. See? - Sorry, sir. Sorry! lt's time for you to retire. - Yes. lt happens sometimes. Things mess up. lt's ok. Sorry, it was a slight blunder. You can continue. You can get on with yourjob, and we'll get back to ours. Let's go. - Yes. Aggarwal Traders. We're from the lncome Tax. No calls allowed. None. Sir... - Quiet. Sir, there's nothing. - Where's the key? Where's the key? - Sir... - Get it. Sir, the accounts... Sir, what have you done? l told you won't find anything. - Shut up. Come on. - Sir, sir... You're tearing the mattress. Where's the rest of the cash? - Sir... Where is it? - Sir, please. Where's the money? - lqbal. Where's the cash... Move this mattress. Hurry up.

Goodnight. Find anything? - Nothing, sir. Kolkata, Bada Bazaar. A fake income tax team of four conducted a raid. No business man wants to report this. But it will still be in tomorrow's newspapers. Let's make these rascals nervous. Congratulations. Bogus lncome Tax... Four people came dressed... Ajay. Sir. - Sir. Sir. Sir. Found him. Are you sure? - 100% . He said his name was P.K.

These two wires shouldn't touch each other. lf they do, then you hear that 'Whoosh' sound. Don't you clean it? That's the problem. People don't clean their telephone sets... ...and we're burdened with all the work. You see, the circumference can be cleaned... ...from inside as well as outside. Let's check. Hello, sir.

Life is passing by, when will you come? Come in. How are you, Mr. Sharma? We're from the CBl. The real one. So, Mr. Sharma. You like playing cops-and-robbers, don't you? No, l was just... l will ask you some questions, and you will have two options. Firstly, you will deny everything... ...and say you don't know anything. ln that condition, we'll be compelled to do it and... ...in places, which was never done to you before by anyone. lt will cause you a lot of pain but, believe me... ...you will suddenly remember everything in detail. l... l... Your second option is that you cooperate with us... ...and save our time and effort. This option won't cause you any pain... ...and you can expect us to be slightly lenient with us. So, let's begin. First question, where's your fake CBl team... ...going to conduct a raid tomorrow? Bhuvandas Singhania Jewels. What time? - 3 pm. What's Special 26? lt... was a big place, so we thought... ...if we have more men with us... So you put an ad in the paper... ...stating Come one, come all, it's a big heist. Help us. What's the plan? Tomorrow morning we'll give them training. Training? l mean we'd explain them their role... ...like what to do, how to do it. We would explain them all that and prepare them. And then at 2:30, our bus would reach the hotel. Then? We were supposed to go to Opera House in it... ...and conduct a big raid. We're from the CBl! No one moves! Come on, start. Come on, get it. Get in, quickly. Come on, come on, quickly. Hurry up. Sir.. please sir.. sorry sir.. Pick up everything. We would flee before anyone knew what happened? We planned to loot 2 crores in 30 minutes. What's your Ajju's background? He wanted to join the CBl. He had cleared the written exam. But failed in the interview. He failed in the exam and he was hurt. So he started a fake CBl team. How many raids have you conducted so far? We were supposed to complete half century tomorrow. What the... l've to admit one thing. There's just four of you... ...but you've spread a chaos. Not four. People like him help us as well. Sir, can l talk to him in private for a minute? Why a minute, you can talk to him all you want tomorrow. Yes. So, tell us, Mr. Sharma. Do you want to be safe or go down with them? Let me tell you... ...jail isn't a great place for people of your age. Sir... sir, another option. l've children. You should've thought that before. l did... Tell us. We don't have time. Mr. Sharma. What will l have to do? Just do as you were supposed to. Forget that we ever met. Everything should go as it was supposed to. Let me tell you, that a few of our officers... ...are in your Special 26 team. So don't try to act smart. l want to arrest them, not kill them. What's wrong? l just remembered something. Ajju always said There's no one who can catch him. Over-confidence has led to the downfall of many, Mr. Sharma. Ajju's no different. Will you treat him too harsh... Stop worrying about him and think about yourself. Get some sleep. You've a busy day tomorrow. Goodnight. Brief More and Gupte again. We'll meet tomorrow morning.

And yes, there's a message as well. See. Waseem sir, l wanted to return it personally... ... but l am helpless. Your hard-earned money is no use to me. Yours, Ajju. 'lt's yours, isn't it?' 'Yes, it is.' 'Thank you.' Here you go. We were about to miss the bus... - Rahul's called. Yes, Rahul. - Sir, we've information about them. Couple of years ago, maybe three years ago. One would have never associated him with a shot like this. But l think he has come to learn and life.. ..in one day cricket and has played some really good shots. Shot! Six! Once more, he has to do it. ln the youth, was on the streets. Half the world are sinners. Who is original, all is a copy. Whole life is hectic. His neck, his legs. His loin cloth, her veil. His finger, his hair, hold it and get your work done. Don't be over confident, life is catch and hold. Catch and hold. Catch and hold. Catch the thief by his tail. Everything is related to food. Police and thieves, cat and mouse, whether it is Mumbai, Patna or Delhi. Everyone is playing catch. But money has a good hold. The world is an animal, money leads this animal. The money should come any how. Whether white or black. Everyone is running after this money. There is a lot of attitude with this. lf its black then catch it. Catch and hold. Catch and hold. Catch and hold. Youth is stuck in the yes or no of love. lf she says yes, then movie and coffee. lf she says no, then sister, forgive me. The world comes in between, but love continues. Whether you have sense or no, still it continues. Catch the one on the way. Catch and hold. Catch and hold. Catch and hold. Catch and hold. Catch and hold. Catch and hold.
