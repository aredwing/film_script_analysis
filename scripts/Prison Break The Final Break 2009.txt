Your friend, Fernando, tells me you could use my services today. Very much so. And I assume that's the other half of your team? You look beautiful. Thank you. And it's my understanding you'd like to keep this simple? We've never actually managed to keep anything simple... You could try. Well. Let's begin then, shall we? Family and friends, we gather here... to celebrate the union between Michael Scofield and Sara Tancredi. - Sorry to break up the party. - What the hell's going on? We have an arrest warrant. - What? - Wait, wait, wait. We talked to Agent Paul Kellerman in D.C. We've settled this with the feds. We settled this with the feds weeks ago! Sir, back up! - We were exonerated. - Sir... - We were exonerated! - Back up! We're not here for you. We're here for her. She didn't do anything. She wasn't involved. Don't make this escalate! Sara Tancredi, you're under arrest for the murder of Christina Hampton. What?! She didn't kill anyone! Funny. Surveillance camera footage says different. Michael. - Please, right this way. - Michael. - Second car, please. - Michael! - Second car. - What's going on? Back up, please. S04E23: The Old Ball And Chain They're not gonna let me see her. Why did Kellerman send you if you can't do anything? They're trying to break both of you. Look, she has a constitutional right to reasonable visitation. I'll draw up an order to show cause and get it before the judge immediately. While you're at it, - can you argue in self defence? - How? Anything that might help her is out of frame. Security camera only shows Sara stepping up and firing at the victim. - Pull the trigger, Michael. - Drop... the gun! Misfire. - She worked for the Company. - To you. To a jury, she's Christina Hampton, Technology Consultant. And because she was so good at hiding her true identity, we can't prove otherwise. Look, you were all exonerated. It did not sit well with law enforcement. If they can make Sara pay for it, they will. How much time is she looking at? You. Over here. You. Here. You. Here. This one's yours. Am I supposed to be in a different facility? I don't think so. I haven't been convicted of anything yet. I'm supposed to be in a jail. This is prison. Overcrowding and budget cuts, fish. This is the jail. That's the prison. 'Sup, homie? You need some help? You got everything you need over there? Why don't you go help and make her bed? Don't let them spook you. They just like to intimidate. They are good at it. Look. This jail-prison hybrid thing's B.S. Come on. The other one's practically empty. You can ride it out to your court date there. Thank you. Here. This should be a little bit more comfortable for you. Okay. What's going on? You know... At first, I couldn't place your name. Tancredi. It sounded so familiar. But then, Haggs here, figured it out. I remembered your pretty face from the papers. You're not going anywhere, fish. This is going to happen. Half a dozen guards lost their jobs and pensions at Fox River. Another dozen were put on probation, after you decided to leave the door open for your boyfriend and his seven convict pals. And we... ain't gonna let anything like that happen again. Don't worry, we won't hit the baby basket. That's right. Looked like that welcome wagon ran over your face. It looks that way, huh? Alright, well... You need something, you just ask for me. Everybody calls me "Daddy". Special delivery. You know, all we need is a little cash, spread around in places. I told you. The government's exposing my assets. You tellin' me you can't get your hands on the cash? Unless, that's the least you could do. Considering you was gonna kill me not too long ago. Goodbye, Theodore. You ain't never been incarcerated before, and I never been incarcerated here. Therefore, now let's just say this handicapped connie got the juicy hand back in Fox River. Your pathetic existence here could be ameliorated. As can my life, all with a little "Roberto de Niro". One of our friends has been apprehended by the authorities. Looks like we've got a new neighbour. I'm never gonna get out of this prison alive. I know that. I wanna bring my enemy down with me. I want her dead. Either way, it's going to require a capital. A capital you no longer have. My rainy day plan. Do you know where it is? Jonathan. I'd assume that that would be used for your defense. It's good money after bad, Joe. They're not gonna let me out of here. No matter how many shots, it's that hard. Get that. To our friend, in the sister cells, across the compound. Officer Johnson... Officer Riley, could you come to your extension in 30 seconds... Excuse me. Bad move. Last time someone touched her, they got a crack kneecap. You're much braver than I gave you credit for. Either that, or you're amazingly nice. Do I look like I wanna talk to you? I just say, a woman in your position laid up for some protection. Join the prison gang? I don't think so. Not a gang. No. A family. They don't call her "Daddy" for nothin'. That's her wife. And those are her kids. - Are you okay? - Stay the hell away from me. I need to go down the infirmary. Can't go down the infirmiary without a release form. I'm having muscle contractions on my throat. And my jaws' tightening up. It's--It's just could be indigestions, I'm not poisoned. No. That's the government cheese. You'll get used to it. If I don't get to the hospital in the next 15 minutes, I will die and my baby will die. Please. Boss. Why don't you let her go see the doc? Please. This is Kaorla. Inmate going to the infirmary. We were able to administer the charcoal labrigintein. You and your baby are gonna be okay. You know the strignein didn't get into my meatloaf all by itself, right? Well then, you need to talk to the warden about it. Then how about talking to me about your face? You want to tell me how that happened? I caught an elbow playing basketball. We should discuss your... situation. As I'm sure you've ascertained this isn't going to be a run-of-the-mill pregnancy. Do I deliver in here? No. The day we induce, we'll secure you in an ambulance. We'll take you to St. Lucia down the road. We'll cordone off a room. There'll be three armed guards in there with me, when you give birth. Do I get to see my baby? You'll have 30 minutes before we take it away. I've seen this process a dozen times. After the mothers come back here, the depression's almost unbearable. My advice, it's a lot less messy, if you'd just think of yourself as a surrogate. Yeah? Michael, it's Lou Phillips. Listen, um... Your wife had an incident earlier today. Someone tried to poison her. What are you talking about? Michael, I need you to focus. Do you have any idea who might have done this? Michael? Michael?! Go ahead, let him in. If I had a list of all the people who might come to visit me... your name would be at the bottom, somewhere below Jesus Christ and Scooby Doo. - Someone tried to poison Sara today. - Mercy-- Only you would be depraved enough, to think that killing an innocent woman and her unborn child would bring you some kind of peace before your execution. Sara is with child? Congratulations! This is like the 4th of July and Christmas Day rolled into one. I am asking you, father to father, to leave her alone. You can kill me if you want to kill me, I'll trade my life for hers. But leave Sara alone. Michael... If you were killed, your pain would last a moment. If Sara were killed, your pain would last the rest of your life. Now that's got to be appealing to whoever put out this hit. But don't worry, Michael. If I find out anything, I'll be sure to let you know. Prison life can be tough. If I remember correctly, you have two missing toes that can attest to that bag. I don't think you understand. She's not safe here! Please. Please just approve the transfer to another facility. If I grant her a transfer, everybody's gonna want one. What about segregrated housing? Is there something that I should know about the structural integrity of shoe? I can see where this is going. I know who you are. And I'm not going to let you turn my prison into the next Fox River. All I'm trying to do, is keep my wife alive. You do know she's pregnant. I don't care. Here. Thanks. In case I haven't made myself clear-- Sara Tancredi is not getting any preferential treatment. And you've made yourself perfectly clear. Thank you for your time. - What happened? - The General wants Sara dead and the warden's just gonna let that happen. We gotta lure in the case if he's gonna get her out, right? Which is not enough time. She stays in that prison, someone's going to kill her. I guess we don't have a choice. We're breaking her out. In my 16 years in the Bureau, I've worked cases under Alexander Mahone, is the smartest, bravest, most honorable man, I've ever had the pleasure of serving with. As one of those 43 agents, I can't help but feel a bit offended. Because obviously, I am not as honoured as this drive-addicted murderer. Alex has been clean and sober for four months. And he's been completely exonerated of all crimes associated with his involvement with the Company. That doesn't include the shooting and murder of one Oscar Shales and burying his body under his bird bath-- That is just an allegation. Let's move on, shall we? All those in favor of reinstating Alexander Mahone, a Special Agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation-- Aye. - All those oppose? - Alright, alright, I've-- Thank you for the invite, Richard. It's always a pleasure. You know, Alex. This ruling can't be revisited. If you're able to sufficiently demonstrate, just how committed you are to a life of service. Now, as you may know, Sara Tancredi was arrested recently, and is currently being housed at the Miami Dade State Penitentiary. We have concerns that Michael Scofield may have other plans for her. So this... This is why you invite me in here. Well obviously, if Scofield were, to be able to pull off this plot of another breakout, the public embarassment will be immensed to the Bureau. So... having someone to get us credible information, that would be worth something to us. Agent Wheatley is set up in Miami. He would be your contact. You're something else. Now... We both know... how badly you want that badge back. Give me a reason to give it to you. What's your plan after we break her out? We're on the run again? First things first. Let's get her out of there. Hey, papi. The fed that arrested Sara, is outside, staking us out. Look, if you're worried about getting into trouble again, go back to Chicago, go back to your family. I'll understand. Are you kidding me? After all the crap we've been through, I'm just going to leave you here and Sara in there? You shut up and don't bring it up again. - What's all that? - Newspaper clippings-- Covering seven different escape attempts, from Miami Dade's State Pen, over the last 60 years. None of them-- None of them successful. So we weigh them all, and we learn what not to do. Well, the prison officials learned a lot. They re-evaluated, they retrofitted... The prison's pratically escape-proof. - Are you alright? - I'm fine-- I guess so if we can't go through, what if we go down? Like down into the prison? Like we parachute in. Yeah. Yeah. You parachute in, - you find her, and we get he rout. - Are you kidding? - I'm serious. - That's suicide! Hey, hey... Newspapers clippings only going to get us so far. We need some more information about the prison. So let's do some recon work. Camera, electronic tape measure, dry ice. What's this? It's a shopping list. You need to come with me, doc. I have a doctor's appointment for my pregnancy in a few minutes. It'll wait. In here. Hold it. I don't know what you want, but I promise you, I will go down and fight it. Damn baby, I ain't gonna hurt you. Hell, I ain't even gonna touch you. See, I run the motor pool detail in here. And I was thinkin' if you want to get yourself a little fresh air, and not have to worry about getting stuck in the back, then you could come in, work with me... You're the fed from my wedding. Yeah, you can call me Agent Wheatley. I could call you a lot of things. - Where you headed? - Sea World. Sea World? There isn't one in Miami. My loss. No. What really be your loss, is getting your wife killed, by doing something stupid. - Are you threatening Sara? - No, no. Not at all-- I'm just saying that if you were gonna try and revoke her sentence. Bullets fly, Michael. And if she'd get hurt, that'd be on you. Funny hearing that from the guy who put her in prison in the first place. No, I didn't put her in prison. State of Florida did. It's just my job to make sure that she stays there. So, uh... Where's all your little buddies? Alright. Drop in some more dry ice. Fence line is four feet... from the road. And 32 feet... from the east camera. Hurry up. They're gonna see the laser. I'm going as fast as I can, papi. - He followed you? - Yeah, but he's gone now. You guys almost done? Almost. Great. I'll meet you back at the loft. Well, you just a natural. I bet you was a hell of a surgeon. Handing out condoms to cons were makin' no damn surgeon! What in the hell is the matter with you? You ain't even ask me if she can come... One day, for real! Can we go one day without your mouth? One! Let it be today. I'm sorry. You got to forgive my old lady, she's... You just a little bit easy on eyes, you know? She's just the jealous type. Crazy type is more like it. What? You wanna watch your tone, Agatha. Sorry. Or you want me take off my belt? Sorry. Kid. It's rough. It's hard running a family. It's important though that, uh-- That you have one-- I have a family. I have a husband. Oh, you've got a husband? Is he here? They let him bring you in here, with you, when you came? No. Yeah, I had a husband too. is a long time to wait. So, you know. If this ain't for you, that's cool. Then you pick up that nasty oil, take it out and put it in the repository. Okay. We gotta go, bro. - Get your hands off me. - When I'm good and ready. What's Burrows doing by the fence? Please don't make me ask you again, Sara. Nobody here to help you, but yourself. Are you going to answer me? You tried to kill me. Line it up, cons. Go back inside. You, get back to your detail. Now! I want you to pass along an offer to your boy. What he's paying his people to dust that Tancredi chicken bitch pop... My woman are good for a cut rate. Just what kind of discount are you proposing here? Tell him, uh... He's offering a 100 grand, my girl will take 30. No, 40. Perfect. I'll tell him. Hey, five star. So you have no cash, whatsoever... I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you over the sound of that broken record. Got it. I won't ask again. Whose act is stupid as you look, huh? Oh, to what do we owe the honor? I've been thinking... Well, no need to be uh, shy. Just spit it out. I've changed my mind. No, well maybe, Daddy changed her mind. Maybe she don't want you here anymore. Sport's right. I recently have rolled up my welcome mat. Peace. - Please. - Please, what? Please, may I be a part of your family? Take a walk. Take a walk! I would love that. I would-- Sit down. I really would. You see, its not that easy. It's just saying "I do". See, in order to making a commitment... to a family... It's something you gotta prove. That's right, we all did it. It's a commitment... to the family code. It's a code you gotta wear. Alex! - What's up? - What-- How you doing, man? What's going on? We gotta talk. Alright. They're watching you. - We know. We gotta a fed on us. - No. Not just one. The whole department. Sounds a lot like inside information, Alex. What you do? Make a deal with the feds? They offered me my old job back, if I came down here to spy on you. Now the fed you're talking about, his name is Wheatley. He's running point. So now we know. So if you really gonna do this, you gotta do it right. And I'll help you if you need me. What else do you get? Sara was working the motor pool today at 4 o'clock. Motor pool is here. This hold by two security cameras, along the perimeter of the prison. What about secondary entrances? No loading dock, no personnel entrance-- Fences? covered in rave wires. - Electrified? - No. Why? If Sara can get herself back to motor pool, I think we can find a way inside. With all the different retrofits over the years, the fence line is widened. But security cameras remain exactly where they've always been. They've never accounted for the difference. - There's a blindspot. - Yeah. Right here. If Sara can get back to that spot, we can breach the fence. It's risky, Michael. That's all we've got. How much time to tell Sara where we going to meet her? How? We get no visitations, no phone calls. It's clean. Take it to Tancredi. Remember when I taught you about flowers? I wish I was with you now. To see you holding one in your hand. To see you holding one in your hand. Tomorrow. PM. Seven. Oil dump. Sure looks like you've been busy. Do you have a warrant, Agent Wheatley? A warrant? No, I don't need one. My testimony would be that your brother let me in. Once inside, saw all this evidence, right in plain sight. What judge is gonna take your word over mine? What evidence? Those pictures were taken from public property. That prison, was paid for by the taxpayers. So all you have evidence of, is an exonerated citizen, standing on a public road, taking pictures of a public building. Last I checked, it's not a crime. What if I said that I could get you on attempt, just for having all this stuff? What if I told you that all this was peace offering? The warden won't let me see my wife. So I figured, if I found a few lapses in the security, pointed them out as a gesture of good faith, she might change her mind? Is that so? Find anything yet? No. Looks airtight. Well thank goodness for that. You guys will let me know if anything comes up, right? You'll be the first to know. On the outside, I was known for getting the job done. No matter what. I got paid well for it. Now I'm broke. But I still need things. - Like what? - A favor. I don't do favors for cons. Really? It's not what it says on the bathroom wall. As I understand, you'd do favors for those who reciprocate. Is that true? This is bullshit, Boss! I'm a veteran around here. Ain't no reason to toss me! You-- Hey! You low leaf! Looky, looky here. No! That brown ain't mine, boss. You know this! I don't do no drugs! Who put that in here?! You... ugh! Get your hands off me. I know where the hole is. What y'all looking at? I do no drugs! Somebody is going down there! I love you too. Sofia's making arrangements in Central America. Once we break Sara, we're on the boat, we're gone. - Hey. - It's Lou. Just got the decision from the court. They're ordering the warden to allow a supervised visitation. - Where are you going? - They're letting me see Sara. Pera, pera, pera, pera-- If they're going to be listening to every word you say, you gotta be careful about this. If she understood my letters, she'll find a way to tell me. How? She's going to blink the Morse code? Attention, inmates... Visiting hours will be over in five minutes. Oh my God! Oh my God! Who did this to you? I'm okay. Baby's okay. Sara, I'm so sorry. You're in here because of me. I'm sorry. This is hard. - I miss you so much - No touching! I miss you too. You just have to hang in there, okay? I'm trying. But my protection's gone. - Did you get my letter? - I did. I know sometimes it's hard for me to express what I want to say. But I hope you understood... what I meant to tell you. I did. Is he getting cute? You were there for me. And I will be there for you. - Okay. - Alright, that's it. Time's up. See you soon. Bye. Michael. I was thinking a lot. About the photos and the mock-up that you showed me at the loft. And I ran a few tests. Lo and behold, I've found a blindspot. Right along the fence line over here, due to our retrofit. You didn't know about this, did you? No, no, of course not. Because you would've told me or the warden about it if you did, right? Well, it's a good thing I found this when I did, before anyone tried to escape. Well if we can't go through the fence, then that leaves under or over. Look, how's she gonna climb that fence without being seen, huh? I'm guessing there's no telephone wire for her to climb across. - Then she's gotta go under. - Alright, let's get some shovels-- What was that you were saying about parachutes? Parachutes-- Guys, come on. You can't be-- Parachutes? Couple of thoughts on that. A: We don't have a plane, B: We don't have a pilot. Have you ever worn a parachute? Don't worry. I think I've got a plan. But we're gonna need some help from an old friend. Who? - You want a favor from me. - Just hear me out. Of course. I mean... When you and Michael send me back to that prison, you did give me a piece of chewing gum. I mean what kind of man would I be if I didn't quit your pro-quote. Look, all you gotta do is sound off the fire alarm, in here, tomorrow night at 7:30. That's it. You're breaking her out. Krantz has put a hit on her. That's our one shot, of keeping her alive. Well you're on a pivoted kind of damn, Lincoln. We'll put five grand on your cake once this whole thing jumps off. The love of Michael's life is only worth $5,000? That's the best we can do. - I need six figures. - That's all we got. Well, like a day for you, I know somebody who does... the General's man. He's got to pay out for Sara's hit. You wire that money to me by 7 PM tomorrow, and we're in business. What's his name? It's your brother to you that agony is. Come on, you gotta give me more than that. Tomorrow. 7 PM. Go on, fetch. You should have seen the look on Michael's face. When he saw me fixing that fence and installing that camera. You did a great job. Job's over now. If Michael has this misguided belief that Sara's life is in danger, he's gonna find a way back into that prison. Your job will be over until you give us enough evidence to put him back behind bars. So what's the latest? There's nothing concrete. But I'll let you know when I get something. Alright. Good man. I warned you. Tough going alone. I know he's breaking you out. I'm coming with you. Relax. Krantz sent me to kill you, but after what he's put me through, I'm done taking orders from him. You're sitting next to me at the mess when I was poisoned. You'd think you would've lasted this long if I wanted you dead? I want you dead. You're still alive. Do you think it's hard to stay alive when you know who's coming after you? There's 200 women in this prison. Could you even get to Gen Pop? I'm coming with you. Or nobody's going. Well, if you're watching this, I'm glad. Because that means you're safe. How does he think he's gonna do this, bro? He's going to jump out of a plane. I know he's gonna jump. The question is, can he land? Not without getting caught. And how is he going to get out of the cell block, even if T-Bag-- It's a big "if". Trusting T-Bag is... crazy. Michael, we, uh... We really have to re-think this. I have. And there's no other way. Okay. I'm going to drop down into this outer area here. And I'll cut the parachute off before anyone can reach me. They're going to be right on your ass. I can hide behind this building, wait for a window. Then I'll make my way over here. That's the chapel. Well hopefully, uh... Sara will be waiting. Why the chapel? During the riot in '88, prison employees escaped through the administration building. They wound up here, outside the fence. The administration building, is connected to the chapel. Which means that somewhere in that compound, there is a subterranean exit. If we can get through it, you can meet us there. How's Sara gonna get to the chapel? She'll have to find a way. Look, we're doing this at 7 PM tonight, just like we've planned. - Where have you been? - What did I miss? I need you to find a plane and a pilot. I need you two, to take care of T-Bag. Find out exactly who has this money, and where they're keeping it. - And then we have to get it. - By 7 PM tonight. Or Sara's going to die in there. Is everybody onboard? Okay. Tell me, you've completed your assignment. Well, I got the cash. But there'll may be some delay in final delivery. The woman we hired is having trouble getting near Sara Tancredi. Then hire somebody else. Call it open season. Put a bounty on her head. I don't care how you do it. I want Sara Tancredi dead by the end of the day. Open cell! One hour! Yo, we about to play cards. Do you want in? I'm okay. Thanks. You should. With Daddy gone, you're gonna need your backup. Hell, we all did. I've got, uh... a pre-natal thing. It's cool. Thanks. Not too smart though, for a girl with a bounty on her head. Aren't you heard? Tancredi, you have a visitor. Say hello to your husband for me. What's wrong? Look, um... I know you don't have any control over what's happened here, but uh... Things aren't working out. Okay. I'm trying to find a way to... To do... this. But from where we're standing right now, there's only one option. Do you need more time... to think? No. No, it's not about that. I've made up my mind. 'Cause there's nothing you could do about it. Except... pray for us tonight. Pray for us? You can pray for us to be together. Maybe I'll do the same. How can I rob someone if I've no clue who he is? The logbook outside says that Krantz had one visitor yesterday. A Joe Daniels. Well if he was in the power deduction, I'd say, Daniels is your bagman. You know how many Daniels live in Miami? Thousands. I need more. Well you better get crackin', 'cause if I ain't get that money by 7 o'clock, you ain't got your fire, you ain't got your fire alarm. And that means Pretty ain't got his Mrs. Pretty. Listen, my friend, you're in no position to makin' demands... Okay, shh-- I ain't talking about backing out the deal. I put my ear on the ground and come up with some details. Good. And now, fetch. We got a pilot. There's a guy I'd busted 20 years ago, running drugs across the Gulf. Went legit. Runs a charter business now. He must've jumped out of a few planes, huh? Yes, several. Some for sport. Some necessity. It's a big difference, Michael. It's not easy hitting the X, especially at night. Don't worry. I can go alone. - What do you got? - It's a test. See, the prison was built in the mid-80's, so that exit in the administration building is probably protected by an electronic code of lock, modified by a security card. Those locks don't have power protection, which means you can override them. Then you can't just go to the building, shut it, or blow it out? No. set off the other alarms. Not to mention that it'll kill you. That's why we have to find another way. Yeah. Yeah. Talk to me, Mahone. What have you got? Nothing yet. I don't need updates on the hour. I need evidence, intent. It's not crap. Call me when he's in the process of committing a crime. Yeah. I'm not going to let him walk away from me like he did from you. It's going down if I've got to shoot him in the back. Sorry. Time for you to get paid now, bitch. Are we friends now? Get out of the way! What happened here?! I didn't see anything, sir. - Move! - Me neither. Bad news. Agatha Warren is dead. - Who did that? - No one's talking. But I hear it says fish. Tancredi and Morgan. No! No! There he is. If you don't like this guy, we can still find someone else. Good to see you, Sni. What you get into here, Mahone? Jumping at 1500 feet ain't going to be easy. You've gone back on your word already? Let's not forget who's doing who a favor here. Favor? Favor that I bust your old lady for traficking. No, I did not. If anyone asks, I was flying tourists to the Keys, and it's not my fault they jumped. Sounds good to me. If you don't like this guy, we'd take a day. - We come up with a new plan. - No, there's no time, Alex. - It's not just Sara's life at risk. - I understand that. I know you do. That's why I also know I can ask for your help. - Yeah. What do you need? - If I don't make it... I want you to make sure Sara and my brother get out of the country alive. I need to know they're gonna be okay. And I'm gonna trust that you'll do everything you can to make that happen. Take this. I trust you, Alex. Remember that. Special delivery. - What is it? - I don't exactly know. It came via messenger from uh... the lady side. "My man on the outside needs to know who to call for the birthday present." Whose birthday is it? Well, just see to it that it gets back to the same place. Will do. So this is Joe Daniels' number, right? That's it. Is that enough information, or you need a social security number too? - That'll do. - Remember-- I want that money wired to the account number specified. No wire, no fire. You boys do me wrong, I have no qualms at all about singing it loud and clear, you understand? You know what? Just be ready. That was Sofia. She'll meet you in the San Andreas Harbor in Dominican Republic and then - you guys can fly to Costa Rica. - Cool. I know where Daniels is. And after we rob him, I'll take the money to Quik Green and, uh... wire to the bank. You're gonna meet us at the airstrip, right? Might give a shot now. Okay. This is it. We're ready. Thanks, buddy. For everything. Good luck, papi. See you on the other side. Nobody's talking, huh? Girl's dead. No one's said any? I made it in the woodshop. Want to give my daughter Emily a birthday gift on her actual birthday. So I need to get out of here. It's funny. - You're never sentimental. - Oh, I'm not. It's just for her. We need to get to the chapel. We? There's no way out of here, right now. I'm gonna need you. Yeah? Mr. Daniels, American Paint Company, here for the job. Well, this is Mr. Daniels, but I didn't order any painters. It's Wednesday, sir. I believe you did. Hold it right there. I'm calling the police. Get out! This is it. I'll be right back. Gotta get that parachute. Michael! Come here. There's a better way. Mess! Mess, half hour. Little faster. We don't have all day. Let's go! Got any ideas? Yeah. Keep your head down and follow me. I'll think of something. You better think of something fast, 'cause we have company. I hope you're ready for a fight, princess. This one's to the death. Do you think you can overpower her? Yeah. I don't think it's her you have to worry about. Just be ready. - Hello? - It's me. I got the message about the birthday present? Was the gift earned? What in the hell are you talking about? - The birthday present. - Birthday present? Two guys showed up at my house, they took the money and they beat the crap out of me. Howdy, General. I just thought of let you know how I came in with some green. My personal preference is two Zegna bars and a copy of the Times. So I see you in the AEM? You worthless son of a whore. Go to hell! Careful I don't get there first. Lest I become king of that prison, too. Alright, from takeoff, the prison's gonna come up real fast. So whatever you gotta do to get ready, do it now. You got it. We've got the money. Sucre's just dropped me off on the way to wire it. Good. That means T-Bag's set. I'm goin' to see how long it's gonna take and we get going. You sure that thing's gonna hold you up? Yeah, it'll be fine. What about you? This is not my first time inside a prison. But hopefully... will be my last. Think about all the amazing stories you're gonna be able to tell your kid. You're gonna be the type of father our dad never was. Someone to look up to. Take care, Michael. Unless you've got details, I'm hanging up. And you can forget about getting your badge back. He's got a plane. He's got a parachute into the yard. - What? - Yeah, I swear to God, he's gonna be over prison airspace at 7 o'clock. Call in reinforcements. I want 20 armed COs in the yard. And be ready to turn off all exterior lights. Scofield won't see what's coming until it's too late. And bring me Sara Tancredi. Wait, wait. What do you think happened with Agatha, it's not what happened. I need to make this right with you, okay? Go ahead. I was hoping I'd see you here. You know I still owe you one big juicy favor. Later, blue eyes. I swear to God she wanted to kill me and I was just defending myself. - You remember that? - Yes, I do. My momma gave me that. Told me I was going to give it to one of my kids one day. Not only did I get knocked up, but the girl in the family... And I practically raised Agatha and she was no killer. Now I can say that much for myself. You didn't know what I had in mind yet. Okay, listen, you're right. Agatha isn't a killer. She was just a-- real bitch with a bit of more than she need to. Skittles. Okay. We cool. We cool. We cool, we-- whoa, whoa, whoa. Kaorla. She wants you to bring Tancredi to her office. A'ight? Okay. Son of a bitch! They'll be coming right through here, okay? Federal agent Todd Wheatley. I need to get inside right now. Emergency team takes priority, sir. I'm the leader of the emergency team. Now let me inside. - Sorry. Strict orders. - Go talk to your supervisor. Come on! No weapons! Let the suburban through. The plane should be overhead any minute. Hey, fellas! Kill the lights. As soon as he hits the ground, I just want one of you to start firing. Standby. We're standing by. Easy now. Hold your fire. Standby! Now! Let's go. Move in, men! Where the hell's Scofield? Emergency team takes priority, sir. I'm the leader of the emergency team. Now let me inside right now. I've strict orders. No one gets inside at this point, sir. I don't care what your orders are. Go talk to your supervisor. Why isn't Tancredi in front of me right now? We've just got the situation under control. We're looking for her right now. Oh my God! - Are you alright? - Yeah. It was Morgan. Check the kitchen. They might be in the kitchen. I'm not gonna make it on my own. Either leave me with tools here or make up your damn mind. Are you gonna be able to make it? Yeah. Okay. It's now. Alright, hold up. Nah, I think we're good. Don't move! - Stand on the dark, now! - Please, I just... On the ground! You're here alone? Damn it, con. When I ask you a question, you answer. Is there anyone else here? Yes. Who? - God. - Excuse me? He's always here. I was worried about my little girl on the outside. So I came to pray. See if someone would watch over her. Go check it out. The stove mess is open. Need support right now! I've got to get these animals locked down! We better head over there. I hope that daughter of yours - is hell a lot smarter than you. - So do I. Hey. Are you ready to go? Nobody gets in or out of this prison. I don't care if it's the President having to take a piss, you tell him to turn the hell around. Get a team. I want every inch of that fence line checked for points of compromise. Yes, sir. Michael said this is where they're gonna come out. You think Sucre made the drop on time? I don't know. No, no, no. Please enter your account number. Your account balance is zero dollars and zero cents. If you would like to access another account-- Your account balance is zero dollars and zero cents. What the hell you thinking you're doing, fish? We're in lockdown. What for? Something's going on in bitch block. I don't know. What's it worth to you to find out? We're going to get through here? On the other side is a kind of an escape hatch for the administrators. In case of a riot. If this is the same system they have in Fox River, that door can only be open remotely from the Central Control. That's why we've gone and ask for help. T-Bag. Tell them what you told me. Michael Scofield is about to stage a prison break. And I know exactly how he's gonna do it. Exactly what did Scofield asked you to do? Just light a fire in my cell. And the rest... The rest will just take care of itself. A fire alarm. If that goes off, what's your protocol? State law, mandatory evac. Hell, he won't go break, I was goin' to get you to escort her out. - Shut up! - Get him outta here. Alright, the evacuation's only going to get him out in the yard. Whatever he's up to, he needs noise and he needs chaos. Deactivate the smoke detection system, the fire alarm, and while you're at it, kill the horn. If anybody so much as bends a blade of grass in this place, I want him to be able to hear it. - What are we waiting for? - We made a deal. With the right price, T-Bag will set off the fire alarms. That's what we're waiting for. - Michael, there's a-- - It's okay. See, there's only one thing you can count on when you're dealing with T-Bag. He's a rat. Anything? So far, just a female inmate loose in the yard. - Tancredi? - No, Morgan. First name, Gretchen. - Over by the chapel. - Alright. Alright. Great. Let's go. Okay, down there. Okay. Beyond this door should be a hundred yards of tunnel. On the other end of that is Linc, and after that, there's a boat mounted for white sands and blue water. A power surge to the system, will override the reader, for just a few seconds. Just long enough for you to open that, so get ready. One more time. I was afraid this might happen. It's okay. It's alright. We're going to keep moving and we're gonna find another way out of here. I know what I have to do. I need units to the chapel. Now! - Where are they? - I don't know. They should've been here by now. The battery wasn't generating enough power. We have to blow the system for the whole building. Okay. What do you want to try? This is the main fuse. If I yanked that, everything will go dark for a second. I reconnect these two cables... If I reconnect these two cables, there'll be a lot of noise, every light bulb in this place is going to blow. As soon as that happens, you need to open that hatch. And I want you to start running. Okay. What about you? Michael? Sara... Someone has to stay here, and someone has to open the hatch. And that someone's gotta be you. Okay. So I'll leave it open for you. You don't understand. This is the only way. I'm not leaving unless you're coming with me. But I am coming with you. I love you. God, I love you too. Go! Go, Sara. Go. Downstairs. Where's Michael? Sara, where is he? Where's Michael? Where is he? He's not coming back. He's not coming back. What do you mean, he's not coming back? What do you mean by that? He's not coming back. He'll be here. He's gone, Lincoln. Linc, we gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. Hey, I'll be over there in a minute. Why am I being punished?! I'm the guy through the window! You aided and abetted an escape, Mr. Bagwell. And as far as the authorities are concerned, you're an accomplice. Scofield! Scofield! Scofield! Michael asked me to give you this, if he didn't make it out. He said it would help you understand why he did what he did. It's his bloodwork. This is the General's money. I was supposed to wire it down to Costa Rica for you to pick up but uh... I ran into some trouble. I'm sorry. You take care of that baby, okay? You take care yours. This is for you. He never said anything to me. Why didn't he just tell me? 'Cause he knew you'll try to stop him. He knew you'd do anything to protect your family. But I didn't. Well... You will soon. Take it easy. Sara. Thank you. Yeah. Well, if you're watching this, I'm glad. Because that means you're safe. And that's all I ever wanted. I wish I could... be there with you. But as you probably know now, I wouldn't have much time anyway, so... I made my choice, and-- I don't regret it. Anyway, not too long from now, there's going to be another little Scofield running around. And Linc, I want you to promise me, no matter what, they're going to grow up knowing their uncle is never far away. And Sara, I want you to promise me that you're gonna keep an eye on Linc. As you may have noticed, he has the tendency to get in trouble. You know we spend so much of our lives, not saying the things we want to say. The things we should say. We speak in code, we send little messages. Origami. So now, plainly, simply, I want to say that I love you both. Very much. And I want you to promise me, that you're gonna tell my child, that you're gonna tell my child how much they're loved every day. and remind them how lucky they are... To be free. Because we are. We're free now. Finally. We're free.
