Do you have any more fragile in there? - No, senora. - No? - No, that's the last of it. - Okay. Goes right through to the back on the left. Second door. Thanks. You guys want a pop? No, thanks. You can leave that right in the middle there. Careful, it's fragile. Morning, Sheriff. You have no right to arrest illegal immigrants. The law is the law. Any of you have a badge? Okay, los bajo. You may not speak to illegals. You may not touch them, you may not point any kind of weapon at them. And you absolutely may not fire on them. All you're allowed to do is alert the Border Patrol. You can't break the law to enforce the law. I could arrest every single one of you. - Get some water for these fellas. - Yes, sir. And break this camp down. Now! You got half an hour to pack this up and get out of here. Morning, sir. How are you? I'm so happy to be with you today, my son. - Thank you for coming. - You are very welcome. You have taken the first step. And you are ready to go. Remember, redemption is always possible for the man who desires it, my brother. Now I know that you can control your anger and your hatred. I wanted to give you this. It won't work miracles, however, it can help you see better when it is dark. Thank you. And I want you to have this. This is the crescent. It means "light in the midst of the darkness." As you had your difficult days, you will have your bright days, God willing, yet to come. You have done your time. You are going to be a free man. Don't ever be afraid of your new life. Here, this is for you. Okay, you will take care now. Take care. Thank you. Agent Smith. Supervisor Jones is expecting me. - Ah. - Supervisor Jones? Please, call me Paul. Right this way. So why New Mexico? Well, it's warm, dry. Peace and quiet. Ooh, I hope you find it. What, 360 days of sun, are you kidding? Please, this way. Here's your office. Maria Perez, Emily Smith. Oh, pleased to meet you, Maria. Hi. So, what kind of reinsertion program do you guys have here? I don't have the staff, money, or time to be a social worker. Here's your badge, car keys. There are your case files. First one's in there, have fun. Thanks. Richard Wayne? Please. I'm Agent Smith and I'll be taking care of you from now on. After you, sir. So we're not going to cause each other any problems then, are we, Richard, hmm? No, ma'am. You're not going to have any problems with me. Just look at me. I'm going to be dead soon, anyway. No. I got no urges. I couldn't get it up even if I tried. So why... So... So why can't I spend my last year of parole in Ohio? What's in Ohio? My family. That's all I'm asking for. I told that to the other guy before he quit. He couldn't care less. Hmm. Well, I appreciate your situation, Mr. Wayne. I'll see what I can do. Thanks, Miss Smith. Thank you very much. Now you take care of yourself. Don't believe a word that comes out of that old perv's mouth. Well, where's the harm in sending him to Ohio? - All clear. - He's all clear. Open it up. Mr. Garnett? I'm Emily Smith, your parole officer. I'm here to transport you to your post-release orientation. Check. 2,800 for the work you did while serving your time, and $200 in gate money. - You're ready to roll? - Yes. Congratulations on your release. Thanks. I'm sorry. 2nd WOMAN: Or you're going to go back to jail! That's it. Here's a swab. Take a seat, sir. So you've had five incarcerations. First conviction, age 11. Three more as a minor. You served 18 years of a 21-year sentence for killing a sheriff's deputy at the Mexican border. Your mother, adoptive mother, lives... lives in Eddy County, New Mexico. When was the last time you had contact with her? My plate is full. Answer the question, sir. When did she last visit you in jail? She didn't. During your three years of parole, you may not leave Luna County without written permission. You may not be in possession of a weapon of any kind. Now, here is a list... Can you read, sir? This is a list of what qualifies as a weapon. You may not have contact with any known criminals, or any former criminal associates. You recognize this guy, Terence Saldano? Yes. Stay away from him. Curfew. You may not leave your place of residence between 9 P.M. and 6 A.M. without permission. I'm also authorized to randomly inspect your bank account and paycheck stubs. Let's get you to your accommodation. Mr. Garnett. You have been given a second chance at life. Take advantage of it. But let me remind you that one bad choice, even a little one, I'm going to put you back inside for those remaining three years. I hope you won't make me do that. I won't. Trust me. Oh, trust, sir, is something you're going to have to earn. Here we are. It's at the top of those stairs. And Garnett? - Yeah? - Get yourself a job. Hey, Salvador! Thanks. This one's more affordable. Like it? Employment Office, this is Jane. - You have a criminal record. - Yes. That doesn't leave us with too many options. How many men do you need? All right. They need help on a farm near the border. Minimum wage, no benefits. It's okay. I'll take it. Here's the application and the address of the farm. Thanks. Parole officers work for the state, not for the county or the sheriffs. - What are we doing here? - Let's face it. Garnett did kill one of his deputies. It'd make him feel better for him to meet you. - That was Agati's deputy? - Yep. He was sheriff 20 years ago? Yep, been re-elected five times. Welcome. Bill Agati. - Emily Smith, pleasure to meet you. - Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Jones. Why have you been such a stranger? Sit down, please. So I understand you're the parole officer for William Garnett. I am, sir, that's right. You've got your hands full trying to keep tabs on our friend. So I've been advised. Good, then, we're on the same page. He's a loose cannon. Now, with all due respect, Sheriff, Garnett was a model prisoner. Earned his G.E.D. and tutored other inmates towards theirs. You know he converted to Islam. Yeah, I'm aware of all that. But for the time being, I'm more concerned with earthly matters. I want to make myself very clear. Garnett represents a danger to this community. And I have a responsibility to alert the people that a convicted cop killer and known drug dealer is back among them. You really think that's called for? Look, we both know what's in this report. Now we need to talk about what's not in it. No, I really don't think that'll be necessary, Sheriff. I know what I have to do. - Do you? - Absolutely. Listen, I appreciate your concern, Bill, I do. But I've developed a certain philosophy over the years that's proved pretty effective. And what exactly is that philosophy, Miss Smith? Trust. Without trust, there can be no chance of reform for anybody. Well then, if you decide you need my help, don't hesitate to call. And... thank you for stopping by. Thank you, Sheriff. Look, I know my wife would love to meet you. We're going to be having a celebration for a local hero just returned from Afghanistan. Why don't you and Jones come by? Well, thank you. Look forward to it. Okay, then. Have a wonderful day. Thank you, Sheriff. Enjoy the view. Yah! Go! You're a cultured guy now? Sheriff. Sharia law? Jesus didn't do it for you? So, what do we call you now? Just chosen a new way of life, that's all. Mm. So, what's your next caper? Live in peace. Start a family. Live in a little house with a little lawn and a lawnmower. Wife, kids, neighbors. A fairy tale if I've ever heard one. Look, I'm on parole, so... nobody's going to listen to me if I make a complaint. But I want to ask you... could you not harass me? The world's turned upside down. Still, it's good to see you showing some respect for the law... for once. All I'm looking for is a simple life, that's all. If you don't mind, I'd like to finish my dinner in peace. Thank you. My deputy, he's dead. After he met you, there was no more dinner for him. His little girl never had dinner with him. The legal system is wrong. Eighteen years in prison? I'd say you got away cheap. Sorry about Sergeant Taylor. Really, I am. I'm sure you are. Welcome home, Willie. Excuse me. Oh, hi, honey. I ran into Garnett tonight. What's he look like? He lost some weight. Good morning. Have a seat, please. Hey. Thank you. What can I do for you? - I'd like to open an account. - Sure. What type of account do you need? Checking. I will need your I.D., please. Here you go. Thank you. I need your name and your signature here. Here's five temporary checks. That should be everything you need. I'm still trying to figure out everything I need. But... I'll take the checks. If you need something else, here's my card. - Teresa. - Mm. Teresa Flores. - Adios. - Thank you. Yes? Something else? Huh? Because I'm definitely going to call you. William Garnett. Right here. Go all the way from there. - I was going to give you a call. - Yeah? Yeah. I got a job. Good for you. Where? The ranch. I got my work contract. Good. Telephone number, too. Great. Anything else? Yeah, I... opened up a banking account. Put in $1000. That's the account number right there. That's it? I got a date. For next Sunday. A date? What, with a girl? You're joking, right? You sure are a fast worker, Mr. Garnett. Where'd you meet her? At the bank, where she works. At the bank? Why? That a problem? No, not if you told her about your past. What, you think I'm going to get her to pull a job for me or something? Did you tell her you'd been to prison and why? I was in a bank to open up an account. I met a woman there. I liked her. She could've been anybody. She could've been working anywhere. She could've been working on the cow ranch. She could've been shoveling cow shit. All I'm trying to do is what you asked me to do. I'm just trying to live a normal life like anybody else. Is that all right with you? Can you let me do that? Just hold it right there, not another step. All right. All right, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry about that. Who's scared? Huh? Now, you sit down. I said sit down. Mr. Garnett, there is a line that must not be crossed. Do you understand me? Do you? Yeah. Good. Tell her the truth. What brought you to Deming? You just opened a bank account. Okay. See, I spent a lot of time here. It's just... I just... been away for a while, that's all. And? Where did you go? Different... Mm-hmm. What's up? - What's up? - Willie! Good to see you. - Good. Looking good, man. - I'm good, yeah. I see you still balling. All right. Well, you look all right, man. Yeah, I've been waiting 18 years for you to get out. You never got my letters. You never responded. You know, I'm still broken-hearted about that. Yeah, I was just trying to get a new life. I mean, I love you, man, but... Seriously, I mean, I can't see you. I can't even be around you, they can put me back in for three years. I got to go. All right. It was good to see you. Can I get a beer and a ginger ale, please? He don't want to talk to me? We're out of that. Just a bottle of water, then. Hey, there's no law that says you can't run into people. I've been looking for you for two days. I got to talk to you about something, brother. - No podemos. - Como? If I'm going to make it, I'm going to have to stay out of all this, all right? I got something for you. No necesito nada. Nada. All right? I'm telling you, man, you look good. It's good to see you. Take care of yourself, all right? - Take care of yourself. - Wait, wait, wait. You mean I got to beg to talk to you? Gary. Gary. Shut the fuck up, okay? Just shut the fuck up. Hey, my card. How can I reach you? I got your number, all right? Why you piss him off? Don't fucking do that again. Hey. Let's get out of here and go somewhere private. Si. Another one, please. Gary, I'm going to go dance. Stay, Gary. I had a really nice time. Me too. Teresa, you know, there's something I need to talk to you about. Just wanted to tell you. You know I... I'm Muslim, you know. Well, all my family is Catholic. I guess it means I'm Catholic, too. But seriously, there is something that I need to talk to you about. You know what, you got to go. You got to leave. - What? - Leave. Bye. Vamos. Goodbye. This is not your business. It's not your business. Afternoon, ma'am! You mind taking your hands off my vehicle? A gentleman doesn't yell at women. Hey, Chris? Could you turn that down? Ain't none you, bro. I'm not asking you to turn it off, just down, please. What the fuck? Get the fuck out of my room! What the fuck are you doing with my TV? You Muslim nigger piece of shit. Fuck you! You're going to owe me a new TV, asshole! Fuck you! Did you fucking see that? Did you see that shit? He threw my fucking TV! You saw that, right? Goddamn it! Son of a bitch! Fuck you, you owe me a new TV, asshole! Fuck off! Okay, you guys. Party's over. I'll deal with this. Back to your rooms. You hear me? You did this? Lost control, sorry. Step out into the hallway, sir. Back off. Turn around, face the wall. Put your hands behind your back. You can go back to your rooms. Shut the door. It's almost curfew. So this is what happens after, what is it, two weeks? I made a mistake. The sheriff came to Teresa's house today to humiliate me. Wait a minute. Agati came to Teresa's house? What for? I don't know. You got to ask him. Is there anything that I can do to fix this? Stay there. Don't move. Buy you another TV. Yeah, but the game starts in an hour. He's still an asshole. Well, Allah says that it's your lucky day. He's not pressing charges. Thanks to Allah. So here's the deal. You can either go back to jail, or you buy him a new TV. - $140? - Yep. Ha. Let that be a lesson. Garnett, go back to your girl and talk to her. Been 18 years since I really talked to a woman. Tell her that, too. Tell her everything. Thanks for coming. I spent 18 years in prison. I killed a sheriff's deputy. I've been away for half my life. 'An. I didn't know how to talk that well before I went in, and I don't know how to talk that well... Now that I'm out. I make these mistakes, you know, just a stupid mistake. Why am I here? I have a simple life. And I am fine with this. I like to stay in this way. I live 10 years in this country. I got myself a good job. I took out a loan and bought a small house. Maybe nothing is so unique about this. But I am happy- And I intend to keep it this way. Excuse me. Could you bring us two cups of water, please? - Yes. - Thank you. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. And to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. My friends, we are here today to celebrate the return of a local hero. - All right. - Yeah. Lieutenant Joe Corrales, United States Army, was awarded the Bronze Star for valor for actions taken while under enemy fire in Afghanistan. Joe, your community, and your country are proud of you. You epitomize the American spirit. And its willingness to defend and sacrifice to safeguard those principles upon which she was founded, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I am proud to stand here with you today, and your family and friends, and the citizens of Luna County, to say, "Welcome home." Thank you for your service. Okay, it's celebration time. Enjoy. Everyone. Now to get everybody plenty of food, plenty of drink. Nice to meet you. - Hello. - Oh, hey, Sheriff. Glad you made it. Emily Smith, my wife, Sheryl. - Oh, very pleased to meet you. - You too. Welcome. - Beautiful party. - Nice to see you here. Thank you. Could I have a word, Sheriff? - Please? - Sure. It's about William Garnett. I'd like to be notified the next time the sheriff's office is going to intervene. Intervene? Poor choice of words. We can do our jobs, Sheriff, without resorting to harassment and humiliation. None of that has happened. Garnett is trying really hard, but if he feels cornered, he's going to get in trouble again. And surely, that's not what we want, do we, Sheriff Agati? It's a party. Have fun. You went on a field trip? Where to? Sears Tower? You go to the top? Some trip. No, I'm just sitting on the porch having a beer, looking at the stars. It's so beautiful, Dad. Really beautiful. Little late for you to be calling. Okay. All right, Dad. Night. Mr. Garnett, congratulations, you passed the whiz quiz. You're free to go. Oh, Ms. Smith? Can I... You got a problem? No. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Want to step outside? Thank you. So, what's on your mind? Teresa wants me to move in with her, and I do. Is that okay with you? Don't you think that's a little hasty? No, I don't. That's a great machine. Oh, you ride? Well, maybe I do. Yeah, you do. Here. Write down her address. I need to inspect her house. No problem. No problem at all. Oh, and you're kicking that. You know what you're doing, huh? You ride a bike, huh? Yeah. Mind how you go on that thing. You have a nice day. Hey, Mr. Wayne. I've spoken to my supervisor. It's not good news, I'm afraid. You're going to have to spend your last year of probation here in New Mexico. I'm sorry. What? After that, you can go anywhere you want to. But you promised me. No. No, I said I'd look into it and I did. I only asked to die next to my family. Mr. Wayne, it is not my call. I'm sorry. Then you did nothing. I really tried. Fucking nothing. Hey. You know them? No. Ditch her. We can hang it... there? Si. Mr. Garnett! Hey! How's it going? I guess it's time for the job report. I didn't get the message. But there's about 1,700 cows here. I work with about 200 of them. I don't know all their names yet, but I feed them, water them, clean up their crap. Not a lot of money. - Well, it's a job, right? - Yeah, it's a job. And I'm out in the open air. How's your family? I've told you before, Garnett, no personal questions. Off limits. Yeah, well, since my personal business is your business, I guess I want to thank you. For your advice. Well, you're welcome. There it is, right? There it is. So... if you got anything, I got to... No, you're good. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Tell Terence I'm here. Mira, Willie... Anchor-baby, business is booming. Fucking wetbacks, man, they pay me 7Gs just so that the little ones can be born on this side. Then shazaam, the whole Beaner family gets to come over and stay. We throw in a free car seat, a free gift for mamacita, goddamn, I love being an American. I owe it all to you, Willie. You could've been a punk ass, you could've ratted us out. Ed, Fred, and me. But you stood by your family. And I owe you. That's what I came here to tell you. I need you to know, Terence, you don't owe me nothing. Willie, you spent 18 years of your life living in total darkness. I'm willing to offer you a lifetime of sunshine. Willie, you're not made for cleaning shit. And the sheriff, man, he got you in his sight. He ain't never going to forgive you for taking down his boy. Not until you're dead. You know how he rolls. You know what I'm going to do? I want to send you to a safe place, Mexico. Down there you'd be free. You don't have to worry about looking over your shoulder all the time. Thanks for your concern, but it's not necessary. I got a whole new path, a whole new life. You know, this... this new generation, they have no code of honor, no sense of responsibility. Willie, my people in Mexico, they're stealing from me. I need you to go down there and lay down the law. Put those bitches in their places like you did that deputy. They're going to be scared shitless of you. Besides Allah, she's everything to me. Allah? Allah? What are you talking about, Allah? What is Allah going to do for you? - You're not listening to me. - I'm your family, Willie. - You're not listening to me. - I'm your family. Okay, okay. No, no, no. Look, look, Willie. Look, I didn't mean to raise my voice. If you stay here, they're going to hold you on a leash for the next three years. And you know that sheriff, he's going to try to do whatever he can to send you back to prison. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? I'm only going to say this to you one more time. Stay away. Probably got lost or their smuggler left them here. - Mm-hmm. - Coyote got the kid. And that drag mark... it was a baby. Horrible. God damn it. What's it going to take? Sheriff! Guess what, boss? Your boy, Garnett, he went over to see Terence. - Good. - You want to pick him up? Parole violation, another three years. Unh-unh. Let him enjoy his little reunion tour. Morning, Joe. - How we doing today? - Just fine, Sheriff. How about yourself? - All is well, my friend. - Good. - Things running smoothly? - Oh, yeah. What... what brings you out this way? Just stopping by- How's our new friend doing? No complaints. Mm-hmm. Ain't it something though? A guy kills a deputy. And 18 years later, here he is, out in the sun like it never happened. Yeah. Well... what are you going to do, huh? If it were me... I'd do whatever I had to do to keep the piece of shit away from our kids, our families. I wouldn't be laying down no red carpet for him, that's for sure. That ain't holy water he's sweating there, Joe. I'd kick his ass out of town altogether. Know what I mean? Yes, sir. It's your home. It's our home. I'll check back. Say hi to your family. Go. Go. Hey... can I see you in my office? Don't bother. I know what you're going to say. It's okay if I finish out the day? Yeah, sure. Thanks, thanks. Why are you wrecking everything that Garnett is trying to do? Nice to see you, Emily. - Can I offer you a drink'? - No. - Maybe a Scotch this time. - This is not a social call. I never would've known. Why'd you get him fired, huh? He's broken no laws. None. You're letting your paranoia run away with you, Sheriff. Whoa. Back the truck up. We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto. You understand me'? Maybe you haven't noticed. I don't just come into work, twiddle my thumbs, and wait for something bad to happen. You get the message? The state granted him parole. The state did. I didn't. Well, that's not your prerogative, Sheriff. And it's my job to uphold that decision and make those 18 years count for something. Eighteen years? My deputy is still dead. Oh, go blow it out your ass. I offered you help, if you recall. But you turned it down. You said you could do it by yourself. So what do you do? You set him up by the border where he grew up running drugs, shooting at cops. Not the smartest thing I've ever seen, Agent Smith. So was getting him fired, Sheriff Agati. And if you continue to interfere with William Garnett, I'm going to file a complaint. Oh, phooey. You want to take that chance? I don't take chances, Agent Smith. I think you would've noticed that by this time. That's not all I've figured out, Sheriff Agati. Get out! You got something for me? This is what we have available today. We have something at the truck wash. I guess that's the only one I can do. Okay, go ahead, sign in. Mr. Wayne? You there? It's your parole officer. Richard. We're sorry, but the person you called has a voice-mail box that has not been set up yet. Goodbye. Willie, I need to see you. Come on, Willie. Willie, por favor, you really see yourself doing this? I couldn't even get you to do this when you were little. We used to pay kids on the block more money than this to clean our bikes. What about our sueno, our dream? Huh? What about that? You know, your god, Alang... - Allah. - Okay, Allah. He's messing with your head. Willie. Willie, we got so much more that we could do together. Look, just think it over. - Not for me. - Think it over. - Rashid? - Yeah? My shift's done. Take this over for me? It looks spotless. You're a pro. Willie! Willie! Aaah! Driver, slow down. Pull the bike over to the side of the road now. Okay, Garnett, let's get off the bike. Get off the bike. Get your hands up in the air. Step back towards my voice. You've done this before. Get on your knees. Go on. On your stomach. Hands to your side, palms down. Cross your legs. Going a little fast today, aren't we? Okay. On your knees. Come on. Get up. You got anything that's going to stick me today? Do you have anything that is going to stick me today? - No, sir. - Don't you eyeball me. Now, get up. Get up. Mind your head. Five-six, I have one in custody. Open one. Now, you are going to face the wall... until you hear that door close. Is that clear? Hey, is that clear? Yeah. Okay, Jones. Good night. Let him go in the morning. - I ain't going nowhere. - Just shut up. Have you listened to a word I've said? I've got to get you out of Luna County before the sheriff locks you up for good, but I can't just move you. I got to make a case you have family there who'll vouch for you, so I called your mother. - My mother? - Yeah, I talked to her. - You called my mother'? - I talked to her. She's expecting us. You don't know nothing about my mother. And what about Teresa? We're together now. What am I supposed to do about that? Teresa? Well, if she really cares for you, she'll follow you anywhere. That's how women are. Trust me. I know. Hey, Ma. I got that. You came from far away? - Deming. - Oh. You flew? No, Ma, it's not that far. We just drove. - Mrs. Garnett. - Hello. Beautiful place you have here. Thank you. Well, the lady was nice to drive you. Is that where you live now? Yeah, for now. I'm staying with my girlfriend. - I got a girlfriend now. - Oh. Yeah. I think you'd like her. I'd like you to meet her sometime. Hmm? - I had a scorpion in the house. - Did you? Yeah, but it was entirely my fault. I mean, I should've seen it sooner. Oh, you got him? Yeah. It was crawling all over the place. But you know, they're dangerous. Now I worry about what's crawling around when I'm... when I'm sleeping. You still doing that... you know, that Irish dancing thing you were doing? No, not so much anymore. Want something to drink? No, thanks. I'm fine, thanks. I would've cooked something for you, but it was such short notice. I said I'm fine, really. I didn't expect you to cook nothing for me anyway. Well... I mean, I wrote you all the time. Did you get any of my letters? Yes, I did. Did you read any of them? I mean, it would've been nice if you would've sent one to me. Why, Mom? Why what? Why didn't you come visit me once? Just once. Do you want money? - Because I can give you some. - Come on, Mom. - I don't have much. - Stop it! Stop it! I don't want any money. I don't want nothing. It's me. It's me, Ma. It's your son. I couldn't. What could I say? I didn't know what to say. What is it you want? I know that this is... It's got to be really difficult and uncomfortable for you. Me being here. You can't possibly know. Not easy for me either. Well, then, why are you here? Just tell me what you want from me. I don't want anything from you, Ma. I just... I just been wanting to tell you something. Will you listen to me? I'm sorry. I know that... that I made a lot of mistakes and did a lot of things wrong. And I know that you tried. But it's not your fault. I mean... it's not easy to raise a kid. And I know that I let you down. I'm really sorry for that. When the... when the judge read the sentence... I thought I was going to die. But I was relieved, too. I just couldn't... go back to all of that, Willie. I couldn't do it. It would kill me. That's why I didn't visit you. I got it, Ma. - He never mentioned me to you? - No. All right, there you are. What's going on? What? Teresa? Who did it? Terence. I'll fix this, all right? I'll be back. I'm going to fix this. Yeah, let's do it. Willie! Willie, no! Aah!
