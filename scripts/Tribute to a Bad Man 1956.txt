Nothing like a good drink to get in shape. - I missed you. - I love you too. Nasty things I said before I left. And I said them to you. Jo, when you and I are home alone ... ... and that door is closed... ... do not think about what happens outside. Will you go again? What I meant, I do not want to think about it . I'll try. Ho, ho, ho! So horse so! Do not be rushed! Id slowly! A good dressage takes time! Hey, stay there, eh! Up, up! Horse,... subject! Release the reins, Steve! Drop the reins! O no you do with them! What do you waiting for? Are you afraid of falling? Baldy! If the guy does not work to quit! Mr. Rodock is made fierce lately. No wonder. How long will follow looking for?

's What makes you, not think about it. How can you stay here? Listen, Steve. Do you think I do not care who has hanged a man? 've Come for you because I know you're hurting. It was horrible. Do not let it harden you. What you bitter. Jo. From the first night... I know. Do not expect to find a woman here. I did not dare to think of you. Mr. Rodock was a kind of God. I thought I should not think of you. He is no longer a God has hanged a man,... ... and now do think of you, Jo. I want to leave here. I want to make something of my life, but I will not go without you. Steve. 're So young. Remember what once told me. What you had dreamed. A place to live a normal life. 'd Completely insane if not fight for offering it. - Is he laughing at me? - No, not Steve. I'm going to do a single question. Please Steve, do not ask me . I have to go now. Jo. I love U. - You found the guy? - Yes And, how are you? Quiet? - Yes - Good. Jo. The horses are already tamed ... ... and the Wells Fargo come within a couple of days. We will give a party.

Right now I can not play! Get along, sir Rodock. Stop exhibirte. The horses have done everything. If these animals do know, I spit in the face. Steve, do not worry. Jo, I want to see you tonight. I have to talk to you. We have nothing to talk about, Steve. Jo... I... Jo! Look to see how Cooky with food. Rodock Lord. Would be very sad that the horses go out of style. That will never happen. What will happen when the railroad comes? The railway will not by large cities. That's what I said. What would big cities like New York and Chicago without horses? Exactly. Jo, please have to tell you something. Cooky, go to the kitchen and sees bringing the rest of the cakes. Yes, Miss Jo. Jo, listen. I do not know another way to put it. I love you, and I want to marry you . Steve. Do not even know where you come from, or what it was. I do not care. I think it should. I'm not the woman good for you as a wife. 'd Have a reason to do what you did. I had a reason. That was the easiest solution. I am a child of war, Steve. When I was 16, my whole family died . I came to New York, with very little money. Believing another country, another life... - Jo, I do not care what... - It was very hard for me. Was not prepared. If I could I have willpower ... ... I would have gone to work, like other girls. It was necessary to play the piano in a bar. I took my face and my body . Played piano for men... Then Jeremy found me. Gave me the chance to change their lives, and I accepted. Then discovered that he had fallen in love with him. But he... I know what you think all his men. 're Wrong. I know what you expected to hear. The feast is ready. Steve was helping me. Tell the men to come. So now is the guy. How do you mean? What did you think is this? A brothel? Nor I swallowed what McNulty! ? McNulty? What about McNulty? I saw you leave the barn, and was in here... ... in here with you! The night I got back from Cheyenne! Basta, Jeremy! McNulty meant nothing to me, and Steve means nothing! And now you! I known you were in Cheyenne, right?! I confessed last night, do you remember ! Remember! This party is better than the one given in Cheyenne,... ... Mr. Rodock. Until next summer, Mr. Rodock ! Come back soon! There will be more tame horses! When we run out women and money return. Wanted to put between them as far as possible Jocasta still wanted to But I could not stay there, knowing . she loved Mr. Rodock not know where I was going simply me away from them Where is Mr. Rodock ? Since last night, has not left the house. Miss Jo has asked for you. Rodock Lord! Rodock Lord. Rodock Lord! Mares and foals are not. The mares and foals! The stolen! - Where you've seen? - I have not seen it, but... ... gone all the valley. They've been taken. Found a pony with a broken leg. Do the foals and mares stolen ? - Did you see footprints? - Yes Maybe 2 or 3 days. - Tell the men to saddle. - Is only Abe. Then tell Abe that saddle! Not think back. Not want to see more hanged. But I had to come. Do not know why. Iba Road West. - I've been looking. - Abe told me so. I wanted to say goodbye. I'm going too. Are you going? Do not want to live here. Let me go with you. A Cheyenne to San Francisco, wherever you want. Let me be with you until... until... ... change your mind and marry me. I... I have to go with Mr. Rodock. No one will go with Abe. But... do not go back until . Please Jo. Right, Steve. I'll wait. Is there nothing we can do for him? No. Abe. Do it. We have fresh tracks. You were right, kid. From now, 2 or 3 days. But I do not understand how Colts took. With them you can not go fast. I did not know we were to make this. Okay. Well you know. If I'd known, I would have unaccompanied. When the die has left your hand and you can not change the fate. Apparently have a visitor. Hello Mac Hi Steve. How do you here? Rodock fired me. I'm Cheyenne. - How is Jo? - Still there. - So you have a job. - Yes, I have. This is not the way to Cheyenne. Mac, tell him I I can go anywhere. Sure, Steve, of course. As you let us go. Freeze. Desrmalos Steve. Abe, scrape out the horses. McNulty. I'll hang. Bind them, Steve. From hands and feet. Rodock Lord, and let Abe relocate to the strong Whitney. Obey. Quiescent, beautiful... still. You mutilated my mares. - The've left hoof. - What have you done? Nobody considers that a man... ... so would an animal. - Why did you do it? - I'll tell you what, Steve. If a horse is trimmed hooves... ... you can not walk. 's Like you nailed you a knife between the nails. He did not escape to. So mares would not move from here. foals would stay with them while having to suck . So these scoundrels, the scoundrels, have a good alibi.
