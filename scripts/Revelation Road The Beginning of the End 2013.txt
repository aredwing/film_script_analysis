Help here. - We do not need your charity. It is not charity, okay? A payment, because you taught me something. I thought I had changed, but I have not changed. You said that no power on earth a person can change. I'm beginning to believe it's true. Mama, I'm hungry. - Let's go, honey. I want to go home. Come on. It seems we always are looking for more. Go ahead. - Are you sure? That's what good neighbors, they take care of each other. Thank you. It seems that you have more days like that. I have no idea. Yes, it is difficult everywhere. It feels like the whole world falls apart if you ask me. Where have all the heroes gone? What happened to the Titans? They had the power in order to change the world. When I look around me, I only see children. Screaming to their mommies. They are still there, the precursors. I knew good men and fought with them. So you're a warrior? You do not look out. It makes me sick when I orders warriors see hiring measly males. Soon there will be a reckoning. If the Titans stand and the world back Taking the lawyers and politicians. What do you think? What you call a titan, I call a tyrant. Men without feeling. Men who kill and steal and call it their own. God willing there will always be men and I have to tyrants to indicate their place. Thanks, for small money. Beautiful, that I could see you. Area code Finally, someone worthy to fight. Shall I leave the room? Frank, what's that? - Quiet. Go there at Beth. Nothing. Lie. Marion, take this. Soon there is a settlement. - What have they done to you? People do not change. - Are you a G-man of the CIA? They even did not exist. There is no force on earth you can change from within. He said come with me, everyone that labor and are printed on and I will give you rest. Jesus is a bridge. Freedom, peace, your family. You try to reach but you can not. Jesus is the bridge. Jesus, can you help home. We go with me? Hello, I'm Rachel. Yes, I do. I want that. Josh come here, baby kicks.

You helped me back up. And that made sure we were partners. And the light keeps coming back. I can not run away. And now I can stop. Even I was so busy to run and fly, I ... I just want to come home. For good this time. This feels great. Rachel? Rachel, are you still there? What are they? - The northern lights? I do not think so. He is, that must be it. No. - Jesus. Josh McManus, come with me.

Are you ... I mean ... Are you him? While declining ms Beth then think about what you saw today. I do not know what I saw. My grandparents, they ... What happened to them? - What do you think happened? The light came down and took them. And what is the light? - I do not know God? Why he has not taken me? - Have you ever asked him to do that? Why you telling me all this? - I'm not special? That's where you're wrong, Elisabeth. Every person has his role in God's plan. Billions flow drops by the river of time. However, there are certain people choose which God himself. In order to lead. The current in a different direction You Elisabeth you have a very important role in the plan of God. I just never asked.
