Right. - Well... maybe one of these days we'll actually defend somebody who's really innocent. - A man is innocent until proven guilty. - Until proven guilty. Look, you and I both know that son of a bitch killed 14 people in cold blood. - I just hope there's nothing to this karma thing. - Oh, please. - Ah, come on. What the hell? And I don't want to hear anything about any karma. - What's going on? - I'm gonna find out. I'm gonna check out the elevator shaft. - Yeah, okay. - Maybe there's a way out. - Oh, Jesus. - What's happening? Are they bats? - Danny? Oh, God! Oh, God! Somebody help me! Please! Please! Somebody help me! Please! Oh, God! Please! No! No! No! No! Ah, come on. Just when it was getting to the good part. - Christ, not again. Hey, take a little breather, honey. I lost my concentration. Goddamn piece of crap. Looks like the only thing working around here is me. - Sons of bitches. - That's what you get... for stealing cable, Buck. The first full solar eclipse to be seen locally in over 35 years-- ...while transporting Luther Heggs... from the Kern County Jail to the Huntsville State Penitentiary. Heggs, you may remember, was convicted for armed robbery. An unscheduled stop was made at a gas station rest room. When Heggs persuaded the deputy to remove one of the cuffs so he could use the toilet... Heggs severely beat the deputy... wrestled away the key to the cuffs and fled the scene. - Looks like Luther beat the dog shit... - In a moment we'll be speaking... - out of that boy. - to legendary Texas Ranger Otis Lawson. Officer Lawson, could we have the latest developments concerning Luther Heggs? Yes. Uh, we have all available-- Hey, ain't that the old boy who put you away in that Lubbock bank job? Rotten bastard. I'd like to say that... I-I-I will personally track down Luther Heggs... and drag his ass back to the penitentiary... where the sorry son of a bitch belongs. All right, asshole. Start talking. - You got a warrant, Otis? - Did I give you that? Damn, Sheriff. I thought I-- Let's see, did you-- - There is it. ls that warrant enough for you? Huh? - Forget about the warrant, Otis. - Okay. - Thank you for cooperating. Now, where is he? Don't say, "Who?" I ain't heard a peep from him. Oh, shit. Goddamn. Luther and me-- We ain't as tight as we once was. Ever since l went straight. I don't run in them circles. Bullshit, Buck. Goddamn it. You're a criminal. You always were, and you always will be. - Just like your daddy. - No, I swear to God, Otis. - I'm selling them Swifty products. - Shut up. - Show her the picture. - You seen this man? - Yes, I have. - When and where? About an hour ago, on the TV. Do you think we're just wasting our time coming over here... like we suck farts out of a dead chicken? - She don't know nothing about it. - She might not, but you sure do. 'Cause you and Luther are butt-buddies... from way back. And sooner or later, he's gonna contact you... and when he does, we'll be waiting. Don't forget that, slick. Ma'am. - Yeah? - Well, hey, Mama. - Shit. Yeah, well, listen, Mama. I'm gonna have to call you back a little bit later, all right? - All right. I love you too. - Buck... your mama's dead. - Yeah? - You clear? - It is now. Are you okay? - Yeah. l've been better. Listen up, man. That Mexican bank deal is back on. We gotta move double fast, though. - Are you sure the money's still there? - Yeah, it's still there. Five million in freshly-laundered... gringo drug money. Round up a crew and meet me at that El Coyote Motel across the border tomorrow night. All right, Luther. Shit. I gotta get out of here, man. I'll be in around 7:30, run the whole thing down to everybody. And now, ladies and gentlemen... - the champion of champions... Roddy Pugh! All right! Yeah! Hang on, cowboy, I'm coming. Come here, bull! Come to me! Come to me, baby! Come here! Watch out for that there bull! Come on! Better run, better run! There goes Widow Maker! Howdy, C.W. Did you see it? Yep. I reckon I've lost a step. I reckon. So how the hell are things, C.W.? Well, I fractured my ass bone... Fay left me... I'm three months behind on my note... and I had to hock my horse and trailer. Goddamn, man. lf your dog was dead, we'd have us a country song. Scooter got hit by a car and killed last month. Jesus, C.W., I'm sorry. I was just joking, man. Oh, hell, Buck. You know me and good luck was always strangers. So what's the pitch? I'm guessing you didn't come here to scout my clowning skills. Nah, there's no clowning involved here. Luther's got a deal going. Looks like a good one. We need you to open the box. - Is my end more than a hundred thou? - Way more. Jesus, it's Buck. Don't shoot, you paranoid son of a bitch. Didn't you see the signs? The only thing I gotta beware of is your crazy ass. Got a beer? - Jaws is looking pretty strong. - Jaws is dead. I lost him in a fight a while back. This is Jaws 2. I got him on the juice. You're pumping steroids into a pooch? Damn, Jesus. That's immoral. Hey, it ain't the fuckin' Olympics, Buck. I mean, this is dog fighting. He's got a big match coming up. Hey, go, Jaws, go! I got a deal you might want to get in on. Who's setting up the deal? - Luther. - Besides you and Luther... who else is on the crew? C.W. Niles and Ray Bob. Ray Bob? He's an idiot. I don't work with idiots. They get you killed. Yeah, well, you don't pick the crew, l do. And I say he's in. You don't like it, fuck you. - What would my end be? - Figure 600 grand, give or take. - How's that Lincoln running? - Like a burnt dead dog. Good boy! That's a good boy! Go, Jaws! Go! Yeah, that's a good boy. Bucky! What the hell! What do you want to sneak up on me like that for, huh, Bucky? That's some tight-ass security you got going here, Ray Bob. I thought you was the damn supervisor. Oh, hell, Bucky. There ain't nothing here to guard anyway. - So what's up? - A job's what's up. Set us up for a good long time. Yeah? I don't know, Bucky. - I mean, Alma's got me on such a short leash and all. - Knock it off... you pussy-whipped son of a bitch. I'm going out on the line for you here. You ain't exactly everybody's first choice. Really? Wh-When-When's this supposed to happen? - We hit the road tomorrow. Going to Mexico. - What am I gonna tell Alma? - I don't care what you tell her. You just pack a bag, bring your .45 and be ready to roll at high noon. Get some sleep. - Twice a day. - Si, senor. Hey, Buck, C.W. Nice ride, Jesus. - Well, l had to tell her something. Ray Bob, we don't need this shit. Ready. El Coyote? What's that mean in American, Jesus? The coyote. - It ideal. - Come in with me, Jesus. Just in case I gotta talk Mexican. C.W., take the car down to number seven, start unloading the gear. Howdy. You speak English, lady? English, Spanish and a little bit of Japanese. We need a room. Number seven will do. Hey, baby. El fucko? Sweet Jesus. Come on, Jesus. - Now ain't the time. Let's get this crap inside quick. Yowza, boss. - This movie is very low quality. Don't look that bad to me. - There's no story. - It's a fuck movie. I don't watch a fuck movie for the story. I watch a fuck movie to see fuckin'. I got to side with Jesus on this one. I personally appreciate an attempt at telling a story. When I care more about the characters, I care more about the fucking. Now, my main complaint about this movie here... is we've been watching it for something like a half hour, - and there ain't been no ass fuckin'. - Fuck me runnin'. This is my kind of place. Christ. - Howdy. Give me a shot of tequila, man. Here you go. Goddamn, man! Give me a... shot of whiskey or something. Say, what would be the odds of gettin' a cab out here? Odds of getting a cab are about zero to none. - No cabs come out here. - Shit. - You got car trouble? - Yeah. Weirdest thing, man. I hit a fuckin' bat. Messed up my vehicle real good. Hell, you say. Where you headed? - That El Coyote Motel. - I get off in about half hour. Would you like a lift? - Yep? - Hey, Buck. Broke down, man. Luther, we were starting to worry about you, boy. - Want us to come and get you? - No, y'all stay put. This old boy here is gonna give me a lift. Mighty decent of you, man. I appreciate it. No problem. What kind of bat did you hit? I don't know, man. A fuckin' bat. A big one. - You know, there's many varieties of bats. - Yeah? I didn't know that. Damn thing scared the shit out of me, though. I pumped a bullet in the bastard. Aren't we going the wrong direction here, man? Is that your jeep? Yeah. Look, I'm kind of in a hurry here. You know what I mean? Just take a second. Come on. You said you hit a big, old fuckin' bat. Where is it? Well, man, I imagine it crawled off somewhere to die. I don't see no point in all of this. Oh, there's a point, all right. Victor. Victor. Victor. How bad is it? I don't think I'm gonna make it. Damn, man. You need to get to a hospital, quick like. ls this him? Yeah, that's him. What the fuck you talkin' about, man? I ain't never seen this guy in my life. I think this belongs to you. Victor. - Fuck. Oh, God! Come on, fuckin' bat! Come on! Look out for the gun! Adios. Fuck. Boy, I'd sure like to do me... one of them porno star bitches. I did me one of them porno star bitches once. She had a small part in Splendor in the Ass 2. - You ever see that? - No, I never saw it. But I'd sure go rent it. Which one is she? She's in the scene where Wendy West goes to the dentist. There's this black female dentist... and a red-haired dentist's helper. I hammered the redhead. What happened at the dentist's? They all fuck each other. What do you think? lt's a porno movie. - I know this Mexican guy, Carlos. He found out his sister was doing porno in L.A. So he waited till she was doing another porno film... and he went down to the set... with a shotgun. And he went completely crazy. Carlos! He shot the director. - He shot the cameraman. - No! No! He shot the guy who was drilling her. And then... he even shot the guy... who brings the doughnuts. Huh? Man, this is just so cool, guys. I mean, I'm gettin' to do a big job with all my buddies. - I mean, this is so great. - Hey, Ray Bob. Do you know who was asking about you? - No, who? - No one. - Get off his ass, Jesus. I ain't on his ass yet. I ain't gonna have internal squabbling on this deal. - Where the hell you goin'? - For a walk. Yeah, well, don't stray too far. Luther's due any time. I bet you my ass he's going over to that little senorita's room... - to get his dick wet. - Kind of figured Luther'd be here by now. Luther. What are you doing here? I just dropped in for a quick bite. - What the fuck! Take that, bitch! No. No. No. No. - Who is it? - It's room service. Open up, you idiots. Look who l found. Hot damn, Luther. - I ain't seen you in a coon's age. - C.W. God Almighty, Luther. We thought you was never even gonna show up. I got dropped off up the road a piece there. Hoofed it the last mile or so. Damn, Jesus. That little split tail drain the life out of you? You look like a damn ghost. She sucked me dry. Damn. Hey, Luther. I just wanted to say I appreciate you bringing me on this job and all. All right, girls. Gather 'round. The bank's in Bravos, right here near the border. When you planning on pulling this thing off? - We'll be going on this little expedition tonight. - "Tonight"? God dog, you gotta be kiddin' me. We got to work things out. Case the joint, shit like that. Yeah, Luther, I never knowed you to go into a deal half-cocked. We're gonna do this thing my way... which means we're gonna do it tonight. Or all of you are gonna walk away with nothin'. Are you homos in or are you out? I'm in. Well, I sure as hell ain't walkin' away from 600 grand and change. What's the big hurry, Luther? What the hell are you? Cinderella? For one thing, that motel clerk got a good look at me. I think she might have made me. Well, now, you might ought to have mentioned that to me before. Well, I'll fill you in on a need-to-know basis. Well, I need to know everything. All right then. From now on, Buck, I'll tell you everything. - Fair enough? - Yeah. Are you in or not? I reckon I'm in. All right then. Let's head 'em up and move 'em out! What the hell we need this stuff for? I think it looks cool. Just a precaution. Looks like a goddamn bloodbath. You tryin' to be funny? No, sir. Why don't you go on outside and get some air? Yeah. What's his problem? My boy's suffering from some serious hurt. Them Gecko brothers killed his daddy. - You remember old McGraw, don't you? - Sure. Sons of bitches shot old Earl dead in the head. What the hell you figure happened here? God only knows, and He ain't talkin'. Jesus, when you guys are done unloading... pull the car out in front of the bank there. In just a minute... I'm gonna open this here door. How the hell are you gonna do that? I done told you. I got this thing all worked out, man. God Almighty, Luther. You'd think somebody had done and gone give you the keys to the place. What did you have to kill the guard for? It was him or me, Buck. What about the other alarms? There are a couple of motion detectors back here by the safe. You guys won't have to worry about that. C.W., crack this box. Jesus Christ. - All right, C.W. Do your magic. Don't touch nothin' you don't have to. What's wrong, Luth? A little asthma attack. That's all. Let's go. Yee-ha! So far, so good, huh, Bucky? I don't think so, Ray Bob. We got us a dead guard here. When them Mexicans catch us, they're gonna fry our asses or hang us-- one. Oh, man. You're a goddamn artist, C.W. - lt's an honor just watching you work. Just let me know when you need the lubricating oil. What are you tryin' to do, cornhole me? Back off a little bit, Luther. Give me a little room to work here. And get this goddamn thing out of the way. - Luther, you all right? Asthma, my ass. I vote we get out of here while we've still got a chance. - Cops are on the way. Let's get out of here. - Damn it. All right, time is still on our side. Now, all those cops can do is slow us down a little bit. - "Slow us down"? Hell, they'll kill our asses. - We ain't goin' anywhere. C.W. has almost got this thing licked now. You just settle your ass down. - What are you, retarded? Let's get out of here! - Back off, man! We're about to be millionaires. We're gonna be dead millionaires, we don't move it. Get out of here if you want to. l don't care. Just leave more for us. Come on, Ray Bob, let's get the hell out of here. - What about the money, Bucky? - It's over, Ray Bob. There ain't gonna be no money. Now, let's go. You comin' with us? I'll take my chances. Well, you're as crazy as they are. - What do we do now, Bucky? - Run! - Man, they're everywhere. - Shit! - They're shootin' at us, Buck! - Get back inside! - You said we was gonna make it, Bucky. - Shut up, Ray Bob! Hey, I was just starting to miss you guys. Listen up, you idiots! Get out of there and come out with your hands up... and we will not kill you. I give you my word. Take your time and think it over. You've got two minutes. Ah, Jesus Christ! Oh, God Almighty. I don't know how many of them are in there... but your boy, Buck, is one of them. Well, I'll tell you one thing, Chief. You work pretty damn fast. Hey, baby. I thought I told you never to call me at work. - This is Lawson here. - Otis. Hey, how's your wife tasting? None of your business, you son of a bitch. First off, who the hell are you, and is Luther Heggs in there? I'm Jesus, and, yeah, Luther's here. And Buck Bowers, who you know intimately. Then, goddamn it, put Buck on. You stupid bastard. You're lucky I ain't done put a bullet in your head. Yeah? Well, you cornholed the pooch this time, boy. Oh, I'd have to agree with you on that one, Otis. There is a bank guard in there by the name of Reuben Salto Guitierrez. We want to speak to him. You got a bank guard in there by the name of Reuben ""Salsa Goudaresm--"" H-H-How the hell you pronounce it? Put him on the phone. - I want to speak to him. - Uh-- Well, he's still alive, isn't he? Sure, he's fine. Well, then put him on the phone. Give me a minute. Jesus... tell him everything's okay in Mexican. There you go. Told you he's okay. Now, listen up, Buck. Let the guard go. You guys come out with your hands up high... and we promise that we ain't gonna kill you. Well, now, Otis, l think I'm gonna have to pass on that offer. What about this: We take the guard with us. You give us a ten-minute head start, and then we'll let him go. - Ain't gonna happen, Bucko. - Come on, Otis. Work with me here. Now, the way l figure-- - Hello? - What the hell are you doin', man? - That was our last chance to make a deal! - There ain't gonna be no deals. Besides, I'm tired of listening to your chatter! My pit ain't the only one on the juice. Come on, guys. Hey, we ain't gotta fight, man. - Yeah. End of the line, assholes! - Goddamn it. That's got it. You the man, C.W. You the man! Good God, Gerty! What a gorge! We're right on schedule, buddy. Got a half hour before sunrise. - It's the fattest one l ever cracked. I'll take care of that. Get one of the guys back here and bag up the rest of this cash. What in God's name is going on up there? Get out of there! Get out of there now, damn it! - What the hell was that all about? - God Almighty. I think we're gonna have to make a radical move here, Ray Bob. Now, I know this sounds totally insane... but I think Luther, C.W. and Jesus-- - What? - Hey, look, if I don't go take a leak right now... I'm gonna piss in my pants. Sal, can you see anything on top of that bank? I can't see anything up there. Tear gas everywhere. Sal? Come in, Sal. - Sal? - Sal? Ray Bob, give me a hand loading this green stuff. Shit. God Almighty. Where did Luther get off to? Uh, he's in the can. Let's get this stuff loaded. Let's get moving. Cutting it pretty close. All right, you assholes. Get back here and give us a hand loading this cash up. Hell, yeah. Jesus, I do believe you're the greediest son of a bitch l ever knowed. - Where's Buck at? - Breathing down your neck. - Take it back, Jesus. You're the second greediest son of a bitch l ever knowed. lt's not about the money, you stupid bastard. Ray Bob, get over here. You get away from them. Don't you cocksuckers move a muscle. I want you to drop your guns on the floor, and l want you to kick 'em towards me. Oh, Bucky, what are you doing? They're vampires, Ray Bob. I know that sounds fucked-up, but that's what they are. And we're getting the hell out of here, Ray Bob. Even going to the pen's better than getting killed by one of these bloodsuckers. Buck, you paranoid son of a bitch. Now, Ray Bob, even you, dumb fuck that you are, ain't buying into this, right? Ray Bob, l wouldn't be willing to go out there, if l didn't know what was in here-- - Gettin' to you, boys. Get in there! - Now! Fuck. Hey! - Hey! Bucky. - Bucky. Bucky. - The doors! I never thought I'd be happy to see you bastards. Do me a favor. Take that knife out of my leg. Hold it. You gotta listen to me. You don't know what you're dealing with in there. -Get this piece of shit out of my sight. -Otis, listen to me! No, you listen to me! You had your chance to talk, and you blew it. Now, goddamn it, the game's over! Get him in there. I guarantee you it ain't over! Otis, it ain't over! - Otis, listen to me! Otis! Otis, you gotta listen to me! Otis! - Let's do it. - Otis! - You don't know what it is in there! - Go! You don't know what's in there! Goddamn it, Otis. Now will you listen to me? Let me out of the fucking car, you asshole! Ah, shit! We're toast! Otis, you got the sun! What are you waitin' on, man? Go in there and kill 'em! I'm not sending any more men in there to get slaughtered until l figure out... what the hell it is we're dealing with here. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me! - Oh, shit! - Come here, you sexy bitch. You son of a bitch. What the hell's going on here? - They're making happy meals out of our ass. - They're goddamn vampires, Otis! All right, suppose they are. What can we do about it? - I think l know a way we can take 'em out. - Tell me. - You gotta uncuff me first. - Well, you tell me, and we'll take 'em out. Get these cuffs off me now! - Fuck you. Come on, kid. - Otis! - Fuck you. - You take these cuffs off me, Otis! Otis! Get these cuffs off me! No! All right, let's hear it. And this better be good. You ain't hearing nothin' until you get these cuffs off of me. Looks like it's just about over, Otis. Looks like you might be right, Luther. - Take that, you cocksucker. We'll take care of these pussies. Get the car loaded up. l was just gettin' the car ready. If you weren't already dead, I'd kill your ass. - That's for the kid. Time to come with us, Buck. - The bite ain't that bad. - Bite my ass. This is no time for long good-byes, asshole. - Yeah! - Oh, man! - Boo! - Shit! Otis! - Fuck, your luck's done run out, Luther. Let's get the hell out of here while we still got some dark left. You just don't ever give up, do you, Bucky? l admire that. - Couldn't just go along with the program, could you? - You had to be a hero! Had to play the old, tough cowboy, huh? - You had to fuck everything up, didn't you? - What's wrong, tough guy? Happy trails! - How you feeling now, Bucky? - Fuck. Jesus! You about gave me a heart attack, Otis. Yeah. Nice shades. We're the goddamn fearless vampire killers, ain't we, Otis? Yeah, too bad there ain't much call for that kind of work. Yeah, l don't imagine. Tell me something, Buck. What in the hell are vampires doing robbing a bank? You got me. I suppose vampires need money just like anybody else. I guess. Nope. Gave 'em up. Use one of those patches? - No. Cold turkey. - Goddamn. - You ever miss 'em? - Aw... every once in a while. After a good, hot cup of coffee... after a good meal and... a good, hard fuck... but... not too often. Well, I think l might have to make a run for it, Otis. l ain't never done too good locked up in one of them cages. Spent too much of my life like that already. Well, I suppose l ought to try and stop you. I don't think you're in no shape to stop nobody. - I don't imagine you're gonna make it. Maybe. Maybe not
