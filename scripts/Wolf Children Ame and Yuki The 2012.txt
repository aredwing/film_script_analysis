To my mother, it felt like the entire world had been reborn overnight. The year after that, I moved out of our home and into the middle school dorms. Looking back at those twelve years she spent raising us, my mother said they'd passed her by in the blink of an eye, like it was a fairy tale. And she said it with a smile on her face. One of complete satisfaction. And she said it while looking at faraway peak. That smile of hers makes me... extremely happy.
