Come quick! There's Yanks. Hundreds of 'em. As if we hadn't enough of them already. - Aye. Mother won't be pleased. - But you will, eh? Aye. I like Yanks. Hey, sugar, you wanna hitch? - Why don't you come in here with us? - There's more room in a tin of sardines. Yeah, ma'am, but not as much action! Pretty country. Look at all that green, Danny. Winter and it's still green. You think they've got any more like that little bus conductress? Don't you think about anything else? Three weeks on a boat pulling my pud and scratching louse bites. You're diseased, Danny. Brains all between your legs. Tea break. That's all I ever hear around this goddamn place. That's right, Sergeant. Fancy a cup? I got 210 men due here any minute now. They're gonna want water. They won't get any unless you fix the fucking pipe. - It's fixed. - Why ain't it coming out the other end? It's waiting. Till it's turned on. - This is good. - Would it be possible to get it turned on? - Yes. After I've had my tea. - Fucking limeys. Why don't you have a cup, Yank? Calm you down a bit. Don't call me Yank. I'm not a damn Yankee. I'm from Ardmore, Oklahoma. Howdy! Give me some of that soap. Hey, honey! Oh, my God. - Over here! Over here! - Hey, will you look at that? Dames! I'm feeling warmer already! The Red Cross only do it for officers. So don't put your uniform on. They'll never tell the difference. - Hey! - Over here! - Welcome to England. - Thank you, ma'am. - Welcome to England. - Hi, GI. - Where are you from? - Connecticut. - Welcome to England. - Thanks. Keep your eye on the doughnut, not on the hole. Thanks, lady. Boston, Mass. - Welcome to England. - Hi, GI. - Where are you from? - Louisville, Kentucky. Honey, it stinks. - Have a nice hot cuppa. - Thank you, ma'am. - What's the matter? - I think I'm in love. I think you've been too long on the boat. - Welcome to England. - Get outta here. - Where are you from? - Arizona. - Name? - Private Jacques. - Name? - Ruffelo. .I hear you're quite a boxer? - Golden gloves. - Keep your hands to yourself round here. - Name? - Dyson. It's a beautiful country. A little chilly. They forgot to put the roof on. - What are the women like? - I haven't met one yet. - When do we get a pass, sir? - What's a pass? Thank you, ma'am. - Welcome to England. - Psst. I got the truck for the orchestra on Saturday. - Oh. Wonderful. Thank you. - Can I have one with sugar? Fantastic. Thanks a lot. - And where do you come from? - Burlington, lowa. Stretch out. Make sure those waistline muscles are pulling. - Morning, Dad. - Morning, love. Morning, Clarrie. - Won't be a minute with your overalls. - That's all right, love. I like 'em warm, anyway. It's bloody freezing this morning on the bike. - What shift you on? - Nine till seven. Not again. You'll kill yourself, that's what you'll do. Doing two jobs, it's just ridiculous. It's the same for everybody, isn't it? - Geoffrey, come and get your breakfast. - Coming. - You do look worn out. - I am, love. Mind the plate. It's hot. - Geoffrey! - Coming, Mother. - Morning. - Morning, lad. - Morning, Geoff. - Morning. - Where did you get that hat from? - Billy Rathbone gave it to me. - Where did he get it from? - The fish-and-chip run. - The what? - The chip run. Kids fetch fish and chips for the Yanks at the camp. - Billy's the big organiser. - They pay us. - He's letting me help him on Saturday. - You'll do no such thing. - Mother. - Take that silly cap off at the table. - Mother! - Take it off, Geoffrey. - They're very good to the kids. - Are they? You like your brother behaving like some little scrounger? - Really! - Perhaps it's how you see yourself. Amusement to foreigners with more money than sense. - Honestly! - Your Ken might have something to say. - Dad. - They're only lads, Mother. Soldiers thousands of miles from home. - We should be grateful. - Oh, but I am grateful. We need all the help we can get. But do they have to act as though they own the place? Go on. Move it out of the way. All the way. Fucking limey rain. - Driver, right on back to receiving. - OK, Sergeant. What we gonna do with all this shit? 5650-0086-35. No way. I'm not signing for something I didn't get. Look on the manifest. You got ten crates of binoculars. - This is a binocular? Come on! - OK, so they fucked up a little. It's the army. What do you expect? I got a little Scotch in the truck. You keep the sneakers, you get two cases. - You trying to bribe a fellow officer? - I gotta get outta here. - I'm shocked at you. - Four cases. - Six. - That's robbery. I don't want the Scotch for myself. Look at these poor, wet, miserable bastards. Outside working their asses off. These are my men. I couldn't face myself if I didn't look after them. You're as full of shit as a Christmas turkey. - You're the one with his nuts in a wringer. - OK, six cases. - Thanks. - Thank you. Schmuck. Convoy six, attention in the mess hall. Some of you guys haven't stored... - More onions and potatoes in there. - Right. Some of those leftover bones. Give it some flavour. - Sure thing, Matt. - Cigarette out. I'll take some of those grits. What about some of those ham hocks? A little bit of greens. Some gravy. - I'll be back for the watermelon later. - You do that. Next. Hold on to it. Hold on to it. Hold on! Let go! Let go! - We got it! - Don't lose it, whatever it is. - A pass, dummy. We got a pass! - No shit! I hear some of these giris ain't seen men for years. Can you imagine? Years. Hurry up! Get changed! They've waited years, Danny. I think they can wait a couple more hours. Any more fares, please? Any more fares? Any more? Any more fares, please? Coach and Horses next stop. Coach and Horses. Coach and Horses. Coach and Horses, Dad. Come on, now. Any more fares? Who hasn't paid me? Come on, now. Night, Dad. Be careful. - There you go, sir. - Thank you, Sergeant. - Is he gonna be OK? - Who, the sergeant major? He'd find the Coach and Horses with his head in a bucket. Could an' all, that one. - What did she say? - I don't know. How far you going, lads? No cracks from you, cheeky face. I've heard it all before. Town, is it? First time? Cat caught his tongue? Shy. Very shy boy. Scared of women. - Oh. Two fours, please. - I'll get it. - You OK? - Yeah. One sixpence, two pennies. Ta, love. Any more fares, please? D'you hear that? She called me love. I don't think it's personal. Last stop now. Come on. Everybody off. This is it. Little America. Town terminus. Come on, lads. All out. This is it. As far as we go. - I heard there was fog. This is ridiculous. - Night, love. - Is this town? - Just a couple of minutes' walk, love. - Follow that road there. - OK. Thank you. Hey, cherub. - Me? - Come here. Here. Just in case you get lost. What's it say? It says we're going to the movies. All right! # Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run # Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run # Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun # He'll get by without his rabbit pie # So run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run - If they come, I'm not speaking to them. - Don't. I'm not bothered. - Do you want half? Last one. - If you're offering. # I've got tuppence to spend and tuppence to lend # And tuppence to send home to my wife My mother'll kill me. If only you'd asked me first. How could I? They were on my bus. - Hey, there they are. - # The sage in bloom is like perfume # Deep in the heart of Texas Excuse me. Come on, come on. This is Movietone. Leslie Mitchell reporting. The latest films to arrive from the Burma front show... Sorry we're late, but it was so goddamn dark we couldn't find it. It's a blackout, chuck. Show 'em a light and they drop a bomb on you. - They're like that, the Jerries. Nasty. - Shh! - The name's Danny. - Mollie. - This is Matt. - Hi. - This is Jean. - Glad to know you, Jean. - Shh! - I said glad to know you, Jean. Do you mind? I'm trying to watch the news. The object of this attack was to obtain identification of Japanese troops reported to be in occupation. - Cigarette? - No. Oh, ta. - Did you see that? - Shut up! Matt, you gotta be quiet. She's trying to watch the news. Fish and chips four times, is it? - Eating them now? - I'm starving! Help yourself to salt and vinegar. Here you are, Jean. There's nothing on 'em. - Cod and chips twice. - More batter here, Doris. Get out of it! You can talk! There, soldier. Get that down you and you'll not do so bad. - You ain't kidding. - Half a crown, love. Oh, sure. Uh... No, two shillings and sixpence. Take him on one side and teach him. He'd best learn t'money or they'll do him right, left and centre. - Now, son, what's yours? - Fish and chips, please. 36 times. - We'll be here all night! - You don't look like a boxer to me. - What do you mean? You know what they call me? Boom-boom Ruffelo. - Boom-boom! - Really. Cos I got power in both hands. - I got power somewhere else too. - Bragging again, are we? We're not having a very good time, are we? No, I'm fine, really. - You been out with an American? - No. Maybe that's what's bothering you. - A girl gets a name going with Americans. - I ain't... And my family has a shop here. - See you tomorrow, Jean. - Mollie, wait a minute. - Matt, see you at the barracks. - I must go. - Behave yourself! - What are you so scared about? - You don't have to be scared of me. - I'm not scared. Cos I tell you, I'm the one that ought to be scared. Think about it. Here I am, God knows where, God knows how long. I'm out with the first real English girl I ever met. That's pretty scary. I told you, it isn't you. - Somebody else? - Hm. - Right. He's in the army? - Yes. We're getting engaged when he gets leave. But you're not engaged yet, so you can see me again. I don't understand. I've told you there's no point. I'd just like to see you again. Like tonight. We could go take in a movie, something to eat, go for a walk. No fancy moves. You just want a girl. - The woods are full of giris. - Pick yourself one. Look, you never ever met anyone like me before. - No one as modest, anyway. - I didn't mean it like that, like bragging. It's like I never met anyone like you before. Oh. I'm not that special. Sure you're special. I think everybody's special. - First of all, you're a foreigner. - Oh, I see. Are we in America now? You shouldn't have any trouble finding your way home. - I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. - Good night. Wait. Where are you going? - It's all right. My mistake. - You got me all wrong. - Sorry. - I take it all back. I'm the foreigner. - I don't know how to get back. - Keep going till you get to the monument. Thanks a lot. Where's the monument? - Shit! Where did you get it, Annie? Our last kid brought it home with him. - The one that was wounded? - Aye, in Africa. Said he'd have brought the bloody head as well if they'd let him. - Here's your stamps, Mrs Shenton. - Could have been worse, Clarrie. - Could have been a Yank's. - Ooh, I wish it had been. With a Yank in it and all. They're my sort of lads, the Yanks. Hi. - Can I help you? - That's very kind of you, ma'am. - Is it OK if I just look around? - Yes, of course. - Ta-ra. - Goodbye, Mrs Shenton. - See you. - Bye. Goodbye. Sure there's nothing I can help you with? Yeah. Do you carry - what do you call them - bicycle clips? - We do. - Could I try them on? Certainly. Jean, would you take care of Annie, please? Yes, Mother. - Hey! Those are clothing coupons, love. - Oh, sorry. Sorry. - Shall I put yours on account, Annie? - Yes, please, love. It's pensin day on Thursday. I'll have to get myself one of these lads. Pay you cash then, no danger. I can't seem to find them anywhere. You're not climbing ladders, Mother. - Go and see to my dad's tea. - Thank you, Jean. - I'll be in the kitchen if you need me. - All right. One pair of bicycle clips. - I wanna take you to the movies. - No, thank you. I've already told you I've got a boyfriend. Perhaps you don't believe me. You'd like to see a photograph. Yeah, that'd be nice. Maybe I should ask your mom. - Don't you dare! - She'd show me. - Matt! - Oh, remembered my name. Now, please, be sensible. - OK, let's both be sensible. - Right. - How much do I owe you? - One shilling, please. - There you go. - Thank you. - Saturday, the Ritz, eight o'clock. - No, thanks. - All right, I'm going. - You are? I look like the kind of guy to cause trouble? .It's OK. I'll just be back tomorrow. - Good morning, lvy. - She's round the back. .You're not much help .standing there staring. .I'm not staring, I'm admiring. - You're early, aren't you? - I'm always early. .You just never noticed. .Here, let me give you a hand. - You'll get dirt on your uniform. - I'm used to dirt. .I worked my way through law school .collecting garbage. - I thought you washed dishes. - I did that too. I did lots of things. - Dug ditches, shovelled coal, drove a taxi. - Phone, Miss Helen! Master Tim. - Can you bring those leeks? - Sure. That's what I'm here for. .Tim? This is getting ridiculous. .Nothing but phone, phone, phone. .Why aren't you at school? .I am at school. They're playing rugger. - Shouldn't you be playing too? - Yes, but... I try. .I'm just no good at it. - They all bully me. - I see. .I try my best, Mum. - What do you say, giris? - Hi. - Fresh new crop of Gls just came in. - Hey! .Hey-hey! Huh? .Just kids, most of them. .Ivy, listen. This is for you too. .Don't break their hearts. .I gotta turn them into a fighting machine. - Before you start, would you like tea? - No, thanks. .I'm floating in the stuff. I'm gonna go .into the living room. The drawing room. . It's terrible for all of us. How do .you think Daddy feels about being away? .Hm. That's better. - How are you, Mrs Moreton? - Can't complain, Captain. .Good. .Yes, I will write tonight. Right. Chin up. - I'll see you in two weeks. - Yes, all right. See you then. - Yes, bye. - Bye, darling. - I can't play when anybody's watching. - I like watching you play. .So angry with yourself when you make .a mistake, as if you weren't allowed. - It tells me something about you. - That I can't play the piano, yeah? - Are you cold? - Well, it ain't Miami. .You don't have to drink it. - What was all that about? - I said no to a cup of tea. .Sacrilege. - I got a letter from Ann today. - Oh, you must be pleased. .Peter hasn't written for weeks. .Well, he'll have written, of course, but... .She sold our house. .Just like that. .She put the furniture into storage, packed .up the kids and moved in with her family. - Didn't want to bother you. - She didn't tell me till after it was done. - She doesn't even like her family. - Perhaps she didn't want to be alone. .I wonder why she didn't tell me, though. .Do you tell her everything? .So far. .I remember we did talk about it. .I mean, when I knew .I was gonna come overseas here, .and the fact that I might not come back. - She'd be saddled with responsibilities. - That's a bit pessimistic, isn't it? .Yeah, I think she'd call it realistic. .When Peter went away, we decided .we'd play it down, take it in our stride. .Everyone did. We had to. .Three very long years. .Where would we have been .if we'd been realistic? - Here. - Oh! Thank you. - Here you go, ma'am. - Hello. Ooh! .Stop that! - Son of a bitch! - All right! .Go on.

You got .your own little cabin and bathroom. .They're springing up all over the States. .I'm gonna build me one of them. .I got a place all picked out too. .It's on a canyon. .The top of the canyon flattens out .and I'm gonna build it there. .It's beautiful. Out there you've still got .wide open spaces. Roads are straight. .Not like here. When I come here, .I feel kinda hemmed in, you know. .Anyway, that's what I'm gonna do. - I'm sure you will. - I will. .And when that one gets going, .I'm gonna build another one. .And then I'm gonna build another one. .And another one. .Your guy, does he bring you up here? .Ken?

Please." ."All my love, Tim." - Very good. Well done, darling. - Jolly good. - How's Anna? - Fine. She sends glowing letters. .I'm afraid Tim's inherited .all my insecurities. .Oh, Helen, he'll soon settle down. .We had the same problem with Patrick .when he first went away to school. .You mustn't give in to him. .Nobody likes to see a boy unhappy, .but you must not give in. - Some take longer than others. - A question of backbone. .You have to ask yourself "What is it..." .Do you think I should bring Tim home? .I don't think a kid should have to .stay miserable for the sake of tradition. .It's a very good school. .He could get over his problems. - Peter and all his family went there. - Yeah, well, Tim's not Peter. - You don't believe in tradition? - Not in that kind. Neither do you. .Do what you feel .and never mind duties, responsibilities... .All those things aren't much unless .you can support them with feelings. .They hold you together sometimes. .Let them go. You won't fall apart. .Are you happy? .I like what I'm doing. .Do you sleep well at night? .Planes keep me awake. .You're incredibly beautiful, you know. .Thank you. - I've said that to a lot of women. - I'm sure you have. .I even meant it once or twice. .Nobody's ever surprised me like you do, .you know. .Go with your instincts. .You make it too simple. .I come from a simple, primitive people. .Mongrels. We got no traditions. .Trust your feelings. .I feel... .that you should go back to the camp .and I should go up to bed. .Wrong again. Don't trust what you feel. .Thank you, John. .You do help me, you know. .Just think of me as the Red Cross. .Don't let the planes keep you awake. .First time you've cooked .since you've been sergeant. .Why do you think they promoted him? .Who are you poisoning this time? .Fuck you and the boat that brought you. .Look! He's using real eggs! - It's got to be for a girl. - What else is worth all the trouble? .You ever noticed .how much limey giris stink? .As a matter of fact, it's not just the giris. .All limeys stink. - What do you mean, stink? - They don't wash, so they stink. - Some stink. Some don't stink. - They all stink. .Their hair, their clothes, .everything about them. .We must be getting used to it. .But they still stink. - My girl don't stink. - You don't smell it any more. .No, I've seen her wash. .I don't wanna hear no more about it. .OK, sarge. OK. - She don't stink. - OK. .Even if she did, you know what? I'd like it. - The table looks lovely, Mother. - Is it all right? - Ham as well? - You wouldn't know we were rationed. .Let's hope he likes it, Jean. Geoffrey, go .and fetch me some chutney. Home-made. .There's an article .about the three Roberts boys. .Lost at sea when the ship went down. .I'd better call round. .Don't mention that .in front of the American, Jim. .Why the hell not? .Wouldn't be tactful. .He's not seen active service. - It's the Yank. - Why didn't you open the door? .He's not coming to see me. - Hi. - Hello. Would you like to come in? .Thank you. - I hope I'm not late. - No. .No, of course not. - This is my brother Geoff. - Geoff. .How you doing?

That's something .I sent the wife from the front. .They came round .with the needles and ribbons and that. - You made it? - Yeah. Strange, really, isn't it? - What are these? - The medals they gave us. .That's the victory medal there, .and the 1914-18 war... .That's what we call a pineapple. - A pineapple? - Here. Give that a try. - Good, isn't it? - Yeah, great. .Now we'll try this thing here. .Here's a peach. .I can see what you see in him, Jean. .He's thoughtful. Very pleasant. .If it wasn't for Ken... .I just wish we knew more about him. .That's it, Danny! Kill the limey! - Bloody Yankee! - Get away from him! Stay away! . Smash his bloody ugly face in! .Hit him! Keep your head up! .Hit him in the guts! Come on! Go! .Go on, Danny! . Danny, get that limey bastard! . All the way, USA! .All right, Danny! Champ! .How are you? - All right. How long you home for? - Two weeks of freedom. - Let's wear your hat. - Go on, shorty, but I want it back. - Hello, Mrs Shenton. - Hello, Ken, love. Welcome home. .Thank you. You're looking well. .How are you? Can I carry your kitbag? .No mucking about. Government property. .Come on, shorty. Pick your feet up. .You all right, lad? .Huh? Yeah, I'm all right. .Come on, snap out of it. .Well, Jean, you're a grand girl and .we've watched you grow up with pride. .And we don't give you away easy. .It'd take a special kind of lad .to persuade us. .But Ken here, well, he is. .You know, us old 'uns, .we do our best here at home. .But it's youngsters like these two .that bear the brunt. .The danger, the separation and the worry. .So good luck to you both. .And let's hope this bloody war's over .by the time we all get together .to put the rubber stamp on it. - Hear! Hear! - So raise your glasses to Jean and Ken. - Jean and Ken. - All the luck in the worid. - Congratulations, love. - Thanks, Auntie Maud. .Come on. You act .like she's the only girl in the worid. .You ever hear of other fish in the sea? .Like that one right over there? .She's nice, but she's with somebody. .Chee. .Excuse me. Would you care .to take a little twirl round the dance floor? - I'm just having a drink. - The lady's with me. .She doesn't want to dance. .I didn't hear her. .Do you wanna dance with me? .Well, no, thanks. I'm with friends. - Why don't you... - You don't dance with Americans? - Look, shove off. - No, I don't dance with Americans. - We're having a good time. Leave us. - Don't dance? - I got cigarettes here. Want cigarettes? - No, thanks. .You take cigarettes from Americans. .Have a cigarette. - Have a couple of cigarettes. - That's gone in my drink. - Maybe some whisky... - We don't want any. - Drinks on me! .Bloody hell! . Come on, let's get outta here! .Come on, man! Move it! Go! Go! Go! .# I like your lips and I like your eyes - Whoa! What the hell's going on? - Try down here! .Yanks. Yanks. .Come on! .Round the back here! Further on! .Jean. - Jean. - Hey. - Hey. You OK? - Yeah. .Come on. We need a drink. Let's go. - Teddy! Teddy, open up! - Come on. - Teddy, we want a drink. - Come on, he's not here. - Teddy! - You're gonna wake everybody up! - Rise and shine, Teddy! - You're crazy! .What the bloody hell's going on? .Do you realise what time it is? .What the hell do you want? - We want a drink. - Oh, it's you two, is it? - Get us a half-and-half. - OK, lads. Half-and-half coming up. - Half-and-half, half-and-half! - Half's mine and half's the wife's. - Shit! - It's piss. - All right, Eddie! - Wait a minute! - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Take your hands off me. .Sounds to me .like you were looking for a fight. .Yeah, I was, sir. .You've been running .with the Moreton girl? .Yeah, I took her out a couple of times. .Nothing serious. .It's very easy to get involved .with women while you're over here. .But it's their country .and you gotta play by their rules, .even if you don't understand .them sometimes. Look, sir, I got drunk, made a damn fool of myself. No excuses. Confine them to the company area for a week. If you're caught fighting again, we'll take your stripes. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Take a hike. On platform one, London Euston train, calling at Stockport and London Euston. Nice to have something to laugh about, eh? - Ken... - Listen, Jean. The er... The garage. My dad says it's mine when it's all over. I'd like it. I can build something for us out of it, honest. I know you can. I know that. It would be pretty plain sailing, Jean, you and me. Maybe a bit too plain. If we come through it the same, at least we'll be certain, won't we? Just get back, eh? Just get back safe. Train at platform one is the London train calling at Crewe, Stockport and London. Passengers for North Wales, change at Crewe. Passengers for North Wales... Hey, lads, where you going? They're not as cheap as us in London. - I don't envy you that lot. - Shall I send you one for Christmas? No, thanks. I think I'd rather take on the flaming Japs. - Ken... - Now, you're not to worry, kid. This new lot I'm joining, they're no mugs. Crack troops. Better than scrubbing around in the infantry, eh? - There's something I want... I love you, kid. Be happy on your say-so. - I'm asking nothing, right? - Ken, please. - I'll be thinking of you every minute. - Ken, look after yourself. - Look after yourself. - Goodbye. - Don't forget to write. - Goodbye. Bye. Goodbye! - See you soon! - Bye! # I'll be seeing you # In every lovely summer's day # In everything that's bright and gay # I'll always think of you that way # I'll find you in the morning sun # And when the night is new # I'll be looking at the moon # But I'll be seeing you - Ice cream! Everybody likes ice cream! Ice... You want ice cream? We got ice cream. # I'll find you in the morning sun # And when the night is new # I'll be looking at the moon # But I'll be seeing you - Hey. - Hey. You having a good time? Ladies and gentlemen, we're just about to say goodbye to 1943, hello to 1944 in ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Happy New Year, Jean. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. # Should auld acquaintance be forgot # For the sake of auld lang syne # For auld lang syne, my dear # For auld lang syne # We'll take a cup of kindness yet # For the sake of auld lang syne # For auld lang syne, my dear # For auld lang syne # We'll take a cup of kindness yet # For the sake of auld lang syne # For auld lang syne, my dear # For auld lang syne # We'll take a cup of kindness yet # For the sake of auld lang syne - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. - Where were we? - In London. We went up specially. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. - Absent friends. - Absent friends. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. - I'll go. - No, it's all right, lvy. I'll get it. - 348. - Hi. Oh, hello. I just want to be the first to wish you a happy New Year. Happy New Year. Where are you, John? I'm in the office. Wish you weren't on duty. We should be celebrating somewhere. Listen, this was a very canny manoeuvre on my part. - Was it? - I scored points for volunteering tonight. Did you? Besides, if I can't be with you, I'd just as soon be alone. - Happy New Year, Helen. - Happy New Year, John. - Good night. - Good night. Excuse me. - Coming through. - Excuse me. - Here's your beer. - Any more fares, please? - Shut up! I'm just jingling his change. - Using this? No, love, take it away. I'm happy. Ooh! He's a big lad for a little lad, aren't you, chuck? - It's like sitting on a bloody stirrup pump. - You're disgusting. Hark at Prissy Knickers. You know what you got, Matt? A time bomb. She'll blow your bloody head off when she lets go. I can't wait. I got you a beer. Mind if I sit there? Hey, ain't that the white boy from the mess hall? Look at him play! God damn! I wanna dance. Get off! Gorgeous, ain't she? Oh, yeah! Come on, Charley! Move over, boy. I'm cutting in. Get him out of there. Get him off the floor. - Let them dance. - I don't think the lady wants that. - It doesn't matter. - I don't see no lady. - Let them dance. - Do you see a lady? - Cool it, OK? - He's drunk. All I see is a whore dancing with a nigger. - Get your hands off me. OK, nigger. Come on. Come on. Dance with me one time. That's all. Come on. Please, let's have some order. Please clear the floor. Stop it! God damn! I can whip you! I can whip you, white boy! I can whip you! I can whip you, white boy! Assholes! Hold him over the edge. We gotta make an impressin on you. We gotta learn you niggers to keep your place. Dance to this. I was only dancing with her. - What's that? - It's MPs. - Shit. Hey, hold it, man. Break it up up there. All right, you. - Never thought I'd be glad to see MPs. - He was looking for it. They'd have killed him for dancing with a white girl? Some places you just can't do that. - You believe that too, do you? - You saw what happened. Come on, let's get outta here. Come on, Mollie. - Excuse me, would anyone like to dance? - Do you want a dance? Come on. Yeah. Are you dancing? Will you just leave me alone? I'll leave you alone. Just keep walking. Just keep walking. Sorry, sir. No more orders after midnight. Residents only. - It's New Year's Eve. - It's New Year's Day. - We had an extensin till one... - I've been calling you for ten minutes. - Have you? - Yes. Aren't I a monkey? I didn't see you. Good night, Wing Commander. All the best. Don't forget us. I'm sorry, sir. It's the law, you know. - What law? - You have to be a guest. - Staying with us in the hotel. - To drink after hours. Happy New Year to you. - Good night, Mrs Moody. - Sleep tight, Colonel. - And a happy New Year to you. - And to you. All the best. - Let's hope it will be. - You got a room? If it were only up to me, I wouldn't... Pardon? - Do you have a room? - Matt, it's not necessary. - I think we can find you one. - Good. I'd like a room. Yes, sir. Single or um... - Single. Now, am I a resident? - Yes, sir. - Good. - What would you like to drink? I would like a double whisky to go with the single room and a sherry for the lady. Please. - My pleasure. - Thank you. You like getting your own way, don't you? I needed a drink. I left with you because I didn't want to make a scene. But if you do that again, as if you own me... - What would you do? - I danced with another man... You were making a point. He wasn't some other man. No, he's the kind you're allowed to beat half to death... The guy walked in there with his eyes wide open. He knew what he was doing. It was a black guy and a white girl. - He knew the score, Jean. - There isn't any score. This isn't Alabama or somewhere. - And you just stood there. - There was nothing I could do. You didn't even try. There we are. One key, one double Scotch and a sherry. I'm sorry, I can't let you have any more, sir. Whisky is short, you know. - Keep it. - Thank you, sir. Just call me if you require another. Look, Jean, you dig me out of goddamn Arizona, it wasn't a state 50 years ago, dump me in a town the Romans built, and you expect me to act the way you want me to act. I'd want you to act the same in Arizona. Yeah, you would. I don't know if I can change. I don't even know if I want to. We're different people, Jean. We may talk the same, look the same, but we just ain't the same. And I like it. - Why can't we leave it at that? - Because I don't want to leave it. I don't want to leave what we have. I can try. I can try, Jean. That's about all I can promise you. Well, finish your drink and take me home, please. OK. Kind of a shame to waste a good room. - Home. - Home. OK. Goodbye, Anna. Be a good girl. - Your train leaves Manchester Central. - I know, Mummy. You've told me. Take care of her. The train leaves Central. She'll be all right. - Stand clear! - Keep your chin up. We'll laugh about it all when Daddy comes home, you'll see. - Goodbye. - Have a good term, both of you. Be safe, giris. Grab your coat and hat. We're going on a trip. - I can't go anywhere. I've too much to do. - Give it a rest, will you? You work too hard. I took a day off. You should too. - Where are you proposing we should go? - I propose we should go to Ireland. - Why are we going to Ireland? - Top-secret. - Ever been before? - No. I've always wanted to. Come on, let's go! Top of the morning to you, buddy. How you doing? You got the usual? Nylons, bourbon, cigarettes? We're a little low on cigars. Somebody's short-changing us. - See you in six hours. - You got ten minutes. - What? - We gotta get out before it gets socked in. - Time for a quick drink. - My guys need three cases of bourbon. What else? All we need is a bar of soap. - What do you say, guys? - Hi, Captain. Not bad, huh? Top-secret indeed! You don't understand. Wars are not fought with bombs alone. What can I do you for, folks? - What are you gonna have? - I'd like a cup of coffee, please. And I'd like a bottle of cold beer. - Could I have a Coca-Cola as well? - You can have anything we've got. - Bring me some change. Dimes. - I'd love some chocolate. All of that stuff out there is just going to generals and war correspondents. All I'm doing is diverting a little of it to the common man. - Democracy in action. - Now you're cooking! - Cheers. - Good health. - You're not waiting to see if you've won. - Know the odds against winning? Last guy to beat that machine was Al Capone. - We flew that from Havana, Cuba. - How come there's no roulette wheel? We're working on it. - Give me some more. - I didn't know you were a gambler. Neither did I. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yeah! - Wow! Fantastic! - It's all in the attitude, you know. Welcome to America. Thank you. - For what? - For showing me Ireland. They're pouring in. Truckloads of 'em. - Mother. - What are you doing up here, Jean? - There's a shop to open up, love. - I'm going to ring the doctor. There's nothing the matter with me. My stomach's acting up, that's all. It's this wartime rubbish we've got to eat. Go and attend to the shop, would you, please, love? - There's thousands of them. - Yeah. Just think of all them chips. If we can get 2,000, tuppence a time, we'll make a fortune. - I'll do Thursday, Friday and Saturday. - You won't. I'll do Thursday, Friday, Saturday. You'll do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Welcome to England. There's a doughnut there and there's sugar. Tim! Tim! Tim, what has happened? I'm not going back. You... You won't make me, will you? - I won't make you. - I hate it so much. - Oh, darling, I'm so sorry. - I just couldn't take any more. What happened? Tell me about it. Second platoon, ready. Hit it! Third platoon, stand by. Go! Go get 'em! Come on, you pussies. On your bellies! Come on! - It's great, isn't it? - Move along! Keep your goddamn ass down! Keep down or you're dead! Titchwell, you've got the biggest ass I've ever seen! Move it! Move it! Trip the light fantastic! Move it! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Hey! - One, two, three, four! - Take cover. Quickly! Come on! Whoo! One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Two ounces of cheese. Now, jam, Mrs Shenton? - You got any shoe polish? - Yes, but you'll have to wait your turn. - What sort do you fancy? - Got any damson? - Yes. What they call damson. - Stockings? Brassieres? - You've come to the wrong shop. - I'll wait forever for you. - Here's your damson. - Got any picture postcards? - Can't you see she's busy? - Jean. - Anything with the name of this place? - What's the name of this place? - Jean! - All right, Dad! See what he wants. I'll deal with this lot. I'm in a right bloody mood for them. - Thanks. - You were next. What do you want? - The soup's boiling over. - Why didn't you turn it off? Your mother doesn't like me in the kitchen. - My mother's in bed. - Oh, no, she's not. Oh, Clarrie. Look, love, go back upstairs. - I thought you were having a rest. - With all that row going on? What have you got in there, love? A cattle market? - The shop's full of new Yanks. - Oh? - Who's serving? - Our Geoff and Mrs Shenton. I was going to bring this up to you. - Jean, where are the razor blades? - Coming. Take your pills. Oh, yeah. - Where you going? - Newport News. - Is that in America? - Sure is! - Take us! - Can we come? - Hey, kid, want an orange? - Yeah! Send me one first! You got it! Hey, kids, want a can of fruit? - Yeah. Any peaches? - You bet! Catch! Here it comes! Do you wish you were on that ship? So long, kids! I wish I was on it with you someday. Take you home and meet Dad. I think he'd like you. Wouldn't know what to make of you, but he'd like you. - Hey! - Hey! I think we should go to New York City first. What do you think? Yeah, we'll do that. We'll stay in a fancy hotel, see a Broadway show. We'll take a train all the way across the country. A sleeper. Mm. We'll go to... to Phoenix first. Then we'll take another train down to Tucson. I'll show you the desert in spring. Oh, Jeannie. The flowers on the cactus are so pretty. I'd like to see that. Good. We got a date. It's a long way. Yeah, it's a long way around the corner sometimes. I know that. But this is different. If only my mother weren't so ill. I couldn't leave home now, even if I wanted to. I think you can do anything you wanna do. I know horses, but I don't know about these bikes. Mother, what's the matter? What's happened? It's Ken. He's... been killed. His sister came round. They had a telegram at tea time to say he'd... been killed in action. I hope you're proud of what you've done to us. - Excuse me, ma'am? - That boy knew. Knew about you and your dirty little goings-on behind his back. He lived for you, Jean. Didn't want to come back. You know that, don't you? You as good as killed him, the pair of you. You'll have to live with that for the rest of your life. You're wrong. I'm sorry, I really am, but you're wrong. Just go away, son. The best thing you can do right now is just... go. - Jeannie? - I'll be all right. I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, yes. You'll see him tomorrow and the next day and the next. It's what you both hoped for, isn't it? Mother, you've no right to say that. I'm sorry. Jeannie, I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, Jean, I'm never going to see your children now. I'll never see them. I know that. I'm never going to set eyes on them, Jean. I'm not. Jean. Ken's dead. Did you know? - They came and told us. - Yes, I know. But I think you should go back to bed. It's very late. United States troops continue to pour into Great Britain. While Germany speculates on the time and places chosen for the second-front invasin of Europe, troops continue to mass in these islands in readiness for that invasin. Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. - Bags are in the boot. - Have you booked accommodation, sir? Yes, a room on the first floor. - Is it the first time you've been with us? - No, indeed. I'm glad to be back. - Have the car taken round. - Yes, sir. - Sir, have you booked a room? - Yes, I have. I'll be back for your luggage in just a minute. - How's the weather? Been keeping fine? - Very good, sir. This way, please. I was told by a good friend that this was a secluded place. - Would you like to stretch your legs? - Mm. It's an incredibly beautiful country, England. - This is Wales. England's over that way. - This must be the Welsh Sea. - Actually, it's the Irish Sea. - The Irish Sea? - That would put Ireland over there, huh? - Mm-mm. Well, nobody ever loved me for my sense of direction. - Do you remember Ireland? - Mm. I'll never forget it. What a beautiful girl. Beautiful country, beautiful giris. - Do you think he's American or British? - Does it matter? Well, I like to think that we get the pretty ones. Hm. - She might be a very nice girl. - Well, I hope so. - They might be terribly in love. - Could be. I'm feeling guilty. - About Peter? - About coming here in this way. Do you understand? Yeah. Perhaps I'm not a woman of the worid. Well... You'd think she'd have brought another pair of stockings. But he'll buy her another pair, won't he? I hope so. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. - Did you enjoy your lunch? - The fish was off. - The fish was off. - We should have had the vegetable pie. What is it? I was thinking what a terrific time we would have had if that kid of yours had been good at games. - Thank you for coming. - I was honoured. It was something I wanted to do. Matt, let's get away. Please. Take me away. OK. Thank you, sir. - What did you tell your mom? - I'm at my Auntie Maud's. Nice place she's got here. Are you sure? I'm sure. I've always wanted you. Oh, I want you. Don't leave me, Matt. Don't... Oh, please, Matt. No. What's wrong? What's wrong, Matt? Why did you stop? I don't know. I really don't know. You're scared. You just don't love me enough. Hey, don't. Don't. Don't cry. Don't cry. Want some gum? Go! - How are you? - Congratulations. Ohh! God bless you both! I'll be back in a minute. How are you? Don't forget, Danny. She's only on loan, you know. - Oh, aye, we want her back. - With a couple of American kids and all. It'll be your turn next, eh, Jean? Here you go. Come on, you drink. Come on, Danny, give your mother-in-law a nice dance. - You wanna dance? - No, you should dance with the bride. - You don't mind? - No. # You do the Hokey Cokey and you turn around # That's what it's all about # Whoa-o the Hokey Cokey Come on. Come on, Jeannie. # Knees bent, arms stretched, ra-ra-ra # You put your right arm in, your right arm out # You put your right arm in and you shake it all about # You do the Hokey Cokey and you turn around # That's what it's all about # Whoa-o the Hokey Cokey # Whoa-o the Hokey Cokey # Whoa-o the Hokey Cokey # Knees bent, arms stretched, ra-ra-ra # You put your left leg in, your left leg out Jean? Jeannie? Danny and Mollie got your telegram. - It meant a lot to 'em. - Was it a nice wedding? - Yeah, they seemed happy. - Mm. - Let's hope so. - Those two go together, don't they? - Happy-go-lucky. - She always had a heart of gold, Mollie. I thought I heard Jean run up. Is something the matter? I never meant to hurt anybody. I know that. It wasn't your fault. I've got nothing against you, you know. Whatever I may have done, I did to protect my family. All I want is Jean's happiness. Yes, ma'am. Take care of yourself, wherever they send you. Yeah. Yeah, you take care too. Try and get some rest. Leave her alone, will you, son? I think she wants a glass of water, Mr Moreton. Right. I'll go and see to her. - See you again, son? - It's hard to say, sir. I don't know. Oh, well. All the best, anyway. Why did you follow me home? Because I love you. It's just talk. It was all just talk, wasn't it? About you and me and Arizona. I didn't lie to you. I've never wanted anyone like I want you. - You gotta believe that. - Why? Why should I believe you? You know, when I was a kid I remember... I used to wake up in the night, scared. Not cos it was dark but because I didn't know where I was. That's how I feel right now. It's just too fast. Too much, too fast. I couldn't leave you here, with a kid, maybe... her upstairs, Ken. I don't know if I'm coming back. I couldn't do it. Other people do. I don't give a damn what other people do. - I got my own life to run. - I'm not trying to run your life. But I was ready to risk everything... and you weren't. No, I wasn't ready for that. Then you're not ready for me. No. Not like this, not yet. You'd better go. Yeah. Take care of yourself. That's what she said. - Nan, happy birthday. - Thank you. - It's carrot marmalade. - Oh, lovely. Thank you. What do you say? Oh, I thought I'd better return your books. You've been a wonderful lending library. I have some bad news. We can't loan you the truck any more. Oh, don't worry. We'll manage. That means you'll be leaving us. Well, you don't expect them to start without me, do you? I haven't got enough programmes for all the seats. - You might find a few more in the lobby. - OK. - How's it going? You're looking happy. - I am. Dad's coming home for a month. - We finally got a letter. - That's great. - I finally got one from Ann too. - Is she all right? Yeah, she's fine. The kids are fine. She's getting along a lot better with her family. And she wants a divorce. - Mm. I'm sorry. - My heart isn't broken. It's been coming for a long time. Peter's coming home on Saturday. Well, I think I might just miss him. I guess I gotta get back to camp. Try not to let anything foolish happen to you, won't you? Can we go from the beginning of the "English Suite" by Parry, please? One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Hey! - Get this to my husband, please. - I can't. Everybody's confined to base. Well, I'll see what I can do, lady. OK. That's it, bring it down, boys. Geoff! Golf course! The Yanks are leaving it! Come on. They're giving everything away. I can't. My mum's dead. Come on. It's your last chance. Goodbye! Thanks for everything. Here. You take good care of him, won't you? Chocolate. Who wants chocolate? Yeah! Five! Give me that dough! Betty Grable, you're mine! Move your goddamn asses and get on these trucks. Here, kid. Spend it for me. Oh, ta. - You going to split it with me? - No, I won't. - See you at the church. - You're most kind. Thank you. Take care, Annie. Has he not sent one? # The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended # The darkness falls at thy behest # To thee our morning hymns ascended # Thy praise shall sanctify our rest # As o'er each continent and island # The dawn leads on another day # The voice of prayer is never silent # Nor dies the strain of praise away # So be it, Lord, thy throne shall never # Like earth's proud empires pass away # Thy kingdom stands... One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Goodbye, lads. Good luck, lads. Clearing out, are you, you bugger? Can't you see this? Look, he's four months old. You've never been to see him once! Where's Ernie? Ernie! I've got to find Ernie! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! There! Hey, Danny! - Danny! - Down them steps. - Come on, Ted. - Thanks for coming, Mama. - Ta-ra, love. - Bye-bye, Mama. - Take it easy, Ted. - Goodbye. It were a lovely funeral, Jim. You did Clarrie proud. - My son Tim. - Anna's sorry she couldn't come. Jean, love. There's a parcel come for you. It's over there. Right, everybody.
