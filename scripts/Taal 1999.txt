I wish I could fly like those kites There will come this stranger who will take you away as his bride Every norm of society will I break... but I will not leave my father's house Defy destiny, you mustn't Remain quiet; say nothing Make no promises If you do promise... If you do make a promise, you must never break it Tarababu, the girls have grown up. You run a school on government sanction. Your brother too does nothing. You are surrounded by old debts. You sing in every wedding. Have you given although to your daughters' marriage? - What should I do? - You have so many official contacts. Use them. The land of many landlords is under dispute. Make a killing. Earn something. You always think like a broker. I've often told you, I'm an artist not a broker! I know my art and will earn without paying or receiving bribes. Eat a carrot. - Good day brother. - Live long. How are you? Hello. Has everyone reached safely? - Yes? - What's going on? We have a contract for 100 acres of land in Chamba. It's been 5years. We've run around but the land is still not in our possession. It's not like the old times. Everything changed when the government changed. We've already invested Now if the government doesn't let us embark on the project... We'll suffer a loss of6 billion! Elder brother has come. - Come here, my kids! - Big Daddy is here! - How are you? - Very well. - Hello, brother. - Hello, brother-in-law. - Did you like Chamba? - There's something about it. Yes. And you, Janki...? I won't say anything. This sister is happy where her brother is happy. Where is Manav? - He is in Delhi. - Why? - Didn't he come with you? - We did tell him to. But he asked us to carry on. Said he'd reach here on his own. - Alone. - That's strange. He's coming to India for the first time and will come here on his own! When he doesn't obey you, how would he listen to us? Said he'd see India on the way. The entire family is searching for you and you're standing here! Come on Keep the files in the car. We have to go to the commissioner. - Good morning uncle. - Good morning. Where were you? Any way now that you're here, work on this project. Your father has been waiting for you. How would Manav know how a father's soul pines for his son? Welcome, sir. It's all right. You apologized and I accepted. I know that, Your Highness. I know what you will now say. - What will I say? - You'll say, Manav my son... You should have thought of yourself if not Daddy. Such a long journey. You've come to India from London for the first time. You could have got lost. Somebody could pinch your pocket. Somebody could have kidnapped you. Then what would have happened? But nothing of that sort happened. Nothing happened, Dad. - To tell the truth... - I also know. What Your Honour is going to say. You are going to say... If you want to see India, don't travel in a helicopter. Sit in a second class railway bogey and see. Sit in ramshackle buses! Walk through stuff y lanes! Observe the Indian who is not successful in anything. Yet he smiles, sings, plays! And Chamba is the best. That is why I got you the latest Digital Floppy camera from Singapore. Take a look. Brownie... He missed you the most. Go on. He's very annoyed with you. Did you follow what the father and son spoke? - You keep quiet! - I am silent. Mad at me? I'm sorry I'm late. Won't you forgive me? Coming for a walk? No...? I'm leaving. Come along if you want. Shall we take a picture? Only the minister can approve this project. Who can make him do it? - Just one one, sir. His childhood friend. Tarababu. So call him over. - He's a very self-respecting man. I tried my best to do him in, but he wouldn't relent. Who ever you are... wherever you are... Wherever it be... You are the spring. My heart is restless My eyes glued to the path My heart is restless and my eyes are on the path Life is miserable... no music appeals So come over, my Love... Let's make music The rains have drenched me today Drowned I am... in my modesty I have this feeling, I can't understand I have lost something... but is it my heart? Don't be quiet; say something; sway with me... Walk in step whith me... I admit, I do not know you I also know that you do not know me That we may get to know each other... Come closer to my heart... for the sake of our hearts I'm in the same state as you are... Come, Let's share our state Hold the rope! Tie it to your waist. We'll pull you out. Help! Help! What a place to get introduced! Can I take a picture of yours? Just buy vegetables! Uncle... Brownie, have you ever seen such a scene? Neither is this the way to behave nor is this civilised behaviour! - You'll have to deal with me! - What is the matter? What is the matter! His son was falling off the mountain. My girls rescued him. The cheek of him! He took their pictures! Brigadier sir, if your daughter is playing in the rain... Bathing... and a strange boy secretly takes her photographs... What will you do? - I'd shoot him! - That's what I'm here for! As if he's civilised! Gate crashes uninvited into a party! And with a stick in hand! Isn't that like a bully? Madam! You're in Chamba! You maybe great in your own homes. - Don't you dare oppose me! - Sir, Tara... I am the second brother of this family, Deep Mohan. If our child has made a mistake, we apologise with folded hands. Bring your son here. When the elder of the family are apologizing, forget the anger. Today is our son's birthday. Won't you bless him? - Yes, fine... - Son, greet uncle. - Hello uncle. - Give him a kiss. Come on... Live long. But you must explain to your son. If he has taken any unflattering picture, he must return it. - Now I'll take leave. - Please attend the party. No, I must move along. He left his stick here. - Good day. I'm Manav Mehta. - Good day. Your stick... You left it at our home Yes... l... - So you're the prince who... ...erred by taking pictures. I've come to you to apologise for it. You seem a good sort. Return the pictures you'd taken to us. Here you are. What in the world is this? I want the round thing you put in the camera... reel...? No, this is a floppy. I have this camera wherein you put in a floppy... - It doesn't have the reel system. - What? I'll take a picture of yours. Forget it... You may keep this. We won't understand computers. - But henceforth you... - There's no need to take pictures. You are such beautiful people that your picture is in my heart. May I take leave? Good day. He's a wonderful man. These artists are made that way. Emotional... - Tarawas angry with us. - But Deep handled him very well. But keep in mind, the Goddesses of wealth and learning don't get along. They will gel and make wonderful music. - How is that? - I have an idea. Take us to Tarababu's house tomorrow morning. Then watch me. - This is him. - Good day. Good day. You... I am the eldest brother of this family. Jagmohan. And Manav's father. We've come to apologise for Manav's impertinence. Good Lord! Don't mention it. I didn't realise the matter would be dragged so far. I never imagined such wealthy people could be so humble! It was last night that Rambhajan said you were so rich yet simple. Do you know this man lunches with the Prime Minister of every nation? Isn't it? And I've heard your picture appears on front pages? How ever famous a disciple of the Goddess of wealth maybe... He's still below the disciples of the Goddess of Knowledge. No, I'm just a petty folk singer. It is this simplicity of yours that brings us to you. I am really ashamed to have come to your house and misbehaved. No. I'll accept your apology only when you accept our little gift. Gift...? Lift it. Today you have given a soul to our ashram. Son... It is today that God has come to my home. - I am Santram. - I see... I am Brijmohan... Raise your right hand... Bend forward. Right hand down. Both hands down. Feet together. So what were we doing? ...Yes, yoga. Raise both hands. Bend forward. Bend fully. Raise yourself. Lower your hands. Coming. - You take over till I return. - Okay. Father... what is it? Come here, my dear. I must introduce you. They have brought us a statue of Mother Saraswati from Bombay. She is my only child, Mansi. She is single but scolds me a lot. Hello, dear. I forgot to introduce you to Balwant. She is my sister-in-law. And these are my disciples. We live together and make wonderful music. - That's well written. - The beat is the life of song. The beat creates music. The rhythm of beat gives life. It gives rise to love. - That's wonderful! - My daughter composed it. - Mansi... - Really? - Have you composed this? - Yes? Yes. - Yes? - I have a request. We're hosting a party tonight. Important friends of mine from Delhi will be attending. I'd like you to come. Your presence will add a feather to our cap. How can I refuse you? But you have to attend the wedding of Mania. Oh yes. You can go there and Mansi and I will go to their house for dinner. This is Mr. Jindal, the CEO of Zee TV. Tarababu sings beautifully. I'd like you to showcase his talent to the world through your channel. Aunt, how much does my balloon weigh? Your balloon... weighs... The blast scared you? So you were behind this prank? No, the kids. By the way, you may consider me a child. I can see that. This...? He is my heart. My friend, Brownie. Say Hello. Don't you have any friends? No. My relatives are my friends. I too have enough of them. I have a grandmother who lives in Bombay - Would you like to meet her? - Will you do that? Hold him. Just a minute. Don't go away. I too will get one picture taken with the big boss. I'll be privileged to be photographed with you. Aren't you Tarababu's daughter? Made friends with the dogs as soon as you entered? That's called a smart girl! Sorry, I took awhile. He's building relations. You must come to Bombay and stay with us. My second cousin stays in Bombay! She's a reporter. The way she speaks! From Bombay. Look at this. She's my grandma. She's my only friend who truly knows me. - Have you seen Manav? - Yes. - Where is he? There he's gone! You teach yoga very well. Will you teach me? Sure but... you will have to become my student. Definitely. Isn't it a good band? - Will you help me? - Yes. My friend, Mania is getting married. Dad dragged me here. And you want to attend your friend's party? Yes because Shanno, ... everyone is there. Will you drop me there? - I'll come to see you. - To see me? Why? To learn yoga. - Sure. - Promise? - Yes. - Sure? Not sure! Mansi! We thought you won't come. - We've been waiting for so long! - Yes. - How could I not come? - You will have to sing today. - Isn't it? - Yes. - You sing. - You first. - No, you sing. - You sing, I won't. - You must sing. - Let's go! To what end be death if not for love? And what is life without love? Sweeter than sweet is love; And sourer than the sourest is love A promise that is kept... love; a tie between lovers... love To what end be death if not for love...? And what be life if not for love? On earth, is love; in the Heavens is the Lord Everything else is transitory between Love and God Say a hundred things, should you wish... The meaning still remains the same More beautiful than God... is love And God is more beautiful than anything else More precious than any gem is love; our only desire... love Who has ever known what love is And yet, everyone knows what love is It's an unknown place, the beloved's home A long journey for a small life... whoever has known love? A balm for those suffering? Is it really love or God Himself? You have only heard of love And I have actually loved A garden of roses... love; strewn with thorns too, is love What's going on? Did you see that? Let's go back. Remember last night's promise? You said you'd teach me yoga. I'm here. Raise your hand. Raise your hands high. Look, this will never happen. And this will not happen. What won't happen? You well know what I mean. - We're two different people. - Yes. So? We are different. And people do meet. Have you ever seen the mountain meet the valley? - The earth and the sky... - Do you love me? - What? - Love? Listen... hear me out and understand me well. Girls from our family do not fall in love. Their circle only consists of their parents and brothers. - I understand. - You are different. I am different. I shoulder the responsibility of my Dad. Only I understand the sorrow within his heart. And I don't want to be responsible for giving him sorrow. - Absolutely. - That's it. So please believe that there's nothing between us. How can I do that? There is. - What? - That we're falling in love. - You are very stubborn. - I'm also truthful. So hear my honest answer too. I do not love you. I can't believe it. Because I refused out right? - You got scared. - Of whom? Of me. I might cheat you and run away. Look... don't try to cast a spell on me. So I have the capability. Now I'll never meet you! Never! Come on... wear this one. Hail the Honourable Minister! Sir... - Sir... - Long live Ramprasad! For the development of Himachal Pradesh, Mehta and Mehta Company... And his family are co-operating with us. First of all we'd like to thank Tarababu. Who is a childhood friend of mine. Tarababu is the pride of Chamba. He holds on to his Ideals even when living with the poor. Son... Manav... Cold drink? See that girl standing there? - With the grey scarf? - Yes. - Take this to her. This was possible thanks to you. Soft drinks have been sent for you. We don't want it. Excuse me... - What happened? - Give this to me. - You take another one. - Why? - I'm thirsty! Hold on. What are you doing here? Come and meet the minister. I'll be back in a minute. I asked you to come to the stage thrice. Couldn't you hear me? - Come on. - Yes. Come on. Now have you understood? Yes, I've understood. We'll all leave for Bombay tomorrow. I knew you'd come. And that you'd come here. Now tell me that you don't love me. Say it. Go on. Why are you silent? It's nothing. I know what you're thinking. What? The same that happens in normal Hindi films. A city bred boy comes and falls for the mountain girl. Then he leaves her and goes away. Then he never returns. But... this will never happen. This is my truth not a film. It's my life. Of course there will be resistance. I'll have to fight my family. And you with your family. But it will work out. I must now leave. Manav, listen... I was embroidering this for you... But this is mine! Yes but now it's ours. See... What does Manavsi mean? It means... Like Manav. Like Manav. Thank you very much. Do meet us if you come to Bombay. Yes and you must take care of your health. Understood brother? You too. - Okay... - Good bye. - See that temple? - Yes. It is said that the God of that temple grants everyone's wish. I don't go to temples. I've never been to a temple. I won't stop you if you want to go there. - I don't understand. - When I was 11, my mum died. She always told me one thing... The Lord resides in man's heart. Here. In his subconsciousness. After all what is God? A belief, the truth. Every man sees him in some form. Some in a book, others in idols. Some in the flame of a lamp. I see God in myself. That's all. Your love too is a belief in me. Yes, it's just a trust. To remind you of that trust, I got you something from the temple shop. It's cheap. Made of stones. But 100% true. Come. Let's tie it around your neck. Who gave this necklace to you? Who gave it?? You love your Dad a lot, don't you? - You love him. Don't you? - Father, wait... Before you say anything... Or misunderstand, I want to tell you the truth. - Manav gave this to me. - Why? Because he loves me a lot. And you...? I too... Are you in your senses? Do you know who he is? They are very wealthy people. We have nothing in common! But Manav and I do. - Not with those rich people. - This is impossible! This is impossible! This is Manav from Bombay. - Father... - What's wrong? Why do you sound scared? Is the situation tense? Father... Mansi... So father has found out? Yes... All right. Give the line to him. Father, it is Manav. I'm sorry I couldn't meet you before leaving. I wanted to talk to you. But I couldn't. I'm glad you found out that I... Are you listening? Yes. Go on. I wanted to say the promise I made to Mansi before I left... ...that is firm. I will marry her. I've committed myself to her. And I will keep it. You are worried because you are her father. Scolding her... in your shoes I too would probably do the same. Don't worry. If God is in your heart, the truth is resolute. Everything will be fine. Your Dad is an artist. Who can understand love better than an artist? Call me later. Where have you been? I've been calling you for so long. - But you don't answer. - Another twist in Manav's love story Mansi's father has found out that Mansi loves me. I mean we're in love. Forget about love and look at this photograph. She's the girl Deepmohan and Shaku chose for you. But I told her father clearly. And I'll stand by my commitment. But Jagmohan has something else planned for you. This girl belongs to the Kurasia family, Nishita. I too approve of her. The girl has class. After hearing my story too, you show no sympathy. It's pack up for all these girls. I'll have sympathy when you obey me. You will have to marry the girl I approve of. No, grandma. This is not fair. You're putting me in a tight corner! There's this drama going on and you're initiating another one! You're my grandma. How can you do this to me? First take a look at the picture. Don't fall in love. Rise, my child. - What are you doing here? - The girls are worried about you. I went to call Prabha. - Bombay? - Bombay. I have just one sister Prabha in Bombay. Yes. What did she advise? What will she say? She said bring Mansi over to Bombay. She herself will talk to her. Then she will find an answer to this problem. She also said to come straight, not to inform brother Jaggi. I'm worried. Will you go to Bombay? I can't spend one night here. I will have to go to Bombay. I'm glad you came to Bombay under this pretext. - Where is Ashwin? - I divorced him. - Why? - He deserved it. But I have something from him. My Tunno! After listening to your story... I have reached one conclusion. You must go to Manav Mehta's house at 7 in the morning. And shock them. I said sir does not meet anybody today. Tell him I have come from Chamba. I'm a close friend of his! I don't have orders to telephone or wake up anyone before 9.30. Take a seat on this bench. I'll call at 9.30 or 10. But we won't sit here!! I'm his friend! Only his friends come here. Sit down. Take a seat. Father, let's sit. A Tarababu has come from Chamba. - Make him sit out. - All right madam. Come and sit here. Sit down. - We won't sit here. - Why? Can I call up and talk to them? To the master or their son? The master is sleeping and his son is not at home. He has gone to his grandma's house. Since last night. Sit. Come here. Do you know him? Yes and he too knows me. Do you see? He knows us! I'll set you right later! Shake hand, pal. I'm sure he'll go and tell Jagmohan. Lock him in the room! Creating a nuisance since morning! I'll go and talk to him. Deep... Go inside. - We have come. - Tarababu, when did you come? When? We're here since 7.30 AM! That rascal of a guard! Didn't he tell you? We've been sitting for 6 hours! And tell me where is Jagmohan? He's getting dressed. Special guests have come from London. He meets them over lunch. Please be seated. I'll inform him. Make them sit in the shade. Come and sit here. Would you like some tea or water? - Get us some water. - Right. You've made them sit here? They are not non entities. He is Tarababu from Chamba. A dear friend of brother. He's come from a distance. Make them sit in the lounge. In air conditioned comfort. - You came without an appointment. - Sister, we... You've broken the rules of this family In this house, no one can meet anyone without an appointment. - Yes, madam? - Seat them inside. Didn't I tell you to call them up? Did you hear what she said? What appointment? Did they take an appointment to come to our house? What nonsense! - No, father. Let's go. - We will leave, my child. We will leave but now we'll see this drama through. You people who perform dramas in every street... Have you come here to perform for or watch the Mehta family? You have adorned your daughter well to come here. To ensnare the prince of this castle! - Sister... - I am not a sister to pimps like you! It would be best for you to return home. I won't leave without meeting Jagmohan. He's having lunch with the English What will you do there? Wag your tail like a dog? Let Jagmohan come. I'll tell him, the dogs he's tied outside... He should tie this English bitch along with them! You called me a bitch! Throw them out of the house! - Brother... we've been... - Stop right there! Stop right there. He called me a bitch! Uncle, did he say it or not? - He did... - That's it! First you drop in uninvited. Then you call me sister-in-law... A bitch! Yes, I called her a bitch! Because your sister-in-law behaved like a bitch. Yes, Tarababu from Chamba. Your friend, you brother! You too may say something against me if you wish. Go ahead! You're not in the right state of mind. Go home now. We'll talk in the office tomorrow. - Finally you too said it! - Yes I did. Didn't even offer us water! Didn't offer his pal a seat! Terrific! You came to our house as an important guest. With a statue of Mother Saraswati! Lofty talks! Artists are a form of God! Greater than us, the wealthy! You are a very sentimental man. We call every man in a band, an artist. They come wagging their tails once you show them a note. Saraswati means nothing. You are sycophants of wealth! You drool at the sight of money. Only talk big! If you want to be compensated for your work, sure... - And get lost! - You are right. And the fact is that I want to be compensated. And I want it right now. Tell me how much money you want. Don't touch me, you rascal! You toyed with my emotions! Now I got paid for it! What are you doing? What is going on here? You hit my father! Do you know what you've done! Nobody dared to say one insulting word to him! And you slapped him! - Son... - You have turned mad! Go away from here. Lest I raise my hand too! Leave! Raise your hand. Beat my father. He did not show respect to my Dad. Your father has honour and my father has none? You are all alike. Only wealthy. - Rich statues. - Do you want to leave? Then leave. But I can't let anyone insult my father or family. My father means everything to me! Do you understand? Yes, I understand. And now you too understand this. Here is your love! And here is your gift! What will I tell Prabha? Father... You don't cry. Let's sit there, father. Sit here. My heart is restless I eagerly watch the path My heart is restless and I eagerly look at the path... Life is miserable... no music appeals to me So come tome, my Love... Let's make music together Let's make music together I knew they would treat you this way. But how could I give sight to your blind love? I had just one way that you see for yourself. The world has really gone places. Wasn't it better that everything happened so fast? Life comes in chapters. One ends and the other begins. - Where did you find this? - Father had it. Whose card is this? We met this man in a stadium. - You met him? What did he say? - Nothing. He recognised me. He came up to me and asked if I was Tarababu. He had heard a lot of my songs on the radio. - My photo had appeared in the paper... - Last month? He had seen that. He was praising me a lot. He asked me to come to his studio at 11 on Monday. - Then? - I said I'd come. - But who goes! - Brother! Do you know who this man is? For me, he's a thief. Plagiarizing my song! This is Vikrant Kapur. The top star of huge television industry. Go and wear your clothes first. Such a big man invites you to his studio and you want to go to Chamba! You should go to his studio at least once! Who knows what door fate might open for you! The truth is that Vikrant has 4 eyes, not 2. Two in front, two at the back. That is how he sees everything. Go there. He must have seen you with the rear eyes and called you. Go ahead. Good luck. I'm Tarababu's cousin. I recognised him the moment I set eyes on him. I compose my music myself. But in every corner of this country is hidden folk talent... ...which my company discovers. You sing your songs for Jalandhar radio. But we hear them here. We record and remix them. By remix I mean you catch a song composed by anyone. Or steal it. Then add 4 new instruments to it. Record and remix them and lay your stake to it. Art is art whether it be yours or others'. The Goddess of Wealth should be with you. Tip-toes all the way. Sir Sad bud! How are you, sir? You're rarely seen! The papers are full of news about you! Your name is embedded in my heart! Sure you must meet me. It is your studio, sir! Right now I'm in a board meeting. Call me in half an hour. If this scoundrel calls up again, tell him I'm not in the studio. You must be thinking what a fraud I am! But this is the language of our business. We talk with love at our enemies and fight with friends. They are new so they don't understand the tongue of Bombay. Don't you speak? What can I say? Say that again. What can I say? What can I say? What a phrase! Good voice too. Do you sing? She sings better than me. - And do you dance? - She's a graduate in dance. And song. I was right in thinking and my guess was right. This is my friend, confidante, secretary, manager, partner... And the main executor of this company, Banerjee. Sutarbhai has come from Baroda for the charity show. I'll deal with him now. Tell him we're booked all year. One show will cost 50 lakhs. No charity. We'll work only when he pays up. This charity business is a fraud! They make money and ask us artists for concessions! I have told him, Tarababu. I'm a man of the 21st century. Whether it's a marriage, party or award function... Pay up and I'll make music! We artists are priceless! I'm very happy to know you respect artists so much. I wish to respect you with all my heart. But honestly, emotional people scare me a lot. You must first learn to be practical. - That's what I tell them. - For example, take... You've always remained poor and will always remain poor. You sang in the mountains and we made remixes and earned millions! Take a look. This contains songs composed only by you! I'm trying to tell you, join our company. Write songs for us, Mansi can sing... And be a model dancer in our shows. Begin a new life. Simple. Give us 2 days to think. Sure, think it over. You may reject our accept our company offer. Thinking like this won't help. You are a girl of the 21st century. Simpering away at home won't help. You've seen what language the men of today use. Think with your head. What will you achieve by returning to Chamba? The burden of marrying 2 sisters? A heavy with debt school of your Dad? How will you yourself live? How? How??? I have no idea of your past. But it's very essential for you to experience pain, sorrow for success. You also seem to have suffered quite a bit. I have suffered like the hero of Hindi films... ...whose father left his mother when he was a child. My mother sewed and got me an education. Taught me music. And then she died. The same sad story. This is my mother. She left behind some principles of the 20th century. Principles of the 20th century. Sacrifice is supreme. Do good and forget about it. Do your duty, don't expect rewards. After completing BA, I worked on these I deals for 5 years. What was the outcome? I starved, had no food to eat. I used to play this rattle. And Banerjee would take photographs. Then our life took a new turn. We met a man called Jaidev uncle. He gave us these 7 tenets of the 21st century. He said Kapu, change these old tenets. Change into a modern man. The first rule is love remains healthy with give and take. First do good to yourself. All efforts are useless unless backed with expectation of reward. What is the profit? What is desire? What's the result? Shop dressing is more important than honesty. Envy is essential to win in any competition. Jealousy! Greed is necessary to become rich. Cut the others down to size in order to be one up. I followed them for 7years and... ...turned into Vikrant Kapur from Kapu. You mean you really turned out to be practical. This is Bombay. Everything is a show. It's called showmanship. The decoration is publicity and the dressing is marketing. Now you will see where we take Mansi. Only if she clears the test. Tell her the company contract rules. You have to give a video test and sing. - What's the other condition? - The other condition is... You can't get married during this period. - Pardon...? - No marriage, no friendship, nor love or romance. We sell pain not buy it. Manav, at least listen to what Deepmohan is saying. He may say anything but the staff told me everything. Shaku Aunt is at fault. And at issue is the honour of the family. I see. So you will teach us civilised behaviour! Absolutely. How should a wealthy man behave with a poor man... You have to learn that. The Tarababu who was treated as a king in Chamba... He was made to sit with the dogs. The one they said was Saraswati incarnate... was called a slave of Laxmi? father and daughter sat in the sun. Somebody who was humiliated in this manner... What would he do if not boil over with anger? What is your point? In 2 days Daddy will return from London. You will have to clearly tell Dad of the way you behaved with them. What do we tell brother? Somebody slaps him and he should quietly bear it! If breaking a glass or raising your voice proves the truth... Then I have broken 7 glasses. That implies my truth is 7 times stronger than yours. I'll explain the real truth. When a 21 year old boy gets blinded by love... this is just the way he behaves. Then he wants to change not just his but the fate of the family. We won't let you change the fate of the entire family. Fate has changed. Your Manav now belongs to another. Take a look if you'd like. This is Manav's Mansi. She will be the daughter-in-law of this family. And someday all of you'll be taking a family photograph around her. That's my promise to you. To you. You and you. Grandma, may I leave? Oh beloved... I understand it now... I understand the feeling You were confused earlier; your predicament is now solved She's got something. She's good. Yes, sign the contract. Hey man! Man, I'm talking to you. You are in front of my heroine. Please move away. You... Slightly loose nut. Mister, we're working. Please stand behind the public. Look, I must meet Mansi. Do you know her? Yes, very closely. How is she related to you? Beloved. Pardon? Just a minute. Do you see that boy? He says he wants to meet you. You're his beloved. No sir. Neither am I anyone's beloved nor do I want to see him. - Shall I tell him that? - Yes sir. Brother, she says she neither wants to meet you... Nor does she know you nor is she your beloved. I have to meet her. Meet her after the shooting. I'm acting like a gentleman. You too act like one. Please go there. Let us work. Please. Mansi, stop. I can guess your sorrow. I have made a mistake. I respect you even more after finding out the truth. Do you know why? Because a girl who holds the honour of her parents higher than her love... Sacrifices her love for their honour... Only that girl can be the wealth of a family. She can be a good wife to a man. I've come to apologise to you. Your father should apologise to my father! Because he slapped him? No, that was wrong. Absolutely wrong. I respect my father just as you respect yours. The job is done! Vikrant says the contract will be signed today. Today is an auspicious day. I've read the contract. Just sign it. You are Vikrant's heroine for three years from today. Sign here. You threw these in my house. I'll string them into a necklace once again. And you will have to wear it. If God resides in me, I am honest... You yourself will come running into my arms someday. You... On your own. - So, met her? - Yes. Decision taken? - Yes. - What? She signed you on and resigned me. She turned you down? Yes, she turned me down. Look friend, I don't know your story but I do know this... The girls and boys who enter the world of stardom hang in the sky. They never come down to earth. You probably don't know the girl. She will come and to me alone. And you will send her to me. - Me...? - Yes, you. You will send her as a businessman. One thing is sure, I love your self-confidence. Is what you said to Deep true? Absolutely true. These people humiliated Tarababu and Mansi. That was wrong. That is why he humiliated you. That too was wrong. But... it is also true... Yes, carry on. I love Mansi. I've promised to marry her. What will you do now? Will you leave home? Call us names? No. No... that will never happen. Something that sullies your family or your name... I will never do that. No scenes, no pettiness. I will neither leave you nor elope and marry Mansi. That is my promise to you. If I refuse to let you marry Mansi...? You won't do that. The love of Mansi and me bloomed under your web. It grew. The only difference is that you loved Tarababu like a businessman... And I loved Mansi like a man. Like a human being. This won't happen. Mansi will not come to this house. No... All right. If my love is not true... She will never come. But if God resides in my heart... If I am honest... If my love is true... You yourself will bring Mansi to this house. You... Not anymore... No, not anymore, my Love... I can't take it no more The nightingale sings in the forests... A fire breaks out... I don't care A snake bites me... I wouldn't care Even if the skies fall... I wouldn't care I wouldn't care if any calamity happened But I'd never be able to bear the pain of my broken-heart Come now, my beloved Do come now, my beloved The heart sees no reason Every moment passes by... but the heartache remains Even if he has forgotten everything, I do remember so much The plant that the vines engulf, withers away Where it hoped for roses... it is left with thorns No medicine, no prayer can ever save you from love Love is unfaithful Without it, however, you are lonely Do not give your heart, they advise; and they give their hearts away They steal your sleep; and keep you awake all nights Happiness and cheer, they are for someone else No promise, no effort works then This is one of the worst afflictions An extra-ordinary story of special success of an extra-ordinary girl. ...Of Mansi Shankar, whom you will meet at the MTV party tonight. We're here in search of a star. The search ends right here. The day I saw Mansi, in 5 minutes I had understood... She will be the greatest star of the world! I watched MTV but never dreamt my song would be on top of its' charts. Then what did you dream about? That was another dream. MTV has given us this honour today. Twice the amount of blood is pumping through my veins! Manav is here. Now six times the amount of blood is flowing in my veins! Brother... - You and here? - Yes, I'm here. - How come? - I came just as you came. Are you too a Ken star winner? Not yet but maybe I'll be lucky. May I talk to you for a minute? Frankly pal, I like you a lot. I too am fond of you. But Your Highness, Your Majesty... MTV has thrown such a grand party in our honour. And you landed up again to ruin it in the form of a lover! Do you like this? Not a form of lover. I am a lover. - Whose lover? - Hers. Look, this is a business party. It's the first day of her success. That is why I have come. Like a gentleman I request you to sneak away from here. I told you Mansi belongs to me and I belong to Mansi. That is why I have come. But she refuses to acknowledge you. Sir, she's in a temper! You do fight in love. So you are fully convinced that she will return to you? Yes and you will send her to me. He is crazy. Show him the way out. Tonight is for Mansi Shankar! And the Chief Guest tonight is... The only son of the Chairman of Mehta and Mehta Company. He won the maximum awards in his college in London. The MTV guys invited him here as Chief Guest. Where are the drinks? You don't want to be this. You are Manavsi. Say it. Say, you don't love me. No. But don't live this false life. Shall I leave? I'll wait for you. Now my blood is flowing 12 times faster! Take a meter reading. - Your beloved was saying... - I don't want to hear it. Whatever it be, he has class. I met Prabha. She told me all about Manav. You should make friends with him. What's the harm in it? Parents are always the villains in love. He's in love with you. Enough! Stop it! It's very important that I remind you at this point... According to your company contract, no artist of your company... ...has the right to make friends, fall in love or get married! You are raising obstacles in my work and career with your talk! I don't like working like this! I don't want to work here! I don't want to work! She's a wounded lioness. Why do you trouble her? In today's world you find arrogant girls not self respecting ones. Please give the phone to Mansi. There's a call for you. From Vikrant's studio. Tell him I don't want to work. I don't understand what you mean. Our company is launching a new type of bra. Like this. And you want a beautiful model for the advertisement of this bra. That too from my company. - Yes. - And you only want Mansi. - Yes. - Hoardings will be put up all over the city. Right. We can pay you any price you demand. A crore... what ever you say. Do you know that Mansi is a singer? - Yes. - And she's a dancer. - Yes. - She's an artist. A star. Today stars stand nude for money. That is right. And the money is good. You are such a fool! You get such foolish clients. They don't realise Mansi comes from a good family. She won't do this kind of modelling. Either you're a fool or they are. These days girls from good background do model like this. Then my advice to you is... A model better than Mansi is sitting right next to you. What? She's beautiful. And healthy. An English madam! - Mehta and Mehta company... - I know. If they belong to good families let them learn to respect others. You deal with these vile people. I have enough of work. We sell art not the honour of girls. I don't think you have the sense to judge men. The wrong is right in your eyes and the right is wrong. Tarababu composed the song and sent it through Shaukat. - Why didn't he come? - He's not well. - And Mansi...? - She refused to come. I called her6 times in 4 days! And she doesn't want to come! You are such a fool! You are my enemy! You love to humiliate me! - What have I done? - Why did you call her 6 times? Don't you know what Vikrant Kapur is? Many girls like her came and went. Just because I smiled at her, she thinks she is Miss World! She thinks she is a star! Tell Tarababu I don't want his song! So you are hurt? Who can hurt me? Who? I am a tough man! Tough! Yet he doesn't' appear as tough today, isn't it? - Where do you find me weak? - From here. Your heart. - What about the heart? - Weak in the heart. For the first time you speak from the heart. Don't you really miss her? - Don't bore me. Go away. - What's the harm I being honest? You are missing her. What happened? What shouldn't have happened. - Love? - No, hatred. - Hatred? - You mean no song today? Today's session... I am... Mansi. What you did wasn't right. I'll come back tomorrow. I do not know what occurred tome I drank in the name of love I lived it up... I drank in the name of love O devotee of love... I drank in the name of love In a moment, I lived through centuries I drank in the name of love In a moment, I lived through centuries I drank every drop there was... In a moment, I lived through centuries I drank, oh yes, I drank in the name of love A devotee of love, you are... A swaying devotee, you are... You have drunk in the name of love... What was it that occurred to you? You have drunk in the name of love What was it that occurred to you...? I have drank all there was; I've lived centuries in a moment What have you under taken this ritual for? What have you invited this affliction for...? I saw this woman somewhere... and waves whipped up a frenzy My heart went out to her... I renounced the world... when the feeling over came me I renounced the world when I fell in love He didn't get to know; my scars remained on my heart Not once did I cry out in pain; so what is it that occurred to you? I drank all there was In a moment, I lived through many centuries Manav left this house and has gone to stay in father's cottage across. That's fine. Grandpa's cottage will now be a lover's cottage. What do you want to say? Vikrant likes Mansi. He has sent these bangles through Banerjee. - Meaning? - Meaning? He's asking for Mansi's hand! - But... - No buts! You don't find such boys! I mean like Vikrant! - But... - Vikrant is a villager at heart. Like us. Mansi will be happy with him. I can guarantee that he will love her a lot. - But this hurry... - Finally it's your wish! If you want to keep her home, do so! Kick good fortune in the face! Think of Mansi. Once she's married, she'll forget her sorrow. What are you saying? I once gave you the right to decide your fate. Didn't I? This time you have to give in to me. Lord Shiva gave you success not me. A father's success is finding a suitable groom for his child. Look my dear... who knows when life will cheat on you. Before I die I want to see you married to a good boy. Don't... don't turn me down. I hold you by oath. Yes, I sent this proposal through Banerjee. Will you really be able to love me? Do you know some people fall in love and get married? And some get married and fall in love. Away from my heart, which path has she taken? Every path leads to my heart Not before me... You are not here, before me... but that's a different story With me, however... you are with me You are away from me; yet, you are not separated You are angry with me... but you are not unfaithful It's your hand I hold in mine It's only in my hands that your hand is You are with me. Always Fortunate are those that die at the hands of their beloved. You seem very happy. Sanjay Prabhu from India's top company BPL just called me. He says they want to send us to Canada. For MTV International Awards. You've brought me so much of luck! It's caught fire? - You can't go there! - My cottage is on fire! - Can't you see? - I said, you can't go! No, son. You can't go ahead. - But my belongings... - Son of Romeo! You can't go! That's my cottage. I have very precious things in there. - Forget this! And come with me. - But we're told to put this out. To Hell with your cottage! First we have to save the goods worth millions lying in the go down. Carry on with your work. I'm absolutely fine. I burnt my hand a little. The rest is safe. I had no Idea that the fire would be flaming inside. Everybody else was trying to save the go down. But I too had some precious things. My violin, the digital camera you gave me. My computer. Doctor Dilip said I can go home tomorrow. I can play tennis. I'll play tennis with you. I haven't played tennis with you for many days. One who is not accustomed to lying... He should never lie. I am your father. What is it? You can't enter without signing the security register. I will go in! You can't stop me. He came in without telling us... He didn't even sign the register... He says he's your friend. You may go, Gopal. He is our guest. Welcome, Jagmohan. Chhaya, get something cold for our guest. Today is the day we worship Mother Saraswati. You do know Mother Saraswati? Don't embarrass me. I have come to apologise for my mistake. I've come to ask for my son's life. - I come to ask for Mansi's hand... - Don't say it! Don't say it! When I had come to your door to plead for my daughter's life... No... no. No. How would you know how hurt my child was by your behaviour? How many nights she has cried! How many nights! And now... Now she belongs to somebody else. - Don't say that. - It is the truth! This is the truth, Jagmohan! She has gone to Canada with Vikrant Kapur. And they will get married when they return next week. Such a huge stadium! Thousands of people! Singers from all countries have come, Mansi! Such a tough competition! What will happen? It'll be fun. Vikrant is confident that you'll win the first prize. - Yes? - Did you read Manav Mehta's news? Are you sorry? Go and do your job. The wealthiest man of London, Jagmohan's son... ...jumped into a raging fire to save a scarf given by his beloved. Nobody knows who the beloved is. Why are you telling me this news repeatedly? Read it in the paper! I don't' want to see. You know I'm engaged. Has the engagement finished everything? Manav risked his life and you don't have a tear for him! This world has turned you to stone. Can't you make him one call? He has really loved you. Ila, Shannu, come on. Vikrant has called you. My love, may I appear in front of you? Just a minute. Please. You're not ready? The entire orchestra is waiting. Shaukat, hurry up! You were crying, isn't it? You were crying, isn't it? Missing him...? I know you love me. Brighten up with a Coke. Love grows with this. Drink this. Coke is our company sponsor. Drink it. Drink it. Look... We have to win this world competition. The person who sings with his heart and soul will win. You just concentrate on the song. Excuse me... Can I sing a song from our village in today's show? Village song? But we're all ready with the orchestra. Another song now? You just said the one who sings with his heart and soul will win. Mansi will sing a new song. With all her heart and soul. Promises I made in love... I have broken But my heart and life, I think, I have left there If not for love... If not for love... What would life be... if not for love, my Love? To what end would death be... if not for love? Love Love Sweeter than the sweetest is love; sourer than the sour, is love A promise kept and a tie with the lover is love So many Lovers before us... have already walked this path They are oceans... not a path in which they have all sunk The greatest truth; the biggest lie A promise kept; a bond between lovers Bereft of love, I am... What would life be without any love...? To what end would death be, if not for love? Lots of congratulatory calls have been coming from India. Are you happy? - I'm very happy. The tears you shed last night while singing was a terrific touch. This venom of Manav was to be ejected. I'm glad it happened before we got married. Had it happened after marriage, I would have been very hurt. Tomorrow fly back, the next day we get married and then... Do you know the BPL guys called up... And said we'll have a great reception at the airport! Tomorrow will be the best day of my life! Nobody will step forward! After today you will become Mrs. Vikrant Kapur. - Are you happy? - Yes. Is everything all right? Did Manav come here? - He did come. - What did he say? He wanted to meet Mansi. - Then...? - He just vanished. - ACP sir? - Yes? I need security. Strict security. Everything is arranged. Mansi is not feeling well. Can you please...? The entire drama is ready. You'll be married by 4 o'clock. Followed by a reception at Leela. Don't worry about Manav. We'll get him out of the way. Get him out. If need be. - We'll have a great time together. - Sister... - Father, sister needs you. - Hold this. - What is it? - What's going on? - What? - Whom are you laughing and drinking with? I get your point. In this world, we first make friends. Then we like them. Then we have fights. If the friend apologises after a fight... Love grows even more. Father, do you know what you're saying? Jagmohan has come to bless you. As my friend. Let's go in. Take this. Let her go. I'll make a move. - Brother, she... - Apology...? Doesn't matter. Welcome madam. You were drinking Coca Cola with Mr. Mehta? - Is that a crime? - You know what he is to us? He's an old friend of mine. Are you trying to teach me something? You are needlessly doubting! Mansi is waiting for you. Don't be scared. I've come to extinguish not light a fire in your life. No, Manav. Not today. It has to be today! It is essential to remove your sister's make-up today! Mansi, I only come to tell you... Marriage is neither a contract nor a festival! If it's a festival, it's for people! Marriage is a union of two souls and hearts! And two human beings live and die a good life together! By marrying Vikrant, you're deceiving him the most! Three lives are being ruined by it! You are marrying Vikrant but Manav lives in your heart! No. Nobody is in my heart. You are lying! Manav is present in every tone, every song of yours! Because Manav is your first and last love! - Come out, mister. - Just a minute. Look at you. You're crying! Your tears say that what is happening is not true! Lovers can die, not love! - Forget it, Manav. - I am yours and will wait for you! Control yourself. ACP sir. A man came into the lounge. Went in. Then he also went out. And you were watching? I was told he's a family member. - Is that wrong? - He's from my father's family! He's my enemy! Enemy! Enemy! - How long will it take? - About an hour and a half. - Yes? - I'm not feeling well. - May I sit in the car? - Yes. Take Mansi to the limousine. I don't understand. The marriage will be in the court and Mandap... Nor will you understand. This music has no tune. That's all. ACP sir? What security is this? Do you see that man with the dog? He is my enemy? He has a bomb in his pocket. ...which will blow up all of us! Just wait for a minute. - Don't move. - I'm not moving. - I thought you'd move. Why did you think of marrying in court before the ceremony? I'm from Aaj Tak from Delhi. Is it fine if I tell you this tomorrow? Come to Hotel Leela for the reception. Then ask me. Right now I'm a bit tense. - What happened? - Nothing. The boy is a fan of Mansi's. Like normal fans. We found this picture of Mansi in his pocket. No bomb like you said. There's a lot of difference between other fans and him. Arrest him. There has to be a reason. I can't simply arrest him! - You can't arrest him? - No, I can't. Then dance. Come on, dance. This public has driven me crazy! - How are you? - Fine. Manav is here. The leech! What does he want from us? - Do you know him? - He is Manav's dog. Very loving towards Manav's dog. He didn't come himself. Sent the dog instead. Get lost! Go back to that rascal! My dog will die! Hold him! Let go of me! Hit him! Sister! Let's go! Manav, your Brownie. Tell me something truthfully. - Yes? - What did Manav say to Mansi in the airport lounge? Swear by Mansi and answer. Manav said, Mansi you maybe marrying Vikrant... But only Manav lives in your heart. Look there... Have they come here too? - How much longer? - 3 are registered. Only 2 couples remain. Everything is fit. Will happen fast. We've organized everything. The international press will be at Leela. After all Superstar Kapu marries Beauty Queen Mansi. You must take the blessings of 7 disciples of Lord Shiva on Monday. You will always be victorious in life. Sorry, I don't have a coin. Take this. May the groom of your choice always keep you happy. The registrar will call you in 5 minutes. - I'll be there. - Prabha, bring both of them. In 5 minutes, we'll be married. Strange is life. Will you be honest with me? Are you happy? Yes, I'm happy. Do you love me? Do you love me? What a question that is! The coin that you just gave that mendicant... That reminded me of my mother. Mother... Wow! Mother would say, do good and forget about it. Do your duty, don't expect rewards. True love lies in sacrifice. And uncle called it trash. Grab! Grab! I don't' know why I feel I'm losing today. And that Manav of yours is trying to defeat me! And I'm not used to defeat! Not at all! I want to win. Come what may! If you feel indebted to me... You have to help me win. I...? How? Look at my love. I only possess arrogance. Envy. Anger! Obstinacy! And Manav? God lives in him. Many Gods. His love, true love has hurt me hard. Has always hurt me. He was right. Marriage is no contract or festival. It's a union of two souls. Two people live and die together bound in it. He was right. Winning the world, wearing western clothes don't change an Indian girl. Her first love remains her first love. Look, I'm a director. I know it. I hear the voice inside. Manav lives in every pore of you. In every drop of your blood. Look at this! Silly girl! You fought with your love and came to me. You changed yourself. But couldn't change your heart. Your heart is there... with Manav. Manav is the true music of your songs. Not me. Today... you have to give me victory. Do you know how? Open this door. And run to Manav in front of everyone. For my sake. For the happiness of all three of us. Go. Go, Mansi! We, I mean you, me and Manav will always remain friends. Come on. Don't think. Come on. He's called you. No, Mansi will go to Manav. Go Mansi. Go. Manav is waiting for you. Mansi has gone to Manav. Yes! So now we will hug! - We separated you. - And we're bringing you together. You have our blessings. Hug her. How will they? We're standing here! - Is this possible? - It is happening. - What is happening? - This can happen
