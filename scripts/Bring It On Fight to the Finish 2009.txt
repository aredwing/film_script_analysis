We've got your back, Lina. Yeah, girl, we tighter than a new weave. Go! Fight! Kill ! l mean, win ! Where you going, cheer-quitas? The Spirit Championship. That's where the baddest All Star squads go to compete. You don't look like no All Stars, ma. (LAUGHS) Well, we're not. Yet. But we will be. Then l guess you ain't got one of these. (GASPS) That's an All Star bracelet. But. . . Only the best of the best cheerleaders win those. How did you get one? How you think? You probably stole it. l know you did. Whatever. (UPBEAT HlP-HOP MUSlC PLAYlNG) (STUDENTS CHEERlNG) That's going on right here. Come on, bring it. ALL CHEERlNG) (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) ALL CHEERlNG) Catalina! No, mami! Lina, what are you doing? She married the gabacho! (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Stop! You're ruining everything ! ALL LAUGHlNG) (SQUEALlNG) Stop! What's going on here? (DlSTORTED) Cheer your little barrio hearts out! But Lina's coming to live with me and my daughter in Malibu ! ALL SHOUTlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY) No! (GROANS) lt was just a dream. lt was just a bad dream. (SlGHS) Now the real nightmare begins. Oh, whoa, whoa. Let me help you with that, Wife. Thank you, Husband. l know we sound silly, but l'll never get tired of hearing it. And l'll never get tired of saying it. (GROANS lN DlSGUST) l'm glad l skipped breakfast. (BOTH LAUGH) Lina, you don't have to go to school today, honey. Actually, yes, l do. lt's my last day in East LA, and as captain, l need to handle some squad business. l can give you a ride if you want. Mmm-mmm. No. l'd rather walk. Or get dragged by a bus. Lina, be nice. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Look, l'm gonna be late. l have to go. All right. Bye. Sorry. Oh. No, no, no. Honey, listen, you got to give her a little time. She'll adjust. Then we'll be one big happy family. l promise. Okay? l hate him. And his daughter, she creeps me out. She's like way too Single White Female. She's probably just mad excited about having a new sister. Treyvonetta, come on. Sky is not my sister. Not by cheer, blood or marriage. l feel you, Lina, but for real though, girl, you can't complain about moving to Malibu. You about to be living large. Yeah, right. Uh-oh. Love birds alert. Wassup? Trey and Lina are here, okay? l got to go. Come on, mija, you know l love you. As much as you love this car? Hey, at least she lets me get under the hood. You don't. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Watch it, girl. Oh ! l will watch it. You don't want none of these Golden Gloves. TREY: Get him, G. Easy, Oscar de la Ha-Ha. And you'd better not be late picking me up. What did l tell you about bossing me around in front of your girly girls like that? At 4:30, Victor. (SCOFFS) You can't tell me what to do. l'm a man. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) l'll be here at 4: 1 5 to pick up your little pom poms. Hey, make sure you two watch over my baby girl for me, all right? Victor, go. We got this. Go. ln the Gloria-mobile. This is so messed up, man ! l mean, now we're never gonna get to be All Stars without you, Lina. No, no, no. We're going to be All Stars. These quickie marriages, they never last. l'll be back. Okay, so if you're so sure you're gonna be back, then why don't you just come and stay with me? Because my mom thinks that going to school in Malibu is the best thing that ever happened to me. She's like, "You'll get a better education. lt's safe. l won't have to worry." Seriously, what is there to worry about? Besides, this is the first year our squad is actually tight enough to become real All Stars. ALL SQUEALlNG) That's what l'm talking about. Show everyone we're for real. See, that's what l'm talking about. l want you to be captain while l'm gone. Mmm-hmm. Me? Captain? Yeah. Why? Because, besides me, like, you have the most cheer experience. That is true, G. You probably came out the womb like this, "Give me a. . ." (lMlTATES BABY CRYlNG) (LAUGHlNG) That looks like me. But l don't do captain, all right? l hate being in charge, man. Whatever, you the one that got Victor wrapped around your baby finger. Yeah. l think you can handle it. That's because l've got something Victor wants. But he ain't gonna get it. He ain't gonna get it! Okay, you guys, the new beginning until the ripple goes like this. We're gonna change it now. lt starts with the same arm, same leg. lt goes one, two, three, four. Girls go back on five. (YAWNlNG) (LAUGHlNG) Hit six, six, seven then eight. Ripple style. Yeah, let's try that with the music. Ready? (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) Five, six, seven, eight. Go one, two, three, four. Go back, six. . . ALL LAUGH) This is a cheer-wreck. Yeah, our girl is dying over there. l feel like a witness to a cheer-icide. You think she'll get better? Hell no. (CHATTERlNG) Really! Listen, you all need to drop the attitude, because while l'm gone, Gloria is gonna be the captain. ALL PROTESTlNG) Okay, it's like that, huh? (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (GROANS lN DlSGUST) That's not very captain-like. Oh ! l'm sorry. My bad. Look, if we want to be All Stars, then we need to practice like All Stars. Okay? Now let's do this. Line up. Yeah, okay. Keep it loose. Oh ! This ought to be good. Charmaine, don't forget, pop on six, not seven. Five, six, seven, eight. Music. (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) Right. Okay. Remember, All Stars, that's what we want. Yes. Yes. All right. Pick it up. Okay, this is tight. This is tight, ladies. Now, out! ln you go, hard. That was hot. Go. Bring it in. Come on. East LA! East LA! East LA! East LA! ALL CHEERlNG) ln your face. But they couldn't do that five minutes ago. What's this? Just a little something so you won't forget us. Come on, guys, l can't forget you. You're my cheer sisters. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) l miss you guys already. (SlGHS) Come back soon, you know, Lina. Real soon. Catalina, mi amor, mi amor. lt's time to go. (SLOW SONG PLAYING) East Los. LlNA: Forever. TREY: Don't forget us, Lina. We love you. So, how many families live here? One. But it just doubled in size. Now, listen, l want you both to feel really comfortable here. Mi casa es su casa. Thanks, Enrique. Come on, that's not how Henry pronounces his name. lt's okay. She can call me whatever she wants. Really? Well how about. . . (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Only if you can say it in church. Well that's really gonna limit my vocabulary. (LAUGHlNG) Wow! This is my room? l don't think l belong here, you guys. Oh. . . Oh. No. Now that's bootleg. How are they gonna have a broken toilet right next to a new one? (LAUGHS) lt's not a toilet, Lina. lt's a bidet. A. . . What? A bidet. You use it to wash your. . . No, no, no. That's nasty. How. . . l don't even drink out of a public fountain. You expect me to use that? Oh ! l told Dad you were funny. Thanks, Sky, but your dad doesn't know me. He doesn't really even know my mother, either. Maybe, but l don't think it really matters. He said with lsabel, it was love at first sight. (SMlRKS) You mean first he saw her culata. And then he saw her tetas. What? Nothing. Anyway, we're sisters now. l have always wanted a sister. lt's gonna to take more than a marriage license to be considered sisters. Yeah, l know that. Even the Brady Bunch had issues. Right. Anyway, l'm supposed to tell you dinner's ready. You know what, l'm good. l'm actually kind of tired. lt's been a long day. Okay. Unfortunately. (SNlFFlNG) Remember, work on the sync in the table top combination and make sure that Trey sticks her full back. Yeah, okay. No problem. Hey, what's it like there? Lifestyles of the Rich and Annoying. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) You have to see this! This girl's room is like a cheer-seum. Her mother won championships three times! Wow! Oye, guey, that girl must have cheerleading in her blood. From what l've seen, l think it skipped a generation. Looking for me? Girl, l got to go. ls this you and your mom? Yeah. Wow. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) She must have been an amazing cheerleader. Don't! l really don't like people touching her stuff. Sorry. lt's fine. lt's no problem. Here. Okay. Come on. You don't want to be late for your first day of school. Right, because being the new kid is so much fun. SKY: Yeah. So the pool and the stadium are over there. And you can get vegan or sushi for lunch. And. . . Oh. That's the Tai Chi class, which doesn't count for PE credit. Go figure. Who are they? Malibu Jaguars. All Star squad. They belong to the cheerleading gym across the street, but unfortunately some of them go to school here. The Jaguars? They won the Spirit Championship last year. SKY: Avery's the captain. Now, she's a hater. A Sea Lion hater. Why? She used to be one of us but we didn't vote her captain, so she quit. She took all of our best cheerleaders with her. Hey, you just can't just walk up to them. Watch me. Avery? The Jaguars were sick last year at the Spirit Championship. l'm sorry, no autographs today. No, look, look, l'm not a groupie. l'm Catalina. My East LA squad is like this close to becoming All Stars, too. Wow! And l'm like this close to caring. l bet you'll care when we take that bracelet away from you this year. Cute. But then you'd have to beat us. And that's just not happening. Like her outfit. Was l talking to you? Excuse me. No, no, no. No time for cat fights, Kayla. As a matter of fact, Cat, why don't you go back to East LA? Just go south, and when you start to smell poverty, you're home. Excuse me, but, Lina, she lives here now. Wait. Your mother's that Mexican maid who married Sky's daddy. She doesn't look Mexican. For your information, we're Cuban-American. Fascinating. And my mother was a waitress. A maid with tips. You know, y'all are lucky that my girls are not here, because if they were here, we. . . You know what, save the urban drama, Cat. After all, you're the lucky one. l mean, you got to meet real All Stars today. They give Malibu-Americans a bad name. (STUDENTS CHATTERlNG) (EXCLAlMlNG) And guess what. Game over. We won by two. (LAUGHlNG) Oh ! That's gross. l'm sorry. And you are? Lina. Who are you? l'm surprised you have to ask. l'm Evan. Well, Evan, you have a booger. Uh. . . (BELL RlNGS) Hi. So, we just figured out your style. So are these old clothes? Are they supposed to be vintage? No, more like homeless couture. Look, l don't care what you label whores think. Where l'm from, this is tight. But you're here now, and you kind of stand out like bad teeth. Look, if you guys want to take this outside, we can do this. Hold up, jalapeo. Yeah, Cat. You know, it's one thing to be a fashion don't, but unless you want them to give you a permanent facial, don't threaten me. You must be Lina. Yeah, and who are you? l'm Sky's friend, Christina. Yeah, we're on the squad together. You're a cheerleader? (WEAKLY) Go Sea Lions. (LAUGHS) Look, no offense, but you sound like you've had a cheer-botomy. How come people always say "No offense" right before they offend you? (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (SlGHS) Look, it's been a. . . No offense, Lina, but you're just like them. (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) (CHATTERlNG) (DlALlNG) Hey, Lina. Tell me you guys nailed the Liberty combination ! We have to hit every stunt. Lina, Hold on. Victor, enough with the up and down. You really want to see my up and down? Okay, babe. Girl, we got a problem. No. Don't tell me that, Gloria. Step up! Make them practice harder. l did, but. . . Motivate them ! lnspire them ! There's nobody left to inspire, all right? Everybody quit. l mean, of course, except Trey. My team quit? Why? Because. Lina, l'm not you. All right? And they don't think that l can make them AII Stars, and honestIy, neither do l. l'm sorry. lt's okay. l know you. . . l know you tried. l really did. But, hey, it's not all bad, you know. You still get to be Princess Lina. Living in Malibu. ALL: Jaguars! ALL CHEERlNG) (SlGHS) lt ain't all good here, mi hermana. Look, l got to bounce. My bus is here. She just hung up. Sorry about your team. l'll deal with it later. Sure. But if you wanna keep up your skills until then, we have a spot on the Sea Lions. Are you serious? My squad ain't even cold yet and you're already cheer-jocking me? You're right. l'm so sorry. l. . . Why did you say that to Sky? Why? lt's not like she's my real sister. At least in East LA l had family. You have family here now, too, Lina. And Sky's been through so much already. How would you feel if you lost me? All right, l guess l'll try to be nicer. You're gonna do a lot more than try. You're gonna be joining the Sea Lions. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) Trying out, huh? No, just checking things out. That's cool. You know, they kind of suck after my sister quit. (SlGHS) No. You're Avery's brother? Not in her fan club, huh? l'm starting my own club. lt's called the League of Avery Can Kiss My Butt. Yeah? Well, you won't be the only member. (EVAN LAUGHS) You know, every pretty girl doesn't have to be a cheerleader. l mean, the stuff they do is way hard anyway. lt's not that hard. Oh. No? Okay, that's easy for a non-cheerleader to say. Okay. (BOTH LAUGH) So what's your thing? You play ball? Maybe. Think you can step? Here, take a shot. Really. No, no, no, really this time. Go ahead. Okay. Go ahead. Right there. (GASPS) l'm so sorry. Sorry, coach. You think l'm a klutz, don't you? Maybe a little. Come here. This is how you shoot. That's it. (LAUGHS) lt's perfect. Peep this. Okay. Lina! Hey, you came! (EXCLAlMlNG EXClTEDLY) Good news. You made the team. Let's face it, she is the team. And we voted you team captain. But you're captain. Yeah. By default, and l suck. But you are really good. Yeah. You could fix us. You know, l thought l can do this, but no. Come on. Come on. Use your powers for good. l mean, we do cheer at, like, all of Evan's games. Yeah. So? l don't care about him. (LAUGHS) Right. We'll pretend like we believe that. Please, Lina, we will work really hard. Because we could be really good. l promise. l'd settle for upright. Good luck with that. We still have to fill another spot. You could fill it with whoever you want to. lt could be somebody good. l just. . . Yeah? Like who? You swear to help me out? l will do whatever it takes. Okay, l'm in. ALL CHEERlNG) (DOORBELL RlNGS) Yes? Can l help you? (SCREAMlNG) Lina! (BOTH LAUGHlNG) Meet the newest member of our squad. Go, Sea Crabs! Sea Lions. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) You said to make more of an effort. Oye, guey, you got one smoking casa! Thank you. Okay. Henry's kindness is no excuse for you to take advantage of him, Lina! Not even a little? Gloria, tu mama, she must be worried about you. l almost forgot. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) She's got to go to work, but she'll call you in the morning to thank you. l have a boyfriend. Mama thinks this is like putting me in the Virginity Protection Program. You do realize that there's a waiting list at MV, right? Dad, can't you, like, dialog with the principal? Dialog? Please tell me you're not teaching her hood talk. Come on, Dad. Strings get pulled all the time. George Bush got into Yale, didn't he? Come on. No cheerleader left behind. Please, Daddy? Please. She used the "Daddy" card. She's good. All right. ALL SCREECHlNG) Thank you. Thank you. (THANKlNG lN SPANlSH) GlRL: Five, six, seven, eight. (UPBEAT SONG PLAYlNG) (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Are those the Mountain Lions? lt's the Sea Lions. And no, those are the Jaguars. No. That was a big bowl of wrong ! (YOWLlNG) Yeah. Looks like Dora the Explorer has a new pal. Seriously, Cat, you're like a stalker. Don't you have anything else, l don't know, better to do? Better than watching you sweat off a spray tan? Yes, l do. As a matter of fact, l'm going to Sea Lion practice. They voted me captain. And you're bragging about it. What a cheer-barrassment. Don't act like you didn't want to be the captain of the Sea Lions, Avery. That was way back when l was into charity. l'm so over that. Over. You're a big muscular girl. Are you gonna practice with the Sea Lions, too? Or just bench press them? ALL LAUGHlNG) (EMPHATlCALLY) Wait, wait, wait. She said you have grande muscles. Strong like bull. Oh. . . l'm bilingual. Right? l speak bitch, too. You got them right, man. Cheer-brujas. Mean and bony. Better than fat. Let's go. You know. . . ln a sec. But your girls, they're coming in too early. They need to hold on one, and then. . . (LAUGHlNG) Right. Now train your little Sea Lions to do that. Then maybe l'll be impressed. l'd rather be a Sea Lion, if this is the best you got. So, Cat, l'm guessing your little amiga hasn't seen the rest of the pod squad yet. Has she? They're really good. Really. Really good. Your Sea Otters got skills, right? (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) They have potential. Really? Where do they keep it? Why is that girl dancing with her tongue out? She said it helps her concentrate. l used to have a dog who did that. He couldn't cheer either. Okay. All right, l know it's bad, but, Christina, she's got tumbling skills and Sky has spirit. And don't forget her mom won, like, every award. Like, deep down, she's got cheerleading in her gut! Too bad it's not in her brain or muscles. We've got some work to do. Yeah. Six, seven, eight. One, two, three. . . Load it out. Load it out. . . .four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. High knees. High knees. Six. You ain't cute. One, two, three, four, five, six. Hey! Hey.

She was one of our best dancers. l mean, l know that's not saying much, but what are we supposed to do now? l've got an idea. (DOORBELL RlNGlNG) (SQUEALlNG) ln the house! ALL LAUGHlNG) (GASPS) This is nice! You all should go on Cribs. Hey, l'm Treyvonetta. Girl, how many bedrooms you all got? Six bedrooms and seven and a half baths. We can each have own our own suite.

Five, six, seven, eight. One and two, three and four. Five, six and roll it out. One, two, three and give it. l feel so white. Me, too. Like Clay Aiken white. Okay, okay. Come on, get up. You know, rhythm has no color. You know, just shake and jive. Gonna have some fun. That's right! Come on. Shake what your mama gave you. l mean, we just could keep the old routine until, like, after the game. Or until we graduate. Look, you want this school to respect you, right? Yeah. ALL: Yeah. Then you've need to respect yourselves. Which means you need to improve on your skills. That's right. So let's drop it like it's hot. ALL GASP) Hit it, girl. Take notes. Yeah. ls there an easier version that's maybe, like, lukewarm? Sky, this is the easy version. Now, come on, Sea Lions. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) You can do this. That's right, come on. All right.

(LAUGHlNG) Dude, l'm trying. But l swear, every time l step to her, l say something stupid. So, l don't know how well it's going. Bro, you just got to know how to handle these chicas.

Okay. l see the little wheels turning in your evil little head. What you thinking? That we're outnumbered and unarmed. lf we were surrounded by all these people back home, what would we do? Pretend to no habla ingles? Use our white voices? No. Call for backup. Honestly, l was gonna say run. But let's do that. Guys, l know exactly what we need to do. (SPANlSH SONG PLAYlNG) Lina, l don't think this was a good idea. How do they move their bodies like that? Don't be scared, Sky. Look, l got you looking good. This is impromptu flavor school for you guys. We're about to loosen you guys up. What do you mean? (EXCLAlMlNG) You'll see. What's wrong now? Nothing. l just realized something. l just realized Lina already has two sisters. She doesn't need me. Come on, you're being so Betty Buzzkill right now. l know you better than anyone else and it seems to me like you both need each other. l have homework. l should go home. Sky? Man, you look hot.

All right. Lina. You know, it's called stalking, Evan. Yeah? Let me guess. Your new friend Victor told you l'd be here. Yeah, maybe. You know, but l cannot believe you didn't invite me to your little party yourself. l mean, especially after l told everyone how much l like you. lt's just rude. You did not. (BOTH GlGGLE) No, but l will. Are you always this corny? You just make me nervous. Me? Yeah. Why? You're Mr. Popularity. Come on. That's what those other kids see me as. But you don't. And l dig that. Christina, why can't we be more like them? Because we took a purity pledge. But that doesn't mean we can't be more cool and hot like they are. l guess. Uh-oh. Yo, what you looking at? Who, me? Nothing. Are you calling my girl nothing? l saw the way you was looking at her. What way? There was a way? No, there's no way. l was just looking. So you admit you was looking at me. All right, l'm gonna show you something to look at. Wait. You want to fight me because l looked at you? What, did you think you could just look at my girl and get away with it? Uh-uh. We don't play that here. Christina, do something. Lina! Lina! Help! They're gonna kill Sky! Wait, hold up. Wait, what's the problem? l don't know. l mean, l was just looking at her. And then she came down the stairs and. . . (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) No! Why, Sky? Sky, you just can't be looking at people. l mean, the last girl that looked at me needed stitches. Yo, what's up with your girl, Lina? Staring like she loco. You know the deal. Yeah, l do, but she don't. She's from Malibu. Like, people over there just be looking at each other for no reason. All the time. Let me talk to her and explain it. She'll be straight. Okay? Fine. We didn't come here to fight, no way. Will somebody tell me what just happened. Sky, you can't just be looking at people any kind of way. Like, you can glance at somebody and smile. But if you stare at them or you give them one of these. Or one of these. That's disrespectful. And your ass. You understand, chica? Yeah. l think so. Good, next time we bring you to East LA, bring your sunglasses. Yeah. Big ones. All right, come, honey. lt's all good. Everything okay? Yeah, come on. SKY: Five, six, seven, eight. Two. Five, six, seven, eight. Two. What's wrong with me? Two, four. God. . . l suck. Great. Okay. One. . . Hold your chest up. What's the use? l'm nothing like my mother. Sky, look, l'm sure that's not true. Because as much as l hate to admit it, l'm a lot like my mom. l'm opinionated, stubborn. . . Loud. Yeah, that, too. Which means you have to have a part of your mom in you. You really think so? Yeah, l really do. Well, would you help me find her? Yeah. Ready? Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Keep your chest up. Seven, eight. One, two, three and sit in it. Five, six, seven, clap. That's what l'm talking about. lt's fun. (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) ALL: Here we go! Malibu Vista on the move. Taking all you fools to school. We're caliente. You know, hot, hot, hot. We always stay on top. We make you sweat 'cause we run faster. Try to catch up and we say hasta. ALL CHEERlNG) Sea Lions! Sea Lions! Sea Lions! Sea Lions! Sea Lions! Sea Lions! Oh, my God. That was fun. (EXCLAlMlNG) Someone just had a cheer-gasm. What? No! You guys are crazy. Don't front, Lina. She don't need to. She's already got Evan's nose wide open. Whatever. You know. For real, though. That boy's nose is so open you could drive a truck up those nostrils. What's this? lt's a shoe-vite. l'm having a RDD party and l want you guys to come. Look, Avery isn't in charge of the social order at Malibu Vista. l am. And despite the little debacle at the game the other day, everyone can see that Lina is making the Sea Lions fabulente! Everybody is talking about it. So. . . See you there? And, please, dress to excess! Okay, so l'm gonna need two of these, then. Thank you. l need a right and a left. Perfect. Thanks. (THANKlNG lN SPANlSH) New shoes. Oh, my gosh. Sweet! Okay, we've just been jumped into the Rodeo Drive Divas. Uh-uh. Hold up. Mama said l can't be in no gang. No, it's not a gang. l mean, well, not really anyway. But they are the most exclusive clique at MV. l mean, their parties are legendary. Look, you've got it twisted. We're cheerleaders. They'll be lucky if we come to their party. Thank you. She's right. l mean, cheerleaders are supposed to be at the top of the social food chain. l wish we could go. l mean, l would give my best toe-touch if l could party with the RDDs. Well, l didn't say we're not going. l mean, we're cheerleaders, and we are the party. ls that right, Sea Lions? (CHEERlNG) ALL: Sea Lions! Sea Lions! Sea Lions! Sea Lions! VlCTOR: You look so pretty, mami. GLORlA: l do? Yeah, you do. Baby. Hey, l cannot believe that you let Evan drive. That was so sweet, papi. Only 'cause he loves cars as much as me. But you love me more. Of course, mija. Victor, let's go walk on the beach. Why? 'Cause it's romantic. Getting sand in your shoes, that ain't romantic. That's why you'll never get none. Let's go, then. (BOTH LAUGHlNG) Okay. So, l got invited to that Divas party, too. You want to go together? Evan, if we go together, people are gonna talk. l already know what people are saying. l don't care, really. Wait, wait. What have you heard? No, let me guess. Your sister who told you l'm some puta chasing after a rich white boy. Don't get caught up in Avery's drama, please. No. You don't get it. No, you don't get my sister. She has to dominate everything. For instance, when she didn't get Sea Lion captain, she cried for three days. For real? Yeah. So, l guess when Avery's mean to you, it means she sees you as a threat. Well, thanks for telling me that. Then go to the party with me. Only if you practice your salsa. What? l thought l had a pretty decent salsa. No. So, l'm not the best dancer. But l hope you think l'm better at this. (SEAGULLS CAWlNG) (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) Okay, so. . . Okay. That totally spoiled the mood, huh? Yeah. Last one to the ocean. l'll beat you. No, you won't. (ROCK BALLAD PLAYlNG) What is she doing? Nice salsa hips, sea monkey. Yeah, you should go on Dancing With the Tards. Don't run away. Mess with my squad and you mess with me, Avery. Leave Sky alone. Gladly, if you'll leave my brother alone. Your brother and l like each other. Sky wants nothing to do with you. The feeling is mutual. Avery, the United Nations is boring me. Anyway, we have All Star practice. Unlike you. Bye. Kick rocks. You know, they're not gonna stop until somebody puts a foot up their spanks. Bump it. l'll do the time. Wait, wait, wait. l got an idea. Put cream depilatories in their hair conditioner? No, let's take them on for real. At the All Star Championship. (SCREAMlNG) l like that. That works. Come on, girl, smile. Don't be nervous. You know what we could do? We could do a. . . Yeah, but. . . Look, the only way we're going to shut Avery up is if we beat her on her own turf. And the only way to do that is to become All Stars. You mean, we won't be Sea Lions anymore? No, we'll still cheer for the school, but we're gonna have to double up our practices to be ready for the Spirit Championship. ALL GROANlNG) Hey! Hey, wouldn't it be worth it if it'll crush the Jags? She's right. l mean, l secretly plot their demise like a comic book villain, and that's not healthy. Lina's way is better. But don't we need a gym to sponsor us? Let me worry about that. All l want to know is if you guys are down, because we need to take this to the next level. Yeah ! And then cut the brakes on those Jags, and watch them crash and burn. . . Okay, minus the crazy part, that's exactly the spirit we need. So do you guys feel it? Who wants to win? Yeah ! ALL: Sea Lions! What about it, Sky? What do you think? l think it's time to bring it. KAYLA ON PHONE: Like, pick up. Like, pick up. Like... Avery speaking. Aren't you lucky? Guess what Tila Tequila and her Sea Lions are up to now. Kayla, Tila Tequila isn't Latin. But tequila's Mexican, right? Yeah, but she's like, Asiany. Whatever. Anyway, word on the blog is they're becoming an All Star team. Get out. (LAUGHlNG) And there's more. They're going to compete in the Spirit Championship. Hello? Yeah. Wait, you're not sweating those wannabes, are you? Of course not. They're just a joke. Look, l'll see you tomorrow. One last thing. My sources tell me that Evan is taking little Lina Lambada to the RDD party. (GRUNTS lN FRUSTRATlON) You asked Cat to the RDD party? Let it go, Avery. Evan, she's a freaking Sea Lion. So now the truth comes out. lt was never about her mother, was it? Look, Evan, you're a nice guy, which is why you're blind and stupid. Now that the little Sea Lions think that they're All Stars, Cat's just using you to psych me out. But, l've seen them practice. You might want to go back on your meds, because your Jags, they have some serious competition. Not in my worst cheer-mare. (UPBEAT SONG PLAYlNG) Well, well, looks like you ladies better get ready for the championship, huh? The thought of the Sea Lions in the Spirit Championships makes me ill. Kayla, honey, that's sushi, not an Oreo. Ahi helps me think. About what? l have a friend who's been on the MV waiting list for months. So? So l wonder, how did those Sea Lion ringers get approved so quickly? Well, l thought it was obvious. Pure talent. Evan, go away. Okay, bye. Someone snuck them in. OMFG ! Kayla, they're illegal cheer-migrants. Evan is really good. Yeah, he knows. So, l'll pick you up tomorrow, okay? Okay. ls it cool if Sky rolls with us? She doesn't have a date. Yeah. Of course it's cool. l feel like Cinderella. Yeah, me, too. l mean, the guy, the guy. . . You know, Charming? Yeah, that guy, yeah. So, tomorrow. Okay, see you. Perfect. All right, guys, you ready? Let's do this. (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) Five, six, seven, eight. Bring it up. And roll it around. What? Sky, what's wrong? Why is you dad talking to the principal? All right, but l want to be the one. . . l don't know. What's wrong? Gloria, Treyvonetta, you need to come with me, please. Henry, what's wrong? Look, there's no easy way to say this, Lina. The Board has revoked their transfer approval effective immediately. That's not fair. lf anyone should be punished, it's us. Look, girls, if there was anything l could do, you know l would've. Now, you know l would've. l'm sorry, but. . . Let's just go, girls. Peace. Out, you all. GlRL: Take care. Lina! You jealous bitch. You ratted us out. lt's a good thing you can't touch me, because you could be expelled just like your little home girls. Don't blame Avery for getting them deported. One more word from you, and l will herkie you in the throat. You forgot you can't reach me. lt's okay, Kayla. l'll gladly take the credit for clubbing those baby seals. Hey, Cheer-ella De Vil, there's a big difference between seals and sea lions, you know. Hey, goofazon. l don't care. Post it for your BFF on your fungus-filled Facebook page. You are seriously trying to catch an All Star beat down. lt's okay, Lina. Calm down. lt's not worth it. Let's go say goodbye to our friends. And say bye-bye to the Spirit Championships while you're at it. Bye-bye. BOY: Bye, losers. Hey! What are you doing out here? You have to get ready for the party. l'm not going. lt doesn't feel right without my girls. They should be here. lt's not fair. No, it's not, but look at it this way. Do you think they would want you sitting here feeling sad and miss out on your first real date with Evan? l don't know. (LAUGHlNG) Come on, you know what they would say. And l can hear Gloria and Trey now, "Mami, you better handle that double dip of vanilla caliente!" "Shoot, 'cause if you don't, l'm a push up on you, girl. "Real talk." (LAUGHlNG) Okay. Okay, that was so scary. All right, l'll go, as long as you promise to never do that again. Okay. And to never wear that again. What. . . You need a fashion intervention. Let's get to work on this. What is this? Mami! Come on. (ROCK BALLAD PLAYlNG) Up. (BOTH LAUGHlNG) Wow. lt doesn't even look like me. lt looks like. . . Your mom. l noticed that, too. Okay. Got it? lt's so curly. You look cute. Don't worry. Wait. l almost forgot. Here. l want you to have this. My mom's team gave it to her. She was a really good captain, too. Sky, l can't take this. No, no, no, no. She'd want you to have it. She would've really liked you. lt'll look really nice with my outfit tonight. Oh, my God. What? l got to get ready. Okay, go, go, go. Whoa! Yeah. You look amazing. Thanks. To be honest, l think that every time l see you. Too corny? Yeah. But l like it. (CLEARlNG THROAT) Sorry, but if l don't start dancing soon, then these heels are so not worth it. Okay, let's go. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Hang on, hang on, hang on. We've gotta take a picture. Catalina. All right. Get in there, now, okay. Close, now. Now, say, "l'm with stupid !" l'm with stupid ! ALL LAUGH) Perfect. Okay. Bye, honey. Have fun. You look great. Drive carefully. Bye, Mommy. Adios. Bye. Hi. Christina, you look hot. Just hot? Because l was going for sizzling. (HlSSlNG) Mmm-hmm. Definitely sizzling. Thanks, but. . . That was definitely not sanitary. (SQUEALlNG) Trey? How are you? Hey, baby. Sky, you did this? Yes, l wanted to surprise you. EVAN: How are you? Good to see you. What's up, Evan? Wait. This is my song. Shall we? (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) Look at her. She acts like she owns this world. She'll never be like us. Oh, oh ! Like mother, like daughter. Shut up, Avery. You shut up. lgnore her. Hey, you okay? l can handle her. (DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) ALL: Oh ! l'm sorry. ls there a waiting list for this spot, too? Look around, Cat. You don't belong here. First your mother. And now your little ghetto friends. l'm sorry, but l don't think you're going to be happy until there's drive-bys and chickens in the front yard ! Go back to the barrio, where you belong ! Go. Go, bye. BOY: Peace out! What, Evan? No, let Evan talk to her. l don't know what to do. lt's okay. Ear-muffs! Ear-muffs! Come on. Let me give her just one good left hook. Lina, wait! Come on. Leave me a glass slipper or something. lt's not funny, Evan. Okay, okay. l'm sorry. Listen, what Avery did back there was pure evil. l know. You know, she's the reason my friends got kicked out of school. Oh, my God. What? You saw what she did back there. l'm not defending her, okay? But they did break a rule. And? Rules get broken all the time. But, come on, that doesn't make it right. Of course you'd be on Avery's side. Come on. What? Did you narc them out, too? How can you say that? You know, l guess l'm just another chica gone loca, right? You know how wild and hot-blooded we are! Now you do sound crazy. Then leave me alone, Evan. We're done. Really? l mean it. Lina. . . Wait, wait, wait. G, yo, come pick me up. What? Take me back to East LA. l'm staying with you. No, Lina. You can't leave. LINA: Why? What... The Spirit Championship? The Sea Lions will be fine without me, okay? All you have to do is find another chica from East LA. You know it's not like that. Look, we're sisters. l'm your hermana, too. Avery's right. l don't belong here. l'm sorry, Sky, l can't be your captain anymore. lt's yours. Lina, yo, we want you back, but you cannot desert the Sea Lions. We all worked too hard to make them good. They'll be fine. You know that ain't true. Lina, if you bail on them, they are going to fall apart. Just like the East LA squad. Lina, that sucked. l can't go back. l'll look stupid. Yeah, but you gotta. You're the captain. l hate you guys! And we miss you, too, boo. Now, go ahead. Do us right. Come on. l'm not replacing the girls. We don't have enough time. We'll just rework the routines. Okay? (ROCK BALLAD PLAYlNG) l have bad news. We are turning in our pom poms. Sorry. We're done. Later. Peace. Guys. . . They hate me. What? Why? They said it's hard enough to keep their grades up, my routines are too hard, and that the extra practice is sending their GPAs into a downward spiral. So, we only have half an All Star squad now. So, what are we going to do? l don't know. l'm still trying to find a gym around here, but they all sponsor other squads. Are you gonna give up? And let Avery win? Never. Hey, Cat, you're dreaming if you still think you have a shot at winning the Spirit Championships. Yeah, it's a competition. Not a siesta. Back off, skanks, before l slap that cheer out of your mouth. l mean, you think you can just roll up on us without even thinking about it? Yo, yo, we don't play that game. And l am so sick of you fronting like you were stunting. You know what? As a matter of fact. . . No, no, no, no, Sky. . . This is not gonna be good. This is not gonna be good. But it's gonna be on. Check it, l got this. So, watch what you're looking at. Sky. l got this. Watch what you're looking at. For real. Just chill. Chill. Someone's getting a little ghetto. Go practice that Zen thing. Who took the spirit stick out of your butt? Look, Avery, Evan was right. The only reason you sweat me is because you know that l can beat you. No, that just means Evan was wrong about two things. Choosing you and doubting me. l don't think so. No, that's right. You wouldn't. Because, see, you don't think like an All Star. Come on. Don't touch me. What did that cheer-ial killer mean by that? Don't know. Don't have time to think about it. Look, l am canceling practice. We're going to meet after school, though. Why? We're going on a field trip. l knew we should've took the bus. Where are we? Some of my squad still volunteer here every week. And l called Gloria and she said a bunch of them will be here today. (GlGGLlNG) (SPANlSH SONG PLAYlNG) ALL: LA! East LA! East LA! Lina! What's up, girl? l miss you, too. Lina, why are we here? Because l've got the best idea l've ever had. Gloria got this gym to sponsor us as All Stars! l know! All we got to do is combine Sea Lions with East LA, and we could become a dream team ! Look, Avery was right. All Star squads are nothing like high school squads. lt doesn't matter where you live. We can cheer together and become a whole new All Star team. l've been trying to tell you. Okay, l know l wasn't thinking. Sea Lions, come on, get into formation ! (SlGHS) See? My routine has a serious Latin and hip hop feel, and no matter how hard l try, they still don't get it. "My routine?" Lina, you're the one who needs to get it. What? You are trying to make them us. No, l'm trying to make them good. Look, Lina, you know that every cheerleader has their strengths. Use them. Stop trying to make the Sea Lions something they're not. Use Christina's gymnastic skills. And nobody has better facials than Sky. And she's stupid flexible. Maybe we can up the difficulty on all the stunts. Yo, it'd be tight if we added another pyramid sequence. And a load into a 2-1 -1 ? And look, since the party, they got some rhythm in their hips. Maybe l can get Victor to teach them some of their boxing moves. Girl, yo, that would be dope. We're about to have an All Star routine that's off the chain. No one's going to think to break it down like this. Nobody. Okay. All right. Okay, Sea Lions, are you guys ready to be All Stars? You guys down with it? ALL CHEERlNG) Okay, Y to the yes! You know, we can come here to practice. ALL: Dream Team, let's get to work! (SPANlSH SONG PLAYlNG) Excuse me. l like you, Lina. l like that you're stubborn and competitive. Because you're talented. And that you're an insanely beautiful klutz. You know, and l like how you brush me off but at the same time you make me feel like you're into it and that maybe l have a chance. You know, and the fact that you think you're so different and out of place here. But in all reality, you're just being yourself. And the way you look at me, l mean, l feel like you actually see me. And most of all, l like that l can be myself around you. ALL: Ooh ! Everybody got that? Yeah, l got that. We heard every word. BOTH: We're putting it on YouTube! Good. Now it's on you. Evan, what was that? l thought we talked about this. Yeah, l love you, too, sis. Are you trying to ruin my life? (UPBEAT DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG) ALL CHANTlNG) (YELLlNG EXClTEDLY) Don't worry, it's only cheerleading ! Look who's barrio fabulous again. What are they doing here? You were right, Avery. l wasn't thinking like an All Star. But you know what? What? Now l'm thinking like a winner. Honestly, l'm glad they're here, because when you're an All Star you want to compete against the best. And you guys are. . . (LAUGHlNG) l'm so sorry. l really thought that l could say that with a straight face. But the truth is you're still losers. (SPEAKlNG SPANlSH) l don't speak Taco Bell menu. So, what does that mean? Bring it! ALL HlSSlNG) Hey, guys. l'm Giuliana Rancic here for E! Entertainment News, at the All Star Spirit Championship.

You see all those people out there? They believe in us. This is the Spirit Championship, and l ain't leaving without a bracelet. Y'all down? ALL: Yeah !
