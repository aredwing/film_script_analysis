All seems fine, the ship sets sail but at the deepest point in mid-ocean a blackness settles upon our souls. There's an old saying amongst sailors: "We have a corpse in the cargo." Good drum. It's perfect. - No, thanks. - It can say everything you want. - This bag... - I said no. - It's real skin. It's nice! You can buy for your girlfriend. - Yeah, my girlfriend. - You can. She'd kill me if I buy this crap. - I give good price, no? How much? I'll give you five. OK, ten, more than it's worth. Alright, my last offer, 15. Because it's your lucky day. - Is not for you. And it's not for sale. Fuck you. Give me that bangle! - Fuck it! - Give me the bangle! Alright, I'll give you the bangle. I'll give you the bangle! Stop it, you arsehole! Piss off. Very funny! Very funny. Passport. OK? What? Visa. I'm from Germany. It's a European passport so I don't need a visa. Come with us. I want a bottle of whisky and none of this Japanese shite. A bottle of fucking whisky, OK? Fuck's sake, will you listen? Patience, sunshine. Don't fucking touch me. A bit of fucking patience, alright? Watch what you're doing, sunshine, or I'll take your head off! Thank you very much, mate. Thank you. Are you fucking blind there, cunt? - Blind as a bat, sunshine. Who the hell are you? I'm Chris. Spike. - Sasha. Are you guys together? - We are down the docks. On a ship. Them too? You? - Trying to get home. You might wanna see this. What is this? An export license. You'll have no problems. Don't worry. - I like to worry. I swear, you'll have no problems. How many can you get? - As many as you can pay for. You'll scare it, you mad bastard. - How much is it worth? - 700 Dollars. Fuck! Better than the last time. - Aye. If they survive. Make them survive. We lose the birds, we lose the ship. Where are you heading? - Marseille, France. Marseille. You understand? Marseille. I wish you the best. - No. Come on, man. Have a drink. I said no. Marseille. You put the money up your arse, you little wanker! Come here! I'm with them. Heading for Marseille. Fucking move it. Move it! Move that box up there! Keep coming! Keep coming! Keep coming! Down, down. Right, lift it! Got enough of this stuff to last for ten days? - They'll be fine. - What? They'll be fine. - What do you know about it? You don't! Fuck sake! They know. They can tell. They know. - Herman. Just let it go, OK? Just let it go. Let it go. OK? Shut up! You're an animal. Yes, I'm an animal. You're a machine. Yes, I'm a machine. Big fucking... I saw you. I fucking saw you! Come down here! Now! Now! Fuck you. Come here! What the fuck are you laughing at? Come here. Closer. Closer. One word... and I'll cut your fucking throat. So? It's a long story. - Cut it short. Picked up a truck in Spain. Spare parts. - All stolen. I'm not a thief. I just helped my mate to drive it down. He went back to pick up another truck. I stayed, to see the place, bummed around and got mugged. Some stupid bastard stole my money and my passport. - What kind of passport? What's the difference? I'll work my way. My little chirpy friend, you are a stowaway. Fines, police, courts, immigration! You're about as welcome as a hedgehog stuffed up my ass. - What passport? German. A European passport. How much money was in his wallet? About 50 dollars. I'll pay him back. I'm sorry. But when I heard Marseille, I could not believe my luck. I took a chance. I wanna get home. So you risk our home? What do you mean? You can work with the Baptist. I don't need him. In the kitchen. I prefer not. In the kitchen. Take him to his bunk. Room number nine. Room number nine. If you don't mind, captain... - I do mind. You're in there. What's wrong? You shouldn't be here. Who the fuck are you? My name's Chris. Can I help you? - No, I just heard the voices. Nobody was here so... Any normal people on this boat? Just one. Who's that? - You. Why are you called the Baptist? I used to baptize people. - Not anymore? I believe in nothing anymore. I cook, that's it. You're no ordinary cook. What are you doing here? You be careful. Seven days to go. Head down. Mouth shut. Get off this boat. Hey, Fifi. Toilet time. What the fuck are you laughing at? Toilets. Dirty bastard! Shit! "Rebecca, for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest." There's no way home! And we can't fly. We can't go home. The birds all know! The birds all know that we can't go. We've got no wings! What the fuck is wrong with him? - I don't know, I don't know. Overimportant and nowhere else to go but turn back. Turn, turn, turn right on West-Asia! Turn right on West-Asia! Can't fly! Can't fly! Come on, you fool! Jump! Jump! Jump! Can't go home. Can't go home. They've come back. They've come back! They've come back! You have to come down. OK? You have to come down. Excuse me, Tweetie. Can you pass the salt? There you are. Thank you. Stop it! Fucking leave him alone. Found it by the birds. It wasn't there this morning. This yours? No. Are you sure? Yes. Go and look. Luis. The two Franks. And you. No. No! Now. - Not me! No! - Go! I don't wanna go there! Come on. - What are you doing? Where are we going? What are you doing? Lock the door, shut your eyes and go to sleep. Now! He knows nothing! - Who knows he's here? Who the fuck knows he's here? I don't trust him. Just get rid of him! What did I tell you last night? Where did you sleep? Captain wants to see you. Come in, Chris. You have family, Chris? Yeah. You must miss them. We're close. Did you sleep well last night, Chris? You seem tired. - Fine, thanks. Sweet dreams? I never dream. Clear conscience. And you? Didn't sleep a wink. Why did you stick up for Herman? I don't know. There's always one. - Just happened. - One against the gang... Takes courage. I admire that. What was the moment... What was the moment when you thought "enough"? What fucking difference does it make? Fuck! You know, don't you? They know too. What? Don't pretend. I know that you know. You know! - What are you talking about? About the boy. The boy! What boy? - The boy! And Rebecca. Don't pretend you don't, you know! I don't understand, I'm sorry. They've come back. Who? They've come back. It's nothing, Herman. Just cool it. The killings. You know. Herman. Herman? Fucking liar. Search the place again. Find him. Down there all by yourself with Herman... did he mutter anything that might help us? He does mutter, doesn't he? You're a curious lad. What did you ask him? Why he climbed the mast. What did he say? He told me about the birds. How they can fly back home thousands of miles to the same old nest. He swore they sense something that we miss. What do you make of that? What's in the hold, Chris? I said, what's in the hold? What do you mean? What's in the hold, Chris? Cocoa. The hold is full of cocoa. Chocolate. Have you ever asked yourself why you've never sunk your teeth into a bar of African chocolate? Go feed the birds. Right on the edge. Can you believe that? Three cards. Somebody's down there. Who is Rebecca? You shut the door, turn the lock, go to sleep. Don't ask me anything. What's wrong, Captain? What the fuck is that? Herman, is it you? Shut up! What the fuck is this? You, go there. Who are you? What do you want from me? Subira! Subira? You're called Subira? Yeah? - Chris! Where the fuck are you? We landed in Europe with the stowaways. They were arrested in the dock. Ship tied up. Couldn't pay the fine. The big fucking fine. We lost her. Our ship. Rebecca. Our home. We swore, if it happened again, we would take measures. Family measures. To defend our ship. Stowaways. Herman found them. One by one we threw them over. We all agreed, all took a turn. All but one. He refused. What happened? He called the Coast Guards. The last thing he ever did. God. Tell me the truth, Chris. What happened down there? I swear I didn't see a thing. The men say you lie. I believe you. They're scared. Scared of you. When we're scared, we change. I thought, maybe... maybe we could help one another. Where is Luis? Fuck! Frank. What do you want from me? - Come on! No! No! Where the fuck is Luis? And Herman? - I swear I don't know! We don't believe you! - I didn't see anything! But I heard something! Don't know what happened to Herman and Luis but I heard footsteps! I swear! I brought down some food! Where'd you leave it? Where did you leave the food? Behind the water barrel. - He's a fucking liar. Wait, wait! We'll soon find out. Chris. What is it? I want you to see something. What are they doing? Thanks to you, we found them by the barrel. This is how it is. This is how it works. You can't do that. Stop them. Stop it! Stop it! You're either with us... or against us. I feel ill. Feel ill. I feel I've got that chicken flu coming. I just wanna ram-bam-boo, sing my song, baby. Chrissy, you're one of us now, baby. You are one of us. How does it feel to be one of us tonight? Take a little drink, Chris. Sorry, Fifi! Chris, Chris! Chris, drink! Chris, drink! And one for the road! More, more! Our little Fifi! Where is he? Get up. Get up! Come on. That's better. Don't let them break you. Get your fucking hands off me! I tried to protect you from all this. I tried. I really, really tried. All I did is leave some food. - It's OK, it's OK, take it easy. I don't understand what's going on. - You will. I don't know what happened to the others. I swear. - Christopher. Why are you willing to risk your life for people you don't even know? You don't know yourself, do you? What are you going to do with me? Depends on you. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't know! Let me go. I don't know where he is. But I don't know where he is. I don't know! I don't know! I don't understand! Fuck off! Jesus Christ! Everybody up! Up, up, up! Herman, Luis and the two Franks. Shut the fuck up! Get the weapons. This time every square fucking inch. Go! Nothing. Fuck all. Nothing. - Nothing? OK. Search the place again. - There's no one here. Fuck it! What are you doing? Come back here. Come back here! What the fuck are you doing? OK. Fuck off, all. Better take it down. You've known all along? She's a girl. Her name's Subira. Don't even speak the language. Anybody else? - No. See if you can find her. I'll meet you by the barrel. Subira! Subira! I wanna help you! It's OK. Someone's gonna help us, OK? It's all right. No, no! It's a friend. It's fine. Fuck. Baptist. Run, Chris, run! Run, run! Are you all right? I know his name! Abrahim! Now how did I find out? Ask Chris. No, don't listen. Don't listen to him. - Abrahim. He's lying. Don't listen to him. I swear. Subira. We'll find them, Captain. - No. No, she'll find me. How's Ramazan shaping up in the kitchen? Is he... capable? This is all wrong. - Neither right nor wrong. Jesus! What did Chris do to you? He might save us all. I taught you first. You were my favorite. You were the closest to me. - I've been quiet too long. It's not too late, even for you. It's never too late. - Yeah, yeah. - You can be a good man. It's time. Cut the engines. Subira. Such a beautiful name. Look at my new whore! Nice, very nice! Captain wants to see you! Fuck. Come out, Chris, or she's gonna die! What happened to the Baptist? In vain, as always. Let her go. It's not her fault, let her go. I beg you. She doesn't beg. What the fuck is wrong with you? What's wrong? Stop this madness. It's too late. What happened in room number nine? Gulls, Chris. Gulls. Self-centered, single-minded survivors. Will you gull with us? What the fuck are you talking about? All but one. One against the gang. Fighting, kicking, screaming... He wouldn't shut up. And then he made that call. What happened in room number nine? Gulls. They devour their own. He was your son. I broke his neck in room number nine. And I threw him in the sea. No fucking getting back from there, is there? Yes. By letting her go. And me, too. I can't. It's gull time. Take them up. - No. I know you can. You can do it. You can save us. And save yourself. Do it for me. Think of your son! Gull with us, Chris. You're either with us, or you're against us. Subira. Leave him! Leave him, Ramazan, leave him. It's OK, it's OK. Rot in hell, Brookes. Where are you? Where are you? Oh, Chris. Get him out. Ralph. I want everyone off this ship. What about the girl, Captain? Leave her be. Just leave her be. The keys to the safe. Take the money and go. Go. All of you. Save your miserable souls. Everybody.
