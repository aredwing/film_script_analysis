His Countenance revealed itself with such clarity that I recognized in it all the countenances and all the forms that ever existed wherefrom he received honor and service in all right I saw why each one must receive his part in damnation and in blessing I saw how each one must be set in his place why some wander away from him and return to him again and why others wander and never return and how some remained standing entirely still and almost devoid of consolation at all times. And others have remained in their place since childhood have known themselves at their worth, and have held out to the end. I recognized all these beings there in that Countenance. In his right hand I saw the gifts of his blessing and I saw in this hand Heaven opened, and all those who will be with him eternally. In his left hand I saw the sword of the fearful stroke with which he strikes all down to death. In this hand I saw Hell and all its eternal company. I have to speak to you for a moment Come. You no longer eat? I am abstaining, Mother. Abstinence, but not martyrdom. Here, eat this. Go on. I noticed a few weeks ago and I tried to moderate her excessive behavior, but you've seen, she deprives herself of food and protection from the cold is she keeps this up she is going to die. She is strongly bound to this behavior and I think it is a certain, manifestation of His love It is necessary, for her sake to rediscover the outside world the world will give her more opportunities than the monastery, to prove her love to God. Opportunities not of her choosing. Events It isn't necessary to be detached from the world. in order to be with God. Go get her. - Hello. - Hi. You don't obey. you reject the rules, but the rules protect us and guide us. You have no humility. For the moment, for me, you are a caricature of religion. God is not there. It is out of the question right now for you to speak your vows, and for you to stay here. Return to the world. Who knows? in the practice of everyday life your real life your true desires, your true self could perhaps be revealed. Go on, the convent doors will never be closed to you. Winter has come the unknown mother pushes me even more the sadness of her face that you are well loved, and close to us there is no reason for your sadness.

Excuse me, is that your dog? He's not bad. No. Come. - Yassine. - What are you doing here? - They told me you were here in the mosque. - Don't come here. Come on, let's go. Don't lie. This is the mosque not my home. Yes, I live here But it's not my place. Peace be upon you. Come on let's go. Come in. I want you to meet a friend. Hello Hi. - Do you drink tea? - Yes. - Bring two glasses. - Okay. - Please sit down. Aren't you going to serve. Pour me a little bit too. - So, is this the first time you've come here? - Yes, yes, yes. - Do you like it? - Yes. - It's pretty. - Have you seen our view? - Yes, it's cool. - We can see Paris. - How do you find it? - Well, its different, but... - Different? Than what? Then... ...what I know. You are from Paris? Yes. Yassine told me that you study theology? Yes. I am a Christian. Christian? Do you know about Islam, a bit? No really. Not really? Well if you are interested, I teach a class on religious reflection. Yes. Tomorrow. Tomorrow evening. If you are interested, you can come. You can laugh, that's my brother. Baa! Yes! Are you interested? Yes, of course. Its... Where? What, what do you do? Tomorrow we will cover a topic that you'd like to know, the notion of invisibility. That's right. A very important concept, I think for all religions but I'll talk about it particularly as it regards to Islam. - You will be welcome. - Well, thank you. Will you bring her? Will you bring her? - When? - Tomorrow - Yes of course, tomorrow then. But right now I must go... - ... I have a meeting. - Yes - I'll see you tomorrow. - Peace. - Peace. So I thought that - I would introduce you like I said last time - Yeah. He has a passion just like you. A love for Islam. and at the same time he is a good friend you can trust. - Do you like him? - Yes. Yeah me too, I'm happy. - I'll call you tomorrow, to take you to my brother's. - Okay. See you later. Wait there. - Hello. - Hello. - Is this the place where Nassir's class meets? - Yes back there. - In there? Well, what good is a notion if you forget it one week to another? Surah 6: Cattle. Because it contains the key to mystery. Surah 72: The Jinn Pardon me. Ah, hello miss. Come in. We have a guest today. She is not a Muslim but is welcome. Have a seat there. Perfect. Then I will continue: I will read Surah 72, verses 26 and 27. He knows the unseen, nor does he make anyone acquainted with his secrets, except a messenger Thus, "al-ghaib" comes from the verb "al-ghaiba", "ghaiba" which means "not here", "absent" We can translate it many ways into French: Absence, unknown, hidden, unseen. The invisible, what is this? God is both what is obvious and also what is hidden. More visible and more invisible. How can we think that these attributes are contradicting? God is present in his absence, it is when he is retired that he is manifested the most. And this is faith. To have confidence in what is not seen. What is happening here? Are you okay or what? Keep yourself silent please. I'm talking about something else that distracts your eyes. - Okay. How does God manifest himself? What's wrong? - I wasn't comfortable in there. - Why? Sit. Please tell me. Did I say something wrong? Don't cry. Is it because of that young man? I can't bear to look at another. Another to whom? Who? Other than Christ. It's nice what you say. I miss him. What do you mean? If you love him. Yes I love him. I love him and I know that he loves me. He has come to me often and made me understand what is love. That's what put you in this state? You should be happy. Yes, but then the world full of suffering. My heart... it makes me ill. I don't understand very well What's missing? His heart, his... It's not his heart that you love. It's everything. Him. You'll be fine. No. If you love him, he is there. Yes, he is there, I know. He is not absent. Yes. He is invisible. You know what I said earlier? He manifests where you are. If you have faith, if you love, then he is there, he is in you. It's happening here, now. We must do something. You must act if you have faith. you have to continue the Creator's work. He doesnt appear by staying still and suffering but from action in the world. Hey its red. Yassine! So what do you think. I'll see your brother, because theres something I want to say. What will you say? About live with God. I don't think so. I am in love with God Yassine, you know, you undertand. I am with him I feel him near me. Are you crazy or what? God is there. No, he is not there. He isn't there Yassine. I miss his love. It's like when you are in love with someone, you need to be with them. I'm not dead. But I can't live without his love. Do you love me or not? I just said, it is not an absence of a man what i have is from God. I believe you I want... The struggle is important. The struggle? Political action. Not violent. Nassir, why use a bomb? And what do you want me to tell you? The truth. The truth? Violence is natural, that is the order of things. And, we respond with our violence. What about the innocents and all that? What innocents? Do you think there are truly innocents in a democratic world where people elect their representatives? You also could kill for the humiliations of the world and of love for God? God is truth and justice, Celine. Peace is against justice. It's our struggle. But love? It's our faith, our aspiration to Him That is the struggle, Celine. The men are soldiers. Why not be a martyr? It's here. Your shelter? Where I am bound. Hadewijch. Hadewijch. It's pretty. Come on. Its looks nice here. I'm with you Nassir. I'm ready. Come on. We have a long way back. One final tour? Okay, the last. Then we go, we have nothing to do here. Yes I will go make the food. I'll come help you my sister. In fact, there isn't much to do. - Ok - Thank you. It's very kind. - Can you look for the ticket in my room. - I will. Its not there. How long for the food? - Three minutes - Ok. I'm getting hungry. You ok? - Yeah - Ok. You seem a little weird, eh? Do you want to break some eggs? No no no no no. What's wrong? I don't know. Go on. I'll bring it to the table. he just said there was a bombing. You'll see it So, my son... On Monday, Mom I go back to work. Be better when it has passed. Because you are not interested in doing wrong. Yes - Yes - Good Anyway, now you look after yourself, okay. I hope. Anyway you're not the first or the last. Well thats it. - After all you haven't killed anyone. - No. Good. Celine, don't cry. Don't cry. They've killed a little boy. Have you seen what I told you, have you? With your eyes, the humiliation. This is it. - Want some tea? - Yes. Thank you. I've told him about you. Do you want anything? God, our God, who has guided me to you. I am ready. In the vision of my life and my faults hiding in the action, close to my sisters and brothers. God can be wine. Acting in God and for Him. In the struggle, combat. So that He may live for us all. I believe there is a light that guides us, and in my action, the weapons of love, for Him He chose me and lit me. so i will do so. I am His. and subject to the mystery of his love and our union, who loves me well. Hadewijch. Come on young sisters. We are trapped. You know where we live... Someone wants to talk to you. Love your power divides us mine is the word. You are the light of the day and my days in the nights. Why? Why? I'm with you always following you Why run away from me? Being further and further away. you make me love so greatly but you wont be with a human creature.
