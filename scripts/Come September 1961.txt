Anna, please. I tried to tell him, very hard. - You heard me - What were you going to tell him? That he's not the man for me. He's always had everything his own way. He's arranged his life for his comfort, not mine. I don't intend to live like that - Then why didnt you tell him? - And spoil everything? Eleven months of the year, you're an intelligent, good business woman, successful. He comes here, and you havent got a brain in your head. Anna, do you know what it means to be happy? - Yes, of course. - But I mean, really happy? But that kind of happy only gets you In trouble. Guai, guai... Ma che guai? Lisa, listen to me. - Basta Permes so. - In due siete arrivati e non avete combinato niente! Ci devo pensare io? Spencer, I've thought about it I've made up my mind. I can't hurt you. It wouldn't be fair of me to marry you. But darling, don't you realise? Everything's arranged. My sisters have come all the way from London for this wedding. Theyre coming to meet you now. What on earth am I going to tell them? Tell them it's best for both of us. Theyll understand. Believe me, I know what you're just suffering from. Pre-marital nerves. I'm extremely nervous myself. I'll tell you. Yes, I've had some problems. My sisters... I had the deuce of job persuading them. it was the accepted thing nowadays for an Englishman to marry a foreigner. Here in Italy, Im not the foreigner. You and your sisters are foreigners. Yes, of course. I realize that but I wouldn't mention it to them. Theyre charming. I'm sure you'll like them when you meet them. - I'd rather not - Lisa, please. It wouldnt work I'd never be happy in England. You will, really, you will. England's not a bad old place. It's like a cold shower. Once you get used to it, you feel the better for it - I don't like cold showers. - Look darling, we'll compromise. Six months here and six months there. Oh, I can't live like a gypsy. Believe me, Spencer, I'm doing this for your own good. Some day, you'll meet girl who'll enjoy that cold shower with you. - Spencer - Wait, here are my sisters now. - Lisa, my sisters Katherine and Claire. - Goodbye. Via Bellagio 46.

Mr Talbot will be here any minute. Madonna mia. He'll find out We are lost God helps those who help themselves. Thee bedrooms. You, the bathrooms. Hide Cedric. Hurry up. Cedric... Teresa , Apri, apri, apri Arriva il Signore Talbot. - Maurice. - Mr. Talbot unexpected pleasure. - How are you? - A bit surprised. To see you In July. You never come till September. - I wish I'd known. - My telegram? - Telegram? No, sir. - I sent one. - Get In. - Yes, sir. - Isn't that a new colour? - Pardon? I said, Isn't that a new colour? Houses are like women, sir. The older they get, the more paint they need. - How's everything been? - Very quiet. Like turtles, we withdraw into our shells until you return. - What's that? - Sir? This... err... bougainvillea. it wasnt here last year, was it? Oh I've done a little... I've done a bit of landscapping. If your are displeased... Displeased? With what youve done with this place? You're more than a major-domo. You're a friend. I hope you'll continue to think that, sir. - Signor Clavell. Telegram. - Oh. Here, wait minute. I'll get it - Thank you. - Grazie. It's from me. I'm arriving today. That's the charm of Italy. It's the only country where a man can send a telegram and be sure he'll be there to receive it You know, I never realize now much I miss this place until I come back to it It's more than a villa. It's a refuge. It's where a man can... Lock out the rest of the world. - Will Miss... err...? - Yes. She'll be here. A man doesn't lock the whole world out Hello, Maria. ...Benedictus sanctus... Why Is she praying? A friend of hers, a very fine chap, Is passing through a severe crisis. - Well, I hope he makes it - No more than I do. I'll take your rooms to your bag. "La Dolce Vista"? Must be a new one. - Hello - Just get here? - Yes. - You'll like it - What's that? - Girls. I know. Whatre they doing here? Sir, if you could have seen them. Students on tour In a strange land, their tiny bus disabled. Theyll be gone In the morning. Theyre staying here tonight? I know I should have turned them away, but the quality of mercy's not strained. It's being strained right now. Why not send them to a hotel? There Isnt a vacant In town. But if you Insist, I'll tell them to leave. Well, they have to go somewhere. What about this new place? La Dolce Vista. - Full up, sir. - Well, they cant stay here. - Check around and find something. - Yes, sir. Maurice Oh, we had a splendid hike. Quite exhilarating. Miss Allison, Miss Stevens. Mr. Talbot - How do you do? - How do you do? - HI. - Miss Allison is the girls' chaperone. - Where's Cedric? - I had him carried up to your bedroom. - Oh, splendid? - Err... Who's Cedric? - Miss Allison's parakeet. - This is such a lovely place. And the view from the terrace quite breath-taking. Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me. Maurice, make the ladies comfortable. Well, really He acts as though he owns the place. - I was hoping he'd be better this year. - What's wrong with him? This is a story I wish I didn't have to tell. Years ago, his family owned this place. There were financial reverses, they lost it - That's when you bought it - Yes. Then the war came along. He was standing sentry duty at an ammunition dump. - Blew up. - Really? - It left him traumatised. - You will not look at him?. No, It's like looking at a magnificent castle, with a weak tower. Isn't it dangerous to have him roaming in the house? No, no, no. He's absolutely harmless except for one small mental quirk He thinks he still owns the place. I let him come every year to stay a while. It seems to calm his nerves. If he says something unusual, just play along. - What an Interesting case history. - Has he any money? Only his government pension. Naturally, I do what I can. Oh, Maurice I think that's why I'm so fond of you. You're always thinking of others. I think a psychiatrist would help him. Undoubtedly. But It's none of your affair. Sandy's a major In psychology. She's quite a fanatic on the subject - Dear child. - Maurice. - Have these shined, will you? - Yes, sir. - Draw my bath. Lay out my clothes. - Yes, sir. - Analysis would help him. - Or good talking to. He may be shell-shocked, but he's not helpless. The ideal treating you as if you were his servant Hello. Hello. - Mr. Talbot? - Have you owned this place very long? - Quite some time. - You must be very proud of it - Yes, I am. Unfortunately, since the war, I've only been able to come here once a year. - It must have been a terrible war. - They usually are. Yes... I'd like to talk to you about it some time. - About what? - The war. - The war? - Yes. I have a feeling I can help. I doubt it It's over. - What are you doing? - You told me to lay out... All right, I'll do it. Get on the phone and find a place for those women. - Yes, Sir. Come In. - Mr. Talbot? - Yes. - I was wondering if we could talk now? - I'm... Please, It's terribly important Why dont you sit down? No, no, not there. On the couch. What do you mean? Now try and relax. Lie down. - Lie down? - It's for your own good. There. Really, Mr. Talbot You must try and relax. Now. Where would you like to begin? I really don't know. Where would you suggest? Well... Let's start with... the war. That war really... bothers you, doesn't it? You were In the Army. I thought I was In the Navy. No, you were In the Army. Standing sentry duty... at an ammunition dump that blew up. Do you remember that? All I remember Is being officer In a PT boat. Dont you see? Thats your subconscious substituting fantasy for fact. Look... Thats why you think you own this place. Don't I? No. Really, Mr. Talbot You must face reality. Your family lost this house, Mr. Cavell bought it, turned it Into a hotel. - A hotel? - La Dolce Vista? - That's right. - People pay him to stay here? - Yes. It's a hotel. You don't know how happy you've made me. I knew I could help you. Oh, you have. Suddenly, all the pieces have fallen Into place. Mr. Cavell will be so thrilled you've recovered. - I'll go tell him. - No, no, no. Let me tell him. You can tell Maria to stop praying. Her friend didn't survive the crisis. Excuse me. I have some duties. A major-domo's day Is never done. Yours Is. Don't think of your self as a major-domo. More like a sentry at an ammunition dump that's about to blow up. - Your room or mine? - Yours. - You're a thief. - Yes, sir. - And a liar. - Yes, sir. Completely untrustworthy. Thief and a liar, yes. But not untrustworthy. I really don't think this is the proper time to talk the matter out Not while your mind is bristling with negative thoughts. I havent even begun to bristle. - Turning my house Into a hotel. - How easy for you to say "my house". - You're never here. - What's that to do with it? When her windows are stuck do you care? No, you're In New York I, Maurice, have to unstick them. On a cold night when her radiators knock are you here? No, I have to warm them up. And when her plumbing goes out who's there to unclog her? Maurice. You're like a husband who's only with his wife one month a year. It's the man who's with her the rest of the year deserves the credit Well, I dont care for what youve turned my wife Into. - What have I done with the profit? - That's a good question. Painted her. Put In a new garden wall, a fountain, a patio. - I even replenished the wine cellar. - Not to mention your wallet. Any personal gain was of secondary importance. Your smile of appreciation when you came here every year. That was my real... my real reward. Tell your guests to find themselves another hotel. As for you and your accomplices, pack your bags and leave in the morning. Sir, I wish you'd sleep on that decision. Tomorrow, we'll probably both laugh about this matter. We might both be laughing. But not In the same house. Sir, may I please ask one last favor? Margaret, the chaperone. She's been coming with tourists for some time. We've become rather close, even made plans for the future. She thinks I'm the owner. Will you please let me explain it to her In my own way? All right. But I have the feeling I'm not doing Margaret any favor. Thank you. I'll talk to her right away. We should be leaving in about half an hour to pick up Ms. Fellini at the station. I'll pick her up my self. Please, sir. As long as I'm here, I'd like to attend to my duties. Just for my own Information, how long has this been a hotel? Six years. it was a fine hotel, sir, with a Triple A rating. Conrad Hilton would have been proud to own it I'm surprised you didn't sell it to him. The deed Is In your name. Che piacere rivederla, signorina. - Grazie Maurice. - What did he say? - That It's nice to see me. - Oh. - La trovo bene, Maurice. - Lisa, please. - Don't pat the servants. - Maurice? He's more than a servant Yes, I found that out today. Keep your eyes on the road. Robert, you're terribly sharp with Maurice. What's wrong? How would you feel if you found out Brutus was your major-domo? Lucrezia Borgia your cook and Benedict Arnold your upstairs maid? Cos'hal combinato? Questa villa resta vuota Un dici mes al l'anno. Al lora mi son detto: "Che peccato, perch non convertirla In un albergo?" - A hotel - Filled with tourists. Look... He even advertises. Don't laugh, you'll encourage him. C' solo una povera vecchia con sei hambin Indifes. E lui Il butta fuori, sulla strada. - vero? - vero. - I can't believe it - What? That you could be so cruel, to throw out on the street an old woman and six helpless children. - Theyre not children, they're... - What? - Not children. - Chie devo solo di lasciarli una notte. Se ne vada domattina. Why cant they stay one night? They are leaving In the morning. I don't want anybody there tonight. Do you? Roberto, what can one night hurt? - Ha ragione, cosa importa... - You keep out of this. - Dont you listen to him. - I've never seen you like this before. - You're upset. - Of course I'm upset. It's 10 months since we had seen each other. - Whose fault Is that? - Mi fa male sentirvi litigare. Isn't he sweet? He said it upsets him to hear us argue. Theres nothing to argue about He's already told them to leave. You did tell your friend Margaret, didnt you? Come potevo? Stava facendo Il bagno, non siamo poi cos tanto amici. Dont talk to her, talk to me. - What's the big joke? - He said, how could he tell her? She was taking a bath, and they're not that friendly. I don't think that's funny. Mi preoccupa. Ha perso tutto Il suo spirito. He said he's worried about you. You've lost your sense of humour. Well, I'll get it back when he leaves. I don't think you should go In with me. Why not? The hotel guests. How will it look if we come In together? All right. I'll park the car and come In through the servants' entrance. I wouldn't want you to lose your Triple A rating. Oh, Miss Allison. Signorina Fellini. - Buon giorno . - Good afternoon. - Who's she? - A school teacher. She doesn't look like a school teacher. Margaret, If beauty symbolizes occupation, I would mistake you for a star from the cinema Maurice - Oh, not now. - Why not? - She's taking a shower. - Who Is? - Sandy. - Sandy? The girl with whom I share the room. - You're rooming with someone? - I'll kill that Maurice. - It's not his fault If he moved everyone around so I could be alone In the room next to yours, how would it look? You'd better leave. - We'll have dinner on my terrace. - There Isn't room for nine people. - What nine people? - Theyll suspect if we eat alone. Hurry, she might see you. Be careful. What am I sneaking around for? It's my... - Shhi ...house. You'd better wait Miss Allison hasn't made her bed-check. And she's already suspicious. - Of what? - You and Mr. Talbot - What about us? - Dont get me wrong. I think It's terribly exciting. All the girls do. Two people In love. In a romantic place like this. It's the dreamiest thing I've ever heard of. I'm going downstairs to get some warm milk. Warm milk? He looks more like the champagne type to me. Good night, girls. Lights out now. Err... I was just going downstairs... to get some warm milk. I got the warm milk. - Sandy. - Yes, ma'am. Lights out now. - Good night, girls. - Good night. She'll be asleep In ten minutes. So will I. But he's waiting for you. I can hear the music. I really don't know where a girl your age gets Ideas like that I have no Intention of going to Mr. Talbot's room. I'm going... Yes, I'm going to finish my milk and go to sleep. Good morning. - Morning? - What happened to last night? - Everybody looked suspicious. And Sandy knew about us. I couldn't leave. it would've been too obvious. Sandy seems to know about everything. Now I know what she's doing In Europe. Her neighbors decided to chip In and send her. - What's that? - Theyre getting ready to leave. Good. I promised to come down and say goodbye. Oh, send them a letter. - It'll only take a minute - No, Lisa, come on. - I think you should come and say goodbye too. - I'll wave to them from the terrace. Teenagers are like the H-bomb. When they go off, It's much better to observe them from a distance. - Bye, Mr. Talbot - Bye - Goodbye, Mr. Talbot - Bye, Mr. Talbot Good morning, sir. Your orange juice. Not orange juice, Maurice, champagne. It's a special occasion. The hotel Is closing, you're packing, and the guests are leaving. How often does a man get rid of all his troubles at the same time? Oh, what's the matter? I don't understand, Miss Allison. What are you doing In traction? Slipped on a champagne cork? it was an accident I've sprung my sacroiliac. Mm? No, I've had this happen before. Don't worry, I'll be absolutely splendid by the morning. The girls cant go without her. You will have to let them stay until tomorrow You wouldnt think a cork this small could lay out woman that big. Maria, move Miss Fellini's luggage into Miss Allison room. - Teresa and... - Milena, sir. Start making sandwiches. Lots of them. Mr. Cavell will need all of his strength. - Where am I going? - On a long hike. With the girls. You're going to show them Italy. All of it. if you run out of Italy, show them Sicily. That ought to take you all the day. And a good part of the night, sir. I'm glad we understand each other. It's a shame the girls have no place to go today. They do. Theyre going on a long hike. Shouldnt we offer to go with them? Maurice already volunteered. Do you want to go? Hiking could never replace this. Oh, Robert One, two, three, four, ready, set... - Hey, two, three, four... - Hup - Hup - Two, three, four... - Hup Hup Hup Hup - Hey What's going on here? Observe. Hey, look. It's Barney Oldfield. - Catch, Beagle. - Hey, two, three, four... - What are you doing here? - This is the Hotel Dolce Vista, right? - Not any more. - We got reservations. - Theyre cancelled. - Hold this. - I got written confirmation from the manager. - He's cancelled it too. Sorry. - All right, out - Hey, wait a minute. Hold it Hey, Beagle. You're gonna be a lawyer, right? Can he do this to us? In 1937, there was the case of Wilson against the Waldorf Astoria. - And? - He can do it to us. - Good day, gentlemen. - Yeah. Let's go. Beagle, give me a coin. Hey... That's for parking In your driveway. We end up In a stream first, then we're tossed out of our hotel. - Maybe this country's unlucky. - We could be In France In a few hours. - These In favor of leaving, say "Aye'. - Aye - These In favor of staying, say "Aye'. - Aye Aye - Theyre backing up. - Don't look around. - Which one did you like? - I didn't notice. - The driver was cute. Nice blue eyes. - Theyre brown and keep away from him. Err... Bongiorno. Bongiorno. - This one Is mine, huh? - Tell 'me we wanna be friends. Just wait a minute, let me handle it and we'll all make out Where do you live? Sausalito. And where Is that near? San Francisco. I am very stoopid. But I'm loads of fun. - We're from Connecticut - Where are you staying? Hotel La Dolce Vista. Well, Isn't that coincidence? We're staying right outside the gate. - But theres nothing there. - Give us 20 minutes, will you? See you. Call the police. I want them picked up for trespassing. Unfortunately, sir, It's not your property. Theyre like spiders. And they've got the flies helping them put up their web. - Why arent those flies out hiking? - They Insisted on going to help out The moment I saw you, just came out of my shell. Well, yes, but you know I really think we ought to go help the others, Tony. - Say that again. - What? My name. Tony. Once more. Tony. Theres something about that boy I don't trust. I dont care how you do it, I want you... - Ciao! - What's she doing down there? Goodbye, I'll see you later. Ciao, ciao! La, la, la, la La la Il, la la, la la La, la, la, la What were you doing down there? Darling, you're going to be so proud of me. I've arranged everything. - Like what? - La, la, la, la... - Like what? - The boys need kerosene. - Why? Who are they planning to burn? - It is for the stove. - Theyre very nice American boys. - So was the Dalton gang. The boys are hurt They think you don't like them. Theyre right. Theyre college students on their first vacation in Europe. Go...Make friends. - I don't want to make friends. - I don't understand you. - Theyre sweet. - Sweet. - Yes - Yes. Do you know what the boys are going to do with the girls this afternoon? No. What are the boys going to do with the girls this afternoon? Well, I thought, those girls have nothing to do. These boys have nothing to do. So, they could use the sun terrace. - But Robert wouldn't like that - No, Robert wouldn't like that Then I said to my self, "Wouldn't it be nice if they all rented motors scooters and went for a ride In the country?" That's what you said to your self. Did you say it to them? Oh, yes. The boys said it sounded like it would be a lot of fun. Well, that sounds like the boys. - Mr. Cavell. - Sir? Go with them and you are not to let those girls out of your sight. - Sir, I can't ride a motor scooter. - Then learn. I have no sense of balance. I was the only child, I had to be strapped to my tricycle. - I won't let them go out alone. - Robert Lisa, please. I don't know how I let myself get talked Into all of this, but I'm In it It's not his hotel, It's my home. I am the one legally responsible. - I fully expect your friend, err... - Margaret. ...to sue me the minute she goes out. - She wouldn't. I can be sued for sprung sacroiliac I can go to jail for what can happen to those girls. What can happen to them? There are four boys and six girls. That adds up to ten. And there's safety In numbers. Theres more to mathematics than adding. These boys look quite capable of dividing and multiplying Oh Oh They purposely took this road. Theyre trying to shake us. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty well shook. All right, so It's my fault I said I'm sorry. You'd be more comfortable if you put your head against me. - What did you wish for? - It's very bad luck to tell. I hope you get what you want That sure Is sweet of you. You know, this Is a side of you I've never seen before. What Is? This protective attitude towards women. Women? Theyre only 18. Children, no older than my niece. - So? - So? So? Would I let my niece go out with guys like that? I know those boys. I know that's on their mind. Robert, you have a moral streak. You know me better than that Hey, Beagle Beagle - What? - Look. A Papilio glaucus. Thatd look great In your butterfly collection. - What butterfly collection? - The one you're starting, now. - Oh. - Come on, it went that way. - Now, just a minute here. - You wait here In case it doubles back. Tony, are you sure that butterfly's gonna come here? Positive. When you're followed, you instinctive find a place where nobody can find you. - This Is it - You do know a lot about butterflies. It's what we study In medical school: Insects, animals, people. You'd be surprised how similar we are In many ways. Oh? Well, did you know that beetles actually kiss? - No. - Sure. How? The boy beetle rubs his antenna against the girl beetle. And what does the girl beetle do? If he doesn't rub her the wrong way, they make plans for the future. Like tonight. Medicine's a fascinating field. That's why a woman like Lisa so interesting. Lisa? There are 206 bones In the human body. I've never seen them that way arranged before. Oh. - She sure Is a beautiful specimen. - Yes, she Is. For her age. - I am sorry. I didn't mean to be catty. - Don't be sorry. She Is, she's very beautiful. - She really Is. How would you say I'm arranged? - You? - Yeah. I never gave it much thought. You've got good basic bone structure. Let me see. Nice rib cage. Fibula. Tibias good. Ah, well-developed patellas. Uh-huh. Mm-hm. Uh-huh. Good. Very good. Excellent Good strong heartbeat. - Isn't that strange? - What? Your pulse, it suddenly started to race. - Did it? - It's swung down now. There it goes again. it doubled back. Oh, err... Tony was just examining my bone structure. He's studying to be a doctor. Where does he plan to Intern? At the Follies Bergres? I don't want to Interfere with medical progress, but were ready to leave. After you, Doctor. - Hey, Beagle. Is this it? - Yes, sir Here we go I thought you said he'd never make it up this hill. All right, so we get him on the next hill. He's killing the whole day for us. What about tonight? The girls are leaving In the morning. Beagle, will you relax? We'll get rid of him. I don't know. This Is no kid we're fooling with. That's the answer, he's no kid. Look he's got a be over 35. How many hills can he take? I don't know. He looks pretty rugged to me. Yeah, In his day, Beagle. The B-29 was a rough plane, but it cant keep up with a guided missile. When they wheel him Into the hanger tonight, his tail Is really gonna be dragging. - Theyre out to get me. - Get you what? - Get rid of me. - Do you blame them? - Don't start that - It's natural, they want to be alone. - Have you forgotten what that's like? - What's that supposed to mean? Theyre normal, healthy boys and normal, healthy girls. No? That can lead to a normal, unhealthy situation. Yes, believe me. I know what I'm doing. - Robert, you're breaking the spirit. - Yeah The guy's not human. When I couldn't push my scooter up that last hill... ...he carried it up for me. - It's spooky. - Look, Let's be rational. How old are we, anyway? I feel like I'm 92. We're 20 and he's pushing 40. That's ancient We're young, we can bounce back. He's probably laying In his room right now, like a lead ball. Anybody here? The girls tell me we're all going dancing tonight. We'll be ready to leave In about an hour. Multiplication, that's the name of the game And each generation plays the same Isn't he terrific? When you see a gentleman bee Round a lady bee buzz in;, Why, count to ten Then count again There's sure to be an even dozen Multiplication, it's the name of the game And each generation plays the same Now two butterflies cast their eyes Both In the same direction Why you'd never guess that one little yes Could start a butterfly collection Multiplication, that's the name of the game And each generation plays the same I say one and one are five Call me a silly goat But you take two minks You add two winks What've you got? One mink coat A girl gets coy In front of a boy after three or four dances Well, you can bet shell play hard to get To multiply her chances Multiplication, that's the name of the game And each generation plays the same Let me tell you now Mother Nature's a clever gal She relies on habits Take two hares with no cares Soon you got a room full of rabbits Parakeets, In between tweets, sometimes get too quiet But have no fear, soon you hear A parakeets riot, try it Multiplication is the name of the game And each generation plays the same Multiplication is the name of the game And each generation plays the same It's respect. That's what girl wants from a boy. if the girl gives In too easy, the boy will not take her seriously He ll never think In terms of engagement, marriage, a home, or children. if you want all these things, keep your standards high. The bedroom's like a wedding gown, It's bad luck to let the fellow see you In it before you marry him. Isn't he fabulous? How does he do it? He's going on raw courage now. Remember. The night Is young, he's not Well, if youre old enough to fly, you're old enough to look. Mr. Talbot? Mr. Talbot sir? What do you what? We'd like to speak to you for a minute, sir. It's terribly important - Ill be right down. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. You told the girls to be ready In an hour, right? He's a weirdie Hes just as fresh as when we started out Beagle... Beagle, No man his age can defy the laws of medical science. He's traveled on a motor scooter for over 100 miles, half of it straight up. He's been on a dance floral night, knocking himself out He's had it. Come here. It's medically proven that to put said subject to sleep at this point, It's only necessary to Introduce into the system some drops of monatomic di carbon hydroxyl. What's that? Booze. Just few drinks, we're home. - You're the king. - Thank you. Observe. Hold it, now. Yes? Excuse me Sir, since we're leaving early in the morning, we thought wed like to come by and apologise to you. Oh. I know we've created a terrible impression, we've been rude and unpleasant, in fact, sometimes downright boorish. May we come In for a moment, sir? Thank you, sir. Thank you. Mr. Talbot We just couldn't leave without trying to square things with you. - I see. - No hard feelings? - Not at all. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. What did you say, Beagle? Do you know what an occasion like this calls for? A drink. - Yeah. - You're right. He's right, sir. May we have a farewell drink together? - Sure. Let's do. - Thank you, sir. Beautiful villa you have, Mr. Talbot Now, then. What would you boys like to drink? - A brandy. - Brandy? Fine. A toast, sir. May this night be an example of the friendship. between your generation and ours. And another toast, sir. May these drinks wash away the past and ensure the future. To a little insurance. Now, then... Well, sir. I'd like to propose a toast. To what? You name it - Well... - How do you feel? Fine. Sir, do you realize that you are defying the laws of medical science? Dr. Lister and Louis Pasteur. And, err... Madame Curie. All our work, sir, Is for nothing. I'm sorry. Some unfinished business I had to attend to. Robert What's wrong? - What's happened? - I got'em Every last one of 'em. Tony? Tony What happened? Tony Tony Hmm? Tony? Are you all right? Course I'm all right. A little wet, that's all. Come on, try and stand up. Now see if you can walk. Course I can walk. How do you feel? What happened? Mr. Talbot... He called us In, and then he forced us to drink with him. Tony... If I could only lie down for minute, I'd feel fine. I know it Do you want to go In the house? No, I... I'd better not I'd better go back to the tent - Tony - Mm? I need a little help. Robert How could you do this? I was only following their golden rule. Do unto others before they do it to you. You can't let them lie there all night. Maurice can sweep 'em out In the morning. Look...dont feel sorry for them. They got exactly what they are deserved. - Somebody has to look after the girls. - Is it not their parentsresponsibility? The trouble with the American parents is, they have a new gimmick. "Keep your kids off the streets. Send them to Europe." Theyre turning this continent Into one big corner drugstore. - It's gone. - What? Theres a body missing. The one body I don't want to have missing. Sandy wait, I was drunk, I swear. I didnt even know what I was doing. The next time I see a man lying in the bar, I will leave him there. - Mr.Talbot, Did you force him to drink with you? - Of course not. And that's a lie. - Sandy, honey... - Sandy... Thank you. You've reaffirmed my lack of confidence In my fellow man. - Sandy? - Mm? Are you all right? Oh, sure. He's cute, Isn't he? - Who? - Tony. Hope I didn't loosen any teeth when I hit him. He has a beautiful smile. - You're not mad at him? - Mad? Why would I be mad at him? Wait, wait... - He got fresh. You hit him. - You're not mad? - No. - You like him? - Adore him. Eh gil Sicuro! The business psychiatrists must do In America You people are all mixed up. You see, when he got fresh, it showed he was Interested. - I had to ensure he stayed Interested. - So you hit him. It's like Mr.Talbot said. A girl has to make a boy respect her. If she gives in easily, he will never take her seriously. Oh. - He said that? He's right. He said, "When you go shopping In a market, you don't buy anything that's been there too much." - When did Mr.Talbot tell you all this? - While we were dancing. He said: "if you want man to think in terms of getting engaged and married, you got to keep your standards high." What else did he say? He said that love Is one product you don't sell by giving away free samples. That's a good advice for all of us. You listen to him. I can tell you, he knows what he's talking about I know. Well? I guess you learned something tonight, huh? Yes. I never realized how wrong I was. - It's all In the past now. - You're so right. You know, It's been a long day. Some champagne would do us both the world of good. - The bottle's on the terrace. - I'll go get it - Robert When you get to the terrace, would you do me a favor? - Sure. - Jump off. - What are you doing? - Taking your advice. If a woman is too easy to get, no man will ever take her seriously. When I think how easy I was. Stupida Cretina Idiota - Something I told some young girls. - To protect their morals. What about my morals? What's that got to do with it? We're adults. - Lisa, look. You just calm down. - Don't touch me. How could I be that stupid? You are rich, good looking Intelligent, charming. I should have known better than to get mixed up with someone like that You're not making any sense. I don't have to make sense. I'm Italiani Ci sono uomini pi Interessanti di te In Italia. Sono stufa degil american. Stufa Talk English I can't understand you. That's another thing. if you loved me, you'd have learned my language. But no. I had to do it The weeks I spent studying. Learning to speak this fluid English. Not fluid, fluent Big shot Knows all the words. For the first time, I started to think What am I doing here? Lisa, believe me, no love affair can survive if either party starts to think. That's the beauty of our relation ship. No thinking. - No pressure, no questions asked. - It's time someone asked questions. I knew those girls would get me In trouble. You're a hypocrite. You made all the rules and I play by them. - Now I know what you think of me. - Lisa. Well, the game Is over, Robert I dont want to play any more. - If you just calm down. - I'm tired of being a free sample. - Theres no future In it - We never even talked about the future. Women don't want talk. They go by Intuition. And I've learned one thing. A womans Intuition Is a man's best friend. - Lisa, wait. - The market's closed, Mr. Talbot. You have to start shopping somewhere else. Lisa. Lisa Who's In that tent? Boys. Boys? Watch your head, my dear. - Did my girls meet them? - Meet whom? - Those boys down In the tent - Oh, those boys. Yes. They weren't Interested In feminine companions. Theyre too absorbed by the educational aspects of the tour. It's too bad you won't have time to meet them. Fine, clean-cut young Americans. True goodwill ambassadors of a great nation. - Which way's the tent? - What happened to the girls? I don't know. Man, what a night. - Maurice - Dear, I'm as shocked as you are. If anything's happened to those girls... Margaret, believe me, please Nothing happened. Absolutely nothing, I'm sure. I hope not. Remember... I left to the girls In your care. Oh Cedric - He hiccupped. - He did. Cedric He's drunk Maurice What kind of party did you have here last night? - Lisa, come back here - I said, dont touch me Wait until everybody's gone. We can talk like adults. I don't want to talk like an adult That's how I got Into all this trouble. - How will you get back? There's no train. - I'll walk. - You are very welcome to come with us. - Thank you. You keep out of this. Lisa, dont you walk out that door. What would I lose? Thef privilege of seeing you every September? Well, I'm tired of being girl of the month. - You know you're more than that - Don't worry, Robert You won't have any trouble. Just put an ad In the paper. Girl wanted. Short hours, pleasant working conditions. Theres only one drawback. Theres no chance of advancement Wild parties, immoral rendezvous... And to think I trusted you Next, I'll find out this Isnt even a hotel. That's precise the next thing you're about to find out - Sir. - You're fired. And you, madam, take those girls of yours, pack that drunken bird, and get out Are you going to allow him to speak to me like that? Margaret, theres a small detail I probably should have mentioned before now. I know you are going to take it with your customary good sense of humor. Margaret, Listen to me Where's that good sense of humour? Margaret Sandy Honey, listen... Hey, Sandy - I'm packed, sir. - Goodbye, Mr. Clavel. - Before I leave, can I get you breakfast? - No. - Yes. Get me an olive. - A martini for breakfast? Great for the morning after. Especially if there hasn't been a night before. Yes, sir. Oh, before I forget, would you kindly sign this, sir? - What Is it? - A letter of recommendation. A letter of recommendation? I didn't want to trouble you, so I took the liberty of writing it out myself. Just sign here. It's much too trivial for you to bother reading, sir. "Loyal... ...faithful, dedicated, noble." "Reputable. Incorruptible." it does get rather monotonous. Nearly saint-like in his devotion to his master. Yes, sir. Nobody who believes this deserves you. Thank you very much, sir. I'll get the olive. May I speak to you a moment, sir? Well, If it Isn't the prowling physician. I don't blame you, sir. The way I acted with Sandy, I'm no credit to the medical profession. Hardly. I came to apologise, sir. No gimmicks this time. You had us pegged right from the beginning. That's probably why we got so sore at you. - Sir, do you know what a lemming is? - No. Well, It's an animal that destroys itself. I gotta look up my family tree, there must be some real lemmings in it I meet a great girl like Sandy and what do I do? I goofed the whole thing up. I acted just like a stupid adolescent I'm not a kid any more, I know better than that - I'm getting on In years. - You are not exactly ancient. When a guy gets as old as I am, you'd think he'd be smart enough to stop fooling around and look for lasting relationship. Once In a while, if you're lucky, you come across something of real value. And what do you do? Treat it like a bargain basement speola. You start grabbing it And you lose it You spend your life shopping around for something that's not even half as good. Anyhow, I came by to say, I'm sorry. So long, Mr. Talbot Tony. Yes, sir? Err... Have a nice trip. Thank you, sir. Thank you. - Here you are, sir. - Mr. Clavell. just learned something. I'm a lemming. You really should have something more substantial for breakfast. You know man Is the only animal clever enough to build the Empire State Building and stupid enough to jump off it - Get the car, Maurice. - Yes, sir - I dont see them. - Sparrow, stop worrying - He'll follow us. - Who? Tony. You don't think I'd have left If I didnt think he'd come after me? And don't you worry. Mr. Talbot will come after you too. Believe me, Sandy, I couldn't care less. A $20,000 car Isn't supposed to get a flat Evident, the manufacturers felt the same way. Theres no jack to change the tyre. There must be a garage around here someplace. Va; vial Dov' il garage pl vicino? They don't know. I'll ask Inside. You there, I want to borrow your truck. MI spiace, ma non capisco. I want to borrow your truck. I'll pay you for it Non posso. It's an emergenoy. I'll buy it, here. Ma questo camion non mica mio. Perch mi ha dato questo denaro? Non mio. - Get In. - Theres a garage. - Never mind, get In. - In this? Va bene. Va bene. Eh, il mio camion Eccolo l Fermati Calmati, figlio mio. Chiamiamo la polizia adesso. There they are, sir. - Here, take this bird. - Take the wheel. Lisa - What? - Stop the bus - I want to talk to you. - Go away. I've been thinking. You want me to take you seriously? OK. I take you serious. It's too late. What do you want me to do, marry you? - OK, I'll marry you. - You sound like you do me a favor. I'm not doing you any favor by marrying you. if you'd asked me when we first met, or last year, or even yesterday. We never spoke of marriage. We were happy. I always feel I forced you Into it - Do I sound like I'm being forced? - You dont seem happy about it I've never been happier. Look damn it, I'm smiling. it would never work Lisa, I'm asking you In a nice way. Now stop being an Idiot Get off that blasted bus and marry me No OK, don't ever say I never asked you. You're a witness. You heard me ask her. - Dont stop now, sir. Follow them. - No, Maurice. I'm like this goose. I know when I've laid an egg. I want that villa put up forsale. And if you can't sell it, burn it I've had it with this country. Thais Is no time to burn your villas behind you. - She loves you. She wants to marry you. - She has a funny way of showing it Italian women are emotional. She's been hurt She wants time to think. I want to go back to America, where people get married without thinking. Eccolo l camion Arresta ue? - What are they saying? - They say we stole his truck. His truck? That's ridiculous. Tell them I bought it, paid $600 for it Yes, we admit it We stole this truck. It was his Idea. I never stole any thing In my life. Thais Isnt the first car he's stolen. Tell them that's my car over there. He stole that one, too. I resent being treated like a memberof the Mafia. He's a member of the Mafia. What are they doing? Maurice, tell them who I am. This Is Robert Talbot The most wanted criminal In Europe. That's right. They probably want some money. Offer them a bribe. He says you'll never collect the big reward. He's wanted In Rome... five million lire. You know the police In the big cities. if they come after him, they end up with the reward. The way to make sure you get it, Is to take him to Rome personal. - Did you tell them about the money? - Theyre definitely Interested. The time I wasted on him. For the hypocrite, a liar, a fraud. You are fortunate. Most women find it out after they are married. I'm lucky to get man like Spencer. He's honest, sincere, sympathetic... ...err... reliable Everything Robert Isn't. But at least Robert did me one favor. - He did? - He asked me to marry him. He begged me. And that freed me of him forever. Now I know I can be happy with Spencer. Where are they taking us? We've been riding for hours. I wish I knew, sir. I don't understand it They act like I'm a criminal. I've noticed that, sir. Hey Metti gi le mani Tell him I'd like to explain everything very carefully. Yes, sir. He says he Is ready to make a full confession. Now, there's this girl, Lisa Fellini. There Is this girl, Lisa Fellini. Tell them she was my house guest. She Is his chief accomplice. She lives here In Rome, via Bellaglo, 46. She Is hiding out In Rome... at via Bellaglo, 46. We had an argument, a lover's quarrel. I was trying to keep her from leaving. Theres a big reward for her. Hey If I only had my lawyer here. Believe me, what I'm doing for you, no lawyer could ever do. You didnt see Lisa at her best the other day. Once you get to know her, you'll love her. She's a shy, gentle girl. Very quiet, well-bred and home-loving. Lasciatem andare! Lasciatem andare! Sono Innocente! Mascalzoni I don't like making snap decisions, Spencer, but do you think this Is the right girl for you? Robert Signorina Theres this man I met about eight months ago. Spencer. He's been very nice to me and... Non lo so. I don't want to sue anybody for false arrest. just want to get out of here. if there's a plane, a train, a bus, or jackass leaving this city, get me on it - Theres a train leaving for Milan in just about an hour. - Fine. Get me a taxi. Let me tell you about Italian women. Theyre not to be trusted. - Deceitful, emotionally unstable. - Doesn't that apply to all the women? Of course, it does. That's where they've got us. Nothing else to replace them with. - At least you go down to the station and apologise. - I'll write to them. Cafoni First, You say you don't love me, spend two nights at a man's villa, finally, when you return you're arrested. I can't allow this to go on after were married. Come along. Hello? Yes, Maurice.

He didn't follow me I'm going home tomorrow and he doesnt even have my phone number. - I know I'll never see him again. - Dont worry. Lisa, I don't want to lose him. I'm 18, I may never have another chance. - Of course you will. - No, I'm going to end up like you. Marrying the wrong man and miserable with someone I don't love. Non sense, I'm very happy with Spencer. Now, listen. Do you know where the boys were going? Yes, but what good Is it? It's like Mr. Talbot said. It's wrong for woman to chase a man. He won't respect her. Forget Mr. Talbot Listen to him and you'll ruin your life. But you told me he was right. You said you were taking his advice. Did I? I don't remember. Now, where were the boys going? Paris. The Deauville Hotel. Hotel Deauville In Paris. Internazionale prego. - You're calling Tony. - Lisa... I want the Hotel Deauville In Paris. - When they answer, ask for him. - Do you think I should? Of course It's like fighting a war. If you retreat and the enemy doesn't follow you, you've got to turn around and attack. What good Is winning the battle if you lose the war? Aspetta un momen to. Why be miserable with someone you don't love? Betterto be miserable with someone you do love. Hello? Hello. Paris. Yes, Hotel Deauville. Yes, I'll hold on. - Miss Fellini.

E il padre di questo bambino sta partendo. Mascalzone americano! - America no? - America no d'America. Se lei non mi fa passare, quello l se ne val I can't let you leave without even talking to her. She's got that little something extra. That little something extra. This could never happen In England. It's this beastly climate. - Eccolo! - lui? - Il pap. - L'americano? Ci penso io.
