All you do is close your eyes and pucker up. Like this. Mm-mm. We wanna see what's down there. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Come on, lover boy. That's it? Looks like an acorn! - Mmm... - Hey, come back! Come back! Come back, lover boy! Bye! See you soon! Help... Please... Please help... I'm sorry! What... I was kidding. No... No! Please! I'll do whatever you want! I'm sorry! Please... I'm begging you, I'm begging you! No, no, please! ...Well? "All right"? Honey, this here is some Grade A prime rib. We've been over this. I don't have a choice. You could always sell drugs. Oh, my God, what are you... Go back to your computer, I wasn't done with my show. Uh, okay, then get in here and close the door, I'm buck naked. Well, you better get used to it. - It is your new business attire. - Joke all you want, but it's either this or drop out of school. I thought you said your mom could swing it? The tuition and her mortgage? I mean... Not without my dad's income. Not for long. Well, breaking news for ya, there are other ways a gal can earn cash besides flashing her vertical smile all over cyberspace. Look, Kylie, you're better than this... and I strongly doubt your dad would approve. All right, look; t's not prostitution, or even stripping. There's no sleazy men slipping singles into my g-string while copping a feel. Yeah, but it's porn, Kylie! Technically. But it's not like skanky Boogie Nights porn. I mean, it's just me and a few unmanned cameras doing things I'd probably be doing anyways. Metal and glass - that's all. And a whole wide world of douchebags whacking off on the other side! Ugh... I gotta go. Have fun with your little nudie site. My name's Mia. Welcome to Girlhouse. Come inside! Come on, boys. I'm so wet and ready for you. Oh, yeah. Yeah... Oh, oh... Oh, mm... Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Linda Atkins, please leave a message. Hey, Mom, it's me. Great news... Um, I got a part-time job working for one of my professors. It pays really well, so I'll be able to send you some money. Also, I decided to move off campus with some friends. It's way cheaper and way more spacious than the dorms. Oh, yeah, and, wait, here's the best part: I got this scholarship that begins next semester, so you won't have to pay my tuition from now on. I miss you, Mom. Talk soon. Bye. Kylie Atkins! What changed your mind? Got my eye on a new pair of shoes. My detractors say I'm just some smut pedlar, preying on the weaknesses of young women and men. I say screw them. The fact is, I'm one of the fastest-rising entrepreneurs in America. I'm no pimp. I'm the Hugh Hefner for the 21st century. Um, about the pay. Can I really expect to make - as much as you said? - Minimum. Anything above base salary is up to you. We track every eyeball and every girl every second of the day. You bring dollars, you get rewarded. Sky's the limit. Now... How do I make sure one of these guys doesn't end up stalking me? Today, Girlhouse is the most secure, technologically advanced site of its kind. My team of top engineers work around the clock from an untraceable location to ensure that Girlhouse can never be tracked or hacked. Team, say hi to Kylie. : Hi to Kylie. Bye, team. With this little baby, I can monitor and control every aspect of the site 24/7. Cameras, microphones, computers - I can block it all with the push of a button. Girlhouse is pretty much the Fort Knox of websites. Um... How much of that is required? Uh, nothing's ever required. Everything and everyone you do is up to you. Look, when I approached you in the quad last spring, it was because I could see you were someone special. I knew you had what it takes to be a hit. Here we are. Home sweet home. After you. - Steve. - Gary. This is Kylie, our newest resident. - Pleasure. - Hi. Steve and Big Mike oversea security. Along with the perimeter wall out back, they're our low-tech last line of defence. How often do you have to turn people away? Uh, a few times a year some college chump follows one of the girls home. No big deal. Yeah. Especially when you're an ex-NC State linebacker. : Okay, so now we're at this nice state... Shit, Gary! You didn't say you were coming by! And that's Kat. She's... Well, she's Kat. Uh, we have over 50 cameras around the house. I encourage you to utilize as many as you can. - So, like, hundreds of guys are watching us right now? - Thousands, at any given moment. Why do they want to watch all the boring stuff like this? Well, it gives members the sensation of actually getting to know you. It's what makes us different from other sites. - There's our Kat. - These guys will fall in love with you, 'cause they're not getting just the sex, they're getting a full experience. It's kinda like they live with us. Except each girl's full identity is always kept secret. Members can never figure out where or who you are in real life, and if some random viewer does recognize you, we block or delete any attempt to broadcast it. Should we take the tour? That's Devon, our main attraction. Devon. This is Kylie, our new roommate. A little on the wholesome side, eh, Gare? Hope she doesn't devalue the product. She thinks you're competition. Take it as a compliment. Come on. Okay... That's Janet. She's doing a chat right now, probably with a bunch of millionaire execs. She's big with the Fortune 500 crowd. That's 'cause I'm all business, bitches! This is Kylie, the new girl. Hey, girl. Okay, boys, you wanna see my spreadsheet? - Okay... - Get that. Yeah! This is Heather's room. She's the wild one. Also the loudest in the sack. When she's knocking boots you're gonna hear about it. Literally, the whole house shakes. Hey! Gare, thought I heard you out there. - Hey, Heather, this is Kylie. - Hey, hun. Pleasure. Gare, you still owe me for that 3-way last week, remember? Oh, God, I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll get on that, okay? - Okay. - All right. Good luck, and live sexy. Take care. Okay, come on. Here it is. New girl always gets the third floor. It's perfect. - Here you are. - Hey! I missed you. - Kylie, this is Mia, my girlfriend. - Hey. - Hey. - I know, I know what you're probably thinking, "How do they justify living here, doing this for all those sleazy guys out there," but we don't look at it like that. The members may not necessarily be our fantasy, but we definitely are theirs. And they're not all creepy losers. You'll see. Come on. Bye! And you all go to Selby College? - Are you kidding? - I dropped out when I found out how much money I could make here. It's ridiculous. Mm-hmm. No college for this girl. Gary found me in Vegas. - Stripping, or... - No. Making $5 foot-longs at Subway. Now she puts about 5 foot-longs in her subway - each week. - Yeah, for a lot more than $5. Yeah! Yeah, I go to Selby, but that's not where I met Gary. I was in a bikini contest in South Beach, he was judging. I offered to blow him for first place. - ...And? - I didn't realize there was a second judge, and I came in second. - Okay, what about you? - What's your story? - I'm from Topeka. - Mm-hmm. - Siblings? - I'm an only child. - What do your parents do? - My mom is a housewife. Hmm, sweet. What about your dad? He, um... He passed away. Oh, I'm so sorry. - Recently, or... - Like, 3 months ago. But anyway, I'm really happy to know about the off-camera room. I might need to use the bathroom there - until I get more comfortable. - Yeah. Some guys pay serious coin for that. - Ew! - Shut, up, Devon, - you fucking love it. - Okay, ladies, ladies, - ladies, I think it's time... - Oh... - Time... - Time for what? - To get naked! Okay, boys. Here I am. Okay, remember - just you and your computer. No tricks, but... m aybe a few treats. I don't know, Gare. It's a little junior high to me. Just give her a minute. Oh, really? Are you here for these? Here we go, gang. Damn, girl! Nice rack. Yes! I knew this girl would kill. Jimmy, time for dinner. In a minute Mom, I'm doing homework. Dude, clean up your shit. Dude, dude, shut up. You gotta get in here and see this girl, - right now. Right now! - All right, you can clean up later, then. - Fuckin' way... - I know, right? Hot as balls. No, dude; I know that girl. I'm serious, that's Kylie Atkins. I went to school with her. You know this creature? Not possible. - Okay... - Dude, what are you doing? - Why, are you in love with her? - What? No! Oh, my God. How long? - Kindergarten. - Does she know?... Naw, that makes sense. You're a total dork, and she's... ...that. You are a natural! - I loved it. How did it feel? - You know, just me and my computer. Oh! It's Loverboy. He's always on here. He's a total sweetie. You should say hi. Sorry, Loverboy, you just missed me. Can you come back tomorrow? We'll chat one-on-one. You bet. That works, I'll look for you. By the way, great handle. Anyone with "love" in their name is okay by me. Anyone with "love" in their name is okay by me. Aw, yeah... Oh... Wow. You are really not taking this well. - Yo... - Think about it this way, man. From now on, you literally get to jerk off - to your dream girl. - She goes to Selby College, - actually. - Like, Selby in Milton? Mm-hmm. Dude, that's like, 70 miles from here. You gotta go get her. I'm serious; Dude, she's not only right around the corner, she's gettable. "Gettable"? Why, 'cause she's doing porn? Exactly! Dude, it's got self-esteem issues - written all over it. - No, you don't understand. There must be an explanation. Kylie was always the hottest girl in Topeka, but she was never... a slut. How would you know that? You said it yourself, you were too much of a pussy to ever talk to her, so why don't you drop some fertilizer down on those floors, and grow your little apple seeds into Granny Smiths and go get her! Mm-hmm, yes. Gonna do that. Fucking gorgeous. Drink up, buttercup! We need to switch shots for clothes. - Strip war? Hell yeah! - Yeah, yeah. "Go-suck- cock-for-a-liv-ing..." Fuck! Lady luck over here! What, did you fuck a leprechaun - last night? - Shirt's off, sourpuss. Perfect... Ahh! You scared the crap out of me! What are you doing here? You know you're not supposed - to be here. - Gary's gonna be pissed. Whatever. I had nowhere else to go. I'm broke and homeless, okay? Anyways, I'm clean now, so I can come back. - I highly doubt you're clean. - And Gary's already replaced you. What? You serious? That's my bed! - She's pretty. - ...And nice. ...And not a heroin addict. Gary, if you're watching, I swear I'll be good from now on. Besides, you need some latin panocha up in here, give this house some flavour. Look, I'm off the crank, I promise, just give me one more chance. You sure you wanna give up on this? He says you can stay on the couch... for now. Thank you so much, papi, I... I won't let you down, I swear. Okay, who's next? I need you guys cheering for me! Ready, girls? Pay attention! Whose turn is it? Who's next? Woo! Is that coconut? I've missed you. : Gotcha now... You got clean for me? I knew it was coconut. Hey. Linda Lovelace, in the flesh. Saw your show last night. Definitely got me hard. The house looks nice though - score. When are you going to invite me over for tea? No can do. The location is top secret. Really? What about all the guys that come over - to pork your brains out? - They are blindfolded - on the drive over. - You're kidding. - No. - Kinky. - Tell her yet? - I'm really not too worried about her logging on and finding out, so... nope. Kylie... Wow! Hey. - Uh, hi... - Yeah. Ben Stanley. What are you doing here, do you go to Selby? No, I don't, actually, I go to Old North Tech in Charlotte. - But I have a chemistry lab here, twice a week. - Oh. So, wow! It's so good to see you. Were you in Topeka this summer? ...Yeah. - 'Cause I... I didn't see you. - I didn't... get out much. My... dad died. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Wow... Well, I mean, I didn't know your dad, but if he contributed to making you, he must have been pretty awesome. You look different... from high school. Late growth spurt, that's what that is. - Well, it's good to... - Hey, do you wanna... Sorry, do you wanna maybe go for coffee some time? - Or like, a snack? - "Snack"? Yeah... I don't know why I said snack. Um... Yeah, that'd be great. Cool, when... should we do that? - Gimme a call. - Okay. - Wait, is that the time? - Yeah. - I gotta go. - Where? I'll walk you. No, um... No, it's okay. I... Across campus. It's far away. Call me! Hey, Loverboy, sorry I'm late. Aww, not this girl. Let's go private. So... Do you want me to get undressed? Oh... Just talk. Okay, sure. I can do that. What do you wanna talk about? : Come on, lover boy! : Um.. The girls say you're something of a regular. I like that. Means you're loyal. What do you do for work? Oh, like programming? How do you like that? Oh, that's... nice. Aww... Thanks, Loverboy. You too. What do you mean? True, but sometimes you can just tell. Well, I'm sure you're very handsome. Are you sure you don't want me to get undressed? It's okay, it's what I'm here for. Sorry, Loverboy, can we pick this up another time? Wait, how did you do that? Gary said this place was impossible to hack... Yes, Loverboy, I think you're beautiful. Bye. It's weird, we've known each other since... Since kindergarten... I think. Yeah. And this is the first time we've actually really hung out. That is weird. Who else do you keep in touch with from home? Oh, just my close friends. You know, my homies. Um... What about you? No one, really. It's weird, you know, sometimes it feels like you have so many friends one minute, and then you leave home and you're basically all alone. It's hard to picture you as not popular. - I mean, I have friends... - And now you have me. I do, do I? Mm-hmm. - Uh, well, this is me, so... - Very nice. Hey, uh, you know there's this matinee on Saturday of Rear Window, it's playing at that old theatre by the river... Do you have a chemistry lab on Saturday, too? Oh... Yeah, no, no, no. Um... But Hitchcock is definitely worth the 70-mile drive. Yeah, I'll see you Saturday. See you Saturday. Good night. It's Kylie. I need a pick-up. Thanks. How's that exam prep going? You know, I think you might be the only straight person I know to turn it off when the nudity starts. Which does beg the interesting question of, you are straight, - aren't you? - Dude... I'm gonna tell her. - ...That I know. - About Girlhouse? - Bad idea, dude. - Okay, um... Why? If she knows, then she'll think that you think she's easy. Any girl on a site like this must be a whore. But I don't think that. It's not gonna matter, dude. You wanna keep this thing going, do not tell her. Excuse me. Hi. Wow, looks intimidating in there. You must be pretty smart if you know how to work all those wires and buttons. I've always been attracted to smart men. Men with brains. But do you wanna know what's not smart? What's not smart is coming to a job site and then sexually harassing one of the employees. I saw what you were doing. Tongue hanging out, like some thirsty dog. Get a good peek? Hmm? One word to your boss, I could have you fired like this. Next time, think twice before preying on innocent women. Got it? I said, you got it, you sick perv? OH MY GOD! Hmm. Not so smart after all. Poor Jimmy Stewart, with those two broken legs! But he got the girl, so... It is a pretty steep price for love. No price is too steep for love, Kylie. That was good, right, a good Jimmy? What are the odds that we bump into each other like that the other day? It's crazy! Well, maybe it wasn't so random. What do you mean? I um... I know. About Girlhouse. Oh, I see. You saw something you liked and you wanted to sample the merchandise. No, it's not like that at all. I don't understand... - You don't understand. - Then help me. - I'm going to go. - Kylie... I only brought it up 'cause I don't want it to be an issue moving forward. Porn is not what it used to be, okay? It's totally different now. It's mainstream and accepted. I mean, think about Sasha Grey or Jenna Jameson. - There's no stigma. Nobody cares. - Yeah, but... - ...shouldn't they? - I don't know. What about these other guys that are coming to the house? Fair. It's not required. Okay, but I assume it's a big part of the job sooner or later. Not necessarily. Girlhouse is different. It's not like that. The guys that log in, it's not just for that. They feel like they're getting to know us. They develop feelings, they fall in love, even. Come on, Kylie. They just want to fuck you. That's all. Well, I am not that type of girl. Yeah, that's what I keep telling myself. You know what, you have no right to judge me, okay? You have no idea what I'm going through right now. I'm doing this so I don't have to quit school. My dad's gone and my mom needs all the help she can get. And you know what, the guys? That's the toughest part about this. Okay? I'm hoping I can just get in there, make as much money as I can, and then get out before that becomes an issue. I've thought this through completely. I really don't see how anything bad could happen. I'm sorry. So... Is this, you know, going to be a problem moving forward? Not until you ask me to stay the night. I am extremely camera-shy. No idea, Loverboy. I'm kinda busy here. Loverboy, I'm trying to do a show. Jesus! I said I don't know where she is. You really are a pathetic freak. - You were with him last night? - Yeah, I had sex with him the other night and then I told you that he was small. Well, I mean, he's okay... Well, you told me that he was small... - Who is that? - Oh, my God, look who it is! - It's Loverboy... Yeah. - Oh, Loverboy! Hey, Loverboy, I'm just curious. How did you come up with that handle, "Loverboy"? You must be quite the ladies' man. Could have gone with "Loserboy". Definitely. Janet! Janet! Come say hi to Loverboy. Aww, poor Loverboy! Don't be mean. - Enough of him. - I mean, anyways. What... Enjoy the show. Come on, have dinner with me tonight. We can drive back to Charlotte. We can go to this awesome barbeque place, you can meet my roommates... How would I get back? You could spend the night. I told you I have study group. But I'll take a rain check. Because meeting your roommate is totally worth the 70-mile drive. Funny. Is this some kind of joke? Hey, buddy! Private property, you can't be here. Turn around now, before I make you. All right, well, you asked for it. Ahh! Fuck, that... Oof! Ooh, baby... Mm... Oh, baby... Can I help you? Let me guess. You're here for Devon? No, wait... Heather. She likes that kinky shit. Well, run along. Her room's upstairs. Homie, you're really starting to piss me off, man. - Hi. - Hey. All right, boys, ready to have your minds blown? Only 3 of you? ...Or only 3 of you with your hands free to type? Yeah, screw this. I'm going one-on-one. Sorry, fellas. Tugboat and I are going private. I'm going to go. Got a lot to do tonight. Reading War and Peace or showing your lady parts to all of humanity? Real cute. What the... Okay. What the fuck? What are you talking about? Maybe jerking off really does ruin your vision. Aw, shit! What's your problem, Tugboat? Okay, is this a prank? Are you trying to freak me out? Not cool. Okay, you know what? If that's how you're going to be, this session is over. Fuck you. - HELP ME! NO! AHH! - Shut up! Jesus! Dude, I need you to come here, right now. Somebody help... What is this, a joke? - Ahh, my face... - What's that they say about beauty? Something about skin deep? Is this real? Is this really happening right now, or is it, like, some gimmick to drive up traffic? I don't know! They did some weird shit before, but nothing like this! Nobody knows. Call 911, now, right now! Do it! I gotta warn Kylie. Shit! - What the fuck? - 911, what's your emergency? Hi, um, I don't really know how to explain... So I'm on this website called Girlhouse. - "Girlhouse"? - It's a pornographic website. Sir, I'm not following, this line is for emergencies only. Look, I realize that, but I'm pretty sure I'm watching a girl being murdered online. - Where is she? - I don't know! Um... - Is she in Charlotte? - I have no fucking clue! I'm pretty sure she's somewhere in the state. Well, if you don't know where she is, how am I supposed to help her? Sir? Sir? That's it. That's it. Why? - He's putting on a show. - I can't get a hold of Kylie. - Did you call the cops? - They can't do anything. - What do you mean... - We don't know where the house is. It could be fucking anywhere, man. Did Kylie ever tell you? Dude... No, no, NO! DON'T, DON'T, DON'T! - Ugh... - This is insane. Dude, there has to be - some way to find them. - From a live video broadcast? What about the website, okay? It has to be registered, or... Girlhouse prides itself on its impenetrability, man. Trust me. - I've snooped around. - Well... Okay, we know they're in Carolina, right? Kylie goes to Selby in Milton, - so it can't be far from there. - That really narrows it down. Fucking call the cops again, man! Do something! See what they have on the website, all right? Business records, licences, tax receipts, anything. And then I need you to hop onto that computer and work your magic. You're a friggin' CompSci major, dig into your bag of wizardry and then hack the fuck into that site. - Well what are you going to do? - I'm gonna drive to Milton. - Hopefully you'll have an address for me by the time I get there. - That'll take - an hour and a half! - I'll be there in 45 minutes. Don't let me down, okay? Kylie's life may depend on this. No pressure, right? I'm so... Please... MOM... Oof.. - Damn! - Close one. : Are you married? Happily? : Who is happily married nowadays? Stop it, I'm trying to watch. Come on, you buy this crap? It's called love, dumbass. Believe it or not, some people still want that. Please, there are far too many distractions nowadays. Porn sites, the dating sites, cheating sites... You really think if this guy had Girlhouse he'd have acted this way? He'd be too busy watching you. Okay, 20 minutes, then we can fuck. Stop it. Stop it, I wanna watch the movie. Sorry, 20 minutes is too long. Yeah... Yes, baby! Oh, again! Yes! Huh! Oh, yeah! Bro, are you serious? You wanna watch, log on like everyone else. Jesus! Take it easy, guys. Fuck! That's enough. No, no, no! Don't go in there, don't go in there, turn around! AHH! NO! AHH! Okay, I think that's enough for me. I'm gonna rinse off and head upstairs before I pass out. You wanna come? In a minute. Okay, suit yourself. Oh fuck! Hello? - Yo, anything? - Not yet. - Come on! - I'm trying! Yeah, well try harder! Help! Anyone? I'm stuck! Help! Anyone? Kat! Anyone? I'm stuck! Help! KAT! Ah... Ah... Come on, come on, come on... - Yo, anything? - Dude, she knows. Shit. Okay, uh, I'm almost at Selby; You got anything for me yet? - Negative. - Then try something else, man, COME ON! Okay... She's alive. Hi, do you know Kylie Atkins? Do you know Kylie Atkins? No... Do you know Kylie Atkins? I know Kylie Atkins. - Jesus Christ! - She never said where this place is? No, they keep it secret for security reasons. - Ah. Genius. - Did you call the police? - Of course. - The Milton police? - Mm! Mm... - Shh. - Argh! - Mm! Shit! There he is. Help me move this. Ahh! Stop! Stop! Oh... I thought you... were nice. - Loverboy? - Ahh... No... - Stop! - HEY! - Okay, come on! - No, wait! Not without Devon. Kylie, we have to get out of here. - You go. Call the cops. - Okay. Oh, my God! Big Mike! Thank God you're here! There's somebody inside that's killing everybody! - What? - We have to get out of here. Calm down. What guy? Where is he? Huh? No, no, no, no. No, no, please, please, don't! Please don't kill me! Please! Please, please... AHH! - We found it. - You did? - They found it. Where? - I'm not at liberty to say, but it's a property registered to Gary Preston, owner and operator of Girlhouse. No, no, you need to tell me. My girlfriend is in there. We have units on the way, they should be there any minute. No, come on, okay! You've gotta tell me! Sir, you can come to the police station and wait for her here. - Devon, Devon. - It's me, Kylie. Oh, God... Oh, God. Okay. - Hold on... - Please, please... - Oh, God. Sweetie, sweetie, - we gotta get you out of here. - No... Please kill me. What? No. No, no, no. I can't live looking like this. We gotta go. We gotta go right now. Please. He's coming. - Devon! - Save yourself! Okay, stay here, okay? I'll be right back with help. Stay here. Oh, Jesus! Where the hell are the cops? - Where are they? - They're there. Uh, no, they're not, I'm looking at the house right now. Go, go, go! All clear! - How about you? - We're going to need an M.E. - Yeah? - I got it. - You're kidding! Where? - I just texted you the address, man. - How'd you do it? - I wasn't able to hack into Girlhouse at all, so I tried their ISP instead. I got in to the Centuricast grid for Davidson County and found this secluded mansion out in the sticks with a huge bandwidth trail going there. That's genius, man! Okay, call the Milton Police and tell them, because unlike me, they don't have Einstein on their team. Just hurry, dude. She's the only one left. AHH! What the hell's she doing? Urgh! Urgh! Urgh! I am never going to another porn site again. Not... nice... ...And I am definitely going to need therapy. - No cameras... No... - What did you say? - Please no cameras.
