This being the last will and testament of Colonel George Herbert Merryweather of London. He... he... lost it all? Including the house? No! No, Papa can't have been in London. Why, he wrote to me and said that he was coming home, he wouldn't arrive and not... Aah, well... Your father did leave you this book... as your inheritance. "The Ancient Chronicles of Moonacre Valley" I know it's hard... but you know I... I'm sure that your father did... did love you. He just... um, and... and you know, everybody does have to go out on their own at some point in their... lives. Miss Heliotrop, I'm fine! Really! Yes... "Once upon a perfect time... many hundreds of years ago... when the old magic called Moonacre Valley... there was a young woman whose skin glint as pale as the star... and whose heart was as pure as a meteorite's... such was her bravery and goodness... she was beloved by nature... as if she was their daughter. One fateful night... the moon blessed her with an extraordinary gift... with a tinge of the magic of the valley... forever! The moon power! From that day forward... she was known... as the Moon Princess! Two ancient families lived in harmony at the edge of the valley... sharing nature's bounty. Daughter to the De Noir clan... the Moon Princess was deeply in love and was to be married to Sir Wolf Merryweather. Her father, Sir William De Noir, blessed the union by presenting the couple with a rare black lion. For my daughter's bridegroom! Thank you, father! In turn, Sir Wolf gave his bride a unicorn. Littered from the wild white horses of the sea. Only an animal of such beauty and purity could be the companion of the Moon Princess. Her heart overflowed with happiness! The Moon Princess revealed the magical powers to both families. This was found deep in the heart of the ocean. This pearl was given to us by mother nature herself! Promising untold riches to us all. Look! They have a unique power! They can reveal the truth in man's heart! Legend told of their unique powers, so strong the pearls will grant every wish. Both good and evil! Good bye... Good bye... You be Miss Maria Merryweather? My man! Quick! Madame... Get on with you! Good bye... yes, yes, yes... Miss Heliotrop? Maria... When your dear mother died, I promised her faithfully that I'll take care of you. So I'm not going to abandon you now! If you're going to live with your uncle, or in the middle of the country-side, then I shall be there with you. Where are my charcoal tablets? These are doing nothing for my indigestion. How can I possibly go live in the country? It's like a camp-site! Maria, there's only one thing that can save us now. Clever girl, French, needle point. What's happening? Have we arrived? Is he deaf or something? The man is obviously a half wit. Who are they? What do they want? Don't worry my dear, Sir Benjamin will protect us, I'm sure! Miss... Welcome to Moonacre! Unfortunate circumstances. There we are, nothing to be done. I'm pleased to meet you, Uncle. Miss Heliotrop. Oh, Sir Benjamin. Oh, what a journey we had!!! Not one hour from this very door we were accosted by a bunch of ruffians. Madame, please! - It... Tell me your fascinating story some other time if I may. His name is Wolf. There are those who find him alarming. He can kill in an instant. But you're a Merryweather. He very probably won't harm you. Miss Heliotrop, your room is over there to the right. Oh, thank you, Sir Benjamin. Well, come along Maria. I'm sure that your room... will be next to mine. No, Maria's room is up in the tower. But, I'm kind... You have to inspect the room first before you turn your nose up at whatever it is. Good night, Uncle! Charmed, I'm sure. What on earth is this? Oh, no! No, I think not. Young lady. We're taking breakfast in here. Where did you get this from? Oh um, papa left it to me. Well, he had no right... This belong here. But, that's mine!! Miss Heliotrop! Help! Help, tell him he can't take my father's book from me! Maria! Good question! Why don't you just speak... That he can't just go and... Maria! Don't worry. I'm sure that he's just keeping it safe somewhere for you. Sit down. Have your porridge. Miss. There be your breakfast, Miss. Maria, you really must try this delicious omelet. Hum,um, a dish best enjoyed in silence, I'm told. Uncle, when can you return my father's book to me? Now, you certainly have a very, very good cook, Sir Benjamin. Have you... have you had her long? Madame, no woman has stepped in this house for years! And believe me, the silence has been blissful. Now, I must say, this country food is doing wonders for my trapped wind! Madame, please! Can't a man enjoy a meal in his own home in silence? Well, do tell us Uncle... Why did you invite such irritating and noisy females into your nice quiet house? I'd love to know. My useless brother died in debt and it fell on me to take you in. The man was a... cowardly good for nothing. Sir Benjamin!! How dare you say that?! My father was a Colonel! Yes. And he died in debt owing money to half the regiment. He fought for his country! And got himself killed in a backstreet gambling den. Borrowed money once too many times from the wrong sort of money lenders. He wouldn't take money from me, would he? Oh no. Damn, all his pride. You're a Merryweather, Maria... And this is where you belong. Here, at Moonacre. There we are. Nothing else to be done. Library is private and my study prohibited. And in here... The East wing, closed... the West wing, out of bounds. There we are. - And here... - Uncle, about that attack yesterday. Can't something be done? Yes... keep your little nose out. I beg your pardon? Just keep out of the forest. But why? Who are they? There's a band of ruffians in the woods. The De Noir clan. You mean like the "De Noir" from the story book? No, no, no... these are real enough. Poachers, bandits, plunderers, robbers. Ladies. This should suit your needs. And this will be your classroom. (Speaking French) Digweed... Bring me my whip. You weren't expecting me to... She can ride, can she? Oh, Sir Benjamin, it's a matter of fact that a lady should never be allowed to sit on a horse! They're unstable and they're vicious creatures. I think, Sir Benjamin, it might be an appropriate moment for me to retire. Take care! Come, Maria. Every Merryweather rides. It's in the blood. This is Peririco... she's a little feisty but she's a loyal stead. Just hold out your hand. I give you my word, it'll stay attached to you, Miss. You see, Miss? She knows. - You're getting on well with Peririco... - Yes, Uncle. We should be heading back. It's getting late. Uncle, I'm really enjoying this. Could I stay out a little longer? As long as you promise to stay within the Moonacre boundary. Remember... I can only vouch for your safety if you stay out of the forest. I will be home before long, and Peririco will take good care of me. Very well. Goodbye Uncle! What's so special about the forest anyway? You stay here. Oh, little baby. Who did this to you? One catch two captives. What do you want? Let's go. Catch an animal that comes to get you coming to help! I know who you are! You're bandits and plunderers! You! You're coming with us now! My father's just dying to make your acquaintance. It's the demon dog! Thank you, you obedient doggy! Come on, little one... Let me take you home. Robin, it's your father! What did I do to deserve such a prize filth for a son? I hope Peririco gave you an educational tour of the estate. I have a wounded hare. That, young lady, is a rare Moonacre rabbit. By far the most beautiful, brave and serene creature. And as you've brought her in from the wild, she's now your responsibility. And with your knowledge of animals, I very much doubt it will live to see the morning. Keep out of the forest child! Maria? Goodness gracious! Look at your... dress! Maria, there's something alive on your body! Miss Heliotrop, please calm down! This is a Moonacre rabbit... A beautiful, brave and serene creature. I intend to look after it. And I'm going to call her Serena. Uncle? I really think you and I have some matters to discuss. There are some very strange things going on in this house. First off, who always keeps my dress and leaves the biscuits in my room? The stars on my ceiling move. There's a mysterious white horse outside. This place is falling apart, things appear to move, and the piano plays music on its own! I mean, I have never even seen the kitchen. So where on earth does all this food come from? Do you ever stop asking questions? Uncle, I... Sit down, my dear. Wolf? Where are we going? Wolf? Wolf? Wolf?! Marmaduke Scarlet. Chef of all chefs, at your service, Little Princess. How do you do that? Get me some sherbet, will you? Chop, chop... I'm not actually really sure where your sherbet is... Never you mind...I'll get it... Are you the one who leaves the milk and biscuits for me? These past few days, it all comes back to me. Scarlet please, will you stop yourself for just one moment? Surely somebody in this household must be able to answer my questions. Dear Princess, a little bit of magic... has come back to the valley. You obviously haven't finished reading the book. The book? But my uncle took it away from me. In the library, you'll find a slim volume, Secret Doors and Private Lockers... Perhaps a piece of... stargazer pie for your study. The Moon Princess truly believed in the goodness of all. But the men soon fell to the greed that was in their heart. Each desperate to claim the power of the pearls for himself. We are the chosen ones! These pearls stay with the De Noir clan forever! Father? Come! Be with me. Let Moonacre be your home and be your family. Speak true! With the power of these pearls, I can claim the valley for myself. No. Together, I mean together we could rule the valley. These pearls belongs to no man, they belong to nature! Give it to me!! No! Give them to me!!! No no no!!! I beg of you... please!!! You cannot let your heart be ruled by greed! Betrayed by those she loved the most, the Moon Princess unleashed the power bestowed upon her, and cast a terrifying curse over them all. Hear me!!!! You've gone against the nature, and you shall suffer for it! Nature will wreak her revenge and put a curse upon this valley. One day, a pure heart will walk among you. If she can't lift the curse, when the 5000th moon rises from the sea, this valley shall be plunged into eternal darkness!!!! The moon pearls vanished that day, and where to find them remained a secret. Marmaduke! The house... the valley... it's all... - Cursed! Oh yes! Take a look around you. Everything's falling apart. Ever since that terrible day, the two families have been totally consumed with pride... and blind hatred. And the only person who can break this curse is a true Moon Princess! The Moon Princess? But... she lived hundreds of years ago. The legend tells... of a little white horse, a mystical companion to protect her. A magical creature... invisible so they say... to anyone... except a true Moon Princess. You mean... I'm suppose to be this... I'm supposed to undo this curse? Everyone knows the legend. Peace will never be restored... until the pearls are return to the sea and the families reunited! This is all madness! Time is slipping away. the 5,000th moon... to set it right. Stop! Stop... I don't want to hear another word! You are all insane!! Three hundred and eighty-four years... times thirteen for the moon's per annum. Plus... seven moons for this year. That's... That makes... four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine. Oh Serena, the very next moon's arrival will be the 5,000th moon. Everyone knows the legend... These pearls belongs to no man... They belong to nature! You're a Merryweather... You're the chosen one! Keep out of the forest child! I've to get out of this remote place, Serena! I don't want anything more to do with this! Miss Heliotrope will take good care of you. Maria.... Maria... Who are you? You look... just like the lady in the painting. Come along. Oh, do come in!! You naughty hedgehog! In my favorite chair again! You cheeky monkey! Be nice and still, don't make any sudden movement. Then she won't be so scared! I will try! Oh! I was talking to the snake. I rescued as many injured creatures as I can. And did you do the embroidery and brought all those strange dresses in my room? Yes. My name is Loveday. Our time is nearly spent right here... the moon shall not be our forever. You saw something, didn't you? Didn't you? Tell me what you saw. I have to leave! No no no no... Stay with me! I've frightened you, haven't I? You see, I'm not used to visitors. And I do so much just want to be your friend. It's no use you know... your father... he tried to run away too. But there is nowhere to hide. He sent you here because he loved you. Because Moonacre is where you belong. You and I are the same. Except... Except? Where I failed, you might succeed. What about my uncle? Sir Benjamin... can't he help? Never, ever mention that man to me again, do you understand? Your past is behind you. Your future awaits you if you want it. You decide. I want to help. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do to begin. Find the pearls! Nobody knows where they are. Each family blames the other for taking them. They are both to blame. The De Noir took the casket then we must have the key. The key! Now for the casket. You have to take me there. - Where? - To De Noir. You've to take me to where they live. There it is! Loveday... are you alright? I'm sorry! I can never go back there! Loveday! Loveday! Father, I could pad and place a scythe and nail it under their roof. Don't go near Moonacre... that house is damned! No... the word is... she is about to meet her downfall. How kind of you to join us, Moon Princess. Oh... Oh, and what is this? She has brought us the lost key, gentlemen! Wasn't it terrible of the De Noir to have the moon pearls hidden up here all the time... haven't we? Well, it's true isn't it? Your ancestors stole them! My ancestors?! Well, perhaps Princess... I should introduce you... Maria Merryweather... the last Moon Princess. Sir William. The very first De Noir. The pearls casket! And you so very kindly brought us the key. You've hidden them!! They were never there, girl! Your filthy Merryweather family took them! Before he... picked up the box! They stole the pearls. But soon... the final moon will rise... and the thieving Merryweathers will be punished! I'm glad that we have you here. There's nothing anyone can do to stop it! At last the entire valley will be ours! And the De Noir will finally feast upon revenge!! Leave me alone, you ogre! You know, for someone in your predicament, I have to admire your spirit! Witch! Hey! Lock her in! Welcome to your new house!! Hope you make friends with the roaches! Guard, watch her... she's slippery. Where is that girl? Unbelievable! Absolutely irresponsible! Oh, this dress! Come back here, you witch!!! The girl has escaped! Princess! What're you going to do now? She won't find her way out of the forest. - She can't have come this far... - Let's try north! Go Robin, find her! I want her killed! I want her to stop the curse. Their death is our victory! Stupid girl... should have stayed where you were. Robin! This way! Oh... Wolf!! Quickly! Can you find the way home? That demon dog can't protect you forever! Now that be Miss Maria home, sir. Uncle Benjamin... Miss Heliotrop! I'm really sorry! Where are your... where are... Miss Heliotrop! Miss Heliotrop! I'm perfectly alright... yes. But what happened to your clothes, my dear one? How dare you come home in this manner and at this hour? I'm sorry but you don't know what happened, I was... I was... in the forest and... In the forest? Didn't I expressively forbid you to go to the forest? Yes. But... listen, I've so much to tell you! Go upstairs this instance and tidy yourself up! But... Just do as you're told! You're not my father! Maria! Maria, open this door! Listen... It maybe possible... that I was... a little rough earlier. The point is you were gone for such a long time. I mean you didn't even tell us! I... We! Miss Heliotrop was beside herself with worry. Maria... I know that... given that women and I normally don't see eye to eye... It wouldn't be untrue to say... I'm glad that you're back. Who put this back on the wall?! Digweed? Digweed!! Come and take this away! Seems that there won't be any stars left tonight, Serena. The Moon is getting closer and closer. What're we going to do? How could you leave me like that?! In the forest. This belongs to the first ever Moon Princess. Forgive me? Fits you like a glove! Oh Loveday, this is all hopeless. What? I'm as far away from actually finding the pearls as ever. Perhaps it's here somewhere... hidden. Come on, come with me. Where? Downstairs? Oh no no, I'm not going downstairs. Isn't it bad luck for the groom to see the dress? I wanted you to see me just as I am before the wedding. And what does that mean? Benjamin. I have to tell you something. Something I should've told you a long, long time ago. My darling... what ever is it?... Hmm? I am not who you think I am. I'm a De Noir. A De Noir? I was brought up to despise the Merryweathers, but later then I met you and that changed everything. You tricked me! No! You pretended to love me! No! And all these times you were plotting behind my back, trying to find those ridiculous pearls. It was your father that sent you, wasn't it? No. By marrying you, I lost his love forever. But Benjamin, don't you see? Our love could bring our families back together! Can put an end to this dreadful curse! Curse. No, don't give me that nonsense!! And you filled this house with your De Noir flowers!! No no please... you don't understand. Doesn't love change everything? No... my dear... but hate does. So... you missed your chance to bring the families together. He broke my heart. I think he broke his heart too. But he let me be lost forever. It must have been quite a shock for him. I mean, maybe if you've waited for him to calm down. Perhaps apologize? Oh, me apologize?! You don't understand, do you? I'm starting to understand one thing. The real curse of this valley... is pride! Digweed, stop! But that'll be the master wishes! I'll be back. Exactly! Miss Maria, tell me more about this curse! There she is. Each time when a new Moon Princess arrives, so does this picture. But look at it... look at it! Digweed... you can move now... Oh... thank goodness! Can't you see?! There, look! She's showing us! She took the pearls! Maria... are you telling us... that the Moon Princess herself took the Moon pearls?! Yes! Yes, and she's showing me where she hid them! But where? Where did she put them? They're in the trees somewhere... out in the forest. Well, that's a help. No, I saw that it was nearby. I think I'll know it again if I saw it. Hmm, what? What? There's only one person who has walked the woods his whole life. Someone who has it in his blood. Robin?! Impossible! He's an arrogant so and so! I never ever want to see him again! It's a point of honor. It's a matter of... Pride?! Good luck, little Princess!!! Bye! Wait... wait... No, Miss Heliotrop. No, you won't stop me! This is my home and I'm going to fight for it! No, no no... I know you've got to do this. I'm beginning to understand a little. I believe in you! - Bye... - Bye, Miss. But be careful! I will! That will be the post, sir... Loveday? Princess! Giving yourself up?! How good of you? The grand trapper... trapped! Let me down, you little witch!! Certainly... No no no, no don't you dare!! Oh... my foot. Thank you darling Serena. Off you go. Please! Wait! I'm really swelling, I can feel my head hurting! Oh no... it was like that before... - I would let you down if you do one thing for me. - What? Just promise you'll listen! Say "I promise"! Just say it! I promise! Alright, you beat me, let me down! Very well... What about him? You're a De Noir... he very probably will hurt you. I'm listening. Miss De Noir. Sir Benjamin. - Well... - Well... Benjamin? I'm here. - I believe apologies are in order. - Yes, they are. After all, one's behaviour have not been... as it might. That's right. I'm sorry. Yes, you should be. Beg your pardon? It shall be easy to forgive you, but... Forgive me?! What on earth are you talking about? Don't play games with me, Benjamin Merryweather! You asked me here! - It was you who asked to see me! - What! Maria. Maria. Where the devil is that girl? - Goodbye! - Robin, please! I promised I'll listen to you, and I have! Robin, you've to help me, you have to!! You are a Merryweather! - Right now I want to kill you. - Kill me and the whole valley dies with me. You and I can solve it and we only have until moon rise. Tonight! I'm still listening. She's back in the forest, and this time... she won't be leaving. They are armed men out there whose express aim it is to do her harm! I would have never agreed. I didn't know, you see. I must go to her. Oh, don't be a fool. I'll go. I know the forest. Wait! If you'll forgive me... I believe I know exactly where Maria will be. - You do? - How do you? I'm a superb chef, madame, it follows that I should possess a truly superb nose. In my youth, when I would roam those woods, I could track anything that moved. Plus she told me where she was going. What was that? False trails... What were you doing with one of my ribbons in your pocket? There are in the trees, that is very distinctive... It has massive roots twisting around a big dark color. I know where that is. Suppose for a moment, I do this to help you out. And suppose we actually manage to find the pearls... what then? Well... we... return the pearls to the sea and then we go. You know my father is coming after you? It's just a matter of finding them before he finds me. Miss De Noir, it's highly dangerous out there, this is no mission for a woman! Perhaps you should have told that to Maria. As a matter of fact I did. Frequently... Wait!! That will be another female for the party. Madame... you're not required on this expedition. Oh... that's better! - That'll be your wind... - Enough... Digweed... I've been taking care of Maria since she was a baby. And I intend to protect her now! I know which way to go! Come on! Marmaduke? Marmaduke, you blithering ex-hunter, what are you doing? Sorry, sir... It appears... my power's out here... are not what they are in the kitchen. Just show us where to go, would you?! I notice the house is falling down. Sad to see the place is in such a state of disrepair. If you're so fond of it, why did you run away from it? You took everything I held dearly and ripped it away from me. How could I stay? Run far, did you? No, not very far... But then you never came to look for me, did you? He spent months on horseback, scouted the entire county, searching for you. Marmaduke? - Are you leading this expedition or not? - Yes, sir. Yes. Hum... strawberry. This way! I think we might have a greater chance of finding her if we divide and spread the arc a little wider. It should be clear over the next hill... we're not far now. Wolf! Wolf!!! Wolf? Robin? Robin?! Wolf? Wolf... Wolf!! Let's go boy! Oh, this is pretty. Isn't it enough for one member of my family to betray me. Now I find the half-brother is a traitor too? I will take care of this Princess... myself... once and for all! Wolf? This is the place! Where are the pearls?! Listen! The moon will kill us all! Wolf, we have to find Maria! Wolf!! You! How could you betray me like that?! I will not let you take her, father. Put the knife down, boy. Father, please, you have to listen to what Maria has to say! Traitor! You're nothing to me now. Go! I know where to find you again! Back to where it all began. In here. Where did they go? Robin, look at this! Where are they? It's her. It must be. Where... where did you put them? The pearls! Open the door! Robin, let's go! It's so dark here. Moon pearls... we need your power now... show us the way! Suddenly seems... very quiet... That will be the absence of the ladies then, sir. Sir Benjamin!! We're lost! Maria! Robin, come on! Don't you see? She's showing us the way! De Noir! Merryweather! Good evening! Your niece has failed! If you harm, hurt her... in any way... Stop! - Uncle, No! No! - Father, we got them!! Look! Give me the pearls! Those damn pearls! They brought nothing but harm and grief! No, Uncle... it's not the pearls but the greed in our heart which brings us such misery. Father! Why do you have so much hatred in your heart? My daughter! Don't you want to be free of this darkness imprisoning you? It is he! It is he! Father! Benjamin! Look! The 5,000th moon. The curse is coming true! If you can sacrifice your pride, we can save our families. We can save the valley! You first. No, no... after you. I must do this myself! At the 5,000th moon, I, Maria Merryweather, Moon Princess of Moonacre... do remove the curse that has darkened this valley. Take back what is yours! No! No! Maria! Maria! Oh, my sweet child... you're alive! Uncle! Were you worried, Robin? No... I could've done that. You're the true Moon Princess! Oh... nasty! That will be a black lion male, sir... It's alright, Uncle. It's just a Wolf. Please forgive my stubborn pride! Loveday. - Stop right there! I'll finish her right now! - No, stop... you idiot! Maria! I'm here! I've come to save you! Is there... going to be a wedding? Oh, my... Mr. Digweed?! Well, there we are then... nothing to be done!
