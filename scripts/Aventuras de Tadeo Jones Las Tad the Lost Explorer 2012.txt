My father would not ignore something like that. What he was trying to tell me? Do not even think about it, Freddy. Certainly not the boss lady. I am a businessman, not a thief. And this is a good deal. Look at this, there's something behind it. Behind the wall? This is not a wall, i.e. a door. Believe me, I know I am talking about. That's it. Do not trust in solid rock. The scroll was only a key to open it. Help me Sara. Freddy, can you give us a hand? Just a moment, I'm take inventory. Do not trust the rock solid because sometimes the air is opaque stronger. This is our opaque wall. And this is true map to Paititi. This is what my father was trying to say. So these Odysseus ... Vain digging in the wrong place. Well done Professor. Hey buddy, how you got here? So I mean, if these Here there must be an output. It's over there? What happened? Not touch anything. Jeff, have to find a way out. Fast. And I have to decide the map.

Or are you exaggerating? Yes, you are overreacting. Come on. The serpent and the tree, that is. The snake is a river. Step two is calm. Do not panic. Panic leads to hysteria hysteria and leads to despair, and not brings no solution. Doctor, there's something this book useful? Step three, think of something original. I would love if we could leave. Wait, I think the Jeff found ... The output. Spirals symbolize the air. Air, wind. Come on Jeff, focus. Step one, stay calm. Then, step two. Ok, step two.

Earth, water, wind and fire. The mother of nature. Step one. Forget it. Jeff, please we're out of time. The watchdog found a way out? I certainly hope so. Way to go Jeff. Step Four: If you find the exit. Use it. Yes, yes, all symbols point to the jungle. Ulysses are digging in the desert. I know where Paititi, I knew. Come on Sarah, let's get out of here. Well done Jeff, you got a friend. You're the best. Hey, Belzoni. Still these integer? Also like her, right? Ok step five, if the flight is successful. Turn around and go home. What? Yes, already had enough. We can not go now. The statue of gold should not ... fall into the hands of Ulysses. If I could get a big bonus by work in these terrible circumstances ... Does that mean no?

He'll probably realize that be successful, it makes you happy ... without someone to share love. I hope so. And you? Are you happy? Of course, I live my dream, to be an archaeologist. How could I not be happy? I like your attitude. Most archaeologists are satisfied when they make great discoveries ... if they're lucky, it happens only once in a blue moon. But you're different. Are you real? Yes, I think so. We should get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow. Sara, I have to say something. You were saying ... What did you say? Forget it. Good evening. Hey, you, idiot. I think he meant to you. Better ires there before he will turn Chinese soup. Are you sure it's here? Of course I'm sure. And do not call me dumb gorilla. I tried to make it seem credible.

It can not be here right place. It must be very deep. One, two, three, four ... Eleven, twelve, thirteen ... Must be extremely deep. And now? An earthquake? I should have listened to my horoscope. And that voice in my head. "Do not get up out of bed today." We are in big trouble. Sara. I read the map, the city is real. We found the entrance. Ok, prepare everything. I want to get the hole within five minutes. Honey, thank God that these well. I was so worried. Ok, squad two fall and clear the area. Squad one, will get the girl and the teacher. Squadron Four, beware these idiots. Bind us. Do not worry about us. We stayed well. Hey, get me this front. I know how to walk. These crazy? Do not We can let live. They are not a threat, the Peru is a peddler. And the man with the hat is a mason. A mason? No matter what they are, if they flee, they will ruin the whole plan. I'm on my way sweet. What? Well, interesting. I think, given the position the two entries ... will undoubtedly ... Until Fool recognize brands ... Incas. The left. Wait, before you kill us, we entitled to a last request? A super cookie. You, out of there. Hey, birds. That must hurt. Hasta la vista baby. And now for the temple. I will not it down. They say there are things much dangerous in Inca temples. Ok, here is with Jeff and Belzoni. Good idea, boss. Good luck there. Let it brain bird, let's play poker. Help me father. Sara? What was that? Furthermore spirits. Spirits Inca protesting ... profanation of the place. Tad? There come closer. Should we kill him? Sure. Max? I mean, of course not. Sure. It is bad Sara. He hired these fools to kill Freddy and me. I hope not believe him. He is a pathological liar. I'm not lying, I saw you give orders. So do these lying? And when Sara will say you were an archaeologist. There were lying too? Tad, what is he saying? Go you, Professor Stone. Sara will say who you really are. He is one construction worker. A bricklayer. A nobody. What? Tad, is this true? Ok, he's right, I lied to you. I'm a big liar. But you should know ... That is enough. Tode. Can not just kill him boss? Chief? Max, which is happening here? We do not have time for this, max. Sara listens, I'm doing this for me ... For us. For our future. Kidnapped my father? It was necessary. Never plan to harm him. You try to kill you and Freddy Tad. Well, I can explain. Sorry. You'll regret you. Kopponen. The only thing I regret is the day I said I'd marry you. And to think you were my example. You're a fraud. Shut up monkey. Move it. How could I be so blind? As I in love with a man like that? The fault is not yours, he tricked me. He's a liar. As thou. You lied to me this time. Sorry Sarah. Tried tell you the truth ... I was afraid that you ... Forget Tad, mentisteme. I trusted you, even confided in you. Sara, help me. Grab my hand. Can I pull up? Of course I can, but tell me first that everything you said about you is true. I was the biggest fan of Max Mordon. This must be the work of the mummies. They are alive, I've seen one. Do not be silly. If they were alive, no mummies. It is a contradiction. Wherever you are. They are here and frustrated. Well said monkey. You pig, you will not be importavas it had died down. To be honest dear father tau is who I really need. Now move it. Look, the protective ropes. The Incas used them to protect the supplies. White to silver, yellow for gold and brown to bronze. Do not look so shocked. I'm not a total idiot. So what do we do now? Look, there. Must be input room for the golden statue. Pulling the rope correctly, is our ticket for entry. Professor, please do. Yes, of course, as I was going to say. Okay, okay, you old peidoso. Yellow gold is. The whole room is a trap. Sara, a teacher, against the walls. But he does not know what ... Just do it. Idiot. Kopponen, kill him. Tad, the red string. It is correct. Sara. Goodbye, suckers. Father The golden statue. Stop human statue is off limits. Prepare to die. Ok, ok, excuse me. I'm sorry. I protected the statue for 500 years. And you will not be you m gonna steal that. Please forgive me. I Surrender. Please do not kill me. Matarte? This is not a weapon, only one ... Now I'm staying with eternal life. Calm al. Disappears, Tad Stones. It forces me, Max Mordon. As you wish. Tad. These well, sir? You're a salvavidas true. Unfortunately, he's dead now. My plummet. You think you can defeat my new pet? Give it up, Tode. Fight me, Mordon. Max no. Sara, welcome the spectacle. Today we crush insects. This is the last time I have I worry about you. Mason pathetic. Yes No We're sorry, Tode. Failed. Now, he's immortal. Do not come closer, just wait. I'm full of life. What? What is happen to me? You can be immortal. But not expect like. This is the price for eternal life, Max Mordon. No, this can not be true. Sara, help me. Stay away from me. Do not worry, you're very cute for a mummy. Vaiste fit well here. No, no, there must be a antidote to this curse. No, no. This is the reason because the mummies still live. Mummies can not live. This is a contradiction. This is great, also has knowledge about mummies. Somebody get personal therapy. Bring him here. Do not even think about it, Tode. My name is Tad. What you gonna do, kill him? A absurd if you think about it. Oh my God, the treasure of the Incas. It's real. Bring it to our cell darker.
