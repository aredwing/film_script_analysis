For centuries, astronomers have searched in vain... ...to solve this mystery. It has challenged the creativity of the world's greatest writers... ...and the imagination of its most gifted artists. Some envisioned Martians as huge, birdlike beasts. Others described fantastic serpents of incredible size... ...grotesque, tentacled creatures. Shapes, sizes and forms beyond man's wildest imagination. Animal, vegetable, mineral... ...even mechanical creatures of enormous destructive power. But all this is conjecture. At last, you will learn the simple truth about life on Mars. As Normandy Productions lights the fuse... ...that put The Three Stooges in Orbit. Where you will meet the true image of the men from Mars. Hollywood, California. Glamour capital of the world... ...where movie history was first written by such greats as Valentino... ...Fairbanks, Pickford. Today a new chapter television.

Wait a minute, I heard it the first time. Welcome to Hawk Hill, gentlemen. I'm Professor Danforth. You came in answer to my advertisement -Yes, we did. -Quite a cozy place you got here. Thank you. Great-grandfather built it over 100 years ago. No! It doesn't look a day over 98. Thank you, and won't you come in, please Okay. As you can see, I've got lots of room here, plenty of-- I see you're interested in my new invention. This, gentlemen, is my all-purpose military vehicle. The full-scale model is nearing completion in my workshop. I've been working on it for months. Here are the plans. This button operates it underwater. This one propels it up in the air. And this one puts it in orbit. I think this guy's in orbit already. Sorry, professor, but I'm afraid we'd be in your way. -We'll be seeing you. -No. No, wait, please. My days are so lonely and monotonous. It's momentous. Hey, I said it! Quiet. It will be so nice to have earthlings in the house for a change. Pardon me, did you say, earthlings That's right. I'm often bothered by a spy from outer space... ...who's trying to steal my plans. A terrible-looking thing. Claws instead of hands, a hideous green face, sharp yellow fangs. Oh, the regular monster type. Monster That's right, yes, exactly. -Okay, professor, we'll stay. -Yeah, sure. -What have we got to lose -Yeah. Thanks. William will show you to your tombs. I mean rooms! Moe -About that professor-- -Don't pay any attention... ...to what the old guy said about the spy from outer space. He's been bending over those diagrams too long. Well, just the same, I'm taking no chances. -Where did you get that -Off the wall. Chicken. If anything happens, I'll be across the hall. Now get some shuteye. We gotta be in shape for our show tomorrow. -Good night. -Good night. On this monanimous occasion.... That's not right. Moninimous. -Modinimous-- -Dream about it! Turn out the lights, I'm bushed. Moe, they're here! -They're here! -What are you yelling about -They're here. -They're here Who's here -From outer space. -You're off your rocker. No, listen to me, Moe. I'm telling you the truth. Oh, Mable, you're here at last. You swept me off my feet. I'm being carried away. I'm safe. Safe in your arms, darling. Safe. He's here. The spaceman, I saw him. A guy could get murdered. -It'll be you if you don't let me sleep. -Moe, please. Come on. I'll show you. Come on, right in here. I know it happened right over here. I'll show you. Right there. The claw came through there. It looked just like a can opener. Then it pulled the chain like that, and then it went back in the wall... -...and this covered the hole. -Hole The hole is in your head. Why can't you be like Larry, sleeping like a baby Move over, Larry, and let Joe in. Move over, I said! Now, any more trouble out of you, and I'll give you something to yap about. Look! Gotcha! Hey, I got him, Moe. A tourist from Mars. Yeah, sure, with a card from the Diners Club. Hey, lift him up. I'll look for a rope. -Hey, Moe, it's the butler! -It's always the butler.

No, he's innocent. It was the butler. He's got a space gun. What did he say Come on. Well, I'm not afraid of that popgun. That probably shoots corks. Kazakoni yourself. Got a long way to run, fellas! You leave my machine alone. Stop, I tell you--! -Wait a minute, fellas. -What do you mean -We've got a long way to run. -We don't have to run. -We got a car outside. -Yeah -Yeah. -The keys are in my pants upstairs. Would you like to go get them Well, like you say, Moe, we've got a long ways to run. Wait, wait, wait! Martians! Flying saucers! FBI Never mind the clerks, I want Mr. Welby. -Welby here. -Mr. Welby, I talked to you before. Professor Danforth. Yes, professor, what can I do for you this time That butler I told you was after my invention Well, he's from Mars, all right. I just caught him talking to his boss on closed-circuit TV. I tell you, they're coming after us with scads of flying saucers. Send someone right over. I'd love to, professor, but unfortunately all my men are busy right now. We're rounding up a herd of man-eating caterpillars from Venus... ...that are trying to crush city hall! What's the matter, you a nut or something Mr. Welby Mr. Welby, come back! They're gonna blow up the whole world. Hollywood television studio, Stage 1. The Three Stooges. Somebody's gotta listen! Come on, fellas, we've got less than an hour to make our TV show.

And I don't mind saying I'm considerable riled... ...because you got here so late. And I hear you been doing this quite often. -But I can explain. -I don't want explanations. And another thing, if you hombres can't come up with a different type... ...of cartoon show, it's gonna be the end of the trail. What's wrong with what we're doing now -What kind of show do you want -I couldn't tell you, boys. I'm a businessman, not a showman. I just want something better than ordinary cartoons. -You've gotta come home with me. -We're in conference. Our cartoons ain't ordinary. I see the same thing on every cotton-picking show. -Mr. Howard, please. -Go away, professor, you bother me. On the other hand, if you can dream up something brand-new. Oh, they'll never make it, G.G. Their contract expires in 10 days. Okay, meet you here at 600 in 10 days. And remember, a completely different kind of cartoon show... ...or you're all through. Saddle up my Rolls-Royce, son, and I'll be on my way. Right away, G.G. Gentlemen, if your sponsor really wants something new... ...I think I've got it. Electronic cartoons. -Electronic -Exactly. The most startling new process since the magic lantern. -Boys, you help me and I'll help you. -Keep talking, grandpa. -Come back home with me. -Wait a minute. I wanna say that after you left, I caught that sneaking butler talking to Mars. I tell you, they're getting ready to invade us with flying saucers. I saw myself on his television set. -He's in orbit again. -He's flying. Boys, you've got to help me until my work is done. Remember, only us four can save the world from destruction. I'd hate to send for the wacky wagon, he's such a nice old oddball. Besides, maybe he's got something to save our show. I don't wanna find out. That joint gives me the creeps! Me too. Did you see what that kooky butler did All of a sudden, I'm aiming a gun that ain't there. Don't you jugheads realize we're in a spot You mean to tell me you'd let fear stand in the way of our careers -Yes! -Do you mean to tell me... ...that you're too chicken to face up to that kooky butler Yes! -With three against one -Absolutely! Oh, absolutely Don't you know that we absolutely left all our clothes... ...and our only absolutely car up there, and you still refuse Absolutely! We just took a vote, professor. It's unanimous. We're going. Excellent, my car is right outside. Ten days, 240 hours. You'll never make it. Goodbye, gentlemen. -Au revoir. -Skip the gutter. Break a leg. Ogg and Zogg. Here we are, gentlemen. -What's the matter with you -Moe, I'm scared. -Me, that's who. -And me too. -What's the matter, you chicken -Yeah. Have a little backbone. Follow me. Carol! Father, I couldn't imagine where you've been. I didn't know that you were-- I thought you were-- Oh, this is Mr. Howard and his friends. They're staying with us for a while. -My daughter Carol. -I'm pleased to meet you. -Oh, the pleasure's ours. -Likewise, I'm sure. I'm sorry if we scared you. I didn't expect you back from New York for another couple months. -I got some time off, so here I am. -It's wonderful to have you back, dear. We've got something to attend to. We'll be right back, dear. All right, Father. It's nice to have guests in the house again. Gentlemen, this way. I followed him right through there. -Did you have your glasses on -Glasses No. Oh, still chicken, eh Get going, come on. Look out for that first step! Now he tells us. Not here. Here, around the corner. -I don't see no TV set. -Are you sure it was in here Of course I'm sure. It was right over here. You better put your glasses on, pop. Well, they could have been over there-- No, he was on the right... ...the television set was on the left, and that was right. I just don't understand it. He must have gone and taken that whole TV outfit with him. I'll bet there's no electronic-cartoon gadget either. I heard that, and that's where you're wrong, mister. Come along with me, and I'll show it to you. Hey, professor, that's some contraption you've got there. Thank you, thank you. I don't know whether to call it... ...a seagoing heli-tank, a land-going heli-sub... ...or an airborne what-in-the-hel-- Excuse me. Anyway, it'll be interesting to see who'll win the battle for it... ...the Army, Navy or Air Force. Gentlemen, this is the machine that is going to save our world. Let's get to something really important. Where's the gimmick that's gonna save our show Gimmick Oh, that's over here. Your sponsor will renew your contract in a minute... ...after he's seen what I can do with this. Okay, put on your glasses. My electronic process, gentlemen. No artist ever touched this. The whole thing was drawn by a machine. No artist, eh Boy, that's amazing. Sensational! Now, all I have to do is figure out how to make it move. There's nothing like a hearty breakfast to start the day off. You know, we ought to humor the professor... ...until he finishes that cartoon gizmo. -Yeah, you never know. -Home cooking, home cooking. Hey, get your hotcakes here! Hey, fellas, the landlady! Well, what can I say, fellas When I heard the knocking, it rang a bell. -Oh, it rang a bell -Yeah, but I saved my hotcakes. -Well, so you did. -Yeah, they're mine. I baked them up-- -Oh, my, what happened -Well, it was an accident, professor. See, this is the work of a birdbrained idiot. Yeah, a birdbrained idi-- -Thank you. -How about me Yeah, and a mental midget. Go ahead. Look, Father, the mail! The Army, the Navy and the Air Force. I told you there'd be a scramble for my machine. The Army. Professor Danforth. Dear sir, your invention is most interesting... ...but we feel the submarine feature makes it more suitable for the Navy. -The Navy. -The Navy. The Navy feels the tank-tread feature makes your device... ...more suitable for the Army. Listen to this from the Air Force. The airborne feature of your unique vehicle... ...opens up interesting possibilities. Accordingly, the Air Force will accept your kind invitation... ...and send a representative, Capt. Andrews... ...who will be pleased to witness the tests that you propose. Afterwards, if results warrant, we will consider a demonstration... -...of the full-scale vehicle. -Oh, boy! They're coming, they're coming! I knew they wouldn't turn me down. -Congratulations, professor. -You sure put it over. Thank you. You know, I stayed up late last night testing the model... ...and everything worked fine. Come, I'll show you. Clean up this mess. I'll clean it up when I'm ready. -Oh, you will -Yeah, when I'm ready. -So -So I'm ready! Hello. -I'm Capt. Andrews, Air Force. -Won't you come in Yes. I'm Carol Danforth. I was hoping you'd come-- My father was hoping.... Well, he's right over here. The remarkable thing about this model is that it operates... ...completely by remote control. This is Capt. Andrews of the Air Force. My father, Professor Danforth. -And our guests Moe and Larry. -How do you do, professor -Are you making a mistake! -I'm sorry, sir. -That's a bigger mistake. -No, no, no. I'm Professor Danforth. Yes, excuse me, professor. Well, here she is, captain. What do you think of her -Wonderful. -When hard pressed by the enemy... ...it can take to the air, dash across country or dive underwater. As a matter of fact, it even seeks out water. First, I'll demonstrate how it operates as a tank. See that, captain It's gonna revolutionize the art of warfare. It'll even revolutionize revolutions. Remember, the big machine will do everything the little one does. Could you ask for anything more No. Oh, no, no. Definitely not, it's excellent. You know, captain, you're pretty sharp. The Army and Navy didn't-- They didn't get here in time. Of course, they're hot for it too, you know. Prepare for the water test. -Prepare for the water test. -Prepare for the water test. Captain, nothing can stop this vehicle except this. Watch. Captain, nothing can stop this vehicle except this. Watch. Ready for the water test. -Ready for the water test. -Thank you. Now, when attacked by antitank weapons... ...the pilot has only to push a button. Now, watch how it finds the nearest water. Wait a minute, I gotta open the door. Wait a minute! -This way, captain. -Yes, this way, captain. Right this-- Professor, I think it needs a little adjustment. Oh, Carol, why don't you take the captain and talk things over Come on, captain, this way. I don't understand. Watch it, that thing's going berserk. -Where is it -I don't know. Come in! Who is it Get out of here! Go on! Sounds like Curly-Joe. Come on! It's running wild! Hey, fellas! Hey, professor! The propeller! What's going on in here Turn that thing the other way! Shut it off! Shut it off! Hi, fellas. Oh, remote control! Cover your eyes. Moe, Larry's cheating. What are you doing Shame on you. Well, captain Is the Air Force interested Oh, yes. I can assure you, sir, the Air Force is definitely interested. That's wonderful! The big machine will be ready to demonstrate next week. My baby, I just love you! That's it. How you doing, boys Not much time left. Don't worry, you'll be showing it to the brass right on schedule. Controls all checked out, professor. Good, good, I'm working out all the bugs on the cartoon machine too. -She'll be ready. -What a team. -He's got the brains, and we've got-- -What -The enthusiasm. -That's better. Larry! Joe! -Shut it off! -Turn it off! Shut it off! -Joe! -Cut the motor off, Larry boy! Pull the lever on the compression chamber. Larry! Joe! Shut off this thing! -Larry! Joe! Help! -Shut it off! Hurry! Shut it off, boys! I'm sorry, Moe. It was an accident. Oh. Well, this is on purpose. Polka Dot. Sweetens the breath, brightens the teeth. Tastes like pizza! Polka Dot toothpaste, for the smile of youth and beauty. Polka Dot toothpaste, for the smile... ...of glamour and beauty. -Wait a minute, lunkhead. -Why, what's the matter I'm busy. -You're busy -Yeah. Get another big bag of water. The airfield's in the middle of the desert. So it's in the middle of the desert. How you coming, professor Oh, this will do for the demonstration. My own secret fuel. Got more get-up-and-go than anything ever on the market. -I don't believe you said that. -Well, I did because it's true. -Someone to see you, Father. -Hello. -She's all gassed up and ready to go. -Wonderful. I thought everything was set for day after tomorrow. It is, but Col. Lane would like to have you at the base a bit ahead of time... ...to kind of go over the details. He invited the area commander, Gen. Bixby. -Gen. Bixby! -Tom's arranged to fly you there... -...in his plane. I can go too. -If it's all right with you, sir. -Yes. Oh, but the machine-- -Don't worry about that. -We'll get her there okay. -Professor, you go with the captain. -And leave the driving to us. -They'll take good care of it. -No, I'm more familiar with it-- -See you at Baldwin Air Force Base. I wouldn't want anything to go wrong, honey. Don't worry, professor, you left everything in good hands. Don't worry, professor, you left everything in good hands. All right, let's get this mockingbird on the road. Here. Moe! Moe, we got a problem! What do you mean, we got a problem All you have to do is drive this thing right through that door. What-- Oh, no, it can't be. Yes, it can. The machine is too big to go through the door. -Get away from here. -What's that for That's for not thinking of it before. Now you guys get busy... ...and widen that door a few feet while I check the controls. -So we'll widen the door. -All right, all right, take it easy. -We'll widen the door. -Go get the tools. The tools there. There's a dandy. Yeah, you work on that side, and I'll work over here. Pick out a good spot here. -That ought to do it. -Hey, bubblebrain! -What -You're using the wrong side. Wrong side Oh, yeah. How silly can you get -Wait, you're still doing it wrong. -What do you mean -You mind if I show you -No, but I, I'm-- Look, take this. See, when you got a tool with two heads on it... ...and the first head is pointy, you take it right there and the pointy part... ...goes right in that wall there. -That's where the pointy part belongs. -Yeah, how stupid can you get I don't know, I guess you can get pretty stupid if you're like me. Boy, oh, boy. Here we go. Termites -Larry! Larry! -What's the matter -Did you hit yourself -No, I didn't hit myself. Something hit me through that hole there. Come right out, hit me. -You see, you see. -You're crazy, there's nothing in there. What do you mean, there's nothing there -Larry, Larry! Again. Again. -What did you do, hit yourself again Didn't hit myself again. It came through the hole again. -Oh, don't bo-- -You'll see it. Look, can you see it -See it -There's nothing there! -Now get to work! -All right, so there's nothing there-- Oh, yeah What-- Oh, no. You're still playing around We got work to do. I ain't playing around with-- Good work, boys! At last, you did something right. But, Moe, we didn't-- -Did we -Come on, boys, hop aboard. We don't want to keep the professor waiting. Get in there, come on. Attaboy. -I hope you can make it. -There's not very much room there. Have no concern. When I throw this throttle in, we will ease slowly through the opening. Twenty-two minutes late! I can't wait for this thing much longer. Sorry, general, but the captain assured me that it'd be here. Here it comes! Let's make a snappy entrance. Believe me, this is going to be something you'll never forget. Hey, boys! Right here! There's the professor. Hi, professor! -It's Moe! Moe's driving it! -Come back here! Look out, professor! Shut her down, you bubblebrain. Well, professor, perhaps your machine isn't quite ready yet. Oh, yes, it is, sir. Besides, I want you people to have it... -...before the Martians get it. -That's a very good-- -What did you say -The Martians, they want it. Look, the airplane! -Put on your brakes! -I can't find a pedal. -Use the emergency! -The emergency. -You mean this -Yeah. The airplane! -That was close. -You did it. You got us over that, boy, you are a doll. Col. Lane, get that ship off the field! -Ground that thing, that's an order! -That's an order! Don't look now, but I think we're being followed. -Maybe we'll get a ticket. -Hey, can you get one for my friend Come on. The bookstore! Bookstore! Up, up, up! Easy does it. You came through again, Moe. Bookstore! Come on, you idiot. Look out, girls! Hey, Moe, you're heading for the general! Look out, you'll knock him on his brass! See that that goes back where it belongs. Eyes right! Sir! I wish to report-- Now see here! Oh, dear me. -Andrews! -Yes, general What have you got to say Well, I'm sorry I listened to that old crackpot, sir. -Father, we're going home. -Carol! Wait a minute, I'll take you. No, thank you. This time we'll take the bus. And leave the court-martial to us! How do you like that Visibility zero. -Yeah, and you can't see either. -No, you-- Get that map out of my face! You want me to wreck the ship I want to see what road we're on. You applebrain, we haven't been on a road since we left the air base. -How are we fixed for gas -How are we fixed for gas Well, the arrow's pointing halfway... ...so I don't know whether it's half-empty or half-full. -Remind me to wallop you later. -I'll make a note of it. I'll do it now. What are we stopping here for -What are you stopping for -I didn't stop it. It's the engines. Well, come on, we got a repair job to do. You are about to witness a test of the Navy's new atomic depth charge... ...which has been placed at the base of this tower. This is the bomb. Powerful enough to destroy every enemy submarine... ...within a radius of 6 miles. And utterly devastate an equal area on land. The bomb is adjusted to maximum sensitivity. The slightest contact with moisture will set it off. However, for test purposes... ...it will be exploded by dropping water on it from this tower. The countdown will now begin. Gentlemen, put on your safety glasses. Well, that takes care of the distributor. Just had a little sand in it. -Give me the carburetor. -Give me the carburetor! Give me the carburetor, give me the carburetor. Here it is. Seven, six.... Three, two.... -Hurry up! -Here you go. One of those crazy desert cloudbursts. What happened Gentlemen, I don't understand it. That was enough water to detonate a dozen bombs. -Boy that was tight, but I made it fit! -Yeah. All it takes is a little know-how. Hey, what are you doing, swimming in a mirage -No, fellas, I was just standing there-- -Yeah, yeah, just standing there. Well, stop standing there and climb aboard! Climb aboard, all right, climb aboard. Down with the hatch! There's some kind of vehicle out there. Gentlemen, someone has stolen the bomb! Security! Security, this is an emergency, an emergency! All right, now, men, hear this. This is it. Contact. -Boy, what power! -If the professor could see us now! All because we cleaned a little sand out of the distributor. Yeah. -Talent shows. -It does -Take over, I'll check the Fathometer. -Okay. -Hey, we're not doing too bad. -Okay up there. Hey, fellas, get a load of the news. Officials of Los Amigos Proving Grounds... ...were thrown into consternation when a new atomic depth charge... ...was mysteriously stolen from its test site seconds before being detonated. -How do you like those crooks -Authorities warn... ...the tremendous destructive power of this bomb... ...will be unleashed at once on the slightest contact-- Can you imagine stealing an atom bomb It just shows you how stupid some people can get. -Get away from there! -All right. -As you were! -All right, I'm sorry. -But it's disgusting, I'll say that. -Yes, you are. Not me, the people who stole the bomb, stupid. We're flying! A lake. Full speed on the choppers! We haven't gone underwater yet. Let's try the submarine bit. You lamebrain, you saw what happened with sand in the distributor. What will happen with water in the carburetor -So, what could possibly happen -You could possibly get a busted skull! All right, all right. -We're flying! -We're in the air! -Blue water. -Blue water. Remember, keep your cotton-picking fingers off that orbit button. -What do you think, I'm dumb -I don't think, I know. Well, I don't think you know either. As I was saying, keep your cotton- picking fingers off the orbit button. -What do you think I am, dumb -I don't think, I know. -Well, I don't think you know either. -Come on. Hey, didn't we just do that -Did you see what I just saw -A flying submarine -Flight 707 to Control-- -No, not a flying submarine. -No, we didn't see it. -No, no, no, we didn't see a thing. I know the boys did their best, but it's plain... ...my machine wasn't ready after all. I just hope they didn't injure themselves. I guess Tom was right, maybe I am just an old crackpot. -Oh, Father, it's not true. -It is, Carol, it is. As far as that flying buzz saw is concerned. Not this camera, honey. This is gonna work just like I promised. I'll make it up to them. -Hi, professor! -Hi, Carol! -Boys, boys, am I glad to see you! -We were so worried! -I don't know what about. -We got news for you. We made a few minor adjustments, and your chariot spins like a top. You can tell the Air Force to order another demonstration. -We'll really show them something. -In due time, due time, boys. -Wait till you see the surprise I've got. -Surprise Okay, professor, don't get excited. Okay, what Well, here she is, fellas, all finished. Hey, that's wonderful! But will it work Certainly! Don't you have any confidence in the professor Don't forget, boys, this is the 10th, the day your contract expires. -You've only got until 600 tonight. -Six o'clock. By golly, he's right! Don't worry, I'll get you under the wire. We'll make a test film right now... -...and rush it to the studio. -You have things to do. I better get out of your way. -Okay, Carol, good night. -We'll see you. Move this thing around and get some lamps. We'll need lots of lights. -We'll put it right about here. -Bring in that 10k over there, Larry. Come over here and get yourself assembled in a position so I can.... Good, good! Now we'll get some makeup... ...and you'll be all set here. That's it. Very good. -Oh, good. Yeah. -Yeah, and now.... That's it. -That's it. Good. -Okay, professor. Now, I'll get your special costumes. Don't worry about the makeup. It's a special quick-drying polyunsaturated titanium.
