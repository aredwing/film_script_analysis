You're supposed to be in Vermont. We need to talk. What? You come sneaking in here at 3:30 in the morning because we Need to talk? I lay for a while in that stupid motel. After we talked. And then I went out for something to eat, all the While trying to convince myself that what I was Thinking wasn't true. But I didn't get to where I got by dodging the truth, so, I jumped in the blazer and I hit the road. Really? Gosh, I don't know what you're talking about. I... I really, I just don't have a clue. It's um, and as for the candy, you know people in glass Houses shouldn't throw stones. Well there you go with your passive aggressive stuff again. You never change. I can read you like a book, honey. You're upset. And it's my fault. And I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart. You found my secret hiding place in the garage. I really haven't Absolutely no idea. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You did a great job putting everything back where it belonged, except the box was a little to the left of where I Usually put it.

Under your car. Which, by the way, needs an oil change, Which you always forget. Sometimes you can be so smart about about some things. And so dumb about others. Like clearing the search history. You always forget to do it. What? The search history. It's the first thing I checked when I came in. And... Okay, I admit it. I had a pudding cup. So I guess I am a person that lives in a glass house. Really, you checked my computer? You dirty sneak! Oh... Darc, I've been doing it for years. I have a very bad friend that does very bad things, and when You're a man in that position... You have to stay current on those closest to you. And since the kids left home, that would be you. And you haven't just been checking on Marjorie duvall. You've been checking on all of them. Whoops! Who's... bad friend? What... what bad friend? The kid I chummed around in junior high with. I told you about him after we were married. Yeah, but he's d... Dead, yeah. Got hit by a truck chasing a baseball onto the street. Poor old Brian. You're not making sense, bob. Ahh. I guess you'd have to be there. There were these girls that snooted us in the 8th grade. Diane Ramage. Laurie Svensen. And a couple of others. Anyway, Brian came up with this idea that we would catch One of them alone. Well, maybe two. One for each of us. We were going to say to them That if they fucked us real good Like they fucked their boyfriends on Saturday night, We'd let them live. And this was um... This was all your friend Brian's idea? Well... Look, those girls were snoots. Like, like, like Betty next door. Did you see the way that she was running her tits all over Me at the party? Well, yeah, she was drunk. Yeah. But Darcy, you have to realize that... I didn't kill those women. Not really. It was another person inside my head. I fought it for years, the voice. And then I just... I just thought, I'll do it, once. Get it out of my head. If I get caught, I get caught. At least, at least it won't be in my head anymore. Won't have to think about it, wonder what it would be like. All these years, you've been fighting him. Is that right? The beadie inside you? Yeah, yeah. I have, And I could fight him forever if, if I thought that There was a future for us. If there was some way that we could, you know, just... Turn the page. Well, if I don't... I suppose that I become Beadie's next. Oh Darcy come on. Honey, this is not some, some movie where the psycho husband Chases the screaming wife around the house. I would never let beadie hurt you. You know that, don't you? Anyway... Even if you were to turn me in, I wouldn't lift a finger. But... But? You have to think about the kids. And you have to think about yourself, Darcy. Honey, you have to think about yourself! Who is going to believe that you lived with me for all These years and you didn't know? - I didn't... - Didn't even suspect. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, not once. You know, and then you would have to move, and the Anderson Coin and collectable company would be blackballed, I can Promise you that. And, you know, then there's the kids. They have to live with the shame and the humiliation and... Stop it, stop it, don't say that! Don't talk about them when you talk about this! Don't ever, just don't do it! Okay, okay. Can we, can we, look. Can we just put it behind us, honey? Oh god. I don't know. Hm? Okay. Just let me think about it bob. Let me think about it. Sure, sure. It's okay I, I... I understand.

And he who believeth on me, even if he die, Yet shall he live. So we commit thy servant, Robert Anderson, To the ground. In the sure belief that the good works of his honest life Will recommend him to thee on the day of judgment. Hang in mom. Almost finished. Would the family like to approach? Rest in peace, pop. Miss you, dad. They were very special to me. Then why didn't you put them in the coffin? I forgot, pets. But, hush. May the lord bless you and keep you. May the lord raise up his face upon you. Nice dress. If it was any shorter you could see her a... don't you, ever. Ever! She's just upset. Boy, is she ever. Do you think there's any booze in that limo? I could use a drink. Yeah, I'm buying. Ah, thank you so much Mrs. Anderson. God bless you. Mhmm, you too father. You're very welcome. Some good comes of our greatest losses. If you say so. Hello. Mrs. Anderson. Yes. Can I help you? Yeah, I... Whoops. Oh. Well thank you. Holt Ramsey. I'm with the office of the state's attorney general. Does ret mean you're retired? Heh, well, I'm an old dog. They toss me a bone now and then, I chew on it. Oh. I think I've seen you. Have you been here before? According to the Hindus, we all have. Yes. Um, what can I do for you Mr. Ramsey? Inside would be better. Oh... My, this is... A lovely home you have here missus. Look, a place for everything, and everything in its place. My wife would have approved. How I miss her. Just the way I imagine I miss your husband. Yes. Um... What may I do for you, Mr. Ramsey? I'm sorry, or is it detective Ramsey? Heh, donkey ears since anyone called me "detective." No, you go straight to Holt. That'll do me just fine. But, the thing is, I get bored, just the TV for Company, so I thought to myself "I'll, what the hell, I'll take that drive down to cleaves mills and I'll just Ask a few of my little questions." Here. Have a look. Turn it over. Oh, I see you do know my name. Indeed I do. Both your names. Uh, bob, Darcy. BD. Beadie. Look at you. Look at you both. Rubbing our noses in it the whole time, weren't you? I'm sorry. There are twelve women who are dead missus... I'm surprised you can laugh at that. Um, sit down right there, and just be quiet. Troublesome man. Never touch that stuff. You know you're crazy. Could be. But I noticed you haven't asked me to leave yet. I mean... Agh, I probably don't have much of a case, you know that. Mm, you have no case. Doesn't matter, missus. There are ways, and there are ways. Once I come upon this fella, way far upstate. Killed his wife, two kiddies. Tried to make it look like home invasion. I chewed on that old bone. Got a taste for it. Chewed that bone 'til the fella got nervous and he ran. Mhmm? And what happened to him. I chased him. Right up into the Haynesville woods. You know? Where the song says there's a tombstone every mile. Well, he crashed. And I crashed right after him, and that's how I got this leg, not to mention this steel rod that I got in my neck. Mm, I can tell you when it's going to rain. And the kid that you were chasing? What did he get? He got death. Burned to death in his car. Saved the state... 40-50 years room and board in Shawshank. You are quite the hound of heaven, aren't you Mr. Ramsey? "I fled him down the night and down the day." "I fled him down the arches and veers." "I fled him down the labyrinthine ways." And so on. Did you learn that in school? Methodist youth fellowship. Oh. I won't let you ruin my children's lives. Well, if you think about it missus, It wasn't me put ruin in their way. You think about it. Go ahead if you want to, but... I don't think you'll get away with it twice. What's the worst thing that you ever did? Come on. Two can keep a secret If one of them is dead. And you'll be dead soon enough, won't you? Huh. You recall that fella I told you about? The one who killed his wife and kids? Mm. Well, after he wrapped his mustang around a tree, I... I just sat and I listened to the screams. For quite a while. Finally they stopped. And then I called it in. And who else knows? Only you. Because... People wouldn't understand, would they? Tell me something... Just what was it that you... Threw into the grave. They were the earrings that my husband... Gave me for my 25th anniversary. They were fish earrings because I was a Pisces, He said. And you know, they belonged to Marjorie duvall. He raped her. And he murdered her. And stole her earrings, and gave them to me. And I thought, "oh, he's just so thoughtful." Marjorie duvall's id was, uh, in this box. The box that his daughter made him for a school project. He promised to stop. Did you believe him? No. But I needed time to, uh, to think, and um... I wanted to spare my children. You didn't come here to kill me. You never would've brought this if you had. There's one thing that I can't quite get by. The initials. B-D. Beadie. Beadie was something else. When my husband was a boy, he had a friend Who was killed in an accident. It was a boy with... Fantasies. His name was Brian Delahanty. I guess he didn't like his first name very much, because When my husband was a kid, he used to call him... BD... Would you have caught him? Oh yeah. It's blurred, like it's two pennies. Yeah. Some people are that way too. I'll go now. And uh... You'll do what you have to do. Missus. The only thing I have to do... Is pay my taxes. It's not for me to punish you. You know your kids are gonna talk about how much they miss Dear old... Dad. And tell their grandkids about what a fine fella grandpa was. You're just going to sit there and listen. Nod, smile... Once in a while, even have to talk about the good old days. Mm. I can live with that. Darcy. Come over here, close to me. You did the right thing. Now would you mind putting my music on for me? All you big and burly men Who roll the trucks along You'd better listen, you'll be thankful When you hear my song. You have really got it made If you're hauling goods Any place on earth But those Haynesville woods It's a stretch of road up north in Maine That's never ever ever seen a smile And if they buried all the truckers lost in them woods There'd be a tombstone every mile It's a stretch of road up north in Maine That's never, ever, ever seen a smile And if they buried all the truckers lost them woods There'd be a tombstone every mile. Count 'em all, there'd be a tombstone every mile When you're talking to a trucker that's been hauling goods Down the stretch of road in Maine they call the Haynesville woods He'll tell you that dying and going down below Won't be half as bad as driving on the road of ice and snow It's a stretch of road up north in Maine That's never ever ever seen a smile And if they buried all the truckers lost in them woods There'd be a tombstone every mile, count em all There'd be a tombstone Every Mile I can see you smile And I can hear you Say hello You're everywhere I go Such is my love Even though I try I can't forget the way you sigh My heart can't help but cry Such is my love I just go on Longing for your kisses Still thrilling to your charms I never spend a day without dreaming You're right here in my arms If you only knew The restless nights my heart goes through I'm helpless, what to do How can I hide The tears I keep inside Such is my love Such is my love The tears I keep inside Such is my love
