As soon as we arrived, we took a walk. The guide pointed to a clover and said... 'We can eat this' and ate it. Then a few people tried it. It tasted strange and bitter. But we thought it was a good experience. But they wouldn't give us any food. When we asked at night why there's no food... He said, 'Didn't you eat the plants during the walk?' - Who? Who? - What! The darn guide said! 'Didn't you eat the grass on our walk?' Let go! Co-producer Seok-bin JANG Help me! BEDEVILLED How many times did I tell you? Low-income families can get up to $30,000 But you have no income, so the maximum is $20,000 But you said I could I already moved. That was the maximum. Anyway, we can't lend you $30,000 so borrow it from someone. If I could, why would I ask for a loan? Then move to a different place. But I paid the deposit and moved my stuff in! So, try borrowing from someone else. Who' d lend money to a single, old woman! You should've made sure before signing the lease. But you said I could have the money! I never said that! Ma'am. Hello? Stop calling, please. I'll be out for a sec If the manager asks for me... Please leave now, ma'am. Next Counter Please. I'm working. Sorry, but you're always so busy. And you never write back Can't you come for a visit? I gotta go. They can't see me for sure? Of course Strictly confidential. They look about right. You're right. Excuse me? The victim's friends saw them bothering her at a nightclub. Isn't that all you need? But they didn't witness the assault That's why we need your statement. But, I didn't get a good look at theirfaces. But, I didn't get a good look at theirfaces. Just try to remember. It's them, but we have no proof. Sergeant CHOI! Sorry, ma'am. - He doesn't have the ring - A ring? Yes One of them had a ring with a skull on it. The doctor said it looked like a ring, too. But it's hard to tell the shape on multiple wounds. Don't contact me anymore. - But if you remember... - Then I'll call you. But unlikely. You bastards! Why won't you admit it! You did it! I'll kill all you bastards! - Please tell me everything! - Please! You said you saw them. Please tell me everything! You saw them! You saw them! Please, say what happened! You saw them! Please! Let's not meet again I got real scary buddies. Fucking up a bitch ain't nothing. - Did they say anything to you? - No. Would you like to go inside and talk? No. - You're back - She's still here? Everything's set Have your landlord sign this. Thank you very much! Thank you so much Thank you! What happened? - What did you tell the manager? - I didn't say anything about you. Ji-soo, you talk as if I made a mistake. Of course not ljust felt so bad for her. Are you close with the manager? Or close with all your male superiors? Be careful. There's a limit to how far a flirt can go in the financial world. Ji-soo... I'm really sorry A drink tonight? Ok, let's make up Where to? Hello? Hello! How about... Ms CHUNG! Get out! Take a vacation. Who is it? - Who is it? - The superintendent. - I don't recognize your voice - I'm a superintendent. What is it? Your mailbox is way overloaded. On vacation. Up until 10 years ago, boats went in twice a day. Now there are only 9 people left. Who are you visiting on Moo-do Island? My grandfather used to live there. - What was his name? - Suk-hwan KIM I knew it! You're Hae-won, right? I thought it was you! Remember me? 'Course you don't. You were so pretty back then Still damn pretty. You married? Of course you are! I'm not. Hurry! Hurry! - You're Hae-won, right? - Yes. Really Hae-won? Don't touch her with those dirty hands. Sorry. - You're really Hae-won, right? - Yes, I'm really Hae-won. It's you! Hae-won! Well, I'm off. She's here. Who? KIM's granddaughter? You're Hae-won? It's you alright You haven't changed a bit. Remember us? So pretty and white Is it from drinking Seoul's water? - That's right - Of course. That's my hubby Remember? Man-jong. That's his brother, Chul-jong Man-jong and Chul-jong. Oh please Don't call 'em by their names like that. Why'd you come here on vacation? There's nothing here. City folks like to come for. ...fresh and water on vacations. This ain't no tourist attraction. - When ya going back? - I'm staying for about a week. You'll change your mind in a day. Back to work If it rains, the potatoes will rot. Aren't ya coming? Bok-nam, come and help out. After I take Hae-won to her house. What's Chul-jong and that old man chewing on? Don't know? It's called bozo leaf Cuz you become a bozo chewing on it. Here. It's hot, ain't it? Remember? We wrote that there. Your grandpa got mad like hell. Mama? Go on Say hello to mama's friend. Come here What's your name? Yeon-hee don't know how to act around others. What grade is she in? She's 10, but she doesn't go to school. I want to send her. But Man-jong and his aunt don't think girls need schooling. Said, if she gets educated, she'll run away from us. Who doesn't send kids to elementary school these days? They even send kids to study abroad in kindergarten. Really? I hope I can send her to school next year. She goes to the school to read books these days. So I was wondering... It's been 15 years since grandpa passed away. How's this place so clean? Take a guess. I spent three whole days cleaning this place. Thanks you were saying? Huh? You were going to say something about Yeon-hee? It's nothing You just got here. You must be starving I'll go get some food. I'm going night fishing with Yeon-hee. - Really? - Yup. You always come back empty-handed. You love going fishing with papa? - Lazy-head not sleepin'? - You're back? Was it fun? Did ya catch anything? How can an islander be so bad at fishin'? You caught no fish for over 2 weeks. Why, so you can pig out if I do catch 'em? Not only me Yeon-hee, you, and that brother of yours. Didn't I tell you to show respect talking about me and my family? Even dogs and pigs learn if they get beaten Why not you! You a dog? Don't eat on the floor. This is why you need a man around. Even a dozen women Can't do that. Damn right. Nephew? Can you fix our shed afterthis? Sure. - How about our door? - Sure. Do it yourself. My nephew's dying doing all the work. Damn right. He can't die Without him, we're all dead. Damn right! What you doing? Don't just sit there Make some noodles. - Yes, ma'am - Finish that up, first. Yes, ma'am. Let her rest, she must be tired. It's nothing compared to men's work. What's KIM's granddaughter up to? Still sleepin' Damn woman still in bed in broad daylight. Seoul life must be really hard. Awoman's most happy with a dick in her mouth. Still not married and taking vacation? Stupid little girl. There's lots of women in Seoul who ain't married. So? You've been yappin' about Seoul a lot these days. - It's so good - Here, have some more. All this trouble for me I'll cook for myself now It's no trouble. Wanna go take a bath at the pond? The pond? Remember where we used to go when we were little? No one will look. People here all sleep after sundown. I'll go first to do some laundry Hurry up. - Give me your laundry, too - It's okay I'll do it. With these hands? No laundry rooms here, right? Seoul people do laundry in rooms? How strange. Bok-nam! This island has a lot of fresh water. We even had rice farms in the past. So clean and white. So smooth and slippery. Remember we used to bathe here at nights when we were kids? Yeah, the water was nice and cool. What are you doing! Oh, come on It's just me. Just scared me, that's all. About what? Nothing. Bet ya got men lined up like flies on a corpse, huh? Phones should work since they set a base station or somethin' up there. But who knows? The only phone here is the one at Auntie's house. What ya doing, Uncle? You like flowers? What ya doing, mama's friend? Mama's friend? Just call me auntie. Auntie? That's better Want me to read it to you? Fold 'em for me. Your mom will be upset if you fold up yourtextbooks. Mama gave 'em to me to fold 'em. What? All except this one Social Studies. - Why not? - Cuz it talks about Seoul here. I wanna get holes in my ears like you. Why you. I wish my boobs will grow big like yours soon. Scream! Scream bitch! - What's going on? - It's nothing. She's here again? I said scream! What's going on? Nothing Just foolin' around Watch Yeon-hee for me? Stay at auntie's house. Hold hands. Go on. Tell herto sell our honey, too. Yes, ma'am. How can ya eat listening to that? When another bitch is sucking on your hubby's dick. Look at you You're eatin' like a damn pig. I'm sorry. You're really tanned Put this on yourface It's sunscreen. Don't need your pity. I didn't want to come... ...but he paid my boss three times the rate. I'm sorry Really. Why are you sorry? You ain't the monster. You'll ruin your body like that. I know that. What the... How can you live with him? I'd run away. Probably kill me if I tried again. Where'd you run away to? Should've gone to Seoul. No one can find you there. Don't even need this Seoul water will make you white. Then why you living like that? Wanna run away together? We'll go to Seoul and work at restaurants or something. But a kid needs herfather. Who needs that? I grew up fine without a dad. Oh, right Real fine. Ain't ya fixing dinner? Hey! Dumb bitch. - What? - Get the rest of the honey. The boat's coming in tomorrow - After I cool off the stings - Why you little! Put bean paste on it. - What the hell you up to? - Stop cursing. What's with yourface? Just stung by bees. You let your husband get away with that? It's just a couple of stings. Not that. Right in front of you! He had sex with a girl in your room. ...and you act like it's nothing? We keep things to ourselves here. Not like you're gonna take me in. You need someone to take care of you? You're an adult You should take care of yourself. - Come on - It's hard. Not too close! My baby girl's home Let's go take a bath. What are you doing? I wanna be loved by papa, too. You said to try to get loved by papa. That ain't what I was talkin' about. Where'd you get this? Did you steal it from that girl? No. - Then where? - Gave it to me. The girl gave it to you? Answer me! Want me to beat it out of you! Papa gave it to me! Why would he give this to you? What about these bunny undies? Why's the laundry on the ground? Did you fight? Overthis? Damn girls. Put it on All overyour body, bitch! Don't get jealous of the kid! Let's just give it to your mama. I'll get ya something better. Take it and scram! Get the hell out of my sight. You've been laid off as per the Employment Law Manager. The caller you have reached is... Oh, hi. I'm leaving on the next boat I had a good rest thanks to you. I'm going be a new me when I get back to Seoul. Though it won't be easy to change all of a sudden. Thank you for everything. Can I come by often? What's this? Blood? It's not blood. Why's this on yourface? - Hae-won... - What's with you? - Hae-won... - What? Can't you take Yeon-hee and me with you to Seoul? You can go anywhere you want. But I don't know how to live on the mainland. It's the same Seoul is scarierto live in then here. - You said you'd take me - When? 15 years ago? Yeah Don't that count as a promise? Next time After I take care of something first. Next time, again? Fine Then just take Yeon-hee? Please? Why Yeon-hee? Don't ask why. Please, I'm begging you. If you take her, I won't call or write you no more. Oh, come on! Just tell me If you don't, I'm not taking her. I think Man-jong... Must have screwed... Yeon-hee. That makes no sense. What? I know you want to go to Seoul... But still, how can you say something like that? Try a more believable lie next time! You think I'm lying? You know what the bastards are like! I don't know anything! Reading? Why do you want your boobs to grow? Don't you know? That's how girls are loved. Yeon-hee... Does daddy love you? How does daddy love you? What ya doing here? Yeon-hee, come here. You're old enough to earn your keep. Stop idling around. - Take her and feed her - Sure thing. - But I need that book - Let's just go and eat. - You should take the next boat - There's something... Laws are meant to change according to circumstances. And Bok-nam's damn good at lying. She grew up like a beggar. She'll beg like a dog to get anything. Then let the police investigate. If you're so sure, why don't you report it? You know that Yeon-hee is not Man-jong's real daughter? What? If you're not going to protect this island, stop worrying and go. Mi-ran? It's me. It's Moo-do Island. Remember what you said before? About going to Seoul? - Mom - Quiet. - Where we going? I'm sleepy - We runnin' away. - Where? - To the mainland. Papa said the mainland's trouble. - You can go to school there - I don't wanna go to school! Then fine Just go where papa ain't. But I like papa I like it here! So you don't wanna go? - If I don't, you're not going either? - Of course not. If we don't go now, you'll get beat all your life? Then I'll go with you mama. Cuz I can't stand you getting beat. Let's go The boat's comin' That hurts Not so hard. - You crying, mama? - Never saw mama cry, huh? No, I heard you cry and say you'd rather die than live like this. - What's good about dying? - I'm sorry You're right. Rolling in dung is betterthan dying. I don't want to roll in dung! I warned you, not him! No one else would come here at this hour. Still, not him You stupid! Don't worry I don't care for people's business. Just pay me enough forthe boat. Where'd you get this? Oh no! Look! Mama! Hurry! Hurry! Come on! Let's go now! Man-jong's coming! Hurry! Please hurry! He's coming! I gotta count it! Shit, I lost my count! Let's go! - Hurry! - Let me count first! Where's my damn lighter? Got a light? - Hurry! - Hurry up! We'll go when I'm done counting One, two, three... Sis! Sis! Sis! Papa! - Papa! - Come here, you bitch! I take in a bitch with a kid! And you sneak off on me! You bitch! You bitch! Don't just stand there! Stop him! Break her damn legs! Like dogs and bitches who try to run away... Break 'em so she can't go! Get up! Stop your brother She's gonna die! Papa! Get up! Dumb fucking whore! Warned you to stay away from people's business! Stop it, papa! I'll live with you! Stop hitting her! I treated you good! And you betray your papa? Is it cuz I'm not your real dad? I'll show you how papa can get real mad! Are you okay! Stop it! Not Yeon-hee. Careful, Man-jong! Are you crazy? You can't throw stones at your husband! Awoman can get stoned to death but not a man? He took you and your kid in! You should be grateful, bitch! - Damn right - Of course. Quit saying that! Why don't I know who the father is? I was raped by more than one bastard! - By every single one of them! - Shut up! You filthy bitch! - Damn bitch! - Papa! You damn bitch! Yeon-hee? Wake up, Yeon-hee! - Get some water Hurry! - Yes, sis. Yeon-hee... Yeon-hee... Yeon-hee... Wake up. Let's go to Seoul... Yeon-hee... Stop fussin' bitch She'll be fine with some bean paste Move! Let go! Don't touch her! Let go! Get away! Get away! Thanks for coming all this way. Must be hard taking care of the elders. Why'd your aunt call me out here? How's yourfather doing? He said to say hello when I said I'm coming here. If you told me before, I would've called a doctor. You need a medical report to file a death these days. She just slipped and fell Ain't no different if a doctor sees her. Actually, I can draw up the report myself. I'm Yeon-hee's grandma. If you look at it, I'm her grandma, too. How would I look if you are suspicious of her death. - But her bruises are... - Bok-nam? Why don't you tell him? If we were lying, would her mama stay still? She's quiet Then, did she kill the kid? What did you say? Move for a sec. What did you just say? That bastard killed her He kicked her. She fell. I wasn't gonna say this but... If you're gonna blame me, I have no choice. This bitch here tried to pack up and run away this morning. - Ain't that right? - Huh? Yes, sir. Were you there too, when she died? - You don't believe me? - Go on I'm listening. I knew she was gonna run away But she tried to take Yeon-hee, too. I couldn't let that happen. So, I told herto leave the kid and go if she wants. - I even gave her some money - Yeah right. You never gave me a dime all these years! Then where's that money from? I stole it From that bastard's pocket. Boast why don't ya? Damn thief! Our nephew's trying to cover up. ...that run-away bitch's sins. - He's got a good heart - Good heart my ass! - Watch yourfucking language - Man-jong. It's money I made from the honey, anyways! Fine... I'm sorry for not providing you with much. There's not much here for her. So I told herto go and start a new life. But... - But the kid... Not her! - Man-jong. Let the kid decide. So? What did she say? A child would normally follow the mother. But her mama was so mean, the kid chose the stepfather. She held my ankle tight and begged to stay. But she pulled her away! And fell down Then bumped her head on a rock. God damn it. Bok-nam? Is that right? Then what about Bok-nam's friend? Did you see the child die? No I was sleeping at the time. Good work. The honey's foryou in the mornings. A big spoonful when you wake up. I should save good honey like this. Wait Bok-nam's friend said she's going back, too. Don't worry You're busy Go on. Get the stuff on the boat. - No, I'll carry them - It's okay. - What's this? - Boat fare It's not much. Wait! Wait up! She got something to say to him? What's her hurry? No need to hurry A boat will come tomorrow No more buses to Seoul today. Damn right. Bok-nam must be sad Shouldn't you console her? Damn right She could use a friend now Tell Bok-nam thanks. Seoul girls won't stand you messing with 'em. Especially with a witness. - Isn't it dirty? - Nope. You're laughing? Let go! Man-jong! Get her! Stupid Dumb bastards. Boat's in. Don't slack off and dig up potatoes before it rains! Damn bitch Building a grave in the yard. Scram! Or I'll bury you right next to that! Chul-jong! Let's go! Excited to go into town, Chul-jong? Move your scrawny ass. Come y'all and have a drink. So damn heavy Damn it. This is why we need a man around. They'll be back tomorrow Stop trembling. Bok-nam, take a break will ya? Sis? Don't she look a bit crazy? Sis? Strange if she weren't after losing her kid. Let her rest for a bit. She'd go crazy doing nothing She'll get over it fasterthis way. I'm doing her good. - I'll go get some fish - Really, sis? - Don't Get all excited - Okay, okay. Damn bitch ain't worth shit. How about a song? Oh time, do not come or go. My precious youth is gone I'm all old. Ari-ari-rang, Ssuri-Ssurirang, Arari-ga nat-nae. Ari-rang Arari-ga nat-nae. Were you born a beauty? I was born an ugly. Ari-ari-rang, Ssuri-Ssurirang, Arari-ga nat-nae. Ari-rang. I stared at the sun for long and it spoke to me. Said, if I hold back, I'll get sick! Say something! What's going on! She's... She's gone crazy! We need a man... at a time like this. The boat's coming soon The men will be back. ...ljust have to hang on till then. Auntie! Slow down! You're gonna fall! Damn whore! Damn you! Damn whore! Stop it, now! You've done enough! Damn bitch You're dead now The men are back. I came to this island when I was 15 I swam for over 50 years! You! Stay right here I'm coming back with the men! - Did you hear something? - Hear what? Nothing. Go check the hives See if they're okay from the rain. Damn stupid wife probably left 'em out in the rain. - Wanna stay for a drink? - Sure! Damn it, Auntie... Should've worn glasses. Why were all these potatoes left in the rain? Where the hell is everyone? Damn What's that stench? Out of Service. Hey, gramps! Everything okay? Says everything's fine. That man's living long. Remember when all the men died in the storm. ...except him? All the women beat him. ...saying he killed their husbands. Then they all took turns taking him home and feeding him. All except my mama that is. Your mom took him up the hill instead of your home. Where the fuck is everyone? - Watch your Damn language - Sorry. Dumbass. Respect your elderfirst Stupid bastard. I said, give me some water! Watch out! What the hell? You crazy bitch! You crazy bitch! Should tend to the funeral offerings... Why'd you kill them! Crazy bitch! Why! Why! Why didn't you just kill yourself! I didn't wanna die. Then I should live it up. You never opened up to me. Treated me like trash Always cold like a rock to me! That's why my dick never got hard in front of you. Is that why you touched my kid? Huh? Shut your damn mouth! If the cops get me, I'll tell 'em everything you did. Fine. Killing you is self defense. If you kill her, I'll call the cops. I'll kill you painlessly like a pig. What about her? Make it look like you killed her? Ortake her as my new wife? What? Why? Looks like the killer is scared to die. What would I be scared of? - I'm just sorry to you, honey - Honey? Crazy bitch. Does it hurt? A lot? Hold on I'll put bean paste on it. Doesn't hurt now, does it! Doesn't hurt now! You bastard! You damn son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! What the hell? Get up! Hurry! Let go! The fuck is wrong with this! Hurry! Hurry up you dumb bastard! What are you looking at? Hurry up you dumb bastards! I'm the only one here You crazy, too? Damn crazy bitch Shit! Fuck! Shit! Hurry! Hurry! Quick! Moo-do Island? At least $100 to go. Right now? Be right there. Hey, Jang! Sail over afterthe game. What game? I got nothing I'll go. What took you so long? Where you headed? Thinking of going to see Seoul. How long since you been on land? Since I was born. So about 30 years. Damn, didn't you go crazy being stuck there all your life? Do I look sane to you? Play me a song, why don't you Then I won't charge you. Aren't you getting off? There's a bus to Seoul on the main road. Have yourself a good trip. What's this for? There are kind people? Night Duty Room. Sergeant Seo? I'll notify headquarters and check out Moo-do Island. Yes, sir I'll call you from the island. Let go of me! Go away! Hey! Help! Let go! - Play it - What? Like back then. - What! - The song you played before. - Don't do this Bok-nam - Do what? Why are you doing this to me? You're too unkind. Here Go on. In the village... if someone would stop working... Auntie used to say... 'That's like Bok-nam... ...not picking out the weeds' I... Can't stand that anymore. I wandered today to the hill, Maggie... To watch the scene below The creek and the rusty old mill. Please have a seat. It was them. You bitch! You wanna die, bitch? Dear Hae-won, I miss you so much. My dear Hae-won, I miss you so much. I need to ask you a favor You're the only one who can help me. My dear Hae-won I miss you so much. Your friend, Bok-nam.
