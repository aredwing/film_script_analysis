Here, Chief. - Test books and evaluation pages. - Are you finished ? - Hmm Give me your car keys. Why? Mine collapsed. - When do I get it back? - When mine is repaired. - How do I get home? - Your problem. - Why do you treat me like this? - You train for the competition 24/7. Sleep on the shooting range. International Shooting Competition Before you start the competition,... ... let us remind you the rules of the World Tactical Shooting. Rule #1: Never point a weapon on a target you don't intend to destroy. Vincent Miles - French National Police, leading with 4 minutes 32 seconds. - with 95% of hits and sets a new record. Congratulations, Vincent. This is for you, from the French delegation. Don't forget to register it.... and don't ever cross the line. - Would you throw me in jail? - Yes ... of course. Your father must be proud, seeing you from where he is. Thank you, Christian. Beware ... from now on you will be envied. Take your time, Think things through. - Keep cool. - Okay. I'm glad you came. It means a lot. Yes, Isa. An armored truck? Some victims? We'll take it, give me an hour. - What did you say? - No ... nothing. - Congratulations. Excellent shooting, great. - Thank you. - Mr. Miles, Colonel Calhoun would like to see you - Would you follow me please? - Yeah, sure. You have a rare talent, son. Rare enough for me to offer you something we generally... ...reserve for the most exclusive members of our special forces. We'd like you to join our elite corps. ....and what for exactly? We work all over the world, closely with foreign governments, ...against terrorism. Your mission will be to flush out danger zones. Thank you sir, but I'm not your guy. I'm just a weapons man and instructor. How does a man who's such an expert in the art of killing prefer to play around than do the real thing? I hope you will take the time to consider my proposal. Mr. Miles. People with a talent as yours must reign in hell. Not serve in heaven. Recipients of military medals in memoriam Which division has such a good shooter? Lyon Before. I just moved to Tactical Aid in Nanterre. - Milo Cardena. - Vincent Miles. I know you. Congratulations. Thank you. What weapon? A gift from my father. I've modified it. - Installed a 'beavertail' grip. - Extended the magazine - Loosened the trigger mechanism - Polished the feed ramp. - And modified the hammer attachment. Want to try it? Here. OK ... Ready. Stand by. Go! 1.30 seconds. Where did you learn to shoot like that? Try mine - When was it checked? - Don't you dare... What is your best time, El Presidente? 2.92 seconds, can you beat it? Stand by. Go! 2.92. My best is 2.80. How do we determine, outside with fists? No, I give a beer for a ride, but I want a rematch. Sounds great, I can still teach you a thing or two. - Do you live here? - My father's workshop. Oh yeah? Here you go. Your father? Yes, he died when I was ten. Special Forces raid in Africa. The Commissioner Christian Chavez. He raised me. - They were best friends. - Who taught you to shoot? Mr. Denard. My instructor at the Academy. - Now head of anti-gang. - They didn't recruit you? They tried. Why didn't you accept? It's everyone's dream. Christian couldn't stand me working with with Luc. - Why? - They are at war. I stay out of it. Furthermore, I'm not made for the field. What's that gizmo? Hello? - Yes, Vincent? How are you, Luc? - Fine ... where are you? - At home, why? - I need 12 gauge cartridges, now. I'm with a friend and have no car. - I really need them, now. One minute. Hey Milo, you mind giving me lift? - No. - Thanks. - It's okay. - I'll text the address. - Luc Denard is the star of the anti-gang. - I know of no stars. - Hello. - Here Thanks, buddy. Here you go. Mr. Moise forgot the ammo. And we're in action in 30 minutes. - Worth a thank you? - Thank you. - Thank him. - And who is he? - Milo Cardena, Drugs. - Luc Denard, Anti-gang. Thank you. - Moise. - Tactical support? I just transferred. Come here. I haven't congratulated you. It's cool. - I would've come, but I couldn't. - It's okay, Christian came. - That's why I was busy. - We are OP. Lets roll... Come on! Thank you, boys. I owe you one. - Am I interrupting? - No. I'm on a homicide case and can use your help. An informant was gunned down in Barbs. The bullet went through him. This was extracted from the wall. - Christian sent you? - No. Last time I helped, the technicians gave me shit in front of Ricaud. The technicians are busy with the van attack in Aubervilliers. - It will take weeks to get a result. - I can not. Would you please? Okay, but keep it to yourself. - Did you find the cartridge? - No. I think it's from a large revolver, maybe a 44. It's a 12 gauge. Look here... The irregular marks indicate a smooth bore rifle. I would look for a minor hit man. Why are you here? You should work with us. - You didn't hear it from me. - Hear what? - I'm red, You blue. - No choice? No. You're the first one able to keep up. You're a killer, made for the trenches ...not in your workshop. Have you shot someone? - How many? - The more the better. - You? - Me, no. Never? You train assassins. It doesn't make sense? - Stop hiding. Work for me. - That's impossible. Why? I am on a project that requires time and attention. - Alright, so what is it? - I can't say. Come on ... out with it. - Do you really want to know? - No, I'm waiting for the bus. - That requires all your attention? - No, that's a classic 45. Watch this now... Damn, not possible... The bullet explodes when it hits... ...no exit hole, perfect for guys in kevlar. I call them "Mjolnir" hammer of Thor. - How many do you have? - Enough for further testing. It's still a prototype. - How much? - How much what? - What you sell them for? - Are you crazy? - It will be between us. - Forget it. They're not for sale. Tell me your price ... I swear. You don't understand. It would be illegal. - You should think about it. - I already have. Now get out. - Go away, Milo. - Think about it. - Yeah He's a cop. Just Scare him. - Why? - You ask questions? Don't hurt him to bad or send him to the hospital, OK. - You have two days. - OK. The car is shit, you could've fixed it before you lent it to me. Your brakes are dead and it's full of dents. A sin you don't treat your car as well as your weapons. Hey, roll down the window. Roll it down. - Is this your father's street? - What? - What? What? Is this your father's street? - What's that look for? - I don't have time for this? - You want to do something? - Pull off the road. - You need to pull off... - Park it then. Let's do it. Come on. Fuck you. Bastard. Son of a bitch. What the hell you motherfucker? I'll fuck you up. I'm going to fuck you up. Come on ... Come on ... - Please answer. - Luc Denard. Please leave a message. Give me your gun. - Why? - Because it connects you to the corpse. It was my father's. I know what I'm doing. Go home. I'll call you when it's over. What will you do? The less you know the better. Take my keys. Don't worry, I'll fix it. - Hello. - I'm downstairs. It's settled. You never had an accident or killed anyone. But hurry and call your boss to tell him about the car-jacking. This will explain your bruises and the disappearance of your car. Very well... Now you can work in the field with me. It won't happen. Please don't piss me off about it. I piss you off? I piss you...? You don't get it... I must make it clear to you. But first ... your mouth. Don't say I piss you off. Understand? This was a coverup. I had to call people, now you must return the favor. What do they want? You have so much to offer. Let's start with your cartridges...huh? While we're at it ... 3 Benelli Super 90 shotguns. 6 M4 rifles. 6 M&P 45 pistols ... Tactical equipment all untraceable. - You want me to rob the police armory? - Look, that's your problem. You have access to the central archive. You can modify, delete... Milo, I can't do that... - That'll cost 20 years in prison. - How much is what you did worth...huh? I have fingerprints, the weapon, the corpse ... - You remember this. - I'll remember. You're trying to fuck me. Oh no, I love you. Precisely. I love you. - Like a little bitch. - Fuck you! Can you feel my balls? - Can you feel my balls? - Get the fuck out !! You're in no position to negotiate. See you tomorrow night at 10 Do you want to delete 15 items? FILE IS EMPTY NO RESULTS So we're even. We'll be even when I tell you. I have unlimited access. You're not in the database. You're not even in Nanterre. Who are you? A person. And don't search, you won't find shit. You must go to the department. Hurry. We searched the area three times. Everyone has alibis. What more can we do? You covered everything? We must return. Christian thinks there's an accomplice. What's happening? Gang War. The guys who attacked the van in Aubervilliers were attacked in their Suresnes hideout. 2 million euros. Someone saw them. We found marked bills and three corpses. - How many men? - According to witnesses, six. Five inside and one out in a minivan, with dark windows, no plates. - Why you call me? - We found these cartridges. Ever seen something like these before? No. LIMITED ACCESS DELETE FILES? DELETE FILE MJLNER? The number you have dialed is not in service. The number you have dialed is not in service. Motherfucker! Son of a bitch, where are you? - Vincent? - Yes, Christian. A robbery went wrong in Sartrouville. Can you come? I am on the way, bye. Suresnes gang strikes again, but bigger. - Who are they? - Malik Al Sadr's men. His go-fast supply was the target These shells were left behind. The cars are clean. No fingerprints. We found nothing outside. Everything happened here. Are we alone on this? - Why did you take the case? - It connects to Suresnes. - It could be a different group. - They used the same cartridges. They're very unique cartridges and only one gang using them. Any ideas who? Cops or military personnel. Ex or still on duty. - Why so sure? - We have nine bodies. Nine modified shells. Very precise Shooting. The shells form an "L". They make a linear ambush. Assault Tactic called "L-formation". One group enters from the front. Another from the side to cover. This rigor is only learned in the army or the police. Yeah, get to work. Listen. You should be transferred to us. Your expertise in ballistics and scientific knowledge will save us time. - Without field experience I can't help. - Yes but... You helped us just by analyzing a deformed bullet. You have knowledge. That's sufficient. It's not me or my place here. And what about Ricaud? I spoke with Ricaud and he agreed to your temporary assignment. I need you. OK fine. - Hands up! - Lets go now! - And don't be a smart ass. Look at me when I talk to you. OK? Have you seen these cartridges? We shook them hard, if they knew anything they would've spit it out. We must search more at their homes. Another avenue to check is private manufacturers. - I checked. - Pardon me? - I checked, didn't find anything. - When did you do that? When you showed me the shells, I checked out manufacturers. Without telling us? That kind of information we share. Never forget. Understand? We should check the files of all the dirty cops. Christian shouldn't have picked you, you're not a cop or an investigator. You're just a kid who fixes weapons. Are you afraid of losing your job to a 22 year old kid? You're an insult to the department. It's not kindergarten. Alright, Joseph. I didn't take 20 years to get here. Hey, hey, hey! Relax! He's here to help! Hey, we support you since we must. But beware. Let go of me! This is ridiculous. Are you two year olds? - Is there a woman in your life? - No. No girlfriend? Don't you want one? No. Someone to talk to... Someone waiting for you? No. Am I too direct? What is it ... Shyness? This is wonderful. You have a daughter? I have a 5 year old girl, very cute. What's her name? Her name's Sioban. She's beautiful. - Good morning. - Good morning. - What are you doing? - Drawing. You catch bad guys with Mom? Yes. Here, I present Angel Carmini. Former commander in the defunct regional investigation and coordination. Fired ten years ago for arms trafficking. Precision shooter and ballistic expert. I know him from Internal Affairs. He was one to use homemade expansion bullets in the service. - Is he involved in armed robbery? - Suspected never convicted. If we prove Carmini's participation in these attacks... he risks getting life. With good luck and some good pressure... ...and for a reduced sentence, he'll give us his accomplices. - Questions? - No. Good, we take him tomorrow at dawn. How are you, buddy? Here, it jammed twice in the field. It's suppose to be new. - Is that all? - No! The evening of the car-jacking... You called me and I didn't answer, now you ignore my messages. Why? Are you angry? No, my mind is just elsewhere at this time. Vincent. If you can identify the guys, I'll take care of them. It's all OK ... It's OK. You kept this picture of us? It was a tough time for me. Was removed from elite force and transferred to a desk at the Academy. - Because of what? - I made a big mistake as captain. What kind of mistake? The kind that could've gotten me behind bars or in a coffin. - How did you get out of it? - I turned it into an opportunity. I was ingenious. I ended up a Commander. Everyone was happy, except for Christian. There was no evidence, but he harassed me. They sent me away so he'd forget it. When I returned to anti-gang Christian had calmed down. Why? They promised him a promotion, Commander of BRB. It just shows... that everyone has a price. Everyone. Vincent... You're a good person. Mistakes can be corrected but you must pay the price. Well... If you need me, you know where to find me. Later on! Police! Don't move! Down on your knees! Thank you, gentlemen. - What do you want? - You know why we're here. Of course he knows. Right Angel? Start the search. Vincent, did you search that room? Uh, no. Where were you on April 12 and the night of April 16 and 17? You participated in the Suresnes robbery and in the attack in Sartrouville. You killed nine men. We know you're behind it. I'm sure Denard is part too. Commander, we're here for Denard? You have no evidence. Are they the same? Take him. Isa? Shit! Joseph, call for help. Look at me. Breathe slowly. Isa ... Fuck! Forgive me, Isa. Forgive me. The investigation must continue. Carmini made the cartridges. We must have his accomplices. Luc Denard and Anti-gang boys. Again? They were close. When his unit dissolved, his people joined Denard. All cases that Carmini was suspect went to anti-gang and closed without followup. Courage. - Thank you. - Condolences, Christian. - You're going to pay for this. - I have nothing to do with it. As if you had nothing to do with Carmini's robberies. - That case is closed. - Really? No matter how long it takes, I'll get you eventually. If the kid was on my team she would still be alive. - Stop! - Be quiet. Luc, stop it. Good... Good... We are gathered here to provide our respect for Captain Isabelle Lefranc. An exceptional woman. A wife... A mother, a sister and a friend. - Fuck, I can't stop... - An irreplaceable life... - that ended too soon... - I can't be quiet. I can't... - Stop, Christian! - In Sartrouville he left nine dead bodies! - Stop, Christian! - Huh? - Stop, Christian! He comes strutting around ... huh? - Does nothing ... no principles! - Hold up. Work in the anti-gang unit and get immunity to the end! He's an assassin, he is one... pay for your crimes ... huh! I'll kill you! I'll make you pay! - He never stops. - Stop, Luc! - Whoa, whoa, whoa... Show a little respect for the family. Shame on you ... Have you no shame? She was my family! Worth ten times as much as you! What family? You die alone! You have no friends or family! Keep looking up! You have to pay for her death! - You don't need me anymore? - No. Thanks for helping to get that motherfucker. I won't help with getting Denard. If you refuse, Isa died for nothing. Getting Luc, won't bring her back. You have a soft spot for Denard, right? I learned more in one year with him, than 15 with you. That's what you think. It's Ricaud. We need weapons. We must replenish inventory, and I need all the original requisitions. I'll take care of it. Fucking Chavez. I have nothing to do with it, but he won't let it go. I'm hungry. (Shouting in Arabic) - You deal with it? - We can take it. - What did they use? - Regular 5.56. - Do we know who it was? - It was you. What does that mean? You accused Denard of robbing go-fast...in front of everyone. Arabic telephone did the rest. Looks like Malik Al Sadr's method. That's what happens to those who attack his network... ...you get the picture? Denard's team is here. You better brace yourself. Chavez, motherfucker! - You killed him! - Guys... It's your fault! - Yes, hello? - I won't be long. You put a trap for Carmini... to what and why? - What is this? - Listen carefully. You belong to me. Understand? So, no initiatives. You're crazy, I'll turn myself in to Christian. The more you talk, won't make more or less corpses. And this time, I won't be there to clean up. My 'Request for Transfer'. I want you to sign it. I'll return to the armory. I've got no more to do here. What is it? Take a look at this... A friend at Interpol sent me this info. There's no chance Carmini participated in the attacks in Suresnes and Sartrouville since he was seen in Spain. Carmini wasn't there, so... Luc Denard wasn't involved. I was wrong. What were the cartridges doing at his house? There is very little time to find who fucked us. A banknote from the attack at Suresnes surfaced. Good timing. You stay where you are, we're not finished here. The Derkaoui brothers. Tarek and Kais. They paid with a banknote from the attack of Suresnes. Amateurs ... Former Special Forces Group. Elite military - Algerian. - Now they rob drugs and banks. - Ties to Carmini or anti-gang? No...not that I know, my contact can tell us more. Vincent. If things go wrong, don't hesitate to shoot. OK. That's him. He killed Carmini. You know them? Yes, Derkaoui brothers. True psychopaths. Do you know where they live? Anything for me? A hideout, it's new. They're flush with heroin and MDMA. MDMA? It's for little girls. I want something more. What? Approach. I get a delivery in three days. Make sure I'm not bothered... ...and that it all goes smoothly. - I'll do what I can. The Derkaoui's have several hideouts... I recommend that you check- 215 Rue Colbert, in Clichy. I hope you're right. The Derkaoui's are heavy-weight. If I was in your place, I'd take ninja's. I don't want to lose you. - Why one can know? - Don't count us for a ride. - Oh yeah. You know what they call the shooter's in BAC? - What? - Skulls. - The Skulls? Forget anti-terrorist group they support anti-gang unit. - We need a break, let's drop it. - No, I don't give up. - Without the anti-terrorist group? - We do it ourselves. I hope you're joking. With a marksman and rubber bullets we can surprise them. - We need them alive. - It's suicide, we won't make it. You no, Vincent yes. I know what he's capable of. You're in the apartment, we're in the hallway. You flush them out, we cover the exits. - Sound right? - Hmm. - Well? - We lost Isabelle... ... isn't that enough? Do you have a better idea? - Then shut up. - What are you doing? - And you say nothing? - I can do it. Can't you see it's suicide? He's gone over the line. He won't stop. He'll get you killed, with his madness. As if he can stop the earth and save the world. 15 years I've been with him. You think he asks how I feel? But he asks you? - Leave it alone. - I swear... Christian is my friend. I'd give my right arm for him. But this is too much. He's been occupied by Denard for years. It eats him up. You saw him at the funeral. You can still refuse. It will be an hour, before he comes with authorization. Do you know him? No, but I thought. - Here, rubber-bullet gun. It's utter madness. - And if it goes wrong? - Don't worry about me. Police! Drop your weapons! Don't shoot! We surrender! Vincent, it's good. They surrendered. You did fine, don't worry. Come on, get up. Banknotes are from Suresnes job. The numbers correspond. Nicolas confirms the drugs are from Malik Al Sadr's network. What? It's Ricaud... I know why you avoid me. It's you who stole the guns, but you were not careful enough. Out of respect for Chavez, you get a choice. You can turn yourself in to me, or I send the federal police. - He released them? - I'll come. I have the money and the drugs! I don't give a damn! What do you mean by "classified"? Are you kidding me? The Chief Constable has ordered them released. He's gone to fix it with him. Christian! Move...get the hell out! What's with you? - Listen to me! - Move! It's fucking serious. Get out, it's serious! What is it? Huh? - What's wrong with you? - It's all my fault. - What are you talking about? - Isa and all... - Isa what? Her death, the Derkaoui's, all that happened... What are you saying? - It's all my fault. - No, what's going on? Come here. What are you talking about? Calm, breathe. It's my fault...Luc's death and all the others, it's my fault. - It's all my fault. - What are you talking about? Here, join. Sit in the car. What have you done? I take charge of it all. I dare not tell you, because... - I will do what he asks. - No. You do as I say. By order of the Commissioner, I am classifying this case... ...then Milo, we go after him together. This case will stay between us. Had I been closer to you, this never would've happened. I'm sorry, Vincent. Forgive me. Christian ... Christian ... Fuck! Where are the Derkaoui's ? Where? - Give me an address! - Fuck you! Give me their address! Now! - It must be now! - It's OK OK, OK. I'm protected. I'm protected. Come here! Don't move! Shut up! Shut up! Look at me. The guy this morning, Milo. What do you know about him? - What do you know? - Fuck you! What do you know about him? What do you know? What do you know, you dirty shit! What? - Speak! - I gave him a tip about Sartrouville. - Where is he? - Stop, I'll tell you. No, No, No, don't do it! You compromised the mission. You killed a Police Commander. - He had tracked us. Why so hard? The kid is no longer a priority. - You lost control and it's not the first time. A few more days, then he is ready. Milo, you failed. Drop it. That's an order. Listen, I'll manage I'll manage! Alright? Trust me. Who are you motherfucker? Who? Did you kill Chavez? I told you - shut up. Stand up. You don't get it, do you? I made you a war-machine. Join me, You can not return. Look at me. FIVE MONTHS LATER FRESNES PRISON Miles. Get dressed. Mr. Miles Please sit down. You are serving a life sentence. This is a presidential pardon. It can take effect immediately. I command a special unit attached to the French army. Our mission is to operate outside the legal system. Officially we don't exist. To wipe out terrorism, we use methods... ...our government can not condone publicly. Recovered money from Suresnes robbers... ...provided funds necessary to finance the group. Attack at Go-fast was our first mission. We had to destroy a network... ...that financially supported international terrorism. I've had my eye on you since the competition. I was hoping that Milo could convince you to join us. But after he proposed buying your explosive cartridges... ...probably too quick, you severed all contact. Milo was given carte blanche to make you change your mind. But he went too far, and I am sorry. Join us ... and you are free. I want you under my command, Vincent.
