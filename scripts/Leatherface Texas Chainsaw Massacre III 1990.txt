A special forensic team under direction of the county coroner has been helicoptered to the site to dig out the mass grave and to try to determine the victims' cause of death. We'll bring you more details... Stop hiding underneath those things. Ryan. What? Radio reception's shit. So's our conversation. You should be washed in the blood... If we beat this thing to death, we're going to get mad, right? I don't want to fight anymore, okay? Me neither. What's the point? Once we get to Florida, you're off to New York, then it's Air Britannia all the way, right? We're over if we fight, we're over if we don't fight. I just need some time on my own, okay? I wanted you on this trip so we could enjoy each other, we could talk. You mean talk or tiptoe around the real issue with chit-chat? Now you sound exactly like my father. Great. Hey, turn it up. We're getting something. ...checkpoint at the site of the mass grave has caused the first-ever traffic jam in the history of the interstate. So if you're a curious motorist, be ready to prove you're not a killer, or you have to spend the night with a bunch of dead people. Stay tuned... Could be worse. At least we're not as bad off as the people in that body pit. - They were murdered. - Mmm. My God, they had to have been. They didn't jump in with big grins and bathing suits. They ought to fry that sucker if the find him. Violence is no answer to violence. Welcome to the real world, Michelle. One of these days, you're gonna have to live in it, no matter where you run. Welcome to the red light district. Are there people in those bags? Jeez, looks like we've died and gone to hell. ...as soon as we get the details... Let's not stick around to meet any of them. Get your ass down here. Make sure you're zipped up tight... The coroner says they're all toxic. Roger, I'm coming down. Wouldn't want to miss all the poison pigshit. Oh, shit. We got more over here, Scotty. Well, fuck me running. Flash it before you dig it out, okay? Yeah, right. Be careful of that crap. Blood poisoning. Yeah. Gas gangrene, the coroner said, just from touching this shit. Oh God. Oh man, I think I'm going to barf. Not in front of those news assholes. Far side of those trees. Should've listened to my old man and went into real estate. Looks like a pretty advanced stage of decomposition. It's like those body pits we found up near Dong Tre. Just counting skulls, I'd say we got 40 or 50 bodies here. Jesus. Oh, man. This is fucked. 60 or 70 bodies, yes. It seems that when corpses lay around like this for long periods of time under conditions like these, they putrefy into a substance called a dip... Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, we seem to be experiencing... Adipocere, you idiot. You would know that, Mr. Pre-med. Creamy breakdown of body fat. Basically, if you're buried right, your skin turns into poison Crisco. I want to get out of here. Uh-huh. We'll get out of here soon. Here comes ole deputy dog. Coming from? - L.A. - Going to? Deland, Florida. Something wrong with the airlines? No, I'm delivering this car to my father. Do you want to see the papers? No, that's okay, ma'am. Just hurry along. What happened here anyway? None of your business, son. Just move along and keep moving. Don't stop for nothing or nobody. Okay. - Didn't wanna be on TV anyway. - Ryan, please. Now what's bothering you, Michelle? I just want to get this trip over with. If I drive all night, I can. Do you think whoever did that is still around? Nah, whoever did that is long gone. Sounded like the bodies were pretty de composed, too. - You see, what happens is... - Ryan, please. Spare me the postmortems. Looks like we're about here. - Where? - The middle of nowhere. Aah! Oh my God. We can't just leave him here. I'll take care of it. - No, no. - Michelle. No, it's my fault. I'll do it. I'm sorry, little guy. Ryan... I can't do it. Give it to me. - Thanks for the ride, mister. - Sure. - You drive real careful now. - You bet. Que pasa? Looks like we got some customers, ladies. You stay right here. You first. See if the bathroom's safe for human use. Dream on. - You okay? - Yeah. Hi. I got ya. I got ya good. Five bucks. It's only five bucks. It's a good picture. What do you say? 3.69 just for you. Give ya... 3.69. No, we're in a hurry. Could you just fill it up, please? You're in a big hurry, huh? I'm gonna service you real good, ma'am. Don't you worry about it. Little California Daddy's girl, huh? Bitch says fill up. I'll fill it up for you, mascara face. Make you moan. Make you moan real good. You're gonna like it. Mm-hmm. You like me, don't you? What's the matter, shortcakes? Don't you get uppity on me. It's all right, ma'am. You ain't giving the lady a hard time now, are you? I ain't bothering nobody, mister. Uh-huh. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. He's a little touched. Been that way ever since he lost his... ...job over at the old slaughterhouse. Sort of the town loony, you might say. Well, looks like you had yourself a little mishap here. We hit a little animal on the road. Oh? Who's we? A friend and I. We, uh... I killed it. Well, I wouldn't worry about that. There's road kill all over Texas. Natural order of things. Besides... If you were the last thing I saw before I died, I'd die a happy man. Don't you ever do that to me, bitch. - Who's this? - Hi. You can call me Tex. Yippee-yi-ay. Listen, I'd be glad to buy you both a beer... whatever you need, if I can... ...catch a ride as far as Ronesdale. Sorry, Tex. We're on a pretty tight schedule today. That right? You in a big hurry? Well, we could discuss it, I guess. Okay. I got to go to the bathroom. Is it over there? Yeah, change your life. Real nice car you have here. Thanks. You know, if you are headed to Houston, that road over there is the quickest way. It's a straight shot on the highway. Well, it used to be, but this new road here is a hell of a lot quicker. You got a map? Yeah, I got a map. I'll show you. Okay. Jesus. See? Yeah, I see. See? "1973." That road over there ought to be right there. Ain't even on this map. What's the damn difference? The distance looks the same. The difference is it ain't a good idea to be messing around these back roads at night when... ...you don't know where you're going. Look, man... I'm just trying to get home. Yeah, I understand you're trying to get home, but listen to me... we can't help you, okay? I'm sorry. Where'd that little weasel get to? God damn! What the fuck do you think you're doing? Get your hands off! I'm telling you, I didn't know! Get the fuck out of here! Let's go, you shit heap! Skinny son of a bitch! I was only looking at her! She liked it fine! Just ask her! Why don't you just shut up, stupid? You shut up, motherfucker. This is my place! I'll do whatever I want here in my place! What's wrong? He's having himself a peek-a-boo party with you as the star. I think I'm going to puke. Folks, I think you better get in your car. - What's wrong? - Go! Go! He's got a gun. Get the hell out of here! God's gift, huh? Start the car! ...god damn it. You're too good for me, huh? You're too good for me?! - I'll take you down right here. - Go, go, go! Come on! You heifer-butt, I'm gonna fuck you in hell! You wanna fuck me, baby, I know you do! First time you saw me you liked me. Kind of guy I am! Jesus Christ! - Holy fuck, he dusted him! - What happened? Dusted who? The cowboy! He shot the cowboy! What?! Go! Drive faster! Go! We got to find the cops. That town. What if there isn't any town? Just drive. - Drive, drive! - Where? Where? Take the cowboy's route. - What are you talking about? - Turn right! Go, go, go! It's Armageddon, bitch face! It's Armageddon, you bitch! Goddamn it. Trap is sprung now, honey. Thought there was a town around here. That's what he told me. Would you just slow down? I'm not stopping until we find somebody. We're going to find somebody. We're far away from that guy. He's not going to get us. Would you turn it off?! Shit! - Calm down! It's a tire tread! - Stop yelling at me! If you would just listen to me. Shh! Listen. Hear that? Yeah. - Where's it coming from? - I don't know. - Oh my God. - It's coming from behind us. Fuck! He's gaining on us! - Who is it? - I don't know. Oh my God! What do they want from us? Oh my God! - We hit another one. - No, it hit us. He threw it at us. Where the fuck are they? We blew a tire. Why are they doing this to us? - Ryan. - This is not happening. It's happening! It's happening to us. We got to change this tire and get out of here now. Okay. Slow and easy... 'cause I'm about to fuckin' lose my mind! Get out the jack, please. I'll take care of him. Come on. Get the light. That goes this way. Let me help you. We got to move it. I got to put in a couple lug nuts. Did you hear that? Hurry up. I think that truck is coming back. Doesn't sound like a truck to me. No, it doesn't. Michelle, I could use a little light down here, please. Finish it, Ryan. Finish it now. - Michelle. - I'm serious. - Hurry up, Ryan. - Almost there. Michelle... I need the light. - I mean it. - Almost there. It's done? It's going to have to do. Let's hit it. Run, Ryan! - Get in! - It's locked! It's locked! Get in the car! Go, go! Go, go, go! It won't go into gear! Aah! Go! Get out of here! We hit him! We hit him! He's coming up the back! Go! Yes! What happened? Did we lose him? He cut our trunk. Jesus. We have to pull over so I can fix the lug nuts. I'm not stopping. I got to finish tightening them. We're going to lose a tire. You have to pull over so I can fix it. I'm not stopping. Listen to me, I am not taking any more chances. Now you pull this car over so I can fix the goddamn tire! All right. Jesus! Damn it. Totaled. Oh, Je... Jesus. - Aah! - Take it easy! Take it easy. You're going to be okay. Take it easy. We got to get her out. Please help me get her out. I'll get her out. You just get away from the car. Get away from the car. We got to keep moving. We can't stick around here. Pal... You can't even stand around right now. You just take care. There's some people after us... A guy with a chainsaw. - You saw what? - A chainsaw. Listen, I don't want you to move right now. Sounds like you're just a few quarts... shy of a full tank, you know what I mean? Hold still. Hold still. There's a bunch of guys. And they have guns, too. Yeah, I know, and chainsaws. Militant lumberjacks... I see them all the time. Here, I want you to take one of these. I can't believe it. I been going up in the hills every weekend for two years. I never even seen another car on that road. I got a survival camp with a few buddies of mine. Trying to keep in training for... ...the big blowup, know what I mean? Do you hear what I'm saying, man? We're being hunted! Hunted? Yeah, right. I hear you, man. Ryan. Okay, take it easy. Take it easy. You're all right. Most of this stuff looks superficial. Just sit up. There we go. Okay. Here, I want you to take one of these. Okay? A little water. Tex... he's still up there. Who? Who are you? - My name's Benny. - Ow. I'm the sorry-ass bastard you almost hit. We got to move. They might find us. - You people are serious. - Mister, do you see this? How many? We don't know. Two, maybe more. One's on foot, and he's got... that. That's an awfully big saw. Tex... did you see him up there? No, I couldn't see nothing except your headlights. He could still be up there. We got to go check on him. Wait a minute. What did you give us?! Painkillers. Might make you a little sleepy. What? Are you nuts? - We have got to move. - Now, just hold it. Hold it. I can handle this. I'm prepared for this kind of thing. Now you guys just relax, and I'll go find your friend. No, man. They're out there. Look, pal, it doesn't make it any different from anywhere else. Now, I'll go get some goodies out of the jeep and find your buddy. Stay put, okay? - Wait. - Wait a minute. Just sit down before you fall down. Looks like you had a little mishap. Hey, mister, I'm glad you came along. My jeep and this car, we had a... You had an accident. Already know that. Michelle. Michelle, come on, we got to get out of here. No. We got to... So pretty. So beautiful, the glow. Technology's your friend, you know? Yeah, right. Listen, mister, I got some people hurt down here, and I need your help. We got the means. We got the machines. Look, buddy, I need you to help me turn my jeep up. You mean upright? Yeah, right side up. What do you think all these fucking flares are for, stupid? Yeah. Thanks a lot, buddy. Just a second. I got to get something. Well, rocket, brother. Ho, now. You ready to roll, young woman? Just 15 seconds. Almost home, Lucille. Push comes to shove. Damn! Jesus! Hey, scumbag! Here! You want me, not him! Ohh. - Michelle. - Hmm? I can hear him. We got to get out of here. How long have we been out? I don't know. We have to metabolize this shit out of our system, or we're going to be down for the rest of the night. We got to find the road... or a house or something. Anyplace is better than here. We're sitting ducks out here. Where's the goddamn sunrise? This is going to have to do for now. Come on. I can't hear him anymore. Who the hell are you? What the hell's going on? What's going on?! Hey, girl, I need some questions answered, and I need them answered right now. Do you understand me?! Hey. Oh god. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were hurt that bad. The party's still cooking. They're still out there. You some kind of soldier or what? Just on the weekends. Wrong weapon, wrong war. They got us a week ago. I'm the only one left. Me and my sister. Sisters. We go together. Week, maybe five days ago. A week? What the hell are you still doing here? Keep your voice down! They watch the road. They hunt people. They really hunt them. They trap them and they kill them. I haven't been able to get out of the woods. We just stopped to help this guy. We thought he'd been run over. Day before yesterday, I had to eat a fucking rat raw... and some berries that tasted... tasted like they'd been thrown up once already. It's just... I mean... it... Thanks for what you did. Thanks. Where is the road? I don't know. I heard some noises. Maybe it's that guy Benny. Nah, he took off a long time ago. Who knows how long we were out. - Benny! - Shh! Thanks. Benny! - I got to go. - They'll be dead soon. Maybe I can bring the bad guys out in the light. You coming? All right, you stay here. Don't move. I'll be right back. Hold up. Keep it. Thanks. Eee! Nice neighborhood. Damn. - Come on. - Aah! Aah! Oh my God. Ryan. Ryan! Go! Get the fuck out of here! Fuck! No! God! Please, no! Ohh! Hello? Hello? Hello?! Wait, wait. Hey. It's all right. It's all right. I'm not going to hurt you. What's your name? This is Sally. Owww! Yakkety-yak, don't talk back. Girls, sorry to butt in, but looks like you had yours elf another little mishap. You know, you're late. Hmm? Boy, the y just get dumber and dumber. Don't they? No! I ain't no runt of the litter, and I'll prove it to you one day. What, you think I'm some sort of a piece of shit? There's gonna come a time when you're going to find out just what kind of human being I am. I'm a human being. Bone patrol for stupid fuckface, eh? I'll show you motherfuckers. That's the way it is. Aah! So... how you like Texas? More little nails if you don't stay put. Why are you doing this? Be cause if you don't poke 'em, then they don't leak. And if they don't leak, we can't feed Grandpa. Silly. Ruckus, ruckus. My nap is just a goner. I certainly hope you children are pleased with yourselves. Where's Junior? He's mopping up, Mama. That's what you always say. Mopping up, which means you ain't caught 'em all yet, just like last time. Please. What have we done? Can't you stop this? You best shut on up, or I'll do your tongue first. That's right. Best not to get Mama's dander up. Brought home the bacon, Mama. Come on, Tex. Give me a hand here. Pull him around. Get that trap off. Fancy sneakers. All right now... Okay, don't bruise him. Pretty good size one, ain't he? Yeah, he's a keeper. We got some dark meat coming in, too, Mama. Junior'll be trotting it in any minute. If he minds. Junior's been getting out of hand lately, but I got a present for him. I got a fine present, going to keep him in line, yes, sir. He liked that last present you got him... that electronic thingumajig. Of course he did. That's progress, boy. Technology is our friend. He might even learn something. Ain't that right, Mama? What do you think of our little lady? Uncertain. She looks to me like she might go all screamy on us, Eddie. I wish you'd call me Tex. I told you. Oh, I'm sorry, boy. God damn it, I'm sorry. Say, how'd you like to do us the honor of plugging that whore up? Yes, sir. Hey, Tink, this one's still kicking. Yippee-yi-ay. Well, I'm going to go get Junior's present.
