"The back of the body was under the water..." "...was swaying..." "... one of which was... " "...around me..." "With the double whirl... "...the attack began." "The double whirl..." "fixed my body tightly ." Lay it down onto the wall. Then the table. I really don't want to sell it. But I have to .It's the engine. There is the rudder. Then spill the net. Are you happy? It is because we bought the boat or have a house? For both. Give the boat name after mine. It's okey, though it's unfortune in the legend. Read it for me. The soul has come to me from your body." What will the two people with insufficient love do? "Anyhow, there will be a breakthrough for two people." "The destiny will be the same no matter who goes behind."

Help yourself. Habil will also come. He is not good at... being the partner. Go and take some food please! How do you feel? It's boring. Why? No matter what this is... ...it's dangerous. Just at the beginning... ...but after once you will not be afraid. Stroke it! What's his name? Molken. What does he eat? Meat is his favourite. It is lovely now,but will be dangerous when grown up. In US it's loved by many people. He likes the fierce animals so the crocodile takes the place of wolfhound. It can be the feather of leather-shoe in good quality. He is fully against maltreating the animals. Will it grow bigger? Yes, that's scared. I feel terrified. I't about 2 meters long. ...and the maxilal is more than 50 centimeterl long. It's talking to you, madam... who is friend of the crocotale. This is the Mississipi crocotale in the tropics... ...where there is also American crocotales. Martina! Come here. I'll guide you to my house. My husband will look after me. You can see it at once. Is this the indoor swimming pool? For the whole year it's 26 degrees. It's quiet warm. Do you like it? Sure, it's convenient to swim at any time. Come on ,to the first floor. This is my room. If that teacher didn't appear, you would definitely be here. Unfortunately he did appear. Kiss me, just once. Please! How repulsive, keep off me at once! Are you ok? It's you that made the fault. Are you really happy? Yes. Is this the purpose to entertain me? If he had such plan, I would recruit him as the accoutant. He's not good at mathematics. Then what do you appreciate? Is there anything good in the man who can't earn enough money? Just tell some tales? I want to go back. It's an uneasy evening. Go back! That's beautiful. Who? The lady in red evening clothes. Have a nice sleep... and go fishing tomorrow morning. Do you love me? The tuna here... ...proves my love. No , I want the fried potato. Martina. Wait! Martina  To console the people who have endured the sad days... ...and to give Ullises a forever sleep. "From the peaceful seabed..." "...arose two snakes,..." "...twisting the giant skeleton..." "...over onto the wave,..." "...and threw out the chest, raised the head ,emerged." "The back of the body was swaying under the water..." "Perish the present time..." "and don't think about tomorrow." With ice? Yes, put some in it. It's too hot, let's go swimming. I love you. Tell him that we cannot wait. Make the deal with the German. Ok. Dad, let's play the coin game, shall we? Wait a moment, We can do that. Mom ,look ! Papa, throw it. Yes. I have got 7coins. That's great, Yabil, change your colthes quickly. Go back to the pool. Have you got it? You bitch, get back! Quickly. It's irritating to sweep your pool. Get back! Mom, the gardener bullies the crockdail. What's up? He regards Molken the bitch. I haven't touched the crocodale, just swept the pool. You are lying. I'm telling the true. It's your phone call. Hello, Who is that? Yabil. What's the chance to win in the judgement? Very slim. The regulation for the area near the sea is restricted. I can't understand that. Who will be annoyed if we add some stories with actually nothing in it? It's rather troublesome, so reduce 2 stories. Sorry, we can't settle this. Luis? Who is that? Say something please. Dammed. "Perish the present time..." "don't think too much about the stuff for tomorrow." When I cross the sea in the world , in the end I find out... ...that I need you. Who has made the phone call? Hello, who is that? Who has called? Already hung up. It's... What's up? I'm a little bit tired. Come on, relax. I am really exhausted. Come on! Which problem annoies you? Martina. When I cross the sea in the world , in the end I find out... ...that I need you. Albert! Albert! He is out. I live in the Proletariat Hotel... ...Room 35, drop in if you want to see me. Thank you. Who is that? It's from the beauty parlour ,the reservation table has been changed. How about the dinner? I won't come back, I have fixed an appointment already. Then, see you evening. Are you ok? Is there anything annoying you? This is the tuna. You are malicious. Why? Why do you come back? Tell me the reason. I need you. I need you to help me. What can I do?I have had my husband and son. I want to see my son. I married with Sierr... ...and Yabil knows nothing about it. In his mind, Sierr is his father. What fucking did I do? I am not interested... ...and don't want to know... ...but one thing. Tell me, Did you escape with that lady in red evening clothes? Answer it. After I went fishing... I got on her hovercraft, then my boat floated far away. It was lost. Where have you gone? That's Sumatra. Let's go there together if we have time. Sumatra? I won't go anywhere... with the unexisted people. What do you mean? You are dead. It's clear, isn't it? Dad has foung with Sierr... ...that you were killed. Say something that I love to hear. " From the peaceful sea bed..." "...arose two snakes,..." "...over onto the wave..." "...and threw out the chest, raised the head ,emerged." "The back of the body was swaying under the water..." "...one of which was arroud me..." "...swirling twice towards me..." "...and with the double whirl..." ...fixed my body tightly." "I tried all the way to untie it ." I am not coming back. You cant do that. Martina... ...go back. The ball decelerates due to the grass. Great, the nearest so far. Ok. I am coming back. This time you are a little anxious. Welcome. Please put the cases... ...in the back of the car. Come on . It's terrible to be seen by other people. My feet were hurt. Let's take the steps. Which floor? The top one. It's safe there. Nobody lives here? No, since it's not sold yet. The last judgement hasn't been given yet. It is said that 2 storeis have to be reduced due to the disobeying the law. Come on , have a rest here. Please tell everyone... that I am back. Are you serious? You should stay here for some day and think it over. It's a wonderful room. Everything that needed has already been prepared. Don't roll up the shutters. "From the peaceful seabed..." "...arose two snakes..." "...twisting the giant skeleton..." Yeah! "...over onto the wave,..." "...and threw out the chest, raised the head ,emerged." "The back of the body under the water..." How do you feel? "...was swaying... " Can you feel it? "...one of which was arroud me..." "...swirling towards me..." "...and with the double whirl... Ok, I got to leave. "...tried all the way to untie it." "From the peaceful seabed..." "...arose two snakes,..." "...twisting the giant skeleton..." Yeah! Yeah ! "...over onto the wave,..." Ok? "...and threw out the chest, raised the head ,emerged." Do it again. "The back of the body was swaying under the water..." Again. "...one of which was arroud me..." "...swirling towards me..." Look , for the second time. "...and with the double whirl... see, still again. ...fixed your body tightly." Come on! Do you want some water? No, thanks.I drink too much in the company. Are you busy today? The same as usual. What about you? I will go to my office. Then, I will leave now. Wait a moment. I still want to hear you so... I have to go back. Stay with me, will you? Please, do not go back. It's impossilbe... ...to stay here. Stay with me. The travel agent from GB wants to buy the house. Are you planing to sell it, aren't you? Will you sell it? It seems as if the parlament compromises. Let's go to England tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes. The flight takes off at 10 am. What about your office? With pleasure. I go to work every day. Martina! Ullises I'm really sorry. Is it bad news? We will fly to England tomorrow... ...to sell the house. There will be some trouble if you don't leave. "About..." "...1000 years ago,..." "there was a princess who fell in love with a passenger..." "...who came along from an unknown kindom to her territory." "The princess was afraid of losing her lover,..." "so she imprison him in the underground room of the city." "Every day, the princess came to the room to absorb the love from the passenger." "There was no window or door in the room..." "...so the only way to escape was..." "...to love heart and soul the princess as the goddess." What about me? I can't keep lovnig the princess any more. It's mpossible here. Move out. Come on, Let's go together. Dad, glad to see you. It's rather early. Your cell phone... is power off. Yabil. He is playing the coin game. Give me a kiss. Ok, bring it to me. What do you want to drink? No, thanks. I want to. Have you been out? Yes, I fetch Yabil after I have done the business. Why are you going to FRancia? I have been there just for a while. There was a man in your car. You have definitely mistaken. There are many same cars in the street. Ok. Parker. Did you sweep the swimming pool? Yes, I have cleaned it. Great, It's bright here. What's this, something dirty? My husband saw me come to Francia. So if I don't leave early... Don't mention my hiding here. Have you seen the same man? Let's go! I will come this evening. Do not leave here till then. I don't want to seperate again. I don't want to hide ,either. Have you changed your mind? Albert! The car is out of oil, and I can't wait them to fill in the car. With Ullises? I went to Francia. Don't treat me! Listen to me! It's better to kill you rather than losing you. I want to go out. Go! Sierr! Go out at once! Yabil! If mom doesn't go... I love you so much. Hello. Who is that? Sierr wants to talk with you. With me? Yes.He is waiting in the beach. He is there. I didn't expext your coming back. It seemed that I was imcompetent. No. I paid the fee for the funeral. You are already dead. Tell Martina... ...that she has no choice. Come back with me? Or die? Let her make the dicision. You son of bitch. Come back?Or die?Let her choose? Where have you gone? Martina! What's that? Come here to see the engine. "From the peaceful seabed arose two snakes," "they threw out the chest, raised the head ,emerged." What's up? The engine doesn't work. "One of the snakes is around me, swirling the whirl towards me..." ...fixed my body tightly." Martina! Whats the matter? No, go and take more towels. Ullises, quickly! We can't stop it. What's the matter here? Come here. Hold the rope! I can't move. Look out! Ullises! Don't leave! Cling to me! Oh, I can't hold you! I don't want to die! Dammed, I don't want to die. Ullises. The soul has come to me from your body." What will the two people with insufficient love do? "Anyhow, there will be a breakthrough for two people." "The destiny will be the same no matter who goes behind." "The travellers know that you can't make the same trip twice." Martina! Cross the sea in the world to find out that... ...I need you.
