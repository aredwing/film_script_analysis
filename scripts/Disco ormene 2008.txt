I found that our studies needed a boost... a stimulus, right? I am tired of its "new impetus". But they are just musicians. It is a quiet and peaceful. Let me hear you! Rock'n'Roll! You rock! Salt water with ice. And one for the guitar. Now I see who plays guitar. What? Sorry, guys. Lead guitarist! The main. Cool. Because I am assembling a band... and I already have some big names.

Would not do with the old Guitar Dad, would you? Yes, I would. Barry wants disc and nothing but hard disk. You said lead guitar or air guitar? I must have forgotten...

On second thought, you do not have any instrument. - Titus, hurry up. - Yes.. Now! It is the destiny or not? I just got 500 bucks my first salary. It is only with a stick. So what? We can turn with something a little less fancy. Hey, brain of land, whether reach the top ten or what? Or want to bury for good? That worm sucker. Need to tell you one thing. Yes? There is one last thing I need in the first test. - A bass player. - E? Know what's inside. Talent. I feel it! Somewhere in there There is a big star of the disc! You know, deep down. - Barry? Look at me! - What? I do not look like a star of the disc. Yeah, I think so. You know? I think not. I think I look like a fat earthworm, stupid, slimy, talentless. But, Tito... you just have big bones! Barry... Earthworms have no bones. No, sure, but still... You may be blessed with bold ideas, different... and personality but some of us... we are not. Ah, Tito! This is a lame excuse! Just start playing and will forget everything about these little... tires you have. Unfortunately, my tires and I... we have a test-run for which we have to study. Come on, just once. It is temporary, only a test. I swear. - Please... - Please... not that look! Remember that I'm helping him prepare for the test! Tito! I beg you. If you touch this time never going to ask you a favor. Never again? Never. I swear... sincerely. - Right. But just this once. - Yes! Thanks, Tito!

It's a historic day! Can you feel? It's the sound of fame, victory in the contest... and 10 grand, also worth mentioning. Now you, Tito. Yes.. no! Tito... Tito. This... I thought you... Tito. You worried me there. Jimmy, I hear his guitar. We will win the contest! That's it! My love is always dancing And not a bad thing not lie We spent the night in Frisco In any type of disc My goodness! that night I gave goodbye to our love Do not blame the sun Do not blame the moonlight Do not blame the good times Dance, dance, dance Do not blame the sun Do not blame the moonlight Do not blame the good times Dance, dance, dance There was too much?

The sound was certainly a joke. - Move away from the battery. - Yeah, sure. This is called? Set the pace? Have you heard that? - Titus. - Yes! This low is all wrong. Loosen the belt and tighten cortas. But you can not loose more. That's better. Jimmy. If I say "Funky" you say... - "6-6-6." The number of... - No. Oh, sorry. Gloria, wait until the chorus before starting to scream. - And Barry... - Yes? You're fired... as a drummer. Will to focus on the keyboard. - Yes, this is my face. - Now!

No blame Sunshine Do not blame the moonlight Do not blame the good times Blame dance Do not blame the sun Do not blame the moonlight Do not blame the good times Blame dance I can not I can not can not control my feet I can not I can not can not control my feet I feel that deep down you're a lonely woman... who needs a man to pick you up. I mean, look after you. But Tony is not here through the desert? There is space here. Space all the passions and feelings! C'mon, cheer up! They think it is a school band Must be those ridiculous earthworms that entered my musical competition. Have you heard something? No. But they are great! Not as good as you, Tony. Just because they are stylish, dance and they are young... I mean, you're not old! Well, I promised to show you the inside of my car... Sunshine! Moonlight Good times Dance Sunshine Moonlight Good times. I knew it. I knew that we were able! I knew all the time. One wonders, it seemed more... a bank of earthworms playing together for the first time. Tito! When the lights of the disco shine on our clothes... nobody will notice. Not a worm. We will win the contest! Certainly. Nothing can stop us. - Barry... - Nothing. I will not have to go on stage... is not it? Not? Especially now that got my new diet. "I Find Your Slim!" I just need to stay away from the earth... This was the best night of my life. Thank you, thank you! Sure... well, anything... You can let go now. Hello! Let's see what he says. "Dear Barry Sunscreen. For your registration for our contest... regret to inform you that... you were not selected? Lisa, provide for I'm not disturbed... - What? - I want my spot back! - Who do you think you are? - Sunshine Barry! Hey, Sunscreem Barry. This is a musical competition seriously. The public would laugh if I let earthworms to compete. They will not even realize! The name of you is not "Barry and the Band of Worms?" - No, do not flock... band! - E? Listen! Do not that sound of worms or anything. We are much more so... No blame Sunshine Understand? Everyone will think we are centipedes. Do not blame the moonlight If not get off of my desk Now, I'll call security. Let's do the following: I'll send a video demo... and if you still think that we should not participate, fine. What do you say? And it promises to get off of my table now? Yes! I hope it's a video demo fantastic. - A video demo? - Yes.. But it is only a formality. They just want to see how amazing "Barry and the Group of Earthworms. " Guys? Listen! Everyone wants to see stars the disk, right? Our image must be one? Band insect? And no worms... and I think the fantastic clothes that Gloria will help that. Maybe I should put more sequins... for all cameras. The details are also roses beautiful, I can put some... It's fun to stay at the YMCA They have everything For your enjoyment mental They loved the clothes. You can see it. No wonder. They were fantastic. Listen, Barry, need to tell you one thing. You know that feeling... when you know someone you see who you really are? I know exactly what you mean! I'm not sure how to say. You know, is the first time someone really believe me. Finally someone who knows me, taste, and knows how to sing. Absolutely. And who supports me and tells me... I've really got talent... and he should know, after all, he is Tony Dean. What did you say? - "Love"! "Bellissima!" - Tony? This is the same for me? They need water right now. Then you are taken off the worm. He knew it was making a video to participate in the contest. It will be very cool. None how not to win. Not really. Win? You are worms! Made to crawl the trash of others. Can not beat the man, the myth, the legend... Tony Dean! Yeah, but you have not heard Our new sound, you hear? Can not wait. I'm looking forward to it! Remember, increase the level of vocals. Oh, Gloria... See you tomorrow! You leave me breathless. Just like when I hear your fantastic voice! - Really? - Sing for me. Love I want to keep the reputation I'm feeling a Incredible! Overtime, studies to test, overtime, studies to test... hardly see it more at night. No... Continue with the good job. Mrs.. Olson died of envy when I heard that you will be manager. Perhaps you could know a good young worm soon... That is unlikely. Wait and see. Guys with good jobs are rare items. The daughter of Mrs.. Olson works accounting. And when you pass the test Saturday... - Saturday? - Yikes! As if a worm had not nothing better to do. Especially with so much space in the closet. Oh Frank! It's time for news. Go turn on the TV! Ah, yes! TV... Almost forgot! Barry, you better pass the exam! Otherwise, my poor and weak heart will break in two. And remember, the sound of insects! No sound of worms, right? 3-2-1... What's going on? It's crazy when I'm here the test run is coming... Let comcear! What are you doing? Tony says our music is better when my voice is at its highest. We can not concentrate more on your dancing? What is your problem? Tony said he could come here hear me sing and you will not... spoil my great chance to sing! What? You did not tell Tony we're here at... Although it is not my trainee Barry. The subject of jokes. I can explain everything. Do not tell me. His friends cheated to wear a costume? Right. Very good. Easy now. Think about that the disk can do for the company! Unless they are all willing to be "downsized" right now... I suggest that you proactively... remove these instruments Site now! Quietly, the door funds. Now! Right. Try fertilizer without us. We are no longer slaves! We are stars of the disc! Where did all... What are you making? Come back! Stop! Listen... Barry! Not here. Listen. Let's go swimming in money! We will have thousands of fans going crazy with us! Right? I'm not down none of this even... Can see, no? From here, there is only one direction, and that's up! Settle down! I'm with my guitar. Not a guitar What is holding! Oh no! Where are we? Live bait? Only two dollars? No No way! Ending a place like this! And at this stage of my life! Tony said that my voice could take me much further... and that I would have much success. Tony said this... Tony said that! Do not you see he only praised to win the contest? You are a playful, Barry. Funny? Roots of trees have more feelings than you! I can tell you that Tony Dean think different! Listen! You could not sing nor that his life depended on it. But you said... also... Hey, we're in this for his sake and because of your fucking contest. There are no, because there is no contest. What? - They do not want worms participate. - How? Do you think the rest of us sounds better than Gloria? We live in a hole, eat the earth! Hard to do with party and uplifting. Some of you know what that is? Take, took the wedding party of silver from my parents. It was pretty cool. Get real! Worms do not dance! Only serve to stay the end of a rusty hook... and this is something we do very well. Hey, take me! Oh no, never gonna leave. And I was wanting both be mid-level manager... Hello! Will have to hit harder. This glass is super thick, man. No use, no way to break this glass... Wait. Unless... Gloria? How about standing beside the glass and sing a little for us? - But you told me... - No, no. You're great! Fantastic! Especially when sing the high notes! Now? At first I was afraid was petrified thought I could not live Without you by my side But you're singing in tune. You know, suddenly, everything makes sense. It's like you said, Barry. The important thing is to feel what she sings. And I really I feel your pain and loss. No, no. You misunderstood the letter. She is happy! It's in the shower, screaming with joy! Can not you feel? The song... is talking to us! you again From Outer Space I just walked found you here With the sad expression on her face I should have changed My lock idiot should have done You leave your key If I knew For just a second you'd be back to bother me Go away now Exit through the door Turn around now Because you're not welcome anymore Were not you What did hurt me getting out thought I would crumble That I lay down and die Oh, I do not I will survive long as I know love I know I'll stay alive I have a life to live I have all my love to give will survive I will survive Oh no!

No, seriously. I like it! Mostly Village People! Especially the cute with leather pants. Yikes. I have to do all alone? Crawl for their lives! Run! We're saved. Escaped. As I am relieved! What I said before... It was a... joke, right? Push the rusty hook on me! I'm just a worm ridiculous, right? We can not allow he goes fishing with Barry. Somehow, he was who told us to run. Whether you agree, is Barry! I think we should respect his wishes! Listen, do not ask what your band... what your band can do for you, but what we can do for your band. Yeah! And now it's time to save the singer! Nobody will miss me when I leave, nor my mother likes me. What the hell... Goodbye, cruel world! Goodbye piles of fertilizer, soil clay and beetles ridiculous!
