It's only a day and a half of work, and you gonna be making $150. - I look like a damn fool. - I'm gonna come in. Okay. One, two, thre... You better stop it. Eileen, you come in on three. You don't say, "One, two," and come in. You say, "Three." Then you come in. Look at you. You are dressed for success. I look like the whole damn red-light district. I ain't had nothing like this on since I was on that pole. Ooh. Well, just think of this as another pole. The North Pole. They don't make it rain at the North Pole. At my age, I can't get no rain nowhere. I get a little drizzle, but them quarters hurt. No, no, no. Well, this is beautiful. Just think of this as a little extra money for you and Cora. Honey, I don't buy Cora nothing for Christmas. I ain't bought her nothing since she was seven years old. - You're kidding. - That's right. Cora asked me for some money for some dolls named Starz. I couldn't afford it. She just wanted them Starz. So all day Christmas, she made me feel bad. That night, Christmas dinner, she's still sitting at the table crying. I knocked the hell out of her. You know what happened? She saw stars. And she never asked me for another gift. - You are dreadful. Yes, you are. - The truth. - I can't do this, Eileen. - Yes, you can. Stop. - Now, just smile. - Okay. I'm smiling. Now, you should see... Come over here. I gotta take you where you working. You should see the lovely gifts I bought for my daughter. - How she doing? - Oh, she is excellent. You know she went to New York to get a degree... got her master's and up and moved to Alabama of all places. - What the hell she move to Alabama for? - Who knows. Anyway, she took a little job there in some little, small school, you know. She says she wants to start a farm. - A farm? What she starting a farm for? - I don't know. I don't know. But anyway, you know she got tons of offers down here in Atlanta. But she didn't want to, so what can you do? - Maybe she's trying to get away from you. - You better stop that. - Where we going? - My daughter loves me. Round yon Virgin Mother... - Was that you singing? - No, ma'am. There's no one else in there, Bailey McCoy. Come on. Walk with me. You're late again. I'm sorry. - I'm gonna have to talk to your parents. - No. I just woke up late. I'll be here on time. I promise. Budget cuts, budget cuts. All right. Go on in class. - We'll talk about this later. Okay? - Okay. And your singing. I'm not gonna come in here and listen to this. All right, people! Now, we may have to cancel the Christmas Jubilee this year. - No way! - We don't have the budget! Mayor, you hold on right there. All right? Now, I grew "poinsetters" for this. Poinsettias. - That's what I said. - No, you didn't. If this Christmas Jubilee don't happen... what am I gonna do with all them "poinsetters"? - Poinsettias. - Stop. Do I look stupid? - Tanner, I understand. - No, sir... with all due respect, I don't think you do. Since they built that dam upriver, we've been barely surviving. Between that and the drought... managed to put most of our crops out of business. We need this Christmas Jubilee to happen. You hear me? We don't have the money. I talked to the city council, didn't I? You did, Your Honor. He talked to him. I heard him. - Take it out of the school. - Hold on, Tanner McCoy. We've already cut the school's budget... and as principal, I have to draw the line. We have four teachers teaching several classes. If we cut back more, we'll not be able to finish the school year. I don't care. Somebody has to do something. We have to have this Christmas Jubilee. It helps too many people around here make enough money just to stay open. We don't have the budget! When we elected you as mayor, you said you would help us! I know. I'm sorry. Folks around here don't take too kindly to politicians not keeping their word. You keep putting all these good people against the wall and see what happens. Come on, fellas. Geez. - This is ridiculous. - Absolutely. - You believe that guy? - That was unpleasant. Yes, it was. - This is where you'll be working. - Okay. Okay? Have you ever done sales before? - Yes, I sold trees. - Christmas trees? When you smoke 'em, they make you feel like it's Christmas. If you don't stop that nasty talk. Stop it. I mean, where goods were exchanged. I was exchanging my goodies back in the day. Yes, indeed. - I got to bring... - On the black market. - I got to bring you back to church. - You ain't bringing me to no church. I ain't goin' to no church. The devil is a lie. - And you still married to him. - Honey, honey... - Speak of the devil, listen. Listen. - What, what, what? - Y'all want me to work the register? - No, no. - Other people take... - You sure? You have to be bonded for that job. If I took the register, I'd be bonded out. Okay. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Listen, let's go over a little quick review of what you're supposed to do. - You teach me. - You're supposed to direct the customers... when they ask you for something, and you can refer to this. Okay? Now, kitchenware is on the fifth floor. - Kitchenware, fifth floor. - Yes. - Women's apparel is on the second... - Y'all sell pears? Y'all got produce up there? - Clothing. Women's clothing. - Say, "Clothing." Don't say, "A pears." I don't know what "apparels" is. "A pears." Okay. Young adults is on the third floor. - Young adults on the third floor. - Makeup and perfume is here. And over there across the hall. - I get it. I'll be fine. - All right, and listen. Most important, everybody gets the same greeting. When they come in, you look them in the face... you smile pretty and you say, "Merry Christmas. It's a beautiful day at Tifton's. Joy to you and yours. Yes, may I help you?" That what I say? Fine. I will say that. - You wanna go over it once? - All right. - Here's a customer. Okay. - Can you help me? - Yes. Merry... - Yes. Mary had a little... - No, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - It's a beautiful day at Tip... - Tifton's. - Tap... Tip... Tiptoes. - Joy to you. Joy to the world and the Lord is come, and happy Easter. What can... What can I do for you at Tifton's? Thank you. I'm looking for women's lingerie. Honey? Who the lingerie for? For me, of course. I don't know about you wearing the lingeries. Those days are over, honey. Somebody should've told you it's passed. The lingeries is for young people with tight, firm stuff. What I would suggest you do, hunty... I would suggest you walk across the street to Target... and ask them for some of those really nice big, big-girl drawers... so that you will be comfortable. You don't wanna walk around with a slingshot up your butt. - Eileen! - Come, come, come. Come. Let me help you. - You are so rude! - She's something. No, you are the one that's rude anytime you bring lingerie to a man. Who was the 37th president of the United States? I know. Bailey, do you know? I know the answer. I didn't ask you. I asked Bailey. He don't know. He's always dirty. And he's just a farm boy. Yes, but he's the only one to get an A on all three of his last tests. What did you get, Lucy? Or you, Larry? There will be no bullying in this class. I'll see you all tomorrow. Do your homework. Look over the list of songs for the Christmas Jubilee. Christmas is five days away. Hold on a second, Bailey. You gotta start speaking up and participating in class. I know you knew the answer. You're are so smart and talented. You get an A on every test. You gotta believe in yourself. Lucy's right. I'm just an old farm boy. There is no such thing as "just a farm boy." You are smart. You can be anything you want. I can only imagine if you could just stay awake in class. - Are you up late at night? - No, ma'am. I want you to sing the lead solo at the Christmas Jubilee. I'm sorry. I can't do that. - Yes, you can. - No. You know what? I really gotta go, Miss Williams. My daddy's gonna be waiting for me at home. Go on. Hello? I don't hear from you in six years... and you call me out of the blue because you need my help. Don't blame that on me. You're the one who married Kelly and stopped returning my calls. You're not still bitter, are you? Maybe. How is she? I don't know. We're divorced. Good. She was such a tramp. I can't believe you married her and dumped me. That's what you get. Okay, okay. Hey, pull up, It was high school. Am I forgiven? That depends. Can you help me with my school situation? - So you need sponsorship? - Yes. A call came in just as I was leaving a meeting.. With a company that's in the middle of a PR nightmare. They could use some goodwill right now. Actually, in a town like yours. So your timing may be perfect. Tell me about it. Can't do that until we have a contract. - You don't trust me? - No, no, no, it's not that. I have to protect my interests, that's all. Tell you what. I'll come down with a contract, you get your people to sign... and I'm sure I can pull in... at least a hundred grand for your school and its event. $100,000. That would be great. How soon can you get here? You need the money right away, don't you? Yeah. So you're willing to drive down to Alabama? I will drive over tomorrow. We'll get the contract signed, then I'll have to leave... but I'll be back for the event. That would be fantastic. Oliver, thank you so much. See you soon. - You got it. - Bye. Child, that Powerball is going up. Hello? Hey, I need y'all to go get me some scratch-offs. - Yeah, and play the numbers for me. - Can you help me? That Powerball has gotten really high. Play number 22... - Excuse me. - 17,5 and 6. Go play them numbers, and bring me a bunch of scratch offs. Yeah. Just two, three of 'em. Don't spend a lot of money. I need some help! Hold on, 'cause somebody's screaming at me. I'm getting ready to choke her. Hold on. Lady, you gonna need a damn doctor if you holler at me again. Do you understand? Now, what can I help you with? - I need a watch for my husband. - A men's watch. A men's watch. You know, I like it with a leather band. - You know, a nice thin watch. - Here are some men's... Oh, hell. It's time for my break. - Time for my break. - Break? No, wait. - You're so rude. - Bye, bye, bye. - You rude as hell. You rude as hell. - Please. I need a watch. Get out of my way. I'm trying to go to the break room. Wait! Come back! You still here? He called me back. Yeah? And? He thinks he can get us $100,000 in sponsorship money. $100,000? - Oh, my goodness, that would be so great. - I know. That would not only pay for the Jubilee... that would take us well into next year's school year. We could get new books, maybe even a new computer. Wait, calm down. It hasn't happened yet. It's not done. Okay, but I have faith that it is. Lacey, thank you so much for doing this. I really appreciate it. I know this school is not the best, but it is all we got. And I know you could have gone anywhere in the country... with the credentials you have. - I love it here. - Thank you. He's coming down tomorrow with the contract. This is so wonderful! I gotta call the mayor. - Yes. - He's gonna be so excited. This is going to be a wonderful Christmas after all! It's gonna be fantastic. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. - Hello? - I must be dialing the wrong number. You said that already, but you called back five times. So what number you trying to get? I'm trying to reach my daughter, Lacey. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she just walked in. Hold on. - Who is that? - Your mama. - Hi, Mama. - Who was that? That was Conner. Conner? That's the guy you hired to help you with the farm? Yeah, that's him. Okay. I don't know if I like him up there with you. Suppose he gets fresh... and you don't have no man up there to protect you. Mama, I'm fine. What's going on? I can't wait until you taste the dinner... I have prepared for you for Christmas. Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. I'm not gonna be able to come home this year. What? Uh-uh. It's Christmas. I know, it's just I'm just getting settled in... and the farm needs a lot of work. Uh-uh. You not no farmer in the dell now. It's not just the farm. They've also decided to extended the school year... to the day before Christmas. - What kind of school is that? - We lost a lot of days... because of the storms this summer, so we have to make them up, And I'm helping the kids prepare songs for the Christmas Jubilee. And we have a budget crisis. So it's just too busy right now, Mom. I'll come up there. - No. - Yes. - I haven't seen you in nine months... - It's not the right time. And you don't drive. I can get somebody to drive up there with me. I can ask your Aunt Madea to come with me. Mama, can we just skip it this year? It's only Christmas. You bite your tongue, Christmas is the time of year... when we celebrate the birth of Jesus with our families and... Lacey, I don't have to tell you that... you and I are the only family we have, I know. Mom, are you crying? What was that, Conner? I didn't say anything. I'm sorry. Conner needs my help, Mama. I gotta go. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Love you Bye, Do not look at me like that. You don't understand. I didn't say a word. Are you okay? Girl, I don't know why I let you talk me into comin' and doin' this job. - I didn't take my medicine this morning. - What medicine? Five milligrams of "Don't choke that ho." These customers gettin' right... I feel I'm getting ready to maybe catch a case. - I could spit. - What's wrong with you? Lacey's not coming for Christmas. That ain't no problem. Children grow up. They don't wanna come home sometimes. Something's wrong. - Eileen? - What? I know that look in your eye. Don't go jumpin' to no conclusion. I don't jump to conclusions. Last time you went to the doctor, you had a rash. Walked up in there, told the man you had cancer and you was dying. Madea, many people in my family have died of cancer. - I know your family. - Yes. - My grandmother. - Got hit by a bus. But she had cancer. My uncle Bayrod. - Drowned. - Because he had cancer. - Eileen? - What? No, no, no, no. Something is wrong. Something is wrong with my child, and I'm gonna find out what it is. She's down there in the country, and I don't know what's going on. I haven't seen where she works, where she live. - It's just awful! - Your daughter is grown. Leave her alone. If she want to come home, she will come home. What you planning on doing? I'm gonna go down there. I'd like to see that, 'cause you don't drive. - You do. - Child, I ain't goin' to no Alabama. Last time I was in Alabama, I was chained to Andy Young and Jesse Jackson. - You marched? - We wasn't upright when we was marching. - We gonna go down there. - I'm not driving to no Alabama. All my stuff is illegal. I don't like driving through Georgia. You think I'm gettin' ready to drive through Alabama? - I'll pay you. - What time you wanna leave? Okay. Good. No, child. I can't get on the road with my Cadillac. It's got 4,785,000 miles on it, and I just changed the oil in it. Every light on the dashboard say... "You crazy as hell if you go anywhere in me." - Madea... - I can't do it, hon. I'm sorry. Have you ever thought maybe she just don't want to see you, Eileen? My daughter loves me. She loves spending time with me. All right, honey. If you find a ride, I'll go up there with you. All right. Well, I will work on it. Conner. - What the hell you think you're doin'? - What are you talking about? I was down at the feed store. They tell me you're planning on planting corn this year. Yeah, I was. I plant corn. Well, actually, what I'm working on can help all of us. - What you're working on? - Yeah. You think you learned something down in that college that I don't know about? - That's not what I meant, Tanner. - No, you don't. And you better find something else to plant. You been gone from around here for far too long. I mean it, Conner. Otherwise, I'll be here every day, kick your ass like I did back in school. Eileen, we've had a lot of complaints about your friend. Oh, no. Hey there. I was getting ready to go... - What's the matter? - We're going to have to ask you to leave. Good, it's about damn time. I get out of... Give me my check. We'll mail it to you. No, honey. Eileen, you better tell her. Ain't nobody gonna mail me no check. I didn't mail my work up in here. You ain't mailing me no check. Where's my money? Madea, go home. I'll call you later. I don't give a damn who calling who. Somebody gonna give me my money. Would you please leave quietly? Oh, sure. You want me to leave quietly? You want me to leave quietly? I will show you how to leave damn quietly. Y'all gonna give me my damn money. But before I get my damn purse, I'm gonna get money out this register. - Excuse me. - No, no. No, you can't do that. Put... Madea. Where my purse? Unlock the damn thing! I got my purse here. This is $150. - This is what you owe me. - Put that money back. I'm gonna take something else. I'm gonna take this dress. - Stop it! - Take whatever I want out of here. What's this pulling on me? You're embarrassing us. What the hell y'all looking at? What the hell all y'all looking at? It's Christmas, and I'm takin' what the hell I want up in here! What y'all gonna do about it? What y'all gonna do about it? - I'll take this too. - She didn't take her medication today. You got me coming up here, trying to work in this place... and I don't know what the hell gonna... Get out the way! What the hell goin' on? - I know what the hell I'm doing! - She has never acted like this before. I'm fabulous. I'm gone with the wind fabulous. I am so sorry. Hi. I'm Lacey Williams, Bailey's teacher. - Right. Come on in. - Thank you. - How are you? - I'm fine. I just stopped by to talk to you. I graded another one of Bailey's homework assignments... Listen, I'm sorry. He has to help his daddy at night, so he doesn't get much time to study. Then he gets up early in the morning to work with him... so I'll just have to get on him to do better. He can't get any better. - He gets straight A's. - What? Yeah. And to know he works after school and in the morning... is even more impressive. He really should go to a gifted school with a fine arts department. Wow. I always knew he was smart. I didn't know he was that smart. Me and his daddy never got much schoolin'. You really think Bailey could make it outside of this place? I know he can. I mean, that's really all I want for him. Bailey is always telling me how good you are to him... and that you defend him in front of those other kids, so thank you. - Well, he's a very special boy. - Yeah, he is. - Have a seat. - Sure. Thank you. - Can I get you something to drink? - Yes. Thanks. Thank you. He also told me you want him to sing at the Christmas Jubilee? Yes. He has a beautiful voice. You think the Jubilee is gonna happen this year? Yes, haven't you heard? I got a friend of mine to get us a sponsorship for it. So it's definitely gonna happen. - That's great news. - Yeah, it really is. Oh, hell. What do you want? - Hi, I'm Lacey Williams. - I know who you are. You're Bailey's teacher. Bailey's gonna be late to school. He's got a lot of work to do here, that's if he makes it at all. No need come around here no more. Okay? I am so sorry. Merry Christmas. Oliver, this is so funny. I hadn't spoken to your mother in a while, and we got talking... and she said you were drivin' to Alabama to see Lacey! Miss Eileen, I'm happy to have the company. Did I tell you I take blood pressure medicine that makes me have to pee? - I'll have to go to the bathroom soon. - Okay, go in the bush. I'm not putting my tush over no bush.

She's always like this, since a child. - Yeah, since my childhood. - Something's wrong. Something's wrong, but we accept it. You sure you didn't tell her we were coming? I wanted this to be a big surprise! I'm sure. 'Cause she's gonna be so happy to see you! Madea, I told him how much Lacey talks about him. Why you hollerin' like I'm in the back of an airplane and you in first class? I can hear you. You right here. All I'm saying is this... - What's your name, boy? Olive Oil? - Oliver. All I'm saying is this. If she wanted to talk to you, she would have called you all the time. Don't get your hopes up listening to Eileen. Don't listen to her. You two are gonna be together again. You'd like that, wouldn't you? I see it on your face. I see it on your face. Yeah! I would like to see us have another chance. Y'all was in high school back then. I got to pee, son.

Hell, they're KKK! - This ain't the right address, is it? - That's what she said. This can't be the right address. These people might not be friendly. Look, this is 2013, and it's almost Christmas. Sure it'll be fine. Boy, did you see what I just went through in town? True. This just don't feel right. Up here in these woods, ain't nobody around but us and trees. I don't like this. Go knock on the door. - Thanks a lot. - What you worried about, son? Somebody got to live to tell the story. Tell 'em what happened to you. Somebody got be an activist. Somebody got to call Sharpton.

You better bite your tongue. She is happy to see me anytime. Tell her. That don't look like happiness, honey. That look like puredee constipation. Hi, Conner. How are ya? How ya doing? This handsome thing... this is Oliver, her boyfriend. Her boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. It was nice of you to call him. That was a nice ruse to get to see him. Fund-raiser. No, it wasn't a ruse. You know you miss him. Anyway, could you get my bags, farmhand, please? - Yeah. - I'll help. Lacey, come show us this farm. A little dusty, dusty. Come, my dear. I knew that. Baby, you know you got asthma. Mama, I don't have asthma anymore. Yeah, but you still gotta be careful... because that could lead to cancer. Everything don't lead to cancer, Eileen. Lord, help her.

Ask the man to bring the groceries in. - They're in the trunk of the car. - His name is Conner. I don't like you being up here with him by yourself. What is Oliver supposed to think, you living with a man? Why should I care what Oliver thinks? - You should. He still wants you. - Mama, please. No, and you still want him. I know it. I got that feeling. I want some grandbabies. What you waiting on? Eileen, stop meddling with that girl. Okay? You is in everybody's business. Just leave this child alone.

You better think of something. - Baby... - Boyfriend. - Are you ready to go? - Yes, sure. Hold on. Hold on. I heard somebody say, "Go." Oh, Lord. Take me anywhere. I got to get away from your mama. I'll go to hell and back to get away from her. She talk too damn much. Can I go with y'all? Okay. Maybe you can keep an eye on my class while I go into the meeting. I'm sorry. Watch your class? She wants me to watch her class. Children? Child, me and children don't get along. Now, let me see. Ankle-biting... disease-carrying... little children of God, or your mama... satanic, loud-mouthed, diarrhea woman from hell. I think I'll go with the children. Praise God. - All right. - I'll drop you back off on my way home. Okay, close your trunk, son. Close your trunk. I'm gonna ride with him. No offense to y'all car, 'cause this a nice car. But this bring back memories, child. I got pregnant. Meat Loaf was playing "Dashboard Light." I was sitting up there, and I kept hitting my head on that steering wheel. It was just awful. It was an awful time. Look. The door even sound the same. Child, this is just what it's... Yep, that bring back memories. Watch this. That's what I used to do. Drop it. That car built for comfort and built for speed, just like me. This a nice truck, but how I'm s'posed to get in here? - Pull the seat back. - I'll sit in the back. Hold on. No, you don't have to... Yeah, just pull that back. You got to get some of them things to help me get in here. Is there something to... Hold on. I got it. Yeah, that's it. Come on in. Boy, you got to get a low car here. - You 'bout to make me mad. - Give me your hand. - Now, hold on. - All right, I got you. - Good morning, class. - Good morning. This is my Aunt Mabel. But everybody calls her Madea. I have to go to a meeting down the hall with Ms. Porter... and I asked Miss Madea to keep an eye on you. Now, you know what to do and you know how to behave, right? Yes, ma'am. - I'll be right back. Thanks, Madea. - Yeah, I love it. I love well-behaved children. That's wonderful. Y'all look so nice. Hello. Hello. Now, y'all got to go back to the Stepford children. Don't act like you... Don't act like this. Now, calm the hell down. I'm in here. Do yourself a favor. Do the right thing. - You belong in this class? - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. What's your name? - Bailey. Bailey? Okay. Well, go on. Your teacher went down the hall, and I'm sitting in for her. Have a seat. You better hope she comes back. She's the only teacher that likes you here. Don't sit by me. You are so dirty. Leave that boy alone. Where else he gonna sit? Sit down, son. Sit down. Don't worry about her. Don't you ever pick on somebody just 'cause you can. Do you understand? They used to do that to me when I was in kindergarten. 'Cause I was six feet tall, they all want to talk about me. I had a full figure and curves and all that stuff. They wanted to make fun of me. But I wasn't having it. You understand? I fought back. That's why I got tough-skinned. You may have to fight back sometimes. Do you understand? Don't worry about these people in here trying to make you feel bad. You got to be nice to people. Pass it on, niceness. - Do you understand? - Yes, ma'am. All right, I'm going to write my name on the board... so you all will know what my name is. Ain't no chalk. Y'all ain't got no chalk? Ain't got no eraser either. "No cause..." Okay. I don't know what all that mean. All right. Well, what we gonna do is... I'm gonna tell y'all a story. This is the story of Christmas. Christmas. This is what I learned when I went to school... Sunday school. This is the story of the nativities. Little baby Jesus was born. He was born to the Virgin Mary... J. Blige, and as Mary was on tour... she met this man named Joe... Manganiello, who played a werewolf. And he was in love with her. She said, "Joe. I am thou-ist with the child-ist. And the holiness is come upon me... and I'm going to have a baby-ist." And Joe said, "Really?" They ain't know what to do. So he went on and stayed with her... and they went on 'cause they was expecting the holy child. That's right. And the Bible say in second "Deuteronomo"... that when he came to the earth... he came through the Virgin... pia colada. And as she was there... they were trying to find somewhere to have the baby... but they kept going to all these hotels, and wouldn't none of 'em let them in. Marriott. Shut the door. Hilton. Shut the door. Tried to get to the Ritz-Carlton, they said, "You don't belong here." Everybody just got put out. They went to the Motel 6. They didn't even leave the light on for her. She was in the dark. Anyway, there was Mary... 'bout to have that baby, so she sat down at a bus stop. MARTA bus passed by, wouldn't even pick her up... to take her to the holy city of Birmingham. And as she sat there, she went into laborer. And as she started laboring... a mangy dog walked up beside her. See, God will send you a dog when you need it, even if you don't. And that dog said, "What's wrong with you?" And as she sat there, she had that baby... and that baby came next to that mangy dog. That's why they say he was born in a mangy. Hallelujah. Let the Lord use ya. Okay, that's the story of the baby Jesus. That's the hip-hop version. I'm glad I went to church and to Sunday school. Okay. Where my purse? Where my purse? Y'all ain't seen what happened to my purse? I'm gonna tell y'all another story. This is the story of Easter Sunday. Jesus was hanging between two thieves. One was Baranibus and the other was the Dinosaurus. Somebody better find my purse right now. - All we have to do is sign that thing? - Yes. Lacey told me you needed the money right away. So I spoke with my boss and got the money in advance. We're both very sure we'll get the sponsorship. What's in it for you? Well, my company gets paid a 10% commission by the company. You get the entire 100 grand. It will help us with the shortfall. - Is everything okay, Wilbur? - Yes, Your Honor. It's good. It is good. All right then. Let's do this. Wonderful. Here you go. Now, we'll bring the sponsors down to the Jubilee for a photo op. - That's all we ask. - Of course. - Thank you, son. - You got it. Thank you so much. You have no idea how much we needed this. - It's my pleasure. - Lacey. - Thank you. - This is my town too. Glad I can help. - Thank you. - Thank you. After you. There you go. You have no clue how much you've just helped us. I mean... It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. - Thank you again. - You got it. - Here. - What's this? - It's your Christmas present. - No. I can't take that. - Sure you can. - I really can't. You've already done enough for us. Thank you. What are you doing? Your mother told me she thought you missed me. Look, I know we were children, but I think about you still. Listen, Oliver, that was a long time ago... - and I actually have to tell you... - Lacey! - Get in here. Quick! - Excuse me. Hurry! There's a weird woman in here. What they did back in the day... Lacey, who is this? - My aunt Madea. - Hi. What are you doing? I was just teaching these children a lesson on Jesus... from the time he was born until the time he died on Earth. She tried to steal my purse, but I taught her a lesson. Here you go. Now you have been crowned the Christmas... Praise. Hallelujah. - I got her, didn't I? I got her, Bailey. - Yes, ma'am. 'Scuse me. Oliver, take me to the house. I'm getting the hell outta here. We'll talk when I get back for the Jubilee. Lucy. How do you even... How did she... That's a nice-lookin' tree. - Hey, baby. - Hey. - Are they here yet? - Nope. I rushed home. How's my mother? I don't know. She only said two words to me. You think of how you're gonna handle this yet? No. Were you able to talk to your parents? Nope, no cell phone. Guess I'll have to talk to 'em now 'cause they're here. - Hey, hey! - Hi, y'all! Hey, hey! Look at you! Don't you go nowhere. I'm gonna get your mama. - I look all right? - Yeah, you look great. - Son! Son! - Mama! Daddy! Look at you! Daddy, not the bear hug! Your old man still got it, don't he? Look at my Grizzly Adams. Look at you. You look like a mountain man. Hey, Son, see this? This ain't fat. This is all foreskin. Buddy, stop. Don't start so early. - You must be Lacey. - Yes. Look at you! - Oh, my! - You put her down. You don't gotta break her and snap her neck. Just give him a little nudge to the flapjacks there. He'll put you down. Where are my manners? I am Conner's mama. Please call me Mrs. Williams. - Hi. - I kiddin'! You... Call me Kim or Mama. Just don't call me late for dinner. I'm joshing you. - Look how pretty. She's very pretty. - Thank you. She is even more beautiful than I ever could have imagined. Thank you. So nice to finally meet you. You too. Look at this place. It is beautiful. This place is stupendous. My mama and daddy... Sorry. I'm sorry. They just would've been so proud. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you, Mama. I was so upset when I heard you two eloped. I thought maybe you'd come down to Louisiana... and went up the bayou for the Swamp Manor to get hitched. We would have thrown you such a shindig. You know that. Hey, I'm glad y'all did elope. You done saved me an assload of money. So I appreciate it. Well, you've spent enough money on me already, Daddy. - I'm glad you recognize that. - Honey, we love you. Anything you want, my son. Anything. Well... Have you two eaten? No, but... Good, 'cause I caught Christmas dinner. Caught? We are gonna have hot possum potpie. I'm gonna make it. It's good. Nice flaky crust. Gonna have possum stew... and your uncle DeWayne done got me some white lightning. Here, let me take this, Daddy. Actually, Lacey's a vegetarian. She's a vegetarianist? On a farm. - Honey, that must be hard. - That don't mean nothing. We's Baptist, and we still like a nice possum stew every now and then. No, Buddy. It means she doesn't eat meat. - She doesn't eat meat. - Oh, you're a tofu farter. - Daddy. - Ain't nothing wrong with that. I like tofu farters. God bless you. All I'm saying, Son, if she don't eat meat... that might be a bad thing when it comes to certain parts of the anatomy. Mama, can you please... I'm sorry. We just met her. Now, stop. - Start slow, all right? - I was just kidding. I'm sorry. He's crazy. What are we doing standing out here getting all dusty? Let's go inside and get our meal on. I'm starvin'. I brought you some spices from your Aunt Tutu's garden. - Okay. Mama... - You're gonna love 'em. - Let me go get that. - Hang on, y'all. Lacey's mama is cookin'. Lacey's ma... She's here? - Your mama's here now? - Yes. - Her mama is here, Buddy. - Hey, hey! All right. Looks like we get to meet the in-laws. Actually, we kind of have a problem. What's the problem? Lacey hadn't told her mama that we're married. - What? - Why ain't you told her? Well... my mother had dreams for my entire life... and Conner was not in that dream. I'm sorry. I do... - I don't understand. - I think I do. Let me ask you something. When she had them dreams, was they in color or black-and-white? She doesn't want you with a white man. I'm sorry. That's awful. Honey, we taught all of our children... "Never see color. Only see heart." - Isn't that right, Conner? - That's right. It's such a shame she does not know what kind of person you are. I'll tell you who he is. Always taught him to look at a woman's heart. 'Cause that's where their rack hangs. Daddy. I'm just kiddin'. She got a nice rack. Your mama used to have a nice rack. Now she bends over, just looks like she's got a 7-10 split. - What the hell does that mean? - It's a bowling term. - I don't like that, Daddy. - I don't either. I'm just kiddin'. I still like to go to the bowling alley every now and then. - You're sexy to me. - Will you hush? I'm gonna start talking about all your wrinkly, saggy parts. - It's like a turkey giblet in there. - That was over the line. Well, honey, Conner, who does she think you are? She thinks I'm the farm help. - Well, there's a switcheroo. - The farm help. Do you think we should leave? I think we should maybe leave. I ain't goin' nowhere. Hell, I just drove up here. - I am tired. I want a beer. - I don't want you guys to leave. Well, what should we do? Can you give me some time to tell her? I mean, I have to break it to her gently. She's been very sick. - Oh, no. - I'm so sorry. - What's wrong? - She has a weak heart. Then by all means, you just... take your time and tell her when you're ready. - Thank you. - Okay. We don't want her ticker to tock out on you here. - We'll behave ourselves. - Yeah. - You know what we'll be? - What? - Parents of the help. - That's right. Parents of the help. - "Can I get you something?" - Let's head in. - Come on. - Daddy, behave. I'll behave. Like a bull in a rodeo. - Did you paint this? This is fabulous. - I started. - Still needs some work. - Where you at? I bet this house run them in the double figures. - Hey, Madea. - Hey! - This is my mama, Kim. - How you doin'? - Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Medium. And this is my daddy, Buddy. - Nice to meet you. - How you doin', Buddy? - I'm doing well. - I see y'all brought a bag. No, that's just my wife. Forgive my husband. He is just a horse's ass and a half. - Wait. I smell cookin'. - Yeah, that's Eileen. - Her mama was up in there cooking. - Where is she? She was in the kitchen, but she went to the backyard. Come on. Sit down. Take a load off. Take a load off. Y'all sit a spell. - Y'all want something to drink? - I believe I'll have something. I like you. You're a nice lady. Don't be flirting with me in front of your wife. If I put this thing on, you won't be able to get rid of it. I'll have him pay my rent, car note and everything else. I'm from the old school. Believe me, he can't help it. And if you can stand him, you're welcome to him, right? - Hey, Conner, get me a beer. - Yes, sir. Well, Miss Madea... looks like we're gonna be spending Christmas dinner together this year... but don't you worry. We could care less you're black. "African-American," Buddy. Right, whatever. African-American. That's all right. I don't care that y'all are white America... Angro... Angrola-Saxons... Saxophonists. I don't care. That don't matter at all that y'all Anglo-Saxophonists. I like her. She's got a good sense of humor and those big, sturdy feet. You need a good sense of humor with this group in here. - Here, Daddy, beer. Drink up. - Appreciate it. - Please, drink up. - I'll tell you what, Son. That last girl you with was so dadgum ugly... my dog humped her leg and shut his eyeballs. Oh, stop it. He's awful! "He shut his eyeballs." That's ugly. Please forgive my husband. He is a wannabe comedian. You are no Jeff Foxworthy. Well, I try to be, but who can? Who can? Did you hear the one about the two rabbis and the black dude? - Daddy. - No. Did you hear the one about the stray bullet that killed the redneck... for telling the story about the rabbis and the black dude? It's hilarious! I got him, didn't I? I got him. - Y'all get your ass shot. - I like her. I do. I do too. She likes to hang. No, ain't gonna be no hanging around here now. No, he didn't mean that. He meant that... You calm the hell down? You are so politically correct. They're having fun. I'm having fun too. I wasn't offended. Hell, I got a pistol. I knew she knew that. Let me ask you this. Do you know Oprah? Honey, I told you... all black folk don't necessarily know each other. - Could've fooled me. - Do I look like Paul Bunyan or what? Actually, you sure in the hell do. And the Jolly Green Giant too. Ho-ho-ho. - Farmhand, please help me. - His name is Conner. Whew! I think the tree... would look good right here. If you don't mind me butting in... I think it would look really pretty right here by the window... and that way all the passersby can enjoy it. That's where we had it every year. - And who are you? - That's a pretty tree. I am... I'm Conner's mom. That's Kim and that's Buddy. These are Coroner's parents. This is Eileen. I wanna scream. I mean, Eileen. Trees are for the family, not for strangers. What the hell these people doing here? Mama, they came to visit Conner for Christmas. Really? That is just like my daughter. I raised you right. My daughter has always been good with helping the help. Yes. - Where you staying? - We're thinking of staying here. Yeah. We drove all the way up from Louisiana... to spend Christmas with Conner and Lacey. It'll be a little cramped... but we'll make do. Madea and I will share a room. You, Buddy and... Kim. Kim, take another room... - and Carver... - Conner. - That's what I said. - Conner. Yes, Carver, you can take the sofa. Let me get some decorations. Okay. I just... So many memories just coming back to me bein' here. To tell you, Lacey, my mama, she loved this place. She did. I'm so happy you all came back here to take care of it. Welcome. Well, my daughter's paying the mortgage... so I hope you bring in a crop this year. I told you not to buy this farm. That dam up north caused a lot of problems this year for the farmers. But Conner, he's got him a new strain of corn that takes less water. Now, how's that work, Conner? I studied agriculture at New York State. Is that where you two met? Yeah. He's brilliant. Gets it from his old man. Runs in the genes. At the science of it, not so much the farming. So genius, little Einstein, little Stephen Hawkins. We used to call him "Smarty Britches" when he was little. If you put some Viagra in that tree's water, it'll stay up all year. You better put some Viagra in your water. See what happen with your tree. - All right, let's decorate. - No, thank you. I can manage. I brought some decorations from Atlanta... and I work at one of the finest department stores... so I know a thing or two about taste. Where... Where did you get this tree? I mean, you have a beautiful Christmas tree... right outside the kitchen window and none in the house. What's wrong? Please don't tell me that's your granddaddy's tree. Oh, dear God. Mama, was there a yellow ribbon wrapped around that tree? Yes, and I cut it off. Excuse me. Excuse me. What happened? What? My mama planted that tree... in memory of my granddaddy. Well, how was I supposed to know that? This doesn't make any sense. Lacey. Did these people come when you bought this land? This is your land now. You can do what you want to with it. Excuse me. You don't look so good. Feeling a little light-headed. Well, sit down then. Sit down. Okay. It's all these strange people in this house, that's what it is. It ain't them people, it's you! Hell, you! You lost your damn mind. You done lost your damn mind! Anytime you see somebody with a yellow ribbon on the tree, Eileen... a yellow ribbon, that means a memoriam. Don't you know what that means? Everybody in the USA knows what a memoriam is... when you see a yellow ribbon on a damn tree. You work on my nerves. That poor woman is probably crying 'cause you cut down her daddy's tree. What wrong with you, cutting down her daddy's tree? You know what's gonna happen? I'm gonna make this plain. You're gonna go to bed, slip into a coma... and everybody gonna wonder what happened to you. I did it. It's Christmas, damn it! I don't know, Buddy. I don't think I can deal with this. I don't like it. It's wrong. I can't pretend to be somebody. I'm not an actress. I'm not Reba. Maybe we should just leave. Let's pack up and leave tomorrow. No, we're not going back home. We're staying here. - It's Christmas. - And that woman... she cuts down my daddy's memory tree and acts like she doesn't even care! Honey, I know. It stinks. I get it. You know what? We'll get you another tree. I want that tree. I want my daddy's tree. What about our son? Conner just stands there and doesn't say anything back to this woman. He's just pretending, just saying nothin' to this woman. Sweetheart, you know our kid. He can't tell no to anybody. Let him figure it out. - You want some of this? - No, not now. - You know you want some of this. - I don't. It's too much for me. Remember that game we played when we was kids? - Mystery Date? - No, the Ghost and the Damsel. - You remember that? - Buddy Williams... We are not playing... This is not the time or the place. Don't you dare. Go take a cold shower and get off of me. Go throw some milk on that thing. I think I left my bag in... one of my bags here. - You think she noticed me? - Yes! - Yes! - Oh, damn. How to stop diabetes before it starts. That's what AARP talking about. You got to read this, this is pretty good. - Hi. - Hey. Heard about the sponsorship? Yeah, just found out about it. - We got a problem. - What's that? Sponsor is Sheldon Construction. Same Sheldon Construction that built the dam that put us all out of business? - That's the one. - Hell no. You see? Unbelievable. Eileen, what you doin'? I knew it. He's in the Ku Klux Klan. What? He was wearing the sheet when I went in the room. Them people are not in no Ku Klux Klan. I saw the Klan today. That ain't the Klan. - They probably trying to make up the bed. - I know the Klan when I see it. There you go, overreacting, like you always do. - Yes, he is. - Always jump to conclusions. Stop jumping to conclusions. No, baby. No. I know what I saw. Eileen, you gonna get your pressure up. I'm gonna sleep with one eye open tonight. Yes. Oh, Lord, my poor daughter, she's so naive. She don't know what's going on. She don't have a clue. You don't have a clue, talkin' about sleeping with one eye open. I hope it's not the lazy one, 'cause that one always look closed. Them people are not in the Klan. You put all of this stuff in front of that door. All that stuff in front the damn door. I go to the bathroom, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 times a night... and if I laugh too hard, I squirt pee. You got to move that stuff. How can I go to the bathroom at night with all that in front the door? What this? - I can't sit on this cup! - Then stand up. Conner, I'm sorry. - Can I ask you something? - What's that? - Are you ashamed of me? - No. Then why won't you tell her? I've never let my mother down my entire life. Okay? I've done everything she wanted. Always. And this is the first time I've done something that I want. Conner, it's gonna break her heart. You gotta understand that. You have to understand how this makes me feel. I love you. I'm proud of us. I don't care who knows. - Are you coming to bed? - You mean the sofa, right? You know the walls are thin. My patience is getting there with this. And I told her, "You better get the hell on out the way." Lord, that was funny. Your mama was something else. Here you are, Miss Murphy. Three little eggs. Mama, it's fine. Would you like some coffee, Conner? No, I gotta tend to the animals. I can give you a few pointers if you want to. - Yeah, that would be great. - Okay, great. All right. I'll be outside if y'all need me. What kind of farmhand don't know about farmin'? - He knows the science of it, Mama. - No, I heard that last night. Wait. Why are you always defending him? 'Cause she like him. Over my dead body will she end up with somebody like that. Somebody like what? I don't wanna talk about it. We don't make those kind of jokes, okay? Hush up, Dragon Lady. Hush the hell up. If she like him, she like him. That's all that is. Just hush. Excuse me. Good morning, y'all. This room brings back so many memories. Smells like farm. Good morning, Miss Mandela. Not Mandela, honey. Madea. Madea, honey. Hi, sweetheart. Mrs. Williams, would you like some coffee? - I'm gonna get it myself. - Don't you have to go to school? Actually, I do. I'm on my way. I'll talk to you later. Bye, Miss Mandela. I had such a crazy, crazy-ass dream last night. - Really? - Yeah. What are you cooking? - Can I help? I'm good in the kitchen. - No, I don't need your help. Eileen! What? I don't need her help. I understand. I like to cook alone myself sometimes too. - Thank you. - All right then. - Thank you. - Okay. You oughta be ashamed of yourself. That ain't being Christian, being that mean to that woman. I don't eat food from the KKK. That woman ain't in no KKK. Hush that foolishness. Hell. - I love you, Son. - Love you too. Stay warm, okay? - Stop babying him. - You need to start babying him. What's the matter with you? You did not need to be so mean to that woman yesterday. She don't need to be coming around here. She seems nice. She just wants the best for Bailey. I know what's the best for Bailey, and that's keeping this place running. He can learn something in school. Maybe become something more than the two of us. Yeah? Well, school is gonna have to wait. Gotta get these "poinsetters" sold. Think I'm gonna go down to Harrisburg. Try sell 'em over there. If you would have talked to Lacey, you would've found out... that she has got sponsorship for the Jubilee, so it is happening. So you can sell your poinsettias at the Jubilee. - Who's the sponsor? - I don't know. Who does she think she is? What you mad for, huh? The Jubilee is happening. We don't need her help. She ain't from around here. - Well, that's just plain dumb. - You watch your back talk, Amber. And you watch your front talk, Tanner. - Hi. - Hey. Heard about the sponsorship? Yeah, just found out about it. - We got a problem. - What's that? Sponsor is Sheldon Construction. Same Sheldon Construction that built the dam that put us all out of business? - That's the one. - Hell no. You see? Unbelievable. There is no such thing as "just a farm boy." You are smart. You can be anything you want. I can only imagine if you could just stay awake in class. - Are you up late at night? - No, ma'am. I want you to sing the lead solo at the Christmas Jubilee. I'm sorry. I can't do that. - Yes, you can. - No. You know what? I really gotta go, Miss Williams. My daddy's gonna be waiting for me at home. Child, these nipples so tough, you need a mammogram. Don't look at me like that. - But you giving milk. - Well, hello. Hey there. - How are ya? - Thems pigs was starving to death. I slopped them, and I've been trying to get milk for Eileen. - She's in there trying to cook something. - Look, he's trying. - We sure do appreciate you helpin'. - No. That's fine. I'll show him how to do it when he come out of that laboratory thing. Look like he growing marijuana. He ain't growing marijuana, is he? No, he ain't doing that. Look, he's a smart kid, you know. He just, well... - What? - I'm a truck driver. I'm out on the road a lot, you know, and... he always stayed with his mom and his grandparents here. I tell you what, it broke my heart to be gone so much... but I just kind of feel a little guilty about the way he turned out. - How he turn out? - Kind of passive, I guess. Kind of lets people walk all over him. I mean, he used to get beat up a lot in school, bullied. - Oh, he's soft. - He's soft. This kid, Tanner, used to beat him up all the time. And he still lives here, that Tanner. When a person gets tired of a bully, they handle it, you understand? You shut it down and you realize that you ain't gonna deal with it no more. - Boy, that's the truth. - Gotta wait for that. Hey, we were just talking about you. - Yeah? - It was all good stuff. - All good stuff. - Good. That one, she just will not let you milk her. - The black-and-white one? - Yep. There's a reason why you couldn't get milk from the black-and-white one, son. If somebody pull on your testicles, will you give 'em milk? Don't answer that. That's a bull. You can't milk no bull. You serious, trying to milk a bull? Blessed. Son, you got to slop them pigs early in the morning. Then you gotta milk these cows 'cause they nipples is tough. And you can't be gentle. You got to pull them nipples. You got to pull them things. Pull 'em hard. Pull 'em. Pull 'em. Pull 'em. You're used to that. Hell, his mama breast-fed him until he was in ninth grade. Shut your mouth! Ninth grade? Her nipples ought to have corrosion. Yeah. That's right. You ought to see them things. They look like cake decorator bags. Dad, stop it. Come on. Y'all, sometimes I just think I'm not cut out for this. Well, hey, it's just a nipple! Daddy, I'm talking about farming. Well, hey, farming's hard, Son. Yes, farming's hard. You know what else is hard? Keeping up a lie... 'cause the longer you let it live, the harder it is to kill. - Ain't that right? - You got that right. You're a smart woman. - What are you talkin' about? - What am I talkin' about? I'm talking about you and Lacey. You wanna tell Eileen, or you want me to tell her y'all together? - Daddy! - Hey, I didn't say nothin'. - Who told you? - You just did. Whole body language. Tensed up. When I walked in the house the other day, I saw them shoes. I see the way you look at her, the way she look at you. - Y'all need to say something. - It's not me. I wanna tell her. It's Lacey. She says she doesn't think she can handle it. We just need a defibrillator. She gonna have a heart attack. She gonna clutch the pearls and die. But we'll get a defibrillator. She'll be all right. But it's all right. Y'all just dating. Dating? They're married. Oh, she dead. Flatline. Just... Dead. Lord have mercy, that's going to kill her. Lacey said she's gonna tell her on Christmas. She fixin' to kill her mama on Christmas Day? - What kind of Christmas present is that? - Oh, damn. Y'all better have some nitroglycerin or something. That's a damn shame. Gonna kill that woman on... Hell, I'm stuck in the mud. Hell, this ain't mud! - You all right? - I done fell in bull... Keep going. Help each other out. - Hi. What's going on? - It's bad. Oliver called and told the mayor... that we couldn't have any references to the nativity or Jesus. - What? - The sponsors don't want it. No. No, something is wrong. I'll call him. Well, the mayor wants to see you now. - Come on. - Okay. Who does he think he is? All right! That's enough! That's enough! One at a time! I'm very upset. She is trying to take Christ out of Christmas. Next thing you know they'll wanna take prayer out of church! You see what happened when they took prayer out of schools. We did. Wilbur, what does it say? Well, the contract says... no nativity. No Jesus reference whatsoever. Not even a little drummer boy. Unbelievable. Why didn't it say that the first time you read it? Well, it was in the small print. I didn't have my glasses on. I didn't have my glasses on! I couldn't see! - This is awful! - Wait. This has got to be a mistake. Let me call Oliver. How about that? All righty. You go right ahead. I've already talked to him about this, but have at it. Okay. - Put it on speaker. - Yeah. Okay. Hello? - Hi Oliver. - Hey. Guess you talked to the mayor. Yes, we are all here on speakerphone. Yeah, I don't see what the big deal is. They want it to be called Holiday Jubilee instead of Christmas. Yeah, and they don't need references to religious figures. How do we talk about Christmas without talking about Jesus? - Yeah, how do we? - It happens all the time, Santa Claus is okay. Make it about Santa Claus and not about the birth of Christ. And the songs for the Jubilee should be about everything but Christ. Sing songs like Here Comes Santa Claus, White Christmas. White Christmas. There ain't nothing white about a Bucktussle, Alabama Christmas! - It don't snow here! - That's right. Okay, Oliver, we did not sign up for this. Okay? Yes, you did. I am a Christian, and this is some bull... The heads of the company are coming down on a private jet... A private jet. To be filmed with the school at the Jubilee, I did you a favor here, and this will ruin me. You can't do this to me now. I can't just turn them around. You have to figure this one out. - You hold on there, son. - That's right. You get it straight. With all due respect, Mr. Mayor, you got the money and we have a deal. - Give him his money back. - Yeah. - We spent it. - Yeah. - On what? - The Jubilee! And much-needed school supplies. And catching up on school bills. Listen, I'm sorry, but we're coming. This is my career you're talking about. I'll see you tomorrow. Move, move. Now, watch out. Well, now this is a fine mess you've gotten us into. She should be fired. - Now hold on a second. - Mr. Mayor... have you heard? We were talking about the changes they want made. That's not what I was talking about. I was talking about the sponsor. - Sheldon Construction. - What? That's right. The same folks... that built a dam to save Jasper and left us without a river. She brought this mess here and she should be fired. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring... We don't care what the hell you meant. Do we? - No. - I didn't think so. You brought an awful situation here. Get out of here and let us handle it. - Go back to wherever you come from. - Now hold on. You do not have to talk to her like that. Mr. Mayor. You fire her. Right now. Do it. - Lacey, I'm sorry. - There we go. I understand. You believe that? Sheldon. This is a hell of a mess. You all do your homework, okay? And... be good for your new teacher. Where are you going? I made a mistake... and now I have to leave. No. I'll sing. I'll do the solo. I don't think there's gonna be a Christmas Jubilee this year. I don't want you to go. Bailey, you are so special. You always remember that. - Okay? - Yes, ma'am. You all are. I'll see you. - I'm so sorry. - It's fine. Good job, boys. I just got done telling Madea... that you was in here all alone with Eileen, and she said that... I said you was in here with the beast of the southern wild. I tried. That woman is stubborn. I tried. I asked her if I could help her cook. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Yeah, I know. She's difficult. It's all right. She got a problem, but it's all right. - Y'all want some lemonade? - No, I'm good. - I'm good. Thank you. - There you are. I've been worried about you. You were out there with them for a while. Yeah. I was conflicted. I didn't know if I should look for you or watch the food. I didn't let her near our food. You whisper like a damn bullhorn. That woman ain't gonna hurt us. We don't know that, do we? What y'all talking about over there? She just thinks y'all are tryin' to kill us. - Tryin' to kill you? - Good heavens! - You're nuts! - I've never hurt a flea or a fly. I've seen her shoot a deer once though. I never. I would never shoot little Bambi sipping water in a pond. I'm just gonna ask y'all. I'm gonna put it out on the table. - Be honest. - What is it? Y'all in the Ku Klux Klan? - That's what she wanna know. - Get outta here! Heavens no. Why would she... - Buddy, the other night with the sheet. - Oh, with the sheet! Yes! Explain that. We used to play this game, all right? Buddy and I, when we were young, he would... It was called the Ghost and the Damsel. And he would blindfold me. Then he'd put a sheet above himself... and then I would have to search about... and capture the rapture, if you know what I mean. Mama! I am sorry, Conner. - That's just nasty. - Sorry, Son. - But I like it. - I know. It can be fun. It can be. That is so inappropriate. You two need to learn how to respect my daughter's house. - Eileen, you might wanna let that go. - No. They come in here taking advantage of her... eating her food, and they're acting like they own the place. - I don't like it. - You need to let that go. Well, I don't like... - Mama... - that you... Mama, sit down. You cut down my family's memory tree. That's what I don't like. Excuse me? I can deal with a lot of things. They know it. But this is downright wrong... and now I am getting very upset! Why would you plant his memory tree on my daughter's land... and how was I supposed to know that? Oh, I don't know. Maybe because it had a yellow ribbon around it? That doesn't mean anything. In most countries, in most places, to sane-thinking people... a yellow ribbon means something. Now you just calm down, missy. Okay? Now, Lacey, are you gonna let her talk to me like this? - Mama, calm down. - Put your finger down... or I will cut it off and deep-fry it! You need to leave my daughter's house. - Mama, stop it! Stop! - No! Eileen, you need to stop right now, honey. What are they doing here anyway? Tomorrow is Christmas! They are not your family! - Let's get out of here. - No, hold up. Come on back here. Ain't nobody going nowhere. - Now, Madea... - Ain't nobody goin' no damn where. Madea, whose side are you on? - Let 'em leave. - No, I'm on the side of right. - That's the side I'm on. Lacey? - Yes. - Tell your mama. - What? Tell me what? Spit it out before I punch you, put your teeth down your throat! Mama... Conner and I are married. - Catch her. - Get the defibrillator. Lacey. Your father. I know, Mama. I know he was murdered by a white man, but... - What happened? - What? My father was killed by a white man on Christmas Eve... trying to protect my mother's honor. - That's awful. - Good Lord. - Who told you that? - Mama. Eileen, you oughta be ashamed... Child, that's some straight-up bull... Madea! Your daddy wasn't killed by no white man. He left your mama for a white woman when you was two... and your mama has been bitter with white people ever since. - What? - Yes, years ago. Ran off and joined the circus. And now they on Glee, Good show. Glee? Mama, is this true? Mama! Lacey, I am so disappointed in you. Look at her trying to turn it around on you. Girl, please. You're disappointed in me? Well, that went well. At least she didn't have another heart attack. - Another one? - Yeah, Madea. Didn't you know that my mother had a heart attack last year? Your mama lied to you. She had gas. Got to the doctor, she was clutching her heart and the pearls. Got there, doctor say it's gas. - Wait, what? - They put one of them rods up there. Came flowing out like the River Jordan and that was it. It was all over. I had that once too. Put it in there, come out sounding like brakes coming out of... The air pressure coming out of one of them big rigs. There it is. Then they tell her she had heartburn. - She didn't have no heart attack. - She had heartburn? She needs some of that Prilosec OTC. She been manipulating you. She as healthy as an ox. Well, that woman's a pretty pissed off ox. Don't get behind her. Don't light a match. Don't get her next to an open flame. We'll all have burnt heads. Yeah, her farts can spell her name, they so bad. - Mama, he got her fired. - That's all right. I'm upset too. We should go, boy. We got work to do. Why'd you do that to Mrs. Williams? You know, she's a nice lady. Why'd you get her fired? You don't know what's going on here, Bailey. I know you don't like people 'cause of the way they look. That ain't right! That's what kids do to me at school! It ain't fair. She's nice to me. Don't you ever... talk to me like that again. You hear me? Get out on that plow. He is right, and you know it. She made a deal with the devil. No, you're actin' more like the devil than she is. And this is Christmas, Tanner. This child still sitting out there. That's just crazy as hell. Where y'all going? Well, Miss Media, we're gonna bring her... My name is Madea, honey. - Madea. - Thank you. We're gonna bring her hot chocolate to warm her hard, hard heart. Hot chocolate does wonders. It's delicious. That's what got y'all in trouble, the hot chocolate. Your son with the hot chocolate. I'm telling you. Let me explain something to you. Let me make this clear to y'all. Leave her out there. She is grown, sitting there. If she want to come in the house, she know how to get in. Leave her alone. We're gonna go out and try. We'll talk to her a bit. Go on. Go on. Okay. You better wear a cup. That's comforting. Boy, this is something else, isn't it? It's freezing. Remember, Buddy, kill her with kindness. My weenie is an inny right now. Try to have as much charm with your voice as you do with your weenie. Well, tell you what. I ain't used to this cold weather. I know. All right? I'm gonna have to wipe with an ice scraper tonight. Smile's all in patience. Ask the Lord. Lord, help us. The Serenity Prayer. There ain't no cabs out here. You wanna come back in the house? I'm fine right here. I made you some pipin' hot chocolate. Thank you. I don't want any chocolate. My son likes chocolate. Go ahead and laugh. This is awful. What's so awful about it? What world are you living in? They are asking for trouble. Eileen, I... Mrs. Murphy to you. Miss Murphy, you can take a knife and cut all three of us right now. You know what's gonna happen? We're gonna bleed red. Blood red. We're all the same inside. That's true. Mrs. Murphy, if I may... our children, no matter what we think, they will live their own lives. - The world is changing. - Not that much. It is changing, and that is a good thing. Every generation sees a little less division... and a little more open minds and open hearts. I think we should be happy and proud... that our kids, our children... see people as people. That was beautiful. - That was unbelievable. - Thank you. I mean it. Come in the house and get to know us. We're good folks. I know damn well you hear me calling you. Eileen! Traitor! - Satan! - Judas! Beelzebub! Come in. It is cold. You got these people out here trying to tempt you back in the house... like a wet cat on a cold Sunday morning who needs some milk. Come in the house. You're out here freezing. Your ankles is whiter than snow. Look like you been kicking flour. My gosh, they are white. Look, we are related. I will not step into that house of lies. The girl is married. You can't control every minute of her life. Do you understand? It is Christmas. Give this child the gift of being able to do whatever she want to do. You can't run her life for her. Do you understand that? Ain't no cab comin'. You gonna be sitting out here freezin'. We gonna come out here tomorrow, you gonna be a black Statue of Liberty... just sitting down on your ass. Come on in the house! You know what? That's fine. You don't want to come in 'cause you mad about something? You can't get everything your way. You ever woke up on Christmas morning and didn't get the gift you wanted? This is it. You didn't get the gift you wanted. Bring your ass in the house. Y'all wastin' your time, 'cause she stubborn as a mule. I'm going in. You wanna sit out here and freeze, sit your ass out here... sit your ass out here and freeze! Sit there as long as you want. I don't give a damn. Sit there and turn into a damn Popsicle! Freeze all the hell you want. You done lost your damn mind! Amen. Come on inside. You'll freeze to death. Ain't no cab coming. - I can't believe that. - We tried our best. Let's go in and play charades with Madea. Then I will walk to town. And I'll take the Greyhound bus. I don't need none of them. Not one of them. Hey. Your mama's still out in the cold. You may want to talk to her. - She doesn't want to talk to me. - You sure about that? I know my mother. Apparently you don't know her as well as you think. And what's that supposed to mean? She's been manipulating you your entire life. She lied to you about your daddy and about her heart attacks. It's just not right. Can you stop talking about my mother now? I'm not talkin' about your mother. I'm just statin' the obvious. I'm not trying to attack you or her. Good, because I've been attacked enough today. Between my mother and my job and... It's just all a bit much. And everybody's mad at me because of the sponsor... I didn't know it was from Sheldon Construction Company. Tanner McCoy. Yeah, okay. - What about Tanner? - Nothing. - Baby. - I said "nothing." What did Tanner do? He was so nasty. And then he got me fired. - Conner. - Son of a bitch. Conner, where are you going? - Hey, what's going on? - I mentioned Tanner and he lost it. - Conner! - I've been waiting to see this. - I'm goin' with you, boy. - Conner! Conner! Hot dog, it's cold out here. It's all right. It's all right then. Help! What in the... Oh, Jesus, no, you don't. - Hey. - Someone there? Hello? I'm here. I can't move. All right now. We gotta get outta here. Come on. - I'm stuck. - Can you move your... My leg's caught. I don't wanna die. - Nobody's gonna die. - I have a little boy. Push. I got you. Got it. Go ahead. I got you. You're good. How are your legs? Okay. - How's your head? - All right. All right. Get up. Get up. Help. Help. Get off my mother-in-law, you son of a bitch! - Hey! Don't hurt him! Stop it! - Leave him be! Come on! Don't you ever, ever say a word to my wife again. You understand me? - What did he say about Lacey? - Get in the truck. I will not step foot back in that house! I am not in the mood for your foolishness. Now get your ass in that truck! Now I'm plantin' corn... and there ain't a damn thing you can do about it. Get out of here. Babe, I wish you wouldn't have done that. It had to be done. Nothing stops somebody like him from bullying people except pushing back. That's right. That kid's been a terror to Conner since he was a little boy. I'm glad you done what you did, Son. I'm proud of you. Stood up for himself, and that's a good thing. I'm with you, Lacey. I don't like it. I just wanna tell you all how sorry I am. I should have told my mom from the beginning. That is the truth. You should've told her. We have met your mama and we understand. She crazy as hell. Didn't I tell you? - She's cuckoo. - That's right. I don't like you all talking about me. No, Mrs. Murphy, I'm sorry. We were just saying that God makes everyone different... and you are a gem in God's ring. And I don't like the way you spoke to me. Well, I'm sorry. I was angry. - What did you say? - He told her to get her ass in the truck. - And what did you do? - She got her ass in the truck. Go ahead and laugh. Hold on, Eileen. Y'all need to let all this go. You lied. She done lie. Everybody lied. Here a lie, there a lie. It's Christmas now. You need to go down there and buy her a tree. And plant it in the backyard. Get her a ribbon. - A yellow one. - I'm sorry. I just wanted to give my daughter a proper wedding. Mama, you've always been overbearing. I did it for me. Not for you. I love you, and I'm sorry... that I didn't tell you, but this is my life. And he loves me, and he treats me oh so well. I'm sorry. I just didn't want you to get hurt. Mama, he's not gonna hurt me. He's as gentle as a lamb. No, he's not. He beat that man down to the ground. Come on. That guy had it comin', and everybody knows it. Well, he did say he was protecting you. I love your daughter, Miss Murphy. I'll never let anything happen to her. I promise. That makes two of us. Okay. Well, this is all new to me. I don't know, but... I'll try. Nothing beats a failure but a try. - Now we're making some progress. - Yeah. A try's a try, right? Oh, boy. That's Tanner. That's trouble. He's still got it. I knew you got it in you. - Now, don't. - Baby... You get off my property, Tanner McCoy, before I knock you on your ass again. - Give him a chance. - He's just coming here to start trouble. - No, he's not. - I want to apologize. - What? - I want to... say thank you. - I'm sorry. I didn't get your name. - Eileen. Miss Eileen. He told me what you did for him. So... thank you. Oh, thank you! He really is a good man. He's just been so troubled... with all that's been going on with the dam. Thank you. Tanner, I've been working on a new strain of corn... that doesn't need as much water. I could use your help with it. Yeah. I'd be glad to. I'm sorry I wanted to get you fired. I'm gonna talk to the mayor tomorrow. Promise. I'm sure he's still very upset. Having to choose between going on with Jubilee or getting sued... is pretty crazy. The town's going on with it, but we're not happy... about not being able to say Jesus or celebrate his birth. You know, Bailey's been practicing... and all the kids are really sad. Yeah, I've been thinking about that, and I have an idea. Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way - We are live... - Look at all the news vans. This old town has never had this much attention. Well, since the whorehouse closed down in 1970. - That was a sad day. - What do you think about the celebration? Well, I say Christmas is about Jesus. I ran down here. I ran for my life! 'Cause I was gonna start a fire. "O Lord Jesus is a fire." Ain't nobody got time for that. - Hell no. - Hold on there. - We need to shut this down. - Just wait a sec. See what she's got to say. I told them to hide the kids, hide they wife... and hide they Santa Claus, 'cause it's crazy around here. Thank you so much. This is lovely. I got a candy apple. Where y'all went? Merry Christmas. How you doing? Where y'all went? There they is, over there. Hey, Oliver, how ya doin'? Good to see you. Good to see you. All right, all right. Listen, listen, we have a contract. You see those people over there? They are very powerful. You have to take down the nativity. Okay, that's it. May I have everyone's attention? What is she doing? Hello, Bucktussle. I want to thank you all for coming out to the Christmas Jubilee. - Look at your daughter. - Isn't she beautiful? I'd also like to thank Sheldon Construction Company... for sponsoring this Christmas celebration. Christmas is about giving back, and with all the world watching... not only did Sheldon Construction Company fund this event... but they've also agreed to release... 150,000 gallons of water a day down the river to the farmers. Thank you. - What are you doing? - Giving goodwill towards men. - Thank you, Mr. Sheldon. - She's smart. - I told you. - Aren't you glad you didn't do anything? - You care about getting back... - Yeah. To the heart of who we are as people. You are so proud to be a part of a town... that doesn't mind keeping the Christ in Christmas... so much so, that they are presenting the McCoy School... with $100,000 a year for the next four years. - Yeah! Yes! - Yes, yes! Such a fantastic Christmas gift to the city, sir. - Can you give us a comment? - So without further ado... let the Christmas Jubilee begin. Come on. Well, hello, Bucktussle, and welcome... welcome to the Christmas Jubilee and Fair. The children of McCoy School... have put together a little presentation for us all... and this has all been under the direction of their current teacher... May be wrong for that. I am so proud of the kids. Mrs. Lacey Williams. - Did she say, "Mrs. Lacey Williams"? - It was all her idea. - Yep, she did. - So, thank you, Lacey, for everything. And now the children of McCoy School, featuring Bailey McCoy. That's my boy! Mary, did you know That your baby boy Would give sight to the blind man? Mary, did you know - That your baby boy - Hey, baby. - Let's go. - Let's go. Would calm a storm with his hand? Did you know That your baby boy Has walked where angels trod And when you kiss your little baby You have kissed the face of God? Mary, did you Know? You don't need to have no lingerie on. Eileen, tell him we've been shopping at Tifton's for over 15 years. Yes, okay. I'm gonna help her. Okay, go help her. Fifteen years. Well, 15 years ago maybe that lingerie worked. But now the lingerie don't work, honey. You are so insulting! I am not insulting. I am telling you the truth. You shouldn't have on no damn lingerie. I'm trying to save you some embarrassment. Put on that damn lingerie, look like you got hair damage on your ass. I mean, come on now. Come on, honey. I'm trying to help y'all. - Is this good? - There you go trying to control everything. - I am not trying to... - Let me get the lines clean. Let me get the eye lines clean... 'cause I got a single on me and a single on you. And Maysie's sitting in the editing room right now cussing... 'cause we're talking all over each other. Lacey, you do not have a Christmas tree! - Mama. - What? No, really! That's why you wanted me here... - Yup, that's exactly why. - I'll clean up and straighten out. I'm gonna take this room. Let me go straighten up a little. - Then we'll go... - She talks so much. - Is this one yours, Madea? - All right, come on. What you talking about? You just talking all over everybody. - Hi. - Look, they do it in unison. They all do it in unison. That's nice. Unison is nice. The unison is very nice. You tryin' to correct me? I say it's "u-nis-on." No, Aunt Madea. So I have a meeting down the hall... Any unison when they sang unison. No, ma'am, it's not. But that's fine. That's okay. I have a meeting down the hall... I thought it was "unison", and "a cappollo." When they sang in no music, what is that? No music? Yeah, when you sang and there ain't no music, ain't that a "cappollo"? No, that's a cappella. I don't know much about music. Me and Ike Turner didn't make it. He went on with Tina. That's okay. That's okay. I would beat the hell out of him. Ike wasn't gonna put his hands on me. That's all I'm saying. I'm sorry. Say what you're saying to the children. - Are you done? Okay. - Yes! I have a meeting down the hall... You ain't getting testy with me, are you? Talkin' about "Are you done?" - No, of course not. - Okay. Let's start over from the top, 'cause that's gonna make it in the gag reel. Speed. - White lightning? - Yeah, moonshine. You want to take a snort? Nope, I'll pass. Boy, it'll put some hair on your chest, I'll guarantee ya. Stop it. Come on. Talk about hair on your chest. I could French-braid his. That's right. I could put a little bow on it. She's too pretty to have hair on her chest. Really. I gotta tell you, I got rid of mine. Little bat hairs attached to needles... soaked in cucumber juice and a boatload of Nair. Gone, like that, if you ever have a problem with... I've seen a mosquito so daggone big... it was dry-humping a wiener dog right there on the porch. She's way prettier than the last one. She looked like... Tyler Perry. Boy, I tell you what, Son, she's way prettier... than that last girl you was with. Good night. She looked like old Tyler Perry. All right. Keep going. Oh, my God. Where are my manners? I'll do one it one more time. Ready? Where are my manners? But this'un, you done good on this'un. Shut the... I need to introduce myself, but where are my manners? I am... - All right. - It's okay, Mama. I know. It's gonna roll at the end of the movie. All right. I'm a truck driver. Been out on the road a lot. Long-haul truck driver. You run long hos? No, long haul. Oh, haw, like haw. - Hauling. - Oh, hauling. Like your eucalyptus. Menthol. "Hall." Haul. Not "hole." Haul. - A hole, a haul, okay. - But anyway... he still lives here, that Tanner. Kid's still beating him up? Yeah, he's still beating him up. The little kid? He's too big for that. No, he's big now. He's a regular-sized kid. I mean, he growed with... He growed with Conner. Tanner, he's regular size. He ain't like a dwarf or nothin'. - He growed? - Yeah, he growed up that tall. He ain't a dwarf. I mean, shoot, he'd take a dwarf. He'd kick ass out of a dwarf. Hell, I hope so. It's just regular-sized kids he got trouble with. - Okay. Okay. - But he's good in the dwarf department. I need a dictionary to keep up with you sometime, honey. If you're gonna do it, then you need to do it and keep doin' her... and then when you're done doin' her, you keep doin' her again... 'cause you wanna keep doin' what it is you need to do... in order to do what you need to be doin'. Ain't that right? She told you that lie too? She didn't have no damn heart attack. She had gas. We got her to the hospital, they said she had gas. What? They ran one of them pipes in there, she farted, it was over. Yeah, she had gas. She had gas. She had gas. They hit her in the stomach real hard and she farted. It was over. Then she had heartburn. Sounds like she needs some Prilosec OTC. Get out my way! I don't need to be here in this stuck-up-ass... bougie-ass store nowhere. I don't need to be up in there with y'all! Go to hell! Where's my damn car? Where's my damn car? Shut the hell up. Cut.
