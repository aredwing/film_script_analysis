Yes, I heard your song and I like it very much. Could you come in, say, around 4:00? Fine. You're welcome. - Look, excuse me... - Just a moment, please. I asked... I'm sorry about that. - Sorry. - That's quite all right. I have a song that is just wonderful for you. I told Mr. Rossiter yours is the voice that can do it justice. I'll bet you tell that to all the customers. Of course I do, but in your case, it's true. All right, then. Shine on Shine on Harvest moon up in the sky I ain't had no lovin' Since January, February, June or July Snow time ain't no time to stay Outdoors and spoon So shine on, shine on Harvest moon For me and my gal That's lunch. Let's eat someplace where they don't have any music. You may as well stand still. I can beat you to that door too. - Who are you? - Look, all I want is five minutes. - Read them. - What are these? Song lyrics and poems and an operetta, and underneath that, two musical comedies. I want an opinion. - You want an opinion. - That's all. Well, I am going to give you one. You are, without a doubt, the most persistent young man that I've ever met. Now, get yourself a haircut, make an appointment, and come back. And for heaven's sake, wear a tie. Are you gonna publish my songs or my tie? Now, wait a minute. Do you know what this is? Four years of working nights after wrestling with crockery all day long... ...and nobody to tell me if they're good. Today, I made up my mind to find out. Please. But I just work here. Why don't you take these to Mr. Rossiter? I'm having a tough enough time. How could I see your boss? I'm very sorry, but this is my lunch hour and... Well, be my guest. Salami on pumpernickel, homemade pumpernickel. You couldn't do better at the Palmer House. Believe me, you'll enjoy them. I'll get you a drink. There. Are they all about William Howard Taft and the Statue of Liberty? Anything wrong? Don't you ever write about simple things? Things that you know and you feel? - You don't like them, huh? - I didn't say that. But I wouldn't wanna sit on a boy's lap... ...and have him sing about Washington crossing the Delaware. What's that got to do with it? Do you know why you write a popular song? Let me explain. Because most boys and girls don't know how to say "I love you." So you've got to say it for them, in 32 bars of music, no more, no less. Just like that. Who are you to make new rules? If a song is good, people will sing it, no matter what. - You asked for my opinion. - All right, so I made a mistake. You'd probably turn down "The Star-Spangled Banner"... ...if it didn't say "I love you by the dawn's early light." Two salami sandwiches down the drain. At least you've had your lunch. Thirty-two bars of music to say "I love you." What if I said, "I hate you"? They could shoot me? What am I talking to you for? You don't understand. Nobody understands. I hope I haven't discouraged you. What's four years' work? For that which we are about to receive... ...we thank the William Rossiter Music Company. - Oh, now, Father. - Well, it's true. My daughter earns as much at that great citadel of culture as I do teaching school. If it bothers you, Father, I'll have them cut my salary. That isn't what bothers me. It's the type of person you have to associate with. And the grossness of their nature will have weight to drag thee down. Father thinks they're not fit for a nice girl, dear. But he hasn't even met one of them. And if he did, he'd like them. They're sensitive musicians and composers and poets... ...in spite of what Father thinks. - I'll see who it is. - Oh, thanks. Your trouble is you shouldn't have had a daughter. You should have had a marble statue. Quite right, my dear. Only, we didn't know how to go about it. Coming. - A guy could freeze to death. - What are you doing here? I called your office. They gave me your address. Nice of them. You know, after I left you this morning, I got to thinking about what you said. - So I did it. - Did what? The lyric. You know, simple, what I feel. Here, read it, Ms. LeBoy. - What's your name? - Gus. Gus Kahn. Well, Mr. Kahn, we happen to be having our dinner. If you bring that to the office, I'll be happy to look at it. It's very cold and I walked a long way. Look at it now. - Who is it, dear? - Just a young man I met at the office. - Bring him into the dining room. - He has to leave, Mother. I don't have to leave. I'd like to come in. - We'll be in in a minute. - All right, dear. Don't you ever wear a tie? What's with you and ties? You'd think I was naked. Wait here. I'll get one of my father's. You and my mother are the same. Ties, ties. Worried about ties. Hold still. I'll put this on. You didn't have your hair cut either. Maybe you could get me one of your father's. Come on. This is Mr. Kahn. He's a lyric-writer. I am not a bit surprised. There is about him the unmistakable aura of the poet. - How do you do, Mr. Kahn? - How do you do? You'll excuse us... Oh, I suppose you've had your dinner? I could eat. Bring Omar Khayym his loaf of bread and jug of wine. The name's Gus, and if it's all the same to you, I'll have soup. - Bring Gus his soup. - Why, yes. Yes, indeed. I had no idea Mr. Kahn was coming tonight. I'm a little embarrassed. Oh, think nothing of it, my dear. You're the only one who Is. - I hope I'm not busting in or anything. - No apologies, Mr. Kahn. - Genius is its own excuse. - Father, please. Tell me, what has the muse inspired you to today? If you mean what did I write, I just knocked out a love song. Beautifully put. Father, I've read Mr. Kahn's work. And if he's written a love song, I'm sure it is beautiful. I can't think of anything the world needs more than a new love lyric. After all, Shelley and Keats have been going downhill for some time... ...and who couldn't knock out something better than Elizabeth Barrett Browning's: How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth And breadth and height My soul can reach, When feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace. I love thee to the level of every day's Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight. Could I have the rest of it? Wring out my tie, Mr. Kahn, and I'll continue. Gosh, I'm sorry. Oh, gosh. Gosh, l... Please, would you go on? I love thee freely, as men strive for right. I love thee purely, As they turn from praise. I love thee with a passion put to use In my old griefs, And with my childhood's faith. I love thee with a... I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath Smiles, tears, of all my life; And, if God choose I shall but love thee better after death. Excuse me. Father. Mr. Kahn. Mr. Kahn, I want to apologize. What for? He's right. What's a mug like me doing with a pencil? But nobody expects you to write like that. Express yourself in your own way, Mr. Kahn. And if you can make others feel what you feel, that's poetry. Some people are meant to write poems. Some people are meant to move crockery. I wouldn't expect my horse to get up on the seat and start driving. Good night. I'm sorry if I've troubled you. Well, what about the lyric you walked through the snow with? Have yourself a laugh. "Gee, I wish that I had a girl like the other fellows have." Gracie, look at these figures. "Smiling Through," 450,000 copies already. It was an inspiration you had to let John McCormack introduce it. I wanna talk to you about something. You don't have to. Without a word, I'm raising your salary $5 a week. Get back to work on the two dogs we are trying to push. - Mr. Rossiter. - What? I've written a song. It happens every time. Every good demonstrator wants to be a bad songwriter. But this is a wonderful lyric I ran across, just crying for a tune. Better it should cry than me. No, Gracie, look. How many good songs do we have lying in the catalog... ...that die because they've not been plugged? And how many bad songs have you yourself helped to become hits? Now, Gracie, believe me, to me, you are a much greater artist than Victor Herbert. I'll make that a $ 10-a-week raise. - Don't you even wanna hear the song? - No. I might like it. Then I'll take it someplace else, because this song has to be published. But you can't go to another publisher while you work for me. I don't work for you anymore, Mr. Rossiter. Then you don't get that raise. I'm sorry, Ms. LeBoy. I just can't do it. But you wouldn't have to pay us very much for the song. Say $ 10? You say it. Business is so bad, I can't say anything. We don't care. We'll work just for royalties. We'll work night and day and do our own plugging. What's this "we"? Who's the silent partner in this deal? - Mr. Kahn, the lyricist. - Where is he, in hiding? I don't know. I haven't seen him since he gave me the lyric. That's why I've got to have this song published. I don't follow. Then I'd have reason to see him again. Mr. Townsend, would it cost me very much to have a few copies printed? - Go on, play the number. - Thank you. Oh, what can I lose? I'm in receivership now. Hurry, before they come and take the piano. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth And breadth and height My soul can reach I love thee purely, As they turn from praise. I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs Who is opening the door? And with my childhood's faith. Me. Like always. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath Please come in. - Smile, tears... - Gus, it's for you. A girl. - Mr. Kahn. - Ms. LeBoy. Excuse me for being so forward, but I just had to come and congratulate you. - For what? - For this. - When did this happen? - I put a tune to it that same night. What'd you do that for? Let me see. "Lyrics by Gus Kahn." Gus, your name, printed. What's the matter? Couldn't your father have lived to see this? Ma, it's just a song. It's not the Declaration of Independence. How could you understand it? Five years old you were when we came to this country. But your father and I, how long we struggled with the language. Me, I'm still struggling. But my son, he makes a song out of it. Gee, if it means that much to you, I'm glad she did it. - Thanks, Ms. LeBoy. - Gus! This is the way how you treat a lady visitor? You should have some strudel with us. - Oh, yes. - Thank you very much. - Sit down. - And coffee. My mother makes the best strudel in town. You should excuse the dishes. But if a little bit is chipped off, he gets it free from the warehouse. Gus, I forgot, some more saucers we need. Okay, Ma. I'll chip some tomorrow. Mr. Kahn, you're not going back to the warehouse after writing a song like this. Well, why not? I promised the publisher we'd do our own plugging. - Plugging? - Get the song heard and played. It takes 24 hours a day, Mr. Kahn. You mean you want me to quit my job? But this is your big chance. What if the song doesn't go over? Who's gonna help pay the rent? Listen to him with the rent. Who paid the rent while you were growing up? And what are your brothers, pushcart peddlers? Believe me, we won't starve. - And there'll always be strudel. - Yup. She's very sweet. She gets so excited. Ma, what are you excited about? When I walk down Michigan Boulevard, people should say: "There goes the mother of Gus Kahn, the songwriter." Not "The mother of Gus Kahn who chips dishes for Albert Pick and Company." Now what are you doing? - Please. - What's that for? I would like to buy the first one. Here. Mrs. Kahn, I'd love to play it for you sometime. What for? Gus didn't write the music. Come on, now. Everybody sing. Gee, I wish that I had a girl Like the other fellows had Someone to make a fuss over me To cheer me up when I feel sad On Wednesday night, I'm all alone When I ought to be up At some sweetheart's home And I'm lonesome Awful lonesome Gee, I wish I had a girl Follow the pointer! - How do you do, Mr. Kahn? - It's raining like a son of a gun. Where are the folks? Oh, they're out. They're both out. They'll be out for quite a while. Good, we can get right to work. And, boy, do we need it. We've written quite a few songs, but we've had only one hit. That's not exactly a career. It's nothing against you, but we've gotta dig a little harder. I've written two new lyrics. Take a look, one of them could be a real good song. - Do we have to start right away? - Sure. What else is there to do? - What could I have been thinking of? - What? Oh, nothing. All right. Sit down. Sit down. There's two of them. One, I like a little better than the other. Here's "Love in Springtime." And this one is "The Month of June is a Song of Love." You know, June is the month of love. Everybody... Everybody gets married in June, and that's the whole idea. Now, let's try the verse, huh? "Every lassie loves a laddie in the month of June." Yeah. Mind if I move these? They're in the way. All right, go ahead. The first two lines. Now, the third line is "Mid..." Why have you got it so dark in here? How do you expect us to work in the dark? Holy smoke. There, that's better. Go ahead. From the third line. "Mid the roses..." "Mid the roses, man proposes, for the world's in tune." From "mid the roses," right from there, from the third line. - "Mid the roses, man proposes..." - Yeah, right from there. Play it. See what you hear from that. - What is that? What do you got on? - Real perfume, Nuit d'Amour. Yeah. Awfully stuffy in here. Do you mind if I open a window? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Gee, I had no idea it was blowing like that. Let's try it right from the top, huh? Right from the top. Good, good. Good. Gosh, that's good. That's wonderful. I wish your folks would go out every night. We'd get a lot done. That's real good. Try it again. Oh, that's a beautiful melody, Mr. Van Alstyne. Here's the surprise. I've talked Bert into letting Gus do the lyric. - I like his work. - It'll be a great break for Gus. Bert works with none but the best. You know his hits: "Shade of the Old Apple Tree," "I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark." Let's not go through the whole catalog. I had a feeling he wasn't here just to tune the piano. - Now, Grace. - You think I'm holding Gus back. Yeah. Not only me, but the whole music business. After all, Grace, I deserve another hit. I've been publishing all your flops. You've made up your mind, even before you've heard my new tune? If I'd made up my mind sooner, I'd have saved myself a lot of money. You've got him as a husband. Why hang onto him as a partner? Mr. Kahn and I are not married. What? But I've seen you together for years. I took it for granted. Grace, do you mean to say he never even asked you? He's cleared his throat once or twice, but that's as far as he's gotten. Well, why don't we forget about the whole thing? I think Gus and Grace should stick together. I'll leave the music here. We can get hold of another lyricist. Mr. Van Alstyne... - Am I late, Fred? - No. Come in, Gus. Come in. - You know Bert Van Alstyne. - By reputation, and I wish I had it. Hello. Did you played the new tune for Fred? I'm a little anxious to hear it myself. - Well, so long, everybody. - Oh, just a minute. Mr. Van Alstyne has a beautiful tune he wants you to write up. Well, I'm flattered, but Ms. LeBoy and l... Oh, I think you should do it, Mr. Kahn. We haven't been doing very well together. Well, now that's settled, when are you two boys gonna get to work? - Are you trying to get rid of me? - Don't be silly. Any lyricist in the world would jump at this chance. Well, how do you like that? That's gratitude. I put on a tie for her, I quit my job, even cut my hair. We're partners. Now she wants to pawn me off on a new tune-writer. - All right, let's forget it. - No, wait. Mr. Kahn, we've got to stop fooling ourselves right here and now. My tunes aren't in the same class as your lyrics. Our first hit was an accident. You wouldn't know a good tune. - Don't pass up an opportunity... - Play the song. - Mr. Kahn... - Ms. LeBoy, I'll pick my own partners. Play the song. Yes, Mr. Kahn. Hang around. Tell her how good it is. This is good. Wonderful! Wonderful! That's the best thing you ever did. - Are you sure? - Sure? I'll leave it to the expert. You tell her. Well, frankly, it sounds a little reminiscent. What does he know? A few lucky hits. - Thirty million copies, is all. - I tell you, this is her. This is what she's like inside. Do you think I've caught the real me? Couldn't be anybody else. Give me a pencil. Somebody give me a pencil. Play it again. Oh, wait. Wait till he leaves. He's liable to steal it. Goodbye, Fred. Mr. Kahn, Ms. LeBoy. Good luck with your lyric. You're about to get yourself a song. Memories, memories Dreams of love so true O'er the sea of memory I'm drifting back to you Childhood days, wild wood days Among the birds and bees You left me alone But still you're my own In my beautiful memories I'm very proud to introduce that beautiful song. I know you would like to meet its writers. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the lyricist, Mr. Gus Kahn. And the composer, Mr. Egbert Van Alstyne. Meet the real me. Why make a fool of me in front of those people? - The song's a bit hit, isn't it? - I don't have to be tricked into success. If I can't make it on my own, what's the use of getting there? If that's all the thanks I get, Mr. Kahn... I wasn't looking for a new partner, or another girl. And now I guess I better start looking for both. If I've been your girl, I've never noticed it. Why, you're still calling me Ms. LeBoy. For years, you've been blowing cigar smoke in my face... ...acting like a truck driver and treating me like one. - What's that got to do with it? - It's all over. - I'm through with you and your songs. - Now, you listen here. You're the most ungrateful person I have ever met. Oh, but you're gonna be a big songwriter, Mr. Kahn. Don't let me stand in your way. You're not in my way at all, Grace. - Gus. - What? - You called me Grace. - I did? Well, you called me Gus. - You know what? - What? I guess we'll have to get married. Is that a proposal? What, you have to have it in writing? But you've never kissed me. You never even said you love me. Well, gosh, what do you want? Moon, June, love, dove. That's my business all day. - Mr. Kahn. - Yeah? Let's get down to business. Come on in, Bert. Grace, you home? We've been looking all over for you. - Hello, Bert. - Hello, Grace. Dinner show's in a half-hour. We're gonna miss it. - Tony Jackson has a new piece. - They'll play it tonight. "Jelly Roll Rag." Change the melody, a good lyric, there may be a song in it. - Yeah. - I must tell you something. - So tell me. - Alone. - What? - Bert, do you mind? - Come on. We're gonna be late. - Gus, it's important. - Won't it keep? - Not if you keep pushing me this way. Pushing? Who's pushing? Let's go. Please, let's get out of here. It's so stuffy and smoky. This is the tune Tony wants us to fix up. In the bridge, the middle part, if you can change that... I think I've got it, I think I've got it. Gus, I wanna tell you something. I've told you, when I'm looking at the ceiling, I'm working. You'll have to stop for one minute. This is important. It can't be more important than this. My dear husband, I'm gonna have a baby. - What? - I'm gonna have a baby. - What? - I'm pregnant! - Well, aren't you surprised? - No. Really? Gee, you think it'll look like me? Oh, no. It's gonna be a pretty baby. Bert. I've got it. I've got it! Everybody loves a baby That's why I'm in love with you Pretty baby, pretty baby And I'd like to be your sister Brother, dad and mother too Pretty baby, pretty baby Won't you come and let me rock you In my cradle of love And we'll cuddle all the time Oh, I want a lovin' baby And it might as well be you Pretty baby of mine Pretty baby, pretty baby Won't you come and let me rock you In my cradle of love And we'll cuddle all the time Oh, I want a lovin' baby And it might as well be you Pretty baby of mine Pretty baby of... How much are you paying? - Well, how much do you usually get? - How much do you usually pay? Thirty dollars a month. - I usually get 40. - That's what we pay. Is the work hard? You know, I'm not so young. I've got a touch of the lumbago too. How's your sinus? The work is very easy. We have a small place and we like simple cooking. Then why did your last maid quit? She married Jack the Ripper and couldn't handle both jobs. You know, I don't believe you ever had a maid. - What business are you in? - I'm a chicken-plucker. Gus, please. My husband is a songwriter. Haven't you heard "I Wish I had a Girl," "Memories" and "Pretty Baby"? I heard them. I didn't like them. You didn't like them? Grace, this is ridiculous. Wouldn't have her in the house if she worked for nothing. - Get her out before I lose my temper. - Well, guess I'd better stay. You're a nice woman, but him, somebody's got to watch. - Just a minute... - It's no use. I've made up my mind. Where's the kitchen? - It's over there. - Look... You can think you're the boss, I'll think I'm the boss... ...and you, you just have the baby. Well, I'm glad she's gonna let us do something. Gus, what is the matter with you? You've been growling like a bear lately. I don't know. I don't know, I... I'm going down and see Fred. - It's the song, isn't it? - Yeah. Now, you listen to me. "The One I Love" is the best thing you've ever done. Take this and show it to him again. If he still doesn't like it, I'll take it to another publisher. - But, honey, listen... - Let me do the worrying. - Grace thinks it's the best thing I've done. - She thinks everything's the best. Tell her to trust my judgment. I've done all right by you so far, haven't I? I've told her, Fred. She says she'll take it to another publisher. She'll take it? When do you start voting? Or hasn't Abraham Lincoln freed the husbands yet? Fred, I don't think any more of this than you do. - But I don't know, Grace... - Grace, Grace, Grace. Look, she got you away from Bert Van Alstyne. She found an ex-coalminer, Isham Jones, who writes music by the light of his hat... ...and now she wants to change publishers. She's only doing it for my good, she says. Gus, Grace is a wonderful woman. I love her almost as much as you do. But now that she's gonna become a mother, it's time she was told to stay out of music. You're right, Fred. You're absolutely right. - When are you gonna tell her? - Me? You paid for the license, you tell her. And right now. - Now? - Now. You wanna wait... ...until she becomes a grandmother? Go home and face her like a man. Now, look, Fred... - Here. - Another beer? No, no. Give me about that much courage. How can I make you understand that, in my thinking... ...a man's gotta be a man in his own house? Stop running my life. We're gonna have a family. That ought to be enough for you. Forget about "The One I Love." Forget about the music business. Stop trying to make me such a great success. I'm happy, happy the way I am. It wasn't so long ago I was pushing a crockery wagon. Well, that's just fine. Be sure you tell her all those things when she comes home. - Where is Mrs. Kahn? - Somebody phoned... ...and said a Sam Harris was hearing new songs, auditioning. You weren't here, so she went downtown to see him herself. You let her, in her condition? Why didn't you stop her? Somebody has to pay my salary. - I need some coffee. - And so do I. Make enough for two. What...? Kick a little higher, girls. Now turn. - That's fine. - Thank you, girls. - Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. - You heard him, 10:00. And I want every girl on time. That guy's a slave driver. Work half the night, back at 10 in the morning. It hardly pays to take my clothes off. This ending is very weak. Fill up the last four bars. - Save the house lights. - Save the house lights. - Bring me those sketches. - Jim, let's see the new sketches again. No, this clashes. You see what I mean? - No, this is more what I need... - Excuse me, please. Is Mr. Harris here? Excuse me, please. I would like to see Mr. Harris. You're seeing him. - Get on this. - How do you do? - I'd like to see the second act costumes. - Costumes... - How do you do? My name is Grace Kahn. - Hello. I heard about your audition. I've got a wonderful song. That was over hours ago. I've already selected a song. - No, no, honey... - That isn't fair. I didn't hear about it till a half-hour ago. I was home in bed. Look, the name of my song is "The One I Love." - I know when you hear it... - I told you... ...l've already selected the song. It's getting late. I've got a thousand things to do. I haven't got time to listen to it. I'm a very busy man. Oh, Joe, Joe, Harry... ...will you show the young lady the door? I'm very, very busy. You're busy? I'm plugging a song, keeping house, buying the groceries... ...l'm gonna have a baby. Top that. - Take it easy, boys. We could be sued. All right, I'll listen to your song, Ms. Kahn. Mrs. Kahn, if you please. Oh, yes, yes, Mrs. Kahn. I'm sorry. Fred, will you help her out on the piano? Spotlight. The one I love Belongs to somebody else Mr. Harris. I'm listening. I always listen and walk around. Not with my husband's songs, you don't. You'll sit right down there and listen to every word. Oh, I'm sorry. For a minute, I thought this was my theater. All right, girls, later. Fred, please help the young lady do her song. Harry, Harry, a chair. The one I love Belongs to somebody else He means his tender songs For somebody else And even when I have My arms around him I know his thoughts are strong For somebody else The hands I hold Belong to somebody else I'll bet they're not so cold To somebody else It's tough to be alone on the shelf It's worse to fall in love by yourself The one I love Belongs to somebody else The one I love Belongs To somebody else Lady, you just sold a song. That's perfect for the first-act finale. - Say, that girl has talent. - You don't know how much. For an encore, she may have twins. He's a beautiful baby, Mr. Kahn. They all look like that? Where's Grace? - You like to know how much he weighs? - Why, who's he fighting? - Where's Grace? - Room 708. Thanks. - Gracie. - She's still under the anesthetic. Sweetheart? Hey. Hey. Sweetheart. Hey. The baby's a big hit. So's the song. Couldn't have managed either of them without you. Got something for you. Look. Hey. That's for you. Hey, sleepyhead. Take care of yourself, sweetheart. I love you very much. - Oh, nurse? - You'll have to leave now. Do you want me to tell her anything when she wakes up? Yeah. Tell her I dropped by. And the kid's all right too. You're nobody's sweetheart now They don't baby you somehow Fancy hose, silken gown You'd be out of place In your own hometown When you walk down the avenue I just can't believe that it's you Painted li'I lips Painted li'I eyes Wearing a bird of paradise. It all seems wrong somehow That you're nobody's sweetheart now Nights are long since you went away I think about you all through the day My buddy, my buddy Nobody Quite so true Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye Toot, Toot, Tootsie, don't cry The choo-choo train that Takes me away from you No words can tell how sad it makes me Kiss me, Tootsie, and then I'll do it over again Watch for the mail I'll never fail If you don't get a letter Then you know I'm in jail Toot, Toot, Tootsie, don't cry Toot, Toot, Tootsie, goodbye! The armistice, the armistice! The war's over! Oh, I can't believe it. Oh, I don't believe it's over. Oh, I can't believe it. I can't believe it's over. I'm gonna go and sleep for a month. No, for a whole year, I'm gonna sleep. I'm gonna go somewhere where there's... Everybody loves a baby That's why I'm in love with you - Pretty baby - No. - Pretty baby - Yes. Oh, I want a lovin' baby - And it might as well be you - Isn't that wonderful? - Pretty baby of mine - I wonder which one of us it'll look like. - Any pains yet? - No. What are you doing to me? Six hours, I've been waiting here in agony. Gus, you're making yourself a nervous wreck. Do something else for a few hours. Well, I could have my appendix taken out while I'm waiting. Why don't you go down and have a drink with the boys, huh? Well, what about you? The doctor says the baby isn't due until midnight. Doctor says. What, is it coming in on the Broadway Limited? Will you please do as I say? Honest, I won't have it till you come back. - Promise? - Promise. Boy, you don't know what I've been going through all day. Gus, as soon as you feel any pains, hurry back. Hey, I'm beginning to feel pains. What time is it? My watch is worn out. Why don't you relax? Who's having this baby, you or me? Gus, listen to the melody again. Maybe it'll give you an idea. That's the best tune Isham Jones wrote, don't you think so? - What time is it? - Oh, will you listen? That's a good tune. Yeah, that's a good tune. How do the doctors know? Could be 10 months, 11. Poor Grace. How does she get into these things? Anna, are you sure he hasn't even called? Nope. Are you sure you're married to him? Come to think of it, I never have seen the license. - Anna, I'm worried. - The main thing is you're all right... ...and the baby's all right. I'll go call Fred Townsend again. Well, look who's here. What'd you come up for, take a bow? Honey, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Say hello to Irene. Hello, Irene. I'm your father. Isn't she pretty? Honey, last night, you know, you told me to go out with the boys... ...and I went over to the club and, well, I got with Fred... ...and I was really worried about you. I kept asking every minute what time... ...and then we got on a tune, and... It's all right, Gus. Well, you know how I am. I get interested all of a sudden and... You don't have to explain. I understand. I'm really sorry. I think we got a good song. Wanna look at it? "Why do I do just as you say? Why must I just give you your way?" It's so scribbled, I can't read it. Why do I sigh? Why do I try to forget? It must have been that something lovers call fate. That kept on saying I had to wait. I saw them all. Just couldn't fall 'til we met It had to be you It had to be you I wandered around and finally found Somebody who Could make me be true Could make me be blue And even be glad just to be sad Thinking of you Some others I've seen Might never be mean Might never be cross Or try to be boss But they wouldn't do Nobody else gave me a thrill With all your faults, I love you still It had to be you Wonderful you It had to be you By the way, by the way Take her hand. When we meet the preacher, I'll say Yes, sir, that's my baby No, sir, don't mean maybe Yes, sir, that's my baby now Everybody hand in hand Swinging down the lane Everybody feeling grand Swinging down the lane That's the time I miss the bliss That we might have known Nights like this When I'm all alone Oh, not so hard. You should be very thankful, young lady, getting a bath every night. When I was your age, I got a bath only on Saturday. - Boy, were you lucky. - Donald, what are you sitting there moping? Promotion's tomorrow. You don't know your poem. - Now, come on, take it from the top. - Okay. Ay, tear that tattered ensign down! That long has waved on high You're reading it like it's a label on a bottle of ketchup. Ay, tear her battered ensign down! And long has it waved on high On high And many an eye has danced to see That banner in the sky; Who asked you? I was just helping. Look, I'm big enough to recite my own poem. - I'm big enough to take my own bath. - Shut up. - That's right. You don't have to soap her. - Look, I pay all the bills. Let me make believe I'm a member of this family. Telephone, dear. How do these kids get so dirty? - It's New York calling. Florenz Ziegfeld. - Who? - Florenz Ziegfeld. - Ziegfeld? - Hello? - Hello, Gus. This is... - Hello? - Giddyup, boy. Come on. Hello, Mr. Ziegfeld. Yeah, yeah, this is Gus Kahn. Come on, boy. Giddyup, come on, boy. Yeah. All right. You want me to write a show for you? - Step on it. - Step on it? Donald, be quiet. - Get down. - Giddyup. - Donald, get down. - Giddyup. Just a minute, please. Donald, Donald, I mean it. Get down. Please stop pestering your father. He's talking business. Hello, I'm sorry. Wanna come to New York and do this show? Well, yes, I'm very flattered, Mr. Ziegfeld, but why do I have to go to New York? - I want Daddy to button me. - Come here, I'll button you. No, I was talking to my little girl. Look, I have a nice new house here and my wife likes me around. My kids are very happy. We're eating three square meals a day. Are things any better in New York? - This is the way I've always worked. - Mr. Ziegfeld, this is Grace Kahn. - May I ask who's starring in the show? - Eddie Cantor. - Oh, really? Who's the composer? - Walter Donaldson. Gus, it's Walter Donaldson. I wouldn't care if it was Beethoven unless he's in Chicago. - Hang up. - You're impossible. - Mr. Ziegfeld. - Who's Ludwig van Beethoven? - A piano player who looked like this: - I think it's a wonderful idea. Yes, I do. Gus, will you please be quiet? This is too good a chance for Gus to miss. - Will he do it? - Yes. - What are you doing? - He'll be in New York. - Grace, give me that. - Fine, we'll consider it closed. - Honey, I hurt you? - Mommy. - No, it's all right. - Anna. Anna. Quick. - What is it? What happened? - Daddy hit Mama. - It was an accident. - Right in the eye. - Dear? - Oh, go away. I was trying to help him, but he insists on being a problem. And he struck you? Ziegfeld offered him a show and he turned it down. - Please. - He turned it down? Please, let me make one decision. All right, make it. Stay in Chicago and be a big frog in a little puddle. A man with your talent. You should be ashamed. - Grace. - It would be so good for you to go away. A whole new life. Different people, different environment. - And different women? - You're not the type. Not the type. Someday, I'm gonna meet a girl who'll let me win an argument just once. And you watch out. I pity the poor girl. Come on, children, I'll put you to bed. Now, just a minute. I put them to bed every night. Get into the kitchen, check your cookbook. - Your potato pancakes tonight were terrible. - I suppose all your songs are hits. - lf he starts anything, holler. - We will. Anna, let's start packing Mr. Kahn's things. Thanks for everything, dear God. And please forgive Daddy for hitting Mommy. - Right in the eye. - It was an accident. You get this through your heads. I wouldn't hit your mother, no matter what happened. - I happen to love Mama very much. - You never tell her you love her. You two. Come on. I'll tuck you in bed. I can get in myself, thank you. - Donald? - Good night. Good night. Good night. Honest to goodness, kids. There's nobody in the world that means more to me than your mother. - It's all right, Daddy. - We understand. - It was an accident when you hit her. - Right in the eye. Is this Walter Donaldson's apartment? - Go home. The party's over. - Oh, I'm Gus Kahn. You're kidding. Come in. Ought to be a better way of starting the day than waking up. Should have seen this place before the maid tidied it up. - Sit down. Had breakfast? - Had lunch. Oh, one of those. Pardon me while I fix myself something. My grandfather had a bottle of beer for breakfast every day of his life. Lived to the ripe old age of 28. Very funny. Hope we don't start work every day at 1:00 in the afternoon... ...with a stale glass of beer and a joke to match. If you're the eager-beaver type, I got a tune you can start working on right now. - Mind if I get dressed? - lf you can handle it. Well, this is gonna be a beautiful collaboration, isn't it? You don't like me. - Hello. - Hello. - You here from last night? - No, from this afternoon. Well, party's starting early today, isn't it? - Walter. - Wait, you can't go in there. He's dressing. - Are you from out of town or something? - That you, Frankie? Yeah, honey. I'll wait out here with your scoutmaster. That's Gus Kahn from Chicago. He's the bard of the Corn Belt. Introduce yourself. Frankie Mason. Kiss it or shake it. I don't know what goes in Chicago. I haven't got much time. Got an important appointment. - Can I say something? - No. - I thought we were gonna work. - She'll hum you the tune on the way. - Come on. She knows it by heart. - I gotta... Just shut your eyes, honey, and let it happen. You and your jockey friends. Maybe it was the other jockey. They're all the same size. - Here, this ought to help you get even. - I'm not hungry. On the back, on the back. - Sam? - Yeah? - Put this on Our Fancy. - On the nose? - Where else? - Okay. It's sort of a going-away present. I'm leaving. Bye, Frankie. You better practice those two notes. Hey, Gus. Wait a minute. Gus, this is it. I can't let you go now. I've been looking for a partner who could work at the track. Well, get yourself a horse with a pencil. No, no. You're not gonna let a little thing... ...like the fact that we hate each other stand in our way? This is a business arrangement. How about it? Look, in Chicago, composers have a very quaint custom of working indoors at a piano. Well, it sounds radical, but for you, I'll give it a go. Deal? You're crazy. Nothing could be finer Than to be in Carolina in the morning No one could be sweeter Than my sweetie when I meet her In the morning Where the morning glories Twine around the door Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more Strolling with my girlie Where the dew is pearly early In the morning Butterflies all flutter up And kiss each little buttercup at dawning If I had Aladdin's lamp For only a day I'd make a wish And here's what I'd say Nothing could be finer Than to be in Carolina In the morning Let's go, kids. On your feet. What kind of a cockamamie lyric is "mo-ho-ho-rning"? Well, it fits the "no-ho-ho-hotes," doesn't it? - I'm not doing this song. - The queen has spoken. Now, now, let's not lose our tempers. My kind of audience isn't paying 6.60 to see a butterfly kiss a buttercup. Only Jolson can get by with a number like that. When I go down on one knee, I lose half my charm. - Can I say something? - No. Butterflies, buttercup. Honestly, Ziggie, are you going in for minstrel shows, after all these years? Gloria's right. This doesn't sound like her type of material. No wonder. She sang it with her clothes on. Well, I have a dinner engagement. - I do hope you boys don't mind if I leave. - It'd be a pleasure. Welcome to Broadway, Gus. Cockamamie, indeed. Come on, Gus. We'll talk it over down at the... Please, please. All I want is a one-way ticket to Chicago. Relax. You and Walter can come up with something much more sophisticated. I'm sorry, Mr. Ziegfeld, but New York is just too big a town for me. Never get another lyric-writer like him. Wrote the first chorus in 135 and three-fifths on a slow track. - Now can I say something? - Yeah. - I liked it. - She liked it. We're in. From the top, kids. One, two. One, two, three, four. I've been waiting for you. - What do you want, your knife back? - Don't run away, Gus. I wanted to let you in on the facts of life. I may scream. I happen to be the leading lady in the new Ziegfeld show. So my material has got to be great. That's why I fight so hard. Yeah, get yourself a new sparring partner. I'm on my way home. I want you. I think you're about the best lyricist there is. In the butterfly-and-buttercup set, you mean. Exactly. But you're on Broadway now. There isn't a morning glory for 15 miles. You have to write something sophisticated. And you can do it, once someone teaches you the meaning of the word. - You applying for the job? - lf it's open. It's funny, you know. Someone once told me I wasn't the type. - I'd be too much trouble for you. - No, you have a talent that can help me. Nothing would be too much trouble. - Coming with me? - Thought you had a dinner date. I thought you were going to Chicago. - Hello? - Long-distance call. This is Mrs. Kahn. Who's calling? Oh, New York. What is it? Who's ringing the phone at 3:00 in the morning? It's Gus calling from New York. I hope everything's all right. Hello? - Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Is Mr. Kahn there? - Who? - Gus Kahn. - Oh, just a moment. Gus. Gus, baby. Your call to Chicago. Go on, go to bed. Could you hold it down a little bit? Could you be a little quiet? - Hello, Gus? - Grace. - What's the matter? - I had to call you. I pinned the Irishman down long enough to finish most of the score. - Did you call me for that? - I thought you'd like to hear it. - It's 3:00 in the morning. - It's 3:00 in Chicago. Well, tell her it's 4:00 here. A wonderful invention, the telephone. Well, it's worth staying awake for. - Gloria's gonna sing. - Who? - Gloria Knight. - Who's Gloria Knight? - Didn't I write to you about her? - You haven't written to me. Well, when I was gonna write, I was gonna tell you about her. Listen. Mrs. Kahn? I just want you to know you have a wonderful husband. And he's written a beautiful song for me. Play, Walter. - She's gonna love this. - Yeah. Love me or leave me And let me be lonely You won't believe me And I love you only I'd rather be lonely than happy With somebody else - You might find the nighttime - "Love me or leave me"? The right time for kissing But nighttime is my time For just reminiscing Regretting instead of forgetting With somebody else There'll be no one Unless that someone is you I intend to be independently blue I want your love But I don't want to borrow To have it today And give back tomorrow For my love is your love There's no love for nobody else You ever think your husband could write something like that? No, I didn't, baby. It's a whole new life here in New York. You were right. It's just what I needed. - How are the kids? - "How are the kids"? Donald recited "Old Ironsides" at school and the teacher said... Hello? Gu...? Love me or leave me And let me be lonely You won't believe me And I love you only I'd rather be lonely than happy With somebody else You might find the nighttime The right time for kissing But nighttime is my time For just reminiscing - Thanks, honey. - Regretting instead of forgetting - With somebody else - Grace. I come 800 miles and that's all I get? - Hey, Gus, who's the new blond? - Does Gloria know about this? This is my wife. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Bigmouth. - Well, I didn't say anything. Honey, you know how those chorus girls are. How are they, Gus? I want your love But I don't want to borrow To have it today And give back tomorrow For my love is your love There's no love for nobody else That's Gloria Knight, the girl who sang to you over the phone. I had to be nice to her... ...because you don't know how hard it was for us to get her to do our numbers. And she's a very big singer. She could be a big help to me. Us. Oh, I understand. You do? That why you came all the way from Chicago? - Don't be silly. - I don't think it's being silly. After all, I don't blame you for worrying. Here I am in New York, all alone, and different people... Gus, please. I wasn't worried at all. I just came to see the show, that's all. What am I, Jojo the Dog Face Boy or Peter the Hermit? Don't you think it's possible a pretty girl could make a pass at me? It's possible. But she wouldn't have gotten anyplace. Not with my Gus. - Gus, darling, the hook. - Again? This thing comes open at the strangest times. - Remember that night in Pittsburgh? - Oh, don't remind me. I thought I had it all fastened. What a second-act curtain. Oh, by the way, Gloria, this is my wife. How do you do, Ms. Knight? Well, Mrs. Kahn. I'm so sorry. We've spoken over the telephone, haven't we? No. No, I just sort of listened. I better put on my winter underwear. - Gus, you're wanted out front. Ziggie. - Thanks. That means Ziegfeld. You'd be surprised how much I've learned. You wait right here, young lady. I gotta talk to you. - Mrs. Kahn. - Yes? Will you come in for a second? Won't you take off your boxing gloves and sit down? Thank you. You know, this is a new experience for me. I've never talked to another man's wife without a lawyer in the room. - What is there to talk about? - Don Juan out there, with the cigars. He's putting on a big act for your benefit. And I'm not going to let him get away with it. - Is it an act? - I never hide my conquests, darling. Only my defeats. And believe me, this time, I was shut out. At first, it was strictly business. All of a sudden, I found myself falling for that sad-eyed... ...old hound of a husband of yours. So I tried to get into the Kennel Club. Would you mind telling me what happened? Nothing. Absolutely, positively and humiliatingly nothing. It was almost enough to make a girl wonder if she was... - Cigarette? - No, thank you. Do you know how many times he showed me pictures of you... ...little Donald and little Irene? Ay, tear her tattered ensign down! After a while, I got to hate those kids. They were a symbol of something that I'd never achieve. And how he talked about the way you play the piano. You must play a wonderful piano, Mrs. Kahn. Thank you for being so honest, Ms. Knight. But if I ever catch you with him again, I'm gonna scratch your eyes out. Bye. - What was that for? - That's for nothing. Absolutely, positively and humiliatingly nothing. Another bride, another June Another sunny honeymoon Another season, another reason For makin' Whoopee A lot of shoes, a lot of rice The groom is nervous He answers twice It's really killing that he's so willing Whoopee Picture a little love nest Down where the roses cling And picture the same sweet love nest What a year can bring He's washing dishes and baby clothes He's so ambitious, he even sews So don't forget, folks That's what you get, folks - For makin' whoopee - For makin' whoopee Another year, or maybe less - What's this I hear? - Well, can't you guess? She feels neglected And he's suspected of makin' whoopee Shot with my own words. She sits alone most every night He doesn't phone He doesn't write I was busy. He says he's busy But she says, "Is he?" He's makin' whoopee - I have to work, don't I? - That's work? He doesn't make much money Only 5000 per Some judge who thinks he's funny Says, "You pay 6 to her" And then I say, "Judge, suppose I fail?" The judge says, "Budge right into jail" - You better keep her - I think it's cheaper - Than makin' whoopee - Than makin' whoopee - Come in. - Aren't you folks gonna have supper? - We're makin' whoopee - We're makin' whoopee No, no, Nora Nobody but you, dear You know, Nora Yours truly is true, dear And would I trade you for Venus? No, no, Nora, no, no! I saw your eyes Your wonderful eyes My heart has taught me their meaning If you like Ukulele Lady Ukulele Lady like a'you If you like to linger where it's shady Ukulele Lady linger too If you kiss Ukulele Lady While you promise ever to be true Gus, been looking all over for you. - Wonderful party. - Thanks, Fred. I can't stay. My train leaves in half an hour. I hate to see you go, but good luck in Hollywood. Everybody's moving out there since pictures began to talk. - Why don't you get in on the act? - I can't get this house on a train. - Even Donaldson's coming West. - Yeah? I gave him an advance on your new number. Our new number? Yeah, you know, the Italian-type song. You said you were nuts about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Italian-type song. Yeah. - Bye. - So long. Take care. If you like Ukulele Lady Ukulele Lady like a'you I still don't like it. Oh, Walter. Surprised to see so much liquor in your house. How come? - Expecting to be bit by a snake? - I have been. Come here. What's the Italian-type number? - Oh, the Italian number. - Yeah. You weren't to know until I got to Hollywood. You took an advance from Fred on a number I never agreed to. If you needed money, all you had to do was ask me. Well, I didn't wanna be beholden to you, chief. You're getting to be such a big man now. How do you know I'll like this tune? My tunes were good enough for you once. Just put the words to it. I never write up anything I don't believe in. Is that statement for me or for posterity? You could at least have let me hear the tune and decide if I like it. Decide, Gus? Who decides, you or Grace? Since you've been with Isham Jones and Dick Whiting... ...did she tell you to get rid of little Walter? I've taken an awful lot from you. I've had to follow you around... ...waiting for you to get in the mood to sit down at a piano. Many a time, I had to prop you up when I got you there. Now, I'm not asking for gratitude, but keep my wife out of this. As a matter of fact, it's a very good idea if we quit working together. Well, thank you and good afternoon, Mr. Grace Kahn. Why don't you take a walk and sober up? Yeah, why don't you get a drink and get her to give you back your pants? Well, I see by the tracks Papa Bear has come home. Is she still here? Why do you think I stayed out half the night? - Why didn't you tell her? - You don't get rid of me so easy. I explained to her we couldn't afford a maid. Do you think anybody who could afford a maid would hire me... ...an old party with lumbago? Anna, you know how things have been. I haven't even paid you for three months. This isn't the kind of job you take for money. It's like being in the Army. You'll owe me. All right, if you're gonna stay, you're gonna stay. Where's my supper? If you came home at a decent hour, you'd have it with the family. - I don't cook three times a night. - What? It's on the kitchen table, waiting. Gus. Gus, why don't you call Fred Townsend? What for? Maybe he could get you something in Hollywood. Honey, I don't go begging for favors. If Fred wants me, he knows where he can find me. Well, I thought it over. I'll do it. Ten dollars apiece. I thought it over too. Three for 25. - All right, in advance. - Okay. Here's for six. Hey, you think you could write a song for that tall dame? I guess so. Okay. Now, get out of here, genius. People think I write this stuff myself. Gus, I've been so worried about you. - Did I awaken you? - Where have you been? I was downtown. I ran into a few guys who really appreciate my work. - What are you doing? - Writing lyrics. Nothing could be finer than to give The guy a shiner in the first round - What kind of a lyric is that? - It's a parody. But you're making fun of your own songs. Well, who has a better right? And $ 10 a funny. Oh, I got one I want you to hear. This one I think is really cute. Come here. Listen to this. Two fellas go out on a blind date, see. And this one guy gets a girl named Betty. Sit down, sit down. I planned the name Betty because it's got a silly rhyme. Anyhow, the minute he takes a look at this girl, this is what he says: It had to be me That had to get you I stand 5-foot- 10 A man among men But you're 7'2" I meet lots of girls When I make the rounds But none are like you Seven-foot-two, 70 pounds But you make me thrill And you always will I realize, Betty You look like spaghetti But what can I do? It's your fingertips That I adore When you stand up They touch the floor It had to be you, wonderful you Seven-foot-two Don't you think that's funny? You better get some sleep. - Number, please. - Long distance, please. - Hello. Yes, ma'am. - Hello? Hello, I'd like to place a person-to-person call... ...to Fred Townsend in Hollywood, California. Hello? Who? Oh, just a minute. When the concert's over, there's a phone call for you, long distance. Long distance. I wonder who that could be. - Where's it from? - Hollywood. Maybe Rin Tin Tin needs a new theme song. - Hollywood? Hello? - Hello, Gus, Fred Townsend. - Hello, Fred. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you too. - Honey, it's Fred. - Merry Christmas, Fred. - Grace is fine? - Yes, she's fine. - How about the kids? - We're all fine. Good. I wonder if you'd be interested in doing a picture. Well, I don't know, Fred. I'm kept pretty busy here. They want me in Hollywood. Fred's got a picture for me. Oh, Gus. Yeah. Yeah, well, as a favor to you, Fred, I'd do it, sure, but... - The money's very good. - All right. All right. You got a deal. - See you in a week. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - That's wonderful. - Where are my cigars? - Get him a cigar. - Think the whole family could go out? - I wouldn't go without you. Did he say anything about transportation? - No. - Well, who's gonna pay for the tickets? - You should have asked him that. - Oh, honey, I couldn't do that. We have to put up a front. We'll hit somebody for a loan. Who? Everybody in Chicago's broke. How about Bert? Bert Van Alstyne. - He's in New York. - Here. - What's that? - It's from not playing the stock market. - Annie. - Oh, no. Go on, take it. Who else would loan money to a songwriter? And get me a lower berth. - Anna... - Hey, are we going somewhere? Where are we going? You missed it. Daddy was talking to Uncle Fred all the way in Hollywood. Daddy has a job out there. You're so smart. I heard Mama talking to him last night. Didn't I? Well, didn't I? Yes, Donald. - Can we swim in the ocean, Mommy? - Yes, darling. Gus, we have no secrets from Fred. I simply told him the truth, that's all. You needed this. Do I have to be wet-nursed through my whole life? No, Gus. I just have a little less pride than you have. Yeah, sure, sure. You have a little less pride. A little more push too. When I was on top, I never knew if I was writing the hits or you were making them. For years, everybody's been saying the same thing. What do you want me to do? Stand on the sidelines and watch your talent dry up? I'm your wife, Gus. I've got a right to help you. Would it make you any happier if I collected an agent's commission? There's such a thing as too much help. I didn't know I was in the way. I've gotten to depend upon you so much, I can't think for myself anymore. Look what's happened to us. Is the depression my fault too? You pick my ties, my suits, my tune-writers. You even order for me in a restaurant. Well, from now on, just order for one. Gus. I'm leaving. Take the kids out for a walk or something. Aren't you going to say goodbye to them? You'll think of something to tell them. Yeah. That's one thing I'm good at. - Stop it. Stop it. - What's the matter? Isn't that Johann Strauss? I don't see how it can be. I got paid for it last Thursday. Johnny, why don't you try something of your own? This is no time to be revolutionary. We've gotta have a complete score in 10 days. So we take a little of Strauss. And we steal a little of this: And we throw in a little of this: And then some... and we got it. Listen. You're a great tune-writer, how can you do a thing like this? - I'll tell you in one word. Money. - Yeah. Look, Gus, you've been fighting this for months, and what has it got you? You've been thrown out of two studios already. Believe me, you can't win. There are only two kinds of people in this town: The ones who eat at Romanoff's and the ones who serve them. Stop rehearsing for a tray and let's give them what they want. Okay, okay, I give up. Go ahead, play it. I can't put my finger on it, but it just doesn't ring a bell. I've got one outside on my bicycle. Should I bring it in? I know you've been working 14 hours a day on this. The bad stuff always comes twice as hard. Well, that's that. Gus, did I ever tell you how I first met you? Met me? Back in college, there was a beat-up phonograph in our fraternity house. Nine out of 10 records we played were Gus Kahn songs. That's how I first met you. When all the smart boys in Hollywood said you were through... ...I remembered that phonograph player. Stop. I'm getting all choked up. Thanks for the kind words, but it's no use. I don't write what they're singing today. Is it that you don't write it or you can't write it? Maybe the smart boys are right. Listen here, son. Don't you sit there and tell me I'm through. This is Gus Kahn you're talking to. I was writing hits when you were in kindergarten. And I'm gonna go on writing them, but my way, not yours. Look, don't fly off the handle, Gus. Times change, formulas change. A man with your talent shouldn't let the parade pass him by. I don't want any part of this parade. It was my own fault for trying to copy it. I don't copy anybody. They copy me. I don't write by formula. To me, a song isn't just words set to music. It's something from the heart that's real and honest and says something. - Not silly sounds... and: - Oh, now, Gus... I'm through. Go get yourself a parrot. What got into him? Better find a parrot who plays the piano. Gus! - Hello. - Grace. Hello. - You look pretty good. - I'll get him in the next round. - Would you mind if I kissed you? - Come here. Well, what do you think of me? I finally did something all by myself. No help from anybody. - I knew I had a talent. - Stop. Stop it. I had to come 2000 miles to find out I'm washed up. You know, when they brought me to this hospital... ...it was the first time in two years I had my name in Variety. I couldn't even get in the Brown Derby. When I was younger, I didn't mind if people pushed me around. I had to struggle, because I never knew what success was really like. But once you've lived on the top of the world... ...it's no fun anymore at the bottom. Gus, I'm ashamed of you. I'm ashamed because you're forgetting who you are... ...and what you've done and what you're going to do. Who pulled the blinds down? This is the town where they'd ask Shakespeare, "What have you done lately?" But you write one hit and you're back up on top. - I don't write their kind of songs. I can't. - Well, I should hope not. First thing I have to do is get you out and put you to work. I can't let you lie here feeling sorry for yourself. - You know something? - What? When you first walked in, I thought I was sick. - You'll have to leave. It's his bath now. - All right. - Isn't she pretty? - Of course. This is Hollywood, isn't it? - Oh, honey. - What? You remember the backstage that time at Whoopee? You mean Gloria Knight? Big phony. Nothing happened. I've been meaning to tell you that for a long time. Oh, you took a load off my mind. Thank you. Isn't she pretty? Well? - How'd he take it? - Fine. He's gonna be all right, Fred. And he's gonna keep on writing songs. But, Mrs. Kahn, I've warned you. If he works... What do you think will happen to him if he doesn't work, doctor? You know, there are some things in a man's heart that don't show up on a cardiogram. Fred, is it all right for a girl my age to cry? Sure. - How's the new team coming along? - Great. He's teaching me quite a bit. Wouldn't it sound better this way? Sorry. If that tune doesn't strike you, how about this one? Crackerjack Song Service. If you don't hear what you want, just ask for it. - Walter. - Hello, Grace. I'm so glad to see you. I thought you didn't approve of me. Then why would I send for you? Come on in. - You're sure it's all right? - Of course. What's the trouble, money? No. Money won't help Gus. - He needs something only you can give. - What? Another hit, Walter. That's the best medicine in the world. Grace, how do you guarantee a hit? I might come up with nothing. I've done it before. But that isn't important. Gus has to feel that he's back with the boys on top. He'll take it from there. We stopped running as an entry a long time ago. It'll be much easier for him with somebody else. Here he comes. - Well, if it isn't the smiling Irishman. - Hello, Gus. I must be in pretty bad shape to drag you away from the track. As a matter of fact, I was losing... ...and I thought it was about time I dropped in and said hello. - How are you, Gus? - Fine. Fine, I'm working. Matter of fact, I'm working on a few tunes right now. I found an up-and-coming young fellow with a lot of fresh new ideas. We expect to have a few tunes out any day now and... Why am I telling you the story of my life? Visiting hours are over. Gus, you kind of put me in a tough spot, because I came to ask a favor. I haven't got it anymore, Walter. You caught me between millions. No, it isn't money. It's something that only you can give me. - What? - Another hit. And I sure need one. You won't have to chase me around anymore. I'm a new kind of guy. I got a wonderful wife and a new home and I'd like to be able to afford them. So... ...if I bring you a note from my mother, could we work together again, chief? What do you think, Grace? Oh, it's up to you, Gus. I'm not running your life anymore. - I finally got her trained. - Yeah. It's a deal. I don't know how word got around so fast, but I just got a call from Jerry Kern. He wants to know how soon Gus can go to work. Same from Harry Akst, same from Harry Warren... ...and Isham Jones just airmailed a melody from Chicago. - Well, that's wonderful. - You're a wonderful woman, Grace. I should have married you the day you walked into my office. I'd probably be president now. No, on second thought, you'd probably be president. Isn't it awful? It's the simple tunes that drive you crazy. I'm stuck right in the middle. Play it for me. Why have you got it so dark in here? - Where'd you get that dress? - It's an old one. - I don't like it. - You always did like it. Play it. Play it, will you? Grace, please, play the melody. I'm digging for a line and you're giving me arrangements. - I'm sorry. - Whoever told you you could play piano? - You did. - I was young then. I'll try to do better. - Where's my pencil? - Behind your ear. All right, play, play. Still I feel the thrill of your charms... - Pretty. - What? Your dress. - How's my piano-playing? - Next week, Carnegie Hall. - What are the words, Gus? - Take a look at them. If you come out even, we've got a song. "I'll See You in My Dreams." Play it for me. I'll see you in my dreams Hold you in my dreams Someone took you out of my arms Still I feel The thrill of your charms Lips that once were mine Tender eyes that shine They will light My way tonight I'll see you in My dreams In the main ballroom, we can seat 300 guests. - The table for the guest of honor... - Fine. I don't want any fruit salad or chicken la king. These people are in the music business. With them, eating's a ritual. I don't know why you're making these arrangements. How am I going to get Gus to show up? I don't know, I don't know. Say anything. Tell him the dinner's for Jerome Kern. What'll I do when Gus finds out the surprise dinner is for him, that I tricked him? Come on, Grace. He must've gotten to like it by now. Leave the bottle. I'm throwing caution to the wind. To the party. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Good evening. - I never can get this tie straight. - Turn around. I'll fix it for you. I could've gone to the ball game. Instead, you dress me up like a headwaiter. - Will you stand still? - Grace. - Hello, Walter. - Who's your little boy? The same one I've been taking care of for years. You're here on Jerome Kern night? You never attend a testimonial for anyone but yourself. Well, it got to be a long time between dinners. - Gus. - Hi, John. Don't believe what anyone tells you. You look lovely. It took the family to get him into that suit. Why make a big thing about a dinner? You'd think the guy needed the meal. Everybody's here. George Gershwin, Sigmund Romberg, Vincent Youmans... Yeah, come on. Let's go, Grace. They're waiting for the second team. Don't look at me, it was Walter's idea. I couldn't let you know it was for you, darling. You'd still be running. It's customary for the guest of honor to make a speech after dinner... ...but this kid is liable to skip before the soup course. Five years ago, the doctors were counting him out... ...but he got up and walked away before they got to 10. May I present the man that we're paying $ 15 a plate to honor, drinks extra... ...my friend, Gus Kahn. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've had so much in my life for which to be grateful. And one of the most... Well, let me put it this way. You all know I was practically raised on apple strudel. But I have two extra-favorite Irish dishes. Mulligan stew and Walter Donaldson. Which brings up the question, what am I doing up here by myself? It's a room filled with men I've had the privilege to work with... ...and this dinner is really for all of you. But most of all, it's for Grace. I don't know quite how to say it, but without her, I... You're not just gonna sit there and watch me hang, are you? Without this little girl, I'm just a mug. I tried it once. Fell flat on my back. She taught me something many years ago that I'll never forget. She said, "Young folks don't know how to say 'I love you'... ...so you say it for them, put it to 32 bars of music." I guess I've written about a thousand of those "I love you" songs... ...but never said it to my own girl. - Except once, when she was under ether. - Oh, Gus. What's there to be ashamed of? These are our friends. Darling, if I never told it to you, it wasn't that I didn't mean it. It's just that I could never believe that a face like this could say to a face like that... ..."I love you" and get away with it. But I loved you the first day I saw you. I love you now. And God willing, I'll love you as long as I live. - Gus, how about singing a song, huh? - Sing us the first one you ever wrote, huh? You wouldn't believe it, but I really don't even remember it. Honestly, I wrote the song, but I'm sure I don't remember all the words. Will this help, Mr. Kahn? Would you play it for me, Ms. LeBoy? Gee, I wish that I had a girl Like the other fellows had Someone to make a fuss over me To cheer me up when I feel sad On Wednesday night, I'm all alone When I ought to be up At some sweetheart's home And I'm lonesome, awful lonesome Gee I wish I had A girl
