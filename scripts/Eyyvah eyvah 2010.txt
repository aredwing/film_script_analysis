Your grandmother reminds me of my own grandmother, you know? When l got mad at my parents as a kid, l always turned to my grandmother. She was my best friend. With my child's mind, l'd grab my bag... ...and say, ''Come on, gran. Let's us o go. They can stay.'' When l got mad with mine as a kid l'd go to sleep right away. So l could dream about my father. l never saw him, never knew him, never knewwhat he was like either. l imagined he was.. this huge man, like a giant. He'd pick me up with o fingers, put me on his shoulders... ...and we'd wander round the school playground together. But it's like we were flying. All the way to the Ida Mountains. Your father's dead, isn't he? Yes. Then one day l met this. And the dreams finished. l blow all my cares and worries into the thing and there gone. You know, playing it is kind of like yelling. Put it this way, l've become another pied piper. Don't say that. Playing the clarinet is hard, right? Eveything beautiful is hard, Mjgan. You have to work at it. It's a really stubborn instrument. It chooses its players. Some people play for o months and can't make a sound. Some people pick it up once and it happens first time. Have a ty. Let's see if it chooses you. l don't know. Look, it's simple. Go like this with your lips. Like this? Yes. - l can't do it. You play. - What are you going to pay me? Your first tune can be on the house. You've torn my heart out at this hour of night. You asked for it. Hseyin, don't you have a girl? l do but.. - Hseyin, give me some money. - Hey, what's this all about? l'd ask your gran, but she'd never give me any. She's always thinking of you. l need money, son. l have to deliver the cart. - l can't pay for the axle or varnish. - l don't have any either, granddad. No, reall What the hell is this? You've saved a fortune here, gran! What the hell is this? Ayse Badem. Ali Rza Seker. My dad wrote to my mum? Son, your mum got all proud about it. The man doesn't know about you anay. He was engaged when he met your mum. He conned my girl! We were disgraced! We had to keep moving around so he wouldn't find us. Your mum hid all that from you. We were going to tell you one day. We were so worried you'd leave, son. Be worried! You're right! l'll leave! How can you hide something like that? What about eveything l've been through? All those stories.. Stories about ships sinking... ...about him having no grave, and them having a religious marriage. lf only you'd told me earlier. It's worse this way! Speak to me! lt was for your own good, son. Shut up or you'll make my blood boil! And you're still on about my own good. l'm going to find that man! Howwill you find him? All you have is his name and a photo. The letters were written in Istanbul. And the address is on the back. l'll go and find him. But he must be dead by now. Oh, Mjgan! l guess that has to wait. - Can you come here? - Yes, Abla? - l'm in number six. - OK, Abla. That's here. - But there's a man here! - Are you talking about me? l told them 100 times to put me next to a woman. OK, Abla. Come here, Abi.

That seat is mine. - Which one? -13 and 14. l reserved them both. Good for you. What do you want with o seats? What's that got to do with you? lt's OK, Abi. Let's go to the back. We'll find you a seat. Come on. Why don't l just get out if l'm making so much trouble?. What is this, dragging me round all over the place?! OK, Abi. Move on towards the back. Abi! Come down here!

You make her meat for hours. The crab was crap too. All because of you. Your rush things. You don't get crabs like that! Abla, l'm saying it for your own good! What's with a crab like a foot soldier? Crabs buy their asses in the sand. Move above them... ...and they go like this. They zoom away bacards and buy themselves. It's all wrong. Because of you. You rush things. She's a bull, huh? A bull that turns to the side and opens its mouth?! You're shooting a goddamn porn movie with your bull! Listen, bum fluff. l'm out of patience, OK? Get back to your place and don't make me cray here! That's it! Fabulous! Enough lions and tigers. It'll never end. Enough! Look, the woman's soaked in meat! - Enough! She'll get mine flu! - OK, OK.

Er, excuse me. My name's Hseyin. And this is my friend, Firuzan Hanm. We were looking for someone called Ali Rza Seker. - ls that you? - Yes. Yes. Sory, we've disturbed you. ls that you in the photo by any chance? This is so old! Where did you find it? Are you Fethi's son? Fethi the drummer? No. Was it you who wrote these letters? Theywere left by my mother. Are you Ayse's son? Yes. You said ''left''. Did something happen to Ayse? She hasn't died, has she? l'm afraid so. l'm sory to hear that, son. There, that's life. So you're Ayse's son, huh? l'm your son as well. What? l'm your son too. You're my son? Yes. When mum gave up hope ofyou she was pregnantwith me. She hid it from you. My grandparents knew too but they hid it as well. l found them rummaging in the cupboard. Then l came all the way here. Mum never married. They always told me as a child that my dad died before l was born. Are you OK? He's having a turn. Give him some water! Are you OK? l'm fine, son.. l'm fine. Did you never wonder about mum? Are you cra When l met you mother l had a fiance in Istanbul. We were in Lapseki to play music. One night.. l saw your mother from the stage. l was captivated on the spot. My engagement went out of the window. l'd fallen in love. The owner of the music hall where we were working, a woman... ...she sent your mother a message saying l had a fiance in Istanbul. She didn't even give me the chance to explain. l expect there'd been gossip too. She never forgave me. She was right. l wrote these letters. l had other people intervene. But it was useless. l ended my engagement too but she wouldn't listen to me. After a while the letters started coming back. And l lost all trace of her. Three or four years later... ...a musician friend told me he'd seen her in Ezine. l went and saw my beloved in the market place. She was carying a small child. l imagined she was married. The kid was fat of course. That was me. l've never married either. So who was the woman outside? Oh, her??kran HanIm. My neighbour. My foul-weather friend. Hseyin, you have your mother's face. And my build. l have music too. l play the clarinet. Wondemul. Can l call you dad? Of course you can, son. Of course! Oh god! Oh god! Dad.. If it wasn't for Firuzan Hanm, l'd never have found you, you know. No, come on. All this is fated, son. It's in our destiny. l've never had any family myself until now. l thank the Lord. How did we lose Ayse? ln an accident. A car accident? No. The mule trampled her. The animal got a thorn in its hoof. She was tying to get it out. The animal suddenly laid into her. l saw mum flying through the air. God forbid. lt's Ramiz Abi. l know it's rude but l'll be right back. Well, life is full of surprises, huh? We should always be thanMul. lt's as if the sun has come out on a bleak winter's day. Let me check on Hseyin. We'll be back in a minute. OK. What's up? The guys have tracked us down. Theve got Ramiz Abi. They say ifwe don't go thell kill him. But ifwe go, thell kill us all! l said l'd go on my own but they said theywanted you too. You know the Golden Horn Bridge? We have to be under it in an hour. They said ifwe told the police, thed cut Ramiz Abi's throat. What are we going to do? Wait, l'm thinking. Let's call Metin. You think Metin's going to save us? You have a better idea? Maybe he'll bring along some guys on the quiet. How do l know?! You're right. Don't let's go like sheep to the slaughter at least. Just a second, Abla. Where are you, Metin? You onlyjust got here, son. Where are you going? lt's important, dad. A friend's in trouble. He needs me. ls the phone yours? Look, l've recorded my number here. OK? Call me if anything happens. You're being discharged tomorrow, huh? - Yes. - l'll be here for sure. - OK. - Well, take good care. Why isn't he anmering, damn it? lt keeps going to the anmer phone. Leave a message, Abla. We have 20 minutes. Ramiz Abi, this stuff is quicklime. lt'll even eat our bones. Like a mass grave! Hseyin, there going to kill us! Hseyin! OK, guys. That'll do. Step aside. Abi, l mear to god we won't tell anyone! Why do you need to kill us, Abi? Ah, Hseyin! Ah! Ah! Please don't kill us! Please! Was it me who told you to go the real estate agent? Huh?
