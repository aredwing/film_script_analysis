If you're deliberately trying to sabotage the trip, you're doing a pretty good job. No, I just-- I-- I have to go to the bathroom. Is she all right? Uh, just a little carsick. It's just a car. It's just a car. It's just a stupid car! Jesus, Penny. Get a grip. Do you want to be a pathetic freak for the rest of your miserable life? Penny? Penny? Penny! Penny, please. Penny, please, wake up. We've got a gas leak. Let's get these people out. He's gone. We've got to get the mother and the daughter out of there fast. Daddy? Penny? Penny, you'll be okay. The nice fireman... is coming to get you, dear. Don't be afraid. No! We were going to build a snowman. I'm sorry, what did you say? That's why we were going up. I'd never seen snow before. You wanna see plenty of snow up there come this time tomorrow. Cutoff low is setting in overnight. Weatherman says it might be as much as three or four feet. Maybe we should just go home. It sounds like a pretty bad storm. Penny, is that what you want? To come out all this way just to turn around and go home? When you first came to see me six months ago, you said all you wanted was to live a normal life, and that you would do whatever it took to get you there. Isn't that what you said? And what did I tell you in our first session, that very first day? Own it. I have to own it. That's right. It has to be your choice. Beating our fears and phobias is all about helping ourselves, and no amount of counseling is going to help you unless you want to help yourself. I do. I want to. I have to. I'm not going to ride my stupid bicycle everywhere for the rest of my life. You have to confront your fears head on, and the only way you can completely do that is to-- Complete the circle. Go back to where it all began. Okay, what do you say we get back in the car... and go on with our journey? Don't forget your breathing exercises. Relaxation tape number four. - You know the drill. - Face forward in a seated position, eyes closed, arms resting comfortably by your side, allowing your mind to clear itself of any outside stimuli. Now repeat after me and try to visualize a giraffe... ...Buffalo... My throat's pretty dry. There's some bottled water in the back. ...Coyote-- What's this? For when we build that snowman. You should write a book about me. Tell the world what a freak Penny Deerborn is. Penny, after everything we've been through together, I'd like to think you've moved beyond feeling sorry for yourself. Why don't you spare both of us the poor-pitiful-me routine and tell me what's really bothering you? It wouldn't have anything to do with all those phone calls you're not answering, would it? I'd rather not talk about it. It's going to be a long couple of hours ahead if we don't talk to one another. Ben. He lives in my building, that's who's calling. I see. And why is this Ben calling you? To ask me out. There's nothing surprising about that. You're a very pretty girl. - Don't you like him? - Just the opposite. So then what's the problem? I can just imagine me on our first date. "Hi, it's good to see you. Oh, what a nice car. Excuse me while I throw up." I just don't see the point in starting something I can't finish. I remember being your age. Freshman in college-- I had a very serious crush on this gorgeous guy in my English Lit class. Only I was totally convinced that he didn't even know I existed. I mean, he was the quarterback of the football team, and I was just a lowly freshman with curly hair and a funny nose. You don't have a funny nose. No, you couldn't have convinced me of that back then. So what happened? I married him. I like that story. The only limitations in this life are the ones we put on ourselves, Penny. What was that? It's just a pothole. It's okay. Remember to breathe. Okay, relaxation. Penny? Penny! Penny, you didn't take something, did you? What? We agreed no sedatives. No more self-medicating, remember? Yes. I mean, yes, I remember. No, I didn't take anything. I was just-- just trying to do what you told me and relax. You know, if you took something, it negates everything that we're trying to do here. Orianna, I'm telling you the truth. - Honest. - Okay. Then you won't mind emptying out your pockets. Just as I thought. This is shit. This defeats the whole purpose of this trip, and you know it. You have to trust in the process, Penny. You have to trust me. I just-- I didn't think I'd make it through without it. I'm so disappointed in you. We might as well just turn the car around and head right back-- Look out! Are you okay? Oh, God. Are you all right? Do you need a ride somewhere? He seems to be all right. I just grazed him. Oh, thank God. That was close. What did he say? The poor guy's so cold, he could barely speak above a whisper. He said something about needing a lift to a camp near Onyx Pass. - You're going to give him a ride? - I just hit him. We're lucky he's not calling the police. The least we can do is give him a ride. It's freezing out there. Okay. Everybody all set? It's cold out there, right? You must have been freezing. So I'm Orianna and this is Penny. Penny, would you like to listen to another tape? No, I'm fine. If you're hungry, there's an apple in the bag back there. It's okay. It's just another pothole. I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous. - Cars make me nervous. - But you're getting better. No, actually, I'm more than a little nervous. I'm petrified. I have amaxophobia. It's a fear of cars. Orianna is my doctor. She says its more common than you would think. Have you-- have you ever-- have you ever heard of it? No, I guess not. I'll just stop talking. # Don't come knocking on my door # # 'Cause there'll be no more cryin' to me # # I heard he tore your heart in two... # Remember your breathing exercises. # Was it anything like me and you? # # Did he leave when things weren't working out # # And there was nothing you could do? # # And did he say, "We'll still be friends" # # And "I'll love you till the end"? # # Don't come back cryin' to me # # When your new love sets you free # # Don't come knockin' on my door # # 'Cause there'll be no more cryin' to me... # Oh, uh, no thank you. I'm not very hungry right now, but thank you. # You say you want another chance... # No, thank you, I'm fine. # That you've learned about true romance # # But I know about the games you play # # And all along how you would never stay... # We're getting close to Onyx Pass. So, um... it doesn't look like the camp is open. You said you work here, right? Not much of a talker. I don't see any lights or anything. You want us to drop you here? Jesus, what a creep! Everything's okay, Penny. Everything's okay. We're gonna be okay. Come on, honey, breathe. Good, breathe. Oh, God. I think I'm going to be sick. Penny, come on. Get back in the car. Penny, come on. - Oh, God. - Penny, get in! All right, hey-- this is no time to panic. We have to get back to a highway before that tire goes completely flat. Okay okay. Shh. Okay okay okay. Listen to me. Penny, Penny, Penny, look at me. Look at me. All right, I want you to count-- one-- Breathe in. Breathe in. Breathe out, that's right. That's good, let it go. I wanna go home. I know, honey, so do I, but first we have to get back in the car. - No no. - Penny! Penny, Penny. I want you to visualize that beach, the place you love. Come on. The sun is warming your skin. It's making you feel good. - I'm so cold. - No, it's not cold. It's hot now. It's hot, the way you like it on the beach in the middle of July. Listen-- the sun, the sand, the water. Now, Penny, I want you to turn around and look at the car. - It can't hurt you. It's just a car. - No! Penny, you have to do what I'm telling you! We've got to get back in the car! Okay, I'm leaving! No. Come on, come on, come on! - I hurt my ankle. - All right. We'll get some ice on it as soon as we get to the inn. Penny, Penny, can you clean off the back window? I can't see a thing. Just do it! I need to know if he's following us. Oh, hell. Cell phone. Where's my cell phone? Damn it. - No, don't leave me here! - I just have to check the tire. The tire's completely destroyed. Damn it. - The spare's no good. - What are we going to do? Keep trying to use the cell phone. Come on, grab the coats. Oh, and turn off the headlights. Ow. Oh, come on. Let me see, let me see. Oh. Wait, it's not good. If you put more pressure on it, it'll just get worse. No, I'm fine. I'm fine, I can walk. No, listen to me. I won't leave you. I just need to try and get a signal. I won't go far. If it doesn't work, I'll come right back, - and we'll think of something else. - No no no. - Damn it! - Penny, come on. Get back in the car. Just sit in here, lock the doors. - You'll be warm and safe inside. - Please don't-- - don't-- please don't go. - Penny, I have to. There's no other choice. I won't be long. You'll see. What if he's still out there? We're a mile away from him now. He's a coward playing games. If he really wanted to hurt us, he would have done it when he was in the car. - Orianna, please stay. - Just stay in the car. Keep the doors locked and the windows rolled up. Come on. Here, take this. - What am I supposed to do with it? - Just take it. It's pepper spray. - Don't go! - Two minutes, that's all. I'll be back in two minutes. emergency, please. Yes, hello? I-- Shit shit! Penny? Ostrich... Crocodile... Orianna? Orianna? Shit. Orianna? Orianna? Was that you? Orianna? Orianna! Orianna? Why didn't you take me with you? Weatherman's telling us we may see thunder and lightning as the storm moves in, sending temperatures plummeting well below zero. And now, back to more music on Mountain-95. Son of a bitch. What's the matter? Somebody killed Becky Simpson over at the diner this morning. - No shit. - Yeah. Run a meat skewer clean through her neck. Damn. Poor Becky. They got any idea who did it? Somebody that didn't like her meatloaf would be my guess. That's not funny, Eddie. No, I guess not. Found a guy in the trunk of a car parked out front too. Some businessman from down in the flats-- made hamburger out of his face with a tire tool and stuffed him in the trunk of his own car. What the hell is this world coming to? Coming to an end would be my guess. All you gotta do is read the paper to know that. Sin, misery everywhere you look. That's a little drastic, don't you think? With everybody killing each other, robbing, lying... fucking somebody else's wife. You got something to say to me, Eddie, let's hear it. # You just come back now, steady-- # We got work to do. Come on, we gotta secure this camp before that storm sets in. No, come on, Eddie. You wanna say something to me? Get it out. You say you cut through them woods every day on that old logging road out there, - 'cause it's a shortcut, right? - Yeah, that's right. It shaves about 20 minutes off my walk to work. All right. All right, that makes sense. What doesn't make sense is why you're spending all your break time out in them woods. It wouldn't have anything to do with Mary Saunders, now would it? Like you said, we got work to do. Look, all I'm saying is a small town like this, you can't get away with anything. You'd better think twice before you go diddling some other man's wife. Thanks, Eddie. I'll keep that in mind-- if I ever think about diddling some other man's wife. Orianna? Where are we? Penny? Penny, is that you? I told you to stay in the car. Come on, this isn't funny. Get that light out of my eyes. Penny! Penny? Oh, God! Oh God! No! Oh, God! Somebody help me! Somebody please! Somebody help me! Somebody! Somebody! Please... Please. No-- somebody. Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Somebody! Oh, God! Help me! Somebody help me! Somebody, please! It's just a dream. It's just a dream. It's just a bad bad bad dream. It's... it's a dream, a dream. Why didn't I listen to you, right, Orianna? "Stay in the car." That's what you said, right? Someone's gonna come help me, right, Orianna? Right? Someone has to come. They have to come. You should have stayed in the car, but you didn't. Ben, thank God! Penny? I can barely hear you. - Ben! - We have a bad connection. - Listen to me! - I'll call you back later. Ben, no! Wait wait wait! Oh, no! No! What do you want from me? No! No! Jesus, Alvin! You scared the shit out of me. Unlock the door. It's cold out here. # Lordy Lordy Lord, I could make her mine # # Lovin' lovin' lovin' just to sleep again # # It won't stop there, I'm gonna love you # # Don't stop it # # Don't turn it down # # Lordy, Lordy, Lord-- # # Lordy, Lordy, Lord, play it all night-- # Over here! Over here, help me! Over here! Over here, somebody. Hello! # Just move those thighs-- # Over here! Hey hey! Somebody! Hey, over here! I gotta get going. I thought you had an hour break. No, gotta call the wife. She's been acting a little funny lately. I'm starting to think she's onto us. On top of that-- Eddie knows. Eddie? How? He's not stupid, you know? He just acts that way. Well, hell with Eddie. And your wife. - I can't. - How about after work? - Here? - No. - I gotta take the kids to school. - Oh hell, Alvin. When are you going to stop working this stupid night shift? I don't know. When I win the lottery. Then why don't I meet you back here again tomorrow night? Okay? I gotta go. Not without a good-night kiss. Wait wait. - What? - Did you hear that? I thought I heard something. No! God! God! - It sounded like a car honking. - I don't hear anything. # You know, you know # # You know-- # Shit! Come on, get up. Let's check your other pocket. I think we're going to have to do this the hard way. I'm sorry. Work with me, Orianna, okay? Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh my God! - What the hell happened? - Wait wait wait! Please please! I can't hear you. Roll down the window. Please please! He's out there somewhere. You have to help me. Who? Who's out here? The hitchhiker. He killed Orianna. Please? No no. There's nobody out here but me. Please, just help me. What the fuck? I can't, okay? - I can't get you out of here by myself. - Please? No, look, the car-- it's wedged in here tighter than a drum, okay? And your front tire over there is completely blown out. Please! All right, listen. I'm just going to get someone to help, okay? No no no-- please please, don't leave me. Just don't leave me. Get me out of here, please. Look, I'll be back in a jiffy, okay? Just hold on. No, he's going to kill me. What? Who? The hitchhiker. I told you, okay? There's nobody out here but us. He's out there somewhere. He's probably watching us. I can't take it anymore. I can't breathe. I'm dying here. Please! All right. All right. - Do you got gas? - I got gas, I think so. Okay okay. Look, you're going to have to work with me here, all right? - Can you do that? - I think so. All right. Okay. Turn the car on. Crap. Look, it's all right. Just try it again, okay? All right, all right, all right. Oh crap! Crap! Okay, look, we gotta do this fast. - Real fast, okay? - Mister, I can't drive. It's simple, okay? It's simple. Put your foot on the brake, and then just pull the gear in reverse, okay? - Can you do that? - I don't know. Give it a try, okay? Just pull it to "R." Okay, when I say, you gotta step on that accelerator like hell. - All right, you got it? - I got it. - Can we hurry because I can't breathe? - I'm on it. I'm on it. Hold this for a minute, okay? Okay, are you ready? Okay, now! Here we go! Mister? Mister? Mister? Mister, where are you? Come on. Come on! Come on! # We've gotta go # # Get inside my helicopter... # Alvin! Alvin, what's going on? Is everything okay? I have to go home. I can't stay out here all night. # Take your hand and tell you it's all right # # I wanna be the one to hold you tight # # And whisper words of love # # And while I'm thinking of you, I wanna be the one... # Damn it, Alvin, where the hell are you? This ain't funny. We've got work to do. # How I wish that you were mine... # Penny? - Mama? - Everything is going to be okay. Mama? Am I dead? Don't you worry, baby. Mama's here now. Orianna? Turn on the lights. I can't see. No! Fuckin' North Pole out here. You dumb shit, Alvin. You and your fuckin' stupid fuckin' girlfriends. Shit! Oh oh! Oh my God! Dear God! Oh my God! No! Wow-- I-- no! No no. Oh, no. No! Ostrich. Antelope. Rhinoceros. Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit. Don't die on me! Don't! Who's out there? The only limitations in this life are the ones we put on ourselves, Penny. I won't die like this. You hear me? I said I won't die like this. I can do this. I gotta do this. Get-- I can do this. Come on! Yes! Yes! We did it! I think we did it. We did it. Oh my God! No! Stop! Oh, stop! Oh God! Penny. This little piggy went to market. This little piggy stayed home. This little piggy went, "Boo-hoo-hoo, you cut me to the bone." Who are you? Who are you?! Who are you?! Let-- oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Show your face, you coward! You have to own it, right, Orianna? Face your fears. Full circle. Some journey. Bon voyage. Jesus. Why'd you have to pick up the stranger? The trunk's open. No! I'm so sorry, Orianna. If it wasn't for me and my stupid fears, you'd still be alive. But I guess ultimately there is only one thing we're all afraid of. Isn't that right? You know what? All of a sudden I'm not so afraid anymore. I'm sorry. Penny? Hi! Don't forget your breathing exercises, Penny! Let me o-ooooout! Police have identified fingerprints at the diner belonging to an escaped mental patient known only as-- # Too long, sugar, too long-- # Oh my God! Damn! Are you all right? Are you all right? Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh! Oh, Jesus! Come with me. Come on. Come on, let's get you out of the road. Jeez. Come on. There you go. Oh, Jesus. What the hell are you doing in the middle of the road? # Who do you think you're talking to? # # Were you alone and... # # Do your moves line up on the pole? # # You shut up and watch what the fuck you say # # Stay away, 'cause I don't mind losing # # Shut up and watch what the fuck you say # # Stay away or you just might end up dead # # Is that the way you choose? # # You should have listened to your friends # # They were trying to protect you # # Shut up and watch what the fuck you say # # Stay away, 'cause I don't mind losing # # Shut up and watch what the fuck you say # # Stay away or you just might end up dead... # # You just might end up dead... # # It doesn't matter when you leave this place # # I know exactly when you sleep # # Will your friends be there tonight? # # You never wait to see me # # Shut up and watch what the fuck you say. #
