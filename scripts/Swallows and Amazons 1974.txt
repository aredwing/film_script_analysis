[Mother:] At least camels don't need water. When I was a child, we had thousands of sheep that died during the drought. - In Australia? - Yes. Sheep must be quite pleased to be English. Do they have sheep in China? Of course. Well, even if Daddy misses this holiday, he'll see Chinese sheep when he gets to Hong Kong. Where is he now, Mother? His boat's in Malta, waiting for orders to sail. I expect he'd rather be with us. Of course he would. He loves the lakes. He'd be showing you everything. He'd say: "Just look at that scenery." [Train whistle] [Children laugh] [Orchestral music] [Titty:] Please, can we go exploring? [Mother:] It's a little late. [Titty:] But it's still light. We won't be long. [Mother:] All right, but it'll soon be supper time. [Roger:] Hello, sir. [Man:] Hello. [Orchestral music] [John:] 'Dear Father, we arrived safely. 'Mother says I'm to ask your permission 'to build camp on the island on the lake. 'We have found a boat that will be quite suitable for the voyage. 'Hope you have a happy voyage to Hong Kong. 'Please answer soon. Love, John.' [Susan:] 'P.S. And Susan.' [Titty:] 'If we wreck ourselves on a coral reef, 'we will go down bravely. 'Not that we will. 'Please. Love, Titty.' [Roger:] 'Please, Daddy, may I go too?' [Roger:] Stand by to go about. Ready, about. [Birds chirping and bees buzzing] [Cows mooing] Stand by to go about. Ready, about. Stand by to go about. Ready, about. Roger! Well sailed. ls it the answer? Does it say yes? [Chickens clucking] "Better drowned than duffers, if not duffers, won't drown." - Does that mean yes? - I think so. But does that mean me too? Yes, if John and Susan will take you. And if you do as you're told. - Shall I go and tell the others? - All right. Don't be late for supper. [Dog barks] And don't wake Vicky when you come in. [Orchestral music] Despatches. It's yes, and for me too, so it must be for Titty as well. Read it aloud. "Better drowned than duffers, if not duffers, won't drown." - Hurrah for Father! - What does it mean? [John:] lt means, that Father thinks we won't drown, but if we do, good riddance. But what does "duffers, if not duffers" mean? No, you're wrong. lt says, if we were duffers we might as well be drowned. Then it stops and starts again, saying as we are not duffers, we won't drown. But why doesn't he just say yes? [Orchestral music] [Susan:] Mrs Jackson, can we borrow a frying pan? Yes, certainly, love. I'm best at buttered eggs. Are you really? Most folk are best at boiled. I don't really count boiled. [Mother:] You see, on rocky ground stones are better than pegs for holding tents down, except in a high wind. Father and I often used to sleep in one when we were young. Are you really old? Not really, it's just I was younger then. [Mother:] Oh! [All laugh] Da-dit, da-dit, da-dit-dit-dit. [John:] Hoist the sail, Mr Mate. [Susan:] Aye aye, sir. Here comes good Queen Bess to see us off on our voyage to the Pacific. Captain Drake, pull the boom down. That'll get those cross wrinkles out. I wonder if, the real Queen Elizabeth knew much about ships. That Queen Elizabeth wasn't brought up close to Sydney harbour. [Susan:] All aboard. [John:] Come on, let's go. - Right! - Have you got everything? - I've checked the list. Everything? One might almost say, "By gum, we couldn't have lit a fire without them." Safe voyage. - Bye-bye. [Children:] Goodbye. Goodbye. Three cheers for the stay-at-homes. Hip-hip... [Children:] Hooray! - Hip-hip, [Children:] Hooray! - Hip-hip, [Children:] Hooray! [Mother:] Bye! Adieu and farewell To you fair Spanish ladies Adieu and farewell To you ladies of Spain For we're under orders for to sail to old England And we may never see you fair ladies again We will really, though. [Orchestral music] [Titty:] Here we are, intrepid explorers making the first ever voyage into uncharted waters. What mysteries shall they hold for us? Dark secrets shall be revealed. [Orchestral music continues] [Roger:] Look, John, over there. Steamer ahead. [John:] Stand by to go about. Ready, about. Natives! [Orchestral music] [Roger:] A ship! A ship! [John:] It's a houseboat. What's a houseboat? A boat which you live in, like a house. I wish we lived in a houseboat all the year round. - Father does. - That's different. He's in the Royal Navy. A destroyer isn't like a houseboat. They live in it all the same. What's that man doing? [Roger:] I can't see. Why not? I can't see anything. Take the cap off the end. [Roger:] Oh, he's writing. [Titty:] Let me have the telescope. He's got a parrot. He's probably a retired pirate. [Roger:] Pirates always have parrots. [Titty:] He's working on his devilish crimes. [Roger:] It's my turn now. He's got a cannon. He is a pirate! Keep still, you two. You'll turn us over. [Orchestral music] [Titty:] There's another island. They've got India rubber necks. [Roger:] What? What can you see? [Titty:] Cormorants. We must be near the coast of China. The Chinese have cormorants. They train them to catch fish for them. Daddy sent me a picture. [Susan:] They're fishing now. Look! Land ahoy! Land ahoy! [John:] Stand by to go about. Ready, about. Keep a lookout for a good landing place. Aye aye, sir. And keep a good lookout for savages too. Boy Roger, sing out like anything if you see any rocks under the water. [Roger:] Aye, sir. [Orchestral music continues] [Susan:] How about there for a landing place? [John:] Let's try. Stand by to go about. Ready, about. [Orchestral music continues] Get the painter. [Birds chirping] [John:] Susan, you come forward and take this halyard. [John:] Lower away. Don't let's unpack now, let's explore. [Seagulls cawing] [Titty:] Might be a tidal wave. [Roger:] Look! Properly we ought to have a flagpole on the top. [Roger:] What for? To hoist a flag, for a signal. lt would make a superb lighthouse. If any of us were sailing home after dark we could hoist a lantern up there. [Roger:] We've got a lantern. - We haven't got any rope, though. - We could get some. Good idea. Let's go look for a camp now. OK, we'll split up. Roger, you go that way, Susan that way, Titty, you go that way and I'll go this way. [Roger:] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What a lovely place for a camp. Well done, Roger. Natives. Well, the natives certainly knew how to choose the right place. Suppose they're still here. These ashes look pretty old to me. I think we're safe. Come on, let's fetch the tents. [Orchestral music] [Susan:] You'll need much more than that. [Orchestral music continues] [Whistle] [Muffled giggles] Shh. [All: laugh] Lovely. You can see the fireplace from inside. Everything's all right apart from the landing place. Everybody can see it. Titty, let's go and see if we can find a better harbour. Oh, I'd better have the whistle. [Roger:] Oh, can I come? [Susan:] No, you fill a kettle while I unpack. That's got scum in it. Come on, I'll show you how to do it. [Titty:] We ought to have brought machetes like Red Indians use. Ow! [John:] Wow! Come on, let's get Swallow. Look, all you have to do is put the spout in the water and no scum comes in. [Orchestral music] [Banging] [Whistle] [Whistle] [Titty:] I expect someone hid on the island hundreds and hundreds of years ago and kept their boat here. [John:] It's perfect for keeping Swallow safe at night. [Susan:] It's marvellous, but why didn't we see it before? [John:] Oh, the rocks go out so far. John, why have you put this cross here? I didn't. lt must have been here already. Natives again. Or cannibals. This marks the spot where they ate six missionaries. Oh, the tea'll spoil. Come on. Ooh, sorry. We can begin our chart tomorrow, and put on it everything we discover. We'll invent our own names. [John:] Of course we will. Roger, eat your apple. Must I? Yes, Mother says we must eat plenty of green things or else we'll all get scurvy. What is scurvy? Sailors die from it like flies. Are you all right? Susan, Titty? [Titty:] Aye aye, sir! ls the boy all right? [John:] He's all right, Mr Mate. You ready for lights out yet? Yes! Lights out. Good night. [Roger:] Good night. [Birds chirping] [Titty:] Hello. Hello. Where's Susan? [Titty:] Asleep. [John:] No, she isn't. And she's going bathing. [Susan:] Time to get the milk, John. [Orchestral music] [Roger:] It's cold. [Susan:] No, it isn't, it's lovely. Don't just splash, swim. [Cows mooing] [Dog barking] [Woman:] Mind now. If there's anything else you want, don't be afraid to come and ask for it. [Man:] Grand weather we're having. Shoo. You just get those dirty boots out of my clean dairy. Ooh. I've had a good morning. Here, you want some? - Tobacco? - No, bless you. Bait for when you go fishing. Good bit of perch down by the weeds. How far down is your hook, Susan? Just about as far as my float will let me. Mine's only three feet down. That's no good. lt should be about a foot from the bottom. Reel it in and I'll push your float up for you. John, your float's gone! It's a shark! It's a shark! - It's a shark! It's a shark! - Pull! - Pull it hard! - Go on, pull it in! Go on! Pull! - Pull! - Pull! Do you think it's really safe to bathe in this place? [Susan:] I wouldn't like to be a fish. [Roger:] But I'd like to be a fish swimming underwater. [Titty:] You'll be like that soon. It'll have to be, Arctic for the north and Antarctic for the south. What shall we call the town? [Titty:] Why not Rio? [Roger:] Why Rio? Because of the song. "Away to Rio". What about the bay where we fished? Dixon's Bay. It's very near the farm. No, Shark Bay because of Roger's great fish. [John:] What shall we call the place where we saw the houseboat? In this bay here. [Titty:] Houseboat Bay. [John:] Hm. I wonder if the retired pirate is working on his treasure charts. [Typing] [Roger:] Do you think he's the only retired pirate on board? [Titty:] Oh, maybe others below deck. Slaves he gets to do all the dirty work. He has an easy life, I bet. [Bang] [Parrot squawks] [John:] Come on! [Dog barking] [Titty:] He must have fired his cannon. [Susan:] Look over there! [Roger:] Who are those two boys? [John:] Get down. They may be enemies. [Roger:] Ow! They're pirates. [Roger:] Let's chase them. [Susan:] Let's. Come on, then. [Titty:] If they are pirates, why did the pirate on the houseboat fire at them? [Susan:] Perhaps he didn't. [Titty:] He must have. [Roger:] He's got a cannon and the others haven't. [John:] They're going round the island. Let's go that way and head them off. [Orchestral music] [Roger:] Why is he waving? [Titty:] He's not waving, he's very angry. [Orchestral music continues] [John:] A-M, Am, A-Z-O-N, Amazon! [Roger:] Hurry! Hurry! We're losing them. [Susan:] They must be making for Rio. [Band playing] [Seagulls cawing] They've given us the slip. Hm. Let's go and explore Rio. We could buy the rope for the lighthouse tree. [John:] Roger, you stay here and look after Swallow. Beware of natives. [Light music on radio] And four bottles of grog, please. [Susan:] Ginger beer. [Man:] It's a lovely day. Yes, isn't it? [Shop bell] [Band playing jaunty tune] [Children playing] [Man:] That's a nice little ship you've got there. [Roger:] Yes. [John:] Anything to report, Boy Roger? [Roger:] A native came along and said, "That's a fine boat you've got there." [John:] What did you say? I said, "Yes." [Susan:] Roger, put them back, they're for supper. Natives are quite good at some things. You are a greedy little pig, Roger. Why did the native on the houseboat shake his fist at us today? Perhaps this is his island. [Rustling] What was that? Oh, nothing. Probably a bird. If this is his island then why doesn't he live on it? Much nicer for his parrot. [Thunk] Don't touch the point, it might be poisoned. [John:] Shh! It's him again. He's winged his arrows with that poor parrot's feathers. Shut up, Titty. We'll split up and search. We'll need a signal. One hoot like an owl means it's all right, three hoots means something's up. Come on, I'll take the landing place. [Titty:] Come on, Roger. [Hoots once] [Distant hoot] [Distant hoot] [John:] Swallow's gone! [Three distant hoots] Me and Roger pulled her right up. She couldn't have drifted off. [Children's voices in distance] Hooray! Hurrah! Hurrah! [Child:] Halt. Hands up. [John:] Down on your faces. [Woosh - woosh] The Amazons. They're girls. [Thwish - woosh] [Girl:] Stand up. Now hands up. [John:] Before they reload, charge! [All shout] [John:] Halt. A parley. [Girl:] All right, then. No tricks. - What have you done with our ship? - Where's Swallow? She's our prize. She's in our harbour. Our harbour. Your harbour? How long have you been here? Days and days. This is Wildcat Island. It's been our island for years and years. Who built the fireplace? Who marked the harbour? A white cross. Anybody could put a white cross on a tree. Shows it's our island. You don't even know how the harbour's marked. We, we do. Come on, then. Let's parley. Weapons down. Peggy, you donkey, they've got our knife. [Roger:] I found it. It's our knife. lt was a present from Uncle Jim. We polished the cannon on his houseboat. Shut up, Peggy. ls he your Uncle? We thought he was a retired pirate. That's quite a good thing for him to be, really. He can be Captain Flint. [Titty:] But you're pirates too. That's why he hates us. He knows what pirates are. It's time for the parley. I'm John Walker, Master of the Swallow. Susan, Mate, Able Seaman Titty and the Boy Roger. I'm Nancy Blackett, Master and part-owner of the Amazon. The terror of the seas. This is Peggy Blackett, Mate and part-owner of the same. Her name isn't Nancy really, it's Ruth, but Uncle Jim says the Amazons were ruthless. I'll shiver your timbers if you don't stop chattering Peggy. Let's be allies against Captain Flint and all the natives. You see, Captain Flint used to be friendly, but now he's worse than any native because he's writing a book and he says he hasn't time for us. If we're allies it doesn't matter who the island belongs to. You see, there ought to be two marks, but two white crosses would be too easy for anyone to guess. So what's your other mark, then? This tree here. When you want to sail into the harbour, keep the cross here and the tree in a straight line and you'll come clean through the rocks. [Peggy:] He bought the parrot in Zanzibar. He's been all over the world, you know. Mother said he was the black sheep of the family. Last year he came home and he said he'd gathered enough moss and meant to settle here. Mother's his sister, you know. Last year he was one of us and even bought us Amazon. This year he said he was writing a book and refused to join in. He's in league with the natives. We've tried everything to wake him up, but it's no good. It's ended by him forbidding us ever to go near him. - Did he really fire at you today? - No, that was us. lt was the most marvellous banger left over from last November. lt was a jolly good bang. Let's plan a combined attack on Captain Flint. - Who'll be captain? - I will, of course. John's our captain. [Peggy:] There can only be one captain. - Then it should be me. There are more of us Swallows than there are you Amazons. Let's fight for it. We'll try and capture each other's ships. That'll be good practice. Whoever wins will be flagship. We'll win. But where do you keep your boat? You go north across the wide open sea till you come to our river. - The Amazon. Then you'll see our boathouse, and that's where we live. The only trouble is the Amazons know the lake much better than we do. Yes, like those marks in the harbour. If there was only something we could do and they couldn't, that would be a help. Got it! Leading lights. Roger, go into our tent and get the lantern. Oh, and bring a hammer and two large nails. Look. There they are. [John:] Are they in line yet? [Susan:] No, the top light's a little to the left of the lower. [John:] Sing out when they're above each other. [Susan:] Left a little. Now! Left. Keep left. Right. [Boat scrapes on pebbles] We've done it! This will win us the war. The Amazons think they're safe from us at night. [John:] Oh, well. No war today. - We can row. - Too far. We'll have to wait until tomorrow. We can do something else instead. - What? - We can go and explore. - Where? - Over there on the mainland. [Titty:] lt must be Niagara. We could get a barrel and bounce down it. [John:] Not today! [Roger:] It's a real forest. [Titty:] A jungle, almost. [Susan:] We'd better keep together. [Roger:] It's almost as good as a monkey. [Titty:] If only there were some parrots. [Bird pecking] [Roger:] Woodpeckers. They'll do. They're savage parrots. They're saying "Pretty Polly" in savage language. [Roger:] Look, a Red Indian wigwam. [Old man:] Hello, you. Come to have a look, have you? [John:] Good morning. [Sighs] Oh, it's blowing up a bit. Want to have a look inside, do you? Folk generally want to. [Titty:] May we? [Coughs] [Old man:] Sit down. [John:] Do you always live here? [Old man:] Aye. When we're burning charcoal someone has to keep the fire down, like, day and night. That way the charcoal is smooth and black and good to use. For artists to draw masterpieces with? [Laughs] That's right, lass. Try a bit. Would you like to see what we keep for luck? What is it? A snake. Would you like to see it? [All:] Yes, please. You're sitting on it. [Titty gasps] [Laughs] [Old man coughs] Young Billy! Dad been showing you around, has he? [Roger:] ls he your son? - That's right. [Roger:] He doesn't look much like a son. [Man:] There. Come on. [Snake hisses] [Snake hisses] ls it safe to touch? I wouldn't. Never go near an adder. Mind how you're stepping in the woods. There's plenty about. If you happen to step on one, he'll bite. But he'll get out of the way if he hears or sees you. Oh, look there. A little bit of a hole. Out he comes. Like the adder, is fire. - Are you camping on the island? - Yes. You had those Blackett lasses with you yesterday, hadn't you? We saw their little boat. I can remember when their mother and Master Jim used to come up here. They were no bigger than you are. The man on the houseboat? Aye. Captain Flint. We're going to fight with him. Quiet, Roger. You know, Dad, I think it'd be a good thing if we let him know what folks are saying. Aye, you're right. [Wind blowing] Will you be seeing those lasses again? Yes, as soon as there's the wind for sailing. What's wrong with today? Well, this morning on the lake there was a dead calm. Never mind. You tell them to tell their Uncle Jim. - But they can't, they're at war with him. [Man:] They'll tell him right enough. You tell 'em to tell him that Young Billy, that's me, sent him word to put a good, strong padlock on that houseboat of his if he's gonna leave it alone at nights. Down in the pub there's too much talking about that houseboat and the valuables inside. There's plenty of wild young lads that are up to anything without thinking twice. We'll tell them. Thank you very much for having us. [Titty:] And thank you so much for letting us see your lovely serpent. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. [Roger:] Goodbye. [Old man:] Here! Thank you. - Goodbye. - Bye. [Susan:] In! In! In! Pull! In! Pull! In! Pull! Go on, give it your back! Go on, pull. In! Pull! In! Pull! What is it, John? How can I give a message to Captain Flint? He's our enemy now. "Called to tell you that you had jolly well better leave my houseboat alone. Once is quite enough. No joking. James Turner." [Titty:] But we never touched his horrible houseboat. He is a beast. You'd better go and see him, John. Let's go and sink his beastly houseboat. No, Susan's right. I'll go and explain and give him his message. And he's used my crayons too. Now, look here, did you find my note? Yes. - Can you read? - Yes. - Did you read it? - Yes. I told you to leave my houseboat alone. Now you're here again. - Clear out fast! - But I never. And if you've got any more fireworks, the best thing you can do is drop them in the lake. But I haven't. - Oh, that was the last one, was it? Well, you did enough damage with it. I've never had any fireworks. At least not since last November. Now, look here, that won't do. And I've never been near your boat. Well, never as near as this. Then who did set fire to her? Clear off. I've nothing more to say to you. But I came to tell you. Clear off. I don't like talking to liars. - And don't let me see you here again! [Orchestral music] Why do you wave your legs in the air, Titty? I'm trying to be a cormorant but it's quite difficult. Look, there's John. - Did you see the parrot? - Did you capture the houseboat? What did he say when you gave him the message? I didn't give him the message. He wouldn't let me. Did you declare war on him? [John:] No. He called me a liar. [Parrot squawks] [Parrot squawks] You can't get a fairer wind than this. Can we attack, then? In naval warfare two things are important, to know exactly what you want to do and to do it in the manner your enemy will least expect. Amazons, beware. It's a fair wind for the Swallows. All we have to do when they do come is to keep out of sight. And when they do come we'll slip away quietly, go to the island and when they return we'll take Swallow. How do we manage all that? Ah. [Titty:] Take care, John. [Seagulls cawing] [John:] A fine place for a lookout. Let me out some more rope. Tie the lantern on as I said and then we'll hoist it up. I still don't see how we surprise them. Well, with this wind they expect us to attack them and do it early enough to get back here in daylight. [Susan:] Yes, of course. [John:] But we don't. Not until dark, when they think we've given up. They don't know about our lights. Then, we sail up their river, find the boathouse, and pinch their boat. Then we sail both boats back here. But what happens if they attack us first? We'll watch and wait for them on the lake all day. Except me. I'll be staying here. Are you sure you can manage all on your own, Titty? Of course. I'd love to stay here. [John:] You light the lighthouse lantern and hoist it up as soon as it starts to get dark. The candles in the small lanterns won't last long so don't light them till you're sure we're coming. We'll give you an owl call to let you know it's us and not the enemy. Aye aye, sir. What do I do when I've left you on the island? It's obvious. You sail on to the next bay while I wait for Swallow, capture her and then come and join you. But I want to be there when you capture Swallow. You can't be in two places at once. lt is the most exciting part. What are you wearing? You said put two of everything on. [Susan:] I said bring, not put on two of everything. Pretend you're going to the North Pole. [Roger:] All aboard. - Don't forget about the lights, Titty. Aye aye, sir. Oh, oughtn't I to have the telescope for keeping watch? - Yes, I think you ought. - Thank you. Swallows forever! [Roger:] Good luck, Titty. [Orchestral music] "25 years ago this day I, Robinson Crusoe, was wrecked on this desolate place." [Bell rings] [Wind howling] [Banging and crashing] [Birds cawing] What a good place for a camp. I'll build my hut here with branches and moss. Can't be two tents for one shipwrecked mariner. Better not. I'll leave it for Man Friday, when I find him. Still a very Susan-ish tent. [Animal growling] [Animal growling] [Animal growling] I'll have to sleep up a tree for fear of ravenous beasts. I'm not afraid of ravenous beasts anyway. Time for a feast. [John:] Well, they can't have gone by. Come on, sun. Hurry up, sink. I hope Titty's all right. Man Friday! [John:] Well, here goes. [Susan:] They must have had supper ages ago. [John:] I wonder what they're up to. [Roger:] It's going to be quite dark soon. [Sizzling] I expect they've gone to meet the Blackett children. I'd heard you'd met them. Man Friday oughtn't to know anything about them. Very well. I won't. What are you doing all by yourself? Well, properly I'm in charge of the camp but while they're away it doesn't matter if I'm Robinson Crusoe instead. Man Friday, would you mind telling me some of your life before you came to this island? I was caught by some very savage, savages. - They put me in a huge stew pot and chanted strange songs. Then what? They lit a fire under the stew pot and began to dance all round me. What did you do? I waited, till no one was looking, then I jumped out of the stew pot, and escaped. Were you scalded badly? Badly, but I buttered the places that hurt most. [Gasps] What happens if they don't come? They're bound to. We just wait and watch. [John:] Now for the enemy stronghold. Quiet, everyone. Are you sure you'll be all right by yourself? They'll be back soon. Well, I hope so. It'll be dark fairly soon. Wouldn't you like to come back with me, just for tonight? We can leave a note for John. I'd rather stay, thank you. All right. Goodbye, Robinson Crusoe. Goodbye, Man Friday. [Orchestral music] Duffer. That's for looking too hard. Try the other eye. [John:] We're in the river. [Susan:] Any sign of the enemy's boathouse? [Roger:] No, Mr Mate. [John:] Shh. They mustn't hear us coming. [Peggy: quacks] [Susan:] What's that? [John:] A duck. Stow it, you goat. Don't overdo it. There it is! There it is! [Susan voiceless] (Shh. Be quiet.) "To the Swallows. Ha ha. The Amazon pirates. Quite simple. They've hidden her up the river. It's an old pirate trick. Shouldn't we be getting back, John? [Roger:] No. Let's go up the river. Please, John. [John:] lt wouldn't take long. We know they haven't put to sea. We have been watching all day. Wildcat Island and the Amazons forever! We've done them fairly brown. [John:] This must be the place they call the lagoon. It's just the place for them to hide their ship. Susan, you take the oars now. I'll keep a lookout. I wish it wasn't so dark, though. [Susan:] Something's pulling at my oars. [John:] It's all right, it's only water lilies. [Susan:] lt clings onto them like octopuses. [Roger:] Perhaps they were octopuses. Titty read out of a book how they put their arms out and grab people out of boats. [John:] Nonsense Roger, they're only flowers. [Roger:] I, I, I wouldn't mind even if they were octopuses. Look. Uncle Jim must be back. [John:] It's easier if you slope the oars down and forwards. That way they don't go deep in the water and get stuck. [Susan:] I can't move the tiller. [John:] lt, it's all stuck up with lily stalks between the rudder and the boat. They won't budge. [Susan:] Careful. [John:] Try now. [Roger:] There isn't any light at all. [Susan:] We'll never find the Amazon now. [John:] If we wait until morning we might find her. [Susan:] And what about Titty [John:] We'll go back. She'll be worried. [Peggy:] Look. What's that? [Nancy:] It's a lighthouse. Very thoughtful of them. - Stand by to jibe. - Aye aye, sir. [Owl hoot] [Owl hoot] [Hoots] - Are you cold, Roger? - Rather. [John:] Thank goodness we can sail at last. I'm going to raise the sail and reef. Even Father said not to be ashamed to reef a small boat in the dark. [Hoots] [Hoots] Almost exactly southeast. Now we'll have to tack all the way back, but short tacks so as not to hit the shore. But how are we going to know how far we've gone? I'll count 100 on each tack. Susan, you'd better snuggle down now. I'll take the main sheet. I'll need your help among the islands off Rio. One, two, three. Six, seven, eight. [Nancy:] Watch the boom, Peggy. Jolly good idea of theirs to put lights on the marks. What beats me is how they got here before us. [Peggy:] But they went up the river. They must have rowed like smoke. - It's unbelievable. - Hey! Why isn't Swallow in the harbour? They must have left her in the landing place, lit the lights and then scooted off to camp. I bet they'll pretend they've been there for hours and hours. Come on, let's give them a fright. Ahoy, Swallows! Swallows, ahoy! [Owl hoot] - Ahoy there, Swallows! - Swallows, ahoy! Swallows, ahoy! Ahoy! Swallows, ahoy! Where on earth are they? She must have drifted. - You can't have beached her properly. - Me? She can't have drifted against the wind. Then we've been done. They've outwitted us. - The Swallows? - Who else, you chump-headed galoot? What are we going to do? We should be in bed. - If we don't go to breakfast in the morning. - Oh, shut up, Peggy. 98, 99, Ready, about. One, two. [Roger:] Wouldn't Titty have liked this? Liked what? Sailing like this in the dark. [John:] Five, six, seven, eight, nine. [John:] 57, 58, 59, 60, [Wind blowing] What's the matter? Can't you hear it? The wind in the trees. We must be near the bank. Quick Susan, lower the sail. Roger catch the yard, it comes down. [Susan:] Ow! [John:] Give me the painter. It's a landing stage, thank goodness. What are we going to do now? Stay here till first light. What about Titty? She's at the camp. She'll be all right. She's got a tent. [Indistinct man's voice] [Man:] We must be near it now. [2nd man:] Not yet. Look at the light. Those kids are on the other island. Another 100 yards at least. - Damn! Blast! Give us a hand. I don't see why we couldn't have taken it with us. Ugh! Damn. That motorbike, we'll bring a car next week. Blast it. Why didn't you bring a chisel to smash it open? - It'll take more than a chisel. - Yeah. I just hope it'll be worth it. It's heavy enough. Whatever he keeps in there must be worth having. Come on, then. Let's get away from here. [John:] It's Amazon. [Susan:] She's adrift. [John:] No, she's at anchor. [Roger:] It's Amazon! It's Amazon! [John:] Shh. They must be asleep. [Roger:] It's Titty! It's Titty! I've got her! I've got her! [Susan:] Hooray! Well done! [John:] Well done, Titty! Hooray, we've won the war! [Orchestral music] Ahoy, Swallows! Ahoy! Look! [Nancy and Peggy:] Ahoy, Swallows! What are they doing? [Titty:] Nancy looks as if she's dancing with rage. What's that thing fluttering there? [Nancy and Peggy:] Swallows, ahoy! [Susan:] It's one of our blankets. They're surrendering! It's a white flag. lt doesn't look very white to me. Swallows! Swallows! [John:] Ready, about. Hurry up. Do you surrender? We jolly well do. But hurry up. [John:] No trickery. - Honest pirate. Honest Indian too? Honest Indian. Honest anything you like, but hurry up. We're supposed to be in bed. [John:] Captain Nancy, which ship is the flagship? Swallow is. Yours was a great plan. lt was luck, really. [John:] Titty was the real hero. By thunder, Able Seaman, I wish you were in my crew. Nancy, we must be going. Goodness, I forgot. We'll see you later. Mother says we can come and camp here tonight. - Bye. - Bye. Roger, time you were in bed. But it's tomorrow. I don't care if it's the day before yesterday. Quick march. Mother? I think I ought to talk to you. I'll say you should. Why were you back so late last night? You know, after I left Titty I spent a long time on the lookout for you. We didn't get back till morning. Oh, the Blacketts made you spend the night. Poor Titty. lt wasn't poor Titty at all. She did better than the rest of us. She captured the Amazon all by herself. Where were the Blacketts? On Wildcat Island. And where were you? Well, we were up the Amazon River, where they live, and it got too dark. We had to wait until it was light enough to see again. Don't you think, that was very nearly like being duffers? Well, it was rather, but it was war and our only chance. I promise we won't stay out at night again. Anyway, there's no need. The war's over and we've won. And nobody caught a cold or anything. All right. But no more sailing at night and no more scrapes of any kind. We've only got two days left and I don't want to hear of any of you getting into any more trouble. [Man:] Names and addresses, please. My name is John Walker. Name, Walker. - Address? - Here. - Where? - Here. Now, that won't do. Where do you live? In these tents. - Now, look here, stop this nonsense. You've gone too far this time, I've had enough. Enough of what, Uncle Jim? What the devil are you two doing here? What is going on? Now, then, Miss Nancy, your uncle's houseboat was burgled last night. He thinks these children done it. What rot. They never had anything to do with it. - They weren't even here last night. - We never did anything. The charcoal burners told us to warn you. And we rowed over to tell you. And you wouldn't listen. Well, what about that firework burning Mr Turner's roof, then, eh? - That was us, not the Swallows. - You deserved it. You haven't spoken to us all summer because of your stupid book. They tried to warn you, but you wouldn't listen. An now you've been burgled, it serves you right. You've been an awful pig to John. Young man, erm... it's altogether my fault. I should have known you were telling the truth. Anyhow, I should have listened to you. I'm very sorry. It's all right now. What a cross-grained, curmudgeonly idiot. If I'd listened to John. My boat looked as if half a hundred wildcats had had a scrimmage in it. And of course they took my cabin trunk. - Was it a heavy one? - lt was, rather. Did it have gold ingots in it? Afraid not. Typewriter, diaries, old log books. And worst of all, the book I've been writing. About your pirate past? Ah, well. [Titty:] Was it a very good book? - I doubt it. Now I might just as well not have written it. And been more friendly all summer. Don't rub it in. I didn't only come to warn you. I came to declare war on you as well. Oh, really? That's very friendly of you. Why not do it now? Better late than never. Or I'll do it for you. I challenge you to capture my boat at 3pm tomorrow afternoon. [Both:] Accept, accept! Blood and thunder, death or glory! He can be a jolly good pirate when he wants to. Well, I must be off. - Captain Flint I know where the treasure's hidden. - What? I heard some pirates burying it last night. Steady on, Titty. They had a huge box. lt was very heavy. You were dreaming. I wasn't. I heard them. lt was the middle of the night. Captain Flint, you must believe me, it's true. I only wish I could. Well, goodbye, Swallows and Amazons. [All:] Bye. Goodbye. - Bye. [Orchestral music] [Titty voiceless] [Orchestral music continues] Pull harder, Roger. [Roger:] Ow! My knee! [Titty:] Which knee was it? The one which I didn't scrape before. At least, not the one which got scraped last but the other one. [Seagulls cawing] [Titty:] Roger! Look, the treasure must be here. I found this. One of the pirates must have dropped it. [Titty gasps] We've found it! We've found it! [Bang] [John:] Lower sail as we come alongside. Grapple and board him. Swallow on port side, Amazon on starboard. He can't go for both of us. Fleet will now attack! Amazons forever! [All shout] [Bang] - Kill! - Death to Captain Flint! Death or glory! Down with the plunderers! Man the cutlasses! Death to Captain Flint! Swallows and Amazons forever! Agh! Down with the white elephant! [Shouts] Yield! Not while my flag flies. Elephants! Elephants forever! We've won! Your flag is struck! [All cheer] So it is. Well, that was quick work. Oh, I surrender. Bind him. Come on, bind him. [Jim:] No. [Jim: Groans and laughs] Don't laugh. Hands up for making him walk the plank. Look here, no weakening now. It's too good a plank to waste. Shouldn't we untie his hands and give him a chance to swim for it? All right, we agree. All hands up. Bandage his eyes and make him walk the plank. A clean handkerchief, I hope. Mine. Well, it was clean yesterday. Would someone help that pirate out of my helmet and put it on my head? A last wish. Whoops. Mercy, mercy! [Nancy:] Now walk, you son of a sea dog. Ohh! [All cheer] Perhaps he can't swim. I never thought of that. [Jim gasps] Sharks! Sharks! The place is stiff with them. Are there really sharks there? A rope! A rope! Agh! My foot! Are they ready yet? Nancy says, "Are you ready?" Almost. Just a moment. A rope! A rope! You hard-hearted pirates! A rope! He's been in the water a good long time. And you'll never be in league with the natives again? Never. A rope! All right, Nancy. We'll give you a rope. I'd rather have a rope ladder. There's one just there by the springboard. I mean the plank. A rope! Chuck the end over. [Jim groans] Well, that's that. [Coughs] Even Amazons aren't ruthless enough to make a man walk the plank twice in one day. Are all my sins forgiven? If so, after every great sea battle there's always a big banquet and there's one waiting for you inside. [All cheer] Captain Flint, we've got a surprise for you. And what's that, Able Seaman? My book! Goodness me. What a find! [All laughing] Say "Pieces of eight". Come on. "Pieces of eight". [Parrot:] Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly. You're not fit to be a pirate's parrot. The ices still seem pretty firm. I think we ought to start on them straightaway. Excuse me. Here you are, ladies. - John. - Thank you. - Roger. - Thank you. You mustn't eat ices after walking the plank. They'll give you a chill. By Jove, I suppose I shouldn't. You did walk the plank most awfully well. Practice. [All laugh] [Titty gasps] [Roger:] The Swallow and the Amazon! That's what they're supposed to be. There you are. It's jolly well not fair. It's schools and lessons for us while you junket about and enjoy yourself all the winter in Africa. I'm not enjoying myself. It's really quite a hard job. I wish I was going to Africa. I'd see forests full of parrots. I'll bring you back one. It's the least I can do. Which kind do you prefer? I like the green ones best. Oh, I may as well bring one all round for you if that's what you want. [Roger:] No, thank you. Please may I have a monkey instead? Oh! With or without a tail? Oh, with a tail, please. The others are only apes. lt has been a grand holiday. But much too short. Oh, cheer up. You're coming back next year, aren't you? Next year and for all the other years for ever and ever. Uncle Jim, do play your accordion. Mm! Say "Pieces of eight". Just once. Please. [Parrot croaks] Pieces of eight. Well, shiver my timbers. He never said it for us. I say, Titty, it is a long time to wait till I come back in the spring. Why not have Polly now? You always said you liked green ones. Am I really to take him? Of course you are. You've earned him ten thousand times over. Thank you. Thank you so much. But won't you be very lonely without him? I have to think of him too, you know. He is a young parrot and it's much better for him to be with young people like you than with an old retired pirate like me. He's not so very old. Come along, now. All sing. [Plays "Drunken Sailor"] What shall we do with the drunken sailor? What shall we do with the drunken sailor? What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
