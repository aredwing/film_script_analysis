I mean, I am a genius. -They housed me. -Oh, and I Pi-you Herman. Haha, that's ridiculous. No, no, I do not understand. You see, I was on the way to college. Vukovac, average 5.00, you know, I get a degree in biochemistry. Or applied mathematics. But things did not turn out like that. I come from a good, healthy, intellectually stimulating environment. A Blade, it's another character about whom I will talk ... Well, he ... It is the end ... -I see it, our lives have been opposed. -Yeah ... Wait, start from the beginning. Maybe this will help to clarify things. Duncan Piskila in the nose. While I looked on good behavior, Blade is free to let yellow streams. How many times have I told you so the refuge that matter! I was a real human sponge, absorbing wealth of knowledge that our world offers. Blade became the king of pornography. I was the perfect child who has learned to share. While he calls himself became hardened criminal. I have always looked in the future ... continue ... He has watched the neighborhood. I was on the right track the academic home of glory. Blade was on the right Road to Alcatraz. It was the summer before my senior year and we were moved to a new area. Can you forsake us. There are good candidates for strumming there in the corner. I was wrong. But one of us spent the summer with his brothers at his favorite resort. Be good to me, Blade! Dick Rijkaard, what a pleasant surprise. What's up, bro? Still trying to reduce your crime? And when I'm going to smoke here? When you solve to be nice guy, Michael. Stop with the "Michael" shit, You can not hold me here. I would not need to be here, whatever the law that I violated. Shut up! I'm a minor ... I am a black juvenile ... It starts me a headache, my ears bleed! Give more shut up. Just to let you know. Farkon not come here to pay bail for a small car thief. And I ask you to stay here as long as this figure does not look good. Hey, do not look at me like that! But I do wonder, a judge and let it out. You see, I'm talking about. Raise your tone and the people and listen. I am a free man. Power to the people! Wait, wait, wait. Not so fast. -Judge and let it out under certain conditions. -What kind of conditions? First, you have to go to school and to have good grades. Come on, man. Me and schools. It's like oil and vinegar. Do not mix up. -Oil and water. -No matter ... Watch out, it is very simple. You want to get out here, you have to go to school. You go to school, filled with 18 to the end of term. This means that you will not be minor. So, If you will not have good grades, or catch you in a fight or even how visi with his brothers, or how wipe your butt to the side, buddy ... It would be a violation of your probation and arrest him, and as an adult. How to wipe your butt to the side? What talk bre? Dude, you just do not love me? And, yes, I almost forgot. Judge you prepared a special gift before you go. That's what I'm talking about. That's all I wanted. Some respect. What is it? Fuck you! -Next it was ... The burger well looks. -And it tastes good, punk. Doctor Oppenheimer, Dr. Martin, from the heart I speak as a third Pinderhjuza generation. This is the culmination of his life's dream. Next: Raging beavers! Duncan, Haford has the most criteria for admission to the world. And the fact that you are perfectly did the entrance, had on average 5.00 what concerns us Hafordu, is not enough. -Excuse me! -Will to say that all Your achievements fall into the water If you have passed a physical in order to fulfill requirements for a diploma in high school. No diploma, no Haforda. We moved because we found a school that assesses physical only "pass / fail". -So I will not have to play the asthma. -Duncan has never been spotski type. As you can see, everything went well-oiled ... ... Until the first day of school. Mmm, ass bonus. Herman! Damn kids we are going to damn nerves. Jail bird. And that was it. The mistake that will change my life. -What do you say, how big were the boobs? Oh, they were ... Bre Wait a minute. To get back to the story. OK? -Quite a record, a young man. -Oh seriously? Profilina rights. And the result at the reception. Yes, at least I wrote the name correctly. -Crime ... What a crime! -What? The crime is that there is above average 5.00. Obviously you need a bigger challenge. -Challenge? -Yes. -Someone like you smori in a place like this. -There you are right, boy. -Excellent. So I thought of something further for you. -What further? How would you like to show what you know on TV? Where? To "high in America? Very funny. No, no, it is a local TV competition called "Cup of Knowledge". TV competition? In fact, it's a competition between students from rival schools. Strong shocks, one on one, Man to Man. That's it.

Now! -This is the nepoverovati. -Thanks directors less. -This you call a score in the entrance? -They told me I was unique in history. Well, not joking. It seems to me ... It seems to me that unless you should have average of at least 3.50, are in great problem. I hope to average 5.00, sir. Hey, stop acting smart, I know you think you're one in a million. I actually statistically one in 3.75 million. Hurts me what you think you are, prikane. You will not scare me, and now is lost before I call security. "But, sir! -Hey, hey, move away from me! If we pretend the problems, immediately call police. And now back to class! So, we took the schedules and went his way. Shut up, baby! -Welcome to Advanced Latin. Advanced-what? -It is an honor to have you in class. -Yeah, what's the deal? Where is Rijkaard? You know Rijkaard? He was a brilliant poet. -Is that it? I am Miss Simpson. Joan.
