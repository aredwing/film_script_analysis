The only thing I'm eating today, is this. -We shoud never have come here. -Nonsense. The people we're renting from sounded nice. You could hear that over the phone? -We're aren't stayng in their house. -Thank God! Look. Beautiful, isn't it? -It'll be exotic. -Shut up! HAPPY, HAPPY They're here! Eirik, come say hi. -Come on! -0ur new neighbors? Hi! Welcome. Hi, I'm Kaja. My God, you are pretty! And you're tall! -Hi. -Sigve. And what's your name? His name is Noa. He doesn't like talking to anyone. Noa. What a fantastic name! Is that African? No, we just liked it. This is your house. And our house is right over there. So we're pretty close. And here is the second children's room. In case you decide to have more kids. Let me show you upstairs. I'm so happy you are here! Have you read this? Have you read that one? Recognize this? You know you're from Africa? If this were the old days, you would have been my slave. Wanna play slave? I can do anything I want to you, even kill you! I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna kill you! We figured you were hungry after all that liftng. -Do you like moose? -0h, yes. .Maybe Danes don't eat moose? -Sure we do. More meat. .So you shot this moose yourself? -Yes. Do you hunt? No, we sing in a choir. We were both in a choir, but had to quit when we moved out here. I can't believe that you sing! We have a choir here that you could join. Yeah... Singing in a choir has always been my dream. But Eirik says I sing like a crow, don't you? So what do you do? Tell me everything. Who is Elisabeth? I'm a lawyer. No, you are not! Isn't that hard? -No, not really. -I would never dare do that. -What do you do? -I teach junior high. German, and arts and crafts. -German? -Yes. -Sprechen Sie Deutsch? -Ja. Sehr gut. Look over here. We can wave to each other. Isn't that nice? If you need anything, or want me to come over, just wave. Or else... Fash this ight. Then you won't have to call. Where are the others? I think they went to see Eirik's lawo. -Lawo? -Yes. He's built a lawo in our yard. Look. -What does he use it for? .Good question. -We thought we'd play a game tonight. -Sure. -Flamenco. -Flamenco! -Seville. -Yes! -0h, Seville... -Yeah. -OK your turn. -I'm up. All right, concentrate now. Are you ready? Ready? 0ne, two, three. That wasn't easy. Two people... I don't get it. Maybe... That's it. Time's up! I couldn't guess it. That's too bad. AIDS! AIDS? .Did none of you get it? -No. Two gay guys in New York, where it was discovered. Then it spread from there to Africa and the rest of the world. Is that Africa? How were we supposed to know they were gay? You try drawing! Elisabeth simply doesn't understand that this can be a little senstive. There! Because it's love we're talking about, right? That's more like it. Didn't you think Elisabeth was gorgeous? .Are you watching wrestling again? -Yeah. I'll go get ready for bed. I'll just grab this. Should we give her ''the look''? You aren't funny. Please stop. Please you're not funny! Please stop! Stop it! I don't like this game! Yes! -Hi. Revenge next weekend? -0K. -Let Eirik know. -OK. Bye. -You could have asked me first. -It will be entertaining. -Kaja is desperate to be my friend. -Because you're so perfect. Shut up! This was your project. And now we have to join some lame church choir. Excellent! Let's contnue with ''prille prolle''. And keep that same intensity until the end. Three, four... Remember the consonants! -Hi. -Welcome to the choir. Thank you. And thank you for letting us join. -Remember to thank Eirik for this. -I will. You can come back any time. -What are you writing? -Christmas cards. They're lovely. We take a picture like that every year. I just love wrting them. Notthat I have many people to send them to. But sometimes we exchange cards at work. They sure must be happy to get these. I can't wait for Christmas! How about you? -I guess I'm pretty childish. -Don't you have some... Some weed? -I'm just kidding. -Right. Bye. Where did you go? Are you masturbating? -Kaja! -I'm coming. She'll probably take another 15 minutes. I know. Don't look at me. Sigve baked it. Really? Wow! I'm impressed. What should we play tonight? I had so much fun last time. -We don't really play games. -But I have been to the store. .Really? -Yes. Just a second. -A surprise! -You could say that. -Thank you. -Take a look at this. -No. -Yes! -No! -Yes... Give it here. ''The Coupes Game. How well do you know your partner?'' Exciting! ''What did you want to be when you grew up?'' An Indian. Voila! An Indian. -That isn't a job. -Eirik, please. -It isn't! -It's what I wanted to be. Don't be such a sore loser. -OK. -0ur move. Kaja? ''What color underwear is your partner wearing?'' What kind of a question is that? -I have no idea. -But I got dressed in front of you! I don't know. Something black and lacy? It's purple. Our turn: ''Would you leave your partner over a casual affair?'' No. No. All right. Kaja, your turn. Yes! ''What did you first love about your partner?' -Hm? -What did you first love about me? I won't be able to guess it anyway. I thought he was going to break up, but he proposed instead. Was that a bad thing? No. It was the happiest day of my Iife. -What's wrong? -Nothing. I'll never be a good singer! Do you want to sing so bad? I want us to sing together, but we never will! -Kaja... -We never do anything together! We don't even have sex. -That's perfectly normal. -It's been over a year! That's because you have that yeast infection. Hi. Are you all right? Sure. I'm just a little drunk. Don't worry. I came for Noa's pajamas. If I can find them. Things are still a mess. You know... I don't have a yeast infection. I did. But I treated it. With a suppository and lotion. It was gone in a week. So... -I don't have it I promise. -It's peffecty normal. Imagine that you have adopted a child! Dark chocolate. He's lovely. Look. Oops. Thank you. I don't know what came over me. It's just that you and Elisabeth are so... Perfect. Elisabeth cheated on me. That's why we moved out here. Thank you for this evening. It was lovely. -Yes, yes. -See you later. .0K. Bye. -Take care. I'm going to bed. How about you? -Good night. -Good night. Hey. I want another baby. Wouldn't that be nice? A little baby? I think I'm ovulating now. Would you like a bowjob? Imagine if we got a little girl. -This family could use a little girl. -Is that all you can think about? You keep whining. ''Wanna have sex? I think I'm ovulating '' If I give you a finger, you take my whole hand. But you never want to have sex. No. I don't understand. Kaja... Look at yourself. You're drunk. And you don't care what you wear. You don't take care of your body. All you do is beg. Is it really surprising that I'm not that interested? Hi! Want to come hunting? I'll be gone for about a week. If the heat pump acts up, just adjust that valve. -Otherwise Kaja can help you. -No problem. Apologize and wn back The love you lost in drunkenness. You are beautiful, quench my thirst Wth rosy lips, love or a Pilsner. I wake up one morning in April On a normal day Are you playing with fire, oh no no Having a cigarette for breakfast You are too good for me But I still want you I don't fit ln They way that I should But I want to know how -Hi. -Hi there! I just thought I'd return this. Thank you. I didn't realize I had forgotten it. -Here you go. -Thank you. I overfilled it. Anyway... About what happened... I know. I'm so embarrassed! I didn't think at all. Typical me. I really need to stop drinking. I apologize. No, there's nothing to apologize for. I had a very...positive experience. .Really? -Yes. I must say, you're very good...at... -Blowing. -No! No way. I happen to know I'm not, so... Elisabeth is probably much better at... I could do it again. If you want. Why not? Take it easy. We have a new choir member today. Kaja, for those who don't know her. Nice to have you here. Let's hear it for Kaja! Kaja, could you come here? I need you to sing so I can determine which voice type you have. Sing ''All the Birds'. Three, four. Excellent Let's try it a little higher. Three, four. Fine. Let's go even higher. Thank you! -''Thank you''? -Yes! I'm serious. I am. And I'm not ashamed to say it. I just feel so... So good. So completely .. ...and utterly good. Do you understand what I mean? Do you? Yes. I do. I feel like I can do anything. I don't want you to see my stomach! -When did you two meet? -In high school. But you're not from around here. I've lived many places. But I went to high school here. With Eirik. -0riginally I'm from Sogne. -From Sogne? -Do you visit your family there? -No. I have no family. Fortunately! Mom didn't want me, so I grew up in different foster homes. But now I have Eirik. And Theodor. They mean more to me than anything. Don't you agree? That family is the most important thing in the world? Mhm. Mhm. You're ugly. What did you say? Look, I found your mom! She's good. .Do you want to try? -Huh? -Ow! -There. Now start walking. -Hide! -No. -Hi. -Hi! Hi. Are you here? Yeah. Congratulate me. I shot a bull. Wow. Congratulations. A big bastard. Want to come to the pub and celebrate? I thought I'd go fora run. Maybe I should join you? -If you think you're up for it. -Sure. Absolutely. Just let me get changed. Could you grab that? Sit-ups. Man, that felt good! -I know. -Why did I ever quit? .You haven't worked out for a while? -No. I used to be in great shape. During my military service. I wrestled in the national championships I was serious about it. Me and a buddy from Bardufoss. He was a great guy We used to room together at training camp. -I wonder what became of him? -Did you lose contact? Yeah. I married Kaja. You know, family man and all that. -It is what it is. -Yeah. Tell me about it. We think we don't deserve any better, but we do. Shit! Well... I think maybe you... ...misunderstood a little. I was just kidding! Right. Anyway... .Thanks for the run. -Yes. OK. See you later. Daddy! Out of my way! Go ahead, start crying. Come on, slave! Come on! Don't sit down! -Hey. -Yes? Shoud we reset the clock? Promise no whining afterwards? We'll just reset the clock. I don't want to hear, ''We haven't done it in a year.'' OK. Hi. Hi. Excellent. Let's begin. OK? Our Christmas concert is coming up. I thought we'd try some new songs this year. So I brought ''Amazing Grace''. I need a soprano soloist. Any volunteers? .Kaja, that would be perfect for you. -No! -It goes pretty high. -She can do it! Yes? Give it a shot! ''Amazing Grace''. Try. Do you know it? Two, three, four. No, I think it's too high for me. Nonsense, Kaja, you can do it! Take some private lessons with Sigve. Let's all try singing the melody together, OK? Two, three, four, five. Excellent! Wait. .Know when like you the most? -No. When you are totally honest. Remember when we were on our way to Thailand? .Remember that flight? -0f course. You thought you were going to de. That was so sweet. When you sat there and held my hand. Remember what you said to me? No. It was so lovely. It was so sweet. Kaja? Is it really possible to sink that low? -What are you talking about? -Stop it! I saw you. And don't tell me you haven't had sex. Was it good? Did you do it in our house? If this is some sort of revenge for Jan, that's just pathetic. ''Oh Elisabeth, move to the country wth me.'' To this miserable dump! My affair is over! It's about time you start forgiving me. .Since that first dinner at our place. -What? It's been going on since that first dinner at our place. When Kaja started crying? Did you want to comfort her, or what? That is typical you, Sigve. - That is typical you '' -Shut up. Do you have any idea how tired I am of that tone of yours? What are you saying? Are you head over heels with Kaja? Yes, as a matter of fact I am. What are you laughing about? What's so funny about that? I'm sorry. 0K. You're in love with her? Why? Because she adores me. You've made it clear you find me pathetic. And she's never had better sex. That's encouraging for me to hear. I know you find it ridiculous, but don't care. There is something called tenderness. Joy. I can't expect you to understand. If only you knew how good it feels to relate to a warm person. -Hi. -Hi. I'm going for a run. Thought maybe... I'm not sure if that... Hi there. Sigve is in love. With Kaja. They're sleeping with each other. And she has never had better sex. -Get out of the car. -Eirik... Get out of the car! Eirik... Is this too primitve for you? We have a different cuture up here. Are you OK? I'm sorry. Sigve, are you OK? I'm so sorry. Let me see. Hey! Shit! Where... Where fahrst du? Heraus! Ich kann nicht hier bleiben ein augenblick mehr. Wirklich! Verdammt, Kaja, du macht mir krank! Sigve? Du wusste sehr gut, das ich habe Sigve gut geliked. Was? Wait! I'm talking to you! Move. Move. Bist du Homo? I know that you don't go hunting. I do your laundry. Bist du?! Nein. This is nicht about mir. This is about dir. Don't leave! Daddy! Lie down there. Ow! I'll go sleep in the lawo. Honey... But... Noa? Come here. Let me look at you. Are you OK? You guys! Hi. There. Here you go. Cheers! Your father is an idiot. Noa? Noa? Are you asleep? What is it? -Do you want to sleep in my bed? -No. OK. Move over. Is Theodor going to call him daddy? Will Theodor call him daddy? No, don't you worry about that. Now go to sleep. There. -It's best you stay here. Tonight. -You're probably right. -Yes. -OK. Good night. Sleep tight. All right. Sleep tight. Hello? Hi. Eirik? Eirik? Eirik, could we try another position? Maybe I could stand? 0r from behind? No, I want to look nto your eyes. I feel much closer if I can look you in the eyes. -I'll take care of you. -That won't be necessary, Eirik. Eirik, stop. Stop. Stop for Christ...! Hi Jan. It's Elisabeth. Yes, it's been a long time. How are you? Hello, can everybody calm down? Hi. Sorry I'm late. It's Christmas Eve, everyone. We are all excited. Let's warm up with ''prille prolle''. Everybody now. And down. .Where do you think you're going? -Home. Go back and sit with Noa. It won't be long now. Is daddy coming? I don't know, honey. Kaja, have you rehearsed your solo? -Yes. -Because we can skip it. No, I really want to do it. Fine. OK. One more time. Ow! Ow! -Go ahead. Start crying. -Dlnner's ready! Keep your mouth shut. That tasted delicious! -Elisabeth, would you like some more? -No thanks. You're so discpined. I'm not. -Here's to the chef. -Cheers! Shoudn't you slow down a little? That dress is lovely Elisabeth. Is it new? -Did you buy it at the mall? -I bought it in Paris. No, you didn't! Seriously? -Sigve was with me. -Really? -How ironic. -Ironic? Yes. I've always dreamt of going to Paris. Look at the boys. I love celebrating Christmas with kids. I do! I could fill the whole house with them. But that's me! ''Hi, I'm Kaja. I want to have kids. Impregnate me.'' You should talk to Sigve about that. He always wanted lots of kids, but I was unable. Are you all right? What just happened in there? Come on. Get up. At least Noa appreciated it. -Are you crying? -No. Elisabeth. I can't live like this anymore. I'miss you! I just wanted to tell you that I've put on coffee. Why can I never learn? Why do have to eat so much? Want some water? -Here. -Thank you. I don't think I'll ever like rice pudding again. -And on Christmas Eve! -Hey, Kaja. . I knew it. I asked him, but he sad no. ''it's you,'' he said. But it isn't my fault. It isn't my fault! Why am I so damn stupid? Stand there in church and... I'm so goddamn stupid! All I really want is for him to love me. I've never meant anything to you, have I? In a sense I think you have meant everything to me. But you love Elisabeth, don't you? Aw, that's kind of nice. Shit... -There you go. -Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Shoud we open some packages? Let's! Let's see... Maybe we should start with this one? Look, mom! I can do it! That was a big success. Is that Sigve's scarf you're wearing? Why in the world did you choose me? I had to. You we'e so in love with me. You seemed thankful to be dating me. I don't know, Kaja. Maybe I thought I could help you. You could help me? You were so miserabe from before. I figured it couldn't get any worse. You have lied to me all along. I know that everything is my fault. But I can fix it, Kaja. I will fix it. I think you'll have to figure this out on your own. I'm not leaving you. No. Maybe not. But I'm leavng you. -Dad, I can fly it! See? -Yeah, I see. -Are you ready? -Yes. -0K. Bye. -Bye.
