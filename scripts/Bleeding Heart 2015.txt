To find me. "Ahimsa," Which means non-Violence, Is the foundation of our practice. We have the ability, Every day, To choose peace. Within every posture, Every breath, And every moment of our lives. That is a nice car. What is that? '65? '66? '65. They don't make 'em like that anymore.

Do you want me to go in with you? Okay. Or you could just borrow something, Because I have plenty of stuff there, like I said. No, I'm... I'm good. - What is that look? - - What look? That look you just gave me. I didn't give you a look. Yes, you did. I to... Okay, you look gorgeous in that dress, I'm just like... I couldn't pull it off the way you do.

It's Cody's dad's gun from Vietnam. Is it loaded? Always. Here. I mean, come on, doesn't that make you a little scared? You have a loaded gun in your house. No. It makes us safe, right? Like if the bad guys come? Yeah, but if the bad guys come, It's more likely to be used on you. No, those bad guys never met Cody. What was our mother like? She was just so much fun. Was she cool? Was she wild? You know, she had such a big heart. She was... I loved her. You would have loved each other. Fuck, nice place. Thanks. Hey, can I ask you something? Yeah, sure. And it's... If it's none of my business, I mean... you don't have to answer. Okay. What kind of massage do you do? Is this what you've been thinking about for the past half hour? No. I was just kind of curious, if... Are you trying to ask me if I'm a hooker? - No. - I prefer sex worker. Sure, yeah. Not that it really matters. No, I get it. I get it. Do you have anything else you want to ask me? - Nope. - Okay. Well, actually, um, Are you okay with what you're doing? I mean, it's not perfect, but, What the fuck is? I don't need to be saved. Mom? - Mom? - - I'm in my room. Okay, um... why don't you just hang out by the pool, Or get a drink, or something? - Okay. - Make yourself at home. Hey, mom, Hey, honey. Whew, it's really chilly in here. Oh, it's so hot outside I can't stand it. This much A.C. Is gonna kill you. I didn't expect to see you this weekend. Well, I hope you don't mind, But I brought a friend. What do you think of this? It's nice. I'm going to re-Decorate. Why? I like it the way that it is. Oh, I like a change. Did you say you brought a friend? Yeah. - Her name is Shiva... - That's unusual. Yeah, and... well actually she's not just a friend. She's my biological sister. Half-Sister. I only just met her. So, it's new for me too. But she's really great. I think you'll like her. I didn't know you were... Why didn't you tell me about this? I don't know. Have you contacted your birth mother? She passed away. And I know that you didn't want me to do that, But since dad died, I don't know... I just... I just don't understand why you didn't talk to me about this. Why so secret? Just because I love you, And I didn't want to hurt you. So why did you bring her here then? I just wanted you to meet her. And she has, I don't know... Trouble with a boyfriend, I thought... I thought it would be nice To have a night away. Life is difficult enough without inviting problems into it, You know that. She's not a problem, mom. I just feel bad for her. You know, she doesn't have any family or anything, She doesn't have anybody. This is pretty, don't you think? Hey. Cody called. Did you speak to him? He left a message. And? Where the fuck are you? I swear to god, I just got out of jail, Shiva, If you're not home by the time I get back, You're fucking dead. You understand? What do you want to do? Oh my god, isn't it too hot? Mom, this is Shiva. Shiva, this is my mom, Martha. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Wow, where are you going? Oh, back to I.A., On a date. - No way... - Blind date. Lynn set it up. I'm too old to be dating, but... Ah, you're never too old to date. Anyway, I hope you girls enjoy yourselves, Don't forget to leave the alarm on when you leave. Okay. Bye, mom. I know we'll be meeting again. I hope so. This is Dex, I gotta take it. Sorry, mom. - See you. Bye. - - Bye. - Hello? - - Hey, you. I was looking at the business account, Looks like there's a thousand dollars missing. - Did you know that? - I know. What, did you pay a bill? Where did it go? I don't understand. It's that gas guzzler, again, isn't it? We've got to get rid of it. That's it. We've got to sell it this week. No more discussion, please. It wasn't the car. Okay? I gave it to Shiva. Wait, what? I gave it to Shiva for her rent. Are you being serious right now? No, I thought it was a good idea. It felt like the right thing to do. Are you out of your mind? I cannot believe that you did not call me, may. We're supposed to talk to each other And to make decisions like this. We're a team. This is unbelie... We need that money, For the first month of rent, If we don't get enough students then we're gonna be... Is this funny to you? No, I just... The line's breaking up, I can't hear you anymore. - May? - Hello? - May? - Hello? Oh, he's pissed. And I haven't even told him I'm out of town. You're a beautiful, powerful woman. Some old bitch told me that once. - Hey - You wanna tell me what's going on? No, I don't know what happened back there, It just cut out. So listen, I am at my mom's place at Santa Barbara with Shiva, And I will be home in time for class tomorrow. What? Yeah, and we did drive the marlin, And we used an entire tank of gas, And it was really fun. I love that car And I don't want to sell it. Okay? I love you so much, Dex. Bye. "May is passionate about sharing this practice "Which so profoundly changed her life." "It gives her great joy to see how peace unfolds in the lives of her students." It just sounds like bullshit. I mean, honestly, most the people that teach this Wanna have a nice ass. Nothin' wrong with having a nice ass. You wanna see my page? You have a webpage? An ad. Here, give me. "Angel will give you the sexiest massage" "With the happiest ending you could dream of," "And nothing gives her more pleasure." As if. It's all fucking bullshit. Don't take it so seriously. But it's different, I mean yoga is about truth. Isn't sex? What was it like the first time You... did it, Like... Well how else do you say it? That I did it. Mmm. Cody and I were at this party, And this guy came up to me, And he was like, "I'll give you 500 bucks if you come home with me." And of course I thought he was kidding. And then I realized he wasn't. And then, I thought Cody would fucking freak, But he didn't. We needed the money. You gotta let your hair down every once in a while. Like a fucking pro. Don't tell anybody. Oh, fuck, oh I love this song. Mmm. - I'm not coming up. - Come on. Yeah, she gave me the money just like that. Easiest money I ever made. Yeah, I can get more, stop bitching at me. She's rich, okay? I'll be home this afternoon. Um, okay. Yeah, I love you. Bye. Hey. We should probably get goin', huh? Okay, yeah. Sure. I'm not trying to steal your money. I just said that because I don't want Him to kill me when I get home. If you don't want to go back, don't. Yeah? You can stay with me and Dex for a few nights. Take this moment to feel the calm in your body. To feel the peace in every cell of your being. Rolling over onto your side, Come up into a comfortable, seated position. Put your hands on your heart. Gently opening your eyes, Bringing that sense of peace and oneness To everything that you see today. Namaste. Namaste. Okay, you guys, thank you so much. See you next week, we're open. Very exciting. Bye, see you tomorrow. Hey. Hey. So, what can I do for you? Uh, Shiva left this at our place. Wouldn't happen to have seen her would you? Well, that's ironic, right? "Shiva". You know, I was uh, I was born in new Mexico. The home of the nuclear bomb. Oh yeah? Yeah, yeah. You know what the guy said who invented it, When we saw the first one explode, You know what he said? He said, "I am Shiva, Destroyer of worlds." You see, that's the thing about Shiva, You know, you get too close to her, And everything you ever loved can be destroyed, Just like the bomb. That's funny, speak of the devil, right? What are you doing here? Well, you know, it's funny, 'Cause I could ask the same fucking thing to you. What are you doing? I'm hanging out, I was just, um... Gonna... I was gonna come home soon. - Oh, really? - - Mmm-Hmm. Wow. You know, that was so nice of you to call and let me know. I mean, you girls been having a nice time While I was in jail? Huh? Shiva's gonna stay here for a few nights. Oh yeah? Yeah. I'm gonna get my stuff. Anyway, like I was saying, You never really know what you're gonna get. And it's not like I imagine you two girls Having much in common, anyway, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Excuse me. Please don't leave with him. You don't want to deal with this, trust me. I don't care. I will call the police. What are they gonna do? They will make him leave. Like he wouldn't come back. I gotta go. Please. Look, remember how you said that it was fate that we met? That's what it's like with me and Cody, So there's no use in fighting it. This is exactly what he wants you to think, But you have a choice. Pressure, that's it, man. I understand this guy, right? - Uh... Dex. - Dex. Dex is amazing, he was just telling me How yoga might help me with my headaches. You know, apparently, I have too much stress in my life. I mean, I don't even know how I get up in the morning. - Let's go. - All right, but you see, The trouble is, it's my girlfriend here, She's always in a rush, makes me crazy. Hey, man, I know exactly what you mean. Uh, if you're interested seriously, take that. Baby, he doesn't want that. Oh, Pico and Lincoln, yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's right above the print shop. Okay, I'll look for it. - Thank you. - Cody. - Good to meet you. - Yeah, Dex. All right. Take care. See you guys. Why were you so nice to him? He's your sister's boyfriend. He is her pimp. Shiva's a whore? Don't call her that. What do you want me to call her? Prostitute? A sex worker. - It doesn't make a difference. - Yeah, it does. Fine, she's a sex worker. And you gave her our money. You know, Dex, I just wanted to help her. She probably set you up from the beginning So she could get our money. Did you even think about that, may? Well, if she did, she is welcome to it. She needs it a lot more than we do. You're telling me that this woman is a prost... A sex worker, and it's okay If she comes into our home? Why does it matter to you so much what she does? Because I don't want that energy in my house. And neither should you. What energy? Okay, stop. Let's just stop. Let's just leave this. Let's go. We're gonna be late. Do you have the info? Here. That's awesome. We'll definitely be there. - See you guys tomorrow. Bye. - Yeah, see you. Bye. What is that? It's the money that I gave Shiva, And the key to our place that she didn't take. Good. This is literally karma in action. - I have to get this to her right now. - Wh... May, just... Let's take a while and think about what you're doing. I don't want to take a moment to think about anything. - We'll be coming tomorrow. - Excellent. - Namaste. Namaste. - Namaste. Okay, bye. Let's not talk about this here right now. This is not appropriate. You know what? Fuck appropriate. Shh. Let's just talk about this outside. What is it with you and this... You know what, this is what you're interested in? This is all you fucking care about? Then you can fucking take it! May. May, stop right there! Fuck you. Don't you ever touch me like that. What is happening to you? You're in there, and you're talking about how you want to heal people? But you only want to heal people who have money. I know one person, right now, who needs help. Okay, I'm not saying don't help her, I'm just saying think this through. She didn't take the money, so she can't pay her rent. And she doesn't have our key, so she has no place to go. You don't even know who she really is. I don't think you know who I really am. Where are you going, may? May! Shiva, it's me. It's may. Can you please open the door? I really need to talk to you. I know you're in there, And I'm not leaving until I see you. What do you want? You forgot these. I don't need 'em. Can we talk, please? Can I come in? I don't need anything, okay? I know you don't. So why did you come here? Just take these from me, okay? I don't need 'em. I said I don't need 'em. I'm not coming over. What is that on your neck? It's nothing, okay? Just leave. Come with me. What's the fucking point? He'll kill me. I'm not gonna let that happen. Oh, yeah, and how are you going to stop it? By chanting? He loves me. This is not love. Yeah, well it's the closest thing I've got, so... You have me, now. I love you. I love you. You don't count. Why not? Because you're a girl. Since when do girls not count? You count.
