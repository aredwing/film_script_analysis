The gypsy family that inspired this film was interned in Mechelen, Belgium, before being deported to auschwitz by convoy Z on January 15, 1944. Miss Lundi is based on the Resistance fighter Yvette Lundy who was deported to Ravensbruck and freed in 1945. Of the 2 million gypsies living in Europe before the war, between 250,000 and 500,000 were killed by the Nazis.
