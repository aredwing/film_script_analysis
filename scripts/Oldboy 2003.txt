It's my daughter's birthday today. I got her a birthday present. A little cloud floating in the sky A pleasure boat sailing on the river My name, Oh Dae-su, means... "getting through one day at a time." That's what "Oh Dae-su" means. But, God... why can't I get through today? Let me go! -Shut the fuck up! -Let me go! Let go! Get away from me! He should be locked up. Grab him! I'll make sure he doesn't get drunk and cause trouble again. Have a nice day, Officer. He's usually a nice guy. Let's go. I'll come back and see you soon. Don't bother. Never come back. That's up to me, assholes. Hey! Yeun-hee, it's Daddy. Yeun-hee, it's Daddy. Daddy's got a present for my little Yeun-hee. I'll be home soon with your present, just wait a bit longer.... Let me talk to her. -Good girl. -Give me the phone. Yeun-hee, Joo-hwan wants a word with you. You remember Joo-hwan, don't you? Hold on. Hello, Yeun-hee. It's me, Joo-hwan. So it's your birthday today? Happy birthday! I'll buy you a nice treat tomorrow. Hello? Oh, hello, Ja-hyun. I'm sorry. I know it's very late. Dae-su is on his way home. I'm sorry. Yes? Hold on. Dae-su, it's your wife. Dae-su! Dae-su! Your wife says you should hurry home! Dae-su, let's get going! Stop messing around! OLDBOY Sir, sir. Wait, come here. Come and talk to me. I won't ask you to let me go again. Just tell me why I'm here, please. I have a right to know why. God, I've already been locked in here for two months. Sir, wait, come here. Sir, wait. What is this place? Please, sir, just tell me how long I have to stay here. Sir! Fuck you! Come here, you asshole! Son of a bitch. I saw your face, asshole! You're dead when I get out! I'm sorry! I won't swear at you again. Just tell me how much longer. One month? Two? Three? Don't go! I'm sorry. Just tell me how long, you son of a bitch! I said tell me how long, you asshole! Son of a bitch! You fucking assholes! If they had told me then that it would be 15 years... would it have been easier to endure? Or harder? LAUGH, AND THE WORLD LAUGHS WlTH YOU. WEEP, AND YOU WEEP ALONE. When the music begins, gas is released. When the gas is released, I fall asleep. Later on, I found out... that it was the same Valium gas that Russian soldiers used... on Chechen terrorists. When I wake up, my hair is cut. I don't really like the style. However, they change my clothes... and clean the room. Generous bastards. One! Two! Three! It's too spicy. I don't want spinach. You eat it. I won't eat spinach. Mrs. Kim Ja-hyun's body was found with stab wounds to the neck. This was a cold-blooded murder. As nothing of value was taken... police suspect the motive was personal. The victim's husband, Oh Dae-su... disappeared a year ago and is still at large. Witnesses say Oh Dae-su was a heavy drinker... who fought constantly with his wife. Neighbors also frequently argued with Oh Dae-su. Blood samples found at the scene match those of Oh Dae-su. Oh Dae-su's fingerprints have been matched to those found on a glass. Sources claim that Oh Dae-su definitely visited his wife recently. The only missing item... was a family album, which supports the police theories. After three years... many wrinkles form on a man's face. If you stand outside a phone booth on a rainy day... and meet a man whose face is hidden by a violet umbrella... my advice is... that you make friends with television. The television is both clock and calendar. It is your school, home... church... friend... and lover. But.... But... my lover's song... is too short. Today at 7: 50 am, the middle of Seoul's Songsu Bridge... fifty meters long, suddenly collapsed.... I wrote a list... of all the people I had offended, quarreled with, and hurt. This was both my prison journal... and the autobiography of my evil deeds. I thought I had lived a normal life... but there was too much wrongdoing. All I could think at that moment... was that the man in the next room... probably only had one chopstick. But.... But.... Who had imprisoned me? Was it Yoo Heung-sam? Lee So-young or Kang Chang-suk? Whoever it was, wait. Just you wait. I'll rip your body limb from limb... and your remains will never be found. Because I will swallow every last bit. One line for each year. When I start doing this, I am already six lines behind. So next year will be easier. The more tattoos I have, the shorter the chopstick becomes. The shorter the chopstick becomes... the bigger the hole in the wall becomes. Anyway... time passes well. Nine years. Ten years. Eleven years. EX-PRESlDENT CHUN DOO-HWAN ARRESTED HONG KONG HANDOVER CEREMONY PRlNCESS DlANA'S FUNERAL OFFlClAL APPROVAL OF lMF FUND Twelve years.

I'll be out in just one month. I'll be out. I'll be out in one month's time. I'll be out of here. I'll be out in a month. In exactly one month. I'll need money when I get out, so what should I do? Should I steal or rob? What shall I eat first? Kimchee soup? Barbecued eel? Anything but fried dumplings. But where am I? With all the car horns, it must be the city. The most important thing is what floor I'm on. What if I break through the wall and I'm on the 52nd floor? Even if I plunge to my death, I'll still be getting out. I'm getting out. In one month, I'm getting out. Picture yourself... Iying in a field. When you hear the bell... you will turn your head... and look down. You will see... an endless field of green grass. The sun is shining brightly. There's a cool breeze. It's a human being. Don't stop me! Mister! Even though... I'm no better than a beast... don't I have the right to live? Even though... I'm no better... than a beast... don't I have the right... to live? Yes? Yes. The alley with the phone booth was just here. Now there's an apartment building. So he releases me onto the roof. What a fool. I want to tell you my story. Die later. What? What the hell? I see. Now I'll tell you my story. The reason... I want to die is.... Hey, mister! That's a female human being. Laugh... and the world laughs with you. Weep... and you weep alone. My home is gone. I cannot call my friends or relatives... because they say I murdered my wife. I am a fugitive. You dickshit! Dickshit. A new word. Television doesn't teach you swear words. Can 10 years' worth of imaginary training... be put to use? Apparently, it can. Rock bream. Oplegnathus fasciatus. Lives in the warm waters of coastal reefs. This fish has weak reflexes... but can resist powerfully when caught on a hook. In the Kyongsang Province, its offspring.... What is that smell? Don't bother asking me any questions. I don't know anything. Yes? I said I want to eat something alive. Oh, right. Long time, no see. This is my first time here. Maybe I'm wrong. But she looks familiar. You look very familiar. Have we met before? Search for the Best Chef. Thursdays at 6:30 on MBC. "The youngest female chef of Japanese cuisine." Oh, that? They said the ratings are low, but someone must watch it. Women's hands are usually warm, so they cannot make sushi. Well, you certainly know your stuff. Who are you? Do you... Iike your clothes? Why? Why did you imprison me? Who do you think I am? -Yoo Heung-sam? -Wrong. -Did Lee So-young pay you? -Wrong again. Lee Jong-yong? Kang Chang-suk? Hwang Joo-yeun? Kim Na-sung? Park Jin-woo? Im Duk-yoon? Lee Jae-pyung? Kuk Su-ran? -Who the hell are you? -Me? I'm a sort of scholar. And my field of study is you. A scholar studying Oh Dae-su. An expert on Oh Dae-su. Who I am isn't important. What's important is why. Think hard. Study your whole lifetime. School has finished, now it's time for your homework, isn't it? Keep this in mind: "Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock... "in water they both sink alike. " Let me ask you one thing. You hypnotized me in there, didn't you? What did you do to me? I miss you. Come quickly. Here you are. It's alive, okay? Now can I slice it up for you? I must be a different breed of woman. My hands are very cold. Why is she doing this? Sir. Sir, wake up. Keep this in mind. "Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock... "in water they both sink alike. " Are you awake? Is all this true? That fever remedy works well. Why did you faint if you've done so much physical training? A lack of vital sunlight leaves one depleted of vitamins A and E. Thus, one's immunity to influenza is weakened. Do you always talk like that? The lock on the bathroom door is broken. Don't get any bright ideas... or I'll gut you like a fish. What's this? Suppositories. You fainted, so how else could I give you medicine? Can 15 years' worth of imaginary training be put to use? Apparently not. That was an unforgivable sin. I brought you back here and then turned you down. I can see why you're angry. I really can. You know, I brought you here because I like you. But... you don't even know my name yet. It's Mi-do. You see... Iater on... when I'm really ready... I swear on my life that I'll go through with it. That song in your diary, The Face I Want to See, that will be the sign. When I sing it... get ready. I may try to resist you again... in the heat of the moment. But no matter what, don't stop. Just give it to me! Give it... to me. The ants... do you still see them? Do you still feel that way? Yeah, if you're alone, you see ants. People I have met who are very lonely have all hallucinated about ants. I tried once to work out why. Ants move around in groups, you know. So I suppose very lonely people keep thinking of ants. Although I have never done that. She called from overseas five or six years ago... asking if her dad had come back. She doesn't even know that he killed her mother. She has hardly any relatives, so she calls us. Her Korean has gotten worse. I think her Swedish foster parents are both doctors. You journalists must know. Dae-su... is he really still on the run? Your daughter's address is on the front... and on the back is a map of your wife's grave. EVA VON LJUNGBERG STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN Eva. Stockholm. Eva. Do you want to call her? Shall I call her? Shall we visit the grave tomorrow? No, first I have to kill that bastard. BLUE DRAGON Well? I haven't tasted it yet. BLUE DRAGON So? Did it taste the same? I could taste food from 100 restaurants... but I will never forget the food I tasted for 15 years. BLUE DRAGON Shall I create an lD for you, so you can log in? Do you have a favorite film or song? I've already been talking... to him. The Count of Monte Cristo? There's no one by that name here. How's life in a bigger prison, Oh Dae-su? Who are you? Who are you? The lonely prince in the high tower. Who is he? I don't know who he is. I just chat to him sometimes. We talk about sushi. Where are you going? Where are you going? I can't trust you. VlOL BLUE DRAGON Violet Blue Dragon. What does that mean? Why did they order from a place so far away? I've already passed five Chinese restaurants. I think my lungs are on the verge of exploding. You there, tell your cooks... to put less scallions in the dumplings. Okay. -Leave it there and go. -Yes, sir. We don't take on anyone who uses bodyguards. Some companies specialize in that. You should go to them. We just take the small fry. If the stay is over six months, transportation is free. Yes, of course. Why did you imprison me, you... dickshit. In our business on floor 7.5... client confidentiality is our livelihood. I am going to avenge myself for all 15 years. Each tooth I extract will age you by one year. Keep still. Do you want to talk? I don't know. I didn't see his face. I made recordings. OH DAE-SU All those who are blood type AB, raise your hand. Go. Shoo! He has lost a lot of blood. Piece of shit. Is he dead? I can't seem to... get through today, either. Now I have become a monster. When my vengeance is over... can I return to being Oh Dae-su? Mister, are you alright? Look at all this blood. What happened to you? Saewoon Apartments, Eung-am, Building 8. Take care of him. Thank you. Not at all. Well, then... farewell, Oh Dae-su. Farewell... Oh Dae-su. Farewell. Farewell. The bastard you hate, but don't dare kill. The bitch you detest, who deserves a fate worse than death. We are at your service. Won't he go crazy if he's locked up for a long time? Well, if you don't want that, we can drug his drinks. There's a thing called "Risperdal solution. " It's a reliable drug used to treat schizophrenia. But it depends on the length of the treatment... so how long will he.... Fifteen years. Is that possible? What did he do? Oh Dae-su, you see... talks too much. Go to sleep. Tomorrow, you will visit Joo-hwan's lnternet cafe. Sit wherever you like. Joo-hwan. Oh Dae-su, you see... talks too much. Have you heard this voice before? Who do you think hates me this much? Those 260 women you've had.... No way to remember the names of their husbands. USER lD: monster[at]nate[dot]com MlDO Who's Mi-do? A little girl who cries a lot. Joo-hwan... did l... really talk too much? My friend... maybe you should... Iook for the criminal among people you're close to. Search: Evergreen Chat to Evergreen? Congratulations. Your case was automatically dismissed yesterday. "But please remember this." Open quote. "Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter... "like a bird from the snare of the fowler... "free yourself." Close quote. Who are you? Who are you? You bastard! I decided when I was a prisoner... that if I got out, I would trust no one. If I met anyone suspicious... I would invent a secret, only known to the two of us. That lD, Monster, is a trap I designed to catch him. You let a stranger into your home. Who the hell are you? Who's Evergreen? I tracked down that Evergreen ID and found the owner's details. -Are you ready to jot it down? -Go ahead. It's Su Dae-oh. Does the surname 'Su' even exist? -Address? -Saewoon Apartments in Eung-am. Building 7, flat 407. Actually, life in a bigger prison... does not suit me very well. Evergreen. Who are you? Is that what you wanted to ask? No. You must find that out for yourself. Come on, it's a game. First who, then why. When you know the answer, come and see me. I'll mark your work. You have until July 5. Oh no, only five days left. Too short? Chin up. If you succeed, I'll kill myself instead of Mi-do. That's right, Mi-do. I'm going to kill... every woman you love until you die. Well, you're notorious... for not protecting your women anyway. Wow, you're strong, Mr. Monster. Yes, you are the monster that I created. But you will never... find out why if you go through with this. You have been curious for 15 years. Are you still going to kill me? Sit down there. Ah, the tooth torture! You won't have enough time. I have a pacemaker for my weak heart. When it was put in... do you know what I said to the doctor? "Dr. Hopkins... "give me... "a remote control to turn my motor off." "Pardon? Why?" "So that I can kill myself easily. At any time. "I'll pay you an extra $100,000 for this." What a dilemma. You want to kill me right now... but then you won't know why you were imprisoned. You want to torture me, but I say I'll kill myself first. Revenge? Or the truth? What a problem for you. I've been watching over you for 15 years. I've fared well, thanks to you. I wasn't bored or lonely. Seeking revenge is the best cure for someone who has been hurt. Try it. The loss of 15 years... the pain of losing your wife and child... all this can be forgotten. Once again, revenge is good for your health. But... what happens after you've had your revenge? I bet that hidden pain probably emerges again. Are you there, Oh Dae-su? Oh Dae-su. Long time no see. Hasn't she been tied up too long? You left her door open. Save me, Dae-su! I can't. I'm going to die. This dentist is very good. Keep still. Keep still. What's his problem? You see... they say that people... shrivel up because of their imagination. So don' t imagine anything. You'll become brave as hell. Now here comes the real thing. Sir, I'm glad you told me about this place... but I haven't even started yet! Let's go. Let's go now. Let's fight. Let's fight. What a tough guy! Your hand. I'll chop off your hand. You touched Mi-do's breasts. Let's get out of this dump. So do you trust me now, you bastard? It looks hard to accomplish. I looked into it. The reason the bank refused to pay 270 million won... was not due to any building irregularities. They have internal problems. So I don't think we'll have any trouble. Chairman Choi's 23 clients' shares are at 25 percent.... Dae-su. Yeah? Did he really say that he'd kill me? Yeah. Because I'm the woman you love? Dae-su. What? Where is my love? I'm getting lonelier in the nights The words you send with your eyes I can feel with my hand So many nights have passed My heart is going to you As I shed my sad tears You're the face I miss They packed up their stuff and left in a rental car. Also, Mi-do called the restaurant and left her job. Let's go after this is done. You should get some rest today, sir. I can't even sleep. Because I'm lonely. Mr. Han. Do you really think... that Mi-do has fallen in love with Oh Dae-su? Already? Dae-su! It hurts so much. But I'll endure it. You shouldn't forget this. How did you hold out for 15 years? There's always a way. Do you like it? You do like it, don't you? I want to make you feel good, Dae-su. You need not worry about the future. Imagine nothing. I am grateful for all those years spent in that prison. If I was the old Oh Dae-su, would Mi-do still have liked me? He could only have known that I said I would chop off Mr. Park's hand... by putting a bug on us. And he knew where we were by tailing us. I've been bugged. Please find it. You know... maybe he freed you... because he has fun watching you run wild, seeking revenge. And he'll never tell you why, so he can toy with you forever. Couldn't that be why?

WELCOME TO EVERGREEN OLD BOYS THE SANGNOK HlGH SCHOOL ALUMNl HOMEPAGE It's time to close now. Can I just look at the records for the class of '79? It's dark. Put the lights on. Take your time. LEE WOO-JlN Joo-hwan? Let me ask you something. Do you remember Lee Woo-jin from school? I think he went to study in America. Lee Woo-jin? I don't know him. So is that the bastard's name? How did you find out? I looked through all the school yearbooks. I need more than just a name. Got anything else? Look at the student records. Do you know Lee Soo-ah? She was in our year. Lee Soo-ah? She died. -What classroom was she in? -Room two, I think. She was my classmate. Next to yours. But what about her? Why is there no photo? She died. That must be why. How did Lee Soo-ah die? Yeah, you wouldn't know. She died after you transferred. She went to the Habchun Dam alone and fell into the water. She drowned. One week later, they found her bloated body in the water. -What was she like? -Her? She was a complete slut. On the outside, she acted like a innocent lady... but inside, she was just a filthy whore. The rumor was going around school that she'd fuck anyone. I should have got in there. I also heard that her family was filthy rich. Her grades were good, too. But the worst thing was that she was a total slut. God, this is such an old story. Dae-su, I can't remember because it was so long ago... but that Soo-ah, well-- Joo-hwan, what is it? Joo-hwan, is something wrong? Oh Dae-su. My sister... was no slut. You must believe that. You got rid of your bug, so I had to come all the way here... to eavesdrop. That's why Joo-hwan is dead... because of you. Okay? You bastard, I'm coming for you! I'm going to kill you! You son of a bitch! We're not open yet. Come back in an hour, please. This place was recommended by someone with six gold teeth. Mr. Park? I had to move because of you. To celebrate the occasion... I installed a new TV. Do you like it? It's got so many channels. Great, isn't it? Some prisoners don't want to leave at all. You lived in a place like this for 15 years, Dae-su? After 11 years it felt like home. Come on, I don't need your money. My enemy's enemy is my friend. We threw away the hand because it rotted. I've missed you. Bastard. You'll pay for this. So why did you bring me here? If I don't return after July 5, let her go. While I was locked up here, I remember someone visiting me. What did that person do? Was it three times? I put a hypnosis-inducing drug in your water. Sodium barbiturate? You're a genius! WATERWHEEL HAlR SALON That's nonsense. Even though it was a Catholic school... those rumors wouldn't have killed her. There was probably something else. Could she have been pregnant, maybe? I really don't think Soo-ah was like that. She was such a pure girl. I know she never went with anyone. But she did go out with someone back then. Do you want to know who he was? I haven't got a clue! Choon-shim. You knew Lee Soo-ah, didn't you? Who was her boyfriend? You don't know? You silly cow. You don't know... because friendship means nothing to you. Shut up. Who would know? Who? Joo-hwan? What? Yeah, I know him. But why would he know? Yeah? Really? Okay. I'll call you back in a bit. Well... she said it was Joo-hwan who told her the rumors... and that you should know more than anyone. Ring, ring. Move aside. You'll get hurt... if you get in the way. OH DAE-SU Good Lord! You rascal. Put it out! I'm leaving today for Seoul. So just you leave me alone, missy. You good-for-nothing! You're Oh Dae-su, aren't you? And you are.... I heard you're popular with the girls. You know what rumors are like. I heard you're really funny. Make me laugh. I don't want to be tied to just one image. Okay, there's this father and son. They went to the swimming pool and.... See you later. TAKE CARE, FUCKHEADS OF YEAR 3, CLASS 3! -Come on. -Wait. -Come here. -No. Come here. Okay, okay. Satisfied? -Lift this up. -No way. -Lift it up. -No. What? That tickles. Give me those. What are you doing? Let me see. What are you doing? -Let me see. -Stop it. Go away. Was it really Soo-ah? Are you sure? I don't know her name. I just know that she's in your class and she rides a red bike. Have a good trip. See you in Seoul. Where are you going? I've got a date with Choon-shim. I'll kill you if you blab to anyone. No way. You got locked up for 15 years just for saying that? Is that such a crime? "Whether it be a grain of sand or a rock... "in water they both sink alike. " That's Lee Woo-jin's attitude. So... what's the significance of July 5? That's the day... Lee Soo-ah died. It's over now. You were fighting for the truth... not for revenge, weren't you? Now we'll run away where Woo-jin can never follow us. I can't end it like this. Vengeance has become a part of me. But you don't even know where he lives. "Like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter... "like a bird from the snare of the fowler... "free yourself. " It is taken from the Book of Proverbs, chapter six, verse four. And Evergreen... said he lives in a high tower. So six and four... must be floors. Fourth floor. Sixth floor. Or the 64th floor? P? Penthouse! Please insert the code. What would you like me to pray for? Wrong entry. Please re-enter. Wrong entry. Please re-enter. "Dear Lord... "please let me... "meet a younger man next time." Please make Woo-jin... kneel before Dae-su... and beg for forgiveness. You slept with your sister. Let's go upstairs and talk. Get him! You could just talk. That was refreshing. You slept with your sister. So refreshing. And I started the rumors. That's why your sister died. Looking in the mirror reminds me of that day. How about you? Erasing my memory and telling me to find the truth was cowardly. I won... so die like you promised. Did you think you had forgotten that day because you were hypnotized? Really? Do you know the real reason why you can't remember? It's because... you just forgot. Is that not exciting enough for you? Well it's true, you just forgot. Why? Because it wasn't important to you. Your rumor got so out of hand... that the next rumor was that Soo-ah was pregnant. My sister got sucked into that rumor... and began believing it. So her periods stopped and her belly began to swell. Fascinating, isn't it? Imagine how it would feel for a girl to carry a child who's her own nephew. Do you understand now? Your tongue got my sister pregnant. It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick. It was Oh Dae-su's tongue. Is that why you killed your sister? Imagine how a boy would feel... fathering both his child and his nephew? You were probably afraid. Afraid that everyone would know once the baby was born. After you killed her, you realized it was a phantom pregnancy... so your hating me... is understandable. They said Soo-ah died alone at the dam... so who took this photo? And what about the date, July 5? This is no fun. I'll just finish what I was saying. Listen carefully. My story is really exciting. Ever heard of post-hypnotic suggestion? You suggest something during hypnosis... then it's performed in your wakened state. Still haven't worked it out? You let a stranger into your home. Who the hell are you? What about you, you bastard? We hypnotized both of you. One fortunate thing was that, compared to others... both of you were highly receptive to hypnosis. Isn't this fun? One word gets you pregnant. Another makes you fall in love. But no matter how receptive you two were to hypnosis... and no matter how good a hypnotist Miss Yoo is... getting people to fall in love isn't easy. Do you know how we did it? Your first suggestion, of course... was to go to that restaurant... straight after your release. Next, to react to the mobile phone's ringtone. When you heard this, you were programmed to say something. Who are you? Do you... Iike your clothes? And Mi-do was programmed to react to the man... who would say this. When she touched your hand, your reaction would be, of course.... Your gravest mistake wasn't failing to find the answer. If you keep... asking the wrong questions, you'll never find the right answer. It's not "Why did Woo-jin imprison me?" It's "Why did he release me?" Once again: Why did Woo-jin release Dae-su... after 15 years? Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone. Mr. Han. Mr. Han! Mi-do. Mi-do doesn't know, does she? Why did you hide her there? Did you think he'd hate me just because I cut off his hand? Didn't you work out that it was a trap? How can you protect your woman with that brain? I've secretly been raising Mi-do since she was three. What's wrong with you? Mr. Park's hand? You moron. Did you see his new prison? I gave him that building for his hand! Me! Dae-su! In front of me... there's some kind of box. He's telling me to open it. It's the same violet box.... No! No, Mi-do, don't. Don't open it, no matter what. Or something terrible will happen. What's in it? You know, don't you? Mi-do, just wait a little longer. Dae-su will be there soon. I'll be there very soon. Can't you come now? I'm scared. Little Mi-do, you can wait, can't you? Yes. Very good. Good girl. I'll call you back very soon, okay? Please. Don't tell Mi-do. What has she done wrong? You know it was all my fault. I have... committed an unforgivable sin... against your sister. And I also... did you wrong. But... please leave Mi-do alone. If by any chance... Mi-do finds out the truth... you son of a bitch! I'll tear you... Iimb from limb. And your remains will never be found. Why? Because I'm going to swallow every last bit. Woo-jin! Please, sir, I made a mistake. Please forget what I said. Sir! Woo-jin! We're Evergreen Old Boys, remember? With the energy Of a green pine tree The Great Sangnok High.... I'll do whatever you want. I'll do anything. I beg you. Woo-jin, if you want me to be your dog, I will! From this moment on I am Woo-jin's dog! I'm your bitch. Look, I'm wagging my tail. I'm a dog. I'll guard your house. I'll be your slave. The box... just leave it closed. Now... what will I live for? Dae-su! It hurts so much. But I'll endure it. You must understand. My sister and I loved each other despite everything. Can you two do the same? I want to make you feel good, Dae-su. Soo-ah. Woo-jin. I know you've always been afraid. So just let go of me. Please remember me. I have no regrets. Do you? This is the whole adventure of my life until now. Thank you for listening to this terrible story to the end. I trust that you will understand my sending a letter... instead of talking to you in person. This is because I have no tongue. To be honest, there's no reason I should help you. But there was one thing. I was touched by this last sentence. Even though I'm no better than a beast... don't I have the right to live? The hypnosis may go wrong and distort your memories. Do you want to proceed? If you're ready... Iook at that tree. The tree... is slowly changing into a concrete pillar. You're now inside Lee Woo-jin's penthouse. It's a dreary night. The sound of your footsteps crossing to the window... fills the room. When I ring my bell... you'll split into two people. One person doesn't know your secret: Oh Dae-su. The one who knows your secret is the monster. When I ring the bell again... the monster will turn around and start walking. With each step, he will age by one year. When he reaches 70, the monster will die. There's no need to worry. It will be a very peaceful death. Now, good luck to you. What's going on? Look at you. Who were you with? I love you... Dae-su.
