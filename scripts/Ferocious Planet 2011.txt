What an unexpected surprise. I thought you'd retired. I see you, uh, dressed up specially for the occasion. Hey, is this the IRS building? Next door. [Laughs] Rent-a-cop, huh? Perfect job for a man who disgraced his country. Come along! This is quite a crowd. You nervous or something? I get nervous driving to work. This makes me terrified. Keep it together. My neck is on the line. Decades of work on the greatest discovery ever, and that jerk senator wants to kill my funding. And stop that tapping! Yeah, sure. He's the jerk. What's our power reading? It's 100%. [Indistinct chatter] He's here. I haven't seen you for some time. Stay focused. And no mistakes. If we convince the President's people, this project stays alive. You almost ready? Just about. I, uh-- I really enjoyed myself last night. It would've been better-- Not now. Not ever. Right there. Everything's secure. I bet you'll be glad when you're sitting on your boat, instead of having to baby-sit these eggheads and politicians. Bad missions are like relationships, Lieutenant. They all start great, but end miserably. Thank you for joining me today for what could be the most significant scientific experiment ever. Today we make history for two achievements. The first promises clean, unlimited, renewable energy. The world's first cold fusion generator. [Hushed] Cold fusion again? I thought that was a dead fish. The second is the culmination of over 30 years of research, which started with my father, Dr. Taidgh O'Hara, back home in Ireland. After his death, I continued and perfected his research. Ladies and gentlemen, today we will discover what mysteries the universe holds. For the first time in history, we will peer into parallel dimensions. Parallel dimensions? You didn't mention anything about this to me. What you're witnessing now is a dimension that sits directly on top of our own. My father theorized that there are an unlimited number of worlds, each existing in our exact location. And it is for this that you require a further $250 million of taxpayers' money? How do we know this is even real? This is the scientific documentation that explains the process. It's been verified by the scientific community after extensive peer review. Of course, there are only a dozen people in the world who can actually understand it. MAN: And you're not one of them. And I don't suppose any of them are taxpayers. [Laughs] Uh, Dr. O'Hara-- Karen Fast, Science Advisor for the President. Is it possible to travel to these places? Sadly, we can only see them. But we've chosen these dimensions to show you both the extraordinary differences to Earth, and, as you'll see from the next dimension, the extraordinary similarities. Based on our initial research, this world shares many commonalities with our own. Any signs of intelligent life? None yet. However, the flora and fauna indicates an atmosphere very similar to our own. Our research shows that there are billions upon billions of other dimensions. It is a virtual certainty that intelligent life exists. [Roars] What was that? Ohh, Dr. O'Hara, the power's spiking. Impossible. The Theta's 88. I'm just gonna bring the power output down to 1.21 terawatts. Did he say "terawatts"? It's not responding. We need to evacuate. Immediately. [Groaning] Private? Command to Delta-- come in. Command to Delta. [Squelching] [Gunshots] [Groans] [Gunshots] Alpha to Command. Over. Alpha to Command. Go for Command. Colonel, I heard gunshots. Where are you? Down the hall. We have a security breach. Sweep and secure the room. Nothing in or out. Roger that. [Clatter] [Snarls] [Clatter] [Shrieks] [Thud] You sure? I'm fine. Really? I'm fine, I'm okay. I can't believe it. They're all dead. Another one over here. This is terrible. Just terrible. All secure, Colonel. Colonel! Colonel, where the hell have you been? Just when we need you, you disappear. Now, there are people here who need serious medical-- [All coughing] I just killed this thing... after it chomped off the arm of one of your colleagues. What is it? What's that smell? Ammonia? I think it's coming from the blood. That's remarkable. I'm gonna ask you one more time. What the hell is this? Oh, my God. I think this has come from a parallel dimension. Impossible. That's impossible. Are you saying this critter came through that machine? This is hogwash. I'm getting out of here. Senator, you're gonna stay here until I tell you it's safe to go. Protocol assumes quarantine until I can confirm otherwise. [Rumbling] Earthquake! Earthquake! Everybody hold on! The machine! Doctor! The machine! Doctor! [Grunting] Get in here, boy, quick! Help us! We can't let it get damaged! Guys, it's slipping! I want that machine destroyed! First an explosion kills innocent civilians, then it's the critters! And now it's started an earthquake! What the hell is it gonna do... next? [Rumbling stops] [Siren blaring] What are you doing here, boy? Get out! I grew up in California. That didn't feel like an earthquake. It almost felt like we were sliding. Ah! Ah! Lex! Ah! Ah! Doc, what's happening? I think he's having a heart attack. There's a defibrillator on the wall over there. He's not breathing. I need to start CPR. Lieutenant, Private. Sir? Guard the door. Make sure nothing gets in or out. One, two, three, four. [Charging] Clear. [Thud] I don't like what's going on. Protocol for an emergency like this-- we'd put out an immediate response, like a quarantine. Clear. [Thud] Something is seriously wrong out there. He's not responding. I'm sorry. He's gone. CRENSHAW: All right, enough is enough. BURK: Senator, I think, under the circumstances-- I am out of here. We should be listening to the military. Stay back, sir. Okay, okay. Senator... I'm authorized to use force to stop you. I would dearly like to see the authorization that permits a disgraced colonel to shoot a United States Senator going about his public duty. I don't know what went wrong with you. You were once a golden boy, but you brought disgrace and dishonor to yourself and to our country. Now, I'm gonna get help for these people before you get them all killed. Oh, damn it. Out of my way, sir. [Roaring] What the hell is this place? SYNN: Guess he won't be running for reelection. [Roaring] [Roaring] [Snarling] That doesn't look like the IRS building next door. What the hell is that?! Whatever it is, it's pissed. Everyone get back! [Gunshots] We are definitely gonna need a bigger boat. Boat? Fall back! Oh! Come on! Whoa! I don't think it's gonna hold, Colonel! Got any more weapons? Negative, sir. We were providing light security. Rifles were stored upstairs with Vitale and the rest of the team. Smoke grenades aren't gonna do crap. Ah! Do you think it's gone? [Door creaking] What's going on here, Colonel? I was hoping you could tell me. [Exclaiming] Are you insane?! What the hell are you doing? Come here. Come on, take a look. I don't understand. How can this be? Where's the rest of the building? We were three stories underground. From the looks of it, I'd say that machine of yours moved our little corner of the building somewhere. Impossible. That's impossible. I really wish you'd stop saying that. Do you realize we're the first people ever to travel to another dimension? Won't mean anything if we don't get home. Well, that machine brought us here. Can't it get us back? It was damaged in the blast. I'll have to repair it. But even if I do-- We can do it. Then I suggest you start looking at ways to get us home. Wait a minute, wait a minute. If we're in a parallel dimension, then how come we can still breathe? Well, the dimension we were viewing before the machine... malfunctioned was chosen for its similarities to our own. Looks like we were correct. Well, at least you got one thing right. I'm one of the smartest people on the planet. I'll figure this out. Well, we should take this opportunity to explore. We may never get this chance again. Bad idea. We don't know what's out there. The rules of our dimension might not even apply here. For all we know, there might be 20 more of those things waiting for us out there. All the reason to do some recon. If there are more things out there like this, I need to know. Very heroic, Colonel. But very stupid. It's called self-preservation, Doc. Well, it's your neck. But don't say I didn't warn you. FAST: I'm going with you, Colonel. The President will want a full report, and I'm gonna make sure I give it to him. Fine. You two-- Beavis, Butt-head-- get these bodies into the storage room down the hall. Lieutenant, we take off in five. Copy that. Miraculous. Looks like the building slid down. Our earthquake. All right, we'll head toward those trees and circle around. Stay sharp. I don't think you're gonna get much reception here. I'm using the camera. We'll need documentation to take back with us. No one is going to believe this. Remarkable. If I didn't know better, I'd say this is a giant Amanita muscaria. Better known as mushroom. Did I fail to mention the ground rules? Take your hands off me, Colonel. We stick together. You do not wander off. I've already lost a lot of people today, and I don't intend to lose any more. Understood? Understood. REID: Colonel? How the hell did that happen? Is that one of the meters from in front of the building? Must've got caught in the force of the explosion. Gotten sucked in. Is it safe? I think so. Unless you've illegally parked. Private. Leave it. Don't worry. I won't turn you in. But if we find a bar out here, you've got to buy me a stiff drink. Port 1, nominal. Port 2, nominal. Port 3 at plus-34. [Beeping] Port 3 at plus-36. [Whining] [Whining stops] Port 3, nominal. Looks like the exchange coupler's fried. Can you fix it? It'll take more than a whack on the side. But, yeah, I can. Help me pull it out. [Beeps] I need you to stay focused. I'm sorry. I'm okay. It's just-- Well, you know how I get. How did this happen? This is the only possible explanation. But that's-- Hold on, wait. You forgot... How did I miss that? It still doesn't explain-- Hang on. Yeah. That's it. But it's theoretically impossible. We're living proof that it's far from impossible. We can worry about the theoretical later. I'm more worried about our other problem. Even if we fix this-- I know. Never thought I'd be clearing away bodies. I'm just the auditor for the project. I only came down here to have a look. Thought it would get me out of work early today. Bad call. You could say that. What about you? I've been an aide for the Senator now for about three years. Guess I'd better find a new boss. Just two working stiffs, huh? Not the best choice of words, but... yeah. Although... if we make it back... When we make it back. When we make it back, we're gonna be so famous. Do you think? Hell yeah! We could really cash in. Talk shows, Fox & Friends, the works. This could be our ticket. Of course, uh... if we were the ones to bring this back-- I mean, all I'm saying is, we gotta be on our toes around here. We gotta be ready for when the window of opportunity presents itself. And if we were to work together... Like partners? Like partners. I like that. Now, all we have to do is to get ourselves something, anything, to guarantee our fame and fortune. Something like, uh-- This? Aaaah! Aaaah! [Screaming] Uhh. Oh! Ohh! He's dead. What the hell happened? He poked it with a pen, then that black stuff shot out and hit him in the face. I told him not to. What is it? Acid? Looks like it. Don't poke the alien. So, how does a colonel get stuck guarding a lab? Stuck? It's my dream job. I'm gonna string out as soon as the paperwork goes through. Got someone special waiting for you back home? Yeah. She's all I think about. What's her name? Columbine. Columbine? It's the name of a flower. She was named before the shooting. I was gonna rename her "The Light Brigade", but they say it's bad luck to rename. A boat. So, uh, that Dr. O'Hara is pretty hot. You two have gotten pretty friendly these past couple of weeks. Did you tap that yet? I don't think it'd go over too well with the bosses. We're supposed to be staying out of the scientists' way. Well, she does seem like a cold fish. That won't stop me from trying. [Screaming] God! Go! Go, go, go, go! [Roaring] [Gunshots] [Gunshots] Rivers, stay down! I'll be back for you! Okay, Colonel! [Roaring] [Snarling] Rivers, come in. Go ahead, Colonel. I can't see the entrance. Smoke grenade. Roger. Can you see what it's doing? [Roaring] Negative, sir. You still have your smoke grenades? Roger that. Uh, Colonel... I'm gonna need some assistance. Looks like I landed in some quicksand. Quicksand? Sorry about that, Colonel. All right. I can't see a thing out this door. What's your bearing? I'm about 20 meters your one o'clock. And, Colonel... you'd better hurry. Roger that. All right, Lieutenant... I'm gonna have you deploy your grenades three meters from the building, on my mark. Copy that. This is suicide. You're never gonna make it. Just give it some time. It will leave. What if it doesn't? I'm not gonna leave him out there. He did the same for me once. What, saved your ass in some other parallel dimension? No. Tehran. The Iranian nuke facility. That was you. No wonder the Senator hated you. I put together a briefing report for the President. I just didn't make the connection between--- RIVERS: Colonel? Colonel? Now, Lieutenant. Rivers! [Squelch] How's the rescue plan coming, sir? Perfect. Just grab my feet. [Grunting] Whoa! [Grunting] This is some rescue plan. Dig your heels in. Don't worry. I've got you. Pilates six days a week. [Grunting] [Panting] I don't hear anything. That's good, isn't it? [Roaring] Go! Thanks. No problem. So, you were in Tehran? That's classified. I gather the intel for the President. I know what really happened-- the nukes, the civilian hospital, who really gave the order. [Rumbling] Doesn't matter now! We got bigger problems! Let's go! Damn, we need something more effective to fight that thing. We've got to find something we can make an IED with. Solvents, cleaners-- whatever you can find. Where's the other one? He didn't make it. What's that smell? Don't poke the aliens. Okay. They're filled with ammonia. It's in their blood. Great. So, don't poke the aliens. Fascinating. Something happen to him? No. Looks like he punctured an internal organ filled with some sort of acid. Acid? Can we use that as an explosive? [Rumbling] Uh, depending on what it is--maybe. Lieutenant, you got a lighter? Yeah. Here you go. All right. Looks like we got something we can use. Try to get as much of that as you can. Roger that. How are we doing on repairs? I've almost got everything ready. And I've made the necessary adjustments to get us home... I think. You think? [Rumbling] The system's rebooting. We'll know for sure in about 15 minutes. Excellent. Right, let's get ready to go. The thing is-- I have to object. We need to spend more time exploring. We should gather more information... collect more samples-- No, wait-- There's no reason why we can't. To leave now would be irresponsible. If you'll let me finish-- We have another problem. The fusion generator needs fuel to operate. What kind of fuel? [Creature roaring] Water. Okay, well, that shouldn't be a problem. Ordinarily, no. But, in case you haven't noticed, we don't exactly have working faucets here. And the nearest plumber's over 100 dimensions away. Well, couldn't we all just pee in a cup? Would that work? How much water do we need? Okay. Do we have any water in the room? There's a few liters of the bottled stuff. No, it's not enough. We'll find it. It's the most common substance in the world. Uh, hi. We're not on our world. We'll find it. That's perfect. It'll give us a chance to explore more of the planet. Is this thing portable? How much does it weigh? It doesn't matter. We don't have time. Doctor, with all due respect-- No, we don't have time. According to my calculations, we only have six hours before the aligned conjunction of this dimension with our own suffers quantum collapse. Whoa, whoa, whoa. For those of us without PhD's Once the dimensions fall out of alignment... We're stuck here forever. [Screaming] Protect that machine! Kill it! Kill it! [Roaring] It should have been hit! It should have been hit! O'HARA: Help me with the-- [Roaring] Where is it? [Shouting] [Shouting] [Snarling] Got you. [Grinding] BURK: What's that sound? Is it the roof collapsing? Go! Come on, move! [Screaming] [Grunting] Anybody? Anybody hear me? Anybody?! Over here. Rivers, you okay? [Grunting] I'm okay, Colonel. Just a little shaken up. FAST: Help! Someone's here! Hey! Help! [Grunting] Okay? Are you sure? Yeah. Have you seen Jill? I don't know who Jill is. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just sit down for a minute. Okay, man, this is gonna hurt. I can take it. I can take it. Okay. On three. One... two! Ohh! You trying to rip my whole arm off?! I-- God! I'm sorry. Let me go get something to wrap that up with. You're not qualified! You're not qualified! O'Hara! Murphy! Help! Give me a hand. Take your time. [Grunting] [Grunting] Is Dr. O'Hara okay? We're still looking for her. The machine. What about the machine? O'Hara?! If the machine's damaged, we can't get home. O'Hara. Well, this is a hell of a day. A science experiment goes wrong, sticks us in a monster-filled parallel dimension with six hours to get home. Still not as bad as Tehran. Not yet. Jill! Can you hear me?! Over here. [Grunting] You okay? Been better. But I'll live. All right, how's the machine? [Beeping] Everything looks good. Excellent. Lieutenant, were you able to get any of that nasty blood from the monster? Yeah, got it. Perfect. Let's see if we can find some pipes. Maybe we can make an IED. Roger that. Hey...you sure you're all right? I'm good. Yeah. [Creature roaring] We're not safe here. As soon as everybody catches their breath, we gotta move out. Where are we gonna go? Somewhere where our asses aren't sticking out in the middle of the air. No, we should stay here. [Creature roaring] No, we need to move out. That thing needs of water to operate. Murphy, carry it. Let's go. Yeah. Move out! Okay. You relax. I'll carry it. This isn't heavy at all! Amazing. What do you make of it? The pulse radius is larger than I would've guessed. These meters were, what-- the front of the building? About that. Check this out! Found this half-buried in the dirt! Eh? How come the whole sidewalk wasn't with it? Hm? Why did just bits and pieces seem to get pulled in? Well, I can only theorize. But the energy pulse had the shape of an inverted funnel. The large side was closest to the machine-- our control room. The smaller end of the funnel extended out. By the looks of it, half a click from the machine. So, only small things got pulled in. The further from the machine, the smaller the area it pulled from. [Creature roaring] All right, guys. We need to get going. The forest to the right looks more dense. Where there's more growth, there's water. Oh, my God. Look. I knew it. I just knew it. RIVERS: What do you make of it, Colonel? Looks like a building. Only intelligent life could build something like that. Do you understand what this means? Colonel, look. You see that break in that section of trees? Maybe that's-- Water. We need to get to the water, as quickly as we can. Are you kidding me? There's no guarantee that there's a stream down there. But that is undoubtedly a building built by intelligent life. Or it could be the home of the things that have been trying to kill us. I doubt it. These creatures seem to run purely on animal instinct. There's no way they built that complex structure. I mean, what would happen if a visitor to Earth landed in the middle of the Serengeti instead of Times Square? Wouldn't they assume the Earth was nothing but lions and zebras? I agree with Dr. Fast. But our priority is to get water and get home. Would that be the retirement home, Colonel? We can't turn our backs on such a monumental event. I guarantee you that there is water there. Karen's right, everybody. We could be the first people ever to make contact with alien life. That's an opportunity. I can't believe we're even discussing this. We have less than six hours before we're stuck here forever. So far, nothing we've met here has been even remotely friendly. There is no reason to say who or what lives there will be any different. I don't care. I'm heading to that building with or without you. Is she crazy? She's crazy. I'm not waiting for you-- Hold on! Dr. Fast is right about one thing. There's no guarantee there's water over there, and with time running out, we need to increase our odds. So, we're gonna split up. Lieutenant, take Dr. O'Hara and Mr. Murphy. If you find water, radio us immediately. This is a terrible plan, Colonel-- If you find water, radio us. If we find water, or make contact with intelligent life, we will radio you. We have time, folks. No one gets left behind. Sounds good to me. Lieutenant. Make sure no one tries to head home without us. Keep an eye on these guys, and stay in touch. Will do. You okay with her? [Loads gun] I'll be fine. You want to switch? That'll be negative, sir. Do you understand what this means? The possibilities. What would we say to them? Hey, it's gotta be something great, right? You'll go down in the history books. Imagine what we'll be able to learn from them. Hopefully, we'll learn the location of some water. Other than that, I don't think we're gonna have much time to chit-chat with our new alien friends. I'm sorry about the retirement crack, Colonel. You refused to authorize the strike. The President countermanded your order and left you out to dry. All those people killed. It wasn't your fault that hospital was destroyed. You'd prefer to live in disgrace? Mine is not to reason why. You're quoting Tennyson. What, yours is just to do and die? Something like that. BURK: Hey, Colonel! Dr. Fast! Uh, anyone going to the lobby? What was Dr. O'Hara's theory about that funnel? Is that woman out of her mind? I mean, she'd rather risk getting stuck here forever just to see intelligent alien life? I'm a little curious, of course. I mean, discovering extra-terrestrial life has been one of my life's dreams. My father's, too. But self-preservation comes before that. I mean, we can't take risks with other people's lives like that-- Risks? Like creating a machine that explodes, killing a group of people, and sending nine more to a parallel dimension? [Sighs] I'm sorry. For everything. Well, what do you know? Heh! Is that-- Water. Hallelujah. Is that enough water? No. Not nearly enough. But it's coming from somewhere. Oh, crap. Oh, my God. It's huge. What do we do now? We wait. [Creature snoring] Whoa. Is that gonna do anything? Makes me feel better. Yeah. Me, too. Wait here. [Snoring continues] You have a really hard time listening, don't you? RIVERS: Alpha to Command. Come in, Command. Go for Command. Colonel, we found water. Roger that. What's your location? About two clicks from the hillside. Just about where we guessed there'd be water. One small problem. Go ahead. One of those things is using it to take a bath. Okay, stay where you are. We're gonna head to your location. We have a, uh-- a local next to us, too. Over. Roger that. Rivers out. Colonel, we're going to that building. We have to. This nest just confirms my theory that there are two different types of life here. Those creatures we've encountered live in those nests. Something else-- something intelligent-- built that building. Negative. We have found water. And we need to exploit that opportunity while-- [Roaring] Damn it. You're crazy! You're gonna get us all killed! What the hell is your problem? It's all clear. It took off that way in a hurry. Relax, soldier boy. Relax? I will relax when all of us get home safe and sound... with or without you. Discovering a habitat like this is better for our understanding. And I'm sorry, I don't remember anyone putting you in charge. Poindexter! Get away from the eggs! We are all getting out. Shh. [Creature growls] Go. This way. [Roaring] Why isn't it attacking? I don't know. Beavis... why is that big pissed-off mama looking at you? Oh, no. What did you do? I took an egg. Outstanding. Okay, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna slowly... reach into your pocket, and slowly grab the egg. I just wanted to be famous. I just wanted to go on Fox & Friends and meet Gretchen Carlson-- We're all gonna get home. Shut up! And listen. Now... slowly... carefully... bend down and put the egg on the ground. [Shudders] Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. You really think-- [Snarling] [Roaring] Come on, let's go. Come on. [Panting] I can't believe he did that. Is it following us? I don't think so. Oh, son of a bitch. All right. Come on, let's go. We're going the wrong way. No, we're not. We've got to rendezvous with the others. I'm not going that way. What are you talking about? Colonel... I understand that you won't wait for me. But this is an opportunity I can't pass up. Making contact with another life form. This is crazy talk. Let me rephrase that. Making contact with an intelligent life form is something I can't pass up. Hey... you never know. I just might make it back to you after all. We won't wait. And we won't be here if there's a problem. Tell us what you find, Doc. Thank you. And, Colonel. The President records all security briefings. All conversations, actually. When you get back, those recordings will exonerate you. When we get back. Keep your radio on. Careful. Don't worry. Just a little... bit...more. How's the blasting cap coming? It's coming well. Have you any more bullets? No. That was the last of my ammo. And this will work? It's a classic pipe bomb. It might not kill him, but, uh... it'll certainly give him one hell of a headache. So, how do you detonate it? You just, uh-- You just light the fuse. Wish we had more. Yeah. You and me both. [Clears throat] The Colonel should've been here by now. Alpha to Command. Come in, Command. Colonel? Hey, Colonel, are you there? Where the hell can he be? You don't think anything happened to him... do you? The Colonel and I have-- have been in some real tight situations together. He'll be here. We're running out of time. If it doesn't move soon-- Why don't we just blast the thing with the pipe bomb? It's risky. It might just piss it off. But we're running out of options. I think I've got an idea. How much time do you need to load that machine? About ten minutes. What are you thinking? What exactly are you gonna do with this? You'll see. Thank you. Ohh. Great. No rush. Good luck. Copy that. What the hell was that? [Roaring] [Roaring] Come on, move! Move! That was his plan? It's the worst plan I've ever seen. He's one crazy son of a bitch. We need to get to the water while we can. Ready? Ready. I hope this works. I'm just glad we didn't have to pee into the machine. Hey, water is water. Whatever it takes to get us home. Water's pumping normally. When it reaches 95%, I'll begin the fusion sequence. Easy, pal. Jeez! Colonel, man-- you gave me a heart attack! I'm actually out of bullets, anyway. Sorry about that. I thought you heard me coming. What's the situation here? We gotta keep moving. I tried to use that IED on that thing, but it just took off after me. I barely got away with my life. I guess my plan kind of worked. Rivers! Go, go, go, go! [Roaring] Aaaaah! Aaaaah! I'm gonna begin the fusion sequence. [Gunshots] What? What's happening? [Beeping] I don't know. [Roaring] Remember the last time we escaped by the skin of our teeth? Son of a bitch! Well, this ain't one of those times. Shut it down, or we're gonna lose the whole machine! [Beeping] Go! You want some? [Roaring] Come get some! [Explosion] Got it. [Shrieking] God. How could I have been so reckless? Colonel. Did you see Lieutenant Rivers? Where is he? He didn't make it. What happened to the machine? Did the water not work? It isn't the water. The chamber holding the coolant must have been damaged in the building collapse. We didn't realize it had a slow leak. Without it, the machine can't reach the temperatures it needs to initiate the cold fusion reaction. So, in layman's terms, we're screwed. How do we fix it? It uses simple Freon. Readily available in every hardware store and used in every car on earth. But here-- Ammonia. Ammonia. That'd work. We could use ammonia as the coolant. It's in the same family as Freon. We could get the ammonia from the monster. Wait, that's suicide. Okay. It's not like we've had much luck with these things, but we're gonna capture one or kill one to get the ammonia? But we're not-- This is crazy! It's just crazy! Not if we don't have to use one of the big mamas. How much does this machine weigh when it's filled with water? Well, it expels the hydrogen ion and absorbs the oxygen, so... it barely adds any weight at all. Okay. Grab the machine. I gotta show you guys something. Oh, yeah. Military man, huh? Let the skinny scientist carry the machine. Anything you say, Mr. Military Man. SYNN: Synn to Dr. Fast. Are you there? I'm here, Colonel. Did you get the water? We did, but we've hit another snag. Long story short-- we've got to fix the machine. Have you made it to the building yet? Not yet. I'm close. Soon. Very soon. You don't have much time. Within the hour. I'll be in touch. Roger that. And... I hope you find what you're looking for. [Whispers] You see the nest? Yeah. Well, when Beavis dropped one of the eggs, I could smell the ammonia, just like I did when I killed the first little bastard. So, it's in the eggs, too. How much do you need? Well, I'm guessing I--I could probably get enough out of a couple of the big ones. How are we supposed to get in there without getting killed? We wait. We wait? Again? We don't have much time. Dr. O'Hara, we have to figure something else out. He'll get us stuck here. Or worse, killed. You want to go get one of those yourself? Yeah, didn't think so. That thing's a killing machine. Our best chance for staying alive is to sit tight and wait. How much time do we have? Three hours. Two hours. Which one is it? Two hours. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! This is never gonna work. This is never gonna work. This is never gonna work. This is never gonna work. This is never gonna work. This is never gonna work. Keep it together, Murphy. Well--Well, we're screwed. I mean, I mean, that thing has just been sitting there forever. We don't have much time. We need to find another alternative. We wait. Dr. O'Hara, this is insane. We're never gonna make it. We need to find a solution now. Okay. What do you suggest? Uh...we find Dr. Fast. You know she's right. If there is intelligent life here, we can easily make the repairs and still get out of here. Oh, come on, wake up. She's over two hours away. She's never gonna make it back here on time. This is a mistake. We wait. That's final. Jillian...will you talk to him, please? We're running out of time. Oh! Oh! What are you doing? I thought you told us to wait. I did. I'm trying to check out what's on the other side of the nest. He's not the best under pressure. You think? He's right about one thing-- we're running out of time. We've got to start thinking about Plan B. Which is? I'm working on that. What the hell are you doing? Saving your ass. That's a sinkhole down there. Why don't you look where you're going? [Murmuring] Ohh. Oh, okay, I gotta get out of here. Okay. I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out of here. [Creature snores] Crap, he's running. [Whimpering] [Creature snorts] [Roaring] Ohh! [Creature roars] [Roaring] [Whimpering] Figures. [Roars] [Murphy screaming] We may have another problem. I can't believe he just did that. He's been my assistant for over eight years. He cracked. Some people just can't take it. What was he thinking? I mean, where did he think he was gonna go? Doc... I need you to focus. What do we do now? Plan B. [Sobs] Ohh! Uhh! What are you thinking? We lure it into here, get it to fall in. Once it's stuck, we go back to the nest, we grab the eggs and the machine. All right, these should work. All right. I get the creature to chase me over to here, I grab the vine, swing across, it falls into the hole. Like Tarzan? Yes, Jane. Just like Tarzan. You think it'll work? Absolutely. How much time do we have? Not much. All right. Give me a hand with this. Colonel, are you there? Colonel Synn, can you hear me? This is Synn. How are you, Doc? I've been better. I've hit a few snags. Yeah, we've hit some trouble ourselves. Colonel... I know the window of opportunity is closing. But I'm just about to make it to the building. It's historic. Good luck, Doc. You, too, Colonel. You, too. Synn out. All right, you know what to do. I get the machine out of the nest first. Once I get it back here, then I go back for the eggs. And if something goes wrong... Run like hell. They teach you that at Annapolis? Yeah, it's called strategic redeployment to rear. Okay, we meet back here. Got it. Are you sure about this? Well, I got a card game every Tuesday night. Never miss one. Let's do it. [Snarls] All right. Now you see me. [Snarling] Come on, you big son of a bitch. [Creature roaring] Oh, crap. [Creature roaring] [Roaring] [Screams] [Roaring] Oh, come on. SYNN: Go back, O'Hara! Go back! [Creature roaring] I don't know what happened. It was, uh, chasing me, and then all of a sudden-- It's like it knew I was going for the eggs. Where's the machine? It's still in the nest. I couldn't get it out. Crap. We're running out of time. You got any ideas for a Plan C? You know what? I just might have something. I did it. I've made it. No. It seems pretty intent on protecting these, no matter what. We could use this to lure it away. Poindexter already tried stealing an egg, and it didn't work out too well for him. Well, we'll have to do a better job, then, won't we? Guess we don't have a lot of options. None that I can see. [Twig snaps] [Growls] Get back. Get back! [Roaring] [Growling] [Roaring] [Thud] Come on. Come on. O'Hara, wake up. Come on. O'Hara, wake up. Just tell me that Plan C actually worked. We're running out of time. Let's go. Get me an egg. Whew! That's ammonia, all right. We're gonna need to strain it. How's this? Perfect. I'm gonna need a bunch more eggs. [Creature snarling] [Roars] Dr. Fast, come in. Colonel... the machine is working. I've located our dimension. We're ready to go. We're out of time. I'm sorry. Is this gonna work? Without Murphy here... I'm not sure. Well... now's the time to find out. [Creature roaring] [Police chattering] [Siren blaring] We made it. [Sirens blaring] You first.
