Your secrets will remain intact. Your crown will stay long on your head. Your shoes will last long on your feet. In the power of the Almighty, in the power of the Oshun, in the power of all our Orishas, arise, arise. Adenike, you and your husband, nothing will ruin you two. You will give birth to a son. You will give birth to a daughter too. You will give birth to twins, as well. That will do now. You and your husband will not know suffering, will one day sit and relax the way I am, and enjoy your children the way I am enjoying you now. Adenike, like these bananas you will not be bruised in your marriage. Pineapples are always sweet. Your life will always be sweet. - You look wonderful! - So do you. - Your head wrap, everything, so nice. - Thank you. - You are coming from Lagos? - Mm-mmm. I live here in Brooklyn now. Ah. That's good. ey, I didn't forget everything. - You have cause for me today, Sade. - Uh-huh. To you, dear Adenike, the woman of my life. Mama. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! God bless. This is to ensure fertility... and prosperity. Go on. Put it round your waist. If Ayodele's father were to be alive today... the party wouldn't have ended. I know. He would be dancing... and causing everybody to havin' a good time. Like his sons. Right. Like his sons. That is why... I pray... every day... that to bear him a son... that will be named... George Babatunde Balogun. And this... This is what I used to carry Ayodele on my back. I want you to take it and carry your child with it. Use it to carry my first grandchild. Don't cry, don't cry. Our prayers have been answered. Where's my younger brother? Biyi? Where is he? Biyi! Come sit next to me. Come, come, come. When you fool around... Yemi... No, not me. Pretend as nothing happened. When a goat strays, he must always return home. Because home is where your peace and happiness dwells. Always come home to sleep over. Always come home to eat. And even if you have eaten, come home to eat again. You must provide her with a good home. A home full with children. Get busy. Let's share this with our Orishas, our ancestors, and the Almighty to answer our prayers. Mami. Adenike. You didn't have to do this. I have last night's specials waiting for me. What you make here is for everyone else. What the hell? Delicious. Nike! Hey! Thanks for meeting me. Of course. Look. I match your shirt now. Yeah, exactly. Perfectly. - How are you? - Okay. How are you? Oh, everywhere. It's everywhere. Um... - I need to get this out. - We're gonna go... to this really great store over there... - and get you a new shirt. - No. - I don't need a new shirt. - Yes! I'm fine. I'll just go wash it when I go home. It's fine. Okay. With the new shirt on. Come. - Come, come, come. - Oh, no, no. You doin' all right in there? It is transparent. It's supposed to be. Tuck it in. Like this. You can see everything! - Then go braless. - Hey! Ayodele will love it. It's too much money. You remember Sade? Go there. Okay. Okay. What's this? Sade bought it for me. It's a little transparent. I thought that you would like it. I do, I do, but not for everyone else to see. Go on. - Mama... - Come on, come on. Take another sip. Go on, please. - Twice a day? - Morning and evening. I want to get a job. Join the crowd. I can use my skills. You know how many Africans I know with PhD driving taxis? You want to work? Work for me. Or work with me. I don't want your money, Ayo. I want my own. This thing is not... Can you take the, um... This neckline down a little bit? For what? - All right. - It's very nice as it is. It's beautiful. You know, I'd just like it just to be a little bit lower. Not for this dress. This one is not going to do that. I just want to keep us a secret for now. Okay, I'm just showing you now. Enjoy. - Okay. - Isn't that better? - Ah, it's a little better. - The music is sweet to you now, Adi. Ah! Too loud! Take it. Too loud! Adenike. Mami. It's chilly this morning. What a lunch you packed. Thank you. - He loves you doing this. - I love to do it. You have been married for quite some time. Have you been drinking my aloe? Yes. Well, God has a funny way of dealing with these things. Many women have babies in their 30s. But you haven't. My son worked hard to bring you here. And he will always provide for you. Why are you letting her ruin our lives? I'm not letting her do anything. - This is... - You are. our decision. You will not take another woman? I don't want another woman. Are you going to tell your mother that? Of course I will if she asks me. He lives here now, Ma. He doesn't want someone else. Ayo is not like that. Don't go! I'm talking to you and you're trying to get up. This is not about your wife. This is about your child. Your unborn child. I have everything I want in life. No, you don't! Doctor's office. Yes. Can you spell that? Yes. Okay. Sarah? Yes. Can you hold on, please? Doctor's office. Excuse me. Our offices are closed now, ma'am. Sorry. - The doctor... He... - Has left. - Excuse me. Good night, Melissa. - Good night, Karen. But I need to see him. I can, um, put you on a waiting list. I cannot wait. I have to see him now. - I understand. - No, you don't understand. It's been 18 months. No baby. Have you had any treatments? My mother-in-law's aloe and, uh, some tea. Look. If you like, I can sit down with you and your husband and... My husband? Hold on. - What the hell is this? - Uh-uh! Come on now. What the fuck are you doing? Huh? Uh-uh! Simple, eh? Simple. - AYO. - Where were you today? - Is everything all right? - Fine. We talk later. I'll be home later. We talk. Okay? I went to the doctor today. What doctor? Fertility specialist. Sade knows him. Sade? What is this, her business? He can help us, Ayo. She should get out of it. Get her own husband. I'm not talking about Sade. I'm talking about us. The doctor can help us. He can run tests... everything. On me. And you. More than likely it is me. We can't afford this. We can take out a loan. Or ask my mother for some money. I'm tired. What do you mean you're... - What's this? - Money, Ayo. Money I earned. I got a job. Cleaning. I thought it could help now. No wife of mine needs to clean. No. We can use the money. Every day I work hard so you won't have to. It is a way to have what we want. With what? $200, $300? It's 500... and 47. It get us nothing! Didn't you see the prices the doctor gave you? It can help us, Ayo! Please! Come. You know what will help? Please, trust me. But why? Why is it always the woman? Yeah. I don't understand why you don't just tell him. And have him and my mom down my throat? They're not going to be down your throat. Babe, this is the one thing in my life that... he's not involved in. And I'd like to keep it that way. Okay. Watch your step. Watch your step. Watch your step. Watch your step. All right. Last stop, everybody. Pass up a fin. Thanks. Thanks. Fin, fin. - Last stop. - Okay. Okay. Now, do you know Psalm 121? - Yeah. - You need to recite it every day. - Okay. - It'll be good for you. - Okay. - Go ahead. Go ahead. You'll be fine. - You will be fine. - Thank you. Take this with you. - Go ahead. - Thank you. You know how men are back home. He is not home. You know, I have to go. Nike. I have friends... who have adopted. I want it to be from me. How? How, if he will not go to the doctor? Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us all our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation... but deliver us from all evil. For thine is the kingdom... the power and the glory... forever and ever. Amen. So you are blaming my son now. I'm not blaming anyone. - Adenike. - Yeah? - Go home. - Home? And give your husband your consent. What then? What happens when that woman does not get pregnant? Or the next? Talk to Ayodele. That is all I ask. - And say what? - Get him to go to the doctor. He can help us. - You want to help Ayodele? - Yes. You know what to do. Amen, amen, amen to Jesus. It's the same blood. Only a woman truly knows who the father is. What? To stick together as a family? Other women do it. Biyi. Did you get my messages? I called you and left messages and you don't call me back. Your brother brought you here and has taken care of you. I'm talking to you! It is high time you did something for him. Get along now! I brought your brother's lunch. He's at the fish markets. I have to... Biyi. I need to talk to you. Not about the lunch. - I have to go and prep right now. - No. Please. Please, please. It will not take long. I promise. You know... Your brother and I... We've been trying for long... for very long to have a baby. It might be me. But if it is not... then another woman does not make sense, sure you understand. I have to go and do some work in the kitchen. No! You know what this means to him. - I have to go inside... - He is a good man. I have to go inside the kitchen. And you also. You are a good man. Please, eh? I do not know what else to do. What are you doing today? Oh, I'm... just going shopping with Sade. Do you have money? Say hi. Whenever you want, I'll go with you to the doctor. You know you wanna take the day. I had a day. Hey! You have strong toes. That day was two weeks ago. I'm lucky I even have a job. Hold on, hold on. Sorry. Hello? Hey. That's great. Oh, that's so great. Hold on. Nike's pregnant. I'm so happy. Did you talk to my brother? Why isn't he meeting us here? Thank you. Sorry I'm late. Look who the cats dragged in. - Mami. - Why you always late? I'm sorry. It's not my fault. - Congratulations! - Oh, thank you. Congrats, mama. Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you. - Thank you. - So big already! Hey! Hey, everybody! You are so funny. - Grab a seat. - Ah, okay. Just bring this seat here. Sit next to the mama. - You all right? - Okay. Feels good, doesn't it? Shoot mama. You better don't shoot me. Beautiful, Mama. Beautiful. Adenike. So when is Babatunde going to arrive? November 23. November 23? Now we know... what lotto number we supposed to play. Where is Biyi? - Make him come out. - Biyi, Biyi, Biyi! Biyi, Biyi! - Let's make a toast. - Hey, hey. One sec. One sec. You're supposed to wait for the baby to come out before you do that. Well, we can have the party anytime. Now we know the baby gonna come. Well, well, well, well, well, well. What a day this is, huh? Of God's making. To be blessed like this, after so many years. I never got to see my father before he died. But it is as if he is coming back to me through Babatunde. - Amen. - To my miracle! You know what? Get together. Get together. Let's take a picture. Come, my miracle. Be in the middle. Be there in the middle. Come. Ready? One more, one more, one more, one more. My mama sat back. That means you are accepted into the family. Coming. - Where is Biyi? - Biyi is not here. - Yes, but where is he? - How do I know? - You married Biyi? - No, I didn't marry... - So work! - I'm just working... I need Biyi. Forget about Biyi. You have customers! You have customers! Don't yell at me. Monica. Here, here. Thank you. Don't you know what I do here? So... what's next? Where were you last night? The sketch for the new cabinets. Good. You want to be part of this business or not? Sorry. I forgot. Tunde didn't forget. Look. It's no big thing, okay? I'm sorry. Next time it's no big thing, tell me. That way I won't keep waiting for someone who isn't going to show. When are you gonna grow up? You know how much those chicken breasts cost me? Every night it's something. Three nights ago... he overcooked three of the specials. It's okay, it's okay. And then he burned the Joloff rice. I don't know what's been eating him... but whatever it is, I'm sick of it. How does he expect to be partners... if he is not holding up his end of the bargain? Maybe he's just tired. You know he likes to stay out. Tell him he shouldn't stay out. He's not a kid anymore. I'll get it. Hello? Uh, my address? Sure. Well, okay. All right. Thanks. He's right. I should leave, go somewhere else. - Where? - I... I don't know. You have a life here. What life? I go to sleep, wake up, piss thinking about it. And it's only going to get worse. It is what he wanted, Biyi. What he wanted... to be lied to day after day? I don't think so. I can't do it. Maybe you can, but I... You what? You what? I want it over with. What are you saying? What are you saying, Biyi? Just tell him. Just let him know. You can't! You can never do that! Are you teaching him burping? Do not waste time. Somebody is selling a used car, I know you need a car. The car we bought last year still works, maybe when business picks up. This is a boy. So what do you think, Son? Are your feet ticklish? What about your hands? Will you have mine, or your mama's? And about your teeth, eh? You want your father's? See how bright they are? And strong. Only two cavities. To tell you the truth... whatever you look like will be perfect. As long as you have my teeth. What? Is it about earlier? I know I went off, but... What's wrong? Ayo. What? Biyi. He what? The baby. Biyi is the father. Stop talking rubbish. It's not. Your mother... My... My mama what? It's the same blood. It's not fucking okay for me to take another woman, but it's okay for you? It's not the same. Biyi would never, ever... replace you in our marriage. You did! Ayo. We both did. Where are you going? Ayo! Where did it happen? Where did it happen? Hello, darling. I said, where did it happen? Is it me you are yelling at? Is there no more respect at all? I am still your mother. Did it happen in your bed or mine? How's your wife? A child... a child belongs to us all. It doesn't matter who the father is... It does matter to me! You know it is you they are going to call the father. No, Biyi is the father! At least admit what happened... what you made happen. I don't want to disrupt your house. Which house? It is not only my house you have disrupted. You have disrupted my mind. No more marriage. I'm walking out. What do you want everyone to think? Yes! All the better! Let them know who she is, what she has done. What good will that do? Do you want everyone to know what is going on? In your room? In your bed? Let this be between you and your wife. This woman loves you. She loves you dearly. That is the honest truth. Okay, okay, okay. What is it? He walked out. What do you mean he walked out? Okay, okay, okay. Okay, come. Honey, are you... Okay... Nike, wait. You know, you talk a lot of shit. About wanting a different life. Then you go and do this. You could have refused. You could have talked to me. Told me what the fuck was going on. - Showed me that you gave a shit. - I do. You don't have a mind of your own. He's my brother. What can I tell you? Wow. You don't get it, do you? Get what? He's my brother. What the fuck is wrong with your head? Don't you think with it? I want you to get another job. I don't give a shit what it is or where you go as long as you stay out of my life. What made you tell your husband? You should not have told him. I couldn't live like that. Ayo! Ayo! Ayo! Don't do this. You made me into a fool... all of you! No, Ayo, please. Ayo, I didn't know what else... It was out of love! Why else would I... My whole life has been about pleasing you. Giving you what you wanted. What I wanted was for you to be my wife, no one else's! I'm still your wife! I am still your wife! Ayo? Ayodele? I know you are in there. Nike. Ayo. Please. Don't say no. If you want it... Please. Just come with me to the airport to pick up Mama. She knows nothing, Ayo. Nothing. Ayo. Tell me your name now. It's okay. Take your time. Adenike. Adenike? That's beautiful. Adenike, my name is Dr. Greene, okay? You're gonna be fine. It's okay. You're gonna be fine. Dr. Greene. I'm gonna take you back with me, okay?
