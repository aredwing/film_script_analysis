The convict being released from the Canyon City penitentiary today is looking for trouble. - Give him some! - I don't want any trouble in my town. Me and my boys, there's all we can't handle. - The first place he's probably heading for is Weed City. - We'll find him. - Then he could come up here to Gun Hill. - It will never happen. - Here's $ 500, For that you watch him. - Oh, we'll watch him. Yes, indeed! Which ever way he heads after leaving Weed City, you let me know. For that, you'll get another hundred dollars in gold. And don't wink that eye of you again. I'm not buying to kill him. If you kill him, you'll get nothing. Maybe even a something little worse. A man finishing stressing a place like that, must be pretty old. I got my age. This man got a name? Clay Lomax. - Clay Lomax! - All right, main warden. I'd wish you to have kept those. I was counting on you getting a fixing coming right back here. I ain't getting in any trouble until I find the trouble that I want. I say this for you, warden... - You've been one mean son-of-a-bitch. - Likewise. I know you hate me, but not as much as you hate somebody out there. I'll see you soon. Good afternoon! The no. 12 to Kansas City, when is it coming through? No. 12 from Kansas City? Tomorrow morning at 9 'o clock. Oh, give or take an hour. - Is Trooper still in business? - Trooper? No don't get up in my time. Yes, he's still in business. Right down the street. Right next door to... Next door to what? I didn't quite hear you. - To the bank. - Next door to the bank. Stockman's Bank. Yeah. Times for eyes seeing ghosts! What the hell are you doing here? I just wanted to see if there's any of my blood still on the sidewalk. They wore all. They let you or you busted out? Nobody busts out of Canyon City. - It don't seem like seven years! - Just to me I've done them. You would have gotten out heap sooner if you'd name the other man. So they said. He shot you in the back. He must have been a stranger. No. - You knew him. - I did?. - You did. - My partner. - Sam Foley! Well, I'll be... Well, that's what they call water under the bridge. Where is he? Who? Oh, Sam! - He's long gone. - Gone where? - He's gone. Save yourself from charging that drink, Clay. Nice to see you're back. See, I've been on something else you ain't having seven years. All of them new. Fresh of from the farm. A real live bunch of rubber dolls. - Ain't not one of them over twenty. - Sam Foley... How much? How much? - $ 200. - That ain't enough. That's all I have got. Now where is he? - Where's your two hundred dollars? - There's a woman holding my money in Kansas City. Kansas City, hell! - Ain't no woman kept nothing for 7 years. - On the way, it'll be here tomorrow. - Why did you have her send here? - It all started here. It's the last place I saw him. It ain't much money. You don't know how bad he's gone. Respectable bad! I probably would get twice as much money from him for not tell you where he is. Let's say I told you where you could find Sam for $ 200... - What would you do? - Pay you, and kill him. Muchachas! - Hey Grand's! Folk's bourbon, a new bottle! - I don't know if you're is old enough? Oh now, we're old enough. And you're old too, grands. You want glasses or I just put a nipple on the bottle? You watch your mouth. This here is Bobby Jay. Bobby Jay!? That is just a divine name! I just couldn't say no to a drink! - They call me Alma. - How old are you? - Twenty. Well, you still got a couple of good years left. I bet he's a hundred. - That's old enough for five people. - If he was a turtle he would be young. I've heard about a turtle to be 400. What would people took to living that long? Alma, where did you get that shine up? Did you do rubs up the wall? Stepped on the toes! That's a good one. People ought to be like those, when they get too old you just shoot them. And it's gonna come to that. If they don't there ain't gonna be enough room. - Who will say who's who? - Well me, honey. Sooner or later it would become your turn. Because if you live, you get older. And if you live enough, you get old. Pepe! You all hear something? Did you hear, Alma? Bobby Jay, come on, Bobby Jay. Let's gonna snuggle. You all want to snuggle? - Now they want to snuggle too. - Yeah well, sure! We got Looloo, Penzy, and Berta... - No, we've got you. - No, I am sorry. - Oh Alma, these are my boys. - No. Just you and me. You and me, and Skeeter! What? All right. - Three Musketeers! Pepe! - Last again! But grateful! - You got to pay 6 pence for that bottle! - We just keep going, friend! If you asks me, the old one should kill the kids. We were talking about Sam Foley. Get your money and we'll talk some more. Emma! - Emma wouldn't still be around with you? - Emma, come here! Oh, Clay! - You still give them good neck poppers? - Turn around. You're mad about something? He's hot all over. I don't want to hear about it. - We'll talk. But hell, I've always liked that fellow. - So did I. Until I stopped. That's where they dug the bullet out? Yeah, they dug it out of there. But they didn't dig it out of your mind. Bobby Jay! Come on, Bobby Jay! Let me in! Will you shut up, for Christ sake! - Let me in! - Shut up! Bobby Jay! Come on, Bobby Jay! Will you let come in too? - Bobby Jay, come on! - Shut up! - Bobby Jay, I want to come in! - You're disturbing the peace. - Peace of what? Let's cut out the jokes. And keep the mouth shut. You got your stubborn boots on, Bobby Jay. Stop him. - That sure is a broke of knife. - I'd like to break the rest of it all on his liver. - Watch you said, but don't touch you said. - No one has slapped me, not even my father. Don't forget what Mr. Foley said about that killing! - He tried to kill you. - He will try it again. - Not much of a horse. - Could enough for a gift but not much cash. Well, I guess he could carry you and all that money. I hope your memory is as big as your mouth. I want a lot of answers for all that money. You'll get them. You're Clay Lomax? Do you know a Teresa Ortega? I have got something for you. My name is Decky. My mommy told me to call you Theo Clay. That means Uncle Clay. - What the hell is this? - Just as it looks like, a small female child. I was told to deliver her to you. My mom says you always wore a Texas hat. That's a Colorado hat. I was expecting an envelope. Is there any rules that I got to take it? No... no company rule. We got to take out water. Make up your mind, mister. Her mother started out with her, but she died just outside Kansas City. - Died? From what? - Men, the doc said. She'd not even been thirty. She looked more like fifty. Anyway, we took her off and buried her. - What happens if I just leave her on the train? - To you? Nothing. - To her? The first town we hit that's got a Marshall I'd hand her over. Wait a minute. We found this piece of paper pinned on the kid. It's got your name on it. Well now, maybe you're better off. After what do you expect from a man who changes his hats? - Decky. What's your last name? - Ortega. - No, that was your mother's. Your father's? - I ain't got no father. - Everybody has got a father. - You're about five years old maybe? - Six, going on seven. - Six, going on seven... - Well, how does it come out? Do you leave her here or some place else? She didn't have a name printed out of nothing. - Someone has a mean sense of humor. - Mean to you, or her? There ain't no law that says you got to accept shipment. I can't hold up this train waiting for you to figure what a way to weasel out. Watch your mouth. Forget it, mister. I just carry her over to a Marshall. Someway down the lines. Maybe it will be better off. A man who changes hats. Oh, hell! - Come on, kid. - I won't! - Come on! - I don't want to go with him! - You have decided? - Yeah. If you don't get this, you didn't take that. Please don't leave me here! Please! Please don't leave me here! Please! Don't leave me! I don't want to go with you! - Now limber. - I won't. If you don't then I'll drop you on your little rump. Put me down. You hate me! I don't want to go! This ain't never gonna go away. I will remain a huge black eye. - How much sugar? - Bastards! I says to him, do anything you want but please don't touch my poor eyes. Well, that was it! Red blank as a bull. - Did he smack you? - No! Right in the eyes. I'm so dumb. I should have known! He just got to do what a girl says he can't. I got you just the thing for you. I sell these little bastards, to the bar-fighters for a dollar each. - I just thought it in connection with a female. - What the hell is them? - Real live Mexican bloodsucker worms! - Well, them is leeches. - It draws the color right out of the skin. - I will not. Shoot honey, I wouldn't do you no mean trick. Watch! Put one of those on your cheek and you'll get a complexion like a new-born babies. You know something? I forgot to collect my money. - From them three fellas? - Yeah. - I didn't know how much I'd charge. - Just powder your eye and drink your coffee. Collecting money, that's what men are for. Now, Who would do a thing like this to a man's property? Some low-cow-shagged tail with a knife and he must have had it done like this. - All this damages on you're gonna be billed! - Mister, don't rouse him before breakfast. I'm gonna take an inventory of all you damaged, burned or busted! - Pour us some coffee. - Pour your own. - Pour! What is them things? - Well, that's her breakfast. - No. You gotta be kidding me! Alma will eat anything you give her. Eat them thing, Alma! - Bobby Jay! - What? - Only he'd done was meet a train. - Well, did he get on that train? - No. Very interesting. Come on! What else did he do? He stole a little girl, about so high. It looks like he's bringing her here. It sounds like an old Bank robber is gone white slave trader. Now you hear that, Alma? Lomax is bringing your replacement! - Is she gonna eat this thing? - Well, sure she's gonna eat that thing. - Do you want to see? - Trooper! - You give me my money! - What money? - From last night. - Oh the hell, you owe us. Pepe, what'd you think we ought to charge? I don't know. She had a nice roll in her purse! Give her back her purse! Give her back her purse stay down! - You tore that wall and you're gonna pay! - We ain't paying for nothing, grands. We are getting paid. - Pepe, see what's in that cash drawer. - Watch your line. I've got a gun at you! Well now, I declare? You've drawn your gun on me. - Why did you do that? - Self-defense. - He's dead! - Not. - Oh, yes he is. Well, that's right Skeeter, we are three musketeers. - Next! - Bobby Jay Jones, I swear... What is that, is our blood brother going back on his solemn word? Get the money out of the drawer! Do you know how to cook? Wrong! You know to cook! You'd just hide on. Come on. - Trooper! - Tell clay... - Clay is gone. Gun... Hill. My mom says no cowboy ever walks when he can ride. - Sit right there, or I'll whirl you. - No, you won't. It's Trooper! - Them three kids shot him. - Did they? - Yeah. And then they left, took Alma with them. Did anybody going after them? Nobody yet. Before he died he said your name and something about Gun Hill. - Gun Hill? - Yeah. - I'd pay a weight. - I'm sorry. - I never had kids, never wanted none. I'd ran away from you anyway. It seems to me you are the right one. She got to go to school anyhow. I can't board any children, all I can do to teach them. - What do you teach them? Look out for yourself? - Yes. No! But preacher you are my last hope left in this town I can turn to. I suggest to turn this responsibility over to the Marshall. To the law? Turn her over to the law? Preacher, you know I've done bad things in my day but nothing that bad. Reverend, you're harder than hard. I'd say you are mean. Perhaps. But not mean enough to try to get rid of a child in her presence. - You've got any soap? - No. - Well, I have. - You stink. You got to have a bath. - No! - Now shove them rags. - No! - Get them off or I'll do it for you. - I won't! - You bastard stinkpot, it's cold! - What did you say? You bastard stinkpot! You say that again and I'll scrub your dirty little mouth! - What about you? You stink too! - If I've finished with you I'll take mine. - Are you my father? - What kind of fool's question is that? But since you're so curious... Me and your mama was friends of us, a hundred years ago. - You're not an uncle. - No. I sure had a lot of uncles. But they were no good. Mama said no man was any good. - On the third time she came to visit. - Visit? Where? She lived with other ladies. I stayed with folks. - What folks? - Different ones. The last ones didn't want me to keep my cat. They threw stones at her. - As long as they didn't hit her... - They did! They killed her. The place I'm taking you to are friends of mine, they'll let you have a cat. - I don't want any more cats. - The Nelsons got a nice place, a real farm. It's still a far piece. We better get going. That ain't the way to Gun Hill! Why are we getting here, Jay? You got to tell Sammy we cut out for Mexico, to get our money, huh? - Oh now, you're thinking for me? - No, no! I'm sure have a fine running cards. It looks like the Nelsons had the same. Indians! What are you figuring, scout? - Navajo or Apache? - I don't know. - Is it Indians? - Worse. Worse than Indians, Decky. - That there is the smell of hard times. - Are you funning me? - No. There ain't nothing else smells that bad. Let's fix us a campfire, so we can make that stink go away. Hey, you told me you could cook! If you're pulling a gun, I would tell you I could fly! And you walking on water and turning sticks into snakes! You told me a lie. - Yes. - Yes? Why? - I told a lie. Don't you think you ought be punished for that? Punished? One eye is swollen shut, the other is smoke blind. I'm too stiff to stand up and I'm too sour to sit down. - Plus I'm sun burned. How are you gonna punish me? - Oh, there's ways. Bobby Jay. Come let me rustle up something to eat. That girl is a mess. Well, that's true. But I want her to cook. And when I want someone to do something, the do it. - Now, you see anything? - It seems Lomax is settling down for the night. He got a nice fire going too. How high you reckon a man can flap a jack? - Where did it go? - A schooner bird, he stole it in mid-air. That was my pancakes! Schooner bird is the only one thing that can eat and fly. Maybe because they fly backwards. - Backwards? To keep the dust out of their eyes. They live on flapjacks, chewing tobacco and hard-rock candy! - Damn you bird, bring it back! - Cursing won't fetch nothing of them. Here, you give me your plate. There's an Apache magic trick that will get it again. Now you keep it covered and held tightly. I will say the magical words. - You got the hold tight? - Tight! - Repeat after me. - Hoki-Poki! - Hoki-Poki! - Dame Noki! - Dame Noki! - It didn't work. - Of course it always works. Did you look? You swallow it down and get some sleep. We've got places to go coming morning. Can you ride a horse? - I'm doing that now? - No, I mean by yourself. Of course. They'd always let me ride... - ...when I get to the livery stable. - The livery stable? - What kind of job did you hold out? - I cleaned up the stables. What did they pay you for that? I told you! They let me ride the horses. Well, if I'm gonna drag you all the way to Gun Hill, what you need is a pony. We'll cut out that little one. - That's stealing! - They're wild horses, they don't belong to nobody. At the next ranch we come to, I'm gonna swap that little coat for a saddle. Come on now. Get down. Get him! Get him! Get him! Get him! Hooray! Hooray! You got him! - He's a nice little gentleman, ain't he? - May I pet him now? - You just don't let him pick a hug out of you! - I know to do with horses. It is stealing! I won't let you! - You're trying to put me in my place? - It is stealing! Oh, you're tougher than wrang leather. All right. Damn it! Go on back. What's wrang leather? It's something that don't come apart in the rain. - No doubt about! He's headed toward Gun Hill! - Yeah. That's all I need to know. So? We cut across these hills and tell Mr. Foley, right? Wrong! The man wants trouble. I don't care if you are mad at me! If you'd done as to the pony, you wouldn't have fallen out of your mother. I wasn't took away from her, she was taken away from me. Wranged leather. Again? Don't get snake bit! Why don't you get upon him and shoot that old man and little girl, huh? We can wait up here for you until you get back. I don't want to catch up to him yet. I want to have some fun with him! Shoot him? Shoot him? That's no fun, Alma. You don't have any imagination. It's either in bed, or on out. You know he's right. No, I don't. You know that I spent the whole night in lobby listening. We're making it up to you now. I bet you ride with her. Don't you feel good? - Damn! Look at that thing! - What? She got split my bridges with that big behind. I can't help it. You want me to ride this horse all naked! That's bad, Alma! - You know what's happens to bad girls? - Don't do that. - What's the matter Pepe? Don't you like to have fun? - Sure I do, but... Well alright then, we're gonna have some fun! Yes, we are! You know I think you're horse-crazy. They're nicer than people. How would you like to have him? - I'm stealing it. - I know! - Why ain't you kicking about it? - The foal had a mom, this one doesn't. They have got an owner. We could tell that it was wild pony, in the pasture and couldn't jump out. You're growing up fast. - Do you know what they do with horse-thieves? - They hang them. Good day! - Good afternoon! - I make it morning. - I think I've seen that pony before. - I got him out your coral back there. Do you want to get rid of him? I could be I left the gate open. That little scrub like him I figure it might be worth... ...a couple of dollars. He has got a sentimental value. It belonged to my late wife. - Why don't you put a sentimental price on him? - Oh, uh... 20 dollars? - Do you've got a saddle with him? - My late wife. She ran off. With a knife with her. Saddle that... that'll run you another 10. - It'll be a nice outfit for the little lady. - He's just trying to smooth me down. Well, is that so, little lady? And what for? He's been trying to dug me off, every place we go. I could stay here, then you will have to buy me a pony. - Let's get on with the deal. - Hmm... - $ 15 for the pony and $ 5 for the saddle. - $ 15 for the both. Count out your money! Your name is El Sueno, that means dream. Her name happens to be Patty. El Sueno! - I won't eat that. - Why not? Rabbit is good. - It makes me think of my cat. - I won't eat it. - What the hell will you eat? - Flapjacks. - You can't eat them every day. - Let me take a look at them legs of yours. - They're all right. You go eat that cat. Don't you speak out. That's saddled up and raw. That's my good Indian jacket. It's about to become a good Indian vest. - These'll make good leggings for you. - You spoil my jacket. I won't wear no legging! - You will. One more day like today and your feet will break off. - No, I won't! They've been down for the night. It looks like. Pepe, take over. Move! - Yes, sir! - Yeah General, you got yourself one hell of a an army. Give me a drag. - I gave you an order. - Yes, sir! It's you own fault for not doing what you're told. Get out there and watch! Give me all the guns! Right Here! Put your hands on your heads! Turn around! Is he still carrying that knife in his boot? Get it. Your friends... ...they took turns gunning old Trooper in his wheelchair. Shot hit him in the belly, so he died real slow. You know what happens when you got shot in the belly? You can't move. You can't breathe. You feel yourself filling up with blood, with pain. And you can't die! Lomax, you know I got a man covered you! You had a man. This is his gun! - Don't shoot me in the back, please! - You've been trailing me. Why? Who sent you? We got orders to do you no harm and we've done you none! - Who? - Don't nobody do no talking! - You tell him! Don't let him shoot me! Sam Foley. What Skeeter told you is true! They got orders not to kill you! Just to follow you and let know when you come to Gun Hill. - Does Foley know? - He sure does! And I'd think hard on that... You bitch! Any more? - I'm leaving you your horses, punk. - Maybe I see you again. Just do your little choir, punk. You tell him I'm coming. Just tell him. I know you what you are. A holdup man. That's what. All that damn shooting last night. I thought you tried to murder another rabbit. - Rabbits don't carry guns. - Oh shut up and ride. Let's stick to the road, we get to Gun Hill a lot faster that way. Oh, shut up! Maybe he's right. The way Lomax is going, he won't get there before tomorrow morning. - And we got to let Foley know. - Not without my gun! - It's gonna start raining again. - Yep. It's getting dark too. You used to talk a lot, and now you're getting crumpy like a... father. Did your mother ever tell you who your father was? She only told me he was a good-looking bastard. Hey, mister. Come on in out of the wet! - I'll take care of your horses. - I'll give you a hand. - I don't need it. You go on in. You know how to blow dry my pony? Brush her with a straw. Yes, ma'am. - Come in. Bring the child out of the rain. - The rain will dirt up your floor. Well, bring that child in. Come on, let's dry you all. - Mrs. Farell, I can filth my shirt until next week. - Good. How about your shirt? It's not my shirt, it's his. More coffee for Mr. Lomax, Dutch. Where do you go to school? - I don't go anymore. I'm all through. - So soon? - Where did you go before you graduated? - Kansas City, Kansas. Oh my, that must've been very interesting. - You got a school around here close? - No, sir. Ma has been teaching me at home. Next year he starts at Gun Hill. - I like coffee, and I'm almost as old as you are. - Sure. That isn't real coffee. That's what my momma calls tender coffee. It'll be tough enough to get it into you. - Where are you gonna sleep? - In here with you. We won't crowd each. - Where is he gonna sleep? - There a tow bed in Dutch's room. Is that what you call Mr. Lomax, "He"? - His first name is Clay, but I don't call him much. - Now don't you get too settled down there. - I got to be moving on the minute this rain quits. - Oh that won't be for a while yet. The creek is up. And that means my boys won't be back until tomorrow morning. You just settle down all you want to, my dear. That is a real nice woman for a lady. She's bringing her boy up right, and she's got a fine place here. - Not a bad spot to hold out. - And a nice hayloft to play in. - Like it's not? - Not for me, she says "my dear". But I'm not her dear. Go to sleep. - You're not gonna skin out on me? - Go to sleep. - I won't stay here. - You'll stay where I plant you. Oh, what's that letter? The first one? - It's an A. - What's the next one? - M. - How do you know? - I can read and can also write. - How about arithmetic? Numbers? Well... I worked in banks. - I bet there's still things I could teach you. Lots of things - You go to sleep, damn it! You're in a big damn hurry, just to get out there to her. No pasting! Or I'll soap your mouth. That's a lot of guns going there. You want me them to hole them down? No, thanks son. Just leave it be. - I'm going to bed. Good night, sir! - Good night! If you're gonna burn coal my friend take one of your school books. I ain't that wide awake. - He looks like a fair enough boy. - He's got his flaws, but he is my son. - Yo do that pretty handy. - Actually, I'm a bit rusty. It's the first time I pour a drink for a man since my husbands died, five years. Is Decky your daughter? What would you say? One minute, yeah, but the next minute... Well, I ain't sure myself. - Is any man ever sure? - Now ell, with some women... Do you really believe that or do you just want to believe it? That child troubles you, doesn't she? I guess I feel sorry for her. She'd be mad as hell if she knew that, but she don't even know how little she is. It seems to me she shied off pity, like most people. - I've trying to find somewhere to board her. I'd pay. - I'd keep her for you. - No pay. - I'd have to pay as long as I could. There is something that might come up to prevent. You're a generous woman. I'm selfish. This is a female practicality. - If you leave her here, you'll come back. - Cards on the table, I might keep on moving. I'll take that gamble. I could tell you a tale about being a wandering Willie. I'd make you some damn sweet promises. But there is that kid in there. You ought to know it all. - You look at a man that just got out of the pin. - You don't have to tell me anything. You better know about this. Seven years ago my partner and I picked a bank. My partner, my friend... call it double-cross, call it betrayal. Now you see there's something I got to do. - And it might put me back there. - I'll take that chance. You sound like a man offering a man a job. I'm not a man. The offer stands. I'll keep the child. And there will be no more talk about tomorrow. Throw the dice, took the coin. Come with me. It's always now, really. Isn't it Clay? I said I hadn't poured a drink for a man for five years. That's true. But when my workmen are in the bunkhouse... ...and Dutch is in his bed, I pour. For me. Until I'm drunk. Do you understand? Until I'm drunk enough to turn off the tomorrows. And a little bit more to turn off the now. And a little bit more to sleep alone. - Leaving to a rain bull-party on a dry ground! - You didn't do like I told you. - Like you told me? Pepe, get the arms. - You're a pissin' punk. - I should have stepped on you back there. - You'll be sorry, you didn't do that. - Do you know them? - Not like he's good. - You got your guns, keep on traveling. Gun Hill is just down the road. It got two whorehouses, a hotel and Sam Foley. - Is there anybody in there? - There's nobody your size. Get in here! - The is nobody in that bunkhouse. - I have four men working in this ranch. - They'll be back from town, any time now. - Oh, now I'm getting scared! They'll be liquored up, carrying their guns. I'd get out of here. - Is there any guns in there? - No, sir. - I believe you. You gonna take a look, Skeeter. - Are there any guns in that other room? - No. - Now, I believe you too. But Skeeter won't. You take a good look, Skeeter! Go on, take a look in there. - I got rid of them guns, put horses in the barn. - I've got another job for you. - Well, make it quick, I'm hungry. - Quick? That dummy here wants me to make it quick. That old man got us all while him sleeping on duty. - Can you imagine that? - Bobby Jay, don't start that again. You will ride one mile down to Gun Hill, and you will sit out in that rain and wait. And if you see any ranch-hands ridings up, you're gonna fire your gun 3 times and come here. - Damn! - You said what? - Nothing. - Cover them. Make them go away. - Is that old man your hero? - Yeah! He was better than all of you together! So you better watch out! Don't you know he's just an old jail-bird and yeller! He's not yeller! He's not do nothing. And I was slapping you, he still wouldn't do nothing. - 'Cause you got guns! - You cook. You do tend the horses. That's right, baby, we got the guns! Don't unsaddle them, just grain. Move, boy! - What's she to you? - She's my mother. If you be back in 10 minutes, I'll shoot you in the kidneys. I told you it we'd have some fun. Fun? I didn't even laugh since I met you. Now is that a way to talk to your man? My man, wouldn't let me stand about in wet clothes. You'd take them off. Come on do that over by that fireplace so I could watch you all nice and rosy. Come on, do that thing! Not in front of the children! You just keep cooking, Mama! You ain't no angel! - I've seen that through the window. Didn't see it all, though. - Well, we will. - Don't push your luck! - Get over there. Move! We'll be happy! He Mama, you got a leaky roof! You better patch that thing! Hey, we're supposed having a party, Mama. Why don't we eat from these fancy dishes? No, they belonged to my grandmother. Then, they're too old! They've been here long enough. Look at that hand! Sometimes I don't think it's me at all. - That little boy, Pepe... - Huh? - What about him? - I'll bet you a dollar he'd done the smart thing. - Such as what? - He cut out. - Shut up! Now Pepe is stupid. Too stupid to come in out of the rain. - I'll bet another dollar he is dry. - What? - In the rain? - Rain, hell. He's in Sam Foley's house by now. Maybe we got to ride on in, huh? That man is trying to pull your leg. And to split us up. Goddamn, let's get on with it. Let's get some fun. Mama, give me that cup up there, gimme the one with roses on it. Oh come on, Mama! Have you folk ever heard of the Switzer that got the apple up on the son's head? By the name of William Tell. - What we need is a son! And we got one! - No! Now I bet we can use you. Now I didn't hear you say "no"! Well, our story says it was a kid's head. So any kid will do. So you can say which one. - Alright then, I'll pick the head. - Not him! - Okay, then you, over by the fire place. - Why don't you use my head? Move! Go on. Put this cup on her head. Then put it on your own kid! Well, what do you know! A little lady gun! Damn! But somebody forgot to put the caps in! Oh, I wanted him to see this. - That is shooting! - No, my hand was aiming at the handle. Wasn't you aiming at the handle? Okay boy, you give me the next cup. Gimme the one with the flowers on it. Scaredy cat. No! You little son-of-a-bitch! You leave her... I think that rain has gone let off. Okay, Mama! Next! Give me the one with the daisies on it! Well... Well, what's the hell the matter with you? Oh, I see, sure. It says I need a little nerve-tighter. What do you think Alma, you think my shooting hand is steady enough to perform? I can not stand the sight of you in those clothes. Before you do take them off, you get to shoot the next one. Come on! Do you want to try? Huh? Drop that, Lomax! I said 1... No, don't! He's got one shot left! He shot the floor, two teacups, her and him, that's five shots! Shut up and get over there! One is all I need! Now you know I don't mess around, Lomax. You stand there until you hear my horse. You move, and she stops moving. Get out the lights. My gun is on the table. About Decky ad my son... I had to make that choice. If it had been the other way around, I'd probably had done the same. Put on your clothes, I'll get the horses! No! He is lame! - Ain't they coming? What do you do with that kid? - Get down! I need your horse! This is my horse! I wouldn't let you ride to Gun Hill on my horse! He's a good horse! And you'll only kill him, the way you kill everything you lay your hand to! You should not have said that, Pepe! You really shouldn't have, Pepe. Decky! Decky! Wait! Here I am! Wait! Here I am! Wait! That is the God's truth, Mr. Foley. - Want a cup of coffee? - I'd prefer to have a drink of that whiskey? It's over there. I'm really sorry that I have been tracking up your nice floor. That's bad news, Bobby Jay. I'm sorry to hear that. Now sir, you did say he was trouble. But that order of yours about not shooting... Mr. Foley, I lost my two best friends because of that order. Why don't you go on over to the hotel, get a hot bath and some sleep. We'll settle this later. From now on, I'll take care of Clay Lomax. If it's all the same to you, sir, I prefer my money now. All right. Why didn't you want him shot? - Why? You? - Yeah, by me. I've killed men before, Mr. Foley, no complaints. So I've heard. So has everybody heard it from you. When you buy a killing, Bobby Jay, you sell yourself. A reliable professional killer is a closed mouth. Me, I'm a business man, with a reputation to protect. Understand? Oh no, sir. That's putting it real nice. I mean I know my place. - What are you gonna do when Lomax gets here? - I'm gonna ask him to come in and sit down. Give him a drink and cigar and say: Well, Clay, what's on your mind? I loose two men and you'll get Lomax a cigar? A drink and a cigar. Now, here! 100... Two hundred. That's double what I told you. Now get out! What about Pepe and Skeeter? What am I gonna their poor families? I also lost a horse. And a rifle, and a couple of handguns. Who the hell are you? I keep house for Mr. Foley. Is there anyone else to home? Alright. Get over by that window. If anybody gets in, you're gonna get the same thing a your boss got. Get that bag you're carrying and bring it on over here! Having more fun? I like fun too. Much as the next man. But I get less of it. - Here. We split it right down the middle. - Where is Decky? Well... put that gun away and I will tell you. Get over here! Right there. Now I don't see any fancy teacups around, but I do see an apple in that bowl. Get it. Get it! Put it on his head and don't get between us. Did you ever hear of the Switzer name of William Tell? I'm gonna give you a chance. I'm gonna put this gun away. Then I'm gonna draw and I'm gonna shoot that apple off your head. If you think you can stop me, you draw. - She ran off when I was changing horses! - She ran where? - I don't know. Fun?! You had a lot of fun with them kids, didn't you? Put one of them little whiskey glasses on his head. Here is your second chance to draw. Next target... I'm gonna supply the next one myself. You're gonna appreciate this because you like fun so damn much. Ma'am! Now you keep to him one side and balance this cartridge on his head. Take it! I'm gonna make you draw, punk! Because I want to see you the way Trooper saw it. Fun and jokes! And here's the catch: If you don't draw and I hit that cartridge, it's gonna blow your head off. I could miss, that's a lot smaller than a teacup. And you're a lot bigger than a little girl. Oh? What's the matter? Huh? It says it needs some nerve-tonic. You can kill me, but don't stand there mocking me now! Shoot me or give me a chance! Come on, you wanna give me a chance? Are you all right, huh? Are you ready to give him a chance? It says it's ready. Fetch the laws. I see you've finally got a new hat. That's not a Texas hat either. - Oh, what about it? - Oh, nothing. Are you my father? You asked me that before. Are you gonna start that again? Not if you don't want me to. But why did you come back? I'm damned if I know.
