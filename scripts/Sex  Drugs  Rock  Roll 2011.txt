My given name is Dickie, l come from Billericay, and l'm doing. .. .. .very well! # Had a love affair with Nina in the back of my Cortina # A seasoned up hyena could not have been more obscener # She took me to the cleaners and other misdemeanours # But l got right up between her Rum and her Ribena # Well, you ask Joyce and Vicky # lf candy-floss is sticky # l ain't a blinking thicky # l'm Billericay Dickie # And l'm doing very well # l bought a lot of brandy # When l was courting Sandy # Took eight to make her randy # And all l had was shandy # Another thing with Sandy # What often came in handy # Was passing her a mandy # She didn't half go bandy # Well, you ask Joyce and Vicky # lf l ever took the mickey # l ain't a common thicky # l'm Billericay Dickie # And l'm doing very well # l rendezvous with Janet # Quite near the Isle of Thanet # She looked more like a gannet # She wasn't half a prannet # Her mother tried to ban it # Her father helped me plan it "Go on, son" # And when l captured Janet # She bruised her pomegranate # Oh, you ask Joyce and Vicky # lf l ever shaped up tricky Tell him to shut that racket up! # And l'm doing very well! # You should never hold a candle # lf you don't know where it's been # The jackpot is in the handle # On a normal fruit machine # So, you ask Joyce and Vicky # Who's their favourite brickie # l ain't a common thicky # l'm Billericay Dickie # And l'm doing very well # So, you ask Joyce and Vicky # About Billericay Dickie # l ain't a fucking thicky l'm Billericay Dickie # And l'm doing very well # One, two, one. .. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, hold on, hold on. -Your timing's off, mate. -Well, you're out of tune. This ain't jazz. Learn to play drums and I'll learn to sing in tune. Let's be nice, lads. How can you tell if a stage is level? 'Cause the drummer dribbles out of both sides of his mouth! -Yeah, very bleedin' funny. -Not as funny as this, mate. -You're fucking fired! -What? -Oh, not again! Oh, yes! -Oh, I'll take the equipment, then. -All right. Your body odour smells like a fucking orang-utan on heat. You smell like your mother's cock and balls. Two fucking cymbals, mate. -Come on, then. Who wants him out? I've just given birth. Any chance you could keep the noise down? Oh! It's a boy. You are so clever. I'll be in the kitchen, all right? Now look what you done. We're all on our own now, son. Now listen, you monkeys. Stories are what we tell ourselves to make ourselves feel better about ourselves. So, never let the truth get in the way of a good story. Once upon a time, in a mystical land far, far away, weIl, Southend-on-Sea, a young prince holidayed. His name was lan Dury. He was handsome, healthy, highly intelligent. And brilliant at swimming. Oh! Look at me. Weren't l a lovely little chap? But in the pool, evil lurked. lts name was polio. A water-borne contamination. A virus, and when it gets into your system, you've had it. Pay attention, chaps! The polio virus, a.k.a. the crippler. lt attacks the nervous system here, here and here. Makes you bloody nervous 'cause it can bloody well kill you! It infIames the brainstem, fucks with the spinal cord, leading to paralysis and muscular wasting. Lock up your children. No one is safe! A monstrous epidemic. Daddy! Bloody hell. It's the Muppets! We are the band. You've got to be joking? We was going to call ourselves Cripple, Nigger, Yid, Chink and Dead Fish, but we didn't get any bookings. Could you direct us to the artistes' dressing rooms? Oh, you are so gonna miss all of this. When we've made our millions and we're playing Hammersmith Odeon.. . Why, don't they have three inches of piss in the dressing rooms? Nah, it's all shag pile carpets and extraordinary acoustics. # For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow.. . # Oi. Did you hear the one about the dyslexic pimp who set up a warehouse? Go on, my son! # And so say all of us # Yay! Is Dad coming? Hey, what do you call a man with paper trousers? Russell. Hope you don't mind me saying so, Russell, but you are being a rather miserable old cunt. What do you think we should spend our money on? I don't know. Birthday presents? Birthday hats? Birthday cards? Hey, everyone! Let's give him the bumps! Let's give him the bumps! Well, l'd just like to say that you've been a monumentally atrocious audience tonight, apart from the faithful few at the front, it's the worst gig.. . Yes, a big hand for you lot. lt's the worst gig we've ever played since Sidcup Crematorium. But we'd like to finish anyway with a song called Blackmail Man. - One! Two! - One, two. One, two, three, four! Three! Four! # l'm an lrish cripple, a Scottish Jew l'm the blackmail man # A raspberry ripple, a buckle my shoe l'm the blackmail man # A silvery spoon, a bubble and squeak # l'm the blackmail man # Well, l'm the blackmail man and l know what you do, every one of you # l'm the blackmail man # You make me sick, make me Tom and Dick # Blackmail man, blackmail man I wouldn't have booked 'em if I'd known. What a load of shite. Can't hold a tune. Come on, Russell, get it right, you doughnut. - You're fucking shit! Get off! - Fuck off! Russ! Where are you going? Russell, wait. Wait! # Fraser and Nash pony and trap # Up your 'arris, in your mince # Hamptons don't leave fingerprints l'm the blackmail man Call that singing? You're shit. Fuck off! I'm more of an Emerson, Lake and Palmer man myself. I thought you were fucking great. Really? Great as in celebrated, illustrious, famous? Or great as in large, fat, bloated? Something you do to a nutmeg, perhaps? Great as in great! And I should know. I saw Jimi Hendrix before anyone. -Really? -Mmm-hmm. Tell me. Was Jimi. ..nice? Yeah. He was extremely polite. So, do you always wear those glasses? For your protection, my dear. I am very, very good with women. I used to live with me mum and her two sisters. I like women so much, I used to think I was a repressed homosexual. But I'm not. Fortuitously, I am gorgeous to look at. Can I tickle your tonsils, please, miss? -Maybe. -Mmm. You have to be extremely polite. Oi, sling your hook. Just pay up what was agreed. I didn't agree to a bunch of spazzers from the mental home. You see, that's just not a very spiritual thing to say! Well, have a look at your drummer! What's the problem? He can't leave the stage at the interval. So? Well, it don't happen to fuckin' Pink Floyd, does it? And as for Long John Silver.. . Oi, mate, you puttin' it on? You didn't limp like that on stage. Oh, no. On stage I try to hover. Look, I'm sure we can come to some friendly agreement. Yeah, we can agree you can't sing, you're past it and you look like a Potato Jesus. -No offence. -None taken, you fat-ankled fucker. Fat ankles? I might be a fucking cripple, mate, but I'm dangerous, all right? You wanna sort out your inner calm. Nice one, Davey, go on. Go on, my son, get in there! Russell. Russ, we need to talk about this. There you are. There's your millions. Joke money, joke life. It's over, mate. We're going nowhere. Russ, why you got to say things like that? I quit. Nobody quits. Quitting is not in the vocabulary. Yeah? What about "Fuck you, Ian"? Is that in the vocabulary? -What did you say? -Nothing. Go on, then. Go on. I don't fucking need you. What do you mean? I write the music, I drive the van. I carry you up the stairs when you're pissed. I make the fucking sandwiches. Can you drive? Yeah, see, she can drive. And I bet she can make fucking sandwiches and all. Russell, come on. Look, we're talking, mate. We're trying to talk! Russell! Right, you're fucking fired. You are, you're fired. You didn't quit, you were fired! -Yes? Do I know you? -No. Well, do us a favour and fuck off, will you? Hey, Ian, you know that geezer's a keys player. -That's not very polite, is it? It's like being back at school. -Are you a groupie? -No, musician. -What do you play? -Oi. Sorry about that. Where you think you're going, you little monkey? That was out of order back there. It's the drink, you know, so. .. It's like bad breath for the mind. Someone said that you play keyboards. Yeah. I play a little piano and guitar. Oh, wow. Well, we don't have any little ones, only the big sort. -What's your name? -Chaz. -Chaz. -Chaz Jankel. Chaz Jankel? Very avant-garde. Tell you what. Why don't you come over tomorrow, hey? After all, you know what they say. "The more interesting a man, the greyer his trousers." But they also say, "You're never alone with schizophrenia." So what the fuck do they know? But it's true, we are alI on our own, aren't we? Oh, no, you're not! - Oh, yes, l am! - Oh, no, you're not! The young prince was. He was gonna die. Death was his bedfellow. Some whispered, "Oh, it might be better after all. "l mean, what sort of quality of life?" A cripple? A raspberry ripple? But in the morning, he was still there! You see, it's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog! Magnificent! TroubIe is, there's no cure for it. Just like love. There's no cure for that, neither. Oi! Oi! Daddy's home! Your dad's here. And now, then, let's see what the old clot has got. For you, Jemima darling.. . Boing! And for you, my son. .. For your birthday. Better late than never. So powerful no man could stop him. Rubbish. Don't make me angry. You won't like it when I'm angry! Dr Banner, you're changing! But with pain comes power! Hulk is strong! . ..he doesn't need you turning up out of the blue bringing gifts. He needs a father! He's got a father. I'm his father. He needs a father who's around! I'm around! I mean, well, I come around. I was here when he was born, wasn't I? Just downstairs, I mean, not a lot of fathers can say that! Found a couple that survived. There's only two left. He's been missing school. And stealing. Well, that's all right. All boys do that. It's a boy thing, isn't it? A packet of fags, dirty magazine. In fact, it's good. A sign of intelligence. Shows a sensitivity about the world. -And he's being bullied. -By who? I told him not to retaliate. You don't wanna do that. He wants to give 'em a bloody good smacking. Yeah, well, that's why he needs to come and stay with you for a while. No, no, no. He needs you at the moment. Look, I'm on the verge of something, things are happening. I've been offered some work at the Academy. Good. One of us needs to earn and I can't do it stuck out here in the country. I've always encouraged you, Ian. Now it's your turn. -Is Dad gone? -Left about an hour ago. Looks all right. Blimey! How many more steps? I'm not Sherpa bloody Tenzing. It's Oval Mansions. We get to live in a mansion together. Catshit Mansions more like. All right. What colour for the walls? Would you say white? Nah, that's too institutional. -Blue, then? -No, too constitutional. It should be. ..claret. Yeah. Yeah, the colour of blood. Passion. And a sort of booze. -You up for it? -Mmm-hmm. I. .. I can do anything. If you teach me. What's wrong? We're going to have to switch places 'cause I'm struggling to undo your buttons here with my dodgy left hand. Or you can do it, I don't mind. # l come awake # With a gift for womankind # You're still asleep # But the gift don't seem to mind # Rise on this occasion Not too bad. Have you done this before? # Halfway up your back # Sliding down your body # Touching your behind # You look so self-possessed Aw! # l won't disturb your rest # lt's lovely when you're sleeping # But wide awake is best # Wake up and make love with me # Wake up and make love # Wake up and make love with me # l don't want to make you # l'll let the fancy take you # And you'll wake up and make love # You come awake # ln a horny morning mood # And have a proper wriggle # ln the naughty naked nude # Roll against my body # Get me where you want me # What happens next is private What are you doing? This is Denise. -Hello, Denise. -That's Baxter. Hello, Baxter. Your door's unlocked. Mum's putting the kettle on. Nice. Go on then, off you pop. Thanks so much for this. So kind. -Takes quite a lot to make a home. -Yeah. "Home is the place, no matter what you've done, they have to let you in." That's what Ian says. -So you're a bass player? -Bass player, sandwich-maker, personal manager. Sole driver of a van full of nutters. We're looking forward to having Baxter stay. Any time you need help we're here. Yeah, um.. . He's a little fussy, he doesn't like tomatoes, -fruit of any kind, potatoes. .. -Like father like son, eh? -How old are you, Denise? -I'm almost 20. Oh! -I'm sorry about that. -It was always heavy for me, too. Is that Elvis Presley? Don't they teach you any classical history at school these days? That's Gene Vincent. Scramble-egged his leg in a bike accident. Him and Eddie Cochran were the brightest stars in the firmament when they climbed into a cab outside the Savoy, April 1 6th, 1 960. Two hours later, they hit a hairpin bend. Crash! Eddie Cochran is lying dying in his own blood. And who hands Sweet Gene his guitar that night outside the hotel? A 1 4-year-old Marc Bolan, who marries Pink Floyd's management secretary, who signs me to Stiff Records. Shake my hand. You're only five steps away from greatness. -Stiff? -Stiff, yeah. Their motto is "If it ain't Stiff, it ain't worth a fuck!" How's school? Headmistress is a bit of a stuck-up old cow. Oi, language, bit of respect. Education's important. Delacroix, French, Frenchman he was, painter, he said, "Inspiration is getting to our studies at 9 a.m." Go on, hit it. You know what I'm talking about, you barely said two words to the woman. -You can't treat people like that. -Don't give me that load of old bollock. Bet and I have got a special relationship. Exactly, she's your wife. Yeah, based on love and trust and understanding. What, and taking the piss? You were really fucking rude, Ian. It was the past, all right? It's a separate existence. Anyway, I asked you to marry me, you keep saying no. This isn't a joke. You've got children. You are never gonna be separate. Do you understand that? Excuse me, I'm trying to sleep. # My old man was fairly handsome # Later on he drove a Roller # Chauffeuring for foreign men Daddy! # Perhaps he had to keep his distance # My old man was fairly handsome You all right, boy? Come on. Boxers always touch themselves on the side of the face to remind them to keep their guard up. That's it. Move your feet, come on. Move your feet, move about. That's it. Keep moving about. You're too square on. Move around the side. Good, orthodox, lovely. All them southpaws should be buried at birth. Where are you going? That's it, stand up. All right. Now move about, on the balls of your feet if you can. That's it. Plenty of that. Plenty of leg movement. When you're ready, I want you to take a swing at me. All right? Give me your best shot. Come on. All the best, mate, from your son. Turtle! Turtle! Turtle! Turtle! What's all this? You have to get up on your own. That's the rule here, isn't it, children? Yes, Mr Hargreaves. I'm not staying here. My daddy's coming to take me away. Oh, your daddy, eh? Good for you. Shape up. You got to be brave, all right? No one's taking liberties with you, boy. Give me your best shot, come on. All right? No, you gotta stand on your own. All right. All right. Well done, son. You did good. But no one out there is gonna help you. Now that's seems harsh, I know, but you're born on your own, you die on your own. And in between, you earn your own respect. Never give up, never. And never step into a dead man's shoes. You know what that means? It means you gotta do it for yourself. Being the underdog with nothing to lose is the best place to start. l'm doing pretty good at the moment, you know. Yeah? I got one or two proper deals on the go. Money owed. I got a nice penthouse in Old Victoria, I'm happy with me digs. You should come and see me. Would you like that? Would you? Yeah, I'd like that. # My old man # Dad? Dad? -What time is it? -Lunchtime. -Is that your mum? -It's the school on the phone. It's the headmistress. Hello? Hello? Hello? This is Baxter's headmistress. ls that Mr Dury? Yes. Mr Dury speaking. Yes. Are you aware that Baxter had school today? -Mmm-hmm. -Do you understand? Yeah. No, no, I do understand, yes. Yeah, of course. l'm sure l don't need to tell you how important it is.. . Yeah, no, I do understand, yes. Yes. Okey dokey, yes. Well, it's all very well saying you understand, but this is your son's future we're talking about. Mmm-hmm. -Your wife told me about.. . -Mmm-hmm. Well.. . And l want you to know that l'm not. .. You know what? He was right. You are a bit of a stuck-up old cow. -l beg your pardon? How dare you? -Tiddley poo, madam. Snotty old maggot, she is. Put on the kettle, will you? Ta. -Where's Denise? -She's gone out. You're gonna have to help me put me leg on, then. Right, if you could. .. Come here. Let me swing round, I'll put my arm round you. After three. One, two, three. That's it. See me new leg? Look at that. Phwoar. Been waiting for that for ages. Beautiful. You do that one, I'll do this one. Get this underneath. I'm still getting used to it myself, actually. See what your old man has to go through every day? What a palaver. Dear Jemima, l've been working with a man called Chaz. If we do weIl, we wilI have disgusting ice cream. lf we don't, we will cry. Boo-hoo! l can't wait for you to meet Denise. You should come up and visit sometime. Baxter's turning into a right little geezer. Always keep a strong heart in case of sadness. Love, your charming father, Dad, Nebbish, Clot. I'm going to disagree with Nigel. The real shock here is the whole Sex Pistols swearing on television, Bill Grundy being sacked, it all turning into some sort of moral panic. l mean, these boys are the future. They're the voice of a young generation. Fucking Sex Pistols. Bollocks. And he nicked my razorblade-earring idea and all, didn't he? Turn it off, Den, will you? l'm sorry, Nigel, l'm sorry. If you get bitter, you have a strong heart. Remember? Never let it be said that my failure went to me head. "Swearing on the television "is not funny and not fucking clever!" Language. First words my sister ever said were, "Fuck off, Dad." Must be inherited. Does she sack drummers, too? Incredible Hulk doesn't swear, does he? -He's got a moral compass. -That's right. Moral compass? I'm an entertainer, not Christopher bleeding Columbus. Oi, what do you think of that? Nah, that's too, uh, too romantic. Here you go. Is that all? It's been a slow week. -Ian? Uh, too satanic. Oi, oi, what's wrong with that one? -You're always giving me that one. -Yeah, and? We know all about that, Ian. Oh, no, no, Chaz, Chaz, Chaz. That, that is a riddle. It's a love song. It's a questioning. It's a striving of the human soul. It's just.. . It's called Sex, Drugs & Rock & Roll. That's good. -Mmm-mmm, it's too obvious. Tell him, Denny. Look, it's a celebration. It's. .. It's an anthem for all the outsiders, for all the uglies, for all the freaks, you know, who are slaving away every day in their shit shirts and their shit shoes, trying to fit in. "Is that all there is to life?" they ask. And then, lo and behold.. . -Can you dance to that, Denny? -Yeah, if you dance with me. You nicked that. God, everyone's a critic these days, aren't they? The immature artist plagiarises and the mature artist steals. And I am about to grow up. Sex, drugs and rock and roll. Okay, how about.. . See? Blue's your colour, you know that? That's it. That's it. # Grey is such a pity Yeah! Look at you all! Look, look. -You're magnificent! You are gonna be -just like your dad. -No, no. -A proper little geezer. -No. -Baxter, come on. -Don't. Baxter, stop fidgeting. -Bax. .. Stop it. -Don't be such a baby. -Get off. Who did that? Boys. Bigger boys. They said I was posh. Are we posh? No, we're arts and crafts. That's what we are. We're arts and crafts. There. That's handsome, isn't it? Baxter! There he is, here's my son. These are all my friends. Say hi to Baxter, everybody. Big round of applause for my son. Baxter Front, I like to call him. Listen, we haven't tried this one before. It's a little experimentation. Oi, Chaz, let's start this up. We'll go for the rock. We'll have white face, black shirt, white socks. One, two, three, four. # Who, who, who slapped John? # White face, black shirt # White socks, black shoes # Black hair, white Strat, bled white, died black # Sweet Gene Vincent # There's one in every town # And the devil drives # Till the hearse arrives # And you lay that pistol down Just keep singing that last verse. # Sweet Gene Vincent # There's one in every town # And the devil drives till the hearse.. . Keep singing! # Sweet Gene Vincent I hope you don't mind me saying, but you are being a bit of a right old moody. We said we'd look after him, Ian. Yeah, I know. He's my son. -I've got him a driver and everything. -What, someone reliable? Yeah, yeah, of course. -Really? -I mean, the man was a roadie with Led zeppelin, for fuck's sake. All right, Baxter? I've got a little surprise for you. Ooh, speak of the devil, and he will appear. Can you feel him slouching ever nearer? Ooh, has Santa Claus come early this year? No.. . It's the Sulphate Strangler! # The sons of the prophet were brave men and bold # And quite unaccustomed to fear # But the bravest by far in the ranks of the Shah # Was Abdulla Bulbul Ameer # One day, this bold Russian # He shouldered his gun # And donned his most truculent sneer # Downtown he did go, where he trod on the toe # Of Abdulla Bulbul Ameer -Watch it! -Oh, shit! Oh, sorry. Lovely. You all right, Dad? l'm doing pretty good at the moment, you know. You should come and see me. Would you like that? # The sons of the prophet were brave men and bold # And quite unaccustomed to fear Your mum told your dad to tell me to make sure you went in. Now, go on. I look like a prick. Well, that went well, then. Come on. Did you? -Don't shout at me! I'm not shouting. Who's shouting? Did you or did you not try and sell my typewriter? -How would you know? -'Cause it says in here, "For sale, Ian Dury's fucking typewriter"! All right, I did it. I admit it, all right? -Hello? Ian, we need to work. But you know what, Ian? No one fucking wanted it. I am not your fucking pet, all right? I'm as hungry for this as you are. Oh, boo. The green-eyed monster's coming out, is it? The world doesn't revolve around you! Oh, I think you'll find it fucking does. -How was school? -Okay. -Fuck you! -Feeling left out, are you? -Double fuck you. -Oh, fucking hell, that hurt. Write some lines! I will show more respect! And I'm doing all this fucking work, all this work for the family, right? You and me. You and me, it's for us. Oh, God. You fight like a bloke, Denny. Oh, great. Broke me new leg. Can you help me take it off, please? Ian? Hello? Everything you do is for the family, is it, Ian? -Yeah, yeah. -Right, that's fucking bollocks. Everything you do is for you, on your terms. And if the rest of us happen to fit along, -then that is a fucking bonus. -Is that what you think, is it? -Yeah, that's what I think. -Yeah? Is that what you really think? 'Cause if that's right, well, you better fuck off, then, because do you know what? I can't handle this. I can't handle this. I'm on a flow at the moment, right? I'm right in it. I'm right inside it. And you're getting right inside my brain, when I'm on one, and I won't have it, all right? So if you can't handle it, then fuck off. You think you can do without me, do you, Ian? -Yeah. -Really? Oi. Can I have me leg back? Oi, don't leave me on the floor. I'm a raspberry. Nice throw. Just easy. Got it! Fuck! Fuck! We can rebuild him. He just needs a bit of distance. I'm either too close or not far enough away. Denise, what.. . What happened to him happened a long time ago. There's nothing we can do about it now. Everyone has their weakness. It's just that his weakness is so obvious he doesn't need to worry about it. But what about me? What am I supposed to do? My weakness is loving him. Dad's home. I'm knocking 40. I'm a bit of a shorty. Little bit haughty, a bit nutty, a bit naughty.. . Enough with the rhyming couplets. Look, I will pay front money for the room, proper wedge.

Dreary Dury, the Dancing Durex. -Don't get snotty on me, posh boy. -Leave me alone. Yeah, walk away! Fuck off! Gonna get your Spazzy Joe dad to come and save you? 'Cause guess what? We don't give a shit who he is. -Fucking spaz. -What's his name again? -Captain Cripple the Raspberry Ripple! -Fuck off. Who the fuck do you think you are? You learnt some words, have you? Proper little villain. -All right, Bax? -All right, Strang? You know you've got blood coming out of your nose? "Who awoke the sleeping tiger? "It was thee. "The dormant devil did no harm, "except to me. "The writer sat, scratching his arse, "wishing he wasn't middle class.. ." I've met someone else. What, around here? You wanna be careful. He's Welsh. He does ceramics. Oh, pottery sheep? We should think about getting a divorce. No. No. It would be better for you, better for the kids, better for Denise. That's far too logical. No, Bet, that would be just like tossing everything away. -Don't do this, Ian. -I love you. I know you love me. But you don't need me. There's someone else who needs me. Hello. Welcome home. -I missed you. -Oh, I missed you, too. You have painted. Mmm-hmm. Freshen it up. I thought it was looking a bit jaded. -You don't like it, do you? -I didn't say that. But you don't. It's all very. .. white. Knock-knock. Who's there? We got some great tunes. Now all we need is a band with a drummer I can't sack.

Well, we're all unique, aren't we? Eh? Yeah, but if you wish to package that uniqueness, well, then you take risks. Don't we, Denise? Eh? Even with things in love? Love. Mmm. Well, there are people in this world who act purely out of love. Whereas, me, I'm a wanker being interviewed by a cunt and I love it. Am I making a bit of a kipper of meself, Denny? I think this little squirt wants to know how we're getting on. Well, I'd like to be at home. Oh, would you? Well, this is home. No, this is rented for a small fortune, actually.

It almost did. Count the blessings in the here and now, eh? Tired, Ian. Will you stay? Of course I will. -Okay, everyone. So this is Ian. -Hello. Ian used to be a student here a few years back. And everyone's very excited about you being here, aren't we? Well, thank you very much. It's nice to be here. Ian, I think you said it's okay if people ask you questions. Yeah, go on, pile them in. Don't all rush at once. -Okay, so.. . -Who'll go first? Finished? Is that it? Right. Well, I'm off, then. Oh, I don't know why they got so quiet now. They were really noisy before. Oh, yeah. Cortez, you wanted to talk to Ian, didn't you? -Hello. -He says hello. Oh, hello, mate. Hello. How you going? You all right? What you been up to? Did you always want to be a singer? -Did you always want to be a.. . -Singer. Well, I don't really think of myself as a singer, as it happens, I think of myself as more of an entertainer, really. You know, I always wanted to get up on a stage. Give it all that, you know. I don't know how much longer I can get away with it, really, 'cause I'm a bit of an old chap. Anybody else? -Do you believe in God? -What's that? Do you believe in almighty God who created us in His image? I believe in good, which I think is the same thing. But do you believe in God? Up in heaven? Oh, I used to, but, erm. .. -But not any more. -Why not? Because I think that down here on Earth, I think that's. .. that's where you got to get your nut together. -Typical. -Did you just say "typical"? He's a cheeky little bugger, isn't he? You're gonna help me write a song, okay? You're going to help me with the rhythm, right? Now, rhythm. Who's tricky with rhythm? Eh? Right. Rhythm, I'll have you know, is the longest word in the English dictionary without any vowels in it, right? It's very, very special because you can feel it right here. I'm gonna give you a rhythm, all right? One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Wait for it. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three.. . All right, louder. Everybody louder. Louder! Louder! Go crazy! Go crazy with it! Come on. Louder! I think that went really well. Thank you so much. I had a fight with a guy called Jimmy Coghill behind that tree. Did you really? Did you win? No, he knocked seven tons of shit out of me. There was an orderly here by the name of Hargreaves. Is he still going? I'm sorry, Ian. It was a while ago, but Mr Hargreaves took his own life. He hanged himself up in one of the attics. Yeah, it's very sad. That has made my day, that has. -See you. -Yeah, thanks again. I don't know who you are any more. But you know what I really can't take? It's the hope. The hope that it's gonna get better. It's not, is it? Everything's out of joint. I don't really know if I've got the bollocks to stop it. You've got to get out of here, Denny. Run away. And you got to do it all by yourself. You'll still be my gracious, my family. And if you ever forget that, act sorry for yourself, I'll come back and I'll bleedin' well haunt you. You understand? Hello, it's Graham, from the Spastics Society. We spoke on the phone. "Full participation and equality for all." That's the motto. This United Nations Year of the Disabled is a tremendous opportunity, you know, to make people really sit up and think. Of course, we're going to need all the help we can get, so. .. Wouldn't it be wonderful if you could get back on top again? Maybe you get a new song, maybe another hit single. Who knows? -The UN are very keen. -Are they? I understand you've been dabbling in a spot of acting. Oh, yeah, I've played a few villains in me time. Typecast. Well, here's an opportunity to introduce yourself all over again. You know, a new fan base, new beginnings. Oh, dear. Your friend seems to have gone. Well, look, you seem to be in a spot of trouble. May I give you a lift? Yeah. That'd be great. It's really. .. It's really great to have you back. The prodigal son returns. To be a geezer like me, you got to be a bit of a selfish loony, really. Can't bother too much about day and night and right and wrong and so forth. And occasionally one's behaviour makes one ashamed of oneself. Well, I'm glad to hear it. Anyway, this Year of the Disabled. .. Got a chance now to get back on top. Proper deals going down, so. .. So, what have you got? # When Tessie Trouble's on patrol # And Suzie Sadness makes you blue # When Lennie Love come through the door Well, it's not Sex, Drugs & Rock & Roll, is it? Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Fucking Year of Disabled. I mean, it's like, what? Like, last year we was fine and next year is going to be great, but this year, just this year, oh, we're all gonna be a right bunch of fucking cripples, aren't we, eh? Why don't we just form a band? I know, I know, we can call ourselves Spastic and the Autistics. Oi, oi! You dribblin', wibblin', scribblin', cripplin' little fucking hobblin', wobblin', bobblin' fantastic spastic! I like it. And welcome back. Well, we all like a bit of jazz, don't we? And so, turning to our next item and that's the continuing controversy surrounding the United Nations Year of the Disabled. We're going to hear from lan Drury, the housewife's favourite punk rocker, the man who put the phrase "sex & drugs & rock & roll" into the English language, and whose new song Spasticus Autisticus has been labelled outrageous and offensive. We also have with us Graham Hart from the Spastics Society to talk about full participation in the Year of the Disabled. -Hello, there. -So, turning to you first, Ian Drury. .. First of all, it's not Drury or Dreary or Doory, it's Dury. But I would like to say that, yeah, I think we should all fully participate in holding Graham down and chopping off his tiny little bollocks -for being a spineless little shit. -Right, Ian, thank you. I don't think this is the time or the place. No, it's not the time or the place. You're right. It never is, is it? I'm terribly sorry. Will you excuse me, please? -Bandit! -No, nobody has banned anything. No, you. You're a bandit. You're a chiseller. Well, they don't ban cripples, either, do they, eh? They just make it difficult for them to function. The song is still being played on current affairs programmes. Great! Yeah, that's great! Late at night when all the raspberries are tucked up in bed, oh, not doing any harm to anybody. Yes, well, it was found offensive. How could I go up to somebody, right, who's got the same disabilities as me and be offensive? No, not disabled people so much, no. Well, it wasn't written for you, was it? Eh? The walkie-talkies! It's a war cry type of item, like "Spartacus!" Yes, well, if I remember correctly, Spartacus was crucified. Yeah, I'll be in good company, then, won't I? Look, it was felt that what you've written just isn't very sympathetic. Sympathetic? Life ain't sympathetic, right? I'm not Tiny Tim. I am Ian Dury. People like me do not want sympathy. They want respect. It's a waste. Okay? People felt you had the opportunity to do something remarkable. Your crowning glory, to be remembered after you've long gone. I do not give a shit. I don't care if I'm as popular as a Chinese pig in a synagogue. I am not here to be remembered, I'm here to be alive! So you take your Dis-United Nations, right, and your Year of Dissembling and stick it right up your fucking 'arris. Cunt. Keep your body strong, keep your guard up. Ian, I need a rest. Ow. Clive and I want to be together. We don't wanna rush into that. Look what happened last time. Some blokes turn out to be an absolute nightmare. I want a divorce, Ian. I still love you. It's not about love, silly. It's not your choice. Let me go. Go on, you're fired. Darling. Getting better. You're not gonna shout at me again, are you? You actually been in yet? Oh, easy, tiger. -How's Mum? -She's fine. She's gonna be fine. Look, it's done. We had to let Strangler go, 'cause, well, the dramas backstage were getting better than the actual show. Son, I'm sorry. Close your eyes. Go on. Go on. Close your eyes. Can you feel that? Well, that's my hand. From now until forever, I will always be there. Just above your shoulder. All right? I'll tell you what, though. I've just been offered a part in a film. To play an undernourished villain who wins in the end through love. You could come with. Be my assistant. If you like. -Don't you wanna watch me swim? -Nah. You'll be all right. Just remember, keep your head up, keep kicking, try not to drown. "When a free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life. "A slave loses his pain. "Death is the only freedom a slave knows. "That's why he's not afraid of it. "That's why we'll win. .." Sit properly. -Eat your fish. -No! It's horrible. What did you say? You do as you're told. I said, I ain't eating that, it's fucking horrible!
