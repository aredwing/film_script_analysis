I'm sick ofthat cowyelling at me! I'm getting out ofhere. - Where will you go? - The mainland, anhere. What about Denis? The love ofyour life? He can come with me. I'm not rotting away here! The summer is okay... but the winter is a living hell! Didn'tyou everwant to leave? I never thought about it. Never wanted to move somewhere else? Yes, years ago. To move here and get married. Nightmare! Excuse me. You can do the room now. We'll be out here all morning. Yes, madam. Doyou play... What's "chess" in French? - Chess? - Yes. Doyou play chess? No. Ange! What's wrong? An accident? No. I just wanted to seeyou. That's nice butyou had me worried. Shit, sory. Sure you're okay? Yes, I'm fine. I have to go, we have to finish today. I'm behind. Hlne. Seeyou later. When we wereyour age we had summerjobs. To earn some money. My English teacher recommended this course. So what? Your mom and I work like slaves. I don't want to be likeyou! - Like what? - Poor! - Is it shameful? - It's nothing to be proud o Has she ever gone without? No! Calm down. You know she doesn't mean it. Two building contracts were canceled. Thiery may cut workers. The people who earn money aren't spending it anymore. How will we manage? We'll see. Did you askyourYankee for a raise? - How much is this trip to England? - 400 euros. Shit. We'll have to tighten our belts. I'm meetingJacky, we have a game to finish. Don't wait up for me. And he doesn't do anything. Nothing seems to interest him. Lfyou ask him what he wants to do... you know what he answers? "I want to be famous!" Doctor Krger? That man's impossible! Does he giveyou a hard time too? He's all right. Lucky all my patients aren't like him! Have a nice day. Good-bye. Hello, Doctor Krger. Please... ty not to move eveything. I can't find anything afteryou've been here. I'm sory. All right. Do my room first. I wanted to ask... It's about my... - Aboutyour? - Salay. My husband thinks... Does he think foryou? No, I think so too... You could give me a raise. Thankyou. Seeyou soon. One, two, three! Congratulations! Happy birthday! - Cut the cake! - Right. Candles! - Here. - Happy birthday. Birthday presents! An electronic chess set. So I see. What's it for? Playing chess, I'd say! - But I can't play. - You can learn. They say it improves the mind! Vey funny. Can you play? No. Okay! It's a change from backgammon. Who am I supposed to playwith? I don't know. With me? Or on your own. It's a game you can play on your own. On my own? Tiny computer big brain! Come on, let's have some cake. Pass your plates. Why did you do it? Thanks, Hlne. - I hope it didn't cost too much? - No. Champagne! - And champagne glasses! - Right! Where's the cork? The cork for luck! - It went well, huh? - Veywell. Getting up in the morning will be tough. Good night, love. The knight... The rook... The pawn... The king... "One element that makes chess so rich... is the different movements ofall the pieces. The queen is the most powerful piece." The queen is the most powerful piece... Got eveything? I'm not going to Mars! Here. Take it. You never know. - Thanks. Areyou sure? - Yes. Lisa! You'll miss your boat! Coming! - Be careful. - I'm not a child! That's what worries me! - Come for a drink? - Not today. You never come over now. I don't have time. Bye. It's you! Yes, it's me. Areyou okay? Yes. - What wereyou doing? - Nothing. Smoking again? A bit. Call that a bit? It helps me. - Helps you do what? - Think. Think about what? I haven't cooked. I thought we could go out for once. On me. I'm meetingJacky, let's heat up a pizza. I want to go out. Please. All right, get changed. But it's on me. We haven't been to Maddy's for ages. So I kept my head down and... went back to workwithout a word. It's evey man for himselfnow. When three people are fired we're angy, but we're glad it's them... and not us. Maybe Lisa's right. We've turned into sheep. But do we have a choice? In my dad's day they all stuck together. The guys met up evey Sunday. Mom made doughnuts. They drank, sang and changed the world! It was fun. Lftimes got hard we resisted. What wereyou saying? Me? We haven't talked like that for ages. - Doyou know what I'd like? - Yes! No, I'd like to... - Is that whatyou want? - Yes. Really? What's the object ofthe game? The object ofthe game? You have to capture your opponent's king. And checkmate him. And...? And what? - Is that all? - Yes. So all the pieces move differently? Except the pawns, they move the same way. This is the bishop, we each have two. They move diagonally, like this. This is the rook. The rook goes straight ahead... or sideways ifthere's a place. The queen. The most important piece. She can do anything, go anhere she likes. She's stronger than the king. Crazy, right? There. Got it? Sure. You think I'm an idiot? Okay, I'll begin. White always starts. Your turn. No, the knight does this. - The bishop moves sideways. - You never said that! Yes, I did! I t doesn't make sense! I've had enough. Let's go to bed. One last game. I didn't wakeyou? I'm sory. - Snooping through my things? - What? No, I... Put it backwhereyou found it. And stop saying sory all the time. It's a sign ofweakness. Doyou play? Do I play chess? - I do. - You? I have an electronic set at home. I learn at night. And sleep in the day. Will you playwith me? I beg your pardon? I'm not advancing on my own. Why chess? Why me? I don't know who else to ask. Ty playing Patience. Please. Look... - What's your name? - Hlne. Hlne, right. I don't like being bothered. I can do the cleaning for free, ifyou like. You're appealing to my better nature. Tuesday, 4:OO p.m. But let's make this clear: We'll ty it once. Only once. Understand? What areyou doing? I'm coming! Come and see. Come and see. - Knowwhy room 11 is offlimits? - No. She had a wild affair in that room threeyears ago. With an Italian guest. He promised to come back. She goes in there evey day. Pilgrimage! Doyou believe it? She gets a monthly letter from Rome. Denis told me. Natalia, take the sheets... to the laundy, it's your turn today. Four rooms must be ready by midday. Can I count on you? "Yes, Madam, vey good, Madam!" Don't exaggerate. She's not bad at heart. Sure! You always sayyes. We have one hour. Doyou intend to spend it standing up? White opens. Your move. Checkmate. Well? Well what? Will you teach me? Why does this game mean so much toyou? I don't know. We'll start again. See you Tuesday. And smile occasionally. It suits you better than looking serious. All right. "Deve1oping the queen ear1y on is not advisable. It helps... the enemy pieces to deve1op... and they can quicken the pace by attacking her. It's vital... not to waste time right from the start... soyour development is not delayed." Doyou look at eveyone like that? Like what? As ifyour life depends on what they're going to say. Rules are less important than exceptions in chess. Breaking rules at a timely moment: That's whatyou have to do. Doyou understand? Not really, no. Neither do I. Shall we continue? Hlne! Haveyou seen the time? We won't go into that today. Imagine, our Natalia... has been short-listed for her competition! Really? Well done! Well, I haven't won yet. We're 200, they only pick 1 O. Ifl get in I do a ritzy training course on the mainland... and I'll kiss... all this good-bye! She's going to Marseille for 2 days for the oral... and I have no one to replace her. Can you work 2 afternoons next week? - When? - Tuesday and Wednesday. No. No? I can't do Tuesday. I'm sorr... I'm not free. It's me. Hello. Shall I start with... What? You want to do the cleaning? It's done. - Butyou pay me to do it. - No. I payyou to do what I tell you. Come on. Fifteen minutes. And today... I open. E4, c5. Sweetheart! You look lovely. Where wereyou? We were worried! I was at Krger's. I missed my bus. His place must be clean! Forgotten your daughter? Don't fight the day I get back! You're right. We're going home. Ty and find time to come over. We have to talk. Okay. Seeyou later. Bye. We went to London for the day. And we ran out ofthe museum, just the two ofus. It was awesome. And he raped me three times. Who? Okay. I tell you I've fallen in love for real... you don't even listen! I do! It's Antoine, isn't it? You slept with him? You say I've changed, butyou've changed. I'm not hungy. Let's go! The ends, as usual? No, I'd like some little strands. You know? All over. But theywon't be the same length. I don't want them the same length. Theywon't stay in a chignon. I know. You can tell me, you know. Tell you what? You and Doctor Krger. Look straight! - Eveyone's talking. - About what? You don't go over there just to clean. Be careful, Hlne. He's a strange man. When his wife died there were rumors... Nothing was ever proved. But he didn't want to see anyone afterwards. Don'tyou remember? No. Checkmate! Checkmate, you're right. - Well done. - Thankyou. It's late. You should be home by now. Yes. Anay, I missed the last bus. Shall we have a drink? Won'tyour husband say anything? Yes. What's he like? Ange? He's... handsome. - Handsome? - Yes. Really handsome. So many books. Too many. Haveyou read them all? Most ofthem. Doyou like reading? I don't know, I never read. "Martin Eden." Take it. You'll like it. All right? I have to go to the bathroom. Well... O On. Yourwife was beautiful. Vey. Did you play chess with her too? No. It's not true what they say? Thatyou helped her die? Did they tell you that? And you believed it? No. You've changed your hair. I have to go now. - Seeyou Tuesday? - Yes. You all right? What did you eat? Pasta. It's all we could find. - Enjoyyourself? - What? You sail in, it's nearly midnight. Happy and pretty, did you enjoyyourself? Haveyou been drinking? No. Yes. I couldn't get drunk. I'll make some coffee. They all sayyou're two-timing me. It's tough but I don't care. You know it's not true. What I saw today is worse. What did you see? You and Krger. You followed me? He pays you, at least? What doyou mean? I'm tying to understand. Don't bother! Soyou had pasta for supper? It didn't kill you! Can't I have something ofmy own for once? It's not a crime! Come in. You wanted to see me? Sit down. What's been going on? Two weeks ago... the Belgian couple complained... thatyou hadn't changed the towels for two days. Yesterday... the guest in room 9 sent for me to see how badly his bed was made. Then this morning room 12 said you were rude... when he asked you for mineral water. What's wrong? I'm a maid, not a waitress. You're what I payyou to be. Lfthejob isn't good enough foryou... lots ofpeople out there would snap it up. I run this place alone. I can't accept sloppiness. All right. Lisa? - What's wrong... - Leave me alone. Tell me about it. It's Antoine, isn't it? Has he hurtyou? He wants us to break up. Why? He's with someone else. Didn't he tell you? Yes. But he thought it was over. Then when he got back he saw her again. Oh, my darling. I can see his point. Why should he be with a working class girl? What doyou mean? Antoine is middle class! His girlfriend is middle class. You know something? I'm glad it's over. I couldn't have brought him here. It's too tacky! Stop it. I never told him you're a cleaner. I don't want to end up likeyou! Lisa, go to bed. You both disgust me! You're right. I ruin eveything. Don't. Don't. No, I'm not sick. I'm not coming over anymore. I've decided... I'm not playing chess anymore. Because it's impossible. It's too complicated. I'm not coming over anymore. Not even for the cleaning. Good-bye. Hello, Jacky. Hi. "The real world was that ofhis mind... and the stories he wrote the only possible reality." I found this in your room. Haveyou read it? It made me cy. Beautiful. The sailorwho became a writer. You mean the writer who should have stayed a sailor. Why doyou say that? Because he's unhappy. Because he realizes it wasn't worth the effort. And he doesn't belong anhere. Yes, but he did it. Lfhe's an outsider, it's because he's better than those he tried to impress. Why be better ifyou don't do anything with it? It must have been hard when you moved here. Yes, a bit. I'd left eveything, no friends. I spent my time waiting foryour father. No more chess? That's silly! Why not? It's not a women's game. That annoys me. Like men are smarter than us! The most powerful piece is the queen, right? How doyou know? I just know. Show me howyou danced with your friend Ouidad. Come on, Mom! Lfyou've come here to clean... takeyour flowers and go. I've found someone else. Shall we start? What doyou mean? Let's play. I'll be white? I betyou've been practicing on your own. Come on! I can't wait forever! Is this whatyou came back for? Ofcourse. What else? Shall we play blitz? Want to know something? What? I didn't miss you but I'm glad you're here. I didn't miss you either. Hey! What's going on? I thought I'd cook the chicken. Disaster! - Can I help? - No, let me. I'll do it. I have to talk toyou. I have to talk toyou too. Oh yes? What about? I've been thinking. You're right. This can't go on. What? I want to seeyou happy. It was my present, right? You can't throw it away. Lisa will be back soon. Checkmate in 2 moves. Five times running. I give up. It'sjust luck, that's all. Luck has nothing to do with it, as we both know. You know... I think the time has come. The time forwhat? You have to spread yourwings. I've been thinking about it for a while. A tournament. Me? A little tournament. Not the world championship. Notyet. You're tired ofme? I didn't say that. But I like playing with you. How can you say that? You've never played with anyone else. Admityou're scared, you feel safe here. That's not true! Anay, I'm not ready. Ofcourse you're ready. And the next tournament is in 2 months... it gives us some time. Don't imagineyou can get rid ofme like that! You could have told me. We made it clear. Play here or at Krger's but don't look like a fool in public! Whywould she? Know what people call you? "The chess case". I don't care. You don't care ifl look like a fool? You should be proud ofher... instead ofmaking our lives hell! You know something? I admire Mom. Not many people could do it. She has to start training. Sleep a lot, eat well. So she'll be in top form. It's not a sport. Yes, it is! And first prize is 1500 euros. Sinceyou're both ganging up on me! It's a shame I can only take one at a time. Vey funny. Why areyou doing that? Seeyour plan through. But it's lousy. Better to play a lousy plan logically... than no plan at all. It's too tough. It's work. No, it's not. Work is when I do cleaning. Here I understand less and less. - That's part ofit. - Ofwhat? The work. What doyou know? You lockyourselfup with your books. Is that work? It's a luxuy. I t saves me from rubbing shoulders with idiots. It's easy to despise eveyone. Not eveyone. I liked it better before. Before what? When I didn't question anything. How vey inspiring! - Thereyou are. You all right? - Fine. "Natalia, you've forgotten the towels. You have to knock some sense intoyour head!" I better stop laughing at her, I'm not going anhere. I flunked the oral. I totally messed up. I was scared stiff. You can ty for it again. I could but... I was dreaming too big. Denis wants us to get married now and have kids. Four! That's what matters. A husband you love, a family, a quiet life. - Right? - Yes. We better go! I still have rooms 12 and 9 to do. Yes, me too. Come in. Just a minute. I'll see to that. We'll settle it next week, okay? Yes? It's about the tournament. I want to enter. - Doyou belong to a club? - No. Haveyou played for long? No, not vey. Areyou rated? Rated? Although it's an amateur tournament the standards are vey high. Doctor Krger sent me, he's written toyou. Krger? A friend ofyours? Yes... Please sit down. You're his cleaning lady? Yes, why? No reason. - Is that all he says? - Pretty much. Should he have said anything else? He's always done what he likes with people. Would you have time to work for me? Mywife needs someone. Two afternoons a week, ifit's possible? I'll have to see. Is something wrong today? No, eveything's fine. It doesn't look like it. Aren'tyou playing? No. I do the cleaning. After all, I am your cleaning lady. As you said in your letter. So that's it? You played with me like a puppet. I may not be educated, but I have my pride. I'm notyour plaything. You're right. You're not my plaything. I'm sory. I should never have written that. But it's the truth too: You are my cleaning lady. What areyou doing? I'm leaving. I want my money. I hateyou. Stay. I want to showyou something. You see those pictures? Mywife painted them. She was talented, wasn't she? Extremely talented. But she never believed in herself. When she died I thought... I should have encouraged her more. I thought I could have saved her. But that'sjust vanity again. No one can save anyone else. Her doubt was stronger than her painting. Doyou understand? You hurt me. Yes. You are really talented, Hlne. You have... that thing that can't be taught... at school or in books... money can't buy it... many people search for it without ever finding it. Myselfincluded. Will you come to the tournament? Go away. Areyou all right? Leave. Go! Black hit the game clock. Good luck eveybody! Rook... Move your rook... from c8 to c4... He'11 have to trade the pawn. Not that it helps him... asyou'11 take it with the rook. Checkmate. Bravo! - Has she won? - Did she win? She's won! Dad! Dad! What is it? Has she lost? She won four games, she's in the final. What's next? It hasn't started yet. Coming? No. Lfshe sees me it'll throw her. You go. - Keep me posted. - Sure. Good luck eveybody! What's going on? He's late. It's a tactic to destabilize her. That's awful! You ask too many questions. It's on1y a game. So p1ay. Beyourse1fand enjoy it. One bad move... can wipe out Soforce him tos1ip up. And remember: "The threat is a1ways stronger... than the execution." She's won! Sory, I'm late again. It doesn't matter, Natalia. Here's our champion. - Congratulations! - Thankyou. Let's stand in front ofthe hotel. I'm sory, I onlywant the winner. Oh, all right. The winner ofwhat? Hold it. Smile. You're a star now. Not bad. I thoughtyou'd come. I was waiting foryou. Butyou won, didn'tyou? You see... you didn't need me. The next tournament is in Paris. I'm going. It's always been your dream? Well... It will be different. There'll be top players. We'll see. "When you take a risk you may lose... when you don't take a risk you always lose." Right? So I have managed to teach you something. When I get back... we'll start again? You know I hate losing. Then play better! E4... E5... F4... E captures f4... Knight f3... Bishop e7... Knight c3... Bishop h4... Check. King e2... D5... Knight captures d5... Knight f6... Knight captures f6. Check. Queen... captures f6... D4... Bishopj4... Queen d2... Knight c6... C3... Castling queen's side. Go.
