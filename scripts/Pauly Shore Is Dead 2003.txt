And-And the critics-- Pauly, you don't know|what you're talking about. You're great. People love you.|You have a following. - Bio-Dome was a great movie.|- Did you see Jury Duty? - No.|- Neither did anyone else. Did you see Hot Shots.!? [ sighs ]|God, I love that movie. - Yeah, it was pretty good, wasn't it?|- Yeah. My-My point is, Pauly, is that|we've all had our flops. - Mm, some more than others.|- [ sighs ] But...|it'll turn around. Well, how'd you do it? Talent. Good genes. I didn't come up with|some weird animal noise. [ Chittering ] - That's not the point, okay? It's--|- [ knocking ] - [ sighs ]|- Uh-- Look, I gotta|get back to the set. Uh-- Is there a part|in there for me? Charlie, is there a part|in your movie for me? Look, I'll--|I'll talk to the director. I'll see what I can do.|I'll-I'll tell him you're available.

Not for long. - [ Vacuum Cleaner Humming ] - [ Murmuring, Indistinct ] - [ Vacuum Cleaner Continues ]|- [ Continues Murmuring ] [ Exhales ]|Okay. - [ Vacuum Cleaner shuts Off]|- Pablo. Pablo? [ screaming ] Topping the news this evening,|actor-comedian Pauly shore was found dead... in a loft in his mother's|West Hollywood hills home. - Pauly, best known as the Weasel,|started his career on MTV.|- [ Crying ] - [ Man Sobbing ]|- He went on to star in such movies|as Encino Man... - [ sobbing Loudly ]|-Jury Duty and son in Law. Autopsy reports will be ready|in just a few days. Many say he was a genius|who died before his time. - ''Genius''? Genius of what?|- [ Laughs ] We go to the streets now|to get the public's reaction. You know, he tried|to sleep with me once... and tape it. - Me too.|- Did you do it? [ TV..People Wailing, Crying ] Pauly shore,|dead at the age of 29. The kid wasn't fuckin'|wired right. Any fuckin'jackass|could've seen that. [ Woman Reporter]|All of the community is mourning the death... - My son! My son!|- of comedic genius Pauly shore. - An erect penis--|- [ People Wailing, Chattering ] that's what it would appear|to be underneath the sheet. A strange turn of events-- [ Pauly Narrating ] I guess it's true|what they say when you die. You're a lot more loved.|That's probably why I did it. I was so sick of people|coming up to me every day... and ask me|what my next movie was. How was I supposed to explain to my fans|that my shit was tired... and I had pigeon-holed myself|as the Weasel? They don't understand|how Hollywood works. Lenny Bruce,John Belushi|and Sam kinison all went down... as comedic geniuses|who died before their time. And now, me, Pauly Shore. But before the media|blows it out of proportion-- before Access Hollywood|and Jerry springer get ahold of it-- let me tell you the truth|about how I got here. [ Pauly Narrating ] I was born and raised|in Hollywood, California. My dad's a comedian,|and my mom owns a comedy club. And my mom didn't own|just any comedy club. She owned the world-famous|Comedy Store... on the Sunset Strip. The Comedy Store's like|the Emerald City for comedians. Everyone started out there.|Everyone. I remember, one time, my mom|even had Sam kinison babysit for me. [ screeching ]|Ohhhhh! Yeah, thanks, Mom. I guess Charles Manson|was out of your price range. The best part|about my mom, though-- she's been partying|her whole life. Which was great for me, 'cause I was|the first baby born with the munchies. [ No Audible Dialogue ] - Dude, you forgot to flush.|- Dude, I'm flushin' now, man. [ Pauly Narrating ]|Nah, my name's not the Weasel. My name's|Paul Montgomery Shore-- P.M.S. I was just like most kids. I was in Little League.|I had braces. I even modeled. I went to Beverly Hills High School. And I wasn't on the football team.|I was in the dance company. And after I graduated,|I took my acting very seriously. And then it finally happened.|One night in the spring of'89... -my manager got me an audition|for MTVat Mom's club.|-[ Audience Cheering ] - And finally, I became the Weasel. Oh.!|- [ Cheering ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] Cool, buddy. Aw-ooh! My MTVshow led to movies,|HBO specials, strippers and porno stars. - [ Audience Cheering ]|- Hello! Yeah, I was livin'|the American Dream. And then, one day, my so-called|glamorous life came to a screeching halt. [ screams ] I got the most devastating|news ever. No, not genital warts.|Worse. I got a sitcom... on Fox. After that, everything else|got kind ofblurry. - [ TV..Man Grunts ]|- [ TV..Man #2 ] Pauly,|where'd you get all that cash? - I found some loose change in the sofa.|- [ Canned Laughter ] That is one of the perks about being your|best friend-- all that trickle-down cachet. We have to hurry home, 'cause my dad's|got a big surprise waitin' for me. All right, all right. Wow. Check out those girls.|They're scopin' us out. - [ Both Laugh ]|- [ Engine Revving ] - [ Woman ] You must be Pauly.|- And you must be... - my dad's big surprise.|- [ Canned Laughter] - What?|- It's a good thing we're below sea level. Down periscope! Oh! Honey, you gotta get in here.|You gotta see this shit. This is the worst fuckin' show|I've ever seen. - [ Boy ] Now, Dawn is Carol.|- Wait, wait, wait. I wanna beJan... so I can sleep in the same room|with Marsha. Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.|Why does she get everything? [ Ululating ] Oh, my God.|I hate this fucking country. [ Woman ] I have bras|that work harder than you. Yeah, well, your bras|may be workin'... but it looks like your panties|took the day off. - [ All Laughing ]|- Hey, yo! This nigga Pauly|is fuckin' crazy, man! You'd better watch it.|Your father listens to me. I have his ear. That's not the only thing|you have of his. You ever seen Pauly?|And then you see Pauly... on weed? - [ All Laughing ]|- On weed? A lotta weed? Oh, my God! - [ Pauly ] Wow. That's a pretty nice rock.|- [ Woman ] Thanks. It's a four-carat, emerald-cut,|blue-eyed diamond. - [ Canned Laughter ]|- [ Laughing ] [ Singsong ]|Yeah. My mom's was bigger. - Oh! Oh!

I'd also like to thank|my best friend, kirk... who was always there for me|when I was doubting the show's premise. Playing a spoiled rich kid|from Brentwood. I mean, how perfect|is that for me. It's awesome. [ Pauly ]|To our new sitcom.! - [ Pauly ] Whoo.!|- The last time I saw a steaming|piece of shit that big... I was standin' outside the elephant|compound at the fuckin' zoo. - Yeah.!|- [ sighs ] I can't believe the network didn't pull it|after the first commercial break. [ Gags ] I swear-- I swear I'm gonna puke.|You got some Tums or something? I only have a few minutes left.|I'll meet you guys at the club. We'll tell the doorman|you're coming. - Don't be late.|- I won't. I thought Pauly's show|was funny. Oh, yeah. It was, um--|It was hysterical. - Yeah.|- so, what's your name? - Ashley. What's yours?|- Tom. You're that creepy guy|from all those movies, huh? - No. That's Michael Madsen.|- Oh. so, uh,|how you gettin' home? - My mom's picking me up.|- Your mom. - Hmm. How about I take you home?|- Mm. I don't know. Come on.|I'll huff... and I'll puff... - and I'll-- [ Kissing ]|- Okay. - God, that's lame.|- Yeah, of course I want my usual table. What the hell is wrong with you peop--|Just hold it a sec. Pauly, I gotta tell ya, that is the funniest|sitcom I have ever produced. No, it'll run a decade.|Ten years easy. I'll call you in the morning|when I find out what the ratings are. Mitch. Mitch, wait. I just wanna say|thanks for everything. Listen, Pauly, everything we've worked|so hard at in the last eight years... - is comin' together just as planned, buddy.|- Yeah. [ Chuckles ] stinky, bud-dy. I know. stinky piece of shit, bud-dy. Goin' down the toilet, bud-dy.|The fuck that guy does. I'll tell you what he does. He exists.|He lives. He could be incinerated by the heat|from a thousand suns-- it would be too good. The second somebody put a fuckin'|microphone in his hand, and they said... ''Hey, it's okay to talk,'' that's|when the fuckin' trouble began. If my mommy owned a comedy club,|I'd be on fuckin' top, too, motherfucker. - [ Pauly ] Trevorina,you're the|architect to the stars, right?|- [ Woman ] Absolutely. How long do these sitcoms|keep you workin' for? What is it--|five, 1 0, 1 5 years? - [ Phone Ringing ]|- How many episodes did the network order? - six.|- [ Phone Continues Ringing ] Wait. What are you doing?|Give me back my pen. - six episodes?|-Just to start with. They're|gonna order more episodes. - It's your manager.|- Hey. Hey, Mitch. Pauly, you are not|gonna believe this. - Are you sittin' down?|- Yeah. - It was the lowest-rated show in Fox history.|- What? Yeah. It didn't even|break the top 1 00. What about people|in the middle of the country? I don't know. They're pinheads.|I guess they're watchin' Springer reruns. That's okay, that's okay.|'Cause it's the pilot episode. It took seinfeld|a year to catch on. Pauly, uh, brace yourself.|Are you braced? - Yeah, I'm braced.|- They canceled your sitcom. ''Canceled''? -Just like that?|- Hey, come on. Did you read the reviews? - You told me not to.|- Entertainment Monthly gave it an ''F.'' They said, and I quote,|''sucks worse than gravity.'' So they're not even|gonna air episode two?

Look, that's the last thing I'm gonna do|is go crawlin' back to MTV, okay? - Gotta go.|- Don't you hang up on me! -[ Dial Tone ]|-[ Pauly, Screaming ] Fuuuuck.! [ David ] Listen, why don't we take|a drive to Santa Barbara... grab some lunch,|clear the mind. You might be a little shook up|by the news of the sitcom. David, it has nothing|to do with the show, okay? I just-- I just need to surround myself|with a new team. That's all. David? I'm just a little choked-up. - Pauly, are you sure you don't wanna rethink this?|- I already have. Okay, then.|Good luck. - Bye.|- [ Phone Beeps ] Hey, guys. Pauly fired us. He finally fired us!

Then what's|this submoronic crap? [ Man On TV]|I don't think he's happy. Them goddamn|Hollywood know-it-alls. Them numb-nuts wouldn't know|comic genius if it bit 'em in the ass.

I look for another artist|that's got layers to them. And Pauly was, you know--|He was bundled in layers. Pauly was the first person|to bring me to the beach. I never would've got Baywatch|if it wasn't for Pauly. You know, he taught me|how to mouth-to-mouth resuscitate people... and, um, use defibrillators,|things like that. He did have good weed though.|I gotta tell you that. Pauly shore|had fucking good weed. I blazed with him|a couple of times. I smoked his whole sack up, and then|I bounced with his girls and shit, but-- [ Laughing ] At least he was good|for somethin'.

But he always had the nerve|to ask me for shit all over the place. It just-- I felt like smackin' him around|a couple of times, but he's a little guy. Pauly stole everybody's act. He-He would steal the girls.|He'd steal the guys. You should've seen what|he did to my goat, man. For me, Pauly was, like,|a funny guy and whatever.

Like my scream. But enough about me.|Listen, this is what you gotta do. starting tomorrow,|you're going to learn how to act. [ Chuckles ]|You're joking? You're gonna be one of the best actors|that Hollywood's ever seen. [ sniffling ]|What? Look, you've seen the dark side.|You've felt the pain. Welcome to the real world.|I already talked to all your friends. They're gonna help you.|Todd, Lawrence, Pepe-- all of'em. -[ Beeping ]|- Oop. Wait a second. Aw, shit, it's Marilyn.|she wants her dildo back. [ Laughing ] I'll always be|watching out for you, Pauly. I'll always be looking out for you.|Take care. - [ Door Bangs Shut ]|- [ Crying ] Okay. [ Indistinct ] shakespeare. shakespeare.|[ Indistinct ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] This way, Pauly.|?? [ Vocalizing ] Come on. You can do it.|You can do it. Come on, man! [ Reading, Indistinct ] No, no, no. ''O Hamlet,|our dear brother's death''! [ Reading, Indistinct ] - Make it stop!|- [ Continues ] Like this. step out. - Oh, God. Not that. Up here.|- Okay. Okay. Okay. ?? [ Vocalizing ] [ Reading, Indistinct ] I mean, it's getting better, right?|Yeah, okay. ''We should know the way.'' Oh, I can't believe it!|Bravo! There you go.|Now you're getting it, man. There you go now. [ Inmate ]|There you go. [ In spanish ] [ Clears Throat ] Thank you.|Thank you, guys. [ Cheering ] [ Thinking ] I can't believe I did it.|I'm back on top once again. Only this time,|it's within. You know it's weird how|sometimes a bad thing in life... can actually turn out|to be a good thing. All the world's a stage|and men and women are merely players. And one man in his time|plays many parts. At first, the infant.|Then the whining schoolboy. - Then the lover.|- I'm gonna kill you, Weasel! [ screams ]|shit! Fuck! I drove all the way|from Kentucky for this moment. - What's your name?|- Bucky. - Bucky?|- I'm your number one fan, man! Or I-- Or I was. What do you want?|An autograph? A head shot? What? Oh, yeah. Yeah.|An autograph would be real nice. - I'll have it written in your blood.|- [ Whimpering ] I have watched Son in Law|27 0 times. Watched all your MTV specials. Hell, I even sat through|Phantom of the Mall. - You did?|- And I liked it. [ Whimpers ] Well, if you like me so much,|why are you trying to kill me? 'Cause you humiliated me, man. - You fucked with me.|- [ Quietly ] I'm sorry. When I heard that you|was dead... it's like my whole world|had been torn away from me. But then I find out it's all|a joke. All a big, funny, fuckin' ha-ha. Well, I didn't find it too funny. What's all|this shakespeare shit you was doing? You ain't an actor.|You're the Weasel. They weren't going to do|Encino Man 2. No studio was going to|finance son in Law: The sequel. What are you saying to me? You-You tellin' me|the Weasel wasn't real? It's all just a big money-makin' scheme|to some corporation. It's just like Ronald McDonald. You mean Ronald McDonald|ain't really a clown? - No.|- Well, I'm gonna have to kill|that motherfucker too. [ screams ] The Wiez couldn't keep the ratings up|on the Fox show. That's because you weren't|the Wiez! You was some spoiled rich kid from Brentwood,|and that shit ain't funny! - Hell, I even know that.|- Please, don't kill me! Please! [ Crying ]|Please, don't kill me. I'm just--|I'm just Pauly.! [ Panting ] It's okay. It's okay. - I could never hurt you, man.|- [ Breathing Heavily ] Ronald McDonald's|another fucking story. I'll just have to|watch Son in Law... again. Hey, Bucky... thanks for caring. And thanks for being|my number one fan. Make the noise.|Just one more time, please. I wanna act. Okay? Oh, one more thing. No wiezin' the ju-uice. - What movie's that from?|- Encino Man. - say hi toJudge Ito.|- [ Chuckles ] Jury Duty. - Ca-razy, boys.|- In the Army Now. - stub and Doyle! stub and Doyle!|- Bio-Dome.! Bio-Dome.! - Inbreeders.|- [ Whoops ] Son in Law.! - Son in Law.|- [ Whoops ] - [ Chittering ]|- [ Chittering ] You did that just for me. [ softly ]|Thank you. I feel like the last person|that ever heard Elvis sing. [ Distant Gunshots ] - Well, I think I got everything.|- Yep. Richard Gere can have Tibet.|Alanis can have India. But guys like you, me,|Tommy and Downey... we found ourselves|right here in L.A. County, man. - Right. I think Downey should try|one of those foreign places.|- Yeah. I just wanna tell you, Todd,|that I realized a lot of things here in jail. Number one, the Weasel|will always be part of me... just like Willis will always be|a part of you. And number two, all the girls|that I had sex with... they didn't want to have sex|with Paul Montgomery shore... the littleJewish boy|from Beverly Hills. They wanted to fuck|the Weasel. Anyways,|thanks for everything, man. Yeah, but remember, that was your choice.|Hey, next time you see sam... you tell him to tell Redd Fox|to come see me again, okay? - Why?|- Well, that's my guardian angel. - Well, here. Then take him.|- Hey. Thanks, Pauly. - All right, bro.|- All right. Take care, man. - Take care.|- Bye. Always lockin' a brother up. [ Pauly Narrating ] I also realized|that Hollywood isn't such a bad place. In fact, it's probably one of the most|beautiful places in the whole world. People come out here from all over the world|to try and get into show business. Notjust because they love|to sing, dance, act or direct. Everyone wants to be accepted. In other words,|we all just wanna be loved. Ashley, come on.|Goddamn it. - What?|- Pauly's getting out of prison. We're his ride. - We gotta go. Let's go.|- Oh, yeah. Let's go.|she's fuckin' retarded. But she's pretty. Pauly Shore is a free man.|Hi, everybody, I'm Nancy O'Dell. Hi, Nancy. Hi, folks. I'm Pat O'Brien,|and let's get right to work... with the story gripping Hollywood. Actor-comedian Pauly shore|is out of jail. Oh, shit. Is that my nigga?|Did he get out? Yeah, that's him. That's him. Look at Pauly!|That's Pauly shore! - They let that nigga out of jail.|- That's what I'm talking about. Every network, every studio head|wants a piece of Pauly. But guess what?|Access Hollywood's got him. - That's my nigga right there.|Fresh out without a doubt.|- Look at him. - Walking like a king.|- You can't keep a real nigga down. - You know what I'm saying?|- Fuck Downey and his motherfuckin'ass. - You son of a bitch.|- That's what I'm talking about. But was this a case|of art imitating life... or Pauly shore|imitating some pretty bad art? You see, shore was|more popular dead than alive. since his simulated suicide,|it seems everybody wanted a piece of Pauly. The question remains: Is shore|a shrewd shyster or a genuine genius? see, the thing about|Pauly shore is he's a genius. The guy was always one step ahead of Hollywood.|I mean, look at Meet the Parents. It's a blatant rip off of|Son in Law. The guy just never got his due,|'cause, uh, he was too good. You know what I mean?|Now everybody sees that. Quit calling. What? speech! speech!|Come on. Go. see what I did for you? [ Indistinct ] It was because|you weren't the Wiez! It's a--|I'd say it's a can't miss. - Okay. You got it?|- Yeah, man. I just wanna say thanks. - Don't touch me.|- No, that was great. I just wanna say thanks. Don't touch me.|Give me the pictures. - The negatives in here?|- They're in there. Good. 'Cause if I see these things showing up|anywhere, your ass is fuckin' grass. - Okay. I just wanna say--|- Get off of me. Oh, man. What's he get so mad about?|That's the way the business is. Last one there, and now... I can start working on the sequel.|[ Snickers ] Hey. We're about to order,|uh, fuck. Trevorina. And, uh-- And--|Trevorina. - And action, nigger.|- [ Laughing ] - I was trying to get you.|- I remember something|the late Robin Williams said. - Pauly who?|- Pauly shore needed to die. I know a lot of people|said that. Thanksgiving, he didn't eat|any of the turkey. He had about 1 5 ''E'' tablets|up his asshole. ''Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!'' is what he said as he popped|the last one in. It's like-- It's like|the snoop Dogg song. It's like this and like that|and like this, and, uh, you know. I mean, that's what|I think of when I think of Pauly. I've been selling oranges, homes.|[ Laughing ] Dude, fuck rehab, bro.|The only way to hit the-- I'm sorry. - That's okay.|- Dude, fuck rehab! - The only way to the top is-- Oh!|- [ screams ] Cool man. Before we go, here's|a demo of our band, staind. - I stuttered. We'll do it again.|- I thought this was a fuckin' Eminem interview. Laurie, what you|got me doing here? [ Woman ] Drop the soap! We'll meet|in the showers. I'll slit your throat, fucker. stop. There's a lot|of talking going on. This is the ad-lib,|or not the ad-lib-- This is when he says,|uh, at the end of the killing-me scene... says, uh, um--|What does he say? - It's a wild track for the prison scene.|- Right. Hey, Pauly.|Tom Sizemore. Thanks for the-the|sweet message. I had an incredibly good time|that day. You're a natural-born director. You really are, and thanks|for involving me. Okay? And when it comes time to do press,|if you need me to say some kind things... don't hesitate to ask me to do anything|to help your movie, okay? - I mean that.|- [ Beeps ] [ Sam kinison ] We love you, Hollywood.|Thank you for coming out tonight.! [ Crowd Cheering, Applauding ] [ Together] Whoo-hoo!|Yeah. Congratulations on the movie, Vern. - Thanks.|- Whoo-hoo! Cheers. - Don't you think we should go get Pauly?|- Fuck him. There's not enough of|you girls to go around. - Yeah, we got you, Vern.|- Yeah, baby. Congratulations. Knock it off|with the pinky shit. Where's Duke? Duke.|Come here, Duke. [ Woman ]|Whoo-hoo.!
