Today is the first day of the rest ofher life. And while she may look like just another carefree college applicant- She's not. Excuse me. - Do you know where the admissions office is? - Left at the fire hydrant. Follow the path inside. First floor. Thank you. You're a lifesaver. Okay, that was weird. She's Maya Dolittle. And she can talk to animals. I mean, how cool is that? Hi. I have a 9:00 appointment with Admissions. Uh, it's Maya Dolittle. Dolittle. Maya Dolittle. As in Dr. Dolittle? As in the great Dr. Dolittle? - He's my dad. - Yo, Frank. Come here, man. Check this out. This is Dolittle's kid. The guy who single-handedly... saved that herd of Sumatran rhinos? Yeah, that's him. That's my dad. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I totally love Dr. "D." My cat, Mr. Smushy, and I have moved to a whole new level in our relationship... and it's totally because of his article, "Feeling Feline. " Uh, I guess I missed that one. Guys, I'm kinda late here. Admissions? Oh, uh, down the hall to the right. - Okay, thank you. - No problem. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Dolittle's kid. - Wow. - Hi. - Good morning. Okay, Maya. Come on. You can do this. You are confident and capable. You will be as good a veterinarian as your dad... someday. Okay, smile therapy. Okay. - Hello, Maya. My name is Doris Park Weaver- - Hello. Dean of Admissions for San Francisco University's Center for Veterinary Medicine. - Oh. It's nice to meet you. - Oh, it is so nice to meet you. Your father's been an invaluable resource to this institution. Oh, thank you. I saw him lecture once. A most impressive man. Yeah, he's lectured me many times. I mean, he's quite the lecturer. This is our admissions committee. They wanted to meet you in person. - Oh. - Your father's thesis on anxiety disorders... in anubis baboons was brilliant. Brilliant. Will you continue his research on wombat mating habits? He's done so much for the keel-billed Toucan. - So much. - You must be eager to follow in his footsteps. What's the title of his next book? - Do you think he'd sign a copy for me? - Um, yes. I'm not sure. And okay, why not? All righty then... let's have a look at your transcripts, shall we? Now then, uh... it appears your grades are, uh- Okay. Yes, well, um, my emphasis in the past year... has been more on... social aspects of maturation versus academics... in the hopes to broaden my... curriculum vitae. Ah. What about extracurricular activities? Perhaps you've joined your father on one of his expeditions. I read about his latest trip up the Amazon in Invertebrates Illustrated. - Inspiring, truly. - Mmm. Well, I was on the homecoming committee last year. And it's a lot more demanding than it sounds. Yeah. - Well, let's look at your S.A.T. Scores. - Right. Uh- I've never been that great in classroom situations. I find that I do better in a real-world environment. - Perfect. We'd love to see you in action. - In action? This is the clinic nursery. The committee and I will observe you... to see how you interact with the animals. Great. Piece of cake. You just go ahead and kick back and leave the babies to me. Yeah, all righty then. Smile therapy. Listen. Listen up, you guys. Come here. Look, this is very, very important. My interview didn't go so well just now, so I really need to impress them here. So if you guys would just cooperate, that would be greatly appreciated, okay? Okay, awesome. Um- So, boys and girls, what would we like to play today? How about we sing a song? Oh! Hello there, little goat. Uh, yes, I know that is a sound a goat makes. But you don't have to do that with me because I can talk to animals. - She wants her bottle. - Oh. Um, okay, yeah. Uh, "bah-bah. " I knew that. Uh, okay. Um- You wanna drink your bottle? Come on. Here you go. Hey! Over here, everyone! Harvey's hatched! Harvey's hatched! Oh! - Welcome to the world, baby chick. - Mama? Oh, no, no, no. I'm not your mama. - Mama. Mama. Mama. - Wha- Oh, don't cry, little kitty. - You're my mew-mew. - Your "mew-mew"? What is that? - She thinks you're her mom. - Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom. - Guess what. Guess what. Guess what. Guess what. - What? - They all think you're their mom. - I'm comin', Mama. Geronimo! Excuse me. Sorry. I got him. I saved him. - Hey, Mom, you got any treats in here? - Hey, wait! That's my purse! - Guess what. Guess what. Guess what. Guess what. Bag, man. Where's all the good stuff? - Give me the- Look! - Run for itl - This is funl - Told you you couldn't keep us locked down. If you guys don't all stop this behavior, you're all going to be on time-outl - Guess what. Guess what. Guess what. - What? What? What? That's what. - Mom! - I'm in the kitchen. - So, how'd it go? How'd it go? - Don't ask. So, uh, I'm guessing a game of fetch is out of the question? - So, how'd it go? - I blew it. They wait-listed me. And they said that was only because "I'm a Dolittle. " Oh, Maya, so sorry. Unless I can come up with a way to impress the committee within the next four weeks... they suggest that I find other alternatives to S.F.U. I don't know what I was thinking. I am not cut out for vet school. Oh, don't be so hard on yourself, Maya. You have so much natural talent. It's gonna take some time for you to develop it. But what if I can't? You're only 18. Have faith, little one. You are gonna find your own way of doing things. I promise. - Ain't ya? Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. There you go. You guys, my life is over. Les femmes, always so dramatic. Talk to me after you've had your butt sniffed by a Great Dane in a public park. - Now that's hard to live down. - You guys, I'm serious. I have four weeks to impress the admissions committee, and I have no idea how to do it. Did you try dropping my name? Everyone loves Monkey. I am- how you say- the breakout character. How 'bout I get stuck down a well like on one of those TV shows? It'll be a huge story and we'll get famous. Oh! I wonder if they'll get Lassie to play me in the movie. Sacre bleu! It's animal controll Quick, hide! The monkey has left the building. Don't look now, but he's heading your way. I'll get it. Mmm, he's young, handsome, winning smile. You better get downstairs and make a fool of yourself right away. - Hello. - Hi. Mrs. Dolittle? - Yes? - My name is Cole Fletcher. I'm an aide at the White House. This gentleman is with the Secret Service. We're here on behalf of the president of the United States. Oh, well, come in. What can I do for you gentlemen? The president has asked to see Dr. Dolittle at the White House right away. - The President? - The White House? Is he here? I'm sorry. Uh... he's in Antarctica saving a pod of bowhead whales. - Can it wait a few weeks until he comes back? - I'm afraid not. It's an urgent matter, and no one else is equipped to handle the situation. He needs someone who can talk to animals. Well, I wish there was something I could do to help, but- - I can go. - What? - What? - My name is Maya Dolittle. And I can talk to animals, just like my dad. - Really? - Really. - Jack of spades. - Jack of spades. - Oh, please. Four of hearts. - Four ofhearts. Like father, like daughter. Hold on. I need to make a call. Okay. Well, just take your time. - Maya, I am not sure that this is a good idea. - Mom. - The admissions committee said I needed to impress them, right? - Mm-hmm. So if I can get a recommendation from the president of the United States... - what's more impressive than that? - I don't know, honey. Huh? Yes, sir. Yes, I understand. Well, Miss Dolittle, looks like you're going to the White House. We are goin' to the White House! We are goin' to the White House! Ha-ha! This is unfair! This is an outrage! I'm sorry, Monkey, but you can't come. The last time I took you anywhere, we ended up in jail for disturbing the peace. If Olive Garden doesn't want you to throw food, they should have a sign. Look. I'm sorry, but this is just too important. My whole future is riding on this. I'll bring you back some soap. Later, Kong. Once again, you underestimate the tiny genius in the silly T-shirt. # The TVsays I'm not the girl that I should be # #It drives me crazy # #I'm not impressed It isn't what I want to be # #So call me lazy # #Operator, operator # - #Don't call me I'll call you later # #Operator, operator # #I'm just fine I'll call you later # # Why would I wanna be anybody else but me # #I'm never gonna fake it # # Why would I ever be anybody else but me # #I know I'm gonna make it # # Without a doubt I know what I'm about # #I'm everything I ever wanna be # #A girl like me # - #A girl like me # - Wow! #A girl like me ## I felt the same way the first time I walked through those doors. Come on. Ah, porter, my bag is in the trunk. Careful with the squeezy bone. It's a family heirloom. Ah, Miss Dolittle. Maya, this is the president's chief of staff, Mr. Harold Dorion. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Dorion. - Welcome to the White House. This is Selma Dixon. Both she and Cole are assigned to my office as interns. - Pleasure. - Thank you, gentlemen. I'll take it from here. Cole, Selma, I need those G.D.P. Reports on Kalampore on my desk in an hour. - You'll have them in half an hour, sir. - Excellent. This way, Miss Dolittle. You know, the president is very anxious to meet you, Maya. And this is the West Wing. Although the White House was finished in 1800... the West Wing wasn't added until 1902. And the Oval Office itself wasn't built until the 1930s. For over 200 years, some of our nation's most important decisions... have been made right here in this office. I can't believe you're making me go. It's spring break! All my friends are going to Florida! "All of your friends"are not the president's daughter. Courtney, this is Maya Dolittle. Hi, it's nice to meet you. We're hoping she grows out of it. Right, and I'm hoping they open a Burger King for dogs, but I'm not optimistic. - Mr. President. - Maya. Thank you for coming. I'm a huge fan of your father's. - It's an honor, Mr. President. - And who is this good-looking guy? - The man's got my vote. - This is Lucky. He is also at your service, Mr. President. You obviously understand dogs. I hope you can help with mine. Please, sit down. Harold? Yes, sir. Yes, everyone knows and loves Daisy. - Mee-yowza! - Daisy's been with the family since I was governor. She's been at my side every step of my career. She was instrumental in the president's election campaign. Look. There she is singing the national anthem at a baseball game. - She was perfectly in tune. - That is so cute! Some people think she's a symbol of this administration, of its humanity. But lately, our beloved First Dog has become, well... a nightmare. She's running amok and we don't know what to do about it. - Ah, the woman of my dreams. - Shh! Put a lid on it. - I beg your pardon? - Oh, no, not you. Him. Sorry. It takes a while to get used to. So, basically what I'm hearing is, is Daisy just needs a talking to. - I can handle that. - There's more to it than that, Maya. We're having a diplomatic crisis with the country of Kalampore. You see, Maya, Kalampore is home to the world's second largest tropical rain forest. The Boyd and Dunsmore Investment Group wants to develop the land... and has made a very lucrative offer to the royal family of Kalampore. If the development deal goes through, the rain forest will be totally destroyed... and with it, thousands of species that make it home. - That's awful. - But the president... has convinced the head of the royal family, Prince Tharoor... to reject the Dunsmore offer, and instead has proposed a treaty... that would permanently protect the land as an animal preserve. The prince was all set to sign this historic agreement last month in Kalampore... and things went horribly wrong. Unfortunately, the president came down with a terrible case of... food poisoning. - Oh, no, he didn't. - Oh, no, don't say it. Oh, yes. All over the prince. - Jelly beans? - No, thank you. The deal didn't get signed. The moment passed... and the deal fell apart. Oh, no. We've invited the prince to the U.S. We're gonna hold a state dinner in his honor. It's a last-ditch effort to repair the relationship... and convince him to sign the agreement. And that's where you come in, Maya. You see... the prince's daughter is a huge fan of Daisy. She's practically Daisy crazy. And of course, she wants to meet her... in person. - Yikes. - Exactly. The prince arrives in... eight days. What- Eight days? - Maya... - I- we need you to deliver the old Daisy before the state dinner. We are counting on you. Send in Daisy, please. - Hi, Daisy. I'm- - Listen. If you think you can waltz in here with your head-shrinking, animal-talking circus act... and turn me into some perfect, hand-licking First Dog... then you've got another thing coming, sister. I'll chew you up like an off-white athletic sock... then I'll poop you out in the Rose Garden. Wh-What did she say, Maya? Uh, she said, "Hi. " Ah. Hello, Daisy. - Daisy! Uh, Maya, please tell her not to do that. Daisy, do not sneeze on the chief of staff's pants. Oh. Okay. Well, then how 'bout this sort of thing? Daisy. Oh! - Harold. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Come here, Daisy- - Nice try, Harold. - Daisy! - Daisy, sit! - Daisy, nol #I'm tired, baby Tired of messin'with my head # - Whoops. - No! #Gonna pull myself from the ledge ## Whoopsl See ya. Wouldn't wanna be ya. What a ride. - Harold. - Sir? Have everybody pack up- the staff, the interns, the dog, Courtney. We're going to the ranch todayl The ranch? The Sterling Ranch. The president's... retreat. I call shotgun! Maya, come with me. Anyone else who wants the grand tour, hop in. Go on. Go on. I don't need you. All right, here we go. Hey, anyone over there got lotion? My skin is so dry. Hmm, maybe I can find some aloe in here. - Where do all the animals come from? - Oh, different places. Some were rescued, some were gifts of foreign dignitaries. We started the reserve to protect a few endangered species. And now we have over 30 species. Dozens have been bred and released back into the wild. Hey, hey! How's the weather down there? Wow! It's incredible. Hey, guys, look- people. This land has been in my family for over a century. About 15 years ago, I fulfilled a dream of a lifetime: Created this nature preserve and family retreat. I'm not really an animal person. Allergies. Hmph. Many of the world's greatest leaders have stayed here. And a lot ofhistory made in this place. It's my hope that next week... history will be made again. Ahh. Free at last. Now where can a monkey freshen up around here? And this brings us back to the compound. Everybody, heads upl Incomingl What's that? Oh, that used to be Courtney's play yard. Now we use it for some animals who live over there in a specially designed habitat. - Go take a look. - Okay. Hold up a second, blokes. Whoa. Look at the sheila. - Hola, chica. - Wow, hey, guys. Hi, darling. How ya doin'? Hello, beautiful lady person. Oh, no. This is bad. I am sensing very bad. Don't mind him. He's a few sandwiches short of a picnic. Look out belowl Lucky, this is a wallaby. A rock wallaby to be exact. As in rock and roll! Bonzer good times! Whoo-hoo! Oi, mates. Let's party! Where's the Pop Tarts? Come on! Let's go! Okay, that wallaby needs to chill. Tell me about it. Reminds me of this guy I used to date, Javier. Always about how his fur looked. I'm Rosie, by the way. You need the 411 on anyone or anything? These ears can hear a pin drop from a thousand yards. She calls it 411. I call it gossip. And gossip is bad- very, very bad. Oh, put an ant in it, bug breath. Let's party! - It was great. Yeah. - You liked it. Scintillating. Wow. I love what you've done with the place. - What happened? - Daisy. - But we've only been here a few minutes. - She works fast. Welcome to Sterling Ranch. Hope you have a pleasant stay. Come on, Daisy. Good girl. Here we go. Mr. President? Maya, I have to go to a meeting. The porters will show you to your room. I'm afraid you have your work cut out for you. Smile therapy? Oh, forget it! That doesn't work anyway! Not on the bookcase. Well, I'm unpacked. What am I gonna do? Daisy's not a dog. She's Hannibal Lecter with fur! I may be able to talk to animals, but I cannot work miracles. Maya, one thing I know about you is that you underestimate yourself... and sometimes you don't apply yourself completely. Have you been reading my report card again? Read it? I forged your dad's signature, remember? If I want a recommendation from the president... I'm gonna have to whip crazy Daisy into shape in less than a week. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I think I've bitten off more than I can chew. Been there. Never forget that time I caught the Volkswagen. I wish I could reach Dad. He would know what to do. Why don't you just figure out what he would do in the same situation, and try that? Hey, that's not such a bad idea. We're not man's best friend for nothin'. Hey. Hey, can you fix my hair? I don't have thumbs. First of all, Daisy, I would like to thank you for agreeing to meet with me. That was very civilized and mature of you. Well, I got to thinking about my recent behavior... and decided it was probably time to get some help. Oh, okay. So, um, tell me... when did you first notice these feelings of hostility surfacing? Gosh. I think, maybe, it all began when the president... started bringing home all these other animals. I see. I see. I think I might be, well, jealous? Yes, jealous. I see. I see. In fact, I just have so much to get off my chest... maybe it would be a good idea if we all met, you know, like- - Group therapy? - Yes! Group therapy! I'll meet you at the habitat in 10 minutes. Maybe this won't be as hard as I thought. - Hey, Daisy's back. How ya been, darlin'? - What's the word, sister? Hey, you guys. I got a problem that I need you to help me get rid of. - Whatever you need, Daisy, girl. - Your wish is my command, my Daisy. - Hello? - Holy cow! You scared me to death. - Uh, sorry. - Close the door. Close the door! Would you please? Would you close the door? Please close itl Uh, would you like to join us for group therapy? Oh, I would love to, but what if I see my shadow? What if I don't? It could affect the climate of the entire planet if I do. - Ah, the pressure is killing me! - An agoraphobic groundhog? Pretty twisted, I know. Okay. Well, I guess I'll just see you later. Maybe. Go to your safe place. Go to your safe place. Go to your safe place. Everyone, this is Maya. And she can talk to animals. Hello, Maya. Hi. Wait a second. Have we met before? No, no, never. I am, uh, Aldo. Aldo, the Italian monkey. And I am from... Napoli! Okay, Aldo. So, as many of you already know, this is Daisy... and she's been having some issues she would like to discuss with you guys. Daisy? Okay. Well, Daisy's having a quiet moment. Is there anybody else who'd like to say something? - Hmm. - Mmm. Conflicts? Issues? Anything? Come on, you guys. There's gotta be something you wanna talk about. Fine. I remember once back in New Delhi at the zoo- Oh, this was very, very bad. If I have to hear this story one more time, I'm gonna throw myself on a trap. - You are rude. Very, very rude! - I'm rude? People. I mean, folks. I mean, animals! Everybody, just chill out! - Nyah. - All right, that's just gross. Now let's all listen and respect what each other has to say. Actually, there is something I'd like to say. Bombs away! Bomb bay doors open! Aha! Bull's-eye! Nice shot. Man your battle stationsl To the barricades! Pass the ammunition. Anteater! Run for your lives! Fire at will! Gotcha! Mon dieul I mean, mamma mial You better stop- Take-a this! Stop it! Oh- I demand you stop this behavior! Direct hit! One egg-a, scrambled! So long, girliel Thanks for stoppin'byl All right, let's get back to work. I guess she's the comic relief. Hi. Can I have some roast beef, please? How 'bout you accidentally drop a T-bone on the ground for your old pal here? Forget about it. You know it gives you gas. Uh- Oh, no, not you. The dog. Don't judge me. Excuse me. Nature calls. Hey, how's it goin'? Have you tried the steak? So, Maya, how did it go today with Daisy? Uh, it was... colorful. Hmm. Good colorful, or bad colorful? Like a medium colorful. Well, I'm afraid a medium colorful just isn't gonna cut it. Maya, we need bold, brilliant, vibrant, primary colors here. We need a full-on, five-star rainbow, and we need it fast. - Yes, sir. - Oh, and, Maya... that, uh, scene today outside the barn- Just make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen in front of the president. I will, sir. I mean, I won't. It-It won't, sir. Good. Okay, check it out: "Herro," Shaggy. Rooby-rooby-doo! That's my Scooby-Doo. Gee, with that material, I'm surprised you don't have your own TV show. Wait. Hang on. "Herro," Reorge. Ruh-oh. Astro? From TheJetsons? You have got to get some new material. - Tough crowd. - Thank you. - Maya, you want to join us? - Sure. Oh, I'm so sorry, Mayo. Did you want to sit here? It's Maya. So, Maya, tell us a little bit about yourself. Oh, uh, well, I'm a senior at Hamilton High in San Francisco. Really? And where are you going to school next year? Um, well, I'm still assessing my options. But I'm considering S.F.U.'s vet school. - But why can't I go? - We've been over this before. You can't go because I think it's inappropriate... for the First Daughter to be at a party unsupervised. This is so unfair! Mom would let me go. Well, your mother happens to be making a four-nation tour, and I'm in charge around here. - What about you guys? Where do you go? - We both go to Yale. I'm a poli-sci major, and Selma's studying International Relations. With a minor in foreign languages: French, German, Russian and Cantonese. I intend to make an impact on global politics by the time I'm 30. What about you? What's your long-term goal? Long term? Um, I guess just to take care of animals. Oh, you mean like a doggie day care? How sweet. No, I mean, like a veterinarian. A doctor. But if you can't fix the president's dog... how are you gonna fix other people's animals? Oh. Could you pass the mayo, Maya? I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? I don't speak snob. What? I just don't understand you. I mean, the state dinner could be fun if- Right. It's just so fun to have the best years of my life sucked away... by stupid press events, dull political speeches and boring state dinners. Thanks, Dad! - Maya! - Yes, sir. The chief tells me that you're making headway with Daisy. I want a full progress report tomorrow, all right? - Yes, sir, sir. - I'm counting on you. How can I give a progress report when I haven't made any progress? I don't get why she doesn't dig me. You think I should grow a beard? Lucky, I have to find a different way to deal with these animals. Because Dad's way just isn't working. What usually works with you? Well, a biscuit always seems to do nicely. Yeah, right, like that's gonna work. Hmm. You comin' out today? I would, but I'm shampooing my tail. Suit yourself. Hey, everybody, look what I've got. Treats! Ding, ding. Round twol Watch your head, you monkeyl - Say hello to my little friendl - There you gol Enjoy my spicy red ant special. That's gonna be hard to get out of your hairl Oh, forget itl Come back soon, all right? Maya. What happened? I, um- See- I'm sorry, sir. I'm no good at this. - Maya. - Please, just leave me alone. I'm sure it wasn't that bad. I'm never gonna get that recommendation, so why keep embarrassing myself? But what about Daisy and me? You know, she completes me. Look. I've already let down my family and the president of the United States. Forget it. I'm cuttin' my losses. We're on the next copter out of here. Cole, I said I just wanna be left... alone. Maya, am I... interrupting? No, sir. I was just packing up. I'm sorry I disappointed you, sir, but I should have never come here in the first place. Maya, let's take a walk. You remind me a lot of myself when I was your age. - I do? - Demanded a lot of myself. Expected way too much too soon. Meet my friends. So, did you know... that MichaelJordan... didn't make his high school varsity basketball team? MichaelJordan? The best basketball player ever? No way. Way. Did you know that Einstein failed his first college entrance exam? - Wait. "E" equals "MC" squared Einstein? Really? - Yep. Did you know in high school I ran for class president? I lost. I came in fourth. Well, that's not too bad. - Out of four? - Okay, that's bad. The only thing that saved me at that time... was I had a motto I kept on my desk by Hank Aaron... a famous ballplayer before your time. Two words: "Keep swinging. " He used to say that no matter how bad his slump was... no matter how badly he felt... he just had to keep swingin'. - But, sir, I'm just afraid I can't- - Maya. "We have nothing to fear but fear itself. " That was Franklin Roosevelt. You come with me. There's somebody I want you to meet. Come on, Maya. So, this is Lenore. She's a red ruffed lemur. Give her some gooseberries. She likes 'em. She was captured by poachers as a baby, delivered to a Malaysian circus. Somehow she made her way to an Indonesian zoo and then here. She's an endangered species. And we had hopes of returning her to her homeland... but unless I can get the prince to sign this agreement... the rain forest will be destroyed. - And the other lemurs like Lenore? - Absolutely. Did you know that, on average, 74 species a day become extinct? - I had no idea. - Most people don't. All of us have so much more to learn. Maya, failure is a part of life, even for successful people. The trick is... what are you gonna do about the failure? Are you gonna quit, or are you gonna keep on swinging? Lucky, drop that bone, unpack those bags. I just got a pep talk from the president of the United States. And we are stayin'. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoa. Getting dizzy. Oh, getting dizzy. Why do dogs have to do this when they're happy? #And if you think # # That you could do better # #She's got some pretty wise sage advice # #For you if you let her # #And she'll let you know # # We never go in the heat of competition # # Tell me everything you know # - #About the human condition And wait # # Till the meter maids are doin'their job # #And they're callin'the cops 'cause they're afraid too # # 'Cause it's makin'a lot # What are you doing? Did you know that Cavalier King Charles spaniels were originally bred for British royalty? Here you go, Daisy. Okay. So, what do you think? What do you think? Stee-rike one. It's important that you keep me posted on exactly when and where... the prince and his- when the prince comes- Hold on a second. Maya, what are you doing? Did you know that King Charles spaniels are the happiest... when they're sitting in someone's lap? I think it's working. I'll have to call you back. Stee-rike two. Do you know that your breed is extremely social and loves to play and fetch? - Two words: "Give up. " - Two words: "No way. " One word: "Later"! Just keep swingin'. Stee-rike three! You're out. Remember back in ninth grade when I had that cafeteria feud with Wendy Boudreau? Who could forget her? Her face looked like the business end of a bulldog. And how did I handle that situation? I made friends with her friends. Interesting. I would have just pooped in her shoes. Lucky, I think it's time for another group therapy session. Come on. Hey, are you gonna join us today? Ah, uh, yeah, I, um- Remember what F.D.R. Said: "We have nothing to fear but fear itself. " You're right. You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm coming out. Here I come. Doh! - I just can't do it. - Okay. Whenever you're ready. All right, Maya. Let's go make some friends. Hello, everyone. - How are y'all doin' today? - Rats! I think last time we started off on the wrong foot. Let's start off fresh, shall we? You have foiled my poop bomb. I am most impressed. Horacio, I know you miss your girlfriends back in Venezuela. Yes. This is true. You're feeling lonely because you're the only Amazon parrot within a hundred-mile radius. Yes. This, too, is true. You're feeling the pressure of having to be exotic and colorful 24-7. You have seen into my soul. Wait a second. What's goin' on here? Bruce, you're numbing out, partying all the time... because you feel like, otherwise, everybody's gonna think you're boring. - Isn't that right? - Crikey, you don't know what it's like... to be a party animal. And, Rosie, you like gossiping all the time... because then you feel like you're the center of attention. But you feel some deep shame when it's all over, don't you? - I just wanna be liked. - I like you, mate. Yeah. We all think that you're an amazing chinchilla, don't we? - Don't we? - I like you, Rosie. - Me too. - Me three. Hey, don't fall for this. She's trying to trick you. And, Aldo, my monkey friend... I know you miss your carefree days ofbeing in the alfresco markets of Italy. You're sad because you miss your family back in Naples. You miss your papa's red wine and your sweet grandmama's cannoli. Ah, sweet grandmama. I am not Aldo or Italian. I do not even have a grandmama. L- It's me, Maya, your Monkey! Oh, I know, Monkey. And I'm so sorry. And I'll never leave you again, okay? - Off you go. - That is so beautiful. Anteater? Come on. Blow. Come on, you guys. Get it together. Repeat after me: "This is very, very good. " This is very, very... good. - See? Now how does that feel? - It feels very, very... good! You seem all right, girlie. Why would you want to send Daisy to the pound? What? The pound? Where would you get a crazy idea like that? I'll give you one guess. Aha! - I'm outta here. - Ay, Daisy, please. - Don't go. - Daisy, come back. Oh, and I was just starting to feel good. What am I gonna do? The prince is gonna be here in two days. I just don't understand why Daisy's behaving this way. There must be something I'm missing, but what? Hello? - Hey, did you hear that? - What is it, Lucky? Yeah. Yeah, I can totally come. Clearwater Campground. Okay. I'll be there. I can't see. What's she doing? What's she doing? Something she shouldn't be doing. Just a second. - Hey, Maya. - Hey, can you do me a huge favor? - Can you drive me somewhere? No questions asked. - I would, but I don't have a car. Gotta be some wheels around here somewhere. - You know, we can probably find somethin'. - Okay. Man, can you make this thing go any faster? I'm already pedal to the metal. This Clearwater Campground has to be around here somewhere. Stay here. I'll be right back. - That's great. - Where did you get that? Great. So now you're following me? It's bad enough I've got Secret Service on my back. Now I've got the Dog Chatterer? Your dad would freak out if he found out you were here... - without Secret Service protection. - I can take care of myself. - Yeah. Right. - Wait a minute. Now I know where I know you from. - You're the president's freakin' daughter. - What? No. No, I'm- I'm- Dude, dude! It's the First freakin' Daughter, man. - Who's got a camera? - No! - Come on. Come on. One picture. - No. No pictures. She said, no pictures. Oh, and what are you gonna do, huh? Call Secret Service? - Ow! - No, but I will. I think it's time to leave. - He got served. - Oh! - Cute. - How did you do that? Fifteen years of tae kwon do classes just paid off. I'll be right back. You girls stay right here, okay? So... I suppose you think I'm a spoiled, ungrateful, irresponsible brat. The thought crossed my mind. You have no idea what it's like to be the daughter... of a national hero- all the expectations that are heaped on you- And you feel like you'll never be able to measure up to your father's greatness- like you have to be perfect all the time- so what's the point? Yes, exactly. How did- - Your father. - That's right. Dr. Dolittle, beloved veterinarian. - National hero. - Mm-hmm. This past year I lost sight of my priorities. I let my grades drop, blew off my responsibilities... - and completely screwed up my college application. But I think the truth is, I was afraid- afraid I wouldn't be able to live up to my father's reputation. And comin' here helped me remember what's important to me in my life... and that's the animals- even though I had to mess up big-time to figure that out. It's just... he always expects me to be perfect. Now do you really believe that? Or is that just what you tell yourself so you can stay mad at him? Your father is not perfect. He makes mistakes just like everybody else. - Did you know that he ran for class president and lost? - No way. Way. So just give him a chance... and you'll realize that he just wants what's best for you. Not a word from either one of you. No, pink's totally your color. Come on. Hop up here. Hey! Who's hungry? # You can't see it coming # # Until it's too late # # You're struck down by the hand of fate # Hot fudge is comin' in here. # With or without # - #And when you do it's always too late # - Looks so good. - #Ooh, it's all sunshine # - Sprinkles. - #Or it's all rain # - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - #Ooh, it's all sunshine ## - Enough sprinkles! - Let's eat. Gotta get some whipped cream. Whoop! Oh, you think that's funny, huh? That's funny? Uh, okay. Here. Whoa! Courtney, where have you been? We have been looking everywhere for you. Well, I, uh- Uh, s-sir, it was... all my fault. I snuck out, and Courtney followed me and Cole followed her. Maya, this is not fun and games here. The prince's visit is in two days'time... and as far as I can see, Daisy is no farther along than she was a week ago. - I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again. - Make sure that it doesn't. - Cole, we'll talk about this in the morning. - Yes, sir. And your father wants to see you immediately. That was pretty cool of you back there, takin'the hit for Courtney. That was pretty cool of you back at that party. I don't know what we would have done without you. Yeah, well, I'm glad I could help out. I've never seen Courtney laugh like that. Yeah, I have a feeling things are gonna start changing for the better. - It's just the pressure of bein' the First Daughter. - Who could blame her? Yeah. Now if only Daisy was that simple to figure out. Wait a minute. Maybe Daisy is that simple. I can't believe it. It's been right under my nose the entire time. Oh, you are a genius! I... didn't... say anything. Daisyl Daisy! Where could she have gone? Daisy! Daisy! Come on, girl. Dais- Rosie, I have been looking for Daisy all over the place. Have you heard anything? I might have heard a few things, but I can't say. - What? Why not? - I gave up gossiping. I am a changed chinchilla. Rosie, that's not gossiping. That's helping out a friend. Hmm. Here. I think we should conclude with this paragraph right here. You guys, Daisy's gone. She ran away. What? Well, let's go find her. Cole, we have a presentation due in two hours for the chief of staff. It's just a dog. Just a dog? You know what? If that's really what you think, then I feel sorry for you. And I hate to break it to you, but some things are more important than your career. Come on, Maya. There's Courtney! Courtney! Courtney! I've been looking for Daisy everywhere and none of the other animals have seen her either. I think she ran away. - What? - I can't find her anywhere. - Don't worry. We'll help you find her. - Let's go this way. Okay. Bruce, you head out north. Horacio, Monkey, you guys go south. Chinchilla, keep your ear to the ground. Lucky, you're with us. Leave no stone unturned. We've got to find this dog. Yes. We go south! I have no idea which way is south. Follow me. One thing this bird's got is G.P.S. - You got it, baby. - Game on! Okay. Let's go. Hey. Mind if I tag along? I figured you could use all the help you could get. Thanks. Come on. Daisyl - Daisy! - Daisy! - Here, girl! Daisy, come on! - Daisy! - Daisy! - Daisy! We've been looking for hours. It's no use. There's a thousand acres here. She could be anywhere. - Anything, Lucky? - Mm-mmm. Reporting in from units two and three. No sign of the pooch. Courtney, is there anywhere she would have gone? A special place, somethin' like that? Think hard. I don't know. I don't know. Wait. I have an idea. We used to play here all the time when I was a kid. - There she is! - Wait. Can I have a minute alone with her? Come on. Trust me. Okay. We'll meet you back at the ranch. - Hey, girl. - Go away. Daisy, I know it's a lot of pressure being the First Dog. You can rebel all you want, but you can't run away from who you are. None of us can. I just want things to be the way they used to be. When he was governor, we were a family. We would spend time together, play fetch, go jogging, but now everything's changed. It's always the cameras, meetings, events, and I'm just a political prop. You are so much more than that, Daisy. You are an inspiration to the people of this country. And there's not many animals or people who can even say that. I don't want to be an inspiration. I just want to be... a dog. Daisy, come here. Come here. Come here, girl. You are a dog- an amazing dog- and you have a family that loves you very much. But the thing is, every family has its own set of problems, its frustrations... and we're always wishing that things were different. But what if, instead of running away from who we are... we just started embracing it. You're right, Maya. You're right. You sure they're gonna be all right out there? I think we have to trust her, Dad. Hey, hey, look, everyone! Oh, Daisy! Come onl Come on, girl. - Daisy! Come on. - Oh, good girl. Yeah. Don't you ever run away like that again. You scared the daylights out of us. I think Daisy is finally ready to talk, if you guys are ready to listen. Come on, girl. I've got your favorite treats inside. - Courtney and I also had a talk this morning. - Oh? She told me everything: About the party, about how you covered for her. Gave us an opportunity for our first really good talk in a long time... thanks to you, Maya. I'm glad I could help. Excellent work, Maya. All right, everybody, we have a state dinner to prepare for. # Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa # - #Someday # - #I'll buy an old car # - #Mmm # - #Someday # - #I'll get that car to start # - #Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh # - #Someday # - #I'll learn how to drive too # #Mm-hmm and then someday # #Imagine all the things I could do # - # Whoo # - #Someday # - #I'll get that car to start # - #Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh # #Someday # #I'll learn how to drive too # # Yes, I will now And then someday # #Imagine all the things I could do ## Your Highness, thank you for coming. It's my great pleasure to welcome you to Sterling Ranch. Mr. President, it is indeed my pleasure. I look forward to a fruitful and productive visit. You must be tired from your travels. My staff will show you to your quarters... and I look forward to seeing you this evening at the dinner. Thank you, Mr. President. We've got our work cut out for us. Ladies and gentlemen, please rise. Ladies and gentlemen, His Royal Highness... Prince Tharoor of Kalampore. - Your Highness, welcome. - Mr. President. May I present my daughter, Courtney. My daughter, Amina. I'm so nervous. - It'll be fine. You've done everything you can. - It's gonna go great. - Hi, Maya! Hey, it's us. - Ay, beautiful fiesta. I wanna go. I wanna go. I wanna go! Put a cork in it, Bonzo. It's a people party. Alas, my life story. And now, the First Dog, Daisy. Where is she? Where is she? - Ohl There she is. - There she is. We are pleased to meet you, Daisy. The Kalampore National Anthem. She's so cute. Hold on. Yes? Everything's under control. I have something that'll make those bad oysters I gave him in Kalampore seem like high tea. After tonight, there's no way the prince will sign that agreement. The only document linking me to this deal... is locked in a safe in my office. I assure you, Mr. Dunsmore, that rain forest is history... and you and I are going to be very rich. Oh, no. Oh, no, the chief is a rat! I gotta do somethin'. I gotta tell somebody. Oh, if only I could leave this house, but I can'tl All right. Okay, if I leave this house, what's the worst thing that's gonna happen? Okay, people will think that spring is early. But I'm not the only groundhog. It's not all on my shoulders. And the rain forest. The rain forest is at sta- But there are other rain forests. I can't stand-I've gotta gol I'm goin'I Stand backl I did it! I'm goin'! I'm goin'! We have nothing to fear but fear itself. This is a wonderful night, Mr. President. Your family is lovely. This place, the animals- so inspiring. Well, I hope we managed to convey to you how sorry we were- Back home we say, "However long the night, the day will break. " - Ah. - That is in the past. We must work to the future. Psst. Maya. Mayal Under the table. Hey, you left your house. Congratulations. What are you doin' here? We got a big problem. This is terrible. Are you sure about this? You think that I would've left my house if I wasn't sure? Okay. Well, round up all the animals. I think I have a plan. Oh, by the way, can you whistle? Nope. Groundhogs talk to each other by whistling. You're not a groundhog. You're a prairie dog. Prairie do- Oh, no. Now I'm having an identity crisis. So, tell me again your thoughts on my rain forest. - How might we come together on this issue? - Oh, I'm so glad you asked me. - Everybody understand the plan? - Are you sure about this, Maya? If this goes wrong, you could get in serious trouble. That's just a chance I'm gonna have to take. Okay. You guys get the evidence from the safe. I'll make sure the president doesn't eat. Good luck. Hey, shouldn't we synchronize our watches? - Hey, where have you been? - Oh, um, I-I'll tell you later. Ay, Dios mol Ha-ha! Got itl Let's go! Shh! Nothing here? Nope. Nothin' in here. - Nothing here. - Zilch-a-roonie here. - Hey, guys. I found it! - Ha-ha! Incomingl Someone's on me taill Watch it, buster. I am not that kind of chinchilla. Shh. Everyone be quiet. - Monkey, where's your tail? - Uh-ohl Ooh, la, la. Ooh, la, la. - Back to work, everyone! - Go, Monkey, gol Now, where was I? Ladies and gentlemen- First of all, I wish to say... I appreciate all that you have done, Mr. President... for the global environment and for making this such a wonderful night. Thank you. And I want to announce at this time... I will sign the agreement. Your Highness, thank you. And I would like to propose a toast. To His Highness, Prince Tharoor... and to a long and fruitful collaboration between our two countries. And to President Sterling... for going so far to arrange this wonderful night. - You are a most generous host. - I thank you. - To the president. - Cheers. And now, dinner is served. A little more to the left. A little more. Poquito ms. Keep going. Keep going- Stop! You're loving me for the ears right now, aren't you? Stop! Uh, hi, Your Highness. I'm sorry. Your Highness, this is Maya Dolittle. Ah! Yes, yes, yes. Your father's reputation is truly world renowned. Mmm. Thank you. Oh, I-I'd- Was there something you wanted to say, Maya? No. I mean, yes. Um, I would like to just tell a joke. It's an American tradition: Joke before dinner. - Maya- - So. Why do cows wear bells? Because their horns don't work! You get it? 'Cause the horns go, "beep, beep"- Uh-huh. Stopl Okay, back to the right. The other rightl Okay. So there were two fish in a tank. And one fish says to the other fish... "Do you know how to drive this thing?" 'Cause they're in a tank. You get it? 'Cause- Yeah. I really- I love that one. - Maya? - Hmm? - Thank you. - But I- Maya, thank you. Yes, sir. Well, folks, let's eat. Mmm. - You okay? - I guess so. - Excuse me for one moment, Mr. President. - Mmm. I must confer with my adviser about our agreement. Of course. To the left, and... stop! That's it. Go, Parrot, gol - Gotcha. - Ha-hal Mission accomplished. - Got it. - Go, dog, gol Vaya con Dios. I feel weird. Wait a second. It wasn't the president's food. It was Daisy's! - Get this dog off of mel Nowl - Your Highnessl You have insulted Prince Tharoor for the last time. The deal is off! - Your Highness, please- - I said, the deal is off! We are leaving. Your Highness- Wait! Stop! Chief Dorion is responsible for everything. He spiked Daisy's food tonight... and he was the one who gave the president bad oysters in Kalampore. What? That's- That's ridiculous. This is just a sad and pathetic attempt to cover up your own incompetence, Miss Dolittle. - Secret Service, get her out of here. - Harold, let's hear her out. - Sir, really, I- - Harold. He doesn't want you and the prince to sign the agreement. He's been trying to sabotage the entire thing. - That's preposterous. - It's the truth! - The groundhog overheard you on your cell phone tonight. - The groundhog? Well, he's a prairie dog who thinks he's a groundhog. So, your alleged proof of this outrageous story... is the word of a prairie dog who thinks he's a groundhog? Secret Service, please. Maya. I'm sorry I disappointed you, Mr. President. Woof! Woof! Beg your pardon. Dog savin'the day. Comin' through. Make way. Great dress, lady. - Comin'through here. - Come on. Sorry about the saliva. Hmm. Actually, it's the word of a prairie dog... and... these. These documents show that Chief Dorion is a silent partner... in Boyd and Dunsmore Investment Group. And he stands to make millions if the rain forest is developed. Where did you get those documents? Harold, I would get a very expensive lawyer. I never did like that man. The only thing I hate more than animals is teenagersl Miss Dolittle, I cannot thank you enough. You have brought the people of Kalampore and United States together. - You are truly a hero. - Thank you. I wanted to change the world before I was 30. She's changed it before she's even 20. You were so brave. I barely got out with my life, but it was worth it. Who has got a pen? We have an agreement to sign.

And a rain forest was saved. I mean, how cool is that? I mean, how cool is- Hey, wait a second. She got in? She's goin'away to college? What's gonna happen to me? Mayal Uh, Maya?
