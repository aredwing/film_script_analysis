His love shines over evil things I'll be right beside you... Right beside you! In this life I'll be the knight I'll be right beside you... So I was thinking maybe you'd come down to the dealership, sign a few balls or something this Saturday. Nobody wants my autograph, Milt. You never know, man. Come on, seriously. Last time worked out. Could be a win-win for both of us. There she is. Shots. I got this. Don't reach for your wallet. All right, man. - No, don't reach for your wallet. - Thank you. Here you go, sunshine. Next round's on me, I guess. Thank you! Ladies and gentlemen, I think there's somebody here tonight who deserves just a little bit of recognition, all right? - Here it is. - No. Now, it's not because he's a regular here at Stevie Ray's... Is he talking about me? ...or because he was an All-American at Stevenson High School... True story, true story. ...or even because he was a Detroit Tiger. That's right! Yeah! Simply because it's his birthday. Give it up for Calvin Campbell. He's a jolly good fellow He's a jolly good fellow - He's a jolly good fellow...- - A cake! - Which nobody can deny. Dang it. Dang it. Hey, Katie bear. Hi. You said you'd be home by 9:30, Dad. I know. I'm sorry. Dang it, I'm sorry. Milt and Frankie, they wanted to celebrate my birthday, so they took me out for some, dinner and we just got a little... - You're drunk. - No. Yeah. Yeah, not too much that I can't drive, though, if that's what you're thinking, 'cause I'm good. Um, sweetheart, we're gonna celebrate when I get home, okay? Hello? God. This guy's drunk. Look at this. He's a mess! Where do you think you're going? - It's 11:15. - Out with Colt. No, no. I told you that I didn't want you to see that boy anymore. Yeah? Well, at least somebody loves me. You are 16 years old. I'm 17, Dad. What happened to us spending my birthday together? What happened? I don't know. What time did you get home? Late. - You making some for me? - Yes. I know late. What time? I don't know. Colt won his sprint car heat. We went out to celebrate. At least I got to celebrate something with somebody. I like my eggs over easy. Yeah, I want to say something about Colt. He's like a... he's like a fastball from Nolan Ryan when he was in the prime of his game. - What does that even mean? - It means he's too much for you to handle. Dad, can't we just have a normal conversation with breakfast? Yeah, that's fine. What are you gonna do today? Mall and movie. - I need the car. - I'm using the car. Don't you think it's about time you got a real job again, Dad? So we can afford things? Like, say, two cars? You know what? I'm the dad and you're the kid. So you don't talk to me about getting a job or getting a second car. Do you understand me? The other thing about Colt, young lady, is that he is too old for you. And I know what old kids want. - I know what they're after. - Okay. Are you guys having... are you having sex? Really? Really, Dad? Really? You are such a freaking hypocrite. I can have all the sex I want. You were obviously doing it in high school. Yeah. Yeah, exactly, and I don't want you to make the same mistakes that I was making. So, I'm a mistake? That's not what I said, Katie. - Wow, Dad. - Katie... - that's not what I said. - Well, you did. You know what? Maybe you don't like Colt because you're just jealous he's an athlete on the way up and you're... you. My heart holds a question between every beat... - Dexter, how are you? Got every answer beneath my feet Fallin' apart, but I never know why Walked every road but the one that's right Been chasin' my tail instead of my dream Life's just a game, but you play it for keeps Ooh. Whoops. Hey, Produce... sorry, pal, I think I just trampled on one of your vegetables. A tomato is a fruit. What'd you say? A tomato is a fruit. So are avocados, cucumbers, and olives. All fruits. Well... that's pretty good information. - Thanks. - You're pretty smart. - You think I'm smart? - Sure. Do you want to see how smart that I am? You know what? Maybe another day. I'm just... I'm not really in the mood for it today, man. - Sorry about that. - Okay. Have a magnificent day. All right. Hey, Miss Amy, how you doing? Hey, Produce. I'm great. How are you doing? - Incredible. - Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Look what I'm getting. Mr. Campbell, you over there messing with Produce? - Excuse me. - Sorry. Just having a conversation with him, Colt. I'm sure it was compelling. You know? All right, see ya. But also putting strawberries on the top of waffles. - Look at you. - Okay. - What else is fresh today? - Tomatoes are fresh. They look good. Hey, Produce, thank you for that information over there about the fruits and vegetables and... You're welcome. My mama said - those are not good for you. - This? Well, your mama sounds like a smart person, too. - Thanks. - Yeah. Could be good advice. Could be good advice if I followed it. Hey, he's a s... you know? - The hugging. - He's a hugger. What's that about? It's just his way of being friendly. Yeah. I'm Calvin. Amy. It's nice to meet you, Amy. Nice to meet you. Would you like to have somebody to help you shop more? Please help me shop. And I found the beauty that I couldn't see And it's everything I want And so much more You It was always you. Yeah! Thanks, man. That was beautiful. Thank you. It still needs a lot of work, but I appreciate it. Look... there's no one here, Frank. I could really use an extra hand cleaning up in the back. Laura, I'm not the janitor. I know, but... Hey, buddy, it was a beautiful song. It got me. They're lucky to have you here, Frankie. What's this? She forget her broomstick? She left that for me. Got work to do. I'll see you later, man. You didn't leave me any coffee. You know how to work the coffeemaker, Katie. No, you drank it all, Dad. There's none in the bag. That's what I'm saying. Well, I will... I will run to the store and get some more when I'm finished with my paper. Hey, Dad? How about we go see a movie or something later? I'd love to, Katie, but I think I have to meet Milt and Frank later. Sorry, kiddo. Hi, Mr. Campbell. How you doing this afternoon? I'm fine. How are you? I'm doing good. Even when I'm doing bad, I'm doing good. Sounds pretty deep. Have a magnificent day. You know what? Um... I wasn't being honest with you, Produce. I'm not fine. Well, are you sick? - I don't think so. - Maybe you just need to smile. "A cheerful heart is good medicine." Where'd you get that? A bumper sticker? You told me that I was smart. - Remember? - Yeah. You wanna see how smart I am? Well, I'll tell you what. Maybe not today, because I gotta... I gotta... - Pick up that melon. - All right. They label all of these fruits and vegetables with some numbers on them. But I know the number on the top of that melon. - Okay, go. - 4329. Yeah, 4329. That's correct. That's impressive, Produce. Good job. Pear. Anjou. Yep. Correct. Banana. That's the easy one. Everybody likes bananas. Gala apple. 4135. Orange. 9669. Tangerine. 3144. Granny Smith apple. Yeah. There we go. I'm really impressed. I mean, you're kinda like "Rain Man" or something. Like Superman or Batman! You're proud of me 'cause I'm smart. - I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell. - No, that's all right. He didn't realize he was bugging you. What did I tell you about hugging the customers? Now you get back to work, young man. You have a nice day, Mr. Campbell. - You, too, Dexter. - I'm sorry about the hug. Nah, like I said. Hey, Produce. I'm impressed. - Frank? - Hi, Susan. Is Milt here? Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah, it's good. I just need to talk to him. Yeah, come in. - You doing all right? - Yeah, nice to see you. - You, too. - Milt. - Hey, buddy, what's up? - What's up, man? - What's up? - You doing all right? Yeah. What's going on? Okay, um... there's no easy way to ask you this, so... - Okay. - I need to borrow some money for a hotel room. It's not long. I'll pay you back. - What happened? - I got evicted. Hadn't paid in a while, so kinda had it comin'. Well, you're not getting in any hotel, all right? You stay here, all right? We got plenty of room. - You're like family. - Man, I... No, no, no, no. Stay here. We got plenty of room. So I got some towels if you want to take a shower and help yourself to anything in the kitchen. Thank you. You're welcome. No. Colt, hang on. What? What's going on? Just slow down. The hell are you doing? I'm cold. Come on, take that jacket off, get back in bed. You know how many girls wanna get with me right now? But here I am. I'm trying to be faithful to you. I just want it to be special for my first time. Wait, you... so you're... you're a virgin? - Yeah. - But you said that you've been... I know. I... I lied. I just wanted you to like me, so I said it. This is awesome, you know that? Listen, I got some wine out in my Jeep, okay? It's in a box, so we don't need an opener or anything. - That's special, right? - You don't get it. No, you don't get it, Katie. You can't just tease a guy like this. I said just lay back down. - Katie? Hey, Katie? Hey, Katie bear, I just... I just wanted to come say good night. Wha... hey. What are you doing with your jacket on in your bed? Hey, what's wrong? Is there something I can do to help? Please get out. Okay. Hey, Mr. Campbell. How you doing? Where's the shopping cart? I don't know. I'm not here to shop. I guess I just... I guess I just came to talk. To me? Yeah, to you. I guess I could use some of that magical happiness that you always seem to have. - So, what's your secret? - It's no secret, Mr. Campbell. Well, you're doing something right. You're doing a heck of a lot better than I'm doing. Do you think that I'm smart enough to do anything? Anything in the whole wide world? - Well, come on. - Where are we going? All right. Where... where are we going, buddy? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look it. I'm not authorized personnel. I can't go back there. Please, Mr. Campbell? Come... please? - Come on. - All right. - Come on. - What are we doing? What? What is this? I'm not smart enough to be the Employee of the Month. Shoot. Yeah, you are. - Really? - Let me ask you a question. Do you think that Colt can name every fruit number on every piece of fruit in the store? But I can name all the vegetables, too. Yeah, exactly. That's my point. He can't do that. Hey, Produce. Sometimes... well, sometimes life is not fair. You know? And sometimes we don't get what we want. What do you do for work? Well... I've done... I don't know, I've done a few things here and there. I used to play baseball. Wow! Will you show me how? Well, you know, I haven't... whoa, I haven't played baseball in a long, long time, Produce. I've always wanted to play baseball. You really want to learn how to play? Yeah! Okay. This is what I want you to do. I want you to stand over this box. That's the home plate. And then you're just going to swing this broomstick like it's a baseball bat. Hey, Produce? Not on the box. Over the box. There you go. Just stand like that, okay? All right, Produce, I just want you to keep your eye on the ball. - It's an orange. - That's very perceptive. Just swing when it comes near you, all right? All righty then. I'm going to hit a home run! Well, not if I strike you out first, kid. You ready? Here comes the heater. - It's all right. - Strike one. It's all right. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to keep your shoulders in, okay? Keep your eye on the orange. And I always want you to look for the rotation of the pitch at its highest point, okay? That's when it's leaving my... never mind, just... - just swing away and have fun. - Okay. Yeah, Produce! Highest point, all right? Close. All right. There we go. There it is! There it is. Here comes a tomato. Keep your eye on the ball. - Ooh. - All right, here we go. Boom! There it is! Nice! All right, there we go. - No! - Grapefruit. Yeah! Produce! Where the heck have you been? Get a new apron and get back to work! Hey, Produce, how's it going, man? - Incredible, man. - That's great. That's great. Listen, if you tell anyone what you just saw, there's gonna be some problems for you. But you took the bottle. - It's not yours. - I know. The thing is, I'd pay for it if I was 21, but I'm not, so I can't. - Understand? - Understand. - All right. - Hey, speed demon. - Mr. Jenkins, how are you, sir? - Great, great. Hey, I caught your race last Saturday night. - Thank you. - So when are they gonna go ahead and just let you race in the 500? Thank you, sir. You're too kind. Well, keep up the good work, son. You're making us all proud around here. Thank you, thank you. Hey, not a word, you understand me? - Yeah. - All right, great. - Hey, Produce. - Hey, what are you doing out here? I was wondering if you wanted to go somewhere with me. Where do we want to go? Come on. It'll be a surprise. Don't need to worry 'bout me I've got everything I need To be free from all ya other ballers And when I bust out this groove You'll see the room start to move So let me hear you holler... - Dang it! - It's all right. You just need to concentrate. You need to keep your eye on the ball. And I want you to put your elbows in. Okay, transfer your weight back. The swing is all in your wrist. - Let's see. I'm never gonna hit a baseball! You're gonna hit a baseball and be positive! If you keep telling yourself that you're never gonna hit a baseball, guess what. - I won't hit it. - That's right, exactly. Baseball is 75% mental. Trust me. I remember you hitting that two-run double off of Clemens back in the 2000 ALCS? Do I know you? Steve. Bookerson. I was out of the league by 2000. Right, it was... '99. Hey, Produce, try to swing level. Do you ever think about getting back into the game? Nope. Well, that's a shame because I'm the assistant GM of the Louisville Bats. We're looking to fill our manager's position and I'd like it to be a local boy. You know what? I got a kid at home that I can't handle. I don't think I want to be in charge of 30 more. Look, you were one of the smartest players I had ever seen back in... Hey, don't you get it, Steve? I wasn't as good as you or everyone like you thought I was. I couldn't hack it when it counted and I don't want to relive that. Okay? So thank you, but no, thank you. I just wanted to offer you the opportunity if you wanted it. It's a good-paying gig. But if you got other stuff going on... Not really. Look, why don't you stop by the stadium Sunday evening 6:00 PM. Sunday at 6:00? The GM, he'd be excited to meet you and if you don't like it... - Okay. - ...you can always walk away. Yeah, I'll... I'll be there. Great. I'll count on it. Hey, you ready? I had a good day today. I took this... this kid who... I don't know, he's... he's, like, slow or whatever. - You know? - Slow or whatever? Like slow like what? Like can't win a race? Or slow like retarded? Yeah, no, he's got Down Syndrome. I don't know. It was a good day. He's a happy kid. He's a good, happy kid. - Yeah, great. - That's good, man. You know what would make me happy? If you buy... How about you buy a round of beer? That'd make me happy. How about that? Colt. Colt! - What are you doing? - Stay out of this, Katie. - You need my help, bro? - No, man, I think I got it. Hey! Hey, where do you think you're going? What are you doing, Colt? Stay out of this, Katie. It's got nothing to do with you. Listen, man, I told you to keep your mouth shut. I got fired today 'cause of you. - You did something bad. - What? What exactly did I do to you? Nothing! I did absolutely nothing to you. I came to give Mr. Campbell a melon. This melon? You came to give Mr. Campbell this melon? Yes. Don't break Mr. Campbell's melon! Colt! Leave him alone, Colt! Can't you see he's different?! All right, man, you know what? Take your melon. Come on, guys, let's get out of here. Produce. What are you doing here? Where's Katie? She left. I brought you a melon. I see that. Um... that was nice of you. Does your mama know where you are? You don't like my melon? Aw... That's not it at all, Produce. - Thank you for the melon. - You're welcome. So... why are you all dirty? Did you fall off your bike? - Yes. - Are you hurt? - No. - You okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Well... um... do you want a ride home? - You smell funny. - Yeah, it's... that's what the French call eau de Bourbon. Not funny? Okay. Well, I'm gonna go, to sleep 'cause it's real, real late and, um, I'll see ya tomorrow or whenever. - Good-bye. - Hey, Produce? Hey. Thank you for my melon. You're welcome. And away he goes. He... Produ... Produce, you forgot your... hey... Hey, Katie bear? Which, which tie do you think I should wear? This one or this one? - Neither. - No? No, you're not much of a tie guy. Yeah, I guess you're right. Why are you so dressed up? I got that meeting tonight. The owners of the Bats, you remember? - Yeah, that's right. - Yeah. - That's awesome, Dad. - Thanks. So just call me after and we can grab dinner to celebrate. Yeah, okay. - I'd like that. - Me, too. - Well, all right, then, it's a date. - Okay. All right. Mr. Campbell! You should tell your mentally challenged friend not to come around here anymore. Produce? Why? Colt says he's a troublemaker. He's not a troublemaker. Colt on the other hand... Can you open the door for him, please? Dad, Colt is gonna be here any minute. Yeah, I don't care about Colt. Okay, well, just make it quick. - Hi. - Hey. - Is that for me? - Yes, it is. - Thanks. - You're welcome. I got them from the flowers department and they've got plants there, too. I'm gonna go put them in water. - Okay. - Okay.

It's exactly where you left it. - Here you go, big guy. - Thank you. Hey, you look sharp. Where you going? Thanks. I'm going to church. It practically starts in 17 minutes. - Practically? - Look at my watch. My mama told me it has all the whistles and all the bells. Yeah, well, I think your mama's right. It looks like it does. - It's a beautiful timepiece, Produce. - Thank you. Do you want to come to church with me? No. It's been a long time since someone got me flowers. - So, thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, Produce, let me ask you a question. What do you think of that boy? Well, I think he's arrogant and I would love to give him a karate chop. Me, too, boy. Me, too. All right, have a good Sunday. Well, I don't want to be late. If I ride my bike, I'll be late. Can you please give me a ride? - Please? - But I've got to go play golf with my friend. And then afterwards I got a real big meeting. - So... - I know... I know that. I do understand that, but I need a ride, please. Give me a ride, please. All right, what time... how... how... all right, just... Now I'm gonna drop you off, but I'm not going inside. Your daughter is extremely sweet. Yes. I just wish she came with an instruction manual. Why would she come with an instruction manual? Crap. - Man. - What's the matter, Mr. Campbell? Nothing. I had some drinks this morning. Damn it! Do you have any... Hey, Mr. Officer. - Hi, Calvin. - Hey, Mitch, how you doing? Good, good. What's... Wha... what's going on here? Well... I'm just...

Well, good luck at your baseball meeting tonight. - Thanks, bud. - You're welcome. - Have fun at church. - Thanks. All right, so who is she? Who? This friend you've been spending all this time with. The market, church. Who is she and can I please see a picture? t's not a lady. I've been hanging out with that kid, Produce. - The retarded kid? - Hey, easy. It's called Down Syndrome. I'll tell you something, you spend a second with this kid and you realize he's just like you and me. You're a genius. What's guaranteed to make people spend money? The mentally handicapped... challenged, whatever you call it. That's what I need for my new dealership commercial. Like you're gonna give money to the Special Olympics or something every time you sell a car? - What are you talking about? - No, you tool bag. I want him to star in my commercial. It's perfect. Come on, Milt. Okay, maybe not him, maybe one of his special buddies will do it. - Hey, conversation's over. - Cal. Come on, man, sales are down. Do your old buddy Milt a solid and call the kid. He won't know the difference. Maybe he'll do it for free. You know, he's retarded. Hey! I said it's Down Syndrome. Okay, what are you... you feeling sorry for him? No, Milt, I feel sorry for you. B.S., man, you feel sorry for yourself. You've been feeling sorry for yourself since Detroit kicked you off the team. - What'd you just say to me? - You heard every word I said. I'm not gonna sit here and debate some loser who can't get over the fact that he was an embarrassment in the majors. What, are you gonna freeze? Is your whole life just gonna freeze? Just like you did at home plate? Mr. Campbell! Where are you? Hey! What are you doing up there?! Produce, you scared me. Come on. Hey, watch your step, Produce. There's all sorts of... There's just stuff. Did you drink that whole bottle? Not yet. Now I did. Are you sure that you are okay, Mr. Campbell? I'm okay. Now that you're here, I'm great. I got my drinking buddy. Maybe we can go to the batting cages and be baseball buddies, not drinking buddies? You wanna be my baseball buddy? - Yeah, I do. - Okay. Here. First lesson... ...when you make it to the majors... 'cause you will... and you're standing at the home plate and there's 40,000 people... cheering for you, expecting anything... don't forget to swing the bat. I know that, Mr. Campbell. You knew that. You know everything? You're a smart guy. Okay, answer me this... who hit the ball 400 feet on to the roof of Stevenson High School when he was a junior? Was it you, Mr. Campbell? Well, it wasn't you, was it? - No, it wasn't me. - No, it wasn't you. Yeah, it was me. It was me. I was supposed to be great. Well, to me, I think you're great. Well, of course you do! Of course you do. You think melons are great. - I don't like it when you drink. - You know what? I don't like it when you drink and I don't want to be your drinking buddy and I don't want to be your baseball buddy. Do you understand me? I don't want to be your buddy anymore. I'm sorry. I have a meeting I gotta go to at 6:00 tonight. It's, like, a really big meeting... with really big... big, important people. Hey. Toss 'em up. I don't think that you should drive. God, toss up the keys, Produce. I'll call Miss Katie to pick you up. - Produce... - I'll call Miss Katie to pick you up. I'm gonna come down there, Produce. - No! - Co... come here! Come here! Man, Produce. Produce. Hey! Hey! Produce! Hey. If I'm late... I'm walking and if I'm late, it's your fault. It's your fault! Hello? It's Calvin Campbell. I'm here for my interview! I'm late! Come on! Open the door! Hey. Hey! Come on! Come on! You were supposed to call me right after the meeting, Dad. Katie, it's Officer Minniear. - Is everything okay? - Everything's fine. - It's, just... - What happened? We found him passed out in the visitors' dugout at South, so I need you to come down here and pick him up. Here, drink this. Cal, come on. Drink this. - Thanks, Mitch. - How you feeling? I don't feel good. Katie. No, don't touch me, Calvin! I'm sorry. This is the single most embarrassing moment of my life. Do you have any idea what it's like picking up the man who calls himself your father at the police station drunk as hell? - I'm sorry. - No, you're not. You're not sorry. You're just a pathetic little man. You're a pathetic little man who lives a pathetic little life. - Don't say that. - Because it's not true? Because you know it is. I'm sorry. This isn't how I wanted things to turn out, Katie. I just want to make sure you know that I've given up on you. Katie, come on. Your old man's had a rough night. Don't say that to me, Katie, 'cause you're my little girl. - I'm sorry. - Get in the car. Mitch, Mitch... Mitch, I'm sorry. It's okay. You can... you can yell at me, you can scream if you want to. I deserve it. Why would I do that? I already told you I've given up on you. What can I do to make this better? You tell me what to do, Katie. What can I do? Nothing. Katie. Produce. Hi, Mr. Campbell. Hey, kid. Did you make it to your meeting? No. No, I didn't. Yeah, it's probably better that you did not go. You... you're probably right. So, are you still mad at me for taking your keys? No. So, are you here to shop for groceries? Come here. I'm sorry. God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Come on in. Sorry. Hi, I'm Amy, and I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Amy. Tonight's meeting is a closed meeting. Anyone who has a desire to stop drinking is welcome to stay. Any newcomers? Please stand up and introduce yourself. We'd like to welcome you. Um... Hi... My name is Calvin Campbell. And... I live here, St. Matthews. And, um... I have a daughter. She's 17. who I... I love her more than anything. And, um... Yeah, that's about it. - Hi, Calvin. - Hi, Calvin. Hi. Thank you. Um, just for future, first name only is fine. That's kind of the anonymous part. And, um... it's customary to state that you're an alcoholic. That part is... self-explanatory. All right, tonight I'll be reading from step three. "Made a decision to turn our will and lives over to the care of God as we understood Him." What? Do you love me, Colt? You don't love me. Why would you even say that? If you loved me, we'd be in the backseat right now and I'd be hitting it. Prick. What did you just say to me? - Nothing. - All right, get out of my car, Katie. What? I'm not doing this baby stuff with you anymore. I'm over it, all right? Get out. - You know what? You are a prick. - Yeah, and you know what? You're not hot enough for me to be trying this hard anymore. Get out. - Hello? - Hey. - Hey, you okay? - Will you come pick me up? - Yeah. - I-I would have called someone else, but... - I'm behind the Valumarket. - What are you doing there? Well, Colt wanted to go somewhere that we could be alone. I... just please come get me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm coming to get you right now. I'll be right there. - Hey, Miss Katie. - Hi, Produce. I probably look silly just standing out here all by myself in the dark. Are you cold? Yeah, but won't you be cold? No. Thank you. I think you look beautiful. - Well, you're very sweet. - You're welcome. Produce, listen to me. I need you to go back inside, okay? Produce, go back inside. - What are you doing here? - No, leave him alone. He didn't do anything. Listen, I don't care about the 'tard, I'm talking to you. I came back to apologize, Katie. I'm sorry for what I said earlier. Damn, you drunk again, Mr. Campbell? - You touch either one of them... - You'll what? Go home. - We're over, Colt. Okay. Fine. Have it your way. Hey. Thanks for coming. I'm trying, Katie. - I'm trying. - I know. - Thanks, Dad. - And you... thank you for protecting my daughter. You're welcome. I wish there was something we could do to repay you. - I'm so glad - That troubles don't Troubles don't last always - I'm so glad - I'm so glad Troubles don't - Troubles don't last always - O Lord, what should I do? - O Lord, what should I do? I said that I... I'm certain that... We're gonna leave in a couple of minutes. So what did you guys think of the service? Well, I mean, she liked it. She was smiles and, I liked it. Think you guys will make it back? I don't know. You know? It's been a long time since I've darkened the doorway of a... Of a church? Yeah, of a church. I just... you know. I haven't had much faith in anything in a long time. I hear you. - Yeah. - How's everything else been going? Um... One day at a time. That's right. Hey, um, can we... can I take you to get some coffee or... - Um... - Yeah. Yeah, you got coffee. - Hey, Katie. - You ready to go? I am. Katie, this is Miss Amy. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - It's really nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Well, hopefully all good. - Sometimes. - Thanks. - Definitely all good. - Thank you. Okay. - Okay. - All right. - Bye. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Come on, Dad. - Come back. - We will. - I'll see you later. You swing with your club face open. What do you know? You swing a club worse than you swing a bat. Did you just come here to mock my golf game? I came here to apologize. Cal, the things I said to you, man, everything I said... Hey, what you said was true and I needed to hear it. - Missed you, buddy. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - You should be sorry. - It was a cheap shot. Let's get out of here. Let's get a beer. How about we make it a coffee? - A coffee? - AA. You're not an alcoholic, Cal. I am. I'm an alcoholic. Okay, happy hour. Two for one. Two for me, none for you. - Hey, Dexter. - Hey, what's up, Calvin? How you doing? So today is the day that you announce the Employee of the Month, right? - Yeah, why? - Well, um, have you considered Produce? - He's a hard worker. - Now, Cal, I have a soft spot - in my heart for that young man. - Yeah, I know. That's why I hired him the first time. He's a good boy. He's a good guy. Now... now, look, Cal. Now, Produce ain't got the sense God gave a cucumber. - Now, I gotta give that award to employee that represent what this supermarket is about. This ain't no YMCA where everybody gets a trophy. Okay, and with all due respect, I think that Produce is probably the hardest-working employee that you have. I mean he knows the name and the SKU number, the code or whatever to every piece of fruit and vegetable over in your... - Now, Cal. - ...section over there. Just because the boy's a retard, he don't get no special treatment. - You know better than that, man. - You know what? We don't use the "R" word just like we don't use the "N" word. You know? We should be clear on our word choice, Dexter. Let's get out of here. Hey. Wanna go have some fun? Let's go. Well, do you guys wanna hit the go-karts? - Go-karts? Do we? - Yeah! I'll do the go-karts. We were made to hit the go-karts, Produce. Made. Born to ride! Good morning, sunshine It's nice to see you up Once in a while It's 12:00 already The city bus is gone, you're late again But I'll give you a ride I know you don't like it when I tell you how to live But something's gotta give Life, love, and pain Life, love, and pain. There you go. You're making this hard on me, Milt. Come on, don't be soft. They call that enabling. It's called testing. Good job, you passed. These are actually both for me. - Where's your family at? - Franklin's dropping them off. Yeah. We're playing house. All right, give me a sip. - Really? - Yeah, just a sip, a taste, to knock off the edge. Are you sure about this? One sip. I've been real, real good. Come on. I may have lost my drinking buddy, but I still gotta look out for my best friend. Besides, the beer was terrible. Tasted stale. - Did it? - No. I just remembered I had this. I don't want a sip of that. Yeah. Look who we found, Mr. Campbell. Produce wanted me to come have pizza with him. Um... - Amy. - Hi, I'm Milt Malcolm. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - How are you? Nice to meet you. Nice work. Cavalry has arrived. Excuse me, folks. See ya, buddy. All right, come on, let's go. - Let's go. - Come on. I'll be right there. Thank you so much. It means a lot. I... I'm sorry. Milt. Milt! Listen, that... that wasn't anything... I'm not listening to you! You're killing me. You're killing me! Hey, Produce, you want to go play some games? - Yeah! - Yeah? - Bye. - See ya later. - Wait... - Ha. - Wait... - We just got ditched. Yeah, I think your daughter just stole him from me. - Hi. - How you doing? I'm good, yeah. Nice. Come on, go get a pizza. - Pizza. - Talking your language? That's unique. I know how to do this. I love laser tag. Thanks. Hey! We're on the same team, remember? Hey, Katie. Come on. - I wanna play. - No, we can play later. Come on, guys, it's the last game of the night. Then we can come back tomorrow. We're on the same team, remember? I'll protect you. My gosh, you got me, man. Come on, guys. It's just a silly game of laser tag. - Come on, Katie, let's beat 'em! - Let's go. - What? - What do you need to be so rude for, Katie? - What does that mean? - Remember? Remember you used to say you loved me? - No, Colt. What are you doing? - Once upon a time. - I just wanna talk, that's all. - Okay, well, I don't wanna talk. - Yeah, you don't need to talk. - No, you need to put your hands off me. No, no, listen, I just want you to lay back down right now. - That's it. - You're disgusting. - Disgusting? - No, my dad was right about you. - My God. - Stop! - Stop! Get off! - Shh! This would be easier if you just... - Hey, I shot you guys! - Get out of here, Produce. No! Is that Miss Katie? - Get out of here! - Shut up, Katie! - No! - Now! Shut up! Will you shut up? Shut up. Come on, shut up! - Dad! - Yeah? Dad, please come help. Hurry! What's wrong, baby? What's wrong? Produce hit Colt and it's really bad. What? No. Hey, should you call 911? Yeah. What did you do, Produce? - You're not proud of me? - No, I'm not proud of you! You cannot hit somebody with a fire extinguisher! I mean, are you... are you crazy?! I thought we'd be like brothers! You go call your mom right now! And you bring her here, Produce. Dad, it wasn't his fault. He was just trying to protect me from Colt. - Wh... what do you mean? - I don't know what would have happened if he didn't... Baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Now is he gonna be all right? Once he gets treated, we'll take him in and interview him, find out a little bit more about what happened. - Okay. - Where's the kid? Obviously, we'll need to talk to him. We don't know. Um, he just took off. Okay, I'll send some officers to... to go look for him. Is he gonna be in trouble? Produce? I don't foresee that. I think it's... we just need to ask him some questions. Find out a little bit more about... about what went on. All right, well, it's my fault, so I'm gonna get in the car and I'm just gonna go look for him. All right, I'm gonna stay here and see if I can get ahold of him. - Okay. - Okay, I'll go with you. - Thank you, Officer. - Certainly. - Let us know if you find out anything. - Absolutely. We can't just be driving around blindly looking for him all night. - We have no choice. - Yeah, we do. I think I'm gonna take you home. Maybe just wait for him there. Maybe he'll show up at the house. No, he's not gonna show up at the house, Dad. And I'd rather be with you right now. What does Milt want? Hey, buddy boy, what do you need? Let's meet up, man. Let's meet up. No, I can't right now. Katie and I are looking for Produce. - We're just driving around. - I talked with him. - Can't do that right now. - Frank, he said he wasn't sleeping with her. She wanted to. I believe him, man. Jeez! Hey! Milt? Hey, answer me! Milt! Hey. Hey, Amy. Hey, is Produce okay? No, not good. - Are you his father? - No. Dr. Jones wants to speak to his next of kin to discuss what's going to be happening today. All right, we'll call his mother. No, she died over a year ago. What? He talks about her all the time. I know. I'm... I'm so sorry. I thought you knew. Ho... ho... hold on a second. So you're telling me that he lives all on his own? Even... even with his... with... with his condition? Yeah. Does that really surprise you? The patient with DS is... really wants a book or his book... You know what? Let me talk to him. I'll talk to him. I'm sorry. I'm only allowed to have family back there. - Please. - Ma'am, we are the only family that he has. - Okay? Amy, do you mind sticking with Katie? - Yeah. - I got it. Thank you. - Where is he? Thank you very much. Hey. Hey. Hey, buddy. How you doing, Produce? Hey, Produce, how you doing? - Hurts so bad. - Yeah. I bet you do. Hey, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. Okay? Back at that laser tag place, I... I realize you were just trying to protect Katie. I just wanted to say thank you. You're welcome, Mr. Campbell. I'm sorry, Cal. - I want to have my book. - You want your book? Yes. - You want your book? - Yes. You want your book! I'm gonna go get your book. I'll be right back. Hey. Your wife's on her way. - Hey, darling. - Hey, Dad. Hey, sweetheart, will you run to the car real quick and grab Produce's Bible for me? - Hi. How are you doing? - I'm fine. Fine. - You okay? - I'm fine. I just saw Milt. He looks good. He's gonna be all right. Wanna go back and see him? Actually, um, I'm not sure he wants to see me. Okay. I mean, I think... I think that he would wanna see you. You sure? You know, I don't wanna get him all worked up. - Okay. - So... Okay. Okay. You okay? Yeah. Hey, here's the book I got that you asked for. It's not for me. What are you... what are you talking about? It's for him. We're looking at blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen, ruptured spleen, severe internal bleeding, and hypertension. Should I order an exploratory laparotomy? No time. Make sure we're prepped for a splenectomy, stat. I don't wanna lose this kid. Okay. Mr. Campbell. You're gonna be all right, kid, I promise. Please don't leave me here. Hey, I'm right here, Milt. I'm right here, pal. Look what the kid gave you. - He's a good kid. - Yeah. - I'm scared, Cal. - Hey, hey. You're gonna be all right. My mom used to do that back when I was a kid... read me the Bible. I used to like Matthew. I can't remember why. Hey, Sue? Come on. All right. Pick up. "...who are weary and burdened. and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me. - For I am gentle and humble in heart..." - We need to get him - into surgery now. - "...and you will find rest..." Give me another set of retractors. I see some bleeding in the left kidney. Get two units of blood, stat! More suction! - There you go. - Bring that in closer. Hey, thanks. What did you say? - When? - When you prayed. I don't know. I said a prayer, too. That was the first time I've actually prayed. Yeah? Me, too. I-I asked that Milt and Produce will be okay. - Do you think it'll happen? - I hope so. I hope so. But I don't know if that's the way it works, sweetheart. Well, then, what good is it to pray if you don't get what you ask for? Okay. Growing up, did I get you everything that you ever asked for? - Of course not. - No. But I love you so much and I want you to have everything that you want, but sometimes it's not in your best interest or it's just... it's just a hard decision. It's not fair. I'm saying that God... is probably not a genie... you know, that's granting every wish or... I don't know. I don't know. Maybe you're right. I hope that you get what you asked for tonight. Thanks, Dad. He's crashing! Come on! Doctor, get that off of the paper. Get two units of blood! Probing. Where's the CO2? You know, it's in moments like these I'm reminded of one profound truth. Life is short. And it's meant to be lived with courage and not laden with fear. And you have to decide are your dreams bigger than your memories? Or will you stay stuck in the past? Life is meant to be lived. Lived abundantly. You know, you look around this cemetery, you see there are... there are two dates on every tombstone. There's a birthdate and there is a date of death. Every human being is guaranteed those two dates, but that little dash that lies in between those two numbers, that's what defines our life. So make your dash count. Live. Really live. Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome our new Louisville Bats manager, Calvin Campbell, who will now take the mound to throw out the first pitch. Wow. I want to dedicate this first pitch to someone very important to me, who's not able to be here with us tonight because... well... his life ended way too soon. Produce... can I have a ball, please? Yeah! Ha-ha! That's my boy! Ha-ha! - Knock 'em down, man. - Thanks. This one's for Milt. Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce! Produce, where the heck have you been? I don't know. Good morning, sunshine It's nice to see you up Once in a while It's 12:00 already The city bus is gone, you're late again But I'll give you a ride I know you don't like it when I tell you how to live But something's gotta give So let it out, you gotta move on Before you lose all you love And have to start over again Maybe that's how you'll learn about Life, love, and pain You say you're dry now But to me it looks like rain And I don't want to see you Get soaked all over again... Dead man walking You're stumbling down the street At half past 3:00 Sooner or later you'll find the police And they'll find me Now I can understand If you don't know who you are And where you wanna go My impatience is starting to show So pick it up, pack it all on You better start soon or I'll be gone I'm not gonna wait Maybe that's how you'll learn about Life, love, and pain You say you're dry now But to me it looks like rain And I don't want to see you Get soaked all over again Life, love, and pain Life, love, and pain Life, love, and pain Life, love, and pain Life, love, and pain Life, love, and pain Life, love, and pain Life, love, and pain. My heart holds a question between every beat Got every answer beneath my feet Fallin' apart, but I never know why I've walked every road but the one that's right Been chasin' my tail instead of my dream Life's just a game, but you play it for keeps The world is kind, the world is cruel The world you find depends on you When did I stop believin'? Wake me from this sleep Wake me from this sleep Save me from these dreams When did I stop believin'? I guess I'm alive, but I tend to forget I remember the taste and this isn't it My heart holds a question, I don't have a clue It's strange we forget everything we knew.
