And the money. You know what, keep it. - All of it? - Yeah. You need it more than I do. You fighters from around the world have been invited to train with master Po. And witness the impossible. Now, you might think that master Po has run out of the unthinkable. But he'd like to challenge himself and stay creative. And continue to inspire you all with an infinite imagination. Check it out! The universe is composed of particles. Which are subjected to the power of the focus. Quiet mind. Again I say! Check it out! And can I get an amen? Amen! That's what I'm talking about. The fight will begin. Unless first, somebody wanna challenge master Po. You mean to tell me there's nobody here Batshit crazy enough to go a couple rounds with the master? - Can I get another amen? - Amen! Let's fight. The next round we will add weapons. You come here to kill me? Sloane. Your brother was brave, your brother was a warrior. Unlike you. Such a coward. Come to my home with a gun to kill me in my sleep. Ladies and gentlemen my brother Eric Sloane, world champion. Come on, you do it. - We're gonna do this? - Absolutely. Alright. One more time, one more time. Ready? I need a drink. - I'm gonna get some wine. - Well, look who it is. What brings you to this side of town? Here to see the fabulous Eric Sloane. - You look great. - Thank you. You've made a quiet a name for yourself. I'm working on it. Almost a modern day warrior. Almost. Heard you won the gold. Yeah, I did. So, what's next? I don't know. Probably expand the gym, get some new equipment. Well, I have an idea. I bet you do my dear. You're gonna have to talk to Kurt because he's my manager now as well as my trainer. Always looking out for baby brother, - I love that about you. - Taking care of him? Are you kidding me, he takes care of me. This kid always pushes me in the right direction, and pulls me with no strings attached unlike - some people in this game. - Hm. Right. So, who wants to go to Thailand? Jesus, can you give a guy a moment of victory? We're having a party here. - I'm talking immortality. - Immortality. - No rules, no ref. Just your wit and skill to keep you alive. What do you mean no rules? No wait, I heard about these underground fights over here, but, uh, what's in it for us? Well 200k right now. And 200 when you land. And the chance to be remembered for a lifetime. Alright, now we're talking. Keep going. I've got this fighter by the name of tong Po. He's an undefeated Muay Thai champ. And I think you can take it, and make us all a ton of cash while doing so. Kurt, wanna go to Thailand? You know what let's talk about it later. Let's have a drink! It's a party! Just don't let her get into your head. It's not her getting into my head, have you ever seen this kind of cash before? We could buy this place and be set for life. Eric, if you decline it's okay. It's not for everyone. She comes in, looks at you, smiles at you, and you fall into her trap? She's a crook! She's a fight promoter Kurt, they're all crooks. Our job is to get as much cash load as we can while I'm on top. You don't know what you're walking into. Jesus Christ, Kurt, you're driving me crazy with this already. You know that Thai champ should be worried about me. I'm a badass, you know that? Stop being a coward. I'm looking out for you and your career. No, stay here and do what you do best, just worry. You really think you can take the Thai champ at his sport? Are you that arrogant? Well, I know you don't, so I guess I'll be doing this alone. Thanks for the party. - You're just gonna walk away? - I'm walking toward a future. Hey, Kurt! Kurt! You got something from Eric. - He's fighting in a week. His gold medal? I gotta go to Thailand. Get up! Come on! Eric! Get out! Eric! Eric! I'm so sorry. Kurt. - You set him up. - We got him the best trainer. He trained his ass off. Eric knew what he was getting himself into. Sometimes these things just happen. You killed him! This is on you. This is all on you! I'm just gonna say goodbye and then I'll leave. Taking care of him? Are you kidding me, he takes care of me. This kid always pushes me in the right direction and pulls me with no strings attached. Who's this? I think this is your brother's trainer. I think he may have something for you. Do you mind? I'm training him. Are you Durand? - Yes I am. - This is Eric's brother. - Here. This is Eric's fee for his fight. He wanted you to have this. If anything happened to him. And of course, it did. You're making a joke. - Do I look like I'm laughing? You trained my brother Muay Thai? Yes I did. Why would you let him fight that monster? I train people. I don't tell them when to fight and who to fight. You didn't train him well enough, did you? We have to go. Kurt! Let's go! I'm putting you on a plane out of the country. If you stay, come back, you will go to jail. You get it? Oh, Mr. Sloane. We normally would welcome you to master Po's humble home, but it's clear that you're here with dubious intentions. But when Michael Corleone was sitting in the restaurant across from the two man who attempted to kill his father, many argued that he was wrestling with his conscious to whether or not he could kill them in cold blood. I however believe that the decision were made the night he visited his father. And saw him barely alive in the hospital. He had no choice really. He had to pull the trigger. And as for you Mr. Sloane, all you had to do was pull the trigger. I should have. You're coming with me. By going after tong Po like that, you made things very hard on yourself. And on my investigation. You're the only eye witness wiling to come forward and now you're credibility's gonna be questioned. Credibility? Hi-ya! I guess I should thank you for saving my life. I'm the one that put you there. You know I have orders to arrest you? What about those guys in the street? We'll take care of them. In the meantime your brother's trainer has agreed to shelter you here. - When did that happen? - It's just for a few days. Train me to fight tong Po. I failed Eric. What am I gonna do with you? You're gonna help me make this right. I will train you. We wake up at five. No coffee break. - What's going on? - Forgot to numb the nerves. Shh. Oh, my god. - What? - What are those from? - Training. What kind of training does that to you? Training with Durand. Why are you putting yourself through that? When I'm training, when I'm in that place the pain just turns my brain off. I don't feel anything. That's good. How do you feel? - You're crazy. - I'm crazy? One more time. Just give me a minute to catch my breath. Why would you do that? Do you think tong Po would give you a break? Splits? We have more to do. - You look tired. - Are you tired? - He gets tired so easy. - Why don't you rest? - He won't let me. Let's have a coconut break. - Coconuts! - Coconut break! You like coconuts? You're supposed to try to crack open the coconuts. Let me show you. Kurt. I'm ready Durand. - You're ready? - I am ready. See? I am ready. Oh. You think you're ready? Let's get a drink. Oh, he was unlucky wasn't he? - Huh? Is there anyone that can beat my fighter? Five thousand baht. If you can last two rounds gets you 50,000 baht. Anyone? Anyone? Aw. Master Durand. - Lovely to see you again mate. Ah, you've brought me some more easy money have ya? I'm just messing with ya. Joseph king by name. - Joe king by nature, huh? Eh, looks stuck up this one, yeah? - Yeah. - What can I do for ya? Two rounds. Your funeral. - 5,000, two rounds? - That's right. - With him? - You're ready, no? This way. Like I said before, just stay put. You cannot leave this compound. Do you understand? It's just not safe for you out there. Just come by anytime, I'll be right here. Wait a second, you said he was in training. Training for what exactly? I'm a trainer. That's what I do. You stay away from tong Po. I'll keep him busy. Don't worry. And just stay put, okay? Don't make me bring you an ankle bracelet. Great distraction. And not a distraction. What are you doing here? They kicked me out. He's from tong Po's camp. Please, come. Just go for a second, I need to talk to him. Why did you come here? Maybe you came here to get a reward from the cops, right? Or maybe you came here because of your master, tong Po. - Look, master Durand. - Yes? Maybe... maybe you should have trained Eric better. Tell me the truth. Okay, I work for tong Po. Now you work for me. And Kurt. - How am I gonna get paid? - Get paid? You will keep your teeth. Laundry. Stop drinking and start to train. You're good. Not impressed by your performance. Never gonna win going back. Tighter. Tighter. Yeah, that's good. Come from the inside. Push up the chin. Hands up, break hard. If you're afraid to die in a fight with tong Po, you're dead. I don't want to lose two sons. Tong Po's head. Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po! Come on, tong Po! Tong Po! I challenge you to a fight! Storm! Let's go, bring it. Master Po has gladly accepted your challenge. Be prepared. Master Po has gladly accepted your challenge. Eric's little brother wants revenge. A grudge match. Tong Po! I challenge you to a fight! Huh? Wattona, darling? What seems to be the problem? Your place is compromised. Do you know what we could do with this information knowing that she's listening? We could send her to a much better place for us. It's been her crusade for years. Without her, none of this would be happening. Without her, doesn't that sound ideal? You want it clean or messy? Make her an example. You don't have to do this. This is for your own good. You're both under arrest. You're a fugitive. You're harboring a fugitive. Love and Muay Thai don't mix. So your girlfriend won't let you fight tong Po. We have to get out of here. Okay. Vous parlez francais? Hey. Forgot about me? Hey! Sorry. Hey! Come on! Whoops. Let's go. Just let everyone know initial bets can be placed before the first round. No betting during fight time. A man's strength in Muay Thai is not just his destructive capacity. There are often 30 to 50 deaths in the ring each year. One of those deaths occurred not so long ago. Right here on this spot. Another will occur today, right here. Let's meet the challenger! Kurt Sloane. The brother of the last man who died by tong Po's hand. His fury over the death of his brother has led to one attempt at tong Po's life. He wants revenge so much that he broke out of jail just to be here with us today and face his formidable enemy in mortal combat! Ladies and gentlemen, the undisputed champion of all champions, the man who defies the laws of physics. The man who is responsible for more than half the deaths in the ring in the last two years, usually in the first round. - I give you tong Po! Tong Po! Tong Po, tong Po, tong Po! Tong Po, tong Po, tong Po! Tong Po, tong Po, tong Po... You know what to do. Don't think about anything else. That champion's amulet has been around his neck for too long. Now you have the spirit of Muay Thai in you and he's going down. Fighters! The rounds will be progressive, weapons will be added, chosen by me. But the first round is only on the eight points of contact. Ready to die... After you. Back to your corner! Champion! Challenger. Fight! Come on, up. Is it done? Half of 'em lined up. Anyone betting on Kurt? Couple of guys went for the odds. Just about three mil on tong Po. I'm gonna have Po stretch it out a round, even the odds. Sit down. You're doing well. What fight are you watching? This one, come on. You're doing exactly what I want, okay? You're doing very well. Surprise, surprise, surprise. The challenger is still alive. So let's up the ante. Second stanza, glass. Place your bets. Tong Po, tong Po, tong Po... Come on, get up. Again. Sit down. Okay. - How you doing? - Not good. Remember, he's just a man. Like you, his bones can break and he can bleed. Now go in there and take that son of a bitch out. Come on. Let's go. You're under arrest. Look, you should really check this out before you do something stupid. I've got some juice down in Metro. Yeah, I know all about it. It'll come out in prosecution. I'll be out in a day. I am in a state of shock, Sloane's heart is still beating. He's proven himself a worthy opponent for master Po. And with that we move into our final round, and the weapons shall be our double swords. Death is imminent. Fight! Get up. The swords. Get up! Your brother was brave. Your brother was a warrior. Unlike you, such a coward. If you're afraid to die in a fight with tong Po, you're dead. I don't want to lose two sons. You don't have to do this. Come on. You're a warrior and he's going down. Come on. That's my boy. Coconut. Again, coconut! Come on. - Yeah! This is for Eric. Eh!
