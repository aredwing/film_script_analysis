Remember, we're in America. - Son, your Uncle Mack is gonna trip. - Phew! Oh! Man, when I first left Caruthersville... - all I had was a $50 Grimley and a Jheri curl. - Oh! - Look at me now. Pushin' a fully loaded... - Oh! Brand-new Lincoln Navigator. Come on, Dad. Compared to these trucks... - yours is wack. - What? - I'm just sayin'. Don't get all mad at me. - Come on. I mean, these are nice cars out here. You got your Ferrari, your Lotus, but it's no Lincoln. That's what I'm saying. Hello, man. Welcome to 310 Motoring. - How may I help ya? - I'm Nate Johnson. Is my truck ready? Oh, Nate. Yes, it is, man. You're the insurance guy. I remember your truck. Oh, snap! Hey. Yo, that's Kurupt. I sent him my demo tape, like, two weeks ago. Just act like you're my bodyguard. Look. - Hey, and if he come over... - What? Just call me M.C. "D" to theJizz-A. - Yeah, Dad. - Call you who to the Wizz-A? I named you Divernius James... After your granddaddy. Plus that street name stuff isn't marketable. This rap thing, son, there's no future in it. There's no pension, no 401 plan... and obviously no dental. That's why they all have those gold teeth. Oh! Dad, come on. Dad, come on.! That's what I call a fully loaded 'Gator for the haters. The platinum grille, Burberry interior. Hydraulic switches, three-wheel motion, and look at the wheels. Oh, boy. Son, all that Crenshaw crap kills the resale. Now, what self-respecting lawyer or doctor would drive this thing now? - Dr. Dre. - Boy, he ain't no real doctor. Come here now. Look, son. My car will be your car in... three, four or five, six... seven, eight, nine, 10 years... and I don't want you thuggin' it up. But, Dad, then why are we here? We're here to install my Delco eight-track tape player... so I can listen to my music on the trip. Listen, if you wanted to go old-school... you should have had them install your record player. Boy, you know, those videos got your head all mixed up. - Now, back in my day... - Yeah, right. You couldn't have just two hit songs and call yourself having a good record. No, no, no. The whole album had to be good. You just put it on, let it play. Wasn't no skip buttons. Wasn't like that mess you listen to today. All that "rub me" and "lick me" and "suck me. " Gotta wear a condom just to listen to some of it. Oh. Oh. No, no, no, no. - Tell me this is not my truck. - It is, insurance man. Beautiful, isn't it? This truck has everything. It has TVs in the floors and the headrest... a Nike air bag, even new 26-inch rims just approved for public use. Not by me. The only thing I approved was an eight-track. Now, where is it? Oh, the Delco. It must have been a mix-up... uh, made by my brother who we fired yesterday. Well, imagine that, Ziggy Marley. Now, I suggest you get that junk off my truck right now... before I flip you upside-down and mop the floor with ya! Wait, don't. Shh, shh. Don't be so violent. Calm down. I can't just take it off. It's... It's gonna take about... - Three days. - Uh, no. Three? Three days? No, no, no, no. In three days I've gotta be in Missouri... which means I'm on the I-10 by 10:00. But no worries. Just take it... and bring it back exactly how it is. - No charge. - Whoa. Better not be no charge to me. Look, what about my eight-track? Oh, it has eight-track, nine-track, 10-track. It's a C.D. Player. Don't worry, boss man. Your ride will glide. Yeah! Dad. Look. Look. Yeah! Up, up. Down. Yeah! Real smooth! Oh! This don't make no sense. D.J., how do you turn this thing off? Everybody's lookin' at us. What's up, baby? Hey, this is hot, huh? No, no, no. Yo, Dad, look. Look. It's goin' up, up. But here's the fun part. Los Angeles to... Caruthersville, Missouri. Los Angeles to Caruthersville. Distance: 1,888.9 miles. That's all I need is another woman telling me what to do. Ooh, girl, you wanna know my perfect outfit? I'm thinking J. Lo's jeans. You know the ones she had at the MTVAwards. No, no, no. But Eve's top at the A.M.A.'s, that was hot. I would rock that. Open the door. Tried that. Here. Use this. Hold on. - Hello. - Nikki, open the door. Nikki, let your sister get her dog stuff. Okay. Hmm. Your father was supposed to be here finish packing and change that outfit. Ah! Don't you answer that phone. Whoever it is can call when you get back. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. - Did you see that? - Yeah. - Dad, did you see that? - Yeah, I saw that. Oh, shoot. Boy, give me the phone. Phone ain't for you. Upstairs, D.J. Hello. Hey, Mama. No. - I told you. We'll be there in three days. - I'm surprised. 'Cause Miss Uppity makes you back out every year. I don't know why that woman doesn't like me. Come on, Mama. You did throw cooked rice at our weddin'. Is that woman even coming? Yeah. She is, uh, packing right now. Hold on, son. Your brother Mack just got here with one of those flat-screen TVs. - Hey, Mama. - You're always thinkin' about your mama. - All the time, girl. - Set it right there between J.F.K. And Jesus. Hello. Mack got you a plasma TV? I don't know. Is that what you call it? Here. Talk to your brother. All right. Hey, little bro. What's goin' on? Hey, man. What happened to the 35-inch I just sent Mama? Ah, don't worry about it. She, uh... She usin' it. You ain't plannin' on comin' down here... and winning my Family of the Year trophy, are you? Man, what trophy? Don't know anything about no trophy. I'm just trying to bring my fam down there so we can see Mama. That's it. Well, well, that's real thoughtful of you, baby bro... seein' as how you ain't been here in four years. What you tryin' to say, Mack? Tryin' to start somethin'? No, no, no. I ain't tryin' to start nothin'. It's just that you ain't been here in so long... kind of make me think you're tryin' to hide somethin'. You do remember the rules, don't you? - You can't win Family of the Year if you ain't a family. - I know. - So, I strongly suggest... if you want to win yourself a trophy or somethin'... you ought to start coaching yourself a Little League team. My little brother Nate. Uh-huh. Hey, Mama. Hey, look. I know he didn't hang up. Hello? All right. All right. Yo, Dad. Look, um, I'm really tired, going back and forth. I mean, we gotta go all the way over there... and then we gotta go all the way over here. - And then we gotta go all the way... - All right. I get it. Look, things are gonna be okay. If they weren't, we wouldn't be goin' on this trip together. Your mother and I are gonna work things out. - Don't worry. Okay? - All right. Cool. All right, buckle up. Lock your door. Close your vent. - Yeah, Dad. All right. - Don't touch the radio. - I said don't touch the radio. - My bad. Dorothy, Nikki, let's go! Son, you wanna learn how to drive? - For sure. Let's go. - Give me your hand. Here's your first lesson. Let's go! Calm down, Nate. We'll be out in a minute. Let's go. Oh, no. Don't even think about it. Dang, Dad. Man, what would I do without my Mike Tyson grill? "Tastes so good, it'll bite you back. " - Let me go get these women. - Yeah, do that. Ladies, come on. Let's go. We gotta be on the I-10 by 10:00. And it's 9:42. Let's roll. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't tell me you are bringing your schoolwork on this trip. Yes. I have a test when I get back. - Why don't you study when we get back? - Help me with the bags, please. D.J., help your mother with her bags. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What? You're runnin' like you stole something. Say hello. - Hello, sweetie. - Hey, Ma. You mean you gotta do this... Yeah, you're right. My belly button is way better than Beyonc's. What? Now, see, you've gone a little far now. I ain't puttin' chocolate syrup in it. - No. - Get off that phone and change. - Thank you. - That was the quarterback. You're living under my roof, play by my rules. - No boys on the phone. - You're acting like Dad. - No boys stopping by all hours. Don't roll your eyes. - He's a quarterback. - That's right. - Cell phone. I didn't want you to have a cell phone in the first place. Your father's idea. Y'all are arguing about the wrong thing. Who made the sandwiches for the trip, and did you go by Food Club... and get the big thing of planters Cheez Balls like I like 'em? Nate, you see what she's wearing? Actually, both y'all need to change. You know my mama don't like pink. Nate. "Cheez Balls. " Daddy, I made this outfit myself. You need to get upstairs and finish making the rest of it. - But it took me... - But nothin'. Nikki, I am your father. I know what's best for you, and that's go change. L-10 by 10:00. Let's go, people. - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, cutie. - And how are you? - Good. You? Ah, you look so nice. You ready for the trip? Yep. Nate, what happened to your car? It looks like a purse on wheels. Then you should feel right at home. - Damn. - Oh, there you go, son. You know, if that rapping thing doesn't work out, you'll make one hell of a bellboy. Go ahead. All right, sweetie. Let's get you in the car. All right. Upsy-goesy. Okay. Better. All right. Remember, baby girl. I have a very special birthday party planned for you at Bun World. Yea! Wait, Daddy. Don't leave Sir Barks-A-Lot. He's going to miss my birthday. Sweetie, there is no dog, okay? Nate, get the dog. There. - There you go. - Thanks, Dad. What the hell? - Nikki, this better be F. T.D. - Yoo-hoo. His rusty tail is old enough to be your granddaddy. - Or Mom's big daddy. - Dorothy. "Yoo-hoo, Dorothy"? Nikki. Tsk. You didn't tell me Mama's been creepin' while Daddy's been sleepin'. I didn't tell you 'cause you a kid. Tsk. See, there you go. I'm Nate Johnson. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We'll use those flowers for his funeral. I reserved our favorite table at Starbucks. Oh. Thanks for the book, Stan. Uh, I really can't accept the flowers. Why not? L... I spent all week picking them. Well, we're study partners, Stan. That's it. - What do you mean? - I don't want you to get the wrong idea. What's up, brah? Hello, brother. Stan Turner. Nate Johnson... husband, 16 years. - Nate, don't start. - I'm just trying to take my family... down to the reunion. You know, uh, some spades, a couple of family arguments... - some softball. - Whoa. Yes. Whoa. Careful there. Just a little... Oh! What is wrong with you? Stan, wait. "Stan, wait"? I didn't get the memo. When did we start seeing other people, Dorothy? Don't test me. You know the only reason I agreed to go on this trip... is 'cause it's Destiny's birthday tomorrow. Fine. Fine. Fine. I'm Nate Johnson. Capricorn. Check my dental records, jack. So, where did you meet him... that so-called accounting class? So that's what this is all about, huh? Me becoming a C.p. A. I thought we settled that argument when I moved out. Oh, so I'm the bad guy because I wanted you... - to raise our kids? - I can be a wife... a mother and pursue my career too. - Hey, my mother did it. - Right. Yeah. That's why the last time I saw your brother, he was your sister. Mommy, I'm hungry. Hey, um, Nikki, can you get your sister some Froot Loops, please? Shut up. Destiny, sweetie. Be very careful in Daddy's new truck. Look. Everybody else, this truck has to go back exactly the way it is. If you break something, then I've gotta pay for it. Oops. Sorry, Dad. Th-That's okay, sweetie. Don't worry about it. All right. The I-10 by... 10:03. Damn. We're late. Yo, Dad. Who was that? - It's S.O.S., son. - I wish somebody can come rescue me right now. Oh, Nate, be fair. Why don't you just load half of your C.D.'s and half of his? I'll load half of his C.D.'s when he pays half of my car note. Nate. Fine. But I like my music nonviolent... with limited cussin; So, nobody who's been shot. Here. Come here. Give me this. Okay. Right here. Tupac Shakur. Shot. Nate. Nate, what... Notorious B.I.G. Shot. - Hey, Dad. What are you doin'? Mom. - C-Murder. Wait. Stop. - Dad, C-Murder wasn't shot. - Yeah, but with a name like that, he should have been. - Sam Cooke. - Wait. What are you doing? Shot. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's Sam Cooke. That's "born by the river. " You gonna make me pull this car over. - Marvin Gaye. - Hey, hey. Shot. That is one of the greatest singers... - He threw out Marvin Gaye. - He was shot... by his daddy. - Twice. - What are you... - Al Green. - Wait a minute now. He wasn't shot. - That was hot grits. - That was close enough. - Shot. - Boy, that man is a reverend. That's my pastor. What is wrong with you? How am I supposed to go to church on Sunday? Daddy, no one's been shot on this one. Daddy, why aren't you singing? Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, Dad.! Nate, what are you doin'? Little shortcut. Yeah. Oh! Hey! See this fool? What does he... Come on. That's it. I'm gon' have to show this redneck what a brother looks like with a V-8... riding 300 horses. That's right. That's right, baby. I got the zoom-zoom for your boom-boom right there. Yeah. Ooh, Daddy. Look at the cute little baby. Yeah, sucker. Yeah. Tenderwipe that! Yeah. That's drivin' right there. You know what I'm sayin'? That's all right right there. Hey, Dad. Dad, get the bags.

My God. Uh... Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Boy, that was close. Anybody else want to drive? You are now entering Arizona... the Grand Canyon State. Seventy. Increasing cloudiness... and humid with a high of 96. With the winds out of the east at 1 4 miles per hour, it's currently... Nate, the kids are tired. It's been a long day. Let's just start fresh tomorrow. Oh, I guess watching me drive wore you guys out, huh? We're not scheduled to stop until Boulder City. I don't plan on stopping till we get there. Oh, that's a shame. 'Cause there's nothing that I wouldn't do for a... nice, hot... bath. Anything? Anything. All right. Dang, Dad. Here we go. Okay. Okay, you guys wait right here. I'll get the rooms. - Welcome. And here are your keys. - Thank you. You know, I'm planning a special evening tonight. Do you have any roses, some champagne, box of fine chocolates? - No. - Oh.

Yeah. - Give me a road flare. - That's for emergency use only. This is an emergency. Does your wife... know what you're up to? Well, actually, no. She doesn't. I'm keeping this a little bit a secret from her. Oh, yes. I bet. I bet you are. - No, no. - Listen, player. I don't know what kind of twisted affair you're having... but it's not gonna happen in my hotel. Oh, no. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please. Look. I have a surprise evening planned for my lovely wife.

Daddy, can we stop and check it out? - Oh, no, sweetie. No, no, no. - Please? No can do. We could, uh, lose a whole afternoon... - in their state-of-the-art day spa theyjust built. - Day spa? But you know what? I got something better planned for us. We're gonna stop at Little Tanawanda Village. Nikki, you remember? That was your favorite place. - No, I don't. - She was two years old. And I didn't sign up for some old Indian village... or to see the world's largest ball of yarn. You said "family reunion. " That means straight to Caruthersville and straight back. "The I-10 by 10:00." Oh, yeah. That's funny. That's funny, Dorothy. You know what? This is important, okay? Now, I didn't tell you this before, but I'm one-eighth and 3/1 4ths Cherokee. All right. That's why I got the baby hair. - Sometimes I have to shave that. - Baby hair? - Where's this baby hair? - Come on. You know that get me started. Ah, man. I'm knocked out. Pardon me. Excuse me. Can you tell me where's Little Tanawanda? This is Little Tanawanda. - Dad, I'm hittin' the arcade. - Okay, son. You mean to tell me... That this is Little Tanawanda? - Yeah. - Okay. All right. My man. Why don't you just lead me to some... real, old-school Indians... that are, uh, still keepin' it real. Wait, uh, right here. I think I know someone who can show you, uh... - how to get to where the real Indians live. - Thank you. Hey, uh, Navarro, we got a big spender over here... who wants to know how to get to where the real Indians live. Daddy, can we go now? Just a second, babe. All right? I got a little something workin' right here. Daddy, can we go now? We're about to get some directions to a real Indian village. Daddy, I don't care about no little Indian village. All I wanna do... Ahh. Take our time and get those directions. How. - My name's Navarro. - Uh-huh. I hear you seek real Indian village. I think I can help you... and your daughter. We are here. Way at the top. If you follow Running Bear River south... as the sparrow flies... then take Walking Buffalo Road east... - a half moon to the crossing. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's way too much energy there, Red Bull. All right? Bring it down. And then ride bareback I'm in a truck. All right? A Lincoln Navigator. Oh. Just take I-53 northeast. I'm gon' take that service road. - Beautiful. - What you say your name was again? - Navarro. - Oh, okay. I see. Okay. Um, in the land of my ancestors... some tribes may be, uh, reluctant to embrace you. Therefore, I strongly recommend you wear something that gives you authority. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I remember wearing one of these. - Yeah. That's right. I can make it rain. How about me giving you my number? Hi-how-are-ya! Hi-how-are-ya! I'm going to lunch. My number in case you get lost. - All right. - Hey, hey, hey. Back off my daughter, man... before you end up being called Little Broken Jaw. - Daddy, what are you doing? - Come here. What is your problem, huh? You know what? I am not a little girl anymore. Those days are way over. - I can handle myself. - You can what? You gonna get handled, you keep talking... I don't know who you think... You've been gone three months, and then you're gonna try and tell me what to do. - You live up the street, remember? - Gi... You're gonna need some allowance money. That's what you'll remember. Get in the car. And you... I... I'll fight an Indian. All right? I dance with wolves, okay? And as for you, little miss pocahontas... until we get to the reunion, your little fast tail is grounded. - You can't ground me in no car. - I can't ground you? Oh, really? How about no more TV? - So? I ain't watchin' no TV. - Mm-hmm. No more computer. - And no more cell phone. - Daddy. See? Just like home. You are now entering Colorado, the Centennial State. Look, Daddy. That lady needs a ride. Kids, look. Remember, if I never taught you anything else... never pick up strangers. She could have just as well been a serial killer. We are in the middle of nowhere. Tell me you're not about to pick up a hitchhiker. Baby, what would Jesus do? Thanks for picking me up... and, um, opening the door. No one does that no more. You must be a real man. Uh... I... I'm Nate Johnson, and, uh, that's Nikki. - Hi. - That's DJ. - Hey. What's up? - And that's little Destiny. And, uh, this is Dorothy. She lives down the street. - Daddy. - Well, it's true. She does. - So, what's your name? - Chrishelle. Chrishelle Rene Boudreau. Boudreau. You hear that? - Don't we have some Boudreaus down in Shreveport? - No. You know, I thought you had that Johnson look. Well, if you're family, you should ride down to Caruthersville with us. It's our family reunion. DJ., you can't give out that information to strangers. Uh, no offense, Chrishelle. I understand. There are some crazy people out there. - Hey, Nikki. - Yes? - Take a picture of me and Chrishelle. - No, no, no. Uh, some people say if you're ever caught on film, you lose your soul. Are we there yet? I'm starvin'. No, Daddy, I'm about to pass out. Hold on, everyone. Heaven is just around the corner. Bun World. One mile. I want Chuck E. Cheese. Boy, what are you doing? Are your braids too tight? Put that down. You know we say grace. And since Chrishelle here is our guest... I'd like you to bless the food, if you don't mind. Sure. All right. Close your eyes. God is great, God is... Daddy, Sir Barks-A-Lot ran away. No, baby. No, he didn't. Come on. Sweetie. - Okay. All right. - I love you, Sir Barks-A-Lot. Have a seat back down. Honey, you got me. - Sorry, Daddy. - I'll get it. - No, you won't. - What? Uh, look, I'm gonna go to the restroom and, uh, get this off. Chrishelle, finish blessing the food. Can you cover for me? - Whoops. - Excuse me. I'm the one who called about the birthday cake. They're putting the finishing touches on it now. - Uh, where is your bathroom? - Just past the pool table. God is great, God is good. Let us thank him for our food. Friends of the night, please cover us. Black as a pit. Deeper than the depths of the abyss. I call upon the power of darkness... to help me cast this unbreakable spell. Make us all as one. Chrishelle, Dorothy... Nikki, Destiny, Nate and his son. Amen. Okay. All righty. Here we go. Oh.! Hey, buddy, you okay in there? 'Cause it smell like the circus done came to town. Damn it. No toilet paper. Oh, well. Ahhh. Ah, my cake spatula. Almost forgot that. Hey, buddy. You know how to spell "Destiny"? Never mind. I'll figure it out. Enjoy your lunch. I know they say the Navigator is supposed to seat eight people comfortably... but I don't think they meant all in the front seat. Dorothy, okay, I've got us a couple of rooms here. One for the guys, one for the girls. - Looks like we're roommates. - Adjoining rooms. Uh, Nate, sweetie... why don't we give our guest a room for herself? You know how Destiny loves to snore the paint off the walls. And, um, you can sleep with me and the kids. Oh, yeah. That's funny. Maybe, uh, we can just meet in the hot tub again. Uh, I don't mind sharin'. Snoring doesn't bother me none. See? Right there. Chrishelle doesn't mind. No, Nate. I insist you sleep with me. Okay, all right. The begging is not becoming of you. Good night. I'll see y'all tomorrow. I'll see you in a minute. - What is goin' on? - Slackin' on your pimpin', Dad. You need to ditch her. Let me see those toes. Are they nice and clean? Yeah? - Yeah, Mom. - "Yeah, Mom. " - St... Stop playin'. - Will you stop? - Go back. - Stop hogging the TV. Well, why don't you go talk on your cell phone? Oh. Oh. I forgot. You grounded. - I can't stand your ugly butt. - Capital "G." Oh! - Why you do that? - I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad. - All right. Enough. - See? I guess I found the only Chuck E. Cheese in the whole state. - Okay. Look. - I'm the oldest. I'm the oldest. Settle down. No one eats until your sister eats. It's her birthday. - Daddy. - Okay. All right. Here we go. I hope she enjoys this. Destiny, Daddy's got a surprise for you. - Hit it. Ah, you got it. Nate, stop it. Stay on your side of the bed. Nate, I'm serious now. Hey, it's not me.

D.J., pick up your sister. - I got her. You are now entering Kansas, the Sunflower State. Yo, Dad, can we pull over? No, son. We can't stop. I can already smell my mama's cookin'. But I really need to go. It'll only take a sec. D.J., we just stopped in WaKeeney. Now, I warned you about drinking all those pepsis so close together. You're just gonna have to learn a lesson. Think of something dry, like... Mama's meat loaf. - Come on, Dad. - We are not stoppin'. Oh! You know, son... the only reason I'm hard on you is... well, because one day you'll wear the pants in your own family. People will depend on you. Now, how can they do that... if your pants are hanging all off your behind? Have you thought about what you're gonna do if this rap thing doesn't work out? Well, I was thinking about law school... or medical school. But then Mom said she'll help me incorporate. So, I was thinking about... coming out with my own line of hip-hop pajamas. - Pajamas? - Yeah. You know how puffy has Sean John... and then Jigga has Rocawear? - Oh, my goodness. - Check this out. D.J.'s p. J.'s. Baggy always. Baggy. I told your mother not to stand by the microwave when she was pregnant with you. Wait a minute. What the hell? Wait a minute. Stan? Stan. Yeah, right. There you go, Stanley. Yeah. Man, where's my... Ah. Let me get a little swallow. No. No, no. No. Dad, don't drink that. Nah. Dad. - Dad. Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. - What the... Uh-oh. I wouldn't have done that if I were you. Boy, look, I've been driving since before you were born, okay? - But you hit a cop. - I didn't hit a cop. Oh, I hit a cop. - Aaah! - Dad, we off the road.! - What? - Whoa. - Nate, stop! - Whoa! Hey, Dad, what are you doing? Aaah! Oh, my... Oh! No! No, no, no, no. Come on, man. - No. Come on. I gotta take this car back. - Man. No. Come on, man. This'll cost me a fortune. This is ridiculous. Oh, now the cops. Biblio... Biblio... Biblioteca. Oh. Look. We'll be out of this thing in 60 seconds. Hey, hey, Officer. What's goin' on? CHips. L... I like that show. You kinda like a chocolate CHip. You know what I'm say... CHip ahoy. - Is everything okay? - What's up, brother? I can see... it's a little hot out here and you got... Look, man, I'm just tryin' to take my family down to the reunion. You know what I'm saying? So, can you hook a brother up, brother? Under arrest? All of us? - For what, man? - Like you don't know. You got those rapper rims wrapped around your tires... like you had your lips wrapped around this here reefer pipe. You should be ashamed of yourself... using that poor little girl like a pack mule. If we were two counties south... you would be in the chair. Oh, yeah? Yeah, and I'll sue. I'll sue. - As a matter of fact, open the gate. - Nate, come on. No. Dorothy, let me tell... Open up. Ain't nothin' but space and opportunity. That's right. Look at big, old... So, what's that gonna be? What you gonna do with that? I mean... Daddy! Mama. Oh. Hey. Hey, brother. L... I mean, Officer. Hey, I apologize. - So, can we all go now? - Tell it to the judge on Monday. Monday? Man, I gotta be in Caruthersville by tomorrow. I don't care where the hell you gotta be. You stay in here, and you shut up. I have an audit tomorrow. Destiny. Muffins. - Tell your mother for me... - You told me not to talk to drug dealers. - What is goin' on? - I said shut it! Uh, excuse me, Sheriff. If you use the 1040 long form... you can write off more than just those doughnuts. What else can I write off? - Ma's a saint, huh? - Yeah, she nice. She all right. Still gonna go to Harold's Waffles and Check Cashing... to get my taxes done. See, Officer, your biggest problem was not enough pretax write-offs. - That's all. - Oh. Well, um, thank you, pretty lady. Um, uh, what can I do for you? How about the keys? Nate. The reunion's tomorrow. We're out of cash. We... We look a mess. Let's just pull over and get ourselves together. Oh, no. No, no. Dorothy, no. Nothing is gonna stop me from getting that trophy. And with no food stops, no bathroom breaks... anybody that's tired can sleep in the car. Nate, no. Nate! Look at our kids. - Okay. - Okay. All right. I hear you. We'll pull over. Thank you. Oh. No way. Uh-uh. Nope. That's it. Hold on. We're goin'. Fine, Nate. You can drag us to this family reunion if you want to. But don't expect me to pretend like everything's perfect just to impress your mama. What? What do you mean by that? I mean, if she asks me how we're doing, I'm gon' tell her. - No, you not! No! No, Dorothy, no. - Mm-hmm! That woman has been against our marriage from the very beginning. I don't care how hard you try. - You will not give her the satisfaction of being right! - Heh. Watch me. Nate, how long has that warning light been on? Don't worry. We're not gonna run out of gas. Trust me. - Oh, shoot. - Oh, you gotta be kidding. Ahh. Come on! Come on. Come on. All right, c... Okay. All right. Look, don't panic. We can still make it to the reunion. All right, I'll just make a call. Oh, come on. I forgot to recharge the batteries. Oh, you gotta be kidding. Oh, look. Looks like there's a phone a couple miles up the road. - A couple miles? - I'll be right back. - You're not gonna... - I'll be right back. Nate! Oh, man. I should run a little bit. Okay. That's enough of that. Wait. What's up? What's up? All right, let's see. All right, let's just find a phone, call Uncle Earl. It'll be simple. Be outta this thing. Aw, shoot. Oh, man.! Come on.! The corn? I ain't goin' in no corn. Nope. Yaah! Aah! Aah! This... This, uh... Oh, come on, man! Who would put a phone up on a pole? Aww.! Here we go. Right hand, left foot. Left foot, right hand. Just like Twister. Don't look down. Don't look down. Okay. All right. All right. Hello? Operator. I need Earl Johnson. Could you get me Earl Johnson? Uncle Earl! This is Nate! Yeah, right, right. Glorietta's boy. We ran out of gas on Route 12. Can you come get us? Looks like y'all seen a ghost. It's just you, Uncle Earl. Yeah, it's just me. Who you thought it was gonna be? Bobby Brown? That the older girl back there? Girl, you as pretty as new carpet! Look at her! Where you stayin'? Well, we're on our way to the... - Y'all gon' go down to the house? - Yeah. I got room for ya. Yeah, girl, I got double-wide bunk beds. Yeah, you come up there, I'll sleep on top, you be on the bottom. Either way. You be on bottom, I be on top. I take it any way I can get it! I'll take it any way I can get it! - I said I'll take it any way I can get it! - I heard you. Get that hood off. First thing I gotta do. Boy, give me the jackhammer. - All right. - Mm-hmm. - Here you are. - Set it down there. - Whoa! - Here we go! Here we go! That's right! Here we go! There it is! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Watch our headlights! Looks like y'all ain't gon' need these fog lights. I think we just need some gas. Gas? Heh! You want gas, you try some of Glorietta's pinto beans. Don't worry. I'll work out a plan. Fourteen, 15 years, I know a little somethin' 'bout a car, okay? You just... You keep them little sweet legs on the inside and don't get hurt. Sitting there lookin' hot butter. Hot butter yellow! Girl is lookin' good.! Here, boy. Look like I'm gon' use my heavy artillery. Lemme get the tweezers. These my eyelash curlers. Yeah, that's more delicate. That's more delicate. Uh, all right. No, no, no, no, no. - Ahh. - You need this? Okay, hold on to that. Oh, God. You're killin' me, Unc. Yo, Unc, come on. Come on. Now hold this and lean that... lean that over there for me. Now hand me the duct tape. What? Oh! Yeah, these are trusty-dusties. Always use them. Yeah, one of the best things you can use is a curling iron. So, you fixed it, Earl? Uh-oh. There's two answers to that one... No and not yet. What I realize is... It's a funny thing. Y'all ain't got no gas.! - That's what I told you. - All this time, you didn't have no gas! But I'll get this thing runnin'. It'll run on lawn mower fluid. Put lawn mower fluid in there. You won't go as fast. You'll go about 16 miles an hour. So I'd always say stay in the slow lane. It's gon' take you about, oh... gon' take about 16, 17 days to get back to California. - What? - But y'all a family. Y'all'll have a good time. I know exactly what to do to have this car back up on its feet and rollin'. Baby, how you doin'? There you go. Thank you. Just what you think you doin'? Stickin' your fingers in my food. Hey, Uncle Earl.! Park around back.! I don't want nobody messin' with my truck! All right. I hear you, nephew. Hey, everybody.! Look who I found on the side of the road.! It's Nate and them.! Just let us out right here. This is good, right here. - Nathaniel! Come on. I'm gon' have to spank your butt. - Oh, it's Uncle Nate. Oh, Lord have mercy. Girl, you look good. If you don't look like hot sauce on a pork rind, I tell ya... - Come on, give Earl some of that. - Oh! Uh... Uh... You is a hot-buttered red bone... Look at you, girl.! - You look delicious, like a perfect piece of fried chicken. - Uncle Earl! Uncle Earl.! Come on, man. That's my wife. - Come on, baby. - Stop bein' a player-hater. - Can you do something with the truck? - I'm gon' take care of that. Don't you worry about it. I'll take the carburetor off there, put it back on, take the concrete off there. That'll be about $25-35. But just bring me back a six-pack of beer, that's all. Look, there's the hill where the tree was I told you I fell out of. - And there's the lake I used to fish... - Hey, second-born! Junior Mint.! Mama's little mistake down at the lake. - How y'all doin'? - Hey, Mack. - Hey, Dorothy. I don't know how you do it. - Mack, how you doin'? Hey, look, Mama up here at the table. Y'all come on. Ooh-wee! Hey, Mama! - Grandma! - And there's the birthday girl! Oh, look at you guys! My God! You're gettin' so big! Look at you! Dorothy, I can't believe we finally got you down here. I guess that means you two are still together. Well, Glorietta, the truth is that... - I can't believe you two made it this far. - What you talkin' 'bout, Mama? - The trip's less than 2,000 miles. - I'm not talkin' about miles. Talkin' 'bout years. Anyway, what were you gonna say? What I was gonna say is... Nate and I are going to renew our wedding vows on Valentine's Day... and we would sure love for you to join us. Mmm. Come on, child. Food's on the table. Family's waitin' for you. Both my boys here. This is better than Christmas.! Even better than that Christmas I got you that new car, Mama? Mack, you know this ain't no competition. We gon' let Mack and Nate pray. See which one of'em was payin' more attention in Sunday school. Well, I guess since I'm the oldest, I go first. Fine. All right, everyone, bow your heads... and close your ears. Your eyes. Everybody close your eyes. Gracious God, I come to you... as humbly as I know how... Yes, Lord. Praising you and giving you thanks... for bringing us together yet another year... helping us come together to help celebrate... my victory... and Nate's agony of defeat. Let us eat. Father, Lord, we thank you... for allowing us to come together and share with one another. Father, we know that you created the birds that fly... and gave the dogs a voice to bark. But you wouldn't have had to create the sun... if you knew Mack was gonna be sittin' over there in that bright yellow shirt... lookin'sunny-side up like a Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity.! - Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord! - Mm-mmm-mmm. We, Father God, also realize... that you are the creator of earth and heaven... moon and the stars. That's how I know... ain't no way you had nothin' to do... with creatin' that tacky, gangsta-lookin', wheel-spinnin'S.U. V... that Uncle Earl had to drag up in here. Hold on, Father! Hold up! Wait a minute! What about the time you put pepto-Bismol in the Kool-Aid... and everybody had diarrhea for the summer? - Don't let me have to mention that to Mama! - Hold on.! What about the time you burned down all the bushes 'round the house... 'cause you got tired of goin'outside, gettin'your own switch... Ohhh, Father! Need I have to remind Mack while Mama's standin' here... that he the one that had Nanette Green in the back room... and was doin' the nasty on Mama's good quilt... and that's why she couldn't get them stains off of it? In Jesus' name! Let's eat. - But, Mama... B-But, Mama, look... - Uh-uh.! Y'all just got through prayin'. Don't make me cuss up in here. - Remember there was a lamp... - Aah! I got all the stories. That's great. Let's go down here and visit with Nate's family. Drove all the way here from California. Last time they was here little Destiny was two years old. Hey, Nate. How you doin', kids? Hey, how's it goin'? Kinfolk.! I'll be over there in a minute. Cousin Nate! Favorite kinfolk! Hey, man! - How you doin', man? You doin' all right? - All right.

I said our professor was lecturing forever. - Man, are you the dude drivin' the truck? - Stan, you are crazy. We only studied together twice. And one of those times was over the phone! - I have a husband! - Yeah, she has a husband! You ruin my family reunion with this nonsense? If that's the case, then why do you two live in separate houses? Yeah. Why do you live in separate houses? Mama, Dorothy and I have been separated for about three months. Ohh! I knew it. I knew it! Look, it's all my fault why we're not together. All right? I just haven't supported her in her dreams. She's a beautiful, intelligent woman... and the copilot of my plane. Nate got a plane? Mama, where did Nate get a plane? Mack, will you hush, please. And, Mama, look, I've let you drive a wedge between me and my wife for all these years. Furthermore, she's the mother of your grandchildren. So I suggest you get used to her, because I'm not letting her go anywhere. Ah! - And neither am I. - You know what? That's about enough of you. - Uh-uh! No, no, no, no! - Dad, don't do that! Would you leave, Stan? Please! Wait! Don't do it, son. - Let me! - Ohh! Mama cracked him! Mama say c-crack! Mama was your dessert! That's what the Johnsons do! She's still got it. You know what? I ain't never heard you talk about Dorothy that way. And you know what else? It's about time. - Thank you, Mama. - That's right, Dad. All right, I gotta get my family outta here. We gotta head back home. But you just got here.! I know, but... my wife has a test to study for. - Kids, let's go change. Bye, Mama. - Bye, baby. - Dorothy. - All right, now, little brother. - Bye, Grandma. - Bye, D.J. - Y'all come back! Don't stay gone so long. - All right. Oh, man. - Yeah.! - Nate! Nate! It's Nate Johnson! All day! Trophy and my little brother? And I'm Mack Johnson! That's all week.! I wonder... I wonder if Uncle Earl know how to fix this. I'm gon' ask... Uncle Earl! Hey! Huh! Huh! Yeah! - Reenie? - Yeah, baby? Get in here, girl! D.J., is that our door? Oh, no, no, no, no. Is this our bumper? - This is the bumper from the truck. - Looks like it, but... And... these are the seats. Oh, my God. These seats come right out of the truck. Dorothy, that is the door.! Looks like the door. We don't know. You ain't got nothin' on that Robot. You know, I do the Robot. Oh, my God! Move somethin;! - That's my kid! - Look. Okay. Okay. Uncle Earl! Uncle Earl! Uncle Earl! Oh, hey there, nephew. Y'all caught me off guard. Caught me doin' my little thing... Look at Dorothy. Girl, you look good. Girl, if you don't look like a hot cup of soup, and I got the flu... - This my baby, Tangerine. - Hi! Yeah, don't she look like you? She look just like you. I tell her all the time, "You look just like Dorothy. " You know what, Dorothy? This could've all been yours. All this... Reenie, come on, now. Quit playin'. You know I'm p-I-M-p. If you don't mind, it's been a long trip and we wanna get back home... so, did you fix the truck yet? Oh, yeah, it's ready. Truck is ready. That's what I do. Yeah, come on out. Yeah. Yes, indeedy! Now, I'm gon' have to tell you... the only thing I had to do here that was really special... want you to be aware of... I had to run a coat hanger through the middle of the vehicle. It came up around the chassis, broke off on each side... and go into your wheel well. Now, the only thing I suggest is that you don't make no sharp turns. - Okay? - Great. A sharp turn, and you can hang it up. - "You can hang it up. " - Yeah. - I tell ya.! - Funny. Okay, here we go. Ohh-ho-ho.! Cool! That looks great, Uncle Earl! - That look good, don't it? - All right! - All right! - I retooled your engine. I flushed the engine out with a toothpaste flush. - Fluoride toothpaste. Best thing for it. - Earl! Hold it. There's something... You know what this car doesn't have in it? An eight-track. A pretty car like this ain't got no eight-track! I put an eight-track in. Gon' be real nice for y'all to listen to on the way home. Look at Dorothy. Look at Dorothy. Girl, if you don't look like a free case of motor oil... 30-weight. All right, I told you about coveting my wife, now. Hey, Destiny, where's Sir Barks-A-Lot? He doesn't need me anymore. He's gonna stay in Missouri. He'll be okay. I'm sure he will, sweetie. Nate, did you really mean all the things you said... about supporting my dreams? Every word. Oh, baby. Mmm! Goodness! Oh, boy. - Home, sweet home, huh? - Yes.! I cannot wait to change these clothes and take a shower. I wasn't gonna say nothin', but, whoa! - Come on, guys. Inside. - It's all up here. We gon' do it again. I tell you... - Oh, Daddy, our car! - Ohh! Oh, Earl! Come on, Earl! take this truck back now. Oh, Nate, stop worrying about the truck. You've got more important work to do. After all, it's been... three months. You serious, Dorothy? Huh! - You serious? - Ninety days! Uh, Nate gon' play! Yea-eah! Open the door! Ain't that the girl? Ain't that the only girl? She a pretty girl. - Girl, you as pretty as paneling. - Ohh.! Pretty as wood paneling. And, Dorothy, you know you ain't changed. You just as pretty as... Look at you.! Lord, have mercy.! Ooh, you just draw me in.! Dorothy, I tell you... I tell you, girl, you know, you is gorgeous.!
