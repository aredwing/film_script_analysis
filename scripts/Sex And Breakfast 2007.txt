Well, after sex I get this moment of clarity. It's like five minutes where I see the world from a peaceful place. I'm not anxious. I'm not angry. Not horny. I just know what's important. That's all that's important. Do you ever get that? Wow. Not every time. I have. I definitely know what you're talking about. You get it every time? Yeah. You don't feel that now? Maybe a little. If you have it right now, tell me what's important. Pussy. Lots of it. James. You. I love you. I love you too. You're the girl for me, Heather. I know it. You do? Yeah. Look. I just want you to know that. I'll do anything to make this work for us. Me, too. Yeah? Yeah. I guess it's good we have this on tape. Go back to bed. It's cool. I'm hungry. I'm gonna get a snack. You want some? No, thanks. I'm fine. Why'd you do that? Ellis. What? Why'd you do that? Do what? Embarrass me like that? Embarrass you? I'm getting leftovers. The invitation would have been nice, though. I thought you were tired, okay? I didn't wanna pressure you. You want this? What is it? It's, um, beef and broccoli. No. Eat me, Renee. Eat me. I'm so delicious. I'll be gross and a waste of money tomorrow. Please? Okay. I'll take it. What do you mean "pressure me"? You seemed tired. Well, ask me next time. Just go solo. It's okay. I do. Really? Yep. I'm not dead, you know. Okay. Me, either. Good. When do you do it? Constantly. Seriously. How often? A few times a week. Where? I don't know. Wherever. What about you? Sometimes. [The Oranges Band sing Ride the Nuclear Wave] Oh, shit! [thump] Oh, shit! Shit. Argh! It makes me nervous when you do that when I'm driving. It'll only take a second. Yeah, but if I stop short and that pencil goes in your eye, it'd be terrible. Like blood and eye juice everywhere. Gross. That's what I'm saying. Would you still love me? Yes. What if there was a pencil permanently sticking out of my eye? Sure. When you got close to me, it sprayed eyeball juice all over you. Could you learn to aim it and use it as a weapon on our enemies? 'Cause if you could do that, I'd be interested. Yeah. I could do that. You think I should grow a beard? No. I'm not that hairy. Am l? I don't know. You're fucking with me 'cause of that thing my mom said. Maybe she has a point. Hey, I'm not waxing my legs, okay? I'm happy with the amount of hair I have, and I don't need to do anything to thin it out. Mh-mh. It's all my fucking testosterone. That's right, baby. (Heather) See, you don't trust me. I trust you. It's just what you're saying is bull. It's not bull. It's well documented. Then let me see the paperwork. Well, I don't have it on me. Look, I'm related to Pocahontas. She had a kid with John Smith. That kid is my great, great, great, granduncle. Who told you that? Grandma Josie. That's the same Grandma Josie who stapled bacon to her dress on Thanksgiving. Hey, it was turkey bacon. It was cute. No! It's only three points if you're behind the three-point line, okay? Everything else is two points. Except foul shots. Those are one each. And you get two foul shots every time? No! Every team has five fouls that they can use up before the other team gets to start shooting. I don't get it. You're kidding, right? I'm nervous, baby. It's okay. I am, too. You are? Of course I am. Listen, we're just going there to scope it out, okay? We don't have to do anything. It's just us. We're in it together. No, not this thing. You're nervous about this thing? Not really. I was just comforting you. You do that a lot. What? Lie to comfort me. Baby, come on. What are you nervous about? I think we're getting boring. I don't think I'm boring. You're not boring. I didn't say that. What, you think I'm boring? No! You just said you weren't boring, like I am. I didn't mean it that way. I am not boring. I am fabulous. I know you are. We are boring. You and me together. I hate that we're turning into masturbators. Turning? I almost went pro when I was 13. I had endorsement deals. Mm! They came here? Not here. Another group, but it's the same thing. Thank you. Thank you. I guess our work together has been a success. Wow. Okay, okay. I don't want to scare the newbies. Here we go. I want to thank you all for coming. And if you're new, hang around after the lecture tonight and set up an appointment with me if this is something that you want to be a part of. Our pleasure centers are often misunderstood. Every day I talk with men and women who... Is this weird enough for you? Yeah. Definitely. Physically and emotionally. I mean, physically, I see people who are too timid to try anything new. People who don't understand how a penis or a clitoris actually work. Emotionally, I see people who are too afraid to share with their husband or wife, or their girlfriend or boyfriend that secret desire that hey have locked up inside them. Our entire sexual experience is limited to the people that we've slept with. And for many of us, I mean, that's not more than five or ten people in a lifetime. In the traditional take on couples therapy, the one where you and your partner sit down with a shrink, doesn't go nearly far enough to solve the physical side. I know this because I'm a shrink, and I had, uh, I had sexual problems before. Analysis just didn't go far enough to solve the whole picture. I mean, it uncovered the source. But my partner and l had to educate ourselves in order to better service each other. You need to be serviced? Oh, yeah. Chew me up, baby. Who in this room has experienced group sex therapy through my clinic? [applauses] And who, who has carried on with group sex therapy in the privacy of your own home? [applauses] Did it open you sexually? Did it give you something new to share? [all cheer] Yes! This is ridiculous. You still wanna do it? Of course, we will. I mean, I really liked what you had to say at your seminar. We both want to try experimenting with something new. Uh, we were actually planning some other stuff but this just seems like a better fit for us. Oh. What other stuff? (Renee) Well, we've been looking into various thrill seeker programs, you know, and things like, um, bungee jumping and sky diving stuff. Well, you're not the only couple that have this problem. Most relationships start with excitement. And when that begins to slow down, that's when couples suffer. Disappointment. Anger. If you ever fucking call me stupid again-- Infidelity. Hey, baby! Anxiety. Oh. No hitting. It's really something that you're both here today. Most young couples aren't interested in putting in the effort. Thank you. [clears throat] How do we plan this whole thing? Well, generally I diagnose, but, uh, you two are sure that this is what you want. Group sex? Yes. Yes. Uh-huh. Yes. Of course, your participation depends on our finding a matching couple. Okay. And how hard could that be? Well, we need to start with other first timers so it's not so much to digest right away. Some of our veteran couples can be, uh, intense. Intense. Intense. Intense is okay. Well, generally, you build up to that level for both your sakes. All right. So you'll call us. [knock at the door] Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. I'm coming. Hi. Hi. Good morning. [laughs] I want you to fuck me as hard as you can. (Heather) We're capable of having a fulfilling relationship. As far as I know, we both feel that way. I mean, I've been with guys before who don't treat me well, who don't seem to really care about me. And none of that's true with James. When we're together, I feel so comfortable and understood. He's patient and sensitive and gentle and understanding and funny. Were you able to orgasm with other partners before James? Yes. Recently? Well, this has never happened to me before. I don't know. Maybe it's me. Maybe there's something wrong with me. What other things have you tried? Lots of, um, positions. Stuff I've never done with anyone else. There's something else we tried, too. About three months ago, we opened our relationship, you know, just to see. The rule was it was just sex. That was all we could do with other people. They had to know that we were both in a relationship. Who's idea was that? Oh, it was ours together. You mean you both spontaneously came up with this at the same time? [chuckles] No. Um, I guess l suggested it and he agreed. I didn't wanna frustrate him with my problem. How did you feel about that, James? Me? I didn't think it was good idea. Personally, I think sex is private. You don't share the person you love with anyone. Why did you go along with it? I'm here now, aren't l? I guess my commitment to punishment is unwavering. Don't say that. Sorry. But you two aren't open anymore. No. It only lasted like that for a month before we changed our mind. Were you involved with another person at the time? He was. Really? Who was it? It doesn't matter. His ex-girlfriend, Annie. It was only once. It's not fair when you say it like that. It makes me sound like an ass. No, it doesn't. She went out with another guy that night, so I called Annie. It's not my strongest moment, Doc. It was a mistake to do that then. This is a mistake now. Do you really think this solves anything? Relationship problems can manifest themselves sexually. And sexual problems can hurt a relationship. We need to diagnose where this is coming from, and an experiment like this can help us do that. Her whole family does it. Just my parents. Well, that's very free thinking of them. Yeah, old hippies, Summer of Love. Every time that we have communal sex, it strengthens our love. It's so refreshing. (Heather) They're very open about sex. Clearly. I mean, talkative. They're the ones who suggested your seminar. There's this one thing her mom said. I can't get it out of my head. You know, Daddy and l really worked our way through Manhattan. Right, honey? Yeah, we sure did. Just once. I mean, just to try it. I mean, really, baby, how bad could it be? Just give it a shot. That's all. How do we know if it even works? What does that even mean? I mean, if it does work, isn't that bad for me? No. I need to find out what's happening with me. I want you to be with me for it. But if I don't want to be? Then I don't know. Just once? Just once. That's all Okay. Okay. Great. When's your next vacancy? How about next Saturday at 5:00? That's perfect. Holy shit! Hey, I don't wanna die in a bullfight. It's all supervised. Well, even so, some of this stuff looks really dangerous. Oh, come on. Okay bad pick. No. I already said I'm not doing that. Well, you don't have to worry about that other stuff because we have something better now. Yeah. You know, it could be anyone. No. Anyone but them. Why not? Well, because look at her. Her knees are like locked. He wants it, though. Oh, he definitely wants it. Stop it. Stop it. [clears throat] Well, what about them? I did so many crunches. I think like 500. My abs were on fire. I used to do a lot of crunches. I stopped doing that much. Hope so. Yeah, Why? Well, they probably have a lot of stamina. And I bet they look very good naked. Um, I look good naked. Can I tell you something private? Ooh, definitely. I've always wanted to see another couple fuck. Like right in front of me, you know. It's just a curiosity thing. Something I wanna see before I die. Do you think that's normal? Honey, there's no such thing as normal. [clears throat] Can I tell you something private? Yeah. I have always wanted to have sex with a woman. What? Just once, you know, and see what it's like. Don't you wanna watch me with a woman? Like maybe say, that woman? I thought this was more like a you and me and another couple fantasy. Yeah, it's both. Hey. Come on. I'm just curious. It's okay. I know. I thought every guy had like a dyke fetish. And anyway, don't act all innocent, 'cause you have your own dirty secret you wanna get out of your system. Yeah, but it's not like that. Like what? Gay. Yours if half gay. No, it's not. You all conservative all of a sudden? I'll let you know if I change my mind and want some dick, okay? Yeah, sure. If anything comes up, just let me know. Thanks. Sure thing. Excuse me. More coffee? Yes, please. You all right? Yeah. Thanks. (waitress) Hey, guys, ready to order? Yeah. I'll have the Greek omelet with sourdough toast, please. Hash browns? I'll have the classic club. Fries? Coffee? Yeah. Okay, you guys. So Nutsack's sleeping on the couch, right? Don't call him that. It's affectionate. All right. It's Six Pack, not Nutsack. Just call him Charlie, please. So is that like a beer related thing or is he just built like hell? I think it's both. Great. Anyone whose high school nickname is Six Pack deserves a little shit. Be nice. Hey, you know what? I'm an adult. I can handle one night with your high school boyfriend. I'm sure he's a great guy. He is. He has a bit of a temper. Cool. So do l. I'm like a fucking caged tiger. Right. Look, just don't piss him off, all right? Yeah, he's on the couch. (waitress) You guys okay? Yeah, great. Thanks. Nutsack. [laughs] So, are you auditioning or-- Oh, I keep trying but my agent is an idiot and he's just not sending me out on anything. I'm stuck in L.A. I definitely cannot go back home to my parents. Well, you're a very devoted person. Well, thank you very much. That's very kind. Hi. Excuse me. Hey. Oh, god, I'm so sorry. Yeah, of course. I'm sorry. Um-- Thank you. Um, call me sometime. I would love to talk some more. Yeah? I will. Okay. What the fuck was that? Betty's an actress. It was interesting talking to her. Really? Betty. Not a lot of unemployed actresses here in L.A. Come on. I wasn't hitting on her. I thought it would turn you on. Otherwise I wouldn't have said anything, okay? Here's your bill. Coffees are on me. Thank you so much. No, seriously, thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. You were rude to her. Yes, I was. I have worked magic on you before. Yes, I know, baby. Supercock. Those are your words. Am l? Shut up. I love your penis. Do you? Oh, yeah. [chuckles] So, Charlie. I hear you're in the Air Force. Yeah, I am. You on a flight crew? No. I'm a land vehicle mechanic, actually. Oh. Is it any fun? Yeah. Why? Just making conversation. Yeah, it's cool. So, uh, you work on cars and trucks? Yeah, well, I'm a sort of a trained killer mechanic. Did you ever have to kill someone while you're changing a tire? No. No, but l could if I had to. I do a lot of private training, so-- Yeah? What kinds? Judo, karate, boxing, Kung Fu, Jujitsu, short range knife fighting, long range knife throwing, sharp shooting, rifle sharp shooting, bow and arrow defense. Bow and arrow defense. Yes. People still use those? Of course they do. When? Why, all the time. On ranges. Yeah. But under what circumstances would you need to use a bow and arrow? Well, if you were trapped in nature and needed to kill to survive. Kill what? Anything really. Food. Bears. Indians. Mother fucker! Just let it go. He didn't see you. He saw. What an asshole. [door opens] Shit. Charlie, get back in the car! Remember what happened last time? Last time? Charlie, nothing happened. Get in the car and we'll get out of here, all right? Sixey, come on. Yeah, come on, Sixey. Excuse me. What the fuck do you want? You really should watch where you're going. Road safety is a very important part of being a responsible driver, shitface. Hey, whoa. All right, we don't want any trouble, all right? But I think we got some. Please. Let's just get back in the car. Yeah, man, no reason to fight over this, all right? You stay out of this. Sucker punch. What an asshole. Yeah, you could have taken him. Of course I could have. Would you pull over? I got to go. What? Go. You know, piss. It's pretty bad. Where? I don't know. Do you wanna see a doctor? No. No doctors. All right. Just pull over. I can go on the side of the road. This is Beverly Hills. There's cops everywhere. No cop's going to arrest me for that. I'll be fast. I promise. You sure you don't wanna find a convenience store? Maybe get ice on that eye? Dude, I'm fine. Whatever you say. You dated him? I hope you didn't sleep with him. I can't believe I'm in the same company as that guy. That's none of your business. He's pissing on Ryan Seacrest's lawn. Just be quiet. I don't want you embarrassing him. What could I possibly do to embarrass him? Look at him. I was different. I was looking for a different thing. Yeah, but that guy? At least he stands up for himself. Are you fucking joking? When you said he was in the Air Force, he was a dignified guy. Assholes like that don't travel to visit a girl they used to fuck if they don't think they're gonna get laid again. He made you come, right? You should sack the Sack again to see if it works. You think I had him come here? You think I set this up? See? No cops. What? Nothing. Are you guys fighting or something? So Nutsack, want to hit the E. R. on the way home? Or should we call it a night? What did you call me? Six-pack-- I called you Nutsack. You know why? No. Why? You act like a shithead. Fuck you. You're a shithead. All right, that's enough! You're a shithead. (Renee) Just kill it! Hey. Give me a piece of paper. A piece of paper! Go give me that one! Give me that one. Come on! Just wait. I'll get one. Man, he's a monster. Go! Hey. Who are you calling? I wanna see if Betty wants to go get some dinner. This late? I'm hungry. What's the problem? I'll only be gone for a couple of hours. You know what I'm worried about? What? What if I finish right away? I mean, you know, when we're in the, uh-- I know what you mean. What do you think about that? Well, I think you'd better try not to. I mean, you don't want the other guy getting all the attention while you're just watching handicapped. Fuck. I know. Maybe she could do a monologue for us. She's an actress, right? I'm gonna ask her to act something for us. You know, just so we have some idea how good she is. Don't embarrass me. I wouldn't dream of it. Hey! I'm so glad you guys could make it. It's nice to properly meet you, Ellis. It's very nice to meet you, too, Betty. Come on in. Thanks. Ah, cool place. Thank you. Hey, you guys like Thai vegan? There's this really good 24-hour place. Ooh, I love vegan. Isn't it refreshing? I like moo shu pork. They have that? [laughs] You know, I just, um, rolled a fatty. You guys wanna smoke? Ooh, that sounds like fun. I'll smoke. Are you sure? Oh, yeah. I'm sure. Fire that up. All right, Rasta. This is done. (Betty) Put it out. Is something wrong, Ellis? No. [clears throat] Why is everybody so quiet? No, nothing. No. No, no. no. no. No, no, no, no, what? This is my girlfriend. And we're gonna get married someday. Oh, that's great. Oh, Jesus. I'm not gonna let you come between us. She's mine. We live together. We love each other. And no lesbo unemployed actress/waitress is gonna keep me from her. You can fuck her. But you can't have her. What the hell is he talking about? Ellis, shut up. No. I love you and I'm defending my love. You see, Betty, you don't have a supercock. You may think that you are at some kind of advantage because of that but no, Renee's no dyke. She's not. She may not know that now, but tomorrow, tomorrow it'll be clear as hell to her that it's only my and only my fucking supercock for her from now on! Hey, I'm really sorry. Are you still hungry? 'Cause I could really eat now. Hey, it's Heather. I'm not here right now. Leave a message. [grunts] Fuck! You can never have too much of this stuff. Honey, I love you. I'll pay for the screen in the laundry room. What screen? Well, you see, I broke into the building to see you tonight. Yeah, yeah, I'm a resourceful guy. Thanks for noticing. (woman) What are you doing? Nothing. I know you broke in through that window in the laundry room. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. What are you doing? Are you a murderer? I'm saving my relationship. I should call the Police. No, no, don't do that. Look. I love Heather and I really screwed up tonight. I should call the Police. What are you doing? Need some Wisk? I know a guy. Are you trying to bribe me with laundry detergent? Please, this is really important. If I let you, and you turn out to be a murderer, I could get evicted. I really don't want to get evicted. I like it here. I'm really not a murderer. Do you wanna frisk me? What did you do that was so bad? Did you cheat on her? No. No. Not this time. That sounded so much worse than it actually is. I swear. Yeah. It didn't start out this way. We used to talk. Like really talk all the time about things that mattered to us. I was understanding. She was understanding. And it was-- It was fucking great. And I know we can get there again. I've just never been in a relationship like that before. It just felt so good. You know, just after a while, all this, all this shit gets built up and it just gets in the way. We can't get through it. It's like this big wall of shit. And, you know, we try to be straight up with each other or easy going. But every little thing we do just gets caught. In the shit. Yeah. We're caught in shit. Well, if you figure out how to get rid of it, let me know. Yeah, sure thing. Fine. Go. Oh, my God Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. You did a good thing for love tonight. Bullshit! You picked the wrong night, motherfucker. Don't worry. I got him. What happened? This perp was trying to break in. Help me. James? Oh, shit. What the fuck was that about tonight? Sorry. I got a little paranoid. Oh, bullshit. You did that on purpose. I was protecting my home. I wasn't trying to sleep with her! Then why were you so anxious to see her? Because she was a cool person. I wanted to be friends. Can you see how I could've been a little concerned? No, I can't. You really pissed me off tonight. Good. You pissed me off, too. I pissed you off? You wanna date girls? Break up with me first! I am not a lesbian! You promise? Yeah! Prove it. I'm sorry, man. I didn't know it was you. That's okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Yeah. Sure. How did it feel? I mean, did you think I did a good job? Beating me up. Well, restraining you. Yeah, you, uh, did a good job. It was real efficient. All right. Well, what about the tackle? I mean, like, you feel like we honestly just kinda glided or did you hit the ground? I don't remember. I think l blacked out. Solid. Good night, Charlie. Good night. I'll see you guys in the morning. How's your head? It's okay. It still hurts a little. That was interesting. Next time you could just ring the doorbell. I tried that. You, you didn't pick up. Really? Maybe because I was sleeping. You wanna know something? I was trying to surprise you. You didn't trust me with Charlie. No. No, that's not it really. I just-- I wanted to see you. I wanted to apologize for what I said. That's all. Yeah, well, good surprise. I never felt frustrated like you thought. The only thing I just-- I want to try harder. Wake up. I have to take Charlie to his bus. What time is it? It's 8:30. It's early. [laughs] What? Baby, did you mean everything you said about us to Betty last night? What? I don't remember saying anything. Yes. Of course. That was sweet. Thank you. Hey, you don't need to thank me, okay? I love you. I just don't say it enough. I don't wanna go and do this thing today. We don't need it. We can't cancel now. Why can't we? Well, we made plans. What if the other couple is really relying on this? Oh, fuck the other couple. I don't wanna share you with anyone. What? You really want it? Well, yeah. Why? What happened to try something we've never done before? Sure, but that wasn't all of it. I know. But this was something I'd wanted to do. I thought you did, too. What? I don't get it. You just changed your mind about all of it that fast? Okay. I'll go get ready. Which floor? Oh, that's our floor, too. Thank you. Did you bring the rubbers? I told you, they have them here. I like the kind we buy. I even look at theirs. I'm chapped for days. Let me see 'em. No! They're in the bottom of my purse. I wanna make sure you brought the right kind. It's always something. It's not my fault we're late. I was waiting for you. You're the one that didn't think you had to bathe for this. I don't have to be clean. I'm just going for a quick in and out. You're the one who's getting drilled. Here. I don't know why you don't trust them here. The teeth are falling out. Screwed up my bridgework. That's why I don't trust them. If you keep your hands out of your mouth, it won't happen. It's your brother, the dentist. So you're here to see Doctor Wellbridge? Yes, we are. So then you're the other couple. I guess so. Well, it's nice that you two are so attractive and clean. Thank you. I'm Heather. This is James. Hi. I'm Renee. I'm Ellis. Well, nice to meet you guys. Thanks. You, too. Uh, this is the first time. Oh, us, too. Oh, good. I mean, you know, good we're both first timers, you know. 'Cause it could be weird otherwise, right? (Dr. Wellbridge) Hello. Good that you're all here. Have you met? Okay. All the blood tests came back negative, so we're fine to proceed. Are you all ready? Y eah. [clears throat] [whispers] Do it on him. Come here. I 'm good at other things, too. Show me. We should shower before we do this. Say something. Shit. What can l get for you? Just toast. And for you, Mister Supercock? I'll have the Denver omelet and go easy on the spit. I'll see what I can do. I probably shouldn't have come back to this fucking restaurant. I like it here. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did. I mean, it was crazy for us to do something like that, right? Fucking amazing crazy. Yeah, sure. I mean, like, sexually, it was exciting, I guess, but not the way it is with you, though. I felt the difference between you and a stranger back to back right there. I know it sounds weird, but I could physically feel love when it was you. How did you feel about it? It was good. That's all you have to say about the whole thing? I don't know, like-- You know, all that stuff you said. Come on. I know you wanna know if l, you know, with Ellis. And you're not really gonna talk to me until I tell you. No. I know you did. It's not about that. You do? Yeah. How do you know that? I saw it on you. You reached a point with him you never reach with me. Baby, all that matters is that I got really close with you last night. It was incredible. I think we made a real breakthrough. I think you mean that you made a breakthrough. No. We did. You let me do this with you, and because of that we've taken a step together. I was jealous. I wanted to try someone new to you and I never got to. Jesus. What? All this time, our problem was that we weren't, like, really talking. Now that we are talking, I think I was better off the way we were before. What does that mean? It's not a good thing that you were able to finish with Ellis. It's something physical that's wrong-- That's good. It means I can. It's nothing physical that's wrong with you. It's something physical that's wrong with us together. Look, I know you think you love me, but it's pretty clear that you don't. You shouldn't be having this problem. What? That was hard to say. You got nothing? No. You're right. We shouldn't have this problem. I'm trying to fix it, though. I know you are. Well, so was l. I just don't think it's something that can be fixed. Do you? Really? It doesn't matter anymore, does it? You've already made up your mind, haven't you? Hi. Hey. Can I sit for a sec? Yeah. Sure. How are you? [chuckles] I'm okay. Listen, um, I know what happened the other night wasn't your fault. No, it's okay. Bringing Ellis was a really bad idea. We're kind of in a weird place right now. Oh. Well, um, listen, since that night, I can't stop thinking about what Ellis said. Okay. I'm really glad that you came in today. I really am because I would like to see you again. Just us. Can I take you out to dinner? Yeah, well, you know, just having breakfast. You come here a lot? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes. You should try the Denver omelet. It's good here. Yeah, I had that once. I just always end up getting the club sandwich. Safe choice. So is-- Renee? Yeah, sorry, Renee. Is she here with you? Yeah, she's at the booth. Oh, I didn't see her. We're outside. Cool. But let me tell you something. You have nothing to be embarrassed about. It is so, it is so amazing. It's so completely intimate. I mean, if you're into that kind of thing. Oh, just think about it. Oh, and let me give you my home phone number. If you do wanna call me anytime. Anything you wanna do together, it's my treat. It's on me. Okay. Okay. Good. I'd love to hear from you. [whispers] Okay. [whispers] Thanks. Hey. Hi. You'll never believe who I just saw. Hi. Hi. Uh, we ran into each other in the bathroom. Heather is here, too. Yeah, I know. I just saw her leave. What? She just left. Really? Yeah, I didn't...say anything to her. Was that rude? No. No, that's fine. She wasn't supposed to be gone when you came back from the bathroom, was she? Nee, nee, be nicer. No, it's fine. I think she had somewhere to be anyway. I should be going, too. But I'll see you guys around, all right? Yeah. Sure. Good seeing you again. Yeah, yeah, good seeing you, too. Nice guy. Yeah, sure. What, you don't think so? No, he's nice. It's just a little weird for me.
