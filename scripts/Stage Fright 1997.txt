Haven't got one, have you? Oh, that's better. - Hmm. - [barking] [sighs] [clears throat] - He'll turn up, Tiny. - Huh? He'll turn up, I know he will. He's been gone so long. Oh, chin up. Got your audience to think of now. On you go, duck. Oh, Daphne, they don't like me anymore. They hate me! Oh, Tiny, come on. What do we always say? "The show must go on." All right... yes... right. [cheering] [Daphne] They used to come just to see Tiny and his dogs... ...but times were changin'. [audience booing] The audience had only one thing on their minds. [applause] The latest film. [sobbing] - [organ music plays] - [cheering] [dog barks] - Come on. - [barking] [clears throat] [man] And cut. - Was I good, Mr. Hugh? - You were all right. Not as good as the dog, though. - Can I return him now? - No! I'll take him back. There's money to be made out of these things. I want a word with this dog man. - But Mr. Hugh? - What?! Be gentle with him. He's having a hard time at the moment, what with film... - Listen! - [gasping] If you want any more parts in my pictures... More than anything, Mr. Hugh. I... ...then you'll keep your mouth shut! All right, my love? - Oh! - [Hugh chuckling] [Daphne] But it wasn't the end. It was only the beginning. I was leaving the theater for my glamorous new film career. I had to move on. It's safe in the basket. [Daphne] Arnold Hugh went from success to success. Everyone loved his canine capers. Ah-choo! All the while, I knew it was Tiny training the dogs, but I never said a word. Year after year, Arnold Hugh took all the credit. - [barking] - Until we did the musical. ? Let's stroll down the riverbank? ? Let's take our time? ? When everything is said and done? ? And you want to have some fun? ? There's only one thing to do? - ? As the sun becomes the moon? - Have lunch! ? Stroll down the riverbank with you? [Tiny] OK, boy. Just one more time. Hat! - Oh, good boy, clever boy... - [Hugh] Stand up! - ? Roll down the riverbank? - ? Fall down the riverbank? - ? Stroll down the riverbank with you? - [howling] Oh my, looks like we almost forgot Bonzo. - [barking] - [Hugh] Looks like we almost forgot my hat. [both] Good old Bonzo. - You're only half my height, you fool. - [moaning] How do you expect the animal to reach my head, eh? That's more like it. But I don't know if he can jump that high. You bloody well make him jump that high. Uh... Or I'll bring a red-hot poker with me next time. [Hugh laughing] [grumbling] Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks? Ready, Bonzo? Hat! Ah! Cut! Cut! - Let go! - [growling] Ah! What's going on? You great bully! Right, bloody dog man. That's it, I've had enough. [Daphne] If it meant my film career was over, I didn't care. The bullying had to stop. So, you've turned on me after all these years. - You drove me to it! - Drove you to it? I've looked after ya! Looked after him, Arnold, you? You've kept him a prisoner. - Oof! - Tiny! Oh, Tiny, I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. Daphne! What are you doing here? If I'd never been so ambitious, I'd... - Oh, you treacherous minx! - No! - [growling] - [grunting] Tiny, no! - [Hugh] You whelp! - [Daphne] Tiny! Tiny, help! [Hugh growling] Hat! - Huh? - [barking] Call 'em off. Call 'em off, dog man. Get back. Get back, I say! Typical. Bite the hand that's fed you all these years. All those boxes of sausages I bought ya. I must have spent a fortune! Can't you see how I've looked after ya? - [barking] - You ungrateful, bug-eyed weevils. - Ha-ha! - Ah! - No! - Right. - No! - Now, I'll show ya! All of ya! [dogs whimpering] Tiny! Oh, Tiny! - [dogs whimpering] - [Daphne sobbing] - [organ playing] - Oh! Hello. Tiny. [both gasp] [echoing] Going down. [organ music] [rumbling] Hurry, Tiny. Quickly. C'mon, hurry! But Daphne, what if they still hate me out there? - Oh, come on, Tiny. - But... I want to end back in my basket. Oh, Tiny, you can't stay here. You have to face them now. Don't you see, Tiny, this will be the performance of your life! And I'll be with ya this time. After all... [both] The show must go on!
