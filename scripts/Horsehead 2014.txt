Dear Jessica, I hope this modest endeavour helps you find peace in your dreams. In this chapter we will approach the healing power of dreams. The idea behind the treatment, is for sleeping patients to fight and destroy the subconscious evil, that gnaws at them, in a perfectly lucid state of mind. During the exploration of dreams, we encounter many symbolic patterns. You see... the horse is one of them. Carl Jung sees it as one of archetypes of the Mother. Where as, many theorists see in it, the symbol of the ferryman... a guide to the beyond... or the messenger of death. Hey! Come here! Hello you. Do you recognize me? Probably not. He's just pretending. Hi George. It's been what, three years? And you haven't changed a bit. Can't say the same for you, Miss Jessica. - Come on boy. Give me that. - Thank you. Come on boy! Look Jim. It is her room... and I want her to spend her last moments there amongst us. I understand. I just don't think that, Jessica's gonna like it. She's my daughter, not yours. I know what she likes or dislikes. Warm and cozy as usual. Jessica, baby! Welcome home. - Darling. - Hello Mother. So, what is it I wouldn't like? The wake is taking place in your grandmother's bedroom. So you'll be beside her for her last moments with us. You should be grateful. Supper with be served in one hour. But, it's the room next to mine. Sorry, I tried. I know, it's not your fault. She's never going to change. Don't give up. I'll do what I can. I'm working on it. In the meantime, go upstairs, unpack, chill out. Okay. You're gonna need this. A lot of lightbulbs have blow up there. George will bring up your luggage. You're looking great. You too. Oh shit. s l i k s i k k i Do you know why they're forcing me to sleep next to the old hag? I barely knew her! You should show some respect, young lady. Your grandmother was a decent woman and she loved you dearly. Then why was she so distant with me if she loved me so much? It's not my place to comment on your family. Fair enough... Silence is golden, right? Let's just say... that your grandfather... was an Old Testament type of man to the grave. Even after his death he threw quite a big shadow on Rose. Excuses... It's all I've ever heard in this family. Do not be late for supper, Miss Jessica. Your mother wouldn't like that. Thanks. Thank you. So. What's it like to be back in the old home? It's nice. A bit difficult with part of the family lying dead upstairs. Well at least we see each other. I don't remember forbidding you to come and see us. Nor encouraging. Still studying fantasies with that quack of a teacher of yours, darling? Psychophysiology of dreams is not a con Mother, it is a science. And Sean is a respected professional. If you say so, darling. Well, I've started reading what's considered to be the leading authority on the subject. And I find it fascinating... how the unconscious can alter the reality... and that dreams can be used in therapy just like hypnosis is. See? Jim takes an interest in what I do. You never believed in anything I've ever done and you're my mother! When are you going to wake up and face reality? It's not in your dreams you'll find the answers you're looking for. Well if I had a mother who was honest about things like... who my biological father actually is, maybe I wouldn't have to. Ladies, please... This is the first time we've sat down at a table for three years... and all you can do is bicker. Come on. - She's the one who started it. - End of discussion. Find the key. Grandma? Taking control of a dream requires years of practice. You can't improvise yourself a lucid dreamer... without the proper tools and instructions. If you want to meet a specific person in a dream you must find a symbolic element from reality. For example, a photograph... that your mind would absorb when you enter your dream. Gotcha. Perfect. "Winston and Rose's wedding." Most importantly you must keep your dream under control. You have to create your own oneric symbol. Looking at your hands can do the trick. One of the most crucial rules. Find something to help you get back to sleep, immediately after you wake up. Any drugs can do the trick under proper control. Okay. Let's give it a go. Find the key. Find the key, find the key. Grandma? Find the key. Find the key. I acknowledge I'm dreaming. I acknowledge I'm dreaming. You have to help me find the key. Okay. Okay. The Cardinal is coming. You must run. Who's the Cardinal? Follow the wolf... And run away from the horse. Always! You knew everything, but never told me anything. It's too late to talk now. So shut up! Show me some pain if you want absolution. Morning. Morning. You look terrible, darling. Did you spent the night chasing monsters in your dreams again? Do you remember the last time I saw Grandma? Yes. You were about six, I think. It was a hot summer and the three of us had this... wonderful watermelon ice cream... at a fancy reception. Are you talking about my grandpa's funeral? Yes, I suppose I am. What was grandma's illness already? What does it matter? But, you only told me she was sick. I'd like to know what she died of. It won't bring her back Can't you just answer my question for once? She threw herself out of the window if you really want to know. She killed herself? Why? Look, Rose had been losing her mind for some time now. That's why she came back here. So's I could look after her. But apparently, I had somewhat misjudged the seriousness of her condition. I saw her in my nightmare last night. She was, drawing pictures of this horse-headed monster. And she asked me to help her find a key. Well. It sounds as if she'd lost her mind in your dreams as well. Do you know which key she was talking about? You know... You really shouldn't... pay too much attention to anything your grandmother did in these last few weeks. She wasn't herself lately. The illness had taken over. I'm not feeling too well. I think you've got a fever. Go back to bed, darling. I'll call the doctor. Are you all right, Miss Jessica? You look awfully pale. I'm fine. Can I ask you something? By all means. Can you tell me about Rose's behavior... days before she died? She acted strangely. She seemed obsessed with bizarre visions. What kinds of visions exactly? I was all very vague. Bad dreams, I think. But, would you say she'd gone mad? She wasn't always making sense, I can't deny that. She used to spend most of her time in the attic sorting things out... But no, she wasn't mad. And what about mother? How did she behave? The two of them argued a lot lately. I don't know what they were quarreling about. Thank you. The Cardinal. The doctor's here. What did I tell you about your grandmother? I forbid you to read any of her delusional nonsense! - Hello. - Come in, doctor. Ooh, dear, dear, dear, What do we got here? Very pale and interesting I'm sure. Stay with me, stay with me. She has a bad case of the flu. Okay, you can lie back. She going to have to stay in bed all weekend... and take plenty of hot baths. Follow me. Pain is psychological. If your mind truly believes it is real... your body will respone. Oh Jim, I'm preparing this for Jessica. Can you take it up to her? I'm sure she'd prefer you to take it to her A little too soon for the mother hen number. Whatever. Come in. Lunch is served. Courtesy of your mother. I see you're still her valet. And I see that gratitude is still a family trait, passed on from one generation to another. And for the record, it was me... that asked to come and bring you this up. Thank you. Back to your quarters. I know your mother can be cold. But you got to go easy on her. Losing Rose has, hit her very hard. You're... You're far t... too kind to her. You know you are right. Your mother's a filthy cunt! What did you just say? Welcome home, Darling. Jessica, Baby! I just don't think Jessica's gonna like it. Sweetheart! What are you doing? Have you no shame? I'm your mother! But mom, you're the one who started. Will you never learn? Go stand in the corner, Little Miss Goody Two Shoes. Go on! Now! Hands behind your back. Stay here! Your could wake her with your footsteps. She should take her medicine. Please, give it to her. It can wait! Stop challenging me all the time. That's it. Sleep tight, sweetheart. I beg thee to inflate my will... to purify my body and sanctify my soul. Oh my dear God, I do believe in thee. Do thou strengthen my faith. I beg thee to inflate my will... to purify my body and sanctify my soul. Why aren't your sheets stained with blood anymore? I am the Immaculate One. I promise. I am the Immaculate One, Father. Shut up! And keep praying. I will keep praying. I promise. Give me strength, oh dear lord... to expiate my offenses... to overcome my temptations and to subdue my passions. Grant me that I may prepare for death... And that I may fear thy last judgments... And that... and that... Would you like to finish saying your prayer in Saint Winston? S S Don't send me to Saint Winston's. Please! S S Don't send me to Saint Winston's, father! Grant that I may prepare for death... that I may fear thy judgements... that I may escape hell... and, in the end, obtain heaven... through the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I'm dreaming and I want to wake up. I'm dreaming and I want to wake up. I'm dreaming and I want to wake up. Keep praying. Keep praying. What did you just say? Do you know what Saint Winston is? Yes. It's a scarey chapel your grandfather invented. He used to tell me it's where they sent... naughty children to do penance for their sins. He was always threatening to send me there. When I didn't behave. When I was little. Does the "Immaculate One" mean something for you? Who told you about that? Grandma, I guess. She's always talking to her dead grandmother in her dreams! - This really is going too far. - Please Catelyn. - Try at least to... - Try what? Well if you think you're so smart... why don't you just deal with it yourself? I'll try and talk some sense into her. I promise you I'll do the best I can. And don't forget to take your pills Try get some sleep. Catelyn! Can you at least admit there's something very strange about the way your daughter and your mother have exactly the same visions? For Christ's sake, don't encourage her! She's just been nosing around... Mother's belongings and found some of her crazy drawings. That's all! I do not want my only daughter... to lose her mind like my mother. We have to protect her, whether she likes it or not. Oh, and... could you ask George to clean up mother's bedroom... and burn everything he can find? I really can't stand these so called secrets anymore. Nor can I. Catelyn wants to get rid of... all Rose's belongings... as soon as possible. First thing tomorrow. Anything else? Well, tell you the truth... There are a couple of things that... I can't work out about Rose. - I'm trying to join up the dots. - You are huh?. Do you think she quite simply went mad? Miss Jessica asked me the same question this morning. Why do people always worry about their loved ones when it is too late? You're right. That's why I want to be there Catelyn. It's not your call, Jim. When it comes to your family your best will never be good enough. Trust me, I know. As for Rose's sanity... come and see me tomorrow, when I've cleared out her room. You'll make up your own mind. - You said at daybreak. - Oh! So here I am. - Can I have a look? - I've something better for you. Everyone is someone else's lunatic, you know? Some secrets should rest in peace. Is anyone at home? You're looking the wrong way, Over here son! Little bastards! They would scribble on my buttocks if they could! I doubt whether soap and holy water would work. - Why don't you paint it? - I suppose so. Religion still manages to cover things up. Right? Then... be a good Christian... tell me what brings you here. I'm worried about Catelyn. I imagine Catelyn is very discrete... about her story. - Poor girl. - What story? Nothing to be proud of. When she was a... teenage girl... Catelyn wasn't a Virgin Mary... if you see what I mean. But her behavior was nothing but a reaction... a form of... rebellion. Rebellion against what? She had to live by her father's rules. Drastic rules. He was a powerful man comming from an even more powerful family. And Catelyn was forced... to respect... his legacy. It was harsh... and sad. And you can't tell me what happened I suppose? Unholy evils... I'm not proud of... took place in this church. You have to help me find the key. Find the key, find the key. Find the key, find the key. Find the key. I've done nothing wrong, Father. Think about the salvation of your soul. I'm not lying. I... am... the Immaculate One. What does it mean you're the Immaculate One? His faith and all his rules forced me to it. Father was mad, and I wanted to live! But my belly continued to grow... although he had already killed you. Why aren't you in bed, darling? Do you need anything? I need to talk. I'm listening. I've just seen you with giant needles in your pregnant belly. Needles that your father was playing with. I know it means something. - My poor little girl. - I really...really know. What do you want me to tell you? You're begining to scare me, with this other life of yours. All these so called secrets! You're taking your dreams too seriously, stop it! You're just feverish and delirious. That's all! Do not be too hard on her. Mind your own business please. Look, you're sick, darling. You need to go back to bed. I'm going to make you something warm and comforting No. I have to go back. We need to talk. Jessica... try not to open your eyes. Just listen to me. You were right about... I think... Catelyn hiding something. I do not know much about... lucid dreams... but if you can go where ever you want... you should try the chapel. Hello, doctor. It's Catelyn Blake here. Look I'm really sorry to bother you... but I'm getting more and more worried about Jessica's health. Catelyn, go ahead. Well, it's getting worse. I think my daughter is in a great deal of pain. I mean, physically from her recurring nightmares. It's like she gets these bruises, even... scars, and it happens again and again, dream after dream... meanwhile she stays stuck in her bed all day long. Okay, I... I know I should not ask you this... and you'll probably question my behavior as a mother but... I really need something to inhibit her nightmares. I can't bear the fact that my daughter is being so affected by her sleep. You want her to stop dreaming? Yes I do. One magic word... Benzodiazepines. It'll completely prevent her from dreaming. Catelyn... I received an email this afternoon from the lab. You do know Jessica is pregnant? Jess, darling. Jess, darling. Wake up darling. Wake up Jess. I've got something for you. It'll do you good. S S Jess? Wake up Jess! Jess! Wake up Jessica. Jess, darling. Jess. Wake up Jessica! Jess! Come on Jessica. Take this. Stop all this nonsense. Sit up! Go on take it. Take it! Jessica, stop this. It'll calm you down. You must take it. It's for your own good. I told you take it! Now drink this. That's a good girl. Now, show me. Good girl. Now, you have a good rest. Bitch! It was not enough to bring disgrace to our family name? You... felt the need to lie to us on top of that. You used... our faith in the God... to conceal your act of infamy from us. Shame on you. You're as immaculate as this dirty... bloody sheet! Llisten to me carefully, Catelyn Blake. I don't want this child or her mother... to enter my home ever again. Do you hear me? Both children should have been dead today. But we can't bury this poor baby girl without a name. Find a lovey name for her, Catelyn. I had chosen Lucy. Please, get rid of her for me. I simply can't do it. My poor little girl. You have no name yet. I had only chosen one... For one child. I will call you... Jessica. You've been the burden of my entire life. You... are the daughter... ... that I didn't want. I'll just pretend... that you were never... born. What's up? Get up Jim. You've always... blamed me for your mistakes. Don't worry... I'll get rid of me for you. Goodbye mother. - Oh God! Jessica! - What is it? - Go get the doctor! - Jessica! - Go and get the doctor! - Oh God! It's Jessica. She has fainted and... and she's been seized by terrible convulsions. Jessica, my little girl! Please doctor, Please, come now... please. Jessica. Jessica. Jessica.
