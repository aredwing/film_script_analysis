I bet you cancelled the meeting! We're ten days late, man! We've got to be cranking! We're two weeks away from Magic and you're fucking wasting your time right here! I'm not wasting my time here. What's the difference? The difference is that you're here to play, I'm here to fucking work! Go to the office! That's nice. Look here. Beautiful. Open your shoulder. Yeah, that's nice. Give him a little kiss on the cheek. You're selling the American Dream. I think it's good work. - Thank you. - Good work. Creative aside, there's another issue I've got to talk to you about. We've got 2,000 billboards, 20 markets. But we've gotta close the deal today. Amer, how you doing? Good to see you again. How you doing, man? Good to see you. Let me just kinda break it down for us. The nitty gritty of this is - I've got three or four of our other clients that are, they're willing to pay a little bit more money than our current deal is. But you're not gonna let that happen. I'm not gonna let that happen. We've already given you the word, but what we need to see is, uh, that you can write that check today. The check is owed on Monday, man. I've got the Frederick Brothers on the line. They're ready to go to contract at 2.5... Brian! I've got 220 retailers, who are waiting for this space right here. If I don't have the billboards, they're not gonna take my merchandise. I got a client ready to put down 2.5... Five minutes. Please. I'm gonna pay today, but I'm not- I'm not happy about it, man. We have no choice. May I show you this diamond? How much is this? Too much. How much is this one? This one is 110,000. Also a bit too high. Do you have anything for 40? She's turning 40 today and I don't want to be corny, but 40 would be symbolic and right. This might work for you. This is $35,000. It's emerald and diamonds. - Can I see? - Let me show it. And the diamonds around are real? Yes. You can size it to her finger? - I've brought her wedding band. - Perfect. If you can be back in a couple of hours, because tonight is her birthday and I don't wanna miss it. Yeah, no problem. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. This is crazy. Amer's gonna completely freak out. There's no way he's gonna sign this. Listen, I'm... Freak about what? They want a creative control provision. He likes to pull jokes on me all the time. - Show me this. - Amer, listen. They... they changed it. Man, what are you doing? I thought it was finished. I thought it was done. I... I tried to call you. I tried to... Man, you're fucking full of shit. You're kidding me. Please don't do that. You know, man, I'm gonna pop. It's a bad day to do shit like this on me. Bad day. Mr. Atrash. - I'm Amer Atrash. - I'm Gordon. I represent the board of directors. Man, you guys are fucking pulling a fast one on me right here. Look, we wanna be in business with you. If all goes well, we're gonna be in business by Monday. We are in business already today! Well, there's just one little thing. There's no other thing! - The board of directors... - The board of directors? ...who I represent. With all respect, sir. You know, this is a done deal. This man has introduced this situation as... Well, there was one element that wasn't in the contract. You're the creative person, but just for legal purposes we need to say in the contract... Legal purposes, sir? Like what? I'm a designer. I'm Amer Atrash. We're investment bankers. Why do you want creative control from me? What's the point? - It's just a necessary thing... - Necessary for what? How come it wasn't necessary yesterday afternoon or an hour ago when he called me to tell me come get my check? You oversee the contracts? See them two days ago! Today, an hour ago, he tells me come pick up the check. I only saw it today, sir. Mr. Aronoff, who's our chief legal counsel. Mr. Atrash, so good to meet you, sir. - I'm Amer Atrash. - Good to meet you, sir. I want you to meet my attorneys. These are his team. You're in good hands. I'm sure we'll get this done. We'll be in business. This doesn't make sense, sir. It doesn't make sense. These people will help you make sense out of it. What's my legal claim, Michael? It's not good. Man, go fishing alone. Go fishing alone! Go fishing alone, man. Come get the check and we fish tomorrow! Sir, please get out of my way. Get out of my way, please, sir. I'm sorry. I'm out of here. You're an attorney. You understand... You have any idea how unacceptable this is? You bring us up here to a closing and you change the terms. You can't put new language in at the closing! We just spent two months... Guys, please. Everybody. Everybody's attention. Please, guys. Nobody spends any money from any account until further notice. Small glitch. We've had them before. We work around them. Bear with me, please. Payroll is safe. It's gonna work out. Just give me a week. We'll make it work. Sorry, guys. Okay, no money spent from any account without me knowing about it. Please, Lisa. No money spent. Confirm it to everybody. No money spent. All accounts are closed until further notice. Even coffee. Sandy, come on in please. - Your ring. - Yeah, my ring. Is everything okay? I just had a bit of a problem. I cannot buy this. These things happen. Small glitch. If there is any expense tied up to the resizing of the ring, I want to take care of it out of petty cash. I need you at the house tonight. Bring the whole rolodex with you. Brian's gonna meet us there and we've got some work to do. Thank you. I'm really sorry. Hey, there you are. Come here. Sit next to me. What are you so late for? Happy birthday, baby. Thank you. What happened? Why are you so late? Small, small problem at the office. - Oh. - Baby... Problems are never small for you. Inexcusable, baby. Inexcusable. It's not right. It's okay, sweetheart. You're here. Baby, I feel terrible. It's all right. Look at the party. It's beautiful. I know, I know. I'm having such a good time. What's up? What's going on? It didn't happen. Didn't happen. It's bad, right? It's gonna work out, baby. It's gonna work out. You know me, right? It's your birthday, baby. What are we talking about? It's your birthday... And I'm having a wonderful time on my birthday. Yeah? You've got some things to do. I want you to go do what you need to do - and then come back. I know you so well. I know what you need. Go ahead. Go. Okay. Amer? Can I talk to you for one second? I hope it's okay. I don't know what's happening, but I organized this for her 40th birthday and she's... not so happy tonight. And I think she's missed you and you were late and... if you could just, I don't know. I'm not... Just cherish her tonight. It's her 40th birthday and I'm stuck right here. Understand? I don't know if you get it. I don't know if you get it, right? I'll be out there in a little while. I'm sorry, yeah. No, don't. I'm sorry myself. - She loves you. - And I love her, too. Have no doubt about it, okay? Don't open the curtain. You wanna open it up, baby. You wanna open it up. I don't wanna look at that. You're punishing me for last night. You're really upset at me, aren't you, baby? I'm upset because I'm worried about you. I see what this is doing to you. The look on your face when you walked into that party last night... My God, it's heartbreaking. That was yesterday, baby. Today's okay. - I know, but... - Today's okay. I took a blow yesterday at the office. You've taken a lot of blows. But who do you think I'm doing this for? Who do you think I'm doing this for, my love? Don't do this for me. Well, I'm doing it for you and Charley, too, baby. It's not just for you. It's for all of us, baby. I wanna be able, one day, to kick back and smell the roses. I wanna sit with you in a chair and say, okay, we've done okay. We're fine. We don't need to put up with any bullshit anymore. I wanna sit down one day and basically see that... One day? Look, I don't wanna put more pressure on you, and I love you. But we've gotta sit down like that once in while now. Oh, my God. Look who's here. Dadula? Robin... You want Robin? Say hi. Dadula. Dadula is here. Dada, can you get Robin? - Ow. - Owie, what? Your hand has a boo-boo? Show me. I should kiss it again? What? Could you please just get Robin? But you don't wanna play with Dada? No? Tomorrow. Will you get Robin? You know what? Why don't we go find Robin. I think she's in your room. And then we can come back later. Come on, sweetie. Oh, it's okay. It's all right. I spilled some juice. It's okay. Come on. Let's go get that cleaned up. It's a bit of juice I spilled on you. It's okay. It's just that it's her favorite - her favorite dress. It's okay, honey. Here, take your juice. Listen... Robin is her imaginary friend. And I'm Dada. I'm Dada. I know. But she misses her Dada, okay? She misses him a lot. So, she's four. I know. And she's just playing a little game with you. She's trying to punish you. I'm gonna go play with her. - I'm gonna go. - It's all right. I am an immigrant. Don't make fun of me. I have a dream. - It's been a long time. - Fifteen years. Fifteen years, man. Look at you. You're a model. That's my stuff. So, I read it. It's impressive. Thank you. I don't get it, but I like it. It's all pockets. You're making fun of me. - I'm making fun of you. - It's good to see you, man. It's good to see you. Remember the last time we saw each other? Granada? That little place with the sardines? You were surrounded by... We were surrounded... You were surrounded by young seoritas and then you were just engulfed. You were swallowed up. And I didn't see you again for three days. Well, I didn't see you again, period, actually. I waited three days for you to surface. I asked around town in my broken Spanish. Nobody knew anything about you. I hopped a train, I flew back home. Fifteen years later, you knock on my door. Are you saying that, uh, I shouldn't? No. I'm not saying that. I'm saying that and no phone call, no letter, no e-mail. Life has a funny way of turning things around, man. You became a billionaire. What do I do - calling a billionaire, man? How's your mom? She died about three years ago of pancreatic cancer. But thank you for asking. I'm sorry. I really cared for your mom a lot. She cared for you, too. In fact, I think she cared for you more than she did for me. - No. - Yeah. I'm sorry about that. No, she did. She always said, why can't you be more like... This guy. You know what she thought? She thought that the only reason I was interested in making money was so that I would be able to rip off the suit and tie and never have to wear it again. Well, you did that. That's exactly what's happened - it's true. I never have to wear a suit and tie. Anyhow... It's good. I'm... I'm having a problem. Uh-huh? They were supposed to give me money - an investment bank. Sylk and Sylk. You know them. - Are you married? - Yeah. - What's her name? - Sherry. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, you're gonna pitch me. Go ahead, pitch me. You're in a bit of a bind... They were supposed to give me 12 million dollars, you know, for the company. I've put 2 million dollars out of the manufacturing line of credit... - Kids? - Yeah, a girl. - What's her name? - Charley. Charley. Pretty name. Thank you. Okay, so 2 million line of credit, it's been yanked, and now you're up against it. What do you need? - I need 12 million. - All right. All right, 12 million. You got 12 million. Is that the last I'm gonna see of you? Is that the last I'm gonna see of you? Because, you know what? I'm not gonna have a damn thing to do with this. I'm gonna call my lawyer. My lawyer's gonna call his lawyer. His lawyer's gonna call a subsidiary lawyer. Eventually it's gonna trickle down to somebody. And it'll get dealt with. And I hope you do very well. Well, if I do well, you'll do well... No, it doesn't make a goddamn bit of difference. You could make It isn't gonna make a goddamn bit of difference to me. Do you know what? If I took every penny I had and I started throwing it around, I could live to be 1,000 years old, and I wouldn't make a dent. So, it doesn't make a goddamn bit of difference. So... I'm gonna give you Am I gonna see you again? Of course you're gonna see me. You're embarrassing me. - That your phone? - Yeah. I have to take it. - Hello. - Hey. Hi, baby. I know you're working real hard right now, but I really need you. Baby. Yeah, I really need to see you. Okay, I'll see you in a little while. - All right. - Bye. She okay? She's depressed. Her mom passed away a year ago. Why don't you bring her over? I'd love to meet her. - Charley, too. - Really? Have 'em come over. We'll get the crap off the table. We'll have some pizza and beer. I'd love to meet 'em. - I'd love to do that. - Good. Call 'em. I need to call somebody else before. People at the office are dropping out. They thought the money was coming in last week... and... they're looking for jobs right now. So, fine. Call 'em. Tell 'em. We got the money. Back to work. I think they're going to need more than me telling them. I think they're going to need to possibly meet you. And immediately after that I'll call my wife and I'll bring Charley over. Yeah, okay. All right, so I have to meet your staff? Please. It would help me. All right, all right. I don't like to go out, so... why don't you have them come over? Thank you. How many we talkin'? About eight. Ten. Twelve. Eight, ten, twelve? Brian... Beginning to sound a lot like Granada. Okay, guys. Guys, guys, guys. I know we're having a good time here... but I wanna thank Brad, who stepped in officially into the business, and who's now basically our partner, my partner. And, um, and I wanna thank all of you for doing the work you're doing, which I think is fantastic. We've gone through the difficulties, and we're okay now. Uh, the business is doing great and we should all be fine. We all have to wake up early in the morning and so does Brad. So I'm gonna ask you, please - you know, I see the plates are empty. We all ate. It's, uh, it's time to go, right? Thank you so much. Thanks, Brad. Thank you, Brad. Cheers, Brad. Cheers. It's Brad, please. Come on, guys. Let's go. Brad, do you mind if I finish my glass of wine? What are you doing down there? I'm cleaning, baby. I promised I'd clean the eyesore. I'm cleaning the eyesore. Do you know how much I love you right now? You don't know how much I love you, my love. In two weeks we're gonna be sitting in that jacuzzi. In two weeks? Three weeks. Come on, Biggie-Boy. I'm getting dizzy. You're not dizzy, baby? You have one of those? What else do you want? You want one of those? Ooooh, feel it. - That's what you want? - Yeah. You want this? Okay, we take this. - And this, too. - Okay. You want this one? Okay, we take this. Okay, all of that, please. I had such a beautiful day. It's good for you, you know? And it's good for us. I have to slow down, baby. Don't... don't answer the phone. Don't answer the phone. Don't. Hello. Amer, hello. Yes. Pleasant evening at home with your family, I hope. Yes. Good. And did you have a nice celebratory day today? Wonderful day, yes. And you? I'm wondering if that vivacious woman on your staff called today to report back to you. She had a fun party last night. Woke up on my sofa this morning. Puked in a vase... which is neither here nor there. I don't wanna get her in trouble. I'm calling because, Amer, you promised me pizza and beer. I promised you And I didn't get pizza and beer, so you're not gonna get 12 million dollars. I'm sorry. If you feel like calling down the road - for pizza and beer - feel free. What happened? - You okay? - Yeah. What are you doing out here? You know what time it is? I'm sorry. I think you should come to bed now. I think you couldn't have picked a worse timing. The board of director is frantic. They do not want me to invest anymore in any brand activity. They want me to stick to our core competency, which, as you know, is manufacturing. But I thank you for being so honest and so open about it. There is nothing I can do at this point. If you cannot put your financing together in the next I'm afraid to tell you, we have to stop production. I wanna preserve my friendship with you. I love you. My family loves you. It's not about money. I just don't wanna lose your friendship over this situation. Please... I'm like a... like a dog on a short leash. It's a little embarrassing for me. I live off the charity. I repeat the terms. Half in six months. Half in twelve month. Half in eighteen month. Half in twenty-four month... Look, you have prime real estate. You gotta pay your rent on time... I'm sorry. I'm so tired... for no reason. I mean, I'm just laying in there. It's weird that Charley's four, you know? She's in pre-school almost all day now. And Amer's working and... the house is just empty. It's so quiet. That's why I have the TV on the whole time. Sweetie, sweetie. - I'm so sorry. - No, no. I know you're lonely, but... I was watching this videotape of mom. She was just being mom and she was really funny, and I was kind of annoyed with her. You know, and I felt like I'd let... maybe I let too much time go by that I should've spent with her, you know? I mean, I know that's grief and... But, you know... I love Amer so much. So I realize that sometimes I'm more lonely when he's here than when he's not here. When he's in this house, he's not... he's not with me. And I'm so much a part of that man, he's so much a part of my soul that... when he's... absent from me... it's... it's like a betrayal and I'm mad as hell. This is it. This is life. - This is what you chose. - I know it's what I chose. Maybe he was just always like this... Well, I... Now I'm more selfish or something. You're not selfish. Don't say that. I mean, the thing is, it's not selfish to want the man that you love to be present with you. Luke was never present - truly present - with me. Was it selfish that I said I need love? How did you know that... not to go on for another, you know, three, four years? Because I was dying. Are you dying? The bank only gave me 30 days. I've been here an hour and a half, man. No, I was supposed to meet him at the park. Okay... I bring the paperwork. It's hot. Honey, that's not playing with your daughter. That's not paying attention to her. She knows that. It's affecting her and it's affecting our marriage... our home. She's not even asking where you are anymore, 'cuz Daddy's always at work. And... so maybe that's where you should be. I think you should... I think you should go stay at the office for just a little while... because I need some time. Something has to change, my love. I'm sorry. What is it, Brian? You change the fucking deal on me? We need... We need ten grand, man. $7500 - all in! That was the fucking deal. A couple of things came up. We could really use the extra 2500. I know you know what I'm talking about. That is not the fucking deal, asshole! I know you know what I'm talking about. Shut the fuck up! You're a fucking loser. Wipe out the fucking blow, man! Go back home! Don't waste my fucking time! Preferred equity. They'll get a primary return on their investment. The first 20% out will get their money back... We have an unbelievable space on Sunset at the moment... We may have to push the campaign by a couple of weeks. I think you should go. I've come here because there's something I need to tell you. I was always scared to tell you, but it's part of my life and you must know. When I first came to America, I drove back to Los Angeles one day. And a man crossed the street... out of nowhere. And I hit him. Sometimes I wonder if the man wanted to simply kill himself. All I know is that I hit him and that he got hurt very bad. Did he survive? He's alive, baby. He's in a wheelchair. Oh, my God. I parked the car and I came down running. And there was a car that stopped - and they took him away. I saw them take him away. This thing eats me up, my love. I know who he is, where he lives. And you could never... you could never tell me? For me to give you this information on myself is taking a chance that you'll stop loving me. It makes no sense, my love. He leaped out of nowhere. I've been living with this 15 years now. I have to face this man, baby. I think his anger is holding me back. I don't know if you can blame someone else for what's going on, or blame their anger. I don't believe someone can curse you with their anger. But I know you feel you have to go. Phillip Blackman lives here? Yeah. At this time of night you should know that he's at Big Jim's, down the street. # So you weather the sea change # # as the mountains are melting under you # # Watch the ocean, how she rises, # # turning everything blue # # Blue as the sky # # above these fading satellites # # Slipping away, back to the stars # # To be burned, burned by the sun # # Into the void of where we've begun # # Oh, I am burned, burned by the sun # # Into the void of where we've begun # # Love... Love is the answer # # How many times # # How many prophets have to tell you # # It's astounding # # 'cuz you live here # # Don't you live here, too?# # And blue is the sky # # above these fading satellites # # Making our way # # back to the stars # # To be burned, burned by the sun # # Into the void of where we've begun # # Oh, I am burned # # by the sun # # Into the void of where we've begun # # Where we've begun...# # Where we've begun # I don't know how this song ends. I never figured that out before I got up here. Well, now... Oh, come on. You know the drill. You're always here. You wanna buy me a beer? Sure. Bar's that way. Can I have a beer, please? And a glass of water. - You have a nice voice. - Thanks. How much? Twenty. There's a cover. You should tip her as well. Wanna come with us? - You okay? - Yes. Come with us. Come, let's go. Please. You okay, honey? Yeah. You wanna take your shoes off? I won't be long. Just help yourself to anything in the refrigerator. You were great tonight. Oh, thank you. - Amazing. - It was fun. - Yeah? - Yeah. I love it. I love those moments. I know they're not listening too much... Hold on. You got it? There you go. Ready? My beautiful falling tree. - You ready? - Yeah. Okay, hold on. Do you realize this is what I'm gonna talk about tomorrow. - What? - My lecture. I'm gonna deal with manifestation... Which one? Uh, this one is good. I'm gonna deal with manifestation and how you can create something, how you can make something happen from your thoughts... from your feelings. I got this, uh, one piece. "The words of the Lord of the World, which he spoke after coming into being. 'I am he, who came into being in the form of the infinite power of manifestation.'" It's pretty... it's pretty hard, because outside things happen. Outside influences have a direct impact on your life... But you still create those things. You don't have control over... a mother - a mother walking into a room and finding her baby's died of sudden infant death... No, because you're thinking, because you have a thought. Like you're saying, I don't want - I don't want a child to die or anything. Underneath it all, in your subconscious... It's just like, if you're in a relationship and it's a really bad relationship. You know, people even allow themselves to get beaten in relationships. So they're being beaten in this relationship, and they say to themselves, - I wanna leave. But they don't, because underneath, the core thing, the core issue - it's not gone. It's still there. And that's the same thing with your subconscious. Your subconscious is like... I think it's made me a better person in different ways. I know maybe... maybe not in every way that you need, you know? Yeah. But I do want... - I, uh... - Yeah. I should probably go. - Yeah. - All right? You gonna go? - Yeah. - Okay. I mean, this guy's been waiting for a long time. I hope he's still there. Of course, he's there. I mean, I wouldn't... He'd be crazy not to be there. Try to have a good time, okay? Yeah. I want you to be happy. I am happy. You okay? You need me to get you anything? No. I'm gonna finish the work I'm doing. I'll do your other leg when I come back. And, well... get you out of this suit. Are you okay? You're not too hot? Cold? - I'm perfect. - Okay, good. Don't worry about me. Sorry. Is your husband coming out? No, no. He doesn't like to watch. That's not his thing. You know, he's uh... he's reading. I don't suppose you have a paraplegic wife at home, do you? That would be a great coincidence if you did. Why are you so shy? What? Is-is-is your husband coming out? No. - I know I already asked. - You did. You asked me that a couple times. Why? You like to be watched? No, no, no. He seems like a nice man. He's way too nice to come out here and watch you and me have sex. That's for sure. You know, you... I mean, you don't have to - You don't have to worry. I'm an... I'm an absolute sure thing. Take very little for me to just take my clothes off... Really? Well, you-you...- You are beautiful. You are beautiful. Oh, thank you. Pretty ankles. Pretty ankles. Just noticed. Pretty ankles. And there's no way to have, uh, a small word with your husband, maybe? - No. - No? No. This is weird. You don't wanna have sex, do you? No...not at all. Okay, um, you should go. I'm serious. You should really go. Get out. I don't know how you're gonna get home. Go! Get the fuck out of here. Right now. Thanks. Hey. - Hey. - Hey, hey. - I'm, uh... - What's going on? I don't know what's up with that guy. He, uh... I don't know. He wasn't into it. He was totally weird. I think he was lonely. He seemed more interested in wanting to talk to you than me, anyway. I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna go back to the bar. Okay. I won't be long. Let's take your jacket off. It's hot, huh? Sure. You sure you're all right? Oh, yeah. I'm fine. It's just, you know, it's late. I gotta get up early tomorrow. You know I'm going tomorrow? I'll be back on Sunday. Peter's gonna be here, give you your shower, breakfast and everything. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah? I left him a list outside anyway. It's all cool. Um, but I'll see you later. I mean, you'll probably be asleep... I mean, you'll be back in a minute, right? Yeah, I'll be back in a sec. - Okay? - Okay. - Have fun, okay? - Yeah, you too. Bye, honey. You look great. Good morning. Good morning. How are you today? Fine, how are you? I imagined that you were all here. And here you are. Sitting in the same seats that I'd thought I'd seen before, as if, I were just here a few moments ago. That's our subject today. It's about manifestation. Do we create our own realities? Are realities created by us? Is the universe created from inside us? Here... I have something to read to you today. "I am he, who came into being in the form of the infinite power of manifestation. I became the creator of what came into being. And after coming into being, many were the things which came into being. Coming forth from my mouth." There's a story - it's a Judaic story - about how the universe began. In the beginning, there was just light. Solely light. And he wanted to give. He was giving off light. But there was no darkness. So, is there light without darkness? What this divine thought... Hello. Phillip? I'm gonna help you. Okay. I'm helping you. Got it? It's a balancing thing, so... yeah. All right. There we go. It was much easier to get up than yesterday. I was by myself. Thanks, really. I tell myself every day - I have to live by what I preach. And that means I wanna walk, so I will walk. And you will walk, Phillip. I will definitely walk one day. You will walk, Phillip. If you really believe, you can walk on water. You just have to have no doubts. And I guess still have a few doubts. Phillip, I was here last night. Yeah, it's good to see you again. I'm confused as to... why you're here. I'd asked your wife last night if she would allow me to have a moment with you last night - but she wouldn't. Were you feeling guilty or something? No, I just... Because you shouldn't. My wife, she's a beautiful woman, and, uh, I want her to be happy. 'Cuz I'm very happy. Phillip, I didn't come for your wife. I'm came to meet with you. Phillip, 15 years ago I was driving a car... and you crossed the street when I... when I was driving that car. And... and I hit you. I... I know. And, I'm... I'm here because I have to come and... and come clean with you... I understand. I'm... I'm the person who's put you in the wheelchair. I understand. And it is... very hard on me... to... bring that up. But it is a big burden that I've been living with for a long time. It's... It's okay. It was me. I'm an immigrant, Phillip. I was not legal when this happened. I've come to America for... a dream. And I've come from very far to work in this country and this would put me back where I started, you know? This must be very, very difficult for you. Very difficult for me. Do you want atonement? You want forgiveness? You're forgiven. You're atoned. You can leave. You can go. You can be happy. I must tell you - I'm not a rich man... What do you do? I design clothes... You're a designer? That's great. I'm really impressed with people who can create, who can take, like a piece of cloth and... Don't be impressed with me, please, Phillip. It's the other way around right here. You're being so kind with me. You're being generous with me. You're greeting me with a smile. You're... you're showing me forgiveness, and I feel undeserving of all of that. I feel that, that I...- my standards in life are higher than what I've shown you on that day. If this is a question of me forgiving you... then I do. But I think this might be a question of you forgiving yourself. Maybe, Phillip. I don't know what you want. I brought money with me, Phillip. It's not... a lot of money, but it maybe can make your life a little bit more comfortable, for a while, you know? It's coming from my heart. Is money very important to you? Money's important to everybody, Phillip, and... I think, uh... I think you should leave. Really. I need you to leave my home. - Please. - No, please. Phillip. I heard you give a class this morning about things we don't understand. I need some explanations, Phillip. Can you help me with some answers, please? How can you be so happy in this wheelchair? How can you possibly smile at me? How can you possibly smile at anyone? What keeps you going? What keeps you alive? I need some answers, Phillip. I'm lost. My wife asked me to leave. That means I can't be with my little girl. Hey. You wanna go for a ride? You drive? Okay, come on. Come on. Let's go. Are you coming or what? Tell me - why did you come to America? As a kid, I was selling figs in the mountains of Lebanon. And there's a man that came from the U.S. Embassy. His name was William O'Malley. He tried to negotiate me down for a bunch of cases. I wouldn't budge. I would say, no. He finally paid the full price, and once that was done I went ahead and I gave him an extra case of figs. And when I did that, he looked at me and he said, "You know what? You should go to America." A few years after that I went to the U.S. Embassy and I tried to get a visa. They were not giving visas. But William O'Malley had written my name down for a 90-day visa. So, I came to America... and I decided to stay. This is the coolest party. - Who's the actor? - Tyler Jensen. I have no idea. I'm sorry. - Oh, that's okay. - He's probably... He's really amazing. You'll love him. He's one of my better ones, too. I like him. He's a good person. What's wrong? Look. It's my baby's clothes. - It was on the floor? - It's on the ground. That's shitty. Well, whoever arrived with this is not going home with it. You should go and work the party. I know that this is kinda part of your job, so go do your thing and I'll be fine. Are you... Yes, I'm glad I came. And you were so right. And you're not gonna start spiralling? No, I will not spiral. 'Cuz there's no TV here so I'm not gonna catch you a few hours later watching TV. I will not be watching TV. I promise you. Please don't. - You look really beautiful. - So do you. - Thank you. - I'm proud of you. Thank you, honey. Thanks for coming out and seeing my world. Anyway... Then I'll catch up with you on the other side of the pool. And don't go down - go up. I won't. What are you afraid of? Failure. Disappointing people I love. Pain? What is that? Is there some pain? From? - Pain? - Yes. And you don't have any? Pain... No. How can you have no pain? I have a story for you. There's a man. He lives in a village. And he only has his one stallion, one horse. And this horse does all the work for him. And then one day the horse escapes. It runs away. And everyone in the village, they come to him and they say, oh, we are so sorry for you. Now you are so poor. And he says, maybe... maybe not. And then the next day the horse returns and it brings 20 mares with it. And all the people in the village come and they say, oh, praise God. You are the richest man in the village. You must be so happy. And he says... maybe, maybe not. And then the next day his son rides the stallion, and he falls from it. And he's paralyzed. And all the villagers come and said, I'm so, so sorry. You're the poorest of us all. You've lost your son. And he says, maybe... maybe not. And then the next day there's a war, and they call all the children from the village to go to war. And his son stays behind because he's paralyzed. And they say, oh, you must be so happy. You got to keep your son, because all of our sons have perished in the war. And he says... maybe... maybe not. Think... life is guiding us to something. Bringing us to a place. Trying to nudge us in the right direction. And I recognize it... It's... It's guiding me. You're here. Maybe the... one of the threads that I needed to unwind. So I'm very happy. You... are continuing to live that moment. And as a result, you can't go forward. For me... something happened... that hurt me. Not you. You stopped me and you made me have to look at the way I loved. How much I required from the person that I love. And I've had to continually live it over and over again - the thing that I most feared. And now... I understand it. And I love more deeply. Just because of that moment that you stopped me and you said, stand still. What you're about to do is wrong. Stand still. What that... pain is from doesn't really matter. Stand still and try to... understand. Oh... Okay, you caught me. I'm sneaking out of the party. By all means. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. What ya' doin' out here all by yourself? What are you doin' out here? I just... well... It's okay. I'm doin' the same thing. I don't really have anything in common with those people and it's this... big party for some... teen heartthrob. And I have no idea who he is and I don't care. And... Have you ever had a birthday party where you didn't actually know anyone there? Maybe it was at a restaurant or something and they just let everyone else sit at your table? This is... your... Yeah, you're sneaking out of my birthday. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I don't blame you. But if it's your birthday party, why don't you hang out with all your buddies? I mean, everybody seems so excited to see you... Those people are excited to see me because... I make them money. Oh. I get 'ya. All the friends that I had - before Tyler - they're not here. They don't exist anymore. Does Tyler still exist? I don't know. I don't know. And they want a character. They want an action star to walk out there. They don't want anyone who's broken... or anyone who's scared, or anyone who's lonely. You know, my mom used to always tell me that, if you're in a situation and you don't like it, you can always leave. So there must be part of you that wants to be here. This is a day that belongs to you - nobody else. You know what I mean? I'm Tyler. How you doing? Sherry. - Hi, Sherry. - Hey. Here, put this on. I can't help it. I'm a mother. Come on. I'm also a wife, and I take care. That's what I do. There. Thank you, Sherry. Happy birthday. Get out of here. I'm tired. I'm just tired. You should sleep then. The way I've been thinking for all these years... where my mind takes me. Maybe it's because of preconceived ideas... of what things should be. Like I wanna give my wife and my child something later in life. And it's possible that I'm allowing the present to slide for the sake of the future. For the sake of the past... Instead of reaching towards love. So that you can live in the light. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm tired. That's all it is. I'm sorry. Phillip. Ah... Found it. This light... This morning light is magical, really. It's magical. It's when the air starts to vibrate even stronger. It's... it's almost like the universe is taking a breath. I think today, magic is gonna happen for you. For you... and for your daughter. It's in the air. It's funny... how you think you've buried the past - and it's right there. Right in front of your eyes. You stopped me from making a terrible mistake. I was gonna do something that... I would've had to... try to take back again and again and again. But instead the thing that I was trying to stop - the reason I was gonna use this - was something I didn't understand, I couldn't handle. And I've had to live it over and over again. And you were part of that. We can go now. Let me get something. - This is it. - That's for me? Thoughts become solid. Words take form. As if they weren't before. This is a wonderful gift you've given me. And thank you so much. My pleasure. Thank you. Hey. How was your trip? Uh, okay. What is he doing here? He came to the club. The next day... Yeah, I know he's the guy from the club. I brought him back here to fuck him, then... I threw you out. This is what I've been working on all along. This is the guy who hit me that night. And now, he's come back here. And we've been dealing with some things... Wait, wait... What do you mean? What do you mean? He's the... He's the guy who hit you? He's the guy who did this? He is, but what I'm saying is there's a lot of things that I wanted us to be able to work on. And I wanted to speak to you, 'cuz I gotta clean out the last little bit of this. And I'm telling you that this guy coming here - it's like the true ripple effect... Honey, this is crazy. It's why that happened in the first place - to bring us right here. What are you talking about? What the fuck are you doing here? - It's a good thing. - Who the fuck are you?! How is it a good thing? How is this a good thing? You know what? Get out! Get the fuck out! Get out! You should go. No, you know what? Wait! - You know what? - Can I just talk to you? You don't get forgiveness! Can I just talk to you for a second? I'm disabled, too. You see him - that's me. I don't have any fucking legs! I don't have any fucking legs! What are you doin' - you come here? You don't get amends. You have to earn amends! You take care of him for the next 15 fucking years. You wanna do that? You wanna wipe his ass? You don't get amends. You feel the fucking guilt. You feel it! You don't get it. How can you tell me this is true? This isn't true, this isn't true. You come in my house! Who pays then? Who fuckng pays? Babe?! I'm sorry. I'm sorry! No! Fuck. ...Daddy's always at work. Daddy! No! What are you doing? What are you doing?! What are you doing? I can't do this. I can't do this. Save him. Go ahead, save him. He saved you! What? If this man hadn't hit me, I would've shot you. What are you talking about? Why would you shoot me? Because you were making love to that man and I couldn't handle it. And I got my gun... and I tried to kill you. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you fucking tell me? I didn't know when the right time was. Fifteen fucking years? And this is the right time? Because I... I didn't want you to think I blamed you. I didn't want you to think that I was upset or that I... I couldn't... I didn't want you to... I didn't feel. I was trying to feel. I was fucking him to try and feel. You'd gone. You weren't there. I'm sorry. But I do feel, babe. I feel deep. I feel... I feel for you. You can't see in my eyes and tell how much I love you? Baby... My love... My darling... The only woman I've ever loved... Everything comes from you. You create your universe. You're in a river of light. Scream to the universe: I am here! And you land... and you scream to the universe: I am here! And you're back in the river again. I am... that I am.
