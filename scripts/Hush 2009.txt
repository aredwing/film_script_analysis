At the services can l use your phone to take photos? Yeah, sure, but why do they make you take photos of the posters you put up? - They say it's for the clients. - They think you're a slacker, more like. Oh, bollocks. Memory's full. l'll have to delete some. - Aah. They're of our holiday. - Egypt. Land of a thousand arguments. Look at that. - What is it? l can't see it properly. - lt's a photo of the stars.

He'll be seeing if we're going. He's a sniffer waiting for his chance. What a cock. - Zakes... - What is he? About 40? The only people who wear their mobiles on their belts are dads or pricks. He's not that bad. - l am only doing this job because it... - Lets you finish your book. Yeah, l know. l know. (Laughs) You don't think l can be a writer, do you? l've never read anything you've finished. l'm not really feeling my writing at the minute. Don't you think you should put an effort into it, even if you're not feeling it? ls this about my writing or us? - Do you really not remember the sky? - Oh, for fuck's sake. - Why are you going on about that? - Because it upset me. - You're not bothered about us. - You know what? l am not doing this. Do you realise it's a year since you said we'd move in together? And you haven't even mentioned it since. (Rap plays at loud volume) (Turns music off) (Sighs) Where's the flask? Oh. Whoa.

A naked fucking woman locked up caged in the back of that truck! (Zakes) What the fucking hell...? (Beth) What are you on about? (Zakes) That truck overtook us. He pulled up there in front of us. The shutter came up, and there was a woman stood there, with no clothes on, and she was screaming. Jesus Christ. Oh, my God. Shit. Right, well, what we gonna do? Zakes? Your phone. Gimme your phone. Hello, yeah. Police. Yeah, l think l've just seen something really weird on the motorway. Er, the M 1 . Er, well, it was a woman. She was tied-up, naked, in the back of a white truck.

What can we do? l'm not really sure if l saw anything, anyway. lt was so quick. Zakes. Zakes, the police. - Zakes! - Yeah. Pull up behind him, flash him, and tell him about the truck. Zakes, flash him ! - What are you doing? - This. This garage. lt's our last stop. We'd have to go round again. We're not stopping cos you have to put posters up? This is my job, Beth. Look, l've called the police. Jesus, l even got out of the car. To help her or because you were pissed off with me? You do things, but your priorities, they're fucked up! This isn't even about the truck, is it? This is about what a fuck-up you think l am. l'll finish my book as soon as we get home. l'll rack my brains to remember a sky. We can move in together this evening, if you want. Right now. ls that all good with you? Why have you come tonight? l wanted to do something positive with our relationship. - Oh, like l never do anything. - Not if you have to go out your way. - Jesus Christ!

Someone was in the back of that truck. - What, proof? - Yeah. What good is that now, Zakes? That truck, it's miles away. Zakes, you know, sitting here right now, l've realised that the... the only thing that is holding us together is the time we've spent together because... we're not working. l know that l'm partly responsible for that, and l'm sorry, but... where you're at now, it's... it isn't good enough for me, Zakes. l'm... l'm sorry. - l'll make my own way to Manchester. - l can take you back. l don't want you to, OK? l r... l really... l don't want that.

Can you pick me up from Stanhope services on the M 1 ? l-l don't have my phone on me, but maybe l'll try you later. (Phone beeps) Let's see what the sniffer's got to say. Hello!

(Men cheer) Mate, mate, stop! Stop the car! Sorry, love. l've got to take your car! (Whistles) Woman driver smacks into another car. The driver gets out, and it's a dwarf. So he says to the woman, "l'm not happy." So she says, "Which fucking one are you, then?" (Laughs) Oh, fair enough. Well, l'm off. What you doing? He was telling the truth. He's the poster guy. He wasn't with the football guys. See this? This is a key to the big poster frames. And look. - He was with a woman. - So what? He said he couldn't find his girlfriend. That she had disappeared. That's why he was in the toilets - looking for her. Listen, l've seen this a hundred times before. Couples on long drives, they fight, they argue. l bet you any money she's waiting at home for him right now. But what if she's not? Are you gonna look through all the tapes for her? lt'll take all night. - Then that's how long it'll take me. - Why? Who cares? lt's not our problem. Our job is to protect this place, that's it. What? (Laughs) l'm off home. See you tomorrow. (Zakes breathes heavily) Got you. (Engine clunks) Oh, no. No, come on. Come on ! Come on ! Oh, no. Don't do this to me. Please.

But l couldn't have you being here all on your own. - Found anything yet? - Yes and no. Look. There she is at the car. Then she goes inside, has a coffee, the poster guy comes, she leaves, then, look, look, look. See? She made a phone call. But then she just disappears. - Let's try zone B. - l'll do it. What's the timecode? Timecode 00: 1 7:04. - No, l can't see her. - lt doesn't make no sense. She came down the corridor, and there's nowhere else for her to go. Ronnie, man. Look, you typed in the wrong timecode. Come on, man. She goes through the emergency doors with someone. Why doesn't the alarm go off? Aaargh ! Yeah, it's me. We have a problem. That girl we took, her boyfriend's made trouble. l think he may be following you. Got you, you bastard. Where is he? Oh, no. There he is. Oh, shit.
