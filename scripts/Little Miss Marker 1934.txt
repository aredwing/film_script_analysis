My horse Dream Prince is entered in the last race at Ascot this afternoon. I'll send him out to lose if you pay me a thousand dollars each. Why would we? You want me to draw ya a diagram? The horse loses, you don't have to pay the bets people have made with ya, and you clean up. Why pay a thousand dollars? Might lose anyway. He won his last two races on dope. He can win again today on dope. Why don't you dope him? You tell him, Doc. If we give Dream Prince a speedball today, he'll win the race, but it'll kill him. He'll be dead an hour or two later. You sentimental about Dream Prince, Steve? No, I'm short of cash. I haven't got enough to make a big bet, so I can't afford to kill him today. That's your tough luck. I ain't kicking in. How much is bet on him in your book room? Between 1,000 and 2,000. - And you? - Thirty-five hundred. - Sixteen hundred. - Two grand. - Eighteen hundred. - Nearly 5,000. I'm not in this racket for my health. I see a chance to clean up 10,000 by letting my horse lose. I want that 10,000, and I want it now! Or I'll send Doc Chesley back and let him shoot the speedball. But you said it'd kill him. It will, but he'll win the race. And you saps will pay off to your customers. I'll give ya three seconds to figure it out. Looks like you figured it out for us. How we gonna know he ain't gonna double-cross us? I hear tell, when you was a bootlegger, you pulled some fast ones. Now get this straight. That horse better lose today. I'm running this nightclub and racing horses. You know where to find me. Okay, I'm in. You can count me in too. I'll buy it, if you do something for us. Send out a phony report that you're making a bet on your own horse to win. Take it on the lam and spread it around. Tell 'em I'm betting 10,000 on him. Right! That'll double your play on the horse. Hey. The boss is bettin' 10,000 on Dream Prince to win. Yeah? What's holding you up, Sorrowful? That's a lot of dough. Come on. Dig. So this is what you call muscling into the race racket, eh? Putting the race racket on a business basis. Yeah. Givin' us the business. Hello, tightwad. Hi, gold digger. Hello. Hello, baby. Why the rush act? We goin' places? How'd you guess it? Where? Over to Fifth Avenue to pick up that bracelet. Dream Prince. Ten on the nose. Ten on the nose. Initials, please. F.A. Next. Five to win on Dream Prince. Sorry, Eddie. We ain't takin' any markers. Ask Sorrowful! Sorrowful's not in. Next. One dollar, Dream Prince to show. I said "to show"! Listen, Sorrowful, I wanna go for a fin on Dream Prince. You take the I.O.U. Till after the race. Eddie, I dropped into the poorhouse last visitin' day and conditions were terrible. The place was so overcrowded they were sleeping on the floor. Who was? Bookmakers that used to take markers! Now, scram! How about lending us a loan of two bucks, huh? Tack on your heels and walk. Hello, Boss. How's it comin'? All of a sudden, everybody's on Dream Prince. Somebody must be in on the know. Results of the fourth race at Blue Field's. Cold Cuts, first, ten to one. Easy Lady, second, two to one. Mother O'Mine, third, even money. I copped 50 bucks on Cold Cuts. How about paying me now? You know we pay at 4:00, Bennie. I know, but I just thought I'd ask. I want to bet $20 on Dream Prince to win. - Not with an I.O.U. - But I've already lost over $500 with you. I wouldn't take a marker from my best friend, if I had a best friend. Listen, Mr. Jones. Be reasonable. You can trust me. I haven't got the 20 on me, but I can get it. Get it. But I might not be back in time for the race. That's your tough luck. No markers. Hello. Look. This is my little girl. I'll leave her here while I go for the money. I ain't takin' no dolls for security. Look, Daddy. He is running away. Is he afraid? - Take her down off there. - Listen, Mr. Jones... - You get down off there. - You're afraid of my daddy. Or you're afraid of me. You're afraid of something. Take his marker. Marker! Yeah. Little doll like that's worth 20 bucks any way you look at it. Yeah, she ought to melt down for that much. Do you want me to take her inside? Park her on that bench. You be a good little girl, and Daddy will be right back. I'm not afraid. Listen, Sorrowful. I and Sore Toe has an idea. I doubt it. No, it's an idea, and it is as follows: We'd like to put the bite on you. All you gotta do is stand still long enough. It won't be a big bite, just a nip. It's hard to resist you, boys. But I'm just able to do it by using all my strength. Hey, you flatheads! We are gonna put the bite on Sorrowful. Mind if I stick around and watch? We have a very reliable tip, and we would like to bet two fish on... Dream Prince. I might add as follows: We are good for it. Because Bennie, The Gouge, is gonna give us 25 smackers per each for a fight tonight. Bennie, The Gouge? Who ya fightin'? We ain't fightin' nobody. We're fightin' ourselves. I and Canvas Back is fightin' a semi-finale. I thought you was a wrestler. Sometimes I box with Canvas Back. And sometimes I wrestle with Sore Toe. Mm-hmm. I like boys who can do everything. I will let you have not only two fish, but fifty fish. Take their marker on Dream Prince for $50. Go on and write that marker, because I'm gonna faint. And I'm very sensitive about it. Let me speak with Bennie, the Gouge. - Hello? - The $50 you won on Cold Cuts, I just won from your two fighters. You won't have to pay them tonight, so that makes us even. It's a gift. A horse ain't even gone to the post yet, and the result is in and the bets is copped. I know you. You are the Black Knight. Oh, go on, child. I'm black day and night. Where's your charger? Huh? The one with the white spot and pointed ears. Huh? - I'm the princess. - Yes, Madam Princess. And now for the last race at Ascot. All right, boys. Here it comes. They're off! Dream Prince is still out in front. Come on, Dream Prince. Come Easy is right on his tail. Bingo is trying hard for second place. Where are they now? Ascot. Dainty Foot is breaking the field, comin' up on the outside. At the three-quarter, Dainty Foot is comin' fast. Dream Prince is still leading. The jockey is givin' him plenty of whip. They're goin' into the stretch. They're neck and neck! They're nose to nose. It's a close finish. Here comes the winner. Dainty Foot wins. Aw, that tip cost me two bucks. Bingo, second. Come Easy, third. Big Steve lost 10,000. Baloney, I tell ya! Dream Prince lost. Here's the marker you took for that kid. Yeah. Say, Dizzy. When that guy comes back for the little doll, don't you turn her over to him until you get that 20 bucks. Yes, sir. But she's gone, Boss. Sneaked her out, eh? That serves me right. Every time I get bighearted... When was the other time? No wisecracks. Why didn't you watch her? Am I also a nursemaid around here? What'd you take the marker for anyway? I don't know. The little doll bluffed me into it, I guess. If you ever get through sweepin', lock up the joint and go home. Yes, sir. My goodness. She stay upstairs in my restaurant all afternoon. Eat two time chop suey... free! What are you doing, Black Knight? I done thought your pappy come got you. Maybe he forgot me. Does he go around forgettin' you? He forgot me once at the circus, and they arrested the man that found me. dI do d dBecause a kiss can make me d dAs weak as a lamb d dBut I'm a black sheep who's blue d d They call it paradise d d And yet it leaves me with a sigh d d I've got what money buys d d But I want things no money can buy d d I'm ridin' high for a fall d d Where will I go when I'm through d d Why doesn't someone take me away from it all d d I'm just a black sheep who's blue d dd Beat it.

Where are you going, Black Knight? Home, Princess. I'm leaving you with him. - Yours? - You know I ain't married. This is the little kid Sorrowful picked up for the $20 marker. - Who are you anyway? - My name is MarthyJane. Hey. That's very "co-accidental. " Marthy sounds like marker, and that's just what she is. Little Miss Marker. Where's your old man? Your daddy. I don't know. - Where do you live? - In a house made of bricks. There must be at least two of those. Which one is it? It's not as nice as a castle. - What castle? - Sir Lancelot knows about the castle. Sir Lancelot? He is Sir Lancelot. Everybody knows you're a fast worker, but why hand a line to a young dame like that? I didn't hand her any line. Kids are always pickin' up things like that. Say, she's a chunky little filly. Chunky? I'll bet she don't weigh 45 pounds. - For how much? - You name it. How about it? Let's get organized. We'll each put 100 in a pool. The man who gets closest takes the money. Okay with me. I'll still say 45 pounds. You are the Strong Knight. Hey. What have you been doing? Showing her your muscles? Quit wisecracking. Forty pounds. I'm not used to hefting young dames. Forty-six pounds. You are the Honest Knight. What have you been doing? Showing her your parole? Nix. Give the kid to me. All right. Here. You guys ought to be ashamed of yourself, tossing a kid like that around like a ball. I like it. I can tell best by walking a little with her. Uh-huh. Tell me what you weigh, kid, and I'll buy ya a doll. I don't know. - Come on, Bennie. Stop chiselin'. - Me? Chiseling? I was just tellin' her a story. Forty-three pounds. You are Sir Percy. She's making storybook fairies out of us. That would be something to look at. - You take her, Regret. - Not me, not me. I'm not dizzy enough for this. I hear you've been dizzy plenty trying to guess things about a certain redhead. I wasn't interested in her weight. Why don't you lift me? I don't wanna lift ya. Lift me! No! Aw, go on. Go ahead, Sorrowful. Are you Sir Sorry, the Sad Knight? Forty-and-a-half pounds. You hold the stakes. Come on. We'll weigh her in the kitchen. Sir Percivale, Sir Sorry, Sir Lancelot. We're all dizzy. You are Lady Guinevere. King Arthur's Lady Guinevere? You know about it too? Yes. Did you ever break a lance for a lady fair? Not recently. Who is Sir Galahad, Marky? He's the best of all. I haven't seen him around here. But I know who you are. Yes? You are the Kind Keeper. The Kind Keeper of what, Marky? Of the charger, the horse the princess rides. Who told you about all this? My mommy used to read to me about King Arthur. Where is your mother? My mommy got awfully tired and went away. She's never coming back anymore. Bring her over here. Who had top weight? My guess was 46 pounds. You lose. Who's next? I said 45. You lose! Next? Forty-three. Take a deep breath. Cut it out, Bennie. When I lifted her, she was breathin' natural. You lose. I win by three ounces. Wait a minute. Hey, nix. She had it on when I tested her. My guess is 40-and-a-half pounds. Outguessed ya, Steve. Come on, babe. Let's get outta here. So long, kid. Good-bye, Lady Guinevere. We are in a jam. She's on our hands for tonight. "Our hands"? Since when have you started sharing with other citizens? Listen, I've always been generous in a quiet way. Very quiet. Practically silent. What am I gonna do with a kid? Keep her till tomorrow. Her old man will show up. Is that what she weighs, 40 pounds? Forty-and-a-half pounds of trouble. Psst! I wouldn't say anything about that if I were you. Oh, you ready for bed? But I can't sleep in my underwear. All right. Take them off. They button up the back. See? There you are. Well, what is it? I didn't go to the bathroom. Okay, scram. Scram. If I had any sense, I'd have taken her to the police station. Sir Sorry, I haven't any toothbrush. Skip it. Are you playing a game? Yeah. - What are you playing? - Sucker. Hello, kid. Listen, baby. Climb out of the hay and meet me over at Sorrowful's office with the ice. 'Cause I need dough! So you lost all that money in a card game, huh? You want my new bracelet too? Okay, Indian giver. Sarah? Yes'm? Get my jewel case. They ain't goin' away again, is they, Miss Bangles? Yep. But they only just come back from the pawnshop. I know. I'm thinking of having a bracelet made out of the pawn tickets. We was just thinkin' of havin' breakfast. But like you know, we have no scratch whatever. Watch this doll till her old man gets back, and I'll give you two bits for breakfast. But we're hungry now. You'll be hungrier later. There is something to that. I agree with ya. When you come to think of it, there is. Mind her! Do we have to do everything this little girl says? I want that big stick of peppermint. But we... Sorrowful said to mind her. Hello! So you still got the kid, huh? Yeah. When that guy shows for his kid, collect the dough he owes me. Twenty bucks. Twenty-one bucks. Her dinner cost me 85 cents, and I spent 15 cents for her breakfast. What? No carfare? Hi, Steve. Hi. I need 10,000. It's okay with you? It's not only okay, it's a habit. So this is what they call goin' for a dame in a big way? Try it sometime. Pick me up a doll that can make me do it. Maybe I'll pick up a guy who will give and let me keep. Listen, baby. I'm only borrowin' the ice. I want that 10,000 to bet on Dream Prince when he runs at Viaduct. That plug? He lost yesterday. When he runs at Viaduct, we'll slip him the speedball. He'll walk away with it at ten to one. Ten thousand at ten to one. That's $100,000. I am sorry to disturb you, citizens. But wrap your ears around this. "Big Steve's Stables suspended for 30 days. " Ouch! "Yesterday's race by Dream Prince to be investigated. "Betting coup rumor reaches officials. Books carried heavy play on horse. Jockey denies pulling. " Well, you won't need the money now. I've been suspended, but the horse ain't. He can't run as long as you own him. I'll get him a phony owner. I'll turn him over to somebody I can trust. Who do we know who ain't in the race racket and is a square shooter? How about Bennie, The Gouge? He's not in the race racket. And if he was, it would be too bad for us. Why can't I own him? Because it's known to all that you're Big Steve's girl. Who then? Everybody speaks highly of the Statue of Liberty. Hey. "Bets $20 on losing horse, then takes life. An unidentified man was found dead... "in his gas-filled attic room this morning in Prindle Alley. "In his pocket was found a scribbled ticket... some bookmaker had given him for a $20 bet on Dream Prince. " It's the kid's father. Bumped himself off. Tells about the kid and everything. Janitor thinks he left the kid with friends. I'm having fun! Go out and have some more fun, kid. You can use it. Well, she goes to the cops now for sure. This ain't findin' a new owner for the horse. Give me Police Headquarters. You got no more chance of finding a square shooter... than that kid has of ever seeing her old man. Never mind. I'll lend you the money, Steve, providing you bet half for me. Why should I? Because I've got the new owner, one you can trust. Show me the new owner first. There. You mean Marky? What do you mean, you're takin' my stick to my barbershop... Oh, my peppermint stick! Ooh! Hey, what is this? You told us to mind her and she wanted it. Step back, Steve. This horse is afraid of you. The charger! Look out, honey. Oh, he won't hurt her. He's gentle as a kitten except... I want him. I want this charger. He's yours, darling. Mine? Marky's? All yours. May I ride on him? - Get him in the van. Take him away! - Stay back! They're taking my charger away. I told you to keep away from him. You know he's afraid of you. Why should he be afraid of me? Horses are afraid of some people, and they don't explain why. - Get him over to Viaduct! - Okay. Come here, Doc. I want the odds to stay at ten to one, ya understand? Anybody ask ya about his condition just say he's still slowed down. They won't believe that if you go bettin' on him. That's all right. I'm leaving for Chicago tomorrow. I want to place all my bets out there on the quiet. I'll get the money down at ten to one before the New York mob gets wise to my play out there. Okay. I'll be back the day after the race. dd Gee, that's a swell tune. Gonna miss me, honey? I miss things easy. From now on, baby, you can nail down the ice. Our end of this is gonna be 50,000. "Our end"? Mm-hmm. Wonder why Sorrowful don't show up with that dough. I was just waitin' for you two to come up for air. Remember you're bettin' half of this for... I know. Half for you. Time to beat it, Boss. No playin' around. You notice how he trusts me? Hmm. Keep your eye on her, Sorrowful. Sure. Well, tightwad, you're my watchman. You'll need watchin', gold digger. If you wanna be kept busy, I can arrange it. I'm busy now playin' nursemaid to one doll. I hear you like it so well you got a new apartment for the kid. - I couldn't stable her in that little... - Hello, Sorrowful. Hello, Copper. Regret told me I'd find you over here. One of your tickets, ain't it? Yeah. We found it in the pocket of a guy who killed himself. He had a kid. You see or hear anything about her? No. Uh-huh. Thanks. dd Takin' a long chance, ain't ya? Got to keep her now till after the race. But it looks like playin' nursemaid is liable to have its moments. I think as follows: This is a swell joint Sorrowful's got here. I agree with ya. He must have spent most of our 50 bucks on this setup. Cold! How could it be cold when there's no ice? That's right. It must be us that's cold. Hey, are you tryin' to get gay? Listen, now... You want to wake up that kid again? He smacked me on the brain. Sir Sorry! She's back again. You go to bed. I don't wanna go to bed. What do you do about putting a baby to sleep? Tell her the dirt about Bunny Rabbit and the big bad Foxy-Woxy. How they comin', kid? Where did she pick that up? Listenin' to you mugs. Now, you go to bed. Nix to that. The kid is getting tough. You'd better tell her a fairy story. Oh, come on. Let's play cards. It's up to you to bet. You got a couple of ladies showing. A couple of queens ain't much, but I'll bet two bucks. Oh, look! A picture of Lady Guinevere. Oh! Three Lady Guineveres. And me with only two King Arthurs. What do you mean by picking up that card? I put you to bed three times. You get in there and stay in there! Lay off. She don't know no better. She spoiled the killing for me. Look, it's all right. He didn't mean nothin'. He doesn't like me! He don't even like himself. I want my daddy! I propose as follows: You go to sleep. Look, kid, at the watch. I don't wanna. Hey, where did you get that watch? Don't be technical at a time like this. Look, Canvas Back and I, we'll make fun for ya, huh? Well, personally, I think the watch is a better gag. Hey, me eye! Now I got ya. How do you like this hold? L- I liked that. It's a setup. Come on, you guys. Go on home. What about the poker game? We'll set it up tomorrow night. Good night. So long. What did you want to stick your finger in my eye for? Honest I didn't mean it. I was only playing. Now, what's the matter now? You don't like me! Do you always cry when somebody don't like ya? Yes! You got a lot of crying to do. Go to sleep. My mother used to read to me about King Arthur every night before I went to sleep. Be reasonable! I won't! All right, all right. All right. What's that, uh... What's that guy's name? King Arthur. King Arthur, all right. "When they bang away from the tape tomorrow at Pimlico, "you can wager the family knives and forks that... "that King Arthur will be showing his heels to the best of them. Tomorrow morning when... King Arthur steps out... " Hmm? "It is conceded by the wise rail birds... "that he will hang up a new record. "Although the track is liable to be muddy, "uh, King Arthur will go splashing through the wind. In the Preakness last year, King Arthur showed what he had by running the mile in one... " Give that guy the rouse. I'll tell you about it later. Go on. Scram. Who are you? I'm the guy that just told you to scram. You leave me alone! Take your hands off! Who's he? A pest. If he'd have followed me home, I'd have never gotten rid of him. So you bring him here? You're my watchman. Big Steve was hardly out of town when you step out with a good-time Charley! Stop yelling at me. Well, he's gone. Beat it. Sir Sorry! Are you satisfied? I spent all night puttin' her to sleep and you come here and start yelling! Sir Sorry! Wait. I'll put her to sleep. And when you do, blow. I'm goin' to bed. Oh. Hello. Why aren't you asleep? Aw, lay off me. Oh, that's no way to talk, honey. Will you sing to me? Will you go to sleep then? Sure. d Go to sleep, you gorgeous little rascal d d Thank your lucky stars you got a bed d d You better get your shut-eye while the gettin' is good d d You've got some tough nights ahead d d You'll grow up and find it's all a racket d d Cards are stacked against ya from the start d d Us gals have got to take it from the time that we're born d d Because we're born with a heart d d You're only a doll d d And a man will have you crying too soon d d For after all d d You can't even trust the man in the moon d d Go to sleep and dream about your charger d dd d Sir Galahad is waitin'... dd Well, what are you doing up? Lookin' for some eats. Ain't you ever anything but hungry? You wait till nurse gets here. She'll get your breakfast. We are hungry. Well, I ain't hungry. Well, we are. What do you mean "we"? She would be hungry when she wakes up. Hey, what's the idea? "Idea"? Where's the kid? The kid's up. "Up"? I sang myself to sleep. Yeah, your singin' is like that. I'm not runnin' a flophouse for dames to sleep out. I don't happen to be a dame that sleeps out. I fell asleep accidental. Usin' my place as a hideout from a good-time Charley. Aw, shut up. All right. Take it on the lam. As soon as I get some clothes. You're wearin' clothes. I'm not going out this time of day with these clothes on. If you went home nights, instead of hanging around with a... Maybe I could get home nights, if you didn't shout and wake up kids. I wouldn't have to shout if you stayed away. It won't happen again. I'll give you plenty of air. I'll take gallons of it. Better than that, I'll give you oceans of it. I'll take three oceans worth. You would. It's free. The nurse isn't here yet, and I wanna get dressed. All right, honey. Go and get your clothes. I'll dress you. Circle seven, one, six, three, three. Why, honey, it's all torn. That's all I got. Hello, Sarah? Bring your clothes? Where did you all say? Who? Mr. SorrowfulJones? Yes'm, Miss Bangles. I'll hurry. Mr. SorrowfulJones. A delivery boy says they're for you. I didn't order this stuff, whatever it is. Come here! What's these? Miss Carson ordered them. Bangles? What did you bring them here for? She said to deliver them to her apartment after I collected here. Collected? Yes, sir, $52.60. You tell him that. $52.60. $52.60. Yeah, that's right. We're not questionin' the amount. Pay this guy. Huh? You said pay him? Now, once more, Marky, and do it the way I told you. All right, but I want to sit on the piano like you do. All right. dd d Look at the funny side and have your fun d d Stay by your honey's side and laugh, you son of a gun d d It doesn't cost a thing d d To buy the sun d d You haven't lost a thing So laugh, you son of a gun d d I don't mean to snicker d Hah, hah, hah! d I don't mean to giggle d Hee, hee, hee! d I don't mean to chuckle d d No, no, no, no What I mean is d d Ho, ho, ho, ho Look at the funny side d d For when you're done d d It's all a buggy ride d d So laugh you son of a gun d d Look at the funny side d d Then have your fun d d Stay by your honey's side d d And laugh you son of a gun d d It doesn't cost a thing d d To buy the sun d d You haven't lost a thing d d So laugh you son of a gun d d I don't mean to snicker d Hah, hah, hah! dI don't mean to giggle d Hee, hee, hee! dI don't mean to chuckle d d No, no, no, no d d What I mean is ho, ho, ho, ho d d Look at the funny side d d For when you're done d d It's all a buggy ride d d So laugh you son of a gun dd Hi, gold digger. Hello! Oh, Sir Sorry, look at my new dress. She looks human now. Oh, I've got so many pretty clothes. $52.60 to buy clothes for a little doll like her! Why didn't you send them back? 'Cause I wasn't there when they was delivered. Regret paid for 'em. When I got home and found the things here, I thought I'd guessed right for a change. "Guessed right"? Oh, let it go. You wouldn't understand anyway. Looks like you could be happy in a swell joint like this. Sure. Steve phoned four times last night between 1:00 and 5:00 this morning. If Steve finds out you stayed at my place... Oh, I phoned him a while ago. I told him I had the kid here and shut off the phone. Oh, you handed him a line. Yeah. I was afraid he'd put the slug on ya. He might get in a jam. For puttin' the slug on me? There's probably a law against it. Come on, you dogs! Show 'em your heels! Come on, you dogs! Give 'em the whip! Hooray! The winner! Here. When you get the kid to your place, you might try reading to her out of this instead of that racing form. Oh, I paid for it myself. It's a little worn, ain't it? I hadn't noticed it. Maybe I should have ordered you some clothes. You dames worry a lot about clothes, don't ya? It ain't only clothes. When a girl starts going for a guy, clothes don't mean a thing. Yeah, I hear they get married even in them nudist colonies. Good-bye, Lady Guinevere. Good-bye, Marky. $52.60. "Sir Lancelot came home two days... "before the Feast of Pentecost. "King Arthur and all the court were full glad of his coming. "When Sir Gawain, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sag... Sir... " Sir Sagramore. "Sir Sagramore... "saw Sir Lancelot in Sir Kay's armor, "then they wished well it was he that... smote them down all with one spear. " I want the other one. What other one? This is King Arthur, ain't it? I want the King Arthur you was reading me about. What King Arthur? That was always kicking dust in the face of a lot of bang tails. Talkin' like that ain't nice. What's nice? Bein' a good girl is nice. I'm a bad girl. Nurse says so. Why? Nurse says there's somebody named God. A girl's bad if she doesn't pray to him every night. Yeah? Daddy says there's nobody named God. When did he say that? When my mom went away. I guess your daddy got a bad break. But what he said wasn't right... not just right. He kind of forgot a little. I mean, there is somebody named God. Do you know Him? I heard about Him. From what I hear, He's a pretty good sport. Always trying to give a citizen a break. There's something you want and can't promote it for yourself, ask God for it. As often as not, He comes through. You write letters to Him like you do to Santa Claus? Oh, no. That's where praying comes in. But bad girls like me can't pray. You ain't a bad girl. Then show me how to pray. You lay down and go to sleep. But I want to ask for something. You would. Regret knows everything. I'll ask him to show me how to pray. Now don't you go asking that mug Regret about anything. All right. Get out of bed. I'll show ya how to pray... sort of. But don't you tell anybody. See? Is it a secret? Between you and me. Now, kneel down. Put your hands together like this. Elbows on the bed. Shut your eyes. You gonna shut yours too? Nope. I got to see that you do it right. Now what do I do? Say like this: "Now I lay me down to sleep... Now I lay me down to sleep... "and pray the Lord my soul to keep. And pray the Lord my soul to keep. "If I should die before I wake, If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. " I pray the Lord my soul to take. And make me a good little girl. You wanna be a little girl? No, no, dear. Make you a good little girl. Make me a good little girl. Is that all? That's the works. But when do I ask for what I want? You better do it right now while your prayer's still hot. Please, God, buy Sir Sorry a new suit of clothes. You're crazy. You don't believe it? I didn't believe it myself. I had to get soused before I... Regret's on a bender. She goes out and buys $52.60 worth of clothes... and charges-s-s them to him and he paid. You paid. He wasn't there when they were delivered. Listen, tootsy, I am crocked now. But I was sober yesterday when the boy... came in to collect $52.60 and Sorrowful paid. Then he was there. He did pay. Sure. He opened the box, and he looked at the... stuff. And he turned to me and he says, "Regret," he says, "pay this guy. " And that is the reason I am on this bender. So, I am up at Sorrowful's house this afternoon... Regret's been seeing things. Tsk, tsk, tsk. I am up at Sorrowful's house this afternoon. And I am talking with the little girl. And all of a sudden... Something comes through the door, and I look twice and it's... It's Sorrowful! One, sir? Scram! Good evening, sir. Your chair, sir. Beat it. Yes, sir. Can I touch? Can't a citizen buy a new suit of clothes without everybody goin' batty? What I mean, Sorrowful, you look swell. Looks all right, huh? It's the best break a suit of clothes has had in years. It ain't because of anything I said, is it? No. Ain't because of anything anybody said. I needed a new suit of clothes and I got it. Now lay off. Pardon my enthusiasm. I couldn't help it. You buyin' the kid a new wardrobe... I told you Regret paid for the kid's clothes, didn't I? Mmm. I know. I suppose if you'd have been there, you'd have sent them back. Why not? All that dough for... All right, tightwad. Why the disguise? Aw, lay off him. Can't a guy wear a different suit without startin' a riot? Was you lookin' for something, Copper? Yeah. The kid. Another kid get lost? No, it's the same kid. One of them orphan societies is on our neck. You know. Afraid she might have fallen into the hands of the wrong people. Got time to take a run up to that new apartment of yours? What for? That ticket ties you in. I've got to take a look around your place. You know. Just for the record anyway. All right. We was just fixin' to get something to eat. Yeah. All right, I'll... I'll wait for ya. Give me the keys. But... Quick. Go to the bar and stall him. Where are they? In the bedroom, Mr. Jones. Say... You're telling me. Gee, don't you wish you could sleep like that? I can, without wishin'. You probably snore. Oh, so you listened, huh? Have a drink? Thanks. Reardon searched my place. He's sending a woman from one of them orphan societies tomorrow. You mean you can't take her back to your place? If they find her, they may get wise to the frame up on Dream Prince. Well, you can't leave her here. Afraid of the cops? No. Then what? I'm afraid of the kid. I don't want her here. I'm not going sappy over her. I won't! See? You're already sappy over her. But you're not? She's just something I can't get rid of, because... she's tangled up in a race deal. Wasn't tangled up in a deal the first night. You could have unloaded her. You didn't stage no riot when she busted up your song at the nightclub. - You read King Arthur to her. - You take her out and buy new clothes. And you stood still for the bite without even being chloroformed! All right, I did pay! Her clothes were falling off her. Oh, Sorrowful. I'm like you. I don't wanna admit it. The way she's gotten to... us. She's given me a chance to get to you. I've been crazy about you for a long time. Oh, everything is different. Maybe that's part of... of going sappy. I used to call you names, but now... it's like you're somebody else. Not Sorrowful. A different guy. In a new suit. I know lots of swell-looking suits walking around. We're forgetting I'm Steve's girl. Steve's out of town. And when he comes back? I was just lookin' after ya. See? Steve will never know. Well, that keeps my record clean. My record for always guessing wrong. Now, get out! Take it away. Don't want no mush. Scram! But Miss Bangles said you always to have a hot breakfast. Aw, what does she know? What's the matter, Marky? Tryin' to hand me mush. Don't you like it? No! Say, no, thank you. Say it like this: No, thank you, Bangles. I don't care for any. What for? You used to say "thank you" and "no, thank you. " I used to be a sissy. Now, where did you get that? Ain't tellin'. And I don't want no mush! Don't you like me anymore? Well... You used to like me when I was Lady Guinevere. There ain't no Lady Guinevere. Oh, yes, there is, dear. Just like there's a charger. There ain't no charger. But you saw him. They took him away. Well, maybe they'll bring him back if you remember to say "thank you"? Well, maybe I will stand for some mush. Thank you. Some cream? A little. Please. There's two gentlemen to see you all, Miss Bangles. Hiya, palsy-walsies! Hi, Marky, old scouterino. We were told to bring you this. What are ya eatin'? Mush? Baby food. I ain't eatin' it. I don't care for any. Thank you. That's better, honey. Imagine making a kid say "tanks" for mush. She's makin' a sissy out of her. So that's where she got this stuff! Well, she's not going with you. Now, beat it! She said, "Beat it!" I wanna go with them. No, honey. They's gone. Is you gonna keep her? A girl in my racket? Hey, what's the idea? I've been double-crossed. And I'm goin' back to New York to ask somebody a few questions. dd Hey, why so high-hat? Sit down. Dropped in to say I'm sorry about, uh... Forget about the other night. I wanted to see you too. Just coffee, please. Same here. Yes, sir. Goin' for someone in a big way? Thought you looked kind of undressed without 'em. Thanks for changing your mind about the kid. It's only for a few days more. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Do you remember those dizzy fairies she used to have? King Arthur and his mob? They're gone. We gypped her out of them, and now she's just a mug... like us. What's the matter with that? When we first met her, she was a sweet kid. Nice people would have been glad to have her, but now she hasn't got a chance. Because she's a little tough now? She's plenty tough. They want kids who have been brought up right. Who does? Nice people. You know, young married couples who have no kids of their own. Why don't you get nice and adopt her? 'Cause I'm not a young married couple. You'd love to see her get a good home, wouldn't you? Yeah, sure. Well, she won't. Not unless we can change her back to what she was. Read the book to her. That won't work. We showed her Big Steve's plug and called it the charger. We told her it was hers, then snatched it away from her. That started her off, and now, she doesn't believe anything about King Arthur anymore. She's got to be shown. Let her take another look at the horse. And King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Yeah, but where you gonna get them? I got it figured out. Come on. Oh, decided to get democratic and mingle with the riff and the raff, huh? I'm inviting you all to a party. You gonna pour tea, Duchess? It's a kid party, kind of. Will we have rattles and toy balloons to play with? Listen, Sorrowful has okayed it. Yep. It's to give the kid a break. Introduce her to society, huh? No, get her back on speaking terms with those fairies she used to have. We'll dress up as... As what? Sir Galahad, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, Sir Percivale... Me social calendar is filled for the season. Oh, please. It's for the kid. Let them as will, swim channels and such for their kiddies. But I will never dress up as Sir Percivale. You've got to! In English, in German, in French, in Italian, yes, even in Scandinavia, the answer is no! Get me some more beer! I want some beer! I want some beer now. Listen, you mugs! Keep quiet! Pay attention! You're Knights of the Round Table, and you gotta play straight for the kid. This is her party. She's gonna get a kick outta seeing her storybook fairies come to life. - You gotta act according. - According to what? According to the hop that Bangles read ya outta this book. You're supposed to be regular knights. Quiet, quiet, quiet! Before we get goin', does anybody want to know anything else? Yes, there is one thing I would like to know. What? What am I doin' here? I'm sorry, but the club is reserved for a private party tonight. Who waits without? Two knights for the Round Table. Two knights for the Round Table. Two knights for the Round Table. Pray have the two knights enter. What an extraordinary party. Enter two knights for the Round Table. I would like to know as follows: How we gonna get this hardware back to the museum? We'll throw the suits in the river. But we gotta remember one thing. What's that? First we gotta get outta the suits. That's a good idea. I'm glad you thought of it. Hello, Bugs! Why, you dirty... Ooh! Do that when I'm lookin', will ya? dd Pipe down! Pipe down! The princess! Welcome, Princess, to the Round Table! We salute you, Princess, and would die for you. Go ahead. That would be something. These are all my brave knights, and this is Sir Lancelot. What's the big idea, Regret? I ain't Regret. I am Sir Lancelot. Why, dear, don't you see? All of your knights have come to life. Hooey! They ain't no knights. That makes it unanimous. But, look. Can't you see these are knights? Sure, you can tell as follows: Look at these tin suits. I agree with ya. Look at 'em. Why are they all dressed up in ash cans? She's too grown up. She's spoilin' our children's party. She was gonna get a big kick outta this, huh? We might as well wash this up and go home. It turns out we're givin' this clambake for ourselves. Can't be blamed for tryin', kid. Wait. There's still the charger. It cost us 25 bucks to bring the nag here. We might as well try it. Varlet! The charger! Varlet! The charger! The charger! You brought him back to me. Sir Sorry brought him back to you. Oh, Sir Sorry. Is he mine now? Mine? My very own? Yes. For always? Yes. L... I didn't know you liked me. Well, I... But I... I always liked you. Want to kiss me? Well, I ain't runnin' for mayor. Give. You are Sir Galahad, the greatest one of all. And you are the Kind Keeper. Thank you, Princess. May I ride him now? Why, of course, Princess, and all my brave knights will follow you. d East side, west side d d All around the town d d The cops play ring the rosie d d London Bridge is falling down d d Boys and girls together d dMe and Mamie O'Rourke d d We trip the light fantastic d d On the sidewalks of New York d dEast side, west side d What's the matter, Doc? You heard what she said about me, the Kind Keeper. Yeah? And tomorrow morning I'm going to shoot that into her charger's neck. It'll make him win the race, but it'll kill him. Kill him? So that Steve can buy more bangles for his Lady Guinevere. You give me that. Get out. dd Are you going to kill her horse? To a kid, one horse is like another. But there couldn't be another. He's something she believes in again. I can't throw 50,000 away for a little doll. Reardon said he was afraid the kid would fall into the hands of the wrong people. It looks like she has. I thought maybe he was wrong. But it was me who was wrong. I could have gone for you. I thought maybe you had changed, you had a decent streak in you, but you haven't. You're not even halfway decent. Take your 50 grand. Take a million grand! Take all the dough in the world. But you'll always be just what you are, the cheapest skate on Broadway! d I'll never go there anymore d d The bowery The bowery d d They say such things and they do great things d d On the bowery The bowery d d I'll never go there anymore d d The bowery d Who closed my joint? Sorrowful bought it out for a party. Know anything about this? "You better come back and ask Bangles some questions. Sarah. " Who's Sarah? She's the maid I got planted in Bangles' apartment. What do you know? All I know, Boss, is that I'm supposed to be a fairy. dd Just get back? Yeah! d How happy we'll be d Ahead of time, ain't ya? Yeah. Who brought that horse in here? I did. Hey! Y'all gone crazy? Get that kid off that horse. No, please, Steve. - Get off! - He is my charger. Stay back, Steve. Marky! Whoa! Whoa! Marky! Marky! She was having such a good time. Doctor? Her condition is critical. Internal injuries. Dr. Ingalls is on his way to Gramercy Park Church. Of course. I'd forgotten. He's getting married tonight. Who's Dr. Ingalls? A child's surgeon. Is he the best? Best in the world. dd Well, Doctor, it'll be any moment now. I feel as though I were about to perform my first operation all over again. I mean, stage fright. dd Come on. Dr. Ingalls? Yes? I'm going to be married! You can get married anytime! And she stayed over to his place one night. And he gave her back the ice, huh? Yes, sir. Hey, Boss, ain't that kind of risky around a hospital? Shut up. With a flock of doctors around? Doctors ain't gonna do him any good. You stay here. We'll have to do a transfusion at once. Yes, Doctor. Please, tell me. It's transfusion. You'd better all come along for a blood test. Of course. Won't any of us do? None of you match. Why, there's Dr. Ingalls. This is magnificent of you. Magnificent! This gentleman has explained the situation. Phone Gramercy Park Church. Tell them I'll be back as soon as possible. Yes, Doctor. The bloods don't match. Get group two immediately. Is it a transfusion for the baby? Yes. Try us. Of course. Come on. Pulse is failing. We can't operate until we find a donor. Oxygen. No go. None of you'll do. We've located a professional donor. He'll be here in 15 minutes. That'll be too late. Never mind. You two played a nice little game. Steve. Take your hand out of your pocket, Steve. Just your hand. Is this another volunteer? Why, yes. All right. Send him in. What's the idea? Get in that room, Steve. Inside. Take off your coat, Steve. What is this? Sit down and roll up your sleeve. They match. Come with me, please. Hurry up, Steve! Come on. We found a donor, Doctor. Good. Bring him in. In you go, Steve. Lie down here, please. Okay. L... I got a lot of nerve comin' to You now. But I'm doin' it for her. Don't let anything happen to her. Don't seem like she ought to die. Give her a break. She's such a little doll. I'm not asking anything for myself. Not a thing. I'm sorry for everything I said. You called me by the right name. I'm the cheapest skate on Broadway. You're the grandest guy I've ever known. If the kid lives, the three of us might... She's got to live. For us. Look. She's getting alive. Your blood is giving her life. My blood? Get a kick out of it? Giving life? Giving life. I can operate now and save her. Gee, that's swell. It's like I was her old man. You've got good blood. Me? Strong, good blood. Stop the oxygen. The Strong Knight. Is that all? Yes. And thanks. Well, the doll's gonna live. And you know why? 'Cause I got good blood. Well, Steve? From now on, he can buy them for ya. And don't forget! I've got good blood!
