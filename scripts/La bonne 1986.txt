Come on, Angela. Please don't. Come on, let's do it. Are you crazy? I don't want to get pregnant. Like this? Always the same. You would like that, eh'? Don't you dare, bastard. Finally. You're here! It was time. Mom! You know the doctor said you mustn't move around, right'? There's nobody at home. I felt bad, I needed air. - What's going on out there'? - Nothing, only students. How, students? I don't know, I think it's a manifestation. For Trieste? No idea. You know I don't care about these things. Well, you're not interested in these things. The maid returned finally. She made it. They have too much freedom. They do what they want. - Damn maid! - Mom! - Need help'? - Thanks. I can do it. Be careful! - Angela, go and eat. - Thank you, sir. That maid... In my time they had to wait until the owners had finished eating. Mom, I told you many times I don't like that word. Yes, democracy! - Honey, how was your day'? - Good. As usual. I'm so thirsty. - You shouldn't drink so much. - Shh! I don't understand. ...The Prime Minister announced in an appeal to Hungary and the world. After arrival by car, I went to the Hotel Duna where the foreign journalists stayed. Betrayed by the Russians and caught off guard, we didn't know what to do and what would happen to brave and unfortunate people. We managed to reach the Italian legation just before the patriots opened fire. - I wanted wine. - You know it's not good. Yes, but I like it. Do they want to recreate the Austro-Hungarian Empire? I don't know. Budapest has turned into in a battlefield, patriots control the streets with machine guns and cannons. - Thanks. - MIG15s flying over the city amplified the atmosphere of terror and replaced the enthusiasm of the crowd with in a few hours. - Thanks. - Russian tanks in Via Dohany immobilized a couple of vehicles. The population tried to hide in cellars. - Going out tonight? - A meeting at the City Council, I'll be back late. - Don't wait for me. - Okay. A group of students resisted for three days at the road cross... - Is he going out tonight? - He went to a meeting. What do you know'? If you would give him a son, he wouldn't go out every night with those godless communists. Pointless... Unnamed heroes have fought and given everything until the very last, in order to delay the Russian tanks. There were no real war fronts, but any moment the whole town could become a battlefield. You scared me. Is there a problem'? Mom'? No. - I just wanted to thank you for... - Never mind, forget it. - I said nothing about Pernon. - Don't talk about it. You're very good to me. - What are you doing? - I help you. I like brushing hair. When I was little my mother used to do it for me for hours. Later I did it for my brothers. I had eight of them. We didn't have a bathroom at home. We bathed in a wooden tub in the kitchen. I liked to stand there, in the hot water, it made me feel so beautiful. Just that I couldn't do it so often. We were so many, I had to wait for my turn. - Are you cold? - No. I'm not cold. Like this. Turn around now. Here, signora, selected quality. Look, signora, beautiful vegetables. I bought flowers. Do you like them'? From the field. - Is anything wrong? - Put them in the dining room. - Perhaps you prefer other flowers. - No, I like them so simple. - I really like my land. - Your land? It is as if it was mine, I grew up there. - Do you miss it'? - A little. I don't want to hurt you, people must love a land. - I don't know how to say it. - Don't worry. I've an idea, next time I go home, you come along. - What do you say'? I can't. - Why not'? My mother-in-law can't be left alone. - Then there's Giacomo. - No, don't think about it. A signora shouldn't do those things... What do you call it'? - Change the sheets? - Can't you put her in a hospital? - No, I can't. - Yes you can. It's not good to be locked in the house. Brother! - Mom is inside. - Mom, Angela is back! Let me go! - I wanna play too! - Please! Stop it! Come on, children, play outside. Out you go! Apologies, signora. I don't know if she can do it. Have you never tried? Please. I'm too curious, dear! Let her do it alone, don't bother. - The chestnuts are ready. - Hurray! Great! Don't burn yourself, there are enough for everyone. Here you are. Come on, quick! - You don't drink, signora'? - It is very good, home-made. - Why don't you drink? - I've been drinking. But I don't tolerate so much. - Admit that she's sympathetic. - She is beautiful. Yes, you're lucky. She's a great signora. Beautiful, isn't she? Children, out, in the yard. Enough now! - What's your name? - Reply to the signora. Do you like children'? How many do you have? - I'm sorry about earlier. - It's nothing. Don't get upset about it. You heard what my mother said? You'll have beautiful children. Don't give up hope. Do you believe what your mother says? Why not'? She's very good. Many people ask her advice. They come from far away. - This talisman will help? - Sure. You must keep it close to your heart, every night. As children we used to hide here. They never found out. We were here for hours. When it got dark, we were afraid to go down. - Afraid of what? - Of pounding. Smell. Have you ever tried fresh milk? It very good. You drink first. How nice. Looks abandoned, right'? But no, it's just asleep. Angela, I think I drank too much wine. That doesn't harm, it is so light. - Come in the water. - No. - Come on! - Stop it, I have bathed! Come on. I was always here as a child. I loved to watch myself in the water. We had no mirrors in the house. Only here I could see my body. Have you watched yourself down there'? No. I don't think I have. I went to a convent school. We were swimming with huge shirts. It was forbidden to look at a naked body. Look at me. Look at yourself. What do you see'? Nothing. Take off your panties. Spread your legs. Touch yourself. Isn't it good? The awful events in Hungary were not at all caused by reactionary... The Magyar people rebelled against oppression with the sole intention to regain freedom. Like the people of East Berlin and Poznan. It is appropriate that our city shares the pain with the generous people of Hungary. Why Vicenza, having fought 1948 in the Perun dream of freedom... - It's absurd! - It's a shame! Vicenza is qualified to appreciate and admire all this struggle and suffer. - Liar! - I ask the word. Silence! The word has councilor Anselmi. Our party, while admitting that the Hungarian people have gone through a period of economic hardship, believes that we should clearly state that the responsibility for this situation is only caused by... - Let him speak! The inability of the leaders... and not by socialism itself! Let me speak! We don't accept that the right to protest against what happened in Hungary and we agree with the hard, but necessary, military intervention by the Government and the Soviet people. Watch out! Don't spoil it. How is it'? - How is what? - Very yellow'? You give me too many vitamins. You have to stop it. They stink! - Need anything else? - No, no! I'm late. Honey, I was just taking a shirt from the drawer. The money's gone. Do you know anything? I remember well, I put 50000 Lire there the other day. The money'? Oh yes, I took it. I wanted to buy a gift for my sister's birthday. Please forgive me. - You could have told me. - Yes, sorry. I just forgot. - Ciao, Mom. - Ciao. Take care. - Ciao dear. - Ciao darling. If you came to thank me for this morning, it's no need. I don't wanna know what you did with that money. However, this is the last time I protect you. I didn't want to talk about it. He received the subpoena yesterday. It's a delicate case and it must be treated intelligently. I wish you'd defend him. Why me'? We've always been on opposing sides. What's the problem'? It's about defending a boy who has been a little exuberant. You can go to one of my colleagues... You are the best lawyer in town. - And my son... - Your son resisted arrest. He punched a cop and had a knife on him. Unfounded allegations. There's no witness. Don't you need an evidence'? I only ask you to do your work and defend him. You don't need to pray. After all, it's a simple case, and I'm here because I trust you. If you accept, I can sleep peacefully. I will think about it. - Shall we'? - Yes, of course. - Good night, Angela. - Good night, sir. - Anna! - Yes, here I am. - Good night. - Good night, signora. Have you called more for that house? Actually, no. I was very busy. Is it so urgent? Do you hate it so much'? It's not that. I don't hate it at all. - My mother'? - No. It's so much your house. I would prefer one that is ours. - A house we choose together. - I'll do it first tomorrow. - I promise, okay? - Okay. Tell me. Are you contented with Angela at home'? Do you think she is the right person'? Why do you ask'? Has something happened? I just wondered. We never talked about it. I wanted to know what you thought. Are you sure you don't hide anything? If anything has happened, I'd rather know it now. Is this about you and her or about mom'? Nothing has happened, really. I was only wondering. What do you think? I think... she's a good girl. She's very patient with mom... What can I say'? - Pour me some wine, please? - Of course. I'm sorry for the delay. I didn't realize the time. It's no big deal. The keys. - There's someone at home anyway. - What do you want'? The water's finished. May I have some water'? What's up? '5 anything wrong? You shouldn't drink so much. It's not good for you. Time for the medicine. Who is it'? Can't you tell me'? - It's about Angela. - So what? Come on, don't do that. You know you have to take it. I read the package leaflet. They cause arteriosclerosis. - Please. - I don't need that crap! In my days those pills didn't exist, and people were healthier. - Okay. Do what you like! - Just call if you need anything. - But... Then'? What's going on here'? - Signora... - My husband. I'll put them aside. Carlo came with new cigarettes. Try to get ready soon. - You've got to go. - Just one moment. - I'll be fired. You've got to go. - Come here. Please, Carlo. If you send me away, I'll never come back. - Who was it'? - A cousin of Angela. Now the waitresses also have visitors. It's just a relative. He'll leave soon. - Did you take the medicine? - Yes, I did. So what is this? Do you understand that it's for your own good? Can you read the newspaper? Yes, Mom. Now you must go. Sorry, I can't leave now. Please, Carlo, no! That turns me on. Are you crazy? Leave me, please. Shall I start with Hungary or other news? I don't care about Hungary. I'm only interested in obituaries. Okay. Carlo, please. Not now. I can't, I gotta go. Go now. Come on, let me in. Just for a moment. Please. When we go out on Saturday I'll do everything you want. I can't wait, I get mad. Please let me in. Annamaria and Antonio remember with sorrow the departure of their beloved father, Emilio at the first anniversary of his death. These are certainly nice children. Go on. Now you can't do anything. I can look at you. Okay, have a good look. But don't touch. And promise to leave afterward. I promise. - I understand, but when was he born'? - What? Ah, I didn't tell it. It says only that he died. I know he's dead. I'm not senile! Well, I don't care that I don't know. More. - More'? More! A little more. - Do you like me'? - Yes, you're beautiful. Now I want to watch you. Me'? Let me see. More. Yes... More. Come closer. - Ciao, Stella. - Hey! Keep your hands off! Come on, tell another one. I only know dirty ones. Maybe the signora doesn't like it... We thank Angela's landlord to whom we owe her presence. So great she's here with us. - You like to dance'? - Yes, I'm a good dancer. I'm not kidding, let's have a dance. - Give me a kiss. - Leave me alone! Signora? Wait a moment. Shall we take a ride'? No. Seen my beautiful car'? Why don't you stop? I'm only offering you a ride. Leave me alone! Signora. Look... Signora! Listen. Signora. - Excuse me. Signora. - Please, go away! Excuse me. It's not what you think. - Did you see the car'? - I'll call a guard! - Your wife. - My wife'? Anna. Hello'? But where are you'? Are you okay? I'm in the center. In town. I'm in a cafe. I took a walk. No, I just wanted to tell you. No. H ow? Nothing happened. I said no. Nothing happened. Can't you meet me'? - I'm in a council. - Giacomo! Where are you'? They've started to vote Hurry up! How do you say'? Listen, I gotta run. See you at home. Okay. Bye, darling. Kisses. See you later. They have a slight majority. Many councillors are absent. How can you defend the son of Bertini'? Unbelievable! You of all. Why not'? It's like any other case. I'm a lawyer. - I left the folder by the phone. - Hurry up! I'll be right back. Let's try it. No. It's too uncomfortable. Come on, yes. That's it. Good.. It's pointless to lock you in. Open the door, or I'll smash it! Do you hear me'? I'm not joking. Open up! Open up! Here I am, signora. You don't like my friends family, cause it isn't as fine as yours. But I really like them. These people are honest. Do you understand, signora'? And I've thought you were a friend. I always try to please you. And you'? Run away without a word, and leave me there like an idiot. Of course! What do you care for me'? You are the signora and you'll be never alone. But I don't have to put up with that. Is that clear'? Do you understand? Bitch! Why don't you leave me alone? What do you want'? I don't want anything! Have I ever asked you'? I don't want anything! Perhaps we make it until tomorrow morning. But the machines must run all night long. Too expensive. Tell him that. You can go now. All right. - Giovanna! - Anna! Do you remember having a sister? - It's so long ago! - I know. - It's such a long time. - Sorry. How glad I am to see you! Have you ever visited me here'? - No. - What do you think? - Eh... - How's Giacomo? - Well. - As usual? - Laughing all the time, eh'? - Yes. I'm sorry, you came to talk with me. - Yes. - You know how it is. What's up? - It's that... - There's too much noise here... come. How glad I am to see you. It is difficult to explain. It seems so... - Angela... - Angela? - Who's that? - My maid. Your maid? I have 30 workers under me, all men, and you've a problem with one maid? Be more rigorous. Look at me. They listen to me. It's quite simple, try it out! Mind the stairs. They're slippery. Sure, there's the problem with the mother, but I'm used to it. We're looking for another house. Sooner or later... But it's not this. Giacomo is so... Giacomo is Giacomo. He's your husband and loves you. Have patience with him. You have a house, a husband... you don't know what it means be all alone. Last night I suddenly woke up with terrible stomach ache. I was terrified, I didn't know what to do. I felt the need of someone close to me, someone to talk to. Maybe it's my fault. I swear, I can't handle it any more. What can I tell you'? I'm tired. I'm so tired. Tired of this life, the mill, all the dust I breathe in every day. But I have nothing else. Well, you have a lot of responsibility, but also many rewards. Maybe, but... Is it really worth it'? I'm asking you. - Signorina... - Yes? A pasta customer is waiting downstairs. Yes, everything is ready. Write a receipt. He wants to talk to you. Do I always have to do everything myself? Excuse me. I'll be right back. - But no, tell him to wait. - Yes signora. Honey, do you remember the eternal quarrel I had with Dad? God rest his soul. They say I was a headstrong. If he could see me now! Unfortunately, we resemble so much. The party has underestimated the trend towards increased well-being and, admittedly, towards freedom. Try not to get confused, the workers haven't acted yet. Right. They were agents provocateurs, collaborators of the Nazis... The usual stuff. Nostalgic Admiral Horty. Admiral of what actually? There's no ocean in Hungary. Mario, I don't rely on these rumors, I only watch what happened. The tanks everywhere. I don't understand on which side you are! If you want to win you must promise that people can buy the 600, and let their children study. Italy today is a country with great possibilities. - More wine, Mario'? - No, thank you. It is very good, but I've enough today. People want to buy cars, but we can't rely on the working class that dreams of a 600. - More wine'? The ideas of the working class aren't the same any more. Expectations are decreased. The war has been over for more than 10 years and I no longer believe it. Times have changed. That's just an alibi for those who got used to the good life. What do you say'? Since when is living well a crime'? Ah, well! - We're back... - We're going back to private interests, Having servants, for example. - We never used that word. - But you've got one. - May I serve coffee, signora'? I'll call you when it's time, and please don't interrupt when people talk. - Is that clear'? - Yes, signora. Excuse me, signora. I was distracted. - Would you like anything else? - No, thank you. You've changed, Giacomo. Seriously. - You really changed. - Not true. - I'm only doing my work. - Making lots of money. You want to fight? I can understand a lot of things, but not defending a fascist, and at the same time vote to help those in Budapest. - I didn't vote for Perloro! - No, you escaped! Excuse me! - Angela, what have you done'? - It's nothing. I'm so sorry. Go back in the kitchen. I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. If you're tired, you can go to bed. Tomorrow is your last day. - Hey, are you crazy? - What's going on'? - Anna! - It's nothing! She broke a plate. I'll be back soon! - I help Angela a little. - Need a hand? No, thank you. It will go fast. Help me collecting the pieces. Get a bucket. 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100! Angela, where are you'? Angela! I don't like it here, is so dark! Where are you'? I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Angela! Leave me! You hurt me... - How many hands? - How do I know'? - And how many now'? - Twelve. No, you make me fall! Angela! I feel dizzy. Where are you'? No! I'll get you! Ah! Anna! Enough! Enough! If you don't want to play, you just take off the blindfold. Oh, my God! She is dead! No... It's not my fault. No... It's not my fault. I don't know. It's not my fault. You I know that's not my fault. I didn't know. It's not my fault. - Can't you come with me'? - Please, it's a long trip. You better go alone. I'll call you tonight, okay? - I understand. - Good. Signora, wait. Don't you remember me'? - Why do you ignore me'? - I don't know you! - Leave me alone! - No, look... Hello'? Giacomo! How are you'? Is everything all right'? What? No, I'm fine. I fell asleep in front of the TV. Are you tired? How so'? I agree. Try to cheer you up, honey. I agree. Don't worry. Good night, love. Good night. - Angela, but... - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up, damn it! It's okay, stop it. Please. Ahhh! Stay calm. Why are you so stubborn'? Why're you doing that? Lights off, idiot! Come on. Help me! Calm down, honey. Come here. - What's that? - Try. Don't worry. I'm a pharmacist, it doesn't hurt. Try it. You'll love it. What shall we do'? Unbind her. Are you sure she won't scream again? She'll stay calm, don't worry. You don't want your husband to know how his mother died, right'? Lift her petticoat. Higher, I want to see more. Good. Here we are, that's enough. And now, turn around. Take off your clothes. Caress yourself. Good, bravo. Kiss me. - Do it, come on! - No. Come on... Hello'? Who? No, you got the wrong number. You're welcome. Hello'? No. I was still in bed. No, I feel good. Of course. What? At 11:00'? I agree. See you at the station. See you later, honey. Okay. Ciao. Lie down, please. Enough is enough. Now I want to fuck you. No! - spread Your leg I s. - No! - Don't be stupid, nothing happens. - You're not a virgin, are you'? - No! There you are! You started this game, bitch! No! You see'? It's not that terrible. Don't come into me, please! No! You asked for it. You asked for it. Isn't this the home of lawyer Menegatti? - Yes. May I ask why'? - What? - They're moving out. - Couldn't they pay? - No, she got pregnant. - Really? Typical country girl. And then they cry for help. - They're all whores, my dear. - Oh, yes. - I have to run. Goodbye. - Good luck. Thanks, likewise. Anna, don't exhaust yourself. Take it easy. You know that I can't stand just sitting around. I must keep myself busy. I can't hear anything. What a fool! What do you expect? It's just two months. Mom would be so happy. I know. I'll go. Yes? Good day, signora. The agency has sent me. My name is Isabella. I shall give you this letter. - Who is it'? - It's the new maid. Please come in. I'll show you your room.
