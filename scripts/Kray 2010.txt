Everyone's at work! What about you? I'm in charge of the music. So you've been posted here as head mechanic. Suits me, you can be my right hand man. Lost my arm in '43. How many trains do you have here? One - an 'AU' model. And there's one from another village. I'll take the 'AU' then. No you won't! Says here you're banned from driving trains. If you don't give me the train, I'll just move on. There's nowhere else to go... This lot are all traitors. A rotten bunch. They were relocated here from the German camps. Who knows what they did with the Fascists... ...maybe bombs intended for Moscow. You - you're one of kind in these parts! - What 'kind' is that? - A war hero! A winner! - What about you? - I'm in charge here. I make them see the error of their ways! They were all sent here before the war ended for 'correction'. This isn't a camp though. We've no guards. No need - nowhere else to go! Fomich! Fomich! Signed those papers for me? What? The request for extra rations for my little Pasha? What are you shouting at me for? Don't call me 'Fomich', call me 'Citizen Kolivanov.' I'm sick of you and your signature requests. Slow down! Stop! Here! Give that to her. Hello! So then, war hero? You ready to be my right hand? Why didn't you close the pressure valve, eh? Engine driver! That's enough, Stepan! Hand it over. We need someone we can trust in here. Throw some more coal on! Who's in charge? Comrade Stalin! He spent the entire war arse-licking the Germans. - The Estonian bastard! - I'm a Lithuanian bastard. Well?... What' your name? Butkus. You ever check this? The suspension's all rusted. Buktus! What kind of fucking mechanic are you? (In German) I put this engine together from scratch... I... Learn Russian! Stop working! Our ''new boss'' will finish the rest! Stop! I said stop! Where are you pushing that? Let's go. HURRAY!!! VICTORY!!! Follow my finger. Dizzy? You lost consciousness. Collapsed in a fit. Can't see shit now. I see everything. - Ever had concussed? - Twice. You stink of home-made alcohol. Disinfectant. Home-brew's useful for almost everything. In hospital, they gave me morphine for the pain. Want some more? If Hitler had knocked back a few shots of home-brew in 1941, maybe he'd never have started the war against us. He'd have woken up in his bunker next to his woman with a hell of a hangover and thought, ''Who needs a fucking war?! Who gives a shit about the Jews?!'' Here's some 'morphine'... and something to help it down. - Krasnoselskiy?! - Here. Golovina! Where's Golovina? We thought she's having a lie-in at your place! Your Golovina ran away! She'd have to go the length of the Taiga to run away. Not enough real men here so she went off with the bear, Fomich... I mean Citizen Kolivanov! You just wait! All of you just wait. Fishman will be here soon; he'll give you something to laugh about. - Efremov! Have you dozed off again? - Here! Here's what you asked for. And some home-brew! Half a bottle. Why only half? I had a tiny, tiny drop. Oh! It's German! Couldn't you find a decent one anywhere? It's the best one in these parts. Those are nice flowers in your pot. What are you staring at? You asking me out on a date? I'm not so sure, my mama mightn't like it. Karlusha! Come back here! She's got a nerve bringing him in here. So where's your mama then? Funny. Come on. We're new here, haven't settled in yet. My little Pasha's woken up. Sit down, come in. I have to tie him to the table so he won't crawl away. Come on, wake up. He still doesn't want to speak, but he can walk. Put the pot down. Where did I put it? Here! He gets sick a lot, so the medic gave me this to help him. I'm the only one with a child, that is why they gave me a separate room. Pashka, what are you doing? Come here. He likes biting. He likes biting. He'd be better off learning to speak! Sit down. What's your name? - Ignat. - That's a beautiful name. I'm Sofie, that's what my employers in Germany called me. I worked as a servant near Potsdam. I'm not from the camps. See, no number! Pasha was born there. Here, eat, eat. I fell in love there... Let's drink. What's wrong with you? Must have been difficult being 'under' the Germans? Get out! I'm not going anywhere. How do you put up with it? First he takes your train, then your Sofia. Let's say I chickened out! Bastard! What's wrong? - Is it that long since you've been with a woman? - That long. Don't worry. That's not important. Touch me. Touch me like this, and this. Like that. Like that. Kiss me. Kiss me. Like that, come on. Come on, lick me, suck. Like that, and like that. Look at me. Look. You're so good. Gnasha-Gnasha, and you said you were concussed! Wait. Is the rope secure? Come on girls, grab it! - Tonya, don't drop your end. - Fuck off! When you grow balls enough to be the boss, you can give the orders! Balls? All he does in bed is sleep! And snore. Don't be jealous!! Enough chit-chat! Get a move on! We have to wait for the other train to pass. Switch the tracks. And go in the wrong direction? We'll just go with the flow. - Take it easy up there. - It wasn't so scary when Stepan was driving! (Sarkisyan is singing in Armenian) Let's see what we have here! Aha! Here, take these! Could have got them to lay a few more, Sarkisyan! My little girls do the best they can. I'll feed you now. How about that, my little beauties? Those chickens have made you crazy. Slow down! You're scaring them! Let's catch up on them. They've got chickens up there. If we catch them, we can eat the chickens. Throw on more coal. Look at that! They're trying to overtake us. Faster! Those runts won't get past us! Don't you know the rules? You're not allowed go the wrong way down the tracks. They say you took everything from Stepan. Shame, he was the only decent engine driver here. Apart from me. They also say you get fits. That you're banned from driving trains. They say you can milk a chicken! Sarkisyan, I'll steal your chickens! You're a nasty son of a bitch. You little shit! I fucked your mother! And your grandmother! I haven't seen an egg since I left the orphanage! Enough bullshit! More coal! Throw on some more! Throw on some more coal! More! Throw on some more! Throw on some more coal! More! Throw on some more! I said more! We can't go any faster. The log-car's full of women! I said more! You're a shit driver! Slow down! What are you doing? Stop! We said stop! What are you doing? Stop! We said stop! You know you'll go to prison? Fishman'll put you away once he gets here! Not just for racing the train, but for wrecking it too! You fought on the Frontline! We depend on people like you! There are fucking food shortages everywhere - starvation. The military's requisitioned all means of transport! How am I supposed to feed these traitors now? Many broke their backs to get that train working. And you? All you care about is speeding on the wrong side of the tracks! You pushed the engine pressure over the limit! - I didn't go over any limits. - Why did the valve explode then? Saboteur! And concussed! - Uncoupled, could have done 70! - What?! Did you unscrew the valve? Maybe I did. What's the point in destroying the engine? Better to hit me over the head. What's the point? Why do you need Sofia so badly? She's a trophy! Come on! Take me on! Cool off, stoker! Throw some more coal on. Here. Have a drink! I never drink on the job. Fine, but I rarely offer anyone a drink. I sell all sorts of stuff, home brew and other things. Dried fish. Nobody's buying though. But a steam engine... a steam engine would fetch a good price. What did you say? I forgot to tell you. There's a dead person living on the island. Completely, totally dead. Stole my gun, my matches. Even stole salt from me. Stole salt, and my matches. Go and kill him again! There's a bridge to the island. It's just a little bit broken. Push! It was broken when the ice cracked in the Spring. Completely broken! Take the lantern! Gnasha, I put some tobacco in your pocket. The bridge's broken there! He forgot his pot. Take that medal off your hat, loser! I swapped it for the train... fair and square! Bitch! It's alive... Where's your Ignat then? He's gone for now, but he'll be back. He told you he'd be back? Women! Women! Don't take me for an idiot! Your life seems to me to be a bit pointless. First some German, then Stepan. Love tends to come to the winners in life. Aren't there any other men you'd consider good enough for you? Who do you consider good enough then? So what if I'm missing an arm. Your 'hero's run away. From everyone. Thinks as he fought on the Front he can do whatever he wants. Don't give me any of that! Fomich, don't start that again! It's not right! Wait, just wait! Fishman will sort out all this sabotage one way or another. I'm telling you! For Ignat, I'd cut off your other arm in an instant. Get down from there! (In German) Get me out of here you idiot! Bastards! They even got this far! Get me out of here! Dry off! Take that off. Take off those rags. Concussed?! Shit! (In German) Work! Let's heat this place up. You little bastard! It's alive. Approaching the outpost of Krai, Siberia. December 1940. (In German) Gustav, let me give you some advice. You'd be better of being an engineer. It's a great honour for me to be your assistant, Mr. Haneke. Your bridge over the Rhine is simply magnificent. Elsa also wants to become an engineer, although I have to say, I prefer it when she sings. Ain't going to be very interesting for you here, Fraulein Elsa. I'm going to help my father. To mark your father's arrival here, even renamed the village main-street 'Lenin Strasse'! - Where are you going? - Where. Over there. To count fir trees. What happened? What did he say? He's gone for a piss. Piss. We'll wait then. 'Possat' - what does that mean? He has some... business here. How talented you are, Gustav. You've only been here a week, and you already speak Russian. Won't even let me have a piss. The brute. Vermin! Sarkisich, run! Run, Sarkisich! Get a move on! Get going, I'm telling you! As fast as you can! Go on! Get moving I said! - Did you piss? - Didn't have time! Gustav, it won't be boring here after all. Over there! Push in that direction! Tie in the log! Come on! Come on! Come on! Work! Take off your clothes and get dry! Take off your clothes and get dry! I'm better off having nothing to do with him, the pig. Comes here out of thin air and thinks he can give orders. You can't just bully your way in. This is the Taiga and not some street market! But maybe he'll get us out of here! Let go of the log, you idiot! There's enough wood here! You ok? Work! Further down! Lower! Nail it lower! No, even lower! Lower I said! There! - As low as possible. - Hard worker, aren't you! Who's there? Pashka, what's wrong with you? Come on, one spoon at least! Oh, it's you Stepan. Come on, Pashka. Stepan, pass the kettle. What's wrong? Why are you being so difficult? Come on, my sweet... - Pasha, eat up! - Here! Or we're never going on a train-ride anywhere together. - Just one, please. -Maybe I should stay. Are you crazy? I already have a man. Just one spoon... You used to have me I thought. Used to. Not anymore! Here, drink. Drink some more. What's so much better about him? He has more guts. Back! Back! Take it easy, or we'll fall in! Stop! Stop! Get on board! You can't go yet! It's too soon! Gustav will fall, the bridge won't hold him. We'll all end up in the water. If Gustav falls in, everything's lost! And we'll be left here. Do you hear me? Faster! Come on! Come on! Gustav, come on! Come on! Fuck off! Move! That's all there is... I've never seen a German girl like that before! I'll bring her to Kolivanov tomorrow. He can figure it out. There are no potatoes left. None! That's our pot. Give me that. Don't try to run things here. All the same it's our pot. Ow! You little rat! If you don't stop biting me, a huge bear will come and swallow you whole. Do you hear me? Hey, girls! He's laughing!! Look, he's laughing. Pasha will be speaking German too before you know it. The huge bear has huge teeth. He'll come and gobble you up! - What'll happen to her now? - Get her cleaned up. I'll find her some clothes. - And then what? - Then what? Help me. Why did you drag that wild animal to Krai? Does she understand Russian? Do you understand Russian? Verstehen Russian? She understands shit-all. - That's Gustav's briefcase. - Give it to me! It's Gustav's! Give it back! It's... it's not yours. It's Gustav's! I'll take it back sooner or later... That was good honey! - Can we leave her at the orphanage? - An orphanage? She's easily 20. Look at her. You'll be responsible for her from now on. I offer to help her find some clothes, and she smashes my jar of honey. That's fine, that's fine. Soon Fishman'll be here. He'll sort you all out. He'll send you all to the orphanages! What's wrong with you? What's up? What did you do with her there? I dragged a steam engine across the river. You dragged her, not the steam engine. You're so stupid. What's there to drag in her? Listen! Get up and go and wait in the barracks. Go on, get out of here! Greetings to Fishman! The outpost of Krai, Siberia, May 1941. - Where do the Germans? - Lenin Strasse 3. - Kovalev, you're in charge. - Yes sir! It's not our fault! The ice smashed the bridge. A force of nature... Then we'll have to punish the forces of nature as well. Keep in line! Today is the 13th of May, 1941. Everything else is a lie. I said get a move on! Kovalev, get them into the wagon. Come on, come on, get a move on! Clear the track! - Run! Elsa, run! - Halt, or I'll shoot! - Halt! - Halt, or I'll shoot! Elsa! - Run! - Papa! Where's the girl? Release the dogs! Two gifts in one - a steam engine, and a woman! Hey there, filthy girl. Quiet! Be quiet! Why are you all dressed up? You little bastard. Where did you dig up that smelly bitch? So many people... We need to add coal. Hey! Boss! Whose side did you fight on after all? On your little saboteur's side? Why do they all hate me so much? The pressure isn't holding. Something's not right. Take a look! It was out of action for too long. What's there to look at? The engine's a piece of shit. And it'll never do 50 kmph. Sure, but if you keep the valve open, it'll do more. I don't have time to fix it. We've a meeting today. To prepare for the winter. What's the point of a shitty meeting? Have a look, Uncle Tomas! This is important. Why did he hit you? For a good reason. Tell him I'm not going near that thing until he cleans it. - What's your name? - Elsa. You spent the whole war hiding in the Taiga? What war? Stop! Stop! Go back and we'll do it again. Turn it off! Back once more! Turn it off! Turn it off for fuck's sake! Turn it off! - Stop! - Turn off the water, you idiot! Stop! Look what the cat dragged in! What does Ignat see in her anyway? She's probably washing herself for your Ignat! Hello! Pasha's found a relative at last? Have you seen the immortal bear? Get out of here! Get out! Pasha, give me your hand. I said: out of here! Do you understand? I'll leave when I've washed! Now, you bitch! Sofia'll make minced meat of her! What did I tell you? Get out now! Leave me alone! And leave Ignat alone too! Come on, come on, come on! Get her... What? You all think I'd run away? That you'd scare me? I'll stay here as long as I want. Is that clear? Matilda! Pour... out... some hot soup! I need to eat. You took your time. There's nothing left! They've eaten everything. You forgot this. - I know everything about you. - Drunk! Soon you'll all get what you deserve. And you'll get what you deserve too. But it'll cost you. Hey, Matilda, let's set your dog on him. It can chew his balls off. Chew them off yourself. My dog isn't some camp mongrel like some of you. Who wants to drink a toast to my steam engine? Go and drink with your German girl. The engine driver! It's about time we found out which of us is fastest. Engine Driver! I didn't see you when we took the Reichstag! Bastard. Move out! What are you doing? What are you doing, you bastard! I need some air. Stop! Stop! You'll fall out! Another drunk... - Little Kraut! - Let me go! You're drunk! We crushed you Germans over and over, You're drunk! ...and now my own people won't even drink with me. It hurts when your own people don't want to share a drink with you. They're my people, little Kraut. So what if they're not heroes, they're my people. Before the war, I had it all - flowers, women, and the best steam engine in the world, the ''Joseph Stalin''! I got it up to 163 kmph. But I forced the pressure too high, and ''Stalin'' came off the tracks. That's why I have this hole in my head. I'm an invalid! I had to drink with the doctors for three days ...so they'd let me go to the Front. I should have drowned you on the island. I've never seen you smile. It suits you. Look at him. He's laughing. Laughing. I've nearly forgotten German already. Come here and show papa, Eat, eat up your soup. Why didn't you come home? Had a lot of work. Was it all about work for you before the war as well? How did your wife put up with it? Never got around to getting married. You never get around to anything. That's enough. Take some bread for your German girl. Everyone's making fun of us, saying you live with a wild animal. Don't listen to them! Take it easy, or your ''Gustav'' will fall apart. Not like that. Toss it in further. Further. Not like that, let me show you! Take it like this and toss it all the way in. There's a tree blocking the tracks! Get back! Get back! The bastards! Are we at war? Hi! Find me some sheet metal. Metal's very expensive. Is your medal here? Cheaper?! Think I wouldn't figure out who shot at us? You're the only one here with a gun that works. Who else was there? Matilda was there. Borka was there. Golovina was there. Bocharov was there. And there were others. The medic got drunk and was late. I shot at the dead one. The Dead One. The Dead One. Couldn't even put a hole in her. There's no way a girl can live in a train for 4 years. Check if her heart beats! Someone who's alive always has a heartbeat. You're an idiot, Vovka. I've seen 'dead people'. Stand! Sit! Stand! Sit! Stand! Sit! Put some effort in, Golovina! Stand! Sit! Stand, Bocharov! Sit! Stand! Enjoy it, Teterin! What are you sitting for! Stand! Sit! Stand! You still haven't pissed me off yet! Sit! Stand! Sit! Sit! If you've got the message, then take a rest! Karlusha! Karlusha! Karlusha, my little dog! The medic gave me some bear fat ointment. Relax! Now, like that. Good thing you got hit by a stone, and not a bullet. Look like the poster-soldier... Lie still. Like that. Like that. Like that. It's beating. Wait... Kiss me. Kiss me. What are you jumping around for? Goddamn night owl. No rest even at night. What are they up to? The bastards! It's bad to steal. Stealing is very bad. What the fuck is going on? Need to be in charge at night too? Keep out of it! It's not good to steal! Would you look at what's going on here! I'll sort it out... Will you now? Bastards! What kind of a man are you? He makes me do squats in the street, ...and then steals the roof. You'll sort it out!! - Where are you going? - Back to the barracks! - Get lost then! - Get lost yourself! Bastards! They're all bastards... We'll see! We'll sort it all out. Don't you get it... you're turning everyone against you because of your German girl. Don't push it! Don't look at me like that! Why did you strip the roof? Put that metal back! You stripped the roof, I can't believe it! Shame if you lost your other arm, right? Couldn't scratch your balls! People need bread now and not your stupid stubbornness. Is that clear? - That's Gustav's briefcase! - Where are you off to? Tomorrow you can bring her to the station and hand her over. That's an order! Now get out of here! Get out of here before it gets nasty! When will you pay me for the metal? Is this all there was? There's a lot of wood in the Taiga, but not so much metal. Nice one! Find a dress and some shoes. So... ''A report of damage to state property... and the concealment of a German girl''... Moscow! Moscow! Comrade Stalin!... Oh the bastards! Everything's a fucking mess, Comrade Stalin. I learnt how to drive a motorbike, how to caress a woman, how to be in charge of people. But I never learnt to write with my left hand, Comrade Stalin... You have to run away from here. Kolivanov won't let up, he'll hand you over to Fishman. Do you understand, little Kraut? Come over here. - Take this! - Where did you get that? - Don't speak. - Why? Don't speak to anyone. Pretend that you're dumb, they won't harm a cripple. - Here, take this. - This is my dress! I'm telling you not to say a word to anyone. This is my dress. Where did you get it? Don't speak! Do you understand? Let me put it on... Didn't understand a fucking word, did you. Gnasha! Look at me! Concussed! You leaving? I like it here. Take the pot with you. Are you in love with her? You're the one who fell in love with a German. Potsdam, Germany, April 1945. Don't be scared! Don't be scared! We'll go as far as Irkutsk and get passports. I have a contact there. You know what, Stepan? I can't have children. When I was 16, we were building a pigsty for the orphanage. It was winter, freezing, I got a chill, they had to operate. And then the pigs never even arrived. What about Pashka? Pashka? Pashka's... a trophy! Is Pashka ok? I think he's ok. He didn't even wake up. You ok? Fine. Just hit my shoulder. - Is it alive? - No. We killed it. Must have seen the lights. Look at the amount of holes in its head. It really was immortal. Not anymore it's not! It'll feed the village for a week. No way! Vovka said we should leave it alone, or terrible things will happen. Why do you want to leave? Why? They'll arrest you and send you to a camp, and take Pashka away. And Ignat might still come back. - That German girl is nothing compared to you. - Let me go. What'll I do without you? It's a pity that the bear didn't eat any of you. Borka, give us a hand! You shouldn't eat the bear. He'll get his own back on you. Bad things will happen. Why are you eating it then? - What are you eating it for then? - Tastes good. Give it over here! - It's ready! - Come on! They called it the Immortal Bear. What are you doing? Gustav! I'm writing ''Gustav'' - that's what I'm calling it. Have you gone crazy? What are you doing? You and your ''Gustav''... ...Gustav... ...stupid girl. Let's just paint a Swastika onto it instead. You brought your little queen back. Why did you write ''Gustav'' on the train? Is ''Gustav'' a Nazi? Move back. Fucking driver. Go on, Stepan, crush him... To hell with you and your German girl... push him out of the way... He's destroying our Stepan... Let's go Pashka. We should never have come back here. Hit him. Hit him. Get back. Get away from the train! Get back, you bastards! Bit the little Fascist bitch! Watch out! Elsa, I'll help you! Leave him alone! Let me go! The Wash house's on fire!! Why did I choose an idiot? Borka, stop! Stop, Borka! I said Stop! You little fucker! - I didn't have time. - Didn't have time for what? A long time ago, I dreamed about you... ...while I was still living in ''Gustav'' in the woods. You had fair hair and blue eyes, ...but it was you for sure, I know that now. And you smiled... just like that soldier in the poster. ...my beloved. It's beating. It's beating. Gnasha... Gnasha... Give the engine driver back his medals. How did you know about that? I know about everything. Why didn't you tell me about the German girl? She was right under your nose for four whole years. I wanted to kill her myself. But she's a slippery one, and the engine driver was protecting her. I was sure she drowned. Pour! She did drown... So why didn't you tell me about the German child? What German child? What a fucking welcome! Kolivanov! What a fucking welcome you give, you scum. What next? Drunk the Motherland dry, or only got as far as the Urals? Not only do you destroy our trains, but you breed more Germans. Saboteurs. And yet nobody punishes you. Comrade Stalin pities you, hiding you here from the justifiable anger of the people. So that the people won't tear you wretches limb from limb. That anger is borderless, and eternal! He's kind, Comrade Stalin. His heart bleeds for everyone, ...even for you, enemies of the people! But me, I'm not so kind! For you the only thing you fear is - Fishman! Fishman will come. And if he doesn't... Where will you all go? Got a taste of freedom! Maybe some of you think you're here by mistake. If you don't like it here, we have a real camp nearby. Who'd like a real camp, then? Two steps forward! Stand in line! Stand in line! Keep the line! Where's the German girl's admirer? He's clearing snow off the switching points. Kolivanov, break up the crowd! Into the barracks, you heard me! Pick on somebody else's children. Now open up the wagon! You've really lost control over them. Let's break it up here! Give me an axe! Get away from the wagon! Pashka, don't be afraid my little one! Where are you going? Halt! - Get back! - Pashka! - What are you doing! What are you shooting for, you rat? So you want to get into the wagon then? Pashka! Pashka, I'm right here, my son! Leave that lock alone! What are you doing, bitch? Pashka! So? Who else wants to stand up for the little Fascist? You killed her! Sofia!... It hurts... Pashka... Stupid woman! Stupid woman! Move out, Sarkisyan! Why did you kill her? She was a German loving whore. Where are you going? You can move out without my help. I'll manage on my own. Hang on! Hang on!... the medic's on his way. That's the first time anyone's ever carried me. Hang on! Take it easy. It won't be long... Give Pashka back, bastard! Hey, concussed, go on, catch him! Come on, faster! Fishman! Fishman! Fishman! Fishman! Fishman! Who do you think is fucking 'Fishman', me? This is 'Fishman'! ''F-SH-M'' You and I fought on the Front-line! We're war heroes. We both should know that Germans stick with Germans! Why did you call it ''Gustav''? After a relative! Even if you've painted it red, your ''Gustav'' will never make 50! It's no match for ''Fishman''! There's no match. I know everything about these engines! My old man raced trains for 40 years. You'd better get as far away from here as possible! There's nowhere else to go. My berries, my poor little berries! You've really annoyed me now, Sergeant! You won't live long enough to see a court-martial! Come out of there, you bastard! See that? You said it wouldn't make 50. That's a record. Like fucking that! Brake! This man liberated all of you wretches. He fought the entire war, right up to the fall of Berlin. He was wounded twice, his guts are full of shrapnel... What are you shouting for? Who are you? Me? I'm Kolivanov. He's coming round. Dizzy? Losing consciousness? Ever been concussed? Yes. Well, you can add this one to the list. What happened here? What do you remember? Kolivanov, I have to leave. My daughter Nastya's sick. I have to leave! What a fucking welcome! Pedal as fast as you can! Look, he can't wait to see his daughter. She died. She was buried in 1943. She was just a little girl. Pedal as fast as you can! You're in the lead! We ran all around Siberia for over a year. In Taishet, we finally found someone who helped us get some documents. Ignat got a job at a train depot as a mechanic. We had three children: a boy and two girls. Pashka now sings in the choir. But I can only sing with him at home. I never sing or speak in public. Ignat told everyone that I'm dumb. No one from around here would ever harm a cripple. My love, please take me along with you Far away where I can be a stranger for you My love, I would take you along But I don't need a stranger far away. My love, please take me along with you Far away where I can be a wife for you Far away where I can be a wife for you
