You know, Marthy, I told you|I don't see my Anna... ...since she was little girl|in Sweden, 5 year old. How old will she be now? Oh, she must be... She must be|20 year old, by Jove. - You've not seen her for 15 years?|- No. I think it's better Anna live on farm. Then she don't never know that... That old devil sea. She don't know father like me.

Oh, what's up with you?|Ain't you a sailor yourself? Yes, and that's just why I say it. Sailor is all right fella,|but not for marry girl. I know that.|Anna's mother, she know that too.

Wanna kick me out, huh? Well, see here, Chris. There|ain't no Swede on no boat... ...that's man enough|to get away with that. Don't you start nothing you can't finish. No, I don't start nothing, Marthy. No, you don't. You... You're a scream. Oh, honestly... You're a knockout. I don't see nothing for laugh at. You don't? Go and take a slant|at yourself in the mirror. Oh, gee. Old squarehead, huh? Trying to kid Marthy Owens, huh? Oh, I'm onto the game. I wasn't born and dragged up|on no waterfront for nothing.

I do that, Marthy.|I been coming right back. Oh, well, that's that. Give me a whiskey.|Ginger ale on the side. And don't be stingy, baby. - Well, shall I serve it in a pail?|- Well, that suits me down to the ground. Gee, I needed that bad, all right, all right. Oh, sure. You look all in.|Have you been on a bat? No. Traveling. Day and a half on a train. Had to sit up all night|in a dirty coach too. I thought I'd never get here. - Where'd you come from?|- St. Paul, out in Minnesota. Minnesota? Then you're the...? All the way from Minnesota, sure. Say, what are you laughing at? Me? Oh, no. Sure, kid. No, l...|I was thinking of something else. Well, I wouldn't blame you, at that. I guess I do look rotten. I'm just out of the hospital two weeks. I'm gonna have another drink. What do you say?|Will you have something on me? Sure thing. Thanks. Larry? Larry! Little service here, please. - Same for me.|- Oh, same here. Sit over here. Let's be friends, yeah? I'm a dead stranger|in this burg, you know. - Skoal. Here's how, huh?|- Here's luck. Let you smoke in here, won't they? Sure, but throw it away|if you hear someone coming. Well, ain't they fussy in this dump. Is there anything wrong with me? You're sure looking hard enough. I ain't gotta look very hard.|I got your number... ...the minute you come in the room. Is that so? Well, I got yours too, without no trouble. You're me, 40 years from now.|That's you. Is that so? Well, I wanna|tell you straight, kiddo... ...that Marthy Owens never... Oh, let's cut out the scrapping. I don't want no hard feelings|with no one. - Come on, let's shake and be friends.|- Sure. I ain't looking for trouble either. Let's have another, huh? Say, don't you think you'd better|go kind of easy on that stuff? Well, I guess you're right. I gotta meet someone too. My old man. I ain't seen him since I was a kid.|Don't even know what he looks like. I just got a letter now and then. This was always the only address|he gave me to write him back. He used to be a sailor. He's a janitor|of some building here. - A janitor?|- Sure. And I was thinking, seeing he ain't|done a thing for me in my life... ...he might be willing to stake me with|a room and eats until I could rest up. But I ain't expecting much from him. Give you a kick when you're down,|that's what all men do. And I don't suppose he'll turn out|no better than the rest. Do you hang around this dump much? Oh, off and on. Why, maybe you know him, my old man. Well, it... It isn't old Chris, is it? - Who, old Chris?|- Yeah, Chris Christopherson. - That's his full name.|- That's him. Anna Christopherson is my real name... ...only out there, I call myself|Anna Christie. - So you know him, huh?|- Oh, I've seen him around here for years. What kind is he? Well, he's as fine an old guy|as ever walked on two feet... ...and that goes. Well, I'm glad to hear that. Why, you think he'll stake me|to the rest cure I'm after, then? Surest thing you know. Where'd you|get the idea that he was a janitor? Well, he wrote me he was himself. He's lying. He's a captain on a barge. A barge? What kind of a barge? Well, coal, mostly. A coal barge? Well, well. If that ain't a swell job... ...to find your long-lost old man|working at. Oh, gee. Well, that puts the kibosh|on his giving me a rest. Why? Couldn't you live on it too? Who, me? On a dirty coal barge? Well, what do you think I am? Well, what do you know about a barge? Bet you ain't never seen a barge. That's what comes of him bringing|you up inland where you'd be safe. Say, his bringing me up,|is that what he tells people? Well, I sure like his nerve. Why, he let them cousins keep me on the|farm and work me to death like a dog. Well, you didn't fall|for that farm life, did you? I should say not.|I had to slave for all of them. Was all right till my mother died... ...but I was only a poor relation,|you know... ...and they treated me worse|than they dared treat a hired girl. Oh, what a life on that farm|out in Minnesota. With them Swedes, woman-hungry. One night I was alone in the house|and one of the sons came back. After that, I hated them,|so I'd kill them all if I stayed... ...so I ran away. St. Paul. Yeah, I overheard Chris saying as how|you was in St. Paul. - Working, he said.|- Oh, that's no lie. I went there to work, but I was still a kid. It's all men's fault,|giving you the wrong start. I'm just out of the hospital two weeks. The judge gave all of us girls 30 days. Well, the others didn't seem to mind|being in the cooler much. But I couldn't stand it. I went nuts. I never could stand|being caged up nowhere. I got good and sick, and they had|to send me to the hospital. And it was nice there. I was sorry to leave it, honest. If my old man doesn't help me... ...it's men again. Men all the time. Oh, how I hate them,|every mother's son of them. Don't you? Well, there's good ones|and there's bad ones, you know. Now, your old man, old Chris. Oh, he's a good one, honest. Well, he'll have to show me. Wait till he finds out. Well, you know,|he's kind of simple. He's got nutty notions.|You know, he thinks that... He thinks you're working|as a nurse girl in St. Paul. You know, he thinks that... He means all|right, honest. He thinks the world of you. Honest, he does. Quit your kidding. Well, as soon as I get rested up... ...l'll clear out and get back|to the old job in St. Paul. Come board the ship Long time I wait for you - What's up?|- That's him. - Who?|- Your old man. Golly, Larry. That grub, it taste good. - Is Marthy in back?|- Sure, and another tramp with her. That's him, you see.|He's coming in here. Now, brace up. Oh, hello, old Chris. Say, listen, I'm gonna blow down to the|barge and pack my duds and beat it. She's in there. Your Anna. Yeah, she's just come. She's waiting for you. And you treat her right. She's been sick. Well... So long. Well, so long, kid. I gotta beat it. I'll see you later. Anna. Hello, Father. She told me it was you. I just got here a little while ago. Oh, it's... It's good for see you|after all them years, Anna. Well, it's good to see you too. Anna lilla. Anna lilla. Oh, I had an awful trip getting here. I'm all in. Had a hard time finding|this place, too, you know. I've never been in|New York before, and... I'm just out of the hospital two weeks. You, Anna? Oh, by golly. But you feel better now,|though, don't you? You look little tired, that's all. I am... ...tired to death. I need a long rest. That's why I made up my mind|to come and see you. I thought if you had a place where|maybe, if you didn't mind having me... ...I could rest up for a while. Until I felt|able to get back on the job again. Oh, I got nice place for rest, Anna. You rest all you want. You don't never got to be|nurse girl no more. You stay with me, by golly. You're really glad to see me, honest? Oh, Anna, I'm glad more like|everything for see you, I tell you. Don't you talk no more about getting job. You stay with me. I don't see you for long time... ...and I'm getting old. I got no one in world but you... ...and I'm going to tell you|about everything... ...and you tell me all thing|what happen to you. But not here, now. This ain't no good place for young girlies. Only no-good sailor fella come here|for get drunk. You come with me. You need lie down, get a rest. - Where are you going?|- We go onboard. - Onboard your barge, you mean?|- Aye. Well, nix for mine. Do you think that's a good place|for a young girl? Coal barge? Yeah, I think, Anna. You don't know how nice is on barge. Tug come, he tow us out on voyage. You got just water all around. Sunshine, fresh air, plenty good grub for... For make you strong, healthy girl again. You need a rest like that. You work too hard for young girl already. You need vacation, eh? Well, it sounds pretty good,|to hear you tell it. I'd sure like a trip on the water, all right. I'll go down with you and have a look. Maybe I'll take a chance. Seeing America from a coal barge,|that's a good one. We go? Wait a second. What's the rush? - Gee, I'm thirsty.|- Oh, I'm sorry, Anna. What you think you like for drink? Well, I'll take a... Oh, I don't know, really.|What have they got here? I don't think they got much fancy drink|for young girl in this place. Well, say, ginger ale|or sarsaparilla, maybe. Well, make it sarsaparilla. I tell you, Anna, we celebrate,|just this once... ...because we meet after many year. They got some good port wine. Now, that's good for you, I think.|It ain't strong, neither. One glass, he don't go to your head,|I promise. - All right. I'll take port.|- I go get it. Well, who's the blond? That's Anna, Larry. - Your daughter, Anna?|- Aye. Don't you think she's pretty girl, Larry? Sure, a peach. You give me drink for take back.|One port wine for Anna. She celebrate with me just this once. Small beer for me, please. Small beer for you?|She's reforming you already. You bet. I can't stand it. I better beat it. I take back, Larry. Why, you look a little tired, Anna... ...but I make you take|good, long rest now. You drink your wine. That put new life in you. Skoal, Anna. You know that Swedish word? Skoal. I guess I know that word,|all right, all right. A bridge, Anna, it's pretty, eh? Gives you the creeps, though.|It's like a great big spiderweb. Oh, you're tired, you sick, Anna. Someday, bridge, he look|awfully pretty to you. I bet your life those big buildings|make you open your eyes. Well, it scares me|to think of being up so high. I bet we look like ants to them. I bet they can't even see us down here. On trip back,|I take you up in Woolworth Building. There you see everything. I've seen too much already. You know, Anna, you was|awful pretty girl. I bet you all men see you|fall in love with you, by Jiminy. You cut that.|You talk just as they all do. No harm your father talk that way, Anna. Oh, fine father you are. Like a stranger. Why didn't you ever|come out west to see me? I'm sorry, Anna,|but after your mother die... ...I want come see you|end of every voyage... ...but when I get money|for coming west, I forget. I get drunk and spend all money. I don't know why, Anna,|but that's the way with most sailor fella. That old devil sea. She make them crazy fools|with her dirty tricks. Is so. Well, it's good you got something|to blame it on. Kind of tough for me, though. I know, Anna, I'm sorry.|But if you stay with me, I make you glad. I make you forgive me|for being no-good father. It sounds okay with me.|I'll try anything once. I'm glad you like it here on barge|with your old father, Anna. Who said I like it? Well, you change a lot in one week. The sea air make you feel good again, eh? Maybe. I don't know. Four bells. What time is that? Six o'clock. Funny, all this sea talk.|I'm getting onto the lingo. Now, there's where you belong,|on a real ship like that... ...sailing all over the world. I do that many year when I was big fool. Oh, rats. Say, was all the men in our family|always sailors? Yes. All men in our family crazy fools. My father and my three brothers|is buried at sea... ...lost on sailboat.|Just like your brothers was drowned. Sailor man is no good, Anna.|They don't never come home. Don't never do nothing|what good men do. And sooner or later, that old devil,|she swallow them up. But she don't gonna got me.|No, by Jiminy, not me. Beefing about the sea again. Well, I'm getting so I kind of like it. Old man? Father. Father! Anna, you was scared I got hurt. Oh, gee, I thought you were|overboard, honest. You been sorry if that old devil,|he got Chris, eh? Why, sure. Ain't you my father? Oh, that's a sure thing.|You like me little, maybe? Can the sentiment, Pa.|I'll fix you a whiskey toddy. I'll pull off your boots first, though. Oh, Anna, you make old fella|want to cry. Nix on the sob stuff now. Heave, hearty! Oh, don't go away, Anna,|don't go away. You was my little girl. My Anna lilla. Anna lilla. Anna. - Anna.|- Yes. Here I am. What do you want? Why you don't come turn in, Anna?|It's late, it's after four bells. I like this fog, honest. It makes me feel as if I was|out of things altogether. Fog. That's one of the worst dirty tricks|of that old devil. Funny. I feel sort of strange tonight. Sort of nutty... ...as if I've been living|a long, long time out here in the fog. I don't know just how to tell you|what I mean. But it's like I've come home|from a long visit someplace... ...and I seem to have forgotten|all that's happened. Like it didn't matter anymore. You must think I'm off my base. Oh, Anna, I want always|make you happy. We fool that old devil. We sell barge. And you and me, we live together|in nice little house inland. Inland? You mean leave the sea? By golly, we have a little house,|just you and me... ...and maybe sometime comes along|a nice land fella. You get married. You have kids. Oh, by Jiminy,|that sure is a pretty picture, Anna. Maybe. I wanna be with you... ...but somehow|I don't wanna leave the sea. She's old devil, Anna.|Don't let her get you. Well, ain't it natural, me loving the sea?|It's in the blood, ain't it? I think I'm a big fool for bring you|on this voyage, Anna. Now you're talking nutty yourself. You act as if you were scared|something was gonna happen. - Only God know that, Anna.|- Well, then, it'll be God's will... ...like the preachers say,|what does happen. No. That old devil, she ain't God. Ahoy! Ahoy! Ahoy! - What's that?|- Oh, that scare me for a minute. Is just some fisherman|lose his course in fog. Sound come from this side. They come in from open sea. Ahoy! What's trouble? Heave a rope when we come alongside. - Where are you, you scut?|- This way! Right you are. Why don't he stay where he belongs. Johnson, come and give a hand. Anna, you go in cabin,|get whiskey, please. Those fellas will need a drink|for fix them up. Johnson, come here.|Give me a hand here with this fella. - What is it, sir?|- They come in from the open sea. - Must be sailor fellas.|- The open sea? That old devil is doing|something again, Johnson. Three of them there. - Did you see them there, Johnson?|- Sure, a couple of them is out. Make fast rope there, you fella. Right you are. Heave away. Come in here. - Johnson.|- Johnson, you get that other fella there. Right away. Anna, get whiskey, quick. These here sailor fellas... ...their steamer got wrecked in storm.|Been five days in open sea. Johnson brings another fella.|You take whiskey to him. Take your whiskey, here. Are these all? I'll get whiskey inside. Take that to|the man's who's coming onboard now. What's this tub? Well, we're safe anyhow,|with the help of God. Sure, it's me, Matt Burke himself,|dreaming again. You drink this|and you'll find it's no dream. The devil with the drink. But I'll be taking it anyhow. Sure, I'm needing that.|It's fine stuff. But it wasn't the drink I meant|when I said, was I dreaming. Sure, I thought you was some mermaid|out of the sea, come to torment me. Aye, real flesh and blood, devil the less. Cut that. What's a fine, handsome woman|the like of yourself doing on this scow? Never you mind. You're a great one, honest. Starting right|in kidding after what you've been through. I'm telling you, but for the strength|and guts in me, we'd be scoffed... ...by the fishes this minute. Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? But you must come and lie down|and go to sleep. Lie down and sleep, is it? But you'll not be thinking|I'm a weak scut. Sure, I could lick any man on this boat|with one hand tied behind me back. I could lick all hands on this tub|one by one, tired as I am. Ain't you the hard guy, though, huh? But never mind that fight talk.|I'll take your word for what you say. You're all in, own up to it. The devil I am. Well, be stubborn, then, for all I care. And I must say I don't care|for your language. The men I know don't pull rough stuff|when ladies are around. Ladies! Let you not be making|game of me. Whisht, now, milady,|it's one of your kisses I'm needing... ...to take the tiredness from me bones.|One kiss, now. Let go of me, you...! Oh, gee, I was scared for a moment|I'd killed you. Killed you, you say? Faith, it would take more than a bit|of a blow to crack my thick skull. Glory be, you got a power|of strength in them fine arms of yours. Forget it. I'm sorry it happened. Only, you've no right|to be getting fresh with me. Listen, now, don't go getting|any more wrong notions. I'm on this barge because|I'm making a trip with my father. The captain is my father.|Now you know. I'm sorry. I'm thinking I'm not good enough|to kiss the shoe soles... ...of a fine, decent girl|the like of yourself. Will you forgive me now|and let's be friends from this out? I'm thinking I'd rather be friends|with you than anything else in the world. - Sure.|- God bless you. It is a clumsy ape I am. Sure, it is great power I have in me hand|and arm, and I do be forgetting it at times. You're sure strong, all right. Sure, it is the will of God in it... ...that brought me safe|through the storm to the one spot... ...in the world where you was.|Think of that, now, and isn't it queer? Anna, you get in cabin, you hear? Who do you think|you're talking to, a slave? You need to rest, Anna. What are you doing here,|you sailor fella? You ain't sick like others. You get in forecastle, they give you bunk.|You hurry, I tell you. But he's sick. He can hardly stand up.|Look at him. Is it giving me orders you are, me bucko? Let you look out, then. Weak as I am,|I can break you in pieces... ...and throw you over the side,|and your crew after you. I was forgetting, you're her old man.|Sure, I'd not lift a fist to you for the world. Come inside. You can have my bed|if there is no other place. That's your dirty trick, old devil... ...but you don't do that,|no, not that while I live. Mulligan! Sure, it is myself that's hungry. And a pie, Matt. Glory be, what do I care|for a stew or a pie? It's not for food I'm hungry... ...but for the sight of your face.|- Oh, go on with your blarney, you gasbag. Now, Matt, look what you've done.|Pick that up. Shame on you. Sure, her with the face of an angel|and the sting of a wasp. Oh, so it's darning you're doing. Shut up.|You've got a voice like a foghorn. What's this? Well, what do you think it is? Well, holding it up this way, it might be|new underdrawers for old Chris. - Ain't for him, though.|- Oh, ain't it, now? - For some sweetheart?|- Maybe. Don't make me jealous,|or I'll burn it up and him in it. - No. Give it to me.|- You got a guilty look in your eye. Now, you give it to me, now. You bully. Now... Don't! - Look what you've done, galoot.|- When I get ahold of him that wears it... ...l'll pull out an arm and wave you|goodbye with it. Supper's almost ready. Well, I've been hungry. Well, as I was saying to you before... Stand up, just to measure this sweater. Sure, I will. On me head or me feet? Your feet, silly. It is only prayer|or paralysis can save you now, Anna. Well, I'm praying, Matt. It is a miracle|if your prayers are answered. Thanks, Matt. It's for my father. And him|hating to stand up for measurements. - Will you wear it for my sake?|- Oh, yeah. It is a lie in your throat|and you know it. No, it isn't. You made it for me|with your own blessed hands. And I'll wear it when we dock in New|York and take you out for a day's fun. Oh, no, you won't.|It won't be finished by then. I won't go with you.|Make up your mind to that. - Yes, you'll go with me.|- Oh, no, I won't. - Just the two of us.|- Oh, no. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, you will. Well, you won the capital prize, fella.|Help yourself. Anybody else around?|Here we go, boys. Why don't you test your lungs too, Matt. I should test them,|with the fine bellows that I got? Well, try it. Faith, that's a woman's game.|Not for a husky like me. You try it, Anna. No, Matt. You do it. I haven't got|the wind in me that you have. Hand it over. Watch me. Sure, I've air enough|in me chest to blow up a balloon. Well, I don't doubt it. What do you mean, you don't doubt it? I was just kidding. I bet he goes to 40. Oh, boy. Step up and roll the sweet mamas|out of their beds. Make your own sweet mama jealous. Only 25 cents to see the most|enchanting scene on Coney Island. Now there's Lily and Clytie|without any nighties. Hey, you, step right up. Give us a good free look at the mamas|in their pretty lace hootenannies. Wanna keep us|in bed all night, tightwad? Loosen up, lads. Give us a little tumble. I'll bet you couldn't hit that target if you|stayed until you grew a long, white beard. - The devil I couldn't.|- Come on, Matt. Go on and try it.|Bet you can't even hit the net. - Yeah, how about a home run, Babe Ruth?|- Sure, I dare you to. With one throw, I could knock them|dames off of their bunks. Go to it, big boy. Don't overlook me, carrot top. I have the|shape that makes the old men young... ...and the young men old.|- Attaboy. - Mama wants Papa.|- Papa wants Mama. Some mamas too. Now somebody else. Somebody that packs a mean right. What we want this time|is a regular he-man. You shut up or I'll wrap you|around the target. Don't get sore, big boy. It's a hot night.|Roll me out of the blanket. And that be the end to the story|of the whale and the grasshopper. Oh, Matt, honest,|I ain't ever laughed like this. - You're funny.|- Sure, I'd think it was blarney... ...if it wasn't meself|was making you laugh. Oh, sure, Anna, you're crazy about me,|and I'm not after blaming you. You just hate yourself, don't you, Matt? Oyster loaf for the lady, sir. - I ordered milk for the lady.|- Well, I've got it here. Well, let's drink to our good health. Here's to you. And skoal, Matt, to you and me. - Hot mustard, Matt?|- I don't need it. - Pepper?|- Full of it. - Well, here's something you do need.|- Oh, is that so, now? Well, all right. But if I'm needing sugar,|I know where to look for that. Oh, we're goofy, Matt.|Just like a couple of kids. Sure, Anna, when you're in love,|you ain't got the brains of a tick. What do you mean, love? You know what I mean, Anna. It's in me eye and|on the tip of me tongue. A man like me ain't given to loving|a woman. He knows too much about them. Every color of them,|from here to the China Sea. The whole lying, cheating smear of them.|Sailors' bait. When he comes across|a girl like you, Anna... ...that's as clean as a shell. You're a lucky girl to be hearing|such talk from the lips of Matt Burke... ...him that the women are so crazy over. Anna, what's come over you? Oh, nothing. Sure, don't lie to me, Anna.|You're as stiff as a corpse. Hello, dearie. - Well, I'll be...|- Well, she's a friend of mine. Aren't you, dearie? I'm afraid I don't remember you. - She don't remember me.|- Of course she don't, you old scab. - Beat it, or I'll have you thrown in the brig.|- No, Matt, maybe I do know her. That old sea cow?|Go on, clear out of here. You know a nice young girl|never met the likes of you. A nice young...? A nice young...|Pure and white as a lily. Shut up, or I'll choke the wind|out of your gullet. Oh, Matt, let her alone. She don't mean nothing by it. Anna. Anna, darling. You see what you've done?|You frightened her. - Go on, clear out of here.|- I'm going, I'm going. Let her alone. Don't go. I was lying, Matt. I know her and she knows me. I recognized her the minute|she stepped across the room. Shut up, kid. You don't have to|spill over for nobody. You ain't responsible|for what your old man does. I'll tell you why|she didn't want to talk to me. Because I'm a tramp, that's why. And her old man kicked me off the barge|when she come there to live on it. Yeah, he didn't want any old wharf rat|around a nice young girl. Well, it ain't so, though, Matt.|She's lying. Lying, I'm ly...? Well, I like your nerve,|all right, all right. Gee, I'm sorry I came here|to speak to you. Insulting me. Well, can you beat it? I'll be toddling along. I'm glad you found yourself|such a nice, friendly gent. I hope you're happy, kid. I'm sorry I bothered you, honest, l...|Oh, forget it, Ann. You only got one life to live. And it's a... of a life at that. Say, skipper, you wouldn't stake me|to a quarter, would you? You know, I haven't had|a drink in a month. Take it and beat it. With pleasure, captain. Well, so long. Be a good girl, Ann,|no matter how lonesome. Happy days. Happy days. The poor old devil. Sometimes I feel sorry for them. Come on, Anna. Don't let it get you down.|Sure, the world's full of them. I know it's a sad sight for a decent|young girl the like of yourself, darling. What would you say, Matt,|if I told you that? Say what, me darling? Tell me what. Oh, nothing. Sure, I know what you'll be wanting|to tell me soon, if not this minute... ...that you love me. Don't be so sure of yourself, Matt.|I'm loving nobody. And you'll be wanting to marry me,|and maybe I'll be accepting you. Why, Matt. You want to marry me? - Honest?|- Sure, I'll marry you. Only, don't be putting me to too many|tests, or I might change me mind. I'm tired, Matt. I wanna go back to the barge. You... You think you love|that sailor fella, Anna? Well, what if I do? You think maybe you marry him? No. I'm glad you don't marry sailor, Anna.|Is bad for woman. They don't never see their men|only once in long while. You sit and wait all alone... ...and when their boys|grow up and go on sea... ...they sit and wait some more. Any girl marry sailor is crazy fool,|I tell you. Your mother, she tell you same thing|if she was alive. Well, that ain't why I won't marry him. I'm not thinking about myself... ...but about him. He's such a simple guy, a big kid. And I haven't got the heart to fool him. You fool him? Oh, you go crazy, I think. I've been thinking I was myself|the last few days. I'll be outside. I love to watch the ships passing. When Matt comes along,|tell him where I am, will you? All right, I tell him. Well, God bless who's here. How's the world treating you|this afternoon, Anna's father? Oh, pretty good, if it ain't for some fellas. Meaning me, do you? Well, if you ain't|the funny old crank of a man. Where's herself? - Where's Anna, I'm after asking you.|- She gone out to look on boat. Well, I'll be going out to her. But before I go, I'll take|this chance while we're alone... ...to have a word with you.|And that word is soon done. I'm marrying your Anna|before this day is out. You may as well make up|your mind to it, like it or no. That's easy for saying. You mean I won't? Is it yourself|is after stopping me, do you think? - I stop it if it come to worst.|- Sure, it isn't trouble I'm looking for. You're her father. Wouldn't it be a shame|for us to be at each others' throats... ...like a pair of dogs,|and I married to Anna. So out with the truth, man alive.|What is it you're holding against me at all? I don't want my Anna for got married. Listen, you fella. I'm old man. I don't see my Anna for 15 year.|She's all I got in the world. You think now when she come on first trip,|I want her for leave me alone again? Sure, let you not be thinking I've no heart|at all for the way you'd be feeling. Then you do right thing, eh? You ship away again|and leave my Anna alone. Say, big fella like you on sea,|he don't need a wife. He got new girl in every port,|you know that. Oh, shut up. Sure, there's a time come to every man,|on sea or land... ...when he's sick of the lot of them cows,|and wearing his heart out to meet up... ...with some fine, decent girl... ...and building a home to call his own,|rearing up children in it. Sure, Anna's the one woman|in the world for me... ...and I can't live without her now,|I'm thinking. You think I'm going let her life|be made sorry by you... ...just like her mother's was made by me? No, she don't marry you.|Not if I have to kill you first. Glory be to God, what talk|from a stumpy runt of a man. It is queer fool's blather you have, about|the sea done this and the sea done that. You ought to be ashamed to be saying|the like, you an old sailor. I'm hearing a lot from you,|and a lot more that Anna tells me... ...you do be saying to her. I'm thinking|it is a poor weak thing you are. Not a man at all. You see if I'm man|maybe quicker than you think. You know the truth in your heart. The sea|hit you a clout once and knocked you down. You're not man enough to get up for|another, but you lie there howling murder. I'd like to see you|in the best of your youth. - Do what I done in the storm and after.|- Why, you young fool, you. In old days,|when I was on windjammer... ...I went through hundred storms|worse than that. Ships were ships then,|and men what sailing them real men. What you got on steamers now? You got fellas on deck don't know|a ship from a mud scow... ...and below deck, you got fellas|just know how to shovel coal. You might as well|work on coal wagon ashore, you. Is it throwing insults at the men|in the stokehold you are, you old ape? One of them is worth any 10 squareheads|ever shipped on a windbag. - You Irish swine.|- So you don't like the Irish, you old baboon? Sure, it's that you're needing|in your family. An Irishman. A man of the stokehold|to put guts in it... ...so you'll not be rearing up grandchildren|to be jackasses like yourself. Sure, old men getting childish|shouldn't play with knives. Faith, I've half a mind to hit you a clout|will put sense in your square head. Keep away from me, now. Hello, Matt. Are you here already? Say, what's up? How did that chair|get knocked over? Oh, Matt, you haven't been fighting|with him, after you promised? I've not laid a hand on him, Anna. I told him to his teeth I love you.|That's God's truth, and well you know it. He tell same thing|to girl in every port he goes. I know it's true, Matt.|Don't you mind what he says. God bless you. And then I said I thought maybe|you'd have a bit of love for me too. So you told him that? Maybe I have. I've been wondering|if I do love you. I didn't want to, I must own up to that. But l... I guess I can't help it,|so I guess I do. Oh, sure, I do, Matt. What's the use|of kidding myself different? - Sure, I love you.|- God be praised. And I haven't ever loved a man|in my life before, never. Faith, we'll be having a grand, beautiful|life together to the end of our days. Matt. - Goodbye, Matt.|- Goodbye, is it? I'll be coming at you in a second|for more of the same. Own up like a man|when you're beat fair and square. Here's me hand to you.|We'll be friends from this out. No, I don't shake hands with you, fella.|Not while I live. The back of me hand to you,|then, if that suits you. It's a rotten bad loser you are,|devil mend you. No, I don't lose.|Anna said she like you little bit. But you don't hear her say|she marry you, I bet. No, and I don't hear her say|the sun is shining, either. - No, I didn't say it, Matt.|- There, you hear? You're waiting to be asked, you mean? Well, I'm asking you now. We'll be wedded this day,|with the help of God. - You heard what I said after I kissed you.|- I don't remember. I said goodbye.|That kiss was for goodbye, Matt. What do you mean? I can't marry you.|We've said goodbye, that's all. - I knew that was so.|- Is it making game of me you'd be? It's a queer time to joke with me.|Don't be doing it, for the love of God. You don't think I'd kid you now. I'm not joking, Matt. I mean what I say. You don't. You can't.|It is mad you are, I'm telling you. - No, I'm not.|- What's come over you so sudden? You were saying you love me. I'll say that as often as you want me to.|It's true. But why? What? What is it? Because... ...it's the best way I can figure out, Matt. I've been thinking it over and thinking|it over, day and night, all week. Oh, don't think it isn't hard|on me too, Matt. Well, will you tell me what's preventing|this wedding... ...when the two of us has love? I'm thinking it's listening|to that old fool you are... ...him hating me, filling your ears|full of lies against me. Yes, Anna believe me, not you.|She know her old father don't lie like you. You sit down, do you hear? Why do you come butting in|and making things worse? You're like a devil, you are. Here I was, beginning to like you,|beginning to forget all the things... ...l've held up against you.|- You ain't got nothing for hold against me. Haven't I, though? Well, let me tell you. Matt, I'm surprised at you. - You didn't think anything he'd said...|- Sure, what else would it be? Tell me, and don't keep me waiting. I can't tell you, and I won't. I've got a good reason,|that's all you need to know. I can't marry you,|and that's all there is to it. So for heaven's sake,|let's talk of something else. No, I'll not. - Is it married to someone else you are?|- I should say not. You're like them women|can't make up their minds... ...till they're drove to it.|Well, I'll make up your mind for you. We've had enough talk.|Let's go to the other room... ...and dress in your best.|We're going ashore. - She don't do that.|- Where do you get that stuff? Never mind,|get on with your dressing. - We'll see who'll win in the end, me or you.|- Stay, Anna. She will not. She'll do what I say.|You've had your hold on her long enough. - It's my turn now.|- Your turn? What am I anyway? Never mind what you are.|It's what you're gonna be: Wedded to me.|Come on with your dressing. - Don't do one thing he say!|- She will! - I'm her father.|- She will in spite of you. She's taking my orders|from now on, not yours. Orders is good. Never mind now.|We've no time to be wasting. - Do you hear what I'm telling you?|- No, stay here, Anna! You can go to blazes, both of you. You'd think I was a piece of furniture.|I'll show you. Sit down. Sit down, do you hear?|Let me talk for a minute. You're all wrong, see? I'm gonna tell you two something,|and then I'm gonna beat it. I've been meaning|to turn it loose on you... ...every time you get my goat|with your crazy talk... ...about wanting to keep me safe inland. I wasn't going to tell you,|but you've forced me into it. Oh, what's the use? It's all wrong anyway. You might as well|get cured this way as any other. Don't forget what you said about it not|mattering to you what reason I got... ...as long as I wasn't married already. That's me word, and I'll stick to it. You make me laugh, honest.|Wanna bet you will? You wait and see. You was going on as if|one of you had to own me. But nobody owns me, see,|excepting myself. I'll do what I please. And no man,|I don't give a darn who he is... ...can tell me what to do.|I ain't asking either of you for a living. I'll make it myself, one way or another. I am my own boss. Now, put that|in your pipe and smoke it. - You and your orders.|- I wasn't meaning it that way at all... ...and well you know it. You've no call|to raise this rumpus with me. - It is him, you've a right.|- I'm coming to him. But you, you did mean it that way. You sounded just like all the rest. It is queer, rough talk, that,|for a decent girl the like of yourself. Decent. Who told you I was? I'm talking to you now. I don't want to hear.|You go out your head, I think. Well, living with you is enough|to drive anyone off their nut. Your bunk about the farm being so fine. Didn't I write you, year after year,|how rotten it was... ...and what a dirty slave|them cousins made out of me? What did you care? Nothing. Not even|enough to come out and see me. Your crazy stuff about wanting|to keep me away from the sea... ...don't go down with me. You just didn't want|to be bothered with me. - Oh, that ain't so, Anna.|- But one thing I never wrote you... ...it was one of them cousins|that you think is such nice people... ...that started me wrong. And it was none of my fault.|I hated him and he knew it. But he was big and strong, like you. That's why I ran away from the farm. That's what made me get a job|as a nurse girl in St. Paul. You think that was a nice job|for a girl, too, don't you? With all them nice inland fellas|just looking for a chance to marry me. They weren't looking for marrying. You don't say nothing. Either one of you.|But I know what you're thinking. You're just like all the rest. And who's to blame for it? Me or you? If you'd been a regular father|and had me with you... ...things would've been different.|- Don't talk that way. - I go crazy. I won't listen to you.|- You will listen. You, keeping me safe inland.|I was no nurse girl the last two years. I lied when I wrote you.|I was in a house, that's what. Yes, that kind of a house. The kind that sailors like Matt and you|go to in port... ...and your nice inland men too. And all men. I hate them, I hate them... - Oh, it's a lie, Anna, it's a lie...|- So... ...that's what's in it. I suppose you remember your promise. No other reason was to count with you|as long as I wasn't married already. You want me to get dressed|and go ashore, don't you? Oh, yes, you do. I suppose if I tried to tell you|that I wasn't that no more... ...you'd believe me, wouldn't you? And if I told you that just getting out|on this barge and being on the sea... ...had changed me and made me|feel different about things... ...as if all that I've been through|wasn't me, didn't count... ...it was just like it never happened... ...you'd laugh, wouldn't you? And you'd die laughing,|I'm sure, if I told you... ...that meeting you that funny way|that night in the fog... ...and afterwards, seeing that you were|straight good stuck on me... ...had got me to thinking|for the first time in my life. And I sized you up as different from|the ones on land, as water is from mud. I couldn't marry you|with you believing a lie. And I was ashamed to tell you the truth. And now, give me|a bawling-out and beat it... ...like I can tell you're going to. Will you believe it... ...if I tell you that loving you|has made me clean? It's straight goods, honest. Oh, yes, you will.|You're just like all the rest. The rest, is it? My curse on you. Clean, is it? Oh, don't, Matt. Get out of here.|Let me alone. Get out of here! I'll be going. And I'll be|drinking slews of whiskey... ...so to wash that|black kiss of yours off me lips! And I'd be getting dead, rotten drunk|so I'll not remember you at all! I'll ship away on a boat to the end of the|world, where I'll never see your face again! - Oh, don't go. It's better Anna marry you...|- Let go of me, you old ape! Marry her, is it?|I'd see her dead at me feet first. I'm shipping away out of this,|I'm telling you. My curse on you,|and the curse of all the saints. - I go ashore too.|- Not after him, I tell you. Don't you dare. Oh, I go for get drink. I'm driving you to drink too, huh? You wanna get drunk|so you can forget, like him. Aye. You think I like hear|them things? Oh, Anna. Anna, I think you wasn't that kind of girl. You want me to beat it, don't you? You don't want me here|disgracing you, I suppose. Oh, no, no, Anna. You stay here.|It ain't your fault, I know that. It's that old devil do this to me. It was all right on barge,|with just you and me. Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog. That fella, he don't|never come, you don't... ...never tell me them things. I don't never know. Then everything is all right. Oh, that dirty devil sea. Oh, what's the use? Go ashore and get drunk. You wait here, Anna? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I'll get drunk too. Maybe I'll... 0h, what do you care what I do?|Go on and beat it. It's foggy outside. Oh, God. - What's the trouble? Feeling sick?|- Inside my head feels sick. Oh, Anna, you think maybe sometime|you forgive me, Anna? - I'll forgive you right now.|- Oh, Anna lilla. Oh, don't bawl about it.|There ain't nothing to forgive anyway. It ain't your fault, it ain't mine.|It ain't his, neither. I fix everything all right|for you and me, Anna. Yes? Then you and me will stick together? We'll work for each other|and help each other, huh? - What is it you fixed?|- Well, I sign on steamer Londonderry. Sail for Cape Town tomorrow. Oh, Anna, I only bring you bad luck. That's how you fix me, is it? Well, I think that old devil get me back... ...maybe she leave you alone, then. Oh, can't you see that you're doing|the same thing that you've always done? Can't you see that? Oh, what's the use of talking? You ain't right.|I'll never blame you anymore. Oh, Anna. You forgive me, sure? Surely I do. You ain't to blame. You're just what you are, like me. And you, you let me|kiss you once again, eh? - Oh, sure, no hard feelings.|- Oh, Anna lilla. I can't say it, Anna. I think I go lie down, go to sleep. Oh, that booze, he don't go well, Anna. I think I'm never going to drink again. I can't stand this much longer. What am I waiting for, anyhow,|like a darn fool? Anna? - Anna?|- Yes, what do you want? Don't say it. I know what's in your mind. Yes, that's what I was,|and that's what I'm going back to. I'd kill you first. And finish it up. It's a dog's life I been living|since I found out what you are. Oh, why don't you leave me alone.|Go away. Don't you see I'm licked? What do you|want to keep kicking me for? Don't you deserve the worst I'd say,|God forgive you? All right, maybe I do. But don't rub it in. Why haven't you done|what you said you were going to? Ship away to the other side of the earth,|where you don't have to see me. - I have.|- What? You're going away, honest? I signed on, drunk as I was,|and she's sailing tomorrow. - Where is she going? Far away?|- Cape Town. It is at the end of Africa. That's far for you. - What's the boat's name?|- The Londonderry. The Londonderry? Oh, this is too much. Faith, I don't blame you|for laughing at me. True, it is the fool of the world I am|to come back to talk to you at all. Oh, what's the use? What's the use of|me talking? What's the use of anything? Anna... Anna, if I could only be believing|I was the only man in the world... ...ever you had love for,|I could be forgetting the rest, maybe. Are you trying to accuse me|of being in love... ...really in love, with them? You fool, you.|I've stood enough from you. Love them, is it? I hated them, I tell you. And may God strike me dead,|and my mother too, if she was alive... ...if I'm not telling you the honest truth. Oh, sure, Anna, if I could only|be believing you, now. Why, Matt, you've got to believe it. What can I do? What will I do|to prove to you I'm not lying? Anna, would you...? Would you be willing|to swear an oath, a terrible, fearful oath? Oh, sure, I will, Matt, on anything. Would you swear on this? Oh, sure. Give it to me. It is a cross given to me by me mother,|God rest her soul. And I'm telling you,|it has great power in it. And I'm warning you now,|if you swear on this... ...it is me old woman herself who'd|be looking down on you from heaven... ...and praying the saints to put a curse|on you if she hears you swear a lie. I wouldn't have the nerve,|honest, Matt, if it was a lie. But it's the truth,|and I ain't scared to swear it. Give it to me. What do you|want me to swear? You say it. Swear I'm the only man in the world|ever you felt love for. I swear it. I swear it by God. And may the blackest curse of God|strike you if you're lying. And may the blackest curse of God|strike me if I'm lying. Oh, glory be to God,|I'm after believing you now. - Now what's the matter?|- Is it Catholic you are? - No, why?|- Oh, God pity me. Sure, it's some devil's treachery in it. You swearing on a Catholic cross,|and you one of the others. - Well, don't you believe me, Matt?|- Oh, but if it ain't a Catholic you are... I ain't nothing, Matt.|What's the difference? Didn't you hear me swear? I'm afraid I love you, God forgive me,|no matter what you are. I'd be going mad if I'd not be having you. I'd be killing the world.|We'll be wedded this day. And we'll be happy, the two of us,|in spite of the devil. Well, we gotta have a drink on this,|my good man. - Blast you.|- That's the way to talk. Oh, Matt, it's time for you two|to kiss and make up. You'll be shipmates|on the Londonderry, you know. - Shipmates? Has himself...?|- Aye, and I'm boatswain on her. The devil! You'd be shipping away to sea|and leaving her alone again, will you? It's all right, Matt. That's where|he belongs, and I want him to go. You've gotta go too.|We'll need the money. And as for me being alone, why,|that runs in the family... ...and I'll get used to it. I'll get a house somewhere and I'll make|a regular place for you two to come back. And now you'll drink|and be friends, huh? Sure. - Here's luck to you.|- Skoal. Well, you'll not be lonesome long.|I'll see to that, God willing. Sure as himself will be having|a grandchild riding his foot, I tell you. - Maybe twins.|- Oh, quit your kidding. Is it any religion at all you have,|you and your Anna? Well, in the old country,|we was Lutherans. Lutherans, is it? Oh, then I'm damned entirely. Oh, well, what's the difference? It is God's will anyhow. It's queer, you and me|shipping on same boat that way. That ain't right. It's that funny way old devil sea|do her worst dirty tricks. Aye, is so. Faith, I'm afraid you've the right of it|for once, devil take you. Why, gee, Matt, you ain't|agreeing with him, are you? Come on. Here's to the sea,|no matter what. Be a game sport, man. Drink to that. Fog, fog all time. You can't tell where you was going. Only that old devil sea. She knows.
