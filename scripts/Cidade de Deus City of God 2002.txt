Do you think that I am in the mood|to see the fucking gang? The chicken, bro! The chicken I told you, asshole! Get the chicken! If Ze gets you,|you're dead. He has to find me first. Hey, kid! Get the chicken! - The cops!|- Don't run! Buttheads! Mothefuckers! A photo might|have changed my life... but in the City of God,|if you run you're dead... ...if you stay,|you're dead again. It has always been like that|since I was a kid. IN THE 60's - You are so useless.|- Fetch the ball. Hey, kid! Give me the ball. You are not giving it to me? Fuck you.|What's your name? Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Rocket. Do not give the ball|to the kid, he stinks. This is Hairy. The story of the City of God|starts with him. However, Hairy's story|is connected to the Mortes Trio story. The truck is coming.|Why are you fooling around? TRIO MORTES STORY Trio Mortes|the legends of the City of God! Hairy. Snatcher. And Naive. With them, Kid and|Benny, Hairy's brother. I did not have enough courage|to go with my brother. Come Naive! Let's go! Stop or I'll shoot,|fucking asshole. Get out! Quick, asshole.|Give me the money! Who wants gas? Oh! You wanna die for money|that is not yours? Lots of money here! Damn! The cops! Quickly!|They are everywhere! Then, I thought that|Trio Mortes... was the toughest gang |in Rio. But they were just amateurs. Even my bro, Naive. Give these to dad|but do not tell him it's from me. Hairy, come and see what I've got! We came to the City of God|to find paradise. Lots of people were homeless|due to the floods... and the fire|they set in the ghetto. They are going to bring electricity! The big bosses, however,|didn't like the homeless. Without electricity, without|roads, without buses. The rich people...|They don't give a damn about us It has nothing to do with the|Rio De Janeiro you see in postcards. Do you think I am going to be|a lifeguard when I grow up? I don't know. It is better to be a|lifeguard than a fisherman. I don't want to be a fisherman,|I will stink. - Are you insulting your father?|- No. - What do you want to become? I sure don't want to be a gangster|or a cop. I do not want to get killed. Drop it, Kid. Are you pointing a gun at me? The kid is with me. I am a gangster, too. - Not many bottles in it.|- We rob trucks every day. We have to hit a rich|house to get out of here. No, you have to|follow my plan. Look who's talking! He is so stoned, he|doesn't know what he is talking about! You are both not as|worthy as the kid. What are you thinking, Kid? The gun doesn't make you a robber.|You need ideas. The kid had ideas. Is this the Motel? We get the money and leave.|No killings! - Give it to me.|- Leave me alone! Don't you give this|shit to me! You're acting like a baby. - Here's yours.|- Awesome! Do not be hasty. You're staying here|as look-out. If you see cops,|shoot that window. Why doesn't he stay as the look-out? This was my plan.|He is good for nothing! Ok, you had the idea.|But you're just a kid! Cover us. Your turn is going to come.|Don't be so hasty. Stay here. This is a hold up, bitch. You should be at school|or at work. You do not look like robbers. Shut up, bitch! Ok, Snatcher? Are we going in? - I did not order anything.|- It's on the house! Your money! Take it easy. All I want is your money. Hey, pal!|What is this mess? Are you a church boy? Give it to me! You are old, and ugly. Do you want to fuck her? Police! Let's beat it! Take the car.|I'm gonna bring the kid. - It went wrong. The kid is missing!|- They are shooting, let's go! - You said you could drive.|- I can, cool down. Turn! Watch it! - You asshole!|- I didn't do it on purpose. No-one saw a thing.|Don't say a word, OK? I twisted my leg! - Naive is hit!|- It hurts! Take him to the woods.|I will try to distract the cops. God help us. Get the phone. Shortie. Infamous in the City.|I will talk about him later. It hurts, godammit! Shut up!|You're acting like a sissy. Give me your hand! A whole car runs|into a bar... and no-one saw a thing? As always. No-one sees,|no-one knows a thing. - What's up, Shortie?|- They are hiding in the woods. I think they |are hiding in the woods. They are in the woods. Fillipe, lock the car.|Rantzel, come with me. Pitch black.|How do they see? They stole a fortune|from the motel... - What if we took the money?|- Are you out of your mind? I do not want any trouble.|I just want to eliminate them. Since when is it a crime|to steal from niggers and robbers? I know a snitch in the City. Did you hear the shootings?|If I find one of them, I will shoot him! Maracana!|Open the door! They are after me! The police are after me!|Hide me! Come inside. Shit, the cops are|still down there. - I had a vision, Naive.|- Did you smoke anything? You had a job, right?|How was it? What did they say to you? I worked for my father.|Fathers say bullshit. I'm leaving. I do not want to die.|I am not meant to be a gangster. - The cops are down there.|- I don't care. I am going back to the church. "I am the resurrection|and the life... He that believeth in me,|though he were dead, yet shall he live... And whosoever liveth| and believeth in me... shall never die..." Stop, or I'll shoot! "He that believeth in me,|though he were dead, yet shall he live..." The robbery in the motel|was the most bloodstained in history. The gangsters fortunes|changed paths. He couldn't have|been a gangster. He is a worker. Snatcher was|in God's hands. Hairy was caught|in the Bernice's net. and Naive was|in my father's hands. Why are you doing this?|You will be working with me! Your brother is|going to look after you. If I ever catch you with money| that is not yours, I'll kill you! This goes for you too.|Put on your work clothes! If your brother is a gangster|you are affected as well! Don't worry.|He will get over it. These things are not for you!|You go and study. Aren't you afraid of being killed? You are smart -|you have to go to college. I attend school because|I do not like working. Promise me that you are|never gonna touch this weapon. Quickly. I will sell|lots of fish. Do not laugh! You smiled when father|hit me. What's wrong?|Cat got your tongue? I'm thinking how to tell you. You're gonna fry your brain|if you think so much. My heart chose you.|I am listening to my heart. Are you kidding? Have you never head|of love at first sight? - Gangsters do not love.|- You always talk to me in a bad way. - Gangsters seduce.|- I am not going to lose my peace. Gangsters do not stop -|just take a break. - You know nothing of love.|- This is no love; it is a joke. I love you. You might convince me|in the end. After the robbery, police|did raids in the ghetto. Everyday, someone was sent to jail,|someone was sold out. But no-one ever knew anything. No-one revealed the|robber's hideout. THREE MONTHS LATER Why don't you change|your life, Hairy? Find a job instead of|lying in bed all day! Do you think that a job will|give you money? Go try! What do you think |I am doing all day long? Take it easy, baby.|All I want is you. to have children, a farm|with chicken, and lots of weed. I don't believe a word. I almost got rich|with that robbery. The police are after you|after the motel killings. What are you saying? Did you see anything?|So shut up! They shot them,|and blamed it on me! They even killed Kid!|So leave it! - I don't know who did it|- Not me. I don't want a gangster as|the father of my children! You are alone, Hairy! Snatcher became religious,|Naive found a job. - And you?|- I am the same! - Everybody dumped me.|- Then I will dump you too. I am leaving. If you want, come with|me, else I will leave alone! Nice fresh fish! My brother promised|to conform. But the gangster does not change.|Just stops for a while. Naive was having an affair|with Shortie's wife. I have trout, but for you|I have something special. It's a mullet. - Does your husband lick you?|- No. Mine licks me for half an|hour before fucking... ...from behind.|Do you let him? Doesn't it hurt? In the beginning, yes. After that it|is perfect! But you need a banana. - Why?|- You're losing the best part, kid! You warm up a banana|and stick it in your pussy! while he fucks you in the ass.|It is awesome! - Ask your husband.|- I can't. He will get mad Try. Men go nuts|for stuff like that. Fucking nigger! Bitch! Whore! Rocket, give me your|shorts, quickly! - I am not gonna get naked in the street.|- Your brother is in danger! Give me the shirt! Quickly! I always have to pay the price. He ran away.|That's his brother. I will cut his balls! Fish! Fresh fish! Kid, come here. - Where is your brother?|- Not working today. - Get in.|- I did nothing. - What about my fish?|- Get in. Forget the fish. My father will kill me. Let's go. There is nothing here. My father swore not|to see my brother again. No-one saw him again|in the ghetto. The Trio Mortes story|reached its end. Kid! I though you were killed|in the motel. - I can see you got money.|- It's ours, Benny. Cut the crap|and bring the money. Tell Hairy that|Shortie is getting difficult. I'm leaving. But Shortie was getting busy. A neighbour called the cops|before sunrise. The newspapers wrote: "A husband buries his wife|alive in the City of God" The place was full of cops.|The robbers ran away. Do you want to die? Do as I tell you... And show some respect to the lady. - Let's go.|- There are cops ahead. Fuck them. Go!|Go wherever you want. What's the matter? Mercy. It is a piece of crap. - Start the engine!|- It needs pushing. Push, Hairy.|Push! You? Do you want to arrest|the thieves? There's one... Get him! Run, Hairy!|Stop! He's a murderer! The day that Hairy|was killed... I remember the crowd|and a camera. I always wanted a camera. Let's go to school. - Why don't we go to the beach?|- We have exams! So what!|Everybody is on the beach! She wears a bikini|and plays hard to get! Sun is for everyone.|Beach for a few. IN THE 70's When I was 16 I bought|my first camera. Starting from the bottom.|The cheapest model! How is it going, Rocket?|Have you been laid yet? Nothing. Oh, Angelica. She drove me mad... Rocket, are you jerking? Gorgeous and had got laid.|I wanted to lose my virginity with her! - She has a boyfriend.|- So? I am not jealous - Her father is a cop.|- No-one is perfect. I was the official photographer|of the gang. of the "Groove Gang". Everybody paid for copies. Siago, move backwards.|There. I need a joint. Snort coke.|It's great! Siago, do you snort?|I prefer a good pot. - I can find it for you if you want.|- Go find it, then. If we talk about dope|we talk about coke! Drugs! - You're full of salt.|- Fuck off. You want to be a lifeguard|but you never go in. I bet a beer I|am a better swimmer. If you want I can find a joint|at Blackies. I would do anything for her. I would find pot, coke... I would go to the big boys|to buy good stuff... The boss was an ex-|classmate: Blackie. - Who?|- It's Rocket! How are things going?|The kids OK? Do you want to buy|or smoke? Who is it? This was Blackie's hideout|But it hadn't always been. Fuck off, kid|Why are you marching in like that? Is this your hideout? THE STORY OF THE HIDEOU Donan Zel started to sell drugs|after becoming a widow... to feed her children. She often gave out dope|to the kids in exchange for special favours... Her favourite was|Big Guy. She was such an amateur|that even Big Guy was cheating on her. Big Guy was using kids|as dealers. - My pot?|- Stick it in your ass. The best dealer... was Redhead. May I have a sip? Big Guy trusted him... and so he became a manager. Twenty for us,|five for you, Blackie. One day a friend of Redhead appeared. Aristotle. My wife was sick. His family had helped|Redhead. He would not refuse help|to a brother. The dope. I want the money|by Friday. You got me out of jail. He is a friend, Big Guy. Give him another week. You either kill him or I'll kill you. He had no choice. - I told you on Friday.|- Don't do it, friend! Redhead wanted to get|the Big Guy... but he did not have to.|Big Guy died in jail. Redhead took| Big Guy's belongings... but not the hideout.|It was cursed. He gave it to his trustee,|Blackie. - Hundred and fifty bags.|- Not enough. So he took over|the local dealing. But not for long. Who is it? Go see. Fuck off, kid. Why are|you rushing into my hideout? Who told you|it is yours? And I am not 'kid'.|My name is Ze. THE STORY OF LITTLE ZE Ze had wanted to rule|the City of God... since he was a kid. They are having fun and I am not? I want to go home! What do you want? |Your friend took it all. That night, Kid|satisfied his thirst for blood. knowing that Hairy|would never forgive him. To save himself|he left the City of God. He worked all day for nickels. Kid and Benny|really made it... they had the gift of the killer. - You have more.|- I had the idea. The problem was to handle|an older gangster. like my brother Naive. Dammit! I though you died in the motel.|You have lots of money! It is our money, Benny. Benny, tell Hairy that|Shortie is getting difficult. I'm leaving the ghetto. From Hairy.|You are gonna need it. Robbery after robbery|the Kid grew big. When he was 18 he was the| most respected gangster in the City. One of the most| dangerous robbers in Rio. Happy birthday, Kid.|Glad you turned 18. Beat it! - Just a beer!|- Didn't you see me, asshole? Next time I will kill you,|you prick! Kid was ready for anything! And couldn't wait. Who's the wealthiest here? Lots.|Jerry Andriani... golden necklace, luxurious clothes. - Perriera and the chick.|- My brother took her. Look at the race. Here is Blackie.|Full of gold. Redhead. Nice wheels!|All of the dealers. - All of them wealthy.|- Robberies are shit... the big money is in drug dealing. - Especially coke.|- Needs capital, though. We will kill them|and take over. - When do we start?|- Now! The light of Satan|brought you here! Why do you live in the City of God|that God has forgotten? I know what you want.|You want power. I have something that will give|you the power you're looking for... that will change your fate.|I give you my amulet. Just do not fuck|while you wear it... because you will die! The kid will no longer be Kid|but Ze. Little Ze grew up. If you help me|I will help you. In this way Kid became Ze|and started the killings. One morning,|he took over Andriani's gang... By nighttime, he ruled|all the ghetto gangs. He did not harm Redhead|since he was Bennie's friend. Only the hideout was left.|but it was an easy job. Who is it? Fuck off, Kid. Why are you|barging into my hideout? Since when is it your hideout? Anything wrong Kid? I am not Kid.|My name is Ze! - You're dead, bastard!|- No, he understands. It's all yours. I want nothing.|I don't want trouble. I had to take vengeance|for my brother's death. You are gonna live,|but you will work for us. Easy to say. - Where are you going?|- He's clean, Ze. - What is your name?|- Rocket Naive's brother.|Dead Naive's brother. Go and tell everyone|that Ze is now in charge. We are selling coke.|Got it? Drug dealing is a job, too. The supplier brings the merchandise|which is packed. It's a supply chain. Pot is wrapped. coke is packed in 10s or 100s. You can have a career as a drug dealer. The kids start as messengers. Then they do lookouts. If the cops come|they all vanish. Then you become a dealer. In hard times|the dealer vanishes. Growing up,|you become captain. And if you are good at|maths, you become a manager. Boss's right hand. The cops get their cut|and stay out of it. When Ze came,|all the rivalry stopped in the City. You could go there. Bohemian people bought|their dope safely. Lots of people became addicts|and Ze became rich. - Which one should I wear?|- This is cool. If drug dealing were legal|Ze would be given an Oscar. I thought that all these|guys were very dangerous. However he was everywhere. If I needed pot|I had to visit Redhead. - Half a pound.|- Thanks. It was worth it.|I smoked it with Angelica. She had broken up with Siago|and so I made my move. Fantastic photos. Do I look good here? You look good in all of them. Twilight, an empty beach,|a long-lasting kiss... That was it... But the Shorties came... Will you give me a spliff? Here. See you later. - Your joint!|- Keep it! First time I met|the Shorties. Here, Benny. Steak and potatoes. - This is for you.|- All of it? Thanks. Do you want to have something to eat? Can you change the time on the watch, please? After he broke up, Siago|sniffed more and more everyday. When you become an addict, |you're in the dealer's hands. - Two bags of ten.|- One bag. For Siago it was not like that. - Sorry, godfather.|- Bullshit, did I baptise you? Give me your bike,|Blackie. Do you wanna race? To the bus. Ready? Go! - Hard race.|- You're good. - Where did you buy the trainers from?|- From the neighbourhood. - And the shirt?|- From the City. It is an expensive brand. If I give you the money|will you buy me one? Shorts and shirt? Buy whatever you can. - What is your size?|- Measure me! - With what?|- With you! Shoe number?|Turn around. Benny! Did you get the goodies? - Just a pair of trousers?|- There is more. Do you like it? - You have some change.|- Keep it. This is Benny. I became bohemian. Gangsters, listen.|Beware... Grooves are making moves|before the big boom. Fuck you, bastards! Prick! Redhead is placing|the ghetto in danger. Go talk to him. You can't|just shoot everybody. Don't worry,|the lads here are OK I'm not worried! Will you dance, Benny? What|happened to Redhead? Go talk to him! Benny was the coolest|gangster in the City. He gave away dope,|paid for his drinks. Ze was the opposite.|He was obsessed. Wanted to become the big ghetto boss. He was looking for the opportunity|to take over Redhead's gang. Don't let the Shorties|rob the whole ghetto. You mind your business|and I will mind mine. I'm going for a drink. How is it going, Rocket? Siago, what's up? Want to dance? Can we go to your place? My parents are not home.|we're gonna be alone. Today you can|lose your virginity! Don't shout!|Everyone will hear! You're pretty. It's OK. I know you are related to|the Shorties. Do you think I am stupid?|You want my gang? I just want to talk to you.|You are useless! The Shorties|are endangering us. Ask them to cool down. He lets them plunder|in his ghetto, the useless shit. If police come here|we're fucked. I will do it because I like you. Change his nappies! Tell them that no-one|plunders in my ghetto! The Shorties do not respect|the ghetto rules. They steal from ordinary people|and rob bakeries. You're stealing from me all the time! However, they didn't know|the city had a new boss! THANK YOU|FOR PREFERING US The city has become safer|for the inhabitants. Robberies are rare. All you have to do is visit Ze. - Do not touch Shorties|- I won't. - Let's go for a walk|- Together? Mom, I am going out|with my friends. I have never tasted a better chicken! - The old man was scared to death!|- You feel sorry for him? Should we rob a bank|or a supermarket? Bullshit. All the money|is in drug dealing. You have to start as|a messenger. It is no good. Takes too|much time to be promoted. You have to wait for|an old guy to get killed. I won't wait for anyone to| bite the dust. I'll do as Ze. Are you talking about me, kid?|The boss is here. Come back, you tramp! They run fast! Anyone else? You're gonna pay for|the ones who ran away. Shall I shoot you|in the arm or the leg? - Choose.|- Hand or leg? Choose, dammit! - In the hand.|- In the hand, eh? Let's see about you.|Kill one of them. - I'll do it!|- Beat it! He's gonna do it. Pick whom you'll kill. - We don't have all day.|- Kill one of them. Get over with it, Steak. I want to see if you have the guts. Well done! You did it!|You're one of us. Gimme five! Get up, tramp.|Go back to your shithole. Stop limping! Tell your friends|no-one steals from Ze. While Ze was earning the|respect of the locals... Benny was winning|Angelica's heart. I was still a virgin and broke.|I had no other choice... THE LIFE OF A SUCKER I found a job|in a supermarket. I was working for just a few nickels.|I wanted to be fired... to buy a camera|with the compensation. But my fate was different. The guy from the beach!|Do you still smoke? Kid!|Pull your shirt. Is this a thank you? - What about my compensation?|- What compensation? The fucking manager|thought I participated. You are fired|because of duty violation. Beat it! I did not get a dime. A message from God. ''Honesty is|punished, sucker.'' FLIRTING WITH CRIME The bus is late. I should|be at work already. - Hide the gun! Are you mad?|- It's broken. - It is not our fault.|- It is never anyone's fault! But we pay the price. Goodnight, lady. I know him. He lives|in the City. He will recognise us. It is his boss's|money. He doesn't care! Aren't you|from the City of God? Only one shall pay. Study, only this way| you can leave the ghetto. - Do you study?|- I attended school and then I joined the army. I was a good shot.|Then, I found this job. I have knowledge of karate. If I find a job|elsewhere I will leave the ghetto. Do you wrestle? I am peaceful.|But if I have to... And he was going to have to. But I|will talk about Knockout later. We are leaving. Bye. - I couldn't, he was cool.|- He is Gerson's brother. Let's go home. There is only a bakery here. - What are you going to say?|- I don't know! ''Robbery!'' - My phone number?|- Do you prefer soul or groove? Nothing again. The girl|was very sexy. She flirted with me. I couldn't pull the gun,|she was so sweet. I am lost. How do| I get to Bara? "The guy from Sao Paolo|was unlucky", I thought. That's where we are going too. You are saving me. Everybody from|Sao Paolo is a nasty piece of work. We found the body, officer! Not a pretty sight, eh? Awesome singer.|I like music. Do you? You like pot, too? Never tried. I thought so. - Do you have paper?|- I have some. I was a professor in rolling joints. If only I was like that|with girls! I wouldn't still be a virgin. For a guy from Sao Paolo,|you're cool. What did they kill her with? With a bat or a rock. - The kid...|- They didn't hurt it. - How long ago?|- About four hours. Shall we take it? The murderer must|be from the City of God. Motherfucker! You should have killed her in the| ghetto! Cops are coming! It was a matter of honour.|Her parents sent me away. The place is full of cops|because of you! Asshole! You punished him enough, Ze. Whoever kills in my|ghetto, dies. He had issues, Ze. Leave the ghetto.|You showed disrespect! The snake will bite you,|Benny. - He was useless.|- A dirty traitor. I am going for a walk with the girl. Take care. When|things calm down... we will deal with|Redhead again. Get a girlfriend, Ze. - Do you know what I am thinking?|- That I am sexy? That too. Do you know|what we can do? - Make love?|- I am serious. Get out of here.|I hate violence. - And go where?|- To a farm. we are hippies at heart. To a farm? Peace and love? BENNY'S FAREWELL Benny was too cool|to be a gangster. With his party he managed|to bring everyone together. Gangs... Soul fans... Religious people... Some day I'll go to the church. Samba fans... Groovers... And Ze, who danced for|the first time in his life. Wanna dance? - I can't hear you.|- Are you dancing? Thanks, I got company. I want to talk to you. You are not going away|with that chick. I'll live on a farm,|I'll smoke pot, and listen to rock. Are you going to ruin everything|for a bitch? She's my girl. I will kill |Redhead, the bastard. You think that everybody is a bastard|that is why I leave! I am your friend but I am leaving.|Try to understand. I like you but that's all. Show me your balls, man! You wanna die? Beat it! Put your pants down, nigger! I wanna see your ass! Come on, you faggot! Show us your ass! Pull them down! The camera|for a bag of coke? - No more shit.|- You're my friend. - Is it stolen?|- My father's. - Give it to Ze.|- Rocket will probably want it. Here I am! You want to be a photographer?|Here's a present. Awesome! Shake your ass! You're gonna shoot|fine photos. Bring it here. - Give me the camera!|- No. They killed Benny! Call an ambulance! Who the fuck did it? Ze, Benny is dead. It's your fault, bitch! - Where is Redhead?|- Blackie came. I'll fuck her. - Why?|- We're both fucked. I think I killed|Benny. Ze is coming. We can|catch up with him in the disco. - Did you kill Benny?|- Accidentally. I aimed at Ze. Blackie. You killed the coolest|gangster in the City. Without Benny, Redhead|was dead. We're fucked, man. Where else could a miracle happen|if not in the City of God? Hallo, doll.|Gimme a kiss. Let me pass.|Have you ever seen your face? All's well baby? It was simple as that.|Ze was ugly. Knockout Ned|was handsome. Knockout had whoever he wanted.|Ze had to use violence. a duel between the good|and charming... and the bad and ugly. Let go of me! Enjoy it. No need to resist. you are mine now. Your girlfriend|is hot, lucky bastard. I cannot even look at her. Why didn't the motherfucker|kill me? Why didn't I kill|the asshole? - Let's go back.|- And Redhead? - We'll be back.|- Are you going to kill him? Knockout, get out. Take it easy. I am going out. Let go of me. Gerson, come back! Its none of your business, kid.|It's your brother we want! My brother is peaceful! Is he too pretty to talk to me?|Tell him to come out! He did nothing. Do you know who I am?|I'm Ze! Bring the mother fucker! Cool down, I'll bring him. I'm hit. Redhead will be|waiting. He asked for it. The bastard|killed my brother! I won't let it go. Need a gun? - My child!|- Take it easy, Mom. - Do it right.|- There is no other way. - How could he hit me?|- That's a bad hole. We were like brothers. You were hit by one brother,|me by the other! Knockout isn't bad.|He came out of nowhere. You give me a headache, Tuba! The City of God|found its hero. God bless you.|The kid went looking for trouble. You did a fine job.|You have to hide. I though Knockout would start|a revolution here. But God had|other plans. Steak, where did the|dealers disappear? They are hiding.|Ze is not in a good mood. They put us in it|and then hide. - Bring me a chocolate.|- I'll try. Tell her that|Siago is looking for her. Steak, go tell Redhead... that Ze says if you kill Knockout|he'll leave you alone. - Did you hear that, Knockout?|- Get the kid! If you don't stay with us,|you're dead. Come with us.|We'll be partners. I do not like drugs.|it's between me and him. They are scum. They'd do|anything for power. Like the kid here,|they are all like robots. Do you have shit inside your head? Don't you understand that you are| wasted on this maniac? You are a kiddo! Kid, huh? I sniff, I steal|I kill. I am man! He is stuck to his gang. Come with us We will slice you, Steak. Ok, I accept. Tell him that Redhead and Knockout|are in charge. With one condition:|I don't kill innocents. - I won't tolerate it.|- OK, no innocents. Steak is fucked up. - Have you got a gun?|- We'll rob a gun store. I don't rob anything.|I am not a gangster. I have something personal with him.||I am not a robber.

Bring the revolvers! ...Knockout Ned saved|a dealer from Redhead. We said no killings.|It's a rule! We want the boss's money! Open the tills! Do you want to leave? Well, so do we! The second time, Redhead|saved Knockout Ned learned that rules|have exceptions. An exception. Are you the director?|Robbery! Everybody down! I don't play. Whoever moves|will be shot! The third time,|the exception became a rule. With the money from the robberies|they would face Ze. Redhead would protect his business. Knockout, the best|shooter, wanted revenge. The Italian first.|This is 9mm. - It's not aligned.|- You 'll get it at a good price. This is a 12mm.|We call it ''crap''. Uzi, 9mm. From Israel.|David's star. I want a 30-06. It's party time! The war begins.|Let's pray. Our Father,|who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name... Gangsters have the guns|but they don't shoot. Knockout's one bullet|was like ten of Ze's bullets. Ze couldn't stand it.|He counter-attacked. The ghetto was like Hell|but now it had become Hell! I decided to get out.|That's how I became a journalist. Nice picture!|That's Rogerio Ris's for sure. What was I saying? As every professional... I started from the lowest level,|from the bottom. Without knowing|what was ahead of me... Instead of going home|I went to the newspaper's offices. Someone from the City Of God|worked in the laboratory. He helped me to fulfil|my life's dream. Rogerio, this is|the Rocket - photographer. - He is an admirer of yours.|- You have a good taste, Rocket. I am leaving. Nice guy! What should have been swift revenge|turned into an all out war. The City of God was been divided. You couldn't go from one section the other... not even to visit a relative. The cops considered anyone living|in the slum a hoodlum. People got used to living in Vietnam... and more and more volunteers|signed up to die. The Kids. Somebody hit me. The war|was forgiving everything. One of Ze's guys kicked me. Take this. He raped my sister... - Ze took our home.|- Kill for your pride. I am Siago,|Benny's friend. You know how to read?|Spell? - I am good.|- You are hired. To revenge my father's|killer. - What's your name?|- My name is Otto. What's happening? - He works.|- He needs a gun. He won't last a week. A year later, nobody|remembered how it all started. The aim was to take out|the enemy's business... to buy guns and to extend|the enterprise. I sniff, I killed, I stole.|I am man! The TV showed interest.|The police would intervene. A gangster from|the city of God was arrested. Manuel Massando,|also known as Knockout Ned, has been hospitaled after being attacked |by Ze's gang. He gave us an interview. - Does the war continue?|- Yes, it continues. Were many people killed? Many. Innocent mostly. If a person knowns me|that's enough for Ze to kill him. - Are the police absent?|- They hunt me, not him. I am in jail while he|kills people without a care. Knockout Ned believes|that the war will continue. The police promise|to disband the gangs. Bastard! I am the boss and he is|in the newspaper! - Did you find mine?|- Knockout's only. My name must be somewhere. - Can you read?|- The pictures. Nothing. - What the Hell are you doing?|- Those are the classifieds! Read everything! - There are no articles!|- Do you want to be shot? We'll show them|who is the boss! Give me the camera! - Take my picture.|- I don't know how it works. Take me. |Back... - It doesn't click.|- You fools. You fucked me, assholes. I'll call an acquaintance. - He came.|- Take the camera. Well, kid? Aren't you a photographer?|Take a picture of us. - You broke it.|- Not me. Needs some fixin'. - What's your name?|- Rocket. Take one more. Two lines.|With your guns. - You're out, dammit!|- Speak kindly. - Show us the pictures.|- We must develop these photos. How much does it cost? Take this money|and bring the pictures. - I have to remove the film.|- Keep the camera. Benny wanted to give it|to you. It's yours. Don't forget|the pictures. Pierre! can you develop|this film? I can't, Rocket,|I'll get into trouble. I work only for the newspaper. I'll get fired. Develop this, Pierre.|And this. I am going for lunch. You are lucky.|Dimensions? For the enlargement. Whatever you think is better. I am in big trouble. I am dead. Somebody signed|his conviction. I'll smash his face! You stole my pictures!|They will kill me! What are you talking about? They'll kill me|because of you! The pictures|were at the laboratory. Everything that is in the laboratory|is for publication. - I saw them, I published them.|- You stole them. - Give them to me.|- Here, take them. - Don't you have more?|- Relax. What's your name? Rocket?|Nice to meet you. Marina. Relax. I've got your money. When a picture is published|we pay the photographer. Do you want to become a photographer? Nice start with a front-page! - How did you take them?|- I live there. Not even one photographer|has managedto go to the ghetto. If you bring more|pictures of Ze... the newspaper will buy them. - Can you?|- I don't know. - What's the problem?|- I can't go there again at night. - And the day?|- It is a risk. At last they understood|that I'm the Boss. What's the name of this photographer|friend of yours? He is good. I'll take it|to show him. Yes, or no?|It's a big chance. You made the right decision. I'll give you film, lenses|and another camera. Come to see the equipment|office. There is another problem.|Where am I going to sleep tonight? I can't go back. This one is 135 mm.|Do you shoot from near or from a distance? - Can you measure the light?|- Yes. Don't you think you are too close? I don't know how I managed|to talk to them like this. Maybe I was about to die|but I had a camera... and a chance|to become a photographer. What is more, we had|the whole night to ourselves. - Do you want to eat something ?|- No thanks. Won't you eat, or drink?|A joint? Try this. Time to sleep. - I'll show you your bed|- Have you got hot water? Yes, haven't you ever|tried a hot bath? No. We got boiling water|from the saucepan. - Why are you standing there?|- In which room am I going to sleep? Unfortunately, I have only one room.|We will sleep together. I won't tell you much|about my first sexual experience. Somewhere else, another one, a more important|erotic scene was taking place. Redhead was helping|Knockout escape. without a shot. The guard was in|the hands of the nurse. Meanwhile, Ze|was investing in ammo... To terminate|Redhead. He was heavily equipped even though|he didn't have to pay. Do you remember the shotgun? |It is a semi-automatic shotgun. You haven't seen a Browning like this.|It can even shoot down aeroplanes. I want what I asked for.|The American AR-15. - They don't exist in Brazil.|- I don't give a shit. I've got the solution. Rouger.|Have you seen this before? Like the AR-15. Same calibre|but lighter. With infra-red vision ?|400 rounds per minute? Are you trying to fool me?|I'll fuck you. Go now. No money,|no guns. - What am I supposed to say to the boss?|- Your problem. Think of something. Beat it, Fatty Ze made a big mistake.|He didn't know that... behind every dealer,|there is a big trader. Did you see this?|Why do they want an AR-15? They will make investigations.|Cops. We'll get busted. Do you think that I would betray you? I'll fix it, but|don't get involved again. Charlie! Come here. Tell him... Let's go now to the fucking dealer. Come here, kids. - Do you like chicken?|- It depends. We'll eat chicken and|for dessert... Redhead. I have a gift for you. - One big one for you.|- Are you giving us guns ? Yes, but I want you beside me|against Redhead. - Can we steal later?|- Not in the ghetto. - Do you know how to shoot?|- More or less. Come and help|the kids! I know. You do it like this. THE BEGINING OF THE END Grab the chicken! If Ze catches you|he'll kill you. He has to find me first. Kid, grab the chicken! - The Cops!|- Don't run away! Buttheads! Fuckin' faggots!|Get the hell outta here! Let them kill|each other Rocket!|Take a picture of us! Why are you standing like that? Kill the mothafucker! - Relax, don't move.|- It hurts! Relax, Kid! Why did you join|this fuckin' war? Knockout Ned!|Ze is down! Hang on, I'll help you. - What's your name|- My name is Otto. I want revenge|for my father's death. Ze's down! Hang on. Cops! Down! Hands behind your head! - It's you that I want.|- You're through, pal. Handcuffs on him. - Rocket, where're you going?|- I got something to do. We got some arrangements to make, Ze. Not you. You're the gift|for the Media. - Is it 10'000?|- Almost. That's all I got. That's all, Boss.|We looked everywhere. Let him go. The ring? Is it gold? Fuck it.|You owe us the rest. Fuckin war! Knockout Ned is dead|and I'm broke! You're fucked, right? We'll do some robberies|to get back in my job. - Your job, Ze?|- Is it tough for you, boy? For our friend, mothafucker!|Attack! We are the Bosses! That photograph|will make me a professional. That photograph will make me famous. Maybe it'll make the front page|of a magazine. I won't worry about Ze any more. But the police? The Boss of the city|of God, falls down dead... That photograph|could kill us? - It gave you work.|- It made me international. - You made some money, right?|- Yeah, some... - That journalist? Was she good?|- Good enough. - You didn't like it?|- How would they know about fucking? Cocoa robbed three houses|at Bara. Let's do him. - Who killed Roger?|- Biff. Let's kill the Boss|and Gringo. It's just the two of us|plus three more... Have you ever heard|of the Red Brigade? No, but if they come|we'll do 'em. - Who knows how to write?|- Me, a little. Let's make|a hitlist! - Add Nightbird to the list.|- And Leonard! And the Chinese, he thinks he's too |important. Claudio also! Where is Giant? I forgot to tell you,|my name is not Rocket any more. I'm Wilson Rodriguez.|Photographer. Based on a true story Manuel Assando, also known as|'Knockout Ned', was hospitalised... after he was injured|by Ze's men. He gave us an interview. Many died.|Mostly innocent. Just for knowing me...|Just for being my friends. If someone thinks that|he knows me, he's dead. - Where are the police?|- They're after me, not him. I went to jail three times|while he kills undisturbed. They don't arrest him. Knockout Ned claims|that the war will continue. Police officers promise|to take down... both gangs|in the City Of God.
