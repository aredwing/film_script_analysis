She thinks she's better than she is, you know? Especially with her fucking British... ha ha... accent. I mean, like... Cigarettes? And you know, if he'd just manned the fuck up and cut... cut her loose... ...we could've enjoyed this trip, you know. Like tonight, for example, you know? We could have helped out your... What was her name? Marie? Maria? You know... We could've had a good time, like the four of us. What does it say? Can't you read it? It's Danish. We're in Berlin. We speak German here. Don't you guys speak five languages and all that shit? My boyfriend knows some Danish. We can ask him. I think we should keep your boyfriend out of this. Like it's you and me Against the world Fuck! Wait! Hon... Why do you have to be such an asshole? Look at this place. We should be in a hostel with dreadlocked Austrian girls. I'm in the middle here, okay? Jen? She says that the three of us aren't working together. What? Seriously? So I'm the fucking problem now? No, no, no. Look, I... I appreciate your openness to Jen coming in the first place, but don't you want to do this trip alone anyway? Alone? Why the fuck would I want to do it alone? If I wanted to do it alone, I would've done it 10 years ago. I would've stayed in a hostel, not a hotel. And I would've met plenty of people. And by people, I mean fucking hot girls. But that wasn't the plan. The plan was to do this together. You gotta put yourself in my position. What would you do? - No. - What do you mean, no? No, I'm not putting myself in your position 'cause I would never have brought a girlfriend on a guys' trip. Why do you listen to her anyway? I mean, you broke up with her already. No, we broke up last Christmas for three days. Do you remember Jason with Penny and all that back-and-forth back-and-forth shit and they still got married? How did that turn out? You're comparing Jen and me to Penny and anal beads? It's not the beads. It's what the beads represent. Can I help you? I need a map. Look at the size of the bed. I'm ready and waiting. It's bouncy? - That's sexy. - Yeah! That is really fucking sexy. I know it's sexy. There's a bar next door. I was gonna grab a beer. You wanna come? Go away! You guys took long enough. Jeremy's not coming. So are you tracking down your family tomorrow? That's why we're here, isn't it? I want to apologize. I honestly thought it would be okay, me coming on this trip, but... But what? It was obviously a bad idea. Yeah. I agree. This was a guys' trip. You have no idea how lucky you are to have Jeremy as a friend. You think this is funny? We have love. We have each other. I'm just worried because I think you're gonna be so fucking alone. - Shut up! - Excuse me? What the fuck do you want from me? This was a mistake. Sit. Please. There's something you and me need to acknowledge. And what's that? The night you met Jeremy, you wanted to fuck me first. And then Prague? Now, I know you were drunk, but still... You are the most pathetic guy I have ever met. Even now... I bet you wouldn't mind just a little quickie in the bathroom. All right. Whoa! All right! Yeah! Okay? Just, let's make some noise. - Like what? - Just moan loud. Yeah, that's right. - I need you to moan loud. - Yeah! Yeah, that's right. Louder, like this. - Yeah! - Yeah! Come on, you can do it, that's it. Yeah! - All right. - Okay. Okay! Yeah! Shit, yeah! All right! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hey! What the fuck? We're going to London to get married. Jeremy proposed last night. He wrote you a note. It's all in there. Where is he? I'm sorry it couldn't work out. Look, I wanna talk to him. Just let us go. You wanna get some breakfast? I have to go to work. Call in sick. Fucking grammar, retard. You dropped this. You keep it. Can you help me with this, please? - You speak Danish, right? - Yeah. Yeah, right. What does this say? Fuck! - Shit. The address! - Sorry! No, no, read it. What's the address? - You didn't make a copy? - Idiot! What? English! I said it was your fault. No. The truth is you suck at your job. - This isn't even my job. - Good! Don't make a career out of it. I'm not going to tell you the address. Really? You read it? You didn't read it. Forhbningsholms Alle, number 49. Wait. Can you write that down? Where is it on the map? It's here. You're welcome. Hi. Hey, can you... Do you know where I am on this? All right, which way is north? Got it. It's that way, right? Stroger, Stroger, Stroger. Stroger? Fuck off, man. Cool hostel? Yeah. Do you know where this address is? I've been looking all day. I'm not from here. Sorry. Right. Me neither. Where you from? Canada. You? New York. Me too. But you just said you're from Canada. Isn't that what we're supposed to tell people? I think it's okay to be American again. - Okay. - Shh. So where in New York are you from? Jersey. Jersey. - What are you doing here? - Um... I have family here. I'm looking for them. What about you? I'm here with a friend doing like a tour thing. So what should I do? Where should I go? There's a club called Culture Box. - It's awesome. - A club. Yeah, like a nightclub. - Wow. - Here's my friend. Is that where you're going tonight? Um... No. Our bus leaves for Berlin in like two hours. Sucks. Really? I heard Berlin's cool. I mean it sucks that you are leaving. Well, see ya! What can I help you with? Just the bill for that, please, thanks. Are you here alone? You know, it is when you're all alone, with no friends, no family to lean on, that... that you find out if you are the kind of person that one can lean on. Great. Yes, yes, it is great. Listen... I am going to take a nap. Um... You care to lean on me? Jer! Fucking douche. What's going on? Seriously. Let's talk about this, all right? That's bullshit. She sucks, all right? And not in a good way. We both know it, okay? Just call me. Not cool, you know. That place you marked on my map was way off. No, it wasn't. I looked around all day. I know I'm not from here, but I asked people and everything. So where are you from? Canada. They kill baby seals there. I'm not really from Canada. Actually, I'm from Denmark, kind of. My father was born here. That address you destroyed was my grandfather's. Finding him is the only reason I'm in this city. I'm sorry I destroyed your paper. It was an accident. Look, I really need to find him. Are you sure you read it right? The address was right. Maybe I accidentally circled the wrong spot. Don't fuck with me. Look, I already told you. Forhbningsholms Alle, number 49. I can show you where it is, if you want. It's on my way home. But I'm going right now. You need a bike. Where am I gonna get a bike? 20 kroner. Fucking socialists. It's in here. Okay, um... what is the name? Rasmussen. Rasmussen. Yeah. It's here. First floor, door on the right side. Could you come in with me, please? Don't eat that shit, man. It has been there for years. This... This letter is for you. It's from my father. He's your father's uncle. Do... Do you know where my grandfather is? What? What's he saying? Your grandfather was a Nazi. What the fuck are you talking about? Good. You deserved that. What? I'm just translating for that demented fuck. They took the pictures and sent them to your grandfather in jail. What? What's he saying? They beat your grandmother for being with a Nazi. They shaved her head and spit in her face. What? What's he saying? You can keep them. Are you okay? Why wouldn't I be? How would I find my grandfather if he's alive? I don't know. Google? Wait. Where you going? Home. Thank you! You're still here. He's smiling. Happy. I never saw him smile in my entire life. So your father never told you anything about your grandfather? No. Can you ask him? He died last year. I never met my real father. Left before I was born. My father left when I was 14. When he died last year, alone, I was going through his things, and I found this letter he never sent. He wrote it when he was eight. What does it say? I don't know. You tell me. - You haven't read it yet? - No. It's very nice. Um, it says that he's missing Copenhagen, and that it will always be his home. And that when he gets a family, he wants them to see what made him smile. I know this. It's Tivoli. - Mark it on the map. - Why? Just do it. All right. Where's Tivoli on the map? It's where it says "Tivoli." The little mermaid... What are you doing? Have to see what made him smile. Let's go. Tivoli first. Hey, Jer, it's me. Fuck you. I didn't mean that. Look, if you get this, can you call me at, um... 45-87... 89-39. All right, fuck you. I forgive you. Seriously, call me, man. All right. Okay, we have to go over here. Castle's over here. Okay, go over there and see what he saw. What do you see? A bunch of annoying kids. Okay, I'm going to take the picture now. You one of those people? Do you mean this? It's cool. Okay, smile like your father. Is this what we're gonna do all day? You don't like Tivoli? It's boring. It's for kids. I can show you Sweden if you want. That's not boring. Shit. I need to get off this right now. God. God. - Look, that's Sweden. - What? I told you I would show you Sweden. That's Sweden. Sweden is on the other side of the water. I don't wanna open my eyes. You can't have your eyes closed. Open them. I hate you. Fuck. Fuck. What's happening? Fuck. Fuck. Okay. - It's beautiful, right? - Sure. - That bridge goes to Sweden. - What's happening? What was that? Has it stopped? Jesus! Fuck yeah! God! No, no, no. Make it stop! Whoo! God. That was fun, right? Mange tak. What else? How do you say, "What's your name?" Yeah, perfect. Something's written here. Look. It's very faded though. I think this is where your father was born. - What? - It's on Vaernademsvej. - Let me see. - I know where it is. Hey, we can go and check if your grandfather still lives there. Chances of that are zero. Yeah, but we can check. Maybe he does. Then you can give him the letter. Let's... Let's go. Sit down. What are you doing? Wh-Where are you going? - Let's try this. - What? Go to the door. You know... this would be a lot more fun if you were the other way around. Got it. Look. What are you... Are you insane? These people are not related to me. - Don't be a racist. - I'm out of here. No, wait. I think this is where the stove was. Who's Daniel? That was my father's name. - Was his last name Vinter? - No. Okay. That's my father's birthday. Whoa. Okay, all right. Let's go right now. No! We need to take a picture. Just stand where he is in the photo. No! I'm not leaving without the photo, so if you want me to get caught, you can just go. All right, come on. Okay, smile. - That was stupid. - You're boring. We broke into someone's place. We didn't break anything. You can apologize if you want to. Hi. - Hi. - Hi, hi. Okay, so your father was born Vinter. Vinter wasn't my father's last name, okay? But then it must be your grandfather's. You know, we can actually find out. My uncle, he works at the People's Registry. He can look it up. Then we can find your grandfather, and you can give him the letter. All right. All right. Good, let's go. That's hard. Fuck! That does it. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Swap... Stop, stop. Switch bikes. Ha ha! See? I'd say... I don't think I've ever been in love. I said it. There you go. I said it. I said it! Of course you've been in love. Fuck. What? What is it? My chain fell off. Hold on. Got it! Then the music started, and then I fainted. I don't know why. Really, I wasn't nervous. And you know... Well, like... voom! Yeah, and... Like smack! Yeah, on the stomach, right? Like down. And you know, I don't know if you know it, but when you faint, your body like stops working. No, I've seen a lot of girls faint. Yeah, yeah, I can see that. So... I shit my pants. And everyone saw it. No, wait, wait. I gotta stop. You literally evacuated your bowels? Yeah. - Hello? - Hi. Okay, he's on a break, but he'll be back soon. Do you want me to show you something really cool? Come. Wait. Don't we have to pay? No. Art is for the people. Come. How old are you? My real age is actually 345. I'm just trapped in this young body. Right. I'm a vampire. I feed off rats and tourists. Well, you can start by sucking my neck before moving on to... If I was a vampire, you'd be dead. Look. All right. I love this. Venus. She's beautiful. A little short. Nice tits. We're almost there. All right. What do you think? How is that possible? I told you. I'm a vampire. No, you said you were 345. Seriously, this is thousands of years old. Well, I lied about my age. I never showed this to anyone before. Close your eyes. Close them. Okay. Yeah, bye-bye. Bye. My uncle's back. So, um, Eva tells me that you are her friend's cousin from America. - Canada, actually. - Yeah. Toronto. Canada is not America. Right. North America, I guess. Mexico is America then, as well. Anyways, there were 165 children born in Denmark on January 15, 1944. Is any of them called Daniel Rasmussen? No, there's no record of a Daniel Rasmussen. What about Daniel Vinter? - Vinter? - Yeah. Yeah, but you needed Rasmussen. Rasmussen, right, yeah. First Rasmussen, then Vinter. Vinter. Daniel Vinter. Yes, there is a Daniel Vinter born that day. Is there any way to check that if that's the same Daniel, that's the same person? Listen, I... This can only tell the person's name, but cannot tell the relationships between them. This is not a wizard. This is a database system. If I know the name of your grandfather... - Okay, yeah, all right. - Do you know him? - No. - No. Then... if I knew his name, then I could find him. How was your praktik? It was fun. Morten got me a job at a hotel. Well, hotel is not a bad place to work. No. But you could do better. - We can find your grandfather. - What? Yeah, look. There is a year in the photo. What? What's the matter? - You got a splinter. - No. Here. You got tweezers? Sorry. That was a dick thing for your uncle to say about your job. What? You can do better than a hotel? My uncle is very nice. Still, don't listen to him. You want to work in a hotel, work in a hotel. I don't work in a hotel. It's my praktik. It's like my internship. What internship? Um... Everyone does one in school. You're in college? Big one. You okay? Um... I'm in... I'm in ground school. Next year I am going to high school. How old are you? I'm 14. No, you're not. Yes, I am. That's bullshit. No, it's not. What do you mean? Why? What why? That's great. That's just great. I'm 15 soon. You okay? What are you doing? - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong? You know, I came here to this stupid city, and my best friend ditches me to get married. I visit the only family I have on this entire planet, and I find out that my grandfather is a Nazi. And you're 14. If you don't want to go to the places in the photos, that's fine, but you still have to find your grandfather. How do we do that? We just need the baptism records, then we can find the name of the parents. I did a project in school last year about family trees, and I could go 200 years back. We just need to find the church. Family tree project in school? Jesus Christ. Okay, so we just need to find the church, then we can go get the records. - Are you listening? - Yeah. You think she's pretty? Yeah. Prettier than me? No. Apparently you're 14. She's old and still has it. Who knows where you'll end up. You're not that nice, you know? How the fuck can you be 14? Are these the baptism records? No. Um... Your father's uncle, he told us that this is where your father was baptized, and this church was built in 1887, so I'm looking for a church built in 1887. Here. I found it. They're making a copy of all the records from 1944. Good. Yeah. What a way to go. It's not the worst way to die. What's the worst way to die then? I think it's sharks. You're afraid of sharks? Yeah, they eat you. Imagine to be an animal that can get eaten. Must be so scary. Animals aren't aware of death. That's what separates us from them. And the thumbs. And marriage. Yeah. Animals just fuck. Don't look at me like that. Thank you, Father. He's not your father. - We need a computer. - What? We need a computer. All right, um... There's one in my hotel room. That could work. What happened to your computer? Pissed me off. Look. Come. Look. Okay. Your father was baptized Daniel Vinter. Mother, Marie Rasmussen, and father Thomas Vinter. Born January 15, 1944. Was your grandmother's name Marie? Yeah. Okay, that means that your grandfather's name... was Thomas, right? Right. Okay. And look. Thomas Vinter is still alive, and he lives in Skagen. So this is your grandfather. You found your grandfather. - Can we go there? - Yeah. It's in the other end of the country, but we can go there tomorrow, and you can give him the letter. Do you want to go and see these places before? What's that? It's a mosquito bite. - Activate! - Don't! Be serious. Why the fuck is this so important to you? I don't have any pictures of my father. I'm sorry. I never wanted to see what made my father smile. I just wanted... One time my father took a picture, and I crossed my arms just like this. He said, "I know what that means." So what does it mean? I was saying... "I don't need you. I can take care of myself." I was crossing my heart or... whatever. I need to tell you something. I lied. You're not 14. I knew it! Why the hell would you say that you were? No, I'm 14. That's not it. You made it itchy. Stop it. What did you lie about? Stop scratching. What did you lie about? - Let me scratch it. - Stop. Don't you... Stop! What did you lie about? What did you lie about? Stop it! What did you lie about? Um, I lied about what the letter said. Why would you lie about that? We had a nice day, didn't we? The room's fine! Will? Jer? - What the fuck? - Holy shit. I have been looking for you all day. - What? Where's Jen? - Shit's fucked up. - Well, now's not a good time. - Wow, sorry. I didn't know you had a... - I need to be home soon anyway. - No, don't go. Will, please, can we talk alone? It's fine. No. Let's go together. Is there somewhere we can all go? I know a place nearby. Summer holiday On a summer holiday On a summer holiday On a summer holiday Whoo! She left me. We flew to London, and when we arrived... What happened? She changed her mind. You flew to London and back? We went to the hotel, but you weren't there. - I tried calling you. - Where were you? I was visiting family, which I was supposed to do with you. No, it was fucking terrible. You don't understand what I went through. When we got there... I'll sing. Don't be a dick to her. Look, this is a good thing. Just man the fuck up, get laid, and you'll be fine. Effy! She gave me an ultimatum. Either I leave you, or she would leave me. - But you hate ultimatums. - I know. But she said that you... Did you read my letter? That was the hardest letter I ever wrote, not that I even write that many letters, unless you include e-mail in my scope of writing... Nice note you wrote him. That was private. So how long have you known William? Since we were seven. How old are you now? You know how they say all the greats die at 27? No. I'm 28. Sorry about your girlfriend leaving. I don't know how I came to this. She told me I lost myself in her. She needed space. I wanna tell you a story. It's about... What's going on? Telling him a story about Skagen. It's in the north of the country where the two oceans meet. I heard of this place. I went there once with my mother. She was sad because her boyfriend left. And I was sad because I had a fight with my best friend. So she brought me to the end of the beach, and then she pointed to the right where the Baltic Sea is. I knew that. Yeah, from Risk. So it's a very beautiful and very blue sea. The waves travel west. Current. What? Current, not waves. Waves... Current travels west, not waves. So the current travels west, and she pointed to the left. - North Sea? - Yeah. Also a very beautiful blue sea, but the current travels east. And then she pointed to the middle, and she said that... that is the perfect relationship. You can look to the left, and you can look to the right, and both seas are there, and they can meet in the middle, but they never lose themselves in each other. They're always themselves no matter what. That's beautiful. It's better than what he said. What did he say? To go out and get laid. That's terrible advice. - Shark bite! - What are you doing? It's a shark bite. You're afraid of sharks. Dude, you gave her a shark bite. Where are you going? Are you gonna read me the letter? - No. - The mermaid. We have to go. We need to see what made him smile. I thought you didn't care. Please. I'd like to go. It's getting dark. We have to hurry. But we need another one. Yeah. So find another one. What about that one? That's somebody's. They can't do that. If they're not using it, they should put it back. Yeah, but if you take it, you're stealing their money. We don't need the money. We need the bike, right? You gonna steal it? Yeah, I'm stealing it. You can't steal something that's free. Like love. We're going this way, so you can just catch up with us. Okay. Walking, walking... Hey! - Hey! - Go! - No. - Go! Sorry. Sorry. We're Americans. Sorry. He's going for the Tour de France, man. I mean, look, it's the same as the States. It's just good to remember it, that's all. - We're almost there. - All right. Do you think there's gonna be somewhere to buy like some snacks or anything like that? It's here! Where? - What happened? - Shit. Fucking great. I just need a second for my eyes to adjust. - Nobody move. - What now? I think we should go back to the lighted area. Maybe our eyes will adjust in a couple seconds, then we can catch a glimpse. No, I think we should go back to where the light is. There's no one here, and it's dark, and my eyes are not adjusted. It's okay. It's working. My eyes... I'm starting to see things. Relax, all right? Can I have one, too? What, you're allowed to smoke now? Yes. Here. Yeah. Here, have your own. If this was a war, you'd be dead. Why do you say that? Third light. Everyone knows that. Triangulation. Come on, Jer. Jesus Christ. - Say cheese. - What? - Damn! - Jesus Christ. I saw the mermaid when the flash went off! Do it again. There! There! She's right there! - Let's get closer. - I didn't see it. Go again. It's so small. I need to do the pose. No. Don't go down on the rocks when it's dark. Fuck! - William? - Will, man, you okay? Fuck you! What did we do? He's talking to his dad. Let's try again. Effy, come here. What are you doing? Trust me. You went to all these places today? Yeah, and we found his grandfather in Skagen. You found your family? I did. My dad's dad. He's alive. Done. I heard Culture Box is good. We should go there. Yeah, my friend's older brother, he works there, so we don't have to show ID. How old are you? I'm 14. Seriously? 15 soon. Okay. You've been hanging out all day with a 14-year-old? Use your common sense. H-He's that stranger you're not supposed to talk to. - He's dangerous. - All right, man, relax. It's not what you think, all right? Nothing's happened. I walked in on you, okay? - Don't lie to me again. - What's going on? I'm not lying. She is 14 years old. Jer. Jer! Jer! You know, every time I think you've hit rock bottom, you find a lower level! You know, it's not enough that you destroy every fucking thing you touch. - Now you're a pedophile. - A pedophile? You don't know what you're talking about. You're a fucking locust. Stop scaring her. Scaring her? You're an asshole, okay? Nobody likes you. You connect with teenagers. Who the fuck are you to talk? Did you leave your best friend for some bitch just 'cause you get some for the first time in years? You tried to fuck Jen. What? Why would she lie to me? Just tell me the truth. Is that what she told you? Fuck you, man. Yeah, that's right. Walk away. Get off me! I'll fucking DDT you, man! I swear it, I will! Stop it! Stop it, man! Stop! Listen to me. I didn't try anything, all right? I tested her because I don't trust her. That's all. I don't believe you. Where the fuck you going, man? Where is she? Where is she? Effy? Jeremy, you don't know where you're going! Hey! Hi. It's me. It sounded like your voice, so I guess it's you. Thanks for the help. Yeah. I'm done with visiting my grandfather, but, um... I don't know why you left. We should go to Culture Box, get a proper goodbye, that's all. Call me back. Wait. Never mind. Yeah, okay, um... Have a good one, I guess. Life. By one, I meant life. Have a good life. I just... It's me again. I just wanted you to know that I didn't mean that in a snarky, fuck off, have-a-good-life way. I meant it genuinely. Seriously. Have a good life. Hey, hey. My God! You came! I'm so happy you came! What happened to Berlin? Where? You said you were going to Berlin. You wanna do shots? Yeah. All right. Your go. Your go. I... I have to go. I think I'm in love. - Hey. - Hey. You came. Yeah. - Did you get my message? - Yeah. I just wanted to give you this. It's important that you give it to your grandfather. Are you gonna tell me what it says? Where's Jeremy? I don't care. Why did he say all that stuff about you? Let's get out of here. We can stay. What was that all about? I told him that you're my boyfriend. I think I'm in love with you. It was just to get rid of him. - Cheers. - Skoal! Skoal! You're supposed to slam it. I don't want to slam it. It's too strong like that. Come on. Whoo! Are you going to visit Thomas Vinter in Skagen tomorrow? Only... Only if you come with me. Are you trying to get me drunk? What? No, no, no. No, that's not it. You're trying to get yourself drunk. - Shark bite! - That hurt! Look, I'm sorry about the shark bite, all right? I know it's primitive, but it's a sign of affection. Teenagers do shit like that all the time. I don't like teenagers. Good point. All right. Get me back. You can get me back. Come on. Okay. Block! You told me I could do it! I'm not just gonna let you do it. Watch out! What... Let's do it for real. Close your eyes. - What? - Close your eyes. Come on, it's fair. Shark slap. - Shark slap? What the fuck? - Shark punch! What are you doing? Stop it! Let's dance. Close your eyes. Promise you're not gonna slap me? I promise. Shark kiss. You trying to get me in trouble? I promise you won't get in trouble. Let's get some more to drink. You buy the drinks. I gotta take a piss. Excuse me? American? Yeah. Yes, I am. Make sure you don't piss on your leg. Hey! Where'd you go? Wait! Whoa! Hey! What's going on? American boy, stay out of this. Who are you? Who is he? Just wait a minute. It's fine. Hey, let go of her. This is none of your business. You're making it my business. I said let go of her! Stop it, stop it! Fuck! Hey, hey, whoa! You taking a swing at me? Relax, man. You're being aggressive. Let's talk about this like adults. Please stop. Aah! What are you doing? Fuck! - Are you okay? - I'm so fucked. You just punched my mom's boyfriend. Room 340. Okay. I see there's only one person registered to this room. We'll need a passport for the young lady. Excuse me? We'll need a copy of the passport for anyone staying in the hotel. It is the rules. Interpol. Yeah, okay? She needs a passport. Let's go. Stay here, okay? What are you doing in here? I told you to wait outside. When the night is gone Stay with me Stay with me awake Somewhere in the sun Hold my hand Stay with me awhile Enjoy your evening? Asshole. I need some water. Here. We can go to Skagen tomorrow if you want. What about you? Yeah. I'm like a leave falling from a tree. Wherever the wind blows, I'll go. I love you. You told me you loved me already. Do you want me? Yeah. You shouldn't be doing that. It's illegal. I'll be 15 in a couple of days. I promise nothing bad will happen. It's been ringing all morning. It's my mom's boyfriend. Five missed calls. You wanna grab a coffee? I don't drink coffee. Of course you don't. You know how I told you that, um... I never saw my father smile? I saw him smile once. The day he left. And we went to a ballgame. He... took me to a restaurant. He told me things would be different. So he drops me off, and I walk up to the door, and right before I go in, I turn to him, and he smiled... right at me. Then he disappeared. I never saw him again. What kind of prick smiles at his son, then leaves? He smiled because he believed it. Just didn't know how to do it. Fuck that day. Wish it never happened. You should go home. I should read you the letter first. "Dear Father, I haven't been happy since we moved here, not since Mads took me around in Copenhagen and told me to look happy in the pictures for you. We're in America now, and I hate it here. I peed in my pants in class because I didn't know the words... to ask how to go to the toilet. I hate it here. Do you know what else I hate? You. I will never be like you. If you think about me, don't, because I don't think about you. Daniel." Thank you. He did leave this for you, Mr. Jeremy. Yeah, thanks. Okay. Thanks. Thomas Vinter? Yes? My father was born Daniel Vinter. He was your son. I had once a boy called Daniel Vinter. It's many years ago. That's my father. You're my grandfather. Look, I have five grandchildren now, and they are all playing inside the house. Wait. I just came here to give you this. How is your father? He's dead. I'm sorry. Was he a good father to you? No. He wasn't. But I guess he wouldn't know how, would he?
