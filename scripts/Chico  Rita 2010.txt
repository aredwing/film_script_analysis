Chico and Rita! A song that was a hit more than fifty years ago. By Chico and Rita. You're listening to "Yesterday's Melodies" on Radio Progreso. I never meant to own you, I was a nobody, lacking vanity I gave you The best of my life You have a marvelous voice. One of those voices that you have to listen to with your eyes closed. Of course, in your case it would be a shame. You see those girls over there? I could take any one of them and make a star out of her. They're dying for somebody to discover them. Like I've done with you. What's your price? The price of success is success. I mean real success. And I'm not talking Havana. I'm talking New York! New York? My dream! Is that a "yes"? It's an "of course" as in "when do we leave?". Now you're talking! But where's Chico's name? Chico? Hey, honey, how can I leave without him? New York is full of piano players. Chico's not just a piano player. Chico is... well, Chico. Wait. Leave me alone! Is that what you like? Having these guys at your beck and call? I'm sure you didn't tell him to get lost. You were straight in there. And where are you going with him? Oh, let me guess. Why settle for a shit-hole of a room when you can have a suite at the Nacional? All settled. I still don't see Chico's name. Two names or none! Chico! Chico! What's up? - I'm looking for Chico. - I didn't hear him arrive. She hears what she wants to hear. She says she's deaf, but she doesn't miss a thing. - Well, you two sure keep her busy. - They keep me up every night. If you want to come up here, we can wait for him together. - Pour me another! - Ok, but this one's your last. C'mon, man, why don't you go home and sleep it off? Hey, Juana. Do me a favor and take him home with you. No problem. Hey, baby. Don't worry. Mommy's gonna take good care of you. She'll put you to bed, tuck you in... Juana, I can walk on my own, ok? Who loves you, baby? Who loves you, Chico? Exactly, who loves me, huh? Your Juanita... Chico. Ramon! So you were leaving without saying goodbye? Do you want me to say anything to him? Yeah. Tell him I don't ever want to see him again! You know something? I never would have let you go. It's a pity I didn't fall in love with you. A pity. Ok, so we're all square! Chico! I know how to find Chano Pozo. His sister gave me a letter for him. He can make it happen for us over there in New York. My name is Chico! It used to be. Chico! Chico, get up! Chico! Chico, get up! - Get up, brother! - What's going on? Guess what? We're arriving! New York! New York! Dammit! Careful, bro. Let's go. Rita should be getting ready for the first show. - Rita Labelle? - La-belle. I like it. Sounds classy. Follow me! Come on. For Rita Labelle? I'll take them, thanks. Here! Wait. I'll do the honors! Scram! "I needed to kiss you again" What are you doing here? Didn't Ramon tell you that I never wanted to see you again? - I need to talk to you. - Where's your girlfriend? - Why didn't you bring her? - She means nothing to me! That's what you said, and then I found you two making out! Enough already! One day you drop me, the next you come looking for me! You think you can do what you want with me? Rita, I know I've been a jerk, but I'm here now and I love you. We're not... in Cuba and I'm not the girl you used to know! You're still the same girl to me! Don't you realize that everything's changed? Look at me! That girl you reduced to tears stayed back in Havana! Go away! Get outta here! Go and don't come back! Whatever you say. Come on, it's not the end of the world. Hey, we're in New York! Look... I think this is the place. It's Charlie Parker! Look, that one over there is Chano Pozo! Chano Pozo! Hey, who's the guy with the hat? Where did you two escape from? Did Cuba sink or something? I was supposed to be down South right now with Dizzy Gillespie. But you know why I'm here? Because we're not allowed in a lot of places down there either. We have to use the service entrance at hotels, sit in the back of buses. There are even different bathrooms. There are more sons of bitches there than in Cuba, man. Shit, be careful! Gotta keep movin'. You did right in coming. Machito, Mario Bauza, Miguelito Valdes, Arsenio... They're all here. People are crazy about Cuban music. All they wanna dance is mambo, conga... Our time has come! Let's get high! - What the hell is this? - Let me see. Shit! I think they sold you oregano! - Oregano? - Oregano! Gimme that! That son of a bitch! - C'mon, man, let's go! - Where? If you think you can cheat me, you better think again! Listen up, Cabito! Nobody cheats Chano Pozo! Tell your friends. Nobody screws with Chano Pozo! Here, rule number one is: respect! Your beers are gonna get warm! It's party time! Cuba! New York! What's that Bebop shit? Cu-bop! That's what it is! Mantecaaa! Chano! Chano... Chano! Chano Pozo, To your memory I sing this rumba as a tribute to your work May God take you in His bosom and offer you His goodness May the Holy Spirit help you rest in peace Chano Pozo, Chano Pozo, Cuba and the rumba mourn for you Those juicy contracts will be coming soon. Trust me. This is just to keep you finely tuned. What now? Another birthday for white kids? It's a private party on Park Avenue for some big fish. I think a Hollywood producer is gonna be there. At least, you'll eat well! - Where did you leave the car? - We'll go in yours! We'll do what? Kidney beans! Eat, baby, eat! - That's delicious! - Sit down, sit down! It's an honor to have you right here in my kitchen! You look like a Yankee! But I still like kidney beans. I've seen you in magazines. You're headed for Hollywood, right? Aren't you tired of playing Miss Charming? Don't you like me sitting by your side eating kidney beans? I like it so much it frightens me. - What are you frightened of? - Same thing as you. Why should I be frightened? Of listening to your heart for once. Of leaving your cage and not finding your way back. You really believe that? Come with me! Don't tell me you're gonna leave without finishing. Yes! Are you coming or not? Oh, Mary, Mother of God, what is this? Easy does it! Careful! - Shit! Damn American cars! - Careful! - What are you looking at? - Nothing, nothing! - So wipe that smirk off your face! - Ok. Rita Martinez. What are you mumbling about? Rita... "I needed to kiss you again" Yeah, same ol' shit! Yes, yes, yes. Don't tell me that horse finally won? What's its name? Do you remember that investor I told you about? No. Well, our hard times are over, Chico. From now on, - straight to the top! - Maybe you are. So are you. Look. - What is this? - It's a contract. Dizzy Gillespie needs a piano player for his band. Tomorrow you fly to Europe. A month in Paris and then a tour! The opportunity of a lifetime, Chico! Sorry, dear, for being late. - I had no-one to take care of Lily. - Lily? My puppy. She's like a baby. She can't be left alone. Are you sure you don't want to go for a stroll? No! I've been told this film is really good! Oh, c'mon. The music is so lovely, and she's such a good performer! Hi, Lily! Like it? Another blackout! What do you need light for at this ungodly hour? Go to sleep! Tomorrow we've gotta work for our country. He was reading Granma and the lights went out just when it was getting interesting. I dream I love you as I did yesterday. Sweet scents are reborn and come into play My soul takes flight and recalls moments divine Echoes of kisses, two destinies, yours and mine Rita! - What a surprise! - Where is he? I need to talk to him! Please Rita, don't go looking for problems, just when things are going so well. - For who? - For all of us! And above all, for you! You can't be fighting with Ron every night. Don't you get it? I can't stand him! But, you mean everything to him! Yeah, I'm his biggest investment! - True, but he made you what you are. - Yeah. A miserable wretch! And who could make you happy, Rita? Who? You mind telling me who the hell Lily is? Lily? Yeah, Lily! What's wrong with you? Are you deaf? I met her in Paris. She used to sit by my side whenever I played the piano. You must have been very fond of her to write a beautiful song like that. Well... who hasn't been in love at least once in their life? What happened to her? She passed away. I'm sorry. She also used to like to lick my hand. Bitch! She was a tiny dog, silly. It'd be better ifwe didn't see each other for a few days. New Years Eve, I debut at the Hotel Pelican in Vegas. Come the day before... Have you thought about your career? About your future? Future, what future? The future never gave me anything! All my hopes are set on the past. I haven't seen that expression for years! I'm tying the knot! Congratulations! When? New Year's Eve in Las Vegas. Are you sure no-one by that name was on the plane to Vegas? Ok. Thanks. What were you expecting? He did it before! And good ol' Ron is always there for me, right? Stop drinking! Don't spoil it all now! Your passport will be withheld until further notice. What? Chico? They've cancelled tonight's show! What? They don't like this kind of music any more. Jazz is considered imperialist. It's the enemy's music! If you wanna keep on working, you'll have to join the Party. - That's it! - But, that's crazy! Viva Fidel! And then there was light, brothers. Now they're screwing with us in the middle of the night. So the whole point is to protest. The light goes out, complain, it comes back on... Comrade, it's just that I was dreaming about... Well, you know about who. Who? About you, baby, who else? I gotta tell the world about it. Chico! Chico! Chico! Piss off! There are some gringos asking about you! What are you saying? That singer and her producers. You know that young singer, man, the pretty one, that big star! Let them find somebody else. I'm not a musician any more. They know that but when they heard you were still alive, they went nuts! Who said I'm alive? It's been years since I've been this close to one. Maestro... Don't call me Maestro. Call me Chico. I've got all your records. How's it possible that a girl as young and pretty as you can own all those old records? That's my favorite song. I've always dreamed of recording it. "Lily"! Lily... I thought... What? That I'd never see you again. I've been waiting Waiting for you everyday to knock on this door. And, just like that, you're here. No call, no nothing. You haven't changed. You look as beautiful as ever. Oh, Chico! All this time... you were... you were here? They were nice to me. They let me have this room in exchange for my doing the house-keeping. May I come in? to Bebo
