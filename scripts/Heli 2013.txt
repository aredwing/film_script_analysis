An environment which guarantees rights and the protection of property by the enforcement of the law. Thank you very much. I have a damn flat tire. Too bad, you'll have to walk. See you. Damn! Excuse me, dog. Come up! Tomorrow I will sell it but we need a place to hide it until then. What then? Then, we'll go to Zacatecas and get married. Alright. Come here so I can kiss you. Who's there? It's me. Who jumped? - No one. - Liar! He was a friend. What were you doing here? Nothing. Let go of me! Heli! Estela! What's going on? - I'll be waiting for you here. - Seriously? Don't step out of the school. Give me your mobile. You're being really mean to me! I'm back. We're out of water! I'll check! I'm going out. Where to? To pick some prickly pears, I'll be back soon. Alright. I'm meeting Rosalinda later. Will you take Santiago? Yes. Do you want to confess to me or to the police? Let me go! Where are the packages? I threw them away! Let me go! You've ruined everything! I don't think so. Open it! Son of a bitch! I hate you! Sabrina! I'm going to marry Beto! And I'll never come back! I really hate you! Aren't you going to work? I've locked up Estela. Because of her boyfriend? Yes. You need to go to work or they'll fire you. Go, even if you're late. My dad's here. Let's take this door down! Hands up! Don't move! Freeze, fucking dog! Don't move, you idiot! I can explain everything! Where are the packages? I'm asking you! Where are the packages? I'm asking you! Don't move, you idiot! What are you looking at, fucker? Into the truck, you prick! Get in, I don't have all day! It wasn't me! He will take us where he threw them! Let's go! Beto... Keep your eyes ahead, asshole! Don't worry, little girl, it won't hurt. - Don't touch her! - Keep still! Don't move, bastard! Keep still! He stole them. Shut the fuck up or I'll shoot you, son of a bitch! Don't touch me, please don't touch me! You're screwed now. - Don't leave him here! - Keep still! Dad! So don't you feel a bit lighter? Like... as if you were more present? I resent Heli a little bit. Because he took me away from my family, my friends, my home... How's that? Well, he didn't force me. We fell in love. He refused to live in Durango and we moved here with his family. That's far. Yes, it is. Don't they come to visit you? My mom doesn't like Heli. Just because he took me so far away. You'd like to have a profession. Yes! That's what's troubling you. I'd like to be a nurse, like my mom. You'll have a long professional career. That will bring you spiritual satisfaction. As long as you follow the right path. You're from Durango? Now you'll get to know God in the land of the damned. This bastard isn't out yet. Good evening. Pay more attention, you fool! - Which one is Alberto? - This one. Beto! - Please, let us go. - Shut up! Please! Don't hit him! Which one do you want, blonde? Where are you taking her? In you go, bastard! It didn't work. That's right. Hold it. You're really fucked now, son of a bitch! My sister! - What have you done to her? - Shut up! Just like Christmas presents. Hey man, pass me a beer. Get one for me too. Damn it, man. - Maruchan. - Don't fuck with me. Give me all three. No way, man. Damn cheapskate. Fucking girl, fag. Faggot! For messing around with others' property. These guys are worthless. That's for being a smart ass. That's for being a smart ass. You rat. Why so gentle? Hold on, I'm just getting started. This is an inquisition, buddy! He's passed out. Does it hurt nice, comrade? Are you sorry now? Here, Guayo. Take it! I don't feel like it. Guayo, you damn fag. Here, Morocho. Maruchan! It's your turn now. Open your eyes so you don't miss the show. What did this one do? Who knows. Take a look so you can tell everyone what happens to rats. Record it, man. We'll put it on YouTube. What is that? It doesn't smell. I don't know, they gave it to me. The cock has crowed. Pass it here. Careful, it's loaded. He stinks of burnt shrimp! Now it's your turn, princess. Grab him! You're going to like this! Didn't you see what a great time he had? We don't burn this one. Just a little taste. Today's your lucky day. Hold his legs! Leave him there. Let's go! Yes, honey. We've been here for a while... Hold on. We need to find Estela. How many were there? Dressed in special police force uniforms, in a black SUV. Was it a numbered vehicle? I don't know. Is this the right way? Yes. Any idea where they took your sister? No. We'll see to your injuries soon, honey. Let's first see if we can find your father. A mountain lion or a puma may have taken him. A puma? Yeah, right! There are pumas here! One was run over a while back. Omar! It hurts a lot? Do not move. Let's see... Up you go. Don't hurt him. How are you? So-so. I brought pictures of Estela. Very well. Let's pick up where we left off. Why did they take all of you? I don't know. The men arrived. They were soldiers or policemen. They shot your father and took you all. Yes. Your dad worked at the Hiro plant. Was he involved in any illegal activities, as far as you know? You're lying. About what? My dad just worked at the Hiro plant. But apparently, he shot first. They broke in. It was self-defense! Could you take us to the place where they were holding you? It's about an hour away from my house. Aberto Rios is the young man who was found hanging from the bridge. How long had you known him? I didn't know him. I didn't even know his name. Could you take us? To the bridge? No, to the place where they were holding you. If you don't cooperate, we can't help you. Better tell us the truth. I couldn't see where we were going. We need your signature here. To back up what you are telling us. Then we can take it to a judge and proceed with the case. What is this? It's an official statement. If I sign this, I'll be saying my dad was a criminal. No, if you sign we'll be able to find your sister. It was dark. They kept my head down. Like this. Abandoned in the municipality of Piedra Parada, placed upon the hood of their own patrol car, three severed heads were found. We only know that they were males. The bodies found inside the vehicle were dressed in special forces uniforms, with 2 written signs next to them thought to be addressed to criminal groups operating in the region. The municipal prosecutor read one of them. "You'll all end up like these guys. I'm after you, Goyo. " Followed by the initials in quote marks, "UFF". According to authorities, this could be the result of score settling among organized crime groups. The identity of the severed heads is unknown, although one of them could be of Captain Mora, who took part, a week earlier, - Who's this? in the burning of confiscated drugs. Just one moment, please. It's from work. Are you in? Hello? Hello, Heli. Don't be scared, we were waiting for you. You didn't give us your number, otherwise we'd have called you. How are you? We need to talk to you. It can be here or wherever you choose. I'd prefer somewhere else. I'll just let her in. - Will you be back for dinner? - Yes. Let's see what they want. Hi. What did they say? They asked me to sign a statement. But I blew them off. What about Estela? No news. What the hell would they know? I made you some huitlacoche tacos. They're in the fridge. I'm not hungry. Can you turn it off? Of course. I miss my dad. Stop it or you'll get too excited. Don't get mad. This is Heli Silva. Detective Maribel? Hello, Heli. What did you want to tell us? About my sister... What? The kid they hanged was her boyfriend. Was he? Yes. And he had stashed some packages in our water tank. Packages of what? Cocaine. Why are you telling me this now? It's been weighing on me. And if I don't say the truth, who knows what might happen to my sister. If she's still alive. You need all the information to find her, don't you? Yes, that's right. We need to open a new case file and send a motion to the proper judge. What for? Because it's a cold case by now. We need to open a new one with this information. If I had told you the stuff was in my house you'd have thought we were criminals. How long have you been married? For a year in February. You're just getting started. I almost got married some time ago. But a younger cadet stole him away from me. Do you want some? Come here. Don't be shy. Don't you like it, or what? I don't know. Are you gay? What's up with you, fucking idiot? I feel bad because of you. Don't speak of feeling bad. You must feel great here without my dad or Estela. I want to go away and leave you alone for a while. Let's go on the Ferris Wheel! The bastards fired me. Seriously? What are we going to do? I'll get another job, what else? How nice of them. Just when your father's job insurance expired. Open wide. Can you sit up, Estela? Take a deep breath. Breathe out. Once again. Beware that in this case an interruption is not possible. You'd have to travel to another state. What do you mean, doctor? An abortion. But I can check up on her once a week. I'd only charge you 150 pesos per visit. Why won't she speak? It must be the trauma the poor girl experienced. We can send her to a mental health specialist. Where were they holding you? Your friends want to talk to you. Don't you want to talk to them anymore? It seems she's not even going to talk to us. Don't worry. Just rest. We'll eat soon, OK?
