Let douse cigarettes and cigars. There is ban on smoking on public places. You've to pay fine for it. Neither smoking nor let others smoking. Smoking costs dearly. Everyone desires happiness. But at what cost? Smoking costs dearly. Smoking is injurious to your health.. ..to your loves ones too. You've to pay dearly for smoking. Good morning, guys. - Good morning, sir What's happening? Sir, we're doing the lighting. Fine, fine. Mohit, what's up? How did you call me today? No, man. Shooting. GH Mills. Royal Mansions. It's a feature. What? Tonight? For what? Narration. Narration only? Okay. I'll be there. Ma'am, shot is ready. Scene 10 by Take 1. And...action! What happened to Madam, Get the water quickly. "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" "Who will understand..." "..the sad story of the ghosts." "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" "What's happening in the name of progress?" "What's happening in the name of progress?" "The bulldozer's razing down our homes." "Shopping malls and Multiplex.." "..are snatching our graves." "O Government, hear our plea." "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" "There's no one with us." "There's no one with us." "Ghosts have become helpless." "We don't have the right to vote either." "Even the politicians shun us." "O Government, hear our plea." "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" "Where do we go?" What a scary structure, right? So old and dilapidated. Yes. Most of the disputed properties in Mumbai are in the same condition. Aditya, Do you remember that Ragini incident? Yes, that ghost affair. - Yes. Just imagine. Ragini must be going through some serious PR crises. Why such cheap publicity? Today's marketing mantra is.. ..any publicity is good publicity. If you want to promote your film. And her act worked. Her story was all over. News, TV, internet. Everywhere. Ghost stories intrigue everyone. No wonder that such films are made and run successfully. What happened? I really don't understand. In Raaz 3, Esha Gupta knows.. ..that the house she's living in is haunted. So why doesn't she just leave? Tanya, if you try to find logic in the ghost stories. ..then you are going to see only ghosts at the box-office window. And Bhootnath, Amitabh Bachchan is a ghost.. ..who is visible to a kid, but not Juhi Chawla. And in the climax, even Juhi Chawla can see him. Again Logic. It is up to the ghost to decide.. ..who can see him and who cannot. Mostly ghosts are seen.. ..to those people who are in trouble. Or someone who create troubles for them. Get it? Good morning, sir. You.. - Raju, sir. Raju writer. Oh yes yes. What are you doing here? Sir, I was here to see location with someone... I saw you here then I thought to meet you. That's the real job of a struggling writer. So, what do you want? - Sir I want one single chance. Sir, I've a superhit idea, sir. Sir, just give me one hearing. Sir FIMFARE, ZEE, IIFA, TOIFA, ..Even the Lion's club award will be yours sir. Sir, just hear me once. You are here also... Ok leave from here.. Get out. Mr. Gupta, remember I came to your office. Yes, unwanted. - And I hugged you.. ..in your last film's success party. Remember, sir. - You had crashed the gate at the party. And gulped down the entire bottle. Now Just get out from here, or I'll make you regret it. Mr. Gupta, What else can you do with me? I've been struggling for 5 years.. ..but I couldn't get one break. No place to stay, no food to eat. But no problem, sir. The day will come soon when.. ..a lucky director will accept my story.. ..and make a super-duper blockbuster film. And then it will be your loss, sir, not mine. Because I might be unfortunate.. ..but I have hunger in me, I've confidence. If you're hungry, go and have some fritters. Get out. I will, sir. I will eat that. But remember one thing. Those who eat fritters during their bad phase.. ..They will be exorbitant at their good time. Bye, sir. I wonder how he got in here. Filmy strugglers are like unwanted messages. No matter how many times you delete them they keep coming. It is very frustrating. Aditya, this is Hemantbhai. He will take us around. Hi, Hemantbhai. I am Aditya, Hi and this is Tanya, my AD. Which is the latest film that you made? No feature film yet. No feature film yet. Nice title. Hemant, he makes commercials. It's important to make commercials.. ..otherwise people don't like it. Are you casting Salman? Hemantbhai, he wants to say that I make ad-films. Advertisement films. - I see. The things that bore you.. ..between TV serials and news. Frustrating. In 1932, the workers burned this mill down to the ground. Frustrating. And from 1985 till now.. ..around 50-60 films have been shot here. 100 years ago, Gaindamal.. ..built this mansion on the plot next to his mill. To entertain his British guests. After the Lingering doubt shoot.. ..he's been renting it out for shootings again. You're the first director.. ..who's come here after that incident. Otherwise it was closed for the last one year. No income. It was frustrating. Wow. What a mansion, Hemantbhai. - Thank you. I want to see every part of this mansion and mill. But I am here only for half an hour. Come, Tanya. Well there are many rooms here. What do you exactly want? We want a room and a verandah. And if we can get the terrace, that will be even better. Mr. Director, here's your verandah. And here's the terrace. Is this what you wanted? Wow, great. It's Beautiful. Now this is nice. Listen, here our actor will swing on a chair. Right here. - Okay. And then we'll get the entire city in the background. Then the scene will look great. Script and storyboard is in the laptop. Should I switch it on? My dear Script is always in the director's mind. I don't need a laptop. Once Sumit will come.. ..then we'll finalize our shot divisions. Cool. And before that, let's see the entire house. You go ahead, I'll be right there. Hemantbhai. These actors can do anything for publicity. Gupta, stop gossiping. - No, sir. I was talking about Ragini's case. She saw a ghost during the shooting. I think these rumors are true. It's an old mansion. It has to be infested by ghosts. Has to be? It is. Don't smoke. Don't smoke. Tanya. Coming. Listen, smoke but be around. If you smoke alone.. ..the ghost will snatch your cigarette. What rubbish? - Ask them. This is the most beautiful room of the mansion. Wow, Hemantbhai. This is great. There's a bar and a stage too. Yes Beautiful. So many musical instruments. - Exactly. Is this a hall or a music room? This is where the entertainment would take place. Famous Dancers performed here. Renowned singers like Ustad Allauddin Khan.. ..Baiju Bawra sir harmonized this place. Hemantbhai. By the way, is this mansion really haunted? Yes, it is. Then it must have scary stories as well. This house has an unusual past. They say this house is cursed. After Gaindamal murdered by the hands of the Mill workers.. ..Gaindamal's soul roam around here in the mansion. Jesus! Aditya, change your ringtone. - Aditya, sir. What Aditya sir.. It's was scary. Yes, Sumit Da. Yes. Yes, I can hear. What, you're stuck? Oh, rail blockage against land acquisition. So what will we do now? No, the shoot is day after tomorrow. No, it's not possible tomorrow. I've an important meeting tomorrow. Yes. Fine, Ok! let me talk to Hemant. I'll try to get his permission. Okay. No. I won't stay. I won't stay back. Today, There's a hearing in the High Court for Royal Mansion. The great grandsons of Gaindamal.. ..are fighting in the court for this property. I've to go with them. It's frustrating. Hemant, leave the keys with the watchman. Who would come to a house that's haunted by ghosts. I did appoint one...but the ghosts drove him away. What are you saying? The entire house is filled with antiques. And everything must be expensive. Yes, they say that.. ..there's a huge treasure buried under this house too. You mean hidden treasure. People have seen golden coins of the British era. That's why I don't give the keys to anyone. Hemantbhai. Hemantbhai. - No, no. Have faith, I'll bring the keys. Tanya, please. - Hemantbhai, please. Please, please, please, let it be. Please. Please is what gets us in the end. Fine. Please. Here are the keys. Thank you so much. - Thank you very much. Thank you so much, Hemantbhai. Thank you. Really, Tanya. Your magical embrace cast a spell on Hemantbhai. Come on. I hugged him out of affection. Yes, right. Sir, what will we do for next two hours? I will have to wait for Sumit Da. I've to discuss the shot divisions with him. I suggest that you two go to the police station. And get the permissions for next week's shoot. That's a good idea. Yeah, even I've to meet with the costume dada, so.. Great. You guys get going then. Leave the keys with me. Okay. Will you manage it alone? - Yes. Camera, laptop. Thank you. - Take care. Yes, I will. Bye, sir. - Bye, Gupta. Sir. - Who is it? Who is it? Sir, it's me. Raju writer, sir. You? You're back again. What do you want now? Sir, neither money nor credit. I just need a break. Oh God! You don't need a break But I really need one from you. That's exactly what I want to give, sir. I want to give you a break to make a film on my story. I am just joking, sir. Sir, please hear my story once. Sir, I've done my research here.. ..and written a story about this place. My friend, I've told you many times.. ..I've no interest in hearing your story. Sir, but I am interested in telling you. FIMFARE, ZEE, IIFA, TOIFA, Even the Lion's club award will be yours sir. Thank you very much for the awards. But dude, I don't want to hear your story. Because I've got my own story for my first film. Hold on, sir. You wrote a story without me. Without me? Sorry. Sir, just joking. By the way, what's the genre? I mean what kind of a film is it? Action? Social? Thriller? Horror? Or one of those intellectual art films.. ..with a strong message. It's not like that. But what do you know about these intellectual art-house movies? Sir, I may look like a tramp.. ..but tramp only get the triumph. By the way, I am MA in Literature from Allahabad University. And member of the Cineclub in Allahabad. Fellini, Truffaut, Bergman.. ..and our very own Satyajit Ray, Gurudutt, Shantaram.. ..made such great films. I guess you're a big movie buff. Very big sir. Big one? Okay, how about the contemporary film-makers? Danny Boyle, Ang Lee, Christopher Nolan.. ..have you seen their work? Just tell me the movie name, sir.. ..I can tell you the entire screenplay, with dialogues. No, let it be. Sir. Can I say something? Stop making these ad-films. - Why is that? If a young talent like you do the slavery to this consumerism. And sell these soaps and toothpaste, doesn't look nice. Make a feature film. And say whatever you want. Sir, there's great fun in making a feature film, sir. But you just mentioned Satyajit Ray. - Yes, sir. Even he made ad-films first. And if we don't sell these soaps and toothpaste.. ..then what will we eat? And anyway, who will finance my independent film? Corporates are only interested in the number game and stars. That's true, sir. But, are you interested in making a feature film? Definitely. In fact, I also have a story in my mind. Hot Haryanvi. And for that I'm also meeting a producer. Well, you didn't hear my story.. ..but I will definitely hear your story. Don't worry, I won't leak it out. I can also sign an NDA for you. Non Disclosure Agreement. So the basic story is about a boy.. ..who plays in a band. Marriage band? No. Music band. Musical group. I see. Like beetles, etcetera. Something like that. But they only play Haryanvi music. - Oh! Haryanvi music? Hard to digest, but sounds interesting. Next, sir. Next. The parents of this boy.. ..want to fulfill their dreams through him. They want their son to become a musician. But the son knows.. ..he can never fulfill his parent's dreams. Because he's a bad musician. He doesn't have the talent to compose songs. He is out of tune. He's stuck in a strange non-creative limbo. He also has a girlfriend who loves him. But the boy hates love and affection. Same old wine in a new bottle. You said something? - No, sir. Nothing. Sir, what happens in the end? That's the problem. I just can't figure out what the end should be. I have characters, plot points, crises.. ..cinematic moments, but I can't think of.. ..what the resolution should be. The problem is by tomorrow.. ..I've to work out the end at any cost. Sir, if you don't mind can I say something? No, go ahead. Sir, throw your story in the dustbin. What? Sir, your story's got no impact. This was just the synopsis. When I tell you scene by scene you'll realize the real impact. Sir Raju writer is my name. Writing is my job. By hearing 2 minutes of the story.. I can imagine the entire screenplay and know what's going to happen next. Really? - Sir, you felt bad. No, sir. - That's why you're leaving me in the middle. I didn't feel bad, Sir, I heard your boring story.. ..so you got to hear my interesting story. You mean your story's better than mine. Sir, don't try to compare a diamond with a stone. I see. - Yes, sir. If you make a film on my story.. - I know, I know. Filmfare, Screen, Zee, IIFA, TOIFA.. ..we'll even bag the Lions Club award. Right? - Yes, sir. What are you? - The best, sir. Fine, you win I lose. Sir, I love you. - What are you doing? I love you. - Stay away. Come on, tell me your story. Okay, sir. So, we begin our story from a smoke. Smoke? - Yes. Sir, the signing. - Oh, you want money already. Sir, cigarette. Yes. Here you go. - Yes, sir. Now light it. Take a puff. There'll be smoke all around. And with the smoke the story starts. Sir, the old mills and buildings.. ..are disappearing from the city. From the mills between Lower Parel and Mahalaxmi.. ..to the old house between Bandra and Colaba.. ..were devoured by the wind of development. From British rule to Indian rule. And now it feels like we're living in the promoter's rule. Old structures are being razed down.. ..to build 7 star hotels. New condominiums are being built every day. Multiplexes, shopping malls. By the grace of God.. ..and some new Municipal rules.. ..heritage and disputed properties are still intact. But they are few in numbers. The question is.. ..who's most bothered by the city's development? Mumbaikars. I mean, all this is forcing a common Mumbaikar.. ..to leave the city and go out. No, sir. That problem was always there.. ..and it will always be there. But the demolition of mills and houses.. ..has put Mumbai's spirit in danger. Spirit? Oh, I see. You mean the Mumbai spirit? - No, sir. Not that spirit. By spirit I mean ghosts, souls. Dead people. Sir, they're in a terrible state. They are ruined. These old houses and mills.. ..used to be their den. You can also call it their dwelling place. And now those simple, nave ghosts.. ..are facing a big crises. They are wandering from one place to another.. ..like crazy homeless souls. And the few homes that are left are not enough for all of them. Because their population is more than the number of homes. And sir, the worst part is.. ..no one's paying attention to the ghost community.. ..during their time of crises. The government isn't introducing any scheme.. ..to resettle them. No one's starting any movement. Ruling party, opposition party, civil societies.. ..and even the media isn't ready to help them.. Because their viewership doesn't depend on ghosts. Exactly, sir. You're on the mark. Because they are neither consumers nor voters. Very good. I can sense political satire in your story. But there shouldn't be any lecture or long speeches.. ..to deliver a social message. I like films which has layers. Something that has ups and downs. Sir, you'll find layers after layers.. ..in Raju Writer's story. With all commercial ingredients. Crime, passion, thrill, music, romance, dance. After all, these things make.. ..a great Indian pot boiler. Fine, let's listen. We'll start our story with the character of.. ..Raibahadur Mr. Gendamal Hemraj. Isn't he the same person Hemant was talking about? Yes, sir. In return of selling his mills to the British.. ..he got the title of Raibahardur from the British. And on that occasion, there's a celebration in the mansion. Cheers! Cheers! On one side there were celebrations.. ..and on the other, the mill workers.. ..were fuming with hatred. Right after taking over the mills.. ..the Britishers cut down their salary and wages. And the Mill Worker Unions.. ..staged a strike against this cruelty. Gendamal was supporting the Britishers.. ..and wasn't ready to bow before the demands of the workers. Down with.. - Gendamal! Down with.. - Gendamal! Down with.. - Gendamal! The workers were gripped with starvation and sickness. And in a fit of rage they burnt the mill down to ashes. Save me! After his death, Raibahadur Gendamal.. ..decided to stay in this mansion.. ..instead of wandering in the mill. Sir, other than the Royal mansion there was another mansion in the city. Imperial Palace. Before India got freedom.. ..the Governor General Ramsay lived in it. Indian revolutionaries were.. ..thirsty for British blood. And one day they attacked Ramsay sir when he was alone. Vande Mataram! And before India achieved freedom.. ..Ramsay's soul was liberated from his body. Ramsay's ghost resided comfortably in the Imperial Palace. But this luxury lasted only for a few days. Because right after the independence.. ..the Indian government sanctioned an order.. ..to convert that place into a library. Now Ramsay liked to read books. But his ghost detested books, magazines and newspapers. So Ramsay was in a dilemma. Mr. Booth! Mr. Booth! And he met his once-upon-a-time boss, Mr. Booth.. ..and made him call Gendamal.. ..and get him a place in the Royal mansion. I've a friend, Ramsay. He just passed away. I need a place for him. Excuse me, are you Raibahadur? Depends who's asking? I am Governor general Ramsay. You are Governor general Ramsay. Than I am Raibahadur Gendamal Hemraj. Mr. Booth has recommended your name. No, Mr. Booth recommended me your name. He was a nice man. He used to called me Genda affectionately. Genda? As in hippopotamus? No, no, that's Gainda Da this is Gentha-tha This is not the same. - Oh, Ganda, meaning dirty. No, it means flower...marigold. Marigold. A lovely name. Shall we go inside? - No. We will not go inside. Who is the boss? I am the boss. Who is the boss? - You're the boss. Yes. So you will not go inside. I will ask you to come inside. Please come inside. May I sir? - Yes. And now we come to the 50's. Gendamal's younger brother, Gulabchand Hemraj. Hemraj family's most useless son. Alcohol, women, gambling, race. You can say he had every bad habit in the world. Complete Casanova. Those days he was madly in love with.. ..the famous singer Manoranjana Kumari.. ..of those days, and also invested lots of money in her films. Manoranjana Kumari? - Yes. She always said. Entertainment. Entertainment. And only entertainment is what makes a film successful. Entertaining the director, producer and actor behind the scenes. And she wouldn't waste a moment.. ..entertaining anyone she liked, Manoranjana Kumari. "I won't give it." "I won't give it." "I won't give my heart for free." "I won't give my heart for free." "Trying to cajole me." "But first check your pockets." "Trying to cajole me." "But first check your pockets." "Check your bank balance first." "And then say I love you." "O beloved, if you don't pay.." "..the taxes for this service, you won't get anything." "I won't give it." "I won't give it." "I won't give it." "I won't give it for free." "I won't give it." "I won't give my heart for free." "I won't give it." "I won't give it." "I won't give my heart for free." "I won't give my heart for free." I am not asking your heart for free, Manoranjana. Did I give you these earrings, the necklace for free? Don't they have a value? Don't they have a price? And I've also transferred the property papers in your name. I don't want your property. All I want is a pinch of vermillion.. ..to grace my forehead. Foolish! I am ready to squander all my wealth at your bellow. And all you demand is a pinch of vermillion. Yes. Make me your wife. And give me some place in your heart. Manoranjana is tired of entertaining people. Take it easy my nightingale. I love you. And I swear I will take the nuptial rounds with you.. ...and marry you ASAP, darling. Thank you. - Mention not. Don't forget me, I beg of you. Will give you, will also give you the bag Gulab didn't keep his promise. And Manoranjana's age.. ..put a full stop on her movie career. And then one day she found out, that.. ..Gulab got married to a famous industrialist's daughter. She couldn't endure her shattered heart.. ..and this terrible shock. And she took to the famous filmy bottle SAD 69. And one day, after finishing 69 bottles.. ..under the influence of alcohol.. ..she hung herself from the fan. Oh no! Manoranjana's soul decided to take refuge.. ..in the same mansion, where she.. ..had dreamt of entering as the daughter-in-law. "My breath severed all ties with life." "My delicate heart shattered like glass." "My heart slowly burns like ember." "My delicate heart shattered like glass." "My delicate heart shattered like glass." "My heart slowly burns like ember." "A sigh comes out of my heart." "My heart slowly burns like ember." "A sigh comes out of my heart." "I've lost everything." "My delicate heart shattered like glass." Sir. Please turn off the lights. Your story is very nice. I mean it's superb. - Thank you, sir. But...the production designing will be really difficult. Different periods. The properties. Costumes. Furniture. We'll have to do detailed research. - No, sir. We don't have to do so much research in a ghost story. You know, I'll shoot Ramsay's scenes in sepia mode. And Manoranjana Kumari's scenes in black and white. Back projection, direct lighting. Every character will have dual shadow.. ..cast on a hand-drawn background of the sky. We can play around with the sky. We can play around with grey-scale. Thank you, sir. You gave such a good reaction on a struggler's story. No one does that, sir. I am touched, sir. I am honored. Thank you, sir. - Control yourself. Now we cut to the 70's. Bombay. Time of the underworld. After Gendamal's death when Gulabchand.. ..tried to take over GH mills, then.. ..Gulabchand uncle, Heerachand.. ..tipped famous gangster Salim Fatela to kill Gulabchand. Coincidentally Salim Fatela.. ..was also a big fan of Manoranjana Kumari. "I won't give it." Gulabchand's ghost wanted to live in Royal mansion too.. ..and apologizes to Manoranjana Kumari. I am sorry, Manoranjana. I made a big mistake. Forgive me. And give me what you always did when you were alive. What? - Your love, Manoranjana. Don't have dirty picture in your mind. Rascal, useless. You came back like a useless coin. Get out of here. Manoranjana, go inside. Sorry, bro. - Get out. Come on, out. Out! - I am sorry. I am sorry. Funny. Very funny. Too funny. Right, sir. And very exciting too. - Right? I'll shoot this killing portion with a hand-reel camera. Like RGV. Sir, RGV? Ram Gopal Verma. - Oh yeah, of course. Sir, I suggest that.. ..you let him shoot the killing scenes. Why not? Actually, he's my guru, you know. - I see. Yes. I've assisted him. I've written dialogues for him. And I even operated the camera in one film. What are you saying? - 5D. Sometimes under the table. Sometimes under the actor's face. And sometimes above the fan's blade.. ..and many other places. Superb, sir. This project is getting very interesting. Thank you, sir. All the characters aren't just.. ..from different socio-economic backgrounds.. ..in fact, they're from different time-period as well. Thank you, sir. And this movie will have an amazing ensemble cast. Thank you, sir. And these days there's an award for this as well. Yes, sir. Bro, continue. Many of the old haunted houses in Mumbai.. ..were being razed down in the name of development. And the ghosts living in them.. ..decided to make Gendamal's mansion.. ..their permanent address and came to them. But it was getting difficult for Gendamal.. ..to adjust and accommodate everyone. So how did the ghosts accommodation problem get solved? Sir, an interview board was formed. This is very loud, get it repaired. And not just from Mumbai, but.. ..ghosts from the different parts of the country.. ..in fact, even from outside the country came from the interview. Don't bend so much. Otherwise you'll hit your head on the ground and break it. There's gas filled in your head. Take this pill and go. Mister, the leaf that you chew is called a 'Paan' (betel-leaf). And my name's Akbar Khwaza Khan.. alias Natwar Khawaza Khan alias Khatwar Khwaza Khan. That's fine, but which one's out of these three is your name? Gentleman, the person's name is Akbar Khwaza Khan. And what's your name? I am Akbar Khwaza Khan. Then what is person's name? Gentleman, this is Urdu dialect. There's just me, there's no us. Oh you mean. You are my mother and you are my father.. you are my friend too. It's an old Hindi film from know you will not understand.. ..but nothing to worry. - Continue In Continue We're Pindari's, mister. Muslim-Maratha are brothers. We fought the battle of Mahirpur. Warrior. - Warrior Akbar. Jodha-Akbar! You movie buff. Not Jodha-Akbar! Warrior Akbar. Talk with respect. Continue. Well, I was king of Indore's Malhar Holkar's special chef. How did you become a ghost? Mister, during the war of Mahirpur.. ..I tried to make a hole in kitchen.. ..and keep an eye on the enemy for the king. But I didn't know that the enemy.. ..already made a hole in the back wall.. ..and have their guns aimed.. ..at the kind's special chef. On the whole what happened? On the whole the enemy filled my whole body with holes.. ..that I didn't know where do I breathe from.. ..and from where do I.. Mister, that's why I hate these Britishers. Is he talking about me? - Yes. He says he likes you. Oh, hello. Mister, the kitchen where I used to live. Now someone's opened a tea-stall there. And now I am kitchen-less. Let's appoint him for making non-veg food. Select. Selected. My name's PK. I was a film producer in Mumbai. You might know that a film producer's life...is really bad. First run after the director for the script. Then run after the hero for dates. Then run after the heroine to dress her up fully. You get so good at running.. ..that, if you make the producer run in the Olympics.. ..then he'll definitely win a gold medal. Sir. Why does he use that word when he speaks? Because the rascal does not deserve to be here. Out! Reject him. - Why, sir? Rejected. What did you do, rascal? - Sorry, sir. Hello, sir. I am Bhootnath Bhaduri. Bhoot.. - Yes. Before the partition I lived in East Bengal. Back there I was a compounder with the doctor. I used to give medicines to the patients. And after the partition I came to Bombay. Mumbai. Mumbai. You're so stupid, brother. There was no Mumbai back then. It was just Bombay back then. So I came to Bombay.. ..and started living close to the railway tracks. It was nice. It was nice. But my life had become terrible. Every day the train pass-by.. ..making the clacking sounds. One day a train passed too close to my ears. I didn't realize. But then someone said "Bengali man passed away". That's when I realized that I am dead. So after that I started living on a tree. Then one day few people came and said.. ..we'll make a highway here, four-lane highway. And they cut down the tree. I lost my home. After that I searched for a home.. ..but, I couldn't find a single home in Mumbai. Bombay. Bombay. He's very stupid. Now it's Mumbai, there's no more Bombay anymore. You see, East Bengal became Bangladesh. Bombay became Mumbai. Humans become devil. But I was a refugee even before I died.. ..and I am a refugee even after I am dead. Nothing happened to me. Your story is very touching. A Compounder that's bit like a doctor Isn't it? I know better. After eating Khwaja Khan's food we might need him. Okay. Accepted. Accepted. Thank you. Thank you, brother. Try this medicine. Take it. Take it. Take this pill. Always works, brother. So fast? - Yes. For the next interview we'll go outdoors. Okay. Oh, God! It is still not working, but this is working. Sir. I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh from Hoshiyarpur.. ..winner of Dharamveer Chakra, sir. Sir! Sir, shall we talk and talk and pass some gas too? - No. I mean pass some time, sir. - Yes. Sir. - Sir. In the year of 1999, the enemy.. ..was showering bullets on us. We had reacquired many parts of Drass and Batalik sector. In the happiness of the victory.. ..our convoy was moving ahead.. ..singing 'Hindustan Hamara', when suddenly. we were shelled. We were bombarded. Sir...sir.. I guess the enemy ghosts are bombarding this place as well. We should be careful. - Relax. We should.. - Relax, there's nobody here. It's just a passing phase. Passing. It's passed. I respect your opinion, sir. But an army man should always be alert, sir. Why? - We attained martyrdom. And even after we died the government scammed our coffins. Why? Because we weren't alert. This is the perfect man to maintain security.. ..for our mansion. - Okay. Hoshiyar Singh. - Yes sir. Situation and breeze, both are quite worse. - I know, sir. But you used your brains, so I select you. I am Aatmaram Paswan. No, you were. Better take the Ram and Paswan out of your name. Now you're just Aatma (spirit). District was Darbhanga. No, it still is. You're dead, but Darbhanga is still alive. What did you do? - Sir, during the day.. ..I used to drive the taxi in Mumbai. And sleep on the footpath at night. One night, just before the new year.. ..I was sleeping covered in my blanket. Suddenly, a rich man, who was very drunk.. ..drove his car onto the footpath. Exactly at the spot where I was sleeping. And right then Aatmaram's soul.. ..was liberated from Aatmaram's body. Right? I don't know, sir. I am a poor man. I have an old model car parked outside. Can you take me to the beach in that? I will take you wherever you want, sir. Fine, fine. Yes, what do you say? This driver does have some drive. - Yes. Accept him. The whiteman said something. Selected. Myself Robin Hooda. Robin Hood? - Not Hood. Hooda. From Rohtak, Haryana. Father was an engineer.. ..so, he wanted me to be an engineer too. And mother was a doctor. She wanted to see me in the operation theatre. But I was interested in music since I was a kid. Rock music. Dodes, Metallica. Anyway, I formed a band. Also released an album. We sold 13 CDs in the market. That's all. Squandered lots of money, also got humiliated. And I also went into depression. I couldn't write songs. The writer in me was blocked. In frustration I started taking drugs. Drugs you mean Aspro, Anacin and Crocin. No. Marijuana, cannabis. Earlier I took small doses. Later I increased the dosage. One day I injected excess heroine. When I came to my senses.. ..I realized that's Robin Hooda lying on the ice-slab. My nose was plugged with cotton. It would be nice to have a musician. - Yes. I believe so. Here at Royal Mansion, we would have.. ..different kinds of musicians visiting us. Really? - Yes. They would come, perform.. ..then eat, and after they ate, I would perform. But whenever I performed they would leave. I don't know why. Selected. You're the boss. Hi, I am Tina. I am.. I am..I am No, no, it's alright. I'm Gendamal Hemraj. Please sit down. Daughter of famous industrialist Pran Chopra. Power-plants, chemical industries, real-estate. My dad used to do every kind of business. You know what, I was a really pampered kid. And on top of that, I loved to party. Heineken was my favorite beer One day I realized that.. ..due to partying and drinking beer.. ..I had gained so much weight. Right then I joined a gym. And that's where I met Sam. Sam? Sam Gonzalvis, my gym instructor. I was totally in love with him. One day my mom-dad found out everything. They tried to bribe me for leaving Sam. But when I didn't agree.. ..they made Sam disappear from Mumbai. I could never forget Sam. I was in love. And I was completely heart-broken. I didn't know what to do. One day I climbed up to the 10th floor.. ..and jumped down. I killed myself. And when I died I saw my parents crying. I felt really, really sad. Accepted. Thanks. After the interview was over.. ..Royal Mansion put up a houseful board. And that night Gendamal.. ..called the selected ghosts in the hall for a welcome drink. My dear late Ladies and Gentlemen. A ghostly welcome to Royal Mansion. Today is a unique day for us. It's unimaginable. Because after today, all of us.. ..will be living under the same roof.. ..which might not have been possible if we were humans. Friends. When we were alive, the fear of death.. ..wouldn't let us live peacefully. But now we're dead. Now we're not scared of death. So come...from today we enjoy our life.. I mean our afterlife. And swear that we couldn't be a good human being. But we will definitely be a good ghost. And we'll make the ghosts of Royal mansion.. ..proud amongst the ghosts in the world. Yes! - Cheers. Tell me one thing. Did all the ghosts settle in Royal Mansion? - Yes, sir. All the ghosts lived here comfortably. Aatmaram. You dead-man. Where are you dying? Hurry up. Start the car. I've to go to Dadar TT. And I've to buy sweets from Damodar's shop. Aatmaram. You're a insult to the ghost society. It's morning and you're still sleeping. I am not sleeping, just straightening my back. Rascal, you're a crooked man that's why you've a crooked back. I don't know. I am a poor man. Rascal. If you're a poor man then sit in the driver's seat. What are you doing at the back? Yes. - And hurry up. Hurry up, I've to get to market soon. Why the market so soon? You fool, look there. In the sky. The sky is this way. Here too. - You're a poor man. So look here. - I see. See, the stars have set and the sun is shining. Now let's go, start the car. The great Indian poor man. But why does he have to buy? He can just extend his hand and steal it. Sir, he's a Bengali ghost after all. Until he doesn't argue and haggle.. ..with the shopkeeper, who will call him... You've done a good study of the Bengali's character traits. Thank you, sir. And thank for this also, sir. Sir, do you like the story? That's why I am also giving you your first installment. Right, sir. So all the shopping was done. Bhootnath returned with fresh sweets and snacks.. ..to express his eternal love to Manoranjana. Stop. Stop. I am stopping. Why are you heading out of the gate again? Now do one thing. Get what's down there. What? Get what's down there. Oh no. No. Get what's down there? - How? Not yours, what's down mine. - What? The bag. Get the shopping bag. It's between my legs. Get it out. - Yes, sir. You might be a poor man, but take bigger steps. Hurry up! Hurry up! How dare you come to the 1st floor in this uniform? I don't know, sir. I am a poor man. I wonder where I get it from. I mean courage. Keep the bags in the kitchen and go down. That's a good idea. Keep it. Bhootnath, you're a high-class Bengali. Why do you entertain such lowly people? You won't tell me who I'll entertain and who I will not. Because you're a double-standard man. You brought that home.. ..for the sake of your Biryanis and Kebabs. Did I say something? - Don't say that. I am telling you.. You fools. You're 21st century ghosts and still talk about classes. Now hear a song. No, no. Stop singing. Stop. I already died once. I don't want to die again hearing your song. I guess he lost his musical sense when he died. - No. My musical sense is intact. But the way you sing, it's not called music. We selected him for this mansion.. ..so that I will get to hear classical music again. But he turned everything un-classical. True. True. Bhootnath. When I was alive, I had a similar.. ..old and grumpy man in my neighborhood. He used to speak nonsense about my music. Once that old man lodged a complaint with the police.. ..to stop my jam session. It's the same situation all over again.. ..even after I am dead. Son, don't sulk. Don't be sad. Do one thing. Start singing folk songs. If you don't know folk, then sing patriotic songs. Like 'Vande Mataram'.. Bhootnath. Bhootnath. I've already prepared a remix version of this song. But I don't want my songs.. ..to be bounded by country borders. Great. Wonderful, Robin. Wonderful. What a dialogue...about music. But...according to me, sing a song for broken heart.. ..which compels me to drink. One can sing about heartbreaks.. ..only after a few pegs. You mean first we down a few pegs and then sing a song. - Right. Then I'll take you to Bhoot Bar today. Bhoot Bar. Tonight's Friday night. There must be gorgeous ghosts visiting today. This is Bhoot Bar. Amazing. It's so nice. I thought she hasn't arrived yet. Go get it. Come on. "..will you drink me? "Intoxication is something you can't let go." "It's like my beloved, you just can't let go." "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "Will I drink you, or will you drink me?" "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "Will I drink you, or will you drink me?" "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "Will I drink you, or will you drink me?" "The bottle... of alcohol's such a rascal." "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "Will I drink you, or will you drink me?" "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "Will I drink you, or will you drink me?" "Take a sip or gulp down the entire bottle." "Forget the world, let's shake the world." "Life's short, let me drink half of it." "Forget all your sorrows, take a peg." "Baby don't cry." "I couldn't find any love, so I picked you." "I hadn't gotten over my first sorrow." "And now I invited another." "I couldn't find any love, so I picked you." "I hadn't gotten over my first sorrow." "And now I invited another." "I couldn't find any love, so I picked you." "I couldn't find any love, so I picked you." "I hadn't gotten over my first sorrow." "And now I invited another." "You're bound to drown in this sorrow." "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "Bottle." "The bottle of alcohol's such a rascal." "The bottle of alcohol's.." "Will I drink you, or will you drink me?" See, sir. It matches to your vision. Matching. Biggest commercial complex in the country, sir. Superb. Find the owner. Guliyani, sir. Yes, Guliyani. Find the owner. But, sir, there's a problem. We builders setup our shop where there's a problem. So Gu, I want this Royal Mansion. At any cost. Get that? - Yes, sir. "Where do we go?" Silence. - Start sound. Rolling. - Camera. Rolling. Clap. Take 7. - Action. Cut. Cut. Cut. Manoranjana. Who are you cutting? I was dreaming. Dreaming? - I am shooting for a film and.. You've crossed the LOC of your life. So I suggest that you.. ..stop dreaming about shootings and films. Whether a film actor leaves her work or the world.. ..but she can never forget those gleaming arc lights. Wow. The camera. The Nagra. The green room. Ice box, spot boy. Food from hero's home. - Wow. Watching your passion for your work.. ..even after you're dead has made me your...deadly fan. Autograph please. I don't sign on currency notes. - Why? When the chairman of the Reserve Bank.. ..has already signed on it, then how can I sign it? Sigh my palm. Pen please. Name please. Hoshiyar Singh. Love to Hoshiyar Singh, Manoranjana Kumari. I will never wash this hand again, even if I've to cut it. You know, in 1965 when I was in Khardunla.. You must be in an epic battle with the enemy. No. I was watching your film. Love can happen anytime. Such a nice title. Love can happen anytime. It can happen now too. "I am such a crazy Jatt." "I am such a crazy Jatt." "Couldn't understand such a simple thing." "That.." Hoshiyar Singh. You're showing your smartness here. And Gaindamal's looking for you. Let's go. - Okay. Okay. Thank you for your autograph. We got introduced. - Hurry up. Come on. "She loves." "She's crazy about me." Sir. You called, sir. Who's the boss? I am the boss. Who's the boss? You're the boss. - The boss didn't call you. Rotate this. Manoranjana, I've seen all your plays. - Plays? No, no, I mean cinema. After watching your first film I fell in love with you. Like they say, love at first night. Love at first sight. I know it's love at first sight. But I saw the night show. So I said love at first night. Oh, God! I guess the old man's lost his mind. I didn't hear anything. I was a big fan of your since I was just a kid. You know, I also made a fan club for you. And in that club we all addressed you as Ma. Not as in mother. By Ma we meant Goddess. Bhootnath, the movie world is a bad place. My Guru used to say.. ..that you can stay in this glittering world.. ..only as long as you stay beautiful. Once your beauty disappears.. ..you will disappear. How could your Guru say that? Beauty is not a pot of tea.. ..that when the tea's over, the pot's broken. Manoranjana, your time will never be up. Because you were beautiful, you still are.. ..and forever will be. There's no point in praising me now, Bhootnath. It's very late now. - I understand. But Manoranjana, everyone's late here. I am late Bhootnath Bhaduri. You're late Manoranjana Kumari. But before it's too late. Sweets and snacks for you. Bhootnath, this isn't time for sweets. Yes, I understand. I understand. I get it. This is time for something else. But Manoranjana, I want to say something. Like all men, you'll say.. ..Manoranjana, I love you a lot. I am fed up of hearing this dialogue. Why will I say that? I will say what I want. And I want to hear you sing. What? Shameless. Aren't you ashamed? I'll show you. Anybody there. Anybody there. Manoranjana. I meant song. Singing. "Open your door." "I am standing at your threshold." "Don't let me standout anymore." Who's there? Who's bothering you? Manoranjana, my love.. ..this Bhootnath's after you again. But don't be scared. This is Muslim-Maratha, Khwaja Akbar Khan.. ..chef of king Malhar Holkar speaking. I will teach him a lesson. You rascal, you will teach me a lesson. A soldier without a shield and sword and come here holding a rose. Mind your tongue, Bhootnath. Oh, God! What's going on? Accept this lover's true love and take this rose.. ..and I'll personally cook for you Kebabs. And then you'll suffer from loose motions. Enemy of my love, be alert. If you have Urdu poems then I've Bengal Tigers. I won't be scared. You won't be scared? - No. Then you will be killed by me. Come on. - I see. I will die. You will kill me? Rascal, how will you kill me? How will you kill me? - Don't provoke me. Will you kill me with the plastic rose? There goes your plastic rose. What the.. What's up, sister? You've hit the jackpot. One rose and three admirers. Oh my, God! How will I handle three lovers? Three. I'm experienced at handling 30, Tina. But these are old men, and they're all dead. But there's a nice boy for you here. He's single, and also ready to mingle. If I would be at your place I would've taken him on a long-drive.. ..and eaten dinner with him. You smoke so much? Haven't you heard? Smoking is injurious to health. Sweetheart, when there's no health then what's it injurious to? Whatever it is, it's really bad. It's stinking man. Tell me, when did you start singing? When I was born. But when a child is born he cries. I was singing. But you know, people like love, romantic music.. ..more than what you sing. To hell with it. I've forsaken romance and romantic music from my system. I don't let flowers, mountains, river, waterfalls, love.. ..anywhere close to my music. I don't sing from the mouth I sing from my entire body. A song that has passion, openness, liberty. That means you will never sing romantic songs? Never. - But why? Do you want to know the answer? "I am scared of being betrayed." "My heart be filled with pain." "I am scared of being betrayed." "My heart be filled with pain." "The thought of it makes me sweat." "The thought of it makes me sweat." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Any boy who falls in love with his neighbor." "Any boy who falls in love with his neighbor." "You can bet that.." "..he'll be fixing tents in her marriage." "It's a constant threat to life." "It's a constant threat to life." "It's a constant threat to life." "It's a constant threat to life." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's a butcher, it ruins a man." "Love's a butcher, it ruins a man." "It makes your market value zero in a minute." "Life will be worse than death." "Life will be worse than death." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." "Love's such a rascal." This is Haryanvi rock. Wow. Simply superb. Thank you, sir. Thank you. This is a complete insanity ambiance. No, sir, hauntedness. - What? Hauntedness? Nice one. So all the ghosts were spending their days.. ..with love and affection. But one day suddenly a problem came up. Problem? For the ghosts? I had heard that ghosts trouble people. Yes, sir. But the situation was different here. The people were troubling the ghosts. They've turned Royal Mansion into a vegetable market. They're hammering a nail on every wall. Someone's taking a nap. Someone throwing used plates. And someone's spitting. And they've setup a rail-track on the floor.. ..and people are getting on and off that thing. That means they have no civic sense. And the heroine has filled my room with smoke from her cigarette. I was a film actress too. But even I never smoked so many cigarettes. And she's showing such attitude. Let's lodge a report at the police station. Who will lodge a ghost's report? And anyway, they already bribe the police at first. Then we'll have to use our special power. What's that? Let's scare them away. Sister, I feel you should teach that heroine a lesson first. Fine. All the film actresses are nervous before the shot. I'll scare her so badly.. ..that she'll never act again in her life. Scene 1, take 1. And action. She fell down, the shooting was cancelled. Mid Day and Mirror covered the story on their front page. And slowly the news, that GH Mills and Royal Mansion.. ..are haunted, spread in the entire film industry. Producers and directors stopped filming here. The ghosts of Royal Mansion won.. ..and it was celebration time. And on this joyous occasion.. ..Gaindamal decided to take all the ghosts out for a picnic. "Here come the care fee ghosts." "Care free ghosts." "Care free ghosts." It feels so strange, right? We ghosts are out on the beach to party.. ..and have a blast. Bhootnath, we ghosts have the right to have fun. The biggest advantage of being a ghost is.. ..we don't need any visa or passport. We can go anywhere, any place, any time and anyway we want. Right, Aatmaram? - I don't know, sir. I am a poor man. You lost with 15 - Love. I've already lost. But I really liked one thing today, Robin. What? My game? No, I heard you say 'love' 15 times today. "Mister, walk slowly." "Be careful in love." Very nice. The oil is wonderful. Hey mister, this isn't the oil.. ..it's the magic of my hands. Once I make any vegetable.. ..whether it's a Bengali or a Bihari he can't stop licking his hands. Khwaja, tell me one thing. Did you forsake the sword and take up the ladle.. ..or forsake the ladle and take up the sword? Insolent, audacious fool. How dare you joke with me? Sorry. Sorry. I was only pulling your string. I was joking.. But I'll be honest with you. You really cook well. - Thank you, mister. Not the food, you bore me too much. With your hideous poems. Why you.. You pollute the place where you eat. Brother, can I sit here? Sitting. - No, no. It's sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Brother, you love eating. You talk to a Bengali about eating. A Bengali eats so much.. ..that he squanders his entire money on eating. That's why the food's tasty but not nutritious. We eat for taste, not to wrestle. What food do you get in Mumbai? 'Bhelpuri, Sevpuri, Panipuri, Madam Puri, Amrish Puri.' It seems like the surname of the entire Puri family. There's only 'Jhol' (curry) in Bengali food. 'Fish curry, potato curry. Curry, curry and more curry. No, brother. Before pointing finger at a Bengali take a peak in your own wok. What do you have in Mumbai's wok? Except for the 'Puri' family just a dry 'Vada pav' (Fritter). Hey! Vada Pav is the pride of Mumbai. 'Bhelpuri, Sevpuri, Panipuri..' ..are the symbol of our unity. And a person from every community eats it. And Mumbai has a specialty. Here a person gets up on a empty stomach.. ..but never sleeps hungry. And the credit goes to 'Bhelpuri, Sevpuri, Panipuri and Vada Pav.' Scoundrel refugee. You lived, slept and woke up in Mumbai. But didn't you feel hurt while insulting Vada Pav. From today you're out of the Royal Mansion. Out! - Out! I was only having a discussion. And it's important for a Bengali to win every discussion. Fine, I admit I lost this discussion. Okay. Come on, say sorry. Now. - Who's the boss? I am the boss. Who's the boss? You're the boss. - Now say sorry. Sorry. - Say sorry. Say sorry. - Sorry. Say sorry sister. - I won't say it. I will say sorry but I won't call her sister. It's a wonderful situation for an argument. Robin would've made a nice song on this situation. But where is Robin? You girls are crazy. Love, love, in everything you want to get love. Don't you have anything else to do? What is your problem? Why do you hate girls? Did someone ditch you? - One? If I start counting you'll be jealous. All girls are crazy about money. - Wrong. There are some girls who are crazy about love. The example is right before you. Yes. You don't even mention the name.. ..for the one you jumped from the 10th floor. Instead you try to flirt with me. Oh... Tina, what happened? What happened? Why should I take that greedy, cheater's name? He first cheated me and then killed me. He did what your father said. What could he do? I lied. After I died I found out.. Oh ! ..that Sam was never shifted out of Mumbai. In fact, he asked for a big money from my dad to leave me and Mumbai. And after taking the money he went to Australia. He completely forgot me. He never loved me. Sorry, Tina. I am really sorry. Forget it. Give me a smile. Smile. Tina. Tina, listen. Tina, you always say why do I sing meaningless songs. I'll sing a romantic-sweet song for you today. But on one condition. Before I sing you will have to smile. Now smile. "Its love that I see in my beloved's eye." "I know you're restless.." "..to cajole Hooda." "My confused heart's finally at peace." "O dark glasses, what's your scene." "O long tresses, what's your scene." "What's your scene?" "What's your scene?" "Don't waste our time." "Tell us clearly who do you want?" "My throat's dry." "Get me my favorite booze." "My throat's dry." "Get me my favorite booze." "SAD 69, o beloved." "My throat's dry." "You dwell in my heartbeats." "I've brought what you drink day and night." "Drink until you're knocked out." "And come in my arms." "Father's in the courtyard.." "..and your lovers at the threshold." "How do I get in your house?" "Father's in the courtyard.." "..and your lovers at the threshold." "How do I get in your house?" "How do I get in your house?" "My father's gone away." "And my lover's are hanging." "My father's gone away." "And my lover's are hanging." "Now pack your bags and run to Bihar." "Now pack your bags and run to Bihar." "The heart's said to your heart." "I am in love with you." "The heart's said to your heart." "The heart's said to your heart." "I am in love with you." "I am in love with you." "My friend just chill." "Come and fill my empty life." "Be just as crazy as I am." "Understand my dilemma." "And fall in love with me." "We're the best." "We're the best." "The ghosts of Royal Mansion." "The ghosts of Royal Mansion." "We're each other's friends." "We have no.." "We have no host." "We're filled with joy, let's have toast." "We're the best." "We're the best." "The ghosts of Royal Mansion." "We're each other's friends." Stop it! What happened? I was dancing. What do you want? Hold on. Sir, Royal Mansion's in trouble. What? What are you saying? - Yes. We were living there peacefully until now.. ..because your property was disputed. - Yes. But the dispute is over. - So? Your great grandsons have joined hands. They have agreed on out-of-the-court settlement.. ..and they're selling the mansion and mill. What? What are you saying? - Yes, sir, it's true. They will raze everything down and build a mall. Mall. You know all my male fans used to call me a 'Maal' (hottie). You're still one, sweetheart. Manoranjana! Oh, God! This is devastating news. If anything happens to the Royal Mansion.. ..then I'll be homeless again. If this had been the British rule.. ..I would've hanged this man to his death. Soldiers, we will give our life, boss. But we will protect the mansion. Idiot, you're already dead how can you die again? Let's first find out who's the buyer. - Yes. I think she has a point. Who is this buyer? Some builder called Bhooteriya. Who told you? - Technology. I installed surveillance cameras outside Royal Mansion. Cameras? And I just received a MMS from that. MMS. - MMS. - See. See. That's Royal Mansion. See. See. Who's getting down from the car? He's Bhooteriya. He looks like a villain. Yes, Manoranjana. Suresh bhai, thank you. Ramesh bhai, congratulations. Bhooteriya sir, all yours. See, Guliyani. When Bhooteriya sets his eyes on something.. Yes! - ..he always gets it. Yes! Now watch what I do with this place. I will give it a complete makeover. But sir, what will you build here? I'll build a 5 floor mall. I've also thought of a name. Bhooteriya 5 Star Plaza. Oh my god. What's this? - It's run out of battery. We'll go home and recharge it. Let's go to Royal Mansion. Follow me. - Cadets. Comrades.. lets go. Oh, God. Look. Cheers. Everything has been settled, no problem. Cheers. Look at him. After giving us pain they're drinking champagne. We'll have to do something. There's just one problem, Mr Bhooteriya sir. Heritage site status. - No, sir. There are two problems, sir. One is heritage site. And second is... very big Quiet. Ghost. Stop stammering. Go. Ask the architect to start work. - Yes. Tell him to make the best construction. Mumbai will turn into Shanghai later. We'll build our own mini Shanghai first. Stop! What the... You're talking about building Shanghai.. ..and the Municipality doesn't have a clue. So you're from the Municipality. - No. The Municipality is in my pocket. Come here. - Me? Me... come here. Ma..ka..rand. - Hey! Not Ma..kha..rand That's Makhrand Marathe. Maharashtrian. The chief of Makad Company. Get that? - Yes. Makad means? - Makad means monkey. Ok. I was overhearing your conversation quietly like a monkey. Is there a problem with the heritage status? No, no, no... Say it. There's no problem. All your problems will be solved. It's the rule of the world. Give and take. In the language of Makad company you give and I take. Name your price. 20... Lakh. Quiet! Look. 20 means 20 percent. 20 percent? Too much. Don't try to be too difficult. Otherwise it will take just one bullet to kill you. You have just one week. Get me my 20 percent and build your mall. Makad's, let's go. Guys, there's a twist in the story. Political twist. - There's not twist. He's a rich man. He'll pay the 20 percent. The politician will get what he wants and we'll be homeless. He won't be convinced so easily. He's a businessman. He'll negotiate till the end. That means we have some time.. ..and a window of opportunity. But until then we can't just sit idle. Revolt. Bloodbath. Charge. No point in screaming and yelling. Think of an idea, Bhootnath. - Yes. I am thinking to over feed him the Bengali sweets.. ..and he'll get high blood sugar. And he'll die of diabetes. That's a stupid idea. Aatmaram, what do you say? What can I say, sir? I am a poor man. Robin, how about you? I feel we should give him a sound thrashing. You can't even play your guitar properly. How will you give him a sound thrashing? I'll play the guitar. - Quiet. Can I say something? - Yes. In the year 1857.. Oh no, Not again. Common yaar. Oh god, Again! Silence. It's important, you will have to hear it. combat, battle, struggle and War. The first stage is always intelligence gathering. When you find out your enemy's strength.. ..and weaknesses, you've won half the war. Then who will win half the war? This shorty. I am Khwaja Akbar. Alias Khwaja Akbar.. I've decided that I will go to the builder. I will spy on him. And I will find his weakness. By selling him pills? - Not pills. I'll floor him with my acting. I've done many plays. French, Romans, Countrymen. Ceaser You bloody fool. How dare you talk about acting in front of Manoranjana? I was always casted without the couch. - Idea. What? Say it. To make our mission successful.. ..we need a cunning actor like Manoranjana. Cunning actress? - I mean successful actress. Thank you. - So Manoranjana, get ready for the mission.. Mission Bhooteriya. "Here comes the carefree ghosts." 200 shops on 1 floor.. ..which means 1000 shops on 5 floors. 1 crore for 1 shop. 1000 shops... 1000...crores. "Carefree ghosts." "Carefree ghosts." Bhooteriya the king. Come in. "I won't give it." "I won't give it." "I won't give it." Hi, I am Bhavna. Bhooteriya. Nice to touch you. But without appointment in my office.. If I had taken an appointment then I would've been disappointed. Good. Good. You did the right thing. You did the right thing. What are you playing? - Golf. Will you play? - Will you teach me? Golf? Sure. Sure. Come, come. Hold. Hold. Now teach me. - Yes. In golf, the stick should be hard and a good aim. So that the ball goes directly in the hole. Like this. Mr. Bhooteriya, yes! I need a favor from you. Flavor? What flavor? "I won't give it." I want a space in your 5 star Plaza. But who told you about it? We haven't even started this project? It's confidential. I've hid it from everyone. Don't worry, even I believe in hiding. Mr. Bhooteriya. Mr. Bhooteriya. - Yes. I've lost my key. Please find it. - Yes, sure, sure. Why not? It's not.. Do you see it? I am trying. Found it. Found it? - Thank you. Thank you so much. Will you give me space? I will. As much as you want. - You are so sweet. Oh no. - What happened? See, in a hurry I brought my car keys.. ..but I forgot to bring my car . How will I go back? Only if I let you go. - Really? Yes. Now will you really give me space? But what will you give me in return? Everything. Head massage. Shoulder massage. Body massage. Full sensation. I will touch your strong points. I hope you don't have a weak point. My wife. Are you scared of her? Yes. I was scared of her when she was alive. Now that she's dead, I am still scared. She's dead? Yes. That's why she haunts me every night in my dreams. What happened to her? - Nothing happened. I killed her. What? - I burnt her alive. Why? She nagged me all the time. I had a chick. Beautiful chick. We were having an affair. When Lakshmi found out she was jealous. I thought...let's get her out of the way forever. Then? - Then what? One day when she set out in her BMW.. ..I poured petrol on the car, and set it ablaze. I miss her. The wife? No, the BMW. It was worth 65 lakhs. Actually, Lakshmi's my weakness, Bhavna. She doesn't let me sleep all night. People are right. Men become ghosts after they die. But women are always a witch. "I won't give it." - Bhavna. "I won't give it." Bhavna. So even though Manoranjana was dead.. ..she still entertained Bhooteriya. Yes. But only to know his secret. But this Bhooteriya seems like a dangerous man. Exactly, sir. And so, the ghosts of Royal Mansion needs.. ..someone more dangerous than Bhooteriya to teach him a lesson. But where will we find such a man? On Spookbook. Spookbook? - Yes! It's a social networking site for all the ghosts. We'll definitely find someone here. And their slogan is... "Ghost. Let's strengthen relationships". And they found the man they were looking for. He lost an arm when he was kid while making a local bomb. And since them people started calling him Babu Hathkata.

Now I will burn you alive. You will suffer to death. No, Lakshmi. Don't forget I am your husband. Your husband. Husband. Babu bhai, please save me. Don't try to be too difficult. Just die quietly. Get that. Babu bhai, I made a mistake. Forgive me. Keep the money. I'll send you 20 Cr. more. Let me go. Here you go. I'll pour alcohol on his body.. ..and you set his body on fire. Stop, Lakshmi. Let him go. Let him go? Why? You know what he did with me. He's the reason why my soul's wandering around. Don't worry, Lakshmi. I will support your wandering soul. And if he doesn't, then I will.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Hey, smarty? Do you think we're dumb? Keep the bag down. - Yes. And send the other 20 which you just said. Now get lost. - Wait Mr. Bhooteriya You can't go like that. Who is the boss? I am the boss. Who is the boss? You are the boss. - Yes. So you'll be pardoned only after hearing the boss. Mr. Ramsay, play the music please. Yes, sir. - Thank you. Friends. Ghosts. Human being. You know...their shopping malls, multiplexes.. ..housing complexes, high-rise towers.. ..have deprived the poor of the sun. Because of them, the sky's getting smaller.. ..for the children to fly their kites. With the pointed edges of their towers.. ..they are piercing the heart of the skies. That's when it doesn't rain, it doesn't rain. And when it does, it wreaks havoc. There was a time when there were huge homes in the city. With huge courtyards, lawns. But today...the common man makes many sacrifices.. ..and pays EMI and what does he get in return. A small pigeon coop. By stealing each foot, they're.. ..pulling the earth from below the poor. They have left no place for a grave either. Graves are getting smaller.. ..that a person feels suffocated even after he's dead. Move aside. I feel suffocated. Move. Forget humans. They've even made the lives of ghosts difficult. How have we harmed you.. ..that you want to snatch our peace and serenity. Only to fill your banks with more money.. ..why are you throwing us out of our homes? Without thinking where we'll go, where we'll stay. In dustbins, the public toilet. Or in one of the trial rooms in your mall. If you keep constructing these buildings.. ..then one day the earth will cave in.. ..under the burden of the iron, metal and bricks. The world was scared of ghosts. But now ghosts are scared of these real-estate demons. So tell me who do we complain to? Who do we talk to? No. You cannot understand our pain. You're human after all. And humans these days.. ..don't understand another human's pain.. ..so how can they understand a ghost's pain? Go. Go away from here. Leave us to our condition. Take him away. Go. Son, you're fortunate. Now get out of here. No mercy, or apology. One blow is enough. Let's go. Get out. Run away. Get out. Aatmaram, will you take me home? - Of course, sir. I am a driver. And a good driver picks his guest from his home.. ..and also takes him back. What a nice thing to say? Are you a ghost too? - I don't know, sir. I am a poor man. Very, very interesting. Thank you thank you. I didn't get one thing. - Yes. How did the ghosts find Lakshmi? Spookbook. What? Spookbook? Yes, just like Facebook.. ..ghosts have Spookbook. - Nice. Bizarre Boss. Lakshmi accepted Tina's request. And also her offer to teach Bhooteriya a lesson. But sir, the main problem was doing a hot item number. Because Lakshmi was a simple, homely lady. She didn't know how to dance. Got it, Manoranjana Kumari. And Tina, sir. They both trained her. - What a concept. What a concept. - Thank you, sir. And these ghosts taught a nice lesson to Bhooteriya. I guess he never cast an eye on Royal Mansion again. No, sir, he came back. In fact the next day? With a witch doctor? With the original papers of Royal Mansion. Bhooteriya transferred the property back to the ghosts forever. And once again there was happiness in Royal Mansion. And on this joyous occasion.. ..Gaindamal allowed Gulabchand.. ..in Royal Mansion as well. And Manoranjana Kumari and Gulabchand were together again. What a story. - Sir. Sir. What a story. - Thank you, sir. It's got characters, plot points, cinematic moments. Crises, and now I've the resolution as well. And a hot item number too. Raju writer, you really are a writer. Thank you, sir. Thank you. I like it. My friend! I like it very much. But brother, you see... ..our story is very nice. Not just nice, it's sensational. But there's a small hurdle. Hurdle? - Not too much. Our story's a bit whacky. It's a bit weird. So the producer might hesitate a bit to invest in this idea. But I will manage. I'll do it. Not to worry. Sir, is that all? - Yes, that's it. What's this? - See it yourself, you'll understand. These are coins during the East India Company rule. They must be really old, antique. Not just antique, sir. They are worth a fortune. Enough for you to start your film. Keep it. We'll arrange for the rest too. - Hold on. First you tell me your story. After that you also arrange for the finance. What do you want? Sir, I want to see a film being made on my script. Sir, since I grew conscious, I had just one dream. Someday I'll be a film writer. And someone will make a film on my story. With this dream and 400 rupees.. ..I came to Mumbai from Allahabad. Fought with my mother and angered my brother. I was worried as well. But I was confident. I knew that someday my dream will come true. Slowly my dreams started shattering.. ..and so did my faith. Everywhere I went with my story.. ..all I would get is rejection. Everyone said "Raju, forsake this profession". You will only face failure. But, sir, I had heard a line in a play. If a man has to be a failure.. ..then it should be in the work he wants to do. You're successful now. I am making a film on your story. I am happy that I got success at least after I died. What? After I died? Sir, five months ago I had no work.. ..so I used to do ghost-writing for many writers. One day I was returning home.. ..after finishing work. And its raining heavily. And I suddenly heard a girl screaming. Save me! Save me! Come on. Come. Who are you? Come on. Run! Run! Go. Run! Kill him.. Kill him. And that is how I got killed. I couldn't become a writer.. ..but I definitely became a ghost. After I became a ghost I came to Royal Mansion. Gaindamal sir gave me permission to stay here.. ..as a special case. Then one day I wrote a story.. ..about the joys, sorrows and the sufferings of the ghosts.. ..which I just narrated to you. I must say you should start acting. You should stop writing. That is how I got killed, sir. You think I am joking. I don't think. I know. You're pulling my leg. What's the proof? You want proof? Yes, I do. - Come. You want proof, don't you? Curtain call, please. Yes, Sumit. Sorry, I fell asleep. Very sorry. You fell asleep, but I am in a mess. I had to travel in a truck the whole day. I guess I'll have to give it a massage. Let's go. - Wait. I just found out how beneficial sleeping is. How? I heard a film story in my dream. Almost a script. Do one thing, go the Guinness Book of World Records. They will definitely produce your film. After all, this will be the first film.. ..which was written in the dream. Give me a drag. - Yes, sure. What's this? Aditya. Number 1, take 1. Clap. And action. Trolley. "Here comes... the carefree ghost." "Dance to the tunes of movie songs, sweetheart." "Here comes...the carefree ghost." "Dance to the tunes of movie songs, sweetheart."
