Somebody, Please help me! Help me! Somebody.. Help me, please! -Jesus. - He's right behind me. Please. - You're safe. Amber, right? Amber Ryder? All units. All units. This is Doyle. 10-99 on Begos Road near the hospital. I got her. Send medical. - No, no, no, we have to get out of here. He's gonna kill me. -Amber, listen. Everyone's been out looking for you. The whole area is on lockdown and he knows it. Now someone will be by here in a minute to take you out of here and then we'll get him. I promise. I'm gonna get a blanket from the trunk and.. -It's okay. -Okay, Henry. Okay. On from here walking Dreams awake I think not I think not The sky comes king Blown in every direction And of no country I am straw It is no mystery I know my way from here Iron sharpens iron Crooked wooden in peacock black I have your feathers Slung across my back I'm not the only one To help you down the hill My blue knuckles Do as they will It is no mystery I know my way from here It is no mystery I know my way from here -Yeah. I'll tell him, but.. Yeah, I understand that, Lu, but you know what he'll say. Okay, lieutenant. - No. - Matt. - No, Darcy. - I told him you'd say that. - Then why the hell are we still having this conversation? - So I can follow a direct order and tell the lieutenant I relayed his message. -Fine. Go ahead. -It is CNN this time. They are asking for five minutes, Matt. -We good? - You know, it might be good to talk to them. - Christ, not again. - No, not for you. The victims. - The families deserve to hear more than dry line items of the case reports. - It's over, Darcy. He's dead. If they can't accept that... - No, no, no, it's not about accepting it. They wanna understand. -Understand? What more is there to understand? He was random and vicious. The Garrets want to understand? The Masons, they want to understand? Do the Thompsons really want to understand exactly what was going through Henry's mind as he snatched up their little girl up and whipped her to death with the chain off her bicycle? - Jesus, Matt. I'm not asking you to rationalize it for them. - A lot of kids get knocked around by their old man. The problem is how some of them choose to deal with it. - It's also a problem when they choose not to deal with it. -It's late. -Hey. - Please tell me we're not still talking about this. There's nothing new. -Yeah, well.. Must have been Henry's. -Can I help you? - You have something that don't belong to you, detective. - Wait, I know you, from Henry's file. You're that Degraty woman... -DeGracie, Della DeGracie. The one who found Henry the night his father died... -The night. And I have to have back that item. Henry had a box. - Look, lady, it's been a long day, alright. Anything of Henry's has to be filed with the police clerk. You can come down to the station tomorrow we'll see what we can do. -Mom, I'm done. Come look. - Okay, baby. Are your shoes on? - Yeah. - Okay, because mine are not. I can't find them, have you seen my brown sandals? - Mom? - Okay, okay, sorry. -Let me see. Oh, so pretty. Nice job. Okay, get ready. Here, we gotta get going, okay? Uh, Buddy, get down. Sweetheart, we talked about this when we moved in. There is no reason for you to be afraid of Buddy. He would never hurt you, I promise. Okay? - It's daddy! - What? Great. -There is my girl! -I'm gonna keep you, daddy. - And I'm gonna keep you. - Forever? - Forever and ever. - Look what I made. -Whoa, that is beautiful. - I know. Do you have anything for me? -It's in the car, sweetheart. - Jesus, Matt. We've been through this. You can't just show up here. -I needed to see her. -I saw the news. - You got him, huh? - I got him. - You alright? You seem... - I'm fine. -Of course you are. Well, good for you. - The shoes you were looking for, they were, um.. -Thank you. -Hey, Matt. -Ethan. - Come on, I'll be in the car, okay? - Come on, Chloe, let's get in the car. Take care of yourself, Matt. - There's my favorite girls. Hi. -Hey, kiddo. - What's up, Toddy? You know I have a dolly, right? - Nope. Did not get that information. - So, you're helping us out today? - Yeah, I'm making some stuff, too. - Yeah? Well, you better save something for me. - Uh, guys. Still heavy. - Oh, alright just take it in the back, babe. - Let's go, squirt. Grab the door. - You guys good? - Yeah. Todd keeps having nightmares. We're still living in the one-bedroom shithole he grew up in. So he's not sleeping very well. -I'm sorry. What about the interview from the other day? - We're still waiting to hear back. God, he's been out of work for... six months now. -I'm sorry. -It's really killing him. I don't know how we're staying afloat. Which by the way, thank you for.. The extra hours and stuff. Really appreciate it. - Hey, don't even. I wish, I could do more. He's gonna find something. Something great. -We'll see. I was happy to get him out of the house. -Oh, yeah. - Congratulations on Bale, detective. -Thank you. -Mommy, it's cold in this. -Great, honey. - Oh, my God, these are so cool. -That's my daughter, Chloe. She's a jewelry designer. And I think she is having a sale. Two dollars? - Got a sweatshop goin', huh? - Obviously. -Do you have this in a set? -I'm sorry, just the one. -That's a shame. Your father would like one for his study. - I can make some calls and see if I can find... -No, that... that's okay. - Listen, give me your name and email I'll let you know when we get more like that. Okay? - Thank you. - Of course. -There you go. -I'll take one. Alright. How's that look, Chloe? - Chloe-bear, you've got a customer. Chloe? Baby, where did you get those things? Chloe? It's okay, baby. It's okay. -What happened, seizure? - It's okay, baby, just... Just listen to mommy's voice. Remember, it'll go away. - Hey, Chloe, did you make these? This is so cool. Can I buy it from you? Yeah? - Bye. - Feel better. -Chloe, you're a hit. -That was a tough one. - Hey, can you go solo for a bit? - I'm gonna take her home. - Yeah, yeah, of course. -Go home, baby? - Forgotten how ugly that wall was. You okay? - My father would have been 72 today. - You still taking Chloe to Disneyworld? Happiest place on earth. You think you can handle it? - It was supposed to be Amy, too. Three years ago, I said, after I catch this guy.. We can.. Whatever. I never.. Told you this 'cause I was too ashamed. The day we found Tyler Richardson's body Amy made me promise to come home early. Well, we found Tyler.. I forgot all about it. Got home around 2 AM walked in, Amy and Chloe are asleep on the couch. "Happy Birthday, Chloe Bear" banner on the mantle. Presents and cake.. I remember this bastard's birthday every year. I forgot my own daughter's. Anyway. Amy woke up when I walked in. We just stared at each other. Neither one of us said anything. Guess that's when we knew it was over. God, I fucked it up. -Yeah, you did. -Here, really? -Just do it. - Wouldn't you feel more comfortable buying this? - Hey, I've gotta do the hard part. -Are you sure? -I'm three weeks late. What is it, babe? -It's a lot to take in. -It's gonna be okay. -That'll be $9.94. Son? $9.94. Cash or charge, son? Hey, are you alright? -Mom, can I have my blanket? -Of course. -I miss daddy. -Come on, Buddy. -There you go. -What's wrong, mommy? -Nothing, baby. Hey, do you know who became a professional jewelry designer today? You did. When you sell something, that makes you a professional. I am so proud of you. You know, Aunt Becca says she's gonna wear hers every day. You know, maybe you and I should be business partners. -Can I be the boss? -Yes, you can be the boss. And guess what? I have a present for you. Guess who bought the very last Chloe William's original today? -I wanna wear it. - Not while you are sleeping, baby. It's dangerous. Sorry. I have an idea. Give me your wrist. Mm-hmm. I love you, baby. -I love you. - Sweet dreams. -Hey, over here. - You gonna tell me why we're suddenly on top of the batting order again? This isn't our case, Darce. -Just watch. The kid's name is Conner Heffler. And the clerk's Tommy Logan. Kid goes off camera for a second to get a pregnancy test for his girlfriend who is waiting in the car. -And where's she at now? - I had a uniform take her back to the station. He goes to pay.. -Why, he tweaking? - Running a tox screen now. Girlfriend came up clean. Same as the car. Swears Heffler was, too. -Jesus. Fuck. You gonna tell me what this has to do with me? -Just look. Comes the store owner. That's... This has to do with you. How the hell did that kid do that? Henry's calling card wasn't public record. It was redacted from all reports, all photos specifically so some nut job doesn't go out and play copycat. -Where there's a will.. - So what is he, just some highly resourceful psycho kid lookin' to go out in the spotlight? - Probably. - Bullshit. -You don't believe that. If you did, you wouldn't be here. You'd be off doing whatever it is you do these days 'cause I've stopped trying to figure it out. - What the hell do you want from me? -I want you to say it. Tell me the first thing that came into your mind when you saw what that kid drew in there. Oh, come on, Matt. The brutality of that attack, the rage. That and the mark. You're really gonna tell me that's just some half-ass interpretation of Henry's MO? Why are you still standing here? -Because it was perfect. -What was that? She's not in here! - Alright, I'm gonna check the other room. -Chloe? I can't find her. - She's not in this room either. -Chloe! God, where is she? -Oh, my God. -Where is Chloe? Chloe. -Hey, hey, Amy, Amy. -Oh, my God. Chloe? Are you in here? - Chloe? - Honey? -Chloe! Oh, my God. I'm calling an ambulance. - What have we got? - Juvenile female, eight years old hypertensive, unresponsive. Respiration erratic. She's an epileptic. - Then? Mother reports a regular course of Topamax. 150 milligrams. Last dose 7 PM. -Area 1 is open. - Oh, wait. You guys can't go in. She's in really good hands. I promise to let you know something as soon as I possibly can, alright? - Why don't you come over here? There is room to wait. Okay? - We'll be fine. That's okay. -Ms. Bayer? Trisha? I'm Detective Williams. Matt. Believe me, we wanna find out why this happened as bad as you, so... Is it okay if I ask you a couple of questions? You and Conner aren't from here. Why were you in town? -School's out. Driving home to Florida, Pensacola. Stopped on our way through. - School is where? - Iowa. -Hawkeyes? You and Connor ever take any drugs? -No. Conner never... And I'm pregnant. I mean, I think I am. That's why Conner, he went into the store. - It's okay. Have some water. How did Conner know the store clerk? -He didn't. - Trisha, the way he attacked that man there had to be something personal. -No. Never. We've never even been here before. - Have you ever heard the name Henry Leonard Bale? -The serial killer? - Is it possible Conner would had contact with him? -What? No! Of course, not. Never. - Maybe followed the case? Took a special interest? -No. Not at all. Why? - Have you ever seen this symbol before? -What is that? What is that? Oh, my God. - This officer is gonna take really good care of you. - You didn't have to show her the picture. -Nope. - You just wanted to see her reaction. -Yeah. -She doesn't know shit. -Nope. Where is she? -They sedated her. - I don't understand. The... the dog? I wanna see her. -She's in there. -I should leave. - Ethan. - No, he's her father. - And you're my fiancee. Stay with me. - Hello, detective. I'm Dr. Wells. - What is this? - We don't know yet. - She's an eight-year-old girl for Christ's sakes. Did you hear what she did? -I can't explain that. -What can you explain? - The blood we took shows extremely elevated stress hormone levels consistent with an epileptic seizure. - She's had seizures before. Nothing like this. - The nature of seizures is unpredictable, detective. Especially in children. Now, you said she had another intense episode earlier today? - Yeah. - What? - It was over in a minute. Like always. I handled it. She was fine. You wanna talk about how many times I've had to handle this on my own in the last couple of years? - Hey. Nobody did anything wrong. What's important is that we're taking care of her now. -What's next? - Well, the standard protocols have failed to lower her pulse or her blood pressure as much as I'd like to see. But she'll level out. The best thing is to keep her sedated and let her get a rest. -Thank you, doctor. -Ethan. I can't bring her back to the house like that. - No, no, I'll take care of it. -I am so sorry. - I'll be back as soon as I can. It's okay. -It's okay, baby. Daddy's here. -Hey. It's gonna go great. They wouldn't have called you again if they didn't want you. - I'll believe that when they offer me the job. - And then we'll have a celebration dinner. -Hopefully. -It's a good luck charm. Chloe would want you to have that. -How is she doin'? -She's fine. She's a tough kid. I'm gonna go up there later and bring them some food. -Oh, shit. It's Thursday. I gotta pay Big Al. - Like we can afford this. - Hey. Everything's gonna be okay. We'll get through this. - Hey, Bec. - Hey. - She's asleep right now. Actually, they both are. - No. That's fine. Don't wake her. I just wanna come by later on today maybe if you could give me the room number? - She's in Room 101. Come by whenever you can. - Hey, baby, did you check on Big Al? Oh, my God. Todd, are you okay? What happened? Todd.. -All you do is just take. - What? Todd, I'm gonna call you an ambulance. -Becca, you still there? -There is nothing left. I am nothing! Come on, come on, come on. -Becca? Todd? Todd, Becca. -Matt! I'm in the bathroom. There is something wrong with Todd! He's trying to kill me! -I'm walking towards you. -Okay. -Matt. -It's okay. Where's Todd? -I don't know. I don't know where the fuck he went. - No! - No! Oh, God. No! No! No. Hold on. Todd, buddy, put down the shears. Don't do it. It's okay. -Jesus. What is it? - Look! - It does look like the ones Henry had. - Jesus. Chloe. I need full medical backup. 79/12 Eagle Crest Drive. I need immediate support. - When do the new tests come back? -A few more hours. -Matt, where did you go? - Emergency at work. How is she? - She's not stabilizing like I hoped. - Doc, is it possible for skin to contact a drug or toxin to cause what happened to Chloe? -A drug? Matt, what... - Doc, is it possible? - Yes. - Amy, Chloe took something from the back of my car. It was a wooden box filled with figurines. She might have thought they were jewelry charms. - But... - Amy, charms? Did Chloe have one? - Yeah. She made a necklace, a... a bracelet. We turned it into a bracelet. So? - EMTs would've removed and bagged any items on her person. - I'm on it. I'll meet you at the car. - Matt, what is going on? What... the charms? And you... - I... I think they're laced and if Chloe handled them... - But nothing came up in the routine tox screen. But this severe asthmatic affect it would have been pretty nasty stuff. Way out of the ordinary. -Can you treat it? - If we knew what we were treating. Otherwise we're just shooting in the dark. -Okay, I'll find it. I'm gonna need you to stay by the phone. -Okay. -Wait. I have to tell Becca. Chloe gave her one of those things. What is it? -Did you tell her about Becca? -I told her enough. Becca was Amy's best friend. -I'm sorry. - What about you? You got anything? - Yeah. The EMT that brought Chloe in. It's his day off. His boss is gonna try to track him down. - Henry was in and out of backwoods psych clinics his whole life. He could have loaded up on all kinds of psychotropic shit. -Yeah, but.. I mean, what, are we gonna call every one of those places and ask for inventory records over the last 20 years? I mean how many of them are even still around? -You got a better idea? - Yeah, I think there's someone we need to talk to. -Jesus! Look at this place. - Well, she wanted that box so she must know something about it. Which is one more thing than we do. -Hello? - I was wondering when you'd come. - Miss DeGracie, we need your help. -Yes, you do. Come. Sit. - That night at the old hospital. You asked about this. -They're poisoned. -Yeah. I... I know. With what? - Nothing you'll find here or anywhere else. - Look, my daughter is very sick. Alright? So, I need your help. You said the dolls, they're... they're poisoned? - I had the feeling you'd be more comfortable with that.. Than if I said they are cursed. Oh, detective, you came to me. And I can help you, but only if you really hear me. You've seen this? - Henry drew this? - No. This was drawn a little bit before Henry's time. Have you ever heard of a worry doll? - Sure I have they are like children's toys. -No. Not all of them. The night I found Henry Bale.. I looked into his eyes. He was a broken boy. Innocence gone. I could see the darkness already growing in him. So, I gave him.. The worry dolls. The last of the original worry dolls and I explained to him their power. - Power? Come on. I knew this was a waste of time. - Detective, your daughter must be in great pain. -What are you doing? - So young. She must be terrified. And you can't help her. -Help me, daddy. -It's a paralytic. Just one drop. Yes. My grandparents lived in a small village of Huehue in the... Deep in the mountains of Guatemala. Their medicine woman was named Delate, my great-grandmother. One summer, the women started getting sick. Many died. The children were terrified including Delate's own daughter. Delate could not stand to see this. She believed that every child should know only innocence. And so she fashioned Munecas Quitapenas. Worry dolls.. From a wood of a very rare tree. Delate didn't just make dolls that simply calmed fear.. They removed it. When worries are told to the dolls they must be placed in the box. -The dolls.. They... they take worries out overnight. But Henry never slept. I shot him. Killed him. He knew we were coming down on him. He was expecting to die. - Oh, my God. Henry was trying to purge his soul. -And the worry and fear.. Carried by Henry Bale.. A man who had only known pain and hate remains in those dolls. Expressing through anyone unfortunate enough to have one. - So you're saying these people are experiencing Henry's fears? Seeing into his mind? - No. The fears were their own. The every day burdens that we live with but amplified to a level unbearable by most people. This became their reality. - Dogs. - What? -Chloe's afraid of dogs. -The only way to save her is to get the dolls and quickly. - But she doesn't even have the dolls anymore. -That doesn't matter. She's a pure innocent. Never had to deal with the fears of life. Ironic, people who have suffered the most have the strongest resistance. Your daughter is just gonna get worse. She'll die. In the meantime, you gather all the dolls and the box and bring them here to me along with your daughter. That is the only way. -How much time do I have? -Until dawn. - Amy, do have any idea where those dolls might be? -No, I don't. - Just think. I need to find the dolls. - Do you know what's happening with Chloe or not? - They're special. They belonged to Henry Bale. Somehow... - Henry Bale? Are you kidding me? You're supposed to be helping our daughter and instead you're back on your Henry Bale obsession? - Wait, wait, Amy. Just... just hold on. Becca didn't die in an accident. Todd killed her. - What? - Todd. He slashed her throat with trimming shears and he was wearing one of those dolls when he did it. That homicide at the mini-mart? He was also wearing one of those dolls. I know how this sounds but I need to find those dolls. This could be Chloe's last chance. Somehow it left something in her. And if I don't find them all the doctors, they're not gonna be able to do any good. So hate me, just help me. -Okay. Oh, my God. Help! Help! - That was fast. Did you get it? - Helps to have an evidence clerk who has asked me to drinks every week for five years. What do we got? - This is it. It's the only one after Trisha. If we find this one the only one left was the one Chloe had on her. Any word on the EMT? - No. Just an e-mail address? Didn't Amy remember anything else? - She said she was with an elder woman in a wheelchair. -Let's go. - That e-mail comes back to a Brittany Hayden. There are four Brittany Haydens in the county. I cross-checked hospitals for the wheelchair bound family members, but no luck. But my friend Savannah works in the city zoning office. Yeah. Address? Right. In the past ten years, only one household with the resident named Hayden had a zoning permit issued for a wheelchair ramp. I can stop crying Over you Can't sing half smiling Now I'm so sad and blue - Sweetheart, is your father home yet? That's too much water. - Lodge Street. Says it's a mile up ahead. - What time is it? - Midnight. - Shit. - Hey, we'll be fine. There's time. I can't stop praying.. - Sweetheart, well, what's wrong? - I can't see it. Dammit, can you see it? - No. - Dammit. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's okay. Hey, hey, look at me. It's okay. It's okay. Alright? We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay? - She's in there. Thanks, guys. - Still no word from Chloe's EMT. -She's all I got left. - Hey, we will find the doll. Alright? Chloe's gonna be fine. -Williams. Where's the EMT? - I don't know. - Is that it? - Yeah. I didn't touch anything just like you said. -That's not it. Ames, are you sure you don't know... - I don't. I don't know where doll is. If I knew I would tell you. If he doesn't have it, I don't know. - Sorry to interrupt. You... you said it was a doll? - Yeah. - Yeah I remember that thing. I... I bagged it. I gave it to her father. -Her father? Ethan. Where's Ethan now? - He went to clean up the mess and get Chloe's blanket. He's at the house? Now? -Hello? Anyone home? The door was open. Ethan? Ethan? It's Darcy. Matt's partner. Ethan? -Darcy? Ethan? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let her go, Ethan. - You... you have any idea how much I love her? But it will still not be enough. -Ethan. Please. - You have caused them so much pain. -Drop the glass. -And still, I will not have her like you had. What? Huh? What do I... What do I need to do? -He thinks I'm Amy, Matt. Please, you are making a mistake. -Ethan, listen to me. This isn't real. It's not Amy. You need to fight this. -No. I'm on to you. I'm on to you. -Ethan, Amy loves you. Chloe loves you. You've always been a better father. Amy.. Tell him. -Ethan, it's true. Sweetheart, I love you. I love you so much. Please, please, sweetheart. You're hurting me. Please, let me go. -That's it. That's it. I love you, Ethan. Don't doubt that. Never, never, ever worry. I love you. -Let her go. -No! No! No, no, no! - Oh, my God. What happened? What the hell are you doing? Matt! - You gotta trust me. Just trust me. -Where are you going? Matt! Matt! - Jesus. -Call Security! - It's okay, baby. It's gonna be okay. Hang on, baby. Hang on. It's okay, sweetheart. Hang with me. Don't you die on me. Stay with me. Come on, now. Come on, sweetheart. -Come. Put her here. -You need to stop this. Now. - I'm finishing up the quemara. Did you get them all? - Yeah. They're all there. Look, it's almost dawn. -You're in time. You've got blood on your hands. Here. -Thank you. What's next? -Why? - Because, you'd never let your daughter die. I must make that decision for you. - You were never going to destroy the dolls? - All that's happened since Henry's death what these dolls have caused. The bloodshed, the madness.. Your own heartbreak.. It is my fault. It will haunt me the rest of my life, burden my every day. - You wanna use them for yourself.. To cleanse your own soul. -No. Destroying the dolls was my intention. But as I saw their full power.. Think of it. Henry was the extreme. His innocence lost before the dolls could help him. But there are countless innocent children suffering. The dolls can help them. -My daughter will die. -Yes. Yes, so that others can live. I know how you feel. And I am truly sorry. We all have our cross to bear. It's almost dawn. Be comforted. She'll be at peace soon. -No. No! No! -It's okay, baby. Okay, baby. Daddy's here now. Daddy's here. No, no, no, no, no. Chloe. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on, baby. -I wanna keep you, daddy. -And I wanna keep you, baby. -Forever? -Forever and ever. -Come here. Let's go. Okay, here you go, sweety.
