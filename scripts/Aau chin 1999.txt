I'+B26ll see you in half an hour. Avina, make sure the financials are ready. I have an announcement to make. The meeting was a success. We have reached an agreement with BIC. When Mr. Lee comes here next week to sign, We will have completed the merger. What we need to review is Their proposal for a share swap merger. But That's going to cost us 18% more. And if the market changes, lt'll cost us even more. The contract needs a lot of amendment, We need a couple more drafts Before It's finalized. We may not have the financials ready In time. But if we get the PRC market share, Our profit will be very high. Conservatively speaking, We will net at least 5 billion. Therefore well have to make it work. You guys will have to slave it out In the next few days. By the way, in the last 2 weeks, have been stolen. The insured value is around 5 million. We have someone verifying the claims. Fine, approve their claims. We don't need any distraction. General... I have a hot tip! Wanna order something? Hear me out! A couple days ago My friend took me to see the owner. He's got a great horse! People are watching... That baby is a great performer, Loves a fast surface. I couldn't believe my eyes... That animal is the best sprinter! It had the fastest time.
