He has worked so hard. I wanna swing Swing till daylight with you I wanna dance Dance the whole night through Where the beat-beat-beat is jumping And the crowd is feeling fine Where the dance-dance-dances are popping Theirs are flowing like wine I wanna swing Swing till daylight with you I wanna dance... To look at us... you would think that we've got it all together. But looks can be deceiving. Some days are good and I think he loves me. Then other days... I think he doesn't care. Dancing till daylight Just us two Kicking up my heels... I never thought I'd see this day. I was just saying to my wife this morning... that if I died and came back... that I would want to come back as me. No, truly it is an honor... to receive the Jacob Frienstein Attorney of the Year Award. It's especially an honor because... He is so into appearances. What looks one way on the outside... can be a totally different matter on the inside. There is no way... no way... that I could have done any of this... without my wonderful wife of 18 years. I don't know this stranger I sit next to. All I know is that with every dime and every case... he has changed. How about l... run us a hot bath? I left something at the office. I have to go. Who is she? When you get a job and pay one of these bills... then you can ask me questions. I am still your wife. That's cute. Charles... I don't want to fight. This is your night. Let's just enjoy it. Tell me what I need to do, and I will do it. You really want to know what you ought to do? Get the hell out of my car. What a way to start our anniversary. Tell me...why do I love that man so much? Maybe if I could stop thinking about... how good things used to be... I might be able to find the strength to leave. Hi, Sarah. How are you? Hi, Mrs. McCarter. Hey, Mrs. McCarter. Kalvin, how are you? How is Joanne? -She's doing great. -That's great. -You doing all right? -I'm wonderful. Thank you. Listen, is he in? Because I brought him, uh... lunch. Actually, I'm headed that way-- No, no. Please. Thank you, though. Thank you. Helen. What, um... Um...hi. I'm Brenda Marcos. How do you do? Um...we got to go. You ready, little fella? It was nice to meet you. Is that her? Don't play games with me. Tell me, Charles. Is that her? Thank you. I'll see you at home. Excuse me. Excuse me! What? -What are you doing? -Working. Where are you going with my things? Lady, look...I'm just filling in for my cousin because he's sick. Somebody named Charles McCarter or something like that... rented this truck, told me to load it up and wait. So that's what I'm doing. No. Wait. Wait. Christina? Christina. Christina, there-- there is a man out there putting my things in a truck. What is going on? Mr. McCarter asked me to pack all your things this morning. And all these clothes are from the boutique. I wish I had a man to do something like this for me. Happy anniversary. -I have something to tell you. -Your gift first. Aren't you going to open it? Charles, I have to admit... I thought you forgot, but I saw all the clothes... in the closet and...ta-da! Ha ha! It's not exactly my taste, but I love it. Helen-- This one, it doesn't really fit quite right, though. I think I'm going to have to get some alterations-- Helen. You see how I keep interrupting you? Charles, I only want to hear the good tonight. OK? I need to tell you something. What is she doing here? I asked her to come. Charles, what is going on? Is she wearing the dress that I just picked out? What?! There's no easy way to say this... but our marriage has run its course. It's over. What? What are you trying to say? I'm saying... it's over. Charles! Helen, don't act so surprised. I mean, I haven't touched you in a year. I haven't...well... I haven't been happy for years. 18 years, and you think you can just come in here... and end it like this? Charles, what am I supposed to do without you? You're a bright girl. You'll figure it out. Charles...please. -Oh, my God. -Don't do this. Please tell me you're not one of those weak begging sisters. Brenda, let me handle this. You are not leaving. No...I'm not leaving. But you are. There's a truck outside. It's full of gas, and I hired some guy... to take you anywhere you want to go. I can't keep treating her like this. And my children... not seeing their daddy every night. I'm staying here and there-- Children? Two boys. They need me. Charles. It's me. How can you say this to me? How can you do this to me? Good-bye, Helen. Now, be a lady and leave quietly. -No. -No? You would've never had any of this without me. Now, you better get up out of here... -before I lose my temper. -No! No, I am not leaving! -You what? -No! You're leaving, all right. You're leaving. Go on. Any way you want to do it. Get up! Get up! Aah! No! Charles! No! Come on. Huh? Come on. What you doin'? Get out of here! Get out! Charles! Charles! Charles! Oh, what the hell have they got me into? Hey, look... we've been driving around for hours now. I do have another job that I have to be at in a few hours. So there's got to be someplace I can take you. Take me where? He has alienated me from my entire family. He made me put my mother in a home bec-- Because she didn't fit into his "American dream." I don't have anyplace to go. Lady, I'm really sorry to hear about that... but it's the middle of the night-- -Just stop the truck! -I'm trying to help you out. -Just stop the truck! -I'm not stopping the truck. All you men are just alike! You just think about yourselves! You don't think about anybody else but yourself! Just stop the truck, and I will drive myself... where I have to! Pull the truck over! Hey! Don't grab the wheel! Hey. Don't touch the wheel. I'm stopping. I'm stopping. -Then get out! -We're in the middle of nowhere. I don't care! Get out of the car! I'll drive myself! You know what? Now I see why you're going through... what you're going through. Oh, you go to hell! Have a nice life. Yeah, you're welcome! Don't shoot! It's Helen... your granddaughter! Don't shoot! What the hell? Girl! I always open the door this time of night shooting... 'cause there ain't nothing but a crackhead... or the police knocking on your door this time of night. What you doing here this late? I was in the neighborhood and-- You were in the neighborhood? I thought I'd come by and say hi. You live in a mansion on the other side of town. What the hell you doing in the ghetto? You ain't on that stuff, is you? Is you over here trying to buy some stuff? I missed you. Come by in the daylight here. Don't come by-- Madea, please. Come on in here. Who that is at the door? Shut up, Joe. I got this. ...I'm gonna have to put my foot down. Kunta Kinte put his foot down, and it got chopped off. Now shut the hell up and go back to sleep. I know I had some cigarettes in this-- Harpo. Harpo, who this woman? Joe, go in that room and take your medicine. You know you crazy as hell when you don't take it. I say hell...no. What the hell? Look what you done made me do! Oh, hell! Get the hell up. You didn't come by yesterday. You got to eat something out there on them streets. You got to be careful, you hear? Look at you. Lord help me. You ain't got no regular clothes, do you? What? Helen...hey. Debrah? Yeah, girl. You gonna hug me? Yeah. So, how are you doing? You look good. You look good. Marrying that rich lawyer. When we were kids, we both said we'd get a rich man, right? We both got lawyers. Deb, what-- what's going on? Don't. Don't do that. Don't judge me. Thank you. I got to go. You take care of yourself out there. Lord. You hungry? I can't eat anything. You need to eat something. What happened to her? Life. Brian and the kids must really be going through it. They're doing all right. But I want to talk about you. I called Charles this morning... and he told me, before he hung up... that you and him is getting a divorce. But what I can't seem to figure out is why you here. He put me out of the house. -Who house? -Our house. Exactly. How the hell a man gonna put a woman... out of her own house? He might've put me out... but he was gonna put me out of half. I'm gonna go in the other half of the house. He wasn't puttin' me out of all of it. The house is in his name, Madea. Lord have mercy. That's how women get messed up. Too busy out shopping when you need to be checking the deed. Whoo! That makes me mad, girl. I don't have any rights to the money. No right? I signed a prenup. What the hell you sign a prenup-- I ought to punch you in the face. Who the hell told you to sign a renup? He didn't have nothin' when you married him! Charles always knew he'd be successful. And he said to me... "l want to know that you're here for love." And I didn't have a job. So it's his money. Is it? What was you doing while he was working, honey? Taking care of the house, cooking and cleaning. Exactly. That sounds like a job to me. Cooking and cleaning-- how long you do that? 18 years. All right. OK. 18 years... let's see how much he owes you. 18 years... you've been cooking... cleaning... having sex with him when he wanted. -Was it good? -No. Major deduction. And I didn't tell you that he hit me. Girl, that man owes you 64 billion... 283 million, 974 trillion... 5 thousand... and 20 dollars and 82 cents. Now, you need to get your money. -That'll never happen. -You want to bet? I can happen one of two ways, honey. You can get it from his checking account voluntarily... or his insurance policy. Involuntary manslaughter. Which one it's gonna be? -Madea. -Mm-mm. I ain't gonna have this. Come on. -What? Where are we going? -To your house. Oh, no. The guard will never let us in. I said come on! Mayday! Mayday! Lord have mercy. Get your stuff. What the hell is wrong with you? These your clothes? They're hers. Oh, they're hers? Who is, uh... "Dol...say & Gab-anna?" Who that is? Dolce and Gabbana. They're designers. Oh. She a label ho. $700 for a damn rag? Just a rag. Madea, no, no, no. Don't do that. This man left you... for some old floozy. Madea, what's wrong? A wire hanger! Rip it. Rip it? -Rip it. -No, no. Rip it! -Rip it? Rip it! -Rip it! Rip it! Rip it! What the hell are you doing? Rip it like this! Get mad at it! It'll make you feel better! Rip it! Rip it! Rip it! Rip something! -Rip it! -Rip it! Rip it real good. Rip it. Wait a minute. What's this gonna solve? Nothing. It's just gonna make you feel better. -Rip it! Ha ha ha! -Rip it! This is for every black woman... who ever had a problem with a black man! Goodness. Calm down, girl. I'm tired as hell. OK. I'm gonna go down to the office. I forgot some things. OK...you go down in the office... because you forgot something. Find me some oxygen. And bring me some oxygen! What are you doing in here? Charles. Are you stealing from me? No. No, I just-- How did you get in here? I changed the locks. What the--who are you? Who are you? I'm the owner of this house. Wrong answer. My granddaughter Helen... is the owner of this house. You're the ho. You ain't got no power or no deed. Did you do this? This is Vera Wang! Who that is? She do nails? I need to get my nails did. That's it! I'm calling the police! I'm not scared of no popo. Call the popo, ho. Call the popo, ho! Charles, please... I don't have any money, and-- I tried to be nice to you, didn't l? Didn't l? I'll just go. You'll just go? I'll just take it, and I'll just go. Oh, you'll just take it and go, huh? You're gonna take my money and go?! If I call the police, they're gonna be here in ten minutes. OK. Then that leaves me nine to beat the hell out of you. You think? I know tae kwon do. And I know whoop your ass. Come on. Bring it on. You don't know me. I'm from the projects. Come on. What the hell is your problem? Come on. Shut up. Shut up! Oh, hell no. Watch out. Yeah, you keep running! What? Now you asking me questions?! You begging now? Oh, please do it. Please hit her. Please! I want to see you do it. What the hell's wrong with you? Here, now, you bastard. Put your hands on her. Oh, my God! Don't hurt him! Oh, I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm gonna kill him. Putting his hand on my granddaughter. I'm calling the police. You call the police, so they can see how you done hit her. No, just get out. Charles, I have been nothing but a good woman and wife to you. I don't deserve this. You will reap what you sow. Keep your money. You crazy as hell. Just leave it. I might leave some of it. It was this that made you the evil bastard that you are. Get out. Here, now, the way I see it... half of everything in this house belongs to her... and I ain't leaving here till she get it. -She'll never see it. -What did he say? Come on, Madea. Let's go. That's right. Go. Give me 5 minutes with her in the bathroom, please. Madea, let's go. OK. Oh, yeah. I'm leaving. It's just a matter of time... before he does the same thing to you. Never. I could never be you. I'm a woman who knows how to get and keep her man! What's that? Madea... Half of everything in here belongs to her. Which half do you want? Do you want this half... or do you want this half? Madea. Your Honor, case number 456790-- the People versus Mabel Simmons and Helen McCarter. Criminal trespassing, reckless endangerment... criminal possession of a handgun... assault with a deadly weapon... What are you walking so fast for? Suspended license, expired registration... reckless driving, and a broken taillight. Girl, I know that ain't who I think it is. I know you didn't say Mabel Simmons. Madea? How are you doing, Judge Mablean? It's good to see you. Your hair is pretty, girl. Look at you. You're looking good. How you been? You're still at it? This ain't even my fault. What had happened was-- Save it. Who's here for the defense? Brian Simmons here on behalf... of Mrs. McCarter and Mrs. Simmons, your Honor. -Brian? -How you doing, Judge Ephriam? I'm getting tired of seeing your aunt. I'm tired of seeing you. It won't happen again. Yeah, I bet. Bail is set at $5,000 for Miss McCarter... property or cash. But as for you, Madea... I'm placing you under house arrest. You ain't putting me on no house arrest, honey. I ain't fi'n to to deal with that. It's either that or prison. What's your choice? I'll take the house arrest. Bailiff, call the next case. The city of Atlanta versus Bobby Brown. What is this, repeat-offender day? Bobby! Bobby, I love you! Sit down, Miss Houston. -OK, you like hot sauce? -Put that lid down! What the hell? How the hell you do that? You don't know what we're playing? Hey, Daddy. I see you got Thelma and Louise out of jail. Yeah, I did. Hey, stop running. Stop running. Say hi to your aunt Helen. -Hi. -Hi. That's your son. Tiffany. -My God. How old is she now? -She'll be twelve tomorrow. Hey, baby. How you doing? -Can l? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. So... I saw Debrah. I didn't know she was so bad. Yeah. She took it pretty hard when you left. Charles wanted us to move away from anything... that reminded him of the past, and why I let him do that... Debrah and I were thick as thieves growing up, huh? Yeah, you were. I'll tell you what. Y'all about to be set. What you got? Oh, hell. Y'all don't know nothing about playing no cards. I'm gonna take mine and git. I could have spent my money in a better place. Did you hear me, John? We gonna play, or we gonna talk? Joe, let me get some. That's some good stuff. You want some, John? I guess not. Joe, let me get some. Last time we gave you some of this stuff, Mildred... we had to call the popo on you. We had to call the ambulance and everything. You went crazy as hell. You ain't supposed to smoke this when you're on lithium. I'm all right. All right. Don't wet up my butt, get the lipstick all over it. You act crazy if you want to. Whose play is it? Play something. Play something. Brian, can you handle my divorce? You don't even have to ask. I always thought that if I did all I could... God would bless my marriage. It takes a lot more than you doing all you can. And who's to say that this is not your blessing? You know, sometimes we hold onto the things... that God himself is trying to tear away. It's not that easy. You know women. We love hard. -And men don't? -Not like a woman. I don't know if I agree with that. We don't love as easy... but when we love, we love just as hard. You don't see men getting themselves... in situations like mine. The mother of my kids is a junkie... and I love her. That's a tough situation. Yeah. I look at Tiff-- she is so much like her. She wants to sing. I can't let her do that. She's not Debrah. Tell that to my heart. Orlando. O-dawg, what's going on, man? Big Brian, what's up, man? Y'all got it smelling real right around here. That's my deal, man. That's my deal. Hey, I want to introduce you to somebody. This is my cousin Helen. Helen, this is Orlando. Did I miss something? You two know each other? This is the sweet young lady... that threw me out of a moving truck. This is the crazy woman-- That's her. This town is too small. I think you owe me an apology. I don't owe you anything. I was just trying to help you out the other night. Oh, yeah, right. You're no good Samaritan. He paid it. It's not like you're some savior or something. I'm gonna go... check--do something. Just another bitter black woman, huh? Excuse me? I called you bitter, because now every man you meet... is gonna have to pay for what he did. You don't know anything about me. I know I watched a man drag you out of a house... and treat you like dirt. Now there's another story you can tell my cousin. And I'm not bitter. I'm mad as hell! Turn that off up there. Turn it off. Shut up up there, all that music. How you doing, Henry Lee? It's good to see y'all. See, I'm on house arrest. What is that? You don't even want to know, baby. You don't even want to know. Get somewhere and sit down over there, little boy... before I knock the hell out of you. Where's your mama? There you go. -Mildred, you all right? -Mm-hmm. Mildred, don't you start acting crazy. Give me, give me. Here. I'm gonna put this out. You acting like you crazy. I'll save that for later. Your play, Mildred. Play something. Help! Somebody help me! I'm out. What happened to my eyes? Everything is dark! Open your eyes, and you might be able to see something, fool. Crawling all over me! The rabbits! The rabbits are crawling all over me! You ain't supposed to be smoking that stuff, Mildred. Rabbits! Brian, please take her home to her house. I don't know why the hell you come over here... to my yard with that. Get on, rabbit. Go, rabbit. Go. Go, rabbit. Go. OK, the rabbit's gone. OK? All right. No more rabbits. Hey, Mildred, you forgot your rabbit. Don't come back over here no more, Mildred! Don't come back over here! I don't see no rabbit. That was good stuff we had. Is that a rab-- that's a rabbit! Here. Use this. What's this, your way of apologizing? Because if it is, I'm not accepting it. I'm sorry, mister. Hey, hey. My name's Orlando. Orlando. Willie, put some music on. Something we can dance to. You got it. Let's turn this party up. Y'all, come on. Dance. Come on. Everybody come on. Come on, Helen. You and that young man. Come on, young man. Come on. March 19. Dear diary... I look out at my family having fun and laughing... and everything in me is screaming for help. How do I get to that place? How? Go, Joe! Go, Joe! Go, Joe! Go, Joe! Go, Joe! Go, Joe! Hello? Chuck, this is Jamison. Man, I need to talk to you. You know what time it is? I don't really care what time it is. I got a situation. We need to talk now. It went bad. What are you talking about? -I shot him. -Who? Some cop undercover who was trying to sting me. What does that got to do with me? Charles, I need a lawyer and a judge. Now, there is $300,000 in that bag. That ought to buy me both, right? Look, I'm a legitimate defense attorney... and I would advise you not to try and bribe a judge. Look, man, I'm hot! I don't have time for all this legal stuff, man. OK, look, you know I don't deal with your kind anymore. My kind? Brother, before you started... defending all these rich white boys... it was my kind that got you down. -I'm going home. -Home? Oh, how quickly we forget. I ran so much coke for you back in the day... I paid for that house. Now look here. I need you, like you needed me... back in the day to get all you got. No. What you need is a lawyer... and not to ever call my house again. You are my lawyer. You know where to find me. Lord Jesus. All of this calamity in the world. But I tell-- The paper's sad. It's really sad. You nasty as hell. I don't know what I'm gonna do with you. Here. What? You need a job. Oh, Madea, I don't-- I don't know how to do anything. I got a job for you... as soon as I get some more Vaseline. Joe, that is your-- that's your family. That's your dead husband's side of the family. She ain't no kin to me. I could introduce you to Harvey. Maybe he'll help you out. She ain't selling no dope, Joe. If I had a bottle of battery acid... I would give you a chemical peel... just scrub all of that ugly off of your face. I know you're my brother... and the only reason I'm letting you stay in my house... is to get your check. But I can still get your check... if you come up missing. Keep trying me. But you're gonna end up in the Chattahoochee river. What you looking at?! You ain't moving in here. Next thing you know, she'll be getting mail here. Joe, leave that baby alone. If their name comes on the envelope... that means they move right the hell in. Get out. Get--get out. Baby, take that newspaper... and go on in the kitchen and look for you a job. And an apartment. Look for an apartment while you're in there. You always messing with somebody. What the hell's wrong with you? You're just grouchy as hell. You been grouchy. That's why Mommy and Daddy didn't like you. She ain't moving in here. Ain't enough room in this house for all of us here. This ain't "Roots." These rooms are barely big enough... for you to turn around in. Man, but you know, you're just huge. You big as a Buick. You just fat as hell. I watched you walk down the hall the other day. I thought somebody had put a refrigerator on your butt. You're huge. You're big. And that's something you'll never... in your life hear a woman say. Yes! Thank you, Mrs. McCarter. She's in her room. Hi, Mama. Hi. I brought you some things. Hey, baby. How you doing? Oh. I'm doing OK. Yeah. They talked to me about the bill here yesterday. They call you? Yes. I'm gonna get that paid. You know Charles don't care nothing about me. What makes you think he's gonna pay it? I talked to Madea. I know what's going on. I think I'm... losing my mind, Mama. He hurt me so bad. He was my everything. God is your everything. Don't you know he's a jealous god? He don't want no man before him. I don't even know where to begin... to pick up the pieces of my life. Lord have mercy. I was 39 years old when you were born. I never ever dreamed I'd have children. And then here you come... sweet bundle of joy. But what did I do? I think I shielded you way too much. Now you got to get out there... try to stand on your own two feet. Oh, no, Mama. I can't do that. I'm not strong like you. Sure you are. You got the strength God gave us women to survive. You just ain't tapped into it yet. Come here. Come on. Come on now. Oh... just let it go. Nothing wrong with shedding a few tears. It cleanses the soul. You know, you need to stop thinking... about what you think you lost... and look forward to what there is to gain. It's a new life, baby. It's right in front of you. All you got to do is reach out and grab it. How do I do that, Mama? How? By waking up every morning... and thanking God that you did. And then ask him to help you. Just ask the savior to help you. April 18. Dear diary, every day I wake up... I take my mother's advice. Most days, I don't want to get out of bed... but I do. Some people say, "One day at a time." Seems too long for me. Most days, all I can do is moment to moment. The good thing about being this low... is that there's nowhere to go but up. Hi. Can I get your order? Hi. OK, I'm gonna kill Brian. Did he tell you I work here? Hey, easy. Easy. A man's got to eat, right? What can I get for you? How about a coffee and a number four? We don't have number fours in this restaurant. OK. How about just a coffee? Coffee. OK. I like the new haircut... a lot. Thank you. Oh, no matter what You may be going through Take it to the master He'll see you right on through I know Jesus, whoo! Take it to him You can leave it there He will work it out No matter what You may be going through... April 25. Dear diary, today was a bad day. I got up and came to church because I was so angry. When I think about all the blood... and sweat and tears I put into my marriage... it makes me want to hate him. Let me tell you something, boss. I paid you a lot of money, and that judge, he ain't down. The judge had no choice... but to allow the videotape into evidence. I told you to make this go away. Say it wasn't me, I wasn't there. How the hell do you use self-defense? You're on videotape. And it will be very hard to explain... you not being there at the time of the murder. Self-defense is our only option. Then put me on the stand. I'll say it wasn't me. Then all your priors come into play. Look, Mr. Jackson, you have to let me work here. Look, man, you can get me off, make this go away. Look, I said I would do all I can. Well, that better be a hell of a lot, brother. Or I will do all I can. Wait a minute. Are you threatening-- Ain't nobody talking to you. I done paid you a lot of money. You know how it is on the streets, Chuck. Brother don't do what he say. However you and your homeys settle your disputes... this has to play out in court. -If I go down, man-- -If you go down? Kalvin, walk away. Walk away. Don't let this suit fool you. I don't take too kindly to threats, Mr. Jackson. And I don't make idle threats, Mr. McCarter. I better get off. May 12. Dear diary... I'm beginning to find my way. It's been close to three months... and every day gets a little easier. Even though we're still battling Charles in court... I don't even give it that much energy anymore. I don't understand this, but it's strange... how little can be so much when you're happy. I find myself smiling and laughing... more than I ever have. I find myself... Wait a minute. That's it. I'm finding myself. It's nights like this I wish I had a car... or kept that U-Haul truck a few more days. Hey. Brian asked me to pick you up tonight. He did? No, thanks. All right, but you know... the next bus doesn't come for at least an hour. I'll be fine. Why are you being so mean, woman? Why are you being so nice, man? You know, there are still a few of us nice guys around. All right. Suit yourself. Come on, now. This makes no sense. You'll take me straight home? I'll take you wherever you want to go. Just get in the truck. Come on. You all right? Yeah. This is some weather, huh? Hey, you know what? I'm kind of hungry. You want to stop and have some dinner? I have food at home. I was thinking you might like... a nice little salmon dinner at one of my favorite spots. Where is that? McDonald's? Actually, it's a little jazz bar called Chandra's. I love that place. There you go. All right. So? Are we going? -I can't afford Chandra's. -No, no, no, no. I got it. You got it? Yeah, I got it. And what do you do? Because I don't hang with drug dealers. I work twelve hours a day at McWorth steel, all right? I got the bill. Yeah. Well, this is not a date. Yes, ma'am. What are you looking at? A beautiful black woman. Is that all you see when you look at me? No. No, not at all. I also see a woman who's been hurt... a lot... and she's taught herself how to be tough... real tough. But, you know, the key is to be tough, not hard. And how would you know what the key is? Let's just say I had to learn it, too. Is that what you tell all your women? I don't have women. I had a bad breakup last year. And I guess you could say I've... I've been happily single ever since. Well, I guess... we've both had bad breakups, then. Hello. Welcome to Chandra's. I'm Chandra Currelley. This one is for the new couples... here for the very first time tonight. How do I start? Where do I begin? I've been hurt so much I just need a friend Could it be you? Will you break through these walls? Are you willing To help them fall? I want to love again... So, what did you do? What? Well, men always do something. Did her looks change? Did you grow tired of her? No. She decided she wanted a pro ball player. He had a lot more money than I had. I'm sorry. It's not a big deal. ...with you You don't know that These... Dance with me. No. I'm in my uniform. So what? Who cares? Look at me. Come on. No, no, no. Is driving me crazy Oh, my mind, my mind says no But my body says yes You're... Dear diary... this man is fine. How does he know I like to be held like this? Am I holding you too tight? Lord knows, I wanted to say, "Yes. Back the hell up." But he felt so good. It's OK. Dear Jesus, please let this man let me go... before I lose my mind. And he smells so good. What's the catch? Please let him say something stupid... like all men do at this time. You know, this feels like a fairy tale. No, he didn't! That was the right thing. What do you mean? Just me holding you like this. I used to believe in fairy tales, but... I don't anymore. And I'll, I'll do the rest Your every smile, your gentle touch I've... never been this close to any man... other than my husband-- my ex-husband. Charles--that's his name. He was supposed to be my fairy tale. He was my first... and my only. Here it is. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, I'd like to see you again... if that's all right. Orlando, I'm just getting out of a relationship and-- You know, it's so easy to say no sometimes out of fear. So how about just taking the hard road... and saying yes? Just this one time. I mean, what's so wrong about being friends? Nothing, I guess. Yeah. Nothing. So, I'll see you tomorrow? So, you're asking me out again? This wasn't a date, remember? -OK, I'll see you tomorrow. -There you go. I'll see you tomorrow. -You got it? -I'm trapped. It's old-school. I got it. -I'll see you tomorrow. -OK. -Good night. -Good night. When you're finished, you need to leave. Leave? I don't have nowhere to go. What do you want me to do? Open the house up to you? Give you the keys? You put me and these kids through enough. You need to go. You still have that picture. What happened to us? You. I don't want to do this anymore, Brian. Help me, please. No. Every time I try to help you... you disappoint me. This time, you got to help yourself. But I can't. God knows how many times we've been through this. You say that every time, and I wake up... the next morning, my wallet is gone. No, but I'm serious this time, Brian. Come on, please. I can make you feel good. Don't you want to feel good? It's time to go. I really am trying. Damn thing working on my nerves. You know, I was watching the Animal Planet channel... and they say that when a coyote is trapped... it will eat its own foots off to get out of the trap. You want some hot sauce? In your case, it wouldn't be a coyote. It would be a elephant! A big old giraffe! A big old giraffe! Say one more thing, Joe. Say one more thing. I don't hear you. You're quiet. Can I buy a vowel? It's open! Come on, Tiffany. Hey. Got to drop the kids off because I got to go to court. My cigarettes. How you doing? You all right? Hey there, little boy. What's going on? How you doing? Good to see you, B.J. What's wrong with you? She wants to sing in that church choir. You can join in at twelve. Go on in there and watch TV. Let me talk to your daddy. Madea, I don't want to hear it. She's not singing in that choir. Roll your eyes at me, get slapped. Brian, just because singing led Debrah to drugs... don't mean the same thing is gonna happen to your daughter. And why you put Debrah out of the house the other night? You need to try to help her. Hell, no! Don't do that. That is stupid! I've done all I can, Madea. You right. You right. Let me tell you something... what I learned. You can't turn no whore into no housewife. I'm telling him. I tried it with your mama. Whoo, that was terrible. Come on. Let's go out there. Madea, I can't keep putting these kids through this, OK? Brian, you is using them children like a crutch. You understand what I'm telling you? Any fool could see you love that woman with all your might. You need to help her. And at the same time, it might help you. Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it, I say! Don't do it! Listen, you take your daughter on down there... and let her sing in that church choir. That is constructive, what she's doing. She need to do something constructive. Love is stronger than any addiction, baby. Hell, it is one. You got time to eat? August 30. Dear diary... some random thoughts for you. Orlando and I have been out every night since Chandra's. That was almost four months. I keep waiting for him to change... to be this evil person... but it hasn't happened. I didn't know a man could be so thoughtful. It's like second nature. What? I'm just sitting here trying to think of a way... to say this to you. I'm in love with you. How do you know that? I don't know how to explain it to you. Try. Helen, if I'm away from you for more than an hour... I can't stop thinking about you. I carry you in my spirit. I pray for you more than I pray for myself. I got it so bad for you, I'd go to the grocery store... and I'd buy your feminine products. I swear I would. See? And that. That. That smile. Helen, when you smile like that... my world... it's all right. I am in love with you. Dear diary, when did I get here? Somewhere, out of all the pain... came a man who is strong... beautiful, sensitive... and Christian. Last night was so amazing. Even though we both wanted to make love... he chose to give me something better. He gave me intimacy. I haven't felt this way in... well...never. You know, what's strange is that I thank Charles... because if he hadn't been such a terrible man to me... I wouldn't know what a good one feels like. He can have it all. Your Honor, may I have a moment to confer with my client? It's fine. It's fine. Your Honor, let him have it all...everything. Are you sure? Yes... as long as he agrees to pay my attorney's fees... and my mother's stay in a nursing home... he can have it. So ordered. Mr. McCarter will retain ownership... of all said properties solely, and no alimony is ordered. Mr. McCarter will pay all Mrs. McCarter's attorney fees. Divorce will be granted... upon the signature of both parties after thirty days. Adjourned. Do you have any idea what you just did? Yes. Smart choice. Later, Charles. Smart choice. Will the defendant please rise? Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a unanimous verdict? We have, your Honor. What say you? We, the jury, find the defendant... Jamison Milton Jackson, guilty. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. I'd like to thank the members of the jury for their duties. Take him away. Sentencing will be in three weeks. This court is adjourned. Good looking out. Somebody get an ambulance! Hurry! We need an ambulance, please! Will someone get some help? Do you love me? Hey. Hey. Hey. Helen, my heart says that you do. Your actions say that you do. But you've never said it. The last man that I said-- No, no, no, no. Please... don't make me pay for his mistakes. If you love me, just say it... and you trust me with that information... because I promise you I won't abuse it. But I need to hear it. Yes... I love you. Now what? That's it. That's it. You just trust it. OK? Any time you want to give in to that fear... you let our love outweigh it. Right? -Yeah? -OK. Good morning. Orlando, what's going-- I know you don't believe in fairy tales. But if you did... I'd want to be your knight in shining armor. You've been through so much. I don't want to see you hurt anymore. Now, I may not be able to give you all that you're used to. But I do know I can love you past your pain. I don't want you to worry about anything. You just wake up in the morning. That's all you have to do, and I'll take it from there. There's one condition. You have to be my wife. Say something. What? What's wrong? -Oh, my God. -What? What's wrong? -What? -I have to go. Go? Go where? I'm sorry. -Where are you going? -I have to go. We removed two of the four bullets... but there's one that's very close to the spine. There's a great possibility... he could be permanently paralyzed. Are you his wife? I am soon to be. He won't be able to walk? It's touch-and-go at this point. We're trying to stabilize him... so we can perform this last surgery... but this bullet is in a very difficult place. I need to know, if things go badly... should we resuscitate? What do you mean, "If things go bad"? I have to be honest with you. It doesn't look good in there. Should we resuscitate? No. -Wait a minute. -Excuse me? I'm sorry. These decisions are usually left to the spouse. No, no, no. Legally, she is still his wife. Then you have to make the call. You do everything you can for him. You are so vindictive! What quality of life is that man gonna have if he can't walk? Did you not hear her say "possibility"? Why are you here? Helen, calm down. Why are you here?! Let me go. OK. I'm fine. September 1. Dear diary, tell me, why am I here? I know it's the Christian thing to do... but my flesh wants to beat the hell out of him. I want to hate him... but as I look at him... all I feel is sympathy. Charles? Hi. Hi. He came through pretty well. He can't speak, but he can hear you. What about the paralysis? Mr. McCarter, it's Dr. Shiloh. If you can feel this, I want you to blink your eyes. Don't get discouraged. It's not as bad as we thought. He is breathing on his own. He's suffered a lot of scarring and swelling... around the nerves of the spine... but as the swelling goes down... it's possible that he will be able to regain some feeling. Don't give up. September 19. Dear diary... as I sit here thinking about... picking up the pieces of what used to be my life... I realized something. Every room in this house holds a painful memory for me. Even though he's suffering... something somewhere in me wants him to suffer more. A few months and a divorce... can take you through just as many emotions... as 18 years in a marriage. And I'm starting to feel all of them at once. But the one that is clear is rage. Signed, a mad black woman. I don't see it. -You don't see it? -No. You ain't good for nothing. Find my bank statement and get the accountant on the phone. Then call Kalvin and tell him... to get over here, and you could leave. This is not gonna beat me. What you starin' at? All of this, and you're still the same. I'm Charles McCarter. I'm gonna die Charles McCarter. Look, I don't even know why you're here. I ain't giving you a dime. Call Brenda and get my kids. Where are my kids? Look, just get the hell out. I ask you to do one little thing... and you can't even do that after 18 years? Get out! Let me explain something to you. Old Helen is gone... and you will not talk to me like that. Now, I came here to help you... but now... I'm gonna get even. -Helen, you-- -Shut up! You want Brenda and your kids? Do you see what you left me for? This is what you left me for! She didn't give a damn about you, Charles. She told them to let you die. I was your wife. I loved you. I never would have hurt you! Why did you do this to me? To us? Answer me! And you know what's funny? I gave you life... even though you took it from me. Your kids... your boys... I wanted children, Charles! And had you not been with those whores... we would have them. Got me all stressed out-- my hair falling out, my weight up and down... can't keep anything down, two miscarriages! You took life from me... and you never even said, "I'm sorry." I'm gonna let you sit here for a few days... and think about what I've said. You stink. Helen, what you doing? Hey! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, stop! "Bathe him, feed him... "clothe him," they say. What about me? What about me? Oh, stop making those bubbles. You kicked me out of our house! You tried to keep me from our money! No. I was there... when all we had was each other. Helen. Are you hungry? Maybe you should go into the kitchen... and get yourself something to eat then. Christina. Christina? Christina's gone. Your little tramp didn't leave any money to pay her... so she left, just like your little slut. She packed all her things-- and some of yours-- and left. Come to think of it... she cleaned out your bank account... all of it. You tried to keep it from me, and she took it all. Lord have mercy. Charles, you are like so many men. You'd rather leave with trash... than make it work with a good woman. You're a coward. -Here you go. -Thank you. Hi. I thought you were gonna stand me up. No. Can I get a cranberry juice, please? Helen, I haven't heard from you in three weeks. What's going on? I have a lot of things going on right now, Orlando... and I don't think I can complicate it. Complicate it? I'm a complication? Thank you. My husband's back home. We're back together. Helen, don't you do this. That man did everything in his power... to try and break you, but you made it. You found strength and passion for life... you never had before. Why would you turn back? Why? You can't answer me, can you? Well, I know the answer, because I was just like you. Every time things were going good... I would always find a way to mess it up. I would sabotage, just like you're doing. But, Helen, I learned that I do deserve... to have good things and a good life. And I deserve you. Helen, look at me. Look at me. You're a good woman, and you deserve me. You want out of that life. I know you do. The only reason you're going back to it... is because you are still afraid. I'm right here. Helen, I love you. But I need you to trust me. I'm sorry, Orlando. Don't. Don't. Don't. What? What? Don't what? Don't what? What? What? What do you want from me? What? Am I supposed to say, "Let's be friends"? -ls that what you want? -Yes. You don't get it, do you? See, when you really love someone... you can't just be their friend. I don't want to lose you. And I don't want just half of you. What's that on the dog's leg? It's a flea and tick thing. A flea and... Mm-hmm. Come on. That don't look like no flea and tick thing to me. That looks very strange. What is it? Madea, we're here! Madea. Madea. What's that on the dog's leg? Lord, Myrtle Jean, look at you. You're looking good, girl! I just come from church. Go ahead on, honey. You look good. When you coming to church? I'll be there as soon as you get a smokers section. I'm gonna be right there. Yeah, you look good, Myrtle Jean. You look real good. How are you doing, Joe? I'm good. Come here, baby. Come here. Come here. Come here. I got Viagra. Come here, baby. I got Mace. You're just as mean as a snake, Myrtle Jean. You're mean as a snake. Listen, next Sunday I'm cooking a big old dinner... and I want all of y'all to come by here. Helen, have you called Orlando? That boy been calling here... and coming by here like he's crazy. Who's Orlando? Her boyfriend. My friend. And yes, I did talk to him. Baby, don't you open that door... before you've closed the other one. You hear me? Myrtle Jean, can I get you to open the door for me? Knock, knock. Open wide. Shut up, you old fool. That all sounds real good... sitting there telling your mom he ain't nothing but a friend. But I don't know if I believe that, honey. There's something going on between y'all... the way you've been walking around here... just smiling and grinning all the time. Mm-mm. I'm too busy taking care of Charles. I don't have time for Orlando. You're better than me... because I would be beating the hell out of Charles, honey. Yeah, like that man in "Misery." That woman took that board... and she put it on his ankle bone... and she broke both his foots off. They went just like this. Both his foots went like this. Broke both of them. That's exactly what I'll be doing-- breaking something. I'll tell you, I learned a long time ago... that God could take care of folks far better than you can. God takes too long sometimes. I need them to get got right then. That's why I don't worry about folks. They can't make me happy, and they can't make me sad. What did the pastor say? You know I don't know. I'd be trying to read that Bible... or go to church or something and sit there... and I looked down at that New Testimony and saw Jesus-- you know, the one with the words in red. I look down and saw all that red the other night. I said, "l can't sit here and read all of this." Jesus was talking too much for me to read all of that. Ain't that the truth? It seems like every time... you open up the Bible, you gets-- any time anybody opens a Bible, I just fall-- I'm just playing. You looking just like Beyonce. Sexy thing. Peace. Be still. That's what he said. Peace. Be still. You know what? Peace is always still around me... 'cause I keeps me what they call a piece of steel. As long as you've got a piece of steel... you're gonna have peace. Load your steel. Thank you, Jesus. You're not reading the right part. Look here. That all sounds real good and everything... talking about the "peace, be still"... and the Bible and all that stuff. But you got to be careful... 'cause I remember this man did me wrong... honey, I didn't even know how mad I was... till I got to his funeral. He had died. -Why were you so mad at him? -Because he hit me. Yes, he did. He hit me. And he is eight feet under. Six feet under. That's where they bury folks--six feet. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I thought I was over what the man had done to me... till I saw him laying in that casket. The man was dead, and I got mad all over again. I beat him down two more feet. I was mad as hell. Listen, you think you're over something... you think you're ready to get on with your life. This is how you really find out if you're over something or not. If you get an opportunity to get even... with somebody who did you wrong and you don't take it... then you're over it, but if you don't... and you beat the hell out of them... you ain't over it yet. Baby, tell me something. How are y'all doing? I'll tell you how she's doing. She's beating the hell out of him. How did you know? Child, you've been around me. I know something done rubbed off on you. You haven't hurt him, have you? Just his feelings. You know, I know this man put a hurting on you, baby... but you got to forgive him. No matter what he done, you got to forgive him-- not for him, but for you. Forgive him for me? When somebody hurts you... they take power over you. You don't forgive them, they keeps the power. Forgive him, baby. And after you forgive him, forgive yourself. Forgive me. -For what? -This. Oh, lord have mercy. You know, you just don't have no couth. That's what's wrong with you. John, $35,000 is not enough... for me to take to my client. I'm on the phone, sweetheart. No. No way. You talk to your client and-- Stop! Stop the car! Stop! That's Mom! I'll call you back, John. I'll call you back. Can I go talk to her, Dad? Please? Dad! Can I go talk to her? Go on. Hey, Mama. Tiffany. Hey, girl. Mom...Dad let me sing in the church choir. That's good, baby. And I wish you would come. You know I ain't got nothing to wear. Well, the service starts at 10:00... if you want to come. Tiffany. -Bye, Mama. -Bye. I can feel on my right side. Are you going somewhere? Actually, I was waiting on you. What do you want? I don't have anyone. Everybody who I thought was my friend... has turned their back on me, and it hurts. But not nearly as much as what I've done to you. You are a good woman, Helen... and a good person. So...don't be like me. You always used to tell me... "God has the power... "to show you who's God." I get it. Even though I almost destroyed it... I know you still have a heart. For everything... everything... that I have ever done wrong to you... I'm sorry. I... am so... sorry. See, what I love about God... is that when he asks a question... he already knows the answer. He asked Ezekiel, "Can these bones live?" He asked the lame man, "Will thy be made whole?" Somebody's been made whole up in here today. Come on and give him some praise. He asked Abraham... "ls there anything too hard for God?" God is asking you that question right now. Is there anything too hard for God? Is there anything too hard for him? What will you believe God for today? God can deliver you out of any addiction... situation, or anything that you dislike. Come on, somebody. What will you believe God for? Come on, choir. The doors of the church are open. Come on. Come on and bless his name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Father, can you hear me? We need your love today I know that you are listening You hear them every day Father, please hear us And we will be OK Father, we need you To live and lead us today Father, can you hear me?

Y'all ain't had greens like this before, baby. I put my foot in it. Give me some cornbread. Go ahead and eat something, Myrtle Jean. You know I'm hungry. Charles? You know I love you, right? Yeah.
