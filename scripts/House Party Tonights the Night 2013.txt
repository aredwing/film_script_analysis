Are you saying your parents are out of town and you got the crib to yourself? Oh, no! Don't even think it. We're gonna have the house party in your house. No, because we're not destroying my parents' house. - You're crazy. - Don't you see? It's fate. This is your moment. My moment? Look, I like rap, all right? But I don't know if I want to do it for the rest of my life. Bullshit! You want to be a rap star, Chris. You always have. Look, I told my folks I'd be mature. I didn't tell you, but they got me a graduation gift. A '85 Camaro. Riding. That's a crazy vehicle! - And I will do sex in it when the time comes. - No, you won't. But in the meantime, we're gonna make this party... ...an exclusive, invite-only affair. I'll invite Doobie and Keniston Scott, you invite Autumn Rose. She's just a beautiful flower waiting on you to pollinate her. - All right, 10 people at the most? - Fifteen, hard limit. How about that? - You think Autumn really likes me? - Yeah. But she needs to see you in star mode to seal the deal. And tell her to leave the boyfriend at home. For sure. All right. Keeping it small, right? - Real small. - Miniscule. - All right. - Like your package. Oh, don't even play me, dog, I'm blessed, all right? House party? Hell, yeah, I'll be there.

Plumbing problems, you know? - Anyway, this is my partner on the mic, Chris. - Chris. - Nice to meet you, man. Thanks for coming. - Nice to meet you. - Sorry about all this. - At least you got some scotch out of the deal. Finest libation these lips have ever experienced. So, um, what'd you think? Of our performance? I mean, despite everything. You can be honest with us. Well, until the shit hit the fan, I say you guys did a damn good job. Great, in fact. Me and Chris, we write the lyrics together... ...but he's the featured rapper, I basically just back him up. But, you know, I lay down all the beats, you know, produce it. So we both know our roles here. So, uh, you saying we both have a shot at a record deal? Better than a shot. I'm gonna go on record right now and say it is going to happen. - All right! - Whoo! - Now we're talking! - Yeah! - This is amazing! - This is crazy. All right, uh, so how does this work? Do we do it here or do we fly to New York? You know, sign it there? What's up? - What you talking about, Willis? - How does it normally work with the label? - What label? - Uh, Kickpower Records? You know, your label. You are Keniston Scott, right? I'm Gary. The limo driver. Limo... - Limo driver? Man, I brought... I brought those kids there, man. Whoo! So why did you pretend like you were some big shot record executive? Look, man, I just came in for a drink. I never said I was anybody. If there was some misunderstanding, I'm sorry. He's got my scotch, dog. Did you even ask his name? I saw the suit, he had the attitude, I just thought... You thought you knew what a record executive looks like? Did you even Google him? Look, guys, this seems like an honest mistake. But what you guys did up there, that was inspiring. Look, I might not be in the business... give up your dreams... ...you end up in a black suit driving a limo. Believe it. Thanks. Whoo-hoo! I got them moving again with my set. No, because it was my set got the party jumping at first. Whatever, DJ Duct Tape. Ready to go back to the party? I can't go back down there. They all hate me. You're really beautiful. Whoo!

Yo, it's a shame, uh, you can't really mix on the fly. Because we could have had a serious battle to see who's best. What? You wanna battle? Like... Like you and me? Yo, wouldn't be a battle. It'd be an ass whooping. You know that. All right, you said it. Let's do it. Age before beauty, son. That's a great line, but, um, I'm younger than you, idiot. Oh, okay. But prepare to get served on the ones and twos, homey. Bring it. Man, that sounds like shoes in a dryer. Always hating, man. See, I keep it unfamiliar.

You willing to ease up on the old school? - Call us Bootytime and Hardcap. - Oh, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's Hardcap and Bootytime. Don't think I didn't notice that last fade. It was far from smooth. You know what it's called? It's called human. Hell, yeah. All right, so you can keep working on mine. Let's dance. I'm not really in the mood. Well, I am. Let's go.

She about to get in on that Johnson, Johnson! - Just lay back, it'll be cool! - Help me. I'm-a help you. - I'm-a help you. - No, no, no. No, no. - Victoria, please. - Please! Oh, I'm gonna please you. Ow. Oh. Well, looks like somebody needs a drink now. Thank you for the dance, Christopher. Somebody get me a drink. He's all yours, Twiggy. All right, everybody, ain't nothing to see here. - Looks like you're having fun. - Really? You call getting attacked by a wildebeest, fun? - Autumn. - Yo, she get her mouth around the tip? She get her mouth around the tip? - No! What are you talking about? - Not even a taste? No! DyI... Dylan. Dylan. You can take your stupid chain back. - What did you say to me? - Let go of me, Quentin. - Quit being such a bitch. - You're hurting me. - Let go. Yo. - Mind your business. Step off. - This is my house, it is my business. Been bird-dogging my girl all night. - Step off, punk. - Yo, get out my house. And I don't remember inviting Chris Brown. Come on with it. You gonna get this ass-whooping... - ... you been earning since third grade. - I was thinking the same thing. Come on, let's go. - Take it to him, Chris. - Don't do this. Oh. Get him, Chris. Stick and move, baby. Mayweather in the house. Come on, little Chris, come on. Ha, ha. That's all you got? Uh-uh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Come on. Come on. That's my homey. That's my homey. Get him, Chris. Oh! - Oh, damn. Told you, punk! Yo, Autumn, let's go. - We leaving right now. - Screw you. What? - Screw you. You want this bologna pony? You can have him. I'll call one of my other bitches. This party's whack. Later for y'all. Oh, hell no. Who threw that? Oh, I swear. Argh! What on earth moved you to speak at the reception? Come on, Mimi, people do speak at funerals. Yeah, but, you got up there... ...and said "Don't blame God. Blame the hump. " Yes. I was trying to offer comfort. You saw her in that casket. Look... Looked like she was trying to reach out after everybody... ...with that hump holding her up, just... Grr. Honestly, they probably should've cremated her. You know your Aunt Coot, huh? You think that hump would burn? I'm sorry, I know it's your family, but that was freakish. I mean, you saw her in that casket... ...just still slowly rocking back and forth on that hump. That was scary. Kids were screaming, "Close the casket!" They couldn't close the casket. She had a big old hump. Yo, move away from the light. Stay away from the light. You okay, Rocky? More like Apollo Creed. - Yo, what'd he hit me with? A pipe? - That'd be his fist, bro. He way too big for you. Come on. Maybe it wasn't the smartest thing, taking on a monster. Letting you talk me into this party wasn't either. Oh, so now it's my fault you got knocked the hell out? Look at my crib, bro. Look at it. Shit's broken! The good booze is gone. The floor is destroyed. Now there's a hole in my ceiling... ...and the toilet's sitting in the living room! You did me wrong, partner. Hold up. We made this decision together. No. You made this decision and guilted me into going along. Guilted you? Don't... Don't you see? The second you're done with tonight you're done with me. Come on, that's bullshit. You don't think I know why you went along with all this? You feel sorry for me, don't you? Damn. It's true. So let's just call this what it really was then. A going-away present from a college-bound winner to a neighborhood loser. I even heard your father say it, and you didn't say shit about it. I do what I always do when it comes to you, Dylan. I suck it up because you're my best friend, Dylan. But, damn, best friend only gets you so far, man. - Truth is, you're just selfish, dude. - You know what? You're just scared. I'm scared? Think you might not make it as a rapper... ...so you act like you don't want it, but that's punk ass shit. What else do you want, man? I got new responsibilities. Look, one of these days, bro, you're gonna have to grow up. Because if you ain't noticed, we ain't kids no more. Look, man, look... - Go, Dylan. - Yo, whatever, dude. You were so mean to him. He's still your best friend, Chris. I know. I know. I'm gonna call him later or something. Okay. Well, thanks for standing up for me. That was some crazy ass heroics. But why'd you do it? Heh. You know, uh, I sat behind you in second grade... ...and, uh, ever since then, I known exactly what I wanted. Well, why didn't you ever ask me out? What if you rejected me? Oh, my bad, Chris. What? That's it! All right. Everybody, the hell out! Drive safe. Did you see what happened? I guess these old bones just don't attract anybody no more. Guess that makes me an old fool. That is where you're wrong. - You've been waiting for Chris? - Heh. Guess what. I've been waiting for you. Through all those years of your bad marriage... ...you think I just stuck around out of friendship? Let's go back to your place and talk about it. Kee Kee, baby. Tracey! Oh, I feel so alive. Let's go. Let's go. Damn. Best house party ever. Chill out. - Everybody. - Thanks. All right, man. Yeah. Drive safe. Especially you. I would have rode that driver's bald head. Come on. Whoo! I love you! I love you! Wow. Yo, Chris. You want us to help you clean up this shit-hole? We got all our gear packed up, but we can hang for a while. Thanks, man, but unless you think... ...you got enough Clorox sheets and duct tape to fix it... What you think? Nah. But you throw another jam, holler at your boy... ...I'll bring my junior partner, we'll blow it up for you. Yo, later, Chris. Yo, what you mean, "junior partner"? Where's Morgan? I think she left with Dylan. Mind if I stay with you for a little while? If this is some kind of suicide watch, don't worry. I gotta stay alive long enough for my parents to kill me anyway. Right. But, uh, I don't really feel like being alone. So, yeah, I'd appreciate it. Okay. Baby, sometimes I honestly... I have a hard time reading you. Okay, honestly, me and you... ...have you ever faked an orgasm? No. Okay, see, that's what I thought. Because I come from love-making stock. You know, we Johnsons. My name is Johnson. I mean, the name says it all. My daddy, Richard Johnson. His uncle was Harry Johnson. I mean, it's in the family... My name, Melvin, that's from my ancestry. I'm a Hausa. The Hausa language. "Melvin" in Hausa means "massive. " Massive Johnson. For years in college, I was known as Massive Johnson. M- A-S-S, I use that as a first name, "Ive" as my middle name. I was just Massive Johnson. We're the original love-makers of Africa. People would come around the African camp to learn how to make love from my people. Get up, bro. What are you doing? Cleaning up the mess I made, man. I told you already, there's no point. Oh, yeah? Don't be so sure about that. Come on in. Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. Come on, I got four maids for the basic cleaning. Yo, come on, hurry up. I got a couple plumbers to install a new toilet... ...and carpenters to fix that hole in the ceiling. And lastly, top shelf booze to fill the cabinet. Your pops won't even know it went dry. Yo, I can't believe this. But how we gonna pay for all this, though? It's all good. I sold my car. You sold your car? You was right, bro. I used you tonight. And that's messed up. I'm not even a good rapper. Don't... Don't talk like that, bro. Seriously. I mean, you produced all the tracks, you hustled the connects. You don't need me to make you a success, bro... ...because you make you a success. You were right about one other thing too, man. I am afraid to fail. I mean, without you, bro, I probably wouldn't have taken any risk at all. Maybe we both messed up. But we threw one crazy ass party, huh? Come on. Great. Okay, so tell me the truth. Are you the one who convinced him to sell his car? I'll never tell. What you doing? I'm just imagining the possibilities. I see. Get in the back seat. - Back...? - Mm-hm. Yeah. Is that your phone? Uh, don't stop. Don't worry. There you go, baby, here are the keys. Oh, I just wanna curl up in my bed and sleep. Yeah, me too. After we... Heh. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, uh-huh, we'll see about all that. Oh, yeah, we will see. You can talk all you want to, but you are a woman in trouble. You don't know what's gonna happen up in the bedroom. Uh-huh. Promises, promises. You can scream all you want, but I cannot hear you. Call 911 now. - Aah! Baby. - It was the neighbor. You are so naughty. Oh, my God. I don't believe it. Damn! It's cleaner than we left it. Oh, that's my boy, baby. My boy did this. Not your boy, that's my boy. - I'm gonna check upstairs. - Oh, you do that. Huh. Yeah. Come on. Chris. Oh, um, uh... Hi, Mr. Johnson. Uh, Pops, uh... Oh, shit. I'm sorry. What did I tell you about having girls in the house? You're lucky it was me and not your mother. I know. You Dylan? Yeah, that's me. Can I help you? I'm Keniston Scott from Kickpower Records. You missed a great party. Yeah, but I saw the best part. Rapping Toilet Porn. DJ Hardcap salute One last thing I got to do Whack chain Q I'm watchin you Then wink at your girl I got you, boo 'Cause you treat her bad Dump him, let me be your man Q stands for Quit I don't ever flush but I am the sh... Get back! You've had eight million views in less than 12 hours. Huh? Melvin! Just don't tell your mom, okay? Oh, hey. Uh-oh. What's going on, baby? I just saw our house... ...completely destroyed in a video online. You've got a lot of explaining to do, young man. We famous, dog! Yo, that record exec from Kickpower Records... ...he saw Rapping Toilet Porn. - He loved it! - What? How much ecstasy did this boy do last night? How much? So, uh, you really liked our rap last night? - I loved it. - Wow. If marketing is the name of this game... ...you two have created something money can't buy: - A viral audience. - What does that mean exactly? It means you have made a name for yourselves... ...and you've got the skills and the talent to back it up. So, gentlemen, on behalf of Kickpower Records... ...I'd like to offer you a development contract. I want you in New York in two weeks to meet the heads of the label... ...start working in the studio... ...and let us start capitalizing on all that publicity. What do you say? I say, hell yes! Uh... Moms, uh, Pops... ...I really want this. But, you know, not if you guys are not behind me. And I'm still going to college, right on schedule. I promise. I've never broken any promises to you guys. Oh, okay, so that wasn't our toilet we saw scattered all over the internet... ...with a big girl humping the...? Okay, that one time. But, Pops, I promise... Your father and I need a talk. Well, this is pretty suspenseful. Who you telling? Okay, you want our opinion? Give me that contract. I'll let our lawyer take a look at it. Yeah! Whoo! Son, you're a... You're a grown man now, son. Despite you doing that footsy dance with your best friend. Ha, ha. I'm kidding, son. It's time for you to start making your own decisions. Here you go, that's for you. Oh, Chris, hold on. And this, uh... This is for you. - Wow. Ha, ha. My boy is going to New York in style. Yeah. Oh, what you looking at? Oh, this is our boy. Yes. The one with the college, the babe, the car... ...and the record deal. I've always liked you Australians. I'm from London. Oh. Did you know there's a London in Australia? That's what he said. Give me some of that. Okay. All right. Son, I'm so proud of you I could just bust. Come on. Whoo. I'll miss you, Mom. Go on before your mama start crying. Hey, fool. Take care of that fool! Wouldn't be here without you. No shit. Chris, call me! Call me now! Bye-bye. Oh, boy. Why don't we go upstairs... ...and see if we can break another toilet? Whoo! Hey. Get ready to go to Dylan Town. I mean, uh... What's up? What's up? Hey. How you feeling, love? Good. It's on. Whoo-hoo! I got your purple urple... ...white Rolexes, blue dolphins, mall E, purple pterodactyls... ...red leprechauns, pink Playboys, black market Advil. Anything you need, really. You guys don't realize how lucky you are. The founders of this label... Actually, the hottest producers in the business... ...took time away from their world tour... ...to produce your first single. Well, good luck. You'll need it. Let's do it, man. Thanks, Doobie. Bass right there in that spot, you wanna play it again. I think we need some boom bap. Give me that boom bap. What are you talking about? The boom bap era is over. You have to drop the bass there and play it again. What? What? What? Oh, that's right. Hey, uh, Chris and Ryan, right? - Dylan. - Yeah. Yeah, whatever. Yo, man, they don't look like such a big deal to me. Not much to look at, true... ...but they kind of remind me of two other clueless guys... ...who used to be just like them. - Really? - Mm-hm. Oh, well, I guess you gotta start somewhere. Mm-hm. Gentlemen, pick your jaws up off the floor, it's time to get busy. Let's do this. Remember, pressure is a privilege. What? Man, never mind here what Confucius is trying to say. After we finish carving this turkey up, we're gonna call our peoples... ...we gonna get together and show y'all what... ...a real house party's supposed to be, you hear me? - You feel me? Yeah. - I heard y'all was doing our dance. - We kill it, let me show you. Don't do that no more. - Don't do that no more. - No more. No more. Uh-uh. Spread it out and let it melt down your chin, bitches.
