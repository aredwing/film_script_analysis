You can get yourself back in. (BEEPING) You're mad. - Birdie. - Don't call me that. We can skip your exercise. You fit that in last night. I was... trying to talk to you. I'm not interested in that talk. - Anna... - No. It won't change anything. (DOORBELL RINGING) (CHAIN CLATTERING) Hey. You must be Anna. Who are you? Oh, sweetie, did he not tell you that I was coming? I'm the lawyer. So your brother's already approved these. He's taken care of everything, so when the time comes, you won't have to make any arrangements. I just need a signature. Anna, I'm here to help Conrad get what he wants. What he wants is for you to be taken care of. My mother had it too. Not pancreatic, but... I do know how hard it is. And acceptance is only a choice that you can make. (HONKING) Then I won't choose. Submitted for your approval. Today's offering: Meatloaf. LOAF: Confirmed. Meat: Jury's out. Green beans almondine: Nutty, beanie. And the pice de rsistance? Apple cobbler: Sweet, tart. Uh-huh. Uh... it's... it's really good. This a bad time? No, she was just leaving. As soon as I get a signature. (MUFFLED CRY) (THUD) - (PANTING) - Okay, alright... I got you. Okay. Okay. It's okay. (HUMMING) (CRYING) (HUMMING) (BEEPING) I don't know how I'm gonna do this without you. Ah... I'll be with you. You don't believe in that stuff. I'm not talking about that stuff. I'm talking about us. What we've been through together. You're stronger now because of it. Hey... you can't stay locked up forever. You have to get out and be a part of the world. I want to leave me alone. That's not the way it works. It's time to forgive Dad. - Birdie... - Stop. I will never forgive him for what he did. Anna... (LABOURED BREATHING) (BEEPING) (LOUD BEEPING) (CHIRPING) (RUMBLING) (HONKING) - (DOOR CREAKING) - I have terrible news. Beef Stroganoff. But there's a glimmer of hope. Tater tots! Maybe it's good. He's not suffering anymore. There's gotta be some kind of relief in that, right? You've been so strong this whole time. Never heard you complain. Not once. On this job, trust me, it's rare. (SNIFFLING) It's not a relief. Yeah... sorry, that came out wrong. All I mean is... it's impressive, you know. You're impressive. So what's the plan, then? Are you... gonna keep the place, or... What? Are you gonna keep the place? Oh, of course. Where would I go? No, it's just some people need to leave in order to move on. But... this is my home. Yeah, okay. Could you leave that easily? You know, I shouldn't have asked. No. Could you? Well... not everybody feels so strongly about home. Not everybody feels like they have a home. - Then why haven't you left? - One guess. Girlfriend. No. I haven't really made the best decisions in that department. Whoa. That's your last reason for not leaving, right? Uh, I... I... I can't take this. No, I have more than I know what to do with, honest. Take it. Make your escape. I'm sorry. I just can't. (PHONE RINGING) (ANSWERING MACHINE): Hello. You've reached the Rook residence. Conrad and Anna aren't available right now. If you leave a message, I will return your call. (BEEP) (WOMAN): Hey, Anna. This is Charlotte. I was just thinking about you, and I wanted to let you know how proud I am of you for, you know, facing your fears, and getting out there and going to your brother's funeral. Um, so I guess I'll see you there. Okay, bye-bye. (BEEP) Hey, Anna. This is Charlotte. I know you've been struggling, but you can do this. I'll see you at the funeral, sweetie. Stay strong. (BEEP) Anna, are you there? Anna, please pick up the phone. Look, the funeral's starting. If you leave now, you can still make it. Please come. I really hope you... (BEEP) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Hey, go around back. And don't let anyone see you. (DOORKNOB RATTLING) (RAGGED BREATHING) Alright, let's make this quick. You know what to look for. (THUMPING) (KETTLE WHISTLING) What's that? Find her. Cut the phone line. - (GLASS BREAKING) - Ah! She's upstairs! What the hell? You're not supposed to be here. Please, stop looking at me. Please, okay? Explain it to me. Why aren't you at your brother's funeral? You're Anna, right? Okay, Anna... I need you to be straight with me. I need to know where you keep the money. What are you doing? Always be prepared. I'm sorry, prepared for what? This is fucking crazy, JP. We should just fucking leave, goddammit! Use my name again, why don't you?! Go ahead! There's nothing on the scanner. So... looks like she didn't call anybody. Did you? You're an odd bird. Look at me. Three men break into your home and you don't call the police? I was scared. I... didn't have time to think. I have a solution. Just a quick little love tap behind the ear. We are not doing that! We are not doing that! - Hey. - Then we burn this fucker down. Fucking Chri... you gonna stop this shit? Hey, go make some coffee. - What? - Go make some coffee. Go. Let the adults talk. Ah, fuck it. So? We're not killing anyone. Can I leave you alone with her without making a mess of things? - Of course. - I mean it. - I'm calm as fuck. - Hey, I mean it. Scout's honour. They don't have any coffee. Forget it. I've got a plan. Ah, yeah? You always got a plan. You always expect me to be a part of it, but I'm not Perry, okay? I'm not your fucking lapdog! Look, if you wanna leave, this is the time to go. Really? What about you? I'm still thinking it through. Look, I could get the money. This shit just got a little complicated. Yeah, a little. Look, you're still clean, little brother. Let's keep it that way, okay? Come on, man, you know I need this money too. Does that mean you're with me on this, huh? All the way. All the way. Let's go find it. Jesus. Fucking mess, man. (CLICK) What was that before? Just leave me alone, please. You were gone. Why didn't you run? Nowhere to go. That's not it. There's something else going on. Hmm? What's in there? Vance, just get started. I'm gonna get this room. - Ow. - You gotta be shitting me. So you're telling me you haven't left this house... in over 10 years? (WHISPERING): Yeah. (LAUGHING) Okay. I can just leave this door open. I can go make myself a cup of tea. When I come back... you're still sitting there? That's crazy. (WHIMPERING) Ah, fuck, that's sad. This is actually really sad. (CHIRPING) Hey, you know what? I think I can help you. No, no, no! - No! No!! - Huh? C'mere! Stop, please! Please, please, please! - C'mere! C'mere! - Please stop! Stop! (SCREAMING) (MOANING) No, no, no... (GROANING) (DISTORTED): See? It's not so bad. I got you. I got you. Okay. What the hell did you do? She doesn't go outside. I was just trying to show her. You gonna be okay? (MOANING) Perry, go inside. Hey, I need you to focus. - Let me back in! - Hey, hey, we go back inside, - Perry's gonna kill you. - I don't care. Please!!! Anna. Anna, we looked upstairs and we didn't find anything. Look, is there an attic? Huh? Huh? Safe? Basement? Huh? Huh? Basement? Huh? Basement? Okay. Okay, let's get you back inside. Take her upstairs, get her cleaned up. Well, you had your chance to leave. Look, don't make me regret letting you stay. Fuck. God-fuckin'... Put these on. Hey, you sure you don't want me to look after her? - After what you just pulled? - I'm just saying, do you really think Vance is up for this? He'll be fine. (CREAKING) You gonna tell me what we're doing down here? Trust me, man, we hit the jackpot. (LAUGHING) Yeah... Jackpot. (SOBBING) Uh... what the hell? Oh, you like sitting around in your own pee. Got it. Just change, please. I... I can't. Ahem. (TAPE TEARING) Ouch. Sorry. - (STOMPING) - Fuck! Come over here man. Gimme a hand with this. I'm more curious what's behind door number two. Why's that? No handle. (SNIFFLING) Uh... it can be hard... to be with someone who has such a strong personality. I can tell... you're just going along. I can see it. Don't you fucking shrink me. Ow. Don't think I've dealt with this my entire life? Maybe I was the one who found out about this place. You ever think about that? I mean, maybe this whole thing was my idea? I don't think you realize how serious this is. - No, I do. - You've seen our faces. You know our names. You really think we're just gonna let you go? Now put on the fucking sweatpants! Stop! - Please, stop! - Stop moving, goddammit! - Stop! Stop... - Hey! What the hell?! - Stop it! - Hey! Get the fuck off her! - It's not what it looks like! - What are you doing? - Honestly... - Are you okay? You gotta listen to me! She wasn't supposed to be here. - Listen to me, Danny, please! - Get back! Dan... you guys know each other? Yes, but that's not... - No, no. - Anna, Anna, - I had nothing to do with this. - You cannot be here. - You gotta get out of here, okay? - Oh, shit! - Get back. - You cannot be here, Danny. Honest, if we knew she was gonna be here... - What do you mean, "we"? - Danny boy. Leave him alone, dude! - Don't fucking touch me. - Where is she? Huh? Fuck. - Hey, hey, hey! - What?! Do you know how this has to end? We can't let her go. Just find her. Come on. You like to disappear, don't you? Come out and play, little girl. (KNOCKING) I got a few tricks of my own. (CHIRPING) (KISSING SOUNDS) (FRANTIC CHIRPING) C'mere. For my next trick, I would like to invite my lovely assistant to the stage. Anna, would you be so kind as to join us? I don't think she's coming. It's really too bad. She would've been of great value to us. I guess I'll have to do this on my own. (CHIRPING) (STARTLED YELP) Hey. Perry! - Open wide, Dan. - What the fuck? Stupid thing didn't talk. (CREAKING) - Ah! Oh! - I found her! - You got her? - Yeah, I got her! Get the fuck off there! Please. Don't you understand I'm the least of your fucking worries right now?! Please! (EXCLAIMING) (PANTING) (ANNA WHIMPERING) (GASPING) Come on. He's taking his time. If he loses her, we'll find her. Put out some breadcrumbs, she'll come. (LAUGHING) Come on, man, be serious. Maybe I am. (PERRY): You got her? (RAGGED BREATHING) (THUDDING) You hear that? (THUDDING) Stay. No! No! Vance! Vance!! Vance!!! Vance! Wake up!! Is he dead? Argh... Ah, goddamn. Argh... Ah, Vance. Hey. Hey! Hey, you, open! Open it, you fucking bitch! Open the fucking door! Anna! Anna... - (GROANING) - Come on! (SOBBING) Hello? (ECHOING) Hey, JP, something weird is going on here, man. Come on, we gotta get the fuck outta here. Oh, fuck. You bitch! You fucking bitch!! Get down here! (PANTING) Argh! Fucking bitch! Argh! (KETTLE WHISTLING) (KETTLE WHISTLING) Is she making fucking tea? (LOCK CLICKING) Hey, nothing in here's gonna get us up there. Let's drag this fucking cabinet in there. It's bolted to the wall. - Goddammit! - Doesn't matter. She was behind that fucking door, and then she was up there, like that! The bitch doesn't have wings. (CLICK) Anna! Anna. Help me. Hurry! Cut me loose. Robbing me... during Conrad's funeral? No, no. - They did this, not me! - Then what are you doing here? I... I wanted to be there for you. You... you went? You didn't show. I got worried. Was it... was it nice? It... it was peaceful. Nobody came? No, uh, it was me and... Charlotte and the priest. He gave a good talk. It was... it was really nice. It's okay. You know, it was... just me and him. We only had each other. Do you know you've been bringing us food for almost a year? I checked the calendar. Almost to the day. It feels like longer, doesn't it? A-Anna. Is that how you do it? You go into people's homes and... steal their things and then you call your friends - to go and steal all of it? - They're not my friends! Well... Vance is, but... not the other two. You told him about the money? I... I... I told him about you. I told him about your situation. And, yeah, I told him you tried to give me money. It took me off-guard. I didn't mean... I... I couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't stop thinking about you. You know, I almost believe you this time. Listen to me. I get if you hate me, but you have to believe... I would never hurt you. What happened to you? W-w-why don't you leave the house? I haven't left the house since Daddy died. Whenever I had a problem, I could always ask Connie. Hmm... He always knew how to handle any situation. How would he handle this one? (CRACK) Oh!! (CRACK) Ow!! Ow!! (MOANING) If you meant what you said in there, then you have to trust me. I do. Then you have to jump. No! It'll be much safer if you turn around. - I'm not... I'm not doing that. - None of this would've happened if you would've just taken the money! (MOANING) You're not like this. You have no idea what I'm like. Ah! (SCREAMING) (DANNY CRYING OUT ON TV) (CLATTER AND SCREAMING) You don't know me. Help me! - What the fuck are you doing?! - Hey! Shut up! Fuck, man. Fuck... Please help. - (MOANING) - Alright, fine. Fuckin' let me take a look at it. Oh... Caref... Ow. (GROANING) Careful, careful... Ow. - Oh. - What, is it bad? Fuck, it's bad. Kneecap's dislocated. Fuck. Okay... I'm gonna have to pop it back into place before the swelling is too bad I won't be able to, okay? - Dan. - Huh? It's gonna hurt. Oh... JP. Hey! JP. Hold his body down. Hold him down here. Three, two... (CRACK) (SCREAMING) (CRYING OUT, THEN GROANING) That was kinda fun. (MOANING) You're alright. Thank you. Whatever. Vance? Vance! - He's dead. Shut the fuck up! - Hey, let it go. Let it go? We had her until this shitheel showed up. I said we should do this just us. You didn't want to. I said take care of that bitch. You said no. Now we're stuck in a fucking basement with one live piece of shit and one dead one! Fuck you! Get a hold of yourself. I'm a hold! I'm a hold of my fucking self! Just re-evaluate your fucking priorities, okay, JP? I'm not the one who's slipping. (CREAKING) (DANNY SNIFFLING) JP. JP! J... JP? - Are you okay? - I... I... I need to go to a hospital. I can't... I can't take you to the hospital. - No kidding. - You can't even check your fucking mail, you psycho bitch. - Don't call me that. - What? Psycho, or bitch? We could all stop this. Let's all stop, okay? Are you retarded?! She's not gonna come down here and fucking save you, Dan! Can't you get him under control? No one fucking controls me, do you understand?! Okay... That's what you get! (DANNY SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) I'm cool. I'm okay, JP. - (GROANING) - Just breathe. - (MOANING) - There's a first-aid kit. - So go get it. - No. - Down there. - It's locked. Try again. (DANNY MOANING) Don't go anywhere. Oh, fuck! Hey, open this stupid door! What's in there? (JP): What the fuck?! (LAUGHING) Ah... (MUFFLED SHOUTING) Perry! Goddamn! (WHISPERING): What the fuck? (RATTLING) (RATTLING) (MUTTERING) (RATTLING) Fucking bitch! (MUFFLED): Get me outta here! (SIGHING) (THUD) Hello? Can you guys hear me? Yo, Perry, are you there? - Aren't you gonna do something? - Oh... like what? Get him outta there. Get him outta there... Why didn't I think of that? I should've thought of that. God, what a fucking idiot. What an idiot. Okay, here we go. We're just gonna get him outta there. You just stay seated, you fucking cripple. JP, come on out! Come on, buddy. Huh. Quit fucking around. Get me the fuck outta here! The door seems to be locked. Do you remember when that happened? - What's going on out there?! - Forget it. Is that probably when the door closed? Did you hear the locking mechanism? Hmm... (THUDDING) Yeah. This'll do. (GRUNTING) Come on, big fella. Goddamn, you fat fuck. What are you doing? Putting him in the doorway. What's it look like? He's my friend. He was your friend. Now, he's a doorstop. (TAPPING) - Hmm? - Ah... (THUMP) Fuck. (BANG) - (GRUNTING) - Fuck you! (PANTING) Fuck. Hey... JP. We're gonna get you out. Perry's looking for something. He won't find anything. (THUDDING) He might. (POUNDING) (PERRY): Open it, you fucking nutty cunt! Dan... listen to me. You know she's not gonna let us go. Can you blame her? You were gonna kill her an hour ago. Come on. I was just playing. Look where it got you. (THUDDING) JP! She's gonna pay for it. (CLANGING) (LAUGHTER) Fuck this. JP? (MUFFLED): JP? JP, I think I'm on the other side of you. Can you hear me? There's a fucking noose in here. Hey, Perry! Can you hear me? Fuck. (GRUNTING) (CLANGING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (LAUGHING) Nice one. (ROARING) (GRUNTING) (GASPING) - (CREAKING) - Hello? Anna? Hello? (DISTANTLY): Anna? Hello? (GLASS CRUNCHING UNDERFOOT) Is everything okay? Everything's fine. Are you okay? Just... just a little accident. Is that Dan's car out front? Oh! Dan came to check on me because I wasn't at the funeral. So he broke in? I didn't answer the door, and he was worried I was gonna do something bad. Is there something going on between you two? - What? No. - I knew there was something. I saw it the other day when he came over. Well, I-I've just been so, um, lonely since Conrad got sick and I... Oh, shhh. Honey, it's okay. Hey, you're going through a rough time. You've done nothing wrong. And if you can't believe that, you know what you need to do? No. Forgive yourself. Come here. I'll try. (MUTTERING) I'll call you in a few days just to see how you're doing. (GRUNTING) That's nice, thanks. - (THUDDING AND MUFFLED SHOUTING) - What is that? (THUDDING AND MUFFLED SHOUTING) Radiator. (MUFFLED): Help! It's... an old house. (THUDDING) Dan's taking a look at it for me. Oh. So sweet. I'll talk to you soon, okay? (CRICKETS CHIRRING) (BANGING) (WHIRRING) (RAGGED BREATHING) You're in a lot of pain, aren't you? Come on, I'll help you. (GRUNTING AND PANTING) What'd you do? Have a seat. Now lift your legs up. - Please... - Now. (MOANING) You'll understand soon. What the fuck? (DANNY GROANING) Fuck! Fuck! God! Argh! Girly-girl! You sneaky little fuck! Argh! Fuck! I didn't know you were invited, Dan. Perry's dead. There's a body in the freezer. Yeah... You could tell me there's a unicorn in the attic, I wouldn't be surprised. What is this place? Fucked up, right? I mean, there's another one like it upstairs. Why would you make... the exact... bedroom? Are you back there, Anna? You watching us? Fu... (PANTING) We're your zoo animals now? Huh? You gonna observe us in captivity? Fuck. Argh! - Take it easy. - Fuck! (ANNA): You can't break it. It's bulletproof. You... There's a shirt in the dresser. Put it on. You know, something tells me we're not your first guests here. You're sitting behind your little desk, aren't you? - Huh? - No. What's your game, huh? Who do you watch back there? What do you do? Put on the shirt. What do you do, huh? Daddy issues? - Just put on the shirt. - Or else what? - Conrad will come. - Conrad's the dead guy? You're making it worse. Anna? Anna, please open the door. Not yet. Not until he puts on the shirt. Fine! I'll put your shirt on. I'll play your game. We're gonna figure this out, Anna. You wanna start? No?! Fine. I like puzzles. So you trap some poor fuck in here... Conrad sneaks through here. Yeah? Fucking airlock? And he kills them. Hmm. Alright. Simple enough, right? Just stop. But if Conrad wants to kill these guys, why's he put them in here first? So you could talk to them. I... I didn't talk to them. So it's Conrad, then, huh? What does he say? No, no, no, no, wrong question. What does he want from them? That's the question. And what did he do when he didn't get what he wants? Hey, you hungry? Fuck you. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no... Perry said there's a noose in the other room. You drugged their food. Then Conrad came in, drug them out... and he strung them up. Stop talking. You know what? I hate to break it to you, darling, but there's no one coming through that door tonight. - Conrad's gone. - Shut up! You're twisting it around and you're... making it sound all wrong! But... but it's true? You watched Conrad kill people? So what? Supposed to absolve you? Wh-wh-what is it? They were killing perverts. We weren't doing a bad thing. You have to believe me. Murder's murder. No! We were fixing them! Is that what you'd tell yourselves? It's the truth! They needed our help. They were sick, just like Daddy was. He said he loved me all along, but... that didn't stop him from doing what he did to me. It wasn't so bad after a while, 'cause he would hold me afterwards and... Conrad stopped him? Yeah, he saved me. He wrapped the sheet around father's neck and he pulled it so tight! When it was all over, Connie looked at me and I knew. I knew he would never hurt me. That he loved me. That's when you stopped leaving the house, yeah? And he built this room to punish fucking pedophiles like your dad. Ah, I saw some twisted fucking shit, but this... Pfft, you must be really proud of yourself. No, I would've stopped, but they didn't show me - they were sorry! - How would they do that? Buy you flowers? Dear Anna, so sorry to let you down. - Yours truly, your stand-in dad. - Stop. So pleased I got to join you in your beautiful basement so we could help you erase the feeling of Daddy between your legs. - Stop... - Your brother was a sick fuck! He got his rocks off killing your dad, and he wanted to relive the moment over and over again. - That's not true. - Little crazy sister, little Anna, too scared to leave, too dumb... - No! - Shut the fuck up! Just stop! Oh, I'm sorry, Dan. Sorry to mess with your girl. (SIGHING) Dan. Hmm...? Come to the mirror. What do you want? I want him to pay. Oh... Okay, he's dead, Anna. Okay? He's been dead for a long time. No. Him. Do it. Do what now? I'll let you go. No. Please? I'm not like them. Just do it! Now dammit, Dan! This is how? This is how they show you they're sorry? So much regret, so much remorse, that they just... bang. They were supposed to take responsibility for what they did! Just like you. Don't you feel sorry for what you did? Big brothers are supposed to protect their younger siblings, which is more than you did for Vance. - Stop talking about him. - You know it's your fault! - Shut your mouth. - You knew he looked up to you. You ever wonder if things would've turned out differently if only... I know what you're trying to do. It doesn't change the truth. I could let you go right now, and there's nowhere you could go to get away from what you did. (SNIFFLING) - (SOBBING) - I'm sorry! Good. That's good. Now... now show me. (SOBBING) - Oh... - Show me you're sorry. Show me. You think I'm that weak? (LAUGHING) I'd live a thousand years with this on my shoulders before I pull this trigger. You will... eventually. One bullet for one man. No! What... what... what are you doing? I found my way out. You killed Vance, - you killed Perry... - Fuck. But you're still alive, Dan. That doesn't mean anything! Ah, let's see. (MOANING) - Argh...! - Mm! Please. No, no! Please stop! Please don't hurt him. (DAN GROANING) (DAN PANTING) Fuck. Come on. Alright, brother, come on. No. Fucking... burn this house down. Burn his fucking memories. Burn his fucking fucked-up family. Ah! (MUTTERING) all fucking locked up. I let you go. Uh, yeah, guess that was a mistake. This is what you wanted, isn't it? It was. Now I just wanna see you burn. (GRUNTING) Argh!! Fuck! Fuck! Bitch. Huh? C'mere. C'mere. C'mon. Ah!! (GLASS BREAKING) Ah!!! Ah! I've got an idea. - (ANNA WHIMPERING) - Ah! Ah! Ah! No! Don't! No! Don't! Ah! Ah!! One last walk down memory lane. Hold still! I'll give it to you like Daddy did, just like Papa. Be a good little girl. It'll be over soon. Hold still, Daddy's little girl. Little angel. Yeah, that's it, just lie there, you broken little bitch. Hey! Stop! Ah! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop! This won't bring Vance back! No more killing. (CLICK) I forgive you.
