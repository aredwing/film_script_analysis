Shouldn't be a problem. What number? Um, 423. I'll have your train in two weeks. Uh, okay. Hi. Hey. You forget something? N-No. [ Boy ] Hike. Hike. All right. Nice going, man. [ Kids Laughing ] Hey, buddy, where's Snow White? Grumpy or Sleepy over there, huh? [ Chuckles ] [ Man ] Lorraine, look. [ Lorraine ] He's gonna hear you. [ Chuckling Softly ] Miss. Paper or plastic? - Paper, please. - Sorry. I didn't see you. Cash or charge? Cash. Who's showing the movie tonight? Carl. [ Man ] The billowing smoke as it's coming forward. My wife was inside the car, staying warm, but I-I was on the hood. There's, uh, people standing by here as it's, uh, going by. The traffic, of course, was stopped... to, uh, allow the train-- Oh. Now h-here I was hanging out, shooting this in, uh, Canada. It's Canada. It's cold. Snow. The scenery was, uh, really spectacular. See, because the train is moving forward, the smoke is coming back. It was not extremely windy, but the smoke did billow. And, oh, we're about to go into a tunnel. Yeah. We're in a tunnel for about a minute. It got colder when we were in the tunnel. It was, uh-- It was one of the darker tunnels in Canada. [ Horn Honks ] [ Rhythmic Clattering ] [ Clattering Intensifies ] Lunch. [ Loud Thud ] [ Horn Honks ] He was a nice man. He was a nice man. I don't-- I don't think we've ever met. No, but I've seen you around. [ Stutters ] You're one of those memorable people. Uh, I brought you down here to discuss your inheritance. In his will, Henry bequeathed to you some property... in Newfoundland, New Jersey. It's about half an acre of land. It's got an old train depot on it. I have an appraisal of the property for your records. What's happening with the shop? Well, the building's been sold. Golden Spike will be closed and the inventory liquidated. This is all, of course, in accordance with the terms I drew up in Henry's will. How soon? If everything goes as planned, no hitches, anything, a thing like this takes about six weeks. Uh, I have some preliminary paperwork for you to sign. Some other papers are being drawn up. We have the keys to the depot. You ever been out to this part of New Jersey? No. Uh, I drove through it once. Let me tell you-- I mean, it's pretty, but-- I mean, there's nothin' out there. Nothin'. [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Rain Splashing ] [ Insects Buzzing ] [ Birds Chirping ] [ Rustling ] [ Man ] Then where'd you go? Nice. Thank you. Huh. So, what else, dude? Huh. Andy, man, why don't you come out here, bro? I'm going out of my mind. Holy shit. Hey, let me call you back. Bye. Wow. How you doing? Fine. Do you sell coffee? Caf con leche. It's the house special. You'll love it. Trust me. Okay. I also got hot dogs and muffins. You live around here? Yeah. Never seen you around. Where you from? - Hoboken. - No shit? I live in Manhattan, dude. So, why are you out here? Work? Family? - Just-- - How much do I owe you for the coffee? O-Oh, shit. Sorry, man. It's a buck. Is there a convenience store nearby? Uh, yeah. Down the road about a mile and a half, on the right. This is my pop's truck, by the way. He's sick. That's why I'm out here. He can't get out of bed, so I'm taking care of this shit for him. I've been here for six weeks. It's driving me crazy. Thanks. Hey, I'm here every day from 7:00 to 3:00. I'm Joe Oramas. What's your name? - Fin. - Fin? - Yeah. - Cool. Hey, you-- Your place around here? Yeah. No shit. Oh-- Ah! [ Softly ] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Just stay there. Don't move. Don't-Don't-- Don't try to get up. [ Grunts ] Oh, I'm so sorry.

Well, that's- that's great. Yeah. He's an interesting guy. Actually, he's a little guy. Shit. [ Clears Throat ] Uh, is that it? Uh, two packs of Drum, and, uh, some beef jerky. Help yourself to the jerky. Oh, shit. There he is. Ow! Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh. Oh. Oh. [ Gasping ] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't believe this. I can't-- I'm so sorry. Here. Stay. [ Panting ] I-I saw you. I-I tried to put my caf con lech down, and it spilled... all over my ass, and it burned me very bad, so I swerved. I-- Can I at least give you a ride back to your train station? The hot dog guy told me where you lived. No. I'm fine. You're sure? Yes. You're fine. You're-- I-- Ow. Yeah? She ask about me? What did you tell her? Don't fuckin' tell her that. I don't know. Make some shit up. Hey, I'll call you back. Bye. Hey, Fin. Bro, you live here? Yes. Wow, we're neighbors. Nice. Hey, what happened to you? Nothing. Listen, uh, you want to go down to the Mill and grab a beer later? No, thanks. What, you don't drink? I do. Well, you just don't want to have a drink with me? I don't like bars very much. Oh. Hey, well, how about I go get a six, and we can have it right here? No, thanks. Well, what are you gonna do? I'm, uh, I'm going for a walk. Oh. Cool. Well, you mind if I come along, man? I need the exercise. I'm turning into a fat shit out here. I usually go alone. I'm a good walker, bro. I prefer to go alone. Okay. All right, maybe next time, right? You know where to find me. Hi. [ Insects Buzzing ] [ Knocking ] [ Knocking ] [ Object Clatters ] You're safe. No car. I-I never told you my name. Olivia Harris. Uh, this is for you. A sort of, uh, housewarming... slash-sorry-I-ran-you- off-the-road gift. Oh, thank you. It's dark. Do-Do you have any glasses? Or we could just swig from the bottle. I have mugs. Oh. [ Wine Pouring ] When I was 19, I actually slept with a guy... because he rolled his own cigarettes. [ Soft Chuckling ] [ Wine Pouring ] Cheers. Y-You never told me your name. Fin. Oh, that's a good name. [ Phone Rings ] You can get that if you want. My phone's disconnected. Oh, shit. It's mine. I always forget I have this thing. My husband gave it to me in case of an emergency. Although he's not my husband right now. We're separated. You don't have a phone? No. I love that. I hate phones. I have two. Never answer either of them. How'd you find this place? - I inherited it. - It's very nice. Oh. I love this. What is this? - It's an old ticket box. - Oh, look at this little drawer. - Careful. That doesn't-- - Ah! [ Clattering ] Oh-- Oh, God. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Oh! Can I sit here for a moment? [ Sighs ] Who left you this place? My friend, Henry. - When did he die? - Three weeks ago. I'm sorry. My son Sam died. Two years ago. Would you mind not looking at me right now? [ Birds Chirping ] Shit. [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Joe ] Olivia! You miss your train last night? [ Knocking ] [ Knocking Continues ] Hey. Brought you a caf con leche. Thanks. Whoa. So, what happened? What do you mean? I been here for six weeks, I don't get two words out of her. You're here 24 hours, it's sleepover time? She brought me a bottle of bourbon. Are you serious? [ Phone Ringing ] - You should get that. It's probably her. - My phone's disconnected. Something's ringing. She left her phone. Sweet. So, what happened? [ Horn Honks ] Fuck. Be right back. [ Man ] Yo! Hold on! Come on, man. You gotta tell me what happened. You're not going anywhere today, are you? I'd like to return this. Do you know where she lives? If I were you, I'd freeze her out, but that's just me. You're very lucky, bro. She's a pretty woman. You know, she got that sexy, smart older-woman thing going. It's nice. Do you know where she lives? She's on Green Pond Road. Three miles down the road, on the right. Hey, listen.

Hey, Fin, let me ask you a question. What do you think of Amtrak? I don't know. I've never ridden on Amtrak. You've never ridden an Amtrak train? No. That's weird, right? I thought that's what you train guys did. You ride trains. How-How's your dad, Joe? Well, he's driving me nuts, but he's better. Thanks. [ Pans Clanking ] Chuleta con cibolla con arroz con frijoles.

[ Sighs ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Continues ] Uh, what-what kind of movies? Well, there are people called "train chasers." They follow a train, and they film it. Are you a train chaser? No. How come? I don't know how to drive a car, and I don't own a camera. That would do it. I gotta split. - You're leaving? - Yeah. It's my dad. He can't find his medication.

No. It stops right down there. Thank you. I'm starving. Want some beef jerky? Absolutely. You had it all this time? - Want some? - I'll pass. This is fuckin' delicious. Let me have a piece. Fuckin' good. It's so beefy. This is good. That was a good walk. [ Sighs ] Why is it called "walking the right-of-way"? It's complicated. You know, it's uh-- [ Laughing Loudly ] I'll let Fin answer this one. Fin? When the railroads were being built, the government took a lot of private land, saying the railroad needed the right-of-way through the property. Hey, can we get some sodas? [ Joe ] We're closed. I'll play soccer with you though. [ Laughing ] He does enjoy life. You guys want to play? Daddy. [ Giggling, Laughing ] Whoa-oh-oh. Ooh. Oh, Jesus. You okay? Uh, I'm gonna-- I've got-- I'm gonna go.

About what? Um-- Being a dwarf. You know, it's-- It's, uh-- It's really funny... how different people... see me and treat me. Because I'm actually just a very simple, boring person. What about you? Are you still in love with David? Yes. I don't think he's moving. I'll wake him. No, you're not gonna have any luck. Maybe I should go. No. No. You're not leaving. You're both staying here, and don't argue... because I'm just too tired. Would you like some water? Um, no. I'm all right. Thanks. You can get under the covers. No. I'm fine. I brought you some water anyway. And, uh, a towel. That's Sam, huh? Yeah. He fell off the monkey bars. I turned my head for a second. Looks like a happy kid. He was. Well, good night. Good night.

Olivia, can you listen to me? [ Cleo ] Fin! Here, Fin. It's a permission slip so you can speak at my school. I can't speak at your school, Cleo. Yes, you can. You can pick any Friday that you want. I'm sorry. I can't. Why? It's just not something that I can do. You have to. I'm sorry. But I already told everyone you were coming. I'm sorry, Cleo. No, you're not. If you were sorry, then you would come. What was that all about? I guess no coffee for Olivia today. No. Guess not. I didn't like that guy, man. Who? Olivia's ex. Uptight white guy. Can I ask you a personal question? Sure. You've had sex, right? Yes. With a regular-sized chick? Yeah. With a regular-sized chick. You ever had it with someone your own size? No. Do you wanna?

It's really nice right now, but-- Where do you sleep? Couch. Oh. So, I just wanted to come by and say I'm sorry. Chris can be such an asshole when he gets angry like that, but he's really not a bad guy. It's just-- God, it's so nice and quiet in here. Everybody's freaking out at my house about me being pregnant. I live at home. I was gonna move in with Chris, but-- So, did the conductor guy used to live here? No. The conductor worked on the train. The station agent worked in here. Doing what? A lot of things. The train brought in the mail, and the agent delivered it. They sold groceries. They cut hair. Really? Yeah. Are you gonna open a salon? I'm retired actually. Aren't you a little young to be retired? No. Dwarves retire early. Common fact. Yeah, lazy dwarves. Can I stay here tonight? Just sleep. [ Engine Starts ] [ Cleo ] Hey, Fin. Is that your girlfriend? No. Is that other woman your girlfriend? You mean Olivia? Mm-hmm. No. I liked her. Yeah. Me too. When is she coming back? I don't know. [ Train Passing ] [ Olivia, Indistinct ] What? There is nothing. There is nothing. You have-- You have no right to say that. You just show up, and you tell me this? I've known you for 17 years. You've known me 17 fuckin years, and you don't-- You have no clue? No, David. What? What would be-- What could be more important than this? What? How could you do this? Just go to hell. [ Handset Rattles ] Olivia. Go away. Are you okay? I don't want you here, Fin. Go away. Please, Olivia, just-- Look. I'm not your fucking girlfriend or your mother, all right? I know that. Are you all right? You're not a child! Get off the fucking porch and leave me alone! [ Door Slams ] [ Loud Chatter ] [ Rock ] Lay me down And let me die It's just you and me [ Continues, Indistinct ] Two. Down and slow. [ Continues ] [ Continues, Distorted ] How you doing? [ Continues, Indistinct ] [ Loud Clattering ] [ People Exclaiming ] Here I am. Take a look. Take a look! Lay me down And let me die [ Continues, Indistinct ] Oh. Oh. [ Train Whistle Blowing In Distance ] [ Train Approaching, Whistle Blowing ] [ Birds Chirping ] [ Groans ] Olivia? Olivia? Olivia? Did you take these? [ Grunts ] He's having another baby. Did you take all of these? Oh, gosh. I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha. Come on, come on. Oh, God, Fin. [ Breathing Heavily ] I want-- [ Sobbing ] I want-- I want Sam back. I want him back. Oh, God. I want him back. [ Woman On P.A., Indistinct ] [ Door Opens ] [ Woman ] You can come in now, Mr. McBride. [ Scattered Laughter ] Everyone, I want you to give Mr. McBride your full attention. I am here to speak about trains. The first real train in this country... was built by Peter Cooper in 1829. Does anyone know what it was called? It was called the Tom Thumb. [ Students Giggling ] Since that time, trains have helped make this country what it is today. A long time ago, most people never left their towns... because travel was hard. Yes? How tall are you? Jacob. I'm, uh-- I'm four feet and five inches tall. [ Snickers ] I'm taller than you. Jacob, come with me. I'm so sorry. Be back in a minute. You're such a jerk. [ Door Closes ] What about blimps? I think blimps came later. When? I'm not sure exactly. - Blimps are cool. - Well, so are trains. Yeah. Well, they're-- they're both cool. Trains and blimps. [ Crickets Chirping ] Anybody hungry for dessert? I'm stuffed. Yeah. Me too. Well, there's plenty of food. We can have it for lunch tomorrow. Hey, when were blimps invented? I have no idea. Yeah, me neither. You know, you can go down to the library and ask that little hottie. She is cute. It's the librarian fantasy, man. Glasses off, hair down. Books flying. She doesn't wear glasses. Well, buy her some. It's worth it. [ Chuckles ]
