But all who vaum' themselves at me, hay by the heels-.. And the truth of this I will now show. Do not hear me. Feel me are you prepared? Awaken we are to celebrate smile do you recall? It matters not hi... Hi. when a door opens i another one closes don't be afraid... It is all for the best, is it not? How are you? How are you? I'm better. And you? Absorbed. I was quite busy these days, but I don't complain. Correct I was quite busy these days, but I don't complain. 'With the movie? Yes 'with the movie? Yes how is it going? It is coming along it's coming along. We are ready to start. I will be traveling abroad as well. How beautiful to travel... - Have you been here long? - No. I haven't seen you at all. I'll start stumbling any moment now. Have you been working for long? You don't want to know. What can I get you? One Hellenic coffee for me. And one espresso, decaf. Yours? At home. Congratulations for quitting. I started again. You've lost weight. Really? Too much. In any case. I had put on weight. How are your folks? I haven't really seen them. I'm waiting. Yes. I'll tell it to you straight. I don't know how else to say it... I don't want us to be together anymore. Why? I am in love. One Hellenic, one espresso. Decaf right? Wait... Since when? Do I know him? You've seen him one night we went to the movies. Did you do it? No. We just kissed. Decaffeinated why? I don't know... It's been some time since I don't feel right... Without blaming you for something. Every day I feel more uncomfortable... With me, with my life. With everything. I am motionless. And you found that what moves you. This "something" that... I don't have something to say to you. And clearly I won't try to change your mind. You've made your decision. Understand me. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know where I'm going. I am confused. How can I be with you when I am like this? I will leave now. What is wrong... We belong to a different myth. Which myth? What is this bullshit 7 I said what crap is this you're watching? Nerea please lower the TV, you 're destroying my brains with this stupid story. What are those two supposed to be? A couple? She goes and tells him... "Darling, you know how love is... I'm in love with another man. " And this jerk listens to her. As if he heard that the price of milk went up. And what's even better, the guy gets up and leaves without even smacking her in the face. This doesn't happen in real life... And if it does it's a load of crap. Like this one. What? I'm just saying these things don't happen in real life, that's all. Is this love? They are like kids. They see something shinning and they go for it. And the guy?! He got really upset... Right! What's wrong love? Are you in love with another man? Well have a coffee if that's the case. What has this guy invested in his relationship? Nothing! Pays for the coffees and leaves. That's fuckin' great! Well, I'm off... I'm wasted... If we close early, will you give me a massage when I get home? Calm down what is it? It's nothing. Go back to sleep. Just a bad dream go back to sleep. Just a bad dream. Are you up? Look what the wind brought us. I'm in love! Can you give me a pack of fortuna and a lighter please? And this magazine. Do you recall? Gloucester! Attend the lords of France and burgundy I shall my liege how is this called? Plaza del tripi what's that? From the acid? Officially it's called Plaza de George orwell. Because orwell lived here for a while, but everyone calls it Plaza del tripi because in the old days it was the hot spot to make a score. It still is, but they've cleaned it up a bit. European union you know... Obama you know... From what I see, the city becomes more and more European, in the bad sense. It's like turning from indie to Hollywood in a way... Why did you take the umbrella with you? So, guys, I continue with my music trip. I play the guitar in these streets. So we might bump into each other later. Take care, have a good time and don't burn anything! What was that? This kiss, if it durst speak... Would stretch thy spirits up into the air... Conceive, and fare thee well and Edmund replies... Yours in the ranks of death patroklos, face it! She is not available, find someone else... You keep doing the same thing! I don't see them together for much longer though. One here, the other there. What kind of relationship is that? You can never know from the outside. Do you imagine being together in the film? I don't think about it. If it's written it will happen. - I meant her. - Why? Is she going to be in the film as well? - Yes. Didn't I tell you? - No. Do you know something more? What? About the film? Only what you already know. I can see you do know a bit more... Let me get her a Spanish fan. What for? She likes them? Beats me. But since we're in Spain, it seems like a good present. We are in Catalonia, not Spain. Now that I think about it. I haven't met any catalan yet. Everybody is from another place. As if a wave brought them here. A city of castaways. - How do you like this one? - It's ok. This one. How much? and this one? How much is it? What? How much is yours? Let's go. How do they open it with a single movement? Here, let me try. I think I got it. Good he called you. You told him a have a boyfriend. No. He called me out of the blue. I didn't hear him well. He sounded ok, but I know him. He is not ok. I think he wants to return. And you? And me what? It doesn't make sense anymore. The place where he expects to return to. No longer exists. And besides, I'm not alone anymore. What's the matter nerea? I am not in the mood. I'll get over it. Nerea... you are not talking with Hector. You are talking with me. I come here telling you that he called me after two years... And you take it as if nothing happened... As if you were hypnotized. You keep yourself locked up in here. Becoming one with the sofa. Your ass will become enormous... It's just a phase if it was just a phase you would be over it long ago this isn't just a phase- this is something chronic nerea, break up! It's not that simple. Why is it not that simple? What do you have? Children? Loans? A shitty life in a shitty house. That's what you have. I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you. I'm just trying to let you know what's happening to you. One good fuck is all you need... To see it's all way too simple than you think. Where is that? Escudellers street and I haven't slept at all... Straight to the airport from rehearsal. Travelling since dawn... Walking around all day... It's eleven thirty, it's not early. We've been on the road all day long. I am not going home now. The crazy serbs are having a party at home... Listen... one drink. One drink and that's it. Eciuz me? Yu know bar trece? Are you Greek? Yes! You 're Greek too! Incredible. Hi. Was the picture good? I was just fooling around. My film ran out. - Where are you going? - As if we knew... They told us about a bar trece but I can't find it. Do you know it? Man, where is the bar trece? You go that way, turn left at calle d'avignon and then on your left hand side you... Let's go together. We were headed that way, anyway. Prepare one tapa, let's go! Whatever, doesn't matter... Are we in extra-time? Yes. They want another bottle. Bloody tourists! What the hell are they still talking about? They are in love... I also was in love talia. But I didn't close the restaurants. I was going to the park. Or in the car... Or a house if I was lucky, and not here breaking balls. Spoiled brats! What I should do is open them a can of mussels to mess up this great wine. But they are such beasts that they wouldn't be able to tell the difference... Between a can of mussels and the best sirloin I have here. Talia, put out the cigarette please. What a square you are. Leave me alone will you? We're here waiting for this clown to decide to take her home... So we could go to ours. It doesn't even occur to them that there are people here working. Yes... but I don't think they are thinking about that right now. Well they should. What they should do. Is go directly to bed... And leave all this bla bla aside. If you want to chat take her for a durum in the rambla de raval that's open all night long. "And haw a biutiful boy like yu no have girl?" "So I kan be here now love!" For fuck's sake man I while they are playing with the food as if it was baby cream. How long have you been here? What? You don't even rem ember when I came? Of course I rem ember. In Barcelona. Two years. And why did you come? I don't know. I guess a wave brought me. Another castaway, right? From where did it bring you? From something I'd rather forget. And you? A wave brought me as well. Four years ago. Are you about to say something romantic and declare your love now? Take it easy eh! I came here because I wanted to become the best. All the great chefs are here. Sergi, arola, roca... everyone! Everyone is here. Barcelona is the capital of creative cooking... And I had to be where the shots were called. So I packed my bags, lefi my Madrid. And I came here. And here I am chef right? Fuckin' great! Look where I work talia. Just look. I have to do everything in a shitty restaurant. I assure you sergi would never work in a place like this. But I do. I don't have another option if I want to keep the cash owing, because if not... So now I can only wait for this jerk to finish his show... So I can go home in the night bus... Like a don-nobody. This is not what's really bothering you. It stopped... yes. This is how the weather is like in Barcelona. They say, yesterday people were swimming. Yes, I heard that too. Listen, about the square you asked me before... It's called Plaza del tripi. From the acid. You're joking normally it's called... \/wde because 'wilde used to live here \/wde? Oscar 'wilde in Barcelona? Yes- I think he wrote some of his books here in Spain. These little alleys are so beautiful. Anyway, it's a little bit like plaka in Athens. - What do you do? - I am an actor. Theatre? Mainly theatre... nothing is by chance mainly theatre... Nothing is by chance nor life or death nothing is by chance nor to love you or to hate you nothing is by chance nor to love you or to loose you nothing is by chance getting to meet you and not to know you when the road blinds me... I can only wait... Because travelling is one thing... And wandering about is another. Steps both firm and strong... Always forward, never back... They'll bring you at my place... Where I'm waiting to meet you. In every place, I'm looking for you... Whithout ever finding you... On vacation? Yes. Athens, right? Yes Athens. And you? I live here now. Patroklos came today for a small visit. - 'Will you stay for long? - Five days... five days is nothing. How is it here? Very nice. This is what I was telling him before. Life here is much better. The people? Very nice. Very open. To the point of being annoying at times. And the women? Well, surely they don't look like Greek women. And what do Greek women look like? This is what Greek women are like. And from what I see now. This picture should read "come inside". Excuse me? You stand covering the sign, so it reads entra instead of entrada. Which means come in... A window saying come in". Very easy. This is where I want a picture. And what does this photo say? "The sting" now I will take your picture. And this one will say "I ought to" what's your name? Phaedra what? Do you know what my name is? What? Hippolytos? Yes what's happening? Are we going or are we staying here? Let's go. Let's go don't you have anything to say to me anymore? What do you mean? What's wrong? Women... You're all crazy. What the hell's the matter with you? Nothing. So why can't you leave me be for a moment? What is it you are short of? Do you love me? This is unbelievable. Do you think it's possible I don't love you? Why would I be here if I didn't love you? What am I doing here with you then? I am up to my neck in the shit so you can live like a Queen. What more proof do you want? Why won't you touch me anymore? I have a lot in my mind. And I don't? We men are different. In what? What the hell do you want to know? Should a woman make a move on you... Where would you take it? Very high. For sure. It was an incredible scholarship. I had just finished my practice in the "sergi", you know it? And out of 600 applicants. They choose me. Imagine I to work in the best European restaurants for a whole year...! France, Italy, Belgium. Even as a scholar, but it was... Like touching a dream with the fingertips. Crazy! I met nerea and I thought... How can I go away for a year and loose this woman? I fold! She is my inspiration. 'With her on my side I don't need anything I'm in Barcelona damn it! I've already cut a Mountain of onions in the "sergi"... There's sea here, sun, and I'm in love... fuck it I I said back then... Decision. Right. So why don't you leave all this now? You are alone right? Yes. You wouldn't understand. You don't let go. Do you think I don't let go? Yes. I think you don't let go. And you? Do you? Does it seem I don't? And I have another thing to tell you. It's been 13 minutes I'm waiting. To you. To you. What a dead toast. Don't tell me how to toast. You won't escape this easily. Have you gone out since the day I came to your place? No. Why? What are you supposed to be? His pet? Is this the reason you came to Barcelona? To abandon dancing and your old life. Only to become a pet? You could have done the same in Madrid as easily. I'm sorry, I'm sore. He's been calling me again. Everyday. Sometimes, twice a day. He upsets me. I don't know why. But he upsets me. Why don't you talk with him? Girls! A shot from me. By the way, I am Apollo. Nice to meet you. Ariadna. Where are you from? - Where are you from? - Venezuela. And what are you doing here? Well, for the time being I serve shots while I try not to loose myself... In the eyes of beautiful women, like yourselves. No... Seriously... I'm an actor... So just like everyone else. Looking around. Let's say that some time ago... I realised I wasn't in the right place for what I really wanted to do... And that I wouldn't conform to my country's soap operas... So I packed my bags and here I am. Breaking bottles and playing the interesting guy. And you? How did you end up here? You tell me...! I came to Barcelona four years ago, or, better said, I escaped to Barcelona four years ago... For reasons that are none of your business. And since then I am listening to everyone's stories... About how they all ended up in this city. Maybe I'll write a book someday. Well, if you do write it... I buy it. Excuse me... One red wine for me... What will you have? And one Tequila with ice. Take it easy because the Tequila is not for girls, eh?! What was that? Nothing. Trying to be funny... - What will you have? - A beer. So, for the premiere and then for the shows, I won't have invitations. But for the general rehearsal I could hook you up. I am not sure. I have a conference. Anyway, you could give me your number and we can arrange. Yeah, we'll see... Do I know you from television? No... no, I'm not on television. I don't want to. Why? Well you know... Television actors... To you... To you... to us... To us... And how do they call you? Hippolytos? Yes, why? Very unusual. Yes, I know. It was to me also. But with time. I like it more and more. What do you do? I'm an actor. Theatre mainly and some film every now and then. It's been a while since I went to the theatre. Where would you like to make a movie? In many places. Everywhere! In fact they offered me a part in... Anyway, let's first see if it gets made. Everywhere. I hope it does. We'll see. And you? Photographer. Photographer! I like photography a lot. Maybe at some point in the future. For the time being. I do something completely different. What? To the future... To the future... Hippolytos... What were your parents thinking when they named you like this? Of phaedra? Do you remember now? Where have you been? I drank so I slept at ariadna's. And how was it? Good? How come you drank? They were buying us shots. You don't drink. I used to. Do you think I am an idiot? A complete asshole? Because if that's the case I would like to know. Shut up! You don't pay any attention to me. I am invisible! What am Ifor you? A little toy you caged in here... Trying to make it become like your fantasy. And if this little toy reminds you it exists, the man inside you revolts, and then you take interest in me. But how do you do that? As if some neighbour wanted to steal a couple of square meters of your property. I'm not your property. I'm not your fantasy my fantasy? What fantasy? I haven't locked you up in the fuckin' house. What I always wanted, was for you to do what you wanted, and not the clown! I wanted you to be a dancer... Not a telephone operator. "All our lines are busy at the moment, if you could" let's stop shouting and speak with calm. I don't want to speak about anything anymore. Fine, let's not speak. Let's go for a walk. We are asphyxiating in here. I will call at work and tell them I'm not going. I'm taking the day off. They won't say anything. As if they could... It's me that makes them a favour and not the other way around. Of course they don't have to provide for a family. Papa pays and they open restaurants where they hire poor devils like me. My entire life learning how to cook and for what? For nothing. To make shitty plates in a shitty joint where people go to masticate and not to eat. Where do you want to go? So, it didn't occur to you to call. You were busy. Calliope... I don't know where I am lately. You could have texted me though. I had so many things in my mind. What thing can leave you with so little time? It's not a matter of time. It's a matter of concentration. What were you doing then? Meditating? Or were you getting in character? If you 're going to be ironic. We'd better drop it. What were you doing, tell me. We see things completely different. Yes, I can see that. Why do you put such pressure on this? I'm putting pressure... I'm putting pressure on you when I ask for little of your precious time. While you don't have time even for a single message. I get it. Don't go! Why? I don't know. I don't want us to be like this. That's what I'm saying. You don't want to. You are only talking about yourself. I can't continue in this "poetic mood". Admit one thing. You don't want me. Sometimes you... cut! Dimitris... where is Dimitris? "Bricks" is his cue. "Bricks" I action I I can't continue in this poetic mood. Admit one thing. You don't want me. Sometimes you do want me but as soon as we get out of bed there starts the drama. You don't want me. And let me hear it, so maybe then I'll understand what the fuck I'm doing here with you. You don't have to take it like this. Do you want us to be together? Are we together? What will you say now? That all break ups are for the best? I've broken up many times in my life. I don't want to anymore. It all depends on how you look at it. Brick by brick. That's how your personality is being built. And every little brick has its own name. Athena, myrto, Calliope. What are the people? Your little bricks? Answer me this. Is there one person in your life, that once lost, could never be replaced? Every person is irreplaceable. - Every person is irreplaceable. - Cut the crap and answer the question. You know what I'm talking about! I don't know cut! Excellent. That's it. You don't know! Don't you know? Let me see. And this? One facial massage... Do you recall? Yes look at your memories. What do you recall? We celebrate one year together she asks me for a massage i don't do it i don't why? What do you feel? I don't know answer me what do you feel? Answer me can you feel? I don't know you do know what do you feel? I don't know go on you will realise you do know i tell her I took the part i tell her that next year we'll watch the movie together did I tell you about the film? Wait, I'm coming. They called and said, we start shooting in six months time it will be ready next year to premiere at the festival. Are we going to be in a premiere next year? Were you sincere? You won't get away without the massage don't be afraid, tell me what you feel you won't get away without the massage don't be afraid, tell me what you feel i don't know say it happy anniversary my love. What do you feel? Happy anniversary my love. What do you feel? What do you feel? Happy anniversary my love. I don't know happy anniversary my love. Say it i miss her I'm lea ving don't let me do it where are you? Hold me 'will you smoke it? When is the premiere of the film? On the 25th. It's the closing film. And on the 26th the closing ceremony and the awards. I'm thinking of leaving. Where to? I don't know. Far away. If I wasn't afraid of airplanes. Far far away. Won't you be at the premiere? Right now this is the last thing on my mind. Where are you thinking of going? Do you care? Yes. You're not doing it well. - You're not doing it well. - Excuse me? Stop acting as if you care. You're not doing it well outside the set. Can we smoke one cigarette without the drama melpo? I don't need any more drama in my life. And don't call me melpo again. Melpomene is my name. Can you hear me? - What's bothering you? - Things. You have something to tell me. Say it. I told you before. I can't. I knew it. Don'! Leave me I knew it. Don't leave me where are you? I don't know - we can't be together anymore. - We can't be together anymore. - We 7 say the things as they really are. It's you who can't be with me. I miss you i miss you you live with your ghosts... You live with your ghosts... - What is that supposed to mean now? - I have to go. Four years... I picked you up from ariadna's place... We went to eat... Then we got into that small joint where you danced salsa all night long. And here's where we kissed. Listen... There is too much tension and I don't know why. We need to relax. We need to let this chill out a bit. And how do we do that? I don't know... We could sleep separately for a while... I could go to my old roommates every now and then. And what do you think will happen then? It will be better this way. Just for a while. To let us breathe... To let us miss each other. I don't like what you're saying. Fine, forget it. It wasn't such a good idea. I don't know... We should... Hello. Yes, I'm out. Now? What for? I have to go. There's been a problem at the restaurant with Andreas and they don't have a cook for today. What the fuck's the matter with those idiots! I'm off... Do you want me to take you home? You just got here? I went out for a walk. Do you think of me? Still like this? Still like what? - Still like what? - You're not dressed yet. What's up with melpomene? What's llp'7 that's what I'm asking. Ls something going on? I kept seeing you together lately. Little laughs, little jokes... Nothing is going on. She won't be at the premiere tonight. She's off. Venezuela has she mentioned something to you? No. Did you fuck her? Ok, I know, a gentleman never tells. Why did you let me leave? But I want to know. If you did love me, why? But I want to know. If you did love me, why? If you did love me, why? Did you fuck her? Quit it! What's wrong? - What's wrong? - I'm sore. Right... The stress of the premiere. Or is it something else? I know you can you hear me? Where is the King? And Edmund responds... Where are you? ... And Edmund responds... Contending with the fretful element i miss you contending with the fretful element {Miss you bids the winds blow the earth into the sea bids the winds blow the earth into the sea or swell the curled water 'bove the main i miss you or swell the curled water 'bove the main that things might change... Or c8358.. We broke up. Who broke up? We did. We broke up. How did we manage already? You didn't know, right? And that she didn't go on board planes, did you know that? It seems like she's over it. I'm hurting it seems like she's over it. I'm hurting or at least she is trying to. Or at least she is trying to. I am hurting what's the matter? You were into her the other day. - Now is not the other day. - And what day is it today? Blow, wind and crack your cheeks rage! Why did you let me leave? Rage! Why did you let me leave? Blow! Unleash your fury why did you jet' me? Unleash your fury why did you let me? You cataracts and hurricanoes spout you cataracts and hurricanoes spout till you have drench'd our steeples drown'd the cocks! Why? Drown'd the cocks! You sulphurous and thought-executing fires vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts i am hurting i am hurting singe my white head! Singe my white head! Crack nature's moulds all germens spill at once that make ingrateful man! I miss you that make ingrateful man! I miss you do you see? Why did you let me leave? I would be here now i would be here what's wrong? I'm thinking. What? Tomorrow is our anniversary. Two years. It would have been, anyway. Still think about her? I do. I don't remember a thing about her. But I think about her. I miss her presence. And I live with her absence. When the film started we were still together. In fact, because the premiere was arranged. We knew when we would see it. One day before our anniversary. But I saw it alone. Your names are wrong. You know that right? They are correct alright. Something hasn't happened yet. Something hasn't happened. Stop here something hasn't happened. Stop here can you see me? Yes listen carefully i brought her i took her away now tell me why listen to me i don't know where I am going i don't forgive me did you love me? I did too much look I want to hear you I'm leaving you want to leave a four year relationship for someone you met for one night? There is no other. There's no-one. And this has been over for quite some time now. What are you talking about? Nothing is over. What am Italking about... I'm talking about us. About our relationship that no longer exists. That's what I am talking about. And now tell me. What are you talking about? That we can fix everything even though it seems so difficult. If we haven't done this for so long, you think now all of a sudden we'll fix it all? I now know what I want. And what I want is to be with you. You don't convince me. Hector... It's been a very long time since I saw myself in your life... I love you hi h; what is your name? Aphrodite i am listening I was afraid of what? To forgive I was hurting and what has changed now? I did I wondered like being hypnotised, going towards somewhere but I wasn't letting myself go I never let myself go entirely it wasn't her fault it was no one's fault it was me all along did you tell her? How could I, when she doesn't exist anymore? Tell her hi hi Hector this is... Yes, this is the second-third. Or second-three. I'm still not really sure how they call it here in Barcelona. I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake. It must be elsewhere. Don't worry, if only all mistakes were like this. Right... You just got here? Yes, I came to visit a friend we are only men here I mean, there is no girl atmate what a welcome has Barcelona given you! The truth is I left with sun, I didn't expect it to be raining here. Where are you coming from? From Madrid. Malasafia a neighbourhood what is it that smells so nice? I'm cooking. You're cooking? Yes, why? Because men don't cook. Especially at night... And to smell so nice... I am a chef. I like to cook. A chef... how interesting! I've never met a chef before... Well, we are celebrating something you see and I'm preparing something special. And what would that be? I'm preparing a bolovan with COD and boletus, that you'll love. A what? A bolovan with COD and boletus, that you'll love. It's like a pastry filled with codfish... The codfish is car-am elised with boletus do you know what caramelised means? So, you cook it in low fire with oil... Then you add milk cream and eggs... Where have you been? I was worried. What was taking you so long? I got mixed up and I knocked on the wrong door. Where are you going without an umbrella in this weather? Hi. Hi... Nice meeting you! Likewise! It has caught my attention. You are invited. Fine... I'll be waiting inside. When? Now. No! Now no... tomorrow! Oh no, tomorrow I can't. I am leaving on a trip. When you come back then. In one year. What? Yes, you see, I got this international culinary scholarship. And what's that? It's a huge deal! I will go through the best restaurants of Europe during the next year. Today I finished my practice at the "sergi", you know it? That's why with the fiesta... Tomorrow Paris, then Italy, Belgium. Anyway, it's crazy. Congratulations mr chef! Just a humble scholar eh! Cutting onions... I love onions, even though... I wish you the best thank you. And good bye... Two years' old images came to my mind maybe because it was a day like today when I invaded your photograph. It was around this time when I met you... And you told me something, unintentionally "come in" "I will sting you" "I ought to" debia for me to realise what I failed to say... What I failed to do... What I failed to do... ...What I failed to give... To you my love, thank you I lost this chance and I hurt so I will not loose another one facial massage... As many as you want... Just one more.
