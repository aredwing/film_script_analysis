YES, I'M HUNG OVER. YES, LAST NIGHT WAS MY BIRTHDAY. AND YES, I WOKE UP ALONE AGAIN. WELL, NOT TOTALLY ALONE. COME SAY HI, NEWT. - UH, HI. - AND RIGHT NOW, I SHOULD BE GOING ON MY NEXT AUDITION. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO. GO AHEAD, NEWT. ASK ME WHY. - WHY? - BECAUSE I WON'T GET THE PART. I NEVER GET THE PART. AND HONESTLY, I REALLY DON'T WANT THE PAR IN THIS SHITTY, LOW-BUDGE INDEPENDENT MOVIE WITH A BUNCH OF SHITTY FUCKING WANNABE ACTORS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY WANT? GO AHEAD, NEWT. ASK ME. - WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT, JUSTIN? - TO GET LAID BY A RIDICULOUSLY HOT CHICK. - I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. HE WANTS TO SHOO SOME KIND OF DOCUMENTARY. BUT HE OFFERED ME TEN BUCKS AND A CHIPOTLE BURRITO FOR EVERY DAY I FOLLOW HIM AROUND WITH MY CAMERA. - WHAT, DON'T AC LIKE YOU'RE ALL COOL. YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED. - THIS IS TRUE. [dubious guitar chords] - PROBLEM IS, TYPE OF GIRLS THAT I WANT TO BANG DON'T WANT TO BANG ME. THESE HOLLYWOOD HOTTIES WANT A GUY WITH POWER. THEY WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN CHANGE THEIR LIFE. AND BY LIFE, I MEAN CAREER. THE PERFECT HANGOVER CURE. [angelic choral singing] THIS DOCUMENTARY IS ABOUT A GROUP OF DUDES WHO HOLD A FAKE CASTING SESSION FOR A FAKE MOVIE SO THAT WE CAN GET LAID FOR REAL. COME ON, NEWT. LET'S GO GET CHASE. [music playing] HEY, ROOMIE. - GET OUT. - HE'S LIKE A KITTEN IN THE MORNING. I NEED YOU GET OVER JORDAN, MAN. - I'M OVER HER. - WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT. - IT'S REALLY OVER THIS TIME. - MY ROOMMATE? MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM. CHASE LOCKWOOD? HE'S A MAJOR STAR IN CHINA AND INDIA FOR SOME "B" HORROR ALIEN FILM HE DID. HE MIGHT EVEN BE A BIGGER STAR IN WEST HOLLYWOOD FOR STARRING IN WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THE BISEXUAL PARODY OF TWILIGHT. HE WAS THE "EDWARD." THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY, BRO. PEOPLE THAT BREAK UP 17 TIMES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE TOGETHER. - YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. - UNDERSTAND WHAT? - SHE WAS THE BEST SEX EVER. - YOU KNOW, IT DID SOUND PRETTY GOOD. [knocks lightly] PAPER-THIN. NOW, CHASE'S EX-GIRLFRIEND, JORDAN HOLLIDAY, SHE'S A SMOKING-HOT CHICK. BUT I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT, SEEING AS SHE IS A HUGE MOVIE STAR. - SHE'S SO HOT  SO I'MA TAKE HER HOME TO MAKE  - BUT SHE'S THE BIGGEST BITCH WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. THINK HER EXACT WORDS WERE... - "I NEED A MAN, NOT A BOY." - LOVE MY ROOMMATE. LOVE LIVING IN HIS CONDO. BUT HE'S TOTALLY ONE OF THOSE ACTORS. AND WE'RE STATING HE'S A MODEL TOO-- NOT FOR ANYTHING GOOD. [chuckles] IN FACT, HE MAY BE THE VAINES PERSON IN LOS ANGELES, COMPLETE WITH A ZOOLANDER COMPLEX. - SHE'S SO HOT  SO I'MA TAKE HER HOME TO MAKE  - IN FACT, IF YOU ASK HIM, HE'LL TELL YOU HE INVENTED ZOOLANDER. - DO I HAVE A ZOOLANDER COMPLEX? [scoffs] NO. BUT I DID COME UP WITH THE IDEA. - [chuckling] - SO I WAS SITTING IN A STARBUCKS, AND I WAS TELLING THIS CHICK THE IDEA, AND I WAS PROBABLY TALKING REALLY LOUD, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I WAS EXCITED. AND I LOOKED OVER, AND THERE'S FUCKING BEN STILLER STANDING THERE, LISTENING TO ME WHILE HE WAITED FOR HIS COFFEE. - AND WHAT WAS BEN STILLER DRINKING? - AND THEN HE WALKED OU WITH HIS FRAPPUCCINO. - BUT MY ROOMMATE'S GONNA BE A VERY VALUABLE ASSET TO THE PLAN. IF I'M GONNA CAS A FAKE MOVIE, I'M GONNA NEED A SOMEWHA RECOGNIZABLE ACTOR ATTACHED. AT LEAST HE HAS CREDITS. [drum cadence] I NEED YOU, MAN. - I NEED GOOD SEX. - EXACTLY. I'LL HELP YOU. NOT BY PLAYING WITH YOUR PECKER. - [sighs] YOU'RE GONNA GET ME JORDAN BACK. - NO. I'LL GET YOU SOMEONE HOTTER. - [scoffs] NOT POSSIBLE. - OKAY, SOMEONE EQUALLY AS HOT. ANOTHER ACTRESS. YOU COULD MAKE HER JEALOUS. - I'M LISTENING. - EVERY AUDITION I GO TO, THERE'S A LINE OF GIRLS OUT THE DOOR. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET INSIDE, IT'S A BUNCH OF DOUCHE BAGS HOLDING THE AUDITIONS. - SO JUSTIN TELLS ME HE HAS A PLAN. - THESE GUYS AREN'T EVEN COOL. THEY DO HAVE THE ATTENTION OF OVER 100 SMOKING-HOT CHICKS. - JUSTIN'S A NICE GUY. HE'S GOT A KIND FACE. HE'S INSTANTLY LIKEABLE. BUT IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE HIM IN A PHRASE, HE'S ULTRA MEDIUM. - I MEAN, I'M A GOOD-LOOKING GUY. - HE'S NOT GOOD-LOOKING, BUT HE'S NOT BAD, I GUESS. - I'M HILARIOUS. - HE'S NOT FUNNY, BUT HE'S NOT NOT FUNNY. - I'VE GOT A JOB. - HIS JOB SUCKS ASS. [chuckles] BUT AT LEAST HE'S GOT ONE. - SO WHY CAN'T I HAVE ONE OF THESE GIRLS? - OH, JUSTIN, OKAY. I'LL PLAY ALONG WITH YOUR LITTLE GAME. - SO CHASE IS IN. HIM AND I ARE GONNA BE THE LEADS IN THIS FAKE MOVIE. BUT NOW WE NEED A CREW. TIME TO ASSEMBLE THE TEAM OCEAN'S ELEVEN STYLE. - I LOVE HOW JUSTIN MAKES AN OCEAN'S ELEVEN REFERENCE. HE TOTALLY VIEWS HIMSELF LIKE GEORGE CLOONEY. WELL, NEWS FLASH, J BONE. YOU'RE NO CLOONEY. [chuckles] BUT I COULD SEE HOW HE'D THINK I'D BE THE BRAD PITT. [camera shutter clicks] [upbeat pop punk music] - WE'RE LIVING HERE IN HOLLYWOOD  UNDER THE SKIES OF BLUE - THESE GUYS: ALSO BRILLIANT. - WHAT'S UP, BIOTCHES? WHAT'S UP WITH THE CAMERA? - TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF OUR LIVES. - HELL YEAH, IT IS! ROSS, WE GOT COMPANY. - AND A CAMERA? - AND A CAMERA. - WHAT'S UP, FELLAS? - YO. - HEY, BUDDY. - SO APPARENTLY, OUR LIVES ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE. - OKAY. - GET THIS. I WANT TO HOLD A FAKE AUDITION FOR A FAKE MOVIE SO THAT WE CAN MEET AND CAS A LOT OF HOT BITCHES. - I FUCKING LOVE IT. - I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. - THAT'S BECAUSE YOU THINK WITH YOUR HEAD TOO MUCH, MAN. USE YOUR COCK AND BALLS LIKE THE REST OF US. - THAT'S WHERE YOU GUYS WOULD COME IN. YOU'D BE THE WRITERS. - OF THE FAKE MOVIE? - EXACTLY. - GENIUS! - I KNOW, RIGHT? - SO YOU WANT US TO WRITE A FAKE SCRIPT? - WELL, NOT AN ENTIRE SCRIPT. I DON'T NEED A WHOLE SCREENPLAY, JUST AN IDEA AND THEN A FEW SCENES WE CAN USE DURING A CASTING SESSION. ROSS AND AUSTIN, ALSO KNOWN AS ROSTIN, JUST GOT DONE WRITING A BOMB-ASS VAMPIRE WEB SERIES. THESE GUYS WRITE HOT GIRL PARTS BETTER THAN ANYONE I'VE EVER KNOWN. - YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WRITERS, DO YOU? - NOT AS GOOD AS ROSTIN. - AW, THANKS, BROSKI. - ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S I SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT? - IT'S UP TO YOU. WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY THE BRAINS BEHIND THIS FAKE PROJECT. IT JUST NEEDS TO STAR A BUNCH OF HOT GIRLS, LIKE, FOUR OR FIVE, BASICALLY ONE FOR EACH OF US. AND THEY SHOULD BE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL TO LOOK LIKE THE GIRLS OF OUR DREAMS. - DO WE GET AN IMDB CREDI FOR WRITING A FAKE MOVIE? - THIS IS FUCKING PHENOMENAL. EACH ONE OF US WILL, IN GREAT DETAIL, WRITE OUT AN AUDITION NOTICE FOR OUR "PERFECT GIRL." - IT'S GOT TO BE A HORROR FILM. - YES, HORROR FILMS LOVE SLUTS. - AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A BIG GROUP OF GIRLS. - OOH, AND THEY GET LOS WHILE THEY'RE CAMPING IN THE WOODS. - NO, NOT OUT IN THE WOODS. - MUD WRESTLING TOURNAMENT. - BE REALISTIC. - WHAT? THIS ISN'T A REAL MOVIE. SLUMBER PARTY. - JACKPOT. - BAM. - THE BLOODY SLUMBER PARTY. - YEAH, I COULD STAR IN THAT. - FIVE GIRLS HAVING A SLUMBER PARTY ALL GET BRUTALLY MURDERED IN A HOUSE OVERNIGHT. - NOT BAD. - CHASE AND I PLAY TWO OF THEIR BOYFRIENDS. WE SHOW UP AND SAVE THE DAY. - I'M GONNA WRITE IN MY PERFECT GIRL. - AND I'LL FINALLY WRITE MINE. - AND WE'RE GONNA WRITE IN ONE MORE GIRL, BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA NEED A HAPPY PRODUCER. - I'VE NEVER PRODUCED ANYTHING. - BUT YOU'RE GOOD WITH MONEY. - BUT THIS ISN'T A REAL MOVIE. - BUT IT IS A REAL DOCUMENTARY. - YEAH, I NOTICED THE CAMERA. WHAT'S UP, NEWT? - HEY, BEN. - FOCUS. - I'M LISTENING. - ROSS AND AUSTIN ARE WRITING SCENES FOR THE FAKE MOVIE. IT'S CALLED THE BLOODY SLUMBER PARTY. - YEAH, I GET IT. - SO YOU'RE IN? - NO. AND I DON'T THINK GIRLS WILL BE, EITHER. - OF COURSE THERE WILL BE. THIS IS L.A. THERE'S TONS OF SEXY HOPEFULS OUT THERE. - CREATING A FAKE MOVIE IS NOT GONNA MAKE GIRLS WANT TO DATE YOU. - HAVE YOU EVER TRIED? - HE HAD A POINT. YOU HAVE A POINT. - YOU SEE? - BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WHEN THEY FIND OU THAT THERE'S NO REAL MOVIE? - I DON'T KNOW. STRETCH IT OU AS LONG AS WE CAN. - HOW LONG IS THAT? - LONG ENOUGH FOR A KICKOFF PARTY AND A TABLE READ. - HOW DO YOU HAVE A TABLE READ WITHOUT A SCRIPT? - MAYBE THAT'S WHERE IT'LL ALL END, THEN, AT THE TABLE READ. WE'LL TELL THEM THE TRUTH. - IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. - BUT THE GIRLS WILL STILL BE HAPPY. - WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY STILL BE HAPPY? - BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, THEY WERE ALL ACTRESSES IN THIS DOCUMENTARY. - GIRLS AREN'T GONNA GO FOR THIS. HE'LL PROBABLY GET SUED. I'M IN. - PRAISE JESUS. I'VE KNOWN BEN SINCE KINDERGARTEN. THE FIRST TIME I FINGERED A GIRL WAS AT HIS EIGHTH GRADE BIRTHDAY PARTY. HE'S A COOL GUY, BUT HE'S NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK WITH THE LADIES. IT'S BECAUSE HE'S ANAL, AND HE USED TO BE AN ADVERTISING DORK. BUT NOW THAT HE'S LAID OFF, HE SHOULD BE A MOVIE PRODUCER. I BET HIS RATIO OF PUSSY TO PUSSYLESS NIGHTS WOULD CHANGE DRASTICALLY. - BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE ALL THE GIRLS SIGN SOMETHING. - HE'S A SMART GUY. I KNEW HE WAS A NO-BRAINER. LIKE WHAT? - I DON'T KNOW. SOME KIND OF RELEASE FORM. YOU CAN'T PUT GIRLS IN A DOCUMENTARY WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. AND YOU CAN'T PUT ME IN IT, EITHER. clang! [funky rock music] - HE'S SUPER SUCCESSFUL. HE OWNS A COMPANY. - WHAT KIND OF COMPANY? - I DON'T KNOW. WHAT KIND OF COMPANY? - I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE'S GOT THE BEST POT. - FANTASTIC. - BUT HE HAS PRODUCED A MOVIE BEFORE, RIGHT? - YEAH, AND THE LADIES LOVE HIM. - FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE - OH, WHY, THANK YOU, BAMBI. - SURE THING, BIG J. [smooches] - AIN'T SHE A PEACH? - SHE'S NOT UGLY. - AND IF YOU LIKE BRUNETTES... HEY, ARIEL! SAY HI TO THE BOYS. - HI, BOYS. boing! - I WONDER IF JOHNSON NEEDS A POOL BOY. - A FAKE CASTING SESSION, HUH? YEAH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A FUN IDEA. - SO YOU'RE IN? - [laughing] WHOA. I DON'T NEED ANY MORE HOT CHICKS. - HE DOESN'T. EVERYONE THAT KNOWS JOHNSON LOVES JOHNSON, AND JOHNSON KNOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE'S KIND OF LIKE THE HUGH HEFNER OF THE 818. - SO WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME AS THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER? - JUST YOUR NAME. - AND MAYBE YOUR PLACE FOR A KILLER KICKOFF PARTY. - THAT KID WAS SO PATHETIC. I JUST COULDN'T TELL HIM NO. PLUS I LIKE CHASE. HE'S MY BOY. AND HE HELPED ME MAKE A LOT OF MONEY TOO. - YOU ROCK, DUDE. - I KNOW. I'M BEST AT PRODUCING SMILES. [hip-hop music] - WE'VE GOT ALMOST EVERYONE WE NEED. - BUT WE STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT SOME LOGISTICS. - LIKE WHAT? - LIKE WHERE ARE WE GONNA SHOO MOST OF THIS, WHERE ARE WE GONNA HOLD AUDITIONS, WHO'S GONNA DIRECT IT? - OH, YEAH. WE TOTALLY NEED A DIRECTOR. - CAN NEWT JUST DIRECT IT? - I DON'T KNOW. CAN YOU, NEWT? - I'D RATHER NOT. - YOU KNOW ANY GOOD DIRECTORS? - [chuckles] NOT GOOD DIRECTORS. - YEAH, YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF HIS MOVIES. - WHAT? I GOT SOME AWESOME FANS. - FOR SOME REASON, CHASE FORWARDS ME HIS FAN E-MAILS. THEY'RE USUALLY FROM DUDES OR INDIANS, NOT THE FEATHER KIND, THE ONES WITH DOTS. - AND YOU'VE NEVER WORKED AS AN ACTOR IN THIS TOWN, SO YOU DON'T KNOW ANY DIRECTORS. - ACTUALLY, I DID THIS ONE PLAY. - OH, YEAH. THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY. - THE DIRECTOR, PARKER, HE'S KIND OF CRAZY. - CRAZY GOOD LIKE AN ARTIS OR CRAZY BAD? - CRAZY LIKE HE YELLED IN MY FACE. - WHAT'D HE SAY? - "YOU'RE FIRED." - YEAH, HE FIRED ME. - OH, SO THIS GUY MIGHT ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. - EVERY NOW AND THEN, BEN'S A REAL DICK. I MEAN, I GUESS WE COULD ASK HIM. HE IS SCARY AND MOODY, THOUGH, BUT HE DOES HAVE A NICE THEATER. I THINK HE LIVES THERE. - PERFECT. - ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WELL, I GOT TO BOUNCE. I GOT LUNCH WITH RIHANNA, SO PEACE. - IS THAT TRUE? - WHO KNOWS? WELL, LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE THEATER AND ASK HIM. - WHEN HE SEES THE SWARM OF ATTRACTIVE WOMEN HE'LL GET TO DIRECT, I'M SURE HE'LL DO IT. - NO FUCKING WAY. - WHY NOT? - BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T EVEN LIKE YOU. - ALL I DID WAS IMPROV ONE EXTRA LINE. - AND IT RUINED THE PERFEC COMEDIC TIMING THAT I HAD MASTERMINDED. - I'M SORRY. - THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY. AND SECONDLY, I DON'T EVEN LIKE WOMEN. - YOU DON'T? - YOU DON'T? - NO, THEY'RE ANNOYING, AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PENIS. - WOW. I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE GAY. - NO ONE KNOWS. I'M COOL LIKE THAT. - WHAT IF WE ADDED A GAY CHARACTER? - WE CAN'T DO THAT. - WHY NOT? - YEAH, WHY NOT? - I MEAN, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT A BUNCH OF HOT GIRLS GETTING SLAUGHTERED AT A SLUMBER PARTY. - WELL, WHY DON'T YOU MAKE THE KILLER A GAY GUY? - I GUESS WE COULD TALK TO ROSTIN ABOUT IT. - AND I WANT TO KISS A BUNCH OF STRAIGHT GUYS AT THESE FAKE AUDITIONS. - WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY IRONED OU ALL THE DETAILS YET. - AND I WANT AN ASSISTANT. I REMEMBER JUSTIN HAD A REALLY CUTE FRIEND THAT CAME TO SEE HIS PLAY LAST YEAR, GOT WASTED WITH US AFTER. - ASSISTANT? - YES. I WANT A PERSONAL ASSISTANT. - YOU KNOW THIS ISN' A REAL MOVIE YOU'RE DIRECTING, RIGHT? - DO YOU WANT TO USE MY NAME, MY CREDITS, MY THEATER? - YEAH. - THEN OBEY MY COMMANDS. THAT'S HOW I DO IT. WHO WAS YOUR FRIEND THAT CAME OUT WITH US AFTER OPENING NIGHT? HE WAS AN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. WHAT WAS HIS NAME? - RYAN? - RYAN. THAT'S IT. BINGO. - SO IF WE GET YOU A MALE CHARACTER AND RYAN COMES ON BOARD AS YOUR ASSISTANT DIRECTOR-- - PERSONAL ASSISTANT. - WHATEVER. YOU'LL COME ON BOARD? - I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. - SO YOU WANT ME TO BE THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF A FILM THAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY MAKING. - PRECISELY. - COOL. I'M DOWN. - HEY, BOYS. I DON'T THINK WE'VE MET. - HEY, I'M BEN. - COOL. I'M KATIE. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - SO WHAT YOU GUYS DOING? - WE'RE MAKING A MOVIE. - YAY! CAN I BE IN IT? - OH, IT'S NOT A REAL MOVIE. - WELL, NOT EXACTLY. - THEN I HAD THIS BRILLIANT THOUGHT. - BEN ALWAYS THINKS HIS THOUGHTS ARE BRILLIANT. - WHAT IF WE BROUGHT KATIE ON BOARD TOO, YOU KNOW, FOR SAFEKEEPING? - SAFEKEEPING? - AS PRODUCER, I'M ALWAYS LOOKING OU FOR OUR BEST INTERESTS, AND WE DO RUN THE RISK OF INSULTING THE FEMININE RACE, SO HAVING A FEMALE ON BOARD WOULD CERTAINLY LESSEN THE BLOW. - SOMETIMES HE IS ACTUALLY KIND OF SMART. - SHE COULD BE OUR BRIDGE KEEPER, A GATEWAY, IF YOU WILL, TO THE OTHER WORLD WE KNOW AS WOMEN. - I LIKE IT. - I LOVE IT. DO YOU GUYS HAVE A CASTING DIRECTOR YET? both: WE DO NOW! [upbeat rock music] - WE'RE A FEW SHORT OF 11, BUT PRETTY SOLID CREW, IF I DON'T SAY SO MYSELF. - I SHOULD PROBABLY GO TANNING. - AND THE FAKE LITTLE MOVIE SPROUTED LEGS. - FUCK YEAH, IT HAS! - IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD. - WE'RE NOT REALLY CAPABLE OF WRITING UTTER SHIT. - IT ALL CENTERS AROUND FIVE GIRLS... - HOT SLUTS. - WHO ARE ENJOYING A SLUMBER PARTY... - UNTIL A MONSTER COMES ALONG AND RIPS THEIR FUCKING HEADS OFF! - EH, SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. - I THOUGH I WAS PLAYING THE LEAD. - IT'S NOT A REAL MOVIE. HAS ANYONE TOLD CHASE YET? - BUT I'M IN IT, RIGHT? - SO WE ADDED CHASE LOCKWOOD IN AS THE LEAD GIRL'S BOYFRIEND. HE COMES IN AND SAVES THE DAY! - CAN I HAVE BRASS KNUCKLES? - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE FAKE ACTORS IN THE FAKE MOVIE. - AND JUSTIN WAS BEING SUCH A LITTLE BITCH ABOUT EVERYTHING, SO WE TOLD HIM HE COULD PLAY CHASE'S BEST FRIEND. - WE SHOULD BE BROTHERS. - NOPE. - VAMPIRES? - NOPE. - SUPERMODELS? - SHUT THE FUCK UP, JUSTIN. - OKAY. WHAT ABOUT THE GAY CHARACTER? I FORGOT TO TELL THEM WE NEED TO WRITE IN A GAY CHARACTER FOR PARKER. - I DON'T WRITE HOMOS... ANYMORE. - WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE AT THIS POINT. - SO I AGREED. THE FIERCE MONSTER TURNED INTO A FIERCE GAY GUY. - MOTIVE, GUYS? - ONE OF THE GIRLS SAW HER BOYFRIEND KISSING ANOTHER GUY, AND THAT MADE HER REALLY UPSET. - SO UPSET THAT SHE HAD TO HAVE A SLEEPOVER WITH ALL OF HER BEST FRIENDS AND ONLY WEAR LINGERIE. - AND SINCE THE BOYFRIEND WASN'T READY TO COME OUT OF THE CLOSE JUST YET, HE OBVIOUSLY HAD TO KILL ALL OF THE GIRLS BEFORE HIS SECRE SPREAD TOO FAR. - SO MY CHARACTER GETS KILLED BY AN ANGRY GAY GUY? both: YES. - FUCK. - LONG LIVE THE ANGRY GAY GUY! I'M IN. [upbeat rock music] - IT'S TOO LATE  TO TURN BACK NOW SO TURN IT UP, AND MAKE IT LOUD  IT'S THE CROWD  IF YOU LET THEM SEE IT'S NOT FOR YOU OR YOU OR YOU  IT'S FOR ME  IT'S FOR ME  IT'S FOR ME  IT'S FOR ME  IT'S TOO LATE TO TURN BACK NOW  - HERE'S WHERE THE FUN BEGINS. SO THE NAME OF THE MOVIE IS THE BLOODY SLUMBER PARTY. - SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF GIRLS ON THEIR PERIOD. - OKAY. AND I NEED EACH ONE OF YOU GUYS TO SEND ME A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAMS. THAT WAY, WE CAN SEND IT TO KATIE AND GET A LITTLE CASTING NOTICE UP. - BIG TITS. - I SECOND THAT. - [scoffs] GREAT, GUYS. - GROSS. THE ONLY THING TATAS DO FOR ME IS REMIND ME OF WHEN I DRANK MY MOTHER'S MILK. - SERIOUSLY, GUYS. THERE'S FIVE GIRLS BEING CAST, RIGHT? - YES. - RIGHT. - SO THAT'S ONE FOR EACH OF US, AND THEY CAN LOOK LIKE AND BE LIKE WHATEVER WE WANT. - YES, PARKER? - AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THERE'S TO BE ONE BOY? - TWO, ACTUALLY. - WHY TWO? - WELL, IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TWO DUDES KISS, WE'VE GOT TO CAST THEM BOTH. - NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY. WE CAN JUST CAST THE ONE. I'LL MAKE A CAMEO APPEARANCE. - WHY IS THAT PARKER GUY ALWAYS STARING AT ME? - GUYS, FOCUS. I KNOW THIS PLAN WILL WORK, BUT IF WE'RE GONNA GET LAID, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THIS CASTING NOTICE SERIOUSLY. - SO ONE BY ONE, THE BOYS DESCRIBED TO ME THEIR PERFECT GIRL. - AHEM. - AND BOY. - A GOOD GIRL-NEXT-DOOR TYPE, PREFERABLY BRUNETTE, GOOD SMILE, GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, AND A LITTLE QUIRKY, HAS BOOBS, AND ISN'T CRAZY. - YOU KNOW, BLONDE OR BRUNETTE, DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. SHE HAS TO BE A BOMBSHELL, THOUGH, OBVIOUSLY, AND SHE HAS TO TOLERATE THIS KID THAT'S IN A MAN'S BODY. OH, AND SHE HAS TO LIKE ANAL PLAY. - BRUNETTE. PETITE. SLENDER TO MILDLY ATHLETIC. GORGEOUS FACE. GREAT SMILE. SWEET ASS. SMALL BUT WITH SOME POP. IT JUST SHOULD FIT PERFECTLY IN MY HAND. I'M AN ASS GUY. LOVE ASS. NOT SO MUCH FOR TITS, BUT ASS. - I WANT TO DATE THE PERFECT BLONDE, THE KIND WHOSE LOOKS AND SMILES LIGHTS UP A ROOM, ABOUT 5'2" TO 5'7" WITH LOTS OF POSITIVE ENERGY. TOTALLY COOL, THOUGH, IF SHE HAS DADDY ISSUES OR IS A LITTLE UNSTABLE. MAKES HER EASIER TO MANIPULATE. - [sighs] THE PERFECT GUY. SO TOUGH TO DESCRIBE. PREPPY TO JOCKISH. AROUND 25. MUSCULAR. NO, NO, NOT MUSCULAR. WELL-TONED. JUST NOT CHUNKY. FUCK CHUNKY. - I BET I ALREADY KNOW WHAT CHASE WILL SAY. IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME. - I LIKE A CHICK WHO'S... - BLOND... - BLOND... - NICE LIPS... - SEXY LIPS... - TAN... - FAKE TAN. WELL, IT DOESN' HAVE TO BE FAKE. JUST TAN, I GUESS. - AND BIG BOOBS. - AND BIG, BEAUTIFUL FUCKING TITTIES. - WELL, THAT WAS AN EXPERIENCE. - OKAY, MAYBE THIS IS AN OUTSIDE OPINION, BUT DID YOU GUYS EVER THINK THAT DOING ALL THIS COULD BE, UM, WRONG? OKAY, THEN. - WELL, I'D BE FLATTERED IF I WERE CHOSEN. - THANK YOU, KATIE. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. - UH, I DID NOTICE ONE POSSIBLE LITTLE PROBLEM THAT WE MIGHT BE FACING, THOUGH. - WHAT? - WELL, NOBODY DESCRIBED A, UM--UM-- - A WHAT? - AN ETHNIC GIRL. - YOU'VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME. - HE'S GOT A GOOD ARGUMENT. - BUT WHY DOES IT EVEN MATTER? - WELL, WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK WE'RE RACIST. - WHO'S GONNA THINK THAT? - I DON'T KNOW. ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT THE CASTING NOTICE OR DISTRIBUTORS ONE DAY. I MEAN, WE ARE PLANNING TO MARKET AND SELL THIS AS A DOCUMENTARY EVENTUALLY, RIGHT? - HE HAS A POINT. - THANK YOU, NEWT. - NO, SHUT UP, NEWT! JUST HOLD THE CAMERA, AND HOLD THE RED BUTTON WHEN I TELL YOU TO! - SOMETIMES I THINK JUSTIN FORGETS WHO'S HOLDING THE CAMERA. - I SEE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM, BUT THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT US GETTING EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT CATERING TO ALL DIFFERENT COLORS AND KINDS OF PEOPLE. I MEAN, UNLESS ONE OF YOU GUYS WANTS TO PICK SOMEONE WHO ISN'T WHITE. - YEAH. SURE, WHY NOT? I'LL BITE THE BULLET. - WELL, THAT'S CERTAINLY KIND OF YOU. BITE THE BULLET? WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS POLITICALLY CORREC AND CONSIDERATE AS POSSIBLE IN THIS PROJECT. - I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BANG AN ASIAN CHICK. - AND MARK ME DOWN FOR OPEN ETHNICITY. - OKAY, SO IT'S SETTLED. KATIE, YOU HAVE ALL THE NOTES? - RIGHT HERE. - PERFECT. TONIGHT YOU, ME, AND BEN WILL POST THE CASTING NOTICE ON THE BREAKDOWN SITE. PROBABLY CAN GE OVER 1,000 SUBMISSIONS. - MAYBE 1 MILLION. - DOUBTFUL. - YOU GONNA SAY I'M STARRING IN THIS THING, RIGHT? - YES, SIR. - MILLI. - WE'LL CALL IN ALL THE GIRLS THAT ARE SEVEN AND ABOVE. AUDITIONS WILL BE NEXT WEEK. ANY FINAL QUESTIONS? - BUT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY GONNA MAKE THE MOVIE, RIGHT? - LET'S MEET TONIGH IF YOU WANT TO  YOU BRING THE GIRLS I'LL BRING MY CREW  YEAH, YEAH WE'LL GET IT FEELING RIGHT  [upbeat pop punk music] ROCK ME TONIGH IF YOU FEEL SO  NO INHIBITIONS, JUST LET GO  YEAH - YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD PUT ME AS A PRODUCER AS WELL. - WHY? - BECAUSE IT'S POWER. BE A LOT EASIER FOR ME TO GET LAID IF I'M A PRODUCER AND NOT JUS AN ACTOR WITH A SAY IN CASTING. - BUT I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PRODUCER. - WE COULD BOTH BE PRODUCERS. - OKAY, WHICH ONE IS IT, ONE OR TWO? - TWO. - WAIT. - WHAT? - HOW ABOUT IF I'M THE PRODUCER AND YOU'RE, LIKE, A COPRODUCER? - WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? - I'VE BEEN DOING MY HOMEWORK AND RESEARCHING A VARIETY OF JOB TITLES IN THIS INDUSTRY, AND I FOUND THAT PRODUCER IS SORT OF LIKE A HEAD HONCHO. I USED TO THINK IT WAS THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, BUT THAT'S MORE OF A MONEY GUY, AND COPRODUCER IS CERTAINLY A STEP BELOW. I WANT TO BE THE ONLY PRODUCER ON THIS THING IF I'M ACTUALLY GONNA PRODUCE IT. IT'S A POWER AND CONTROL KIND OF THING. I'M GOOD AT HAVING BOTH. - FINE. MAKE ME COPRODUCER. - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE SUCH A RETARD SOMETIMES. - OKAY, AND JOHNSON IS EXEC, RIGHT? - YES. - OKAY. NOW WE'RE INTO THE STORY AND THE CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS. - HEY, HEY BABY, I KNOW YOU WANT TO PARTY NOW  WE GOT IT GOING, CAN'T SHUT US DOWN  I'M GONNA MAKE YOU SAY, "OOH, BABY, I LIKE IT," YEAH  BABY, I KNOW YOU WAN TO PARTY NOW  - OKAY, GUYS. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M A LITTLE OFFENDED. I MEAN, YOU HAVE TWO BLONDES AND TWO BRUNETTES, NO REDHEADS. - OH, NO. NOT THE ETHNIC CARD AGAIN. - OH, I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU. BUT YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE GOOD NOT TO HAVE, LIKE, TWO BLONDES. I MEAN, A LITTLE DIVERSITY IS ALWAYS NICE. - YOU WANT TO GIVE UP YOUR BLONDE? - FUCK NO. - MAYBE CHASE WILL. - HEY, CHASE, YOU WANT TO DATE A REDHEAD INSTEAD? - UH, YEAH, SURE. WHATEVER. - I FIGURE WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, HE DOESN'T REALLY CARE. - REDHEAD, BLONDE, I DON'T REALLY CARE. BESIDES, IF I LIKE JUSTIN'S BLONDE CHICK BETTER, I'M JUST GONNA STEAL HER FROM HIM ANYWAYS. - AND THAT SHOULD DO IT. - HEY, HOW COME I DON'T GET A GIRL? - YOU NEVER SAID YOU WANTED ONE. - WHY WOULDN'T I? - WE CAN ADD IN ONE MORE CHARACTER, CAN'T WE? - I DON'T THINK SO. THEN ROSS AND AUSTIN WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE STORY. - BUT IT'S NOT A REAL STORY. - WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS? WE COULD ADD IN ONE MORE GIRL BUT NOT ACTUALLY CAST HER. COOL? - I GUESS. - OKAY, NEWT, WHAT DO YOU LIKE? - BIG-BOTTOM GIRLS. - REALLY? - REALLY? - YEAH. - IT'S TRUE. - I WON'T ASK. AND OFF IT GOES. - AND SO IT BEGINS. [bombastic drum music] - WELL, THAT WAS A NIGHTMARE. - THAT WAS SOME FUN SHIT. - I JUST SPENT THE LAST WEEK IN A ROOM FULL OF BOYS LOOKING AT LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF FEMALE PICTURES AND RESUMES. - I THINK I COULD GET INTO CASTING. - BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING IN - I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE CALLED IN AT LEAST 100. - I HELPED THEM NARROW IT DOWN TO JUST THE CREAM OF THE CROP SO WE COULD ACTUALLY GET THROUGH THESE AUDITIONS. - AND I'M ONLY LETTING THEM USE THE THEATER FOR ONE DAY. [drum cadence] - YOU BOYS READY? - BRING THEM IN. - LOT OF ANTICIPATION FOR TODAY. WE GOT TO ORGANIZE TO RUN LIKE CLOCKWORK. - SO WE'RE STARTING WITH ME. MY GIRLS ARE COMING IN TO READ FOR THE ROLE OF "ABBY," THE ULTRA-SLUTTY HOT ASIAN WHORE. OH, YEAH. [clicks tongue] - GUYS, UP FIRST, THIS IS AMBER. all: HI, AMBER. - HI. - I'LL BE READING WITH YOU, SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. - OKAY. I BROUGHT A SURPRISE FOR JENNY. - WHAT? - A WHOLE BAG OF DILDOS! - NO ONE SAID THE SCRIP WAS AWARD-WORTHY. - WHAT? WHY? THIS ISN'T A BACHELORETTE PARTY. - WELL, SHE NEEDS TO GET HER MIND OFF IT SOMEHOW. - WE WEREN'T SHOOTING FOR AN OSCAR HERE. - TRUST ME, RACHEL. ONCE YOU TURN THIS THING ON AND STICK IT UP YOUR VAG, YOU'LL BE HOOKED. - SHE WAS CUTE. I'D FUCK HER BUT ONLY IF SHE CAME INTO MY ROOM AND I DIDN' HAVE TO WORK FOR IT. - SHE WASN'T BAD. - YOU CAN HAVE HER, THEN. - HI, EVERYBODY. [whistles blowing, cow bell dings] [baby coos] - NOW WE'RE TALKING. - WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. YOU'LL BE READING WITH ME. - WHO WROTE THIS? - I DID. I DID. - WE DID, ACTUALLY. - IT IS SO GOOD. YOU GUYS ARE SO AWESOME. - WELL, I TRIED. - WE TRIED. - WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. - SHE WAS GOOD AT STROKING THE EGO. I WONDER IF SHE WAS GOOD AT STROKING AT STROKING MY... - WHOLE BAG OF DILDOS? [gasps] - I'M GONNA GUESS YES. - O.M.G. YOU HAVEN'T HEARD? - HEARD WHAT? - HER BOYFRIEND IS, LIKE, [whispering] GAY. - SHUT UP. HOW DO YOU KNOW? - SHE TOLD ME SHE SAW HIM KISS ANOTHER GUY. THAT'S WHY LOLA IS, LIKE, THROWING HER THIS SLUMBER PARTY. SHE IS SO UPSET. - THAT'S AWFUL. - I KNOW, RIGHT? BUT THESE LITTLE BAD BOYS WILL DO THE TRICK. - THANKS. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW. - NO. THANK YOU. - SHE DESERVES AN AWARD... - FOR THE BEST CLEAVAGE EVER. - SHE MADE ME WANT TO VOMIT. - DOES IT MATTER THAT SHE CAN'T ACT? - DOES IT MATTER? IF SHE LOOKS LIKE THAT, SHE CAN ACT HOWEVER SHE WANTS. - WE AREN'T CASTING FOR THEIR TALENT. - NEXT, PLEASE. - GUYS, THIS IS CANDACE. - CANDACE SCHMANDACE. SHE WAS TOO EAGER. - HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING? - STOP BEING PATHETIC. - NO, YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. [giggles] - AND THEN CAME THE TRIPPER. - OOPS.
