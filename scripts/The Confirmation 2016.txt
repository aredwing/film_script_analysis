Just praying. Well, pray properly. Have you thought about your sins? I think I thought about them enough. Well, go get in the confessional, then. Be quick, 'cause we have to go. Skip some sins if you have to. He'll get the point. Look out, boys 'Cause I'm a rollin' stone That's what I was when I first left home (truck fires up) I took every secret That I'd ever known And headed for the wall Like a wrecking ball Started down On the road to sin Playin' bass under a pseudonym The days were rough and it's all quite dim But my mind cuts through it all Like a wrecking ball (screen slides and thuds) Bless me, for I have sinned. "Father." Huh? "Bless me, Father." for I have sinned. I think it's been eight weeks since my last confession. These are my sins. Yes? What are your sins? I can't think of any. Are you trying to tell me that you haven't even dishonored your mom or your dad in the last two months? I don't see my dad enough to dishonor him. Well, must've lied to them? No. - Must've lied to somebody? - No. You're lying to me now. No, I'm not. A boy can't go that long without a falsehood. Maybe once. This girl in school, she asked me if I liked her cookies, and I said yes. Was that wrong? How about impure thoughts? You must have had some of those. What's an impure thought? Maybe you wished bad things for someone? Why would I do that? Maybe thoughts about sex? What do those thoughts look like? (sighs) Listen. No one is waiting. You think about it for a moment. Hey, Bonnie. Walt. Running a little late, aren't we? Yeah, the truck's been stalling on me. Those shit after-market parts. Are you sure you're up to taking Anthony this weekend? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I got it. When are you back? Uh... about four tomorrow. Where you going? The church is having a marriage encounter weekend. (chuckling lightly) No, no. That's good. So, um... (sniffs) you're, uh, you're back with the church again? Kyle and I thought it would be good for Anthony, so we're getting him caught up... next week, he is doing First Communion and Confirmation. You mentioned that. That's a lot of church for a boy in one week. Well, Anthony seems to like it. Oh, and make sure he gets here for mass tomorrow. Jesus. Poor kid. And he has to stay clean before the sacraments next week, so please keep him out of trouble, okay? Well, I don't know what kind of trouble he can get in in a day. Getting hot already. How's the house? Anything needs work, I can always come by and fix it. Kyle doesn't really do that stuff, does he? No. Kyle doesn't have to. He pays people to do it. Remember any sins yet, son? I'm not your son. You're God's son. You're not God. I am God's representation here on Earth. I thought Jesus was God's son. Say five Our Fathers and three Hail Marys. Okay. "Bless you, Father." Okay. I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Thanks be to the God. Promise me... No drinking this weekend. I don't drink anymore. And even when I do, it's not that much. I'm serious. We've been through this before. One more time, and that's it, you don't see him. So promise me. I don't have to promise. I just won't do it. Our Father who art in Heaven... (huffs) Hey! What took you so long? Jesus, son... how many commandments did you break? Not that many. Did you say all your penance? Huh? The prayers that the priest has you say. Did you do all them? Yeah, Mom, I said them. Good. 'Kay. I love you. Love you. Have fun. I'll see you tomorrow, all right? Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. So you learn anything in school this week? Yeah, we had to. Like what? Well, my teacher said, um, that the scientists think there might be more universes. More universes? Yeah. Did you hear what you just said? Yeah. That's crazy. "Universe" means universal. That's everything. You know, "uni" means one, "verse" means... all. There can only be one universe. Maybe I should have a talk with this teacher of yours, 'cause he's teaching you a lot of nonsense. It's a woman. Well, women are just as full of it as men, you know. You didn't know that? Kinda. (sighs quietly) I got a lead on a job. You stay in the truck. I'll be right out. (door bangs shut) (door bangs shut) (metal music blaring) (music continues) Won't say a damn thing about it, right? Oof! Hey! Watch where you're going. Where are you going, anyway? What's happening out here? Jesus Christ! - (blow lands) - Never play in this truck! Do you hear me? (music playing on jukebox) Ho, ho. Hey there. Whatcha having? I don't know. Don't know or don't care, like your old man? Hey, I told you a while ago. I'll be right out. I need to see some I.D., partner. I don't have some I.D. I'm not 21. (barkeep chuckles) All right, guys. Let me know if anything comes up. Anything. Come on. Can we go to the Hamburger Hut? Why waste money on that when I have food? I'll make you a sandwich. Pa? Hmm? What's a "hussy"? Where'd you hear anything like that, Mark? At school. Some of the girls... Aren't you going to eat? Nah. I'm not hungry. Mark: About being a hussy. What's it mean? Well, Mark, it, uh... it means a worthless woman. You mean shiftless and no account? That's right. So what are we going to do? What do you mean "do"? This weekend? They were probably repeating something they heard, son. (phone rings) Uh, I don't know. Maybe go to Otto's? Yeah? Uh-huh. Yes, I can. Yeah, I got all those tools. I got joinery, staircase... Yeah, I use the antique carving... Uh-huh? Behind the Pastime. Monday morning, 9:00. Great. Thanks. Here's something to do. I got a job Monday. Go to the truck, unlock the big box, and bring me my wood tool box. The one with the old chisels and knives? You can help me sharpen 'em. Okay. It's gone. What do you mean, it's gone? The lock was on? Yeah, but it was unlocked. You left the truck alone at the tavern. Just for a few minutes. Yeah. I told you to stay in the truck. You forgot to lock it. Sometimes, when you're drunk, you forget things. Can't you get new ones? Those are specialty tools. They're hard to find. They cost a lot of money. If Otto doesn't have some to borrow, I've got to find the son of a bitch who stole mine, or I'm screwed. So we are going to Otto's. Anthony! Hey, Otto. How you doing? Walt! Hey. We don't see you guys enough. How you doing? Good. Excellent. Come on in! No, I'm sorry. Otto, we can't stay. I just wanted to see if you've still got your Swiss files. I got a job Monday. Mine went missing. Not that nice, old set? Yeah, they knew what they were after. Went right for 'em, left everything else. All right, well, let's see what we got in the back. There we go. Oh, wait. I sold mine a while back. Well, how long? Maybe I can find them. Not long. Maybe 10 years. (sighs) I gotta find mine, then. You know who you should talk to is Guy Bishop over at Swift Creek Tavern. Is he the owner? No, he... But he's always there. He's a good guy. Retired. He knows just about everybody. He might know who would steal tools like yours. Was he a cop? No, a thief. But he's a good guy now? Better than most. Better than most thieves or better than most guys? Thieves. But he's a good guy now. He found Jesus. Well, if he found Jesus, maybe he can find my tools. - All right. - See you, Otto. - Thanks, Otto. - Good hunting. Dad? Why don't you have a job? What do you mean? I have a job. I'm a finish carpentry specialist. Well, I mean, like, all the time. Oh, I'm what's called a freelancer. I pick what jobs I want to do. Mom says you don't really work. Well, your mom is... mistaken. Wait here. I won't be long. - Hey. - Hey. Is there someone called Guy Bishop here? Yeah, good one. He's the old guy. Right over there, as usual. (panting) Let me think. Do you know Vaughn Bennett? Barely. I worked a job with him once. You think he stole them? (chuckles) No. He knows all the guys around here, and they listen to him. If Vaughn puts out the word... you'll get your tools back. What are you doing? Why were you out of the pickup? I was just... standing out there. Hi. Anthony: Oh. Hi. Hey. Is your dad here? (footsteps) Hey. How's it going? This your boy? Yeah, this is Anthony. Can we talk? Sure. Come on inside. Allen... take Anthony out back and play. Hi, Linda. This is Anthony. Hi. Hi. - (girls giggling) - That's my girlfriend. I want to show you something. So they only took the specialty tools? They knew what they wanted. There's only a handful of guys in this town who know how to use those or know their value. Yeah, that makes sense. Hell, yes, it makes sense. Any idea where this happened? Well, it could have been The Signal. Or anywhere. The Signal? I never go to that place. Too much water in the sauce. (chuckles) You know Drake? Lives in that RV thing in back of that shop place on that street right off Meeker. Off Meeker? Absolutely. Hell, yes, you know it. Well, he's your best shot at this. Drake knows everything that's going down in this town. Scary as hell, but he's whip-smart. A good guy. I'll let him know you're coming. In the meantime, I'll put out some feelers myself. Allen. What are you doing? Playing with crickets. Hey! What's the matter? You feel bad for it? No. Then you kill one. Allen: Leave him alone! He can't kill a cricket. I don't need to. Well, I think you'd better. He's crying over an insect! Look. Sorry. Tell you what. You can shoot my gun to make up for it. I got a rabbit you can shoot in the shed. It'll be fun. I don't want to shoot a rabbit. If you don't want to get beat up, you'll shoot the rabbit. Knock it off, Mike! Seriously. Put it down, you little shit! It's actually loaded! You don't know what you're playing with! Don't point that at me! Cut it out, you nut! Put it down, you little asshole! What the hell is going on out here? Little shit pulled a gun on me! Isn't this your gun? I was gonna let him use it, but then he pointed it at me. How many times do I have to tell you guys that these guns I give you are not playthings? I have a mind to take 'em all away until you grow up. Get your ass in the house. Unload this and put it away. Now. You okay, little soldier? Why did you point a gun at him? I thought it was fake. Thought we were just playing. Never point a gun at anyone. That's a rule, son. Unless, of course, they're attacking you, then you can shoot 'em all you want. I think he'll remember that lesson. Won't you? Walt: Come on. You guys should come over next weekend. We actually have a little shooting gallery we set up, and we could teach him to really shoot. He could learn gun safety, everything. Seriously. Thanks. (Walt sighs) Son of a bitch. (groans) Oh, goddamn it. You'll fit. I don't want to fit. Oh, come on. It'll be fun. Here, I'll lift you up. Come on. (grunts) Ow. You okay? Not really. (grunting) Okay. Let me know if it hurts, okay? Yeah, it hurts. Doing great! You're almost in. Ow! There you go! Anthony, you okay? (groans) Yeah, most of me's okay. So, uh... There's a jar on the dresser in the bedroom. Go get it. Bring it to the window. Okay. Find it? Yeah. Um... and there's a bottle on the floor in the closet. Okay. I can't find it. No, it's there. Keep looking! (lid creaking) There's no bottle in the closet! Okay, just bring the jar. Um, grab your backpack. Get me some shirts and a pair of pants. Okay. How can he lock you out of your own house? It's his house. I, uh... I just owe him a little money is all. He's just being pissy. So where are we gonna stay? We'll have to stay at the house. My house? Well, it used to be my house, too, you know. I rebuilt the thing from the ground up. Just don't tell your mom, okay? We'll have to leave before they get back. We have to go up there for the newspapers anyway. (starter fails to fire) (engine screeches) Do Mom and Kyle still have the wagon? Yeah, but there's something wrong with it. What? Uh, I don't remember. But it runs? Yeah. I think so. Good enough. (change rattling) Can I do it? Quick now. We got places to get. (buttons beeping) No! (gasps) You hit the damn charity button. Well, they told us to do that in Catechism. Walt: Yellow? You've got to be kidding. What happened to the shelves I built there? Kyle didn't like 'em, so he took them down. He didn't like 'em? I mean, who doesn't like custom built-in wood shelves? Jesus. I mean... half of us build the world, the other half destroy it. What the hell happened here? Kyle had an accident. He had an accident with door trim? How do you even do that? Why didn't he fix it? He did. It used to be worse. (sighs) You're living with a Philistine. What's a Philistine? It's a religion. The religion of dumb-asses. (sighs) Well, at least my, uh, cabinets are... Holy shit. Kyle? Mom says it adds character. (doorknob rattling) (door creaks) These are Kyle's tools. No. These aren't tools. These are toys. Where'd he get these, the Dollar Store? Yeah. Aw, Jesus. I was just kidding. This guy is 90% puss. Do you like this Kyle? Yeah. He's pretty nice. Well, it could be worse then. You want to get the car keys? I'll put my stuff in the bedroom. (footsteps) Hey. Got the keys? Let's go see Drake. (engine fires up) (metal music blaring) - What the hell is that? - (turns radio down) That's Kyle's music. Your mom married a metalhead? Do you like that? A little bit. Not really. Where's that CD I gave her for her birthday? (Big Dave McLean's "Don't Get Mad, Get Even" plays) That sounds better, huh? Yeah. It sounds pretty good. It does sound pretty good. Let's go find my tools. Now, when life has turned you upside-down You feel kicked to the curb You feel beat to the ground (brake pedal hits floor) Holy shit! Where'd the brakes go? - (horn blaring) - Anthony: Whoa! Oh, yeah, that was the problem. (horn blaring) ...holler inside, well, I'm willing to bet I forgot. Mom said the brakes were starting to go out. (exhales) Don't get mad, get even Solid advice I believe in And if for no other reason you know... Brake pads? 75 bucks. 275 installed. We can put 'em on now if you want. I'll put 'em on myself. Can I can borrow some tools? Let me ask my dad. You're slipping down to the end of your rope There's no flicker of light There's no glimmer of hope You're just looking for something tonight That seems a little more pleasing You should get down on your knees When you're rollin' the dice If you're willing to gamble with the rest of your life You put a smile on your face (brakes squeal) Don't get mad, get even Pretty good, huh? Yeah. It stops now. It's getting late. Guess I'll have to see this Drake guy tomorrow. You hungry? Nope. I'm starving. Pancakes. That's a very good choice. (chuckles) And your mom was worried about us. If you have a six, then you can ask me if I have a six. Oh, I see! Then you take it and make a pair. If I've already got a pair, what do I do? You put it in that pile. 'Kay. Do you have... a jack? Go fish. Go fish yourself. (both laughing) (explosions) So jab straight. 'Kay? Bop, bop. Bop, bop. Bop! No, no, no. No. No roundhouses. Bop. Keep your hands up by your face. Bop, bop, bop! Narrator: The baboons sit and listen to the hippos' distinct call... - (Anthony laughs) - as they bathe... and drink the water. The hippopotamus is highly aggressive and unpredictable and is among the most dangerous animals in Africa. Nevertheless, they are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory... (fridge door rattles) Wine coolers? Seriously? Make that 95% puss. What's that mean? Ah, that's good. 95% puss is pretty good for most guys these days. You can't take that! They'll think I did it. (thuds bottle down) (door items clattering) (exhales wearily) We have bottled water. Well, you, you stay here, I gotta look for something in the garage. (door creaks open, bangs shut) (clatter) (door slams) Did you find it? Find what? I don't know. No. (breath shaking) Cold in here, huh? You're sweating, Dad. Listen, uh... I got to, uh... I gotta run out a sec. You'll be okay, right? Where are the keys? I don't know. (exhales, gags) Want me to call somebody? No. (gulps) Go to bed. I want to stay here with you. I'll be okay. Just go. Anthony. Go to bed. Now! (groans lightly) Please help my dad. There's something wrong with him, but you can probably see that. Make him better, if you can. Amen. Walt: Jesus Christ! How will I know if you don't tell me? You know, we've talked about all this before. It's just not all my fault. Look, I'm sorry, okay? What do you want from me? Seriously, that doesn't make any sense. Why would I do that? What are you doing? Dad? You always do this. Dad? (sobs) I can't. (shouts) (Walt groans) (Walt groans) Hello? Otto! Um, it's Anthony. There's something wrong with my dad. What do you mean? - I think he's drunk. - What's he doing? He's talking to people who aren't there. All right, well, just hang on. I'll be right there. We're at my mom's house. I'll just be a few minutes. Okay. Walt: I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go. - I gotta go. - Dad. Dad! Stop! Don't go out there. Don't go out there! Dad! Dad, Otto's coming. He'll be here any minute. Otto? He says you should stay here. Is Dorothy gone? Yeah. But Otto's coming. Okay. Hello? We're in here. Hey, Walt. How you doin', buddy? Otto? Yeah. Time for bed, don't you think? Come on. Let me help you. Yeah. There we go. There you go. Yep. There you go. All right. Okay. Yeah. I'll be right back. Upstairs. (footsteps) Well... (sighs) he's finally out. You okay? Yeah. Listen, Anthony. Your dad is not drunk. He's having withdrawal. Do you know what that is? No. It means that he is acting funny not because he's been drinking, he's acting funny because he hasn't been drinking. You understand? No. Sometimes... when adults stop drinking... it makes their minds play tricks on them. See, your mother said that he couldn't see you anymore if he didn't stop drinking. He was in the taverns. Oh, but he's been drinking root beer. He's trying. Your dad is a good man. He's got some demons, but, you know... we all do. He'll be asleep for several hours, I think, and when he wakes up, he's gonna be hurting, but he shouldn't be acting strange anymore. Now, I got to get home for Beulah, but if you need me, you call me. Okay? I'll be here real quick. You promise? Yeah. All right. You're in charge. Thanks, Otto. Anytime, partner. Get some sleep, you hear? (sighs) (alarm clock beeping) (shuts alarm off) (Walt sobbing) (sobbing) (paper thuds) The Griffins get one. The Griffins? I didn't think they could read. See their house? Yeah. The gutter's falling off, the paint's shot. Garbage in the yard. You know, get off your ass and fix it. Clean it up. (sighs) When we first moved here, this neighborhood had some pride. What's the matter with people? I don't know. You know, the Griffins represent everything that's gone wrong with this world. It's immoral, is what it is. Your generation's gonna have to make it right again. It's up to you. - Okay. - You know? I'm sorry my generation screwed it up so bad. It's all right. No, not really. You know, our parents built a great country, and we couldn't even maintain it for you. I'm sorry. They get one, too. (paper thuds) (sighs) (exhales deeply) You know, I think maybe you're right. I think I can see your other universes. I just hope they make more sense than this one. I, um... I don't remember much from last night. I didn't hurt you, did I? No. - Dad? - Yeah? I don't want to have Communion. Why not? I don't want to eat Jesus. Oh... Listen. You're not really eating Jesus. They say you are. No, no, no. It's not Jesus. It's just a cracker. It is? And it's not Jesus' blood either. It's grape juice. You know, it's crackers and grape juice. I don't get it. You will. Someday. Why don't you go to church anymore? I went enough already. I don't want you to go to hell. Listen. I'm going to tell you something. Don't ever tell your mom, okay? Okay. These things that they tell you... They might be true, they might not be true. What do you think? I think that I don't know, and neither do they. No matter what they say. They don't know. So, just in case, maybe you should take Communion. What about Confirmation? Won't hurt you. You know, just do it. For your mom. And once you're grown, you can do what you want. I can? Absolutely. You know, you can skip church and listen to shitty metalheads, if you want... God forbid. Just... you know, listen to what they say, and then decide for yourself. Do what you think is right. Okay? Okay. (church bell tolling) Walt: Okay. So, while you're in church, I'm gonna go visit this Drake fella. If I'm late, just wait for me right here. I don't want to go to church. But you have to. You told me to make my own decisions. Well, not yet. Why not? I said when you grow up. You told me to think about it, and I thought about it. Well, you're thinking about it too much. Look, I promised your mom that you'd go to church. I'll tell her you took me. No, no, no, no. That's not how it works. Shit, Father Lyons. Get down. Okay, now get in there. I'll go if you go. (engine starts) Hey! You must be Walt. I'm Drake. You talked to Vaughn? I did. He caught me up. Man, I'm on it. I'm on the case, all right? This is what I do. Are you a detective? Nope. I'm a drywaller. What's your name? Anthony. Anthony! What do you do? Um, I go to school. All right, keep doing that. Make sure he keeps doing that. I got five names last night. People are already talking. - They are? - Oh, yeah! Can you help us now? It would be an honor to help any friend of Vaughn's. That guy's done so much for me. I'll co-pilot. Okay? That means I gotta ride shotgun. You cool with that? - Yeah. - All right. Let's go. Come on. Here we go. Drake: Walt, you wanna drive straight. Okay? Make it look like you're driving down the street. It's exciting, right, Anthony? Yeah. Who gave you these leads? Well, I know half the tradesmen in Kent, and I know all the thieves. All right. Okay, we're coming up on one now, so ease on up here. You know, I was worried about bringing Anthony, but this guy is an old soul. Now I'm glad he's here, because this is life experience. This is great. Okay. See the grey... Grey one in the driveway? The Grey car? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right there, right there. - Here? - Yeah. Park across the driveway so they can't pull out. Let me do all the talking. Remember the INXS lyric, "Listen like thieves"? That's what you're gonna do. I'm gonna do the talking. You're gonna listen like thieves. Here we go. Okay. What's up, guys? Can I help you? (sighs) Go ahead, Walt. Ask him straight out. Are you, uh... Who are we looking for? (scoffs) Have him tell you his supposed real name. What's going on here, fellas? Someone, uh, stole a toolbox of mine, and someone else said that you might know something about it. You're accusing me of stealing your tools? No. Yes! Walter. Don't let him smoke you. Sir, we have evidence that, if true, you know, indicts you, more or less. (laughing) Wow, this is your lucky day. You know why? Because normally I'd kick your ass right now. But... kind of in a good mood because we've been camping all week and we just got home. Drake, can I talk to you? Yeah. Yeah. Hang on, hang on. Woman: Yeah, that way. After you unload the car, let's go inside and get cleaned up. This guy doesn't look like he's jacking tools out of trucks. Yeah, I'm starting to have my doubts, so let's move his name a little further down the list. Yeah, let's do that. Good call. All right? Excellent audible. I apologize. Have a good day. I'm a Boeing engineer. How do I even get on your radar? Yeah, it's my mistake. I'm, uh, I'm sorry to trouble you, sir. That was on me. Okay? I should not have trusted the guy that gave me that name. He's a nut. Who gave you the tip? You don't want to know. All right? Here's the good news. I know all the other names on this list. All the other ones, I know them. They're in the building trades. They know the tools, okay? So let's just, uh... This guy, let's go to Central. Maybe we should just forget this. I'm sorry. This was a bad start, I know, but I want to help you and Vaughn find your man. Don't you want to check out one more name on this list? Yeah, I don't know anyone on there. It's... good! I'm glad you don't know them, because these are criminals. I'm gonna take you back home, Drake. I appreciate your help. (sigh) (car starts) You okay, Drake? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, you know, never been a quitter. Right? God, slow down. Walt, Walt, Walt! - What? - That's Freddy Johnson. His name is on my list, okay? I've known him all my life. Let me take him down. Okay, listen. He works with carpenters. He steals. His name came up from all my sources, okay? Watch this. (door opens) Ready or not, here I come! Get away from me, Drake! (both grunting) What do you know about the finishing tools stolen yesterday? I don't know what you're talking about. Then why are you running? Because you're an insane person! Hey, hey, hey. Let him up. One second, one second, one second. Look, I know that you know. Even if you didn't do it, you better start talking, Freddy, or I'm gonna mess you up. I don't know anything. Freddy, you know what I can do. Okay! Okay, okay. You know the Thuringer brothers, right? Yeah! They're on the list. They're on the list. Yeah. They took 'em. Do you know what they did with them? - I just heard about it. - From who? I can't say, but it's solid. They said the Thuringer brothers were talking about it, laughing, even. Where did they steal 'em? A tavern? Okay, let him go, Drake. If you're lying... I'm just saying what I heard. Can I go now, officer? Funny, Freddy. Yeah. So, when we get there, should... Should I do the talking? No, Walt, let me do the talking, okay? I know these guys, and they don't scare me. Well, it's just that first guy... Drake: Yeah, okay, well, that threw me off because I thought I knew who the guy was, and it turned out to be another guy. This one, I'm on it, I got it, okay? Just pull down this little... This little alley, right here. All right, there you go. Okay. Okay. Stay in the car. I mean it. These guys are slow. All right? They're dimwits, really. They'll indict themselves. - Hey, Drake, how you doing? - Hi, Drake. Drake: Walt, this is Tucker... - Hey. - And Trout. This is Walt. This is the guy whose toolbox you stole. (snickers) What? Guys, we have refutable evidence that you took the guy's toolbox. Just own up. I don't want any trouble, but I need my tools. Hey, Drake, are you on Meth again? Tucker, don't change the subject, okay? Yes, I'm on Meth, okay? That has nothing to do with what we're talking about! What the hell? We have it from a direct witness... We don't have a direct witness. We heard it. He was a direct witness... No, Drake, he was lying. He wasn't lying. These guys stole it. And it's about to get real, all right? I've had enough of this, Drake. All right, whoa. (cell phone ringing) Um, hi, Mom. Uh... yeah. Everything's fine. Um, nothing, really. Yeah, we took the papers out and went to church. Um, yeah, I'll tell Dad. Okay. Uh-huh. All right. I love you, too. Bye. (phone beeps off) Okay. Guys... let's all take a breath here. Trout, put the gun away. What? Can't you see this guy's hurting? And be nice to Drake. He's got his own problems, obviously. You know better. I'm sorry. Yeah. You will be. You will be. Okay? Drake, it's over. We got 'em dead to rights! No, not really. Okay, you know, hey, Trout, I don't care if you have a gun, I'm gonna look around. Drake! Point a gun at me. I don't care. Oh! Hi, stolen merchandise! Hello! I'm sorry, uh... I don't really know Drake. You know, uh, I mean... he seems pretty decent for a stoner. Yeah, he is. We love Drake, but he just gets some funny ideas sometimes. (Drake chattering, indistinct) Hey. Hi. Drake? Hey, come on. We'll take you home. Yeah, Drake. We wanna take you. They did it. I know they did. No, they didn't steal my tools. Okay, well, then, one of these other peop... No, Drake. This time, we're really done. I'm taking you home. It's... I just wanted to help. We know that. Not many people would've done what you just did for us. That's right. Most people can't even be bothered, you know? And I... Ahem, I care too much. That's my problem. It's a... It's a burden and it's a virtue, you know? Well, the important thing is, you tried your best, and we appreciate that. Don't we, Anthony? Yeah. We really appreciate how much you tried your best. Yeah, man, you know, 'cause that's the story of my life, is I always... I always try my best, you know? And that's where I get in trouble. This one time... You'll like this. There was this lady, her grandmother made these German apple pancakes. She wanted this recipe, she couldn't find it, so I go, there's a website, it's called "Stormfront," and it's like a neo-Nazi site. I'm not a neo-Nazi, but I figured, you know, "German apple pancakes," maybe they'd have these old things. So I started posting on there, and the next thing I know, I get this call from the FBI... All right. All right. That was fun, guys. That was fun. Um... well, you know... you wouldn't have a few bucks, maybe, for my troubles, or... I don't really have a couple of bucks to spare, Drake. Well, that's cool. You know, that's cool. Um, I was glad to help, and... okay. Drake. Man, thank you! Guys, thank you! Hey. You know what? Drop by any time you want. Come visit. And... and Anthony, keep doing school, okay? 'Cause that's my theme song, all right? All right. Bye, Drake. (engine starts) I want to show you something. Is this okay? Don't worry. They know me. Doesn't look like anyone's home, anyway. See this? I built it. It's a... Called a trellis. You know, usually, they're simple and boxy, but I... I added some carvings, did some detail work. Wow. Looks pretty good, Dad. I think so. You know, it makes a statement. Says somebody's been here, somebody cares. They, uh, they seemed to like it. I called the police! Ma'am. - It's me, Walt. - Get out of my yard! My dog is trained to attack! No, I built... Get em, Daisy! (Daisy barking) (barking continues) Are we in trouble? Don't worry. It's fine. (siren wailing) Woman: Hands where I can see 'em! (police radio chatter) I'm sorry. I was just showing my son... License and registration. See, I, uh... I built the trellis, and, uh... And your license. I'm sorry. I don't have it on me. Are you Kyle Zabler? Yes, officer. I am Kyle Zabler. And this is my son... Stepson. See, I built her trellis and... This your stepdad? Uh-huh. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to ask you to try and stay out of other people's yards. Okay? But I am gonna write you up for driving without a license. Fair enough. That trellis lady had no idea who I was. Worked at her house for a week, didn't even remember me. She should've. Maybe she's a Philistine. I liked your bookshelves, too. Kyle didn't. Did he say why he didn't like them? He didn't like the color. The color? They were pine. They were wood color. (footsteps) You try and stay out of trouble now. - Yes, officer. - Mm-hmm. Anthony: What do we do now? Walt: Got any homework? Yeah. Your report card, huh? How'd you do? Okay. "A"... "A"... "A"... Straight "A" s. Wow! Listen, uh, did Kyle have any, uh, leftover trim for the kitchen entry? Um, yeah. You want to help me fix it? - Okay. - Yeah? We'll fix that sticking door, too. You want to put a little putty in there. You see this edge here? That's called a reveal. A reveal? Yeah, 'cause it reveals some of the piece below it. You know, if it were even, it would be called flush, because it's flush. Flush. And if it protrudes, like this one, then it's called proud. Proud. Yeah, 'cause it's, uh, sticking out, like it's boastful, right? You see, uh, carpentry is only the illusion of perfection... but we can come close. They say God lives in the details. He does? Well, if he doesn't live in the details, where does he live, huh? I don't know. See, uh, bad workmanship is a sin. People don't appreciate quality work like they used to. But you... You notice things, you give them some thought, right? I think so. See that chair? Someone built that chair, and not just one person, several people helped... Remember that. Real people. You know, when you go over a bridge, think about what it took to build that bridge. Okay. You ever think about the people who made your pants? No. Well, think about 'em. Now, Kyle... He's okay for a pud, but I'm sure he never gives things any thought. Not because he doesn't care. He just doesn't have the imagination. You don't want to be like that, right? No way. Hey, Dad, can Allen come over next time? Who's Allen? The boy at your friend's house. What friend's house? Yesterday. Oh, you mean Vaughn? He's not my friend. I barely know him. I just heard he might know who stole my tools. I thought he was one of your friends at the tavern. What are you talking about? When I was going inside to The Signal, he was coming out. Are you sure it was the same guy? Yeah. Allen was in the truck. Why didn't you tell me this? I thought you saw him. He never goes there, huh? And then he pawns crazy Drake off on us? Whip-smart, my ass. You think he stole your tools? Get your coat. (brakes screeching) Where's your dad? Vaughn! (Allen gasps) What did your dad do with the tools? My dad didn't take the tools, Roger did. Who's Roger? The guy that was with my dad. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to, but my dad would've killed me. - Walt: Come here! - Vaughn: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! I'm the one who was helping you find the damn tools! Where are they, you son of a bitch? I told you. I don't know! I don't know where they are. You boys get out of here. Dad, I think you should tell him. What? Tell him what Roger said. What Roger said? Yeah, Roger said that Vaughn stole your tools. What? Now, that's a goddamn lie! Roger's the one who stole your damn tools. Why should I believe you? Allen: It's true. Roger went into your truck and took them. Dad told him to stop. You believe this boy? Where's he live? Are you Roger? What do you want? I want my tools. - Okay! - Where are they? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Don't be sorry, just give me my tools. I don't have them. I pawned them. I checked the pawn shop! No, I took 'em to Pete's Pawn in Renton. I figured you'd never go there. Give me the money. I don't have it. How much did you get? $200, but I spent it. I want the $200. I haven't worked in six months. I got three kids. We needed food. Get off of him! Get off of him! He's got heart trouble! (all grunting) - No, no, no, no! - Get off! (all wheezing) Just give me my money. We don't have it anymore. It's gone. Well, then give me something to sell. We've sold everything. There's nothing left. Are you okay, honey? I'm fine. Look. We're done here. We're going back to Idaho to live with my parents. When we get back on our feet, I will send you the money. I need the money now. That's not gonna happen. Look, he stole your tools, and that was wrong, but we're broke. Look around here. Do you see anything worth selling? The only thing we got left is that mower, and it don't even work! Come on, Anthony. Let's go. Roger: I'm sorry. Write down your address and I'll send you the money. Walt: Forget it. I'm coming with you. No. Hey. How you doing? Hey. Are you the owner? Pete! Yeah? Got a guy. Hi. Yeah? Those are, uh, my tools. They were stolen. Right. You got a receipt? They're very old. They were my dad's. I don't have a receipt. Well, that's your problem, then. Well, I can tell you everything that's in there without opening it. Yeah, I got guys coming in here all the time, claiming stuff is theirs. Those are my tools. Then call a cop. Or a lawyer. Maybe you didn't know before you bought 'em, but you know now. Those are stolen goods. Well, call the authorities. We'll have an investigation, then. That's how things work in this country. Walt: How much did you put on them? 400 bucks. - Anthony? - Hey! What are you doing? Come back here! Anthony! Run! - Run! - Get out of the way! Keep running, Anthony! Anthony, run! Get the kid, Darren! (blows landing) Anthony... Anthony: Stop it! Leave him alone! Leave my dad alone, goddamn it! (scuffling continues) Get away from my boy! What are you doing, huh? Get away from my boy! (grunts viciously) You! You don't even think about coming back here, 'cause I'm not selling you these tools for any price. Now, go on. Get outta here. Are you sure you're not hurt? You got blood, Dad. Oh, I'm okay. Come on. Let's go home. (Gillian Welch's "Everything is Free" begins) Everything is free now That's what they say Everything I ever done Gonna give it away Someone hit the big score They figured it out That we're gonna do it anyway Even if it doesn't pay (exhales) They got pop. You want anything? No, thank you. Me neither. I'm back! Hey! Great timing. We just got home. - Hi, bud! - Hi. How are you? Good. Um, Dad's here. Hey. Hey, Walt! Hi. So, how'd it go? Good. Wouldn't you say, Anthony? Yeah. Good. Nothing happened. Well, come on in for a minute. Sit down. You haven't seen the place, have you? Well, I, uh... I'm sorry, I mean, since you lived here. (chuckles) Yeah, I haven't really been here since, uh... - looks good. - Yeah. Sit down. Sit down. Here. So what did you two get up to this weekend? Um, just messed around. Played some video games. At Dad's house. Really? You have video games now? Yeah, I got 'em for Anthony. But I enjoy 'em, you know. It's fun to kill aliens. (laughs) Ack-ack-ack-ack! Did you get enough to eat? Yeah. We ate some. How about I'll make a snack, and we'll have dinner later? Good? Hey, Walt, you want to stay for dinner? No, I'm good. Thanks. Ahem. Hey, Walt, do you want to see my ham radio? No. I mean, you know, maybe someday, but not today. Ahem. Hey, Walt. Bonnie tells me you've run into kind of a rough patch, and I want you to know, that if you need any money or anything, don't be afraid to ask us. That's very nice of you, Kyle, but, uh... I'm doing okay. Great. I just want you to... No. Thanks. Okay. (sniffs) I really like what you've done with this house. It's really nice. That's much appreciated, Kyle. And those kitchen cabinets? Gorgeous. Well... ahem. We had a great weekend. Yeah. We had a good weekend. We learned a lot about, uh, how to show appreciation for one another. I don't mean just physically. (chuckles) No. No. It's all about communication. Telling the truth. Just be honest with each other. That's what the experts say. Isn't that right, partner? I don't know. Hey, Walt, do you want a beer? You have beer? Yeah, I keep it tucked away in a little fridge in the garage. None for me, thanks. Would you mind if I had one? Okay, I'll just go get one, and I'll be right back. (door opens, Kyle thuds) Kyle: Whoa! Jeez. What happened to my sticky door? Walt, can we talk outside, please? Buddy. (door opens) (door shuts) What were you doing in my house this weekend? When I, uh, brought Anthony over for the newspapers, I had to go to the bathroom. You always fix the door trim when you go to the bathroom? Not always. I'm sorry, I... I came in, I saw the bad work, I couldn't help myself. Right. And I suppose that made you so hungry, that you had to make pancakes? (scoffs) Hey. Why don't you have a seat, bud? What's the money for? It's for Dad. Why? I don't want to say. I know he was here this weekend. I know everything that happened. That's why I want to give Dad the money... for the car. The car? For fixing the brakes. Your dad was driving my car this weekend? I thought you knew. How much were the brakes? $75. But then there's labor. For his time. So... $325 for his time? Yeah. That's probably fair, don't you think? I think so. Is there anything else you want to tell me about this weekend? No. That's about it. It was actually pretty boring. Okay. Um... Do you think Dad can borrow the car for a few days? Until his truck gets fixed? Yeah. All right, what the hell? Kyle? Um, do you mind if, uh... Walt took the wagon for a couple of days and put new brakes on it? We talked and he said all good, right? You really don't mind? I'd be happy to help. Great. That's nice. Thank you. Here's the keys. Okay, uh, I'd better get going. Uh, Dad? Remember, you said you'd take me back to your house to get some stuff I forgot. Is that okay, Mom? Okay. But no messing around. Just there and back. Okay. I'll see you later. Hey, Walt? I really enjoy seeing you. Thank you for fixing the car. You bet. (door opens) Okay, buddy, what's going on? Now we can get your tools back. Where'd you get this? Mom. Oh, no. We're taking it back. Well, it's for fixing the car. You weren't supposed to say anything. Uh, she said, um, she was gonna ask you to fix it anyways. Really? Yeah. Let me borrow your phone. There's no way that guy will sell them to us. Mom and Kyle will help. No. I can't do that. (line ringing) Otto isn't answering. (line ringing) I know. Go that way. Stay here. I'll be right back. Give him the money, Dad. (engine starts) Okay. So you know where they are and what they look like? Yes, sir. Just say it's for your dad's birthday. (door shuts) Hey! I should've known it was you! Darren! Darren! (engine starts) Hey! Come back here, you! Hey! Stop! Stop! What happened in there? When I went in, he was talking to a man, so I went right for the tools and took them and ran. Let me, uh, take a look at these. Thank you, Allen. Thank you so much. (no audible dialogue) Allen: This is good. My dad, he's probably still passed out, but if he sees me, I'll get in trouble. Um... sorry I hit you with the glove. Hey. Maybe I'll take you and Anthony to a game sometime. Sure. This was fun. Bye. Bye, Allen. Bye. We should make one more stop. Bless me, for I have sinned. It's been one day since my last confession. These are my sins. I lied to my mom and my dad. I stole... a lot. I coveted. I said bad words. I didn't keep the Lord's day holy. I shouldn't have lied to the policewoman... or pointed the gun at Mike. Um. Let's see. Um... What else? So... what do you want to do next weekend? Next weekend is First Communion and Confirmation. Oh, yeah. You gonna do it? Yeah. For Mom. Are you gonna come? Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there. For sure. Where are you gonna stay? You know, may... Maybe Otto can put me up for a few days. Um, I got a paycheck coming at the end of the week, so, you know, I can get my house back. That's good, Dad. Mmm. You were right, Dad. It was my fault. What was? I left the truck alone. Oh, no. No, Anthony. It wasn't your fault. No, I left it unlocked. It was me. Your dad messed up. Hey! You're a good boy. You know? You did good. You got my tools back. So, um... see you next weekend? See you next weekend, buddy. Hey. You behave yourself, now. (laughs) (car door shuts) (engine starts) I can remember Those days as a child When life was a treasure Filled with wonder and joy The simplest of things Were filled with such pleasure And love was a virtue Time could not destroy Oh I still need these things to believe in To protect my heart From the rain Something's gone wrong The old feeling is gone Lord I need a change A change in the way That I am living A different way to deal A change in the way I perceive this old world Oh I need something that's real These days, I wonder What's become of that boy? I know he has traveled On many dark roads How can a soul Wipe clean of the sorrow? And how can a heart Unburden that load? I still need these things to believe in That protect my heart from the rain Oh, but something's gone wrong The feeling is gone And, oh, Lord I need a change I need a change in the way that I'm living A different way To deal A change in the way I perceive this old world Oh I need something that's real Oh Lord, I need Something to feel Oh, something to feel
