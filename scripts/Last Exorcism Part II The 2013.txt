Hey. - Hi, I'm... - Freak. So are you from a cult in the woods or something? Come here. Sit. Just sit. Oh, I don't know. Are you sure? I mean, better than anything you've heard in the backwoods. Trust me. There. What is it? We all have pasts. Like it or not. It's just a part of who we are. You can't change it or run from it. But you can own it. So as an exercise, I want each of you to write a letter to someone who's hurt you and confront them. You can say whatever you like. Just be honest. Just own it. You're doing much better the past two months. The new job all right? We're spraying 222 for bugs. So let the plastic be. If anybody asks, we're redoing the paint. Pretty good.

I was pregnant though. But I think they took it away. Well, at least I thought I was. See, I told you I was nuts. I should probably go. ...On the second date? He went down on me on our first. Nell! Telephone! What is wrong with you? You're a slut. It's a boy! - What? - Dirty girl. It's probably nothing. - Yeah. - Sure. Oh, my God. She has no idea what that is. Hello? Hello? Hello? Chris? Chris? Chris, are you there? Chris, are you there? Chris? I want to be inside you. Nell. Nell? Daddy? He's coming for you. If he can seduce you, he'll be free. Turn off the fricking light. Shut up! Hey. I called last night but you never picked up. Stop. Hey, what happened? Everything's wrong with me. Bull. Wait. What do you even like about me? I don't know. You're just... I'm not good at this either. I miss you too. Chris? No. I can't. Come on. One sec. Yeah, one sec. Chris? Chris! Chris. Chris? Chris, come on. Chris? We're not Chris. It's okay. It's okay.

Before they did. Before he did. If he seduces you, all hope is lost. Just know... Just know that the good Lord forgives you, and you can be saved, Nell. - He's told me. You can be saved. - Yes. - You can be saved. - Yes. I never should've trusted that preacher to do what had to be done. The fate of the world hangs in the balance. I have to stop him.

Please! Stop it! - What's going on? - It's him. He's... Please. It's all right. It happened. What happened? They won't be as kind in a psychiatric hospital. I am not crazy. - Nell... - I know what I saw. Come on, don't let this set you back! No, just listen to me! Please! Gwen wasn't Gwen! It was him! Just like in Ivanwood! Enough! If you keep this up, I'll be left with no choice. I'm sorry. In a week, you're gonna look back at this with a little perspective, okay? Stop touching me! In a week, we'll probably all be dead. Hello? Hello? Stop! No! And I say, put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand the wiles of the devil. For while we wrestle not against flesh... What are you watching? What? We're watching you. I don't understand. What is that? I don't know. That's not me. Obviously that's not me. Oh, it's you, all right. I saw a picture. - You look just like your mother. - Really? Yeah, I saw the painting. Oh, thank you so much. That's such a compliment. She's so beautiful. Were you very close? She was my best friend. Yeah. That's safe to say. She was my best friend.

We all have pasts we wish we could undo, kiddo. But I hope you know, in your heart, that that video is not you. It ain't real. Those people, that cult, what they did, that doesn't define you. Only your actions do. You gonna be okay? I'll be fine. Please, Lord. Please. Please show me the way. Miss? I'm sorry, sir. I was just... It never hurts to ask for help. Yes, sir. And it's lonely, isn't it? Fighting a losing battle. Day after day. When you know you can't win. You're just putting off the inevitable. And for what? For what? What good comes from resistance? When all you have to do is ask for his love. Let him into your heart. Yes. See, all that fighting and resistance just seems so wasteful now, doesn't it? It's all right, child. He's patient. And you can't run from him. Sorry, sir, can you please let me go? There's no place you can go. There's no place he won't follow you. After the fall, comes the rise. And he has great plans for you. He will set you free. Please, let me go! Let me... Let him into your heart. He will set you free! Believe in him! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, lady! That's unbelievable! I'm sorry, do you need something? The video. The way you bend your body all around like that. That's amazing! That shit's amazing! - I gotta get a picture with you, okay? - No. I'm sorry. Come on, it'll only take a second, please.
