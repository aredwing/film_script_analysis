Yes!...And neither one of them are responding. Alright. This isn't good. I'm gonna kill her! Ohh.. I hope she's ok. Mhmm. If she's ok.. I'm gonna kill her. Alright. You want me to look for her'? Where?? I don't know.. Ben's house... The dock. Is that the garage door? Oh thank god. Honey maybe we should wait until tomorrow to yell at her. No? Of course not. Oh my god.. I'm sorry mom. Ok listen. I don't even wanna hear about what time you may think it is.. Because anything you say to me is just gonna make me even more.. Pissed off! Mom, I had a really rough night... A rough night? A rough night so rough that you couldn't even text me to tell me that you were were alright.. Or at least respond to my thirty texts! My phone was on silent I didn't even...

It's different this time mom! Please... trust me. Trust? Trust! That is not a very good word to be using with me right now young lady! K.. Mom, why aren't you listening to me? Please. I said me and Ben.. broke.. We broke up... Ok Jo.. you know what? Everybody has crap that they have got to deal with and you know what that doesn't mean that you neglect your responsibility! Jo you are an adult. You have got to start acting like one! Ok I'm supposed to be up at college right now and you have no idea when I got home.. how this any different? Ok! I'll tell you how it's different! It's because you are home! Oh I wish that you were off at college but you're not! Do you know why? Do you remember why you're not at college? 'Cause you got hurt. Now there's no more track and oh yea.. By the way you don't even know if you wanna go back to school again.. oh that's real mature Jo, real mature... "Ok, Dad? Please" You even said wait until I have a better idea... Uh huh! Oh no! Don't you dare play us against each other... we are both in agreement that things are going to change around here, if you are going to stay under our roof everything is going to change, in fact you know what? You're grounded.. From this moment on, you.. Are grounded, besides work, you are not going anywhere for the next two weeks... and you know what else you're gonna do? You're gonna finally get that freakin' phone that I told you to get a week ago! ...Are we perfectly clear? Yes... May I go to bed now? Go on... Go on! Hey kiddo... Ben's at the door again... Can you just tell him I don't wanna see him again? You know what... no. Maybe you should go tell him yourself. I have told him like a thousand times. Well then at least hear what he has to say... Dad... I didn't want to talk to Ben, I didn't want to see Ben. Alright... message received. Loud and clear. Well that was awkward... I know... I'm sorry. I just wish he'd leave me alone. Well then.. You're gonna love this! Oh... my... god! He's so desperate... It's sad. No what's sad is the fact that I wasted so much time on him! I know. You're still not reading them right... No. There's nothing to say. Nothing. God it's killing me! Aren't you curious? I don't.. I don't wanna see them.. I don't wanna know about them, I don't wanna read them... I, don't care. But you guys have been together so long! Don't you wanna know? I don't wanna know what he has to say! I'm done with Ben. I'm so done it's not even funny. The fact that he.. Honestly.. I don't. I don't even wanna talk about it anymore. Can we please talk about something else? Let's talk about your love life.. Ok, between you and me are you still in love with him? Ok, Nick! Are you not listening to anything I just told you? No! I hate him. God I fucking.. Shit! Shoot.. shoot.. You just said a bad word. Not right now, Brandon. Gonna tell. Brandon, stop, stop. I just totally cursed in front of him and I didn't mean to. Miss Jo, Miss Jo, Miss Jo, Miss Jo! Miss Jo! Miss Jo! Miss Jo! Miss Jo! Miss Jo! K, What?? What?? Ice cream truck is here, we need money. K, Nick can you hold on what second please? Watch your brother... I know! Watch him please. I want my own ice cream. I guess you are getting to be a big boy aren't you? Alright Mr. Big. Here's your money.. I want you to stay right with your brother though, ok? Alright, what was I saying? How change is a good thing. Yea exactly I've given three years of my life to this guy... And this is how he repays me? I mean.. Now I just feel like it's a big mistake and I'm just ready to move on. Alright! Let's get you moved on! Whoa, when I say moved on I mean for myself. What the hell?? I'm just saying that you thought. No, no not you. It's little E.. I swear to God if Brandon did something to him.. Nick I gotta go. Elliot, baby, what's wrong? What happened? You still have your money, you didn't get your ice cream.. Did B do something to you? B! What happened? What happened! Elliot? I don't know he just ran away. Ok, you were out there, I told you to watch him, tell me exactly what happened. I not know! Ok, I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna find out what happened. Get me my chocolate. Don't shoot! Hello? Hello... You must be the big sister. No, I'm actually just the nanny. I was gonna say you looked pretty young to be a mom. Actually I was gonna say you were pretty sexy to be a mom. No, I'm actually just the nanny. Sorry if I scared the little guy.. Most kids like my faces. Yea.. he's... a little shy. But.. Well we can fix that. What's his name? Elliot. Oh but really it's.. Well you tell Elliot, if he wants to come out here and give me another chance, I got something special just for him. Actually, I just wanna talk to you about what just happened. C'mon.. he won't be disappointed. No, no.. really I wanted.. Where the...? There you are. What...? Ok. Maybe he talks to me senorita. They call me.. "El Groucho..." I love burritos! Do you like, burritos? You don't love, senorita? Tell Elliot to come out and I make him laugh! No. I don't think he's gonna come back out, I think he... you scared him a little bit... you're kind of freaking me out too right now. Asshole! Hey! Hey! What ya doing? Look I know you're bored and can't leave the house but please don't take this out on me... No. No, I'm not bored at all. Clearly you're bored. No. I mean, I'm angry. Well good! You should be angry. At yourself. Dad, you know Mom over reacted the other night... ok? No! I don't know that. You know just because I wasn't yelling doesn't mean I don't agree with her... Well... Get over here! Alright, has anyone ever told you what happens when you scare the babysitter? Anyone ever tell you that? Nobody ever told you that? So too bad you... So too bad you... Fine she can have fun with you while I have fun with... um... Love ya babe! Thanks... 'course you do. He was so mad! Sounded like me though. I worked on it, I worked on it, I practiced. It was good, I liked it. Thanks. Shh, do you guys hear that? The ice cream truck? Yep. That's him.. You guys have got to see this guy... K, first of all he called himself Willie Kool... Oh I've seen him... with the paint! Yea... he looks like a monster! Yea... no, that's nothing, you have to hear him talk. He scared Elliot so much he won't go back out to get ice cream anymore. Oh this is the guy? Mhm... So I go out there to see what happened between them and he starts saying like how young and sexy I look... Yea... And then once I tell him that Elliot won't come back out... this guy just drives off! Just up and out drives off and I'm just standing there like... What the fuck? Shh... Listen to his music. Sounds like a psycho. Let's go see him! No. There's no way I'm going back out there. No. I don't want him knowing where I live. C'mon chicken shit! Nuh uh... I don't want him knowing where I live... No. How 'bout you? No thanks, I'm good. Are you serious! Fine! Guess it'll just be me alone with the scary ice cream man... Maybe your little brother will come with me... Help protect me... Oh my God she's really going out there. She's crazy. Come here... Now watch him, he makes all these really strange faces. Looks like Nikki found a new friend. What is she doing? I told I did not wanting him knowing where I lived. Too late. I'm gonna kill her... I'm gonna kill her. Ok, wait a second... Alright, now make the goofiest face ever. Perfect! Look. I love it. Elliot why don't you stay right here, ok? Don't move. Ok? Ben what are you doing here? I told you that you can't come here. I'm sorry... No! This is my job Ben... and you can't just come here. I know you told me. I just... You haven't answered any of my calls. You won't talk to me. And you think this helps? Did you get my letter? Yea... What? You don't have anything to say? I haven't even read them, Ben. You haven't read that one or you haven't read all of them? No, I'm sorry, I haven't read any of them... You're serious? Yes! After everything... After everything we went through you won't read one letter from me! Yes! Because you put us here Ben... You put us here. I still think we can fix it. Ben sometimes you can't just fix things, ok? Sometimes when you break something you have to accept that it's broken... You have to understand I'm not... I'm not one of those people that can get past something like this. Ok? I believe people are who they are... and unfortunately this is who you are. Would you hear me out? If you just let me talk for a minute... You don't have to forgive me and you don't have to forget anything I did. Fine. Talk to me Ben, whatever it is you possibly feel you need to tell me. Alright? 'Cause once you're finished so are we. No, it wasn't! Do you see this as a misunderstanding or something? Oh, I made a mistake but I didn't mean it. I see it as so much more than that... You betrayed me, Ben. Don't you see how bad you hurt me? I know. You have to believe me Jo... I'll never forgive myself for hurting you. Hurting me? Hurting me, Ben? Ben, you killed me! You killed me, Ben... I will never be the same person I was, she's dead. She's dead. I just can't stop picturing you with her. Miss Jo! B, c'mon babe! Do you know where Elliot is? K, I'm in the middle of something important, c'mon. Check his room. He's not in his room... Did you check... Oh my! Elliot was out front with us when you came here... right? Yea. Was he out front right when... Oh my God! Ben, help me find Elliot... now! Ok. Elliot! Elliot! Shit, shit! Elliot! Elliot! Ben, go around that and meet me over here! Elliot! Elliot! Damn it! Jo, how long after Ben arrived did you realize Elliot was missing? I... I don't know. Maybe forty-five minutes. Ben thought it was only fifteen to twenty minutes... Now, that's a pretty big difference. Look we were in a heated argument, and I'm sure Ben lost track of time. I just know it was a long time. Is there anything else you can remember'? Did he say anything... Did he ever wander off with a friend before without first getting your permission? No, no, he was a... he is a shy... he's a shy homebody. Then why are you so confident he went down to the dock? Because, that's where he liked to take his walks. Where's the sheriff? Over here. We just pulled this from the river. Oh Jesus. Is this Elliot's? Yes. Was he wearing it? I... I don't know. Mrs. Walters, this isn't anything for sure. No! No! Oh no! My baby! I'm so, so sorry. Yea no she doesn't want anything. Well you know, I'm just gonna make some anyhow and just in case she changes her mind and David will eat it if she doesn't. How is she? She's hanging in there. Breaks my heart to see her like this. I know. I know. Maybe you should go and talk to her. What would I say? I told you so? I mean I've been harping on her so much lately and anything I say would... just sound disingenuous. I guess there's not much we can say... just let her know we're there for her. Jo. Jo, can I come in? Jo. Please Ben, not right now. You know your Dad said I should talk to you. Remind me to thank him later. I know I'm the last person you wanna see light now. I just have to tell you how sorry I am... About everything. And I know you told me not to come over... I just feel like... everything that happened is my fault. This never would have happened... if I just listened to you. K, Ben I know this might be hard for you to understand but... Listen I can't run from this. I can't keep making excuses for myself. No matter what you did it was my job to take care of him. And I failed. I'm not making excuses. I knew Elliot and I feel horrible. God. I just can't believe he's gone... You know you don't even know that. He could have made it to the other side. Maybe wandering in the woods somewhere. I know it sounds far out but... We could go looking for him... and it would be that crazy. And at least you'd be out of here and you'd be doing something. K, stop it Ben. No, this is the child predator capitol of the world. K, Ben you're not helping. Actually... while I was waiting for you to come to work, me, Trey and Josh were on the rope swing... and there was this guy out there... this strange guy. We thought he was pretending to fish. Wow... a strange guy? Fishing? I know. Listen, listen to me. I did a super fly off the top and I almost landed on his line... and there was nothing on it, there was no bait, no lure... So I started watching him and he just kept casting his line out over and over but there was nothing on it, he never put anything on it... I just kept thinking, dude you're not gonna catch anything that way! What did this guy look like? Hey. Hey. Where's Mom? She took David shopping. She'll be back in a little bit. It's good to see you out of your room. I keep hoping to wake up and this will all just be a bad dream. I know kiddo. I know. What happened Dad? I mean honestly it seemed like just last week... I was gonna get a track scholarship, school was great, running was great... Ben and I were... we were happy. And now... God... I just want my life back. I know baby. It won't ever be like that again will it? No I'm afraid it won't. Nice pep talk Dad. Well wait, what do you want me to say? Everything's gonna be great... Life's gonna be wonderful again... Look this is gonna be really hard. Because you really feel... and you really care. And because of that you're really gonna have to go through this... and all the emotions that come with it. It's gonna be tough. But I know that you're tough... and your Mom and Dad love you very much... and we're gonna be here for you no matter what, ok? Ben cheated on me Dad. Oh God... I'm sorry baby. I mean that lead to Ben coming over... to us fighting... to Elliot. If that didn't happen... I'm so hurt, so frustrated. I know, I know baby. If that didn't happen everything... would be so... would be so different now... in so many ways. No, no, no, you can't look at it that way, baby you can't. Life's a constant battle of what ifs... But thing's happened. You can't spend your time wishing you can go back and change this or change that 'cause you can't. What you can do is you can focus on what happened and what your role in what happened is, and you just try to grow from there... try to move on. That's really all there is. I just don't know if I can forgive him Dad. I know, I know. You know what you need? A job with your best friend. I'm sure I could talk to Michele about getting you on here. Yea, that would actually be really fun but... I don't know what to do right now... my parents are finally giving me space to figure things out... Finally. Then I think you deserve that... but I think you should come here with... me. Honestly? I was thinking about moving to Colorado for a little while... just to live with my Aunt. Just to... clear my head. No. No, no, no, please don't I mean I totally understand... but no please don't. Wait hold on one second. Chocolate shoe... Jess... this is Ben. I need to talk to Jo. She's not here. I know she's there. Just put her on the phone. I don't think she wants to talk to you. Will you just ask her'? Will you tell her it's important? Apparently you're not safe anywhere... Want me to tell him to get lost? Just tell him I'm busy. She's busy... and just for the record Ben... I think it is really shitty what you did to her. But Jess, everything you're telling me I tell myself over and over again... Please... you didn't even tell her it was important. Tell her it's what we talked about the other day... I found him. He says it's important and he... found him. Who is he talking about? Ben, what do you mean? I'm sitting here looking at the back of an ice cream truck... it says Willie Kool's Ice Cream. K, Ben if you're just doing this so that I'll talk to you... That's not it. I wanna see if it's the same guy. Where are you? Hey. Hey. You look really good. Thanks. So how did you find him? I have my ways. One of Josh's friends called me up... told me where he was. I had everybody and their brothers looking for him. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna drive up next to this asshole. No, I don't want him to see me. Then why did you come? I mean... I wanna see him, I just don't want him to see me. I think that might make this really difficult Jo. Ben, why are you doing this? What does that mean? I mean are you just doing this so that I'll talk to you? No, I'm not doing this just so that you'll talk to me. Because I believe something happened to Elliot. I really believe that. Wanna... find out what. Really? Yes. Ok, he's moving. K, let's stop... Stop. Stop! Can't stop Jo, we have to see his face. Ben, I know it was him, I can feel it was him! I don't want him to see me! C'mon we need to see his face, it's gonna be ok. Alright look at me. Ben, stop. Stop! Was that him? That's really strange. Why what happened? It looks like him. He's just covered in make-up. I knew it! God! I knew it! I think you should go to the police. Jo and Dad. Hi. Sheriff. I assume you're here for an update but unfortunately... there's not a whole lot new. As you know we found the other shoe... but we still haven't found the body. Actually Sheriff we're here because. Jo has some information that might be of interest to you. K, Jo, what do you have? I think that Elliot didn't just fall into the water... Really... I don't know how this is going to sound but I think somebody might have taken him. That's very serious... Why do you think someone would have taken him? A very strange ice cream guy that drivers around the neighborhood and about a week before Elliot went missing he was driving around the Walters' house and I let Elliot and his brother go out to get ice cream by themselves... and I'm not exactly sure what happened... but Elliot came running in as if he had seen a ghost and I don't know what he did or said but it scared Elliot to the point where he really freaked out and he came inside. But you don't know what he did? No, and I went out there to figure out what happened but... by the time I could even talk to this guy he was all over the place... I mean he was making strange faces and trying to be funny... and calls himself Willie Kool and I mean... there's just seriously something not right about this guy and I really wanted to talk to him but... yea I just couldn't and... this sounds kinda weird but I had this really, really horrible feeling that he wanted to hurt me. Why are you just bringing this up now? I was talking to Ben... you remember Ben? My boyfriend... well ex boyfriend... and he said that he saw a guy at the dock before Elliot went missing and that it could have been the same guy. Tell him about the fishing. I am. Ok, so Ben said that this guy wasn't really fishing at all... like he didn't have anything on his line... like it was as if he was just stalking out the place. Alright look... This is very interesting... but we really need something more to go on than you think you saw someone fishing who looks like a guy who sells ice cream. K, Sheriff... I know, I understand but there's just something... not... right... about this guy. Look I have his license plate number so you can check on it and everything. So you want me to... check out Willie the ice cream guy... because you have a bad feeling about him. Not just a feeling, the fishing like I told you. Alright... There's one thing I can do... I'll talk to the guy, see if he was fishing that day... and if he noticed anything unusual... But I'm not investigating him based on what you've told me here me today. We found his personal items in the water... There's no indication of foul play... and there's no sign he made it to the other side of the bank. This was a little boy that wandered away... down to the river... fell in and drowned. Let me tell you two something... this was an accident... a tragic accident... but an accident none the less. I wish there was something I could do for everyone involved in this thing... It's horrible to lose a child like this and makes us all sick to our stomachs... but unless some... viable information, evidence, comes forward... we can't have people running around making wild unsubstantiated comments. Do you understand what I'm saying here? Do you understand what I'm saying here? Yes. Yea, we got it. Alright. Mrs. Walters... I'm so sorry about everything that happened and I am... JO! Stop. Please, stop. I don't wanna hear your apology! It means nothing to me! Jo... Jo, I trusted you... I trusted you with my children... and because of that... my baby is gone. Anything you say or do will not change that... I hope... I hope one day... When you have a family of your own... You will realize... the magnitude... of how you... destroyed our family. I would appreciate it... That if we ever cross paths again... that you do whatever you can... to not look at me. Don't speak to me... Don't speak about Elliot... or our family ever again! Let us be... dead to you... As you are to us. That is all you can do for me. There is a hole... Prettiest little hole... That you ever did see, that you ever did see And the holes in the ground and the green grass grows all around, All around, the green... Ben! Shut up! Ok. Close your eyes. No, I'm not gonna close my eyes. Ok then. God, I knew this was a mistake to come. It's gonna change your mind. What is this? This is where he lives... WHO? Willie. What! You know nobody believes you... I'm the only one who thinks something happened to Elliot. Ben, what are you saying? We find out for ourselves... By doing what? By breaking into his place. Are you crazy Ben? No. I'm not. This is the only way. Yea.. it's the only way to get killed. I've been following him... I've been studying him Jo... I've been reading about child killers... and he spends all his time in his place... and they keep things... they keep things like souvenirs and if we could find something... they would have to take us seriously. Ben, I can't even look at him through a window and you're expecting me to break into his house? I'm not asking you to do anything... You're going to do this by yourself? If I have to. No, no. I'm not letting you do this Ben. I'm not asking for your permission. Ben, c'mon! My God this would be crazy! Please! You know I'm not just doing this for you... This is about "lil' E." When are we doing this? Tomorrow night. Jesus, I'm scared. He's getting in his truck. What if he comes back? He's not going to come back. He's a security guard. He'll be gone until morning. We could stay in there all night if we wanted to. I can't stop shaking. Ok, he's leaving. You ready? No. That's my girl. Let's do this. Wait, wait, how we gonna get in? A hammer. Ben, I can't go in there, please I can't go in there. Go wait in the Jeep. If I'm not out of there in two ours call the police. Ok? No, Ben. I don't want you going in there, please! There's nothing you can say! I'm going in there. Fine let's just do this... Let's do this. Ok. It's open. What? Oh shit! Ben, maybe there's somebody else in here... c'mon let's go home, please! We're not going anywhere. C'mon. Oh shit. Jo, come here... What? This guy is fucking insane. I know he did it. C'mon I wanna go. Fuck! What's wrong Ben? Turn it off Ben! I'm trying to turn it off! Turn it off Ben! Turn it off! C'mon we have to go, put it down now we have to go! Ben, put it down we have to go! What was that! It was an alarm! An alarm? Of toys? Yes! Please Ben it was... I wanna go home now! We have to back in there Jo. No, Ben please start the car! I wanna go home now, please! We have to find something, I'm not leaving without it. Please start the car, please! Please! Take me home, please. Please start the car! Alright. Keep the lights off. Can't I can't see anything. Oh shit! Go! Go, backup! Go, go! Alright! Ben, go! Alright, I'm trying, ok! Ben, now go! Stay down! Stay down! I'm trying! He didn't see us, ok? Seriously we're fine. I saw him! Just stay down, ok? Oh my God! Here's to another long night... Waiting around I know that you are... gone... Somewhere babe... So here's to another love lost... If only I found a star to make a wish... Upon... To bring you... Back... But it has to be... It has to be... This way... And I have to be... I have to be... The one... Who came... So... how far... How far... How far... Where I am... To wherever you are... Uh... excuse me... can you tell me how to get to a street called "Wynkoop"? Wynkoop? Um... I'm sorry that doesn't sound familiar. It's supposed to be around here... Hold on a minute I have a map. I can't read these stupid things. Right here is Wynkoop... I see seventeen and also two-twenty... but I can't see where they meet... Can you look here and tell me if you know where this might be? Um... I mean... Well this is becoming a little tradition for us, isn't it? Yea I guess that it is... Where's Dad? I wanted to do this alone. Well Billy... Detective Sims... said... you had something new for us? Yes. Jo... why are you doing this? I mean c'mon... I'm on your side here, I have a daughter that's almost your age, I know how I would feel if something like this happened to her but... this has got to stop... this case is essentially closed. Why are you doing this to yourself? I mean... Me and Ben broke into Willie's place. Excuse me? K, we didn't actually break in we... You can't! Nobody was home. Are you seriously sitting there telling me you broke into someones home? I didn't want to... I didn't wanna do this at all but I... You can't! You can't break into someone's home! That's not how we do things around here. That's how people get hurt. Listen, I know, I know it was stupid... Stupid? It was a felony! You should have been arrested. I should arrest you light now where you sit! What were you thinking? Where was your head? I wasn't thinking... You just... don't know when to stop. He tried to kill us! What? He tried to kill us. I thought you said he wasn't home. That's what we though, we thought he wasn't home. But I think he was waiting for us. Let me get the sheriff. "Sheriff Anders' office..." Where's the sheriff? Alright. Don't go anywhere, don't move! I'm glad you came. You know you can take your hood off... Really... I said I'd protect you, alright? Jesus, where did you get that? It's my Dad's. What did the cops say? They said he disappeared. They said that he's long gone and that he'd probably never bother me again. You don't believe that, right? No. What are you gonna do? I don't know... Honestly, I was thinking of moving to Colorado for a little while. Colorado sounds nice, I could do that. I don't think that was an invitation. Since when do I need an invitations? God. Just knowing that there's somebody out there trying to kill you... it's almost too much to handle... really. I can't eat, I can't sleep... I know I'm going crazy, light? I think you've always been crazy... that's why I love you. Wow... I haven't heard you say that in awhile. I didn't think you wanted to. I didn't. What about now? I don't know Ben. I don't know is better than drop dead and see you hell. Ben, just stop talking, just for one second. Please. Ok. I don't know how I feel right now... I still hate you, Ben. I do. I'm still so... so hurt and I... I'm scared that I'll never be myself again. [Sighs 1. To know that the person that you think loves you more than anything in this world... who can hurt you so bad... it's almost unbearable. You know I... I can't thank you enough for everything you've been trying to do. Everything- You know I might not have understood why, or what happened but... I think... I think I know who you are... and I think you're the person I always thought you were. And... I wish I could tell you that everything could be like it used to but I... I don't know if that's possible. Ok, but I... I miss seeing you... being around you... I miss you Ben. Can I say something? Yea. I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'm not asking you to forget what I did. I just want to move forward... and for better or for worse I wanna move forward... and I want you to know that for the rest of my life I will always do the right thing for you. You know that? Yea. I'll be a better man because of you. Ok, too fast... I don't even know him Nick. Hello? This is how you get to know him. We're just hanging out, I didn't say you had to fuck him... unless you want to. I know but I told you... me and Ben are trying to figure things out right now. Ok, listen to me for a second. You guys aren't back together, right? No. Ok! Then there's nothing wrong with meeting someone, right? God, after everything that's happened you deserve to at least see if there's someone else out there that you might hit it off with. I guess you're right, I don't know. My God! You've literally never dated anyone other than Ben! That in of itself is just weird! And now that you're a free woman and you finally get the chance to meet this really awesome guy you're hesitating. No! You're doing this! I'm not letting you do anything else. Alright, I guess... but we're just strictly hanging out right? Mark my words little lady, everything in your world is about to change. Oh God. Uh huh. Hey let's look at these. Oh no... Oh no... Yea! No. No. No? It's cute! How about that one? K, are you looking at my face? I look drunk. Now go back. Go back! Right there. Ok, obviously you're not looking at me either I look like a crack head. No, there's somebody standing in the background, look! Where? He's here! WHO? Who do you think! Baby you're losing it you're letting your dream... No, you don't understand he know who I am and he's following me! Get up! Get up now! Ok! Fine, fine... Please take me seriously! Please! You took away all my stripes... And broke off both my wings... So I'll find another tree... And make... David, you asshole! What! It's Daddy, baby. I talked to David and that's not gonna happen again. Ok? Ok. How you doing? I'm just upset. You know what, let's go to lunch... Just you and me, ok? We can talk. I would I just already made plans with Ben. Really? Yea. Is that a good idea, Jo? Yea. I told him I would. Thanks Dad. We love you, ok kiddo? I'm sorry it took me so long. I had to make sure I wasn't being followed. I swear to God everybody looks him to me now. I didn't even tell you about yesterday. Ben? Ben! Ben? Oh my God. Ben! Be", no! Ben! [ Muffled 1 No! Jo! David, have you seen your sister? Mmm, nope. Seen your mother? Mmm, nope. Have you got started on the garage yet? Mmm, nope. Get your butt outta the chair and get started on the garage young man! I saw that. The fee for the garage just went down ten dollars. I'll get that. Oh and if you see your sister tell her I got her a new phone I just need to get her a chip for it. C'mon! C'mon. Are you ok? I'm sorry I had to tie you up... but we don't know each other yet... and we need to get to know each other first. But I have some really good news. I have a really... good surprise for you. Elliot! Come here, baby! Are you ok? Yea. You sure? Did he hurt you? No. Ok. See I told you. We were gonna have... a beautiful family. We're gonna be so happy together! All of us. Yea they... uh... they haven't heard from Ben since yesterday. You don't think they could have taken off together, do you? No... She wouldn't just leave her car at the dock and not tell us. I don't know what to think. What are we gonna do? I'm gonna call the police... I guess... maybe they can help. C'mon! No! Elliot, I'll be right there! Elliot stay back from the door... stay back from the door. OK? Elliot! Elliot be brave, ok? I'll be right back, ok? I'll be right back, so you be brave, ok? Willie, come get me! Come get me you bastard! C'mon! No! No! No! No! I know it's only a couple letters but it's still contact... from her! She could be saying hello. I haven't seen or heard from my daughter in almost two days and you think she's just saying hello Dad? It's contact! She got in touch with me by text message. Dan, try to stay with me here. You've got an adult daughter that's gone through some very bad stuff. Stuff that makes most people do some very stupid things... things like running off with her boyfriend. No. No, she would not do that to us, I'm telling you. Dan, you wouldn't believe how many times I've heard that line... trust me... give her some time... she'll relax... she'll cool down... and she'll get in contact with you. Or she'll just come home. Ok? Sheriff, can you just this for me... can you tell me where these text messages are coming from? Messages are coming from? The phone company is not going to give me that information but they'll give it to you. Jo! Josephina. What name do you prefer me to call you... baby? I prefer it if you call me Will. Or maybe William if you're angry at me. William you get back into bed right now! I'm just being silly. You would never be mad at me... Ok... then. Let me tell you where you are... You are currently right smack in the middle of the Okeefenokee Swamp. Okeefenokee, Okees-fenokee, Okeefenokee Now seriously... You are surrounded by swamp water in every direction! And in that swamp water is a whole lot of gators! A whole lot of... Alligator! Snapping turtles and a whole lot of... Water moccasins. Not a place I would wanna be in a pair of... skimpy shorts and no weapon. But I must say... Honey... You look great in those shorts... The only way out... is through me... Jo. Oh my! I almost forgot to tell you about the spiders... big nasty wolf spiders... they like to jump up at your face! So cover your eyes if you see one about to jump! Yea I'm still here though I'm still trying to figure out if they can tell me where the texts came from. As far as they're concerned she's an adult that left home. I gotta go, sheriffs here. Ok. Her phone was bouncing off some towers about forty-five miles west of here... just out of Lake City. The phone company triangulated the signal down to this area... we feel that she may be located in this radius. Now let's stop playing games... and just get back home! Elliot misses you! I miss you. If you come back now we'll start over as if nothing happened. I'm starting to get angry now Jo! I'm starting to lose my patience! Jo! Jo! Goddammit, answer me! Fine! If that's the way you want it you selfish bitch! I guess Elliot and I mean nothing to you. If you don't care about Elliot then I don't care about him either! Did you hear me? You don't care about him... then I don't care about him. It's not going to end well Jo, it's not going to end well for anyone! This is your last chance! I'll be sure and tell him that... it's all because of you! You deserted him, again! Alright, alright! I'll come back. Honey, there you are. How do I know you won't hurt him? But you have my word. You're going to have to do better than that Willie. Sweetheart... Please, I'm not your sweetheart! I know who you are Willie! You're insane! I know what you did to Ben... Well I'm afraid that... if you can't trust me then I just don't think things... What are you doing? My artwork. Why? It's to commemorate your beauty. Why are you doing this? It's an expression... of my love for you. Why are you doing this to me? Because I Love you. Isn't it beautiful? Yes. It is. It's because you're beautiful. It's kind of hard to breath... can you take it off so we can talk a little bit? Alright I'll take it Off. But you're not gonna run, right? You're not gonna try to get away from me are you? No. Ok. Thank you. They're beautiful drawings. Thank you. Where did you learn to paint? I've been doing it my whole life. I started when I was a little kid. Why did you kill Ben? I killed Ben... because he kept getting in the way of us. And, he didn't respect you... he didn't care about you... the way I care about you. He cheated on you. Is that the kind of man you wanna be with? Alright, that's her. That's her going to college. That's her boyfriend Ben. You sure you haven't seen either one of them? Woah! Well... no offense you being her daddy and all but... if a pretty little girl like that came through here... I would remember her. Alright. What about a Jeep? It's a four by four... yellow, kind of hard to miss. Mmm, nope, nope, nope... not ringing a bell. You know maybe you outta call the police. Well is there any other place they would go if they were staying... or hiding any place around here? Woah, woah, woah, woah! Hiding? You said nothing about hiding... now you can hide anywhere... there's abandoned mobile homes, there's campgrounds... Hell you can go hide in the woods... but... No. They wouldn't know about anything like that. What do you mean? You see... they built this military style boot camp... you know for the screw ups... and those kids that can't listen to ya... they closed it down about a year ago. See this little boy got killed... gouged his eyeballs out... ripped out his tongue... you don't need to know all that now, do ya? Ok. I would never do that to you. I love you. I've loved you since the... first time I saw your face. You're so beautiful, you know that? You're so beautiful... And now you're gonna be a good girl, right? Not gonna run again? No. I like you better when you're good. Instead of bad... Hey. Sorry to bother you I... my daughter has gone missing and... I was wondering if someone saw her or her boyfriend, here let me show you a picture. He drives a yellow Jeep it's kinda hard to miss. No I haven't seen anybody around here for a couple of weeks... the camp has been closed for awhile now. I know... she... sent me a text and it's pinging from this area... so I'm just checking everywhere, you know? Sorry buddy, I can't help you. You know what, can I give you my business card? If you see the four by four or any sign of them you give me a call? Dan O'hare, business consultant... Well Dan, if I see your daughter I'll be sure and tell her you're looking for her. Ok... Thanks. Holy shit. Holy shit. Is that really how you wanted to introduce me to your father? Fuck you! So you have a little cell phone on you! That's a very naughty girl! Fuck you Willie! Fuck you! Blake County Sheriff's Department, how may I help you? Yea, I need to speak to the sheriff immediately. You want me to put you back in that room?

The police know who you are too. I just called, they're going to be here any minute. Well that was very stupid of you. Josephina hates cops! She said she would never be taken alive! She's just a child... let her go. Drop the ax. I'm telling you to let her go! I'm telling you to drop the ax! If you hurl her I swear to God I'll fucking kill you.

There... shhh. No, don't... listen... no, no, no, no... be still... you have got to be still. You're ok. You're in the hospital... You're ok... you've just been asleep for a couple of days. K, but you're gonna be... alright. Actually, young lady you're gonna be just great! I know... you're not supposed to talk... they said don't talk. Oh! I got a pad and pencil for you and you can... well actually it's a pen... but you can write down anything you need to tell me. Hey, are you hungry? You've got to be starving. Poor baby... you really don't remember anything, do you? Your dad is just fine. Actually he's right upstairs. He was so brave! You were so brave! I'm so proud of you. He's fine... Elliot's fine. He's home. Everybody's thanking God for you, for your daddy, what you did, it's amazing! Jo, the whole country is talking about it, it's crazy! Don't you dare say that you were sorry to me... I'm the one that should say sorry... for not listening to you, for not really hearing you! It took me almost losing you to realize how much I miss us. Do you remember how we used to do everything together? I couldn't stand the thought of losing you. I'm so sorry.! I'm so sorry I've been so angry with you. Jo! If I lost you I couldn't bear it... I'm so sorry... I'm sorry! Please forgive me. What? It's... it's taken care of... it's done. We don't have to worry about him anymore... I knew immediately that she was just trying to protect me... Afraid to tell me the truth... They say with the amount of blood that he lost that it's impossible that he could have survived... but I know different. I know he's still out there somewhere... and I know that he will come back for me one day. That's why we have decided as a family to move away and start a fresh life far away from here... But I had to come back to our spot... one last time... to read all the letters that you wrote me... to remember how we used to sit here for hours and talk about nothing... I can't tell you how much these letters mean to me now Ben... to hear your words... to see and to touch what you wrote me... I think that maybe if I would have read this earlier... somehow... things could have been different. Everyone keeps telling me how it was a miracle that I lived... that it was a miracle that a cop just happened to be in the area responding to a false report... but I like to believe that you... you somehow were responsible for him being there... but who really knows, right? What happens after life? Is there a heaven? Are you watching over me? Can you hear me right now, Ben? I remember my Dad telling me that you loved me by the way you looked at me... what I would do to see you look at me one last time... to see your eyes... to hear your voice... to feel your touch one last time. I know life goes on, and I know I have to figure out where I'm going from here... but I know that you will always be with me... and I will always love you, Ben. Always. Woah-o-o-o, Woah-o-o-o, Woah-o-o-o-o oh-o-o Oh I lack money and I lack class I couldn't care less about the price of gas My heart stays cold but that's alright I can't have fun without starting a fight Baby, at my job, they call me the jerk And I shot my boss because he told me to work Advice you give will pass right through Truth be told I don't care about you! Woah-o-o-o! Woah-o-o-o! You're gonna break, break, break, break my heart! Woah-o-o-o! Woah-o-o-o! You're gonna break, break, break, break my heart! Oh I know now I'm going insane I'll paint the walls with my no good brains People passing couldn't have a clue Just what it's like to be around you Well I ignore the things you told me I don't know what it's like to be lonely No time to think about the way I feel Well I don't care about the way you feel!
