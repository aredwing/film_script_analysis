Did you know dolphins are the only mammals that engage in gang rape? - Really? - Seriously. Flipper the Ripper. Stupid fish. Can someone turn those stupid fish off? Where are you going? Can you switch off that noise? Can somebody switch those bloody dolphins off? What's wrong with him? He refused to eat his veg. Stop that. Come here. When did you say you'd quit? When you start. Summer, 1989 somewhere along the Dutch-German border. Why not? It's the best place. This is the living room. He needs his rest. It is my house. But if you take him in, you have to compromise, Paul. I'm happy to. I'd do anything for Martin. I want the best for him. - Are you sure you want him here? - Of course I do. Then let's sort this out like adults. Theo, I just think this would be the best place. Dear Paul, he needs to be able to look out, or he'll get depressed. Well, Martin? - Right. I decide: Here. - Fine. Everything out, so the bed can go in. Drat. The brakes are still on. Please be careful, gentlemen. I still don't get why you're moving in with that git. I have no choice. It's either my brother or a nursing home. And I made a deal with Paul that we won't talk about God. And he plays chess. And that's about all. Jesus H. Christ. I suppose you could always talk about music. Not being able to listen to music again ornot being able to read? Reading. A day with Kafka or a night with Kim Basinger? Kafka, of course. Ah... A new bicycle or a second-hand Solex? Well? - He's bought cowboy boots. - Who? My dad. Tragic. Tragic? It's stupid. Who goes running around in cowboy boots when they're fifty? He won't be running around at all. Mine was allowed a motorbike. - Allowed? - By my mother. Losers. Does it botheryou? Cowboy boots. Of course it bothers me. Cheers. Hi. Well? How's he settling in? His bed wouldn't fit through the door. Better this way, right? Yes, much better. Absolutely. - I meant that empty spot. - Sure. Shouldn't you take up a sport? It would do you good. ...about refugees from Eastern Germany in Hungary. Hungary is turning into a refugee camp for Western Europe. Isn't it sad? No one wants to ride him anymore. That's because he bites, mum. That pony's crap. Look who's here. - Are you still here? - Let the little children come to Me. How long will you be at His feet? Until He relives me of my suffering. Relieves. Next week they'll take out the window in the vicarage. Hey, pipsqueak. - What's on the menu? - Wild boar droppings. How's your mother? I see. So what have you been up to lately? Chemistry test. Homework. Watched Miami Vice. And I went to the pub with Heidemarie and Froukje. Who names their child Heidemarie, for heavers sake? Heidemarie's dad. Thanks. We no longer have a ladies' team, as of last year. Oh? Too little interest. So now what? You could join the boys' team if you wanted. Hey, ladies. Stop moping around. Do you know anything about baseball? Nine field players, three in the outfield. That guy with the cap is our pitcher. I'd like to tty for catcher. Catcher. Right. Funny bike. Funny hairstyle. You can put a runner out by tagging them or the base before they reach it. And with a forced run you're not allowed to return to yourlast base. Correct. - I don't smoke. - Me neither. Except for this last one. Smoking a packet of tobacco in one go... or eating 20 toasties in a row? You can't smoke that much tobacco in one go. Twenty toasties then? Twenty toasties or a bucketful of mayonnaise? - What kind of bucket? - Snack bar size. - That's impossible. - Twenty toasties it is. Miami Vice or Derrick? Miami Vice. The A-Team or MacGyver? The A-Team. Madonna or Samantha Fox? Samantha Fox. Bush or Gorbachev? Bush. Here, let me. To school with no clothes on... - orto the supermarket? - Supermarket. Let me see. - Put some butter on it. - It doesn't hurt. This will fix it even better. - He didn't. - Did too. Didn't. Did. Didrt. Did. - Blue? - Yes. Blue. - He has blue hair? - Suits him though. Is he a Smurf? O Papa Smurf, what are you doing? Hey. Hi. I happened to be passing by. My moped broke down, just round the corner. I see. - I could do with a lift. - Where to? Somewhere exciting. I still have a class. - A class? What class? - Latin. Planning a holiday to Latinia? You used to be able to see the Martini tower from here. But now the trees are in the way. What's overthere? That's where the Jerries live. I happen to be half German. Really? In that case, I'm sure you'd like a beer. Armpit or ear? Armpit. Don't look. No, come on. Yourturn. Snog or kiss? - What are you looking at? - Nothing. Young lady. Chewing gum, bin, now. Report. Dirty slag. Nena? Theo. Tests must show whether his hearing was affected. But it appears to be less serious than we expected. As this wasn't his first suicide attempt, we are keeping him under observation. What do you mean, it wasn't his first... No more than half an hour. - What did he mean, not his first... - We'll talk about it later. Did you know about this? Nena. Nena. - You teach physics, don't you? - Yes. Is it that easy? Is it really that easy to electrocute yourself? Excuse me? He cut the cord of his shaver. Look. In alternating current... But do you have to stick the cord in your ear? Or did he botch it? - Did he use two wires? - I don't think so. Why? You need to stick two wires from the same cord in both ears. One in either ear. Otherwise it doesn't work. - Loser. - Excuse me? He would have needed two hands. Staal. An A. Excellent work. Back to work. We'll be looking at the Sturm und Drang movement. Hey, gorgeous. Shut up, you fag. Your parents are in a house that's on fire. They're equally hard to get out. Who would you tty to save first? My mother. Before I'd get my dad into his wheelchair, the whole street'd have burned down. No. He's already in his wheelchair and you could easily wheel him out. You have to choose. Well? Should I choose what I want, or what he wants? - Nena? - Yes? You know where I keep the condoms, right? Jesus, mum. - Plus, they are past their expiration date. - Really? We'll have to get new ones then. - We? - Yes. Fun. Have you heard anything? About? About Martin. The first time he tried using pills. The day after he got diagnosed. You were just seven. A truck driver found him. In a parking lot. The next day I took you to that theme park, remember? That day was on the best-days-of-my-life list for ages. What would you do if you could change the past? - Warn my mother. - Against what? Against my dad. Then you wouldn't have been here. Here you go. You're late. And? It wasn't all that good. The film. The hospital called. He can go home tomorrow. Home home? - Home. Here. - No. Would you like an egg too? Yes, that would be nice. - Do you get it? - What? That someone can actually do that? That he can orthat he wants to? That he wants to. Too little against, too much in favour. Do you think I'm the only remaining item on his 'against' list? - I'm feeling sick. - Me too. Keep knives or other sharp objects away from him... steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the Lord. Good to have you back. How's your mother? Why don't you call her yourself? In Holland, Christian and Social Democrats are to form a government... led by former Prime Minister Lubbers. Representatives of both parties indicated on TV yesterday... that an agreement had been reached... but was awaiting official consent from MPs. The wave of refugees leaving the GDR for Austria and the FRG is increasing. One day after Budapest decided to open up the border... over 3,000 people crossed over into Bavaria. Can I have one too? A further 10,000 people are expected to follow. You said you'd quit when I started. ...be staying in emergency camps or travel on to relatives orfriends. The refugees are on average 27 years old. Foreign minister Horn made clear... Hungary would extend free entry for GDR-refugees by one week. He told a Madrid newspaper in an interview... that they had been trying to persuade people to return to the GDR... but that Hungary decided for a humanitarian solution... when the number of people crossing the border continued to increase. Horn further indicated... that Budapest would like to end or alter the agreement... to restrict the freedom of movement of East German citizens. Thousands of East Germans continue to make their way into Hungary. Carlo? Carlo? Greatest pitcher of all time. He out did himself in the World Series of 1971, against the Baltimore Orioles. He pitched two full games... allowing only seven hits and two runs in 17 innings. Until 1973. Never managed another decent ball. End of career. What are those pallets for? I'm going to build a loft bed. - A loft bed? - I need more space. You could pull the plug on this inflatable island. Go away. Bugger off. To think he was born to save the marriage. What went wrong? My father decided he wanted to poke his dick into someone else. In this guy Sander, to be precise. That's what went wrong. I actually meant with him over there. Oh, Steve. Why could he no longer pitch? He started to think. Couldn't stop. Thinking. You must never think too much. You must tty to sense and to be. In order to feel. Strike. Next one's for you. - Nice butt, tiger. - Strike. Stay cool. Strike three. Come on, get a move on. No worries. Just carry on. - Hey. - Hello. Didn't realise they let him out. It's not like he was in prison. Show us what you've got, butt fucker. - Wide. Pitch out. - Don't think. And go. Charming. - Hey, shit stabber. Give us another one. - Shut up, pisshead. Hey guys, save your language skills for Scrabble. Now let's play ball. Go. - Don't let him get to you. - He needs to shut the fuck up. We're playing ball here. I can do without this. - Just concentrate. - He's winding me up. Don't let him get to you. What the hell? You nose'll be fine. You, go shower. Off with you. - That girl just hit him. - And why? He slagged her off. - She's hypersensitive. - And that gives him the right? Don't talk to me like that. Hello. - I cannot shake your hand. - Oh, right. I'm sorry. Excellent job, by the way. - What do you mean? - Giving him a bloody nose. The ump doesn't see it that way. Even if something cannot be condoned, it isn't necessarily undeserved. - I'm taking this up with the league. - O, who cares. - Give them my regards. - Stupid fuck. - Are your parents separated as well? - Yes. But not far enough. Thank you. - Want some? - Just a tiny bite. Chew. Dad? - Theo, do something. - Don't panic. One, two, three. Are you okay? Knight to E7. And? Uncomplicated. Stupid, you mean. Pawn to C6. No, I mean uncomplicated. And? And... He's going to break your heart. He can't. You already did that. Sorry. Okay. Pawn to B5. Oh, no. Bishop, bishop. To touch is to move. - Check. - Yes. One... Two... Three. Are you alright? Hi, professor. Nice wheels. Hey, Carlos. What are your ambitions, apart from a new colour for your hair? - Electrical engineering. - I say. Ormaybe installation technology. - Where does that get you? - You can go into plumbing. Orboth. Like my granddad. He was a plumber and an electrician. - Are you alright? - Everything under control. - It's slowing down. - No, it's not. Yes, it is. Cramp. Break it, why don't you. I think it's out of juice. What now? You push. See. It works. There, in the desert, in the middle of the night... after exactly 40 days, I met my Maker. Back in Germany, I... Back in Germany, I quit my job to follow my calling. - Berufung? - Calling. Right. That's great. A calling. Yes. Wonderful. He bought it, you know. From the municipal council. For one German mark. - But what... - He plays at being a vicar. In a highly decorated Reformed church. Does he get people in on Sundays? What? Was that a stupid question? I think that the extraordinaty success of the novel... is a result of Goethe's authentic writing. The fact that he worked his own experiences into the stoty. Except that he failed to take the final step of committing suicide. Authentic is not necessarily autobiographic. Here, suicide appears to be much more... the embodiment of the fundamental right to freedom... that no authority can take away from people. - O brigkeit? - Authority. He wrote it in the space of one month. A person who's had more than his share of suffering... is capable of unbelievable feats. And in Dutch? At meal times, we converse in German. You do. What was that? You converse in German. She doesn't. And why? One needs to know foreign languages to know about one's own. - Says who? - Goethe. - Goethe? - Yes. I thought you made it up yourself. Goethe? What was it that he sang? Isn't that Goethe? ...his proposal to the refugees to return to the GDR... to be allowed to leave over the next few months, was received sceptically. While yesterday over 150 GDR citizens left the German embassy... today their number totalled no more than 50. Meanwhile, the numbers seeking refuge in the embassy are growing. Vogel's offer will only remain valid for the next three days. Over to Prague... I need to get home. Hello. A package for you. Thank you. ...in Poland, the GDR's foreign minister was told by diplomats... that refugees from the GDR in Warsaw were free to travel. The embassy will issue travel permits for some 1,000 refugees on Monday. I wouldn't use arsenic. That's vety painful. Says who? My chemistry teacher. I see. I thought you'd dropped chemistry. I'm still trying to decide. - Between biology and math B. - Math B? You're too stupid to for electrocution. And those pills were not a big hit either. So. A gun or cutting your wrists? A gun. - A gun or a bag over your head? - I don't want to suffocate. Pawn to D6. Gun or jumping off a bridge? - Jumping? - Driving. Drowning also means suffocating. They say it's a good way to die. Bishop to G4. Same as freezing. Gun or train? Train. Train? Yes. A gun is not so easy to come by. - Bad news for the train driver. - True. Bad enough? Bishop to D1. You could make a banner. One that says 'sorry'. Check. Oh, dear. King to E7. - Train or gas? - How? - In a car, using a hose. - Train, train. Train or... Do you need anything? Cigarettes. Me too. Or life? Check mate? Train orlife? Your hand is in mine... for as long as you keep it there. Rilke? Kafka. Shit. Will you hold me? Come. And now? Now it's over. Waste of time. A carnival song. Did your parents know? Seriously? They named you after a carnival song? - My father's from Venlo. - He's a fascist. Excuse me? Heidemarie as we're marching on the Rhine Heidemarie and we're sampling the wine then I wish I had on my knee like the rest of my company a girl that can kiss like you Heidemarie German marching song. That's where yourname comes from. - You cannot ask that of me. - Why not? Because... It's simply not fair. - Why not? - I'm your brother, Martin. So what? Talk to your doctor. Maybe he could... Paul, you know a doctor wouldn't do that. Because it is illegal, Martin. I have... Oh, damn it. - I didn't take you in so that you... - Hey, pipsqueak. Nena. What's going on? Paul is worried he'll end up in jail if he helps his brother top himself. Am I right? It goes against everything I stand for, everything I believe in. And you? Why don't you do it? Me? Coffee? I don't drink coffee. What do you want to do? See a film? Go to a restaurant? Climb the Martini tower? But I can't take you out like this. Dad. Come on. It's not funny. Hip, hip... Hurray. He doesn't want cake. He wants to die. - Let's stop now. - No. Throw me another. Come on, throw. What's wrong? Nothing. He's right. - Who? - Steve. Alright. Steve. Think too much and everything goes wrong. So what are you thinking about? I've given up thinking. Five Jet Fighters. Hello there. Hello. Hello, gorgeous. Are you here on your own? With your two planks? Are you going to build a den? Can I stay the night? I'll help you. - Keep your hands off my planks. - What? I said: Keep off my planks. Come and get it. Good Lord, what's happened? - Are you her father? - No, I'm not. The young lady has been charged. - What with? - Being drunk in public. Assault. That face. - Insulting a police officer. - You should see your face. I see. I will pass it on. In winter's cold they'll catch their death... both the drunkard and the lech. ...marching from Alexanderplatz across town. The protestors sang the Internationale and chanted Gorbachev's name. Initially, the police kept their distance. Later, the police came out in force to disperse the crowd. Protest marches also took place in Leipzig and Potsdam. Do not cry when the rain pours down I will always be by your side marble and iron turn to dust but our love won't turn to rust everything comes to an end but we'll remain true know that even when I am gone you will never be alone marble and iron turn to dust but our love won't turn to rust everything comes to an end but we will remain true. Here? We're way too early. Travel fever. I'm not a virgin anymore. Oh? I thought you should know. Okay. And? None of yourbusiness. What's that? A cap. - I don't need a cap. - I think you do. Nena, take that thing off. No.
