Arms dealer found dead in a graveyard outside Moscow. The murder of Russian arms dealer Andre Sukhorov... ...has again thrown up this dangerous question. Did Sukhorov possess a suitcase nuclear bomb? And if so, where is it? Both the United States and Soviet Union... ...have acknowledged producing nuclear weapons... ...small enough to be carried in specially designed backpacks... ...during the cold-war. These bombs, identified in Russia as KV series... ...have the explosive power between... ...three and ten kiloton of TNT. The bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki... ...were 20-30 kiloton each. But the value of the suitcase bomb lies... ...in its ability to be easily smuggled across borders... ...transported by means widely available. And placed as close to the target as possible. A single suitcase bomb can devastate... ...ten kilometers of a modern city. It will kill everything within a three kilometer radius... ...and the radiation will subsequently kill more. Gentlemen Sukhorov is dead I've heard the bomb is up for sale This is what every terror group in the world is looking for. This could start World War 3. If this gets into the wrong hands, millions will be killed. I was thinking billions. Comrades! Lt's my friend Dmitri's birthday. So we all have a drink, okay. Make drink.

And this can be... dangerous for your health. Comrades. Come. We take drink. Bring champagne. This is Colonel. My partner and friend. - Hi. Five man army. - Yes.

I can hear raging fire and roaring rain. You are in Chaman. Impressive, Mr. Nawaz. Even at this age, you still have keen ears. I can even hear what's happening in Morocco. I just heard that David Kazan has bought a nuclear bomb. What? Where did you get this news from? Mr. Nawaz, you will have to share your source with me. Because if there's any truth in this... ...then we'll need to cooperate. Tell me, General. Are you involved? I have no idea. I didn't know at all. If I had any clue about this... ...then I would have called you myself. Look, Mr. Lftekhaar, whatever the problems between us... ...this cannot be the solution. Thank you very much. Give me 12 hours. I will call you back. Goodbye. Cancel the inspection. We will return to Islamabad right now. Hello. Cancel my trip to China. And call an emergency meeting... ...of all the section chiefs tomorrow. Specially section Q, okay. Fine. Take lftekhaar sir's convoy to the Turkhum border... ...and blow it up with a launcher. I'll keep you posted, sir. Breaking news. ISI chief lftekhaar Ahmed killed in a bomb blast. Is this Zaheer's home? This is Zaheer's home, but he is on the terrace. Thank You! You're welcome Who are you? I am Freddie. Freddie Khambatta. - What? Yes. I am Freddie. If you are Freddie then who is he? So you were telling the truth that day. You are a RAW agent! Who is the Colonel? Where is the bomb? - That's what I came here to find out. I thought you knew about him. She's trying to confuse us. Where is the bomb? I am on your side. I work for the British Intelligence. And you killed that British agent? I didn't kill Richard. He was my handler. I went there to inform him about you. To show him your face. You killed 40 people in London. You were smiling as you got out of the car. You were smiling. I was smiling, because I was happy. It was a beautiful day. Boss, why are you listening to this nonsense? I am responsible for the death of those 40 people. Because my own friends... ...had planted the bomb in my car. I was waiting for them. If I wasn't feeling hungry... ...and hadn't stepped out... ...then the blast would have killed me... When one of the group was caught in Pakistan... ...then ISI chief lftekhaar Ahmed came to see me. He was convinced that I am innocent. He convinced Richard. They said that they will help me... ...but I will have to work for them. They sprung me out ofjail... ...and sent me to Morocco, to Kazan. Kazan buys drugs from terrorists, and supplies arms. So you are an ISI agent? I just report to lftekhaar Sir. He knows the truth about me. Last month I intercepted Abu Nazir's phone call from Moscow... ...that Freddie Khambatta is arriving with $50 million. I informed Richard, that's why he came here personally. Can you prove this? Talk to lftekhaar sir. He knows me. Lftekhaar Ahmed is dead. He's dead? And Richard too. Now there's no one left to prove your story. Zahir. Come here. He's one of them. Now he knows about you. Shoot him. No. I cannot kill anyone. Not even him. I don't know where the bomb is. But the Rubaiyat is the trigger. The bomb is useless without Rubaiyat. And right now Rubaiyat is in Kazan's safe. If you believe me then let me go. I know the combination of that safe. Otherwise go yourself. But for God's sake get that Rubaiyat out of there. Let's go. Come on. 20 minutes. Good luck, Iram. She was lying. You believed her? She was telling the truth. Yeah Iram. I have the Rubaiyat and the location of the bomb as well. Meet me at Golden Farah restaurant, in 20 minutes. "My friends deserted me." "My love deserted me." "Life's so..." Indian? Oh, good. Number one. Goodbye to Morocco. Indian? - Yes. I am Suresh Krishna. That's funny... My name is also Suresh Krishna. By the way, I work for the United Nations. Deputy Health Commissioner for Africa. Is this a joke? I am the Deputy Health Commissioner for Africa. We need to ask you some questions, Mr. Shastri. How are you feeling? I am hungry. We found Mr. Kazan's address in your pocket. He's dead. His house has been burgled. How do you know him? - I mean him in an auction. Don't disturb the patient please. Officers. Please step outside. I need to examine the patient Officers. I will see you in some time. Good morning. - Good morning, Doctor.

Where is she? Where is she? Riga. Riga. Do you know where they are? Look at that man closely. Anton Brega. Considers himself a Casanova.

' 'Just a minute. Just a minute.' 'Hold it.' 'Sir, I am Freddie Khambatta.' 'I am a flight purser.' 'Abu gave me a $10 note. What was his name? ' 'I don't know his name. He beat me.' 'He took the dollar I was supposed to give you.' Colonel had taken my phone away. I snatched someone's phone from the airport toilet ...and tried calling you. How will you face three armed men with one bullet? Don't be afraid. May God give your husband a long life. It's stopped. Come here. Where did you get this? - What is that? Where did you get this? - I don't know. What is that? Where did you get this? - I don't know. I am telling you, I don't know. Dr. Suresh Krishna. Dr. Suresh Krishna? We are waiting for you Sorry, sir. This is portable X-ray machine no. 311. Maybe the colonel lied to you.

Five marriages. Couple of kids from each marriage... But the cable snapped. - What? One of the cables of the ropeway snapped. We were in Mussoorie, on a school trip. The entire cabin was dangling on one cable. A sheer 2000 feet deep drop below. The other cable could snap any moment... Plunging us to our death. And then I climbed up. I clung to a rope for eight minutes. And managed to secure the cable. I was 15 years old. I got a medal from President Venkatraman. Those eight minutes changed my life. I always wanted to return... ...to that place between life and death. I am still hanging from that cable. The day I let go...

I work for Pakistan. Who do you work for? This bug... Tell me? The longer you take... ...the more fun it will be for me Don't worry about me. I am in my own country. You leave. Good bye. There's another spy here. Find him. This is him. Listen... excuse me... I am sorry. We've found the spy. Come on. Listen to me. Your partner's been caught. You are a traitor. That's why Gen. Lftekhaar never trusted you. I am sure you are responsible for his death. How do you know General lftekhaar? Leave me. I haven't done anything. What... what is happening here? I haven't done anything. I swear. I was only eating betel leaf. Chewing betel leaf is allowed. Is he your partner? I don't know him. I don't know her personally. I saw her performing at the dance She was singing. I swear... I swear I haven't done anything. I came with the wedding procession from Rawalpindi. And my father... Father own a reputed hotel. Your days of spying are over... my friend. Every dog has his day. What is Blue Bird? How dare you ask me questions? Have you captured me? There's going to be a big blast in Delhi tomorrow. Unfortunately you won't be there to see it. Won't you fulfill my last wish, Colonel? You want a chopper to get out of here? I want a chilled beer. I am sure you can arrange for it. Get him a beer. But don't give him the bottle. Bring it in a paper cup. He's very cunning. Anything else. Juice for you? Thank you. Will you marry me? Where to now? Delhi. We're in Karachi? We need to reach Jahangir point in ten minutes. Welcome. The pilot says we'll leave at dawn. You'll be in Delhi in two hours. All the arrangements have been done. You will have to fly really low... ...for the Geiger counter to detect any radiation. But what is wrong? Tell me. Sorry, sir. I cannot tell you anything. Mr. Nawaz is going to brief you. Please come. Come, sir. You cannot make baseless allegations against Pakistan. Do you have evidence? Colonel Huzefa mentioned 'Blue Bird'. What is 'Blue Bird'? Colonel Huzefa died in Karachi yesterday. So how can you say that he's involved? I saw him giving orders myself. Tehmur Pasha was present there as well. They spoke about the bomb You shut up. You're betraying your country, and accusing others. The meeting is over. - No, it's not over. If this bomb explodes in Delhi, there'll be nuclear war. We will launch a counter attack. In 20 minutes, Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad will be annihilated. More than 60 lakh people will die on both sides. If you say Pakistan isn't involved... ...then this is the time to prove it. What is Blue Bird? Name? Place? What is it? Believe me, I don't know. Mr. Khan, I can be court-martialed for bringing you here. But millions can be saved as well. Control room. 10 geo-stationary satellites. And two roaming. There are more than 4000 cameras installed in Delhi. We can see everything. And maybe you can see your wife in one of these cameras... ...who just returned home after dropping your kids to school. There are other mothers, children, families who have no idea... ...that everything will be over in four hours. I believe it, Mr. Khan. That you don't know. But there must be someone in Pakistan, in ISI or in your embassy... ...who knows! Please, find out. "These days he never stops anyone." "No matter what you do, it never interferes." "There's loot and plunder all around, and destruction." "God is up above, and we're on earth." Would you like to have tea? "These days He pays less attention to us." One world government. Look I've never understood this term. We are a small circle of friends. Including top bankers, oil magnets, media personalities... ...political figures, even an ex-president of the United States. Yes. And this group has control over almost the entire world economy. Maybe what you are saying is right. But these immense resources. If they are used properly, then anything is possible. Governments have their own agenda. Their own programs. But at the end of the day... ...it is the individual that matters. Blue Bird is the Lashkar's safe house... ...and Professor Yusuf Malik's house. Ashiana Bungalow. Khilji road. Behind Qutub complex. We cannot raid that place, sir. What if they press the trigger? - We don't have an option. There's one way. Professor Malik. - Yes. I am Iram. Iram Parveen Bilal. I want to meet the Colonel. Who? You've got the wrong address. Iram. Last year, London bombings. Is the Colonel here or not? Come in. The Colonel didn't mention anything about you. Where is he? He's gone to the bus stop. Will be back soon. How far? - He'll be back. Will you have tea? Yes, thank you. What is that? Locate HOHO bus 6DL 3323. Sir, that bus is at Humayun tomb. Next stop is Red Fort. Stay at Red Fort, one hour. - Built in 1638. Come, ma'am, take care of your belongings. I am heading towards the bus. Are you ok? Sit down. I am fine, thank you. I will get biscuits. She's working for the cops, Professor. Kill her. And don't disconnect the phone. Let it be, I'll do it. - No. "I just spoke to the Colonel, you traitor" Move in. Move in. Are you okay? He just called the Colonel. Triangulate this number. Triangulating 9810160605. Sir, this number has been switched off. Near Pari Chowk, Noida. I am sending a chopper. Jimmy, ...get out of the bus. And find your own way to the target. No, don't touch the timer until I say so. "Since Bisleri got popular." "Everyone forgot about wells and handpumps." "Since Bisleri got popular." "Everyone forgot about wells and handpumps." "Even though farmers produced food-grains." "They had to commit suicide." Where to, sir? - Janpath. That will be Rs. 200. Let's go. What's in the bag? - Nothing. Can I see? The call's been triangulated in Noida. Cell tower 26 D. Come on, move. How far is Noida? - Five minutes. Move. Move. Move. Move. Hello, sir. Yes, I've left the bus. Take us to Kinari Bazaar. Kinari Bazaar. I'm heading straight. Please get down. We've sat down now. Let's go. It's a smart dress. But it makes me look fat. I am going to wear a sari. I look smart in a sari... I think this guy is taking us for a ride. Where are you going? Turn around. Take a U-turn. Can't you hear? Are you deaf? Get down at the signal. - Why should we get down? I'll make the inspector teach you a lesson. Look, sir. He's really... Get down. What's wrong? Why are you screaming? What is wrong? He has the bomb. Don't give him a chance to press the trigger. Shoot only if you get a headshot. Only if you get a headshot. Not receiving Cam 56 from Barakhambha. Cam 3 zoom in. Stay. And there are passengers. - He's taken the ITO flyover. He's entered the one way from the opposite side. Why aren't you listening? Oh, God! We are checking the area around the cell tower, sir. The mobile phone is switched off. Frankly he can be anywhere. Sir Metla is here for a charity program. Lovely to meet you. Yes, certainly. Dr. Ruby. - Sir Metla. What are you doing here? You are here for a charity function. I don't do charity. I do investments. We're getting late. Good, sir. Good. Nice seeing you. Move it. Clear the traffic. Move them. They found a dead cabbie near the cell tower... ...there's definitely a connection. Call the dog squad. Move. Move. Move. I lost him. Iram, come in. Iram, come in. Iram, come in. Thank you for your hospitality. Is there a scheduled time for the helicopter to leave? We should go now. It's really getting late now. There was a technical problem, sir. It's been solved. But we should leave immediately. Okay, let's go. I will think about it. The pilot is the Colonel. Get in. Get in. Stop. My glasses. I need my glasses. Please, my glasses. Rascal. Colonel, I am in an ice-cream parlor at Connaught Place. Nirula's. Only nine minutes left. Happy birthday to you. Everybody out. Get out, come on. Everybody out. Everybody out. Go, go, go. Everybody out. Everybody out. Darn it. Sir. I have found the bomb. It's demanding a password. Run, run. Vacate the place. Hurry up. Come on, come on, come on everybody. The firing circuit has completely failed. I will have to open it completely. Open it. - That will take time. At least 15-20 minutes. Get out. Ground all choppers, sir. Only four minutes left. Waiting for coordinates. Get me the map for outer Delhi. Fly north by north east, Radial 045. Fly high for the first two minutes. Then at 500 feet for the last minute. Setting course, north by north east. Radial 045. You'll see an old copper mine. The mine is 2000 feet deep Crash the bomb in the mine. - Roger that, sir. It was a privilege serving with you, my boy. Jai Hind, sir. Requesting personal time. Connect me to Iram, sir. She is in no stage to be moved. She's losing too much blood. Iram. Iram. Iram, it's Vinod. Iram. - Is everything okay? Under control. Are you fine? - I am not going to make it, Vinod. What happened? That bastard shot me. - Where are you hit? How bad is it? - Two bullets on the liver. I've lost lot of blood. Can you come here? Please. Can you come here? I am in the helicopter, with the bomb. Trying to take it as far away from the city as possible. Why... Why can't we diffuse the bomb? Lt's asking for the password, which I don't have. Listen to me, Iram. I had decided... ...that I would try and give you the life you wanted. I just want you to know that I had decided that. If there is something on the other side... Then we'll meet soon. Just one minute left. Say something terrific. Stay with me. She's bleeding. Iram. Press it. Press it. Password. Kazan set it in Morocco. Kazan? Do you know the password? Do you know his mother's name? He killed her himself. - What? Who? - Zilleh. Zilleh? Zilleh. Zilleh. Who's Zilleh? Iram. Iram. His pet camel Her name was Zilleh. Spell it. Can you spell it? Z I L L... Iram. - E H. We did it. We made it, baby. Complete the formalities. We will fly her body to Pakistan You wanted a world... ...where this Rubaiyat is just a book of poems. Maybe you are in such a world now. We found this on the Colonel's body. Possibly his insurance policy. Check it. We cannot touch this man. He's beyond our reach. And its impossible to prove anything in court. If anything happens to him. An accident or... Cheers. In the last 48 hours Pakistan's army has raided... ...training camps and many sleeper cells of Lashkar. And more than 200 operatives have been killed... ...and around 600 have been arrested. These raids have... ...served a harsh blow to many terrorist organizations like Lashkar. Sayyad, don't ask who I am. Just listen carefully. I know who's behind the incident that took place in Delhi. Freddie Khambatta. - Agent Vinod, sir. I would like to show you something. Am I making myself clear? - Yes. Lashkar is the most active group these days. Yes. The Zeus group doesn't want any publicity. No comebacks. I will cover my footsteps. But what's the guarantee that you will spare me... ...after the job's done? There'll be 25 million Euros in your bank. You take care of that. And let us take care of the world. Cheers. - Cheers. What is this? Why are you showing this to me? My granddaughter shows me such videos on Youtube. Smart idea. You would've exploded the bomb in Delhi. And the world would've thought... ...that a group like Lashkar is behind it. So Colonel used people like Abu, Kazan, Jimmy and Huzefa. Put the stamp of Jehad on the operation. You wanted to trigger a war between both countries... ...and make millions. Fascinating theory, Agent Vinod. But why did you get this here? Take it to the press. It'll be fun for a few days. But now you must excuse me. I need to... attend a function. The Zeus group. Great businessmen like you. Senators, ex-prime ministers. I've heard that whenever you meet... ...something strange occurs somewhere in the world. Some President's death in a plane crash. A civil war in a small country. Nuclear blast in New Delhi. Wow. Wow, Agent Vinod. Wow. You think you know everything. But I want to add to your knowledge. A bomb blasts in Delhi. But the real explosion happens in the stock exchanges of New York... ...London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing You would short stocks and make your billions. But what about the millions that die in both the countries? What about them? You know what would've happened to China... ...if the stock market had crashed? How NATO would've seized Pakistan's nuclear bombs? And we could have solved the Iran pipeline situation These are complex issues. You are a police officer. It's beyond your understanding. You will have to die. Sir Metla. Today. You're here to kill me. I won't kill you, sir. You're a hero in my country. And you'll die as a hero. There'll be roads built in your name. Stamps issued. Books written about you... Goodbye, sir. Sir Metla will be back soon. Won't you sit down, sir? Coffee, please. What's he doing? Second cup of coffee, sir. Sir Metla. Sayeed Kousar has sent his regards. Who? - Lashkar, sir. Bismillah. Our news desk has confirmed that sir Jagdeshwar Metla has... ...been assassinated in what appears... ...to be a suicide bombing in central London. Sir Metla was on his way to a felicitation... ...by the Indo British chamber of commerce. Initial reports state that Sir Metla had been... ...seen talking to a south Asian man seconds before the explosion. It appears that Sir Metla was killed by the same terror group... ...that planned a nuclear attack in New Delhi. It was Sir Metla's heroic intervention that... ...thwarted the well laid plan. Our correspondent Marge Atkins is at the site. Tell us what is happening Marge... I know you. You are Freddie Khambatta. I don't like that name. So what is your name? "The bungalow's locked." "How do I get in?" "Laila's window is open." "There's a gutter below it." "Someone's at the window." "Laila's having an affair." "She has a blast at the expense of my love." "My darling, after I am smitten by you." "Where are you going blowing away my love?" "My darling, after I am smitten by you." "Where are you going blowing away my love?"

"Where are you going blowing away my love?" "P U N G I..." "I am Laila, I will blow your love away." "P U N G I..." "I am Laila, I will blow your love away." "After making those false promises in English." "Where are you going blowing away my love?" "My darling, after I am smitten by you." "Where are you going blowing away my love?" "My darling, after I am smitten by you." "Where are you going blowing away my love?"
