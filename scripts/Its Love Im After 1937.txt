What, and that fixes everything? What am I? A fish? My master tells you want to eat kipper. Like to fish? Treats it as a rotten fish. Eggs? Would not be right? They come from aristocratic chickens. Darling, if you want a kipper Basil, probably not want eggs even aristocratic. I guess with eggs will have to suffice. Eggs and a bottle of whiskey. - At breakfast? - And another for lunch. No kippers, ha. And no autographs on Sundays. Have you ever heard this? What a shame! Good work! You should be ashamed. Thank you, friend. I told him a thing or two. I think it's wonderful.

We prepare your kipper. Meanwhile, I offer. I forgot to present last night. This is my prom ... A friend Henry Grant. How are you? My aunt Paisley. - That hand! That hand! - What's wrong with your hand? Look how heart line. He will marry once. May God watch over his wife. The lucky! Mr. Underwood has time for that. Oh, Mr. Underwood, We're soul mates! I met Sir Henry Irving, a great actor. Well, it's your opinion. Come. May I present Mrs. Kane. My friends say "Blossom". How sweet! I know him well: Wearing boxer shorts with blue polka dots! Is there reformatory in California? This is Mr. Babson. Nice to meet you, boy. You can call me "Chico". The Babson lady. I recognize the hand. And Mr. Hinkle, Hinkle Utilities, and Mr. Kane, Kane Chemicals. Ah, captains of industry! Where is my kipper? Ah, here you are! I was thinking about what you said on my acting conditions. You call this kipper smoked? Test. What's this? Who brought it? Quemado, and so all the meat. What crap is this? Where is the rascal cook? How dare, villains, you get this from and serve wardrobe who does not appreciate? Take him everything! With knives, mugs and everything! Petruchio! The Taming of the Shrew! - I tell to you, Kate ... - My name is Ella. That is burned ... and dry. And I can not even touch it ... Begets anger ... well, Rooted anger! Because of his nature we have fact likely to anger ... better still feed more dried meat. It seems he did not like. And I thought that since had seen it all! I'm stunned. Interpretation insurmountable, sir. And we leads directly back to Miss Joyce. What a lack of education! I'm sorry that happens, my dear, But what did you expect? I get sick! Price and pruritus! What right do they criticize? What are manners? Rules small for small people ... It's too big for that. Genius is above such trivialities. I will apologize on behalf of all. Marcia, wait! Oh, sorry the attitude of our guests! No problem, dear. We're used to it. Are you fond of horses? As a child, I liked the carousel. I ride on Sunday. I'd love to come. Would you? Yes. What's that? What? That little thing on your cheek. Oh! That is a beauty mark. None of that. Is it a mole! A wart certainly, sir. Here is another one! Right. If she has two, she must have a third. - I have another! - Where? It is not your business. What do you want from my daughter, Mr. Underwood? Leave him alone, Dad. Please! Nobody has my minor consideration. I can not bear to Women with warts. Enter the convent! Gone! Ah! Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1a. How can you say that? It's a beast! I hate you! I hate you! Last act last scene! Go players we are, sir! Henry, I congratulate their future commitment. Quick but effective. I can never thank enough. No, no, it is I who have be thankful ... For allowing me to recover ... my dignity. Oh, please, don't mention it! And now, sir? Pack your bags. For this relief, thank you very much. Hamlet, Act I, Scene 1a. My sweet ... Now you see it as it is. But he's right. How? These warts are horrible! I had not noticed ... Not true. I love them! You know what beauty! He is an expert ... I'm going to get. What do you mean? Cut them?? Well, I do not know the other, but ... These two have to go! All for what that fool says? He's not dumb, I'm the one behaved like a child. It is frank, and I admire him. Do you admire? ... Listen to me: If you love me, or touches. Sorry, but you are not engaged to my warts. And I'm going to remove. Come on, Digges, Miss Joyce will be proud of us. I hope with all my heart, sir. Today there will be a wedding at noon. Oh, nothing like a wedding at noon! Hey, Lord Actor! Be something you ignore. She knows something we ignore. It may not be as important if ignored. Where are you going? To a desert island with little children. You'll never know what she going to do? It will get rid of your moles. At least two. He's crazy about you! And Henry is that doctrine. Come, sir, remember the wedding. I have caused the effect "Bash me-to-me-love" ... I do not know that you will be given you, but it works! Wait! I have to talk! Sorry, man, I gotta go! Cracks, huh? "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but the words do not touch me. " He's right, Digges. What do you say? Not here. Top. With his hand on the lock. If you do, stick a pin. Use a glove, Digges. If I were not a gentleman, behave like a lout. What is Babson's room? Second lock on the left. I made a small tactical error. Error. Come on, before it gets worse. What do we do? I have not exhausted my repertoire. Think of something more drastic. Think of something that works. - It's noon and you said ... - Undo bags. Should I return without purge my fault? I'm willing to give 300 points for trying, sir. I refuse to cheat. The bags! Henry, trust me. I do it for their happiness ... and my salvation. I hope you are sincere. Go kindness on your part! How I adore the girl! And how we love Mrs. Joyce, sir! And me too! - Or not? - Sure, sir! I wonder: is Marcia so young and innocent ... Higher? Excites my feelings become that she thinks I'm ...? I would say its more exciting low feelings, sir. I apologize, I'm sorry, sir. What if I reformed by wrong woman? Pasadena?? Who is this? Miss Joyce, I am very worried. I have a head full of small creatures green jumping from here to there. And you are the one is concerned? Come and find your man if you really love him. Yes, I realize. Mr. Basil is sorry about yesterday. Miss Joyce, there to help him. Tucked in awful mess! That stew in its own sauce! Things to try your own poison! Has he said that? Are you sure you love me? He said that? Any other friendly thing? Really? What kind of mess is the boy? How he can not speak? Are you back in prison? Oh, a home phone. What do I do? Let me think. Remember the trick use in Detroit? It will now be useful. What is this mystery? I learned one thing. What? I'm not sure. I think Marcia is falling in love with the actor. Mr. West, You are brilliant. Where was all this time? Foul come out in the headlines! He invited all the neighbors to display it! Everyone knows that ... Nobody ever tells me anything! Sorry, Marcia. I want to talk with Mr. Underwood. Right. See you next to flowers. I thought his intentions and seem very suspicious. Make no mistake. Our friend to me too perplexes me. - Ours? - Well, yours. She will not leave deceived by an actor. I decided to reason and speak as a father. - What kind of father? - Desperate. - What will you talk? - For you. - I will praise his qualities. - And in the meantime? His Cyrano owners! In that case, I give him a punch in the nose. I'm coming! Trust me. It is very important to me too. - Does it seem sensible to be alone? - I just want to talk. I know. As a father. He's been starting as father and end up as something else ... Hopefully, sir. Parental speech It may not be necessary. Why not? Anything can happen. What are you talking about? Could something emerge, sir! I've thought it. It is decided. - I'm with you. - No. It's not a family reunion. I could watch them. If you stay more relaxed, do it. Thank you, sir. Monitors, but with discretion. Consider a signal. One of my birds? If I step on the line, whistle! Do you prefer the lark or the nightingale? I leave it to your expert judgment. That reassures me. You are restless for nothing. - They are beautiful. - Awesome. The color of her cheeks. I'll put in my bouquet dress. And they live happily. You want me to marry Henry? Of course! Good old Henry. I do not want! He's a good boy, your way. It is so stiff and boring. When it is a little more great, dear ... will appreciate a strong person ... on which to rely. But I'm young, I want joy, live a little. Say what? I said "phew". I thought I heard the whistle of a bird. It's not weird! Come with me. No surprises! Nothing! I love birds. Nice. I wonder what they think now. I like lovebirds. Do you like? I like everything it's romantic. The actors are romantic. If they were not would not actors. Tell me about yourself. Come. Sit.

Romances dying first light. You are a loner. I perceive ... What an observer! Yes, I'm a loner. In the depths of my being, I am. I look forward to mourn! Very friendly. You need to someone to love him. Who cares ... Take me with you! I can not. I told him I did not know who he wanted. Now I know. You! Are you sure? Or is it a passing fad? Take my hands. Feel my heart. Love? Youth? It is as real as everything you've ever known. And two days or two lives, do not change anything. Oh, dear! - Impossible, you're a girl. - I am 20 years old. - Not more than a chemical reaction. - No! It turns hormones! I love you! I do not know. As I know you. I love! It is false! I can not love more than one year, a month, a week! But what a week what month, what year! What a mess! Something is wrong, Digges? I wonder why love It is so wonderful ... This is no time for riddles ... Do not be shy, dear. There it is! Follow! Joyce! What a pleasant surprise! I'm no surprise. - A good day, right? - Very nice. Beautiful light! Nice place, right? Yes! Just for murder. You are not Joyce Arden? Yes, and you young of the car of last night. Is not that right, Basil? I think so. How will your research, dear? What right does she so to speak? Virtually none. Today, almost Wives have no rights. His wife? My wife. Wonderful! Are you married? Ah, yes, I'm married. This is my faithful little wife. Nice to meet you, Miss West. Did not he have said, my poor child? Do not touch me! It is wonderful! My wife! I take out of a terrible mess! How could you think that ...? No, Joyce. You deserve an explanation. Yesterday afternoon I came to Henry Grant me. Do you remember the man yesterday? It was Henry! Your father and I We're great friends. Come, love, sit. Henry is engaged to a young man. He's crazy about her, and she is madly in love with me. You know how it is cured. Sit. I was begged to come to take away their illusions. A gentleman could not refuse. And what do I find? The girl in the dressing room! Is not it funny? That's what I was doing. Make it "out of love" me. I think I'll scream. Please, no guests. Sure I'm going to scream! Control yourself. Remember your heartburn. Do not worry. I do it for a friend, by you. Anyway, would not understand. I'm going. Goodbye. You are to blame for everything! Silence! - My cab is gone? Where is? - Let me explain. I insist. Where is my cab? I fired him. Stay please. Another call. What do I do? Follow it. Do not lose sight. If I did not contain, I ... Silence! Wait a minute! I forgive you. Knew before me. What happened, I walked. - Have you no shame? - Not if you love me! I do not love, it was platonic! Not with that kiss. Me you will not deceive. I hate to mention it, but I'm married. Very kind to your woman, but ... I have to go. Talk to you later. Have not seen a woman crazy here? - What, sir? - The woman who ... Ah, Mrs. Underwood! It is in the room that you Do you try to escape from me? My little girl, I ... You can not kiss me like that and get away! Open! Yesterday as I closed the door. It is true. I'm going as the taxi arrives. Joyce, if I open it, kill me! Well! Let there be blood and destruction! Opens or I do now! You should call your agent Press ... and photographers! You will not do something secret! For? Last time, are you open? Agree! I'll get my gun. Eye. The trigger is the back. Okay, remember this time, woman! Die with your name on my lips. Goodbye, Joyce. Listen, let's be sensible. Hogwash! Neither can kill you! Honey, you gotta believe me! I do this for you! I already pictured The Love Triangle. It is exactly that! Your alibis are getting worse! Do I have to do or unpack? Neither. Bring Mr. Grant. I will ask you for forgiveness on your knees! Who insulted who? It is a monstrous being. None of that. - Basil Underwood! A monster! Oh, I give up! Did you do come to his wife? - The woman whom? - De Basil. - Are you married? - No woman would have if not. Mr. Underwood wants see you right away. What do you want to see? Let me, Dad. I've suffered enough. You prove that you are being unfair. Henry, come here. There is a small problem to fix. My wife is a suspicious person. This is the Lord Grant. How are you? Is not it true that came to me last night, in order to dissuade his girlfriend no love for me? Prepare to blush. - Not a word is true. - That's what I wanted to know! - You're a liar! - I'm no liar. There is another reason. I dared not speak in the garden but really what did it for you. What garden was for me? That was a temporary detour. I came here to improve ... by you. Funny! First Henry, then by me. Who is next, Basil? Love, I beg you to help me! - I'll help. - Will you? It's one of those times I love to help you! That laugh I do not like! Go coward he was! What did you expect? He had to keep the secret. So honor a friendship? I'll admit that I helps to keep my girl! - The bags, Digges. - Are you sure? Right now! What will you do? We return home, Digges. We postpone reform until further notice. So you'll see that Joyce Girl I do not care. - But she's even more in love! - That's your funeral. You do not know like me. Able to follow! Do the ... Goodbye! Sorry sorrow we may cause you, but beyond our control. We suddenly assaulted. We could not help it. I understand. "Love is like leaves in the wind." I'm glad you understand. Are you in love with him, dear? I think it's wonderful. It's so different from the others! I have no words to describe it! Maybe they exist, but require more vocabulary ... Call a taxi, please. It must be very painful. You love it too. My feelings for him They are indescribable, but it is stronger than my love, I wish Happy to see that boy. What are you two talking about? Have a wonderful wife! I can not wait tell everyone! Tell them what? - What were you talking? - For you. From me, what? You and love ... Why the smile Berkshire kitten? - Cheshire, dear. - For Cheshire. - And what of "gata" I did not like. - I said "cat". As the kittens become cats. What matter. What is that smile so mellow? A I'm happy for you. It's a wonderful girl, and adores ... They live an ecstasy of happiness. What do you mean? When I tell you, you are you shaking with laughter. Tell me. Make me shake. It is basically that I grant you a divorce. So we're not married. - See? I said I would help. - Joyce! I beg on your knees! I love it when you kneel. Please stop, stay! Listen carefully, because they are certainly my last words. Since I can remember you're strutting ... regardless of the damage it causes. It's always spring in your heart ... so if you pick some flowers in passing What's wrong with that? Huh? And ultimately, always Joyce was the little ... Joyce small and helpful, to rescue at the last minute. The small and gullible Joyce tall tales that thought. The little jealous Joyce to which you could torment. The small and temperamental Joyce with which you could fight. Small and faithful Joyce whose lap can always go back. Joyce, you're being unfair ... Today you pick up your last flower. And I'm sure that the conserves forever. Want to tell you Today your life over? Love for breakfast, love lunch, dinner and love. Worship sweet syrup. So you will live until you make me want to scream. You will wait in vain a good fight. You will try to flee, but she will not leave. It's just what you deserve, Lecherous bastard! Have you no pity? Save me! Oh, Mr. West! Just I was looking for. Who, me? Do not show me your garden? And that cute birdhouse? With pleasure. Why is it that you men business attracted me so much? Be that they are so different actors ... You already know the gardens, right? Would not it be funny to come back like your mother? Unpack. We're in one mess. If I had heard ... No matter, sir. Now we will, like many other times. Not in a mess like this ... It's a real mess. Thoroughly met our obligations to Mr. Henry! Do not think of him. Neither eternal salvation my soul. It goes much further. You know the life that awaits me with this naive? What sir? Love for breakfast! Love in lunches! Love for dinner! Oh, horrible, sir! I have to get rid of it as, or Ms. Joyce lost forever and that could not stand it. I understand, sir. This girl has us crazy! - Think, Digges, think! - My mind is a barren field, sir. Deplete the possibilities the Love Triangle ... Something must have! - There, Digges! - What, sir? "Alone in the City." He quips! - "Alone in the City," Digges. - But you can not ...! I must! Last resort desperate. She is so young, sir, so innocent! Right. It will flee ... terrified. This will work, Digges. Pack your bags. No! Ah, beautiful doll! What are you doing? Do not be afraid, little one. I'm not afraid. Only I want to know what you do. Some call: "A fate worse than death. " Oh, wonderful! Oh, my love! I knew you loved me. I think I chose a wrong work! Where is the key? Let me out! Mom! This weekend is better than that in which Mr. Morley killed his wife! But what about, honey? They hug and kiss and ... That man and your girlfriend! Do not go! Where is your sense of humor? Do not run away! What happened here? No, Henry, you do not lay well. Pure nobility. I saw with my eyes. You call that nobility? I was weak, and he strong. It is useless, Henry. Has shown me love. I can not marry you. Dinner is served. Joyce! I have talk to you. Still trying "Des-seduce", Basil? It gives me a result. I want to talk with you. Come. Clear! If these days I talk to everyone ... although practically nobody talks to me. Oh, please, Miss Joyce ...! Well ... what do you want? Young ... what intentions is my daughter? - Absolutely no. - All the better to take them! You can not compromise my daughter and turn a blind eye! I assure anyone the commitment! Is it me want to commit to me! Go, Dad. I must talk to him. - As I speak to you Marcia. - This is important! Important?, And this is not? We will. Where are we going to stop? Nothing matters in this world. I know what's plotting, Underwood! Well, you know more than me. Try to steal my girlfriend. Henry, I swear on my honor I have done my best to return it. Well I think I deliberately betrayed! If I'm the type of pig you think I am, I damned right here! He's had his number. I act now! Oh God, the end did! - What is it? - I hit him. That terrible! Yeah, do not like being knocked out. Miss Paysley, we go to dinner. Are you hurt, sir? Digges, can you stop with the sounds of birds ...? - Been reading bad novels. - Do not you tell? The truth! You did not act to destroy their illusions? I knew it! Now it's your turn. The suitcases are ready, sir. Come on, Digges. A good idea sleep at home. Before leaving, I made sure of our devotion. He said he will not return. But he had a sad look. - Yes? - Definitely, sir. I have only one little hope. Are not you Basil Underwood? I took my wife to see Hamlet. I do not know what to do with it. It's a shame! You not at fault! Are the shims! Oh, gosh. Would you could ask a favor? Do not come to my house ...? Help me heal. Disgusting What a guy! Here we are. And where are we? Just you and me together, forever. I will do my best can, sir. I do not know what I'd do without you, Digges ... It is very good to me, sir. No, exaggerate, Digges. No, I'm the one that sometimes not lived up to, sir. I'm surprised. Digges, is here! Do not greet me. Goodbye! Followed me! I knew it! What girl hard head! Do you want to commit? - Return home. - This is my house. Please! What will they think their father and poor Henry? It's there, sir! - Who? - Mr. Henry. - I have left. - Tell him we've gone. He says if you do not go, will enter it. Oh yeah? You are the gift, Digges. Throw it out the window or the fire escape ... and unpacking. If she's here, I fall lightning! I know it is there. Are you saying I'm lying? Not suggesting anything. It is a fact. But it is not why I came. Ah, no? Well, I'm glad to see it, boy! Underwood, a man must know when to give up. Yes, I'm also coming to the bitter conclusion. So I came to wish Maybe both. Oh, Henry ... I hope to be misunderstanding ... It's yours, I give. Oh, please, Henry! I do not want it! - But she loves it! - That's impossible! Hey ... I did it as a favor. I thought it was an attitude decent for me. You can not foist the creature. I forbid you to talk and Marcia! - I thought you loved her! - And so it is. - Well, take it with you, Henry! - No, I love her too! I just want happiness. I will not marry her if he loves you I could not bear her sad eyes ... Hey! Stop play my role! I'm the hero sacrificed here! Do you really love me so much? Clear! - Clear! - You shut up! Who asked him to goal in our stuff? He's right! Well I love it! You ..! Do not mess with Henry! You can rest easy in two weeks and I have forgotten! I loved Clark Gable and am already cured! With it you will like it! Who is Clark Gable? Do not know who Clark Gable! I'm sick of all this. I did a favor for Henry. I know why you did what you did. I studied psychology. You are an exhibitionist. All actors are exhibitionists. You're just an actor! - Just an actor! - And not very good! We all are. Henry has played a big scene. Shakespeare again! A genius, that some truths said. And nothing more true "The world ... "It's a stage, "Men and women, actors, "Everyone does their tickets and exit ... "And various roles in his life. "Acts, seven ages. "First, the creature, hiccuping and throwing up in the arms of his mistress. "Then the boy plaintively, "That, reluctantly, with portfolio morning and radiant face, "Which snail creeps to school. "Then the lover, sighing as an oven; "And composing ballads mourners the brow of his beloved. "And the soldier, with feline whiskers "Astonishing and oaths "Jealous of his honor, vehement fighter "Seeking the bubble reputation until the muzzle. "And the judge, who, with his round tummy full of capons, "Serious eyes and trimmed beard, "Wise aphorisms and quotes well known; "Make your paper. "The sixth age brings "Emaciated old slippers, "Glasses in napias and bag on the side "Shims with youth well guarded, "Anchsimas to as bony stringers; "And his big manly voice, resumes childish ... " By God! What annoying! "The final scene "So unique and varied history "It is the second childhood and total oblivion "Sans teeth, sans eyes, "Tasteless, "Nothing." What, no one? Magnificent interpretation, sir! Thanks, Digges. Check please. I'm going. I'm so sorry, Miss Arden. This will not be the same without you. Can you forgive me? You're the one that I have to forgive. Back to earth boys: ground floor. You two ... Indeed. You can take possession of her husband, Mrs. Underwood. But of all the impertinent vain ... No, no, dear, remember that did all that to turn to collect. No, Henry! Everything you told me ... What ... their efforts to reform, and all that, is a colossal stupidity. Do not ever want to hear that name anymore. You're very sweet, Ms. Underwood, and believe me, You have my sympathy. You know, Digges? I was a very happy man ... before becoming a character in the process of moral reform. But I'm happy to know that is all a man, sir. You are on the column Have the Big Book. That's no consolation. Yes, sir. But before starting this moral reform you had a little odor. Now, it smells as sweet as the lilies of the field. And who wants to smell me? Yes, it's very true, sir. My friend, Miss Joyce and I We have had many differences. But through it all, we were happy. Do you realize that this silly issue lost me the only woman without which I can not live. Do not move! I want to look. What is love? Have something different. I do not know what it is, but you look like a new man. - See? - Yes I thought he was inside. It may be the lighting, but I seem to see as a halo around your head. I did everything for you. Sweetie! The bags, Digges. - What, sir? - Pack your bags. Another time, sir? We flew to Las Vegas. There will be wedding. But needless wedding clothes! The bags! It may not feel like it. Do nothing, Digges! You do not mess! A pack! - Maybe he's tired. - Me too. Everyone has a limit. Too bad that you forget sometimes. What a way to talk! - Do not fret! - I do not get irritated! Washington Does not freed the slaves? What has that to do? I give orders because I pay a salary! Yes! A paltry figure! Again the money old mercenary! On the contrary, I'm a generous soul! Now the Cobras double, Digges. Digges, I recess half! Oh! Being stingy and despicable! What did you say? This is life, Digges! I do not know what to say, sir.
