I'm training. - They lettin' you train? Anybody you get is everybody what you attract, Alex. That what it says in your "how to live your life" books, is it? - Them thick, racist ones be half his family. - How they lettin' him train? When you want proper trainin', yeah, after all the shit he tells you, - come, yeah? - Letch. I'm the standard. Shit standard.

I said it's gonna take us longer than that. They tell me, I tell you. They pressure me, I pressure you. That's what makes the world go round. Then you need to go back and tell them it's gonna take us longer than that. All right? Some fucker's ripped the shit out of this one. Get on with it! You know what? What? What? What, are you blind? You're blind, innit? What you been doin' all mornin'? You can't see the workload we've already got? You pissed around all mornin' again. What do you mean pissin' around? Have you even had a look?

Here we go. - No, but he is lookin' Marga, Jax. - Here we go. You feed him... From he's your god-pickney. You need to do your duties and save me some shekels. How one youth can go through so much bread, ask me. - He's got growing to do. - Yes, I have. You don't need to join in with her foolishness. Go and wash your dirty hands, son. And not over the sink things. Earlier is better, you know? If you're gonna do it. Aaah. Aaah. How's work? Shit. Thought you'd be back earlier. Don't have to do the overtime. Gets me outta the house, innit? Missin' you at the table though. Didn't think you'd be missin' much, Jax. Claim we're loving this hip-hop Are we ready to understand it In its fullest cultural sense? Beyond this useless branding beyond the stories that keep feeding us, the common myth People started rapping in the '70s what a bunch of... Done with the talk loving New York for impact on my heart But let's not pretend that there was no foundation to this art Because... New York pumping 100 watts before the watts prophets, last poets and Gil Scott Before there was jazz before there was blues Before there was cab Calloway Before the whips and ships and all the tragedy You sleepin'? You asleep? Mark? I'm asleep. Asleep, asleep? Asleep. What you sayin'? You making me look at your back. Again. How does it feel? It's been so long since you last let me near. Dad, where's the remote? Don't know. Mum, where's the remote? Ask your dad. Come and go with me let's take a long walk around the park after dark find a spot for us to spark Gonna get crumbs. He's weakening. I ain't you. This is the good bit. Missed the good bit, mark. I've seen it. I seen it. Dad. Change the looping of the breaks over Though corporate, there's nothing pretty about this make Don't be crumbing up the bed. I ain't you. Here's the good bit. What? Come here. - All right, watch. - Don't fight over the food. - That's right. - Get in, get in! I'm not the one to sit back and just let them run me round like that, no way. - Don't keep adding hours. - People take liberties all the time. I told him, "man, they can't do that." You all right though? His mouth's too big, dad. You looking after you? Gotta speak up. Not as much as you do, you don't. You need to look out for you, 'cause them high-up people, them, they lookin' after themself, same way. He's hungry. Not that hungry, mum. That's just hoggish behaviors. Finish your firsts, Jj. So how come Jax can't cook like this? Why are you makin' trouble for? - Mum taught me all I need to know, yeah? - Mmm. Look like she was holdin' something back. Jj, back me up, son. Lose-lose either way, boy. Don't try it. Hey, and I see that. Tastes sweeter from your dad's plate, innit? - Yes, people. - Did you lose your keys? Hi, auntie Sandra. You all right, Jerome? Mum, sit down. You only just sat down. You leave anythin' for me? How's school, little man? - Mark, you cool? - Mmm, blessed still. Life all right with you? Can't complain. Well, I could. You could. Still got the habit. Not as will-powered as you, sis. Not by the food, Sandra. How's reception? - Great. How's welfare? - I wouldn't know. I'm not on it. - Neither am I. - Anymore. - What is it you doin' now? - Jackie. Don't you have no receptionists where you work? Or are you too high ups to know what they do? Sandra. Ain't it depressin' doin' what you do? Deciding who gets a little piece of what, or you lovin' playin' judge and jury, deciding who gets a slice a the state pie? I prefer to pick up phones rather than piss people's lives away. Sandra. But I would. The people all right though. White people, innit? Them young head ones. She enjoyin' it. It's only been a few weeks, mum. That's long, for you. Almost a career. Hmm. Kids. - They're all right. Drink up. - Dangerous. Who'd have 'em? Why do you have me? You see what you start now? Do you see what you start? How you gonna finish that? Well... Did you ask me, Jj? Not at the table. This conversation is not at the table! Everything's wrong about him. He's all right. Mum. Look how he's treated her. I'm not having it. Mum, it's got nothing to do with you. I'm not having a daughter of mine... Vincent! Being treated like that by the likes of him. Why don't you put it down over here? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look. Grandma's comin'. Grandma's comin'. You're still fallin' for that old trick, man. How can it be any worse? Vincent! Vincent! What? Mum! You're breathing. You look like shit, Jax. Nice. Just tryin' to... Yeah, don't, yeah? 'Cause your "nice" is rubbish. You know you're like a sister to me. Where you goin'? Bernie, what you doin'? Fuck bein' late. Fuck them. Bernie. Them work people's too inna-inna anyway. Oh. Prisoner. Great. You're makin' us late for work. What's... Drive the car, b. Nah, Jax, it's like... It should be me vexed, Jackie. Right. What you tell me for, if you don't wanna talk about it? You should be vexed? Draggin' up my shit for no good reason. No good reason? I was askin' you... Do you even know what you wanna do? I never drag up nothin'... I was askin' you... even if you know what you wanna do? I wasn't draggin' up nothin'. 'Cause otherwise, I'd rather that I never did know. Drive the car. From when you did seem so sure. You said I got time. I still got time. Though now it look like you're stallin'. You should know about leavin' it till the last minute and stallin'. You should know all about that. Don't wanna talk about it, I'll back my shit off, but I know how hard Jj was to come by. Don't. And for you that lost fuckin'... Don't, yeah? Three... four. Before him to get him, I can't not say nothin'. I done tryin' to be nice, all tip-toeing around this shit. It don't make no sense, what you're thinkin' about this one. Start the car. Look, I'm not tryin'... Start the car. And it's for you... i swear to god, Bernie, I'll drive it my fuckin' self. But if you wanna do what you wanna do, I'm with you still. That's for you and with mark and that, but if you're not sure... This make no fuckin' sense. - Unless it's not mark's. - Fuck you. Then what's the problem? Jackie? Fuck you. You never... You fuckin' know me, yeah? Then it no make no fuckin' sense, Jax. Jackie! What? Then either he fucked you when you were sleepin', or you goin' nuts. Start the car. Or you ain't pregnant. Or you lyin'. You don't know nothin'. Then tell me. You don't know nothin'. - Well, then tell me. - You don't know nothing. Then tell me. Fuck, girl, tell me somethin'. Just copy them down, everyone, okay? And then I'll explain afterwards. Careful, Lauryn. Gently. Hold on. Careful. I gotta go home, Jj. Jerome. Jerome. Jj! Jerome, what you got? Nothing. It's sick. What's sick? This some school thing? Let me see. - You'll scare it. - Scare what? - Don't scare it. - Make me see it. It's nothing. Out of the house. Mum. Nah, nah, nah. It's a outside creature, so take it back where it belong. I don't want no sick somethin' all up in my house. You're scaring it. What part of dirty bird belong in here? You'll be broken, boy, if you don't get that... Take it and the box it's dyin' in outta... Lauryn broke it. Out me kitchen. You mad? Move. Boy, done lost the last bit of sense he got given. Hmm? He can stay out there all night, far as I'm concerned. You know what he's like. That half-dead thing ain't coming in here. He's gonna stay out there all night. Good. He's stubborn. He's ignorant. Mmm! He's his mother's child. Nah, he needs to eat somethin'. He needs to eat somethin', and he needs to come in. Jax, man. - Oi! Make sure you wash your hands good. - Not over the kitchen things. That's it. The boy... - leave it. Leave him. Leave it. I'm not havin' him comin' in here... nah, Jax. Mark. Come on. He'll come round. He'll come in. Hmm? I don't want him in. Jackie. Come on. Just let him care for the thing. Let him try. We all did them sort of thing when we was younger. I never did deal with no dead bird in no box. It ain't dead. - How you know? - It ain't dead. You been by it? Nah, Jax. You been by it? Not everyone's like you, you know. He's just trying to care for the thing, that's all. I never did play no vet when I was a youth neither. Mmm. We know what you was playing instead. And it was you I was playing it with. That's right. Now you wanna be nice. I am nice. Treat you like you treat me, innit? Treat you good. You think? Treat you better. Don't think so. He won't. He's cold. No, no. He won't. He's gonna come in. Mark... Jax, man, where you been? What? What? Mmm! You all right? Yeah. On or off, dad? Off. Huh? Off. Keep it calmer. Foxes would have got it. Laws of nature, boy. Clean up when you're done, yeah? So what are you gonna do if it don't get no better? Ich wei nicht. Dad... and you know it's your job to clock in with it... Every few hours, yeah? Dad... Without waking up the whole household, 'cause I ain't running up and down. Dad? Hmm? Do you want it to be a boy or a girl? What, the bird? The baby. You're the type who'd phone up and vote. - I was just sayin'. - You phone in? I was just sayin' I thought the girl in silver did all right. Fuckin' foolishness. You too busy watching documentaries or some other bollocks, that's him. Only you can think that watching shit that ain't your shit is a problem. And I never said I phoned in, so all of you can kiss it, spin on it and piss right off. She leavin' you? What, she dealing with a next man? Fuck off p, man. No, she's not. She ain't a bad mother. No, she's a great mother. Well, you got nothin' to worry about then. Nothing worth worrying about. They can be sometime-ish, you know that. Nah, wait. Wait. - See that? - Yeah. All right? You been... You been through what you've been through. We've been through this before. Yeah, three times before. I know. Four. Four times. Four times before. You understand? Which is why she might not wanna drag your arse through it again, huh? She 'fraid. She nervous. And what? I ain't? Settle down now, please. Okay, class, come on. Start to settle down. I hope you've got your science books open. Pages 12 and 13. "Studying animal cells." Jerome. Jerome! What, sir? Come on, paying attention now, please. - Are there birds in them? - No. No birds. Am I in them? No, not you. - Is dad in them? - No. Are they always the same? Are you scared in them? You know, if you was scared, you could come dream me in them... and do what? Put you in my dreams, be a nightmare. Lucky I ain't scared in 'em, huh? Wish I had dreams like yours. Can't remember mine. So this is where I should look you, right? You shruggin' me, boy? You think you can sit there and give me a shrug off? How's German? Didn't have it. Geography's boring though. Don't care how boring it is. Trust me, you'd be bored. Work's boring. Not as boring as geography. 'Cause you know? You're gettin' good trainin', boy. Sometimes I come here. You got homework? You got homework. Soon come. Where's Jj? Jj's all right. Ain't askin' if he's all right. Asking where he is. Think I wouldn't know where he is? He's by your mum's. You leave somethin' for him? He's eating there. Leave him a little somethin' though. He won't need feeding. You know he likes a little leftovers. He ain't comin' home hungry, Jax. How you know? So what, tonight's all about him? I don't know what tonight's meant to be about, mark. I really ain't into him bein' out without askin'. Your mum's fine with it. I told her that we just... you been chattin' our business? Your mum loves havin' him. You know that. I'm just sayin' that... I know. You know? I know. Night, mum. Come. Nice time, huh? Nana spoil you? Dad gave me the leftovers too. It's late. Sweet dreams, yeah? Can I say good night to the baby? Night. See you soon. It's small. You were small. Look at you now. Go brush your teeth. I know you know. I know you're shittin' yourself. I'm shittin' myself too. But better we be brickin' it together. You got a way with words. Nah. Got a way with you. Which? Jj, which one? I'll do it. Sorry. You still vex with me? Are you? You're too heavy-handed. That's what my mum says. You told your mum? You told yours. Your mum still sick? She ain't sick. She's just pregnant. Told you. She know you know yet? You'll be a good big brother, Jj. My brother's an idiot, but you'll be a good one. Who's doing the doors? You in 'em? Some. Doing what? They all the same? Nah. Yeah. Sort of different, but... Bad dream-sleeping. They're worse. "Than dreams," you said. And I ain't asleep. Hallucinations. Visions. Dream-sleeping. Visions. Told you. You're meant to be reassuring me. Who's reassuring me? It's a bit mad. One minute you couldn't have more, and two-twos you're tellin' me... They thought it would be difficult to have a next youth. They said you couldn't have no more. I was there, remember? Me and mark, both. You never even told me you was tryin'. I weren't trying. Glad you never done what I did though. I'm not. What's mark saying? You know. Excited. Nervous. You know? Making a mess. Do I make it over? Everyone's made a mess. I think I'd want a boy, you know. Hmm. Hmm-hmm. You would be a hard act to follow though, son. Hard act. I mean it. Michael, don't. Why are you defending that for? You nervous? Ain't you nervous? If I was you, I'd be nervous. I'd be shitting myself. Fifth time lucky, innit? Jj's where I got lucky. Luck ain't got nothing to do with this. Mum and dad know, you know. We all know. Ain't saying nothing till you announce. Knowing what's happened before and all. So we're waiting on you. Got us all playing your little game, innit? "Ah, yes, hello. The French guy. Why don't you sit up quietly?" Now, I think that's... Don't fuckin'... don't you fuck... I'm gonna take this... As your hormones goin' mental. Take it how you like. Or your lack of sleep messin' with your mind. Whatever. I'm not gonna stand here and watch you smoke through your bomboclaat mistakes. Mistakes? What is said in the bogs, stays in the bogs. You understand? I didn't... I don't... I didn't hear what you was... At least you made the effort to do shit right when you lost the other ones. Fuck you. Yeah, Bernie? Hear what? A piece of fuckin' cake ain't gonna do it for you this time, Jacqueline. Say it! Say it. Come on. Come on. To my face! Say it! Fuckin' go on. Hmm? Yeah? See? See. Yeah. You ain't even gonna fucking try. You-you ain't gonna try an', like... You ain't gonna d-deny it! You don't... what? You're not gonna just try deny it! 'Cause that's you. Go on. To my face, just try and lie. Lie, innit? Jax! Go on! To my face! I fuckin' dare you! Please. My face. Lie. Try. Yeah. You sit there like you're somethin'. Hmm? Sit there like you're somethin' that someone would want. Who someone would wanna fuckin' set up with and lay down with for the last 20... Sit there like you're something like that! Go on. Because you ain't worth shit, Jacqueline. You ain't worth shit. You ain't nothing. You ain't nothing that nobody would want. Nothing! Who's gonna fucking want you? Who? Who's gonna fucking... You ain't fucking worth that. Look at me. Look at me. You ain't worth this. You're not worth this. Look how long we been together, yeah? And what we fucking went through. This is what you do? This is what you do to me? Me and Jj... this is what you fucking do? She gotta go home. Lauryn... Gotta go. - You said you'd drop her. - I know what I said. Know what, son? Son? Dad. Hear what? See if you can help me out with this one. Mark. See if you can gcse this one. Mark, don't. 'Cause your dad is struggling. Yeah. So, see if you can... Math it out for me. How from, your mother didn't want me to touch her, right? Jerome, go see your... Don't go nowhere, Jerome. Leave him out of this thing, mark. Hey. Help your dad out. Yeah? Mark. Huh? Yeah. Yes. I ain't looking to embarrass you. Yeah, boy? You ain't embarrassed, is you? 'Cause i... I ain't embarrassed. 'Cause come on. We both talked about them things. 'Cause see it... This one? Yeah? First she want it, the next time she don't want it... mark, leave him out of this. So, tell me how the maths don't work out all now? Jj, Jj. Come out the kitchen. Don't go nowhere, 'cause I know it don't take no a levels to know that. I ain't fucking stupid. Like, I can't fucking count. Hmm? What? Jerome. Best you don't say nothing. Jerome, get upstairs. Best you don't say shit. Yeah? 'Cause you see your mum... You know what? Hear what? What do you think of your mum? What do you... What do think she is? I ain't askin' what we thought she is. We know what we thought she is, who we thought she is. I ain't askin' that. Because that don't count for shit, yeah? Twenty years don't count for nothin'. Know that now. Nah. Now, what I wanna know is... Because, you know, your mum thinks we're stupid. Mm-hmm. Thinks we're dumb. So, what I wanna know is, what you think about her? What do you think about her? I know what I think about her. I know what I think. Jerome? Stop, mark. Hmm? What do you think about her, boy? Mark, I ain't gonna tell you again... What ain't you gonna tell me again? Leave him out. What ain't you gonna tell me? What else you got that you ain't gonna tell me? Jacqueline... What ain't you gonna tell me? Just tell me... Somethin'. Tell me somethin'. I beg. Fuckin' tell me somethin'. Leave him out of this madness, mark. Huh? What? I never brought him into it. I never... yeah, you did, from you done it. Okay? Jj... Come and clear the table up. Jj... Clear the table away. Your mum's done with her dinner. Leave it, Jj. Leave it, Jj. Yeah, it's all right. It's all right. I'll do it later. From we finish our food, Jj. Jerome... Clear the table. Clear the table. You finished, mum? Jerome... Lauryn's gotta go home. - I'll take her. - No, you won't. Jj... Jerome... Jerome, go tell her to get her things. Unforgivable. Yeah. You are.

You're gonna be all right, yeah? She gonna be all right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, man. She's gonna be all right. All right? I done the bathroom. What they sayin'? They said anythin' since... None don't change. We just have to wait. - How's the baby? - Fuck the baby. This is about Jax. So, what did you do? - What you do to her? - No, Sandra. Well, last time I see her she was... no, Sandra. Know you was thinking it too, dad. We all wonderin' it. Last time I see her she was cool. She was all right. Not here. We all wonderin' it though. Know you're thinkin' it, mum. Only person who been with her, between us, is you, mark. - Jerome, you know? - Don't. Jerome, what did... Don't talk to my boy. "Your" boy? My nephew. Jerome... i ain't gonna tell you again, you know. Or what? What? You gonna do me like you did her? - I never done her nothin'. - Sandra. She do it 'cause she like that? Don't think so. Because she felt like it? Don't think so, mark. This isn't the time. Not the Jax I know, and I know her longer than you. Somethin' must have driven her to it. Somethin' or someone... and from it weren't us, that leaves you... What? I'm just saying... j, go find somewhere to put some clothes on. I'm just sayin' what everyone here is thinkin'... Everyone who is family is thinkin'. Thank you for bringing the clothes, Sandra, but you can go home now. You can't tell me where to go. Jj, go find somewhere to put on these clothes. Go on. Just find somewhere down there. What did you do to my sister? If I say somethin' to this one, right here... you know what? What did you do... "this one"? It's gonna be somethin' we both regret... leave it now. I suggest you find another... Go on. Go on. What can you suggest? Go on! 'Cause I ain't gonna sit here and slit my wrists, am I?
