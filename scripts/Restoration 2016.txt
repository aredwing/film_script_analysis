They'll be here soon, John. You're doing great. Now let's talk about where you're gonna vacation after this, huh? What's your favorite place? Are you a mountain man? You like to go camping and fishing? Maybe a little cabin with your girlfriend? Because you're doing great. Now where do you wanna go when you get out of here, huh? How about New York City? It's so magical there. The Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Broadway. I'm a water baby myself. Love the ocean. You ever been to the Bahamas? Oh, you'd love it, John. Just love it. Warm sun, the coronas are cold and cheap. Come on, John. Just hold on, okay? Your parents are coming, they're so close, I promise. Just hang on. John, just stay with me, okay? Stay with me. John, just stay with me. You're gonna make it, John. You are, I promise you. You can do this, please, John. Please. John? Jonathan. John? - Dr. Jordan? You need to call it. Time of death, 3:15AM. - You can keep it if you've lost yours. I know how hard moving can be. - It wasn't for me, it was for the patient, nurse Smything. - Oh, great, honey. - Hey. - - Hi. - You're home. - Are you okay? - - Yeah. - Yeah? Baby, these are our neighbors. Harold and Francine Stone. - Hi, I'm Rebecca. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Hi. - And they brought homemade cookies. - Oh, wow. Not right now, thanks. Homemade, wow that's so kind of you. - Well, we're foodies so any excuse to get in the kitchen is a good one for Harold. - Hey, I earned that. Actually, Francine and I were just talking the other day about how we needed some new blood in the neighborhood so we'd love to have you guys over for dinner. - Yeah, as soon as the hospital gives her some time to breathe, we'd love that. - That's right. Congratulations on the residency. It's a fantastic hospital. - Yeah, I feel pretty lucky about it. - So, how does that work? I mean, they just choose where you go and you pack up your life and move there for four years? 'Cause that just sounds rough. - Um, well actually... - Just Google it, Harold. The poor woman just got off work, okay? Let's just let her relax. - Sorry. - And we love your plans for the house, by the way. Very impressive. - Yeah, we're pretty excited about it too. - It's a lot of work but I think it'll be worth it. - And then we still have to sort through all the belongings from Mr. Vanderhorst. My goodness, he had such an odd assortment of things. - So he just walked away? - Did you know him? - Uh, no. - No. I mean, I waved at him a few times from the mail box but that's it. - Well the brokers said that his wife passed away recently? And he just wanted to put this house and his whole life behind him, I guess. - So sad. - Not unusual, though. I mean, statistically speaking, men who outlive their wives don't live very long. And that's why you have to live forever. - Forever? - Forever and ever. - Well, okay then. - Let's go, old man. - Yes, ma'am. - Oh, a hug. Okay, thank you. Thanks so much for the cookies and the teddy bear. - Teddy bear? - Nope, that's a actually a gift from the house. Yeah, I found it in the wall. I thought it was a possum, it scared the shit out of me. - Well, there's one more for the collection then. - You collect teddy bears? - Uh, no. - Phew. - But Mr. Vanderhorst certainly did. - Yeah, a lot of 'em. - 400 of them. - Really? - No shit. You know, I've heard that old teddy bears can be worth a lot of money, like there was one guy on Craigslist who was... - Honey. - I'll Google it, I'll Google it. See you guys. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Hi. Internal damage. The brain haemorrhage was just too much. I was really hoping that he could see his family before he passed. They were 10 minutes out, Todd. They were so close. - You know, maybe it's a good thing that they didn't make it. That they didn't see him that way. You know? - Yeah. I wanna be there for you, and you for me in our last moment of life. I want it to just be us. The last thing we see and know. - If you're last thing that I see, when I die, then I'll be happy, 'cause then I know I'll already be in heaven. - Oh my god. That is the best and worst thing I've ever heard. - I hate you so much. - I love you so much. God, you're so sweet. You're so sweet, thank you. The candles are so beautiful. - Just wait until I get that gas line installed for the fireplace. Then whoosh. As you wish, my lady. - Oh god, you know how I love it when you spoil me with technology. - And fine cuisine. Don't forget the hours I've spent slaving over a hot phone. - Perish the thought, master chef. - Oh, you belittle me with your giggles. You see, this is man's work. You couldn't possibly understand. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. - Me thinks you doth protest too much. - Is that right? - Oh, yeah. Uh, pardon me, ma'am, but I think, I think you've got some dry rot in your timbers and your transom. - Oh really? Is that how you see me, as this old house guy? - If the shoe fits, partner. - Is that right? - Mm-hm. - Okay. Well you know what this calls for. - What? - Bear fight. - Oh! - Come on! - Oh-ho! - Huh? - Oh yeah, butt first! Oh, god! Okay! In the face! - Come on! Come on! - Oh, don't be a feared little fella! I ain't gonna hurts ya! I'm gonna get you! Todd? Todd? Ow! God, you dick! - Oh baby, I'm sorry, are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay! - I was just playing. - Well that bear isn't, that shit is hard! Oh, there's something inside this. - Easy... Easy... - Oh my god, Todd, there's definitely something in here. Todd, it's a book. - It's a diary. No no, you do the honors, doctor. - Me? Okay. How do I... - Okay seriously, I mean... Okay baby, I don't know how you're ever gonna make surgeon with a grip like that. - Ha ha, you are so fucking... - My god! - - Hey, I got it. - No, it's small, really it's nothing. - No, my kit's upstairs. - It just scared me. - No, I don't care. These hands are worth millions so we're gonna get you upstairs, we're gonna get you cleaned up. And then you're going to bed, young lady. - Oh, yeah. Oh, my big strong man. Oh I love it when you take charge, you know that? - As you wish, eh? - Oh my god, that's so bad. Todd! Todd, you let me sleep in too late. - You looked too cute, I didn't wanna wake you. - Really, you are sch a sweet-talker. - True. - I'm seriously late. - Okay. - - Coffee. - Coffee? - Mm-hm. - I only have time for one sip. - All right. - Yeah, that's good. All right. I gotta run. - Made you breakfast. - Really? You are the best husband ever, you know that? I love you. - Go save lives! - Howdy, neighbor. - Oh hi, Harold! You can make me make you Make me smarter We can work, we can work We can work You can tell me what you want to tell me We can work, we can work We can work - What's up, doc? - You tell me. Oh, damnit. Really? - At least the breakers work. - Oh god, Todd, fix it. - I got a better idea. Will you tell me what you want to tell me You can make me make you Make me smarter - Oh, Sweety I had the strangest... - Hey there, sleepy head. - Harold. Francine. Morning. Hello. - Morning, gorgeous. - Morning. - Sleep okay? - Think so. So you always make breakfast for your neighbors? - Just the ones we like. The others we burn at the stake. - You are horrible. We were just on our way home from the store and we saw your big strong man without his coffee mug. So we thought we would do our civil duty. - And make him fat, like me. - Seduced by the dark side. - Honestly, I'm just trying to bribe him into giving me some free advice. Francine's just my coworker in crime. - Well, you paid your dues. Take your pound of flesh. - All right, our plan worked, honey. We are off to landscape town. - Love you, baby. - I love you. - I am sorry if we set you off. - Oh, no you've been so welcoming. - Thank you. - - You're sweet. I'm not sure how I'd react to another woman in my kitchen. Especially so early in the morning, but you are a dear. We will get out of your way, right away. - No need. - Okay then. Well I promise to rein Harold in and you just enjoy your breakfast. I said it was too early, but when he saw Todd out there... Harold just loves to think he knows everything about everything. He will not call a plumber until we're practically drowning. Or an exterminator unless we're overwhelmed by rats. Rebecca? Oh my god. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm... I'm okay, I'm just tired, and the hours at the hospital wear me out. - And my cooking doesn't help. - I'm sorry. - - No, no no. It's not you, really, it's just... I'm stressed from work and the house and the new hospital. - I understand, more than you know. What you need is a night out. A girls' night. Get your glow on. - World's biggest bird cage. Glad I'm not cleaning it. - Right. It seemed kind of odd it just standing there all broken. It'd make a great park or something. - You'd have to talk to the city about that. They haven't been listening for about 70 years. I think they're waiting on some big company to make a bid and make it worth their while. Then all our property values go up. - Anyway, there's this pond I'm gonna rehab. Based on the foliage it looks like they set up some sort of English garden. What? - English garden? No, that was their burn barrel. They got rid of their garbage in that hole. - Really? Like, what, leaves? - Trash and plastic, whatever they want to get rid of. There were no recycling bins back then, just, fire and smoke. You scratch the surface we're all just an inch above the dark ages. - Yeah, I guess I'm romanticizing it a bit, huh? - You should. It's your house. Your home. Fall in love. - No no, I'm good. Those will kill you. - Truth, but if you're already in the train, you might as well enjoy the ride. - What does that mean? - Lung cancer. Got the eviction notice four months ago. - Shit, I'm sorry. Harold, I didn't mean to make a joke about it. - Don't apologize. Nobody lives forever. - God, longest seconds ever. Okay. What the hell does this mean? Oh, come on. Come on. Oh. Oh wow. - Hey, baby? I got the washer nuts for the tub faucet. - Can I get in there? - - Yeah, okay. Um... Okay. - Give me a second. - - I really gotta pee. - All right, just give me a minute. I'll be right out. - All right, hang on! - - I really gotta pee! - Yeah, one minute, I know, I know. I'll be right out. You scared me. - Uh, the shank came off, and the knob. Yeah. - You all right? - - Yeah. - Okay, just give me a few minutes, all right? - Okay, yeah yeah. - Get out. See you in a few, thanks baby. - Okay. - Okay. Hey hey. - Hey, how's the faucet? - It's perfect. Easy fix. - Oh, good. - How you feelin'? - Good. I'm just tired, you know? - You seemed a little sick after breakfast. - Yeah, too much greasy bacon. - Maybe you just got the flu from work or something. - Um, no it's not the flu. - Is there anything else that you think it might be? I dropped my wrench in the trash. - Todd, I was just gonna... I was gonna tell you. I just needed to figure out how to tell you. - How to tell me. Baby, we're a team. - I just wasn't thinking. - You hid this in the garbage. I mean, I'm sorry but that is fucked up, honey. - Okay, you know what? I don't wanna get into an argument about this. So let's just talk about this later. - We're gonna talk about this right now. - How long have you known? - - I just told you! I found out just now! - Rebecca, you are a doctor! Of medicine! How long have you known? - I didn't wanna say anything until I was sure, okay? - Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. I really do, I understand that, but don't fuckin' protect me from our lives. - God, why are you getting so angry? - I'm not angry, I'm intense, okay? Intense. Involved. This is supposed to be our decision. - What is that supposed to mean? - I wanted to have a kid with you. When we are ready. - Oh, so you're not ready now? - Don't play that game with me. You know that I wanna have kids with you. I just also wanna have you with you. And the last five years have been... - Past five years, Todd? What, what? Tell me about the past five years, what? - The last five years have been about supporting you. School, studying, the residency. It's all been about you becoming the doctor you wanna be and that's okay, I understand that! - Well I'm so sorry that you were really fucking supportive, okay? - Don't! - God! - Hey, this is us! All right? Us. And I just wanted to have some time being together. Creating a life together. Spoiling you with no fucking responsibilities. Just us, all right? I wanted to have a fucking choice. - I didn't plan this. And you know what? I'm not sorry. But I am sorry that you're not happy. - I'm fucking ecstatic! I fucking love you! And I wanna have kids with you, it's just this is... Fuck this is a lot! You know? It's a fucking lot! Fuck! Cheers to you, buddy. There you go. I'm gonna be daddy. Wow. Becca? - Dear diary. Today is my 11th birthday. I wanted a doggy so we could adventure together, but Daddy said I wasn't responsible enough. So, instead I got you, Dear Diary, and a rad new bike. So I guess you could say that I'm a pretty lucky girl. Dear diary. Today new people moved in down the street. A family with a boy and girl my age. The girl's named Delia and the boy is Robert. He says they're adopted, but, they don't look adopted to me. He says that he's gonna be a New York Yankee one day. I think I like him. I gave Delia Mr. Tickles 'cause she likes him so much and maybe Daddy will think I'm responsible enough to have a puppy for my next birthday, if I don't have little kid toys. But, I miss him already. Dear diary. Robbie's mom got super-mad that we were playing explorers in the meadow and said that I could have gotten them hurt with my stupidity. I'm not stupid. They are stupid. They don't even let Delia and Robbie go to school like me. It's not fair. I hope their butts fall off. Dear diary. A girl from my school got disappeared, and nobody found her. Her mom came into the school. She doesn't have a dad 'cause she's a latchkey kid. Principle Clark talked to us in the gym about stranger danger. Back in class, Miss B. told us to go home holding hands with our safety partners. I feel sad, even though I didn't know her. Dear diary. Robbie told me his new mom and dad keep secret stuff down in the basement. So we're gonna investigate like Nancy Drew. We looked into the basement. It was all dark, but then I saw something move and I heard a song. I can't remember what I saw. It's like my head doesn't want to. But the song, I kept on hearing the song. It was like a church song, but mad. It was so mad. - You okay? - Why do you have a weapon? - Uh... I heard something and... - So you brought that? - Yeah. There was a shadow and then there's a noise so I... Yeah. - Todd. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I should have told you when I even first suspected. I just couldn't bear to get my hopes up. Todd, I love you so much. - We're having a baby. Go save lives. - Love you. - I know. Son of a bitch. That's it. All right. It's a brownout? We paid the bills so why is this... Oh, come on. Okay. I got this. Let's see. That's the wall. That's the front yard. That's the... Water heater. All right. Shit. Come on! Hello? What are you doing down here? - It burns. - It's okay. I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. What's your name? It's okay. What's your name? Why don't we find your parents? - It burns. - Okay, he's stable but he can't sleep for another four hours, so make sure you keep him in your line of sight. - Get him food, walk him around. - Yes, exactly. Compound fracture in 1A? - X-ray is done, no internal lacerations, bleeding's stopped, ready for reset within the hour. - Good. Thank you. Okay, what's next? - Grab a Red Bull. You've got a long night. - Dr. Jordan, we have a second-degree-burn victim. Just came in. Might be self-inflicted. - Okay, who's doing triage? What room is he in? - 1C, he's prepped and stable. - Sedatives? Painkillers? - Morphine and narcex. - Just give me a moment, okay? I need to check... - No, Dr. Jordan. It's your husband. - Oh my god. Todd, what happened? How did you... - A girl, she... She was on fire. And grabbed me. She grabbed me. - What? What, Todd? Look at me, sweetheart. Okay? Focus, and I need you to tell me. What happened? - She was on fire. From the inside. - Okay. Okay, all right. I'm gonna look at this, okay? - How is he? - Harold? - I called 911. I heard him screaming when I was outside having a smoke. I thought your house was gonna burn down. - What? Harold, what happened to him? - He came stumbling down the stairs, holding his arms out in front of him. I tried to help but he was so out of it, so I called and came over with the ambulance and... - Sir, this is for family only. You need to be in the lobby. - No no, he's fine. - It's okay. You stay here. I'll take care of the paperwork, you take care of him. - Thank you. Okay, let's lay you down here. Okay, sweetheart? There you go. Just like that. - The girl. - Todd. It's okay. - She was... - Shh. It's okay. - From the inside. - Okay. It's okay. Shh. - Dear diary. Susie Mortez is missing. She went to a different school than me. Now I have to stay in the yard. No more adventures with Robbie and Delia. They waved at me from their yard, but their mom called them back inside like I did something bad. Dear diary. The police took Robbie's dad today. He had blood on him and yelled at the policemen. Robbie and Delia wouldn't talk to me. Their mom was crying. I've never seen a mom cry. She ran up to me and gave me Mr. Tickles, then Robbie and Delia took her inside, like she was a kid. Dear Diary. Dad said he took the disappeared girls. That's why the policemen took Robbie's dad away. Dear diary. I saw Robbie and Delia. They were outside my room. Dad said no one was there, but they were. They were there. I don't wanna get disappeared. Dear diary. Mom and Dad won't listen. Maybe it's better. I don't want Robbie and Delia to hurt them 'cause of me. I'm scared. I don't wanna get disappeared. But if I do, I know you won't forget me. You can remember me if I'm gone. - I think that the last time that I saw you I said some things that seemed a little crazy but it's not me. It's not me. Look, I know that you're a doctor and people come in and say crazy shit all the time. - I believe you. - What? - I believe you about the girl. She was on fire. - Yeah, she was on fire. Where did you... - I saw her in the house. I think I know who she is, Todd. - How? How could you? - She's that girl from the diary. Something happened to her. Todd, something really bad happened to that little girl. - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah? - - Yeah. Oh, we have dinner tonight with Harold and Francine. It's like a welcome home dinner, okay? - Yeah. That sounds good. I don't know what I would have done without him. So what are we gonna do, about this fire child? - I got this from nurse Smything. I'm gonna check the hospital records later tonight when it's just the skeleton crew. - What? How? - Her name is on the front cover of the journal. - That was delicious. - Yes. - Thank you. - Only the best for us. We have an organic butcher in Valley Village. Local-grown. - I'll have to borrow him. - Oh, do you want me to put the salad in the fridge? - Relax. You open another bottle of wine. - We've got this. - - Oh, okay. - Women. The more the world changes, the more they stay the same. - Yeah, don't let Rebecca hear you say that. - I think the spirits have made me fearless. - I thought we were gonna light it up together. Get my Frenchy going. - One's my limit. - You mean, half. - Oh, I'm watching my figure. - For the both of you? - Really? How did you know? - My cooking's not that bad. - That's quite the bottle opener. - Our illustrious patron. Allow me to introduce you to Lieutenant Colonel James Smyth Burget. First Baronet of Easton and the director of the East India Trading Company. The spring from whence all our riches bubble forth. - Really? Grandpa? - Um, many greats, but yes. - Oh. Sounds great. - Actually, he didn't start that way. He was volunteered into the East India Army's foreign cavalry where apparently he was rather adept at um, "converting the savages." - New world term for old world massacre. - Uh-huh. Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, given a directorship in the company with shares. - Kinda like buying a stock in Apple Computers in 1976. - Exactly. - Wow, so you're a baron. - No. The title died with him, but the shares gave birth to a family of ne'er-do-wells that continue to this day. - And of course the nouveau riche always settle in the suburban neighborhoods. - We prefer to call it "mingling with the lower classes" purely subterfuge for our nefarious plots. It's not the golden ticket people imagine, but it does allow us to travel and pursue alternative cancer treatments whilst keeping a roof over our heads and for that I'll always be eternally grateful to the old man. - Sounds like a hell of a guy. - The Maharaj called him Burget, "the beast." So you've got the location right. - More ancestors? - Ah. August and Drusilla. Apples from the poison tree. Great year. - Yeah? You sure? - Definitely. - You and Harold have children? - Didn't stick. - You two are just great together. A lot of people your age don't have kids nowadays. - My age? You have no idea. - I just meant that you both seem really happy together. - Every day, it's like I won the lottery. Every day. - Um, Francine your blouse is wet. Might wanna... - Let it dry. Lighten up, doc. You've got plenty of wardrobe malfunctions coming your way. - What do you mean? - A breast-feeding mother will lactate at the sound of a baby. Just the sound. Even if you're not aware of it, your body is. And it behaves as if it doesn't even belong to you. - Hm. - Thank you. - Oh, any time. - I hope not. - You don't have to thank me. - Yes we do. - He only did what any good neighbor would do. - Yes but it was you. - Do you remember much? - Uh no, not really. I remember being in the basement and, then I remember your face as I went into the ambulance. - "She's on fire." That's what you kept on saying. "She's on fire." - I, um... I saw something when I went down there. And it burnt me. - Old wires. - No. It was a girl. It was a little girl screaming, on fire. We've both seen her. - You got off lucky. - I'm not sure. - We found a diary in the walls. - It's a little girl's diary. - Yeah, Rebecca thinks that the little girl... - Katie, her name's Katie. - Katie is the little girl in the diary. Rebecca thinks that she's the one that... - Set you on fire. - Yeah. - I've seen her myself. In dreams and in waking life. This is something that I never imagined believing from somebody else but, it's true. I've felt it. I've felt her. - Do you know the history of this neighborhood? Anything that would make this crazy shit make sense. - Well. The average house price is going up 12.7% but that's what my real estate agent told me when we bought the place so, flaming girls weren't really a sell point. I'm sorry, guys. - No, I guess so. - Who wants creme brulee? - Oh. You gotta be kidding. My god. Okay. Get it together, Becks, come on. All right. All right. Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst. Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst. V, V, V, V, Vanderhorst. Come on. Really? There we go. V. V for Vanderhorst. Vanderhorst. Okay. All right. V, V, V, where are you? Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst. Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst. Where are you? Vanderhorst. Vanderhorst! Vanderhorst, Vanderhorst. Oh, Jesus. Todd? - Hello? - Sweety? - Rebecca. - Rebecca, hello? - - Todd. Can you hear me? The reception's kind of shaky. I'm down in the basement. - Yeah, okay. - Listen, there's nothing on her file. It just stops as if she transferred hospitals. - That's because she went missing. - What? - Honey, look for a file on Linda Cruthers. - Who is she? - She's her alleged kidnapper. She was sent to a sanitarium nearby. She might still be alive. - Todd, what? What? - Hello? Honey. - Damnit. Okay. Cruthers. Cruthers. I don't understand. Why isn't it here? Shit. Linda Cruthers. - Hello? Health Institute. How may I help you? - Hi, this is Rebecca Jordan from Seeders. Isn't Linda Cruthers still a patient at your facility? - What is this in regards to, please? - I was hoping to visit her. Ask her some questions? - Are you a family member? - No, but... - I'm sorry, we don't allow visitors. - My residency is in neurology. I was hoping to do a medical evaluation of her. - Has this been cleared by your supervisor? - Yes. They believe she's a perfect candidate. - Be here at 9AM. Parking is in the north-east corner. Bring all necessary paperwork and credentials. - Oh excuse me, can you tell me where... - Okay? You ready? - Mm-hm. Help me! - May I help you? - Um yes, we're here to see Linda Cruthers. - You called earlier? - Yes. - Credentials? That's good, doctor. I'm sure she'll be real happy to see you. - Really? - Yeah. No one's ever been to see her but her children. Not since I've been here. - When was the last time they visited? - A few days ago. Sign in, please. You'll need these. - Thank you. - I'll take you. I'll be right outside if you need me. - Thank you. Mrs. Cruthers. We need to talk to you. I know it's been a very long time, but we need you to help us find Katherine Vanderhorst. - Or at least her remains. - Mrs. Cruthers, you were the last person to see her alive. She wrote about you in her diary. Please. Help us. Do the right thing and make this right. - You destroyed lives, families, with what you did. Try to make it right, before you die. - Todd. - No, no. This woman is responsible for some terrible shit. This is her one chance. - Clinically insane, Todd. - She's not responsible. - - No. I can't buy that, Becca. Not with what we've seen. This is a waste of time. Let's go. - Mr. Tickles. Mr. Tickles. - Did you say something? - I missed you so bad, Mr. Tickles. - Did you give Katie the teddy bear? - Katie gave him to me. For keeps. No escapees. - So Katie gave you the bear. - Katie did. Katie was Nancy Drew. Me and Robbie, were Bess and George. We played adventures. - Okay, Linda. Where did you play? Where did you go with Katie? - Jungles. In Africa. In France, on the Eiffel Tower. It hummed at us. But the grass was soft. And Mr. Tickles always found the best clues for Nancy. - Linda, where is that? Would Katie have gone there alone? Linda, where did Katie go? - Delia. - What? Todd, what did she just say? - Delia, I'm Delia. - Okay, okay. - I'm Delia. - Okay, Delia. Okay. Now where did Katie go? - They took her to France. And they lit up the Eiffel Tower like fireworks. And then... And then it all went dark. - Who is "they?" - I can't tell you. They'd punish me. They'd find out. They always do. - All right she's had enough, Bec, come on. Let's go. - No! You see me? You see me? This is not my skin. They took my skin and put me inside this! He sees me, he knows who I am! This is not my skin! This is not my skin! No! This is not my skin! - Delia! - No! No! No no! This is not my skin! - That was a dead end. - Yeah. - What, Todd? What's wrong? - I don't... Something isn't right. - She had a psychotic break. - No, it's not that. - She's talking gibberish, Todd. - It's something that she said. Look out there. - What? The House? - No no, the transformer. - Okay? - What does it look like? - It looks like a transformer, Todd. - No no, but if you were a little girl, what does it look like? Imagine you're 11-years-old on vacation in France. - The Eiffel Tower. - Yeah, exactly. - But how did you know? - We pass by it every day. We can see it from our yard. - And you thought Eiffel Tower? - No no, it's what she said. - What? - Linda. She said that, "and then it went dark." There was a blackout the day Katie went missing. - You think she's out there, Todd? Todd, that symbol, I've seen it before. - Holy shit. - Oh my god. - I'm so sorry, little one. You deserved so much more. So much more than this. - We need to call the police. Forensics. Get them out here so she can finally be at peace. - We found you, Katie. You can go now. You're safe. - Do you... - Yes. - Dear diary. Robbie told me his new mom and dad keep secret stuff down in the basement. So we're gonna investigate like Nancy Drew. Dear Diary. The police took Robbie's dad today. He had blood on him and yelled at the policemen. Dad said he took the disappeared girls. That's why the policemen took Robbie's dad away. - Everyone back! - Robbie? Delia? What? - It's me, it's me. It's me. Delia, it's me. - It's not my skin. It's not my skin. It's me. It's me. Dear diary. I saw Robbie and Delia. They were outside my room. Dad said no one was there, but they were. Dear diary. Mom and Dad won't listen. Maybe it's better. I don't want Robbie and Delia to hurt them 'cause of me. I'm scared. I don't wanna get disappeared. But if I do, I know you won't forget me. You can remember me if I'm gone. Goodbye, Mr. Tickles. - Oh my god, Harold and Francine. - We've got what we need and we're gone. - The authorities. - And tell them what? Who's gonna believe us? Honey, we're not safe here. - What about the house, Todd? - I don't give a shit about that house. I care about you, and our little baby. The rest is storage. Come on. You grab the cash, I'll grab the clothes! Becca! No. Please don't. - Please don't hurt, just let her go. Please. Okay. Please! Please. No! - Mom says hi. Her last words. - Loved the teddy bear. - Please stop. Whatever you need you can have, just... Just please stop. - Whatever I want? What do you think that you could give me? Hm? - Anything. Anything, just let her go. Take anything. - Oh. I will. - What do you want? - We're leaving, we're not even a threat to you. - You never were. - I want you, to cut yourself. - What? - Cut yourself across the heart. Out of love. - No. - No? It wasn't a request, Toddles. But don't worry. You're playing with a partner. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Baby. I'm sorry. - Aw. They're adorable. - I told you they were a lovely couple. - Sweet as pie. We've had our eye on you, kitten. - You. You're so special. - The boy's got gumption! Tenacious! I like it! - Mm, very sexy. - May I? - Of course August. - I'll be back for you. - Run, Todd, he's coming! - Front-row seats. - Todd. Toddy, Toddy, Toddy. - Come on! Come on, Harold! Come on! Come on, you motherfucker! - I love what you've done with the place. Strong bones. Nice frontage. Of course, I'll have to change the locks and clean the carpets. - Nice shot, Todd. Now me. - But I just love to nest. Especially with two babies on board. - I like the fight in you, son, but your round is over. - Are you the devil? - No. For Satan is a sign of God. The fallen Zion must have a father, and he is not mine. But pray to him if you want. It changes nothing. It never does. Try harder. - You took their souls. - No. Swapped. Traded in for an upgrade. New chassis. Same engine. And now daddy wants a new ride. Here comes the dark. Finally. Wouldn't be the same without you. - That's enough, Harold. - That's not my name. - Whoever the fuck you are, this ends now! - Not the way you think. - Todd. - Go. Go, baby, go. - Shh. - Get somewhere safe. - Todd. - Todd, look at me. - - I'm okay. - I'm here. I'm here right beside you. Look at me. - But I'm leaving. - Please stay. You can't leave me. Please stay, Todd. - I never will. - Todd, you can't leave me. Todd, Todd. Todd, no. - You shouldn't be up, Sweety. I won't tell. I couldn't keep me away if it was me either. Do you have any names yet? - She will be Drusilla. And he is August. - So Todd is his middle name? - No. Why?
