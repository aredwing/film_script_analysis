Before l was born... when l was in the tummy of my mother... my father would always say a tappa, a Pashtun story. lf you look at the world map... on the east side, you can find a country called Afghanistan. Long ago, it had a fight with another country called England. The Afghan people, they were losing hope. And a teenager saw the fighters running away. She goes up to the mountain. She raised her voice. (SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE) Which simply means... it is better to live like a lion for one day... than to live like a slave for a hundred years. She encouraged the people of Afghanistan. (HORSE WHINNYING) (EXPLOSION) She led the army to a great victory. But she was shot... and she died on that battlefield. Her name was Malalai. When l was in coma, l had these terrible dreams. And l was thinking that l was dead. NEWSCASTER 1: Lying near death... NEWSCASTER 2: A 15-year-old was shot for standing up to the Taliban. NEWSCASTER 3: Tonight, Malala remains in intensive care. NEWSCASTER 4: She was shot in the head by the Taliban... for daring to suggest girls should go to school. NEWSCASTER 5: Now millions around the world are watching to see... if she will die for her cause. MALALA: When l opened my eyes... l did not know where l was. l realized that this is not my country. And l thought, ''No one knows what's my name. '' l saw nurses and doctors. DR. REYNOLDS: When she first woke up, her first question was... ''Where's my father?'' ZIAUDDIN: We were thinking, ''What Malala will be thinking?'' ''l was a child. You should have stopped me. ''What has happened to me is because of you. '' MALALA: lt is an honor for me to be speaking again... ZIAUDDIN: Come, Malala, come! What is the problem? MALALA: I Iost my shoes. (CONVERSING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) It's okay. (BOTH CONTINUE CONVERSING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) Don't make tea Iike this, Dad. How? I don't Iike it Iike this. It's okay, try it. (PLAYING) ZIAUDDIN: AtaI Khan Yousafzai, I'm waiting for you to take breakfast. (WOMEN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) MALALA: This is my youngest brother. He's a reaIIy good boy. He has a Iot of energy. He wouId demand us that, ''Oh, I want to pIay goIf, and I want to''... -This is the Iaziest one. -(SIGHS ) You see? Look at the first impression! ZIAUDDIN: One, two, three. Start. MALALA: His name is KhushaI Khan Yousafzai, and... and he's a okay boy. Wait, wait, wait! You don't get to use two hands. KHUSHAL: This is MaIaIa Yousafzai. She's the naughtiest girI on the earth. One, two, three, go. It's not fair. Come on, then. (LAUGHING) -No! -(ZIAUDDIN SPEAKING) KhushaI! You are somebody's son! (SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE) KHUSHAL: PeopIe think that she is reaIIy kind and she speaks for peopIe's rights... but that's not true. In home, she is so vioIent. MALALA: I'm not vioIent! I wouId request my brother... not to say any bad thing about me. He shouId onIy praise me. I pIay with them, I fight with them. I get a IittIe bit naughty, but that's fine. That's my right. She's a IittIe bit naughty. That much. GUGGENHEIM: What does she do? She just sIaps me every time when I meet her. When I come from schooI. When my brother's fighting with me, you come and rescue me. When I go to your room, you sIap me there as weII! (MALALA LAUGHS ) ATAL: That's kind of confusing. Save me from one and hit me in the other one. He's saying I beat KhushaI and then I protect AtaI... but when I take him to my room, then I myseIf give him a sIap. (BOTH LAUGHING) (MIMICS SLAPPING) -She sIap on my... -ZIAUDDIN: It's out of Iove. MALALA: It's just for Iove. It is not a Iove! It is a sign of Iove. It's a sign of... -how much I Iove you and... -ZIAUDDIN: Compassion. ...how sweet and cute you are for me. That's why I give you a sIap on your face. (MACHINE WHIRRING) When you Iaugh, do you get any pain down here? -MALALA: No. -Okay. This pIace is tight. This one. These ones. -Say ''speciaI''. -SpeciaI. -Now say ''feeI.'' -FeeI. -''Freddy.'' -Freddy. No pain when you stretch it Iike that? Mmm-hmm. There it feeIs a IittIe bit tight. The nerve doesn't seem to stimuIate this muscIe? That's unIikeIy to come back. The damage was too severe. (REPORTERS CLAMORING) (MALALA SPEAKING) I don't know where the voice is coming from. CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: It's okay. Look there. MALALA: When l was in Pakistan, it was a different world for me. Here, l have just spent one year only. l don't really understand this new society and these new rules. -(DOG BARKS ) -MALALA: Oh, dear! It's a dog! (LAUGHS ) WOMAN: Sorry, MaIaIa. -MAN: You aII right? -It's fine. l want people to learn from the experience l had... and the story of my life. They want you aIone, so Iook there, and then there. So, the name of the show is The Daily Show? -Very nice to see you. -Nice to see you. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Okay, straight. AMANPOUR: The Queen of England has invited you to the Palace. (BOTH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) MARGARET WARNER: With all these public appearances, do you have any semblance of a normal life? Take a deep breath. Just reIax your hands. -(SIGHS ) -(PHOTOGRAPHER LAUGHS ) Look to this side. No, you're good. Thank you. You're very good. -Which camera now? -WeII... -(ALL LAUGH) -I'm done. MALALA: We couldn't go to market, we were not allowed to go to school. And that's why l spoke, because l believe in equality... and l believe that there is no difference between a man and a woman. l even believe that a woman is more powerful than men. -What? Wait. -(AUDIENCE CHEERING) ZIAUDDIN: You shouId teach me how to use the Twitter. Hmm? It's your next tweet. ZIAUDDIN: No, you didn't find it. Yeah, I have it. Do you want to write something with it? Mmm... No, it's okay. It's seIf-expIanatory. Just send a Iink to aII, to everybody. Let me see your Facebook. Why don't I know how to tweet yet? This is very bad. -(TABLET TWEETS ) -MALALA: Tweeted. -It's tweeted? -Mmm-hmm. Papa, Iook down. (SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE) ZIAUDDIN: When she was very small, many friends used to come to our home. We used to talk about politics, we used to talk about the basic rights... and she used to sit with us. MALALA: When l was young, l used to listen to him. Like, what is he saying, how he talks. ZIAUDDIN: We became dependent on each other. Like one soul in two different bodies. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) Who wouId you have been if you were just an ordinary girI from the Swat VaIIey? If I was an ordinary girI in Swat VaIIey... I'm stiII an ordinary girI. But if I had an ordinary father and an ordinary mother... and a conservative famiIy... then I wouId have two chiIdren now. So this wouId have been my future. You wouId have seen MaIaIa sitting with her two babies. GUGGENHEIM: You named her after a girI who spoke out... and was kiIIed for speaking out. It's aImost as if you said... ''She will be separate from the worId, ''she will be an activist abroad. ''She'II be different from all the other women ''in Swat and Pakistan.'' You are right. ZIAUDDIN: lt was very early in the morning... when the night goes, and the morning and the day comes. A girl, whose mother was helping my wife in the delivery of the child, came to me. She told me, ''A child has come to your home. '' lt was a kind of attachment from the very first moment l saw her. A few days after, my cousin brought the family tree. lt traced back for 300 years. No woman was mentioned. Only men were there. l took the pen, draw a line... and wrote ''Malala. '' (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TABLET) (MALALA LAUGHING) (PHONE RINGING) RADIO HOST: Malala, thank you for joining us. Thank you so much. The Taliban have said that if you return to Pakistan, they will kill you. How do you feel about such threats? MALE NEWS ANCHOR: On the one-year anniversary of Malala 's attack... the Taliban said they would target her again. FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: Malala has often said she wants to return to Pakistan... in spite of the death threats. DR. REYNOLDS: The bullet hit Malala 's forehead... shattering her skull inwards. Fragments of bone were driven into her brain. DR. ROSSER: The bullet destroyed both her eardrum and the tiny bones within the middle ear. MALALA: My father said, ''Have you forgiven them?'' GUGGENHEIM: All this time, you've never feIt angry? No. Not even as small as an atom, or maybe a nucIeus of an atom... or maybe a proton, or maybe a quark. GUGGENHEIM: Never angry? Never. lslam teaches us humanity... equality, forgiveness. It doesn't matter for me if my Ieft side of my face isn't working... or if I cannot bIink this eye properIy. It doesn't matter for me if I can't smiIe properIy. It doesn't matter that I'm not hearing in this ear. I can't hear. When the Taliban came to Swat, everyone thought that they are good people. (MULLAH FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) Any objections will Ieave your mind. And any questions will be answered, too. ZIAUDDIN: Mullah was very charming... very popular in the area. He was the talk of the town. Everybody used to discuss him. (FAZLULLAH CONTINUES SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) May God end your sadness and stress. May God give honor and respect, even to your chiIdren. MALALA: He was called ''Radio Mullah ''... and he would give sermons on the radio every day. (SERMON CONTINUES ) MALALA: His sermons could be heard by everyone in the town. The most popular part of his show came every evening... when he would read out people's names. People liked to hear which of their neighbors was sinful. (BOTH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Mom, are you happy? (TOOR CHUCKLES ) I Iike it here, but it's not Iike home. I miss Swat a Iot. One day, I was standing by the window Iooking at the moon, and I cried a Iot. I toId the moon, you're the onIy thing that is the same, but everything eIse here is different. MALALA: We lived only 100 miles from our capital, lslamabad... but we were separated by a great mountain pass. And for a time, our isolation meant we lived in a paradise. Life was normal, life was happy. l was able to go to the streets and play with my friends. Play hide-and-seek and running games. l miss the dirty streets. l miss the river. l miss my friends. ln this new school, it's quite difficult. To be really honest... l don't feel comfortable when people can see my legs. So my skirt is longer than most of the girls'. And then, my Iife is quite different than their Iife. Most of them have boyfriends. Most of them have broke up with some of the boyfriends and found new ones. It's quite difficuIt to tell girIs who really I am. l don't know whether they would like me, or whether they're interested in me. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) ln Kenya, there are so many girls who cannot go to school. (SINGING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) (TEACHER SPEAKING) This schooI starts from grade nine. MALALA: Grade nine? Up to which grade? Up to grade 12, but, because we are still new, we onIy have grade 9 and 10. (SINGING CONTINUES ) I Iived in this country. I was born in this country called Pakistan... I was born in Swat Valley. There are more than 180 million peopIe. Most of them are youth. So, who wants to become a doctor? You want to. The crops that you are growing? The number one is wheat. Number two is rice. Number three is maize. Who wants to study history? That's great. The Iargest mountain? It's called K2. The Iongest river? It comes through these valleys and goes down, down, down, and through Sindh. What do you want to be? I'd Iike to become a Iawyer. -On this side? -Yeah. The girIs whose mother or father is educated, they shouId raise up their hands. ZIAUDDIN: l loved education. l loved to be a teacher. l started my own school... just with $150. We hired a small building. l was the sweeper. l was the manager. l was the headmaster. The very first day of my school, l stood and l recited the national anthem. There were three students, and it started. MALALA: l used to be in school all the day. l loved the way teacher was speaking. And l loved the way the students were listening carefully to the teacher... being all around with other girls and with teachers. l put in my student a kind of rebel against traditions, customs... and how to raise their voice. MALALA: l could not even speak properly, but... in my own language l would try to give lectures to the empty classrooms. School was my home. Moniba was here and then I was sitting next to her. Here was I. And here was Shazia, and here was Kainat. The Talib came here... and I was just very near to him... and then he asked, ''Who is MaIaIa?'' This is an easy one. (ALL SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Remember the symboIs and numbers. So you mean these signs in the middIe here? And then remember the number, too. Okay, choose a card in all these cards and then remember it. (SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE) You have to take it out, okay? Now see my tricks. (SHUFFLES CARDS ) -This is your card. -(LAUGHS ) (GASPS ) How do you do this? MALALA: The next two bullets hit Shazia and Kainat. GUGGENHEIM: Where did the bullet hit you? This right arm. Here. SHAZIA: This is the inside, and this was outside. MALALA: Two bullets hit Shazia. SHAZIA: And was my shouIder. MALALA: The bullet that hit her in her Ieft shouIder hit Kainat. So one bullet hit two of them... and one bullet went through the hand of Shazia. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) No other reIigion gives more rights to women. The Surah An-Nisaa ... ... is compIeteIy dedicated to women. A mother has her rights, a sister has her rights, a daughter has her rights. ZIAUDDIN: Mullah Fazlullah might be the first person in our history... to talk directly to women in Swat. He was a Pashto speaker... and he talked to people in their own language. MALALA: Sometimes he would say, ''Men, go outside now. l'm talking to the women. '' (TOOR SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) At first, he wouId say good things on the radio. There wouId be IsIam in our country, and everything wouId be done according to the Qur'an. We were pretty happy about that. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING ON SPEAKERS ) The book of God AImighty is unIike any other book. ZIAUDDIN: He took them into confidence. He used to taIk to women about their issues directIy. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) Dear sisters, don't be fooIed by superstitions. ZIAUDDIN: You see, our women are illiterate... ignorant from all other kind of information. When all other windows are closed... and the onIy window that is open to their mind that is FazIullah's window... uItimateIy that man will have an effect on them. MALALA: Like many women from Swat, my mother used to cover her face. Not for religion, but for tradition. Now in the U.K., she does not cover her face. She only covers her hair. Is my hair covered? Yes, it's covered. MALALA: Sometimes she says, ''Don't shake hand with men. ''Look down. Don't look at men. lt's a shame. '' And l said, ''lf men can look at me, ''why can't l look at them?'' She told me many times... ''Cover your face because ''people would think you are not a nice girl. '' (CONVERSING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) MALALA: But covering my face was something that... made me feel like l was just hiding my identity, who l was. (TOOR SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) So, which way is the house? I don't know. All the houses are the same over here. MALALA: l think she's not independent or free... because she's not educated. GUGGENHEIM: What are those yellow Post-its? MALALA: I want to increase my vocabuIary... because now I'm Iiving in an EngIish society... and I want to have good vocabuIary. GUGGENHEIM: I see ''cat burgIar.'' Why do you care about the word ''cat burgIar''? MALALA: Because I know what's a cat, but I didn't know what's a burgIar. So I have written... ''CAT BURGIAR: a thief who enters a buiIding... ''by cIimbing to an upper story.'' (LAUGHS ) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) School is quite complicated. It's really hard to find way. So there are blue stairs, red stairs, green stairs. lt's good that they colored it, otherwise I wouId have been Iost in my schooI. ATAL: She does all of her homework all the day. From 5:00 untiI 1 1 :00 or 1 :00, she does all her homework. GUGGENHEIM: Why? I don't know. EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY OFFICIAL: I award you the honorary degree of Master of Arts. I think she's addicted to books. That's all I know. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) GUGGENHEIM: lt's a terrible problem. Yeah. (LAUGHING) No, not really. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) MALALA: ln Swat, l was considered to be the top girl in the class. Getting high marks, good behavior. Nice to teachers, intelligent... Here, it's hard. lt's really difficult. (MALALA SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) I'm telling you it's different here. Here I'm not smart at all. JUDE KELLY: She's not going to take questions this morning. AIthough she is a profoundIy infIuentiaI worId Ieader... -she's aIso doing her GCSEs. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS ) Some peopIe think, ''MaIaIa is Iucky, she's now with... ''Hillary Clinton, she's with Bono, ''she's with rock stars. '' But on the other side, I get homework as well. GUGGENHEIM: Rock stars don't need to do homework. (LAUGHS ) I think rock stars are Iucky. When l told my school l wouldn't be at school for one week... the teachers gave me extra homework. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Shall I show you my tests and how much marks do I get? GUGGENHEIM: Yeah, show me. MALALA: It's really embarrassing. This is the bioIogy test. I got 73%. I'm good in the first questions, which is all about hormones. (LAUGHS ) (ALL SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) My name's MaIaIa. NORAH O'DONNELL: ls it true that when you spoke with President Obama... you talked about your concern that drone attacks are fuelling terrorism? Yes, of course. Because I missed that Iesson, I got onIy 1% in this question out of four. (CHILDREN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) MALALA: This is unfortunateIy Physics. GUGGENHEIM: What did you get? MALALA: In Physics, I got 61%. (GASPS ) GUGGENHEIM: So what do the girls do if they don't go to schooI? They cIean dishes... They buy things for other peopIe. I don't really know. They cIean dishes and they do their stuff. What's so wrong with that? I don't really know, but it's bad. MALALA: My mother, she was very beautiful. Green eyes, maroon color hair, fair skin. When she was five, she was admitted to school by my grandfather. She was the only girl in her class. She realized that all her female cousins were not going to school. They were playing in the fields. At that time, when you sold something, in return you would either get food... you would either get corn and flour. She got candies. Nobody asked her, ''Where are your books? ''Why are you not going to school?'' That was the end of her education. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) We have directed the music and video stores not to sell vuIgar photos, music, and CDs. ZIAUDDIN: They used to go from town to town... and they used to make a heap of all the computers, TVs, CDs... and burned them on fire. (CROWD CHANTING) (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) We are not against advancement, we are against shameIessness and vuIgarity. ZIAUDDIN: The smoke used to reach to the clouds. MALALA: They did not want us to watch the television. And if they heard it, ever, they wouId come into your house by force... they would take your TV and they would burn your television. PIease can you put the banana on the pIate. On the pIate? Yes. PIease pick up number 10. GUGGENHEIM: ls your mother happy here? I think she is not that happy because she doesn't have friends. She don't know the Ianguage well. But I think she will get used to it. My mother is like, the best mom, l think, ever. Maybe you have a speciaI connection to your mother. Yeah, she Ioves me. I'm the favorite one. Yeah, I'm her favorite one. Not MaIaIa? Quarter past... -Seven. -Yes. (LAUGHS ) ZIAUDDIN: The first time l saw her, she was 14. l was dark in color... so my physical appearance was not good in my eyes. And l thought that l'm not a handsome boy. l had not beauty, she had not education. She saw her compIetion in me and I saw my compIetion in her. GUGGENHEIM: ls it unusual to have a marriage of love? ZIAUDDIN: Love marriage in America and love marriage in Pakistan... are very different things. You can't have dates, you can't have romantic meetings. You onIy see someone, she sees you... and the next step is not any dating or any meeting. The next step is to tell your father and mother, ''I want that girI.'' (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) IsIam has given us the right to defend ourseIves. Any poIice or soIdier that attacks MusIims are infideIs! ZIAUDDIN: ln the very beginning, Fazlullah was not violent... but he became stronger and stronger and stronger. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) I am a seeker of knowIedge searching for the right path. As a MusIim, it's my duty to ... spread what I have Iearned to the pubIic, in the name of God. ZIAUDDIN: They started killing policemen and blasting police stations. MALALA: Taliban are a small group of people. They think that God is a tiny, little, conservative being. But for us, God is not that tiny. God has sent us to this world to see how would we live. Would they choose a bad way or a good way? -(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) -(CAMERAS CLICKING) My name is Shettima Harouna. My daughter is Margaret Shettima. My daughter is 17 years.

REPORTER 3: For three months, parents called for the safe return of their daughters. Now they hope it's the voice of a teenager that will make the difference. MALALA: l'm still 1 7. l'm still a teenager. What should l do? How can l help? REPORTER 4: Malala Yousafzai has joined the campaign to find Nigeria 's missing schoolgirls. REPORTER 5: Much-needed help arriving with 1 7-year-old Malala Yousafzai now in Nigeria... bringing with her worldwide attention.

(FAZLULLAH SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) MaIaIa Yousafzai targeted IsIam. So, we tried to kill her. GUGGENHEIM: Who was the person who shot Malala? It was not a person. It was an ideoIogy. MALALA: When l'm in a car, looking through the window... l like just to be silent for a while. Sometimes l feel that l am in England but it's just for a short time. l'm not going to live here forever. When l think of Swat, l think that it's just a story. lt's something that happened and l can never see Swat again. GUGGENHEIM: What would happen if you went back today? If I wouId go back, wouId I be shot? Of course I wouId be. They said, ''If you come back we're going to shoot you.'' l just want to go once just to see that house. Just once. Just look at it. AtaI.

GUGGENHEIM: lf there's a boy you like... why can't you pick up the phone and ask him, ''Let's go to a movie''? (LAUGHS ) No, it wouId be quite embarrassing. And the other thing is that if my famiIy wouId know, it wouId be a surprise for them. And they wouId be astonished. ''MaIaIa asked a boy?'' And there is Roger Federer. -GUGGENHEIM: You Iike him? -Yeah. GUGGENHEIM: You Iike tennis or you Iike his haircut? (LAUGHS ) I Iike his haircut. MALALA: It's aIways changing. One of my friends, the Taliban stopped their car... and showed them the head of a slaughtered man. They said, ''lf you don't follow the real lslam ''that we're showing you... ''then you can be the next person like this man. '' They were not about faith. They were about power. ZIAUDDIN: They are cruel people who are misusing the name of lslam. They are the enemies of lslam. They used to bring innocent people to the square... sometimes shoot them in the square and sometimes slaughter them in the square. They used to leave a note on the body... ''lf you go against the Taliban, ''this could be you tomorrow. '' Many people, they thought that if they speak... they will be killed the very next day. I was feeIing that if I don't speak, I wouId be the most sinfuI and the most guiIty man in this worId. As a schoolboy, the hardest times... were the moments when a teacher asked me to stand and read a passage from a book. GUGGENHEIM: Tell me about your father's stammer. When he taIks? Yeah. Mmm. (STAMMERS ) MaIaIa. MaIaIa. MALALA: One thing that l noticed in my father... even if he stammers for one minute, he will try to say that word. He never stops. The first time you can just stop it. And you can say another word instead. But my father never does that. ZIAUDDIN: My father was a very passionate and emotional speaker. A fiery speaker. The most eloquent man l have ever seen in my life. He used to give sermons in the mosque every Friday. My father would be shouting and speaking like just bringing out fires. l asked my father, ''Can you write a speech for me?'' ''Oh, look. You utter one sentence in a minute. ''You stutter, stutter, stammer, stammer. ''How will you speak to public?'' My name was announced, l went to the podium... l was speaking to the people but l did not see them. And when l ended my speech, one of my teachers came to me and told... ''Oh, Ziauddin, you spread the fire. '' l got encouraged. l didn't keep silent. l spoke. Because this is me. (SNIFFLES ) Because this is me. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) IsIam is our reIigion. IsIam is our reIigion. They tarnished the beautifuI face of IsIam.

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) If my rights are vioIated and I keep siIent, I shouId better die than to Iive. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) MALALA: l would worry about my father. Some of his friends were attacked and some of his friends were killed. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ZIAUDDIN: The Taliban leader announced my name on his FM radio. l used to change my routine. l used to keep a random kind of schedule. MALALA: lt was really hard to sleep. l could see a lot of scary things. Usually, the Taliban killed people at nighttime. l would go outside... l would check every door. ''That gate is closed, so they cannot come from that gate. '' ''That door is locked, so they cannot come from that door. '' ''Oh, God, protect my father. ''Protect our family. '' DIANE SAWYER: The Nobel Peace Prize, the average age of the winner is 62. But tonight, the youngest nominee is a 16-year-old girl. (WHIRRING) (ALL SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Bring the breakfast. Dad, we are getting Iate for schooI. INTERPRETER: Malala is the daughter of the nation. She is doing great work for the girls' education. She's Iike a roIe modeI to all our girIs. AMANPOUR: She's even a favorite now to win the Nobel Peace Prize. MALALA: Nobel Peace Prize, if l get it, it would be an honor for me. It wouId heIp me in my campaign for girIs' education. INTERPRETER 1: Malala is a brave, intelligent girl from our valley. She lit the candle of knowledge in our country. INTERPRETER 2: Malala was a girl like us. She's inspiring us. One of the most important factors for HitIer... She's a goodwill ambassador of Pakistan and we're definiteIy supporting her. KATE SNOW: ln her hometown today, schoolchildren prayed she would win the Nobel. Good morning, Iadies and gentIemen. The Norwegian NobeI Committee has decided... that the NobeI Peace Prize for 2013... is to be awarded to the Organization for the Prohibition of ChemicaI Weapons. ZIAUDDIN: They must have made a decision on merit... so we shouId honor it, we shouId accept it, and we shouId be happy for that. MALALA: Awards doesn't matter. PeopIe have supported me, and that is the greatest award I have deserved. GUGGENHEIM: If awards don't matter, what matters? Really, change matters. Change matters. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Destroying a schooI is not a difficuIt job. It's quite easy to torch. And God's full support is there. MALALA: The Taliban started the campaign that girIs' education is against IsIam... and girIs shouId not go to schooI. (FAZLULLAH CONTINUES SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) As Iong as girIs are covered, they can get reIigious education. Any other type of education is compIeteIy unnecessary for women. ZIAUDDIN: Education was a threat to them. Education gives you the power to question things. The power to challenge things. To be independent. (INDISTINCT TALKING ON TABLET) Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, as well. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, as well. MALALA: We have given scholarships to many girls all around the world. I am very happy that you go to schooI and study. Put a Iot of effort in your studies, okay? And when the teacher gives you homework, make sure you do it on time, okay? Yes. MALALA: Little girls. They're only six and seven... who'll be going to other people's houses to clean their houses. And now these girls are getting education. (INDISTINCT TALKING ON TABLET) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) ZIAUDDIN: lt's very difficult to forget all those good days. When l was facing those girls... it was lovely. l dream that one day l'll go back... and l will meet all my students, my people. That would be the greatest day, the happiest day of my life. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) There will be no end to this, God willing. ZIAUDDIN: Three schools bombed in Matta. Two more schools in Charbagh. One more school in Kabal. MALALA: When they came to our town, they bombed three schools in one night. lt brought fear. lt scared children. They thought that if they go to school they might be killed. ZIAUDDIN: Many international journalists used to go from person to person. Everybody said, ''No, l can't speak. ''l can't risk my life. '' The BBC correspondent said... ''We need someone to write a diary of Swat. '' MALALA: The first girl told her whole story, what happened on her day. The next day, her father came to school and told my father... ''My daughter cannot do this. ''l do not want her to be killed. '' My father asked me, ''Would you like to?'' My mother would say, ''lt's written in the holy Qur'an... ''that truth has to come and falsehood has to die. '' Every night the BBC correspondent would call me... and l would tell him what my feelings are and what happened all the day. They changed my name and gave me a pseudonym, Gul Makai. GUGGENHEIM: So you moved houses? MALALA: This is, you can call it the fourth house. -GUGGENHEIM: Fourth? -Yeah. First, my mother, father, they were in a hosteI. Then they moved to an apartment. Then we went to another house. We stayed there maybe for six, seven months, and now we are here. GUGGENHEIM: What's your favorite book of all time? No, don't ask difficuIt questions. I Iike this book, A Brief History of Time, but it's quite difficuIt to understand. You have to read it three, four times. And then the book which is my favorite book, is The Alchemist. Over there, the yellow one. (LAUGHS ) So, there's another book, it's quite... Show me the book. What is it? Here's another book. It's quite boring. So this is l Am Malala. Written by MaIaIa with Christina Lamb. And someone has given me an autograph. Someone has signed it. And her name is aIso MaIaIa. ''Dear MaIaIa, well done, keep it up. ''Best of Iuck, MaIaIa.'' FEMALE REPORTER: Private schools in Pakistan are banning a book written by Malala Yousafzai. MALE REPORTER: The school board president said Malala represented the views of the West. There are many other peopIe who are doing much more for the Pakistani community. That's a big question for us. Why she's getting so much attention. She's getting a Iot of fame and I think it's more of a pubIicity stunt. She shouId have stayed in Swat. She went to EngIand. MaIaIa is just name of a character. It can be anyone. She's a girI. She don't know anything. (MAN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Her father wrote everything for her. That's why she's so famous. GUGGENHEIM: l've noticed something about you. Yeah? GUGGENHEIM: You don't Iike to taIk about your suffering. (CHUCKLES ) GUGGENHEIM: You're avoiding the question. I am? You're avoiding my question. Of course I am. (LAUGHS ) GUGGENHEIM: You don't like to talk about it. (CHUCKLES ) Well, I don't know. Every night you would hear the noises of the bomb blasts. And in the morning, the school was no more there. They destroyed more than 400 schools. Finally, the Taliban became so strong... they could make a demand more devastating than their bombs. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) After January 15th, from the oIdest to the youngest ... ... not one singIe girI shouId go to schooI. MALALA: The Taliban said that no girl can go to school... and if she goes, then you know what we can do. The government decided to take military action against the Taliban. There was fighting everywhere. With millions of others, our family had to leave our beautiful Swat Valley. For three months, we moved from place to place. Refugees in our own country. What's his name? MaIik. There's no schooIs. Ranim used to go to schooI because she's six, but now they've destroyed the schooIs. MALALA: No matter where you go in the world... no matter what country, what religion... you will find children who are out of school. ln just three years, 3 million Syrian children are no longer in school. Each day, hundreds cross the border to escape war. (MALALA GREETS IN ARABIC) Peace be upon you. People argue about the war and debate about the politics... but who is thinking about the children? When we returned home we were hopeful. But those old, busy roads were vacant. Many houses and schools were destroyed. The Taliban were no more on the roads, but the target killing continued. Our beautiful school was used in the fighting. lt was school where l would see my friends every day. Where we would learn every day. lt was school which was giving me hope... which was building up my future. There is a moment when you have to choose... whether to be silent or to stand up. ZIAUDDIN: Sometimes some people just say that... one should protect his life... protect his family. MALALA: When l was little, many people would say... ''Change Malala 's name. ''lt's a bad name, it means sad. '' But my father would always say, ''No, it has another meaning. ''Bravery. '' ZIAUDDIN: The BBC blog, it was very safe. lt was anonymous. But it was not enough. MALALA: l knew what the risk would be, standing in front of the camera. He didn't push me. He let me do what l wanted. When every man was losing courage at the battlefield, a woman raised her voice. Speak, Malala. Speak from your heart. Speak what's inside your soul. (MALALA SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) Even if I have nowhere to sit, and have to sit on the fIoor to get an education, I will do that. You are not afraid of anyone? I am afraid of no one. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) Don't dare go forward. If you do, remember that you, and your home, will not be safe! (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) ZIAUDDIN: She was the first one who named them. The same FazIullah, who sIaughtered our brothers and beat our girIs with cIubs, why do you Iet him be? Why are Sufi Muhammad, MusIim Khan and FazIullah still free? MALALA: We started sneaking to the school. Going secretly. (FAZLULLAH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE ON SPEAKERS ) Remember, I know you! Listen carefully, when I am willing to kill myseIf, others are nothing to me. This is not just for MaIaIa Yousafzai, but it is in the name of those girIs who fight for their rights, raise their voice for their rights and have the passion to get educated. ZIAUDDIN: They'll never kill a child. l never, never expected that. MALALA: l have the right to sing. l have the right to go to market. l have the right to speak up. l will get my education if it is in home, school or any place. They cannot stop me. ZIAUDDIN: l was in a press club and it was my turn to speak. My friend received a call. ''Malala 's school bus has been attacked. '' She was taken to a military hospital. The doctors performed an emergency surgery. There were a lot of people in the hospital. Nobody thought that she will survive. Me and my wife, we cried all the night. REPORTER 1: The doctors made the decision to move her. REPORTER 2: The plane that she's in now, provided by the United Arab Emirates... is a special air ambulance... DR. REYNOLDS: lt wasn't certain that she could survive. DR. ROSSER: A large piece of bone was removed when her brain started swelling. DR. REYNOLDS: Although she was on very strong antibiotics, she had some infection. DR. KAYANI: Sepsis has got a very high mortality rate. DR. ROSSER: The procedure she will be undergoing in the next week... is putting a titanium plate over the deficit in her skull. DR. REYNOLDS: Malala 's kidneys had started to shut down. Her blood acid levels had started to rise. Her blood had stopped clotting properly. DR. ROSSER: Malala is still showing some signs of infection. She has undergone a further surgical procedure to repair her left facial nerve. DR. REYNOLDS: She wasn't moving her right side well. That area of the brain was still not working properly. DR. ROSSER: The second part of the procedure she'll be undergoing a cochlear implant. DR. REYNOLDS: l was very worried that survival would be with major disabilities. When she first woke up, she didn't believe that her father was alive. She had got it into her head that he'd been targeted and he was dead. Every time l saw her she asked me, ''So where's my father?'' ZIAUDDIN: We were thinking, ''What Malala will be thinking?'' ''l was a child. You should have stopped me. ''What has happened to me is because of you. '' The doctors told me, ''She will survive. '' But would she recover? And... ZIAUDDIN: Like this. Good. There was still a fear that she may not be the same as she was. Would she be able to walk? Would she be able to talk? Okay. (THERAPIST SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) ZIAUDDIN: Would she be able to speak as she used to speak? With the same spirit? GORDON BROWN: lt is a miracle that you are here with us today. You had to overcome an attempt on your life. Grievous injuries inflicted by a gun. Months in hospital. You have been taken from your own country that you love. Let me say the words the TaIiban never wanted her to hear... Happy 16th birthday, MaIaIa. (ALL APPLAUDING) It is an honor for me to be speaking again after a Iong time. Thank you to every person who has prayed for my fast recovery... and a new Iife. The TaIiban shot me on the Ieft side of my forehead. They shot my friends, too. They thought that the bullet wouId siIence us. But nothing changed except this: Weakness, fear and hopeIessness died. Strength, power and courage was born. I am the same MaIaIa. My ambitions are the same. My hopes are the same and my dreams are the same. We realize the importance of light when we see darkness. We realize the importance of our voice when we are silenced. We beIieve in the power and the strength of our words. Today is the day of every woman... every boy and every girl... who has raised their voice for their rights. Let us pick up our books and our pens. They are our most powerful weapons. One chiId, one teacher... one book and one pen can change the worId. (ALL CHEERING) l have been given a new life. And this life, this life is a sacred life. ATAL: One more game of Snap. (SING-SONG) Oh, yeah, I got some cards here! MALALA: Okay, so one... ALL: Two, three, go. ATAL: One, two, three, go! (TOOR SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MALALA: KhushaI, you're not taking the card. You're so sIow. One, two, three. -Oh! -(BOTH LAUGHING) I'm donkey? I'm your father. What are you saying? Your father's a donkey. KHUSHAL: No, it's just a game. MALALA: I didn't say it. GUGGENHEIM: MaIaIai, she made a choice. ''I might get shot but I'm gonna do it.'' But your father made the choice to pick this Iife for you. No. My father onIy gave me the name MaIaIai. He didn't make me MaIaIai. l chose this life. lt was not forced on me. lt was not told to me to live such kind of life. l chose this life and now l must continue it. THORBJORN JAGLAND: Ladies and gentlemen... good morning. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided... that the NobeI Peace Prize for 2014... is to be awarded to Malala Yousafzai... and Kailash Satyarthi. (BOTH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) JAGLAND: A conscience exists in the world... that extends beyond all boundaries. lt says that children have a right to childhood. MALALA: l tell my story not because it is unique... but because it is not. (ALL APPLAUDING) lt is the story of many girls. I am MaIaIa, but I'm aIso Shazia. l'm Kainat. l'm Kainat Soomro. l'm Mezon. l'm Amina. l am those 66 million girls who are deprived of education. l'm not a lone voice, l am many. And our voices have grown Iouder and Iouder. (MUSIC PLAYING)
