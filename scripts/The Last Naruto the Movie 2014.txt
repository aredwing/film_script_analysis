A certain person bit into the forbidden fruit, and obtained the power of chakra. and tried to end the age of violence. However, in time, They become obsessed with power, To maintain order in this world, does one need power or love? This conflict would spark a long war, that continued through into the generations that followed. Who are you and what are you doing here? Your eyes are creepy. I'll bet your actually a monster, right. Yeah, you Byakugan monster. Hey, stop! Hey, don't fight women. I am Uzumaki Naruto Fight me if you dare. Hey, what can you do kid? Go away. Kagebunshin Jutsu Boom.. Boom.. I'll beat you. So will I. Take this! I'll remind you not to join Pull on it. Cowards, that's all you can do. They've runied your scarf. Thanks can I keep it. If you want, its ruined now. Wait! Once again, thanks. See ya. If the world were to end tomorrow. who would you like to spend your last day with? Like that would happen. Just suppose the moon began to fall. If it's the end of the world, I wish meat would fall instead of the moon. You look very happy today ... That's because I've fallen in love with someone. Write down who you'd want to spend your last day on Earth with. Ah, no way If I could get out and become a true ninja. That is my dream Hey, Naruto Do not waste your paper, But it is unlikely the world will end, THE LAST: NARUTO THE MOVIE This is a celestial decree. A celestial decree upon the Hyuga clan. I will ask you one last time. Answer me, Hiashi Hyuga The answer, which will decide the future of your clan. This is the Hyuga's, reply. You fool. I'm going to demonstrate some moves. - Naruto Senpai. - Naruto Senpai. I never expected him to become such high stakes material - Did you just say steak? - High stakes. Popular with girls. His efforts in the war two years ago, turned him into the village hero. Yeah. Thank you very much. All right, eat up. - Thank you. - Thank you. Big brother Naruto, Hey, Konohamaru. I have something to show you. - What is it? - It's Grandfather Hiruzen's stuff. I found it during spring cleaning. Hey, is this. Don't you dare call them junk. They're really precious. - These are. - They're, not junk. I'm Naruto Uzamaki. Time sure flies. RINNE FESTIVAL Sales for the Rinne Festival have already started. Naruto Senpai. Huh. Please accept my Rinne Festival present. Huh. For me? I'm always cheering for you. I made it myself. - Please accept it. - Please accept it. H-Hey, thanks. Thank you. Hinata. Oh, Sakura. Hmm. Knitting something? That's a surprise. I'm making a scarf. Hmm. W-What is it? Give it your all okay. Huh. It's a present for him, right? He's been really popular, lately. Oh, really. They even come all the way from other villages just to take pictures of him. Oh. Don't say "Oh." Hurry up and finish that scarf. O-Okay. Come on. Have more confidence. Be Bold. O-Okay. It looks a little big. All done. I put my heart and soul into it. I'm sure my feelings will reach Naruto. But will they? It's already late. Maybe tomorrow's better. Nope, I'll give it to him tonight. Maybe tomorrow. No, Tonight. No, Tomorrow's. Just hurry up and tell him how you feel. Hanabi. Why didn't you say you were here? Watching a girl agonize over love is fun. That's no way for a child to talk. I'm not a child. My Byakugan's perception is as good as any grown-up. Anyway, Look. Isn't it cute? Treating your Kunai like a toy again. He'll burst out laughing if your tummy growls while you're confessing your love. I'm not going to confess anything. Rather than giving him a scarf, maybe you should make yourself look more fashionable. The moon is falling. The moon is clearly getting closer to Earth. Is that why there have been more meteorites lately? I'll explain. As two celestial bodies get closer to each other, Their gravity will begin to pull. Once a certain distance is reached, the moon's surface will begin to break apart. I believe a part of the surface has begun to fall to Earth. And what will happen? The moon will completely disintegrate. And its fragments will rain over the Earth's surface. If nothing is done, mankind will. Parish. Is this a natural phenomenon? Or is this a man-made assault? Thats a good question. It's getting to be the season when ramen really hits the spot. You only eat ramen all year long. You really like ramen, don't you? Yup, I love it. Five more orders of gyoza. - Coming right up. - Five orders? I can't eat that much. Then don't have any. Time to dig in. Can't get this dirty. Hey, that scarf. Oh, Hinata. Join us if you haven't eaten. It's on me tonight. He said something made him happy and he wants to celebrate. B-But. Don't be shy. Come and sit here. Join us, Hinata. O-Okay. Naruto Senpai. Hey, it's you guys. Thanks for the presents the other day. Order whatever you want. It's my treat. My thanks for the presents. - Thank you so much. - Thank you so much. Hinata, order what you want too. - Over here, Senpai. - Huh. Let's eat together. Hinata. What's wrong? I'm sorry. Actually, I'm quite full. - Huh. - Hinata. Why don't you walk her home? Walk Hinata home. Why? Well. - You can't let a young girl - Order up. Gyoza. - Walk home alone at night. - Thank you. Huh. Hinata's really strong. No one in the village would dare mess with her. Hey. Hinata. - Oh, you're such an idiot. - Huh. Why'd you call me an idiot? Senpai, the gyoza are ready. Let's eat. He can be so dense. You were going to give him the scarf weren't you? Uh-huh. You can do it, Hinata, Be confident. Thanks. But how come you're encouraging me so much? Huh, well. We need to support each other. Support each other. Who's there? That's Hanabi. Super Beast scroll. Naruto. I've always gazed at your back. But form now on, I want to always, always stand by your side. So I knitted this with all my heart. Please, accept my feelings. All right. One more time. Naruto. Hinata. Good evening. - We saw each other earlier at Ichiraku. - Oh, that's right. What's the matter? Th-That's a nice scarf, Oh, yeah. Hey, sounds like you're hungry. If you don't mind instant ramen, I have some in my room. Good Night. Huh. Didn't you want to talk to me? Hey, Hinata. I wonder who gave it to him. I'm happy for you, Naruto. Why are you crying? You're getting the scarf wet. I don't need it anymore. Then I'll take it. Who are you? I'm Toneri. I've come for you. Come for me. - Hinata. - What, Let me go. Hey you. What are you doing to Hinata? Multi-Shadow Clone jutsu. Hinata. Rasen Shuriken. Why you? Let Hinata go. Hold it. Hinata. Are you okay? Uh-huh. Rasengan. My body is going numb. My strength. Hinata. Your scarf's ruined. Yes. Where'd those shinobi come from? I don't know. The final day is approching. Before that. You Bastard. Before that day, I will come for you. Hinata. What is that? W-What's going on? The Earth. ... will be destroyed soon. Your mission is to, rescue Hanabi Hyuga who has been kidnapped. You'll be working as a 4-man team led by Shikamaru. I'm also granting Hinata's wish to be included on this team. Thank you very much. Shikamaru, put your hand out. Huh. Why? What's this? A top secret clock that only the Five Kage possess. What kind of clock is it? It's counting down the time until Earth's destruction. I don't get it. Why's this necessary for Hanabi's rescue? Toneri, the one who kidnapped Hanabi, Could be the one manipulating the moon. What are you basing this on? It's just a hunch. It was around here that I lost sight of Hanabi's kidnapper. Let's split up and search for clues. Naruto, take care of Hinata. Leave it to me. What is it? Oh, nothing. - Oh. - What is it? It's Hanabi's kunai. Huh. You brought the scarf? Huh. Why aren't you using it? Aren't you cold? I-I'm fine. Anyways, we'd better hurry and let Shikamaru and the others know. Oh yeah, you're right. What do you see, Hinata? There's a spring that's glowing at the bottom of the cave. A spring that's glowing. That Shinobi letter is "A" as in Aun. It could mean "This is the beginning." Hinata, what can you see at the bottom of the spring? My vision is distorted. Your Byakugan is distorting. We'll just have to go down and see. Whoa, I can't get this wet. You're so particular. What's the big deal if your scarf gets wet? It's a big deal. This means a lot to me. Huh. There's no need to worry. I touched this water and I didn't get wet. If the world were to end tomorrow. who would you like to spend your last day with? Like that would happen. Just suppose the moon began to fall. If it's the end of the world, I wish meat would fall instead of the moon. Look. The moon. Huh. The match-up for round 7. Naruto Uzumaki versus. Kiba Inuzuka. This is the Chunin Exam. Naruto. Don't you dare lose to a guy like him. -Ninja Art, Beast Mimicry. -All-fours jutsu. -Wait a minute. Here I come. Stop it, Kiba. Naruto is fighting pain right now. Naruto is fighting alone. Universal Pull. Naruto. Naruto. What is it? It's ointment. Why're you giving it to me? Just accept it, Naruto. Thanks, you're nice. Hinata. You're about to die, Why'd you come out here? You're no match. This time. I'm going to save you, Naruto. I was always crying, and giving up before even trying. I made so many wrong turns. But you helped me find my way and take the correct path, Naruto. I always chased after you. I wanted to catch up to you. I wanted to walk beside you all the time. I want to be at your side, always, You changed me, Naruto. Your smile is what saved me. That's why I'm not afraid to die. If it means I can protect you. Because, I love you, Naruto. Hinata. If the world were to end tomorrow. who would you like to spend your last day with? If it's the end of the world, I wish meat would fall instead of the moon. Not Iruka Sensei again. Write down who you'd want to spend your last day on Earth with. Hey, Naruto. Don't throw out your paper. But there's no way the world's gonna end. I'm just saying "if" it does. Well, it ain't gonna happen. NARUTO UZUMAKI Huh. Me. Naruto. What is it? It's ointment. Why're you giving it to me? - So dense. - Huh. He can be so dense. You were going to give him the scarf, weren't you? Uh-Huh. You can do it, Hinata. Be confident. Thanks. Naruto. I. You really like ramen, don't you? Yup, I love it. Naruto. I. You really like. Yup, I love Hinata. He's so dense. Maybe he doesn't know what love is. What do you mean? Like knowing the difference between loving sweets like shiratama dumplings and fruit gelatin, And romantic love. Huh, They're not the same? Oh. Hinata. Oh, you're such an idiot. Huh. Why'd you call me an idiot? Senpai, the gyoza are ready. - Hinata. - Oh. Senpai. Hinata. NARUTO UZUMAKI Hinata. That's why I'm not afraid to die. If it means I can protect you. Because, I love you, Naruto. Hinata. Naruto. Wake up. This is a dream. Oh, Sakura. You're finally awake. Huh. Is this a trap set by the enemy? Yeah. It traps intruders in a Genjutsu and shuts them away in a world of memories. It's a prison of caged memories. Thanks goodness Sakura who's resistant to Genjutsu was with us. Thanks, Sakura. I was having a fun dream with my bug brother in it. I appreciate you breaking it apart for me. That doesn't sound like gratitude. Another spring. Your Byakugan doesn't work here either. No, my field of sight is distorted. All right, be ready to fight as we proceed. - Roger. - Roger. What's the matter? About those Genjutsu dreams earlier. Huh. What is it? No. Never mind. Hinata. I said I'd come for you. To have you come to me. Where is Hanabi? Don't worry. She's fast asleep in my castle. Return Hanabi. That will all depend on your answer. Byakugan Princess. Byakugan Princess. Hinata. Let us be married. Huh. Be married? It's like a bubble factory. I get it. Huh. This is where the gatekeeper who made the bubbles lives. Gatekeeper. Naruto and Hinata are late. Should we go back to check? A-A crab. That's the Gatekeeper. Hinata. Naruto. Don't get near Hinata. You again. You're in the way, Move. Where is Hanabi? Scatter. Don't destroy the bubbles or we'll get caught in a Genjutsu again. Super Beast Scroll. Fujin. Raijin. Damn it. Shadow Stitching. Sakura. Cha. Damn it. You're a puppet? This is not my body. Hinata. Next time, the real me will come for you. Give me an answer then. Shut up. Your fists, will never reach me. Never. Did your punch do this Sakura? Oh yeah. Naruto, if you leave Hinata behind and expose het to danger again, You'll get a taste of my fists too. I know. Hinata, I'll never let you . . . . I'll never let you out of my sight again. What. You've already looking away. Huh. I'm not looking away. What is this place? Is that island floating? No. The surface of the ocean is warped. There's sunlight underground too. Isn't that a fake? A man made sun? Yeah. Hinata, any sign of the enemy? No, we're good. The enemy is aware of us. Why aren't they attacking? Yeah, that bothers me. It's too quiet. Leave them. Don't do anything until I go to get her. Oh. The eyes are twitching again. Amazing. This Byakugan is very pure. So patient. I'm sorry. I see a town about 20Kms ahead. All right, let's go. There's no one here. This town was built a few centuries ago. Let's split up and search. So it's a Shinobi village. A fire? What is this? Was there a war long ago? What's wrong, Hinata? It's a spider web. You can see far with your Byakugan, but you walk straight into a spider web. You're so silly. Naruto. What is it? Umm, What happened to your scarf? Oh. It's warm underground, so I took it off. I-I see. I feel a bit cold. I'll bet you are, dressed like that. It's just that, this is my mission gear. If you can take it. I can handle a little cold like this. Are you okay? I'm totally fine. What. Its nothing. What is it? I said it's nothing. Tell me. That was so good. Are you going somewhere? I'm gonna take a leak. Naruto. A spider web. You okay? Yeah. Ow. What's wrong? I think I hurt my back. Here you go. Thanks. Oh yeah. You gave me some ointment back during the Chunin exams. You remembered all this time. Actually, I-I just remembered. Thanks. We have to hurry and rescue hanabi. Naruto, I'd like to talk to you about something. What is it? About what you said when that puppet Toneri appeared. Toneri. Here they are. Hinata, we need you to cgeck something. What's it say? It's some ancient writing. Ancient oath. Crossing the path of humanity Like all else The fist of the Tensei Eye the reborn moon, will destroy man. What does that mean? Maybe the "Tensei Eye" is making the moon move. So Kakashi Sensei was right. Hanabi's abduction and the moon are somehow connected. Well, his hunches are always on target unfortunately. Byakugan Princess. What's that? Is this a burial site? What's this? Someone's here. The Byakugan. I sense the Byakugan. Oh, I'm certain of it. Oh, Byakugan princess. Stay away from Hinata. Hinata. What did you do to Hinata? The Tenseigan has been revived. It must be stopped. Otsutsuki. Hinata, are you all right? Uh-Huh. The man said something like Otsutsuki. That's the orginal surname of the Sage of Six Paths. Hagoromo Otsutsuki. That was the name of the Sage of Six Paths before he entered the priesthood. And he called Hinata the Byakugan princess. Seems Toneri's abduction of Hanabi is connected. Knitting. Is she going to keep knitting forever? I guess it takes a lot of time. Hinata, what was it that you wanted to talk about earlier? You mentioned something about what Toneri's puppet said? Oh, that. It was nothing. Huh. What do you mean nothing? I'm sorry, I want to be alone. I see. Let's check out that village. Seems like Hanabi's not here anymore. We should head back and rejoin the others. Uh-huh. Hinata. My younger sister is in so much danger. And here I am knitting. I'm a terrible big sister, aren't I? That's not true. You've come all this way just to save your sister. If only I'd stayed home then Don't worry. I swear I'll rescue Hanabi. Thank you. You're so kind, Naruto. Hey, I'm not just being kind because I love you or anything. I'm just worried about Hanabi. - What did you just say? - Huh? Did I say something? Oh yeah, I forgot. . . Hinata. I love you. Hinata. Toneri. Are you another puppet? Where is Hanabi? Silence. I came to hear Hinata's answer. Answers? Hinata has nothing to say to you. So where's Hanabi? Hinata. Hey. Hinata. What's going on? Goodbye, Naruto. Hinata. Give Hinata back. Give her back? Hinata came to me willingly. This has been destined since ancient times. Hinata and I shall be wed. Wed. Hinata. That's a lie, right? My Chakra is . . What are you doing? I don't want to get into a petty fight and risk getting you hurt. Hinata. Hurry up and go, I can't go any further. Hey. Stay in line. Don't panic. The air raid shelter was constructed. To accommodate every citizen in the Land of Fire. Keep calm. Please keep calm. Water Style. Water Dragon jutsu. Lava Style. Lava Monster jutsu. Particle Style. Atomic Dismantling jutsu. Damn it. My Back. So this was the moon. Yeah. The space where we found the crab's bubbles. is probably the passageway that connects the Earth to the moon. How is Naruto doing? Terrible. Most of his Chakra's been sucked out. Hinata. So you finally get it, you blockhead. So beautiful. Hinata. I want to know more about you. Why is he? Where am i? This is, Toneris's castle. Hanabi. Hanabi's eyes have been taken. Hinata. Hinata, Let us be married. Huh. Married? What are you saying? Let Hanabi. Your sister is in my castle. Hanabi. I've taken her Byakugan. You're terrible. I'm sorry. It's due to Hamura's Celestial Decree. Hamura? Hamura Otsutsuki. The founder of the Shinobi of the moon. Perhaps, it's easier to understand if I say he's the youngest brother of the Sage of Six Paths, founder of the Shinobi of Earth. Your Hyuga Clan inherited Hamura's blood. The story goes back many eons. Several millennia, in fact. The Sage of the Six Paths, the elder one, had misgivings. He feared that the Ten Tails with its massive chakra and immeasurable power would bring calamity to the world. So the Sage of Six Paths extracted the Ten Tails' chakra and divided it among nine Tailed Beasts in order to weaken its power. The husk of the Ten Tails whose chakra was extracted, namely the Gedo Statue, was hidden away and sealed on the moon. so that Ten Tails would never be revived. Hamura decided to live on the moon In order to guard the Gedo Statue. The Sage of Six Paths became the founder of the Shinobi on Earth. But Hamura was skeptical of the world. His elder brother was creating. So if the world created by his brother went astray from the Shinobi way. he entrusted his descendants with its destruction. Through the Millennia that have passed. fighting between Shinobi has not ceased. They continue to use chakra as a weapon. Ultimately, the Gedo Statue was stolen. and even the Ten Tails was revived. Our clan has reached the conclusion that Shinobi of Earth will destroy the world's peace and order. The world that the Sage of Six Paths created is a failure. So in accordance with the Celestial Decree of Hamura, I will destroy the world of the Sage of Six Paths. When this pure Byakugan synergizes with my chakra. It will transform into the Tenseigan. With its Visual Prowess, I will pick up the ashes of Earth and create a brand new world. I don't believe your story. And I'm going to rescue Hanabi. Even when you don't know where this castle is located? I'll return for your answer. Hinata. Good morning. I'm happy you understand how I feel, Hinata. Lady Hinata, welcome to the castle. - Welcome. - Welcome. There are only puppets in this castle. They're marionettes left here by our ancestors. Since my father died when I was young, I've lived in the castle all by myself. We will hold the marriage ceremony here. Then we will enter the Room of Rebirth. and fall into a deep slumber Until the Earth's environment stabilizes after its destruction. That's impossible. The moon will also be destroyed. Don't worry, The castle is protected by a stong chakra. Is that Chakra as strong as it was? Yes. Strong enough to move the moon. What do you mean? It's the power of Otsutsuki's treasurs honed from the sufferings of my clan. Where would such a thing be? That is something. I cannot tell you. May I return to my room? It's cold outside. That's because it's dusk here all year. Oh, that's right. Will you knit me a scarf? Huh. A scarf just for me. Do you refuse? I understand. Really, Thank you. You've make me happy, Hinata. What's wrong? Don't worry. It's proof that the Byakugan is maturing into the Tenseigan. It will subside with a little rest. It doesn't seem to be here. Byakugan Princess. Tenseigan, activate. We are descendants of Hamura. We belong to the main family of Otsutsuki Clan. We were annihilated by the branch family, who has twisted the interpretation of Hamura's Celestial Decree. Toneri, a descendant of the branch family, is attempting to make the moon fall into the Earth by using the power of the Tenseigan. Only you can destroy the Tenseigan, Byakugan Princess. You are, Hamura Otsutsuki. Byakugan Princess. Do not let the world my elder brother created come to an end. Hanabi, you poor thing. I'll definitely find and destroy. The Tenseigan. Imagine that. Toneri has been hiding in the artificial sun. Why wasn't Hinata's Byakugan able to discover it? Maybe he has a jutsu on the artificial moon that deflects the Byakugan too? Where's the entrance? Why don't we ask them? What are you doing? You've alerted the enemy. Follow me. What are you doing? I'll explain later. So is that how it is. Sai, retreat. Super Beast Scroll. I never imagined that his turn to appear would come after the war, When the world was peaceful. Beneath is the chakra Diffusion Cannon. We'll blast all the meteorites above the Equator. On top is the chakra Transportation Cannon. It can transport any target into another dimension. With these, we'll destroy the moon. Everyone, get the cannons ready immediately. Meals are nice when you have someone to talk to. Now tell me all about yourself. It's not too late to negotiate with the Shinobi of earth. What. You're right. The Shinobi of Earth have used Chakra and continued fighting. But it's different now. In order to protect this hard-fought peace. Shinobi have joined together. So, They will start another war. The Sage of Six Paths' world must be destroyed. But. Never bring up that subject again. Now be quiet and eat. That Island. So it's appeared already. That is the temple of the Hamura. Once a year, during the Rebirth Festival it comes near the castle. I'm sure of it. The Tenseigan is hidden on that island. Good-bye, Naruto. Hinata. Hinata. You're finally awake. Finally. It's been three days. Huh. Did something happen between you and Hinata? No, not really. You keep groaning her name, Hinata, Hinata. As well as some other embarrassing things. But I got to listen in on your mushy side. It was great research material for me. Come on. Naruto. Let's go rescue Hinata and Hanabi. Is it hard to see the woman who dumped you? So Naruto's strong as a Shinobi but he can't handle a broken heart. Now I know your weakness. Hey. Hamura must be happy that you personally want to pay homage. The Tenseigan is inside here. This is. The Tenseigan. Then this is Otsutsuki's Treasure that is moving the moon? Lady Hinata, only those in exalted positions are allowed to see the real Tenseigan. This is a temple where others of lower rank come to pray. I see. I shall show you the real Tenseigan after we are married. My field of vision is distorted only at that spot. I see. I get it. How long are you going to be like that? You gave up on a woman. So why not give up on becoming a Hokage too? Yeah, Give it up. Give up on the woman as well as becoming Hokage. What. Shikhamaru. Are you picking a fight? I don't care what happens between you and Hinata. But you're a Shinobi. Come with me. I'm going to my room to rest. I'm looking forward to the finished scarf. I feel it. I can feel it. The beating in my eyes. It will be born very soon. The complete Tenseigan. Sakura. It's the result of infusing nearly every ounce of her chakra into you. So that she could prevent you from dying. Sakura. Naruto. Sakura, I'm so sorry. Are you going to depend on Sakura to heal not only his body, but his heart as well? Can you do it? You have a point. I see. I never thought you'd confess your love first. Remember long ago, when you said you loved me? But, wasn't that because I loved Sasuke? You didn't want to lose to him. It's real this time, Isn't it? Hinata is a great person. She's almost too good for you. But it's over. Hinata went to Toneri. You are so stupid. It's obvious she had a reason that she couldn't reveal. When a girl truly fall in love, her feelings don't change that easily. They can't change. I understand how she feels very well. This is. . the Tenseigan. I'll stop the moon. What's going on? You're wrong. What. Hamura's soul entrusted me with the true Celestial Decree. You have distorted Humura's teachings. Hamura never wished for the destruction of Earth. the Sage of Six Path's world. You've betrayed me. Please hear me out. Hamura is. Silence. They're lies. I don't believe it. There is only one Celestial Decree that Hamura made. That is to end the world of the Sage of Six Paths. Damn it. So you were knitting this. for him and not me? I'm going to make it so. You'll never betray me again. Hinata. This big idiot finally understands. The meaning of the scarf you gave me when you went to Toneri. I know now, from the scarf you painstakingly knitted and took so long to finish that your love can't be unraveled so easily. Naruto. Wait for me. You've loved someone like me forever and ever. Now, as a man, there's something I've got to say to you. Hinata, I swear I'll save you. Lord Raikage, the Chakra cannons are ready. All right. Men. Load the chakra. - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. First, we'll fire the chakra Diffusion Cannon to pulverize the meteorites. Pulverize. Powderize. I need assistance. You got it. Rasen Shuriken. Shadow Paralysis jutsu. Next. We're storming the citadel. Right. Sakura. Thanks, Naruto. No need to thank me. I have a debt to you that I'll bever be able to repay. What a drag. Why hide it? It's irritating, and prevents me from making wise decisions. Naruto. Can you sense Hanabi's chakra? Hanabi is in that tower over there. Sakura, Sai. Take care of Hanabi. - Right. - Right. Hinata. You bastard. Your fists will never reach me. Naruto. Where's Hinata? In there. I'll handle things here. Thanks. Move. Whoa, I won't let you pass. All right, the puppet show begins now. Hanabi is above here. What. This way. Hinata. Wind Style. Sky Sand Defensive Wall. At six o'clock. It's a huge one. Everyone. Crane Wing Formation. - Roger. - Roger. The Sixth Gate Of Joy. Damn it. You're. If he's not around. The only one who can protect the village is me. Sasuke. The meteorites are gone. Lord Hokage. What is it? Hiashi. Chakra capacity at 75%. 76. 77. One after the other. Go in. Hinata. What did you do? Give Hinata back. Fine. I shall give her back to you. Stop, Hinata. What do you think of my wife's skils? Damn it. He's controlling her. Hinata. Bear with it for just a while. Don't you dare manipulate Hinata. Hinata belongs to me. I'm taking her back. Hinata. Be gone. Bastard. It's too early to wake up. Damn. The final pulsation. Naruto. Hinata. I'm so sorry, Naruto. I. I understand, so don't say anything. I'm the one who has to apologize. But what about him? Now's our chance. We have to destroy the Tenseigan. Tenseigan? Hanabi. How terrible. She's just a child. Hinata. If we destroy this, the moon should stop its approach. No. There is a cursed jutsu cast upon this eye. Only someone with Hamura's Blood can touch it. Anyone else will get their chakra extracted. What. Eight Trigrams Twin Lion Surging Shot. I can't destroy it. Hinata. Infuse me with your chakra. Huh. Then we might be able to break it apart. Okay. Let's go. Okay. These are. The Tenseigan was a cluster of Byakugan? What. Lord Hokage. The Moon had stopped its approach. What. Chakra capacity is 95%. 96. 97. 98. 99 Chakra is at 100%. Chakra Diffusion Cannon Fire. Yeah. What just happened? An urgent message from the Cloud Village. A Five Kage Summit is being convened. All the meteorites have been destroyed. So you had such a weapon like that hidden away? It seems we cannot be too careful with you, Raikage. Lord Tsuchikage, let's forget the sarcasm. Next up is the chakra Transportation Cannon. We'll blow up the moon. Blow up the moon. What's happening? Shikamaru. Hinata. Are you all right? Yes, I'm sorry. Save that for later. Anyway, what happened? The artificial sun disappeared. We destroyed the Tenseigan. It was the source of power for everything. The moon should have stopped moving too. What. The treasure that my entire clan offered their eyes to. The Otsutsuki treasure. How dare they. Hanabi. Thank you. This is yours, right? Uh-huh. Isn't that the scarf that Toneri ripped off? How did you know? When I pulled Toneri's jutsu from your body. I was able to see your memories. You were going to give it to Naruto, right? Did you make it for me? U-Uh-huh. Can I have it? But, it's in shreds. I don't care. I mean. I want it. Thank you. I'll cherish it. Naruto. What's the matter? The Clock. It's moving. - Huh. - Huh. With these eyes, Naruto. I'll destroy your world. It's too dangerous to blow up the moon. As long as there's a bomb called the moon, the Earth will not be safe. Now, let's discuss this calmly. Right now, the moon has stopped its approach. No. It hasn't stopped. What. Why is the clock ticking again? I don't know. W-What was that? Kurama. Kurama. It's Toneri. Chakra capacity at 90%. Lord Hokage. Hiashi would like a word with you. Hiashi. Do not destroy the moon. I'm certain that Hanabi and Hinata are on the moon. What do you mean by that? Bad news. What is it? The Nine Tails is on the moon's surface. What. Chakra capacity at 95%. Lord Raikage. An urgent message from Lord Hokage. What does he want at a critical time? Please hold the chakra Cannon. Naruto and the others are on the moon. It can't be helped. They have to be sacrificed for the sake of humanity and the Earth. We're going to fire the chakra Transportation Cannon. - Lord Raikage. - What is it? I'm asking you too. Wait one hour. What. I agree. Mizukage. Naruto is the hero of the last Great War. He's worth betting on. Tsuchikage. Just one hour will do. But for them, that amount of time will be worth a lifetime that can never be replaced. What do you base that on? A Hunch. Hinata, are you okay? Uh-huh. No. I'm taking Hinata back. You can watch his last moments from there. Hinata. Naruto. The world created by the Sage of Six Paths is a failure. I'm destroying both the Earth and you. I won't let the Earth get destroyed. Rasen-Rampage. Golden Wheel Rebirth Explosion. Naruto. What is that? The moon. The moon has split apart. What. What's happening? Hey, Hokage. There's ten minutes left. Massive Rasengan. Barrage. It's useless. Give it up. Like I'd give up. It takes time to knit a scarf. The deeper the feelings you want to convey. the longer it takes to knit. It's over now. Like I'd let you. To convey one's feelings. It takes much, much. more time. That's why I can't let it end, so easily. You got me with, one punch. The Tenseigan is fading. Huh. Hinata. Naruto. I'm taking back Hanabi's eyes. No, Stop. Why you? This is over. Not yet. Sakura, are you okay? What about Naruto and the others? I don't know. W-What's going on? I'll end it all with these eyes. Puppet Rebirth. You're annoying. Naruto. Hinata. Toneri, please stop already. All you did was follow your ancestor's misguided teachings. Quiet. As the last survivor of the Otsutsuki Clan, I must fulfill Hamura's Celestial Decree. Naruto. All my Chakra's being sucked out. You'll now feel the power of Hamura, one that can even move the moon. Naruto. It's over for you. Hinata? What? I won't let it end yet. Why? Hamura's chakra flows within me too. Stop already. End it. End the world of the Sage of Six Paths. I will destroy the Sage's world, that has fallen into darkness. with the light of justice. What. His jutsu absorbed the sun's energy. and now, he's passed his chakra limits. Naruto. Don't, It's too dangerous. Time's up. Fire the chakra Transportation Cannon. What's wrong? I can't shoot at Naruto. Stifle your personal feelings. The very existance of Earth depends on this. Move. I'll fire it. Lord Raikage. There is some writing on the moon. What. Kurama is writing something on the moon's surface. What. That Shinobi letter means mission accomplished. The mission was successful. I see. Emergency announcement to the entire world. The moon has stopped. Thanks to the efforts of these five. Shikamaru, Sakura, Sai, Hinata, and Naruto, Earth and the future of Earth is safe. My hunches usually end on a high note. Making me write letters. I'm bad at calligraphy. Sorry, Kurama. T-This is. Hamura's soul guided me here. Toneri, everyone on Earth will welcome you. I will remain on the moon and atone for my sins. Toneri. One day. One day. come to Earth. The moon will never approach Earth. Never again. Naruto, there's something I have to ask you. What is it? That scarf. Who gave it to you? Oh, this. My late mom made it for me. What. My grandpa must've kept it for her. Mom. I see. I'm so silly. Hey, Elder sister. How long are you going to chit chat? I'm going on ahead of you. Hurry up. The passageway is starting to disintegrate. Let's go home to Earth. Yes. Hinata. Yes. Back in school, when we were asked. who we'd want to spend our last day on Earth with? I couldn't write anyone's name down. I didn't know my parents, and I didn't have any friends. But now, I know exactly whom I'd choose. I want to stay with you. Now and forever, until I die. I want to be with you Hinata. Naruto. Naruto. Hinata, put your arms around me. Huh. O-Okay. Don't let go okay? I won't. I'll never, ever let go. Huh, What are you doing? Elder Sister. Naruto. You're going to crash into the ceiling. Like I'm going to let it stop here. Hinata. Naruto. Thank you, Hinata. Daddy. Daddy. Play with us. Hey, don't go outside in your bare feet. All right, Bolt, Himawari. How about a snowball fight. - A snowball fight. - A snowball fight. Take that. Hey, Bolt. All right, you asked for it. - Yay. - Yay. Hey, you know when Mom gets serious, she's super strong.
