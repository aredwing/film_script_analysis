Listen, Mort, I just heard on the radio that something happened down there at the Chinaman's. Sounded like a real bloodbath... people hollering and screaming all over the place. - Oh, my God. - What happened? I don't know. I didn't hear all the details. They had a reporter doing an on-the-spot number. Was it a tong war? I don't know, but the way he said it, there was about 25 squad cars there. There was some asshole that went up and just started shooting. Kids too. Who's the Chinaman, Mort? Downtown... a guy in import-export. - Did you know him? - Yeah. Yeah, Do you want a drink? Well, I'm sure you'll excuse me. - I have to meet someone over there. - Well, come back, okay? Nice seeing ya. Sorry about... you know. - That's okay. - But come back, okay? Good night, Alvinia. What's the matter? Don't you like him? - Oh, he's sweet. - He's a nice guy. He's a nice-lookin' guy. Is he a nice guy? Notice how upset he was about that Chinese massacre? - Will you excuse me, please? I have to freshen up. - Sure. How long were you and Mort married? - Listen... - I really don't remember. You don't remember? You were married to him, and you don't remember how long? - Don't worry about it. - No. So I gotta put up a chimney to carry the smoke out. Why can't the smoke go in the house? Hi, Mort. Flo, I gotta talk to you... alone. Screw. Have yourself a whistle. You, take off with him. Get her ready. - I'll be with you in a while. - Guess what. I got a message from Marty. - You see Marty? - I'm always looking at Marty. - Say hello to Marty. - Greatest guy in the world. - You know what he told me? - There he is. - That's him. - The two-finger salute. - It's all right, Marty. - You know what he just told me? Stopped by the table. - Yeah, what'd he tell ya? - He said the Chinaman is dead. The Chin... I thought you'd be happy. Now I'll give you something to cry about. You gotta go get Vittelli and kill him. Good evening. Bonsoir. Well, I see that the booze is plentiful tonight... which is good... because it's good for the house, and what is good for the house is ultimately good for yours truly. Now I shall... mesmerize you... all of you. - Hypnotize you. - How's it goin', Sonny? - Busy. - And make you use your imaginations... to take you on another trip... to another day... to another dream... another dollar. Imagination. Imagination  Is funny  It makes a cloudy day  Sunny  Makes the bees  Think of honey  Just as I  Think of you  Imagination  Is crazy  Your whole perspective  Gets hazy  Starts you asking a daisy  What to do  What to do  Have you ever felt  A gentle touch  And then a kiss  And then  And then find it's only  Your imagination again  Oh, well  Imagination  Is silly  You go around  Willy-nilly  For example  I go around  Wanting you  Take it off now. And yet  I can't  Imagine  Fabulous place. - Thanks. - For times delizioso. Good girls. Just like home. I've been waiting a long time. I've been playing games. Do you know Match One? - Five, four, three, two, one. - Yeah. - Do you play? - Well, not now. Got a little problem here. You know... I gotta meet some friends at 11:00. Maybe you should, like, come along. We're all fairly interested in your experience. Well, I'll tell you about it, you can tell them, because... I don't feel too hot. No one could have pulled that off. I know myself. - Ten years ago I shoot some Mexican... - Hey. - How you doin'? - I'm gonna buy you a diamond ring. You're kidding. - You love me? - You know I do. - Say you love me. - I love you. I gotta get back. And then  And then find it's only your imagination  I don't want to keep my friends waiting any longer. Again  Over again  Imagination  You're a hell of a nice guy. I never believed I could tell that to anyone. It's too bad I wasn't nice. Where are your friends? Anybody home? That jerk Karl Marx said opium was the... religion of the people. I got news for him. It's money. Money. That's... Jesus Christ. My father was right. Although my father put it another way. You know, capisce? He says... Mio padre... mi ha detto... "Hai fatto... una bella cacata." Yeah. It's a great enjoyment, a good crap. You know what's wrong with the world, Cosmo? Including me and everybody else that might be here. The whole world needs to fart at the same time. There's nothing wrong with you, Cosmo. Money. Money. My father was a nice guy. You should have met my father. He could listen to me like you could. That's why I like you. There's not many people that can listen like my father. You cry when your father died? He promised me one thing. He said, "Hey" "Don't let 'em bury me." Didn't like the electric company, the gas company, the water company. Why don't you do yourself a favor and get out of here? You're an amateur. Take a walk. Where are you going? That's my friend in there. Take care of him. He's your problem. Say hello to everybody and give them my love. "Za," play ball. Asshole. Vittelli. Cosmo? "Cosimodo"? It's Mort. Cosmo. Hey, Cosmo. Sorry about that. In fact, I'm sorry about the whole thing, Cosmo, but... it couldn't be helped, you know. I mean, that's why we're here to talk about it. It just happened to be you. I like you. I personally like ya. I felt it when I met you. It was instincts, ya know. I just know the whole mess is on the news. I don't know if they know who you are. I don't know if they know you're connected with us or not. But we can get you out of town for a while. We'll take care of the joint for you. You come back in, you run the joint just the way you wanna. It's your place. Fire the acts, hire 'em. Stage it. Whatever you wanna do. You've got some kind of guts, man. You know who that was? You know who the Chinaman was? He was the heaviest cat on the West Coast, Cosmo. You did what we couldn't do. I mean, you knew you were set up, didn't you? I mean, it was a plan, and I was part of it, but... I like myself, you know. I mean... I believe you could kill me right now, and if that's what you want to do... then go ahead... but you've got enough heat on you already, and we can help you. Hey, Phil. Dago! I'm gonna kill you! Hey, champ! I think it's about time to make a deal. Answer me, ya son oaf bitch! Vittelli? Vittelli! The Dow Jones industrial average went up...

I mean, in case you were wondering whether I was dying. We were a little bit curious, yes. Never felt better in my life. Could I have a talk with you a moment, please? - Oh, sure. - What's happening? Will somebody please tell me what's goin' on. Don't worry, Rach. I got a lot of insurance. - I'm serious. What's go... - I gotta go talk to your mother. Could we please have a talk? Well, now.

I swear to God. How long's that coffee been there? Cosmo, I think what happened... was wrong. And you won't go to the doctor... because you think you're gonna live... with the bullet in you. And I don't want you in my house no more. Because I'm not strong enough for you. Okay, babe. Listen. I wish you luck in whatever you endeavor. And I gotta go because there are no rivers here. - I still love you. - Yeah. - But you can't stay here no more. - Absolutely.
