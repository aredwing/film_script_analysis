LOST COLONY Jul 221587, Roanoke Island, Virginia Six Months Later. Elenore... Lend me your hand. I think I am perfectly capable. Yes, I know are. Thank you. No, thank you, for at least allowing me the illusion of being useful. What is it? It's nothing. It's perfectly normal, to feel out of sorts. After all, it will take some time. I reacted selfishly. Our child... will see prosperity here, that you or I have never known. There's nothing selfish in that. Do you believe in me? Look! Of course I do. It's beautiful. Come. What do you mean, there's no sign of Raleighs men? You best come with me. All I know, you'll be happy here, my love. to guard the Fort... only this remains, Sir. For a body to decompose, to such an advanced state. This man died some time ago... as much as 6 or 7 months. Another thing is, he was alone, when he opt himself in here. Why they dig a ditch, around the entire Fort? The other question is... where did they all go? The only thing we know for sure, this poor bastard was the only one alive. And he chose hanging... instead facing whatever it was, on the other side of that wall. How can you possibly know that? The gate and the door, were locked from the inside... and there was no one else here, Governor. And what about that? He wrote: People you are warned... you see for yourself now... this story is not so uncertain. This is more than likely, some old Spanish phrase... simply meant to frighten us off and nothing more. We'll then use strength in our resolve, gentlemen. In any in case, they're gonna have to do better then... nonsensical writings on a rock. It's old Norse. The language of the Vikings. What's it says? Save your soul... before they'll take it from you. It's the writings of a Mad-man and nothing more. It wont do them any good, at that. Somebody clean that, will you. George... Leave it be. You knew this man? Yes, I did. I'm sorry, Ananias. If you do not leave, beware of the winter nights... they're the most dangerous. And never... go into the heart of the forest. The sun will set soon. I must go, my friend. I see. Their you are, ladies. - Good evening, Elizabeth. - Good evening, Ananias. So, tell us sister, what were you two cackling about? Oh, we... we were talking about... Actually, we heard the most distrusting rumor. Oh really? What's that? That there was no sign, of the soldiers... left behind, to guard the Fort. - And they'd all been murdered. - Or worse. Well, I wouldn't, huh... alarm yourselves, ladies, it's true... they weren't here, I can assure you, they weren't murdered. They simply left with Captain Granville, when he passed by... - several weeks ago. - But, how can you be sure? Captains journal, in the Out-post. If I know my father, he's having them shot, for abandoning their post. Yes, probably. Listen, plans change all the time, if they hadn't left... when they did, they could have been stuck here for months. Is everything in order, Christopher? What'd you think, my father up to now? I believe your father, is about to make an address. - Here you are, Emmy. - Thank you. I just wanted to see, how you were faring it. It couldn't be better. - I'll be close by, if you need me. - Okay. The old man's been looking for you, Ananias. Why? What did you do now? Governor White, like to request the attention, of all persons present. Brave English Journey-men. I stand with you tonight... a humble servant of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. Although you have traveled far and long... the road ahead, shall be even longer yet. Tomorrow your real journey will begin. But tonight we're going to celebrate. We're going to celebrate our arrival... on this island, which we will come to know as our own. God bless this Isle of Roanoke. And long live the Queen. - Long live the Queen. - Long live the Queen. Your old man certainly has a way about him, right? - Oh yes, yes he does. - He's not that bad. Try being me for a day. So, we're trading'm then, are we? Hm'mm... What'd you think, hm'mm? Are you going to tell me or not? No. Fair enough, you win. After the baby's born, now your father. While you're at it... - find George Howe, for my sister. - Ambrose... Oh God... oh... - OMalley! - Aye, Sir. Is it normal? Can't see with this much fog, beyond of those walls. Nothing's worse than Cardiff. Carry on. Ananias? It's become obvious. We are in desperate need of supplies. So, I'll be leaving here, in a few short weeks, and I shall... deploying you, as acting Governor, until my return. Really, Sir? What about George Howe? He's a top soldier, one of our the best! Let me make this clear to you. I charge in you, looking after the 2 people on this island... meaning more to me, than anything in the world. Eleanor and my future grand-child. And I suspect, you'll be best suited for that task... as Governor, wouldn't you agree? Yes, Sir, I would. - You can rely on me. - Good What the hell? I'll be acting Governor. when your father is away. That's wonderful. Well deserved. Deserved? It's a little more than that. It's everything we hoped for, everything we dreamed of. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just so tired. It's been a long day. Yes, of course it has, Darling. Forgive me, you should rest. Oh, no please, keep the lights on. - Of course. - Thank you. Ananias... My baby! Where is my baby? Please. Somebody. Where is everybody? Please... somebody. She now belongs to us. Give me back my baby. No. What happened? Calm yourself, Sweetheart, calm yourself, it wasn't real. It's okay, what're you doing? Oh, the baby, the baby. I have to make sure. Make sure of what? I had to make sure, that she's still in there. Don't look at me like that, I'm not insane. No, no, I know you're not... It's just, you said, she. - Did I? - Yes. You did. It was... it was just a figment, I suppose. You'll be alright. OH... oh my God. Ananias, something is wrong, something is wrong. Wait, wait, I... I'll be back. Oh, my God. Emmy!... Emmy! Emmy, Emmy, somebody go find us a Midwife. Emmy! Emmy! What is talking so long they? Not you! Get back. Are there complications? It's very strange. It's if someone's trying to induce the birth before it's time. Keep breathing Eleanor, you're doing fine. It's alright my love, it's almost over. Put for, put, push! That's it... Oh my, it's a beautiful baby. Well, it's not in there. This girl belongs to us. Stop her! It's a girl. Emmy, Emmy, you've done it. I guess you were right. It's a girl? She is. She's beautiful. It's your father. Emmy, what can I tell her Majesty, is the name of this beautiful child? It's true Virginia, wouldn't you say, Sir. Virginia Eleanor Dare. - Hip, Hip, Hurray. - Congratulations, Dare. - Well done, my friend. - Well done! - Congratulations. - Thank you, Sir, thank you. As of today, Ananias will be your acting Governor. You're taking your leave, from us then, Sir? If I don't leave soon, I'll be hanged for choosing... against the queen, then we'll never get our supplies. Well, you could always blame it on the weather, Sir. So, I shall. Ah, Thomas returns. From another unsuccessful hunt, by the looks of it. Any luck today? More of the same, I'm afraid. That forest is the void of life. No birds, or nothing. It's down right un-natural. What's un-natural is your lack of skill, with that cross-bow. You know, I have yet to face, of anything you've caught either... my friend. Ananias, I need a word with you. Yes, Sir. Don't let this Governor-shit go to your head, would you. Mm'mm. Yes, Sir. Now Ananias, this is important. If you should run in to trouble, and you're forced to leave. Markup on a tree, with your destination. Along with the Maltese-cross. You should do so, under severe duress. Understood, Sir. I doubt that'll be necessary. You do all of this, Ananias and your reputation in this station... will be guaranteed. Thank you, Sir. Any use to have some thing. - Hungry? - Not yet, no, thank you. Your father will be on that boat tomorrow. Yeah, I know. Long journey. - What's the matter, my love? - Nothing. - The pain still bad? - No. Then what it is? I don't want us, to stay here, in Roanoke. Let's go back to England, with my father. Back to England? Where did this come from? I just don't feel, this is a proper place to raise the child. We've been over this, a hundred times, Eleanor. You know our chances here, are better then we ever see in England. She should be raised, the daughter of some one important. Not yet. I have been entrusted with a responsibility here. If I go back to England now, I'll be branded a coward. Quiet!... There is something wrong with this island. It's simply as easy. Womans intuition, if you will. The future of this family is here. I made your father a promise. Don't think it's worth it. September 22, 1587- Autumnal Equinox Who's there? Who's there? Go on, Ananias, you're not even trying. Just as long as you can catch your breath. It's a perfect big waste of energy. I'll be hearing all about it later. Oh, calm down, it's just some hardworking boys, having some fun. Look, it's your wife. That was a trick. That's distraction. You underestimated, Dare. - He tricked him. - Sure did. - Thomas. - Ananias. It's Ambrose, I think he may be in trouble. - Ambrose? - He went out to the forest to check his traps. And then I heard a gun-shot. Thomas, get the women and children inside the fort. Joseph, we're going after Ambrose. Okay now, inside, inside. Who you think did that? The girl. George? Order the men back. Order them back now. Fall back, to the Fort. Fall back. We've two problems, and a single remedy for both. What's that? The neighboring tribes out-number us. The last thing we need to do, is go to the Mainland... where the could quite easily ambush us, at any time. Ananias, is right... to take natives on, just be suicide. Besides, I'm not even sure, if they done us anything wrong. At first light, I'm crossing the bay, to tell Manteyo about these events. And while I'm gone, Joseph is in charge. Manteyo. I need to see Manteyo. Manteyo! You should not have come here. Leave at once. I need to speak with you. About the island. They were going to kill me. I like you Ananias, and I like John White. The relations with your people, were not being good. This was before, you stole from us. And killed one of us. Manteyo, I'm deeply sorry, but those were not my people. I understand. But my people, do not. I need to know more, about that island. As I told you before, ancient evil runs that forest. Do you believe that? Yes. I know you realize truth in my warning. I tell you Monteyo, in my world there are many superstitions. They come from Myth or Legends. Something terrible happened their ones. How you can be certain? I feel it. Your own people will suffer, if you do not leave. Well, we have no where to go. The ships won't return until spring. I am truly sorry. But I can do nothing. Here. It will protect the wearer, give it to your wife. Or child. I'm not blind. Your wife was many months with child, when last I saw her. I only wish, I could give more. Thank you. Maybe my life. Ananias! You should not come back, my friend. Another nightmare? Something horrific, as that. - Surely it's just a dream. - They're not dreams, they're visions. It's alright Find something to keep her in line. So, gentlemen, what is all the fuss? Something wrong with the crops. Maybe we missed the season, ever since the temperature... began to drop last month, nothing seems to grow. Over a dozen died already, from sickness and hunger. I'm beginning to wonder, how many of us will be left... by the time the ships come back. We have to cut rations another 20%. Another 20%? I've barely enough to feed my family, as it is. What'd you say, in trading with the Natives? Raleighs men, already cost us that option. They will no longer have anything to do with us. Then we take what we need. Careful, Edward. Maybe we should reconsider, moving back to the Mainland. No, we already gone over that. This island is our only defensible position. We're to vulnerable for attack. Besides, it might as well be sooner, to see us starve. It's to late in the season to plant any crops. - Right, Sam? - Yes, Sir. The task I was given, gentlemen. It is to maintain this island, in case we go to war with Spain. And that is exactly, what we are going to do. Until, we can do, something longer? Yeah... Tonight is old Halloween. We got to celebrate. It's good for morale. - Good evening, Governor. - Good evening, Thomas. Festivities going well? Not really, I didn't have a drop. Really? I thought Williams was supposed to be on duty. He was, I relieved him. Yeah... well, I'm here now. You should be with your wife and daughter. Yes, I should. - Stay well, Thomas. - Good night. - She is beautiful. - Thank you. Ladies, how are the festivities? Could go a bid better, then it looks. I will leave you two, at alone, I'm going off to bed. Do you think there's a chance, Ambrose is still out there somewhere? Why don't you go with Virginia inside, it's getting cold. That's impossible. Miss! Miss! Miss! Miss, are you alright? You shouldn't be out here on your own. I'm so lonely. So very lonely/ Well, you're not alone anymore. No, not anymore. You will die! You will die. Stop... You will die here. We have trouble! Thomas is missing. Summon the men. - Well? - There's no sign of him. Who is the last one to see him? I was, just a couple of hours ago. Who could provoke him, to abandon his post? Someone is clearly trying to scare us off. No Spanish ships have been anywhere near this island. My men would have seen them. Well, that only leaves one other possibility. I already told you, the Croatians would want nothing to do with us. Exactly, they just soon be rid of us, as help us. This is why we will have to intensify our defenses. George! From now on, multiple men on duty, day and night. Consider it done. We look for Thomas again in the morning. Tell the others it's time, we leave at first light. Go, go, go, come on! Come on. - Go! Go! - Keep up over there. - Over here. - Alright, alright, alright. Go! Go! Fall back, go! Come on! Go! Go, go! How many of my men did you loose? - HOW MANY? - Twelve. Someone had to take action. Arrogant Fool! You lost us more than just men. Your mutinies action, cost us any change, we had with the Croatians. If they didn't want us stay before. They certainly do now. Put him in the stocks! You think the Croatians will retaliate? They don't have to. They already think we lost. Close the gates! Do you think, we should keep him in there all night? By rights he should be hanged. But we don't need further, degrade morale. But there must be some place for punishment to their actions. Damn him! He endangered the well being of this entire colony. The very least, a lot less mouths to feed. Don't think, I haven't thought the same... as morbid as it is. Ananias. You said, you don't suspect the Natives, are part in that. What's your question? Between you and me. What do you think, is going on? It's not the Natives. I find it alarming, just how much time you spend with those journals. Surely you understand the value of this things. But you act, as if that journal... would be the only record of our presence here. And what's more alarming is, I'm starting to feel the same. What is it you're not telling me, Eleanor? What do you see in your dreams? Speaks to me! I never told for fear, of sounding of my mind. What I've seen are horrible, impossible things. What things? Men dying, in the most unimaginable ways. A women in a cave, tortured! Left to die. There is a presence here, on the island. Maligned and diseased. They want her. Dear God. What? What is it? There is something, I haven't told you as well. You have visions of your own? No, not exactly. The men, that were left here to guard the Fort. Before we arrived. They never left with Granville, did they? You knew this... while we still had the option, of leaving, instead living... I'm sorry, Eleanor, but I... I couldn't... I can't believed it... - I couldn't, your father made me... - What did happened to them then? Nobody knows... We found a skeleton, behind it... a man, who hung himself, I knew once before... This is one of my visions, I saw this man. I saw him hung himself. Eleanor, this is important. What else did you see? I saw Virginia. Who's there? Identify yourself. Dear God! Ananias! Stay here. Lock the door. Save your soul. Before they take it from you. Summon father Jacob, to the command post. Ananias, my son. Jacob. I ask you here, we're clearly faced... with an unholy adversary. I need to know, what course of action to take. Well... well, first to get my Good-book. I'm forced to admit, but... my knowledge does not extent to the practice of the Devil. The great evil is imprisoned here. Poison... and everything around it... the darkest of spirits, trapped between life and death What it is? During my travels to the North-lands. I heard of these... things. The circle of Wraiths. I believed it to be Legend. What exactly is a Wraith? If you believe in myths. Tortured spirits, trapped in this world and the next. The Vikings feared them. Because they fed on the souls, of the living. That's what you speak of, is myth. This... this, is a very poor problem. And what if it is... who ever extracted, the life out of that man... is no myth. Samuel, cover him up. I don't understand... how weapons of this nature, are going to help. It only stands to reason... when at first those leachy hounds expose themselves to our raum... it's only for moments. But at that moment... in our raum. they're vulnerable. I hope you're right. I guess we'll find out soon enough. Eleanor. What? I want Virginia to wear this. I told you, I don't want that thing around her neck. It's not Christian. Neither is, what's in that forest. Alright. Gentlemen. To your post. Women and children, are safe as possible. Good. What exactly in the hell, are you excepting to see? You should know, the spirits. The Wraiths. I never really believed, in pagan legend before. You still believe in God? Yes, I do. Let's hope we're sill here in the morning... and pray. What's happening, listen? North-wall, do you see anything? No, Sir. - South-wall! - Nothing to report. I can feel it, the temperature. Hold your ground, men! Hold your ground! They become vulnerable, just before attack. - I'm going down there, my men need me. - No, I need you here. My men need me down there. Protect the women and children. Come on, one remaining. God be with us. Don't abandon us, in time of our weakness. Your presence gives us strength. Lead us not into temptation. Protect us from evil. There! Don't fire! Hold it! Hold! Open, it's save, they're gone. I do not understand, why couldn't they get to you? Holy water. It protected us. No, the other night you saw for yourself. No, it wasn't that. Open the gate. It's the water, plane and simple. Seems like it protected for us. Manteyo assured you, they wont attack during day? He talked only about the winter nights... he said nothing of the days. He also just learned English. So, no one leaves a waterless hole from now on. - Ananias. - What? We lost over half our men last night. We can't possibly expect to fight these things again... like that and survive. You saw, they can't cross water... we'll be safe enough, if we stay inside the water of the Fort. That much maybe true. But our food stock is running dangerously low. We either have the Wraiths... or starvation. It wont matter. So, our survival then, depends on the inability of these... Wraiths, to cross water? Water signifies life, the Wraiths death. Oh, this would explain, your inert inability to leave... - the island as well. - It's their prison. I do anything, not become our grave. I don't understand. Why I be able to see the Wraiths vision? Why are they tormenting me? They say, a woman's intuitive power is strongest... during the time she's pregnant. You're connections to Virginia are so strong... she can't sense anything else would be alife for her. What makes her so special? They seam to kill indiscriminately. No, it's not indiscriminate. According to lost myth. The Wraight merely survives on the soul of the innocent. To actually cross over, they need the soul of an innocent. One devoid of all sin. To cover their image of evil. So, the visions are true. They won't leave us alone, until they have her. Now listen, I will never let that happened to her. I promise you that. Keep the men alert! Just in case. Stay alert, gentleman! Be ready for anything. The men are exhausted, they haven't slept for two days. Then will have to start sleeping, during the day. Ananias, we can not sit here night after night... with these damn things out there. Eventually, they will find a way in. What do you want me to do? The ships wont be back until spring. I backed your decisions before... but, perhaps it is time to move to the Main-land. After what Gregory and his men did, that would be suicide. And what do you calls this? - I'm sorry, just... - No, you're right. I only had the colonies, well being in mind. We can't stay here. But we can't leave either. George, the answer to this, is out there. We have to find the source of their power. And destroy it. We correlating our gunpowder to the life explosives... it should do impeccable damage to them. Great. Besides, firing bullets at those damn creatures... just seems to do more harm than good. What exactly are we looking for? I suspect, we will when we find it. Think we did. I don't understand. I thought they were powerless during the day. - My God. - What? Manteo warned me. It's the forest! The Wraights control it. Avoid it! - Try to go down! - Abort! Retreat! Retreat! Back to the Fort! Open the gate! Open the gate now! Ananias, are you alright? Ananias! What happened? Where are the others? What happened? You! Build a ditch in front this building and fill it with water... exactly the same, as around this Fort. - Oh, come on. - Not, now! - Do it! - Yes, Sir. Why wont you talk to me? I failed you. And I failed everybody. No one could have foreseen this. If I had listened you. Virginia would be save. You would be save. I don't know what to do anymore. Virginia is still alive, and so am I. You will think of something, I still believe in you. I always have. Wraith get in... - They wont. - If they do... You need to... And you did well, building the inner ditch, around the compound. At least the women and children will survive. That sound will go with me, till the end of my days. How ever long that may be. Please, let us in. We are so lonely. Please, talk to me. What's that man doing? You there! What're you doing? Return to your post. You there! Somebody stop that man! NOW! - Come over here! - No, don't! Keep the gate closed! What's going on there? No! No! Don't! No! Don't do it! No! She's walking over! To Arms men! Two rows of rifles! First row! Down! Aim! Fire! Reload! Down! Second row! Aim! Fire! Reload! Reload! Stand, forward! Don't let the children be taken. George! For God sake! Unlock the door! Eleanor, don't open it, they will kill us all! - Let's get him on the table! - Why they do this? Jacob... Get him some water, now! How did the get inside the Fort? I thought we were safe! She possessed Christopher. Everyone stay away from the door! - We have to give them the baby, Sir. - What's that you said? I said, we have to give them the baby. - Why should we all die for your child? - You better be quiet, before I'll kill! I will!... Stay away from my daughter! You understand me? Do you understand? Do I make myself clear? Eleanor, I want anything up against that door. Away from the wall, right now! How bad is it? He's infected. Where're you going? See Manteo. - He will kill you. - We have no choice. I'm coming with you. No... not this time. Ananias. Take this. Just take the damn gun. Ananias, be careful. I can not protect you, if they find you, they would want blood. I need your help. It's simple not possible, after your men attacked... You know I didn't give that order. Word has spread to the other tribes. There is nothing for you here. Then we have no hope. We will surely be death soon... friend. They say there is a cave, on the island... in the hearth of the forest, a place where the evil comes. A cave? Are you sure? This story, that has been past down for generations. You must take me there. Impossible. You believe in warnings? Then, heed mine. The day will come... when that evil, will no longer be trapped on that island. It will make it's way here. Can you live in peace, with the knowledge... that you could have stopped it? The forest will not allow, save passage. It will today. Manteo! How much further? This rain could stop any moment. Rain not quitting. There. Eleanor was right. Just in case it's a coincidence. Come on. Look. It's old Norse. Can you read it? It tells of the great expedition... that was driven hundreds of miles, of it's course... until, it landed on an island to the south. Of course there is an old Viking tale, of a great voyage. One of the passengers, a woman, was believed a witch... along with her two followers was tortured to death... let the Vikings to be the blame. The Vikings believed that this horrible dead... refused them entry to Valhalla, the Vikings paradise. Manteo, it happened here, this is the place. But how do we rid the land of these spirits? According to their beliefs... fire is the necessary element for their passage. Their bones must be given to a flame. Their are no bones. For the ritual to work... the pyres are usually accompanied by prayer. To give them passage... some part is missing. They are between worlds, how can we use fire against them? If I say this in their presence... perhaps I can trap them here... long enough... to keep them corporal. Mortal. Then the rest of their bodies... what is left of their unholy souls... will be extinguished forever. I don't know how to repay you, Manteo. What must we do now? No, you must go. You and your people already suffered enough. What will you do? I'm going to give them, what they want. - Someone get the door. - I'm on it. - I told you I'd return. - Oh my God. You were right Eleanor, about everything. Your dreams may yet be blessings. I feared, I wouldn't see you again. - So you are suggesting that we build a... - A raft, yes. We'll grant them, their long awaited passage to Valhalla. - Like the river stakes. - Yes, exactly. It don't make no sense, a spiritual vessel? Not to see their demons, they're making use of the human souls as disguises... to cross over and they can do so, when free off all sin. But Ananias, I don't see their purpose, exactly. They also believe, that a pyres is necessary, to set the spirit free... to enter Valhalla. - This is nonsense, there's no such place. - You believe in heaven and hell? The same thing, different religion. With this, they'll have their passage to the after life... and let's hope, that we can give it to them. Heaven, Hell, Valhalla... - it doesnt matter, right now. - It does matter, George, make no mistake. These things... one place, and I'm sending there myself! Let's get to work. Thank you, Angel. What? You haven't called me that, in a long time. We've been trapped in this nightmare for so long, it feels like, forever. Seems, we haven't had a moment of normality. Yes, yes, it's been far to long. Here. George! - It's okay, I'm alright. - You shouldn't be out here. The hell with that, I sooner die here, than be on that damn table. George, you shouldn't swear. Are any candles at the post lid. Right. Ananias. Ananias, wake up! Look! Look! My God, where are the children? No! They're all gone. It's not your fault! Yes, yes it is. I should have known. We've got to finish that raft. Got it. Tiden this tide. Up a bid, pull it on back. Now, pull it tide. Come on. Alright, it goes in the corner, Father! Samuel, give me more hemp. It's done, George, it's done. Up! One more push to go, everybody, one, two, three, up. What's this for? The Governor, on his return... will see that, if he wont be finding us here. You really think, this is gonna work? I don't believe in coincidences. Nedvalla? Dare. Your last name? Yes, but in old Norse... it means... die! Every man has his destiny, George. This is mine. Oh... Ananias, I ah... No harm will come to her, I promise you. the instant the Wraiths are onboard the raft... I start to recite the passage from the cave. If it's a trap, I put Virginia in the water and send her back to you. What about you? Don't worry about me. What's your problem? I don't understand, why you can't wait. Once your on the raft, they can just... I don't want her to die, anymore than you do. But, I can't leave anything to chance, I going to see them gone! Let's just take the raft, the 6 of us and get away from the island. Why can't we seem to leave? I can't do that. I can't allow this evil to kill anyone of us. Everyone to their position! You two, don't release the raft, until you get my signal. George. You know what to do. Fire the flaming arrow, once you're far enough out. You sure you can? I can fire a damn arrow, Ananias. I love you. Look after her for me. I'll always be with you, in this world or the next. They're coming. Come, I have what you want. Get in the water. No! Eleanor, don't! Get back in the water. No! No! No! Eleanor. Eleanor. Eleanor. Follow me! Come on! George! Now! George, come on, they're on board! There! Now, I'm setting you free! Come on, baby... Baby... remember us. May her spirit rest in peace.
