SOMETIMES SHE STAYS AWAKE ALL NIGHT. JUST CRYING. YEAH, BABIES CRY AN AVERAGE OF FOUR HOURS A DAY. IT'S THERE ONLY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. SHE ONLY CRIES WHEN I'M AROUND. AS SOON AS PETER COMES INTO THE ROOM, OR MY SISTER NICOLE... SHE STOPS. IT'S LIKE... SHE IS TRYING TO GET AT ME... SOMEHOW. JAMIE, POST PARTUM DEPRESSION IS VERY COMMON, ESPECIALLY AFTER A DIFFICULT BIRTH. MANY FIRS TIME MOTHERS-- I'M NOT A FIRST TIME MOTHER. OH I'M SORRY I THOUGHT... I HAD A DAUGHTER. AMANDA. SHE DROWNED IN AN ACCIDENT TWO YEARS AGO. I AM SO SORRY. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING FOR YOU. DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AMANDA? I FEEL SO GUILTY, HAVING THESE THOUGHTS. IT'S JUS HARD YOU KNOW.

ISN'T THIS GREAT? IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A NANNY CAM WE WOULD HAVE MISSED THE FIRS TIME THAT SHE SAT UP. YOU KILLED ME MOMMY! THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY. HEY! ...THEN CHUCK ASKED DEVIN AND ME TO MOVE BACK IN WITH HIM. THE WHOLE TIME HIS NOSE IS TWITCHING LIKE THE SKIN IS GOING TO JUMP OFF HIS FACE.

BUT YOU HAVE TO LET THAT GO. YOU'VE GOT A HEALTHY, BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL. YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T WE JUS BLOW THIS FEAST. WHY DON'T WE JUS BLEND SOME MARGUERITAS AND JUS CHILL OUT? AAAH. PETER'S PARENTS ARE ALREADY ON THE WAY. I'LL BE OKAY. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE I'M THE FAMILY SCREW UP, REMEMBER? I'M GLAD YOU ARE HERE.

HONEY WHAT HAPPENED? IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU SCREAMED BEFORE YOU FELL? NO... I SCREAMED AS I FELL. DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE...? TAKE YOUR TIME. DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A BABY TO BE BORN EVIL? EVIL ACTIONS ARE THE RESUL OF CONSCIOUS CHOICE, JAMIE. A CHOICE INFANT'S AREN'T CAPABLE OF MAKING. DO YOU THINK CAITLIN'S EVIL? SOMETIMES... SOMETIMES I LOOK AT THAT BABY MONITOR AND I SEE HER SITTING THERE WIDE AWAKE, JUST THINKING ABOUT ME. THINKING ABOU WAYS TO KILL ME. JAMIE. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR WOMEN SUFFERING SEVERE POST PARTUM DEPRESSION TO FIXATE ON THE NEWBORN AS THE SOURCE OF EVIL OR DANGER IN THE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE BIRTH. YOU ARE NO ALONE, JAMIE. I AM ALONE. AND PETER'S TOO BUSY WITH WORK. AND NICOLE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY AND EVEN THEN... I'M HERE FOR YOU JAMIE. AND FROM WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME YOUR FAMILY WANTS TO HELP BUT YOU HAVE GO TO REACH OUT TO THEM. MAYBE I JUST WASN'T READY TO BE A MOTHER AGAIN. I THINK YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE DEEPER ISSUE. I REALIZE AMANDA'S DEATH IS A VERY PAINFUL SUBJECT FOR YOU, BUT WE HAVE TO BROACH IT EVENTUALLY. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT HER? I LOVED HER. AMANDA WAS SUCH A GOOD GIRL. WHAT WAS SHE LIKE? WHAT WAS HER FAVOURITE FOOD? SHE LOVED SUGAR COOKIES. SHE WOULD HAVE EATEN THEM EVERYDAY IF I LET HER. WHAT ELSE? DID SHE LIKE TO PLAY? YOU KNOW WHAT? I UMM ...I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HER RIGHT NOW. THAT'S OKAY JAMIE. WHEN YOU ARE READY. MOMMY. MOMMY. MOMMY. IT'S FREEZING IN HERE. IT'S SO COLD. MONDAY'S CHILD IS FAIR OF FACE. TUESDAY'S CHILD IS FULL OF GRACE. WEDNESDAY'S CHILD IS FULL OF WOE. WEDNESDAY'S CHILD IS FULL OF WOE. YOU WERE BORN ON A WEDNESDAY WEREN'T YOU KATE? JUST LIKE YOUR SISTER. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? JAMIE? JAMIE, HONEY WAKE UP. OH, ARE YOU ALRIGHT? YEAH YOU JUST SCARED ME. I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP. IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO COMFORTABLE. COME HERE SWEETHEART. SHHH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HMMM. YOU ARE STARING AT NICOLE. WHAT? YOU WERE STARING AT MY SISTER'S ASS. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT IT? ADMIT WHAT? THAT YOU WANT TO SLEEP WITH HER. I DON' BELIEVE THIS. JAMIE, YOU NEED HELP. OH. I NEED HELP? YOU'RE THE ONE STARING AT MY SISTER'S ASS. IS THAT HOW YOU GET OFF? FANTASIZING ABOUT HER? THAT'S DISGUSTING. Hey! HI HOW YA DOING? YOU ALRIGHT? DON'T TALK TO HER ABOUT ME. AMANDA.... AAAH? MR. ASHFORD? YES. MY NAME IS SUSANNA RUSSELL. I'M A PSYCHIATRIST. JAMIE IS MY PATIENT. I'M SORRY. JAMIE NEVER MENTIONED YOU. THE HOSPITAL CONTACTED ME WHEN SHE CHECKED IN. HOW IS SHE DOING? SHE GOT A BAD CUT ON HER FINGER BUT SHE'S FINE. THEY ARE JUST FINISHING UP THE STITCHES NOW. WHY IS MY WIFE SEEING YOU DR. RUSSELL? I'VE BEEN HELPING JAMIE DEAL WITH THE DEPRESSION SHE HAS STRUGGLED WITH SINCE CAITLIN'S BIRTH. WELL YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD I AM TO HEAR THAT. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HER TO SEE SOMEONE. MR. ASHFORD, I'M WORRIED THAT JAMIE'S CONDITION IS WORSENING. SHE COULD BE SUFFERING FROM POST PARTUM PSYCHOSIS. JAMIE'S HAD A ROUGH TIME, BUT SHE'S NOT PSYCHOTIC. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOU YOUR WIFE'S STATE OF MIND. SHE ALMOST CU OFF HER FINGER. THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT. WAS IT? YOU THINK SHE DID THAT ON PURPOSE? THAT'S CRAZY. DURING HER LAST VISI JAMIE TOLD ME THA SHE THINKS THAT CAITLIN IS TRYING TO KILL HER. JAMIE WOULD NEVER SAY THAT. I WOULD LIKE YOUR PERMISSION TO HOLD JAMIE IN THE PSYCHIATRIC WARD HERE FOR A FEW DAYS. I'M NOT PUTTING MY WIFE IN A LOONEY BIN. IT'S AN EXCELLEN FACILITY MR. ASHFORD. JUST LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A PROPER ASSESSMENT. JAMIE NEEDS SOMEONE TO TALK TO. SHE DOESN'T NEED TO BE LOCKED AWAY. IN 1987 CHERYL MASEP DROVE HER CAR OVER HER INFANT SON. SHE SAID IT WAS THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD GET RELIEF FROM THE VOICES IN HER HEAD. A FEW YEARS AGO, ANDREA YATES DROWNED HER FIVE SONS IN A BATHTUB, THEN SHE CALLED 911 SAYING SHE COULDN' COPE ANY LONGER. JAMIE... I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS AWHILE AND I WAN YOU TO KNOW YOU'RE DOING GREAT, BUT THERE IS STILL ONE SUBJECT WE NEED TO DISCUSS. AMANDA. JAMIE? WE ARE UP AT CHUCK AND NICOLE'S COTTAGE. AMANDA WAS OUTSIDE PLAYING. COME ON BABE... IT'S YOUR TURN. HONEY, IT'S YOUR TURN. YOU KNOW I WAN TO GET AMANDA. I DON'T WAN HER WANDERING OFF. WAIT, WAIT WAIT, FIRST PLAY YOUR TURN. YOU PLAY THEM FOR ME. HEY AMANDA, WHY DON'T YOU COME INSIDE? NO. IF YOU COME INSIDE, I'LL MAKE YOU SOME HOT CHOCOLATE. NO. WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO TELL YOU TEN TIMES. AMANDA WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO CHASE YOU. AMANDA! AMANDA! STAY AWAY FROM THE WATER. HOW DID YOU GET OVER THERE? AMANDA... THIS ISN'T FUNNY. AMANDA STOP! AMANDA... STOP! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AMANDA! AMANDA! AMANDA! AMANDA! AMANDA, WHERE ARE YOU? NO! PETER, PETER! AMANDA! HELP ME! AMANDA! PETER! AMANDA! I SHOULD HAVE WATCHED HER BETTER. I SHOULDN'T HAVE LE HER GO OUTSIDE ON HER OWN. YOU CAN'T KEEP BLAMING YOURSELF JAMIE. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. YOU'VE BEEN DEALING WITH OVERWHELMING GUILT. THAT IS THE ROO OF YOUR DEPRESSION. PETER THOUGHT HAVING ANOTHER BABY WOULD MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER. BUT I DIDN'T WAN TO REPLACE AMANDA. AND YOU CAN'T... BUT YOU ALSO CAN'T CARRY YOUR GUILT OVER TO CAITLIN. YOUR FEAR OF SOMETHING HAPPENING TO HER IS DRIVING A WEDGE BETWEEN YOU. YOU HAVE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD BY COMING TO TERMS WITH THE PAST. PERHAPS SOMEDAY, YOU'LL REALIZE THA SOME PART OF AMANDA LIVES ON IN CAITLIN. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. I THINK SOMETHING DOES. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? FINE. HOW DID IT GO? FINE. WE GOT YOU CAKE FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY. I'M NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD TO CELEBRATE. AHH, IT'LL BE FUN. IT'S JUS THE FIVE OF US. IT'LL CHEER YOU UP. OH, GOOD GIRL. CAN YOU LOOK AT DADDY? KATIE?

HEY, IF I HAD TO GO AROUND APOLOGIZING FOR THAT I'D NEVER GET ANOTHER WORD IN. DON'T SWEAT IT. HEY... WHAT YOU GOT THERE, HUH? AMANDA WAS QUITE A HANDFUL. SHE WAS AHHH... A STRONG WILLED LITTLE GIRL. WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? OH IT'S... DR. RUSSELL. SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. TELL HER I HAVE A HEADACHE. I'LL TALK TO HER AT MY APPOINTMENT TOMORROW. DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE.... DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A BABY TO BE BORN EVIL? DURING THE BIRTH. I FELT LIKE SHE WAS TRYING TO KILL ME. SOMETIMES I LOOK AT THA BABY MONITOR AND I SEE HER JUS SITTING THERE WIDE AWAKE JUST THINKING ABOUT ME. THINKING ABOU WAYS TO KILL ME. I SEE THE CROW. A SOUL IS IN FLIGHT. A LITTLE GIRL. SHE IS HUNGRY FOR LIFE. HATE MAKES THE SOUL STRONG. CIRCLES THE EARTH LIKE A BIRD IN FLIGHT WAITING. BABY'S SOUL ISN'T FIRMLY SECURED TO THE BODY... IT GLITTERS, MAKING IT A WEAK, EASY PREY FOR AN OLDER SOUL TO PUSH OUT. FEELS SO GOOD, YEAH... YEAH, RIGHT THERE. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? PETER GET YOUR ASS OFF THAT BED RIGHT NOW! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT... YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH HER? IS THAT WHA IS HAPPENING? GOD JAMIE CHILL. I JUST HAD A PINCHED NERVE. YEAH I KNOW WHA YOU ARE DOING.

I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO CATCH UP ON. BECAUSE OF ME? JAMIE, I REALLY CAN'T GE INTO THIS RIGHT NOW, OKAY? PETER. WHAT IS IT? LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. OKAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO ME, BUT I PROMISE THINGS ARE GOING TO GET BETTER. I SPOKE TO NICOLE THIS MORNING. THAT CONDO SHE IS INTERESTED IN IS STILL AVAILABLE. SHE IS GOING TO SIGN A LEASE SO... MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? EXHAUSTED. WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO BED? BECAUSE I CAN'T SLEEP. AND EVERY TIME I DO I HAVE THESE HORRIBLE NIGHTMARES. IT'S THE MEDS. DOCTOR RUSSELL SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. I'M JUST SO TIRED. I FEEL LIKE I AM EMPTIED OUT. SNAP OUT OF IT, OR SOMETHING. SNAP OUT OF IT? YOU THINK THIS IS JUST A SWITCH I CAN TURN ON AND OFF? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. WELL THAT'S WHA IT SOUNDED LIKE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD THIS IS FOR ME? DO YOU EVEN CARE? WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKE FOR ME JAMIE? YOU STOMP AROUND THE HOUSE WITH A BLACK CLOUD OVER YOUR HEAD. YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME YOU WERE SEEING DR. RUSSELL. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU WANT OR HOW TO HELP YOU. YOU CAN HELP ME BY PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO ME. LIKE YOU DO TO NICOLE AND DEVIN AND EVERYBODY ELSE BUT ME. EVERY TIME I TRY I GET SHOT DOWN.
