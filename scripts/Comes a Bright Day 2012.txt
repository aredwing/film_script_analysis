It doesn't look strong enough to carry the weight of the stones. In a piece like this the materials are, in a way, irrelevant. It's what he was trying to achieve, the, the overall effect. What would she have said? Have you bought your tickets yet? Yep. I've got six weeks to go. Your mind's made up then? Yes, Charlie. Better see to that customer. # Ooh, look at that # Look at her walking # Turning my head Good afternoon, sir. Where would you like me to put this? Don't worry, I got it. That's the Leoville-Barton '87 you ordered, sir. Would you like me to open that for you, sir? Let it breathe? Nah. Mr. Morgan wonders whether this may be appropriate for your friend? Cute. Oh, for Mr. Morgan. Tell him everything is, um... ... awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you, sir. Have a nice day, sir. I've got a job for you. Right, Mr. Morgan. Mr. O'Sullivan in the Hyde Park Suite asked me to give you this, Mr. Morgan, sir. Got a guest in room 417. Bought her son a watch for his 21st birthday. Now it's a little big, so we need one link taken out of the bracelet. I need you to take it to Clara's Antique Jewelers on Bury Street and ask for Charlie. And you tell him that I sent you. Yes, Mr. Morgan. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Good afternoon, Mrs. Lieberman. I hope you're looking after Sam, Mr. Morgan. You know he's my favorite. He's mine too, Mrs. Lieberman. Concierge. Ah Mr. Giles, do you mind holding for just a moment? You make sure that they do it while you wait. The guest needs it back in her suite at 5:00. So you get straight back here, no delays. Yes, Mr. Morgan. Oh, and Smith... I'm watching you. Yes, Mr. Morgan. Get going. Smith... Straighten that name badge. Mr. Giles, thanks for holding. Yeah, I'm sure the house doctor has informed you that the guest had a fatal heart attack earlier this afternoon. How dare he die in my hotel? # Look at her walking # Turning my head # Taking my breath away London. Eight million of us all with our own dreams. A city full of opportunity. And for those whose dreams come true, there's no better place to be. Every whim can be indulged, itch scratched and desire catered for. A few streets where the wealthiest magpies swoop for the brightest and shiniest objects. And, man, do I wish I was part of that world. Very nice. What keeps me going on days like today is the thought that when my dream comes true, it'll be me ordering room service from my swanky hotel suite... Me getting the girl. Oh yeah, and me remembering to tip properly. I just need that one piece of luck, the shot at the title. To know when opportunity is knocking and make sure I answer the bloody door. Just when I thought today couldn't get any worse... Radio London FM, 4:30, cold and wet outside... It's all there. Cheers, pal. It's 320 now, innit? What are you talking about? We had a price, You can't just slap on an extra 33% just like that. What do you mean I can't? I just did, didn't I? Yesterday it was 240, today it's 320. Do you want them or what? You know I can't leave empty handed. Yeah. What you got there? Two, four, six, eight... We had a deal. Yeah, well, that's the way it goes innit? Here ya go, enjoy the show. It's a blinder... Good luck. Ta-ta. All right? Yeah, great. You're a shit negotiator. Mm-hmm, it's lovely to see you too. Found us an investor yet? The business plan is nearly ready. Did you call him? Who? You know who, I gave you his card last week. Did you call him? I left a message. Oh, okay. That's why he asked me today why you hadn't called. Well I-- I'll call him tomorrow... I've been busy. No, I'm gonna call him tomorrow. He loves my food and he's got money. I can't wait for you anymore, Sam. It's like you're scared to ask, take a chance. Go and see some people and ask them to invest in our restaurant. But the business plan, it needs to be rock solid, it needs to be bulletproof. You know how much work I've done. It's no good if no one sees it. I've got to make this happen, with or without you. We've been talking about this since we were at school. I know, I know... It will happen. "Vici." What? "Vici," a name for the restaurant. "Vici?" Yeah. Right, I'd better get my skates on. You eating? Yeah I'll have the special to go. Hi, Elliot. How are you? Yeah, I'm cool. You? I'm starving. Starving I can do. The special is very good. Wild mushroom risotto. I've got one portion left. Yes, please I'll have that. Oh well I just ordered that. Oh, sorry, I didn't hear you. You need to speak up. Ask a bit louder. Ha-ha. Oh, sorry, do you want that? Not, it's okay, you go ahead. Thanks, mate. Are you sure? Yeah. Thanks. That's a great watch. Thanks... yeah, I mean, I like it, it's... We sold one just like that yesterday. Oh, really? Can I have two double espressos to go as well, 'cause Charlie's getting cranky? I need to caffeinate him. You like this? Yeah, love it. Sorry, Mary, er, this is my friend: Sam. Hi, Sam. How are you? I'm okay... you? They're playing in town next week. The band. I always try and get tickets, but they go in, like, Do you work around here? Yeah, I do, I work in Clara. It's an antique jewelry store, just round the corner. Right, yeah, I've heard of it, yeah. That's a beautiful bracelet. Thank you. It's-- it's from the shop. You should come and check it out. Yeah, maybe I'll do that. What do you do, Sam? I'm-- I'm in the, uh... entertainment field. That's exciting. That's really that, yeah... Which-- which part? Well I'm more of a... I'm an entertainment fixer, really. Eight pounds please, Mary. Thank you. Thank you. Well, it was a pleasure to meet you, Sam. You have impeccable taste, but I'd better get back to my Lord and Master, so I'll see you boys. See you. Bye. Amazing... She is amazing. Entertainment fixer. All right, I was nervous. What's the story with the watch then? That looks real. Yeah, it is, it's a guest's. Morgan sent me out to get it altered. Guess where? Yeah, I like it. Argh, screw you... What was I meant to say? "Oh, actually Mary I'm a bag carrier and general bitch to the rich." Nah, you wouldn't wanna tell her the truth, would you? Imagine if Morgan saw you wearing that? You want something to eat? No, I'm not hungry anymore. Must be love. She's stunning. Are you still around? Right, well you owe me. Yeah, I have a special request. I'm gonna do it, you know. I'm gonna ask her out. Right. Right. Well, go on then. Go and conquer. Right, I bloody will. Hi, I just got there, Mr. Morgan. I had to stop and get something to eat. I haven't had a chance all day. I'll be back as soon as it's done. Yeah. Shit. So if you want something all you have to do is ask, right? What could be more simple? Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Please. Beautiful. Flawless rose diamonds. Commissioned in 1845 in Venice and survived the sinking of The Titanic. Unlike its owner. Stunning. Are you looking for anyone in particular, sir? Uh, no, I'm just, uh, browsing, thank you. How much is this piece? The necklace, sir? 430,000. 430, right. Would you like to see it? No, I'll just carry on looking round if that's okay? Of course. Everything alright Mrs. Lieberman? Perfect, thank you, Charlie. Very good... Malcolm. Hey, Charlie. Hello. You came to see us. I did. So anything catch your eye? Definitely. Really? Get the p... the p... p... The what? Butterfly, the fucking butterfly... It's over there! Get down... Hands on your head. Get out. Get out! Where do you think you're going? I said he can go, we don't need him. I'll be the judge of that. He set off the alarm. Shut up! Who exactly do you think you're gonna sell that to? No one's gonna fence it for you, you know. You really haven't thought this through have you? Bloody children. It's like trying to steal the bloody Mona Lisa! Shut the fuck up! Everything's gonna be all right, Mrs. Lieberman. Right, let's go. What the fuck? Fuck! Freeze! Come on, come on! Shutters. Shutters!!! Top right of the door. Fuck, fuck! Jesus... Argh... Argh, oh, God please. Argh, fuck! They fucking shot me! They fucking shot me! Quit your moaning. Keep an eye on this lot. It's gone clean fucking through. I'm gonna pass out. I feel sick. Fuck... I need help, Cameron. What are we gonna do? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I need to go to hospital. Is there a way out, Cameron? You know how this works here right? You don't want this to end in tears, right? How do we get out? There isn't a way out. Have you got the remotest idea what you're doing? I'm going to shoot you. Go on then, son, shoot me! Stop talking about it and get on with it. Stop it! Ah! They shot me, Cameron. Yeah, yeah, yeah... That's what guns are for, Clegg. Well, get us a towel or something before I bleed to death. Yeah, alright, yeah, yeah, keep your fucking hair on. Cameron and Clegg, are you joking? Do I look like I'm fucking joking? This is the police. Please evacuate the area. They've killed Mrs. Lieberman. Why did I come in here, why? Fucking typical! Idiot! Game's up for these two now. What's with the death wish? These animals show up. No respect. Kill an innocent woman. My friend. I know, I know. Everything you're saying is completely true, but it's not gonna help us right now. Yeah, it's best if you keep out of it. Keep out of it. Who are you to tell me anything? Shut up! And keep it shut! What's that for? Somewhere a little more private for our clients. Hmmm. Somewhere a little more private for you three, eh? 'Cause you lot are getting in my way. Speak to them. We've got hostages so nothing silly. What do we want? F-f-fucking useless I should've left you outside. I'm sorry. This is all new to me. Yeah. This is my first armed robbery. You don't say. This is my first gun, I only bought it yesterday and it's just bought me an extra ten years. More like 20 you're an accessory to those two, you know. "Walk in the park," you said. Keep your nerve. You might need to use that thing next time because they certainly will. I'm in enough shit already. Any names yet? Do we know how many hostages are in there? Jesus, there's enough of them. Well they take these things very seriously, Clegg. Does it even bother ya? Not particularly. Well I don't wanna go back to prison. Well, you are. Now shut up and let me think. Charlie. Charlie don't. Show some respect. Shut up. Show some respect, you miserable cowards. You can't kill me, son. I'm dead already. Mad bastard. I bought that vase for Clara in Paris. She used to love flowers. Excuse me. Just so we're on the same page. I will shoot all of you if I need to. I find it very easy. Understand? Yeah, yeah, we do. What you looking at? Nothing, nothing, I-- I just, I... I just what? I just thought you, you sounded... nothing. You wanna watch it. That kind of thinking will get you into trouble. Shall I tell them that you're a bit busy? Come on, Clegg, hurry up. Gimme your phone. Come on, hurry up. Where's your phone? I don't have one. What, you never seen one before? No. Right, get a move on. You need to make a call. Take control. Private jet abroad? You are fucking with me. Way too much TV. Start with a reduced sentence. Negotiate. Who am I talking to? Well, Inspector Peyton listen to what I gotta say and no interruptions. You got some thinking to do because we won't be sending anybody out of here in one piece without good reason. We've got a number of hostages. Yeah, you need to come back with a plan that gets us out of here with a minimum inconvenience. Three years would do us. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got an hour. What do ya think of that? Don't hold your breath. It'll give them something to think about, but we need a plan B. What's your plan? Sorry? You come in here all smash and grab and it backfires. So what's your backup plan? You don't have one do you? Ooh, she's got a te-- te-- temper. Never you mind. Just hope our plans include you three. No because we have a right to know! What are you gonna do with Mrs. Lieberman's body? She has relatives. Stop it... Stop asking them. What do you think you're possibly gonna achieve? You're just gonna make things worse. Worse? Please, enough. Mary. Maybe I won't shoot you though. You may want to stick your head in the sand... I like to know what people are planning to do with me. Is that okay? Come and sit down Mary. Cameron, Cameron. Cameron! What? Can you help me find some painkillers? Headache tablets, anything for this fucking pain. Find something to tie them up with. Not exactly Vicodin, but it might just take the edge off. What about these? Perfect. False. And about a foot thick. I wonder where it goes to. Or if there's a copper on the other side with stethoscope. You, come here. What do you want with him? Never you mind. I'll be fine. What you doing? Just keeping myself busy. I've got an appointment at seven to get my jabs done. Do you think we'll be out of here by then? No, I don't. Oh. Are you going away? Yeah, I'm um... yeah, next month. I'm going to India, Thailand and Australia. In that order. That sounds good. How long are you going for? I-- I dunno, I wasn't really planning on coming back. Fucking marvelous. Oh, don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. Is Charlie in the... Where is Charlie? I-- I'll find out. Are you sure? She was constantly looking at what other shops were doing. Learning what worked, what didn't. What do you want? Mary was worried about Charlie. We're all worried about Ch-Charlie. Get on with it, will ya. Well, she knew that we had to work very hard to make people go that extra distance. "God is in the detail," she said. Everything has to have a story. Come on, hurry up! Well, we were doing very well. So she designed a refit, an expansion. It was to enhance the image, oh, May 1975. Get to the point. Well, we decided to expand into here. To create some new office space. And part of that expansion was to move the old fire exit from that wall there to the corridor where it is now. In between the false ceiling and the existing one is a gap that tracks back to that fire exit. And that door opens out into a... disused little courtyard. Full of policemen! That fire exit doesn't exist on the plans. And in that courtyard, is a door that opens up into an alleyway. Yeah, which runs parallel to the whole length of Bury Street. Take a right, you come out on King Street and you'll be on your way. He's right. Hmmm. He does have a use then. You got any tools? Well, only those on the desk there, they're tools of the trade, hardly industrial. That's our plan B then. This all you got? Jesus, good luck. Can't help you on this one. Bollocks. All right let's get back and see what the inspector's come up with. Yeah, good luck. Bag up some more of them jewels, now that we're not gonna be hanging around much longer. Those pieces will only draw attention to yourself. Let me worry about that. Go on. Ow. That you Inspector? You know what we're capable of. I don't want your help. I want what we asked for! We gonna be alright, Charlie? You bet we are. It's simple enough... Jesus! Just get a move on! They're fucking with us, Cameron! The inspector's fucking with us! I don't need a doctor! Your wife. She sounded pretty amazing. I don't want your help. I want what we asked for. Stupid fucking thing! Come on. You'd better get back to us. I'm not kidding you, Inspector. You know people generally come in here for something special. Very special. And expensive. Horrible word "expensive." Great thought went into all of these things. They're proclamations of love, promises of eternity. They're about the most precious moments in life. I bet the price tags in here are pretty tasty though. I didn't get your name, son. I'm Sam. Sam Smith. He's an entertainment fixer. You know each other? We met in the cafe around the corner about half an hour before this happened. And what exactly does an entertainment fixer do, Sam? More of a broker really. I get clients for entertainment events. Sounds like a high flying job for one so young. That would explain what you were doing in here of course, checking out my tasty price tags? Yeah, well, Mary said I should come and check out the shop. Yeah. I bet you wish you hadn't clapped eyes on me now. Are you sure it was my jewelry you came to see today, Sam? Jesus Christ! Fuck! You really haven't thought this through. So what's your back up plan? "Walk in the park," you said. You don't have one do you? You come in here all smash and grab and it backfires... Do we have to listen to this old shit? Surprisingly good taste for psychopath. Start with you then shall we? Sam Smith. Take your watch off. And you, old, man take off your watch. You work at the Mandarin Oriental? Yeah, I guess. You guess? You know John Morgan? Yeah, I work for him. Ah, well, John Morgan's... John Morgan is a man who can magic up tables in exclusive restaurants out of thin air. Yeah, for a price. I should think someone like him is like gold dust. He's sent some people in my direction over the years. I bet that cost you. No... I don't need John Morgan to fill my shop up with customers. Are you any relation to the Sam I met in the caf or... Argh, look I exaggerated little. I'm sorry. He's just ambitious, Mary. They all are these days. Just wanna make it big without actually doing anything. Ambition's fine I just-- I don't like liars. I grew up with a phoney, they don't change. Ever. Alright? What do you think? Can you help me here, Sam? I'm a little confused. That's a ten grand watch on a kid with a fifteen grand job? Doesn't stack up, does it? It's not my watch. You're kidding? Busted. Classic... You're full of absolute shit, aren't you? Yeah. Whose it belong to then? It's a guest's. I was taking it to get altered for them. I knew it was one of mine. It's a beautiful example. American lady, yes. Sent by the same John Morgan. That's a nice watch. Is that yours? Very nice. You like it? Oh, it's lovely. Oh, I suppose there's no point in arguing is there? It's a gift, you see. Correct. You have everything. Happy now? Yeah. Ecstatic. At least that watch wasn't yours, Sam. Yeah, right. You obviously don't know my boss very well then. Could you tell me where Sergeant Bryant is, please? Just over there, sir. Thank you. Sergeant Bryant? That's right. John Morgan from the Mandarin Oriental. How can I help you, sir? Well, sergeant I know you have a situation on your hands, but I have some very important guests coming to the hotel for talks. Now the traffic that this has created means that we may miss them altogether. Now the Deputy Commissioner seems to think you might be able to help us out a little. I can put you in touch with their driver, whose number is on my card. Of course. Er, just wait there for a minute, sir. I'll see what I can do okay? Thank you, Sergeant. And I thought you might have come to see how Sam was doing? I'll take a portion of the spaghetti pomodoro, please. And I'll have it to eat in. So what were they after? They came very specifically for the Stahl Papillon. A diamond butterfly brooch. Is that particularly special? Napoleon had it made for mistress. Maria Theresa De Stahl. It's stunning. How much is it worth? A million and change. A million... Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace... Why not let them go? I mean everything in here must be well insured. If I knew somebody was going to die I would have. But it means more to me than a check from an insurance company. Yeah, but you were gonna sell it anyway, so what's the difference? What's the difference? Napoleon had it commissioned in 1807 from a jewelry designer in Paris named Charmier. He showed him a portrait of Maria Theresa and asked him to create something that would compliment the dark green of her eyes. He loved her, you see. It is exquisite and flawless... In every way. The flutter of her heart would cause its wings to flutter and fly away to freedom. The collector sold it to me because she knew I'd find it every bit as beautiful as she did. Look after it for a while and keep the story alive. How long's that gonna take you? I don't know, why don't you come and... Okay, okay this is it, we've gotta get out of here. What? Oh, Jesus. Watch how much of that you drink. I don't want you going all fucking stupid. All right, all right. Yes. Come on. Ugh. Sam! Time to come in now. I'll blow her fucking head off! Oh, shit. Come back in and put the shutters down. Clegg, what's going on out there? You were so lucky that was me that found you. If anything happens again I will kill you. What's going on? Just a little bit of misunderstanding. Right. No! Hey, what's happened? They've put a body out on the street. Any details? A lady in her sixties apparently. Are you in the least bit concerned? Oh, yes, I am. He's got a very expensive watch on him that belongs to a guest of mine. I'll have a coffee, please. Filter. Milk on the side. You see what happens? You see? Now have we got your attention, Inspector? Well let's hope we can keep it. The clock's ticking. Don't force our hand again. Don't even fucking think about it, Clegg. Where are you from, Sam? Camden. Where abouts? Jubilee Street. I grew up on Clark Street. You're kidding. It's tough when you've got nothing, I know. Well you've got plenty now. Have I? You've just got to work out what you want, Sam. And if all you want is to get enough to come on spending spree in here, you've missed the point son. No, I don't-- I didn't. That's not what it was about. Really? Oh, forget it, you're right. I get out here, I need to go to the loo. What's going on? Shh. Cameron? Are you okay? Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. No, you... you leave her where she is. No, no, please... No, please You just leave her where she is. Get your hands off her. Please leave... I'm warning you, son. No, please leave... no, please, please... You leave her alone! Get off of her you bloody mad bastard! Violent piece of shit! What are you doing? Please leave me alone, please leave me alone. Sorry. Please... What are you doing? Please. I mean, you need her tied up right? That's the only way you'll ever get that close. Please, please, please, please. Are you doing this 'cause you can't string a sentence together? I mean, you can't get your name out of your mouth. Just can't get the words out, can you? How can you ever tell woman how you feel? You just can't get the words out, can you? That must make you angry. I'm sorry. She's never gonna fall for you, you're an imbecile. Yeah, an imbecile. Imbecile. Imbecile. No, stop it! You can't do that. It's wrong. I'm gonna untie you, I'm gonna let you go for a minute. Sort yourself out, I'm sorry. Sam. Sam. Sam. That was really brave. Yeah, my dad used to knock my mum around when he'd had a skin full. It's not right. I mean we got rid of him eventually, but he's my dad, you know? You only get one. I'm sorry about that, Sam. Do you think it'll be better than here? Where? Wherever you're going. Yeah. I said no delays. I don't wanna be your friend. Now tell me how long it's gonna be before you have something to offer us. I don't care who you have to speak to. Look you know what'll be coming out the front door if this carries on, don't ya? You said that every piece of jewelry in here has its own story. I'm bored of talking! You lot only ever take notice of crisis. No, fuck you! One of us is gonna get killed. No, they're not gonna kill anyone else. If this is a game of nerve, Inspector, then, you got it wrong, wrong, wrong! Fucking wrong. Fuck! Fuck, Fuck! So these stories... clever marketing, you know. They the way to spice things up? Add a bit of drama? No, no, not, not at all. Well, let's hear one of them then. Tell me your favorite story. Okay, um... Well, there's this ruby piece that has a pretty amazing story to it. I'm all ears. Go on, Mary. Tell it. Well it's an exquisite ruby and diamond bracelet. And it was made in 1815. Fuck off... Fuck! Fucking hell! We're waiting. So, it's the early and there's this daughter, of a duke and she is the most beautiful girl, ever. She's like a pin up. I've got you. And her father, the duke, he's the most powerful man around apart from the King. So, in short... she's a big catch, and the suitors are literally lining up, all around the block. The duke, he knows exactly who he wants her to marry and at first she's all right with, with dad's choice. He's some young guy who's probably lined up to be a duke himself. He would be, wouldn't he? Of course. Well one day, she's introduced to his best friend and he's not lined up to be a duke or anything. But they get talking, one night at dinner round her place. A banquet? Quite right. And all the boys, young and old... ... get drunk as lords. Of course they do. But our guy... he sits up and he talks to the girl who's called Ruby till it's light outside. You know he, he listens to her. And he wants to know about her life. And he makes her laugh. And she goes to bed and she realizes for the first time that she has feelings for a man and she can't sleep, because her heart is... is beating. "I am confused and euphoric in equal measure." That's what she wrote in her diary. Oh the, the men, they're away the whole time 'cause they're fighting the French. And whenever her husband is due to be home he always seems to bring his best friend back with him. And so their relationship develops And he stays up to talk with her 'til late. And they go riding together. Well, everybody just thinks he's being a good sort. The wedding date is set, but a couple of weeks beforehand the men are called away to Belgium. To fight in the battle of... Waterloo. Waterloo. Exactly. And the night before they go. The best friend and Ruby they have a-- a few moments together. And he tells her he's just in love with her. But he can never be with her because he can't betray his best friend. And he says he wishes her nothing but happiness. And then he kisses her goodbye. And he holds her for just a moment. Man, that's tough. It's tragic. So wait for this. At waterloo... well, the men they're fighting hand to hand. And the duke, the young duke, he's about to be put to the sword when his best friend saves him, but he's killed in the process. Isn't that amazing? You see he could have come home. He could have come home and rightfully claimed Ruby's hand, But he chose instead to save the life of his friend and give his own life. It's just amazing. Well, what about the bracelet? You may well ask. Two days after she heard about the death and how he saved her husband to be. Parcel arrives... and it's the bracelet. From the best friend. From the man that she loved. Wow. A couple of weeks after the wedding. Ruby's wearing the bracelet. It's this bracelet. And she realizes there's an inscription on the inside of the band. What did it say? It says "For Ruby..." "... for love..." "... forever." Isn't that beautiful? Yeah, It is. I think it's just heartbreaking story. Charlie ruined it for me a couple of months before by telling me that the young duke, he brought something back from Belgium himself. Namely chronic syphilis. But I choose not to include that in my version. Having fun? Oh, Jesus. Not again leave her alone. Please, you can take anything but not that. Please, you can take anything. Please, don't take that. No, please. What can I say? I'm a... magpie. It's only a bracelet. It was much more than that, Charlie. I know. They said they'd call us, right? How are you gonna get me up through the ceiling? Hey, fellas. Argh, not you again. What is it? Can I suggest that we order some medical supplies? And while we're at it, I don't know about anyone else but I'm starving. Ah, what do you fancy? Chinese, Thai, maybe a pizza? Well, now you come to ask, there's a place just around the corner that does the best and I mean the very best pasta. Are you serious? Ask for the mushroom risotto... It's today's special. Oh really, Mushroom Risotto? Oh, it's wild mushroom, actually. Oh, I'm sorry. Fucking risotto. Good. I'm starving, let's order. Whatever makes you happy Cameron. Mushroom risotto. Good work. Good work, Sam. You handled that very well. Yeah, don't sound too surprised. Could you really eat something right now? Yeah. Best thing to do is eat yourself out of a crisis. That's a very feminine thing to do. Yeah, well, I like to think that it lurks within me. Four portions of wild mushroom risotto. One portion of spaghetti pomodoro and throw in some bread, salad and plenty of water. Er, nothing. It'll be my pleasure, Officer. It's a good sign isn't it? They're hungry. Excuse me. What do you want? Er, I need to use the lavatory. That'll have to wait. Well, if it wasn't urgent I wouldn't be asking. Jesus. You take him. Or you could untie us. Charlie could take care of himself and you have to untie us soon to let us eat. Any trouble you can blame me. Not blame you. Shoot you. Okay hold it in. You'll have to wait until we've finished this call. You sorted it? It's very simple, Inspector. Have you sorted it? Then you better find the Home Secretary hadn't you? I swear that sounded like compliment. It's not my problem. You be careful with those all right? Thanks. Right off you go, no funny business. Thank you. He's having a rough time. He was with Clara for forty-five years and he's having to learn how to be alone. And it's not easy. You just saved him his dignity though. Well I was thinking more about us, sitting next to him for the next twelve hours to be honest. Well, let's hope it doesn't go on for another 12 hours, eh? Amen to that. What? Nothing. I know you, Sam Smith. And I know you know me. If you say a word or show in any way that you know me I'll kill you, understand? I don't know what you mean. You heard me. One word or a nod or anything else and I will kill you because you'll be a witness and if I don't he certainly will. I don't know you. Don't try me. Grub's up! "Vici!" Thanks, Officer. "Vici." Yeah, damn right, "Vici." Right, what did you just say? I said, "Vici." "Vici," what the fuck is that? It was to let my best friend know I was all right. He works at the caf just around the corner. It's just a saying we had. I'm watching you, Sam. These pills better work. Oh, God. Argh, that ain't right. Now that... that is something else. How you two can even think about eating anything now is beyond me. Well, a very good risotto is a very rare thing and this... ... makes the heart sing. Yeah, the chef's a talented boy. What, you know who cooked this? Yeah, my oldest friend. What the kid in the coffee shop round the corner? Yeah, my brother Elliot. Mmm, he's good. Mm-hmm. You know Elliot and I... we always had this dream that we'd set up a restaurant together. You know, simple Italian but just getting the basics to be brilliant. He's always wanted to be a chef and I've always been interested in the business side. That's why I started working at the hotel. Get some experience, see what works and what doesn't. Oh, yeah, that's, that's something isn't it? That is delicious. When we were at school, I mean Elliot got this obsession with cooking. I mean, it gave the bullies some ammunition but he just loved to cook. Elliot just understands the chemistry. You know, how to put things together. Doesn't he just. It's about getting the whole thing right, the concept, simple daily menu with seasonal ingredients. It's about getting the pricing right, location right. About giving Elliot the best possible chance to make his dreams come true. Your dream too Sam. It's all about the detail Charlie. Isn't it just? You've done a lot of work on your mate's dream, haven't you? This Elliot is he a Camden boy, too? Yep, born two days after me, two floors below me. Ah, ha-ha. Hot bed of talent, eh, Mary? When I was-- when I was 12, my mum, she couldn't cope so she-- she left me with Elliot's mum. And she sort of became my mum. I'm no doctor but I'll try and clean this up a bit. Can I ask you where she went Sam? Ah yeah, Australia. And have you heard from her since? No. Let me see. Oh, thank you. You know Sam... I reckon we're more alike than you'd like to think. Yeah, well I wish I was a little more successful... like you. In time. I think he's got a good heart, don't you, Mary? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. You know Mary... You've always been there for me. You're a wonderful girl. I'm gonna miss you very much when you go. I never tried to stop you because otherwise I, an old man just... getting in your way. Charlie. You should, er, you should ask Mary out you know, Sam. Really? Yeah, get to know her a little, before she takes off. No. Okay. I get the picture. I'm gonna stretch my legs. What's up with you? I know you're part of all this. What? I heard you, Sam. You know Clegg, Clegg knows you. Shh... Alright, please be quiet. Of course I don't know him. Well, then why would he say that he did know you? And why would he try to let you go when they first got in here? They've put you in here as plant haven't they? So if they get arrested the jewels get out anyway. It's very clever. Look you're gonna get us killed. He said to me he knows me and I know him, but if I mention another word he'd kill me. I'm begging you, please be quiet. I saw you put the brooch in your pocket. Yeah, I picked it up to keep it safe for Charlie, I know how much it means to him and I wouldn't put it past those nutcases to smash it to pieces. You've got me all wrong. Why would my face look like this if I was a part of it all? Because it's very convincing to the police. Argh, you've got to believe me, Mary. Why? Why would I ever believe you? What were you even doing in here in the first place? You're a fucking liar. To see you, okay, to ask you out on a date. Okay, I got tickets for the gig next week. The song you were whistling to in the caf. I got tickets to see them. I wanted to see if you'd come with me. Oh, what, you magicked up two tickets in the few minutes that you actually had. I'm begging you please believe me. I am not lying. And I wanna live long enough to maybe take you. How did you get the tickets? Entertainment fixer remember-- Now please shut up. What's with all the whispering? I was scared. And I wanted reassuring. What did you tell her, Sam? I'd like to know because I'm a bit scared, too? I told her that everything would be all right... and to believe me when I told her that. Ah, well, thank God, it's gonna be alright. 'Cause there was me getting all worried. Promise me you won't say anything. Well, it's not just you that likes them anyway. I mean, I like them, I woulda got the tickets anyway. Yeah? Yeah, I'm a big fan. Really? # There goes my hero # Watch him as he goes See? That was awful. You deserve to be shot. Fair enough. I'm gonna trust you because I have to. Come over here and I'll have a look at that thick head of yours. Lying bastard. Fuck! Oh, dear. What? I think I may have misled Mr. Cameron somewhat. Oh, great. I'm gonna kill someone now. Someone is about to die. Papillon. Papillon. Papillon, papillon. Papillon. I am coming to shoot someone. Inspector. You have failed to deliver and I am bored, bored, bored with your delaying tactics. You have precisely five minutes from the end of this phone call to come back with a firm and acceptable offer or someone else will die. Goodbye. And they're off. What's up Clegg, eh? Cat got your tongue? What are you thinking? Enough bloody thinking. Time for some doing. You obviously all heard my short conversation with the inspector. If they don't come back with something in the next five minutes I'm gonna shoot one of you. And just so you have a few minutes to prepare yourselves It'll be you! No! No take me... I'm the one that lied to you. Too easy. You're gonna live to see the consequences of your actions. Do you believe me now? Yes. You shouldn't go away. Why not? 'Cause being on your own somewhere else wont make it any better. Why are you saying this now? Because I think if you found someone you could trust you would stop running. I took a chance today, you should too. How long have I got, Charlie? About three minutes, I think. Shit. Yes, Inspector? Wrong answer, Inspector. Wrong answer. Get up. No, take me. Don't you worry, I'm sure we'll get round to you, but right now this mocking imbecile's time has come. On your feet now! Get off him, you bastard! Oh, my God! Move! Go on, shoot me, you bastard. Up against the wall. You know what'll happen, don't you? Enlighten me. You shoot me and they'll come in and shoot the pair of you. Oh, really? They didn't exactly send in the cavalry when they thought she was popped did they? Well what about the negotiation? Negotiation... how many of those pills did you take? I'll make it quick. No, stop it Cameron! On your knees! Stop it, let him go! Look, we need to talk this through. What, with you? Go on, shoot me, you psycho bastard! On your knees or I will shoot you where you stand. Stop it! You can't kill him. I can't let this happen. It's just wrong. Wrong? You're not gonna shoot anyone you dopey cripple. Watch me. See... I took all the bullets out. Now... stay down. I suppose you'll be wanting this then? You bastard! Great fucking disguise, Carl. You alright, Sam? Carl... Who's Carl? Carl Thomas. Elliot and I were at school with him. He was like the school psycho. Terrorized us. Will you put in a good word for me, Sam? Are you kidding me? Hello. Oh, hello, Inspector. Yeah, it no-- it's over. Yes, this is Charlie. Charlie Morgan. Morgan? How's that then? It's delicious. How are you? It's been quite day. I know all about your idea for the restaurant. Oh, yeah? It'll probably always just be an idea, but... There you go. He really admires you, you know. Sam. Yeah? Yeah. Jesus, man, what? How did that go? I gave mitigating evidence for Carl Thomas. Son of bitch. Can you believe I tried to help him? They should throw away the keys, man. Carl Thomas. What a fuck-up. Want something to eat? I got to eat the mushroom risotto. I had to be taken hostage but I got to eat it. And...? Lovely, lovely. I've got room for something else. Yeah, well, you sit there and I'll fetch you something. Well, there's a thing. Smith. Mr. Morgan. You got something for me? You were there for five hours and you still couldn't manage to get the bracelet altered? But Mr. Morgan, I don't know if you know, I got caught in a heist this afternoon. Well, if you'd have gone straight to the shop as I asked you'd have got the watch back on time. As it is, I have a guest that is most unhappy. I'm going to have to let you go, Smith. Are you serious? Yes. I am. Thanks, John. Give me five minutes? Sure. Shouldn't you be lying down or something? You cheeky bugger. What's that? That is pumpkin tortellini in tomato sauce. You like the look of it? If it's anything like the risotto it's gonna be all right isn't it? It's every bit as good. Oh, thank you. So he tells me you're a great cook, Elliot. I try. My word. Delicious. Thanks. So have you got a name for this restaurant of yours then? Yeah, "Vici." "Vici?" "Vici." Yeah, I like it. I came, I saw... Yeah, I know what "vici" means, Sam. Well, you're brother sacked me. He bloody sacked me. Well, it depends how you see it, Sam. You could argue that he just set you free. Yeah. You know, that I told you that my wife was the clever one? Yeah. When she believed in something, she, she went for it. Like when this street took off. She put all of our profits into buying more property. Like this place. You get me the budget by Monday... And it makes sense to my accountant. And you... better be as good as he says because I want a handsome return on my investment. Are you serious? Deadly. For you. We're all gonna miss you, Mary. I can't. You tell that story far better than I do. That's because I've heard you tell it a hundred times. Charlie? Hmm? Would you mind if I stick around for a while? Not at all. I'll see you bright and early in the morning. There's a lot to get on with. Yeah, and I want 51% of the business. You're on. Amazing. Tell you what though? What? You're a shit negotiator. You all right, Charlie? Yeah. Yeah, I am all right, Johnny. I'm all right. Good. Have you still got the tickets to the concert? Yeah. Ask me. # Ooh, look at that # Look at her walking # Turning my head # Taking my breath away # Look at her walking # Turning my head # Taking my breath away # Oh, take a look at that # Look at her walking # Turning my head # Taking my breath away # Come to me #
