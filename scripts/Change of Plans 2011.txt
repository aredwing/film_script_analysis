By the way, we've been married for five years. What? I just love you so much. I can't wait to go on vacation. Yeah, I'm here for the NAA Collier ceremony thing. You know... - Yes, ma'am. ID? - Sure. Wow! F-22 Raptor. That's my favorite. Nice little fighter jet. - Yes, ma'am. - Thanks. Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm just kind of in a rush here. Excuse me. Hey. How you all doing today? On behalf of the National Aeronautic Association, for his ground-breaking new and far safer design of a diffuser for the scramjet engine, it is my honor to present Jason Danville with the prestigious Collier Trophy. Way to go, baby! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to thank General Lindford and the National Aeronautic Association, and most importantly, I'd like to thank my wife Sally. Before I was an aeronautical engineer, I was an Air Force pilot. In fact, I even flew in a few of these events. And we used to joke that we weren't in the Air Force, we were in show business. And you know what the first rule of entertainment is? Show, don't tell. - I'm so syked to go to Tahiti. - Yeah. Best diving in the world. Seriously, wall-to-wall coral. Haven't been there since I was a kid, but apparently the oceanic drop-offs at Tahiti Nui are supposed to be absolutely stunning. I'm serious. The most serious man I know. - Come on. - Let's get out of here! - All right, sweetie, are you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready. Really? - Yeah, I'm excited. - This is going to be great. - Are you packed? - Of course. Well, you know, sort of. Not really, but... Happy anniversary, baby. I love you. Forget about it. Don't answer that. We're out of here, sweetie. Hello. All right, are you ready? Sal? What is it? What happened? Yeah. No, that's right. Uh-huh. Thank you. We appreciate it and, yes, happy skies to you, too. All right, well, we're good with insurance. We just have to use the tickets within a year. So young. Can't believe it. She was my mentor. My oldest friend, you know. Could have been mechanical failure, fog, turbulence, they're not sure. This is Africa. - How's that? - Oh, it's just an expression. This is Africa, a place where you rarely find out how a thing happens or why... - The point is, there were no survivors. - Yes, that's the point. Scott will fill you in on the legal implications and then I'll follow up with the practical applications. Okay, okay, can we... What about this application or implications or what? Teresa and her husband Frank left four children. Peace Corps brought them back to the U.S. A month ago. Wait. You're not going where I think you're going. Are you? This is their final will. And right here... That's your name, isn't it? Yeah, I haven't... I haven't seen her in... That was a long time ago and her daughter was just two... Of possible guardians, the immediate families are out. Parents have passed away, Frank was an only child, Teresa's sister is on her second tour in Afghanistan. You were next in line. Teresa and Frank believed that if anything should happen, they could entrust you with the care of their kids. Well, something has happened. Excuse me, Dorothy, right? Of the Ohio Family... I'm sorry, this is just... This is a lot to take in all at once... It is the Ohio Center of Family Protection, and it's on the card that I gave you. Right, right, right. Okay, so here's the thing. Tezzie's my oldest friend. I would do anything in the world for her, but the truth is, we're completely unsuited to be parents. I mean, not even to take the kids. We have careers, we travel, we barely even have time for each other. And kids, not in the playbook. Playbook? - You know what I mean. - Yeah, I can't cook. I mean, I can't. I don't know the first thing about kids or what to do with them. That's two of us. Nobody is trying to force you to be parents... All right, then, I guess that's that. And I don't suppose you'd be interested in seeing them. Wait, they're here? Little Jordan... They were brought in two weeks ago from D.C. They're staying in a group home. Okay, so you just assumed that we'd take them. Frankly, yes. As per your commitment to your friend. My wife and I would like to have a private conversation, please. Yes, of course. Wow. - I can't believe this is happening. - Heavy. - I can't believe this is happening... - Very interesting. - Honestly... - No. No way we can adopt four kids. No way. This is just not who we are. - I know. You're telling me? - I feel terrible. They're right. I have an obligation. I have an obligation... - Maybe there's something... - What? What? I don't know. I mean, they're kids. We're not going to feel good about ourselves unless we do something, right? And maybe we do something... - Temporarily. - Temporary? - Yeah, until they find a real home. - A real family. Right, a real family. It'd be better than a group home. Yeah. I hope. And that's little Jordan? Impressive young lady. Hasn't smiled much since she's been here, but then who could blame her? The tiny one is Sung Lee. She was adopted from China when she was a year old. Javier is 15, born in Guatemala. He was abandoned when he was three and ended up on the streets. Teresa and Frank adopted him five years ago. And the boy is Kaleb, adopted in Uganda when he was four. Jordan. Hi, I'm Sally. I'm so sorry about your parents. Thank you. I loved your mother very much. So did we. Hi. - I'm Kaleb. - Hi, Kaleb, I'm Sally. It's wonderful to meet you. - Hi. - Hi, Sung Lee, I'm Sally. I was your mommy's good friend. - This is Javier. - Hi, Javier. - Hello. - It's good to meet you. You must be Jordan. I'm Jason. Hi. That troublemaker must be Kaleb, huh? I'm not a troublemaker. All right, throttle back. I was just kidding. So you're all going to come and stay with us. Would you like that? Yes. Yes. Yes. Hey, you. How are those bunk beds coming along? Oh, you know, academy, MIT, Collier Trophy... - What could possibly go wrong? - Yeah, right. Yeah, what could go wrong? Jason, how are we going to do this? I mean, even for a week? I... My mom, you know, she was great. I don't know how she did it. I just didn't pay attention, I guess. - Guess I was just so focused on myself... - I know. Tell me about. All I wanted to do is fly, and once I did, I never looked back. That's them. They're here. Hi, Dorothy. - Hi, everyone. - Interesting place... Yeah, it's a little tecked out, but it's my studio. - Yeah, we live upstairs. - Uh-huh. Thank you, Auntie Sally. "Auntie" Sally? Ugandan custom. Don't use "Mr." and "Mrs." so much. You've got a lot of stuff. Oh, let's not play that right now. - Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! - All right, I'm letting you go. Why don't we go upstairs? Here. Let me help you with this. Okay, guys, just follow me, all right? See you soon. Thanks, Dorothy. You're welcome, Jordan. Okay, so I have identification, travel visas and medical for you, - and here is information on Uganda. - Oh. Good idea. What are you making? Something resembling a smoothie. And even if this is a temporary arrangement, it's important that they transition as quickly as possible. So I've made appointments for you at two schools in your area, elementary and high school. Great. - I don't want any of that. - Are you sure? It's really good. It makes you all happy inside. You and I both know Jason and I aren't cut out for this. We don't want these kids to get attached, so the sooner we can find them another family, the better. It's not easy to place the four of them together, but I do have some leads, so I'll call you as soon as I can. - Appreciate it. - Thank you. You're welcome. So this looks like an interesting game. What's it called? Omweso. It's the national board game of Uganda. How do you play? You start on your side and you start sowing your seeds. - It's easy. - Doesn't look so easy to me. I always win. - That's because Mom and Dad let you win. - Liar! Look, I think we should get settled in, and then maybe we can think about maybe making some dinner. I have a better idea. Let's just order something in. Great idea. I can help you prepare a meal. No. No, no, it's okay. We'll just order some pizza? Thai or Chinese... Whatever you guys like, we can... Dorothy told us you can't cook. She told you that? I love to cook, especially for my family. I can help you. Even me. In our family, the women always prepare meals together. Okay, well, Jordan, I mean, in America, you know, lately, the whole gender thing, men actually can cook these days. They, like, you know... Yeah. Yeah. Let's... Let's give it a try. Okay, gentlemen, this is it. Your quarters. You got a little washroom over here to the right, you got the bunk beds. Who wants tops? - Me. - You okay with that? Mmm-hmm. All right. We've got exercise cycles, we've got a TV, an Xbox, darts... That's kind of my little work area, so you may want to, you know, play low there. - You like this? - What is it? It's foosball. What's that? Foosball? Foosball is the national table game of America. Wanna learn how to play? - What do you think? - I like this one. Oh! - What? - Okay, 1-0. Ready? Oh! - Kaleb! - All right. Kaleb, how do you like your room? I've never been in a bunk bed before and foosball is fun. I even beat my brother who tells everybody he's the best football player in the whole world. - I don't say that. - Yes, you do. Stop it. All right, well, why don't we eat our hot, delicious omelets? Can we say grace? Absolutely. Yeah, sure. Of course. May God preserve us from all harm and may He hold our mom and dad in His embrace. May He bless this food to nourish us that we may work in His service. Amen. - Amen! - Amen. Amen. Come on, boys, under the covers. - What is that? - That's my work. What work is it? I design engines. I love engines. - Even me. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. - Hey, hey, guys, it's late. Hey! Let's go to sleep, all right? - Good night, boys. - Good night. Good night, Major Jason. Good night. Can I have a tell-me-something? Hmm? What's a "tell-me-something"? - I'll do it. - No, no, no. - I'd like to try. What is it? - Tell her about anything. She'll get into it. Okay, so what would you like me to tell you about? Mmm. When you and Mommy were best friends. Well, when me and your mommy were best friends, we used to sing together a lot, mostly at the hospital for little kids, but I remember this one time when we went and sang at the zoo. What's a zoo? In America, it's a place where we keep all the animals so that we can go see them. We found out that there was a sick zebra, so your mom said, "Let's go sing to it." - That's funny. - Yup, it is. Did you know that the zebra was your mommy's most favorite animal in the whole world? That's why we went and sang to it. We had a song... Zebra, zebra, zebra Please get better. Zebra, zebra, you're okay. And guess what, that zebra was better the next day. And everyone at the zoo thought your mommy was a very special person. They were right, weren't they? Okay. Good night. I miss my mommy. I know, sweetie. She went away. But when she comes back, I'm going to give her a lot of presents. Want to see? That's very beautiful. It's because my mommy is special. What are you doing? Come here, you'll see. You should not do this. It does not belong to you. - Look. - It's our school. Let me see! Let me see! Tell me, little brother, am I the best football player in the world? Yes, yes! The very best! In all of history? Uh-huh, in all of history. Better than everyone. Now let me see. There. You know that place? It's our home. - Good morning, beautiful girl. - Good morning. Hey, listen. They gotta go to school. School, right. No. I mean we gotta take them. Oh, right, we gotta take them. Yeah, I knew that. No, listen. What are they gonna eat? We gotta make them breakfast. Have you thought about breakfast? - What are we going to do? - I got it all taken care of. Yeah? Okay, then let's do... Okay, then let's go. Let's... Let's... Look out. - You guys like cars? - Yeah. Especially fast ones. Okay, safety first, don't forget to buckle up. Major Jason, someday can I drive this car? You know how to drive a stick shift? Since I was 8 years old. - Hey, Klay, what's up? - Hey, sweetie, I heard Milwaukee was brilliant. - Yeah, Milwaukee was great. Sold out in... - Yeah. Anyway, - listen I've got a gig on Tuesday. - What's she doing? - Tuesday? - Look at the funny dog. Yeah. I mean, look, everyone loves you. I've told them all about you. Izzy listened to your track, it's fantastic. Look, I've got a few new obligations and I'm just not sure... What do you mean "obligations"? I don't understand. I'm sorry, we just gotta talk about this later. Can we talk about this later? - Okay, fine. Love you, sweetie. - Okay. Yeah, you too. Thanks. Bye. Ooh. Kids, promise me one thing. Do not get jobs that have agents, all right? Must we find jobs now? No, Kaleb. Over here, kids get to be kids. Okay? Okay, Auntie Sally. Auntie Sally. Is something wrong? - Our school before this... - Was smaller. Very much smaller. Welcome to America. Go big or go home. What does he mean by that? I didn't mean "go home," that's just a phrase that we... So, all right, let's go to school. I'm Jordan Solarte. I was born in America, but for the last 11 years... I was in a small school outside Kampala. That's in... ...Uganda. Okay, so Uganda is a land-locked country... ...in Africa. My favorite thing about moving to America is foosball. I love foosball! Where Majid Musisi was born, the most famous football player in the world. My memory about the country where I'm from is... ...war, refugees, displacement camps, poverty, drought, famine, cholera... ...when I helped to catch a chicken... But I really loved it and I miss it a lot. Apologies, ladies and gentlemen. Can you get that? A domestic situation kept me behind the power curve, which means what, Ms. Cochand? - You didn't keep up with your expectation. - Very good. In terms of airspeed, what does that mean, Mr. Brennan? Your airspeed was less than required for the maximum lift-to-drag ratio. Exactly. Remember, the slower you go, the more power you need, which is the case in attempting to get children to school when induced drag begins to increase. Let's see where we left off. We were discussing the principles... I'm looking for Jason Danville. Hold on. Sir, from General Lindford. He requested an immediate response. - Tell him I'll meet him. - Yes, sir. So how are your classes? Okay. - Just okay? - No one ever heard of Uganda. Same here. - Oh! Who's the girl with the blue hair? - In my computer class. Hmm. Javier? We have to go meet Sally. Javier! You're not from around here. What makes you say that? Only highly unusual people would check out the Community Service booth. Everybody is pretty usual around here, so... - I see. Yeah, I'm new. - Cool. - Noah. - Jordan. ...Peace Corps. At least my parents were. - Really? - And I helped out. - Really? That's crazy. Where? Uganda? The Pearl of Africa. You've been there? Actually, just kind of a geography geek. I've never been anywhere, but... Hey, capital cities, GNP, national bird, I'm your man. I like that. A little help, man. So sign up and you can tell me all about how the real world works. Why do you want to know that? Come here. Someday, I'm going to see it all. Here. Let's go, Javier! - Now who is that kid? - Never seen him before. - Javier Solarte. - You know him, do you? No, not yet, but... Guys, guys, listen. Guys, guys, guys! Thank you. Look, does this just not feel right to anybody else? Are we not on the same page here? - I'm not playing slow. - What's happening over here? - I don't know. Is it me? Is it the song? - No. - Sally... - What is it? - Sal, Sal... - What can we do? I... What? It's okay. Sorry. You're right, it is, but I don't know. I don't know what's going on with me lately. I guess I'm just... The kids. Oh, the kids. I forgot... Kids... There's kids... Kids? What's up with kids? She just inherited a whole bunch. Cool, I like kids. - Sorry. - Bye. Guys want to rock a little Xbox downstairs? Yeah. Okay, so your mommy is running just a little bit late this afternoon... Auntie Sally is not our mommy. Oh. Yes. Sorry, of course. But I'd like both of you to stay where I can keep an eye on you. And, Kaleb, - you look after your little sister, okay? - Okay. - I'm not little. - You are so little. - I'm big. - Little. - Big. - Okay. - Are you really a big girl now? - I already told you. If you want, I can tell you a very sad thing, something only a big girl can understand. Do you want me to? Mommy and Daddy are never coming back. Never, ever, ever... - Come here. Come on. - Leave me alone! - No, sweetheart! - Let me go! Sung Lee? What happened? What happened? Sweetie, here. Come here. Tell me, what happened? What's wrong, Sung Lee? What is it? - What happened? - Kaleb told her about Mom and Dad. I told her. Mom and dad are not coming back. Sleepy time now, sleepy time. Asleep, finally. Hey, how was school? American students are different. How's that? Just are. You don't like them? I like them, they're just not serious. - Some are, but mostly not. - Jordan... Are you hungry? You want a bowl of cereal or milk or you can... We can talk or... No, thanks, I'm just going to go to bed. Good night. Good night. Oh, oh, oh, I'm coming around. I'm coming around. Oh, oh! You beat me again. Boys, it's time to go to bed. Come on, let's brush your teeth. Tell him what you did. You must. Tell him. Hey, boys? Boys? It was me who did it. Not Kaleb. If you have a punishment, it should be for me only. You can use my computer whenever you want, but what do you have to do first? - Ask permission. - That's exactly right. Do we all understand that? - Yes, sir. - Yes, Major Jason. Hey, are you asleep? Not even a little. Jason, I can't do this. Look, it's not forever. No, I mean I can't. Like... I don't have any parenting genes or nurturing instincts or something. You know how to love. That's just who you are. If that was all that it took. Listen, Jason. Hey. These kids are hurting and they may not show it yet, but it's only a matter of time until, I don't know, something terrible happens, and then what do we do? We're going to handle it, together. You had it rough over there, I know. But you were born to fly. You know that, too, don't you, son? - That was then, this is now, sir. - You so sure about that? Yes, sir, I am. Let's put it to the test then, shall we? Go on, have a pew. Jason, what if I was to tell you I wanted you back in the cockpit? I gave it up for a reason, sir. As you said, "That was then, this is now." The design team wants you. You can be your own test pilot. The Air Force is looking at the F-35. The F-35 Lightning, that's a... - Outstanding jet fighter is what it is. - Yes, it is. - And highly underestimated. - Yes, it was. It would mean a fair bit of travel, longer stay-overs at Langley. Sally might take issues with it, but you can deploy countermeasures for that, right? Do I have time to consider, sir? All right, talk it over with Sally, but get back to me pronto. By the way, saw Sally at the ceremony. She's still quite the character. Yeah, she's all that, huh? Hey, before you go, a few fellows might want to shake your hand. Jenny. - Babba Everby. - How are you, J? You speed maniac. Bagels, Westskape, Freddy. Look at you, you city slicker. You still driving that old Chevelle? Of course I am. You still doing the NASCAR thing? As much as I can. Not that we're trying to persuade you or anything, Jason. No, no, I'd never suspect that. They're looking for a replacement for the West Coast leg of the tour - and you're the... There you go, Charlie. - I'm what? - Yeah, get down there, sweetie. - Hello! Hi, I'm what? - Get down. Yes, yes. - Excuse me, Klay. You're killing me. I'm what? And you're the one they want. They're there with an offer, so what do you want me to tell them? Look, I told you Milwaukee was great. I'm ready for this, this is it. - Oh, yeah. - Wow. Charlie. Now, really. Really. - Okay, then. - Yeah. - I'll set up the meeting at Macambo. - Great. You never know who is going to be there. So you're saying I should put my game face on. Yeah, yeah, that and do that little "Sally thing" that you do, eh? Okay. Hang on. Hello? Oh, no, is she okay? Yeah, no, I'm on my way. I'm on my way. Thanks. Okay. - Hey, hey, Sally? - Gotta go. Bye, Klay. Sally, where are you going? Oh, oh. I'm sorry, excuse me, could you tell me where the nurse's office is? Thank you very much. - Excuse me, I'm Sally Danville. I... - Yes. - What happened? - Oh, it's all right, Mrs. Danville. - Yeah? Yeah, okay. - She's fine. It's just an earache. - What do I do? - Some warm water, a couple of these drops every four hours. She should be better in the morning, I'm sure. Just a little bit of this... Okay. Want a little "tell me something"? Okay. I'm sorry. - Hey, what's going on down here? - I'm sorry, Auntie Sally. It's okay. I was not paying attention. Can you forgive me? - Yeah. - I'll speak to him. - No, Jordan, can you just let me this time... - No, it should be me. No, my drums, my house, my turn. Please? I guess you like music, huh? - In my country, we have music every day. - Wow, that's fun. I'm sorry I did that. Dude, it's fine. You know what? Curiosity is good. Never lose it. Let's just not worry about this, okay? How would you like to jam with my band? - Can I really? - Yeah. I think I can arrange it, yeah. I'm very ashamed. I told you, it's not a big deal, seriously. I'm not ashamed about these drums. I'm ashamed about what I said to my sister. Look, sit down. Listen, Kaleb, I know you weren't trying to hurt Sung Lee. You were just telling her the truth. Telling the truth is a really hard thing to say. Actually, it takes a lot of courage, which must mean you're pretty brave. It's nothing to be ashamed of, right? All right? - Auntie Sally? - Yeah? I love living here with you and Major Jason. Hi, beautiful girl. Sorry I'm late. I ran into Bobby Everby at the base. Remember him from the squadron? Used to drive NASCAR before he joined the service. - So you were at the base? - Yeah. Met with General Lindford, but I'll tell you about that later. - How was your day? - Wonderful. - No. Not wonderful. - Oh, it sounds complicated. Yeah, it would have been simpler if you were here. All right, what happened? Details don't matter, really, just kids are getting attached, and the time, responsibility and our old lives, we're just not gonna really get them back until we do something about it. Did you talk to Dorothy? And? - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Well? Well, well. I don't know, I just feel weird about it. Yeah. I mean, you're right, it's the right thing to do, - and they're great people... - Wonderful people. The best. So, what do you think? What's not to like? - Would we still get to see them? - That's not a problem, - just needs to be convenient. - Right. So I will expedite the paperwork and Kaleb and Sung Lee can probably move in this weekend. - Excuse me? - Say that again. Oh, no, don't worry. I have a very good family willing to meet with Javier and Jordan. They're not right in town... Wait, wait a minute. You're going to split them up? I explained that it's difficult to find a family that's willing to take all four... Wait a second. This just can't happen. They need to go to the same... They need to go to the same family. Mrs. Danville, you were the one on the phone to me about the children becoming attached and how it was too painful - for you to deal with it... - Look, I need this to happen the right way, and I just don't have time for this, I just don't. - Sal. - No, look, Jason, I have an opportunity to go on tour. Do you know what that could mean? Why didn't you tell me? Cause everything is out of control. You know, our lives, I'd really like them back the way they used to be, you know? - Sally and I need to talk about this. - I can see that. - What is this about a tour? - Klay's got something lined up for me. Oh. - Don't act so excited for me. - It's not that. - It's... - What is it? It's just... I told you I met with General Lindford. Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I was a little out of it. He wants me to fly again. I thought you said you'd never fly again. I can't turn this one down, it's like a dream come true. Great. So what you're saying is that one of us needs to stay home - with these kids until... - I'm not saying that. I'm just trying to put everything on the table. Uh-huh, on the table, right. So both of us can see that your practical opportunity beats my artsy... Hey, come on, that's not what I'm saying. I mean... - What are you saying? - Well... Let's... What... In terms of dollars, that's true. It's true. What if there's a remote possibility that I can actually make it? Have you thought of that, maybe I can actually make it? - Let's not get crazy here. - For everything that I have done? No, I'm not getting crazy here. Listen, I'm just trying to figure out how I'm supposed to live with a husband that I love, this career that I have passion for and now these four kids that, quite frankly, I feel responsible for. I just... Look... - I love you. - I love you. - It's pronounced "Ugunda." - Oh, Ugunda. Good to know. I doubt I'll make it there anytime soon. You should try. It's the most beautiful country in Africa. - Sounds like you miss it, huh? - I miss my friends. You know what? I have good news for you. Wow, look at this place. Who drives these cars? Students? What kind of car is that? Pick it up, Jefferson. Coach Tamblyn! This is Javier Solarte. Ah! If it isn't the man with the golden boot. Javier, good to meet you, son. - I'm Tamblyn, I'm the football coach here. - I'm honored to meet you, sir. So, you played a bit of football, huh, someplace else? Yes, sir. I like football. Like it, don't like it, I don't really care, all I'm interested in is are you any good at it? Wychowski! Danny! Throw this man the ball. Let's see what he can do with it. He's a football player. Go for it. Kind of European, but we can work with it. He's got potential. Where are you from? What's he doing? Lighten up, son. - Kid's a loser, Coach. - Javier! Back to work! - You tricked me! - I was doing you a favor. That? That was no favor. That was to make me a fool! But you know what? I have been around! I have been on the street! I am no fool. I knew that ball was not a soccer ball. Javier, trust me, you showed them and they were impressed! They laughed! That's just guys, that's what they do. Hey, I'm sorry if you thought that I tricked you. Look at me. Hey, Javier, look at me. I would never do that. Never, okay? Okay? Come on, let's get out of here. Hey, Jordan! Hello. Hey, where's Javier? Gone out with some girl with blue hair, but said he'd be home for dinner. Oh, this is Noah. Noah Roorda. Hey, Mrs. Danville. How's it going? Pretty well, Noah. Nice to meet you. You, too. Hey, I checked out your music. It's pretty cool. I really like the acoustic stuff. - Thanks. - Keep up the good work. - Yeah, you too. - Bye. - Can we just go? - Okay. He promised me he'd be here. He never breaks a promise. - I'm going to kill him. - It's not good to kill. - Thank you, Kaleb, I'll remember that. - You'd better remember. All right. Hey, guys. Lighten up, take a breather. Bet you can't do this. Don't pretend like you're not impressed there. Watch this. Hello? Okay, Javier. All right, all right, just calm down. What... The police? Okay, tell them we're going to be right there, okay? All right. What's the situation? Not good. Jordan! Jordan! Jordan, wait. He's my brother, I should be the one that goes. Why you? Because I need you to stay here with Kaleb and Sung Lee. He's my family, not yours. Javier is our responsibility. You think you know my brother better than I do? Jordan, I didn't say that. What I am saying is that right now, you're in charge of this house and two young children. I need you to do this for us, please. We're going to get through this. It'll all turn out, you'll see. - Hold it. Hold it. - We're responsible for Javier Solarte. It's all right, he's free to go. We just got to finish a little paperwork, okay? Excuse me. Hey, I'm Christine. I was with Javier. All those guys say Javier started it, but he didn't. They teased him about playing football. They're just jealous 'cause he has way more talent than them, especially Danny. - Who's Danny? - Quarterback. He's totally insecure because the coach is so impressed with Javier. What, the football coach? Oh, yeah, he really wants Javier to play on the team. - I would never do that. - Hey, never say never. - Understand what I'm saying? - Yes, sir. I want you to get in the car. Thanks. What happened? Everything is okay, it's nothing serious. - Are you hurt? - It's not mine. Take it off. I'll wash it. - Jordan, you don't have to... - I want to! That okay with you? Hey, hey, look at this. Let me show you something. Look. Jordan Solarte, date of birth. Sixteen, sweet 16. This is a huge deal. I'm going to throw her a party and you know what? I'm going to win this girl's heart if I have to jump out of her cake to do it. So what I want to know is are you going to be there for it or are you going to be in the service again flying jets? Look, if I take this job, I'm not gonna be traveling all the time, and if I am, I'll be back on the weekends to make up for it. Weekends, nice. So, I'll just put my life on hold. Sal, it's going to work out. Dorothy is going to find a family for these kids and we're gonna get back on with our lives, okay? Look, you know, I don't know much about this parenting thing, but I know these kids, and kids need a male role model or a father figure. Especially those two boys, they... They need to see how to be a man, how to do man stuff. Like, right now. - Okay. Okay. - Okay what? Man stuff it is. - Hey, Babba. - Hey, city slicker. Jeff. Guys, this is Jeff Burton. - Here's some friends I want you to meet. - Hi. - How we doing? - All right, and you? - Good to see you. - You must be Jason Danville. - How are you? - Nice meeting you. Nice to meet you guys. Hey, guys, this guy's the real deal. He drives racecars. I'm a dad, too, so I'm pretty happy about that. He took first place 21 times. Hey, man, you know, I've been lucky, all right. - Thank you. - Hey, junior. Here are some hats. Here you go, fellows, hope you have a great time. - Thank you. - Nice meeting you. Have a good time. I'll see you. All right. Hello, I'm looking for a cake. Something like, you know, kind of a big, big rectangle, this tall. Something like that? Cool. Thank you. Attention shoppers, the store will be closing shortly. Please take your items to the cashier. Get some streamers, maybe some balloons. Hey, it's a zebra, huh? Zebra, zebra, please get better. Zebra, zebra, you're okay. When I was a little girl, I had to write a paper in school about an imaginary character named Roxy the Midnight Hairdresser. And in your sleep, she comes to visit you, and she lands on your head and she does a little dance. When you wake up, you have a fancy little hairdo. You like that? Okay, you ready to go to sleep? Okay. Zebra, too. No! Cheater. You don't play as well as you think. You're going to be sorry you even thought that. Offense, the essence of air power. A stupid cow leads her calf near the road. Peace through strength, victory through devastation. The frog never hops in daylight for nothing. What does that mean? No idea. All right. Okay, you maybe played once or twice. Every night with my dad. He was really good and way faster than me. What else did you do with him? You know, stuff. What kind of stuff? We used to hike a lot. He'd show me different plants and... He taught me about all kinds of things. For example? Like the right way to eat seasonal grasshoppers or how to ride a donkey backwards by pricking its tail with a thorn. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sounds like he was a wonderful man. He must have been a great father, I'm sure. He was. Good night. Good night, Jordan. Hi, come on in. Sorry to come so early. - Hello, Dorothy. - Hi. What I have to say can't wait. Where are the children? They're having breakfast. I'll be quick about this. - About what? - Family Services has stringent guidelines on guardianship and foster care. We take our responsibilities very seriously. Yeah, we know that. You said parenting wasn't in your playbook, and clearly you were right. I just finished reading a police report on Javier fighting. Another incident like that and the agency will remove the children from your custody. Sorry to come so early, but it had to be said. Don't listen to her. We're doing fine. Are we? - Coach. - Pleased to meet you. Welcome back. Danny, come on in here. Do a little peacemaking. Shake his hand. Tasey, get on in there. Javier, these are your colors. Wear them with pride. So, you're into music, eh, Kaleb? I like to play on the drum. My teacher told me the sound of the drum is like the beating heart. But for me, with this sound, I can forget all the bad things that happened in the past. Dude, that's my kind of music. I was thinking we'd start on the A to G. Think, you know, Stevie. Ready? Let's hit it. One, two, three! Whoo! Faster. That's my guy. No, thank you. - Look, see, that's from China. - Oh, it sure is. It's beautiful. Should we skip? Skip, skip, skip. Thanks, thank you. - Kids? You brought kids? - Yeah. This is Sung Lee and Kaleb... That's real nice. Now listen, sweetie, you can't bring kids in here. Relax, Klay, it's just a sound check. - Anyway, the joint's closed. - It's all good, man. - Exactly. - No, it's not good, it's not all good. Guess who's here. Izzy Popyk, that's right. Cover of Billboard, managed Fillmore West before he... - Klay, Klay, I know. - Izzy Popyk's one big dude. Hello. Listen, just take the kids up to the band room. - They won't make a sound, right? Right? - Mmm-hmm. All right, that was sweet. Let's go. - All right, all right, you guys, let's do this. - Let's do it. Here you go. Now, you all heard what Sally said. What Sally says is law, right? So I want you both to sit your butt... Sit down here on this fine comfortable couch, don't move, don't make a sound or nothing, right? Nod your heads so I know you understand, then. All right, brilliant. - Look at this. - Nice. Yo! You, effects kid. Kill the smoke. It's a sound check! That's him, that's lzzy. Check. Testing, check, testing, check 1, 2... You're actually going to do this? Or you're going to do this. We've got about 15 minutes, right just test this... - See if you're going to get this movement. - Check, check... Okay let's do a sound check. Can we do a sound check anyone? Sung Lee. Sung Lee. - We're up next. - All right. Okay. Yeah, I'm ready. Listen, just give lzzy a little taste, all right? Just a wee bit. So this is an audition? No, no, no, you got the gig, it's just he's a promoter with a ton of clout so, you know. - And who's this? - This is Noah. Noah Roorda. It's nice meeting you, Mr. Danville. - So you're Noah, huh? - Yup. Javier, get your distance. Three back and one. Danny? Let's see if you got it. Watch me. Hut! He did it! He did it! That's my brother. He's the best. Nice job, man. Where is Sally? Where is Sally? Everyone, hold on. Hold on there. Those belong to you? Uh... Yeah. Yeah, they do. I don't ever allow kids in any venue on tour, including this one. Excuse me, is this place even open right now? Oh, that's not the point. My tour, my rules. So get them out of here right now or you don't go on that stage. You know what, Sally? Why don't I just take them out for an ice cream? You know, chocolate, vanilla... Klay, just leave it. Yeah, you know what? I've got this other gig. It's actually a much bigger deal at the moment, so... What are you talking about? Hey, kids. Let's go. We've put so much hard work into this... If you go now, it's done! Why are you doing this? Change of plans, I'm outta here. Perfect. Hey, you two, how's that going over there? We got it. Auntie Sally, you want to see what my sister and me learned at school? Yeah. Wow, that's awesome. How about... My turn. Okay. Guys, guys, they're here. Hurry up, hide! I don't know, something. What's with the cloth? Surprise! Surprise! Happy birthday! What's wrong? Nothing. This is... This is great. You just shouldn't have gone to all this trouble. It wasn't trouble, it was fun. Wow. I mean, look at all of this. I'm just going to go put my bag away. Excuse me. - Hey. - I don't want to talk about it. Can I come in? Jordan... What's wrong? Why did you have a party? You turned 16. It's a big deal. You know, I thought it was a special occasion. - It's not anymore. - Jordan, I'm sorry if I upset you. I don't understand, though. - It doesn't matter. - Yeah, it matters. It matters to me. - Is it about your parents? - Yeah. You can tell me. Can I? Can I really? You can. My mom and I, we had this plan. You know, we were together a lot because we all helped them out in the villages and we delivered food and medicine and Mom and I never had any time together. So, that's what we planned. I told her what I really wanted when I turned 16, what I wanted more than anything was just one day, just one day just the two of us. No party, just... ...time together, but... No wonder you didn't want a party. I didn't even want a birthday. I want my mom and dad back. Thanks for trusting me. Thank you for being here for us. What? You should have seen Javier kick that football today. - Kid is incredible. - Yeah. I mean, you know, he's really incredible. Oh. Jordan can ride a donkey backwards. There's a skill set, huh? I'm not surprised. Jason. Hmm? I've been thinking. Yeah, me too. I don't know, there's just something about all this that I honestly didn't expect, but these kids... Mmm. You know what I mean? Oh. I... I... - I know. It's not... - It's not what we planned. No, not in our planning, not at all, - not a little bit. - Not a little bit, but... - Even so... - Even so... I know that it's going to take a lot of... - Sacrifice. - Sacrifice. - Yeah, for both of us. - I know. But I think it's worth it. I mean, do you think... - Yes. - Yeah? You think we can do this? I'll call Dorothy. Welcome to parenthood. - The final frontier. - Hmm. - What are we thinking? - I don't know. Hmm. Klay. Hey, hi. - Hey. - How are you doing, Sal? - Can I talk to you about something? - Sure. I've got some great new material. Oh, that's great, so glad to hear that. No, no, no, I need a big stage. You know, bigger than anything that I've done. - Good luck with that. - Listen, Klay. - What do you want from me? - I'm sorry. - You messed up. - I let you down, okay? I'm sorry. - Please, Klay. - What is it? You're the only one that can make this happen for me. Please? Hello. You have one new message. Mr. And Mrs. Danville, good news. We've found the perfect family that will take all four children. Transition is set for this weekend. I need to come over now, Christine. I gotta talk to you. Gotta go. You have no new messages. You know, in Dayton, Ohio, two amazing facts, the Wright brothers invented the very first successful engine-powered aircraft, and the first recording of Hang on Sloopy, which became the first official rock song of the State of Ohio. - Do I appear nervous to you? - No. - Not at all. - No? Oh. There's your... Everybody. - Kaleb. - Hello, Noah. Hey, Mrs. Danville. Hey, Noah. It's getting a little late, don't you think? Yeah, I'm just on my way home. Are you going to kiss my sister? I'm not sure about that. - Are you scared? - Pretty much, yeah. Good night. Good night. Oh. Wow, what a day. Did you talk to Dorothy? I left a message at the office and they said that she'd call back. You still okay with what we're doing? Absolutely. What about you? You okay with compromising your dream come true? Well, you know, I was thinking, after Buster crashed, I had to go out there and make a living for us. That's still what I want to do. It's just a bigger us, better dream. Auntie Sally, Major Jason. Javier is not in the house. I looked everywhere. - Anything? - No, nothing. - I'll go check out back. - Hold on. We've put out an APB. It's just a matter of time. Good, thank you. You did the right thing coming in here. I wish most parents had your common sense. Thanks. Yeah, he's at the Wells. They found him. They found him at the Malcolm Wells Hospital, Emergency. We're here to see Javier Solarte. Are you family? Yeah, we are. In a matter of speaking... We're responsible. Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second? - How's he doing? What's going on? - No, no, he's okay. - A few cuts, nothing broken. But... - Good. Your car is kind of mangled. It ended up on the front lawn. We don't care about that, but why... Why did he do it? Can the children go see their brother Javier Solarte? Sure, just for a few minutes. He's right here. Go ahead, kids. So, Christine... Are you okay? Are you okay? What happened? There was a message on your phone. He found out you're going to send them all away to another family. And... Well... - Come on, it's okay. - Just tell us, it's all right. He... He thought you cared more about him than that. Mr. And Mrs. Danville. - Hi. - Is Javier all right? - Yeah, he's going to be fine. - He's going to be okay. - Oh. Thank goodness. - Did you leave us a message? Yeah, you didn't get it? We found the perfect family. They'll take all four. Transition is set for this weekend. No, we didn't get it, but Javier did. Oh, I see. Dorothy, we are happy to tell you we don't need a transition. We want to adopt the kids and make it official. Oh, that's impossible now. Why is that impossible? Yeah, I mean, you begged us to take these kids and now we want to. - We're ready. - That was before. Before what? I explained all of this to you after the first incident. I warned you. I was serious, I meant it. Look, Javier, he was just upset and he didn't know... Mrs. Danville, we cannot allow it. - Allow what? - Yeah, I mean... We've become a family now. We love these children. We want to make it official. That is not the issue. Family Services cannot take a risk, and you two are a risk. No, we're not. Oh, come on, nobody starts out being a perfect parent. You need practice, you make mistakes, and then, you know, sometimes you blow it... Yes, and both of you have done all of that. Now, I can't agree with your proposal, and if you attempt it, I'll have to fight you in a court of law. Look, Dorothy, listen. You know, when we all started with this, we were just concerned about the inconvenience in our lives, about our careers and our relationship, but these kids, they changed everything and just set us on a completely different path. Better path, you know, beyond our narrow vision. Yeah, we're ready just to give it all away instead of taking it for ourselves, and we mean that. All good feelings aside, there's no evidence that you two can deal with this enormous responsibility. We can. Now all four children are to be remanded into Family Services protective custody - pending placement. - You can't do this. Excuse me. Hello, Jordan. My mother and father taught me to speak my mind. Yes, that's a good thing. You think you know the right thing to do, but you don't. You have no idea how hard Sally and Jason have tried to be good parents. It was an obligation at first, we could tell that. But it's different now. Javier didn't do what he did because they were bad parents, he did it because he was... He loved them. And he was upset because he thought that they didn't love him. But we all know that's not true. And we all love them. And we won't live with anyone else no matter what you intend to do in court. - I appreciate your feelings, honey, but... - Wait, wait, wait. There's a reason Sally was on that list. My mother believed in her, trusted her with her most sacred possessions. Out of respect for that, for my mother and father, will you please reconsider and not fight against it? Can you appreciate how sincerely our department considers the welfare of children, because nothing else really matters, you know. - Look, Dorothy, I... - I listened to Jordan. I feel the looks on these faces, and there's no question. The welfare of these children could never be placed in more capable or loving hands. Your case is closed. - Really? - Oh. Thank you, thank you! Oh, yay! - Come here. - Oh, my God. I'm sorry about the car, man. Don't worry about the car, pal. You okay? I'm telling you what, these dancers from China were awesome. All right, so listen. I'm seeing a lot of familiar faces. You're here every year, I'm here every year, we all come for the same reason, to celebrate the family of man, right? This festival is definitely near and dear to my heart, and I tell you what, we have a girl that is a late entry, but she is definitely someone I'm sure you're gonna love. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Sally Danville and Plane Truth. Thank you so much, it's so great to be here. I just want to thank Randy Jackson, I want to thank my manager Klay, but I really just want to thank my husband Jason. And this next song, it's brand new and I wrote it for my family. Wow, my family, so... Here we go, I hope you like it.
