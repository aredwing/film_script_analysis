Things that are a part of us, before we've even left the womb. Philip! Philip! Don't worry, Cathy. Everything's going to be all right.! I suppose every family has its own share of quirks. But the Furlongs were always a little more peculiar than most. Just like Philip's father, Charlie Furlong. One day, Charlie saw something he never wanted to see. Something that had a profound effect on him. Ever since then, whenever he thought about sex Charlie Furlong went blind for 37 minutes. Mr. Charlie Furlong? Yes, Mrs. Charlotte Furlong? I'm ready for you. It caused him a lifetime of problems, not least on his wedding night. Their son, Philip, also had an ability. Like Charlie... Open your mouth. and all the Furlong men before him... he, too, had a strange gift. Whenever he got frightened it knocks out everything electrical around him. This should not have been a problem for him. Except... Cathy, you still with me, Love? Oh my God! Help me, Philip. Cathy Furlong passed away before she even saw her baby. But she had already chosen a name: Marianne, if it was a girl. And if it was a boy... James Furlong. By the time he was ten years old, James Furlong had lost his grandfather, too. Charlie Furlong died in a car accident. He passed an advertisement for a Wonderbra... then crashed straight into a tree. Look, but don't touch, you'll ruin his makeup. Look, here is the first time I saw you in a photograph. Having lost her husband and daughter-in-law, James' grandmother regarded the Furlong Condition as nothing short of a curse. And she was worried about its potential for James. It was she who tried to warn him about his family history. She moved in and home schooled James, keeping a close eye on him. Come on, James, it's easy! But instead of listening to her, James secretly wished that he, too, had an ability. Like walking through walls, or bionic strength, or, the ability to fly. Where the hell have you been? James. I got kicked. Kicked? But who? There's something wrong with the cow. James, what happened? What did you do, poison 'em? Calm down, Philip. Don't tell me to calm down! Half the herd is lyin' dead out there. Even the fuckin' grass is dead! What are you talking about? I knew there was something wrong with you from the day you were born! - Come back here! - Oh, Philip, Philip. Get out of the car! How dare you even set foot in there! You ruined everything! What did you do? Oh, don't worry, James, it's only temporary, until we find a nice family for you. C'mon, kids. Keep it going! Keep it going! Ah, don't be scared, that's just Tinker, He's a sweetie. He'll be fine once he get to know you. This is the dormitory and that is going to be your bed, where I'm sure you'll be very comfortable. And why aren't you boys at hurling practice, huh? Liam! This is James. and I want you to make him feel very welcome here. Okay? Yes, Mrs. Moore. Good! Liam! Could you please take our new friend down to the laundry room and make sure he's given something good and warm to wear. Yes, Mrs. Moore. Now, run along! Here, you can wear this. It looks good. Where's your clothes go? Hey, gorgeous, where you hidden your cunny? Come on, let's go. Come on, Liam, then. They're so stupid! They always hide them in the same place. Thank you. Look who's robbing the kitchen again? You want some jelly? Go get them, fagot! Hurry up, Furlong! Move your ass! - Liam! Run! - Shut your fucking mouth. Last night an incident took place. A very serious incident, that involved the death of one of our family here at St. Jude's. Coach Hanley's beloved dog Tinker. Quiet, Boys! This is no laughing matter, believe you me! I wish to speak to each and every single one of you individually today to find out exactly what happened. And Kevin, you can take that smirk off you face and come with me. I think I'll start with you. You little fucker. I should have squealed on you. Why did you let him go? Fuck! - Kill him! - You killed that dog for me. You're gonna pay for it! Stay out of it! Kick the life out of him, Kevin! Yeah! Kevin? James... Okay, now, we're just gonna take a look at these stitches. So if you want to, just hold this back for me there. Okay. It's all right, Baby, it's the last one. Stitches look good! Gorgeous, aren't they? Mountain people think I had a cesarean section. What do you think? I'm afraid the incision's rather bigger than we normally do for a cesarean. Well, I'll just say I had a giant baby, then! Be serious for a second, will you! What the verdict, Doctor? Are we out of the woods yet? Would you excuse us for a moment, Mae? I don't think she's going to recover. How long, Doctor? Well, it's really anybody's guess. Could be 3 weeks, could be 3 months. The most important thing we can do is make her feel as comfortable as possible. Oh, my God! - Hi, Liam. - Oh, hi. You're looking better today. The wonders of makeup! So, um... What did the doctor say? They gonna operate again. No, he says I've made a miraculous recovery, and I can go home whenever I want. Then what are you still doing here, then? Good question, Liam. Are... are you going for a walk? Hey, Mae, you know youre not supposed to leave the grounds! What are you gonna do, tell on me? Hey, Mae, where are you going? Every family has its own legacy. Good or bad, we inherit it all. From allergies, to bad eyesight, big noses, to cancer, which is what I got. Not the big nose, but the cancer. I would have preferred a big nose, or a weak heart, or a humped back. But my father didn't have any of those, either. In each generation, going right back, from prostate to bowel, throat to brain tumor, we've had every flavor of cancer there is. Mine was in my intestines. So I decided it was okay to keep smoking. Shit! Hello! Is someone there? Thanks. I'm not contagious, you know. Don't let the clothes fool you. I'll go as soon as the rain stops. You'll never even know I was here. Can you pass my bra? These are by P which is Greek to me. I'm Mae, by the way. West. Mae... Mae West? O'Mara. My mother named me after the film star. What's your name? James. Just James? Did you make these, James? You're a real chatterbox, you know that? It's my music. You want to listen? I'll trade you. This is spectacular. Is it duck? Is it duck? It's... pheasant. And squirrel. Did you like it? Of course you did, it's Motown. Of course... Motown. I don't think it's a place. It's a record label, from the '60s. Diana Ross and the Supremes... Motown! My dad used to play it. So, what happened out here? It looks like a nuclear bomb went off. It's been like that for a while. Must be something wrong with the soil. So, what's the story with you, James? Are you some kind of woodsman or something? How long have you lived here? A few years. And you like it? I've never eaten an owl before. There's owl in this, too. How many other, cute, little animals am I eating here? Well... Thanks for breakfast. Is there anywhere I can wash? You head that way, until you reach the stream, and then you follow it to the river. Well... Goodbye, then. Thank you for the food... and everything. You're welcome. Thought you might need that for the swim. Thanks. It's beautiful. I haven't been swimming in ages. - You probably go all the time. - No. Why not? I never learned how. You can't swim? Well, it's easy. I could teach you! You shouldn't stare. I had a cesarean section. What's that? It's when you have a baby. You had a baby? You're very gullible, James! I have a tumor in there. Is it bad? If you like being alive... yes... bad. They cut me open a couple of times to dig it out. So it's gone. They got some of it... but it's spread further now. So they can't operate anymore. So that's one good thing at least. So, what happens now? Good question. Did you run away? You make it sound so dramatic. You've no family? Just me and my Mum. My Dad died a few years ago. That's where I got it from, his side of the family. But I got his smile, too. So, it all balances out. Right? Will she come here looking for you? Maybe. You can sit beside me if you want. That's great! How did you do it? - Where? Here? - Blow hard! - You're eating it. - It's wild garlic. I think I could find my way back from here. Thank you, James. I had a really nice time. I would hope. Well, I'll see you around. Mae West O'Mara! Mae! We've checked every inch of the building and grounds. So, I think it's time we widened the search. These are by P which is Greek to me. Think we should dredge the river? No, she didn't kill herself. Mae is not the kind of angsty teenager who's going to do herself in. She loves life! And that's the problem; that's why she left. Maybe you should go home, get some rest. I'm not going anywhere until you find my daughter and bring her back safe. Liam? What are you doing here? I'm sorry I didn't say anything before, it's that... I didn't want to get Mae into trouble. What are you talking about, Liam? I know which way she went. James? Are you okay? What happened here? You're bleeding. I'm sorry. What? Are you okay? We've got a lot of ground to cover before dark. Mae! Mae! That's enough for tonight. We'll start back here in the morning. Sergeant! Can't we just... just another hour? Is that your mother? Why didn't you go out to her? And just leave you here? You should have. It's okay. You shouldn't be here. You should have gone long ago. You said you'd... go as you said. I'd never even know you were here. You're the one who came after me. I can't have people coming here. You need to go back. They're not going to hurt you, James. What are you afraid of? You're not safe here. You think I'm in danger? Why? Why do you want me to go? 'Cause... no one can be around me. Because I can't stop it. I can never stop it... not here... not at the farm... not at the Reformatory. People have been dying around me all my life. No one knew what had happened. But it happened again at the Reformatory. And.. I could... I could feel it welling up in me... I could hardly breathe. I tried to fight it back, but... it was too late. The lads... closest to me were already... Couldn't hide from it anymore. It was my fault. All I could think of was to run. At the far end of the grounds, I saw Liam. And he was slumped on the ground, right on the edge of the yellow grass. He called me. But I knew I couldn't be around anyone anymore. I ran into the woods as fast as I could. I ran for hours. Got lost. I was so scared. I was only small. I was tiny, really. I found some berries. And I finally ate something. It made me so sick. I must have... I passed out sore. I was sure I was going to die there in the woods. Alone. And then this man... came out of nowhere. And he... picked me up and carried me out. When I opened my eyes... I was here. This is his home. I didn't know what was happening. And, in the night... the pain had got worse. And I begged him to go... I begged him to go, to leave me, because I knew what would happen. But he stayed. A few hours later... I woke up and... I tried to leave. I walked out the door, and there he was, half buried in yellow leaves. Mister! Mister! Please, get up! It was over. He'd taken me into his home. He'd saved me. But now he was dead, just like all the others. Then what? You killed them all? Is that what you want me to believe? I know it's going to kill me, James. It's not you. I'm not afraid of you. Are you going to pass this thing down to all your sons and daughters, too? The girls won't get it. I don't know why. It just goes from son to son. Furlong to Furlong. Are you okay? Can't they do anything to make you better? Anything they can do, they've already done. And you're a palm ready now? It says you're going to live a long and healthy life. And have lots of babies. And give them all weird names. - You're cold. - A little. I have to go back soon. Stay. Stay a little while longer. Mae? Can we leave the interrogation there, Sergeant? She needs her rest. Just one more question, please. A couple of my men ran into a young man in the woods. About 18. Looks like he might be living there. Did you come across him? Are you sure? Look! I already old you everything. I ran away and got lost. It was a stupid thing to do, and I'm sorry I caused so much trouble, but... I'm here now. All right. Of course. Well. The important thing is that you're safe. I hope you feel better soon, Mae! She never even met the guy. Call the lads back, we're done here. Thank you for not being angry with me. What makes you think I'm not angry? I'm fucking furious! Do not ever do that to me again, Babe. My God, I love you. I do, too. Well, you must be hungry. Well, I'll bring you some food. Thanks. That was fast. Hi, Liam. Hi! You've found, didn't you? I thought he was dead, but you found that fucking murderer, didn't you? You know who he is? Do you know what he did? James didn't mean to hurt anyone. He didn't mean to hurt anyone? What are you saying? He didn't mean to fuck up my life? He didn't mean to ruin my lungs, and turn me into a freak? He ruined everything! It wasn't his fault. Well, then who's fault was it, huh?! Get off! Why are you acting like he's some kind of a friend? Why are you defending him? I'm your friend. I'm the one who wants to protect you, I... I love you. Get off! Liam. Are you okay? You're leaving? Haven't you heard? Your girlfriend is no longer missing. She's not my girlfriend. Maybe you should ask her out. She's lying! She met someone out there. You have to go after him. This was a missing person case, Liam, and as I just told you, she is no longer missing. But, you don't understand, that guy in the woods, he was in the Reformatory. - He was here, he killed everyone. - Liam, we've been through this before. - Well, you can't just do nothing! - Liam! I saw him! He killed the dog. He made the grass burn. He's like the Devil. He killed them, he killed everyone! Let go! Let go! Don't touch me! Come on! Come on! It's all right, it's all right! Good night, Sweetheart. Mrs. O'Mara? I don't want to get your hopes up, but there's definitely been an improvement in the last couple of days, and to be honest, this is very unexpected... it's quite a turnaround really. But she seems to be showing early signs of remission despite her little excursion. That's great news, Doctor! We're going to run some more tests in the morning. Why it... Thank you, Doctor. James. I... I'm... I'm looking for someone. Mae West O'Mara. Can you help me? She's not on this floor. Two floors up. Thank you. Mae. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. You're soaking wet. It's raining. I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye. It's the only way I could do it. I didn't you to see me die. I've got something for you. You made them better. There were buds on every branch... and birds everywhere. I don't think I can take credit for that. It was a late Spring. But at least it will be prettier there now. Just when there's no one to see it? You're not going back? I don't know. You don't belong out there, James. I don't know where I belong, Mae. I wanted to see you. I can't stay here. You're not going to hurt anyone. Not while you're with me. I won't let you. Stay with me. Everyone! Make your way to the main stairwell! No running, please! Nurse! Nurse! I can't walk! It's pretty chilly outside, Michael. So you're going to need a good, warm coat. Michael! Michael! Michael! Come on, let's go! It's okay. I promise, No one's going to hurt you, James. I know what you've done, and you're going to have to pay for it. You were my friend. Liam, no! Get off me! Stop! Stay away from him! You don't know what you're doing. You should have never come back here! I won't let you do it again! You're not going to hurt anyone! I'm not hurting you. I'm not here to hurt anyone! You were my friend, I helped you. I stopped Kevin, he was going to kill you. - Me and Mae... - You're a liar! You're never going to see her again. She doesn't know who you are, but I do. James! James! Are you hurt? Stay back, Mae! Don't come any closer! James! Wait! Then a few months later, I saw his eyes again. And his smile. What about the leaves? I don't make them die, do I? You only inherited the good stuff... the best of them. The leaves die because it's part of life. To make room for new leaves. Which is what you are. A whole new branch of the family. A Furlong-O'Mara. Diana Ross Furlong O'Mara. The long line of Furlongs had come to an end. Their strange gifts died out with James. But I don't know if he ever really understood what was inside him. He thought it was just a curse. But love brought out something else. And he gave me a future again..
