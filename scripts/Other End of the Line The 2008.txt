Vikram's family does not know anything. therwise. You know what could have happened. Credit card company? Yes.

It's just terrific. I'm sure your fiance must enjoy it. You're engaged? h. No. No. No. No. He's not asking as a jealous boyfriend. He's asking merely as a polite conversation starter. Priya! Priya! Where are you going? Look. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell is going on. Granger. Not here. Please. Come. You wanna tell me who you really are? I'm Priya Sethi. I live in Mumbai. Just like I told you. nd who else are you? I'm Jennifer David from CIYone Bank Business Processes. Say something else. Say something else.

But the truth is everything else I've told you. I don't know what to believe. You know what? Forget it. Yeah. I've known you for. What. A few days? Let's not blow this thing out of proportion. It was fun. Let's just leave it at that. Granger. Please... Damn it! Stay away from my daughter. Okay? Who is that guy? h. My God. I always imagined Indian parties to be peaceful affairs. You know. Gandhi-esque. Incense and Kama Sutra. Never have expectations. - You know what your deal is? - No. What's my deal? You never totally put yourself out there. You round the corners and you play it safe. You never let people see who you really are. But you're selling yourself short. Man. ired of watching you do that. If you want big rewards. You have to take the big risks. But you're afraid. So you wind up with nothing. Wow! his girl really took you out. So what? I'm just supposed to tell her to leave her fiance and move to merica to be with me? I don't even know if I'm gonna have a job next week. She pretended to be someone she wasn't. Maybe that's who she needed to be to have her big adventure. Haven't you ever pretended to be someone you're not. Granger? For the last 37 years at Hawksin Hotels. It's been our passion... - Happy birthday. - Emory? What are you doing here? Well. I came to wish you a happy birthday. Well. It's not my birthday. And I thought we broke up. I forgive you. - Good luck. Priya. - hank you. Emory. I... Em... Em. Em. I can't do this. Okay? I'm here for work. I don't have time for this. kay. Whatever. You know. It's actually probably for the best. Since I wouldn't want to remember us both naked when I do it. - Do what? - Propose. You jerk. What? - You're joking. Right? - No. And that better not be your answer. I just thought. You know. We were seeing other people. - You know. Mark Bailey. Private jets. - Let's review. Sweetie. Okay? We are both good-looking. We both went to Ivy League schools. he sex is amazing. You make it sound like a merger. You're never going to find anyone better than me. And you know it. Em. Em... Priya. Before you close your door. Please... I know I should have had told you I was engaged. I'm sorry. But the truth is. Maybe I did come all the way wanting a romantic moment with someone I've never met because maybe I was running away from my life. nd then I met you. My feet stayed still. Maybe they floated a little. I couldn't leave tomorrow without you knowing how I feel. - nd I hope that maybe you've... - Grange? Is my fiance bugging you for towels again? - It's not... - Necessary. h. And we're not going to need turndown service later because. Well. We're just going to mess it up. Just give me a minute. Em. Hey! You don't need to explain it to the maid. It's a hotel. For gosh sake! - Look. I'm... - hat's right. I should have looked. Then I'd have seen what a hypocrite... hat's the English word. Right? Someone like you. You're going back to India to your fiance. What do you want me to do? You'll like this one. So these two lawyers go to heaven. And they meet Saint Peter... You guys heard of Saint Peter? Let's just walk around the man in the towel. Which reminds me. Those are the 300 count cotton towels. Egyptian cotton. Too. I think it's the best. At Hawksin Hotels we help you to be who you need to be, so you can be who you really want to be.

You'll find someone who'll make you happy. But I don't believe it's me. I know I'm disappointing you. It's just. Something happened when I was gone. I jumped in the ocean.

I've recently taken over from Miss Prasad who was promoted to Regional Manager. So, I welcome you all to CITYone Business Processes. As you all know, you'll be spending as an merican. You'll have an American name, an American city of residence, but it's very important to remember that you're not an American. You're an Indian and your merican identity is simply there to make it easier for you to communicate with the person at the other end of the line. But you must leave it at your desk the moment you take off the headset. I'm desperate for you Excuse me. Everybody. It's time for the customary best man speech. When Charlie and I were 14. We went to Camp Whichiwawa And being the mischievous little fellows that we were. One night we decided to sneak across to the girls' cabins. Now. The only way to get over to Camp Whichiwuwu was over this little river. Now. To the 14-year-old me. In the middle of the night. It looked like the Mississippi. You know. So I say to Charlie. I say. "Dude. I'm not going in there. "It's probably full of snakes and eels and crocodiles. " And by the time I'd finished listing all my reasons. Chucky boy here was already on the other side. I chickened out and went back to the cabins. But Charlie here. He forged ahead to the girls' cabins and he met a young lady that night. Believe it or not. young lady named Karen Miller. Now. When Charlie got back to the bunks. He says to me. He says. "Dude. Dude. I just met the girl I'm gonna marry. " Flash forward 10 years later. Charlie and I are at a barbeque at Massapequa or Quitipeak or Quahog or somewhere. Then he sees her across the room. Now. Charlie was on a date that night. But he left her just like he left me on the other side of that river nd me being the voice of reason. I say to Charlie. I say. "You can't leave. " And he turns to me and he says something I'll never forget. He says. "Nothing should ever hold a man back from his future. " Nothing should ever hold a man back from his future. So. To my best friend. Charlie. Who wasn't afraid to cross the river. And to Karen. Who was waiting for him on the other... I gotta go. axi! Hey! How're you doing? irport. s fast as you can. Hear me out, don't tear away 'Cause this is what I'm trying to say Hey. Hey. Would you mind stepping on it? I got to get to the airport in 40 minutes. Hey. Dude.
