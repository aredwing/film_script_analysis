And where do they go? - Where is it? - There. - The Pantheon? - Montparnasse Tower? - The Pantheon? - No, Montparnasse. There. - The Pantheon? - The universe! And the muniverse? The muniverse? The muniverse is tired. Where is the universe? - Mom! - Where is it? Everywhere. The universe is everywhere. Hello. Lift your head. Don't forget your feet. Your head, sweetie. At the same time. There you go! That's it. That's the center of the heart. The heart's heart, if you like. If I zoom in too close, we can't see much. Your heartbeat's regular. The treatment seems to be helping. But... But? But what? I don't want to see the foliage. Hide the foliage. Hello! There! Now the mushrooms. That's what makes it look like autumn. I don't want to see... What a ninny! Unbelievable! There! Now fan out the bouquet a little. - Hello! Feeling better? - Yes, thank you. Solne, you had a customer! Passionate Paris. Party Paris. Singing Paris. Heartfelt Paris. But also working Paris. Commuting Paris. Ritzy, shabby, trashy Paris. Paris, you have a thousand faces. Paris, who are you? The capitail abounds in... Shit! - Ca-pi-tal! - Cut! Give it a rest, Lorenzo. This is Roland Verneuil. I can't make it. I'm sorry this is so last minute but I'm kind of tied up. Nothing serious, I hope. Well, sort of. I have a burial to go to. Oh, I see. I hope it isn't anyone too close. Well, yes. In fact... it's my father. What can I say? Nothing. He's dead, that's it. I'm just sorry to cancel our meeting, yet again. You're like some old geezer! Get some exercise! Can't those jerks fix the elevator! I swear! They just put in a new one... When was it? Two years ago? - Two years. - This younger generation! In shambles before their time. Dad! Come on. Pull yourself together. Shit! He was 95 years old. That's some score! He died peacefully. It's not as though... Come on! It's hard to leave him. Come on... A nice bowl of soup, a little blow job from Mlanie... You'll see. You're dumb! What's your name, girly? Let me go! What did you do? - Did you whistle at me? - No, I... Like I'm some mutt? No, sorry, ma'am. Fuck! Beat it, asshole! So? - What is it? - Come in. You sounded weird on the phone. Well, I... I'm sick. It's a heart thing. My days may be numbered. They're not too optimistic. I may need a heart transplant. Even then I may not pull through. They say 50% but... I guess that means a 40% success rate. What does that mean, a 40% success rate? Well, 40% means a 60% chance it won't work, that it'll be useless. You know, I feel like it's barely started and now... How long have you known? It started 3 months ago. It took me a month to go to a doctor. Then all the tests and everything... I've known for a month. Why didn't you say anything? Because... I don't know. We haven't seen each other in a long time. And... - I don't wanna tell everyone. - I'm not everyone. Right! Your sister, your family... you don't give a shit! - Fuck! - There! That's it! What, "That's it?" That's what? I may die, I tell you... and you fucking yell at me. I'm sorry. Shit! And Mom and Dad? Have you told them? No. I can't tell Mom and Dad. Can you imagine? Okay, so how do you... live? Moneywise? I live on the little money I have left but... - That's running out. - I'll take care of that. You're all alone here? How do you spend your days? I watch a little TV but that's pretty boring. I've started gardening. I plant stuff. What blows my mind most is looking out the window. - Meaning? - I watch other people live. I wonder who they are, where they go? They become the heroes of my little stories. I like that. It's not much, but... frankly, it keeps me going. Here's your change, sir. Thank you. Have a nice day. - Hi. - Hi, Lauryn. How are you? Oh, you're Lauryn's mom? I'm Simone's mom. I saw you at school. Oh, yeah! Right, Simone. Lauryn's always talking about her. Simone's the one who doesn't know her father. Yes. You told me that. So, I'll take a kilo of apples. Okay, a kilo of apples! This one's a real beauty, isn't it? Yes, fine. I'll even cut you a deal. - What? - A special deal - 'cause you're so pretty. - That's nice. Careful, he's a Don Juan! But he hates caviar. Peddle your bananas and leave me alone. I do what I want. I'm warning the lady. Cut it out with Franky. Wanna go for a drink? Me? I guess not! You're not into that? Happy? I do what I want, too. Anything else? Pull it with your left hand then a quarter turn. Didn't you make knots in school? This is really incredible! Hello! I can't keep you on, if this keeps up. - Madam. - A baguette, please. - A "tradition"? - No, a normal one. They say to hire young people but kids don't want to work these days. - It's only my second day. - Right! It wasn't like that in my day! - Thank you. - Thank you so, so much. Oh, I forgot to tell you... Simone's best friend's mother works at the market. Oh? Crazy, huh! This place is a mess! Why do guys live in such pigsties? Are you forced to leave these disgusting... I don't get it! Shit, don't dump all your guy problems on me! If you don't feel like doing that stuff, don't feel obligated. I don't feel obligated but I feel obligated to clean. It stinks. Really! Mam? Beno?t! Miss! Miss! Do you like flowers? Fuck off! Bernard, she's for you! She's your "style!" - No way. - Leave the girls alone! Nothing better to do? You jealous or what? Of who? Her? Jealous of her? No! Sometimes I'm jealous of me. Know what I mean? I think, "Boy, am I lucky to be me." I see myself and think, "What a fuckin' babe!" Then I realize... "Hey! That babe is me!" I don't have to be jealous. If you get my drift. I get it. What a saleswoman! You can sell anybody anything! You want me to sell you something? Okay, Caroline, do you mind if we go to work? See ya. Caroline, this is your last week with us. - Jealous? - No. We separated a year ago. Flirt if you like. But I don't have to watch that shit. Chill out. I'll be outta here soon. Hello. Did you do your hair with dynamite? - A head of lettuce. - The lettuce... Like you, they're not too pretty today. Thanks. Take some avocados. From Cameroon - beautiful, round. They'll put color in your cheeks! - How much? - 7,000. - Too much. - That's the best price. - I'll give you 5,000. - 6,000. - Five. - Six. I came to say goodbye. I'm not working here anymore. - You lost your job? - Yes. That happens here. We'll miss you. Me, too. If you still plan to come to France... - I'll leave my number. - That's nice. Thanks. - Call me, if you come! - I will. If I come, that is. Bye. So you're... How many are you? Two adults and four children. My brother's coming from Cameroon soon. Then there'll be three adults in the house. You absolutely must find those pay slips... Excuse me, if you want my help... Without those pay slips, you can't get any subsidies. What month was that for? You're only missing two! I'm missing two pay slips. Have you looked everywhere? All the documents are there. Yes, but you're missing some. - What's the problem? - It's my brother. He was supposed to arrive a while ago. She's getting impatient. Try to be on time for these meetings! Sorry. Before we move on to general business, Elise has a personal announcement. Over the next few months, I need some time for myself. So if I could go on half-time or even 4/5-time, that would help me out. Have you spoken to Diedrich? - Not yet. - He'll never agree. - Not now! - You say time "for you." What does that mean? Well, it means... "for me." I need to spend time at home. You okay, there, "Marie-Antoinette"? Just great! I'm buying tons of evening gowns to waltz around the Hall of Mirrors. Take it easy! Hearing you say "time for myself..." I need time for myself, too. We all do. - Look at Suzini! - What, Suzini? You need time for yourself, too! - I don't give a damn about myself. - That's what I meant. I need some time for myself! I think I do enough for everyone else here. I'm not gonna tell my life story. I mean, I'm just asking for a little solidarity for a short time. Your life is your life. Your problems don't interest me. But I remind you, you're an elected representative. Yeah, that I know. And you wanna leave now, during negotiations. I know. It's a drag but... I can't carry out those responsibilities during this period. You just think of yourself! - I'd love that. - Thanks. It's always been like that in Paris. The common opinion that there's an old Paris and a modernity that's brutally struggling to destroy and deface it is completely false. An ancient city continually recreates its modernity out of this conflict between the old and the new. I'll be frank with you. I'm very torn. The very idea of popularization depresses me completely. I'm not sure we do any great service to history, or the audience, by democratizing everything. It's not some expert's caprice. When I watch those educational programs on the national networks with my colleagues elucidating on Louis XVI, the Commune, the French Revolution, the history of World War II... I'm not sure they're of much use. I understand your reticence. For a great historian like you... Don't start! You think, "He's not buying this shit, I'll butter him up!" No, not at all. You're mistaken. Don't wear yourself out. I'll think it over. It's in your hands. Not to "butter you up" but there aren't many great historians with a Paris specialty. Just out of curiosity, how much do these things pay? Somewhere in the neighborhood of 100,000 euros minimum. Of course, on top of that, there are points. All these people visit the Palais Royal. Everyone has a curiosity about our heritage. Everyone has a right to your vast knowledge. Why wouldn't they? It's appalling what I'm about to say... but I'll do it. French researchers mostly research how to make ends meet. Whatever your motivation, I'd be thrilled. And not just me. The public, too. All these people who... All I know about Paris, I offer to you, ladies and gentlemen. Everything I know shall be yours. Verneuil... I have something to tell you. I'm giving a "Merovingian Update" at the colloquium. What I've got on Pepin the Short and the Carolingians will bring the house down! You're coming? I'm not sure. I have a new job. Oh! I got hold of some coins in Angoulme that completely contradict the theory of direct taxation under Dagobert! Yes, sir! Remember my old professor, Vignard? The thesis advisor who liked you so much. I don't want to become Vignard. He's become this hideous old fossil, rambling on about stuff that interests nobody. I feel like, if I go on like this, giving my little courses, skulking around libraries, consulting absurd archives, I'm doomed to become Vignard - a rat! A rat! Maybe it's na?ve, but I've always thought knowledge was about opening the mind, a kind of awakening. But Vignard scares me. I'm afraid of his obsession with historical minutia, his maniacal, obsessive side. These days, everything seems pathetic to me. You ought to take up squash again! Your classes going okay? Yes. They're fine. The other day in class, I had a genuine illumination. Apropos of what we already know about Haussmann and his rectilinear layout of the avenues, I'd like to touch upon gardens and the relationship between the city and nature. Three students have prepared presentations on three spatial approaches, reflecting three ways of thinking: French gardens, English gardens, and Japanese gardens. Which garden is your presentation on? - French gardens. - Go ahead. When I saw that magnificent girl, I thought beauty really is horrible. Added to youth, it's completely unfair. Almost indecent. I studied her face, her eyebrows, her eyes, her mouth. Her face was sublime. And I thought, why? Why her? Why is she so beautiful? And why are all the others so... not ugly... but, let's say, banal, invisible? There's something horrible... Beauty really is disgusting! Did you see her after class? That's not his style. Well, I almost did. Really? And? Obviously, some kid beat me to it. The idea of waiting on line was depressing. Then I overheard what she told him. What did she say? Laetitia! She said, "0603 "435363." That telephone number was engraved in my brain. Maybe it was its musical quality, with its repetition of threes. Or its progressive quality - Anyway, it was like a magic formula. So it stayed with me. Did you approach her? Did you call her? Worse. I sent a text message. A text message? A text message. I followed her after class. I masked my own cell phone number. She went for coffee and I sent her a text. I pretended to be a young guy. I know. It's moronic. - What? - Why? Because I'm an old fart! Trying to see her seemed out of place. What did you write? I wrote, uh... We R in class 2 gether U R awesome I'm 2 hot 4 U Oh, no. You didn't? Yeah. "U R awesome. I'm 2 hot 4 U." You okay? We just got here. We're sleeping over. Me and the kids. - Hi, everybody. - Hi! Can you say hello? - Hello. - How are you? And you? - What? - What did you tell them? Not much. I'd rather you told them. It's better if it comes from you. What did you say? Well, I said... we were camping out at your place. It's fine! We've gotta be honest and say I'm gonna croak. That's not certain. Then it'll be a nice surprise, if it's not true. We're not saying you're gonna croak. We could say... you can't work for a while because you're weak... because... You can say it's better for you to get your strength back up to confront... No, that's bullshit. They're not dumb! Let's be straight. I think that... your uncle has something to tell you. Okay. Your uncle has... a serious illness. A very, very serious illness. He may even die. That's why we moved into his place. Because I'd like to take care of him. Why are you telling us all this? Because it's the truth, sweetie. Are you gonna die, for sure? Well, no. They don't know. They may cure me. But still... I don't know. Even if I do... We all die! - We all die! - We just don't know when. And we want it to happen as late as possible. But if it happens, it's no big deal. You just have to be prepared. They're in bed. Think she's got a guy? There's a good chance. - Why? - Because she's pretty. And you? How come you don't? Because I did and now I don't anymore. Hey, it's not easy! At my age, it's not... At your age! You're 40. Not some old bag. Things aren't the same at 40. You don't know how men are. They don't like women like me. Women who talk back scare them. They like silly young girls best. Like her! She's not necessarily silly. You're saying nobody'd like you? It's a fact. I'm not 20 anymore. Thank God! Your life's not over. You just say that 'cause you got dumped. No. It's true, I expected more from Fran?ois. We had a baby together. I thought my life would be different. Fuck... work's a nightmare, these days. Lay-offs, paperwork... Your days aren't numbered. You're alive, you've got time! Enjoy it! You're so fucking pessimistic. And for no reason! Elise, you're in great shape. Take advantage of that! Give chance a chance. I believe in you! Your life's not over! Maybe it hasn't even started. - Miss? - I'm responding to your ad. Can you come back this afternoon instead? Yes, if you prefer. Stand off to the side. Madam? A baguette, please. - Anything else? - That'll be all. Eighty cents, please. - Have a nice day. - Thank you. Do you have any sales experience? - I majored in AES. - What's that? A retail and economics training program. I don't need an economist! I also did some internships. I worked in a bakery for a month, as an intern. You like that? Bakeries, all that. That universe really attracts me. It's a universe all right. Hold on... Stand off to the side! - Sir, madam... - A baguette. A "tradition"? Ninety cents. - Are you French? - Yes, ma'am. Really? Where were you born? In Thiers, ma'am. She's from the Auvergne region! That's how it is! Like it or not! That's Paris! Have a nice day. - What's your name? - Khadija. Of course! Take my place and we'll see. We'll be right with you. - What can I get you? - Pastries. - How many? - Four. - This box? - What do you think? A doily! Which ones would you like? Elise! Look at this. My first sweetheart took that picture. Incredible! I gotta go. Look at the time! I'm really late. Shit! I'm off! See you later. Elisabeth Deleforges. Elisabeth? It's Pierre Bellanger. We were in the 6th grade together. Yeah, exactly. I wasn't calling for any reason... Just to say that... Remember when we slow-danced at Beatrice Horn's? I don't know. In 7th or 8th grade. I'm really glad. It was at Viviane Chocas' house? I just wanted to say... That was the first time I ever danced with a girl. And it may've been the happiest moment of my life. That's it. Sleeping outside, it's hard to endure such temperatures, which are... damned cold. Yes, of course. Have you been here before? I feel like... You haven't? Have you tried 115? - What? - The toll-free number. Oh, shit. Meaning? Oh, fuck! Listen, I'm on my way. Rachel! I have an emergency. Can you help me? I'm sorry, sir. My colleague will handle your problem. I have a problem. You'll be okay. You'll be okay. She remembered me. I had the feeling... she was happy to hear from me. She was surprised but... Rinse out your mouth. I was so in love with Elisabeth. I didn't dare tell her. I think she got that. - You think? - Yes. Shouldn't you see the cardiologist? For? You're completely nuts. The heart problem. Pierre's heart. - Take a deep breath. - Yes, yes. It's hard to concentrate with all this commotion. Let me relax. It's your first shot. We'll get there. - Let's go. - Everyone ready? Roll camera. Extras action! It was here, in the H?tel Pimodan, or the H?tel Lauzun, dating from the 17th century, that Baudelaire wrote his famous poem, "Invitation to the Voyage." It was here that the Hashish Club met, where Gerard de Nerval, Theophile Gautier, Daumier, Balzac convened to unite drunkenness and creation. It's right here, under the aegis of Baudelaire, that we begin our portrait of Paris, eternal city. In his preface to Paris Spleen, Baudelaire said that work had "neither head nor tail." It was a modern form of poetry, fragmented, "without meter or rhyme." He justifies his desire to compose prose poems, by saying, "Above all, enormous cities, "with their incalculable interconnections, "beget this obsessive ideal." Today's cities also have "neither head nor tail." Paris is a fragmented wellspring of men, stories, eras, monuments, places... Let us also try to discover that universe in a fragmented way. To discover, in those scattered shards, why, "Here, all is order and beauty, "luxury, calm and voluptuousness." I just had one beer. I had such a craving. With your daily cocktail of beta blockers, Digoxin, Captopril and Carveditol, one drop of alcohol and you vomit. You have to save your strength. You can't live the same way. I get that but sometimes it's hard. We're gonna have to see each other regularly. I have the results of your tests. The whole team met yesterday. All your doctors. Endocrinologists, shrinks, everyone. We've all studied your file and come to the same verdict. Our suspicions have been confirmed. I won't lie. This heart isn't working. We all recommend a transplant. Obviously, we need your consent. It's freezing in here. Is the air on? Or is it me? Don't hesitate to call me. By the way, I'm doubling your dose of Digoxin. That's important. I'm looking for Orthopedics. This is Cardiology. Orthopedics is one floor down. - Thank you. - Hello. Hello. I go to your bakery... where you just... Well, uh... Well... Have a nice day. Come back soon. Call me. We used to have girls from Normandy. I loved them. They're workers! Like the Alsatians. There is a difference. A Breton will never work like a Norman or an Alsatian. They're more... They're tough as nails, those Bretons! Not to mention the Corsicans! All that's to say, guess what? I made a discovery. - North Africans! - Really? Yes, North Africans. I have one here. Khadija. She's a gem! It's true, they are temperamental. But, at work, they're there. They're upright. Hello! They give of themselves. I like that. What can I get you? A baguette, please. And very warm! And a pain au chocolat. Everything okay, Khadija? Why? No, I'm just asking. That'll be 2.40. Close the drawer. 2.40. Punch it in. Here and here. I was sure of it! "Your head, your bearing, your gestures "A re fair as a fair countryside "Laughter plays on your face Like a cool wind in the sky "The sonorous color You scatter on your dresses "Cast into the minds of poets A flowery dance" Who the fuck are you? "Those crazy gowns are the emblem Of your multi-colored nature "I hate and love you equally..." You're not some little asshole, you're a real psycho. "The springtime and its verdure So mortified my heart "That I punished a flower For the insolence of Nature "Some night When the hour for pleasure sounds "I would like to creep softly Toward your precious body "To punish your joyous flesh, "Bruise your innocent breast "To make in your surprised flank A wide and deep wound "A nd, dizzying sweetness! "Through those new lips, Brighter and lovelier, "To infuse my venom, "My sister!" Bones from the Carmes Convent January 25, 1814 Construction of the catacombs began in 1780, just a few years before the French Revolution. The numerous mass graves at that time made certain neighborhoods uninhabitable. Like the current Place des Innocents. They were... The bodies... the bones were moved, one by one... and stacked... stacked... I can't. I'm sorry, I can't. I'm sorry. No offense, but I don't believe in this. I've always found all this stuff ridiculous. All what stuff? Well, you, this... The couch, psychoanalysis. I find it completely stupid. I find it moronic. Really? Then why did you come? I don't really know why I came. But the problem is I don't believe in it. You have to be completely na?ve to do this. To do what? Well, to go there. To tell your life story, your childhood, that whole Oedipus complex thing. "I'm so attached to my mommy. How much do I owe you, Doctor?" Isn't that kind of pathetic? No. I can't imagine that lying on that couch and blathering on for hours about your past can, I don't know, heal wounds. I'm pragmatic. You understand? I'm concrete. All that guru stuff's not my thing. I'm the opposite of na?ve. I only believe in what I see. And what do you see? Well... I'm an historian. In my field, we follow tangible leads. You're thinking, "This guy's really sick." "He's really sick. "He came but he won't admit he's really sick. "He acts like he's in great shape. "He's acting out his defense mechanisms," as you say. Isn't that what you're thinking? I'm listening. If you came here, you must feel that something's wrong. You talk about tangible leads. What tangible things led you here? Well, I... I started a new job a few weeks ago. I'm doing a sort of popularization thing for TV. The other day, I completely snapped. That's never happened to me before. I'm afraid now. I'm afraid. It's an anxiety I can't wrap my mind around. It's weird. I don't understand it. I've always been pretty good at analyzing things. Digging up what's not working, solving problems. That's my basic activity, solving problems. I spent my... I'm sorry... I just can't... It's completely stupid. Crying like an idiot. You're good! You won! I haven't won a thing. You know, I don't take pleasure in seeing you cry. It's no big deal. Yes, some things are a big deal. You've admitted that you're suffering. You've just realized something important. I just realized something? Yes. You've just realized the unconscious exists. It's just given you "tangible" proof, as you say. They say that deciding to see a shrink is already half the battle. Has anything happened to you recently? No. Aside from that new job... Yes. Oh, yeah... Now you'll laugh in my face. I'm not here to laugh in your face. Go on, tell me. It may have no relation at all. Go ahead. My father died a month ago. Okay. Excuse me. Sorry. Come and see. Hold on, that's not it. That's the entrance. I'll show you the lobby to give you an idea. People look happy here. Oh, that's just an animation thing. I went to see a psychoanalyst. A shrink? Why? I'm sorry, I'm stunned. Why a shrink? I'm obviously not well. Nervous depression, I think. You're just fine. You're like me. You're not depressed. I'm not like you, please. And I'm not "just fine." I know that's not a Verneuil thing. I'm different. You've always done what you should. Never a problem. I'm not like that. I've always done what I should? It's always been that way. Even Mom and Dad were like that. You did everything well. I was the pain in the ass, the weirdo, the problem child. If that's how you see me... That's how you are. That's why we'll never get along. We've just spent an hour here and you can't see I'm not well. You can't even see I'm not well. You're blinded by wedded bliss, by your plans to have a baby. Can't you see I'll never make it? I could never be like you. A normal guy. Completely normal. Want some herbal tea? What does "being normal" mean? I don't know... Nothing. Roland said I was normal. He's gotta heal himself. He's not normal! Exactly. He said that, too. He is healing himself. He's seeing a shrink. Really? Why? I don't know. He says he's not well, he's depressed. He said I always did everything well. Do I do everything well? Well, no... That's what I said. Not really. Not especially. You haven't got a clue about lots of stuff. Lots of your projects aren't... Some things you blow completely. Frankly, I think that's unfair. Anybody here? Are you my kids? I have three kids? That's not what I planned. I made a mistake in the blueprints. We'll be Mickael, Marie and Rose. No, I had something else in mind. - Look, it's fabulous. - Yes, it's beautiful. That's not what I designed. I imagined a completely different fa?ade. - Great to see you. - How about a movie? Mommy, look! I love this neighborhood. I love this city. I love this building! It's impressive. So many floors! Think you'll finish on schedule? Great work, guys! So close to the mall. - It's so airy! - What a great vibe! Do you think you're all normal? Do you think you're all normal? Everything's perfect, dear. I'm normal. So are you. Very normal! - Are you okay? - No! That's enough, now! Are you okay, dear? I'm sorry. Yes, I'll be fine. It's you? It's me. Obviously, this is very embarrassing. I don't feel well. I don't feel well at all. That's all you can say? I'm truly sorry. Really sorry. You should be. You're completely nuts! Do you realize what you did? How humiliating this is? It's horrible! What's your trip? You think people are puppets? You smile, on top of it! I'm not smiling. I'm embarrassed. You can see that. Sit down. Please, sit down. I'm really not some Machiavellian pervert. It was just awkwardness. I was just trying to... Sit down. You didn't answer me. What's your fantasy? Manipulating students? Not at all. They've got video games for that. If you're into virtual manipulation. You pick a character and go beep-beep, like some asshole! All done? All done what? Have you gotten it out of your system? Not enough. I forgot it could be so good! Has it been that long? Ancient times! See that old tome on that table? I think the date is marked in there. High Middle Ages! I'd have to give my cock a carbon-14 test. You're funny! No, I'm not funny. I'm incredibly anxious. Like all people who make jokes, I'm filling the void, fear of death. You can be pretty unfunny, too. Are you okay with the student- screwing-her-professor clich? I even like it. And are you okay with it, sir? Please, make an effort. Stop calling me sir. Watch out for cars! Wait, Jules. Simone, I hear you're in love with Nicolas! No, I'm not. - You said you were. - No way! What? Being in love is good. It's beautiful. Yes, it is! What can I get you? I'll take some lychees. A kilo of lychees. In front of the flame. You see? It crackles. Pierre! Is it true there's no Santa Claus? Of course there's a Santa! Who said there wasn't? My friend at school. Your friend's a liar. Who was it? - Kevin. - He's an ass. Mommy, can't we stay up late? We'll miss Santa Claus. Come here, I wanna show you something. What are you doing? Where are you going? Pierre, are you crazy? It's freezing out! See how beautiful it is. See that? See the Eiffel Tower? Santa's gonna fly over it. He'll tie his sleigh to the tower and slide down. It's cold. You see? And then... he'll go to all those houses that are all lit up. - Where will he come from? - Over there. He may come from over there. Look! Behind the clouds. Don't tell Mommy, but I'll wait up till midnight. If I see him, I'll wake you up. Okay! And we'll see Santa together. Good night. This may be my last Christmas. And I may never make love again. I'm doing a survey for... I'm not interested. Wait! I'm sorry. Listen... You're the 10th person to slam the door in my face. It'll be over in a flash. I promise I won't be a bother. - Yes? - Okay. You have a lovely view! - Want something to drink? - No, thanks. I'll just ask you a few quick questions to sort of define your... your profile. Do you live alone? Does that mean you have a boyfriend but you live in separate apartments? I don't have a boyfriend. What business is that of yours? I don't understand... It's part of a... I'm sorry, I'm expecting someone. I understand. So, have you ever... taken part in a charity drive? Oh, that's very good. I'm sorry. I don't have much time. No, but... I'm doing a survey for... what is it again? For nothing. I'll leave now. I'm sorry. So, I'll be going. Thanks a lot, anyway. Goodbye. Since I said I would... Bitch. Yeah, it's too bad. She seemed nice, that girl. I don't know why, I had a good feeling about her. Diedrich claims he's laying people off because of budget cuts. The youngest go first! Precarity generates more precarity! Social action is dead and buried in France. On every level. You still single? They don't come any more single. Even my cat wants to dump me! The socially oriented world is dying! I'm bound to get laid off. I can barely pay my rent now! I'm not even sure I qualify for unemployment. I'm gonna have to move. Outta the city, no doubt. They talk about diversity but to live in Paris these days you gotta be rich! See what I mean? You're not wrong. This is kind of sordid. Yeah, I don't know. A little... You wanna kiss anyway? I dunno. You? Yeah, I think so. No? Why not? I figure, if we both want to... Want to? Go out, make love, live it up! Do you wanna come into my arms? For? So we can kiss. Now? Right away? I dunno. No? Yeah, but... I gotta tell you something. I'm not waxed. No problem. Beggars can't be choosers. You're not taking that off? Maybe later. Sorry. - That okay? - Yeah, fine. Oh, Daniela Life's but a game to you Oh, Daniela But don't you believe That you can Oh, Daniela Play with love Without getting burned One fine day Hey, two filets of sole! Fuck you! Bernard's the best rocker in Rungis! The world envies us that. In the States, they call him The Tennessee Fishmonger. Know what they call me in Tennessee? Le King Size. Know why? Here you go! Thanks, Daniela. From the bottom of my heart. - Can I give you a hand? - Gladly! Stop! Look at this! Look at my wheelbarrow! I just found it in the kitchen. It's nothing... Stop! Stop! Come on, get along! - Come on, wheelbarrow! - Stop! We're just having fun. - Caroline's laughing. - Yeah, right! What's the matter? Caroline, are you crying? Let me go. She's not happy. What? I guess she doesn't like the wheelbarrow! I'll just go comfort her. - What's with you? - You're not gonna comfort her! - Haven't you done enough? - Can't we fool around? - You're screwing up the party! - Fuck off! Can't we have a few laughs? You bunch of jerks. Let him go. Two kilos is too heavy. One kilo's lighter but you only get half as many. That's why I can't decide. Take two kilos. We'll deliver 'em. Really! Would you do that? - Today's a holiday! - Thank you! So, we're in the same business! - What do you do? - Social worker. Step right up! Buy your fruit from the social worker! Two kilos: Free delivery! She's nice, she's cute! Step right up! Get your smelly fish right here! Caroline, deliver this to the lady. Getting some cash for me? Yeah, right! There's not enough in your account! The gentleman's a gigolo, to boot? I didn't know. Cut it out or you'll end up crying. You like that, huh? You're good at that! I love it. - How you traveling? - On foot. Bernard took the truck. I've got wheels. Your place or mine? Your place but I drive. Right. Your place it is! But I'm giving you a lift. No, hold on. My place, okay. But I drive. Okay? What are you doing here? I brought you this. What is it? The view from your window. You're completely nuts. Wow, what a difference! You wear glasses now? I'm getting farsighted in my old age. It's so weird. You getting older. To me, you're still a little jerk. You're more attached to the past than I am. - Why do you say that? - I don't know. You kept all our childhood pictures. I don't have one. So I came to divvy up stuff. I give you that in exchange for a few old snapshots. Don't start blubbering, please. You really are an asshole. What's with you these days? I don't know. I think it's that girl. I'm in love. I'm in love. I feel like I'm 15. You see? As strong as Descartes! The same intensity. I love it! Dance some more! I'll dance for you. Check out the sax! Teach me that. Teach me that stuff. - You've got a job. - Great! Ciao, beautiful! Thanks, Maurice. Wait! When can you start? Whenever you like. I'm as free as a bird. - Monday morning? - Sold! What is this mess? Oh, that's horrible! Holy shit! - You okay? - No. It's fucking tough. It's crazy. I thought she was outta my life. She dies. Bam! And I see she's still there. It's so fucking weird. You split up, hate each other even. But something lingers. People die. But something's still here, like a ghost. That's not all. Look at this. How many tangerines? Right, avocados. - You're gonna scatter the ashes? - Who else? Franky? Yeah, but... why from the Montparnasse Tower? When we came from Brittany, that's the first place we went. Take over, okay? Excuse me. You wanna go for a drink? I'm sorry but... Really. Something's wrong... You know this is completely stupid? Sometimes it's fun to be stupid. I don't know. So we act like two dumb tourists? Since you said you were going to Montmartre, and I'm looking at Sacr?C?ur, I just wanted to say I'm thinking of you. A big kiss... Kisses! Roland! We're almost ready. Be right there. On a clear day, you can see Europe out there. We'll try crossing again later. Is it really worth it? Unfortunately, brother, yes, it really is worth it! - Is that a new perfume? - Yes, Dior. J'adore! Beno?t? Hold on... Oh, Beno?t! How are you? Fine. I just wanted to say I'll be in France very soon. You're coming to Paris? Great! That's great... I can't really talk now. Okay. Bon voyage! Hi! How are you? You look fabulous! Goodbye? I wanna go play. - Where were you? - At the market. Why? Illegal immigration tragedy off the island of Mayotte. Coast guard reports What's the matter? Stop! I'm going stir-crazy. I can't take it anymore. I've been alone all day. Where are all those fabulous friends of yours, who are so nice, who are better partiers than me? I don't know, at work. Do you have to say it like that? I know I scare people off. I'm well aware of that. I don't know who my friends are. Fifi came to see me... Diane obviously can't deal with it. I'm sorry... - I almost even called Mom. - And? No. Impossible. Want me to throw a party? What? You? A party? Fuck off! Don't touch me! I'm sorry. - Where are you going? - Fine! Fine, fine! I got it! Fuck off! What did he say? He said, uh... I don't think 10 euros is expensive. So, Patricia, Virginie, this is Rmy. Hi. Pleased to meet you. We went to see the new show at Beaubourg. It was great. Shit! I wanted to see that. - I forgot to call you. - Slut! It's Roland. I know. Why'd you ask me to come? So that... So you'd see my life. Look, it's no big deal. Yes, some things are a big deal. - Hello. - Hi, Diane! Long time, no see! Glad to see you! Bravo! - I can't do that anymore! - Hello, anyway. You okay? - You didn't get hurt? - No. Patrice... Pierre. - Hi, Patrick. - Patrice. - Shall we have a drink? - Yeah, great! - I can't do that either. - Shit! Are you Pierre's sister? You're Pierre's sister? On line for the? Thanks for coming. I'm happy to be here! Diane, I... You... Stop. Stop right now. Don't say anything heavy. Not tonight. Let's dance. We can piss later. We said one glass of champagne! We didn't drive out to Rungis for one drink! I see that. How did you think of this, Suzi? Bring it back! Franky! Look at this. Hey! Look! He's calling his friends. That's funny. - Look at them. - They're cute. Bernard, Jean! Look out there. Mourad! Invite them for a drink! Ladies, how about a tour? Careful! A turn! Can't I ride with you? If you like. - Now what? - I dunno. What do you wanna see now? How about meat? Really? You're into meat? On adore le meat! Here we are! Leave your flowers. You can't come in here dressed like that! Why not? A white smock, minimum. It's a food safety zone. It's a question of hygiene. She's a lady butcher. Thanks! Come on! Let's dance! You've got no choice. On the dance floor, wallflower! No... More! This is where all the fruit stuff happens. We get our stock here. Pretty much every day, very early. That's the best tangerine dealer in Rungis. From all over the world. From Corsica... From Lebanon, Israel. All side by side. Yet, they get along. If only people were like that. It's cold. It has to be. Keeps the fruit fresh. I shop online. I never imagined a place like this, with miles of fruit, vegetables... all different. It's fascinating. What's fascinating is shopping by internet! Come on, I have lots to show you. Things okay with him? Wanna get back together? You're very beautiful, miss. I heard you get steamed, when they call you "ma'am." Is that your usual pick up line? It's pretty infallible. I know what women like. You'll have to tell me because I don't know what I like these days. I have a hard time with men. Really? Have you tried homeopathy? Homeopathy. That'd be men, but in teeny doses. That wasn't too good. No, it was really awful. It's cold. Let me see. Those are working hands. Gotta schlep those crates. See, homeopathy's good for you. It's sure been a long time. Really? I'm sorry, I don't want to. Why? Is it... It's not you. You're beautiful. You're magnificent. Fantastic, even. That's just it. I don't know... I don't know if I like it when it's that fantastic. I'm sorry, but... What? Don't you want to? Yes, but... No. Your place or mine? Did I do something wrong? It's not you. Not ready yet? You're early today. To be honest, I haven't been to bed. That makes two of us. It shows. Thanks, that's nice. Next time, let's do it together. Do? I'm sorry. Not sleep? You're asking me "not to sleep" with you? Well, yeah. Sort of. What are you doing after work? Do you? I have to pick up Lauryn. I picked her up. She's with my kids, over at my brother's. Thank you. It's fine. He's pretty good with kids. Don't hurt yourselves. We're dancing to punk music! Get in there. - Don't you wanna dance? - No, go on. - Go for it! - We're dancing. Go for it. Like this? Jules, get in there! Arms, head, in all directions. Left, right. Go! Go! Go! Jules, get back in there. Give it all you've got. Really? Yes, I understand. Yes, Dr. Ferrand explained all that. How much time do I have to get there? Okay. Okay, it's here. You're sure? You really don't want me... I'd rather you didn't come. I feel like I'm going to the gallows. No drama, no goodbyes, no kisses. If you say so. I'll see you again. One way or another. Please, stop. I'm going. Thank you. Thank you, too. Do you want to hold him? Very good. Roland? I'm a father! I'm happy for you. I'm happy for you. You going away? See you soon, I hope. I hope so, too. - Did you order a car? - I'm going to Montrouge Hospital. Richard Lenoir's jammed. A demonstration. So... Mind if I avoid Voltaire and take Mnilmontant, Philippe-Auguste, Nation and Faubourg Saint-Antoine? No, that's fine. I don't think they've reached Bastille. We may get through. They're gonna give us shit all day. That's Paris! No one's ever happy. We grumble. We love that. The demonstration, you mean? Yeah, right. They don't know how lucky they are. Walking, breathing, running, arguing, running late... They don't know how lucky. To be just like that, carefree in Paris.
