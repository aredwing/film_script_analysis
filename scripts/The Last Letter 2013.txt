My dear Michael, thank you for inviting us over to Sunday dinner. I enjoyed meeting your mother. Although, I'm not sure how she felt about me... Hopefully, in time she wl learn to love me. as I lay here watching you sleep, I realize I'm in love with you. I'm whispering in your ear, "I love you. " My dearest Michael, I've written so many letters, but tonight, I can't find the words. I guess that means it's time to stop writing for a while... tomorrow, I'll be Mrs. Michael Wright. Sometimes, I feel like I don't belong in this world. But those feelings wont last forever. One day, I'll be a bride with a pretty white dress, and pretty hair, with a church filled with all of my friends. I'll marry a handsome man with strong eyes who will be a hard worker and he'll take care of me. And, we'll have lots of babies. Lots and lots of babies. Catherine and Michael have prepared their own vows. My beautiful Catherine. Here on this day I stand a man deeply rich. Above all other blessings, you are my greatest gift. I am honored and humbled by your commitment to me, and in front of God and in front of all these people, and in front of Pastor, - I commit my life to you. Michael. You're everything I prayed for. You are beautiful and you take care of me, in ways that every woman dreams of. You are my blessing. I wouldn't want to live this life without you. And... I long to culminate our dreams, with a child born from this love. You've saved me in ways you'll never understand. My one desire is to spend every day from now until eternity loving you. This is the beginning of your lives together. Love each other through everything. I want everyone in this room to stand and extend your right hand to this couple. This is your covenant with them. To support their union. With the authority granted by the only true God, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Thank you, Pastor. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Wright. I'm sure we're okay. May a mother dance with her son? Of course, Mrs. Wright. Well, you're Mrs. Wright now, as well. Mother. You look so handsome. May I? - Yes. - Mmm. You have made the worst mistake of your life. Come on, Mom. Don't do this in here. Well, you don't give me any choice. You don't return my calls. I've barely even seen you since you got engaged. Mom, you've been nothing but negative. Why would I return your calls? I am simply being honest, sweetheart. Somebody has to have a clear eye on this. We don't know anything about this girl. Nothing. - Mom, I know all I need to know. - Hmm. Okay? I know she loves me and I love her back. What else should I know? Please, don't be so naive. All this puppy love is for peasants, sweetheart. Oh, thank you for that lovely dance. - What I gotta do is top my wife up. - All right. Hear ye, hear ye. All right, I got it. Speech here, speech. A little something... Uh. Today, these two lovers begin their lives. Although I introduced them, I like to think of myself as just a tool in a divine plan, you know? I know I'm a tool. I know people think that. But this is different. Um, from the bottom of my heart, I wish you both a lifetime of love, friendship and happiness. - Cheers. Here's to you guys. - Brother, thank you, man. - Happiness. - Cheers. Cheers, here's to them. Cheers. I... I hope you don't mind me coming. Oh, you know, I get it. It is a bit unorthodox. Your ex-fiancee show up to your wedding. Hmm. I just wanted to stop by and say congratulations. Thank you, I appreciate that. Catherine? Honey, what's wrong? Are you happy? Excuse me? Are you happy? Happy doesn't describe what I feel. Good. That's what matters. I haven't slept in a month. - So, I'm just stressed out, I think. - I know. I just hope your happiness lasts. We were happy once. - We were happy once. - You remember? I do remember. Yes, I remember. Enjoy your day. It's your day. - Thanks, Claudia. - Oh, baby. Good morning, Mr. Wright. How are you? - Good morning, Julie. How are you? - Good, good. You've got several messages on your desk and one is highly urgent. - Highly urgent. - Yes. - Let me guess. Mother dearest? Yup. - Sounds like it. David, all right. I'm doing all right. Hello? Ms. Clark? No. Catherine Clark? But... Uh, that's my maiden name. How can I help you? I'm Mr. Tines from Firestone Insurance. Okay? May we speak? One moment. Hello. May I come in? What's this about? It's about the fire at the Smiths' house. You were one of the foster children there, yes? Yes, but that was some time ago. May I? Case number X-3052, March 17th, 2012. With Catherine Clark, now Wright. I'm sorry, what is this about? Oh, we're reopening the case. But... I'm not sure why you need my help. That was almost 20 years ago. The Smiths' son recently came into some money. He hired me to investigate. He never believed that it was an accident. And, the Fire Marshal's report was inconclusive, at best. So... Still not sure why you need to speak to me. You were there. What I am specifically interested in is what happened before the fire? Claudia and I were upstairs, doing our homework. George and Mr. Smith's son, Nathan, were downstairs, watching the football game. That's it. Right there. The official police report states that you and Claudia were the first two out the house. Yes. That's right. How were the two of you down the stairs and out of the house before the guys who were downstairs by the front door? Well, the TV was loud. Mr. Smith liked it that way. He had that TV on so loud that you couldn't hear anything, anywhere else in the house. Hmm. How'd you know about the fire? I could smell burnt wood. But no one else could? Okay, um... What happened when you went downstairs? Well, I told Claudia that I smelled something. So, we went down the stairs. And, when we got down there, the door was closed to the den where the guys were. I could hear the game. It was piercing through the walls. And, um, we went back to the kitchen and that's where we saw the fire. Then we went down to the den and started pounding on the door but they couldn't hear us. You know, Mr. Smith always kept that door locked. He didn't like to be disturbed. How'd you finally get their attention? We went outside around to the back and we saw them through the window just oblivious, just laughing and smiling. So, Claudia finally threw a rock through the window. And then they tried to open the den door but the flames were everywhere. Is that when Mr. Smith broke the glass in the window? That's right, yes. And what happened then? Well, he helped George and Nathan out first but by that time the flames had risen all the way to the upper floors. And the ceiling came down on Mr. Smith. Hmm. And where was Mrs. Smith at this time? She was working. She worked nights at the local diner. Okay, um... Fire Marshal's report states that the fire started in the kitchen. But no one was in the kitchen. Correct? I don't know about that. Okay. Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. Mrs. Clark, I mean... I'm sorry, Mrs. Wright. Wright. One more thing. Your medical history. Yes? There's some indication that you suffer from some severe sleep disorder. I used to. But not anymore? Yes, that's right. That's all. Um, you have my card, so if you remember anything else, feel free to give me a call. I'll show myself out. Michael? Mr. Haynes. Update me. On the Kohler Project. Well, you'll be happy to know the Kohler Project is all but done. The designs look absolutely amazing and, uh, I think the client will be pleased. You have a good team under you? I have a great team, sir, actually. They are great because of you. Wars are fought by soldiers. But they are won by thinkers. Thank you, sir. That means a lot. The firm is downsizing a bit. To cut costs and bolster efficiency. We're trimming the fat, so to speak. Becoming more lean. Okay. I want you to cut your team to two. Sir, you're asking me to let go of three people? I thought the company, though, was doing pretty good. Three of Bill's clients have declared bankruptcy. And the Donner building never got its funding. We all have to sacrifice. And I know I can count on you. Of course, sir. Absolutely. Additionally, I would like you to mentor my nephew who I think has great potential. These are partner level decisions, Michael. A man's character is revealed in famine. Not in feast. Babe, I'm home. - What you smiling about? - Mmm. - Go wash up for dinner. I knew I married you for a good reason. Babe, can you tell me how these idiots expect me to do the same amount of work with less people? Well, companies are cutting back all over, honey. It's all over the news. Yeah, but, babe, we're already understaffed as a company. Doesn't make any sense. Maybe it's a test. And, I mean, I already handle the most important projects. You know, I handle all the most complex designs. All of that's me. And then he did that thing again where he dangles the partnership over me. He think that scares me or something? Horrible. Michael. It's a game. Play to win. - What would I do without you? - You like that, babe? - I like that. Yeah, I like that. Want anything? No, thanks. Oh, before I forget. Remember we have dinner tomorrow with Bill from the firm. 8:00, babe. Oh! So, Catherine, I have to tell you I cannot get Mike to shut up talking about you. And why should he? You know, if you ask me, a man should be singing the praises - of his wife every chance he gets. - Absolutely. - Good. - I'll say. Michael is incredibly blessed to have a woman put her dreams on hold, stay home and see to his every need. - Mike's gotta be pulling in the big bucks. - I know. Yeah. Okay, I wish. It is not that easy in today's economy. How do you feel, Catherine? Uh, about? About not working, of course. I work every day. I cook, I clean, I manage the household expenses. Oh, that's right. Now that's the real work, honey. What do you do, Cheryl? - She's a blood-sucking attorney. - Oh, Bill. I wish I could get her to stay at home, but it's not gonna happen. - Uh-uh. Never, never gonna happen. - Never? So, Bill, I'm curious. How many... How many they make you let go of on the team? - None. - Really? Yeah, I mean, why? Because Mr. Haynes said all the teams were downsizing, so... You have a team. First I've heard of it, really. But, guess you're gonna have to get back to work sooner than you thought, Catherine. - It's all over. - Okay, enough about work, Bill. So, Catherine, that dress is so nice. - Uh, your... - Check, please. You think I'm a burden? What? I can get a job, Michael. You want a job? I want a baby. - Catherine. - I want a baby. We talked about this. We said we would wait two years, it has not been two years. It's just, I'm ready now. I've spent a year waiting. Well, I don't think I'm ready for that, babe. Michael. I'm serious. I got loads of stress at work. We just talked about it at dinner. The company is downsizing. They're not looking out for me and babies cost money. We gotta be smart about this. It's not just your decision. Well, it's the last thing I wanna talk about right now, okay? Catherine? Baby! Catherine? Baby, you hear me? Catherine? Catherine! Where is she? Catherine? Where is this woman? Baby! Catherine, I'm calling you! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine, get off the street! Babe. Babe, are you all right? It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. Let me get you a towel. Okay, come on. Gotta get you out of those wet clothes. There you go. Oh, babe. What happened, babe? I don't know. I don't want to talk about it. Okay. But you gotta talk about it, baby. You have to. You were in the middle of the street, babe, in the pouring rain. You could have been killed. And I could have been killed. You're gonna have to talk about it. I have a sleep disorder. Like, what do you... It only happens when I'm under a lot of stress. It's embarrassing. It's not embarrassing. It's dangerous. It's not embarrassing. You have to be able to talk to me. I'm gonna get you another towel, okay? Thank you for waiting. So, uh, please help me understand what's happening. Yes, of course. There are several stages of sleep. One, which is a light sleep, which you drift in and out of. And then REM sleep, which is your deepest state of sleeping. Sigmund Freud believed that dreams were safety valves for our subconscious desires. In other words, it allows us to act out things in our dream world that wouldn't be safe to do in the real world. You see we have pons in our brain that send signals that cut off neurons to our spinal cord, which is why you normally can't move when you dream. A sort of temporary paralysis. I was standing in the rain. I mean, why wouldn't I wake up? Yes, well, sleep and dreams are just recently being researched effectively. But what we do know is that whatever you subconsciously believe to be real when you dream, is. I'm prescribing something stronger for you. And it should help you to sleep, and stay calm. Are there any side effects? A little drowsiness from time to time, but other than that, you should be perfectly fine. Thank you. You're welcome. Good luck. What's up, little girl? - Hi, George. - Hey. So, what happened? What'd he say? He just prescribed stronger medicine. That's cool. If you actually take it this time. I know. Hey, you got everything you've always dreamed about. Everything you've written in your letters, you have. Don't screw it up. Take your medicine. Okay. Remember, you, me and Claudia used to sit around and talk about who was going to get married first? Yeah, I do. I always thought it was going to be her 'cause she's the prettiest. I'm the prettiest. No, I knew it was going to be you. You were always the best. George, an investigator came around asking questions about the fire. Who? Did he say a name? I think I have his card. What did he ask you? What does he know? It's okay. I'll take care of it. I love you, George. I love you more. Let's get you home. That was Myracle Holloway and L'Marco Smith, from the Marriage Chronicles soundtrack with, What Happened? It's a sunny 80 degrees here in Southern California. This'll be your only warning. The Smith case is closed. Walk away, you understand? Walk away. Tap the dashboard three times if you understand. - Hey, baby. - Hi. Hey. What are you doin'? Oh, baby, I'm tired. I guess you're not tired. - Are you tired? - I'm tired. - Are you? - Yeah. Hey. Michael. Ohhh. Ohhh. Mmm. Fuck. - Wait, baby, slow down. Baby, slow down. - No. Don't hold it. - Ohhh. Slow down. Slow down. - Don't hold it. Catherine, slow... Ohhh. Oh, fuck. What did we just do? What did we just do? Ohhh, fuck. Ah, yes. Yes! Look at the pretty day. It's a gorgeous day. Hmm? Hello, gorgeous family. - I love you. - Love you more. And Daddy loves you. Daddy loves you! I love you, Daddy. I gotta go to work. Oh, can't you just play hooky? One day? Hmm? Soon. As you can see, the numbers have definitely gone up since the last quarter. Michael, you have done an amazing job with the Kohler Project. You did in three months what would have taken most five. But I am most impressed with what you have done with my nephew, David. And so today, we want to reward you by promoting him to manager. There is no greater reward for a teacher than to see his student succeed. Thank you. Ma'am, it's Detective Snow, can I speak to you, please? There's been an incident that I'd like to talk to you about. Well, how can I help you? Last year, were you visited by a Mr. Tines? It says here that you were one of the last cases he was working on. He was murdered last week. Oh, God. Where were you on the night of April 5th? April 5th, I was here with my husband. The entire night? Ma'am? Yes? Were you home the entire night? Yes, I was here with my husband. Do you know a George Carter? I do. What's your relationship? He's my foster brother. I'm going to need you to come on down to the station and make a statement. I just gave you a statement, and I can't leave. I have to stay and tend to my baby. Do you know where I could find this Mr. Carter, George Carter? No. Okay, well, thank you very much for your time, and here's my card, in case he tries to contact you. Shh, shh, shh. Come on. Sush! Shut up. Hey, Cat. George. Don't worry about anything. I'm gonna take care of it, okay? You just relax. I'm fine. I'll take care of everything, baby girl, okay? Tell me that you didn't. I can't talk to you right now, I'm a little busy. - Geor... Shh. Just quiet down. Come on. Very nice. You wish your husband came home and did that to you. You just relax. Catherine. Catherine. Hey, babe! Hey, April! Baby, what's going on? ...What? You should stay down, you shit. Well, now I'm really excited. Your nipples are hard. You're so beautiful. Shh, shh, shh. Babe, babe, it's me! It's me. It's me. Shh, shh, shh. Hey, babe. We're home. We're in our son's room. It's okay. Come here, I've got you. What was that last night? What was what? What do you mean, "what was what"? What happened in Samson's room? It's nothing. Catherine, come on. You know what it was. I thought the doctor said the medicine would take care of that sort of thing. I stopped taking the medicine. You what? I can't take that medicine and nurse. You gotta take the medicine. It might hurt Samson. We don't want that. Do we? We'll talk about it later, when I get back. Thanks for breakfast. I gotta go. Daddy gotta go, Sam-Sam. You be good for Mommy, okay? You be good, you be good. Thank you. Have a good day. Is Mike in there? - Okay, thank you. - Hey. What's up, sib? - How you doin'? - What's up, G? Very busy. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, man. You got no time for family anymore, man? I know I owe you lunch. I told you I promised you lunch. I've just been busy. Look at all this crap, projects and deadlines. Wow. Well, I hope married life is treating you better than this, man. Catherine's just worried about you, so I thought I'd check in. Worried? What do you mean? You know that girl loves you, man. She'd do anything to keep you happy. Yeah. Look, G, no offense, uh, but what happens between me and my wife, I think it should stay right there, between me and her. My bad. I just care about the both of you, so... Okay, Momma's here. Momma hears you, Samson. I know. I know, okay. Come here. It's okay. - Tell me something. - Mmm-hmm? What's up with her sleeping problems? - Her sleeping problems? - Yeah, sleeping problems. - Probably nothing, man. - What do you mean, "nothing"? Well, come on, man. We all have something that we don't want to tell everyone about. You know? What about when you were in college and your scholarship money didn't come through, so I had to loan you 5,000? I mean now, you got a big job, you got a big office. So, you want that back, huh? You want the money back? I care that you have a good job and that you're taking care of your family. Hello? Catherine? How... How did you get in here? You have a key? Oh, of course Michael gave me a key. Well, I'm sure it was for emergencies only. Well, when you didn't answer the door in a timely fashion, I assumed something was wrong. No, I was cooking, and then I laid down. I didn't hear you. You cook? Oh, how nice! Domestic. Well, anyway, I'm here. Well, have a seat in the loft. I'll be right back. Thank you. You seem uneasy. Oh, no, I'm fine. Are you sure? Have you slept? The baby has colic and... So, I'm just up a lot. You know, I'm so sorry that I interrupted your day, but since it doesn't seem to be the priority of you or my son that I get to see my grandson at all, I'm sorry. I took matters into my own hands. Um... That's not how it is. Mrs. Wright. Oh, my goodness. Look, can we get rid of the formalities? You treat me like I'm a stranger. I'm sorry. Lorraine. Thanks. Well, to be honest, I think, um, being a stay-at-home mother has been a difficult transition for me. Oh, my God. Funny. I guess it's tragic going from waiting tables to being taken care of. Let's be frank, Lorraine. Please. I know you think Michael made a mistake marrying me. I do. Well, I'm not the mess that you think I am. I pray you're not. Now, would you please bring me my grandson? Morning. You know what, baby, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late. Okay. All right. Okay. Mama's here. Oh, please stop crying, Samson. Okay. It's all right. Oh, Mama's so tired. I know. Ah, here he is, gentlemen. Yes, here I am. Uh, I apologize, first and foremost, for my tardiness. I'm sure you will make up for it by wowing us with your new design. Absolutely. Just as, uh, as soon as I find it. I do thank you for your patience. Michael, we don't want to waste any more of these gentlemen's time. Do we? No. Um, essentially, we're simply expanding on the previous designs that we talked about before. Wait. I don't need it explained to me. I just want to see what the buildings will look like. I wanna see the designs. Indeed, Michael. - Mmm-hmm. - Where are the designs? The truth is, gentlemen, I had a, uh, emergency this morning at home. I'm sure we can all relate, and I left the designs on the hard drive at home. If I may, Michael, uh, why not just call Catherine and have her email over the presentation? Two minutes, Mr. Haynes. Just give me two minutes. Thank you for your patience. Two minutes. Two minutes. Thank you, sir. Come on, babe, pick up the phone! What the fuck happened, Mike? I don't know. Well, is Samson okay? Tell Mr. Haynes I had an emergency. - Michael! Catherine! Catherine Wright! Where's Samson? Catherine, what did you do? What did you do, babe? Where's my boy? He's sleeping. Oh! - What the fuck is -wrong with you, huh? - What? - What is wrong with you? I gotta help you, babe. I don't know what you want from me, Michael. Babe, I can't help you if you don't tell me what's wrong. You just sit there with this glazed look in your eye. You look like you're constantly on the edge of insanity. Insanity? - You scare me, babe. - No. But you just don't understand. You don't understand. Well, then make me understand! That's what I'm asking you to do. Make me understand. You gotta help me understand. I gotta know that you're able to function with our son. I'm gonna call Mom and, and ask her if she'll come to the house and help out... No! You will not invite that woman into my house. She hates me. Your mother hates me. I don't want her in my house... This is our home! It's not your home, it's our home. You should want what's best for our son. I'm what's best for my son. I'm what's best for our son. I'm his mother. I'm his mother. I'm what's best for our son. I'm the one who's here. I'm the one he needs. I'm what's best for my son. Take my baby. I do everything around here. Take my baby. I cook, clean. Fucking bastards. Take my baby. Who do you think you are? You won't. I won't let you. Baby. Catherine. What? Are you okay? I'm fine. Babe, it's 2:00 in the morning. Take my baby. You all right? Oh yeah, buddy, I'm fine. You don't look fine. I guess it's true, Bill, you know? Things are too good to be true. It usually means they are. Well, I'm sure it'll work itself out. Look, I'm, uh... I'm not very good at this kind of stuff. But, uh... What kind of stuff? What? I'm here to let you go. Oh, Bill, that's funny. I mean, you've always been a valued employee. I mean, you've gotten some of the largest contracts this firm has ever seen. Bill, what is this shit? Mr. Haynes will be forever in your debt. Mr. Haynes couldn't come down here man-to-man and fire me? He sends you? I fuckin' trained you, Bill. You think this is easy for me? That bastard owes me more than a damn package! Don't be unreasonable. I don't need Mr. Haynes' package. And fuck you, Bill! Take the package. Michael! Fuck the package. Ugh. Never mind. We'll take care of this later. Eight years I slaved for you, And frankly, I'm shocked you didn't see it coming sooner. - What? - You got soft! You lost your edge! I lost my edge? You used to be focused! You know this game! It takes more than just talent. You need discipline. That's why you had me train your nephew. Hmm? 'Cause I lost my edge? This is not some moral hyperbole. This is business! - Bullshit! - Business! You fed me some bullshit about a partnership with no fuckin' intention, Mr. Haynes... I don't owe you an explanation for anything. Hmm. - Mr. Wright. Time to go, Mr. Wright. - Take the severance. - Cry to somebody else. - I've got your cry to somebody else. Get out. Fuck! Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out! Get the fuck off me! If I was on the street, I'd fuck your motherfuckin' ass up! Well, you're not. You're in my house. Well, you were. Catherine. Babe? Baby. You killed our son! No! No! I've got it. You know this too shall pass, right? I'll always be there for you, Michael. Okay? Hey, Miss Lorraine. You do your thing. Thank you. Get up. Get up. Son. Mama. You're stronger than this, baby. Get up. Come on, now. Son, come see about your guests. I knew you shouldn't have married her. Do you think God makes mistakes? I do not. Why would he want this to be my life? I'm a murderer. What's done is done. You've got to find the courage, no matter how hard it might seem, to move forward. I know these... These are some tough times. I'm cursed. No, you're not cursed. But we all have our cross to bear. I don't think I can bear this one. We never do. That's why along with the cross, God gives us the strength to make it through. You're gonna get through this. I've known you most of your life. I've seen you dragged from foster home to foster home, but you were always strong. You're gonna need that strength now. And it doesn't matter if the judge finds me guilty because I'm guilty in my heart. You're gonna have to find the courage, no matter how hard it might be, to move forward. Michael. Would you feel better if they found me guilty? Finally over, huh? Is it? Not guilty? Is there anything else? Is there anything more that matters? It hardly seems like a reason to celebrate. What are we celebrating? How fucked up I am? That I would kill my own child and get away with it? - Don't say that. - Well, isn't it true? You could not control what happened. I don't know about that. What kind of mother am I, George? Huh? I mean, wouldn't some kind of instinct kick in? Whether I'm asleep or alive, wouldn't I protect my child? Cathy, you've got to let it go. You've got to move forward. I'm here to support you. Michael's here to support you. Michael can't stand me. No, don't say that. That's not true. Michael barely speaks to me. Cathy, you just gotta give him time. Look, I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you at the trial. I just gotta lay low until things blow over... Mr. Tines. Detectives know. Catherine. It's my job to take care of us, to protect us. Okay? You keep your mind on your family. You, me, and Claudia, we made a vow and we're gonna stick together. Right? Hmm? No matter what. It's gonna work out, okay? Don't worry. How long are we gonna live like this? We can't ignore each other forever. It's been three months. I'm still your wife. I want another baby. I want another child. Are you... Are you crazy? It's all I ever wanted. How are you even asking me this? Michael. Catherine, I can't find a job. How do you expect for me to take care of us and this child you now want? Well, things will get better. And what if they don't? What if things don't get better? I'll get a job. Let me help you. Haven't you done enough? I'm sorry. I'm stressed. George said he would help. What'd you say about George? I told him that money was tight and he said he would help. Don't you ever open your mouth to another man about what happens in this house. Hmm? Ever. What happened at Haynes-Martin? We mutually decided that change would be in my best interest. I see. Look. Miss Gainey, I think I'm more than acutely qualified for the vice-president position. Well, that's a matter of opinion, isn't it? Absolutely, pardon the disrespect. I just wanted to highlight some of my qualifications, that's all. All those are evident with a quick glance of your resume. MBA Stanford, magna cum laude, and it seems that you get the job done. At least on paper. However, I'm not sure you're a fit. The bulk of your experience is at one firm. We are looking for someone a little more well-rounded. I'm sorry. Well, I'm aware that, you know, you're looking to fill management positions and I'm more than willing to work my way back up again. That position pays $50,000 a year. That's a third of your previous salary. Yes, Miss Gainey, I'm very aware of that, but if given the chance... I'm sorry, but that would be really irresponsible of me. I think we're better off finding a more suitable candidate. Miss Gainey, please. Tali, can you send in my next candidate, please? - Right away. - Thank you. Mr. Wright, you'll receive a letter from the HR department. Well, thank you, Miss Gainey, for your time and consideration. What do you mean, "What s what?" What happened? Stop crying! Samson, stop crying, please! Haven't you done enough? Stop fucking crying! Hi. Hey. What happened? Hey, Mike. Come join me. I didn't wanna smoke up your house, man. Whew, rough day? Yeah, you could say that. I know it's been hard on you guys. I was just sitting out here thinking about when your wife and I were kids, we couldn't have been older than 12 when they put us together in that foster home. Crazy old Mr. Smith. Hard man. He was a mean son of a bitch. I'd run away and he'd come find me. Catherine got me through all of that. She set me free. She set us all free. You my man. But Claudia and Catherine, that's my family. And I'll do whatever it takes, whatever is necessary, to protect them. Brother, you come up into my house, offer me a beer, then you threaten me? No, man. I mean it kind of sounded like... Nah, I'm just hoping to open your eyes. She loves you, man. She needs you. I have to call you back. Okay, bye. Hey. Hey. You all right? Yeah. Cat said that I could stay for a couple of days. I hope that's all right. Yeah. It's okay. Thanks. Want something to drink? Nah, I'm good, thank you. Okay. What happened at the Smith house between you, George and Catherine? There was a fire. You know that. What happened? I think that's something that you need to discuss with your wife. Claudia, I'm trying to talk to you about it. Good night, Michael. Yeah. Good night. Hey, you didn't come home for dinner. Yeah, I'm okay. Ate out. You told Claudia she could stay here? Just for a few days. You didn't think it was important to tell me? No, I thought... You thought what? You thought it was on a need-to-know basis? I mean, it's my house, right? I don't... I don't know shit, do I? I didn't know about your sleep disorder, you're telling all of our business to your friends around town... I mean... That's not true. It is true, of course, it's true! - Why are you attacking me? - Because I don't trust you! I'm your husband, Catherine. I should know everything. You know everything now. I know everything now? Okay, what happened at the Smith house? What? At the Smith house, what happened? There was a fire and he died. How did the fire get started? Did you start the fire? Did you have one of your sleep episodes? No. - Huh? - No. Did you fucking start the fire? Did you kill him? - Did you fucking kill him? - No! - Did you kill him? - No, no, George... George did. He was raping me and Claudia and then George started the fire. And you didn't think that was important to tell me? It's in the past. It's over, it's in the past. Just like our son is in the past? How could you say that? And you're asking me, you actually ask me to have another child? You should have told me. You should have told me, I'm your husband. Damn it! It wasn't her fault. Then whose fault was it? We told police that George was in the room with Mr. Smith and his boy. The truth of the matter is that George wasn't allowed to watch the games with them. Catherine and I locked the door. The TV was so loud, they didn't even hear us leave. By the time we got outside, George lit the fire in the kitchen. And this is the first time I'm saying it out loud, and I'm sure it's her first time saying it out loud too. And you all think that makes it all right? I don't know. But I do know that at the time it seemed like our only way out. Y'all are all fucked up. You fucking set a dude on fire, you're all fucked up. You wouldn't understand! Oh, yeah... What the fuck? You killed my grandson. You killed my son. Everything you touch dies. What is this about? It's about the fire at the Smiths' house. Who set the fire? Who started it in the kitchen? Did you start the fire? An investigator came around asking questions about the fire. He was murdered last week. I think George has done something terrible. The medicine isn't working. Did you have one of your sleep episodes? No. Did you kill him? You killed our son! Catherine? Catherine, sweetie, I heard a scream. Catherine. Catherine, what did you do? Catherine! Catherine, listen to me, what did you do? Oh, God. Michael? Michael? Michael? Michael! I've got time of death about 1:34 a. m. Gotcha. Michael! What happened? - What happened to Michael? Michael! - Come on, ma'am. - Michael! What happened? - Come on! It's a crime scene. You can't be here. George! It's okay. - Okay, let's go. - It's okay. It's okay. Michael! No! No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no! Dear Samson, I think of you often and I will never forget your smile. The way you would laugh at the strangest things. I miss your father dearly. Uncle George took the blame for killing your father even though he didn't. The sacrifice he made, I can never put into words. I don't know what the future holds. But I will no longer ty to write the future with my words. I will love you always. This is my last letter.
