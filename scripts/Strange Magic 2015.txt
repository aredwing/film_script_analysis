Awkward. - Marianne slammed him pretty good. - Well, so much for being king. - You think I can't be king? - King Roland! Well... Wouldn't he have to marry Marianne? Yes, and he will. All we have to do is get some of that love potion. - You saying I need a love potion? - No, no, just kidding! - It was just a joke. - We gotta go. Just kidding, boss! Okay. All I gotta do is visualize. Visualize. The crown, sitting right on top...

Yeah. Marianne slammed you pretty good. You got it bad. I wish there was... a way to make her fall in love with me. Yeah. Me, too. Like, I don't know, maybe something like a love potion. - Like a love potion! - Great idea! It is a great idea. Except only the Sugar Plum Fairy can make the potion. She's locked away in the Dark Forest and nobody ever goes into the Dark Forest! But I know you can. But why can't you? Because I'm big! My armor, it's too shiny. I'd be spotted for sure. If only I was little, like you. - And I could blend in. Like you. - I do blend in. Oh, it would have been perfect! Then we both, you know, me and you, both used the love potion. - I'll do it! - You will? - If you stop crying. - What? Oh, I'm much better now. My plan is perfect! All I gotta do is find a primrose flower, get to the castle where I'll find the Sugar Plum Fairy. She'll make her love potion with all the little primrose petals that I... Man, those goblins work fast! Petal, petal, petal, petal, petal. Think quick, think... Duh. All right. A small elf is in the Dark Forest. A small elf is in the Dark Forest. Got it! Thang! Thang! - What does it mean? - I'm listening. News from the mushrooms, sire. You can tell him. - You tell him. - He likes you. - Really? - Now I'm waiting! A tall chef is into shark storage! What? Okay, you know how we sometimes have a shark, but no place to store it? Well, a very tall chef has that very same problem. - That doesn't make any sense. - I'll deal with it! What? That was close. A small elf is in the Dark Forest! Well, if he's looking for trouble... he's come to the right place. Yeah If he's looking for trouble Just take a look at this face Because I'm evil My middle name is misery Yes, I'm evil So don't you mess around with me Don't worry about a thing 'Cause every little thing is gonna be... Woke up this morning I hope I woke up this morning Three goblins Sayin' I'm going to kill you Okay, you got me! Just kill me now. Make it quick. Hey! Hey, wait a minute. Did you tie my... Who are you? Okay, look, you little thing, I'm a guy who usually enjoys a good joke, even at my own expense. But right now, I'm not in a "ha-ha" frame of mind. I'm in an "Ah!" frame of mind. I am on a very serious mission! I really gotta find the Sugar Plum Fairy, the maker of the all-powerful love potion, and you're holding me back. You know where she is? What? Okay. Wait a minute. You ain't gonna trick me again, are you? Good. Because I'm an elf, and we're very trusting creatures. So here's me, trusting you. - Marianne! - Kinda busy. I deserved that one. The Elves' Spring Dance is starting soon. - I want you... - After the last dance? You kidding me? Oh, Marianne. You're... You're a unique girl. And Roland may have a few flaws... - Understatement. - But he still loves you. - He loves the crown. - But... - And his hair. Not in that order. - But, but... But if not Roland, then there has to be someone else! - No, there doesn't. - Maybe if you got out more often. Let it go, Dad. You'll be a stronger ruler with a king at your side. I'm stronger alone. I don't want you to be alone. Dad, I promise if I find a guy out there who takes my hand and looks me in the eye and I don't want to hit him... I'll consider it. But that guy doesn't exist. Then go to the dance to help me keep an eye on that... flirtatious sister of yours. That's my girl! - Did you find him? - I thought I heard something. If you see him, kill him. I won't fit. Come on. She's that scary? Hello? Are you the Sugar Plum Fairy? I expected something more... purple. Hello? - A primrose? - It is! I brought it so you can... So you can make... the love potion. How do you think I got in here? Listen, my name is Sunny. The Bog King won't listen to me about what happened on that fateful day. And I've been locked away for so long. "That fateful day"? You were listening! So I'll do it. - Yes! - If... you promise to set me free! - What? - Shake on it? You can reach in. I can't reach out. You should see your face! Oh, wait. I can show you! Another good one! Wanna see? - No, no, no. - Petal. Plumettes! Believe you me, there can be unforeseen consequences. Like what? Love Love is strange Now's not the time for a concert. Many people Take it for a game No lookie-loos! Once you get it You're in an awful... - What did I say? - No looking... No... 'Cause after you've had it You never wanna quit If you think making the potion's dangerous, wait till you use it. Love is strange Love Is strange I'm so good, it scares me so! - Is the elf taken care of? - He's a slippery little devil. He's just an elf! - Hi! - Mom, no. Oh, relax your thorax. Feast your eyes on... - No. - Maxine's into fungi. - No! - Lakeesha's hobby is killing frogs. - Mom! - All you need is somebody to... Don't say it. What is it with men? They can't say that word, lo... This is what I get for carrying you 23 months in my womb? Promise to stop talking? Love! Once you get it You're in an awful fix - I almost forgot the last step! - But after you've had it - You never wanna quit - Directions. Dust the one you love. Stand in front. Be the first she sees when she opens her eyes. Got it. Dust the first eyes you see, be in the front, and stand on the one you love! Now, pull! - Sunny? - Yeah? - I know what set me free. - Me.

What did you do? Well, the elf asked me to make the love potion. - But you didn't have a primrose petal. - And he brought me a primrose petal. - You made the potion? - Just like I did for you on that fateful day you never ever, ever let me talk about. - Where is he? - Halfway to the Elf Festival by now.

That's true. Quiet! Everybody be quiet! Be quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Sorry. I hope you've got a strong stomach. Sugar pie, honey bunch You know that I love... - You? - Yes. - Antidote? - Working on it. I know she's a girl who falls in love with every guy she sees, - but this is ridiculous! - I... Sire! I forgot to mention, you forgot your weapon upstairs. But I found your boutonniere! - Hi. - You know, I really enjoyed our fight, but I'll be taking my sister home now. Oh, no, you're not! Dawn! - Boggy-bear! - "Bog King!" Let's go back to our cell. Shall we? - Anything for you, Boggy-woggy. - "Bog." - Don't listen to him! - You are not the boss of me! And don't even think about stealing my Boggy! "Bog!" She stays here until I get the potion back. Forget the potion. Get the antidote, now! - Well, maybe you should ask her. - "Her"? Who? The Sugar Plum Fairy. - Welcome! - Give me the antidote. - If you let me talk about that fateful... - No! Then, no. Please! I love my sister. I need that antidote. - Okay! I'll just need a few things. - What? An eye of newt, a golden lute, a loom and a flute. - Get those things. - And green beans, a nail file, a tangelo... Hey, will it really work? - Who knows? - And you are? - My mother. - Griselda. Don't you have a comb? It's drafty down here. Come upstairs. There's snacks. - Well... - Well... I got a feeling It's the best I could do on such short notice. That tonight's gonna be a good night That tonight's gonna be a good night - You two behave. Toodle-oo! - That tonight's gonna be a good... Stop. ...night! Yeah - Go see if the antidote's ready. - Roger, B.K. - And here's your boutonniere. - Quickly! - You sang pretty good. - You should see me dance. Why would she... Who likes this? - Not me! - I hate it! - I hate it more! - Oh, yeah? - They're all fools! - Rushing in. - They can't help it! - They're in chains... - That bind you! - It's nothing but... - Trouble! - It's like their middle name is misery. Well... What's the point? Bursting bubbles! - That's what they get. - Lies and more lies! Pain! - Sorrows! - Wait! I... actually like this one. - Why? - I... I don't know. Well, it's... It's... lovely. - I don't wanna be carrying this. - Antidote's ready, sire. Well? Where is it? - It's a riddle! - A riddle? - What about all that stuff you asked for? - You know, in prison, it's hard to shop! Would you like to hear the riddle, or not? - No! - Yes! Then listen carefully. The antidote is the one thing more powerful than the potion. Did she say "antidote" or "anecdote"? I hate riddles! The moon is sinking fast. Can we go... maybe a lot faster? - Halt! - What? Did you see that? I believe that is the ugliest creature I have ever seen! And it was naked! An army approaches. Got it! Yes! What was that again? - Something more powerful... - ...than the potion. - That's what I said. - Sire! News from the mushrooms! An arm skis on roaches. Carry on! - How'd you do? - I nailed it! - Something more power... - I'm bored! I'll just tell you. - Great! - If you set me free. No! - Okay. - Yeah! Then I will reveal the antidote with a story. - What? No! - One fateful day, when the Bog King was young and impetuous, he fell in love... with a sweet young thing. She was the most beautiful creature I ever saw. Seriously? He was so in love. - But Bog, he had no patience. - That's enough! So, he came to me for my love potion. I tried to tell him how it worked. But he dusted the sweet, unsuspecting creature. Plum, I beg you. As she was gazing into the eyes of a lovesick Bog... Even with a love potion... I'm too hideous to love. You're not hideous. Hideous, not hideous, whatever! But that's not why the potion didn't work. What? She was already in love with someone else! So, the one thing more powerful than the potion is... real love? Bingo! - That took forever! - Why didn't you tell me? You shut me away, and you shut me up! And Griselda blames me for the no-love-in-the-Dark-Forest! Teaching moment. There are no shortcuts to love. Just saying. - Stuff, take it away. - Okay, B.K. Here. Wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute! This antidote won't help Dawn. She's never been in love with anybody. I shouldn't have used the potion on that poor, sweet... - Nothing would have been... - Real. Well... I know all about getting your heart broken. I almost married someone who didn't love me. - Why? - He was so good-looking. Maybe I couldn't bear to see that... he really was a shallow, power-hungry, cheating, chattering, pig son of a... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Inside, I knew he didn't want me to be... - You? - Yeah. But you are... - different. - I've been told. That's what I like! I mean... Well, you know. So, now I keep my guard up. - Me, too. - And most important, - I never... trust anybody! - Trust anybody! Come on. Let's go stretch our wings. Good idea! Good idea. Yes. Here. Thank you. Maybe you should rethink this entrance. Try thinking of this... as an adventure! Nice goblin. - Hey, how about we go back? - Why? The moonlight is perfect right now. Come on... "tough girl." You're waking meadows In my mind Making waves across my time Oh, no Oh, no I got a strange magic - Oh, what a strange magic - Strange magic - Oh, it's a strange magic - Strange magic Got a strange magic You're sailing softly - through the sun - Softly through the sun Of a land I've always known - You fly - You fly - So high - So high - I get a strange magic - Strange magic Oh, what a strange magic Oh, it's a strange magic Got a strange magic - Oh, I - Oh, I - Never gonna be... - Never gonna be the same again - Never gonna be the same again - Now I've seen the way it's got to end Got to end - Sweet dreams - Sweet dreams Sweet dreams Got a strange magic Oh, what a strange magic Oh, it's a strange magic Got a strange magic Got a strange magic It's magic - It's magic - It's magic - It's magic - It's magic - It's magic - It's ma... You... You played me! "Played you"? I don't under... Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. Halt! Disgusting creatures, I come in peace. I must get this love potion to your Bog King by moondown. I will need only three men. My army will wait here. - Sandy. - It's Sunny. - You're in charge. - Me? Look fierce. Fiercer! Wait! - I won't be a fool again! - I didn't know! I wouldn't follow me if I were you, Princess. You won't want to see what I do to them. I won't let that happen. I am so stupid! Execute plan on my code word, "Go." What kind of odious throne is this? Do something! Hold it, whoa, whoa, hold it, hold it. I'm here to give you this. - That is, once you've given me... - Get the princess. You mean the princess-es... Roland! What are you... - Restrain her! - No! Hey! He brought you the potion! - Yes. And an army! - Well... You got me to leave my castle. Clever girl. But wasn't that your idea? It was your idea! And foolishly, I trusted you. Wait a minute. Are you... Are you actually having a lovers' tiff right now? That is so disgusting. It's interesting but disgust... - Roland, you are such a... - Hero, to rescue you from... What did you call him? A scaly-backed cockroach. Is that the guy? Hey, Pare, I can't stand it anymore. I have to go find her. You're in charge. What's going on? Dawn! Are you down here? - Hey, Sunny! You didn't listen! - What? I said, "Stand in front! Be the first she sees when she..." - Please tell me where Dawn is. - Okay, okay, I'll show you, if you let us all out. Which would be so sweet, since this is all your fault! Okay. Yay! My Boggy-woggy Kingy-wingy. I wish I didn't see that. This isn't... I didn't mean for... any of this to happen. Of course... I will be taking both princesses. That wasn't the deal. No! Deal's off. I wanted a wedding, now I'm getting a funeral. - You leave my Boggy alone! - "Bog." What were you thinking? A beast like you falling for a beauty like Marianne. Who's the beast? - Stay out of it! - Hey! I can take care of myself! Two against one? Not fair. Roland! What are you... - Let her go! - You're forcing me to change my plan. So... sadly, now's the time for me to... go! Come on! We gotta hurry! Boy, oh boy, oh boy... Keep it moving! Especially you, Turtle! What is happening? - No! - Marianne! - I have to find your sister. - Okay. And my mother. My life is flashing before my eyes. Hey, I used to be hot. - You? - No time for chitchat. Dawn! Dawn! Let go! - Sweetheart! - I'm gonna skewer your... You will... marry me! Marianne! Marianne! We have to go. - Dawn! I'm coming! - Marianne! Get back! Go! Wait! Wait! Bog! My son. Dawn! Dawn! You're all right. You're really all right. You're all right. Don't worry About a thing 'Cause every little thing Gonna be all right Don't worry about a thing - Sunny? - 'Cause every little thing... Sunny. I love you. - Me? - You. Are you... back? Yeah. But... I don't know how. I know. I'm sorry. - Yahoo! - He's alive! Bog! My precious boy! Out of the way. Move! Move! Move! King coming through. - No! - Marianne! No! No, no, no! Patience. Here we go. Sugar pie, honey bunch - What? - Marianne? You know that I love you That's what I wanna hear. I can't help myself Of course not, babycakes. I love... It didn't work. I wonder why. Gosh, is that great! - I like that smell. Aftershave? - No. - Is that cologne? - No. Well, boys, I've learned a valuable lesson. Never judge something or someone by how it or he or she looks. An elf! - Wait, wait. Body lotion? - No. - Cold cream? - No. - Got it! Deodorant. - It's perfume. Nah. Are you a girl? Isn't it obvious? It's kind of subtle. Are you... okay? I'm fine. Wings, shoulders, head, all good. - You? - I'm good... too. I just wanted to say... I'll never see this place the same way ever again. - Yeah. - Here. It's hideous, but... - Yeah. - Then... Bye! I didn't mean to sound so cute. Cute actually works for you. - You know... - Yes? Feel free to visit whenever you like. Oh. Okay. - Please don't sing! - You know what, Bog? - "Boggy." - It's never going to work between us. - Well... - It's not you, it's me. - No problem. - Yeah, yeah. No problem at all. Marianne, a word. I smell romance. I hate that you always hover and watch and worry! I'm sorry? But I love that you came to this forest... to save me. So, now, I get to lecture you.
