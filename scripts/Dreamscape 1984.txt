This is Alex Gardner, when I was 19 years. I worked with for a year and a half. It was a real genius. Extraordinarily gifted. The Telekinesis was just one of their talents. I remember reading about him. It caused great controversy at the time. And in the middle of it disappeared. If I let things calm down. After months of intensive testing parapsychological... Do not want to be more a guinea pig . And who would like to be? It's perfect. I want. Indeed would be more than perfect. If we found it. That let me to me. If still alive, I will find. And there they go. Prancy Blue takes the lead, Admiral's Runner is second, Completely fine are followed in third. Tracked Cover the Bet, Heavy Rain and High Compression. It is now approaching the first turn. Prancy Blue continues to lead, Completely Fine second, third are followed Admiral's Runner. After Heavy Rain, followed by High Compression who begins to accelerate High Compression attacks now an opening to the first. High Compression comes first. Who would have imagined. Won High Compression. I like this Benjamin Franklin. He discovered electricity. Grasp it. What are you doing here? Is it some kind of pervert? No longer is safe in bathrooms these days. 'Hi, Alex. - Hey, am I looking for? Could hurt my feelings the way in which I avoid. Do not see around here often, but when do you always have the right bet. I think I'm a lucky guy. Not this day. It looks like we have to teach some lessons share your winnings with others. To keep you healthy, you and I will partners. Okay look, you want this? No problem. - Grab the son of a bitch. - Watch where you walk. - Asshole. Cheers, "Partner". ( Hope you enjoyed another exciting day at the races.) (Alex Hi Nancy, we met at the China Club , do you remember? Call me.) (Alex is Eddie. I have to manage your bets for the weekend. Call me.) ( Alex is Maggie, I do not want to see you, I do not want to talk... ) (Alex, Maggie. Call me.) Mr. Gardner? - No, he lives in the... We know you are Alex Gardner. - Who the hell are you? - We are the College Tornhill, I'm Roy Babcock and Gary Finch is. - Little proposition for you. - yeah? Does the opportunity of a lifetime? - Well, that depends on you. Oh yeah, Well um, I think better move the car. Err hear guys, I think the thought better and I'm not interested. Let me not where is parked that Siena. I know this may sound a bit sinister, Mr. Gardner but we have instructions to take it back to us. Am I being kidnapped? There are people in that Tornhill want to talk to you. Oh yeah and they will do if I open this door and jump Huh? I suppose I ought to stop him. Just sit and enjoy the ride. Hey, I can ask you a question? - Go. Am I in danger? - Not us. A and sent my mother understood. I wanted to ensure that complete my studies. Sign here please. - I'm not signing anything not even that this is all about. Then nothing preventing us from continuing. Walking. Sit down, then someone will be with you. -Continue with this, I have a knows that we're watching. Hi Alex, I am Dr. Jane DeVries. I'm glad you could come. Ah, Perhaps you can tell me what the hell am I doing here? - We work on a project. Do you have a tank of geniuses trying to test a new theory? Since age 19 I have not taken part in any event paranormal. What good because we are not interested in gimmicks holidays here. - What they are interested? In dreams. Dreams? Why do you need so much security here? We are cautious, we do not want to leak any class information. Here is our post monitoring of dreams. Hi, guys. All these people have regular nightmares. These people here this phase MRO - Rapid Eye Movement. A dream. That is correct. - I mean, I know a thing or two about it, Dr. DeVries. I still think I have some things to show. So, what is handled in this section? Well here we delve into sexual dysfunctions. See if impotence is physical or mental causes... Watching the man in her dreams. If not physical, the patient has at least 3 nocturnal erections. I see. So Jane what you do here is to have erections. I see will be a great challenge to work with you. - I have not agreed to cooperate. Dr. Devries need a moment - Sorry, I just take a second. Hi Alex, you're late. Novotny, I should have imagined. - You're 9 years later. You left me sitting in Chicago in a Bioalimentadora machine overheated. I was very busy. I did not care that you left, but at least You should tell me that you were alive. I was worried. Worried about me or your Investment in research? Both. I apologize but we both know I'm not good at it .. I spend much time. Good to see you. - I also see you. But was it really necessary to the kidnapping? - Would you have come if you phoned? Nice place you have here. Who is the decorator, Darth Vader? Come on Alex, we should talk. What do you think at dinner with a couple of drinks? Well, but before you jump on the check I want to know some things. I have no intention of spending the next six months electrodes stuck up his ass. Do not worry Alex, you can always go back to your life before betting on the races and courting girls. I will not go into your lifestyle. It sounds as if you will approve. - This right, do not approve .. You have a tremendous gift, son. Do not let it go to waste. Anything else? No, that's all. We get something to eat. Did they wish something else? Let's make a little game. - Okay, it's your party. Let's say a man with the help of science... You can project themselves into the dreams of another person. Ok, pretendmoslo. Then pretend that one time you're in the dream... I again an active participant of the same. What can be in the middle of her sleep. I can actually feel the dream, experience. You can even give shape or alter the dream itself. What say to that? That is crazy. We've done it Alex. And not just once but three times. Using two men with skills in telepathy, similar to yours. Enter the dreams of others? That I have to see to believe. The only thing that really is two people joined at the head to a machine. Because the real trick is going on here. Do you mean that piece of equipment science fiction with the connectors, right? 's Right, all it does is connect the machine your brain with that of the dreamer. With practice you will not need the machine to introduce in dreams. Why me? - Why you? Because you have something that has the rest of us. You can work your way into the conscious mind. When conditions are right and perhaps with a little help, you could enter the subconscious mind. In the world of dreams. And only two people have managed to do this? - Si. Before they meet you .. Listen to Alex, you must decide IMMEDIATELY. Spend the night here. Think about it. Give us a chance. Buddy indicators have increased. - Is it serious? Are increasing rapidly. It seems that the boy has a hard time. How is Simms? - Shows signs of agitation. How is your blood pressure? - 200/174 and increasing. Is the pulse? - 145. It is now almost 147. Brainwaves? - Erratic, should lift. Continue. How is the boy? The pulses are very fast and accelerating. EECS ? - Erratic. Something is wrong, I will wake up. Buddy, Wake we, Buddy, Buddy. Okay, fine. What goes on in that head? In what is so scared? Time to get up. What time is it? - It's early. How do you sleep? Did you have any dreams? I can urinate prior to giving you my answer ?, I'm sorry, force of habit. What was what happened last night? You wear one of our psychics, Edward Simms, connected with a guy It suffers from chronic nightmares. Not that "demons" that guy has in his head but... Was too much for Edward. I think I must be crazy to let me connect to that machine yours. You must be crazy not to. Okay, there are risks, but I think they are controllable. What is the point? I'll be honest. I am doing this because nobody else has. Do not even have conceived before. In fact I'm doing it because it's exciting. I must admit it sounds tempting. But I do not want to get on the carousel you again. Well, try it. I think can really help in this project Alex. What a shame. Also regret this unfortunate affair arrest of the Ministry of Hacienda. What? You see, while you were looking for our sources in the government I took interest to your problems with gambling. I think the Ministry of Finance of going to do an audit from 5 years ago. If you join our program that I could see how help with this. No matter what you do pussy old mother, I will not extort or for you or anyone, understand? I will never do this for you. Not in that way, no way, do you understand? Verde. Verde. Blue. Blue. Amarillo. Red. You're not concentrating. - What is the point of this I have done thousands of times? You hone your psychic abilities. You must learn to achieve a meditative state for engages your mind to those who dream. Verde. Amarillo. Yes. - Yes? If I find attractive. Is that what was being asked right? 's What I thought... - No more Alex. Do not want you reading my mind. How do you think older women heat up? I thought you were going to take this more seriously. For once in your life try to do something positive. Ah yes, the old man: "God has given you a gift" is not it? And everyone deserves a piece of it. Okay Dr. D. Freeze, continue. Do you play music with this thing? - It's a matter of opinion. What Who the hell are you? Tommy Ray Glatman. Oh yeah, Paul told me about you. The Neil Armstrong to connect to dreams. Also it is like walking on the moon. Do you feel good? - You have many girls with a jacket like this. Yeah, I guess. I'm going to put some clothes on and come out to drink some beers Why? - I do not know, that it seemed the correct...... I know what you want. I knew it the moment I saw you. Want my secrets. - No, Not so. I just want some advice. Do not give advice. I do this for myself and that's all. - I'm sorry Novotny let me do what I want. Sure your personality is not Spartan. So I'm the only guy Alex. The only thing you can do. What about Edward Simms? - It's in a basket. Novotny says I can do. I ordered in a basket. Remember, the first time all you will do is make contact. So I want to go into this dream like observer, not as a participant. How brain a kind of voyeur? - Exactly. Hardy is one of the best test subjects. Solo is a builder of buildings, probably 'll end on a bad beer commercial. Anyway, be careful. Paul, I can count bring me back before my ass is in danger? 'll Get you out. Hardy MRO entered the stage soon. You can start breathe deeply. Hardy entered the MR phase. How is Alex? Has a good record in Alpha waves. Ready. Be prepared. Projects. Hey, Hey look. Look, look. Help me. Hold. Take my hand. I slip. I can not hold. Help - me. Hold. Do not let me go. No... I miss... Alex Quiet, quiet. Welcome back. It was amazing. Take off this shit once. Was damn real. Bill, do you remember anything? Alex and I were in a skyscraper. A beam hit me. I was there. I want a CAT-scan and an EEG for Alex in the morning. Bob Blair. It's about time we met. What have you to do with this? - I drive this project to the government. Hold on, Novotny never said it was a government project. - No, and did not need anybody to know. Do not want to publicize our participation in this. Forgive me for not shaking his hand. Hey, and ends here. Would you care to untie the straps? That's not my job. I will have to wait for the nurse. Alex I just want to extend to you my congratulations. Told me about your success with the link with dreams. Well done. And this is just the beginning. We all feel that the possibilities of our program are tremendous and exciting. We do not want to put at risk the work we have done. Bob I'm not following. Well, you have not been slow to let go since you came here. As with these unauthorized visits to the camera dreams, for example. It was very quiet. This must end. Your job here is completely confidential. You'll feel more comfortable once you understand that. I feel much more comfortable if find someone to take me out of this machine. Okay, seeketh him a nurse. -If... Y... Thanks. How you doing? - Good. Not the guy I was with Eddie Simms? - Yes, Buddy is Driscal. What's the story? Take a look. He is tormented by nightmares recurrent terrified him so much that no one dares to sleep. The near collapse and can not do anything about it. Do you mind if I talk to? I would love to do it. Buddy, I want you to know to a good friend of mine, Alex Gardner. Do you also Doctor Alex? - I? No, I'm not. Looking for the same reason as you. How are you doing? - Not so good. Anyone in my dreams. - What if? Who? A terrible, ugly monster. - A monster? I hit, but it is very large. Do you want to hit? - Sure you want. But he spends fun of me. Do you know? When I was a kid, like your age, also had nightmares. Do tapeworms? But I realized that when she told someone me feel much better. So if you want to talk to someone, can talk to me. All right. Let's go back - I'll go with you. Let's turn this train. PUMP is my fault. - Relax, it was only a dream. I can not stand this, it gets worse every night. - Find a solution. Watch your head Mr. Welcome to the White House, Mr Blair. - How is Fred? Not as good as we might expect, I think will be happy to see it. Thank you for coming. - Been a long time, Mr. Chairman. Fred, give us a moment alone, OK? Sit back, relax. Hell, it's good to see you. We've been through a lot and won many battles. Let's talk about your nightmares - They have become progressively worse. Atrocious. I have not slept well in weeks. What about doctors? -They are useless. This starting to affect my work. Is this the real reason you're here? - I'm here because I am your friend. One of the projects that I'm in charge... Contains the best specialists in the field of dreams. I'll be honest with you. I think these dreams have a reason. - What do you mean? Is my responsibility to bring the world back to perdition. This nuclear madness must end. I myself lead the delegation to anger the Geneva next week. John, not mean that. I know that you support with this... But I'll make a disarmament treaty with the Russians. One thing at a time. My first priority is your peace of mind. Mental peace v.? What the hell is peace of mind? I just want these damn nightmares disappear. - That's what we all want. And if I may, I think I can help .. How often this happens, Mrs. Webber? - Something like twice a week. I wake in the middle of the night to discover that George is not beside me. Encentro And always in the same place, the lawn outside the house in pajamas, calling me. When she wakes me when Melanie, I do not remember what I dreamed. Only I have this terrible feeling of anxiety. The neighbors are starting to believe that George is a little crazy. Has lately been under unusual pressure. No, not much really. The situation at home, as you take it? If you mean our sex life, George has had some problems lately. I think it's a fad. Not so, how dear? Oh yeah, sure, absolutely. I'm just a bit down. - Do you have any pressure at work? Your dreams are the key to their problems. I think he sold that Quiff is the key to their problems. You could come and watch her sleep. That would be your first practical application. And when you come? - How about tomorrow afternoon? Right. The EEG is stable. Alex is ready. What Webber? This phase MRO. Alex, get ready. Have you been married? No. Well, it is a picnic let me tell you, have to be watching all the time. My house is as follows I do not want to give warning, if you know what I mean .. Well this is how we will, you see from behind and I enter in the front. And remember, do not take prisoners. Are you frightened boy? - No. Then we go. Over there. Ve Come. Oh my God. - George. Even with my brother. - Hi George. In front of children. I see under there. Phil, Dave, Herby, beautiful friends who are. Good God. Save it I'm Jewish. Sorry Mr. Webber. - You Mr. Fukuda? What do you think? - It is very simple. Mr. Webber suppressed inside an inferiority complex. Difficult because you feel less sexually. In other words... - He believes that his wife is cheating. With this we know already that we face. Now that we solve the problem maybe you can help me Webber with one of my problems. Sure, What's it about? Driscal Buddy, the boy nightmares. I want to go. That's impossible. We have already lost a psychic with this Alex. Do not understand. The kid is going crazy and no one seems to give a damn. This is nonsense. I would be happy to help the boy. Then let me go. Look, our research is to help kids like Buddy, What the hell do we do? This project will not destroy go too fast, you see? O go with Buddy or I get out of the project. Then this out. - I'm not kidding here Paul. O let me in or I get out .. I know I can help this guy. You bastard, you know Alex? I'm doing this against my principles. Thank you. - Do not thank me, this is not my idea. Do you drink? - Please. Do not I have to tell you... it can be a rough trip already that, just tell me I can do to help. There is a tribe in Malaysia. Senoy called. The people of dreams. They believe that the world of dreams is as real as the real world. Children are taught never to lose control in nightmares. They face fears and conquer them. I think that's what you have to do to help Buddy. Whatever your demon. You have to face it. Are you ready, mate. I can tell? Hello - Hello Do you feel sleepy ? A little, but... - What happens? But then the dreams come. - Yes. Want to know a little secret? I will be there. - Really? Yes. really be there. Well, if you're there. And I have something more for you. - Thanks Alex. Alex, get ready. Proyctalo. Buddy you're doing? Are you the nanny Alex? - If I'm the babysitter. They always leave me alone. - Do not have to be afraid. Know Snake Man? - Who? - - Snake Man Snake Is Man? Is it like the bogeyman? This will come out and get me. - The Snake Man. Hold on, hey, hey, I guarantee you will not get you. Let me see who it is. Okay? Please do not open. - Probably not the. You see no one at the door. - Are you sure? He is always there. That's my dad, but he did not help us. The boy is right Come, come. Help me, Help me. You can do it. Kill him... You do Buddy. Again, do it again. Buddy's head, cut off his head. You must now defeat him. It's gone. It's gone. We killed him, killed him. If we did, you cut the head. We did it and left. You did. You killed him. Not even the president can save you from the flu. The president has retired for a few days to his California home. As you prepare for the Conference on Disarmament Nuclear Geneva. The White House secretary, James Nichols, the president announced that will head the commission of peace for the conference. It lasted about a month. What are you a cartoonist? Eh, not only drawing this sleep a child, I really scared. If you listen to that. Have these fools believe that you can walk on water. Think you are probably the most important man around here Almost as important as me. Tommy Do not worry, you're still the laboratory rat Number 1. This thing really scare you is not it? I guess you can say that. I go to town for something to eat. Are you interested? - Thanks, but no. I found a wonderful Italian place where they prepare a Linguini spectacular. I'm sorry I have a pile of work to do. Let me finish with this. I like Jane. I like you too Alex. - Really? But there are two reasons why I will not end up in bed with you. - In bed? Who talk about it? I spoke of linguini. I just want to save the job. - Okay just tell me once. Why not? First, do not want to be one of your conquests. - Not a conquest. This is how I feel, Jane. Second, do not want to risk our work here. The project must come first. Okay. Friends? You are a traitor. I'll get ravioli. To go. You work with Paul Novotny? - Paul who? Sure Paul who. I'm Charlie Prince. - Ah Hi. I get a beer for Mr. here. - Thank you. Hey your face is familiar. Let me see I think I have one here. Do you write these novels of horror? - If that's what I do. What are you doing here? - Research. Yes, I work in a new book. It's about dreams. - Looks like it will be a great publishing success. Look, what is happening here. He is the business of the dream and that you are part of that. Then you know as I do. - May be more. Listen to want to go somewhere with all this because I wish it would. I guess you've found a rate of sophisticated corporate style named Bob Blair. Do you know what you do? Works for the government. - He does more than just working for the government. Is the most powerful man in government. Runs the secret information. The presidents come and go, Bob Blair remains. If it's so powerful, why the hell does losing time in an investigation of dreams? Consider all the deep secrets and hidden dark people at night. Those secrets become visible in dreams. Believe me if a technician would examine those dreams very important for the secret services. Great idea for a book. Right? Still think this is stranger than fiction. Excuse me, I must go. Jane, are you there? Can I have your ticket please? Do not touch me, you had no right to do that - Okay I'm sorry, maybe I overdid a little. - Maybe? Okay, just happened, I can tell, were you so horrible.? It depends on how you look. I know it was a dream and therefore did not, right? -We did not. And we did not should not be upset, but I am. I told you I'm sorry. You should not go begging as forgiveness and should return to your way of being insensitive. Alex what you did was wrong. Do not have to be a genius to know that what happened in sleep was something we wanted them. What to do about it? - I guess I forget. I can not forget. - I'm sorry Alex. Hey Jane, one thing you overlooked. Do not need any help to get into your dream, I did it myself. Paul, tell me the work miracles. Is there any possibility to help the president? The possibility. No warranty. Why did you get involved in this? - We are the only ones who can help. The man is collapsing. There's a man sitting in the Oval Office making decisions based on nightmares. Certainly not be the first leader to take them seriously. No, but would be the first to destroy their country for them. Is not that a bit exaggerated? Do you know what you're trying to do in Geneva? He will expose our nuclear weapons to the world and put our country to its knees. And all thanks to your dreams. Well I will not let that happen. You and I are going to bring the president here. And we will use this everything we can to save it. How are the readings? The blood pressure is 126 over 84. The E.C.G. is normal. Hi. Even these mad at me? - No, but... Dr. DeVries had the impression that we were conducting research science here. Keystrokes are 95, 97. The pulse begins to rise rapidly. The E.C.G. shows very fast contractions. This fibrillating. O God Paul, is having a massive heart attack. - That is impossible. Code Blue, Code Blue. Bring immediate resuscitation unit. What the hell happened? Prepare the defibrillator. Does Bicarbonate? -If I think that had no effect. I have Flat Line. - Too late we are losing. Again. Stay away. Do you have a pulse? - It's okay. Let's try again. Alex, mind you. I would like to be alone. I'm still affected by what Ms Matusik. She suffered from arrhythmia. Damn lucky. To say do not see me but I'm a sensitive guy. I really love. - Has not lost his appetite. How to forget. Off me. Let me go or I'll break your hand. A woman was killed Tommy. Everyone dies. I can tell you a moment? - Sure. This is not the way we talked, is the President to stay in the north wing. Does the north side? Is impractical. I have everything we need. - I think you should change it. I'm sorry but this is my area of expertise, not yours. - I have considerations about which you can not care for. What kind of considerations? - The first is security. Come on this is ridiculous, if you care about security this wing is easier to secure. If you can not take care of the move then my people will do it for you. Behind your litter to Blair? I do not want another debate about this. My only concern is the welfare of the president. Is not that really what you're worried Bob Blair. But is it really the welfare of the president? How is my right hand? - I'm going crazy. This place starts to fall on me. Are not you taking anything? Do not touch drugs. - Good. I have caused much confusion, that's what people tell me. Well, they are wrong Tommy. Need to focus on another person. Yes, I knew a guy like you would understand Bobby Boy. All I do is channel your talent, son. - We need a couple of illusions. Promised me you would have plans for me. I have them and why I'm here. Paranormal Boy kills his father. I'm sorry you had to be in a place, but Blair monitors everywhere. If you know. - I want you to know that you are in danger. What happens Charlie? Do not take seriously last week. But lightning is going on. Things are going beyond what I thought. Mr. Blair is going to extremes. The woman who linked with Tommy Ray did not die of a heart attack. - What are you trying to say? I say that Blair is a murderer cruel . Officially your organization does not exist. Even C.I.A. afraid of the man. - I mean that is training me as a spy? No, no, no he wants more than spies, he wants murderers. Let. Reneen, Charlie. Bastard, you killed him. - Your friend was dangerous, a rookie and have ended with the lid of our project. You killed him. - Yes, I did. You made Tommy Ray murdered woman in the machine of dreams. Right? - If Why? - I was wondering if you could do. You're a real humanitarian. I am a realist. We live in a dangerous and hostile world. And I will do what you have to do to keep this country safe. That's what scares me. You are a very intelligent young Alex, and have an incredible gift. Indeed should consider the possibilities. In the dream Matusik, Tommy Ray stabbed with a knife, a knife of dreams. The shock to the system of Matusik caused cardiac arrest and died. The old saying came true: "In your dreams, when you die, you die also in reality." The big mystery. Now we can go to dreams of our enemies, kill them. Do you realize what this means? - Means no one is safe from you. The question is whether you want to cooperate. I have never doubted Tommy Ray. Why would you doubt it, murderer to his own father, is a fucking psychopath. Alex, is very simple. Work for me or you die. Hey wait. You okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - Good Hey my bike is my bike. We lost. - Si. Must be killed. It has become a risk. Welcome to Thornhill, Mr. Chairman. - Good to be here, Bob. Alo. Jane. - Alex? Listen, Blair is out of control. I saw his men to kill a person right in front of me yesterday. Blair is here and brings the president. The president? How the United States? - If Paul was right. About what? - The president believes the danger. No, you can call the police. Blair own police and F.B.I. Alex? Jane coming back. We have to stop Blair. There is security everywhere. I will leave a door open in the loading dock. I think is your best chance. Be careful. - Do not worry about me. Check keep alive. - You can count on me. Now, now goes to the track. Even I beat you son of a bitch. - Snead. Need to talk to Snead. Hey Snead. Snead. Better be a good thing. Because they would like in your new drive you idiot. I need your help. - And why should I help you? Do me a favor and give you three winners. - Make it six. Five. - Agreed. Some guys come in a few minutes, I'm in a hurry and I want be late for me. No problem. Hey Alex, if not mistaken, you're dead. I can not control the horses, are scared. A front door. Bring more cars. Operator. - Connect me with the room of Fred Schoenstein. No, no, not with the presidential entourage. Schoensteing... - Hello? Paul Is there a problem? What are you doing? - None of your business. Oh I think it is. I'm afraid all of my business now. Can I Apologize? Something affects you deeply... Sit talk about it. Are you sure about that? Let's talk about what you intend to with the president. Did I think that that was clear? I try to put an end to her nightmares. I have no doubts. Blair is out. I'll make sure of it. No one will believe you. - By God, I will believe me. I came to you with a major investigation. To brighten, not destroy. Do not you I provided everything you need? You took something that was vital and very important . And corrupted. You allowed it. Yes, to my eternal shame. Alex, thank God you're here. The die while sleeping, Tommy. After all the stress has passed. No one expects less, so do not worry. We are true heroes. Is not that right Bob? We should be. I got it now. -Ok. I will stay with Blair. Make sure the car is clean. - Ok. Do not get smart or shot, you hear me? - Do not be silly. What does Blair with President here? - No, no. Tests. Alex... What? What happens? Come here. Let back. Slowly. Paul. 'll Kill you, bastard. - I did not. What did they find? Blair wants to free Tommy Ray against the president. Right? Where did they do? Does the camera of dreams? - Alex go. Motherfucker tell me or scatter your brains over the car. The president is in an adjoining room to Tommy Ray. When the president goes to sleep... - I've had enough. We also enters into his dream to stop Tommy Ray. Already sleeping. Do not be long before you start to dream. My office is room under the of the president. That should encourage the link. No lights. Close the door locked. Take your time Alex otherwise... - To hell otherwise, may be too late already. Not Working. Ok, Think about your breathing. Mr. President listen to me. His life is in danger. Bob Blair tries to kill him. What the hell is spoken? He sent someone to kill your dreams. - Who are you? I came to help. Look, all you have to do is wake up. Wake? - That's right, wake up. Try, focus, wake up. I was given a sedative. - A sedative? Then we will have to be careful until you wears off. I did this, what causes it. That's not true. It is only a dream, none of this is real. Hello Mr. President. Alex, what a surprise. Matare two birds with one stone. Ok. What is the problem here? - No problems. No problems at all. - Then move child. Abracadabra. You are a sick bastard. Alex, take heart. Alex is a dream, you can do whatever you want. Had not you noticed that yet? Help me. There is. It was he who pressed the button. It was you, was you, was you. Do you like Bruce Lee? I have seen the Dragon six times. The cagastes Alex. As were walking with Novotny, I learned how to take advantage here. In this world you are nothing Alex, but I am God. End of the line guys. I have something that you dread will indeed Alex. Come on over here. We came to a dead end. We have nowhere to flee. - Then you will escape. Why Tommy? Why I murdered? I loved. Pope, sorry.

It seems that you had not slept at all. - If I slept, but had a terrible dream. This is crazy. - Nonsense is fun, and your sense of adventure? Adventure? Do you call going to Louisville an adventure? - What's wrong with Louisville? I heard there was a great race track in Louisville. Do you plan on betting on horses? I never bet. - So why are we going?
