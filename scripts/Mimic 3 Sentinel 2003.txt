Well, Mom's home.|She won't want me to leave. We can sneak past. "Citizen's Arrest" is on.|You gotta. What is it you want me to see? I think we found a dead body. Going out, mom.|Back in a few. Stay close. Marvin? Oh, shit,|it's too dark to see now, but the body's down there. I don't see anything. It's at the bottom. - You high, Rosy?|- No. It's been, like, two hours. Jesus. Do you think it's real? When did you guys find it? Find what? The body in the sewer. I don't know.|We were pretty messed up. Get doubles of these. I want to send one to the cops. Christ, if I'd known you|were gonna get worked up, I wouldn't have shown you. Did you finish|my biology homework? Look underneath. What do you see? Garbageman. He's new. Garbageman. The dark guy|with the trash bags? He moved in last week|above Birdman. What are you looking at now? Ma Bell. Still yammering|at the grandkids? Looks it. Did I tell you|I met your veiled lady? What's her name? Carmen.|She's a dentist's assistant. Is she nice? Is she nice? Sure. Maybe I'll bring her around|sometime. You might like her. You might even...|I don't know, not die a virgin. Rosy... Unless you're allergic|to that, too. - Shut up. Well, don't be|so hypersensitive. That gets funnier each night. Oh, my God. World's Number-One Dad|just lost his shit. And look. I found that downstairs. Is that Number-One Son? Yeah, and... And I took this two days ago. You see the shadow?|It moved. Oh, my God.|That shadow moved? Well, call the National Guard. Call the Space Marines.|Call the cops. They love this great|fake-detective routine. You're scaring yourself|because you're bored. I'm only looking. That picture is so blurry,|it could be Bigfoot. Hey, Rose. Hey, Des. Check this out. You got any matches? What's up? Dinnertime! If you can stand to be away from|the window long enough to eat. Hi, Ma. Oh, God. What the neighbors must think. Hey, why do you|leave the lights on? So they can see you? Hey, Ma... I seen Rosy with this guy,|and... and I think|he's a drug dealer. Rosy's a big girl. Yeah, but don't you think lately|she's been acting kinda off? You didn't like the lunch|I made you. I took the pills. You can't live on pills alone. Oh, baby.|You're so fragile. You can't afford to skip a meal. Yeah, I wasn't hungry. I don't want to be made|to worry about you like this. Well, I been thinking again|about finding my own place. You know that's not possible. Dr. Carson seems to think|it's a good idea. He sees you once a month.|He doesn't know how you are. I'm 24 years old, Ma. I'll take care of things. Will you finish|your dinner tonight? I can't stay here forever. I love you. Carmen. Carmen,|this is my brother. Marvin obviously knows|who you are. Oh, my God.|You weren't kidding. It's kinda pervy. You got a good eye. I got good subjects. What he's got is a compulsion. How long|have you been doing this? Yeah, since he got sick. I was one of the last kids|to get Stricklers'. You were one of those|roach kids? Well, I prefer "Bubble Boy". Right on. What were they called? - Judas Breed.|- Right. You ever see any of them? No, it didn't work like that. Sure he did.|All the time. Shut up, Rosy. He was on the phone to|the CDC like every week. He thought he was Smokey|the Bear of giant roaches. I was 8 years old. Yeah, try 16. His therapist said he felt bad 'cause they created the Judas|for kids like him. Kill the roaches|that are making them sick. You didn't tell me|I was on here! Yeah... Did you want them back? I mean, do you want them? No. I mean, why would I want|pictures of myself? Can I have this one, though? Yeah, sure. - May I look?|- Yeah, just a sec. What do you see? Des is dealing Ma Bell dope. What's a "Des"? Desmond, her boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. You okay? And Ma Bell. She's always talking to her|grandkids, so we call her that. - Mrs. Leibowitz?|- You know her? I hear her at night.|She's a phone-sex operator. Are you okay? You smoke. What? It's an allergy thing. I put it out|before I came inside. He's hypersensitive. Well, should I go?|I mean, I'm sorry, you know? - Sorry. It's...|- I'm sorry. - I didn't think.|- It's all right. Yeah, take it easy. I think she likes you. Ma Bell's running from something. No kidding. Garbageman's down there. Can you get me more film? I'm busy. Holy shit! What? He's hurt. I think there's blood. Where is he? - Where?|- He's right there. Shit! Jesus, what happened? I don't know. Well, what did you see? Mom? Mom! We have to call the cops. Detective Dumars. Well, thanks for coming. No problem. Simone. Do I know you? Do you want to come in? Yeah. What seems to be the problem? Well... my kids think|they saw something. - Somebody was hurt.|- Killed. My son is a Stricklers'|disease survivor. He's environmentally|hypersensitive. Must be very hard|on you. Yeah, it happened over there,|near the entrance of the alley. His name's Desmond. He was covered in blood,|and then he disappeared. He was hurt? Yeah. Was... anybody else around? He saw the Garbageman. I think I did. Okay.|Okay, I bite. Who's the Garbageman? Him. You took these pictures? - It's his hobby.|- Yeah. I'm not sure it's strictly legal. He's harmless. This guy was at the scene|when... what's his name? - Desmond.|- When Desmond disappeared? Yeah, and there was blood. The rain washed it away. Get any pictures of that? No, I was out of film. Yeah, well... Gee, I wonder what Desmond|does for a living. - Fuck.|- Rosy! Well, I... might as well go have a chat|with the Garbageman. I don't see him. The guy's harmless. Well, who is he? He didn't see anything happen. - Did you get his name?|- Never mind his name. What about the garbage bags?|Why does he only come out at night? Maybe he collects food|for the shelters. What do you mean, maybe?|Did you even talk to him? Marvin. Oh, I brought two glasses. No, my shift|ends in 20 minutes. Is there a Mr. Montrose I should|be getting a statement from? - Yeah.|- No. Cancer. I'm so sorry to hear that. What about Desmond? Your friend, right? Listen, I don't know|what to do, considering. Considering what? Marvin's past. That's where we first met.|The precinct. I took your statement the last|time Marvin witnessed a crime. Oh, right.|I'm surprised you remembered. That must be three years ago. You didn't even talk... Easy, Marvin. Maybe you need to spend a little|less time peeping in on the neighbours. Okay, look, we both saw|Desmond get killed. Rosy! Please. No, no, no.|She seems certain. Are you? And what about you?|What did you see? It looked like|something happened. It looked like|something happened? Are you 100% sure, Marvin? You saw a murder? I don't know. It doesn't sound like|trouble to me, but... I can check in on you|from time to time. Could you do that... Detective? Yeah. Sure. I can put some of my guys|on patrol. Keep an eye on the 'hood. And... call me Gary. No, no, no,|it's not a problem. No? No, are you kidding? Oh, stop. - Rosy, hey.|- Hey, fink. - Hey, Carmen.|- Hi. You okay?|I saw you outside. I'm fine. Is this the thing|about Rosy's dealer? He's not my dealer. Rosy was telling me|about this garbage guy. I've seen him around. What's he look like?|His face? I don't know.|It's a face. I never really noticed. Are those the cops|Dumars put downstairs? Yeah. Is he still on the|couch with mom? - Yep. Are you okay? You know,|I haven't smoked in two days. You're a good influence on me. What the hell is he doing? Who? Garbageman. There's something glowing|in his apartment. Weird. Can I see? You're wearing perfume. Yeah. Oh, God!|I didn't even think! - It's okay.|- I'm so sorry. He might be allergic to you. - Shut up, Rosy.|- Shut up, Rosy. - I'm gonna go.|- I'm coming. - I'm sorry.|- I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. Come in. You're alone. Yeah, Rosy's arguing|with your mom and Dumars. - Guess what.|- What? I've given up everything. No cigarettes.|No perfume. I'm clean, harmless. You could eat off me. God, what a corncob. What's Dumars doing now? Trying to pork mom,|accusing me of being a junkie. I want to smash him. How's Garbage? He doesn't leave|his apartment anymore. Just watches. Sounds familiar. Des has been gone long enough|to be a missing person. Did you ask Officer Dumars? Whatever. He's got other things|on his mind. Can I look? Sure. Are you okay? Are you taking anything? I haven't had anything|since Des has been gone. It's part of the problem. There's Mrs. Leibowitz. Ma Bell? Yeah, she's been down there|for a while. I think she's looking|for Desmond. Like Rosy?|Lost a fix. Fuck off, Carmen. Or get on|with fucking my brother, so I can stop chaperoning|you over here. Rosy... I'm sorry. It's just... I don't know what we saw,|but it looked bad. And Garbageman... I gotta do something. You know, my dad's|the building manager. Bad idea. What idea? It would be the easiest thing|to get a key to Garbageman's apartment. Terrible, terrible idea. And Marvin|could keep watch for us. Here's my mobile number. Haven't you guys seen|this movie? Fucking terrible idea. What do you think? The Pastures. Adam Pasture. The kid who disappeared|last week. His family would have|reported him missing. We could talk to them.|See what they know. And it might help get|Dumars to take us serious-ly. Come on, it's not gonna hurt. Yeah? - It's Carmen. There's|no answer at the Pastures place. I can't see|through the curtains. What's Garbageman doing? I can't tell.|His apartment's dark. - Maybe he's gone.|- I don't know. He's been hanging out|in the dark lately. - Jesus.|- What? Garbageman.|He's in Birdman's apartment. - You sure?|- He's just standing there. Then he's not home. Carmen? - Carmen?|- Hey, Marvin, we're inside. - Carmen, there's two of them.|- God, it smells like shit in here. Two of who? - Two Garbagemen.|- What? Maybe neither of them are him.|You need to get out of there. Now, just a sec.|Rosy found feathers. They're gray,|like pigeons or something. I don't think it's him. Of course, I just figured out|what was glowing. It's his fridge.|It's padlocked though. Carmen, get Rosy.|Get out of there. She's trying to find|a light switch. Carmen, can you hear me? Yes, dear, I can hear you. I know you think|this is a bad idea, but... Rosy, no! Carmen, get out! Fuck. Mom. Mom! Mom!|Rosy's in trouble! Mom! It's serious! God dammit! Dammit, Marvin,|you are way too old for this! Please, just go over there! I just don't understand.|Rosy was... Rosy was in Garbageman's apartment|and then he took her! - What do you mean that he took her?|- Haven't we bugged this guy enough? Rosy could be dead right now! - I'm calling the cops.|- I am the cops! I mean the real cops. Rosy. - She says she lives here.|- Yeah, we're her parents. Then I'd appreciate it|if you kept an eye on her. Are you okay? What happened, exactly? She was in my apartment. I don't think|she stole anything. What were you doing in there?|Are you stealing? Is this about drugs? - No.|- This won't happen again. You are not leaving|till you are cleaned up. Who do you think you are? Oh, Rosy! Now, you are grounded.|Get in your room. - Fuck off.|- Get... Rosy. - I'm sorry.|- I'll file a police report if you want. No. Thank you. Thank you.|We won't bother you again. I appreciate that. - Good night.|- Night. Why didn't he recognize you? I thought you had a talk|with him. Why do you insist on doing this|to your mother? You're too old to ground. He couldn't go anywhere anyway. Okay. I'll see you in a sec. Thanks. How you doing? Good. Carmen's place is great. You think you'll stay long? I don't know. Do you think Dumars|has any terminal diseases? Yeah, okay, babe. Sure, I'll talk to you soon. Yeah. Talk to you soon. Bye. Marvin. You're in my room. Well, that was your mom.|She'll be home soon. She's... - Leave it.|- Sorry. I said leave it! So, Marvin... I want us... I want us to be friends. So what exactly is your beef? I just don't know|what you're doing. Well... Well, your mom... She's a special lady. And she really digs me. And I think that what we've got|could really blossom. I don't want to know|what you do with my mom, just so long as you never|pretend to be my dad. And stop pretending|that you don't believe me and assigning these guys|to the courtyard. What? And who's the official-|looking guy in the car? Let me see. And there's another one. And another one. Those aren't my guys. I might as well be a beat cop. I don't even have "guys". I'm... I'm sorry. I was trying|to impress your mom. I don't even have the authority|to put men on patrol. Well, then who are they? Well... maybe I could find out. Hey, you're home.|What are you doing out here? Oh, trying not to smoke. Because of Marvin?|That's so sweet. Shit, it's Garbageman. What the hell is this? This was supposed|to happen tomorrow. I'm out of time. It's now or never. Is it stable? If you keep it cold. I don't like it. Watch it! I'm very, very sorry. It was a mistake. A little mistake. I'm very sorry. Excuse me, sir? Sir? Just a moment. The phone. Where's the fucking phone? - Marvin?|- Where are you? Downstairs, following Garbageman.|We need your eyes. We need help. Close it. Now. The customer you are|trying to reach is out... Oh, my God. Well... fuck. What's going on? You're about to get|what you paid for. Rosy... Fuck! Oh, my God! No! No! Let me help. She won't stop bleeding. Good. The blood draws them. No! No! Oh, my God! No! Let her out! Hush.|You're gonna help me. Come on, come on. Come on. - 911 emergency.|- I need help. The Judas breed.|I've seen two of them. Could you repeat that, sir? Two people are dead.|A cop is dead. My sister's been... killed. Come on. Go. Give me the goddamn phone. - The Judas egg.|- Smart boy. That's a king egg.|That's a fertile male. Yeah.|I have an emergency. Forward this to the CDC,|A.D. Kirschner. Immediately. Authorization 197667. We've got two specimens. They're soldier caste.|Probably more. What's the matter? I'm allergic to roaches. Right. Then you'll be|my coal miner's canary. Put that in the fridge. Nobody does anything stupid,|and nobody has to die early. We have to destroy it. Now, that qualifies as stupid. A fertile male|could establish a new colony. A new outbreak. Deck chairs on the "Titanic".|That egg is one of thousands underground. They're hoarding them.|Waiting. We have to destroy it.|We have to try to... I will kill you.|So help me God, I'll kill you. Here. That egg equals|my getaway money. As far from civilization|as I can get. We've already lost. It's over. - Empty that around the door.|- It's kerosene. They don't like fire. That doesn't make any sense.|They don't have intelligence. Strategize, reason. They adapt.|That's how we made them. They don't have to be|any bigger or stronger, so they got smarter. This is not a city anymore. It's a goddamn killing jar. The door! - Mom.|- Yeah? Why aren't you in your room? Run! - Close the goddamn door!|- Oh, my God. Don't shoot. It's us. Marvin... Is Carmen alive? He's trying to talk.
