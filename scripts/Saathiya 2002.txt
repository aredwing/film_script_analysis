Is this a Ramlila? Hey, you. Stop. - Sir, I've got to go to the station. Do I have to write it down for you? Can't you hear? Sorry sir, Sorry. - You can't go from here. There has been an accident. Take a U-turn and go back. Go... Today 6.30 p. M Marine Lines Station What are you doing here? Waiting for Suhani? Like always. If you'd married me, you wouldn't have had to do all this. If she doesn't come in the next ten minutes... We'll run away to a temple and get married. Let's go. Is Suhani there? Did she say where she was going? Are you sure she is not somewhere there... in the hospital? Okay, I'll disconnect the phone. "It overflowed... the water from the pitcher overflowed" "It overflowed, for the eye could not hold" "Mother said, don't go. Brother, I didn't listen to him" "Father said, just one day more. And it overflowed" "Gudda said don't go. Guddi too said the same" "Friend said, just one day more. And it overflowed..." "The water from the pitcher overflowed" "It overflowed, for the eyes couldn't hold" There goes one more. Another one bites the dust. He used to be quite a happy guy. Now he's gone and stuck his head in a noose. Why? What's wrong with our girl? - Your girl? So big? How old are you? It's the magic of LUX beauty soap! What else? Are you done speaking? - Yes. What was it you were saying about putting his head in a noose? When it comes to wearing the garland... Why'd you all stick your heads out like tortoises? It's just that this tortoise did not know that you live in this village. I am very pleased to meet you. What's your name? Ruin. What's the matter Adi? - I thought marriage was ruin. Ok. So what if it's not you. There are other men who will willingly die for me. Hey, you mirchi (chili) Here's a bitter gourd. Eat it. You and your disciples. Adi, what's she saying & going away? Don't put your lips to it. She's quite bitter. "As she walked, she said your house was small" "I left my songs behind. Under the wings of a bird" By the way, who is this girl who just gave this shagun? Why? Do you also want the shagun? - No... no. She talks a lot. Quite a wily girl. Listen Mister, she's my daughter. Daughter! No, I meant she is very gifted. Faux paus... I'm dead meat. By the way... what is her name? Boy, if you weren't a guest I would have made mincemeat out of you. Get lost... mannerless. "And the water from the pitcher overflowed" "It overflowed, for the eyes couldn't hold" "Mother said don't go. Brother said I didn't listen" "Father said just one day more. And the water overflowed" "The crow said don't go. So did the saint..." "The crow said, just one day more. And it overflowed" Oh Ruin, I was looking for you. Even my father is looking for you. - Oh God... Escape! You have a great smile. I had heard that village girls are very simple and innocent. Shy! Excuse me aunty! Here, she is both simple and shy. Great son! - Greetings. "Father... I left your courtyard" "Your courtyard... I left it behind" "When I come home next time, bring a diamond ring" "My friends will play with it on their laps..." "A bouncing bonny baby" "When the monsoons come this time" "Another kind of separation will have its say..." "Separation from my beloved" RAILWAY COLONY, MUMBAI. Close the book and open your mouth and eat. This way nothing will go in either your mouth or your brain. Oh mom, if I fail, you'll haul me over burning coals. No. I'll eat you raw. The things your father has to endure for your studies. Please quit fighting. - What else should I do? Now, why are you not eating? The paratha is so oily and the yogurt is so sour. Then, how come Dina ate it? Oh God! Dina! Dina! Dina! She's the only one you like. The rest are all second rate. Now, will you two stop it? Mom, she has an exam today. What should I do with this girl? Hey, where're you going? You carry your anger on the tip of your tongue. Once you become a doctor, your patients will die without a hiccup. If something happens to me, don't ever take me to her. This girl is a real burden. So why don't you give me away to him? To whom? He who believes that a girl is a burden. Do your exam well. Dad! Good I met you. Now my paper will go off well. Your blessings are very important for doing well. Go via the temple. Here, keep some money. Dad, she sends others to the temple for her. You are so pretty. One kiss on this cheek. Your beard is hurting. My beard hurts... let it. Some things also hurt me... Hurt me a lot. Hi uncle. - Hi Pinks. And rub yourself clean. The smoke must have clogged your pores. Do you know what your son did yesterday? - Why, is he not your son? I saw him on a motorcycle... with a long haired woman. Both of them were in flames. Even smoke was coming out of their mouths. Dad! Why are you beating about the bush? Get to the point. Mom, Dad saw me smoking a cigarette yesterday. Cigarette! They were smoking a cigar. A Peace pipe. He would take a drag and pass it to her... She would take a drag and pass it back. What a good for nothing. Son, I've. Who was she? - Like a brother. Adding glitter to the Gold. She is just like a boy. She must have been Meera, mom. Even you scolded her for talking like boys. And if I smoked one cigarette, what great sin have I committed? You have done a great deed. "It overflowed... the water from the pitcher overflowed". "It overflowed for the eye couldn't hold". You don't know anything about her... And you want us to find one girl in a population of 12 million. What's the population of Bombay? - 12 million. How many of them will be women? - 50% Out of these 6 million, how many would be college going? Hardly 10% - No no, less than that. Let's assume 10% So how many is that? - 600,000. Out of these 600,000, how many would be medical students? So, she is a doctor. Lets say 1% How many? How many? - Your maths is very weak. Out of this 6000, how many would travel in a local train? Only in the city of Bombay? Most would travel by car. Leaving out buses, taxis and autos, at least 1% will use local trains. So, how many does that leave us with? - Barely 60. So, out of 60 medical students. Is it so difficult... to search for Come quickly. "Life is a pleasant journey" She is looking at you. "What happens tomorrow, no one knows..." "Sing and dance through your life... don't bother what the world has to say" Don't bother. Correct. I think you are in love. There is no such perversity in my mind. - What do you mean? I mean I have not lost my bearings. All that is for the unoccupied. Mister, this is not love. This is lust. It's also called desire or hunger. Now repeat what I said. Shut up Mr. Psychic. Look son, after seeing this girl's body once... you've lost your balance. After seeing her gait... you've forgotten where you are going, Do you call this love? So what do we call it? - As a famous poet once said: "What we call love is nothing but a perversity of the mind" What do you mean perversity? In medical terms... It means that your hormones are working overtime. Shut up. In Hindi, that means keep your nonsense to yourself. Your face is saying it all. - What? That I've lost my bearing!? It looks like there is a fire in you. - Shut up. "This life is a pleasant journey..." Shut up Dina, let me sleep. He's not here. Get off the train. Why don't you look on top. Maybe he's dancing on the roof. Very funny! By the time you see him, the train would have started. Look there. Over there... your lover boy. Aren't you going to get off? Hello! Hi! Who are you looking for? - Nobody. That girl there? Whose taking off her... Taking the clothes off the line? Do you know her name? Do you know how to whistle? ...Like this? Good. You look like a decent man. Make some noise... What? - Accelerate your bike. Dina See. It worked. What are you doing there? Coming, I was just showing him the way. Poor thing, didn't know where to go. Dina, are you coming up or not? This life is a pleasant journey. Where? - Who? Why are you singing this song now? Life is a pleasant journey. Miss. Suhani, I miss you very much. Morning, noon and night... your face haunts me. Either stop haunting me or tell me what we both should do. Miss. Suhani, I miss you very much. Morning, noon and night... your face haunts me. Shut up Dina. He's mad. He's even landed here. - He's the same chap, isn't he? Yes. The madman has come here also. Excuse me. Yes, I'll give her moral support. Where are you going? - Body Guard. No, you come here. Come with me. What's your name? Aditya. Are you after girls leaving your studies behind? Looks like your father has a lot of money to waste. Yeah. That's just, what he says too. How many times have you failed in your class? I haven't so far. But may be this time it'll happen. "Dear friend..." "Your soft, lilting laughter" "I heard it and drank it all up" "May you always laugh like this, and blush shyly" "And light and darkness meet on the nape of your neck, under your curls..." "May your fragrant laughter grow and envelop me..." "Don't go in the garden dressed in yellow sunshine" "The bees will tease you, so don't go among the flowers" "Laugh softly again... your beautiful laughter..." "Lying on the lawn, like freshly fallen leaves" "There are seven hues in one sensuous move of Spring" "The rainy season... it's all you" "Laugh season to season... that soft laughter of yours" "Dear friend..." "Your soft lilting laugh" "I heard it, and drank it all up" "Come, let's roam around in the blue skies sometime..." "If we find a speck of cloud by chance, let's shower it on earth" "Your ear-ring is quivering... somewhere morning has broken" "Somewhere evening has fallen" "In the shelter of your hair, we will spend the night" "Your jet-black eyes hold a glint in them" "In exchange for a smile from you take this earth of mine..." "And this sky too" "Oh dear friend..." "Your soft, lilting laughter... dear, dear friend..." "I heard it, and drank it all up" "Snow has fallen in the valley..." "Cuddled in white woolen" "Snow has fallen in the valley, and your laughter hummed through it" "Cuddled in wool..." "Talk and words come out as vapor" "Hot, steaming vapor... yet soft and gentle" Who's speaking? Tell him: Call Suhani from no. 105 Call Suhani from No. 105. Who's that? - This is Pinky. Pinky? - He asks Pinky, who? Tell him her friend's sister. Tell him her friend's sister. What work do you have with her? Uncle wants to talk to her. Brat. Say what I say. - Brat, say what I say. You shouldn't talk like that. Say, go and tell Suhani... that there is a call for her. Why are you abusing the kid? I am not abusing her, madam. He is my nephew. Give me the phone. Uncle, my ten rupees. You promised me. Here. Now, run away. Hi Jeevan Uncle, whose phone is it? - It's some friend's, uncle. Suhani? - You! Where did you get my number from? Listen, I have something to tell you. - What? Tomorrow there is a function at our house. Be here sharp at 9 am. Me? Why me? Why? Because you sing very well. - So what? Look, I am not asking you to come with me to Khandala, am I? I'm only asking you to come for our family function. But, why should I come to your house? Because if you don't come to my house, I will bring everyone to your house. You are mad. You've totally lost it. I am mad for you. At least write down the address of my mad house. At least listen to me. OK, do you know Worli dairy? Take a 'u-turn' from there... Close to it is a garden, our house is just next to that. Adi? Who's this Adi in our house? "Looking into my eyes..." "meeting my gaze..." "Looking into my eyes, betrayal and deceit he gave me..." "He held me captive in his eyes" "I lost all sense of myself. I was in a trance..." "He sure had cast a spell on me..." "with a mere touch" "Deceit and betrayal is what I saw him overflowing with..." "When he looked into my eyes..." "when he looked into my eyes" "He held me captive in his eyes" Who are those girls? She's the one I am going to marry. Which one? That one in the cream sari. Adi, are you really going to marry that girl? Absolutely aunty. So far we haven't fixed a date... But, once it's fixed. You will be the first to know. Adi's marriage has been finalized. Adi's engagement has been fixed. She's Adi's fiance. Congratulations. - Congratulations. You didn't tell us Aditya's marriage has been fixed. Who's, what has been fixed? - Adi's... Marriage. Really. With whom? - With that girl. The one in the cream sari. Congratulations to you also. She won't ask for any dowry, I hope... You are very amusing. Yes. Who's that? I don't know. - What do you mean? Why did you say that I am going to marry you? When did I say that you are marrying me? I only said that I am marrying you. Did you ask me? How can I? That is the work of the elders in a family. But if you are insisting, why don't I ask you? Will you...? - Very Good. Then tomorrow morning, I'll send mom and dad over to your place... Everything can be finalized there. Why would I want to marry you? No no no. You should ask, why would I want to marry you? Why? Because... What? Should I...? What is that? What do you mean? - Yes What do you mean... - What do you mean...? I love you... it means I can do anything for you. Can you jump from the train for me? Sure. As soon as it stops, I'll jump off. And as soon as you jump, I'll marry. It's simple. Do you like him or not? My final exams are approaching, and then I have to intern. And I have to prepare for my M.D., as well. I don't know. But answer me. Do you like him or not? How can I? Before me, you have to get married... we'll see after that. Give me a straight, yes or no. - No. Alright, then, My way is clear. Don't blame me later. What do you mean? Meaning, you don't like him but I like him a lot. What do you mean by that? - Simple. L-like-him-a-lot. So, you want to have your cake and eat it too. Dad, if there is a proposal from a rich family, what would you do? What? - What are you muttering? I am just asking. If there is a proposal then... What sort of a proposal? - Obviously a marriage proposal. Now, someone isn't gong to come and get a rakhi tied from you. If she is saying something, let her finish it. Dina, stop throwing the trump card. I got a jack, so I am throwing a jack. Excuse me. I have to study. It's your turn. - Yes. A family is going to come with a marriage proposal... Not for me, for Suhani. - All right, but who is it? A barrister... his son is Aditya. No one has sent any word. They won't just land up just like that? That's what I am doing. Informing you. Is this why we pawned our jewellery and sent you to college? Did we sent you to college for this? Mom, I haven't done anything. Neither am I marrying... nor have I asked anyone to come with a proposal. If someone wants to pile on, what can I do? You must have done something. Otherwise no one piles on just like that. Please, come in. Barrister Om Sehgal. Your bell is probably not working. That's why, I had to use my hands. I did call the electrician, but he hasn't shown up. How do you do? - How do you do? Please, come this way... I hope you didn't have a problem finding the house? It was a bit of problem. All these houses look so alike... Like compartments of a train. After all, it is a railway colony. He loves to joke. All middle class houses look alike. Maybe you have never seen them... Come Suhani. Sir, these are my daughters. Dina and Suhani. Come in... Sit. Both of them sing very beautifully. I've heard them when they came home. Really? They've been brewing their own broth quietly. Times and customs are changing. Parents today are just figureheads... to endorse the wishes of their children. These children do as they please, we no longer have a say in anything. Now, I told Aditya that I agree that it's my money... But the lungs are yours, but where will he quit smoking? By the way, between these two which one is the one Aditya wants... He is very forgetful by nature. If I happen to overstay... at my parent's house. He'll ask me at the door "Who are you?" "Whom do you wish to see?" Quite an entertaining man. He must keep everyone occupied at home. Why don't you get some tea for everyone? Suhani is the younger one. She and Adi are in love with each other. And the elder? - Dina is the elder one. She isn't married yet. - Why? Is she waiting for someone who won't ask for dowry? You are quite rude, Sir, What do you think my daughters are? We might be poor, but we've brought them up like princesses. Please don't misunderstand me. I was saying it's good... That the girl's parents don't have to worry about dowry now. Anyway we don't expect anything... from you. No, if you have any expectations, do tell us. What expectations can we have from you? We don't have any from our own son. We've given him good education... that's enough. He's an adult now. If he even picks up someone from the street... We cannot do anything about it. One minute. Do you think we are auctioning our daughters on the roadside... For the first available groom? Dad, what are you saying? - You keep quiet. Mr. Advocate here can argue with a magistrate... But he does not know the courtesies to talk to his in-laws to be. You are unnecessarily twisting the issue. I did not mean that at all. - There is nothing more to be said. We do not want to marry our daughter in your family. What has happened hasn't happened with either your consent or mine. Let it be, this is no time for sweets, let's go. I'm glad we're under no obligations. Suhani... Listen... What happened? What had to happen has happened. Let's finish this right here. Dad went to meet your father. What happened? Yes, they met. Like Musharraf met Vajpayee. It was like reliving the Agra summit. - This marriage is not between... A Prime Minister and a President for the decision to be taken in Parliament. We have to marry. It's for us to decide. What will we decide? By seeking their permission... we showed them our respect. The respect we got... from your father is more than enough. We don't want anymore. So, my love for you comes to nothing? How long have you known me? They have nurtured me for 20 years. I cannot leave them for you. Suhani, I can leave everything for you. Everything. Today, you can leave everything for me... What is the guarantee that tomorrow you will not leave me for another girl? What is this inverted logic? In the end... why do I have to be the scapegoat? Why are you making a mountain... out of a molehill? You saw me, chased me, professed your love... That's all. What if I had refused you right in the beginning? Then, I would have called it your bad luck. So, do that now. Ok... ok... you were right and I was wrong. At least listen to me, Suhani. Please. Just one minute. See, what is the hurry to decide? Give it some time. till the 15th. Think about it. If you still think that... How will one week change anything? Just leave it. Give it some time. Anything can happen. Please. I might fall in love with someone else. You love me, don't you? Today 9.50 p. M Marine Lines Station Going fine, sir. How is Dr. Suhani? We never get time to talk to her. Before it's 5.30, she has already left the hospital. Is it? This evening, I told her to wait for me. I had some work. I got delayed by 10 minutes and she was nowhere to be found. Sir, I'll talk to you later. What happened? - He doesn't know. She left the hospital at 5.30. Call Rajee. She must have gone there. She's just had a baby. Hi Adi... long time no see. You and Suhani don't come over often? In a day or two. And listen... - Ok, bye. Aditya, this relationship is not possible. Lives don't change in 8 or 10 days. And I heard that lives change in a flash. Mine didn't. You didn't miss me at all? No, there was no reason to. And there is so much to do. Household chores. Studies. You want to think again? - I've thought already. Always stay like this. How? Weeping? Laughing. How long will you evade it? ...I mean, the train? How long will you avoid train? I might even forget, only if you let me. Take it easy. It's a computer... not your grandfather's typewriter. Like Billu, even we'll have our days... - Who's Billu? Good old Bill Gates, who else? You should come quickly to take your calls, especially at night. Uncle, your phone. What are you doing? What's the matter? Has it got disconnected? Then, why don't you talk? I am not listening. Who are you looking for? - Do you know where Suhani is? Hadn't you both broken up? Broken up... yet... Do you know where she is? I've been looking for her for many days. - She's gone. Gone? - She's gone to the US. US? - No, she has gone on a Medical camp. When is she returning? - In 3 weeks. Three weeks is too long, isn't it? What will you do with 2,000 rupees? I am going out. Where? Outside Bombay? Yes... I'll be back soon. What if your father finds out...? Please handle him. Are you going with Suhani? To find her. "The sky was barren" "When I went in search of you, my dear beloved" "I walked many miserable miles. "It's all such a waste" "It's all a wasteland, so futile..." "Let me meet my darling... Let me meet, just once" "O my dearest one, I scanned the skies minutely..." "and plucked the broken stars" "This starlight till the dawn, my eyes get no sleep" "Just to hear your footfall..." "I have even borne the silence of the stones and the statues" "I now find only dejection" "Look at the fate that is etched on my brow" "Whenever I saw footprints, I've bowed my head there" "How many times must I call out to you?" "Your name is what I find everywhere" Why did you take so long to come? I can't live without you... not a single day. Not a moment. Can you do anything for me? Should I jump off a moving train? Marry me. We'll marry and stay in our own homes. We won't tell anyone yet. Not a soul? - No. When the time is right, we'll disclose it. What happened? What are you thinking? I am very scared. Never mind. Then, get married in a state of scare. Don't be silly. I am really scared. I'll give you one slap and it will be alright. I warned you 10 times. Think before you say yes. And every time you told me to shut up. I'm in a dilemma. I've thought about this very seriously. If I felt it was wrong I would never let you do it. Now come on or you'll miss the bus. Come on. How come you're wearing a sari today? Isn't she looking pretty? Of course. But she suddenly looks like, it's time for her to get married. Why don't I get her married, then? Let's hurry up. We're sure to miss the bus... We'll go by an auto. Where are my princesses going dressed like this? We are getting late. - I am glad I met you... God bless you. I'm late today. Adi... which way are you going? Why don't you carry on...? Aren't you very late today? Yes, we were discussing the Gazdar case. Where are you going in such a hurry? Close by... to meet a friend. Get in, I'll drop you. - No, it's OK. Get in, you'll waste money on a taxi otherwise. Sit down. You haven't informed their parents, have you? No, just a few college friends. Very good. I am tired of marrying couples in the court. We're crossing the court, let's cross it fast. And Mr. Aditya, what's cooking nowadays? Nothing at all, dad. I am aware of everything that is happening. What? You haven't completed your law studies, And you've started a computer business. Oh, that! - What oh...? Where will you get the capital from? The Bank is ready to give a loan. - Really? Only, if you sign the guarantee... - Of course. It's your right. We have a debt to repay to you. Isn't it our duty? Where is the groom? This is going to be interesting. Aditya, what are you doing in a temple? So, this is a temple? - You don't believe in God. So, what are you doing here? You must have a reason. What can I do, aunty? You have to come here to get married. Oh shut up! Anyway, God will do his justice. Does he do his justice in English or in Hindi? "O beloved..." "Listen, my darling. Listen my dearest" "The moon will stealthily enter through the window, barefoot" "Listen, my beloved. Listen my love" Now, the fun starts. My wife has gone and all I am left with is a receipt for our marriage. Have patience for a few days. How many days? ...4... 5... 6...? First, let Dina get married at least. - Then, ask her to get married. Why don't we get her married next week itself? First, let me finish my internship and in the meanwhile... You must establish your business. - You are being so cold. Do you know today is our nuptial night? Can we meet somewhere? Right now, I am at Jeevan uncle's stores... Asking the rates for food grains. - You are so unromantic. So unromantic! What good night? All alone... It's a lonely night. Remove your hand. People are watching. - So what? You are my legal wife. Here's the certificate. Why are you carrying this around? - What can I do? This is the only substitute I have. Why are you going on and on with wife? Wife...? Take off your hand. Is she your wife? - No, she is my life. Sit properly. This is a public bus. Are you married? - Yes, since 15 years. I pity your husband. Nothing...d Suhani, there is a call for you. What is it? I told you I love you. - I know. Then, you should also know that we both have the same address. Yet, we are both so far. Tell me, you love me. Tell the doctor to check his patients. I say, hang up... Sir, it's an emergency case. We'll have to keep him in intensive care. He sounds a little mad. She didn't say it? - Run. Sorry. You had to wait for 2 hours. To catch a glimpse of you, I can wait for two lifetimes. I've got to go. - No. People are coming to see Dina. - No. "Come everyday to me turn the night into a day" "On the sly, under the sheet of the night" "Where even the moon can't approach" "Let's go behind a cloud" "Where every drop pines... every drop is in turmoil" "Where time stops still" "Give us a hug under the sheet of the night" "In the warmth of the winter's sunshine" "Look at me with lowered eyes..."

Behind a cloud" Dina, unlike me, is not so quiet. She talks a lot. She knows a lot. Don't go by what she says. Dina is very simple... very tolerant. She has taken the responsibility of the entire household and... ...she never complains. Isn't it? In fact, it's the same case with Raghu. See, he hasn't even opened his mouth so far. Raghu... say something. If you say yes... For us everything is alright... Why? - I am agreeable too. But, you should ask Dina as well. - Don't worry about that. We called you only when Dina said yes. When you give your consent... We'll get an auspicious date fixed. And you've told that you're not superstitious. Can I say something if you don't mind...? Your younger daughter and my younger son are both studying medicine. What's it called? Bio-Technology. - Yes, Bio-Technology. He's doing a Masters degree. We haven't asked Kartik, but... We'll ask him and you ask your daughter. If they agree then, its God's will. Both brothers and sisters... Can stay in the same house. What are you saying, mom? How can this be? If it can, what's wrong with it? It's like a yard sale. Buy one, get one free. We are not selling our daughters. They haven't even asked for a dowry. The boy is well educated. This is a stroke of good fortune. Why are you attaching my fortune with his? - Speak softly. Wear this. - What's wrong in what I am wearing? I won't do it. Mom, I cannot marry. It seems you're going to ruin Dina's fortune. Wear this. She got scared hearing about her marriage. Even, I'd gotten scared. If I had any inclination that something like this would happen, I surely wouldn't have come. But, that's how my father is. Are you OK with it? I am already married. My parents don't know. I married secretly in the court. Railway Colony, Mumbai. Is Suhani here? There is no one by that name here. Get lost. Where is Suhani? Where is Suhani? Where is Dina? - She's not at home. I am asking you to tell me where Suhani is. What's happened to her? I don't know. She left the hospital at 5. It's 11 now... there is no news of her. I've gone home twice. There is no news of her. So, where has she gone? You must have said something to her. - And 2 inches! Height 5 feet 2 inches. Wearing a light brown Sari. A doctor's coat, hand bag, stethoscope. Sir, there is a hospital ID card as well. Hospital ID-card. Yes, just check and call me. Uncle, are you going? - Yes. Leaving home and going away? - Yes. She's the one who should cry, whose marriage you have broken. I don't want to marry. Yes, why would you want to marry? She is the one in a hurry to get married. The elder one is still unmarried and the younger one has no patience. In six months she'll be abandoned and be on the streets. Get lost. There is no place for you in this house. Be sensitive, he's leaving the house. Whose house? When was this his house? This is my house. Aditya, don't go away. Anyone who is stopping him can leave with him as well. Get out. Let it be. Get out of my house. From this day, we will have no dealings with this house. Promise me. We'll never show our face to them again. We both are enough for each other. - OK. Take me to the temple. Why? Do you want to marry again? - Shut up and get in. Okay, let's go. We carry the burdens of the world on our heads. What are you doing? Be careful. - Thank you. At least you noticed. The stove is a gift from me. Buy yourself your own gas. I can gift you a matchbox. What is all this? - It belongs to my brother. Does he drink here? All this will get shifted inside. He'll drink in his section. This part of the house belongs to you. Hey kids! There is a great advantage in eloping with a girl. The girl doesn't threaten to go back to her parents every now and then. That is true. She won't threaten. Yes, but there is also a problem. - What's that? Eloping with girls... will become a habit and... He'll keep running away with all and sundry. Did you weigh your profits and losses when you eloped with aunty? No, no. It was she who made me run away. Really? How did that happen? I'd had a bit too much to drink. I got emotional. Let's go. - There is some left... What's the matter. You seem to be very happy. Excited? "Soaring..." "Are my dreams" "my heart dreams... of colourful nights" "The light mist that descended last night..." "left my eyes brimming..." "as it pattered on my hands" "The joy of getting drenched in the first rains of the season" "I was drenched in the first rains, without a regret..." "all over town, without a regret" "Like her plaits in knots, coming free..." "it poured all night" "At times, coaxing. At times, tormenting..." "like the moods of my beloved" "When I tease her out of love, sometimes... she sulks" "Even when I let go in a fit of anger, "I have a battle on my hands" "Even if I simply kiss her, I still have a battle to cope with" "The light of my eyes means the life to me..." "in my eyes I preserve this life, it's only for you..." "Few are the moments of life to spend them in disagreement" "I have been through death to put our fragile hearts together" "Ask for anything and I can present it to you" "But, do consider... there are very few stars in the sky anyway" "The light of my eyes means the life to me..." "even though my eyes have often seen a sweet bitterness..." "this life, this life of mine..." "without a regret..." "all over town, without regret, only for you" "Like her plaits in knots, coming free..." "it poured all night" "Coaxing, tormenting... like the moods of my beloved" "Soaring..." "are my dreams" "my heart dreams... of colourful nights" Don't see through your right eye. It's inauspicious. Where is the newspaper? I have been waiting for 15 minutes. Hoping that when you get up... you will see me first. And all you want is the paper. OK, I've seen you. Now, where is the paper? At night you were making many promises. What happened now? Really? What was I saying? - Liar. You aren't worried about your wife But, you want to know... what's happening in Patna. Please give me the paper. - You won't get it. You can't get your wife and the news together. Suhani, where's the paper? But, what's happened in Patna? - Riots have broken out. Where is the paper? Here's your hot news. - What madness is this? Hey kids! What's going on? - Nothing. Why are you burning the house? All this won't do in someone else's house. But, this is my house... - How's it your own house...? That will happen when you pay the rent. What did you tell Pushy? That you'd pay 5 months rent in advance. Where is it? I said on the 1st... - The 1st went by long ago. What's the date today? No, I meant the 1st of next month. - Uncle, the tea is getting cold. Do you want to mix it? In front of this girl, I cannot argue. Poor thing has left her parents house. - And poor me. Even I have left my parents house. - Left the house...? You must have been thrown out. - Uncle, have your tea. Meera, what happened to that Sintel file? Bhaskar is working on some more details. Are you people following it up properly or not? Of course we are. But, there has been no response from their side. But, what is the problem? Until their American Co-coordinators don't approve the project... The deal cannot progress. - Show me the file. No. Wrong number. Some Anil Mehta. I had gone to buy vegetables. I've been waiting for you for an hour. - Sorry. If you were going to take that long, you should've left the keys with someone. With whom? Pushy Aunty? And what if she'd asked for the rent? So, should I just keep sitting... until her Excellency arrives? Do you think I went for a stroll? I had gone to shop for our dinner. But, what's the idea of making me sit like a guard? Why are you splitting hairs? Before marriage... you could wait for me for hours at the station. Did you become a ticket checker because of that? Come on. It was another thing then. - What? How was it different then? Open the door. We weren't married then... that's why. - No... yes... And now we are married. So, you don't care for me any longer? When did I say that? - But, that's what you implied. Give me the key. Don't change the topic. Why don't you say it clearly... that you don't need me anymore. Now, why are you splitting hairs? Give me the keys. I won't give him any food. Once he sleeps hungry, he'll realize. And remember this incident. - And even you remember this... - What? Every time you fight with me, I'll keep on making up with you like this. Let go of me. Leave me. Not right now. Get lost. That's what you said before marriage also. Exactly. Because unlike you, I've not changed after marriage. Now, what is this? The days that you fight with me. I will mark the calendar. - Why? To prove that getting married is very risky business. That is true. Considering the way you fight with me at night... And bite and claw me... Should I show you the marks? Do you want to see them? The mood is pleasant... What's it? Are you trying to find me? I am here. Where is my mangalsutra? Forget it, I am alive right here and ready to be hugged. You took it out at night saying it pricks. I am the symbol of your marriage. Why don't you hug me? You prick even more. Where is my mangalsutra? Aunty... she'll ask for the rent. Leave me, you shameless! How was it last night? - What? Dhansak. Did you not eat it? - Oh that! That was great. She cleaned up all of it. Now, you don't even need to clean the utensils. Why don't you go and take the recipe from Aunty this evening? What is this mangalsutra doing here? Suhani, this should not be taken off. - Yes. I have been searching for this all morning. It has to be your doing. You must have hidden it. Why should I hide it? I thought I should wear it. Sometimes even the man should look married. How much sugar? - One spoon. Here comes our friend. Wait and see. He's going to start a fight. Wait for a minute. How are you? - Fine. Hello wife... how are you? Having tea? - I'm fine. I'll just be back. As long as you don't start it. Suhani, where is my project report file? Are you listening to me? Where is my file? I've told you so many times... not to move my things around. Why are you laughing...? Please stop it. Don't inject him anymore. - Suhani, take her out. Please come with me... come. - No, I won't go. Come with me... Let the doctor try at least. He's here for the past 2 days... Nothing has been done. Suhani, what's there to eat? I am very hungry. What happened? - Let me stay like this. Everyone is looking. - Let them. What's embarrassing? I am your wife. Are you embarrassed... Be reasonable, let's go inside. - Let your reasons be. Can you not even ask me what I've been through? OK, I am sorry. I didn't know what happened at the hospital, I just thought... Don't touch me. - Are you an untouchable? You could always sense my mood on the phone. Why are you so restless? You always knew the minute you saw me. You used to call me twice a day just to know how I was feeling. Don't you remember? - I remember. In spite of living in the same city and having a phone... You used to send me telegrams to cheer me up. Where did all those things got vanished? I am still ready to do all that. But, when will you grow up? We aren't college students anymore. We are responsible for each other. Do people stop loving after marriage? Don't stare like that. Did you even think of us or try to find out if we are dead or alive? Don't speak rudely, mother. Not one day has passed... when I've not missed you. You could have come home also. How could I have? Don't you remember what you and dad said when you threw me out. Your father's tyranny will be the end of us all. Lying in the hospital... - What's happened to dad? I am not the doctor. We've got a lot of tests done, but... These tests are for jaundice. Mom, I want to see dad. If you come, he will be pleased. We have come to call you. But, don't tell him that we met. Adi, Suhani is here. Hi. What happened? How come you didn't go to work? Dad is in hospital... can we go and meet him? It was you who said that we will not keep any links with anyone. Now, what happened? - Yes, but he is serious. He's in the Railway Hospital. - Who told you? He's got jaundice. He cannot be treated there. But, who told you? - Mom and Dina. I met them in the train. They know where we live and where I work. But, they didn't think it necessary to tell me. It's not that. Why do you think like that? I still remember my promise. But you are forgetting yours. He spent his entire life's savings to make me a doctor. What good is my being a doctor if...a Dr. Suhani, if your education is compelling you, then you may go. Neither am I a doctor nor am I compelled in any way. Why are you being indifferent? Other than the two of you... I have no one. We are the only ones they have. Suhani, I have not forgotten his slap till today. If you want to go, you may. How's your father? How do I know?. Didn't you go? How could I? I had promised. Then, break the promise. Let's go tomorrow. What if he says something again? When I've been slapped by him, how does a little scolding matter? Let's go tomorrow. Behave yourself in front of dad. And... - I'm wearing this for your dad. Go fast - I am sorry. I am sorry. - Take her there quickly. What...? - Go home.? Don't touch him. Let his soul rest in peace. No child would've given so much pain to the parents. Now, take your husband and leave our house. Mother...s Daddy... All my hopes are now pinned on the Sintel project. If we lose that then, we'll have to close the shop. With all the overheads... Now, stop it please. How long will you keep crying? It's been so many days. What should I do if I feel like crying? Had I not insisted on marrying, all this would never have happened. It was I who had insisted on marrying secretly. I was also so impatient. If you are repenting it. Why don't you leave me? If I can live without my father, I can live without you. Leave me alone. What should I say? - Just read what is written. Come on try, please. What if I get caught? Don't worry. You just have to act a little. Anyway, that's all you do through out the day. I'll slap you... Hello! This is... - Like a woman... shyly. Dina Sharma. Do you remember me? Mr. Sharma's daughter... Dina? Yes, Miss Dina! What a surprise! How are you? I am fine. I wanted to meet you once. - Me? What for? At 4 o'clock near the Kala Ghoda parking lot... Tomorrow. Don't worry, I won't bite. Can you connect me to Dina Sharma? Miss Dina. Good morning, this is Raghunath Pandit. Maybe you didn't recognize me... I recognize you very well. What do you want from me? I wanted to meet you. Why? Was it not enough to insult my family? That's why... I mean... I want to remove all doubts. If you could meet me for 5 minutes... Please... only for 5 minutes. If you could meet me tomorrow at 4 P.M. Near the Kala Ghoda parking lot, I would be grateful. Isn't that Raghu? - It sure looks like him. We were totally ruined after that incident. Dad passed away soon after. But, why should it concern you... you... I am sorry for what has happened. But, it's unfair of you... to blame me for all of it. If that is your attitude... why did you want to meet me? Why did you call me here? Excuse me, but it was you who called me on the phone. Otherwise, why would I have come? The phone call was made by you. I didn't even... do you think I had lost it that I should have called you? What do you think I am? Looks like they are fighting. Here is your coconut water. I'm leaving. Did you not call me... at the factory? - Why should I? You called me at the Bank. I did speak to you and you did ask me meet you here. Maybe you are... Oh God! So this was your doing. What do you think you are? A matchmaker? Do you want to start a marriage bureau? Actually... Your marriage broke up because of us. So I felt that... It's OK. Your intentions were good. But, you didn't do well... especially with Dina. It's been 10 days since we spoke to each other. It's not unusual after marriage. Look at Raj. Come. We don't speak for months at end. All our exchanges are through servants. I am beginning to feel that Adi is tired of me. Don't be stupid. Everyone says that if Adi ever flirts... with another girl, He'll see you in her. Is that any less worrisome? How is it? Looks like someone is very thirsty. Why... The other day when I was giving you coconut water... You were glaring at me. Am I a matchmaker...? I should start a marriage bureau. I think after this success... I should start one. And when should we arrange for the wedding bells to toll? Raghu, will you come on a white horse? Or must I get a black train booked for you? The day after tomorrow, they are coming home. Then, you can book your black trains. What happened? I wish Dad were still alive. Have this coconut water and stop the water from your eyes. I have ordered food at home. - What do you mean...? Oh sorry! Those people didn't have a place to party... So, I called them here. - I don't want to party. Did you ask me? - I didn't check... but Anju asked and I said yes. Is Anju going to decide... what is going to happen in my house? You should ask me... So many people and so little common sense. An open door opens like this and not like this. She'll just be here.. You were very scared of your parents ...how did they agree? I had to smuggle her out... - You are quite brave. This is nothing. One day she took Bhaskar to meet her parents. You are quite an intelligent girl. How did you ever get stuck with this Bhaskar? The same way I got stuck with her. The minute I looked at her, my mind started to wander. You are a very discouraging friend. Get married first. Then, you'll have to find out the price of food grains. Yes from Jeevan stores. Suhani knows the rates quite well. Remember...? Men show their true colours after marriage. How's that? Before marriage they are piling on to you everywhere... And after marriage they are embarrassed to even hold you. Does that really happen? Yes. You are embarrassed at your doing... So the easy way out is a mangalsutra to wear around the neck. Before marriage every man is special. After marriage... he becomes just another husband. For me, Adi can never be ordinary. I should have married you. - What had to happen has happened. You are tired of me now. - What? What were you saying? Come on Suhani. You know I was joking. It didn't sound like a joke to me. I've become stale. Or have you started to like someone else? Stop this nonsense. You never spoke like this before marriage. I am now. Nothing has changed even now. If you like someone else you can go with her. Now, where should I find another destiny? You were destined for me. And now I have to break my head with you throughout my life. That's what you do best. First, you taunt then you cry. Do I trouble you so much? What is my fault? The fault is mine to have left my parents for you. Then, go back to them. "A history of atrocities..." "And yet, you claim authority" "You take us by the hand and hurt us" "Good Heavens, no!" "Good Heavens, no!" "This is not done" "A history of atrocities..." "And it's blown out of proportions" "The lies in the world now threaten my life" "They're the ones who inflict atrocities... "And they're the ones who complain" "Good Heavens, no!" "This is not done" "Friends..." "How am I to spend a lifetime misled by illusions?" "If only I could take away your illusions" "Take away this affliction of love too" "Let that be... or else how will you manage?" "Your attitude, your involvement shall lead us on" "Life's a boat sailing miles across the sea" "We'll have to drown in it, there's miles of sea ahead" "A history of atrocities..." "And the pot calling the kettle black" "The lies in the world now threaten my life" "They're the ones who inflict atrocities and they're the ones who complain" "Good Heavens, no!" "Good Heavens, no!" "This is not done" I've been trying to find you for so long. I searched everywhere for you. Why? Is there something very important? Yes, it's important... but now I am suddenly shy. You... Dina... I thought once things got a little confirmed then... You were hiding it from me. Of course not. I wanted to meet and tell you myself. That's why, I'd stopped Aditya from tell you anything. Aditya... he knows about two of you? He's the one who brought us together again. - Yes. Dina, I've got to meet Aditya. - Go and meet Aditya. I have to go to Raghu's house. - To meet your mother-in-law? We've got the 90 million project from Sintel software! Hey, what are you watching? Is this a Ramlila? Hey you! Stop there. Where are you going? Sir, I have to go to the station. Do I have to write it down for you? Can't you hear me? Sorry sir, Sorry. You can't go from here. There's been an accident. Take a U-turn and go back. - OK, sir, Go on. What are you doing? Waiting for Suhani? Like always. If you'd married me, you wouldn't have had to do all this. If she doesn't come in the next ten minutes... We'll run away to a temple and get married. Let's go. Is Suhani there? - She has left already. Did she say where she was going? Are you sure she is not somewhere in the hospital? YASHWANT RAO I.A.S. RESIDENCE What happened? Who was driving? You? What was the need to drive? You don't even have a license. Are you OK? Did anyone else get hurt? Did anyone?. Tell me. Who was it? - A girl. How badly did she get hurt? ...Tell me... Is she alive? I don't know. I got scared and ran away. Good. It's all right. Did anyone take her to the hospital? Where did the accident happen? Kennedy Bridge. You relax. I'll go and see what's happening. Don't go. - You go on inside. Has an accident case from Kennedy Bridge been reported today? Yes, a girl has been admitted. Is she your relative? - What? Yes! Inform Dr. Murthy and prepare the O.T. You come with me. Hurry up. Doctor Khan, come to the operation theatre. Quick. Is she the one? She is critical. She has been hurt on her head. Doctors can't operate on her until someone takes her responsibility. Give me the name. - Yashwant Rao. No, what's her name? - Savitri. Savitri. Savitri What? - Savitri Rao. How are you related to her? Husband. Oh Good. Come with me. Some papers have to be signed. Where are you coming from? From the North. Meaning? Are you coming from Kashmir? No sir. North Bombay Society, Juhu. And you... - He is also... - Shut up! What's your name? - Aditya. Where are you going? My wife left home in the morning and hasn't returned. Have you lodged an FIR? - Yes. Have you checked the hospitals? - What? A girl met with an accident a little distance from here. Hospital... Yes... Yes... I am speaking from the hospital. Because of the commotion I could not report it earlier... No, there is no need to cover it up. Let the law take its course. I wanted... What...? No, her relatives have not been found yet... Has an accident case of a girl been reported? When? - This evening...e What's the name? - Dr. Suhani. Suhani Sehgal. There is no one by this name. In an emergency case, they obviously won't know the name. Please check for a 22-23 year-old married woman. Just a minute. Mrs. Savitri Rao. Her husband is on the phone over there. His wife is in the trauma centre. Is there any other? - No. Relax, Adi. I think we are being too pessimistic. Never mind. Let's go home. Maybe she has reached home. Inform me as soon as you get some information. Yes, I am at the Wadia hospital. I'll talk to you later. We cannot remove the clot without a surgery. Our area starts from this side of the bridge... If the blast is on that side... Can't you see that I am talking to someone? I see that sir. For the last half an hour... You have been going from one side to the other side of the bridge. I'll call you back. What is your problem? Sir, it's been so long since I lodged an FIR. My wife is missing. Have you found anything? We'll tell you when we find out. Now, go away. Will the news travel to you? Sir, at least make an attempt... Make some enquiries. You should know who she has run away with. Why are you wasting my time...? How dare you assault a cop inside a police station...? How dare you talk about my wife...? Leave me. Let me go... What if I don't leave it. What can you do? Even you'll be reported missing. Sir, he's the son of Barrister Seghal. His wife has been missing for so many hours... I told you I'd take care of everything. Why did you come here? You are taking care... of me. The surgery is over... but your wife is still unconscious. You'll have to wait. I hope there is nothing to fear? - She's still in coma... We have located the FIR. The girl's husband has lodged it. His name is Aditya Sehgal. It won't be difficult to trace. You don't have to worry now. Even he is tracing her frantically. You both go home. I'm here, isn't it? No. We'll wait here. Once we have handed this girl over... Then, it's up to him. What can the poor boy do in this crisis? Don't worry. Savitri didn't do it deliberately. It's an accident. Whatever it is. We'll wait here. OK... I'll go and locate him then. Is there a Aditya Sehgal among you? - Yes. I am. Aditya. Did you lodge an FIR about your missing wife? Yes... have you found anything? - What was she wearing? A light brown sari. - Any watch or handbag? Yes. A watch, a handbag, stethoscope. I had lodged everything... Come with me. - Where? To your wife. Come on, sit inside. Over there. She is in the ICU. Suhani. Open your eyes. You would talk throughout the day. Now, why don't you speak? Say something. Open your eyes. Are you angry with me... Please don't be... Open your eyes. Say something please... Let us check... That's the man whose car hit Suhani. He's signed for the surgery as well. How is she...? You should pray... for yourself. If anything happens to her... I won't let you live in peace. How did you hit her? And why didn't you tell the police? You were drinking and driving, weren't you? I won't let you get away. It's not his fault. Then, whose fault is it? The one who is battling for her life? No harm will befall her. Before it does, I will kill myself. I hit her. It was my car. Why should you be punished for that? No harm will befall her. There is a God above. What we could do, we have done. You can give us whatever punishment you want to. But, right now even we are praying for your wife's recovery. I know you are listening to everything. You are just pretending... To trouble me... to fight with me. Come now, get up. Right now. Aren't you going to mark the date on the calendar? You didn't come home one day, And everything is devastated... How much I searched for you today... I didn't search for you like this even before marriage. The truth is that today I have understood our relationship. For the first time I have understood you. Found you. Now, I can't lose you. Till now I was only trying to find myself. Please come back... Were you scared? I just died. What did you think? That I'd let you flirt with other women so easily? What can you do for me? Can you jump off a moving train? Never say this for fun also.
