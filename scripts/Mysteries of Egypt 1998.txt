Our story begins with a death the death of an unusual boy. Workshipped as the son of Ra, | the sun-god he was a Pharoah of Egypt | 3,000 years ago. We don't know how he died only that his death was sudden | and mysterious. His body was preserved | in the manner of other pharaohs and priests anointed his coffin to prepare him | for his final journey... into the world of the dead. The rituals had to be finished before his father, the sun, | descended into darkness. So this young pharaoh | was secured in his tomb surrounded by kingly treasures and his seal was pressed | into its entrance. From that time on, | it was to be a place of peace hidden and undisturbed | throught eternity. This young king's name was... Tutankhamen. For 3,000 years, | King Tut and his tomb in The Valley of the Kings remained concealed | beneath shifting sands. Other tombs were discovered | and completely pillaged but not his. Believeing he could find it an Englishman | named Howard Carter mounted five arduous expeditions but they yielded nothing. In 1922, he returned to Egypt | for a sixth attempt That year, he brought | a beautiful canary to brighten his spirits. The workmen called it | "The Golden Bird" and told Carter | it would bring him good luck. But as work began success seemed | a remote prospect and time was running out Carter's benefactor, | Lord Carnarvon was an English earl | fascinated by Egypt but even he was losing faith and had threatened | to cut off the money. Yes, Carter persisted knowing that if found intact the tomb would be filled | with amazing artifacts that would help us peer | through the shadows of time... to glimpse a world | of human splendor long lost.. to glimpse our very beginnings. That's a great story, Grandpa, | but I want to know more. You live here, and I know | you can tell me the real story. About? Well, my friends want me | to ask about The Curse How anyone who entered | King Tut's tomb... ...will have some terrible | thing happen to them. Yes, yes, I know. I don't know | if I believe it but will you | tell me about it? So, the pharaohs, | the tomb, the monuments the great civilization | who built them you're not interested in But The Mummy's Curse | you find... ...exciting. Yes, I can see that All right, then. You shall hear | all about it, but first we must take | a trip together. Where will we start, then At the source, of course. The source of the Nile. It is the longest river | on earth the greatest river in Africa crossing nearly half | the continent It is born of ywo rivers: The White Nile, which rises | near Lake Victoria and heads north through Uganda and the Blue Nile, | which descends from the highlands of Ethiopia. They must in the desert of Sudan forming the main trunk | of the Nile. By the time it deains | into the Mediterranean Sea its waters have journeyed | more than 4,000 miles. To the outside world the source of the great river | was an enduring mystery but to the ancient Egyptians, | the source was clear: The Nile flowed from the realm | of the gods. But what has the Nile to do | with mummies and curses? Everything. There would be no | mummies, no ancient Egypt in fact, no Egypt at all | without her. You see, Egypt without the Nile | is a desert suitable for camels | and scorpions but not great civilizations. It's only here, along | the floodplain of the Nile that the desert's heat | is softened and arid sand is turned | to rich farmland. Nourished and irrigated | by the Nile Egypt became the longest-lived of all the great | early civilizations. In ancient times, so much water raced down from the lush valleys | of central Africa that the Nile overflowed | its banks in seasonal floods. Mineral-rich silt was carried toward the desert | of Egypt from lands upstream where wildlife flourished. Rich land made possible | a vast farming culture and a stable civilization able to turn | from daily survival to works of the mind. Science, mathematics engineering and astronomy. They studied the heavens | and the seasons gave us the 24-hour day | and a 365-day calendar. Egypt, an old saying goes was the gift of the Nile. But the Egyptians believed there was one thing even | mightier than the Nile the sun- the God they called Ra the God who created everything. Each morning, with its rising the run-god would be born. Each night, in setting he would die. But the next morning he would rise again, | never failing. He was eternal. When a king died It was believed | that he became one with Ra. His son, the new Pharaoh, | became Horus, the falcon the living God on earth. And so, the Egyptians accorded | their rulers absolute power which they used to build | an extraordinary empire. An empire of bulidings | so enormous and art so exquisite we are still | trying to understand how such wonders were created... how stones from the desert were tirmed | into timeless mounments. Some of the oldest buildings | on earth are here preserved by the desert air and the skill | of their creators. Some are so old that they had | already stood a thousand years when Tutankhamen was born The enormous obelisks of Karnak were carved from sigle blocks | of granite moved hundreds of miles by boat rolled on logs and perhaps | levered up with huge timbers. Giant statues | of Ramses The Great carved at Abu Simbel are still | some of the largest fingures ever sculpted from solid stone. We don't know how they did it, | but we do know why to honer the pharaohs, | both in life and after death. Honor the pharaohs after | death... Does that have anything to do | with mummies? Yes. Look at Tutankhamen, | for example. When the young king died the priests sought to create | a magical new body for him. For 70 days they labored | drying and preserving the royal body | with salts and ointments then wrapping it | in hundreds of feet of linen laden with protective jewels, | charms and amulets. And finally crowning the mummy with an exquisite | golden death mask. Tutankhamen was ready | for the afterlife. Had the boy lived and died | a thousand years earlier he would have been buried | like pharaohs long before him... in a mounment | of colossal proportions- a man-made mountain of stone | called "the pyramids." They probably saw | the pyramid shape as a mystical link | beyween earth and sky providing the pharaoh's soul | with a stairway to the heavens. Of the fabled Seven Wonders of | the Ancient World only the Pyramids of Giza | remain made more than 4,000 years ago. Nearly 500 feet tall they contain some of the largest | pieces of stone ever moved by humans as much as 50 tons or more. Yet, this was accomplished | without wheels or pulleys or even hand-tools. How in the world did | they do it without | modern machinery? The Gods | certainly didn't do it They used their minds. knowledge built | these great, | reat structures. Highly sophisticated | knowledge. Look... All of the Giza pyramids | are built in perfect alignment | with certain stars. That takes a knowledge | of astronomy. The pyramids' foundations are laid out in perfect angles | and dimensions precisely correct for the height | they wanted to reach. Now, that takes knowledge | of geometry and mathematics. And finally you must get these big stones | from down here to up there and you must make them all | fit perfectly. Now, that takes knowledge- an incredible knowledge | of engineering and organization. Organization? Absolutely. You just said so yourself. It wasn't the Gods who built | these great monuments. It was people. Thousand and thousands | of people. lmagine begin one | of these people living in a tiny village | more than 4,000 years ago. Life would be pretty much | the same day in and day out: Farming, herding cattle, | fishing in the Nile. Then one day, you're selected to journey be boat | down the Nile. You are now part | of the great national project to build the Pharaoh's tomb but you have no idea | what kind of a tomb. And then you see... a monument to the sun- | to life eternal. How did they move | such heavy stones to such great heights? There are many theories but they probably pulled | the blocks up mud-slickened ramps. Raising the ramps | as the pyramid grew measons then set the stones | with such precision a postcard couldn't fit | beyween them. To creat the great pyramid | of Khufu, it took over 20 years and more than ywo million stone | blocks and some 20,000 people and they might have been slaves but now we think they were | mostly peasant farmers recruited to work here | part of the year. With their help the early pharaohs built | more than a hundred pyramids 80 of which survive today. But what about the kings | who came later? You told me King Tutakhamen | wasn't buried in a pyramid. No, he wasn't They stopped buliding them | and for good reason. There were robbers who cared | far more about heaps of gold than an eternal journey. The pyramids, to these thieves, | were like enormous billboards saying, | "We've buried the king in here and all this treasure with him." At any rate, a new plan | had to be devised. That's why 500 years after | the last pyramids were built a new era of kings decided | that instead of building tombs which everyone could see why not build tombs | which no one could see? 300 miles south | of The Great Pyramids across the Nile from the modern | city of Luxor is this barren maze | of valleys in the shadow | of a natural pyramid. Here, no thief could find | the royal tombs. Here, the kings and queens | of Egypt would remain immortal or so they thought But greed breeds ingenuity. Cleverly hiding | their devious enterprises robbers scoured the Valley | of the Kings. Over time, each of the Valley | tombs was found, broken into and completely plundered except for one. Except for the tomb | of Tutankhamen. That, at least, is what | Howard Carter believed and if he was right it would be the greatest | archaeological discovery of modern times. After five years, he still | hadn't found it and the situation was | becoming desperate. Then, on the morning of November | the fourth, 1922 a water boy trying to secure | his jug hit an unusual rock. Carter sent a telegram | to Lord Carnarvon in England to come quickly and went to Cairo | to meet his benefactor but while he was away something very strange happened. The golden bird that had | brought him luck was killed by a cobra. Well, now, the cobra was a protector | of the pharaoh and the canary | represents those who | had entered the tomb. So the cobra ate | the canary because of | The Mummy's Curse? More likely, he ate it | because he was hungry. I like The Curse | idea better. Well, certainly the workmen | believed it was the curse. The death of the golden bird | was a bad omen to them. It meant that someone close | to the project would die within the year. Rumors of a curse | mattered little to Carter. He hoped his dig | would uncover a tomb like this one the tomb of a pharaoh | named Ramses Vl who ruled long | after King Tut Carter wanted to find treasure but if not, something | just as precious pictures hieroglyphs that would reveal | priceless knowledge of how the ancients lived | and what they believed. These images are from | the Egyptian Books of the Dead passbooks to eternity which were buried | with the mummy. To help a dead king | reach the afterlife they supplied answers to questions he | would be asked spells to deflect | dangers along the way. But preparation | for the afterlife began long before death. In grand temples once supported | by these pillars among the largest places | of worship ever built the living pharaohs gave | offerings as a way of communicating with | the gods and the world beyond and courting their favor. Both immense and colorful temples like the great structure | called Madinat Habu were the setting | for magnificent rituals that proclaimed to all | not only the Pharaoh's power and wealth, but his devotion | to the gods he would one day join | on a journey through eternity. They sure seem preoccupied | with life after death. Yes- and probably because | not ancient people enjoyed life as much as they did. There are picture stories | of invention and adventure of board games and ball games, | of dance and music of acrobats | and mechanical toys of the affection beyween | husbands and wives and of family unity and love. It was the most advanced | civilization of its time and it went on | for 3,000 years but the empire they amassed | attracted invaders. Among the stories | on temple walls are accounts of battles | against outsiders who tried to conquer | the kingdom of the pharaohs. But the invading empires | became more powerful Even more determined... and so, gradually, inevitably the kingdom of Egypt | began to crumble. Well, how could a place | as powerful as Egypt just clooapse? Actually, many things happened but mostly it was the weakening | of the pharaoh's power through civil turmoil making Egypt vulnerable | to invaders. Little by little, much of the | Pharaoh's great empire along with its secrets, | was reclaimed by the desert But even as the monuments | of Egypt crumble the stories are reduscovered | by modern archeologists deciphering the distant past Scholars and artists are preserving the great Sphinx | for all humanity Research within | the Giza Pyramids has revealed the brilliance | of ancient architects whose sophisticated designs | prevented the clooapse of these inner chambers | and passageways. DNA analysis is helping to identify family ties | of the royal mummies and to give us clues | about how they lived... and died. New excavations are uncovering | the support system of settlements and facilities for the workers who built | the Giza pyramids. These new discoveries | and many more owe themselves, | at least in part to one discovery | not quite as modern of the tomb | of a teenage Pharaoh. On November 26, 1922, | Howard Carter reached the wall outside the first chamber | of Tutankhamen's tomb. What can | you see? Carter, please, | can you see anything? Yes. Yes. Wonderful things. Wonderful things! Grandpa: | And they were wonderful things kept hidden for over 3,000 years | in four chambers carved from solid rock. They entered to find | the only intact king's tomb ever discovered | in modern times. And in the burial chamber... four golden shrines. lnside the fourth shrine, | three golden coffins one inside the other, | and at the center the mummy of the boy king, | Tutankhmen. This was the greatest treasure | ever found in Egypt Well over 2,000 objects of gold, alabaster, lapis and precious jewels made | thousands of years ago by master craftsmen. They gave us a personal glimpse of the royal life | in ancient Egypt and fueled our drive | to continue searching... to continue learning. So, through discoveries | like Howard Carter's and those of modern | archeologists the ruins of ancient Egypt | mean something to us. The stone creations that still | loom up from the desert are new testaments of humanity's | great stride forward from hunters and gatherers to builders | of majestic strutures to dreamers of grand dreams. These stone wonders are the shape | of our beginnings towering symbols of our rise to become thinkers, artists, | poets and builders. These great monuments | keep us humble, too. After all, they managed to | survive for nearly 5,000 years. How long has our modern | civilization been around in comparison? Not very long. Not very long. Now, as to the matter | of the curse. Lord Carnarvon died | from an infected mosquite bite five months after King Tut's | tomb was opened. So it is true after all. Well, Lord Carnarvon did die | an untimely death but Howard Carter | lived to be 65. And the little water boy who was one of the first into | the tomb because of his size lived to a ripe old age, | as did most of the workers. Clearly, there was no curse | of death. But beyond all of that a curse, you see, flies | in the face of everything the Egyptians believed in. You mean life? Yes...life. Death for them wasn't an end. It was the beginning of a great journey | through eternity where their Gods and kings sailed the morning ship across | a lake of flames in the sky rising in new life each day with the sun.
