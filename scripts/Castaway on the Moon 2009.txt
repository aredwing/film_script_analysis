It's the one on Han River. -Han River? - Yes, that's right. - A deserted island? - Yes, on Han River. - Get out. - Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh, no! The battery! Su-jung. That's it! Pick up! Please!

Aren't you a little old for this job? You only scored 700 for the TOEIC? Why'd you quit your old job? The company... restructuring... It went bankrupt! I'm sorry! Su-jung! I know, I'm mean. But hon... Being mean or incapable, you know what's worse? I can't do this. We're through. Su-jung! Su-jung! Fast and easy loans like shopping. Fast and easy loans like shopping. Don't lose hope. Fast and easy loans. Happy & Cash. Stupid. Getting out of here won't change anything. Attention citizens. This is the Civil Defense Corps.... Civil Defense training. Maybe I should kill myself after. Salvia flowers. I haven't tried it in a hundred years. So sweet. So sweet...I could cry. I guess I can die any time later. It's not so bad. It's delicious! The water's great! Who cares if I die eating this? That wouldn't be so bad. Everything's A-okay. Life suddenly got easier. Come on. Come on! Just a bit more! It's working! Yes! Damn it. They're all lies. So boring. Social Security Card KIM Sung-geun Are you happy? A delinquent credit card. Also delinquent. This one, too. And this... A gold delinquent card. Can't you hear me! Anyone! Can't you see me! Look! Call this delinquent, huh! This ain't delinquent! I'm living fine without those damn cards! After 7 years of saving up for a house... I finally got my own place. The duck nestles me. I am an ugly duckling... that became a slug rather than a swan. Just an ugly duckling... Almost there! Just a bit further! I need some protein, guys. Gotcha! Freeze. Don't move. It'll be over quick and harmless. How can you all be so selfish! Shut up bird! Damn bird! I'm eating it. I can do this. Kentucky Fried Chicken, 'Finger-lickin' good'. Thanks for droppin' in. Damn, that's hot. Hot! Hot! Birds taste better than fish. Perhaps evolution is the process of becoming tastier. So bored. Nothing else like it. The perfect boredom. 'Blue bear' went shopping yesterday. Chanel pumps. Save as I bought 'em at the mall. Aren't they pretty? There's no need to go outside my room. With a few clicks, everything can be mine, easily. It doesn't matter if it's real or not. The replies on my site decide that. Age, looks, jobs... Anything's possible. Are you awake? Do you need anything? Milk. Okay. I'll be a little late, today. Make sure you eat, okay? Though I haven't been out of my room in 3 years... I keep strict rules here. First, I get up after Dad leaves at 8 a.m. - Bye, dear. - I'll be home late. I get ready, then go outside. I put on 3000 steps on the pedometer before 9 a.m. I go to work at 9. I clean. I wait to go to the bathroom till mom leaves at 12! I put on 6,000 steps to digest. After some fresh air... Ah...fresh air. I plan a new life again and work at self-improvement. After finishing off at work, I pursue my hobby. Taking pictures of the moon. I take pictures of the moon... cuz there's no one there. When there's no one, you can't feel lonely. Then I put on the last 1000 on my pedometer. It's not for health reasons. After putting on 10,000 steps, I feel like I had a good, busy day. It's an all-too-healthy way of escapism. - You're home. - Hi. I sleep when Dad gets home at 9 p.m. Actually, it's hypnotism, not sleeping. To erase away the day. And to start fresh tomorrow. To be true to each new day. You're sleepy. Once in spring and in fall... That day comes just twice a year. Now, for the count down! Relax. Stay calm. Blast off! Attention citizens. This is the Civil Defense Corps.... For just 20 minutes a year... the world seems like the empty moon. It feels... lighter with1/6th the gravity like on the moon. I wish the world would freeze like this. So life could be 1/6th lighter... It's a sign from an alien! I already tried hypnosis 13 times, but it's no use. It's not my fault. I must forget. I can forget. You're sleepy. He's alive! Thank you! The alien is a freak. 'Help' changed to 'Hello'. Good shot! Instant black bean noodles Just cuz of 12 grams. I crumbled. Black bean powder, sugar, dextrin, caramel coloring... Oh, caramel... Seasoning, flour, yummy flavorings... Damn delicious Modified Glucosyl Stevia. Damn. I wanna eat this so badly. It doesn't have to be wheat. I don't even expect that much. If I can make noodles, anything would do. All the times I was stupid enough to pass on black bean noodles. I regret it so much. Just one bite, dear? Please? - No. - Just one bite? No! No! No! Eat first. Eat the noodles first! Stupid! Black bean noodles, everyone? Spicy noodles for me. If I sprinkle this down my mouth... will the craving go away? Damn it! Stop pooping guys. Eating and pooping all the time. That's why you'll always be just damn birds. Poop! Poop! That's it! That's it! Poop! Poop! This could work! Wait, wait, wait! Think bird brain! What do birds eat? That's it! If they eat and can't digest the seeds... What happens to the seeds? See! It'll work! This will definitely work! Why am I talking to you? There's definitely a seed in here somewhere! Start scraping! It's working! This scraps it good! Finally getting use out of this card! It's poop! Poop! First, I must find good soil. How can I do that? Of course. To make a field, I have to dig up furrows. And I also need manure. Things I need keep popping into mind! I'm suddenly getting smarter. Desire makes humans smarter. Always constipation or diarrhea... When's the last time I made some good poop? This can't make good fertilizer. I have to get healthier. I must make healthy poop. And... I have to make a lot. Taking dinosaur DNA from a fossilized mosquito and making Jurassic Park... Or finding a wheat seed in bird poop and making black bean noodles... which has the higher probability? I should hope for a miracle. But it doesn't matter. I got all the time in the world. It's salty. I made this salty taste on my own. Maybe it's because I ate bland tasting food. I couldn't be more proud of my salty tasting self. I feel like the most delicious thing at the top of the evolutionary chain. I'm damn delicious. I'm good! I know how you feel, bud. This suit can turn you into a scarecrow. No need for this anymore. Hopeful retail price: 85 cents Hope I've been watching him for 2 months. This is my mini homepage of the alien who can only be seen from my window. He is shy. Likes dirty things. Enjoys adventures. He's a total freak. And he's very curious about Earth's black bean noodles. Will I be invited to join... this lonely alien's community? I must go out into the Earth. Can I do it without NASA's help? Just once. Only onetime. Representing the 6 billion people on Earth... I'll reply to an alien's message. Since Armstrong... This is another giant step for mankind. Blast off! See you later, hon. Didn't you find the note? Why aren't you replying? It's a sprout! Fast and easy loans like shopping. Don't lose hope. Banana flavor. Don't you think? It's gotta be. It has to be meant for me. Then why else would it be there? It said, 'Hello'. You know what that means? Think about it. It means someone's been watching me. A freak? A psycho? After 3 months and 17days. I finally got a reply. The images and sound are slowly getting clearer. You're sleepy. That's right, a pen-pal. Writing to someone you don't know. Then you get curious and imagine who it might be. It's an international pen-pal cuz it's in English. But it's the best when you don't know who it is. It doesn't matter who it is. Right? Hey, pal! Startin' to ignore me? What's wrong? Going through puberty or somethin'? Corn...Corn! See this? We can make noodles with corn powder! It's corn! Corn! Corn! Yes, hello. You know Bam Island on Han River? How much for the duck boat? Damn it! Damn! Why me! Hello! Anyone here? Black bean noodles delivery. Black bean noodles... Hey! Ah, some woman sent this. Regular black bean noodles. Black bean noodles with onions. Sea food black bean noodles. And this is on the house. It's true... We're supposed to deliver anywhere. But this is going way overboard. Enjoy your meal and... keep the dishes. Wait! The woman... What does she look like? Man, I'd like to see her face, too. Hey, wait! God damn it! I don't care! Deliver it yourself, eat it, or throw it out! My legs are all cramped! Wait! What's with you two... That man... Didn't he say something? What did he say? You two are really somethin'. You're breaking my heart. He told me to tell you... a bowl of black bean noodles is... hope to him. I'd stay away from him. And keep the dishes. Hope. I haven't heard that in a hundred years. I'm tasting the giant hope the man sent me. It is truly the taste of hope. Truly. Truly Are you awake? Do you need anything? Then I'll be going, now. Wait... I'd like to raise some corn. What? Corn. Corn? Can you get me the seeds, pots, and other things? Sure. I'll get you the corn. Me, too. How long do I have to keep doing this? Congratulations. Hello? How are you? Fine, thank you. And you? Fine, thank you. Where are you from? Korea? Really? Oh my god! Me, too! I'm Korean. From Do-bong-gu. And...I... I hope to see you. Who are you? What's going on? Where is it? Where's the bottle? This looks familiar. That's my friend! Who are you! This is a fake homepage, people! I saw the real one! Crazy bitch! Die! Why... Why! Hey! Fierce wind and heavy rainfall is expected overnight. Let's switch to the weather for details. Reporter HAN? A typhoon warning is in effect in the southeast. It's okay! Don't worry! It'll pass in a flash! Don't worry! Don't worry! Everything will be okay. I can't even have this? It's not much... Just about to start, sir. Don't worry. Bye. Who are you? What are you doing here? You're not allowed to be here, sir. Must be homeless, sir. We came to clean... Stop! Stop right there! What's going on? Catch him! Get him! This is my land! I have to stay here! Catch him! Bastard! This is a conservation area. It's restricted to the public! Let me just stay here, please? I won't do anything bad. I gotta get the replies. Put some clothes on him, first. Give it up, mister. Let's go. Come on! Let's go! Let's just go. He's practically Tarzan. Like a savage. Does this go to the 63 Building? Is something up? No. Nothing. Attention citizens! This is the Civil Defense Corps. Attention citizens! This is the Civil Defense Corps. This is an air-raid drill. Once in spring and in fall. That day comes twice a year. Something is up. My... name is... KIM Jung-yeon. Who are you?
