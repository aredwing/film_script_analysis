"I'll see," she said, "Let's see how people are changed." The cabin door opened and a woman emerged from the darkness. "Who called you," the woman said. With an anxious tone. "Remember," said Mowgli. His throat was dry when he spoke. - Have you ever stayed in a shelter before? - Just in passing, but never overnight. Both parents are dead, right? - Leslie? - Yes. How old were you when they die? Sorry, must have been very difficult. - How old were you? - About seven. No, he was eight. Eight years. And you had any close relative with whom they live, to take care of you? - An uncle. We live with an uncle. - We? Who are these "we"? You and who else? My brother. Trixie, come on, girl! Come on, Trixie! Trixie, we have to go now! Where are you, girl? Come on, Trixie! Where are you? Hey, baby, you live near here? Have you seen my dog? A white terrier with black patches around the eyes? - No. - Oh balls, we were here to work and then came a big farmer and went out together. I've looked everywhere. - I'm a farmer. - A farmer tan? - Did you see if he was playing with a small white terrier? - No. Are you sure? - How do you call your dog? - Elvis. Elvis? It's a good name. My dog \u200b\u200bis named Trixie. - Do you think she might be playing in your garden? - No idea. - Your mother is at home? - She is at work. Yes? I bet they are now even destroy the garden of his father. Can we go see? Too fast? C'mon! Come on, sweetie. - Hello, Elvis. - Hey, Elvis. Viste a Trixie? Trixie! Come on, Trixie! Come here, girl!

For school going? - St. Andrews. - St. Andrews? I know where you stand. For the sides of Hoover? C'mon, I give you a ride! Come in, we're still in time. Come on. Why not? - What was your name again? - Leslie. Leslie, I'm Alex and this is Frank. St. Andrews. Mrs. Williams continues to teach music there? Has red hair, should look a certain age. She always played tuba, really badly. It's your lucky day, Leslie. I took a shortcut, it used to take when I went to school. - As you said that was your nickname? - Whitehead. Whitehead? Mr. Whitehead is your father? Oh my God, can you believe it! We worked for Mr. Whitehead, it's our boss! - In the water company? - Yes! In the water company! You know, I work there almost as long as he is. Sometimes I do errands for him. I think it was me who bought your last birthday. - Did you get a great doll for your birthday? - No. It's still something we need, right Frank. What will he say when you know that we give a ride to his daughter not to be late to school? Here we are. Ok Have a nice day. I'm almost done my homework, I just have a long last chapter. - Bye. - Bye. - Hello, Leslie. Soon, we'll give you a lift. - What? Your father asked us to take you, there is a problem in the water company. - I'm going home. - They are not there, honey. - Where are they? - Come in, then I explain it to you. Come on, Leslie. Get in the car. Your father is in trouble, we must go immediately. - Where is my mother? - She went to him directly from work. - Why did not they came for me? - Because they asked us to do so. It was urgent. We took you to them. Come on. So come on! Ok We take you to them. Do not worry. Why can not they waited for me? I'm not understand. Everything happened very fast. Your father called me the office and asked me to come get it. He said: "I'm having some small problems, but nothing serious. "So do not worry. Just eat your hamburger and drink your drink, and then we took you back soon. Go there. Bebe. - You have to make a phone call, Alex? - Yes, indeed. If anyone sees a cabin telephone, I will call there. Yes, she is with us and all is well. Ok, no problem. We heard you, Mr. Whitehead. Ok Thanks. Goodbye. It was your father and he said it's all in order. He'll call us later. - When can I go home? - Soon. Now drink your drink, darling. It's hot. If you drink this whole then after I give you a cold. Come on, drink it. Where are we? Okay, guys! It's time to take a bath! Ok, now you undress and jump into it. Come on, Leslie. It's just a bath, you will not bite. I'm also shy. Hey, you gotta rub well if you want to stay clean. Ok? Nobody likes boys with dirty hair. Leslie has already told you a dog called Elvis? Yellow is a farmer. Right, honey? Where is Trixie? - What, Who...? - Your dog Trixie. The Trixie, well... Frank tried to throughout city, but still could not find it... so I think she must be lost. Poor Trixie. Walking around lost. Excuse me. Hello? Mr. Whitehead! It is Alex. Yes, she's fine. ... And for how long? Are you sure? Okay, wait a second, we like to have us. We waited until you return. Ok! They still are not back. Hey, how is your hair? Do not want to wash? I do not believe you. I do not believe you. - What did I do wrong? - Nothing. I want to connect them. I want to talk to them. They would not abandon me. Will you, I know phone number of your father. You can! It's okay, honey. We're here. Let us take care of you. I, Frank and Donny, Donny is not? We take care of you. So do not worry, everything will be OK. - I want to talk to them. - Sure you do. Why do not you guard your phone number with you, and you may want to reconnect. Ok? Frank should be here new clothes for you. Let us pray. Lord, bless the food we have received We are very grateful. Bless this house and all residents and looks by the mother of Donny, hoped to return soon. Bless the parents of Leslie and helps them through this difficult period. So they can return to it. Amen. Good appetite. You walk in school? What does it say here? - Action Jack. You do not you read? - No. I actually said you could take that cookie? That's what I said? No, I not say that you could eat. What do you say? It seems you do not pretend to listen. I'll tell you a little secret? Your father and your mother does not want you anymore. They have not phoned or written, so... it seems they are very happy without you. Sometimes things are very weird... and no use trying to understand, because you'll never understand. Why are they doing this to you. Maybe Frank was right. Whatever the reason, even if your father and mother. Life is difficult. And if she is going badly for them, then suddenly you are away, nobody knows why but your life can be a little more easy here. Your father, he was always only a few days with you, right? Your mother told you it was because of work. But he did not even have time to buy you a gift for your birthday, remember? Remember? I bought them for him for you. My father was like yours. I remember that he was a long time traveling... and then came home and got together all the night, playing and reading to me. And I remember I thought this was the best night of my life. And then he said: "I have to go buy a pack cigarettes, but I'll be right back, do not worry. " But he never returned. And I never went back to see him. So I know how you feel, dear. I know I could never be your father, I look to him or take his place... but I could be like an uncle... Uncle Alex. Rest a little. - Are you crying? - No. Good. You can not cry, no one likes girls crying, girls seem ugly. Then you'll be a beautiful girl, huh. - The Alex's favorite girl. - And you are my favorite boy. Start the car. Leslie, this is Orlando. He is a good friend of ours. He will take care of you for a while, ok. You must do everything he tells you. - Ok - She realized. Do not worry. She looks good. - Ok - Go up to bed. The only thing I want is to have fun, Leslie. It can also be fun for you. Ever... Shoe Shine your father to earn a dollar? Have you ever did on the something like this? Mowing the lawn, wash the car? I think that's what little boys do, mow the lawn and wash and car. You understand, if you you do something, receive a reward. You work as you usually do... As in school... rather than just good grades, earned money. If you can earn enough money, you will not need to sleep on the street. You do not want that to happen. On the streets where the demons live. On the street you can lose yourself forever. Hey baby, what's going on? Are you afraid? What we do is good. It's beautiful. It is because of me? It is the color of my skin? This is not anything that you may be afraid I feel exactly the same as you. Want to play? There is nothing wrong with it. You know that? I am sure that this is still unknown for you, you know, except you. There is nothing wrong with playing. Everyone does. Teachers do, doctors do, police do. Everyone does. Even his father does. Your father has had touched you, if you had stayed at home. - Very soon, he would have you touched. - No! - What? - No! I want you! Come here! Shut up! Shut up! I was talking to you! I tried to be nice, bitch! What the hell are you doing with it? Honey, it's okay. It's okay, honey. It's okay. - What the hell happened? - Get in the car. Go! Go! Christ, Alex. Fuck! I told you that you would always protect? Do not let this happen again, because I will not allow. Hey! This is murder, man! This is murder, fuck it! - We are all involved. - It's all right, Frank. No one saw us! The only thing we have to do is to keep us together. And to rely on each other. Leslie, now we are all part of something terrible. But if we help each other and to rely on each other, then everything is fine. You know you? Because I will not say anything to anyone and you do not, do you? No. Do not worry. Why they left me here? I hate them! I hate them! Lesley... Leslie! It's okay, honey. Forget the past, dear You have to leave it behind. It's like a caterpillar, it has to shake his skin off to become a beautiful butterfly. And you think that the caterpillar does not suffer? Of course, dear. But this is the only way it becomes a beautiful butterfly. And this is where you you will become. Something very, very beautiful. Leslie, I think you're beautiful. Leslie, I'll never hurt you. I'll never hurt you, baby. It's okay, honey. It's okay now. It's okay. You got me. You got me, baby. It's okay. I'm so proud of you. "Something is up the hill, said the mother wolf to Mowgli. " Get ready. Behind the bushes was a small wolf sitting in the lap of his father, ready to go. "People," he said. "Young people. Look." Directly in front of him, a low branch, was a naked brown baby... I could barely walk. So fast and smoothly the evening came and the wolves disappeared to his cave. He looked at the face of the father wolf and laughed. "Is it that men are like that," said the mother wolf. "I've never seen one before." Bring him here. Small, naked and so courageous, "said Mother Wolf softly. The baby took the wrong road between the boy to approach and appeal. He will eat with the others. He looks like a toad, "said the father wolf. Then we call it that, Mowgli the frog. We should have a name secret between us. I can be Mowgli and you can be the Wolf. - Who are they? - They are the great apes.... The Mowgli is lost in jungle and the Wolf will find me, and protect me from evil monkeys nuts. This is our forest and nobody will come here. I once had a birthday party. It was with an old woman. She made me a cake a chocolate cake. He had five candles on top. - Why you ran away from home? - My mother was crazy... She said she used drugs at the library. - And then your father? - He lives in a caravan somewhere. - Where's your mother? - They put her in a hospital. That was why they had to sell you? You have more photos like these? - I do not... - No matter, I'll get some more. Then they go in the book. The book will go nationwide. I'll send it by FEDEX. If they like what they see, you will have with the client or the client comes to you. If children I fly with them. I treat the new identity. Divided 50/50. Profitable and safe. - Sure, sounds good. - This is important. - We partner discount, so if anything... - No, I do not. Sorry, I do not. I'm not like that. - Me neither. - Right. Good Anyway... So nice children. Adorable. Yes they are. But do not want to see the fly. - Ok - Okay? - Maybe another time. - Yes, maybe. Ok, so... tomas one bath. Tomas a bath first, I like that. Do not forget, is a free county. It will be okay. You know where you are going? Home of a judge. You know what that means? It is a good person. The judges are fair, are always doing good things. So, do what thou wilt. If the Judge say okay, okay. I just leave you only with good people. With good people. People like your parents. Ok? Come on. "Look, Mowgli," said Wolf. "I'll give you all the rules Jungle for the people of the jungle. " Except for the monkeys living in trees. They have no rules, are proscribed. They have no proper language, but use words stolen that they intercepted, pending hidden behind the branches. You're already dressed... Why not dress it? Your ways are not our ways, they have no leader, no memory. They are both happy to pretend they are great people to do great things in the jungle. - Who is she? - A friend of mine, Jimmy... came by to greet me. And I said it was good for she leave it here a bit. - He will return soon? - Yes. - How is your name? - Leslie. Want to climb with me stairs and play a little? Girls, I want to take care of Leslie. She will stay with us a little bit, okay? The father and I then saw tell you good night. I do not see any. Everything became funny. The tourists know they are going to die? - Everything seems to go so slow. - Yes. Yes, indeed. Be right back. What? - The cold is over. The ice, the ice cream over. - Why is it over? What the fuck. - Only a few brain cells every time. - I just wanted to use them as a sweet tooth. I just let it unfold as you do, that's all. Want ice cream? Yes? So you, Donny, do you want ice cream? So we buy the ice cream shop. - Alex. - Who wants to sit on my back? Each day of the year alone. What you'll want to eat, Leslie? - Strawberry, chocolate... - Strawberries. We have ice cream with chunks of walnuts. We flavored with vanilla, any variety chocolate. Black, milk, white chocolate. Strawberries, blueberries. We may also combine three flavors together. This is one of my favorites. And then there's the "Rocky Road". - They are $ 7.95. - Keep the change. Here you are. Thanks! I want to share, but I want get the first part of the Rocky Road. C'mon! Come on! Arise! Little fuss. Shut up. Alex! Alex! Quick! Quick! Alex, what the hell are you doing? C'mon!

Everything. - They have nothing. - Bullshit! Are precisely the people's ice cream shop. What were they doing there? How do I know? It was you. You...! - Do not blame Leslie! - Why? - Think a bit! - She fucked up! She has no guilt! Leslie never said anything! Well no, dear? Because we have a little secret, right? We have a secret. Frank. Sai outside. Get out! - Stay away from me, bitch! - Easy, boy. - Do not touch me, Alex! Do not touch me! - Calm yourself. - We'll escape this, okay? - What do we do? I'll think of something.

Now give me the money! They are really good looking! - You know that place where... - Yes! Which has a large placard of Coca-Cola? The last thing I remember the Mowgli was feel his hands on his arms and legs. And then the branches hit your face. And then he sits there looking down to trees full of vines, as the monkeys scream triumphant from the treetops. Then they begin their long journey. A trip with us to Cheer Monkey Land. is one of those things nobody can describe. Let's make a promise, Donny. What promise? Vamos ficar sempre juntos. Sempre.
