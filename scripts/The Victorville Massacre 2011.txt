I know how you get when you don't finish your lunch and all... but don't you think we oughta go in and check it on out? Didn't I tell ya to stop calling me boss, boy? Well, with all due respect sir, shouldn't we at least go knock on the door...see if anybody home. Or something? We will. Don't you think we oughta do it now, boss? Goddamn, son. What I tell ya about calling me "boss?" Not to. Jesus Christ. How old are you, boy? I just turned 21 this past November. Which means I can legally drink now. Fuckin' kids. Gettin' younger every year. You know who lives here, son? No, sir. I don't. This is the old widow, Mrs. Bates' place. Do you know how long she's lived here? 5. 6 years maybe. Bakers dozen? Let's just say: Longer than you been on the goddamn planet. You understand? No, sir. I'm afraid I don't. Old Mrs. Bates: She's 85 years old. Now how much of a disturbance you think she possibly be causing? Ain't that why we got called in, boss? You bringin' your gun? Knocks on gate Mrs. Bates! Mrs. Bates, it's Officer Bailey!~ Doorbell rings She's a little hard of hearing. What did ya expect? She's 85. Door creaks open Mrs. Bates?! Mrs. Bates?! Got a call of a noise complaint... Shit. Throat slashes Cocks gun Cocks gun Slices off arm Buzzing sound So, first day, huh? Eh. I figure it makes me look professional. Heart pulsating Cocks gun Rocks crunching Police radio noises in background News reporters on the scene Rocks crunching Rocks crunching Gurney rolling Two dead cops... a bunch of dead kids... And nobody knows a goddamn, fucking thing. Kid: We're working on it, Chief. Yeah, we're all working on it. Kid: We're working on it, Chief. Yeah, we're all working on it. But what about the neighbors?! They didn't see anything or hear anything? They're out of town for the weekend. I gotta clear my head... Clean this mess up. Make sure you fill out the reports. And get back to the office! Yes, sir. Kid... Try and keep this out of the press, will ya? Yes, sir. Ria: Jesus, when was the last time we were all together like this? Seriously, it was in like college. Now that was good times. Hell yeah, who could forget? That was the weekend Stephanie finally caved in to the Steve-myster! to the Steve-myster! No way you guys! Anyways... I was totally wasted on tequila. And that was the weekend Bobby and I broke up. You know you still want it. In your dreams I do. Laughs Besides, if I play my cards right this weekend...it'll be Lane and I doin' the dirty Slams head Slams head Opens blade Think about it... ...and I'll cut you. What the fuck?! Seriously though... Of all places to spend Labor Day weekend, Victorville? Seriously. Wait, what's wrong with Victorville? Uh, everything? Why did Matt get that place anyway? I'm not really sure, but from what he said, it barely cost him anything. That's because No one wants to live there. No, seriously guys... what's wrong with Victorville? EVERYTHING! Jesus. Fine. No, but seriously, What is the plan for this weekend? To get fucked up! Obviously. How about a little truth or dare? No way! Not with these two bozos. I'm done. bozos. I'm done. Yeah, but do you go... down? Ay ooo! Laughs Punches in groin Oh, God...right in the crotch... Come on, princess... I'm not going into the lions den alone. Ok, fine! I'm just not going to show them boobs. Come on. We've all seen your tits. God... You guys are perverted. Come on. We have to play truth or dare. It's like a cliche for a co-ed weekend. Ok Ms. Too Cool for School, what were you planning on doing? A ghost story by the camp fire. Nah uh, no way... What's wrong princess? Nothing. I'm not scared I just don't think it's appropriate. That's all. Uh, it's totally appropriate. What with, the dozen killings in Victorville in the last 6 weeks. Ok, the police say they're completely unrelated. That's stupid. How could they not be related? It's still disrespectful. Lighten up princess. We're just trying to have a good time. Feel free to join in. Who else is coming up this weekend? Matt and LIsa should already be at the house. And Andrew is picking up Mary. Isn't that gonna be a little...awkward? Why? Uh, having the three of them in the same house for the whole weekend? Look, if Matt hasn't made a move by now He never will. I mean, he's had a crush on her since high school. Yeah, there's that... And Andrew would beat his ass! It's not a problem. Lisa is completely naive. She doesn't even know that Matt is in love with her. Andrew must have her wrapped around his little finger. Andrew wouldn't be getting any without Lisa. Ok. Somehow I highly doubt that. Wait! We should toast. You wanna toast? Yeah! Ok. To what? Um. To friendship. To friendship. Cheers! Cheers! Laughs Sips This place is awesome. How long have you lived here? It's kinda funny... I was working for the guy who used to own this place just doing odd jobs here and there. And the bank was going to foreclose on it. So, he just sold it to me. So you went from working on the roof to owning the house. Damn. Not too shabby. So... how are things between you and Andrew? Since my birthday? It's ok. I mean, he's been working a lot. So I don't get to see him very much. We haven't had sex in months. ...We're friends right? ...And my birthday? Look. I think our friendship can pretty much withstand... any thing. At this point... Really? Good. Me too. Anyway. Enough about all that. What about you?! Are you seeing someone or? Uh, no. No, not at the moment. Why not?! I mean, Matt, you're a great guy. Any girl would be lucky to have you. Yeah, you know, I'm just waiting for any girl to figure that out. Laughs Shut up! Come on. Matt, they will. Don't worry. They will. You'll meet a great girl. Slams folder down Officer Gates (OS): Is that enough proof for you? That's enough, Officer Gates. I've been Chief of Police of Victorville for 20 years. We ain't never had a serial killer in this town. We're sure as hell not gonna start now. The last thing everybody needs if for everybody to panic. With all due respect, Chief... The last thing we need to do is take this lightly. Look at the photos! Look at 'em! Officer Gates (OS): Is that proof enough? What we need to do is we need to setup a mandatory curfew. We need to setup a hotline so if anyone has any information. can call in, cause we sure as shit don't. That's enough, Gates! What do you think, Bailey? You know what I think, Chief. Look. I understand the need to... avenge your partners death, Officer Bailey. But the last thing we need right now Is to be chasing obscure hunches. I told you... All of the victims were either on the verge of having their homes foreclosed or are the new owners to homes that recently foreclosed. Practically every fucking house in Victorville is on the verge of foreclosure. Let alone the nation! That'll do Gates! Jesus Christ give it a rest. Alert the media. Call the newstations and set something up. If anyone is gonna break it to this town it might as well be me. Yes sir. Besides, I'm sure the news station is gonna chalk it up to some outsider anyway. Door closes Besides, I'm sure the news station are gonna chalk it up to some outsider anyway. Bailey, hold it a minute. Take a seat. You know you should consider taking some time off... You look like shit. I'm fine. I know how important this case is to you. He killed... Clears throat He killed my partner, Chief. No one's blaming you for Maroney's death, Bailey. Hell, no one could have anticipated that sick son of a bitch. Not even Gates. Effective immediately, you're going to take a leave absence. But Chief! No buts Bailey. Go home. Have a cold beer. Have a cream soda. Do some fuckin' thing. Gates is on it. You got nothing to worry about. I don't trust him. Gates? He's your boy. He's not my boy. Bailey, gonna need your badge. Places badge on desk Seriously, I had no idea. Come on, Matt. You can't be that naive. Come on, Matt. You can't be that naive. Really? Two thuds on door That must be the crew. Door creaks open Ria? Come on you guys... Hey! So good to see you! Ria: Hey, sexy bitch! Lisa: How was the drive? Horrible with those two. Stephanie: Lane had the worst gas ever. Sorry, snowflake. Not all of farts can smell like potpourri. Matt: You guys are stacked. Some more than others. Matt: You guys are stacked. Some more than others. Shut up you guys! Steven: Time for some good stuff. We got a tradition to uphold. Tradition? We did it once six years ago. Yeah, that hardly makes it a tradition. Oh my God. I hate beer. Let's just do this shit. Steven: Ria, why don't you start us off. Ok. A toast to... A great weekend. To reunions. And like, new beginnings. To the unknown. To who give a fuck? Steven/Landen: To pussy! Laughs Officer Bailey: This is all of it? Sally: All the homes foreclosed in the past two years and their former owners. As requested. Thanks, Sally. I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this. Is it true? That there's a serial killer on the loose? I heard about your partner. It's sickening to think what happened to that poor boy. Thanks again, Sal. Hey! How are you? Good! Traffic was miserable. That Vegas traffic. Definitely. Hey buddy. Oh, nice shot. Steven (OS): Speaking of shot?! Lisa/Ria: I'll do one! Hey Matt, where can I put my stuff. Matt (OS): Guest bedroom is down the hall on the left. I'll show him. Lane: Who's ready for the hot tub? Mary: We just go here. Let's have a few drinks first. Matt (OS): Mary, it's alright. We'll make a fire, sit down, and relax. Lane: Come on, baby doll. Stephanie: Okay. Hey Matt, where can I use the bathroom? Matt (OS): Down the hall. I guess we're going to the hot tub! Yes sir. Ohhh, dude. Stephanie AND Lane. I know, man. I'm already starting to chub. Kissing sounds Thank you so much for joining me in the hot tub. I so wouldn't want to go out there with those guys alone... Yeah. It's no problem. You know what? Opens blade Do you know what this is? Yeah, I think I know what that is. Have you used one of these before? Nooo. I haven't used one. Here...

Wait, you can have teams? Jesus, you're a moron. Andrew (OS): Hey guys. What are you up to? Playing truth or dare. Want to play? It seriously smells like sex in here. Andrew (OS): Yeah? It's probably just your upper lip. Smacks Andrew: Gees. Anyways... Where the four musketeers? Matt: Uh, I think you mean three musketeers. But more importantly. Lane and Stephanie in the same hot tub as Steven and Landen? Yeah, Lane said for us to call the police if we hear anybody scream. Yeah, I believe that! Ok. So, what are our teams? You can have teams in truth or dare?! Yeah! Am I the only one that knows that? Probably because the last time anybody played truth or dare was in middle school... Or in horror films... Alright. I'll go first. Ok. Andrew: Truth or dare? Truth. Ok... When was the last time you had amazing sex? Not just the plain or ordinary sex...but like... first class, grade A, fantastic sex... I guess you'd have to ask Lisa that one. Laughs Ria (OS): Oh, God. Okay... Alright...last one that finishes their beer has to go first.... Now we're talkin'. I'm already half way through mine! Exactly. You're half way right? We just cracked open a new one. So you gotta head start. Alright...ok... GO! Chugs Stephanie: Dammit! Alright baby doll, you're up. Stephanie: Dammit!

Besides, my dick is pretty raw as it is. Oh... Now where in the hell is this firewood hanging around. Rope drops God... that was amazing... You're amazing. Where you off to? Heading out to Matt's with the crew for the weekend. What?! Why wasn't I invited?! I wanna go! I don't think that's such a good idea. Why not? We all used to hang together in high school. I just don't think it's a good idea. Come on! Pleeease? I don't know. Look, just call Matt and ask him. If he says ok, then I'll go. And if not, it's not a big deal. I guess that's fair. Plus if you give me a ride, I might give you some road head. If I didn't know any better... Blade slices through stomach Pushes blade harder Removes blade Well, that was fun. Well, that was fun. We should do it again some time... What you say, bitch? Wait a minute, listen. Faint drumming in background Oh, no they didn't! Jesus Christ. What's taking Andrew and Mary so long?

All that all the neighbors were out of town? Well, I'm sure not the whole fucking neighborhood is out of town. Uh, I'm not going out there with that fucking psycho still roaming about. Well, Jesus, we gotta do something! The fucking hell we're not! What? Nah, I'm gonna stand my hairy ass right here and not do a goddamn thing. I don't think we're safe in this room. We're surrounded by windows. What if he's got a gun? He's got a point. No. Any time this sorta thing happens, it's the people who do something that get fucking slaughtered! When does this ever fucking happen?! Um... in horror films? We're gonna go hide in the master bedroom and wait til one of us gets cell service and then we'll call the police. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! How do we know you didn't fucking do it? What? Yeah! Why aren't you fucking dead? Are you a fucking idiot? I'm just stating the facts, man. Yeah, this could be some sort of "And Then There Were None" sort of thing. How do we know you're not the red fucking herring. Ok. You know, that's fine. You two dip shits do whatever the fuck you want. I don't care. I'm going into the master bedroom. I'm going with you. Me too Me too. Look. Look. Look. Alright. All I know is for 100% fact that Landen and Stephanie didn't do it because we were in the hot tub And I didn't see either of them decapitate anybody's FUCKING HEAD! You can not be serious? I mean, he really does have a good point. I'm very serious. Ok. So you guys go hide in the master bedroom. We're gonna go hide in the garage, alright? Sighs Fine. Fine. Come on girls. Let's go. You know, if Matt did do it, You know, if Matt did do it it's probably not a good idea to let him out of our sight. Especially with the two girls. Especially with the two girls. Hell, that's how the judge got away with it in the book. What a minute... The judge did it?! Let's go. Car pulls up Bailey, what the hell you doing out here? Just getting some fresh air. I don't think it's such a good idea to be out here like this. Do you? Probably not. Tell ya what... Why don't you go on home, and I'll forget this little incident happened. Yeah. Have a good night, Bailey. You too. Starts car Door creaks open Landen: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Steven: Of course it is. There's only 1 way in. That means there's only 1 way out. Again, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Stephanie: Where are the lights? Landen: Guess this'll have to do. Steven: Nice. Shovels fall Screams Steven: Jesus! Asshole! Steven: Why does Matt have so many shovels? Landen: This whole thing is insane. Stephanie: I can't believe this is happening. Steven: Yeah, well, it is... Just gotta find a place to hide. You guys think the killer is gonna find us in here? What? Knocks on door What was that? Sounds like someone's at the front door. Aw, man... Should we answer it? Should we answer it? What?! It's not like he's just gonna knock. "Hey, I'm here." You actually make a pretty good point. Yeah, I know. Loads gun Should someone go check it out? Yeah, I'll do it. No... I should do it. Yeah, you should go. What was all that talk about, "I'm not gonna do a thing." Well, I figure I'm better off out there than just being a sitting duck in here. ...Fucker... Ok, guys, I'll be right back. Be careful. Hey, check this out. I'm a little rabbit. Jesus Christ. Think we should check on what that noise was? No way. Are you kidding? Only an idiot would go out there. Both: Steve. What are you doing? I gotta have something that's... better than a pool cue in here. I don't know... This thing's pretty heavy. Ria: You find anything? Uh, no... Matt: Nothing. I mean, not yet. I guess if we need to shoot him in the corner pocket, we'll be alright. How's she doing? How do you think I'm doing? What's taking him so long? I don't know. I haven't heard a single thing. Have you? No, nothing! Sighs Maybe I should go check on him. What?! Leave me all by myself? No way! Look. Landen's my best friend, alright? We look out for each other. If something were to go happen to him... And I didn't even go check... I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror. I think that is... the bravest thing I have ever heard in my entire life. May be the bravest thing I've ever said. Scuffles under tarp Steven: You're sitting on my keys. What the fuck?! Get the fuck off me! Punches face Stephanie: Oh, my God!

And then Steven went to go check on Landen. And then we start making out on the boat. And then, and then the killer came along and starting stabbing us with the knife. With the knife... And then, and then, Steven took a big shovel and hit him. And then, and then... Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait, honey. Shh. Shh. Shhhh Out of breath You and Steve made out? Jesus, Mary, Joseph. Knocks on door Landen (OS): Let me in! Let me in! It's Landen? Oh my God! Are you ok?! I'm fine. I'm fine. What happened? Where were you? The killer...I went outside. We got into a scuffle.

I don't know. I don't know. Ok, obviously this isn't getting us anywhere. Ok. I'm gonna go out there. What? You can't go out there! Why not?! Because the killer might still be out there. Well, what are we supposed to do? Just wait here like sitting ducks?! That's exactly what Landen said before he.... Holy shit! Matt, where did you get that gun? I've had it the whole time. I didn't know if you were in on it. How do we know you're not in on it?! Because I would have already shot your ass! That's how! Ok, we're not thinking clearly here. You're goddamn right we're not thinking clearly! This whole situation is out of control! First, I have to listen how you and Andrew haven't fucked in God knows how long. And then I have to sit like a jackass in my house and listen to you two fuck in my guest bedroom. And then my friends start getting fucking murdered left and right. and all I wanted to do was try and impress you this weekend, Lisa. And now I got a gun. And I'm in control. And I'm calling the shots. What? All I wanted to do was try and impress you. Now this whole thing is my fault. It's not your fault, Matt. Either way... I'm gonna fix it.

Why don't I just take you? Because Matt is picking me up? But that makes no sense? Why would he drive in all the way from Victorville when we can just take you? Uh, because he's a good friend. Just a friend huh? Yeah, Ria just a friend. Ok fine. Then I'm gonna make a move on him this weekend. What?! Jealous? No I'm not jealous. I just didn't think he was your type. That's all.
