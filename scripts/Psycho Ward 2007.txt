All you did was find an open door. Plus, don't you think it's a little strange the door was open in the first place? No, my cousin tells me the college kids come here to party all the time. Check out this place. So why did you bring me here anyways? Do you want to lock me up, do a little role-playing? You told me the thought of making out in dangerous places turns you on. Doesn't the thought of making out in dangerous places turn you on? Honey, the thought of making out in a broom closet turns me on. Did you hear that? No. Come on, are you gonna let me out of here or what? Are you gonna give me a reason? Are these good enough reasons? Well, do you have a condom? What the fuck? What? There's something down there. Ken. Ken, would you get back here, please? Ken, come on. Would you shut the fuck up? There's somebody down here. Well, why don't you ask him if he has a condom? You know what, buddy? You just lost your ticket. Fuck! Ken! Ken! Ken! Which road was this supposed to be on? You've got the maps, genius. You tell us. Bite me, musclehead. Only if you bite me first. I think we're lost. I think we all need some air. I told you guys I'm not good with maps. What was the name of the place again? Black Creek Detention Center. And we need to visit this place because...? Because the world has a right to know what really happened there. Right right, the whole evil-doctors- experimenting-on-prisoners thing. I'm surprised you were listening to anything I said. I caught something by accident between naps. The way you were snoring, I'm surprised you didn't catch some bugs. Tino, try your contact again, see if you can get directions. Who are you calling, Tequila? Your mom? No, a friend. I met her online. She lives around here. Yeah, right. Say hi to your mom for me. Don't you want to stretch your legs? I'm fine. Are you sure? I told you, I'm okay. Please tell me this is the last abandoned prison on his list. No, three more after this one. Nice. There goes my next three weekends. This bites, man. Looks like we passed it over an hour ago. I got directions and my contact's meeting us there. Nice work, Tino. Let's go. Who is that? I guess she's my contact. Life's cruel sometimes, isn't it, big guy? Okay, if she's your contact, what's her name? I only know her online name-- Babelicious. Mac Daddy 85? Is that you? Mac Daddy? Hi, thanks for the directions. I've been here for half an hour and I haven't seen the groundskeeper yet. But the gate was open, so he must be around. Oh, this is my crew:. Dr. Magellan-- it's his film; Studds is on camera; Sarah handles the research; and Lisa is in the van. We're urban explorers. I'm usually into more dangerous places, but I figured they could use my help. I have my own website. Hi, everyone. I'm Monica. I brought some of my dad's old plans of the property, if anyone would like to take a look. I'd like to see those. Where did you find her, man? Some website she created. It was all about this place. I emailed her and said we were coming up to take a look around. She said her dad used to do maintenance here and that she'd be happy to show us around. You did good, kid. You did good. You can never be too careful out here. So you're a doctor? Yes, of criminal psychology. Why would a shrink be interested in a prison that's been closed for over a year? I'm not a shrink. And I have my reasons. Welcome to the entrance of the psychiatric wing at Black Creek Detention Center. Before they shut it down over a year ago Black Creek held some of the country's most deranged and violent criminals. Infamous for its advanced and cruel psychiatric rehabilitation program, Black Creek faced numerous charges of mistreatment and malpractice over the years, although nothing was ever proven in court. Is he for real? Yeah. He believes that a handful of people have been performing mind-altering experiments on unsuspecting prisoners for the last 75 years. Here it comes. Two years ago three prisoners from the psychiatric wing escaped from their cells, killed two doctors and burned themselves alive. The police concluded this was part of an escape attempt, but I beg to differ. I've interviewed people who worked in the prison before it was shut down and they tell me it was more than that. They tell me it was revenge-- revenge for what the doctors in there did to them. Those three men were unwitting patients in a top-secret military program called the "Pandora project." The Pandora project's sole purpose was to eliminate fear in the human soldier. The program failed on all counts and made the patients neurotic and completely unstable. As usual, the military disavowed all knowledge of it, but less than a year later this entire facility was shut down. Why? That's what we're here to find out. And cut. How was that? Good for camera? Just peachy. Great. Let's get some closeups. So you guys explore abandoned buildings, tunnels and things like that? You know it, babe. All of us have a natural curiosity about the world around us. Studds gets a rush from being somewhere he's not supposed to be and documenting it on film or video. Tino likes to lose himself in the history of the place. And Sarah likes the smaller details-- the design, the architecture. What about you? I'm interested in the things society covers up. I remember the fire here, but you said those men were involved in some kind of military program? I never heard about that. It was top secret. You wouldn't have. All three were facing life terms with no chance of parole. Donald Pier, a serial murderer. While working as a janitor on a large college campus, he abducted and killed six students in the early '90s. Gordon Cale, a racist and psychopath. He shot and killed three people who lived on his street because they weren't white and he thought they were polluting the neighborhood. And Darrell Coombs, a cold-hearted killer. He killed seven people in the '80s and signed the bodies with his "C" so no one else could claim responsibility. Why would the military even want to be involved with people like that? Who else were they gonna get? No person of sound mind would ever agree to someone digging around inside their head for no good reason. I still don't see why anyone would agree to that. So, boss, when do we get to see these secret labs? Secret labs? Come on, you said it yourself-- places like this always have secret labs, you know, where they take some poor retard's brain and slice it and dice it and turn them into zombies. I don't know if I'd describe it quite like that. I've investigated several prisons that were rumored to have participated in the Pandora project but Black Creek is by far the most promising location. So you're saying that could have happened here with those three men? I'm saying that's what I intend to find out. You jerk. Okay, let's check the footage, lock up the equipment and turn in. I should really get going too. It was nice meeting all of you-- well, almost all of you. Well, there's a tree out there with my name on it. I'll meet you guys at the van. Do you mind if I use your tent? This thing is soaked. Do you mind if I use your tent? This thing is soaked. Yeah, sure. It's cool. Thanks. Studds? I am really sorry about that. It's all I had with me. It's for the beach. Do you like it? Yeah, it's nice. Well, I guess I should be going. Okay. You're supposed to say, "Do you have to?" Did you hear that? Studds, is that you? I think it was a door. Let's go see. Should we get the others? I'm sure you can protect me. Hello? I think it was the groundskeeper. Looks like they went inside. Let's go see. Looks like they're gone. Let's go anyway. Are you sure? What's the matter? Nothing. Okay, then let's go. Does anyone have any batteries? There's a bunch in my bag in one of the tents. Thanks. Time to die. Lisa? Lisa? You asshole. I thought it was Tino. I swear it was just a joke. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. You are so fired. Am I the only one who isn't carrying a knife around here? Eugene, what the hell were you thinking? I'm all right, Richard. He just scared me, that's all. Eugene? This is too perfect. We need to talk right now. Where's Tino? I didn't see him when I came back. Was there a light on in there before? I don't know. I thought there was no electricity. Professor? Damn it, see what you started? It was Tino. There was someone else-- someone behind him. Are you sure? Yes. That horny dog. How did he get in there? And when did that light come on? There's not supposed to be any power in here. That's what I said. I thought I made it clear that we ought to stay together. I think someone was thinking with the small head. Should we go look for him? He must be with the hottie. Her car is still there. Okay, you guys stay put. Don't move until we get back. Thanks a lot, guys, really. I'm sure we can fend off some crazy psycho killer by ourselves. Men. Sorry. I'm sure there's no psycho killer. Tino, is that you? What is this shit? I don't know. It could be someone having fun with us. Maybe that chick invited some of her friends. Maybe. Something's not right. This place is supposed to be locked up and there isn't supposed to be any power. So? So Monica said they shut the electricity off. She said a lot of things. Let's go. I'm telling you, dude, he's getting laid. Please just tell me what you want! No! No! No! No! No! What are you doing? Thinking ahead. As soon as they get back, I'm the first one into that van. Man, I hate camping. So do l. Well, it's not really the camping part. It's being stuck in the middle of nowhere with a flimsy piece of nylon between you and whatever's outside that really freaks me out. Tell me about it. Did you hear that? Hear what? There's someone out there. Run! What the hell was that? I don't know. But if it was Studds, I'm gonna kill him. It stinks in here. It smells like dead people. You had to say that, didn't you? Where do you think the guys are? Couldn't have gotten that far. I told you guys to stay put. Someone was after us. They sliced through the tent. Sliced? With a knife? We ran. We didn't see who it was. I don't want to stay here. Could we just go? Sure, as soon as we find Tino. He's got the keys to the van. That's just great. Hey, boss, there's something you need to see over here. Did you find Tino? No. I found something else, though. Come on, you two. Oh, no, I'm not going any further. Sarah, we need to stick together. That's right. And we can do that here, near the door. Boss, are you coming? You really need to see this. Sarah, please. I really don't want to leave you two alone again. We'll be okay. You see anyone that isn't us or Tino-- you scream. We can do that. Do you see something down there? Just shadows. Your mind playing tricks on you, huh? I guess so. Come on, it's in here. Look down. Did you find something? Sorry, man. What? I said sorry. Shit. That is fucked up, man. The girls. We need to go. You have got to be kidding me. Did you hear that? Sounded like a door. Richard? What? My last relationship ended badly. I don't need this shit. I really don't. I should have just stayed home and read a nice-- Shh. I think I hear something. Richard. Hey. We should wait here. Hey. Richard. This is nuts. Lisa. Wait. Please don't take off on me like that again. Don't sneak up on me like that. Sorry. I'm sure I heard someone up ahead. It sounded like yelling. We should go back. They might have went back. We would have seen them. Maybe they found another way around. I don't think so. Come on. Don't touch anything. It's gonna be a crime scene. Do you think Tino's, you know, dead? Me neither. I guess we wait. Lisa will come looking for us eventually. She's never followed instructions in her life. If they find the two of us dead in here, people are gonna talk. If they find the two of us dead in here, you won't have to worry about what they're saying. I think it was coming from in here. See? No one here. Let's go back. Wait, Lisa, Sarah, it's us. - That was so not funny. - The door closed behind us. I think there's a release on the outside. You we'll save. Him we'll leave in there. Oh, I thought something happened to you. Don't I get a hug? Where's Tino? We haven't found him yet. Let's get back to the campsite. He could be there. The campsite? Someone tried to kills us at the campsite. Let's go. Um, guys... Sarah, open the door. It won't open. Is that the door we came in? Of course it's the door we came in. I'll call 911. The fire department should be able to get us out. I'm not getting a signal. Does anyone else have--? I'm not getting a signal. Neither am l. It's no good. I remember Monica telling me earlier you had to go into town to make phone calls. There has to be another way out. We should just stay here and wait for someone to find us. I'm sure the groundskeeper will be back soon. The groundskeeper could be the one that locked us in here. We don't know that. We don't know anything yet. Let's smash out one of the windows. Shatterproof glass and steel bars, designed specifically so you couldn't break out. Okay, then let's split up and look for another door. If one was open, there might be another one. Split up? No, no splitting up. We should just stay here and wait. Sarah, I'd like to agree with you, but we need to find Tino. Or what's left of him. What do you mean? Did you guys see something? We saw blood. You guys walked right over it. Two minutes. That's actually a minute longer than I expected. Sorry, dude. This isn't happening. Let us out! Please! Open the fucking door, please! Hey hey hey hey. Nothing's happened to Tino. Hey, we're not even sure it was blood. - You're not? - No. Then what was it? Paint. It could have been paint. Look, we're going to get out of here, but we all need to stay calm. Are you sure? Lisa and I are gonna head upstairs. You two start down here and check all the rooms. If you find Tino or his friend, stay with them and keep your eyes open. We'll meet back here in 20 minutes. You're making me go with him? No one goes anywhere alone. We're on the buddy system from now on. Buddy system? Will you be my buddy, please? Okay, but if you touch me I'll spray you. Let's move. This is it-- Black Creek. Weird shit happens around here. People go in-- they don't come out. Okay, you showed me the place. Can we go now? They're just stories. You wanted to see it. Look, there's cars over there, probably a party going on. Let's check it out. You check it out. I'm staying here. Suit yourself. Tino? Tino. Look what I found. What is it? It's an electrical box. The building has power. This place must have its own generator. Look, the power house is just south of here. I remember seeing it earlier. So? So there were no bars on any of the windows. If we can get to it we can get out. There should be a passage in the basement. Let's keep moving. - Wait. - What is it? I think this is the room I saw Tino in. Are you sure it was this room? I think so. I kind of remember windows in my head. Plus this is the only one that doesn't have any bars on it. Do you think we can get out? No, it's shatterproof glass. Besides, we're three floors up. Well, I don't see anything. Do you have to do that? Sure do. I'm gonna post this on my website-- urbanstudd.com-- Do you realize how insane this is-- being stuck inside a prison? I know. Isn't it awesome? Awesome? Tino's missing and you think it's awesome? He's been gone for, like, an hour. And as much as it pains me to admit it, that chick wanted him. But you guys saw blood. Yeah, lots of it. What? Nothing. Hey, open a few of those cupboards for me, will you? Did she seem strange to you-- Monica, I mean? She seemed hot to me. It's like she knew something but wasn't telling us. Maybe she's part of some sick cult and lures people in here for blood sacrifices. Nice. Do you think they get naked? 'Cause I would love to see her naked. Oh, shit. Get off me. Get off me. I said get off me. Took you long enough. Is she--? She's alive. It looks like this was the warden's office. This is as far as we go. Let's start heading back. - Richard. - What is it? I heard someone in the hallway. Hello? Hey, asshole, we're talking to you. Down there. They're playing with us. I thought I saw someone earlier as well. Shouldn't we go after him? Hey. Magellan, Lisa, is that you guys? What's he carrying? Is it--? Oh, no. Tino? Nope. Bring her in here. She jumped me down in the kitchen, so Sarah used the flashlight on her-- bam!-- in the back of the head. That's a lot of blood. It's not hers. I might have been hurt if not for my ninja buddy over there. That bitch killed Tino. We need to get some answers. Where is Tino? I don't know. Was he with you? We have to get out of here. What happened? Listen to me. We have to go now. Unless you have a key that will open any of these doors, we're not going anywhere. Whose blood is this? I got him in the shoulder, got him good. Did you do something to Tino? We have to get out of here. You have to get us out! This chick is whacked. She's in shock. We're not gonna get any answers from her like this. Let's find the passage to the power house and get out of here. Power house? There is a passage in the basement. It leads to the power house. There's no bars on the windows. We can't leave Tino. Tino's dead. We all know it. We can come back for Tino. I can't just leave him. I'm responsible for him. You're responsible for them too, and me. I'll stay. You guys find the passage and get help. Suits me fine. Come on, my pretties. No, we go together or not at all. Okay. We all go. Her too. No, there's a door here-- a door! We can get out. We need to get out! Someone shut her up. No! No! What if we just leave her? Because she might be the only one who could tell us what the hell is going on here. We need to get to the boiler room. Can we just go, please? Which way? Through there. That figures. This corridor leads to the western part of the facility. The boiler room is just past the larger room and dining area. Everyone stay together. It looks like a dead end. Is there another way around? There might be. It looks like some kind of open service tunnel. Luckily, service tunnels are my specialty. Okay, Monica-- She's gone. You were supposed to be watching her. We'll find her later. We gotta go after her, man. I'm telling you, that chick is nutso. You didn't see the crazy look in her eyes when she attacked us. Studds, get back here. Studds! Somebody please tell me I'm dreaming. If you are, it's contagious. For heaven's sake, we need to stick together. I told him she was in shock. Shock? Shock? Don't you get it? She's behind all this. It's some kind of sick game she's playing. Sarah, this is a classic case of post-traumatic stress disorder. This isn't one of your lectures, Magellan. This is real. Sarah, I understand that, but we don't know if she has anything to do with what's going on here. She has everything to do with it. I disagree. I wonder if you'll disagree when she chops up your little sister. Richard, stop. You owe me 80 bucks, bitch. Shit. No. Let me go. Please. Please let me go. Don't. No. Don't, please. Please please. Don't. No, don't. We're all gonna die in here just like Tino. Not if I can help it. You can't help it. Don't you see? This was all planned-- that girl meeting Tino online, the groundskeeper mysteriously disappearing, lights on when there's supposed to be no power, unlocked doors when they're supposed to be locked. Doesn't any of this sound strange to you? So what would you have us do, just sit here and die? Sounds like a good idea to me. She's gone. All I saw was what was left of my belt and some blood. She must have cut herself trying to get free. Great. She's free. I also found this. I'll hold on to that. What's the matter, boss? Don't trust me? Of course I trust you. Keep it. You need it more than I do. Let's find that tunnel. This should take us through to some sort of storage area. Once we get there, we head through to the dining room. Backbreaker. I'm all over this. I know I'm wasting my breath, but please be careful. See you on the flip side. Stay there when you get to the end. Looks like it goes right through to the other side. I won't take long. Good. Keep your eyes open Can do. I can't see him. He must almost be through. It's all clear. Okay, we're coming through. Oh, man, what did I just stick my hand in? Suck it up, Sarah. This is the way out, remember? See you on the flip side. Get going. Tino buddy, is that you? Marco. Marco. Damn it. Sarah, is everything all right? Did you guys hear that? Hear what? I must be going crazy. This shit's starting to make me jumpy. urbanstudd.com is gonna rule next month. The soup's on. Oh, shit. Studds? Eugene. He's gone. I told him to wait. Studds, you in here? Where did he go? I don't know. Maybe he's up ahead. Damn. What? Did you find something? Is it bad? It's just an old sheet, but it looks like Studds was here. Why did he leave? Where's the boiler room? It's through there. Sarah. Fuck, man, what is this shit? What is this shit? Fuck you, asshole. Please do not do that again. "Stay together," I know. I just had to get out of there. What's that for? Most likely a guard up there during meals. If the crowd got out of control for some reason, they probably used tear gas to subdue them. Come on, the boiler room's through here. The boiler room's in there. Are you sure? I'm sure. Let's go. It should be up here. Where's the tunnel? Are we in the right place? It's right here. It's supposed to be right here. Some of these bricks are newer. It looks like they sealed it off. We're screwed. I knew that we should have just stayed by the front door. Someone would have found us. I need more time to find another way out of here. You can wait. I'm going back. Sarah, stay-- Let's go find her. Oh, come on. Come on, which way was it? The keys. The groundskeeper. Are you the groundskeeper? We've been stuck here for hours. There's some psycho chick after us. Oh, man, what's that smell? Try to breathe through your mouth. Where is it coming from? Down there. Lisa, I have to check it out. Stay here. Okay, please hurry. Richard, what is it? Nothing. Just stay there. Damn, Tino. What did they do to you? Why couldn't you just listen? My God. Sarah. Richard, what did you see in there? Richard, wait. Stop for a minute. Lisa, what is it? We need to find Sarah. She's out there all alone. You saw something in the cells or on the camcorder. What was it? There's someone else in here with us, someone bad. Lisa, we need to go. Go? Go where? We're trapped in here, remember? And until you tell me what's going on, I'm not moving another inch. Now you're acting childish. Childish? You've known something was wrong the whole time. You've kept it to yourself to be in control, same as you always have. Everything I've done has been to protect you. Protect me? What about Tino, Studds and Sarah? Who's protecting them? If I tell you who it is you'll say I'm crazy. Just tell me. Darrell Coombs. One of those prisoners you told us about? I thought he died in that fire. I don't know how, but Coombs is here. Coombs was one of the most systematic killers in recorded history. He fancied himself an artist. He'd put on a mask to create a very specific persona. He'd incapacitate his victims with a deep belly wound and mutilate their faces using whatever he had. And he always signed his work. Are you sure you want to see this? Everyone's dead except us. No, Sarah's alive and we can save her. I know it. Richard, what is this place? It's a chapel. When they caught Coombs the police asked him what he did after he killed his victims. He went to church to repent his sins. We need to hurry. She said she was going back to the first door. Well, I hope she knows where she's going. Her sense of direction needs work. I knew it. She went the wrong way. Sarah, Sarah, are you in here? What is that? Sarah's camera. He's gonna kill her. No, he won't. I won't let him. Won't let him? He's already killed Tino and Studds. How are you gonna stop him? He killed Tino and Studds because they got separated. We won't make that mistake. We'll find Sarah and stay together. We need to go back. Go back where? To those cells. Whatever he's doing, he's doing it down there. It's where the old psycho ward was. That place with that awful smell? It won't be easy, I know. You want to go in there? We have to. That's where he's taken her. Lisa, wait here. Please hurry. Oh. Damn. Sarah? Hey hey, are you okay? I think so. I need your jacket. We have to act now, while we still can. Can't we just hide somewhere? Someone will eventually come and find us. If we hide somewhere, Coombs will eventually find us. We are trapped in here without food or water. Now we can last a while without food, but after two or three days without water we won't be in any kind of shape to fight him off. Look, men like Coombs can only do things like this while they're in complete control of their environment, when they feel secure. That's probably why he came back here. He spent almost in this place. It's been easy for him up until now. We have to change that. How? How? He's in the chapel. After he killed Sarah he had to go there to repent. He's vulnerable right now. We can attack him in there. Attack him? Attack him with what? Follow me. Lisa, find a weapon-- anything. - Richard! - Lisa, run! Richard! Lisa, the chapel! Destroy the chapel! Destroy the chapel! Please open. Open. Come on, you bastard. Finish what you started. Richard, you're still alive. The keys-- Lisa, get the keys. No fucking way. What is it? Lisa... take the keys to the van. Drive until you can call 91 1. But you're coming with me. I'll be right behind you. Richard! I'll see you in the next life. Richard! No! No! No!
