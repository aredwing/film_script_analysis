You were to rehearse the children once more before this evening's entertainment. - Oh, no, I forgot. - Is anything wrong? - Listen. - What? The wind. There isn't any. You're not listening. It's faint, but it's there. Yes, now I hear them. I wish you hadn't made me. - You know what they are? - Yes. The winds of Santa Ana. And if I weren't totally certain of our beloved Almighty they would scare the life from me. - You're frightened of the winds? - I didn't say that. My only fear is God. How long before they get here? Within the day, I imagine. But who knows. They come and go as if to intentionally catch you off guard. We better get back before the little atoms destroy the orphanage. Have you seen Tommy? No. Why? Rise. Rise, my children. It is time. Rise. The time has come. Rise. Rise. Rise. Rise. When all the world Hears this song They will want to sing Right along Sing of the sunshine We'll find When we leave The rain clouds behind Tralalala Tralalalalaia We'll find the sunshine When we leave the rain behind When all the world Hears this song They will want to sing Right along Sing of the treats We will find... Mitzi. Tralalala Tralalalalaia We'll love each other And we'll leave the words behind When all the world Hears this song They will want to sing Right along Sing of the joys We will find When we love all of mankind Tralalala Tralalalalaia Tra la la la la la la La la la la la la And think of the joys We will find When we leave The rain clouds behind Tralalala Tralalalalaia We'll find the sunshine When we leave the rain behind Damn it. Damn it. Damn the winds, damn the bridge, damn everything. You're much too attractive to be so bitter. Oh. You startled me. Forgive me. I am Count Yorga. Count Yorga? You mean a real count? Yes. Oh. How marvelous. - And that isn't a costume? - No. Oh. Forgive me, that was thoughtless. - Not at all. - Yes, it was. I'm Cynthia Nelson. How do you do? How were you able to get here with the bridge out? I flew. No, really. I recently acquired the old Gateway Mansion. You're kidding! Then we're practically neighbors. I love that place. Whenever I can't sleep, I often jump in my car and drive there just to look at it. - Yes, I know. - Oh? You look magnificently beautiful in the moonlight. Shall we go inside? - Bravo! - Bravo! Very good. Cynthia! Jason and I are getting married. What? Jason, wonderful! Terrific! Jennifer dear, have Marie put the children to bed right away. No, no! It's much too late. They can have their party tomorrow. - When? - Soon. - Where have you been? Hi. - Hi. My sister and Jason are getting married. - You're kidding. - No! - Congratulations! - Thank you. - Let's go tell my folks. - Okay. Do you like this kind of music? Only when played well. Cynthia! Cynthia, have you seen Mitzi? No, Joe, I haven't. Hey, Claret! Oh, this party's a bust. Our daughter is marrying a toad. - Oh. - Terrific. Ah, here you are. David, this is Count Yorga. The new owner of Gateway Mansion. This is David Baldwin, a psychiatrist and adored fianc. How do you do? Doctor. I was just telling David how the Santa Ana winds may have had something to do with the bridge collapsing. Well, perhaps the count isn't familiar... The winds of Santa Ana are world famous. How do you do? We haven't met. I'm Reverend Thomas. Count Yorga. Reverend Thomas is in charge of the orphanage. It's a pleasure, Reverend. And this is Jennifer, without whose help the orphanage would collapse. How marvelous! How is it you know sign language? When you've lived as long as I you gather a bit of knowledge along the way. How absolutely marvelous. - Hey, Moses. - Coming! Well, hurry it up. We need the hard stuff. Excuse me. I hope we can talk later. That would be nice. - Are you coming? - Yes, yes! Coming! - She wants you to dance. - Oh, yeah? Jennifer. He's mine. Would you care for some punch? No. No, thank you. How long have you been at the orphanage? Most of my life. - And have you never traveled? - Yes. I visited a few places, but I keep coming back. This is as close to purity as I can get. Purity? Purity of what? Love. Life. That matters to you? Yes. Very much so. Unfortunately, I find it difficult to evaluate life and love on the basis of purity. However, truth. Cold unemotional truth... One's loss of innocence holds it. Excuse me. I should be telling you over and over again how elegantly beautiful you are. Instead, my cynical philosophy jumps to defend itself. Oh. Please. An old Bulgarian cure. Time for the winner! Time for the winner! Gather around, please. Come, come. - Gather around, please. - Mitzi! I can't remember when I've had such fun. You must live a very exciting life. Oh, another vampire. - Where are your fangs? - Where are your manners? The winner of the best costume for this evening's festivities is... - Cynthia? - Wait a minute, Reverend! - Cynthia... - Tommy. - I can't sleep. - You can't? You see? It's the winds. Can I stay at your house tonight? - Bad dreams? - I don't know. - I just can't sleep. - Sure you can. Go on and get ready. Jennifer will take you to the house in her car. - Thank you. - Good night. The winner is... ...Michael Farmer as Count Dracula. Really? Sorry, old buddy. Wouldn't it he something if vampires did exist? Are you kidding? I'd love it. - They do. - David. No, they do. Not in the classical sense, of course but there are those who thirst for blood. - Thrive on it, in fact. - He's right. Nonsense. There might be a few isolated cases where some have used it in ceremonies, but... Why do you discount the possibility of a classical vampire? Oh, come on! Well, even to consider it is absurd. Twentieth century, man on the moon, remember? Well, you are joking with us, aren't you? Well, let me point out that nobody has ever seen one. Perhaps, you haven't. But there are scores of people all over the world who have. Oh? - Have you? - Yes. - David. - I'm sorry. You don't expect me to take him seriously, do you? Mr. Baldwin, I suggest you seriously anticipate the possibility of anything. One never knows when one might encounter some of the more unusual truths that exist in our world. Hold it! Ah! Ah! Oh! Oh! Come! What is it? What is it? What happened? - Mitzi? - What happened? - Mitzi. - Is she all right? Did you see it happen? No, when I came in she... Well, I found her like this. Please, please stand back. Please don't crowd! Mitzi. Shouldn't we call a doctor? - Joe, did she drink much? - No. Maybe two. - What's that mark there? - Where? - On her throat. - I don't know. Wait a minute. She's coming to. Mitzi, how do you feel? Dizzy. Mitzi, can you tell us what happened? All right, all right now. Just relax. Everything's going to be fine. Take it easy. You too? Well, you have to admit that something's odd if all three of us are this edgy. Oh, all I'm asking is why. What is it? - A feeling. - That's right. - Oh, come on! - It's a feeling. Oh, boy, I tell you! Marcia, I think we raised ourselves a couple of scared? cats. - I'm on their side. - Oh, I forgot. - Listen. - What? Shh! -Huh? I grant you that night winds do stir the imagination. But you three are behaving like summertime in the ghetto. Don't you sense a strangeness? An unwanted curiosity? Unwanted curiosity? Now what kind of talk is that? Something's out there. I better secure those shutters upstairs. - No, Bill. - Oh, honey. - Don't leave us. - Oh, come on, honey. Mother, you're trembling. Listen, Ellen, go get your mother a shawl and I want you to wake Tommy, and bring Jennifer in here. Right. Tommy, darling, couldn't you sleep? - No. - Come here. Sit beside me. Cynthia, give Tommy some hot chocolate. - Sure. - There. How's that? Now, you just relax and the hot chocolate will make you sleep. Now I'm getting jittery. - Oh! - Father! - Ah! Damn! - Bill! Get him into the kitchen, and wash it. How did that damn thing open? - I thought I'd locked it. - Are you all right? I'll just take a little water, please. I wish I knew what it was that you all made me so afraid of. Marcia, I'm going to take a look around outside. - Bill, please stay, don't leave. - No, daddy, don't go. Please. What's the matter? All right, take it easy. Take it easy. - Is anything wrong? - No, darling, nothing's wrong. Where's Jennifer? Oh, no! No! No! No! No! No! Cynthia. This is Count Yorga. I want you to relax. Relax completely. Permitting the innermost resources of the mind and spirit to open with unguarded trust. Relax. Relax. You are to forget everything that occurred in your home this evening. It will he wiped from your memory forever. All you will remember is an automobile accident. An accident that occurred in front of my home. And that we, you and I, are friends. Cynthia. Cynthia. Who's that? Count Yorga. Oh. Hello. Thank you for taking care of me. It was very kind. Will I be all right? The doctor wants you to rest here for a few days. Till you gain strength. My family? I notified them. They'll be by tomorrow. Poor mother. She's frightened of the least little scratch. May I call them? Not now. It's late. For now, sleep and get well. We'll talk tomorrow. Thank you. Good night. Good night. I'd like for you and the boy to wait here. - I'll stay with them. - All right. She says that window was broken. There were others, but that one she remembers. That's been there for a long time. She says what she tells us is true. There were mutilated bodies in this room drenched in blood. God help us. A letter to Jennifer. "Dear Jenny. We received word that a relative of ours is critically ill, so we had to rush." She says it's a lie. "...so we had to rush. "We'll be back in a few days. We'll call later. "Love to you, the reverend, and the children. Cynthia." Tell the gentlemen what we saw this morning. Tommy, do you know where the Nelsons are? They went away. - Where to? - I don't know. Why didn't you tell us this before, Tommy? The boy was sleeping. Why would they leave you alone, Tommy? Why didn't they take you back to the orphanage? I don't know. She thinks the boy must he in shock. - Did you see them leave? - Mm-hm. Now what? I'm sorry, but we have to assume everything's okay. There's no evidence to the contrary. Hello! Hello! Hello. Nothing makes sense. There's discrepancies, that's for sure. Discrepancies? Jennifer says she saw massacred bodies, Tommy says no. I'd hardly call that a discrepancy. One or the other is an insane liar! How do you accept a story like Jennifer's? Question is, can we afford not to? Why wouldn't Cynthia call the reverend if they were leaving? Or tell Jennifer? She lives in the same house. I answered that one. It was late, and they probably thought the boy would tell them. Are you sure Cynthia never mentioned having relatives? Uh-huh. Even the reverend was surprised. He never heard of any either. I feel so bloody helpless. Jason, what do you know about this Count Yorga? Only that he's some madman who believes in vampires. Why? Well, I was just thinking about Mitzi. Remember those marks on her throat? Oh, now, wait a minute. You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you? Well, what else do we have to follow up on? You better go visit one of your colleagues. Jason, of course I'm not saying I believe in vampires. But we've got to begin somewhere. We can't just disregard Jennifer's story altogether. We've got to go on the assumption that Jennifer's story is true. I agree, but I mean, don't tell me you're thinking in terms of vampires. Well, we don't know, do we? David... Well, I mean. Maybe Count Yorga is right. Maybe they do exist. You ever heard of Professor Rightstat? No. He's devoted his life researching folklore and the occults. Vampires? Well, for 30 years I've been battling the impenetrable mystique that enshrouds that fabled domain. I've seen the tatters of their desiccated flesh, clinging to wooden stakes wedged deep between their ancient crumbling ribs. Why, I once saw a little child clutching its slashed throat ripped loose by razor-edged fangs. - Professor... - Time, time and again I've offered my life to prove vampirism to the world. Professor Rightstat, would you help me investigate Count Yorga? Uh, Professor Rightstat? Huh? - I said, would you help me? - Kelp you? Uh, no. Help me. Would you help me? - Oh, help you! - Yes. Uh, with what? Investigate Count Yorga. Yoga? Yoga? Oh, no, no, no! No, I don't believe in yoga. Oh, sheer poppycock. Tried it once about, oh, 40 years ago. Got caught in one of those damned locust positions. Took three men to unwind my body. Well, what's that got to do with vampires? You haven't read my book. Come on, let me play. Come on, Tommy. Give me the ball. I must be allowed this experience. I must find out if I can recapture this emotion so long kept from me. You're a fool. When she discovers what you are she'll sicken at your name. She will loathe you. Kill her. If you do not, you may never see another moon. You must not allow her to live. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. I found these clothes. I... I hope you don't mind. Not at all. What matters is that you look most beautiful in what you chose to wear. Thank you. Whose are they? To whom their belong is unimportant. Thank you, Brudda. - You're not eating? - No. Brudda told me you were walking about today. Oh, yes, it was lovely. You really shouldn't, you know? Rest is necessary. But I-I feel marvelous, thanks to you. In fact, I was thinking about going home tonight. - Oh? - Yes, I... I wanted to call my mother and father, but I couldn't find a phone. Good night, Cynthia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I really have enjoyed working for you tonight. And now I would like to introduce our next performer who I know you're going to dig a lot, Miss Theresa Jordon. Oh, there are things about this world We cannot see or comprehend Yet they are there Yes they are there Think it over, think it over And then think it over Once again Far beyond the mist Where life is lived What's the matter, Joe? Nothing. I don't like the way you look. - Let's get you to bed. - I'll be all right. - What the hell's that now? - A fuse? No, probably a loose wire. - I can manage, Joe. - You sure? No! No! No! No! No! Cynthia! Hello? Cynthia! Ellen? Is that you? Who is it? Who is it? Who's there? Cynthia! Cynthia! Stop it! Cynthia! Stop it! Please. Cynthia. Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Stop it! Stop it! Please. Help! Help me! Help. Please! Oh, no. Now, Tommy, for the last time, what were you doing at Count Yorga's house? I told you, Reverend Thomas, I wasn't there. I've never been there. Why would Jennifer say you were if you weren't? I don't know. I just went for a walk like I always do. Honest. Why would I lie? - Why would Jennifer lie? - I don't know, sir. But I sure wish she'd stop accusing me of things. I like her and all that, but... Jennifer, are you sure, dear? Jennifer. Are you all right, Tommy? Yes, sir. It only hurt a little bit. Jennifer, I'm sorry, but I have to ask you this. Do you think you might've imagined these things? Could it have been a dream? She says, "Your Ellen is dead. They are all dead." Sure wish she wouldn't talk like that. Those are terrible things to say. Tommy, you better go to bed now. It's very late. Yes, sir. Good night. Good night, Jenny, and no hard feelings. Tommy. Do you know what a vampire is? No, sir. What was that for? David thinks Yorga might be a vampire. What? I'm going to see Lieutenant Madden. I'll come with you. - That's preposterous. - No, you stay here. Reverend, can Jason sleep here tonight? I'd like him to hang around and keep watch, just in case. Yes, of course. - Okay? - But vampire? Keep this with you. - Oh, come... - Please! A vampire? Oh. - How well did you know him? - A little. Madden, I've got to talk to you. Sure, go ahead. I want to take a blood sample. I can't do that. What do you want it for? - I want to check for something. - For what? Human saliva. What? Chief. You know, there's definitely signs of a female having been around the boat. How informative. Show me a boat that doesn't have signs of a female. What are you looking to prove? You wouldn't believe me. Look, Baldwin, I'm just as bugged with Jennifer's story as you are. And I'm willing to break a few rules, but give me a decent reason. And it better be a good one or forget it. What? Vampires? What the hell are you doing? I'm on a homicide and you're playing games with me. I'm not playing games. Lieutenant, I know I can't hack it up. Oh, really? I wonder why. Look, just give me the blood sample and I'll leave you alone. No. Vampires. Well, what do you think killed him? Don't tell me, does it fly? You saw his neck, you saw his face. He could be your twin brother, you wouldn't recognize him. I know it's only- I'm sorry, Baldwin, I got to say no. Okay. All right, let's keep it moving. Get out! Tommy, what are you doing up? You won't get mad if I tell you something, will you? What? - Promise? - I promise. I did go to Count Yorga's like Jennifer said. Well, why didn't you tell us that before? I don't know. Ellen's there. - Ellen? - Mm-hm. Want me to take you there? No! No! The boy. Ready. Tommy. Tommy? Tommy? Tommy! Hello, Jason darling. Ellen. My God! What's happened? Have you missed your Ellen? Ellen? You're frightened. You don't love your Ellen any more. Ellen. Ellen. Ellen. Please! Ellen, stop it! Stop it! Come in, Cynthia. Why do you hold me here? I've recovered my strength. Why do you keep me? Cynthia, I have survived many, many years. Count Yorga. New you appear. The most fragile emotion ever known has entered my life. The one I must fear the most. It will surely threaten my ability to survive. You, Cynthia, have brought to my life a gentle pain which I can only define as love. Can you love me? Please. Please. I could destroy you. Or turn you into the living dead. Or let you go. Let me go. Relax. Relax completely. Relax. You take this? Yes, sir. So? Count Yorga was in that picture. Who's Count Yorga? The man I suspect of being a vampire. You still on that kick? What do you mean, he was in it? He was in the middle of that group when that picture was taken. Where is he now? That's just it. We don't know. Maybe flew away. He was there when I took it. And when I developed it, he wasn't. You always develop pictures? Yes. He was standing right there. He raised his arm over his head, as though he didn't want me to take it. And everybody looked at him, as they're doing there. Now, will you believe me? Okay. We'll take it to the lab and check it out. Damn it, Madden, what's to check out? There's no time. Let's go to Yorga's and at least talk to him. David, surely you can't believe... That picture proves something. I don't believe in vampires either, but it's possible. It is possible, isn't it? I mean, nobody has proven otherwise, have they? Boys. Yes, Reverend? Boys, have either of you seen Jennifer? - No, sir. - Not me, sir. All right, you can go. We were idiots to have waited so long. Jennifer, God bless her. She did all she could to warn us. Just hope we're not too late for the others. Take it easy. We're not even sure they're there. They're there. And when we talk to this Yorga guy, no accusations. What are you saying? We can't let him know we're there. If he should be a vampire... Get off that kick, will you? Madden, please, even if you don't go along with my hunch, at least give it a try. We can't let him know we're there. He'll beat us. You're asking me to enter illegally? Yes. At a time like this even Jesus Christ would fabricate his intentions. Lieutenant, please, let's do it my way. Why take chances? And what's your way? Let Reverend Thomas go to the front door and work his way in. Do something to keep the Count occupied. Talk about fund-raising or some damn thing. I don't know. Anything to distract him. While we find another way in and search the place. That's a very ingenious plan. Unique. Reverend Thomas, what a pleasant surprise. Excuse me, Count Yorga, it's so very late, I do hope you don't mind. Not at all. Please, don't get up. Thank you. Make yourself comfortable. This is, uh... This is very kind of you to give your time like this. You seem distressed? I do? Oh, I suppose I am a little. Excuse me, Reverend. But it's such a lovely evening. I thought you might enjoy a stroll in the garden. We could discuss your problem under more pleasant circumstances. Oh, I'd like that very much, very much indeed. Please. To he blunt, I'm in search of philanthropic assistance. Well, then, you've come to the right place. What are you doing? These will be our only weapons. - You're kidding? - No, I'm not kidding. Now, if he comes at you, you put these two sticks like so. He's afraid of crosses. You're nuts, you know that? Maybe. Here. - Here's yours. - Get out of here. I'm telling you they'll be your only protection. I don't want two pieces of sticks. You'll make a cross out them. I don't care if you make a star of David out of them... Take them. - Come on, Madden. - Take the sticks. Look, if I have to hold two pieces of wood, so do you. Now, you're sure you don't want to go with us? No, we'll cover more ground if we separate. Let's go. All right. All right. Now, don't forget, no playing a hero. The first one that finds the vampire, - screams his ass off. - Right. Chief, he's got you believing that stuff. Come on- $20,000. I can't tell you how deeply moved I am. It's my pleasure. I'll draw a check for you when we return to the house. $20,000, I can't believe it. That's the largest donation the orphanage has ever received. It's purely a selfish gesture on my part, I assure you. For I believe that the helping of unfortunate children cleanses lane's soul. Don't you think? Yes, I do. Most definitely. I hope so. - Don't push. - Who's pushing? Would you care to hear something amusing? Please. There's been talk of your being a vampire. Oh? No. The whole thing is utterly ridiculous, of course. Of course. You have a rather strange garden. I really must apologize. I haven't had the opportunity to give it much care. I've been here such a short time. I somehow like it this way. Wild, unkempt. It gives you a free feeling. Count, would you help me please? I've hit a loose spot. Count Yorga, please? I'm having difficulty, please? Count Yorga, in heaven's name, please? What? You... You led me to this. This was your purpose. In the name of God, man, please? You devil! You vampire! You never intended donating that money. You sick, tormented monster! You'll never get away with this. There, there, you madman! How do you like that? Jason. Chief, I sure would like to get the hell out of here. Yeah? Thought you didn't believe in vampires. Wait a second. Hey, you down there. We'd like to talk to you. What the hell are you doing? Well, let's talk to them, they might know something. Yeah, what've we got to lose? Now, please, don't be nervous or frightened. We're not here to harm you. We're from the police department and just want to ask a few questions. I'm Lieutenant Madden and this here is my assistant, Sergeant O'Connor. And I don't think this was a very good idea. Anyway, I must warn you that the law states that anything you might say may he used against you. And so forth and like it goes. Chief, I think we ought to split. Yes. Good. What are we running for? 'Cause we're scared! Where have you been? What the hell did you get us into? Come on, I can't find Cynthia. Look out! - Boy, I think we're in trouble. - Oh, really? Cynthia! Thank God. Thank God you're all right. Is your family here? - I don't know. - Come on. This place is endless. Back! Hey! Madden! Oh, my God! Easy now. Hold it right there. Keep your hands in sight. I've got to warn you. We're prepared to open fire. Oh, my God! Now do you believe in vampires? How do you get out of this place? O'Connor! Lieutenant! - Are you all right? - Yeah, I guess so. Hang on, I'll try to find a way in. Okay!- - O'Connor! O'Connor! - No! O'Connor! O'Connor! Madden. David? How are you holding up? Come on, there's got to be a way out somewhere. Dr. Baldwin. This is Count Yorga. You are going to die. You are going to die a most horrible death. You've been a fool, Doctor. And now you are to die. Yorga! Let her go, Yorga! Yorga, do you hear me? Let her go! Stop it! David! No!
