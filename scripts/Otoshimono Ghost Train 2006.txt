That was just a joke, don't worry! Noriko...? What're doing, Sis? Nothing. Excuse me to disturb you. We're informed, that somebody found on the rails. Until further confirmation we can't continue traveling. Give it back... How...? Sawajiri Erika Wakatsuki Chinatsu Oguri Shun Sugimoto Aya Itao Itsuji Asada Miyoko Mum! Noriko! She kept asking me to visit you before school. Sorry to trouble you with this silly examination. Why? The illness is better to be found a. s.a. p! Mum's heart is really ill? You really don't have to worry about it. That's right. I'm fine. Why do you always leave me out? We don't! But you do! Noriko! Thank you, Noriko. Fukuda Takashi - Missing I wonder where did he go... Me too. Because I picked this up... What're you doing? Nothing, let's go now. Kanae! What? What this? Present from me. I worked for it part-time. Really? Do you want me to put on? Yes, try it! It'll suit you! Right? Yes, it will! If you say so! Perfect! Soon we'll arrive at Mizunashi Station. What about it? What's that? Super-cute! Shigeru said he worked part-time just to buy it for me! Q: [What're you planning after school?] A: I'll look for a job. Hey, comittee chairman! What's that, Fujita? Just a minute! Look what she's writing! What an awful kanji! It's really horrible! That's my choice! Excellent! I hand in. Go, go! Here you are! I give it to you later. Ha-ha-ha..., don't lose it! My interests: pregnant Don't scrawl again! When will you start studying abroad, Sis? Won't you feel lonely? No... Then will you be fine if I come home late tomorrow? How come? If I work part-time, can you go alone to Mum? I can. Look, it's because you didn't place it well. Why do you make a fuss about it? Ah... What's this ticket? I put it up at the Station, but forgot to give back. Give it to me. I'll give it back. Why? Anyway, just give it to me... You're acting weird again. Give me a break! This is the 4th in this month! This time you deranged the railway schelude, and confused thousens of people. Did you get it? But it's true...! I really saw it! In the tunnel...! You're not gonna tell us lies, right? Well, you'll stay in the office for a while. But that's... Until your memory comes back. Just use your head and try to remember. Another clumsy newcomer! You won't always get your reward after the good job. The secrets of this place is digged in the past years. A dead body can be somewhere too. Don't pull a long face. It's much easier than be a motorman. Try to enjoy your work! I'll work hard just to get my former job back! Don't go back! What? There's no way for that. Who would allow you to drive again after your ghost-story? What? Ghost...? Silly! Just joking... joking. I told you I didn't saw it! Sis! Noriko, why are you here? Let's go to the hospital together! Why don't you go alone? Come with me, Mum feels so lonely. You're the one who always alone. Today I'm working. All right... Noriko! Be careful on the way! Leave me alone! Thanks for giving it back. Ok. Takashi! Give me back! Bye! Bye! Your sister didn't come today... No... bye. You have one message. Hello! I just saw Takashi at the Station... ...it seems he came back. I'll be back soon. Noriko...? Who is it? Takashi... Give it back... Takashi? Give back... Who are you? He still doesn't answer! Really? Then I think this was his last present for you! Shut up! You're still wearing it? He just found it. Found? He found it in the train... You sat so close, yet didn't noticed. What a nice present! That bastard! Ouch... it doesn't open! Did you put on fat? I really can't take it down. Can't take it down... Excuse me... I'm the sister of Takashi's classmate.. Anyone home? Did my sister, Noriko come here? Excuse me... Help me... help me! He's not Takashi, he's not Takashi, he can't be! The train will arrive soon to the platform 2. Please step back, for your safety. Shigeru! Ok, I got your joke, but... ...take it now down, really! It hurts! Shigeru? Stop it! Stop... Please... No...! Shigeru! Kanae! Shigeru... Look out! Yaeko... she's dangerous! Let me go! Shigeru! Shigeru! Shigeru...! Did she say something about Noriko? She's now in really bad condition. This is not the question I can ask from her now. But she might be with Takashi! I heared that you saw him on the balcony. No... But you said so before. That was not him! Then why did you say that? What did you see? I'd like to speak with your mother once. But she's too weak for that! If she gets to know this... Maybe she can help us too. I told you I don't know! He did it with his own will! She...? Kanae... Why do you always cause trouble? You'll attend school for a while, and try to grow up fast! Kanae, did you hear Dad? Yaeko is dangerous! Kanae! Kanae... A child? Give it back... give it back... Sis... ...why didn't come with me? Give it back! Noriko... Hello? Yes... Noriko is...? It's a record from Mizunashi Station, 2:03 a. m. She's Noriko. Are you sure? Yes, she's my sister. Where is she now? We're informed that a local officer checked the area, but didn't find her. Yes, that's right. That's not possible! What's this? Somebody's... somebody's here! Just an ad paper doll. No, somebody's following her! Just a shadow of something. I think she's alone before this glas. But... Well, until now we never lost our calmness before further confirmation. Calm? How can you talk about calmness now? She was walking alone. Maybe she ran away from home. When she kept saying that she sees somebody, I felt creepy. That can't happen in real life! Wow, it seems you retured to yourself! Can I go back to the driver's office? You just rest a bit! She just a little girl, right? If you know something, please tell me! She's still in grade school. It's all my fault! If I were with her, this wouldn't happen. Please, help me. I really don't know anything... sorry. Sis, try hard for your exam! When will you start studying abroad, Sis? Won't you feel lonely? No... You're getting used to this work! Hey! Did you saw it in that tunnel? What? Then it's maybe true... Wait! What're you talking about? What's this? Places of accidents. All around that tunnel... The tunnel takes a strange curve there, right? Do you have something in your mind? No. Long time ago, when the tunnel were digged... ...people said they found something terrible. What was that? I only heard this from my older colleagues. That was just a silly, cheap story! Did you believe it? Please, don't joke with me. You know... you better find a different job! A strange looking woman told me I'll die soon. Because I picked this up. I found this on the station, but forgot to give back. It's dangerous. Can you show me something? Aonuma Yaeko... Aonuma Yaeko? What're you searching for in the book of lost items? Noriko and Takashi, both of them found a ticket of one person before they disappeared. Really? Look... here and here too. Here's too! Who the hell is Aonuma Yaeko? She must be ultra clumsy. I really saw him. Takashi... Who? But he was not human. It's just an ordinary ticket. Maybe it's here on the shelves. What? It's not here... Where did...? Do you know Yaeko? Who... Yaeko? She killed Shigeru. Before he died he said that. What's happening? Is this related to this bracelet? Somebody tell me who's Yaeko! Leave me alone! What? You thrust him to the rails. You're seen! You are the killer of Shigeru! That's not true, not true... Killed... you have killed... This is the curse of the bracelet. No! Do you want to know how to dissolve the curse? You want to know, right? Nooo! Give it back! Help... help... Fujita? Are you hurt? It's ok, thanks for trying to help. Sorry. Why? You made me cool down a bit. You're the only one who tried to remove it. Why didn't you ask your friends? They're not my friends, I just hang with them. I'm afraid alone. If I don't hang with others, I'll be excluded in no time. Yes... Sorry for the rude things I wrote on the paper. I didn't want to harass you. I just still don't know what'll I do. I understand it, because I feel the same. You too? You were just doing what others expected. Maybe... It's not your fault! Kawamura! Aonuma Yaeko? Aonuma Yaeko... my sister found her ticket too. This is also found in the train... Maybe this is also her lost belonging. I remember that Shigeru said someting similar before he died. What did he say? "Be aware of Yaeko. " Probably she's the one I saw. She had a stange figure with long hair. She also tried to drag me at the station. She's still at the station, maybe. Don't go! You'll get killed! Shigeru warned me. He was going to die, but he just cared about me! He was a showy, silly cheater, but... ...at his last moment he helped me! I won't forgive the killer of him. I'll need help. Come with me! You don't want your sister back? On the security camera's record... ...there was a woman too beside Noriko. When we played it... ...a station officer looked also pale, as if he aleady saw her before. He must know something! He? What does this mean? Why do you know about her? You saw her too, right? You better don't dig up anything! What is it? I still fear. It's from Mum's hospital... Yes? What? I see... Mum had a spasm... Ok... you just go and visit your Mum. I'll be ok, you just go. Don't worry, I'll look for your sister... ...and try to be rid of this, too. If we're through with this all, let's chose a same school for us! Everybody'll be surpzized that we became friends. Right? Wait a bit! I meet you later. Ok. Sorry, I made you worry. I feel better now. Mum... You're under so much pressure, and now you have to take care of Noriko too. That's no problem. But no matter how hard life seems... ...never give up on yourself. Why do you say that? Just don't worry about me. I have to go now. I'll come back later. Help me Nana! What happened? Where are you now? At Mizunashi Station. That woman... she's...! Fujita? Kanae! Give me back! No... no! Have you seen my friends? Your friend? Why... It's your fault! What? Why didn't tell me anything? Why do you pretend to know nothing? Me? Give me back Kanae, give me back Noriko! Calm down! What're you saying? You already know! So, you knew it! Let's meet somebody who can help us. Kawamura! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! I saw! Kawamura! Kawamura! Why didn't you tell me anything? It's my... ...fault to pretending nothing happened. I didn't want to belive it... that's why! Give me... No...! Calm down. You're safe here. Who're you? You too found it... Then, you too? Wish I could found it,... ...but the one who found it: my son. I had only him... Yuuki! Give it back! But he was not Yuuki anymore. I lost my beloved son and my eye. With this "it" became visible... ...although nobody should see "it". "It"...? Should not see...? It wants to take you away. Never ever go back to the station! I have to go now, my friend is searching me. This is it! So it's the same bracelet... Bracelet? It seems these things were lost after the inspection. Lost? You too heared that voice... ...Give it back! - she said. Yaeko's searching the items were stolen from her. She's prowling in this area. But I still don't understand her persistence. That's just an ordinary bracelet and a ticket. There was a baby? This is what Yaeko's searching. We won't find her in other ways. Let's help her to see the baby, and I'm sure she will... I don't think that would help us. The baby is already dead. Where did she die? You know it, right? Noriko and Kanae must be there! Then, I'll go alone! I come with. Get in. Hello. Nana, it's me. Kanae? You're safe, I'm relieved. That's my line. I'm relived too. Kanae, so good to hear you. So you're still alive... ...I'm so happy that you're safe. Silly... why are you crying? What I'm I saying? Then, calm down until I come back. Where are you going? To a tunnel near Mizunashi Station. Yaeko died there. Why? Maybe I can find Noriko there. Wait a bit. Do you know what you're saying? You know... Yes? Thank you... ...for taking a picture together. Why do you bring this up now? As I saw how good friends are others... ...I felt jealousy. That's why I was really happy that moment. Nana... Knowing that you're alive and safe I'm so relieved. Wait a bit! Take care! Please go as far as you can from here! Where are you going? I must stop her! If you go near that'll be the end for you. Look! You're going there to die? What's the use of? I go there for Shigeru. I couldn't save him. Don't force me! Nana's the first with whom I became friend. She's the only one. And now she's going to the place of that woman! We have to go through this. Don't worry. We can't escape! Kumi! Run! Give me back! Please save Nana! This way. Noriko! Be careful on the way. I got the keys. Kanae died. That's not true! She couldn't escape from that woman. Who're you? You're on a wrong way. She died because she wanted to stop you. Stop torturing me! Until I find my sister, I won't give up. And you? I'll go with her. Do you want to see more people dying? You're so naive. You better stay here. Why? We can't drive this, if something happens with you. Still, I want to come with you. If you do so, we can't escape. Wait here, and I promise I'll be back with her. I stay. Let's go. Wait for us! I will! Yuuki... that's your fault that Yuuki's..! Where are we? What was that? Yaeko was also a victim? There was a baby? Let's help her to see the baby, and I'm sure she will... Even if we appease her, she won't stop? What the hell is this tunnel? This place is... ...a madness... our madness. My son... how dare she do that to my son! Besides... Noriko... Sis! Noriko! Noriko! Sis! Sorry that I left you alone. Sis! Give it to me! Yuuki... you've done this with my son! You are the... That means you killed your mother! Now I can finally meet my son. Noriko, let's get out of here! Noriko! Help me, Sis! Sis! Sis! Sis! I wanted to save both of us... Don't ever touch her! Kanae... Why? I'm just so happy! And let's go to the same school together! Let's meet later. Ok. Are you ok? And Kanae...? Get out of here! Hold on! Thanks for helping. Sure. Yaeko was not the only one there. What've been buried there? And what was that place we discovered down there? I won't overlook! What do you mean? The tunnel takes a little curve there, right? Do you know something? Long time ago, at the construction... ...they digged out something horrible. Today, there was an explosion in a tunnel near Sanyou Railway's Mizunashi Station. Noriko! A part of the tunnel collapsed by the explosion. After the explosion near people took shelter... ...from the fearful noise. Just after the explosion a worker of Sanyou Railway... ...is arrested at a police box as culprit. He's name is Kuga Shunichi. The suspect stated as his own action. Shunichi... Don't worry, it's over now. Mum! You were together today, right? I can tell. I'm finally home, Mum! But, we're not home yet... I'm glad to be back home too, Mum! What a funny children you are! Ok, welcome home! Welcome back! Thank you... Kanae. I'll never forget about you! The train will arrive soon to the platform 2. Please step back, for your safety.
