Check out the rails on this, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no, Jesse. No, Jess, not today, mate. - Maybe next time. - (Jesse) Oh, come on. That's not part of the deal, Jess. You gotta get in the contest first. - Like I'm not gonna. - (Roy) See ya, boys! - Thanks, Dad. - See ya, Dad. Fuck it, man. It's got the new H2s and everything. - (Scotty) Hey, Ripley. - How are ya? - Nice board, mate. - Yeah. It goes good, eh. (Horn honking) (Danny) Come on, move! Get this shit out of the back! (Scotty laughs) (Danny) Whoa, sorry there, mate. Sorry, Sonny. Go on. Don't just stand there like a bunch of flaccid penises. Get this shit out of my car! - You're the one that's late. - Come on, Sonny. Move it! You, erm, you have a couple last night, Danny? Yeah, get that bloody deckchair, too. I'll be needing that. - (Horn) - There's your call, mate. - Fuck off. I ain't staying here. - Just like your bro said. Half-brother, and don't say shit about him. Righto, righto, righto. Righto. Shut your cakeholes. - Now we got two spots. - Two spots? - (Danny) That's all they're giving this year. - Shit! - There go your chances. - Get fucked, Ripley. - Oh yeah? - (Jesse) Yeah, really! - Really? - (Danny) Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, cut it out! Cut it out. Any aggro or dropping in is going to cost you points. I ain't the one... - You want to stand there all day... - Oh, fuck's sake. ..or did you come here to fucking surf? Why don't you give me your boardshorts? I'll give you a skirt. - Keep going. - Righto. This is how it's going to work. Cunny, write this down. Everyone will have 15-minute heats. Best two waves, the two blokes go through. So, erm, Jesse. - Er... Fuck, what's his name? - (Scotty laughs) It's Nathan. (Danny) Nathan. Nathan, Ripley and Andy, you're up. - It's ours. - Fuck, yeah. Yeah, what about me? Yeah, well... You and Cunny can keep score for me. Hey, Derek. You're on the horn, mate. (Sounds horn) (Laughter) Fucking hell! Not in me ear! Fuck off! Give me the bloody horn. Get out of it. (Barks) Oh, Andy! My arse. His first wave, Andy gets a nine. Give him a nine. Give him a nine. The boys are up. (Jesse) Move! Oi! Oi! Double! Check it out! Hey! Shitheads! Double interference! You get nothing! Nothing! - (Sounds horn) - Shitheads! You would have got an eight but you get fucking nothing. - You blew my ride! - Fuck off! It was mine! You didn't fucking call it. - Get fucked, Jesse. - Prick! You just stay the fuck out of my way, Nathan. Jesse, chill out. There's going to be another wave. Later, faggots. Give him a six. Six? Ripley? Fuck, give him a seven, then. I don't give a fuck. Shit! You know, it ain't an ashtray. Yeah, it ain't a toilet either, but we still piss in it. We're all going to have to put in some extra time this weekend. We've got to overhaul a big one that's coming in. Don't look at me. I got off. So do some of the other blokes, but they're still willing to put in. Why would I do that? 'Cause this is the job that feeds your kids now, right? Not bloody surfing. Yeah, you got that right. They get every bloody cent. I'm just trying to help you out, son. (Foghorn) A little too late to be playing daddy. You know, I stuck my neck out for you. Damn it, Fergus! Hi, Mick. How's the water? - Ah, it's good today, Bette. - Good. Who's that? - Bette. - (Laughs) Bette? Hey. How long? - Just over a minute. - Is that all? - Well, you're not a bloody fish, mate. - I'm trying to build my lung capacity. Well, just get Jess and his mates to teach you to surf already. Yeah, like that's gonna happen. - (Jesse) Why the hell are you surfing? - Uh-oh. - All you do is fuck things up! - Don't even fucking go there! - It was my fucking wave! - (All shouting) - I didn't make it either. - Oh, like you had a fucking chance! - Fuck. - (Andy) He's right, it's not that big a deal. You don't even wanna be in the fucking contest, Andy. I mean, do you want anything? Oh no, that's right, you've already got it all. Jess. How'd you go? Fucking third. Man, I'd give you my spot, but my Dad would kill me. Oh, that's big of you. You want to talk about it? You sure? Just keep at it, Jess. Your time will come. A whole 'nother year in this shithole, Gramps. You've got a funny definition of a shithole, Jess. All right, here it goes. I reckon we should hit Stocko this weekend. - Here we go. - Camp the dunes, get some waves. (Scotty) Be sweet as. (Nathan) How? (Scotty) Ah, you. - Me? - Yeah, you. You got your Ps. Like my olds are gonna let me drive out there. Fuck. His olds. How about if you just don't tell them, you dickhead? Funny, Scotty! (Andy) Aren't your parents going away this weekend? - Yeah, to Sydney. - Hmm. Well, there you go. What do you reckon, Jess? I'll snag some beers off Danny again. Like I'm going away with you fucking tools! It's better than spending the weekend with Victor and Fag Boy. Don't say shit about Victor. You don't know nothin' about him. Oi. Jess. Hey, Jesse. - (Jesse) Hey. - How's it going? - Hi, Scotty. - Hey. - (Debra) Hi, Andy. - Hey. Oi, wait up. What are youse doin' this weekend? Youse wanna hang out with us? - What are you doing? - (Debra) I don't know. Maybe. (Giggles) Hi, Nathan. (Mimics) Hi, Nate. Why? You guys going somewhere? Well, erm, Nathan has got a car, you see, so... (They laugh) So yeah. - (Laughter) - (Nathan) No. No. Hey! Piss off. OK, what if I can't get the keys? Oh, you'll get 'em. No. Mum'll stash 'em somewhere. Or take 'em. She's not stupid! - Neither are you! - Exactly. Look, come on, Jess. Stop being such a pussy, dude. Debra's gonna go and you'll get your chance with her. - She said she's keen. - Do you reckon they'll show? Shit, yeah! Leah's like totally into you, dude. All right. I'll tell my mum I'm training at yours. Yeah, youse all say you're staying at mine. Me, I'll say I'm staying at Nate's. We'll be back by Sunday. No one will ever know. Exactly. Come on, Jess. No surf fest, man, but looks like you could be taking Debra's V, who knows? More like she'll be taking his. (Scotty laughing) Oh, yeah. - (Toilet flushing) - I knew that would get him. (Laughs) - What? - Well, where we going? Fucking Fergus. What are you doing in there? You're not going anywhere, Fergus. What's the problem, man? May as well. Oh. Yeah, right. Faggus. In the dunes? Man, have you seen his get-up? He doesn't wanna go. He's just bullshitting. (Andy) Yes, he does. What's your problem? He's your brother, man. Whatever. Just don't bloody tell Mum and Dad. Yeah, like I'm gonna say anything. You got fucking third? You whacking off? No! Nathan stuffed me up. Billy's already giving me shit about Rip getting in over ya. Fuck Ripley, I'm better than he is. - Danny's a fucking dickhead. - Oh, Danny's a dickhead. You weren't even there, you fucking loser. What the fuck was that, you little shit? Fuck off. Fuck! Get off me! - Call me a fucking loser, huh? - Yeah, you're a fucking loser. We're gonna play a little game of fucking Jesse typewriter. - J-E, double-S.

Grow up! - You want me to go already? - Fucking go, huh? - Go downstairs and chill out! Go on. - You all right? - Yeah. Go downstairs and help your mother. - Go to your mummy, third-place pussy. - Victor! And Jess, pull your pants up. For God's sake! (Slams door) What have you got so much stuff for? I got Dad coming over and all youse ever do is eat everything up. Got some of them nice meat pies you like. I'm going to Scotty's for the weekend. - For the weekend? - Yeah. The surf's gonna be heaps good. No. I don't want you sponging off them like that. I'm not sponging off them. Scotty invited me and Fergus. - What you up to? - Nothing. You're taking Fergus to Scotty's for the weekend? - Yeah, so? - What's going on? Nothing. I'm going over to Scotty's for the weekend with Fergus. Mum! Just making sure there ain't no funny business going on. You know Mum's making dinner tonight? Yeah, I know, I forgot. But it's Scotty's birthday. (Sighs) No answer. Do you know about this? - What? - (Flora) This weekend. (Whispers) Yes. Yeah, er... I already told you guys. Scotty invited us at the pool. - Right. To his house. - (Jesse) Yeah. We're gonna teach Fag...erm, Fergus how to surf. - Who's "we"? - Everyone. Like Nathan, Scotty, Andy. - And whose idea was this? - Well... - Gramps. - Yeah, Gramps. - You wanna go? - Yeah. - Got a new pair of boardshorts. - With what money? Mowing lawns. Yeah, cool. So we can go? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. How'd you go today, anyway? He blew it. Shit! (Reggie) Oh, great! (Flora) Bit of paint, you'll never know. Nathan doubled up on Jesse's wave, got his best ride disqualified. So he came in third and they're only giving out two spots this year, so... Oh. You behave yourself over there. I don't want his mum calling me with no stories. No. She won't. She won't. (Car engine revving) (Kids cheering) (Leah) Can you slow down? (Scotty) No, go faster! (All groan) - Oh, spit it out. - Don't get it on me! (Scotty) Oh! That's classic! (Andy) You all right, man? (Laughs) Oh, yuck. (Jesse) Oh, that's wrong! - (Fergus groans) - (Jesse) Damn!

(Scotty) Fuck off, Fergus! # I went to the beach just the other day # # I saw some skin-coloured nutties yeah, yeah, yeah # # What did I say? What did I do? Skin-coloured undies ride to you # - Lovely. - Oi, he's so... Oi, what did you say the other day? Remember he said something? Oh, yeah, he said something. I don't think he's got the guts to say it now. You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't do it. (Jesse burps) (Groaning, laughter) (Jesse) Want some? (Indistinct) Want some? Nate? What the hell are you guys laughing about? Don't worry, man. You wouldn't understand. (Debra) What are they? (Nathan) Fergus, try this. - (Andy) S'mores. - Do it. Do it.

These s'mores are good. They're real good. Good, yeah. (Choking) This is gnarly, man! Oh, fucking real. (Laughter continues) (Fergus chokes) - Wait. Wait. - (Laughter continues) - Hey. Debra. - Shh! Wait. And here's to Andy. The next Pro Junior Champ, eh? There's a lot of guys I gotta beat before that happens. - Ripley for one. - Ripley?! I like the guy, but fuck. Ripley, man? You could piss all over Ripley, dude. You, Andy. You're a world champion, mate. (Nathan scoffs) (Scotty) Shut the fuck up. He is! (Andy) Scotty. - (Scotty) Don't youse reckon? - Scotty! He's never gonna be world champion. He doesn't want it. - What, like you, you mean? - Fucking oath. Yeah, look, Jess, mate. Get over it, hey? There's more to life. If you'd didn't fuck me up I'd be halfway there already. Look, we're all having a good time here, don't ruin it. I don't want to mess up your perfect life. - What? - (Debra) Jesse! - I got no one paying my way, do I? - You don't fucking know anything, Jess! - Go fuck yourself, Nathan. - You dudes! Don't go there. It's not about all that shit. I don't have a dad who's an agent either, do I, Andy? Dude. You guys get whatever you want for doing nothing. - Jesse, just chill out. - Fuck off, Fergus. Great, Jesse, yeah. You're better than all your friends, you don't need anyone, and you're going to be world champ, great, we all agree. OK? Yeah, well, we all know why you're here, don't we, Faggus? I mean, what?

I'm just sick of their shit. You know, I'm as good as Andy is. - Jesse, come on. - I'm gonna make the tour. Shut up. Looks like a face. Er...you mean the saucepan? Yeah. Looks like one of those faces Picasso paints, doesn't it? See? The eyes, the nose, and those stars over there look like a mouth. - What, you know who Picasso is? - (Laughs) Yeah, I'm not an idiot. It's just that when I tell people it looks like a face, they just think I'm weird. - Well, you are. - What do you mean? (Laughs) I'm just messing with ya. It'd be cool to know what all those stars were, though. - You know, like... - Astronomy? Yeah. I'm into that stuff. Me too. Hey, check this out. (Andy) That's weird. Looks like we're looking down. Yeah. Something about the angle. # Is there a place where I can go # # Where the stories all unfold... # Can I start again? (All laugh) Shut up, dickhead. This is what he does, oi, this is what he does every time. - Shut up. - It is! - Shut up! - Give me that. - Give me that. - No chance. I'm playing, OK? Are you ready? # And you know # # Yeah, you know # # It's a lonely road # # And I swear # # Every story has a turning point # # Every journey has some roads way out of joint # - (Mouths lyrics) - # Every battle has a setting sun # # And even stars they only burn so long # # And then they're gone # It's kind of...kind of John Mayer but a little bit different. We've sort of got our own sound. I liked it. Yeah? Yeah, well, I wrote the words, so... Fuck it. (Sighs) See? We're just like all them stars. Little specks of nothing. Random dots lighting up the sky. - I loved it. - Yeah? You, er, ready for the comp next weekend? I so don't care about any of that stuff. Really? Really. My dad's all about it. He's a surf agent. Well, that's good. Isn't it? Yeah, if you want an agent. I mean... ..he sends me shit. He keeps saying this is the year that he's going to move back. He never does. I know he won't. I don't care if you look at me, Fergus. - Oh, I was just... - It's no big deal, mate. (Fergus sighs) (Giggling) Sorry. (Both laugh) (Scotty) Hey, Nate! (Giggling) Should have known. Should have known! Yeah. # Oh, I don't want no complication # # I don't need no obligation # Do you want to? - I don't know. - Come on. I do, but... I really like you, Deb. I mean that. I really do. Right. Do you have a condom? Oh, shit, no. Do you? - No. - Fuck. I'll pull out. - Jesse... - Come on, I promise. OK. - There? - You're too high. Wait. Down. Ow. Wait. Oh! Oh! Oh, shit, yeah.

Not really, I guess. You jerk off? What? (Laughs) No! Shit. I do it all the time. Well, yeah. I do. A lot. (Both laugh) (Fergus) From time to time. So you want to now? What?! Are you serious? - (Debra) You didn't pull out. - Yeah, I did. - No, you didn't. - I didn't come much. You're kidding, right? (Nathan moans) (Climaxes) (Both laugh) - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah, Nate Dog, you animal! - Fuck off! - (Engine starts) Who the fuck's in my mum's truck? (Revving) - (Debra) Stop, make it stop! - Oh, shit!

They're not gonna see it like that. (Jesse) Fuck 'em. - You guys aren't supposed to be out here. - Yeah, right. So? - What's Fergus doing with ya? - He wanted to come. He doesn't belong out here. - You're still hanging with that Andy kid? - Yeah, what of it? I can see why he's on the Pro Junior. Too bad you're not. Fuck off, Victor. Fuck it! Man, that kid's all right, eh? Fuck that. Ain't as good as Ripley. Yeah, you hope, brother. Oi, look out! I'm glad we're not out there. (Coughs) You fuckwit! (Nathan) Yeah. You're a fucking idiot!

Fucking breathe! - Come on, Jesse! - (Leah) Come on, Andy, breathe! - (Fergus) Come on, Victor! - Fucking hell! (Squeals) Yeah, that's it. Come on, Andy, breathe. Breathe! Come on! Come on, Victor! Come on! Pump harder, Fergus! Shit! Fucking pump his chest, Fergus! Fergus, pump his chest! Come on, Victor, breathe! (Sobs) Come on! (Door opening) It wasn't his fault! It wasn't his fault. (Door slams upstairs) (Baby crying) You OK? What? Nothing. I mean, just not now. - You're really special to me, Deb. - Jesse... - I like you, but... - But what? I mean... You don't want to be with me? Let's just not talk about it now. So none of that meant anything to you? We had a weekend. Are you pregnant? No. Fuck it. No, Jesse, wait. (Nathan) So can you, like, feel anything? (Andy) Yeah, a little bit. It kinda hurts but, you know, not really. It feels like everything's there, but not. You know? But they said you're gonna be OK? Yeah, a couple of weeks, maybe a month, I'll be up for a wave. (Scotty) Yeah. No comp though, huh? No. Jesse! I'm just worried about him, that's all. He hasn't even been surfing. You're not the only one worried about him. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Just get away! Get away! - Just get away! - Jesse! (Door slams) (Sobs) (Fergus) Mum? - Dad? - Fergus! (Reggie sobbing) (Man) Oi! You're gonna need this. What for? Well, you came in third. Andy's hurt pretty bad, so you're next in line. You up for it? I ca... Danny, I can't take it. Sign-in's at eight. Can't change it now. Just do your best, all right? If you don't make it... ..everyone'll understand. Nice board, mate. Look, Andy, I'm really sorry, man. It's not your fault. - Yeah, it is. - Shut up. Dude, I shouldn't have dropped in on your wave. I shouldn't have... Shut up, all right? You're in the contest now. This is what you've always wanted. - Shit, mate, I... - Don't worry about me. Andy, it's not... I don't know, it's just not important any more. - Really? - Yeah, really. I mean, all that was Victor's dream. And what's yours, mate? I know the feeling. Ah! Careful. (Phone rings) Hello? This is what we need. So this is what you guys do when Fergus comes around? Sometimes. Figures. What? I'm always trying to nick 'em and you just give 'em to him. Well, he's not so dumb, is he? Guess not. You know, life sometimes is a real shit, buddy. It's a real shit. You've got to stop blaming yourself. It was an accident. You didn't mean to hurt anyone. (Jesse sniffing) But I did, Gramps. Jess. (Fergus) Gramps? Gramps? (Fergus) Hey! (Panting) I ain't surfing the contest. That's all right. What's the fucking point? I don't know. (Jesse) I'm so over it. When we were eight, Victor told me I couldn't go surfing because I had glasses, and I believed him. Then when he told me I didn't fit in with you any more, and your friends, I figured he was right. Fergus, he was just... But when he told me that I couldn't play guitar, and that I'd never be any good at anything... I stopped listening to him. He was just hassling you, man. Yeah, I know. He was mad. His mum died and we came and took his dad away. He just took it out on me. He gave me shit, too. Yeah, after he busted his knee, 'cause he knew that you were gonna go places that he couldn't go any more. - What, like he was jealous? - Yeah. He was lonely. You still do that? Yeah. Best thing you ever showed me. Jesse? Jesse! Oi! Jesse! Whoo! Come on! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Come on! Whoo! Come on! It's great. Whoo! (Fergus continues whooping) Come on! (Cheers) (Wolf whistle) - Shit! - Oh, fuck. (Jesse) Fuck. OK, wait here. (Whispers) Come on. (Lifeguard) Hey! (Jesse) Run! Get off my friggin' beach! Go on, go and get some clothes on! Go on, get goin'! Get out of here. Go on! What do you think it is? Get out of here! (Both laughing) - Pumping, isn't it? - Where have you been? (Indistinct chatter) - (Jesse) Here you go. - Get the... (Dog barking) (Blender) Urgh! Gramps. (Floorboards creaking) (Gramps) Been for a swim? - Yeah. - Hi, Gramps. What the hell happened to your clothes? - What are you doing here? - Hm! - You got a contest to go, don't ya? - Yeah. (Laughter) - (Sandra) Good luck, boys. - Eyes. All right, sweetheart. Yeah, Jesse! (All cheer) Go on, Jesse. Wow! (Cheering) (Whooping) - Whoo-hoo! - Yay, Jess! Andrew! (PA commentary) (Commentator) Mitch Rusedski and Jesse Hoff. Three locals take on the surfer... (Commentator) ..up on the inside, a couple of big moves. - Great wave. - (Commentator) Jesse Hoff. Oh, no! Ooh! (Woman shouting) - Oh, sorry. - Watch the contest. Definitely intensive. - Not bad. - For a bum out. (Commentator) Jesse Hoff has the whole line-up to himself. Come on, Jess. (Foghorn) (Crowd cheering, whooping) Come on, already! (Flora) Coming! (Jesse) Oi, tell your boyfriend to hurry up! (Fergus) Shut up! (Andy) What did he say? (Fergus) Nothing. (Jesse) Oi! Wankers!
