You'll have to wait. - I could use a little dinner. - Fix him up in the kitchen, Tom. Right this way. You ain't paid for your drink, mister. Now, friend, don't rush the night. I may be around a while. Take good care o' these. That's a lot of man you're carrying in those boots. There's something about a tall man makes people sit up and take notice. It's a Johnny Guitar. Says he has an appointment with you. I'll see him later. - Sam, light a lamp and hang it outside. - Nobody'll be in in this weather. If they do, how can they find the place? Just hang a lamp. Never seen a woman who was more a man. She thinks like one, acts like one, and sometimes makes me feel like I'm not. Eddie, that's last month's paper. How many times do you have to read it? I like to know what's happening in the world outside. There'll be plenty going on here soon. Just worry about that. I never believed I'd end my years working for a woman and likin' it. - Spin the wheel, Eddie. - What for? No customers. I like to hear it spinning. Please sit down. - More wine, Mr. Andrews? - No, I'd better get back to my crew. We've a good deal of mountain to blast through. But you have to wait till the storm settles. Tell me, why did you pick this spot to build? How could you possibly know that the railroad was coming this way? Some time ago, I ran into your surveyor and we exchanged confidences. Ah. When the railroad comes through, how much will this property be worth? - What's Albuquerque worth? - How would you like to share in it? I'll need all the help I can get. I couldn't help you. I'm not handy with a gun. I'm offering you an opportunity to get rich. An opportunity to get killed would be more accurate. I see you've been influenced by my friends. They're determined people. Too determined for my tastes. But I wish you luck, Vienna. For whatever it's worth. Thanks, Mr. Andrews, but I'm not trusting to luck. A good gunfighter doesn't depend on four-leafed clovers. And I think I... - Expecting company? - Not for dinner. Woah! Keep the wheel spinning, Eddie. Come on down, Vienna. Take a good look, Vienna. I'm sorry, Emma. Your brother was a very fine man. How would you know? He was one man who never even looked at you. He was still a fine man. We want the Dancin' Kid and his bunch. They don't live here. You're one o' them. - Wait. - We don't need you, Marshal. We got enough trouble, Vienna. Don't give us none. The only trouble we have is what you've brought in. - Jenks. - Yes, Mr. McIvers. You were driving the stagecoach. You saw the killin'. Who did it? - Answer the question. - There was four of 'em. - I didn't ask how many. I asked who. - The sun was in my eyes. A while ago, you said it was the Dancin' Kid. Say it now. You said it was the Kid. I only said it could have been. - Any more witnesses, Marshal? - We don't need any more witnesses. We're taking you and your men into custody. Eddie, you can stop spinning the wheel. Come and get me, Mr. McIvers. - We don't want no shooting, Vienna. - I'm not coming peaceably, Marshal. Look, this is a hanging matter. We can't go arresting people without proof. If the Kid was here, you'd want proof? The Kid and Vienna aren't the same. I say they are. They both cast the same shadow. Someone holds up the stagecoach, your brother is killed and all you can think about is hanging the Dancin' Kid. You know he didn't do it. You all know it. - What's your real reason, Emma? - Cos he's a killer. What has he killed? Why do you hate him so? What did he ever do to you? Maybe you don't hate him. You got something to say, you'd better say it, Vienna. - Let Emma say it. - I wouldn't spit on him. Oh, he was always eyeing me. I never told my poor brother because Len would have killed him. That's why he held up the stage and killed my brother. Now he thinks he can get me. That's why. You've got it a little twisted, haven't you, Emma? - Now you think you can get him. - She's crazy. You want the Kid and you're so ashamed of it, you want him dead. You want me dead, too. Then maybe you can sleep nights. I won't sleep till I see both of you hanged. You and the Kid and all of your filthy kind. Look at her. Standing up there, staring down on us, like a somebody. Go get her! Drag her down! I've never done a thing to hurt any of you. Don't make me do it now. You're a railroad tramp. You're not fit to live among decent people. Get out of here while you can, you and your men. We're here to stay, Mr. McIvers, you'd better get used to that idea. - We don't want you here. - This was free country when I came. - I'm not giving up a single foot of it. - You don't hear so good. - We don't want you here. - You don't own the earth, not this part of it. Stay and you'll keep only enough of it to bury you in. I intend to be buried here... in the 20th century. You'll never see a train run through. Now you said it. It took a long time for the truth to come out, didn't it? You and McIvers own the whole town and every head of beef within 500 miles. But that isn't enough, is it? You've got to own everything. You can't stand to see anybody else live. Well, you're going to. You're going to see a whole new town right where you're standing. A town you don't own. The railroad's sending in people by tens, twenties, hundreds and thousands. You can't keep them all out! - Tell them, Mr. Andrews. - I think you put it rather well. You're not building no depot here. That's for Vienna to decide. Vienna decided. Now get out! Get out, all of you! That's big talk for a little gun. You can't shoot all of us. Two of you will do. You don't have the nerve. Try me. Stop pushing, Emma. Put down that gun, Vienna. Put down the gun. Down there I sell whiskey and cards. All you can buy up these stairs is a bullet in the head. Now, which do you want? All right. Break it up here, men. Break it up. I'm going to kill you. I know. If I don't kill you first. You wanted the Dancin' Kid, Marshal. Here he comes. Could you spare that smoke, friend? Trouble you for a light, friend. There's nothing like a good smoke and a cup of coffee. You know, some men got the cravin' for gold and silver, others need lots o' land with herds o' cattle and there's those that got the weakness for whiskey and for women. When you boil it all down, what does a man really need? Just a smoke and a cup o' coffee. - And who are you? - The name, sir, is Johnny Guitar. - That's no name. - Anybody care to change it? I hired you to play the guitar, not insult my customers. Well, if these are your customers, I'm not so sure I'll take this job. That's pretty strong talk for a man who doesn't wear a gun. It's also bad manners. You must be the Dancin' Kid. That's the name, friend. Care to change it? No. No, I like it. - Can you dance? - Can you play? I'm sorry, Emma. Where you boys been this afternoon? - How does that concern you? - Relax, Bart. Marshal's only trying to do his duty. I'm still asking. Where were we this afternoon, Corey? Same place we are every day. - Working in our silver mine. - What mine? - You got a silver mine, nobody ever saw it. - Where do you think we get our money? Stealing. Killing honest folks that work for theirs. That's harsh talk, Mr. McIvers. You boys don't ranch, you don't farm. Still, you always got plenty of money. I told you, we got a silver mine. Maybe you better show us that silver mine. Huh! And have every man within 500 miles stamping on our necks? What is this? We just did a day's work, we came for a few drinks and cards, like every Friday, isn't that so, Vienna? - They never miss a Friday. - She's lying, that tramp. Anyone else think I'm lying? She's one o' them. I say string them all up. All of them! Me too, Emma? Jenks, how many men held up that stage? - I think there was four. - Come here, Jenks. What for? Take a good look at these men. Do you recognize any of them? I told you, the sun was in my eyes. You got me and a dozen men behind you. Don't be afraid to tell the truth. I ain't afraid, Mr. McIvers. I said they wore masks. How could I recognize anybody? You, come here. I got a name, mister. - I said come here. - Well, say it nice. Don't start anything, go talk to him. - Where are you from? - Albuquerque. - You come over the trail this afternoon? - Uh-huh. - You see anything? - Yeah. - Yeah, I saw the stage being held up. - What? From the mountains, couldn't make out any details. Why didn't you ride down and help 'em? With what, this? - Where are your guns? - I don't wear any. Maybe you got rid of them after the shooting. - You have a suspicious mind, mister. - How come you don't go armed? Because I'm not the fastest draw west of the Pecos. They're laughing at you. Is that what you came here for, to be laughed at? Now listen, everybody. Listen good, cos I'm only gonna say this once. In 24 hours - mark it, 24 hours - this is gonna be closed territory. We got a saloon in town. We don't need one out here. I'm passing a law against gambling and drinking outside the town limits. That law goes into effect in 24 hours. That's all. Well, it was nice meeting you all. You don't own this whole territory, McIvers. - You got no call, asking us to leave. - I'm not asking, I'm telling you. - Supposing we don't? - You got 24 hours. He can't make his own laws. Tell him, Marshal. - Mac, you know we can't pass a law... - 24 hours. - Just a minute, Mac. - Don't cross me, Marshal. I give these people fair warning. If they don't pull out, I suggest you go fishing till it's all over. Sounds like the storm's all over, boys. - Let's go. - Mr. McIvers, I believe you owe me for one bottle of whiskey. I don't want to owe you anything. Don't you ever forget that, Mr. McIvers. Come on, Emma. And when they go, you better go with 'em. Ya! Want me to help you pack? I threw away my trunk when I came here. McIvers has over 30 guns riding for him. What are you gonna hold him off with? The guitar? - Mr. Guitar? - Yes, ma'am? Still want the job? Well, a man's gotta plant roots somewhere. This seems like a nice, quiet place. Friendly, too. I like him. I like you, mister. Maybe you'd care to work for me. Just what is your business, sir? I'll find one. All you have to do is play that guitar for me. - I like the first offer better. - It's better you work for me. - Let Mr. Guitar make up his own mind. - All of a sudden, I don't like you, mister. Now that makes me real sad. I always hate to lose a friend. That's the way it goes. Lose one, find one. Play something for me, Mr. Guitar. Anything special? Just put a lot of love in it. He ain't gonna play so good, all stretched out on that crap table. What's eating the fancy man? - I don't know. What's your trouble, Kid? - I'm in no trouble, he is. Fooling with a strange woman can bring a man a lot of grief. - You a strange woman? - Only to strangers. What's going on with you two? Just what you see, friend. Oh, you picked the wrong place to come to, mister. The lady sent for me, not you. Heads, I'm gonna kill you, mister. Tails, you can play her a tune. Play me a tune. Play something else. Play what you was playing before. The lady didn't like the tune. A troublemaker. - You want something? - Yeah. I wanna study you some more. Have a drink. - Thank you. - Don't go. - Have another. - No thanks. - Yes, thanks. - I said no, thanks. I'm setting 'em up, all you gotta do is drink 'em. Maybe... maybe he don't like your company, Bart. Yeah? I guess Bart's man's fussy who he drinks with. Your health, gentlemen. - Have one more. - I thank you kindly, mister, I had enough. I'll say when's enough. Empty it. That one slipped. When a man can't hold onto a glass, he should drink like a baby, from a bottle. Open your mouth, guitar man, I'll feed you. Want me to stop it? I don't think so. Not just yet. I said open your mouth, guitar man. Outside, please. Bart, leave your guns. Seems I've lost some of my charm. All of it. I always wanted to shoot me a guitar man. That's a worthy ambition. What's the matter with me? Tell me. - What d'you see you don't like? - Nothing. As a matter of fact, I like you. But not enough, huh? Not that much. - I remember different. - You remember, I don't. That's the way it goes. If you're smart, you'll ride out of here and keep on riding and you won't come back. That's what I should do but I never do what I should. Well, it's your funeral. Don't bury me yet. Put him on his horse. You made a big mistake, mister. Bart's not a man to forget. He'll be getting back at you. Thanks, Vienna, for a real nice time. Vienna? Yes, Turkey. You know, after what happened today, I don't guess we'll be seeing you any more. I'm sure gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you a lot, Turkey. You know, you've been about my only friend. If you're gonna stay here, you're gonna need somebody to, sort of, look after you. So, I'm staying with you. If you look after me, who's going to look after you? You talk like I was a boy. I'm a man. Every man's entitled to be a boy for a little while. - You were cheated, Turkey. - I'll prove to you I'm a man. That was good shooting, Turkey, for a boy. Give me that gun. You're still gun crazy, aren't you? No. I... I thought the youngster was trying to shoot up the place. Frank, Eddie and Sam didn't think so. - I acted a little hasty. - If I hadn't stepped in front of Turkey, you would have shot him. - Where are your guns? - In my saddlebag. Suppose you leave them there. I'll tell you when to use them. You're the boss. You haven't changed at all, Johnny. What made you think I had? In five years, a person should learn something. Five years ago, I met you in a saloon. Now I find you in one. - I don't see much change. - Except I own this one. Come here for a minute. Do you know what this is? Looks like a lot of towns I've been in. This town will be here next year. You can own part of it. Share and share alike with Frank, Tom, Eddie and Sam. - Why me? - Maybe I'll need a gunfighter. Albuquerque's lousy with gunfighters. But I sent for Johnny Logan. I don't use that name any more. So you changed your name and thought that would change everything. - You hired me to do a job. - Is that all you came here for, - to do a job? - No. No, I wanted to see you again. Heard you had a little luck. Luck had nothing to do with it. I was being polite. I'm not ashamed of how I got what I have. The important thing is, I've got it. - That's the way most people look at it. - Except you? - What right have you to judge? - I once loved you. A man takes a pride in something he really cares for. - He hates to see it trampled. - A man can lie, steal and even kill, but as long as he hangs on to his pride, he's still a man. All a woman has to do is slip once and she's a tramp. Must be a great comfort to you to be a man. It was more of a comfort to think that you were waiting for me. Did you honestly believe, after five years, I'd be waiting for you? Well, I had a long ride up here from Albuquerque. I had to think of something. But it was nice to know that we'd be together again. Well, that's very generous of you, Mr. Logan. - Is that a proposal? - A man's gotta stop somewhere. This seems as good a spot as any. That's just about the most touching speech a woman ever listened to. I'm overwhelmed. Maybe it's rushing it a little but... that's the general idea, isn't it? No, Mr. Logan. That isn't my idea at all. - Suppose you tell me. - Oh, it's a sad story. I listen good to sad stories. Five years ago, I loved a man. He wasn't good, he wasn't bad but... I loved him. I wanted to marry him, to work with him. To build something for the future. They should have lived happily ever after. They didn't. They broke up. He couldn't see himself being tied down to a home. Looks like she was smart, getting rid of him. She was smart, all right. She learned not to love anybody again. Five years is a long time. There must have been quite a few men in between. Enough. What do you suppose would happen if he was to come back? When a fire burns itself out, all you have left is ashes. I'll do that. Thank you. Why us? Why every time, us? Try and figure out who held up the stage. There's a hundred gangs hiding in Mexico. They hit and run and we get the blame. We got more than the blame this time. McIvers says we got 24 hours to get. In case any of you just remember. Our silver mine's all played out. It wasn't much to begin with. We might as well pull out. - What d'you say, Corey? - The Kid'll tell us what to do. - I asked you your opinion, Mr. Corey. - I told you... The Kid'll do the telling, Mr. Lonergan. Seems like he has other things on his mind. - Meaning what? - Vienna. You're still soft on her. That's what's keeping us all here. - You wanna go, go. - Can't stay without a fight. McIvers don't make small talk. - It seems you lost your taste for fighting. - Depends on what I'm fighting for. Sit down. And no woman's worth it. You really think so, uh? I've known plenty. They're all the same. No good. - You and Emma would make a fine couple. - Yeah. What d'you mean? Bart, you don't drink, you don't smoke. You're mean to horses. What do you like? Me. I like me. And I'm taking good care o' me. Maybe you're right, Bart. This dust and sand is bad for Corey's lungs. Here. How'd you like to come home with me, Corey? - Where's your home? - New York. New York? I've been there. Stinks of fish. And where you come from don't stink... much. Let's decide. We've gotta go some place. - I know of a place... - I just decided. We're going to California. - The horses won't last. - We'll buy fresh horses on the way. Did I hear you say buy? That's right. Only idiots steal horses. With what are we gonna buy these fresh horses? With gold, Mr. Lonergan. With gold. We haven't any gold. We hardly got enough silver to plug up the holes in Bart's teeth. We stay around here, we'll wind up hanging. I hate to be run out for something we didn't do. So let's do something. Something they can hang us for. Mm, that's only justice, ain't it? Sounds like justice to me. Having fun, Mr. Logan? I couldn't sleep. That stuff help any? It makes the night go faster. What's keeping you awake? Dreams. Bad dreams. Yeah, I get 'em sometimes, too. Here, this'll chase 'em away. I tried that. Didn't seem to help me any. How many men have you forgotten? As many women as you've remembered. Don't go away. I haven't moved. Tell me something nice. Sure. What d'you want to hear? Lie to me. Tell me all these years you've waited. Tell me. All these years I've waited. Tell me you'd have died if I hadn't come back. I would have died if you hadn't come back. Tell me you still love me like I love you. I still love you like you love me. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Stop feeling so sorry for yourself. You think you had it rough. I didn't find this place, I had to build it. - How do you think I was able to do that? - I don't wanna know. But I want you to know. For every board, plank and beam in this place... I heard enough. No, you're going to listen. I told you. I don't wanna know any more. You can't shut me up, Johnny. Not any more. Once I would have crawled at your feet to be near you. I searched for you in every man I met. Look, Vienna, you just said you had a bad dream. We both had, but it's all over. - Not for me. - It's just like it was five years ago. Nothing's happened in between. - Oh, I wish... - Not a thing. You've got nothing to tell me cos it's not real. Only you and me. That's real. We're having a drink at the bar in the Aurora Hotel. The band is playing, we're getting married. And after the wedding, we're going away. So laugh and be happy. It's your wedding day. I have waited for you, Johnny. Oh, what took you so long? - Good morning. - Good morning. Well, what are we waiting for? - Where are we going? - To town. Like the man said - all a fella needs is a cup of coffee and a good smoke. Up-ho. - Bank's closed, Vienna. - Why? It's no holiday. There all down at the cemetery for Mr. Small's funeral. That still doesn't make it a holiday. It's ten o'clock Saturday morning and I want my money. - Wait here. - Mm-hm. I guess we can accommodate you, Vienna. Thank you, Ned. Why are you closing your account? Now that Len's gone, I'm not doing business with Emma. Do you want it in gold or notes? Notes will do. No one else, Jake. - Bank's closed. - I wanna make a deposit. - Come back in an hour. - Can I leave this here? I don't wanna carry it around. Hand it over. Stay where we can see you, Ned. So I got me a front-row seat at the show, huh? Want to be a hero or stay alive? I got a lot of respect for a gun. Besides, I'm a stranger here myself. Unhitch the horses and keep him covered. Help Corey! - Got a gun? - No, not this morning. You didn't tell 'em what happened, eh? You picked a bad time to do business, Vienna. You must be crazy. Now they will hang the stage killing on your neck. Call your men off and get out, no one will know. Ned, tell him you'll forget about it. I promise you, Kid, no one'll know. But I want 'em to know and to remember. I'm gonna leave this town so broke, they'll never forget the Dancin' Kid. Emma will never let you get away with it. You don't know her, I do. Hurry it up in there. That funeral ain't gonna last all day. Listen to me. So far, you've done nothing wrong. You heard McIvers, we gotta go. But we ain't going empty-handed. He told me to go, too. But I'm staying. Give this up and you won't have to go. And what have I got to stay for? - What would make you give this up? - You. And if I give this up, could I hold on to you? For how long? - Sorry, Kid. - What's taking you two so long? - You can't stop me, Vienna. - I'm going to. - Don't try. - You'll have to shoot. I will. Keep 'em up, Ned, high. Don't push me, Vienna. Time's up, let's go. - Bart! - I was gonna wing him so he can't follow. Yeah, I know. He's not going to follow. Yee-ha! - Now where to? - Let's go home. Come on. Was I dreaming or did I just see a bank held up? The Kid's no bank robber. McIvers forced his hand by giving him 24 hours. McIvers didn't give him a gun and take him to the bank. That was the Kid's idea. I tried to stop him. Who's going to believe that? Don't you? - What I think doesn't matter. - It does to me. What are you thinking? You and the Kid, at the bank at the same time, that don't look good. He didn't take your money, did he? No, he didn't. This is all Emma needs. - Why does she hate you so? - She's in love with the Kid. Last night, she tried to get him hung. He makes her feel like a woman and that frightens her. By now, Emma's worked up and she's started on the others. - We've gotta get out fast. - Where? We can't worry about that now. We'll keep going until we're out of the valley. I still want to go home. It's a rough climb over those mountains. It's the only way out. We'd go faster through the desert. Look, Corey, once we're into it, the closest water hole is 400 miles. I'm not chancing it. Maybe we oughta split the money and separate. We're riding together. What about it, Corey? We're riding together. So let's go! They took it all. All of it. - The Kid and his bunch. - And Vienna. - No. Vienna tried to stop him. - She's one o' them. - No, she wasn't. - She was here, wasn't she? - Yes, but... - Jake, Vienna got you to unlock the door, didn't she? - Yeah, but they came later. - How much later? A minute? They planned this thing from the very beginning, together. You come with me, Jake. We're gonna bring every cent of it back. And Vienna was one of them. Understand? Well, I did see him kiss her. Here. Take a gun. - We won't need you, Emma. - I'm coming. - You'll be in the way. - I'm going after my money. They got my money, too. He's right. You'll slow us up. I'm riding with you. And I'll be riding first. Ha. Hey you! They're closing the pass. If you're thinking of running, it's a little late. I've got a hunch the posse will be dropping in on you before night. Same people who paid you a visit yesterday, only they won't be the same. A posse isn't people. I've ridden with 'em and against 'em. A posse is an animal. It moves like one and thinks like one. They're men with itchy fingers and a coil of rope, looking for somebody to hang. And after riding a few hours, they don't care much who they hang. You haven't told me a thing I don't know. - I haven't finished. - Finish but be brief. A posse feels safe because it's big. They only make a big target. I can ride around and pick off a few. The rest of 'em'll lose their guts, turn tail, break up and go home. I hired you for protection. - I won't have any killing. - What do you think they'll do to you? Make up your mind. To stay is to fight. I'm going to stay. I'm going to fight but I won't kill. To fight, you've got to kill. I don't know any other way. You are gun crazy. You'll never be any different. It was a mistake to send for you, Johnny. You can pick up your pay, now. Ha! You and your smart ideas! Ha! Ha! I'm all right. Help me on my horse. We're not gonna get through that. - Is there another pass? - No. - If we ditch the horses. - We'll never make it. We'll have to try the desert. We can't stay here. - We'll go back to the lair. - What? We'll be safe. We can't get out, but they can't get in. - It's like walking into a trap. - What's your ideas? - I said we should have taken a desert route. - That was before. I'm asking now. Ya! Treat, you and your men cover the desert trail. The rest of you boys, come with me. You each have enough money to stake you for six months, wherever you go. If I'm still here by then, I'll expect you back. You'll each have a share, like I promised. If I'm not here, just keep wheeling and dealing. The 24 hours aren't up yet. If you run into the posse, they'll let you through. - You'd better get started. - Good luck, Vienna. See you, Vienna. Eddie. This is for Tom. Find him and take him with you. Mr. Logan. That's for your trouble. Vienna's is closed, Mr. Logan. - Where's Turkey? - He was right behind me at the bridge. Then he's somewhere between here and Vienna's. Come on. - Turkey musta passed out. Let's go back. - We can't. - We gotta find him before they do. - These woods'll be full. Let's get inside. - We go back, they'll cut us off from the lair. - How does that help Turkey? - He took his chances. - Kid, it could have been any of us. He's better off alone. You two go in, I'll look for him. - You're coming with us. - Take your hand off. You said we ride together, remember? Bart's right, Kid. We gotta stick together. Turkey'll have to make it back as best he can. I couldn't get through the mountains. That fancy engineer said Turkey got hurt trying. - Let's go to Vienna's. - Why should they go there? Hey, Pete. - We're wasting time. - You just can't push these men. Wait. We gotta get to Vienna's. - The men aren't ready yet. - Well, get 'em ready or let me do it. My men are not killers. They gotta be cold, tired and hungry before they get mad. - How long does that take? - You got five years o' mad in you. You can give them another five hours. No signs o' them in the desert. They've holed up, somewhere. - Probably in what they call their silver mine. - Anyone have an idea where the mine is? I watched 'em leave Vienna's following this creek. The camp's gotta be between Vienna's and Furnace Ridge, cos there's nothing beyond. If they got a camp up there, I'll find it. I've panned every inch of this stream. Let's go. - Wait a minute, boys, I got a better idea... - Wait. I'll say when and I'm not saying it yet. All right, Lou, you know this country better than anybody. We'll follow you. Come on. Wait a minute. Hey, someone's coming! Woah. Woah. Woah. - Hold that horse steady. - Hey, that's one of their horses. They never got where they were going. - One of 'em didn't make it. - Find him and you'd find 'em all. The only place between here and town is Vienna's. Reckon' maybe you been right all along, Emma. Of course I was right but you wouldn't listen. None of you. The last time either. There'd have been no bank hold-up, the stage wouldn't have been robbed, my brother wouldn't have been killed. I've been right about that woman ever since she came. I wanted to run her out before she ever got in but you wouldn't listen. None of you. The Marshal says he has to have legal cause. Mr. McIvers thinks he can do it with talk. And the rest of you can't make up your minds. Well, what are you waiting for? You heard her. They'll run the railroad through here, bring in thousands o' new people from the east. Farmers, dirt farmers. Squatters. They'll push us out. Is that what you're waitin' for? You're actin' like she's some fine lady. And doin' nothin' makes all of you fine gentlemen. Well, she ain't and you're not. So you better wake up or you're gonna find you and your women and your kids squeezed between barbed wires and fence posts. Is that what you're waiting for? Well, I'm not. One o' you boys better stay here. Clem, you stick around. Tom, why are you here? Why didn't you leave with the others? We've got a visitor. - You shouldn't have come back, Tom. - I won't be in the way. - I can't have anyone here. - Nobody notices me. I'm just part of the furniture. Why do you think I sent you away, all of you? What are you gonna do with him? - I can't keep him here. - Can't travel. Then I'll have to turn him over to the posse. But they'll hang him. He's just a boy. Boys who play with guns have to be ready to die like men. I'll hide him out in the cottonwoods. It's too late. You'll have to turn him over now. Help me. Help me, Vienna. - We came for the Kid and his bunch. - That's what you said yesterday. - We came for you, too, Vienna. - Why? I had nothing to do with robbing a bank. Every man here knows that. I don't have to hold up banks. All I have to do it sit here and wait for the railroad to come through. And that is my intention. What was your business at the bank this morning? If you remember, McIvers gave me 24 hours to close. I drew out my own money, paid off my boys and I'm closed. You can't buy a drink or turn a card. I'm sitting here in my own house, minding my own business, playing my own piano. I don't think you can make a crime out of that. Are you satisfied they're not here? No! I'm not satisfied. If they're not here, she knows where they are. - Ask her to tell you, Marshal. - How would she know? She and the Kid spent a lot of time together. They didn't spend all of it here. He's back in the lair. And she knows how to get there. Now ask her. - Vienna? - I can't help you, Marshal. - You mean, you won't. - I said I can't. - Either you side with them or with us. - I'm not taking sides with anyone. You can't stay on the fence no longer. It's not just Emma and McIvers. The men are fed up. Show us the way to the lair and save yourself a lot o' grief. I gave you my answer. Twice. We won't take that. And just what do you think I've been taking from you? Who are you... and you and you to break into my house with your angry faces and evil minds? Why do you come here? I knew you would. But why? I held up no stagecoach, I robbed no bank. But you're here again. I know, and I know you know, I'm innocent. Yet you stand there in your funeral clothes, like vultures, waiting for another corpse. Why, you miserable, you hypocritical... Where's the rest of the bunch? Where are they? You've got a rope around your neck, son, you'd better talk. It was Vienna's idea, wasn't it? Tell us. Don't be afraid. We'll protect you. I got a rope around my neck, how can you protect me? - Tell us the truth if you want a trial. - He's my prisoner, I'm taking him. We'll get the truth out of him first. Vienna got Jake to open the bank for you, didn't she? Come on, Turkey, tell us. I give you my word you won't hang. - Stop making promises you can't keep. - Stay out of this, Marshal. Just tell us Vienna was one of your bunch and we'll give you a chance. You might ride out of here. You're just a boy. - We don't want to hurt you. - The truth, son, that's all we want. Just tell us she was one of you, Turkey, and you'll go free. Better talk, boy. You'd better talk. What should I do? I don't wanna die. What do I do? Save yourself. What'll you do to her? The law will take its course. You don't have to say anything, just nod. Was Vienna one of you? Well, was she? - Ye... - He's a liar. You scared him into lying. You heard it from Turkey's own lips, men. What are you going to do now? - What do you say, Mr. McIvers? - Hang them! No! No. No, no, no. Let Mr. McIvers say it. All right. I'm for it. Her, too? Her, too. I'll shoot any man that steps up here. I'm taking Vienna and Turkey to town and I'm holding 'em for trial. You can take Turkey, Marshal, but not Vienna. Put that gun away, Tom. Not till you all get out of here. All of you! Why did you do it, Tom? You'd do the same for me. Look. Everybody's looking at me. It's the first time I ever felt important. You said I wouldn't die. You promised! You promised me I wouldn't die. You promised. Mr. McIvers, you promised. You said I wouldn't hang. You promised me! Ah! - Hurry it up, Jenks! - You wanna do it yourself? This isn't my idea, Vienna. Never mind the talk. Get it over with, Pete. What d'you say, Mr. McIvers? - Maybe we oughta... - Maybe we oughta what? - Nothing. - All right. I can't. Not a woman. It's up to you. Not me. I'll give 100 dollars! You'll have to do it yourself, Emma. Follow me. Why did you come back for me? First chance I ever had to be a hero. I couldn't pass it up. - Why did you bring... - There's a mine shaft there. It'll take us out on the other side. Taking you out of here in that dress is like carrying a lantern. - Vienna! - Johnny! This place looks pretty safe. Why can't we stay here? They know about this mine. When the fire burns down, they'll come looking. We'd better start thinking of another place. I have. But the Kid's there. Oh, that's why you brought us here. You and the Kid under the same roof? How long do you think you'd both be alive? - Which one are you worried about? - What's your guess? I only know what I saw. He didn't act like any stranger. - I never said he was. - Or even like a friend. - He was more. - Now tell me it was all one-sided. No. No, it wasn't. But I never lied to him. He knew there was someone else. There always would be... even if you hadn't come back. How do I make sure? If you're not sure by now, telling won't help. Better wait. They may double back this way. That's Turkey's horse. It's Vienna and Johnny Guitar! Tell him to put his hands high. - Where's the Kid? - In the cabin with Bart. Bart ain't gonna be happy to see you, mister. We're gonna die here, that's for sure. They'll find a way in. We'll have a chance to shoot our way out. Yeah. Some chance. If you don't like it here, you can take your cut and get. Oh, no. I'm sticking right with you. When I get it, you're gonna get yours, too. Keep talking, you're gonna get yours a lot sooner. Drop it. - How'd you get in? - Corey let us by. What d'you bring him for? There was a lynching last night. He saved my life. - Who'd they hang? - Turkey. Turkey? They hung Turkey. We could have gone back for him. Sure, and we'd all be hanging now. - You're wishin' it'd been me, uh? - You read me like a book. Will you stop it? You'll both get a chance to hang soon enough. Dry clothes in there. Turkey's. Vienna's a good shot. She'll come in handy when the shooting starts. - What good is he? - I'm not looking for trouble, Mr. Lonergan. Bart's the name. All my friends call me Bart. - Thank you, Mr. Lonergan. - Cut it out. We got enough trouble outside. Ain't it time you relieved Corey? - Yeah, it's time. - What are you waiting for? I wanna thank you for helping Vienna. - I didn't do it for you. - I didn't think you did. - Mind if I thank you anyway? - No, not at all. - You got dry clothes that I could put on? - In here. - What are you so happy about? - Why d'you let the stranger in? I couldn't risk a shot. There's posse all around. Besides, if Vienna brought him along, he must be all right. - He ain't all right with me. - Who is? Take it up with the Kid. I'm still riding behind him. Doors are made to knock on. I'm knocking. That's for Johnny boy, huh? What if it is? I don't like it. Why don't you tell him? I will. What are you gonna tell me, Kid? Well, look at Mr. Guitar. All dressed up and looking mighty dangerous. What did you wanna tell me? I'm too scared, now that you got a gun. - You'd better lay off him, Kid. - I wouldn't hurt him. I wasn't thinking of you hurting him. What, you mean he might, er, shoot himself in the leg, trying to draw? No. But if I were you, I wouldn't fool around with Johnny Logan. - Are you Johnny Logan? - That's the name, friend. Well... Pleased to meet you, Mr. Logan. I never shake hands with a left-handed draw. - Smart fella. - That's how I keep alive. We have to figure a way to get out of here. Let's try to work together just once. Anything for a friend. Could you spare a little breakfast? Sure, sure. Help yourself. You wouldn't shoot a man in the back? In front of Vienna? Why, she'd never forgive such bad manners. You'd better stick to your dancing, Kid. You'll live longer. No! No, Bart, don't shoot! I wanna talk to you! Come on in! Through the falls. Alone. Hold the men. I'm going in. I can handle Bart. Now, I was real fond of Turkey. He was a good boy. Hanging. Mm, that's a mean way to go. You couldn't have saved him, huh, Mr. Logan? - I had to make a choice. - Yeah. How'd Turkey take it? Hard? You ever know anyone to take a hanging easy? How did it feel with that rope round your neck, Vienna? Try it sometime. What was you thinking? - I don't know. - You must have been thinking something. - She don't wanna talk about it. - I'm asking her. Do you mind? - Got any eggs? - Top shelf. - Get them. - Let him get them. He's eating 'em. Crawling on that bridge and cutting that rope. That was real brave, Mr. Logan. How you gonna thank him, Vienna? - He hasn't asked for any thanks. - Yeah, but he expects plenty, don't you? - Sit down, Johnny. - Let him stand. Look at him, Vienna. Can't wait to shoot me. Finger's just itching on the trigger. Huh. Nice fella. You've finally got someone to do your killing for you. That oughta make you real happy. Sit down, Johnny. We've both done a lot of living. Our problem now is how to do a little more. - Anything? - No. Bart. Keep away from the guitar man. - Why? - His name is Johnny Logan. Just thought I'd tell you. You told me. - What's up? - Plenty. The posse's found a way in. - Relax. They're still outside. - Gotta keep 'em there. Listen. I just had a talk with Emma. She don't want us. - She wants Vienna and the guitar man. - How about the money? Listen. She'll settle for half and we get out of here into open country. - Did you tell the Kid? - No. - Why not? Why not? - If you listen, I'll tell you why not. He's stuck on Vienna. He won't turn her over. He'll put up a fight and get us all killed. - Now I got a better idea. - I don't like it. You don't like it? What don't you like? Are you crazy? I'm offering you a split and a chance to get out with a whole skin. I'm sticking with the Kid and you're gonna, too. You don't make sense, Corey. I don't like the sense you make. We ought to have a talk with the Kid right now. Some people just won't listen. Corey. Kid! That's it! Let's go! Ya! Lou, I'll tell you when there's to be any shooting! Looks like something's gone wrong, Emma. I'm coming up, Vienna! I'm waiting! Me and the boys had enough o' this killing. So have I. It's their fight. Has been all along. Run and tell the others there'll be no more shooting. Emma! No!
