He told me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny. - He didn't tell you about Pete? - No, who's Pete? Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day. He felt terrible cause he did some stuff he just couldn't get over. - What did he do? - He slept with five of his patients. But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe, because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't. The guilt and sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming. But every once in a while he hear a voice inside that said: "Pete, don't worry about it." You weren't the first licensed practitioner that sleeps with one of your patients and you won't be the last. Besides, you're single. Let it go. But then, just when he almost over the guilt with it all, another voice would bring him back down to reality. And say: "Oh Pete, But dude... You're a Veterinarian." Vi! Let's go! Wha..What are you doing? - I don't get it. - Don't get what? What's so funny about a vegetarian man? I don't get it. - You mean the Veterinarian man? - Yeah, that guy. I don't get it. He sleeps with his patients. His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff Why is that funny? Back home we've puppy dogs and kitty cats. I used to nap with all the time. I think it's sweet. Actually, don't worry about it partner, there are plenty of other jokes in the universe we can share. Let's just get ready for tonight. Some well deserved vacation. - I got a good one for you, Violet. - Lay it on me! Oh, damn! - What? - I think I forgot it. Well that's the good thing, Daze. I'll be here if it comes back to you Ten, Nine, Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One! What happened over there? Well... I was just thinkin' that, since how you're 18 and all and you can be charged as an adult now, for all felonies. Kid's meals, ferris wheels... God knows what else. I know. But hey, this should turn up for one around. I've invited Boss to our party. It was swell of you to invite him. Hello? Oh, hey Russ. Is that Russ calling to wishes a happy vacation because if it's not, he's got a wrong number. - Oh... - Jerk... I don't know. I've to check with Violet. - Vi? - No fucking way. - Violet says no. - Violet says "Fuck no". I thought you said we'd had some down time ahead. No, Violet told me you'd pull something like this! Oop yea, no kidding she said you'd do that too. Up the money and call it an easy gig. That's text book, Russ! What you think we are, stupid? Yea! Same to you! - Can you believe him? - Look it here, Daze. Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line. "Be your best in my new signature dress. Let them know you mean business at the Disco or in the boardroom, with the amazing versatility of the premiere piece, in my high end line, a super stylish couture. Who's better than you girl?" Oh man! - How much is it? - Around 300 bucks. - How do you know? - I know because Stacy Culpepper's got one. And everybody was talking about it. Let's get ours. - We can't. - Why not? Because we blew the money on rent again. Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe... What? Again, Vi? Call Russ back before he gives the job away. - We got it. - What... He said it was an easy gig, right? - Yea. - Up the money too, didn't he? Yea. Then what are we waiting for? That's shit! Hey Russ, it's me Daisy. I know what we said. but, we've changed our mind and we thought... we considered your offer. And we think, that actually it'd work out quite well because um... See, the day that you talked about... Deeper baby, deeper... Ow, gross! You weren't suppose to like it! Like I've end up better do with it, Princess. Are you guys hear about this guy? Ok so basically, there was this guy who stole some shit from Chet. - What did this guy take from him? - A truck full of cologne. Now this truck contains somethin' in addition to just cologne. - Somethin' like what? - A bag full of money. The weird part, is the guy called us up... and had the stones to taunt us after he did what he did. - Stones... - Or some kind of a death wish. Cos he all gave us his address. His name and number, was clear as day the whole time he was fuckin' with us. Culpepper lives about three blocks from this dude. She's checked him out. Says he leaves in the morning, comes back in the afternoon. When he comes home, you'll be waiting for him. And that's that. The landlord's on our team, so the door will be open. - Better be. - Relax, the door will be open. And you don't have to worry about the noise either. - Why not? - The building's almost empty. Switching over the condos or some kinda gentrificational kind of shit. You sure this guy was working alone, Russ? Pretty sure! Landlord said the guy's a loner. This happens tomorrow. - Can you handle it? - 'Course we can handle it. You got the specs? Now we good? Yeah, we good. Come on, Daze. Hey you guys hear about Barbie Sunday's new dress? - Yea we know. - Just checkin'. Daze! Yea? Happy Birthday! Thanks, Russ. If you keep an eye on your partner, you might be around see your next one. Fuck off, Russ! Ask her about Rose. I said fuck off, Russ! Who's Rose? My old partner. - I thought I was your only... - Sorry Daze. Well, what happened to her? - She died. - How? - Got shot. - How? Usual way. Somebody pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger. - Who? - It's complicated. - Well, it all kinda make sense now. - Why? You talked about her in your sleep sometimes. I do? Yea. - Vi? - Yea, man. I can't wait until we get the dresses. Things are gonna change for us after that. Oh, hell yeah! - Do we need to chain it up? - Nah, this will do. - Cool? - Cool. This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you. Okay? or anything else... I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't... I threw out those flowers. You can't fix it. And I'm really... done with you. I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again. I want you to leave me alone. Please, okay? You don't know how to fix this. You can't fix it. You, have no clue. Just... leave me alone. I don't ever wanna hear from you again. Wake me up, when the latch turns. But what if... This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze. But... Just keep a look out while I go in dream about the dress. Oh my God! Is that the guy? - What's going on? - I don't know. - Why didn't he take our guns or...? - I don't know. - Should we wake him up or just pop him? - I don't know Daze. Hey, girls. There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry. - Do you know why we're here? - Yes, I've been expecting you. I think there's must be some sort of misunderstanding. We're not here to clean your bathtub up. Organize your closet or make you happy. Really? Yeah. We're here to kill you. Then there's no misunderstanding at all. Do you mind if I have a word with my partner? Wait a sec. Search him, Daze. He's clean, Vi. Come on then. - This isn't go much like we pictured it, Vi. - Yeah, I know. I just wish it more like a normal job. Now it's weird. I never really talked to a job before. This might be some kind of test. Everything's a test, when you're a career woman. Damn right. And those dresses aren't gonna buy themselves. - I got it! - What? - I know we could do! - What? Why don't we just go in there? Blasting without thinking about it. That way, we don't have to think about it. We don't even have to look either, because we're never gonna miss it that distance. It's a good plan, Daze. A real good one! - You think so? - Totally. Cool. - Don't aim too high. - Why not? We don't want to that little bird. Oh, yea... good thinkin'. Are you ready? - Ready. - Let's do it. Who wants a snack? Be careful they're hot. Uhm... no thank you. - Don't you like cookies? - Yeah, but... I feel kind of bad now. - Don't be ridiculous. - Are those oatmeal? Thanks, mister. What's wrong? Wait a minute, did you put something in this? Why are you looking at us funny? No, no, no... It just that you girls aren't what I expect it. We didn't picture you either. Keeps life interesting I guess. Do you have any milk? I hate to interrupt or anything, but... don't you think you girls are better be load? Excuse me, but what is your deal? I rather not discuss it. - Why not? - That's my business, that's why not. What's the big... I thought for sure they'd send professionals. They did! Then why is it matter what I don't want to discuss? Wouldn't you be curious if you were us? There's a place around the corner if you need more ammo. - We got ammo. - Then let's get this show on the road. Expecting company. - What kind of company? - Rather not say, except to say we probably don't wanna be here when they arrived. - They? Who's "they"? - Is this an interview or a hit? Whatever man. You got anymore cookies? Maybe, maybe not. How about this, if you shoot me, I'll tell you where they are, - and I'll throw in the recipe. - How are you gonna do that dead? - Start shooting and find out. - Hardy har har. Excuse me, I need to confer with my colleague. - Again? - Yea, again. Don't worry I won't move this time. I'll be right here, when you get back. I know we gotta off this guy, cos that's what we gotta do. But I don't wanna do it until I know why he wants us to do it. I mean, something's wrong here. What is this, Daze? I mean a guy doesn't just up and hijacked a truck chuck full of cash and cologne, to get himself rub out. There are other ways. I want this guy's story, but getting it would just make our job harder, I mean it changes everything. That's why they don't name any other pigs on a sausage farm. And for that reason, I don't think we should talk to him anymore. That's gonna be tough, He's interesting. He sure is. How about those cookies? Oh man! Have you ever had anything like that in your whole life? If we were rich, and didn't have to kill him, we could pay him, just to make those cookies for us all the time. Hell, what if the cookies are just the tip of the iceberg? What if he makes brownies? We'd get so fat, but it'd be so worth it. Anyway, let's just do it as we said before, We just runnin' there blast him. - You bring anymore ammo? - No. I thought you said you have some more. Nah, I just wanted to sound pro and say I did. It's not like we're facing five or six jokers who's shotgunned one of Chet's night club. Besides, I was tryin' to save up for the dresses. Never get to hang of this. There must've a time in your bucket list that I wouldn't sweat it. Where's that place again? What place? The place, where you said we could get the bullet. I thought you had some. Well, I was mistaken. I've got a pretty good steak knife... Just try to help. You go out the front door, you hook a right. Then walk three blocks straight down, its on this side of the street. You can't miss it. - I'll go Daze. - Why can't I? Because you look 12, and I've an ID. We might actually checked in this part of town. Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone, and remember what I said. Okay. You guys need anything? No, we're good. So how long have you two been friends? I'm not supposed to really talk to you anymore, so... Oh, wait! I think you got a phone message. But that's all I'm sayin', now I'm gonna zip. You have one new message. This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you. Okay? or anything else... I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't... I threw out those flowers. You can't fix it. And I'm really... done with you. I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again. I want you to leave me alone... Me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time. Maybe three years. What? You asked how long we've been friends a minute ago. Oh yes... Alright. - We met in a hospital. - In a hospital? Yea. It was that dull hospital over at Lexington, know it? No. We were doctors. I mean, surgeons. Violet tells me to say surgeons. Working at the hospital never gave me bad dreams, that's for sure. Anyway, she's my best friend ever. I'm kinda worry about her sometimes though. Half the time, I wish I was more like her. And then... What? I don't know. She reminds me of my daughter. Is that her on the phone machine? But it's not important. It is, but... don't let it distract you. - What's with that? - What's with what? The numbers you two have. - This? - Yes. Oh, that's our rank. Officially I'm killer number Nine and Violet's killer number Eight. And how do you move up? Makin' hits. Vi says it beats dead entries. Who's number one? No one ever seen him. But he once killed three ninjas... with a fingernail file. Who's this? There's a place about two blocks up from you, it's look like a hardware store. If it's closed, that's only what the sign says. Hold on, hold on, I gotta take a piss. Oh what else is it... How many times you must take a piss and you gotta take a piss? - Not every time - Good spot here. Every single time I gotta take a piss, you gotta take a piss! You're not supposed to look down when you pee next to another man, ok? - I'm not looking... - You're lookin' down, I saw you look down! - I'm looking at your face. - My man, why are you looking at me all? Dude you get me worried about you sometimes. Don't you know pee etiquette man? Let's hope she hurries. What's the big deal?! Who's comin' over? It's not important. It's not like I'm asking you to tell me where you stashed that money or anything. I'm expecting company because of something else I did. What else did you do? I robbed somebody. Somebody else that's not our Boss? Yea. Who? - Donnie Daffo. - Oh, my... And you really are serious about getting yourself killed? I figure it's people who visit me today as well. Small world, cos uh... me and Vi hate those guy's guts. Two months ago Violet ran into them, and they locked her in a dumpster. It looks like someone had taken a life out of her. Is that all they did? You mean, locked her in that trashcan? Well, yea, I mean that's all she told me. What else would they...? Russ is such an ass. Thinks he's smart, but he's not. Nothin' to say this time? Maybe you've learned your lesson after all. I'd like a somethin' for you to tell your boss. In this fuckin' economy that chicken shit must be pretty hard up. to send a little... cunt like you, to do a men's job. Fuck you later! - Hi. - We're closed, what do you want? - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - Yeah you do. The black door in the back. Much obliged. How can I help you? Let's go, let's go, come on. Move fast. Check out those boxes right there. Let's go, move on. "But dude! You're a vegetarian!" - See? - Oh... That's... clap! One, two, three, four, five battle. Alright tardy cake! - No, you're first! - You are... no. You do this and... Hey! Look who's here? We just saw your stupid little girl friend. Had to tell about herself. You should see her face. Just this mornin' we got to whack a couple of clowns. Yea, we took our time doin' it too. Your stupid little girlfriend looks scared than both those faggots put together. Even when things are getting up before them. Step aside jail-bait! Or don't! If you wanna be a tough guy and see what happens to you. Do it, do what they say, Daisy. Can I ask you fellas something? - Nah, forget it. - Come on. Excuse me? Please. - Everybody! - Please. Very good! But I won't get into it until you holster the hardware! - Why would we do that? - So you don't get tired. - What you think we are, stupid? - Off course I think you're stupid. That's the point. You're gonna have enough trouble keepin' up with what I'm gonna tell you as it is. If you tuck it out too, we'll be wastin' everybody's time. You don't want mama's good wisdom goin' to waste, do you? Heck, I'll be surprised if your arms are burnin' already, for keeping us at gun's points for a while. I mean, it's not like we're packed or anything, what do you afraid of? That better? - Alright, where was I? - You're gonna ask us something. Oh that's right, Thanks! Okay. So... here it goes. My partner weighs in at about 95 pounds, right? And together you guys are pushing half a ton, give or take, right? So, did you need much help stuffin' her in that garbage can? Now... I usually don't talk to people like you in the first place, but... if I did that sort of things, I would say that you girls should have your own TV show. And that you should call that program "The Adventure of Donnie's Bitches". But like I said at the top, I usually don't talk to people like you. Because talkin' to people like you doesn't make much sense. What do you mean, "People like us"? What the hell kind of people are we? Dead ones. What? Found some bullets, but now I might be out again. How about you partner? I think I'm hearin' somethin'. Something like what? The internal bleeding dance! - I could sure use some help too. - You got it, partner! - Move! I want the fat one! - They're all fat, Biatch! Say mister, you got any other leads on where I can get some more bullets? The other place got into a crime scene, long story. Just do some thinkin' on it, okay? Are you expectin' anybody else? Are you sure? It might be back up for Donnie's crew. Maybe they're supposed to call in, you know, like we do. Why didn't they just come right in like everybody else has? I don't know, who the hell he is, I'm out of bullets again. I'll get it. What? Wait but... what if Donnie's other guys? - I know what they'll do. - I thought you wanted us to kill you. You jealous? - Kinda. - Now take the fire escape. I'll stall. Otherwise they're gonna kill us all today after see what happened in here. Go! - You should come too! - No, no, I shouldn't. This way I buy you some time. Go! Please. Go, go, go! Everything ok in there? I thought I heard something. It's fine... Dolores. - How you've been? - I thought I heard somethin'. You know, I did too. Sound it's like coming from the upstairs again. I was sure it was coming from here. - Did you try next door? - Are you sure everything's okay in there? Yes. I really should go now, Dolores. You take care. - Well ain't... - Dolores! Dolores... Take care. - Couldn't get it right... go! - Go! 115th precinct, Officer Minocha speaking. There's something wrong in the apartment down the hall from me. We're going to take care of him too, you know. I know. - I think we should do it now. - Why? He's sleeping... it will be merciful. Oh I thought, we're out of bullets again. We are, but I can run out and go get some more somewhere real quick. We couldn't even do it now even if we had the bullets. - Why not? - I don't know. He said, he wanted to see it coming. - When? - While you're out. - Did he say anything else? - Like what? Like, why he wants to check out so bad? - A little. - Well? He's....got bad cancer. It's in my pancreas and spreading. Going to die and I'd rather not take the scenic route. I don't think he has anybody who loves him either, it must be even worse. We should think about going to his funeral. You know, just so there's someone there. What? What?! At the end of the day, Donnie'll send survivin' members of his squad to finish the job either way. So if it's not us to finish, it would be somebody else. And besides, this guy's dead already! In fact, it's way better if we're the ones to do it. Because unlike Donnie's punks, we're not gonna torture him for eight or nine hours first. Did you hear somethin'? What happened to you anyway? You look a little mussed up. What's with the it chilled? - This? - Yea. I've been deputized. - I'm serious, Vi. - Fine! I had a little incident while I was out getting the bullets. - Do you wanna talk about it? - Are you interested? Always. So the seconds I get the lead, Three desperados stormed in and hold up the spot. First I'm thinkin', I was gonna lay low, and I'll be free and let this shit be. Then, one of them sees me and gets the bright idea that they should rob me too. So I proceeded to inform the perp and his pals, about multiple ways in which they might violated their mothers. So while they're trying to figure out where I got the balls, the cops showed up. Was it because of the police has a silent alarm? No. Was it because the cops just got lucky? Hell, no! This place is a stone's throw from the 115th precinct. So the minute I remembered that little detail, I'm thinking one or two things, these desperados are either stupid or crazy as whole hell. Whatever the case, the cops apprehended the whole crew, and then one of the fuzzy wuzzy asked me if I'm ok. So I said "Officer, how do you know I wasn't in on it? What makes you think a girl can't be in on it?" Next thing I hear is... Bang, bang, bang! The guy behind the register flipped and starts shooting at the perps. It seems the other company at the counter took the robbery personally. Long story short, just about everybody ended up taking a shot or two, except for yours truly. That's how I got this one chilled on me. It was blasted off of the porker and just went it there. Scout's honor. Anyway, right about then, I thought it may be prudent to exit the premises to the rear. Some days, you just can't get a bullet to save your life. And here of all places. I mean, shit, this is America right? But... how did you get so dirty? I slipped on banana peel in alley way comin' back. Let's go see about those dresses. How are you girls holding up? Fine. Fine. We're out of bullets again tho. Why don't you use one of those guy's guns? They seem to have plenty. Why the hell didn't I think of that? These guys got everything Daze! Even a little Glock for your purse. You know the blue one? It's like Christmas! I got you... Sucker! Take your pick mister. Why don't you decide? Okay, let's see... I'm gonna go with the .38, Daze. Alright, are you ready mister? Sure. Okay. Here goes nothin'. Hardy har har. What? Are you done yet? Come again? I said "Are you done yet?" What are you talking about? You weren't serious you're gonna do it, were you? I most certainly was. With that piece? Yea. - Suit yourself. - Wha... Why shouldn't I? It's unprofessional. How's that? Forensics. - Forensics? - Yea. Forensics. Ballistics. There's a real good chance, those dorks would foul everything up for us if we do it like this. I mean Donnie's guys can even wind up with the credit if they traced the guns and... boss try to weasel out of payin' us. Even worse, we might get blamed for every corpse in here. And boss'd chaff us to the hill on account of unnecessary roughness. Not to mention the gang war we might've already started. And it's not even like we can switch out the bullets, because the calibers won't begin to match the ones of our styles and rods. So, like I said, you can do it your way if you want to, but... We risk looking on professional and getting screwed... out of a couple of hot dresses. Good thinkin', Daze. Forensics will fuck you. You would've thought of it too, Vi. - Yea, maybe. - I need a smoke. You do that? When did you start doin' that? I don't know. Where did you get those? Oh, from those guys. You mind if I'm smoking in your place, mister? Yea. - Yea you mind or yea it's okay? - Yea, I mind. Actually... Do what you like. It doesn't matter anyway. I'll take it out to the stairs. Oh Violet, you might wanna wipe your prints off those pieces. Put them back on the fellas. Sounds good, Daze. Come on sit down! I wanna show you something. You know you'd probably a millionaire if you clean your ears out more often. No uh! Here. Now what were you going to tell me? Yea, the secret. You were going to tell me. Can I ask you somethin'? Why is she so mad at you? - She's your friend, you tell me. - I'm not talking about Violet! - She blames me for something. - For what? - Her mother's death. - Why, did you kill her? No, no. She died after she left me. - Why did she leave you? - She didn't love me. - Why didn't she love you? - I don't know, Daisy. I don't think people have a lot of control over that sort of thing. As a husband, I wasn't much a prize anyway. Whatever the case, she... fell in love with someone else. Who? A man she used to work with. I didn't know him. I only saw him once. From a distance. They died in a car accident. How does your daughter figured that it's your fault? Well, my daughter didn't know about the affair. She blamed me for the breakup. And consequently the... car accident. Well... did you ever tell her the whole story? - No. - Why not? Because I want her to remember her mother the way she does now. That's stupid! You're stupid! - Thank you. - Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday? - What? - Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday? Very much. Well, at least she did somethin' right. Now, I'm gonna get some bullets and we've done with all these. Tell Violet. You like my partner, don't you? What's not to like? She's....a sweet girl. Do you like her better than me? I don't know you as well. That's okay. I like her better than me too. She might even... thinks she'll keep you alive for some silly reasons. Kids... - May I ask you a question, Violet? - You may ask. You ever miss the doll house? Not particularly. And I think I know what you're driving at, mister. But this job never got to me, aside from the sensational rush to the action. - What about those men? - What men? The ones you killed. That, was fucking magical. Did you see that? It's a bit early to know, but career wise... that little miracle might be my Monalisa. If not my Billie Jean. - Actually... - Do you have any family? What? Do you have any family? - What a random question. - Well, do you? Daisy is like family. You didn't answer the question. I got a father somewhere. What's with the interview? When's the last time you and he spoke? - What do you care? - That long huh? - Are you afraid of what's next? - Me getting shot? I mean after that. I haven't thought about it. And? I haven't come up with anything conclusive. I'm not an expert or anything, but I have a theory. Yea? I figure... I figure heaven... is probably a place where, nobody cares how big or small you are, or what you look like. People probably don't even have bodies. They're just maybe like... essences or something. But if they do have bodies, everyone's gotta be naked for sure, cause that's we all showed up here in the first place, right? And also, if you have a back problem... or bad knees or self-esteem issues. That stuffs won't bother you anymore up there. And everything's free too. Or at least whole sale. I don't know if there's animal, but that'd be cool. Oh yea, and when you walkin' in to the gate for the very first time. They're probably playin' that Louis Armstrong's song. Somethin' nice like that. Part of this came from this girl I knew. She died. It's a long story. Anyway, she thought everybody would be naked, that part was her idea. - How did she die? - I don't wanna talk about it! I mean, I do but... when I tried, never works. Maybe someday. Wow! Sit up. Who wants some snack? You know what? Wow! What? I don't think there are enough holes here, from that first time me and Daisy came out blastin'. Is that important? Could be. In any case I've a feeling that my partner is not exactly holdin' up her end. I've never... actually... really ever killed anybody. I've been using blanks. I just make sure me and Violet don't share ammunitions. Like I said, she's so fierce and thorough on the job. I could pack a squirt gun, it just wouldn't matter. How do you mean, holding up her end? I mean, that I might be the only one takin' up the trash. - Means it looks like she's been packin' blanks. - So what? - So what? - Yea, so what? Even if she isn't taking people out, isn't it better that she's with you? You think your partner's having two targets instead of one? but it saved you behind a time or two? Do you understand, she's risking her life as well? Do you think your friendship might've helped keep you sane? - as you wandered through this life of yours? - There's still the principle. We have rules and what she might've been doin', is a big no-no, no matter how you slice it. Cos one day you're packin' blanks and the next you're wearin' the wire. So what you're going to do about it? I might've to take her out, if my suspicion is true. I thought Daisy was your friend. I'm not sayin' I'm gonna like it. I thought you said she was like family? She is. But she's a business woman too, so she'll understand. I always figure to check out first anyway. - Why? - Because that how usually goes for the good ones. You got a hair dryer? Unit 42, come in. Unit 42, respond to dispatch. You just missed her. - Daze? - She just left. Who? Rose. - Was she alive? - I don't know. But she asked about you. What did she say? She said: "I'm looking for your partner." Those were her exact words. - Is that all she said? - No. She said that roses were dead, and violets were too. She's fled after that and that's the end of it. How long have you been here? She's taller than I thought. How long have you been here, Daze? I can't really tell. Time is bend up now, so I don't know. I keep missing my flights. What's that? Oh, that? That's his. The guy's. Rose is back. Hello, Number 9. Oh my! Are you...? Wow! - I always figure you're... - You always figure out as what? Imaginary. Or a boy. Do you know what I've been doing today? I've been watching you and your partner. Did you hear somethin'? That partner of yours is clean out of her mind And she's gonna put us all in a real bad spot. We can't let that happen. I can't let that happen. I won't let that happen. Do you even know what grief her little sloth is gonna cost us? Well, I'll tell you. Two of the idiots that she ventilated, were engaged. Do you know who'll they're gonna marry? The Police Chief's stepdaughters. And you can bet the house once they sort out all these rubbish. Boss is gonna be held accountable, next to that, a garden of variety gang war would be a sunday stroll. - There was a dead guy at the bottom of the steps. - He saw me! Can I ask you a question, Ma'am? Do you always work by yourself? Yes. Is it lonely? What's that to you? Just wondering. Well then, let's get back to business, cos I'm late for my ballet class. Finish the job or face the consequences. Am I clear? Well... I got news for you, Number One. Given the situation, I see why you're T.O and all. But, what's done is done. And my partner comes first. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means... that if you try to take her out or get into the middle of our job, you're in front world of hurt! I know what you're capable of, but we're pros too. We also know that you're comin' now. Do you know what I wanted to be when I was your age? I don't either. I like you kid. You're in over your head and you're scared, yet you look death in the eye without blinking. It's admirable, but it won't save you. It won't save your partner and it won't save your new pal. Finish the job or face the consequences. You've got an hour. Sorry about that stuff I said before. What's them? When I called you stupid and stuff. That's okay. Did you find anymore bullets all around? Hey. Wanna hear somethin'? Your daughter doesn't hate you. How do you know? I know. Well, could you? You never even met her. Doesn't matter. I still know she doesn't hate you. How? I'm a daughter too. Vi? She left. Where did she go? To get more bullets. Listen carefully, Daisy. When she comes back, I need for you to be the one to put me down. It's very important. Why me? Cause you and me are friends, right? - I guess, but... - Will you promise me that? - I can't. - I need you to promise me. - But I can't. - I need you to do this for me. - I can't. - I need you to do this for me! - No, I can't! - Don't argue with me, April! - But I'm Daisy. - Just don't argue with me girl! You promise me. Say it. - I promise. - You promise? I said I would, didn't I? I have something to show you. I tried to give it to my daughter, but she... threw it back at me. I think you're about her size. Could you try it on? I'll wait in the other room. Got the bullets. You'll be surprised how many places I... What's goin' on? How do I look? Ok. Where did you get it? He gave it to me. What for? I don't know, Vi. Can I talk to you a minute? Have you lost your mind? - What's your problem? - You're my problem! I'll let you borrow it some time if that's what this is about. It's not about the fucking dress! - Yea, right. - That's exactly right! You don't run me, Violet! We don't know anybody. or get involved in stuff or anything like that. I never went to a prom. You did, but I didn't. - Be glad you didn't! - Why? - Because they would laugh at you! - How do you know? Because that's what they do if you're different. Everybody isn't like that, Vi. And so what if they laugh? - So what? - Don't tell me what I know... you haven't been through things like me. And I hope I'll never do, if that makes me so scared. - I'm not scared! - Yes you are, Violet. You don't trust anyone, or anything.. You never did. I trusted you! What? I said I trusted you! When did you stop? The second I saw that goddamn dress on your back! That's just perfect then. Why? Because now you don't have anything at all. - So what are you trying to say? - I just said it. Say it again, if you have the guts. - You heard me! - I'm gonna kick your ass! Cut it off bitch! You're gonna mess up my new dress. My landlady was coming up the street. I was just... just messin' with her. Never shot a gun before. - How was it? - What do you aim on for some new shoes now? - Shut up about it! - You shut up about it! - Make me! - I just did! - Oh, is that what you call it? - Violet! What? I almost forgot, I got something for you too. Really? - Why are you giving this to me? - You have a unique world of view. Now you can share with others... in a new way. Thanks a lot, mister. I need the police. Yes, that's my address. What are you doin'? He's writing a letter. To who? To "whom". To whom? His daughter. I'll do it. What? I'll write it for you. Alright. Thank you. So where was I? "Dear April..." That's it? So far, yeah. "Dear April, I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I hope you do. In any case... It's time we finally talk. Please, take care of yourself. I managed to put some money in your bank account. Please use it to continue your education. Your mother would've wanted that too. Don't worry about the dead men in the bathtub. It's not what it looks like. And a long story to tell right now. Sometimes, for no particular reason, I think of you and smile. Seriously about that day, that... we drove out to the mall, for your birthday. Your mom had the flu, and she said to go on without her. I remember you wandered off. Got lost. And two hours later, we finally found each other. We hugged... You didn't wanna let go. Then we went for ice cream, and we talked... all the way home. I think that was the happiest day I've had. I know I probably wasn't the best father in the world, but I tried the best I could. Anyway... I loved you all that I possibly can. Love, Dad." "PS: This isn't in my handwriting, because friend of mine wrote it out for me." If you just leave that in the... apartment when you go, make sure to get to her. Glad you girls came by. I wouldn't have written that otherwise. Daze... We gotta go now, Daze. We never even said his name, Vi. Come on. The bike is gone. I know. - Well, we got 'em. - Yeap. - Yours look awesome on you. - Yea, so did yours. Hey, I know we never really talked about stuff... since that day. Are we cool? Yea. Course. Precious. Hey, you hungry or anything? Not really. I'm just gonna take a walk. Yea, screw food. I could use a nap if you wanna know the truth. You want me take your bag home? No? This better not be Russ. It's my Dad. Really? I've tried to get the pizza place, but I... I pressed his number instead. Long story. Hang on a sec, Phil. See you Daze! Hey Dad. April? Are you... uhm, April? Hi. Hi. I was a friend of your father's. I just want to let you know that... I was a friend of his and... that he talked about you a lot. He wanted me to give something to you too. What is it? It's the new Barbie Sunday dress. - For real? - Yea. I think it should fit. There's something else in there too. Thanks. You're welcome. Your father was a good guy, April. He told me how you two got lost in the mall one day and then had ice cream. Well... See ya.
