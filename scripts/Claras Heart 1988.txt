YOU DON'T SEEM TOO HEALTHY YOURSELF. YOU'RE A JERK. WELL, IF I'M A JERK, YOU'RE A BOBO. THEN YOU'RE A SUPER-DWEEB. IF I AM A SUPER-DWEEB, YOU ARE A BUBU-YAGA. DON'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE.

THAT'S THE BES I CAN DO FOR TODAY, SO JUST TAKE YOURSELF OUT OF HERE. GOOD-BYE. GET YOUR DIRTY HANDS OUT OF THERE. I HOPE THEY LIKE HIYAKI AS MUCH AS I DO. IT STRONGLY RESEMBLES BABY PUKE. IT'S GOT SOME OF THA IN IT, ABSOLUTELY. MY, BUT YOU'RE OBSERVANT. I LEFT SOME TOTOS IN THE OVEN FOR THE LITTLE BOY. I'M NO A LITTLE BOY. YOU ACT LIKE ONE. I GOT ALL CONFUSED. SHIRTS. I NEED SHIRTS.

I ASKED YOU POLITELY. NO, IT WAS NOT POLITE. IT WAS ONLY PRETEND POLITE. NOW, LET'S SEE WHAT AGONY YOU'VE BROUGHT HOME FROM SCHOOL WITH YOU TODAY. YOU. THE AGONY IS YOU. CHILD, YOU CAN BUILD UP YOUR ARMS WITH THESE WEIGHTS, BUT IT AIN'T GONNA MAKE YOU TALLER. IN THE MEANTIME, YOU MUST NO INDULGE IN PITY AND SHOOT OFF YOUR MOUTH. [MUSIC BOX PLAYING BRAHM'S LULLABY] I JUST THOUGH I'D SEE WHAT'S HERE. MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A GARAGE SALE OR SOMETHING. IT'S TIME TO DISMANTLE THE NURSERY, MRS. HART. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY MORE CHILDREN. YOU GOT ONE CHILD LEFT. YOU POUR YOUR SOUL INTO HIM. CHUCK IT IN THE BOX. MAYBE WE SHOULD KEEP ONE. WHY? WHY YOU NEED A TOKEN OF SOMEBODY ONLY TO BE HAUNTED BY THEM THE RES OF YOUR LIFE? WASN'T YOUR FAUL SHE DIED. IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT. [HUMMING] THAT CHILD, THAT LITTLE BOY CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER AND ALL TIME. THAT LITTLE BOY TAUGHT ME THE JOY OF LIVING FOR SOMEONE OTHER THAN MYSELF. AND YET, WHEN HE WAS KILLED, I CONTINUED TO SLEEP AND WAKE AND BREATHE, AND IN MY AGONY AND MY ANGER I CONTAMINATED ANYONE AND EVERYONE THAT HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO TOUCH ME. SO AFTER I DEMOLISHED MY MARRIAGE, I TRULY REALIZED THAT IF I WASN' GOING TO KILL MYSELF, I HAD TO GET ON WITH MY LIVING. SO ALL RIGHT, IT'S A SORROW WITHOUT END, BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO DIE THE REST OF OUR LIVES TO PROVE THAT WE HUR OR THAT WE'RE LONELY. SO ALL RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S JUS TOO BAD, ISN'T IT? I'M TELLING YOU, THAT'S IT. CAN WE JUS DROP IT? I'M NOT DROPPING ANYTHING. EDITH IS GONE. IT'S NOT ABOUT EDITH. LET'S STOP BLAMING EVERYTHING ON THE BABY. IT'S JUST FINE WITH ME. SO WHAT DO YOU WAN TO DUMP EVERYTHING ON NOW? HMM? IT'S NO THE OTHER WOMEN. IT'S NOT ANY ONE THING. WHAT OTHER WOMEN? IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM. IT'S ABOUT US. I REALIZED TODAY THAT'S WHY I GOT PREGNANT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD CHANGE THINGS. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WORST OF IT, BILL? THE WORST OF IT IS WE'RE NOT EVEN FRIENDS ANYMORE. WHEN WERE WE FRIENDS? REALLY, WHEN? ONCE. THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I'M TRYING TO CHANGE THINGS. THAT'S FINE, LEE. THAT HAS REAL MERIT, BUT DON'T REDESIGN ME. BLANCHE LOUDON. OH, CLARA MAYFIELD. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU'RE LOOKIN' LIKE A BABY.

IF ANY OF YOU ARE SO MOVED EVEN TO ACT SILLY-- SING SONGS, PLAY GAMES, ROLL IN THE GRASS-- YOU CAN DO IT BECAUSE TODAY I'M NOT YOUR THERAPIST. I'M NOT YOUR GROUP LEADER. NO, I'M A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO DREAMED OF SINGING IN A ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND. IF ANYONE WANTS TO JOIN ME, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW I ALMOST SUCCEEDED EXCEPT FOR ONE SMALL DISABILITY-- I COULDN'T SING. ALL RIGHT, LET'S BREAK, GO, AND IMMEDIATELY COMMENCE TO HAVE FUN. HI. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? SO AFTER MY SINGING CAREER WENT INTO THE PORCELAIN FACILITY, FOR A TIME THERE, I THOUGH I WANTED TO BE A RABBI, BUT I COULDN'T IMAGINE SITTING THROUGH BAR MITZVAHS FOR THE RES OF MY LIFE OR THINKING OF GOD AS A THREE-SYLLABLE WORD.

YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THE POLARITY... WHAT YOU DOING? TRYING TO FIND MYSELF AN APARTMENT. YOU'RE LEAVING? YOU THINK I WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT MUCH PLEASURE? HOW COME AN APARTMENT? SO I GOT SOMEPLACE TO GO WHEN I'M NOT WORKING INSTEAD OF WITH ME FRIENDS. THEN WHEN MY HUSBAND GETS HERE, HE'S GOT SOMEPLACE TO STAY WHILE I'M WORKING. WHEN'S HE COMING? I DON'T KNOW YET. OK, DAVE, THIS IS IT! DON'T BE GIVING THE CHILD DIARRHEA BEFORE HE EVEN GETS THERE. LET ME BE THE PARENT, CLARA. WHAT DO YOU SAY? THAT'S JUS AS IT SHOULD BE. DON'T PUSH IT, OK? BUT OF COURSE.

YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LIVING AT HOME REGULARLY. IT SUDDENLY DAWNED ON YOU STAYING OUT SO MUCH MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST THING FOR A KID WHO'S DEPENDEN ON A BLACK WOMAN WHO'S NO SPEAKING TO HIM. WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING MY LIVING ARRANGEMENTS. I SEE DAVID AMPLY. AMPLY? WHAT IS THAT? AN ACCEPTED WAY OF SEEING SOMEONE? MAKE YOUR POINT, BILL. YOU SAY YOU ARE STUDYING TO BE A LAY THERAPIST-- NO PUN INTENDED. DOESN'T IT OCCUR TO YOU PUTTING YOUR CHILD IN THERAPY WITH A STRANGER WILL MAKE HIM FEEL MORE SEPARATE? IF I THOUGHT THAT, WOULD I BE DOING IT? PREDICTING YOUR MOTIVES IS NO SOMETHING I CARE TO MAKE BOOK ON. YOU WANT ME TO PAY FOR THIS TREATMENT? I ONLY WAN YOUR SUPPORT. THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU TO COME HERE. I WISH I COULD BELIEVE THAT. I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU'RE SENDING A CHILD INTO THERAPY. STAY OU OF THIS. MESS UP YOUR OWN LIVES. DON'T DRAG HIM INTO IT. DON'T TALK TO US THAT WAY. DON'T YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THIS. WE HAVE A JAMAICAN SAYING-- NOBODY GIVES A DAMN ABOUT THAT. I DO. STAY OU OF THIS. "THE HIGHER THE MONKEY CLIMB, THE MORE HE EXPOSE." YOU TELL HER YOU'RE NO INTERESTED, SHE TELLS YOU ANYWAY. CAN I ASK A QUESTION? WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? NOTHING'S WRONG WITH YOU. PSYCHIATRISTS JUS HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF BETTER. WILL CLARA TALK TO ME AGAIN? HE MIGHT HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DISREGARDED HER PRIVACY. THEY'LL MAKE FUN OF ME AT SCHOOL. DON'T YOU SEE THAT'S PAR OF THE PROBLEM? CAN DR. EPSTEIN STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT? I MEAN, LOOK WHAT'S HE'S DONE FOR YOU. BILL, I SWEAR TO GOD-- YOU LEAVE GOD OUT OF THIS MESS. I'LL MAKE SURE THE CHILD GOES TO A PSYCHIATRIST, BUT YOU LEAVE THIS BOY OUT THE MIDDLE. I REALLY RESEN YOUR INTRUSION INTO THIS. THEN FIRE ME, MR. HART. HE'S NOT FIRING ANYBODY. DAVID, YOU COME WITH ME. I DON'T BELIEVE I QUITE FOLLOW YOU, DAVID. PHOTOS FROM OLD FAMILY ALBUMS. YOU AND CLARA? WE PIN THEM ON THE WALL AND THROW DARTS AT THEM. WE HAD A 5-3-1 SCORING SYSTEM. PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOUR FATHER? THEY WERE OLD ONES-- WHEN HE HAD HIS MUSTACHE. HE HATES THEM. YOU SWEAR YOU WON' TELL ANYONE WHA I CONFIDED IN YOU BECAUSE, FRANKLY, IF MY DAD FOUND OUT, HE'D REALLY BE UPSET. I'M SURE HE WOULD BE. I MEAN, HE REALLY THOUGH HE LOOKED LIKE A STUD IN THAT MUSTACHE. I TAKE I YOU'RE NOT CRAZY ABOUT YOUR FATHER. WHAT ELSE DID THE TWO OF YOU DO? US TWO WHO? YOU AND CLARA. WE DID THINGS TOGETHER WHERE SHE DIDN'T ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU DO. OUR TIME'S UP FOR TODAY. WHY DON'T I NOT ASK YOU ANY MORE QUESTIONS UNTIL NEXT WEEK? YOU TOLD THAT MAN THAT WE THROW DARTS AT PICTURES OF YOUR FATHER? I TOLD HIM WE HAD A SCORING SYSTEM. THAT WAS WRONG. NEVER PUT ME UP AGAINST YOUR PARENTS, NOT EVEN IN JEST. YOU TOLD ME TO LIE. I KNOW, BUT I DID NOT MEAN... THAT MAN MUST THINK THAT I LOVE BOTH OF YOUR PARENTS EQUALLY. MMM. YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH, I SEE. NOW, I'M NOT UPSET. I JUST GO A LITTLE OVEREXCITED. THERE MUST BE ROOM FOR MISTAKES WHEN YOU PLAY GAMES SUCH AS THESE. I'LL BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME. NOW, DAVID HART, WE MUST THINK OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY DEVILISH TO TELL THIS MAN NEXT WEEK.

AND WHEN HE WAS 15, HE FELL IN LOVE WITH DORA CAMBRIDGE. SHE PLAYED WITH HIM. WHEN SHE WAS DONE PLAYING WITH HIM, SHE THREW HIM AWAY. AND MY SON RAPED DORA CAMBRIDGE. WHEN I FOUND OU THAT RALPHIE HAD RAPED DORA, I WEN AND CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT... BY TELLING HIM... THAT HE WAS NO LONGER MY SON... AND THA HE HAD DISGRACED ME. AND RALPHIE...
