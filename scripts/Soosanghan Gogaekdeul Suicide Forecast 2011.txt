Very nice. Your dream is my dream. There's a category where our team placed first in the first two quarters. Know what that is? Wow, we placed first? If it was something worthy, the bosses upstairs won't bitch at us. Financial loss. Insurance money is pouring out to the clients like open floodgate. Why? They're dying lef and right. Why did they die? Sui... cide? That's right, suicide. So if the clients die like that, do we pay out or not? Afer 2-year payment period, it should be paid. That's right. But you can't, no way, no can do! If your clients ask, what do you say? Absolutely not! And why isn't Byeong-wu here? Where is that bastard? - Hello, chairman. - I'm sorry for making you wait. - It's nothing at all. - Please have a seat. Thank you. How old are you this year, Byeong-wu? Ah, I'm 33. I've heard many good things about you. I hope that this decision will become a good chance for you. I'll be back from the business trip at the end of the month. Yes, sir. Tie up loose ends and let's start formally. Thank you, sir. I'll do my very best. You'll now only deal with the top 0.1% of Korea. Let's do well. For success! Yes, for success! Dammit... This constipation turned my shit into a rock! This is killing me. Hey, Jin-suk, Jin-suk! You really lost your touch. I feel terrible. At least make it look like you still work here. I got constipation because of you. I'm so busy, I can't help you there. But you know, you still have to report to your manager once in a while. Are you hiding something from me? If you're referring to some new porno, sure I got some. Yeah? Which race? All? Look, this ciggy is my first one in 3 years. If you don't answer me, I'll light this baby, got it? Take a drag. When you're stressed out you should smoke now and then. I decided to quit and transfer, so be a little understanding. How could you be a human and be so inhumanly cruel? Do I look like a chump? Listen to me carefully. Life is C between B and D, 'Choice' between 'Birth' and 'Death'. Stunning, such a powerful phrase. Why didn't you tell me about it before? I'll buy rounds at 3,000 Virgins tonight. You make all the choices. Keep 3,000 Virgins all to yourself. You ungrateful bastard, who stuck by you when you were tired and all alone in the field? Wasn't I the only one? Stop saying stuff like that, don't be so naive. This is business, it's a fiercely competitive market place. You take the offer instantly if they offer more. Take a drag and come down. Hey, Byeong-wu! I'm really going to smoke! You see this? It's lit, you bastard. It's here again. The magazine's here. What articles have you wrote this time? Take it easy with the intake, please? Hye-in, this isn't right. This doesn't look like the real thing! Too much retouching! Hey! What's this car? Ah, you know... I was scouted today. Today marks the first day of a new era for me. The man who scouted me today is absolutely the best in this field. Top 0.1% in Korea, that's who I'll manage personally. And where do we stand there? We'll work hard and be part of that group. Watch, I'll hit $1 million annual salary soon. What's the reason for hitting that? You know, to be happy. Can't we lead a simple happiness? Stop being so simple-minded, you'll really become a simpleton. Go hungry for 3 days, and see if you still think that way. If we have nothing to call out own, everyone will treat us like ghosts. We're nonexistent to them at all. Missy, is this non-smoking area? No, you can smoke here. Can't you be courteous? What are you talking about? Why so impolite to these young people? Then should I be impolite to the elders? Byeong-wu! What's with you these days? So, you won't answer my calls? Fine, fine, don't answer. Is it my loss? Hello, hello? Ah, yes Mr. Hwang. How are you? I'm sorry for calling so late. It's nothing at all. We are always ready for our clients, standing by 24 hours a day. What's on your mind? It's just, I don't know how to read this properly... Wanted you to give me a quote. A quote? A quote for the claim in case I die. Are you not feeling well? Is it... cancer? Nothing like that, like an accident, or... Sir, please, don't say that. As you'll know from reading the clauses, but there's no claim for intentional death. Then what other ways are there? Sir, why all of sudden... Then do you drink at all? Isn't this one the best? Isn't it? Mister, make it this one. - This one? - Yes. And I don't want that function that redirects you to the new number when you dial the old number. Sir, that's a free service. - No, don't do it, I don't need it. - Yes, sir. What if your clients are trying to reach you? I'm done with that, I have to disappear without a trace. The Truth Speak of the devil. Hello? Where the heck are you? You really want us to end like this? Jin-suk, the game's over. Then we go to extra innings. I'm changing this number so don't call anymore. Please activate it right away. It'll be done shortly. What? And you are? Mr. Hwang's family is pressing charges for aiding and abetting in his suicide. - Aiding what? - Aiding and abetting suicide. Either you didn't help as he died or assisted his suicide. So, you claimed to have met him that day, what did you two talk about? He wanted me to help him pull a claim estimate. That late in the night? What a pro! If a client is asking for you, does matter how late it is? And he didn't mention anything else? Well, he asked if suicide is claimable. - And? - And, what? I told him suicide is not claimable. Detective, this is really uncomfortable for me. How could you insist that I've assisted in a suicide when I have the obligation to answer my client's inquiries? Ultimately, the claim will be paid. But suicide should not normally pay out, right? He was drunk, and didn't you know he'd get the claim if he died drunk? Have you by any chance mention booze to Mr. Hwang? My father has never drank a drop in his life! He couldn't have known unless you told him! Let me go! Nowadays, you can get all the details when you look it up online. Shouldn't you have changed his mind when asked? Goddammit... Miss, do you think I'm a god? Isn't that right, detective? How could I have known he was going to kill himself? You could've said something warm to him... Hey Hye-in, Lee Hye-in! Hey! How could you leave by yourself! Dammit! Those people are so inconsiderate. How could they keep me for so long? Tell me the truth, seriously. Forget what you saw. The family should have thought of a better way to cope with it. What the hell is this mess? You seriously don't have anything to do with this? I said forget it. I'm so sick of this. Forget it, and let's go eat somewhere. You really won't tell me? Look, think about it. You think someone determined won't do it no matter what? He must've had a good reason for killing himself. Why have you changed so superficially? What? Hey, hey! Superficial? What's superficial? Do you know what superficial is? It's the articles that you write! Best body? Best face? Best, best, best! That's what superficial is! Whoa, one body per week. What, did I kill him? You treacherous bastard, you should be locked up. Stop with the bullshit, why are you all ganging up on me? Because of you! There will be an investigation. You want to see me get the axe? Those audits happen everyday, that's what they do. If you get a bad rep from this, how will you go on then? I don't care, let them do whatever. There's not a single dirt on my record. Even if I shake it like this? Not a single thing? Choi Bok-soon. I'm Jeil Life Insurance's Bae Byeong-wu. 23 months ago I'm Jeil Life Insurance's Bae Byeong-wu. I'm Jeil Life Insurance's Bae Byeong-wu. Hello, hello. Come on sir, performance is important too, but of course we can't sign people with suicide records. You know this, I'm disappointed in you. It's pretty obvious they're signing up to get the claim. Just look like we're going through the motion. Trust me. Trust what? Give me something to trust. Haven't I been doing that? I don't know about this... This is nuts... Jin-suk, you in here? What? You said you're quitting. Just wipe it and come out, we're fucked. Why are you still here, shouldn't you be elsewhere? You're fucked if I'm fucked, so come out now. What the fuck is it this time? Remember when I became champion 2 years ago? Yeah. At the time... I accepted applicants with suicide attempts. But the problem is... their suicide attempts are in the hospital records. Are we gonna get fucked over this? So, you're telling me to my face that you gave life insurance to suicide survivors? Are you crazy? You were pushing me hard to get that title, you said I had to get it no matter what. Did I ask you to go that far? How could you blame me for it now? We partied and celebrated because of it, and you approved the whole thing. Fine, what a greatjob, I'm so proud of you! Then have they been paying the insurance every month? I was going to push through the applications and cancel it right away, but I forgot. When's the final payment due? In 2 weeks. Could they really pay till the end and kill themselves? You know how crucial the timing is, can't you think of something? Think of what? Goddammit! You! Just do what I tell you from here on. What's your plan? Get you ass over here! Jin-suk! If the auditors catch this, you're completely fucked. Find those people and get them to change the plans on their own. Got it? Is there any water? Ma'am? Here. - Give me something smaller. - $2.50. What, why so expensive? Take it, this is the last shop on the hill. Ma'am, have you heard of someone named Choi Bok-soon? Choi Bok-soon? Yes. Ok-dong's mom? No, a woman named Choi Bok-soon. Ok-dong's mom is Choi. Go up that road a bit. Here. What is this? Don't have any change. How could a corner store not have any change? Just take it! How far up is it? Ah, hello. Is this Mrs. Choi's residence? I'm from the insurance company. Oh, is your mother here? - Mom? - Yeah. She's at work. - When is she coming back? - At night. - Kids these days... - Sis! What time at night is your mom coming back? - At night, sis! Sis, wait up! - What time? Kids these days... You live here too? If there's more behind you, come out at once. Tastes so good... Didn't know there were still places like this. It's gonna be a long time to redevelop. Hey, hey! Stop eating! Your mom has to see what I brought! You hear me? That's your last one. Who are you? Ah, Mrs. Choi? You must work for the sanitation. When my husband passed away, I was fortunate to get it. Of course... Making this world clean has to be a life-long vocation. It's a temp job. What was that... you wanted to talk about? Ah, right. The reason for my visit is... Mrs. Choi has been one of my most important VIP clients. I don't normally do this - with other clients... - Blow! But I'm here because you are a client I deeply care about. Neck. At this moment, you have a life insurance plan. I plan to change this to a retirement plan, and I want you to know exactly why. In this modern society, people live longer so such plan is valueless. Therefore, it'd be wiser to change it for your retirement. I don't know stuff like that. I'll sweeten the deal. If you change the plan, I will buy you a refrigerator with ice maker, and put it right there. Haven't I told you not to leave without him? Why do you not listen? Am I speaking gibberish? Change and wash up! Kids are kids, aren't they? What's this pill for? Depression? This is nuts... And why did this happen now? So irritating. Ah, you're Mrs. Choi's first daughter, right? Came out for a smoke? Give me your lighter. By the way, who are you? Ah, I'm... from the insurance company. I'm glad to meet you here, pass on something to your mom. I did a lot of research for your family, and instead of life insurance, a retirement plan would be much better. Do we get some money if she dies? Over 100 grand? Then I wish she'd die. If you're going home, please tell mom to change the plan. Fucking brat... I was foolish to never express myself You love the cold days, because you could see my breath in the air, you used to tell me, I was so happy then... - How could I forget you, - So good! - Everyone looked like you - Always one drunk asshole. Have a drink! Sir, she's in the middle of a song. What's with you? Customer is the king. A singer needs a drink for her voice. Yo! Are you giving me a dirty look? Is that the attitude towards the customer? Drink! One more round! Ms. Ahn! Ms. Ahn! Are you okay? Ms. Ahn! What the hell? Where are you going? Please stop! I just want a talk! Where are you running to! Stop chasing me! Ms. Ahn! Go away! Insurance, I'm from the insurance company! Are you okay? Why are you running away? I said I'll pay back the debt! What're you talking about? Don't you remember me? Who are you? I'm from the insurance company! Miss... I really don't have the time to enjoy a date like this with you. There. - Let's go home and have a chat. - There, there. Let me down here. - Here? - Yes. Miss? What a weirdo. Ms. Ahn! Where are you going? Ms. Ahn? - Come in. - Okay. Ah, you live in the famous camping car! Sit wherever you like. No wonder, a singer lives a romantic life... Wow, you can see the river. You probably see the monster all the time. Have you seen 'The Host'? Huh? - No problems today? - Who is that? Say hello. A pessimist who comes to collect money in case I die. - Hello. - Oh, hi. Out of Service Damn it... Deliver for #1806. #1806... Who is it? Ah, hello. Is manager Oh in? Is he in at the moment? He used to live here, but he moved. Ah, I see. Do you know where he... How should I know that? Do you know him well? - Um, a little. - Then pass on a message for me. I can't keep the mail for him any more. Or perhaps contact number for his family... I think they live abroad, that's all I know. So annoying! What's with the attitude... Took all the efforts to walk up 18 floors... Whoa, so stuffy and tight... Ah, I'm looking for manager Oh who lives here in room #10... Shit. Manager Oh! Manager Oh! That had to be the place, just around the corner... Watch where you're going! You got the wrong guy to hit! - Are you okay? - Manager Oh... Kim Young-tak, Ahn So-yun, Choi Bok-soon. Remember all these names? I'm in a pickle because of these accounts. Go find them and tell them to cancel their plans. I haven't talked to them in a long time... Wouldn't they be doing alright? Sir, when I signed them up, I only did it on your word. Why did you do that to me? I'm sorry, we're closed. Apply for life insurance? As you can see, I don't do that work anymore. Please leave if you aren't here for pastries. Did you put a knife to your wrist? You don't get the money right away if you die right afer applying. We'll find someone else, if it's too much. Wait, hold on a minute. Fine, since you've already made up your mind, let's see what's harder, living or dying. We all keep living because we can't die. Dying is extremely difficult. I thought 2 years would change them. At the time, that was the only way. I couldn't let them go. Sir, you're killing me here. The only thing that could improve life in 2 years is the military rank. You should know that. Life is harder than you think. Enough of this. We have to cancel their policies first. I could have you arrested for insurance fraud. But are you doing all right? I noticed you've moved. You know, it's always the same. At least have some of these, the tangerines look fine. It's good for your age. So tired... Why would Kim live here, of all the places he could live? And how am I supposed to find him? Wow... There really are homelesses here... This is a scene of life on the edge, I better work hard while young. Is there Mr. Kim Young-tak? Mr. Kim! Shut the hell up! Hey! Hey, buddy! You look normal enough, what the hell are you doing here? What is this? So cold... So cold. Buddy, if you want something to eat, go over there. There, go over there and line up. No special treatment, buddy. What the... It hurts... My arm... So cold... There, that's him! Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! Mr. Kim! So what I'm saying is... In Mr. Kim's case, it's more beneficial to switch to a retirement plan. Son of a! I'm sorry. - Are you listening? - Shit. Fucking son of a... Thank you. Mr. Kim, I'll treat you nicely, let's go eat somewhere else. This food is excellent too, thank you. Mr. Kim, where are you going? Can't we talk? If you change it to retirement plan, I'll send your family to Jeju Island. Or how about Phuket? I couldn't even go home last night so I can meet you. Hello. Do you have any work? There aren't any nowadays. Okay. Good bye. Bitch! Crazy bastard... Mr. Kim, do you want a water purifier? There aren't any work. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Kim, I really don't have time for this. Shit! Young-tak? You can'tjust go home. Let's get some coffee and talk, huh? We really have to work this out. I'm tired too, I need to go home. Bitch! Do people really live here? Young-tak, then what am I supposed to do? This is my nephew. Handsome fella, he'll be someone important. I meant, niece. - Oh, a girl... - Still busy at the factory? Yeah, all nighters everyday. Shit, bitch! I'm sorry... I love you, I love you... Are you sleeping okay? Yeah, there's even a bed. Want some food? I'll cook. You must've been startled. He's suffering a disorder. It's a tic disorder. Ah, tic disorder... Miss, the reason I'm here is... His is called Tourette syndrome, and it's gotten worse afer my husband died in an accident 2 years ago. Ah... The disorder must have some psychological problems. Does it? He just blurted out profanity lef and right. It's not that he wants to, he can't help himself. Bitch! Hope he gets better... I was speechless when I first heard it. He'd blurt out stuff like'S.O. B'. Damn... There's no easy answer. Where the heck am I? How is it going? There's no law saying people should die. You don't know what you're saying. It's a total mess. I might not survive this thing. Don't even kid about that. Jus how serious is it? Bottom of the ninth, 2 out. The real game starts at bottom of the ninth with 2 outs. Know what the problem is? You're the last batter. It's that bad? Hey! Just how bad is it? That bastard... Byeong-wu! Have you had dinner yet? $1 million annual income! Or you're a loser! You're a loser! Who the hell calls at this hour? It's still dark. - Sir, it's Sun-hee. - Is he coming? - Hold on. - What, who? Anyone home? Mister. Hurry, come over here! Mrs. Choi, are you all right? She's sick, she's boiling. Go fetch something to drink. What seems to be the problem? Hello? Yes, that's right. She can't go to work. She can't come to the phone either. Hold on. Mister, can you talk to him? Why should I take that call? Hurry up! Yes? Buddy, is Mrs. Choi that sick? Yeah, she doesn't look good. If she doesn't show up today she might get fired. Sir, Get off here? Yeah, hurry up! The shit that I have do, this has to be the worst... The sun will come up if you keep up that pace. I'm doing my absolute best here. Do we have to remove all these? We have so much more to go! I really don't have time for this... You must have weak stomach. These people don't know how to recycle properly. Byeong-wu, why haven't you taken care of that problem yet? Lawsuit and audit, I have so much to take care of! Please help me out here. Hey, Mr. Kim. - Come talk to me for a second. - Ah, you're here again. I really can't spend anymore time on this matter. Let's come to an agreement... Hey! I seriously can't understand you. If you change it to a retirement plan you can get unearned income regularly, so why would you not make that change? What if I die before then? Will it pay more than life insurance? Son of a bitch! Is that bastard really going for the insurance fraud? Hey, Mr. Kim. Looks like I'm 2 years older than you, can I be open with you? Sure. All right. When you work as part of a society, you meet people who are like brothers, we can be honest and open, right? And we become closer than real brothers. Isn't that right? But Young-tak, you have a home, sister and even a niece, why do you live like a homeless? What are you keep writing? A 'Thank You' diary. Son of a bitch! Uh, I'm sorry. Why are you writing it? Everyday I write 3 things that I'm thankful for. You should try it. Sure. I too have so many things that I'm thankful for. Overworked, and meeting new people, and becoming close with a homeless like you. - Crazy bastard... - How could I not be thankful? Right? And because of the stress from this thing, I lost 5kg. But why are you following me? I'm not following, you're just moving around so much. Go. I wanted to kill myself a lot, people looked at me like a nutcase. Sure, I had assumed as much. It must have been so difficult, that's what I thought. I knew you'd go through at least one or two difficult situations. I wasn't prying, but I couldn't help but notice the cut marks on your wrist, you must've tried to take your own life, isn't that right? I'm not crazy, it's a little inconvenient. Of course, I understand you. I know how you feel completely. - Ah, Byeong-wu. - Yeah? - I wanted to ask you... - Yeah, what? How big is the claim when I die? Young-tak. Hypothetically, strictly hypothetically, are you asking if insurance will pay even if you willfully take your own life, is that the question? Did I get that right? Yes. That's what you were curious? Yes, I wanted to know. Whether there'd be some money if you committed suicide? Yeah, will it be a lot? Forget it, you bastard. What a cheeky... Hey, Young-tak. Yes? Oh, the record button was pressed. I got a recording of you asking about intentionally killing yourself to get the insurance money. I got you asking just that. If you commit suicide, there's nothing. Not a thing, so don't ever think about dying. Take care. Look, you bastard. Can't you see these young folks? Live hard, run a business or something. Go to the market and get some merchandize and sell them on the streets. Live straight, and don't swear, you shit. Thank you, Byeong-wu! Pay it back! Bitch! That bastard... Sang-chul quit. And because of that, I want you to take these over. What are you talking about? I'm done here once I sort this out. Take over my ass. Even if you quit, do the work while you're here. Please do this for me. Take this... Look here. You never asked for my opinion, and you bitch and moan on your own. Watch your mouth! Anyway, just do it, for once do what I tell you. You prick. Oh Sang-yul Dammit! I am 'loneliness', I am the drifting cloud I am the aimless boat on endless sea You are 'longing', You are solitary lighthouse You are the single star in the vast night sky I want to love but you want nothing back It hurts me so much Okay, that's enough. Thank you for coming, next. Could I try once more? No, I think we heard enough. Why... do you want to be a singer? To make money. Next. And you sister? Should've called when you've moved. Kid, can you play guitar? Idiot, I'll teach you. Gimped bastard... If you're going to pick up chicks later, you need to play guitar and shit. Watch. Like the wind... I quit. Take it when given. Aren't you sick of running away? How can we overcome this predicament? Give me a little more time. There's plenty of time. But never any money. How old are you, So-yun? Answer when asked. Why waste such wonderful youth? At your age you could earn 30 grand in one month. Give him a call. I'll pay you back soon. Embarrassed about selling your body? But not about paying back the money? Is there anything other than whoring? Decide quickly. My patience is running out. Madame, could you give me a pack of smokes? Sure, sure. Thank you. Take this. What the heck is this? I don't have any change. No change? Then I have a credit card. Take it! How do you run a store without any change? Grab a big bottle of water. Give me a red ginseng drink if you're gonna give me something. Here, energize yourself. Red ginseng my ass. I'm gonna grab some popsicles! Hey! What are you kids doing here? - Selling herbs. - They're $3. Why sell them here? To help out mom. Where did you get them? There are tons in the mountain. $2.50! Does your mom know about this? Get rid of it, quick. She's not due back for a while. We have to sell more. Oh, hello Mrs. Choi! Ma'am, please calm down. I used to do stupid stuff like this all the time as a kid. Why are you keep coming around to mess with our affairs? Ma'am it's not that... Turn around! Haven't I told you not to do it again? Ma'am, I'll come back next time. Answer me! I'm sorry! Why do you keep coming here? Do I come here because I want to? Jin-hee, come in here. I'm so sick of this! Get back in here! You have to calm her down. Where are you going? Being poor pisses you off, and makes you sad, right? Even though it wasn't your choice? Mind your own business. You'll regret if your mom dies, so be nice. What would you know? Will you stop barking back to everything I say? Look. Look at this coin, look, look! Would it spin forever, like this? Living a life is all the same. It has nothing to do with you. Hey, you'll be in big trouble if your mom dies. Same for me too. Alright. Let's do it. Hey, Mr. Kim! This is all you can do with the money I gave you to start something? How much is it? How much did you get them for? Stop fooling around. How many have you sold today? One. Jesus... You'll become rich quickly. Any day now. Not a shred of business mind. Who buys these things when we all have alarms on our cells? But this is neon. Son of a bitch! Can't you suppress the tic even a little? Ah, is that to help you suppress profanity? You'll sell out because it's neon. You'll be rich! Oh, you're home? Give me $100. Where do you need that kind of money? I just need it. At least tell me why you need it so I can decide. I just need it! Why do you always talk like that to your mom? Shit, forget it! What the heck am I doing? Do you think it's easy for me to come all the way up here? You really are a nuisance. What is it? I have a favor. I'm the one with a favor. What? Lend me $100 if you have it. Lend you? And you're gonna pay it back? I'll earn it and pay it back! For what? To buy a tent. Tent? Are you going to leave home? My class' going camping and I'm in charge of the tent. You should've said you didn't have it, why be responsible for it? It's embarrassing! You know what embarrassing is? It's embarrassing when you don't change to a retirement plan. Mister, let's get spicy rice cake! But you already had some noodles! We're starving again! Starving? You ate noodles like there's no tomorrow just around the corner! - Blood sausage for me! - Dumplings! Let's go! Mister! What, are you done? Can we have fish cakes? Sure, eat everything while at it. Eat anything you want. Do you want some beer too? Go ahead and have some shots. Eat everything you want, you rascals! It should be in a cross. Come on! Are you sure this time? I'm sure, just hold them tight, got it? You've been slacking for a while. Mister, hurry up! Okay, it's almost done. You got that end, right? And we just need to get this up. Very nice. This really is comfy. Mister? What? Can we come in? Of course not. Girls are not allowed. Why not? Because I shouldn't be fooling around with little girls. Hey, hey, hey! - Sun-hee, right? - Yes. What's your dream? Um... Having my own study room. Always the dumb ones want a room. You're never in top 25 in class, right? When I was your age, I studied under fireflies' lights. So did you do well in school? What about your dream? I want us to live well. Listen carefully to what I tell you. I had three friends who were very rich. How rich? Outer walls were 100m high, and a lake in their front yard. Wow! But one of them died from overwork, another from car accident, and Sang-chul died of coition death. What's coition? Coition is... It's very complicated... It happens when two people love... It's not important! The point is, no matter how much you have, if you're not healthy, nothing matters. So you kids eat well, listen to your mom and be heathy. And you watch out for girls. Do you have a girlfriend? Of course I do. Tell us about her. I'm not someone who reminisces fondly. It's cold, let's go home. Let's just go home. It all started back in 2002... Bases loaded with no outs. To put it easily, it's a dire situation. Facing 3 heavy hitters, like 3 best students in your class. But they had nothing on me, they couldn't do anything against me. Tell us about your first love, not baseball. I'm getting to it! See you. Byeong-wu. Cause of a slump is one of two things: Booze or women. That is The Truth. Hello, I'm reporter Lee. Could I get an interview? Sure. How do you feel about hitting the game-winning home run? I'm just happy that my team won. You smashed Bae's first pitch, what was the pitch? He's simple, he only has the fast ball. Would it be okay to take a picture together? Sure. That son of a bitch! Excuse me, Ms. Lee. Ms. Lee Hye-in! Are... you an intern? Oh, #13 Bae Byeong-wu? You recognize me but don't ask for an interview. Didn't thought you were in the mood. If these things get in the way, how could you be a good reporter? - Shall we do it now? - Nevermind. Let's do it when I win next time. And if I strike out that bastard in the next game, could I invite you out to a dinner? Huh? You promise. I'm going to remember, alright? Ms. Ahn, it's your second bottle already, take it easy. Do you think... I'll succeed, or fail miserably? Fail, definitely. Why? The people who succeed are... Look at that. They don't think about how they'll die. Why? They have a well-defined goal in life! Know what I'm saying? Have some more. You don't know how your life will turn. Do you know who the worst kind of human is? Someone who kills himself and lets other suffer because of it. Can I drink one more? Why, gonna drink yourself to death? This is bare minimum. That's it, I can't do this! I knew this would happen! Forget it, I can't do this anymore! I don't care! Just sleep here! I'm gonna leave you some money. Stay here for the night, okay? I don't care, I don't care! I need to go home... I need to... You really are fated to die, snap out of it! Why am I tangled up in their lives... I told you not to drink so much, I knew this would happen! Home... - It's sad to leave like this. - How's kareoke? Kareoke? My treat? - Kareoke! Kareoke! - Let's go! Taxi! Hye-in, hurry up! Taxi! Taxi! - What are you doing? - Flagging a cab, of course. Who is she? I don't know her. Mister, let's go home. She says she's going home. You're coping with the breakup quite well. Hye-in, I can see how you could misinterpret this. If I were in your shoes, I'd take it the wrong way as well. But listen! She's a client and something bad happened to her, so I bought her some drinks, and she passed out. Client? Listen to yourself! Hye-in! Are you doubting me? You got this all wrong. Sir, I think you dropped this. If you use it too much, you won't get it up. Get what up, you punk! You are despicable... Hye-in, this is a misunderstanding! Mister, let's go home... Hye-in, this is for the breath, you know I don't need stuff like that. Let's go home... Walk home by yourself! Your sister's drunk. I'm so tired... Sir! What? Can't you sleep here? Are you crazy? Why would I do that? When she wakes up tomorrow, get her some tea! Sir. Yeah, what! I haven't got to talk to anyone today. Where are your parents? I can't remember mom, dad lef to make money but hasn't come back. When was that? We used to live at home but lef. Why? The scary men came by everyday. Must've been the loan sharks. You can't be at fault... How come you don't go to school? So-yun said the scary men will find us in school right away. But at least finish elementary school, it's compulsory education. Come here, I think it's ready. Have some. Wow, this looks so yummy! Just look at that! What the heck? You can walk around? So-yun said to use it because of the men. Damn, you kids really have it down right. If you're gonna eat, eat it properly. And you know, when those men come face them like a man. Can't hide forever. Shall I teach you some moves? If you always hide from them, they'll keep coming afer you. So you should confront them by stabbing their eyes, - and grab their heads like this. - Stop it! And just squeeze tight, you idiot. Just like this, you got it? Next time you see them, stab their eyes. Both eyes, like this. Bought some noodles so eat it. Don't drink so much, you crazy bitch! Take care of your bro. He could bring in a fortune one day. Why did you want to do this on such a cold day? I always wanted to ride one. Look, your sister's up. Row the boat too, you idiot. I made noodles for you. You row! Whose money bought it? Hey, crazy bitch! How come you don't show up for work? What are you doing? And nothing to show for. Took care of the lawsuit? Don't you see how serious this is? The company's in bad shape! Dunno... I don't know what I've been doing. Don't know what? You idiot! If you get fired like this everything you worked for is gone. Crazy bastard... When the audit starts they'll go for the lawsuit so get the paperwork right. I'll take care of it! Hello. There's nothing more to say to you. I came here to say something to you. You were right. We're not god, how could we meddle with life and death of a person? What I wanted to say is... Ma'am! Hey Byeong-wu! I'm gonna go home. Wait! I told you I'd drop you off, the driver's almost here. No, I'll just grab a cab. Don't be like that, let's go home and have another round. Forget it, I'm not in the mood. You're ignoring me because I live in a shitty apartment? Did you call for a driver? See? He's here. You're late, couldn't you get here sooner? Where is the car? It's over there. I thought you had a bakery, when did you start doing this? It's... been a while. Did you know I was handed over your account? But in this situation, I just don't know how to plan your life for you. Are your parents alive? How long does sadness last? You forget them in 6 months and the living keeps on living. Right? You're awfully chatty for a hired driver. My family too will live just fine without me. Can you please just stop your bullshit? I wanted to make them happy. It pisses me off that I never got to. Tell me, is there any hope for me? Fuck no! There's no hope! You'll die from exhaustion of working like this! I've calculated how much your family will get when you die, it's a considerable sum. They can get a 3-bedroom apartment, send kids to college, they'll be so happy. So go on, die right away! Yeah, just die, fuck, everyone just die. That's all you need to do... Shit... Hello? Where's my money? I just want the principal back. I don't have a single cent. Then what do you plan to do? I'm here to pay for my crime. Your crime? I'll pay in full. I did not work all my life to be defrauded by someone like you. Is this the attitude of someone repenting? Even if the world is so messed up, this just isn't right. Who cares. Who cares? That's all you've got to say? 'I defrauded, who cares! ' 'I stole, who cares! ' 'I killed, who cares! ' You motherfucker! Manager Oh! Manager Oh! Hello? Hello? It's daddy, Eun-sung. Hi Daddy. You can use Korean. Are you... Hang on. It's my dad. Cut it out! Can this wait? I have class. It's nothing. I'll tell Mom to call you later, I gotta go. Yeah, do that. I love you Daddy. Daddy loves you too. I love you. I love you... so much. Should I teach you to play guitar? You won't be bored when you're alone. Then should I play you a song? Passing of a difficult day Two under the moon, one shadow Happiness within reach, it's just right there My broken heart longs for the dreams of you, remember that the person you love is always with you The road may seem distant, tears flow down my heart, we'll be oasis for each other until it all becomes a memory Family Environment Survey Father: Absent, Mother: Absent Sa-rang. Sa-rang. What's wrong? Sis? Sis? Sis! Wake up! What's wrong? Sis! Hyuk! Hyuk! So-yun! Are you okay? Stay out! No! You can't stay here any longer. Stay away! It's dangerous! You might get the world record for being miserable, sir. Are you feeling any better? Byeong-wu, do you know which words we used the most to our clients? Happiness, wealth, hope, future. And family. But right now I have none of those. Sir, having hope doesn't cost a thing, why don't you try to have some? You know stats and probability are all useless. What then, huh? You live one day at a time, isn't that what we all do? A long time ago on a bridge, someone wrote a note because there were so many suicides: 'Let's think it over'. One day a man went there to jump but turned back. He saw that note and jumped as he had planned. Sir, was it easy to make that decision? Fuck! Why are you all fucking up my life! What do you want me to do? What am I suppose to do? Shit... There's nothing more I can say. What else can I tell you to change your mind? Thank you, Byeong-wu. Snap out of it, it's none of your business. I worked so hard to get where I am, dammit! Shit! Sir, just have one drink. I really can't drink. Let me just pour it for you. What would I know about life, sir. But even in the worst of times, isn't this life better than the next? Please let me be someone you can rely on, don't try to stick it out alone. I may not be a good friend, but nonetheless I'll be a friend. Thank you. Think about your family and do your best. Please pour me one too. Let's live hard! At least sleep at home. You'll tire yourself. It's so tight, how could I sleep there? Jin. Do you really want me gone? Yes. Jin-suk, Jin-suk! How is Young-tak's sister? What happened? Where have you been at this hour? Why were you late? What about Young-tak? He talked to the doctor for a while then just ran out. That bastard... By the way, the deadline was yesterday. It passed? It passed. Now the payment period has ended, and we're fucked if one of them dies. Stop saying stupid shit, no one will die! Can't you see we're in the ER? -. Hello? - Mister, it's Sun-hee. Who? Sun-hee? Yeah, what's wrong? It's me! Open this door! Mister, look. What is this? Is mom really going to die? - No, no. - You're bad, why did you tell mom to die? Hey, stop crying! Sit down. Jin-hee! Jin-hee, let's go find your mom. You know where she ofen goes right? Let's go find her. What if your mom really dies? She already tried once, she was going to die and leave us! Don't cry! Have you read the letter? What if she really dies? Stop being a brat! Come on, we have to find your mom, you can't survive without her! Let's hurry! Hey, stop crying! Let's go! Stop crying, your sister and I will bring back your mother. Wait here, we'll be back. Don't cry! Why are you just sitting there? Why? I've been hating you! I hated someone like you! But I'm sorry, mom. Sorry mom, don't go. I'm so sorry, Jin-hee... Young-tak, you bastard, if you die, I'll kill you... Kim Young-tak! Hey Mr. Kim! What are you doing there? Let's talk this out. Don't do anything stupid! Hello! It's me. What, what's with you? I just wanted to thank you. Why are you thankful all of sudden? You look like you work in hell too. Hey, hey! Don't say stuff like that! Where are you? So-yun! Where are you? Hey! Kim Young-tak, you bastard! Shit! Stop the train! Stop the train! There's someone underneath! He's under the subway! He's stuck! Come check! Shit, stop! He's under the train! Young-tak! Mr. Kim! Byeong-wu! Hey, Kim Young-tak! Why... why are you in there? I can't hear you! You son of a bitch! You bitch! I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! Okay, bye! Thank you, you bastard! Thank you for being fucking alive! Thank you, Young-tak, you bastard! Ahn So-yun... That crazy bitch. Okay, camera test. Very nice. Where did you learn to play guitar? I taught it myself. Why did you learn it? To help my sister when she's tired and lonely. Wow, let's all hear his half-ass performance. Ahn So-yun, stop moving! Ahn So-yun, freeze! What are you doing here? Come here! He's at least 10 times better than you! I'm going to sponsor him, I'm not kidding. Get down here! Why do you look like shit? Because of you! You're the one killing me. Hey, hey. Let me use your cell. I don't have any more minutes! - It's urgent! - Keep it short! Please... please... My Pumpkin Hello? Dad? Yes, Eun-sung, it's dad. Is anything the matter? Why is my baby calling? I just wanted to hear your voice. And sorry about yesterday, the class was about to start. It's okay. You don't need to use English now? Tell mom I spoke English, okay? Okay... But I can't lie so well... The chairman will arrive in 10 minutes. Ah, okay. Would you like some more tea? No, I'm fine. Hye-in I have something to tell you, let's meet. Stop kidding around. Don't even... 1 Year later He's so good! So talented, his music comes alive! If this doesn't work, we'll use our final option. What's that? Put it up on YouTube. Oh hello! Hi! - Had a good time? - Yes, we did. He's excellent. Here, school admission present. - You shouldn't have. - No, no, no. You're doing well? Ah, Mr. Bae, there's a good news. What is that? I became a permanent employee last week. Whoa, yeah? Congratulations! Then now you can change your plan to retirement plan. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - What is it? - Is to stick on somewhere? So annoying! Make sure to use it everyday, got it? I saw her smoking. You know, kids with their curiosities. Take good care of yourself, and keep in touch. - Thank you again. - So long! Good bye! You kids don't call me. Sa-rang's healthy? Yes! He's going to pre-school. Time flies, doesn't it? And you still swear a lot? I still can't get used to him swearing at me. Business doing well? This tastes great, you'll be successful. And when the business slows down, use your final option. What's that? The thing you do well. Jin-suk, show him what to do. For example, get your own water, you shit... No lefover, you fuck... Get that smirk off your face! - Would you like some more? - I don't want that shit. Foul-Mouthed Spicy Rice Cakes Foul-Mouthed Spicy Rice Cakes No credit, dammit! Foul-Mouthed Spicy Rice Cakes This is embarrassing. Life's hectic with the kid, isn't it? I really should have went to the bridge first... Why? Gonna think it over? Live a hectic life, it's short as it is just with love. Yes! Thank you so much. Forget it, buddy! What are you talking about, you have to earn every cent! Okay, double! Sure. Over the credit limit You really do live hard, huh? I learn a lot from you. Go on! I'll give it to you next time. Let's live hard! Byeong-wu! You really are a good friend. Your dream is my dream! Good luck! Good luck! There's a new pitcher on the mound, #13 Bae Byeong-wu is coming in. He's got a very fast ball. That's right. But his ball is sometimes unpredictable. Indeed. Runner on the first. #3 batter Park Min-suk is ready at the bat. Strike out! He successfully strikes out with fast balls. What a stunning speed. #4 batter Lee Won-joo stepped into the batter's box. Lee is in excellent condition today, He's having a great game today. Ah, the catcher wants to walk him. The catcher's going to the mound, what can he say at this point? Probably to calm him down. What's up, I really gotta take a shit. I don't want to let him walk. Just walk him! No bullshit! I can have dinner only when I get that bastard. Why are you having dinner with him? Remember the truth, you fuck. Come here, you bitch! Bae Byeong-wu! Here. Did you do that on purpose? From here on, tell me whoever bothers you. I'll cave his skull in for you! What shall we have for dinner? Is that your only concern? Is there anything else in life, we go on to eat and live. But shouldn't you go save him? Let's just go. He won't die so easily. Byeong-wu! You motherfucker! Bae Byeong-wu, what do you think about the suspension and $20,000 fine? No comment, turn that off! bSubtitle Rip; TheHeLL/b
