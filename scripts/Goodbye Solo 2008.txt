I saw how happy you were holding the baby in your hands just now. You know we love you. And you know that we want what's best for you. And I know you love us. You can't leave. Solo, you have to trust me. I wish you could trust me, too. And that's the problem. Quiera, you know I love you, and I'd do anything for the family. But I've always tried things your way, and you never gave my way a chance. And I wish you can understand that. I'm going to come back.

Two, check conditions and redirect when exits are blocked. Three, open exits and inflate slides. You're doing great right now. Four, when opening a door exit to evacuate an aircraft, rotate the handle in the direction of the arrow and open the door forcefully enough that it locks against the side of the fuselage.
