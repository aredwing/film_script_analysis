The ground revolves, as do the fielders. Bowler's screwed - since fielders are circling. Batsman's screwed too - as he won't know which gaps to place his shots in and fielders are super screwed...to run or to stop... A stupid idea of momentous proportions... mimagine in the first 15 overs, within the circle are two ying fielders... ...they grab the ball out of the air. Airport?

See, a hiccup is essentially an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm which causes sudden closure of the epiglott-is, which creates the 'hic' sound. And the remedy for that is to just let it be, but if it lasts too long, take medicines like maloperidol, nanoclopramide and orpromazine, which won't be in the car... There's another way... it's called the swimmer's remedy But you can't do this either, cause you are driving... HEY, HEY, HEY!!! ARE YOU CRAZY?!? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?! The 3rd method is shock...

When are you going to get some brains? You can't do one thing right! I can't get through to Kabir... Hurry up and leave Kabir... Leave the phone... Just hurry up and go! Yup... Yb! - What if Pappa sees her?! Do whatever you feel like with her... ...lock her in a room... or leave her by the roadside. I don't care! You're hurting me! - Just get in Vada Pav? Should we eat? I haven't had one in years... lam really hungry... I've not eaten anything since lunch... please! I am not going to stop even if you die of hunger! YOU are a CUFSE... ...the devil incarnate! Everything was set... I'd planned such a grand surprise... She would've forgiven me... but you've ruined everything! To hell with Vada pav... Why do you keep doing that? Are you going blind?! Where's Nikhil? Err... he... he's gone out... something came up The payment for the event has been made, yes? I can enjoy, yes? Only 5 Vada Pavs... please. Hello... Nikhil... Nope... He's gone to get Vada Pav... And who are you? He's come - Take this. Pappa...No No... I'll be there... Right away! Hello George... the car's stalled... Yb, I'll text you where... Give me money... I'm still hungry Heh... It's not opening? What did you think...we're out on a date in this rain? Shall I get you some wine?! We're locked in Meeta... Why can't you get it?! Move... you're blocking the light What's the matter? The battery's dead... - So, what next? AC to DC... If I charge it then... energy Do you have a laptop charger? - It's in the car... Do what you have to, I need to get back to the party! Yu P How will the battery get charged here? You're a Chemical engineer from llT... Then why did you have to steal and run? I needed funds for my project... Pappa refused... he thought I wanted to buy drugs... I had no other option Damn cool ya! Why don't I get such ideas? What did you do there all these years? From here I went to a University in China, for my PhD. 3 years later my PhD was over, and so was the grant... But the research wasn't. Sol borrowed funds from a private investor... and opened a lab where I am doing my research. And I've made this till now... This is what you've made after 7 years... Forget Pappa even I wouldn't give you money for this It's a high density polymer. The material's density is increased so much that. ...millions of molecules become one single molecule. This material then does not absorb any energy. It only reects. That's what this ball is made from and it will keep bouncing until.. It's stopped by an external force. I think your battery's charged... Dude, let's launch this ball at the cricket league opening ceremony... All the batsmen, will lose it! This ball can provide electricity For an entire apartment building For 24 hours... non-stop. Hey, Hey guys! Don't leave now... please stay na? Please... ya Just wait dude... I'm coming! Just wait! Hi! Just come with me for a second... I have a surprise for you What were you doing till now? I was dropping her off... I wasn't on the beach! What do I know... Karishma Karishma, just come for a sec Everything3 ready... please just come Please Karishma, don't go like this it's very embarrassing... You deserve it... Sorry - Be careful Open your fists like this... Now stretch... you'll feel good Like how kids sleep... with wide, Open arms... no baggage... stress free.. Kids don't suffer breaks ups... Exactly. Only adults complicate & stress their lives... like these tightly closed fists... What do you want? Please just do it... Breathe in... Breathe out Breathe in... Breathe out Karishma is never happy with anything I do... ...and then she'll break up... for any damn reason... sometimes even without one. Then why don't you break up with her? Is it some sort of a motto you sisters have around break-ups? We've have broken up regularly each month in the last seven years, like a mortgage payment. Many times I have felt like walking away... ...but fear that. ...she will not come chasing after me to cajole or explain... Why don't you try leaving her once? I don't want to leaver her! It only takes 2 seconds to leave... but what about the heartache that follows...? And what's the guarantee, that the next girl you meet will be perfect? So you keep breaking up, till you meet someone perfect?! Like animals... It's easy to walk away man... but to make a relationship work, there need to be adjustments... sacrifices... That's quite a pragmatic thought... But it's also depressing and unromantic. Tell me why have you come back? To steal... Steal?! Do it... Isn't it like this? You can do this also... Aunty c'mon... they're calling you Gargi, I can't find my necklace. What? Is Nikhil asleep? No Pappa! He must be around... You can't meet Pappa right now! Don't argue! You're not listening... Just go upstairs right now Nikhil... ...Everybody's waiting for Go upstairs, I'll come. What is she doing here? Nothing. What if Pappa sees her? Everyone is here! Don't worry. She's going. Gimme two minutes Hurry up... Everyone's waiting... Just come with me Just let me see Pappa once? - No! Stay here... You cannot come down. So, I need to lock you in. I won't come down... I trust Meeta... but I don't trust Meeta 2.0... your 'after-pills' version! What if I need to use the loo? Hold it... you're not a kid! The diamond necklace is missing. It's not where I had left it. I am sorry for yesterday... It's okay... Of course I am late, there was a ceremony at home... You brief Adnani, I'll just reach there Yb, don't worry... I'll get there Shit!... Salim... I forgot to wear my lucky trousers... I'll get there, okay. It's a necklace, not a shoe! I think I found Sita uncle's shirt under the sofa! How much was it for? Maa... what's happening here? The necklace is missing... Your Dad is investigating inside... Papa! Shit! Iam so sorry... I borrowed this saree from Gargi... I drink a lot of water... So... I couldn't control I'm really sorry... Hi...l'm here to see Mr. Adnani. Sure, please have a seat I'll call the manager. He'll take you in. Sir, 5O million is loose change For you... you've changed the fates of so many industries... Now please change our fates too... No, I can't give you money... Sorry... Why? Iam Mukesh Adnani. I have been a game-changer in Robotics, IT, Bio Tech, and what not... and you are begging me for 5O million? What game can you possibly change with 5O million? I don't want to be a game-changer... I just want to get married... and for that I need 5O million! I'll give the money. I should have it in a couple of days... Thanks but I don't want a penny from your family... I started a business to make Karishma happy... She is nowhere close to being pleased... But I've lost the little self-respect I had from this constant begging! You clearly hate what you do... o k3'! Actually you know, I... ...forget it Keep this a secret.. ...certainly from my dad.. I should've become a police officen. IPS Well become one now... You crazy? ...After seven years of attempted entrepreneurship, IPS seems good... Had I become a cop I may have liked to be a thief.. ...there's no guarantee on what the mind will like next... A guarantee in love, a guarantee in work, a guarantee over the mind.. ...might as well have been born with a guarantee card Now can you stay quiet. ...l have an important meeting and it is my last chance... Uh... Quiet! Just tell me... There are no 'last chances' only second chances! Mr. Nikhil... You're late by an hour. Yb... Sorry... traffic... Sir, just say yes and change our fates The meeting's in here...? If you'd come any later, it would've been in the shower room. Ssssir, please change our fate too... Hi Sir...Nikhil.. Sir I'm a huge huge...fan.. Its such an honour to sit with you sir... Sir I'm not here for 5O million.. I'm here to share an idea.. ...to change a game.. I'm sure you watch cricket? How was it played initially? A batsman would hit the ball, and if the ball were to get stuck in a tree, until the fielder returned the ball back to the wicketkeeper, batsman could keep taking runs.. Finally they introduced boundaries, so that matches could get over... ...started playing test matches.. ...when they got bored with that one-days. And today after 2O years 20-20.. ...but what after this? What are we going to do next? Next is what?! 1O overs cricket maybe? Correct but after that what? O-O is not a possibility ...so think for a minute.. ...what if I were to tell that the cricket field is a revolving disc... and within the 15 yard circle 2 ying fielders... ...who will catch the ball mid-air. Sir, imagine if I was the idea and you were the technology ...then our kite would soar high up in the sky! Don't you wanna know, how my meeting was? I know... you didn't get the money... How did you know? If you'd gotten it, you would've been on the phone... ...yelling & shouting orders... How do you know, that's what I would be doing... You are the oxygen to my double hydrogen... ...the chemistry between us ows like water... Sir, H2O Oh! Thanks! Ssir, this was our last chance... Salim!!! There are no 'last chances'- only second chances! Thanks. - mention not Me and Gargi had an argument today because, Cheers! I think she should cut her hair I hope Meeta is coming? Why? She's too much fun to drink with... But, what she is doing at the gate. Hold this... Hold on! Where are you going? I'm going home... - Why? I want to meet my Pappa... Can't you wait for one day... I haven't even seen Pappa, since I've come back... You can only look... Don't move an inch... And you can't have those pills Promise? Say it. Should I call Karishma Ma'am? NO... Madam's room is that side Pappa... Pappa... Pappa! Who -? YOU? What do you want? Can you come out for a moment? Come Pappa... One sec, come here... ya... What is it? I was driving by.. And thinking about the wedding seating arrangements ...where would I sit and where would Karishma sit.. ...nothing's finalised right? And you HAD to wake me up for this? No, no...l was thinking about how best to arrive to the wedding? Instead of a car how about on a horseback? Son if you so wish arrive atop a rocket ...just arrive at the right venue... Can I leave now? You're absolutely right Pappa.. I'm so sorry I woke you up, thanks... Done? Did you see him? What?! This big tree was in the way... and you'd said 'Don't move an inch' I can't go back in... please try and understand... Dude! What are you doing? Come back... Come back... Pappa... You're back... You wanna go outside again? No... upstairs? Come Na Pappa... Papa you are completely right... ...the parking lot will be overowing ...so where will I park my car? Which is why I decided I would arrive on horseback.. ...however I do see an issue with that too.. Papa imagine you were the horse and this... ya...here Here we park it - I'll fall down! Just a sec Pappa, behave like a horse Pappa... I won't ride you, don't worry! Just move 7O degrees... Er north-west Which degree? The horse will destroy everything... What're you doing Pappa?! No, No, No! Just come here... under the light... ya Watch out, there's horse-shit there! What're you doing Pappa?! If the horse is at the main door, it will chew all the owers away! You've woken me up so that we can play horsey in the middle of the night?! I think I'll just come on foot What's wrong Pappa? ls there a problem? No... I think I saw... Pappa... I'll take your leave? I couldn't find another angle... Let's go? Let's go? Karishma is not the right girl for you... ...get married to me... Okay. Pick one. Karishma... Anyway, I can never break up. I know... I know you'll never let me go and I will never need to run away from you... And there's no guarantee that you are going to be perfect?! I come with a lifetime guarantee...

Yu P And your project isn't complete...? And you had return the money, last week? YuP--- And so you're going to steal the money...? To put it simply yes, but... Can we please keep it simple? Why not ask Papa for the money..no need to steal then? Well, I asked 7 years ago... and he refused... I've somehow got a 3-day extension... If I ask him now, and he refuses... I won't even have the option to steal... Yup! Then run away... Last time it was China... this time, maybe Africa? I could... but... But what? Actually, they needed a guarantor for the loan... ...so at that time I forged the documents, and made Pappa the guarantor. And, he has no idea about it?! Nope... And those guys could come here and... What is this? Listen to me... You don't even speak Hindi! Pappa! - Pappa! Hey mummy! Do you have any shame? Should I be ashamed? Or should I save Pappa? Decide? Shut up! You fraud...! Now forge some more and steal from anyone else? Why does it have to be your own father? Coz, my father is my Pappa. It's against my principles to steal from others... Oh, now you have principles!... How much money do you need? 100 million. A 100 million? You mean 7 zeros... after '1' Er... 8 zeros actually Nobody keeps that kind of cash at home... especially your Pappa I don't need cash... I just need 2O minutes on his computer Computer? You'll hack your own Pappa's Account... Don't do that ya... So how much money do you need for the tender? 100 million... and I need it in the next 3 days Pappa... trust me... you'll not regret It... Your own family stands to get gain from this... You have no idea... this will solve everything... just... just give it to me. I don't get what does Karishma see in you! But, now that she has decided To marry you... what can I do I feed Prateeksha's husband and I shall feed you as well... Pappa, it's not like that... Then what's it like? First It was 5O million, now it's a 100 Million... See this is a large sum... I'll need the board's permission... It'll take time. Let it be Pappa... I'll manage it from somewhere else... Sorry for disturbing you... And I request you, please don't tell Karishma about this She already knows... she tells me everything... like the 3 million you owe her for... Pappa it's 2.5, not 3 million! This is the calculation... The house was for 3O Million. I took 2.5 from Karishma, And the rest 27.5 was paid by me Pappa? And it is THIS house, your daughter will live in... and when you have grandkids, they will live in THIS same House... So if you're losing sleep over that money, I'll return it to Karishma today itself! Hey... Mr. Groom! All set for the Dance at night? And... how's everything? All well? What do you want to know?!
