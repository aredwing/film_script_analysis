That's right, folks, it's too hot to sleep, too hot to work, and definitely too hot to make whoopee! (laughing) Aw, sir, I don't know about that. Mm, it ain't never too hot to make sweet love to your lady. (phone beeping) - Woman: Hello? - Hey, baby. - Hey. - I got some bad news. I am going to have to work a double tonight. Baby, that's the third time this week. I know, I know. But, hey, I rescheduled Demarco's on Saturday night. Yeah, that's good. Hey, are you at a restaurant? Yeah, I just walked into the ladies' restroom, - freshen up a little bit. - Sam: Okay, okay. I know this sucks, but are you okay with this? Not really, but what else am I going to do? God knows we need the money. I heard that. Well, I should be home before 11. It'd be real nice if you'd wait up for me. - Why? - Cause I just want to do some awfully sweet things to you, baby. How awful we talking? You remember Biloxi? Mm, I love it when you go bad on me, Sammy. Happy anniversary, baby girl, I love you with all my heart. I love you too. - I'll see you later. - Bye, baby. (phone clicking shut) (shudders) - Lola: Hey, Sam. - Well, hey there, Lola. How you doing today, girl? I'm good. I see Jimmy finally lets you out that office, huh? Yeah, I don't think that man likes me very much. The way I see it, you always gonna be working at that office, 'cause he likes looking at you. (groans) Yeah, you're probably right about that. (giggling) (phone vibrating) This is Samuel Dueprey. Oh, hey, how y'all doing? Good, good. Will they be ready for me to pick up by one o'clock? All right, I don't know, just something real pretty. Hey, chrysanthemums, tulips, they pretty? (whispering) Yes, yes! All right then, chrysanthemums and tulips, that'll do. Mm-hmm. Oh, hey, you got dark chocolates? Would you throw a box of them in there? Yeah, she loves that stuff. Today is our one year anniversary. All right then, Lucy, I'll see you around one, all right? Bye. I didn't mean to eavesdrop or nothin', but that is so sweet. Aw, well, thank you. I just hope Ashley likes 'em, you know. Oh, she will, your wife is a very lucky girl. Oh, she ain't the lucky one, she's just real pretty and sweet like pecan pralines. I'm the lucky one. Well, congratulations. Well, thank you so much, hun. Thank you, thank you. You're sweet, darling. Y'all got big plans for later? Well, we were supposed to go to Demarco's tonight. Nice. Yeah, that's real nice. She's been wanting to go there for a long time. We had a reservation, but I had to cancel it. Oh. With all they layoffs and what not, Jimmy's got me working a double, so... Didn't you tell him it was your anniversary? No, because I got my new truck, we just moved in a new house in Lakeside, it's a lot of money, you know? - I stay in Lakeside. - Get out of here! Yeah, just past the mall. - Sam: Really? - Lola: Yeah. Hey, Jimmy. (giggling) He's hitting that. He's tapping that ass. Look at 'em, they're flirting all the time, is that company policy? Tyrone, they're two types of men in this world. There's those who have jobs, and those who had jobs, now which type are you? I'm the have jobs. Sam: All right then, that's it for me. You have yourself a good day. All right, hey, uh, Sam? It's supposed to be a real hot one today, so try to stay cool all right? I hear you, darling, I'll catch you later. Bye, Sam. Is there anything I can help you with? Do you still have this unit? Let me see here. Now, we been selling this one like hotcakes lately. Bet you have. Well, it's two aisles over, on 12. Would you like for me to walk you over there? Are you always this helpful? You always wear that smile? At Southern Airlines we always wear a smile. Well, Miss Scott, it is my pleasure. Thank you, assistant manager Sam Dueprey. (truck engine roaring) (music plays over radio) Shit, motherfucker! (sighs) Son of a bitch. (children playing) (whistling) (sighs) (exhales) (sniffs) (phone beeping) (phone ringing in the distance) (moaning) (thudding) (moaning) (gun cocking) (screaming) - Wait, wait, wait, wait, no! - Woman: Sammy, Sammy! Wait, wait, wait, no! (gunfire) No, Sammy, Sammy! Sammy, no, no, no! (gunfire) (pained gasping) (footsteps descending the stairs) (sighs heavily) (guns clattering) (moaning) (screaming) Man: Oh, shit! Oh, shit, no, no, no! Uh-uh, motherfucker. Hey, there's no need for all that, come on, man. I'm so sorry, I messed up, okay? Don't hate me. Just, come on, man. Say something, go on, please. Sam, right? Isn't your name Sam? Okay, just I'm the first person to admit this. This is horrible, this is an unfortunate incident. It's very, very, I admit that. But there's no need for this to end in violence, Sam. I could just take my things and I could go. Sam: You know what? Why don't y'all sit y'all's sorry asses on down over here. Come on, man. Sam: Do I look like I'm playing? Sit your ass on down! Fuck! (heavy breathing) (clattering) Happy anniversary, baby. (weeping) You're ripping my heart. (crying) You're breaking my fucking heart. Please try to forgive me. What? What'd I do wrong? I make enough money. I work too much, god damn it, woman, what the fuck did I do? I need some answers. Let's start with you, Punchy. How long you been fucking my wife? Why you gotta do this, Sam? I ain't talking to you. You know what this is here? Metronome. As you know, this here is supposed to help you keep time. It ain't never really worked for shit, though. I used it to put me to sleep. Thing is, this here? It's gonna put you all to sleep. (metronome ticking) Cause when this here stops beating, if I ain't got my answers... (imitates gunshot) Game over. I'm waiting, Punchy. What you wanna know? I wanna know how long you been fucking my wife! Okay, I'm working with you, just... Sam: Answer the question. Maybe you need yourself a drink, huh? I can understand that. Well, go on, I already know where your mouth been. All right, that's enough. Give it back. Come on. Well, I'm waiting, Punchy. The peaches and I met about six weeks ago. Ya'll been fucking for six weeks? No, no, no, it's not like that. It's not like that. We only been intimate about a few times. Oh? Just a few times, huh? That's it, man. Sam: Just a few times, huh? Yes, it was just a few times. So about many times we talking, hmm? More than two times? I don't know. How many times did you fuck my wife, God damn it! It was like, three or four times, like three or four times, Jesus fucking Christ, man. - Just let me... - Sam: See? Now we getting somewhere, cause now we communicating. You always fuck her in my house? In my bed? All but the first time. First time was a hotel. Stop this, Sammy, please stop. Woman, I am a fuse that is fixing to blow. You do not interrupt me again. You were saying? I don't remember. Well, it was something about you fucking my wife in a hotel, I do believe. Yeah. First time was in a hotel. How'd ya'll meet? Online. Online, huh? "Oh, don't worry, Sammy, baby. I'm just reconnecting with old friends from my high school." You remember that fucking load of bullshit. Hmm? So, tell me, Punchy. Did you go to high school with my wife? God damn it. I blame myself for this shit. No, Sammy, baby. It ain't your fault. I'm just, I'm messed up. What happened next, after you and my wife became internet friends? Oh, shit. Are you married? Yeah. How long? Ten years. Ten years? Yeah. You got kids? I got a little boy. My wife got a girl on the way. Well, congratulations, Punchy. See, I reckon, being married don't mean shit anymore. You see this little band of silver here? Just a god damn cosmetic, ain't it? (metal crunching) (weeping) Why don't you finish telling me about you and Peaches. We met up one night. One thing led to another. That was the first time. How was it? H... How do you mean? I wanna know what it was like fucking my wife. Sammy, please stop. I can't take anymore. I got news for you, baby. We just getting warmed up. We ain't even got to the good part yet. Continue. It was okay. Just okay? Motherfucker, I know for fact it's a whole hell of a lot better than just okay. Fine, it was great. That what you want me to say? She got some real good pussy on her, don't she? So, tell me. Did you ass fuck her? Come on, man. Did you fuck my wife in the ass? Yes. She like it? I don't know, you can ask your wife, I guess. Yeah, you been having yourself a good ol' time with my wife, ain't ya? She suck your cock? She do that little thing with her tongue? You know what I'm talking about. Mm, oh, yeah, Peaches. Oh, Peaches got a mouth on her, don't she? (murmuring) Seems like your memory ain't so good, Punchy. You know what? I might just help you jog your memory. Hey, there, baby girl. Seems like your boyfriend can't remember whether or not you give good head. Why don't you get on over there? Remind him. (whimpers) What? Fuck you, Sammy, I ain't doing that. Oh, yes you are. No, Sammy. You're just gonna have to fucking shoot me. Well, then I guess this is goodbye, then. Peaches: My god. Sammy, you're really gonna shoot me? What you think? Come on. On your fucking feet, Punchy. (sobbing) On your feet, Punchy! This is fucking sick, man! Is that how you get off? Look at the bright side. At least you still breathing. Both of you. (crying) Go ahead, there, sweetheart. Just pop it on in your mouth. Just pretend like I ain't here. You know. Like you did before. (sobbing) Yeah, you like that? (phone ringing) Baby, that's probably my boss. I gotta get back to the restaurant, he ain't got nobody covering my shift. Well, you shoulda thought about that before. Keep at it! Don't stop! Get on in there! Hello? Yes, this is her husband. Oh, she done decided that she ain't coming back to work today. Oh, no, sir, we... We kinda in the midst of a family crisis. Oh, no, no, no, no. Everything's gonna be just fine. Just fine. Okay, bye. Is it all coming back to you now, motherfucker? Hmm? Yeah. You made your fucking point. She can stop now. There, there, Peaches. Drink up. You know, I read this article the other day. Now, they did this study at one of them fancy universities. Apparently they found out that swallowing cum makes women happy. You happy now, darling? You can thank me later. (ticking) A few nights back. Can't sleep. So I'm watching this old show with De Niro. Can't remember the name. There's this part where he picks this fellow up in a taxi. Fella tells him to drive him to this apartment building and just park. He don't get out. Just keeps the meter running. Fella then says that this ain't his apartment building. But the half-naked woman standing in the window, that's his wife. Fella then says, "You know who lives here?" Niro don't answer. Fella says, "A nigger lives here." He then went on to talk about how he's gonna kill his wife. He said, "I'm gonna kill her. I'm gonna kill her with a 44. magnum pistol. You know what a 44. magnum would do to a woman's face? It would fucking destroy it, just blow it right apart. Now you know what a 44. magnum would do to a woman's pussy?" I gotta say, it's pretty fucking disturbing. It got me to thinking, though. What would I do? I mean, I got me a pretty powerful gun, too. I ain't imagine I'd be answering that question so soon. Now, you know I ain't never raised my hand to no woman. This situation you got me in, it's taking everything to keep me from squeezing this trigger. (gun rattles) Ya'll have no idea how bad I wanna watch ya'll bleed. But you don't have to, baby. We can work through this, okay? I messed up real bad. But I love you. Cross my heart, I do. I believe you still love me, too. God, Ash, I wanna believe that I ain't got it in me to kill a motherfucker. I really do. The way I'm feeling right now? I'm damn near capable of anything. Taxi Driver. What'd you say? That's the name of that movie you talking about. Taxi Driver. Who the fuck are you? - My name's... - Shut the fuck up! Black American Express card. Shit. Platinum MasterCards. Damien Dexter Jackson. Shit must be nice. I ain't never been able to qualify for no platinum nothin'. Let's see what else we can find out about the man that's been fucking my wife for six fucking weeks. God damn, Punchy. This a whole lotta walking around cash, huh? Ooh, ooh. You a drug dealer or something? Hmm? You a fucking drug dealer, motherfucker? Of course not. Motherfucker, are you paying my wife for sex? No, I'm not, that's ridiculous, man. - Ashley: Wait, wait... - God damn it, Ashley! Wait, wait, wait, baby, it's, let me explain... Is he paying you for sex? No, it ain't like that. It's a loan, okay? A loan for what? Baby, you know how you're always going on about wanting a new guitar? Well, they were having this huge sale at Old Timers, and I was fixing to get you a new one as an anniversary present, okay? But I was just a little short, and so, you know, I just wanted to do something to make you happy. But I ain't never borrowed money from him before. I pl... I planned to pay him back. How you gonna pay him back? With his dick in your mouth? I know you're real angry now, but you ain't gotta be so god damn mean. I got a raise coming soon. I'm gonna pay him back. I just wanted to do something real nice for you, Sammy. Don't you fucking move! (breathing heavily) Fuck, Ashley, fuck the god damn guitar! All I ever wanted was a good woman. Oh, I'm good. I'm good, Sammy. I'm good, baby. You earned it. USAF Major. Damien Jackson. You in the service? Got out a few years back. I'm a reservist, now. So I guess you're used to having a gun pointed at ya, huh? I don't think you ever grow accustomed to somebody pointing guns at you, no. But that wasn't my experience. I flew jets. Like, Top Gun type shit? No, bombers. Don't tell me you flew the B-1. Yeah, actually, I did. Stationed not too far from here. Barksdale? That's the one. Oh, man, I grew up in Bossier City, right near that base. I didn't know that, Sammy. You know, kinda makes sense that you were a bomber pilot and all. - How's that? - All you flyboys, all ya'll do is drop your bombs from way up in the sky. And then run off and hide in them clouds. Leaving a mess for everybody else to clean up. That's not quite how I'd put it. I got news for ya. This time, you gonna see the mess firsthand, Punchy. (metronome ticking) So, uh, they give you one of them nicknames? Tactical call signs, what it's called. Flash Jackson. People just call me Flash. Flash. (snickering) Said you fly for Southern? I ain't never seen no nose ring wearing, tatted up airline pilot before. I guess Peaches just needs to get herself an upgrade. I wanted to be a fighter pilot once. Took that damn ASVAB test a few times, but I couldn't score high enough to get into the Air Force or the Navy. Just guess I'm not smart like you. You're still relatively young, you know? It's not too late, I mean, those things are all political. I didn't know you wanted to be a pilot, Sammy. Well, I guess there's a whole lot that we don't know about each other. Peaches. Damien: Sammy, I mean, if that's something that you're still interested in, I can make a call, I mean, there's people that owe me favors. You'd do that for me? I would, I really would. No, thank you. You ain't talking your way outta this shit. (ticking) What's your wife's name? I'm gettin' real sick and tired of repeatin' myself. Jasmine. Sam: Jasmine. That's a real pretty name. What's wrong with her? Nothin'. She's great. So, why you fuckin' my wife? What would Jasmine say if she were here, right now? Probably be pretty pissed. Would she leave you? Probably not. My wife knows I got a problem, and we're working on it, I'm trying to fix it. Oh, I don't give a fuck about what you fixin' to do. It's what you done already did here, that you're gonna have to pay for. Damien: Look, God damn, Sam, we're all grownups, okay? I didn't force your wife to fuck me. It was mutual. And it was wrong. And I am sorry. And obviously your wife is sorry. And you're mad as hell, and you have every right to be. But Sam, this is life. This kinda shit happens from time to time. You just gotta pick up the pieces and learn from this shit, man, and just move on. I ain't no marriage counselor or nothin' like that, but I mean, I think it's plain to see that this is between you and your wife. I mean, with all due respect... What you think you're doin'? Sammy, Sammy! God damn it, Sam! This is gettin' ridiculous! Either you fucking shoot me, or you let me go! I'm not gonna just sit here and be humiliated by you. You come to my house, and you fuck my wife on my anniversary, and you talking about humiliation!? Didn't you know something like this could happen? I fucking did, man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you guys, I never meant to hurt you, man. Oh, you hurt people. And hurt people, hurt people. (metronome ticking) You read The Bible, Sam? Yes, I do. You? I wouldn't call myself, for lack of a better phrase, like, all Christian or nothin' like that, but my momma took me to church every Sunday. Every Sunday, and I think some of it rubbed off on me. I remember hearing that vengeance belonged to God. Vengeance only perpetuates more vengeance. And on again, and on again until somebody just has the strength to say stop. "The wrong done to me, I will not avenge." Does that sound familiar to you? "Avenge not yourselves, give unto wrath, for it is written that vengeance is mine! I will repay, sayeth the Lord." Romans, chapter 12, verse 19. See, this here? I don't see this as revenge. Revenge would be me going to your house and fucking your pregnant wife, until she could hardly breathe. This? This here is justice. And I do believe the good Lord will be on my side. Exodus 20:13. Boy, heathen, (metronome ticking) you should do know your way around the good book. But it's Exodus chapter 20, verse 14 you gots to worry about. See, ya'll keep saying ya'll sorry. But you ain't sorry. You only sorry that you got caught. It's time that ya'll deal with the consequences of your actions. I got some money. Everybody's hurting for money these days, right? I mean, what you need? A thousand? Five thousand? Just name your price, man, just don't take my life, I got a fuckin' family, please, Sam. A hundred thousand. That's more difficult, but I can get it. I can get you that money. I have to call my banker, I could have him wire the money tonight. He could wire the money tonight. I just use that phone, I get you that money. Just let me use that phone, I'll get you that money. Get your ass back, motherfucker! Come on, man. You think I want your money? Huh? You can't buy your way out of this shit. When you dipped your dick into my wife, you stole something from me. You took a piece of my pride. Every time I look at her, I'm gonna see you. - (whimpering) - Sam: Huh? (crying) Now, tell me. What's the penalty for that? Damien: I don't know! What's the price for that? I don't know, but it shouldn't be death. Well, fortunately, the good Lord is on my side. You see, the good book says, any man who commits adultery shall be put to death. Leviticus, chapter 20, verse ten. Ashley: Baby. Baby, put the gun to me. Come on. It ain't his fault. It's my fault. I'm the bad one. Good, good, good! Okay. Talk to me. Talk to me, forget about him. Talk to me. Go on, Damien, get out of here. - (gunfire) - (screaming) God damn it! The fuck is wrong with you, man! (sobbing) Ya'll just don't seem to understand. Gonna point this out for you. I am judge. I am jury. And I am the executioner. So whoever dies here today, it's my choice. (metronome ticking) Jimmy: How's it going? Lola: It's going. I haven't seen your boyfriend in a while. He's not my boyfriend. Sammy's a happily married man. He's married? (laughter) - Happily. - Yeah. Where is he? I don't know, haven't seen him since just before lunch. He better not still be at lunch. Well, when you see him, tell him I'd like to have a word with him. Sure thing. And, uh, when you're done here, I'm gonna need ya over on aisle seven. No problem. You're doing a great job, Lola. You keep up the good work, you're gonna go places in this company. Okay, thanks. Sam: You always cheat on your wife? Or you'd always fuck other men's wives, what is it? I didn't lose my virginity until I was 18. I had to pay a hooker for that. I married the first girl that actually liked me for me. Probably got married too early. I don't know. That's a touchin' little tale you got there, but I still see you as a self-absorbed asshole. Damn it, Punchy. (keys jingle) What you doin' with two phones, Punchy, hmm? One of 'em's your throwaway for the whores, isn't it? Bet you your wife ain't got that one, does she? Wonder which number you got. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) Look at that, Peaches. Look at that. Now you know what he thinks of ya. Just one of his little whores. You think you got it all figured out, huh? You got everythin'. Guess that this ain't enough for some folks, though, huh? You got all them nice things. Is that what my wife is to ya, huh? She's a friend. She can't be your friend. You don't even know her name. I know when ya'll first met, she was married. I also know when you started fuckin' her, she was still married. I know what you're thinkin'. We the same. That loser used to beat the piss outta her. I saved her. That marriage was over when I came into it. Why, 'cause you say it was? Tell him, Ashley. Tell him I saved you. You did, Sam. Yeah, he did save me. He did. No, we ain't the same. Yes, you are. I am not like you! He beat her! Damien: And that's horrible. I mean, but the state of Louisiana says she was still married. This makes you an adulterer, Sam. Just like me. No better, no worse. You gotta accept that. We the same. You can fuck with my life, and you can humiliate me, you can hit me. You can even kill me. But it ain't gonna change the fact that you are me. Probably never'd been together if you hadn't fucking run on your old man. I just, I couldn't help it. I just couldn't stop thinkin' about you. I couldn't. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't do nothin'. I couldn't even think. And I always felt like you felt the same way about me. (crying) I do, Sammy. I do. I did this to myself. You know, my step daddy, he was a dumb shit, he didn't know much, but one thing he did always say was that a leopard can't change his spots. That's one thing he was right about. We are what we are. And that's that. (metronome ticking) And you got so many women in here. Why'd you have to take my girl, too? Fuck it, man. You're gonna kill me anyway, I'll tell you the truth. Because I could. Ashley: God damn it, Damien. Why'd you have to say that? Don't you see what this is doing to him? What it's doing to him? He's got the fucking gun. Just stop! You know, I'm getting real sick of people like you. The takers. All ya'll do with your money and your smarts, you take advantage of the weak and stupid. I got news for ya. I ain't weak. And I ain't no idiot, neither. Oh, Sam. You're the judge. You're the jury. And the executioner. You know, you smartass motherfucker. Did you grow up in Mandeville? Go to Trinity Prep? You one of them motherfuckers over there? Hollygrove. Sam: Hollygrove, huh? You ain't nothin' like them folks. I work with some of them folks. Coming from you, Sam, I take that as a compliment. No. They different from you in a really good way. Them folks is decent. Them folks is God-fearing. - They ain't like you. - (Damien tuts) You really come up in Hollygrove? What is that, just something you said to my wife? So you'd get close to her and fuck her? It's not really something I'm proud of, so, no. It's not something I say for women to fuck me. I came up hard, Sam. Real hard. You ashamed? Well, you might be too. I was that nerdy kid. Some cheap-ass glasses that everybody picked on, got his ass kicked a couple times a week. (scoffs) No big brothers, no cousins, no family. No friends. Nobody had my back. Just me and my momma. And she was 16 when she had me, so... You know, we just had to look out for each other. She did what she could. What about your daddy? He's a weak fuck. He was a piece of shit. Fucking coward. They said they'd say to him he was like a, he was my momma's high school teacher. (thudding) She wasn't a whore, though. She was just confused, you know? Got taken advantage of. He had family across town, so, he, know, what about her, basically, right? But my momma did fine. (phone buzzing) - Sam: Hello? - Hey, Sam, it's Lola. Sam, are you okay? You don't sound right. No, no, it's gotta be the connection. Okay. Well, Jimmy's looking for you. When you coming back to work? I... I'm not sure. I had a home invasion. Oh, my God, is everything okay? No, it's not, but it's goin' to be okay. What should I tell Jimmy? Just tell him I'm not coming back to work today. Tell him I got a critter problem I'm dealing with. - A what? - Sam: Critter problem. This real big motherfucker got up in my house and just made a mess of everything. Oh, my God, what is it? Not sure. But I aim to kill it. Lola: God. (chuckles) Well, I'll let Jimmy know, but, you really should give him a call, though. Okay. Hey, Lola. Thank you. Lola: No problem, Sammy. Just call me if you need anything. Okay. - Lola: Bye. - Bye. (phone beeping) (crashing) No more fucking interruptions. Gotta pee. Sammy, I've gotta pee. Then go on ahead. The hell do you think you're doing? You said go ahead. Are you gonna make me pee myself, right here? Now you got a pot to piss in. (thudding) Play with dirt, you get dirty. Call your wife. Can't do that. (gun cocking) Call her. She's pregnant, no, she's two months pregnant, I don't wanna lose the baby. Sam: I ain't worried about your excuses. That's somethin' you just shoulda thought about before you started fuckin' my wife. I want you to call her. Put her on speaker. So I can watch you tell her what you did to me. (ringing) Hey, honey. Hey, baby. Jasmine: Are you on your way home? Yes. Is everything okay? No. Jasmine: What's going on? I ran into a little trouble on the way home. What did you do, Dame? Who is it this time? What I'm trying to tell you, baby, is, um... What he's trying to say... Shut the fuck up. Who is that? Oh, my God, was that a man? What are you trying to tell me? Well, Jasmine, this is Sam. And, uh, what your husband is trying to say is that right now I got a gun pointed at his head. Cause I came home and caught him fuckin' my wife. Say hello, Ashley. Hello. Dame, please. Please tell me this is not true. I fucked up 'cause I'm fucked up. You promised me that this would never happen, and I thought we were fine! I thought everything was... (weeping) Fucked up, I'm just fucked up. Do you love her? Course not, baby, it's not like that. Is she the only one? No. But, if I make it home, you're the only one in my heart. I'm a changed man, baby. Sam: Well, Jasmine. Trust me when I say, I understand this must be a real hard time for ya right now. So I'm gonna let you in on this. I can either shoot him, or I can send him home to you. You decide. Baby? Take me off speaker. Hi there, Jasmine. It's just you and me now. Uh-huh. Really? Okay. Bye. Do you even love your wife? Of course. She's my partner. But do you love her? You gonna soon find out, love ain't got a lot to do with marriage. It's a contract. Sacrifice and compromise are much more important. Love ain't shit anyway. I just don't know who's more fucked up, you or your girlfriend, Peaches. Damn it, Sammy, stop this. Let him go. You and me, we've got the real love. Let me kiss that pain I bring on you away, baby. Come on, we can fix this. Sammy, look at me. Look at me! You know, you might be right about marriage. But love? It's like a cough. Can't stifle it out. You just gotta go where it take ya. Do you love your wife? Jimmy: Sam? Hey, Sam, it's Jimmy again. I've left you three messages already. You best call me back, son, or you ain't gonna have a job waitin' when you get back here. You know? There's two kinds of people in this world, Sam. Those who have jobs, and those who had jobs. You can take that to the bank. (phone chiming) Oh, looky here, Punchy. Somebody got themselves a text message. Give it to me. Oh, no. I'll just go ahead and respond for ya. Go fuck yourself. That don't matter no how. You ain't got much longer to live. So, tell me. How many men did you fuck when you was runnin' around on your ex-husband? I don't remember. Ballpark it for me. (phone chiming) Hah, looks like I made myself a friend. You were saying, darling? - Something about how... - (knocking at the door) I wonder who that could be? Well, hello there, Jasmine. Missed you, Sam. Sam: That's right, join the party. Damien: Oh, my God. Baby, I'm so happy you're here. I know I'm a complete fuckup, but thank you. Sam, thank you. You sure you still wanna do this? Yes. I'm done being the victim. - Damien: No. - Ashley: No. - Damien: No! - Ashley: No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Damien: No, Sam! Sam, you made your point now. God damn it, Sam, you made your point! Taking this too far, Sam! You made your, you made your... (Sam groaning) Your god damn point! (weeping) Baby, what are you doing? Baby, what are you doing? What the fuck, baby! What are you doing? Fuck! - Fuck, God, fuck! - (thudding) (hysterical crying) God! (screaming) (grunting) Why? (weeping) Sam: Now, when you leave here, how do I know you ain't gonna call the cops? I don't care what happens to him. He's dead to me. I was never here. Ashley: Fuck you! (yelling) How's it feel? Ashley: Fuck you! Now that, that was just sex. How ya'll gonna tell me what ya'll got is just sex? - Hmm? - Yes. I don't love him. But he knows you. He knows things about me. I don't know why I did it. I don't know. (weeping) It was just different, it was different. 'Cause you I made love, with him, I don't know, it's some sort of fantasy sex, or something. Fantasy sex, huh? If that's all you needed, then why didn't you ask me for that? Any fucking kind of sex you wanted to have we could've had! All you fucking had to do was ask! I ain't a whore. Oh, you ain't no whore? I ain't a whore. Here you are, sitting on a bed naked, across from a man you just got done fucking. That ain't your husband. Tell me, what do we call you, then? I don't know. I don't know. I always had a tough time being faithful. But when I met you, God, I tried to fall in love for the first time, I mean, I wasn't even interested in other boys. How can you even say that? You just got done fucking another man, on our God damn anniversary. I need a cigarette. You know there ain't no smoking in this house. I don't know. Shit, maybe ya'll fucked up right now, but we're gonna still try to abide by the fuckin' rules. Cause this is my God damn house. Okay. - Sam: You remember that time, - (ticking) I pulled that Remington on your ex-husband down by the lake? - (Ashley chuckles) - Sam: Hmm? How could I forget? He was so scared of you. He never hit me again after that. Sam: I've done so much for you. I even adopted your daughter to keep that piece of shit away from you. All for nothin', huh? I probably deserve to die. For treatin' you this way. I'll do anything to make it right. Anything? Anything. All right. I want you to take this revolver, and I want you to go shoot your fantasy lover. In the fucking face. That's what I want you to do. Are you serious? We can end this nightmare right now. We'll tell the police that he tried to break in and rape ya. We can just call that self-defense. What you think this is? Florida, motherfucker? Or how about we don't even call the police? We just bury him back in the garden. Under the roses. You gonna do it, baby? (kisses) Prove to me that you are not quittin'. Just shoot that son of a bitch. Hmm? There you go, baby. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now, Peaches, think about your life, okay? Don't let him ruin your life. Aw, yeah. Don't let him ruin your life now. He's drunk. He don't know what he's saying. My name is Ashley. Okay, Ashley, stop. Just think about your daughter. Think about your daughter. All you gotta do is squeeze that trigger. (whimpers) - Fuck him. - Sam: Come on, baby. Fuck me, think about your daughter. Sam: Just give her a squeeze. (whimpers) Listen, listen, Peaches, Ashley, look at me, Ashley, look at me. Look at me. Sorry, Damien. He gonna kill you anyway. - (gun clicks) - (screaming) That's what I'm talking about. Give it to me, baby, give it to me. Now, go on, go on, sit down. Sit down. We might just get back together after all. (laughter) See that, Punchy? You got no fuckin' clue what we capable of. You're right, I don't. I really don't. But you don't even know who you are, Sam. I had a therapist once. Said we spend our entire adult lives trying to get over our childhoods. What the fuck happened to you? His momma did the same thing. And I guess you must've married your daddy. No. I didn't marry my daddy. You remember how I told you my daddy died when I was in high school? He died six months ago. Why would you lie about something like that? Did he touch you funny or somethin'... No, he just let it happen. My daddy was a hardworking man, who just loved his job. His boss, Mr. Beaumont, he just wouldn't promote him. And my school was next to my dad's office. And after school, I'd go over there and I'd wait for him, and one day I met Mr. Beaumont and... He seemed real nice. He kept talking about how pretty I was. And that I could be a model or a movie star. I'll never forget the look on his face when I told him who my daddy was. After that, every time I came around Mr. Beaumont and Daddy were best friends. (heavy sighing) And then one night, Daddy had to work late. And Mr. Beaumont offered to give me a ride home. It was raining out and there was... There was lots of traffic. So I, I dozed off. And when I woke up, Mr. Beaumont had his hand up my skirt. And he was trying to put his finger inside of me. And I screamed. He said, "Relax." That he was gonna make me feel like a real woman. He finally stopped when I started crying. I told my daddy the next day. Told me to stop making up stories. But soon after that, Mr. Beaumont promoted my daddy to vice president. Again a little time later, my daddy had to work late again. And Mr. Beaumont was gonna give me a ride home. And I begged. And I pleaded. And I insisted I'd take the bus. But Daddy warned me how important it was to keep Mr. Beaumont happy. So I got in that car. And I stayed real quiet. And I stayed awake. And I made sure not to do anything that would give him the wrong idea. Didn't matter. And shortly after that, Mr. Beaumont took my virginity in the back of his SUV. God, it took so long to get the scent of his cheap cologne off my skin. I can sometimes still smell it. But Daddy was so happy. Oh, he was so happy. So as long as I kept Mr. Beaumont happy. Everything was good. But then Mr. Beaumont, he got me pregnant. And he was so scared that he was gonna get put in jail. That his wife would find out. He paid for the abortion. Gave me 2000 dollars in cash to keep quiet. And he avoided me like the plague. And pretty soon, things went back to the way they used to be. And Daddy became miserable again. I loved my dad. And I knew what I did was wrong. But I did it to make him happy. Pretty soon he couldn't stand the sight of me. (sniffs) That is why my daddy died. Why didn't you tell me this before? I ain't never told anybody. It was easier to pretend it never happened. We rotten. All of us. Baby, God's just punishing us. I know you don't give two shits about what I think, but I reckon your wife could use a hug right about now. You hug her. (metronome ticking) I'm so broken, Sammy. Fix me. Well... (sniffs) It's clearly obvious. We all fucked up. Broken folk. Can't fix broken folk. (metal jingling) It's time for my good Lord to decide our fate. It's time for me to go, Sam. All right, Punchy. What makes you think you're God? In this house, I am God. Sammy. (revolver cocking) Sammy. You did this to yourself, Punchy. (metronome ticking) (revolver firing) Lola: Sam? Sammy! Damien: You did this to yourself, Punchy. Ash? Ash! (gunshots) (footsteps) They give you one of them nicknames? Damien: Flash Jackson. People just call me Flash. Sam: Shit, you fly for Southern? At Southern Airlines we always wear a smile. What's your wife's name? Jasmine. Ashley: Mr. Beaumont took my virginity, in the back of his SUV. (screaming) (guns clattering) (gasps)
