But I can never see who he is. I only feel the arm and its power. Somehow it feels close to my heart. I need to know who he is. In the 100 years of the 20th Century, about 3-5 hundred million people have died of smallpox. Now with the discovery of the cowpox vaccine, people have finally found a way to resist the harm smallpox has caused humankind. On May 8, 1980, the International Health Organization has said "Humans are now immune from smallpox". This is not true. The smallpox virus has not been eradicated. There are two places on earth that still hold samples of the virus. One of the virus specialists has stolen one of the virus samples. then spent 9 years to mutate the genes in an attempt to create a lethal biological weapon. His name is Kenner Osama Muhammad. That is the one we will be escorting. This is our mission... the target of this operation. They have 5 cars, book-ended by military vehicles. This is our first point of attack. There are other ambush points. This car will be blown up here. We will then immediately transfer. Leave nothing behind. Understand? The American Army caught him a week ago, claiming that he destroyed all the mutated samples. But when Kenner came back to give his statement, he said he did not destroy all of them, but had kept only one. That one is the new genre of smallpox... that cannot be prevented by the cowpox vaccine. He is holding it hostage, demanding that we escort and protect him and his family safely back to Norway before he will hand it over. I want you guys to be sharp, know what you're doing and be safe. Ice, look after them. Yes, sir. Base, confidential documents have been found here. Agent Sean Wong from the IDC? This is Transport Team One. Agent Sean Wong from the IDC? We are the Jordanian Police. Your caravan may be attacked... Ice... Ice... This is Agent Sean Wong of the IDC. We are under attack. Do you read? Over, I need backup now! Do you copy? Over? I need backup now! Ram through it! Ram through it! Go back! Go back! Car 3, Car 4, anyone copy? Get out the car! Go! Go... Go! Out the car! Out the car! - Ross, protect Kenner. - Come here. Watch for snipers! Car 3 report casualties. Car 3 do you copy? Ross, go check. Jon, cover! Jon! Ice? Are you okay? I'm fine. Are you okay? Ice, nine o'clock! Paka, cover me! Go! Go! Go! Are you okay? Yes Ice, move! RPG! We're done here. Retreat... Cover me. Go. Go. Exit door! Exit door! Go! Go! Go! Take the girl! That's it. Come here. Clear. Move! Protect her! Get down! Cover your ears. Cover your ears. Ice, move! Covering. Move! This behind me is the freighter... suspected of being attacked by an unknown virus. It had a shuttle route, ferrying goods between Thailand and Malaysia. There were 14 crew members on board. We can confirm all of them have died from the illness. The ACDC has yet... to comment on this matter. Boss, It's Sean. Hey Tyler, did you see the news about the Malaysian freighter? I saw it. 3 months ago, you didn't believe I had Kenner's mutated smallpox sample. I told you I was going to get it. Shall we continue with our business? You remember Carnot? I remember. Carnot is extremely deadly but we can't rely on body fluids alone as a means of contraction. Smallpox can be transmitted by air. I combined the two together to create a new virus that can be transmitted by air without any other restrictions. All vaccines from before will be useless. It will cause more fear than AIDS. That's impressive. We already have the formula for the vaccine and the medicine. Our plan is to slowly spread the virus across the 5 major continents. The number of infections will only take up a fraction of the population and that will be enough to have the world in a state of panic. The market for the vaccine will be much greater than the medicine. We release the medicine and then the vaccine and that's where the money comes in. This will put you in the top ten wealthiest men on earth. No matter how successful your arms trade business is, it's nothing in comparison with this bad boy. If you didn't become a wanted criminal, the new addition to the top ten wealthiest men should be you. I'd rather be the rich guy that nobody knows about. We'll be in touch. Kenner, stop running! Stop! I said stop running! Kenner! Son, what do you want to eat? Mom will cook it for you. No way. What is this? What is this? He escaped from the lab. We went after him but... well this happened. Please tell me the stuff is still there. It's all here. Yeah it's me. When will the specialist arrive? One week from now. Not only will she have to find the Carnot sample, she'll have to finish Kenner's work. Find someone to handle it, we can't be showing our faces around here. The bullet shot into your skull is lodged into the precentral gyrus of the brain and is sitting on the corpus callosum. Your team of doctors have been through your case many times these weeks. There's simply no safer way to remove this bullet. Will he live? Pressure is being exerted on the corpus callosum of his brain. This will cause major problems to your entire nervous system. Your body will gradually lose the natural sensations it should have, and as your case gets worse, you will completely be paralysed. How much longer do I have? Well, at this stage you have about two weeks. But we know you're not supposed to leave the hospital because without the immediate medical attention a hospital can give you, you will be at a greater risk. Ice's ashes... have been sent back. What happened between her and I... Sorry. I don't want to waste my time here. I want to go home. Mrs. Wan has been so worried about you these months that her sciatica has worsened. Nurse Wang In two weeks, I will be leaving on a long trip. But you've just come home. Yes. I'll keep more money with you. Please continue to take care of my mother. Don't worry. I'll stay and take care of her. I didn't cook well today. Mom's cooking always tastes so good. What are you worried about? I've recovered. I'm on leave, so I can be with you every day. Eat the food you cook. To miss someone... is a very painful thing. Those months while you were in the hospital, I had the same dream almost every night. Our whole family was at sea... One by one you'd disappear until only I was left. Jon, I have to tell you this. I've always told you your father abandoned us but the one who gave up on this family... was me. You're not my only son. You have an elder brother. I married your father when I was 20. We enjoyed life. I never thought about the future until I gave birth to you two boys. but your father didn't. He only cared about gambling. He lost his job because of it but he just gambled more. When you were 2 I thought I'd bring you both with me then make other plans, but I didn't count on your brother grasping my hand, crying and refusing to let us go. I was desperate; afraid your father would come home. In the end, I carried you and left and locked him in at home. When I was downstairs I heard him crying and screaming "Mom! Don't go!" Mom... Don't be sad. It's in the past. I've carried this guilt for over twenty years. Jon I finally got news of them. I was thinking of how to get in touch with them. But with your injury, I was so afraid to lose... I'll bring them back. Okay? The numerous crimes the Defendant has committed over the years indicates that... he is a danger to society and its people. Defendant Man Yeung, On the charge of armed robbery of the Black Pearl Jewelry Shop on February 5th, 2008, I find you guilty and sentence you to ten years' imprisonment. In addition, for resisting arrest and attacking a police officer on November 1st, 2010, three years' imprisonment; both sentences to be served concurrently. Give me the keys! Man Yeung, a 33 year old felon charged with armed robbery and attacking a police officer, escaped from the court house after his trial this afternoon by jumping off the fourth floor. I found the guy who betrayed you. You'll never guess who it is. See? Yeung You know how I am... I did it only because I had no choice. Yeung, I know I'm not loyal... I'll change, please give me a chance. Just once... Yeung, please, just one chance. Spare me, please... Yeung! The disloyal can't stick around. Where are you hiding now? You still don't trust me after so long? I'm a cop. You don't trust a cop? The pay is $200,000. After the job, you better disappear. If you don't... It's not that you don't trust me, it's me that can't trust you. Sir, I'm a doctor How is he? He's having a very severe headache. I've already given him a shot of painkillers. May I see your medication? Have you just had surgery? Yes. Doctor, what is his condition? I think it's the air pressure that caused his headaches. In any case, please lower the altitude of the aircraft or he may fall into a coma, which will be very dangerous. I'll try to contact the control tower. Julian, please inform Lumpur. Feeling better? Yes, thanks. You shouldn't fly right after such a major surgery. May I know what surgery you had? I was shot in the head. They couldn't remove the bullet. Don't worry, I'm a cop. I know a very reputable neurosurgeon. I can refer you. Sure. I'll meet you tomorrow. Okay. Bye-bye. Can you attend an appointment tomorrow? Yes, thank you. You're welcome. I have a ride, may I give you a lift? That's all right. I'll take a taxi. Dr. Kan. Hi. - Stay in touch. - See you tomorrow. The guy at the airport looked at me just now. Follow the white car ahead. Pull over. What happened? Find a quiet place and finish him off. Rachel... So the guy who messed up our gig is your former teammate Jon Man. You almost killed him... and now running into him like this... What a coincidence. Did you find out what he's here for? Visiting family. When will your people make a move again? Tonight. Stop, Man Tin! Stand still! You run fast for a limp. Damn gimp, you're quite a handful. My son always repaid my debts. Your son is in trouble himself. How can he help you? Hey! None of your business. I'll be after you. Let's go. Thank you. I'm Jon Man. Chef Man, my buddy! Tin! Lend me your wok. My son is back. Yeung is here? God dammit! My younger son, Jon. You have a younger son? Help yourself. Don't be shy. You're cooking, Grandpa? Champ Bring the dish to your uncle. I have an uncle? Just bring it over. He's at the last table. Okay. Hello, Uncle. Can you understand Mandarin? What's your name? Champ. It sounds like a boy's name. Grandpa named me. He said it's suitable for a boy or girl. In gambling as in life, one must always win. Champ! Come back to eat! Coming! Damn! That was like a dream. It's been 29 years. I didn't think I'd see you again. I'm sure your mother doesn't feed you well. She didn't even know how much water to use to cook rice. She cooks... well now. Poor thing, she has to cook for herself. So, how is she doing? She has sciatica. She can't walk well, needs a wheelchair. That's fate. I'm lame, she's in a wheelchair. God damn, even as a lame she's better off than me. She wants to see you and brother. So we must go? Is she the queen? Don't talk about her, it makes me angry. Come... Have a drink with your old man. Thanks. That's a lot of money. Grandpa put me in charge of money. He said we'd starve if he held the cash. Uncle, there's Grandpa's bed. Champ What are you doing? They're all perfect scores. Why are you burning them? They're useless. What do you mean? Three years ago, dad promised me if I got a 100 100%. he'd give up being a bad guy and come back to live with us. I want him to come back so I worked really hard. I did everything he asked. I just asked him to do one thing, but he didn't. Champ, your dad is a bad guy? Read this, Uncle. "Head Culprit of Armed Robbery Escapes" What is your name? Where do you live? Only you live in Kowloon City? Why didn't you bring your I.D. card? You know what to do. Grandpa is always like that. Dr. Kan, Are you all right? I'm fine, it's just a scratch. The research report for the mutated smallpox came out today. It's confidential, so I must give it to you in person. This mutated strain is many times more viral so we tried to adapt a new vaccine from the old formula. Progress is optimistic. And this virus... is definitely related to Kenner, but I don't understand. What? If Kenner wanted to make a bio-weapon, why would he make this simple virus? I'm worried that he's making something much more than a mutated smallpox. LBK is a first-class pharmaceutical plant. I negotiated a million-dollar contract for you but you just turned Mr. Levinson down flat. I'm so embarrassed. I love my current job. You can help people in a pharmaceutical plant. Everyone in the world will benefit. I don't understand how you think. Mom, you told me all their tricks. Not every pharmaceutical company is bad. How much conscience can a multi-billion dollar business have? Forget it. You're full of excuses. Stop already, Mom. What is this? Rachel! Run! This is what I want. Carnot sample? Go to ACDC tomorrow and get it for me from the virus sample storage. I cannot remove any virus samples from the lab. Mom... Get it, and nothing happens to your mother. This is Rachel Kan. Please leave a message. I will get back to you as soon as possible. Dr. Kan, these are... Reporters, here to interview me. Hand over your guns, on the floor! All set here. Good. Get out. Sir, you cannot park here. I'm waiting for someone. I'll be leaving soon. Go as soon as you can. Dr. Kan, I need to examine what's in your hands... Stop! Calling control room, calling control room... Freeze! If they get caught, we're in trouble. Get rid of them. Police! Get out! Get out! Hello? Dad, bring Champ to the train station now. What's going on, Yeung? Don't ask, just go now! Turn around. Go to the train station! Miss, can you hear me? Are you okay? There are two injured civilians outside the ACDC... Don't kill a cop! I'm your younger brother! Those cops are in on it! Jon! Get in! Sit tight! Police! Move! Move! Move! Yeung, we're at the train station. Wait at the ticket office. Move! Police! Find a vantage point. Speak. Man Tin is at the station and made a phone call. Keep your eye on him. Anything happens, take the girl. Don't come over. Police are tailing you. What's going on? The police want to kill me. I can't come out. I'll leave you tickets. Wait for my call. You see the electronic appliances booth? Yes. Walk over there. Stop. Do you see his father? Do you see his father? Near the convenience store! Dad, board the train; I'll come for you. Hurry! Hurry! Grandpa! Champ, go! Go! Hurry Catch the train! The train to Gemas is about to depart. All passengers please abroad now. Go on! Call HQ, contact the Railway Department! How's Yeung? He couldn't get on? Look Champ. it's Dad. Dad... Champ - Yeung. - Dad. Sit. Yeung, he's your younger brother. Turn yourself in. Those cops are in on this. Turning himself in would be suicide. You were once a cop too. Have you thought about Champ? She can't lose you. Do you want her to spend her life in hiding with you? Turn yourself in with me. Stop it! Get out! Get out! We're not going to see your mother! You're so selfish. Had you thought about your family, you wouldn't be here now. And you call yourself a father. That's not up to you to say! Yeung! Yeung, stop it! Yeung! Stop! Quit it, you two... Stop, Yeung! Stop it... Stop it! It's my fault. I was never good enough. That's why your mom left Yeung and l. Did she ever consider... A broken mirror can never be whole again? Your brother and I chose the same path. He is a thief but he's a righteous thief who takes good care of Champ and me. I'm the one responsible for this. I took away decades of love between you brothers. Jon... You must forgive him. I can't. I'm a cop. Jon... What's wrong, Jon? Evacuate the workers in the depot now. We'll arrest them when the train stops. Delay those cops! Dad, something's wrong. We need to go. Take care. Police. Don't move! Take Champ and hide. Outlaws on the train... You are surrounded by police. Turn in your weapons and surrender now. Stop! Don't hurt my family! Yeung! Take Champ and run! Leave me behind. I can't get away. Hurry! Come out, Champ. Go! Cover your ears. Move! Move! Go! Champ, come down. Champ! Help... Champ! Hands up! Man Yeung has many hideouts. I'll go look for him. Hide the girl. Yes, sir. Get in. In any case, you shouldn't have run away with your brother. You are now a suspect in the ACDC case. I believe you'd never do this, but only I believe you. As long as your brother is at large, you're implicated. Just don't let anything happen to my brother. But he is a repeat felon. How can I help him? Damn, he's Yeung's brother. His oral statement indicates our involvement. Don't worry, we're halfway through this. When the hospital quiets down, kill him. Sean, I want to talk to you about your former partner Jon Man. Doctor, why so late? You want to kill me? Give me my daughter back. I'll give you your stuff. Quick. Where are you keeping her? Speak! She's in the old building on Pudu Street. Where is my daughter? Where is my daughter? I'll kill your daughter... Where is my daughter? I'll take you there... Hey! Help! Help... Where is my daughter? Last night, someone tried to kill me at the hospital. They were Russell's men. There is no use telling me this now. You're on the most wanted list, with orders to shoot to kill. Do me a favour Jon, turn yourself in. Surrender. Not yet. I know where Champ is. Don't act rash. Jon? Walter, Ross. Go secure the entrance. You know, I never told Russell to harm you, he's the one that sold you out. Go get the money. That's 600,000 dollars. Let's make this simple, you give me what I want, you can have your daughter back. You have my word. Go tell Keith to bring his daughter up. Bring Dr. Kan and her mom over. Where's my stuff? Dr. Kan, there's a USB drive on the desk, with the formula in it. You need to extract the smallpox DNA and Carnot RNA specified in the formula, do you understand? Combine them together to create the mutated virus. Now, I know what the formation should look like, so please do not be sneaky. If it doesn't match, you'll watch your mom die. Let us go now. You're an expert on viruses, you should know that the human body is the most ideal incubator. What do you want? Please don't hurt my mother... I've given you everything you want... Freeze! Hand over your guns! Sean, only two fingers. You know I'm faster than you right? Take your jacket off. Hey! You and me... we're the same. All we want is the money. But if you let him ruin everything, not only will you lose the money, you'll never see your daughter again, ever. We will rescue Champ. Don't let him go. Get down! Man Yeung, stop! Sean, you go first! Why did you do that? Ice was collateral damage. It's over. Only I have the antidote in the whole world. Let me go or she will be the next collateral damage. Bring Dr. Kan for the girl. I'll call you. Man Yeung! Stop running! Get in. Do they still have Champ? You'll die if you don't go to the hospital. I won't go! Brother... Help me... Just this once. I wouldn't have guessed you'd see me like this. When we were kids... What were we like? You were two; you were like a lump of tofu. Your nickname was Tofu. Mom told me. I've always loved eating her tofu soup. Brother, forgive mom. She feels so much guilt. We've been apart for so long. I have no feelings for her. She's a stranger. I felt nothing for dad... when I first came. I'd been fatherless for over 20 years... But when he fell in front of me, I felt him return. What dad and I have is different from you. Dad brought me here when I was 12. He still loved to gamble. I hated him. I was determined to make something of myself so no one would despise me. I chose this path when I was 16. A few years later, I stole my boss' stock... No! $200,000... Thank you! Thank you Boss, for sparing his life! You're lucky you got the money, you degenerate gambler. He would have died here tonight. I guarantee my son will never touch your stuff. Thank you. Not that way... this way. Gui said you would take it easy on us. He's right. Why else would I have taken your money? I have a reputation to uphold. This is only the 6th floor. If you both jump off, I'll leave this all behind. Son, be brave. We're both tough. Let's go! Don't die... Yeung, don't die. What I share with dad, you'll never have. Dispatch, there is a suspected fugitive vehicle. Requesting confirmation. I know dad was a bad cop. I became a cop so mom would forget him. But I never imagined... Mom would miss you guys so much. Please go see her. How can l, with the way I am now? This is from mom. Don't make it worse for yourself. Freeze! Freeze! Don't move! You took my daughter; what do you want? Take care of something for me first. At 10:00, Dr. Kan will be escorted by the IDC to the Police Air Base. Take her out and meet me at Golden Triangle at 10:30. Yeung, I know you won't forgive me. Sean wants me in exchange for your niece? They can cultivate the virus using her body. But they need you; there must be unfinished business. I'm worried about Champ, too. The virus has been inside her for 24 hours. If she's not injected with the antidote in 10 hours, she will die. IDC is taking me to the... Singapore Medical Authority so I can research and manufacture an antidote, but we cannot finish the job in 10 hours. Then, I become an accomplice in her murder. Dr. Kan, we have to go. Come on. Ross. Ross. Sean still needs Rachel; I can lure him out. Let me out first. Jon, even though Dr. Kan's statement favours you, they're not going to release you. It's not our turf. They're going to transfer you to a maximum security prison. I'm trying every single way possible to locate Sean and your brother. I need to get them before I can get you out of here. Wait for me. I'm out of time. You know I don't have time! Ross! Ross! Chopper 4, 3 minutes to tower. That's a very serious crime. I don't have a choice. You must help me. Only you can help me find Sean. Please. Get off! Man Yeung! Put the gun down! Jon escaped. He's coming here. What you just did, there's no turning back... Chopper 1, Chopper 2, ready for take off. Chopper 4 has been taken hostage. Get ready to chase Chopper 4. Control, please locate Chopper 4 now. Land at Golden Triangle. Sean wants me to hand over the hostage there. Chopper 4 is over Bukit Bintang... heading towards Puchong. Tactical Low! This is Chopper 1, Chopper 4 has changed direction. All ground units head towards Golden Triangle. Dive down. Faster. Attention all ground units. The helicopter kidnapped by the suspect has already changed direction heading towards Golden Triangle. Please respond to location immediately. Bank left! Attention all ground units. Immediately go to Tun Razak car park area. Suspect helicopter will be landing shortly. Zero in on the prohibited area. All officers from zone A and B please rush to the area. Put it on. I can track you if anything happens. Sean, we're at Golden Triangle. There are two cars parked on the shoulder across the street. Go there and wait. Lucky you made it in time. Don't worry... There's still time to see where you rank in the top ten wealthiest. You should know how much time the girl has left. There's eleven of Kenner's formulas inside that PDA. You created the virus, no one is more clear on its variables than you. Analyze each formula to get the right combination to create the medicine and the vaccine. It's all up to you, doctor. Tell the captain to start the engine. All right. Mark, the vaccine is being made. The girl is useless. Get rid of her. Champ, Champ... Champ... Champ... Yeung! Sean, Sean... Don't open it. Sean has injected the virus into Champ. I heard them say Dr. Kan is making the antidote. Hide Champ, I'll go find Rachel. Go to the engine room and keep them from starting the ship. Be careful. Stay in touch. Mike, why haven't we started moving yet? Well go and find out what's going on. Grenade! Rachel. The antidote formulas are all in here. Don't lose it. Go, quickly. Go! Are you okay? Shoot if anything happens. Catch it. Go. Yeung, Rachel fell under the deck. I'm going down now. I'll come over. It's alright... PDA... I dropped the PDA... I dropped the PDA... Don't worry, it's here. Hang in there. Sean! He's here! Jon! Get ready to do your bitch! Come out! Hang in there, brother. We still have a chance. Yeung, Sean shoots too fast. The only way is, we both go out together. When he shoots one of us, the other will have a chance to shoot him. Remember, I told you, we're very tough. I've had the same dream almost every night. Our whole family was at sea... One by one you'd disappear. In the end, only I was left. Brother That feeling is back... I finally know who reached out and saved me in my dream. We've been apart for over two decades... But he never left me. Yeung I know you will not forgive me. I cannot forgive myself. I called your father selfish but in the end, so was l. If I had the chance to choose again, I would never leave you. It is right that you don't forgive me but I beg you to accept your younger brother. Do you remember? When you were kids... You loved him very much. I didn't have the courage to tell him that it was me who separated the two of you. I caused your father to lose a son. It's all my fault. I'm sorry. I am old. I may never have the chance to see you again. I just want you to know... Since you are now a father, I hope you will make plans for your child. You must take the path you were meant to take. Don't be like me... Or you will regret it all your life. Take care of yourself. Mom... Champ, come. Dad has made mistakes which I've never faced. I'm going to own up to them. I'll be back soon. Stay with grandma from now on, understand? Meet your grandma. Grandma. Good girl. Where's Jon? When you leave this world, the people in your heart will continue the journey with you. You will always have them, even though they may not be with you. If I can only choose one kind of 'forever', And, they are my 'forever'. check and edit by necroboi
