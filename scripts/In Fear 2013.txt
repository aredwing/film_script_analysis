Pick up. - Hey, it's Lucy. - Ah, hello, Lucy. - (RECORDING BEEPS) - Er, hello, answering machine. It's me, Tom. Remember? We met a couple of weeks ago. Think you were chatting me up at the bar. Yeah, so I was thinking there was this festival this weekend in Ireland that I'm going to, and I thought maybe... okay, I'll call later, actually. - (PHONE TONE RINGS) - (RECORDING BEEPS) Hey, it's Lucy. TOM: Listen, I didn't... about this weekend, I didn't mean just you and I. It's not like a date or anything. It's... there's going to be, like, a whole bunch of us camping. So, yeah, bring some friends, if you have any, just in case we don't get along, which we would, if you came. (WATER TRICKLING) (OBJECTS CLATTER) (DOOR CREAKING) Hello? Quick. Quick. Let's get out of here. Here, close the door. That was a nice pub. I think I counted 12 men, seven dogs, no women, and me. I thought since the festival doesn't start tonight, there's no bands playing, for a special treat... I've booked a hotel. - Ah. - Mm-hmm. - You cheeky fuck. - Ow. Fore... okay, we've started already foreplay. You said we were going up to the festival tonight. - That was the plan. - Yes... Now I have friends up there camping, thinking we're on our way. It's our two-week anniversary. Remember? Oh, you can't have a two-week anniversary. It's a nice hotel. Look in the glove box. I printed out some stuff from the website. Go on, look at it. "Your slice of paradise in the Emerald Isle." Mm-hmm. That's why I booked it. Forgot to say you look really nice today. (CHUCKLES) Okay. Let's go. You mean it? - Yeah. - Okay. We have to wait here until 7:00, and then someone's gonna come and show us the way. That's what I arranged. What if I said no? I thought I was being vaguely romantic. (HORN HONKS) Ah. That's him? I guess so. All right, wait. Whew. LUCY: You know, I was chatted up on the way to the toilet. Oh, yeah? Barman thought that I was a "strong, fine-looking young thing." That's a good line. What? You want me to go back? (CHUCKLES) You want me to go back and have words? I'll have a stern word in that man's ear. I'll take him outside, and I'll hit him right in the middle of the forehead. (LAUGHS) Well, whilst you were on the toilet, some guy bumped into me and spilt my drink all over me, on my new jumper. And then I ended up buying him and all his friends a drink. The whole pub? Why? Well, he bumped into me, spilt my drink on me, so I was like, "Excuse me," and he said it wasn't his fault, and I said, "Well, it wasn't my fault." And then it got a bit weird, and then he did offer to buy me a drink, but by that point, I was like, "Well, look, I'll buy you and your friends a drink," just to keep things calm. 'Cause I'm a lover. I'm not a fighter. What? (HORN HONKS) Oh, okay. LUCY: Yeah, nice to meet you. (SILENT) Tom, no! He could have seen you. - Oh. - Don't be rude like that. TOM: That's really weird. Do you want some help? Fine! (CHAINS CLINK) (WIND WHISTLING) Whoo! Yeah, yeah. Very funny, Lucy. Ugh. - Got dirty hands now. - Ugh. - Stay away. Ugh. - Huh? - Huh? Huh? - No. Ugh. Huh? Huh? (DISTANT HORN HONKING) TOM: Idiots. They're the guys from the pub? Think so. (HONKING CONTINUES) - LUCY: I need to make a phone call. - Fine. I don't know where I am, actually. Tom booked a hotel, so I'm not going to be there tonight. (CHUCKLES) I've talked with him. It's a sad field. How can a field be sad? I don't know. Just is. Oh, look. There's an angry tree. There's some worried mud. - (MUFFLED THUMP) - (LUCY LAUGHS) - What? - I just went over a grumpy stone. LUCY: Whoa, whoa. Stop. Map says to go that way. - The sign says that way. - Yeah, but if... you know, if they're different, we should check. Or we just follow the signs. TOM: We could just throw the map away. Look, it says Kilairney House Hotel on the left. All right, I'm going. Thought I saw someone. Oh, yeah? Was that the end of the story? You don't have your map out. Just following the signs now? - I'm giving you a little bit of time. - I win. - LUCY: Can't see what it says. - TOM: It says "Kilairney House." LUCY: They're hidden a little bit. - This way. - Yeah. LUCY: Oh. That's... LUCY: Um... that's wrong. What does the map say? I don't know. Can't see with this fucking orange blob. - Well, we followed the signs. - I'm going to call the hotel. (BEEPS) He's going to say follow the signs. We may as well just turn round and phone back when we come back. - Hey... - (POPS) - ow... fuck. - Sorry. - I have... sorry. - (LAUGHS) We've got a reservation for tonight, but we've been following the signs... We've been following the signs but we've got lost. LUCY: Shh! And we don't know where to go. We've been trying to find the way for a little bit. - Um... well, there's... - (BIRD SQUAWKS) they've got two signs, and... Yeah, no, that's what we've been doing, but now it's telling us to go back. Yeah, and I was trying to map read, but it was saying different to what the signs were saying. Hello? They just hung up. (BEEPS) - Hey, I'm going to go... - It's not ringing back. - I'm going back, okay? - Well, no... he was in mid-conversation. It hung up. I'm just going to try to call back. - Um... - I'm going to go. - I'm going. - Come on. - No, wait. I have to... - I'm going. (SIGHS) Shit. (BEEPS) It's not answering. I don't have any signal. LUCY: The Land Rover. Wait, wait, wait. Stop him. Stop him. (HONKS HORN) - Hey! Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Well, it must be that way. - What do you mean? Why? - That's the way he came from. - So what? - So it's that way, 'cause he must have come from the hotel. Yeah, but no. He left us before we went into the... through the gate. Yeah, well, he's obviously gone and got someone, and then he's going back... he's gone back, and he's going back to get someone else. Ah. "Kilairney House Hotel" left. Well, it says the hotel's meant to be secluded, so... must be... How can we be back at this bit again? You must have done something wrong. We haven't done anything wrong. Followed the signs. Well, let's just go back to the pub, and they can send someone to meet us there. Okay. Let's do that. LUCY: This isn't the way we came. We're going back. We can't be. We just can't see it yet 'cause of all the trees. Tom, we're going in circles. We can't, Lucy. We're nearly there. - How are we nearly there? - We are. We don't know where we're going. LUCY: What are you doing? I'll go ahead and check, see if I can see it from outside. (LEAVES RUSTLING) (RUSTLING CONTINUES) (RUSTLING STOPS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (GATE CREAKS) Tom? Tom? (SIGHS) Tom? (SCREAMS) Whoa! It's me. It's me. (TOM LAUGHS) What? - Come on. - Did you pull my hair? No. Hurry up. Scared? TOM: Aw. - We're not lost, by the way. - Oh, really? But if we were... it's not either of our faults. - (CAR HORN BLARING) - (WINGS FLUTTER) Tom...? (HORN BLARING) (HORN BLARING) Tom? (BLARING STOPS) (TOM WHISPERS) Come on, get in. Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on, come on. Get in. - (BLARING RESUMES) - Fucking hell. - Keys aren't in the car. - What do you mean? They're not in the car. - They're not in your pocket? - No, they're not in my pocket. They have to be around here, then. - (BLARING STOPS) - They have to be here. If you say you left them in the car, then they have to be here. (BLARING RESUMES) - Fucking hell. - Tom! God. - Fuck, there they are. - Were they there all the time? No. I don't know. TOM: Ahem. I don't know why I was so scared there. You were scared there as well. (CHUCKLES) I see you were. Huh? You were quite... At the time, I thought someone like, was gonna to be sitting at the bush, waiting for me or something, jumping out. I must have taken the keys out of the car when I jumped out or something, or how could they have got there? I swear they weren't in my pocket. We're not lost. We're in a fucking maze. Was that there before? - What? - The sign on the door. Who cares? (BUCKLE CLICKS) No. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. - What is that? - It's a map. Of what? What does it say? It's in case of a fire. There's a track through the forest back to the main road. Right. Let's go. Lucy. Lucy? TOM: Come on. It's nothing. - Lucy? - I'm coming. Wait. I'm coming. Which way, left? Lucy, left? Yes, it'll be on the left. Just give me the map for two seconds. Um... Yeah. Good. So if we get reception on the main road, we should just phone them and just say... just say send someone down to show us the way. What are you talking about? Well, if we can phone them, at least maybe they can come pick us up. Huh? What? What's wrong? Tom, I do not want to have to go past that cabin again. LUCY: This is it. - (CAR THUMPS) - (TOM SIGHS) TOM: Shit. - LUCY: Oh, fuck. - (TOM SIGHS) (RAIN PATTERING) TOM: We can't go this way. (TOM SIGHS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (FAINT CRACK) (CRACKLING) LUCY: Something's wrong! Tom, slow down. Tom, stop. Stop. Tom! Give me the map. LUCY: Just don't know what the fuck is going on. I mean, a 50-foot fucking tree falling? TOM: We're just getting ourselves in a panic, and it's stupid. LUCY: Just don't know what the fuck's going on. - LUCY: My God, we... - What? It's just branches. Well, have I got loads of... have I got room on that side? I don't know. - Huh? - No. - What? - Kind of. Well, do I have room or not? What? Lucy, look out that side. - I'm... fuck! - I'm just asking. No, it's okay. I don't know. It's fucking tiny, okay? Well, all you've got to do is look out the window. I'm just asking you to help. (TOM GROANS) There's another sign. "Kilairney House Hotel." - (LUCY SCREAMS) - What? - Tom! - What are you doing? Tom, there's someone standing there. - Where? What? - Back there. - There is someone there. - All right. - What are you doing? - Well, if there's someone standing... - No! No, Tom! - No, I'll go back. - Tom, fucking stop! - Look, if there's a guy there, I'll ask him if we're going the right way. If there's not someone there, you'll be happy. Where? Where is he? (RUSTLING) It's a scarecrow. It's just your imagination playing tricks. - I really need to go for a piss. - Now? I'll be quick. I'm the fastest pee-er in the world. You're trying to prove a point. I'm going to wet myself. Be two shakes. (WIND WHISTLING) (WIND GUSTING) (THUMPS) (PANTING) - What? - Tom! Turn the lights off! Tom, there's someone behind you! What? (FAINTLY) There's someone behind you! Turn the lights off! (FAINT SCREAMING) Tom! Turn the fucking lights off! Tom! Tom! - What is wrong with you? - Tom, there was someone there. Can't I just take a quick piss? What you doing? - You didn't see them. - What? There's no one there! Lucy, we've just had that moment with the scarecrow. My door slammed, and then there was someone there when I turned the lights on again. Your door slammed? What, so your door opened up? No, your door slammed. My door was closed. Your door slammed. Well, I didn't hear anything. You're scaring me, honestly. Tom, I'm scared. He was wearing a white mask. There was no face. I couldn't see his face. Or he had his face painted or something. I don't know. LUCY: Could it have been one of those men we saw? Why would you say that? What happened in the pub? I've told you. TOM: What the...? Ah, that's really weird. They're mine. - No, they're not. - Yes, they are. - It can't be your clothes. - No, they're my clothes. - (CAR DOOR OPENS) - LUCY: Wait, no. Tom, leave it. Be two shakes. - That's yours? - Yes! It's all mine! This doesn't make sense. I mean, we've been with the car the whole time. - Why is this happening? - I don't know, Lucy. What do you mean? Why are they doing this to us? TOM: Why would I know?! (TOM SNORTS) (LUCY SIGHS) Whew. (SIGHS) Are you fucking with me? (TOM CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Why would you say that? (TOM SIGHS) (SIGHS) (TIRES SCRAPE) - What are you doing? - I'm stopping. No point in going on. I don't know where we're going. There's no signs... and the petrol's low. May as well just sit here until we can see something. (SIGHS) Ahem. (CAP RATTLES) Right. Let's play a game. You ready? - What? - Let's play a game, okay? You have to answer straightaway. Whatever I say, you have to answer straightaway or else it doesn't count, okay? Okay. Pink or blue? Blue. A sofa or a... or a seat? - Sofa. - Running or walking? Walking. - Bare feet, shoes? - Bare feet. Naked or clothed? Naked. Clothed. Ah, eh... you said, "naked" first. I changed my mind. A knife or a fork? Come on. You have to answer straightaway. Okay... gun or a knife? I know something happened in the pub. (THUMPS WHEEL) Yep. - Tell me. - No, that's it. Tell me. Tell me about the barman. Maybe you did something to him. Could be what you didn't do to him. Could be what you didn't do to him. - Fuck you. - Where you going? I'm cold. I'm getting a coat. (TAPS TRUNK LID) (LOCK CLICKS) (SOBBING) You okay? No, not really. You okay? Yeah. I just don't know where we're going. You building a nest? Yeah. (LUCY SCREAMING) (TOM SCREAMS) Stop! Hey! - (LUCY SCREAMING) - TOM: Stop! Hey! Hey! Tom! LUCY: Oh, God! - Oh, God! - Stop! TOM: No! - Get in! Go! - (SCREAMING) - (YELLS) - Tom! (LUCY WAILS) What the fuck is going on? LUCY: What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? - (SCREAMING) - (YELLS) (YELLING) - Oh, did I... - Tom, no. TOM: He hit the car. He hit the car. He definitely hit the car. He hit the side of the car. - Hit the side of the car. - Was he wearing a mask? I can't see anything. I can't see anyone. No, I don't think he was wearing a mask. I don't think he was. Lucy, I need to... I need to know what has happened, 'cause I can't... What if it's him? What if it's him? What if we killed... what if we killed someone? What if we killed someone? He wasn't wearing the mask. What if he's running away? What if... (WIPERS SQUEAK) I'll go. If you say it, I'll go. Right now, I'll go. Tell me. Tell me, and I'll drive on if you say it. Tell me. I will drive on. (THUNDER RUMBLING) - (SCREAMING) - What?! Please stop! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey! (LUCY GASPING) - Did you do this to me? - No. Wait, wait, wait. Did you do this to me? - Did you do this to me? - No, it's okay. - What? - Did you do this to me? - He didn't do that to you. - No, we were in the car. Yeah, we were in the car. We stopped. I'm not talking about when you knocked me over. Talking about in that woods. Did you drag me into that clearing, and did you do this to me with a knife? - LUCY: No. We got attacked too. - When? When? Just before. They're still out there, man. They're out there now. - We need to go now. - Fuck. Tom, get in. Hold on. Where... how... where are you from? - I'm from around here. - LUCY: Get in the car. I got attacked. We need to get out of here now. They're going to be looking for us. We need to go now. - We need to get out of here now. - Okay, Tom. Tom. Tom! - Please just get in the car. - Do you want this to happen to you? Do you want it to happen to her? We need to go now. - Tom. Tom, get in. Tom! - I'm serious. MAN: Can we go? I don't care if you take me a mile down the road, even less. Just get me out of here. Drive. We can talk about this later. Please, can we just get out of here now? We need to go now. - Can we go now? - Tom, please. Can we go now, please? Listen... thank you. I know you hit me and everything, but if you guys hadn't come around that corner there... Ah, Jesus. (MAN GROANING) - LUCY: You need a doctor. - Ah, don't worry about me. I'm sure the car took the most of it. (MAN GROANS) Did you see who attacked you? I'm not quite sure. I'll be honest. Could be a group of guys. They drink at the local pub. They're not right in the head. I mean... I don't understand what's going on. I'm Max, by the way. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your names. I'm Lucy. - I'm Tom. - MAX: Tom. (MAX GASPS) So are you... I forgot your name. Linda? Lucy, is it? Lucy. Wanna do me a favor and just tilt the mirror down there just over here? Just want to check something. Just want to check my face. Oh, Jesus. Is it bad? Is it bad? TOM: No, it's not that bad. Oh, that's even worse than I thought it was. That's a lot of blood. We better get going. There's a hotel not far from here. - Yeah, Kilairney House Hotel. - Kilairney House Hotel, yeah. TOM: We just went past the sign. MAX: We'll be able to get a doctor from there or something. Jesus, I... I think I need to lie down. Is that okay? - TOM: What? - Is it okay if I just lie down a bit? TOM: Yeah. Yeah. Do you know where we're going, though, don't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just go straight. If you follow the signs... - TOM: Max. - Yeah? - There's a sign there. - Yeah, just follow it. So are you guys a couple, or...? No. Yeah, we're going to a festival. Just stopping off. - Where's the festival? - Eh, not too far. Why are you staying in the hotel, then? It's none of my business, anyway. I'm sorry. You been drinking, Tom? No. (MAX LAUGHS) No wonder you didn't see me. (LAUGHS) I'm not giving you a hard time, Tom. I'm just... (GROANS) TOM: Uh... hey, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Fucking sitting ducks here. Go, go, go! - Go back? Go back? Go back? - No, go through. - Go back? - Go through it! Tom, go through it! - Go through. Don't stop. - LUCY: No! - Tom! - Don't stop. Go through it. I know who they are. Butchers and hunters, the lot of them. - (GASPS) - (SQUEAKING) MAX: Fuck's sake, Tom. Just going to leave 'em there, Tom? Fucking get rid of 'em. I'll tell you who they are, and I know exactly why they're after me. - LUCY: Why? - Ah, bad blood. Been going on for years. There's this one guy... he'll be out there right now. He's the ringleader. When he was a kid... took a notion to hide in the ditch and wait for a car to come, and just when it was approaching, he stepped out in front of it just to see what would happen. Now, the driver hardly had time to brake. I'm sure they tried. But to avoid hitting the kid, they swerved off the road... crashed the car. Driver was killed instantly. Have we been here? - Huh? - Have we been here? Why'd you bring us back here, Tom? This is the last place in the world I want to be. You've told me you knew these roads. Why are you blaming me? There's no blame here, Tom. I'm just trying to figure out what happened. I've been lying down here in the back, bleeding to death after you hit me with the car. It's not why you're bleeding. I mean, I'm not all there right now. I mean, my head's been fucking cut open. I got... you knocked me down. I mean... look, you don't know the way, but I do. Which way? Go straight ahead, first right. Yeah, right. Right, Tom. Left. Go left. Just keep going straight, Tom. Left. How the fuck did we come...? They'll still be out there. I thought they would have given up by now and gone home. They've changed the signs around. Follow any of the signs, you'll come back to exactly where you started. You brought us here. I followed your directions. You did this. What did you do to piss them off? What? You must have done something. Something's happened. Now, what happened? - We haven't done anything. - What happened? We haven't done anything. - Did you provoke them? - No, we didn't provoke anyone. Nah, something's happened. What's happened? Nothing fucking happened. What about the pub? - What happened in the pub? Did... - Nothing happened in the pub. Did you say something to them? Nothing happened in the pub, all right? Leave it. - Well, clearly something did. - No, nothing happened in the pub. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Lucy, what happened in the pub? - Someone... - Did you say something to them? No, I didn't say anything to them. Nothing happened in the pub. So what? Now, clearly something happened. Tell him, Tom. Why are we having... why are we having this conversation? Huh? - You said something, didn't you? - Tom, please. Lucy, tell me what happened. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. You provoked 'em, Tom. Tom, what happened in the pub? Nothing happened in the pub. Then, why don't you want Lucy to say anything? When it's going to be something that's really stupid - that you're going to be saying! - What? I'm not saying anything... - (YELLS) - MAX: Tom! - Tom! - Tom, where are you going? (SIGHING) Wow. Really exploring his maleness there. Is he always like that? - We only met two weeks ago. - Oh. Well, he did piss off those men in the pub. They took offense, which is why they're doing all this, of course. You were in the pub? I didn't say it earlier, 'cause I didn't want to alarm anybody... but I saw Tom, and Tom spilled this man's pint. No. No, no, no, no. It was the other way around. No. Tom spilled a pint, and he was refusing to buy another one until the man got real nasty with your friend back there. Tom's not like that. He wouldn't... he bought everyone a round. We joked about it. Yeah, I know it's confusing. Christ, this pain is getting worse. You wouldn't have any water on you, would you? Yeah, by your feet. Lucy, could you...? Thanks. It's fine. Couldn't open it for me, could you? MAX: You feel better, Tom? Do you want me to drive? No. I know where we are now. I can get us out. So let's go. My... my head's starting to bleed again. Would you have a handkerchief or something? I don't want to bleed all over your seats. No, I haven't. Oh, you wouldn't check the glove box? It's just that I don't want to ruin all of your upholstery. What's that, Lucy? LUCY: It's a fire hazard warning. Where'd you get that? Tom threw it out the window. Huh. That's strange. LUCY: Did you cut your own face, Max? You took my clothes, pulled my hair. - I did it all. - You dragged me out of the car. I cut the tree. I even wrote on the fucking wall. (CHUCKLES) It was always just me. (SCREAMING) Drive as fast as you fucking can. I've got a knife in the back of her fucking head. Drive as fast as you can, Tom! Where are we going? Where are we going? I'll go straight through the back of her fucking skull. Faster, Tom. - (GROANS) - Faster, Tommy boy. Faster! Lucy, go on, tell him. Can you feel that, Lucy? - I can feel it. - There you go. - Faster, Tom. - I can't go any faster. You can go faster. You're not trying, Tom. I will kill her. I am not joking. - LUCY: Tom! - MAX: Look at the road, Tom. - I can't go any faster. - Yes, you can. You can. I can't go any faster, or else I'll crash the car. You make that choice. Do you want to crash the car, or do you want Lucy to die? You can do it. You can do it. Come on, Tommy. - Come on, Tom. - I can't go any faster. Oh, you can go faster than that, Tom. You can go faster than that, Tom. I can't go any faster! - Faster! - (WAILS) I'll put this knife right through her skull. I'm going to put this knife through her head. - I can't go any faster! - Going to put it through her head, Tom. Faster! Faster! (LUCY SCREAMS) Faster! Faster! - MAX: Whoo! - (LUCY SCREAMS) - Shh, shh, shh, shh. - (SOBBING) You had a choice back there, Tommy boy. I'm not wearing a seat belt. You both are. You probably could have killed me and saved yourselves. Now you've only one more choice to make. I want you to make it, Lucy. I want you to choose which one of you I kill. (SCREAMS) No! Shh, shh, shh, shh. - 10... - Fuck you! It's just a name. Nine... Fuck you! - Do it. - No! - Do it, Lucy. - Eight. - Seven. - No! Six. - Go ahead. - Five. - (SCREAMING) - Four. No. Don't move, Tom. Don't move. (SCREAMS) Three. - How much do you love Tom? - Do it. Do it. - (WAILS) - Two. How much do you love your life? You or Tom? One. Tom! Tom! (TOM SCREAMS) (LUCY SCREAMS) (LAUGHS) Fuck's sake, lads, I don't even have a knife. (LAUGHS) Wow. Thanks. Thank you. What are you doing? Okay, listen, it's been interesting, and thanks for the ride. What are you doing, you fuck? - See you later. - Get out! (LAUGHING) MAX: It's not like I've done anything. Get out of the fucking car! (MAX LAUGHING) Safe home. (TAPS WINDOW) (TOM PANTING) (TOM YELLS) (YELLS) Come on. Come on. Come on. (LAUGHS) - Come on. - You bastard! Come on. Come on! - (LAUGHS) - Get the fuck off me! Come on. Come on. That's it, boy. - Tommy boy. - You're fucked up. That's it. That's it. (MAX LAUGHS) All right, Tom. Come on, Tom. (LAUGHS) (PANTING) (SIGHS) Let's finish this. (PANTING) - (WHIMPERS) - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - Get off. - Shh, shh, shh. Ow, ow, ow. - Shh, shh, shh. - (YELLING) - (BONE CRACKS) - (SCREAMS) (WHIMPERS) (CRYING) Violence is the mother and the daughter. - (SPITS) - (CAR DOOR OPENS) LUCY: Tom? Tom? Tom? (LUCY GROANS) - (WHIMPERING) - Tom. - Tom! - (SOBBING) Tom! (GROANS) Ow, ow. (ENGINE KNOCKING) (TOM WHIMPERS) We're out of petrol. (GRUNTS) I wanted... I wanted to kill him, Lucy. (SIGHS) (PANTING) (RAIN PATTERS) I said your name. I said, "Tom." Tom, get out of the car. Tom! Tom! I can't get... - What are you... - Tom. TOM: Go. Move. Move. Run. (TOM PANTING) Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, wait. (LUCY YELLS) TOM: Okay, turn... turn your light off. Turn your light off. Shh. - Tom. - Do it. Lucy, Lucy... just keep going. Just keep going. Go. Come on. - Stop, Tom. Stop. - (BRANCHES CRACKLING) TOM: What's that? Hey, wait, wait, wait. TOM: Go. Go. (LUCY GASPS) (GASPS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Tom? (LEAVES CRUNCHING) Tom? (BRANCH CRACKS) Tom? Tom? (FAINT RUSTLING) (PANTING) (ENGINE RUMBLES) (WIPERS THUMPING) (CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) MAX: Know what you're thinking! "It looked a lot better on the website!" That took me ages! You know how hard it was to find a place like this? Breakfast is served half-6:00 to 10:00! If you need a hand with your bags, you're going to have to wait! As you can see, I am snowed under! Okay, I'll admit, rooms are a little drafty! (LAUGHS) See you in the morning, Luce. Picture-postcard Ireland. - (BANGS) - (LAUGHS) (FAINTLY) Shit. Shit. Come on, Lucy. Come on. Go faster. What do you want from me?! (HORN HONKS) What do you want?! (TIRES SCREECHING) (HORN HONKS) Come on, Lucy. (LAUGHS) (HORN HONKING) Just finish your fucking game! You fucking got me! (LAUGHS) Whoo-hoo!

(FAINTLY) Don't you fucking move, Max. (SCREAMS) Oh, what is this I cannot see An icy hand Take hold on me? Oh, I am death That none can excel I open the door Of heaven and hell Now death, oh, death How can it be That I must come And go with thee? Oh, death, oh, death How can it be? For I'm prepared For eternity Oh, yes, I've come For to get your soul Leave your body Leave it cold Till drop the flesh From off your frame The earth and worms Both had their claim Too late, too late To holler farewell My doom is fixed I'm summoned to hell As long as God And heaven shall dwell My soul, my soul Shall scream in hell.
