There's nothiung outside these walls for you to believe anymore. Your life, now, is here, with me. But... do not think you won't be safe. I look after everything I own. From now on, when you look at me... you will know who to thank. But... nothing cones for free. You will work for me. You will learn how to be kind to my friends. But don't dare ask them for help. Ever. I wanto to know if I can trust you, just as you can trust me. It's all right. It's all right. Trust. That's all I ask. Out! Out! Come on. What about this one? Leave her with me. Hide. Now. In the wardrobe. Just do what I say. Go away! Help me, please. Please. Help me. No, wait. Wait! That one! Get out! Good. All right. We have guests. Get them ready. Enjoy. What's your name? Can't you hear me? Come on, come on. They are waiting. Goodbye. So... Hear no evil, speak no evil? Do you have a name? You can't speak your name. But you have to have a name. A little angel. I shall call you Angel. Viktor. It's all right. It's all right. Viktor will look after you. And you... will look after me. But... I have something else for you to do. You wil look after the house and prepare the girls. I will show you how. How do you know how to sign. My father was deaf. Where is your father? He's dead. And aabout yours? Wil you came back? I wish mom and dad arguing and fighting stop. I wish dad would go away. Do not worry. You get get out? Escape? It's impossible. Everywhere is locked. Have you always been deaf? Since I was a baby. Where is your family? I don't know. I'm sorry. Your mother? She will find me one day. I like your necklace. As long as you wear this... it will allways protect you. What is the matter? Please. It helps. What's wrong with you? Go! Get out! He likes to be rough with them. He pays extra. I'll call Andre. You have some bruising and a little tear down there. But out from that, you will be ok. Her pelvis was broken, Viktor. You need to take better care of your stock. - And I can't afford to loose more girls. - Your loss. You forget yourself, Andre. And you have a short memory. Just take your payment and leave. But and for her? She is in no fit state. You're an expert in anatomy, Andr. I'm sure she can provide you with options. Just do what you do. The doctor has to finish treating her. Prepare the other girls. Then food. I can hear something. Come to my room. One day... one day things will be different. We can go away from this place. This is why I do all of this. So we can be together. I am going to give you something. This unlocks eveything. The girls rooms, the outer doors. Freedom, if you wanted. You are free to go if you want. I won't follow you. But I know you won't. Because you love me as I love you. You could never leave me, could you? I dreamed about us getting out of this place. I'm never gettin out of here, am I? Promise me you wont let them kill me. Promise me. What is going on? Dope her up! Stay here. Keep a close eye on her. I'll deal with him. Goran! Greetings, Viktor. It's so good to see you again. - I had no idea you were back. - That's good. I'm happy to learn there's still some discretion left in this world. We were passing, so I thought to come and use your "amenities". Whatever you need. You know that. You know my... my beautiful baby brother? Josif! In the militia? Private security consultant. Things are different now. - And hese are your men? - Radovan. And Marko. Marko! And of course Ivan. Ivan. I've seen him before. He's hard to miss. Still with the little mute? You old devil, she must be keeping you more entretained than the others, no? She works hard. Listen. I need to have a private chat, just you and me Of course. And you boys, you have some fun. A drink? - Why are you here, Goran? - Oh, we were in the area. My men, as you know, have been working very hard. It would be cruel to deny them some pleasures, so as we were passing... Passing? To where, exactly? I'm not the best of the liars, am I, Viktor? I could say that I like to keep track of the fortune of my former colleagues. But you wouldtn't believe, would you? You're too clever for that. Then, why are you here? Lists, Viktor. Lists. Lists? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Really? How very curious. It appears that our names are gaining attention. Attention, businessmen as ourselves could do without. About what? About some other more colorful exploits from the last campaign. Apparently we carried our duties with much entusiasm. - How's your relationship with the authorities here? - They are my best customers. The authorities I speak of have a longer reach... than the ones of your mini business here. Have you been talking to anyone? May I remind you, Viktor... that the ink on your hand may grant you some privileges around here... but to people outside, it is not more than a signed confession. I'm just saying, Viktor. To some of our colleagues, denying involvement in events... seem more appealing than taking full responsibility for theyr actions. Our resposability in face of our former friends. Is that why you're here? Worried I betray you? Us, Viktor. Betray us. I'm warning you. Shut the door. Other side. Ivan? Ivan, open the door. Ivan, open the fucking door. What happens there, damn it? Ivan? Viktor. Viktor! - Who did this? - I don't know. Listen. What the hell is that? Who is missing? Where is that little mute of yours? I don't know. Fuck off. Listen to me. I just lost one of my best fucking men. And I'm just not a girl. Two. It's that freak, the mute. Find her. Now. Every window, every door. No one comes in or out. If you see them, you kill them dead. Go! I want to talk to you. You turn up with your militia... I go where and when I pease. Do you understand me, Viktor? Now you have a dead man, and I have two dead girls... - Your house, your responsibility. - Your man killed my girl. She dies. Let that get in your blunt head. On principle she dies. She's gone. Come here. Goran, there. Gotcha! The knife. What happened to your face? We'll get her. Josif, move, move. Marko? - Get in. - All right. That fucking girl in there... Damn, the bitch. She's got my fucking gun. - So, Viktor, the house is locked down, yes? - Yes. I think not, my friend. What the hell is going on? This is my property. Smoke her out. - Goran. - Speak. Ground floor clear. Keep your eyes and ears open. She shot him. Now she's back in the vent. Bitch. What now? What now? Now we burn this fucking house down. What the fuck is that? Go, go, go, go! She's gone into the woods. Radios on. There. Watch him. What the fuck, Viktor? It's all right. It's me. It's me. I won't hurt you. We don't have time for this. If they find you... they will kill you. Let me help. You know I would never let anything happen to you. Just trust me. Please, Angel. Give me the knife. I won't let anyone hurt you. Have any ideal of what you've done? Any fucking idea? I kept you safe. I gave you a home. You fucking freak. How very touching. She is yours. We're even now. Oh, look at you. Always the corageous Viktor, hiding behind little girls. Don't point the fucking finger at me. All right. All right. Think. About the money. The money. How much did they offer you? And how much you propose for the loss of three of my men and for selling me out? 25 percent of all cash. You wil not have to do a thing. You insult me so before you die? Last chance to make me smile. All right! Half. So! Now, we can lower our weapons? Josif. You fuck! Josif. Stay with me, look at me. My beautiful brother. That looks very painful, Viktor. Here. Lexi, is Goran. You stay here. Sit. Did he touch you? Did he try to have sex with you? Then why did you do it? Listen to me. Get out. Lock the door. That's right. Come here. Come here and help me. Come help me. Please help me and I'll do anything for you. Do you understand? Do you understand what I'm saying? I'll do everything for you. Get me out of here, please. Please. Get me out of here. Get me out of here. What you're doing? What you're doing? What you're doing? Help. Help me. I need help out here. Come out. Lets get her in. She's just... You're safe now. You're safe now.
