And greet them. And greet them. And say hello again. Come on baby, come over here. You do your goddamn job! You tell that motherfucker he owes me $75 for this and to brush his goddamn teeth! Fucking cocksucker. Avoid guys in baseball caps because they're broke. And they spend the entire time trying to finger-fuck you. Stupid ass. What are you covering up? Oh, I just have uhh... these... spider bites. You got bit in here? Let me see. Where? I don't see anything. Well they're... it's better now, they were worse before - Can you tighten this for me? - Yeah. Do it tight. Make it look like I don't eat bread and shit... Girl, I swear I stopped dancing in Vegas so I wouldn't have to deal with these bastards. You know I danced for a guy tonight in a wheelchair, said it was his birthday and he was gonna fuck me in the ass. I swear to Christ, all men are the fucking same. Too bad these motherfuckers don't know I like pussy. Stupid asses. - You not finished? - Yeah, here ya go. - Thanks. - You're welcome. You're new here right? Yeah. So what's your name? Venus. - You're real name, bitch. - It's Venus. Oh, well I'm Jupiter, nice to meet you. I'm just fucking with you. I'm Chanel. Well, Bethany, but fuck that, right? Ain't nobody trying to buy no dance from no bitch named Bethany. You must clean up in here? I do okay. What's okay? Like $100 to $200 a night, maybe. That's fucking ridiculous. You might as well wait goddamn tables in this bitch. No stripper should be hurtin' for a cash. Do you know you can make just as much as an attorney if you play your cards right? So what's your game? Ummm, I walk around the room and if somebody wants a dance then No, no nah... Stop right there, I'm gonna help you... 'Cause you on that bullshit. This is a sales job, you have to know how to work these guys. Don't talk about their job, or their family, their little kids, their boring-ass reality, don't nobody want to hear that shit. You have to keep it all in fantasy. Talk about the new lotion you're wearing, the new lingerie you just bought, the hot chick you just made out with. Whatever, I don't give a shit. You just have to be dripping with sex. Because once you have a man turned on, that's when you can take all of his money. Scan the room, find a guy, lock eyes with him and stare at him like he's the only fucker in the goddamn room and then you empty his fucking wallet. You got it? Got it. Good. I'm just waiting for the next song to start. And then... and then I'll dance for you. Okay. Do you want to know what I did last week? What did you do? I made out with my friend Sophia. Really? Yep. And she's a... supermodel. From Italy. And... it was really hot because I've always wanted to do that. God, you look like my wife. Oh... Okay. I'm sorry. That was... that was a bit weird. - It's just... - It's okay. It's just amazing. You have the same eyes, the same mouth, the hair. The only thing different was she was a blonde. Oh, are you guys not together anymore? No. We're not. Why? I mean, um, if it's too personal it's okay, you don't have to tell me. It's... it's okay... She died. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I... I didn't know. It's... it's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry, it's... I'm obviously not very good at this. That's okay. - Maybe I should just sort of leave... - No. - Then come back and start again. - No. No? - No, no don't do that, stay. - Okay. Yeah, I like you here, actually. I was born in New York City. I love dark chocolate. And my left foot is half a size bigger than the right. Done... Check! Oh. I should never have told you. I know, you should not have ever have told me. So, why on earth would you leave an exotic place like Australia? Exotic? I don't know about that? Hmm. Look, I never really planned on leaving Australia. I uhh... I got a shoot out here. I'm a photographer, and um... I... I fell in love, I got married and, I don't know. Yeah... So you're a photographer? Um hm. Okay, well... Maybe you'd like to take my picture sometime? I guess this means we'd have to see each other again then. Umm, yeah... That sounds like a good idea. Hi. Hi. You look amazing. Thank you. I hope you like dark chocolate. Um, why don't you come in. Thank you. Wow, looks like another world in here. That's the point. I...made us a cheese plate, with some strawberries and, um some wine, I, I didn't know... if may be you wanted some right away, or... if maybe you wanted some... So have you had a girlfriend? Since, ya know... A few short-lived things. But nothing really. Can I ask you what your wife's name was? It was Victoria. How did... she? I'm sorry, I... No, it's okay, it's okay. She killed herself. What happened? She uhh... She uhh, she cut her wrists... in the bath. By the time I got there it was too late. There was no point in taking her to the hospital. She was very depressed. Ya know, she would... she would go to bed early, she would sleep all the time, ya know? We wouldn't talk at dinner. She stopped doing the things she sort of loved to do. She quit her job and... and in a way it felt like she quit me. Like, I'd come home from work and... there she'd be... in a white slip, with a book in her hand, but not really reading it... Ya know... so we, ya know, went to a couples therapy they... they diagnosed her with depression. And then I got a job offer in Madrid. And I uhh... I cheated on her, with some intern, I... can't even remember the name of her, ya know? When I got back she was dead. It's not your fault, Brian. I shouldn't have left her. Are you scared of loving again? Not anymore. You don't even know me. Doesn't even know what you fucking said! Hey. Hey, handsome. Whoa... Babe... Sweetheart, sweetheart, wait a second, wait a second... I'm sorry, I'm just... I just had a long day, ya know? I haven't eaten much. Well, what if I make you some of that fusilli pasta that you like? Babe... I think I just gotta go to sleep. Okay. Hey, it's me. I just got back. Crazy trip, I have so much to tell you. Anyway, umm, I've been thinking about you and I'd love to see you, so give me a call when you can. Bye. Red is so nice. Yeah, it's soft too. It's good quality. It will last you. Everything in your shop is good quality, I love coming here. How long have you been coming here? Since you've been open. And you can't stop me... I want these too, they're very soft. Uhh, don't look now but... that Venus chick, is here. You know, I heard she was a ballet dancer In like Paris or something Yeah, yeah, yeah, and she got kicked out. I wonder why do you think? Why? And now she's like a stripper. Venus cannot be her real name. She came in here drunk one time. - In the store? - In the store. You should have kicked her out. It was crazy what was I gonna do? I can't just kick somebody out of my store. But that's a really good gift for your neice. Yeah, she started journaling and so I, I want to encourage that, ya know? I mean, kids these day, if you can get them writing Hello. I'm so alone... Lonely. I miss you baby. I miss you so. I miss you baby. I could die. How is it? It's great. It's great. Hmm, good. I got you something today... But you have to close your eyes... Just do it, come on. Okay... Two seconds. Bri... Okay, open. Do you know what that is? Uhhh... No. That's me. Okay. That's Venus De Milo. She's the goddess of love... You know I was named after her. Thank you. That's nice. You're welcome. - Hey, Bri? - Yeah. I know you said it's bad luck for people to look at your photos before your show... but can I please see them? I don't have them framed yet. I don't care about frames, it's okay. Okay. Okay... Cool. Jesus, they're amazing. Why do they all have masks? I don't know. Mascarade theme, I guess. Hmm... This one is stunning. Thank you. Very proud of that one. See how she's turning away? Sort of sad, but... I don't know, inviting at the same time. Who is she? Uhh, an old friend, Christine. Known her for years. Hmm. Hey, Bri? Yeah. How do you know Christine? She was, uhh... friends with my wife. She was her best friend. What's the matter? - Does she live around here? - Yeah. Okay... What does she do? She, uhh... she owns an antique store here in town. Oh. Did you guys ever hook up? When Victoria passed away, we had a short-lived thing. Ya know, we got close. Ya know we were both mourning the same person, it sort of connected us. But I never loved her. Ya know, it was just something that happened a long time ago. And now we're just friends. I promise. Hey, Bri? Yeah. I want you to photograph me. Okay. What if I turn a little bit? And face the window? That's fine. Something like this. Let's lose the mask. I uhh... I don't think it's working on this one. Okay. We got it. Really? That's it. We got the shot. We just started though? We only need that one shot... We just got it. Okay. Do you want to get some sushi? Uhh... Got a really busy day. Okay, I could umm, come back later, we could do dinner? I can make you some pasta and we can have some red wine? Umm... Got a lot of meetings tonight, ya know? Work stuff, so... That's fine, I should probably work... anyway. Qu'est ce tu en pense? Bravo. Now if you wanted to say that you agree you would say, Je suis d'accord. Excellent. If you did not agree you would say... - Hey, how are you? - Christine, hey. - So good to see you. - So good to see you too. Oh, thank you. Let's get your coat off. Oh, yeah. You're looking slick and slender there. Oh yeah, wow. Get the fuck outta my way. Jesus! Watch it, bitch! Fuck off! Motherfucker! Shit, look at this... What's up baby? Hey, where you going? Fucking crazy bitch! Fuck. Hello. Can I come up? Fine. Can I come in? Come in. You wanna sit down? So, what's up? I got your note. Why did you follow me? Why did you lie to me? Because you wouldn't have understood, and I didn't want to fight. Look, Christine has a boyfriend, okay? And we're just friends. Look, Venus, this is hard, like... I really care about you. I just can't see you anymore. The truth of it is... I'm just not over my wife. I try to be, I do... I'm just not. I fell for you, Venus, I really did... but with the way things are... I need to be alone... Venus? I'm gonna go, okay? Wait! Wait. Venus. Venus, Venus... Venus, Venus... I can't do this. Okay? I'm sorry. I gotta go. Hey it's Brian here, uhh, sorry I missed your call. Leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Scotch on the rocks. You're supposed to look at me when you toast, didn't you ever hear that? Ahh, sorry, it was burning. It's bad luck if you don't do that, so now we're cursed. - I can live with that. - Yeah... Okay. Are you sure? Um hm. So do you think all women are whores? Only the good ones. What does that mean? You gotta kiss an angel good morning and love her like the devil when you get back home The devil... the devil, that's good. - You like the devil? - That's really good. I'll bet you do like the devil. I gotta go to the little girl's room. Hey, hey! What's the matter? Come on. Stop for a sec. Hey, hey, can you just stop? Hey! Hey! AHHHH! Fuck! Stupid cunt! You'll fucking listen now, bitch. Hi. You must be Venus. I would have come by earlier but Brian says you work pretty late, so I figured I'd give you some time to sleep in... Oh... Your stuff... from the house. Brian's feeling really weird about everything as I'm sure you are too, so I thought I'd make it easier on both of you. Look, I know this must be hard. But honestly it's for the best. Brian's very... complex, Sometimes he just needs to be alone. He's in a lot of pain since Victoria died. Highs and lows, drinking, depression, the occasional fling at the strip club... he's just very... lost. And I'm really... the only one who... knows how to take care of him. Fucking bitch. Fuck. I go, YOU go. He said, no fuck you, you put me in there, I didn't put you in there! You put me in there 'cause you fucking told me. And I said shit, fuck you, who are you? Who are you? Get outta my house! Get outta my house! Hi sweetie, I missed you. You wanna go outside? Hey, it's me. I just got back, I guess you're busy. Anyway, I'm just hanging out. I'll do some yoga, take a bath... maybe... touch myself a little, thinking about you... Anyway uhh, give me call when you can. Bye, sexy. "Love, Venus." I'll call you back. Oh! Oh... Oh... Oh, okay... Oh... Get your hands off me. Alright, yeah, okay... Um hm... Hey... look at me. I am looking at you. Uh-uh, mister... look at ME. Here. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. You wanna touch me? Yeah, yeah. Do it. You sure? I can touch you? - Do it. - I can touch you right? Touch me. Not there. Okay... Right here... right here? - Um hm. - Touch you here? You like that? Um hm. Okay, oh... Yeah, Okay, yeah... Okay... What the fuck is this? What did I fucking tell you?! You piece of shit! Fucking look at me! You think's she's okay? Rough night. Holy shit. She's really messed up. Venus, are you okay? Honey? Girl, what's wrong with you? Are you okay? Venus? Venus, look at me. Venus? Hey! Hey... hey! Girl, what the fuck happened out there? Are you high? Venus! I told you to get the fuck outta here. You're fired! Alright, I'm get her outta here, just give me a moment, okay? She's got five minutes or I'm calling the cops. Alright, I got it. Girl, come on let's go. Let's get you outta here, you hungry? Come on, come on. Hi. Hi... I uhhh... I just, I just wanted to call. I was thinking about you. I miss you. I miss you too, Brian. What are you doing? Drinking. Listen, I'm uhh... I'm sorry, about everything, Venus, I uhh... What can I say I'm fucking just a piece of shit, ya know? I just... I just can't hold on to anything that's good. You're not a piece of shit, Brian, you're just... you're just really, really hurting. You've been through so much, you know? She uhh... she didn't even leave a goddamn note. I know... I don't think you should be alone right now. Let me come and see you. I uhh... I wanted to love you, Venus. I know... Nobody's ever loved me the way that you have... I'm gonna come by and uhh, we're just gonna talk, okay? That's it, we'll just talk. Okay. Okay. Okay. Open the fucking door, bitch! Get out here! Open the fucking door, bitch! Get the fuck out here! You're gonna pay for what you did. Get the fuck out here right now, bitch! I'm gonna see you, on the moon, and I don't care! Light in your face... and I don't... You kill my fucking cat?! What the fuck's wrong with you?! Fuck, fuck, fuck... fuck, fuck... fuck. Pull over! Get out of the fucking car! Get out you little bitch! Get the fuck out of the car! What are you doing? Gaahhhh, fucking bitch! Fucking bitch! Fuck. You wanna do this? You wanna fucking do this? We're gonna do this. That's a good girl. Get out of the fucking car! I said get out of the fucking car you piece of shit! What the fuck is wrong with... Fuck. Hi, I'm leaving in five... Venus, look I've been trying to call you, okay? I shouldn't have agreed to you coming over in the first place. It's just... it just wasn't a good idea. Venus look, I just can't do this, okay? Brian... No, Venus listen to me. I know you're hurting. You're fucking being selfish, okay? This isn't about your feelings. You wish things were different, fucking... I wish things were different. Brian, please. I wish Victoria didn't fucking kill herself but she did. My wife killed herself and I miss her every single fucking day! I just... I just need you to go away. I just need to be alone. Please, Venus, just leave me alone. - Hey. - Hey, I need a favor. Hey it's Cha... Hey. I'm here. Venus? Venus? Earth to Venus. You performing live tonight, bitch? The fuck you gonna do with this? You thinking about going blonde? I see that for you. Hey? Venus? Girl, what's wrong with you? Did you take something? Venus, talk to me girl, what's wrong? Alright, come on, we'll sit down, smoke a fag and calm down, wait, where you going? To see Brian. Dressed like that? Girl seriously, this guy got you upset and you're acting stupid. No man should have you're head all messed up like that. Come on, Venus, you remember what I told you? Venus? Venus? Never date a man you meet at the fucking club, he got your head all fucked up. He dated your ass for months, he made you fall in love with him, and then he dropped your ass. That doesn't sound like a man, Venus, that sound like a fucking pussy to me! Shit! Fuck! 911, where is your emergency? Yeah, I'm in an apartment and there, and there's a dead body here. Okay mam, I need you to slow down and I need you to tell me exactly... I know who did it, her name is Venus. She just left and I know where she's going. Don't move! Freeze! You're under arrest! Brian! Brian! No! Brian! What happened in Paris? What do you mean? Well, you were dancing at the Paris ballet studio... Can you tell me what happened there? I was dancing in a show. But you were removed from the company. Do you remember why? I'm looking at an article here, and it says, a Sterling ballet school alum, Venus Noella, has allegedly pushed fellow ballet dancer Thomas Pagan down a flight of stairs at the Paris ballet studio following the evening's performance. Thomas is currently in intensive care and is speculated to be paralyzed from the wasit down. Now, I uhh, I understand no charges were filed due to lack of evidence. When did you last speak to Doctor Kardash? I just want to talk to Brian. I have someone waiting outside. I'd like to bring them in now. Please come in. Venus? Have you ever met this woman? Yes. No... Venus, we've never met. You followed me, to the desert. I was never in the desert with you. You're still fucking Brian, aren't you? No. I saw you... fucking him, in his house. I have a boyfriend... I would never cheat on him. I don't know what you saw. The last time I saw Brian, we were having dinner. He told me he was seeing someone, but he wanted to end it. And then I... got home from work the next night. The doorbell rings. That's when I found my cat. And then shortly after, a detective shows up at my door saying that a woman named Venus was arrested, claiming that she killed me. That's when I found out what happened. And that's why I'm here. Because I want you to know what you did. Venus? Venus? When you were arrested, you were found inside Brian's house, what were you doing there? I was with Brian. We were... we were making love. No. You were alone. I need you to look at this photograph now. Venus? Venus, Venus! Venus... Venus! I can't do this. Okay? I'm sorry... I gotta go.
