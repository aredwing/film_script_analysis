Whiping their slates clean and starting over is some people's dream. For me it was the beginning of a nightmare. My face was the face of a stranger. I had no idea who the man in the mirror was. I studied him for a long time as he stared back at me. It seem to be something familiar about his eyes. No wallet, no ID. The man was dead. Somehow I knew that. POLICE Detective Rodney Krumb. Now I knew the dead men's name. I still couldn't remember mine. Krumb was shot right between his eyes. If I killed him, I was pretty handy with a gun. A perfect fit. That settles it, I'm a cop killer. Shots fired in the vicinity of the Hollywood Sign. Units in the area proceed there at once. I didn't know why I did what I did but I knew I had to be gone before the police arrived. The gun was mine, car was obviously his. As I drove away I had nothing but questions. I wondered how I got there? Did I get a ride with him? Or was my car parked nearby? I wodered if I'd ever get to know my own name. There was only one thing that seems certain. I was the bad guy in this story. Subtitle by mobutu I drove arround for almost an hour. I kept thinking I'll see something that'll jug my memory. I knew I could't stay in this car forever. Police will be looking for it. One thing I was sure of: If I go to Rodney's place he won't be home. Surprise! Mommy? Mommy? Where is daddy? I don't get it. Why are you driving Rodney's car? Well, you know Rodney ... he kind of suspected you might be planning something. He wanted me to check if there's a surprise party and let him know. Well, you better get on the damn phone and tell him there's no party. Rodney Cell Phone It's ringing. Yes? Hey, Rod, it's me. - Detective Krumb can't come to the phone right now. - Yeah, Rod, I'm at the house. - Sir, this is detective Riley speaking. - No man, there's no party, it's cool. - Sir, may I ask who I am speaking to? - Tell you man, the coast it's clear. Sir, I insist that you identify yourself. Sure, of course. See you in a few buddy. He's coming. - Where did he go? - I think he might be outside. - There he is! - Get him! - Freeze! - L.A.P.D., stop! - Put your hands in the air! - Stop or I'll shoot! Yeah? - Ruben? - Yes? - It's me. - Yes. It's done. The rest of the money will be paid into your account as agreed. I see. It was a pleasure doing business with you Mr. Ruben. If I ever need a private detective again I'll be sure to give you a call. - Thank you. - Oh, no no no, thank you. Listen, do you mind if I ask you a question? 17-25, code 6. Detective Riley speaking. Yes, there is detective Krumb's car. No, the suspect's long gone. No, sir. I'll be sure to report any developments. Sam Ruben Private Investigator Sam Ruben Private Investigator Come in please. - Hello! - Hello! - Do you know me? - Should I? - I guess not. Is Mr. Ruben in? - No. What is this about? - It's private. Do you expect him back soon? - No. I'll make sure to tell him you were here when he calls. Yeah, that'll be kind of hard to do since I didn't give you my name. Hello? Sam, this is Samantha. He was just here. - Who was? - Hudson. Hudson was just at the office. He asked if I knew who he was. - Hudson who? - Sam, that's not funny. - What are you gonna do about it? - Guess I'll have to do whatever it takes. Tell you what ... why don't you leave his file on my desk, I'll stop by later tonight to pick it up? Tell you what ... I could take the file back to my place, and you can stop by later tonight pick it up, pop yourself to whatever house you might desire ... - I'm kind of busy, kid. - Sam, it's been a long time ... - I miss you. - I know, I miss you too. - I'll leave the file on your desk. - Good. And I'll stop by to see you real soon. Hudson, David Last Seen: January 25 Last heard from: February 3 People to talk to: So now I had a name: David Hudson. I practice saying it: "Hello, I'm David Hudson" "Hi, I'm Dave" But no matter how many times I said it, the name still sounded foreign to me. Still, I can feel the excitement now, as I got closer to my home. Hello, Mr. Hudson! It's a pleasure to see you again. Your mail, sir. I must have been gone for a long time. I'm sorry, I seem to have forgotten your name. - It's Jones, sir. - Jones, Jones, right. - When it's a last time you saw me? - Well, it's been quite a while, sir. A week? Two weeks? More like several months, sir. What floor do I live on? Think, David, think. Wait a minute! My mail. I looked all over the place hoping to see something that'll jug my memory. No such luck. It's like staring at the mirror and getting no reflection. If I haven't been home in months where the hell have I been? Four messages. So either I'm not very popular, or I've been checking my messages. Hi, David, Angela. Give me a call when you get a chance. David, it's Angela. Where are you? I miss you. I've been a bad bad girl and only you can set me straight. Call me ... please. David, please, I've got to see you. I got the money. I'm ready, I need to see you, Ok? 555-7278. Call me. Or I'll have to go see someone else. And you know how you hate that. David, I had to run out to the store and I was afraid you may have called. If you have please call again. It's Angela, 555-7278 - David? - Hello. Is that all I get? It's been a long time. Whoever I was in my previous life, at least I got one thing right. - I love you. - I love you too. You say it like you mean it. - Why wouldn't I mean it? - I don't know ... It's just that ... I'll be right back. Hello? Mr. Ruben, this is Susan Lesko, David Hudson's next door neighbor. David is here, he is here with me at the apartment. - Who is? - David Hudson. - He is in his apartment right now. - You don't say! I can keep him busy for a while. How quickly can you get here? - Quicker than you think. - I've gotta go now. Mr. Ruben, you will remember to bring the money, right? Yeah, yeah I'll bring it. Hello, this is Susan Lesko, Mr. Hudson's neighbor. Yes, he is in the apartment right now. I can keep him busy for a while. You will remember to bring the money, right? Hi lover! - Who did you just called? - What do you mean? - Listen, I need to know who you called. - I didn't call anyone. I heard you make that call. Who did you call? Detective Ruben. David, I just ... The other call. Who else did you call? I don't know. - Listen, I don't wanna hurt you. - Now that would be a new one. What do you mean? - You're saying I did that? - You're saying you didn't? - About that other call ... - A man called me a couple of months ago, saying he would pay me $10.000 to let him know if you ever show up. He never gave me his name. All I have is a phone number. David, I'm sorry. After the way you treated me ... David, I love you. David I just wanna hear you say you love me. Like you did when we ... Come on! Susan, go home, lock the door behind you, call the police. - Don't let anyone in, OK? - OK. David, I'm sorry. I didn't know. - You can tell me that some other time. - Will there be another time? Well, first I'll have to get the hell out of here in one piece, won't I? We lost him. I think he is in elevator 1. He is in the parking area. Level 2 Mr. Hudson? We just want to talk. You got a funny way of showing it. Listen, we got you surrounded. You may as well come out and face us like a man. Yeah, maybe I can be a real man and take out as many of you assholes as I can. David please have more ammo. Fuck! One of the problems with having amnesia is that you have to start from scratch. You're as innocent as a newborn baby. And yet you've lived and made mistakes. When you don't remember who you were and how you lived before you set such high standards for yourself that is impossible to live up to them. Me, I was failling by even the most miserable of standards. Hello? - Hi Angela, it's David. - David, when can you be here? - I don't know. When do you want me there? - As soon as possible. - OK, how about I come right over? - That would be fine. I've got the money. - Good. Let me have the address. - You know the address. - Let me have it again. - 3540 North Beverly. I'll be there soon. And now with breaking news here's Jeff Norman. Jeff? As the hero cop Rodney Krumb was bury today, the autorities pledged they will not rest until the killer is brought to justice. A massive manhunt ... As I was driving towards Angela's house, I couldn't help but wonder What will be the next horror I'll discover about myself. You're here. Come on in. Money's on the table. Take it. - Aren't you gonna count it? - I trust you. - Did you bring the stuff? - You mean drugs? No. Then give me back my fucking money. I still want the session. I'm sure you can deliver that. I'm sorry about the drugs. I'll bring them next time. You're a regular one stop shopping for sin. Oh well, booze will have to do. How did you get these? You of all people should know. Come. You'll have to do the other hand. What's the matter? Get the whip. I'm in the mood for the heavier one. What are you doing? Where are the keys? What do you want with them? Not on the mouth. I am sorry. I hope you'll realize I'm not paying you for this shit. You can stay the night if you want to. Angela, I'm so sorry. Amnesia? That's cool. - Like we're in a good mistery or something. - I'm glad you approve. David, are you sure you wanna remember? It's not easy to live when you don't like yourself. I am who I am wether I remember it or not. I know. You seem to be doing well. Yeah, I guess I was doing well there for a while. All this is a mirage you know. Car is being repossesed and I defaulted on my mortgage payment I don't even know how many times. It's kind of hard to hold on to a job and pay bills when you have a full blown heroine habbit. I just don't understand why you would choose to remember. Angela, I have to. Someone is trying to kill me and I gotta know who and I gotta know why. - I'm sure many people want you dead. - Yourself included? Not right now. Angela, have you ever met a guy by the name of Sam Ruben? Yeah, he came to talk to me about you. Asked a lot of questions about you ... I didn't so I told him so ... There was something about the guy ... - What do you mean? - He had very kind eyes. He was an intimidating presence, for sure but he had very kind eyes. So you have no idea why this guy is trying to kill me? David, don't think of Ruben as a heavy guy You're the heavy guy. You are a very bad man.. You just don't remember it right now. I'm sure it will all come back to you. - People change you know. - I know. I did. The trouble is they usually change for the worse. Don't you think that for an "immoral and despicable asshole", I'm already doing better? I'm sorry I said those things. I had no right ... It's allright. The more I know about myself the less I like the guy. As I drove towards the next person on Sam Ruben's list, I've kept thinking of Angela's words. Was I sure I wanted to remember who I was? I had no other choice but to continue my search. If I wanted to have any kind of a future, I first had to uncover my past. Mrs. Lopez? - It's you! - Mam, I'm sorry to disturb you. I just want to ask you of a certain private detective by the name of Sam Ruben. - He was here asking questions about me? - Yes, he was here. I was glad to give him what he wanted. - And that was ... - As much dirt on you as possible. Yes, but what did he want to know specifically? What kind of animal are you? She's dead! Don't you even care that my little girl is dead? - Listen, I'm sure we can figure out ... - Get the fuck out of my house! What kind of animal are you? She's dead! Don't you even care that my little girl is dead? You're saying I did that? You're saying you didn't? Mommy? Mommy? Where is daddy? You are a very bad man. You just don't remember it right now. I'm sure it will all come back to you. Mr. Hudson? Mr. Da Vinci will see you now. Please go in. - Aah, just the man I wanted to see. - Really? Really. What can I do for you Mr. Hudson? I was hoping you can tell if a certain Sam Ruben came to see you some time ago, and what he wanted to know about me. OK, boys, it's time to take the garbage out. Yeah, he was here, asked about you. I said "How dare you mention that piece of shit in front of me?" Throw him out as well. And stay out. The more I thought about, the more I realize that I knew even less about Ruben than I did about myself. "Know your opponent" is one of the basic rule of war. I decided to follow it. I had a feeling Ruben wouldn't be home. Maybe it was more than a feeling. If you had to choose between being good or being lucky I'd take being lucky anytime. This was quickly turning into a case of obsession, but obsession of what? Was a piece of shit like me worth obsessing over for even a minute? Was Ruben trying to get revenge for something I've done? And if so, for what? I decided it was time I did what I should have done days ago - go see a doctor. - Where the hell were you, I was beginning to worry. - Worry about what? - Sam ... - Sam Ruben? - What the hell does he want from me? - Sam? Dr. Kaplansky, you got to help me. I got to find Ruben and why he has my whole life in his file. Tell you what Mr. Hudson, why don't you step into my office and we'll talk about the whole thing, calmly and rationally. - So, what do you it's going on? - I think Sam Ruben is trying to kill me. Sam ... Listen, I've known Sam Ruben for a long time. He may be a pain in the neck sometimes, he's a bit driven, he can be weird Then why does he have this file on me? - How come you have that file? - Because I took it. From his Office? - Yes! Did Sam Ruben give it to you? - He wasn't there. - How come you were there? Because ... It's a long story. - I'd like to hear it, we have time. - Listen, I'm not here to tell stories. I came to find out about Sam Ruben. Are you gonna tell me about him or do I have to force you? OK, you win. Let me go get his file. Let me see ... where is it ... - You see, I have a new assistant. - You better find it doc. Here it is. Wait a minute. This is the wrong file! - David, have you ever seen this man? - No. Help me. Please, help me. Krumb? This can't be happening, you're dead! I killed you! Some people worth more dead than alive. Ruben? It's me. - You have to find him again. - I already found him once. I know, but he got away. No se pode confiar num policial nem para uma simples execuo. - So Krumb was supposed to kill Hudson. - So you've seen the news reports. - You're a smart man mr. Ruben. - How much? You don't seem to mind that I was looking for Hudson to have him killed. - How much? - Double. And I'll double that if you take care of Hudson yourself. - Why? - What do you mean? - Why does Hudson have to die? - What's your point? - That's not the way I operate. - What do you care? The man is a scumbag. Tortures people for a living, and blackmail. - Hudson is a piece of shit, isn't he? - All I'm asking you is to do the world a favor. I guess you're right. I don't know much about David Hudson. But the man you describe deserves to die. - Where do you want him delivered? - You mean you can do it just like that? Just like that. - Long Beach harbour, pier 27, midnight. - He'll be there. - Voc estar l? - No. Vou estar ocupado. I thought I just found your body. That Ruben will take care of you. We both agreed that you should do your own dirty work. My pleasure. Besides it'll save me half the money - Why do you want me dead? - You know why. Even if he gave me the tape, I could never be certain that you didn't make a copy. As my personal trainer ofen tells me: To live without stress, you have to eliminate the cause of stress. And that would be me? You bet your sweet ass that it would be you. - You came alone? - I never do. You made me look bad. And I don't like looking bad. I belive this is my ?. As it is turns out, yours as well. Take it down. Lower. Lower. Let's go to the other side. Where the hell did he go? Shit! Back to the other end. Hurry, hurry! Fuck! And you're telling me that your best offer is giving me this piece of shit and $.1000 for a brand new BMW? A brand new BMW with 7 bullet holes in it. I'll go to the police but I'm too busy right now. If you're busy then I should go to other dealer. Tell you what. I'll give you this fine automobile and $1.000. But that's what you already offer. Yes but a $200 processing fee was to be deducted from that. You seem like a nice fellow so I'll just leave that. - I didn't realize there is a fee. - There is not anymore. I see that they don't call you Honest George for nothing. As I always say: Honesty is the best policy. George, you got yourself a deal. I just love making people happy. And make sure to get all of your things. I don't want you coming back saying you had a 15.000 watch in the glove compartment. Are you fucking nuts? What are you doing here? Pardon me? Anyone sees me talking to you I'm dead. So you know me? Really funny! - I need to talk to you. - Not now. Later. I don't know what's going on but I'll be glad to get rid of the damn key. - Someone else looking for it? - Are you kidding? - Hovering arround for days after you were gone. - They? How the hell would I know who they were? - I thought you would know. - I have a very good ideea. - Which you will not share with me? - Maybe some other time. Missed you. - Where the hell were you all this time? - Away. I better take the key and be gone. - Give it to me. - You'll have to find it first. Give it to me, I'm not joking Listen, this is serious. I can see how serious it is. Oh hell. Who the hell are you? - Sharon? He killed Sharon? - No, you don't understand. What is it we don't understand? That you killed her you fucking asshole? Shit! - Where did he go? - I think he went that way. OK girls let's go get him. I'm gonna fucking rip his balls off. Shit! He's down in that alley. I've seen him run that way. There he is girls. Go for the eye. Fucking asshole! Officers, officers, over here! I'm the man you want. I'm over here behind the dumpster. OK ladies step aside. You! Drop your weapon. Slowly. ok ok everyone step back. we got him now. Once again. How long did you know Sharon Miller? I don't know. - Why did you go backstage? - She invited me back there. And then she just happened to be killed by a misterious stranger, while you were standing there innocently showing her your ... gun? As difficult as you find that to believe ... By the same man who tried to kill you in your appartment, 2 nights ago. Yes! - But you have no idea who the man is. - No. At which point you were aprehended by a mean bunch of nude strippers. At which point having nothing to fear. I surrended myself to the proper authorities. OK, let's go over it once again. You go into the night club and ... - Your hands. What happened to your hands? - What do you mean? - Did they burn in a fire or something? - I don't know. - Were they dipped in acid? - I don't remember. Makes it difficult to check your fingerprints. - Who the hell are you? - Look, I told you, I have amnesia. I remember nothing of my life except a few days ago. Please understand, I'm not trying to be difficult. I'm pretty sure my name is David Hudson. My address is 3355 Galaxy Way. David Robert Hudson, social security number you are using, died in Huntsville, Alabama, And he was african-american. This is his death certificate. You can forget about that bail you were asking me about. You're not going anywhere until we find out exactly who you are and what the hell you're trying to hide. Subtitle by mobutu David Robert Hudson, social security number you are using, died in Huntsville, Alabama, Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? David, are you sure you want to remember? Not easy to live when you don't like yourself. What kind of animal are you? Look out! Get down! Good. Let's get the hell out of here. Scuse me . How do I get into my safe deposit box? Just a second sir. I'll get the manager. - How can I help you sir? - I need to get into my safe deposit box. - Please, it's urgent. - Of course sir. What's the name on the account please? Name ... it's David Hudson. I'm sorry sir but i'm afraid that we don't have an account with that name. - Are you sure that's the correct name? - It's what my friend told me. Listen, it's urgent. I have the key, it doesn't mean anything? It probably means I should be calling the police. Mr. Hudson? Sam? This is Dr. Kaplansky. We need to speak, urgent. Call me. - Who are you? - David Hudson. Question is who the fuck are you? David Hudson is dead. He died 32 years ago at age 3. There goes a perfectly good alias. It's hard to enjoy life when so many people want you dead. Thanks for providing a solution to my problem. Your body will do quite nicely. Don't you wanna know who I am? I am kind of curious but not enough to listen to your story. I'm really much more interested in what you're about to become. A body of the dearly departed David Hudson. I always wanted to go to my own funeral. No, not the face. After all we want Stern to be certain I'm dead. Some people are worth more dead than alive. Hello, Mr. Hudson. I've been down every road and every alley. The man simply will not be found. I tell you, this is the only way. Sam, we've been friends for a long time. If you want me to give you David Hudson's face I will. The process is long and painfull and the results are uncertain. Are you sure you want to go through with that? I will miss this face but a million bucks will make it so much easier to forget. What are you gonna do with all that money? Samantha, first I get to find the man. Have you ever seen this man? No. Find him and I'll pay you a million bucks. Sam Ruben. What can I do for you? David, please don't die. Please don't die, David. David, I love you. My name is Ruben. Sam Ruben. Sam, I came as soon as I ... What the hell is going on? Where is Sam? Samanta, it's OK. It's me, Sam. What kind of sick joke is this? It's me. Your favourite colour it's green. Your favourite food is Thai. You take your coffe straight black no sugar. Your dog Sparky died when you were 7. and you haven't had the nerve to have other pets since. Even the tinyest kiss on that tender little spot behind your right ear just drives you wild. It'll be allright now. It will be allright. Young lady what are you doing here? It's OK doctor, I asked her to come. When he phoned me, saying he was in the hospital ... You phoned her? From this telephone? Nurse Williams this is Dr. Barnes, at extension 357. Disconnect this line, please. Mr. Hudson, you may not realize it and you certainly not acting like it, but you're a very sick man. Now you may plan to give up and die on me but I won't let you. You may feel that you have the right to use that telephone but you're my patient and that means that you have no rights. She's in my hospital and that means that she doesn't either. Young lady this man is very sick. You'll have to leave right now. - But I was only ... - That's right now as in right now! Or do I have to call security? I'll be back. Hello, this is Samantha Jordan. - And where do you think you're going? - Detective Riley, L.A.P.D. I need to speak with Mr. Hudson right now. Detective Riley, that's a pretty little badge. But this is my hospital and Mr. Hudson is my patient. This is a police matter and Mr. Hudson is my suspect. And you'll have plenty of time to interview him as soon as he feels better. I will let you know when the times comes. OK, but I'm gonna post 2 of my men at that door. No one comes in and no one comes out. Except for you and your stuff of course. Shit! - 250. - 250. - Still weak. - Come on, come on. - 300. - 300. Clear it! - No change. - Not on my watch. Come on, come on. - 360. - Clear it! Mr. Hudson you've been advised of your rights. Dr. Barnes tells me you wanna talk to me. He says you're ready to talk. So talk. I think I should start by telling you who I am. And I think that's an excellent idea! My name is Sam Ruben i'm a private investigator. Now, here's a problem. You don't look like Sam Ruben. That's because I had plastic surgery to make me look like David Hudson. Why? You may want to think very carefully before you continue with your story. You see, we know that Sam Ruben is dead. The cost guard fished him out the long beach harbour last week. - He was burried just a few days ago. - I'm not dead. You're not. Sam Ruben is. Which makes you not Sam Ruben. Come on Riley, even you are not that stupid. Call Samantha Jordan, my secretary. She'll confirm who I am. And I would do that gladly. The only problem is she is the one who identified Ruben's body. What the hell's going on here? That's what I like you to tell me. OK, here's what you do: talk to Dr. Kaplansky. He's the one who performed the operation. Hehe, you sure can pick'em! Dr. Kaplanski was killed in a hold'up last week. It made all the papers. Hudson, what the hell are you doing out of bed? Hello Dr. Barnes, I feel much better. I think I'll be checking out now. Mr. Hudson, this is my hospital and you're my patient. You are not feeling better until I say you're feeling better. Dr. Barnes, I'm afraid I have to insist. Good night, Dr. Barnes. Good night. So finally I found David Hudson. Looks like Stern's men got to him first. Hi, this is Samantha. I'll be gone for a long long time. You can leave me a message if you want to but I don't think I'll be checking 'em anytime soon. If ever. Samantha? If I were you I wouldn't expect any calls from her. Stern. What have you done with her? Mr. Ruben, I don't like being cheated. Now that you're dead you'll never be able to put your hands on my money. - You killed her didn't you? - She said she wanted to be taken care of for life. - She was just a kid. - Who sold you out without remorse. It's just that you have way too much money. And too much money will make a bad person of just about anyone. Money doesn't make people bad. It just allows what's inside to come up to the surface. - What about Dr. Kaplansky? - What about him? - You killed him. - Mr. Ruben, I don't kill people. - My people kill people. - And Hudson? Let's just say that Mr. Hudson was killed by his own amazing stupidity. When will you learn that some people are not to be toyed with? You won't get away with it, you know. There are things like DNA tests. Yes but those are for people who live long enough to get them done. Accept it Ruben, you can't touch my money and you can't touch me. But I wouldn't worry about if I were you. You'll get yours. I don't think we will be speaking again. Goodbye. What happened? Where is your stuff? They took it all away. I have to move out by the end of the week. Where are you gonna go? I don't think that it really matters. It matters ... to me. We now go live to Robert Clancy, who is at the scene. The police say that David Hudson, southern California's most wanted man, manage to overpower 2 policemen and the doctor in charge and to bypass the hospital sofisticated security system, as he pulled off one of the most daring escapes in the city history. Wanted in connection with the murder of exotic dancer Sharon Miller on the night of october 15th, Hudson is considered armed and dangerous. In other news Bobo the beloved clown who had entertained children of all ages ... I'm not David Hudson, you know? Plastic surgery to make me look like him. Good. Now I feel better about starting to like you. - Aren't you even gonna ask me who I am? - You're Sam Ruben aren't you? I had a feeling the last time you were here, But when you started asking questions about yourself ... I got a little messed up, being shot in the head and all. Could you turn that up please? The stars gather last night at the Pavillion to honour Randall Stern, known as "Friend in Need", as he received his second "Hollywood Humanitarian of The Year" award. Humble as always he commented only by saying: I was only doing what anyone in my position would have done. - Fucking asshole. - You know Randall Stern? Thru David ... he used to brag about making a snuff film for some rich guy I always thought it was Stern. Stern is the one who hired me to find David. - The one who wanted him dead. - Figures. David also bragged about arranging for a secret camera to tape the scene from a different angle, showing the mens faces that participated on the killing. Angela, you know where that tape might be? No. But it could be at the dungeon. Angela, did you know the girl? I knew that one of David's girl was missing. I always thought it was her. - Was her name Lopez? - Virginia Lopez. And I think she would have agree to do it even if she knew what was coming to her. Did you ever talked to David about it? I asked him about her once. He said he could always arrange for me to star in his next production. - You've done it? - No. I don't think I would. Not now anyway. - What did you tell him? - That I lost the keys. I'm still David Hudson remember? Thank god the old man doesn't watch TV. I think that's where the other camera is hidden. A couple of VCR's in the back room. - Nothing? - Nothing. Guess that's that. Let's get the hell out of here. To tell you the truth this place gives me the creeps. - What is that? - What? - Do you mind if I take some of this stuff? - Be my guest. - Where are we going to next? - You're going home. Me, I have something I gotta do. Do you mind if I use your cell phone for a minute? Hi buddy it's Sam Ruben. To quote the reports of my demise I ask you is that the way to talk about the dead?
