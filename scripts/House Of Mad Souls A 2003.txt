He'll go back home soon. Excuse me. Thank you everyone, you've all been so great to me while I've been here! We wish you luck. If you miss us, come visit us again. Come back to me please. I'm cold! Come back to me please. I'm cold! Come back to me please. I'm cold! My sister, I just love you. Bass, I'm sorry. I shouldn't leave him. What are you doing here, doctor? Oh! It's you! I've come to search for a patient's record. Why don't you get someone else to do it? It's an old patient's record of many years ago, sir. So I want to find it myself. What makes you so interested in it? It's about this boy, sir. Do you also know this boy? I don't want to talk about him. Please! I have to find out what happened to him! OK! It happened when I first started here This boy's case made all of us very frustrated. Bass shut himself in the room and refuses to eat or talk to anyone. We had lots of patients but few doctors. We couldn't takecare of them all. Doctor Mongkol tried to cure him but he refused everything until his body couldn't take it. So he passed away when he was young. Why? Who am I gonna live with? Son! Get up, son. Why do you leave me? Doctor Mongkol can not save him too. Bass' father was a doctor too, and he helped cure many patients, But couldn't cure his own son. We all did our best to help him, but we just couldn't. Eat some more, it'll do you good. One day, I'll be strong enough to carry you around! Are you sure? I'm pretty heavy you know! If I eat all the food, and medicine you give me, one day I'll be able to. I tell you. There're only two people I love in this world. My dad and you. Good boy. Doctor, are you OK? Yeah, what else happened? After Bass's death, Dr. Mongkol went insane, and the hospital was in chaos. Where? Where is it? No! Where is it? Where? Where is it? No! Where is it? Where? Where is it? No! Where is it? Bass's Bass's Bass's, please eat something. You'll revive to talk with me, play with me and go around with me. Is it good? Why don't you eat? Hey! Wake up my son. Son! Who am I gonna live with? Don't be afraid, I'll make a new formula. Never mind. Don't leave me. Son! It was then Dr. Mongkol was been forced to leave from the hospital, he was too emotional to continue working here. After he left, all our top doctors left with him, and the hospital was left barely running, No one wanted to come here anymore. Since his son died, no one has step foot outside of the house. I've only seen them come out once. Sorry to keep you waiting. That's ok. I'm a pediatrician at the hospital. My name is Jitta. You may not remember me. I used to be an intern student at the hospital. So you're Bass' beloved nurse. He'll be glad to know that you came to visit him. Bass, look who it is. Do you remember Jitta? Bass, look who it is. look who it is. Doctor, are you crazy? You're son has been dead for 8 years! No! He's not dead! Because of the medicine I have created, my son is immortal! All you did was torture his poor spirit, it prevents him from being reborn! Go away! Leave us alone! My son isn't dead! Don't be frightened. I sent her away. Don't be frightened. Are you cold? I'll cover you. I love you. I promise that I'll help you this time. Come back to me please. I'm cold. Cold Don't be scared, son. I promise, nobody will hurt you. Y. Are you tired? I'll clean your bod After that, I'll tell you a tale. It's a very good story. I'll tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a prince named He lived with his father... Are you cold? Here's another blanket. What? Are you still cold? Stay here! I told you to leave us alone! I swear, I'll call the police! Listen to me please, doctor. What you did is not right! So what is right? What mistake did he make? Why did he die so young? Go back! Stop tormenting our family. My life has been a happy one. You say you're happy. But do you know Bass has never been happy. He has to live like a wandering spirit. He has no chance to be reborn. Shut up! Go back! I tell you the truth. This may sound strange doctor, but Bass' spirit visits me as if he wants me to do something. It's good to see you again. Hey, something on your mind? I'm thinking of a boy I saw, his face looked like yours Do you remember him? It's a long time ago. Bad memories arent worth remembering. Who are you? Have we met before? Did you really see Bass? I saw him recently, and because we knew each other a long time ago, I recognized his face. He appeared so many times which made me wonder about what happened, so I found his records from the hospital when I learned he had died 8 years ago, I came to this house. I think he wants me to help release his spirit from his body, so he can be reborn again. I believe you have to let his spirit go, I just wanted to tell you this, I've done all I can and the decision is yours now, but please, you must face reality, your son is gone, and yourself now, without him. Bass' mother died giving birth to Bass. I worked hard all my life to provide all that I could for Bass. Bass had his mother's spirit in him. When he got sick, I tried my hardest to cure him, after all, I was able to cure almost everyone else. But I couldn't cure my only son. When he died, I could feel it, and I couldn't stand losing him. Today, I'll tell you about Pang Pond. It's very funny. I'm Pang Pond's dad. Pang Pond made a robot. I asked "what are you doing?" He brought it to school. Today he's a very good boy. Today, someone is gonna grab I the robot from Pang Pond. He laughs. Your dad will manage it. Pang Pond is in fact daddy's Bass. I had no idea it was torturing his soul. I'm sorry, son. I'm cold cold Come back to me please. I'm cold. I give you this so you'll feel that I'm always with you. When I recover, you must take me to the sea as promised, alright? Of course, I promise. But after you rest. It's good to see you again. Hey, something on your mind? I'm thinking of a boy I saw, his face looked like yours Do you remember him? It's a long time ago. Bad memories arent worth remembering. You're right. When was the last time you were here? A long time ago. Where do you go? Stay with me please. I'm scared. Don't be scared, honey. I have to go now Wait! Will I see you again? It's a waste of time. All you do is work. Have you ever cared for me? How did you think I felt? I'm a doctor! In an emergency, I have to go!. Whenever I've asked you to come to a party with me, you always have to do something else. I did my best. I love you, Man. But I love my career too. I'm not that important to you 'cause I'm not your patient, right? Some things come into our lives, then pass away. But for some, it may always remain in their heart. It may be good for us to stop and think about it And look back to see whether we forgot anything over time.
