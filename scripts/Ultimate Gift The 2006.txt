Sir, I I am so sorry for your loss. Am I speakin' to a Theophilus Hamilton of Birmingham? Sir? Yes, sir. This is he. Name's Howard Stevens. You can call me Red. I need a lawyer for a few business ideas I have a few still in the dream stage. Though the skies may weep the Bible assures us that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. I wonder who the old man negotiated with for the rain. Well, it's a sure bet he's laughin' watchin' us get soaked. Yeah, well, now it's his turn. There's not a person here whose life, in some way has not been touched by Howard Red Stevens. Red often quoted Malcolm Muggeridge saying that, Every happening, great or small is a parable by which God speaks to us and the art of life is to get the message. May the message of Red Stevens continue in the hearts of those he leaves behind. -What are you doing? You're gonna get all wet. -Bill. Even though Dad moved his corporate offices from Texas many years ago for tax reasons he always said he wanted to be buried under Texas soil. Is that him? That's him. Mom. -You're late. -For what? Give me some of that! Settle down over there. Good morning. Before we start, I'd like to say how much Red meant to me personally. As you know, we started out as business partners and we ended up as friends. I am deeply grieved by his passing. Yes, well, that's very nice. Now, may we proceed? Red's will is in his own words still, every bit as legal and binding Blah, blah, blah. And, so, my eldest son, Bill I leave my company, Panhandle Oil and Gas. Currently worth $600 million. However, Bill, since you had zero interest in my company while I was alive I don't imagine that will change much after my death. Therefore, the board will maintain control. Excuse me, but my client would like to explore all of his options. Your client has no more options. One of those instructions Mr Hamilton skipped over is Red's desire that each of you vacate after receiving your portion of the estate. -As in, leave the room. -What the She can't talk to me like that. -Well, do something. -You can go now, Mr Stevens. -What All right. Fine. Fine. -We should really go. I have never been so humiliated. Did you see that old man talking' to me that way? And you guys just sat there and said absolutely nothin'. That's it? -A cow farm? -A 10,000-acre cow farm. Well, what's that worth anyway? Ruth, come on. Come here. What exactly do we get? A place for you to take your mistress. Come on, Ruth. Let me explain. -I want to see everything! Full disclosure. -Come on, Jack. Let's go. -Good day, Mr Stevens. -You said you had a strategy! -This is a long way from over. -You said it was a slam dunk! -To Sarah, widow of my late son, Jay Howard Stevens I am truly sorry for the events of the past. Please know that Jays death represents the greatest tragedy I have ever experienced. I leave you control of my Myers Park estate where you now reside and a managed trust for expenses as long as you live. -There we go. Since your choice of male companionship is vast and varied the deed and title for the house will remain under the control of my trustees. -Good day, Mr Hamilton. -Good day. It's amazing just how far the fruit can fall from the tree. And still roll a great distance. Nice of you to show up. You're in time for nothin'. Let's go. Jason. How do you know my name? It's my business to know everyone named in your grandfather's will. Let's cut the b.s., 'cause I know what he left me nothing. Walk away you'll never know, will you? Jason? So, what's in the box? Your inheritance. Have a seat. Does the box or the seal appear to have been tampered with in any way? No. Then therefore witness this day that I am breaking the seal affixed in my presence by Red himself. -Miss Hastings. -Yes, sir. -Are we on? -Yes, we are. Mmm. Well, then, If you're watching this I must be dead. That's a strange concept. How was my funeral? Well attended? I hope it rained. Hamilton, Miss Hastings I hope you're having a better day than I am. If you've just been with my family, I doubt it. Jason, I made a lot Of mistakes with our family but you're the one I think I hurt the most. The only way I can make it up to you is to not give you anything. I knew it. What I mean by that is that I'm not giving you anything just yet. So sit back down there. I've been thinking about this for a long time. How can I give you something and not have it ruin you like your uncles and aunts? Even some of their kids. So I want to give you a gift a series of gifts leading up to, well I wanna call it the ultimate gift. Now, you fail in anyway, it's over. You get nothing. And everything you do must be to Mr Hamilton's satisfaction. You might wanna make friends with him sooner than later. This is a voice-activated Conversay. It allows two-way communication between our office and you. And you can also replay Red's messages on it if you need to. -Sir. -Ah, good. There's a flight to Houston tomorrow at 7:00 a. m. As in morning, 7:00am? Yes. That 7:00 a. m. -For what? -You have until then to accept. -Why do I have to go? -You'll find out when you get there. -This is whacked. -You might wanna rethink that. What could he possibly give me that he hasn't already taken away? Huh? Screw him. Screw both of you. Well. How was your day? I'm not sure. What do you mean? My grandfather may have left me something. -Yeah? -I'm just trying to figure it out. -You mean it's not cash? -I don't know. Don't know? If l want to play into his little power trip, I gotta go pick it up. -Where? -Texas. -Yech. -You know what? I'm not going. Well, aren't you at least curious? What if it's gold? He ruined my life. My best revenge is to just ignore him. Besides, I've got a trust fund. Worst-case scenario I'll live off my mom. I don't need his money. Yeah, but one can always use some extra walking-around money. Not if I have to sell my soul. But, if you had to, at least try to get as much out of him as you can. My gosh. What if you actually had to get a job sometime? Police escort sorta. Uh, ladies and gentlemen from the flight deck, we have a very full flight to Houston this morning. Uh, excuse me, sir. Can I- Can I see your boarding pass again? Thank you. Yeah. See, this is, uh I'm sorry. This is for coach. Nah. That's impossible. -No. It's, uh, 32B. -Well, change it. We can't Please. We can't No. Thanks a lot. We can't change it. It's a Q fare. You can't upgrade. -So, can we -Do you have any idea who I am? I- I know exactly who you are. You're the guy in Seat 32B. Here we go. Conversay to Jason Stevens. Hello, Jason. What is this, one of those things Aunt Martha had to wear? I see you're at the, uh, Houston airport. Uh, Baggage Claim. You got a problem? You don't look like you've worked a day in your life. Great. The Amazing Kreskin. I'm don't know what I'm supposed to be doing, because no one's been Hey! Hey! I'm Gus. I'm your ride. Get in. I'm sorry about your grandfather's passin'. He and I go way back. He was some man. He loved to work. The man just loved hard work. Right. Mind if I smoke? Ah, it's a free country. Can you stop at the next convenience store? -Convenience store? -Please. The last store was about 50 miles back. We've been on my property for the last 30 minutes or so. Well, seein' as how you're Red's grandson you'll stay in the main house with us. I know it ain't much. The little lady just wanted a modest place. Dinner's in an hour. Breakfast at 5:00. Uh, Gus? -Aren't you forgetting something? -I don't think so. Shoot. The gift. So this is hell. Hey, city boy. Breakfast is over. Don't you have some kind of gizmo to wake you up? Beat it. -Good morning. -What is your problem! Time to get to work. The sun'll be up soon. Man Speaking Spanish ] -Let's go! Your granddad and I started out together wild cattin' oil wells down in Louisiana. Made some money. We each bought cattle spreads as a hedge against the oil runnin' out. Of course, he really made it. -Nice to own your own little piece of Texas, right? -Right. Just from there eight feet from the center. What? Lunch will be sent 'round about 11:00. Well, how far am I supposed to go? Don't worry. You'll run out of posts before you run out of Texas. I wish I had a dollar for every fence post I've ever set. Matter of fact, I do. Hey. What do you think? No! Hey! Aw! Come on, man! So, I'm dying to know. What did you get? Uh, it's complicated, but it involves land building materials and slave labor. They're giving you a shopping mall? Not exactly. So it must be the land, right? They're giving that to you? -Uh, land's got a lot to do with it, yeah. -You don't sound too sure. Well, whatever it is, I gotta survive this geriatric cowboy until he gives it to me or when I get back or or when I'm finished. Finish what? You know what? Let me get back to you, okay? Jason, what are you So that's it. Yeah. Let's go. I'm not done. Work's never done on a ranch. All right. Whatever. You know, you do any work like you just did you can do anything. Now, aren't you forgettin' something? -I don't think so. Shoot. -The gift. I came here to pick up a gift. Remember? That was the gift? I do manual labor for a month and you're trying to tell me it was a favor to me. -The gift of work. -Wow. -Congratulations. -Look, Hamilton. Just tell me what my total inheritance is. I'm over this. Where are you going? Where is he going? Can you tell him to come back, please? Mr Hamilton. Mr Hamilton. Hey. Mr Hamilton, sir. Please. I think it's only fair I know the amount of money we're dealing with here. Don't you? I've been gone for a month. Just tell me What do I have to do? What is it? Red said, a series of gifts. But let me add a personal note. I, too, think this is a waste of time. But it will end shortly, because you are going to fail. I expect you to fail and to fail miserably. Now, if you do want to continue make an appointment with Miss Hastings. Okay. Look. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mr Hamilton. I've been acting like a moron about this whole thing, and I'm sorry. And now I- I see exactly what you and Red have in store for me and I think it's exceedingly beneficial. So, what's the next gift? You'll know. Howdy. Wait! Wait! That's an $8,000 paint job! You don't begin to live until you've lost everything. Heck, I've lost everything three or four times. It's the perfect place to start. Now, for most of your adult life you have been the life of the party and an easy touch for a lot of weak hangers-on. Now let's see who your real friends are. I was at your funeral, and there wasn't a single person there who wasn't on your payroll or didn't have something to gain from your death. What exactly is he asking me to do? He wants you to come back at the end of the month with one true friend. Thank you. -And how were the lobster tails? -It was fine, thanks. The lady was enjoying the Montrachet. And sir, the Margaux. I hope it met your expectations. It was terrific. Thank you. We don't get too many requests for the '78. It's a bit too pricey for some of our patrons. I'll just leave this with you then. Caitlin, where do you see our relationship? -What are you asking me, Jason Stevens? -Just thinking. How long have we been going out? Uh, an appropriate amount of time. -Long enough. -See? My thoughts exactly. I was thinking that maybe it's time to take us more seriously. Yes? But there's something I want to ask you first. Jason, if you're talking about a prenup, isn't that sort of passe? Well, see, I'm in I was thinking Excuse me, sir. The charge card company declined the charge. That's impossible. I don't have a credit limit. Just run it through again. It's always our practice to run it through again but they declined. Okay. So, I was thinking, um well, maybe, it'd be a good time for me to move in with you. Uh, you move in with me? Why? Half my wardrobe's at your penthouse. Just for a change of scenery. Besides, I'm remodeling my place. A remodel? But Who's your designer? I know everyone in town. I should've said I'm beginning to remodel. I've only really started with the demolition. I'm sorry, sir. Your bank is on the line. They'd really like to speak with you. I must insist. Look, guys. I'm having a little bit of a setback. It's nothing that can't be fixed. All right? Sweetie, I'm switching accounts right now and I'm temporarily out of money. Is there a way you could pay for this? Jason, you're, um You're, uh asking me to pay the bill? It's You owe me. What? Yo, dude, I'm rollin' over. What do you mean I can't? I have been there for you countless times. You owe me. That's it. Bottom line. Who was the one who loaned you I could come up with a better excuse when I was 12 years old. All I need is a place to sleep. I don't get what the problem is. You can let me spend the night. One night. Hello? Sorry. Your service has been disconnected. -Can I help you? Yeah, shut up. -No. Nothing, thanks. Jason. Um Uh, what a surprise. -Mom, you're never gonna believe this. -I'm afraid I can't let you in. I'm having a bit of a situation. I need some help. -I need to borrow some money. -Of course you do. Everyone needs money. Uh Didn't your grandfather leave you anything? What are you talking about? He hated me. Jason, he did not. He didn't come around much, but, uh, I always thought it was because of me. It doesn't matter. Do you have any extra spending cash? I would love to help you. -But I can't. -You can't? They told me specifically that you would be comin' around for money and that I was not to give you anything. But I'm your son, Mom. That's what you're supposed to do. If l violate their instructions I am out everything everything. So for the sake of the greater good I must insist that you leave. I'm not gonna upset the whole applecart just because you're facing a few challenges. I'm sorry. I just cannot help you. Thanks. Ow! Hey, man. You're You're on my bench. You're on my bench. Beat it. -A simple no would have sufficed. -Fine. No. -No, what? -No, you cannot sit on this bench. This is not your bench. This is a city bench. -Go sit on another bench. -But it's my bench. I've got just as much right to it as anybody. It's a free country, you know. See, that's where you're wrong. Name one thing in this country that's for free. You need money for everything. Without money, you're nothing. Look at you. No money. No food. No family. No friends. Nothing. Besides, I'm sitting on this bench now. This is my bench. Okay? I'll flip you for it. Fine. I have a quarter. Thanks. Oh. Well, aren't you gonna chase him for it? Beat it, kid. I've been watching you. You're not a real bum. We saw you at a funeral. Quite the entrance. -What were you doing at -My mother and I come here for lunch every day. Except, right now, she doesn't know where I am. -Emily! -Whatever. Emily! Oh! Emily. -You must really be having a bad life. -Come on. Right now. I was just having a pleasant conversation with this gentleman. -Leave us alone, please. -Dear, don't be ridiculous. Sorry to disturb you. Come on. That's okay. I'm not the one who's disturbed. Some friend you are. Thanks a lot, poser. You know what I've said about talking to strangers. -He's not a real bum. -Hey. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, this is gonna sound really, really strange but I'm just gonna come out and say it. I'll make a deal with you. I need a friend. But only for a little while, and, uh in return, I don't know, I'll take you both to Disneyworld. Excuse me? -I need a friend. -Explain yourself. -It's complicated. -No, it's not. It's pathetic. -Come on. Now, just because -Mom, I told you. -He's not a real bum. -Okay. Oh, dude, come on. She doesn't even like Chateauneuf du Pape. Thank you. Miss Hastings, bring me the Stevens file. Looks like our boy's not even gonna make it through round two. But, sir doesn't he have until the end of today? Well, from what I hear he could have another month and still get the same result. Yes, sir. -So, what do you think? Is this a good spot? -Yeah, perfect. You can see everything under the perfect tree. -Hey! Hey! Give that back! -I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm just hungry. -Sir, you need to step back. -Don't you have a sandwich? -You need to step back. -Leave her alone. Get back! Get back! I've got 911 all dialed in. All I have to do is press Send. Sweetheart, get back. -Ow! No! -Hey! Hey! Leave 'em alone. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! Whoo! Yeah. My bench. Mwah! -So, you have a bet with a dead guy? -Mm-hmm. -Cool. -Emily. Be polite. Wait. How can you have a bet with a deceased person? See, that's the part that's complicated. So you come up with a friend. What do you get if we go along with this? -Emily. -No, it's okay. I don't know. Something about an ultimate gift or something. But you're not sure what that is. Yeah, that about sums it up. So what do we get if we agree to do this? -We need money. How much are you willing to pay? -Emily! I'm sorry. You're gonna have to excuse my daughter. Sometimes she tends to be a little outspoken. I can't promise you anything. Now, that's better. But what if we really did become friends? -Emily, it's not polite -Shh. -So you're Jason's friend? -Yes, I am. -True friend? -Absolutely. Pinky promise. So, how long have you known Mr Stevens? We go way back. We're like this. Now, where do I sign? And, uh he hasn't promised you any compensation for this friendship? Look at him. Does he look like he has anything to offer? So, uh you expect this friendship to continue? I plan on knowing Jason for the rest of my life. Tomorrow lunch at noon, our usual spot in the park. Sure. Just a minute, pal! You owe me. Emily. Wait. They go back a long way, don't they? There was a time when Mr Hamilton was quite ill and needed a kidney transplant. Your grandfather went out of his way to help him find a donor. You could even say, I think, that Mr Hamilton's alive today because of Red Stevens. Um. In the, um, basement of this building there's a small apartment for a custodian. It isn't being used right now. Perhaps you'd, um, like to take a look at it? Thank you. Jason, you have no concept whatsoever of the value of money. Money has always been available to you, like the air you breathe. I tell you, let's, uh, review some highlights of your recent past. A $25,000-per-night suite in Paris with a personal chef whom you tipped heavily. Toured the Bordeaux region in chauffeured hot-air balloons. That was amazing. A week of heli-skiing in Saint Moritz. A small fleet of exotic cars. The latest in everything, including women. But the past is the past and I figure you've probably had a pretty tough month. Well, it's about time. Thank you very much. And if l ever see you two again it'll be too soon. Well, seeing how you've never held one of those before let me explain what it is. That's a paycheck. That's for what you earned at Gus's ranch. Of course, the I. R. S. ravaged it first. I hate those guys. In your pocket every step of the way. You start out in business, and then you have to make a payroll. And just when you think you're gonna make a Mr Stevens, this is the Gift of Money, please. Yeah, all right. Sorry. Look at me. I'm carrying on about death and taxes even after I'm dead. Now, you have to take that money and? as much as you need it yourself spend it on someone experiencing a real problem. What can they teach you? Put yourself in their shoes. Jason, would you like us to cash it for you? Please. I think we know you well enough that we won't need any I. D. How will you know how I spent it? We'll know. Hey. I didn't take anything. Nothin'. Nothin'. Oh, no. Great. Naturally. A young blonde woman and her little girl. -Just down the hall. -Thanks. Paging Dr Howard. Dr Howard. Paging Dr Kline. Dr Kline. Paging Dr Howard. What are you doing here? -You saw her. -Yeah. Did you talk to her? -So, what's wrong with her? -That depends. -On what? -On who you really are. Maybe I can help you. Emily has leukemia. We thought she was in remission after her bone marrow transplant but a couple of weeks ago her body started to reject the transplant. I'm sorry. Uh, hey. Uh, well, you gotta need money, right? Oh, so that's it. You won your bet with your rich grandfather. You're back off the streets. Congratulations. What is it now? Uh, I do have to give away some money. You're getting less mysterious by the minute. I bet you're gonna get to the end of your game, collect your cash -and just ride off into the sunset. -I don't know. Maybe. But, Alexia, if l can help you, why won't you just let me? Because no rich kid is gonna use me or my daughter to play a game. She owes $1,600 in back rent. Pay it. You're a hundred dollars short. Your check was for 1,500. Tell Hamilton I'm good for it. Just pay that bill. Your other hundred. Well, push Play. Our lives should be lived not avoiding problems but welcoming them as challenges that will strengthen us so that we can be victorious in the future. So, now that I've given you the gift of work and friends and the value of money let's discover the gift of family. Now this is a tough one but see if it's even remotely possible to get something positive out of our family. See if they truly know how to count their blessings. I f my doctors are remotely accurate this assignment might even fall on Thanksgiving. How appropriate. He's joking, right? Dr Allen, you're wanted in O.B. Dr Allen, please report to Obstetrics. -Hey, where's the girl? -Who, Emily? She's with God. Oh, there's my best friend. Listen, about the other day So, now you know all about me. No more mysteries. -Look, I'm really sorry. -Shut up. Don't be pathetic. I wonder if he takes advance orders. For what? For my place. You know, up there. What do you think it's gonna be like? Butterflies. Lots of butterflies. Did you know, God paints every color on a butterfly with his fingers. I didn't know you thought about stuff like that. I think about dying. There's something basically unfair about a person dying. I even hate the idea. You know, I, uh I don't know much about God or or Jesus. But I can promise you that those arms are meant for you. What's gonna happen to my mom? I really don't hate her, you know. Did I mention I wouldn't be upset if you kissed her? Do you think your mom and I Okay. It's official. You are the slowest person I have ever met. You two were made for each other. I knew that back in the park. -In the park, I looked like a bum. -Let's not be delusional. You were a bum. So, what are you doing for Thanksgiving? -Mrs Drummond? -Yes. I want to send Emily's charts and blood work off to a specialist see whether or not she's a candidate for another transplant. Oh. Uh, will that give her a better chance than chemo? Unfortunately, chemotherapy isn't going to be enough. I'm sorry. Thank you. So when I found out I was pregnant he was getting ready to leave for college and, uh didn't want anything to get in his way. And Emily she's she's the best decision I ever made. So, apparently someone came by and covered my back rent. Was it you? Thank you. I have a question for you, and I hope I'm not being out of line here. I was wondering if you'd like to join me for Thanksgiving. Oh. Um, thanks. That's nice of you to ask, but I can't. Um, obviously, Emily needs me here, so But thanks. Well, it's too bad, because youre missing out on a splendid example of a way-too-wealthy American dysfunctional thing. -It's Yeah. -Oh. You know, I have the strangest feeling I might have enjoyed it. What are you thinking about? Nothin'. You're thinking about Jason. Yeah. He's weird, isn't he? He's a good weird. You know, he, uh, invited me over to Thanksgiving with his family. -Oh, really? -Yeah. Of course, I told him, Whatever, loser. -I think you should go. -Absolutely not. I wouldn't dream of missing Thanksgiving with you. So why'd you decide to come? -My daughter banished me. -Oh. So I have you by decree. Mmm, knowing Emily by design. Mission accomplished. Two completely opposite people who wouldn't have had a chance without me destined to make each other miserable. You okay, Jason? Oh. Don't tell me you've never been on a bus before. Wow. Brace yourself. Jason, seriously. -I'm willing to bet that they are perfectly normal people. -Oh, yeah? How much? This is nice. Thank you. You know, I had my firm do an informal audit just the financials of the publicly held side. And there's still several hundred million floatin' around. Well, you knew him better than I. Most of those companies were privately held. Maybe we should check into some of his favorite charities. -They do have to report large contributions. -That's a great idea. Daddy always was a sucker for a begging hand. Hmm. Unfortunately, you're right. And what sort of business does your family come from, Alexia? Um, health care. Oh, how wonderful. Well, we have a wing in the hospital downtown. A couple of wings, I think. Or is it a couple of hospitals? I always forget. My daughter is receiving great care thanks to your father. Great sector-health care. Little flat in the third quarter, but poised to rocket. Okay. I'd like to propose a toast. Yes. To each other. For suffering through a year of great adjustment. Uh, excuse me. Does anyone else seem to notice it smells a little like cowhide in here? And how are those sin stocks of yours doing, Jack? What's wrong with a little investment in alcohol, tobacco and firearms? -Over the stench of oil? -And what's wrong with oil, Thank you very much? My money's just as green in Manhattan as anywhere else. So, who does get the rest of the estate? Sarah? Well, I don't know anything about that. Well, you were the last one in there. -No, I wasn't. -Well, that's just ridiculous, darling. When we left, you were the only one there. Well, Jason was also there. -Ah. Jason. -Do enlighten us, Jason. You certainly could not have been the one that received the bulk of Red's estate. -Or are you? -Is that why you insisted we get together for Thanksgiving so you could reveal your newly enhanced trust fund to us? It's Thanksgiving. I was hoping maybe we could all go around the table and each say something that we're most thankful for. -Are you on crack, Jason? -Again? Well, here's a thanks. We don't have to put up with Dad's endless litany of cliched quotes this season. Or hand-spun, cornpone wisdom. Hear! Hear! Who is that? I think he works down at the video store. Well, Jason will tell you all you need to know about this man this dearly departed. I mean, he more than anyone here has a bone to pick with the late, great Red Stevens. Jason, I can only imagine what you've just been through. -I could never get them to be thankful for anything either. -What have you got? -Hey! -What in the world is that? -All right, give it back. -Pass it to me. Come on. -Give it back! - and if you do succeed -Here Take it! -you'll be one step closer to all I have for you. What's all I have for you? It's between him and me. It's none of your business. It has everything to do with us. It's our money! So he's making you work for your inheritance? Not anymore, 'cause I don't think I could ever win at this one. Alexia, let's go. -Jason. Wait. Wait! -Don't! Just tell them what they want to hear. I don't have to tell them anything. Jason, you're gonna hear from my attorney Monday morning. -Yeah. Ditto. -Shut up, Jack. You're all pathetic. Wait. Jason, slow down. I put up with that for years. I was a part of that. What happened to your dad? He's dead. What else do you want to know? How'd he die? The only person who really knows just took it to his grave. Jason, there's something I always want you to remember, okay? When I met you, you were a homeless person. And you made friends with my daughter. We shared peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. All this without me knowing anything about your background. Yeah, well, the problem is, that's me back there. Yeah, but you can walk away from all that. You already have. I appreciate what you're saying, but money changes things. It gets you stuff. It's a- It's a way to live life worry free. -Money takes away the worry. -Yeah, I saw what money can do. And your worries or whatever you want to call them they're not life or death, Jason. Okay, I'm sorry, but my getting my inheritance is a matter of life or death. And I know when I say that, I sound like I'm being a Stevens and being a Stevens is all about money. But it's not. It's more. So, I'll pay you back as soon as possible. What? Uh, the money I owe you the 1,600. Happy Thanksgiving. Marietta Ruby. From the time I met her in the seventh grade that was my sweetheart. She didn't make it easy though. Took me all the way till the eighth grade to catch up with her. She's beautiful. Yeah. She passed away shortly after we were married. I'm really sorry. The greatest gift she gave me was the will to move on to overcome. You know, I may have met someone myself. Then cherish her. And become the man she deserves. Have a seat. Now, as I said I had a feeling you were gonna stop by. That university you attended What was it rated? Number three? Number-three party school in the country. Do- Do you truly knowhow to learn? Jason, any process worth going through will get tougher before it gets easier. That's what makes learning a gift even if pain is your teacher. No. There's no way. Anywhere but there. I know what he's trying to do, and it's not gonna work. He can take his millions to his grave. I don't care. What he's trying to do is for your benefit, not your destruction. You know, Hamilton, you sound just like him. But guess what. You're not him. I don't know, son. I do have one of his kidneys. He's been out there for hours. Yep. He's got some big decisions to make. Do you think he'll come in or go home? He doesn't have a home. You're right! She hates you! -I know. -Then why are you here? I have to leave the country for a while. I'm reluctant to go because of what I'm leaving behind. What are you leaving behind? Then you have to go. Now get out of here. You screwed up big time, you know! I had to eat a rubber hospital turkey for Thanksgiving! You better be back by Christmas! Even down here, you put your name on everything. Welcome! Oh, welcome! Jason Stevens. Oh! Oh! So good to meet you. -I'm Bella. -Hi. May I be the first to show you inside the library your grandfather built? -Yeah, sure. -Oh, good, good. Where are all the books? Oh. You joke. W- With the people. Is it not like that in the great libraries de Los Estados Unidos? Villagers wait for books. You bring them new books. They are waiting for you to pick up old books. Exchange. Library. Si? So basically, I'm in a third world country at a backwards library with no books. And the books that are here, I can't even read. Great. Mmm. This I found when I was cleaning his desk once I heard of Red's passing. I thought maybe you would like to keep. When you sent this to him he proudly showed it to all of us. Then the tragedy. It broke his heart. Dear Grandpa How's Ecuador? I miss you and Dad so much. You know, my birthday's coming up, and I was thinking instead of giving me gifts this year could you take me on one of your trips? I promise I won't cause any trouble. I just want to see you and Dad again soon. Write back, please. Love, Jason. Hola. Un momento, por favor. You look just like your father. I was here the night he died. It happened up on that mountain, didn't it? -Take me there. -You cannot go. It is now the province of the drug lords. You don't understand. I'll pay you. Well, someday. I understand perfectly. But, senor, I only have one life. You're just bargaining now, aren't you? Senor Stevens, you do not want to pay the price it would take. No one who goes there returns. Our guest of honor, Mr Jason Stevens! Oh. Gracias. I'm afraid to ask. Oh, you will love it. It's so rare we catch one. -The chief is going to talk. -Oh. He says we are here to celebrate you and those who keep the Jay Stevens Library alive. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. No. No, no, no. He must be mistaken. My grandfather was very generous. Everything's named after him. No, it is the Jay Stevens Memorial Library. To my father. -Salud. -Salud. Have some more. -Salud. -Salud. Salud! Salud. You cannot hope to find it without me. How'd you know I'd go? You are a Stevens, are you not? I thought you said you couldn't take me. My purpose in coming to you was a promise I made to Senor Red that you could learn the truth. He had one desire and one desire alone to ask your forgiveness. He said one day you would come. Only then you could learn the truth. Stop! Stop the jeep. He had learned of a village in the next valley that had a plague and needed medical supplies. But he never understood why Red forbid him to go. There was no plague. There was no village. What? Red wanted to introduce your father to the oil business. But your father was restless and bored. -No. No. -He snuck away. He ran away -and took a plane he had no business taking. -No. This is what Red wanted to protect you from. Till now. There can be no blame for what happened here. The penalty for your father's impulsiveness unfortunately, was a life his. Americano? Ow. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness. Can't you find him? We think that he went searching for the crash site which is in lawless territory. -I'm sorry. Crash site? -Where his father died. Well, I mean, is is he in any danger? I'm so sorry. Neither love, nor hate thy life; but what thou livest, live well however long or short may the heavens permit. Tell me about my father. In many ways, he was very similar to you restless, rebellious, angry. I think Red saw something in him that he didn't see in his other sons a fire. The same fire he sees in you. I still don't forgive you. Amigo? Amigo, are you here? No, no, no! No! No, no! Please, no! I can- I can pay you! I have money! Please! -Oh, God! God! Does anyone understand what I'm saying? Mueren. Mueren. Muerte. Death. Hey. Hey. Hey. Shh. Can you walk? Save yourself. Not on your life. Come on. Come on. Hey. Oh. Mmm. What are you doing here? I was scared to death. Where's Emily? Um, she's resting. She'll see you tomorrow. You guys have a good Christmas? We didn't have one. How could we? You know what? We're gonna have a fantastic one next year. I promise. We won't have a next year. The events of that day playin my mind over and over and over again. I'm so sorry. If your father hadn't died while working for me Please give me a chance to explain. Ever since that day, my life has been filled with grief. It is apparent that you will never forgive me. I do not blame you for this. It's also something that I cannot do for myself. I loved your father so much. A parent should never have a child precede them in death. It is the most painful experience imaginable. Uh that's enough for today, gentlemen. Welcome back, stranger. Hey. Ta-da. Here Wow. An airport gift shop gift. How thoughtful. Does it come with needles? Uh Yeah, you can kiss me, even though you're a guy. I missed you too. Whatever. Let's cut to the chase. You really blew it with us this Christmas. I was unavoidably detained. Okay, yeah. I want Christmas. I want to ride a horse. Oh, I got, like, a week or two left with this other thing but, um, let me make a call and we'll see Jason. Now. Okay. -That works for me. -Excuse me, sir. It's Jason on line two. Oh, uh, will you all excuse me? I have to take this call. Go ahead, Jason. Mr Hamilton, look. One way or another, this is over. Either I was in South America way too long or I missed the deadline or whatever but what I'm about to do is way more important. And I know you have no reason whatsoever to trust me but I need to borrow my grandfather's jet. And I need it now. I want to take Alexia and Emily to Gus's ranch for a late Christmas. Jason, do you know what you're doing? Look, I have no control Uh, what, um, Mr Hamilton was saying was that, uh he'll be sending along Red's next gift on your Conversay. You have your bags packed within the hour and, uh, he will have the jet fueled -and ready to go. -Thank you. This means so much to me. And, Hamilton I promise I'm gonna take back all those nasty thoughts about you being the Grinch. Thanks again. Merry Christmas. Hey, Gus! What is this? Snow in Texas? Had it trucked in. Ho, ho, ho! All right, Hector, hit it! -Merry Christmas. -Gus, this is Emily. -Hi, Emily. Welcome. -Alexia. -Hi. -Alexia, how ya doin'? -And there he is. -Hey. I'll get your bags. I see why you chose this place. I wish I could take the credit. Emily said her wish was to go horseback riding with you. What? Emily What? What's wrong? She's She's terrified of horses. I'm the one who loves horses. Oh, Jason, it's so beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. Well, this is what I was tellin' you about. -Pretty, huh? -It's beautiful. Hey, come here. I wanna show you something. Gonna be okay, sweetie? Alexia -there's something I need to do. -What? For Emily. And now for me. And Gus. How about that? When I achieved my dreams, it was like going home to a place I'd never been before. You don't know that feeling, do you? The first few gifts I've given you have been practical. Show up, do this, do that. And then the gifts started needing you to provide input. They needed intuition. Still, your average person is too weighted down. Jason, you need to be free, free to dream. You need to come up with a dream, then act on it. Jason, this is the time for you to dream. You thinkin' about butterflies? No, Jason, I'm looking at the stars. You know, I set this whole thing up because I thought you wanted to go horseback riding not your mom. Get real. Horses are smelly and sweaty. So, sweetie, what's your dream? If you could dream of anything anything what would your dream be? My dream? My dream was a perfect day. And I'm just finishing it. My dream was to be with people I love who love each other, that love me. What about you, Jason? What's your dream? I don't know. For as long as I can remember, all I wanted to do was have fun. Now I don't have a clue. It's okay. Guys are clueless. Hey, you have to know this. Even if you don't have a dream of your own you gave me mine. -That counts for something. -Mmm. Of course. Look at her. Isn't she beautiful? I mean, except for her choice in lipstick. But you have to admit even if you got nothing else out of the deal but her you'd still be a huge winner. Don't blow it. Knowing you, you're likely to do it. Merry Christmas, Jason. Merry Christmas. Up until now, I have only existed. I've, um I've drifted through life day to day thinking that that was enough. And honestly, I don't know if I have my own dream. But I do know I can help others fulfill theirs. I know it. Jason, will you excuse us for a few minutes? Hamilton & Partners. We've deliberated and evaluated whether or not your answer conforms with the expressed desires of Red Stevens and we find that your answer does. Therefore, we are releasing an amount allocated for you at this time. That is, uh $100 million to do with whatever you please. All of us here at the firm want to congratulate you, Jason for sticking it out putting up with some very harsh conditions and prevailing. Congratulations, Jason. So that's it? Yes, I- I think so. No, don't get me wrong. It's not the amount. It's, uh It's just I don't know. I was expecting a different feeling or something. I think that's because now you are a diffferent person. And, uh And, no we won't cash that check for you. Okay, so he is the best architect in town. That's great. Tell him I want a meeting with him first thing Monday morning. - -And how much is that? I want to tour that property as soon as possible. Oh, that's amazing. We'll have a meeting at the bank in, let's say, what, a month? -That would depend on how many vehicles you were talking. -I'm sorry. Can you hold on? -Certainly. -Yeah? Mr Stevens, a- a young lady to see you. -Great. Send her up. -Okay. -I'm sorry. -Will it be a large number of Yeah, there are gonna be plenty of cars. -Okay, we'll have to look into it and let you know. -Okay, Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, I like the remodel. Where have you been? In and out of prison. Mmm. Good to hear. No visible tattoos. -I missed you. -Hmm. -What's this? -Oh, it's nothing. That's a nice round number. Somehow I don't think you'll be having any more credit card problems, will you? You know, um, you still owe me a dinner. How could I ever forget? I missed you. I think I still remember my way around. Why don't you meet me in a few minutes? How quaint. Hmm. Jason? Where'd you go? Shall I keep the limo running, Mr Stevens? Maybe not. Ah, Mr Hamilton, Miss Hastings, I'm so happy you came. Jason, what's going on? Have a seat. Please. I insist. Thank you all for joining me today. May I direct your attention to It's called Emily's Home. It's for a dozen or more families experiencing extraordinary health challenges. Now, over here will be the homes. They're part of the same complex, yet individual dwellings. Families are gonna be able to live together while they face their problems. Now, obviously, there's gonna be plenty of parking. Over here is gonna be a state-of-the-art employment center catering to parents, single or married, who need to earn some sort of income while their child undergoes treatment. Now, at this state-of-the-art hospital Excuse me. What's missing? Oh, yeah. A church a worship center. How much is this gonna cost? If you look at the prospectus in front of you, page 5. The total initial outlay will be $350 million. Your part will be to underwrite the financing and a loan guarantee of 250 million. I'm gonna be putting up the first Mr Stevens, this is all well and fine. We did business with your grandfather for many years. Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting, but I didn't phrase this as a question. You are gonna do this. You made this much off my grandfather in a typical year. And, gentlemen, this project has the full resources of the Hamilton law firm backing it. -Yes? Oh, I Pro bono, as I'm sure you will be too. Wrap up the details for me, will you, Hamilton? -My pleasure. -Thank you all. I appreciate it. Hey! Whoa! Come on, come on, come on, come on! She wanted me to be there. It was so important to her. She wanted me to be there. Jason, Alexia, as mayor of Charlotte it is my extreme honor and privilege to preside over the ground breaking for Emily's Home. But it is also a sad day in that the namesake and the inspiration for this incredible project is not here with us today. But her spirit will always be with us all. Jason, Alexia. Thank you very much. Thanks. I am so proud of the man you've become. Thanks in great part to you. Meet me at my office as soon as possible, will you? -I have one more matter I need to discuss. -Of course. We understand you went outside the boundaries of our instructions with one of those gifts. What? Don't what me. You know what I'm talking about. -Miss Hastings, will you, uh, dismiss everyone, please? -Oh. Yes, sir. Over the course of several days this investigator personally witnessed and recorded the subject as he committed various misdemeanor infractions for which he was never cited. Nevertheless, illegal activities did occur. Panhandling, bordering on assault stealing private property, resale of stolen items street vending without a permit jaywalking. It is the opinion of this investigator that the subject is a reprobate and not capable of completing the 12 gifts laid out in Red Stevens's will. That's enough, Miss Hastings. My pleasure, Mr Hamilton. Jason, if you made it this far, he had one final message. -Jason. -Yeah? You gave away the $100 million? All of it? -Yeah, so what? -Well, if you're standing here now it means that not only have you succeeded in receiving all of my gifts but have done so beyond the boundaries that I have set. I guess that means that I have succeeded as well. What I could not accomplish in life I have done in death. As long as you are still alive, I will be too. I love you, Son. I love you too. Good-bye, Jason. As executor of the estate of Red Stevens I hereby execute and otherwise assign complete and controlling interest to Jason Stevens the balance of Red's estate including all holdings, investment portfolio and offshore interests totaling in excess of two billion dollars. Depending on OPEC prices and foreign currency fluctuations, of course. I need a lawyer for a few business ideas I have a few still in the dream stage. When would you like to meet? Meet? Hell, you're hired. Sir, are you sure you wouldn't like to meet first? You were at the top of your law class, were you not? -Yes, sir. -Then you're my lawyer. Now let's get on with it. We got a world to conquer. Do you think I'm old, Miss Hastings? Mm-mmm. Well, I think it's about time I retire from this law firm. Whatever will you do, Mr Hamilton? Go to work with Jason Stevens. -Change the world. -Mmm. Hi. Thank you. So I want to give you a gift a series of gifts leading up to, well I wanna call it the ultimate gift. Now, you fail in anyway, it's over. You get nothing. You know, you do any work like you just did you can do anything. Now, aren't you forgettin' something? -I don't think so. Shoot. -The gift. The gift of work. -Wow. -Congratulations. The charge card company declined the charge. That's impossible. I don't have a credit limit. Just run it through again. It's always our practice to run it through again, but they declined. I need a friend. You expect this friendship to continue? I plan on knowing Jason for the rest of my life. Do- Do you truly know how to learn? Villagers wait for books. You bring them new books. They are waiting for you to pick up old books. Exchange. Library. Si? Well, you don't begin to live until you've lost everything. Wait! Wait! That's an $8,000 paint job! Heck, I've lost everything three or four times. It's the perfect place to start. And Emily she's -she's the best decision I ever made. - What's gonna happen to my mom? I really don't hate her, you know. -Salud. -Salud. Salud! Salud. Jason, you need to be free, free to dream. You need to come up with a dream, then act on it. And honestly, I don't know if I have my own dream. But I do know I can help others fulfill theirs. Uh, I do have to give away some money. You're getting less mysterious by the minute. She owes $1,600 in back rent. Pay it. You're a hundred dollars short. So, apparently someone came by and covered my back rent. Was it you? Thank you. What would your dream be? My dream? My dream was a perfect day. And I'm just finishing it. -I love you, Son. -I love you too. Good-bye, Jason.
