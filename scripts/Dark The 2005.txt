Is that the road we're on, mum? There won't be any signal out here. We're not lost. Shit. We should have stayed at a hotel in Cardiff. We wanted to surprise your dad, didn't we? Don't you wanna surprise your dad? Shoot. We're not lost! Sweetheart. Sarah. Hey. Sarah, time to go. Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Sarah! Sarah? - What is it? - Get out! What is it? Mum? Mum, stop it! It's just sheep. Just some stupid sheep. I have a brilliant idea. Why don't we go down and see if we can find your dad's house. What do you think? Are you gonna tell him? Do you want me to? No. Okay. Where the hell are we? Wow. Oh, this is so your father. Daddy! Daddy. Sarah. Hey... what a surprise. I wasn't expecting to see you till tomorrow. You're not upset we're early? I'm not upset at all. I'm happy. Okay. Hey, why the tears, huh? I'm just happy to see you. I'm happy to see you too. Good. Top of the morning to you, James. Hi. Hi. Hi. How are you? Wow, wow, wow, look at this house. For you. Oh, thank you very much. Hmm. Sarah wanted to get here, so... We actually arrived last night, but our car got stuck in the mud down yonder. I tried to call but there's no signal. ...no signal. So we had a little sleep over in the car. Didn't we, baby? And we had a close encounter with some sheep. Sure moved far enough. Well, far off is the way us weirdos like it. Dafydd. Would you mind giving us a hand with Adelle's car later? No, not at all. Thanks. This is Dafydd. He can fix anything. Hello. 'Dafydd', is that like 'David'? Exactly like David. Daf, Dai... Dave. - Hey, Dave. - Missus. Watch these. Jeez, you're getting big, aren't ya? How old are ya? Eighteen, nineteen? Quite a nice little hideaway you've built for yourself. Yeah, it's coming along. Yeah. Well... Oh, I love this. Look at you painting and sculpting like crazy. There's an abattoir on the property. Which I've turned into my studio. Really? What's an abattoir? A place where they kill animals. Nice. By the way, your rooms are upstairs. Can I go see? Yeah, sure. First door on your left. Okay. So... So... What's wrong with Sarah? Nothing. Just a bit of a loner. Like father like daughter, I guess. She's fine. We're fine. We just missed you. I... ...I missed you. Yeah, this is your room. That's great. Why, you've been working a lot. Look at this. Yeah. I know. Er... ...it's a bit of a mess. I'll tell you what, I'll find somewhere to put the rest of this stuff. No, no, it's fine. It's fine. Sarah, where are you? I'm up here. Oh, making a mess already? Wow, look at this place. What do they open? I've no idea. We've found them all over the place, but they don't seem to fit any of the locks. This is a funky little room. Yeah, it's a storage room or something. What are we gonna store up here? You, if you're bad. And we'll only let you out when you think about what you did, young lady. You like your room? - It's got a telescope. - Yeah. You can watch out for ships in distress. SOS. Save our souls. Elvis... Here, boy. Elvis! Sarah. Sarah, don't get too close to the edge. Hey. What'd you find there? A secret. A secret? Looks like someone made off with the plaque. Now why would they do that? Ann... Annwyn. Not Annwyn... Annwyn. It's Welsh. For what? For the place you go after you die. Like heaven? That's right. Sarah. Time to go. I'll go with you, baby. She's fine. Be careful. Elvis. What's it commemorate, anyway? Stumblehead, isn't it? Stumblehead? There were some people lived up here about fifty years ago. Kept themselves to themselves. Made up their own religion... Elvis. ...based on old Welsh legends. Do unto others sin, salvation... ...same as most faiths. So why put up a monument? Well... they had themselves a kind of minister... ...who preached them sick up here. Oh. Till one day, the lot of them suddenly up and... ...walked off that cliff... looking for a way to end their earthly suffering. Jesus, what a way to die. They didn't think they were dying. They thought they were going to Annwyn. You wouldn't wanna change your mind half way down! Sarah! Are you okay? I've got you, sweetheart. Are you all right? I dunno, they just came right at me. Oh my God, Sarah, are you all right? I'm fine. Oh my God, look at you. Baby, are you...? It's fine, it's just a scratch. I said I was fine! She's fine, Adelle. Hello. Hello? Hello. Where have you been? Your mummy's been a bad girl. You've been out all night. I'm going to live with dad. Sarah, we've been through this before, please. I talked to him and he said that he... I know he said but... He said I could stay as long as I wanted. Yes. When you're done with school you can go visit with your father in England. Wales! I'm going to live with dad. Sarah. I know this is all about you now. It's none of your god-damn business. It's all about you. You don't love anybody but your fucking self. Sorry. Didn't mean to scare ya. It's okay. What are you writing about? Ooh, I see. Secret, is it? Girl's stuff? Everything all right with ya? You seem a little... I don't know. You wanna talk about anything? No. You sure? No. Be nice to your mother. She does her best, you know. I've missed you. I missed you too. See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight. It's all about you. You don't love anybody but your fucking self! Stop it! Oh God. See. I hate you. I hate you! Sarah. I can't stand this any more! Sarah. Elvis! Shut your noise. It's just the bloody sheep! P, A, I... paint. You didn't let me do the N or the T. Give me another. Okay. R, O... rock. Dad you did it again! Okay, I'll let you finish it this time. Honest. L, O... ...SE? Lose? No. R... Loser? Are you calling me a loser? Eh? Well, if the shoe fits... Can we go exploring? Sarah? Do you wanna go for a walk? Hey. Listen, I'll, er I'll show you two a shortcut down to the beach. Yeah? Here, put this on, baby. Why? Er, because it's cold and you're gonna need it. It gets a bit chilly down there. Fine. Hey, Dave. Whoa, you don't wanna come closer. Dirty work. These are from yesterday. They fell from up there. They didn't fall they jumped. What do you mean they jumped? They jumped. I've seen sheep behave in many an odd way. But I've never seen them do something like this in a while. Maybe they just got plain fed up, huh? Couldn't take it any more. What are you gonna do with them? Funeral pyre. I'll give you a hand, Dafydd. I'll catch up with you, yeah? I'm so happy we're here, baby. Look at this place. What d'you find there? What is it? Hey, be careful on those rocks, all right? Sarah. Sarah. Sarah? Baby? Sarah, let's get back to your dad's. Come on, chop-chop. Sarah? Come on, let's go. Where are you? Sarah? Let's go. Sa... Sarah? Sarah, come out now, it's not funny. Sarah? Sarah! James! James! James, help us! Jay. James! Adelle! Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Jay! - Help! - Adelle! Help! - Jay! - Adelle! Er, Jay, Jay, Jay... Sarah! Sarah. Adelle! Where's Sarah? Where's Sarah? She fell in the water. In the water. - Oh God, she fell in... - What? Sarah? Sarah? Oh my God. Sarah. I let her go. Sarah? No, no, let me go. No. Let me go. No. He'll find her! No. Sarah! I lost... We'll begin again first light tomorrow morning. But I must say it... you should prepare yourself. My daughter could be alive out there, waiting for us to find her. The boats have lights, your men have lights. Then we search all fucking night if we have to. I can't stay here, Adelle. I'm going down to join the search. Adelle. We'll find her. Promise. I hate you. Sarah. I can't stand this any more! Dad's gone And on the count of three, I want you to open this door. Don't test me on this. Sarah? Mum Mum, help me... One... James. Jay! Sarah. Oh my God. Sarah. Sarah! Sarah! Are you in here? Mother. Sarah? Oh God. Sarah. Sarah? Is that who you're looking for? You won't find her here. This is where the sheep come to die. The sheep? But before they go... they must have the filth taken from them. And that's what he does for them... with scrapes and hooks... he cleans hell from their heads. He? Who is he? The Shepherd... All that you see is of his making. It's all right. It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? I told you, you won't find her here. Wait. Just wait. I want you to get me in there, see? Can you get me in there close to that shelf? Not till the tide's back in. How long? Another hour. I saw a girl. You saw a girl? Yes, out in the yard. What? I followed her out to the abattoir. You went to the abattoir? Yes. She said something... she said something about the Shepherd and she said something else, something in Welsh... I couldn't understand her. Adelle. I couldn't understand her and I... Adelle... you saw Sarah? well, and when I went to touch her, she just... Look, please Adelle... you saw Sarah? No. You've cut your hand. Why don't you let me have a look at it. I don't know why I thought it was her, but it wasn't. It wasn't her. It's okay. Come here. Before we left New York, Sarah and I had a fight. I was a bad mother. You weren't. You aren't. You did your best, we both did, and we made mistakes. She loves you, Adelle. We both do. Bed your pardon, missus. I just came to pick up James. Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm all right. I was just, er... I was just, er... I thought I heard something upstairs tapping, and, er... Sarah and James play this SOS game, they used to play this game. That's what waiting here is like, it's... How are you holding up? I don't know how this could have happened. I should have been there with them. Why don't you go back and stay with her? I'll let you know if we find anything. I wasn't there when she was lost. I want to be there when she's found. Who are you? ANNWYN Jesus. May 16th, 1952, put down six sheep. Panicked. Here, look at this. Where is it? Okay, okay, May 17th... ...Put down seven sheep. Burnt bodies to contain illness. Cause unknown. There's pages of it. Sheep dying for unknown reasons. Er, er, sick shit. Sheep, er, dissection and trepanning and then... ...and then over here it says, er... ...it says 'she is doing it'. She is killing the sheep.' Who is she? Who is she? I don't know who she is, Adelle. I don't know. Okay look at this. Right, it's her. The girl you saw in the abattoir? Yes. The same girl I saw the night Sarah went missing. Adelle, we didn't find her. Okay. We didn't find her today. Are you listening to me?! Yes, yes, I'm listening! Maybe we're just not looking in the right places, all right? This is crazy. Can you hear yourself? Can ya? I'm down there, Adelle. All those people are down there looking for our dead daughter. And you're running around the moors drawing pictures! Jesus. I'm sorry... Adelle. Welsh Farmers Mourn their Loss Inexplicable Disease Strikes Welsh Sheep Found what you're looking for? Er, yes, I'm fine, thank you. Er, actually, do you speak Welsh? Only to bother the English. Would you mind looking at this for me? Here. Derbynwy y plant afradlon yn ol l Gesail Annwyn. Well, plain enough, it means... 'The children were received back into the armpit of Annwyn'. The armpit of Annwyn... But probably, more like, um... 'The children were taken into the embrace of Annwyn'. Taken? Welsh mythology is full of that sort of thing. The living and the dead crossing back and forth, you know. Like what? You found it there. Creiddylad. She was pulled into Annwyn by a dark spirit. Her husband had to cross over to get her back. The maiden Creiddylad falling to the depths of Annwyn The Shepherd. The Shepherd and his flock.

She's here. Who's here? Ebrill. The Shepherd's daughter. She's upstairs in Sarah's bed. Adelle, please. She knows where Sarah is. She knows, she knows. You've gotta believe me, James. Look... Sarah drowned. Sarah is dead. She's not. She's not! I feel it. I know it, James. Jesus, Adelle. It's over. It's done! We've called it off. Do you get that? I've called off the search! Hush. Sshh, don't cry. Don't cry... mummy's here. Ebrill? Do you remember me from the abattoir? You know where Sarah is, don't you? James, look at her, she knows this place, she knows it. Is this the Shepherd's house? Yes, this was the Shepherd's house, wasn't it? A long time ago. And he lived here... ...all by himself. No, no, no. He lived here with you... Ebrill. Don't you remember? And he was very sick. That's the room. Show us. Tell us about the room. That's the room where the Shepherd kept his little lamb. And never let her out, no matter how she cried. No, don't hurt me. Please, don't hurt me! He'd take her out... to the place... ...where the sheep go to die. The abattoir? Your father cut your head, like he did the sheep, didn't he? And she begged and begged him to stop hurting her head. It's okay. But the dark had to come out of it somehow. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (WELSH) Don't you want your lockbox back? No, no, no, no, no, no... What's in the box, honey? Please don't make me go up there please. What's in the box? Tell me what's in the box! No! Adelle! Listen to me. She knows where Sarah is! Just stop it, Adelle! Just leave it for a minute, okay? Let me talk to her. Come on. I can't help ya unless you tell me where you came from. Do you know where your parents live? Eh? Do you know who you are? Where you came from? Why is she so angry at me? She's not angry at you. She's just very sad that our... that our daughter is gone. Did you love her? Yeah. Very much. Do you think that she knew that you loved her? I... I think so, yes. I hope so. I think she did. Look at you. You're filthy. Let's get you cleaned up and find someone who knows who you are. These should fit ya. Okay, when you're done, you come and talk to me, okay? Don't worry... everything's gonna be all right. Adelle! Adelle. What are you doing? What's that? It's Sarah's sweater. It can't be. No, it is. Look at it. Oh, James, it's a message. From who? From our daughter. She's telling us how to find her. I know where she is. What? Where? Where is she? She's gone... to a much better place. You know what this is, don't you? Do you know what this is? This is Sarah's sweater! Tell me where she is! Adelle please. You know where she is don't you?! - No! - Oh God. Oh God. Jesus. Oh, Jesus Christ, Adelle... This is insane. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That girl's head's been cut open more times than I can account for. Cut open? Yes, she was bleeding from what appeared to be an unhealed trepanning wound. That's right, you heard me. Trepanning. Primitive medicine. Tapping or cutting through the bone of the skull to cure diseases and mental illness. Who would do such a thing to a child? I was hoping that you might explain that to me. S... O... S. Mummy. Mummy. I'm here. Mum. Fucker! My daughter is alive. Creiddylad. The sweet young girl, taken beneath the waves... ...and held prisoner in the land of the dead. Ebrill has been dead for fifty years... ...and now she's here living and breathing. Explain that to me! You should leave it. Leave it? Imagine what a parent will do for their child. Look at me! Imagine what I'm willing to do! That's what I've been afraid of. She was a sickly girl from birth. And when she died... ...he gave her to the waves. He gave her to Annwyn. But he couldn't let her go. He needed her to be with him... more than he needed her to be at peace. His followers were as his flock. But he lied to them... Played upon their fears. Convinced them that this was the way to paradise. He believed the old legends. One of the living... for one of the dead. Annwyn might give back his child... ...if he gave it someone in return. He killed them all... to bring her back. That's what he was willing to do for his child. Hello. What happened? You fell down. How are you feeling? Hey, don't cry. Everything's gonna be all right. You know what... ...you know what you need to do? You need to picture the thing that you want more than anything else. Can you do that? Don't tell me. Don't tell anyone. But just keep picturing that thing that you want. And one day... ...you'll find that you don't have to picture it any more. It'll be right there in front of you. Can you see it? Can you be my daddy? Oh, sweetheart. I... I can't. Why not? Because I already have a daughter. What if she never comes back? Oh my God, you were there. Only I didn't jump. My father did... my mother did... but I was too afraid... I couldn't. The Shepherd took me in. And I helped him with his sheep until Ebrill came back. She came back? She came back. Alive. But something came back with her. In her. It was then the sheep began to die. He locked her in that room up there. He tried to cut the dark from her like we did with the sheep. Please, no. (WELSH) Don't, please. (WELSH) Don't hurt me please, don't hurt... But finally, I couldn't watch him hurt her any more. Please, Dafydd, unlock the door. Please. I unlocked the door. Father... And the darkness in her struck out. She should never have been brought back from death. And so I sent her back myself. I should have gone with her... ...to make sure she stayed. Because she has found a way to return from Annwyn. And that way is Sarah. My daughter is alive. Get security immediately. Yes, can I speak to my husband? He came in with a patient there, the, um... the young girl found at Ty Gweneth, earlier Oh, I'm afraid your husband has left. The young girl seems to be missing. What? Do you want to speak to her doctor? No, that's okay, thank you. Thanks very much. We'll call if there's any news. Ebrill's gone. Are you sure she'll be here? She'll be here. You wait here. Ebrill... where are you? I know you're here. You remember me, don't you? You can't stay on this side... You know that. You belong with the dead. Ebrill? Ebrill? Oh my God! Mummy! Amen. Stop... No, Ebrill! Dave? Dave? Where are you? Ebrill? Oh God. Oh my God. I never meant to hurt anyone. Adelle? Adelle? Oh Jesus. They died because of me. No. Everyone dies because of me. No. No-one's gonna die any more. You can fix it. You don't have to do it alone. I'll help you, all right? All right? Okay? She's cold down there... and alone. She's been calling to you. I know, I heard her. Looks like such a long way down. Well, it's not. Really, it's not. Ebrill! Ebrill! Adelle, don't let her! James, wait! Ebrill! Come away from there. Come away! It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. Ebrill. I can be your father. No! I can look after ya. No! Just come away from there. I know what I'm doing, please! Come away. Trust me. No! James. No. I'm going to get our baby back. No. Father, help me! Help. Help me. Adelle, there must be some other way?! No! No. I'm going to bring our baby back! No! Please Adelle! Oh, no! No! Oh God, no! Ebrill... ...where are we? Don't you recognize it? Sarah knew it right away. Sarah? Where is she? Where is Sarah?! He has her. And he doesn't think you deserve her either. I'm taking her home!

Hurry, help. Help. Go see what you've woken. Go see. Now we'll finish what you started. Don't you wanna come home, baby? Sarah, I want you to come home with me. Home? Yes. Home? Mother... home is where we came from. Stop it! See? I hate you. Sarah... I can't stand this any more! Sarah? Sarah? Please open the door.

Yes. Don't you want me back, mum? Yes, I do. Then this is the only way. Stop! There. That's it. How could you do such a thing? No. I don't know where it came from. It just happened. It just happened. You killed her. Oh God, oh God! I just want a second chance. Please God, I want a second chance. The dead don't get second chances. Mother. You know what this is, don't you? It's the end. No, no, no, no, no... I want a second chance. The dead don't get second chances. I'm not dead. I'm not dead. Oh yes you are. Don't you remember? We fell from the Stumblehead. The water filled your lungs. No... I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. Yes, yes, a drug overdose! Please, now! Oh God. Sleeping pills. Some kind of sleeping pill! Okay. Okay.
