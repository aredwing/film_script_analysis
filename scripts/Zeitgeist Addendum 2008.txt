It's only the choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money." - Bill Hicks "I realised I had the game wrong. The game was to find out what I already was." - Dr. Richard Albert We will see how very important it is to bring about, in the human mind, the radical revolution. The crisis, is a crisis of consciousness. A crisis that cannot anymore, accept the old norms, the old patterns, the ancient traditions. And, considering what the world is now, with all the misery, conflict, destructive brutality, aggression, and so on... Man is still as he was. Is still brutal, violent, aggressive, acquisitive, competitive. And, he's built a society along these lines. - J. Krishnamurti - Zeitgeist - - Zeitgeist - - Addendum - It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. - J. Krishnamurti Society today, is composed of a series of institutions. From political institutions, legal institutions, religious institutions. To institutions of social class, familiar values, and occupational specialization. It is obvious, the profound influence these traditionalized structures have in shaping our understandings and perspectives. Yet, of all the social institutions, we are born into, directed by, and conditioned upon.. There seems to be no system as taken for granted, and misunderstood, as the monetary system. Taking on nearly religious proportions, the established monetary institution exists as one of the most unquestioned forms of faith there is. How money is created, the policies by which it is governed, and how it truly affects society, are unregistered interests of the great majority of the population. In a world where 1% of the population owns 40% of the planets wealth. In a world where 34.000 children die every single day from poverty and preventable diseases, and, where 50% of the world's population lives on less than 2 dollars a day... One thing is clear. Something is very wrong. And, whether we are aware of it or not, the lifeblood of all of our established institutions, and thus society itself, is money. Therefore, understanding this institution of monetary policy is critical to understanding why our lives are the way they are. Unfortunately, economics is often viewed with confusion and boredom Endless streams of financial jargon, coupled with intimidating mathematics, quickly deters people from attempts at understanding it. However, the fact is: The complexity associated with the financial system is a mere mask. Designed to conceal one of the most socially paralyzing structures, humanity has ever endured. None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free. -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe- 1749-1832 A number of years ago, the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve, produced a document entitled "Modern Money Mechanics". This publication detailed the institutionalized practice of money creation as utilized by the federal reserve and the web of global commercial banks it supports. On the opening page the document states its objective. The purpose of this booklet is to describe the basic process of money creation in a fractional reserve banking system. It then precedes to describe this fractional reserve process through various banking terminology. A translation of which goes something like this. The united states government decides it needs some money. So it calls up the federal reserve and requests say 10 billion dollars. The FED replies saying: "sure, we'll buy ten billion in government bonds from you". So the government takes some pieces of paper, paints some official looking designs on them, and calls them treasury bonds. Then it puts a value on these bonds to the sum of 10 billion dollars and sends them over to the FED. In turn the people of the FED drop a bunch of impressive pieces of papers themselves. Only this time, calling them federal reserve notes. Also designating a value of ten billion dollars to the set The FED than takes these notes and trades them for the bonds. Once this exchange is complete, the government than takes the ten billion in federal reserve notes, and deposits it into an bank account. And, upon this deposit the paper notes officially become legal tender money. Adding ten billion to the US money supply. And there it is! Ten billion in new money has been created. Of course, this example is a generalization. For, in reality, this transaction would occur electronically. With no paper used at all. In fact, only three percent of US money supply exists in physical currency. The other 97 percent essentially exists in computers alone. Now, government bonds are by design instruments of debt. And when the FED purchases these bonds with money it essentially created out of thin air, the government is actually promising to pay back that money to the FED. In other words, the money was created out of debt. This mind numbing paradox, of how money or value can be created out of debt, or a liability, will become more clear as we further this exercise. So, the exchange has been made. And now, ten billion dollars sits in a commercial bank account. Here is where it gets really interesting. For, as based on the fractional reserve practice, that ten billion dollar deposit instantly becomes part of the banks reserves. Just as all deposits do. And, regarding reserve requirements as stated in " Modern Money Mechanics": "A bank must maintain legally required reserves equal to a prescribed percentage of its deposits". It then quantifies this by stating: "Under current regulations, the reserve requirement against most transaction accounts is ten percent. This means that with a ten billion dollar deposit, ten percent, or one billion, is held as the required reserve. While the other nine billion is considered an excessive reserve, and can be used as the basis for new loans. Now, it is logical to assume, that this nine billion is literally coming out of the existing ten billion dollar deposit. However, this is actually not the case. What really happens, is that the nine billion is simply created out of thin air on top of the existing 10 billion dollar deposit. This is how the money supply is expanded. As stated in "Modern Money Mechanics": "Of course they" the banks, "do not really pay out loans for the money, they receive as deposits. If they did this, no additional money would be created. What they do when they make loans is to accept promissory notes - loan contracts in exchange for credits - money to the borrowers transaction accounts. In other words, the nine billion can be created out of nothing. Simply because there is a demand for such a loan, and that there is a 10 billion dollar deposit to satisfy the reserve requirements. Now let's assume that somebody walks into this bank and borrows the newly available nine billion dollars. They will then most likely take that money and deposit it into their own bank account. The process then repeats. For that deposit becomes part of the banks reserves. Ten percent is isolated and in turn 90 percent of the nine billion, or 8.1 billion is now availlable as newly created money for more loans. And, of course, that 8.1 can be loaned out and redeposited creating an additional 7.2 billion to 6.5 billion... to 5.9 billion... etc... This deposit money creation loan cycle can technically go on to infinity. The average mathematical result is that about 90 billion dollars can be created on top of the original 10 billion. In other words: For every deposit that ever occurs in the banking system, about nine times that amount can be created out of thin air. Money-Jitters. Ask the obliging Bank of America for a jar of soothing instant money. M-O-N-E-Y in the form of a convenient personal loan. So, now that we understand how money is created by this fractional reserve banking system. A logical yet illusive question might come to mind: What is actually giving this newly created money value? The answer: the money that already exists. The new money essentially steals value from the existing money supply. For the total pool of money is being increased irrespective to demand for goods and services. And, as supply and demand defines equilibrium, prices rise, diminishing the purchasing power of each individual dollar. This is generally referred to as inflation. And inflation is essentially a hidden tax on the public. What is the advice that you generally get? That is, inflate the currency. They don't say: debase the currency. They don't say: devalue the currency. They don't say: Cheat the people who are safe, they say lower the interest rates. The real deception is when we distort the value of money. When we create money out of thin air, we have no savings. Yet there is so called "capital". So, my question boils down to this: How in the world can we expect to solve the problems of inflation. That is: increase in the supply of money, with more inflation. Of course it can't. The fractional reserve system of monetary expansion is inherently inflationary. For the act of expanding the money supply, without there being a proportional expansion of goods and services in the economy, will always debase a currency. In fact, the quick glance of the historical values of the US dollar, versus the money supply, reflects this point of definitively. For inverse relationship is obvious. One dollar in 1913 required $21.60 in 2007 to match value. That is a 96 percent devaluation since the Federal Reserve came into existence. Now, if this reality of inherent and perpetual inflation seems absurd and economically self defeating. Hold that thought. For absurdity is an understatement in regard to how our financial system really operates. For in our financial system money is debt, and debt is money. Here is a chart of the US money supply from 1950 to 2006. Here is a chart to the US national debt for the same period. How interesting it is, that the trends, are virtually the same. For the more money there is the more debt there is. The more debt there is the more money there is. To put it a different way. Every single dollar in your wallet is owed to somebody by somebody. For remember: the only way the money can come in to existence is from loans. Therefore, if everyone in the country were able to pay off all debts including the government, there would not be one dollar in circulation. "If there were no debts in our money system, there wouldn't be any money." Marriner Eccies - Governor of the Federal Reserve September 30th, 1941 In fact, the last time in American history the national debt was completely paid off was in 1835 after president Andrew Jackson shut down the central bank that preceded the Federal Reserve. In fact, Jackson's entire political platform essentially revolved around his commitment to shut down the central bank. Stating that one point: "The bold efforts the present bank has made to control the government... are but premonitions of the fate that awaits the American people should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or, the establishment of another like it." Unfortunately this message was short lived. And the international bankers succeeded to install another central bank in 1913, the Federal Reserve. And as long as this institution exists perpetual debt is guaranteed. Now, so far we have discussed the reality that money is created out of debt through loans. These loans are based on a banks reserves, and reserves are derived from deposits. And through this fractional reserve system, any one deposit can create 9 times its original value. In turn, debasing the existing money supply raising prices in society. And, since all this money is created out of debt, and circulated randomly through commerce, people become detached from their original debt. And a disequilibrium exists where people are forced to compete for labor in order to pull enough money out of the money supply to cover their costs of living. As dysfunctional and backwards as all of this might seem, there is still one thing we have omitted from this equation. And it is this element of the structure which reveals the truly fraudulent nature of the system itself. The application of interest. When the government borrows money from the FED, or when a person borrows money from a bank, it almost always has to be payed back with a crude interest. In other words, almost every single dollar that exists must be eventually returned to a bank with interest payed as well. But, if all money is borrowed from the Central Bank, and is expanded by commercial banks through loans, only what would be refered to as the "principal" is been created in the money supply. So then, where is the money to cover all of the interest that is charged? Nowhere. It doesn't exist. The ramifications of this are staggering. For the amount of money owed back to the banks will always exceed the amount of money that is available in circulation. This is why inflation is a constant in the economy. For new money is always needed to help cover the perpetual deficit build in to the system. Caused by the need to pay the interest. What this also means, is that mathematically the defaults and bankruptcy are literally built into the system. And there will always be poor pockets of society that get the short end of the stick. An analogy would be a game of musical chairs: For the once music stops, somebody is left out to dry. And that is the point. It invariably transfers true wealth for the individual to the banks. For, if you are unable to pay for your mortgage, they will take your property. This is particularly enraging when you realize, that not only is such a default inevitable due to the fractional reserve practice. But, also because of the fact that the money that the bank loaned to you didn't even legally exist in the first place. In 1969 there was a Minnesota court case involving a man named Jerome Daly who was challenging the foreclosure of his home by the bank, which provided the loan to purchase it. His argument was that the mortgage contract required both parties, being he and the bank, each put up a legitimate form of property for the exchange. In legal language this is called cosideration [a contract's basis. a contract is founded on an exchange of one form of consideration for another.] Mr. Daly explained that the money was, in fact, not the property of the bank. For it was created out of nothing as soon as the loan agreement was signed. Remember what "Modern Money Mechanics" stated about loans? What they do, when they make loans, is to accept promissory notes in exchange for credits. Reserves are unchanged by the loan transactions. But, deposit credits constitute new additions to the total deposits of the banking system. In other words, the money doesn't come out of their existing assets. The bank is simply inventing it, putting up nothing of it's own, except for a theoratical liability on paper. As the court case progressed, the bank's president Mr. Morgan took the stand. And in the judge's personal memorandum, he recalled that the Plaintiff - banks president - admitted that, in combination with the Federal Reserve Bank, did create the money and credits upon its books by bookkeeping entry. The money and credit first came into existence when they created it. Mr. Morgan admitted that no United States Law or Statute existed which gave him the right to do this. A lawful consideration must exist and be tendered to support the Note. The Jury found that there was no lawful consideration, and I agree. He also poetically added, "Only God can create something of value out of nothing". And, upon this revelation the court rejected the bank's claim for foreclosure, and Daly kept his home. The implications of this court decision are immense. For every time you borrow money from a bank, whether it is a mortgage loan or a credit card charge, the money given to you is not only counterfeit, it is a illegitimate form of consideration. And hence, voids the contract to repay. For the bank never had the money as property to begin with. Unfortunately such legal realizations are suppressed and ignored. And the game of perpetual wealth transfer and perpetual debt continues. And this brings us to the ultimate question: Why? During the American Civil War President Lincoln bypassed the high interest loans offered by the European banks, and decided to do what the founding fathers advocated. Which was to create an independent and inherently debt-free currency. It was called "The Greenback". Shortly after this measure was taken, an internal document circulated between private British and American banking interests, stated: "Slavery is but the owning of labor and carries with it the care of the laborers, while the European plan..is that capital shall control labor by controlling wages." This can be done by controlling the money. It will not do to allow the Greenback... as we cannot control that. The fractional reserve policy, perpetrated by the Federal Reserve which has spread in practice to the great majority of banks in the world, is in fact a system of modern slavery. Think about it, money is created out of debt. What the people do when they are in debt? They submit to employment to pay it off. But if money only can only be created out of loans, how can society ever be debt free? It cant, and that's the point. And it is the fear of losing assets, coupled with the struggle to keep up, with the perpetual debt and inflation inherent in the system compounded by the inescapable scarcity, within in the money supply itself, created by the interest that can never be re-payed. that keeps the wage-slave in line Running on a hamster wheel, with millions of others. In effect, powering an empire that truly benefits only the elite at the top of the pyramid. For, at the end of the day, who are you really working for? The Banks ! Money is created in the bank, and invariably ends up in a bank. They are the true masters, along with the corporations and governments they support. Physical slavery requires people to be housed and fed. Economic slavery requires people to feed and house themselves. It is one of the most ingenious scams for social manipulation ever created. And at its core, it is an invisible war against the population. Debt is the weapon used to conquer and enslave societies, and interest is its prime ammunition. And, as the majority walks around oblivious to this reality, the banks in collusion with governments and corporations continued to perfect and expand their tactics of economic warfare Spawning new bases, such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund [IMF], while also inventing a new type of soldier. The birth of the economic hitman. There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by sword. The other is by debt. There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by sword. The other is by debt. John Adams - 1735-1826 We economic hitmen really have been the ones responsible for creating this first truly global empire. And we work many different ways. But, perhaps the most common is that we will identify a country that has resources, like oil. And then, arrange a huge loan to that country from the World Bank or one of it's sister organizations. But the money never actually goes to that country. Instead it goes to our big corporations to build infrastructure projects in that country. Power plants, Industrial parks, Ports... Things that benefit a few rich people in that country. In addition our Corporations. But really dont have the majority to people that all. How ever, those people the whole country is left holding the huge debt. It's such a big debt they can't repay, and that's the part of the plan... They can't repay it ! And so, in some point, we economic hitman, go back to them and say "Listen" "You lost a lot of Money. Can't pay your Debt. So..." "Sell your oil " "Real cheap to our oil companies" "Allow us to build a Military Base in your Country..." "Send troops and support one of our's, to some place in the world like..." "Iraq or vote with us on the next U.N." Vote, to have their electric utility company privatized and their water and sewing system privatized and sold to US corporations or other multinational corporations. So there is a whole mushrooming thing, and it's so typical, the way the IMF and the World Bank work. They put a country in debt, and it's such a big debt they can't repay it! And then they offer to refinance that debt, and pay them more interest And you demand... this "quid pro quo" what you call a conditionality or good governance which means basically, that they got to sell off their resources, including many of their social services, their utility companies.. their school systems sometimes, their penal systems, their insurance systems... to foreign corporations. So it's a double - triple - quadruple whammie! The preceptive for a Economic Hitman really began back in the early 50's when democratically elected "Mossadegh" who was elected in Iran... He was considered to be "The hope for Democracy" in the middle east or around the world. He was in Time-Magazine's man of the year. But... one of the things that he brought on and end the implement was the idea that foreign oil companies needed to pay the Iranian people a lot more for the oil, that they were taking out of Iran and the Iranian people should benefit from their own oil. - Strange policy - we didn't like that of course, but we were afraid to do what we normally were doing, which was to send in the military instead we sent in one CIA agent, Kermit Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelts relative. And Kermit went in with a few million dollars, and was very very effective and efficient and in a short amount of time, he managed to get Mossadeg overthrown, and brought in the Shah of Iran to replace them, who always was favorable to oil, and it was extremely effective. Revolt in Iran Mobs over through Tehran. Army officers shout that Mossadeg has surrendered and his regime as virtual dictator of Iran has ended. Pictures of the Shah are paraded through the streets as sentiment reverses. The Shah is welcomed home. So back here in the United States, in Washington, people looked around and said "wow, that was easy and cheap". So this established the whole new way, of manipulating countries, of creating empire the only problem with Roosevelt was that he was a card carrying CIA agent and if he'd been caught, the ratifications could have been pretty serious, so very quickly at that point, the decision was made, to use private consultants to channel the money through the world bank or the IMF or one of the other such agencies to bring in people like me, who work for private companies so that if we got caught, it would be no govermental ramifications. when Arbenz became president of Guatemala, the country was very much under the thumbs of United Fruit company The big international cooperations and Arbenz ran on this ticket that said: "We want to give the land back to the people". And once he took power he was implementing policies that would do exactly that give the land rights back to the people. "United Fruit" didn't like that very much, and so they hired a public relations firm watch the huge campaign in the United States to convince the United States, the people...the citizens of the United States, the press of the United States and the congress of the United States, that Arbenz was a soviet puppet. And that if we allowed him to stay in power the Soviets would have a foot hole in this hemisphere. And at that point in time there was a huge fear on everybody's mind, of the Red terror, the Communist terror. And so, to make a long story short, out of this public relations campaign came a commitment on the part of the CIA and the military to take this man out. And in fact, we did! We sent in planes, we sent in soldiers, we sent in jackals, we sent everything in to take him out. And did take him out and as soon as he was removed from office, the new guy, that took over after him basically reinstated everything to the big international corporations. Including United Fruit. Ecuador, for many many years had been ruled by Pro-US-Dictators they often relatively brutal. Then it was decided to have a truely democratic ellection. Jaime Roldos ran for offence and his main goal , he said, as president would be... ... to make sure that Ecuador's resources were used to help the people. And he won! Overwhelming. By more votes than anybody had ever won anything in Ecuador. And he began to implement these policies. To make sure that the profits from Oil whant to help the people. Well... We didn't like that in the United States. I was send down as one of several Economic Hitman to change Roldos. To corrupt him. To bring him around... to let him know... you know. "OK, You can get very rich, if you and your family play our game." "But if you continue to try to keep these policys you promised... ah... You gonna go!" He wouldn't listen... He was assassinated. As soon as the plane crashed, the whole area was cordoned off. The only people allowed in were US military from a nearby base, and some of the Ecuadorian military. When an investigation was launched, two of the key witnesses died in car accidents before they had a chance to testify. A lot of very very strange things that went on around the assassination of Jaime Roldos. I like most people whove really looked at this case have absolutely no doubt that it was an assassination. And of course in my position as an economic hitman I was obviously expecting something to happen to Jaime, whether it be a coup or assassination I wasnt sure, but that he would be taken down because he was was not being corrupted, he would not allow himself to be corrupted the way we wanted to corrupt him. Omar Torrijos, president of Panama was, you know, one of my favorite people. I really, really liked him. He was very charismatic. He was a guy who really wanted to help his country. And when I tried to bribe him or corrupt him he said Look JohnHe called my Juanito. Look Juanito, I dont need the money. What I really need is for my country to be treated fairly. I need for the United States to repay the debts that you owe my people for all the destruction youve done here. I need to be in a position where I can help other Latin American countries win their independence, and be free of this terrible presence from the north. You people are exploiting us so badly. I need to have the Panama canal back in the hands of the Panamanian people. Thats what I want. And so, leave me alone, dont try to bribe me. It was 1981 and in May, Jaime Roldos was assassinated. And Omar was very aware of this. Torrijos got his family together and said Im probably next, but its Okay because Ive done what I came here to do. Ive renegotiated the canal. The canal will now be in our hands. Hed just finished negotiating the treaty with Jimmy Carter. In June of that same year, just a couple of months later, he also went down in an airplane crash. Which there is no question, was executed by CIA sponsored jackals. A tremendous amount of evidence that one of Torijjos security guards handed him at the last moment as he was getting on the plane a tape recorder. A small tape recorder that contained a bomb. It is interesting to me how this system has continued pretty much the same way for years and years and years, except the economic hit men have gotten better and better and better. Then we come up with very recently what happened in Venezuela. In 1998, Hugo Chavez gets elected president, following a long line of presidents group been very corrupt and basically destroyed the economy of the country. And Chavez was elected amidst all that. Chavez stood up to the United States, and hed done it primarily by demanding that Venezuelan oil be used to help the Venezuelan people. Well we didnt like that in the United States. So in 2002, a coup was staged which was no question in my mind, in most other peoples minds, that the CIA was behind that coup. The way that that coup was fomented was very reflective of what Kermit Roosevelt had done in Iran. Of paying people to go out into the streets, to riot, to protest, to say that Chavez was very unpopular. You know, if you can get a few thousand people to do that, Television can make it look like its the whole country and things start to mushroom. Except in the case of Chavez, he was smart enough and the people were so strongly behind him that they overcame it. Which was a phenomenal moment in the history of Latin America. Iraq actually is a perfect example of the way the whole system works. We economic hitmen are the first line of defense. We go in, we try to corrupt governments and get them to try to accept these huge loans which we then use as leverage, to basically own them. If we fail, as I failed in Panama with Omar Torrijos, and Ecuador with Jaime Roldos, men who refused to be corrupted, then the second line of defense is we send in the jackals. And the jackals either overthrow governments or they assassinate. And once that happens then a new government comes in and boy its gonna toe the line because the new president knows what will happen if he doesnt. In the case of Iraq, both of those things failed. The economic hitmen were not able to get through to Saddam Hussein. We tried very hard. We tried to get him to accept a deal very similar to what the House of Saud had accepted in Saudi Arabia, but he wouldnt accept it. And so the jackals went in to take him out. They couldnt do it. His security was very good. After all, he at one time had worked for the CIA. Hed been hired to assassinate the former president of Iraq, and failed, but he knew the system. So in 91 we send in the troops and we take out the Iraqi military. So we assume at that point that Saddam Hussein is gonna come around. We could have taken him out, of course, at that time, but we didnt want to. Hes the kind of strong man we like. He controls his people. We thought he could control the Kurds, keep the Iranians in their border, and keep pumping oil for us. And that once we took out his military, now hes gonna come around. So the economic hitmen go back in in the 90s without success. If theyd had success hed still be running the country. Wed be selling him all the fighter jets he wants, and everything else he wants, but they couldnt, they didnt have success. The jackals couldnt take him out again, so we sent the military in once again and this time we did the complete job and took him out. And in the process created for ourselves some very very lucrative construction deals had to reconstruct a country that wed essentially just destroyed. Which is a pretty good deal if you own a construction companies, big ones. So Iraq shows the three stages. The economic hitmen failed there. The jackals failed there. And as a final measure the military goes in. And in that way weve really created an empire, but weve done it very very subtly. Its clandestine. All empires of the past were built on the military, and everybody knew they were building them. The British knew they were building them, the French, the Germans, the Romans, the Greeks and they were proud of it. They always had some excuse like spreading civilization, spreading some religion, something like that, but they knew they were doing it. We dont. The majority of the people in the United States have no idea that were living off the benefits of the clandestine empire. That today there is more slavery in the world than ever before. Then you have to ask yourself, well if its an empire, then who is the emperor? Obviously our presidents of the United States are not emperors. An emperor is someone who is not elected, doesnt serve a limited term, and doesnt report to anyone, essentially. So you cant classify our presidents that way. But we do have what I consider to be the equivalent of the emperor, and its what I call the Corporatocracy. The Corporatocracy is this group of individuals who run our biggest corporations. And they really act as the emperor of this empire. They control our media, either through direct ownership or advertising. They control most of our politicians because the finance their campaigns, either through the corporations or through personal contributions that come out of the corporations. Theyre not elected, then dont serve a limited term, they dont report to anybody, and at the very top of the Corporatocracy you really cant tell whether the person is working for a private corporation or the government because their always moving back and forth. So youve got a guy who is one moment is the president of a big construction company like Haliburton, and the next moment hes Vice President of the United States. Or the President who was in the oil business. And this is true whether you get Democrats or Republicans in the office. You have this moving back and forth, through the revolving door. And in a way, our government is invisible a lot of the time, and policies are carried out by our corporations on one level or another. And then again, the policies of the government are basically forged by the Corporatocracy, and then presented to the government and they become government policy. So, there is an incredibly cozy relationship. This isnt a conspiracy theory type of thing. These people dont have to get together an plot to do things. They all basically work under one primary assumption, and that is that they must maximize profits regardless of the social and environmental costs. This process of manipulation by the corporatocracy through the use of debt, bribery and political overthrow is called: Globalization Just as the Federal Reserve keeps the american public in a postion of indentured servetude, though perpetual debt, inflation and interest the Worldbank and IMF serve this role on a global scale. The basic scam is simple: Put a country in debt you divide is own in disgression - or through corrupting the leader of that country - than impose "conditionalities" or "structual adjustment policies" often consisting of the following: Currency devaluation When the value of a currency drops, so does everything valued in it. This makes indigenes resources available to predator countries at a fraction of their worth. Large funding cuts for social programs, these usually include education and healthcare, compromising the well-being and integrity of the society leaving the public vulnerable to exploitation. Privatization of state-owned enterprises. This means that socially important systems can be purchased and regulated by foreign corporations for profit. For example in 1999 the Worldbank insisted that the bolivian government sell the public watersystem of it's third-largest city to a subsidy of the US-corporation "Bechtel". As soon as this occured waterbills for the allready impoverished local residents skyrocketed. It wasn't until after full-blown revolt by the people that the Bechtel-contract was nullified. Then there is trade liberalization or the opening up of the economy through removing any restrictions on foreign trade. This allows for a number of abusive economic manifestations, such as transnational corporations bringing in their own mass-produced products undercutting the indigenes production and ruining local economies. An example is Jamaica, which after accepting loans and conditionalities from the Worldbank lost it's largest cash crop markets due to competition with western imports. Today countless farmers are out of work for they're unable to compete with the large corporations. Another variation is the creation of numerous, seemingly unnoticed, unregulated, inhuman sweetshop-factorys, which take advantage of the imposed economic hardship. Additionally, due to production-deregulation, environmental destruction is perpetual as a country's resources are often exploited by the indifferent corporations while outputting large amounts of deliberate pollution. The largest environmental lawsuit in the history of the world, today is being brought on behalf of 30,000 Ecuadorian and Amazonian people against Texaco, which is now owned by Chevron so it's against Chevron, but for activities conducted by Texaco. They're estimated to be more than 18 times what the Exxon Valdez dumped into the Coast of Alaska. In the case of Ecuador it wasnt an accident. The oil companies did it intentionally; they knew they were doing it to save money rather than arranging for proper disposal. Furthermore, a cursory glance at the performance record of the World Bank reveals that the institution, which publicly claims to help poor countries develop and alleviate poverty, has done nothing but increase poverty and the wealth-gap. while Corporate profits soar. In 1960 the income-gap between the fifth of the world's people and the richest countries, versus the fifth in the poorest countries was thirty to one. By 1998, it was seventy-four to one. While global GNP rose 40% between 1970 and 1985, those in poverty actually increased, by 17%. While from 1985 to 2000, those living on less than one dollar a day increased by 18% Even the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress admitted that there is a mere 40% success rate of all World Bank projects. In the late 1960's, the World Bank intervened in Ecuador with large loans. During the next 30 years, poverty grew from 50% to 70%. Under or unemployment grew from 15% to 70%. Public debt increased from 240 million to 16 billion, while the share of resources allocated to the poor went from 20% to 6% In fact, by the year 2000, 50% of Ecuador's national budget had to be allocated for paying its debts. It is important to understand: the World Bank is, in fact, a U.S. bank, supporting U.S. interests. For the United States holds veto-power over decisions, as it is the largest provider of capital. And where did it get this money? You guessed it: it made it out of thin air through the fractional reserve banking system. Of the world's top 100 economies, as based on annual GDP, Walmart, General Motors, and Exxon, are more economically powerful than Saudi Arabia, Poland, Norway, South Africa, Finland, Indonesia, and many others. And, as protective trade-barriers are broken down, currencies tossed together and manipulated in floating markets, and State economies overturned in favor of competition in global capitalism, the empire expands. You get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy. There is no America, there is no democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbine, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their counsels of state- Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, min and max solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments just like we do. We no longer live in a world of Nations and Ideologies, Mr. Beale. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business Mr. Beale. Taken cumulatively, the integration of the world as a whole, particularly in terms of economic globalization and the mythic qualities of "free market" capitalism, represents a veritable "empire" in its own right... Few have been able to escape the "structural adjustments" and "conditionalities" of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, or the arbitrations of the World Trade Organization, those international financial institutions that, however inadequate, still determine what economic globalization means... Such is the power of globalization that within our lifetime we are likely to see the integration, even if unevenly, of all national economies in the world into a single global, free market system. Jim Garrison President, State of the World Forum The World is being taken over by a hand-full of business powers who dominate the natural resources we need to live, while controlling the money we need to obtain these resources. The end result will be world monopoly based not on human life but financial and corporate power. And, as the inequality grows, naturally, more and more people are becoming desperate. So the establishment was forced to come up with a new way to deal with anyone who challenges the system. So they gave birth to the 'Terrorist'. The term 'terrorist' is an empty distinction designed for any person or group that chooses to challenge the establishment. This isn't to be confused with the fictional 'Al Qaida', which as actually the name of a computer database of the U.S.-supported Mudjahedeen in the 1980's. "The truth is, there is no islamic army or terrorist group called Al Qaide. And any informed intelligence officer knows this. But there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an identified entity... The country behind this propaganda is the US." Pierre-Henry Bunel Former French Military Intelligence In 2007, the Department of Defense received 161.8 billion dollars for the so-called global war on terrorism. According to the national counter-terrorism center, in 2004 roughly 2000 people were killed internationally due to supposed terrorist acts. Of that number, 70 were American. Using this number as a general average, which is extremely generous, it is interesting to note that twice as many people die from peanut allergies a year than from terrorist acts. Concurrently, the leading cause of death in America is coronary heart disease, killing roughly 450,000 each year. And in 2007, the government's allocation of funds for research on this issue was about three billion dollars. this means, that the US government, in 2007, spent 54 times the amount for preventing terrorism, than it spent for preventing for the disease, which kills yet, as the name terrorism and Al Qaida are arbitrarilly stamped on every news report relating to any action - taken against US interests the myth grows wider! in mid 2008 the "US Attorney General" actually proposed, that the US congress officially declare war against the fantasy not to mention as of July 2008, there are now over 1 million people currently on the US terrorist watch list These so called "Counter-Terrorism Measures" of course had nothing to do with social protection - and everything to do with preserving the establishment amongst the growing Anti-American sentiment both domestically and internationally which is legitimately founded on the greed based corporate empire expansion that is exploiting the world The true terrorists of our world, do not meet at the darks at midnight or scream "Allah Akbar" before some violent action the true terrorists of our world, wear 5000 dollar suits, and work in the highest positions of finance, government and business So, what do we do ? How do we stop a system of greed and corruption, that has so much power and momentum How do we stop this aberrant group behavior, which feels no compassion for say, the millions slaughtered in Irak and Afghanistan So the corporatacity can control energy resources and opium production for Wall St. profit Before 1980, Afghanistan produced After the US/CIA backed Mujahideen won the Soviet/Afghan war. by 1986 they were producing 40% of the world's heroin supply. By 1988, they were producing But then, something unexpected happened. The Taliban rose to power, and by 2000 they had destroyed most of the opium fields. Production dropped from 3.000+ tons to only 185 tons, a 94% reduction. On Sept. 9th 2001, the full Afghanistan invasion plans were on President Bush's Desk Two days later they had their excuse Today, opium productions in US controlled Afghanistan, which now provides more than 90% of the world's heroin, breakes new production records nearly every year. How do we stop a system of greed and corruption that condemns poor populations to "Sweatshop-Slavery" for the benefit of Madison Avenue? Or that engineers false-flag terrorattacks for the sake of manipulation? Or that generates "Build-in-Modes" of social operation, wich are inherently exploited. Or that systematicly reduces several libertys, and violates human rights. In order to protect it self, from it's own shortcomings. How do we deal with the numerous covert institutions? Such as the Council on Foreign Relations? The Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Group? and other undemocraticaly elected groups which behind closed doors collude to control the political, financial, social and enviromental elements of our lives. in order to find the answer, we must first find, the true undermind cause For the fact is, the selfish, corrupt, power and profit based groups are not the true source of the problem They are symptoms! Greed and Competition are not the result of immutable human temperament ...greed and gear of scarcity are in fact being created and amplified the direct consequence is that we have to fight with each other in order to survive Bernard Liertaer-founder of the EU currency System my name is Jacque Fresco, I'am an industrial designer and a social engineer I'am very much interested in society and developing a system that might be standable for all people first of all, the world corruption is a monitory invention, that aberrant behavior, behavior that's destructive for the well being of people, or you dealing with human behavior and human behavior appears to be environmentally determinant meaning, if you were raised by the seminole indians as a baby, never saw anything else you hold that system. And this goes for nations, for individuals, for familys they try to indoctrinate their children to their preticular faith in their country and make them feel like their are part of the land and they built a society, which they call established they established a workable point of view and intend to perpetuate that whereas, all societies are really emergent, not established and so they fight new ideas, that would interfere with the establishment Goverments try to perpetuate that which keeps them in power, people are not elected to political office to change things They are put there, to keep things the way they are. so you see, the bases of corruption is in our society Let me make it clear. All nations then are basically corrupt because they tend to uphold existing institutions. I don't mean to uphold, or downgrade all nations, but communism, socialism, facism, the free enterprise-system and all other sub-cultures are the same they are all basicly corrupt the most fundamental characteristic of our social institutions is an necessity for Self-Preservation, but they're dealing with the cooperation from religion or goverment the foremost interest is to preserve the institution itself For instance the last thing an oil company would ever want is the utilization of a energy that was outside of its control. For it makes that company less relevant to society. Likewise the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union was in reality a way to preserve and perpetuate the established economic and global hegemony of the United States. Similarly religions condition people to feel guilty for natural inclinations, each claiming to offer the only path to forgiveness and salvation. At the heart of this institutional self-preservation lies monetary system. For it is money that provides the means for power and survival. Therefore, just as a poor person might be forced to steal in order to survive, it is a natural inclination to do whatever is needed to continue an institutions profitability. This makes it inherently difficult for profit-based institutions to change, for it puts in jeopardy not only the survival of large groups of people, but also the coveted materialistic lifestyle associated with affluence and power. Therefore, the paralyzing necessity to preserve an institution regardless of its social relevance is largely rooted in the need for money, or profit. Whats in it for me?, is why people think. And so if a man makes money selling a certain product, thats where hes going to fight the existence of another product that may threaten his institution. Therefore, people cannot be fair. And people do not trust each other. A guy will come over to you and say Ive got just the house youre looking for hes a salesman. When a doctor says I think your kidney has to come out, I dont know if hes trying to pay off a yacht or that my kidney has to come out. Its hard in a monetary system to trust people. If you came into my store and I said This lamp that Ive got is pretty good, but the lamp next door is much better, I wouldnt be in business very long. It wouldnt work. If I were ethical, it wouldnt work. So when you say industry cares for people thats not true. They cant afford to be ethical. So your system is not designed to serve the well-being of people. If you still dont understand that there would be no outsourcing of jobs if they cared about people. Industry does not care. They only hire people because it hasnt been automated yet. So dont talk about decency and ethics, we cannot afford it and remain in business. It is important to point out that regardless of the social system; whether fascist, socialist, capitalist, or communist; the underlying mechanism is still money, labor, and competition. Communist China is no less capitalistic than the United States. The only difference is the degree by which the state intervenes in enterprise. The Reality is that "Monetary-ism", so to speak, is the true mechanism, that guides the interests of all the countries on the planet. The most agressive and hence dominant variation of this monetary-ism is the free enterprise system. The fundamental Perspective as put forth by early free market economists, like Adam Smith, is that self interest and competition leads to social prosperity, as the act of competition creates incentive, which motivates people to persevere However, what isn't talked about, is how a competition based economy invariably leads to strategic corruption, power an wealth consolidation, social stratification, technological paralisis, labor abuse and ultimately a covert form of government dictatorship by the rich elite The word "Corruption" is often defined as - moral perversion - If a Company dumps toxic waste into the ocean, to save money Both people recognize this as "Corrupt-behavior" On a more subtle level, when Walmart moves into a small town and forces small businesses to shut down for they are unable to compete, a grey area emerges. For what exactly is Walmart doing wrong? Why should they care about the Mom and Pop organizations they destroy? Yet even more subtly, When a person get's fired from their job, because a new machine has been created, witch can do the work for less money. People tend to just accept that as... "The way it is!" Not seen the inherent -Corrupt inhumanity- of such an action. Because the fact is: Wether it is dumping toxic waste. Having a monopoly enterprise or downsizing the workforce, the motiv is the same! Profit! They are all different degrees of the same self-preserving machinism, which always put's the well-being of people second to monetary gain. Therefor, corruption is not some "Byproduct" of Monetaryism. It is the very Foundation! And while most people acknowledge this tendency on one level or another, majority remains naive as to the broad ramifications of having such a selfish mechanism as the guiding mentality in society. "Internal documents show that after this company positively absolutely knew they had a medication that was infected with the AIDS virus, they took the product off the market in the US, and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia and Latin America. The US government allowed it to happen. The FDA allowed this to happen, and now the government is completely looking the other way. Thousands of innocent hemophiliacs have died from the AIDS virus. This company knew absolutely that it was infected with AIDS, they dumped it because they wanted to turn this disaster into a profit." So you see, you have built-in corruption. Were all chiseling off each other, and you cant expect decency in that sort of thing. a feeling that they dont know who to elect. They think in terms of a democracy, which is not possible in a monetary based economy. If you have more money to advertise your position, the position you desire in government, that isnt a democracy. It serves those in positions of differential advantage. So its always a dictatorship of the elitist, the financially wealthy. We can either have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cant have both. Louis Brandeis, Supreme Court Justice It is an interesting observation to note how seemingly unknown personalities magically appear on the scene as presidential candidates. Then before you know it, somehow you are left to choose from a small group of extremely wealthy people who suspiciously have the same broad social view. Obviously its a joke. The people placed on the ballot are done so because they have been pre-decided to be acceptable by the established financial powers who actually run the show. Yet many who understand this illusion of democracy, often think If only we could just get our honest, ethical politicians in power, then we would be okay. Well, while this idea of course seems reasonable in our established oriented world view, it is unfortunately another fallacy. For when it really comes down to what is actually important, the institution of politics and thus politicians themselves, have absolutely no true relevance as to what makes our world and society function. Its not politicians that can solve problems. They have no technical capabilities. They dont know how to solve problems. Even if they were sincere, they dont know how to solve problems. Its the technicians that produce the desalinization plants. Its the technicians that give you electricity. That give you motor vehicles. That heat your house, and cool it in the summer time. Its technology that solves problems, not politics. Politics cannot solve problems cause they are not trained to do so. Very few people today stop and consider what it is that actually improves their lives. Is it money? Obviously not. One cannot eat money, or stuff money into their car to get it to run. It is politics? All politicians can do is create laws, establish budgets, and declare war. Is it religion? Of course not, religion creates nothing except intangible emotional solace for those who require it. The true gift that we as human beings have, which has been solely responsible for everything that has improved our lives, is technology. What is technology? Technology is a pencil, which allows one to solidify ideas on paper for communication. Technology is an automobile, which allows one to travel faster than feet would allow. Technology is a pair of eye glasses, which enables sight for those who need it. Applied technology itself is merely and extension of human attributes, which reduces human effort, freeing humans from a particular chore or problem. Imagine what your life would be like today without a telephone, or an oven, or a computer, or an airplane. Everything in your home, which you take for granted; from a doorbell, to a table, to a dishwasher is technology generated from the creative scientific ingenuity of human technicians. Not money, politics, or religion. These are false institutions. and writing your congressman is fantastic. They tell you, Write your congressman if you want something done. The men in Washington should be at the forefront of technology. The forefront of human study. The forefront of crime. All the factors that shape human behavior. You dont have to write your congressman. What kind of people are they that are appointed to do that job? The future will have great difficulty and the question thats raised by politicians is: How much will a project cost? The question is not: How much will it cost?, but: Do we have the resources? And we have the resources today to house everyone, build hospitals all over the world, build schools all over the world, the finest equipment in labs for teaching and doing medical research. So you see, we have all that, but were in a monetary system, and in a monetary system theres profit. And what is the fundamental mechanism that drives the profit system besides self-interest? What is it exactly that maintains that competitive edge at its core? Is it high efficiency and sustainability? No. That isnt part of their design. Nothing produced in our profit based society is even remotely sustainable or efficient. If it was, there wouldnt be a multi-million dollar a year service industry for automobiles. Nor would the average lifespan for electronics be less than three months before theyre obsolete. Is it abundance? Absolutely not. Abundance, as based on the laws of supply and demand, is actually a negative thing. If a diamond company finds ten times the usual amount of diamonds during their mining, it means the supply of diamonds has increased, which means the cost and profit per diamond drops. The fact is; efficiency, sustainability, and abundance are the enemies of profit. To put it into a word, it is the mechanism of scarcity that increases profits. What is scarcity? Its based on keeping products valuable. Slowing up production on oil raises the price. Maintaining scarcity of diamonds keeps the price high. They burn diamonds at the Kimberly Diamond Mine. Theyre made of carbon. That keeps the price up. So then, what does it mean for society when scarcity, either produced naturally or through manipulation is a beneficial condition for industry? It means that sustainability and abundance will never ever occur in profit system. For it simply goes against the very nature of the structure. Therefore, it is impossible to have a world without war, or poverty. It is impossible to continually advance technology to its most efficient and productive states. And most dramatically, it is impossible to expect human beings to behave in truly ethical or decent ways. People use the word instinct because they cant account for the behavior. They sit back and they evaluate with their lack of knowledge, and they say things like Humans are built a certain way. Greed is a natural thing. as though theyd worked for years on it. And its no more natural than wearing clothing. What we want to do is to eliminate the causes of the problems. Eliminate the processes that produce greed, and bigotry, and prejudice, and people taking advantage of one another, and elitism. Eliminating the need for prisons and welfare. We have always had these problems because we have always lived within scarcity, and barter, and monetary systems that produce scarcity. If you eradicate the conditions that generate what you call socially offensive behavior, it does not exist. A guy says Well listen, are they in-born? No its not! There is no human nature, theres human behavior, and thats always been changed throughout history. Youre not born with bigotry, and greed, and corruption, and hatred. You pick that up within the society. war, poverty, corruption, hunger, misery, human suffering will not change in a monetary system. That is, therell be very little significant change. Its going to take the redesigning of our culture, our values, and it has to be related to the carrying capacity of the earth, not some human opinion or some politicians notions of the way the world ought to be. Or some religions notion of the conduct of human affairs. And thats what The Venus Project is about. The society, that we're about to talk about, is a society that is free of all the old superstitions, incarceration, prisons, police cruelty and law. all laws will disappear and the professions will disappear, that are no longer valid, such as stockbrokers, bankers, advertising. Gone! Forever! Because it's no longer relevant When we understand that it is technology devised by human ingenuity which frees humanity and increases our quality of life we then realize, that the most important focus we can have is on the intelligent management of the earth's resources For, it is from these natural resources, we gain the materials to continue our path of prosperity Understanding this we than see, that money fundamentally exists as a barrier to these resources for, virtually everything has a financial cost. And why do we need money to obtain these resources? Because of real or assumed scarcity. We don't usually pay for air and tap water, because it is in such high abundance, selling it would be pointless So then, logically speaking If resources and technologies, applicable to creating everything in our societies such as houses, cities and transportation were in high enough abundance, there would be no reason to sell anything. Likewise, if automation and machinery was so technologically advanced, as to relieve human beings of labor there would be no reason to have a job And with these social aspects taking care of, there would be no reason to have money at all. So the ultimate question remains: Do we on earth have enough resources and technological understanding to create a society of such abundance, that everything we have now could be available without a price tag and without the need for submission through employment Yes, we do! We have the resources and technology to enable this at a minimum, along with the ability to raise the standard of living so high that people in the future will look back at our civilisation now and gawk how primitive and immature our society was. What the Venus Project proposes is an entirely different system that's updated to present day knowledge We've never given scientists the problem of how do you design a society that would eliminate boring and monotonous jobs that would eliminate accidents in transportation that would enable people to have a high standard of living that would eliminate poisons in our food give us other sources of energy, that are clean and efficient we can do that out there A resource based economy The major difference between a resource based economy and a monetary system is that a resource based economy is really concerned with people and their well-being where the monetary system has become so distorted that the concerns of the people are really secondary, it they're there at all The products that are turned out are for: How much money you can get. If there is a problem in society and you can't earn money from that solving that problem, than it won't be done The resource based economy is really not close to anything that's been tried. And with all our technology today we can create abundance. It could be used to improve everyone's livestyle Abundance all over the world if we use our technology wisely and maintain the environment. It's a very different system, and it's very hard to talk about, cause the public is not that well enough informed as to the state of technology. Energy At present we don't have to burn fossil fuels. We don't have to use anything that would contaminate the environment. There are many sources of energy available. Alternative energy solutions pushed by the establishment, such as hydrogen, biomass and even nuclear are highly insufficient, dangerous and exist only to perpetuate the profit-structure the industry has created. When we look beyond the propaganda and self-serving solutions put forth by the energy companies we find a seemingly endless stream of clean abundant and renewable energy for generating power. Solar and wind energy are well known to the public But the true potential of these mediums remains unexpressed Solar energy derived from the sun has such abundance that one hour of light at high noon contains more energy than what the entire world consumes in a year If we could capture 1/100 of this energy the world would never have to use oil, gas or anything else The question it is not availability but the technology to harnesst it and there are many advanced mediums today which could accomplish just that. If they were not hindered by the need to compete for market share with the established energy power structures Then there's wind energy. Wind energy has long been denounced as weak And due to being location driven, impractical. This is simply not true. The US department of energy admitted in 2007 that if wind was fully harvested in just three of Americas 50 states it could power the entire nation And there are the rather unknown mediums of tidal and wave power Tidal power is derived from tidal shifts in the ocean Installing turbines which capture this movement generates energy In the United Kingdom 42 sites are currently noted as available Forecasting that 34% of all the UK's energy could come from tidal power alone. Wave power, which extracts energy from the surface motions of the oceans is estimated to have a global potential of up to 80.000 terawatt-hours a year. This means 50% of the entire planets energy usage could be produced from this medium alone. Now, it is important to point out that tidal, wave, solar and wind power requires virtually no preliminary energy to harness, unlike coal, oil, gas, biomass, hydrogen and all the others In combination these four mediums alone, if efficiently harnessed through technology, could power the world forever that being said, there happens to be another form of clean renewable energy, which trumps them all. Geothermal power Geothermal energy utilizes, what is called "heat mining" Which, through a simple process using water, is able to generate massive amounts of clean energy. In 2006 an MIT report on geothermal energy found that currently available in the earth with the possibility of 2.000 ZJ being easily tapable with improved technology. The total energy consumption of all the countries on the planet is about half of a zetajule a Year This means about 4000 years of planetary power could be harnessed in this medium alone and when we understand that the earth's heat generation is constantly renewed, this energy is really limitless It could be used forever! These energy sources are only a few of the clean renewable mediums available And as time goes on we will find more. The grand realization is that we have total energy abundance without the need for pollution traditional conservation or, in fact, a price tag! And what about transportation? The prevailing means of transportation in our societies is by automobile and aircraft. Both of which predominantly need fossil fuels to run. In the case of the automobile, the battery technology needed to power an electric car that can go over a hundred miles and hour for over two hundred miles on one charge, exists and has existed for many years. However, due to battery patents, controlled by the oil industry, which limits their ability to maintain market share, coupled with political pressure from the energy industry, the accessibility and affordability of these technologies is limited. There is absolutely no reason, other than pure, corrupt profit intersts, that every single vechicle in the world cannot be electric, and utterly clean, with zero need for gasoline. As far as airplanes, it is time we realized that this means of travel is inefficient, cumbersome, slow and causes far too much pollution. This is a mag-lev train. It uses magnets for propulsion. It is fully suspended by a magnetic field and requires less then two percent of the energy used for plane travel. The train has no wheels, so nothing can wear out. The current maximum speed of versions of this technology, as used in Japan, is 361 miles per hour. However this version of the technology is very dated. An organisation called ET3 which has connection with the Venus project, has established a two-based mag-lev that can travel up to 4000 miles per hour in a motionless frictionless tube which can go over land or under water. Imagine going from L.A to New York for an extended lunchbreak or from Washington D.C. to Beijing, China, in two hours. This is the future of continental and intercontinental travel. Fast, clean, with only a fraction of the energy usage we use today for the same means. In fact, between mag-lev technology, advanced battery storage and geothermal energy there will be no reason to ever burning fossil fuel again. And we can do this now, if we were not held back by the paralyzing profit structure. Now America is inclined towards fascism. It has a propensity by its dominant philosophy and religion to uphold to fascist point of view. American industry is essencially a fascist institution. If you dont understand that, the minute you punch that time clock you woke into a dictatorship. We are given notions about the respectibility of work. And I realy look at it as being paid slavery. Youre brought up to believe that you shall earn your living by the sweat of your brow. That holds people back. Freeing people from drudgery, repetitive jobs which make them ignorant, you rob them. In our society, that is a resourced based economy, machines free people. You see, we can't imagine that because we never known that kind of world. If we look back at history, we see a very clear pattern of machine automation slowly replacing human labour. From the dissapearence of the elevator man to the near full automation of an automobile production plant. The fact is, as technology grows the need for humans in the work force will continioully be diemineshed. This creates a serious clash, which proves the falsness of the monitary based labour system. For human employment is in direct competition with technological developement. Therefore given the fundamental priority of profit by industry, people through time will be continually layed off and replaced by machine. When industry takes on a machine instead of shortening the work day, they downsize. You loose your job so you have a right to fear machines. In a high technology resourced based economy, it is conservative to say that about 90% of all current occupations could be phased out by machines. Freeing humans to live their life without servitude. For this is the point of technology itself. And through time with nano technology and other highly advanced forms of science it is not far fetch to see how even complex medical procedures could be performed by machines as well. And based on the pattern with much higher success rates than humans get today. The path is clear but our monetary based structure which requires labour for income blocks this progress. Humans need jobs in order to survive. The bomb line is that this system must go or we will never be free and technology will be constantly paralyzed. We have machines that clean out sewers and frees human being doing that. So look at machines as extensions of human performance. Furthermore many occupations today will have simply no basis to exist in a resourced based economy. Such as anything assosiated with the management of money, advertising along with a legal system itself. For without money, a great majority of the crimes that are commited today would never occur. Virtually all forms of crimes are consequence in the moneatry system, either directly or by neurosis inflicted through financial deprevation. Therefore laws themselves could eventually become extinct. Instead of putting up a sign "drive carefully slippery when wet" put a abrasive on the highway so it is not slippery when wet. And when a person gets in car that drunk and a car oscillates at great deal there's a little pendulum that swings up and back and that will pull the car over to the side - not a law. Solution. Put sonar and radar on automobiles so they cant hit one another. Man-made laws are attempts to deal with occuring problems and not knowing how to solve them they make a law. In the United States, the most privatised, capitalist country on the planet, it shall come as no surprise that it also has the largest prison population in the world - growing every year. Statistically, most of these people are uneducated and come from poor, deprived societies. And contrary to propaganda, it is this enviromental conditioning, which lures them into criminal and violent behaviour. However society, looks the other way and regard to this point. The legal and prison systems are just more examples of how our society avoids examining the root-causes of behaviour. Billions are spend each year on prisons and police, while only a fraction is spend on programs for poverty, which is one of the most fundamental variables responsible for crime to begin with. And, as long as we have an economic system, which preferes and infact creates scarcity and deprivation, crime will never go away. If people have access to the necessities of life without servitude, debt, barter, trade; they behave very differently. You want all this things availabe without a price tag Now then, youve gotta have a price tag. What will motivate people? Men gets just everything what he wants, he's just lay around in the sun. This is the myth they perpetuate. People in our culture are trained to believe that the monetary system produces incentive: If they have access to all things, why should they want to do anything? They would loose their incentive. That's what you're taught to support the monetary system. When you take money out of the scenerio, there would be different incentives, very different incentives. When people have access to the necessities of life, their incentives change. What about the moon and the stars? New incentives arise. If you make a painting, that you enjoy, you will enjoy giving it to other people - not selling it. I think most of the education, that I've seen today, is essentially producing a person for a job. It's very specialized. They're not generalists. People don't know a lot about a lot of different subjects. I don't think you can get people to go to war, if they knew a lot about a lot of things. I think education is mostly rote and they're not taught how to solve problems, they're not given the tools, emotionally or whithin their own field, of how to do critical thinking. In a resource based economy, the education would be very different. Our society's major concern is mental development and to motivate each person to their highest potential. Because our philosophy is the smarter people are people are the rich of the world because everybody becomes a contributor. The smarter your kids are, the better my life will be. Because they'll be contributing more constructively to the environment and to my life. Because everything that we devise with an resource based economy would be applied to society. There would be nothing to hold it back. Patriotism, weapons, armies, navies, all that is a sign, that we're not civilized yet. Kids will ask their parents: Didn't you see the necessity of the machines? Dad, couldn't you see, that war was inevitable when you produce scarcity when you produce scarcity? Isn't it obvious? Of course, the kid will understand that you're pinheads - raised merely to serve the established institutions. Were such an abominable, sick society that we wont make the history books. Theyll just say that large nations took land from smaller nations, used force and violence. Youll get history talked about as corrupt behavior all the way along until the beginning of the civilized world. Thats when all the nations work together. World unification, working toward common good for all human beings and without anyone being subservient to anyone else. Without social stratification whether it be technical elitism or any other kind of elitism, eradicated from the face of the earth. The state does nothing because there is no state. The system I advocate, a resource based global economy is not perfect, its just a lot better than what we have. We can never achieve perfection. My country is the world and my religion is to do good. Thomas Paine, 1737-1809 The social values of our society, which has manifested in perpetual warfare, corruption, oppressive laws, social stratification, irrelevant superstitions, environmental destruction, and a despotic socially indifferent profit oriented ruling class is fundamentally the result of a collective ignorance of two of the most basic insights humans can have about reality. The emergent and symbiotic aspects of natural law. The emergent nature of reality is that all systems; whether it is knowledge, society, technology, philosophy, or any other creation will, when uninhibited, undergo fluid perpetual change. What we consider commonplace today such as modern communication and transportation, would have been unimaginable in ancient times. Likewise, the future will contain technologies, realizations, and social structures that we cannot even fathom in the present. We have gone from alchemy to chemistry, from a geocentric universe to a heliocentric from believing that demons were the cause of illness to modern medicine. This development shows no sign of ending, and it is this awareness that aligns us and leads us on a continuous path to growth and progress. Static empirical knowledge does not exist, rather it is the insight of the emergence of all systems we must recognize. This means we must be open to new information at all times, even if it threatens our current belief system, and hence, identities. Sadly society today has failed to recognize this, and the established institutions continue to paralyze growth by preserving outdated social structures. Simultaneously, the population suffers from a fear of change. For their conditioning assumes a static identity and challenging ones belief system, usually results in insult and apprehension. For being wrong is erroneously associated with failure. When in fact to be proven wrong should be celebrated. For it is elevating someone to a new level of understanding, furthering awareness. The fact is, there is no such thing as a smart human being, for it is merely a matter of time before their ideas are updated, changed, or radicated. And this tendency to blindly hold on to a belief system, sheltering it from new possibly transforming information is nothing less than a form of intelectual materialism. The monetary system perpetuates this materialism not only by its self-preserving structures, but also throught the countless number of people who have been conditioned into blindly and thoughtlessly upholding these structures, therefore becoming self-appointed guardians of the status quo. Sheep which no longer need a sheep-dog to control them. For they control each other by ostracizing those who step out of the norm. tendency to resist change and uphold existing institutions for the sake of identity, comfort, power and profit is completely unsustainable; and will only produce further imbalance, fragmentation, distortion, and very invariably destruction. Its time to change. From hunters and gatherers, to the agricultural revolution, to the industrial revolution, the pattern is clear. It is time for a new social system which reflects the understandings we have today. The monetary system is a product of a period of time when scarcity was a reality. Now with the age of technology it is no longer relevant to society. Gone with the aberrant behavior it manifests. Likewise, dominant world views such as theistic religion operate with the same social irrelevancy. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and all of the others exist as barriers to personal and social growth. For each group perpetuates a closed world view. And this finite understanding that they acknowledge is simply not possible in an emergent universe. Yet religion has succeeded in shutting down the awareness of this emergence by instilling the psychological distortion of faith upon its followers. Where logic and new information is rejected in favor of traditionalized outdated beliefs. The concept of god, is really a method of accounting for the nature of things. In the early days people didnt know enough about how things formed, how nature worked. So they invented their own little stories, and the made god in their own image. A guy that gets angry when people dont behave right. He creates floods, and earthquakes, and they say its and act of god. A cursory glance at the suppressed history of religion reveals that even the foundational myths themselves are emergent culminations developed through influence over time. For example a cardinal doctrine of the Christian faith is the death and resurrection of Christ. This notion is so important that the Bible itself states And if Christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain Yet it is very difficult to take this account literally, for not only is there no primary source denoting this supernatural event in secular history, awareness of the enormous number of pre-Christian saviors who also died and were resurrected immediately puts this story in mythological territory by association. Early church figures such as Tortullian went to great lengths to break these associations, even claiming that the devil caused the similarities to occur. Stating in the second century The devil, whose business is to pervert the truth, mimics the exact circumstances of the Divine Sacraments. He baptizes his believers and promises forgiveness of sins he celebrates the oblation of bread, and brings in the symbol of the resurrection. Let us therefore acknowledge the craftiness of the devil, who copied certain things of those that be Divine. What is truly sad however, is that when we cease the idea that the stories from Christianity, Judaism, Islam and all the others are literal history, and accept them for what they really are, which are purely allegorical expressions derived from many faiths, we see that all religions share a common thread. And it is this unifying imperative that needs to be recognized and appreciated. Religious belief has caused more fragmentation and conflict than any other ideology. Christianity alone has over 34,000 different subgroups. The Bible is subject to interpretation. When you read it, you say I think Jesus meant this. I think Job meant that. Oh No! He meant this. So you have the Lutheran, the Seventh-day Adventist, the Catholic, and a church divided is no church at all. And this point on division, which is a trademark on all theistic religions brings us to our second failure of awareness. The false assumption of separation through the rejection of the symbiotic relationship of life. Apart from the understanding that all natural systems are emergent, where all notions of reality will be constantly developed, altered, and even eradicated; we must also understand that all systems are in fact invented fragments merely for sake of conversation. For there is no such thing as independence in nature. The whole of nature is a unified system of interdependent variables, each a cause and a reaction, existing only as a concentrated whole. You dont see the plug to connect to the environment, so it looks like were free wandering around. Take the oxygen away, we all die immediately. Take plant life away, we die. And without the sun, all the plants die. So we are connected. We really must take into account the totality. This isnt just a human experience on this planet, this is a total experience. And we know we cant survive without plants and animals. We know we cant survive without the four elements, you know? And so, when are we really going to start taking that into account? Thats what it is to be successful. Success depends on how well we relate to everything around us. Im very aware of the fact that my grandson cannot possible hope to inherit a sustainable, peaceful, stable, socially just world unless every child today growing up today in Ethiopia, in Indonesia, in Bolivia, in Palestine, in Israel also has that same expectation. You gotta take care of the whole community or youre gonna have serious problems. And now we have to see that the whole world is the community. And we must all take care of each other that way. And its not just a community of human beings, a community of plants and animals and elements. And we really need to understand that. Thats whats gonna bring us joy too, and pleasure. Thats whats missing in our lives right now. We can call it spirituality, but the fact of the matter is joy comes from that bliss of connectedness. Thats our god spirit. Thats that side of ourselves that really feels it, and you can feel it deep inside you. Its this amazing wonderful feeling, and you know it when you get it. You dont get it from money, you get it from connection. "Now if that isnt a hazard to this country. How are we gonna keep building nuclear weapons, you know what I mean? Whats gonna happen to the arms industry, when we realize were all one? Its gonna fuck up the economy. The economy thats fake anyway. Which would be a real bummer. You can see why the governments crackin down on the idea of experiencing unconditional love. Bill Hicks I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, 1929-1968 Once we understand that the integrity of our personal existences are completely dependent on the integrity of everything else in our world, we have truly understood the meaning of unconditional love. For love is extensionality and seeing everything as you and you as everything can have no conditionalities, for in fact, we are all everything at once. If its true that were all from the center of a star, every atom on each of us from the center of a star, then were all the same thing. Even a Coke machine or a cigarette butt in the street in buffalo is made out of atoms that came from a star. Theyve all been recycled thousands of times, as have you and I. And therefore, its only me out there. So what is there to be afraid of? What is there that needs solace seeking? Nothing. Theres nothing to be afraid of because its all us. The trouble is we have been separated by being born and given a name and an identity and being individuated. Weve been separated from the oneness, and thats what religion exploits. That people have this yearning to be part of the overall one again. So they exploit that. They call it god, they say he has rules, and I think its cruel. I think you can do it absent religion. - George Carlin, 1937-2008 an extraterrestrial visitor examining the differences among human societies would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities Our lives, our past and our future are tied to the sun, the moon and the stars We humans have seen the atoms which constitute all of nature and the forces that sculpted this work And we, we who embody the local eyes and ears and thoughts and feelings of the cosmos, we have begun at least to wonder about our origins star stuff contemplating the stars, organized collections of ten billion billion billion atoms, contemplating the evolution of nature, tracing that long path by which it arrived at consciousness here on the planet earth Our loyalties are to the species and to the planet. We speak for earth. Our obligation to survive and flourish is owed not just to ourselves but also to that cosmos ancient and vast from which we spring! We are one species. We are star stuff harvesting star light. Who Speaks for Earth? - Carl Sagan, 1934-1996 Its time to claim the unity our outmoded social systems have broken apart, and work together to create a sustainable global society where everyone is taken care of and everyone is truly free. Your personal beliefs, whatever they may be are meaningless when it comes to the necessities of life. Every human being was born naked, needing warmth, food, water, shelter. Everything else is auxiliary. Therefore, the most important issue at hand is the intelligent management of the Earths resources. This can never be accomplished in a monetary system, for the pursuit of profit is the persuit of self interest and therefore imbalance is inherent. Simultaneously, politicians are useless. For our true problems in life are technical not political. Furthermore, ideologies that separate humanity such as religion need strong reflection in the community in regards to its value, purpose and social relevancy. Hopefully through time religion will loose its materialism and basis in superstition and move into the useful field of philosophy. The fact is, society today is backwards, with politicians constantly talking about protection and security rather than creation, unity and progress. The US alone now spends about $500 billions dollars anually on defense. That is enough to send every high school senior in America to a four year college. In the 1940s the Manhattan Project produced the first true weapon of mass destruction. This program employed 130,000 people, at an extreme financial cost. Imagine what our life would be like today if that group of scientists, instead of working on a way of killing people, worked on a way to create a self-sustaining abundant world. Life today would be very very different if that was their goal. Instead of weapons of mass destruction, it is time to unleash something much more powerful. Weapons of Mass Creation (WMCs). Our true divinity is in our ability to create. And armed with the understanding of the symbiotic connections of life, while being guided by the emergent nature of reality, there is nothing we cannot do or accomplish. Of course, we face strong barriers in the form of established power structures that refuse to change. At the heart of these structures is the monetary system. As explained earlier, the fractional reserve policy is a form of slavery through debt, where it is literally impossible for society to be free. In turn, free market capitalism in the form of free trade, uses debt to imprison the world and manipulate countries into subservience to a handful of large business and political powers. Apart from these obvious amoralities, the system itself is based on competition, which immediately destroys the possibility of large scale collaborations for the common good. Hence paralyzing any attempt at true global sustainability. These financial and corporate structures are now obsolete, and they must be outgrown. Of course, we can not be naive enough to think that the business and financial elite are going to subscribe to this idea for they will lose power and control. Therefore, peaceful and highly strategic action must be taken. The most powerful course of action is simple. We have to alter our behavior to force the power structure to the will of the people. WE MUST STOP SUPPORTING THE SYSTEM. The only way the establishment will change is by our refusal to participate while continuously acknowledging its endless flaws and corruptions. Theyre not gonna give up the monetary system, because of our designs of what wed recommend. The system has to fail, and people have to lose confidence in their elected leaders. That will be a major turning point if The Venus Project is offered as a possible alternative. If not, I fear the consequences. The trends now indicate that our country is going bankrupt. The probability is our country will move towards a military dictatorship to prevent riots and complete social breakdown. Once the US breaks down, all the other cultures will undergo similar things. As of now, the world financial system is on the brink of collapse due to its own shortcomings. The comptroller of currencies stated in 2003 that the interest on the US national debt will not be affordable in less than ten years. This theoretically means total bankruptcy for the US economy and its implications for the world are immense. In turn the fractional reserve based monetary system is reaching its theoretical limits of expansion and the banking failures you are seeing are just the beginning. This is why inflation is skyrocketing, all debt is at record levels and the government and FED are hemorrhaging new money to bailout the corrupt system. For the only way to keep the banks going is by making more money. The only way to make more money is to create more debt and inflation. It is simply a matter of time before the tables turn and no one is willing to make new loans while defaults grow as people are unable to afford their current loans. Then the expansion of money will stop and contraction will begin on a scale never before seen. Ending a century long pyramid scheme. This has already begun. Therefore, we need to expose this financial failure for what it is, using this weakness to our advantage. Here are some suggestions: One. Expose the banking fraud. Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of America are the most powerful controllers within the corrupt Federal Reserve system. Its time to boycott these institutions. If you have a bank account or credit card with any of them, move your money to another bank. If you have a mortgage, refinance with another bank. If you own their stock, sell it. If you work for them, quit. This gesture will express contempt fo the true powers behind the private banking cartel known as the Federal Reserve. And create awareness about the fraud of the banking system itself. Two. Turn off the TV news. Visit the emerging independent news agencies on the internet for your information. CNN, NBC, ABC, FOX and all the others present all news pre-filtered to maintain the status quo. With four corporations owning all major media outlets, objective information is impossible. This is the true beauty of the internet. And the establishment has been losing control because of this free flow of information. We must protect the internet at all times, as it is truly our savior right now. Three. Dont ever allow yourself, your family, or anyone you know, to ever join the military. This is an obsolete institution now used exclusively for maintaining an establishment that is no longer relevant. US soldiers in Iraq work for US corporations, not the people. Propaganda forces us to believe that war is natural and the military is an honorable institution. Well if war is natural, why are there 18 suicides every single day by American veterans who have post-traumatic stress disorder? If our military men and women are so honored, why is it that Four. Stop supporting the energy companies. If you live in a detached house, get off the grid. Investigate every means of making your home self-sustainable with clean energy. Solar, wind, and other renewable energies are now affordable consumer realities, and considering the never ending rising costs of traditional energies, it will likely be a cheaper investment over time. If you drive, get the smallest car you can and consider using one of the many conversion technologies that can enable your car to be a hybrid, electric, or run on anything other than establishment fuels. Five. Reject the political system. The illusion of democracy is an insult to our intelligence. In a monetary system, there is no such thing as a true democracy, and there never was. We have two political parties owned by the same set of corporate lobbyists. They are place into their positions by the corporations, with popularity artificially projected by their media. In a system of inherent corruption the change of personnel every couple of years has very little relevance. Instead of pretending that the political game has any true meaning focus your energy on how to transcend this failed system. Six. Join the movement. Go to the thezeitgeistmovement.com and help us create the largest mass movement for social change the world has ever seen. We must mobilize and educate everyone about the inherent corruption of our current world system along with the only true sustainable solution, declaring all the natural resources on the planet as common heritage to all people, while informing everyone as to the true state of technology and how we can all be free if the world works together rather than fights. The choice lies with you. You can continue to be a slave to the financial system and watch the continuous wars, depressions and injustice across the globe while placating yourself with vain entertainment and materialistic garbage; or you can focus your energy on true, meaningful, holistic, lasting change which has the realistic ability to support and free all humans with no one left behind. But in the end the most relevant change must occur first inside of you. The real revolution is the revolution of consciousness, and each one of us first needs to eliminate the divisionary materialistic noise we have been conditioned to think is true; while discovering, amplifying, and aligning with the signal coming from our true empirical oneness. It is up to you. What we are trying in all these discussions and talks here is to see if we cannot radically bring about a transformation of the mind. Not accept things as they are but to understand it, to go into it, to examine it, give your heart and your mind with every thing that you have to find out. A way of living differently. But, that depends on you and not somebody else. Because in this there is no teacher, no pupil, theres no leader, no guru, theres no master, no savior. You yourself are the teacher, and the pupil, youre the master, youre the guru, you are the leader, you are everything! And to understand is to transform what is. - J. Krishnamurti Revolution is now! We would like to thank Peter Joseph & his crew for this jaw dropping documentary. To Jeff Hemry for his arrangment of the complete transcript. Join the Facebook groups. Spread the knowledge and open your mind! Get prepared for the Z-DAY. Salvation is close... Regards from Efendisiz & 911 turbo [ZEUS] "Together we stand, divided we fall"
