Where have you been all night? You know what time it is now? I know, I know. Who's that? He's my classmate. My Dad. We've got a project to discuss. Why not go to library? Go to work. Don't be so old-fashioned, OK? We'll stop here. Let's eat first. OK. Yes, sir. Let's grab a bite. Hey, let's eat. George. You stay behind. I want to talk to you. Why did you apply to reopen that old case? I've gone through materials again. Something doesn't look right. It doesn't look like a suicide. I suspect the man was murdered. Let me tell you: They've been solved. And that's that. Don't waste police effort anymore. Chief, even if a case is closed, it doesn't mean the truth was uncovered The point of investigating is to dig out the truth. You know how many old cases you've dug up? Just one has been worth it so far. t's fine if you don't care about promotion, but don't drag others down. If one case in 10 can be overturned, it's not a waste of effort, Chief. I know. Your wife's suicide is still on your mind. You keep thinking she was murdered. t's been five years. Let it go. Don't mention my wife. She wouldn't have left nothing behind. Not even a suicide note. I knew her so well. She wouldn't have killed herself. We've been together since the Academy. I don't want you to mess up. Take care. Eugene Wang. You've served your time and today you'll be out on parole. We hope 20 years in prison helped you reflect on your crime and reform. Now you're going to be released on parole. To help you reintegrate into community, the Social Welfare Department found you a music store job. You've got to report to your parole officer every week. Here are your personal belongings, and the prison wages you've earned Why didn't you take my call? Sorry. Don't you know Daddy worries about you? The timetable says you finish by 5:30 and you should be here at 5:45. What were you doing? I went to the toilet. Your period? Tell Daddy next time, OK? Hello, Mr Tsui! Dean. Picking up your daughter? Yes, Dean. I heard your retirement concert sold out fast. Many fans couldn't get tickets. You'd better add two more shows. Ticket sales aren't my concern. I don't deal with money matters. I never get involved. Of course you don't. Time to go home and practice piano. I'd better let you go. OK. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye, Dean. Get in the car. Who was the boy staring at you this afternoon? Why was he smiling at you? What's your relationship with him? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing's going on. What do you mean by nothing? Say it clearly, won't you? Don't lie to me! Don't you lie to me! I saw how he stared at you, I saw it! Ridiculous! Ridiculous! I hit you. You should find it shameful too. I'm just trying to teach you. There are too many bad people in this world. Everybody just wants something from you. It won't happen again. What won't happen again? I won't be with boys anymore. Remember what you promised to me. I'm just here to protect you. I just want to protect you. You can only be safe by my side. Do you understand? No one cares and loves you more than me it's hard to find a hut with windows. $3,000 is a total bargain. Hey! Want to scare me? You're so chicken-hearted. See? isn't my timing perfect? Are you stalking me? Not really. I just want to bump into you. Hurry up! Why would someone call you? Who has your phone number? Who? Answer the phone. Zoe, answer the phone. Who is it? Someone's calling you. Take the call! I told you the phone was for your mother and for me to Contact you during emergencies. You gave the number to others. You just give everybody your phone number. Daddy knows full well what those boys think. They want to sleep with you! They all want to. Do you want them to have sex with you? You're so selfish! Really, I didn't. Stand up. Don't go to school anymore. Can you hear me? Don't go to school! School means nothing to you. They just want to screw you to death. Do you get it? Hey! Such a hurry. I've got the cake for you too. Of course you need a cake for the birthday. I nagged my daughter so much to spend her birthday with me. Wow! Why buy so many things? Are they yours? I bought them for you. Even a kitchen knife? Can you not pull it out? Not on the street. I never go to your place. How can I tell if you have a knife at home or not? Really have no idea what to get. Digital camera! Me? OK. I'll help you buy it. Also in local news: A father with serious heart problems risked his life to save his daughter by donating half his liver to her. t's just a liver. For his daughter's sake, he would even give his life. The operation was conducted this morning at Queen Mary Hospital. The liver transplant was a success. Don't you agree? The daughter is stable but the father is still in critical condition. I got it for you. Thanks a lot. Come. How about I carry the cake to your place? Why don't you work on cases if you have time? Actually, I need to use your bathroom. There's a toilet over there. Great! Happy birthday! Another year older. Thank you. Know what I'm doing right now? I'll go back later. What is it? The coroner arrived? Fine, I'll be right there. Just go. Sorry, but it's really a big case. Just go! Why all the fuss about cutting the cake? Go investigate your big case, Inspector Lam. What kind of attitude is that? What's wrong with my attitude? Kids without a mother around are all like this. You investigate day and night. The whole house is filled with victims' photos. So why can't you dig up why Mum killed herself? How do you know I didn't try? Her death has nothing to do with me. I didn't want your Mum to die either. t's a waste of time talking to you. I should have celebrated with my friends instead of cutting the cake here with you. Goodbye, victims! Well and truly dead. Much of the victim's skin has been burned. Totally disfigured. His face and fingerprints are burned and mangled. If you want to throw up, step aside and wait. We checked the area all around here. There's nothing on him: no clothes, no wallet, no ID. We can't work out his identity yet. Great. That's plenty to look into. The victim was severely injured. Soaked, burned, beaten... Say what? Soaked, burned, beaten, everything. We need to investigate in the lab before confirming the cause and time of death. Judging from the injuries and bloating, he can't have been dead more than 24 hours. The killer is smart. Tying weights to sink the victim to the seabed. Thought no one would find the body. So how was the body discovered? This beach is deserted. Few people come here. These people came here to fish today. One of them dropped a watch in the water. They searched for it and found the dead body too. sn't it fate? He even wanted to hide the victim's identity. Why go so far smashing his face up like that? If it was just to hide the identity, burning would have done the job. No need to disfigure his face too. Seems like revenge. From what we can see, the police have surrounded the crime scene. The police cannot ascertain the victim's identity at the moment. SBTV will keep you updated on the case. Man Yuen-yee, News Channel, reporting. All up, the victim sustained 28 lethal wounds. Judging from organ damage and bruises, the cause of death is a blow to the head. The skin on his armpits... and his inner thighs is intact. The burning was post-mortem. Also, there was alcohol in his bloodstream. He'd probably drunk a lot. The murderer must've been strong to do all this. Why did he do that? Why did he make it so complicated? There must be a reason. Must have some connection to the motive. All this was obviously done by the murderer. What is he trying to hide? And there's something else. The body was in the water, but there's no seawater or sand in the stomach. Based on the digestion in the victim's stomach and wound analysis, the time of death was around 10 pm two nights ago, give or take 30 minutes. So the beach isn't the crime scene. Probably somewhere else. Another important discovery is this button. It was inside the victim's mouth. Did forensics work out the victim's identity? They sent the report an hour ago. Have a look, sir. Here's a mockup of the victim after analysing the skull, tissue and DNA. He's a celebrity. That'll make the front pages. Look up everyone in Contact with him and bring them all in. What kind of people are these? Who would live in a place like a prison? That night, my daughter and I stayed home all night. Have you finished taking photo? I want to ask you another question. Do you love your husband? What do you mean by that? Of course I do. No one would love my husband as much as I do. And he loved this home too. If you love him so much, weren't you worried that he hadn't come home? Didn't I answer this before? How could I worry so much? I don't know. Daddy would often go drinking with friends or stay in the studio all night. My husband was a first-class musician. He needed time to himself. We're getting old as couple. I wouldn't bother asking him too much. Zoe, go back to your room. Wow! Your husband put up many of his photos on the wall. Over all these years, I took all those photos of my husband. Don't mind if I walk around to appreciate the art, do you? Don't be too upset. Be strong. Don't worry. We'll do our best to catch the murderer. Thank you. Thanks for your hard work. No need to thank us now. We haven't caught the murderer yet. What a good kid. Your daddy must have loved you very much. We won't finish checking till next month if you keep adding names to the chart. I need to check everyone linked to the Tsui family within the next two days. t's like a needle in a haystack. If we expand the investigation to everyone who knows the Tsui family, by then the murderer might have fled town. If we don't investigate, how could we know? We're not prophets. Sorry. He had another daughter? She died 21 years ago. Eva Tsui? How come she looks like Zoe Tsui? She's been dead 21 years. How to check on her? Check on a ghost? She's related to the family. How did she die? t's horrible. someone broke into her house and raped her and killed her. The case was solved. Here's the culprit. Caught red-handed and sentenced to life. Give me the case file. He looks familiar. Hello? Hello? Why are you staring at me? I didn't stare at you. I was looking for you. I knew you'd be here drinking. Wow! You stink! When did you last take a shower? You're like this in every investigation. You know what? You've done the right thing. What do you mean? Eva was 18 that year. A 19-year-old pervert stalked her. It was some mental problem or he couldn't stop his obsession. One night he sneaked into the house, tried to rape her and ended up killing her. And finally killed her. It says here she was seriously assaulted with a heavy object and beaten to death. The man's name is Eugene Wang. He was released on parole two years early last week. What's more, Zoe looks a lot like Eva, right? Zoe Tsui, an inspector wants to speak to you. What brought you here? We want to know more about your family. How's your parents' relationship? Not good. They seldom talk. But my mother cares for my dad very much. Don't suspect her. We haven't suspected your mother. Did your parents ever say you had an elder sister? What elder sister? You had an elder sister, but she died the year you were born. Actually, someone tried to rape her and beat her to death. What was her name? Her name was Eva. The killer was just released from jail. Don't worry. The cases might not be related, but you'd better be careful. This is my number. Call anytime if anything goes wrong. Inspector Lam... Nothing. Did you notice the girl didn't look frightened, and became calmer instead. She looked blank. What was she thinking? Could the two cases be connected? Actually all along only you've thought they are connected. No one else does. Judging from your look, you got nothing, right? Depends on how you look at it. He's up there! This way! Ying! Ying! Give way! Bite it hard. Don't loose it. I will always be with you. Hey! You scare me all the time. Ready to eat? Let's go! Come on. Hurry up. Don't leave a note like that again. t's creepy. What note? I didn't write this. I will always be with you. Are you mute? The murder of Eva Tsui 20 years ago. I read the old newspapers. You first pleaded not guilty, but then you pleaded guilty later. Did you really kill Eva Tsui? No? You didn't kill her? Or you didn't rape her? t's all over. I don't want to mention it. Was Eva pretty? You couldn't have women in prison. How did you cope? Screwing men? Screwed by men? I heard you inmates know how to have fun. Did you go find a woman when you got out? You've been holding back for 20 years. How could you bear it? At your age, do you still masturbate? Wow! Such great tolerance? Do you know Han Tsui is dead? He was Eva's father. Do you hate him? I wanted him to die. So? So did you kill him? I'm asking you. Where you were on December 16 at around 10 pm? Were you with anyone? Just walking around? By yourself? Did anyone see you? You can check. What else do you want to ask? Mrs Tsui, washing the ground? You don't have a maid? My husband didn't want to hire servants. He said it's inhuman. We should do our own housework. You listened to your husband a lot. Zoe, go back to your room. Do you have another daughter named Eva? But she passed away years ago. It has nothing to do with my husband's death. Why are you asking me this? Zoe seemed unaware she had an elder sister. You talked to her? You're a family. I never thought you'd keep this from her. Such a horrible death, but you act as if she never existed. Do I have to bring her up every day? My husband and I were devastated by her death. I don't get why you bring this up. It has nothing to do with my husband's death. Relax. Relax, OK? How can you be so sure it's unrelated? When Eva died, Zoe was barely a year old. There's no need for her to know about such a terrible death. Zoe was barely a year old when Eva died. You and your husband must have had a loving relationship if you had another child after 18 years. Both Eva and Zoe were adopted by my husband and I. I couldn't have kids. And he loved children so much. So both girls were adopted. We found out that when Eva was murdered, you spent a lot of money on a top UK barrister to prosecute the suspect. As a result, the suspect was denied appeal and sentenced to life. You know all about it. Why are you asking me? Mrs Tsui, if you're not willing to cooperate, how can we find the murderer of your husband? Back then, your husband hated the killer, right? Yes or no? Why do you keep bringing up the past? It has nothing to do with his murder. You're not the murderer. How can you tell? There might be leads. If he killed your daughter, you wouldn't let him go either. t's only natural. But the boy kept saying he was innocent. He killed Eva in the house. The police caught him red-handed. Did Eva have a boyfriend? No. She never went out. Normal just like everybody else. I really can't remember all the details. OK. Don't you think Zoe looks very much like Eva? They're sisters. Of course they look alike. Didn't you say they were adopted? We've treated them both as our own children. That's strange. You took them as your own children, but there's no memorial tablet for Eva. Who are you trying to fool? I don't know what you're talking about. I can't remember. Mrs Tsui! Mrs Tsui. I have a weak heart. I need to rest. I'm sorry, Mrs Tsui. We have no more questions. Go away. Go away. Please take a rest. I got this from Wang's high school. Top grades in maths, chemistry and physics. His teacher's comments said he was aloof but smart and talented in music. Look at the activities column. In 1988, He was the Champion in the Asian Youth Chinese Chess Tournament. Damn it! I didn't even make the final round that year. So he's a clever and meticulous person. Think about it. He's been in jail for 20 years. Would he have no plan at all? Something must have gone wrong. Too careless, too obvious. But he doesn't seem so stupid. Eva: All men close to you must die. Inspector Lam? This is ZoeTsui. I checked with the music store where Wang works. Turns out he hasn't shown up since last week. We're on the right track. We'd better bring him in. Must we wait till something goes wrong? But there's no evidence linking Wang to Tsui's murder. Sir. What if we can't lay charges after a high-profile arrest? Step up protection of the mother and daughter. George, you've been given five days to dig up evidence and a motive. After that, I don't care if you find anything or not. I'll need to bring Wang in. Wang's brother? According to Correctional Services, Wang is staying at your house. Where is he now? That's not true. He's only visited once since his release. He asked me to lend him money. Do you remember this classmate? Eugene Wang. This guy. Have a close look first. Secondary school was so long ago. How can I remember? Leave me alone. How can that be? You're so young. It was just a few years ago. Take a look first. it's Eugene Wang. You're his younger brother. Anything about him is none of my business. I gave him $50,000 to get rid of him. He took the cash and left. Wang? I remember him. The mute. When he just arrived, he kept saying he was innocent and wanted to appeal. He tried to commit suicide by stabbing himself with a pencil. But he failed, and the complaints stopped. He didn't hang out with anyone. I didn't hear him make a noise. He jogged and worked out every day in his cell. He took computer lessons and learned about the Internet. He hardened himself up like steel. As you know, the inmates have no entertainment in jail. They most like to toy with him. Since he first joined He was bullied every day. He coped with the bullying at the start. He must have mental aberration. But finally he went crazy. Once, he fought against four in the bathroom. He stabbed them. One became blind. Two were seriously injured. And one was nearly killed. Since that fight, no one dared go near him. Everyone to be distant from him Stabbing the neck with a pencil to commit suicide? That'd take some determination. Eugene Wang? Of course I remember him. I don't believe he killed Eva Tsui. You know Eva Tsui? They were really close. I couldn't really take it. But his old statement said they didn't know each other. I've got no idea what his statement says. But my statement 20 years ago said they were dating. They stayed in Lantau overnight without telling family. How could they not be dating? I took pictures for them too. Uncle Lung, I'm looking into a rape and murder from 21 years ago. According to the file, you were one of the officers in charge. That's tough. I've been retired more than seven years. A murder that happened in a mansion on the Peak. Oh...The girl's father was a celebrity. Since I emigrated, my memory has deteriorated. The boy kept saying he was innocent. Didn't you think something was fishy? We caught the boy at the crime scene. There was no doubt at all. CCTV footage showed him sneaking into the house. The girl's father was an eyewitness too. I've never seen anyone killed so brutally. But, some of his classmates can prove they were lovers. Can't a lover rape and kill? What does this prove? There was plenty of evidence in that case. It was 1988. I really can't remember clearly. It was back when Spencer was in charge. He hated rapists the most. You're sure it was 1988? Uncle Lung, no smoking indoors. You're still so stubborn and never give up. I remember when you had just left the Academy as a PC. Maybe you saw him too. We showed no mercy if a suspect wouldn't confess. He was a tough nut to crack. Really? it's him? And you were stupid enough to ask everyone what happened. Asking why the suspect was so heavily beaten up. Luckily I stopped you and asked you keep out of it. You didn't ask - you beat me up. You wouldn't quit without a beating, would you? We had an eyewitness and evidence. Spencer's judgement wouldn't be wrong. Why would he accuse the boy for no reason? She's a very pretty girl, Yeung. Why did you kin her? Yes you did. And you did this? Fucking look at the picture, Yeung! Look at the photo! Look at it! Did you kill her? It wasn't me. Son of bitch! Go to hell. Damn you! So it's him. What is it? Hello? Hello? Ying? Ying. Ying! I couldn't catch him. OK. OK... I couldn't catch him. I've been waiting for you for days. The gods are watching from above. Don't you believe that? I do. Catch him once you get enough evidence. Got the message. Inspector Lam has come. Once we get evidence from him, we should arrest him. Yes, sir! I checked. You and Eva picnicked quite often in Lantau. Have you been back to here ever since your release? What did you guys do in Lantau back then? Did you make out? She was already your girlfriend. Why were you so impatient? You might have failed to rape her, but there was no need to kill, right? You didn't kill Eva. You hated her father. So as soon as you were released, you killed him, right? I know you were convicted for something you didn't do 20 years ago. Listen. You have to remember Zoe is not Eva. Did jail time turn you into a pervert? Your lover Eva is dead. Zoe won't love someone who's been in jail 20 years. The world's different now, wake up! I won't let you hurt Zoe! Don't move! Put down the weapon. Turn around! Everyone ready! Go save Inspector Lam! Yes, sir! What's wrong with you? A dozen officers couldn't catch a pervert? We've got the evidence and the motive. No matter what, we have to bring him in! Now! Yes, sir! Let's go. Hurry up. He had every chance to kill you or get the button back. Why would he be so careless? Actually, when he tried to kill me that night, I didn't know I grabbed something from him. Did he leave the evidence in your hand on purpose? To save us some trouble? You're right. By giving us this, it's like he turned himself in. You mean... the button found in Han Tsui's mouth was left there on purpose by Wang too? You've finally broken through. Does it make sense? Yes. Little B has discovered Wang's hideout. He's been staying near the Tsui mansion the whole time! So crazy? Zoe's dress? Where are you going? I want to go out for a walk. Don't go anywhere. Stay here. When the case is over we'll move back to England. He's even recorded Zoe's voice. He must have sneaked into the house, and planted a bug there. Inspector Lam. The evidence is here. The suspect's missing button! Did Tsui make Wang so angry that Wang killed him? He mistook Zoe as Eva. Hello? Lastest Update! Yang was at Zoe's house last night! OK. I'll be right there. Actually, I've discovered something. I'm not sure if it's relevant. Say it. When we came in just now, I saw Mrs Tsui cleaning the ground. The last time we came, she was also cleaning it. Altogether... I've seen her cleaning the ground four times. I'm afraid I've caught your paranoia. Remember the coroner said there was no seawater in the victim's stomach? Call forensics right away. Yes, sir. Don't you know you're really smart? I know. t's blood. Mrs Tsui, hindering police work and obstructing justice are serious criminal of fences. I don't know anything. I stayed home with my daughter all night. I knew nothing about it. If you knew nothing, why would you know to clean the floor? Fei, call an ambulance. What is Mrs Tsui trying to hide? If the Tsui house is the crime scene, how could they not notice someone was killed in the house? The pervert intended to leave plenty of evidence. Probably was trying to hide something. The evidence he left when he killed Han Tsui was to hide that this is actually the crime scene. Even if the mother and daughter were the murderers, they wouldn't have had the time or energy to move the body to the beach. If they were at home that night, how could they not be aware? Could it be that he's not the murderer? From Wang's house, you can clearly see the balcony Tsui fell off. If Wang is the murderer, every lead and all the evidence we found, could have been made up by Wang. He's pointing at himself. If he deliberately did that, there can only be one reason. He's trying to hide the real murderer. The question is, Whom is he trying to protect? Whom is he trying to protect? Eva. In other words, Zoe. Inspector Lam. You asked me to check out Han Tsui's personal warehouse and his safe deposit box. In the warehouse I found lots of photos taken by him. I discovered something. Not sure if it's relevant. Look at these. Eva? I knew it. What is it? Bring Mrs Tsui and Zoe back for interrogation at once, even if Mrs Tsui fakes fainting again. Did your husband have a special interest in young girls? You're crazy. Where's your police protection tonight? I waited the whole day and sneaked out I have something to tell you. Your husband was sick psychologically. Is that why you wanted a divorce? It had nothing to do with that. Your husband abused Eva, and was molesting Zoe too. But you dared not say a word for fear of ruining his reputation. Or did you let him do that to your adopted daughters? Crazy. Actually you hate your daughters, because you think they stole your husband. No, I don't. t's not true. I don't! Were you happy when Eva died? No, I wasn't. I really wasn't. It was my fault. If you keep trying to hide the truth, I'll charge you with murder. Don't you know you're the prime suspect? My husband brought it on himself. In this house, no one dared say no to my husband. He loved Eva very much. I knew he was fond of her. Why did you keep quiet about it? Keep quiet? I'd been married to my husband for decades. He was perfect. I just couldn't destroy his reputation. I thought if I could pretend that I didn't see or hear anything, he'd repent and go back to normal. I never thought Eva would be killed. Because I knew she was trying to run away from home. She had a boyfriend. Her father found out and was furious. He locked up Eva at home, forbidding her to go to school or anywhere. Then Eva told me she was carrying her boyfriend's baby. She asked me for help. I dared not say yes, as I'd never done anything against my husband's wishes. Later she secretly gave birth to Zoe. Why would your husband allow that? He thought it was his child. He never made sexual advances on Zoe. Later as Zoe grew up, she looked so much like Eva. I noticed my husband sometimes mistook her as Eva. I didn't want to make the same mistakes again. That night my husband died, he was totally drunk. Don't go to school anymore! Understand? Don't go to school! School means nothing to you. Zoe... You'll be ruined... Zoe! Open the door! You'll be screwed to death. Don't you know that? Han Tsui! I've been telling you all the time. Han Tsui! Why don't you listen to me? Open the door! Sooner or later... you'll be just like your mother. Eva, you betrayed me. t's you who betrayed me! Daddy, what are you talking about? You think I'm scared of you? You think I feel guilty? Daddy, I'm Zoe... Shut up! I killed you. But you cheated me first! You went with that fucking man! And then you ask me to forgive you? Daddy, I'm Zoe... I don't know what you're talking about. Eva! And you tried to come back here. I gotta look at you every day. I'm the one who raised your daughter. I've been a good man my whole life. I am looking at you every day. You think I feel guilty? Why do you make me suffer? it's me! When I got in, my husband had already fallen off the balcony. We dared not look down for a long time. I only wanted to wash the blood off the ground. Please don't investigate anymore. You want to hide this incident because it was Zoe who pushed your husband off the balcony? No. It had to be an accident. He fell off accidentally. I killed my foster father. I did it. I made him fall off the balcony by accident that night. You betrayed me! So who is Zoe's birth father? Inspector Lam. We couldn't find Zoe all night, nor her classmate. Aren't you guys watching her 24/7? She said she had to meet a friend. Something happened. Call the station. Station, at World Wide Exchange Centre in Admiralty. If you find the suspect, immediately ask for support, over. Hello? Yes. OK. Got it. Thanks. Inspector Lam, two colleagues found Wang. On the roof of World Wide Exchange Centre. Fei, split up. Yes, sir! Put down your gun! Put down your gun! Freeze! Put your hands up and surrender. You are suspected of murder, plus multiple assaults and attacking police. You've been surrounded. Eugene Wang. Tell me. You didn't plan to kill Zoe because she's the daughter of you and Eva. Both Eva and you were victims. you wanted to take revenge on Han Tsui. But Zoe was one step ahead of you. You've been trying to mislead the police into thinking you wanted to hurt her, but in fact you wanted carry her guilt as the murderer. Is that the truth? Tell me. Answer me! Have you ever held your daughter on your shoulders? My god! Is that the truth? Answer me. Answer me! Inform Inspector Lam. Colleagues, when the reporters come, can you keep them 10 meters away? And we have to clear the crime scene. Ying, Thanks. Inspector Lam, Since my failed attempt at suicide in prison, I'd never talked to anyone. Eva and I had been together since high school. When she was 19, she was pregnant with my child. Her father was infuriated and locked her up at home until she gave birth secretly. I could only climb up at night and watch through the window. Hello, it's me. Listen carefully. Yes. He's drunk. Come over right now to pick me up. I'll carry the baby too. The three of us can run away together. I'll leave right now and pick you up. Wait for me. What are you doing? Who are you talking with? You want to go out? I love you so much but you betray me again? You want to call him? Why don't you call him? Goto hell! You really wanna call him? Call now! I know he's out there! I know he's out there! Nobody can betray me! Get up! You wanna run away? Get up! Come on! You wanna run away? You asked him to pick you up, right? Look outside! Look! Look! Look outside! Ask him to come and take you away! You wanna call, right? Say it! What do you want to say? I've saw a murder Inspector Lam, is the truth really that important? It doesn't matter who really killed Han Tsui. Even if you know the truth, it might not do anyone any good. I really want to know how it feels to see your own daughter grow up in front of your eyes. I truly envy you, Inspector Lam. She said she has come to turn herself in. I made my father die by making him fall off the balcony accidentally. I'm sorry you had to protect me for so long. I've been waiting for you. I knew you'd come to confess in person, because I can see in your eyes that you have a conscience. I just don't want that man to take up my guilt. Why are you helping me? Do you know my birth mother? Do you know my father? Tell me who he is. Who's the man that was protecting me? The man helping me, who is he? His name is Eugene Wang. Don't forget him. Sunbathing? I've got three Jay Chou concert tickets for you. It was so hot. I queued for several hours. Don't you want to come along? Of course. In fact, there's one more thing that bothers me. This again? Give me a break. If Wang wanted to take the rap for Zoe, why didn't he turn himself in at the start? If it wasn't for a stubborn cop like you, he and Zoe would have walked off free. Why on earth would anyone suddenly dig up a 20-year-old case? If it was anyone else, they would have stopped when the button was found. If it wasn't for you, the plan would have been perfect. I'm leaving. How about dinner together before the concert? We'll eat at home. Join us if you want. Just come up to my place. Great!
