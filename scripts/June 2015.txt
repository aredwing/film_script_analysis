The other, dark and powerful. JUNE Between the world we build a circle, never ending universal. We are filled with spirit power, send it down. Release the chain. This was the moment I lost her. I lost her to the darkness. 9 years later Hey. You sure you don't want to grab a drink? I'm sure, go ahead. - Alright. - Have fun. Hello. Tell me, is she the vessel? - I'm not sure. - I need you to be sure. I like to visit her at her current foster home now. - Learn everything you can. - Thanks. You boys aren't causing a stir of my new girl, are you? Now. Sitting on the front porch, clutching a teddy bear, ain't no way to make friends. I told her to go out and play. Is that true? Your new mama tell you to do something, you're going to do it now, okay? Oh shit. Alright. Damn it, I got to go to work. - Alright, baby. Give me some sugar. - Alright. - Alright. - You go shake that ass. You, go play. Don't sit there acting all weird. Good god. You heard her. Go on, get it. Jesus. Whatever. I need a smoke. Oh. Many never know what it's like to be desperately alone. To have no one. That is something we share. How do you feel June is adjusting? Great. She's June, right, honey. Great. Yeah. How about you, June? What do you think? Do you like it here? She loves it here. Don't you, June? Sweetheart. Tell him. Honey, about how you-you brothers and sisters all get along and... and-and pizza night, and all that stuff. Tell him how you even have your own bed, right? Yeah. I give you money for the ice cream truck everyday. Tim makes you eggs for breakfast. Tell him how happy you are here. Is that right, June? Do you smoke inside around the kids often? No. Never. May I see June's room? Sure, let me just go straighten it up. No, that's fine. June would you show me your room. Thanks. - That went well. - Yeah, great. So, uh. You and your 3 sisters sleep here? Kind of crowded, huh. Tell me the truth, do you really like it here? June, look at me. I know what happens when you get upset. You do? Bad things happen, right? Sometimes. Okay, June. Here's the deal. I know it must be difficult staying here. Too many children. Adults that don't understand you, right? June. I'm going to make you a promise, okay. I promise to find you a new home. Would you like that? Yeah, a place with a garden. With a... You're the only child. You have a room of your own. - With flowers? - Yeah. In a nice neighbour, with a family that loves you and understand you. If anything that starts happening that upsets you. I want you to call me. Okay, call me. Here's my number. I will answer anytime, day or night. You call me if you need help, okay? June. I'm going to get you out of here. DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES VICTOR EMMANUEL - CASE WORKER Hey, Eeks.

Get back inside the house. Freak. As the moon rises and the sun falls, fire will illuminate the sky. And the ashes of man will rain down. Shit. What the hell? Candy! She called the darkness, Aer. And Aer was growing stronger. - Candy, the kid's possessed. - Who? The kid! Whatever her name is. June. Stop it, Aery. Why are you doing this? You are a vessel. Before people, before machines, there is only us. Hey. Taste like... Whoa. You're too gone. Happy birthday, America. Happy birthday, America. God! Go, go play. Go do something. I don't think so. Looks all burnt. Hey! Hey! Do not burn down the place for god sakes. - Shut the f... - What is so funny? Jeez. She's creepy. Like, something's bad wrong with her, you know what I mean? I think she's retarded. I mean... She's always talking to herself. That's weird. Hey. Light it, and throw it at her. No. Come on. Don't be a little girl. I'm not a girl. Satisfied. Give me the bear, you little retard. You want your stupid bear? You're just a little retard, aren't you? I know what happens when you get upset... get upset. - Your parents are dead. - Your parents are dead. You're just a little retard, aren't you? ...retard, aren't you? ...retard, aren't you? Air, I am. Fire, I am. Water, earth, spirit I AMMMMM !!! - Is she with you? - She's right here. How is her emotional state? Everything. Everything is under control. I'm taking her to the Anderson house tomorrow. Excellent work. June, you understand how important this is, right? You may not get another chance like this at a nice house. - It's not me - I know, it's your imaginary friend. - She's not imaginary. - Can you see her? Can anybody else see her? June, whatever happened in the trailer park, that was an accident, right? Nobody there could agree about what they saw. Do you remember that night? No. June, you like the Andersons, right? - Yes. - Did you like those.... I never thought I would see her again. Hi, June. So glad you're here. Welcome, June. It's okay, sweetheart. You know, Daddy just want to capture your beautiful face so that we can always remember this day. You know you are beautiful, don't you. I am? Yes, you really are. - Come on. - June's probably tired from our exit interviews today. Why don't we just go inside? Do you want to see your new house? Let's go inside. Hey, June. Would you like to come with me? I want to show you something. I want to, thank you again for... getting June for us. I'm just happy we were able to find her a new home. A good home. Did you remember when I mentioned that June has an imaginary friend? Lily, she spoke to some of her friends, and she said that a lot of kids have imaginary friends. June's friend is called Aer. She calls her, Aery. She spells it, a-e-r. You know, Dave's been all around the world taking photos. That one is his favorite. When he heard you like nature, he said he wanted you to have it. I like your little bear. Aer, she calls her Aery. Right. In the past, June has tried to blame some accidents she's had on Aer, which I wanted you to know. Although this is perfectly normal behaviour for a child in her circumstances. So, June. You like your room? Well. I know your new mommy Lily, put a lot of hard work and effort into it, so... I'm glad you like it. June? Do you think you like to call me Mom or... Mommy. We don't have to decide now. Right, June? June. Are you looking forward to start a new school on Monday? Yep. You'll make a lot of new friends. That'd be cool, right? There you go. Now, if you need me in the middle of the night, I'm right across the hall, okay? Do you want us to leave the door open? Yes. Sweet dreams. Ooo. We have to be quiet. Hi, sweetheart. Hi. So, do you like to read? I heard that you did. You know, I think it would be good if you read some of these books for school. Can I see what're you drawing? Can I see? June. We just want you know that we both love you, okay? Okay. Are you ready for your first day at school? Class, I want you to meet our newest student, June. Can everyone give June a warm welcome. We welcome you to our class, June. June, please take a seat. Okay, so today we're going to talk about photosynthesis. Did you know that for a flower to grow, it needs both water and sunlight. Yes. Good. That's good. This is going to be easy then. Earth is made up of lots of biospheres. Who know's what a biosphere is? Kevin. Is it like a place where there are animals and plants, maybe. Good, yes. It's the environment and the organisms that live there. Do you see the picture on the screen? Who can point out the biosphere, when nights are cold, and days are very hot, and the sand blows into dunes. You should do it. - You should do it. - June. Do you know the answer? Why don't you come up here and show us the right picture. So, this is the biosphere that we're looking at, it's the desert. It's very very hot and also very very cold. and it's completely dry. Oh my god, June. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. June. June. June, sweetheart. Where is she? Where is she? - Hey, hey. - June, it's okay. - June, it's okay. It's okay. - June. - No! - Lie down. You know it's her first day of school. She got her first period, she's nine. Yeah. It's all happening so fast, that's all. I didn't think we're going to have this conversation for a long time. How could you've known? Maybe she should stay at home from school for a while. Have you guys thought about home schooling? It's not a bad idea. I could look into it. I should have known then. Aer was stronger than both of us. It's pretty, the way the light reflects through it, isn't it, June? Aery, are you in there? I can't see you. Hey, June. Would you like to learn about your roses? Yeah. So, do you know why we cut off the blooms that are faded? Well, that way the plant doesn't have to put anymore energy into the ones that had died. And it can concentrate on the new stuff, like this one. Can you smell it? That one looks like it had a few more days. I think so, we'll leave it, right? It's so pretty. You know that one's dead, good call. I love that about roses. - They're all different, like people. - That's right. - Do you have a favourite? - Um. What the fuck? Babe, language. My lens broke. June, we appreciate your help. - Don't we, Lily? - We certainly do. June, why did you do that? What just happened? I don't know. Emmanuel said it would. First couple of nights would be the worst, alright? It's going to be okay, baby. It's going to work out. This shall just take a few minutes. It's just to please Mr. Emmanuel. Show him that you're perfectly alright. You are alright, aren't you, baby? Yes. - Lily. - Hi. June. My sweet little girl. I heard so much about you. It's a pleasure to meet you. Come on. She's doing well. I don't... I just-I just think she needs more time. June just need a little help to develop her full potential. She's a very special girl. Very special. I know she is. Okay. I'm sure she's doing well. So, let's do this. Let's work with Dr. Wynstrom, to help June progress a little faster. How would you do that? Well. She can come for a visit, short time, a week or two. I'll work with her, personally. We'll start, Monday. A week? No, I mean... She's just starting to trust me, we're bonding. Things will work out well. And Lily, you'll be in a good place. And little June. Well. She'll become everything a mother would hope for. I understand. Let's do this one last thing. Okay? Trust us. June. Are you ready to go? - Hey. - Hey. Where's June? I don't know. Did you see these? I'm all scribbled out. I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it. I'll talk to her about it. How're you doing, kiddo? You good? So, you know what happened at school? Yeah, I know that was scary. And I'm sorry that we never had that conversation. They happen because I'm bad. No. No, baby. You're not bad. It happens to every young girl. Is it because Aery's bad? Oh, baby. You're perfect. You okay? Wait, you don't want to go that close to the fire. That's why. - Did she burn yours? - Yes, she did. You like that charcoally taste, you go and... You got to-You got to turn it. You got to turn it. - Bring it over here. - Oh, watch it. I think it will fall off. Hi, sweetie. I brought that in for you. Good night. Sleep tight. I'll be in in a little bit, okay? Thanks, babe. - I think this was a good idea. - Oh yeah? Me too. So, um. You worry... about June? No, not really. I guess we can home school her. Not only she gets the special attention she needs, and... most kids couldn't tease her. You know I never lie to you. I was... never sure about this adoption, not after we lost the baby. You mean after I lost the baby. No. It wasn't your fault. These things happen. Just... Maybe this is more than we can handle. You saw what happened at the hospital. She was scared. You saw the drawings. I just... Let me go back, let's talk to Emmanuel, maybe there's... a special program for, you know, kids like her. What do you mean, kids like her? Nothing. Just, she's a little troubled. - I know you see that. - June's not troubled. She's a beautiful little girl who needs a warm loving home. And you and I, we are that home for her. And we're not sending her back. - I never said we're sending her back. - You kind of did. I didn't. Why're you getting so... Oh, hi. It's actually coming down out there, huh. You hear that rain. I think Dave's getting the light out there. I think the campfire went out. You okay? It's okay, sweetie. It's just the rain. It's just the rain. Hey. Hey. June, calm down. June. June. June! No. - June. - Stop, Aery. Stop, Aery. Stop, Aery. STOPPPPP !!! Why don't you go upstairs and change, okay, sweetie. You look tired. Come on. Everything's fine. Everything's not fine. You saw what I saw out there. Jun... June stopped that storm. Are you crazy? You think June did that? I hoped if we kept June happy, Aer would be happy. It's really pretty. June. Can you tell me about Aer. You know I like to meet her. And let her know that we want to take care of you both. Awww! - Oh my god! - What? - My ring. - What did you do? My ring, it fell in the... and the garbage disposal like... I just want... How did it turn on? Dave, your ring is on the windowsill. STOOOPPP !! What are you not telling us about June. I mean, this is not normal? I need to know what's happening. Do you want to bring her in for a psy eval. No, I just... I need to know whats going on. But, it's been less that a week, give her time to adjust. June's been through some pretty traumatic events. Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. Thunder storm stopping and starting, plates falling and crashing and all, what is this? Listen. Listen, Mr. Anderson. I mean other things, past things. Yeah. Like-Like what? Her last home. It was nearly destroyed. She was just getting to know her new family. Oh my god. Is everyone okay? They're fine, everything is fine. If not, I promise you, I can always bring her back into the system. How quickly could something like that happen? I mean... I haven't spoken to Lily, but... I need to know. Our first priority is to protect June. Her welfare is our mission. If she's a danger to herself or to others. I can terminate this adoption immediately. Okay? - Hey. - (Disconnected.) June, I got your glass of milk. You all came from the goddess of turn you shall return. Like drops of rain falling into the ocean. Bodies will fall. And you, Dave, will be the first to die. June! June. What did you just say? June! June! June. Dave! Open this... Let me in. Let me in! Dave, what did you do? Oh, sweetheart. Dave, did you hit her? Did you touch her? I didn't lay a finger on her. Then why did she scream? Why was she on the floor? What the hell happened in her room? Did you hear what she said to me? Did you hit her? You actually think I would hit her. You actually think that I would hit her? What did you do? Lily. You're not listening. It's beyond us. I mean, she... She needs help. She needs more help than we can give her. Maybe we give her to DCF. I mean, they can give her the help that she needs. - No. - Yes. No! We're not putting her back in that horrible system that turns out little monsters. She is a little mon... I can't handle this. I mean. It's not safe, for us. If you can't handle it, Dave. Then maybe you should be the one to leave. You're asking me to leave? Really? Yeah. I need you to leave. Hi, baby. I never wanted it to be like this. But I needed him to be safe. I loved hm. Would you make me wear that? You look like a unicorn now. I'll be right back. Hello. Can't you just give us a few more days. I really think it will help. This is for her welfare. Look, I know you can change this. No. No. I don't understand. Fine, I'll have her there. Monday, 10 AM. I'll be there. See, I told you. This is all your fault. I hate you. I hate you. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. You cannot stop this. June. June. Oh my god, June. June. June, what did you do? She's gone, I made her leave. I made her leave. She's gone. She's gone. Why won't you help me? Why won't you help me, Mama? I can't baby. June. I had a dream, Mama. I did too. It is said that when the blood of the vessels actually shed, the doorway will open releasing the One who will restore nature's order. The One who will bring destruction and release the world. June's time has come. Lily will bring her in. She was chosen as June's guardian, let her fulfill her oath. I don't trust her. She's lost sight of our calling. She's become too attached to the mortal child. Pick up June today. Alright. And take Hughes with you. Where are we going, Mama? Baby. We're getting out of here. No one is available to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. Lily, come on answer the phone. Lily. Answer the answering... Lily, answer the phone. I know you're there, alright. I just went through all of the photos. All the ones I took of you and June. Emmanuel's stalking us, he's stalking June. I need you to lock the doors, I'm coming right now. Can I go to my garden, just 1 more time. Yeah, baby. Just meet me in the car, okay. Damn it. Come on, man! Come on. Fuck. Fuck! Help me! Somebody help me. I'm... Help me. Go. Go, go, go. Lily! Dave. - You okay? - Where's June? Where's June? - Emmanuel took her, come on. - Oh. Come on. Come on! I know where he's taking her. It's on highway 9D. Wait. How do you know this? Just drive, please. I'm sorry, Dave. I should have told you earlier. Told me what? About June. - About Emmanuel. - What about them? Look, I keep seeing Emmanuel in all these photos with you two. What is going on? Lily. You're scaring me. What are you not telling me? My parents were the original occult. I was there, the night when they tried to fuse Aer with June. What does that even mean? Something happened and everybody was killed. What? My parents were killed. And I got away. But, now Emmanuel has found June and somehow he found me again. And he's not going to stop. I'm sorry. Go right. Go right, here. This way. Come, this way. Between the world we made a circle, never ending universal. Between the world we made a circle, never ending universal. We are filled with spirit power, send it down, release the chain. Between the world we made a circle, never ending universal. We are filled with spirit power, send it down, release the chain. Between the world we made a circle, never ending universal. We are filled with spirit power, send it down, release the chain. Between the world we made a circle, never ending universal. We are filled with spirit power, send it down, release the chain. - June! - June! June! Lily, we are the caretakers of the Earth. You cannot stop this. June. We are filled with spirit power, send it down, release the chain. Air, I am. Fire, I am. Water, earth, spirit I am. Air, I am. Fire, I am. Water, earth, spirit I am. Air, I am. Fire, I am. Water, earth, spirit I am. Air, I am. Fire, I am. Water, earth, spirit I am. Air, I am. Fire, I am. Water, earth, spirit I am. June! Dave! No! Dave! Dave. Dave. Dave. June! June, stop it. Listen to me, June. You don't have to do this. I want you home. June. I love you. This all happened because of what we believe. And now we run, not from the ones that will hurt us, but from the one she will hurt.
