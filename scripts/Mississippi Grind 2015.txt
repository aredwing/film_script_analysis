Sneaking a passifying touch by ever so slightly rubbing the nose with the index finger... Hello. Hey Gerry. How's the knee? Ughhh. It's getting there. Good luck. Hey Gerry. That was you on Saturday. Parking ticket. What for? They said the cops... Anyone know the spread on the hawkeyes game? Six points. Gettin' warm out there. It's just weather. What does that mean, "it's just weather?"

Anyway, I knew him up in Detroit... Are you from Detroit? Me? Naww. I'm from all over but I knew Tony Roundtree in Detroit. This guy he loved to play poker but he kept dodging my invitations to play in the casinos. Apparently Tony, he had a little bit of a gambling problem before I met him. You guys know about the disassociated persons list? You have that in Iowa? Okay, well in some states you can put yourself on this list if you're trying to quit gambling, which means that you are legally banned from all casinos in the state... - for life. For life. So you know what I'm talking about, right, makes sense. Right? Well, pfft. Not to Tony. He puts himself on this list to show his girlfriend that he's serious about changing his ways. Well, a couple months go by and... Of course... She dumps him. For a guitar player. It's always a guitar player. It is always a guitar player, isn't it? Why is that? Nice hands. - So he's lonely. - He's depressed. And he starts getting the itch to play poker again. Walks into mgm, "sorry buddy." Goes over to Greek town, "no can do amigo." Motor city, "no dice pal." What does he do? Disguise. Yes! He puts on a disguise. Yeah. Sunglasses, fake mustache, a wig. C'mon. A wig? He walks right through the doors, blows past security, sits down at the poker table and he is in heaven. He is brand... - we didn't have woodford, so sorry about that. But that is our top shelf. It's bulleit bourbon. - Alright. - I'm not paying for his though. Excuse me? Well I said his woodford is on me and that's not a woodford... I'm just kidding. I'm kidding lady. I'm joking. Here c'mon.

I'll tell you what Gerry, never bet on a dog named after a disabled president. I thought it was Teddy. Rollin' Roosevelt? It's a good name. No. No, it was not a good name. Next time you quit when I tell you it's time. I used to know this guy back in Kansas City, Archie Headdy. Never knew when to quit. Oh, yeah, yeah, I think I know where this story is going, but you don't... Hey, listen, listen, Gerry. Okay. Archie, he owed every poker player in town at least three hundred bucks. Minimum. It got to point where he was asking his little nephews for change out of their piggy banks. I see him at O'Hara's poker room one day and I walk over to say hello. I see he's got a handsome pile of chips in front of him, over five grand. Archie starts bragging that he started the night with just sixty bucks. Sixty bucks that he borrowed from some new chump by the way. So I pulled him aside and say, "hey, listen. Cash. Out. Now." He's got enough there to pay back everybody he owes and still get a slab at Oklahoma Joes, right? "You're right. You're right." He says, "I'll stop as soon as the blind come throught." - Did he talk like that? - Like a balloon with helium. Yeah. So I feel good about myself, right. I'm smiling, I go back to my table. Think I've done a good deed here. The next thing I hear is Archie's high-pitched screaming voice saying, "I'm all in." And he lost everything right? Of course he lost everything. Yeah. But you know what he says to me? Says, "don't worry, it was just sixty bucks." Some guys are born to lose. You play? Hmm? Pool. You play? Aww, not in a long time. Hey. Hey. Hey. Twenty bucks on my buddy here. - Alright? - What are you doing? I'm gonna watch you play this big winner right here. You said you played. Yeah, but not in a long time. - So you'll lose. - No, you'll lose. No, I'm not gonna lose, I'm spending twenty bucks to watch you watch you make a food of yourself. That's that's not losing. That's entertainment. We gonna play or what? We're gonna play. Oh, we're gonna we're gonna play. You want to be entertained? Fifty bucks let's play for fifty bucks, huh? Hey, hey, hey, Gerry. Play nice now. Okay? Fifty bucks. You like that? Five hundred. Thousand. Let's play for a thousand dollars. That's enough. You fellas don't belong here do you? I'm really, I'm not very good. Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Easy. Easy. We're good. We're good. We're good. What are you doing tomorrow? What are you doing tomorrow? Aww, I think it's Machu Picchu time for me. Time, time for me to hit the road. Oh, okay. Okay, well, it was great to meet you. You too, ger. Hey, do you want a ride some place. Naw, I'm gonna steal a bike. Hey. Hey. Can you, uhh, you got a light? Uhh, no. What's that for? Give me the money. I don't have any money. Bull shit. Thousand dollar bets? Yeah, I heard you back there. - No, no. - Just give it to me. Hey, I told ya, I don't have any money. Okay, I lost it all on rollin Roosevelt. - Don't make me cut you. - Take it easy, buddy. Okay. Take it easy. I'm gonna show you. Hurry up. Here, here, here. See, I don't have any money. What? Do I look stupid? Ahhh! Damnit. Damnit. Shit. Hey you forgot your knife asshole. Heyy. Gerry! Hey! It's great to see you, man. How long has it been? I don't know, a couple months. - Too long. - Mmm. - It's been too long. - Yeah, I know Sam. Have you been avoiding me Gerry? No. No way. Can I bring you something to drink? Uhhh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Oh, forgive me but I got here early. I ordered a salad. Order whatever you want. It's on me. No, it's fine. Yeah, I know it's fine. I insist. Okay, sure. I'll take a burger, medium-rare, fries. Alright. Hey, how are you? You know, same old grind. I would like to retire soon, but doesn't seem to be heading in that direction. How's your real estate? Uhh, slow and low. I'm sure it'll pick up soon. Yeah, eventually. Don't make me ask Gerry. Sooo last night I had eight hundred dollars, I go out into the parking lot, fucking guy robs me. Meth-head with a knife. He stabs me in the gut. See? Oh God, Gerry. Put that down. Honestly. You need to have somebody look at that. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. - I can't imagine. - It was pretty scary. At least you're okay. Yes. Just a scratch. It could have been a lot worse you know? Mm. Gotta take it. Hey. Awgh. Jesus. Lord. No. I'm not bringing it to the school. I'm in a meeting. Ask you dad. I don't know where it is. Well you know it's not my fault that you forgot it. Teenagers. Hey. Okay. I will. I'm I'm gonna bring it. This is the last time though. Alright baby I'll be there in half an hour. Do not keep me waiting out front. You are so lucky you don't have to deal with that shit. Gerry, I tell ya. Huhh. So, what do you have for me today. It's about eighty dollars. I had the rest... - Meth-head. - Fucking meth-head. - Dead beat. - The worst. - Things will look up. - They always do. Well, not always. Couple weeks. Couple of weeks. Don't worry about it. - Tomorrow. - Mmn- tomorrow. Gerry, I'll send Ted to drop you a visit. Oh, no no there's no need to bring him into all this. Couple of days I'll have a commission and... - Get it together. - I had the money. - Yeah. - This time is wasn't my fault. I understand. Take care. - Gerry. - Heyyy. Curtis, I know you're probably half way to New Orleans... Crazy day, Gerry! I ended up in Chicago. I w-won a ticket to the bulls game shootin' dice this mornin' so I went. Now I'm back in your neck of the woods. You are? Where? Same uh, same place we met the other night. No. Gerry. Gerry, would you be so fine as to order me a woodford? A woodford. Two woodfords! You ever seen an NBA game up close? Those guys are tall. Hey man. - It's a sign. - What is? It's a sign. You walking in the door when I'm calling you on the telephone is a sign. I'm telling you it's a sign. Alright. Okay, look what happened to me after you left last night. What is that? In the parking lot, some guy cut me. Are you okay? It's not, it's not, s-so serious. Did you know the guy? Yeah, yeah, I knew him, yeah, w-we played some softball on the weekends... That's a fair question. - No it's not a... - Does that hurt? - He was mugging... - That's gotta hurt like hell. It stings a little bit but what I'm getting at... Shhhhh. Hey, Curtis what I'm trying to get at here is that good things happen when you're around and when you're gone. When you leave... - you get stabbed. Yeah. I've been thinking. You know that home game, New Orleans, dissasociated guy. - Tony Roundtree. - Boom. I want in. That game has a twenty-five thousand dollar buy-in, Gerry. - Which is a lot. - Yup. - I got a plan. - I'm listening. We go down the Mississippi. Okay. Yeah, we go, down the Mississippi. Like huck-fuckin'-fin and Jim... On a raft? No, we take my car. Okay. Okay, but we hit up all the action. Everything along the way. Cause I know some weekly home games. Yeah. - Casinos. - Sure. Then we got the gambling towns. Memphis Tennessee. Tunica. Absolutely, Tunica. Now, I'm gonna be straight with you. I'm in a little bit of a hole right now, but I'm working my way back out so all I need is for you to stake me fife hundred out the gate-hey, look. It's not it's not, I-it's an investment. Okay because I'll play, you'll be my lucky charm. We split the winnings even-Stevens. - What about your job? - They won't miss me. Can I ask you a personal question? Uhh, yeah. How much do you owe? A lot. To who? Everyone. I'll stake you two thousand dollars. Your car, my cash. Hot damn. That's what I'm talkin' about. - That's what I'm talking about. - Come here. Easy. Easy with that. Oh shit. Wish me luck. Heyyyy. - Let's go! - Go, go, go, go. Is everything okay? Tony Roundtree he, he once had a pet tiger. Won it playing baccarat with an Arab prince. Cleans the guy out, the prince wants to keep playing so he puts his tiger on the table-not literally but... Yeah. Yeah, you know jokes on Tony, though. Didn't' know he'd be hemorrhaging money on this thing. He's got to register it with the federal government, get a special permit. First time I met him was on a on a bar car on an amtrack train from Denver to Albuquerque and remember he was wearing this blue velvet smoking jacket and drank from a copper flask. And the tiger? It was tranquilized. Checked with the other cargo. He checked a tiger on an amtrack train? Apparently, they have a policy. Hey. Hey. You wan-you wanna know what it costs to check a six-hundred pound animal? Yeah. Yeah. Hold on a sec, wh-what-what are we listening to here? Oh, this? Two-hundred poker tells by Joe Navarro. - Are you serious? - Yeah. How, how often do you listen to this Gerry? Whenever I drive. Are you gonna make me listen to this the whole way to New Orleans? We don't have to listen to it. Hey there Gerry. Missed you at the office today, hope everything's okay. Umm, anyway, it's all a bit awkward but I feel I need to mention some of the petty cash seems to have gone missing. Not that I'm accusing you of taking it but Jenna says that when she left last night there was over two-hundred in the box. Also, a friend of yours named Tim stopped by, said he's looking for ya. ...Fear. These soft areas will quiver or twitch, revealing the persons negative, emotional state.

It was one of these old, umm, you know these, rotary blade, that you push it. And my little sister she jumps out and she's, uhh, well she's screwing around making fun of me, or whatever, you know like little kids do. And she won't move so I give her to the count of three. Fair warning. I thought so. But one, two, three goes by and she doesn't move. So I ran over her foot. She lost three toes. But what about your toe? My grandfather's brilliant idea of justice. This morning my ex-wife caught me stealing from her sock drawer. Not the first time. Purple sock. Same sock she had when we were married... I'm not a good person. I'm not. I don't deserve you.
