I'm gonna go to the police. Mr. Hur, that won't solve anything. You'll still need the muscle if you're gonna maintain the casino. Don't I know that? But how could they mess up their partner like this? Look at this! Just look at this bruise! He's not the only gangster in town, and I'm to blame for getting in bed with you. Shit, putting me in an awkward position why did he do it? I was damn sure right then. We've known each other for a long time, so I didn't think much of it, but I didn't realize how big a criminal he was. Say hello. This is prosecutor Jo. - Mr. Prosecutor. - Petty gangster. Answer me with yes or no to my questions. Got that? Yes. - Can you write? - Yes. Write down your involvement in kidnapping, and assaulting of Hur Sam-sik, and every crime you committed in your life, in clean, legible letters. When and why you became a gangster and how you became the boss Mr. Prosecutor, I, I think there's a misunderstanding, but I'm not a gangster, you hear? Do I look like a violent gangster? I was a civil servant, a respectable one at that. - Open it. - Yes, sir. Huh? For what? What are you doing? Fucking shit! Civil servant? Motherfucker! If you forget something I know about, or lie in your confession even in the slightest, I'll leave the rest to your imagination. Done. March 1982, Busan Customs Office There's really nothing inside.

Ik-hyun, as you may have heard, one of us from Inspection Department should receive the noose as well. Then who'll get it? For everyone's sake, I wish I could do it myself, but I'm the chief, it may cause problems upstairs by doing so So I thought we'd choose by least amount of family members. What do you think? How many kids you got? I got 3 sons and 2 daughters. Ik-hyun, what about you? I got 2 daughters and a son. But I got 2 young unwed sisters. Then you can count in my grand folks, Let's just drink for now. Come on, raise your glass. - Let's drink. - Yeah, drink! I know this is dirty business, but just give him 20 grand, that's the only way for you. His neck is on the line too, why would he accept it at this time? So you gotta be coy about it. Why don't you look into his brother, I heard his surgery bill's astronomical. Make sure it's enough to stuff his fat ass with it. another 5 for the transfer, now what?

This is fucking nuts Those bastards. Supervisor Jang, why is this a problem? Who in the world will claim that he's the owner of 10kg heroin? But what if, who knows what will happen? Mr. Jang, seriously! We have to do this. Then I'll wrap the noose around my neck with my hands. Seriously? No, no. It's a terrible idea. Okay, let's be completely frank about this. What's so wrong about selling some dope to the Japs? I mean, really. How many years were we slaves to those fucking monkeys? Huh? How many? About 30 years. Honestly, it would be disservice NOT to export this, let them get high and fuck themselves up, I wish they'd all die, frankly. This is patriotism! We've to rise above Japan somehow, right? Am I right? I agree with you. Then how about I know a gangster who has ties with yakuza. Ah, really? No, no, no. This really is a bad idea Come. It's been a while.

Hyung-bae, I see you taking those pills, what are they for? Are you sick? It's just painkillers. My leg's busted. Got hurt in a fight? It's not that. I was sent to the Samchung Prison Camp.

Hot-blooded men like me should be in the military! Life's fucked! Fucked!! Careful, it's hot. It's fresh. Sweetie, you're embarrassing me Very fresh. October 14, 1990, Busan Prosecutor's Office First of all, I'll start with a brief on Choi's arrest. On May 5th, 1990, 2PM, Busan hotelier Hur Sam-sik was kidnapped and assaulted by Kim Pan-ho's men at a Dongbang Hotel room without reason and provocation. Hur then accused Choi as the perpetrator, and confessed about his involvement in hotel casinos and other gambling joints. Busan Prosecutor's Office announced their intention to press charges against Choi Ik-hyun for ordering the assault. The prosecution is also in search of the gang leader Kim Pan-ho, who carried out the assault. Reporter Kim has that story. How many are staking out at his girl's place? We have 3 undercover men there. Mr. Choi. How are you holding up? Let me make one call. Well It's Choi Ik-hyun. Prosecutor Jo, come say hello. This is chief prosecutor Choi, from Seoul Prosecutor's Office, Good afternoon, I am Jo Bum-suk. Prosecutor Jo, I know Choi well because he's a Kyung-joo Choi too, and it's true that he's acquainted with some gangs. But your reasoning is that if you know a gangster, you're automatically guilty by association. Excuse me in saying so, but I know the difference at least that much. Then how could you investigate this inadequately? Choi Ik-hyun was a civil official, an appointed figure. Do you know Choi Hyung-bae? You mean the gangster? Yes, the gang boss. That man is Choi Ik-hyun's relative. Did you know that? Is that so? That's what I thought How do you investigate without such vital info? Let's say Choi Ik-hyun is a gangster, then logically he should be associated with Choi Hyung-bae, why'd he side with rival Kim Pan-ho? This is what I'm trying to tell you. I too investigated gangs in my days. My apologies, sir. From what I'm hearing, I think Jo made some grave errors. We'll investigate according to the protocol. Shall we go for lunch? So you're saying you have no ties to Kim Pan-ho, right? Yes, that's what I'm saying. And you had no part in assaulting and threatening Hur. Don't change your story later. Fine, go home for now. But let's get one thing straight. If there is slightest contradiction in your story during my investigation, I'll come after you with everything I got, no one will be able to protect you. Go. April 1985, Busan - Bring me something cold. - Yes, sir. - Bring some juice here! - Yes, how many glasses? Two! Oh hello, Mr. Hur. Wait, look who it is! Manager Choi! What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at the office at this hour? You haven't heard, Mr. Hur. I left the customs office Why did you leave such stable job? People tend to look for vocations that's just right for them. If you got some good business ideas, be sure to let me in on it. Certainly! Good afternoon, boss. Ah, yeah. - Go on now. - Yes, boss. Who are they? You know, they do some chores for me now and then. Busy? Ah, no. Enjoy. Sure thing. This is fresh! By the way, Mr. Choi, this may be inappropriate for me to ask you, but do you know any gangsters? How could they not make any profit, even though it's this crowded on a weekday?! That's what I'm saying. See that guy with mustache? They're the ones I've been telling you. As you can see, this place is doing very well, but at the end of the month, they take out various bullshit expenses, so there's no profit, and I'm putting more money in for maintenance. You're such a fool. And you didn't do anything about it? What am I supposed to do then? Who brought those goons in? Among the investors, there's a woman who owns 40%, she's the one. I think they partnered up with her and siphon the profit. What's your share? Here he comes. That's Kim Pan-ho, the chief manager. That deputy works for him. From what I hear, he's one of the top gangsters in Busan. So they want to pay him off with 20 large that he put in 2 years ago. We're really tight. Pan-ho was one of us. We're the same age as well. Even though he's not with us now, we rose together in the same family. I can't get involved without justification. Yeah? He's that tough? You can't beat him? Daebu, that's not it. Justification is the problem. There are rules even in the gangster world. I can kick his ass no problem though. Ms. Ko, isn't there fresher batch? Bring us those. Yes, sir. The ladies who had that meeting are leaving. Yeah? Excuse me for a moment. Ms. Ko, you became more beautiful. Leaving already? I wasn't sure if the food was to your liking. We had a great meal thanks to you. Is that so? Jong-bin, let me give you some allowance. My gosh, you shouldn't do that! Those pigs ate so much. Sir, you're much too busy. Why are you paying so much attention to those women for? She's the one who took care of the licensing problem you had. Would I feed anyone who'll blow me? Is that right? Hyung-bae, you mentioned justification earlier. You and I are family. Is there more important justification than that? Tell me if I'm wrong about this, am I? What, you're not up for it? Sir, I don't know what you take me for, but I'm an upstanding martial artist! I shouldn't get involved in this line of business. Listen to yourself, just listen. What a selfish bastard! Would you let your child live like you? At the very least, your child should live proudly. Crazy bastard. Welcome. Good afternoon. - It's this room. - Right here? Good afternoon! Welcome, Mr. Hur. Been a while. You got here early. Please sit down. I'm sorry for being late. I'm Choi Ik-hyun, your new partner. - This is Ms. Jung. - Is that right? Mr. Hur told me a lot about you. You're more beautiful than what I've heard. Fine, let me introduce you, this is the chief manager Kim Pan-ho. Nice to meet you. I heard the gist of it, why did you make us come all the way down here for? What a pretty mouth on that pretty face. Alright. Let me get down to the business. From today, I will check the admissions, and daily accounting reports. I hear this place leaks money like a bottomless barrel. How could you run a legit business this way? Secondly, in order to prevent further complications, I want to place one of my men here. Who? This fella right here. He's a competent man with plenty of experience, so he'll be a huge help with your endeavors. What the fuck! I had enough of this bullshit! You've been around much? I don't know who the fuck you are, but I've had enough! Calm down and sit down. Who the fuck are you? Which gang do you belong to? I'm a black belt, sit down. Enough. Can't you see the grown-ups are talking? I'm sorry boss. Hey, mister partner, looks like you're old enough, shouldn't you know when to shut your mouth? Scared? Mister, I don't know where you crawled out of, but you should stop for your sake. Watch your fucking mouth, bitch! - What the fuck! - Are you fucking nuts?! You're done for now. I'll fucking kill you! Hey! Do you know who I am? So this is how you want it? Assholes! You're all finished! Alright, they bit the bait, just go and wait for my call. Bastards. Fuck off! See them making off. Those bastards ganging up Sir, I could of really kicked their asses one-on-one. Hyung-bae, It's all ready for you. Chang-woo Let's go! Fuckers! Assholes! Beat them all! Motherfuckers! Where you going?! Head down! I said head down! What the fuck's going on?! I heard about this today. I know this is your turf, but also my Daebu's business. Isn't it better for me to have his back? Let's do it like this. Let's put half of our guys in the club, and you take care of my guys leaving, with severance pay. Okay, I'll prepare some dough. I'll talk to other owners and get as much as possible. But I can't allow any of your boys here. How can we be under the same roof together? Asswipe, I still got some pride in me. Look at you, already using grown-up words. Look here. I still got pride in me too. I'm almost 40, and got my ass kicked by ignorant thugs, but I'll let it slide since you guys are good friends. I sincerely apologize again for what happened earlier. Is the female owner your bitch? Don't want to look bad in front of her? Watch your mouth, asshole. Asshole? Light this cigarette. Go on. Light it. Woke up on the wrong side of bed today? Hyung-bae. I'm not the same snot-nosed kid who used to light your cig. That's it. Let's get you some bruises. Give me a smoke. 'Resist, resist' withstand the action, synonyms are endured, refuse. It just pours out of your mouth, huh? Do I always have to get angry before you study? Next. Mr. Choi, we need to talk. Haven't I given you all the top positions over to you? And now the bookkeeping too? Do you need anything else? Will you calm down? I found out that the accountant's been stealing quite a bit. I'm gonna shove the shit from your mouth down your throat! What? Who do you think you're fucking around with? Stealing? Who's stealing? You're the one doing it! Fucking bitch, have you gone mad? Did you just hit me, motherfucker?! Fucking asshole! You crazy bitch! Take this, you bitch! Take them all! Get him! I, um, sir I'm a customer here, customer. Hurry up, will you? Slow fucks, come over here. Sit. You seem younger than I am, can you show some respect? Shut your mouth and sit the fuck down! Asshole, watch it! Watch where you put your hand! Where's your chief? Get me chief Kang! Do you know who I am? Do you know how close I am to your chief? Excuse me sir, could you tell me how you know our chief? He lives in Namchun, doesn't he? Yes. You idiots, I had dinner with him last night, and went to the sauna together. We did everything together, you picked the wrong man. Is that so In that case Detective Lee, apologize to him. Now! I'm sorry. Have a good visit, big boss. Big boss' got a visitation! Have a good visit, big boss! I think Pan-ho got his story straight with the owner bitch. Otherwise, how could we get arrested together? Is it looking bad for us? I can take care of myself, but you're the problem. Pan-ho's hurt quite a bit. He's hospitalized for 12 weeks. Why did you have to go that far? Shame on him. How could a gangster press charges over a beat That spineless There are still ways to solve this, so don't worry too much. What have you got in mind? May 1985, Gyeong-ju Choi Clan Gathering Clan Member of the Month: Prosecutor Choi Joo- dong Ah, uncle, you're here! Joo-dong, how have you been? Let me introduce you, I told you about him earlier. This is Choi Ik-hyun, he's one of us. How do you do? My name is Choi Joo-dong. Nice to meet you, prosecutor Choi. Mr. Choi and you are about so, let me see, ah, that's right, so your father my brother's grandfather his brother's grandson is Ik-hyun. Is that so? Yes, sir. Sir, I think my men made a mistake without knowing what's going on. Let me check and call you back. You still don't get it. There's nothing to check again! Chief Kang, the quarrel between Choi and the owner is a business dispute, and Choi Hyung-bae and Kim Pan-ho situation is a separate matter. Don't you understand what I'm saying? You want us to take care of them separately. That's right. And speaking of Choi Hyung-bae, won't it be better to take care of it without charges? They can settle on their own. Alright, please take care of it. Yes, thank you. They won't be any more problems, Daebu, the chief will take care of it. You didn't have to This is As the saying goes, the gold toads are famous for returning the favor. Oh, they sure look loyal alright. It's over now. I shoved a grand for a nice dinner for their trouble, and all of sudden, they are oozing respect. Those crooked bastards Daebu I don't trust people easily. Got backstabbed many times. I was imprisoned 5 times, and it was all due to the people who acted like my brothers. Right, humans are the most cunning animal of all. So I had a huge revelation, there's no one to trust except my family Godammit, Daebu. I feel so confident with you by my side. I love you. Hyung-bae. I want us to surpass our partnership, and become one in mind and body. You got the muscle, I got the brain! We must take this chance to become one and create something big. The stars are lining up just for us! You're right, you're right. May 1987, Busan To wish everyone's bright future and prosperity! Kanpai! Let me formally introduce you. This gentleman lobbied the government for us concerning the hotel we invested in. He's my Daebu. Pleased to meet you. I am Choi Ik-hyun. Nice to meet you. I am Kaneyama Zaidoku. Thank you so much for your help. Expresses his gratitude Please accept this gift. Thank you. Congressman Park is calling for us downstairs. Let's go and get this over with. Ah, you're here! Let me introduce you. This must be chairman Kaneyama, Choi Hyung-bae here heads our party's Youth Movement. What are you doing? Be more respectful to these great men. Do it again. My apologies. He must be nervous for seeing such important men. This is a plaque from the President. For the invaluable contribution to the successful preparation of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, this plaque is awarded. Oh, and please take this souvenir, this is called Hodori, the official Olympics mascot. The gold medal isn't really gold, but this sure is! I apprised the President of your request for the hotel casino, so don't worry. We'll now commence the historic opening ceremony. With cutting of the tape, a new era of Daedong Hotel and Casino will begin! One, two, three! Mr. Choi, you really overdid it! You must've finally hit it big! Pretty? Big time my ass. You can't get rich off just two casinos. Gotta have 20 or so in Seoul to be a big shot. There's no end to a man's greed. Whatever you start, you gotta see it through no matter what. Can't stop until you reach the top. Do you know why? When I was a kid, my family was the richest in town. Tons of land too That was real fresh But in the era of the Liberals, my father ran for a seat in the parliament independently, and lost the election and our fortune, then died of stress. He placed second in the election. Being second is worthless. You don't get shit for placing second. We lived in poverty afterwards, and I grew up rough all because he placed second. Then what place are you in now? Me? Obviously I'm #1 in Busan. Dunno nationally. What about Hyung-bae? Isn't he #1? What are you talking about! Hyung-bae's under me. His only job is to manage his boys. He can't do shit without my permission. Is that right? So you're above him? It's not set in stone, of course, but I guess you could look at it that way. Is it really Fire truck? I don't think so Can't you tell? They're fakes. Don't even look alike. Get off the stage! Bastard Hey you, do you know who I am? Carry on. Hey, supervisor Park! Come over here. Need to talk to you. Talk about what?! Do it later. I need to fucking talk now. Go on. Come here. Ma'am, leave us for a moment. Is that Fire truck? Huh? Is that the fucking Fire truck?! They didn't want to come, what can I do? They're the same, acrobatic and shit. Fucking moron, didn't you say you could get 'em? Buddies and shit! Fuck, they didn't want to come, what am I suppose to do? Then what happened to $15,000? I gave them the whole lot. Fucking liar, stop shitting in my ears. Asshole, I've been hearing shit. What? Heard what? Heard you gave them 2 grand. Then where's remaining 13? Give me half. What the fuck. Be ethical about this. Any business with money involved should be done cleanly. Ah, shit. This mosquito is annoying as fuck. Fucking prick, you think I'm joking around? Get me the money! There is none, motherfucker! You think I'm just playing with you?! I'll roundhouse kick your fucking face. Get me the money if you don't want the beat. Got that? Son of a bitch You know, I'm a taekwondo master! Worthless dumb fuck what did you just say? Say that to my face again. I'll shove your dick up your fucking asshole. Where's your manner? Don't you greet anymore? Afternoon, boss. Piece of shit, are you nuts?! What a fucking day! Fucking day?! Fucking day! That's enough, boss. What do you think you're doing, let go! You're fucking done, you hear?! Wanna die? Keep at it, asshole! Boss, please. - Let go! - Boss, what's with you?! Let my hand go! - Boss! - Let go! What's going on! Boss, you're here. Oh, Hyung-bae, this fucker! Do you know what he did today? You're finished, asshole! Daebu, if there's a problem with the boys, don't act out on your own and tell me. Welcome, boss. - What's this? - Oh, boss. Why is everyone swarmed in here? Haven't heard? Pan-ho and his men are eyeing you and the boss, so we're on full alert. That doesn't make any sense! Why would Pan-ho order a hit on us at this time? It's probably because of the hotel casino, since we're running the hotel in their turf. Idiot. That's not for us to decide. The government tells us what to do.

This is getting better and better. Since the government unofficially permits casino regardless of hotel management, Choi had full control over it.

You are seriously barking up the wrong tree, I could care less if you're a gangster, asshole! When I say you're a gangster, you are one. Keep a straight face, don't you dare muddy the mood. Did it really? You must be having a hard time. It won't look good of me to get involved at this point in time. But I'll look into it. This will blow over, I'm sure. Your kind words are enough to comfort me. Yes, sir. Take care. Tougher than I thought what happened to the boys? Those fuckers Alright, I'll call back later. Call me if something comes up.

Tell him another time. Don't make me fuck you up in front of them. Where do you think you are, you fuck! Alright, alright, calm down! Let go! Sit back down. Let's go talk outside. Have you been busy lately? I know everything. Conspiring with the prosecutor to put me inside? What are you saying? I was interrogated and came out yesterday. Sucking everything for what it's worth, should I make you a cripple? Hyung-bae, you got it wrong! As you know, this investigation was initiated by the President. Why would I want you locked up? Shut your fucking trap! If I instigated this, why is Pan-ho locked up then? You gotta think logically here. Let's get through this together. We have to help each other. Fuck, I'm being fooled again It's true I pretended to be on his side to ease his mind. Gotta buy some time, ain't it? I really don't know what to do Prosecutors are kings now. So, what's your plan?

Yes, you did. Then let me ask you this. I like to think that I tried my best to help you, did any of it make a difference? You've been helpful. Then how could you do this to me? You sided with Pan-ho in the first place! I clearly told you that's not what happened. What do you take me for? Why would I order a hit on family? That's not what I meant, you didn't side with me and went to him, and made me look like a fucking pussy, isn't that it? In any case, this is the end for us. I know you'll look out for yourself, but be careful. Move! - Back up for him. - Sure, boss. What the hell? We're blocked from both sides, eh? What do we do? Everyone standby. Move!
