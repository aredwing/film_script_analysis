And we got us a big old house with lots of trees... ...and there's a sprinkler on the lawn. And I'm swinging in a hammock... ...just drifting off on a Sunday afternoon. And you're sitting on a blanket in the grass... ...drinking the coolest, sweetest, ice-cold glass of limeade. Not that powdered shit they sell in cans. No. Real limeade. Fresh squeezed. With real sugar and loaded with ice cubes. And we got us a little boy between us. He's just about the most special little boy this world's ever seen. And there's big old puffy clouds in the sky. We got nowhere to go. Nothing to do. We're just sitting there, talking about silly things. About good times gone by. Remembering all the places we've been... ...and drawing up a list of all the places we're gonna go. I wanna go to Hawaii. I wanna walk along the beach. Drink pia coladas. You'd be the prettiest girl on that beach. No doubt. Duke, let's get married. We're going to. - Do you mean it? - Of course I do. When? Just as soon as we can get a little ahead. - I love you, Duke. - I love you too. That's 19.22. Fifteen, 16, 17, 18, 19. Take that off, please. Stay there. - What are you looking at? - My fiance's bicycle. No way, man. I got that thing behind K-Mart. - You say it's yours? - I said it's my fiance's. Go ahead and take it. It's locked. Ah, man. Anyone got a key? Ricky's got the key. He's down in Barstow. Sorry, homey. Can't help you here. You were in our place again. You need to learn to respect your neighbors, my friend. That's how you show me respect? Calling me a thief? And a liar? - I just want the bike back. - No problem. Come get it. Oh, my God, what happened? - Nothing. - Baby, there's glass in it. Go sit down. - Go on. - I'm fine. Go sit down. So you went down there, didn't you? I saw your bike chained up outside. What did you want me to do? Oh, shit. Hold still. - Does it hurt? - No. Did you pick up work today? - Half day. - Don't they need you back? I got a interview tomorrow. Office job. - Really? - Yeah. Baby, that's great. Why didn't you tell me anything? - I did, as soon as you took a breath. - Yeah, that's funny. Imagine me, office job. So you're not gonna tell them you're on parole, right? I'm not gonna tell them unless they ask. But if they ask, I gotta tell them. You know, the landlord called about rent again. Oh, great. Well, did you tell him we were robbed again? Yes. And he said he still has to pay the bank. Well, how about he pays for fucking security? Don't yell at me now, Duke, please. Look, babe, I'm sorry. I mean, I'm just frustrated. I never even used that old bike anyway. - That's not the point. - Let it go, Duke, please. We have enough ugly in our lives. You never wished me happy birthday. Oh, babe. I'm sorry. Happy birthday. Hey, come on, don't do that. I hate it when you do that. Things are gonna be okay. We're gonna have that little house... ...with the hammock and the grass and all the rest, okay? How, Duke? How is that ever gonna happen? I know it's hard to see sometimes. You know what it's like? It's like we're standing on the bank of a river. If we could just get to the other side, things will be okay, you know? And we will. We will. You remembered? Duke, this is beautiful. Happy birthday. Oh, my God. Try it on. Let's see. - Wait a minute. We can't afford this. - It was my mom's. Oh, my God. There are times, I swear... ...times when it all goes away. Wrangle me up some fries, hang them on the side of my car door? You want chili cheese with those? - How's your ulcer, Eddie? - Like a scab that won't heal, man. Ketchup will do, darling. - Hey, boys. - What's up? Pollen. Jesus, God, man. You place me in good company. Look, the money's close. - Get me out, I'll get it back for you. - Is that right? Come on, Pollen, I'm freezing my balls off here. I imagine that's true. Come on, Pollen, we go way back. You're talking to me about things that are really of no interest. Where is my money? Okay, look, listen, this is not my fault, okay? I took the money to make the buy, like you said. That's what I did. Then these punk kids show up with guns blazing. Took the money and the dope. Ripped me off. Bernie, I wanna believe you, I do. You don't have a great history with the truth. Not this time. I'm telling the truth. Now you are about as jacked up as I have ever seen you. Makes me wonder where you got this stuff because you didn't have cash. Jimmy The Leg. Jimmy The Leg. You could ask him. He did a major score last night. He gave me a little bit this morning, just to, you know, calm my nerves. It didn't take. Give me your hands. My hands? Come on, just offer up your hands. I need you to offer me up your hands. Come on, what are you doing? I just need to be sure. It's just a new polygraph thing I'm working on, kind of old-school. Now, offer me your hands. Get his hands. Hey, hey, hey, Pollen, hey, man. Pollen, Pollen, I swear I'm telling the fucking truth, man. Just calm down, all right? I just wanna be sure, that's all. Now, which one? - What? What are you talking about? - Do you want the right or the left? - I'm telling the truth. - Left or right? - I'm telling you the truth. - Right, or left? - Pollen, don't do this. - Right? - No, no, no. - Oh, man. - Right, right! - Tell us. No, please, no. I'm telling the fucking truth, man. I'm telling you the truth. You know something? I think I believe him. He may be telling the truth. - That's tender. - Don't. Now, where is my money? Hey, what are you doing in here? Get out of here, do you hear me? Come on, get out of here. Come on, leave. Come on, holmes, come on. Let's get out of here. You can't take that. That is my... - Who do you think you are, huh? - I know who you are. Sit your ass down. What's this? - Fine ass. - Take the VCR. See you. They don't give a damn about us. And they're never going to. Duke, come on. How many? Five, maybe six. Guns? Cap guns, cheap shit. Eddie? All set, brother, let's do it. You'd better be here when we get back. Right here. Hey, hey, hey, vatos. Sit down. - Eddie? - Clear. How the fuck do you guys listen to this shit? This can go one of two ways. Fast. That way you can get back to broadening your horizons... ...via the video revolution. Or slow. Which you won't enjoy, but I guarantee you, I will. - Now, where's my fucking money? - Fuck you. There's one in every crowd. Now, I'm trying to be patient here. Who's your lieutenant? You the man? Okay. Where's my money? What money? I ain't got no money. I want you to imagine... ...you're staring into the eyes of the devil himself. And he's very pissed off. Now, where is my fucking money? - There's your fucking money. - Thattaboy. Now, open the bag. - Open it. - Fuck you, homey. We don't have time for this shit, man. No, no, no. We're gonna make sure these sombreros... ...haven't spent any of our money. Don't move. That's my money. Oh, thank God. Where have you been? Get packed. Road clothes, but nice things you don't wanna leave. Because we're not coming back. Hey, Duke. What the hell happened here, Pollen? Everything went exactly according to plan, Hendricks. Yeah. Well, you know, Eddie has certainly looked better. Why don't we concentrate on how we're gonna get that money back... ...in the evidence locker by Monday morning? Otherwise, this bonus we so cleverly orchestrated... ...is gonna blow up in all of our faces. Three days. That's not much time. Did you do that math all by yourself? You boys keep getting smarter and smarter. Why don't we concentrate on finding out... ...where this little maggot is going to burrow himself? Twenty. That's another hundred. There's a hundred in each stack and there's 25 stacks. Plus what we dipped into for the car. We should eat something, babe. No, I'm not hungry. I'm scared. It's not our money. - Not theirs either. - But it's not ours. Listen. Every man has a moment in his life when he needs to make a choice. If he chooses right, it's a moment of glory. It's a good moment. But if he chooses wrong, then it's a moment of regret. That won't go away. I'm not saying I know what's right or wrong in a situation like this. It never happened to me. But I do believe that you and me deserve a little bit of luck for a change. Come on, Pollen. Come on, man. Shit. Hey, Bernie. What did I do? Bernie, Bernie, Bernie. What am I gonna do with you? Come on. What did I do? I heard gunshots and I took off. I know what you did. I wanna know what you saw. I didn't see shit. - Shoot him in the arm. - Oh, come on. Come on, guys. - Please don't do this. - An eye for an eye. - Come on. - Deep breath. Good morning. What time is it? I guess almost 10. Where are we? We're about to cross out of Arizona. Got a chance to be in Texas for dinner. - Where are we going, Duke? - Far away. I got something, boss. You made me very happy. - Cute couple. - She's nice. Yeah. Let's hope she's with him. - Hey, beautiful. - So, what's going on with the car? Car's down for a couple days. Fuel pump. Well, let's buy another one. I always wanted a car like this. Well, what are we gonna do? We are gonna get a nice hotel room... ...rent a car... ...and then find a place to have a real wedding. What? Let's get married. - Married? - Married. Love bears all things... ...believes all things... ...hopes all things, endures all things. Love suffers long and is kind. Love does not rejoice in inequity, but rejoices in the truth. Love never fails. In the soul of man lies faith, hope and love. The greatest of these is love. May I have the rings? We forgot the rings. - Is that okay? - It's not what's on your finger, son. It's what's in your heart. By the power vested in me by the state of New Mexico... ...and the Lord God above... ...I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. - I love you. - I love you. - Thank you. - Thanks. Thank you. Come on. Guy's an Army vet. Did a tour of Iraq. Honorable discharge. Had a little trouble adapting when he got back. Three to five for assaulting a federal officer. Walked after two for good behavior. DMV says they bought a car with cash last night. - Property marked the bills. - And? Guy who sold it said they had a couple suitcases... ...got on the freeway headed east. It's a bright orange '57 Chevy. A bright orange '57 Chevy? We'll never find them now. We're never going back. - Never? - Never ever. Then where? Where love takes us. - Wow, Duke, that is so... - Romantic. - Lame. - I know. Champagne, wife? I like it when you call me wife. I'd like to make a cheers. - To what? - To our new home. And new life. - That's really sweet. Cheers. - Cheers. Champagne's good. Do you really think we're gonna get a new life with this money, Duke? I know we will. Things are different from here on out, okay? I promise. Okay. Luck has a way of finding a man with money in his pocket. All right, baby. - That's for you. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Cheers, wife. - Cheers. Cheers, husband. - Let's do something. - We are doing something. No, I mean something special. Something you always wanted to do. You mean it? - You let me win. - No, I didn't. - Do you swear? - I swear. But I've never beat you at anything before. Well, I guess you just didn't know you could. - Let's get something to eat. - Okay. What do you want? - Cotton candy. - Cotton candy? Could we have two cotton candies? - How much? - A dollar. A dollar? Here you go. Keep the change. Yeah, I know it may not look like much now... ...but six months, a year from now, this will be a veritable paradise. We're gonna have green grass, big old trees. You know, we're very family friendly here. You got any kidlets? Someday. Well, when you do decide to procreate... ...this will be the place you wanna be. And of course now here, you got the Jubilee. You got a custom kitchen with marble counters. Comes with a spa out back and three bedrooms and two baths. And then of course you get a list of materials... ...that your builder can use to customize yours. Wanna check out the hot tub? - You kids married? - Just. Well, that's the best time, right after. When they're still willing. Well, you are a lucky man. She is one hot tamale. So if you ask me, dollar for dollar, that, that is quite a value. We could get those curtains with the sunflowers on them. - You like them? - Of course you can customize... ...anything you'd like to your personal taste. - Duke, I really like it. - You do? - She really likes it. - All right. So, what sort of financing you looking into? We're gonna pay cash. Is there some kind of problem with that? Look, just trust me, okay? You wanna fill out a application form. - And I happen to have one, okay? - No, no, no. We wanna buy something outright, in the low-100's... ...like it says on your sign out front. That is a base price. That doesn't cover the extras. All right, well, tell me about the extras. Little lady, would you do me a favor? Why don't you check out kitchen styles in the book under the table? - You'll find the extras. - Okay. How much more for extras? I mean, what are we talking? Amber. Will you please step outside for a second? Duke. Me and this gentleman have something to talk about. That's my wife you're looking at. Well, you're one of them jealous guys, ain't you? Let me tell you something, son... - What happened? - Nothing. Let's go. You sure you don't want me to go? No, that's okay. I'm just gonna get some Tums. I'm still kind of queasy. Okay? - You sure you're not mad at me? - I promise. - I don't mind driving you. - No, you stay here and get some rest. I don't want my husband falling asleep on our honeymoon night. Be back before you know it. - Promise? - Promise. All right. Now, look at her. Isn't she fine? Isn't she beautiful? She is beautiful. And so are you. Oh, thank you. And I still want you to call me... ...the minute the doctor finishes his checkup. - Bye. - Say, "Bye, Daddy. " - Bye-bye, Daddy. - Good girl. Coming. - Hello again. - Good morning. - Come on in. - Thank you. - Another celebration? - A really special one. - Where should I put it? - Just leave it right here. - Okay. - I'll be right back. - Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. Hey, babe. So I got one of everything on the breakfast menu. - You get crispy bacon? - And crispy bacon. And, baby, I got something to tell you. - Where did you put the duffel? - It's right... - Did you move it? - No. - Shit. What did he look like? - Who? - The guy who brought the food. - It was the same guy as yesterday. Shit. Look, get dressed and pack our things. - What did I do? - Nothing. Just do it, okay? - We gotta go now. - Duke. I love you. - I love you too, okay? - Okay, I'm sorry. - We gotta go. Okay? - Okay. - Just be careful. - I'll be back. - Excuse me, miss. - Hi. I just ordered room service and I'm on the 10th floor. I forgot to give my waiter a tip. Is he here? - Tenth floor? I'm not sure. - Red-haired kid? That's Steve. I just saw him in the kitchen a minute ago. - Back there? - Yeah. Bet that hurts. Now, where is my money? Where is your dickhead boyfriend? I don't know. I don't know. She's got a nice ass. Come on. Where is my fucking money? Get off me! What? He's gone. - Gone? - Yeah. He left me and took your money. He's no good. You believe this fucking bitch? Now, why would he leave a fine piece of ass like you, huh? Because I'm pregnant, you asshole! Fuck! Ain't this grand? Ain't this just my fucking lucky day? Well, it's the woman's station in life. It's the shitty way of it. Nothing new. It'll all be over soon, honey. Now, just tell me where you think he went, huh? Where did he go? Jesus. Fuck! Up there. Check this floor. Tenth-floor stairwell. Get some men above me. Shit. Fucking bitch. Fuck, where is she? You don't understand. He's trying to kill me. Amber? Amber! - They're trying to kill me. - Listen, you need to... Hey. Sam Pollen, DEA. Step away from the girl. No. He's not the police. That woman is wanted in connection... ...with a drug-related murder in California. We just tried to take her away, she went ape shit. Look at my face. Can I see that ID again? You don't wanna do that. We've got procedures. Well, I'm well beyond giving a fuck about procedures. Are you gonna show me that ID? Now... Come on! Get your ass back upstairs. Did you hear me, bitch? Move your ass. I'm not going back in that room. You're gonna have to kill me here. Duke! Oh, my God. Oh, baby, you scared me. Are you okay? Tell me what happened. Who did this? - He's a cop. - A cop? - What do you mean, a cop? - And he wants the money. Baby, come on, we gotta go. Baby, come on. Are you okay? Fuck. We gotta go. You and your stupid procedure. Jeez. Fucking... - Freeze, right there! - Whoa, easy, easy, easy. Drug Enforcement Agency. Got it? We're looking for two suspects. Male, Caucasian, mid-20s, brown hair, blue eyes. The female is 5'5", They're both wanted for murder in California. They're both armed and dangerous. One of them just popped this guy. So, what are we gonna do? I don't know yet. Come on. Ma'am, today is your lucky day. Baby, we gotta go. I don't know if I can do this. Sure you can. You're gonna walk right through that lobby and right to the car. - You're not going with me? - They're looking for us together, okay? We have a better chance of getting out of here if we split up. You're just gonna walk right to the car and come around back, pick me up. I promise I'll never leave you again. We gotta go. - Wait. - What? I'm pregnant. - What? - I'm pregnant. - You're pregnant? - Yeah. We're gonna have a baby? Come here. Oh, my God, this is the best day of my life. Wow, how long have you known? Well, for sure, since I got back last night. Oh, man. - We can't die now, Duke. - We're not gonna die. But we're gonna have one hell of a story to tell. Hey, we're looking for a young couple, mid-20s. Shit! Fucking motherfucking bitch. You! Come on! Come on. Got some ID? It's out in my car. What happened here? Couple of Bonnie-and-Clyde types shot a casino employee upstairs. They're wanted for murder in California. Wow, that's bad. Do you need me to get my ID? No, it's okay. Hey. You don't have to put up with that. There's a women's shelter that can help you. Thanks. Next. Did you see a young couple come through here? - The girl's wearing a maid's uniform. - Every maid has been through here. This uniform is about three sizes too big. She's a cute little thing with a black eye. Oh, God. Oh, baby. We made it. Go, go, go. Go, come on! The cop at the casino said we're wanted for murder. I hid the money. Just in case he catches up with us. The money's the only leverage we're gonna have. We gotta get off at this main road. Find a place to hide out for a while. We could stay here till dark. Even if they put a helicopter out, they wouldn't find us here. So once again, the girl pulls out her weapon... ...fires off two shots, just misses me and my partner... ...down goes the hotel security guard. Next thing I know, the dude comes charging in... ...pulls her out, and they're both gone. That's it. - Okay. I think that's it. - Yeah. Look, I know it's been a long day. Appreciate your cooperation, huh? You just hang tight a bit. It matches his earlier statement. I believe it was a good shoot. He's calm as a clam at high tide. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Language, Billy. High tide, a clam is buried, sleeping, not a care in the world. - I grew up on the coast. - Yeah, I still don't see your point. Do you remember when we had that standoff... ...the barricaded guy in Santa Fe? No shot was fired, but you and I both were shaky for three days. I wouldn't say shaky. This guy expels nine rounds on a public stairwell. Bodies, blood scattered everywhere. He's not even asking for a cigarette. - Maybe he doesn't smoke. - He smokes, all right. I read his file. So who are these kids he's implementing? Implicating. Who are these kids he's implicating? These, Billy, are questions you and I will pursue with due diligence. So, what room do you think this is gonna be? Living room. It's gonna be a pretty house. Yeah, it will be. I just felt him. You can't feel him yet, Duke. No, no, I felt him. You're gonna be a great dad. What did you get? I verified that she was a checker in a store... ...in some desert dump called Round Rock. Been there six years, no record. And he was an Iraq War veteran and a parolee. - What did he do? - Assault. Federal marshals were closing this nursing home... ...throwing a bunch of old folks out with typical government tact. His mom was one of them. So she goes into cardiac arrest, he loses his temper. He gets the long end of the stick because the guy he beat up was a fed. Any lawyer with a good haircut would've got him probation. Well, lawyers with good haircuts cost money. Yeah, I know. Something stinks. So I guess we think it's a boy, right? I don't know. Do we? Well, we keep calling him "him. " Yeah, I guess we do, don't we? Maybe we should start thinking of some names for him. Well, what if it's a girl? I think it's a boy. It feels like a boy. Joe. I always liked that name, Joe. That was my daddy's name. You knew. Yeah, I did. This isn't fair, Duke. Yeah, I know. Sometimes it seems that way. We've come this far. We finally have a little one on the way and... Hey. I'm gonna take care of this, okay? I promise. I understand you're gonna stick around for a while. Hopefully only for a couple of days. Just until we find them. Well, our captain's put both choppers out. No sign of them. Feels like maybe they've moved on. Oh, no, they're still around. How can you be so sure? I'm a cop. Seems like you might be a bit of a gambler too. Well, from time to time. Well, we have ourselves a new casino out by the freeway. Indian. Thanks for the tip. Maybe I'll check it out. Can I get you something? No. I don't wanna spoil my lunch. Suit yourself. One more thing. What is it, detective? This couple you know so much about... ...who allegedly shot up a meth gang in California. And a couple of my partners. Ballistics say the slugs came from a weapon... ...confiscated in a DEA drug bust in Palmdale two years ago. Isn't that interesting? Makes you wonder how those weapons got out of DEA lockup. Well, aren't you an inquisitive lady? Not ordinarily. Normally, if I was to hear that a few gangbangers bought it... ...I'd figure, what the hell, good riddance to bad rubbish. But when you learn that things go missing... ...from inside a law-enforcement agency, that just wets my whistle. Because I know someone's gambling in the big leagues... ...crossing the kinds of lines that foul our reputation as lawmen. And generally steals the pride from my life. Drives me fucking crazy. There you go. See, started cursing. And I can't help but start to wonder, do I know any desperate men? The world's full of them. You should get that cut looked at. I think it's infected. In the dream, it's late afternoon... ...and the shadows are growing long across a rich, green lawn. And we got us a big old house with lots of trees... ...and there's a sprinkler on the lawn. And I'm swinging in a hammock... ...just drifting off on a Sunday afternoon. And you're sitting on a blanket in the grass... ...drinking the coolest, sweetest, ice-cold glass of limeade. Not that powdered shit they sell in cans. No. Real limeade. Fresh squeezed, with real sugar and loaded with ice cubes. And we got us a little boy between us. He's just about the most special little boy this world's ever seen. It's a sunny day, and there's big old puffy clouds in the sky. Where is my fucking money? Where is my fucking money? Duke. Wake up. We have to give it back. - What? - The money. Not the money we won, the money from that cop. It's dirty money. There's no good that's ever gonna come from it. Duke. Duke, no, no, please. That's the only way we're ever gonna be free of this. Well, we can't get the money tonight. The cops will still be there. We have to find a place to stay, just for the night. Okay? I'm scared, Duke. Me too, baby. Me too. Yeah, I'm trying to locate one of your agents. Pollen's his name. Yeah, it's an emergency. Yeah? Oh, put him through. That is a proposition that interests me. Hey. Well, that is true. So you're just gonna hand it over... ...and we all walk away and live happily ever after? We'll be happy enough if we never see your face again. You must think I'm the stupidest man on the face of the earth. - You want the money or not? - Oh, I definitely want the money. I just am having a hard time believing... ...that the guy who stole it is just gonna hand it over and walk away. That's what we're offering. All right, then. I'll meet you in a half-hour. I already told you, we're not planning on seeing you again. Don't fuck with me on this, all right? There's an overpass five miles east of town. The money will be there after 7 tonight. No sooner. What, it's not there now? I said, after 7 tonight. A man can see in two miles in any direction on that overpass. I'll know if you're waiting. The guy's a loser, Pollen. I think he just wants out. Are you willing to bet your career on that? I didn't think so. What are we gonna do? He's calling the shots. The dumb son of a bitch doesn't have the money. - What are you talking about? - If he had the money... ...he would've put it out on the bridge before he called. Explains how he got out of the hotel without anybody noticing. He hid the money. Which means he's got to go and get it. Be careful. It must have been him on the phone with Pollen. So it would seem, detective. So it would seem. Well, what the fuck is this? Oh, come on, come on. Don't screw this up. Is that one of ours? Can't be. Fuck! Is everything okay? Yeah. I'm just waiting for my husband. He went across the street to the casino. He's a gambler, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Breaks up a lot of families. Yeah. Fuck! Fucking local yokels. Okay, well, your lights are on. What? Your headlights, they're on. That's why I stopped. Well, thank you. I'll turn them off. - You have a nice day, okay? - Thank you. Just get back in your car. There you go. Keep on moving. What do you make of that? Dumb son of a bitch lost the money. - The money's gone. - What do you mean it's gone? I mean it's gone. Like somebody took it. I don't know who. Who would have seen you go into the bushes? - I don't know, Amber. I don't know. - Shit. Why doesn't he just arrest them? That, my friend, is a curious question. Why don't we just arrest them? Patience, Billy. Patience. He's gonna think we lied. He's gonna come looking for the money. We gotta get out of here. We gotta leave, right now. You're right. What? I'll be right back. Maybe he's not as dumb as I thought he was. I don't know. Those kids don't look so dangerous to me. Me neither. - So, what do you think is going on? - I don't know, Billy. But I don't think our DEA friend is telling us the truth. Number nine is wrong. Are you sure? Fuck. Do you have to curse all the time? - One of them quit. - What? One of the gardeners quit yesterday afternoon. But that doesn't mean he's the guy that would've taken the... It's all we got, Amber. If it isn't this guy, we're gonna have to keep coming back until we find him. It's all we got. So that's it? That's it. Be careful. I will. I'll be right back. You don't wanna be part of this. Come on, man, we could split it. No, we can't. Fifty-fifty. Both go our own way. You're not hearing me. Now give it to me. He leaves her alone in that car another minute... ...I'm gonna finish what I started. It's gotta be something with drugs. These kids don't seem like the druggie type to me. Meth. They got a lot of meth in trailer parks. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Saw it on CSI. - You got kids? - Got four kids. I'm gonna be a dad. You're the first person I told that to. Here. Get your job back at the hotel. This boy's better than a bird dog. Yeah. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Okay. Let's go. We're gonna take them out now? No, let's let them get out a little further. Bingo. So we're done, then, right? We're just gonna leave them what we took and we're gonna keep the rest. - Right? - Yep, that's it, we're done. Once we get rid of that money, we're free. Shit. It's almost 7. We got time. It's only 10 minutes from here. - Sure we're doing the right thing? - Yeah, we're doing the right thing. We're gonna get through this, have some money in our pockets. We're gonna actually have a chance to start something. Something new. Okay. What? Shit. What are we gonna do? We're gonna do what we said we were gonna do. We're gonna drop the money off, and we're gonna be fine. Oh, my God. Think he sees us? I think he knows we're here. All right, let's drive into town, get some help. He's a cop, and we're carrying money he's gonna say we stole. Who do you think they're gonna believe, us or him? All right, let's hit him with this. - Popped the cherry. - What are you doing? - Calling for backup. - Who are we backing up? I've dealt with men like this before. You just can't walk away from them. You have to tell them. And if he doesn't listen... ...I'll have to show him. Otherwise, we're gonna spend the rest of our lives looking over our shoulders. There's no more looking over our shoulders. Not with a baby between us. Okay? Hold on. Damn it! Shit! Damn it! - You okay? - Yeah. - Here. - Thanks. What the fuck? Here. Come on. Come on. Jesus Christ, it's hot as hell. Okay. You think that'll do it? That'll do it. Okay, as soon as we hear them come in... ...you go out around back and get in the car. If I'm not out in 10 minutes, you take the money and go to someplace far. No, I won't. I won't go without you, Duke. Yes, you will. Amber, listen to me. You have to. You stay here in case they decide to double back. Come on out! - I love you. - I love you. Let's do this, kids. Fuck. Over here. At last. Do you know how many gray hairs you've given me... ...over the last three days? I should kill you just for that. There's your money. We were gonna put it right where we said we would. Go on, count it if you want. It's all there. Thank you. Did you talk to anyone about me? Nope. Of course, if you did, I wouldn't know about it until it was too late, right? I give you my word. Your word? Oh, that's good. - That's good. - I never had a problem with you. Those bangers you took up with... ...they're the ones who made our lives hell. I imagine they could. Yeah, they took things from us. Hit my wife. Had no respect for anything good. You took something from me. And there it is. So you're just a young man looking for closure, huh? That's it. I just wanna go. Okay. Come on, come on, come on. You didn't really think it was gonna be that easy? I don't want any trouble. Wouldn't that be nice if there were no more trouble? Take the money. You'll never see us again. I can pretty much guarantee you that. - That you, Gault? - Yeah, here. This one's a wild thing. - Amber? - Thought you might need this. - Amber, are you okay? - Yeah. - Shut up. - Hey, take it easy. Hey, it's me you want, not her. I took your fucking money. I need to be sure you haven't talked to anybody about me. I'm funny that way. Who knows? I might have to kill somebody else. Why don't you hang her up over there... ...and then keep an eye on him? - Good idea. - Got him? - Got him. What I've learned in my years of experience... ...the best way to get the truth out of a man... ...is to first torture his woman right in front of him. No! Duke! Looks like it's just you and me, princess. I've missed you. I know how much you love to play rough. Hey! Leave her alone. Backup! Ambulance! Call now! I'm so sick of you! You little pain in the ass, where the hell are you? Where are you? You son of a bitch. Come on. - This is what you want? Come on. - Go. Go. Go! Oh, yeah? Get up. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, get over here. Get over here. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Get away from him! Who you trying to kid, girlie? Just drop the gun, bitch. Baby. Look at me. I love you. Baby. You're gonna be okay. I'm sorry. I chose wrong. No. No, don't you say that. You're gonna take care of our boy. No, don't die. - I love you. - I love you. Oh, Duke, no. Don't. It's late afternoon and the shadows are growing... ...three-quarters of the way across the green lawn. And we have a big old house. And it's real quiet. And we all sit together... ...drinking the coolest, sweetest, ice-cold glass of limeade. Not the powdered stuff they sell in cans. Real limeade, squeezed fresh... ...with real sugar and loaded with lots of ice cubes. And your daddy always said we'd have a little boy between us. And I'd say that you'd just about be... ...the most special little boy the world's ever seen. And you know we have nowhere to go. And it's sunny. Big old puffy clouds. And we just sit there, and we'll talk about silly things... ...good times gone by and good times to come.
