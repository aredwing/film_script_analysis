Go, go, let's get over them, because they are scared, let's go! We could have done much more than being satisfied with little... we can do better than this. Definitely. -Your sister is there. -Hi, Lurdes! -My God, you stink! -It's true! No, stop! -Come by my house later. -You can leave it. Do you want some help? No, just leave it. Is your mom home?

Take your hands away from there, boy! What are you doing? -I thought it was... -Oil! If you didn't know that this is oil, better go back home. What do you want to do with this? I will make a juice for you. The SENAI has the pride to invite... Luis lgnacio da Silva, gratuating in the group of 1961 ... to receive his certificate. People, Mr. Egidio sent me to anounce that all of you are free. There are a lot of protests around here, and the boss ordered to close the factory. You are in protest, you can take your stuff and go back home. I didn't know i was protesting, no. Do we have to be protesting? It's better to go, not to get in any trouble. Let's go. This Friday... the Brazilian nation was shaken again... by manifestations of the unsatisfied protesters. Inspired by left doctrines... workers and populars went out on the street, making Sao Paulo... a true show of vandalism. Despite it's trienal plan combining agrarian, fiscal... educational reforms, banking and electoral... the president Joao Goulart still... finds a lot of political resistence... in different sectors of our population. Ziza, Ziza, look your brother is there! Lula, Lula! Lula, come up! What is it? Are you involved in this protests? No, no, i am just following the movement. Do you want to come with me? Hold on. Hold on. Look there! Look there the people, look at the worker there! The people united will never lose again! The people united will never lose again! Close the gates! The movement, comrade! One of ours was killed comrades! Killer! Push him! Wait! Wait for me, Lula! Wait, wait, Lula! You are confusing the things. Lula. Confusing what, Ziza? Those are not the people from your party? Yes... yes... some of them were... but not all of them. And the movement won't lose it's political importance... because of some stupid deeds! I saw what kind of politics that was, the personal was there to break everyhting! Damn it, isn't you who is saying that the dialogue is important? Damn it, did you hear anybody? You have no idea about the exploitation this bourgeois son of a ... Exploitation of what, Ziza? Damn it, was that unfortunate better than us? Did he really need to be thrown form up there? Shit, shit! What face is that? What face is that?! Those 2 unfortunate writhing on the ground don't go out of my head. Is this something you have to think about now, damn it? lula, look at the force of Sao Bernardo! This is the power of Sao Bernardo, my darling... this is what i am talking about, understood? If we will drink everything now, soon there won't be anything left, right? Is it for drinking or for showing off? -Of course it is for showing off! -And then? Here it is. It happens that i have enough money only for one. Society, ha? This one is yours and mine. Freaking boring guy, you, huh? Isn't it for showing off? I am showing off the package, I am showing the package. O, you are showing? Than this is the reason that those women don't stop looking here You know what you are That's because you have a face like somebody just coming from a long trip... This is the truth That is the reason why they are not looking. And look at you! With this striped shirt... he considers himself a Casanova from... from Vila Carioca! Than this is it, huh, look how it's done... look at me, learn from dady how you approach a woman. Go, go, go look. Watch me. Hi. Are you without company? You know what is it? My friend there... He is lonely, and he is a little shy... I wanted to know if you like... A guy from Vila Carioca... That woman is too tall for you... Who is too tall? You can't afford it, a woman of that height... At some point you stuck you head on the breasts of that woman... lh, the dog, son of a bitch you will awake the entire neighbourhood... First, the obligations; after, the fun. Look, Luis... if it will be the other way, your life won't be long, no. Go to sleep, go... -Good night, mom. -Good night. Another extraordinarily report. Today, in this 9 of april of year 1964... the newly appointed president Castelo Branco... finishes to sign an institutional act... that guarantees to the brazilian govern broad powers... to modify our Constitution... revoke legislative mandates... suspend political rights... compolsorily retire citizens who attempt... against the national security... also other measures that are necessary. The piece is ready. Let's go sleep, Luis. No, i promised You are crazy... To promise something like this? I am leaving. Lula! Lula... what happened? What happened? Luis, Luis... What is it, my son? What is with the hand? Sorrounded by the wave of mass demissions... the ABC workers are marked by bad news in the media... about from two to three months of unemployment per year. Attention, people! There are no vacancies for this function. All the places are occupied, there are no vacancies. Everything is full, finished. -Hi, mom. -Hi, son. Take. Take it, my son. Come on eat, eat my sweetheart, eat. My son, the worst is behind now. Now raise your head, and look forward and persist. It is all about persisting. Welcome. Excuse me... and thank you. And when... when do I start? Start on Monday. How beautiful is Lurdes! I can't stop looking at her. This never happened with me before, i don't know what got into me! If you don't know, i will tell you: it's called love! -No, it's nothing like this... -Love! It's obvious it is! I can see little hearts shining around you... Oh, it's impossible to talk to you. I see Lurdes every day, i never felt anything. Don't try to lie to me, no. Oh! Tell this to my mom. You wanna know? Do something about it at once... go talk to her, go, go, go make the things right. Go, do it, go, go. Be brave, man... You know Lurdes since she was little, go, go fast. Oh, just one more thing, ok? Make my sister happy, man! I am shaking badly... Me too... But mine wasn't yesterday, nor the day before yesterday, you know? When i saw you today, entering here... arriving here to dances, I... started sweating... Really? No. It's a lie. Actually, there is some time since i keep an eye on you... But I keep an eye on you too! -No, it's me who keeps an eye on you. -No, it's me... No, it's me who... Wanna dance? Will some things change between us, Lurdes? Only the good part. It will improve. What a shork, you scared me idiot! Scared of what, my love? I don't know, you are different, with that weird hair... It's a wig, silly. A special edition, of the ''National Journal''... Oh, how boring, can't even watch a series anymore! I will warm up the dinner. Everything is already in their hands, what else do they want? I will go help your mom. ...The institutional act Nr 5, through which the brazilian govern... places the National congress in recess... Geraldo, even i gave up trying to take Lula in the sindicate, Geraldao. Tell him what you are telling me... -Nothing. -What? I said that i think that it is better to watch series... than waste time with this nonsense. Series, Geraldao! Series, Geraldao... So you like series, right? And do you really believe this? Look, Geraldao, i have a good job, you know? I have some plans with Lurdes, and i don't want to get in troubles. You know that at some moment you are up and the next you are down. What is this? Are you pressing me, are you? It's not about that, i already told you, it has nothing to do with that. Ok, just listen, you don't lose anything if you will go the to take a look. It won't bite you. You organize these meetings only to talk about holiday period. When the problem is salary, the effort that you do is not the same. But it is true, Comrades. It's one thing at a time... we should start gaining again the trust of the working class in the sindicate. We have to bring the working class here again. I didn't know it would be like that. This looks like football talk. But it's not like that, on a rush, on fluster, no... No, i don't know, no, huh? Ah, come on! You will keep on insiting with this... and they will go turn back to you... And that one know how to play, huh? -He is the president. -...he will piss you off. Will you confront them, will you go there with your bare chest, against the tank Exactly like this. It can get ugly, but we should reatract a little bit now. It is important. It is important for us to retract a little. Reatracting now is not a sight of cowardice, no, it's a sign of courage. We have to persist, comrads, to continue lively... fix our positions. If no... There is space for you, on his sheet. We need to be persistent... True or not? The stuff is filling the mouth of the workers with everything, but... does this circus change anything... or it stays like before? It depends on what the what the players wish. In reality, a worker like us, even operators... none of them was there. Everything was born and grown in the office. And then, why would i get involved in a game like this? That is what is missing there... somebody different. That thinks different. But why don't you call Ziza? We can't call Ziza because Ziza is a comunist... understand? If we call Ziza... the authorities, the employers will be keeping an eye on us. But his formation? He has formation, doesn't it matter? The formation here is deformation for people. The ideology doesn't matter, it is something for your mind. Ok. Lula, will you come to the syndicate with me or no? I don't know... Come, lula. Come, men, come, yeeee! That's how i like it! Fresh blood around here. What? If i had a little house like this one, would you marry me? There is something wrong with your judgment, no? You just finished speaking about the syndicate, and now you speak about marriage... The sydnicate is very dangerous for those that want to have a family, you know? Come here, come here! Listen, this little place... i boght it with the money that i saved from the compensation. Don't joke with me like that, Mr. Luis! Lurdes, do you have any doubt that we were born for each other? No. Will you marry me? Take care, lula, if you die, i will kill you! Will you marry me? Oh, i'll throw the bouquet! Lurdes, Lurdes, my daughter! Listen... Eh... you need patience in the marriage, ok? You know that, right? Brown sugar is sweet but it is not soft, no, huh? I know, Miss Lindu, don't worry, i will take care... of your son very well, ok? Go... throw... throw... throw... Oh, i will throw, huh? lu, how many buttons does this dress have? Fifty, i think. If you don't get an appointment you can get burnt, you know? But i thought that he stays here to talk to people. No, Claudio stays, but he is a person... with a lot of atributions, meetings... Look, let's do like this, tell Claudio... that these are some ideas that i left here... i got them together with the staff that is in the box, ok? Excuse me, i didn't know that the indemnity was a problem. Oh, you'll see, Claudio will help you, ok? I don't want anything from him. Tell him that Lula left these here, ok? These are just some ideas, nothig special... Go, go, Feitosa, you can solve this very well! Ah, what is this! It's true what they are saying that you are only a sheepskin! -Sheepskin? -Sheepskin! Then tell everyone that you want to remove the sheepskin from the syndicate. Tell them, tell them, tell it to everybody! Ah, you think i am your backyard, no, Feitosa? Backyard, no, this is my house, understand? This is my house! And you have to have more respect with all this. -Should I? -You should. You won't be bringing your equipment back in here, no! -Ah, i won't? -No. And with whom will be doing the sheet around here, huh? -With whom? -With whom? You want to know with whom will i be doing the sheet? I want! Oh, with lula! With lula! The fresh blood, is with me. -That one? -Yes, with him? That is what you can offer? Huh, do you have something better to offer? -Forget, Feitosa, forget, ok? -Very well then, you can leave! Go, go away, go, you are very annoying, jealous! He ows me for 2 months. Doesn't pay to the syndicate for 2 months. Everything fine, lula? How are you there? Hi. What happened? I was thinking that we could take advantage... and educate a directorate that would explain to the workers better... this thing about the Guarantee Fund, you know? The benefits... Ok, a directorate for benefits, is that right? Exactly! Damn it, this will be some hard work... True, i wrote it all down, i made a research. Yes? Ah, then you do this... ...you can do it. -Can I? Guess with whom will I have dinner today. With the governator! The workers are united, Lula, let's go! -That's it! -Then i will set this one, ok? Ok, go. What time is it, huh? -Huh? -What time is it? It's not even 10 yet, my love. You started coming very late. I just want to see what will your son... think about his father being involved in these things with the syndicate. Bullshit. Everybody knows that I am in this thing with the sheet only to... What did you just say? This one will be a corinthian! Hello. A half, please. Let's go, Brazil of my heart Let's all go ahead, united, Brazil Save the selection Suddenly that current is going ahead Let's win! Lu? My love, come. Come take a rest. Didn't the doctor send you to take some tests? Don't worry. He says that this weakness is normal during pregnancy. But i worry about you, you know? I know, i know. I will lay down. Ok. Let me help you. Opa! What was it? Listen! Can you wait for a minute, please? Look, my wife is sufffering. Can't you see that... ...my wife here, huh? -These are the contractions... calm down, please. Let's go sit there, come. Sit down. They will attend us now. Doctor, look at my wife, she doesn't feel well! You sir will be a dad, that's all. It's not all, doctor, look at her, she is pale! Listen to me, who is the doctor here? Me or you? Your wife will be taken to the surgical center, calm down. Tomorrow you do the following, you go directly to the third floor. No, no, i will stay here with her. No, you will not stay here with her. She will be hospitalized. Go home, come tomorrow and bring the babies clothes with you. No, for God's sake, let us be together. Luis... Luis, i am dying... You are not. You are not, my love, things will get better, you will see. I am just going home, ok? I will take the babies clothes and will come back. I am coming back, my love, i am coming back. Let us work! Please, please! Calm down. Luis! Mr. Luis lnacio da Silva? Sir you have to be strong to listen to what i have to tell you. Your son was born dead. You will need to be even stronger... because your wife died too. My son! Oh, my son! Luis? Oh, Luis, come to eat. -And the dances, was it nice? -I didn't go, mom. Why, my son... I don't have any wish to dance. But go out to meet your friends. It's fine, it's fine. Mom, my head is not fine. I know, my son, i know... Hey, i found this in the pocket of your pants. Tiana says that this is from the syndicate. Yes, it must be the leaflet from the campaign. -But did you get into this, Luis? -But this is no secret for anyone. Ah, nor it's not a spoken subject? Look, Luis, this is dangerous! Look, mom, I am the candidate for director. Oh my God, what is this about, huh? I need to keep my head busy. If no, i will go crazy. That's true. But take care not only of your head, take care of this one here, ok? It all happened so fast, no, Lurdes? It was a boy, you know? Goodbye, my love. Sheet 1 , here, comrade... the sheet of the champion... the sheet of the situation here, comreade... it's better in our hands... in the hand of the worker, than in the hand of the cheater, damn it! The sheet of the champion, comrade. Here, oh, the sheet of the champion... Take care, huh? we are too many to be paranoid, Ziza, for God's sake... You know that all your personal from your sheet is friendly to the militars. -What should that mean? -Damn it, Lula, open your eyes! Don't invent, Ziza! This syndicate now is my family too. The first complete vote of the Sheet 1 . Victory, victory, victory... Hey, comrade! Everything's fine? Everyhting's fine? Speak now, president... -And for Feitosa, nothing? -Everything! One more mandate! Speak now, president... I can see that we only have beer drinkers here, huh!? And did we gather here to drink or to speak?! People, on 12th, at 8 in the evening, ok? there at the syndicate. The comrade that doesn't participate is always the last to find out... true or not, huh, comrade? Let's go there, to decide together, so we won't have what to complaint about later, Huh, comrade? That's it, come on. Hey, Geraldao, damn it, they complaint that nobody participates. But then, look at this, damn it, what is it written? Nothing that would say at least something to the simple people! Ah, Lula, you exaggerate, huh? Damn it, they keep on complaining that nobody participates... in the meetings, how will they participate? Nobody knows anything... or i am not right, Feitosa? No, you are not... the people are used to reat the leaflets. But that's the problem. The people are used to, damn it. And what do you want? You want me to do a leaflet... with comic stories? If you want, we ca do them with naked ladies too... That's not funny at all! This is a family syndicate. Miss Margareth is here too. This is no good! Calm down, calm down... Sir... could you turn off the radio? Excuse me, i didn't understand what did you say. Can you turn off the radio, please? Thank you. You're welcome. Because of a woman? That's it, i am never wrong... You look like it's because of a woman... Yes it is. Wife and son. I lost them both. Oh my God. It's less than a year since i lost my son. He was killed in this taxi. they took some change and his life. My grandson... is less than one year old. Only the boy and his mom are left. We help them, you know? But it's so silly... because he won't have a father. True or no? It's true. Look at them... This one is Marisa, my daugther in law... she takes care of him alone... she's a strong woman, she has italian blood, you know? But they still can be happy, you know, Mr....? I am Alvaro, Alvaro, at your disposal... They will be happy, yes... they deserve it... What is your name? It's Luis lnacio, but you can call me Lula. Lula. -Lula. -Ziza... What happened, why this face? -The things are getting serious! -What happened? Two colleagues of mine were caught there in Santo Andre. -The pressure is great now! -Leave it, Ziza! Damn it, leave it, you still don't get it... we won't be able to face the militars. God, against the brazilian army, with a dozen of people! If the workers had the least of conscience... and again you complain about the others, right? What are the chances that this bunch of people will have conscience? But they manage to survive! We need support. -And you are the leader of the syndicate. -The leader of what? Some don't trust me because they consider me a comunist. Others consider that i am too into Feitosa. lider... Didn't you become his pawn, Lula? Ok. Sorry, sorry, sorry... -It's ok... -Are you mad at me? No, nothing like that. I even think that you are right. -One moment, one moment! -Don't one moment me! Feitosa? My board! No board, Feitosa! What is this with belieing me in the bulletin? You can go, Margareth, you can go. Ok? -She is cute, isn't she? -Don't cute me! Then i go there and say that the factory is wrong and you say no? Cleaning the bar of the guys, damn it! But they have to fulfill what they agreed in in their contracts! Do you know what they thought, they thought that we... started the strike, you see! And if you needed to start, Feitosa? If you needed to start!? Are you crazy, men, we are under a military dictatorship! If we start a strike, they put a mouse in a bottle... ...and make you sit on the top! -Don't be a coward, Feitosa! -Be careful how you speak to me, huh?! -Don't take me with that, damn it... You are being weak! We can pass over them, Feitosa! What is it? Are you a truck now, to pass over somebody? There is so much more, see? Am I right, Geraldao? There is, yes, you are from the Metalurgical Union, damn it! Like you didn't know about it... Yes, but now the Union, is going to Maua, Claudio -But there is a way to solve this. -Like what? What do you mean, there is a way? They won't cancel my register. -What do you mean? -They won't dismiss me... nor change my address, understand? Gosh, i don't understand anything! They will forget me here, understand? -But it's against the law, Feitosa, damn it! -Ah, son of a bitch! Against the law? Brazil, Lula! We are in Brazil! My apprentice! No apprentice! Listen... ...listen to me, Feitosa! -Calm down, people, calm down! Somebody needs to start doing the things different here. The situation is like this... you stay until the end of your mandate, after, after you go! Next time, it's Lula who will be the president of the sydicate. -Is this a threat, is it? -No, it's not a threat. Damn it, Feitosa, what did you tell me when you invited me here? That i wanted fresh blood around here. And then. Now it's us, the fresh blood, who will take the lead around here. And, if you don't want the things to get worse than they are... learn to sneak out of here. Let's go. Listen to me! You will become a candidate only with my support, understand? With my support! Sit down, Margareth, it's not for you, no. The employer can not cut down the medical asistance like that. -But the company claims it has this right. -Look, this is actually happening: we are already negotiating with our judicial department. Well... because a company of these dimenssions... and with the quality that it always offered to the workers... it can't just over night... pass the responsibility to the State. Can the operators use other resourses? They can and the have to try to use everything they have at their hand... to gain their rights. Is this the position of the syndicate? Of course it is. -Excuse me, sorry. -Thank you. You can go, i will attend her. Can you please give me your ID, please? -My lord! But you are really a widow? -That's written there, isn't it? So young! But, for God's sake, how did it happen? My husbant was killed in his Taxi. Excuse me, but i am a little in a hurry. Ah, yes, sure. No, my Lord, how is it possible? Look, it will last a while. It's because of this change in the social law, you know? No, because the stamp, the stamp is the endorsment of the entity... for this syndicate, where i am the first secretary. But trust me, i will solve the case. Stamped, ready! Thank you. Listen, would you like to have a cup of coffee? No, i didn't have lunch yet. Great, i am starving. Will you have lunch with me? No. You know, i am impressed. You are very young, you have your entire life ahead of you. Thank you. And where do you live? Me? I live... around here in Eldorado, you know it? -But i live with my mom. -I live with my mom too. You are the daughter in law of Mr. Alvaro, right? You lost your husbant fulishly... and now you are growing your son alone? Are you Lula? Excuse me, but i still can't believe it. We became widowers almost in the same time, you know? My son... If he was alive... he would be the same age as yours. We both live with our moms... it's a big coincidence, no? Will you give me your phone number? Marisa leticia. -Good evening. -Good evening. You must be Marisa's mom, Mrs.... -Mrs. Lais. -Mrs. Lais, right. Pleased to meet you. I am Lula. Lula? -I am Marisa's boyfriend. -Boyfriend? Would You please call her? Because we are a little bit late. Thank you. Good evening. And who do you want to talk to? I am Marisa's friend. And what do you want from her at this hour? -We are going to dance. -Uh, man, she didn't let you know? I wonder what did i have to let Beto know about? That you will go out with your boyfriend. -Didn't I say he said boyfriend? -Yes, I said. Gosh, what are you looking at me like this? Marisa, the dances probably already started! But then go, Beto, before it ends, man. Good luck, man. Pleased to meet you. Now you can leave, ok? But keep it in the shadow. -Complicated woman, huh? -Gosh, Beto! What did you do now? Excuse me. No, really excuse me, just that... its almost difficult to say that... you know, it's not every day that we... every day... moreover, it is once or twice in your life when we can meet someone. And I am very scared that i could lose you, Marisa. -But you just met me. -So, that's why. When someone knows what they want, they have to go search for it. You know, Marisa, I won't lie to you. That's good. I am still young... but i have a son to grow. -I am not here to full around. -No, nor me. You know, you are a very beautiful woman. To be honest, I was never so close... to such a beautiful woman like you are. And nervous! But i like nervous women, you know? Stirs the people. Be careful, huh, Luis lnacio? I am... i am puting myself to risk. It's me who is puting herself to risk. And now the speach of the fiance! Speach! Speach! Speach! Everyone came here today... because we want the best for our category! We are here today to make a change! to make a change! But this doesn't mean... that we have to change the entire team too. Because, to be fair... it's thanks to Claudio, that is present here... the doors of the syndicate were opened. Calm down, people! it's not enought, but it's not enought, and it's logical that its not enought! We know it very well. Everyone here knows that this syndicate needs fresh blood! And everyone here is already with hot blood! Our blood is getting on fire! I know that! You can see that it is possible to get there and to get there... means to sit at the negotiation table with the employers... and look in the face of each one of them who will be sitting in front of us. Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! People... it is important that each one of you sitting here knows... that the workers are not left... and definitely not right. The most important for us... is to provide and take care of our families. So... this directorate is predisposed... to negociate with each employer. it is important that each one of you knows... that here noone, absolutely noone... isn't the enemy of the employers. In the end they are paying our salaries, aren't they? My son, congratulations! May God help you, mu son. Look... go easy on the litter, because the saint is made of clay. Did you understand, huh? Sure, mom. See? Very well! Very well! Here, yes! Let's fill the glasses! Come on, come on! Today, noone stays with an empty glass, huh? -To the new syndicate! -To the new syndicate! Let me see that paper here, let me see. ''Approved in a memorable meeting... with a 6 years fight of our syndicate''... My son, help! My son, help! they took Ziza, my son! they took him! He went to buy bread... and they took him like that... Do something! They say that they will kill my son! They say they will kill him! I will do something about it. go! Go, go, go, go do something! -Are you Luis lnacio? -Yes, it's me. But i want to find out about my brother. I know exactly what you want. -So you don't like this country? -Not the way it is. -And you think you can do better? -Look, I am just a simple worker. Worker, right? And the president of the syndicate is a wrker too? what an insolence. And after that they say that it's not a democratical country. A communist is caught. Another communist comes, his brother, to ask information. is it or no a fucking democracy Listen, fist of all I am not a communist. Second is that the family has the right to know... where my brother Jose is. He... and you... have some luck. They almost broke my brother in half. Ziza didn't do any harm to anyone. You know what i wonder? I wonder what is the logic? Damn it, he works since he was 10 years old. What was this cowardice for, can you tell me? But what can you do? I don't know. But it's getting more and more difficult to separte the things. Soon, except the salary... the workers will want freedom too. You will see. The fact is that, for a banch of sociologs... you are only designers of the club! Let me see. Look at this, Lula. Oh, no, damn it, you are crazy! It's one thing to do a salarial campaing inside the syndicate. But to convoke the workers is something else. This is against the law, Lula! it's an insult to the govern! Arnaldo is right. Listen, people, I am the representative of the workers... not of those who are making the laws. The repression will fall heavily on us. This will end up in chains. So what? Chains were made for men! it is important that everyone knows that this is not a recreational guild. We are leading the syndicate of the metallurgical workers. Let's go guys, let's go! Don't be affraid to get arrested! The chains were made for people! We are living all of this toghether, damn it. Let's go, comrades, the fight is of all of us, right? For a better salary! -But where did it start? -At the sqeezers and on the lathes, my brother. How many are not working in general? The entire factory! What do you expect, my brother? Today not even the wheelbarrow of the line came out. Look, it is important... for everyone to know that we are puting our hand in the vespiary! Everybody has to be aware of this. Lula? -What did he die of? -I don't know. I think because of the alchohol, no? He was burried in a pauper there in Santos. It's ok, no problem. I don't have anything in common with him. Actually, i have, i have, yes. Because... i inherited the kindness from my mother... but all the malice is from him. Aristides died. God rest his soul, right, my son? The things are ugly out there, right, my son? No, not yet, mom? But it can get. We are going now to the stadium of Vila Euclides. Who will be playing there today? No, there won't be any game, no, mom. We will have a meeting of the syndicate there. For God's sake, my son... take care! We know what we are doing, mom. Ai, Jesus. Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! Lula! The united workers will never be defeated... Comrades... there is one important thing: Everything that i will be saying should be passed ... from the people in front to those behind. Pass it behind. So that everyone that is here can hear... otherwise we won't manage anything. The problem is... The problem is... They consider us fools! They consider us fools! They think that we don't read! They think that we don't read! -That we don't inform ourselves! -That we don't inform ourselves! But they are very wrong! But they are very wrong! They... don't want to give anything! They don't want to give anything! -Nothing! -Nothing! They want us to work more and more! They want us to work more and more! They want us to negotiate! They want us to negotiate! And we will negotiate! But how will we negotiate? But how will we negotiate? How, i am asking, how... will we negotiate, comrades? -By stopping! -By stopping! We will negotiate by stopping! Strike! Strike! Strike! Now i want to ask each one of you that is here... raise your hand. So that they understand once and for all... that the decision isn't Lula's, but of the workers of ABC! another thing is important... outside there are a lot of policemen. outside there are a lot of policemen. Soon we will be going home. Soon we will be going home. it's important that nobody... absolutely nobody, let's himself provoked! it's important that nobody... We have to remember that we are workers and honest. So, now we will be going home, may God be with us. Have a nice Sunday, but don't forget... we will stop, but let's stop united, let's stop together! Together! The freedom sun in shining rays Shined on the sky of the homeland in this moment If the pledge... Now everything is elapsing in the most porfect order... at the exit, in march, thousands of workers... were surprised by the violent repression of the policemen. Before he could leave the stadium... Lula was sourrounded by journalists. The minister of Work declared that there... the syndicate was precipitated... Did you hope that he will declare something else? They have to declare this. What is the position of the syndicate? The syndicate is on the workers side, always. It's Lula! It's Lula, mom! And you didn't tell me anything? I wanted that he had a profession, right? I didn't know that they will talk about him like this. I am sorry to say this, but the governator doesn't know what he says. Mom, take it, You have to eat, don't you want to have lunch anymore. It's ok, darling, leave it there. Leave it there, leave it there!! It's hot in here. -Where is mom? -She's in there. Luis! Come here, let me look at you. Did they hurt you? You never change, right, mom? In a time like this... and you are still worried with me? -Take me home. -Calm down, mom... you need to rest, they will only run some tests. I don't want to. Look, all i want... is a decent burial, that's all, my son. Can you stop with this, ok? It will happen, my son. Some time it will happen... but everything will be fine. I am so proud of you. Are you scared, are you? Scared? I am not, no... Look, my son... don't doubt yourself. You got so far already. Look, we always do what we can do. Even when it's not enought, you know what to do... Go there and do it. But, if it's not possible... Hope, ok? Be patient. The world is rotating, rotating... The opportunity will stop right in your hands. that's how it is. the impasse between the metallurgical workers from ABC... and their employers is getting every time bigger proportions. Without permission, the leaders of the syndicate and other operators... are camped in the building of the syndicate. To assure public order, the brazilian govern... sent a strong military team to surround the building... to persuade the workers to return to normality. I'll be back soon, Mr. Alvaro. He recognizes you, see, Luis lnacio? I didn't bring you just clothes to change, no. Here! I made a little snack too. We are there suffering a terrible pressure! Our syndicate is sorrounded by armoured vehicles! A lot of militaries are watching our syndicate! New information directly from Sao Bernardo do Campo. The demands made by the syndicate of the metallurgits... continue being denied... and the workers don't show any sign that they plan to give up. That's why, the millitary pressure is increasing... and the impasse is worring more and more the brazilian society. They are there, they will invade any moment now, damn it! Attention, we have orders to evacuate the building! People, listen, i know that it is difficult, but... We will have to sotp this strike! it's time to be smart! What will we be doing if this strike continues for months? How will our comprades pay their bills? But, if we go back now, we can still negotiate the striking days. You are a traitor. You are a traitor! -You are a traitor! -Shut up, you! Damn it! Calm down, people! Calm down, people! We have orders to evacuate the building! Attention, let's go out! You know what to do... then just go and do it. But, if you can't... wait. Look at our syndicate! Fucking traitor! You are to blame, Lula! Lula traitor! Saturday, 23rd of march 1979. Lula , the leader of the metallurgists... leaves the syndicate restricted by the govern. On this football stadium, the metallurgists... had their meeting of about 100 thousand participants. With intervention, the stadium was overtaken by the policemen. Today, we are using our church to be able to make our movement... and we are going until the end. With Lula or wihtout Lula, all of us are a Lula. Ei, son... You have so many obligations, right? The most important of all... is never to forget where are you coming from. You know? Comrades! This directorate... is here for the class... and for you. But, because the class doesn't seem to be happy with our attitude... to stop the strike... then, what we have to do... is let the decision in your hands... to those, who really are those that matter. Comrades, we go forward together... we fight together! What this directorate understood... is that we would get very delayed... if we lose everything we have gained... and took the decision based on that thought. Now, in order for this directorate to continue... then we need... we need... a vote of trust! Lula! Lula! Lula! The united workers will never be defeated! Sunday, again with Lula leading the movement... in the Cathedral of Sao Bernardo. Jesus Christ, the workers of ABC were forced to start a strike... to get a small increase in their salaries. Jeez, the women are working! Wait, wait. Lula, the journalists want to know if there will really be a strike? But it doesn't depend on us. Look, tell them that, if there will be a strike... it won't be only against the employers, no, it will be against the regime too. Now, Lula said several times... that tomorrow or later, for example, everyone can get locked. And from there on, how will the movement go? Dear workers. I know exactly how many promisses you already heard... and that plenty of them couldn't be materialized in facts and realizations. But i wouldn't hesitate to apply the existing laws... agains situations that are threatening... the security of the brazilian family. Luis lgnacio? Open this door! Stay calm. Don't worry. As my mom says, ''things will get better''. Comrades, at 6:30 in the morning... in his house. Lula is now... in a prison in Sao Paulo. What now, huh, Lula? This is cowardice! Cowardice of those that have the power! What will we do? Lula, Lula, Lula! Tiana, what are they saying about him there? Ah, i know it's nothing good, right? But nobody tells me anything. Oh, mom! It's nothing like that, no. Then, why didn't Luis come to visit me here anymore? Lula is traveling, mom, i already told you that... work for the syndicate. Mrs.Lindu? Like this, my son. Mrs. lindu, come here. Here, boy. I only know one thing, people. Those that are outside can't forget not even for one second... that we are locked in here. Damn it, we have the public opinion on our side! We can't forget about it not even for one second. What is the public opinion worth in a dictatorship, damn it? It's worth, yes! Why wouldn't it worth? It's worth, yes. They just managed to aprove the amnesty law. Why? It's worth, it's worth, yes, it will worth more and more! How are the kids? They are fine. And my mom, is she fine? She is the same. Son... everything will be fine now, ok? I feel so well. Listen, i never felt as well before. Things will get better. Persis! it's all about persisting! You are going, but you'll come back. Look, it's Lula there. Go Lula, you are right! Comrades! If they don't release Lula, nobody will work!! After 31 days in prison, Lula was released on presidency 3 times but he wasn't elected. He hoped... "I believe in a big future On 1st january 2003, Lula dedicated his biggest win ever, to one person in special. "Because our happiness is bigger than our pain." "Our power is bigger than our misery." Our hope is bigger than our fear. I believe in women and men... that, just like my beloved mother, Lindu... will never get cowered in front of life. To you, my mom, i dedicate this diplom... of president of the Rebublic that i just received. marinaursu@yahoo.com
