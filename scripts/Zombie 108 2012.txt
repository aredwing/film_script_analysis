Boys, get ready to move in. Yes, sir. What are you doing? Sir. There's still a lot of people in there, and many are injured. So what? Commander, in our school days, I always backed you up. Who is in command right now? Is it you, or is it me? Yes, sir. Sir, you are. But they are your men, too. We have to think about the bigger picture. Orders from above are to evacuate the whole of the Ximen area in the next 15 minutes. You know that the civilians here are relying on us to get them out safely. What?

I'm reporting from Taipei, Taiwan. The police have now set up blockades. The situation still looks rather gloomy. We've located an injured victim. Young lady, your whole family has died. How do you feel? Are you very sad? Were you bitten as well? When you were bitten by the zombies, did you feel any sensation besides pain? Young lady, if you don't look at the camera, it's difficult for us to interview you... Holy crap! Wait a minute, excuse me... What is that? Puck! Hurry! What are you doing? Reina was left behind. I've got to save her. Stupid cops, open fire! Boss, I'll get her. Get out of here. It's not your turn yet. Dudu, help him! Shit, a damn cop with good luck. Why the fuck were you guys attacking us? Why can't you speak Chinese? What the fuck you looking at? Hurry! Fuck! Hey, stop breathing. There's one! Don't move! It's gone. Are you OK? We've got separated from the captain. Stop worrying, will you? I'm out of ammo. Don't be scared. Last Friday... why didn't you take my call? Right now, that's what you want to talk about? With what's going on right now, when will I get another chance to talk about it? What? I'm out of ammo, too. Can we survive this? What are you scared of? Be a man. I'm not afraid. I won't be able to protect you any more. Who needs you to protect me? What did you want to tell me before? Actually, I... Run! I thought we agreed the cops would stay off our turf? A cop's promise is worth shit! I don't have time for your bullshit. A lot of civilians' lives are at stake. If you're so badass, then get us out of here. I'll get my men out. We're here right now. Let's charge out towards Xining South Road. Just charge out? There's a butt-load of zombies out there! What's up with you, tubby? Stand Still! Stand Still! You touch my man, you are dead. He's about to turn, and you're still protecting him? Fuck! You bit me! Fucking shit! You guys, cover me. Dudu, let's help Big Boss. Don't drag me away, I want to save my men. Go! Go! Damn foreigner, what are you doing here? Fuck you. Don't drag me, I want to save my men. Go! Pull down the gate! I thought you cops were supposed to be badass. Why? Fuck! It's not the zombies scaring me to death. It's this goddamned woman! Fucking A! How the hell did everything go to shit? You damn foreigner, what are you following us around for? Are we all here? Yeah. Where is my wife? Where's my wife? Honey, are you OK? What the fuck? What the fuck? I didn't leave you on purpose. It's hell out there. Are you OK? All right, don't be mad, don't be mad. Take my wife somewhere safe to clean up. Be careful. - Be careful. - You take care. We'll get away soon. What the hell is up with you? Are you retarded? We weren't coming after you. Look what you've done! You mind your own business, I'll mind mine. What? What? What? She's fainting. No need to scream just because she's fainting. You're going to scare me to death. Carry her. Hurry! Hurry! Let's go! - You guys have to be more careful. - Yes, sir. How much ammo do you have left? None, Captain. I don't have anything. I'm out. We still have our fists. Let's go! Come on! Come and play with daddy for a bit. Why are you so slow? The gangsters and the cops don't sit together. You ain't sitting with us. Jeez. Hey? Where is the other woman? She passed out. All right. Whatever. What are you looking at? What? You want to start shit with my boss? Weren't you bitten, too? L... I have a good immune system. I'm fine. What? What? What? That door is moving!

You're out of line. You're way out of line. What are you doing? What do you think you're doing? You're a piece of work. Just do what I tell you. Shit! I've got to wait a long time before I can enjoy you. Shit. Only foreign news for days. What's wrong with Taiwan? Bunch of fucking sissies. There's not even anything on the satellite news. It's only a few zombies. Damn, isn't that... Shit! It's that director who keeps making films with taxpayers' money. Now he's a zombie, too. Serves him right. I can't understand his shit at all. Five minutes and the camera doesn't move an inch. It's supposedly art. Bullshit. Complete balls. Why are you crying? I'll take you to your mum. Come on. No! I want to play. I want to play. How about an orange? Come on, have an orange. Mummy! Mummy! What a bunch of morons. Don't you ever learn? You can't even make electricity. You deserve to be zombies. I ain't playing with y'all today.

You're definitely a special one. Look at me! Let's see. Open your eyes. What, don't you want to live any longer? When are you going to let me go? Let YOU go? I ain't done playing with you yet! Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Don't forget I've still got your little girl. Where is my daughter? Where is she? Where is she? Your daughter? Shit, listen to me. She's watching TV upstairs.

Damn cops are trying to find a way out. Hey, where is my wife? Oh yeah, where is she? What's taking her so long? Where is she? Hey, someone's at the door. Take a look. Maybe she's back. - Honey? - Fuck! Block it! Block it! Hold it! Hold it! Reina! Captain? Captain. She's my wife. Please! Give me a little time. Honey? Honey? Honey, how did it happen? Honey! Honey.
