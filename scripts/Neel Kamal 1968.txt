Her shaking body stands as a statue... as though a stranger touched her. With a touch of the art from your hands... even vulgarity seems holy. I didn't even think... ...that art can be so great and grand. Really...your have brought heaven... on earth. This is by your grace Maharaj! An artist just sculpts the stone and makes the statue. But only connoisseur like you can determine... ...that the artist has seen his dreams come true in these statues. These are not only stone statues for him... ...but are live dancers. In which youth and vigor is displayed. I'm grateful to you Maharaj! I should be grateful to you Chitrasen! Kingdoms rise and fall... So many kings take birth... ...and so many die in the same place. But your paintings and statues are immortal. On their still lips, are the songs of our flourishing kingdom. Will be sung forever and ever! Artist!...l want to reward you! But what to give you? Maharaj, giving credit to the artist's art is everything for him. But that doesn't satisfy me. How can I ever prove to myself that I gave credit to your art. Chitrasen, you tell me what should I do. What should I offer you? This is the most difficult part Maharaj. The face that gave me life to work on these... ...the one who inspired my heart to create these... ...that is someone else Maharaj. That is someone else. If she can be given as a reward, then only you can give it. If I ask for that, will you give it to me? Oh!..So my artist is in love with someone? Do not forget that I am a king. A king can give you whatever you want. Tell me who is it? My heart, my life, my inspiration... this is it Maharaj. You are the king Maharaj! You can give whatever you wish. Please give me this gift. Please give it! Bring this famous artist to my special hall. What kind of justice is this Maharaj? Why am I brought here in shackles? You were the one who asked what do I want? Is this what I wanted, to be shackled like this? That I be brought here like a prisoner? Is this what I asked for Maharaj? ls this what? You asked for death! But I want to grant you life. I do not want an artist like you to be killed for no reason. Chitrasen, there is still time to deny any relationship to Neel Kamal! How can I say that Maharaj? How can I? How can I say that there's no relation between a nightingale, and the moon? How can I say that a honeybee can survive without a flower? How can I say? Chitrasen, you are slinging mud on the Kingdom's pride! No Maharaj, I'm not doing such a thing! This was destiny Maharaj!..That I saw the princess and I liked her. And she swept me off my feet. Today in this hall, I confess that I love the Princess... ...and because of her love and inspiration I created the palace. Quiet! Chitrasen, you are forgetting your status! Yes Maharaj, I am a simple artist, and her a Princess... ...but what does love have to do with status, caste and creed? What does the Royal Command have to do with the meeting of two hearts? Shut up!...He has disgraced the Princess! His tongue should be cut off! What kind of justice is this? I am being suppressed because I cannot tell the truth? My emotions are being suppressed so that I can't live with my love? The rich have always weighed a poor mans love in the scales of riches. But it was never sold, and never will be sold! Chitrasen, I will punish you in such a way for your mistakes... That the future generations will shiver when they hear about you! The royal swords have always cut the throat of lovers! But, love has always triumphed! And the biggest Emperor's and Kings, could not destroy love! And you and your Kingdom cannot destroy my love! Quiet sinner! Take him away and finish him! The palace which he created and forgot his status... ...bury him alive before dawn in that same palace! And this is my order, that no one ever mention his name... ...or ever know... ...what happened to this sinner! Take him away! And bury him alive! What will this do Maharaj?...You cannot kill me and take my love away! Love is immortal, my love is stronger than death! This body will finish, but my spirit will search for Neel Kamal! My love will bring Neel Kamal to me! She must come...she will come! The world will always mourn the deaths of those in love. What a great lover Chitrasen was. Really, Neel Kamal must have been beautiful. That is why Chitrasen built this palace and made his love immortal. I wish I were Neel Kamal too. And a Chitrasen would build a palace for me. Why a Chitrasen? There are so many Chitrasen's waiting for you. All these are cartoons! Legs like hen, and face like monkeys. And they expect to marry me? Hurry up, the Warden is calling. Where is Sita? She was with us...she may be inside. But what is she doing alone till now? Neel Kamal, you had to come. No one else but me. Chitrasen. Your Chitrasen. Chitrasen the sculptor, the one who built this theater for you. And they buried me alive between these walls. Because I loved you. And the ages have gone by. The times have changed. You have changed. But your Chitrasen hasn't changed. My love is immortal. Even in darkness that is death I have waited for you. Waited... In belief that one day you would surely come. And here you are! Now no one can separate us. No one can take you away from me. Sita, what are you doing here? Everyone is looking for you. What happened? Why don't you speak? Why don't you speak, Sita? She has fainted! Leave me. Let me go. - I won't. If the warden gets up, we'll be fined. The train is late. We're stuck here till 5 in the morning. And she's fast asleep. Who is it? Neel Kamal, why are you leaving me? Is my wait never to end? Come to me. Come to me, Neel Kamal. Are you out of your mind? Do you want to die? I...? Did I...? I don't remember anything. Strange! You don't remember? You would've been run down under that train. I saved you. But I was supposed to take that train home! My friends must be waiting for me. What do I do now? No need to worry. I'll drop you at the station. I have a car. She should be here any moment. - Sorry. Please cancel her ticket. I'll have to cancel all the tickets. I can't leave her here. I'm responsible for her. Strange. Why would Sita vanish into the darkness? Something must've happened to her. Looks like we will have to stay back. What if she doesn't turn up? All the tickets to tomorrows performance have been sold out. And Sita is the leading lady in both the dance items. Here comes your leading lady. With the leading man in tow! Sita, give him back his coat. Why don't you say who he was? This is a disgrace! I never expected this from you! What happened? - You fell on her. What's this "oui"? - You crushed my chest! That a likely repercussion of a fall. Nothing new. Sita, I'm not taking any action against you this time. Because... "That was a nice choice" Because your past record is good. But if you do that ever again, God help you! This is the second time Sita has disappeared. I told you how she disappeared from the railway station. When she returned, there was a man with her. I gave her a warning. But she has done it again. But how did she sneak out? - I don't know! The gate is locked. And the watchman is on guard duty. But Mr. Raichand, you're her father. Consider this. She disappeared... from the railway waiting room without telling the warden. Would you have spared us if she eloped with that boy? I know my daughter very well. I've given her a good upbringing. She could never have taken the wrong step. I have complete faith in her. - Every parent believes his child. But despite warnings, your daughter has been breaking all the rules. She scaled the walls of the hostel. And she has stayed away for nights together. You have been a principal. You know, as Dean of the college... I am responsible for the girls in this college. To save the reputation of this college, I have to expel Sita. I cannot afford to keep a rotten apple. Is the college closed for holidays? Yes. Just get her luggage in. Daddy! You believe whatever she says? Don't you trust your own daughter? You should've asked me. - Not necessary. I don't think the Dean is your enemy. Maybe what she said is true. You...? After all these years! All these years since your mother died! I brought you up with such great expectations! And today, the world speaks ill of you! It breaks my heart! Your mother named you after Sita. She had such hopes! And Sita, that ideal of womanhood had to prove her chastity. You didn't eat last night either. Eat something, Daddy. If it's my fault, go on, punish me. Kill me, if you think I'm going astray! Kill me! I don't know what comes over me. Something happens after I've gone to sleep. I don't know anything. I swear by my dead mother! I have done nothing wrong. I'd kill rather kill myself than bring you to shame! I beg of you, Daddy! Don't misunderstand me! Please don't misunderstand me! I've done nothing wrong! What you do after you've fallen asleep... why you do what you do... where you go... you remember nothing? And what after you've come awake? I feel terrible. I feel like I'm dead, numb. I can't even remember what happened the moment before. I feel like weeping... like breaking down and crying! Why does this happen? This boy you love... what kind of a person is he? Do you think your father isn't going to like him? No Doctor! You go looking for him in the nights. IQ! Now don't hide it from me. I'm going to help you. There's nothing wrong about falling in love. But you mustn't hide it. Tell me, who is he? There's no one! I'm not in love with anyone! Please! Don't get me wrong! That's what I keep telling everyone! Don't misunderstand me! But no one will listen to me! What do I do?! But now we know something. You aren't suffering from any disease. Really? I'm not suffering from any disease? Right. No disease. But you're weak. And you have loss of memory. Now take care of yourself. Daddy! You needn't worry. I'm perfectly all right. It isn't any disease. The doctor said so. Perfectly all right. You've made her believe that she's sick. That Principal inside you! Go home. And make sure you drive carefully. I'll be with the doctor for a while. I was right. Who's the fellow? Did you tell her that she's free to choose whomever she wants? You're completely wrong. There's no man. Sita is a sleepwalker. You mean she scaled the walls of the hostel in her sleep? These sleep-walkers will climb cliffs, swim rivers... and in that senseless state, they might even kill. And afterwards, they won't even remember a thing. God! What is going to happen to my girl? Not to worry overmuch. But before the news spreads... and she gets a bad name, you should get her married. Marriage? What if it persists even after marriage? Afterwards, she'll get busy with her own household. And there's the husband. Once she has had children... God willing, she will be all right. Have nothing to worry, Raichand. Worry, and you'll lose faith in God. Had her mother been alive, finding a suitable boy would've been easy. But when the father shoulders the whole responsibility... matchmaking takes so much time. Can you suggest something? I have a boy in mind. God willing, the match might be agreed upon. Go on. Please tell me. Have you heard of Thakur Ummat Singh? His villa is next to my temple. Avery prominent family. Who doesn't know him? But he died last year, didn't he? Avery noble man. He used to be a trustee on the college board. Yes. It's his son. Ram. He's educated. Fine boy. He is taking care of all the businesses. What better a match for our Sita? Who else are there in the family? - Small family. His mother... she's a bit stern though. But she's a good woman. There's a sister too. Married. Her husband lives with them. The son-in-law lives with his in-laws. Girdhar they said, is a fine poet. And by and by, Girdhar becomes the son-in-law about-the-house. Any more clothes to be ironed? Hurry up. At this rate, the bridegroom's father will be here... and I'll be standing here like this. Why are you standing here? Just walk in there. As you are. What did you say? - Every breath holds a prayer. Every moment the passions rise. Give it to me! Stop it. Hold this. She's shy, she's coy, she gives me the slip. Here she comes! Yes, Mummy? You're still in a state of undress. They are here. We're waiting for you. I'll be in a moment. Take a look at her photograph. - Later. Go away now. Who is she? - She...? The neighbor! Hello there. How's your grandson? - Having teething troubles. What are you doing here? Go on. Help Ram get dressed. We're waiting. Now go on. May I see the photo? - All right. What a girl! Why didn't I see her before? This is a question of my life! You want me to marry just anyone? Someone I don't even know? - What's wrong with that? Look at me. I never knew whom I was marrying before I married her! One look at you, and I said yes! We're discussing my marriage. - When did I say I'm marrying? It's a matter of my life! - When did I say it's my life? Girdhar, why don't you understand? - I understand everything. Why not take a look at this photo before you make up your mind? It's no use. Send them away. Please yourself. It's your choice. But this girl is a bomb! And he wants more? Sure! I want more! Girdhar! - Yes? What are you after?! - The photo! But it's no use now. I'm sending them away. What a melodrama! - It's just begun. But it's your marriage! - When did I say it's your marriage? But it's a matter of your life! - When did I say it's your life? Why don't you understand? - I'm beginning to. Show me that photograph. - But I'm giving it back. This concerns my family prestige! - You don't put it before your life! I gave Mummy my word! - Damn Mummy! How about speaking for yourself? Didn't I tell you she's a bomb? That she is! Love at first sight! I am most fortunate that you have accepted my daughter. I have great faith in the priest. I have taken his advice. The stars portend well. The girl will prove lucky. Whatever she be, I have given her to you. She is lucky. She will find a mother's love again. She will serve you all her life. Your mother would've been so happy! Your mother would've taken care of everything. But your father begs of you. I'm the son-in-law. The name is Girdhar Gopal Agarwal. G.G. Agarwal. You must've thought I'm a thief. I'm the son-in-law about the house. A little gift for you. No, don't be shy. You make me shy too! Take this. Good. Did you have to use the window? - In this house, we do things... in a roundabout manner. Do what you want to... but make sure you take the long wrong roundabout. Girdhar, Mummy is looking for you. That was my wife. She has an awful voice. The son-in-law is like a servant in this house. The boss has summoned me. So off I go. God bless you. Oh I forgot something! Congratulations. For the marriage. To hold you in my eyes forever... to keep you in my heart forever, that is all I wish. In your eyes, I seek love. - The eyes deserve the darkness. I knew you would come. And here you are. Who are you? Your Chitrasen. Your lover. I have no lover but my husband. Just a ritual, and a man you don't even know becomes your husband? What about me? Am I no one? For ages, I have burnt in my desire for you. Neel Kamal, I was killed because I loved you. But I couldn't die because I love you. And you have forgotten me so completely? But my love is immortal. No one can stand in our way. Come with me, Neel Kamal. Beyond the boundaries of life and death. Come, be one with me! Come, Neel Kamal. I am going back to my husband. My life is for Ram. For my Ram. Are you going away, Neel Kamal? But where will you go? Wherever you are, you will always find me. There you are. And I've been looking for you everywhere. And I thought, where's my newly wedded bride gone? What's this? You're missing your father already? Silly girl! I'll give you all my love. Is there anyone else who is luckier than me? Silly girl. Love is so precious. You count your blessings. Love! Love is so precious! This is killing! Who is it? Who screamed? I thought a witch was about to strangle me! I won't talk to you! Thank you very much! Good night. Don't you know how much I love you? But you don't love me at all! What fool told you that? Mummy. - Goodness! Forgive the slip. And I'm angry with you. - Why? Because you've never picked me up in your arms. Tonight, I feel like flying! Want to fly? I'll buy you an airline ticket. Not an airplane. I want to fly in your arms. Go on. Fly. And sing a song! Now what happened? It hurts! - Where? I'm feeling breathless! Massage my waist, please. Breathless with an ache in the waist? No can do. All right. Then rub my feet. Handyman by day, and masseur by night! Keep going to the office so late, and the business is as good as gone. But at least he remembers to attend the office. And the princess is still in bed. Mummy, I guess it's time you left on some long pilgrimage. No, that won't be necessary. You still haven't had a bath? Women in this household always take a bath before the sun has risen. This is the rule. - But... Poor thing. She must've gone to bed late. But why should she bother? She owns this house, doesn't she? How did this ring come here? It's a gift. A gift? But it's mine! - Then take it. How did it come here? I've been looking for it. Your husband gave it to me. - Girdhar! Bloody thief! What are you saying? He's your husband. To a woman, the husband occupies the place of God. I'll show that God some! I was a man of parts before they turned me into a servant! Fie on you! Look at me, won't you? - Who else am I looking at? Drop that charm and tell me where the ring is! That ring! Darling, do you know what the ring reminds me? Remember the day when you first threw your arms around me neck? The ring! Where is it? That's just what I'm telling you. Your fingers were so delicate! And remember the promise we made? We'd stay together all our lives. We'd love each other. And after that... after that... and we'd never leave each other! Yes! I still remember that day! You were slimmer, your neck used to be slender... and that sway of your hips, the swish of your plaited hair! You were so delicate. Like a flower. There were deep seas in those eyes! Those sweet lips! But you were so slim. Must you eat so much? Go slow on the hair! It hurts. Get out of here! Where's my ring? Not again! Did you get out of the wrong side of the bed? Why do you want to harass me? Come. Come into my arms! Don't you touch me! You think you can fool me? I know where my ring is! - That ring? Yes! - Why didn't you tell me before? Here it is. Thief! I didn't steal anything. I worked out a plot. I made the gift. I impressed the bride. Now it's back with you. Nice trick right? Thief! Parasite! You called me a parasite? Yes! - Thanks a lot! Nice name. But as for you, you deserve something worse! Why didn't you give her something out of your hard-earned money? Thank you! You've opened my eyes! I'll give her a present out of my hard-earned money! Your hard-earned money? That's what I'm going out to earn! The hard way! This is the result of your foolishness! Had you not screamed at him, he wouldn't have been... making us look like fools! - He deserves to be screamed at. That fool! He's coming right up our alley. This fellow is such an embarrassment! You're the one who wanted... a good-for-nothing fellow for a son-in-law. Silly you! As long as he's good-for-nothing... he stays under your thumb. Once he starts earning... you've all but lost him. Imagine yourself... living with him in a shanty. It is a bottle of essence. But it stinks of kerosene. Smell it. - Let me see. It smells of henna! - That's the henna on my hand. The kerosene is inside the bottle. Not kerosene. It smells of hooch. Which one of us? What do you mean? I see. She's coming. Just do as I told you. All right. - Start. You have no one in this whole wide world? The only one I have is this wife of mine. She calls me a widower. Is she dead? - Not at all. But she has thrown me out of her heart. Forget her. From now on, I'm your... Mother? Be mine. My heart and my home is yours. I'd really like to have your address. Sounds like something broke. My heart. It makes a real clatter when it breaks. Come with me. - Where are you taking me? You' re so innocent! Come with me... - No! Come with me. No! The door is wide open. What will people say if they see us? The wife! She made a Heaven out of our house. And she sent me to live in Heaven. How dare you?! I'll break your face! - I'll scratch your face! I'll pull your hair! - I'll tear your hair! I'll scratch your eyes out! - I'll gouge your eyes out! Get lost! I've seen so many like you! Really? What are you doing? Biting is against the rules of wrestling! That's a foul! Foul! Foul! You stop whistling! I'm in Heaven! No. You're in the arms of the woman who loves you. Am I ? Mummy! Get up! What is it? Has Girdhar run away again? Not Girdhar! It's your son's bride! My son's bride? - She went out just now. And she's all decked up. To meet someone. Now get out of bed before this goes out of hand! Come on! Hurry! No one must know. It's a matter of our prestige. The women of the house protect their honor. Let Ram come. It's late at night. Why aren't you asleep? Something is terribly wrong! - What? No! I don't want to die. Leave me alone! Why do you remind me again and again? I have nothing to do with you. I don't know you. No! Don't touch me! I'm someone's wife! I belong to my husband! Go away! Not to worry. I've examined your wife. She isn't suffering from any disease. She needs care. Your wife was telling me that you're taking her for a holiday. Yes. I thought she could use a change. But make sure you don't leave her alone. The seizures may recur any time. Someone or the other must stay with her at all times. There you are. You' re quite late. I'm going on a tour tomorrow. Urgent business. What is the matter? You look upset. And why not? His wife has gone astray. She was out today also. Where did she go? Must be to meet her Romeo. A woman like this should be thrown out of this house. Throw a woman out, and you will lose what prestige you have left. She's a blot! Then just kill her. The blot will be gone. And your prestige will be saved. This is driving me crazy! What's happening to her? Where does she go? You remember nothing? Have you forgotten who you are? Neel Kamal. Princess Neel Kamal. And I am your Chitrasen. Chitrasen who loved you. I gave my life for you! Remember when I used to sing? And you would dance. Remember? Where am I? In the lake. Lake? - Yes. Who brought me here? How did I come here? Your character! Tell me the truth... did you bring me here? Oh yes! The husband does this! He takes you out to the lake in the middle of the night! To make sure his family gets a bad name. So that people can point fingers at me! The man whose wife sneaks out in the dark of the night. She dresses up like a doll, and goes to meet someone! That's not true! - Really? And you expect me to disbelieve my ears? Go on, say it isn't true. Who is it? Whom are you seeing? I'm telling the truth. I'm not seeing anyone! Believe me! There's no one else but you! I swear it! You are all I have! I swear it by you! Please Ram! Don't leave me! Punish me, do what you want! But don't leave me! Take me with you! I've sacked all the servants. Here's the balance. You can keep the change. And come with me. Let's fix the princess. Sure! You aren't a newly-wedded bride anymore. It's time you started taking care of the household. I'd like to do that. Go on. Please yourself. All the servants are away on leave. Ram isn't at home. Who are you dressing up for? When she goes out to meet someone, she has to dress up, right? That's what I want to fix. Lock these dresses up. And give me the keys. Use this pair. One to wear, and one to wash. You'll find the pots and pans in the kitchen. Make sure you clean the vessels before you cook. This day on, you're going to do the chores. Get it? Come on, Chanchal. What are you doing?! Have all the servants dropped dead? They are away on leave. - Been made to leave, I guess. This bodes ill! No lady of the house in a reputed family does the pots and pans. Let me do it for you. - No! I'm good at it, thanks to them. - No! Let go. Goodness! Lovely teamwork! What a team! A sleepwalker and a sloth! Made for each other! So here they are. Did you father teach you that? I broke it. You? So you're cleaning the vessels! Yes... - You don't! I ask him for a glass of water, and he says his hands are aching! I ask him for a pillow, and he starts feeling dizzy! And here you are! Lending a helping hand! I guess I'll have to ask the lady. What's your magic? Forgive me, won't you? You make sure what you are before you open your mouth! Don't you rouse the sleeping lion! You don't know what you stand to lose! If this is what sleeping lions are like... men are going to be ashamed of themselves! You call yourself a man? You wash my clothes! You clean the dishes, you sweep the floors... you massage your wife's feet! And you call yourself a lion! Sorry, my mistake. But I'm not going to live in sin! Get lost! Before I leave, let me tell you this. You'll pay for what you're doing to this poor thing! I've known her ever since she was a child. She has had a good upbringing. - Thanks to her upbringing... I've lost face in society! You call this upbringing! Do women sneak out of their houses at nights? Cursed luck! He's my only son! And he's so unhappy! He can't even sleep! He sits up all night, policing his wife. Is this some revenge? Did you want to take a revenge? But you should've told me! Why did you hide it from me? My fault. I advised him to keep it under cover. I had expected her to recover after the marriage. I was stunned when she told me that Sita sneaks out at night! She was cursing me. She said I've betrayed her trust. She accuses Sita for giving their family a bad name. There's much unhappiness at home. - Do they suspect her fidelity? She could kill herself for this! - You must do something. I'll go over right away. I'll apologize. I'll beg. Sita isn't at fault. Now that the truth is out... the father comes up with a likely tale! Somnambulism! I can't say I have ever heard something like that! And we've never seen another woman like that one! Please don't say that. You see, it's all my fault. I should've told you everything. She would never commit such a grave sin! What makes you say that? The trust a father has in his daughter. Trust the father and believe the daughter! Experience tells me what an expensive exercise it is! Our name has been sullied. My son's life has been destroyed! My only son! She's not what you think she is. She's a very good girl. Very good indeed! She uses the cover of the night to prove her fidelity! Who are you trying to fool? I'm ashamed to think I'm related to you! You keep your "good girl" to yourself! What are you saying? Take your daughter away. And don't you send her back! Punish me all you want! But not my daughter. Your daughter doesn't stay here any longer! Now I've spoken. How can you send your son's bride away? Have mercy on me! L beg Of you! Daddy! What are you doing?! I can put up with anything in life! But I won't have you insulted. What happened to you, my child? I'm being put to test. What a melodrama! The tragedienne in tears and tatters! That's how she wants to portray herself! This deserves an applause! Staging a melodrama for your father! So now you like to dress up like a servant? The least you could do was comb your hair! This is ominous! She isn't even wearing her wedding bracelets! You witch! My son is away, and you wish he's dead! You want him dead, and out of the way, don't you? Don't you speak ill of my husband! You dare talk back! You slut! Daddy! My child! Are you hurt? - No. Blood...? No. It's no blood. It's just water. Had I any blood, would it not boil... when I see my child suffer like this? Right now. You're coming with me right now! No Daddy! You told me once that girls from good families... leave the homes of their husbands only once... when they are dead. I'll leave here once I'm dead. Please go away, Daddy. No! I can't leave you like this! For my sake, Daddy! Bless me Daddy, that I may redeem myself! Where are the servants? Are you deaf or something? Sita! Open the door! For my sake? What happened to you? Nothing. Nothing happened to me. Look at me. I'm so happy! Is there anyone in this world who's luckier than I am? Let me go now. There's a lot of work to do. And I'm all-alone. You went through all this, and you didn't even write to me! You won't leave me ever again, will you? You brought me here. You won't send me away before I die, will you? No. Don't be afraid. Mummy! No! You mustn't tell your mother anything! Come with me. Mummy... Mummy, what have you done to her? When did you arrive? No! Don't! What have you done to her? - Why ask Mummy? Ask the princess. Don't interfere. I left her in your care. And when I get back, I see that she's working like a servant! There isn't a servant in the house! You expected me to keep the servants... so that they could tell stories of her escapades? The lady of the house stays out all night! Now listen to me carefully. I won't keep servants... till this wanton woman stays here. If she was a wanton woman, she would never have put up with this torture. You are a slave to your wife! She has you enticed! She has brought the family a bad name! And you expect me to sit quietly? Not as long as I'm alive! So what do you want to do? You want to kill her? Go on! Kill her! You call your mother a killer? - Kill her. And save your name. Come on. We're leaving. I won't live in a house of sin! Stop! Please don't go! Please don't go away! L beg Of you! I'll go away from here. It's all my fault. Cursed luck! Get out of my sight! Slut! If anyone goes away... What will people say? I'll be accused of setting son against mother! Will you have me disgraced? The disgrace will kill me! And what will Daddy say? He isn't going to be proud. Is this the upbringing he gave me? That's far from the ideal he seeks in me. I have never asked you for anything. But this one thing I beg you for. Will you refuse me? This is all I want. And no more. Why aren't you ready yet? But Mummy, it's just eight o'clock. Please put on the last hook for me. Is Sita ready? No. She took ill as soon as she saw Ram. Switch off the light please. I have grown so accustomed to the darkness. I'm scared of the light. You aren't ready yet? We're going to a party. Please, I'm not feeling well. If you don't go, I don't either. - No. Your mother will mind it. What is she going to think? - Let her think what she wants. You aren't well. How can I leave you? If you really want, we could... No. Aren't you a bit head-over-heels in love? Go on. Your mother is calling you. Go on. Must I? When you get back, you'll find me waiting for you. Ram! Help me! Ram! Where are you?! Ram! I'm so afraid! Come with me. IQ! Come. Come unto me. No! I don't want to die! This is the night! Come. You must come. Come Come with me Where are you taking me? Ram! Where are you, Ram? Come Strange, isn't it? A beautiful woman... all alone so late at night? Something amiss? Come to me, my love. Come She's going to kill herself. Come Strange! The car crashed, and not a scratch on her? God has saved her. Carry her to the keep. - All right. Listen... please send your husband to the police station tomorrow. Make sure he's carrying your driving license. Slop! There's no place in this house for you! Why? Stop acting innocent. The police drop you home in the middle of the night! And you ask why? Get out of here, you slut! I've heard enough of that. If I leave this house, your son is going to come with me. You? So you heard me? Look, you mustn't fight with your mother. As long as you are with me, as long as I have your love, your trust... whatever they say doesn't matter to me. Sita, the day we were engaged... I was so happy- I know. And I have always loved you. I have loved you more than myself! I know it. Deep in my heart. You promised me you'd be mine. And mine only. And I also said that I'd be born again and again, for your sake only. But it's marred now, isn't it? Don't talk like that in front of everyone! I'll make a clean breast of it. In front of everyone. Right here, in front of the people who call you a slut, a blot... let me tell you that they are right! Don't say that! You want to put me to test too? Those metaphors are of no use. Then I won't be a burden on you. If I put up with everything, it was for the sake of your love... for the sake of the trust you reposed in me. Now that it's no more... I won't stay here for a moment. Not even if you want me to. I haven't been able to redeem myself. Bless me that I may redeem myself in my death. Where's my daughter? Give my daughter back to me! I'll take her away! This is the last you'll see of us! I promise! Your daughter isn't here. Where is she? The police told me that they dropped her home after the accident. This is a respectable household. This isn't a home for destitutes. Destitute. . . ? She bore this torture, and she said not a word of protest. She slaved for you. She slaved for her husband. And you call her a destitute? But to me she's a daughter! I gave her a mother's love. I was the father, the mother, the brother, the sister! I meant everything to her. When I gave her to you, I thought you'd give her a mother's love. Before you threw her out, the least you could've done... was to call this unfortunate man. I could've seen her one last time! Now what do I do? Where do I go? Tell me! Where have you sent her? I needn't have. She was looking for a chance to escape. You have a daughter too! Don't you know how hard... it is for a parent to hear ill spoken of the daughter? If all mothers-in-law are shrews like you... every father will strangle the girl-child as soon as she is born. Enough of your nonsense. Had you been a respectable man, you would've killed yourself... when you heard what your daughter is up to! It is said that greedy fathers have wayward daughters. Get out! You've heard only half the story. She was traveling all alone in that car. There was no one with her. Once, she was walking to her death on the railway tracks. She would've died under a train. But someone saved her life. He should've let her die. She never have to live through this. Are you out of your mind? Do you want to die? L...? Did I...? I don't remember anything. Strange! You don't remember? You would've been run down under that train. I saved you. Suicide is a grave sin. It is cowardice. My life weighs down on me. Never say that. Life is a gift from God. Joy and sorrow are part of life. Brave is one who bears it all. Besides, you're going to become a mother. What do I do? Where do I go? Don't worry. I'll send word to your father. No! I can't show him my face! He told me that I must live with my husband till I die! No! I can't show him my face! Please! Grant me shelter here. I have no one else but God! As The Lord wishes. In mythology, Sita asked for shelter too. And she was chaste. You may stay here, my child. No one will know. Your medicines. One dose every four hours, and lots of rest. He pulled you out of the river. You were unconscious. You...? Yes. This is the sinner who has saved your life. A grave sinner, you might say. I ruined my mother-in-laws plot. Just you wait and see what I do. Girdhar! What's wrong with you? No! You can't take my Chanchal away from me! I've always loved my wife! I've served my wife! Body and soul! Take me if you want to! Kill me! Don't take my Chanchal away from me! Out of my WHY! She's gone! Gone! Gone forever! I'm ruined! My wife is dead! The rituals of widowhood! Now I'm a widow! You've left me a widow, my love! God rest her soul. Do I hear my beloved? Where is she? In Heaven? Not it must be Hell. I knew it! You'd go straight to Hell! My love! I'm coming! They used to burn widows on the pyres of their dead husbands. This day onwards, widowers will also follow their dead wives. I'm going to light the pyre of my dead wife. And I'll throw myself in her pyre! I'll make a barbecue of myself! Help! Rest in peace, my beloved! Mummy! Help! What happened? You! It's you! Who do you think you are? Death's angel? No one can separate lovers! Not even the angel of death! I'm going to burn myself on her pyre! No! I don't want to die! Help me! Save me, Mummy! You're like my own mother! Save my life! - What's going on? I've killed Sita! You've killed Sita? - Yes! Is Sita dead? - Dead as a dodo! Look at this. Where did you find this? - I slipped it off her finger. Dead! No. Don't cry. In a few years from now, you'll go to Heaven too. Don't cry. Sit down. The poor boy looks devastated. I'll get him a glass of milk. - Topped with cream, please. Sure! Why are you crying? Come. Come into my arms. That's just what I had in mind. Time Ram married again. After much thought, I've reached a conclusion. You are the wisest of them all. Whatever you have done is right. And I was so wrong. I might be harsh with words. But I love you. I love you more than my Chanchal. - Now who would say no to that? Come on Chanchal. Feed him a sweet. Chanchal my love, I'm so happy today. I'm really very happy. But something is wrong. Wrong? - Something terribly wrong. You want Ram to marry again, don't you? But what about a girl? - There's a girl. And she's far better than Sita. So you have it all worked out? Of course! So you knew! You knew that Ram and Sita would split! Of course! You are great! You are omniscient! What if Ram refuses? Not to worry about that. Leave it to me. Should I finalize it? Take the first train. Make sure you carry ornaments and dresses... for the girl. You must finalize a date for the engagement. God bless you! I'm going right away! Can I go with Mummy? Of course you will, my love. Here's one for the road. I leave it to you to convince Ram. Not to worry. Enjoy the magic. Lord! You set the city of Lanka for the sake of Lord Ram. Here, I take over from You. Godspeed, and help me. And please make sure I don't make a barbecue of myself! That jewelry belongs to Sita. It has no place in this house. This is sacrilege! Give it to me. I'll throw it into the gutter. I know! You want to give it to your new bride, don't you? New bride? - She's beautiful. Educated. And she comes from a reputed family. The best part of it is... she's of sound character. That's what they say. But I don't know for sure. Anyway, your mother made a mistake once. She won't be fooled again. Fooled? - What else? I shouldn't be saying this. But I can't stop myself. What woman would sneak out of the house... in the dead of the night when her husband is asleep... to meet a secret lover? - Shut up! Sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Not to be. Now I know for sure. All I wanted to know is how much you love Sita? Curse my stupid luck! She's innocent. And I threw her out of the house. Don't blame yourself. Of course, you don't know... that your mother and Chanchal have been playing foul. They tortured her! And this, when she was pregnant. With your child! Yes! She's pregnant. I have committed a grave sin! What do I do now? Where do I find her? I am a slut! Touch me, and you will sin! Sita, listen to me. - No! Don't touch me! I know what you will say! You'll tell me that I'm flawless! You'll tell me that you've loved me more than yourself! And today, you'll spurn me again! Mercy! Have pity on me! I have been damned! I can't even die in peace! Wait, Ram. You married her, and you took her away from her father's house. But you have neglected her. You are taking her away from the house of God. If she is wronged again, God will never forgive you. That will never happen again. Not as long as I am alive. Till my last breath, no one can take me away from Sita. I won't allow this sinner to live in this house. As long as I am alive, I won't let a bastard be born in this house. You are enticed by her beauty. You cannot even see! The child she is carrying belongs to someone else! That's a lie! I have full faith in Sita. Please, Mummy. Don't drag this out of proportions. You dare threaten me? Get this clear. In this house it's either she or me. I will never commit this sin of throwing my mother out of the house. Keep your prestige, keep your honor, keep the house. In mythology, when Lord Ram was sent away to the forest... Sita accompanied him. And now you want to banish Sita. Your Ram goes with her. Come on, Sita. This house is ours no more. What did you say? What a mother! You banished your own son! And you, are you happy at last? Faith accompli, or not yet? I'll finish the rest of it for you. What nonsense is this? - I won't stand by... and watch this injustice! - Go to Sita then. If I leave, my wife leaves with me! Like mother like daughter! She won't go with you! Who says she won't? You'll live with me, won't you? Let go of my hand! I can't let go of your hand, can I? I took you as my wife before the sacred fires. You go wherever I go. Off to the forest! And we build ourselves a first class hut! Make sure you serve me. That'd lighten the burden of your sins. Let her go! You can't force her to go! Who's using force? I married your daughter! Go to the police. Go to the law. One minute... Darling, how old you are? That's if you don't mind. This has gone as far as the police. 22 years. 22? Then why are you hiding behind your mother? Come to me! Not you! Not even your father can stop my wife! I can't stay away from Mummy! Oh, come along now! I warn you, Girdhar! You won't get a penny out of me! You're going to live like a beggar! I care two hoots for your money! I hope the house haunts you. Guess who's going to serve you every time you want a glass of water? Ghosts! And the owls and the bats will come to live here. And the specter of death will hang over your head! Enjoy the dance of death! Get out of here! Out! Go away! All of you! I want no one! Get lost! Did you pull the chain? The chain... did you pull it? No. Who is sharing the compartment with you? My wife. Welcome, Neel Kamal! Chitrasen welcomes you! After ages, the dance floor will come alive again! This is where our love story began. Alas, never to be consummated! Tonight, the story will come to an end. At the crossroads of life and death we stand. We, the lovers separated for centuries! The theater will reverberate once again to our ballads! Do you not recognize yourself yet? Do you not remember, Princess Neel Kamal? These statues... look at them. After centuries of darkness, they will see the light again. And you are Neel Kamal. You are the one. Put your ears to their lips, and you will hear them speak of our love. Look into their eyes, and you will see our past reflected. Have you forgotten everything? But I remember everything, Neel Kamal. That day of the spring festival when you were wet with colors. You were playing with the colors. Pictures from a past. Unforgettable. I looked on and on. And you painted my life in the colors of your love. Colors! There was color everywhere. The touch of color in the skies! The colors of the earth! The colors of our bodies, and in our hearts, the color of love. How could I forget that day of the spring festival? You've painted me red! You were all reds and yellows! You looked so pretty! Remember, you carved my statue to get even with me? Yes, I emptied a pitcher-full of water over your head. And then you slipped and fell! And you were limping. I'm not going to talk to you. Why? Have I done anything wrong? Don't try to act innocent. As if you know nothing! Didn't you promise to see me that evening after the theater... was inaugurated? Why didn't you? - Your father offered me a reward. And you forgot all about your Neel Kamal? And you used to tell me that I'm the very life for you! That whole night I stayed up for you. And I cried for you. The next morning, my father sent me away suddenly. And when I came back, I found out that you had simply vanished. Why? Why did you do that to me? Why did you leave? Did no one tell you what happened to me? What? I was put in chains. In chains! Chains? But why? Because I loved you. But loving someone is no sin. That's no crime. A crime it was. A heinous crime. That's what your father thought. The King offered me a reward. I asked for you. And then? I was buried alive. That statue of yours. They buried me right in front of your statue. In that well. And I kept looking at you till my eyes shut. Till my last breath, I called for you. So it was you? A voice filled with pain! So much of pain! Call me! Once again! Go on! I have waited ages to hear that call! If a sacrifice is called for to free your soul... I'll willingly give up my life. Sacrifice? Will you sacrifice your life? For the sake of my soul? No, Neel Kamal! That I shall never have! That can never be! This is the final test of love. You are mine. Yet, I give you up, Neel Kamal. In your happiness I rejoice. That is what I desire for you. Statues of Sita in these ruins? Sita comes in here... and that well crashes... the chains, that skeleton... a liberated soul perhaps? Is it related to some past life? Maybe I won't understand it. In the Gita, Lord Krishna says... "Arjuna, you and I have lived many lifetimes" "But we differ in perception. For I remember all my past lives" "But you have forgotten yours" "Because you haven't attained enlightenment" It was some power that drew Sita away in the nights. But I was convinced that Sita is chaste. Sita is mine. And I belong to Sita. Where am I? I don't want to become a son-in-law about-the-house again! I swear it! By my father! My mother! By my children-to-be! Mummy has come to take Ram and Sita. Have you really come here to take Ram and Sita home? You are great! Better late than never! I know at last what they mean to me! My children have forgiven me. Won't you forgive me? Glory to the mother-in-law!
