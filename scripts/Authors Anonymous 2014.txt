Yeah, like the Kardashians. I love that show. You know that I love that show. I wanted to do a show like that. Really? A documentary? What's that? So... so this is going to be a documentary about our writing group? I thought... I thought it was gonna be just about us. Just... I mean not that it should be just about us, 'cuz you know, there's more people... But I mean we are the main people in the group, honey. I thought-? Yeah, I mean I guess this is going to be like that thing that we watched on cable the other night. The holocaust. Yeah, the holocaust... That was- long, right? That was very long, but, I mean... It was, it was... Like- powerful. Heavy. Powerful. Yeah. Heavy. But, I mean... We-we love documentaries. Yeah, we love 'em. We do. We love them. Don't we, Winston? Does the red light mean that the camera's on? So all of this was? What? Hello. Maria! Can you come get Winston, please? Winston, you gotta go. Maria. Hold on. I gotta find Maria. We can't, we can't. Maria! Well, welcome to our humble abode. We moved here a couple of years ago- Maria! Honey. It's kind of a dream, dream house for us. You know what, maybe? We should... I'm not dressed. Can we just start over? Our writing group meets every Tuesday night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's. Sometimes we rotate. That's me with the dorky glasses. I love coming to the group. Everyone has such constructive feedback. Natasha the Russian peasant dressed oh so slowly. Consumed totally, completely, absolutely, definitely by endless thoughts of Yuri fondling her breast. His other hand groping her womanhood, knowing any second that she might explode. Her chastity spraying across the ceiling like passionate grafitti. Natasha never thought such a moment possible. Have I satisfied you, Natasha? Yuri had inquired after their fourth round of vodka soaked love making. Niet. Not yet, Natasha stated. Exhausted, but greatful. Comments? I have to say I love the way that Yuri is developing. You do? Colette, I love the character. Ok. If you ask John k butzin, you're gonna have to explain why this woman would go awol on her husband. What? That's so iffy to me. I was a little bothered by that too. Why would Natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed up young punk? Well... I've been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and I don't know. Poodles, it's ok. It's not ok, Alan. It's not. I mean I can't find the motivation for Natasha like everybody else can. So I can't, I'm not a writer. Woah, time out, ok. The dude is good in bed. That is all the motivation she needs. Listen, I would torpedo chapter 2, and just pull all the focus back onto this nijinski dame. Natasha. Yeah. I-I agree with John and William. That's exactly what I was gonna say. I think just make it more clear that Natasha wants to be closer to Yuri. Writing can be such a solitary existence, so it's great to have this outlet where you can exchange ideas with other writers. I mean with this group, it really is all for one and one for all. I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas and cleaning carpets. Which are good jobs for a writer 'cuz you meet lots of interesting people. My whole life I dreamed about playing football for the fighting illini. And uh, I got to go to the university of Illinois on a full ride college football scholarship. But, right at the beginning of my freshman year, I blew my knee out. And that ended that dream. And that same fall, I took English 101. Dr. buchannon. He introduced me to steinbeck and Hemingway and Fitzgerald and he encouraged me to write. It just set me off on a whole new creative journey. Hi, I'm originally from Prescott, Arizona. I followed my mom out here about four years ago. There she is back there. Stop. My parents are divorced. Not fault. So I moved here and, um, got into a few writing classes I just loved it. 24/7 total dedication. The writing always comes first. That's my mantra. She even had it sewn onto a pillow for me. Everything that John k. Butzin has learned about writing comes down to two simple words. Tom Clancy. That's write my friends. The man is a genius. Does his research. All of those nitty gritty details. Now that is writing. Why'd I come to LA? Um. Because I knew you were here and you'd lend me a hundred bucks if I asked ya, right? Right? C'mon. Thank you, babe. I already got her number. Maybe I'll text her. Maybe I won't. I don't know. I'm an optometrist in glendale. Yes he is. And I am a full time writer. Yes, you are, honey. And our last name is mooney. So you can call us moonies. We get that joke all the time. Yes, everybody says it. It's very funny. It's uh... Moonies. Right now I have two unpublished novels and I'm working on a third that I'm really excited about. It's called pizza to go. It's about a guy named Scott who meets all these interesting characters. Um, I'm pretty happy with what I've got so far. But it's only a hundred pages long right now. And I'm stuck. I haven't written in two weeks. Hannah keeps teasing me about my writers block. I think about her a lot. She's all I think about. I really want to ask her out. My latest project is called sleeping on the moon. It is about pain and rejection. And, oh... It's not about a moon. It's confusing. But actually the moon part is more of a... You know? It's not really what it is. It's not an actual... No one's sleeping on the moon. But there's a word for that. It's a um... You know? Um, um. Metaphor. That was actually crawling out of my mouth, metaphor, so... Thanks, ma. John k butzin has one agent that is very interested in roaring lion and there's a publisher up in oxnard who's reading it as we speak. Plus, there's a certain cousin who has a best friend who has a neighbor that has an in with Mr. Clint Eastwood, so it looks like roaring lion will be roaring at the I'm just not sure how the other members of the writing group are going to handle so much success by one person. I just hope they don't all turn out to be a bunch of pussies. I am here because of bukowski. Charles bukowski. Greatest writer ever. Period. LA is his town, man. I mean, if I'm going to be a writer then I need to walk in bukowski's shoes. You know? Capture and experience the plight of the working class. Colette here is the real writer. No, honey, you are. No, you are, you are. You are. I am, I am. You're right. I'm more of an idea guy. Mmhmm. You know, I get these great ideas... But I don't always follow through. You know? In a lot of things. Not just writing. I'll show you. I'll show you. Idea for romantic novel. No. Make that idea for romantic e-book. Right? It's just... you know, the times. Frovers. They couldn't be friends. They couldn't be lovers. So they became frovers. Oh my God. Honey. That just, right now that came to you? It did. It just did. Baby. I know. I love you. I'm so... It's just the idea that they couldn't, if they couldn't be this one or this one, but then you take that word, those two words and make it one. Well I didn't know we were going to do like questions. Um, I've never thought about that. Wow. Favorite. Favorite writer. Wow, that's a tough one. You know I've studied more composition over actual literature. But Ms. Maureen over here, I know she loves a writer by the name of... Jane, um... Jane? It's on the tip of my tongue. Austen. Austen. Jane Austen. That's the one. I hear she's good, so... Yeah. Go Jane, keep it up. Meet someone very special here with us today all the way from- Germany. Ah, that accent. I love it. It drives me crazy. It's so world war ii. I found her at a hardware store. Went in to buy a drill bit and came out with a prime candidate for Mrs. John k butzin the fourth. This my wall of America. And in the center, of course, is the man I admire most in America. Ya. My special guy, John butzin. Soon to become very rich. Very famous. Already very sexy. Then maybe sigrid hagenguth becomes Mrs. John k butzin. Ya? Yeah. The people in the group are great. They're ok. They can't write for shit. I do pencil and paper. Just old school- She does, yeah. Just I write down my ideas. I mean I have a lot of things. I'm juggling a lot of stories right now. One is-is about-one I can't because I'm afraid of like copyright infringement. Yeah, that's a worry that we have that if we say our material- If we say our ideas yeah, is that gonna be a problem? Oh man, that's... That's Richard broadwell. Yeah, he's a fantastic writer. He's, uh, written seven novels. I gotta a couple of them here. Yeah, right on top. Babylon express is one. Um, there's a couple more in there somewhere. Um, he's like Fitzgerald of his generation, you know? That prolific. I'm the leader, the group leader. After all, getting together was my idea. They were all my patients. That's how we met. First one published gets a free eye exam. This is where I come for inspiration. I believe that every writer needs to have a place where they can have some tranquility and peace And solitude. This is my place. I'll come here and meditate. I'll come here and write in my journal. This is where the magic happens for me. This is where I plan my creative path for the day. This is my walden pond. Why did I form the group? I wanted to help Colette. Oh, I certainly enjoy the creative process I do. But Colette? Writing is her dream. And I'd do anything for her because... Because she's my dream. My favorite author would have to be Josie dediem. Her writing sends shivers down my spine sometimes. Although, Joyce Carol oates has been known to bring me to actual orgasm. Possible names for future characters. Anthony gilmore. No, wait. Anthony t. Gilmore. Much better. Fiona fox. Slate McCoy. Fletcher peck. And a man known simply as banjo. That? Oh that's a picture of me. Yes, thank you for noticing. Yes, this a picture of me. Me inspires I and I inspires I... Me. I me. "You only fail if you stop writing." Ray Brad... bury. Tonight's the night I'm asking Hannah out. Yeah, I'm doing it. I'm doing it. It's time. I really like her, you know? And she likes me. I think. I'm getting that vibe. So, I'm doing it. It's-it's time to take action, so... I'm gonna ask her out. Hey meathead, how come we never chow down at your quarters? This is my quarters. Close to the working people. Hey, has anybody seen Hannah? Time to get started. Nope, ready to read people. Let's go. William's right. We'll start, she'll show up. William, sweetheart, aren't these the same three pages that you read last time, honey? Nope. They're different. No. They're different. I changed a word. One word? Writing is rewriting, Colette. Bukowski said it. You write five words, you rewrite seven. No, um... Dorothy Parker said that- who gives a shit who said it? One word, Jesus h Christ. It's my creative vision, John. It's how I work. Which we are here to support. Absolutely. This is William's decision. Just read it. Just read it. And tell me if you can figure out the word. And then tell me if you think it's better or worse. One goddamn word. Anyone? Flawed? Close. Oh, I got it. It was "this" last week and it's "the." Nope. Is it a noun? Yes. Oh ooh. Drink? No, that's the same. If I had a bayonet, I'd stab myself. Thank you. You're welcome exciting stuff. You guys, I wonder what happened to Hannah. It's not like her to miss. Guys, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I missed the meeting. What happened, honey? Did your car break down? Did you oversleep? Is Maureen ok? You haven't met a guy? Look at her, look at that glow. Actually I-I did meet a guy. Yes. Told ya. His name is Bryan. Get ready. He's my new agent. Ahhh. Of sleeping on the moon, and I guess my teacher really liked it, so he gave it to his friend Bryan, who happened to be an agent. He called me. He wants to sign me. I bet Bryan wants more than that. That is so fantastic. That is wonderful young lady. I solute you. Thank you! Absolutely. That's fantastic. Where's he located? Beverly hills. Is he gay? No. No. Excuse me, could you take a picture of us? Thank you so much. Everybody smile. Agent! That was cute that you said that. Why didn't anybody say agent? I thought it was a good idea. Ok. To Hannah. To Hannah! To Hannah. Thanks guys. Look, we are all in this together. Ok? I'd be nowhere without this group. All for one. Yeah. One for all. I'm merely the first one to get an agent, but we're all gonna get signed eventually. Well, as a matter of fact.. There is an agent in Santa Monica who is very, very interested in John k. Butzin. He's reading my manuscript as we speak. Yay! Hey bro, you got ten bucks I can borrow? Uh... Yeah, sure. Thanks, bro. You're the best. K, guys- congratulations again, hannnah. Way to go, Hannah. Thank you. Bye. Hannah's got an agent. Yeah, she must have slept with him. Of course she did. That really is cool, Hannah. Oh thank you. You're time will come, Henry. You're a better writer than I am. A much better writer. You went to college. Great, amazing writer Henry obert. I knew him when. Listen, I was thinking maybe some afternoon we could um... I don't know, go for a drive, or see the sights, I guess. Yeah, that would be great. You know, I've been out here four years and I still haven't seen... Oh my God. It's just been four years since I moved out here, and I just got an agent. Number four-that's my lucky number. I should have known this was gonna happen. There's nobody more deserving. I'm going to dedicate my novel to you. Good night, Henry obert. 'Night. Wow. Idea for a novel. A us senator is also a vampire. Yes. Y novel is called niet, not yet by Colette mooney. It's about a Russian woman, her story, her search for love in this country. It's inspired by a story that I heard from a massage client of mine named Yuri. Yuri. Shhh. Favorite author? Oh, that question again. I still don't have an answer. There are so many. Who would of thought that I used to do massage? I know. No, it's true. In fact that's how I met Alan for the first time. Although don't let him tell you any differently because I know that he will try. It's absolutely not true that I gave him the kind of massage that he really wanted. 'Cuz I didn't. I did not give him... At least not the first time I didn't. Absolutely. I have morals and values. Bottom line is if Hannah can get an agent, so can I. So yeah, I am superstitious. I know, I'm guilty. I'm very drawn to the number four. I was born on 4:04 pm on April fourth. Yeah, four four four four. I mean, that is not an accident. No way. Things I like to avoid. Well, black cats, broken irrors, and the number thirteen. Yes, I do not like the number thirteen. And everbody that knows me knows that I do not like the number thirteen. Even though three plus one is four. And I do like four. So it's a fine line. Everybody has a technique. And this is mine. A writer has to hear everything. On the streets. In the restaurants. My dialogue has to be so real, that I'm everywhere. Standing behind you at the check out stand. Peeing next to you at the urinal. Oh yeah. I watch. I listen. Writing down scraps of conversation. You're writing what we're saying. That's right. I eavesdrop. Gotta love it. That's me. Simple. Real. Powerful. An artist. These are my rejection letters. Rejected by agents. Rejected by publishers. When I think about it, it's kind of depressing how many ways people can reject you. This is-this is probably a rejection letter, you know? I can't do this today. I can't open this letter. I take rejection so personally. I'll bet it's good news. You think? I think. It could be. Ok I think it could be too. Because today is the day. That's the spirit. Oh. Can you read it? Uh... Sorry not interested. That's what it says, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well remember the pink one? It was way smaller than this one was. Yes, it was. It was a lot smaller. A lot smaller. I think that because it's getting bigger, it could be... Progress. Right? That's right. I'll save this one. I'm gonna save this one. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know who that could be. It's ok. Hi Maureen how are you? Hello everyone. Colette's here! Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. I didn't know they were here. Hi guys. You look so dressed up. Oh thank you. You look fantastic too. I thought I'd bring something I picked up for my new favorite author. There's a note. "Poodles, now may we have sex again?" Love Alan. What mom? That is amazing. You're welcome. Oh gosh, I know what it was. Really quick I just wanted to ask about your new agent honey. Oh, mmhmm? Is he taking on new clients? Oh, you know what, I don't know. Could you ask? 'Cuz you know? I mean if he is... You know? Yeah, maybe I could- could probably do that. Ok good. Maybe we can talk about this at the meeting? You're right. Absoultely. Absoultely. Yeah. Ok. Oh, I guess I should go. It's time. Thanks Maureen. This is so sweet. You're welcome. Everything is gluten free, because you know at our age, honey, it's time to start being healthy, right? You know? When you're young. You should start young. Ok, muah. Congratulations, sweet pea. Thank you. Bye guys, see you! Ohh. Careful there. I've not been drinking. Ohh. Too much. Haha. Ahhh. Oh my goodness. Colette mooney. She really is something. Yes. Colette mooney. That girl, she... C-o-l-l-t-t-e-m-o-o-n-e-y. That's thirteen letters. Out. Out it goes. It's ok. I'm not-Colette... She's not scary, so... Hannah. Henry. How are you? Oh, thank you for seeing me Alan. Of course. No problemo. Let's get you some new eyewear. I need something that makes me look smart. Ok. You're already smart Hannah. This will be perfect. Why don't you try these? Ok. Ehh. Nah. Excuse me one sec. Name for character. Alexander brown. Wears brown colored glasses. Well of course he would. You know this great idea for a novel came to me this morning. It's called woof. It's about... It's about a dog who becomes human for 24 hours in order to rescue his kidnapped owner. Hannah, I love this idea. Could be a winner. Yeah, you think so? Do you like these? You look great. Do you think you're agent might be interested in this idea? Does he have a dog? Or a cat. It could be a cat. We could call it meow. Just think about mentioning it to him, ok? Dog or cat becomes human. I brought you out here because I would like you to meet someone who is super duper important to me. He is my spiritual advisor. Dr. xiroman has taken a year's vow of silence to protest climate change. It's just amazing. He's here today to cleanse the air of this icky, icky negative rejection energy air. So please. Mm mm. There's a lot more air, so you can keep going. That's it? Hello? Oh hi! It's Bryan. Yes, I'm sitting down. What? Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God. Are you serious? He sold my novel. Oh! Shhhh. Oh my God, I'm here, yes. How much? Wow, ok great. Ok, ok, we'll talk tomorrow. Ok, thanks Bryan. Oh! Wow, Hannah. Well, we gotta tell the group. Oh no, no, no. I don't want to do that. It'll sound like I'm bragging. And I already got the agent. Why don't you let me tell them? Yeah, yeah, you know, they'll hear it from me first, and it won't be a thing. Thank you, Henry. What would I do without you? Her and her little book deal and all. But it just so happens that John k butzin has some news of his own to announce. I have just inked a deal with "u r the publisher". A reputable firm based in... Well it's overseas. But they publish 5,000 titles a year. I'm going to give them $250. They're gonna format and publish my novel roaring lion. Next step, Hollywood. Hannah's just lucky. That's all. Guys, here she comes. Here she comes. Get ready, get ready. Surprise! Ohh! So sweet! Really? Oh that's so sweet, you guys. Thanks. First one published gets a free eye exam. Thank you so much. Wait to go, miss published author. Thank you. Big hug there. We're all jealous Hannah. Just teasing you. No seriously, we're all jealous. Look, you guys are making way too much of this. Really. So when does the book come out? A year. They said about a year. How much you get? Don't ask her that. Why not? How much do you get? Uh, actually I did ok. Yeah? Yeah, just leave it at that. But hey, I owe all of this to you guys. I'd be so lost with out this group. I don't know if anybody heard, but "u r the publisher" has decided to publish roaring lion by John k butzin. "U r the publisher"? That's right. Self publishing. E-books. They print on demand. Yes, that's right. That's exactly what they do. And I'll have my book in two weeks. None of this waiting around crapola. John k butzin will be a published author. And he'll be published first. John, congratulations. Right back at ya, kid. Two published authors in the group. The rest of us are gonna have to catch up. Just- gunner stared out over the bleak horizon seeing one dead Vietcong after another. They scattered on the bloody hillside. He had won this time. But gunner knew that Charlie would be back in the morning. And by God, he would be ready. And so would his m60 general purpose machine gun, and mark 2 fragmentation hand rifle grenade. God, that's good stuff. That's beautiful. Nicely done, John. Let's get some feedback. Ok, well I think in terms of characters, John- hold on a minute. I want to hear from her. No I don't wanna hear from everyone. I want to hear from Hannah. She has a book coming out. John k butzin has a book coming out. I want to hear from Hannah. Author to author. Screw you. Really? This is really against the spirit of the group, John. Everyone's opinion is valid. Hers is more valid. What do you say, Hannah? Um... I... I'm going outside. I should probably go check on him. Make sure that he is ok. Let's take a fifteen minute break, shall we? Yep. I'm just gonna go to the restroom. You guys need anything else? Idea for Michael crichton - type novel. Members of antarctic research station attacked by mutant penguins. Wait a minute, what was that? Uh, just an idea I was working on. Just uh- who was that author? Michael crichton. Michael chrichton. Pretty well known author. Just members of a research team attacked by mutant penguins. Really? We have one rule in this house. Whatever Colette wants, Colette gets. Aw thank you, honey. If she wants an audi s4, no problem. I did, I did. Credit cards? How many? Her own business? Done. An agent? Call it serendipity, karma, whatever. But it just so happens that very well known literary agent David kelleher- so known. He is so known. I just- And guess who's coming in tomorrow to see doctor Alan mooney for an eye exam and new glasses? It's not me. It's Donald. Callahan-no, David? Kelleher. David kelleher. David kelleher. Anyway what am I supposed to say to her? Oh Christ, he says it's pedantic. Dr. Alan mooney. I'll call you back. I'll call you back. I know. Big fan. Big fan. Come with me, please. They're doing a little documentary about my writing group. Really? Just act natural. So David, what brings you hear today? Near sighted, far sighted. I do need a prescription on the reading. Ok focus on the "e" for me there. Obviously you read a lot. I know that. You've been getting any headaches? No. Let's see here. Let's see here. Ok let's do a basic eye examination. Read that first line for me please, David. L-b-h-k-z-b-c But anyone can identify simple letter and numbers. Let's see how you do reading a more challenging text. Natasha the Russian peasant dressed oh so slowly. Consumed totally, completely, absolutely by endless thoughts of Yuri. Wow. Isn't that great writing? My wife collete wrote that. The patients just love reading it. It's from her new novel niet, not yet. I wonder who that could be. Hi honey. Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to intrude. Oh gee Colette. This is a huge coincidence. We were just talking about you and here you are. Where are my manners? Colette, David kelleher. David, Colette mooney, the writer. Oh my goodness, it is such a pleasure, David. Actually Colette is the one who wrote this beautiful prose you've been reading. Honey, I can't believe this coincidence. Yes, I was just dropping the- oh yes, thank you. Thank you for dropping that buy. Say honey, David has just been reading the first page of yours. You wouldn't happen to have any more of that opening chapter would you? We're in luck because I think- say, how 'bout that? Hey. How 'bout that? Woah that went very well. Yes, poodles very. Although he did seem in a hurry to leave, didn't he? The sooner he can begin reading. I'm holding a copy of my book that you people sent me, and there seems to be some kind of a mistake. Well, you put a dog on the front cover, instead of a lion like we agreed upon. Right. And let me tell ya something else. The back page is in Chinese. Yes, it's Chinese. I know Chinese when I see it, ok? A Chinese assault rifle almost cost me an eye at hamburger hill so I know Chinese when I see it, alright mister? This is good, Henry. This is so good. Yeah, you think so? Oh yeah. Do you think it's ready for the group? I can't wait to hear what happens with Scott and kristy. Those are such great characters oh thanks. Thanks. Yeah, I can't wait to see what happens with them too. Oh Henry, you'll figure it out. Hey, uh... you want to take that drive we talked about? I um... I could use some inspiration. And what in the h-e-double hockeysticks is chapter eight? I mean, this-this is about hormone replacements for women, and yeast infections, and braziere sizes and feminine washes... How the hell am I supposed to show this to Mr. Clint Eastwood? And I want to know what the hell you are gonna do about it, ok? Because you sir are dealing with a decorated veteran. A decorated combat vet- yes, I'll hold. I have to iron out of a few things. Very common in the publishing world. What really matters here is that John k butzin is finally a published author. Long overdue and well deserved. Because- butzin. John k butzin. So who lives here? Richard broadwell. Oh, the writer you like. Reading Richard broadwell makes me want to be a better writer. He's that good. I haven't really read any of this stuff, but nice house. Well here we are. North Hayworth Avenue, Hollywood California. Ok, big clue time. Sheilah Graham. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. Sheila Graham. Wow. Right. Who was Fitzgerald's lover. And Fitzgerald died right here on December 21st, 1940. Wait, wait wait. Fitgerald? He's the one who shot himself, right? No. Fitzgerald. F. Scott Fitzgerald. He wrote the great gatsby. Come on, you know. Gatsby. He believed in the green life. The orgiastic future. The year by year- I didn't read it. Come on. Can we just, like, turn these off for a second? Why? What's wrong? I just... I have never read the great gatsby. Henry, I didn't go to college, ok? I mean, I've heard of Hemingway and twain, somewhere, but I don't have the smarts and the education that you do. I haven't read all these incredible novels. My stories, they just come from my heart. So tell me about this book. Gatsby is about social position. It's about the American dream. How um... Actually it's really simple. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. And boy tries to move heaven and earth to win girl back. And it's your favorite? So how does it end? Does boy get girl? I'll give you my copy. You can find out for yourself. Thank you. You're welcome. Gatsby. Great book. Classic. See. Oh my gosh. I really needed this break. Thank you, Henry. Oh no problem, no problem. It was a lot of fun. I'm beginning to feel a lot of pressure. There's a lot riding on this first book. You know, riding, not writing. There's obviously writing. There's a lot of words I have to write. Hannah, the book's going to be great. Sleeping on the moon is going to be a huge hit. You're going to be the toast of the literary world, and I will come to your big mansion in Beverly hills and deliver you pizza. Beverly hills, I wish. It's gonna happen. You're sweet. It was such a fun day. Yeah, it was really fun. And this is awesome. You're going to enjoy that. I promise. You're the best, Henry. Um... No distractions. Writing comes first, ok? Yeah. Ok. It was the best day. See ya. Ok. Alright, who's turn is it to read? Henry? Oh um no... Thanks, I don't have anything new tonight. So somebody else can go ahead. I changed them again and uh, I'm just not ready, so... But Henry honey it's been weeks. I know guys, and I'm really sorry. I just can't seem to get it focused and on the page. Come on obert, don't be such a tool. Get to writing. John, he has writer's block. What's so hard, bro? You've got two characters. Scott and kristy. Well that's kind of the problem. I think the story is changing. Changing? How so? Lately I've been feeling like there's something much richer and deeper there, like um... Scott and kristy becoming closer. Henry, kristy is a wealthy, beautiful Beverly hills author, I mean how much closer can they get, honey? Ok... but uh follow me, if you guys can. Let's just say something happens. And it forces kristy into an epiphany where she realizes that her feelings run much deeper now for Scott than she first realized. Nah, don't buy it. Is this Scott who is wanting this relationship to go farther? Because I honestly... Maybe it's just me... But I can't see kristy being the one to... Hannah hon, I mean, girls point of view, what do you think? Wow, I guess I never thought of them that way. Never? No. I think it's always been a friendship, so... Nothing more. Exactly. Ok. Uh. I'll, uh, try to have something new on paper for next time. Wait, what? I had some extra. Ok wait, how much? See ya. Bye John! Five hundred? Ok, but if I loaned you that money, than I wouldn't have it. I just thought since you got that big advance, you know, you could help a fellow writer out. I'm good for it, Hannah, of course. I know, it's just... It's bad luck to loan money. So than just give it to me. William... Thank you so much, Hannah. Thanks, Colette. Thanks for coming. Absolutely ok, we'll see you next week. How much do you need William? Five thousand. Ok. Poodles. Thanks for, uh, everything. Today is a big day in my life. Roaring lion is being posted on Amazon. Com. Now all books, your fiction, your nonfiction, they're all ranked by sales. Obviously everybody wants to be number one. But they say that a book is selling well on Amazon if it's in the top five thousand. Sigrid honey, it's time to run it up the flagpole. Two million, four hundred, seventy two thousand, eight hundred, and ninety-nine. Tom Clancy. Thirty-two. How am I doing? I'm ok, I guess. There's a lot of interest for the movie rights for sleeping on the moon, so yay! Oh no, I don't dare tell the group. If they find out about the movie deal, I don't know. I'm just sensing a little jealousy already, so it could be kind of awkward if they found out. Please come home, Michael. Why would you want to marry me, kyra? I barely graduated high school. Michael, I don't care about some silly college degree. You are the most intelligent person I've ever known. You are my shining star. Ok, uh... Comments? Anyone? Come on guys. I really value your opinions. I mean we're all in this together, right? So, Colette, did the new scene work for you? The new scene? It um... Uh, well gee... This is being published. This is gonna be published. Well my editor needs rewrites, so am I on the right track, or? Of course you are, Hannah. Of course you're on the right track. Yeah. I mean, you got the deal, you got the check. You're the first one to be published so... You know, I think what I'm hearing from the group is that you're fine. We love it. There's just nothing to critque here. You don't need us... Oh yes I do. I mean you need us, but in terms of... I'm just not sure how we would make it better. Oh um... Henry? Yeah. A little quiet over there. What do you think of it? Actually I think that it's really good. It's great. Um, there are a couple things that I would point out. Little things, like for instance- holy Douglas mccarther. John, Henry was talking. Hollywood decides to go sleeping on the moon. First time scribe Hannah rinaldi prepped by soho has just thanked a six figure movie deal. Meant to tell you that today, so... Just forgot. Thanks John. Six figures. Wow. Idea- Idea for novel. Perhaps screenplay. The amazing doctor ecklebert. Eye doctor turned crime fighter. Ladies man. William? Alan, hey. I just stopped by to read some of Colette's pages. Swing time, baby- hi poodles, what are you doing home? William, what are you doing here? Alan, baby, it's just research. Poodles! Hannah's been avoiding me. She's not responding to emails or voice messages. She's always really busy these days. Always has an excuse. Things have definitely changed between us. Though I did get to go over to her house for dinner. She was in New York with her publisher, but Maureen and I had a lovely time. Yes, you noticed I replaced my photo. I may be replacing other things here soon. I was simply using William for research. I mean, you saw... you know... And speaking of rejection three more letters saying niet. Niet. Niet. Niet. Oh, including one from David kelleher. David kelleher. I knew I should have given him a massage. Once again I was wrong. What a surprise. Huh? Rejection sucks. It sucks! This is a big day for John k. Butzin. Yes. It's my first official book signing. Of course it would've been better if it was held at an actual bookstore, but let's face it, they're dropping faster than Charlie at dak to. Since sigrid works at a hardware store, they're gonna let her favorite author sign a few books. More than a few books. Many, many books ya? Ya strudel. Many, many books. Attention shoppers. Famous author Mr. John k butzin signing new best seller at front of store. John k butzin. Also special today in plumbing department. Ballcocks, two for one. All customers guaranteed for to be satisfied, ya. Oh, sorry. Sorry, strudel. Looks like John k butzin is shooting blanks today. Author, author! There he is! Look at this. The cavalry has arrived. Congratulations. Thank you. John, we would never miss your signing. Congratulations, John. Book signing! Thank you. What a nice surprise this is. Where's the, uh, bukowski wanna be? I think he's gonna... he said he'd meet us later. Kids a big turd anyway. Never cared for him. Maybe he is. Maybe I should go check. Maybe you should. This is in Chinese. Hmm? Oh, the international edition, ya. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh... We're breaking with that first. Oh wow. Is this a dog? Because it's a lion in the title... You see in the particular province in China where we're breaking... The dog replaces the lion. Oh, of course. Alan, open the champagne. Come on. You can open it any day now. Yep. I'm right on that honey. That hardware store manager told me that today was their most successful book signing ever. I don't know how many other book signings they've had, but he says mine was the most successful. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Eleven books- She used one to prop open the door. Ten books. Ten books. That means there's ten families in California who have books written by melville, Hemingway, Clancy, and butzin. It's a humbling thought. I've made an important decision as group leader. I've decided to ask William to leave the group. Now it has absolutely nothing to do with that incident at our house. I believe Colette. I believe William. It has nothing to do with the fact that I'm now sleeping in my guest room. Let's face it. The kid's a slacker. No contribution to the group. Zero. Zip. Nada. I'm sure he'll be fine with it. There's no need to be so upset. Fine. I was gonna quit anyway, ya bunch of losers. With your stupid recorder, and your stupid ideas, and your stupid character names. And you. Gi Joe over here. With your self published piece of crap. When are you gonna realize nobody's gonna make a movie out of roaring lion? Just ignore him. And you know what... The great Henry o. Man, you got the gift bro. The only problem is you've got your head so far up your ass over sweet, successful Hannah here... Lucky Hannah. I'm just as good a writer as you are. But you sure do look good in a mini skirt, don't ya? Hey, that's enough. I don't need any of you. I don't need any more of your pitiful pedestrian feedback. You've got three goddamn pages. And they are great three goddamn pages. You just don't appreciate my dedication. You are a pretend writer, William. She's right. You act the part. You hit on women, and you quote bukowski. But people like bukowski do the work do the work. They write. Every day they write. And that's your problem. You don't do the work. I don't do the work? Man, that sounds fricking hilarious coming from you. When was the last time you wrote anything? Hey guys. Not the sign! Oh! Angry young man. Oh, Alan. Ok, uh... Moving on. Next item. Richard broadwell is going to be doing a book signing next Saturday. Who wants to go? I'll go. Alright. Idea for novel. Jealous husband murders tramp of a wife and buries her chopped up body in the backyard. Mr. broadwell, I just... Wanna say that. Mr. broadwell, you've inspired my writing. Hi, I'm Henry. I just think you're the greatest- Henry. Henry, let me tell you something. Ok? One day, I'm going to have a book signing just like this. No, I will not be going to that book signing for Richard whatever his name is, ok? No. John k butzin, author, doesn't stand in lines. No. This- this soon to be best-selling author, is spending every minute, every nickel that he has on promoting his own book, roaring lion. Thank you. Strudel, would you check my sales ranking, please? One million, six hundred, and forty-four thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three. That's great. I mean look at how far I've moved up already. Tom Clancy. Twelve. Next please. What's your name? What? Sir, your name? Henry. Henry. What? Absolutely not. I'll sue the bastard first. Thank you. Yeah, are you kidding me? Sir, come on, we've got to keep the lining moving. Sir, move the line along. Thank you, sir. I'm Alan mooney. Thank you. You completely cut me in line. What's your name? Hi, my name's Colette. C-o-l-e-t-t-e. Negative. No, you're done, thank you. Next please. No, no, no! Damnit, you don't- Hannah. I've got to call you back. Hi. Hello. Hannah? Yes. I'm actually a writer. Ahh I knew that. You did? How did you? Is it the glasses? 'Cuz they're new. It was also, you're giving off a very creative energy. You know my pen began to vibrate. I think that was part of it. That's so sweet. Hey. What'd he say? Who? You know the guy that just held up the line for five minutes while he was talking to you. It was ten. It was closer to ten. Oh, no. It was nothing. We just talked. He sure seemed to like you. Look, I told him about my book, and he started asking questions. Kind of writer to writer. Talking to Richard broadwell was no big deal? Really? You gave him your phone number. You guys, look, he reads more books in a week than Why would he ever bother to call me? Hello? Who? Richard? Hi. Oh my God. Did she say Richard? Yeah. Really? Coffee? I really appreciate the invitation but it's not really a great time, so... Um, yeah you could call me later. I will think about it, yes. Oh my God. Ok, bye. That's amzaing. This is unfair. This is just... not fair. First you get an agent, and then the book deal, and then the big movie- please darling- no, it's not fair. And now Richard... What's his name? Broadwell wants to have coffee with you. This happened to you and only to you. There's more of us here. You know, isn't there a way something, anything... A cosmic creative crumb that the rest of us I don't like what you're insinuating, Colette. You know how hard I work and how devoted I am. Plus I've been so supportive of you. I've encouraged your writing all along. But you didn't introduce you to your agent, do you remember? I asked him. He didn't want to meet you. Hannah has earned her success. Butt out, Mr. idea man. You didn't tell me that. Hannah is a writer, ok? She devotes herself %100 to writing. Not 100% to sleeping with writers. Oh dear God, it was research Alan. Guys, guys! Come on! Guys, why don't you just go on ahead? I'm just saying it's not, that's all. Just, you know, because there's more of us. I just simply wanted to say that I felt that it was unfair. Let's go, let's go. Thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen! Uf. Hi. I'm a shit for exploding at Hannah. I'm really sorry. Poor sweet, superstitious... She's so superstitious, I don't know what that is. Everybody loves Hannah. I love Hannah. She's a good girl. But you know if Hannah can do it, then so can I. You know, we were born to succeed not to fail. Who said that? I don't know. Somebody famous. Somebody with an agent. Haha. Somebody with an agent, I'm sure. And I'll tell you what. You know, I can't do anything without an agent, so if they don't come to me, then I'm going to go to them. Your writers block... Yeah? It's because you're always focused on everything else. You know? Fitzgerald. Gatsby. Me. Listen to me, Henry obert. The writing must come first. You've got to take all this passion you have and put it on the page. You know? Forget about everything else. All you're doing is wasting your talent. You know what I mean? From ze books. Wow. Do you mean that all of the books at the hardware store sold? Ya. Every one. What did I tell you, strudel? What did I tell you? If you write it, they will read it. I want you to get some more books down to that hardware store right away. No wait. Wait a minute strudel. This is the time for a book tour. A big one. Bakersfield. Fresno. Stockton. Yeah, strudel. I want you to get on the phone and I want you to call every one of those bookstores and you tell them that John k butzin, published author... Is on his way. Lock and load, strudel. Lock and load. Auf wiedersehen. Hello? Excuse me? I'm here to see Lois pepper, please? Hello? Uh yes, no. Unsolicited. Um, I just need five minutes. Just one, two, three, four, five minutes of her time. If you could just maybe lean you're head in a little bit, and say my name is Colette mooney. M-o-o-n-e-y. I have a manuscript that I know she's absolutely, positively going to want. I know she is very busy but- if I have to read one more vampire novel, I swear I'm going to drive a stake through my own goddamn heart. Vampires. Zombies. Harry Potter knockoffs. People writing about their dogs. Manuscript, and it has nothing to do with vampires or dogs- doctor xiroman, I can't believe you're here. How lovely to see you again. Were you just in the neighborhood? He has taken a vow of silence. Please, please come in for a second. My family talks about you all the time. You were so helpful to my sister. But... Oh shit. Can you believe this? Look at my desk, Dr. xiroman. Look at it. It's all crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. I hate my job. I hate my life. I envy you, Dr. xiroman. I mean look at your life. Your work. You've really helped my sister. You've helped so many people. You just have such a positive message to share. He does. Wait a minute. Positive message to share. Helping people. That's it! Dr. xiroman, you should write a book. What? My novel will have to wait a while longer. Niet, Colette, not yet. But I'll be a co-author. Well actually I'll be listed as junior author. It's not exactly what I wanted, but at least now I finally have an agent and book deal. Thank you. You're late pizza boy. Sorry. Hey, what's this? Oh don't worry about them. They're with me, so... Your total is $19.65, sir. There you go. Hey babe, you got a single for pizza boy? Coming. Thanks. Thank you. No distractions. Writing comes first. Henry, I... He is making me a much better writer. I'll bet he his. And how much better of a writer could he be making you, Hannah? Why don't you show us? Who wrote slaughter house five? Please don't do this. This could be educational for all of us. How about the native son, or catch 22. Why isn't enough that I'm your friend? Lord of the flies. Portnoy's complaint. Ooh, Harry Potter. I'll bet you know Harry Potter. Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing? Sophie's choice. Who wrote that? Published in the English language. It's just not enough that I've always believed in you. You never even read gatsby. Did you? Didn't even crack the book, I bet. Well... At least I'm not delivering pizzas for a living. So you've read all these fancy novels. My book's being published. Is yours? Sorry I'm late. What have you got there? New pages. I am ready to read. Way to go Henry. Have a seat right here. Hello everyone. Who is this guy? I have invited my spiritual advisor, Dr. xiroman, to join our writing group. You must be joking, Colette. No I'm not joking, Alan. The doctor and I will soon be published authors. We have signed with the Lois pepper agency. Yay! No, you can't do this. But why not? Because.. Since William is gone there is an open space. We all have to agree on new members. I don't care about your silly rules. I am the leader of the group. Please. I am the leader of the group! And Dr. xiroman is my co-author and he is joining the group. He is not. Yes he is. Is not. Is too. Is not! Is too! Stop! Stop! Sorry. Um, I just... I have something I need to say. Um, I'm leaving this group. No you can't leave. Hannah, come on, all for one. I know, Alan, I'm sorry. Um... Richard is going to be mentoring me now, so... And today is the twenty second, so, you know, two and two equals four and you know four is one of my luckier numbers... Oh gosh. I'm quitting this. I'm sorry, Alan. You're just doing this to upstage the fact that we've landed an agency. Yes, this is what it's all about, isn't it? The spotlight's always on little miss sunshine over here. With her agent and her book deal and her movie deal, and her new iPad. Didn't miss that! I got a news flash for all of you. John k butzin is saying sayonara. This group has done nothing but stifle the creativity of a certain writer. What's going on with you two? He thinks your writing's crap. Oh really? Oh who cares what this phony balogna whatever he is says about anything, alright? Because there is a certain Mr. Clint Eastwood. He's gonna see my writing. He's gonna see my writing when I go on the-the tour. You know what, I'm done with all of you. As far as I'm concerned, you're all a bunch of pussies. Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussies. Get out. Now. As the leader of this group, I've determined your actions are contrary to our stated purpose. Get out. You can not throw me out, Alan. Then go to your room and take him with you. Won't be the first guy. Well we certainly will have a lot to talk about You go by yourself. I am done. It's just like Alan to finish first. I told you it was simply research, poodles. I don't understand how all this could happen. Just... Idea for novel. Here, take it. Maybe you can use some of my ideas in your novel. Henry. Henry, wait. Henry, I-I wanna read that. Henry, do you think we could talk for just a second? Henry, wait! Henry, Henry. I'm sorry. Strudel shipped out. She wanted to stay, but uh... I just didn't have time for a relationship... Especially not now, you know? With the way my book is selling, you know? She uh... Well she was collateral damage. Hated it. Just hated it. What a dame. Sigrid. She had the smarts of my first wife, the body of my second, and thank God she wasn't anything like my third wife. Yeah. Yeah, I did the right thing. Yeah I did. But now, all that matters is that the roaring lion book tour is about to begin. And I can't wait to hit the road, and meet the good people of this great nation. Good American people. Isn't it exciting? Wah! I'm so nervous. It's crazy. I don't really actually know half the people here. Most of them are Richard's friends. There he is. Over there. Nobody's shown up from my old writing group. Not one. I guess I shouldn't really be surprised. I haven't heard from anyone in months. Ha. Well you just keep asking me that, don't ya? That's funny. Um... Yeah, no I still can't think of one. I'm going to go over there. Hey you. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Ok, hi, how are you? Thank you so much for coming. So sweet. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Hey. Oh my God. Hi. Henry! Oh gosh, thank you. I can't believe you came. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hi. You're the only one who came from the group. I just can't believe you came to my signing. Well it was hard to miss. With that article about you in people magazine. I just wanted to come by and, you know, see you and tell you congratulations. I'm really happy for you. Thank you. Henry. Hello, how are you? Hannah, please come back. Your public. Ok. So, I'll let you get back to it, huh? Please stay. No, Hannah, I can't. I got a date... With a flight attendant, so I shouldn't keep her waiting. Ok, well I guess you can't stay. I'm sorry. Just wait here for one second. Hold on. Oh Hannah. I want you to have this. Please take it. Thanks. Do you want to say hello to Richard? No. No. Come on Hannah. Well your public awaits. You better go greet them? Ok. Come here. You look beautiful you know. Hannah, we really do need you. Woah! Oh gosh. Richard, Henry. Henry, Richard. Big fan. Well I did it. I went to Hannah's book signing and I congratulated her. And supported her. Writer to writer. She dedicated her book to me just like she said she was gonna. To Henry obert. My forever friend. Love Hannah. It's nice. This is why I love LA. True story. A guy delivers a pizza to my house one night. The very next week my wife has someone in to clean the carpets. Guess what. Same guy. Hmm. Small world, isn't it? So we get to talking. He tells me his name's Henry, the writer, who just finished a manuscript. Offers a discount on the carpets if I'll read ten pages. Now I liked his thinking. So I read ten pages. Wow. Now I want to read ten more. Before I knew it, I'd finished the entire book. Fresh voice, interesting characters, and that ending. The washed up impotent novelist gunned down by the jealous underemployed pizza delivery man. I mean this kid nailed it. It is on the page. You know what I mean? So I want to sign Mr. Henry obert. Get pizza to go out there. I predict a best seller. Probably a movie too. I'll call him with the good news. Or maybe I'll just order a pizza. Oh thank you very much. You're welcome. F Scott Fitzgerald. Love, love, love his stuff. Yeah. You know Fitzgerald? "Gatsby believed in the green light. The orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It alluded us then, but that's no matter. Tomorrow we will run faster. Stretch out our arms further." I love that. Yeah. He died here, you know? December 21st, 1940. I go by there sometimes. The place on Hayworth? Is that weird that I do that? I don't know, people think I'm weird. No. Do you write? I'm actually thinking of joining a writing group. Imagine that. We both like Fitzgerald. So, what is this? Some sort of reality show or something? Oh um, it's a documentary. Yeah? Yeah. Wow, that's interesting. What's it about? It's about... Excuse me. Wait, wait, wait! Hi. One more thing. Remember that question you were asking me about my favorite writer, and I never had an answer. Well it turns out that I do have one. Henry obert. He is a great writer. In fact. He's a best selling author. I knew him when.
