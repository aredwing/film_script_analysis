Are you a baking wiz between the ages of 8-12. Well, MasterChef Junior baking edition is looking for you. We're now accepting recipes submissions for 2015 competition. Do you have what it takes to be a MasterChef? You should be on that show. You are one of the best bakers I know. You're just saying that because you're my Grandma. No. I'm saying it because it's true. And because I'm your Grandmother. - Can't wait to watch it though. - Mm-Hm. - So. What do you think? - Woo. If they taste as good as they smell, I would say you found a winner. I hope Mom and Dad feel the same. Bye, Grandma. See you. Scones. Yes! Thank you. - These are fantastic. - They're so good. Well. You guys deserve fresh baked scones. Have I ever told you that you're the best parents in the world. - Mm-Hm - Okay. What's up? What? Can't a girl just make breakfast for her awesome family. We're not total suckers. You know I love scones. So, honey. What is it? Okay. There might be one... teensy-weensy little thing. I need a new bike. Well, what's wrong with the bike you have? Well. Ella, Maddy and I want to sign up for the Berwick bike race at the end of the summer. And I do a lot better in the race, with a new faster, cooler bike. But new bikes are expensive. Sweetie. It's okay if you want to sign up for the race, but if you want a new bike, you're gonna find a way to pay for it yourself. But my allowance will never cover a brand new bike. How am I suppose to do that? I don't know. But I'll tell you what. I'll pay a million bucks for these. - Really? - Mm-Hm, at least. That's it. Dad, you're a genius. I got to go. Bye. I'm going to start my own baking business this summer. Oh, that's wonderful. And I wanted to know if it would be okay for me to bake in the kitchen here? Is-Is it okay? Of course it's okay. - Our kitchen is your kitchen. - Thanks, Grandpa. It makes me so happy that baking is a big part of this family. You, your Aunt Sophie. Do you ever wished that Sophie would stay here at the bakery instead of moving to Paris. No. She's got her own bakery now. I talked to her this morning and it sounds like she's getting pretty tired. The baby is due pretty soon, isn't it. Yes, it is. I wished I could help her. - Owning a bakery is tough. - But it's worth it. Right? You guys know how much I want to run this place when I'm older. Yes. If it's still standing by then. Everyday I walk in and look up to make sure the ceiling is still here. So. Tell us, Grace. Why would you like to run this bakery one day. I don't know. I... I guess it's my dream. I love baking more than anything else It's like, when I'm baking time just stops. And I'm casting some kind of spell All I have to do is follow the recipe exactly and it can make something magical happen. I love it. And I want to spend the rest of my life doing it. Oh. That's why for the business, I'm going to do a ton of research. That way, we can get started as soon as summer starts. Do your friends know that they just become your business partners. Not yet. But. They want new bikes too. So. I'm sure they'll be total psyched about it. Okay. So, what's the big news that you just had to tell us. Well. You know how we're trying to find something fun to do this summer? Wait a minute. I thought we already did. Hello! Math camp. Math camp? Multiplications and mosquitoes? No, thank you. I still say we do Art Adventure at the Wye. Those are great ideas. But. Here's an even better one. Something that'll be fun and it just might buy new bikes. Sure. We're going to start our own business. Oh. Cool! What kind of business should we do? We can tutor math. No. No more math. Oh. How about we start a dog walking service. - Great idea. - Yeah! That's not a bad idea. But. I've already figured it all out. Welcome to "The New England Cupcakery". Our new cupcake business. Uh. We don't know how to bake. I can teach you guys. Wouldn't it be easier just to walk some dogs? Come on, take a second. Picture it. Rows of cupcakes. Pink. Yellow. Rainbow frosting for birthdays. Red, white and blue for 4th of July. And, not just plain chocolate and vanilla. I'm talking butter cookies and cream. Red velvet. The possibilities are endless. A delicious wonderland of cupcakery goodness. So? - Okay! - Okay! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! But,guys. Wait. There's one more thing and it's super important. If we're gonna do this, we have to do it right. What do you mean? Well. There maybe like... a thousand different ways to frost a cupcake, but there's only one right way to bake one. And everything has to be perfect. So, we need to follow the recipe exactly. That's how baking works. This cupcake... is so GOOD! Grace, you are a genius. These are going to make us a fortune this summer. - Yeah! - Hey! What is all this racket. Sorry, we don't want to scare off customers. Don't worry about that. There aren't any to scare off. Why aren't there any customers? - It's just been a bit slow. - Oh. Ah. This the cupcakes, beautiful. Right. We're going to be gazillionaires. I'm so proud of you girls for getting the business going. It brings me back when we first opened this place. I still can't believe that it's almost 40 years since our very first customer. I wonder who our first customer will be. Already on it. I've got the perfect place for us to get a ton of sales. Run, Tommy. Run! WILDCATS - REDS Okay, guys. This is it. The grand opening of The New England Cupcakery. We're gonna have fun but remember this is serious business. - Got it. - Got it. Now let's go sell some cupcake. - Yeah! - Yeah! Okay, Josh just texted. The Reds won. The Wildcats lost. Here they come. Great job, guys. You should celebrate. A team as awesome as you deserve a double chocolate chip. Is she selling cupcake? Or maybe vanilla with strawberry frosting. You're gonna love them. Come get your cupcake. Hey, Wildcats. Sorry you lost. I guess, the best team doesn't always win. Maybe a double chocolate chip cupcake would cheer you up. - What do you say, guys? - Yeah, let's do it. Guys! Wait. Just try them. If you're not happy, you'll get your money back. Yes! Heh heh. Hope you enjoy it. We're gonna have our new bike in no time. Nothing can stop us now. Paris? What do you mean we're spending this summer in Paris? The doctor put Aunt Sophie on bed rest until the baby comes. So, she needs us to come and help. Wait, I thought you'll be excited, it's Paris. It's just... Maddy, Ella and I just had this incredible day and we made a ton of money to buy new bikes. I think this cupcake thing could really be a big success for us. I'm sorry, honey. But with Aunt Sophie stuck at home, Uncle Bernard really needs an extra set of hands in their ptisserie. That's french for bakery. Imagine how much fun it would be to be with a master pastry chef. It does sound pretty great. But, Maddy and Ella are going to be so bombed we can't do our business. Paris. That's amazing. Why do you look so bombed? Because, bombed that we won't be able to earn money for new bikes. Why can't we? You guys don't know how to bake. So, we'll do something else. Like... Dog walking. I'm pretty good at wrangling dogs. - What do you think, Ella? - Oh my gosh, yeah! Well. I mean. Of course it wouldn't be as much fun without you, Grace. You know that. But, I'm the organized one who does the research. How are you guys going to run things without me? Holdup. What're you saying? Not-Nothing. I didn't mean... You think we can't handle it on our own. - I didn't say that. - You didn't say it. - But I think you meant it. - You're taking this all wrong. Yeah. Because everything we do is wrong unless Miss Perfect is in charged. Wait. Now, Maddy. Maybe she didn't... Didn't what? Think we'll be totally lost without her? I think we're gonna be just fine this summer, without her help. Guys. Wait, guys. - It's alright, Grace. - It's fine. Have fun in Paris. I wish we could go. Please send us lots of pictures of our new grandbaby, okay. I will. - Bye, Dad. - Bye bye. Grandma and I have a surprise for you. Grandma gave me a charm bracelet on my first big trip, and we thought... You should have one of your own. You can get some charms in France and bring back memories. Thank you. I love it. Guess we're all set. - Bye, Mom. - Bye bye. Good bye, Grace. Welcome to Paris. Quickly, they arrived. Quick - Hello. - Bernard. So glad you're here. Bonjour. - How's Sophie? - Upstairs. And she's, how you say, bored out of her mind. - Oh. That sounds like my little sister - Yeah. And this is Grace. Grace, this is your uncle Bernard. - Hello, Grace. Hello. - Hello. Hi. Grace, I want you to meet your cousin. Sylvie. I think you 2 will have a lot of fun this summer. Huh. - Bonjour. - Bonjour, Grace. I am screaming to meet you. I think you're trying to say that. - You are happy to meet her, no? - Yes. Why? What did I say? You said that you're screaming to meet her. As you, American say, "No biggie". Right? No biggie. Okay, let's go. Sophie. Ha-ha-ha. Ah! Oh, Karen. Look at you. - Oh, my little sis. - You look gorgeous. Grace! - I miss you. - You too. Thank you so much for coming to help. Hey, Grandma and Grandma said you're becoming quite the baker. Well. I learn everything I know from them. Me too. Hey. Is the oven still on the fritz? - On the fritz, yes. - Oh. They had the same equipment since they opened that place. Well, you're in for quite a treat at the ptisserie then. I can't wait. When can I start. Whoa-whoa-whoa. We work tomorrow, huh. But for now, we relax and get settle. - Yeah, okay. - Sylvie. Would you like to show your cousin to you room? Oui, Papa. I sleep. You sleep. Great. Thanks. So. Are you excited about getting your baby sister? Baby sister? Je Ne comprends pas. Okay... Mom. I need the other adapter to charge my iPad. It's in my purse, sweetheart. - Did you find it? - Yeah, I got it. So. How're you feeling about today? Awesome. I can't wait to help out at the ptisserie. And, Uncle Bernard seems really nice. Hello. You're a cute little thing. Come here. Come here, doggie. Come here. Huh? Why won't it come? Well, that's a french bulldog. Probably doesn't speak English. Then again, maybe it does. Okay. We're on Rue de Lappe. So. If my estimates are right The ptisserie should be... - There it is. - Oh. Alright. Woww. Oh, my goodness. - Let's go. - Okay. I seriously want everything in that case, right now. You have to fight me for it first. Oh, hello. - Hello, hi. - Hi. How are you? Welcome. - Hello, Grace. - Hello. Come. Come with me. So. How do you like my little place. - Wow. - It's incredible. The pastries. The cakes. The smell. It's like I've step inside an eclair. I see. Grace, I'm glad you're here. - Sylvie, come here. - Sylvie, you're here. She will show you the kitchen now. Come, please. Wow. Look at this mixer. - Pretty great, no? - Yeah. Colette, this is my cousin, Miss Grace. Oh. Nice to meet you, Grace. I'm Colette. Bernard ptisserie's intern. Great to meet you too. - So. What're you making? - Tarte Tatin. Aww. Can I help? You know tarte Tatin. Not exactly. But... it looks just like a pineapple upside down cake. Bake, flip and voil! Tarte Tatin upside down cake. Right? Yes. It sounds much the same. But. Mr Bernard is particular and... - I'm not sure if he would want... - I totally get it. But... Don't worry. I love to have things done the right way too. And beside. I really want to show Uncle Bernard how much I can help. That's why I'm here. Right? Mm-Hmm. No. No, but... You haven't even tasted it. I do not need to taste. At least just take a little bite. Please? Okay. Hmm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. No. But. I made it the same way I made my pineapple upside down cake. And everyone loves my pineapple upside down cake. No. Not everyone. Listen to me, Grace. Your cake, too dry. The sugar, too much. And the apples too saggy. Is this the Tarte Tatin you made, Colette? Oui, Mr Bernard. Taste Colette's. It's... pretty good. I guess. It is a perfect balance of heavy and light. Not what your Tatin taste like. In my bakery, we must strive for perfection at all times. I understand. But. Don't worry, Grace. French's standards of baking are very high. Not everyone can master them. But, I still need your help. Could you please refill the napkin holder out front. - Napkins? - Mm-Hm. What if I help roll tarte crust doughs,I mean... It's as easy as pie. Oh. OH... I'm so... sorry. I guess. I'll go... ...refill the napkin holders. It would be nice. Thank you. And I don't see why they say a pie in the face is funny. It isn't funny at all. Oh, honey. I'm sure Uncle Bernard knew it was an accident. - My whole day was an accident. - Oh. If I'm not good enough to help in his bakery, then how would I ever be good enough to run my own bakery. Hey. Do you know how Julia Child is the most famous female chef in the world? Yeah. Everyone knows that. But, did you know that when she first enrolled in the Cordon Bleu that she was put in the housewives class? She showed everyone how skilled she was and finally they had to take her seriously. I know you wanted to show Bernard what you could do, but... Maybe, you could look for ways to help him. If you do that. He'll see what you're capable of. Thanks, Mom. Your right. That's my girl. So. What do you say we do something to cheer you up. Yes. Come on, come on. Lean in. - Hi. - Hi. - Aww. - Ahh. - Feel better? - Definitely. I'm gonna to call Maddy and Ella as soon as we get back. I think, things are really looking up. - Hey, guys. - Hey, Grace. Look, we started our own business. - Washing dogs? - Yeah. Washing them, grooming them. Putting little bows in their hair. And, we're called... "The Bentwick Paw Spa. " Wow. That's... a really great idea. So. Are you guys having fun? Aw! Oh my gosh. No-no-no. Wait. Stay there. - Sorry. Wait. - Sorry, Grace. We got to go. Yeah, bye. Talk to you later. - Bye. - Bye! Bye. I... ...miss you. - Papa. - Mm. Do you want to play cards? I'm sorry, but I have to read this. And I have to check the inventory for the patisserie... Now, what? Yes, hello. No. No. I have to take this call. Ask Grace if she wants to play with you. I'll play, Sylvie. No, thank you. I don't want to play anymore. Sylvie can be shy. Are you 2 getting along okay? It's just hard since she doesn't speak English. Yes, she does. Sylvie studies English at school. Seriously? Sylvie. Come quick. Your Dad just won a million euros in the lottery. What are you talking about? A- ha! You totally speak English. Have you been pretending not to, just you won't have to talk to me. Because, that's kind of lame. So what? I didn't know what to say to you. Well. It would have been nice to know that you didn't know what to say to me. It would have been nice? You know what would have been nice? It would have been nice if I have space in my own room. If you had moved your books, off my desk, and put them on the bookshelf. That, would have been nice. Also, it would have been nice if you had put your clothes on your side of the closet instead of all over the room. That would certainly have been nice. Oh, and one more thing. You have too many shoes! Well. I guess you figured out what to say to me after all. Hello Madame, bonjour, would you like to try a macaron? That one is coffee flavored. If you go inside, you'll find many delicious things to enjoy. Merci beaucoup. - Bonjour. - Bonjour. No wonder this place is always packed. I wish my grandparents have half as many customers. Advertising is important. You can make delicious food but if no one knows about it, what is the point. Right. So, um. Say, Uncle Bernard. I know I really didn't make a great first impression with my baking, but... I was hoping that I could just... Just a moment, Grace. Excuse me. TIphone. You see that man? His name is Jean-Luc Pernaud. He runs that hotel. One of the best in the city. Non. Non. Oui. Madame. I would love to do business with him. I tried to meet with him many time. But he gets his dessert from the biggest fanciest bakery in all of Paris. And... I am just a local patisserie. Well, c'est la vie. Girls. I need to go meet the supplier. Let's hope this is fast. I have a very big order for berry tart to fill today. Be good, yeah! What are you doing? I'm helping Uncle Bernard fill his berry tart order. Oh. I know he likes things in the kitchen. So, let me put the souffl in the oven and... I help you. I know that you guys think that I can't help with the baking, but... I can. - Shh. - Shhh. The souffl. It is very delicating and and any noise will make it fold. And if it does, I am most dead. Listen. I blew the tarte Tatin because it was my first time making it. But these Berry tarts are right up my alley. I'm going to show him what I can do. Oh. Aww. No-no-no... Grace! - Whooa! - Aw! Oh non! Heh! Aww! What's going on here? What's going on here? Look. Look at this mess you made. It's a disaster. It's a disaster! What? la farine? Le Ce... The souffle. It was so embarrassing. I was trying to help Uncle Bernard when he left, by making tarts. I made a big mess of everything. Did he ask you to make the tarts? No, but... Like you said. I need to find ways to help him. You need to let Uncle Bernard tell you what he needs help with. Maybe instead of trying so hard to show him what you can do, you can try and learn from him. Learning to do things the way Bernard wants them may be the best way to help him. Okay. Alright. Come on. You know what? It's gonna be a good day. Hey, look. Hello. Come here. Come here. Come on. Come here. Oh. Did you want some? Sit. The dog got skills. Come here. Come here. Come here. I'm gonna call you, Bonbon. Just like the candy. Hard on the outside. Inside, really sweet. I like to show Grace the Eiffel Tower. I promise her. I know, but are you sure this is a good idea. I'm going crazy all cooped up - I... - The doctor lifted my bed rest. - You okay with this, Bernard? - You mustn't worry. The doctor is on speed dial. The hospital right at the back. I have everything under control. Okay. But the minute Sophie gets tired, we're leaving, okay? That's not funny. - I'll be fine, don't worry. - Okay. Hey, guess what? We're going to the Eiffel Tower. This could be a chance for you and Sylvie to have some fun together. - Maybe. - Good, let's go. My Mom said that Gustave Eiffel designed this tower for the World's Fair in 1889. Just think. All these years later, we get to stand here and enjoy the view. Yes, it is pretty. But I have it seen it already. Many times before. Well, maybe so, but... If I was lucky enough to see this whenever I wanted, I never get tired of it. Bernard, I'm having the baby. Yes, my chri. I know. We're having a baby. No, I mean I'm having the baby right now. Okay, I see. You're having the baby... - You are having the baby right now? - I'm having the baby right now. - We are having the baby. - Girls, let's get Aunt Sophie downstairs. Everyone out of the way. I'm having a baby. No, I'm not having a baby. The baby and my wife are having the husband. I mean... I'm the baby and my wife is having a husband. No... I'm the husband and my wife is having a baby! Why am I telling you this? You are not the baby. Out of my way. I have everything under control. Let's go. - Oh. - Oh. - Just keep breathing. - I'm breathing. Not you, Sophie. You're right. Sophie. - Are you comfortable, my chri? - I'm fine. I just need to get to the hospital. Now! - Which way? - My way! No, my way. - The road is wider. - There is construction. - No, they finished that last week. - Alright.. No one is having the baby here. My way or the high way, buddy. We should go her way. Wait. Wasn't that the hospital? Stop! Girls. Wake up, wake up. Guess what? The baby's here. Hi. Hi, girls. There she is. Meet Lily. Lily. Pretty name. She's so small and make all the noises. She sounds like a new born puppy. Sylvie. Do you want to hold her? Non. I'm too nervous. You don't have to be nervous. I'll hold her. Hi. Hello. You ready? Now make sure you support her head. Here we go. You got her. Wow-ow-ow. I've never held a baby this small before. A perfect little angel. Oh... Not again. When will this night ever end? She's finally asleep. Shh... Good morning. Be very quiet, she is sleeping. How can something so tiny be so loud. But she is a sweet one. I'm going back to bed. Sylvie, you woke the baby. Sylvie. Sylvie? It was me. I was so tired, I bumped into Sylvie and made her dropped her book. I'm sorry. It's okay. Just try and be a little more careful next time, okay. Why did you do that for me? I... hasn't been... ...very nice. I know. But. We're family. And with family, even if you don't always get along. you always have each other's backs. That means help each other out. Sylvie. What's wrong? This has been hard for me. The baby. You. - Jes... Now, what did I do? - No. Scratch that one. I mean. A few years ago, my mother died, and there is just me and Papa. 2 of us. Now, nothing is the same. I'm sorry Sylvie, that must be hard. Especially with all these new people around. And one of them is sharing your room. That's okay. I should not blame you. You and your mother came to help. I get things are different with the new baby and stepMom. But, just think. You get like... a bonus family, right? Like, my grandparents. Now, they are your grandparents too. That sounds nice. But for my Papa, I always feel like I'm in his way. I know all about being in his way. You are good baker, do not be scared of him. Underneath, he's just a big puppy dog. Oh no. Not again. Kid's got a set of lungs. Yeah. This worked. I cannot believe the baby sleep for 4 hours last night. It is a miracle. And I can't believe that 4 hours of sleep feels like a miracle. I know. I feel sorry for Papa. He's so tired, and there's so much to do. I know. I wish there is some way we can help him more. Bonbon. Hi! - You know this little cher. - He comes by sometimes. I call it, Bonbon. Wait a second. I just thought of the perfect way to help your Dad. How? I'm going to get that guy to sell Bernard's pastries in his hotel. Grace, it must be that lose sleep makes you crazy. Papa has been trying to talk to Monsieur Pernaud about that for a long time. If we can just get Jean-Luc to try one of you Dad's amazing macarons, he'll change his mind. You really think we can do it? Definitely. Look out, Monsieur Pernaud. Prepare to meet your baker. Excuse me. Could I speak to Mr. Pernaud, yours please? Please. Yeah. What she said. I'm sorry, but Mr. Pernaud is too busy. He said Monsieur Pernaud is too busy. Um For how long will he be busy? For a very very long time. Well... That's alright. We don't mind waiting, if you could just show us where to stand. But, of course. Follow me. You can wait here, as long as you like. Come on. Okay. Now, it's on. Let's go. Follow me. Now! Looks like the coast is clear. Now, all we have to do is find Monsieur Pernaud's office. Hm. Sylvie. I think it's time we give Bonbon a bath. What is this? M. Pernaud Oh. Hello, yes. Bernard here. Who's speaking. Oh. Hello, Jean-Luc. Yes, how are you? Yes. Thank you, thank you. Um-hum. Yes. Yes. What? How's that? A dog? A dog in your hotel? Oh oh. Do you think we are in trouble? What if Jean-Luc is mad about Bonbon. Thank you. Thank you, Jean-Luc. Let's just... hope he's a dog person. That was Mr. Pernaud. He was calling to inform me that 2 girls and a dog took quite a stand today. Uncle Bernard, we were just trying to help. And you did. Jean-Luc wants me to provide all of the desserts for his annual Bastille Day party. - What's Bastille Day? - It's like French' 4th of July. The party is next weekend and it is a big order. - Okay. - I will need a lot of help from everyone. You too, Grace. You want me to help with the baking? Yes yes. You're ready. Everything must be perfect. This is my one shot. I put every bit of money we have into the ptisserie. What if I blew it? What if he hates everything I make? If this goes wrong, I'll be ruined. Good. Good. Now, make sure the mixture is forming soft peaks. It must be absolutely perfect. I think it's ready. No-no-no... This won't do at all. But. I follow your directions and... these are definitely soft peaks. It's not you, Grace. It's the recipe. We must dazzle Jean-Luc and his guests. It needs a little bit of... Je Ne sais quoi. - Je Ne sais quoi? - Um-hm. I don't remember that from the recipe. What did I say? It's not an ingredient. It's a french phrase. It means, "I do not know what. " We use it to mean a little something extra, that can't quite be described in words. Here. It's better if I show you. Girls, today we seek the elusive "Je Ne sais quoi". That surprising, unexpected ingredient. Oh. Like... the violet. Did you just... eat a flower? It's a candied Violet So good, try it. Wow. - Amazing. - Or this cheese. Mm. Oh. Or maybe, perhaps this escargot. Wonderful. Non. Non? Non. I do not need to taste it. Oh. What're these beautiful bottles? Of course. The vinegar balsamic. Just a drop of balsamic vinegar in the butter cream filling of the macaron. A bit of sour develope into sweet. Grace, I believe you have found our "Je Ne sais quoi". See, just a big puppy dog. Excellent. Oh, no. I see I've been working everyone too hard. Maybe it's time to turn in for the night. But, we can't. The party's tomorrow. I think we're fine. We just need a little musical inspiration. I didn't think you for a dancer, Uncle Bernard. I thought you want the kitchen to be serious. Baking is serious. But I like to have fun doing it. No? A little "joie de vie". Um. Joie de what? Joie de vie. Joy of life. We must find something wonderful in everything we do. Grace and Sylvie, you work on the fruit tarts. Colette, you back up. Now, everyone have their jobs. - Yes! - Yes! You hear that. The music of the kitchen. Like a little dance. Clean that up. Attention. Whoa. Mmm. - Oh. - Come on, Grace. Oh. I need that. Go for it, Grace. Yeh. Yeah. Yehh! Let's hurry. I want to get home to spend as much time as I can with my petite chrie Well. I hope these don't get, how you say, smoosh going to the party. This party could change everything for my family for good. Or bad. You've done everything you could to make sure people will love your desserts. In fact, I've never met anyone more prepared than you. Except, maybe me. And. Yes, Grace? I just want to say thanks. I've learn a lot from you. Like... today, when you make sure everyone have their own job. We all felt like we are part of making things happen. It's an important part of running a bakery. Everyone has a job. It's almost like a family. How would you mean? Well, in a family just like in a kitchen, everyone has a certain role. There are moms, dads and kids but sometimes it can get confusing. Like, when new people come. Are you talking about anyone in particular? Nope. Just talking. Nice beautiful croissants and hot. My french served with killer breakfast. I'll take a hot croissant over a stack of pancakes any day. I couldn't sleep. So... I got up and baked these. Then I went over my list to make sure everything is ready for the party today. List? You sound like Grace. Well. Sylvie. You want to ride over in the van with me to the itinerary. I need to go early to set up. - Okay. Grace and I can... - Well, I was thinking just you. And then maybe get hot chocolate on the way. You mean like, this place we used to... before squeezy morning. Okay, I'll go get dressed. Hope you enjoy it. Grace. Grace. What is the matter? People keep eating these. They're suppose to. But Monsieur Pernaud hasn't try one yet, and... we made them to look perfect for him. - Relax. - I can't relax. I forced Uncle Bernard to take this risk. So... if it goes wrong, it will be all my fault. It will be fine. And he doesn't look nervous. This is my one shot. What if I blow it? - Bernard, relax. - My customers will vanish, the ptisserie will close. - Bernard, calm down. - Sophie, prepare yourself. - We're about to lose everything. - Please calm down. Oop. - Jean-Luc is coming. - What? Just... - Hello, Bernard. - Hello, Jean-Luc. - How are you? - Good, thank you. So, my guest have been talking about certain macaron of yours. Yes. Which one? The strawberry. I want to taste it. Of course. Colette. Mmm. Huh. Mmm. I see that my friends are right. They are quite happy with your desserts. In fact, many of us made why we do not serve them in my hotel. - Really? That right. - And so I've decided that we should. - Whoa, we... - That is. If you can deliver my orders on time. And at the exact level of quality I demand. Of course. - Come by my office tomorrow to discuss. - Oh, yes. Thank you. Thank you very much, Jean-Luc. - Thank you very much. - Excellent. Alert to all the guests, that the Palace de Paris now serve the delights of the ptisserie Bernard Mupin. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jean-Luc. - Yeah! - Ha-ha-ha.. Incredible. Quite a ham. And I have you girls to thank. No, Papa. It was Grace. All Grace. Yes, you're right. Grace. Thank you, my little American business woman. Thank you. Thank you. - Look, Papa. - Look at the balloon. Wow. It's so cool. It's gorgeous. Grace. It has been a joy getting to know you. And thank you for all of your help in the kitchen and everywhere else. You work hard and you are very talented. - Really? - Yeah. Didn't think you thought I was any good. Well. I admit I have my doubt at first. But you proved me wrong in so many ways. Do you think that... I'm good enough to strum my grandparents bakery some day. Oh, yeah. You're good enough to do that. And much more. You remind of myself when I was younger. Thanks And, thank you for teaching me the "Je Ne sais quoi". I'll never forget it. But here is my last lesson to you. You did not learn the "Je Ne sais quoi" The "Je Ne sais quoi" is something you keep learning. It will be different for every dish. That makes me nervous. I still like to have things plan out. To have a recipe to follow. Stay open to new challenges, Grace. Take risks. That's how you make amazing things happen. Bye bye, Miss dear. Bye, Aunt Sophie. - Bye, Grace. - Bye. Here. For your bracelet. To remember our crazy adventures at the hotel. It looks just like Bonbon. I'm sure I'm going to miss that cute little face. Now I can carry a little bit of both of you back home with me. Thanks. My cousin. And friend. Yes. Totally yes. - Bye, Grace. - Bye. Bye. - Surprise. - Hi. Hi. - Hi, Grandma. - Grace. So halfway through his bath, he jumped out of the tub and went racing around my yard, covered in bubbles. My neighbor asked what kind of dog he was and I said. - A shampoodle! - A shampoodle! - Eh-ha-ha. - Ha ha. Wow. Sounds like you guys really made the "Paw spa" a success. Surprise? No no no... It's just... Well. Now that I'm home and... I love to help. That would be amazing. - Totally amazing. - Fantastic. Awesome. Why don't I come over tomorrow and you can show me your business plan. I learn a ton about advertising from my Uncle Bernard and I've a million ideas we could use. - First, we've to get them to... - Okay, wait a minute. You don't want to help. - You want to take over. - No no no. Of course not. It's just... When I was in Paris I got to work with people who knew what they were doing running a real business. But, the paw spa is a real business. I know that. I just... thought we could use everything that I learned in France to make the paw spa better back here in the States. You thought our dog business would be an epic fail. And it wasn't. I've got news for you, Grace. We've good ideas too. It's not all about you. Come on, Ella. Let's go. Oh. Honestly. Are you sure there's nothing your parents can do. They're so far behind in the mortgage payment, I don't see how. So sad to think of closing down your mom and dad's bakery after all these years. Grandma and Grandpa's bakery is closing? Oh, honey. You weren't suppose to hear any of that. You can't give up on the bakery. Honey. Believe me, we don't want to. But we owe so much money. But, I can help. I want to try and get more customers. And, I've been saving my allowance. Plus the money from the cupcakes that will buy new bikes. Here. I want you to use it for the bakery. Grace, please sit down. It is incredibly generous of you. But. We're talking about a huge amount of money. And business has been declining for a while. - It might not be worth it. - Not... worth it? Of course our bakery is worth it. It's more than just a business. When I was with Uncle Bernard in Paris I saw that his business was more than just where he work. It was like part of him. Aunt Sophie too. They put all of their love and heart right into that place. Just like you have here. This bakery was your dream. And now it's part of our family. We can't let it go. Can't we at least try to save it. Of course, we can. But, we don't want you to get your hopes up. Too late. We can save the bakery. I just know it. Oh, I know. Thanks for coming. And, I just wanted to say that... I'm really sorry, for everything I said yesterday. - Oh, we're sorry too. - We're sorry too. We're suppose to be your besties, but we're acting like worsties. I can't believe I said all those mean things. You were right. I wasn't listening. I mean you guys have great ideas too. And, the truth is... I really miss you guys in Paris. I was miserable at first, I just made it sound perfect because I was jealous that you guys started this amazing business and were having so much fun without me. Well. Actually... The paw spa isn't going quite as great as we made it sound. We don't have a ton of customers like we said. - More like... - One. - Yeah, - Goose is my Aunt's dog. We exaggerated because we're jealous of your perfect tarte Tatin. But, there's something else. I need your help. My grandparent's bakery is in trouble. But I've a plan to save it. No. You, a plan? I'm shock. But, this plan is special. When I was in Paris, my Uncle made sure everyone had the right job. When all of the jobs are put together, the kitchen works like magic. We can have the same thing here. This time... I promise. It will really be all of us together. So. What do you say? - We're in! - We're in! - Oh. - Oh. - Best friends forever! - Best friends forever! This looks so good. Voila! How would you like to try a sample. Buy one get one free for all bake goods. - Here ya. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Hi! Uncle Bernard double his business by getting an account with the local hotel. So can we. Honesty professionalism. Dedication. Self control. I'm counting on you. We all are. Now, let's get out there and make it happen. Yes. Do it for Bonbon. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's official. With this order, we've double our income this month. - Really? - Oh. So. Does this mean we save the bakery? As long as they like what we bake. Yes! Then nothing can stop us now. Except that. - Can we fix it? - Absolutely. Not. MasterChef?

You impressed us in the past with your tarte Tatin. What have you made for us now? A croquembouche. A traditional french wedding cake. But, instead of cream puffs, I use macarons. It's actually quite beautiful. I'm just slightly troubled with the violets. I candied them in sugar syrup. But the violets weren't an ingredient. Sure, they were. They were part of the decoration. That's got to be a MasterChef first. You said we can use anything on the table. And in fact, you did. Very very bold move. Let's see if it pays off. It's quite interesting. The violets, have an incredible perfume. It bring a whole likeness and flavor to your cake. It's good. In fact, very very good. But. Is it good enough, to win. Gentlemen.

We love you too, sweetie. And. We want you to take some of your winnings and get yourself that new bike you wanted. You know, Grand. Saving the bakery is way better than a new bike. My old one is perfectly fine. Oh. And, Ella and I still have our old bikes. So we can be at the back of the Berwick race together. I'll take a new bike. - Josh. - Josh. I'm just saying. Still, there must be something special you like for yourself. Well, there is 1 thing. I'd like to get Sylvie a ticket to come to America. I really want you to meet her. I wish she was here right now. Well. What would you say to her if she were here right now. Well. I'd tell her how much fun I had in Paris and how much I missed her. Well. She says she miss you too.

Wait a minute. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Do you speak English? I know that mimes don't talk. But. Could you cut me a break and help me figure out which way to go. 'Cause I... You know what?
