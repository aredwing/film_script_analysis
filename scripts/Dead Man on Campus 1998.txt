BUT I HAD TO SPEND 6 MONTHS IN INTENSIVE THERAPY WITH PROFESSOR DURKHEIM, AND I LEARNED I LIKED PSYCHOLOGY MORE THAN MEDICINE SO I CHANGED MY MAJOR. BYE, BOB. COOPER'S DAD WAS SO PROUD HE PAID FOR HIM TO STAY IN SCHOOL FOR ANOTHER YEAR. HE STILL HAD TO SPEND VACATIONS WORKING AT THE COMPANY AND HE SAYS, IF YOU'RE STONED ENOUGH, SCRUBBING TOILETS CAN BE A ZEN-LIKE EXPERIENCE.
