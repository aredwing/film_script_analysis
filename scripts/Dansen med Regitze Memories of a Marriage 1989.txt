WALTZING REGITZE Helle Schou Kristiansen - IFT A/S One, two... five here, five there. That's right. - But let's just set the table for 11. - When we've invited 13? Silly. - Do you think they're coming? - Well, they haven't said otherwise. They belong. There goes that friendship. A lifelong friendship. Your old mate wants to see us. For meatballs. They have a free evening. How nice. - Why do we keep on seeing them? - I won't end the friendship. - Maybe we are growing apart... - Maybe? Look, they've always been a part of things... now and then anyway. Now and when? You always swell with pride when they show up. Your friend, the manufacturer, in his fancy clothes... He got further and further away from you. From us... from himself. I can't stand it any more. One day I'll tell him what's what! Excuse me. You'll never get the hang of it. Well, he hasn't had much chance to, has he? Right, one should've stuck to the beers and the easy jobs. You're a lucky man, Karl Aage. Soon you'll retire to a carefree life. I wish I could afford to drop the whole thing. - My men are too sure of themselves. - Do you mean your employees? My men whom I pay a fortune. But not to do slovenly work and jabber. - I won't tolerate it any more. - No more Mr Nice Guy, eh? - I'm going to reorganize. - Fire the lazy, irresponsible men? Reorganize, as I said. It happens to be my company, Regitze. After the reorganization you'll hire more cooperative workers? I don't know what I'll do. It depends on the situation then. Satisfied? You're a bastard and you always have been! I've often wanted to tell you that. And I think I speak for Karl Aage too. Now please call a cab. We're going home. I'm very sorry, Ilse... You provoked him into acting much worse than he really is. - I just told him my opinion. - Do you always have to do that? We've seen the last of them. - Ilse! - Hello. Ilse, hello. - I'm glad you could make it. - Although I'm a bloody bastard? Maybe not a bloody one. Come on, we just have time for a drink. It's turning into a proper little country home. It's a lovely garden. You've really got yourself a nice place. It's just great here. You're a lucky man, Karl Aage. But then I've always said that. You must spend most of your time out here? - We do. - And the rest of us never sit still. What I wouldn't give to just sit here with a cold beer. Right, Ilse? This is Ilse and this is my old friend Karl Aage. A drink? - Don't you want to be alone? - Rubbish, it's Saturday night! - Anyway, Ilse brought a friend. - Hi, it's Karl Aage, right? Karl Aage! Don't despair, she's got plenty more, get it? That's Vera and Vivi and Lis and that's... - Grete. - Right. And this is Karl Aage. A hell of a dancer and a great guy. You're supposed to look after her. Go for it, she's not that bad. - She's all right. - Tell her she's smart. Be creative. You're such a drag. These two German soldiers were discussing what to do after the war. "I'm going to get pissed. How about you," says one of them. "I'm going to rent a car and drive around in the great Vaterland." "Great, but what are you going to do in the afternoon?" Borge's great fun to be around. Hi. Ilse's friend is ill. So you'll have to cope on your own tonight. Not that there's much doing here. Let's dance, Ilse. We can move on afterward. - One orange soda. - Do I have to bite a hole in it? Remember when... - Sir? - An orange soda. May I May I have this dance? Yes you may. I'm Karl Aage. I don't even know your name. My name's Regitze. An old-fashioned, dull name. Regitze? I think it's pretty. I mean it. It's a nice change from all the usual names. It suits you. Regitze... Don't you like the sound of it? Yes, when you say it it sounds rather nice. This is Annie and that's Rikard. They're my very best friends. Ilse and I are leaving. Are you coming? Of course you aren't. I quite understand. - Regitze, we'll take you home. - Don't bother. Karl Aage will take me. - We're staying here this summer. - Well, you have been everywhere. Karl Aage hates traveling and I could go alone... Why don't you and I go somewhere sometime? Why don't we... sometime. Here comes the next shift. Nice to see you. This garden life has put color into your cheeks. We've been looking forward to this. You too? How nice. - Hello, Jonas. - Thanks for the invitation. - Even Borge and Ilse are here. - Well, they belong, don't they? Put on your glasses, Rikard. Gangway, make room for John. This was such a good idea. Some party, eh? Wake up, Dad. Wake up, Dad! Come on, you two. You're going to the baker's. Party? Right, Mum wanted to have a little get-together. - What would you do without her? - Right. We're all here. Let's sit down then. Take a glass and a chair. We didn't have time to fix that. Listen up, everyone. Karl Aage, you sit at the head next to Gloria and Ilse. Then Jonas and the kids. John next to Ilse... - and then Annie, Rikard, Vibeke Borge and I at this end of the table. Will you help with the drinks? And, Vera, help me in the kitchen. Right... let's have a toast. Hello... Granddad? We're waiting for you, Karl Aage. Right... sorry. - Sorry. - We'd like to welcome you all. Cheers. What a perfect day for Regitze's summer party. - Where did you get all those? - I bought them. Cheap. Have you spent all your wages on flowers? I only meant to buy a small bunch because it's Saturday, but then... - You must be out of your mind. - What's done is done. Stop it... listen to me! You crazy woman! Don't worry, I'm not going to make a speech. I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart... - for inviting Ilse and me today. Ilse and I go out a lot, maybe too much, ... - and we have a load of business dinners to get through. And for the most part it's boring as hell. We have several acquaintances we simply have to cultivate. But we don't have all that many friends. And... well, I just want to say... - that nobody makes us feel more at home than you, Regitze. And you too, of course, Karl Aage. Here's to both of them. They go back a long way. Is your Mum very religious or something? Only if it's religious to meddle and make yourself unpopular. Is it your wedding anniversary today, Karl Aage? Or some other anniversary, eh? Don't ask him, he's no good at dates. There's no anniversary. Pass the herrings, Karl Aage. I never thought you'd up and marry. We did the respectable thing and married before we had children. But you had John first. Yes, we had him first. Why did we get married, Karl Aage? Your Mum. Right. People didn't just live together then. In sin? Are you living together in sin? Well, we were lucky to get the apartment. It's a bit dark... Never mind how dark it is! What's important is that you're living there together. - I won't permit it, Regitze. - You don't have to. It's a fact. I would never have imagined that about my only child. - Soon you'll be telling me... - No, we're not planning a baby. We can't afford it yet. - You just want to enjoy yourselves. - No, we care for each other. - Regitze and I are fond of... - Young man! Get married. As a matter of fact we didn't plan to get married. Your father wouldn't have approved. Drink your coffee, Mum. Dad's dead. You must come and visit us. I want you to see my bedspread and you must feel the mattress. - Pass the toast, will you? - Why of course. Why do the Irish have one full and one empty glass by the bed? Well, either they get thirsty during the night or else they don't. Have you thought about the consequences? He might leave you. Or I might leave him. But we're not going anywhere Well, neither am I until I see a marriage certificate. - But, Mum... - In my time people got married! But you live your immoral lives like in ancient Rome or whatever. - We were married yesterday, Mum. - About time! Come to Granny. What a pretty little boy. - Which of you does he take after? - You'd better make the extra bed. Yes, I don't intend to sleep on the floor. I've found your christening robe, and you've only worn it once... - so it only needs a good wash. You'll be such a handsome baby. We're not going to baptize him, Mum. He's not going to be baptized. Karl Aage and I have made that decision. - It's our son, Mum. - But it's my grandson. - And he's going to be baptized. - That's not for you to decide. I'll get that boy baptized if it's the last thing I do. We've never had heathens in our family! I'm not going to let her get away with this. It's our baby. Here you are. For once I want you to be firm. Mrs Andersen told me to say she's gone to bed. - Who's gone to bed? - Mum. - Is she ill? - She's bedridden. And she's going to stay in bed till the stubbornness subsides. She won't eat and won't see you. That's what she told me to say. Very well. Thank you. - She hasn't done that before. - A hunger strike? - She loves food. God Almighty! - She won't give in. - Stupid old bag. - But this time she'll have to. We have to be firm, Karl Aage! She won't see a doctor, she's losing weight and she's very weak. She's lost almost five pounds. Thank God she's not too weak to go on the scales. - It's not funny, Karl Aage. - And she can't sleep at night. Well, tell her... Oh, I don't know! - Do we have to do something? - We're being firm! I've brought you some nourishing soup, Mum. It'll do you good. She says thank you very much, but she's not hungry. Wouldn't it help if you got up and about? She hasn't got anything to get up for any more. Shouldn't I fetch the doctor? No doctor can help her. We presume you want to hear about a person you've caused much grief. Mrs Andersen can't move any more, Mrs Andersen is as good as dead. - She can't even whisper any more. - I'll pass it on. It was the daily news. - Has she got worse? - It sounds so. It's no good. You'd better see the vicar tomorrow. - Didn't we agree... - I'll do it then! But, Regitze... Didn't we agree... Didn't you tell me to be firm? Isn't it our son? I'm amazed at your stubbornness. You're willing to let people die because of your silly idea. Why can't he just be baptized like every other child? Oh, you moved, Karl Aage. And it was almost a wrap. My mother could be troublesome but she was a remarkable person. My mother's a bit out of the ordinary too. One Christmas... - Shut up, Dad. - You tell that story every year! - You don't even tell it well. - We know it by heart. Your go. Hi. Boy, it's getting chilly outside. - There's coffee on the stove. - Great, I'll be right back. Regitze? How come I can't find my winter coat? You never use your winter coat, Karl Aage. I use it on chilly nights like this. It's no good. You need a new one. There's nothing wrong with it. It could have lasted for years. Regitze, what have you done with my coat? You know the old fellow who drops by sometimes... He was shivering with cold and you hardly ever use that coat. So it was mine. Did you give him my coat? You're crazy! You can't just give some bum my good clothes. - He has a name! It's Nielsen. - I don't give a damn! I might get pneumonia, so what? As long as Nielsen is warm. Right, let's get it all out in the open now. - There's more? - He's coming on Christmas Eve. - Well, now you know. - You didn't invite him? This was going to be our first Christmas without your Mum. - You didn't? Christ, Regitze! - I told him to come around 6 pm. Hurry up, Regitze. We're starving. You're so naive. He's forgotten all about it. He's probably dead-drunk. Your Good Samaritan-bit is over. Get it, will you? I'm busy making the gravy. You've been doing that for half an hour. Regitze? I hope you don't mind, Mam, but I've brought some of my mates. They didn't have anywhere to go. My wife is just making the gravy. Come on in. You're very kind, Mam. - A little present. - Thanks a lot. - Thanks for inviting us. - It smells delicious. I love you with all of my heart. - Flowers for the little missus. - Come here, Karl Aage. Show your Dad. Look at that. - What have you been up to? - Tell what happened, John. I didn't make any trouble in class but he took it out on me. That's too bad. But I'm glad you didn't do anything to deserve it. You'll get over that. No coffee? - Is that all you have to say? - What do you want me to say? What's done is done. He's not the only boy in the world who's been slapped undeservingly. - As long as it doesn't happen again. - What a way to look at it. You'll put up with the injustice as long as it doesn't happen again? Look, I didn't slap him, did I? - What do you want me to do? - I'm not just going to ignore it. Nobody slaps my boy. I'll give that teacher a piece of my mind. Don't, Mum. That'll only make it worse. - It's better not to interfere. - What a ridiculous thing to say! - I won't always just back off. - Regitze, let's talk about it. Is she going to do it? Is she going to see my teacher? Of course she is. What a totally ridiculous question. - Don't you ever have homework? - No. I think she's mad too. What are you talking about? Your Mum is absolutely right. She's not doing this for your sake alone, get it? She's thinking about all the other kids he might some day beat up. Get it? We don't have to put up with everything. There's such a thing as self respect. Let me see again. The bastard! Go get yourself a lemonade in the icebox. My boy is among the graduates. - I'm going up to celebrate him. - Oh? I mean, your son doesn't graduate every day. Michael! Hi. This is John's Dad. He's sped home from work to congratulate you. - Cheers. - Right, cheers. - Cheers, old man. - Cheers. Oh, sorry. I really respect a real worker like yourself. You are what you are. - Not like all the pompous... - Leave off it, Soren. - Sit down. - No, I'm fine right here. Congratulations, my boy. - I'd like... - No speech. Let's move on, okay? Bye-bye. That little snob. Just wait till I get my hands on him! Long live them both! Hurray! Even the wind wishes them well! Why did he have to barge in in those scruffy clothes? - Which he? - Dad of course. It's okay. Leave the boy alone. I didn't know what to say anyway. - But it's not that... - Don't you ever try that again! You felt better than us because you've got that bloody exam... - and have a chance to get a nice job. Well, we won't call you "sir"! - Leave him alone, Regitze. - Don't be embarrassed by us... - just coz you have a good head, coz it's not all that good! - Do you understand? - I didn't mean it like that. - Well, it sure seemed like it. - I know that... - I'm glad you're letting me study. - We love you, John. We love you so very, very much. And we're incredibly proud of you. - Let's keep it that way, John. - Yes. I'm sorry, Dad. You're supposed to be smart. How did you get mixed up in this? Why didn't you like my girlfriend? She's a vain little tart. My boy deserves better than that! - You could a least pretend. - Why on earth should I do that? - I've never done that. - No, you just want the last word. - You know I'm right. Elinor... - Avy! A model! That's the most discriminating job I ever... - I'd have more respect for a hore! - Watch your tongue! Haven't I brought you up to look for more than just a good figure? God Almighty! - What if I want to marry her? - You don't. Listen to me! Live with her for a while but don't ever marry her! - I'll decide! - Do as I say! - You can't prevent me! - You'll not see us at the wedding! - Call, if you change your minds. - Or if you do... Wait a moment, both of you. Let's all behave like adults. Don't go, we're a happy family! - Why don't I learn to keep quiet? - I've often wondered about that. Of course she isn't John's type. But he'll find out by himself. In time. You could at least have tried to be kind to our only son's girlfriend. Oh, you moved, Karl Aage. And it was almost a wrap. You have enough pictures of us. Let's dance now. Get a move on, Dad. Maybe we could... You could call him. Or maybe we could, you know, ... - happen to drop by and say hello. I'll put them in his closet. - I have wonderful news. - The coffee's waiting. I went to see John. If he won't come to us I have to come to him. This couldn't go on. Anyway, it's over with that dreadful tart. - Come now... - It's over and I'm overjoyed. Well, at least he can concentrate on his studies now. He's starting on a shorter education. He'll need it now. - Why now? - And he's found the loveliest girl. Vibeke. He's living at her place. She's just the girl for John. I felt like I'd always known her. I immediately took a liking to her. - And the children are lovely. - The children? She's divorced and older than him and she has two children. I won't let you slink out of dancing with me. - Worried about your lawn? - Well, it'll probably be ruined. - Oh, it'll be all right. - Sure. Not too close. Karl Aage is dancing. Get out! I'm not allowed out there. She's been crying for hours. No regrets! Men are like that. Totally unreliable. I'm hungry but she's too busy to cook supper. - Why don't you go get a hot dog? - What about you? We're having coffee... in-between. John, don't stay up too long, eh? It's very sweet of you to be so patient. Now, look... The fact of the matter is that Gloria wants a divorce. She's going to stay here for a while. She'll sleep on the couch. I've told her she can count on us. - That's what friends are for. - Sure. I've also told Gloria that we'll do our best to help... - and that you'll go home to her husband and fetch some clothes. - Me? - No, I'll go. No way. He'll beat the living daylights out of you. - Karl Aage will fetch it. - So he can beat me up? Right, Karl Aage? Does it have to be right now? It's late... Think of Gloria's husband. He doesn't know where she is. He must be worried about her. Women, Christ! Gloria's husband? - So she's not coming home? - No. She's never been gone this long. I'm supposed to fetch her things. My wife's letting her stay with us. I don't know... what comes over me. Sometimes... I didn't mean to hurt her. - She knows that. - Help me gather some clothes. Sure... we even have a suitcase somewhere. Let me. Here are your things. I hope you can use some of it. What did he say? He understood that it couldn't go on. But he took it quite well. - So go on back to sleep. - You and Regitze... Oh no, stop it... - Would you rather rest? - No, I'm fine. I'm not tired. Tonight we're going to have fun. Take a firm grip around me. If I'd break I'd have done it a long time ago. Try again. Don't be mad, I'm having such a good time. - It's New Year's Eve. - I have noticed, you know. Go on back, Karl Aage. Be a good sport. - Don't leave without Regitze. - Just shut up! Why haven't we met before? You've never been newly divorced on a New Year's Eve before, right? You're wonderful, Regitze. Does your quiet husband remember to tell you how beautiful you are? Don't be so serious. It's a nice evening. It's summer and everybody came to the party. Karl Aage, are you thinking? Yes... tonight it's like all the doors are open. And I keep wandering in and out of them all. Are you having a quiet beer? Great party, eh? Cheers! Don't be stupid, Karl Aage. You have a great wife. I hope you see to it that she has fun. "But why the eyepatches?" "it's their first day with a hook." Regitze? - What now? - It's Karl Aage. Have you come for Regitze's shoes? - That's why you're here, right? - Regitze's shoes? - Right, she forgot them. So she... - Shut up, Rikard. Here you go. And you can tell her from me that it's silly to forget your shoes. But how the hell did she manage that? It must have been high. You left before the party ended. I went to fetch John. But we'd better leave together next time. But there won't be a next time. You were gone when I came home. I've fetched your shoes. You'd forgotten them. Oh, right. The shoes. How silly of... I think we need a cup of coffee. Karl Aage, I want to ask you something. Well? Is it stupid of me to think it could work outwith Jonas and me? - Why shouldn't it? - I'm being realistic. And at our age. I mean, none of us live forever. But if only we got five years together I'd be satisfied with life. - More than satisfied. - Why shouldn't you get ten years? If only we could stretch time. We don't know these people well enough to have a garden party. You know the Jensens in the brown cottage. And the ones in the funny little green cottage. You do know them. Look, you put that over there. Good, you brought the parrot. And over here... Oh, hello. Hold this, will you? Hello, dear. - You have a wonderful wife. - Yes. - I didn't know you knew her. - Everybody knows Regitze. I'm Jonas by the way. I live in the yellow cottage. I'm "The Poet". I'll drop by again soon. Regitze has invited me over for a drink. - My wife's good at making friends. - Isn't it wonderful? Sure. - That's enough! For God's sake. - Don't. - She can't! - It seems she can. She could get hurt on a broken bottle. Where do I get a doctor? No, Regitze doesn't get hurt. And she doesn't make a fool of herself. - It's turned into a lovely place. - How long have they had it? Since the early sixties. Karl Aage hammered away every summer and every weekend. That's almost 30 years ago. Has it taken me - You had your books to write. - Did you buy it 30 years ago? You're turning into a real grump. I can't stand being here any more. Bugger, my Dad's unemployed. Don't ever do that again! Nobody slaps my boy! - Tell us why you bought it. - It was coz he'd found work again. - He hated being unemployed. - Go on, you tell it so well. - Go on, old boy. - No, not tonight. - Lay off. - Look, are you getting divorced? - Shut up! - No more now. I didn't mean to hit him. I don't want to be like this. But I can't stand it! Can't you see it my way, Regitze? You get sick and tired of queuing up and waiting. Only to be told that there's no work. Aren't my hands as good as everybody eases? Do you think I like being a worthless piece of garbage? Stop it! Is this the man I married? I thought I'd married a real man but what did I end up with? A whimpering, blubbering fool! I won't accept that. You're out of work right now, but so what? You're not the only one. Lots of others are far worse off coz you'll get a job again. Maybe not tomorrow or next week but some day you will. But in the meantime you'll have to find something to do! Get yourself that garden or something. Just do something! And stop wearing yourself and the rest of us out. Stop it! You can live there all year round if you had the time and it was legal. It's a great cottage, he said. Living room, kitchen, bathroom... And running water. And one day we'll get electricity. Hello. - It's wonderful. - Yes, it is. Look, I want one like that. Very nice. Hello. It's really nice here. And we can grow greens, potatoes and flowers. - He said it was a great cottage. - Have you seen it? You haven't... - A field of weeds with a loo. - Just wait till we've fixed it up. Right! It'll be great. It'll be just perfect. Imagine buying a junkheap like that without seeing it first. - Our weekends are booked up now. - Yes, the next five years! - Men! - And especially Karl Aage. Let's go see the inside of the loo. We're the guests that never go home. Yes, we've always been the last. Sometimes... in the old days you stayed all night. We've stuck together for as long as I can remember. Yes, it's good to stick together. We're counting on you, Karl Aage. We've got nowhere else to put him. Pretend you're playing. It's our leader, Leif to you, he's one of our best men. He's been betrayed and we can't get him out tonight. Only I know your address. It's our only chance. Okay? Sure, but... I don't want Regitze mixed up in it. She knows perfectly well what's going on. Bad excuse. She's no problem. I'll send him over tonight and if Regitze really is so naive... - you'll think of a story. Don't try to fool me, Karl Aage. I know what's going on. Be careful. I don't want to lose you. He's dead. We got him as far as the boat house... - and the fishing boat was on its way in. The beach was quiet and he was talking to the other fugitives. Our contact was on his way back. Everything went as planned. But suddenly the Germans appeared with searchlights and machine guns. They shot him. - It wasn't all fun and games. - No... but still. Just imagine if he'd had to shoot someone. He'd never hit them. Neither would Karl Aage. I think... I think our time for the most part has been good. We'll be here for some time yet. - How long? - One or two months. Six months at the most. I'm sorry. - Do you smoke? - But she was cured. - That's why they sent her home. - No, she can't be cured. - I thought you ought to know. - But can't you do something? You're a doctor. Someone must be able to do something. It's not true. ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS BLUE STRAWBERRIES SWEET, SO ARE YOU I don't want any blubbering. I want nothing to change. I want to have a summer party in the garden as before. - Regitze. - A nice and happy party. - Do you hear me? - Yes, I hear you. Don't look like that. I want nothing to change. Otherwise I'll go to pieces Tomorrow... I think it'll be a nice day tomorrow. I'm going to lie in the garden with a book and be waited upon. And when John comes you can help him with the records and stuff. And afterward... you'll sit next to me and drink a beer. But that's today, Regitze. It's already today. There'll be many more nice days. The good weather will last at least a month, or so they say. We can stay here. And if it rains we'll go to town or to the cinema. Or out to dinner. Or to one of the exhibitions you like. - We'll have plenty to do. - Yes, we still have plenty to do.
