Hold it, do you want to kill her? - What are you doing? - She's got a chain! Let's get out of here! Let's just go! God, what a state she's in! Argo... Argo, where are you? Is anyone here? Help me, where's my dog? What's your name? Can you hear me? Hang on... Better? There's one over there. See to them. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Leave the report to us. - Ok. They're Police... - Mine died on his own. - I helped mine out. It's us. - Message received. - Falco two to Trionfale Street. - Hi, got anything? - No, nothing for you. - Thanks for the cigarette. - Cut it out! Pain in the ass ! - They're for... - I bought them. Put them back where you found them. Nice try. - Is the boss busy? - Yes, tomorrow there's a burglary. - In a jewelry store. - Who are they? Baldi has confirmed three South Americans. - Who's going ? - The Boss will decide. Ok Which one of us would you fuck? Well? - Which one? - Both of you! Dirty bitch! But who would you have first? Not both of us together! I'd have you, him and then a third and a fourth. Women have far more stamina than men. When a man's had enough, a woman can have two or three more orgasms, it's easy for us to carry on. Come on! Hotshots, women have to put up with the little satisfaction you give. Masculine supremacy is bullshit, You believe in Superman... You invite us to a sumptuous banquet but don't get past the starters. The lady of the night has spoken! If we fall in love then we can put up with a lousy fuck, but I don't love you. Fair enough, but who would you fuck? - Both of you. - For god's sake! I'll meet Pasquini in an hour. We're coming too. Roberto Pasquini, alias Bibi, in one hour I'll break your neck. - Do you know where he is? - No, a friend is going to take me. - Some place you know? - No, but it's the right tip-off. I've been looking for you everywhere, You're untraceable! Superintendent, Guido, Alfredo and Antonio are here. We have formed a special force with new criteria. We have a computer that cost an arm and a leg. With our archives memorised it means you can act immediately and without fucking up! Your informer is anonymous But don't trust him. - But in this case... - l don't doubt your good faith. Special force principles must be respected. - Information is checked. - But Pasquini... No exceptions. And you're in my bad books. I'm not saying you're incompetent, But every time you're out on a job you leave two or three bodies behind in bits and pieces. - We have to put up with a lot. - You're telling me, I'm forced to invent reports that are sent to the Ministry. I'm in charge of what you do and when you do it. You're giving me white hairs. - Who's taking you to Pasquini? - Someone who deals in drugs. But Pasquini is into card playing joints and real estate. He buys and sells property. And this guys has to buy an apartment from him. - Why is he letting you meet him ? - You don t get it. It's not a fixed appointment, I've been seeing this guy every day. We have dinner together, go to clubs, play cards... By the way, the godfather has two other joints. A swanky place outside of Rome and one by the sea, be careful! My friend won't take me to him, I'll meet them when they make the apartment deal. I get it. We're meeting in an hour, we'll go together and then... What about this friend? He's Neapolitan, called Sasa and lives around here. - Does he know where Pasquini lives? - No-one knows. With all respect, what's the big deal? If he's around, fine if not, we'll wait. We've been trying for three years, another go wouldn't hurt would it? And our reputation? There's no point investigating him, if Guido doesn't trust his contact I can't authorise the operation. How did it go this morning? Fine, they were in front of a bank, details were correct. - Then? - They died. They crashed into a lorry. His was disemboweled by the gear stick. And mine broke his back bone. If they were on the same bike why were there two other bikes? - One went one way... - And one went the other way. So you tossed a coin in order to decide. Go. Get out! You didn't convince me before. Men are better than women, in bed. "Superior" and "inferior" are phallocrat terms. - What? - Phallocrat. It's having had too many lousy fucks, and blames all men instead of just the pansies she's been with. Know the tale of the Fox and Grapes? l could handle a dozen like you. You're already tired! - Come on! - I'm coming. - We'll speak about this later. - I'm always here. I think this club is Pasquini's pride and joy. - Has it ever been reported? - No never. Businessmen and rich kids go there. You only get in if you're a member, or really well known. And we're neither. That's why we don't want to go in, right? This way. Good evening, We'll see to the car. Hi, nice hair! Get the handcuffs. - There's a car coming. - I'll go. - Good evening, we'll see to the car. - Careful, it's still running. - He's from the pasta factory. - He's here to play - instead of raising wages. - What do you care ? Ferrari-Bertinetta GT... Drench them! This is the factory guy's, right? - Watch it, it's still running! - I should have got four star! - Is this the regular stuff? - It costs less. That's enough, now light it, but be careful. Here. - We'll warm you up a little now. - Yes, it's damp out tonight! - That's some bonfire! - We've burnt your car too. I thought it was yours. - So whose was it? - Whatever. - We'll have to walk back. - Let's take the bus! I've got no idea who it was. - Any ideas Superintendent ? - Well, yes. I'm sure it was an inside job. I'm sure they are professionals. The way they messed up my men, the speed... Speed depends on how many there were. There were two of them. They arrived in a Lancia sports car. - I've done some investigating. - Are you trying to steal my job? There's nothing to laugh at, idiot. My men were handcuffed by the police. Police, that's who they are. - What do they know at Police HQ? - I don't know anything. Give him the money. Try to find something out. - How much have you brought me? - Half, and maybe the last. Have you ever heard of a special force? Quite a lot actually. I know Guido Oddi, who you killed, was part of it. Guido Oddi had balls and was on to us. You got to him in time, What's your connection with this special force? Officially, we take no interest, but I know everything. - Everything? - Almost. I know they weren't instructed to burn expensive cars. I want a complete, detailed report. Almost is not enough, you have to find out everything. Turn that thing off! - Alfredo, the door. - I heard. You're such a pain in the arse! - Who is it? - Rosa. Good morning. - I just want to have a look. - Only idiots buy newspapers! If you say so... Anything about last night? All positive comments. Everyone enjoyed the show. The public... Critics. A real success. Everyone wants to know who did it but the club isn't mentioned. We'll buy other newspapers, they don't all think the same. The layout may be different but not the content... Remember to pay Rosa. - Is it my turn? - It sure is. It had to be this month... Here is your money. Aren't you going to send your pretty niece anymore? She dusted so well... And was a good lay too! Pray to God she gets her period this month. If she's pregnant, it's your fucking problem! No, it's yours. You're surrounded, surrender! There's no escape. - Are you speaking with HQ? - Yes. You've been busted, surrender! - It's worth waiting. - But they're not listening. Get back. You three, Go. - Where? - On the roof. Don't shoot unless necessary. Wretched murderers! - Go away. - Stop it! Shut up! - I'll kill you! - Stop. Behave, we're serious now! Sons of bitches! Let's go and speak to that bastard. Come on. Behave or I'll break your arm. Come on. Help! They're killing me! Give us a car! I won't come out anymore, We'll only talk on the phone. Write this number down: Get that? 64 38 96. Call me. Help, they're killing me! Get that son-of-a-bitch off the roof! Help! Get down! You too. Yes, all of you. Let's get back. I knew it, let's give ourselves up. - What the hell are you saying? - I'm going crazy! - Go and guard! You go and guard the other door, run! It's dangerous, get back. Here comes the Vice Chief of Police. We've made contact. - Who is the hostage? - The owner of the house. - What do they want? - A get-away car. Of course, and they're using an innocent hostage to get it. They're waiting for us to call. Why are you doing this to me? I'm Ruggero Ruggerini, known as "The Dog". I want a fast car with a full tank you've got half an hour. We'll take granny with us. Do you want to hear her? Speak! Help, they're killing me! Help! Call me back when it's ready. And if you both lose your nerve, I'll kill you ! Thanks for getting a direct line with the house. We're from the special force. Clear the road. Let's go. Come on, clear the road those people can't stay they're. Come on! Hurry up. Moretti, block access to the road. Go on, go! Quickly! They're doing what we want. Scaredy-cat, see what they're doing. Old hag, where's the liquor? Tell me! If I didn't need you, I'd kill you! What the fuck's this, castor oil? Screw you! Since they've already killed three. An old lady... They will throw her out of the car when they feel out of danger. They're out of their minds, they know they'll get 30 years. They've got nothing to lose. I spoke to Ruggerini, he's a nasty bit of work. - If they get out, they'll escape. - And we have a disadvantage. - That poor woman. - Think of it as an advantage too. The house has four sides and there are three of them. But they never leave the doors or windows unguarded. I don't suggest a group attack. It would be a blood bath. Get a car here. If we let up, those three killers will be free. And the old woman might not be safe after all. I know who you are, that you're good and that you risk your life everyday. I agree that it would be better to intervene but we can't waste time if you don't know how. - We could surprise them. - How? - With a helicopter. - They'd never expect that, because they're based in the city and won't head for the countryside. But if they get lost in traffic, how will a helicopter help? The element of surprise. - We'll act under their instructions. - And do what we want. Who is it? Right, we'll be out at one p.m. sharp. Try any tricks and we'll kill the woman. She's alright. We're going soon, pass this around. In exactly four minutes I want you over our heads. Ok, in four minutes over your heads. You two can go back in. Get up old hag, keep us company. Please, I beg you, leave me! Shut up, why are you shouting? Don't take me with you. No, help! Keep your wits about you. Help! What are you doing? Dick-head! Bring the car here. Now! - Step on it... - Shut up! The clutch, pussy! Don't you know how to drive, moron? Stop. The clutch! Quickly. Stop. Don't let it near or I'll kill her. I told you to send it away! We didn't call for it. Get back in, they're lying. Watch your backs. Kill them! Shut up or I'll strangle you. Come on. - Dirty... - Let me go! I don't care if you're an addict or a dealer. I can let you off the hook if you win at my club. But if you go to the Police, you deserve to be beaten-up. They found a million on me, I had to tell them about the club. Truth is one thing, being a spy is another. They charged me for a bank robbery, They got a copper as a witness. He's not sure it was me but it could be me. They set me up. I'd like to see it your way, but how can I if you are a spy ? They set me up, with my past record l'd get twenty years. You don't know what my record's like. - It would have cost me. - It might cost you more. You'll remember me till you die. No, I beg you, stop him! I've always been loyal. Menica... Are you deaf? Menica, the telephone! Why are you shouting? I was busy in there. Lina, it's your brother. Here she is...Come on. Has the money arrived ? Have you got over your cold? How are you? No, I can't during the week. The other night I saw you, I was in my car waiting for someone. Who were those two with you? Ok, bye. Ruggerini has been eliminated. The results of the operation are positive. But the way you acted isn't. The Special Force number one rule is to never put a citizen at risk. Even old people. Sit down. - Sit down. - I'm fed up of sitting down. We've intercepted a call at Pasquini's house, Or at least it used to be. He's been gone for four years. A matronly type who looks after her baby sister. Do something. The Rico cousins will hold up a bank security van. There will be all five of them. What time is the van arriving? Ok. - At twelve. - It's eleven. - I'll send the beat patrol. - Why? - They know them too. - They've committed four murders. - Four for sure. - That's without counting today's. - There won't be any killing today. - No? We don't need the Special Force. Guys like these are easily recognised. Don't you worry, We even know which bar they are going to meet in. It'll be a piece of cake. - We just have to handcuff them. - You can't handcuff those people. And anyway, it's a job for us. At cafe 'Fiume' in front of the bank. - At twelve. - If there's nothing else... - Let's get a coffee. - In that cafe. Ok. I'll have two sandwiches and a beer. No beer? Well whatever you've got then. One de-caff and one regular coffee. Thanks. Excuse me? You get the driver and you go the other side. Where are you? - Good morning. - Where does Pasquini live? Where does Pasquini live? Why are you asking me? Do you want my comic? - You're hurting me. - Where does Pasquini live? l don't talk to threatening people. - Talk to me. - I'm not saying anything. - Well ? - Third floor, stairs E. Where is it? Give me my comic back. - Good... - Sorry. They're thieves too! Look at that. Nina, have you got any parsley? No, I didn't go out, the baby's sick. Ok, bye. Menica, the bell. It's ringing ! I've got it. Menica, Menica... - Well? - Is Mr Pasquini there? He doesn't live here. But it's written on the name plate. Yes, but he doesn't live here - This is his sister Lina's house. - We still want to come in. I'm not letting in two hooligans like you. - Police. - I don't believe it. What's the world coming to?! Two Police with faces like thieves! He never comes here are you stupid enough to think that Pasquini would wait for you here? - We just want to have a look around. - No. You need a warrant to do that. You could ask first! Go on then, get moving. Hurry up sweethearts, I've got work to do. They're searching the house. Who cares?! His sister is in there, hurry up. This is the kitchen need to look in the fridge' too? Can I come in? Good morning.. Lina... That's your name, right? Listen... Where is Bibi? - What are you doing? - Your brother? He's fucking your mother, or someone like her. He's not fucking my mother. She doesn't think about that anymore. But you seem quite keen on being fucked. So, your brother? - He's fucking someone else. - Well, that's a start. What's wrong? Get on top of me. He calls every now and then. From phone booths, a few words then he hangs up. So even if you intercept him, you can't catch him. How do you live? He sends us money by mail. A kind of salary. His sister wants for nothing. I see to everything else. I'm very fond of that girl. I even sent her to school but she didn't want to stay on. He lets her do what she wants He dotes on her. He gives her what she wants, except... What? That... She's a lovely girl, but she can't get enough! You can hear that Can I go in? Go, Your friend is probably exhausted anyway. I can't hear anything now. - Go in the kitchen. - Ok, I'm going. Come here. - Everything ok? - Sure. Hold on I'll make you some' egg-nog. I'll make enough for your friend too. Thanks. Careful! - Be quiet, He is pissed off. - With us? - And the flowers? - It's not the right moment. Here. - After you. - No, after you. Get inside. I cannot be held responsible for you anymore. Killing the Rici gang in that way was shocking. I had a frightening meeting with Police HQ. When I took you on, your tests showed a slight tendency towards delinquency. - That's why you took us on. - in fact. It's incomprehensible that two people with your characteristics have chosen to be Police. I'm starting to have doubts. I'm not sleeping at night, I didn't sleep much before. I'm not giving you other jobs, just the Pasquini case. This is the address of the club by the sea. Don't go and smash up everything. We made sure the other club closed down. - Sure, you burnt thirty cars! - They were insured. - Not against vandalism. - They aren't covered ? Pasquini will have opened other clubs and we'll need months to find them. - We'll need a lead. - Of course. But it has to be sure a sure lead... needs preparation. Five thousand Lira on the knight, Give me five back. - Put yours down too. - And give me that five. Don't start again. You'll pay this time. Keep your hair on, I always pay! - May I? - Sure. Police! I don't know anything, I'm a club member. The Police are here! Who's been grassing? Keep going! Dick-head, what are you waiting for? - I was waiting for you. - Let me go! Who the hell are you? You're breaking my arm. What a whistle you've got! Bibi must have heard you in Rome. Will you teach me? Where did they find this motley crue? I'm too good at this game. Seven in a row. How much commission are you on? - I think you're going to lose it. - Because I've got the king. Lucky bastard! It's class. Ok, a lucky, classy bastard. So, what's your commission then? Three? Five? Ten percent? - Do you want a re-match? - I won! So... Where is Roberto Pasquini... so-called Bibi? - Need a hand? - Yes my friend. Here I am. Who is Pasquini? We don't know where he is. Do what you like to us, but we can't say anything. - No? - We're two poor down and outs. We don't know anything. We're small fry, we don't mix with sharks. - With sharks. - Nice metaphor. Even if we did know something, we couldn't talk. He'd kill us our wives and children too. - You're right. - He wouldn't think twice. Stop! Why are these steps so steep? Thank you. Give me a good description. From head to toe. Hold on! Just a second. For sure two men, first they went to my house, then the club. I'm sure they're the same two who were at the other club. You must find them. I've been transferred, it's urgent. - I've just found out. - Sardinia or Sicily ? It was once a punishment to get sent to those places. Today, only the best are sent there. I'm going to a small town near Venice. I don't know anyone there, but I'll find you a contact. No, forget it. This time I'm out for good. You'll be out when find those two first. - A hare? - No. How many? Four. - I saw two. - Me too. Pasquini knows about you. Then someone's grassed on us. Only people from here know where we work out. Maybe someone spoke... but you could have been followed. It's not important. First you have to move house. Second, don't come here any more unless you want to end up like Guido. - Finally... - Get him before he gets us. - Go on, "Lightning"! - The other one's better. Now he'll take over. Come on, go! Here he comes! Piolo, don't run "Dazzler" tonight. He looks drugged. Heel. Come on. Hold him tight! Good "Lightning"! - Will you give me a dog for tonight? - Got nothing else to eat? - "Typhoon" didn't make his time. - Call for a prediction! Why did "Dazzler" come third? He's training... Bet on him, he'll win tonight. A hundred thousand Lira on Bibi. Bibi only wins with bastards who guarantee a win. I'm not a bastard so I'll say goodbye. - Why are you working here again ? - l have to eat. I prefer a quiet life though. Not an eternal one mind. Get out of here, I have to work. And don't come here asking about him again. Come and eat, you deserve it. Come on darlings. Why do you love Pasquini so much? You're making a big mistake. Personally speaking, l'd like to see him finished off by something that would make cancer look harmless. You've already earned 1OO.OOO Lira. My friend's given you 1OO.OOO Lira, as wanting him finished off, by a fate worse than cancer tells us you despise him. Give us the name of someone else for whom cancer isn't enough. You can cure cancer or other serious illnesses. Who wants to see Pasquini dead? You've earned 1OO.OOO Lira. One name... If you give it to us, we'll never cross paths again. We'll forget you exist. If the name is right, the 1 OO.OOO Lira is just an advance. This is enough money for me. We won't be seeing each other anymore. I know you stick to an agreement. Keep your word. I've got one for you, Bibi tore his eye out. Poor thing, he cried like a baby. From one eye only? Now you know what sort of type Proietti is. Bibi tore out as eye, pretty normal. Proietti is a drug head, falls over, shit for brains. He went back to one of Bibi's clubs after he'd been banned. He lost half a million Lira. Where can you find that kind of money to give back? If he finds 30.OOO Lira he'll buy morphine with it. Bibi will tear his other eye out. He's your best bet alright. - Where does he live? - Still in the same house. He's called Proietti. He lives in Biscione Road, number 5. - Supermen, want some advice? - No. Forget it, Stay out of Bibi's way. Forget it! Did you remember to get the bread? - No, l forgot. - I knew it! What can i do about it? - What do you want? - To come in. Proietti... I haven't done anything. We know. But since you've done nothing, How did you come by expensive stuff like this? Are you a cop? - What do you want? - Roberto Pasquini. Never seen him, never met him. I don't know when you met him, but the last time you saw him, you had two eyes. What's your friend up to? He's asking your husband some questions. I'm not going to arrest you even though you've got morphine here. - And here's half a million Lira too. - Why? You tell me. - What are you talking about? - Why am I giving you half a million? Why? - Bibi will take your other eye out. - Because I have to give him... That's right, half a million. So... So this is to pay off your debt and keep your other eye. Being blind makes life difficult. And then I'll give you another half a million. There. Seeing as you're an addict and a bit out of it half a million for you, and half a million for Bibi. - What have I got to do? - Sort your fucking business out. Do you know what that is? Take the money to Bibi... and let me know when and where. That's all. It's winter! But the sun is out. These Swedes are crazy. Have you brought the money? Is it clean ? Who did you nick it off? Get on. Come on, I'm not getting off. I want to give it to Bibi in person, I want to say sorry. I screwed up and I've paid for it, but I'm not a shit. Do you think he gives a fuck? Fuck off. - Want some? - No, thanks. She's a pure-blooded Swede. - Know where I won the money? - You mean you won?! Not from our club no one with debts get in and if they do, I lay them out. Two Sicilians have opened a club. Where? On the outskirts of Rome that news is just for Bibi though. As you like, I'll see him later. Take it for now Maybe Bibi will let you keep it. I'll call you when I hear from him, Get out of here. Hello? Is that you Proietti? Has Mario called you? - Bibi called me. - What did he say? He wanted the address of the club the place where I won the money. - And what did you say? - I gave him the address you told me. Does he want to see you? Yes, he wants to know who those two Sicilians are. - And then? - How many punters there were... if there were any of his regulars. Where does he want to meet you? - By the river, at three. - Where? Where I was earlier at the fishing boat. Go there and keep your cool, we'll be there too, bye. Keep calm... How the fuck can I keep calm ? You think Bibi's already checked the address? Sure, and he would have found an abandoned garage. Bibi hasn't long spoken to Proietti. Now it's two p.m. their appointment's at three. Maybe Pasquini hasn't had time. That's the risk. Mario's on his way, but go down anyway. Thanks. There's no one here. - Nothing? - Nothing. Bastard! It's turned out well again.
