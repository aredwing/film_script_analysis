Some guy was hurt at a sawmill in the mountains. They're bringing him in. What about tomorrow? I have to operate in Prague. Some people have all the luck. On Thursday, I'm all yours. I've got tickets to the theater. Damn. There's an emergency. - Dr. Littner? - Yes. - Hi, SIvek. - Evening, Richard. Richard. Good to see you. How's the patient? Holding on. By all rights, we should have lost him. You're his last chance. Suction. I'm off. I've got a long trip and can be of no more use here. Say goodbye to Richard and SIvek. I will. Goodbye. Elika? The patient needs blood immediately. - What type? - Yours. You can't always be lucky. - I've done it before. - Exactly. No one expects it of you. Maybe you've had enough. Lose the envelope if there's trouble. - There won't be. - Fine. Let's go over it again, then. A four-story corner building. With exits into two streets. I use the one by the post office... second floor, first door. - When do you enter? - Just after 5:00 p. m. Two names on the door: Emlie Fojtkovand AleDobransk. At 5:03 p. m., I'll hear a vacuum cleaner turn on inside. I slip the envelope in the slot and exit by the other door. Good. Always the same game. It's getting boring, gentlemen. SHELTER FOR NON-ARYANS to the public shelter POST OFFICE Thank you. Excuse me, may I use your bathroom? Of course. Let me just get the light. Thank you. We saw you come in. Are they searching apartments? Not yet. Wouldn't you like to lie down? No, thank you. I just felt a bit dizzy. It's okay. Thirsty, Mr. Janda? You're my personal patient. I must take good care of you. - You need to drink. - Thank you, Doctor, ma'am. I already told you, I'm not a doctor yet. How could I be, since they closed the school? And I'm no ma'am, either. You'll have to wait for both. We're releasing you soon. Would you like to write your family? No family? I know about having no folks, or not knowing about them. - Mr. Kukalik, how'd you sleep? - Good. Good heavens! Sitting there like a ghost. Where's Richard? - What're you doing here, SIvek? - You have to leave. What? Here's money, ration coupons, New York papers, all documents. - New personal data. Commit it to memory. - Are you crazy? No. The Gestapo got Fojtkovand Dobransk. They may talk. Tonight, you're taking an ambulance to Krenovice. What will I do there? Continue on by train with Janda, the man you donated blood to. You can't return here anymore. And Richard? I need to see him... - Impossible. Get packed and go. - I want to hear it from him. Richard's gone. He emigrated. Nonsense! No one can emigrate. Tell me the truth. I can take it. - That's what we counted on. - Damn it, this isn't possible! It is possible! Richard emigrated and left you this. He took off and left me this? I'm supposed to believe that? This wasn't part of the game! Am I the only one who didn't know? No one knew, and everyone did. And everyone was ready but me! Please, be quiet. Your relationship was public... so we'll say you emigrated, too. The Gestapo will probably buy it. - Where will you go? - Don't worry. Give me your keys. - I'm going home. - No! You can't be seen. Give me your keys. What do I do now? Learn your new identity. There, there, sweetie, don't tremble. - SIvek, come with me. - Pull yourself together. You'll get your bag in Tynec, some clothes, and personal stuff. Dr. Bencek will have it. He's the man who brought Janda in. Nothing to be afraid of. He'll guard you with his life. Bencek vouched for him. - What's he wearing? - The shoes and pants are his. The coat, shirt, and briefcase are mine. There's food in it. A towel and some soap. I left some photos at Richard's place. Don't worry, I'll clean up. Bye, Elika. I'm a doctor. I'm carrying medicine and food for the sick. Here's the receipt and inventory. - And this? - Personal belongings. Personal belongings? And this? Hardly yours. They are a bit small. I have some old clothes for the patients. They have so little. They're lucky to have you. You may go. I'll leave the bag in the train. Joza? That's what they call you, isn't it? You know the danger I'm in. I've got to hide, and I don't know for how long. You have to forget who I was. Now I'm Hana Hofmanov. - Didn't Dr. Chldek tell you? - He did, miss. We needn't be so formal. My name's Hana. - Your hands are like ice, miss. - "Miss"? Your hands are like ice, Hana. Your hands are like ice, Hana. - We're here. - Where? dovHut'. Watch out for the mud, miss. Must you be so formal? No. You'll have to stay here a bit till I find something else. We can't stay at my old place... but I'll find an empty cottage. You have empty cottages? From those who left or died. You didn't die? No. Waiting for your beau? For Lipka, and he's not my beau. He got caned again yesterday. Did a fairy save you? She's one of us. Helenka. She's ena Bojarov's. She can stay a few days, Joza, if we're good enough for her. - I'm not asking any questions. - Good idea. I'll talk to the principal about her. So you made it back. You look better than before. elary-celery, chicken shit smellery... Why are they teasing her? She's from elary. That's why. Thank you. You scared me. You've acted very dangerously. SIvek wouldn't have sent me here if he'd known. He's dead. The Gestapo came for him. And if they catch you, they'll execute everyone who helped you, including me. I'm taking you back. You'll go to elary, marry Janda... and I won't hear about you again. A fairy saved Joza Janda. I saw her. No such thing as fairies. A plane! German. Flying in the clouds. And she is too a fairy. You're just a stuck-up brat! For the last time... who stole boards from Burda's fence? Confession eases the soul. Lipka, come with me to my office. If he beats you again, bite another one of his fingers. The cane solves nothing. dovHut' is in a rut Chicken shit, stinky butt Kids from the Hut' Like to shake their butt Better hope Lipka doesn't wring your necks! Are you happy? Trying our patience? You think it's worth the beating, don't you? Beat it. Get out of my sight. Out! - You got punished? - Not today. Nice of the principal to let you off. He didn't. When he beats me, he lets me off. You're with Joza? Joza from the sawmill? Yeah, that's right. I assumed you knew you couldn't just waltz around like this. I don't want to see you outside, or talking to the children. Children can't keep secrets, and they're my responsibility. Take your things back inside and wait till they come for you. Library Come in. - Praise Jesus. - Forever and a day. Can't sleep, either? I can't sleep since she's been here. - What do you want? - I came to thank you for Lipka. It was nothing. You maintain strong discipline. The last principal couldn't compare. But that's the only thing I've accomplished with the cane. Most of the kids here are headed for the gallows. That's where we're mistaken. A child's soul is a flower bud. Then what hemlock did Lipka bloom from? Though he'll be gone soon, I'm still telling his stepfather. Don't. Save your compassion for those who need it. His stepfather will kill him. What about your conscience then? What makes you think I have one? Please rethink this. I'm applying for a transfer. Come in. Lord keep us. Sorry to disturb you. I'd like to speak to the priest. - Have you come for her? - Yes, Principal. Let's go outside. Thanks for everything. There's not much furniture, but I'll make some soon. There's a kitchen, bedroom, front room, shed. Lucka lives up there, ena next to her. And Juriga lives down below. Where's the yard? Everywhere. There's no electricity, but you'll get used to it. Have a seat. I have to take the horse back to the mill. It'll be warm soon. Sit closer to the stove. That's Azor. Now I've got two guards. Tea will be ready soon. Tomorrow's Saturday. I arranged the wedding without banns. The priest will help register you... in elary and with the parish. I'd like to wash and go to bed. Good night. - This is ena Bojarov. - Good morning. Get out of here! ena will dress you. What for? I think I'm capable. You need different clothes. My clothes are fine. - You can't get married in them. - What's that supposed to mean? You're all so sure I'm marrying Mr. Janda, but maybe I'm not. There's no other way. Then I'll just go, and your troubles will be over. - You've got nowhere to go. - Are you all mad, or am I dreaming? You're not telling me what I can and cannot do. Sorry. I told you to stay outside. How will you make me? There's no other way. They wouldn't accept you. Why don't we eat something? Cheers. What's that? Clothes from the theater group we had here. You could use this wig and this dress... or this one. My clothes are fine. I don't need to dress like a clown. - You can't wear them. - Why? The local people... and because of your hair, too. My hair? Wear this until your hair grows out. They're coming! Morning! Good morning! I assume you don't have a recent copy of your birth certificate? Will you try to get one later? I suppose you have no idea what I'm to use to register you? Your presence here in elary is forcing me to commit fraud. I hope, at least, you are aware of that. I am in an unenviable position. I can turn you in... and endanger all those who have helped you. Or I can marry you and pray that no one else turns you in. God help you from being arrested. Well, I hope you're single, at least. At the ceremony, I have to ask three questions. I'd like the answers now. "Do you enter into matrimony willingly?" - Yes. - Yes. "Are you under pressure to marry?" - No, not at all. - Not at all. "Do you wish to have offspring?" What will you say before witnesses? Yes. Yes. Fine. I'd like to pray before the ceremony. Alone. Thank you, Father. Thank you. Forest, forest, oh, forest green Come, lass, I'm home alone Home alone, all are at mass Come to my bed, come, my lass Sorry, but I don't know how to dance like this. Don't worry, I'm drunk, too. You have a fine wife, Joza! You whore! Stop that! Leave her alone! Stay the hell out of it, you dirty slut. He hit you again? You should've killed him! Can I sleep here? The bench is hard. I have to tell you something. I was unfaithful to you. Not today, before. Down in dovHut'. With Ira, the one you stayed with. How could it matter? She's used to sleeping with me. I don't mind. Hello. Hello. I'm not used to the stove. I'm helping mow Juriga's meadow tomorrow. Then they'll help us with the floor. Morning. - Pretty here, huh? - You're right about that. Police are scarce around here. The Germans use a back road. So I heard. You're safe here. And there's no reason to be afraid of us. I asked myself, "Where'd she find that old goat?" He's lived alone for years. Then one day all those logs fall on him, near kill him... and he comes back with a young girl... who doesn't suit him at all. I met Joza at the hospital. A person has to wonder what a young city thing... would see in such an old goat. What's there to like? Various things come to mind: Maybe she doesn't like him, just needs a place to hide. Someplace far away where no one will find her. Get your hands off me, you pig! Oh, don't worry. We'll have more chances to dance. Lunch! - Afternoon. - Afternoon. Sit. Him, too. Enjoy the meal. I broke the lamp. It doesn't matter. I'll tell young Juriga. He'll bring another from dovHut' tomorrow. You'll like it. You'll see. Don't cry. You'll have a new one tomorrow, Hanulka. - Shouldn't I call you that? - You can. That lamp doesn't matter. You're not mad, Joza? I brought you some books from dovHut'. The priest said you might like them... that they might help with boredom. So that's your plan. If I read, I won't touch anything. Thanks. Azor, stay. Evening, Mr. Janda. May we come in? - What's your business? - I need to sort out some papers. - God keep us. - Evening. Sorry to disturb you, ma'am. Have a seat. Bring drinks for the guests. We have to register you, ma'am. I'll need to see your papers. Fill this out: Address, name, age. Born 1924? If you were single, you'd have gone to work in the Reich, eh? Too bad we didn't meet her before Mr. Janda did. Any domestic animals? Cross it out then. Here's a voucher for ration coupons. And we're all through. Sign it, please. Respect the blackout. No lights at night. Good night. Farewell. I'll teach you how to do it. Good afternoon. Hello, kids. - Hello, Principal. - Hello. What can I get you? Run out of honey? No. I just wanted to ask... Do you know your Helenka is friends with Lipka? Of course, everyone knows. - You've given your permission? - I haven't forbidden her. He's not a good influence. Helenka is an intelligent child. She could already start school. But Lipka is a loser, a hoodlum. He grew up fatherless, and his stepfather drinks. - Helenka has no father, either. - Yes, but she's sensitive. But under Lipka's influence... she's obstinate and standoffish. It seems the opposite to me. You realize that Lipka will become an outcast and a thug. What boy is better? He's like a wolf. You don't know him as I do. It's appalling. Threats and beatings? Like water off a duck's back. But I do know him. They're my kids. - Not Lipka. - He's Helenka's brother. - What? - Milk brother. What's that? I nursed him when his mother lost her milk... after I'd lost Matuek. Milk brother, eh? That's right, Principal. As you wish, Mrs. Bojarov. I was concerned about Helenka. I can see how busy you are, so I won't detain you. - God keep you. - And you. The floor's ready. Come have a look, Hanulka. You bastard! No, Daddy! - You don't lift a finger at school or at home! - No, Daddy! Michal! Get off! Don't come back, you freeloader! Why do you hound him? Must he sneak home like a thief? This isn't his home! I don't want to see your bastard again! - Going to town tomorrow? - Yes. I need a couple of things. - I can't read this. - Soap. I need it for laundry and... I didn't want to say it, but you could use it occasionally. We'll go together. I shouldn't be seen. I'd like to show you to my mother. I'd like to tell her I married. You have a mother? I was in elary to see Lipka's stepfather. Now something for you. I'm worried about him, about Lipka. I'm afraid that brute will nearly kill him. I wanted it, wanted that animal to be an extension of my arm. Now tell me who's the bigger brute. Who will God's wrath strike? Sometimes I envy your pure soul. You're wrong. I know. Even saints sin. Seven times a day, isn't it? May I touch you? Yes. Okay, children... who can name 10 forest creatures? A flea. What are you doing here? And a frog, a worm, a snail, a wasp, a rabbit, and a bear. That's seven. Okay, a badger, an owl, and a trout. - You like school? - It's pouring outside. - Who taught you that? - Lipka. He knows them all. He should be here, not you. I'm here instead of him. He's not coming again. Ever. It stopped raining. My goat must be completely soaked. Let's continue! AUTUMN 1943 Get into your little cottage. You'll be warm there in winter. Azor. Joza. Well, shit. You look frightened. This is Lucka Vojnikov. - What is it? - Drink up. There was a swamp and an old house. She got all the way to the old mill. I'm glad you didn't go there. You can't get through the bog. I saw someone there. Water, Joza. Thoroughly. Her legs are full of thorns. So pull them out. Dry her off and lay her on the table. Hold her. - Joza? - Yeah? I saw something else when I got lost in the woods. There was a house burning. That was the gamekeeper's lodge. The Germans burned it. The gamekeeper hid partisans. They killed them all. No, just the gamekeeper's family. The partisans escaped and left them there. I saw them. All dead. Don't wander so far from here ever again. I really don't want to die now. They won't find you here, Hanulka. They haven't so far. Winter's coming. We'll be scraping snow off the windows. Still sulking, grumpy? Your mom sent this so you won't starve. You've got to come get it yourself. I'm not traipsing over to you. I'd just drown in all your crap anyway. Winter's coming, so quit your sulking. Go home to your mother. Or you'll croak here. Are you here? Can you hear me? You been here the whole time? Come on. - Teacher's sending the cops after you. - Let him just try. Lucka says winter will chase you home anyway. - Look what fell from heaven. - What is it? Try it. Keep your mouth shut about me, and it's yours. - What have you got there? - I won't tell. Lipka said it's a secret that fell from heaven. How is he? Really great. He's not cold, and stuff falls from heaven. Can you eat it? I'm famished. You can't try it. It's secret. Good morning. You can keep it for yourself. Close your eyes. Both of you. Open your mouths. If it's frozen cat crap... As beautiful as in church, and it's from heaven, too. But it's better than the Lord's body the priest gives us. If he passed this out on Sunday, the place would be packed. No more for you. You don't pray enough. Thank you. Joza? You promised me a dance. Don't hesitate, or you'll miss out. Last piece. Last piece. Hey, you in there. I've got something. Want some, too? But you have to get it now. If you don't come out, I'll eat the last piece myself. Not a word, or I'll turn you both in. Joza! Run get Lucka! She's at the church. He broke my arm! Didn't it ever seem odd? What's she doing here? Where'd she come from? Where'd that old goat find her? You don't realize the danger we're all in? Slut! Just wanted a bit firsthand. Anything happens to her, we know where to go. Remember, Michal! He's bleeding like a stuck pig. They can sew him up in town. I'll do it myself. But not here. At home. You can come birthing with me. Your talents are wasted here. Joza, it seems to me they didn't trim you properly. Your ears are like fly swatters, and the asymmetry bugs me. - I think I'll cut one off. - Go ahead. I found you out. You want me to maim my husband. I'll strangle you for that. Go ahead. Don't provoke me. Choke your own self if you want. But bear in mind, I'll bump you off if you do. Where's the gun? Gun. Azor's training rabbits with it. Oh, God, if I burn lunch tomorrow, I'll hang myself. Will you pound in a nail for me? The nail's already in. From last time. If it's Joza, I'm not here. What happened? My mom's bleeding. She fell. - Grandma won't call for help. - Hanulka, hurry. ena, go for Joza. We may need him. No one knows I came to get you. Mom's hurting bad and Dad's drunk. She miscarried. Who let her just lie here all day? All because your precious boy's too spoiled to feed the stock? His arm's bust. Can't pitch hay. He drank away the pain. Ma said he got beat up at the mill. Too scared to go out now. What did that hag say? Praying hard she'll soon be rid of her nightmare? What do you mean? We care about Aninka. No one invited you. You did, you nag, you old cow. Hear what she said? I'll get the doctor. It's even too late for the priest. Get some sheets. And you, get the sled fast. - She's dying. - I know. We have to take her down the hill. Take the boy away. He can't help. Take him home. Joza, stop! I'll go down for the priest. You were right. It was useless. That didn't matter. Evening, Father. It's almost morning. Did we wake you? - I couldn't sleep anyway. - We're frozen stiff. ena, why don't you remarry? Helenka and I are doing fine. Right? Dona! Heel! Come out! - It's you. - That your dog? She's mean. Her old master beat her. Now she hates people. We've just had her a short time. Vermin come sniffing around. Leave her alone, she's a beast! Dona, get over here! It's okay, Dona. It's okay, don't be scared. Come, wash and have something to eat. If you chop wood for us, you can come eat when you're hungry. I'd appreciate the help. She can't anymore. Water! Water! Hanulka! ena's strange. Just smiles, doesn't say much. She's self-sufficient. And what about Vojta? Vojta Juriga? He's a tomfool who doesn't know what to do. But ena does. He only does what she lets him. Afternoon. That was young Gorkov. I thought she disappeared. Nothing just disappears off the mountain. There's always tracks. She left her brutal husband to live with her father-in-law. - I don't get it. - Why not? How could they hide it so long? Her husband went looking for her. They hid nothing. Think they really live together? She's in her sixth month! Chamomile. Cinquefoil. Buckthorn. St. John's-Wort. Comfrey. Mugwort? Buckthorn? Hot. That baby is mine! It's mine! You can keep the whore, but the baby is mine! Baby thief! I'll be back for it! Close your eyes. You're beautiful. What? You are. Now you. About you? You are... What? - An old hag. - Oh, you! You think you've got me tamed, but I have other plans. - I'm going to finish med school. - I also have big plans. - Which include me? - Yes. What? It's a secret. Tell me. We'll buy some sheep. That holy night, shepherds stood under the heavens... taking turns watching their flocks. A great light suddenly appeared... and a mighty angel of the Lord stood before them. They were overcome with fear... but the angel said unto them, "Fear not... " He says we're to stand and go outside. Everyone. For hiding an enemy of the Reich... death! Spring 1945 - Praise the Lord. - May he bless us. I got it out by the bridge. Seemed sad to let it float away. That's not a doll. It's Winter, the goddess. Now maybe winter won't end. You believe such stuff? You're dripping. They'd beat me up if they saw me with it. - I need to dry it someplace. - You do deserve a beating. - Indeed, it's a sin. - I'll repent in confession. - God knows you're not sorry. - I'm just tricking him a little. You can only trick yourself and forfeit his forgiveness. - Does God know everything we think? - Everything. Here, help me with these. It's all hopeless if he knows everything. Are your thoughts pure? It's enough to know they're not. You're right, spring is here. Let Winter float away or stand in a corner, right? Run along. Soldiers! Soldiers are coming! - Cheers! - Cheers! To our liberators! Cheers! You look like my sister. - What? - Sister. Cheers. What're you doing, you jerk? I'll shoot you! - Just having fun, old man. - Fun? To victory. - Laughing at me? - Yeah. I'm walking straight. It's shameful and the field mice can see you. - I'm going no further. - I am. What if I run away? You won't today. I'm on your conscience. Can't drink or walk, but wants to run. - Put me down. Wait, you're panting. - Stop squirming. - You're going to bust. - Now you're free. You can go. You're laughing at me again. Where could I go? I'm not budging. I mean tomorrow. In a week. - Maybe someone's waiting. - No one's waiting for me. No one. Roman? Is this her? She's pretty. I told you you'd like her. You're beautiful. I like you. What's your name? Sorry. It'll be fine. I'm Vasya. Understand me? What are you doing, you whore? Stop, you bastard. I'll show you. Swine! Fascist! Fucking fascists! Killed my brother. I'll kill them all! - Where is it? - Over the hill! Let's go! Move! - I'm on your side. - Back! Get down! I'm a friend. For the love of God. You idiot! That was a priest. He's not a German. You killed him. Let's get out of here! No one will find you here. Wait for me. Don't go. Sorry, Mother. I'm Sashka. Sorry. Stop, you idiot! And take your hands off me! Let's have a drink. Thank you, Mother. Thank you. Mommy! Help, they're killing her! Help. Azor! Seek, Azor! My God. Careful. God keep us. - Let me do it. - Here's sheets for bandages. Azor, slow down. Put him down here, Joza. Give me more. - Joza. - It's okay. Grab it. And Vojta? Where's Vojta? Azor? Azor! Quiet! Joza! They aren't fascists, Comrade Lieutenant. Germans? Where? These are our people. I know them. Don't shoot! They're all our people. Careful here. Follow me. Come, the boy knows the way. These are our people. Hurry! Help with the wounded. Get a move on! Bring a stretcher. Careful. You'll be fine. Joza? Doctor! It's okay. Let me give him a little hug. A lovely future soldier. Lucka. It can't be. Hanulka? Oh, Lucka. Is it really possible? You're alive? I'm none too sure. I'm none too sure at all.
