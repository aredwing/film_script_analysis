Little silvery feelin'. The call of the wild. Is this the guy? Is who what guy? The guy. The guy that was supposed to be Zora's father but isn't, Because... you know. Yeah. That's my husband Charles. Charlie. Looks nice. Was he nice? Yeah, he was nice. Never remarried? Tthh. No. I mean, What's the point? Yeah. Yeah, I'm divorced. Twice. Right now, I'm... Living with someone. Mmm... Never had any children. Huh. That Zora, looks like a nice kid. Ohh, she's a great kid. I don't know what I would've done without her. Family really is the way to go. I live to enjoy myself. Funny thing--Sperm. Well, what do we got here? "Jesus was a black man." Well, hell, at least you got yourself a point of view. Must be a real bummer having a half-White kid. Fuck you. Apparently we already did that. You know what? Get out. For being such a free spirit, You are surprisingly uptight. You, not surprisingly, are a pain in the ass. It turns out, that I have a daughter That I'd never even heard about. You don't have a daughter. I have a daughter. You have a car dealership. I thought we straightened all this out. Fine by me. But are you sure it's fine with her? She's the one that hunted me out. Maybe she wants to see me. I don't think so. I was always good at math and science. Maybe I had something to do with that part. You had nothing to do with it. Nothing. Do you understand me? I understand you, your highness. I can't talk to you anymore. It's ok. I'm outta here. Mm-Hmm. Have a nice life. I will. Hi. Hi. Ok. What's up? You think he's my father? Look... All he was was some sperm With one motivated swimmer. That's all. I just wish I could've asked him a few questions. Why? The man is so dumb, what was he gonna tell you? Forget it. It's over. Leave it alone. I know, ma, but you don't-- Please. I really don't want to talk about this anymore. Ok. Ma, just one thing. What? When you were alone with him, Did he say anything about me? Is it really that important to you? Yes. Well, yeah, he did. He said, uh... That you seemed really smart... And really confident. He also said he thought you were really beautiful. Really? Yeah. Really? I cross my heart, yeah. That's cool. Good night. Good night, my daughter. I love you. I love you, too. It's not true... But it's cool. This is Hal Jackson of Jackson motors, Asking you to bear in mind There's a reason so many people come to us For deals on cars and trucks. Ugh, god.

You know something? If you did lose your business, You could always take the time To explore your artistic side. Like I always thought you had the hands Of somebody who could be a surgeon Or play the violin or something. But Stacy, honey-- I know what you're going to say. Nobody listens to the violin anymore. And that's true, but you could make them do it By playing it in a whole new way, Like, for example, more bluesy, perhaps, Or... Rap! Rap! Rap! Rap even! You could do it Like a--Oh. Oh, sorry. I--Oh. Your head hurts, doesn't it? Do you want me to, um, Maybe sing you a song or something? Ok. No. No, please don't. It's a very nice song. Music can be so healing. This is the song. Ohh.

I'm not good at, you know, receiving, And so I don't want you to think That I don't like it. Which in your language means thank you. Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. "The world is waiting for you, "And here are a few maps In case you get lost along the way. Hal." Thank you. You're welcome. Well, yeah. Well, I guess I ought to be going. I'll walk you out.

I'm just checking. Hey, Diego, what are you doing here? Me, boss? What are you doing here? Hi. I'm-- I'm Zora's mother. Hi. I'm Diego. Very nice to meet you. Thank you. Behave yourself. Hi. Wow. Oh, thank you. Shall we? Yes. Bye. You look great. And so do you. She's wearing that? That's exactly what I've been sayin'! Thank you.

Oh, I love to dance. Bye, now. Do you know him? Yeah, yeah. He works for me. So if anything happens-- I'll fire his ass. Ok. So, what's up, baby? You want to slide out for a minute? Well, no, I really shouldn't. Come on, baby. We'll go see a movie or something. Well, I'm just not really ready For a commitment. I just want to take you out. I said no! Bitch! Yo' motha! Well--Ha ha. You probably have plans For the evening. Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna... Go out and grab something. What are you gonna grab? Eat. I want to eat. If you don't have any plans, You can come along. Do you want me to come? Yeah. I think I do. Ok. Well, then, I don't have any plans. You know something? You could have said that right off the bat. Yeah, but you could've just asked me to dinner. I have to go change. Hey, where's the, uh... Where's the rice and the noodles And the fella that flips the shrimp Into his hat? I shouldn't have ever let you order. Half this stuff still looks alive. That's the whole idea. You know what? When she was 7, I gave her one of those Suzy homemaker oven things. They come with mixes. You're supposed to make stuff. Not her. She was not interested. All she wanted to do Was melt stuff in the oven. She gets that from me. I only use my oven to dry my sneakers. I believe that. Hmm. Hmm. What the hell. No! No! Uh-Oh. Oh, shit. No, you're not supposed to eat it like that. Oh, God. Oh, God. You know, Jackson-- I'll buy you another one. This is ours. Here. Drink this. Are you ok? Oh, shit. I just-- He--He ate a Wasabi ball. I'm fine. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to laugh, But you're so funny. I know that... now. You-- Maybe just a little more. She just told you, silly move, white man. Are you all right? I'm fine. You sure? Mm-Hmm. You know, you're-- You're all glisteny. I think it's from the Wasabi. You might want to try the crab next time. It's a little safer. Yeah. No, next time, I'm ordering. That's what's happening. The only thing I can ride is a horse. Not once have we shot a horse commercial. It's crazy. That's probably because You'd look too good on a horse. They've got to make you look Like a wild man. That's part of the appeal. Really? Yeah. I never thought of it that way. You smell good. What? You smell good. It's just this lotion i'm using. May I? May you what? Smell you. Thought you already did that. Oh, wow. Oh, I could get lost in that smell. I could just close my eyes, And no one would ever find me. Oh, no. Somebody would find you. Maybe you could send up a flare. You smell like that everywhere? I really don't know. I'm not in the habit of smelling myself. I can check for you. You're really something, you know? I'm just, you know, I'm not used to this kind of stuff. Is this how you sell trucks? It's not like we haven't been properly introduced. I don't mean to be crass, But my sperm has been in your body. And where it goes, You figure you should follow. Well, generally I like to go first, But the little fellas got there before me. Oh. Uh-Huh. We have had the child, Sarah. We didn't have a child, Hal. I had a child. I'd like to make that up to you. I just bet you would. This could get complicated. Don't worry. I've done it before. I'll bet you have. Oh, yeah, you're slick. I'll change. No. Don't. What should I do? Smell me. Mm. Mm! Mmm! Mm! Hello. Diego, stop. What's wrong? I better go home. It's getting late. Let's go to my place. You could stay over. Are you crazy? My mother would kill me. Look, Diego, I hardly know you. Let's get to know each other better. Please. Please. What was that? It was just the bed. Just the bed. Oh, Jesus. It's Zora. Oh. Where's my hat? I got your shoe. I don't know. Where? Right here. Where's my damn hat? My other shoe. Oh. Oh, jeez. They're right behind me. Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the hurry? They're outside. Oh. Every time you squeeze thigh master-- Hey. Hi, honey. Hi. Squeeze your way to shapely thighs. We're watching TV. Look at that. Oh, it's late. Time got away. Thigh master is designed To isolate and strengthen these muscles. What happened to the lamps? I guess they fell over. I'll be darned. Yeah, well, what were you watching on tv? Studs. Talk show. Well-- Talking. They were talking. Studs talking together. Ok. Hey, huh? Well-- Boss. Hal junior. Jesus. Oh. All right. Here we go. All right. We're out of here, Diego. Good night, Hal.

You lay a hand on that girl, And I'll kill you personally. Whoa. What's it to you? I'll tell you what it is to me. She's my daughter. Daughter? Oh, hell. I bet you I'm late. Good night, Diego. Oh, I'm tired. So what did you do? What? You heard me, ma. What were you guys doing? Doing? Nothing. So that's why the house looks Like a cyclone hit it? What are you talking about? You told me to stay away from him, But you can do Whatever you want with him? Zora-- This is my father, ma, And he needs me, not you. My whole entire life, You brought me up with this fantasy, This ghost of Charlie, Then I finally bring home something real, And you want to take that away from me! What are you... What is going on? Ma, I wanted this for me, not you. When this doesn't work out Between the two of you, Where is that gonna leave me? Sorry I got hung up, sweetheart. Oh, hi, Hal. You remember Bruce, don't you?

What did she say? It doesn't matter what she said. This would be easier if you were a parent. Then I could explain it. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What is this? Something feels really off here. Well... Look, Zora's really upset, And you couldn't see her upset For any longer Than you could take it. This is as long As I could take it for. All right. Let me talk to her, all right? What are you gonna say? Huh? You gonna explain-- What you gonna say? Hey, what's the big deal? Come on, Hal, what was this? This was nothing but some kind of... Some kind of what, Sarah? Well, just some sort of... You know, attraction, Some... weird old attraction. Let's just get out of it Before somebody gets hurt. All right. Oh. Ok. I see what this is.

We're looking for a Sarah Mathews. Sir, Sarah Mathews, please. Are you family? This is her daughter. She came into E.R. This morning. We're sustaining her vital signs. She has a concussion, and she's still unconscious. We operated on her leg this afternoon. Ma. She's going to be ok, right, doctor? The next 48 hours are critical.

It's gonna be ok. Did you see that doll in here right before you? Mm-Mm-Mm. Coffee with just the right touch of cream. Whoo, was she hot. My palms are still sweating. Blue jeans and red top? Her butt was a 10. You saw her? She's my daughter. And the interesting thing is she's ab-Negative. That's not very common. Well, she's an unusual girl. She won a science award last year. State contest. First prize. You don't say. Oh, shit. I mean, it was really an awful fight, And then... Well, I guess it's just what you're afraid of-- That you'll--You'll yell at someone And fight with them, And then they'll die or whatever. I know. I Had a fight with her, too, though, So we'll never really know Which fight got her run over. One thing we do know is, Neither one of us can ever fight with her again, Which is too bad because she's so damn good at it. Yeah. Hal, you can fight with me. You just can't win. Hi. Hi. Well, look. You brought the asshole. My foot hurts. I think she's ok. Well, maybe I oughta leave you ladies alone for a second, Go home and grab some clothes. I'll be back real soon. Ok.

Bruce is a hell of a lot better for you. I don't think you understand What I'm trying to stay. It's over between us, So don't try and stop me. Ok. I won't. What happened to us, Hal? Aw. Where did we go wrong? I mean, we were going to buy a dog together! A terrier... Or maybe--Maybe a lab. Boy, I sure am lucky I found out about you Before we wrecked his little life Or we had to fight over splitting him up. Let's not keep Bruce waiting, all right, honey? Yeah. Ok. Bye-Bye. Don't hate me, Hal. Please don't hate me. I want you to just remember the good times. I want you to remember the way we were. Ok. I will. Bye-Bye. Thank you, honey. Ooh! Hal! Hal, you'll find somebody else! I know you will! Maybe not right away, But in the long run this is best. You know, someday I think you'll thank me. It's going to take him a long time To get over this. We're talking years. Bye. Poor dude. Bye. Bye, Hal! Oh, God. Good morning. Just the man I need to see. I need to talk to you. Sure. Hello, darlin'. Hi, Mr. Jackson. Hey. Come here. Come here. Quick, quick, quick, quick. Go ahead. Go ahead. Ma. What's going on? I won a Westinghouse science award. They only give out 10 each year. That's 10 in the whole country. Yes, and the principal's gonna give it to me Next week at graduation. Isn't that something? I'm telling you, This is our baby. Our baby's getting this award. Yes, they'll give me a trophy or something, And they'll pay for my whole college tuition. Congratulations, sweetheart. That's wonderful. Thank God. How about that, huh? What's wrong? Well, I just-- I've just come from the hematology lab. Ooh. Why? Well, that's where they keep all our blood. You're type "A," Sarah. Sweetheart, they want you to give some more blood. You're AB-Negative, And that's kind of rare. And they took some of mine, too. And i'm "O." You couldn't be. They did it twice, honey, And i'm "O." Wait a minute. What are you sayin'? Well, it turns out That I'm not her father. But I got the name from mom's file. They had your name at the sperm bank. I know that, sweetheart. I called. I talked to the fella That runs the place. He said the files were done by hand Up until about 10 years ago When they... Sent 'em overseas To be put on computer disks. When they came back, they were messed up. Well, I jus-- How can they do that to people? I'm afraid that the most You're ever gonna know Is that the donors came From the university. Mostly science majors. You're not my father. No. I made a mistake. I made a horrible, horrible mistake. Should I go talk to her? Mm-Mmm. No. She just--She just has to be alone For a while. Well. Well. I guess you probably want to go back To work or something. You probably need your rest, huh? Yeah. Ok, then. I, uh... I don't think I thanked you For being there for Zora and... me. I wanted to be there. I got to go to Las Vegas tomorrow. Ahem. I have a dealer's convention. Sounds fun. It's work. I'll call you when I get back. Ok. Sarah, I'm sorry. Me, too. Hey!

And I'm sure she's going to make their heads spin Just like she did ours. There are certain people That just bring out the best in others, And, well, as you all know, I ain't one of them peoples. But Zora Mathews is, And that's why I take great pleasure In presenting this Westinghouse award To my best friend Zora Mathews. They said I should say something. If I've done well in school, It's because I got the message at home That learning was important. I'd like to accept this award In the name of my mother.
