Come here! - Benigno! - Hello, Jose! - How you doing? - Well, what about you? - Well. - Come here! - Joseph! - Dear Benigno... - How are you? - Do you? - Well. We never see. Have you grown a beard? - It's nice, is not it? - Bravo! Remember how much fun we had children? And now... - How are things going? - Mal, unfortunately. I do not know what happens I lose all the sheep. Remember the flock that was? I have done witchcraft. The lose! Every day I have ten less. I lost everything. I can only... this... I lost the last! No more being a pastor. Sorry. Need a herd? I wish! - Hey, are you free tonight? - Yes, why? - Is that Mary and I are dinner guests... - Mary and you? - Yes, do you remember her? - Your wife. - Long time no see... How are you? - Well, thank you. Then we have to leave our son just... Son? How? - Do not you had a girl? - No child. - Child? - Jesus. - Jesus? - It's a clever, a demon! - His name is Jesus? - Yes - How beautiful! - I understand, you want me to look after him. - Yes - One night you have to visit, Mary and you. - Sure. And the other child and will care. Go, I'll take care. Thanks, Benigno. Mary, come! Benigno care for Jesus. Joseph, you've put on some weight. Smarrita! I lose all the sheep! Thanks, Benigno. You're welcome, Mary. Come on, Mary. Have fun! A child? Jesus! Jesus... Where are you? Jesus! He's hiding to scare me. Want to scare me, but you scare me to you! I Benigno, the foul fiend! What antique lamps so pretty! Jesus! Jesus! I am Satan Beelzebub, I'm looking for Jesus! Look how many things! If I had a child like you! But my Lazarus... is handsome, but is tremendous. I can not get out of bed. Every morning yelling: "Lazarus, walk! Arise!" Pretend to be dead and is in bed until 4. What "lassoed" dear Je... Jo... Joshua! Look how nice house has got your father! At first it seemed a... no offense, a little late. As children we joked, say, 'There's Jos! " I thought that neither marry, but has got a pretty wife, a nice house, a beautiful son... Jesus! Jesus! But where do you go? Now I can not think of anything to entertain... You are a child seriously! Dear Jesus, we are here I and "you"! You really... How old are you? Five! Bravo, in fact look it five. Did I tell you of when you were born? Beautiful! If you saw what a party! It had snowed all night. I brought your father a sheep and your mother. The sky was starry, seemed a manger. And people came from everywhere, must have a conference. They camels, black, Americans, Yugoslavs, Albanians, People everywhere! Seemed Carnival! I had fun. But it was Carnival, it was Christmas! You were born just for Christmas. On December 25 of the year zero. Just born in year zero, in fact Now we are in the 5 after Jesus. Yes. December 25,'re Capricorn. It is a good sign, even lucky. It is the sign of normal people the quiet life without Bravery. We will expect a fairly regular life, I'm happy for you. Dear Jesus, life is tough! Today to pull forward to do miracles! I'll give you some advice, Do not worry about politics, leave, do not get to give speeches to people. Religion is even worse. Priests are tremendous, are Pig... They are rotten, they effect the intestine. "Power, struggles, I'm a priest"... Go and... You drown, smother you in power, you know? You are strong, let not oppress. And if one gives you a slap, you give a punch gums, so do not give it back. Got it? Then I married a beautiful girl, local course beautiful, healthy, without inflammation and create a family. But then, do not marry soon, Enjoy life! Gzala at least until the Wine, dances, parties, drink, drop to the ground, that life is short. It has been off the fire! Is there some wood? This is the advice I can give myself. Right in the foot! But look how weird wood does your father! Want to make the horse? Do you know him? See, I always do with my son. The horse! Look what work I have to do! The horse is lame! Down! One, two, three! Enough, I give up! It's all dirty. Your parents tell you that I'm a pastor Dirty, used for the lambs. I soiled the lambs I wash them in the tub. Last cauldron, bathroom is ready! Come here, a good soaking! One, two, three... A good soaking... Down! Must be hard water. I I have water in my house softer, is low. Water is different. Look at water use here! What good! You swim in a strange style, the "Jesus style". Freestyle is a very free! Come! Down! But you're not a child, 're an inflatable boat. You know, people are strange that when he gets in the water falls. I have known children immersed in the water to fall. Which children so rare! Now wash you, but clean. It's a trick, right? I also do not know, even on ice! A wash well. Also my nephew Jude teases me. Usually, malignant, a snake! But it's good, it always gives me a kiss. Let's see... The head does not wash, and face either. The ear, the other... So what's here? Enough to dry. A dry! Bravo, ready. See how you were dirty, and do not want to wash! Come on, it's over the bathroom! Are you hungry? I like to have dinner. But unfortunately there is nothing. Well, I think there a fish. But only one. Who will eat it? Me? Thanks, very friendly. It is up to richer. Dinner is over, no more. Thank you. Look up! A private property! Look here! Another! This will give it to you, you eat dinner and that's it... And very rich! They are great! Look there! A calf without milk! Watch! Miracle, "milagrsimo"! Did you see? I know even with the bread making. If you give me a loaf of bread, I make 712 loaves appear and a baker. Depends on the day. Look there! Nothing, I always get. You can serve more, if you are in trouble. I like you because you're gay. I like the whole family. You, your father Joseph, hard worker, your mother Mary... Mary... Mary... Mary... To you I can tell you, your mother Mary I always liked it. When we were young, I was in love. Yes, I liked it. I was young and not ugly... And so... I liked. Nothing ever happened and nobody did you know, not even her. But a voice, one day I took a look, but... I could not more, dreamed of her, I wanted to see it, to hug her, hard. I wanted to talk about anything, type: "How old are you?" Perhaps a sentence but was never able. I loved, one day even decided to tell him. I came, I saw and I said: "I marry Joseph. " Exclaimed: "No!" And she: "Yes". You stay bad. I said: "Why are you home with Joseph?" He replied: "I must. Must... " and it stuck with me. Someone insisted, even at night: "You must marry Joseph. " I could not tell who was because it was someone very influential. People are not concerned with their affairs. But she found herself well. I was wrong, but eventually I get it. If your mother had married me, maybe you had not been born and a girl was born. But a child would not have changed the world. I'll tell you a story and then to the bed. It is the story of a father they had two sons, one was called Prodigal and the other... Forget it. Prodigal was a nervous type, always angry. One day he said: "I'm leaving". And the father: "Where?" And he: "Where I please" and began to argue. For any nonsense was nervous. One day he lost a sheep, but neither sought. When his father died, came home and said: "I want to see the will! The old man, the new! " They began to argue and angry. I never understood well why but at a certain point bought a meadow. Planted three olive it needed oil. And he began to throw rocks at all. He said: "I throw the first stone!" When I was not his friend Juliano Sin, threw stones. He said: "I am without sin and throw the first stone. ' He put a sheet in the eye and said: "Quitdmela, I see the straw!" He straws... Come on, this Prodigal was an idiot... Well, there was a big mess and finally there was light. They turned on the current, two left to jail and one knee Manco. His brother became a soldier and his mother was ill, Not know how much, Jesus! He called the servant, a certain Baptist and said, "Come here, John. " He threw water over head, had this hobby. Bathed them all saying: "I'm Baptist!" Made those jokes, threw water over his head. Yes, dear Jesus... - Benigno! - I've slept, but the child did. It has made us late. Sorry. Nothing, do not worry. - Thank you, God bless you. - Nothing. I'm going to bed, goodnight. - Good night, Mary. - Joseph, help me to take off the veil. Yes, Mary. Good night. Smarrita! Smarrita, come here! Sma... Angel! Angel! Angel! Why all the shouting? Do you think it is noon? I lost my angel, I've been running since this morning. - What? - My angel left me. - How? - I lost my angel. It is not possible, Angels never lost alone. - I've lost. - We are not allowed to miss. - Well, we got lost once. - Where? - On the way to see my mother to the field. - Ah yes, I remember, with the fog. - But if it was summer! - It was winter. - No, it was summer. Angel! Angel! Excuse me, have you seen an angel? Feathers, which will, but angels integers. Thank you. Angel! Angel! - Where are you going alone? - I lost my angel. Better! If all be lost, would not work. - Stay with us! - I loved it, but... - Luana, how did it go? - Goodbye. - No, wait. - Have you been paid? - Yes, but we had to change rooms. - In ours had an angel, only. - A single angel? - And who are you? - A friend... Where is this angel? - There. But who are you? - I'm... Whats there, where? - There. - Thanks. Where are you going? Come! Angel! Sorry, looking for my angel. Excuse me, do you also alone? - No, he's in the bathroom. - Ah, in the bathroom, I felt that... By chance, Have you seen an angel alone? Top? Thank you, good night. Hello, Angel! I! I was late because was no traffic. In summer people accumulates at the same time... Want me really, angel? I understand. Do not believe the things you say... You know I have changed wings from... What a race this far! I came home and you... Last night you left home without warning, but remember that you can not do. He joked. If you want to go, Young children are not... If you want to go, just tell me... We have a relationship of years we have always told you everything. If you want to go, let me know. But... I leave all phrases you say in these cases. If you go, my life is useless. I can not live alone. Without you I am finished, try again. Our relationship can be beautiful and constructive... fundamental to the life of both. Not worth losing all you have given us. Maybe you're right, sometimes I wrong, but try to change. And it is not understood! Now you tell me of once for all, you must be sincere. Want me forever? Yes. Speak, tell me something, I ran all night for you. I'm leaving for good. Hala, just one sentence to make a man feel better. Is it possible that...? Now shut up, right? Never understood, always ambiguous, even now. What does "I will forever"? What does "I'm leaving"? Never understand when you talk! Why did you leave me? Why should I stay you? The life of a gentleman is impeccable, but no one knows how heavy it is to live with the Master. The gentleman gets up every morning and it makes me sick thinking of you while you dress, while going to the bathroom every morning at the same time with the same comic. It seemed all so light, and now I know how many steps you from the bathroom to the bedroom. And I hate the way you walk, and say "then", and I hate when you turn light in my sleep, and when I'm wrong and you get irritated, and when you speak and when not talking to me. And when you turn on the TV three times a week to see... "Francis, the Talking Mule" and tell me: "How will you talk a mule?" A trick... Yes, a trick. And I hate when we lunch or dinner and for years have you been asking one filetito because... "I do not trust the restaurant. " A filetito! Do you know that there are oysters and Chinese restaurants? A filetito! Boring! By your side, an accountant seems James Dean. Do you know that in all these years I have never been surprised by anything? I've never raised eyebrows. Never. And does not take much to surprise, I do not know, that once pidieras in steak place, a "ossobuco" for me to say: "Oh, I'm crazy!" What's the difference if I go? What amazes me you fall in love with another? Ah, you have missed! You said "in love with another"! Have you been in love with another? I realized... I did not realize! Because trust you, and trust yet. Do not go. Who is? Tell me, do not do anything. - Total, I'll find the same. - It's Him Ah, okay? Is he in the sense...? Have you been in love with him? What has he that I have not? I thought you had more taste. And for me, how I'm... Each has the rival merits. To me it touched me. All the same! I knew you looked with him, but do not think it was something so erotic and serious. I never surprised, but he, yes. Satisfies you. Ah, right? Did not you have been surprised? All right. Now I will lift the eyebrows, I'll make a game. One thing that neither knows. - There is nothing to know He does not know. - Are you sure? Yes, I will do it as a gift. Let's play something. I'll kill myself. I go to the window, count to five... six... Count to nine and... - Huh? So you... - It's true, I do not know how to do. Yes, I tried, but can not kill. Do I do it? Do you love me or not? Well, better to be clear. Then I roll. I have not thrown... Not interested? Look I do really. I'm here. I kill. Do you love me or not? Angela! Oh, no... Again! Angela! - What is it? - Angela, come here. - What are you doing? - Angela, I dreamed... - Do you find the time? Was it a bad dream? - Very bad. I've slept five minutes. - Come to be friends. - Do you? - No, I do not! - Do not go. - Come on. - Mother, was tremendous! Cuckoo! Surprise! How we have fun tonight!

I know, you're right, shut up forever at home. I'd like to take a walk. If you organize a procession, a representation of the Annunciation... Never do anything in this town. And be careful, Angela! If you go to the window, you see. They realize, speak evil. If you realize that you're an angel really, just like King Kong. They put on display, make a circus, you fold down with planes. Humans are tremendous. He, he, you want to go with him! Hey! By the way, how is he? How is it? Angela, how is it? I saw him once. And I got to laugh, is so thin...

Easy, if you are nervous, is over. - A relaxing! - Calm down. - Yes - Thank you, Director. I wanted to establish myself in this small town... ...Capital. The first thing copy for a person who wants to settle and go physically, the most banal thing. Second thing first order geographic is to have in this city the house. The house: feminine singular. I found just yesterday, bright, "buy it" signed, 100 million. I am told that in this city you go to the bank and provide them. So I want a loan, but no... - Excuse me a moment. - Whew! Hello?

It is very simple, is all a warranty issue. Let me finish. Because there I want to look like a freeloader. I'm not one of those who you give the money back and no longer see.

I'll take the $ 100 million, which Will give them back!... when you can. A day passed, will give 5 million stays 95... So to finish. - You want a loan to buy the house. - Exactly. You may have the money invested. - How? - Those 100 million I could have spent somewhere. - 100 million in clothes? - Yes I do not... I do not know how you can enforce. Perhaps putting clothes also child, shorts, coats... But I do not get to 100 million. - But who has 100 million dresses? - Billions! If you and I had two thousand million, would have invested, right?

With all the money they have! Speaking of our tickets, But the outputs? Depends on which part you are going! Do you think cheating on me? Is this an input or an output? Do you get to ask what contest? What is the capital of France? Let's talk seriously! I put an example with the pen.

One billion... And you just take a pen with billions in his pocket and denies me Director! How far have we come? So unless I count a pen? Am I a compass? You should open a stationery! Instead of heart has an inkwell! Director! Freeze, Mr. Diosteayude! What to do to have 100 million steal? You have to kidnap! You have to steal, kill, fornication, or want the other woman!

I know. - How? - I know. - Really? - Yes - Who told you? - One I knew, but could not tell. - One day he escaped. - How? We were together at a restaurant. He looked outside and said: "How beautiful is the world! God created it!" And "Nice God think so... " So said. - Then who created God? Dime. - I can not tell. Why are you so ignorant me? What have I done? See how you are? What does it cost? Tell me at least the first letter. - All right, "B". - "B"... - Blond or brunette? - Moreno. - Moreno. Yes it is one... - Shut up! Do not tell me, I want to find out. Moreno with the "B"... - Italian? - Italian. - Is he alive? - He's alive. - How old? - 30-35. - Tell me the second letter. - "U". - "U"? "U". - "B" and "U". "Bu". "Bu", created God, 35 years alive. Who could it be? - Do you believe in God? - Yes - Why? - For small, to test said: "God, if you're there, within 10 seconds, it rains! " And in 10 seconds tremendous deluge fell. Fuck... Do it again, ask hail. - Try It. - I get a laugh, I have fear. - Adelante! - I can ask one thing? - Yes God, if you're there, in 10 seconds, snow! Seven, eight... and nine. It's nine. - Miracle! - What miracle? - Did not you say "in 10 seconds, nine?" - But why nine? Snow! - I said nine. - Nine? - Had understood nine. - Nine? When you ask for miracles, have to be precise. You can not be wrong. Perhaps God is not safe and think you said nine. What, when they asked miracles Jesus was put to articulate? "Jesus, give me the light!" And Jesus: "What, the list?" "No, the view! 'V' in Venice!" Imagine! Yes, you have to be precise, articulate! Go! And I said snow. Naples, Empoli, Venice, Empoli. Snow, God... Snow! - Tell me the last letter, come! - And then... Okay, the last and longer. "C". - "Buc"? - "Buc". "Buc"... Who will? - I know. - "Buc"... "Buc"...
