I think you're gonna like this three-bedroom property, Mr. Poole. Right through here, this bathroom has been completely redone... new tiles, new sink. There are walk-ins in every room. And right through here is the kitchen. Look at this skylight. That is nice. And the cabinets, I believe are original, which some people really enjoy. And if you follow me to the backyard... And, uh... What about the other house? The one down the street. Oh, right. Well, I made the offer like you asked, but they didn't want to sell. Yeah, that house is not on the market. I mean, did you tell them that I'd pay whatever they wanted? I did, Mr. Poole. They live there. They like it. That's their home. But anyway, back to this place... Let me just show you this backyard. Are you from California, Mr. Poole? The weather's so nice here. A lot of Californians spend time in their backyard. And look at this... there's plenty of room for a pool - or a hot tub... - How much? Well, they're asking 325. I'm sorry, could you mind repeating that? I just have trouble with this ear. Oh, I'm sorry. I was saying they're asking 325. Okay, I'll take it. Well. Mr. Poole, I'm pretty sure I could get them to knock off 25 or 30. I mean, look at this place. It needs to be re-stuccoed and... It's okay. I'll pay what they're asking. But look at the place. I mean, it needs paint at the minimum and the landscaping really leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to pay what they want. No negotiating, no repairs, just... But Mr. Poole... Mrs. Wyat, you need to just let this go. Okay? The higher the price, the bigger your commission. - So... - Okay, then.

I'm your neighbor from... from next door, Esperanza Martinez. I just want to come by and say hello, um, welcome you to the neighborhood. Hello. Homemade tamales for you. Oh. Thank you. I used to be... good friends with the man who lived here. I was actually the one who found him. Found him where? - There in your kitchen. - Oh. He died of a heart attack. Fue terrible. It was terrible. He had been laying there for 10 hours, they think. - Here? - Yes. We were good friends. So where are you from? Not here. Oh. Thank you for the tamales. You're welcome. Looks like you're burning. - I am. - Are you wearing any sunscreen? Well, I would have called before I stopped by, but you still don't have a phone. - No. - Yeah, and I rang the... Anyway, I just wanted to make sure you're doing okay and that the move went well. And did you notice that we re-stuccoed and painted? Yeah, I noticed that. Didn't I ask you not to do that? Yeah, well... - I just thought... - The thing is... I'm not gonna be living here that long, Mrs. Wyat, so it's really just a waste of time. What do you mean, you're not gonna be living here that long? And for the record, whoever did it, they did kind of a lousy job. It's all discolored right there. Oh, well... we can have that fixed. No, don't bother. It doesn't matter. - Oh. - Well. Anyhow. Mrs. Wyat's voice: Looks like you're burning. - I am. - Are you wearing any sunscreen? Well, I would have called before I stopped by, but you still don't have a phone. And I rang the bell. Well? And did you notice that we re-stuccoed and painted? Henry's voice: Yeah, I noticed that. Didn't I ask you not to do that? Yeah, well... - I just thought... - The thing is, I'm not gonna be living here that long, Mrs. Wyat. So it's kind of a waste of time. What do you mean, you're not gonna be living here that long? And for the record, whoever did it, they did kind of a lousy job. It's all discolored right there. Oh, well... we can have that fixed. No, don't bother. It doesn't matter. Anyhow. (button clicks) What are you doing? Oh my God. (water running) (faucet shuts off) Esperanza: Yes! Really. Really. Yes! Yes! (continues indistinctly) I don't know anything for sure, but... It's... it's like... Oh, please please please please. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. See you soon. Mr. Poole, something very wonderful has happened... Were you just in my backyard? Did you not look? Were you looking in the windows? Ay, no! Of course not. Did you not see? See what? - Oh. Oh my God. - I... l... I saw you. You were running around. Oh. Oh. Do you need to borrow something? Okay, I'll see you later. (door slides open) You don't see it? See what? All I see is a water stain from a lousy stucco job. You are not looking. L... I don't see anything. You are not looking. Es el rostro de Dios. The face of God. The face of Christ. It's... it's like a sign from God. Look, the only sign I see is that you seem a little overexcited. It's probably the heat. I think the heat has gotten to you. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. L... l... I know it's hard to believe it. But the proof is right... right there. All right. You just going to ignore it? No. No. I am gonna ignore you, though. (muttering) So who were you talking to? To you. No, I mean in your yard. You were on the phone. - Who were you talking to? - Mmm. Excuse me? - (doorbell rings) - (dog barking) Stay there. Yeah? Hi, I'm looking for Esperanza Martinez. Said she would be here. I'm Father Vincent Salizar from St. Ramos Catholic Church. She called and asked me to meet her here... Disculpame. Que bueno que llego. It's in the backyard. I'll show you. Ven. Come in, come in, come in. Mire. Pares aqui. Aqui aqui. Pares aqui. Aja. Look, I don't know what you're up to, but I didn't say you could come back here and I'd like you to both leave. You see? Well, I do see something. - Very sorry about the intrusion, Mr... - Poole. Henry Poole. Mr. Poole, I apologize. So... you do see it? Well, I can see how it could be interpreted as a face. - Oh my God. - That's quite clear. But the face of Christ? I'm not so sure that we can make that leap. Thank you. Thanks. You see? You understand? And like I was saying, I'd like you to both leave. I'm kinda busy in there. No no no no no. Look. Look. You can see... the eyes here and the beard here. And the holy shoulder. Everything. Everything, Padrecito. Everything. I can see how it could be that. These types of things should not be easily discounted, but we do have to take these things at face value, no pun intended. Look, the face value of this is that it's a water stain. Right? - Right? - You're probably right, Mr. Poole. Yeah. Yeah. And by no means does the church condone any kind of frivolous claims of this nature, but... But nothing. Look, the game's over, okay? That's not the face of Christ and I want to be left alone! You're right. You're right, Mr. Poole. We've imposed enough. Esperanza, let's go. No no, espere un minuto, si? Mr. Poole, you can't ignore this, please. - Es que espere, mejor... mejor, si. - Esperanza... - vamonos. - Por favor, espere un minuto. Mr. Poole, don't you believe in God? Please! Please. (whispering) Es que... es el rostro de Dios. Sus ojos. (Esperanza continues) Excuse me. No, wait... (pushes button) Father Salizar's voice: These types of things should not be easily discounted, but we do have to take these things at face value, no pun intended. Henry's voice: Yeah, well, I agree... (tape rewinding) Woman's voice: Please... (woman sobbing) It's gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (knocking) Woman: Hello? Hi. I'm Henry. I live next door. Oh, yeah. I saw you move in. I'm Dawn. - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Anyway, your daughter, I guess, she dropped this in my backyard. Oh, God, I'm... I'm so sorry. I keep telling her to stay out of other people's yards. No, it's not a problem. She was just walking around back there. Did she tape you? Um... I don't know. 'Cause she does that sometimes. She tapes people. Why does she do that? Uh... I don't know. Um, well, I've got to go. But thank you so much for bringing this back to Millie and... I'll make sure that she stays out of your yard. You having another party? Sorry? Well, I've seen you in here a couple of times buying the same stuff. I thought maybe... Uh... That'll be $155.82. I thought maybe you might be throwing some parties. No parties. Well, that doesn't look like a very healthy diet. Just kind of a phase. Andales. Andales. Hurry hurry. Go go go with me. Hurry, girl! Hurry. Hurry, Margie. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. - Hey! - Oh my God, oh my God. Run run run run! (Esperanza shouting) I see you. Hey! Hey! Holy shoulder! Hey. Are these yours? There you go. You can have those back. Let me ask you a question. Does that look like a church back there? 'Cause it's not. It's my house. It's private property. And I don't want you four wandering around back there when I'm not home with a bunch of candles doing whatever it is that those things do. Okay? And you're gonna put paint on my wall? All right? That's vandalism. - Got it? - Please. Please, Mr. Poole. Calm. We didn't paint anything on your wall. - Really? - Really. - No, nothing? - No no no... Okay, so what's that? Wanna tell me what that is? Oh my God. That's not paint, Mr. Poole. And we did not put it there. So what is it? It's blood. - Oh... - It's the holy blood. - Blood? - Yes. Okay. - Oh my God. - Let me tell you something. All three of you are old enough to know better and I'm especially disappointed in you. Sick of it. Please just leave me alone, all right? Blood. (rock music playing) # Whoo hoo # # Whoo hoo # # Whoo hoo # # Whoo hoo # # I got my head checked # # By a jumbo jet # # It wasn't easy # # But nothing is # # No # # Whoo hoo # # When I feel heavy metal # # Whoo hoo # # And I'm pins and I'm needles # # Whoo hoo # # Well, I lie and I'm easy # # All of the time but I'm never sure # # When I need you # # Pleased to meet you # # Oh, yeah. # Thank you. (humming) Ooh! Oops. - "Oops?" - Sorry. Oh, I missed. You... you missed? Eh, let me just try again. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Damn it. Jesus. Sorry. - Oh, damn. - Eh! - (sighs) - You know, seriously, do you want to go practice and come back? Maybe warm up on, like, an orange? What's the story? You know, at this point, I'm just like, "A razor blade and a coffee cup, I'll do it myself." You know what I mean? One more time. It's just... this is the one. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Okay, just relax. Okay? I feel it. Okay. - Ah, got it. - Got it? - Mm-hmm. - Good. Ouch! How many times did she hit you? Uh, three or four. I actually kinda lost track. Three or four, huh? She's getting better. She got some practice. Let me just run through a couple of standard Q and A. - You sleeping okay? - I could use a little more, yeah. Diet good? I eat, yeah. Exercise? Uh, you know, here and there. So no? - Well... - Other than that, Mr. Poole, you're doing fine. I'd probably try a little more exercise. Maybe some yoga? Or Pilates? I'll call you in a few days when your blood and urine come back. I can help you over here. Hope you're not using that as a mixer. - Huh? - 'Cause you're not getting vodka. Oh, yeah. Did you know that in 1985, Gorbachev, right after he became the party's general secretary, tried to eradicate vodka in Russia? The people wouldn't have it, though. Isn't that weird? I mean... something like 30,000 Russians die a year from alcohol poisoning, but the people, they want what they want. Yeah. What's wrong with you? Hmm? Well, I don't mean to be rude. It's just that... something is clearly wrong with you. I don't know if you're sad or angry or both, but you're not normal. I thought maybe you might want to talk about it. You want me to tell you why I'm sad and angry while you're ringing up my bottles of bleach? So it is both... sad and angry. - I didn't say that. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. I was indulging you. Okay? I was being polite. Okay, indulge me some more. - Tell me what's wrong. - Why don't you just ring my stuff up, all right? Jesus. I mean, I appreciate your concern, but I'd just like to get out of here. - All right? - Okay. I'm sorry I asked. Don't be. It's okay to be sad, you know. I mean, I've been really sad before. Sometimes... you have to be sad to remind yourself that you're alive. Better than feeling nothing, right? It's not coming off, huh? No. No, it isn't. I, uh, think I might have even made it worse. You, uh, you got any suggestions? Um, no. But if it's what Esperanza says it is, then I guess it's gonna take a little bit more than a bottle of bleach. Yeah, well, Esperanza's wrong. So you aren't in so much doubt. You really think that's the face of Christ? Actually, from this angle, it looks a little bit like you. I mean, an abstract version. I guess. It's just a stain. It's a bad stain. Well, if you can't get it off, I guess it'll be something to remember you by. What? Well, you're not gonna live here that long, right? Esperanza, she's like the local newspaper around here. I think she cornered the real estate agent and so we got the lowdown on you. Oh. Yeah. So... so what are you doing? Buying it, selling it and making a profit? Yeah. Yeah, something like that. Well, don't sell it to any weirdoes, okay? No. I won't. Okay, well, good luck with the face. Thanks. Or whatever it is. (radio on low volume) Woman: Listen to me. The man is clearly an atheist. And he's not very nice. The two go hand in hand. Well, those without faith sometimes need a little help. That's it. Psst, psst. Now what are you doing? - Your lawn is so sloopy. - Sloopy? - Yeah. - Look, this is ridiculous. Okay, people just don't go around helping one another for no reason, so just tell me what it is you're doing. - What do you want? - I don't want anything. Just tell him. Just ask him. Ask me what? She wants to bring the church in to test the face in your backyard, to see if it's a miracle. You've got to be kidding me. Nope. She's crafty like that. - Aren't you? - Yeah. I didn't catch your name, but anyways... Listen to me, okay? You can build me a goddamn gazebo back there and I still wouldn't let you and your crazy church friends into my house. All right? So that face, whatever you happen to think it is, is a stain. It's not a miracle. Okay? How can you say that? Look, I really don't want to talk about it, so I just came out here to give you that. I just found it, so... (sobbing) Oh my God. Why did you have to go and do that? Um, why are you crying? I just... I'm sorry. I just found that. That's Leo. He was her boyfriend before he died. He lived in your house. He was such a good man. Well, look, there's a cigar box full of them under the sink, so you can come by and get 'em when you want 'em. He was so handsome. L... I never thought I'd find someone like him. L... I was ready to... to just be old alone. I never married. Never found anyone. Then one day, three years ago or so, Leo came here. And that was it. Years of being alone and one minute... manages to take it all away. A lifetime of sadness and... suddenly I couldn't even remember what it was like to be sad. And then he died. And I remember. And... I pray to God to help me stop feeling that pain and let me know that he was okay. And now... the face appears... the face of God. Look, Esperanza... I want you to be very honest with me. Okay? You really think that that stain out there is the answer to all your prayers? Do you? So what exactly is it that you want the church to do? Just come and test the wall. Test the blood. And to see what it is. And if it's nothing, then it's nothing and I won't bother you again. I promise, really. Um... All right. Just one day. That's it. I mean it. One day. Thank you, Mr. Poole. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. You'll see. You'll see. Everything happens for a reason. Esperanza, llevelo al dentro. - Gracias. - Who's that guy? He has to open up the wall and look at what's behind the stain to be sure it's not man-made. We'll repair it. It'll look as good as new. Don't worry. No, don't repair it. It's okay. Don't be silly, Mr. Poole. We're not gonna leave a hole in the wall. Doesn't matter. I'm not gonna be here that long. You know, Father Salizar, the house was re-stuccoed before I moved in, so that's it. There's really not a lot to talk about. Maybe not about the house. Why did you say you were not gonna be here that long? I don't really want to talk about it. Oh, yeah, you do. Oh, I do? Otherwise you wouldn't have mentioned it. Let me ask you a question. What makes you think you know me that well? I don't think that. I just think anybody with two eyes could see that something is wrong, - like you're... - Sad and angry? Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. I'm a good listener. Yeah? Me too. Father Salizar's voice: I just think anybody with two eyes could see that something is wrong. - Like you're... - Sad and angry? Yeah. Something like that. I just think anybody with two eyes could see that something is wrong, - like you're... - Sad and angry? Yeah. Something like that. (recorder button clicks) What are you doing in there? Wow. You really like this place. You don't talk, do you, Millie? It's okay. Sometimes I don't like to talk either. You know? I ought to go. Okay? I'd love to sit here and visit with you, but I just can't. I got a pretty long journey ahead of me. I wish I could stay and talk with you. I just don't have the time. Mr. Poole? Uh... l... I'm sorry. I rang the bell, but... Well, I have something for you. How'd you know this was the one? I know everything about this neighborhood. You should know that by now. This used to be my room. Mr. Poole, are you okay? This used to be my room. This is the last place I remember being happy. Even then I can barely remember. This is the room where they used to scream at each other. Mmm. It's a strange thing about standing here again. It's doing absolutely nothing for me, you know? Mr. Poole, I'm sorry it wasn't what you hoped. Don't be. It never is. But thank you. This was very generous. - Mmm. - Thanks. What did you expect? You can't go to the past to fix the present. You sound like a fortune cookie. (laughs) Cookies don't talk. Now... at least now you know. Know what? To come back to the place you grew up. Yeah. Now I know. It's like nothing. You find out there's nowhere to hide. # Shadows are falling # # And I been here all day # # It's too hot to sleep # # And time is running away # # I feel like my soul has # # Turned into steel # # I've still got the scars # # That the sun didn't heal # # There's not even room enough # # To be anywhere # # It's not dark yet # # But it's gettin' there. # Millie? Hey. Come out, honey. It's too late to be playing games. Where are you, Millie? Where are you, Millie? Millie? Millie? Millie? What are you doing? Honey? Hey, Millie. Millie. Hey. What is it? Hey, what did you say? What? - (whispering) - Hey. What did you say? Mama. Mommy? Can you hear me? We're okay. I love you so so much. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm sorry. Mommy's here. Mommy's right here. Come on. Let's go. Hey, let's go home. Thanks. What happened out there? You tell me. She hasn't said a word in over a year, ever since her father left. I mean, she loved him so much. And it's just been... so unfair for her. I mean, l... I couldn't even get her out of bed when this whole thing started. She just kind of turned inside herself and couldn't find her way out. I took to every kind of doctor... therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and pretty much everyone... nothing. They'd just run down the list... depression, post-traumatic whatever... abandonment. And after a while, she got a little better, but she just wouldn't talk. Maybe she just didn't have anything to say. Maybe she wasn't ready until now. Maybe. But she touched that wall and she... You think she spoke because she touched the wall? No, I'm not saying that, but that's what happened. I mean, she touched it and she talked. And I'm just praying that it stays that way. Dawn, I think it's great that Millie spoke. But I think you should realize it was a completely random event. Things just... they don't happen like that in real life. I mean, if they did, then I wouldn't... You wouldn't what? Ever feel like things just happen for no reason? That you're just kind of going along for the ride and there's just nothing you can do? I need to tell you something. What? I want to tell you so that I'm not the only one that knows. Henry, this is so unheard of here in the States. I mean, it happens. - But this disease... - Disease? It steamrolls through the system. Stopping it at this point... You're saying I'm gonna die. Yes. (birds chirping) (knock on door) Mr. Poole. Mr. Poole, are you okay? Mr. Poole? Sorry. The door was open. That doesn't mean you can just walk through it. I need to talk to you. No. No, you don't, actually, 'cause I know exactly what you're gonna say. No, you don't exactly. So I guess you heard what happened last night. Now you think that little girl spoke because she touched the wall? And now we're all supposed to believe that the Second Coming's happening in my backyard. And the next thing you know, this whole goddamn street... sorry... turns into a carnival with every holy-roller freak within a 100-mile radius lined up around the block to touch or catch a glimpse of my stucco job. (chuckles) Well, it's not gonna happen. And in no way did Millie finally speaking have anything to do with her touching the wall, and you know that. And God only knows... and I use the phrase very loosely, believe me... who knows what it was that caused her to get up at 3:00 in the morning and wander over here and start palming the wall like her life depended on it? - It was me. - What was you? I told her the wall would take away her suffering if... if she just had faith. Why would you do that? - It worked, no? - No. She worked. Maybe your insane pep talk got to her, but she got here on her own. Why it's so hard for you to believe that something like this could happen? Why is it so important to you that I believe that something like that could happen? - Because it... - Because I'll tell you. Because if you can convince me, then suddenly your beliefs become more real. Right? The more people you can get to jump on your God's-on-the-wall train, the more your mission's made. So until you get me to swallow your world and believe what you believe, you'll never have the kind of faith you want to have. You'll always have a little bit of doubt. You'll... you'll never know if you're quite right. You'll always kind of be wondering if it's real. You'll always be sitting over there waiting for that man to come waltzing back in from the dead. And that's sad. That's really sad. I'm just trying to help. Just like that. Yeah? Esp... Esperanza? - Hey. - Hey. How you doin'? I'm good. Just getting some air. I just wanted to thank you for helping me with Millie last night. So... I made you some cookies. Thank you. It was Millie's idea. - How is she doing? - She's really good. I'm just praying that it stays that way. You wanna go for a walk? Yeah. Mmm, just came out of the oven, like, 10 minutes ago. # Her fingers touch upon my lips # # It's a morning yearning # # It's a morning yearning # # Pull the curtains shut # # And try to keep it dark # # But the sun is burning # # The sun is burning # # Baby crying kept us up all night # # With her morning yearning # # With her morning yearning # # Morning yearning... # I just wish I could tell you that everything was gonna be all right.

Dear God. (sobbing) Oh my God. Patience. What are you doing? What's going on? Are you... are you okay? Yeah. - What's wrong? - Nothing is wrong. Everything is right. What are you talking about? I touched the face. I just put my hand on it. And my whole body got all warm. And then I closed my eyes. I saw light everywhere. I opened them... and I could see. (crying) I can see. Look at that. I can see perfectly. The house numbers, the license plate. You know, this is amazing. - This is a miracle... - Don't say that. What? Miracle? - Yeah. - Come on, Mr. Poole, what else could this be? What? A coincidence? I mean, there are no miracles, Patience. I don't believe in them. Imagine that there was something wrong with you, Mr. Poole. And you did this seemingly meaningless thing, put your hand on a wall, and you were healed. It's okay, Mr. Poole. You don't have to say anything. I gotta go. I gotta go tell my mom. (laughs) This is incredible! Wow! Hi. Hey. It's getting harder, isn't it? What's that? To pretend this isn't happening. (woman vocalizing) (doorbell rings) Hey! - Hi. - You're home. - Yeah. - Um... Millie wants to know if you want to come over and play. Really? Um, I just don't think I'm up to it. - Henry... - I think I'll just stay here. ...are you actually considering saying no to a six-year-old girl with actual words coming out of her little mouth? Give me a minute. We'll be in the yard. Millie? Dawn? I got you, Mr. Poole. Let's get him! (both laughing) - Get him, Mommy, get him! - I got him! Ahhh! (Millie laughing) Oh, gosh. I surrender.

I surrender. # A million tears # # A million codes # # 1:15 # # No way to go # # You point your finger # # To the moon # # It looks like rain # # Coming soon # # I figured all # # My worst fears # # Believe in childlike heroes # # But I don't want to go # # That way # # Surrender hope # # Again # # I don't want to go that way # # Surrender hope # # And faith # # Again # # Your blood, your fire # # Your kiss good night # # Your words, sometime # # They might be mine # # I feel this love could cross the sand # # I want to feel that way # # The fire might linger and fade away # # The shadows run from yesterday # # Like everyone # # And everything were memories # # And then appears # # Your blood, your fire # # Your kiss good night # # Your words, sometimes # # They might be mine # # I feel this love could cross the sand # # I want to feel that way # # Oh, don't make me feel that way # # Oh, I want to feel # # That way # # Oh, I'm breaking through # # These walls of steel # # Pushing that wall for something real # # I'm falling far and faster still # # Wake up, wake up # # Wake up, wake up # # Wake up, wake up # # Everyone and everything # # Everyone and everything. # (birds chirping) - Dawn: All right? - Millie: Yeah. You ready? - Okay, good. - Hey! Hey. Hi, Mr. Poole. Hey, there, Millie. That's a really nice dress. You look really pretty. You look nervous, Mr. Poole. - Oh, no, I'm... I'm fine. - (Dawn laughs) I, uh, no. I'm just a little tired, that's all. You kind of wore me out yesterday. Um, honey, do you want to get in the car? I wanted to, uh, return your dish to you. Oh, thanks. They were really good. Thanks a lot. Glad you liked them. Really shouldn't eat so many at once, though. - Not good for you. - No, it doesn't matter. I mean, I'm... Uh... no, you're right. I shouldn't. Well, listen, l... I was wondering and, I don't know, it might seem a little unfair seeing as how you know my situation, but I thought that maybe, if you were able to get a sitter and you had the time... - Yes. - Really? Oh. Oh, wait. - What? - Can I ask you? Well, you did just ask me, didn't you? No, I mean, really ask you... to finish asking you. Okay. Would you like to get dinner with me? I can't. I'm busy. - I didn't really want to any... - No! Henry, I'm kidding. I would love to. - Great. - What about tomorrow? It's perfect. And it's not unfair for you to ask. Would it be worse if you didn't? Thank you. Okay, so... - Tomorrow. - Yeah. Have fun. Just this once, okay? Okay, I promise. Whatever you say, Mr. Poole. Thank you. What's wrong with her? Bursitis. And what about the one next to her? There's nothing wrong with her. So, preventative? Just in case. No, is it true that the man in the red shirt just wants to be a better dancer? (laughs) Ay, Mr. Poole... (mutters in Spanish) Um, what about you, Mr. Poole? Have you touched the wall yet? No. But you will. Hey, Henry. - Hi. - It's good to see you. Funny. It's good to see you too. Oh, you... you forgot these. I wanted to return those to you. Thanks. Don't really need them, though. - Well. - I guess they'll be a good souvenir - of my previous life. - Yeah. So have you talked to your doctor yet, - your eye doctor? - Not yet. tell me I'm 20/20. - Yeah. - I already know that. But, I mean, you got to think about all the write-ups in the medical journals. Right? You're still having a pretty hard time buying into this, - aren't you? - You gotta admit that it's... Do you know who Noam Chomsky is? - The writer? - Yeah. He's a linguist too, but... once in an interview, he said, "When questions of decision, reason or choice of action arise, human science is at a loss." You actually believe that? He meant that not everything needs an explanation. Sometimes things just happen because we choose for them to. I chose to believe. Okay. Thanks. You're welcome. Well, this is about the loveliest thing that I've ever seen. I can't wait to see what's for dinner. Pizza! (giggles) Perfect. This is... this is very romantic, Henry. - Thanks. - Really. Plastic utensils. Oh, yeah, family heirlooms. (chuckles) Can I ask you something? Sure. The other night, you came home kinda late and... You know what? It doesn't matter. It's fine. You want to know where I was. Yes. I can't tell you. (laughs) No, l... I'd just gone for a walk. And it's kind of funny 'cause I'd just left the house and started walking and l... I don't even think I really knew where I was going till I got there. Where did you go? The river. I, uh... My parents, they used to fight a lot. So I would go down there and even though it was such a big place, I always... I always just kind of felt very safe there. I'd kind of go there and hide. And that's why... I came here. So just like that, you disappeared. Since this thing happened to me, every morning when I wake up, the first thing I think about is... I mean, after I figure out if I'm still actually here or not... The first thing I think about is how much time that I have left. And all I can really do is kind of... wait for the end. But this morning when I woke up... the first thing I thought about was you. And Millie. I'm just trying to say that... that I'm enjoying this. I'm enjoying you and being around you. And I just... it's a surprise 'cause I didn't ever think that I'd feel this way. Millie: Mommy? Millie, what are you doing up? I can't sleep. Where is Esperanza? On the couch, snoring. Okay, let's go inside. Um, do me a favor. Keep enjoying this. All right, honey. Come on. Big sack of potatoes, huh? What are you doing up so late, Millie? It's a school night. Okay, you want Jasper? Here he is. 'Night. Sorry about that. It's like she doesn't want to miss a thing now that... You know... l... I think maybe we should just call it a night because this isn't... Henry. Sorry, this just isn't right. What are you talking about? Just you, me and everything all at once. I just... I'm sorry. Hey, how can you say that? Henry. I know you're gonna die, but all that either of us have is right now, and we should pay attention to that. I am paying attention. That's the problem. I'm sorry. # On an ocean white # # Of roaring waves # # I see your light # # And golden face # # A precious gift # # Of your longing arms # # Hurt me not # # Just sing to me, my love # # Ooh ooh # (crying) # How come so # # So # # Sweetly, child, you sing? # # And all the joy # # You bring to me # # Goes # # Goes our loved ones home # # And I will... # # I will be waiting. # Dawn: Henry! What's going on? - It's Millie. - What is it? She's in here. I mean, she's been like this all morning. She won't talk to me. She won't look at me. Nothing. Millie? Can you hear me? Millie, you remember how much fun we had the other day when we played? You remember that? Please. Please say something. Henry's here. He came over to play. Sweetie? Honey, can you hear me? Dawn's voice: Henry, I know you're gonna die, but all that either of us have is right now. And we should pay attention to that. Was there any kind of trauma? Anything which could have set her back like this? You told me "one time." You promised me. Mr. Poole, God is bigger than a promise. Just let me talk to you, yes? - Esperanza, please, let him go. - No no no! - Mr. Poole, just let us... - Listen to me, please. Listen to me! Mr. Poole. - Holy shit. - No no no no. No "holy shit." No "holy shit." Holy... something else. Mr. Poole, the test came back. Yeah, and what? And what? There's no explanation for it, right? - No. - It's a big surprise, huh? - No no, please... - Yes, you're right. There is no explanation. That's exactly right. You want to tell me what's going on? Why all these people are here? Huh? There here to see something unexplainable. - Yeah? - They're here to find some hope. Let me tell you something... I never should have let you come here in the first place 'cause this is insane. You got people praying to the wall. - Excuse me, is this your house? - Yeah! - This is my house. - You know, you're a very lucky man - to have such a... - Yeah! Yeah, I'm so lucky I ought to buy a lottery ticket, shouldn't I? You're all just kind of staring at the wall? Is that what you're doing? Hope can't save you. You understand that? It can't save you. Or her or her or him! You understand that? Hope isn't gonna save you! You know that. Esperanza: Please, Mr. Poole. No no no no no no, please. Listen to me! Listen, it's a miracle. It will do things... No no no no... this is a gift from God! This is a gift from God! No no... oh my God. I want this out of here! I don't want this stain on my wall! I want... This doesn't save lives. (woman vocalizing) Please. This doesn't save lives. # Oooh # # Sweetly, child, you sing # # And all the joy # # You bring to me # # Goes # # Goes our loved ones home # # And I will... # # I will be waiting # # On an ocean # # Sweetly, child, you sing # # On an ocean... # Esperanza: Mr. Poole? # On an ocean... # Can you hear me? Mr. Poole, the blood was real. # Ahhhhhhh # # Sahhh ahhh ahhh # # Sahhh ahhh ahhh. # (grunts) Oh, God. Thank God you're okay. What are you doing here? I've been waiting for you to wake up to make sure you're okay. (whispering) ...Dios mio. What are you smiling at? At you. Why did you not tell me, Mr. Poole? Tell you what? About your secret you had. Dawn explained it to me. What do you mean, "had"? I need to see a doctor! - (panting) - You need to get back in your room. - I need to see a doctor. - Sir! Mr. Poole, no no no. You should not be walking around. You need to get back to your room... hey hey! Hey hey! Mr. Poole. Please... okay. Mr. Poole, just calm down. - Mr. Poole... - (Henry muttering) No no no no. No no... don't do that. Mr. Poole, look at your arm, Mr. Poole. - You're bleeding. - Esperanza: Mr. Poole. Henry's voice: Please. Please. Millie: Mr. Poole. Wake up. Mr. Poole? Wake up. It's okay. Wake up. Millie, did you just say something to me? Mommy said you're not sick anymore. I'm... I'm not gonna die? No, Henry. You're not. How can that be? Well, I told them what was wrong with you and they checked. And you're fine. You were never sick, Henry. So... so I was never gonna die? Esperanza: No no, we are all going to die, just not right now. And that is the miracle for you. Um... after what I've done, the miracle's gone. No no no. Don't worry about that. It was here for as long as it needed to be here. - Yeah? - Yeah. Like everything and everyone. I'm glad you're better, Mr. Poole. Millie, I'm glad you're better too. You know, you should really get some rest. Okay? We'll be outside if you need us. Come on, honey. # I promise you will get old # # I promised you everything # # To protect you wherever you go # # I'll give you this diamond ring # # Just promise you will remember # # The promise should last forever # # Right up to the dying embers # # Of the fire that burns so slow... # - You're back. - Yep. I'm home. What's left of it. What do you make of all this? You're gonna live, Henry. Yeah. It's a gift. Yeah. Pretty miraculous, huh? I don't... I don't know what it is. I don't know if it was a mistake. I don't know. I don't think that any of this was a mistake. What now? # It's a beautiful thing to do # # Sometimes you just have to walk away # # Remember I do love you # # Have courage in what you say # # And promise you will remember # # That promises last forever # # Still after the dying embers # # The fire that burns so slowly # # Sometimes you just have to walk away # # Sometimes you just have to walk away # # Wishing today was yesterday # # Yes, sometimes you just have to walk away. # (instrumental music playing)
