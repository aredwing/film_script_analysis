I want waffles, spaghetti! Spaghetti waffles! Whoo. Whoo! Victor. Victor. Please wait in the house, please. My body is entering hunger shock. Oh, bad news. The cat pooped in the den. Worse news, I used your blanket to clean it up. - We don't have a cat. - No kidding. Oh. L... Sorry. I didn't think you'd be awake. You have an appointment... ...with Guy Morgan, I didn't think you'd wanna be late. Oh, look at you thinking. Cute. But I always have time for my portrait. Look alive. Paint. I'm feeling spiritually blocked. Draw me a sesame seed bath. Bath. Now. Now, make momma look more beautiful and thinner. And make that water more quiet. - Bev, you awake? - Of course I'm awake. If I waited for you, I'd never be on time. Lucky you never wait for me then. Victor, no. Uh, don't you want a glass? Hmm. Earthy. A tad fishy. Lovely gravel finish. Did you let Victor put worms in the blender again? Yes. I mean, no. I mean, it just happened. You know nothing can kill me. Nothing. Step on it, Katie. I cannot be late for this meeting. Just run them over if you have to. Hello? No, the kids don't need a library. I am the dean, and the dean gets what she wants, and I wanna remodel. You're just boring. I'm being honest. I don't know what else to tell you. And I wanted my office done for my meeting with Guy Morgan... ...the music mogul, but no. And using Bollywood as a theme for the dance? That's totally un-American. I don't care if it was my idea. Hello. Oh. Oh. I'm Dean Van Ravensway, and you must be... - Guy Morgan. - Ah, yes. Guy Morgan, a pleasure. You look like a man who knows things. Aha, even some things I shouldn't know. - And I'm Luke. Great. So tell me, Guy, is it true? Are you the new judge on Idol? Well, let's just say that Randy may be in the doghouse. - Now, let's talk about my son. - Of course. - Have you reviewed your schedule, Luke? - Yes, I have. In fact, um, I'd like to add a music class. Um, the music theory... Wellesley has a great business program. That's why we're here. There are two types of people in the music biz: Artists and businessmen. - Luke is a businessman. - Of course. Katie, get in here. Look alive. Make yourself useful. Luke is gonna need a tour of the campus. So text Bev and ask her to escort Mr. Morgan around campus. Now, Luke, if you are half as talented a producer as your father... The verdict's still out. He hasn't earned it. Heard the story of how I started in the music business? - Yes, everybody's heard it, Dad. - Then everybody should know how it goes. There I was, working for The Rolling Stones... ...when Mick himself... - Dad. Fine. As I said, the verdict is still out on my son. He just produced an album with the Fruity Dangers? Do you mean Danger Fruit? That record was amazing. I forgot what they were called because they made me absolutely no money. Thank you. Rare I meet anyone who's heard their album. What, are you kidding? They're a cult phenomenon. I'm sorry. Why are you talking? What I need is for Luke to learn to spot a commercially viable star. Image drives the bottom line, right? I feel you. Would we have Bieber Fever if he were an ugly troll? Actually, he is a tad hobbit-like, isn't he? I'd like Luke to produce your Semester Showcase... ...to see if he can identify sellable talent. - I produce the Semester Showcase. I will double your Showcase budget. I will invite every talent scout I know. This could be the beginning of a relationship... ...between Wellesley and Kensington Records. Looks like we have a new producer. Oh, and this is my daughter, Bev. Bev, this is the platinum-selling, Grammy-winning... ...and very handsome producer, Guy Morgan. Could you give his son, Luke, a tour? Sure. Would you like to see the Wellesley perks? Um, yes, brilliant. Sure. - Katie. I love your accent. Katie. Wanna come over tonight? What are you still doing here? Go. Guy and I have things we need to discuss. Out. Now. So, Guy, you've gotta tell me, what was that like working under Mick? Watch out. - Dangerous balls. - Ha, ha. Thanks. - So you womanned up and did it? Hey! - Oh, I did it. Hey! - What happened? Can we have our ball? I didn't give my CD to Luke. I snuck it in his dad's bag. But Guy Morgan has your demo. That's huge. What you need is a champion. No, what I need is to graduate. You giving our ball back or what? Oh, do you want this? She shoots, she scores. Unlike you, soccer boy. Oh, so spill it. Is Luke Morgan as hot as everyone Tweets he is? Hotter. You should ask him to the dance. Because I'm so forward with guys. First time for everything, right? - Hi, Luke. - Hello. You have to hear my demo. It's a retro-funk-jazz explosion. Back off. I was here first. Hold on, hold up. Please hold on. My boy does not want your demos yet. Walk away. Move along. Bye. It was nice chatting or whatever that was. - Yes, hi, I'm, uh... - Luke Morgan, right? Who is producing the Showcase. I don't think I'm gonna do the Showcase, so I need to keep a low profile... Yeah, yeah. Listen close now. There's two kinds of people in this school. There are the wannabes and there's gonnabes. You and I, we're gonnabes. What do we do? We stay away from the wannabes, all right? And girls named Yolanda. There are three of them and they are certifiably... Crazy? You attract crazy women? Shocking. It may seem like I don't have game, but ladies love a listener. Plus, I'm telling you, let me help you find acts. - Ah, so you're a talent scout? - Well, bottom line, I'm a DJ. - Oh, you're a DJ as well? - Check this. Whoa. Okay, yes. You could be very useful. It was nice meeting you. You got a girl for the dance? Because I can hook you up. Uh, no. Thanks. Uh, but what do you know about Bev Van Ravensway? - Supposed to see her tonight. - Bev? - Yeah. - She's hot... ...but the girl is mad, mad drama, okay? I am talking to you and you don't even know my name. - I'm Mickey O'Malley. - Mickey O'Malley. A rarity in the Irish community. Om. RAVl: Om. - Om. - Om. - Om! This is not a contest, Ms. Gail. Just concentrate on your breathing. My butt is numb. If your butt is suffering, then you are suffering. In fact, your entire life is suffering. Why? Because you crave that which is meaningless. Are you calling me shallow? No, I'm saying to stop your craving and release your butt. Just release it. Release it, yeah. Release that butt. Release that butt Oh, yeah, release that butt Oh, yeah, release that butt Mrs. Van Ravensway? What part of "if you interrupt my meditation... ...I will jerk your tail in a knot" do you not understand? You told me to tell you when dinner was ready. Oh, thank God. I'm craving some bourbon. Victor. - Oh. Um, dinner's ready. - Tell me something I don't know. Do you have any idea how stressful it is to run this academy? Yes, I spent the money at the spa. Five thousand dollars a night is not very expensive... ... when you think about the alternative, which is me having a nervous breakdown. Ow. What are you doing? I'm on the phone. - I'm cleansing. Heh, heh. Mac and cheese. I don't need your spiritual counseling. I'm thinking of firing you. Pace yourself, Ms. Gail, or you will not be one with everything. Honey, that's what I got you for. Now, make me one with everything. This Showcase is giving me the vapors. How did this become my life? Did I ever tell you all about the time I nearly got my big break? Yes. - Good. Then you all know how it goes. I ain't gonna leap, I'm gonna jump Find my way right out of this dump - I had talent, and they made me... A laughingstock. Now look at me. I got two ungrateful kids... ...a dwarfish, hairy, elfin servant... ...and a random tablecloth-wearing Asian... - Indian. - Who makes no sense at all, ever. Why don't you have another drink, Mom. Katie, napkin me. I have got to impress Guy Morgan... ...so I can stop pretending to care about this insufferable school... ...and we can all move to Hollywood where no one pretends to care about anything. Mom, I think that you're forgetting about the most important thing. Me. Guy will give me a deal as soon as he hears me sing. - I doubt that. - No, I've been practicing really hard. My voice teacher says I've transcended to a whole new level. Yeah, I doubt it. When my first single drops, I'll buy you that mansion... ...in the Hollywood Hills... ...and you can finally afford to have your legs lengthened. - Oh, ba... - Ms. Gail. - Miss Bev has clarity. Katie. - You see... - Look. - The lowly peasant tills the soil for 40 years without any rain. But the unemployed salesman who has recently discovered hydroponics... ...all of a sudden gets disgusted by the... - And see? No sense. - That didn't make any sense. - Let me finish. You... Oh, I doubt it. You have me pray all day. - I don't feel nothing. - You don't have a soul. No, you don't have soul. - I have a many souls. I'll give you one. - Where's your third eye? Turn that thing on. - I have a fourth eye too. You wanna see it? - What? - Shh. I wanna be 6'4". Wow me, Bev. Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do Just stop. Stop the wowing, okay? What's wrong? - Somehow you've gotten worse. I don't know how that was possible... ...but there isn't enough Auto-Tune that's gonna fix you. - Well, Katie's bad playing threw me off. - I don't think it was that. Again. Really? Okay. Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do Ouch. I could belch the song better. Have you been drinking the floor wax again? Anything to forget I live here. Ugh. My head is buzzing like a skeeter on a septic tank. - Ravi, meditate me. Good luck, buddy. Well, it doesn't matter, because I have my own plan. Does it make me a bad person that I kind of enjoyed that? No. Hmm. Nice work. - Guess who's on his way over. - Not now, Victor, I'm busy. Guess or prepare to get creamed. Victor! Victor! Victor, stop! I've got rings on my fingers And glitter in my hair I've got a one-way ticket And I just got here I'm gonna run... - Ha-ha-ha. - Victor, what are you doing? Victor! Victor, where did you put my clothes? - Surprise! - What? No. I'm gonna kill you. Victor! Oh, hi, Katie. You are evil. Let me in. I control every lock on this property. Crap. This is insane. Yeah, try the shed, it's unlocked, idiot. You gotta be kidding me. Crap. How did such an untalented daughter spring from my loins? Focus, Ms. Gail. We are making an offering to your personal deity. Tell him to give me fame and fortune. Not exactly how it works. Now, breathe through your Mula Bandha. Oh, honey, if I could do that, I'd get a million hits on YouTube. How much longer is this gonna take? Ugh. The prayer or the fame and fortune? Ha, ha. See you later. Victor. Katie? - Luke. - Katie. - Are you wearing a doormat? - Yes. - Welcome. - Why, thank you. The truth. Um... My stepbrother locked me outside of the house. Naked. Oh, sorry. You should... You should take my jacket. Oh. - Oh, no, no. There. - Thanks. Now the pants. - Hmm? I'm kidding. - You got me. - Ha, ha. No, no. One more parent-teacher conference, I swear I'm gonna lose it. Look at me. I'm an educator. I have no real skills. And I will die before I go back to my daddy's farm. You tell my personal deity to help me achieve Guy Morgan. Do it. I'll put another banana on the altar. What is that? Do you hear angels singing? Perhaps the gods have answered your prayer. Hey. What...? - This is Gail Van Ravensway. Hello. Guy Morgan here. How are you? Oh, well, hello, Guy. What a surprise to see you calling this number. Do you hear this? I can justify That's the demo your girl, Katie... ... slipped into my briefcase. And it sounds like money, dear. She gave you a CD? Oh, well. Well, ain't that the berries. Ravi, what frigging god did you pray to? Guy, yeah, it seems someone's not being entirely honest here. Katie, somebody get that door! So... ...that meeting today... ...it was obvious that your dad doesn't get you. He's an idiot for not liking your music. Well, it's... It's complicated. I'm gonna just, uh... Is it as complicated as me... ...getting stuck outside in only a welcome mat? That's not complicated. That is a gift from God. Luke. Katie. What are you doing? Well, it seems your brother is Satan's very own personal Mini-Me. Oh, I know, tell me about it. Come on in. Oh, my God, did you work out today? - Sit down. - Ooh, look at this. - Ha, ha. Some lemonade. - Why, thank you. You know, my stepsister, she has body issues... ...so I don't like to discourage her nudity. That's interesting. - She's absolutely lovely... - Would you like an appetizer? Oh, fromage. I only have cheese. I just got off the phone with Guy Morgan. Your phone. He just loved that little demo you left him. I have underestimated you. It'd make me proud if I cared about you. - I didn't lie about anything. - Oh, but, chicken, you did. At least that's what Guy thinks, now that I've clarified. I told him it was Bev's demo and that you stole it from her. - But you can't do that. That's my song. - It's Bev's song. And Guy can't wait to see her perform it at the Showcase. If you try to contact him, I'll deny everything and lock you in the basement. - She can't sing to save her life. - No, but you can, can't you? Now, let's hear this amazing voice. Like a malignant tumor She's got no sense of humor Just like a swollen blister It's best to just resist her She's not exactly a witch She's just a terrible bi... Well, your lyrics stink. But Guy's right, you've got chops. Do you know what other instruments I'm good at? I have a feeling I could get in trouble with a question like that. I like trouble. Hey, kids. - Good evening, Miss Van Ravensway. - Sorry, I need you to go. Now. Family emergency. I need Bev to help me pass a kidney stone. - So she had a lovely evening. Ta-ta. - Are you trying to ruin my life? I have figured out a way for you to wow Guy Morgan in the Showcase. - So you do think I've improved? - Oh, no, honey. But my month of spiritual devotion has taught me... ...that God works in annoying ways. How am I to wow Guy Morgan if I supposedly can't sing? You can't, but Katie can. - What? - I know. Like I said, annoying. We'll record her voice and you will lip synch. What if I don't want to? Don't you get snarky with me, you ungrateful toad. - I saved your life. - You didn't do anything. - My dad married you. - Yeah, and then he died. I tried to put you in foster care, but they was all fulled up on ugly. - Funny. - I thought it was... ...because you don't wanna look bad. Katie, if you don't sing... ...I'm gonna find a way for that savings your dad left to disappear. That means, you forget college, moving out, you're stuck here with me. But, pumpkin, we're gonna have so much fun growing old together. Why don't you just have her perform if you like her so much? Because, honey, look at you. You are a star. That is what Guy Morgan needs. You, the star. I'm a star. - A bright, gassy star. - Yes, you are. And Guy Morgan is gonna give you a swimming pool... ...shaped just like Colin Farrell. Every part of him. Or, Bev, you could just see every part of Colin Farrell on the Internet. And just leave me out of this. - Okay, so how do we do this? - First rule of Lie Club... ...is don't talk about Lie Club. Which includes you, Katie. As far as everyone knows, you can't sing. And no more talking to Luke or Guy. Are we clear? Crystal. Yeah, Dad, we're about to meet some fresh talent right now. Remember when you signed Jay-Z? No, you passed on him, my bad. Um, this is like that, except it's gonna be brilliant. Yeah. Okay. - Yeah, okay. Bye. - Dude, what'd he say? These guys you told me about are good? Yes. The Oral Majority has potential. They'll be here any second. Talking about potential, how was your little date with Bev? - Her mom kicked me out. - I told you. Bev is drama. Technically, it was Gail's drama. But Bev's interesting, man. She's... I'm worried she's bonkers. See, my last girlfriend, she was hot, but absolutely mental. I need a girl who's not gonna be shipped to the loony bin. Hang on, I'm gonna hit the facilities. Facilities. That's a new one. - Hey, man. Sorry we're late. - Hey, what's good, y'all? Nobody talks to my boy until he comes from the facilities. We're here to impress. - Clear, right? - Got it. When you're fighting just to keep it sane Throw your will At the eye of the hurricane - Sing it out - Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh - Help me sing it out - Eh-oh, eh-oh, eh-oh If you wanna find out who you are Stop running In the end you'll figure out It's all about nothing All night, it's gonna be all right Hey, hey, hey, hey All right Turn your dreams into your life That's good. I'm clean. No one followed me. And I got your intel. Oh, Katie, baby, your life sucks. Trust me, it gets worse. Okay, dude, those guys, they just went Oral Majority on me in there... - I was trying to hold them back... - You're right. They have potential and they're great. But first, my talent-finding friend, promise me no more auditions in the bogs. - The what? - The loo. - Bathroom. Toilet. - Got it. All right. Okay, come on. I wanna show you something. So now I have to rehearse in secret. Why not not rehearse? Make Bev sound bad. What do you care? No song, no savings account. No life. People. Coming. Now. Okay. Dude, what are we doing? The suspense is killing me. Can you grab the mike? Not about to serenade a brother, are you? Dude, with bromance, comes a fine line. That I shall not cross. So sing something. Okay. I'm lost in a world That rattles my brain I'm cleaning up my life From the mess you made Oh, oh Whoa, oh, oh, oh My soul's in debt, but my bills are paid I'd give anything just to make an escape Oh, oh Whoa, oh, oh, oh So you can keep Knocking, knocking, knocking Baby, you're rockin' But there ain't no way I'm ever letting you in He's amazing. Not again So keep on Knocking, knocking, knocking But, baby, you're better off walking 'Cause I ain't gonna let you in Never again I went out on a limb again I guess I had to lose to win I was too confused to know Which way to turn - And she could be a millionaire... - Crap. - Gail needs me to drive her home. - I don't care 'Cause, baby, there's nobody home Nobody's home at all, yeah - What? Did you write that? - Yeah. Reminds me of, um... Uh... - Danger Fruit, right? Danger Fruit. - Ha, ha. Because I wrote their album too. Shut up. Took me forever to find that bootleg online. - I love that album. That's crazy. - Yeah. My dad doesn't know. And he thought the record... ...was a pile of crap. He thinks writing's a waste of time. Because he basically wants me to be like him. Only with better hair. But the first thing I thought when I heard those guys in the urinals was... ...good acoustics. Second thought was these guys, these guys could be great. If you gave them your song. Mate, that's a brilliant idea. - So put them in the Showcase? - Put them in the Showcase. Yeah. You can never tell where this might go You wrote that song today? - You've been home for what, two hours? - It's like an answer to his song. You really like this guy. Yeah, I'm an idiot. You have to sing that for him. What if you sang to him in secret? At the dance. Ta-da. Okay, I know the card's like, really cheesy, but... Oh, God, I hope you like it. Ange, it's beautiful, but are you crazy? No, I know you're crazy. Am not. - What if he doesn't even like me? - You'll both be in disguise. It's your chance to see if he was really flirting with you. I was naked. Of course he was flirting. And why even torture myself? It's not like I can have him. Why not? Tell him how you feel. If he feels the same way, you can reveal your hot self and he won't tell Gail. And if he hates the song, leave the disguise on. Okay. I'm going to the dance. That's my girl. Maurice, no, no. Again, in Franais, longer legs. I wouldn't go in your closet for a little while if I were you. What? Why? Hey. Wake up. Katie! The cat has pooped in my closet. I need you to clean it up. Go. I told you we don't have a cat. Angie, heads up. Katie! What's going on? Nothing. I am, uh, re-organizing and labeling. I... I took up crochet. Do you want new socks? I would make you a sweater, but I hear that the arms, that they're really hard. Oh, you thought you could sneak off and go to the dance. After what you pulled today with Guy. Oh, no, no. Oh, no, no, no. You're on Victor watch tonight... ...tomorrow night and every night. Fun. I'll give Victor all the mothering you don't have time for. Oh, I wish you could be my mommy. I'm off to my cinnamon colonic. Hey. Get down. You're gonna break yourself. Or worse, the furniture. Hello? - Hey. - You look like you're having fun. - Always. Well, I couldn't let you not go to the dance without me. Besides, we have six hours of shirtless Team Jacob. So let's just get this party started. - So is Victor driving you nuts? - I swear to you, he's not human. I mean, can you really blame him, though? Just look at this family. Victor, what are you doing? Oh, no. Great. Eh, she actually looks prettier that way. True. Ugh. Whatever. Why did I ever think that tonight could've been something special. Think Bev's all over Luke at the dance right now? They're probably making out. See? - Victor, give it a rest. - Just check it out. Come on. Luke is gonna produce whoever wins the Showcase. So we need a little insurance. - I know what I'm doing, Mother. Do you? I can't take it anymore, okay? I'm taking my life into my own hands. I'm talking to Luke. - Finally. - Okay, but we have gotta be home... ...before Gail gets here. What about the demon spawn? Mm-hm. Right. Okay, just watch him. Hmm. Is that all you've got, Angela? Ravi? My sister could catch that, jerknut. Put some nuts in that sack, ref. Miss Katie, I am most startled. Obviously. All right. All right. Don't hate me. Okay, don't hate me. I'm sorry. But my name ain't Ravi. It's Tony. - Tony. - Tony Gupta from Jersey. - From Jersey. - I am half Indian. My friends call me Meatball because I'm half Italian. Truth is I always wanted to be an actor. But I never got my shot. I'm working at KFC, and one day, Gail comes in... ...she's like, "Are you Indian?" I'm like, "What?" She's like, "Are you a guru?" I'm like: "Who is asking?" She says, "Someone who's paying for some spiritual guidance." And I'm like, "Whaa! It's a miracle!" I finally get a chance to do a total immersion into a character. Real training and I get paid. Are you kidding me? Ravi is my King Lear. You wanna hear the monologue from My Fair Lady? - Oy, mate. - No, thanks. I'm sorry I barged in. Whoops. Your secret's safe with me, okay? But I need to ask you a favor. - Meatball. - Ha, Meatball. Please watch Victor tonight so I can go to the dance? Are you kidding me? Done. Blow it up. Thank you. Whoa. How am I supposed to find Luke if everybody's got a mask? I never said this was gonna be easy. Let's do some recon. I am Assistant Principal Dorothy Plumberg. No drinking. No texting. No kissing. Luke? No. Luke Morgan? No leaving the premises and no experiencing joy of any kind. Luke? Ugh. Where is he? That reminds me. I got a new act for you to listen to. - Now? - No time like it. - Dude, not again... - We're called Big Pain Ticket. I wanna kiss your apocalypse Wrap you in my Armageddon Sing you a twisted serenade They're good, but I'm worried that chain saw's unsafe. Dude, the chain saw's, like, the best part. I think I found him. Well, he is blond. Oh, my God, what is she doing here? I hate teenage desperation. What are you doing here? Oh, honey, the prize pig doesn't win the blue ribbon... ...by covering up its third best asset. A, what does that even mean and, B, did you just call me a pig? Honey, I saw you making sweet love... ...to a plate of Swedish meatballs at the snack table. It's now or never, babe. - What if she recognizes me? - I'll distract her. Go. - So was I right or was I right? - You were right. You have very cool taste. Any more auditions in the men's... ...and you're fired. - I know your secret. - Which secret is that? I heard you sing at school. You were amazing. Do I know you? - I wanna show you something. - What's your name? Angela, what are you doing? I'd like to make a request. I will make your night. I promise. Miss Van R. Is it true you wanted to be a dancer when you were younger... ...but were never good enough? Who told you that? Well, now, how lovely. But I've seen better dancing in a Filipino prison, sugar. Oh! Really? Because I think I just challenged you to a dance battle. Would Luke Morgan please pick up the white courtesy phone? Luke Morgan, white courtesy phone. Hold on. What is that? You've never seen a guitar before? You hid a guitar in there. You hiding anything else? Follow me. Oh, wow. Madam, while your exquisite eyes tell of a radiant, but mischievous beauty... ...I have grown impatient. Off with your veil, so that I may know the truth. Or not. I'm hoping this answers a lot of your questions. I can see it from the spark in your eyes You believe in all the things You've denied You wanna fly And leave your worries behind Don't you? Don't you? Well, now I'm knocking At your front door And I'm looking for the right cure I'm still a little bit unsure Okay, now take off that veil. Uh-uh. I think I've blown something. Does anyone else smell cinnamon? Move it, fatso. You can never tell where this might go Okay, you are blowing my mind. You have to show me who you are. - We have to go. - What? - Come. - No, Ange. In the middle of a really big moment right now. Someone had an accident and went home. I'm so sorry. What...? You...? Hey. Wait. But who are you? Over here. Go, go, go. - We beat her. - I love you for this. Interesting babysitting attire. I should've known you'd go behind my back again. And that Paula Abdul wannabe, trying to distract me. Don't talk about her like that. Your friend wants to be a choreographer, if memory serves. She might've made a decent one if she hadn't gotten herself expelled. Guess she can kiss them Juilliard dreams goodbye. Look, I'll do whatever you want. Okay? Just leave Ange out of this. That depends if you pull another stunt like tonight, sugar. - I won't. - I'll be taking this. Only her eyes were piercing out through this veil, but her voice... How hot was the girl on a scale of one to 10? - An 11. - The hotness scale only goes 10. Yeah, this girl has love potential. - Ooh, love. - Shut it. We are gonna do this for hours until we get it right. Even if it takes hours. Now, sing like your life depends on it. Because, sugar, it does. We're recording. Plug in the mike Open the curtain Turn on the lights I'm through rehearsing - Dang, she's good, man. - Told you, man. Check this out, all right? Thirty-nine girls in the singing program which means 85 percent... ...have music during the sixth period. So your girl's in one of those rooms. The feeling ignites I'm in control Oh, cut. Cut. That was subpar at best. From the top, pretty please. Amazing grace It's cool, I got this. Ladies, all my single ladies. My boy Luke here has a special favor to ask of you, all right? He needs vocals for this big show coming up, so... - My name is... - Luke Morgan. You will put me in the Showcase. Oh, yes, you will. - Maybe I could ask you to sing first? - I am so gonna rock your world. I love the way you love me, Luke Inside my head every night You come and kiss me good night Whatever you see is what you get Why don't you not suck and do it again, okay? I wanna be with you forever... What is going on in here? Disgusting. You two boys are not in my class. Stop. Wait. Stop. Wait. Stop. I got nothing to lose I've been exposed I'm paying my dues Playing the role - Oh, really? - We are back where we started. This is not good. That's her. That's her voice. Don't think you can get away from me. - Step aside. Step aside. - Please. Wait. Okay. But first, why don't you just both audition for me. Listen... Luke, you are the one for me, yes you are You just don't know it yet Make you believe in me I can be what you want me to be Tonight is the night Where I make you see That I can be Anything, anything, anything I'll make you believe in me I can be what you want me to be Tonight is the night Where I make you see It was you? - Oh, sorry to interrupt. - Oh, no, honey. Interrupt away. I didn't think I'd see you. It was killing me. Because I felt like we connected. Excuse me. Uh, how exactly did you two connect? Yeah, how did we? I mean, we did. - Through... - With your lyrics. They just... - I can't get them out of my head. - My lyrics. Yeah. Well, how wonderful. But, uh, Bev has to prepare for her Showcase audition. Oh, no. She doesn't need to audition. You're in. Do you wanna grab a bite later? - Yeah. Wait. You have a date with detention. Actually, he has a date with me. Dear me, did I not fire you? - I have tenure. - One call and you're wearing a paper hat... ...that says "Welcome to McDonald's. How may I take your order?" - Five calls. - Two calls and text. Two calls, a text, several long e-mails. One text and a Tweet. - One text and a re-Tweet. Oh, for God's sakes, go lick a chalkboard. Fine. I hate you. Okay. Um, I'd love to write a song with you. Let's talk about it tonight? - I'd love to. - Okay, you're on. I've always wanted to write a song. Maybe I'll write about my skin. They say love tightens your pores. What rhymes with pores? Chores. Bores. Sores. Katie, I've got a new task for you. Crushing disappointment. You are gonna write a song for Bev to say she wrote for Luke. A song about what a good kisser Luke is. We can't just give him a song. He wants to write it with you and you know nothing about music. Katie, I'm sorry to say... ...but Bev's gonna need some help keeping your man. Well, I mean, her man. Oh, and that silky smooth sound you hit on the high notes, that is just... It is the sexiest thing I've ever heard. Silky and sexy. That's good. Ha, ha. I don't know why, but I was kind of surprised that you were into music. - Yeah, me too. - What? I mean, I am. Are you okay? You keep checking your phone. Yes. Um... Um... My grandma fell and broke her hip. So she just sends me updates. - Old people and their cell phones. Yeah. - So I just I don't wanna miss anything. - I hope she's okay. But, uh, you were right. I, um... I have been hiding. - From your dead? - Sorry? Dad. Dad. - Hiding from your dad. - Yes. You seemed upset that first day that we met. And I thought maybe your dad had something to do with it. He wants me to be just like him. And I wanna play music. I don't wanna be some suit managing musicians. You feel like he wishes you were a totally different person? Yes. And sometimes I even wish that. - Does that sound stupid? - Yes. Sorry? I mean, no. I mean, no. So who is your favorite artist? Today, it would have to be Moose. Do you mean Muse? Yeah, Muse. That's what I said. Oh. But old-school would have to be John Lennon. Oh, God, I love Lennon. His lyrics are so honest. His voice was just like an angle. - An angle? - Yeah. Learn how to read. Yeah, it would be like, uh, a right angle, you know. It would start out at 90 degrees. And then it would just take you somewhere that you never expected you would go. - Doesn't really make any sense, does it? - Not at all. Maybe you could just ask me another question. I wasn't kidding when I said we should write together. That's not a question. Oh, okay. Um, how about what inspires you to write music? What inspires me? That's a good question. You know, I would have to say... It would be, um... Inspiration! Oh. Wow. Ahem. You know, inspiration is such a deeply, uh... It's personal. It's, like, kind of indefinable, I guess you could say. It's just personal. Oh, my God. - I'm so sorry. No, you're okay. Um... Did it get on your jacket? Oh, I'm so sorry. No, you know what? You're fine. It's just... Oh, no. Uh... - Is Grandma okay? - Uh, no. Um, she has to go to the bathroom. - Oh, she does tell you everything. I should go to the bathroom too. I'll be right back. What are you doing? Get back out there. This is working like a charm. What do you want me to do? Send smoke signals? - No. - Look, you can go back in there, okay? But you are so in over your head you don't even know it. No, I'm not. You know what? I'm so sick of using your words. I don't need you. I can do this on my own. Luke wants me. I talk good. Hey, good luck. - Hi. - Sorry. So let's talk classical music. Who are your favorites? Mozart. Beethoven? Tchaikovsky. You are a Swan Lake girl, aren't you? - I have bad news. My grandma croaked. - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. - I should go. - Look, if you wanna talk about it, l... You know, I would prefer to remember my grandma's memory in silence. Crap. Mah-meh, mah-meh. Victor, if you have stolen my commemorative Gandhi knife again... ...I will make you into a eunuch. You were supposed to be watching Victor. You told me you wanted the chandelier to sparkle. Now I want you to throw out my facelessness. Victor, is Bev in? I'll tell you When you can guess what song I'm playing Is Bev in? Guess what song! It doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard! That's because I don't know how to play! We could be here all day! Well, I could show you some chords! - I thought you wanted to see Bev. - Bev can wait a sec. - Okay. - Yeah? Now, I'm gonna show you three chords. - And we're gonna turn it into a song. - Okay. This is the first chord. It's an E. All right. Second chord. Go to G. Slide it up. Oh, yeah. Okay. There we go. Slide it up again. You got an A. There. We're gonna put it together. - It's gonna be a whole song. - Okay. Now. Very good. You can play, you rascal. If you practice and with that haircut, you could be a Beatle. No, The Stones are a lot better. - Luke. - Hey. Hi. - I keep running into you here. But no partial nudity this time. Um, I didn't know you and Bev had a date today. Oh, yeah. No, I'm kind of surprising her. I'll go get her. He's crazy. So it looks like she lost her head. Oh. Yeah, it's an artist's rendition of what's going on up there. You play a Gallagher. That is so cool. - You know guitars. - No. Uh-uh. I mean, yeah, a little. Not really. Yeah, I know. I like the way the, um... The rosewood holds the, uh... - The notes. - Notes. Notes, yeah. Um... You always seem to disappear. I really wish you wouldn't. You're actually quite cool. You think I'm cool? Luke. Hi. - What a surprise. - Um... - Oh, God, I love your skinny jeans. - Oh, thank you. Uh... I brought my guitar. We could write that song. - Awesome. Yeah. - Okay. Oh, yeah. I guess I gotta go disappear. And can you just wait in there for one minute? - I need your new song. - What? I'm not done yet. Give me what you have so far. - Come on. - Don't break my heart. I will break more than that. - No, that's the lyric. - What? That's it? You have had forever to work on this. Oh, my God, you're giving me a twitch. Fine. Victor? - Victor. - Victor. I know you're there. You're trespassing and you've just entered a world of hurt. Yeah, well, I know all about your surveillance crap, Victor. Your cameras hidden in every nook and cranny, I know. - What kinds of nooks and crannies? - You can't prove anything. Well, I won't tell Mom if you do me a favor. I need Katie to talk to me with no one knowing. - No one can hear her. She can hear me. Don't. - Is it possible? - Say no. You've come to the right man. Watch and learn, ladies. I can hide a mike anywhere. Mom swallowed one. And you don't wanna hear the live feed, trust me. Oh, this is insane. I guarantee my work. - Hey, Victor, set up Katie. - Okay. Here you go, Katie. I put this in my ear? You put it on your ear and you talk. Well, you are ugly, you could probably fit all it in there. Luke, I'm so sorry. I have to give Katie a sisterly talk, you know. She's so high-maintenance. Ha, ha. Anyway, well, where were we? Uh, well, we hadn't started. - Perfect. Let's start. Bev. Uh, Bev, hey, can you hear me? - What do you wanna start with? Bev? - Yes. - What? What? Ha. You wanna sing and I'll play harmony? Uh, no. I was thinking maybe you could sing... ...and I could give you some lyrics that I wrote. That sounds good, okay. - I... Um... Yeah. They are, um... Um... Don't break my heart. Don't break my heart. Before I give it to you. Before I give it to you. Don't break my heart before I give it to you, okay. Don't tell me no. - Don't tell me no. Before I ask you to. Before I ask you to. Don't tell me no, before I ask you to. - Yeah. - That's good. Um... Thanks. Don't break my heart. More? Don't say it doesn't fit. Don't say it doesn't fit. Before you try it on. Before you try it on. Don't say it doesn't fit before you try it on. Try it on. - I like it. - Thanks. Ha, ha. Um, there's too much to lose. - There's so much to lose. Too much to lose. Too much to lose. To be wrong. - To be wrong. Too much to lose to be wrong. - Yeah. That's good. Yeah. More? You got any more? Yeah. - And it feels like there's something here. And it feels like there's something here. And it feels like there's something here. But I wanna see it before it disappears. But I wanna see it before it disappears. - Yeah. Do you like that? And if there's something real between me and you. And if there's something real between me and you. If there's something real between... - Or are we both open to. Don't break my heart before I give it to you Don't tell me no before I ask you to Don't say it doesn't fit before you try it on There's too much to lose to be wrong And it feels like there's something here But I wanna see it before it disappears And if there's something real Between me and you Well, are we both open to All these possibilities So many little possibilities Who wants pie? Ugh! Sorry. Um, I was just gonna go get some pie and thinking: "Why should I get pie for myself. There might be other people that want some pie?" I want pie. No, Katie, there's no pie needs here at the moment. Thank you. You know what? I should go. Um, I've got some acts to finalize for the Showcase so I'II, uh... We were singing. And we were doing things. And it was amazing. All of it. And I'll catch you later, okay? Okay, I'll walk you out. - Okay. - Okay. What are you doing in my bed? While waiting for you, I meditated so strenuously that I fell asleep. Mr. Victor, time for your weekly meditation. Today, we are working on, uh, silence and potty training. Oh, sit. I said sit. What in the name of Bhuvaneshwari? Holy cow. Uh, a bottle of wine ago, I was gonna be sweet as sugar... ...and apologize for living up to the stereotype of stepmotherhood. Dumb. You know, but making you watch my real daughter steal the boy you like... ...and the song you wrote. You're saying you're sorry? Oh, bless your heart. No, no, no. I came to my senses and I realized it was better to just tell you the truth. You are never gonna amount to anything. My mom is a beyotch. And you're a sneaky, sneaky spy, Mr. Victor. How many cameras do you have? Enough to know your accent's faker than my mom's soul. Oh, and don't get the dumb idea to throw that Showcase. Because I talked to a lawyer. And he found a loophole that allows me to access that money your daddy left you... ...should I need it for a medical reason. You know, hello, longer legs. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Before you go... - I'll sing for Bev. Don't worry. Well, that was easier than I thought. Now, go and make me a vodka tonic. Hold the tonic. Her reign of terror's gotta stop. I'm in. What do we do? Look, there's nothing you can do. If you try to help, it's just gonna make it worse. That woman is a demon spawned from darkness itself. I wish she'd go straight back to... Hello, Ms. Gail. Have you, uh, released your mind from the shackles of thinking today? - I'm working on it. - Very good. - How was your meditation? I hate you. Very good. You look pretty. I know. That broad ain't getting away with ruining your life. I'm pooping in her bed tonight. Victor, I thought you hated me. Are you an idiot? You're the only person who knows my birthday. The only one who says goodnight to me. The only one who makes me mac and cheese. You're annoying and ugly... ...but I sort of love you. I sort of love you too. But just promise me you're not gonna do anything, okay? - You too. - Oh, come on. - Just... No... Ple... - Just... No. Just... - No. Tony. - Just one... Okay. All right. Well, now I get to go fold Bev's delicates. - Have you heard of knocking? - Ever heard of I don't care? Where'd you put my blue blouse? Oh, okay. Okay, which one of these do you like better? - You actually want my opinion? - God, I know. What's wrong with me? You know how you're a bitch and I act like I don't care, but truth is I'm sensitive? - Actually... - I need someone to talk to like a sister... ...and you're better than nothing. I'm nervous about tonight. Oh, my God, why did I just tell you that? I don't know. It's like my whole body is freaking out. I have hives on my butt. I can't tell Mom and I can't talk to Luke about it. He'll say something like: "Oh, one minute you're talented and we're connecting... ...and the next minute you're self-involved and histrionic." - What does that even mean? I hate history. - He said that? Listen, Toadie, he's not falling for you, he's falling for me. I just don't know who me is anymore. Why are you nervous? You're not really singing. All you have to do is stand there and look pretty. Have you ever thought about how that makes me feel? You have talent. You could go on American Idol and forget about the rest of us. This is, like, my only chance. Pretty doesn't last very long. Just look at Mom. You think I'm talented? If you tell anyone I said that, I'll deny it. Wear the blue blouse. It makes your eyes pop. This better work. Because if I go down, you're go down with me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's up, my party people? Yeah. All right, all right, all right. Let's get this show started. Welcome to the stage, my boy, my British biscuit and y'all's host for the night... ...Luke Morgan. Are you amped for the Wellesley Academy of the Arts Showcase? Good.
