Come on, you'll get late... - No, you can! Because, Vithal is accompanied by Rakmai at that temple. Why don't we have that? That's a really weird story. Earlier, we used to have an idol of Rakmai at the temple. She left, quite suddenly. - What do you mean? They say, that our village lost her favour. Won't she come back, ever again? We've waited for her for 15 years. But she never returned. What now? Well, Rakmai (Rukmini) knows, nobody else does. Let's go now! You ask too many questions! Hey, point! - Yes? Do you see the bus? - No, buddy. Then, let's go home. - Bajya, sit down! Ramya, get me a bottle. - Yes. It's the last, one each. - Give it to me. Take it! - ls that all? - Yes. Bajya, I brought a crate! Did you see Sunny Leone's video? Surya, let me see! Everything looks tiny on my iPhone. It's big. - What? The image. - Okay! Bajya! Want to see Sunny Leone fighting? - That's okay. Have a look! No, it's okay. - No, have a look! Point, do you see anything? Hold it higher. What the heck! See if you can see the visitors. He's always doing all this. As if you don't? They won't come today. Oh, no. I hope they will be here. Or Bhushan will be left stranded like all of us. Unmarried. That's a really strange wedding party! The girl is going to get married and take the boy away! It's a wedding party from the Tekawade village. The Tekawade village? - Yes! They say, they don't have any girls in the village. - What? It's been around 15 to 2O years. The village hasn't had any female births. - What? The girls' school in the village was closed ages ago. There are thirty boys in each class and no girls, whatsoever! They got rid of the girls. They abandoned them at orphanages. They sent wives back to their maternal homes for having girls. Some women even committed suicide! That's why the village had such a terrible reputation... ...that no one wants to marry their daughters into families here. Something really strange happened the other day. Come on... - It's a girl! - Hurry! She's swallowed a lot of water. - Watch it. Take it easy. Move aside! - Step back. Let her go! - Watch him! Hey, get back! - Move! Aunt, press it right, okay? I told you so! Where am V? - Tekawade! Yes! - What? Forget about the girls... ...even the corpses of girls shy away from the village! - She's gone! I had to give her mouth to mouth! Now, if anyone has the itch to marry, he lives with his wife's family. He leaves the village and goes to another, to be the son-in-law. So you see, things are rather complicated at this place. Here's the bus! - How did this happen? Point, sort this out. The bus is here. I'll go home. - You're so drunk! Let's go. - I'll open some champagne. Come on. - Hurry up. What is going on? What's up? Hello, Bharat Dada. Hello. Why is he here? He's here, for the same reason as us. Oh, no! - What did he say? Nothing. The boys wanted to drink at the bus stop. Yes. We're here for Bhushan's wedding. We have a responsibility as friends, right? - Yes. What about me? - What about it? - What? No, Bharat Dada, you have to make a move and do this. What? - Do what? You have to take the initiative. - Yes. I've no arguments with that. Let's go. - Alright, follow us. Why did you have to do that? Useless! - Come on! Yes! - Oh! There's a bus filled with them! - Yes. Hello and welcome! I am Bharat, Bharat Rao Zende. Thatthawacle. - Tekawade. Tekawade. Surya, did you see that? Let me see. - Now, that's a loaded 16GB ram! She's the bride! - What? Hey! - Hey! - Welcome, ladies and girls. You're all losers, each and everyone of you! - Yes, so... So, today, our village... ...you see, ever since we built the wedding hall... ...for the first time, we're hosting a wedding. - Move it. And on this occasion I would like to say that... -Bajya! Our village is filled with...hey!7 I'm speaking here! Oh, my foot is crushed! I'm not done talking yet! "There is a strange wedding party at the village." "lt's like moonlight, in the middle of the day." "There is a strange wedding party at the village." "lt's like moonlight in the middle of the day." "The girl has come to marry the boy." "The wedding party is zesty, the village is drunk." "Pump up the volume, DJ, your mom... "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "The horse comes to the water, the water has come to the horse." "I am losing it, looking at all the girls." "The horse comes to the water, the water has come to the horse." "I am losing it, looking at all the girls." "The grass is green and the love is blooming." "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump it, pump it!" "yes!" "It's such a headache! We are all losers." "The girl is the hero in a world of boys." "It's such a headache! We are all losers." "The girl is the hero in a world of boys." "The girl is strong and ruling the roost." "Pump up the volume!" - Pump it!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "The bridegroom comes along demurely." "The bride is getting even more pricey." "It's time for the wedding rites." "This is the moment of the holy wedded bliss." "Strange events, which won't happen again." "The husband cries on his way to the in-law's home." "There is a strange wedding party at the village." "lt's like moonlight in the middle of the day." "The girl has come to marry the boy." "Pump up the volume, DJ, your mom... "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" "Pump up the volume, DJ, for your mom's sake!" You can see the strange wedding party of this strange village. There are no marriageable girls here, anymore. How will they marry? Can we get married? - But, she must be married. With video journalist Praveen Shetty, Nilima Kulkarni reporting at Tekawade. Billo! - Hey! The girl's gone, I'm done. Oh, no. Oh, m'!- Dear God Almighty! What the heck! His cow gets a calf, too. But we can't get lucky! Brother. - What? Here's your tea. - I'll take it. Do you want some tea? - No, I don't. Son-in-law'? He's not listening. Son-in-law. How long will you keep milking the cattle? What should I do, then? Start thinking of having a kid, now. You've been married for 12 years. - Right. We are getting embarrassed in public. Why are you embarrassed if I can't have a kid? Mangal, I told your mom! The men from this village are no good. But, no way! He's a good man, it seems! What should I do with the man, now? Wipe the tea off your moustache. Or the ants will swarm all over. Brother, why do you keep talking about that? We're doing fine. Really? - Yes. God willing, we will have a child, too. Forget about God! Your husband has to be willing, first. Bro... We've been through umpteen tests with the same number of doctors! Should I keep hankering after that? Rani! Uncle, listen to me. - Sure, tell me. Let's clean up a little here. That's okay. Why don't you think about it? - What do you mean? I mean, give your Mangal a sweet little brother! We'll take care of him. If you don't want to talk about it, that's the last word! I would like that! Listen to me, I'm telling you one last time. What is it? Sell all of this and come to our village. Does moving there guarantee having kids, automatically? What the... Mangal! What's for breakfast? I can't talk to him, he's too insulting. - Make semolina pudding. Brother, you're too willful. Why do you go after him? You know what he's like! Okay, so what? Now, don't get all cranky. Have some tea before you leave. I told you, I don't want any tea. See if you can get any money for the milk, today. That's what I'm going for. Sister-in-law will be coming over, right? - Yes. We have to arrange for the cowshed too, right? - I remember that. Take the milk pail in. See if he can leave, today. Bring that here. Kishan! Can't you watch where you're going? Fool! You numbskull! He's bashed up your BMW! Kishan! What have you done? I just couldn't brake the bike. - How is that possible? You've dented it. - What? You dented it! Look at that! - Yes. How's going to pay for that? I will never do that again. If that happens again, you won't see this mosquito repellent spray. Wait, let me teach you a lesson. No! Not that. - She's here! Bajranga! Bajrang! Listen, Bajrang, I want to give the milk. Go ahead, then. There's the dairy. Can I take your leave? Why don't you take it? I won't take it. Can I leave? Watch out, sir. - Listen... Why does he always do that? Why do you always do that? Aunt Shidore? - Listen to me. You know, he's shy of women. Right? Listen to me. - Yes! I wonder, how will he marry? Listen to me! - Now, you can't... ...be shy of women, can you? Pat. - See? Now, see, when the whole world was created... ...there was only one man and one woman! If the man had felt shy of the lady at that time... Right? If he were shy... ...would it be possible to populate the entire world? Oh, my God! You're just too much! I want money. - For what? For milk, that's what! - Whose milk? I give you milk every day, right? I'm owed money. How can I pay you? You've already taken so many loans. What about those? You've been deducted the money, for the past 3 months. That's the interest. - Listen to me, please. What's the deal with the principal amount? I've to perform my brother's annual memorial rites. Help me. I've had two kids, despite my advanced years. Take a leaf out of your dad's book! Here. That's Rs. 200 extra. That's okay. I'll adjust it. As always. I'll see you around. Bye, Kishan! Oh, God! All I ask is for my body to be fit. And specifically, let my liver function really well. I don't wish for anything else. Praise the Lord. Sorry, I've slipped up. Dad, what's up with you early in the morning? Should I tell mom? Should I? Don't do that. Your mom... - What? I just told her yesterday, that I've quit drinking. Listen, I won't have you saying terrible things like that. Why? And switch that off. Put on something nice! Why don't you play Kumar G? Yes! ' Yes! That's what I'm talking about. My boy. What are you doing? - What? You had a drink! You drank! My boy! You're going to have kids in the future. They will sit and drink with you! Those kids will have kids and they will drink together! This legacy will live on! We're doomed! - Stop it. That's enough. Don't howl early in the morning. I don't think I'll get married in this life, not in this village. What's up, boss? Have you had your first cup of tea for the day? Get lost, you! Great. Aunt Vatsala! I'll be there. Stop yelling! Why can't you be ready? - Yes. Here. - Okay, here's a thought. Why do you need so much milk, every day? Your husband and the boy are already hitting the bottle. I have two cats, you see. It's for them. How does it matter to you? You're so nosey! Wretched milkman! He has to crib. - No wonder they can't pay. I have... Sir. - What? I need some cash. Can you arrange for it? The school board has an education committee. I'm on that. On what? - The body. Which body? - The education committee. And the elections are approaching. So, I'll need money. You give me some. Sir, it's my brother death anniversary. How did your brother die out of the blue, without prior notice? I guess he forgot to inform you, before he passed away. And here you are, asking for cash! That's just not done! It's the anniversary rites. Can't you... - Kishan. He said no, right? - Yes. Leave. - Go on. There he goes! - Go on. This one just has women tussling with each other! Ram, who are you chatting with? She's my Face book friend and she's really slick! What's her name? - Allina DaCruz. DaCruz? - Yes. She's from Germany. Is she fair? - Just a little. She said, she'll be right back. - Oh, doggie! How much for this load of bricks? A truckload of bricks is for 20,000. - 20,000? That's okay. Who are those two boys, who are dressed alike? My employer's sons. They're twins. They're born just ten minutes apart. But, they look really different. Yes. One takes after mom and the other, after uncle. What? They call their dad, uncle! What do they call their uncle, then? Their uncle... That's none of your business! Hey! - Come on. - Uncle is here. Surya, Ramya. What about the Vodaf collections? Uncle, we'll get it in the evening. What about the bricks? The ones which were baked too long and got charred? You just can't focus on your work! Hello, sir. - Hello. I want to build a cowshed. Congratulations! Go for it. That's why I'm talking to you. - What? What if I pay for the bricks, sand and material... ...the next month? Will that do'? Build it the next month, then. When you have money. Let's go. I really need it. - Hey, Kishan. - Yes. Didn't you understand what uncle said? He has lots to do. Get going. Go on. Leave. - Go on. Ram, watch it. - Let it be. That's heavy! Listen to me. - I won't listen, I'm leaving. I won't talk to you. - Listen... Hey, boys! Your uncle is leaving. Escort him to the bus stop. - I'll go. No, forget about it. I'll go myself. Tell him. Talk about that. Go on, talk to him. - Yes. So, listen to me. - He'll talk to him. As discussed during their infancy, let's get your Seeta and Geeta... ...married to our Ramesh and Suresh, this summer. Let's talk about anything but that. The cradle of infancy is broken, now. We store onions in it. Onions? - I'll let them stay unmarried... ...rather than marry these losers. What is he saying? - See you! Brother! How can you say that? No one is interested in my boys! Oh, no! Now that I am to speak here... ...even the mic is whistling. This is such a coincidence! We are inaugurating a megacity here! We will build an ultra modern township here. The idea being, we should convert our village into a town. Soon enough, we will have the MIDC here. - Come along. That will add to the development of our village. Come here. - And that is why... ...my son is here. - Picture. A youthful leader of the villager and your beloved Vice Sarpanch... ...Bharat Rao Zende! I welcome him here and wish him all the very best. Along with him is the brand ambassador, the actor... ...G Vilas. I would like to thank All of us will buy plots in this megacity. We will create imbalancement there. Thank you! What did he say? - lmbalancement. What's that'? - Investment. Oh! Okay, if anyone wants photos with me, tell them to line up. There's nobody. They've all gone home. Take the packet and leave. Here, give him the packet. It looks so real! It is real. - Feed him, come on. What the heck? Megacity Tekawade? Mr. Sarpanch (head of council). - What's up, Kishan'? What is going on on my land? Your land? Silly fellow! You handed it over to us. I paid off your debt. - You did? Then, return the land documents to me. - See? What is it? What? You carry on. - He's insane. Come along. Let's go. - What a nuisance! Wait! Drop me to the bus stop. - Hurry up! Brand ambassador. Why are we discussing this? The land is next to the road. You'll mint money. Take the money quietly and live a good life. Why shouldn't we discuss this? It's my land and I want to farm. I don't want the money. What is the point of farming? Should farmers toil for all of their lives? No! - Should they only wait for rain? As head of council and vice head of council, we have duties. The farmers should get some money. But... - Tell me, do you or don't you want the money? Listen, my land... - You're doing it again! Be nice. It's better for you, that way. Or you'll need a plot of land, some day. In our megacity. You'll have to buy. Come on. Let's have a selfie before the megacity board. Come along! Here. Okay? I already owe you. No. I'm giving it, since I have it. Take it. Take that. Make sure you perform the rites properly. Kishan. What about the matter regarding your land? What the heck! They're building a megacity there. - What? I gave my brother's land as security to the Sarpanch. They hosted the inauguration there, today. On, God! You know, I'm going to do a number on their megacity and them! Come and sit, ma'am. We'll leave as soon as the bus is filled. Come on. How much more can it take? Should I sit on top of your head? You bet! How can you stuff in so many people? Sir! What are you screaming for? Where do you want to go? - Tekawade. Oh, my. Why don't you sit? Where should I sit? - Please, have a seat! Sorry. Give me one minute, okay? Get down! Get down all of you! Please. Kishan, why are you sitting here? - What do you think? I'm expecting guests today. What's it to you? Work your fields. Get up, Shiva. Here comes our Mercedes! Mangal, take the flatbread. - I'll be there. I've offered a piece of flatbread. Take it. - Yes. - Yes. The guest is here! - Give me that. Come along. Here's my girl! - Hurry. Come on. - Look at her! Uncle! - Welcome. Oh, my! ls she here? - Welcome, sister-in-law. How are you? - That's okay, enough. Wait! - Bless me. That's okay. - Can you do that? Ward off the evil eye. Don't let it jinx you. Well done. So, how was the journey? Come along. - Come on in. Let's go. I'm going to serve lunch at once. Why are you serving lunch? Make some tea. Take the bags, quickly. Come on. - Sure. Ramesh! - Tell me. This is going to create tension in the village. There's a new model on the scene! At Kishan's house. - What? Look behind you. A MacBook Pro, in our village! She's mine. Uncle, dad never let me visit although this is a lovely village. But, I had to come here because of him. Wash it. - Okay. Brother suffered a lot. He really put himself through a lot. The man had no vices whatsoever! And how does he die? Of a heart attack! But, he really loved Rupali. I wish, he could see her getting married. Marriage is for later. Okay? I will fulfill his wish, first. What? - Uncle, I want to be an agricultural officer. You can do that, later. Once you get married, my duty as an uncle is done. No way. I'll be an agricultural officer and the rest will follow. You'll do it. Okay, do whatever you want. Sister-in-law, listen to me. You must stay here now. - What? Why are you living in Pune on rent? - Yes. Why do you want to take on our burdens? We'll see about how to manage that, later. And if it's bothering you so much... ...pay me Rs. 25,000 rent per month. What is wrong with you? She's the only child I have. Right? This broken down shack will belong to her, after I pass away. Uncle, I would really love to live here. Wake up! - What? What? How? - Listen! What was that sound? - It's... ls that an earthquake? - Don't get under the bed! Is it over there? Over there? Come here, listen to me! - Leave the house! Stay right here. - What? Somethings gone on, look at it. - ls that the earthquake? What is... - This has to... We can get it done. - Look! Bring the bricks and sand. Get to work. - Hey! What is going on here? What are you doing? Uncle! - Uncle? Me? You want to build a cowshed, right'? Uncle, I'm giving the bricks. - I'm giving the sand. I brought the boards. - I hired the labourers. Why? Uncle, we will build a cowshed for ten cattle. - Yes. But, I have only three. A cow, a calf and a buffalo. Uncle, you'll have more sooner or later. And we have enough male buffaloes. That's true. Right. But, I don't have that much money. - Yes. Uncle. We're not crazy to accept your money... What? - What happened? Smear it around. - I stepped into the cow dirt. Why don't you watch the ground, sometimes? Dad said, build a modern cowshed. And have stalls built for the buffalo. - Yes. But... What? What is this? Listen, dear! What is it? - Look at this. Look at this! It's a miracle! What has happened? I can hear hens clucking in the basil plant. That's you, burping! - Look at this! What? Mangala, you're such a dimwit! Look at that! Who sent this hens here? - Oh, God! Are they blind? Why are they here? - Come on! Uncle! Now, I'm your uncle, too? Is my home a warehouse? Why did you bring them here? The guest are here. You will need chicken to feed them. Chicken? - There are 200 egg bearing hens. Aunt! - Oh, no! - A nice side business for you. You don't have to go to him for money, every time. Right? Why are you so bothered? Uncle is super strong! And there's more. I get it. Now, leave. What is with you? Bring it in. What is that cupboard for? - Don't you get it? It's a fridge. With Bingaro beer. Super strong and absolutely chilled. Watch it! - It Will fall! Loaded, only for you. When it's over, call and ask for more. No sweat! I'll deliver at home. After all, I am in the service industry. Uncle, but... - But'? A loving gift? With sunglasses on? What is it'? - No! Whose buffaloes are these? They are yours, uncle. What the heck? Am I your uncle, too? What for? I don't have a male buffalo! My dad said, every buffalo gives 2O liters of milk. That's 80 liters per day. - So? And if you wan to deliver milk, you can use the BMW. The BMW? But, why are you giving me all this? How long can you drive that motor scooter? I know, I can't help it. - Now, ride the BMW with pride. Okay. - What? What are you doing? - Well... What is that'? - Give me the keys to your scooter. What for? - Well... ...my dad said, I will drive it, from now on. He said, a man should know his place. He's right about that. Take this. - Really? With 80 liters of milk, I deserve a BMW, right? - Yes. RUDE! - Oh, my! What happened? Why are you dancing? - No, keep all of this. Please, do read the card. The card? Are you educated? - See you. Okay. - This is really tiny. Oh' my God! But! BMW! Oh, my God! Uncle, you'll break your leg. Bharat Rao, don't do that. I have to deliver the milk. What's going on? Get down. Come on. Pick it up. I didn't do anything! - What the... What is your problem? You've got no sense! Don't lift him up! Carry the milk cans. Why? Don't do this, please. It's 200 liters of milk. It takes a long time to milk. Sit in the car. - In the car? Not a 2 wheeler! A 4 wheeler! Yes! Uncle! You forget the measuring cup. Thanks for giving it in time. The bottom line is a different matter. Uncle, where do we have to deliver the measuring cup? We have 47 houses. Let's go. - What? Bharat Rao, don't do this. We're late. We've to deliver to many places. The boys are delivering your milk! Why are you getting so tense? That's not the point. Dad is also in a rush. Pandey, hurry up with the ploughing. - Come on. Dad! - What? Hey, get going. Fetch some water. - Yes! What? - Hello. - Mr. Kishan, don't sit on the ground. Come on, stand up. Here, have some areca nut. - Yes. You came yesterday, but I was in a bad mood. Bharat Rao told me you want the land. Turn around and keep walking. Stop, when you get tired. You'll get all the land right up to that point. Don't tease a poor man. I never tease anyone! I swear on my dead wife. Never! - Yes. I don't want your land. Then? - Just give back my brother's land. - Ah! Bharat Rae, get the documents. Yes. The documents are ready. We can finish this at once. But... - But, what? You have a condition, too? It's simple! Get your niece married to my son. Will you do that? Mr. Kishan'? Mister? Yes, tell me. Where are you? - Me? I'm slightly tied up with something. Are you done? - Not yet. Put some effort into it. It's not helping. Listen, forget about you and me. Let's do this on the 17th. It's a wedding. Let me take care of my brother's death anniversary. After that, I will... Here goes. Brother, is that you? Come into the courtyard. Are you there? Alright, now talk to me. Really? Sweety delivered? Oh, my! I'll tell him. Listen! Sweety delivered five pups. Give me that phone. - What? Why are you so cranky since morning? Why are you sitting with a kerchief tied around your head? Because my pocket is torn and I don't have anywhere to put it. It's useless trying to talk to you. - Make some tea. It's the fifth. - When? It's your fifth cup of tea! When, it seems! This man is incapable of understanding anything. We have a major event coming up and he's asking, when! It'll break! What is wrong with you? I've got a splitting headache. Can I give you a head rub? - Bash it in with a grinding stone. One moment. - Come along, priest. Keep it here. - Yes. One moment. Pick up all that stuff. You can't keep anything here without asking uncle. Pick it up! Stop. - Hey! - Rupali! He's my dad, Rupali. And this is the priest, who has come for the veneration. Let me introduce you. - He's Suraj. We know each other. - How come? We were together at MPSC classes at Pune. Oh, right. But, you never mentioned it. I didn't know it... - Pick it up, at once. It's already a mess. She's been calling me all clay... ...and hasn't cooked any food yet. At what time did I tell you to come here? You would have been in time for my final rites. Hurry up. We got coconuts, too. - Let's go. They had to be delivered. Why are you telling me? Sort out the dry fruit before the veneration. - Okay. I'll do it. - Rupali, when did you arrive? What's going on? - Why are you getting so hassled? What else should I do? Kishan, you've arranged for the anniversary rites, nicely outside. Outside? - Yes. Such a great soul will not be born again. On behalf of our corporator... ...we are going to ensure... ...that Bhagwan Thorat will get the Bharat Ratna award. Applause! Bhagvvan and I were childhood friends. We played hide and go seek in school. At that time, I was sure he would be a cop and I'd be the thief. What are you saying? - Come on! Once, when we were in Pune during the Ganesh festival... ...Bhagvvan Rao and I met at the Khandoba temple in Budhwar Peth. That's when he told me... ...your son is so regal looking. I want him to be my son-in-law. That's what he said. Bhagwan, you are great! You are truly great. We're doomed! Stop it! He's going to fall! - Watch out! Help him up. Oh, no! You're tired, right? - Yes. Uncle. - Yes? What happened today, or rather all the gifts we are getting daily... ...that's all for me, right? We had the entire village in our house for lunch, today. It's all for me, right? Not really, but... ...it is. What can I say? Everyone wants to marry me, right? Don't get involved in any of this. Listen to me. You and your mom can leave at the earliest. I'm being honest. Why should I leave, every single time? What do you mean? Dad always told me a story. Once there was a village. A king lived there with his queen. They gave birth to a lovely princess, one day. The king and queen were very happy. But, the village didn't appreciate that. Everyone was angry with the princess. The king's mom told the queen... ...we wanted a prince! But, you've given birth to a girl. You're jinxed! Do one thing. Abandon her somewhere. Or else go away with her, forever. We will get the king a new queen. But, the king wanted his princess. He loved the queen and the princess. That's why, he took them both and left the village. They never returned to the village. And as I grew up... ...l began to realise, that I was the princess of the story. Dad left the village just for me. Rupali, it's true. The village didn't prosper after all of you left. Everything was ruined. Later, there were no girls being born. That's why, this princess isn't going to leave. I will stay here. I want to change the end of dad's story. That's if you stand by me. Rupali, we will change things together. I have to get something else. - What? The Sarpanch robbed my brother's land. I want to get that back. How? Just call everyone, now. Tell them, lam willing to get married. Susheel! Are you having stomach cramps? I'm going for the bridegroom selection. Get out of my way. Hurry up. I need to have something darned. Darn what? I stitch clothes. - What do you think this is? "Who is she standing in the orchard?" "Sir, I'm standing guard." Hey, you...His name is really difficult to remember. What is it? What are you doing? Growing a moustache? You can't grow them like that. You need this, for that. What? Why don't you catch my drift? Oh, no! He's hitting a grown up boy! I keep telling you... ...why won't you get married? - What's his problem? Oh! - Have you seen how jaundiced he looks? Why did he come here? - Now, don't say that. I'm here, you can't match up. When will she arrive? - Where is... Bajya? - Hey! - We are all faulty. Bajya! - You're faulty, too! - Bajya! Bajya! Bajya! - Be quiet! Don't talk so much. Uncle is here. Surya... - What are you saying? When will the girl arrive? - God! But, she has to choose first... - Hey! Don't hit me! - Back off! What is with you? - Hey, listen! You know what... - Be quiet, all of you! Yes. - Sit. Is this the Masod marketplace? They are all losers. Calm down! Sit down. - Take this. Vice chief, move your backside! Stop it. - He's all cheek! Rupali will come here, soon. But, what did I say? But... - But... ...don't make any noise. - Okay. Rupali! Rupali! She's coming this way! Oh, my! Move it! Hey! God! Are they all here to get married? I would say this is a less number. Suresh is here. Glad to see you. - Two down! Let them breathe! - What happened? What is going on? What is it? - Pick him up! Did you see Sunny Leone's new video? - Where? Get up! - Where is it? What happened to him? - He had an epileptic fit. Why? - Wen... ...he's not used to seeing such a beautiful girl. He lost it. One moment. All of you are here, willing to marry like fools. But... - But. - But. She has some conditions. - Yes. - Yes. Tell them. My first condition... ...the boy has to be self reliant. That's a lot who have gone with the first condition. My second condition. The boy has to be over 21 years old. We've lost so many with the second! My last and final condition. The boy has to be educated. They're all gone. - There are a few. Where are my slippers? What? - Go on in. You've lost your chance. What on earth? No wonder! Get back in there! Why did you come back? Dad pushed me back in. - He's useless, anyway. See? Hey, guzzler. You're not 21, yet. - This is tough. You're not educated, either. Did you pass the tenth grade? I gave the exam four times and still didn't pass. I am the most educated amongst all of us. Alright, fine. Submit your educational certificates and age proof. Ma'am, I have my certificate here. Right now? - Not now. After 2 days. Come and give this to uncle. - Uncle? Who should we give it to? - To me. - To you? - To you. Are you going to stay, now? - Yes. Get going. Fools! And it's another game! Uncle! - What? The farming is nice. Stay for lunch. - No. - I... No. - Why? - Please, stay. What is it? Tell me. What's for lunch? - We're having mutton. Forget it, then. - No! I thought, Suraj would stay with the rest. - Got it? - Okay. Right. - Wm do. How can he stay? - You have to come then. why? - He's different. And of course... That's okay. No big deal. Come on, let's have lunch. How are you doing? Go and freshen up. - What did you cook? Eggplant? Hurry it up! - Almost done. Here you are. Vice chief! You've passed 10th grade! This calls for sweets. When? - See? Just now. No one will guess, right? Even those who made the original won't know. I don't know what you are saying. There are all zeroes here. It says, pass down below. It does say pass here. One certificate for the two of you? There's another behind the first one. Oh! ' Yes! That's okay. So tell me, how much did you score in social science? Social? We didn't have that subject. - Yes. I can see that, by looking at you. - Yes. Do you remember the name of your school? - Yes. St. Tams. - What? Ten Tams? St. Ams! Sant Tambdebaba School. - Yes. Can we go in? - Yes. You can't go in just like that! Uncle! My certificates! Hey, wait up! I have certificates, too! So what? I'll go in. - No, I'll go in. I will go in! - No, I will! One moment. I will decide, who goes in. Wow! So, can I leave? Bajya, dad is here! Your certificate? What's the time, friends? My watch has stopped working. It's too old. I guess, I'll get a nice new watch at the wedding. No! Bharat Rao, you can go in. Didn't we give you stuff? - We did! He gave a Redo. So, he goes first and all of you will follow one by one. Do you get it? Redo! It sets the tone, right here. Loser! Excuse me! - What? Why are you sitting on the floor? Sit on the bed. That'll do. - Okay. What is your name, again? I am the vice chief of council of Bharat Rao Zende. Call me anything you want. Dear. Sir. Bharat Rae. Dada... no, not that. Bharat Rae? What kind of wife do you want? There's no doubt about that. Someone just like you. Just like you. Let's take a selfie. Sure, we'll do that, later. Sit and let's talk, first. - Okay. So? What do you think of your wife? "She laughs and it is moonlight. She blushes and she is alluring." "She is captivating, when I see her. The queen of my heart." "Simple and yet devastating, is what I want." "Simple and yet devastating, is what I want." "Her body is flaming hot, which makes me tremble." "In every par-t of me, love has overwhelmed me." "This solitude is killing me. Come closer." "Every direction will whimper, when Rupali will be mine." "Rupan!" "Simple and yet devastating, is what I want." "Simple and yet devastating, is what I want." "The mole on her neck, I seek, every night." "I want to touch the creaminess of her lips." "I should tangle with her body and lose myself to her touch." "My heart will be blissed out, when Rupali is mine." "Rupan!" "Simple and yet devastating, is what I want." "Simple and yet devastating, is what I want." Take this. - I don't want the water. That's okay. What? You want water, right? - Yes. Take it easy. So, is this what you think of about your wife? Alright, we'll see how to go about it. What? Go about it? No! Bajya, your dad's here! What is wrong with you? Ma'am, I'll leave. - Ma'am? Bajya is out! Here he is. What happened? Why did you shout? Well, that... - He is sweating! Did she pinch your cheek like she pinched mine? No way! She must have held his hand, like me. You guys are losers. She sat on my lap. What? I was just sat and did nothing! Pinch your mom's cheek! - He's crazy. Come on! There's no fodder for the buffalo, and no milk. Bajya! - Go! You're useless, anyway. Go. Oh! - Get going. - Hey It's a Rado. - Go on. You've lost the Rado. Where there's a wish, there's no way and vice versa. This village is in bad shape. It's true. Actually, it's a lovely village. You bet. But, what are they doing for supposed development? It's nothing. Sell the lands, buy cars. Wear gold chains. That's what they call development. Now, they've come up with the megacity concept. The state transport buses don't come the village, yet. There is no chemist, but there is a beer shoppe. There's no hospital, but, there's a bar. So, tell me. What if everyone gives up agriculture? Farming is useless. If ancestors say that, they are bound to listen. It's tough. But, with you as agricultural officer something will happen. That will take time. How are you going to manage now that you're getting married? It was just a first meeting. Forget about me. What about your wedding? No way! I won't marry. Why? I don't want to get into that mess. I have to take care of my dad. He can't roam around cutting hair, all his life. Once I get a job and make some money... ...l will get him a nice place like this one. Then, he can sit and farm all his life. My dad wanted to do that, too. That's why, he wanted me to be an agricultural officer. You will be one. You know what? - What? Dad told me to plant all the trees in our house. Really? - Yes. He used to tell me, the plants planted by me used to live. Really? So, 10 plants will surely live. Can I come in? - Hey! Uncle! What is up? How are you? Isn't dad at home? - He went to the district. Do you need anything? - It's urgent. Really? Wait for two minutes. Speak, when I pause. He has to... What is it? You're huge as a horse! Such losers! Sir... - You can't do anything right. Vice... - Right? Yes! You have a useless mentality! What are you doing? Sir... What's going on with you? - Vice... Dad brought this horse, since he loved it. Right? Back then, the water flowed out of his mouth. Now, everything is choked up. Who did this? Who is to blame? - Sir... Listen to me! - Sorry, If this doesn't have water flowing by tonight, you'll be in hot water. Come on! Get out of here. Run. Talk to me! - I... It will be decided who Rupali will marry. But, you see... ...your dad has the papers for the land. If I could get them back, then... ...l would set you up with Rupali. Uncle, you're my uncle. Forget about the land, uncle. It's all yours. - Right. I'll give you the papers. Come on. What's for dinner? - Uncle Wait right here. I'll get them. - Okay. No! Eww! - Bajya, watch this! That's the latest tussle video! No! - They're not going to stop, since you said so. Bajya, how will you manage after the wedding? Why can't they behave like humans? Forget about being human! He's the tailor and he's taking her measurement. Is that Suraj? No, he's a different guy. - Yes. Not him! Look there. - What? Wasn't that Rupali? Why is Suraj with Rupali? Forget it! How do we care? Are you crazy? - Yes. Hey, call up Point. - Sure. Uncle! - Hey! The documents. - Yes. Uncle, listen to me. If I give you these documents... Yes. ...what's the guarantee you will marry her to me'? If you don't trust me, forget about it. It's okay. I don't care. Forget it. But, you see... ...l haven't told her that you're already married. Right? My wife doesn't live with me. I sent her to her maternal home, long back! Uncle! But, I don't understand why Rupali would marry married man. The others are marrying for the first time. Right? Besides, if it is so tough, Rupali can marry someone else. I don't care. Here. I'm leaving. No, uncle! Here, take this. Take it. Are you sure? - It's your farm. Decided? - Take it. Rupali is mine. Okay? I'll leave now, Bharat Rao. Don't worry! I'm here. What is it? - I came to take the birth date verification. Kishan! Why are you lying? What do you mean? - We know you. What? - You rascal! You're going to take everything from us... ...and marry Rupali to Suraj, right? What are you saying? How is that possible? Hey! We saw them together. We did, vice chief. Rupali was clinging to him. Right, Bajya? Well, actually, she wasn't really clinging... ...you know, the way girls sit? Like that? See? Bajya, be quiet We saw it. Bharat Rae. - Yes. She was clinging to him. - Yes! What are they saying? Rupali and Suraj took classes together in Pune. That's how they know each other. It's true. It's nothing else. If there anything, you will be ruined. You won't be able to live in this village, okay? What? - Sir, the horse is giving off water. What is it's problem? See, that's him. Suraj Chothe. So, you're having fun with Rupali. Who are you? - Well wishers. There is no match between the two of you. We'll figure that out. Listen, you have to know your place. You won't decide my place. Give back my key. I won't give it back to you. Use the razor, give your mouth a rest. Come on, clean my pits. Or do you want to clean something else? You rascal! Hey! We are so scared! Are you going to grab us by the collar, now? Lower your hand. Lower your gaze. My name is Rupali. You... Let me go! Stop! You can't run away! I will find you, some day! Grandma! Rakmai is back! Rupali said, that the one who did this... ...until she knows who among you hit Suraj... ...she won't discuss marriage. Okay? So, whoever did this, just go and confess to her. But, we didn't do anything. - We didn't. Neither did I! I swear by Bingaroo! Don't look at me! I am innocent! That vice chief must have done this. Hey! - Sit! - Go on. I am sure, he thought of this political ploy. - Yes. you're fight. Yes. - So, Bharat Rao? I have become the scapegoat though I didn't do anything! Anyway, but if Rupali thinks I hit Suraj... ...what can be done? I'll deal with this. A heart wrenching incident has occurred in our village. It's heart rending. Our friend, Suraj Prabhakar Rao Chothe... ...was beaten up. An unknown person hit him. Shame on us! We should bow our heads in shame! Bow your head, you! Listen to me, please. It's not all that bad. Let's end this, here. - Hey! There's no issue! Let's have a selfie. Let's show our reverence to this selfie. Hey! Come here. - Yes. They really like taking selfies. So, this incident has made me... What is he saying? Stop it! I won't spare him! - Let go of the mic! You'll mess up. What is it? Hello, folks! - Hello. Our village has never believed in casteism. It won't, even in the future. What has the respected Shahu Phule Ambedkar said? Vice chief, that's three different men who are equally great. Yes, the three of them said one thing in common! Applause! - Applaud! ' Applause. Everyone, come together. Everyone come together and... what are they doing? Listen, everybody! - What are you doing? Hail Bharat Rao! - Where are you taking me? Hail Bharat Rao! - Hey! Hail Bharat Rao! - Listen to me. Ha Bharat Rad. - Let me speak! What is it? Are you going to keep walking or will you talk? Well, Rupali says that... ...she still doesn't trust anyone of you. Listen to me. Should I serve dinner? Sure, bring it, right away. Serve me at once! - No! Uncle. Get up, now. We have to say something to them. Come with me. Rupali says, that she doesn't know any one of you. Can I leave? - How is that possible? We chatted so much that day? Right? It's not like that. - Then what? She knows your name, but she doesn't know you as people. What is the problem with us? - That's the problem with you. I have an idea. Earlier, they used to have groom selection ceremonies. Princes from every village used to come and present their skill. Then, if the princess liked one of them... ...she used to say... Dad! I want this guy! Then, the chosen prince would marry the princess. Now, we have a real life princess here. But, none of you looks like a prince from any angle. And skills? None of you has a shred of sense. Uncle Kishan, right here... Just name it. You're a loser, Bharat Rao! So, we're going to do something fun. We will have a show and tell program. What? - Yes. I have a whatsapp group, called Rupali's groom selection. Let me tell you. - Okay! I'll update the rest of the details on that, okay? Get to work. Be quick. - Yes, sure. Who's on the group? - The five of you and me. Change the admin, boss. Take it or leave it! Listen to me! The most impressive man will be chosen by Rupali. Oh! - Rupali. My dad won't listen. He says, do whatever it takes to do something to Rupali. Impress her. - Yes, that's it! What does that mean? Is it pressing hard, like this'? Suraj! Tell me, what does Rupali like? Does she like fruit? Blackberries. - What? I'm so in love with her! - Yes! Me too! Eyes like Deepika Padukone! Lips like Katarina! Ayesha Takia's... - What? Hands. - What on earth? Will this make me really fair? - Yes. Let's have a selfie of me getting steam. No, why? - Come on! Here we go. That's a vast difference. Yes, it is. I need to do more of that, you know? What do you mean? - You know! Press! Impress. - Yes. Does she like flowers? Yes, she really like Mahatma Phule! Thank God, you didn't say Nilu Phule! Hey, I mean flower. - What? Flower! She really likes roses. Come in. Sit. Why is everything filled with roses? Kishan said, you have to be impressed, right? That's the point here. One for the rose. Let's have a selfie. Okay? Go on. Can I take it? Hey! What is it? They keep playing. That's why it's getting messed up. So, Bharat Rae'? What do you do? What should I do? - I mean, for a living? I'm the vice chief of council. I don't need to do anything. My goal is the progress of the village. But, you're the vice chief thanks to your dad. - Yes. What do you do? There's the megacity project. There are plots for sale. It's raining money. Growth oriented. - What? Great! - Yes! You have a huge house. - Yes. But, it's just you and your dad in this huge house, right? Yes. My mom died, when I was a kid. Dad didn't marry again. He took care of things, outside the house. I've been raised by all and sundry. But, that's not an issue here. And, what about your wife? My wife? Where? Which, whose wife? That's not an issue. - Yes, it is. You sent her back home, didn't you? Who told you? I bet Kishan told you. God... - Why does he have to tell me? If I have to marry you... ...Im bound to find out all about you. Yes. You need to. Actually, she couldn't have a son. It was girls, both times! After we got rid of them, it was a girl, again the third time! The doctor said, her life is in danger. I said, no way. I sent her back home, as she was. So, let's assume that we get married in future... and I have a daughter, you'll send me back, too? We are going to have a son. RUpali! Here he is. - How long is this going to take? Is this working? How long will you keep talking? Disauction. - Here, take that. What is that'? - Gulabjamuns (sweets). You love them, right? Bajrang! It's your room, right? Why are you standing out? Come in. Sit. What is it? I won't eat you up! Here, Nshan Rae. It's fresh puff pastry. - Just take one. I'll take another. - Let him have more. You know, this is our home. - Have some. We are doing really well. Your daughter will be happy. Don't worry. She will become so fat, she won't be able to bend after 2 months. That's my wife! Right'? Are they the neighbours' kids'? - Sister-in-law! No way! They are my kids. Once Bajrang has kids, he will have kids. Then the uncles and nephews will go to school, together. Right, Pappu? Oh, dear! He soiled my clothes. Listen, dear! What is it'? - Look at that! Here! - What is it, Pappu? Oh, my! Let me take him, dear. Don't you use diapers? - We do! But my younger one is a total scamp. He can't do anything, when he has the diaper on. But, the older guy are really smart! When something of the sort is about to happen... ...he stands in front of me... ...and makes a face like this. So, you can guess that work is in progress or almost done. It's the same with our boy Bajrang, too! - What? What? - Yes! What is your problem? Well, actually, I... ...don't know how to tell you. - Just tell me! I mean, actually... ...actually, you Know... ...after the wedding, when the man and wife... ...you know, what they do! It feels really creepy to me. I mean, is that all they share? It's not like that, but... ...a marriage is incomplete without that. And it becomes meaningless, too. All of that is equally important. But, to what extent'? Isn't there any limit to it'? My dad is so old and still he has kids! He's always got that on his mind, 24!?! Have you seen how red his nose is? He got married, within a year after my mom died. She's my aunt! It was the same thing with her, too. Constantly! I feel sorry for her. I felt sorry for my mom, too, but... I felt really bad for my mom. But, what... no! Well... Bajrang, don't cry. Bajrang! Don't cry! Come on, don't cry! Forget about dad. Think of yourself. Do you realise what a hunk you are? If you were in our college, the girls would swoon over you. You know, if something scares you... ...confront it, directly. For example, if you see a woman... ...look at her directly. - What? And just grin at her. - What? I mean, smile openly, nicely! Okay? See, it's happening! Grin! Just like that. What is it? - NO, I... We've made tea after so long! Normally, it's every other brand. Don't forget Smirnoff! - Yes, that too! But, our Arjun is a good boy. He loves liquor. No matter how drunk he is, he can carry it. He doesn't stagger around. And he eats so neatly! Whereas, my husband? What is it? - He calls Arjun, Ajrun! He may fall! - I'm so doomed! He's fallen down! - Hey! Blackberries? Do you sell these, too? No. We sell blackberry liquor. I know, you like blackberries. Yes. - Yes! What's that for? - To spit out the seeds! I won't eat so much! - Go ahead! Eat up! Once you like something, finish it off! That's why, I finish 8 bottles every day. 8? Growth oriented. I'm not an ordinary man. But, I have a thought. - What? You set up a liquor store. Why not start a Chemist's shop? What a thought! Awesome. Tell me, who drinks medicine every day? Does anyone do that? No, they don't! But, one drinks liquor every day. We're running a first class service industry, here! Wow! I love the way you think. The highest mentality! - Yes. An agricultural officer? Amazing. But, after she marries our son, why must she do that? - What? Suresh will give her whatever she wants. Hey, isn't Ramesh our son, too? - What? She's here. - Come on. Why are you wearing sunglasses at home? Because you like this. - Oh, no. That's not true. - It isn't? Take them off. - No! - No! Take them off. - No! - It's okay. Oh, my! What happened? We got it beached. - It's got an L. Blee... We got it leached. Ouch! Hard work. We have a brick kiln, you know. We were tossing the bricks in when the flames hit us in the face. So, the hair turned golden. - Right. You look like Angry Birds! One moment, you were to the registrar's office, right? Your tongue is purple. - What? No. That's not what happened. Pani puri (street food)? You like it, right? - I do. That's why, we got it specially for you. - Yes. The water is a gift from me. And I've sponsored the puris. It was such fun! I wish, aunt were here. - Aunt. She'd see how important girls are. Forget it. Don't rake up the past. They were such buffoons! They are not buffoons, they are monkeys. Their dads are even worse than they are. Each one is more priceless than the other! So, he's talking about marrying Rupali. They're not all that bad. I mean, they need to grow up a bit, but they'll do. And Bajrang? You should have seen him grin! I really like him. What? Are you really going to get married? What will she do, after marriage? - They can do farming. Farming? Do groundnuts grow above the ground or below? I bet those monkeys don't even know that! They want to farm, it seems! What are they talking about? Hey! Wait a minute. Wait. Can you swim? - Sure! I use a pumpkin as a float. Should I push you in? - No, please! Didn't you come to hit Suraj the other day? - No. NO? - No! Tell me, or... - Please don't hit me! I hit him. Who sent you? I can't tell you that. Tell me who sent you! Kishan sent me. Uncle. - What? Uncle! - What? What is it? - I'll go and check. I didn't know you would stoop so low. What is the matter? Ask him! - What? What is it? You sent men to hit Suraj, right? What is this? Who told you? - That doesn't matter. Yes or not? I didn't send them to thrash him. I just... Forget about it. I won't listen to anything. I've lost my regard for you. - What? What... But... Listen to me, dear. Let me bathe at least. Why ask me about lunch, now? It's not about lunch! - What is it about? Rupali isn't at home. What do you mean? Look properly. No, I checked and I can't find her. You can't find her? - No. What do you mean? How can she just go off? Listen! One moment. - Roopali! Listen! - What is this? Rupali! Kishan! - She must be here. I'll tell her. Rupali! She's not there. We checked. You should have checked, before cooking. Listen! - Where is my phone? It's over there. - It's there. Wait. Hello? Listen! - No. - Well... One moment, I'll check on her. - Where are you going like that? Where are you going like that? - Yes! One moment. Where are my clothes? - Inside. Where is my shirt? And my trousers? - Listen, why... Prabhakar. - Hey! Have you seen Rupali since morning? - No. Where is Suraj? - He went out in the morning. Where did he go? - He didn't tell me that. I hope they didn't elope together. How can you jump to these wild conclusions at once? Our kids aren't so crazy. Prabhakar, my reputation is at risk here. You have it easy! Kishan! Hello, vice chief? He should be beaten up! Slacker! Loser! Sarpanch, this is not right. - Yes. You decree his punishment. - That's right. You are hereby ocstracised by the village. Forget about getting the land. Let's see how you will live here. - We'll see. No, don't do that! That's not his fault. I won't allow you to enter my house! Do whatever you want, to me. But, don't treat him like this. It's really not his fault. We know whose fault it is. - Be quiet, you! Your son eloped with Rupali and married her. Come on, let's go. - Come on, Ramya. Oh, God! They are together. Strange! You rascal! - No! You were trying to elope with her! - Wait! Wait! Wait. - You rascal! Let him go! Do you think, we got married? - Of course! How can we get married, just like that? We are from different castes, aren't we? So, you're not married? No. Oh, God! - They're not married! You're not married? - They're not married! They're not married! - They are not! They aren't married. - Yes. They didn't get married. - Take the fridge back inside. Come on, dad! - Put it back! Take the buffalo back in. Put the shorts on. On the buffalo? - You'll get slapped! Put it on the line. Hey, come on. - Uncle, I was mistaken. Rupali, I was mistaken. You can hit me. Go ahead. - No, it's okay. Hit me, I said! - It's okay! Go ahead, hit him since he's asking for it. Go ahead and hit him! - That's alright. Alright, fine. Hey, Bajya! You hit me. Go on! Bajya, hit him, since he wants it! Go on. - Really? Dad! Bajya! You really let him have it. Kishan Rao, let's make it a done deal. - Yes. Anyways, one of these five boys will get the contract. Yes. - Isn't that so? Hey! Hold on to him. - Dad! Listen, Kishan, I will give back your land. - Yes. On top of that, I'll give you another 50 acres, okay? I'll give 50 tolas of gold and 500,000 in cash. - That's nice. Just because you're doing it, don't assume we can't do this. Kishan Rao, how about 7 tolas of gold and 1 million? - What? Dad! - Speak up! One moment. - What? Are you going to give all that? Of course. - Hey! Kishan! - He's over there. Hey, Kishan. - Yes. I will give you all that. - What? I will take it from them and give it to you. - What? What's going on? ls this an auction? I will decide who I marry, okay? - What? - What? Nobody else will do that. Suraj, get your bag out. What is in that? This is the soil from our village. Suraj and I went to Pune to test this soil. The detailed reports of the soil say that... ...this soil can yield a good harvest... ...even with less water, with the help of modern technologies. That's why, you are going to farm, now. - What? What? - Farming? That's your test. What is it? - That is amazing. Farming today, and swimming races, tomorrow! You'll want to test more private stuff, later. - Hey Such as racing. - What? Alright, then tomorrow we will... - What did he say? I said... - Catching cook! Kishan, what's with all this new fangled stuff? It's not new. It's old style. Actually, you like everything to be easy. You don't want any responsibilities! If your wife can't have a kid, send her back home. If a girl is to be born, get rid of her. And if she's born, by mistake, abandon her! It's not the wife's fault, she can't have a son. The gender of the child depends on the man. What? - Did you hear that? Basically, how is it a sin to be a girl? What about the land? There's no harvest, so sell it off. So, basically find an escape route. - Just stop it. If you can't manage anything else, hang yourself or consume poison. So, why haven't I heard of a farmer's wife killing herself? Have you ever thought of how she manages in future? How does she raise her kids? You don't respect the women or the land? Surya, what is respect? Love. - Be quiet! They are talking nonsense! - What? Listen, girl! There is no farming, these days It's not only the land that can harvest a crop. How will it work out if you don't work hard for it? Stop it! You've said enough. That's too much. City folks can come here and talk, very easily. We are listening to her, too. Listen, you plant plants in a pot, don't you? So you think, you can farm, too. It's easy to say it. There is no rain or water here. If it rains, it's hail! How do we farm with that? The fertilizer is expensive, the seeds are expensive. Even consuming poison is expensive. But, how does the government care? They declare packages worth millions. What does the farmer get out of that? A 200 rupees cheque. How much? 200 rupees! What about Panda? How much did he get paid? 45 rupees. 45 rupees as a compensatory cheque! That's why, he strung himself up from a tree. If you can't manage, hang yourself or have poison. Easy to say! Lady, farmers don't like to kill themselves, okay? Actually, a farmer has no value in this country. A farmer is a zero! A big zero! Girls like you will marry a peon. But, no one wants a farmer. I would marry one. I would love to marry a farmer. Get lost, it's easy say to say the words. I'm the only eligible girl in the village, today. Who did that? How did it happen? Because you killed women. You won't have food to eat, if you give up farming. What will we eat, then? Sand and bricks? That's it. I've decided. I will marry the man who is a farmer. That's enough! I've had enough of this charade. Get going. Come on! - There they all go! - Let's go! I knew this would happen. How can they do farming? I'm willing to do farming. Hey! You're ready and that's most of the job done. Come on, let's get married, then. NO! - What? What? - What are you saying? We will do farming, too. He spoke first! - He did! He spoke later! - No. I am ready, too. - What? Oh, no! - Hold him! Don't you want to eat? Sure, I'll serve at once. - Let's go. No! Why? - We can eat after some time. What is the matter? What is the matter? What have you done, how? What is it, now? Now, you will have to marry one of them, now. You should have asked us, before deciding. - Yes! Did you ask me? Before you sent men to hit Suraj? I didn't send them to hit Suraj. Then, what? I sent them to scare him. Why? Why don't you just wait? The boys thought, you were involved with Suraj. I had to do that to placate them. What the heck! You actually hit them. I had settled on 5000 and had to pay 10,000. One of them even had a fracture. Uncle. In future, don't do anything without asking me. You too! We can teach them a lesson if we are on one team. Listen, don't divide up teams. What do we do, if she has to marry one of them? If one of them really farms, I will marry him. But... - What do you mean? - Are you crazy? You will get the land and I will get what I want. On, God. Whose team is she on, exactly? So, these are your five sections. What's with the hut out there? Those are tents for you to live in. For the next three months, you will live here. What? Yes! Live here, eat and drink here and do everything else here. That's good. We can drink here. - Hey. No, no more of that. You have to give up your vices. What? Do you see that board? - Yes. Your scores will be written up there. If anyone cheats, you will lose marks. Uncle is the umpire. When should we start the farming IPL? It's not the IPL. It's Big Boss! - Yes, right. Live in there. So far, no, right away. Within three months, you will harvest the bellpeppers. Come on, get to work. - Okay. - Yes. All the best. - That's okay. We'll meet up, soon. Right? Let's do this. - Yes. Suraj! - What? What crop did she say? Something like bull paper... No, it's bellpepper. - Bull? - Yes! That capsicum with a variety of colours. - Right. Yes. - That's it. Do you understand? - Hey! Multi-coloured. Capsicum! - It's a pepper. Nobody understands a thing. They are all losers. Surya, we will plough it, when the vice chief is done. Right? - It's his tractor, after all. Hey, what's holding you up? What is it? - Come on! Get going. Hey! What? Are you dancing? Hey, stop that. Bharat Rao, what's going on here? Farming. We are ploughing the field. What did we decide? You will farm. Not the labourers. The labourers are mine. - Send them home. Go on. Hey, all of you, get going. What? Bharat Rao, we are going to grow a modern crop... ...with the traditional farming methods. What do you mean? - I mean, use the plough. Get it? - What'? What about this tractor? Can you drive it? - Yes. Then, don't drive it. I'll drive it. Bharat Rae, thank you. See you. Take it to my house, safely. Nothing. You're a loser. Where will we find a plough? Suresh! - What? Will you take the plough? Your tummy is jutting out. Hey, Kishan has a plough. Really? - Yes. Hey, Kishan! Respected uncle Kishan! You have a plough, right? - I used to have one. It broke. It's broken, is it? Keep it going! I'm going to minus points on the first day. What? - You can sit up there and scream. Hey, losers! What on earth! 20! This stress due to farming is just too much. Hey Surya, any froth? - Be quiet. Where are the bullocks? - They will be here. Take a selfie. Keep the pail out of it. Here's the bullock! Put that down. - What? Oh, no! - Just one? Brother, where's the other bullock? He's not in the mood. - What? Since when do bullocks have to be in the mood? I mean, he said no. He's got a blister on the underbelly. How will we get another bullock? - You bet! How can we plough the field with one bullock? We will another bullock, right? Right, Bajya! - Yes. We have the bullock, right? - Yes. That's what I am talking about. Sahebrao, move on. - Come on! He's holding on to that. Won't he walk? - Come on, walk. Come on! It's a request. Sahebrao, please walk a bit. It would be a great help. Who named him Sahebrao? - Go and ask his mom! Sahebrao won't move. - Please, move. Sahebrao, I bet you have a mate. - Yes. We don't have anyone, yet. - Yes. We have grown up on videos. Sahebrao, what's your problem? Where is the whip? Bring it. I'll whip him twice and he'll move it. Bharat Rao, don't do that. I'll talk to him. Sahebrao! Please walk a little. You know, it would be a great help. We can stop, whenever you are tired. Yes, I'll get you a silk garment during the festival, this year. He's walking! - He's moving! Surya! He's walking! - He's walking! Come on, Bajya, move it. Come on! Bajya, pull with him! He's moving. Yeah! - I'll give him a new garment! Hey, Bajya. Bharat Rao watch it. Blow that fire. Go on, do it! Ramya, rub my neck on that spot. Watch it. Give me the one that is ready. - Here, take that. Take this. That's Afghanistan. The next map is coming up. Surya, I want England! What do you want? Just eat what you've been given! Or you won't even get that. I'm getting scorched here. Bajya. Eat up. Eat well. Bajya, eat as much as you want. Thanks to you, we ploughed our field! Eat up. I got you lollipops. Your favourite, right? Eat up. Eat up. - Eat them with the flatbreads. Yes. Eat up. What is it? - What? No. - Oh, it's you? What's the matter? - I'll be right back. Here, take some. You eat it, too. I can't eat without you. So, what's going on, Bajya? I'm feeding Sahebrao. He doesn't eat at any odd time. - What? Surya! - What are you doing here? I'll give it. - Give it, please. It's the tenth day! When will you sovv the seeds? Hey, Pint! Why are you slouching around here? I gave you seeds for all, yesterday. Did you distribute them? Oh, no! I forget. - What the heck? I'll get them. - He forgot the seeds. He's a farmer, alright! No. I'll get minus ten points. Done, done, done. You got it? - Here are five seal packed packets. Vice Chief, here's your share. Here, take this. - Yes! Okay, we've divided these up. We start sowing seeds tomorrow. Yes. - Yes. You'll start sowing seeds from tomorrow? - Yes. Well done. How will you do that? What about the water? Bharat Rae has a we nearby. - Yes. We'll set up a pump and get the water out! - Yes! That's not an issue. See, the contest has begun. - Yes. The callpettion. - What? So, I won't give my well water to anyone. Hey! But, how can you say that? Where should we get the water from? Yes? - Anywhere you want! I don't care. That's right. Oh, that's great! I ploughed the field. Wasn't it a call... ...a contest, then? - Yes, tell him. Bajya! My innocent Bajya! What is your problem? I'll give you the well water. I will figure it out, for myself. Yes. - Right. You'll see. You can manage your water. That's a problem with Western Maharashtra. You never know when someone will pinch your water. Good night! Come on, boys! - Pint! Come on, the day has begun. - Pint! Where did he go? What's the matter with him? - You rascal! Pint! - Bharat Rao! He's over there. - Come here. What is it? - Here you are. What is it'? What is it'? - What is the matter? You gave me bad seeds to get me out! Bharat Rao! - You rascal! Let me go! - Let him go! I'll kill you! - Bharat Rao! Why are you hitting me? It was a sealed bag! How would I know? What did I do? What do you mean? Do you think I am crazy? I am not an infant, okay? You gave me rotten seed, you have had it! Ramesh, let me go! - I won't let go! You can't talk to me like that! Let me go! Let me go! - What is going on here? A friendly tussle? Arjun, did you give them rotten seed? What is the point of that? The contest is about to come to a standstill here. If Rupali finds out, you may forfeit the contest. How can that happen? What have we done? You bet! We can't blamed for something we didn't do. - Right. No, listen. We still have four parts. Let's divide that in five parts. But, let's not fight each other. That's okay. Big deal! Agree, Bharat Rao, we will divide it into 5 parts. No! Why? I don't want it, anyway. Hey, Pint! My image has been ruined! Take it all! I'm leaving the contest. Listen, he's leaving. Let's share the four parts. No. - We can't do that. He's sulking. - Yes. Say sorry to him. - Yes. I say sorry? I won't. - Yes. So, I will call Rupali and tell her... ...that the contest is off. - No! - Mr. Kishan! One moment. Say sorry, rather than getting out of the contest. He's angry and so he is in a powerful place. - Yes. If you want me to marry Rupali, let's do this. Yes. That's not going to happen. Hey! You rascal! What is the point of this? Why are you sulking like a girl? God! What is your problem? Listen, the angry man needs an apology! Sorry. Right? Hey! If you give me your seeds... ...l will give you my well water. What? - What! - What? It's our team. Right? So, people? - Water the field. Rupali is here! - She is here. How far have you reached? We sowed the seeds. Have you seen that? What have you done here? What? - We sowed the seeds. It will be done, once we water it. - Right. Well clone. - You have to sovv a single seed. What do you mean? - Don't you get it? Should I tell you about everything? Use your mind and get some information. We don't know. You tell us, we'll listen to you. So, that's nice. She gives the questions and provides the answers, too! This is all wasted. You bet. - Let's go! - It's wasted? It's like putting donkeys on a bomb disposal unit. - Of course. They can't do farming. - No way. Farming isn't easy. - No. They have never farmed. - Oh, no! So, we have to do it all over again! How would we know? Where should we get the information? Who can we ask, now? We don't know anyone... Uncle Zumbar! I told you, I won't get involved in your wedding. That's not the issue. Uncle, we aren't here for that. - Then, what is it? We need something else. - Yes. We are all farming, currently. - Yes. Which means all of you are sitting idle. What on earth, you... - Bharat Rao, stop it. We are really farming. We are growing to harvest bell peppers. - What? You don't know anything. - Wait a bit. Multicoloured capsicums. And we need your back direction for that. - What? What did he say? - He said, be our guide. Oh, right. - That's it. So, the boys are finally on the right track. First, make three foot beds of the soil. Farming isn't easy. You have to sweat it out. Next, spread the plastic and sow the seeds at one foot distance. This crop need less water. So, water it sparingly. Okay? Wow! You're really working. - Hey, it's Rupali! Right'? - You have to be careful, the next few days. We are working hard. - We will take care. - Yes. Hey Pint! - What? How about a drink? No, thanks. - No? It feels really good, without it. Did you ever imagine you would do something like this? You sleep blissfully, after working. And it makes you hungry, too. Earlier, we used to eat, since it was time to eat. Now, we eat since we are hungry. This is all because of Rupali. That's true, Surya. A woman is very important in one's life. - Yes. I mean, you need a woman besides your mom in life. - Yes. Someone to understand you. She explains sensible stuff to you. - Yes. That's why, a wife is really important. Bharat Rae? - What? What are you thinking about? Hey, look! If you link up the stars... ...it forms a bow! - Yes, it does. No, silly. - What? Look closer. It's a plough! A plough? - A plough. Oh, really, it is! - Bajya! You're right! What's up, folks? - Bandit! Uncle! You're taking it easy. Rupali is giving her exams and you're taking a holiday! Once the peppers grow, you're done. Right. - Yes. Will you come along? - Where? There is a dance program in the village nearby. Dance? No, forget it. We promised Rupali. - Yes. We won't have any vices, till we finish farming. That's right. Really? - Yes. They say a very beautiful woman is going to be dancing. Really? - What? Forget it. You promised. Don't break it. Go on, sleep with your cameras, then. But, she is fabulous. Ta da! - Fabulous? The woman... "Your seeds are no good." "It's messed up everything." "Your seeds are no good." "It's messed up everything." "My land is high quality... ...don't get too attached." "My land is high quality... ...don't get too attached." "Her land is high quality... ...why are you getting attached?" "You sow spicy chilies... "You put a pump on an empty well... ...and that's your hybrid Charade." "You brag a lot... "You brag a lot, but you can't match up!" "My land is high quality... ...don't get attached to it." "Her land is high quality... ...don't get too attached to it." "Your crazy heart is a fluttering bird... ...is pining away for someone." "Why are you depriving yourself?" "Why don't you feed?" "There is talk about harvest... "There is talk of harvest in the resplendent fields." "The fields are daringly open." "My land is high quality,.. ...don't get too attached." "My land is high quality... ...don't get too attached." "Her land is high quality... ...don't get too attached." "Her land is high quality... ...don't get too attached." What is it? - Why are you looking behind? They are all gone. My name is Sangeeta. What's your name? Oh, my! So, folks! What's up with the farming? Right, Surya? Ramya? You used to laugh at me! Let's talk, now. Show me whatever you want. Bring anyone in front of me. I won't be scared, even if you bring all of Sunny Leone! You know, what's happened to me? Experience is the best teacher, if you ask me! Hey, what is up with all of you? Why are all of you grimacing so unhappily? Bajya, the crop is infested. - What? Forget the crops and the wedding. We can't do anything, except moan, now. What happened overnight? We lost it! Rupali knew this soil won't yield a harvest of this. That's why, she made us choose this crop. She didn't want to marry us. Here you are. Ramya, take this. - What is this? Bajya! - It's all ruined. Bharat Rao, take this. Cheers! What are you doing? We promised. Forget the promise! - Yes. Here, you drink it too. We're ruined, anyway. Here, drink this. You drink this, too! I'll make sure they are all drunk! Drink up! Farming was such a waste of time! Hey! See, what has happened! Our plants are better! Oh, no! They perked up like me after the drink! Hey! The crop is safe! Surya, Ramya! Bajya! Bharat Rao! The crop is safe! The farm looks so amazing! Yes, that's right. But, what is that smell? - You can smell it too? The fine quality peppers have an odour. - I see. Yes. - Yes! Really? I've a BSc in Agriculture. I studied all this. Tell me, what is that smell? It's liquor. Did you drink? He got drunk! - We didn't. Besides, he put some in the crops, too. - What? No, actually, the crops were diseased. - Okay. And, in the chaos, I ended up giving the plants liquor. They were cured. - Yes. Yes. That's when I sprayed liquor on all the plants. Which is why I deducted 5 marks each. Erase that. What? They have got it! See! Basically, you used your minds... ...and used things around you to sort problems out. And that worked! You bet! I have been saying that liquor is important. Are you done? Don't fly so high. No! - Okay, don't do that again. There's another thing. - Yes? See, how and where you can sell these. Yes! - This is export quality crop. That's why, you get the day off! - What? Go home and rest. Look, we have here in this field... ...multicoloured bellpeppers grown by us. Yes. Look at this! It's so plump! Alright, I'll come and survey it in two days. Oh, wow! He's Marathi! Hello, I'm Bharat Rao Zende, the vice chief of Tekawade. But, it doesn't belong only to me. - What? You have to buy all our crops. - Yes. I will buy it, if it is a good crop. See you, then. So, you can use the iPad for other stuff! You bet! All you did was watch tussling videos, so far. Come on, it's time to go home. - Yes. Yes, let's go, Bajya. - Yes. No, you can carry on. I will follow. What is your problem? You're such a loser! Come on! - Let's go. Come on! Come on, let's go. - Let's go. It's done. - Put the peppers back. Here's the special pepper. - Hold that. Uncle, both of us have passed! - What? What? You passed? Great! Congratulations, my super talented child! Mangal, get some sugar. - Mom! Wow! Wonderful! She's an agricultural officer. Make some semolina pudding. - Yes. Take it easy. - Wow! - Make some tea, too. You're officers, now. - Bajya. - Bajya. Bharat rao, it began to rain. Pint! Pint! - Bajya! Our crops! This place is flooded with water! Actually, I broke down the border around the crops and the water drained out. Bajya, it's stopped raining! It's stopped raining. Has it stopped raining? - Yes. Bajya, we are saved, thanks to you. Hey! - Bajya! Bajya! I hope, you didn't lose anything much. Is everything alright? Thank you, Rupali. Honestly, thank you. Why are you thanking me? Today, you have made us realise... ...what it means, to have a mother. So, you must have realised... ...what happens to a mother, when her baby is killed before her. The losers of the past are heroes now. These young men of Tekawade have found a new ideal for themselves. They produced export quality bell peppers... - Hey, Kishan! And made 300,000 each as profit. They will name their pepper, Rupali Pepper. Hey, Kishan, what about the wedding? The wedding is off the charts! - What? Everyone has the same output. What? - How is that possible? We have decided to have the wedding, right? So what? How does that decision matter? She can't marry five people at one time. Hey, Kishan! We are okay with that. - Yes! - What? It will do. Let's make it a done deal. Okay? - Yes. Let's make it a done deal. - Yes. Kishan, it's done! It's done! Rupali, here are the documents for our land. I have them, today. But, in return for what? Rupali, leave. - Yes! Honestly, just go. Or these wolves won't spare you. Suraj and you can elope and get married. Go away somewhere. Really. - What? I mean... ...at first, even I had the whole caste issue in mind. I sent people to bash him up. But... ...he's the most deserving boy, for you. There is something apart from caste, when it comes to love. Basically, a person's capability matters most of all. Rupali, you can leave. I'm being honest. - No! No, uncle. I won't run away. - Listen to him. Who are you, dear? What is your name? Rukmini. Rukmini? - Rukmini Bharat Rao Zende. Bharat Rao? - She is my daughter. And this is my wife, Lakshmi. I have a lovely wife and child. I am the richest man in the village. I won't marry you. What? Here they are. Come on, tell her about it. Me, first. - Tell her. Sangeeta made me confident. I can't forget about her. Dad isn't agreeing to the wedding. But, I will marry her. Yes, Bajya! Who is Sangeeta? - Who is she? You were giving your exams. - Yes. I went and gave an exam with her. He made it to the stage! Stage? - The dancing stage. They tussled on the night that she performed. Rupali? - Oh, no! - What? That's my age certificate. The real one. - Yes. I can't marry you, legally. - What? I would have, if I could. Let's see when I turn 21. For now, I'll work, make money... ...and date girls. - What? Call her sister. - Yes. Uncle Zumbar had come over. He said, as discussed... ...Seeta and Geeta will marry you. Uncle said, we are progressive sons-in-law of a progressive farmer. L told him, our culture is agriculture. Wow! - Yes. I have a surprise for you. He must be waiting outside. - Yes. Suraj! We went to get my family. He was at the bus stop. He was leaving all of us to go to Pune. I brought him back. Suraj, what's up? Does Rupali like roses? Which fruit does she like? Blackberries? What does she like to eat? - Pani Puri! You know a lot about her. - You bet. He told us all about you. Really? - Yes. What the heck! So, Suraj? Will you marry her? Uncle! - What? I'm here. Yes. But, she has to go for training, first. She has to become an agricultural officer. Then, she can decide. Wow, Suraj! - Wow! That's what I like! - Amazing. First class! There's something else to be done. - Now, what? "Nothing in heaven works without you." "Vithal can't handle the world all by himself." "Nothing in heaven works without you." "Vithal can't handle the world all by himself." "Come along, Rakmai, to the maternal home of the devotee." "Come with shaded steps to Vithal's inner sanctum." "Come along, Rakmai, to the maternal home of the devotee." "Come with shaded steps to Vithal's inner sanctum." "Nothing in heaven works without you." "Vithal can't handle the world all by himself." "You are the mother of all. You are the goodness of all eternity." "Shade us in your loving protection." "You are great. All three realms worship you." "Touching your palanquin, can make a wish come true." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai." "You are the mother of all. You are the goodness of all eternity." "Shade us in your loving protection." "You are great. All three realms worship you." "Touching your palanquin, can make a wish come true." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai." "Rakmai, Rakmai, Rakmai."
