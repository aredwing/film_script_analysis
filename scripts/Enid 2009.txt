I must warn you I can not trust much in this device and I have sometimes Call hearing problems, so I Please refrain in advance. I hope it is the word. "It is, Miss. Blyton? Perfect. Excellent. "I can? It's quite extraordinary, you know. Normally I can not hear one word but with you, everything is crystal clear. You will need to do with the timbre of your voice. Have you ever been ...? No, no, no. Torpedoed I during the war. And yet, I was more fortunate than others. "We took our coffee in the lounge? I'd love to. With your permission. It really is not coffee. Is hot, is brown, and is liquid. And there the similarities end. Chapote not, right? My deadline is chapote. You're not like imagined it would be a writer. I thought all writers were vague and drawn, waiting for his muse. Muses are nonsense. If you want write, you sit down and write. Do they read my books your children? I have none. I've always wanted, but No luck, I fear. ... And your wife? Marriage is not, er ... how can I say ... not happy. But tell me about yourself. Tell me everything. Parents, brothers, sisters, everything. "Husbands? My God, how many you had? Only one. Why? It has not been happy. No. I just do not understand why I left home so young. I suppose that after the father left, could not wait to leave. And then I never wanted to return. I could not face any of them. And your mother? - Dead. - Sorry. You know, for years I thought it was my fault that my father is gone. He thought I should have done something terribly bad. That was a kind of evil, very, very black, inside of me. If not, why march? Of course he will not quit. Left to your mother. I'm sure you wanted with every fiber of your being. Why should I? God had never spoken about it with anyone. Your attitude should be comprehensive. Not because we are ... It was much more fun than I expected. And Kenneth, that lovely surgeon. He is married, Enid. Charming. Thank you. Is Dad? Yes, yes it is. '"Exploring the island!" cried Anne, I was climbing the rocks. " '"Oh, come on Oh, come on!"' 'It was a small natural harbor. Nestled under the tall rocks. " 'The water was like glass, and just had a flaw. " 'George was very happy. " 'He had often visited the island before but always alone, except for Tim. " 'He had always vowed never, ever, would anyone there, ' 'Because that would spoil the island her. But he had not spoiled. " 'It had become much more enjoyable. " Girls! Girls, come here. I want you to know someone. Girls. This is a friend of mom, sr. Waters. He came to dinner. Is not it wonderful? Well? What? - How are you? How are you? - Perhaps nothing of shaking hands. No. - Why do not we teach what you do? - Okay. Yes. - It's wonderful, right? - I did not know, er ... A garden. - Where are you taking me? - Just a site. No, tell me. What do you think? I've rented for six months. And to make sure your reputation remains intact, have hired in a false name. - What fake name? - Well, he left no more than my mouth. I could not help it. Kenneth, what fake name? Dorothy. Dorothy Richards. It is not possible ... is terrible for poor Dorothy. Never know, right? - Father! Father! - Hi, girls. - Where is your mother? - Gone with Uncle Kenneth. - Who? Is the uncle Kenneth? - Yes, Mr. Waters. Your friend. Oh, yeah, yeah. I know him. Him You know him? Your mother said, yes. " - Do you want to come and see our rabbits? - Okay. We had two, but mother and Uncle Kenneth ate another. Oh, it sure is a shame. Hugh. What are you doing here? How did you get? - Technically, I still live here. - Oh. Well, well. Because in reality, I think we need to talk. Girls, with a babysitter. See you soon, girls. Shut the door, Hugh. Oh, by the way, I will send Gillian to school. I think you feel good. - Any objections? - It would have difference that the case? Probably not. Sit down, Hugh. Did you ever stop? No, I do not, Hugh. Because I know what works with children. I know what they want and know what they need. They want something they can trust. And my intention is to provide it. - I do not know how you get to be published. No paper. - I got over that. Six different publishers, six different portions of paper. Simple. Only you, Enid, you could convert a War in a business opportunity. And that kind of commentary, Hugh, is one of the reasons they want a divorce. Divorce? Yes, I want this to end. I want the marriage to end. "Based on what? - Adultery. - That could be risky. Do you think your sales could survive the scandal? "Enid Blyton has a mistress. "Imagine that in the - Front pages - Not my adultery, Hugh. Yours. I know what that girl you've been seeing. And as you say, the damage to my reputation would be too large. - What about my reputation? - You have no reputation. Although, sorry, of course you have it. As drunk. Since I left this house, I just tasted a drop. Why do you think will? I really do not know, and I do not care. Everything I know is I can not ... You are so hypocritical, Enid. How can you be a model of morality well when your fans is how you really are? The sole reason why your fans I love it because you do not know. You're despicable! 'Your father is gone. He does not want to live anymore us, it's gone. " 'Your dad has found another woman, Enid. " - I have a handkerchief. Here you go. - Thanks. Are not you excited? "The first or second day of a quarter are always exciting. " "There is much baggage to undo." "And best of all, there boxes full to empty. " "The twins missed their home and his mother, at first, " "Like most of the girls." "But there was much to do that there was no time to worry. " Maggie? Is anyone in the way. Can you see who it is? I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Sorry, I do not know where to start. So go to the point. I am ... the wife of Kenneth. "Kenneth? This is very difficult for me. You could try to be honest at least. Sorry, I have no idea - You talk. - I know, I know you and him ... .. Which is having a affair with my husband. - Sorry, this is ridiculous. I would like to leave. - I have been together. May I speak low? There's a girl in the house. - I have been with my husband. - Look ... I'm a public figure. I view with many people. Well, how says called this man? I know what house you have rented in Knightsbridge. Oh, dear. Clearly she is very angry. Why not sit a moment? Sit here. I'm sure everything this is a great error. I'll get something to drink. I want it back, okay? How I can help untangle this awful mess? Lady ... Sorry, what was his name? Really, I almost died in the site. What could have possessed? Do not know how he found out what this place. I thought I had taken the papers with me when I moved. Well, thank God you put the name Dorothy, is all I can say. I think I managed convincing. Oh, God! Now think I have a Dorothy Richards adventure! Oh, no. You should think I've gone crazy. That is very cruel. Apparently, it is public knowledge I have an adventure with Kenneth Waters. - You? - We have a love nest in Knightsbridge, apparently. Where the hell may have come from? I have no idea. Very peculiar. Anyway, I love you here, because I have news. Can you guess? Probably sue you for slander. - Do not be absurd. - Do not worry, Enid. I will not. - Of course not. It is as if someone had died, right? No. My News. Hugh and I were divorced for Kenneth and I can marry. - Oh, God. - Are not you happy for us? Can not create the most terrible scandals? And the girls will be devastated! Do not be ridiculous. Gillian is always at school and Imogen is too ... young to understand. But remember how you felt you when your father left. That was an entirely different matter. My father and I were kindred spirits. Hugh has been a father totally useless. Girls do not lie down absolutely less. Oh, for the love of God, Enid, that is absurd! If you want this divorce runs smoothly, have to take into account Hugh's feelings. Of course I'm going to have their feelings into account. Obviously. I'm not a monster, Dorothy. - Do you want another, Gillian? - No, thanks. - What about you? No, thanks. Surely you want another. - No, thanks. - No? Well, then I think we're done. Maggie will call to clean. - Are you having a good birthday? - Yes, thanks, Dad. - Maggie! - Can you come to clean this? - Have you gone back to live here again? Well, it's ... Imogen. Es .. Girls, why not you go out to play in the garden. Yes? Come on, Gillian. Do not be silly, Imogen. Dad has important work to do during the war. You're lucky to have him. Think of those poor children whose parents are fighting far away. Think of the poor children whose parents have died. Now, go, plays with others, and stops mount a number. Okay? Go! You called, ma'am. Very funny, Hugh. I've been thinking. I realized how much mean girls for you so I do not want you to be totally excluded from their lives. Oh, I like that "totally." Very interesting on your part. I will give you unlimited access ... Thanks, Lady Bountiful. .. If you let me sue for adultery. We both want to start again, so get it over with. - And let me see them whenever you want? - Totally. What will be over? Do not just get you in my life in any way? Why would such a thing, Hugh? Because I know you, Enid. C'mon, Hugh. I have no all day. Yes or no? Agreed. Wait. There's something we need to do first. Enid, will you marry me? Yes. Oh! Oh, Hugh.
