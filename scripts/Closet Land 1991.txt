How much time do I have here? What day is today? The next day. One night. I was brought here last night. I think it was last night. Sometimes they seem ... - Two nights or two weeks. - No. They brought it last night. You are in charge. They came to my house when I was in bed. One pointed a gun. The other blindfolded and gagged me. I crawled out of my house. On the way here, I was slapped, I spat ... I stretched hair, I twisted the arms ... squeezed my legs and left me in a narrow room ... was not greater a closet. They had no warrant. I have been denied the right to a lawyer. Why am I here? He says he is a writer children's literature. Do you write anything else? Like what? - Policy, for example. - No. - Do not understand politics. - Okay. It is better to have no ideas to have them halfway. So do not belong to any clandestine group. No. - Are your stories politicized? - I write for children 7 and 8. Well, children are best receptacles propaganda. You can do whatever you want, whenever you play with him. - Who said that? - Bismarck. This is ridiculous. Well ... may have committed failure. It does not happen often but sometimes ... if you go drinking, may err on the street. "The wrong street? My sincerest apologies. You can go. Maybe I should wait formal apology. What is it? Let the boss apologize for our failure. How long will it take? Nothing. Do I have questioned like a criminal ... knowing that I was an apology? This is the procedure. You can never be sure. I insist. I'm already used to. The last time I saw was two years ago, I think. Signed autographs at the bookstore the Third Street ... Sorry. I do not want to talk. Do you think your apology enough? I will file charges, especially against him. What is going to present what against whom? I said that I ... I will denounce him. The other. I have not seen but I know his voice. - How sound like? - A clogged pipe. A man with a voice ... stuck pipe. What did? Does the violation? No. Only has cherished Right? Yes Is rare.

I have a letter of apology! Open up! Better be cherished. Can take a long time before leaving. I have to call my lawyer. What is that? Why was not when he had the chance? You can not call or his attorney, or anyone from the outside. You must trust us. I'm just a piece a powerful mechanism ... you too, but together we seek the truth. The help to the extent they can ... but you support the weight of responsibility. Deliberate deception not be tolerated ... although I find their lies charming. Unintentional errors be treated with kindness ... and must rely on my ration of firmness and kindness. Their hopes should focus to depersonalize this ... and do not see me as an aggressor or suffer as a victim. Remember that the two seek the truth ... and I am your friend in this search ... their philosopher and guide. Learn to fly''...'' Triumph of the Treasury''''... The''green-winged cat''... Highly politicized, right? No, you're right. Are harmless. I already said, is making a mistake. No, this is not possible. Are you infallible? I, personally, no. Surely not looking good. There can not be arrested for nothing. Is it going to invent something to justify my arrest? GROUND CABINETS I have not yet published. Where did you get it? They searched my house, right? - Tell me what's going on. - Why do not you read? It is interesting to hear writers talk about their work. - Hidden Meanings ... - In children's literature ... have to be direct, no hidden meanings. Children are very subtle. My stories are harmless cheerful. There are deeper a cotton candy. Have you destroyed my home? Do not worry. All right. Even cleaned before leaving. And there was some blood in the water. - Do you have your period? - None of your business. It does not. See? It is easier if you answer my questions. Are you in good health? Any problem I should know? Is he medicated? Answer my questions be good girl ... and promise not do it again. Do not tell me it good girl. I keep waiting for the artist talk about their work. About a girl whose mother locked in a closet. The girl begins to fantasize the clothes are his friends. There are wonderful festivals in the closet ... with the girl and her friends ... and becomes a stream in a meadow ... wild strawberries and beautiful flowers. When her mother returns from work ... the rooster sympathetic which is actually a scarf ... tells the girl and her friends cackling. The clothes become to their perches ... and the girl falls silent waiting to take her mother. It is a curious story. Unlike''''The Flying Cow and''The green-winged cat.'' "It was a lonely child? - Did not he have siblings? - No, just my mother and me. But his mother case not long ago. Well, it was not his intention, worked hard ... and had literary gatherings Sundays. Still feel alone Right? I do not trust the lonely people. The eternal spectator of life. Watching. Waiting. - "She was afraid her mother? - No. - We got along. - Well, yes. Was with her when he died last year. - What? - The accused them of not noticing. I did what I asked. All that I could. I've been for you you never were there for me. You never noticed. Ran out of the hospital. - His mother died that night. - I have been watching. Since last year, perhaps earlier. Why? Why have recorded my conversations? I brought by mistake. It is part of a plan. We recorded all conversations hospitals without exception. So we access confessions faults, desires, everything ... Almost everything is sentimental nonsense and destroyed ... but if they are writers, actors and political activists ... never destroyed. Government policy. Now ... tell me ... What did not realize his mother? What did not realize his mother? Do not overdo it. Come on, just been tapped. Do not overdo it. - Others were burned with cigarettes. - Will you do me that? I do not smoke. It will happen. Put your head knees. Cover your ears gently. Better? Do we? Some water, please. If you answer my question. What did not realize his mother? Mothers and daughters always discussed. Then you do not remember or why it was. Do not beat me. Do not worry. It will happen. Let's talk about Earth''cabinet.'' The girl, whom his mother has locked ... imagine that the clothes are now friends and play with them. The rooster tells them sympathetic that his mother is back. Clothes hangers and back to she hopes to remove it. Yes? Yes Why are they locked? I do not know. I had not thought. Think about it now. Perhaps he ate too much cake ... or soiled clothing of his mother. And so the enclosing in a closet. It's a little extreme, right? There are secret meetings in the closet. Clothes do not come to life until they are alone. When the rooster, who is watching ... gives the warning cry, escape. And when the mother returns, there is nothing. The girl is a martyr and the mother is a tyrant. Sympathizes with the girl, because he hates authority. - Do you dislike my interpretation? - No. But it is just that. Interpretation. I can not control what you think of my stories ... there are people who turn with passages from the Bible. Earth''cabinet'' is a simple children's story. Not a single word. Think ... We Skeletons in the closet''.'' Is a hide. The Closet'''' homosexual and intellectual. It's a dark world and secret. As the basement or space under the bed at night. All children's stories have elements of terror. Cruel dragons, wicked witches. I chose everyday objects. A closet instead of a monster. It is the only difference. Children's literature is not politicized ... because children are not. Politics is something big. We know that children live for themselves in the moment. But they can guide within an ideology. They are more receptive to the subtleties ... and is what we tried to with history. - It's subliminal indoctrination. - That's absurd! - Do not support the resistance? - No. - Is not it a clandestine member? - No. I do not know politics. Are we back to us? Do you support our actions for peace? I told I do not understand politics. He believed that non-smokers. This is the first. Who commissioned the story? Where is the man in the closet? Who is the clothing that comes to life? We already have two coats. The kindergarten teacher and physical. Who is the rooster? How do you know when will mom? Is it the government? We have some suspicions. Is not one of those activists against the snuff? Tome. It was not necessary. Know if I'll hurt you. The suspense, no pain, drive her crazy. Has changed.

I confess that my story'' 'Land of cabinets' ... is an allegory of the struggle underground resistance. The protagonist of the story ... The reader is misinformed, whose opinion I modeled. I have represented government authority ... in the character of the mother. The clothes are insurgents. The rooster is an official government.'' - I can not sign. - Why? It's a lie! I will not confess lies and although Doing so ... How do I know which will end there? There will be more. Other lies, right? The girl knew she had lost your chance ... opening the door and exit. Whatever you do the poor girl's wardrobe ... bad man not for drinking. Is so thirsty to drink offered urine. He did what all children do when they are caught. He closed his eyes tightly ... and imagined that escaped from hell. I knew there was light beyond hell ... and elves had left a jar ... fresh dew for her. So I figured ... I was there drinking dew on the clarity ... far from hell. It is estimated that 96.8% Women's ... who prefer black lingerie are prostitutes''cabinet.''

While you can go there only have my bones. - Who lives there? - My friends. A flying cow. The cock nice. The green-winged cat. I've known since childhood. I close my eyes ... I'm going away and they come to me. Floating through the air. Why were you in the closet? A man ... Mom's friend ... breakfasted with us Sundays. I had to hang her coat and his scarf in the closet. And then he ... When I was in the closet hanging his coat ... first occurred. He smiled as if a secret between us. I was five. - Your mother was not much? - No. He did not realize, my poor mother. Dumb. Spinning out. I was too afraid to tell ... I said tongue cut and head. So every Sunday, when he came ... I went to the cupboard ... and you expected. Closed his eyes very strong ... rang the bells ... and my friends came to me. The flying cow. The green-winged cat. He forgot that he had hands under my dress. I wonder ... if known, if you really know ... the strength of his mind. Most people is rendered in a couple of hours ... and you have escaped ... back of a flying cow ... and a cat with wings. It is a strange case and only ... AB234. We go to earth cabinets. It's in the closet of his mother, AB234. It's in the closet of his mother, AB234. It's dark. He sees nothing. It's dark. He sees nothing. But close your eyes, because he hears his footsteps. It's in the closet of his mother, AB234. I know you're a good girl. Only five years. And you're a whore. Dear little girl, sweet, so sweet. I know you like. Only five years. And you're a whore. Dear little girl, sweet, so sweet. Here comes the candle, to enlighten, to burn. Here comes the butcher to cut off your head. You. Screaming. Screaming. Screaming. Do not scream. Never did, even now. A look so wise in some eyes so young. What made you so? A mental illness? Does the putrefaction of the soul? Then, you had no hips. Small ribs, like the bones of a sparrow. Could've broken of a touch stronger. A frightened bird banging on his cage. All so small so perfect. We also bring you my innocence. But when you grow up and you had other lovers ... when you played and you approach them ... I was petrified and think of me. ''Because you have the power and grace ... to look through and behind my mask. On that wet years have lashed ... and see the real face of my soul.'' The true face of my soul. Why? Why? Is that why you brought me here? To finish what you started as a child? You are a dissident, belong the group of those who think. - Speaking of flying pigs ... - Cows. Cows. And green-winged cats, you would have saved ... but we found Earth''cabinet.'' Everything begins again, Is not it? I created the land of cabinets when abused me ... and punishes me after all these years ... to invent earth closets. It takes years going, right? All these intrusions night. Always at night, and detention. Charges meaningless ... and brutality. I did not realize ... or maybe I did not see it. I closed my eyes as in the closet. That woman in the neighborhood ... journalist. A few months ago, he disappeared. Without a trace. We believed all the lies because it made sense. I remember going to eat with my editor. A woman who really I did not know ... which greeted on the street. Missing. Then returned to his mother. A 80-year old, without teeth, an invalid. Searched the house Missing journalist ... while the mother was on the street like garbage ... waiting to be collected. We all go long. I know I do. The old woman looked into my eyes and I looked but did not see. None of us saw. Or maybe we did not realize. As my mother. It is the same. Locking a child in a closet or locking elderly. If you can scare a child can frighten an adult ... and, over time, close your eyes and not cry. I never cried in the closet. And people who do not cry ... going around pretending that all is well ... while its neighbors disappear. Thus become in children ... fearing ill they will be beheaded. And that is what is so scary ... children are so helpless. They are as easy victims. As easy victims. If you say ... it is your last chance. Everything is at stake. Everything. Would you sign? How has a mint? They cut off his tongue and learned to whistle. They learned, why not whistled for you. Today, a small injection. He was a physicist. Look at him. Not a single concern. Not a single thought. Look at his eyes. Completely empty. They're just lies, sign it. What do you care? They are only lies.
