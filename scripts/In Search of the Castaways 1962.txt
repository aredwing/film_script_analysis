Oh, would you now? He'll be horribly hurt to know you didn't arrive for the start of the party. We didn't even know about it. I bring news of one of his ships disappeared at sea. A message from Captain Grant of the Britannia. Captain Grant? Why, he's dead, isn't he? And just how would he get a bottle where he's at? Go on. Get on with ya. Captain Grant's our father. And he's not dead. I'm Mary Grant, and this is my brother Robert. Oh, no offense intended, miss. He was a good man, he was. The best this line ever had. It's just that it's, uh, hard to take serious, a note in a bottle, I mean. Still, uh, I suppose it could happen. And that's why we just have to see his lordship before he sails. Oh, I'm sorry, miss. I've had my orders. Nobody aboard except invited guests. But we've come all the way from Plymouth. It has cost me my last franc. And we haven't had a thing to eat. So that's it. Another trick, is it? Get out of here with your wild tales, your hard-luck stories. You almost had me for a minute. [Guard] Go on. Stand clear of the gate there. Come on. [Clanking] - [Woman] Lovely. - [Man] Thank you. You two, come back here! [Guard] Come back, I say! [Guard] You two, come here at once! - [Guard] Did you hear me? - Good evening. - [Guard] Come back, I say! - Good evening. Come out now, wherever you are. You wouldn't want me to lose my bloomin' job now, would ya? How do we get past this one? Good night, sir. Oh, very simple. Just walk nonchalantly up the plank backwards. Yes. In all the confusion, he won't be able to tell you from the departing guests. Go on now. Go on. [Guard] Good night, sir. Good night, sir. [Guard] Good night, sir. - Come on. - You now. Go on. Go on, go on. [Guard] Good night, sir. Good night. Little boy, would you be so kind as to get my wrap for me? - I think I left it in the... - You! What are you doing? [Shrieks] Stop those children! - Excuse me. Good evening. - [Guard] Come back you two! [Guard] Come back! Stop, you two! Come on, stop! Come on back, you two! Come back! [Murmuring, laughter] [Man] May I get you some more turkey? - [Woman #1] Not too much. - [Woman #2] It's delicious. Charming. Lovely party. I hear Lord Glenarvan is going to the Mediterranean this year. [Man #1] Yes, he so much enjoys the season. [Man #2] How long does he plan to be away this time? [Man #1] Six months. [Man #2] He seems very proud of this new, uh, steamship. Good evening. Cloves from Madagascar. It is not bad for English ham. [chuckles] Oh, excuse me, madam. [Screams] [Woman] There's someone under the table! Look! There they are! Head them off the other way. [Everyone talking] - Oh, let me go! - Why? [Guard] Come back, you two! Come back! Ah! Come here. Come here now. I gotcha. I got you! Oh! Let me go! You let him alone! Oh! It's you, your lordship. - Isn't it? - I dare say, but who are you? Your lordship, we must speak to you. - We're from Plymouth. - I'm Mary. This is my brother. - Our father's Captain Grant. - Of Britannia. - [Mary] He's alive. Send a ship. - [Robert] Quick. Now, just a minute. Come along. We'll talk it over. Now then, how do you know your father's still alive? - He put a note in a bottle. - The professor Paganel found it. - Oh, that again. - What do you mean? Ever since I posted the reward for news on your father's ship, people have been turning up with notes they've found in bottles... - How many is this, John? - Twenty-two, father. If I had my way, every last one of the culprits would be hanged from the yardarm. Exploiting human misery, it is. Nothing more vicious, more treacherous. But it is from my father. I can tell. Monsieur Paganel, show them the note you found. [Speaks French] Well... Oh, I'm sorry. - Wrong bottle. - [Laughter] This is the one. First question: Where'd you find the bottle? You see, I went fishing with some students. You cut open a fish and found the bottle. Oui, oui, milord, a 220-pound shark. Throw this man off the ship before I turn him over to the police. - No, your lordship. - But it is the truth, what I tell you. Why should a shark swallow a bottle? Oh, what was in his mind, I don't know. I tell you only what was in his stomach. You make a career of this, do you, exploiting children? I am Jacques Eliacin Francois Paganel. Professor of geography, University of Paris. My credentials, milord. Oh! [Mumbling] Forged, I imagine, like the note in the bottle. - All right, steward. - Come along. [Paganel speaking French] - Oh, no, you can't. - Just a minute, children. I have something to say to you. If we could be alone for a moment. Take your hands off me, monsieur. Never have I been thrown from any place in my life. Let's not set a precedent. [Speaks French] Children, don't you think I'd be the first to respond if I thought there was a chance of finding your father or his crew? I'd go to the ends of the earth. And that's no idle boast. The Glenarvan motto: "Persevero." Been the family creed for 800 years. But it's not a hoax. I saw the note myself, and I know my father wrote it. The way he makes his letters. Just more clever than the rest, that's all. When you consider the odds, it'd be fantastic, finding the bottle. But this business about it being swallowed by a shark... Well, what would my father have to do, come back here himself and say, "I wrote the note. Come and find me"? Did I understand you to say you came from Plymouth? Tell Osmond to get cabins ready. We'll drop them off there. - Very well. - But what about Paganel? We can't go off and leave him. Now, my dear, I'm only doing what's best for you. [Speaks French] How'd he get past you in the first place? How did he get past you, if it comes to that? - Wait... - [horse whinnies] Here's his lordship's wine. - [Guard] And about time too. - A bit late, aren't you, Charlie? It'll be a pretty rough trip if his lordship doesn't get his wine. Follow me, please. This way, miss. Cabin number five, on the starboard side. 'Course, Fitchet's a lot older than you. Maybe not actually in years, but... Oh, he's been around more. I don't know what you mean by that. There's probably nobody else in the world my age who's made as many trips to the Mediterranean. Well, that's just it. I mean... ...have you ever been to... ...South America, for instance? As a matter of fact, no. - [Mary] Pacific Ocean. Ever seen that? - It's only an ocean. You should have waited and had breakfast with my father. He'd have to give the order to change course for South America. Oh, he would go. Nothing could stop him. If it were for something you could believe in, and not this... note in a bottle. Let me ask you something. If you were a castaway and you had a bottle, would you put a note in it and throw it into the sea? Oh, I don't think so. After all, it's such a small chance. - Isn't it? - What would you do then? Just sit there with the empty bottle until you died or something? All right, I suppose I would try it. But I wouldn't expect someone to find it inside a shark. Well, if that's where they did find it, you wouldn't expect them to just forget about you, would you? [John] You never saw that Frenchman before, until he showed up with the bottle, and yet you believe every word he says? And no matter what he says, you and your father refuse to believe him. Suppose I'd told you I'd found a bottle with a note in it. - Would you believe me? - Well, did you? - Yes. - And what did it say? It said... ..."Disregard first message." I suppose you think that's funny, don't you? You've got your father, so to you this is just a big joke. Wait a minute. I'm not making a joke of it. I'm trying to show you. - Do you mind? - I'll make you an offer. What kind of an offer? I don't believe this story about the shark swallowing the bottle, but I am getting fed up with these infernal trips to the Mediterranean. [Gasps] Down boy. Good old boy. I'll bring you a bun or something later. - That's a good boy. - [Barking] Bonjour! In case you've emptied your own pockets. And just don't let any shark get this away from you. [Chuckles] Thank you. I assure you, mademoiselle, your case shall be properly presented. After all, Father, suppose it was you cast away. Do you think I would give up if I had even the slightest clue? I'd live up to all the legends of Glenarvan, persevere if I had to move heaven and earth. Why don't we try Corsica Thursday? - Will you listen? - Haven't been there for years. Suppose you were cast away and had a bottle. You wouldn't sit staring at it until you died, would you? You'd try putting a note into it. Suppose for some reason, it did get swallowed by a shark? Most unlikely, I'd say. Very well, then. If you won't listen, I shall be getting off at Plymouth with Mary and Robert. - [Glenarvan] Come, come. - [John] I feel strongly. If that's the way you feel about it, let's look at the note. Where is it? - In the bottle. - Where's that? - The Frenchman has it. - Confound it, where's the Frenchman? You had him thrown off the ship in Glasgow. That's a fine thing. When I want something, no one takes notice. - I drop a casual remark... - Casual remark? "Throw him off the ship before I call the police! We ought to hang him!" Now we're in a fix. That Frenchman might be anywhere by now. Where's Captain Mangles? - Tell Captain Mangles to... Oh! - Oui, milord. Good gracious, the Frenchman! I thought... Oh, but I give you my word, I was put off the ship. Fortunately, I do not let such things upset me. The note, milord. Useless. There's practically nothing left. Oh, but with a little study, a little intelligence, it is possible to make out what is said. You will see one thing without question: Their location is given as 37 degrees, 11 minutes - south in latitude. - That's no good without the longitude. Consider first, milord, on the 37th parallel, there are only a few places they could be. I've always said: If Captain Grant's anywhere, he's in Australia. It's logical if you know about shipping and commerce. Use the head, milord. The note makes reference to being captured, no? You can make out the word "Indian" or "Indians." So where on the 37th parallel would they be captured by Indians? - Australia, or course. - Aborigines, yes. Indians, no. By George, I've got it! South America. Couldn't be anywhere else. If he was captured by Indians, the west coast. It's a matter of simple logic, monsieur. We'll go there. And follow the 37th parallel over the Andes until we find Captain Grant. Osmond, find Captain Mangles. Tell him I'm gonna change course. - Thank you! - Oh! [chuckles] Now, don't forget it was me who arranged... - Thank you. - Thank you, milord. Oh, please. I'm an Englishman, you know. (music) Merci, merci Merci beaucoup (music) Merci, milord Glenarvan (music) Merci, merci Merci beaucoup (music) Merci, milord Glenarvan (music) [Paganel singing in French] [Paganel continues singing] There, milord, is where we must go. The pass of Antuco. Then follow the parallel until we find Captain Grant. Jolly good trick to throw a bottle into the ocean from up there, I say. [Chuckles] Ah, but could he not put the bottle into a river? Then would it not flow down to the sea? Eh? [Robert] (music) Gran-po, gran-po Gran-po, gran-po (music) No, no. Grimpons. - Grimpons. - That means: "Let's climb." It is the French recipe for the good life. Whatever you want to do, don't be afraid to do it - for fear of failure. - Humph. (music) Don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain (music) Let's climb, let's climb (music) Let's climb, let's climb Let's climb (music) Don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain (music) Let's climb, let's climb Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb (music) And if we fall, crash, bang and die a terrible death (music) Never mind, we've had the joy The joy of the climb (music) Oh, don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain (music) Let's climb, let's climb Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb (music) Let's climb, let's climb Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb (music) Let's climb, let's climb Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb (music) [Wind howling] [Paganel] Oh, look! Look! - Straight down that valley, there. - Where? Do you see it, milord? [Paganel] The river into which one might throw a bottle. - By Jove, yes. - And an Indian village. I say, this could be just the place. Have a look. Better make camp here tonight and get an early start in the morning. Hey, you. Make camp. Stay here tonight. - No stay. Drangopeeri. - Hmm? - Drangopeeri. - What's the fellow talking about? It is not Spanish. It must be a local Indian term. Hey, hey, hey. What means "drangopeeri"? Drangopeeri. Drangopeeri. Oh! Uh... He wants to tell us... It gets terribly cold up here. Oh, we build a fire, no matter how cold, no matter how... [laughs] ...drangopeeri. - We stay in hut. - No stay. Listen to me. I tell you when to go and when to stay. - No stay. - We stay here tonight! You stay. We go. Don't you dare to try and tell me... I think the fellow really means it. Well, that's done it. Without the horses, we're helpless. - We'll never make it. - Can't we still go on on foot? But of course, mademoiselle. The Indians have crossed these mountains on foot for hundreds of years. - Even drive their sheep. - Oh, good. - When do we start? - We're not going to start. I'm not gonna go leaping about like a... Like a confounded mountain sheep, thank you! Oh, please, your lordship. Please! No, no, mademoiselle, uh... He's right. We'll return to the ship with the Indians and get some crewmen who are younger. Age has got nothing to do with it. I'll take over and lead the expedition. You can remain in your deck chair. You lead the way? Ridiculous. Have the whole lot of you lost in no time. On the other hand, with me in command it would take a great deal more than... [chuckles] ...drangopeeri to turn us back. That's right, isn't it? [All] Right, your lordship. [Guitar playing] Monsieur Paganel, do you think we might have one tonight? When you are in the poultry yard, it is a good time to wish you catch the egg. See? Look at this. See? Any slight tremor of the earth, and it starts to swing. But if you're asleep, how could you tell? Oh, maybe all night I sleep with one eye open. Perhaps his lordship will sleep better if we do not tell him before tomorrow what drangopeeri means. Eh? Your pleasure, mademoiselle? (music) Castaway, castaway (music) Trust in your star (music) You know I will find you (music) Wherever you are (music) Though all your dreams (music) May be tossed by the tide (music) Cling to your hopes (music) Never cast them aside (music) Castaway, castaway (music) Though you may be (music) Lost in the wilderness (music) Over the sea (music) I will discover (music) Your castaway shore (music) Then you'll be a castaway (music) No more (music) You'll be a castaway (music) No more (music) It's my father's favorite. Ever since I was a little girl, I've always thought it sad. Not the way you sang it. Oh, it's just how I feel tonight, I suppose. Oh, it's all so exciting. We're up here, Father's down there, the stars pointing the way. It's almost like being in heaven. - I know. - Ah, there you are, my boy. Better get some sleep. Got an early start. - We're too excited to sleep. - Hmm. So I see. Come along with me just the same. Wait. I want to make a wish on that star. What could you wish for that you haven't got? That my father would go somewhere and get lost. Just for a little while, you understand? - What are you doing? - This is to wake me up. - Wake you up? - Yes, in case... - In case what? - Oh, nothing. And what is this, may I ask? My watch, milord. Perhaps I want to look at it during the night. [chuckles] How very peculiar. Oh, Robert, really. Do put those things away. But if there's an earthquake, I want to see it. Earthquake? Who said anything about an earthquake? Oh. I'm so stupid, milord. I didn't realize it until later. The Indian. When he did, uh... ...that, you see? He did not mean it was cold, no. He meant drangopeeri. Earthquake. This is the land of many earthquakes. Oh, gracious me. In the whole world, no place has such big, such beautiful, such magnificent earthquakes as right here. But it is one chance in a million we should be so fortunate. [Chuckles] Yes, yes, of course. Quite right. This place looks as if it's been here hundreds of years. Doesn't it? I mean, uh, it's safe to assume that it'll last one more night. Eh? Oui, monsieur? Oui, milord. And I'll wake you up if one comes, your lordship. [Rumbling] - It worked! - Oh, Robert, do be quiet. - An earthquake of the first magnitude. - [Crashing] I say, do you have to shake the whole place? By Jove, it's an earthquake! [Glenarvan] Outside, everybody! Oh! Oh, magnificent. This is an experience that makes our entire expedition worthwhile! [Crashing] [Screams] By Jove, that was a narrow squeak. Whoa! [Mary] Oh! I say, this is getting rather dangerous. Then we'll attempt to change course. Everybody to port. It worked. That's better. Much obliged. - [Glenarvan] Look out. - This way, everybody. Quick! To port, quick! - Port, quickly! - No, starboard. - Port, I say. - Starboard! [Glenarvan] Where are we going now? Perfect timing. Oh! Abandon ship! No, wait. There's a hole in the ice. - We don't know where it goes. - We'll soon find out. Alpine-type glacier. Risk minimum. We'll never get out of here. Alive. The ice melts and gets out. Why can't we? [Yodeling] [Yodeling echoes] [Yodeling] Isn't it beautiful? Oh, they'll never believe us when we get home. If we get home. [Yodeling] Look out, everybody! Duck! Where are we going? [Glenarvan] Starboard, I tell you! This is most peculiar. Look out! - That was close. - Oh! [Robert] Mary! Come on! - Where's Robert? - [Glenarvan] Here's his hat. [Mary] Robert! Robert, can you hear me? [Robert echoing] Not down there! I'm up here! Oh! A giant condor. A Sarcorhamphus gryphus. Robert! Hold on! I don't have to. She won't let go. This is true. She will not let go until she reaches her nest. Reaches her nest? Yes. High in the mountains. No doubt she has little ones that must... [gasps] Oh! Hang on, Robert! - We're coming! - [Gunshot] [Crashing] Ah! - Robert! - I got dizzy coming down. But it was a jolly good view from up there. Oh, thank goodness you're all right. - I wonder who fired the shot. - Perhaps he did. A Patagonian. Magnificent. It's like turning back the history book hundreds of years. Ha! Hope he's not dangerous. Permit me. I've learned a few primitive words. [Speaks foreign language] [Speaks foreign language] [Speaks foreign language] Anyway, even if you don't understand, I want to thank you for saving my brother's life. Happy to do. Heavens, he speaks English. First-class shooting, sir. First time, right through the heart. No, shoot through heart, bird go limp. Drop small boy. But shoot back of head, bird go stiff. Wings go up. He circle down, land boy safe. You mean you purposely induced motor paralysis - through damage on the medulla. - Not understand. Can you tell us where our father is? - He was captured. - On the 37th parallel. They were kidnapped. Washed up on the shore. Captured! Three white men. Indians hold them for ransom money. You very slow to come. Are they all right? Last time I hear, they're well. But very tired of being prisoners. What do you mean, last time you hear? Don't you come from where they're held? No! I'm an Araucanian chief. Thalcave. My people do not rob. Do not steal. Do not hold prisoners for ransom. - Well, where are they? - Far away. At the foot of the mountain. Great plain, as far as you can see. - Many days to cross. - The Pampas. Well, couldn't you take us there? First we stop at my village for horses and supplies. Then Thalcave will try help you find them. Much rain there. You sleep in tree. May come flood. Flood? By George, that's a good one. Giant ombu tree. Phytolacca dioica. Magnificent specimen. [Robert] Please, may we sleep in it? You can sleep where you like, but I don't intend to roost in a tree like a confounded sparrow. Pitch my tent just here. [Horse whinnies] [Horses whinny] [Rumbling] You, in tree! Listen! Flood come! Much water! You stay in tree. I bring help. - My father? - I'll wake him. To be safe, we tie our things so they do not fall. [Rumbling] Flood come. You go quick to tree. I ride for help. Not even raining. [Shouting] [Whooping] - Yah! - [Whinnies] [Paganel] Make ready for the storm. Look, the floods. Father! Father! John, be careful! - Father! Hurry up! - Now what's going on? - Come with me. - Can't I get a decent night's rest? [Both yelling] Come on! They've got it. Hold on! Highly irregular. Flood like this and not even raining. [Birds chirping] [Paganel whistling] [Sneezes] - [Sneezes] - [Paganel] With food in your stomach, the world will feel a lot brighter. [chuckles] Oh! Look out below! Oh! Sorry, milord.

[Quacking] [Glenarvan] Robert! Can you see anything that looks like an Indian on horseback? - Coming to our rescue? - Only some birds. Only some... [sneezes] Only gone down half an inch in two days. We'll be here for ten years at this rate. Ha-ha! Cheer up, milord. We pay no rent. Mother Nature sets the table for us, and, fortunately, we have plenty of water. [Chuckles] That's very fortunate, I must... [sneezes] Very fortunate. My father will never trust another Indian. But Thalcave's different. He said, "I bring help." And he will. - If he got through. - Don't even think such things. All right. But if I may paraphrase what a wise girl once said to me many years ago, "If you were marooned in an ombu tree, and you had logs and something to tie them with, you wouldn't just sit there till you died or something, would you?" That's very good. For a girl, I mean. [Sighs] I suppose most girls are taught embroidery and things, but Mother died after Robert was born, and Father being a sea captain... When we first met, I had a different impression. Most girls can be rather silly. Do you know what I mean? - No, I don't. - Well... - You're different. - How different? I don't know how to say it. I had it all worked out last night. Sounds rather silly now, though. What does? Well, you don't expect things of a girl. Certain things like climbing mountains and going through floods. Making the most of it. You know what I mean? Don't think I do. Well, I want to say that... ...I think you've been just fine. For a girl. What I really mean is that... ...if we get out of here alive, and when we're old enough... - John. - Mary. There's the log you've needed for your raft. [John] That's it. Just what we need. Perfect. [John] Got it. - Oh! - Keep out of the way! [Growling] - It's a tiger. - No, no, it's a jaguar. Felix onca. Get that beast out of here. [Paganel] It's probably as frightened of us as we are of it. - Just a big cat, milord. - Get rid of it. Get rid of it. Can't stand cats at the best of times. Confounded things always make me sneeze. - [Growling] - Go on! Get out of here! [Roars] [John] Go on! Get out of here. Don't, John. The poor thing. [Bird screeching] [Whispering] Do not move. Not an eyelash. [Starting to sneeze] [Growling] [Sniffing] [Stifling sneeze] [Growling] [Loud sneeze] [Glenarvan sneezing] [Rumbling] [Sneezing] [Glenarvan] "Marooned in ombu tree. Latitude 37 degrees south, longitude 66 degrees west. Send help. Immediately." [Paganel] One, two, three, four, five, six, - seven... - [thunder] More than two kilometers away. My father always told me, never go near a tree in a thunderstorm. [Paganel] One, two, three, four, - five... - [thunder] I think it's getting closer. Yes. At 35 degrees centigrade sound travels at approximately - one... - [explosion] [Glenarvan] Good heavens, the tree's on fire! We'll put it out. [Growling] No time for that sort of thing. Get out of the way! You see? It's too late now. Abandon the ombu tree, milord. It has a remarkably low flashpoint. [John] Onto the raft! Our only chance. - Look out! - [Growling] Oh, no! - I'll get it. - No, don't. Apparently we have our choice: Eaten raw down there or roasted alive up here. Hold on, everybody! Mother Nature comes to our rescue. A water spout! [Glenarvan] Ahoy! Ahoy! Hmm. We're still several degrees off course, you know. Hurry up with the canvas. There's a breeze coming up. Aye, aye, captain. You're strangely quiet, aren't you? Sorry, milord. I was thinking. I don't know which is worse. You so happy you sing all the time, or so glum you won't even talk. "Ze ombu tree is gorgeous. Enjoy it." Ha! I am stupid. Stupid! Stupid! I know, but that hasn't worried you till now. It is better they do not hear. What are you talking about? It is something I remembered in the night. How could I be so stupid, I don't know, but the shark. [Shouting in distance] - It was a mako shark... - Ahoy! As well as I know anything, I should know that the mako shark lives only in... Be quiet. - [Shouting in distance] - Ahoy there! Ahoy! Ahoy there! - [Shouting in distance] - I think I see it. There. A canoe! Ahoy there. Ahoy... It's an Indian war canoe. This is a fine fix. We're completely unarmed. It's Thalcave! He did come back! Thal... Ho-ho, Thalcave, my good man. Delighted to see you. - [Thalcave] I bring news. - News? What kind of news? You come in canoe. We go fast. To village where they hold prisoners. Three sail men. Three sailor... Oh, monsieur, we found them. It's like a miracle. - [Laughter] - [Mary] Thank you! [Glenarvan] I say, careful! Come along. Let's get aboard. Careful, now. Careful. You're a welcome sight, sir, believe me. Is this thing safe? Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50. Now it's come, I can hardly believe it! White men! [shouting] Stop it! Stop it! Who are these people? Where's Captain Grant? Is not right men? It's all my fault. How could I be so stupid? It's what I started to tell you, milord. About the mako shark. What about the blasted thing? It lives only in and around the Indian Ocean. That's what the word "Indian" means in the note. Not that they were captured by Indians. If you knew this, why didn't you tell me before I paid all that money? I kept hoping, milord, that maybe somehow I could be wrong. This can mean only one thing. Captain Grant is in Australia. Australia! That's where I wanted to go, only I let you talk me out of it. Oh, my dear children. I'm sorry it all had to end like this. Listen! Thalcave speak. For many years, my people hunt. Trail game many miles. Sometimes sneak up but game not there. But Indian knows if game not there, it somewhere else. Keep looking. Otherwise, Indian die out many years ago. Keep looking? He's right, you know. Now we know where Captain Grant really is. And by Jove, we'll go and find him. Oh, thank you, Thalcave. Thank you. - How does she look to you? - Just what we need. Ain't a ship hereabouts could overhaul her. - What about the steam? - We can learn. The old man wants to know what happened to the Britannia. - Maybe I should tell him. - You're not serious, are you? Maybe I should tell him. The very spot, your lordship, where she sank beneath the waves. Me own dear brother lost his life trying to put out in a small boat to save the crew. - It was shocking... - All right, pay them off. - Very good. - Thank you, lordship. Much obliged. - [Glenarvan] I won't see anymore. - Very good. Look at that! Ridiculous, preposterous! How can a ship go down in a dozen different places, sometimes 500 miles apart, answer me that! Confounded wharf rats! Lie to you. Take your money. Cut your throat, given half a chance. How the dickens can I tell where to start, eh? - What do you want? - Mr. Ayrton to see you. - I didn't want to see anybody else. - This is a gentleman. I hope I haven't arrived at an awkward moment. I couldn't get here sooner. I would have warned you. You'll find very little integrity among some of the men who frequent our waterfront. It happens that I have the very information you require. - About my father? - This is the daughter of Captain Grant. Well, if I could reunite this delightful child and her gallant father, that is the reward I'm interested in. - Were you ever in Plymouth? - Plymouth, England? No, I haven't had that pleasure. May I inquire, sir, as to the nature of your information? Two years ago, I was caught in a violent storm in the Tasman Sea. We picked up a poor fellow, badly battered and half-drowned just off the coast of New Zealand. - New Zealand? - He said he was from the Britannia. She'd gone down with all hands. He died in the night, and our ship combed the area the following day. Until I read about the message in the bottle, I had no idea - there were any survivors. - Why wasn't the sinking reported - when you reached land? - I assumed it was. I was only a passenger on the ship. If he landed in New Zealand, he must have been captured by the Maoris. I'll report this to the authorities. I'm afraid it isn't as easy as that. - Why ever not? - You haven't had my experience in dealing with our government. You learn to get along in spite of them. They talk endlessly and they need authorization from London. You'll be lucky if they're ready in a year. Anything could happen to him in a year. - What do you suggest? - Oh, I can't get mixed up in this. I've told you all that I know. I've got my own estates to run. Sir, the lives of three men are at stake. I'd like to speak to this gentleman alone, please. The trouble is New Zealand is not in the Indian Ocean. There's something strange. Very strange. I don't care what he says. I've seen that man. - You're just imagining it. - No, I'm not. I can't stand people that look at me like that. "Delightful child." "Gallant father." It's a good sign that neither of you take to him, because everything else that you've welcomed with open arms has turned out dead wrong. [Shuddering] - I don't wish to break the law. - Certainly not. I don't intend to leave Captain Grant in the hands of bloodthirsty cannibals. So, I appeal to you, as a man with experience and knowledge of local conditions to help us before it's too late. All right, I'll gather up some men who know the Maoris and who can handle any kind of situation. By Jove, you mean we just go in and have it out with them? Oh, no. We'll take along some supplies to barter, and if Grant and his men are still alive, we'll buy them back. Capital idea. I can't tell you how grateful I am to you. I need hardly remind you that we must be discreet about what we plan. Of course. Don't want to be tied down by a lot of red tape, do we? Just my son John and Captain Mangles, otherwise not a word to a soul. Yes, just as it should be. [Man] Get this crate down in the hull. [Men shouting] Motley looking lot of fellows you've got together. Well, when you look for men to go into Maori country, you don't choose from among the social elite. [Laughs] Jolly well put. I didn't realize you'd require quite so much merchandise. The days have gone when one could impress the natives with a handful of colored beads. If they choose to sell their prisoners dearly, we'd better be prepared. I see. John, you've got to tell me what's going on out there. Ah, mademoiselle, you are too beautiful in ze new gown to worry your little head about such things. But what's in all those boxes? If my father wanted you to know, he would've told you. Every man out there looks like a fugitive from the penal colony. John, you've got to do something. Don't let this man make a fool of your father. Just because he calls you a delightful child and you don't like it, he's trying to make a fool of my father. It is better that we think it, monsieur, than give him the opportunity to prove it. Let me tell you something, both of you. My father huffs and puffs a little bit, and we've all smiled at him just in fun, but I don't think anybody is going to make a fool of him as easily as... Well, certain people I could name. [Gasps] And now, if you'll excuse me. Patience, dear. Nous verrons ce que nous verrons. We shall see what we shall see. I'll wager she's faster than any ship in the Royal Navy. I'd say that steam was the coming thing if it weren't so complicated to handle. Don't know about complicated. It's simple. - Yes? - Pardon, milord. Could I talk to you sometime, before too long? - What about? - No matter how much I think about it, it is always the same. Captain Grant is in Australia. There is no way the note could mean he is in New Zealand. My dear fellow, don't worry about that note. Mr. Ayrton knows precisely - where the Britannia went down. - Of course. Milord, I'll be the happiest man in the world if it turns out that once again I'm wrong. - I have no doubt you will be. - If it's no trouble, - I'd like to see the engine room. - Delighted to take you. I think you'll find there's nothing complicated about steam. It's a beautiful day. Why not enjoy it? Let bygones be bygones. Now that we're at sea, I can let you in on our secret, if you're interested. Those boxes you were wondering about. Would you like to know what's in them? Trinkets, trade goods. They're for barter so we can buy your father's freedom. - Who told you this? - Mr. Ayrton. And you believed him? All right, Miss Suspicious. If it'll make you more companionable, I'll take you below and show you. [Men chattering] Well, here you are. All right, Pandora, which box do you want me to open? That one. You sure you don't have a guilty feeling? After all, it is rather like spying on someone. Especially when they've gone out of their way to be nice. - Open it. - I will. [Straining] Nothing is too much trouble if it satisfies your curiosity. Voila, mademoiselle. Trade goods. Trinkets, he said. So that's his game. He's using my father's ship as a gunrunner. Pity you did that. Wilcox, down here! [Whispering] We must warn the others. I'll lead them off. Make for the door. [Men shouting] - [Man #1] There he is! - [Man #2] I see him. [Man #3] Grab the boy! Oh! Now, is that a nice way to behave when we're taking you to meet your father? Come on. Make no noise. Just stop the paddles. Anything else, and I'll shoot. [Bell dings] Been to New Zealand before? Yes, twice. Do as I tell you. Perhaps you'll live to make it three times. [Bell dings] We're stopping. That is most strange. - Raise the hands. Quietly. - Do as he says, Robert. - [Screams] - [John] Help, Lord Glenarvan! Help! Lord Glenarvan! Help! Lord Glenarvan! I thought I heard the boy call for help. You did. Now give me that gun, and no harm will come to him. [Glenarvan] You can't put us out there without oars. It's not human! Oh, the current will carry you to the shore, if that's any consolation. But I'm afraid we'll have to keep your crew on board until they've taught us the fine points of using steam. We're unaccustomed to such luxuries in the South Pacific. - You'll pay for this. - You've got it backwards, old man, we have been paid for it, and quite handsomely. Cheer up, Frenchy. You promised you'd be the happiest man in the world if you were wrong about Grant being in Australia. And you were. Brian and Riley, lay her off and stand by to make sail. - [Man] Aye, aye, sir. - You were in Plymouth. My father signed you on the day he sailed. As third mate. What a memory. You'll hang for this, you know. I'll see to it personally. I'll make a report to the admiralty. [Chuckling] You do that. And here's a bottle to put it in. Hope it isn't swallowed by a shark. - Lower away! - You'll never get away with this. That's what Grant said when we put him over the side at this spot. With his two rather foolishly loyal mates. If you're lucky, you might all end up in the same stewpot. [Men laughing] If anyone is interested, I might explain. It is the influence of the west wind drift playing against the East Australian current that might drive us right up onto the shore. Yes, yes, yes. That's the second of my ships he's got. First the Britannia, and now my beautiful new steam yacht. It's all clear now. It was a mutiny. There's no reason why he should lie about it. My father was set adrift here... Then he must be a prisoner of the Maoris. What did he mean, we might all end up in the same stewpot? Not to change the subject, but our reception committee seems to be waiting. [Glenarvan] Maoris. Hundreds of them. A deuce of a fix, no trinkets to bargain with. What have we got to offer, huh? Just us, I suppose. [Shouting] [Laughter] - Good gracious! - You come a stranger. I'll take you in. I have prepared a place for thee in the presence of thine enemy. - [Shouting] - [Screams] It's all right. I'm sure he's harmless. What think ye now? I be crazy, eh? Not a bit of it. I be smart. Mark ye well, the words of old Bill Gaye. Bill Gaye? Weren't you the mate on my father's ship? Depends entirely who your father was. What was his ship? And who you be, for that matter? You see? I be smart. Makes a difference who she is. I'm Mary Grant. My father's Captain Grant of the Britannia. Well, why didn't you say so before? Fine ship, she was. I walked her decks across the seven seas. [Clattering] Woe, be unto thee, O Moab, for thy sons are taken captive. - Who is he? - He seems to be the mate - from the Britannia. - Do you know where he is? Can you tell me? Where is Captain Grant? Have you no eyes? Can you not see? - He's gone. - Where? Same as before. Diane's Inlet. - Did the Maoris take him? - Nay, he be smart too. He learns the way to keep alive. For they need him when they get more guns. Guns? That must be Ayrton. Aye, that's who it be. Somehow the devil has got another ship. - Were there three of you? - Aye, three of us there were. Captain Grant, McKnabb and old Bill Gaye against Ayrton and all of his mutinous crew. [Shouting] My father, Captain Grant, did he and McKnabb go together to Diane's Inlet? Nay, my child. I say unto you, McKnabb, he was not smart. [Cackles] He was caught when he tried to escape. - Poor devil. - [Shouting] [Cackling] What's he laughing at? For this child I have prayed. And the Lord hath granted my petition, which I asked of him. This is the night the Lord hath given us our salvation. What think ye? Could a man force himself through there? Even a man who has gone without food to make himself as thin as a man can be? Nay, I say unto you it is impossible. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. Robert, do you think you could crawl through there? - Maybe if I tried very hard. - [Cackling] - You be smart too. - If he could, what good would it do? I'll show you now. The Lord helps them that helps themselves. Two years we took to make it. From the hairs of our heads, from the garments we wore, from a thousand things we gathered. Preposterous. What could the boy possibly do all by himself? There'll be more to it than that. For this be the night of the harker. Bide ye your time till the night be well be gone. And the horns sound and the flames will leap upward and the devil hath seized the souls of our captors. Then, I will show the way. [Shouting in native language] - [Mary] Nobody's looking. Now! - [John] Up you go. - It looks awfully small. - [Bill] Go on. Go on! [Straining] I'm stuck. Let out all the air. [Exhaling] I don't know which is worse. A crazy man who thinks he's smart, or a Frenchman who admits he's stupid. Hold that. [Grunts] Now, to get the pendulum swinging. [cackles] - Oh, do be careful. - [Cackling] Lower away. I've the unhappy feeling we're going out of the frying pan into the fire. [Straining, cackling] He can't get over. The rope's not long enough. Lower away. - He still can't do it. - Go on. Lower away! That's all there is. - Then let it go! - [Gasps] [Cackling] He did it! - [Men chanting] - [Horn blowing] Tie that down there. [Glenarvan] Deuce of a fix. [Bill] Off to the mountain. [Glenarvan] We'll never outrun these fellows. By Jove, I never saw a rope burn like that. Gunpowder. It's woven in like a fuse. Aye, what say you? Who be mad now? [cackles] Vengeance is mine. I will repay, sayeth the Lord. Father, come on! If this is the sacred volcano of the taboo, they dare not follow. You know of such things even though you be a stranger? I be smart too. [laughs] We be two of a kind. - By Jove, they've stopped. - What think ye now of old Bill Gaye? Be he crazy or be he smart? They dare not set foot here, for all this is taboo. I say, that's splendid, isn't it? [Speaking in native language] But they're moving on again. A slight miscalculation. I'm afraid we're on the wrong volcano. Just as I thought. Out of the frying pan, into the fire. Don't worry, milord. Come help with this. - [John] What are you planning to do? - Uncork the bottle, let the genie free. On your marks. Poussons tous! [Glenarvan] I've got it. Everybody, push. Un... ...deux... ...trois... [grunts] Lucky shot, that. Chance in a million. At the university, I'm considered the wizard of the croquet court. Come ye, where we be safe. Oh, it's horrible! Have no fear, mademoiselle. The Maoris can run faster than the lava. Enjoy it! And now, Mr. Gaye, to Captain Grant. Aye, to Captain Grant. [Bill] Old Bill Gaye, he's got it all planned out. [Cackling] All right, Grant. Tell them there are six more boxes, nearly 200 rifles, still in the hold. I'll send the lot ashore as soon as they hand over the money. How do I know the rest are as good as this one? - I give you my word. - That's what you offered last time, when you unloaded a pile of junk. [Speaks native language] Now really. Every time I do something charitable, I live to regret it. - Like putting you ashore alive. - And I intend to stay alive. By not recommending rifles I haven't examined. My beautiful, beautiful yacht. If they've done anything to damage her, I'll have them strung up by their thumbs. How did you know where she was going to be? This be where they always unload. - In Diane's Inlet. - Diane's Inlet? Oh, sacre tonnerre! In the note, what I thought said "Indian" was really... Oh! I'm stupid. Stupid. Stupid! Cheer up, my friend. Your stupidity may turn out to be of divine inspiration. Mr. Gaye, I thought we were going to find Father. We be, we be. Looky now. It's Father! [Mary] He looks well. Thank goodness. They're all getting into boats. They're coming here. We have a little time to prepare our reception. [Thumping] - I come to see thy ship. - No one comes aboard. Surely, you be not afraid of old Bill Gaye. Bill Gaye? All he had was a crown of glory. - Know ye not that? - [Grunts] [Chattering] [Man] How many cards do you want? Where's mine? [Paganel] How do we get past him? Excuse me, sir. But is this Lord Glenarvan's yacht? Well, sonny, I guess... Here! Wait a minute! Ain't you the boy that's with them. Come back here! We have to break the door down the best we can. - [Man #1] Jacks, gentlemen. - [Man #2] Thomson's got money. All right. Your deal, Bob. Hey, come here quick! - The brig! - Brig! [Cackling] Know ye not what the Good Book says? He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it. [Bill cackles] [Glenarvan] Send him over to me! Ooh! Got him. [Cackling] I suppose we'll have to open every box. Put the best ones on top. [Glenarvan] Ayrton, you scoundrel! Don't move. You've made it long enough to hang. Hello, Glenarvan. Welcome aboard. Well, here we are. This makes us even, doesn't it, uh... You've got your ship back, and I'm bringing you Grant. - So, uh, why don't we, uh... - Captain. Take him below with the rest of the scoundrels. Aye! You've sown the wind. And I say to ye, ye reap the whirlwind! [Gaye] Back, you dogs! Back, I say! - [Speaks in native language] - Bill Gaye! - What on earth...? - [Mary] Father! Mary. Robert! [Bill] You think I be crazy, don't ya? [Bill shouting at native and cackling] - How did you find me? - Monsieur Paganel. - He's a professor. - He found the note. - Glenarvan took us. - We've been around the world. - We were captured by Maoris. - Maoris. [Grant] My dear children. Oh, how I've prayed for this day. - I was beginning to give up. - Must be catching your cold. [Grant] And now you're suddenly here, and I'm able to hold you both close in my arms. I can't find words to express my gratitude to all of you. We would have been here months earlier if I hadn't been stupid about the note. - Note? - The note in the bottle. The note? In the bottle? [Cackling] What think ye now? 'Twas I put that note in the bottle. [Cackling] And put the bottle in the sea. Cast thy bread on the waters for thou shalt find it after many days. But they seemed so sure it was their father's handwriting. It was. Wasn't it? Now you know my secret. Why I ran away to sea. The voice is a voice of a God-fearing man. But the hands... ...are the hands of a forger. [Cackling] Oh, par exemple! Bill, you scoundrel! Just think, if he hadn't put the note in the bottle, and if Paganel hadn't caught that shark... And if you hadn't tried to slap my face on the way to Plymouth, I wouldn't have talked Father into making this trip. Funny how things work out, isn't it? Isn't it? Here we are, all of us together. All of us. Did you ever see so many stars? Once, on top of a mountain. Did you know that there, out of the light, you can see the Southern Cross? Southern Cross? So, that's my little girl. By George, they do grow up. [Speaks French] I was just thinking to myself, no matter where you are in the world, it is always different but it is always the same. In English, you would say: "All climates are the same for love." [John] There it is. The Southern Cross.
