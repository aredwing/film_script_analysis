Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness! Thank you so much. Oh, look at you. Oh, my goodness. - Stay. - Oh, there you go. Oh, you're wet, too. Oh, dear. Thank you so much. You're welcome, sweetheart. Are dogs even allowed in here? No. Well, technically, no, but since it's after hours... and, so... you look... Like someone lost a groom. It's kind of the other way around. Do you mind if I sit down? Kitchen's closed. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the tables, They are still open. Oh, honey, you are just a mess. I'm so sorry to say it, but you are a mess. I'll bet there is just one heck of a story To explain all of this. There better be. I don't re-Open this place for anybody. Oh... Don't you worry about him. He is all bark, but no bite. It all happened so fast. You know, I was walking down the aisle one minute, And the next... Louie, hey, hey, hey. What? Babe, come, sit, sit, sit. I think this is gonna take a while. Oh, sweetheart. What's your name, kiddo? Bailey. Bailey Daley. Musical. Yeah. And this is Adam, and eve And Shirley. you're kidding. Shirley? Shirley. Well, hello, Shirley. Hello, sweetheart. All right, baby girl, Now, you start at the very beginning. And don't leave out one single thing. Okay. Uh... I guess it all started The first day I moved into my new house... I'd loved the place forever, It was my little dream house. And I saved up my money for years and years, Just vowing that if it ever came on the market, I would buy it, And, at long last, I did. Honey, I'm so proud of you. You hung in there, you stuck it out, And look at this, you made it. Well, it didn't hurt that you co-Signed on the loan. You know who would've loved this place? - Who? - Howie. Oh, Howie. Beagle extraordinaire. You know what I'm thinking, sweetie. Maybe it's time you get a new dog. I mean, this is the longest You've ever been without one. Too soon. When it's time, I'll know. Am I being a baby? Why, because you don't want to spend your first night All alone in your new house, with only the strange noises? Maybe. Oh, bales, A "total baby" doesn't buy a house All on her own, To live in and take care of all by herself. See, that's the thing. It's a great house, But I'm realizing it's a home for two. Meaning? Meaning I have a job that I love... Yes, your students are crazy about you. So are yours. Nobody's crazy about their French teacher, Except for maybe the French. I have a great mom, I have an awesome bff, Great new house... the only thing that's missing is... A dog, yes, But like you said, You'll know when you're ready. A man! I'm talking about a man. Oh, one of those. Yeah. Do you know, That between work, Howie passing, And buying a house, I haven't dated anyone since Ryan? That was ages ago. I know. Okay, you need to go and get boy-Crazy. No, I don't. I need to find my guy, my partner in crime, you know? Aw... there's the bailey Daley we all know and love. The next book we're going to read Is one of my all-Time favorites, Emily Bronte's "Wuthering heights. " No, no, no, no, it's a very good book. But it's really sad, isn't it? In a way, But it also contains One of literature's most passionate And thrilling romances. How thrilling can it be? It takes place, like, a thousand years ago! More like 200. But it's not "when" that matters, It's the story that's timeless, And what makes it so thrilling. Cathy and Heathcliff have a once-In-A-Lifetime love And it's what we all aspire to. Except for the part where it destroys them And everyone they know. Oh, sounds like my last three girlfriends. As the great poet Alfred lord Tennyson once wrote, "'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all. " Do you really believe that, miss Daley? Yes, I do. What was his name? Howie. Only the best beagle ever. So... Emily Bronte's "Wuthering heights. " Okay, lasagna couldn't all of a sudden Have less calories than baked chicken, could it? Yeah, not on this planet. Earth? Yeah, that one. Mm... bummer. Thank you. You ladies come here often? Not often enough, apparently. Translation... Are you new here? Wade Ingram, substitute gym teacher. Just filling in for terry Janssen While he recovers from back surgery. And you are...? Uh, bailey Daley. Poetry? English. Comp and lit. And this is amber. French. I teach French, I'm not French. I got it. Chicken? Uh... brave, actually, kind of. I'm somewhat daring occasionally. I was talking about your meal, but, you know. I, too, like to roll the dice Every once in a while. Good. Excuse me. Oh... I'm sorry, it's my dad, It's kind of a fantasy football league crisis. I should probably get going, But I hope to see you two around more often. Maybe grab a real meal sometime. Oh. Okay. All right. Ask and you shall receive. Yeah. So, what exactly does "share a real meal" mean? I think it means he wants to take me out, Don't you think? Yeah, then why didn't he just ask you out? I don't know, mom, we just met. I could ask him out if I wanted to, right? Yeah, well, if you want to play it that way. And by the way, if I recall correctly, You asked daddy out for the first time, didn't you? Oh, your sweet father, Sweet, shy father, God rest his soul. Yeah, if I didn't make the first move, We never would've gotten together. Well, lucky for me you did. Be that as it may, This wade fellow, from what you tell me, Will definitely let you know if he is interested. Now, check out this table. Definitely worth 75 cents. What are you talking about? This is a diamond in the rough. I see the "rough" part. Grab one end. Okay, going this way? - Yes. - Okay. you're working? But it's Sunday fun-Day.

Wade... bales, hey. And Susie. Uh, bailey, Susie. Susie, bailey. Seriously? I'm waiting for you and this is what you're doing? You're flirting with "runner-Up" over here? Uh, I should go. Yeah, sorry, you should go. We were just talking. You're so overreacting on this. I'm not overreacting. You flirt with everyone. You think I didn't notice that, but I did. Amber. And that nurse at the 5k, you made her day. Okay, so I'm a friendly guy. Your dog is "friendly". You are a player. And I don't want to play anymore. Can I get by here, please? Bailey, hey. Hi. I saw what happened there. I got some frozen peas. Oh. Pet store guy. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hey. - Thank you. Okay. Please, sit down. And the thing is, It was just nice to be dating again, you know, And, I can't lie, He was easy on the eyes. And I love his dog, Adam. His dog is so great. He's such a sweet guy. Okay, this is boring. No, not at all. okay. You know what I love about dogs? Not just that they don't talk back, there's that, But that they're so accepting. They're so capable of that unconditional love That's kind of a superhuman trait, You know? My mom says, "If you can find a man who can love you like a dog, You will have found true love," Which is... maybe why she hasn't found anyone In the 10 years since my dad has died. All right, I'm shutting up. Thank you. I really feel much better, so thanks. Hey, no problem. You ever see that wade character again? At school a few times, but I pretty much ignored him. I tried ignoring Louie forever, But I still couldn't get rid of him. Oh, so you two...? Mm-Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah. 31 years, Rockin' and sockin'. Yeah, life's full of crazy surprises. Yeah, well, the operative word there is "crazy. " You need to finish your story. Okay, so about a month or so later, I get a call from wade. Yeah, so, you know, terry Janssen's coming back, My gig is up, and I'm thinking, "Hey, you know, maybe it's a sign, "Maybe it's time to shake things up. Move somewhere new, start over. " What's her name? Susie. Wait, "runner-Up" from the party? Yeah. Yeah, that's her. "Kill me now," she said. Oh, Susie's actually a really nice girl, And she thought that you were very pretty. Remind me to send her a thank you note. Anyway, she's moving to Seattle, And I'm going with her, so I figure, "hey, They teach gym everywhere, right?" Is gym really something you teach, Or is it more just a state of mind? Anyway, Susie's getting an apartment, They're not allowed to have pets there, And I thought, yeah, I didn't want to show up with Adam, You know, and it be all awkward, so... Say no more. I'm happy to adopt him. Yes. All right, bud. This is your new home, 'kay? Come on. See? Give me his stuff. Thank you, bales. I knew you'd say yes. Yeah, of course, you did. Bye. And that is how I got Adam, The first of the three loves of my life. But that doesn't explain how you ended up here, In that dress, On a night like this? Please, Louie, geez, Would you just let the girl finish? Sorry, bailey, you go ahead. Well, as great as Adam was, He clearly needed some discipline. Mm. Adam, down. Buddy. Adam. Get down. Somebody's got a mind of his own. Yeah, he just has to learn He can't go after everything he sees. Kind of like his ex-Dad. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Actually, exactly like his ex-Dad. Adam! oh, wow. Hi. This is Adam. Come on, buddy, come here. Oh, wow. Thanks. You know, bales, I've gotta say, I never really thought wade was for you. Yeah. Okay. I know, but I learned from it. What? That fun and cute is not all there is. That, you know, Honesty and loyalty come first. And, while we're at it, Maybe a little more depth, A little more intellect. Well, I was invited to an art opening next week. Travis is coming. Should be crawling With the deep and the brainy. We should go. Okay, good. Which one's your favorite here? Oh, um, yeah, I don't know. They're all pretty unique. Um, what's yours? Well, since I'm a strict disciple Of both abstract expressionism And fantastic realism, I prefer the ink washes and mezzotints. You? Who wants champagne? I'm in. If you'll excuse me for just one moment. Thank you. That was fast. Hmm... I want someone smart, not incomprehensible. Did you hear that? That's funny, because, normally, it's men Who find that women are hard to understand. Maybe if they just paid attention. Is that a crack about us not getting married, Because if it is, I keep telling you, If it's not broken, why break it? How-How to... See? It makes sense. Yeah. I hope that's rhetorical, And on behalf of women everywhere... Like what you see? Um... yes. I like your scarf? thanks. But I meant the art. I'm so glad you meant the art. Um, the art is... uh, what's the word for it? Pretentious? Oh, that might work. Yeah. Are you an artist? Yes, uh, but not this kind. Words are my canvas. Oh, a writer. Mm-Hmm. Playwright, to be exact. Mm-Hmm. I'm Jonathan. Jonathan Mitchell. Bailey. Bailey Daley. How alliterative. Um... no, that would be "bailey Baley. " Yes... or "Dailey Daley. " ...idiot. No, no, I'm so sorry. I'm an English teacher, so... an English teacher? Yeah. Listen, uh... I need to get back to my friends, but... okay. Are you kidding? I- I love jazz. I'm a jazz... nut. Yeah?

What will you play them on, your imaginary turntable? Okay, so... it's kind of just for show. I just, I want to have them. It's very hip and intelligent. Well, in case you forgot, You're already a very intelligent woman. Yes, mom. You tell me to be open to new things? I'm open to new things. Jazz! Mm-Hmm. John Coltrane, If you really want to impress him. Oh, listen to you. oh, I wish you would. Wow! That was sublime. Yeah. You know, I don't meet many women That are into jazz. I don't meet many men Who use the word "sublime. " You want to go somewhere for a drink? Sure. Okay. And... go. Whoa! Good boy. Well done, mate. Wow, you two are getting along. Don't take it personally, though, He likes everyone. Adam should meet eve. Uh, metaphorically speaking? No, eve. My dog. You have a dog named eve? Are you kidding me? What are the odds of that? Well, cheers To Adam and eve. Cheers. She's a good girl. Eve can be a bit moody. Kind of goes her own way, you know? Well, I adore all dogs, so I'm happy to meet her. Miles, Brubeck, Coltrane. Classic. Yeah. I mean, right? It just doesn't get any better. And on vinyl no less. Very cool. Where's your turntable? Let's give them a spin. Um, my, uh, turntable... just completely died last week. It's being fixed. Ah, well, a shame. Another time. Yeah. Salinger, Bronte, dickens... yes, as you know, I teach literature, so... very cool. But I kind of dig the tougher stuff, Thomas Pynchon, James Joyce, Marcel Proust. Talk about deep. So deep. You've read Proust, right? What am I saying? You teach literature. Of course, you have. I'm aching to know where you stand On "in search of lost time. " It's such a huge conversation. Why don't we just save it for next time? Proust? You're kidding. It's amazing. I can't believe I've never read it before. Hmm. Page five. You're really ripping through it. It's one of the most important literary works Of the 20th century, so I'm... said the tall, hot playwright with the dreamy accent. He's also a really good kisser. Hmm. Keep reading. Oh! I want to invite Jonathan over to mom's For Sunday dinner. You and Travis will be there, yes? Don't you think you should go through A few more chapters first? And I'm not talking about the book. It'll be fun. I just want him to meet you guys. Okay. 'Kay. You all right? Yeah. I'm just a little worried About the ending of my new play. Does it work? Not work? I mean, the rest is pretty great, Even if I do say so myself. Well, you wouldn't have to if you'd let me read it. Thanks, but I'd rather you heard it fresh. You know, for the first time at the staged reading next week. It's a writer thing. Okay, well, I'm sure it's brilliant, Including the ending. Well, here's hoping. Hey, speaking of brilliant, Are you ready to rap about Proust? You know, I am re-Reading "in search of lost time," And... it's incredible. Which volume are you on? The first. Okay. Okay, well, we'll wait until you've revisited all seven, And then we'll go at it, You know, page by page. Would you like to come over for dinner At my mom's house on Sunday? It's kind of a weekly ritual with my friends. And I want to meet eve. Unless you have plans. It's... I'm not all that big on... ritual. But, sure... If it means spending it with you. okay, good. Adam and eve sure are getting along. Jonathan, how do you like your roast beef, Medium or rare? Mom, Jonathan's vegetarian. Oh. You know what, I can grill you up some salmon? I do have some frozen. Pretty sure fish is an animal. No, some vegetarians do eat fish, don't they? Pescatarians eat fish. Okay. You're the teacher. Rice and salad will be just fine. Thank you. Okay. When it comes to vegetables, Nothing beats Dina's candied carrots. They're amazing. Yeah, I try to avoid sugar, too. But I will take a roll. Go crazy, pal. Jonathan, tell everyone about your new play. Oh, yes. So exciting. Well, it's called "suffer time. " I'm sorry? - "Suffer time. " - "Suffer time. " Okay, uh... what's it about? Well, uh, dashed hopes, lost dreams, Unrequited love. So it's a comedy? You know, I'd really rather not discuss it, If that's all right. Oh, yeah. Well, everything looks lovely, mom. It's super, as usual, Dina. Hey, Jonathan, after we're done eating, Do you want to watch some football? I think Michigan's gonna crush Penn state! American football's a little rah-Rah for me, But, hey, enjoy. I hope Jonathan enjoyed himself. He seems a little... serious. No, he's just deeper than most guys. And he had a great time, I promise. What about you? You hardly touched your roast beef. I told you, everything was delicious. I'm just trying to be... Trying to be considerate of your new boyfriend. Did you know Vegetarians can live eight years longer Than meat-Eaters? Doesn't matter if a guy lives to be a hundred If he isn't for you. Well, what if he is for me? Look, all I'm saying is just... watch out for those kind of... complicated ones, okay, honey? Okay. Adam... look what I have for you. There's a good boy. Look what I have for you! Want me to pack this up? Yes, please. Thank you. Our fate chooses us. It's not as easy as all that, tom. It's as easy or as hard as you make it, Wouldn't you say? I would say we're just lucky to be alive. Or are we? Lucky? No... alive. Jonathan, hey. You hated it, didn't you? No, I didn't. It was... stunning. Oh, save it, bailey. It stank. You know it, I know it, They certainly know it. You're being way too hard on yourself. You should be proud, you know? You really... You really accomplished something. Seriously? Seriously. You know, you made something... So... special. You're right. It probably just needs a little bit of work. Yeah. Maybe... fill in a few gaps, clean up some dialogue, Maybe even trim a scene or two. Trim. Trim, trim away, yeah. You know, less is more. That's what I tell my students. Thanks, bailey! Less really is more. Hey. Oh. Cheers. To trimming. And genius. So it was really that bad? I'm an English teacher And my boyfriend is a terrible playwright. It's deeply awkward and ironic. At least you didn't twist your ankle this time. No, just the truth. oh. Dinner is ready. Already? Already? It took me two hours. Wow, I had no idea. Oh, well, come taste This delicious, dairy-Free soup I made you. Actually, I'm on a major roll with this rewrite, But you... enjoy.

Um, moved to Seattle, Believe it or not, with... the girl from the party. No. Really? Yes. Truth is stranger than fiction. But I got Adam out of the deal, So, you know, happy ending. Has Adam been asking for a brother or sister yet? Um, he actually has kind of a half-Sister right now. A Dalmatian named eve. Adam and eve? yeah. When her dad, Jonathan, Told me about that, I didn't even believe him. Are Adam and eve close? Yeah, they see quite a bit of each other, So yeah, they're getting there. Hi, sweetheart. Um, so, hey, Is dog food part of the sale? No, but, uh, for you and Adam, I can make an exception. How about 10% off? Okay, 15, but that's my final offer. okay. Well, what can you show me In the way of a nice lamb and rice kibble? Hey! Listen, I have great news! You do? What? I just finished the rewrite. The play is officially done. Congratulations, I can't wait to read it! I can read it, right? Not only can you read it, you can read it right now. But we'll have to be at amber's in 10 minutes... Bailey, I need your opinion. It can't wait. I have to know what I've got. We'll miss the whole party. Why would you want to go to some silly party When you could be making Such an important cultural contribution? All right, I'm confused about something. When I wanted to read your stuff, You protected it from me Like it was some fragile butterfly. When you want me to read your stuff, I have to miss my best friend's birthday party? You wanted an artist, I'm an artist. That's what we do. I wanted someone bright and interesting, Not some moody, self-Absorbed pseudo-Intellectual. "Pseudo?" yeah. I knew things wouldn't work out between us. Look how long it took you to re-Read Proust. I mean, what kind of an English teacher are you? One who loves to read And has never been so bored by a set of books In her life. Are you going to read my play or not? Have you not heard anything I've just said? Actually, I think I've heard more than I needed to. Goodbye, bailey. Goodbye. Don't let the door hit you on the way out. He just left you? Right then and there? Well, it was pretty mutual. But it was okay. I had amber's birthday party to go to, So I had a great time. Atta girl, you had somewhere to go, And you were all dressed up. The guy was a wet blanket. Who needs him? I didn't exactly put on blinders with Jonathan. But I definitely put on some rose-Colored glasses. Honey, sometimes, we just see what we want to see. Is that how you got spot here? Well, remember I told you eve was very moody? Turns out she was more attached to me than I knew. Since we broke up, she's been inconsolable. I didn't know what to do, So I brought her here to see you. Eve... come here. So you'll take her? Uh... to foster, or...? Just until she's back to her old self. I don't know. I mean, she's your dog. Nobody really owns anybody or anything. Besides, Look how much better she already seems With you. So, that's how eve became mine. And once I had her, I wouldn't let her go. Still doesn't explain the dress. Yeah, or little miss Shirley there. Well, now's when it really gets interesting. Oh, hey, I, uh, I hear there's a hot new science sub. Roaming the halls. Want to check that out? No, no. No more serial dating. The next boyfriend will be perfect, Or there will be no boyfriend. Define "perfect" after wade and Jonathan. Mm... balanced, together, Knows what he wants, Knows who he wants... Of course, and with the face and body of a god. yes. Let's get fit. Oh, hey, want to go power-Hiking With Adam and eve? Mm... let's do yoga. Yoga, hmm... and continue in our downward dog, Hips up to the ceiling, Shoulders away from your ears, Feet hip-Width apart. I've never seen a dog in this position, Downward or otherwise. This is fun, shh. - No. - No? It's not fun. And coming into plank pose... lower to chaturanga... and into upward-Facing dog. Beginners? What gave us away? On a scale of 1 to 10, how are we doing? Oh, uh, solid 7. Nice. Don't worry, You'll be "upward dogging" with the best in no time. Now, we're going to stay here And take a full three breaths. No. Good work, ladies. You're now officially yoga survivors. I'm Eric Strang, by the way. I'm bailey. Amber. So, Eric, uh, Will we see you next week at this class? Uh, if I'm not driving golf balls. I usually switch off with yoga, so... oh, I love golf. You do? Yeah. You should see her slam around that little ball. She shows it no mercy. She's exaggerating a little bit. Yeah? Okay, well, why don't you show me? Why don't you meet me at the driving range Next Saturday morning, Over on briar there. We'll knock out a few buckets. Maybe I will. Okay. Well, nice meeting you. You do know He's talking about big boy golf, right? Not the windmill, loop-De-Loop kind? How hard can it be? Right. Oh... Kay. Uh, I told you that amber exaggerated. No worries. Hey, I'm just glad you're here. So, I am not an expert, But, uh, can I give you some advice, about golf? "Keep my day job?" "Don't go pro. " Both of those are accurate. No, I downloaded this app just in case, Just to help you here. Um, so see this guy? See what he's doing there with the follow through? It's all about the follow through. Right? Okay. Okay, so watch me here. You want to, uh, Try to think of the club As like a whip. You want to whip through the ball And then follow through. The key is the follow through, right? Nice. It was all right. Why don't you give it a go? okay. Whip through the ball, follow through. Okay. Following through. Is that...? Oh. Whoops. That's all right, we got this. Okay, grab another ball, And, um... that's good. Okay, so take the position again. Okay... now, just relax, And remember the follow through, And nice and easy swing. Give it a shot. Okay. Following... through. There we go! I told you amber was exaggerating. No, what are you talking about? I'm just glad we did this. It was fun. It was fun. It was more fun than yoga, I must say, And less painful. Well, I don't know about that. I've had a few four-Putts that were pretty painful. Yeah? So, I didn't even ask, what do you do? Oh, I'm in retail. What about you? I'm in high school. uh, I teach high school English... I can hardly speak it. Well, English, that's good Because I speak English. There you go. You want some help? Let me help you. Sure, thank you. Um... let me... there you go. Yeah, a good book, a glass of wine, Roaring fire, I'm a pretty happy guy. Nice. Have you ever read "In search of lost time" by Proust? By who? That is actually the correct answer. Please forget that I mentioned it. Okay, I'm glad I passed that one, Whatever that was. I'm sorry. Okay. Well, uh... we should do this again... Not golf, but a proper date. I would like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay then. Um... phone number? So, of course, I am miss golf klutz of the year, But Eric is so kind, And he's so patient, and so sweet, That, by the end of it, I kind of knew what I was doing. Well, I certainly hope so. You hope so how? Honey, do you remember when you were seeing wade? Do you remember what I said to you? You said to stop seeing wade. No. no. The point is, any guy would be lucky to have you, Whether you run marathons, eat meat, or play golf. Oh, Eric downloaded this app for me That shows me a perfect golf swing Start to finish. It's so helpful. Hmm, and thoughtful, And presumptuous. Oh, my gosh, mom... What? I saved the best for last. Listen, I googled him. Yeah? He's Eric Strang of Strang's fashion salons. What? V.P. Of business development. Okay. Okay, so he's the heir Of a highly successful national chain Of high-End clothing stores, But he is still just a guy. A clearly solid, responsible, ambitious guy. Mm-Hmm. Bailey, Do you like Eric? I think he's pretty great. Okay, so then, at this point in time, There's really one other thing That should matter to you. What? Where does he stand on dogs? So, Adam here is the sweetest, happiest boy ever, And eve is, uh, she's more serious, She's kind of anxious. Yeah... do you like dogs? Uh, truth? I've never really been a big dog person. Okay, you've not met the right one, clearly. Here, try this guy on for size. Okay... Here we go... Oh. All right. Hey, who's walking who there? What do I do? Just-Just stop. Okay. okay. Phew! Here. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Yes, sir. Okay. He's actually calmed down quite a bit Since I've had him. Calmed down? Really, that's, uh... you must have had your work cut out for you. Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of work, you said you were in retail. Turns out, you are retail. I googled. Couldn't resist. Yeah, well, When you're a Strang, There's no escaping the family business. Not that I'd want to, though. I mean, it's the best job in the world. It's creative, it's challenging, it's purposeful. It's great. You're a lucky guy. Well, I met you, didn't I? You want to sit down? Yeah. Here, boy. okay... Oh. Oh, wow. All right. Okay. Okay, down, boy. He's a lover. What's the... What do I say? I don't know. I don't know how to stop it. I never tried. Uh, he is a good kisser, I'll say that. okay, okay... here, I think I have... I guess I'm not so much good with drool either. Oh, well... how am I doing? I think you're all right. I've got... yeah. Thank you. Hi! Hi, you! Oh, my goodness, let me see your face. Oh... you think any of these dogs have papers? Probably not. It's not about pedigree, it's a rescue, you know? Hey, you guys. This fella here could use a good home. Hey, Cole. How's it going? Wait, is this the famous eve? This is the one. Hi! Hi. Which, wait, should make you Jonathan, yes? Oh. Nope. Um... so, eve was Jonathan's, And now she's mine, And this is Eric. Um, babe, this one is so cute. Did you see the little face on this one? What kind of dog is he? Oh, he's a little of this, a little of that. Do you have one That's a lot of all of one thing, or..? Around here, all dogs are created equal. Babe, look at his face. He's a sweet potato. Look at his face! Yup. I know, but I gotta think about it. Okay. Look, if I come across a purebred, I can give you a shout. Okay. It's like buying a car, I want to look around. It's so not like buying a car. It's like choosing a member of your family. It's about love. It is. Come on, fella. You're really special, you know that? Thanks. So are you. Thank you. So, now that my parents are back from their world cruise, I really want you to meet them. I would love to. When? It's all set. A Sunday brunch, At my mom and dad's country club. A country club, that's swanky. It's just a place they've belonged to forever. My grandparents, too. It's kind of like a Strang tradition thing. Yeah? Does that include you? Uh, married couples only. Ah-Hah. Believe it or not. An old bylaw. This way. But I am hoping to become a member At some point. Mm-Hmm. Hey, you! Bailey, what's your pleasure, prosecco or champagne? Oh, um... champagne. If it's okay with everyone else. A bottle of Cristal, 2004. Might I suggest the 2006? It was a better growing season. I'm in your capable hands, Ernesto. Well, bailey, Tell us, what is it you do again? Oh, I'm an English teacher. At Parkview high. Parkview high? Isn't that a public school? Yes. Yes, it is. Oh. Well. Isn't that nice? Teaching is a noble profession. We need more teachers. And what do your people do? Grandma, That's a little personal. No, that's fine. Um, my father died about 10 years ago, He managed A valu-Mart downtown, And my mother works for a dentist. Oh, hygienist? Receptionist. Well... where would we be Without the gatekeepers? Am I right? Absolutely. She runs that office like a well-Oiled machine. Look, I know they're a little formal, But they've been great parents. And my grandmother, She's always been there for me. Well, they seemed very nice. I just hope they liked me. Are you kidding me? They loved you. Really? What makes you so sure? Because I love you. Why are we stopping? I want you to see something. Take a look. Who lives here? Do you like it? It's beautiful. Yeah, I've had my eye on it for a while. To buy? It's kind of a big house, though, For just one person, don't you think? It's kind of a big house For my entire tenth grade English class. I mean, it has, like, its own little forest. And the stonework out in front, it's amazing, And then the house is so huge. It's like a log cabin crossed with a castle. Ooh. Yeah, well, first things first, honey. I mean, Eric hasn't even asked you to marry him. The way he's been acting lately, He may as well have an engagement ring Taped to his forehead. Hmm, and is that a good thing? He's all I've ever wanted In someone. Okay, but do you love him? Oh, my gosh, this is so perfect! Two purebreds just came in for adoption At Cole's pet shop, And it's Eric's birthday coming up. You won't find a better dog. We never get full-Bred labs for rescue. Lab, that's like a golden retriever, right? Like Adam? Yeah. Yeah, uh... Adam is a bit, um... too active for me maybe. And, uh, he's a bit wet. There you go. Well, this is Sam, He's a wire-Haired jack Russell. He's a super little dude. Terriers are pretty High strung, though, From what I've read. They're pretty much As high strung as whoever raises them. Okay, buddy. But they shed, too, right? Well, most dogs do. Know why? They're dogs. Well, uh... let me sleep on it, okay? Don't sleep too long. Dogs like these, they go fast. I so wanted you to have a dog For your birthday. I know. I don't know what could be keeping Eric. He did say he had a surprise. The only surprise is that he's not here yet, And I am starving. Surprise! oh, my gosh! Who's this? - Who is this? - It's my dog. Mother picked her out. Oh, I thought we'd do that together? Oh, come on, what's the big deal? I didn't actually pick her out. I have an acquaintance at the club Who shows dogs, and wins trophies and such, And I asked her to recommend a small dog With good breeding. It's a shih Tzu. They don't shed. They're hypo-Allergenic. And the breeder promises That hers rarely bark. Never, if properly trained. What's her name? Uh, Balthazar's imperial belle, According to her papers. Oh, fancy schmancy. Oh, belle? Oh, I don't think so. No, I think you're more of a Shirley. Shirley? Mm-Hmm. That's my late sister's name! Oh, how nice is that? Then you can think of her every time you see the dog. I really don't think I would want an animal Named after my sister. Oh, now, mother, hush. It's Eric's dog, He can name it whatever he wants. Shirley it is. Shirley it is. To Shirley. To Shirley. To Shirley. Aw... oh, watch the furniture, dear. Oh. Okay. Yeah, let's just... Dinner was delicious, Mrs. Strang, thank you. Yes. Oh, well, I wish I could take all the credit for it, But the credit goes to Sybil. I don't know what I would do without her. You could start by learning to light the stove. That's enough wine, mother. Sybil, dear, Will you, uh, help me in the kitchen? Please? I am so glad that both of you are here To help celebrate my birthday. I second that. Count me in. And I would like to thank you For welcoming us into your home. You can thank me. I paid for it. Happy birthday, sweetheart! Look at that! Oh, thanks, mom. That is beautiful. Happy birthday. Thank you so much. Phew. Um, bailey, Okay. Okay... oh, my, this could feed an army. You better be hungry. What is this? This is... tonight's real surprise. Open it. Bailey Daley, Will you marry me? yes! yes. Yes. These are just some of the dresses That we sell at Strang's. My personal favorite... oh, wow. Is the one with pearl beads And a high-Neck bodice. Tres elegant. You'd look amazing in that, bailey. You have to get it. Oh, it's gorgeous, I just... I'm sure I could not afford this. Oh, no, listen, dear, Like I've told you before, Eric's father and I, We're handling everything, So not to worry. And that's an order. Oh, and that you wear Grandmother Strang's ruby earrings As your "something old. " Yes. Oh, I was going to wear these little pearl earrings That my dad gave me for my 10th birthday. Pearl? But, honey, these are ruby. They're one of a kind. You couldn't even buy them today. Mm-Hmm. No, they'll be perfect. You'll look beautiful. So, our table should be immediate family only, Of course. Wait, what about amber and Travis? Uh, amber and Travis can sit... here... with my assistant, and her mother, And my cousins from Newport. Wait, but they don't know those people. Well, now they will. All right, why are we even doing this right now? We haven't sent out invitations? We don't know who's coming. Oh, I'm just getting a head start On my timeline. You have a timeline? Oh, yeah. I have scheduled every single thing We need to do for the wedding, In order, from a to z. Takes out all the guesswork. Look at this. Oh, wow. It takes out all the surprise, too, huh? Exactly. Hi, eve. No, no, no, no! Oh... bailey, come on... why-Why aren't you... Eve... Okay. Why aren't you training them? Because they're dogs. Because we're at the park and they're being dogs. Well then, they should be on a leash at all times. No, they should not. And look at Shirley, she doesn't run around. What about that? I mean... no, I know, this is... this is what she's doing. This is who she is. You know, all dogs are different. Well, at least she doesn't slobber all over everyone. I mean, do you know how many germs Are in a dog's mouth? How many things you can get from them? All kinds of stuff... Nope, zero. Look it up. Okay... you know what, bailey, Sometimes, I think you care more about dogs Than you do about people. You really don't like dogs, do you? They're not my thing. They're your thing, bailey. I told you that, remember? And Shirley... yeah, I got her just for you. You know, if you can't understand my love of dogs, Then you can't understand me. What does one thing have to do with another? I think if I have to explain that... I don't know, we should be... we should reconsider what we're doing here. Reconsider? What do you mean, reconsider? What are you talking about? Reconsider what? Bailey... I'm gonna go. What do you mean, you're going to go? Where are you going to... Shirley, come here. Bailey... good girl. Watch your head, Adam. Don't just leave, let's talk about this. I don't know what else there is to say. Listen, you basically think That my priorities are all out of whack, But you're missing what makes me. No, you're wrong. I know exactly what that is, and it's fine, really. "Fine?" "Fine" is like something you say about the weather. It's not how you talk about someone that you love. Bailey, just... please, just tell me what you want. I want Shirley. What? Come here, girl. You can't just take Shirley. You just told me that you got her only for me. Besides, no dog should live where they're not welcome. Eric. Why didn't he just tell me That he didn't want a dog in the first place? It would have saved us so much time and trouble. I think he did, Just not in a way you were hearing. Mm. To be fair, I haven't been completely honest with him. I said "yes" to getting married when I really meant, "maybe. " Well, now that we're actually talking about this, Why did you? Because men like Eric don't grow on trees. I think we can agree on that. No offense to Travis. None taken. I wish Travis had half of Eric's interest In marriage. There is such a thing As too much of a good thing, you know. You know, on our first date, When Eric brought those pictures of the perfect golf swing, I thought, "look, this guy is super-Prepared. " But... a bit of overkill, right? Good. That doesn't have to be a deal-Breaker. Just keep it in check. Everyone's got something. Speaking of too much of a good thing... mm-Mm. If I must. Oh, good girls, Safely crossing the street. Cole, hey. Bailey, hey! So, whatever happened with your boyfriend's dog? I never heard from you. Oh, uh... Whoa, who's this? This is Eric's... My shih Tzu. Shirley. Shirley the shih Tzu? Sweet! Though he didn't seem like the little dog type. No, he's not, really. He's not the "any dog" type. He just got her for me, so... well, you gotta love that, right? Uh, I do? Taking in a dog is a huge deal. If someone went to that kind of trouble for me, I'd be like, "what are you doing the rest of your life?" Even if she didn't really love dogs? As long as she really loved me, I'd figure it out... Provided I loved her back, of course. Right. But, you know, I'm a little pie-In-The-Sky about all that stuff. Yeah, I thought I was, too. Hey, watch this. Adam, catch. Oh! Good catch. Okay, there you go. Good girl. Here, you want to try. Sure, here, take Shirley. I'll hold the dogs, and... okay, okay, sit. Wait, wait... He's inching closer and closer. Oh, good catch! Cool, well, next time, We'll kick it up a notch with tennis balls. Oh, my, we'll have our work cut out for us. Shirley... aw, great dog. Yeah, she is. It was good to see you. You too. Come on. Come on, we're going to go home now. That is not the end of the story. Is it? How could it be the end of the story? We still don't know why She's wearing that wedding dress! Oh, thank you. Look who just got his second wind. Continue, please. Well, the next few days were pretty emotional. Eric kept calling. I couldn't answer the phone... okay, easy, guys. Come on. We've got to let Shirley keep up with us. Come on. Come on, Shirley girl. Oh, I know, hey, we're so close. Hi. I wanted to see Shirley, and give her these. Oh. Well... Come here, Shirley. Wow, I didn't know she, uh, Likes tulips. Except maybe to nibble on. Yeah, what was I thinking? Do you know what, I have an idea, Would you like to have them? I guess I'd hate to see them go to waste. Here. Trade? Yeah. I got her. So, how is Shirley? Ask her yourself. Hey, girl, how you doing? Huh? She seems good. Yeah, she is good. that's all right. She's loosened up a bit, you know. Adam has that effect on other dogs. Yeah? Yeah. Bailey, I have to say something. I may not... love dogs as much as you do, but... I do love you. How much? Very, very much. And I'm... I'm just hoping you still love me, too. I do. I love you very much. - You do? - I do. This is really great, you know why? why? Because according to my schedule, We still can send out the invitations in time And make our original wedding date. That is good news. I know. Invitations, check. Cake, check... Wait, did we decide on A lemon cake with vanilla frosting, Or the vanilla cake with lemon frosting? What? No, no, neither. We chose the raspberry black satin fudge cake. No, you chose that one. I said something lighter would be nice. But, babe, that black satin cake, I mean, that makes a statement. And, don't forget, That's chef Dubois' signature dessert. Okay, photographer, check. Videographer, check. Waltz lessons, waltz lessons... We still have to schedule those. Okay, so, Let's talk about the waltz. I'm envisioning something different For our first dance. Look, bailey, we Strangs are a family of Waltzers. I mean, this has been a wedding tradition For, like, forever! You'll love it, you'll see. Music, check. Wedding dress, check. Amber's dress, check. Uncheck. She's really... She's not into the whole suit thing. So, one of those other options that we looked at, The lighter-Colored ones? Yeah, but the whole point Was for her dress to match the roses in the centerpieces, So, I'm sorry, that one's not negotiable. got those. Haircuts... did I get a haircut? Yes, I did. Bailey, for Pete's sake, You have to stop shaking, I cannot get this dress zipped up. It's so cold. Isn't it freezing in here? Mm-Mm, no, it's actually really warm. The only thing that's freezing are the daiquiris. Okay, there, how's that? Oh, so tight. It's so much tighter than it was. I can't really breathe. Honey, it fits you perfectly. You look wonderful. Okay... and done. Thanks. Okay. Gorgeous. Thanks. I am so sorry... about the suit. Ah... Okay, um, I'm going to go downstairs and find Travis. Okay, no, I promise I won't cry until after. Yeah. You look so gorgeous. Oh, bailey... you look gorgeous. Thanks. Bye. She's right, you know, You're the prettiest bride ever. Oh, I don't know about that. I've seen your pictures. How are you feeling, honey? Besides the fact that I can't really breathe And I might pass out? I'm good. Yeah, I'm good. I so wish your father was here to see this. He would have been so proud of you. When did you know that he was... you know, the one? You know what, It was actually When we were standing up there About to get married. I looked at him Like I had never seen him before, And I just knew, He was my soulmate. And he would love me for exactly who I was, And me, him, come rain or shine. Have I ever told you You're the best mom in the world? You don't have to. okay. All right. Beautiful, are you ready To become Mrs. Eric Strang? I'll be out in one minute. I love you. I love you, too. What do you guys think? Am I doing the right thing? Is Eric my soulmate, come rain or come shine? Am I his? I'm talking to dogs. Okay. let's get married! Dear friends and family, We are gathered here today To witness and celebrate The joining of bailey and Eric In holy matrimony. And do you, bailey, Take Eric To be your lawfully wedded husband? For better or for worse, For richer, for poorer, In sickness and in health, To love, and to cherish Till death do you part? n- No. No, I... No, I don't. I'm... Eric, I'm so sorry. What are you doing? I wanted to be Who you want me to be, But I'm... I'm not that person. We can't... do it like that. Bailey, what are you talking about? You know you don't believe that. Now, just, come on, get it together, and... I really believe that. Any woman would be so lucky To be standing here with you, But you've had this whole thing planned out, You know, your whole life planned out, And it just... It wasn't my plan. What are you... I'm so sorry. Come here. Come on. So, I guess... I just realized, you know, That I can't find the right man By trying to be the right woman for him. I just have to be... you know, you have to be true to yourself, And then the rest falls into place, hopefully. That's beautiful, bailey. See, he's just a big softie after all. Aw... You two really love each other, don't you? Yeah, we're, uh, we're pretty inseparable. Yeah, and not just because of this joint, either. Oh, honey... I hope to someday have what you have. You know what, sweetie, I was just about your age when I started working here. I would stand behind that counter every day, Waiting for my prince charming To come walking through the door. Guys came in, and guys went out, And guess what? There was not a single prince among them. and then, one day, Right outta the blue, This one says to me, "How about we go out sometime?" And I'm like, "go out where?" He's like, "on a date, dummy!" And pretty much The rest is history. ancient history. you speak for yourself. The point is, honey, Sometimes... Sometimes, those answers are right in front of us. We just have to open up our eyes And see them. a kind and beautiful woman once told me "Dogs love unconditionally. "If you find someone who can love you like a dog, You just may have found true love. " Cole? Hi, bailey. Good story. You've been sitting there the whole time? Oh, honey, he's here every night. Really. Till closing and sometimes after. Sitting over there, hunched over a book. You know this guy? Yeah. Why didn't you say something? I don't know, I guess I just enjoyed Hearing the sound of your voice. Ah... Okay, I'm... I'm still kind of embarrassed, actually, About everything I told you At that party. Are you kidding? That was beautiful. Besides, I've had the biggest, baddest crush on you Ever since. Okay, so now you've heard all of that... what can I say? I'm a goner. Why didn't you ever ask me out? You were always seeing someone, or breaking up with someone, And it wouldn't have been right. That's so not who I am. I really have never dated around much. It's just been... It's a crazy time. Well, I think you're great, just the way you are. here we go. That was quite the story. well, yeah. So... where are you going now? Um... I don't know. I'm not tired, though. Well, how would you and the dogs Like to meet my new beagle, flapjack? A beagle? Oh, boy. I think we'd like that. Cool. Which way? All right. You must be freezing. Adam... good boy.
