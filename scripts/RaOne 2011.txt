Dude. No, dad. Its dude. Like, dude with attitude. Dude. Okay. A brand new game A new hero... Heroes bore I hate heroes. Heroes are boring. Old or new Don't you like heroes? Do you prefer villains? Yes. Villains are awesome. They have no rules They just win. Anyone comes in their way...bam! You be careful. Take my advice. Make a game with a villain who never loses You are speaking absolute nonsense. The hero always win Truth and goodness win Yes right, dad. Just like you. My father, my hero. Prateek. Don't be a smartypant. Allow me to quote.. ..Late Mr. V. Shantaram. "Tread the right path" "Combat evil, so with a smile... you die" Good night, dad. - What goodnight? The discussion is not over. One slap. One, one.. Shekar. I will give him one. Shekar. V. Shantaram? Yes, really. Really. V. Shantaram. Right. Goodnight, honey. Okay. I will have all the noodles and curd by myself.

Prateek, come here Come, come, come. Dad. You know I don't do that. Yeah. Okay. I want to tell you something You like villains? I'll make you a villain... mightier than the hero He'll never lose You like that, don't you? Give me your hand. But never forget, Prateek Evil is wicked and bad Allow me to quote myself: "Sell your soul to the Devil and evil's shadow won't leave you" Shadow. Means "shadow" Whatever? Whatever is good. World's bad villain. Today's lesson is on LAN. Local Area Network. Who's Lucifer? When I play video games... my gaming name is Lucifer WLAN. Wireless LAN. Allows interconnectivity between computers. Ms. Boyle can log on to our computers Now I will seek connection to all of your computers. So then monitor appears on this projection. She'll ask for permission. We say no Fatso says yes I've hacked and he is jacked. And I am sending the invitation now. Let's see who will be the first person to accept my request. Billy. Thank you, Billy, for accepting my invitation. Let's see what Billy has to share. Billy, out. I have a great idea for our new video game We'll create... the mightiest... Hero. Villain. Villain? Yes, villain. But, why? Because, Jenny. Villains are awesome. What do you say, Akashi. For Prateek, right? Yes Of course. "Joy will last longer than grief. Don't lose hope. " "If we are together.. " "..why to feel afraid during the journey?" "With wings beneath our feet." "You and I will fly away. " "Walk along with joy. " "If the path is open, regardless of where we meet... the destination will begin from there. " "Walk along with joy. " "If the path is open, regardless of where we meet... the destination will begin from there. " "Don't worry about a thing now. Because I will be right by your side. I will be right by your side. " "Don't worry about a thing now. Because I will be holding you tight. I will be holding you tight. " "Don't worry about a thing now. Because I will be right by your side. I will be right by your side. " "Don't worry about a thing now. Because I will be holding you tight." Okay, boys and girls. A name for our villain? We can't keep calling him "Random Access Version One?" We have to think of some good name. Dracula. No, no. you. Raaka. Guys, guys. It's staring you in the face Meaning? Random Access Version One. "Ra.One" - What's that? - Raavan! The demon Raavan? A modern day Raavan Wild idea! I like Ra. One it is very dangerous. What about the hero's name? Hero's name. "G.One?" Good one. G.One means "life" Ra. One = danger. G.One = life Hi. Come on. Come on. Okay. "If your dreams are hiding somewhere. " "If you are hesitating to take a step. " "I will make your dreams come true in an instant." "I will again adorn it in the sky, beyond the stars. " "The sorrows that are in my life, I will convert it into joy for you. " "Walk along with joy. " "If the path is open, regardless of where we meet... the destination will begin from there. " "Walk along with joy. " Just like Jackie Chan. It's working. "Don't worry about a thing now. Because I will be right by your side. I will be right by your side. " A birthday gift "Don't worry about a thing now. Because I will be right by your side. I will be right by your side. " - What's up? - The hero must have a face "I will be holding you tight. Don't worry about a thing now. Because I will be right by your side. I will be right by your side. " "Don't worry about a thing now. Because I will be holding you tight." He's spectacular Terrific smile I didn't program a smile Didn't you? Why is he smiling? Is he learning things by himself? Okay. Now everyone look closely. The game's main part The HAR As in "heart?" Not heart. Always talking romantic. Not that heart, the HART is Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter. It gives the players their power As the players go from level to level... the HART'S power increases, the colour intensifies And now...let me come to the most interesting part. If the HART is not connected to G.One and Ra. one... you cannot destroy them If you destroy the HART, they won't die No, no, sir. Destroy their bodies, they won't die either Connect them to their HARTs then destroy them When does that happen? Only on level three. The players get an anti-HART gun with one bullet The first to hit the target wins The player who misses... So the HART is their strength? And weakness? Let me also be... Allow me to be as romantic as Jenny. "A hero isn't made of muscle or metal "A superhero is made or undone by his heart alone" Wow. Great. See? The movie villain lost, the hero won. Very good. I like. That's why the film bombed. The villain was cool Not cool. A bloody fool, a chain-smoker Smoking kills This kid is smoking Let's go - I must talk to him Hey little boy. Little boy. Let's go. Your Mom knows you smoke? Sure! I see. But she doesn't know I kill With a fork? - A nail cutter - A knife He's flashing a knife. And he isn't a small child either. Dad, don't worry. We can smash his teeth in Your wallet! Of course, sir. Of course. Give him a slap Sorry, sir. Here's the money, sir. Plus a tip A slap, please! Slap. What else do you have? That's all I have, sir I gave you everything I had, sir. Don't move Yes, sir. - You haven't seen me. Now count to 2000 Good number sir. That's my lucky number. Don't slip on the wet road, sir. Goodnight, sir. See? I scared him off But he might return. Start counting. Good practice Yeah right, dad. 1000.. Prateek. Prateek, wait You didn't even fight back. You coward No, Prateek. I'm not a coward I didn't hit him because he could've hurt you Allow me to quote the great Mahatma Gandhi.. .."An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind" I'm no coward, Prateek I am.. Hey..
