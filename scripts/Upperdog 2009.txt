On 17 April 2008, - -my team and I took part in an operation outside Meymaneh. We were on observation in the Western part of the province. We'd set up camp and posted guards. At 22:15 hours I was informed of a possible IED in a white Mercedes. In addition to us, Susanne Holmboe, a journalist from VG, had come along. Holmboe claimed she had clearance and joined us at her own risk. Four of us prepared a roadblock on the main road. I stood guard on the other side of the camp. He'd been hit in the neck. Get out! Get out! Get out! He was later taken to hospital, where he died. I completed the final month of my tour of duty. Down! Down! Down! Get down! Get down! Two days after my return, a picture is published on the front page of VG. In my opinion, this picture is the reason why I'm standing here today. I acted according to instructions. Hi. Did you forget the yoga? It's so quiet here. You know, I have to move. I can hear my neighbour brush his teeth. My new boss- - wants me to pay 8,000 per month, and that's with discount. My new boss wants me to walk her dog. Pay someone to walk your dog! His name is Fluffy. But he's white, and more "Puffy", I have to say. A white poodle. We went to the Vigeland Park. Those statues are amazing! Like Russian miners, only smaller, angrier and weaker. What makes the shot great, is the boy's bravery. He won't give up. It's really nice. Truly excellent. But maybe we could try a slightly different shade of red? -What were you thinking of? -Something brighter? -Like pussy pink? -Are you starting again? I'm talking about a colour. Don't you know what "pussy" means? Don't we agree that he can't say that to me? Aren't you the boss? Trude's right. Apologise. You must have seen the colour of what she's got down there? -I'm telling Ms. Hemse. -No, please don't. Axel's giving me lip again! Ann broke up with me this morning. I'm moving back home to my parents. What do you want me to do about it? A back rub would be nice. I think you'll have to work from home until you sort out your vocabulary. Hi. Right... Weve got something to celebrate. -That's nice. -Yes, but we don't have much time. Let's see... She'll be here in 45 minutes. The pictures looked okay. Is this an okay neighbourhood? Maybe you don't Ive here? -But you've got some impression? -It's not the west side. He's my son. He's going to study at the university. -It's going to be great. Really fine. -Mother... I'm sorry. Just pretend I'm not here. Would you like something to drink? Champagne. -Well, I just... -Okay. It's finally over now. Hi. You're here to look at the flat? Well, we can just step inside. It's in here. -How many people live here? -Weve expanded into the basement. The housing market is boiling these days. We've got 114 tenants here now. There. Maybe well let him in first, as he's going to live here. Go ahead. These used to be offices. Well, everything seems to be in order here. -It looked different on the webpage. -In what way? Well, not that cramped. Lighter. Right, shall we sign the contract? -Hi. I'll just leave it here. -Sure, no problem. Fluffy! When will she earn not to shit in our garden? Good to see you. Could you go wipe it up? -Me? It's not my dog. -No, but I'm cooking, right? Well done, Axel! -Hi, mom. -Hi. -Good to see you. -You too. So you got a friend to seduce her to see if she was faithful? -That's how it's done these days. -How childish! It's not easy for him. Ann cheated on me. We broke up. I wasn't planning to marry the twat. I'll take some time off from work. I'll be okay. It's alright to feel hurt when you've been betrayed. -You don't entrap your girlfriend. -He didn't entrap her. I wouldn't call it entrapment. It's more a test. I didn't trust her, quite simply. It's important that you trust your intuition. Prove it right. -See you. -Be home for the hunt? -Sure, bye. -Goodbye. -Hi. -Hello. No. I just washed the floor! For sure, it's the mafia. They always have blood under their shoes. -Hello? -Hi. Hey, could you do us a favour? Could we leave some material here? -What does he say? -It's just some flyers. Yeah. We want our soldiers home from Afghanistan. People are dying. It's important that Norwegians get the message, do something about it. -But... You don't have a fag? -No, I'm afraid not. -What does he want? -Cigarettes. -Thanks. -You're welcome. -Goodbye. -Bye. "Bring the soldiers home." I wouldn't mind bringing those two home. My turn to annoy the neighbours. Hello? Hi. Why aren't you in bed yet? I see. Is grandma asleep? No. Goodbye. Bye. I miss him so much. Okay. Let's turn on the music again. -I'll call the police. -I'm the son in the house. They told me nothing about a son. They only told me about a dog. You don't look like them. You're Chinese. Yes, I'm from Asia. You see that picture on the Wal? Just... -It's from the first time I met them. -The small one, it's you? Yes. Adoption. I guess you can't afford that in Russia. I'm from Poland. You don't have to be rude. I'm sorry. -I'm Maria. -Good for you. Thank you. -Would you like some coffee? -No thanks. On the house? But the food was good. What are you reading? Philosophy and science history. Ive been admitted to the university. Philosophy. Have you taken it? Yanne? Ive got news for you. At my boss' house, there's a picture of a boy. It looks like yours. -But it's not the same. -What? In my boss' house there's a picture on the wall, of a boy. And he looks like that boy. The small one. Your brother. Yes. Now I'm 100% sure. But the framing is different. They've changed the picture. You're not there. -For some reason. -It's not so strange. I'm just his half sister. What was he like? Kind of attractive. But not nice. Not a gentleman. No, I mean... Did he seem happy? He thinks he's happy, but he's not. Don't you miss him? Axel? Could you go and fetch a poop bag? Yanne? Yanne! Listen... I want you to leave him a one. Don't tell him anything. He thinks he's happy. He looks happy. Is my little girl hiding here? Mommy. Mommy! Are you hiding in the closet again? Hello? Oh my god! My son was baptised in that church! -You have a family? -Yes, I have a son. He lives with my parents While I'm here. Look! It's not so beautiful. Quite ugly. But that was the style in the 80s. Don't you have work to do? -Why are you so rude? -Maybe I'm evil. Maybe you're stupid- - to Ive with your parents, though you're grown-up. I gave up my job to spend time with our beautiful maid. So you think sitting at your parents' house is better than manual labour? Maybe. Pleased to meet you... Wonderboy. Pleased to meet you too. Bye! That a journalist may be dangerous, specially if she's young and fair. Any Kabul bookseller knows that. But that a dead cat - -can blow your buddies to shreds, that takes some getting used to. Over there you must remember that nothing is what it seems. A child. A car. A woman. -What's she doing here? -Two Bravo, over. Everythings a potential threat. There was a hearing, you know. Why didn't you write about my acquittal? -I'm no longer on the story. -Look at this. It wasn't like that. You used this to become famous. You know it well. No, I don't know it well. How can you keep these on your wall? I was just doing my job. I'd really like to join you. We need more outdoor shots of you as well. No more shots from the shower? If there's any trouble, you can say I claimed I'd received the guarantee. You want me to lie? Hold it there for a while. Amazing. Like this? And sideways. -You can't blame me for finding him. -Only if you tell him about me. -Maybe he knows? -Just don't ask. Tell me why, and I'll keep my mouth shut. -Promise? -Promise. First of all, We don't have the same father. Secondly, our Norwegian parents- -agreed that they wouldnt keep in touch. And thirdly... My brother's father, he was a terrible man. And our mother had to suffer because of him. Who wants to remember that? Could you pass me the soy? But what about you? Did you agree that you should forget each other? They never asked me. Maybe it's not your problem? Hi! Aren't you going to come in and get in my way a bit? They're fresh. -Hello, Maria. -Hi. I made the meatballs. -Do you like them? -Yeah. See you later. Maria? All the way... Axel? Say hello to Liv. Remember Liv? -Yes, of course I remember Liv. -He's handsome. His eyes have become so beautiful. Hi. Have you had cake? Look at him, in his suit. You know he used to play in a punk band? Now he's a snob like the rest of us. -So what are you telling her? -That you're afraid of being seen- - without your white shirt. -That's not my impression. May I have your attention, please? It's the birthday of my dear Fredrik. Happy birthday. All you in the dining room, please come in here. Because now we're going to sing the birthday song. Is everybody ready? One, two, three... Hi. You look fresh to Ive in this place. -I've just moved in. -I'm Maria. -Per. -Are you a photographer? Well, no. I'm a student. Ive just bought the camera. I'm studying philosophy. I'm a student too. I'm studying Norwegian behaviour. -And what have you found out? -Well... The Norwegians are sad. They're hurting inside. And hard, like statues in a park. And some are naked. Bye. Unwanted in a foreign country? Yes, it's a frightening feeling. -Is it easy to loose your bearings? -Hi, mom. Hi, we're listening to a programme on the radio. It's from Afghanistan. I'm listening to it as well. But thanks. Its very interesting. But... There's another thing. Karsten... He wanted to come and visit you in Oslo. Is that okay? Yes, that'll be fine. Are you all right? -Sure. -See you at the hunt. -Well, bye. -Bye. Activists are mobilising against the war, and plan a demonstration - - in connection to the NATO meeting. Any thoughts? I think... they've no idea what theyre talking about. Afghanistan is complex... Its not about war or peace. Its just not possible to withdraw overnight. Karsten! Hi. -Shall I take it? -Yeah. -This much stuff? -Mom's packed it, you know. So it's the entire weekend? -There sure are many beggars here. -Yeah, there sure are. Drug addicts as well. You haven't tried drugs, have you? No, I haven't. So you don't know anyone Who smokes hash? No. -Did you hear that? -What? A woman screaming in the street. -Karsten, it's normal city sounds. -But what if she's being kidnapped? Want me to check? -Nobody's being kidnapped here. -Can't you move back home to us? -Don't you have any friends here? -Shall I read you a bedtime story? -You've got lots of shots of a lady. -You been poking through my stuff? I wanted to show her what if felt to be paparazzied and hung out to dry. Is this the photographer? He was a king, was October. I was a princess. They lived among roses, knew not the storm of the perfectly simple. They lived among roses, knew not the storm of the perfectly simple. But the terrible fate, the cruel... -Think Fluffy needs to go for a walk. -Okay. Right now. -You do it. I have to finish this. -It's your job. Maria the maid. -That's why we pay you. -Fluffy! Fluffy! Wait! Maria! Don't you need this? What do you want? A blow job? -I'm sorry. -How can you say that? You make me stupid. Hi. -Did you have a nice day at work? -Yes. -Is he still living there? -I think so. -Do you talk to him? -A bit, of course. What do you talk about? Housework, mostly. -Housework? -You know... "Move your legs, sir. Can't you see I'm vacuuming?" Things like that. So he's still not a gentleman? -Who's this? -But kind of attractive? Huh? Wow. What a landscape! Going past the target. Getting close to it. -Huh? -Why do you want to know? I thought you wanted to forget about him? -Hope it stays hot. -Right. -Where's your brother? -He's waiting outside. Weve been shopping all day. -Hi? -Hi? Hope you enjoy the food. Hi? Hi? Hi. Sorry. I overslept. Busy days? Mom has hired a very particular maid. She's cheeky. Aren't you going to ask how I'm doing? How are you doing? Fine. We went to... ultrasound scan yesterday. And... I'm going to be a daddy. It's a girl. It felt so strange, Watching that tiny heart beating. I was like... I even asked Camilla if- -she wanted to marry me. Hide! It's him. It's your brother, Axel! I'm coming! Hi. -What? -Can I come in? -Are you with someone? -No, I... Hi. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. There was a girl from work here, but... She's shy. You know, mental problems. -Sure. -We're going to yoga. -That's why I'm dressed like this. -I don't care. If you don't care, What are you doing here? I wanted to make sure you were taking the pill. You wanted to know if I'm taking the pill? I don't want you to become pregnant. How would I even know I'm the father? I'm not with any other man. I love you. So, it's a- - "move your legs, can't you see I'm vacuuming"-relationship? -It's developed a bit. -How could you? I'm sorry. And you agreed, even though you weren't planning to do it? Hey, I've got a customer. Ive got to go. I'll call you later. Bye. -You want this? -Is it okay? Shouldn't you know What you're selling? Well, maybe. But I'm just a temp from Manpower, - -so you can't expect too much from me. -Well, it's not for me. -You want me to gift-wrap it? Hello? Hi. Talk to me. Get out. Hello? -Hi. -Jeez, are you still in bed? I can't find my wallet. You haven't seen it? Aren't you going to take your shoes off? -Take my shoes off? -She's just washed it. The maid. Maria. -Hi. -Hello. Maria? Have you seen my wallet? I can't find it. No, but I haven't looked for it. Do you want me to? No thanks, that won't be necessary. Thank you so much. I'll do it myself. She's really cute. Exceptionally beautiful, in a slightly cheeky way. -What do you do at home all day? -I'm working. On the Mac. Hydro-Statoil. I hope she doesn't think I suspect her of stealing? -Why should she? -I'm not that keen on having a maid. It's not me, in a way. There. Why not end a hand at home? You've got time enough. -But I do. -Here. Take this. -Bye. -Goodbye. Maria? I found it. Well, if you need some lunch, you know where to find everything, right? Very good. Excuse me? You lost this. -No, I don't think it's mine. -What about this? No, it's not mine. -What will you say when you meet her? -I don't know. Remember to tell her I'm not a pusher. That I'm really against drugs. That I'm just your little brother. Sure. We can use these. -Is she on your Facebook? -Yes. "Celebrated war reporter buys drugs from underage male prostitute." -How do you like it? -Sounds good. Hi. Are you still here? How long are you going to be mad at me? I can't stop this relationship. It's so passionate. We're so attracted to each other. When he looks at me, he loves me. -Why are you so disgusted? -I don't see how we can be friends. Do you want a cigarette? He bought you a present? Yeah. Well, open it. No... No. Axel! Axel. You're having a nightmare. I'm here. Mommy's here. I'll stay here until you fall asleep. Hello? My, this place is a mess! Hi. You could help clear up after yourself. Hey, hasn't Maria been here today? Oh dear. My darling. Have you been in a fight? -No, I got something in my eye. -Oh? What? But has she taken Fluffy for a walk? So why did he buy you that... Stupid present? You tell me. He's your brother. -Don't tell me you told him? -No, I didn't. Hi. We saw the lights were on. -Got any food? Or are you closed? -No. -I think hes a good man. -I'm sure. I'm talking about Mr. "I hurt so much". Him in the restaurant. -See you tomorrow. -Good luck. -Maria said you needed a hand. -Okay. -Could you take this? -Sure. -Where shall I put them? -You can put them here. Here? I'd better get Karsten to bed. What are you doing? I don't know. You make me feel bad. Maria, I hate you. But I think about you all the time. -I have to tell you something. -You're married? It's not about me, it's about you. -Found something bad under my bed? -It's not a joke. Do you remember the picture in your house you used to identify yourself? The one from the airport? Hi. Is Andrej asleep? Could you whisper in his ear- - that his mommy loves him? Bye. Hi. Maria's found another job. And my shoulder hurts too much. I can't vacuum. No, it's part of everyday life for many public figures. I don't buy drugs or use drugs. That pictures are posted... Ive got an appointment with Susanne Holmboe. You're really childish, you know. -Hi! -Hi. What a nice surprise. Have you changed? Oh my god. This is wonderful. Oh, wonderful! -Mom? -Yes, Axel? Why haven't you told me I have a sister? -Why haven't you? -Because we thought... We were your new family now. There wasnt room for a sister? -You didn't have the same father. -Okay. I see. Just the same mother. That's not important. But she'd already been adopted to someone else. And we didn't get along, her parents and us. You were attached to her. Cried for her. Had nightmares. She was older than you. Took care of you. She was like a mother to you. Just keeping in touch from time to time, seemed ruthless. It had to be everything or nothing. Am I too hard? No. No, it's fine. Why didn't you chuck this? The worthless little girl? Ive said you can work on it together. I landed the Statoil contract. And you know what? It's really been great here Without you around. So you can take a look. Axel? She's waiting for you. Try to be a gentleman. Please, have a seat. Nice flat. I inherited it from my Norwegian father. -He died three years ago. -Okay. He was a merchant captain. It was he who first heard about the two of us. Really? He got in touch with the orphanage we were in. Haven't they told you anything? Remember this? No. You didn't want to carry it, but it's yours. It's mommy. -Remember her? -No. Remember when we hid in the closet together? Why did I never hear from you, if you remember everything so well? I don't know. Cunt! Fucking cunt! Hi. How did it go? You think I should see someone? You mean like a doctor? Maybe it's too big for me to handle. Maybe I'll become a soft madman. See someone, then. I don't need a soft man. Mad is okay. Hi! Hi there! -Well, spot any elk? -No... Itll be okay. It could've been a twig swaying. It was an elk, okay? Yeah. -Couldve been a female with a calf. -But it wasn't! Why are you so upset? Too much for you to handle? -What do you mean? -You thought you were man enough. -Right. -And? Sorry to let you down, but shooting elk is the whole point of the hunt. The reason I hit it is because I can see. -I immediately saw it was an elk. -It's still true. You fired too soon. You didn't even see what you were shooting at! What are you trying to say? What? Spit it out. What if you'd hit someone? Hi. Hi. -I brought you some elk meat. -You shot an elk? I'll just take the meat inside. Are you coming back out afterwards? Yes. Would you lock the door? Mom made it. It's probably too sweet. Mom always stuffs my bag when I'm home. I think she's afraid I'm not eating properly. Do you have a bedroom? It's hard to think about my birth mother. It makes me want to cry. Is she dead? She had a bad life. He was a king, was October. I was a princess. They lived among roses, knew not the storm of the perfectly simple. They lived among roses, knew not the storm of the perfectly simple. -Where are you going? -I can't be with anyone now. What are you talking about? Remember the flyer from the restaurant? The soldier... On the photo, aiming at the two kids. It's me. It's me in the photo. Hear that? You know nothing about guilt. About feeling guilt. He feels sorry for himself. I didn't mean to yell at you. I just had a terrible nightmare. The children in the picture, the ones you aimed at. Don't you think they have nightmares too? You knew about your brother all along? -But never did anything about it? -No. Do you know why? Mom died... ...While we were hiding in the closet. I was the one who called the police. My brother didn't understand What had happened. Hi. It's mommy. Did you get the slippers? I'll be home soon to check that your toes are warm. Very soon. I'm afraid you have to use the cloakroom. Thank you. -Are you excited? -Yes. Is that why you're beaming? I'm in love. -That's nice. -Yeah. What do you think they want when they arrive? -Tea? -Right. It's a bit early for champagne. Hi. Axel. Hi. May I take your coats? She's Waiting inside. I'll join you in a moment. Hi. You can sit there if you like. -Hi. -Hi. -Anne. -Fredrik. -Would you like to sit here? -Thank you. -Anyone for tea? -Yes please. Did you bring the photo? She resembles you. Can I have a look? May I see? Poor thing. She was just a little girl. What do you want, Axe? I just want to sit here a while. With my sister. And her mother. And my father. And my mother. Dan4Jem
