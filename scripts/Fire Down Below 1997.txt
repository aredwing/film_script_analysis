Means a lot to me. Frank Elkins was found dead today. What? His truck went into the Nolin River. Broke his neck and back. According to the police, there was alcohol in the truck. They say it's an accident. I don't think so. Three dead agents. Two FBI a couple of nights ago, and now Frank. This thing started with an anonymous letter... ...from a coal town in Kentucky... ... talking about fish acting weird, kids getting sick. So Frank went in. He sent back soil and water samples... ... that were off the charts from this town, Jackson. Frank found out the Hanner Coal Company was dumping... ... thousands of barrels of deadly toxic waste in abandoned coal mines. Something's going on down there, and somebody's hiding it. Jesus Christ, Jack! You and your goddamn conspiracy theories. We're dealing with hillbillies that know their country better than we do. I want you to go in, find the dump... ... find the people who're putting it there and bring me back a witness. If we don't have a witness who'll testify, we got nothing. When was the last time I gave you "nothing"? Your contact in Kentucky is a preacher named Bob Goodall. Let's do this thing right for Frank. How do you do, sir? Bob Goodall. - Nice to meet you. - Glad to meet you. Welcome to Kentucky. - You're the preacher. - That's right. How come you ain't wearing a preacher collar? I'm a country preacher. - You all dress like that? - Yes, sir. Very nice. You play a little guitar? Every now and then. This is it. Here's your bathroom here. Radio picked up two stations, but one's out of business. Here's as good a list of folks to start with as any. Like I say, they don't talk much. People keep to themselves. Your best bet is to start easy. Fix a few porches. Get to know them a little bit. - Take a little time. - That's right. I don't know how much time I'll have, but I'll do the best I can. Mister, Mom said you might be thirsty. Your mama's right. What's your name? Christine. That's a pretty name. How about you? Alberta. That's pretty. And you? Her name's Rose, but she don't talk yet. She don't? She kind of shy? Yeah. Have you came to fix the roof on top of me? - Yes, I have. - Why? Because I think it needs fixing. Thanks. You're welcome. You here just with your mama? And Papa, but he's not home. He works in the mines. And Walter, our brother, he's sick. Walter's sick? What kind of sick? I don't know, just sick. Maybe I should say hello to him and cheer him up. Sure, come on in. Hi, Walter. How you doing? You drawing a picture? What's this one here? Is this a helicopter... ...or a UFO? He's shy. It's not a helicopter. This is a UFO. That's what I thought. See a lot of them around here? He's sick. No, I'm not. How long has the boy been sick like this? What kind of sickness you have? It's a kind of a rash. Does that itch or bleed or anything? You get dizzy and feel like you want to throw up? Reverend said you work on the outside. Yes, sir. The boy was sick. I came in to cheer him up. You're a good artist, I'm telling you. That's good. A little more. That's it. Hover right there. Hold her there. Let her down. My daddy wants to know who the hell he is. Maybe it's time I had a talk with him. Have the boys scare him a little first. Good morning. I think we got everything you ordered. That'll be $75. It's not free? No. No free goods. Here's your change, and you come back and see us. I'm going to do that. Two beautiful twins like you. - Gets a man thinking. - Bye-bye. How's the fishing around these parts? I like a perch dinner with fried potatoes. You catch perch about now? - No, I'm sweeping steps right now. - He's working. You better leave him alone. Ask old Cotton too many questions, he can't concentrate. Be worth nothing the rest of the day. Mrs. Hamill don't like that. I'm sorry. That won't happen again. I'm just here doing God's work. Got any questions, you can ask me. Good enough. What are you doing? - We got company. - I got him. What the fuck are you doing here? I was taking a little Sunday stroll. I guess maybe... ...it's not Sunday. A fine time to take a walk in our marijuana field! It's tough, huh? This is tough. We're deep in country here. Is it kind of like Deliverance? Deliverance. I guess I should be kind of scared. "You got a pretty mouth, boy." I got no business with you. Watch them, boy. Don't let them do nothing wrong. My jaw! Son of a bitch broke my jaw. Amen! That was wonderful singing, everybody. I believe we're getting better all the time. Before we get to the brunch part of our services today... ...we have a special visitor to the community, Mr. Jack Taggert. He's donated his time to help us... ...with any kind of carpenter problems that any of you may have. I know everybody's got a piece of wood busted somewhere. Henry, he already helped put a roof on at your place. During lunch, stop by and say hello to Jack Taggert. Make him feel welcome. Deacon, would you lead us in a benediction? May the Lord bless us and keep us... ...and His face shine upon us. Amen. Here. It's for you. That's a UFO right there. No question about it. At night... ...I see the lights on that hill sometimes. That's probably the headquarters for the UFOs. Nice of you to come and help us poor folks out. It's nothing that condescending. One question. Are you gonna screw up? You never know. There's a lot of misfits and losers doing your kind of work. Alcoholics, ex-cons trying to get to heaven. I probably fit right in there, don't I? If you do screw up, I'll be all over you. I'll do the best I can to keep that in mind, sir. You take care, Mr. Taggert. Jack Taggert. Hello. Sarah. That's a nice name. I was just sitting over there eating all by my lonesome. I thought you might like to come sit down and have some with me. You really are new here. Stand out a little bit, do I? I didn't mean that. Just... You're talking to me. Something wrong with talking to you? Excuse me. Sarah's a nice girl. Sad, though. Town don't really take to her. Why's that? A lot of history. People here don't give up history. Hey, Mr. Cotton! Where are you headed? In the direction I'm walking. Would you like a lift? I don't like to ride in cars. Might get to like it, then I'd want one. How about if I did some fixing on your house? It won't cost you nothing. Sure, but the worst thing you'd do would be to fix it up. I might like it. Isn't that good? No, I want to move. Why? House falling apart. That's like a Zen riddle. - I'll see you around. - All right then. Is this the Kellogg residence? Yes, it is. But I think you know that, Mr. Taggert. I was noticing that the steps were all kind of broken down. I could get under there and fix it all up. I don't hand out Bibles, and it won't cost nothing. Thank you, but I'm not interested. Thank you. You're welcome. Shit! Morning, boys. The snakes didn't do it. - He's starting to piss me off. - He's just making fun of us. What the hell? Snakes! - Thought you weren't afraid of snakes. - Look who's talking. Did you see that? The whole town saw it, you idiot. Know how that affects my dad and me? I ought to put a bullet in your head. I know guys like this. You push, they push back. You don't push, they won't either. Let it go. I'm in charge, Lloyd. You don't like it, resign. What we got coming in here every night, I don't need this. I want him gone. Son, all I'm saying is maybe you ought to call your daddy first. Before you do anything else. I won't tell you. Come on, Natalie, you're killing me. I have to know. I'm in a meeting. It's your son, sir. I'm out of the country. - Hey, Daddy. - What's up? We got another situation down here. New visitor. You call the fire department when someone lights a cigarette? They only send one idiot at a time. It'll take months before some new guy can do squat. So keep it business as usual and keep him away from it. Jesus, boy! The Marines haven't landed. I got things to do. See, I know exactly what my daddy wants. Business as usual. So I don't want to see him on my street or in my church. - Come over here! - Mama! Hi. Hi, how are you doing? You know better than that. Hello. - How are you doing? - I'm good. Look, I only sold six jars... ...of your honey this week. Want to put that against your groceries? Yes, please. Thank you. Bye, now. You take care. How do you do? Can I help you? I was thinking I might like to have all these items here. I also think I might like to have all that honey. Yes, sir. All of it. Let me ask you something. What are you going to do with all this honey? It's about five miles to home. It's not a bad walk if the day is nice. What's this... ...smoke in the mountains? That coal's been burning in that mountain for 12 years now. Does it ever concern anybody... ...that the earth's on fire underground? No matter how strange something is... ...if you give it enough time, it becomes normal. No more questions. Come on in. Thanks for the lift. I've been thinking about my porch. Would you still consider fixing it? What made you change your mind? It broke this morning. I'll be there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Have a nice day, ma'am. You too. There's a singing contest at the street fair Saturday. Patsy and I are gonna sing. Come out and vote for us. What do I get? My sister. - All right! - Okay. Deal. We heard you're helping Sarah. That's nice of you, after what she did to her dad. We shouldn't talk about that. She's just another one of God's children. - How you doing, sir? - Morning. You should hear these small-town girls, the way they gossip. They sing good too. How about that porch? Lord, I just got over the flu. Let me think about it. About what? Think about how you guys wrecked your truck. Think about that. Oh, Lord! A lot of folks don't appreciate a fellow like you coming here... ...sticking his nose where it don't belong. You need to be careful, slinking around here. Somebody may think you're an animal and shoot. You understand what he's saying? - Somebody gonna get hurt. - You mean someone might get hurt? You could be an English teacher except you don't understand plain English. Get out. "Get out." That's pretty plain English. Believe it or not, people here like me. They'd like me to stick around. I've decided to stick around a while. I've also decided... ...that if you don't like it, that's tough shit. I got your tough shit right here. My nose! Sometimes two isn't enough. Want to call a few more folks? I cracked my wood. That's no good. I'm damaging my lumber. I'll just use my hands. My nose! I should've known you'd be a world-class screw-up... ...public brawl like this. You're under arrest for assault and battery and disturbing the peace. It was self-defense. I saw them. They jumped him. Anybody else see anything? Nothing. No problem here. Appreciate your help, Reverend. Listen to me. Investigators been hounding Hanner Coal Company for years. Nobody's found anything. I'm afraid they'll hurt you. Is that why you send me to folks who ain't gonna talk about him? Folks here don't like to talk, you know. I also know that this man supports your church... ...which wouldn't be here if not for his support. You're a good man. One of these days you'll say... ..."The money ain't worth what it'll do to my people." I think you'll come around to that. I believe you will. We still got us a situation. You even hurt him? I'm gonna blow his brains out. - Might need a grenade launcher. - Dad said don't kill him. Shit! Now I gotta tell him what happened. They used to kill the messenger that brought the bad news. Give me something to drink. I bet you could use some tea. Yes, ma'am. You're a mind reader. Honey? Yes, please. You ever get lonely up here, just with the bees and all? Well, you know... ...I helped my daddy gather honey until I was 16. And then when he died in the mines, I just kept on. So I feel like a part of him has kept on too. No, I don't get lonely. Was he a miner before he was an engineer? When he was an engineer, did he make maps and stuff like that? You ask a lot of questions. I'm sorry. Why don't you ask me some questions? All right. Why do you do this work? I do this work because the money's so good. And I have no family. And I do it... ...because it makes me feel good, and it's nice to help people. That's nice. Looks like some weather coming. I better get back to work. I'm out of nails. I can get those for you. On the front seat of the car. Coming up. Top seat. Find them? Yeah. I hear you've been asking a lot of questions around town. Where I come from, that's how people get to know one another. They ask questions and talk. Good thing to do. Try it sometime. Maybe someday I will. I've decided I like the idea of somebody helping me... ...but not for free. Will you come for supper tonight? I guess so. Seven? That'd be great. Good evening. These mountains are the most beautiful on earth. Most church charity types talk about God... ...how they walk with God, how they found God... They talk at you instead of to you. And they never ask your opinion. And that's all you do. You're a cop, right? Not exactly. I work for the federal government. I was told that somebody's dumping some dangerous toxic waste down here. I wanted to see if I could come down and stop it. I want to stop it too. Do you still want to fix my porch? Yes, sir, I'll do that. You ever seen anybody doing any dumping up here? I've seen weird lights over there at night. Helicopters, stuff like that. My steps need fixing too. I can do that. That Carter boy was talking to me about seeing some lights up there. I think it's helicopters dumping something up there. You know how to get up there? No, but I can show you something. Watch out for these rocks. They're slick. There you go. Dead fish everywhere. It happens after a big rain. Young'uns are dying. It's been like this for months, and it's got worse lately. I didn't think you knew about fish. My uncle told me never to tip your hand too early in a card game. You're guaranteed to lose. That's good advice. You sent me that letter? Yes, sir, I sent it. Now that you know who I am and I know who you are... ...I'm heading into town. Want a ride? Of course. Make it some charity event. Celebrities love that shit. They draw the people... ...like flies. For chrissake, now what? What do you think? Tell me what's going on in one small town in the middle of nowhere... ...and why you can't handle it. I am handling it. Shit, boy. Cover up and get out of here. I've got a meeting. Sure, honey. He's a fed. EPA. Name's Jack Taggert. I had to call in a favor... ...to find out what's going on in my own town because my son couldn't handle it. Want me to take him out? You couldn't take out a cheeseburger from a drive-through window. He wants a fight, don't give him one. Use Lloyd. Tell him to get something on him, and get some witnesses this time. I can do that with one call. You're two days away from a new porch. - How much do I owe you for the ride? - I'd say 50 bucks. - You just funning me. - Yes, sir, I am. Sure got to thank you. By the way... ...I forgot my driveway's going to need paving too. Really? That's a joke. I ain't got no driveway. That's a good joke. - I'll see you later. - I'll see you around. You know what's funny? We thought we'd just stop by. Here you are romancing somebody else. He drops you off just like you've been out on your first date. Personally, he's not my type. Tell me something. He get to first base, or did you take him all the way to home plate? Good evening, Mr. Taggert. How are you, ma'am? I'm very well, thank you. Hungry? This looks awfully nice. Thank you. I'll get the food. You're a good cook. I'm not, but thank you. What makes you hang around a town... ...where folks don't seem to quite understand you? Well, I did leave once. I just decided in the middle of the night, out of the blue... ...that I had to live in Louisville. The first day I had an apartment, I was robbed. They got all the money I'd saved, jewelry, everything. But, you know, I'm not much of a city gal. Anyway, this is home. Yeah, I can understand that. I had heard that there's a street dance. You might like to come with me. You mean... ...together on a date? Yes, I'd love to. I'd love to. Look at this! Hey, Sare. How you doing, little sister? I'm a whole two days early. You are. Jack Taggert, this is my brother, Earl. How are you, Jack? Any friend of my little sister is a friend of mine. Damn, it is good to be home! I'll tell you, my little sister is the best cook in eastern Kentucky. I know the best hunting in this state. I know these mountains. Maybe we'll do some hunting. That'd be great. Hey, little sister. - Anyone like dessert? - It's getting late. Thank you so much for the dinner. That was great. My pleasure. Come back soon, all right? He's a nice guy. So how well do you know him? How well you ever know anyone? I'm glad for you to meet somebody. It's just that... I don't know. I don't get a good feeling about this guy. You get a bad feeling about anyone who looks at me. Let me put it this way. I don't want this guy around here fixing anything. Oh, really? It's kind of funny. I'm gone for a few weeks... ...and little Miss Caterpillar turns into a social butterfly. It's a hard world out there. It's dangerous. You don't have much experience. Maybe I can take care of myself. I'm just trying to talk to you. Don't get unhinged on me. I'd hate to call those doctors to talk to you again. I just don't want you rushing into anything. It'd kill me if anybody hurt you. That's all. What'd they do to you? Let me see if I can get you out of here. Get the door, please? Take him all the way in to exam room one. Another few hours, he wouldn't have made it. He got a concussion. Another fine day in paradise. I'll be back, buddy. You all know what's going on here. Good morning. How are you? Would you come with me, please? You wanna go have some coffee? I'm not here to socialize. I saw you beat up five men. Cotton is beat almost to death. People get hurt, you're always around. Assault and battery. That's good for a 10-day lockup. Listen, why don't we cut the shit? You know who I am. I can arrest you as easy as you can arrest me. And you know it. So why don't you get back in Orin's car with Orin's little department... ...and take off? I don't believe in your authority. You'll believe a gun. Cuff him. Now, how you want to do this? Wanna play this game all the way? I'll have 300 agents come up here into this hick town... ...and crawl up every orifice you got. Then you can go to your proctologist and get... ...an ointment to rub on the hole that hurts most. How do you want it? How do you want it? Let's go. Who are you, Mr. Taggert? I'm a federal agent for the EPA. We received several reports... ...that someone has been dumping extremely large quantities... ...of toxic waste in these hills. It concerns me because if it gets into the aquifer... ...it could destroy drinking water for thousands of miles... ...and kill a bunch of people here. Why did you feel like you had to lie to me? Did you really want to come and fix my porch and get to know me? Or was that a lie too? Where I come from we call it betrayal, and it is no way to make friends. I loved fixing your porch, and I'm very interested in you. You know what I love about this show? Who cares if they move the same way or not? Still makes you feel great. Sir, it's your son. This better be good news. He said if we arrest him, he'd have federal agents all over this town. I got 50,000 barrels of cyanide rolling down there right now. Where do you want me to put it? You mean where you want me to put it? What the hell are you, a goddamn parrot? I made 16 million on this deal. You think I'm giving it back? I own this state, so what the hell is the problem? Doesn't he know the rules? I'm the rules. It's me. I got another job for you. That guy Taggert, in Jackson. My children... ...are all I got. I didn't know you were trying to help my boy when you came. I thank you for that. I'm sorry about before. I know you had your reasons. I have mine. These are my daddy's maps. I want to help. Do you mind if I say a few words? Thank you. Please be seated. You know, the trouble with rich people... ...is that sometimes they don't care about others. These folks that are making the profits by dumping... ...toxic waste, petroleum byproducts and stuff like that... ...are making the profit. Why don't they dump that in their own backyard? But instead... ...they pay some poor shit... forgive me, Father... - Five dollars an hour to truck this up into the mountains of Appalachia. Why? Because they think... ...you all are ignorant... ...barefoot... ...poor, dumb hillbillies... ...that don't have the money and the power to fight back. To these people, you all are insignificant. You mean nothing. And if anyone out there thinks... ...the $300 they gave you for a new satellite or to look the other way... ...is worth selling out your legacy... ...and the future of your children... ...please raise your hand. I don't see no hands. Think about this. You know why I'm here. Let's all come together as one family and fight this. Can I have a word with you? I know what's going on with these barrels. That's the problem. All these problems seem so big, it's hard to find your way around them. I wanted to keep the church. I thought I could make a difference. I realize church can't help nobody after they're all dead. So I'm gonna make a change. Right in here. And by God, I swear, if you'll drag their sorry ass to court... ...I'll testify against every one of them. We might make a good team. Let's go, boys. There's your allowance. I need to talk to you for a moment. We didn't get Taggert. Guy's a goddamn pit bull. I have to divert our next shipment. Shut down. We can't risk it. You're giving me a headache. Don't divert anything. It's time I see this guy. Yes, sir, Daddy. Jack! Are you ready? We are too. Now come on! Where are those at? Free round trip to the new Hanner Casino. My hometown and I ain't forgetting it. You play guitar? - Is it all right if he plays? - Sure. There he goes. Get up on a microphone there. Hey, little lady! We should know each other better. - Since you're coming into town so much... - Let go of me. - Let's dance. - I don't want to. Don't you want to dance with me? I wanna get to know you. Normally, when a man insults a woman, he insults the man she's with. In this case... ...it's not worth it. Government-agent man come to take out our community trash. Now that's worth it. That hurts. Really? Turn him loose. I said turn him loose. I want you to apologize to the lady. Quick, before you fall asleep. I apologize, Miss Sarah. You came this close to having me stomp your ass. Mr. Hanner wants to see you. That would be fine. Where is he? Give me just a second, babe. How you doing tonight? What's going on? Take care. How's the proctologist? Everybody, come on. Gather back around. What do you say? How about a love song? How did you do that thumb thing? That was good. I liked that. It's just a card trick. I'll show you someday. I'll come straight to the point. What's your price? Excuse me? I have a lot of money. I'll give you some to go away. Everyone has his price. What's yours? Let me think about that a minute. How about... ...the life of my friend? Or how about if you took the poison out of the air, out of the earth... ...out of the water that you've left up here. If you could do any of those, not only would I leave... ...but I'd be impressed. Think about my offer. I already have. You can't prove anything. You won't find anything. Life is short. It is very short. Do you want to spend another minute of yours here? I feel alive up here. I was thinking I might even buy a house up here, move in. Kiss my ass. This guy is trouble. - That's what... - Shut up. I want the mine sealed... ...and I want Taggert buried inside it. You know who to call. Give this to him. How will I ever take over if you don't let me run my operations? You won't have to. I'm gonna live forever. Your beau is quite a fellow. He's trying to help us, Earl. How's that? We sure could use your help. What do you mean? You know which mines are used to store the chemicals. Come on, help us out. You can be a hero. - I ain't no hero. - But you can be. You can do the right thing. I don't know. We'll see. I do love a good waltz, don't you? There's a fire up there! That's the church. I know the bastards who are behind this. I got to tell you, I've taken money from these bastards. I've even helped them dump their shit into the ground. But this... Is Mr. Goodall in there? - I don't know where he is. - You better hope he's alive. I'll take you to the dumpsite. You know Clearwater Road? - Yes, sir. - I'll meet you there... ...in a half-hour. - Isn't it better to go together? No, sir. I don't want to be seen leaving with you. They're putting a load in there tonight. It's a dangerous place. I'm proud of you, Earl. Do you think I'm a damn fool idiot? This guy's gonna sink us all. He don't give a shit about country folk. He'll put me in jail. He's not like that. Did you sleep with him? What? You whore. When he's gone, things are going back to the way they were. What are you talking about? Before Daddy died. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. You'll just get robbed again... ...have to call your big brother to come get you. Believe me, you will get robbed again. Starting this stupid honeybee business gave you some big ideas. Think you're ready to take on the world. You talk to any guy who looks at you. Them bastards just want one thing... ...and they can't have it. It's too bad about the reverend. He always did talk too much. You need help, Earl. I'm going to the police. I'm going to tell them everything. I'm going to tell them about you and about Daddy. I'm going to tell them about all of it! I knew that guy was going to be a bad influence on you. Touch me, I swear I'll kill you! You better not miss, or I'm liable to get upset! I hate you! I'm not going to jail. I'll do anything. Even if that means being an only child. Where the hell you going? Your friend's gonna have an accident. He's gonna die under the mountain. What are you talking about? Let me out of here! Quarter mile in. Somebody once asked my pa how far down hell was... ...and he said, "Just a quarter mile." I'll bet that's about right. What's the gun for? Just in case. Get in. This here is the mother lode. A lot of toxic waste down here. I see it leaking all over the place. It looks radioactive. I bet you this shit glows in the dark. You don't want to drink it. How'd you cut your hand? Guess I cut myself on the gate. I noticed that Sarah gets awful nervous around you. What do you have to say about that? She's nervous around most men. I guess you heard what happened. She just never did get over that. That right? I think she never got over it because she didn't do it. My theory is... ...when she was a little girl, you were molesting her. Your daddy found out, went to throw you a bad beating one time... ...and you killed him. Then you said, "Little sister, this gun went off by accident. I'm an adult. If they convict me and I go to prison, you'll be all alone. If you take the rap for me, you're a minor. They won't do nothing to you." So you convinced her to do that. And everybody in town... ...is convinced that she's crazy and she killed her daddy... ...when really you did it, didn't you? Ain't you slicker than possum shit? You got a sharp mind and a fast mouth. Hey, Jimmy Joe. Bobby T. This is Mr. Taggert. He's a government man with some agency. I don't know, what is that... ...the EPA? FDA? FBI? I'm not sure. Come down here to show us backwoods folk how to do things. These are my buddies. They work down here. I wanted you to meet them... ...because I'm not sure you appreciate... ...what it means to be poor. To have to put bread on the table. I imagine your coat cost more than Cyrus' wages for a month. Damn thing is, Jack, I like you. And my sister likes you too. That's why I'm not gonna kill you. Randall, you do it. Kill that son of a bitch! Give me that. Can you hear this, Daddy? You okay? Earl's going to kill you. You all right? Earl was killed in the explosion in the mine. We got to worry about Hanner. If you testify, we can put them in jail. That means it's gonna get hot around here. I'll see if I can put you in protective custody. In the meantime, we'd better pack and get out of here. - Chick Larsen. - It's me. Listen. We found the stuff. How big is it? It's the most I've seen in one spot. There was a cave-in... ...so it's unstable. We have to move fast. Also... ... I have a witness who needs protective custody. How can I help? Send a couple of agents from the Witness Protection Program. See if we can escort her out of here to a safe place. Meet me on Highway 98. The cavalry's on its way. Just hang in there. I'll make the call. There they are. Officer Adams. We've been briefed by Agent Larsen. Is this the wit? This is her. How will you find me? He can get in touch with us anytime through Agent Larsen. These gentlemen will take good care of you. You go with them now. Will you know where I am? He'll know every step of the way. I have a direct line through Chick. Is that a quick-draw rig? Yes, it is. Odd for a federal agent, isn't it? We're in the country here, and they let us do what we want. We'll be in touch. Go! Stop the car! Stop the car! Shut up, lady! Come on! Get the fuck out, now! Get away from that window, boy! Everybody down! Sit down! Shut up and act like nothing's happening! Stay down! Come on. Let me get his attention. Tell your boss I'm coming to get him. On second thought, I'll tell him. Holy shit! Stick around. We're gonna have some fun. You're a five-alarm fuckup. What am I paying you for? - Want me to find someone else? - No. Taggert doesn't know about me. I can protect you. I'll make sure any investigation goes nowhere. Then you oversee the cleanup of the cave-in. Any problems, you're out. No problem. I'm going to head into town and take care of a few things. Then I'll come back and finish fixing this porch. Don't worry about a thing. You'll be safe here. You're never gonna come back, are you? Your fling with the country girl is over. You can tell me the truth. I'm an adult. No. I was going to go take care of Hanner... ...come back here... ...and get you. You can count on it. Please approach the bench. Mr. Hanner, you are accused of dumping... ...4. 1 million barrels... ... of toxic waste, 42 times... ...in 13 different locations. How do you plead? Your Honor, he pleads guilty under the Emergency Planning... ...and Citizens' Right to Know Act. - Very well. That's a $25,000 fine. I'm fining you an additional 25,000 for failing to disclose... ... your company's toxic release inventory. Next case. That's what I love about this country. I made 300 million last year, and it only cost me 50 grand. Can I have a word with you? The EPA's never been good at punishing criminals, catching them... ...helping the environment. I got a surprise for you. I quit the EPA. So I can spend my every waking moment making your life miserable. We played this one by your rules. Your court decided I was clean. You're violating my constitutional rights. Mr. Hanner, I promise you as sure as you stand here now... ...I'm going to show you a new meaning to the word "violation." How you doing, Chick? Didn't expect to see you here. I know why you didn't expect to see me here. You set up Frank, didn't you? What are you saying? If it weren't for you, they'd have never found him. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. - Anything you say will be... - You can't arrest me! I outrank you. Who do you think you are? I was going to ask you that. You're a piece of shit. I'm ashamed of you. Hook him up. Come and hold this bag. Why? It ain't going nowhere. Just heel, damn it. Lean into it more, like this. Here, boy. I want to talk to you. What you afraid of? It's just Mr. Agent Man. Want to arrest me for 10 minutes too? Come here, boy. Let's talk. You come here. Don't hide behind that big old pimple. - You don't have shit on me. - I have quite a bit on you. But our current judicial system wouldn't provide adequate punishment for you. You really deserve to suffer. And since I'm feeling selfish... ...I've arranged for that to happen. Leave my friend alone or I'll have to educate you on how to beat the shit... ...out of somebody. In fact, you must be a dumb motherfucker... ...or you wouldn't be here. He'll whip your ass like a rented mule. He's going to slap you like a redheaded stepchild. I've been all over Appalachia and met lots of fine people. I've never met any people like you. You guys are unique. You've hung out with the ignorant people. We're educated. Education can't buy common sense. If your dad knew how stupid you were, he'd trade you in for a pet monkey. Go! Go! Get him. Now! My nose! My nose! You got to have more than that, son. Here, boy. Let's talk. Now's the time for you to step up and be a man. You want to talk to me now? What do you want? You have to talk to me. You know the things your father's doing ain't good. You have to turn state's evidence. You can do that... ...because it's the only way to save your ass... ...or because it's the right thing. I don't really give a shit, but you're going to do it. Yes, sir. Is there some sort of problem, Mr. Taggert? There's a problem for Orin Hanner. I've got a warrant for his arrest. I don't care if it's tablets from God. This is a private party. I have a right to effect this arrest by whatever means necessary. You're obstructing justice. Use of force will only add millions to the lawsuits. Now you can sue me. Thank you very much, everybody! Next show will be in a few minutes. Some guys don't know when to quit. - Who? - Just some dumb cop. I got $1,000 says he's on the ground in 30 seconds. I'll take that bet. Can I help you? I have a warrant for Hanner's arrest. I'm sure he's right back there. I let you in, I lose my job. Better than losing your teeth. Hold on, hold on. John-boy is confused. What he means is, take that warrant... ...and shove it up your ass. Sir, you're obstructing justice... Open the door! Howdy, Orin. Hi, Jack. Have a seat. Can I get you a drink? I don't drink much. Call me. I haven't met you, but I'm sure you don't care about that. Good luck with this incredibly large fellow. We're in a... ...unique situation. I realize the EPA wasn't able to put you away. I was kidding when I told you I resigned. I'm still active. These men are with the FBI. They came to help me serve this warrant. Your son provided us with enough evidence... ...to stack up a lot of years. My son's a real disappointment to me. We've got you on extortion, conspiracy to commit murder... ...murder and racketeering. We're talking 30 years. That's ugly. That's a long time to go without a woman. I knew you were gonna say that. I have a dear friend named Tyrone that's promised me that... ...when you hit prison, he'll take you under his wing... ...and teach you the most intimate social graces of prison. You'll be in good hands, so don't worry about that. That takes care of the woman thing. But you're talking to a 60-year-old man. That means I'd probably die in prison... ...or wish to God I had. Unless you live to be a very old man. So I guess... ...that makes killing you free. It would be free if you could. That's fast. Hook him up. I got him. That's fast. You're under arrest. Hands behind your... Agent down! Get me an ambulance. I'm still alive, asshole. I know you're alive. That could be because I'm a bad shot. Or that I'm a good shot... ...and just wanted you to meet Tyrone. I'll let you think about that. Fuck you, Jack. See you around, buddy. Hi. GELULA & CO., INC.
