And by "slow" he means turn the other way and walk fast. So you haven't even talked to her? lt's like this. A girl like Desi is never gonna go out with me so l figure, why not hold on to the hope instead of suffer the disappointment? You should at least talk to her before you go back to school. At least then you could make a piece. Yeah, look who's talking potsy! Well, what the fuck does that mean? Oh, nothing. Yeah, nothing, just-- Look, Kevin Bacon and Elvis Presley. (Tobe) Let's do it.

[vicious Iaughter] [rooster] [joyous cIassicaI music] [eerie chord] [mangIed chords and wet meat] [shriII eerie music] [swoosh] Excuse me, Dr. Weems. Miles Munson's lab work is ready. Tell him l'll be right in. [whispering] Okay. (Miles) l never heard of a sperm bank turning anyone down before. You can imagine my nervousness when they suggested l see a urologist. lt isn't anything serious, is it? Life-threatening, no. As a matter of concern, yes. Have a look in there, Miles. (Miles) Wow! Look at them aII go. (doctor) That is an exampIe or normaI sperm. And that is your sperm. [ominous music] (Miles) Yikes. [suspenseful chord] That doesn't look good. Miles, there's a new medication l'd like to suggest you try. lt's called Spermupermine. Now, it can't increase the sperm you generate but what it can do, is strengthen the sperm you already produce. Spermupermine? Yes. lt hasn't been approved by the FDA yet, but it is available to test subjects. Luckily for you, l'm on the research board. [chuckIing] Thank you, doctor. [shouting] (man over TV) Good morning, kids! lt's the Captain Fatso Show. And l'm Captain Fatso! [shouting] Well, ahoy there, Captain Fatso, say, are those gumdrops l smell? (Fatso) Look kids, it's DudIey DingIeberry! [kids shouting] (Fatso) I'm starving! l haven't even had breakfast yet! (Fatso) Let me teII you about the new sponsor! [shouting] [suspenseful music] [TV show continues] [music stops] (Fatso over TV) Peanut Mush is now enhanced with new fIavored chemicaIs. Makes your breakfast even more scrump-diIIy-dumptious! Sounds de-lish. [shouting] Morning, Miles. Uh, morning, Larry. Hey, you still single, buddy? Unfortunately. My wife's college roommate just got divorced and moved to town. Perfect for you. You should take her to dinner tomorrow night. Absolutely not. No way, no more blind dates. Not after last time. Come on, she's perfect. You should just do this, okay? She's cute. She's not looking for anything serious. Just a little companionship. You know? [train horn] [playful music] [jazzzzy music] Oh. Allow me. [suspenseful chord] Oh. [grunting] Miles, are you okay? Come here. l just had a horrible shooting pain in my balls. You think you sat on your balls when you sat down? l don't know. Oh! You twisted the veins in your testicles. Classic vein twist. Okay. Okay. [panting] l'm good. l'm so-- (man) Okay, onto the consolidation of our acquisitions of GeneraI TextiIe Industries and MBT Plastics. For a brief overview, we'd like to introduce to you all the newest member of our department, Andie Sumner. [jazzzzy music] Hello, gentlemen. [jazzzzy music] Oh! [sighing] l'm such a klutzz. Oh. [grunting] Are you okay? Someone, help him up. No, l'm all right. l'm all right. l'm all right. Ugh. l just need a little bit of air. l'm sorry. Excuse me for one second. [grunting] l don't know if it has anything to do with the pills that you gave me, but every time l get the least bit aroused l get the most intense shooting pain [whispering] through my testicles. Tsk. Well, there's only one way to find out. [scream and suspenseful chord] What in God's name-- [suspenseful music] Miles? Are you all right? l think so. Give me the sample, Miles, so we can get it under the microscope right away. l don't think you're gonna need a microscope. Oh! [wet meat] [panting] My God. What's wrong with me? It's impossibIe, but it wouId appear that the Spermupermine has had an adverse effect on your system. It's not onIy strengthening your spermatozzoa but it's causing it to grow to gargantuan proportions. And traditionaIIy, when a man experiences arousaI, his testicles produce more sperm. But in your case, however, when you get turned on, the one sperm you do have gets huge. [wet meat] [suspenseful music] I'm gonna send this to the National Institute of HeaIth in Washington for analysis. Discontinue use of the medication immediately. lf you feel your sperm enIarging again you get it out of your system right away. Get it out of my system? Jerk off! Fast! [sighing] [cheerful Latino music] [knocking] [soft music] Hi. You must be Miles. [suspenseful chord] l'm Louise. [suspenseful music, intensifying] [grunting] [suspenseful chord] No. Oh, my God! What happened? Are you-- Are you okay? May l use your bathroom just for a minute, please? Of course. Come right in. Right down the hall. l'll just be one second and l'll be back. Oh. [grunting] [suspenseful music continues] [growIing] Molly, just what kind of a nut did you and Larry set me up with? Hon, Louise says that Miles showed up at her door, grabbed his crotch and started screaming. Wha-- He's-- He's in the bathroom now, he's making weird-- l can hear him. (Larry) Louise, Miles twisted a vein in one of his testicIes. Yeah, it hurts him sometimes. He feeIs bad about it. Don't make a fuss over it. He's a good guy. Okay. That is enough out of you. l'm so sorry. No, it's gonna be okay. He's just a brute. That guy is such an asshole. [gasping] l can hear him. The poor guy-- Now l just feel sorry for him. [intense suspenseful music] [shouting] [loud thud] [wet meat] [grunting] [suspenseful chord] [clink] She hung up. [ominous music] [thumping and wet meat] [thumps and crashing] [glass shattering] [knocking] Miles? [thumping] Are you all right in there? [grunting, crashing] [wet meat] Ugh! [flushing] [sighing] That was a close one. [ominous music] Oh, no! [Louise, knocking] Miles. I'm getting very concerned. lt sounds like something broke in there. You don't happen to have a plunger, do you? Oh. Just what in the hell happened in here? l'm on a new medication. [spIashing] Oh! [growling] Oh, my God! [ominous music] lt's getting bigger! [growling] Run! [Louise, screaming] No! Run! Ugh. [growling and squealing] [screaming] Oh! [screaming] [screaming] [screaming and sound of wet meat] [growling] [Louise, screaming] [crash] [growling] [glass shattering] [thump] [gurgling] Um. l can explain that. He's a nice guy, don't get me wrong, but-- "Nice" just don't count in the bedroom when you got a baby gherkin between your legs. Come on, Stewie. Make a poo poo for momma, Come on, be a good boy. l'm not exaggerating. The guy's hung like Howdy Doody, and that's being generous. [ominous music] [chuckling] Of course l'm gonna see him again. Did you see his car? lt's a Cadillac. No, that sizze was more than acceptable-- [eerie sound and dog whining] Stewie! Will you please shut up? l'm sorry. He flunked obedience school. The mongoloid. [ominous music] [wet meat] [whining] [monster growIing, dog whining] Why does it smell like Ajax? [Ioud growI] Stewie! Ow! You almost dislocated my-- Stewie? [ominous chord] l have to call you back, mom. Stewie just escaped from his leash again. There you are. [wet meat] You furry fugitive, you. You'd better get your little butt over here before-- [gasping] [growling] [wet meat sound] [squirting sound] [accordion music] [Ioud thump] [metaIIic cIanking] [ominous chord] [cIanking continues] [shouting] You almost gave me a heart attack. Me too! What'd you get? [chuckling] [humming] [chuckling] A Milk Dud. [laughing viciously] So, what did you find? Half a rotisserie chicken. [laughing] You're gonna split that with me, right? Yeah. Maybe. For a hand job. [suspenseful music] Don't be such a prude, Babs. lt's not like you ain't done it Sp-- Sperm! Exactly!

[woman shouting] [running footsteps] [growling] [shouting] [cIanking and shouting] [shouting, echoing] l want to thank you for being so understanding. You know, a lot of girls would've run for the hills if the sperm of their blind date shot up their skirt like that. So, thanks again. l swear to God, l will pay for any damages. Oh, please, things can be replaced. Testicles can't. Now that's for sure. l'm just glad you're-- Uh. Louise? What's the matter? [panting] Oh, my God. Miles. That's your sperm.

Whoa. lt's just like in the movies, huh? l-- l-- l got nothing. (Mr. K) The most viIe and offensive stock of ceIIuIoid. Here is Deathication. [Iaughing viciousIy] [spooky music] [door opening] Oh, hello. l didn't see you there. Come in, won't you? Would you mind, uh, closing the door, please? [cIosing door] Thank you very much. As l was saying, my name is Fernando Phagabeefy. lnternationally known and respected film maker. The visionary mastermind behind notorious cinematic works such as, The Cunting Death, Salo 2, The Next Day and of course, Rosemary's Picnic TabIe. l here now to present to you my latest and greatest moving picture. A film so scandalous, so intense, that it was banned from every film festival in fear of mass hysteria, and destroyed seating. The next 87 minutes you're about to endure a motion picture l've directed called, Deathication, comes with a very serious warning. This film was specifically produced to elicit the effect of pure terror on the audience to a complete and total sensory immersion to the images on screen using the latest in cinematic technology. The lights of which we can have revealed here in fear of government confiscation. The following visuals printed on this very film stock are proven to cause a highly visceral, biological response in the human nervous system in the most, hm, nefarious of ways. Oh, hello, doctor. As you can see from our scientific results, this photo realistic rendering of one, the human body, each and every frame of Deathication swiftly attacks the viewer's brainwaves, rendering specific motor functions helpless to the depravity that unfolds before your very eyes. At any moment during the course of this film, viewers have been know to suddenly and violently release their bowels! A collective explosion of hot, moist madness. ln other words, what you're about to see will make you shit. A lot! Buckets of excrement! A river of ca ca wiII rage through this theater's as one buttery floor. You'll crap your slacks for days to come, ruin many undergarments become severely dehydrated, brave scorn at any social event or family gathering, even suffer from a case of inflamed anal tissue similar, to the effects of sodomy. ln other other words, this film will rape you with your own feces. And that, my friends, is a Fernando Phagabeefy promise. With this warning in mind, by staying in this theatre, you're releasing any rights and liability against the film makers or the owner of this fine establishment for any cleaning bills, shattered senses, or exploded ovaries. So, for the safety of you, those around you and the integrity of your swimming trunks area, please consider this your final warning. Those in the audience who have a weak constitution or a giant asshole, should leave this theatre immediately! Unless you are truly prepared to experience the horrific effects of, Deathication. Because you can't scream if you're full of shit.

Miles' unique body chemistry clashed with the Plutoneide and the Spermupermine mutating his spermatozzoa during spermatogenesis in a way that no one could've expected. Spermatium are by their very nature a very determined and resilient organism genetically programmed to overcome all obstacles defy all odds and hit the target. or die trying. Perhaps-- You can view this disaster as a kind of cautionary tale against the misuse of a yet to be fully understood era in atomic energy. God help us all.
