Who are you? Would you like to come with me? You know me? I can do. Will you sing with me? Please! Are you Dmitri? Where's Anna? Where's Anna? Do you know what's going on here? What are they trying to do to me, huh? What the fuck is going on here? They said to deliver a package. I've got to bring it here, deliver a package to you. There's this girl, and now I'm singing. What the fuck am I singing for? Help me. What the fuck am I singing for? Deliver the package. Yes. Yeah. I can't open it. I don't know the code. Did they do this to you? Who's this? It is who you must kill. If you do not... They will kill her. This is what I am to say to you. I can't... I can't do that. I can't do that. If you do not, they will kill her. It is his life or hers. I can't kill someone. I can't. And neither could I. Fuck you. Fuck you! Anna says hello. She's counting on you, Matthew. What are you doing? Huh? - Matt? - Oi. Matt? - What? - Yeah, Matt. Going to the Fairview estate. Yeah, don't look so surprised, mate. You booked me. Well, get a wiggle on. While I'm still young. London's massive! London is... I've been to Paris. It's a big town. It's a big town. There's no doubt about that. Very, very, very, very big town. But nothing compared to London. All the roads, all weird. All medieval. We got medieval stuff. Don't get me wrong, our medieval stuff's better than their medieval stuff. But our medieval stuff's easier to drive around. Do you know what I mean? Listen, oi, you'll love this. I had a geezer in earlier, sitting there casual as you like, browsing through a porno mag. Nothing horrible, just your basic top-shelf shit, you know what I mean. But still, I mean, that ain't normal behavior is it? Eh? What? Porno mag, in a taxi, ain't normal, is it? And that's got me thinking. Who reads porno mags anyway, these days, eh? It's all for free on the Internet, innit? You don't need it. Who would volunteer that? Go into a shop, pick up a magazine, then you've gotta pay for it. Surely, that is humiliating but people must do it, otherwise they wouldn't be there, all stacked up, proud as punch, in all their glory. - Are you all right, mate? - Huh? Only you don't look too good, if you don't mind me saying. Shitty day. All right, brother. We've all had 'em. We've all had 'em. Get a haircut, man! Who are you? Matt. Fuck off, Matt. I'm here for Keon. What do you want? Just, uh... some drugs. Drugs? Anything in particular? Cannabis. Are you police? No. No. I'm just fucking with you. Police wouldn't have looked like a limp dick. Keon's asleep, but I'll... Sort you out. Enter. Wait in here. Jesus, can you smell yourself? When was the last time you took a fucking bath? Get in there. Sit. Sit. Fucking sit! Fucking pricks. You all right? You all right? Oh, god. Oh, my god, Anna. I'm so, so sorry. And I didn't... I didn't know, babe. I swear I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You got a smoke? You got a smoke? Hmm? You got a smoke? I'm fucking talking to you! - Do you understand what I'm saying? You understand? Get to fuck, you Mong! Oh, my god. What you doing? Uh... I need to use the toilet. You should have gone in the lift. Get a move on. You two, wait in here. Hey, where's my fucking phone, man? Hey, where's my fucking phone, man? How the fuck do I know? Give me a tip. What's this fool sleeping for? Hello, sweetheart. Who are them two? Punters, man. Yeah? How long am I gonna have these fucking white boys in my living room for? I'll deal with 'em now. Hey, have you seen my phone? What did you want? Um... Uh, one, one bag. One bag? Yeah. What the fuck is a one bag? You know, just... One bag. I'll give you a special. Heavy smokers only. Three grams for 120 quid. It's pollen. It'll fluff out. Fuck's sake. You can owe me. Hey! You take my phone? You take my fucking phone? Well, someone did. Someone took my fucking phone. This'll be fun. Hey, listen, am I a fucking dickhead? You playing that fucking game while I'm talking? Where's my phone? Where's my phone, huh? And what the fuck are you laughing at? Huh? - You think it's funny? - I wasn't laughing. No one is leaving here until I get my shit. You understand? You think this is a fucking joke? Huh? Him. The other one. Get up. Do you have my shit? Do you have my shit? No. No? Well, someone does. Where's the other white boy? Huh? You understand me? You understand a word coming out of my mouth? Huh? Where is the other white boy? Ah, you. Where the fuck have you been? Hmm? Where the fuck have you been, boy? Hmm? - You stole my phone. Huh? - Huh? You stole my phone. Yeah. He stole my fucking phone. You stole my fucking phone! Where is it? Where the fuck is it? Where is it? Where's my fucking phone? Where's my phone? Where is it? Where's my... He took my phone. - Have you been robbed? - Yeah. I've been robbed. I had it when I went in the room. Now it's gone. Where is it? - I don't know! I don't know! - Don't fuck with me. - Where's my phone? - I didn't take no one's phone. Yeah, shut up. I know what he's done. I know what he's done. I saw him dropping the stuff to his mates through the window in that room. That's what you fucking did, didn't you, you motherfucker? I'm gonna go down. I'm gonna go down and speak to his mates. I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna roughen 'em up. Roughen 'em up. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna fucking sort 'em out. Oi! Oh, shit! You fucking prick! Come on. Shit! Shit, shit, shit! Get him! Come on. You gonna order something, boss? Yeah, I'll get a double beef Bangla burger. With chips, yeah? I'm all right. 5.50, Bruv. I didn't want any Mayo. - It's garlic sauce, innit? - I don't want any. Give me another burger without mayonnaise. It's not Mayo. It's garlic sauce. Give me another burger! What, what is it? Are you the manager? Yeah. Sorry, um... Is there a problem? Can I use your toilet? Yeah. Down the hall. What's going on? What is the problem? Stupid customer, innit? Wait! What are you doing? Don't call the customer stupid. Don't think about customers like that. You get out! Bloody waste of space! You gonna order something, Bruv? Yeah, I'll get a double beef Bangla burger. - With chips, yeah? - I'm all right. Your clothes. Off. Just fucking get it done! Hey... What is that back there? What were you watching? - What is that? - Watching? Yeah. Nothing. I'm not watching anything. - What are you doing there? - I saw you earlier filming me. You're part of this, aren't you? I want you out. Get out! Get back! Get back! Get back! Get back! Drop the ladle! Drop the ladle. Drop it. Is this a game? Huh? Is this a game you bet on? Huh? Take my girlfriend, nearly kill me, for a fucking game? Are you a part of this? Who are you? I just make the burgers. I know nothing. This isn't real. None of it's been real. This gun is... Isn't gonna kill anyone. It's not even real. You fucking... Shit! - You motherfucking... You shot my leg! - I'm sorry. - You fucker! Mother... - I'm so... - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - You fucker! You motherfucking Bhenchod! He shot my bloody leg! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! I'm sorry, Anna. I'm sorry for everything. You're an arsehole. Come on then! No! Get your fucking hands off me! No! No! No! No! Fucking... fuck! No! No! No! No! No! Hello, Matthew. Well done. It's over. She's just through that door. You should be proud. You got to see who you really are. It's been fun. Anna! Anna! Anna? No. Is this what you want? For me to kill someone? Is this what you want? I want to know who I am. You don't have to do this. I do. Oh. Matt, what... What's happened to you? Matt! What's happened to you? Matt, please... What's happened to your face? Who has done this to you? Matt, please. Matt... Matt. What are you looking at? Look at me. What happened to you?
