I've been calling out for hours. I was sleeping, I didn't notice you'd disappeared. Are you hurt? No. But it's freezing, the water's up to my knees. It's heavy, or stuck. Can you reach the opening? You think I haven't tried? It's too high. Okay, I'm throwing you a lighter. There's blood on your face. I didn't even notice. - Is it serious? I don't think so. What kind of a psychopath builds a trap you can't open? Trap? What trap? -Relax, relax. Must be someone hunting foxes or rabbits or something. All this for a rabbit? There's got to be a trick here, a lever or something. This is punishment. What? For running away. Where do you come up with this nonsense? It's a trap, it was dark, you fell, it could happen to anyone. But it happened to me. -Yeah, but you're not dead, you didn't break anything, you've only got a little scratch. Punishment? Seems more like a miracle to me. I want to go home. We're not going home. Telling Dad was a mistake. -A mistake? Would you rather continue hiding like two criminals? As if we were doing something wrong? Maybe we are doing something wrong. There's nothing wrong about what we're doing. You hear me? Nothing. You know how much I love you. And I love you. Okay, then I'm going to get you out of here now, but only if you really want me to. You know me, I don't like forcing anyone. Okay? Can you hear me from there? -Yeah. Ofer? Ofer? Ofer! RABlES I can't listen to this anymore, I'm changing stations. Why are you getting so upset? They're just two rich kids who ran away from home. Why is everything always a joke with you? I bet something bad happened to them. These stories always end badly. -It'll end with a new SUV. If you had kids, you wouldn't be joking around like that. I have one little girl, that's plenty. Oh, so I'm the little girl here? And what does that make you? -What? A foetus. That's right. Okay, let's get to work. Will you miss me? Not sure. I'll be back here in 20 minutes. Menashe, be serious. You have an evaluation to do. But Rona, my muscles ache from last night. Honey-bun, unless you want your muscles to ache tonight too, you'll do as I tell you. -All right... But talk to me the whole way. Promise. Have I told you how much I hate those sunglasses? Sure have. -And you keep wearing them. I have no choice, Rona. You blind me. Blind me. You always know exactly what to say to me every morning to melt my heart. Kiss. I'll miss you. Bye, Buba. Bye, Buba. Buba, say goodbye to Mommy. Buba, did you hear that? He called me Mommy. Look... Look at him starting to sweat. Buba, take care of Casanova for me, okay? Bye, honey-bun. -Bye, sweetie-pie. Would you focus on the map instead of the mirror? You've got to see this, it's better than a movie. There should be a right turn here somewhere. Take a right here. Oh no, did I do that? It's okay, it'll dry. Did you sleep well? -Yeah. Where are we? I don't know. Are you sure this is the way? Yes. -No. Are you kidding me? It's your fault, why did you give me the map? I'm driving, Pini, Whoever is next to the driver is in charge of the map, that's how it works. Oh, that's the new rule? Don't piss me off, Pini. -Okay, I got confused, big deal. This whole area is only an inch on the map, -I don't think so. I played at that court last year and this isn't the way. But it's pretty here. -Yeah, it's really nice. Yes, Adi, but this isn't National Geographic, so do me a favour and take a look at the map. Forget the map, let's look for a sign, there's always a sign. If this forest doesn't turn into buildings within 1 0 minutes, I'm turning back. Buba! Don't go too far. Cleanliness. Check. Play area? Check. Where's the stick? What kind of a dog comes back without the stick? You're tired too? Cigarette break. What? Just one. One. You're smoking, aren't you? Don't be ridiculous. Thanks, Buba. That's your last one for today, you hear me? I hear you... Menashe. You're such a rat. This is the last time you're coming with me. Buba, don't go too far. Buba! Seriously, I have to pee, I can't hold it in anymore. Mike, stop the car. -Here? Here, pee in this. And how is that supposed to happen? You should know by now that girls have different plumbing. Unless you're still... a virgin. No way. My cherry's long gone. -What? What? I see. Mike, is your cherry long gone too? What? What's the problem? Nothing. Pini's a virgin. Lesbian. You'd better stop, Shir is about to pee in your car. Okay, I'm stopping. Is here okay? Yes, just stop already. Open it! Can I help you? Don't peek, okay? -Of course not. I'm serious. -So am l. Make sure they don't peek. Go on, run. I'll tell you when we can't see. Run. We can't see. Stop it. -You stop it. Can you see me? -You can pee now! You little liar. If I can see her, so can you. I don't know what you're talking about. -Can you believe her, Mikey? Shir, go a little further. You guys are jerks. Come on, Mikey, watching a girl pee is the sexiest thing in the world. Okay, maybe not the sexiest, but it's definitely in my top-five Peeing? It really turns you on? -Yeah, in a weird kind of way, because it's not supposed to be sexy, but when a girl does it, it's sexy. And how many peeing girls have you seen? How many have you? You wish you knew. I can't believe I'm asking, Pini, but what are the other top-four? You're really getting into it, huh? Cool. This is the list, but it's not in order of preference because it's hard for me to decide. -Must be really hard. Stop interrupting. -Shoot. The first thing is: a girl peeing. At home, outdoors, in the shower, swimming pool. Swimming pool? How can you tell? The smile gives you away. Okay, the second thing is... -What's with the fingers? Maybe he's afraid he'll miscount. It's all the way up to five. It's for the dramatic effect. Such big words for such a small mouth... and a dirty one. -What's with Shir? She's taking her time, huh? -Never rush a lady. Shir! What's taking you so long? Leave her be! Finish your speech in the meantime. -Okay, where was l? Oh yeah. The second sexiest thing is a girl shaving her legs. Give me a break. I agree, it really is sexy. -What's so sexy about shaving? Not just any shaving. If you were shaving your arm, hint-hint, or your face, that would be nasty. Would you rather they stayed hairy? -No, but don't include me in the process. But a girl shaving her legs... There's something about a razor sliding down... Get your foot away from me. Come on, Pini... It stinks. -Wait, what about wax? No good, it hurts, you make nasty faces, not good. Okay, the third sexiest thing is... We didn't peek at all. I don't care. I didn't pee in the end. All this time and nothing? -You guys stressed me out. Then I heard noises coming from the forest, I couldn't concentrate. You weren't doing a crossword puzzle! -I just couldn't. I was afraid something would jump out at me from the bushes. Ofer? Shir, stay back. Don't look. Shit. Look at him. He's a goner. Go check his pulse. I looked by accident. I think I'm going to faint. I don't get it, he waved his hands, then jumped in front of the car. Why is he dressed like that? I think we ran over a waiter. I looked again! Go check his pulse. Just don't move him, we don't want to break anything else. Anything else? The guy is totaled. You all right? Did you run me over? What gave us away? Yes, no, not on purpose, you jumped into the road. Wait, where are you going? We need to call an ambulance. She's in the forest, she's still in the forest. Who's in the forest? My sister. She fell into a hole in the ground. I couldn't get her out, so I came running for help and then you showed up. What should we do? We'll call for help and wait. -No, she's hurt, there's no time. Do you know where she is? -Yes. Get real, he can barely stand up. I'm okay. -Yeah, you're a real hero. Pini, if he says he's okay, he's okay. Okay. -We'll go with him, you stay here, we'll be back soon, meanwhile get on the phone. Yeah, tell them we won't make it to the match. I meant to the police. -Yeah, them too. Buba! do you copy? Dispatch, this is 320, I copy. Proceed to the fox reserve, ASAP. Isn't it closed? Some kids got lost there. The girl that called in sounded confused. A confused girl? She also said something about an accident. Inquire, ASAP. Okay, we're on our way. Yuval to Danny, do you copy? I've asked you not to make personal calls on duty. Turning your back on me When I'm talking to you? Okay, if I have no choice, I have no choice. That was a long call, do I smell a happy ending? I wish, She's not answering me. Did you leave a message? -Six, so far today. The more, the merrier. Yuval... -Danny. Yuval. -Danny. Yuval. -Danny. What's so urgent? What happened? Some kids got lost in the fox reserve. Okay, let's go. Come on. Aren't you going to answer that? I'm driving, you want me to get a ticket? What is it, another fatherhood claim? Something like that, it's Shimshon. -Your dad? I wrecked his car last night, he probably just found out and wants to let me have it. -So you're not answering him? Until things cool down at Shimshon Beach. Shimshon. Who calls his father by his first name? If you called him Dad, things would be different between you. Yes, Dad. Go. Are we there yet, Grandpa Smurf? We really have come a long way. You know where you're going? Yeah, just stay on the path. Follow me. Come on. I hope his sister is worth it. Buba? No... Menashe? This is Menashe, over. Where were you? You had me worried. Rona, listen... -Babe, is that you? "Babe"? Is there something you want to tell me? She doesn't mean me, it's a girl I found unconscious in the forest. And you expect me to believe that? Why would I make it up? Then put her on, I want to hear it from her. Oh please... Rona, she passed out again. Oh, she passed out again. You expect me to buy that? Idiot. Rona, do you read me? I don't have time for these games. Rona, this isn't funny. Stay by the car, girls. Stay by the car. Do I look okay? My hair, uniform, everything in place? You just don't learn, huh? Don't forget what happened last time. -Yeah, but check them out. You listen to me. Go over there, ask them what happened, and put an end to all this. Put an end to all this, finally words I can identify with. If you keep this up, I'm coming with you. -I'm just kidding. You stay here. It's been a while since you tried reaching her. It'll be okay. Hi, you've reached Shani. Leave a message after the beep. Beep. Hi, my darling. You aren't answering your mobile, so I called you at home. I hope you listen to this message all the way to the end. I don't even know where to start. I know what I did hurt you and that things don't look good, not good at all. I can understand you're feeling a lot of anger and you may not be able to find any room to love me within all that anger, but... Rona, do you read me? Rona, do you read me? Rona, the truck is dead, I have an unconscious girl, I'm taking her to the trailer. Rona! Rona! I don't know, what do you say? -Sounds farfetched to me. Would you just listen to us? -We've heard enough. And you still don't get what's going on? Are you angry? You sound angry. No, she's not angry. But she did tell you everything. Everything, huh? -Yes, everything. There's a girl who fell into a hole and her brother is hurt. And your two friends went to help him find her. Exactly. So can you help us? Yeah, but you must understand our side too. What I see here is a car with blood on it, two girls without a scratch or the car keys. Yes, but we called you. But we have no way of knowing it's really you. Then what are you going to do? Maybe I should search the car, the whole shebang. We'll go by the book. By the book. You don't seem like the reading type. You'd be surprised to know what I like doing. And what I don't. She's not in there. She's not in there, someone took her out. Someone took her! I'm sure she's okay. Someone must've helped her out, right, Pini? Mikey, this dog was slashed from ear to ear, what kind of a psychopath would do that? And to a dog? Tali? We have to find her. No, we have to get out of here, Mikey. Let's go back to the girls, they must've called the police, let them deal with this. I'm not leaving here. You're hurt, it'll be dark soon, she's probably fine. At this rate we'll need a rescue team too. Tali! I'll call the girls to see when help will get here. He's going to wake up the whole forest. Can I answer that? -No. Maybe it's the boys? -Especially if it's the boys. Aren't you a bit too close? -What's wrong? You jealous? You wish. -Not your type, huh? Okay, no offense taken. I could tell as soon as I got out of the car that you prefer her. Am I right, Navratilova? -Shut up! Whoa, I touched a nerve. What about you? You like Navratilova? -Leave her alone. What's wrong? Afraid to hear the answer? You're really enjoying this, huh? Whatever you can't get yourself, your uniform gets for you. Stop it, Adi, you're just annoying him. Let them do their job. Their job? I bet they jerked each other off watching porno before coming here. Keep talking like that and you'll never forget this day. What did I miss? -Your friend sexually harassing us. Shut up. -Yuval, chill. I touched a nerve. Isn't there some kind of procedure in cases like this? Of course there is, my darling. That's why I'm running some tests on the computer. And l, girls, am going to search you, so is there anything you want to tell me? Anything I don't want to find? Anything... sharp? Anything pointy? You're searching us? Are you nuts? It's procedure, you know. I tried both of them. And? -No answer. I bet they ran off with the cops. Let's get out of here, Mikey. And leave him all alone? What do I care? I don't even know his name. Ofer. You think he heard everything I said? I can still hear. He's a real X-Man. We have to keep looking. We have to go into the forest. We have to find her before it gets dark. Going into the forest is way out of my depth, so thanks a lot, but I'm out of here, Mikey, you coming? You coming? -Wait, stop! Are you threatening me? Don't move. What do you want? Are you threatening me? He's not threatening you, Pini. Don't move. Now you're taking his side? -No, don't be an idiot, look down. I can't. What is it, a spider? A snake? Tell me it's not a snake! It's not a snake, just look down! Fuck, it's not fair, why do I always get screwed? I told you we should've stayed with the girls! Would you take it easy down there? I swear, if you keep... -Adi, it's okay. Did you hear that? It's okay. Get your filthy hands off her. Look at her, she's about to cry! Would you get over here? Your friend is going way too far! I'd chill if I were you, sweetie. Who do you think you're yelling at? Don't worry, Pini, it's all rusty. Looks ancient. If it hasn't worked so far, it probably won't. It works, it works. -How do you know?. I hope you got a tetanus shot. When did you develop a sense of humour? What should we do? Hey, what are you talking about? I'm a goner, right? I'm a goner. Give it to me straight. You're not a goner, not even close, relax. We're just trying to see how to get you out of this. Why don't I just jump out? No. Do you know anything about these things? It looks like a bear trap. The minute your friend lifts his leg... Oh my god. Bears? There are bears around here? Is my leg shaking? I feel my leg shaking. Check if my leg is shaking, I feel it shaking. Listen, this is what we're going to do: You grab one side of the trap, I'll grab the other side, Pini jumps on three. Wait, where do I jump? Up. Okay. -Okay? On three. On three. Three? -On three. One... two... How did this happen? I don't know, she's fast. -What have you done? As if you don't know. He was groping her. I bet this is your regular routine. You turn a blind eye and he gets finger-happy. Shir, come here. Maybe she doesn't want to come? Maybe she liked it? Yuval, shut up! You've gotten us into enough trouble, okay? All I did was search her. Son of a bitch! Get your hands off of her and step back! Calm down, that gun could be very dangerous, it could be loaded. It is loaded. Are you crazy? Why is it loaded? I'm always loaded and ready for action. Besides, you think she'll shoot me? A cop? That's a great headline for tomorrow: "Navratilova Kills Cop." Move away from her. Besides, she can't shoot me. You know why? Because it's my gun, and no one shoots my gun except me. Move away from her. Shir, come here! I told you, she doesn't want to. You don't want to, do you? Fuck off. Say what? Calm down, what's with you guys? What did you say to me? -Don't listen to him, you have the gun, you're the boss. -No, she's just a little girl. Ignore him, relax, take a deep breath, take your finger off the trigger. It's way more sensitive than you can imagine. Way-way more sensitive than you can imagine. All you have to do is blow on it. Are you out of your mind? Can't you see she's scared? Yeah, but I don't give a damn. They're all the same, little teasers. With their short skirts and see-through tops, playing games. But when it gets real, suddenly they're scared. Suddenly it's: "Stop it, Yuval, you're hurting me, Yuval." "I'm about to cry." You're going to cry tonight, I promise you that. And you, grow some balls, grab your gun and shoot the bitch? You too? Hands up! Okay, I've fucking had it, I want my gun back. We said at three, Pini! One, two, three! Don't yell at me! He got us into this mess! He's hurt, get off of him! Can you believe that little shit? Hurt, my ass. Look how fast he's running. Let him go. -I bet he doesn't even have a sister. Look what you did! You fucking bitch, look what you did. I'm looking. Shir, wake up and come here. And you, hands up. You fucking bitch, look what you did. Yeah, I'm glad, let's see you use them next time. What's so funny? I'm left-handed. You are so fucked-up. Shir. Shir, come on! Calm down, apply pressure on it, you're losing blood. Tali! Tali! They're all here. Bravo. Ouch, fuck! We've got to get you to a hospital, they'll reattach them. Oh yeah? And how will you explain that? It doesn't matter, you need medical attention, we'll worry about that later. -Right, later. With you it's always later, never in the hour of need. Maybe that's why your wife doesn't answer your calls? What was that? -You heard me. How long does it take to pull out your gun and shoot a little bitch? Bitch? She's just a girl who's scared. Scared? That slut blew off two of my fingers. You should've popped her, not once, not twice, but three times. You've totally lost it, we've got to get you to a hospital, so they can reattach your fingers. Actually, it's not you who should've popped her, it's me. Teach her a lesson, all of them. What are you doing? Stop it, you're nuts. You're nuts, man! Come on! You're not serious, Yuval! You've done enough damage for one day, you're totally insane, man! There's no turning back now, I can't cover for you anymore. Exactly, someone has to clean up this mess. So you're going to take out two little girls? Are you nuts? You watch too many movies, I just want to scare them a little. You've scared them enough. Let's talk this over and think what we should do, it'll be okay. Don't go anywhere. -What are you doing? Those are my house keys! Which house is that? Son of a bitch! Leave my mother out of it. Wait. What? Why did you stop? -I can't go on. We can't stop now, we have to find the boys. I can't, I have to pee. You're joking. No, I've been holding it in this whole time. Okay, then go, what are you waiting for? What? I want to thank you for what happened back there. Thank me when we get out of jail. You think they'll come after us? I think one of them will. Give me the phone. I'll tell you when I can't see. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Dispatch, dispatch. Danny, is that you? Danny, answer me. Come on, Danny, answer me. What's going on? Mike? -Adi? Mike, can you hear me? Are you okay? We heard a gunshot. We're okay, sort of. Stay by the car, We'll be right there. No, we're not there. We had a run-in with some cops, we're on our way to you. I can't hear you... Adi? What? Hello? Mike? Hello? Shir? Shir! -I'm almost done. Shir, look. "DANGER MlNES!" I can't stop now. What should we do? Do you have much more to go? -Yeah, I drank a whole bottle. Okay, don't move. Wait! -What? I'm done. -That's it? Yeah. -Don't move! What? You don't seriously think these mines are still active? No, probably not, but... That's all I needed to hear. What are you doing? You're crazy, stop! You nearly gave me a heart attack. Are you all right? -I want to go home. Me too. Adi! Where are you going? The road is that way. To find the girls. -You have no idea where they are. Listen to me. We're looking for them, they're looking for us, let's head back to the road and meet them there. I don't know if they're there, something happened with the cops. What could happen? -I don't know, but we have to find Shir. You mean Shir and Adi. What about Adi? You're cool without Adi? No, I meant Shir and Adi. -Yeah, but you said Shir. What, you're into her too? Of course not. -Mike, what's going on? Nothing's going on. -I know you when you're like this. You want to tell me something? -This isn't the time, Pini. You bet it is, now talk! Talk! We're together. What? You heard me, we're together. You're together? What, you fucked her? You fucked her? You know I'm crazy about her and you go behind my back and fuck her without telling me? -Look how you're reacting. How could anyone tell you anything? You're nuts. "What does everyone see in Shir? We're just friends," sound familiar, you son of a bitch? I tell you what I want to do to her and you go and do it? How long have you been doing her? I'm not answering that. -How long have you been doing her? I'm not answering that. -I want to know! I'm not answering that. The girl's hysterical, let's go! Of course she's hysterical, she can't cope without her man. I meant Adi, you idiot. Are you coming or not? No, I'm not, since I won't be getting laid on this trip, now it's all about survival. -Coward. Cool, maybe I am a coward, but I'm not an idiot like you. With all these traps and guns, I'd rather get back to the road. And away from your stink. Come on, chill! Hate me when we get back. Come on. Mike, I'm going back to the car, okay? And if those girls have any sense, which at least one of them does, they'll do the same. Okay. Fine. I'll manage on my own. See you later, wait for me by the car. Give me the keys. -I'm not giving you the keys. How am I supposed to get in? -I'm not giving you the keys. What if you fall into a hole or a trap? Who'll get you out? I'll be stuck in the car like a jerk, now give me the keys. No. Mikey, give me the keys, in case something happens to you. What'll happen? You heard Ofer. If you stay on the path, it's okay. Oh yeah, because Ofer looks okay! Pini, if you want to come, fine. If not, fuck off, okay? I'm not giving you the keys! -Oh yeah? Yeah. Give me the keys, Mike. -No. Pini, leave me alone. -Give me the keys. I said, leave me alone. -Give me the keys! You sure you want to take a beating? Take this! Mike, stop... Shir, find the gun. -Don't move, you hear me? Don't listen to him, Shir, keep looking. -I said, don't move. Fuck you. All in due time. I told you I'd make you cry, didn't l? Found it. Shoot him! Shoot him! Come on, shoot him! I'm no doctor, but I'd say she's in shock. And you're under arrest. Yeah, my diagnosis says you're going to jail for a long time, so the sooner you stop resisting arrest, the faster we'll get out of here. Shir, what's wrong with you? I think she likes seeing you squirm. Or did I get the roles wrong? I bet you like being on top. Watching your little blonde whimper. Yuval? Where are you? This isn't funny. Yuval? What are you doing? -Where are the fucking keys? Cold, cold, cold... Warm, warmer, hot. You're a clown to the end, huh? Shir, is that yours? No, I have a different ring tone. It's mine. Hello? You son of a bitch, you thought I wouldn't notice? That I wouldn't see? That I've gone blind? Senile? That's what you thought, you loser? Shimshon? -It's wrecked! It'll take me weeks to fix. Do you have any idea how much it'll cost, you nobody? You did it on purpose. -No, Dad. Oh, all of a sudden it's "Dad"? What happened to "Shimshon"? Just like when you were a kid, you feel the belt getting closer and all of a sudden it's "Dad"? There is no "Dad", Yuval, and there 's no Shimshon that you can bring your whores to either. I swear, if you come anywhere near my house in your patrol car, I'll beat the shit out of you. You don't have to worry about that anymore. Hey, guess who? This must be the 20th message I've left, and to be honest, I'm getting sick of this. Shir? Shir, can you hear me? Hello, Mike? Listen, Pini is hurt, I'm going to the car to get the first-aid kit, okay? All day I've begged and apologized, I'm down on my knees, I'd do anything just to talk to you. Just one more time, before it's too late. Before there's no turning back. I can't hear you. Just take Adi and head back towards the road, okay? What? I can't hear you. Shir, I can't hear you. Was I asking too much? A little warmth at the end of the day? Even a hug would've done the trick, but you had to be so cold, as if I'd done something bad to you, which I ended up doing. So that for once you'd feel like me, and for once... you'd know what it feels like when someone tramples on your heart. I can't hear you, just head back towards the road, okay? I can't hear you, Shir, just take Adi and go back to the car. Shir? I finally got under your frozen skin. Now you can't be cold towards me anymore. There's no more room for your fucking apathy. What did you do to her? What did you do to her? Nothing, I didn't do anything! I saved her, she's in the trailer. Tali. Are you okay? Did he hurt you? -No, I don't think so. We have to get out of here. Ofer... Don't worry. He can't hurt you anymore. Ofer, what have you done? That's not him. Yes, it is. I saw him carrying you. Ofer, what have you done? What are you doing? He's heavy, grab his legs. -I'm not grabbing his legs. Grab his legs. Tali! He's too heavy, I can't. I have to rest for a minute. Don't cry. It'll be all right. What'll be all right? What a screwed-up day. How did this happen? I killed someone today. It wasn't your fault. I know that. But he's a cop, I'm going to jail. I've ruined my life. No, you haven't! Who knows what would've happened with those two jerks? At least this one got what he deserved. I'm pretty sure there's something called self defence. Self defence? Yeah, self defence. What would I do without you? You saved us today. Don't exaggerate. I'm not, seriously. You were amazing. Did you hear that? It means the road is near. Maybe it's the boys. -Yeah, maybe. Go run and see who it is. -What? No, not alone, let's go together. -No, Shir, we'll miss them. No way, I'm not going alone, I'm scared. Then take the gun.

I wasn't expecting... I called you and... -Wait, before you say anything, I just want to apologize, okay? I was at my parents' all day and when you called this morning I hung up because I was afraid they'd see I answered. I just heard the message you left me. The one from this morning?
