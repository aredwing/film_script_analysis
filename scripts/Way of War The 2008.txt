I'd say, "Yes, Bill, it does mean something to the soldlers injured and killed and their families. ...and they're parading things in to try to get public opinion to shift against it. The point is Iraq started before Halliburton. This goes back to the Kissinger era, and is just now bearing fruit for a lot of these guys. It's not just U. S. military over there. It's Black Water, Triple Canopy, in what thousands of speclal ops we're never going to know. Redesign of the conduct of the war. This has been confirmed. It is expected that... We are convinced that it was necessary and rlghteous... I'd like to begin with an apology. Obviously, we all have better ways of bringing in the new year. Well, everyone... except you, Denise. This time last week, on Christmas Eve, our Department received intelligence reports indicating the whereabouts of the Ace of Spades. Three brave American soldiers acted on that intelligence and killed him. Excuse me. However, it is with great sadness that I report to you that the soldiers involved in that operation all lost their lives in it. Now I'm not at liberty to release their names at this time, but I ask every American to please keep these three heroes in their prayers this evening. Now this, this is not an end to the war on terror. We fear it may merely be a new beginning. As a result, we have raised the threat level effective immediately. Now the President and Vice President will return from holiday on Tuesday. They've asked your networks for one hour on Thursday to brief the nation. Any questions you have will be answered at that time. Now, as we... as we enter the New Year, let us pray that this will be the year that sees an end to global tyranny, and delivers world peace. I bid you all a good night, a Happy New Year, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Mr. Secretary! As was stated, the President gets back on Tuesday, and will address the nation on Thursday. Sir. Sir! He popped up. Excuse me? He popped up. When? About an hour ago. Oh, Christ. It came from Texas. We thought it would affect your statement. And? They've washed their hands, sir. They've said it's time for you to clean it. Now why do you look so pleased? Where? On a bus. From New York to Washington. Hm. You believe in him, don't you? No, the luxury of believing in any one man has a price tag someone like me cannot afford. But... I believe that we trained a man without moral conviction, devoid of reason. Given that, it makes it far more serious. Question: What becomes of a highly trained, motivated murderer who sprouts a conscience? Infamy? Mm, to some, perhaps. But perhaps he becomes something else to those in Texas, to me, to his country, with what he's seen, what he's heard, what he thinks he knows, he becomes something far worse. Which is? A fire, if you will, that neither you nor I can extinguish. He becomes a legend. Who's on the bus? Seven and Eleven. Oh, isn't that cute. Irony, sir. It's what gets me through the day. Phone Seven. Tell him to tag him. Sir? If he kills him, then what? Right now, he's just a whisper in the wind. They die, his voice can only get louder. We have the luxury of position and time. He does not. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. Special Agent Robinson. I don't mean to disturb you but I'm conducting a test, a drill, for the Department of Homeland Security. Now nothing is wrong. This is simply a drill. Now that we've arrived in Washington D. C., I need to see how quickly you can exit the bus. The cost of your tickets will be refunded. My goal is to find out if this was a real emergency, how long it would take. It starts... now. Let's go, folks. Sit. ... missed him. In clearing up this war in Iraq... Ace of Spades. What'd you just say? Ace of Spades. Seeing is believing, my friend. Why is it always him? It's in English, Sanchez. Rastrero. Northern Pakistan. It's too obvious. I don't like it. Well, you don't like anything. Just give me the odds. Two to four. Keep reading. So Junior says fifty fifty, my hombre. You know, a wise man once said, "Knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, "in every battle, certain victory. "Knowing oneself, not knowing the enemy, "one victory for one loss. "But not knowing oneself, "and not knowing the enemy, in every battle, certain defeat. " Who was it? Sun Tzu, The Art of War. These days I say fifty fifty. An eye for an eye. It's about as good as it's gonna get. The call came out for heroes, boys. The three wise men on high, smelled, touched, saw, and came to the conclusion of whom they should call. I say we send out a message telling the children to cover their eyes, the women to shut their legs, and the men to put up their fists, because a war machine is coming. We roll in 55 minutes, gentlemen. Let's burn this shit hole down. Merry fucking Christmas. Plans for carrying out this war in Iraq... Look, we're just doing our job, alright? I don't know what you did, I don't care. No, not yet. Now if you want to live, then stay off the grid. Where's my cash? Just give me the location of my box and then I go away. Choice one: what's done is done. If I were you, I'd make like a tree. If not, go through door number two and open the envelope. Either road you choose, I'd find a way to stay lost. Hey. Good evening. Hey, Samir, a little heat back here? It depends. Good tip? Where to? Two stops. First, the Mayflower. Hey, I'm hip. Have fun. Take your time. They have the best girls in town. I say nothing. Take the access road and park in the alley. Keep it running. Don't kill the lights. In 10 minutes, pull the car around front. Please don't take another fare. Just a quickie? Club soda. Dry. But the point is Iraq started before Halliburton. This goes back to the Kissinger era, and is just now bearing fruit for a lot of these guys. It's not just U. S. military over there. It's Black Water, Triple Canopy, in what thousands of speclal ops What can I get you? I'll have a club soda. Dry. A Club Soda, no... no vodka, or... I can't help you with that. Those are the rules, cowboy. If you have a problem with it, you can talk to him. I'll have a bourbon on the rocks. That I can do. Weird, don't you think? He sat there the whole night watching you, doesn't order anything. And then at closing time he comes up, orders one drink and leaves. Looks like you may have your first male crush. I don't get you. How come? Well, you sat there all night with some creepy gay guy clearly watching you, you don't say a word, you don't look at the stage, and worst of all, you haven't even looked at me. I'm looking at you now. Buy me another? Of course. Last call! I'm a-goin' down to the cellar. You want the box on? Now you be good. What's in the cellar? You don't wanna know. Hey, Crush, it's time to go home. Thank you. Ooh. So. So. What's your story, cowboy? You don't wanna know. Don't move. Don't move. For the next 15 minutes, I'm gonna call you lollipop. Any issues? Okay, lollipop, I have a very simple question. I'm pretty sure you know what it is. Where is my cash? That's it, that's it, scream all you want. You and I both know no one can hear you in this room. And from the looks of things, I'm sure all I have left in life is time and the pleasure of your voice. Oh, come on! I got two kids, man. I'll never have any. Now where did they hide my box? They were wrong. Now ask me how come. How come. It's doesn't take three licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. Now please, tell me where my cash is. Six... 66 Benning Road, man. They said you'd know where. Look me in the eye and say that again. Sixty-six Benning Road. That's all they told me. Bring your mouth to the hole. Bring your mouth to the hole!! I can't. It'll kill me!! Soda water doesn't kill people. I kill people. Why? I had a friend once. She used to call me Lobo. How was she? Sixty-six Benning Road. My friend, I'm from Libya. We play football with our feet. I coach team. Win six games. How many quarterbacks do you need? You're not from here. Everyone from here, even gay, love Redskins. Oh. You're a cowboy. Hey, fuck you, 3. 95, you walk. You're like me with my wife. That's why I talk so much at work. Crazy bitch. Nobody can get a word in edgewise. Hey, man, I go to the movies. I'm hip, I'm cool, I'm down. I'll be your homeboy tonight. Let me guess. You're a drug dealer from New York. And that duffel bag is full of rocks. You're going to sell to M13. It's cool. Who? Ah! He speaks. You know, M13. The, how you say, gang. The thugs. It's beautiful tonight. World War II memorial. They haven't finished it. There's only one way for a war memorial to truly be finished. Everyone dies. When they were planning to build, the people, they flight constantly. "It's gonna destroy them all. " "Put it next to Vietnam or over by RFK." How soon we forget to honor the good and punish the wrong. Don't you think? Pull over here on the bridge. Right here. For some, It's hard to believe. What's that? That the people back there, they have too much. And the people, right here, one mile away, they have not enough. Pull over right here on the bridge. I promised you a good tip. You better go. Padre Nuestro, que ests en el cielo... santificado sea Tu nombre... I think we're all prayed out, Sanchez. Hey! It'd be sweet without the sour. Nah. It wouldn't be sour without the sweet. You still ain't figured it out yet, kid. What's that? You're still young. You got time. More fun figuring it out on your own. Yes and no. Here we are, in the middle of the biggest gang war in the history of the world. So I guess it wasn't about defending Lady Liberty? In the beginning. You and I both know, sir, we gave up defending Lady Liberty a long time ago. You know, when we pull this off, you guys have an out. Why do you think I was so smiley when we played shoot 'n tell earlier? Right, then what? Then back to the D. C. To the devil I know. At least there, on those streets, I think I know who the bad guys are. What about you? I don't know. No! May I help you? Have you seen those men before? Is that your daughter? What can I do for you? I need you to get under the counter. So, a great general is killed after a long battle, by his enemy's sword, he gets to the gates of heaven, he looks through and he sees former presidents, kings and queens, his parents, seated at this long table. Saint Peter approaches, introduces himself, the general asks him, " How do I get in? How do I walk through those gates?" Saint Peter says, "Well, you have to spell a word. " The general asks, "What is the word?" St. Peter says, "The word is 'love. "' The general spells it and St. Peter welcomes him in. About a year later, St. Peter comes up to the general and says, "I need you to watch the gates for me today. " A little while later, sure enough, he sees a man approaching, he walks toward the gate, so he recognizes his enemy, the man who killed him. They talk for a minute, his enemy apologizes, and then he asks, "How do I get in?" The general thinks for just a second, he says, "You have to spell a word. " So the enemy asks, "What is the word?" The general says 'Czechoslovakia. ' Let's go. I thought you'd be bigger. But I guess that's the way it is with legends. Reality's always less. Who did it? What difference does it make? Who did it? The United States government owes me that much. We're soldiers. We follow orders. Hey. Stay. What are you doing? Stay!! What do you think I'm doing? Trying to find a short-term answer to a long-term problem. You make that call, you're dead. Everybody you've ever known, loved or talked to is dead. I just saved your life! Yes, but you just ended yours. Those two men you just shot are Feds. I need bolt cutters. Do you have bolt cutters? And something flammable. I need your help. Alright, douse them. Hey, these guys, they shoot first and ask questions later. In 10 minutes, we're gonna look just like that. Give it here. Okay. Okay. C- Z- C- H- O- S- L-O- V- A-K-I-A. Bodies? Burning. Well, I guess that ends that. For your sake, I hope that's true. I'm going to make a call now. Make him wait. It's not my life we're playing with. He's asleep. You wanna be the one that wakes him up? And by the way... Johnny!... you still answer to me as well. Taking in a flight this evening, sir? Why not? Yes, sir. I need to get out up there. It's New Year's Eve. Some of us have people we wanted to see at midnight. We could, uh, we could give you a lift. Maybe in another life. Sir. Let's go, Johnny. It's not too deep. I'm gonna need you to take this thing out. If I do this... I'll do everything in my power to wash your hands. Okay now, clear that table. Clear that table! Oh! Lay down. Hey, hey wait, wait, wait. Once you get it out, it's easy, it's just like sewing a patch on a pair of pants. Yeah, right. Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey, oh, hey! Whoa, what is that? What is this? Barrington's. How old is this? I think 15 years. Yeah, 15 years. January 15, 1991. Last time the Skins won the Superbowl. Hey, you better take a swig to ease your nerves. I haven't steadied my nerves since 1991. What color? Gold. I just realized, I never got your name. Sometimes they call me Mac. What's yours? Nice to meet you. There. Yeah. Happy New Year. I love you. I love you. Keep me close in your heart. You are leaving. Listen to me. The worst part of my day is right now. When I have to leave you. Then don't! When will you come back? After the holidays. Me vas a dejar por las navidades, hijo de puta! Excuse me. Vete. Vete! Djame! Leave me! Whoa, whoa! I will. I didn't ask you anything. I haven't asked you anything yet. Sorry. Can I be your husband? Huh? And I'll be your wife. That's good. "Don't you want to know, who was on the other end of the phone?" "Carpe diem. " "Carpe diem. " Who is the greatest quarterback of all time? Sonny Jurgensen. And why was he the greatest quarterback of all time? Because he could make something out of nothing. And who was the moron coach who didn't want him to play? George Allen. And who was the coach that saved the Redskins? Joe Glbbs. And when you grow up, what are you gonna do? Announce the games with Sonny, Sam and Frank on the radio. And why do we know all of this? Because we love each other. # Hall to the Redskins Hall Vic-tor-y # # Braves on the Warpath Fight for old D. C. ## That's for both of us. Happy New Year. Let me guess. You're about to tell me that my... problem... has taken a turn for the worse. You found this, in a wall at the Mayflower. They think he's still alive. How about you? I'm not paid to think, sir. Why would they think that? He's an extraordinarily dangerous, and confused man with an ax to grind. You said it yourself, those are the hardest to put down. Carpe diem. Excuse me? Seize the day. I know what it means, sir, I just... After Vietnam, the City developed this program for lost veterans. Putting them to work, rebuilding the rail yards around Union station. And on every rail spike, they inscribed the words "Carpe diem. " Seize the day. Honor is just... gone. I can't remember anything anymore, anyway, someone once said, "He who has 100 victories in 100 battles, is not the most skillful, "but rather he who subdues the other's military without battle is the most skillful. " Sun Tzu. People look at these men or soldiers, and they think to themselves, They must love to flight. But they've got it, they've got it slightly twisted. You see, the good ones love to win. But they respect the dangers of the fight. But nine times out of ten, a fight, a war, a battle, is won without the first punch being thrown, the first shot being fired, the palace captured, and that, that is when you have honor! When you can capture a man's mind! Then his heart, his fists, they're sure to follow. Didn't you have another life to be lived this evening? How did you do it, sir? Balance the two, live both lives? What's the question? What is the same question, that you ask yourself every day? What price do I pay to make America a safer place today? A "safer place?" See, I think it's more like, "What price did I pay today to defend the tenets of democracy?" You, of all people, should know the difference. Is his... cash missing? I know I shouldn't ask this, but, um, where did you hide it? Well, did he pick it up before or after we got the tag? Not sure. Do you know why we started using those cash boxes? Leverage. No, no. Balance. So you wouldn't forget who you were. And for the lucky ones, so you could forget what you've become. You do whatever you need to do there, sport. It's not up to me anymore. Looks like he came back from the dead. I would say you've got 24 hours, sir. But I guess that's irrelevant now. (man in cap] [indistinct] [scattered applause] How long have I been out? How long have I been out! It's 11 o'clock. About 23 hours. You did a good job. How do you take your coffee? Not at all, thank you very much. What'd I miss? Nothing, really. They caught the Ace of Spades. What? They caught the Ace of Spades. When? About a week ago. It doesn't say who caught him. I know you're not a criminal, I don't know what's going on, and I don't wanna know. I just wanna know how I get out. I want this over. You don't want to know how these guys are, Mac. I don't know your name, and I'm not gonna ask. But please, tell me. Workin' on it, Mac. Do you know where he is? You can handle yourself, right? I do okay. But can you fight with that wound? How much time do we have? About a day before they find us. Follow me. Where you goin', Mac? This is the smallest big city in the world. Kill the lights. You drive a hearse? Get in! He drives a hearse. Where we goin'? Where we going? Have you ever been to the Underground before? Yeah, once or twice. After my acc... I am Sophia. My doctor used to talk to me a lot about vision. He said some people think that vision is that which is there. But to him, vision is seeing that which could be. When we get inside, you stay close to me. Don't speak. When the bluesman comes to the table, I'll set you up. After that, it's up to you. I don't need a weapon. That's good. 'Cause it's not for you. When the bluesman is done, I need to talk to him. When the old man finishes his set, he's gonna come over and sit down. Now you follow my lead. In the car you said you were in an accident, what happened? '91. The Skins had beat the Bulls in the Superbowl. I was going to a friend's house to pick up my daughter. I'd had too much to drink. But in my mind, it wasn't enough. So I stopped, picked up a couple of bottles of Barrington's vodka. At that store where we met. I had finished about a half of one, on the way to Katie's. I was so drunk I didn't even go to the door. For some reason, I made her sit in the back. Only the devil can answer that for me now. The last thing I remember, is waking up two days later in the hospital, handcuffed to a bed with a ruptured spleen and a dead daughter. Yeah. I've been in an accident. Not yet. Tell me about the police. Long time. Mac. Too long. Meat Truck come to the stage, telling me you in here claiming you got a fighter. Something like that. This him? Let me get a look at you. I never forget a face. I know you, yes? I want for you to get him in the cellar. See if he really wants it. What are you saying? You want him to watch? Something like that. There's only one way into that room. Give me a fight. I'll do it for free. It doesn't really matter who, just give me one tonight. How much you weigh... cowboy? A buck 85, give or take. Sorry, champ, no middleweights are fightin' tonight. Only the big boys are gonna bang. The bigger, the better. We got a deal? See that guy over there? That's Meat Truck. He's new. But he'll come get you in about an hour or so for your fight. One last thing. How shall I introduce you? Go into that cellar and tell the children to close their eyes. Tell the women to shut their legs, and the men to put up their fists 'cause there's a war machine comin'. Bet it's alright, man. Maybe not. But the three wise men don't like to be made wrong. Ready? One, two, three! What the hell is this? I don't know. Nor do I want to. Hey, what is that? You don't wanna know, kid. Let's go. Capturing the Ace isn't our objective, is it? Hey!! Capturing the Ace isn't our primary objective, is it? Is it!!?? No. What the fuck is going on? Told you I didn't like this mission. You were always right. When I'm gone, finish it. They're ready for yah. This is anything goes. You know that, dontcha? I bet that hurt. And in this corner, weighing in at 185 pounds, the War Machine! Yeah, you're right. It was you, wasn't it? The voice on the other end of the phone. I have no idea what you're talkin' about. It's not my blood you want on your hands. But you had to be sure, didn't you? Loyal to the end, that's my David. I'm not him anymore. You took that away from me. Nothing you weren't willing to give. I wasn't willing to give up Sophia. Look, you should know, David, that tonight, I traded... my life for yours. So that you could continue to live, and do what needs to be done. Right the wrong. Maybe in another life. Oh, God! I could be bound in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, if it had not bad dreams. But you, you never struck me as the nutshell type, David. In a few moments, I'm gonna walk out that door, A gray Sedan, that's been circling the block for the last four hours will just happen to be passing by the club. And as luck would have it, a young Hispanic male, will fire two shots, both in my direction. And I will die a coward's death. Alone, on a cold and empty street, so that you can become what you were born to be. And already are. A hero, David! A hero. When you saved my life, you asked for no explanation. Given what you will soon or already have read, I feel I owe you that much. Ten days ago, Who is this? Why were we asked to bring this to you? I assume you're not Mitchell. He's dead. So many people think this war is about countries, about land. Your friends probably believe they died for liberty, for truth, for justice. And in a way, they would be right, wouldn't they? By the look on your face, and what you just heard, you might be thinking they died for money, for greed. And in a way, you may be correct. Why is it we become those we fight so hard to exterminate? My advice? Keep running. And pray the sins of these old men never catch up with you. When I was a boy, a very powerful American and his son came to visit my country. When I was running into the house, I heard the American ask my father a strange question, that I now ask of you. Without villains, can there be heroes? You must ask yourself, why your country birthed a villain, in a land of sand and stone. Why they wouldn't need so badly to have the power that only a hero can possess. And you'll, you'll understand the Tao, the truth, or as you people in the West call it, the Way of War. That is my truth. That is my way. Ten days ago my name was David Wolfe. I was a son to father, a soldier to country, a lover to woman. I lived two lives, I carried two names. Ten days later, I have a single mission, a single hunt, a single life, a single name. I am the Wolf. What have I done? Were you able to see the paper this morning, sir? It's horrible. It's tragic. We will honor him with a moment of silence, before I address the nation on that other matter. By the way, how do we stand on that? I have it contained. Good. Oh, I want to thank you for the present you left on my desk this morning with the paper. You should know I plan on incorporating its message into my address. But I... Ah, don't be silly. It's an important concept, in the wake of a grave tragedy. Carpe diem. Seize the day. Must always look forward in times like these. Never backwards. I didn't put that on your desk, sir. Then who did?
