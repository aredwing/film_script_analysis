I've come to you for selfish reasons. In any case' all who come here' come for their selfish reasons. But you know that. You are the Almighty. The last time I offered you a coconut' I got an interview letter. I've got it here. But this time' in order to get the job.... I've made offerings for you using clarified-butter. Taste it' and then decide whether a cook like me... ... should bag the chefs job in a five star hotel or not. I've even brought a coconut. Why isn't this coconut breaking? This never happened before. I hope nothing untoward is going to happen today. Run him down! Stop! The bastard is dead! Call the ambulance. Are you thinking of what I'm thinking? Whether I've fired 6 shots or 5. Honestly even I don't know. Because if I've fired 6 bullets' it's your good fortune. But if I've fired 5 shots... It's my fortune. There's no telling what can happen when in this city. So take your trousers and run home. I'll pay you next time. It's good that I lock the door. Nobody here. But I had switched off the lamp. Anybody there? Don't come out! I have... what's this thing in my hand...! Something resembling a knife! When did you come? How and from where did you come? I came now. In a train from Jalandar! - Good you came. - Live long son. I knew you were to come. My right eye has been twitching since 3 days. Want a slap? When a man's right eye twitches a problem is coming his way! - You called me a problem! - I don't mean that... Give this to me. It's very heavy. Hug me! - Please! - Son! Gently. - This club that you're carrying.. - First eat this! I hope you're not going to start Dad's arena once again. I wish I could. Everything in this country is very good son. But for one thing. Women can't become wrestlers here. It's for you. - What's wrong? - Nothing' I'm doing pushups. That's good. Listen to this. Your Dad paid me a visit in a dream. - Again! - As well as your grandpa. - And his brother too! - And his brother too! - They always come! - What moustaches! Stiff turban and red piped outfit! - I'd die for it! - I'd die for it! - It was an army of wrestlers. - Army of wrestlers! - Know what he said? - No. - Said to me' woman... Have some shame! Go and drown in a pool ofbuffaloes! You are the wife of such a great wrestler! - And an even greater wrestler's daughter-in-law! - Daughter-in-law! Can't you make your son do 4 push ups? He asked me to give this club to you. - Ifhe doesn't bring pride to the name of my arena... - To my arena. - I'll never forgive him! - I'll never forgive him! This is just what he said! You dreamt about this 650000 times! And you've told me about it approximately 3 50000 times! The next time Dad appears in your dream' frankly tell him.. I don't want to become a wrestler. I'll be the topmost chef in India! Eat yourself and build a body. Like your Dad had! - What a diet he had! - I know. One seer of almonds. A bucket of milk' 5 seers chick peas' 200 loaves of corn flour. And one jug ofbutter. Didn't even know how to eat! You've told me so many times that I can repeat it blindly! I won't become a wrestler! I just won't! Just think son' someday if you're in trouble how will you defend yourself? For that one needs 8 grams of brain not a seer of almonds! Now rub this soap on my back and let me bathe in peace. Still a baby! I won't rub it! I have an interview in the morning so fix the alarm for 6 o'clock. I don't need any alarm! I get up by the crowing of the cock! Come on! Aren't you ashamed to break into my house? We are looking for a prisoner who has escaped from jail. My body drags you here. You haven't changed one bit! You forget that this body also houses a heart. You've started talking a lot. I'm not the same person who will put up with all your atrocities! What else can you do but tolerate? Tell me what I can do. Shall I tell you? The man who were looking for... What about him madam? Did you find him? Not yet but we'll find him soon. Keep your doors and windows shut. You can never deceive me. Because you love me too much! Isn't it? Tell me. Say that you love me very much. Why are you silent? Say it. Who is this Manu? It's vital for us to find out. He's the man who was sentenced for 100 years. For hold-ups and robberies. A first class scoundrel who changes disguises at the drop of a hat! I want you to recognise him well. These are a few ofhis disguises. Sometimes he becomes Father D'costa. Sometimes he's hotel manager Sharad Mehta. And sometimes businessman Raman. These were some ofhis disguises that are in police records. You will have to be very alert. Because only Manu knows what his next disguise will be! Who is it? You've ruined me! I had to reach at 8 for the interview! It's already 7 o'clock. What will I do? Mother ruined me soon as she came! Thank God at least got a cab! I'll reach the interview in time! - This is my cab! - This is my cab! I sat in this cab first. So it is my taxi. I hailed it first so it is mine! - This cab is mine. - Mine! - Mine! - Mine! Quiet! This cab is neither yours not hers. It belongs to me! Get off!. - It's vital I reach for an interview.- Listen driver... Quiet! Where do you have to go? Both have to go to the same place. So what's the problem? Let's go together. My name is Bablu Chowdhary. - Who asked you? - I didn't tell you. I'm preparing for my interview. - By the way I'm Harpal Singh. - Who asked you? Look in front and drive. Don't turn behind. If you must fight' go outside the cab. It's very important for me to do a rehearsal. Please. I'm from Punjab and I've completed my graduation. And I'm 25 years old. Okay' 26 years. And I have a diploma from Sarla Cooking Classes. I can cook any kind of meals and I cook very well. And grilled' mashed aubergines are my speciality! If I get this job' I'll work really hard' put my heart in it. I won't take any leave' not even on Sundays! Please give me the job! You don't look like a chef. Even Bebe says that. According to her' I should have been a hero or a model. That's not what I meant. I understood what you meant. Actually you want to make friends. But doesn't matter. Since we are discussing it' I'll tell you... I have two dreams. No make that three. My first dream is... That I become the greatest chef in the world! The second it that my Bebe' mother.. I want to make her very' very happy! And my third dream is... - I won't tell! - Please do. Even I have 3 dreams. Who asked you? Just drive quietly. - Here you are. - We've reached! - How much? - Rupees 1009.75 paise. - How much? - 1009.75. - Divided by 3. Don't disturb. No' it's his car so exclude him. 10000 divide by 2 is 500. Half of 9 is 4.500 Now 75 paise. She's a girl so she pays 35 paise and I'll pay 400. So I'll pay the fare. Nothing. Money to... My name is Bablu Choudhary. Where's the bathroom? Are you Sonia Kapoor? You are so silly! First you paid the fare. Then you left. I went mad trying to locate you. First take your money. I've kept them aside - 54.500. - Hold this please. - What is this? Bribe! This is not a bribe. It's her share of the fare. My mother says men must never take money from girls. One moment. He's the one I was telling you about. Please go if you've finished. I've having an interview! He's the General Manager. - And I am... - I don't want to hear anything. - You may take all the fare from me - You are not listening to me! She's the Banquet Manager of this hotel. I don't need to ask you anything. Because you told me everything in... You've already told me everything. - But the question is... - I'm being interviewed! But a practical test remains. Go into the kitchen and prepare an Oriental dish. What kind of Oriental dish would you prefer? This is Sonia's office not a drama theater. Do you actually know how to cook or just memorised these names? To create an impression. The International Academy of Cuisine gave me a gold medal It's as easy as pie for me to do this. A Japanese delegation is coming here very soon. So quickly make a Japanese dish. Yes. And as per our selection rules' you have only 200 minutes. - Is it too short a time? - No' too much. I can make this dish in 100 minutes! You're still here? I was waiting for you. I thought...ike we gave each other a lift in the morning.. It would be great if the same thing happened again. - Is that all? - No. Actually I wanted to say one thing more. I thought if I travel with you I'll get a chance to thank you. Because I got the job thanks to you. No' you got the job because of your work. But if you want to thank me' let's not delay. Who is it? Don't you recognise my voice? Kiddo' it's your Pop. - Does the phone bite? - You talk. It's Manu. How are you? Congratulations. Left prison hours ago and you call me now? You're smart. As if you came to see me in prison! You've forgotten your old friend. What are you saying? Can one forget friends? You are right. In a way it was better you didn't come. Otherwise the police would have doubts That you guys were with me in the bank loot.. Stop the racket! I didn't spill the beans for the sake of our friendship. Because I am honest even in this dishonest profession. Heard you guys have started decent business with the loot. You've become very respectable! One has to change with time. When will you come to meet me? I am just coming. Keep my share ready. I've got an idea. Let's tell the police and send him to jail. I feel like shooting both of you! Last time' on your suggestion I only sent Manu to prison. Should have sent him to Hell! Who will pay him? Us? I know him for years. He's such a scoundrel. Nobody knows how' when' in what disguise he'll come! And his eyes will only be on us. So Tony will do this job. Call him up and ask him to bring all his sharp shooters to our club. In this war between me and him' one of us has to die. I have no line of death in my hand! So he will come alive. But only his dead body will go back. Gapa here. Quickly come to the club. Have to finish Manu today. He shouldn't escape our clutches. Bring your best men. Gently. Carefully. I haven't come here to fight. I've only come for my money. But it's surprising...I mean' despite my disguise' beard... and all' you've recognised me! You go up. Are you all right? Do I look all right? Go away from here! No bullets! He's picked it up. You spared me. But I won't spare you. Why do you want to see your lover die in front of you? Go away. I had asked you to go away. Why didn't you leave? Go away now. All the arrangements must be in time. I was just thinking of you. The Japanese delegation that was to come next week is coming tomorrow! Tomorrow is very important for us. There will be 600 people for lunch. And if they like the food' we'll get their business for 5 years! Don't you worry. They will like our food. It's a matter of my prestige. Your prestige is my prestige. Watch me tomorrow. Select the menu but do show it to me. One moment please. You haven't eaten a thing since morning. So I've baked you a cake. It is sweet. Have a bite. My hands... You're a good cook. I have some work. See you later. Keep the cake. We'll eat it together. I'll set him straight! What's wrong? Why are you so morose? - What's wrong with my baby? - Tired. I'm feeling sleepy. I knew it! I knew this would happen! Neither do you exercise nor eat almonds or drink milk or butter! - What else will happen! - That's not true! I have to cook for 600 Japanese. I was preparing for that. Don't worry about food at all! I can cook for 60000 people in one day! - I'll come with you. - No mother! No you mustn't come. You can't cook Japanese food! Why not? Don't they have mothers? If they eat food cooked by me' they will lick their fingers off!. - Hug me! - Oh my son! Patel and Ashok would have prepared all the spices... Where has everybody gone? I don't understand either. How could all your assistants go on leave at the same time? I hope you didn't have a fight with anyone. No sir' I'm not the kind who picks up quarrels. But don't you worry sir. The food that will be cooked in this hotel today will be memorable! Because it's a question of Soniaji's prestige. That is fine but you have very little time in hand. This has to be fried. This has to be dry. And this... My dear son! What a huge place! - From where' when and how did you come? - First you answer me! Does anybody help you here? - They do but they've gone today. - Where? - On leave! That is why I wondered why my heart is sinking! But no problem. Now that I'm here. I'll do everything. - Let me do it. - Don't touch anything. - It's a job of a minute for me. - No! Please! You don't know this son. Listen' I'll do it. Come out. Don't waste my time. I have lots of work... I said no once! I'll hug you. Now go home. My spatula. Can't be sure about her! Gets in anywhere! Is everything ready? Then come out and see the arrangements and decorations. Looks good! You're looking gorgeous. Son! Where has he gone? The food is ready! Let me check. He doesn't know a thing Absolutely bland! He forgot to add salt! Doesn't listen to me! This should have been tempered! No salt or chili or spices! Who will eat such bland food! Nobody will eat this! Now I will have to do something! Is everything all right? Do you think the arrangements are fine? Very good. Just like you. Should I tell Lamba to bring the delegation down for lunch? Don't worry. The food is ready. You made all the food yourself? What was that? I'd left you out. - And what are you doing? - Set right your mistake. - What? - I tempered this. Added garlic to that. This things are not tempered! This is not Punjabi food. Whether food is Punjabi or Japanese' it should taste good! Taste it and see. Forget it! I have lost my job! - No' you won't lose it. - Go out mother. - Go out mother! - Listen to me... What are you doing? I'll fall in the water! Hurry up. I have to say something very important to you. - Not now. The Japanese are on.. - It's about them. - What is it? - This food that I've sent.. - It's not Japanese. - But you made Japanese food. - It has become Punjabi! - How can Japanese be Punjabi? - But my mother is Punjabi! - How is she related to Japanese food? She is not related to Japan but Punjab! - Is she a Japanese? - She hails from Punjab! Japanese mother! Punjabi food! No. I'll explain to you. The Japanese food I sent... -... is full of Punjabi spices! - What? Welcome. You ruined me! Destroyed me! - But what have I done? - Keep quiet! Whenever you come from the village' you create some problem! - Who? Me? - Then' who else? Why don't you understand? I'm not a kid any more! However much a child grows' he remains a kid for his mother! All right if you don't need me' I am going home! Don't ever ask me to hug you again! Didn't you hear? They are asking for your chef. Go and call him. - What are you doing? - Taking my life! Later. First come in and tell everyone it's your mistake not mine! The Japanese will thrash me if I go inside! - And you should be! - Forgive me please. - Don't take me in! - You have to be punished. Listen to me. I'll work as your cook all my life with no leave! He is saying that they all liked your food very much! What are you doing up there? Climb down! Coming in a minute. Standing in the middle! Yes speak up. Sir I've seen Manu going with a girl to Seaside Restaurant. - Are you sure? - Absolutely sir! - I want to.. - I know you want to tell me something Should I tell you? - I saw a dream. - Is it? I have married a beautiful girl. Just like you. And the day we get married' she is dressed in bridal finery. And is sitting on my bed. And softly I walk towards her. Then? Then I lift her veil. - Next? - Then I... With my hands... I feed her a potato dumpling in a bun! Come here. Why didn't you meet me earlier? - Stupid! - Feeling shy! You told me about the dream. And the girl in the dream. Why didn't you tell me her name? - Some other time. - Why? The girl's name is... That's a boy's name. We are... Who are they? I'll check. What are you guys doing here? Has some minister come? No' a gangster has come. - Who? - Manu. - You. - Me??? What are you doing? Why are you pushing me down? Wait! For the last time! Who helped you escape from prison? Now tell me! I've never been to jail. So how can I escape from there? And I'm not Manu! Fooling me! Think you're extra smart! Since when is this girl' Lily in your gang? I'm no Lily! I'm Sonia. - And I'm not Manu. - So you're not Manu' she's not Lily Then maybe I'm not Inspector R.K. Thakur. What are you staring at? Dial this number. Ask for our hotel manager Lamba. I'm the Banquet Manager and he is my chef. Come here! Whose idea was it to work in a hotel? Sir I'm not Manu! You're not Manu' right? You are Bablu. Do you have any proof of that? - My mother! - Call his mother! I'll call up my mother. My mother will come here and see me with Sonia... No sir. I can't call my mother here. - Why? - No. I can't. If she sees me here she will murder me! I mean you may murder me but I won't call her here! Try to understand. If she comes here... Hang me but I won't call her here! You are trapped! Ifhe has a mother' she will come. But there is no mother! If I knew the truth about you' I would have handed you to the police! I told you earlier but you are so innocent that... I know you. This is Sonia' our banquet manager. She's been in our hotel for years. And whether this is Bablu or Manu... I can't give his guarantee. - I can vouch for her though. - Fine you may take her. - Will you beat me? - Not at all. What? My son in jail! Are these policemen craZy? What? They want proof? I'll just bring it over! I'll ruin them all! - Who are you? - Who am I? - I'm Bablu's mother! - What proof do you have? Rascal! What proof do you have that you are your mother's son? You can't go there! He's a criminal! Dangerous! They think I'm somebody else not Bablu He is Bablu! I swear by God! Look at his childhood photographs. When we had gone to the fair. This is last years picture when we went to Vaishnodevi's temple. You looked beautiful then. I brought all the proof!. Give vent to your anger later. First release my son. Live long! May God make you a commissioner! Hug me mother! - Come in. - Called somebody else? No. Whom can I call so early? - Don't whistle! - Who is it? Television mechanic. Come to fix the set. There's nobody in my life but you. But you've become very smart. Don't waste time talking. Come soon my darling. I'm dying to see you. Are you paid for nothing? Does your father lose something if you fix these things earlier? You depraved people have only one problem! Rascals are accustomed to eating for nothing! Everybody does that sir. You argue with me! Do your job and get lost! Is some broad coming? Asking me? How dare you ask me! Rascal! You scum! Recognised me? Your old partner. Now tell me who eats off others' living? You or me? So you sent me to prison and... You're watching television in comfort at my expense! You love to watch television. - No! - Yes you love it. I'll show you some television. But you can't see it from far. Your eye sight is weak. You don't have glasses. Come. - Come on. - No. Ingratiate! Eats chicken with my money! - Now can you see? - No. Go close and see. Forgive me. Our friend and partner got killed because... Your police department let loose a nabbed criminal! Why? Was he related to you? We set him free after inquiries. On seeing his pictures with his mom we realised he was Bablu not Manu! He was Manu! Disguised as Bablu' he fooled this chap! He doesn't know that Manu is a man of many faces! He can dress up like anybody. What about the photographs? You get mothers on hire for 10000 chips! Pictures for 500! Then whether you call him Manu or Bablu' it's the same man! How much did Manu pay you? That's an allegation! I'm an honest police officer! And the commissioner's brother-in-law! Why don't you say something? This is my office. He was your old partner. Please take a seat. Please check your record. We got him imprisoned. Is that why he is after you? We must apprehend him before he attacks either of them. Go if you want to. But you will see I won't eat. Nor will I exercise. I'll find some dirty girl and get married. - Sister. - What is it? Will you marry me? What are you murmuring son? - Don't go! - There's an evil eye on you. Your stars are bad. When I complete this pilgrimage' all will be fine. If you go' I'll be left alone. But I'm going for you! Why don't you understand? I too don't like going far away from my only son! - Then why are you going? - Some rascal has cast a spell on you! I'll go there' pray for you. The Lord will set matters right. I'll come back soon. Don't cry my son! - What is it? - Hug me! The phone is out of order. I said the phone is not working. This is Sonia. - You're still angry with me. - No why should I be? In any case I'm not Bablu. I'm that guy... Don't be mad now. - Now when do we meet? - I don't want to meet you. You will have to meet me! I'm not used to being turned down! Hilltop Restaurant' 4 o'clock. - You will come there. - I will not! I know you will come. You are making a mistake! This is cruel! I'll report to the press! Your photograph will be printed on the first page of each newspaper! Did you see this? From where has he come? My duplicate? Carbon copy? I must take advantage of this. Because my life is in his death! Where are you going? You wait here. I'll check it out. What a bomb! The boss' night is made! My friend! I know you are pulling my leg. What a miracle! You had me scared. This can't be Manu. I locked him up in prison myself!. This is Manu's doing! That scoundrel Manu has killed Dhingra. If Manu killed Dhingra' who is the one in prison? This is not one man but two men who look alike. Wow! What a Xerox machine the Lord has! They both look alike! It's difficult to say which is the original and who is duplicate! Our problems have doubled! - What do we do about Bablu? - This is my office! Make an ID card and give it to Bablu So if we make another mistake' we can know from the ID card. Who is the original and who is the duplicate! Son this is your ID card. Keep it safe. The difference between you and Manu is this ID card. If a policeman catches you' show it to him. And be free in a jiffy. Understood? Mother has come! Hide and seek! Mother hug me! Are you smoking mother? Who am I? No Bablu' you are not dreaming. I am Manudada and you are you. My duplicate! So you are Manudada! Do you know how much I suffered because of you? The police locked me up twice! And Sonia.... She is my girl friend. She too is angry with me. But thanks to this... one moment...identity card. Which the police gave me so this mistake is not repeated. Why are you putting out your tongue repeatedly? Are you teasing me? I know you are uninvited guests in this house. If somebody sees me with you' I will be in great difficulty. So just take your pals and leave. Manu comes ofhis own will and leaves when he desires. - No... - Quiet! Come on. Give me the ID card. - I can't give it to you. - Quietly hand it over. Mother says even an enemy who comes home is a guest. And a guest is not humiliated. Otherwise even I can beat you! Oh! Give me the ID card! Please don't take it from me! Doesn't matter if you've taken it. Leave me. I'm scared ofheights! What is the matter? Now I will live like Bablu. And you will die Manu's death. If you don't die at the hands of the police' I'll kill you! But first let me take revenge from all my enemies! And get my booty back. You can't live for long on my card. Someday the police will find out the truth about you. Because this ID card has the imprint of my thumb! Your thumb impression will be different from mine! You are right. You are not as stupid as you look. Our faces resemble each other. But thumb impressions are different. Let's remove that difference too. How? Isn't it burning? What are you doing? Don't do this! It will hurt! Mother! There's no sign of Manu who escaped from jail. I haven't understood what's happening. I feel Manu and Bablu are one man. He pretended to pick a job with our hotel to escape the police. You are so suspicious! He knows nothing but cooking! How can he kill anybody? Have you ever seen the innocent Bablu's eyes? Those eyes can only love. - Only love! - Why should I look into my cook's eyes? But you seem to have looked deep and close into the cook's eyes! I know what you mean to say. But I have no time for trivial talk. I am going. Where are you going? To Bablu's house. Open the door. Sonia is here. Come out. I know you are inside. Is she the girl you're having an affair with? - Hurry up! - Heard she's quite a dish. Let me taste and see. If you don't open the door now' I will... break the window! You took so long! Your mood maybe rotten but you're wearing good threads! Now don't sulk. I've come to take you. - Where? - Hotel. Where else? The kitchen is waiting for you. Why the hotel? Let's stay here' in my house. I'm getting late. Let's go to the hotel. Just a minute. Let me lock the house. Get down. Come in. I'll show you! Do you know... Today you're looking very macho. You've started again! What are you doing? - Lamba will come... - If any call comes.. So you've come? What do you think of yourself? You come and go as you wish! Why are you staring at me? Rascal' is this your father's... Are you hurt? If you want to work here' behave properly otherwise get lost...! This poor fellow was caught because of the scoundrel Manu! This won't occur again' isn't it? All right. I accept because you're saying it. Make some tea. You're looking beautiful. Anyway... There were two things.. Do you want cold tea or hot? Is tea ever had cold? What have you done? Do you take more sugar? Now I'll speak your language dimwit! What do you think of yourself? - What the hell are you? Son of a cook! - Not on the face! I'll knock you out in one punch! Fall at my feet! What is going on Bablu? Ravi' come down! This is my office not an arena where you can pick fights! I kept telling him not to hit me on my face. But he paid no heed. There's a limit to my patience. Hit me if you wish. If it wasn't for Sonia' I would... - Go now. - Don't go away. What is wrong with you? I'd never seen this form of yours! You were not like this. When will you return? Didn't I always tell you... Eat well' exercise. If your body was strong... You were a body builder like your Dad Would Manu and his men dare break into our house and beat you? Don't worry mother. Don't cry. I can't bear to see you sad. These tears came to your eyes because of Manudada. Now see me use my 8 gram brain against him! Ifhe can become Bablu' can't I become Manudada? I can' can't I? Now I will play his game and teach him such a lesson... ...that he will apologise to you on bent knees! This is my promise! I swear by you. Just don't cry. Long live son. My blessings are with you. Put your hand down! Rascals were sleeping! - Where is Bablu? - Sleeping. Go and find him. Yes. Find him. He's not inside. Ifhe isn't found till evening. Then your corpses will leave this place. Go! Why does he wear a coat in this heat! - Give the line to Sonia. - Who is speaking? I'm Bablu. Fast! Who are you? Bablu has just left That too with Sonia! I am Bablu not he! Don't you remember I give your pastries? If you call again' I'll inform the police. Who's speaking? Which Lily? I was talking to Anita. Who is she? So now there's an Anita in your life! - Where are you calling from? - Behind you! - Behind me? - Stop the jokes! What were you doing here? I...I was just calling you - I missed you. - The police is all around. - That's why I was hidden here. - Then come soon. - What are you doing? - It's so dark. Why are you putting your tongue in my ear? What times have come! Television and films have ruined the country! - Come on. - Repair the car in the garage? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with me? Nothing at all. Nothing happened to me in jail. You guys have bad eye sight. Who is it? - WE made a mistake. - Forgive us. Bablu escaped somehow. We couldn't find him anywhere. - Press my legs! - Give us one chance. Just one more chance. I have little children. - Forgive us. - First let go of my feet! You know Manudada never ever forgives anybody! And if you have made a mistake.. You will be punished for it. Get ready. - Take this. - What is it? - How many bullets in it? - I don't know sir. Then why did you give it to me? Hold it yourself!. Men do make mistakes. You make mistakes' he does. So do I. If Bablu has run away let him! I feel there maybe some good in it. Ifhe has escaped from your hands' let him go! You too may go. Stop! Now that you are going' wish your mother on my behalf. Give your kids these Glucose biscuits. - You are not Manudada. - Don't tell anybody! You are an angel! Go away! You guys also go! Your goodness kills me! I'll eat you alive! Cheat! Liar! Savage! What happened? What are you doing? Where are you going? Manu comes ofhis own sweet will and leaves when he desires! - Death lurks. - Where? - All around us. This is my tale of sorrow. Child God is with you. This is he! I am not who you think I am! And I'm definitely not what you think I am! Don't you dare take my name with your dirty mouth! Who? Me? I am Bablu! Your Bablu! - Liar! - Me' a liar? Manu is a liar not me! He was roaming with you. He resembles me' my duplicate. How much' how much will you lie? Please believe me. No! Don't show me your innocent eyes! These eyes have deceived me earlier too. No! You have to look in my eyes! - No! - Look into my eyes. Can these eyes look at you in that way? What ever you are; Bablu' Manu' Baldy! Leave me alone! So now I'm Baldy! But before I leave I must say.. Neither am I Manu nor Baldy! I am Bablu Choudhary. Age 25 years. Okay I'm 26 years old. And I have 3 dreams. My first dream is to make my Bebe' my mother very happy. My second dream is to become the greatest chef on earth. And my third dream is... To love Sonia a lot! I want to marry her. Please forgive him! No! No! Till I prove I'm not Manudada... I am Bablu. I won't show you my face till then. Why didn't you meet me earlier? Hug? Car! Money! - I have to go. - Where? But I will return. Come back soon. Come out Bablu. Or I will thrash you! Shameless! You're so drunk that you're calling out to yourself!. - Who...? - Who? Your mother! You are so drunk you can't recognise your mother! I'm your mother! You've turned your father's name to dust! Get up! I'll make you sober! I go on a pilgrimage for you! Pray and worship for you! And you drink liquor! Get out! Shameless! Scoundrel! Drinks and comes home to ask me who I am! Now you know! I'm your Bebe! The engine is heated up. Shall we check it? You go in love. I'll look after them Bablu has escaped. But Shalako won't escape my hands! It's your turn. Come over. You've walked into the jaws of death. You testified against me. Now you won't be fit to do anything. Rascal! Go out. No he can't come to the phone. He is naked. Down Manu! - Don't come out of the water. - What will you do? You're not wearing anything pal! The Lord gives in plenty! Don't touch it. That's my money! Then come and take it. - Where's the bag? - You have it. Do you have a bag? Found it. I knew it! I did! You would try to kill me after taking all my money! Are you mad? Why are you inviting death? Quietly hand over my share of the booty! Your share? Are you mad? Have you lost your memory? Remember? Just 1 00 minutes ago' taking advantage of my nudity... You ran away with all my money! - What money? - You tell me! Your Pop will answer! - Why are you laughing? - Hoodwinked! Who hoodwinked us? The biggest fool! Bablu! He took off with our booty. And Shalako and Manudada were left clapping! Just think. If I had stolen your money... Wouldn't I have taken your life too as interest? This hand of yours which doesn't have a death line... Wouldn't I have drawn one? Seems furious! He'll beat me hard! Boss' Bablu has been found! I'm not Bablu. I'm Manu. Stand straight or I'll shoot your head off!. I'll...come from there. Put on the jacket. Everybody clear out! I mean grab him. - So Bablu has come? - Hey shut up! I am not Bablu! You are! Stand still! Brothers' so he says he is Manu and I am Bablu. We'll see. Hold him tight guys! What are you guys doing? Hold him and check his pockets. Throw it here. This is a police identity card. This very clearly says that you are Bablu Chaudhary. Because if I was Bablu' I would have this card. But in whose pocket was this found? - His! - So who is he? And who am I? Who is he? Who am I? Have a look. These fools don't recognise me. But you will know me. I'm your Manu. He's Bablu! Lily' I'm Manu... Gently. Yes' your Manu. You act very well. You trash can! Enough. Now all leave. Take him along and go! It will prove very dear! Now what will be your fate Manu? - Don't come back! - You won't leave alive if you do! Manudada has been humiliated! It will turn out very dear turning me into Bablu' Bablu! Swear by mother' now you're dead meat! Mother. Turned sober? Or still intoxicated? Wearing such funny' dark clothes! And calling me mother instead of Bebe I made a big mistake last night. Won't you forgive your son? A mother forgives her enemy too. But you're my son' my baby! See I bought you a lovely suit. - Quickly wear it and get ready. - Why did you buy such a costly one? If you want me to get what I want... Then you have to come with me. I will come my son but where? To bring treasure. Treasure? Your future daughter-in-law. But she says she won't even meet me unless you're with me. She will definitely meet you. I will come with you! This is Manu. My den is in your hands. My men became yours. Even Lily is with you. But doesn't matter because... Your Bebe is with me. If you don't come to Gate 1 of the Docks right now... I will shred your Bebe to pieces! Hurry up. The meter is running. Did you hear my Bebe's voice? Come fast. Treasure. Please leave my Bebe alone. Stop the car quickly! Follow them. So you are Bablu. - Yes. - What was Manu saying? He was saying... My mother is in his hands. I want to ask you just one question. Why did he have to drag my mother in this fight between us men? Even I am his enemy. But did I ever misbehave with you? Did I take advantage of the fact that you think I am Manudada? Even today if I wish... I can take you along and free my mother! But my mother taught me... Good people respect women. Halt. Get lost. Good God! What a desolate place you've brought me to Bablu? Does your wealth live in these ruins? - She doesn't live. - Then? She is going to come here. Going to come? She's come! Where were you? Do you know we have been looking for you since 2 days? We were so worried. We looked here and there' everywhere. She is so pretty! And she jabbers in English so well! - Mother-in-law. - Do well and prosper. What's the matter? How do you know this is Bablu? His mother is with him. I'll get it confirmed for you. Mother' this is our General Manager. Touch her feet. Live long son. I'll take leave. Far away from your life. Thank you so much brother. - You've helped me so much... - Enough! Brother? Fast! Quick! Plan 1 ' you go right. Plan 2' you go left. Right not left. Any questions? One question. Where will you go? I will go up. - And me? - You'll go left. If you see Bablu anywhere' pounce on him and catch him! - And if we don't see him? - Keep looking for him! Solitude. Where has she gone? Brought the money? Here. Now hang the bag on the pulley. No' first tell me where Bebe is. Your Bebe is talking to her future daughter-in-law. - What? - Look there. Tell me what can you cook. I can't cook anything but I know how to make lists of food items. Put the money on the pulley. Hurry up! - Pull it. - You are very foolish. You have washed your hands off this money. Also your Sonia. And Bebe too! - What do you mean? - The meaning is clear. This gun and you the target. This bullet. And your chest. Now Bablu will die and Manu will enjoy! He will also marry your Sonia. You cheat! I won't let this happen! My mother-in-law gave me these bangles and huge ear rings. Here! Will you be my daughter-in-law? God is great! Scream! The fish is trapped in the bait! You can't escape now! I am your Manudada! There he runs! Go and nab him! He's hanging! Looks like he is trapped! Where is Manu? There he is! We've surrounded you from the bottom. Don't try any stupidity! I'm hanging in mid air. What could be more stupid! Tell the police not to fire! Idiot! He's Bablu not Manu! It's not my job to find out whether he's Manu or Bablu! It's your job. Now say sorry! What are they doing there? Helping the wrong man! Pull! Pull me up. Shall we check his ID card? You'll check the ID card of a man hanging for his life! If you had caught one of the two' wouldn't the confusion be reduced? Come' carefully. - Why were you hanging from there? - Are you all right? You've grown so big yet you have no sense! Where am I caught! Come here! Where are you running off!. - Stupid! Rascal! - Stop it! What are you doing? What are you doing Bebe? Don't you recognise your own son? He's Manu and you're beating me! My son! My love! That is why I wondered why he brought me to this wilderness! You cheat! Not just a cheat... I'm much worse than that! You haven't seen the real me. What do you mean? The meaning is clear. The police whom you have called to arrest me... You will go to them yourself and say that you... .... are Manudada. Otherwise this girl of yours... This new bride... And this old Bebe... I'll riddle them with bullets! Understood! Well done! I had heard that even thieves keep But you turned out to be worse than them! Remember you had said' if you get your money... You would free Sonia and Bebe. Did I say that? Fine. You take them with you. If you want to be spared' throw both these women towards me. How can I leave them? These two are Manudada's tickets to freedom. Don't act smart! Or all these guys will shoot at you! Shoot me if you want. Manu is not afraid ofbullets. Shoot! I will only count to 7 If you don't leave them by then... Then I'll shoot! Take Bebe and go. You can't escape. You have no other option. Your game is up. - One! - Please go. Two! - Three! - Bebe' take Sonia and go! - No. Four! - Five. - Go! Gourd? - Spinach' cabbage' tomatoes! - Six! - Go for my sake mother! - Seven! Don't move! Where is my money? I don't have any money. - You took it. - No! You gave me tomatoes' radish' and carrots not my money! Even bitter gourd. So my plan has been successful! What do you mean!! The meaning is... Come with me' Bebe and Sonia. Move' let fresh air through. Have you heard' the child is with you and you're searching the city? See! Did you see mother' the wonder of my 8 grams ofbrain? Well done my son! Now you're in my hands. Not yet! - Kill him! - Which is my son? Any suggestions Miss English? Whom do we fire at? We must know who is who. I am Bablu. - No' I'm Bablu! - No' I'm Bablu! Stop it! Who will tell? I will tell since I'm the mother. A mother can find her real son. Hold my hand Bablu. The blood ofhis ancestors flow through my son's veins. He is the son of a wrestler. He is not weak. The one who can pull me towards him' with his strength.. I am his mother. He's my son. Son' take the Lord's name! And pull your mother! My arm! You are blind! This is Manudada! My true son is him. I hope you're not hurt. He couldn't bear his mother's pain. When I cried in pain' my child let go of my arm. This is too much! If anyone steps forward' I'll roast the old hag's brains! Throw down your guns! - Down! - No son! - Let my mother go! - Don't move ahead! - I'm your enemy not she. Don't use women as shields. Let her go! - Fight with me! - No! My son! My son! Forgive me. Working with you' I too had become like you. I met Bablu and found what goodness is The world needs neither Manu nor Lily. It needs people like them
