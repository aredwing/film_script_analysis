There's such amazing snowfall here. And the room cozy and warm with central heating. Remember I told you about Khanum? She's a very helpful girl. Tonight Lailu's going for a study sleep over at her house. Hi. What can I get you? Can I have a house white please? Sure. A coke. What? You think this is McDonalds? Have a drink! I've never had one... Why don't you look at our cocktail list? Our Pina Coladas are really popular. We have Sex on the Beach, Mojitos, Manhattans... Anything you like. Can I have a... Margarita? With a straw. Great choice. Okay, coming right up! Have you ever dated? Why would anyone date me? Why do you put yourself down all the time? Let me do it for you! Because that has been my experience. For the last time... You are very beautiful. Okay! One white wine and a Margarita, with a straw, for you. Thank you. You 're very welcome. Thank you. Can I get you some wine? No. I have a headache. You need one exotic head massage. And by mistake if I strangle you, forgive my blindness! Lailu! Thats enough time in the bath! Mom! There's no end to the hot water here! Will you come out? Why? Where's your gold chain? It must have fallen off. It had such a strong clasp. How can it just fall off? It's not in the bathroom either. The caregiver must have taken it! We trust these people and they take advantage. I'm going to phone her right now. Maybe that's why she didn't come to work today. Mom... No Lailu. It can only be her. I pawned it! What? I bought an IPad. It's really cool. It even has a voice activator. It was your grandmother's chain! What's happened to you Lailu? But I wanted it for my studies... Studies? Surfing porn sites is studying?! You should be ashamed of yourself. How dare you? This is my privacy. Privacy? You want privacy from me?! I'll slap you if you talk to me like that. Move in with me. And what should I tell my parents? Even in their wildest dreams they wouldn't guess that we're lovers! I will miss you Mom. Bye. - Bye. Oh fuck! Keep the place. The University pays for it anyway. Always have a place of your own, so no motherfucker can put you on the street. Give me the address. I'll go there tomorrow morning. Oh ifs okay. Khanum can take care of me. That's a big no no. People don't like to be carers and lovers at the same time. Besides... That would put me out of work. You can stay here while I'm gone... if you like. After all this renovation you better not break up with me for at least 2 years! Do you want lip gloss? Yes. Lailu. Come home in the summer break. Did you just win the lottery? I still haven't repaid the debt of your outgoing flight... ...so might as well add the cost of another flight to it! Happy Holi Papa. Hello Mom. How are you Khanum? I'm good. Thanks. Why don't you also come to India with Laila? I really want to come Mom. But Laila never invites me! What happened? Nothing. I'll definitely come now! Just pray to Allah that I get my visa. You must come. Yes. Where's Monu? In the bathroom. As always! Here you go. Your receipt's in the bag. Thank you. You're welcome. Don't move anything around. When did you figure out... that.. You know.. ...you're gay? Your body is perfect. You could be a model. Have you ever seen a model who's blind? I've known I'm gay since I was fourteen. Wow. I wish I could be that certain. You know I was okay with the realisation. But the main problem was parents and relatives. You have to lie all the time. And then spend hours feeling guilty about lying. Just wasn't my thing. So I told them. Then? What happened? My mother kissed me... ...and hugged me! No way! Of course not. There was a full scale drama! First there were slaps... ...then emotional blackmail... ...counseling... ...howling...weeping. Then? My mother took me to a doctor... As if I had some disease that could be cured. Oh god. When all her efforts failed she finally ...stopped talking to me. Is she still angry with you? Last week after she'd had a fight with my Dad... ...she phoned me and said... Thank God you will never ever have to deal with men! My parents would have a heart attack! For me I just like to be who I am all the time. This is scary for me. It's wonderful... ...but so scary. It's tipping down with rain! You can do some work too you know! No. Now that I know you can type so well... and were conning me all this while...! It's because I... ...I thought you were cute! So you don't think I'm cute any more? Now I have a... ...I'm with someone. 30? Can I use your bathroom? Yeah, ifs just on the left. Oh. I should help you. Okay. Okay. I'm done. Can I straighten your leg? Yeah. Just relax okay? I'm feeling shit scared. Scared? Don't worry. Yeah. I have bad news for you. What? The Indian government has denied my visa. I've got the visa and the ticket! Here Comes the Bride..... Maharashtrian eggplant! Again? So what? Nothing. No. Go ahead. Just say it! What should I say? It might even be possible to see a lion eating grass... But to see a Punjabi eating this stuff everyday...! Can't show my face in the community! So you should have married that Punjabi girl... Can't remember her name. Harneet. Yes. Harneet! She could make you your roti and butter chicken! Khanum my child. Tell me - what's wrong with this? It's really yummy. Heard? Did you hear? Yes. I heard. You should have made something else. Are you sure? Yes. She is. That's great. Evolved choice. How will you have kids? Get with the century, dude! If Aunty finds out - there'll not just be bomb blasts but serial blasts! Mom's not like that at all! I've known Aunty for 540 years! Don't under estimate her. Mom is a 'rockstar' She is way ahead of my own ammi. And I came out to her. Mom. I'm Bi. Am I any less of a maid (Bai)? What?! No matter how educated Indian men are, at some level women are just maids! Look at your own father. Come what may - he just wants my cooking. They should be lined up and made to wash clothes! Really Lailu. I'm not joking. I know! Mom! I love you, Mom. Love you too. Mom... You look like a heroine with your short hair. You know that thing I was saying about being Bi... Now you're well and truly a maid. Because of me. Give. I meant... Bisexual. Bi...what? What does it mean? I love Khanum, Mom. Yes. We all love her. She's so nice. Khanum's my girlfriend! Yuck. Not done Mom. You're being a hypocrite. Who's put this in your head? There's nothing hypocritical here. Of course there is! Don't argue Laila. This isn't normal. That's what the world said about me too. What's your problem now? Ask! You ask. No. You. Monu's insisting on being taken to the cricket match! If we don't buy the tickets today there'll be none left. Ask your mother. What can I say! Mom. Please! I've even finished studying. This is Khanum's first trip to India... How can we let her go without watching a cricket match! Mom! Papa. Now you handle it! What can I do! Monu. Play gently. Play- Go Khanum! -Play. Where's Mom? She's inside. The doctor said we can see her soon. Why has she been admitted? Your mother has colon cancer. Second stage. Relapse. Your mother's a fighter. She will definitely beat it. One of you has to wait outside. Okay. Sorry. Nothing will happen. Go back to America. How's Khanum? Okay? -Yeah. I'm sorry Khanum. You're not coming back to New York right? I am. Definitely. One day...in New York At Jared's house... While we were working... I had sex with him. What do you mean? When we were together? Once. How could you? I wasn't thinking. I was confused... I know what I did was wrong. So by fucking you, Jared gave you a certificate of normalcy? No. It happened in the moment. -How convenient . Jared could see me. That's why. You used me! To take care of you... ...Fill your loneliness. So I was a stopgap till you could find a boyfriend right? No Khanum. That's not fair. After doing all this you have the fucking balls to call me unfair? You should have told me then and finished it off. Why carry on a Charade all this while? I didn't want to lose you. Now what? You think I won't leave because of Mom. I don't want secrets anymore. Laila... What? Lailu. My feet are feeling cold. Nurse. Can we get some woollen socks please? The blanket should suffice. Nurse. Socks! Now! One minute, Mom. No. Just let it be for a little longer. Please. Good girl, Mom. I'm sorry. She is gone. Papa. Can you play this for Mom? Laila, my child, let the rituals be over first. Monu, get the CD. Panditji, one moment please. Was it really necessary to tell me? Yes. Khanum, Laila, hurry up! Its getting late to go to the airport. Your straight hair is great. Tony, please try something different today. Of course! Hi. -Hi. Hey listen. We're going for a movie. Do you want to come? Some other time. Why? I have a date. Helloooo! With who? Come Bye. Ma'am. Your Margarita. Pour it into this please. Thank you.
