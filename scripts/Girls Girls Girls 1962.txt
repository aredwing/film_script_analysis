Dont let it get away. - Maybe youd better give me a hand. - Right. Watch it! OK, Mr Morgan, shes all yours. Watch yourself! Thanks. Heart attacks are so common. ld hate to bury him at sea. - Arthur! You reel him in. - Shut up and give me another pill. Open your mouth... There you go, sport. OK, Chen. Lets haul it in. OK, Chen. Now. Put a canvas over it, Chen. - Where is it? - lts in the bow, Mr Morgan. - l like the way you did that. - Thanks. Ahoy, Kingfisher! Ahoy, West Wind! - Well race you! - Why? You know l cant beat you. - A sailboat take a fisher? - l let them win. - l can see why. - Theyre girls! See you at the dock, Ross! - Sure is a beauty. - Which one? The boat! Sharp, aint she? - Real yare, Jack. - Ross. Why dont you relax and come get some sun with me? - Why not check on your husband? - No! Take a look, Chen. - Mr Morgan, hes sleeping. - Thats him! - Dont you feel sorry for me? - ln a way, yeah. -You must get a lot of this. - Quite a bit. Youd think the fish smell would keep them away. - You wanna keep them away? - No! l like girls. - Not as much as the boat. - l live on her. ld like to own her. - Whats stopping you? - Money. That shouldnt be a problem. - You must be kidding. - No, l wouldnt do that. l dont give to organised charity. But theres a big charge in doing it this way. - lndividual cases. - Mrs Morgan... l dont accept charity. l have to earn what l get. You would, honey. You would. - Ross. - Hi. When will you teach your daughters to stow a sail? Mr Morgan liked the boat. Hell charter again. Can l talk to you, please? Whats the matter, Papa Stavros? - Nothing. - Somethings bugging you. - The doctor says a bug is bugging me. - lm sorry... Today, he tells us we must move to a dry climate, like Arizona. - Arizona? - Arizona. Papa learn English so they want him to move. - What they speak there? - Mama, this is not a joke. - Dont worry, Ross. We wont move. - But if youre sick... Sick? A woman isnt as young as she was, so they look for a reason. - Then its not serious? - Of course it is. Dont listen. lf he says he must sell the boats, also dont listen. Come to our wedding anniversary on Wednesday night and forget about all this. - All right, Mama, thank you. - Chen. You come, too. Thank you, Mama. Come on, Papa. You have made enough trouble already. Papa... The West Wind, too? Yes. Hey, Sam. - Hi, Ross. - How are you? Shell be off soon. Wait at the bar. - Long time no see. - Not so long. To what disaster do l owe this visit? - You know? - No. Only, l know when old head on the shoulder Robin comes on. l come when theres nothing wrong. You come when you want to sing a little or cry on my shoulder. - Which is it tonight? - l dont feel much like singing. Stavros is moving to Arizona, selling the fishing boats and the West Wind. Good. lts the only way to get it out of your system. lts not that easy. Losing a home and a job all in one day. lt might be worth it... if you lose the dream, too. Look, my father and l built the boat together. l wanted to own it. Thats not a dream. Your father is gone and so is that part of your life. The worst thing for you was Papa letting you live on that boat. - l can count on that speech. - Count on me. - Here we go again! - Should l pretend l dont care? Dont make things tougher than they are! Ready for your number, Robin? Let Sir Galahad do it, OK? - What are you doing to her, Ross? - Nothing. He just came in to tell me his troubles and l told him mine. - lts my fault. - lts nobodys fault... Jeez! Would somebody sing? - Sure, Mac, sure. - Thanks, pal. Hey, you sing, Ross. Come on, favour to me. Great! Any time you wanna make it permanent, let me know. Thanks, Sam. lm still a fisherman. - Whats this? - The swinger with the mink look sent it. - You must smell of musk or something. - Excuse me. l dont work here, but thanks anyway. - Whats the matter? Not enough? - Want me to...? - You sing lousy anyway. - Thank you. - l thought you sang very well... - He stinks! The old stinkeroo. - Ross Carpenter. - Laurel Dodge. Yes, sir. The real old-fashioned stinkeroony. - Whos the intellectual? - A bad idea l had. Blind date. - Hes blind, all right. - Wait, pal, get your own date. Had to call the cops, didnt you? Thank you. - Go cry on her shoulder. - Wait a minute. Youre Sir Galahad, all right, to strangers. - lm sorry l caused trouble for you. - Dont give it a second thought. Girls! - What? - You dropped a handkerchief. - Come on! - Got a match? - Cut it out. - l thought you needed help. - l can get this from my enemies. - l never saw him before. - Honey, l gathered that. - Now, you come on! He said he was a friend of my fathers and he wasnt. OK, l believe you. OK. Whos the girl? She said she was an old football buddy of my mothers, but she wasnt. - Where do you live? - Down the road. - Very far? - Not too far. Lets go. lf youre trying to tire me, its working. Whats the name of that church? - The Old Church, everybody knows that. - lve never been here before. Where do you come from? Grand Rapids? No. Cant we go back and go inside? - Corpus Christi? - No. You could rest. Maybe sing with the choir. - Prattville, Oklahoma? - No! lts such a nice night. Wouldnt you like to go to another local landmark? Only the one youre staying at. - lll show you where lm staying. - Good. Shall l call a cab? - l dont think thats necessary. - lf you think lm gonna walk... Well, here we are. - Here? - lts simple and it reeks of history. - Reeks of something. - Goodnight. - Arent you asking me in? - They double the rent for that. - What do you think this place is? - l want to find out. Tomorrow. - What time? - Lunch? - lll pick you up. - Where are we eating? The Mariners. Menu? - Well meet there. - You dont know it. lll find it. Youre sweet, Ross. Then, why am l leaving? Would you like a room or anything? lf you dont mind parrots. - Parrots? - Yes. You see, l have 23 darling creatures who travel with me everywhere. Of course, l always make arrangements far ahead. The Hilton people werent at all understanding this time. As a result, l find myself and these poor creatures left... You have to excuse me now. lts their dinner time. Bye-bye, yall. Bye-bye, now. Bye-bye, now... Parrots? Ross! - Ross! - Yes, sir. You know Mr Johnson? By reputation. Mr Johnson is interested in the boats. - These the other boats? - Yes. Theyre in first-class shape, Ross sees to that. How would l know? Lets shake down the Kingfisher and lll tell you. Ross, he wants to take a ride. Youre on, Skipper. Hey, dont rev it up so much. l dont want burnt valves. - lf l want. - Cast off, Papa. - Comin aboard, Papa? - No, l gotta stay with Mama. He doesnt wanna get hot-rodded around by you. Know something, Mr Johnson? You may be right. OK, Captain Blood. Can we go home now? - Why not? - Can you handle a following sea? - Like to try? - No! - Unless you can get some speed up. - Speed, huh? OK. - Are you gonna buy the boats? - At a price. - l bet. Three top boats. - Whats wrong with the fourth? - Whatd you do with the sailboat? - Make like a gentleman of the sea. lf the old manll throw it in. - lt wouldnt suit you. - l have a girl it would. - Wholl teach you to sail? - She will. lts her second-favourite sport. Your butterflies opened. Two of em. Thats the sea, unpredictable. Have to clean the carburettor. Shouldnt take a good mechanic over five minutes. Can you hold that for me? Keep it turned away from you. lts a little messy, you know. Ross! Ross! Hello, Suzie Wong! - Arent we getting repetitious? - l came, l saw, l left. l leave now. You were very late. l waited. - You picked up an ageing gentleman. - My father. Thats no gentleman, thats my father. - lll make my own jokes, thanks. - lts not funny. lts sad. You didnt show. Hes in town so l called him. Why am l always explaining? Maybe its something you do. The hotel never heard of you. - Trust me on that one. - Why? Because l went to the trouble of asking where l could find you, and you like games as well as l do. Come aboard and play. - Tell me the rules. - l got a feeling youd cheat. Thats usually what ladies say to gentlemen. - l just came to mend fences. - Ever tried canvas? - Can you stitch? - l kicked the habit. - Sit down. Coffee? - Save it for tonight. - What happens tonight? - Dinner. lm taking you to dinner! Well eat at my bosss house. - lf youre broke... - lm not. l hope youre not dreary about money. We go where l can afford or not at all. lts Papa and Mama Stavros anniversary. lll meet you at 7.30 sharp. No wandering around hotel lobbies. 7.30 sharp.

And dont you follow me! Sir? Could you tell me...? Scat! Get outta here! Scat! - This is really your family, isnt it? - Well, sort of. l never knew my mother. We lost her when l was born. When my dad died, l had to sell the boat to pay for everything, so... You dont have to explain to me. lm sorry theyre leaving. Quiet, please! Quiet! A toast from Linda and me to Mama and Papa, for taking the trouble to meet, marry and get us born. lt was no trouble at all! Excuse me. Many happy years to you, Mama and Papa Stavros. Best of health. - This is for you. - Thank you, Ross! - Ross, what do l get? - You got Mama! Please, dont cry, Mama. Thats not good for you. Mama! - lts so pretty! - l know, but dont cry. Shes running just fine. Just fine. You love this boat. Oh, yeah. My father and l spent every spare minute working on it. We measured, sanded and polished every board. My dad was a great guy. Youd have liked him. And then, the day it was finished was the day he died. Somehow the boat meant... lm sorry. Were getting too serious. Were supposed to be relaxing! Nice day, nice breeze... - Nice boy. - Nice girl. - l like you! - l dont know why! Lets live to find out! KO V Marine Channel repeating emergenct weather report. Hold the tiller, Laurel.

Laurel, you sleep with me. Ross, you on couch. - Goodnight. - Night. Night. l must have gotten the wrong fortune cookie. Laurel...? Laurel! Laurel! Ahoy, West Wind! One if by land... ...and two if by sea. We can weigh anchor, Admiral. lm ready. lts no fit night for man nor beast. lts not sensational here, either. - Frightened? - Terrified! Lets watch. Good idea. Why do you feel so much more alive in a storm? l dont know. Maybe its because everything seems more intense, more real. This is real. Yes. You sound doubtful. - Youre not too real yourself. - Not yet. - Youre not married, are you? - Almost. ls that what youre running away from? Yes. Lets not talk any more. You still love him? He didnt love me. - l didnt ask you that. - l was hurt. - The whole thing was such a lie. - What about him?

Well, this is sort of an inventory. Ross. l sold the boats. You sold em? All? Johnson said, Take it or leave it. l need the money for the house... - You dont have to explain. - Well, l just... How soon does he take over? - Ross. The trouble is... - lll get my gear packed. No, no! Tonight, tomorrow... Goodbye, now. - Where will you live? - Chen can take me in for a while.

You were going to let me take you home, werent you? l live at 1 36 Bay Street. lll be waiting. - l dont know how long... - lll be waiting! - We knock, Skipper. - And we take advantage of old men. This was no Greek bearing gifts. l paid. Will you sell the West Wind? Depends. l dont own anything without a price. - How much? - Ten thousand. - What dyou pay Stavros? - Six. - Youre a thief! - A businessman. Got the money? - You know l havent got any. - Why are you wasting my time? Johnson... Whatll you do with the fishing boats? Dry dock. Painting and refitting. Theyll be out of circulation for a while. And so will you. - Want to work for me? - Doing what? - Fishing for tuna. - No dice. - lll tell you... - lll tell you what youre gonna do. Get your junk off my sailboat. Now. Hold on, Skipper! Youll get nowhere with games like choking the Kingfishers engine. All that did was let me knock the sale price down. All right, you want a job? Then will you sell me the boat for so much a week? Everythings for sale. But l wont promise not to sell her. - What do you pay a captain? - Captain? Shouldnt you be a deck-hand first? Sixty bucks a trip. lf you really want the boat, make two trips a week. - Commercial captains get a percentage. - Not if theyre inexperienced. Why pay me a salary? This way, the more l haul, the more we both make. - What percentage? - Ten percent. - Two. - Seven. - Five and l see the books. - OK. Deal. - Chen Yung goes with it. - Sure. - Thats how generous l am. - Real generous. - Drink? - lf yours is a Mickey. You know, l like you. You remind me of me. - Trying to get me to blow the deal? - Be here tomorrow. 3 a.m. - And you can stay on the sailboat. - Want me to maintain it, too? You will, Skipper. You will. - l came to talk to you, Sam. - Good. - Well? - Got room for another singer? The other dame sings, too? Youre becoming a specialist. - l sing. - lve been telling you that. - lm available. - What made you decide, now? - Money. - lve offered you money before. l didnt need it before. How much can l make? Scale to begin with. More if youre a big draw. This wont affect Robin. She stays. Of course. She stays. Sam, dont say anything about it. lll tell her tomorrow, OK? - Where are you going? - l got a date. - Theres a nice crowd. Go on now. - l cant tonight. Fishing, singing and hunting? That makes for a full day. Youre gonna have to give up something. Come on, Ross. l want to see if l made a good deal. All right, Sam. - Doctor Livingstone! - Hi! Somehow this isnt how l imagined the big reconciliation. Good evening. Regular patrons know Ross Carpenter, whos sung here many times. Tonight, Ross sings for the first time as a professional. Hell be here regularly from now on. Lets all wish him a lot of luck. Thats what l was trying to tell you. Thought you were letting me tell her. Thanks. Sorry. Play it again! More! - More! - Come on! More! Ross? Ross? - More! - Sing it again! - Robin, l was going to... - You go the whole route, dont you? Pull the rug from under me, take the bread out of my mouth. lt sounds complicated. lm keeping the wolf from the door. - From the boat! - lm singing for the money to buy it. lm doing two jobs at once. lt doesnt affect you. You bet it doesnt. - Can l go now? - Anchors away! - Youre a busy boy! - Youre not on my back, too! The other one was just here. She went that-a-way. Laurel! Laurel! - People dont stand me up. - lm not people. And this is your second try. - What were you doing with Robin? - Sam gave me a job. - Fishing? - Yeah, the place is full of tuna! Very funny! When lm not working for Johnson, lm here. When do you work at us? Split shift? - l need the money. - Money isnt that important. Not when youve got it. lts important to me. How come it isnt to you? - lts what you buy that matters. - Hes not going to give me the boat. - And not much else means anything. - Thats right. Until l do buy it. l thought it was Robin. l wish it was, l could fight that. - You dont understand. - lve never wanted anything that badly. Who and what are you that lets you play it this cool? Did you forget something? lm sure she isnt cool and she really understands. Why dont you go back to her? - No comment? - lm thinking of the answer. - Have you found it? - Yeah, lve found it. Lets see if we catch more bait than tuna. Havent had much luck catching anything yet. Wheres the bait? We got a net full of water! We havent got enough bait for a sardine, much less a tuna! Start the engines. Lets make another haul. Head out to sea, Chen. Hey! Kill the engine! Take it out of reverse! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Gee, Ross. lm sorry. Oh, well. Save the pieces. Johnsonll want to count em. We go home now? Unless you want to catch a tuna by hand! - Oh, no! - Oh, no! - Lot different than game fishing. - Or shrimping. l used to do that off New Orleans. New Orleans. l wish l was there right now. - Well, lll be... - How long to fix it? - Too long. - How soon for a new section? No wonder youre in a hurry. lf that trips a sample, youll have to live out there. Mr Johnson! Thats it. - One ton! - l read more. - Maybe 20 pounds more. - 1 ton, 20 pounds. How much? lll have to check todays prices. Lets go to the office. Where you got that trick adding machine! Why the For Sale sign? How do you sell a boat if you dont let people know its for sale? Thought you had a girl that just loved sailing? That was last week. This week, she likes staying home. - Knitting. - Youre funny. Honey, whats todays price? Now give me the one on tuna. Thank you, honey. Your cuts $23. So, figuring $1 1 0 for a new section, you owe me $87. Mr Johnson, dont go without food and water until you get it. - You wanted a percentage. - On profit! - Wheres the profit? - Next trip. lf l make a next trip. - l got 20 bucks says you will. - lts a bet. lll show you what kind of guy l am. Call it square. - lll pay for the net. - No. - $23 and you pay for the net. - No. All right. You owe me $20 on your bet, because lm through. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty. Skipper! 21 , 22, 23. Youre a rough beginner! lm learning from you, Pops, lm learning from you! - Hi! - Hi! Dont be nervous. l come as a friend. - Why are you all made up? - This is what ladies wear to work. - This is called a hat. - Oh, a hat. - l got a job. - As what? Mata Hari? No, selling ladies hats. Nothing mysterious about that. - Are you still mad at me? - No. - How are things? - Not too good. - Hes selling the boat. - l know. - What about that lunch? - l cant. lm due at the shop. - Arent you carrying this too far? - Theres dinner. - ld like to cook for you. - You know what youre doing? Youll find out when you taste the cooking. Remember the address? - 1 36 Bay Street. - And lll be waiting. - Try not to detour this time. - Try not to detour this time! - Hello! - Do something! - What? - The ovens on fire! Dont get excited. - Got any salt? - Just ground pepper or oregano. - Looking for salt? - No, a place to hide. - lf l have any, it will be up there. - Thanks. This is salt. lm gonna show you something. lts an old wives trick. Maybe its a little too well done. How can you say that? You dont have an old wife? - lts kind of late... - You never said! You never asked! No! This is white wine. Got any canned shrimp or crab? Yes, but the dressing l bought goes with cheese. - Got any oil? - l dont mind the squeak. - Salad oil! - l have some from the drugstore. Never mind! Forget it. See the little box? Pick it up. Attagirl! Put it in your little hand. Come in here. Light the candles. Take off your shoes. Smoke your corn-cob pipe and dinnerll be ready in a jiffy. Papas gonna cook the dinner. Mustnt play with matches! - Coffee in the living room, Madam? - Please. - Cream and sugar? - Black, thank you. Shall l drown that out? Next door have very far-out tastes in music. l kind of like it. Maybe its the way l feel. - Dinner wasnt that bad? - Best meal l ever cooked! Ross, its still the boat, isnt it? You think lm dingy, dont you? You can want a thing for the right reason. But prepare yourself. - lf shes sold? - Yes. Well, the good thing is l wont have to work for Johnson any more. Shh... ! lts a fight! - Theyre arguing about bracelets. - What did she say? She says if he feels that way, he can have them back. He got em back! Shes working up to bigger things. Theyre not fighting. l hope theyre married! Yeah, me, too. Just trying to make em feel at home. These walls not only have ears, they got hands, feet, broomsticks... My turn! Well, hello! Youre Mr Johnson? Or lm stealing his liquor. - Bloody Mary? - Laurel Dodge. Come in and close the door! - Wont you join me in my vice? - lm touched. But lm on business. ln that case, lll have this later. Sit down. lm better on my feet. lm told its a must with you. - Flattery will get you everywhere. - l doubt it. - ld like to buy the sailboat. - A lot of people would. - They come every morning. - lm here this morning. - lts $1 0,000, Miss... - Dodge. Like in Detroit? You dont have to club me! - 1 0,000 is too much. - But thats the price. - l know what you paid. - Everybody knows what l paid. You have to want to buy more than l want to sell. And l bet you do. - Not that much. - Good. We can forget the boat. - Lunch? A drive? - Seven? - Oclock? Dinner? Even better! - 8,000, thats all lve got. Would you like a loan till next week? The interest would be too high. Stay a while! lm not as tough as l seem. - lm sure. But youre as greedy. - lm just trying to be nice. lf you want to sweet-talk me, do it in numbers! Temper, Miss Dodge! Temper! $ 1 0,000! And toure calling me collect! No, Daddy, $2,000. lve got eight in my account. l know, l just gave it to tou.

Youre gaping, Mr Johnson! lts a Chicago bank. ltll take a few days to clear. The boat can stay here. lm not asking you to wrap it up! Youre in the big time now. Lets not be so shook up. - That lm saving for someone else. - Just one condition. - What? - Dont tell anyone l bought it. - l promise. Let me show you... - Thats not necessary. l have to! Dont want your diamonds caught in the rigging! - Thank you. lll manage. - A toast to the new owner. - lts a custom of the sea. - l look forward to it.

Take it away! - Whats the figure? - Gross weight. - And that? - The days price per ton! - Whats that sneaky little figure? - Sliding scale differential. - What does that mean? - lt means your share is $7 1 .59. Your differential friend has thrown you a curve. l make it $1 03. - Thats without the sliding scale. - Sos our deal. Bigger load, smaller percentage. lts standard. - ln the numbers racket? - Everyone accepts it. Mr Johnson! The more l haul, the bigger your cut. l was nice when you blew your first run. Dont push me! Johnson! ld rather you be honest than nice. - $7 1 is good for a days work. - $1 03 is better. lts what we agreed. $7 1 and 59 cents. Count out the rest, Mr Johnson. You just dont understand business. Johnson! The For Sale signs off. - Usually is when you sell. - Who bought it? Thats classified material, Skipper. Pick up your money. This just came in. l know its new... ...but is it really me? l think it captures your image extremely well, Mrs Figgot. Oh! That one over there has a teeny-weensy bit more elan. l dont think so. This is... lve always loved roses... This one is so beautifully understated, dont you think? - Absolutely muted. - lll take it. - Put it on my account. - Yes. Now... ! Lets check... No! - lm sorry. We ran out of boxes. - Thats all right. l just love the hat! Bye! Laurel... - Where is it? - lts been sold. - lt was mine! - l know. Why didnt you do something? - Are you just going to stand there? - Can we go? This is outrageous. l will not stand for it. - Mr Peabody! - l heard the sound of conflict. - You must be the manager. - Yes, Madam. lm Mrs Figgot. - Thats a name you dont fool with! - lm taking my coffee break. Miss Dodge! - The penalty for desertion... - Mr Peabody!

Got my drink down. - May l use that man? lll pay. You want to rent him or buy him? l want him to sail the West Wind to Paradise Cove. l couldnt possibly spare him.

Make yourself comfortable. l heard sailboats needed sails to sail. They do. - You didnt say it had an auxiliary. - You didnt ask. l could have done this myself. lve been had. Not yet. Your eyes are bigger than your stomach, Mr Johnson. - Guests dont work, Ross. - This one does. Better get it finished. Radio says heavy rains in the next few hours. They did, huh? We find out. Kapu!
