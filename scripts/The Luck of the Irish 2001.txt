But everyone is lucky enough to have one thing in common, One thing that binds everyone together. [ AMERINDIAN MUSIC ] [ APPLAUSE ] Everyone has a heritage, a family history, traditions handed down from grandparents and great-grandparents. Our next performer is Kyle Johnson. [ CALLING ]: Kyle. Hey, I'm down here! Kyle. [ WHISPERING ]: Kyle. [ KYLE ]: But what if I'm not that lucky? What if I'm the only person who doesn't have a heritage? What if I'm...different? I said I'm down here! [ KYLE ]: Can't you see me? [ WHISPERING ]: Kyle. Aah! [ MOTHER ]: Kyle. Huh! It's time to get ready for the game. Go, Eagles! I must have zonked out. I was having this really weird dream about this Heritage Day thingy that's going on at school. - Pregame anxiety. Everybody gets it. I used to dream I was at the game wearing nothing but my underwear. and I was just in the band. You'll do fine, Kyle. You always do. Here, have some yogurt and a fruit bar. It'll help you keep your energy up. That sounds good. I might have some of that myself. Where's our family from, Dad? We're from right here, Son. No. No, I mean, where do we come from? You know, what's our heritage? We moved here from Cleveland. We're Americans, Kyle. That's all the heritage we need. Hey, come on, Kyle. You're gonna be late for the game. Let's go! Don't forget to wear your lucky coin. I had this really weird feeling. Like there was something they weren't telling me. This was the first time our school had ever made it to the State basketball playoffs. [ FANS CHEERING ] Get over, Russell. Find your shot! Tonight was the Quarter Finals, and we were goin' all the way this year. State Champions. [ CHEERLEADER ROUTINE ] And I was the reason why. Yeah! Everything was goin' my way. I was one lucky guy. [ GIRLS ]: There's Kyle! [ BOY ]: There he is! [ GIRL ]: Great, Kyle! [ EVERYONE CHEERING ] Gee, that was a lucky shot. Hey, luck's got nothin' to do with it. Lookin' good, Kyle. Yeah, I taught him everything he knows. [ MORE CHEERING ] Hey, Kyle. Oh! Hi, Bonnie. - You know I'm in charge of the Heritage Day committee. You're in charge of, like, every committee. I mean, somebody's gotta do it. I'm putting together the program, and I wanted to know what you're going to do for Heritage Day. I don't know. I mean, you know, this whole Heritage Day thing, it's like so Public Television. It's your history. Yeah, but I mean, history... You know, it's like so ten minutes ago. Now, sports, That's what's happenin' now. That's where I'm comin' from. Heh! That's right. Well, even if you are some kind of mindless jock, you still got a heritage. Mindless? - America is a nation of immigrants, Kyle, everybody's ancestors came from another country. Yeah, I'm part Cherokee. So, where's your family from? Is Johnson an English name, or did they change it from Johannsen, or something? Uh, we're from Cleveland. Ha, ha. Very funny. Now, come on, you know what I mean. [ BELL RINGS ] Look, uh, I've got a test, OK? See you guys later. Uhh...jocks! [ BELL RINGS ] Time's up, people! Put your test papers on my desk on your way out, please. Thank you. You'd be better off leaving 'em blank, Kyle. Remember, I subtract points for wrong answers. Summer school! [ BOTH LAUGH ] I do it specifically to discourage what you just did-- Guessing at the answers. You know, in real life, you can't depend on luck to make up for not knowing. These answers are all correct. Oh, this looks great! - Thanks. So, is this like Italian food or something? It's something I saw in Eat Smart Magazine. Why? Oh, I just thought, you know... maybe it was, like, an old family recipe. [ CLUNK ] You're lucky your mom makes you such healthy meals, Kyle. It's probably why you're such a good athlete. Kyle just has a natural talent for sports. Yeah, you know, it's probably genetic. I mean, I bet, if you go back far enough, We've had great athletes in our family for generations. You know, great soccer players, maybe? Or, uh, cross-country skiers? Or... bullfighters? You better eat your salad. You don't want the oil to separate. Uh...yeah, Dad. Yeah. UM, I was talking with the girl in charge of the Heritage Day committee-- [ KATE ]: Is it Bonnie Lopez? She's always in charge of everything. I know. [ LAUGHS ] Yeah. anyways, she says that everyone's family comes from somewhere else. I mean, if you go back far enough; we couldn't have always lived in Cleveland. Unless we're Indians. But... We're not Indians, are we? I don't think so. OK, then what are we? You know, where do we come from? I think your great-grandfather moved there from Mount Buffalo. No, Dad. I mean before that, before we came to America. Why are you so interested in your family all of a sudden? I don't know. I mean, you know, with Heritage Day coming up, I don't want to be the only kid who doesn't know what he is. You're Kyle Johnson. You're a good student, A good boy, A great athlete. Just because some people are obsessed with where their ancestors came from, doesn't mean you have to be, too. Mom, I'm not obsessed. Being an individual is what America's all about, Kyle. Doesn't matter where you're from. You can be anything you want to be. [ KATE ]: Fresh ground pepper? [ KYLE ]: There it was again the feeling that they were hiding something from me. At school the next day, I tried to find out what it was. If you're looking for sports trivia, Try Gofindalife.com. Actually, I'm looking for information on my family. You know, my heritage. Man, there sure are a lot of people named Johnson. Yeah, 4 million pages. Maybe you should narrow that search down a little. Uh, why don't you start with your father, and trace your family back that way? Well, I tried that, but I couldn't find him. Did you look in Cleveland? [ SIGHS ] Here, move over, let me try. Look, you don't have to help me. I'm head of the Heritage Day committee, remember? It's my job to help the heritage-impaired. It's not important to me anyway. I mean, so what if Im from Germany, or England, or whatever? Doesn't mean anything to me. Then why were you on the computer? OK, what about your mother's family? Where are they from? I don't know. Well, half of your heritage comes from her, you know. Well, yeah, but... I never really thought about my mom's family. Well, what was her last name before she got married? Don't tell me, You don't even know your mother's maiden name! How are you ever gonna get a credit card? Look, if you really want to find out about your family heritage, you might try talking to your parents. They are your family. I couldn't tell Bonnie that I thought my mom and dad were hiding something from me. That day, after school it got weirder. The first weird thing was my dad's old high school yearbook. He wasn't in it. At least, Bob Johnson wasn't in it. Robert Smith. Bob Smith. [ KATE ]: Kyle. Oh, hi, Mom. What are you doin'? Nothing. Um...I'm gonna go shoot some hoops. OK. - OK. Don't be late for supper. I'm making stir-fry. Why would he change his name from Smith to Johnson? You know, I mean, if you're gonna change your name, at least change it to something interesting. Or, you know what? Maybe he didn't pick it. Maybe it was the F.B.I. or something, like they gave him a new identity. No, man. you gotta be, like, a hit man or something before they'll let you do that. Nah. Man, how do you make those shots? You know what? Maybe they were, like, these big radicals in the sixties, you know? And they had to go underground? Yeah, or you know what? Maybe they're really aliens, and they got stranded on Earth, when their spaceship crashed. You...just touched the rim! Yeah, I did! Ha! My dad measures me, like, every week to see if I'm getting taller. Then he measures my vertical jump. Man, if I could touch the rim... Man, you sure are lucky. What does luck have to do with how high you can jump? You're the luckiest guy in school, Kyle, everybody knows it. You know what, I think it's because of that lucky charm. Maybe it really works. - What, this? Nah, this is just something my mom gave me when I was a baby. Hey, check it out! Somebody lost $10! Luck and a half, man. You're always finding money lying in the street. Hey, we're a team, all right? I'll split it with you. Cool. Hey, man, check it out. Hey, you know what? I saw that guy on TV once. No, no, no. The thing behind him... it's the same as my coin. I thought it was, like, Chinese or something. Hey, you know what? I think this guy's Irish. Maybe my mom's Irish. [ CELTIC FLUTE & DRUMS ] [ AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE SCREAMS ] [ CELTIC MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ MAN ]: Top o' the morning to you, heh heh. Top o' the morning to you. Heh heh. Top o' the morning to you, heh heh. Hi. Yo, the feet are the bomb, but, like, what's with the arms? It's something called Step Dancing. Now, why wouldn't your mother want you to know if she was Irish? I don't know. I just get this really weird feeling whenever I talk to her. I mean, it's like they don't want me to know anything about my heritage. I didn't know you really cared about this heritage stuff. Well, I don't. I mean, I didn't, anyway. Now I feel like I'm missing something. Yeah. Top o' the morning to you. Ah, sweetie, top o' the morning to you. [ SHRIEKS ] Ha, maybe I should read this. Look! Heh, they have these good luck thingies like yours. Those are just, you know, fake. Mine's real gold. Right. [ IRISH ACCENT ] You can always tell the real thing. Yeah, I guess so. Did you make those yourself, or is it your ma still does it for you, and you half-grown? You mean, my shoes? They're called basketball shoes, Sir. Yeah, you buy them at a store? At the store, is it? Oh! [ KYLE ]: Yeah. Ow! And what'll become of your feet when the road becomes hard and stony? Oh, look at this, boyo. Good Irish leather, eh? Soft as a spring shower and tough as a landlord's heart. Hey! You can't put your feet up there. Get the boys a bag of spuds. Hey, how'd you do-- [ RUSSELL ]: Where'd he go? [ CLAPPING AND CHEERING ] [ ANNOUNCER ]: Ladies and Gentlemen, Seamus McTiernan, Saint of the Step! [ IRISH ACCENT]: If you hail from the shores of the Emerald Isle, or wish you did... if the blood in your veins is as green as a shamrock and your heart's full of blarney, then the Saint of the Step loves you! If you believe in the Little People, and you know that there's a pot o' gold at the end of every rainbow; then you belong to the Saint of the Step! [ IRISH DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ] Man, is this bogus or what? Kyle? Kyle? Kyle, what are you doing? I don't know! I can't help it! Sorry, kid. Heh heh heh. Top o' the morning to you. [ ALARM CLOCK RINGING ] [ RINGING STOPS ] Ow! Uhh! [ KATE SINGING ] [ IRISH ACCENT ]: Ah! Top o' the morning to you! Did you do something to your hair, Mom? I just thought I'd try a more natural look. Now, sit yourself down, and I'll put your breakfast on the table. Is that bacon I smell? It is, and I've a pair of hen's eggs frying for each of you. [ BOB ]: Bacon and eggs? Isn't that a little heavy on the cholesterol? [ KATE ]: It's time you put some meat on your bones. Now, sit down, the two of you. Does Ma sound a-- I mean, does Mom sound a wee bit-- I just said, "a wee bit." Yeah. I've been thinking about what you said, Kyle, about your heritage, and there's something I have to tell you. Uh, Kate, are you sure this is the right time? I mean-- Oh, it's no use trying to hide it, Bobby. It's about me family, Kyle. Kate, why don't we just go out and-- We're Irish. Why didn't you guys tell me about this before now? Oh, I wanted to protect you, Kyle, from the way it was when the Irish first came to America, from the jokes and the dirty jobs nobody else would take, and the signs in the shop windows saying: "No Irish need apply." I wanted you to be 100% American. Mom, that Irish immigrant stuff was, like, over 100 years ago; wasn't it? I remember, when I was a little boy, my mother used to make bacon and eggs every morning for breakfast, and we'd have white bread, toasted, with a lot of margarine on it and then-- hen's eggs and a rasher of bacon. Potato cakes, bangers, and a black-and-white pudding. What's black-and-white pudding? Blood sausage and pork sausage. And I packed some crubeens and colcannon for your lunch. [ KYLE ]: I mean, it's really weird, you know? At first, it's like she's trying to hide where her family's from, and now she's cooking all this Irish food, and she's even talking funny. OK, so what about your dad changing his name? Oh, well, it really doesn't seem like it's such a big deal now, you know? I mean, at least I know I got a heritage, you know? At least I know I'm-- Hey, some green! Every day. Kyle: YEAH. I guess it must be THE LUCK OF THE IRISH. [ KYLE ]: That was the beginning of the unluckiest day of my life. I lost my homework. it must have fallen-- [ STUDENTS LAUGH ] Hey, lookin' good. What's up, Kyle? Did you eat already? I lost my lunch. Yeah, and on your pants, too. Ew, That's nasty. - [ KYLE ]: Well, I was gonna, you know, buy my lunch, but I lost my money. Well, you want some chips? They're Emerald Isle. Look, that's never happened to me, Russell, all right? I can't remember losing anything, ever. In my whole life. Look, it is just bad luck. It happens to everybody. Hey, Kyle, you want my dessert? Chocolate makes me break out. [ KYLE ]: Yeah. Well, so much for bad luck. Hey, Kyle can touch the rim. No way, man. Yeah, way, man, I saw him do it. Come on. Hey, Kyle! Show 'em how you can touch the rim. Yeah, Come on, Kyle! - Let's see. - Yeah. Show 'em how to do it, Kyle. Get it, man. Do it! [ BOYS ]: Aw! [ LAUGHING ] Get a ladder, man, you can't even get the net. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] [ COACH ]: All right, let's line up, guys. Tonight is the semifinal of the State Tournament. You win tonight, you make history. The first time this school has ever had a basketball team make it to the Championship Game. [ BOYS ]: Yeah! All right! [ COACH ]: All right, all right, listen up. There's no running on game days. To make sure everybody stays sharp, I want everyone to make 10 foul shots before you go home. That's make 'em, not take 'em. Russell, start us off. [ EVERYONE ]: Come on, Russ. Let's go, Let's go. Any day now. Look, you're trying too hard, Russ. Just relax. Let it drop. [ EXHALES ] End of the line, Kyle. [ COACH ]: Let's keep it moving, keep it moving. Right. [ COACH CLAPS ] [ COACH CLAPS ] [ RUSSELL SIGHS ] Ha! That's 10. Give me 5 more. So, how many you have left? You haven't made any yet? Man, I've never seen you go ice cold like this. Yeah, That's because I've never been ice cold. Well, you want me to hang till you make your shots? [ SIGHS ] Nah, man, It's cool. I'll catch up with you at the game. - Sure. [ SIGHS ] I think you need a little more arc in that shot. I just lost my temper for a second. I don't want to perpetuate a stereotype, but they say the Irish are a little hotheaded. How did you know I was Irish? - Russell told me. So, what are you gonna do for Heritage Day? I saw some Irish dancing over the weekend. Maybe I could do that. You're gonna learn to step dance between now and Heritage Day? Didn't look that hard. Well, everything's easy for you, isn't it? What's wrong with you? What, are you mad about something? I've known you for a long time, Kyle. You're a nice guy and all that, but you'd be a better person if everything hadn't always been so easy for you. Look at basketball. - The last game? You guys were outplayed, but you won anyways Because you got lucky! The State Championship isn't supposed to be something you just luck into. Look, just because you know everything does not mean you know anything about basketball. Lucky shot. That wasn't luck. That was practice. You know, hard work? What do you mean, practice? You don't even play basketball. [ KYLE ]: It was the perfect ending for the worst day of my life. Too bad it wasn't over yet. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] [ CHEERING ] Boo! [ BOOING ] Come on, get him out of the game! Mmmh! [ IRISH ACCENT ] You can do it, boyo! Come on, Kyle! [ CHEERLEADERS CHANTING ] Way to go, Drake! No! I'm open! I'm open! Ohh! Take him out, Coach! Aw, man! [ BOOING ] [ KYLE ]: It was like I never played before. It was awful! I couldn't even make a shot, and half the time, I missed the rim completely. I just-- [ BOB ]: Everyone has an off night, Kyle. I never did before. The important thing is your team won. You're going to the finals! Yeah, thanks to Drake! He played a great game, Especially after Coach took me out. [ IRISH ACCENT ] You don't need to be playing basketball. You should be hurling! Mom, Im not sick. I just played lousy. [ SIGHS ] Are you sure you're feeling all right? I might drink a bit of a warm bonnyclabber before I go to bed. [ ALARM CLOCK RINGING ] [ RINGING STOPS ] [ IRISH ACCENT ] Do you smell something, Da? I mean, Dad. Smells like something's burning. Ah, boys, there's nothing like a peat fire to put the taste of Eire in your breakfast. Ah-- [ COUGHS ] [ COUGHING ] [ COUGHS ] My dad says if we don't win tonight, he's gonna adopt the other team. Hey, you look shorter. I think maybe I'm having a growth-spurt. No, I'm just, uhyou know, packing on a little weight. My mom's on this Irish kick. We had spuds again-- I mean, potatoes. Hey... maybe that's why they blocked so many of my shots last night. I wasn't getting enough vertical jump. You were moving OK... like you always do. So, you think everybody's gonna be ticked at me 'cause I played so lousy? Look, they're not gonna turn on you over one game. Besides, we're still going to the Finals. Yeah. I can't believe he did that! He's so pathetic. - Loser. You loser! [ GIRL ]: Real nice. Way to choke, Johnson! [ BOY ]: Hey, watch me touch the rim! Hey, looking good, girls. Heh, heh. Oh, look, there's Drake. Hi, Drake! Great game! - Drake, Hi! - Good game, Drake. - Hey Drake! Well, he did play a great game. Hey, Kyle. I Just wanted-- - I got to go to class. Sorry. [ BELL RINGS ] Can anyone tell me what a magnet is? Heh, heh. Holly! A piece of iron that attracts another piece of iron. Good, but a magnet doesn't just attract iron. Man, one bad game, and I feel like I'm nobody. Kyle, since you feel like talking, why don't you tell us what 3 kinds of metal are attracted by a magnet. Ah, iron and, um... Anyone?.. Russell! Iron, cobalt, and nickel. Very good. Iron, cobalt, and nickel. Now, take your magnet, and one of the metal objects in front of you. If that object is attracted to the magnet, then it must contain either iron, cobalt, or nickel. [ CLANK ] I thought you said that was solid gold. It is. Magnets don't lie, man. No, no, no, no.... This is different! This isn't my lucky coin. Look, I've got to call my mom, all right? I bet that coin was like a family heirloom or something. That's probably why she wanted me to wear it. No, that's probably why you had such a bad game last night. Man, somebody must have stolen it Ohh! Oh, for the love of Mike! Kyle! Kyle, I need to talk to you. Look, I'm a little busy right now. He lost his lucky charm thingy - What? It's a gold coin. It's probably, like, a hundred years old. Ahh, Got it. - That's just a quarter. Does he look shorter to you? Nah. He just bulked up. There's something wrong with this stupid phone. Look, Kyle, I have to go. I'm going on a field trip with the Young Achievers, And I just wanted to say, I hope nothing I said yesterday threw off your game. You know, about you being lazy. - Lazy? You never said I was lazy. - I mean, all that other stuff about everything being too easy for you, about not deserving to win the State Championship. Whoa, check out that hair! Man, my dad won't let me dye mine. He's got this thing about Dennis Rodman. [ EXHALES ] Tonight's the State Championship, man. If you cut school without an excuse, the Coach might not let you play. An excuse? OK. First I find out I've been robbed, now my hair is turning red! Hey, I used to be taller than you. [ IRISH ACCENT ] Oh, saints preserve us! I am gettin' shorter. Mom, Dad, there's something wrong with-- There's something your mother and I need to tell you, son. I am a leprechaun, Kyle. Huh? Mom? - I know it's hard to believe, Kyle. I mean, when I first met your mother-- You're not a leprechaun, too? No! No. I'm from Cleveland. Oh. - We'd have told you sooner, Kyle, but we wanted you to grow up like a normal American boy. But then when I started to have this wee little spell-- Mom, you're a foot tall. Oh, it could be worse, believe me. It's probably just an allergic reaction. Boiled potatoes, something like that. I don't think you have any reason to worry. What? Me? You mean, I'm a leprechaun, too? And what else would you be? And you, with the blood of the Clan O'Reilly rushin' about in your veins. Doesn't mean you can't lead a perfectly normal life, Kyle. - Normal? Yes. - Normal? Dad, look at my hair, and...I'm getting shorter. You don't look short to me. [ IRISH ACCENT ] How's it look, Da? Maybe an inch... ...or two. Two inches? Dad, you said this was like, an allergic reaction or something. [SIGHS ] How long's it take to wear off? - Well... actually, it's never happened before. [ FLUTE PLAYING ] According to your mother, as long as the O'Reillys have their luck, every member of the clan can pass as a normal human. Ordinary size, all of that. of course, I'm not really sure how it all works. Well, OK. OK. Well, maybe that's the trouble with Mom, You know, I mean, maybe we're just out of luck. No. No. That can't be the problem. Well, how do you know that? Your lucky coin. That's the luck of the Clan O'Reilly. [ FLUTE CONTINUES ] [ SIGHS] Mom. Mom, I lost my lucky coin. What's this about losing your coin, when it's hangin' about your very neck? Look. it's not mine. It's fake. Somebody must've switched it with the real one. [ WHISPERING ] The dirty thief! It's nothin' but a bit of iron and gold paint on it. Are you saying somebody stole your coin? You know, I bet it was this really weird old guy me and Russell talked to at THE LUCK OF THE IRISH, You know, that Seamus McTiernan dancing thing? Yeah, I bet he was like a pickpocket or something. Wasn't that show at the fairgrounds? Kyle, you know you're not supposed to go there without asking us. Look, Dad. I just wanted to learn about my heritage. You can't blame him, Bobby, And we not telling him the truth. Now, what's this about an old man? Gray in the hair, was he? Yeah, I mean, he started walking up to us and talking about his shoes. Said he made 'em himself. Was it a snake he had on the sole of his shoe? Yeah. Yeah, it was. The miserable old sinner, to play such a trick, And you his own grandson. He was my grandfather? He's your grandfather O'Reilly. And may his name be cursed for a liar. Oh, I'll not let him get away with it, If I have to pry the coin out of his thieving fingers meself. And he me own Da. I knew we should've moved as soon as they built that new potato chip factory. We were bound to run into him sometime. You mean, Emerald Isles? Sure, and it's he that owns the whole company, and still can't stew oatmeal without burning it. Come along, boys! And we'll shame him with what he's done. Uh... Uhh! Unh! Ahh. Honey, I think maybe I should drive. Yeah. [ KATE ]: Ohh! Ooh! Oooh! Ooh! Kate, I think you should wait in the car. You might...attract attention. D'unh! That's how it was when we first came to this country, hmm? People looking down on ya 'cause you're a bit different. Uh, Mom? Am I gonna get as small as you are? Ah, you're only half leprechaun, Kyle. It'll be days before you're down to this size. Plenty of time for me to make you some wee little ghillies for your feet. Don't worry, Kyle. We'll get your coin back. [ IRISH ACCENT ] He says, he's married to Mr. O'Reilly's daughter. Right. [ SIGHS ] [ IRISH ACCENT ] The tour group is here. Son, relax. Listen, everything is gonna be fine. If my grandda is right-- I mean, granddad Why don't I ever get to see him? Because I'm not... because I'm not a leprechaun, and they don't believe in mixed marriages. That's why we had to leave Cleveland. We even changed our names, so Kate's family couldn't find us. Well, if you and Mom, you know, like, love each other, why should it matter? Well... sometimes leprechauns can be small-minded. Come on. Right, sir. I'll handle it. Mr. O'Reilly says he doesn't have a daughter, and for you to go away and not to be bothering him again. I'm not leaving here until I see Mr. O'Reilly. Aah! Oof! Are you OK, Da? Oh! Don't worry, Kyle, we're not giving up. Just gonna talk a little strategy with your mother, that's all. Yeah. Oh, look at them. You look so nice. On behalf of our president and founder, Mr. Reilly O'Reilly, I'd like to say welcome to Emerald Isle. Uh, if you follow me, we'll begin the tour. Please stay with the group at all times. Some of the machinery can be dangerous. Now, the potato chip was invented in the late 1800s, when a cook accidentally sliced some potatoes too thin and discovered they turned crisp when he fried 'em. As you can see, we've come a long way since then. Are there any questions so far? Yes? - Will we get to meet Mr. O'Reilly? Oh, no! Mr. O'Reilly is far too busy to be seeing us today. Where's his office? It's in another part of the building. Now, if you'll follow me, we'll first see how the potatoes are washed. What are you doing here? Shh! Come on. You're not a Young Achiever. I have to talk to Mr. O'Reilly. - Why? Remember how I told you my coin was stolen? Well, I think he's the one that took it. He's like a millionaire. Why would he steal your coin? Because he's my grandfather. Why would your grandfather steal your coin? Do you have to know everything? He and my mom don't really get along, And I guess he did it to get back at her. I think we have intruders. [ KLAXON BLARING ] [ MEN SHOUTING ] Come on! [ KLAXON CONTINUES ] [ GUARD ]: Come on, guys! Why is your grandfather mad at your mother? Because she married my father. Why doesn't he like your father? Because he's not a leprechaun. What? Ooh! We've got 'em! Come on! [ KLAXON CONTINUING ] Unh! Whoa! Get in! Go! Ohh! Oh! Ahh. [ BONNIE SCREAMS ] [ BONNIE SCREAMS AGAIN ] Get off. Aah! Aaaaah! Whoa! [ KLAXON STILL BLARING ] Uhh! Unh! Let go! Aah! Aah! Kyle! Oof! Aaaaah! Aaaah! Oof! Better not bake this one, boys. I think it's me grandson. [ KYLE MOANS ] Oh! Oh! I thought I was baked. A good boy like you has got nothing to fear from the oven. Aaah! Kyle! Oof! Ohh! Kyle. Kyle, are you all right? [IRISH ACCENT ] Ahh, Yeah. At least I found me grandda. Oh. Oh, Kyle. What? Oh, no. Im turning into a Vulcan. Ohh. Sydney. - Mr. O'Reilly. You'll feel better after having a lie down in me office. Or better yet, make yourself a pair of shoes. It's good for the soul. When you make your own shoes, You're the master of your feet. [ KYLE ]: Look. I don't want to make a pair of shoes, and I don't want to be a leprechaun. Oh, there's no use railing against what you are, boyo. If green's just not your color, then why don't you put your coin back on? Or has your ma not told you, It's the coin that lets you pass for human? Look. I don't have my coin. all right? you do. You took my real coin and switched it with this fake one so I wouldn't know about it. I did no such thing, boyo. And I'll not have you blacken me name by saying I did. Huh! I'll wager it's your ma who took it... to turn you against me. Oh, it's a traitor, she is... and to her own people. My mom doesn't have the coin. She's changing faster than I am. She's this tall. Really? [ TOUR GUIDE TALKING IN BACKGROUND] Is it truly stolen? Fine. None of your ma's tricks. Oh, no. no. no. It can't be. Why, without our luck, the O'Reilly clan would start to-- Am I--Am I lookin' a bit green? And me trousers could use a roll. Now, why aren't you getting short as fast as my mom did? It's not easy for an old man to change. Well, what does Kyle's lucky coin have to do with everybody turning into a leprechaun? It's not Kyle's luck. It's the luck of the Clan O'Reilly. It's all that's held us together for a thousand years and more. A thousand years of invasion and oppression and being forced from the land. A thousand years of stoney fields and famine, saying good-bye forever as you get on a boat for a distant shore. and now, when we finally made it here in America and are just about to have all our luck, You've lost it! Well, why did I have to wear it? Huh? Why not you or Mom? You're the youngest member of the Clan O'Reilly, and it's always the young that have all the luck. Uhh! Oh, I might as well go lie down in the gutter. It's nothing but bankruptcy and ruin for the O'Reillys Now that our clan is out of luck. Hey, luck isn't everything. I mean, it wasn't luck that built this factory. Oh, a lot you know. Ha ha ha. And I might still be a short-order chef if it had not been for a bit of luck one day when I sliced the spuds too thin. Are you saying you invented the potato chip? That was over 100 years ago. This is all my fault. I mean, everything was going great until I started trying to find out what I was. Now I got red hair and pointy ears. I wish I never would've found out anything. I wish I didn't have a heritage. There must be something you could do. [ IRISH FLUTE ] If your coin was stolen, you can go to the police. Oh, yeah, and tell them I'm a leprechaun, and I've lost my luck? Yeah, right! Do you have to do that? Of course I do. I'm Irish. That's how I manifest despair. Kyle! No! No! No! [ FLUTE STOPS ] I'm not Irish, I'm an American. Look. maybe I wasn't the only person that got robbed at that LUCK OF THE IRISH thing. You know, maybe they already caught the guy who did it. I'm sure we can talk to Seamus McTiernan. What? That petty-wagger? That stage Irishman with his neon shamrocks and his heart-full-of-blarney rubbish? Why didn't you tell me it was at his show you lost your coin? I would've known it was him that stole our luck. I didn't say it was him. And who else would it be? And him a far darrig, as plain as I'm standing here. [ BOTH ]: A what? Kate! Kate! I can't find him anywhere. I don't know where he is. Da! Kyle! I know who took my coin. it was Seamus McTiernan. Granddad says he's like a far darrig leprechaun. He says they're all thieves and liars. Oh, really? No, O'Reilly. Reilly O'Reilly. And you must be Bobby. Yeah. [ KATE ]: Don't believe a word he says, Kyle. It's he that took it to spite me. Oh, and it'd only be giving you what you deserve, Kathleen O'Reilly, for daring to marry outside the Little People. But I swear on me mother's grave, it wasn't me that-- Ooh! [ KYLE ]: Ma! Don't be wasting your sympathy on him, Kyle, swearin' on his ma's grave, and she still livin' in Sligo, and healthy as a horse! You are a fine one to be callin' me a liar. And did you not tell me when you first met Bobby that he hailed from the shores of Erie? And you knowin' me ears aren't what they used to be, And I'd never guess you meant some lake in Ohio. You guys, that stuff's all in the past. Can't you just forget about it? Forget the past? - Yes. The important thing is what's happening now, today. All right, we've gotta get our luck back before it's too late. Well...maybe it's too late to be objectin' to a marriage and your boy all grown up now like a man. Well, I'll not be apologizing for marrying Bob, But I am sorry for the trouble it caused ya. Let bygones be bygones? There's no time for formalities, boyo. Seamus McTiernan is makin' off with our luck. Come on. Let's after the thief. All right! Oh... Bonnie, look...I gotta go. - I'm going with you. Well, what about the Young Achievers? They're supposed to be about seizing opportunities. How often do you get an opportunity where you can help a clan of leprechauns get their luck back? [ ENGINE STALLS ] Besides I only joined the Young Achievers because my parents made me. I really wanted to play basketball. But they said the Achievers would look better on a college application. [ ENGINE CONTINUES TO STALL ] I guess it's my car we'll be taking. Fasten your seat belts... and it'll be a bumpy ride. So, uh...Grandda, am I gonna grow a beard like that? Oh, not for a good many years, I'm glad to say. Kyle? Hey. Hey, Kyle. I wasn't sure if-- Whoa. Check out those ears. Hey. Are those real? Are they getting worse? Oh... [ KYLE MOANS ] Are you OK? [ SIGHS ] - What's going on? I think we've got enough people in the car already. Hey. It's that guy with the beard. That's me grandda. Kyle, it's not our way to be tellin' the whole world all about us. Would ya stop your jabberin' and drive the car? Can you not see that the road is clear? Mrs. Johnson? Hello, Russell. [ TIRES SQUEAL ] Aah! You wait here. I'm gonna check this out. Careful, Da. Bobby. Bobby. If you get into any trouble with Seamus, try makin' a bet with him. Ho ho. The far darrig all go wild for gamblin'. Thanks. [ MAN ]: Yeah, let's get this thing set up, huh? [ SECOND MAN ]: All right. Aah! Aah! Aah! They're gettin' away! Don't let him--augh! Don't let him get away! I saw it! There's a whole bunch of gold coins in there! Come on! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ho...ho ho! Ahhh! Oh! Aah! Grandda! Aah! Oh, you better hang on! Ha Ha! Ha ha ha! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ha--Whoo! [ BOB ]: K-keep your head. What are you trying to do? Reilly, you're gonna get us killed! Why don't you give me some of that corned beef and cabbage there, Patrick? I'm always happy to share a meal with a fellow leprechaun. May the road rise up to meet ya, and may it be a slippery one. Watch out! Aah! [ LAUGHS ] [ HORN HONKS ] [ TIRE BLOWS ] Aah! Aah! Quick, get the spare! They're gettin' away! I don't have a spare tire! What?! With all the good luck I've always had, I never thought I'd be needing one. Oh... Oh, I've worked up quite an appetite. Uh, that was the last of the corned beef, sir. [ PLAYING BAGPIPE ] Please, pl--[ SIGHS ] [ CONTINUES PLAYING ] You'd better get home. You got a big game tonight. But what about you? You're the reason that we made it to the State Finals. I can't play looking like this. I never could play anyway. Not really. I was only good because I was lucky. Basketball isn't everything, Kyle. I should know. Well, I can't play baseball or football either. I meant sports isn't everything. Look, I liked who I was, all right? And that's who I wanna be. We should've told you a long time ago. I'm sorry, Kyle. That was our mistake. It's OK, Da--Dad. Things could be worse, Kyle. Yeah? How? Hey, give me a hand with this, Bobby. I think it's stuck. [ ELECTRIC MOTOR STRAINING ] Come on! Eh! It's no use, Grandda. It's just our luck. It's almost enough to make you homesick for Ireland. If you had sense enough not to drive without a spare tire! Or, if you hadn't married me daughter, none of this would've happened. That has nothing to do with anything. - It doesn't do any good trying to blame each other. I mean, I know this is miserable, but-- - Please don't say it could get worse. It might. I was just gonna say that everybody has bad luck, but you can make it better if you just keep trying. I mean, when the Irish came to America, things were tough. And they had to work at jobs other people wouldn't take, and they didn't get paid what they deserved. Well, at least they got paid. The important thing is they didn't give up. They kept trying till things got better, and that's what makes them special, not where they are now, but the spirit that kept them going on the way there. She's a Young Achiever. - I'm an American. That's what we all are, and Americans don't give up. [ KYLE SIGHS ] - Maybe I can walk down to the gas station, and, I'll get a patch to fix that tire. I'm gonna get that top up-on if it kills me. - Alright. Hey, we can get the tire off. - I'll check the trunk for tools. - OK. I'll be goin' with you, Bobby, and not left waitin' in the car. I'd better go, too. I have to go call the Young Achievers. If I get in trouble for leaving the field trip; my dad will give me his: "You're not gonna get into med school" speech. Well, thanks for helping out, Bonnie. I mean, you know, you being here. Kinda' makes me think I haven't lost all my luck. Do you really mean that? Or is it just blarney? Hey, wait up, Mr. Johnson. What? Do you still think we can get our luck back, Grandda? I don't want to be lyin' to ya, boyo. But it would take a miracle to catch Seamus now. Well, at least it's stopped raining. Hey, look, there's a rainbow. Hah. hey, maybe there's a pot of gold at the end of it. Oh...Ha ha ha. Come on, boys. Where are we going? I don't know. Where are we going? To the end...of the rainbow! What? Hey, you OK, Grandda? [ PANTING ] You can't get to the end of a rainbow. Well, I could, if I was only 200 years younger. No. The rainbow's just the sunlight refracted in the clouds, there is no end. You some kind of scientist? I'd like to be one someday. Yes, but Im a leprechaun. So don't be tellin' me about rainbows. Hey, look over there! Come on! [ CELTIC MUSIC PLAYS ] WHILE GOIN' THE ROAD TO SWEET ATHY HURROO, HURROO WHILE GOIN' THE ROAD TO SWEET ATHY HURROO, HURROO WHILE GOIN' THE ROAD TO SWEET ATHY A STICK IN ME HAND AND A DROP... They must've stopped to celebrate or something. I'll give 'em somethin' to celebrate. You boys wait here. I'll slip in and get our luck back. I'll get it. Your ma would never forgive me f I was to allow you to go into a place like that. Look, it's my responsibility. Keep your eyes peeled. WHILE GOIN' THE ROAD TO SWEET ATHY HURROO, HURROO WHILE GOIN' THE ROAD TO SWEET ATHY HURROO, HURROO WHILE GOIN' THE ROAD TO SWEET-- Hey. Here it is. It's locked. [ OFF-KEY BAGPIPE ] [ CLICK ] [ BAGPIPE STOPS ] How'd you do that? It's a leprechaun thing. Ah, it's our luck. Ha Ha. That it is, Kyle boy. Our lucky day. This is my coin. I can tell. It's like this weird feeling. You can never tell about feelings, you know. So why don't we just take the whole lot of it to be certain, hmm? Come on. Give me a hand with the pot, boy. What? Whoa. Grandda, you can't take it all. It's not ours. What? You think that dirty thief deserves it? And he surely stole it from poor leprechauns like ourselves. Well, we don't know that for sure. And if he did steal it, we should tell the police. Are you daft, boy? Callin' in the peelers, when all this gold is just lying there for the taking. You mean stealing. I mean seizing the opportunity. IN DUBLIN'S FAIR CITY WHERE GIRLS ARE SO PRETTY I FIRST SET MY EYES ON SWEET MOLLY MALONE AS SHE WHEELED HER WHEELBARROW THROUGH STREETS BROAD AND NARROW CRYING, "COCKLES AND MUSSELS, ALIVE, ALIVE, OH" ALIVE, ALIVE, OH ALIVE, ALIVE, OH CRYING, "COCKLES AND MUSSELS, ALIVE, ALIVE, OH The streets aren't paved with gold, Kyle. You have to take it where you can find it. If you'd struggled as I did when I first came to this country-- We didn't come to America to steal. We came here to work hard, get ahead, and make something of ourselves. We now, is it? Sure an' it's worth a pot of gold to hear ye count yourself among the Little People... even such a big, lovely pot as this. Aah! Oh! Run, Kyle, run! Run! Run! O'Reilly... Aah! Grandpa! [ FIERCE GROWLING ] Grandpa? Ha! I've got him by the beard, boyo, and no leprechaun can get away from that. Kyle! And you'll not be gettin' away either. Now, give me that lucky coin... and maybe I'll let the old man go. Oh, don't trust him, Kyle. He's a far darrig-- Quiet! - Ooh. Ooh. Ooh! Far darrig? I'll make a bet with you. A wager, is it? What exactly did you have in mind? I bet...that...I can beat you. Beat me what? Video games, is it? TV trivia. Sports. If I beat you at sports, you'll let my grandda go, and I get to keep my lucky coin. But if you don't beat me... then the coin is mine. And no more of this chasin' after me. OK. Well, you've got yourself a wager. Hey, what's going on, Kyle? Where are we? And what are we wearing? It's hurling, Kyle. Grandda? Watch out for the sliotar. The what? The sliotar. Man, what are we doing here? Sports. [ EXULTS ] [ GRUNTING ] [ MEN CHEER ] [ KYLE ]: Look, I bet Seamus I could beat him at sports. [ RUSSELL ]: Man, sports are more like football, baseball, basketball. Rrahh! You may have gotten lucky at hurling, but you'll not be beating me at throwing of the chariot wheel. What kind of sports are these anyway? Do you know nothing at all o' your heritage? It's the Tailteann Games that were played in Ireland for 3,000 years. Oh. Those games. [ GRUNTS ] What do I do now? Aaggh! Aaggh! Punt! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Yes! Do you know why I want that coin? Does it have anything to do with greed? Ha! Its power. Power, boyo, is what I'm after. Taking the luck from every leprechaun in America. It's I that'll have power over the lot of ya. Kyle's on the wrestling team at school. Well, it's just junior high. It's a king we had in Ireland, and it's a king I'll be-- King of the Leprechauns. Yeah? Well, in America, we don't believe in kings. We believe in baseball. Yeah! Oh, ho ho! Without your luck, there'll be no more denying what you are. You'll see how welcome you are in America when you're the Little People again and different from everyone else. Then it's back to the land of Eire, back to the old country and the old ways! Ha ha! Ha ha! This is the last of the sports. If Kyle doesn't win this one, it's all over. But dancing's not a sport. Hoh! It is in Ireland. I am the Saint of the Step! What sort of step is that? Uh, it's my step. Wa ha ha ha! [ LAUGHS ] I'll have that coin now, boyo. What are you talking about? We tied. We said, if you didn't beat me at sports, the coin was mine. Well, a tie's not beating me, so hand it over. Man, what a cheat! Oh, he's a devil for twisting words about. He'd make a liar tell the truth. The coin, boyo, or I'll have to be getting rough with you. [ KYLE SIGHS ] What about my grandda? You said you'd let him go. I said I might let him go, or, I might just make him my slave forever! I bet I can beat you without my luck. What? I bet I can beat you at basketball, even without my lucky coin. You've got nothing left to bet, boyo. If I lose... I'll be your slave. Oh, no, don't do it, Kyle boy. And if you win, you get your luck back, is that it? Yeah. You're not gonna trust this guy again, are you, Kyle? Now, none of that. We're all good Irishmen here. Irishmen. Yeah. OK, so if I win... If...I win...I get my coin back, and you'll live forever in the land of my fathers, and never leave the shores of Erie again. Done. [ CROWD CHEERING ] Go Team Go! [ COACH ]: Work it down forward, and pass it on to you. The fast break is-- Where were you guys? In Ireland. Look, we're here now, all right? Yeah, OK. You get out there and take the tipoff, Kyle. Let's get the lead and keep it. We're not going into double overtime. [ ALL: YEAH! and APPLAUDING ] 1, 2, 3...Go! [ KYLE ]: Hey, this is kind of weird. How'd we end up here? Maybe you should ask him. Do you recognize this, boyo? It's your luck I'm wearing. Isn't he a little old for junior high? Let's just play ball, boys. Look, there's your grandda. Kyle! Woo-hoo! No, no! Transition quickly! Get down and cover your net. Yeah! Hello, old man. Make a run for it, Kyle, before it's too late. Put it in, Kyle. Let's go! I'm not going to give up now. Look, I can beat Seamus if I try hard enough. Kyle, throw it in! You can't do it without your luck. You'll lose, Kyle. You'll be a slave forever. Let's go. Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! Somebody get with those guys. Transition quickly! [ TIRES SCREECH ] Come on. Come on. We're gonna get this back now. We're close. Keep the players working right to the beat. I'm open, I'm open. Ha ha ha! Ooof! Aaaah! [ BOOING ] Russell! Russell! Mr. O'Reilly? Take this lucky coin. And don't ask where it come from. Oh, great. I'll give it to Kyle. Oh, no, no! No, it won't work for Kyle. It's a special coin just for you. Well, hey, thanks! [ CHEERLEADERS ]: Come on! Take it all the way! A boy who believes in leprechauns, will believe in anything! Bring it in, Russell, bring it in! Let's get it back. I'm open, I'm open! Yeah, Russ! Yeah! Way to go, man. Hey, look, it's not just me. Your grandfather gave me this lucky coin. Excuse me. There's Kyle. Seamus! It's OK, son. good foul, good foul. We're gonna rebound. We're gonna bring it back to you, buddy. Let's go. Look, there's Da! Why did you give Russell that coin? I thought you could use a little help... the way you've been playing. But it's fake, isn't it? Sure it is fake. But I wouldn't be telling him that, if you were you. It's confidence the boy be wanting, not some lucky coin. Oh, he's got all the luck he needs right in here. Yeah. the luck's inside him. And mine's inside me. THE LUCK OF THE IRISH! Come on, Kyle, come on! Get in the game. Come on! Make a statement. Oh, give it up, boyo, you're a leprechaun. And a leprechaun's nothing, without his luck. Nobody's nothing. That wasn't luck. Yeah! [ CHEERS ] [ COACH ]: Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah! All right! That's it, Russell! Yee-ha! I touched the rim! Hey! Ooh! [ CHEERS ] Aaaagh! [ CHEERS ] One more, and you've got it-- Ooh! Give me the ball! Aooooh! Ball! Yargh! I am the Saint of the Step! King of the Leprechauns! You'll never beat me! [ WILD CHEERS ] Yes! Yes! That's my son! Argh! [ CRACK! ] Seamus! Come on, get up! You all right there, boyo? [ REILLY ]: You've lost to the boy, Seamus. He beat you fair and square. Now it's time to have our luck back. I lost, is it? Lost what? This? I still got a pot of gold on the bus. And 10 times that, hidden away in a cave at Carraig. Do you remember the rest of our bet? - Oh, I remember it, boyo! Word for word. It's home you're sending me. To live forever in Ireland. [ LAUGHING ] I'll be King of the Leprechauns yet. And then I'll settle with you, and the Clan O'Reilly. I said the shores of Erie. Augh! Would you at least learn how to say it? The land of your fathers Isn't Erie, boyo. it's Eire. My father's from Cleveland. [ GASPS ] Ohio! Aah! Whoa! [ SPLASH ] To live forever within the shores of Lake Erie. Heh! Sure hope he can swim better than he plays basketball. [ CELTIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ CROWD CHEERING ] Luck's got nothing to do with it. I'm proud of you, son. Hooray! Yeah! Bonnie. Where have you been? Did your daughter not tell you she's been all day interviewing for our scholarship program? Scholarship? From Emerald Isle Potato Chips. Why, Bonnie's at the top of our list for a full college scholarship. After she finishes high school, of course. Bonnie, you should have told me. Except there's one thing that might keep her from getting it. You see, we like our scholars to be well rounded. Does she not play some sort of sport? Sport? Oh, yes! She's going to play basketball next year. Is that right, Bonnie? Whatever you say, Dad. Well, you've got one lucky girl there, Mr. Lopez. But...aren't we all lucky, to be living in so grand a country where... ...where anything is possible. Yeah! [ CELTIC DANCE PLAYING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ WOMAN ]: Very good! All right! Yeah! Well, I'm really proud of my Mom's family, and my Irish heritage, But Americans come from all over, and not just one place, and so do I.
