Don't let me slow you down.|It's just... Well, you're a surprise. - How do you mean?|- You have great spirit. But just a tad more|volume, if you would. - I apologize.|- Continue. Like, whoo. Like, whee.|I'm at the university. I'm psyched. I'm here. Hope|I'm the one you choose to cheer. I yell real loud and make|the Stingers super proud.! Brilliant.! My dear, you are wonderful...|cheer genius personified. A real individual. I'm joking, you spaz! - Pardon me?|- That was a cheer? That was the most boring, unoriginal,|biggest piece of crap I've ever seen! You suck! Mom, where are we?|Where are you, dear? You finally made it.|You're in college. Oh, man! Hi. Can you guys tell me|how to get to Bancroft Hall? Hi. Can you tell me|how to get to... Hi, girls. Can you guys tell me|how to get to Bancroft... Excuse me! Hi. It's where some|of the cheerleaders are staying. Um, I'm trying out|for the team. You girls don't cheer,|do you? First of all,|it's women, not girls. Oh. Second, um, we|do neo-modern ballet. We don't wave pom-poms. And third, we can't direct|you to Bancroft Hall, because Nathaniel Bancroft was|a slave owner and an imperialist! Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. You're not giving up|already, are you? Monica! First day of college,|I'm already saving my roommate. You did not have to save|me. I have been saving... your butt ever since|cheerleader camp. Have not! Really?|I remember a time... a spotter was out of position|and one of our cheerleaders... was gonna do|a face-plant. Who was that cheerleader|again? Okay. Okay. I get it. I think the score|is Monica, two. Whittier, zero. And... Bancroft Hall|is this way. Did you know that Nathaniel|Bancroft was a slave owner... and an imperialist? Our|room has a ceiling fan. As well as paint balloons,|panty trees, super-gluing faculty doors,|releasing lab animals... and most important,|I'd like to remind you... that if you must... urinate, please...|do it in a toilet. Do not... I repeat...|Do not urinate... on an original manuscript|of The Canterbury Tales... located|in the school library. You writing this down? You'd|think I wouldn't have to say that. The Nutcracker|is a patriarchal ballet. Okay? The only good thing in The|Nutcracker are the rats, and they die. Shakespeare. Hamlet? "Euripidie..."|Euri... Eur... Euripides. Lastly, we hope you take advantage|of the many extracurriculars... here at the university. Although I must report|we've had to cut funding... to some of the more|non-essential programs... on campus such as|the martial arts club, - the ballet society...|Wha... and the entire|musical theater department. That's a worthwhile program.!|Fortunately, we haven't had to cut any money|from our two prized programs... the football team...|That's right! - Yeah!|- And... your seven-time... defending collegiate champion|Stinger cheerleading squad! - Yea!|- Let's hear it for our heroes.! Tina.! Tina.! Tina.! Tina.! Tina! Tina!|Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina! Hey, everybody!|I'm Tina Hammersmith! Y'all ready|to rock the body electric? - Ahhh!|- Let's get this party started! Five, six,|seven, eight! Whoo.! Yeah.! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.!|You go, girl.! Two, three, four... Stingers in the house!|We're on the attack! - That's right!|- Got no extra fat! We don't eat Big Macs!|It's gross! - Step to us.! You might get smacked.!|- Whacked.! We got more game|than the man they call Shaq! The moonwalk! The twist!|The shake and bake! The what? We can do it all|right here at State! Strap yourself in|so your mind won't blow! Sit back, relax|and enjoy the show! What's wrong with you people? Stop it! Yeah! Stingers! This is terrible. What|do you mean "terrible"? - They're perfect.|- I know. That's what's terrible. They are perfect. Speaking of perfect. You|ever checked out your own ass? Whoa!|Gross! Just pay him no mind. No. No.|I think we should pay him mind. I mean, this... this man|has a lot to say. I do. - I have a lot to say.|- He's a unique individual. - Very unique individual.|- With his own thoughts and ideas. My own thoughts.|My own ideas. - Who would never make a fool of himself.|- Never ever... make a fool of myself. Even if he|was blindly mimicking whatever I said. Even if I was blindly... Hey, punk.|Be watchin' you. Smart guy. Thank you.|No problem. Belly ring?|No belly ring? It's a cheerleading tryout. They're|going to be looking at your moves, not your body jewelry.|Oh, I know. But here's my theory:|If they concentrate on my belly, they won't recognize if I|mess up on my back handsprings. Whit, you're not gonna mess up.|I've seen your cheer skills. They're for real. Maybe for high school,|but this is college. And in college|you have to be the poo. Well, that shaggy boy at orientation|sure thought you were the poo. He was all on you|like ugly on an Osbourne. Him? You think? He did smile at me. Mm-hmm. But I can't lose my concentration.|I've really got to focus on tomorrow. I got to work on my|cheer moves. Hit it, girl. Before we begin, I want you to|know that just by trying out today, you're already a winner. Unless, of course,|you get cut. In which case, technically|you're a loser. So, go for it. Okay, I'll start with|a simple aerial. No, I was thinking more|of a front handspring, back handspring,|front handspring, back handspring,|back handspring, front handspring,|back handspring... Okay! Give me an "S- S."|Give me a "T- R." Err! That was awesome. So, do|you got any good cheers? - I got something for ya. I got a little shout out.|- You got a what? I got to give a shout out to|all my people, baby! Whoo! I'm flossin'!|You can't see me. I got the ice. It's just blindin' ya!|Peace, and I'm out! Back handspring, front handspring,|cartwheel, back handspring, cartwheel... Give me an "S- S".|Give me a "T- R". I just screwed up again!|Dang it! I can't believe it! No! Just kill me right now!|Bam! Haha! Please? Front handspring, cartwheel,|back handspring, back handspring, cartwheel...|Ooh. Ohh, yeah!|Oh, my God. Thanks for coming. And lastly,|Smith, comma, Whittier. - Okay. So...|- Wait. - What is it?|- That thing. That shiny offensive|thing... midsection. - Oh, that's my belly ring.|- Lose it immediately. Okay. Sorry. Okay. Um. - Okay. Are you ready?|- How about, are you ready? I think so. Here I go.! Hit it.! - How's that?|- Thank you. Sheila.|Too fat. Kenny.|Too dorky. Brenda.|Psycho! Cindy.|Snaggletooth. Carol-Ann. It's called lotion. Eczema. Theo.|Too gay! - Patrick?|- Not gay enough. And finally, Whittier. - She's okay.|- Okay? Marni, she's future head cheerleader material. Memo, pink ink, we already have|our future head cheerleader. Hi. The only difference being,|she's cute. Yeah, she's cute the way|a smushed-up bug is cute. Oh, and excuse me.|Did you see her blond hair? So fake! Well, if that's not the pot|calling the kettle blond. Ohh! I was...|I was born with dark roots. Mm-hmm. Well, anyway,|I'd be all over her. - You know, if she had a schwinger.|- Maybe she does. Enough.! You two bitches can catfight all night,|but I'm the one that makes the decisions. Until I do...|you're dismissed. Leave me. Ow! - No time for rest, cherub.|- Dean Sebastian. I didn't know you were here.|I've been here six hours. Saw every last peppy pigtail|that passed through this place. Pretty ugly, huh?|Some were ugly. Some were hideous. While others were sublime. I'm talking about|State's next head cheerleader. Smith, comma, Whittier. Whittier can't be head|cheerleader next year. She's just a freshman. She's|just good is what she is. But the head cheerleader spot|is reserved for Marni. Tina! The State|cheerleading squad has won... seven consecutive|national titles, which over that time|has tripled alumni donations... and allowed me the life|to which I am accustomed. Just last year,|I upgraded... from an '88 Jetta|to a 2003 Passat. Wow. I'm not about to|throw all that away... over some brown-nosing|mediocrity named Marni. Whittier might have what it|takes, but she's awfully raw. That, dear, is why|you must mold her. Shape her. Twist her|like Silly Putty. If you make her|half as great as you are, the national title will|stay here for years to come. Remember the school|motto... Whatever it takes. I can't hear you.|Whatever it takes! Welcome to the team. Welcome to the team. Welcome to the...|Oh, uh, this is size four. Is that gonna be too|small for you? Kidding! Kidding!|Get outta here. Welcome to the team.|Wait! This isn't a uniform. These are towels. You're|very perceptive, aren't you? But aren't I on the team? Of course you're on the team.|As a towel girl. It's an honor. How is it an honor? Say there is no towel girl. Say|Greg hoists Tina up into a cupie, and there is no one|to towel off his sweaty hands. Tina slips. Tina falls and-and|lands on her spinal cord, and she spends the rest of her life|doing watercolors with her teeth. Do you want that to happen? I guess not. Hmm. I didn't think so. Man, these colors are hype!|I am never taking this off. Even after you're dead|in the ground? Totally. Congratulations,|my little pumpkins. You have now joined the|best of the best of the best. Here's Marni|with some light reading. Now, study those rule books and|wear those uniforms with pride. People|have given their ankles, ligaments,|collarbones... in service to those very uniforms|you have on your taut little bodies. 'Cause from here on out you|must be the "bomb diggity." You must eat leaner,|train meaner, jump higher, yell louder and out-pep|anyone who stands in your way. You must brush better, floss better,|lather, rinse and repeat better... In other words, you must be better|in every aspect of your life. Are you ready for all that? - Whittier?|- Uh. Uh. Uh... I'm gonna catch you|guys later. All right. Is... - Is everything okay up there?|- Again. Four, five, six, seven, eight. Is everything okay up there? Hey, you're|the orientation guy! Yeah, Orientation Guy|is my given name. But, um, it's not my real name.|My friends call me Derek. Well, hi, Derek.|I'm Whittier. Whittier?|I like it. - It's nice.|- Thank you. - You want to do something illegal?|- What? Do you want to do|something illegal? Shut up.! Uhh. Okay. Really? What kind of girl are you?|Stop! Whoa! No way. No. You're a cheerleader.|You get thrown three stories... in the air every day. Tina would|kill me if I sprained an ankle. Who's Tina?|Our head cheerleader. She's got rules against this kind|of thing. It's all in the manual. And you've|gotta follow the rules. Well, do you see Tina|anywhere around here? No. Sorry. Are you okay? Are we allowed|to be in here? 2:00 a.m.'s|the only good time to swim. The rest of the time,|I'm working. Where? Well, I do work-study|in the cafeteria. Part-time in an audio store.|Full-time as a student. And the rest of the time|as a mix-master. What's a mix-master?|It's a turn-tablist. What's a turn-tablist?|It's a D.J. I knew that. Oh, hey. I'm not into you|like that. L... No, I didn't... I... Well, then I'm leaving.|I'm out. Okay. Fine. Fine. It's over.|Okay. Well, okay... Why do you work so much?|I work so much... because my dad wouldn't pay my|tuition unless I declared premed. And you didn't want to be|a doctor, so... So, I work. Well, you know what they say|about men who work too hard. They become|tired, boring... and in the process they lose|all their spontaneity. Derek, are you tired? No. You're boring! You are boring. Boring, my ass! Whoo! God, you look great|under water. Well, did I tell you|I'm a cheerleader? Yeah.|I think we covered that. Did we talk about|your 10,000 part-time jobs? Yeah.|I think a while back. Oh. Well, was there anything else|that we needed to cover? Well, there was... one thing I wanted to... I gotta go.|Wait, wait, wait. Don't you|want to stay and, you know, swim|a little more? I think my roommate might be|getting worried about me. Why would she be worried? Because, you're turning me|into a criminal. Whit... Whittier, I could get|hypothermia without you here! And five, six, seven, eight! One, two, three, four,|five, six, seven, eight! One! Girls, put your hands on your hips. Suzy, how about suckin'|in the arm flab? Thank you. Claire, sweetie, two|eyebrows are better than one. Think I gave you the memo.|Oh, my God.! Monica.! Time for some damage|control on that ass! For a minute there, I thought I was looking|at a Hefty Bag full of chili dogs! Ha! Greg.! How about|the happy cheer face now, huh? This is my happy cheer face. That's not|a happy smile! That's a hate smile. Is it that obvious, bitch?|All right. Pop-off on two. One, two and... down. Five, six, seven, eight.! One, two, three, four,|five, six, seven, again.! One, two, three, four,|five, six, seven, again! One, two, three, four... You suck|so much, I can't stand you! Again! Go.! Faster, faster,|faster, faster, faster.! Come on, you Sasquatch.!|Let's go.! Come on, Monica.! Show me a herkie.!|Let's see it.! Let's see it.! What is that? Push.|Push! This weight is a car, and it is pressed|on top of your mother! Lift it off your mom! Lift it off her!|Lift it off her! Too late. She's dead. What is this, a bowl ofJell-O|I'm looking at? Whit, that water is not|from the French Alps! Down for 10... And six|and seven and eight! You guys are looking|so great today. I'm just kidding.|You look like crap. All right, Monica and Whittier,|get ready for a pop-off on four. Hey, you wanna do a cradle|off the back? You want to? Yeah. Ready?|One, two, three, four. What the hell was that? I asked for a simple pop-off!|Was that a simple pop-off? I'm very curious|to know, Monica. Was that or was that not|a pop-off? Settle down, Tina. We were giving|the routine a little flavor, a little individuality. A little flavor?|A little individuality? Missy, you are no longer|an individual. All right? You are a very|small, little minute part... of a very big-ass machine! And that machine has my|name on it. You got it? - We're sorry.|- Not good enough, Whittier. Meet me|in my office... 0800. Is that the address? She's waiting for you.|Come on, this way. Tina, I'm really sorry about|what happened in practice. Shut the door. Did you know that, um, - George W. Bush was a cheerleader in college?|- Actually, I did. Ronald Reagan was also a cheerleader.|So was Dwight D. Eisenhower. The three greatest presidents|of the last 200 years... - all cheerleaders.|- Was Ronald Reagan really one of the top three? Top 40.|My point is this. From great cheerleaders|come even greater leaders. You may be a great cheerleader,|Whittier, but you are not a great leader. I know,|and I'm really trying hard. See these portraits|on the wall? A 98-year tradition of|cheerleading excellence at CSC. Starting back with the remarkable|Margaret Whiting in 1938. What's she doing?|An arabesque. You can't tell|under the hoopskirt. All the way up to the fantastic|Hammersmith dynasty of today. These are your sisters?|Yep. They're all part of a grand|legacy with no end in sight. That last empty frame|right there is reserved... for the head cheerleader|who will take our place... our next leader.|Marni. It could be Marni. Or it could be Greg.|Whoo. Or as I've been|thinking lately, - it could be you.|- Yeah, right. - I'm serious, Whittier.|- But I completely messed up in practice. I thought you called me in here|to kick me off the team. Oh, I haven't|totally ruled that out yet. I don't know. I just expect|more out of you than the others. Certainly more than|your friend, Monica. Monica was just messing around. Wait|till game day. She'll be perfect. Oh, really? She's gonna be great on|game day? Monica is a sinking ship! To be a great cheerleader|you have to make sacrifices. And I suggest|you start with her. Do you mean|not being friends with her? 'Cause we're roommates.|Listen, sweetie. Being head cheerleader... is a privilege you should|very much want. I mean, Students have posters|of me on their walls. They pay hundreds of dollars... 320 to be exact...|just to get my number. They raffle off the right|to carry my books to class. It's so silly. Foreign exchange students|literally... beg to do my homework...|straight A's. All this could be yours. You could be|the greatest thing on this campus... the next me. - Whoa.|- But I don't know. It's all a question|of how bad you really want it. I mean, for starters, you're gonna have|to shine at the home opener this weekend. Literally millions|will be watching you. But most importantly,|I will be watching you. I'm tired now. Handing out all those towels has|made my arms feel like soggyJell-O. I'm too tired to point out|how dumb that sounds. Hey, guys. Hey, Britney Spaz.|Why are you so happy? Didn't Tina just rip you|a new... I can't say what. Actually... and, ladies,|please keep this a secret, Tina told me that|if I work really hard... and I play my cards right, I could become|head cheerleader. - Congratulations, Whittier!|- Yeah, that's great! You're not bummed are you? No. I|don't want to be head cheerleader. I'm just flossin' my moves until I make|it as a dancer on J. Lo's next tour. I've been meaning to talk|to you about that. What? Tina made a lot of sense|in practice the other day. There is a big difference between|individual dance moves and... Oh, my gosh! What? There's over 680 calories in that. Not|to mention 35 grams of saturated fat. That must've been a real special|talk you had with Tina back there. Too bad yourJedi mind tricks couldn't|fend off the dark side of the force. Monica, if you want to be|the bomb diggity, you have got to act|like the bomb diggity, and Tina is the bomb diggity! Did she just say, "bomb diggity"|three times in one sentence? Your halftime score is|Stingers, 17. Willowcrest, nine. No, I'm serious. We're the ones|with all the pressure. Pressure? No, girly, you don't|know what real pressure is! You see, I got to|go out there first. Just me. Solo. And if these 50,000 people|don't buy into the whole illusion... of who I am|and what I represent, you guys are toast! Aren't you just a big bug?|Correction! I am a hunting wasp... of the order hymenoptera, with|a deadly venomous ovipositor! Do you know what that is?|Well, I'll tell ya! It's a deadly|stinger, bitch! Bug! Stay in the zone, Sammy.|You stay in the zone. Chest out! Ponytail, no. Up-do, yes. Sweetie, no double earrings. You're a|State cheerleader, not a State hooker. Go, go, go, Stingers Go-go, go-go-go|Uh-oh, the Stingers Remember, Whit.|Head cheerleader. What do you mean|"head cheerleader"? I'm the next head cheerleader. I am! Focus on the performance. I am|not gonna focus on the performance! Focus! No, I'm not gonna focus! I won't! I don't mean that. Please don't|hate me! Tina, please don't hate me! Hey, I don't hate you, Marni. Shut up! Sammy Here comes Sammy |Ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to turn your|attention to the multi-champion... Show time. Stinger cheerleaders and|their "Stingtacular"halftime show.! Yeah!|Come on! Let's go! Let's get it on, Stingers!|Number one! Number one! Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen,|say hello to Sammy Stinger... and your Stinger cheerleaders.! Let's go, Stingers!|Whoa! Hit it.! Let's go, Stingers! Stingers! Let's go, Stingers! - Let's go, Stingers!|Ohh! Ho-ho! Go back! Go back!|Let's see it again! Go, Stingers! - One more time.|One more time. Tina, she's here. Hey, baby.|Way to go, Whittier.! Hey, Whittier.! Hi.|Whittier, right? Jackson. Senior, with|the Boxster out front? I was wondering if... We just|saw the video, and we were like, "That is the shizzle,"|and we... Okay, okay, okay. You two, hands off. This|is my party, my cheerleader. So, great facial|on TV today. Sticking your tongue out on|camera, totally inspired. You think? O.M. G, it was T.D.F., F.Y.I. Whittier, this is Todd.|Starting wide receiver, 6'1 ", 3.2 G.P.A.,|runs a 4.6 forty. 4.5 forty. How ya doin'?|Uh, good. And it just doesn't happen. He said|he was a good listener. Hi, Marni. Would you like an appetizer?|But he wasn't a good listener. Here.|How about a towel? I'm sorry! Sorry. Would you|like an appetizer? This is why I go to the trouble|ofhosting all these parties. So guys like you can|mingle with girls like you. So mingle.|Blaine! Eh, really nice|touchdown catch today. Homeboy didn't want to play|the rest of the game. Got taken off on a stretcher. The|quarterback's all staring at me. I'm like, "Oh, boy, I'm gonna hit you so|hard, your mama's gonna feel it!" Right? We broke from the huddle... Hi,|Whittier. Would you like an appetizer? I'm okay. Thank you. How about a towel? Then they motioned into a slot.|That's when I knew the running back... was gonna do an up-and-under|pattern behind the linebacker. And he's... You know,|that's... great, really. Do you mind|if for the next minute... we talk about something|other than football? Uh, I'm sorry.|It's my bad. I'm sorry. Thanks. So, Tina, um, tells me you're a "C" cup. Oh, dude, check out the|brunette. Sweet! Yeah, she's hot. She was not gonna be|head cheerleader. And... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Check out|the blond right over there. Where? Where?|The dude right over there. What do you mean,|"dude"? Hey, you know what? The|one with the great legs.! I bet he could|leg-press a mule. Oh, man!|What? Oh, you... You didn't know? Listen. I got nothin' against|your kind of people. It's just football rules. I gotta kick|your ass now. That sounds like a party. You should know, though,|I bench-press 220. Whatever, dude.|235. Can we talk? Now? Thank you. Pardon us. Yo! Dewey! Okay, let's blow|this joint. Mon, Mon, Mon. Don't go yet. Whit! We cheered on national television.|This is our coming-out party. Blue! Hey, excuse me. Uh, I'm looking|for a girl named Whittier. She's about yea tall. She's|blond, super-cute. Well, look who it is,|smart guy. Why don't you say|something smart, smart guy? Yeah, okay. How about something|foreign and exotic like adios. Hey, don't.|Chill, big guy.! God! Besides, there are some good people here|too, and they're here to celebrate us! Yeah, they want|to celebrate all over us. Derek! Hey, Monica.|Hi, hottie. I didn't think you were|gonna make it. Yeah. How'd you get past the goon squad?|Guile, cunning, cowardice. You, scruffy boy. Out. This party is|exclusivo. No, it's okay. - He's with me. We're together.|- Who's he? This is Derek.|He's a D.J. There are, like, 10,000 hot|varsity football players inside, and you're snuggling up|to a D.J.? - How edgy.|- What's wrong with a D.J.? Honey, oh. There's a logical|order to the college universe, and the sooner|you learn it, the better. See, way up here at the top of|the ladder are football players. Right. They rule.|Just underneath them... are basketball players... smaller|biceps but still desirable. Then, soccer hunks,|lacrosse studs, fraternity presidents...|ohh... fraternity keg-masters, guys with cars with parking passes,|guys with cars without parking passes... kind of a waste of time...|Love your dress, Tina.! Black Student Union activists...|Hey!... Bruce Lee fan clubbers, lit-mag squares, pep-band|dorks, um, film society toads, campus ministers,|school mascots... and then, God,|all the way at the bottom... are campus D.J.'s. One spot above cafeteria workers.|Actually, I work at the cafeteria too. Oh, do you? Tsk.|That's hopeless. Listen, Whit. Remember our|little "discush" the other day? You have to decide,|are you with us... or are you with him? I'm sorry. Derek, I... Oh, I get it.|Yeah. - Oops.|- But... I'll call you.! I can't believe|you just did that! Oh, she did the right thing.|She stuck with the winners. Excuse me? You think you're a winner|because you got a bunch of idiots... up your bomb diggity butt? Excuse me? Whittier! - Are you coming?|- Yeah. What are you looking at? What's her problem?|Drama queen. So Doc says if I sprain my hip-flexor one|more time, I can kiss my herkie good-bye. Hey, you guys. Hey. - Greg, can you help me stretch my hamstrings?|- Yeah. - Look, about the party...|- On your feet. Practice|has started. Today we're gonna|work on manners and respect. Because some of you don't know|how to behave at a team function. Some of you don't show proper|manners to a head cheerleader. Some of you don't show respect to|the concept of team unity. Come on. Oh, good!|Monica. We'll start with you. Here we go.|What do you got? Front handspring round-off,|back handspring toe touch. Stop the music! Is that all you got? And again! Round-off back handspring,|back tuck. Music stop! And again! Herkie! Herkie! Herkie! Herkie! Herkie! Herkie!|Herkie! Herkie! Herkie! Herkie! Herkie! - Herkie! Herkie! Herkie!|No one touch her! I'm not done yet, Monica!|To be a real cheerleader... - Tina, give it a rest.|- Not now, Greg! I said give it a rest! Okay. All right. You're right. I should... I|should... I should give it a rest. - Whittier, call out the steps.|- What, me? You heard me.|That's what leaders do. - But Monica...|- Call out the steps. - Call them out!|- No! Listen, freshman. I put you in that|uniform, and I can take you right out of it! Call the steps,|or you're off the team. Then I'm off the team.|Wh-What? You heard me. I quit! I quit too. That's right.|I quit too. - Greg, you'll lose your cheerleading scholarship.|- That's right! I'm stayin' here, but under a cloud of shame. Tina. You can have this back because|it's supposed to show team spirit. It's supposed|to make us feel proud, but I just feel|guilty and stupid! So you can have your skirt|and your spankies and your top. I'm out of here! I need this to get home. I'll|bring it back when it's dry-cleaned. Bye, Miss Bomb Diggity. She'll be back. She's not coming back! It's only Whittier. - Ice cream... Super Fudge Chunk.|- No! Ice cream! All right!|Stupid. Hey.|Hey. Run.! Run.! All right, take home.!|Take home.! - Our team sucks!|- Whittier, quit worrying about the game... and enjoy the sunshine. - The sun sucks.|- Whittier, don't you know that the sun... is nature's Prozac? Do you really think|the sun is gonna make me feel better... about giving up the most|important thing in my life? No, but I'm out of real Prozac,|so you're gonna have to deal. I ruined my career|as a cheerleader. I ruined my relationship with|Derek. I could've had a boyfriend. I ruined my entire life! Yeah, I feel better. - Anyone want to hit the library?|- Ooh, I'll go with. This place is starting|to weird me out anyway. Women's softball...|I just don't get it. Whittier... - It'll be okay.|- I know. Thank you. You'll be fine, girl! - Trust me.|- Come on. Let's go, Stingers. - Nicejob.|Nice way to take the base. Batter up.! Come on, y'all.|Let's hear it. We got Stinger spirit. Come on, y'all.|Let's hear it. We got Stinger spirit. Come on, y'all.|Let's hear it! We got Stinger spirit. Come on, y'all.|Let's hear it. We got Stinger spirit. Come on, y'all.|Let's hear it. We got Stinger spirit. Come on, y'all. Let's hear|it. We got Stinger spirit. Come on, y'all.|Let's hear it! We got Stinger spirit! Come on, y'all.|Let's hear it! - What's going on?|- We got Stinger spirit! Come on, y'all. Let's hear it. We got Stinger spirit. Come|on, y'all. Let's hear it! We got Stinger spirit! Come on, y'all.|Let's hear it. We got Stinger spirit! Come|on, y'all. Let's hear it. We got Stinger spirit. Come|on, y'all. Let's hear it. We got Stinger spirit.! Yeah. Yes! Number one! Number one! Let's go, Stingers!|Let's go! Those are my girls!|Go, Stingers! Whoa.! Whoa.! Monica! I got it!|You got... You got what? We're|gonna start our own squad. Oh, shut up.|No, no. I'm serious. Our own squad.|New and improved. Shut up! No. For real!|Come on! Let's go! Are you sure you put the|audition time on the flyer? Yes. Okay, because it was|an hour and a half ago. I put the time on there. Okay. Well, what color|paper did you use? I already told you.|Lemon yellow. You should have used|wild berry pink. Wild berry pink always|gets people to show up. Why are you all|up in my grille? Do you see me asking what color|markers you used for the big signs? Black and gold.|With glitter? No. Whit, what is a|sign without glitter? That is why nobody showed up! Shh. Shh. Do you hear that? Someone's coming. You ladies ready|for my dope? I don't know what that was. Our|new-and-improved squad lasted exactly 97 minutes. Don't give up yet. I mean,|maybe we'll find some talent. Where? All the cheerleaders on|campus are already cheerleaders. Then I don't know. It's not like we're|gonna run into a group of people... just spontaneously|shouting out... cheers. Yes.!|What do we want? Justice.! When do we want it?|Now! And how will we get it? By standing outside|the dean's office... Sorry, what? I have no|idea what you just said. Who in the hell|are these people? It's the extracurricular|groups... the ones that lost their practice space|when the dean took away their funding. Justice.!|Man, they got jacked. And how will we get it? By standing outside|the dean's office... You guys suck. First of all, I want to thank you guys|all for coming here today to this... What's the word|I'm looking for? Hi. Shit-hole?|Thanks. It's the only place that we|could find to meet. So, anyway... - Today we're starting a new|cheerleading club on campus. Why cheerleading, you say?|Because cheerleading is fun. And it fosters|school spirit. And it also keeps you...|physically fit. So, what do you guys say?|Are you ready to cheer? Yeah! Yes? Most of my pieces|involve anguish... as a theme. Do you have any cheers|about anguish? Yeah.|Yeah. Well, we have one that|goes like this. Ready? Okay! That's all right!|That's okay! So that one kind of addresses|the issue of anguish... kind of. But other than that,|not really. What about soliloquies? - Well, we don't really have-|- And what about accents? Because I am the master... of accents. No. See, what we do|is cheerleading. - Then I'm out.|- Me too. No, no, no.|Hold on because... Hold on for one second.|Wait, you guys. Something Whittier forgot|- Hey. Wait. Something Whittier|forgot to tell you all is... if we're good,|we can go to nationals. Now, if we go to nationals,|we could win. If we win,|we get a check for $20,000. Now, Penelope,|you could use that money... to rent rehearsal space. And, Francis, you could mount up a production|of Godspell where everyone has a French accent. Interesting. Plus, we're gonna be|a real squad too. On our squad,you're gonna be able to do whatever you want|- do your own thing. And if we're good, we can stamp out the|varsity cheerleading squad once and for all. - Where do we sign up?|- Right over there. Oh, yeah. I've been saving you since cheerleader|camp. You did not have to save me. I think the score is now Whittier,|zero. Monica, three. Thanks. Come on, silly. This is so "ridic." Do they actually|think they're a real cheer squad now? They're real cheerleaders in the same|way that Joan Rivers has a real face. We have to crush them. We have to take their heads|and grind them into the mud... and then stomp on their backs and then|drive over them with a Jeep Cherokee S.U.V. Marni, geez. Take a pill|of the chill variety, okay? We don't need|to do anything. We cannot have a competing|spirit squad on campus, Tina. Trust me, they won't be a threat to us. They're nothing but a support|group for rejects and losers. Besides... How 'bout|that practice space? And right, left, clap. Right, clap. Left,|clap. Come on, you guys. Step left. Step right. A|little bit tighter, Penelope. Little bit tighter.|Stand back, woman. I need at least a three to|five-foot radius- Oh, my... - Roll. Roll. Follow me. Good. Now try three claps|into a high "V." - Okay, guys. And five,|six, seven, eight. Grab one, two- Down- Three,|four- Up- Five, six. Good. Okay, stand up now. Good.|Stand up. Yeah. Can you guys just turn|around? Yeah. Face us. Hold your stomach.|Squeeze your butt. - Don't look down. No, no, no.|- Good. Good. Great. Catch me! Okay. This is|a basic pyramid. Matthew, you'll take the|wing position here. Yeah. - Got it.|- Penelope,you're gonna swing around here... and start|your stunt there, okay? I can't be an "O." You can't be an "O"? O's represent emptiness. And by making me an "O, "|you're calling me empty. That's insane. Okay? Uh, O's don't|represent emptiness. They represent hugs.|And X's are kisses. Everyone knows that. Up. Up. Lock your legs. Good. Yes! Tighter. Double base extension. Ready?|Five, six, seven, eight. One, two and three, four. Up. Goodjob. Bring in the legs.|Okay. You got it. Don't look down. Don't look down.|No, no, no, no. Hey. You know,|I think I... What's up, girl?|So what's going on? What?|I said, "What's going-" Sorry. What? What's going on? Oh, not much.|How 'bout you? Well, we have this new|cheerleading squad. Yeah. So I heard.|And we're improving. We're just|missing something. We don't have any rhythm. You know, no|backbeat to help us bring it all together. But if we had a great D.J.... Look, I got three jobs, this radio|gig, two advanced lit classes... I know it would mean|a lot to Whittier. Look, she feels really bad|about what happened. - She's looking for a way|to reconnect with you. Hold on. I gotta intro|this next tune. That, my friends, was the|bitchin' sound ofThe Promise Ring. This next track is dedicated to all the guys|out there whose hearts have been ripped out... and devoured for breakfast by cute,|peppy, social-climbing blond girls. Give me a "Hey." Give me a "Ho."|Give me a "I don't know you anymore." I know it sucks. What was your question? Forget it. Dear Lord, help us kick almighty ass|today in our debut as a spirit squad. Help us to perform the double back|handspring into a back tuck as majestically... as your only son|Jesus would. This is a big sporting|event for us. Guide us in leading this|team to victory. Bring it in. - One, two, three!|Renegades! Come on. Croquet. Croquet.! Yes.! Come on! Croquet!|Let's go! Let's go, croquet.!|That's right.! Yeah. Come on, cricket.! Ready? Okay!|Okay! That's all right.|It's croquet. We're gonna... - Come on! Come on!|Yeah! Let's go! Yeah! Croquet!|Number one! Let's go, croquet.!|Let's go.! That's right, croquet.!|Let's go.! Whoo.! Yeah.!|Let's do it. All right. Let's go, croquet.! Let's go! Hit that ball.! Hit that ball.! Take that ball and hit it.|What I say? Now whack it. Yeah, now that's the ticket.|Yeah, that's the ticket. Croquet! Come on! Is, uh, all this noise|bothering you, pal? The noise I can take. It's the suckiness|that bothers me. Let's hit it! Five, six, seven, eight. Tell me what we need|Stinger pride Stinger pride Tell me what we breathe|Stinger pride Stinger pride Tell me what we bleed|Stinger pride Stinger pride Tell me what we need|Stinger pride Stinger pride Tell me what we breathe|Stinger pride Stinger pride Tell me what you see|Stinger pride Stinger pride Tell me what we need|Stinger pride Stinger pride Hell, yeah! Stinger pride|Stinger pride Cola beverage- diet. Wipe the spittle. They look foolish. I mean,|really. What do they have? They have enthusiasm.|So do we! And they have the love|of the crowd. Do we? Don't even think|that thought. I'm just saying.|And I'm just saying... a person goes against his team, and he|could lose his cheerleading scholarship. Let's go.|We've got work to do. Now, Greg.! That herkie into a cupie just before|we spread the rubber with it... That was almost as moving as the|helicopter landing in Miss Saigon. Yeah. I|- I know. For a moment there, at the end, Yeah! when we won,|I experienced an emotion... that I can only describe|as moderate happiness. How did you know|where we were gonna be? You told him? Whittier, zero.|Monica, four. - Thanks.|- Your, uh, squad... is gonna have a real|tough time winning nationals... when, technically speaking,|you don't exist. Look around.|I'd say we exist. Who are you? Shh|- It's called a razor, scruffy boy. You don't exist according to a|little thing called Section Eight... of the National Collegiate|Cheer Association Bylaws. Yeah. It states that, um,|each university... shall be represented|by one-and only one... O- N-E-|cheer squad. - You can't do this to us.|- So make like a Tom and cruise. This is modern-day|imperialism. Boo freaking hoo. Uh, you missed something,|sweetie. It does say that only one team|from State can go to nationals. S. But it doesn't say which team. That team could be us. Even if all that is true,|it doesn't matter. - Mm-hmm. - Varsity has been|going to nationals forever. That is not gonna change. It just might. Looks like we're at|an impasse. So how 'bout you and I just|figure this out right now. Where did you get that?|That does not belong to you. Ladies, we are not going to|settle things this way. There's only one honest, impartial person|on this campus who can judge who's right. And while I admire your spunk, Miss|Smith, this is a school built on tradition. - But- - And in this case|tradition favors Miss Hammersmith. I must say, Whittier, there's a lot of good,|honest wisdom behind what the dean has to say. - Thank you.|- You're welcome. Sure. But what about the rules? Nowhere|in the bylaws does it say... that it has to be the varsity|team that goes to nationals. - Why can't it be us?|- Well, sure. Legally, technically... if you... squint your eyes just right|- the rules say it could be you. But we're talking about seven consecutive|years of cheerleading excellence here. I'm not gonna|put an end to that. Miss Hammersmith|will go to nationals. With all due respect,|Dean Sebastian, I don't think that's a decision that|will go over well with the student body. - How do you mean?|- I mean, if you suppress our voices on campus, you will be hearing from us in|letters to the board of trustees... not to mention the around-the-clock|protestors that will be outside your door. Okay, okay, okay. We get it.|What the hell do you want? A competition in front of|the whole student body. Let them decide who's better,|your team or mine. - Girl on girl.|- Hmm. Winner goes to nationals. Listen, Whit. We're good friends, right? And as a good friend, I should|caution you that such a competition... could embarrass you severely. It could destroy your|already-fragile psyche. Well, that's a risk|I'm willing to take, Tina. She can't do this, can she? Actually, Miss Hammersmith,|I think it's a splendid idea. - We'll have a competition.|- What? - Thank you.|- We'll have a competition in the field house... this coming Saturday.|What? Wait. That's the day|after tomorrow. - If you'll excuse me, ladies, I have a lunch date.|- We can't be ready by then. We'll be ready.|- Yes, you will. This can't be happening.|Oh, yes, it can. You're the one who asked for|the competition. Good day. Ready to back out yet? Are you kidding me?|After the way you treated us? You know I used to look up to you? But|that was before I found out who you are. An insecure "tanorexic." Listen to me, you hobbit. After this idiotic|competition is over, you'll be praying|you were me. You'll be finished as a|cheerleader and finished here. I will knock you so far down|you'll be in the cafeteria... with your edgy, freak of a boyfriend,|putting grapes in theJell-O molds. Oh, yeah?|Mm-hmm. Don't be all up|in my Kool-Aid. What does that mean? The Stingers hoops team won their|first exhibition contest 72-54. And the women's softball squad|dropped both games... of a doubleheader against|State A&M. And now it's time for|the CSC News Eye On Sports. On location is beat reporter|Colleen Lipman. Thanks, Colleen. The campus is|in a frenzy this week, thanks to the big cheerleading showdown|in the field house this Saturday. Go, go, go, go.|Come on, you sissy! The varsity cheer team has been|vigorously training for the event. I'm totally not tired.|Why are y'all so tired? And State cheerleading legend, Tina Hammersmith,|is confident about her team's chances. This is nothing new to us. We've|defeated some of the best... intercollegiate competition|ever assembled. This amateur squad|is just a speed bump... on the way to nationals. Excusez-moi. One sec. Let's go!|I didn't say stop. How important is victory|on Saturday? Oh. It's very important.|It's very important. It- It's very important.|This is very, very... I- I cannot tell you|how important this is. It's a- It's pretty-|pretty important. Meanwhile, some people|around campus... are starting to dub the upstart|competition as... the Renegades. Head cheerleader,|Whittier Smith, insists her squad is ready|to go. We are definitely going to win. We've got a great team, we've worked|extremely hard and it's gonna be tough, but, you know, Rocky beat|Apollo Creed, right? Uh, Whit, he lost.|He what? He lost.|He lost to Apollo Creed? To train for the event, the Renegades|have taken an unusual approach, cheering for typically under-appreciated|teams such as the diving team, the bowling club|and the fencing squad. Stab him. Stab him.|Poke him in the eye. Run the sword through|till his blood runs dry. En garde.! Well, some people look at an|impossible situation and ask why. Others look at the same|situation and ask, why not? For the competition|on Saturday, I'm asking myself why. Why bother? In a billion years we'll all|be obliterated by a black hole anyway. There you have it, Colleen.|Back to you. Thanks, Colleen. Seven, eight. One, two, three,|four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four,|five, six, seven, eight. Yeah.!|Shh, shh, shh. You guys, we can't let anybody know|we're in here. Really, really good job. Don't leave any of|your stuff. All right. Think we're ready? Well, no one fell tonight.|I'm pretty happy about that. Um, Whittier,|can I talk to you alone? Yeah. Francis, what's up? Uh, I'm gonna level with you. I'm getting very nervous|about tomorrow. Okay? And I'm thinking about|violating myself tonight. It's an actor relaxation|technique. What I need to know from you is|what does Whittier think? Is that a bad idea, or... Well, it really depends. Uh, would you say violating yourself|usually hurts you or helps you? Oh, I'd say it's made me|the actor that I am today. Okay. Then I would say|hold off. Will do, chief.|Okay. Well, well, well. If it isn't|the blond leading the bland. Last minute cram session,|kiddie kiddos? Why don't you guys worry about your own|team? That's what a real leader would do. Oh. Is that what|a real leader would do? A real leader wouldn't be|practicing at midnight, Whit. You can drill a loser|all night long, and in the morning,|you still got a loser. - Put makeup on a pig-|- It's still a pig. Oink, oink, oink, oink. You wanna hear our cheer|for tomorrow? We're ready, we're fit, we'll|smack you like a little bitch. Oh-ho. We're tough, we're lean,|step to us and we'll get mean. Hey, ho,you know.|We'll put you on the flo' Dust off your spankies.|Stand up and get some mo'. Don't cry, don't pout,|don't have yourself a cow. You're gonna get whupped.|Your mommy can't help you now. - Come on. You can do|better than that. I can do better, bitch.|Let's go. - Come on.|- Marni, chill. Marni.|No. Get back here!|We are not finished with this. Hey, hey!|Ow. Okay. - Watch the face.|- Okay, girls, slap and tickle time|is over. Oh. Ow.! Oh.! Right. There you go. Ow. Ow. Ow. Little, uh, concealer|will help that situation there. Tina! Paging Dr. Stateman. I'm fine, you guys. Yeah? Can you hold me up in the|air with three crushed metacarpals? Of course. Ow! Shit! We should just call|Tina and forfeit. Yeah, you know what. I|don't think we have a choice. I guess tomorrow I'll go back to doing|Phantom of the Opera in my dorm room. Hmm. Wait. Hold up, guys.|Listen. Tomorrow we are gonna go into that field|house and get in front of those students. And as sure as I'm standing here|right now, I can assure you that... that we might suck. We might totally suck,|but to a real cheerleader... it doesn't matter|if you win or lose. It only matters if you|try as hard as you can... if you give it every|ounce of spirit you've got. So, what do you say? Who wants to suck tomorrow? You know what? If there's one|thing I'm good at in this world... it's sucking. - I'm in!|- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Why suck if you could not suck? Because we're missing Francis.|It's gonna be hard. Well, could you guys use a sub? You're gonna lose|your scholarship. Yeah, well, whatever I lose in|financial aid, I'll gain in testicles! So I'm in.! Okay. All right. Come on. Let's go.|Twenty-five, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. More. More! Oh! Oh!|Give me that! Co - Come on How are you feelin'?|I feel like I wanna smile. Good!|Hey! Ow. Ooh. You ready to kick a little? Bring it!
