He touched it... This is great! You'll be fine here. lt's cosy, welcoming, nicely decorated... And your dad's delighted to have you to stay! Three weeks later Awake at last. Look, l've found a good ad for you. They need a science teacher. You can do science, nu? Dad, l studied philosophy. Philosophy, ok! l didn't do physics, science, mathematics... So? Aiob's a iob. You can't stay on the dole here forever. l iust woke. Wait until 10 to bust my balls. lt is 10, you layabout! Put the talisman as close as possible to your son. Under his bed, in his jacket's lining, or in his briefcase. He doesn't have a briefcase, Rebbe. He doesn't even have a iob. Never mind. Just make sure he doesn't find it. Just give it three weeks. He'll find work, he'll meet a nice girl and, above all, he'll move out. May God hear you, Rebbe. But she has to be a nice Jewish girl, Rebbe. Not a shikse like that dancer who dumped him. Of course, Elias ben Moshe, it only works for nice Jewish girls. Coming! Maurice, is that you? You'll be here in two minutes? Yes, stop shouting! l'll check the street. No, l don't see anyone. No one, ok. Not even you, l see. Where are you? l see you now. l see you! Relax, Moishe. You're safe here. No one sawyou come in. Want some tea? Just a drop then. l'm getting those belly pains again. The BeIgian govemment is pressing both sides for a truce in Gaza... A truce now? They're crazy on TV! Those Hamas Nazis want a truce? Why is that thing still round your neck, son? You're better now, aren't you? lt stays until the pain goes. You could keep it on for a year then? Where's the remote? Hundreds of people took shelter here... Dad, turn it down. They thought they would be safe inside a school. But four Israeli rockets Ianded in the compound, injuing 40 peopIe. Hi, Uncle Maurice. Great hiding place. Earlier, in Gaza, another UN gchool wag attacked. Simon, did anyone follow you here when you came up? The street's always empty. So whose black car is that? lt's Mr Hirsh's. And the van next to it? That's the Stasi. They've been waiting for you. Listen here, Simon, don't you make fun of me! l fought in Spain, Simon, and l'm still on their list! So tell me whose van it is! l don't know. There's no one out there, ok! Don't get Uncle's blood pressure up! Listen, Ernest, l'm going now. See? He's leaving because ofyou! You unworthy son! Shit... Well? Looked at those ads? Nothing for me. Move, you're not see-through. And that teaching post? lt's in Liege, in mathematics. Take the train. The train's not so bad. l do a degree in mathematics first? Ty to make an effort. Your cousin Isaac never studied and look at him now. A nice wife, three children and owner of a ''four-sided'' home. - Lucky guy! - Exactly. But my son won't take the train or get up at 7 to go to work. He's too good for mathematics. My son's been to university! Knowwhen l started work? Back then, you did anyiob going and didn't live at home until you were 36! Dad, l've told you a thousand times: this is temporay! - Quiet! l'm not deaf. - You are. Hard of hearing, Professor Berkenbaum said. Doctor Berkenbaum is as deaf as you. Professor, not doctor! You keep the sound up for Berkenbaum and the neighbours? Shut up! Berkenbaum told me not to let you wind me up! lt's you, Corazon. How are you, my dear? How's my grandson? Is school ok too? Yes, he's right here. l'll put him on. Your goy. Don't call her that! Hello, Cori? Just a second, l'll go to another room. Shit! Sory, Corazon, l totally forgot. l was at the hospital and l had to keep my phone off. Don't get mad, l'm going. Schmuli! Schmuli! Dad! Excuse me, but why is he wrapped up when it's so hot here? You should have been here to pick him up an hour ago. We kept calling you. Without your wife, l'd have called the cops. You should have hit him first and given him a cold shower, sadist! Screwyou, sir! You haven't been stuck here an hour! l don't think you get it. Screwyou, you Nazi! Fuck... Are you ok? Are you ok, Dad? Do you need an ambulance? Does it hurt a lot? l'm ok. Sory, l shouldn't have hit you. Yes... l know, not after 8. You told me 100 times. No Coke, no crisps. You think l'm stupid? Of course he'll do his teeth! Come on, Corazon, it only happened once. l have my ticket for your ballet. l'm coming anyway. It's a fucking free county! Ok, Schmuli? Knowwhat we'll do this weekend? We'll do some great stuff. We'll go to McDonald's and to the movies. Mum says l can't drink Coke. We'll have Fanta. Can we buy me a rabbit? Forget the rabbit. Your mum said no. She's stubborn. Please... lt's not fair. Please... Stop it, you're being a pain! l'll ask Karl to buy me a rabbit then. Who's Karl? He sleeps in Mum's bed. Who is this Nazi bastard? l don't know. l think he's in Mum's show. She doesn't waste time! You ok, Dad? What's this Karl like? ls he tall? Good-looking? Tougher than Dad? Yes, he's stronger than Dad. But he's not as funny. Great. He asks about you. He wants to be your friend. Ok, cut it out now. Dad doesn't like Karl and he's heard enough! Grandpa! Schmuli! Look, this is for you, sweetheart. No presents. It's not his birthday, Easter or Christmas. lt's Sukkoth, you goy, in case you forgot. l'm allowed to spoil my only grandson. Know what we're going to do? We'll have a big chocolate sundae. You know my chocolate sundae recipe? Yes, Grandpa, ice cream and tons of chocolate sauce! lt's bad for your cholesterol too. Screw my cholesterol! l've told you 100 times not to smoke in your room! You only smoke on the balcony. You'll asphyxiate us! Don't burn that, you fool! You'll jinx the lot of us. Give me that! What have you done? Thank you, Rebbe. Tell me, do you keep the TV on full blast? And you won't let him smoke? And he still won't leave? No, Rebbe. So piss in the washbasin now. - Out ofthe way! - Shoot, Grandpa! Pass to Fabregas. Fabregas to Deco. Deco to Ronaldinho who heads for the goal. Ronaldinho about to shoot... And he scores! Goal! What do you say to Grandpa? Grandpa scored! Already tired, my son? You know, sport's important for your health. Even at Maidanek, l worked out. Even when it was minus 20 and l hadn't eaten for days, with my lungs full of pus... Stop! l don't want to hear any more! l'm not listening. l'm not interested, ok! Just think, Schmuli... No one wants to hear about what they did to us in Poland. The shame of it! l'll listen to you, Grandpa. You're sweet, my little Schmuli-yngele. Dad, that's disgusting! Use the toilet! lf l want to piss in my kitchen sink, l'll piss in my kitchen sink! Why aren't you asleep? lt's my pills. The leaflet says insomnia, troubles and urticaria. Show me. Where is it? What for? You're a doctor now? Maybe you took mine instead. Stop that. It took me hours to get evemhing sorted. Here are my pills, Mr Doctor! Brilliant doctor, in a surgical collar all his life! Where does it say, ''lnsomnia, sleep troubles and urticaria''? On the leaflet l threw out. - Water costs money! - And the stink of piss? l lost my sense of smell when my nose froze at Maidanek. Enough! You've told me that stoy l think he'll move out now. l gave half of my bread to Dan Salesmann because he was thinner than me. A real skeleton. And that was when Kapo Michal... You remember him, the fat Polack slob? He came into our hut and saw Salesmann eating bread. He shouted so loud! What did fat Kapo Michal do? He hit him with his stick, hit him over and over, so hard that the stick broke in two. After, Salesmann walked hunched up like an old mole. - An old mole skeleton? - Yes. Remember my pal Salesmann? l hid with him in the caca pit when the Germans fled the Russians. We stank of caca for two weeks after that! That saved me from Auschwitz. Enough, you old madman! After me, you have to subject him to this? l'm doing no harm! He has to knowthe truth, doesn't he? That damn non-Jewish school won't teach him about the camps! He's only six! Stop talking about the camps and the Germans! lt drove your son crazy and killed your wife! Watch your mouth, you unworthy son! Cancer killed your mother. Not all that! And what caused the cancer? l want the end ofthe stoy about fat Kapo Michal. l want the end ofthe stoy about fat Kapo Michal. Sory, Dad. l didn't mean to hurt you. But he's my son. l have a right to decide what's good for him or not. lfyou need to talk, you can see a shrink. What? Some charlatan who only studied four years and costs more than a specialist? Never! l'm not made of money! You have to be meshuge to see someone like that. Ask Dr Berkenbaum about it then. Hello. Hello, doctor. How's it going on the BX? Well, insomnia... Damn! And itchy arms and ankles. Shouldn't that have cleared up? We'll cut back on the dosage. Don't keep that collar on too long. lt will make your neck rigid. Didn't you have it last month? l'm still in a bit of pain. Tell me, is it possible for my father to be on these pills? Why? We have similar pills with similar side effects. Maybe he took yours by mistake. No way. You don't know my father. He's total maniac about his pills. lt's not possible. The BX isn't on sale yet. Not for a year after the tests end. What are your father's pills? There's no name. His sister buys them over in Florida. Could you check if it's on sale there? l could bring one for you to analyse. Yes, ifyou want. Sign here. Mr Konianski are you busy next week? l told you l was quitting. How much? A painkiller, few side effects. Ok, l'll quit after that. For good! How about this one? ''Seeking young man or woman to represent service company.'' That's my margarine for my cholesterol! Use real butter. l'm fighting cholesterol too. l have your flat feet, l could turn senile too... l don't want cholesterol. Know what my margarine costs? No, l don't know what it costs. But my heart's weak so l'm eating it. Two and a halftimes the price of butter it costs! You're worse than any caricature of a stingy old Kike. You don't say Kike, you shmok! Nazis and Polacks say Kike. Not my son! Cut it out. You talk about Schwane... PoIak, Boshe, Goy... Gevalt... Mala, l can't take it. Simon's driving me mad. He's driving me mad. Can't you adopt this shmendriM Listen to this... You hear him? Maurice? What's up? Nice suit. Who died? Simon, where were you? We've been waiting ages. Look at the way you're dressed! What were you up to, shmendriM Hold on... Simon! You promised to be back by 7. We nearly stopped waiting for you. Where were you? At a peep show, Auntie. Simon, do you know Sonia? My granddaughter. She's a pianist, a great pianist. You like the piano? No, Mrs Hirschfeld. l prefer the bagpipes. Your hair's lovely. l'm not talking about my hair. l'm talking about Sonia. She's given concerts all over the world. Even as a soloist. ln Moscow, Bratislava, London, Jerusalem... You know, Sonia, Simon is an artist too. He loves to draw. You like to drawtoo. Don't you? Simon, apparently you and Sonia were together in the same youth club. That's incredible! Yes, incredible. So incredible l don't remember. What do you play? Rachmaninov mostly. But l like Scriabin and Janacek too. lnteresting. And what about the situation in Gaza? ln Gaza? What situation in Gaza? The blockade, the power and gas cuts, the air raids, civilians murdered... Do you condone it? Stop talking nonsense! Do you think we should boycott Israel until it respects UN resolutions? The people who boycott Israel are killers, anti-Semites and Nazis! You can't blame the Nazis for once! You want to do the Arabs' work? We have a right to that land. We were there first! We're ready to give them a bit of it but they want it all! Look where university gets you. Those terrorists in the Hezbollah, in Gaza, in Ramallah... Who do you mean? The Palestinians? They don't even care about you! Just go and live with the Arabs... Gaza and 30% ofthe West Bank? Great offer! The Palestinians need a homeland like any other people. Ifthey don't get it a new Saladin will rise up... Those terrorists launch the attacks! Listen, shmendrik, if Israel were to disappear with its A-bomb and ifthe Nazis came back, you'd act a lot less proud then, you pro-Palestinian! - Cut it out, Maurice! - Who said that? Colonization engenders terrorism, not the opposite! l'll find myself a nice little Palestinian girl and shag her! l'll shag her! Allah wakhbar!. No way! Why don't theyiust strip completely? Give me a break! - My sister has lovely knockers. - Pervert! No, it sucks. l hated it. It's totally useless. Was the nude part planned? lt's pathetic. How could you agree to do it? l mean, it does nothing for the show. l loved it! Belt up, you pervert! They pay you more to get your tits out? What's wrong? You're not on stage. But anyierk can ogle my son's mother's tits! l found it poetic and original. Too bad you kept your panties. Shut the hell up, Jorge! The headmistress wants to see us. Your son has a bad influence on the other kids. They play Nazis and Jews at break. At least they're acting out. l hope the headmistress will find that funny too. Maybe she can ''act out'' too. You see her. l'm not seeing that cow. She hasn't even read Dolto. lt's youriob. Nazis and Kapos are your dad's stories. You see to it. Even if she hasn't read Dolto! When will you grow up? Karl, a friend. You don't know Karl? He's really cool. A law degree, a swimming champ and he skates like a god. Yeah? Wild. l'll leave you to it. For you... The Bamboo Whistle. The Chinese Barrow. Sucking the Mango. Felacin. Coitus of a Cow. Coito de un toro. Shit! Pia Colada. Caipirinha. Tudo bom. Weaving a Creeper... All right, Mr Konianski? Sory, doctor, l dozed off. l have insomnia because ofthese damn tests. My heart's broken too, but it's not your crap pills. We've had other complaints. We'll probably halt the tests. Are my father's pills, BX 012, on sale in America? Yes. The molecule is already being used experimentally in the USA. What does experimentally mean? Doctors can prescribe it in certain conditions. To treat what? To treat rare lung conditions. As a last resort. Has your father... ever suffered from the cold? l'm sory, Mr Konianski. We don't want to make Gaza a gatellite of lran. Most weapons in Gaza come from lran. Humanitaian groups can't woh foriust three houn a day. The inhabitantg are temfied. to meet the most urgent needs. Dad... You should be in bed. Simon, you unworthy son! Did you call Mrs Hirschfeld's granddaughter to apologize for the other evening? l was ashamed ofyou. For you my son. Keep this in yourwaIIet and you'II succeed. We thought you'd need company. Hello, Mala. Hello, Maurice. l'm sory your brother passed away. My condolences. Hadrien, say hello. l don't want them. l want Grandpa and his pistol. lll-mannered little boy... Let's get an ice cream together. It's wiser. - Fancy one? - Yes! What about us? Let's go. Where's Grandpa? lt's good being together. lt makes you wonder why Mum left Dad. What's so great about her Brazilian faiy? He's mad! Help, Hadrien! Psychopath! Help, Hadrien! Stop it! Ostrof? Why Ostrof? Ostrow. Ostrow. Where is this dump? ln Ukraine, He wants to be buried among those anti-Semites? We were born there. And his first wife died there too. What? What first wife? She died young. We won't talk about it now. Dad had a first wife? How come l don't know? Did they have kids? l iust asked you something. No, they didn't have kids. We can't talk about it now. Sammy is a busy man. Who was she? What was her name? Sarah. Why be buried with her? How should l know? Your father was always a bit odd. How come no one told me? Shut up, Simon! We'll tell you some other time. ln Ukraine... Getting a body all that way isn't easy. We'll need an air ambulance. Danny? Rebenski here. What have we got for Kiev? El Al... No, not Lufthansa. Air Austria... And Lot? That much? Thanks, Danny. lt's not cheap. You'll need an ambulance for at least two days with the roads there, the customs papers, of course. The burial plot... The taxes, you can't avoid them... And all the kickbacks. People there won't go out oftheir way to help. Why don't you buy him here? Or in Israel? Someone iust dropped out. A really lovely spot. A plot on the Mount of Olives. Nice and quiet. In Jerusalem. l can give you a good price. Call it a last-minute offer. These are a dead man's last wishes, Mr Sammy. lt'll cost you 30,000 euros. What? That's way too much! Ostrof isn't cheap. Ostrow! l never met or even know about! What do you want to know? Evemhing. l want to know evemhing. All right. Your father had a first wife in Poland. But it didn't last long. We can go to Ostrow by car. lt'll be easier and a lot cheaper too. l'm not going to Ukraine with you two! Think for a second. We can share the fuel costs between the three of us. Plus we speak Russian and Polish. Can you even take a body to Ukraine? Don't wory, Simon. Sammy's a friend ofthe family. He'll sort the paperwork out. Ok, but l want to know all about Dad and Sarah. We'll tell you all about it on the way, ok? What an idea, bringing your son on a trip like this. lf it's a problem, l can take you back to Brussels. Did his mother agree to let him come with us? Of course. Who do you think l am? l don't think it's right for a child. All right, Mala. Back to our stoy. We're in Ostrof. Ostrow! Ok, we're in Ostrow, iust before the war, Dad's young, he meets this Sarah... What year was it again? Know what? We won't talk about this now. You need to concentrate on the road. Look, it's dark out there. Let me get some sleep. lt's a diesel engine. lt's a vintage car and not easy to drive. l can drive anything, Simon. l even drove a tank once. Watch the gears. l changed the box two weeks ago. It cost 700 euros. Cut it out. l was driving before your father could walk. Hury up, we can't stay here, they're going to notice us. Calm down, Maurice! Calm down! That's a great disguise. No one will ever spot you. Ok, Mala, now l'm not driving, tell me. This Sarah... l'm too tired now. l'll tell you tomorrow, l promise. l'm going to sleep now. You tell me. You were there too. Look, l have to concentrate on the road. l can't do two things at once. You're a damn drag with this shim secret. Watch your mouth, Simon! What happened? That idiot in his SS boots said l was doing You were doing 140? l can't see your speedometer, it's too small. He wanted my papers, that shmok! He wanted my licence but l have nothing on me. All l have on me is my Beretta. Think l want them to know who l am? So they can hand me over to the Stasi or the Poles? Never! You have a gun on you? l always cary a loaded gun. Put that away! Put it away right now! l still have my gun, see. Put it away! They should give me money, those damn bastards! Maurice, slow down! Your brother and sister piss me off. How did you put up with them? Hear this racket? Fascinating... Hadien swimming tomomow Shit! What's going on? Hello, son. Am l dreaming? l'm really touched you've come all the way to Poland with my little Schmuli. But there's one thing l'd like more than anything. Get yourself a real iob. After good health, that's the most important thing in life. A good iob. lncredible, even dead he's pissing me off. Dad, you're dead. What the hell do you care now? Listen, my son, l'm sick of worying about you. So, please, make me happy. Find yourself a proper job. At your age, l had my own store. l designed a fabric... Please, l know the alpaca stoy by heart. Find something, Simon. lf not for yourself or for me, do it for your son. Dad, when l was a boy, Mum and you weren't exactly rich. But we were happy. Your mother was a wonderful woman, Simon. Not like that dancer you dream of going back to. You can talk, with your dumb secrets. Who is this Sarah anyway? Because ofthat dancer, my grandson isn't circumcised. That was my decision. It's far too barbaric. Answer my question. Who's Sarah? Barbaric! Barbaric, he says! Circumcision has been around 5,000 years but my son the genius has decided it's barbaric! Exactly. l had the guts to stop it. My son's complete. Enough ofthis nonsense. No, Dad, wait... Shit... Wake up! No way... Get up, you idler, it's 8:30. How long will you sleep? - Get up, Dad. - Too much sleep is bad for you! l want to sleep. lch will ghlufent We were driving all day and you two snored like walruses. Mala and l will drive then. Fucking hell! You really got me! 8:30... Ty that again and you'll hitchhike back. Don't phone and drive, Simon. lt's too dangerous. Who are you? lt's Mrs Hirschfeld. Give me the phone. Hello, Gitla? How are you? That old bat has my number? l never take my mobile with me abroad. It costs too much. So, tell me... Have you seen Dr Goldbeter? Two minutes, Mala. Good, isn't he? Know what the Poles gave us for dinner yesterday? Goloubtgit Stuffed cabbage. Yes, and they put lard in it. lt wasn't at all bad, you know. Right! Enough! Give me the phone! l have to go. Give me the phone! l'll call you back. My nephew's a bit on edge. Give me the phone! Yes, the pro-Palestinian one. l didn't tell her to take vitamins. You're incredible! Let me tell you a stoy, Simon, about what happened after the Krauts occupied our town. l was caught in a round-up with a pal. They took us to this fancy house where some rich fellow used to live. The Gestapo had moved in there. You should have seen them. Strapping men. The others gave us boots to clean. They were gone by morning and only one was left. At one point, he said, ''Come here.'' l went but l couldn't look at him. He was a superior race, see. After the war... Are you listening? Yes. l met pals who weren't with me. They had been in Russia as partisans. Those fellows knew howto drink. What did they do to a guy? They got a ierycan full of petrol, they bought rotten hooch, put it in there, made us drink it... The state l was in, Simon. You've no idea. For a week, l couldn't comb my hair because ofthe electricity in it. Where's Hadrien? He isn't at school. Is he sick? What? ln Poland? With Mala and Maurice? You've lost your mind! You kidnap my son and go to Poland? l haven't kidnapped him. Don't overreact. We'll be back after we buy Grandpa. Buy Grandpa? You realize what you're saying? You're crazy! Hadrien's only six! Calm down. He wanted to come. l knewyou wouldn't agree. Talk to your mother. Hello, Mum? Are you ok, sweetheart? Don't wory, Mum will get you home soon. Don't wory. l don't want to come home! l want to send Grandpa on his journey. l want to stay with Dad, Mala, Maurice and Grandpa. He wants to stay with us. l need him to be here with us. l want him to stay. Please. Get my son back here fast. Or l'll cut your custody rights, call the cops, cut off your balls and feed them to you to stop you pissing me off! - Hey, l respect you. - She agreed, you said? Cut it out! Of course l'm not talking to you! l think you're fabulous, divine, magnificent... Sexy and all that, fantastic, and not a ball-buster. l don't want to go home! And you said she agreed! You kidnapped Hadrien and now we're accomplices to kidnapping. Exactly, Auntie. Add illegal transport of a corpse. That's a capital offence in Ukraine. You can hang for it. Ty to be reasonable. Take the boy home to his mother. The poor woman will go mad. She's already mad! Why defend her? You can't stand her. l don't hate her. Not at all. All the same, l'm glad you're not together anymore. What if she really does call the police? Shit, he's not going to start now! Dad, was Mum really angy? Mum is a bit angy, yes. Dad's a bit angy too. Eveyone is. Being angy can be good. When you're not angy anymore, you're less angy and feel better. Why Lublin? You're hungy again? We have family here. Shit... Could you be a little more positive? Stop moaning and complicating things. We're fetching the stone. What stone? Your father's gravestone. You can't buy him without a stone! What is this Jewish nuthouse? Simon, don't be so negative. Tevi, my cousin, has invited us here. We'll pick up the stone tomorrow. l knewyour father well. We fought together against the Germans with the Russians. We were young. l wasn't 16. We were members of a youth brigade of Jewish Communists. What year was that? l don't remember exactly. Did you know my father's first wife, Sarah? Oh, yes! Sarah... And? What? Did you know my father's first wife? Who on earth is Martha Feiermann? Do you know what a stone like this costs? He'll flip it over and engrave another name on it. Where's it from? Did you steal it? Certainly not. The Feiermanns changed their minds. They want pink marble. Those people are such snobs. Orchestra conductors for generations... Two tons of stone in my car... It'll wreck my suspension. Over my dead body! Simon, that car was in Lublin. Look! Don't start again, Maurice. lt's already bad enough without the Stasi. What's the Stasi? Friends of Maurice's, sweetheart. You're using the phone again? lt's dangerous! Especially with the stone. Where are you? l knew it! l knew you wouldn't turn back! l iust saw my brother's lawyer, Lopez Garcia. He's calling the police. Don't lie. Evey border will have your photo. Turn back or you'll end up in a Polish jail. Fine... Hadrien will have a father in jail. Did you think of him before bringing that Garcia guy in. Hadrien's my son too. l can make decisions without you. No, l won't put him on! Screwyour Garcia lawyer guy. Yeah, Interpol, the Stasi, the FBl... Screwthem all! l'm an immature kid? Yeah, l'm immature. You're a fucking self-centred egotist! The world has to revolve around you! Go to Brazil with Karl, l don't give a shit! What? That's brilliant! Get married! Go ahead! No way will you take Hadrien. He's my son, he's staying! Yeah, fuck you! Fuck you and the Brazilian dancing fool! Fucking hell! There, that's the way to speak to that goy. She'll realize now she's not right for you. You spoke well, Simon. Don't let yourself be ruled by some goy who cheated on you with a darkie. After the war ended, once we were able to start eating again... That's enough! Get out ofthis car, both ofyou! l'm sick of it! Get the hell out! l don't want to get out... Fucking hell! You're 5km from Lublin. Hitch a ride, get a train, l'll cary on alone. - What's that? Shall we go in? - No, wiser not to. But what is it? lt's where Grandpa was a prisoner. lt's not a good idea. Fat Kapo Michal was here? That's right. Come on, it's not for children. But l want to go in! Hadrien! Come back here right now! Hadrien! - Schmuli! - Fat Kapo Michal! You don't run in a camp! Schmuli! Where are you? This isn't funny! Schmuli? Simon... What are you so frightened of, son? - Dad... - l wanted to say l'm proud ofyou. Proud you brought my grandson here. l know how hard it was. lt's good that you see for yourself. Why are you here? This is where we hid when the Germans wanted to transfer us to Auschwitz. This is Dan Salesmann, my old friend. Remember, l told you about him and his crooked back. He didn't make it, like the others. Just think! Your son's a fine man. Does he have a girlfriend? ls he married? Any children? Spare me... An uncircumsised son with a goy dancer! And before they even married, they split up! My son, you've no idea how happy l am that you came here with my little Schmuli. Dad? Dad? Dad! Schmuli! Where were you? Come on, let's go. Friendly guys... lt's all in Russian. Shit, my car... They'll turn it into a Lada at this rate. What do you think they're looking for? No idea. Stay right here, ok. Where's that rabbit from? From the camp where Grandpa was a prisoner during the war. Why didn't you tell Dad? We'll catch a duck and eat it for supper. Gently. To think he abandoned us at the side ofthe road, the meshuge! You know, l think he has a broken heart. That's why he's a meshuge. Believe me. Damn rabbit! Honestly, Schmuli... Dad's had enough ofyour rabbit. lt's making him sneeze a lot. Dad must be allergic. Open your windowthen. lt's raining! l don't believe this road. We'll keep it a bit, then let it go. No way. Michal is staying with us. Why call it Michal? Like Kapo Michal. Give me a break with Kapo Michal. Find another name. Michal is a dumb name. l'll call it Karl then! All right, stick to Michal. Ok, Schmuli? Are you ok? Yes... Give me your hand. Are you ok?

Stop sneaking up on me. l can't help it. l'm a ghost. Vey funny. ls it true about Sarah? She's why you wanted to come here? Who is she? Were you really married? She was the prettiest woman around here. She had a lovely pair of breasts... They all wanted to mary her but l'm the one who got her. l loved her so much. But she died too young, just after the war ended. How? She fell in the river. She caught a chill and died. lt broke my heart. For a vey long time. That's why l wory about you, my son. l know you. Your heart's fragile like mine and l'm worried that dancer will break your heart. lt's a terrible thing. But enough ofthat. l'll be seeing Sarah tomorrow. She won't believe it when l turn up. But... What about Mum? l loved your mother vey much too. Thanks to her, l had you. But she wasn't prem, poor thing, and she really got on my nerves!
