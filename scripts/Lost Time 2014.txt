Your sis is right here. Got ya. Thank you. Sweet Jesus. Okay. Just don't say something silly like, I don't know, "Morning, sunshine" or something. I wasn't, I wasn't. Hey, we should get going. Beat traffic. We're going to do this together, okay? Let me see here. Okay. I said "together." You are one stubborn chick. I've got ya. Okay, ready? One, two, three. There you go. Yeah. Got it? Come on, Speed Racer. Sorry. Just keep the juice down, okay? What's this? What's what? Okay, let's not get all dramatic about Dad, hmm? He may have been our father, but he was never our dad. He wasn't that bad. Where was he when Mom got sick? I don't know; You don't know either. He surely wasn't by her bedside. Well, he had to work a lot. I'm just saying, he was never around when shit got tough. Yeah, well, it's not so easy, believe me. I didn't mean it like that. Just, sometimes we don't know why people do what they do, and we just have to keep moving. Valerie. Hey. It might have been hard for him, but it's not for me. I do this because I love you to death. You could not get rid of me even if you tried. You're not going anywhere either. Hear me? Miracles happen every day. So we are going to remember that it is not over until it is over, and we are going to go get us some good news. Simple as that. Hmm? Let's go. Buck up, champ. Hey, Valerie, Melissa, how are we doin'? Hanging in there, hoping for the best. All right, come on in. The results aren't good. The cancer has spread aggressively, no longer contained to the left breast. It's everywhere... bone, organs, brain. So when do we start chemo? I'm sorry, Valerie. We can do another round of chemo, though, right? Quality of life should take precedence. What are you talking about, "quality of life"? I am sorry. I can recommend a social worker to aid in hospice. - She's not going to hospice. - I can take care of her. They have all kinds of things now. They have tissue treatments in Germany, stem-cell replacement. I just saw something about that last week. Are a lot of options we can still look at. Hmm? I'm done. What? I'm done, Mel. I just... I feel like... I've been running this marathon, and... there's no finish line. I'm just ready to lay down and watch it all go by. What? Just, you don't have to stay until the end. Don't even say that. Look, you were always there to pick up the pieces for me. And you might be able to chase Carter off, but you're not getting rid of me. It's me and you, Val. Till the end? And beyond. I got ya. What's going on? Okay? What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. Okay. Come on. No. Not now. Oh, no. Melissa? Please? Please? In our next show, we'll talk with Dr. Xavier Reed to discuss his book Lost Time. This is George Noory from Coast to Coast A... Hello? Valerie, this is Dr. Terry. The test results are remarkable. Valerie, are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Your rapid hair growth... it's all still a mystery. The cancer, it's completely gone. Yeah, and so is my sister. If you could just come in for a few more tests... I'm so sorry. Carter, just tell me you have something new. You feeling okay? Yeah, I'm feeling okay. Look, I've got something I want to give you. I was thinking maybe tomorrow downtown. Maybe have a coffee. That'll work. Okay, good. Hey, listen, you try and get some rest, okay? I'll see you tomorrow, baby. See you tomorrow. Steve, have you seen her? Yeah, if you hear anything... Okay. Ryan, this is Valerie. No. Nothing. The police don't have anything. Not a single trace of her. This is Valerie Dreyfuss. I'm looking for my sister, Melissa. No, I know. Of course it doesn't make any sense. That's why I'm trying everything here. God! Valerie. Watch your sister. Mr. Coffey? What the hell are you doing in my apartment? I was just taking out the trash, heard all kinds of noises. I mean, I heard banging, groans coming from inside your unit. Does it look like I need help? Uh... No. Yeah, no. Smoking in my apartment, Coffey? Please. Wait. That's it? Close the door on your way out. What's up, girl? You lose your kitty cat or something? Huh? Find some fucking scripts. Huh? What you got in this little bag? Huh? No! No! Relax. Hurry up. Find some scripts. Shh! Why don't you calm down, sweetheart? Were just gonna take a little look through your bag. No! Candy out of that, huh? Shut your fucking mouth, and we might just leave you alone. Hey. I like when you come in my neighborhood. Leave her alone. Oh! You wanna go? Yeah. Huh? You wanna fuck with me? You're a big fucking man, huh? I'm the wrong fucking man. Yeah. Huh? Hey, hey. You're okay. It's okay. What are you doing down here? Hey, it's okay. Come on. Why? Why are you doing this to yourself? Downtown passing out flyers. Alone? At least I'm doing something. You could have got yourself killed. I'm gonna do whatever it takes. No, that doesn't work for me. Not anymore. I care about you, Val, very much. Stop it. I can't. Not until I find her. Okay. Why are you giving this to me? It's all the notes we had on the case. I thought it might... help you. You're kidding me. I don't have a choice. They want me off this case Val. Melissa's gone. I know. There's got to be more. Look, there's 12 hours of unaccounted time. There's your statement and a missing person. That's it. They know how close we are. It's the only reason you're not a suspect here. Oh, come on, Carter, she's my sister. Have you ever lost somebody before? Sometimes you got to move on, Val. Easier said than done. She's out there. I hope you're right. I am right. I know. Come here. We'll find her, baby. We'll find her. Go home. Get some rest, okay? You're going to make yourself sick again, Val, if you keep pushing yourself like this. I got to go. It's work. I'm sorry. Straight home, okay? Okay. You got my number. If you need me... Straight home. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. You want to talk, baby? I don't even know what to say. Okay. I just need you. And I don't want to talk. Be ready. I just can't. Baby, please don't do this again. It's not fair. Baby, don't, don't. Hey, hey. Don't do this again, okay? Stay here. Stay here. I've just got to go. Stay here. Please? I... I just can't. Lost Time. I'm Dr. Xavier Reed. I want you all to know, no matter how dark things seem, you are not alone. Now, many of you may have had a close encounter. You just don't remember when or where. If you've experienced this trauma, like myself, you are desperate for answers. The answers you seek and more will be revealed in my new book, Lost Time. What is lost time? So let me ask you, have you ever been watching TV, a film, or driving in your car, and you drifted off for what seemed like hours, only to snap out of it and realize it all happened in a blink of an eye? Have you ever asked yourself, "Where did the time go"? St. Augustine said that time was a threefold present: The present as we experience it, the past as a present memory, and the future as a present expectation. Now, can any of you give me an example of how time may be shaped in the present? Dj vu. Mm-hmm. Anyone else? Daydreams. Daydreams. That's correct. Yes. Nightmares. Nightmares. Dj vu, daydreams, nightmares. Are they figments of our imagination or memories too frightening to remember? What would Valerie say? You see, I was once like she was. I didn't believe in anything I couldn't touch, see, feel or smell... until that one moment when I lost time. I was driving in my car on the way to a ball game when my life came to a grinding halt. There was a... a blinding light. Then it was gone, and so was my wife, Lily. Half a day passed in an instant. Where did the time go? Actually, the time didn't go anywhere. You did. You were raped of time, security, innocence. Something so unique, so sacred, can never be returned. Banished from paradise. It's food for thought. With that, I'd like to thank you all for coming, and I invite you to get my book, which I hope provides some of the answers you seek. Thank you. Dr. Reed, you're great. I'm your biggest fan. Thank you. What's your name? Greg. Here you go. Thank you for coming. Come here. Take a look at the balcony up above. Right there. Keep your eye on him. What are you doing here? Waiting for an autograph. You're following me. No. I love all this weird stuff. Hey. So, what, you're buying into this? I need answers. I know. So this guy's gonna help you with that? I don't know. Maybe he might. I worry about you. Don't worry about me. I'm just fine. No, you're not. Detective Carter. Did you enjoy the presentation? Yeah, that name thing... That's cool. I saw a guy do that once in Vegas. Well, so did I, but that was a trick. Dr. Reed... Val. It's okay. Look, I'll be in touch tomorrow. Okay. Dr. Reed, wait. I want answers. I need to find my sister. Your not ready for answers yet, Valerie. Come to my sanctuary. This is his sanctuary? Good morning, Valerie. You know who I am? Dr. Reed told me to expect you. You can call me Nurse Mary. After you. Uh, I need to talk to him. That's not possible at the moment. But I have questions. If you insist upon staying and seeing the doctor, then it's at his time, not yours. But can I see him soon? All in good time, Miss Dreyfuss. His sanctuary is completely cut off from the outside world. No cell phones allowed. It'll be returned when you leave. I'm not staying overnight. You can leave anytime you wish, Miss Dreyfuss. The door is right behind me. But our program does have its rules. Thank you, Miss Dreyfuss. Follow me. Each guest has their own private room, and we encourage journaling to log your experiences. It's all very safe. Doesn't sound safe to me. The doctor suggests that you each deal with your trauma in your own way. What the fuck's your problem? No problem. Voices in my head... too loud. The doctor encourages this? The doctor encourages self-expression and introspection. Whatever helps you find your path towards your own truth. Come along. Your room is down the end of the hall. I don't need a room. Oh, just give it a night. I'm not staying. It is the only way you'll see Dr. Reed. Mr. Elliot will come get you for group session. Can I help you? What are you doing here? She's not here. Mr. Coffey, have you seen her? Yeah, she was here earlier, but she beat it early. - I keep an eye on things. - Yeah, of course you do. This legal? Jesus. Yeah, I know. She's not doing good, man. You dropped something. Yeah, this is Detective Bill Lance. Hey, Bill, it's Carter. Hey, Carter, how you doing? Yeah, all good, man. Look, I need a favor. I need a location. You are supposed to be in your room. I'm s... I'm sorry. Do not worry. Each has their own unique reaction to it all. I'm Mr. Elliot. Dr. Reed has asked for you. This place been here a while? Long time. Easy to get lost. You have no idea. Thank you, Mr. Elliot. Having visions with your sister again, Valerie? Oh, what, now that Blondie's here, we can start? Please, sit down. You're all suffering from a type of post-traumatic stress. You're part of a select group that I call "lost timers." Pretty cool name. I can dig it. Right, girl? I'm not your girl. Next time you touch me will be your last. Keep your hands to yourself, Rico. This is not a self-help group or a 12-step program. No touchy-feely here. Now, you all have questions that you'd like answered. I can do that for you. Now, the work here will be difficult. It will be direct and sometimes very painful, but it will lead to the answers you seek. Oh, fuck! Mary. Thank you, Mary. As you can see, you're all suffering from different symptoms. Gillian... Well, Gillian, she lives in the numina. She operates on a higher frequency that causes her to tap into vibrational energy and hear voices. And, of course, her nose bleeds. Gale has synesthesia. It's a type of M.S. Her nerve endings are hypersensitive. Everyone has their breaking point, which we're all here to avoid... even you, Rico. I will be helping each one of you with your symptoms. Dr. Reed, it's time. Well, we've made some progress today. Please get some rest, and I'll see everyone in the morning. I'm looking forward to working with all of you. And remember, the door is always open. You can leave anytime you want. But if you leave, you can never come back again. What the hell? My shit's getting more fucked up by the day. I need something. You guys can circle-jerk. I don't do this group thing. Gale, what happened to you? My partner... We were on patrol. Next thing you know, he's already dead. His chest was all cut up. They branded him with symbols. I was suspended, pending an investigation. Guess the LAPD don't believe in UFO's neither. UFO's? What do you think I'm dressed like this for? 'Cause you're vice? Fuck you. Because they messed with us. The faintest light hurts my eyes. The-The slightest smell turns my stomach. I can hear a goddamn pin drop. And I should... What, they didn't fuck with you somehow? Shit, my UTP is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Before that, life was fucking boring. It was all Leave It to Beaver shit. Safe is no good. Safe kills us inside. They don't like safe. Safe doesn't exist. Who's "they"? Safe fucking sucks. You wouldn't believe the crazy shit I've done the last couple of months. I just don't care no more. Wife and kids up and left the moment the nightmares started. Thought it was from Iraq, you know? Hey, fuck it. I'm single now, right? That's it! All right! All right! I'm sorry. Release him, Gale. To your room now. Whatever. Try that again, I'll break your fingers. How's that? Turns me on, actually. And I suggest the two of you do the same. You're in for a very long night. Told you. Shit gets more fucked up every day. Whoa. I mean, I've been really on edge. Inoperable tumor, courtesy of them. Aneurism could pop anytime. How's that for "on edge"? I'm sorry. Yeah, well, whatever. Fucking cancer, right? See you in the morning unless we lose it before then. Welcome to rock bottom. I've been expecting you, Valerie. Dr. Reed, I came here for answers, answers you said you could help me with. And I will. But the answers you seek are inside you. I can only assist in helping you access them. Then help me. Why am I still alive? Why was my sister... Go on, say it, Valerie. Why was she taken? Abducted? Is that what you want to say? There's no evidence. Where is the evidence? No one has any answers... not the police, not Carter... And there won't be. That's what makes this so delicate. There are no forensics, no fingerprints. Just flashes of an experience buried inside you. It's why I suggested that you come here to a safe environment. Away from those who want to keep you in the dark, in fear. You have to let go of your fear to remember what happened. How can I do that? Surrender. Let go of the illusions you're holding on to. A new reality is created when you have full acceptance of this one. Let me help you, and I promise the truth will come. Yeah, hey, Bill, it's Carter. Any luck with that address? Still looking, Carter. - I need it right away. - This is for Valerie, okay? But I like her. She's nice. She doesn't know yet. Doesn't know about you. Who's there? I don't wanna go. Let's start with her. Valerie, Valerie, Valerie... He's watching. Who are you? Be ready. What the fuck? Mel. What's happening? This is Carter. Hey, what did you get? You did? Yeah, I got it. Thanks for that. Well, look, just don't tell him. I don't care what the captain told you. Just don't tell him. Right. Yeah. Well, you know, look, if you don't hear from me you know it didn't go to plan. No, she's a little more than that. you know that. Okay. Thanks. I'll be in touch. Yeah, later. No! No! No! Aah! No! No. Don't touch me. No, not the... the kids. Not my babies. Want what's inside me. Wants what's ours, but it's not to give. It's not theirs. No. Oh, fuck! It stopped! Fucking batteries! Fuck! Oh, God! No! Stop it! No! No! Oh, God! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! No, you can't. No, you can't. You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't do this! You can't! It's too much! It's too much... Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! They killed her. They did this to her. We're getting out of here. Are you lost? I'm fine. Valerie Dreyfuss... where is she? She wants to be here, Detective. No one is leaving. I don't think you understand. She's leaving with me. Now. Where is she? Here. I'm not going to ask you again. You came just for her. How human. Get out. Get out of my head. I said, go away. Go away! You go! Go! Go! Get out of my head. Go! Fuck off! We need to retrieve and harvest the Nubot. Now. Rico. Rico. Open the door. Rico? Nightmares. This isn't happening! It is happening. He knew. He knew we would do this. My God. Gillian! What are you doing? Eva? No, Eva! Boo-hoo. I miss my sister. It's all happening to me. Me, me, me. You're all so weak. Eva is ours. No. Fight back, Eva. Fight back! She cannot. You belong to him now. You have a visitor. Shh. Why are you doing this? Shh. Daddy's coming. What? Where are we? He needs you. Did you miss me, sister? You're not my sister. You're ready now. Why? You are the strong one. Unlike your sister. Where is she? Where is she? Wake up! Look who's here. He came to save you, so we let him in. Your hero. It's the moment of reckoning, Valerie. The answer to your question. You've been prepped and readied. You have one of these... they're called Nubots... inside you. All your memories, your DNA, your entire essence, attaches on it. You see, we're looking for what was removed from Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before you took that bite out of the apple, and we're getting closer. And since humans have the ability to elevate, to evolve, it must be developed, cultivated, and grown inside of you to then be harvested and used by us. The God gene. It's the new Genesis. Mr. Elliot. Our race is dying. There is no moral question here. The Nubot inside you will carry your DNA through a portal to our world. You will save our kind. You'll feel the creature detach itself from your cervical spine. It will be excruciating. But then it'll be over, and you will rest... forever. Shh. Baby... What have they done to you, baby? What have they done to you? Baby, just breathe. Everything's gonna be okay. Stay with me, baby. I love you, baby. It's okay. It's all right. Baby, baby... Baby, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay it's okay, it's okay. Come on, baby. Baby, we've got to get you dressed. Okay? We got to get you out of here. Come on. Get you out of here. Come on. Come on. Come on, baby. We gotta go. We gotta go, okay? I got to get you out of here. Okay? Get out out of here. Come on, baby. Come on. I got you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Carter, I got this. Are you sure? I'm good. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. I got you. Come on. It's okay. Come on! Okay. Stay with me, baby. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me. Come on. Stay close to me, baby. Come on, baby! Wait! Eva! Eva! Wait, Carter. We have to go get Eva. Who the fuck is Eva? She's just a girl. We have to go back. I got to get you out. Come on. No, wait! Wait, please! We've got to go get her. Please. I can't leave her here. Where is she? She's in her room. Please. Okay, come on. Come on. Come on. My name is Eva Serling. I won't let them beat me. I'll fight back. Illuminati. Evil... Illuminati. Illuminati. Evil... Illuminati. Eva? Hi, honey. Hi. Come on. Valerie? He's gonna help us get out. Come on. We've got to go. We're gonna go home. We're gonna get you home. Remember your home? Baby, baby, we're not gonna hurt you. We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Gonna get you out. You stay with Valerie, okay? No! No! No, no, no! No! You lose everyone you love. No! Run. Forgive me. Fuck! No! You disappoint me. What happened to us? My gift to you. Someone help... Val! Val! What's happening? Mel, Mel, they-they... they're doing... What? They c... They cut me open. Where? Where? Where? Show me! Hurts. Oh, it hurts. Whoa. It's them. Listen to me. Listen to me. My beautiful sister. I'm already dead. Listen to me. You have to live for both of us. Yes. No. What are you talking about? I'm here with you till the end. And beyond? Always. Always. No! You were supposed to take me, OT my sister. Why did you send me back? Because your genetic code is more advanced. Why don't we finish what we began? Hello, Reed. Miss me? Still playing doctor? Still searching for paradise? Still trying to elevate, to change? Shouldn't we all be? Don't trust anyone, Valerie. She's under our protection now. Protection or captivity? What protection? What... It's over. How... How is this possible? It feels so real. That's because it is real. You two are something special. We know because we watch all of you. Valerie, are you ready to let her go? We had some beautiful moments, didn't we? Better than most. And then it ends. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Goodbye, Melissa. No one is ever gone. Can he come back? Probably. And your kind? We're just here, watching... and waiting. For what? For you to open the door and walk through it. Where are we? You changed the outcome. Now you need to go back. The outcome? Reed. We need to stop their kind. Valerie, there are multiple outcomes you can experience. Every possible experience will happen in other dimensions. All these parallel universes occupy the same space, but in different dimensions. A very small difference in a choice or thought can change the whole world. Will change the outcome. Your outcome. Just like the tiny butterfly that flaps its wings.. And makes the hurricane. We all play our part. I'm playing my part by sending you back to another dimension. You understand. Are you ready? Go. Eva! Valerie? We're not gonna hurt you. No! No! What did you do? What did you do? She was going to kill you. What do you mean? Her body's mine. Run. Go. Go. Now! Move! Come on! Move. Come on, this way. Come on, baby! Move! Baby, I don't know if we're gonna make it out of here. We're gonna keep running. You understand me? Go! Go! Carter! Hello, Lieutenant. Hey. Have you been waiting a long time? A while. Mm. You look beautiful. Thank you. You ready? No. Come on, let's go do this thing. Okay. You feel okay? Yeah. Oh, come on. You invited Coffey to this thing? Come on, be nice. Oh, come on. Hey. Hi. Thank you so much for being here. Oh, for sure. I mean, wow, what a party. And you, congratulations on your promotion. Thank you, Mr. Coffey. Thanks for coming. - Carter. - John, how are you? Good. Good to see you. Congratulations on the promotion. Thank you for everything you did on the case, okay? Really appreciate it. No problem. That's what I do. I'll be back in a minute. Okay. See you soon. Let me introduce you to my wife. Hi. Pleasure. Nice to meet you. I miss her being around. Is she doing okay? Yeah, she's getting there. Thanks for everything you did. Thanks for sticking around and keeping an eye on things. I really appreciate it. Did you find the answers you were looking for? Hello, Valerie. Saved your hero? You have what I need; I have what you want: Your sister. It's time.
