No, you can't work for nothing. No, really, ma'am. I can't find my wallet. I don't understand. I just picked up my pension at the post office. Maybe you left it there. No, I had it later when I was shopping. Maybe you dropped it there, or in the parking lot. Yes, maybe I did, as I loaded my bags in -- Better hurry back. There are lots of thieves around there. - Come watch me solder this. - Right after I pee. Watch. You stay half an inch away. You don't touch it. When the two edges are bright red... zap! One quick touch. Here. No, the other way. - I gotta go. - No, finish this first. I have to go. Listen, tell him this is the last time you leave during work hours. Yes, sir. See you tomorrow.

Cold? - Okay. Nabil. Nabil, it still stinks like shit downstairs. We gotta do something. It's no use just clearing the pipe. It's too small. There's a bigger pipe in the shed. Okay. Hamidou only gave me $600 for his wife's trip. You think he's bluffing? He had money last night. Maybe he was gambling. - Try to find out. - Okay. - Anything else up? - No. I mean, yes.

My residence permit. Hello. We said 10,000 to have clients here. He's not a client. He's a friend. I'm not an idiot. That's another 5,000. It's fair. A room for that in town costs 20,000. My permit. Have a good screw. - What do you want? - A canister of gas. Four hundred francs. Can I pay at the end of the month? I can't just let them be cold. Four hundred's not much. Yeah, but I lost yesterday. It's not my problem if you always lose. Just stop gambling. Here. Thanks. Hello. Is Mr. Mller in? That's not much time. What are they? Turks and Ghanians. Will you hold on? The press is hounding the mayor about foreigners. He wants the police to do something. I might be able to round up four. Four more. Don't look. Close your eyes. What's going on? Look. You painted it. So? Look right there. The jaguars. I'll swipe one more for here. Then we'll each have one. - Igor? - What? - Come here! - We're working on the go-kart. Let's go! I'll be right back. Roger... van...

Another 120,000 and the house is ours. - Thanks. - Thanks who? Roger. If anyone asks, I'm at Mller's, okay? See ya in a while. Be right back. Watch the hot rod. Hey, you got a cigarette? No, I won!

Thanks. - What's she doing? - What? What's she doing? He must be protected against evil spirits in his new home. - There are no evil spirits here. - Yes, there are. We don't see them, but they see us. See you later. Listen, who do you think you are? You signed a contract to apprentice here. It's not my fault, sir. I had to help my father. I don't give a damn about your father. You work here. You come on time. Your job is to come on time. Got that? - Yes, sir. - What's that? - What? On your arm. A tattoo. - Who did that? - Roger. My father. Why's he draw on your arm instead of on paper? Paper's not just for wiping your ass. Hello? Yeah. Listen, this is his work place. I'll put him on. I have to go. Listen, you want to become a good mechanic? Then stay here... or never set foot in my garage again. The labor inspectors are here! Out the back! The inspectors are here! Ibrahim, labor inspectors! Where's Hamidou? - Up there. Hamidou, scram! The inspectors are here! Turn the music off. Hamidou, you okay? You're not gonna die, Hamidou. You're gonna be all right. My wife... my child... look after them. Say you will. I promise. Igor? Where are you? Where are you, Igor? Right here. You believe me now? I've been yelling for you for five minutes. I couldn't hear anything up there over the music. Can I see your ID? - What's going on? - Looking for illegals. You should be in school. I'm an apprentice. Here's my contract. - Why aren't you there? - I did some overtime, so the boss gave me a day off. - Who was on the mixer? - Me. I was -- He asked the boy. He was. Why wasn't he near the mixer when we got here? I don't know. I can't see from up there. I told you. I was making a phone call. Very well. Good-bye. I'll show you out. Hamidou, you all right? - What's wrong? - He fell off the scaffold. We gotta get him to the hospital. He's bleeding bad. - What'll we tell 'em? - I don't know. That he got hit by a car. Help me tighten it! Outta the way! Get some sand to cover up the blood. Get some sand! Ibrahim and the others are coming back. Pile some boards on there. No! They might be back. It's too risky. Not today. Catch it! This way. - Isn't my husband working today? - They all took off. Some inspectors paid a surprise visit. I'm only keeping 10,000 a month 'cause he owes me. - You owe me money too. - Me? I had to give the driver my gold bracelet to bring my son along. You told my husband the price was for both of us. That's the driver's business. I just handle housing and papers. Get the wheelbarrow. Igor, get the wheelbarrow. Go on. Dump it in. I said dump it in! Dump it! Igor? He's not here. - He told me to come by. - I said he's not here. - Where is he? - I don't know. - When's he coming back? - I don't know. Come back tomorrow. Take your T-shirt off. Why've you got your socks on? Give 'em to me. Wash your feet. Give me your ring. I'll clean it. Tomorrow go see how his wife's reacting. Why me? She can't stand me. You'll get more out of her. Want something to eat? Okay. Good night. It's not our fault he fell. It was an accident. If he hadn't fallen, none of this would have happened. Good night. Try using this. - There. - Thanks. Where'd you get this? The boy at the market brought it. - For milk for the baby? - No, it's a male. It's for the Festival of Sacrifice. The heat stopped working last night. Those gas things never work. I'll get something else. You can take the wood in the shed. I'll cut more if it runs out. I can do it myself. Are you Hamidou's wife? - We'd like to see him. - He's out. - Where is he? - I don't know. What do you want with him? Tell him Mehmet and his brother will be back tomorrow for their 10,000. - Why's he owe you money? - Gambling debts, my gazelle. It's lit now. At night just turn the handle. Wait. Has my husband disappeared before because he owed money? I don't know. Good-bye. Why didn't you tell her it's happened before? I was going to, but -- Anyway, that's what she thinks. - You sure? - Yeah, or she wouldn't have asked. There you go, big guy. You better go back. Say you have to check the heating or something. Say you remembered he split for a week once 'cause he owed us money. That'll buy us some time. Maria, I'm taking another beer. Okay. By the way, that gas heater was shot, so I gave her the wood stove. The wrought-iron one? Shit. That was for Maria. Yeah, but I couldn't fix the gas one. Aren't you eating anything? No, I'm not hungry. See ya tonight. - Where you going? To fix the go-kart. Maria's almost done. Come with us to the pool. I don't feel like swimming. Hey, you got a cigarette? I was on my way to see you. Can you do me a little favor? - What? I'll give you 1,000 francs to give this to Hamidou's wife. Tell her you owed him from gambling last week. Roger know about this? How much to keep my mouth shut? Another thousand? Two? - When do I give it to her? - Right now. Why'd you do that? Come here! What did he do? It's none of your business, Maria! Roger, stop it! Why'd you do it? You're gonna kill him! You hear me? Stop it! Have you lost your mind? Leave us. You're not to go back to see her. I'll handle it. And no more sneaking around behind my back. Okay? Come on. Get up. Want me to finish your tattoo? Come on. If Nabil hadn't called me, would you have gone on lying to me? Come on, stop crying. It's nothing. It's all over. Come on, stop crying. Roll up your sleeve. You ever been with a girl? You know -- screwing. You never been laid? You should. You're old enough. You ever want to? - Yeah, sometimes. She said to go up on the hill and whistle And wait for her there with a bouquet of wild roses I gathered the flowers and whistled my heart out I waited and waited but she never came Let her go, scumbag! Get the hell outta here! It's a jungle around here. You'll never manage on your own. Especially with the kid. How long since Hamidou disappeared? Almost a week? You'd be better going back home. You kicking me out? I'm just saying it'd be better for you and the kid. What if I hadn't been here when that creep -- My husband will be back. He left because of a debt. He'll hear I paid it off and come back. - When was that? - Three days ago. Then he should be back by now. Something else must be going on. I've been renting places out for five years. I've seen lots of guys go crazy from living far from home. I knew a Ghanian man. He lived right above you. The day he got the papers saying he was legal, he got smashed and killed his wife and kids. Don't say things like that. There's a flight every Tuesday from Frankfurt to Burkina Faso. If you want, I'll buy you a ticket. - He'll come back. - And if he doesn't? What'll you do? Look for him. Go to the police. She bites like a jackal! I should get double. Look what she did. That was our deal. You should have handled it better. A Korean man will be here tonight. You take care of it. - Where you going? - To see the notary about a few things. - When's this gotta happen? - Soon as possible. What if something goes wrong? What could go wrong? Those women can be stubborn. They've got principles. - We'll cross that bridge then. - No, you've gotta be prepared. It could cost you. How much you offering? I don't know. What do you think? It's working now. Rent... sleep here... money. Dollars? Show me. Two. There. Good night. - You got a cigarette? - Smoke your dick. Who's there? Igor. This is Hamidou's radio. - Where was it? - Next door, in the white house. It could get stolen over there. Good-bye. No, come in. What's wrong? Hamidou's not gone. He's close by. The chicken entrails say so. He's close by. Who's there? - Telegram. Madame Assita Badolo? A telegram for you. Good night. Read it to me. What is it? Read it. "In Cologne. Meet at train station tomorrow. Hamidou." Where's Cologne? Not far. An hour by car. In Germany, near the border. I'll be going. Good night. - What are you doing here? - She got a telegram from Hamidou. Really? What's he say? He's in Germany. - Where? - Cologne. - When's he coming back? - He's not. I'm going there. Then everything's worked out. I found some housecleaning work for you, but no point in that now. Tomorrow's Saturday, right? I have to go to Germany, near Cologne. I could drive you. - How much? Nothing. I have to go anyway. She came to get me about her stove. I said not to go see her! Here's the Korean guy's money. - No, come with me. - What about the moped? In the van. Get in. What do we do when she realizes he's not in Cologne? That's my problem. She'll come back. I said that's my problem. What? He's not in Cologne. - Where is he? - I don't know. Let me drive. - Stop! - Watch it! - I said stop! - In a minute. Stop! Okay, okay. Tell me where my husband is. Not in Cologne. That's all I know. Roger meant to sell you as a whore. - As a what? - As a whore. Are you telling the truth? What about the telegram? Roger sent it. Take me to the police station. My father's wrong, but I'm no snitch. To hell with your father. I want to find my husband! Take me to the police! - They'll say he was here illegally. Take me there. He couldn't have left a week ago. - He's been gone a week. - It's true. He came back illegally, and illegal entries aren't reflected in our records. Do you have a picture of him? Age? Forty-two. - Height? - Normal. Brown eyes. Hair? Frizzy black hair? No, gray. Skin color -- black. Distinguishing marks? Any distinguishing marks on his face or body? Any scars? - He's missing three toes. - Which foot? The left. Some marble fell on it in the quarry. You know where he was going when he left? - To work. - He was working? No, he was just helping us fix a wall. Who's "us"? My father and me. - Then you saw him after this lady did? - Yes. What time? I don't know. Around 11 :00. Where? Rue Ferrer. Near her place. That's 215 francs, please. There are lots of shits like Roger in your country. - They broke the statuette. - Leave it alone. Give me that. Don't touch it. Pour some water on my hair. That's enough. Go on. He sleeps here except for weekends, when he's at his wife's place in the country. You have any family besides in Africa? People you know? - The baby's uncle is in Carrara. - Where? Carrara. There's a marble quarry there, like at home. It's in Italy. You should go there. Where in Italy? I don't know. I'll look in the dictionary. I know he keeps one here for crossword puzzles. It might be a small town that's not in here. - Is there any cold water? - Yes. Why? For the baby. Is he sick? Yes, he has a fever. Tomorrow I'll see if there's a train for Italy. What do you mean? - I'm not going to Italy. Why? You have family there. You'll be safe. - His father is my family. - You can't stay here! You have to go! The chicken says he's here, and I'm staying. To hell with the chicken! Get out! I want to sleep. You'll end up a whore, and I'll get a beating. - Out! - I should never have helped you! Out! What's wrong with you? Let go of me. Hello. Igor, where are you? I know it's you. Did you tell her anything? Igor, answer. Igor, for God's sake! Come back, Igor. I won't hit you. Tell me where to come get you. The van's on rue Cockerill. The keys are in the bumper. Assita? Hospital! What's wrong? Crawl back into your mother's womb! You gave my baby a disease! Get away! Hospital! I'll get a car from the garage and drive you. Not you! Go away! You want my baby to die. You gave him a disease. Go away! You all want him to die, don't you? You, your father, all of you! All you white people! Go away! You okay? Assita, you okay? - Yes. We have to get him to the hospital. He's dying. My baby's dying. We have to get to the hospital. I'll get a car from the garage and come right back. Wait. I have to know. My husband isn't dead, is he? Tell me. I have to know. No, he's not dead. Does she have an address here? - Yes, she has a residence certificate. - May I see it? She needs your residence certificate. What's wrong with him? He has a fever. No insurance? You'll have to pay the whole sum. - How much? - It's 1,350 francs. - This is all I've got. - And the rest? - Can I bring it tomorrow? - No. - How much does he need? - Four hundred fifty francs. Inside your son is an ancestor protesting in rage, causing these bouts of fever. Until that ancestor obtains justice, fever will shake your child like a fish out of water, flapping its gills. Here. When you sense the fever coming on... soak those roots in water, have him take a few swallows, and wash him with the rest. Tell me what's on your mind. Is his father with the ancestors? You know better than I do. Do you want to know if your husband is still alive? Very well. Bring the sand up to your lips and blow on it. Concentrate on your desire to know what's happened to your husband. Pour the sand here. I don't see a grave for him in the ancestors' cemetery. It's the heat. If there's no grave for a man in the ancestors' cemetery, he'll die on foreign soil, far from his native land. Is he alive? I see nothing to indicate that he's dead. Is the child's uncle in Belgium too? - No, in Italy. - Go to him as soon as you can. Tell him to protect the child. What about my husband? You're leaving to protect his son. You're not abandoning your husband. The problem is her papers. You're not legal? I know a guy who might help, but he'll want money. May I, ma'am? My name's Rosalie. - Are you legal? - Yes, I have dual citizenship. You could lend her your papers. No, she doesn't look like me at all. Sure she does! Give her your scarf. Look, it works. You look the same. Watch this. Excuse me, sir. Whose ID is this? Hers or hers? The one in the turban. - See? It works. - If you say so. That's 7,500. - No more? - No, that's today's rate. All right. - What's that for? - A little rough play at the game. You going? Where you going? I don't know. Back to your babe? What babe? Your dad came to our place. He thought you two were hiding out there. How old is she? - My age. Are you done with the go-kart now that you've got a girl? When will you be back? - Soon. Here. The key. We can ride it without you? - Watch the brakes. - Okay. See ya. There's a train this afternoon. I got French and Italian money. There's some soup here. I found a can in the cupboard. - Thanks. - If you want, I could fix the statuette. - Okay. - Why are you putting him back in? - He's still warm. You believe what the seer said? Why shouldn't I? - Even the ancestor thing? - Yes. Can you hold him a minute? When my husband comes back, tell him I'm in Carrara. Tell my husband I'm in Carrara. If he doesn't come back, go to the police. - Why? - To find out what happened. I couldn't contact you anyway. You have no address. I'll send it to Rosalie with her ID card. I'll fix the statuette. We gotta get going. Thanks for your help. Where is she? We have to tell her the truth. Come on. Let's tell her. Stay here! He's chained up. He can't move. You sure? I'll get the bags and be right back. Igor, let me loose! In God's name, let me loose! Come here! Come here and let me loose! Tell her I have money for her to go home. All she wants. Wait! I'm begging you. I swear I was gonna give her this. She can go anywhere she wants. Just let me loose. Why do you want to tell her? What good will it do her? She leaves and we never talk about it again. At least give me my glasses. The building's all for you. Everything I did was for you. I was only thinking of you. You're my son. Shut up! Give me my glasses. Give me my glasses and let me loose. I'm your father. You can't do this. Let me go. I'm begging you. Hamidou's dead. He fell off a scaffold. I wanted to take him to the hospital, but my father wouldn't do it to avoid any trouble. I obeyed him. We buried him in cement behind the white house.
