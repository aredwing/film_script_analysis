The work have been accumulated... and I have a little time|for the Empress. The ministers are|already reunited. Send them in. Please, gentlemen. Excellency, make your report. The fact that created some|problems in the Congress... was the amnesty that Your|Majesty gave to the Hungarians. And I do not hesitate to say that... All the ministers were|against this amnesty. Why? We all have the same opinion|that the amnesty represents... a new and great danger|to the Austrian nation. It will be worst if we|consider them our enemies. I will give the amnesty,|even against the ministers will. I could... The amnesty will be|given immediately. The countess Sofia! I need to speak in private with|the baroness Esterhazy! Baroness Esterhazy, I nominated you|master of the Empress... because of the great|confidence I have in yours. Everything the Empress does,|it must be informed to me. This way, I'll have conditions to conduct|better the life of this young lady! Concerning to the mutual confidence... I'll report myself|the best way is possible. What do you have to report? One more time,|they brought a new parrot. I ask your permission|to lock it in the backyard... because the scream is terrible. If the Empress likes animals so much... you must keep them|where she wants! And if the noise bothers you... I suggest you to|put cotton in your ears! Open this drawer. - What book is that?|- The Empress' diary. Give me it. Do you have anything|else to report me? The Empress complains of|our installations for the bath. Maria Teresa lived|and took bath here. For someone that is empress|by accident, it's very good! - What else? - She asked if... colonel Bckl from Ischl|did not show up for an audience. Bckl? From Ischl? I do not know him! So, mister, look at me! Don't you remember me, mister? - Have you a hair cut?|- Try to concentrate. - Yes, the mustache's gone!|- More concentration! Bckl! You turned to a colonel! And I was transferred to Vienna! Really? Congratulations!|And how did you get it? Remember the ring the Empress,|that was a princess, pledged? Yes, to send|a telegram. I gave this ring back to the|Empress in an audience... and she ordered me|to be transferred... to stay at the entire|disposition of the Empress! - My dear Elisabeth.|- Our Elisabeth! No, my Elisabeth! My friend, something|awful happened to me. What was it? Imagine it, I fell in love|with the Empress! - What?|- When she looks at me... my heart blows up...|I start trembling. When she smiles,|I feel I could faint! - Bckl!|- The smile! That lovely smile! That's love. I'll never learn|to speak Croatia. - What will we do now?|- Hungarian class. Well, I like everything|that's Hungarian! - You too, isn't it?|- I hate everything that's Hungarian. Ah, yes, you lost|your husband in Hungary. I'm sorry to wake up|this so bad recollection. What are you bringing,|baroness? The Royal Highness Sofia asked me|to give this to Your Majesty... the instructions for the ceremonial|procedures from the Spain Court... the ones that Your Majesty|must study completely. Nineteen pages? What does it mean:|It'll have access to the palace... only noble women|and honor ladies? The noble women and the ladies|are the ones that receive... authorization to come into|the Empress facilities. And it's pre notified|that these people belong to... twenty-three most|traditional families... and two hundred and twenty nine|ladies of high level. Well, I'll see if I can|understand this silly thing. Baroness Bellegarde? Send Doctor Falk in... just for me|to relax my mind. Were you in session|with the Emperor? Yes, Your Highness! I can see on your face that is not|nice what you have to tell me. I am afraid that Your Highness|will be chocked as much as I am. No more grammar for today. If Your Majesty allow me... I wanted to tell you about the|beauty of Hungary. It is a pleasure! Did you|bring anymore pictures? Sure!|Some of Putza... Some of the Hungary plans. with their sheet flock|and bull-calf. This is the Real Palace... that is not used|for 354 years. When will we have a king again... a king that respects the freedom|of the Hungary people? I will do everything I can|to help your country. It is strange... but I feel myself more related|to the Hungary land... than to any other country,|even I do not know it. I can see it! But also the Hungarians that|also know you... only through what I write... have for Your Majesty|a great respect... because they know that you are|their guard angel! Did you really take the state of siege|off and gave amnesty to the Hungarians? Yes, mother. The amnesty is for the commander of the|rebels, the Baron Andrassy, as well? Of course it is. In my country|where I am so happy... I do not want to see|anybody sad! But Franz, you can not conduct a|nation with your feelings. We had set that any|rebel act... would be punished very hard. But the peace we conquer|through the love. I can already imagine who put|this idea on your mind. You are right Sissy! And I am so grateful|to her for that! I am curious to know if|you will be grateful for this. What is that? Her diary. How did you get|her diary? It does not matter!|Listen to this! I do not want to read it|without her permission. So I will read this poem for you. "The fresh spring|is coming" "And bring to the trees|a green freshing" "The birds learn the new songs..." "and the flowers|see a gorgeous splendor" It is very beautiful, mother! "But is here the home|of spring?" "This so weird|and rich?" "I am in search for|my sunny land" "I am in search for|my rest at the beach!" Must I go on? I would like you|to leave me alone. I can notice that new|habits grew between us. - Who is next?|- Our representative in Paris. - Get him in two minutes.|- Yes, Your Majesty! Hi, Franz! I'm leaving, but|I was missing you. Do you still love me? - Neither a little bit!|- Why? Because you don't care|about me during the day. Come on, me? You are|the one who does that! You are always behind|that desk. Sometimes I don't remember|the way you are. Yes, it's true! Yes, I am jealous... Jealous?|Of who? Of this desk! My diary? Yes, my mother brought it. So she took it|off my drawer. I don't know, but|I even touched it. It would be weird if you|had touched it. My mother just read|a very beautiful poem. Do you miss Bavaria? - yes, when I am alone.|- Sissy... but now your country|is Austria. But I cannot avoid|remind the mountains. My parents and my|sisters. Do you understand me? Yes and no. I do everything to make|you happy here. I thought that you were|happy here! I am, but only when|you are with me! But, you are almost never here. The correspondent in Paris,|Baron Von Hubenr! Let him in. We will see each other in dinner.|What will you do till there? I'm going to wait for you!|Maybe I will ride... But before dinner,|I need to show you a thing. So, colonel, this way... do you want to speak|with the Empress? - I think it is not right, what about you?|- Please, I'm here to work. Do you think I am here|for pleasure? Colonel, so far, you have been|a rude military... but here, in the Court, where|the good manners prevail... and you should learn them. You will ask|for one audience with the Empress... to speak with Her Majesty! And if she wants to. Or else|you should wait till Her Majesty... Get up.|Get up. Turn yourself... Your face is not|strange for me! We already saw each other before,|Highness! In Ischl... I had the pleasure...|the honor... Yes, I remember! You were the idiot that told|the greatest imbecilities! Me? Mr. Master of ceremonies,|tell the Colonel... that he should not do|questions here in the Court. Of course, Your Highness! - And you are stepping in my dress.|- Sorry, Your Highness! So the Royal Highness|doesn't keep any bitterness! Neither me for her! Here in the Court you should not|criticize noble people. It was not a criticize,|it was an affirmation. In the Court you should not|even to affirm... or neither do anything. For what I see,|the things will be difficult. Where were we? - There.|- No... - What were we talking about?|- About good manners! Well, first you should ask for an|audience with the Empress... Second, you should wait for the|authorization of the Empress... for the audience. And third, you should wait to know|when the audience with the... Empress... - Calm down, it won't happen again.|- No, no, it is the Empress. I'm glad to know that the Emperor|made my wish to have you here. I would like to say that... Yes? I... So?|What would you like to say? I forgot. I know, I want that|Your Majesty knows... that I will be your most|faithful servant... That impresses me! - For God sake!|- What happened, Colonel? Hurry up, a glass of water! - Are you all right?|- That smile! The smile. What smile? - The smile!|- My smile? Yes... No! The Empress' smile! My kitty, did you|wake up in a bad mood? First of all, I am not|your kitty... and second, I feel excellent! - What did you say?|- I feel excellent! Good!|Good morning, Countess. I want to know if the Empress|have already studied the ceremonial. Not yet, Your Highness!|She went to ride. I already knew it! The horses are|more important than everything! If you want to know, for me|they are too! Now I am going|for a walk. - Good-bye, Sofia.|- See you! - What is going on?|- Oh, Jesus! - Good morning, my dear father in law!|- Good morning, Your Majesty! I knew you were here|and I came to see you. I am glad!|What is up? Fine! But you don't need|to speak so loud... - I can hear very well!|- Since when? Well, I always heard well. But I only|hear what I want to hear. If it is something that I don't|want, I turn to a deaf. And then people have to|ask several times... and then they give up and|I save an answer! Ouch, you are original! But Majesty, keep this|between us. - I promise you!|- Great. - See you!|- See you, Your Majesty! What are you telling me? Did the Empress go shopping? Yes, the Empress|have been to street market! - Who told you that?|- The coachman. He said that she badly|could leave the coach... and the crowd almost tore|her dress. Inadmissible! Are you already ready? I am curious to know|what you have to show me. Well... Do you know that we have|a new parrot? - The red one?|- Yes. - Who gave it?|- Aunt Maria! I want to know also... - if you know what day is it today.|- Today? Thursday. Well, you must have forgot, after all|you have a lot of work to do. - It's a month that we got married!|- Really? - One month?|- Yes. A wedding present,|I hope you like it. What nice of you!|I am glad you remembered it. I found it in a|stand in the street market. Have you been in the street market? And I almost don't get back home. The people are so nice. They were so happy|seeing me that they almost tore my dress. See! It is a Wigand paintings! The castle door,|the village entrance. - Fabulous!|- Everything is so well done. Like the trees, he painted|them so beautifully. And what is that? It is the Weil village,|in Baden. And the one what is that? My wedding present! So, you didn't forget it? I could never forget... the way you make me happy|each minute! I am very happy too! Well... now we should go,|we have visitors... I will come to take this later. But, what is that? A beer of Munich... and a pig foot! This is my|surprise, mother. You are so special, Franz! I miss that. Do you want a little beer? No, I prefer liqueur! - What about you, my dear father in law?|- What? - Do you want some beer?|- Of course! - Franz?|- I'm going to give it a try. - Your Eminence too?|- My pleasure, Majesty. Here it is, the majority|wants beer! I am curious|to know its taste! Excellent!|The pig foot is great... - Cheers!|- Cheers! Cheers! It is good! Not bad! Franz Karl! Bravo! I hope, Franz, this is|the unique surprise... and that you don't turn|our Viennese Court... into a brewery! Of course not, mom! A letter from Sissy. - What did she write?|- I don't know. I still didn't read it,|wait... "Dear mom and dad... after a long time, I drank beer and|I ate pig foot! It was wonderful!" - That I believe!|- "I immediately thought about dad... my missing raises|each day! Here I have everything, but|at the same time, anything". As she had said, she is arrested|in a gold cage! Was it a luck? The important thing is that|she loves Franz! And he loves her!|She says... "Franz turns any wish I have,|he carries me in his arms". Don't drink so much! You never carry me and|you are always complaining. I think everything is about the destiny.|Mine is to drink beer. Our Sissy destiny is|to become the Empress. But anything happens|for nothing... probably she has a|mission to accomplish! What is the|next audience? Count Andrassy! Get him in. - Count Julius Andrassy!|- Count Andrassy! I am glad to receive you. Get close. Majesty... my goal after|been amnestied... was to come before Your Majesty... to thank what Your Majesty|have done for Hungary. Get up, Count Andrassy. Who gave you the amnesty was the|Emperor. You must thank him. It is not about the amnesty|that I am talking. It is not it that brings the happiness|and the life to the ruined families. I'm talking about a heart that|beats for a nation. And I want to thank|this love. I will do everything I can|to make Hungary and Austria very close. And give the country back|to those that have the right. But these can be|only empty words. To prove my|good will... I want to invite you with the|Hungarian cortege to the ball. We will celebrate|with our hearts... the union between|our countries. - I am outraged!|- What did you say? - I am outraged!|- Why? That Elisabeth has|invited our enemy... that traitor, Andrassy! Come on... It is not easy to forget that|it was a Hungarian... who lifted a dagger|against my Franz. And now we can find him|unpunished among us! Highness, count Andrassy requests|the honor of being presented to you. Congratulations. I won't give my hand to a rebel,|even if he has been amnestied. Royal highness... how can I tell him that? In German or in Hungarian,|whatever! It's a pity the waltz is gonna be over.|I'll have to change you for another one. The Highness, Franz's mother,|offended us in public... She doesn't recognize our amnesty|and she considers us her enemies! Inadmissible. I think we must|leave the ball! I agree. You are the imperial couple guests|and not the Emperor's mother guests! It is all the same!|We don't accept this insult! - Let us put our ladies together!|- Sure. I'm sorry. Majesty, are you going to|shake hands with the guests? Majesty, excuse me, but do you|allow me to speak to you? - What happened?|- The Hungarian guests... got offended with the Royal|Highness Sofia... and they want to leave|the ball! The Royal Highness Sofia|offended us and... Andrassy wants us|to leave the ball! Majesty, the abandon of|the ball will mean... - a break in the peaceful relationships!|- But how can we avoid it? - Leave me alone.|- Majesty. What is going on, Sissy?|You look so pale. Franz, forgive me, but I will break|the ceremonial procedures... but I will do that for you|and for your country. What are you going to do? This is impossible,|Countess! But it is the expressed wish|of the Empress! Well... Gentlemen, the royal orders:|"the ladies choose". "The ladies choose"? - Was it you that ordered, Franz?|- No, I was me! Colonel? Tell to Count Andrassy|to dance with me. I am astonished! Is everybody here? Yes, but must we have|to say good-bye? No.|We must not. Count Andrassy, the Empress asks|your honor in the next dance. I think this Empress' choice... it more important than her|mother-in-law's offense. We should stay. Ask the Emperor|to dance with you. It's my pleasure. May I take you to the Empress? Please. Will you be there|without saying nothing? Mother, I don't know reasons|that made Sissy... to take this attitude, but I agree|with everything that she did! Majesty, may I have|the honor of this dance? It' my pleasure... - The ball is over for me!|- But why? My God! What was it?|An attack? The Empress fainted! - What does the doctor say?|- We don't know yet. - He is with her.|- Which would the reason? For sure one|she fell of the horse. I have been with her all the time. When she went to|Prater, you weren't! It can be appendicitis.|She already complained of pains. The reason of the indisposition... was the irritation with|her mother-in-law Sofia. Will We say to the Emperor that the|doctor is still with her? The Emperor should not|be disturbed. He meets with|the correspondent of Russia... and he is taking some serious decisions|that should lead us to a war. - Is the counselor still there?|- Yes, Your Highness. Am I very sick,|counselor? I don't think so, Majesty. But Your Majesty should quit|riding for a while. It is too bad... but it has to be this way. - Am I so bad?|- Bad, no, no... - But what is it?|- Good news! - No, it cannot be!|- Yes, Majesty! Mr. Doctor!|Doctor! It's very good, Doctor! What does it mean? Franz, I need|to talk to you now. Just a moment,|Excellency. What is going on, Sissy? - Franz...|- Yes? We are going to have a baby! Sissy! Is it true?|Is it really true? - Yes, get me down.|- Sissy. Don't press me! Don't press me.|We should be careful! - News!|- What is that? - Something very good!|- What happened? From Vienna,|from Sissy... - Is she gonna have a baby?!|- Exactly! Congratulations, grandpa. Mom! Mom! Is it true what|Thomas told us? That Sissy will have a|baby in Spring? He doesn't know|to keep a secret! It is true, soon you|will be uncles and aunties. Bravo! I will be an uncle! - And me an aunt!|- Me too? Everybody will be! Highness, I want to express|my happiness. I thank you very much, but now|bring a champagne, hurry up. Sure. It's enough for today.|Go to bed! Thomas! Please, Thomas, take the|the aunts and uncles with you. Come, children! Good night. It will be very good|it is a small heir boy! I would rather a girl|like Sissy. But I think|Franz would not! - I am so happy.|- So do I. The happiest days of the|life are like this... we are happy to see that|we are getting old. I still remember, as if it was yesterday,|that wonderful night... when which I got the biggest|present that the life gave me: Sissy. She was so pretty! - I was proud of her.|- Me too. And soon she will be|a proud mother! Is it a boy? It is a princess! I am very happy. You would be happier if it|had been a little prince. - I can't wait to see the baby!|- And I... Did I hear anything? My dear, here it is,|the little princess. She is like Sissy.|The eyes, the hair... Max, show her to me too.|Max, let me see her. Wait! The ears are also|like Sissy's ears! The two of them! Come on, don't drive me crazy!|Show me! Let me take her! Just a minute! I need|everything again very close! She is so cute! Isn't she pretty?|Like Sissy! - The forehead!|- Forehead? - What will be name?|- Sissy, of course! No! Franz and I already agreed,|if it were a boy it would be... Rudolph and if it were a girl, what I was|afraid of, the name would be Sofia! I hope everybody agree because|we didn't choose Ludovika. Of course not,|Ludovika is a bad name! - Sofia is bad too!|- He is right about that! - Since when you listen so well?|- Well, it was the labial reading. Fantastic! "You niece was baptized with|the name of Sofia, Anastacia... Amalia, Elizabeth, Francisca,|Stephanie, Carolina, Maria..." - All of that?|- Yes! - Do I need to remind all of them?|- No, just Sofia. The stork held little|Sofia so hard? - Yes, but she didn't feel anything!|- When the stork brought me... - I didn't feel either.|- I felt. "In a few days, dad and me|will be back. And I am happy since now|because we will be all together". Great! Till there we are going|to play Indian! Countess? - Isn't she sweet?|- Charming! Majesty, the visit to the|The children's Home! I am coming! The Empress! - Nurse. Nurse. Nurse.|- Majesty. - What noisy reception.|- Yes, it's really noisy. - How old are they?|- It varies a lot, from 2 to 7 months. A girl? - How much does she weigh?|- Two pounds and a half. She weights more than mine.|But mine is younger. Is he hungry?|I think he wants milk. He already had milk, Majesty. - Yes?|- Already! - Please, Majesty!|- He is screaming for screaming! Are you a baby girl?|Yes, no? But what a blondie. What about you?|What a nice sleepy. Is that a nice thumb? One more baby girl? - What about you? What is her name?|- Eva. She is tired. It's to bad the Emperor didn't come.|He loves kids like me! Where are you? At your desk for sure. - How are you here now?|- I went to the Children's Home. - Did you like it?|- It was great! So many kids, one more|beautiful than the other one! - Well, well, well!|- That's right! But anyone was so|beautiful like ours! Of course!|How was the place? Clean and beautiful. It could be a|a little more pleasant! A little dark,|the place needs sun. - I will do what is necessary for it!|- What about seeing our treasure? Lets go. Without noise, maybe she|is sleeping! What happened?|Where is the cradle? What is going on? I didn't know that mom was|going to make the change today... I was going to tell you tonight.|Mom decided to take care of the... education and formation of our|daughter. And to have her in a... bedroom next to her. And how can she decide|a thing like that? I can take care of my daughter!|I learned with my mom! - She raised eight children!|- She didn't want to offend you... and I was wrong not telling you|before, but with all those... receptions and trips, you won't have time|to take care of her. I will always have time for her!|I don't want anybody to take her from me. - Nobody will do that!|- No? She already did it! - Where are you going?|- To take my daughter! - Where is my daughter?|- In her bedroom. The next door. You cannot come in,|she is already sleeping. I want that my daughter's bedroom|to be changed again... where it was before. I already told you, you cannot come in.|She is sleeping. I won't wake up her.|Get out. She is under my custody. - But I am the mother!|- You are still a child... and you should relegate|her education to me. I will never let another person|to raise my daughter! I will educate my daughter|my way. For the last time,|let me go. Be reasonable.|Mom just wants the best. So are you on your mother's side?|Against me? I am seeing the things|from a neutral side. Are you against me|to educate the child? I already explained to you|the reasons. So I already know|what I should do. Sissy, wait! - Colonel.|- Yes, Majesty. I'm going to travel. Only you and the|Countess Bellegard will go with me. To your orders,|Majesty! - What is going on?|- Your Highness, I am shocked. The Empress left. - To where?|- We don't know. - Did she say goodbye to the Emperor?|- No, Royal Highness. Should I inform the Emperor|about what happened? No, I will inform him myself. I think we didn't|acted right. We should have leave the|little baby with Sissy. With a human being that|abandons us? She seems a disqualified|bourgeois wife. I let you know the risks|of this marriage. I ask you to stop with|these observations. Now are you against me too? It seems that you|have forgot that... since I married to Sissy,|I am happy. - Hurry up, a telegram.|- Did you come to Ischl? Yes, but only very fast.|Is there anybody here? - There is nobody.|- Who is inside three? Nobody. Every time you come here,|you make a mess! Mess? I am here|on a state business. How can we telegraph|to an Emperor? To who? Don't make so many|questions. Telegraph... "To Your Majesty,|Emperor of Austria. Sir..." No, no...|stop it! Stop it! "To the office of the Emperor of|Austria". This way is good. - You can telegraph.|- You drive me crazy! Well... "This has the intention|to inform Your Majesty"... No, no! It's terrible.|Stop, cut it. Come on, telegraph once since for all. What do you want|me to telegraph? The Empress is|on the way to..." "Possenhofen". Not so loud! My Sissy! I am so happy! It is a pleasure|to have you here. Come, hurry up,|the Empress. But tell me, why|didn't you bring the baby? Well, it is a very long trip. I see. And Franz,|why didn't he come? He had a lot of work.|I almost don't see him. But I am happy to be here.|I feel full of life. - Where is Papa?|- He went to the forest with the children. I can't believe|you are here. Let's go in and|make yourself comfortable. Seppl, look who is here. It's good to be here.|And Nene, where is she? With aunt Maria, in Potsdam. I can sleep in her bedroom? - Sleep in yours.|- Do I still have my bedroom? Well, anything has changed|in here. Come on. It was like this that I imagined|the Empress's castle would be. You are right, everything|is the same. - We even have flowers.|- I always leave them there. There it is, the last|book I read. I still remember it very well... - And here are your clothes.|- My dress! Even the same mess|is still here. You know, my treasure, I left the|things the way they were... because when I come into you bedroom,|what I do everyday... I have the feeling that|you are still with us. You have no idea how it's good|to feel that somebody loves me. But, Sissy, everybody loves you, and|the most important is Franz! Doesn't he carry you|on his arms? Yes, he satisfies all|my wishes. Are you living well with the Aunt Sofia?|I asked her to be nice with you. - We are understanding each other.|- Thank God! It makes me happy. It would be terrible for me|if it was different. Now put on your dress... I want to see you like you were before|being an Empress. The suitcases are already|in your bedroom. Blow it, so they will|that we are hungry! It's Max and the children. Her father! I think I heard your father's voice.|But where is he? There he is! - Dad!|- Sissy! - Slow down.|- Where is the Emperor? - And what about our niece?|- Did you bring her with you? - What a nice surprise.|- I'm glad because you are here. She is with us again! Did you see how the dress|fit her yet? She doesn't look|the Empress of Austria... she looks my little Sissy! Come with, I will show|you something. Why didn't Sissy|bring our niece? I want to meet her. She is very small,|she can't even can walk. I would carry her. Yes, but before you needs|to have a good soup. Come on! All my little birds. But I free them|before I go to Vienna. They came back.|Here they feel good. - Who feeds them?|- Me, of course. Do you think I would let|anybody else to do that? Do you know who came back too?|Your deer. Xavier? But you weren't here|and he ran away again. What is wrong, Sissy? You are so different. It is just your imagination. I know what you missed... the mountains,|the forest, isn't it? Maybe... So it was good to come. Do you want to come with me|go the hunt field? We have eight partridges. But|don't sneeze when I shoot. Like you did with Franz. Did he tell you that? Yes, then he didn't see|the prey anymore. - I swear I won't do anything.|- That's Ok. I knew it,|she went to Possenhofen! She will come back soon. No, I know her.|I will have to take her back. You should not leave in a|such critical moment... with so many important|decisions to make! Nothing is more important|than Sissy! I'm going to take her and|to give her a scolding. - Do you know how to catch a partridge?|- Of course. When it coos,|you must approach yourself... get stopped like a statue... And close your eyes|for not scaring it. I did nothing,|I just did like this. I'll never hunt with you anymore. Don't get mad,|it was so beautiful. - Let it coo.|- Perfect. Let it go. Ah, dad, it's very nice|to walk with you. I always remember what|you said once... "When you have problems,|go to walk through the forest". What?|What is wrong? Dad! What is that, Sissy? come on,|my daughter. Tell me! I didn't come here to visit you,|actually, I ran away from Vienna. My God, Sissy!|But why? I couldn't make it anymore. Aunt Sofia didn't stop|to bother me... she even took|my daughter away me. Sissy, you know that I am|always on your side... but you could not do|such a thing... after all, you are the|Empress of Austria. You should not leave|your country. What did you say to mom|about that? She still doesn't know.|She was so happy... that I didn't want|to hurt her. Don't tell her anything,|maybe things get better. Well, if you want this way... Which is the favorite dish|of the princess... Princess?! I say, of the Empress? - Ham-meatballs.|- Meatballs. I will make them. Nobody makes meatballs|better than Your Highness. Ask to Walpurga|to prepare everything. - Hello, Max!|- Hello. What's wrong with you? With me?|Nothing... There is something.|What bug did bite you? Any bug bit me. Forget it, be not with|that face. Sissy told me. - What did she tell you?|- What happened to the partridge! Well, Max, forget it... Is it another thing? I know you and|I know that there is something else. There is nothing, only|the meatballs that I will eat. Come on,|the meatballs? Highness, His Majesty,|the Emperor of Austria. The Emperor? Please, receive him,|I need to change myself. - You were never like that.|- I'll tell you later. You are very strange today. Greetings, dear aunt. I'm so happy! First Sissy|and now you! I could not come before, but for sure|you were waiting for my visit. No, Sissy said that|you were too busy. Yes, but to solve this situation|is much more important. - What situation?|- Sissy has run away from me. - She what?|- Didn't she tell you? Not a word. Why did she run away? The old same story, she doesn't feel|comfortable with my mother. And my mother doesn't treat her|the way she should. But this wasn't the|reason for the runaway. You are right... I see. But tell me, what was the reason|that made Sissy to runaway from you? I agreed that mom|should raise the child. - What?|- It seemed to be the best solution. - Did you take Sissy's daughter off?|- Yes, we changed the bedroom... And you think it is weird|that she has run away? She should have cared for|the image of the Empire. It is the last important, when|it means to assure that... a mother keeps her daughter.|Any woman would act like this. Franz, you will never|understand that... but believe me, every mother would|agree with Sissy. How did he know?|Was it you. No, it was colonel Bckl.|He telegraphed to Vienna. - So it was that.|- Very well. If he didn't know where you are,|he could not follow you. He recognized the|mistake he made. - You should be kind with him.|- Me? Never! I will put everything that I held|so far out. You will reconquer Sissy if|you do not reprehend her. I'm sorry, but I will tell|her everything that... There she comes. I am so happy to|have you again. - What about our little one?|- She is doing fine. - Did she gain weight?|- A half pound. - Is she liking milk?|- She is loving it. I know that I hurt your feeling,|I'm very sorry. Me to.|I was such a fool. But now everything|is gonna be Ok. - Everything will be the way you want.|- No, the way you want. Was it you who telegraphed to Vienna? Because you did it very well. Because it was almost a heroic action. A... a... heroic action? - We will not go back right now.|- What do you mean? You need to know|your country... Karnten, Steiermark! And for not missing|your mountains... I'm going to show you ours!|- Great. Do you know where|we're going to start from? - From Tirol!|- That's fantastic. This is too beautiful! I have never|seen something like that before. So? Is it not too beautiful? There below, it is the|city of Innsbruck! That big mountain|is Habicht! Will I have to climb the|mountain riding this animal? - It's very tiresome for you.|- For me? When I was... a child I always climbed mountains.|My father used to say: Any mountain is too high and|any way is too narrow! Do you see that cross? Pay attention. I'm going to show you something! - Sissy, no! You are not wearing boots.|- I don't need boots! Look out, Majesty! Look out, Majesty. She is killing me... pardon me!|That Empress is of killing! - Franz! See, deer!|- I'm coming. Hell! He going|to go up too! You climb as well as I do! - Where are the deer?|- There! Can you see them? Look, so many! Do you see that? Amazing! But now it is winding a lot. That means that... - there is an Alps flower.|- Where? - On the scarps! I'm going to take it.|- It's dangerous! Franz! Look out. - What is he doing?|- He's going to pick the Alps flower. - Is he still there?|- Yes, for a while. I caught it. I'm going! I was afraid for you!|Thank you. - I think it's coming a storm.|- But the sky is so blue! The weather here changes fast.|See how the clouds are moving. Guide, is there an inn|close to here? Yes, the only problem is that the|innkeeper will be sad. If he knew... that Your Majesty would come,|he would make a better dinner. - We won't say who we are.|- We will eat what it has. That's it, Majesty! We used to stay in places like that|when we did long trips. I used to played the zither.|But not like that. Thank you. Watch out, he can|make a mistake again! - Did you hear that?|- No. Hey hunter, look at that. - It smells good! Is there any ham?|- It is inside. - What about the dishes?|- Eat it in the bowl. What do you drink? - A glass of milk.|- We don't have it. The goat didn't come. The idiot is hiding! The goat didn't come. It went up the|hill! That idiot! And it disappeared. - What else do you have to drink?|- "Red" and "Burned"! I would like to drink "red",|but I don't know what it is! Don't you understand the language of|your people? What a ashamed. "Red" is red wine,|"burned" is dry wine. - Please, a "red" one.|- And a "burned" one. - Do you have a gentian?|- I can handle it! Bring it, please.|You will already be assisted. - So? Are you satisfied?|- Not totally. - Could we stay here a few days?|- To stay here? - It would be good.|- There is a hut over there. - You only need to clean it up.|- It's Ok. We will clean it up. When I was going to with my father|we used to stay in huts like that. - I used to make the breakfast myself.|- I heard that you are a great housekeeper. That too! Majesty?|The storm is over. - Is it over?|- Yes. - That was so fast.|- Look, the rainbow! - Where?|- There! Ah, I saw it! Sorry, Majesty, but the guide|says we have to go back right now... - before it gets dark.|- You will go back with him. We'll stay... - here for a few days.|- What? In the middle of nowhere? Get us everything what is necessary. And guarantee that nobody|disturb us. - But here there is no water!|- But here there is the "red" one. Drink a lot to tolerate|the way back. Cheers, Majesty. Majesty. What? Are you crazy?|We are incognito! - No formalities.|- Right. - So, are you going?|- Yes. Then good-bye! Did you hear? Good-bye. - Good-bye.|- Good-bye! I am so happy to stay here,|to live like ordinary people! I'm so happy! And tomorrow we'll wake up very early.|It's when the weather gets more beatiful. I know. Are you happy? - Come here outside, it snowed!|- It snowed? - Ouch, in the middle of the summer!|- I never saw anything like that! - I believe you.|- Let's make a snow battle. - The agitate of the clouds.|- It's amazing! Magnificent. I always wanted it was like that,|far away from the occupations of the... Empire, of the politics! And we do not|be the emperor and the empress. Just a simple housekeeper? My God, I still have|so much work! - For what is this spit?|- You do like this. It was Thomas... who taught me, the more|you spit, the more the boots shine. - I think we must not tell it to my mom.|- Sure! It will be our secret. What happened in|our absence? The news about your departure left|agitated all the population of Vienna. - I already expected that.|- They are talking about a total... misunderstanding between you|and the Royal Highness Sofia. What did you do stop|these rumors? Such rumors will only stop if|you present yourself in public... with the two|supreme ladies. You are right. I think that the things|are not doing fine. We will know it tomorrow in the reception|of the Hungarian cortege. I swore that the Empress|would come by herself. Shut up! Everything was not but mean rumors|and groundless. - Did you talk to your mother?|- Yes, but without success. I knew that nothing|was gonna change. She threatened to leave the castle... if she had to abdicate|the child's education. - And what did you say?|- I didn1 t know what to say. So I will tell you: she is, but I go,|and forever. Did you forget how we were|happy these days? No, I didn't forget, but I think|that our destiny... it is be unhappy...|forever. Is the suitcase already ready? - Not yet.|- So, hurry up. - These too?|- Yes, and the pink too. Did you came to Vienna... to give me a lesson? No, Sofia. I came to talk to you. I came to talk from|mother to mother! Look, Sofia,|I didn't forget about our childhood. And nobody knows|as well as I do... that you are human being and|it was the life and the politics... that turned you in a cold person. You spent your life fighting for a|goal, for a son. You did everything did for your son to be|happy, you even refused the throne. That's why you should not|refuse to give him the biggest thing... a true love of a wife! Sissy loves your Franz! And you should be grateful for that.|Am I not right? Ludovika... Don't think that I don't like Sissy,|that I don't know her tastes. And I didn't assume the child's education|to harm Sissy. I assumed it for thinking|Sissy is still a child... and the women of our age|can educate better. But a son|belongs to the mother! And an empress|belongs to the emperor! Franz will travel for the whole Empire|and Sissy needs to follow him... she can't stay here|taking care of a child. But it is possible|to conciliate both of them. Sofia, I ask you... Be conscious and|do not make mistakes! Sissy, you cannot do|it to me. Now I need to put all my forces|together and concentrate myself. Nicolau wants to force me to make|a war and I don't want it. France wants to involve me in a|war. I need you, Sissy. I need your help! Your advices! See the Hungarians case! Your|understanding, your affection... were more powerful than|all my generals! Without you, there is no a reconciliation.|I won't be crowned the king of Hungary. You only talk about coronations and wars,|but never about our daughter! You only see me as an empress|and never as a mother! No, Sissy! You need to know what is|more important to your country. - What is it?|- The General-attached asked to... remind you about the reception of the|Hungarian cortege within half hour. Say that I am already going. Sissy, get ready soon. I am not in conditions|to receive nobody. There is no chance! You know what this|reception means? For me it means nothing. You are the empress from Austria!|Don't forget it! Sorry, but it is time. See you later. Farewell. Majesty... the suitcases are ready.|When do you intend to leave? In a little while. Now leave me alone. I just get knowing|that the Empress... won't participate of the|reception and she will leave. It's impossible!|It must be a rumor! Her ordinance informed me.|It seems that there was another... argument between her and the Royal|Highness for the child's protection. I should speak with|the empress! - And how will you do that?|- I'll go to her facilities. Take me to her facilities. - But just like that? Without an audience?|- I should take a risk, there are a lot... of things involved.|Show me the way. Sorry to bother you,|the count Andrassy is here. - Is the count here?|- Yes. He asked you for an audience. Have you informed him that I do not|want to receive anybody? - Yes, but he insists.|- Let him in. The Empress will receive you. Sorry to disturb you|so abruptly. But I just was informed that|you won't go to the reception. - I have my reasons.|- I am sure that your... reasons are plausible. But|I ask you to leave them aside. It's impossible. Since the generation of Maria Teresa,|the Hungarian people are waiting... for a member of the Imperial House,|who is trustful... someone the people|could live and could die for! And we are here to speak with|that member, our future queen! Although it is a very hard bale,|we ask you to go to the reception. Count Andrassy, do not insist.|I can not go. - Mother!|- My Sissy. What should I do?|What should I do? You should not let your|husband down, especially... knowing that he loves you.|You have a duty... be strong and surpass|to yourself. - Is she coming?|- No. - Baron, is everybody ready?|- Only the Empress is not. It seems that she won't take|part of the reception. - Any other orders, Majesty?|- No. I'm happy you are here. And I am happy to give you some|news that will make you happy. Mom accepted the idea that|the child belongs to the mother. - Franz! Is that true?|- Yes, it is! She even already provided the|changing of the child's room. - Who ordered it?|- The Royal Highness! Sofia, I don't believe|that you did it. His Majesty, the Emperor!|Her Majesty, the Empress! I salute the Hungarian people|representatives... and I welcome you|to Vienna! Majesty. The Hungarian people... that I have the honor|to speak in their name... express the wish... that Your Majesty|attend the coronation. And at the same date Her Majesty|will be crowned the queen of Hungary. I will correspond to this wish... because it happens to be|my wish too. And I thank God... that gave me a woman... with the sacred gift to... conquer everybody's heart. Now I ask the Empress,|that before the Hungarian people... to answer to your question. It is with lots of happiness that I|accept your wishes and that you take to... the Hungarian people my sincere thanks|and my greetings. I wait anxious for a|trip to Hungary! Friends, from Hungarian|regions came... representatives bringing|a little bit of ground... to create a hill as|a symbol of confidence... in the new queen and|that God protects her... and protects our land,|the beloved Hungary. How big is this country! Big|enough to get to the sky. Till our beloved God. And you have conquered|this huge country! Only with the heart. What huge flocks of oxen.|It's like the Dr. Falk's portraits. Franz, look at that! So many geese! Here comes the Empress!|Come on! Hurry up! I swear before God|Almighty... to protect Hungary|from its enemies... if they come from north, south,|east or west. I promise as queen|of Hungary... to respect the laws|and the duties... that unite me to|this people... in name of this union... I will do my best to|make the people happy.
