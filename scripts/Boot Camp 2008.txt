Here's a list of allergies and things he can't eat. Crystal Kid. Excellent. Excuse me. Can I help you? Uhhuh. I was in here last week. I bought this. You said it was new. When I opened it, it was scratched. Well, if it was sealed when you bought it... You probably shrink-wrapped it yourself, you needledick! This place is a fraud, okay? You don't wanna buy anything here! I'm a little upset... - Take the register. That's enough. This way. Let's go. Needledick? Shut up. Like you didn't like it. - Maybe for two seconds, but I work here. I need this job. - Mmhmm. So are you coming to Liddy's party tonight? I don't think so. Well, I'll be there. It'll be fun. All right. I'll meet you there at, what, 9:00? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Another satisfied customer. Mmm. I'm gonna pay for this all week. Ladies... Tadah! Okay, who's drinking what? I'l have a scotch, please. For you, Bob? Taking the high road... Listen, the three strikes law works. Drugs are a plague on society. If you can keep the criminals off the streets, it's good for everyone. Amen to that. You know there were 2 million incarcerations last year? We've got to be doing something right. Uh, excuse me, Karl? How many strikes am I up to now? Is there something you want, Sophie? You know, what concerns me more than drugs is the plague of corrupt politicians. Were you looking for this, Karl? No? Sorry, everyone. Mom? Anyone? Sophie hasn't been herself lately. Come with me, honey. - You know, I don't understand why you have to search my goddamn room every single time. - Sophie, that is enough! What? No? What is wrong with you? What, Karl? Huh? Three strikes and I'm out? You ran out of strikes a long time ago, lady. Hey, where's Sophie? Uh, late. # I want to love you # In my room # I want to take off # All your clothes # I want to see you in the daytime # I want to see you in my room # I want to have you # When the sun shines # In between the blinds # So fine do it here in the daytime What, what, what? Okay... I'm sorry. It's okay... It's okay... I can... It's torture, but, uh... I can wait. - Oh, thanks. Hey, what's this? - It's nothing. What is it? - Nothing. I swear. It's nothing. I just, uh... Karl and my mom just raided my room again. It got a little heated, that's all. You like to mess with him, don't you? No. No, I don't. Will you do something for me? Yeah, sure. Anything. What? Marry me. Hehheh. Yeah, okay... This must be good weed. No, no, no, no. Look at me. Seriously. I looked into this. I don't have to be 18 to legally be married in Nevada. I can finally get away from Karl and my mom and you and I can just be together. Please. My dad left us a trust fund, okay? We can use it while you go to college. Whoa, slow down. You don't wanna marry me? - No, it's not that. It's not that I don't want to marry you or... Okay, if we ever do get married, it can't be for legal reasons. It's got to be just about us. You know, like, you, me... love. Okay. Sophie Bauer? Who the hell are you? Hey! We have parental consent to take you. Get off me! Consent, my ass! Get the fuck off of me! We can do this the easy way or the hard way! Ben! Sophie! Ben! Okay, kid, you asked for it. Ben! Sophie! She needed help, Ben. Where the hell is she? - She's away, and no one can see her. - For how long? Perhaps a year. It's part of the program. A year? The program? Your own daughter? What have you done? She was hurting herself. Destroying our family. It had to stop. You're wasting your time and ours. Why don't you just go? - Screw you. I told her to take it easy on you, but she was right. You're a prick. All right, kid. I'm calling the police if you're not off this property in 20 seconds. Is this really what you want? Hey! Where are you taking us? Hey?! Hello?! They won't answer you. Where are we? Fiji. Where the hell is Fiji? Oh, fuck... Hey! It'll be all right. Let's go! Everybody, get off the boat. Hurry! Move it! It's a long hike. - Okay! Let's go, let's go! Let go of me. Let's go, let's go. Come on! Come on, get up! Ow! Goddamn! You - Bitch! Get off! You dick. Keep moving. Come on, get up. Come on, come on, let's go! Move it! Wilcox, Jack. Portland. Excuse me, why are we even standing? Is your name Jack? - No. Then shut up! Wilcox, Jack! Cold turkey's on the menu here, boy. Hope you got an appetite. Randall, Daniel. Chicago. Quiet type, huh? Bauer, Sophie. Denver. Okay, so since you know who we are, who the fuck... Argh! Get off of me! My name's Logan. I'm in charge of security here. You'll come to appreciate me in due time. This isn't a prison camp. You'll notice that there are no walls here. We don't need them. If you leave the camp's perimeter, your sensors will tell us. And if you think you can swim for it, take a look around. You're on an island, surrounded by ocean, surrounded by more ocean. And if the undertow doesn't get you, the sharks will. Take off any jewelry or personal belongings. Let's go! You'll get it back. Well... now we're gonna educate you on how to be strong and how to follow the rules. The faster you learn, the sooner you can go home. In the meantime, enjoy your stay. Oh, my God! What the fuck? You're kidding, right? I mean, we can't stay out here all night! You a good swimmer, Jack? Ah...! Ah! Each morning when the sun rises, this land is the first place on Earth to receive its rejuvenating rays. We are truly blessed, and for that we should give thanks. I'm Dr. Arthur Hail, founder and director of Camp Serenity. Please come and join me. Faggot. Jack, right? Jack, we don't allow those kind of words within the camp grounds. What grounds? We're on a beach in the middle of fucking nowhere! It wasn't a very friendly welcome! Chaining us to cement blocks and nearly half drowned! Each one of you have emotionally, psychologically, and even physically kept your parents chained to a block of concrete day and night for years now. So we think it's only fair to let our newcomers experience what it feels like to be in your parents' shoes, if only for one night. Come along now. You can now count yourself as proud members of ASAP. Advanced Serenity Achievement Program, created by me to help troubled teens as yourself to avoid the negative patterns in our society that can destroy your ambitions, your education, your families, their future. You sick freak! What the hell is this shit?! Hey! You motherfucker! What the Argh! Taste that, huh?! - Ah...! Huh? Go on, have a good taste! Get up! You're coming with me. Here, in this beautiful, serene environment, those sensors and these boundaries symbolize a conflict with the world. You can have all the freedom you want. It's all here for you. Accessible. At the same time, it's all out there, in your everyday world. The program requires discipline, dedication and some hard work. As young Jack just displayed, some of my new admissions can't help but to give in to rage. We're not here to deny your feelings, rather to explore and examine them and hopefully express them in a more constructive manner. And I will help each one of you to achieve your goals. This is where our adventure begins. And here we have Ellen, one of our finest members. She will get you settled in. Follow me. Everyone starts as a black shirt. It symbolizes your confused emotional state. As you work the program, you progress, first to yellow and then to white, like me. If you work the program, it will work for you. The program must've really worked for you. Hey, how'd they suck you in? Bribed by Twinkies? I'm going home in two months. The only way you're gonna get out of here is with a white shirt and a smaller chip on your shoulder. Let's go. Have a seat, Wilcox. Trina! Done! Show Sophie your space. Randall! Inside. You okay? Our world isn't exactly designed for your comfort, you know? It's either this, the floor, or the cement blocks on the beach. Hurry up. Let's go. Come on. It's weird, huh? Looking at those clothes and thinking about the ones you used to wear back in your neighbourhood? I had some real nice stuff. But now it's just the same old shit every day. Well, I highly doubt she came here in a hot little party dress. No. Sweat suit and about 30 pounds heavier. Like, a real fat ass? Skinny little bitches like you used to make fun of me all the time. So I was a cutter. No one makes fun of me anymore. So... who's our new arrival? Miss Hail, this is Sophie Bauer. Welcome... Sophie. Hail? - Dr. Hail's sister. Let's get you ready for your BCS. BCS? Body cavity search. Just in case you're concealing any Twinkies? Sorry for being so late, Ben. Thanks for coming. Thank you, Mrs. Bauer. Have you heard from her? No. But you've got to stop calling the house. Is that why you asked me here? It won't do you any good. If you care about my daughter, you won't pursue this. I don't believe this is what you wanted. I can appreciate your feelings, but I know what's best for her. Do you know how much she needs you? Ever since her father died, you're all she has. Me? Yeah. Maybe it's not my place to say, but she thinks you don't care. I mean... the only thing that matters to you is this Karl. You're right, Ben. It's not your place. Mrs. Bauer, she means so much to me. Is she at least safe? There's a camp. Serenity Something or Other. It's in the South Pacific. They're gonna help her, Ben. Thank you. Really too late to call So we wait for Morning to wake you It's all we got - Ben! To know me as hardly golden Marry me. Is to know me all wrong At every occasion I'll be ready for a funeral So, what, they don't work? They're just making sure we don't steal shit. Hmm. So the inmates are running this, huh? Hail gives them a little more power, a little more freedom, extra food... It seems to work. Yeah, I don't know. I think I'd rather be hungry. Thanks, though. Jesus Christ. How can they get away with this? I don't want to do this. A clear conscience is to your soul what good health is to your body. You agree? Trina's been with us for 6 weeks now. She's from New York. This is her first session. So give her your support. Why are you here, Trina? I don't know. She don't know. So you have nothing to tell us? You can tell us why you're here, can't you? You have nothing to confess, nothing to say? No? You can say it out loud. You can say it to us. Come clean. Just say it. I don't know, sir. Honestly. I'm very disappointed in you, Trina. I thought it was time for you to advance. Me! Me!... Gildner! Foster! Madison! Murphy! You sucked dick for money, didn't you? To buy drugs, you sucked dick, didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't you?! That's all you are, a filthy whore. A little junkie whore! You stole, didn't you? Did you steal from your mother? No! - Bitch! Did you? You turned their life into hell! Bitch! - Junkie! Did you? Liar! Liar! No! Stop! You go live with my parents! With their religious Jesus bullshit! Their Bible and their curfews! I couldn't take it anymore! I just couldn't! I made a bet with my friends, you know. See who could do the most guys. That night. And I went for it. I really went for it. I slept with... ...seven... ...7 or 8. And every time, I wished that they could see me. And it made me feel so damn good to see how much it would hurt them! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. We love you, Trina. We love you. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us... God, give us the serenity to accept what we cannot change, the courage to change what should be changed, and the wisdom to know the difference. Hook me up. Hey, Ben? You pick up Dad's cleaning? I forgot. I'm busy. Hey, what's all the excitement? It's chicken. Once a month. But there won't be any left for us. Oh, Trina... Trina, Trina... It's just a piece of chicken, Logan. You know the rules here. Right? Why should you get an extra piece of chicken and no one else? What makes you so goddamn special? I'm not special. You know that this could... ...keep you a black shirt forever? I can't. You know, I was ready to recommend that we move you up. Unless... Unless, of course, you want to make a deal. Hmm? I can't. Please. Please. No... It's terrible out there. Oh, it's not so bad. Come on! Quick! Get out! Everybody, out! Look at them, the way they react. Shouldn't we help them? Be my guest. Let's all move inside! Trina's still in there! Trina! Trina, come on! Trina! Trina, come on! Get up! Girls, here! Now! I'm in charge of work detail today. We're rebuilding these tents. What about the boys? Hey, it ain't my logic. We just do the work and get it done. That's it. All right! Let's go! Come on! Excuse me. Come on! Take the bottom! Okay, now take the back. Okay, pick it up. Pick it up! What are you doing? Resting? Get up! Get going! Trina, I'm tired, okay? Trina, please just stop. I get it, okay? Just let me rest. You're not the only one who's tired. Get up! Please just let me rest for one second. Get up, rich girl! Keep going! I'm really, really tired... If you don't work, we all get punished. We have to learn to work together. Don't make me do this. Go ahead. Too soon. I don't think so. Come on. Ahhh! Come on! Kick her! - Please, I can't! Kick her! Kick her! Okay, so maybe I was wrong. Every time we give these kids the proper incentive, they will rise to the occasion. Liar! Liar!... How long have you been hooked? A couple of months. That girl out there, she's in rough shape. - I'll be the judge of that. Their files. Sorry for the inconvenience. With the storm, we're rebuilding. I will never forget the day I climbed on top of that sand dune and I saw this old, broken down service camp for the first time. Well, lucky me. Just imagine, if you hadn't, I'd be home with my boyfriend right now. You see, all around us is a protected area. The Fijians found an ancient civilization here. A well organized society. Can you imagine? Cookies and milk? Come on. You've got to be kidding. Okay... So what's the big idea? The idea? I'll give you one cookie. In return, you open up and tell me all your deep, dark secrets. Well, here's a deep, dark secret for you, Doc. I hate cookies. All right, then. Let's get started. You hate cookies, you don't care about ancient civilizations, you have a boyfriend back home... ...and you hate your mother. No, I don't. She hates you. What loving mother and father would send My father's dead. Karl is not my father. All right, then. What loving mother would sign over the care of her only daughter to a monster like me? Okay, listen, Dr. Shrink, I don't know what your game is, but I'm not playing it. You might have all these monkeys believing that you're some kind of leader and healer of this grand Utopian society, but I have to tell you something. I'm not buying it. So you know what? Have your milk, and I hope you choke on your cookies. Roberts. Gibson. Richards. Hey, fuckstick! I'm talkin' to you. You got something to say? Let me tell you how things work around here. Jack... it's your time. We're about to eat. Well, enjoy your cookie. Everyone else, get your asses to dinner! Ben... Look, I have so many things I have to tell I know. How did you get here? They're going to help her, Ben. Where is it, jackass?! Henry, he's killing him! Do something! You touch that phone, he's dead. He's a maniac! You better give me that money by Monday! I'll handle it. - What do you owe money for? It was the only way to make them believe this was all real. You... It's only saline solution. I just burst a couple of blood vessels. We're gonna get out of here. All right? Okay. Okay. Move it! Back to camp! Come on! Let's go! You wanna be strong?! Yes, sir! Let's see some balls! Come on! Let's go, ladies! Come on, move it! Come on, Richards! What are you doing?! Get up! Don't pussy out on me! All right, ladies! Do you want to be strong? Yes, sir! Do you want to get off this fucking island? Yes, sir! Get in the water, ladies. - Yes, sir! Let's go! Move it! Come on, you little fishies! Let's go. Get up! You're weak, Randall! Head home, ladies! I have an announcement to make. For her hard work and team spirit, Trina has been awarded a yellow shirt. You should all keep up the good work. It's the only way to get home. I'm very proud of you, Trina. Stop jerking off! Let's go! Go, Sophie! Sophie's been with us for over a month now. You're wasting your time. I got nothing to say. That's fine. Let me say a few words anyway. Sophie's a... young, beautiful woman. She's smart, doesn't like cookies... ...and she has some unresolved issues... ...with her dead father. Would you like to tell us about it? No? Anybody else? Me! Me!... Foster! Get up! You little bitch! She's a pathological liar. You think you're better than everyone else! Tell them it's a lie! Stupid liar! Nobody loves you! Liar! Liar!... Stupid bitch! - You little bitch! Get out! Get out now! Now! Say it, huh? Say it! You think you're better than everybody else. Don't you? You know that! Stop! I'm sorry! Excuse me, I really want to apologize for the scene I caused earlier. I shouldn't have acted that way in front of Karl and my mother. It's just that I've been in a highly agitated emotional state. You see, ever since Karl married my mom, he's been coming into my bedroom every night forcing me to have sex with him. You little bitch! Tell them it's a lie! I lied, okay? I lied. I'm sorry. It's just me. I got a plan. We're gonna get out of here. There's no way out. I got it all set up. Trust me. Look, I lied, okay? I fucking lied. I am ashamed and I am humiliated. And if I didn't fuck up, neither you nor I would I don't care! Forget it! We all make mistakes. I'm not gonna make one by letting you stay here. Hail said this is a good place. Maybe this is the right place for me. Hail doesn't know what he's talking about. He's not even a real doctor. He got his PhD on the Internet. - Okay, okay... I'm sorry. You're right. I don't know. I'm sorry. I gotta go. Sophie... Today, I want you to write an imaginary letter. To who? To you. From your parents. I want you to write the letter you'd like to receive from your parents if they could write to you here. What do you think your parents would tell you? Dig into your psyches. It's a good exercise. You better focus, unless you want to stay here overnight. Now! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! In two months, it could be me on that boat. I can't imagine being here for two years. It's like a lifetime. It's been the most important and fulfilling two years of my life. Hut! Stay down, pretty boy. Easy, Jack. It's just touch. Yeah. You need to cool it. You gonna cry now? Let's go. Line up! You wanna piss off Jack? Lateral it back to me, then go long. Got it? - Got it. Okay, watch your man! Yeah... All right! Watch him! - Let's do this! Go! Go! Get him, get him! He's going deep! - Fuck! Get back in there! Move! 1024 is cleared and secure. All right, let's play ball. 349! Hut! Hut! Too rough for you, pretty boy? What's wrong? Can't breathe? Stay down. Nick is leaving us after two years. He's another great example that our program can reform even the toughest case. I'm so proud of him and his achievements, that I'm gonna bring him with me to my seminar in Los Angeles. Are you ready to put the past behind you and forgive your parents? Yes. I thank you for that, sir. I know exactly what to do with my life now. We have all given him the tools to achieve this great leap forward. We gotta get out of here. Remember how you said you had a plan? Okay, I'll tell you when. We should probably do it when Hail's out of town. "Dearest Danny, "if you get this letter, it means it's a fake, "because we would've never written to you, not in a million years." Yeah, I know. We're not getting through to him. Not yet. Next. "My sweetest girl, "I've been dead for a few years now, "but I know you'd rather hear from me "than anyone living, "because no matter what you do, I'll always support you. "Don't judge your mother too harshly. She loves you dearly and is doing her best." Sounds like the beginning of a breakthrough? I don't think so. She's too smart a girl. Just trying to curry favour, manipulate me somehow. You kind of set the program up that way. Thank you for the insight, Rhonda. I know how much you resent the parents, but most of them have tried their best. Every time you go back, it takes such a heavy toll on you. What's the matter with you? The seminars are a crucial part of my program. Educating the parents is as vital as educating the students. Don't you forget. I just worry. The court cleared us, you remember? But if that girl hadn't died... We wouldn't be here? She did. Just worry about our children. Come on, come on... Come on... We go tonight. - What? I'll pick you up. Let's go. Where are we going? The main island. There's a resort. Please settle into your seats. No taking no notes, recording, photographs, cell phones. Thank you, and welcome. The Advanced Serenity Achievement Program, created by me, was designed to give you back your lives, and to ensure a positive future for your sons and daughters. And I'm very grateful, because you have trusted me with your children. Now it's time to make sure that you can be trusted when they return back home. You see, your children work hard at Camp Serenity. But they can't return to the same home environment from which they left. And it's important you remember now that you share equal responsibility for the state that they were in when they first came to me. When did you first realize that you couldn't trust Ben? It was only a short while ago. Frankly, it came out of nowhere. That's why it was so painful for us. He told us that his girlfriend dumped him. Sophie. That's right. He took it real hard, and before that, we never had any problems. Ben convinced us your program would help him. I understand. Come on! What happened? Ben! Ben, what's going on? Ben! Hang on! We have a reservation, under my name. Is room 14 ready? Oh, my God! Oh, you're a fucking genius! Shhshhshh. No, no, that's great. That's absolutely perfect, thank you. Plane leaves tomorrow morning. What do you want to do till then? Strange are the things That draw me to you Do me a favour Once in a while Young love... What a wonderful sight. Remember it. Welcome back. Ben and Sophie betrayed us all. In the world we live in, the actions of one person affect the lives of others. It's time you understood your responsibility towards other people. We will all have to pay for Ben and Sophie's selfish behaviour. So for the next three months, no breakfast and no time off. You're dismissed. Awesome. I hate breakfast anyway. You fucking watch yourself. Good morning, son. Come on, Danny, save yourself. From who? I made a mistake. Why do I have to be held responsible for my parents' denial and paranoia? Danny, you can't shift the blame of your behaviour. I accept no blame. I don't recognize my parents' right to put me here. I don't recognize the legal system that allows you to keep me here until I'm And I certainly don't recognize your fucking credentials! Do you recognize you were gonna kill your family?! Parents, friends, your teacher! Huh?! Murderer! Murderer!... Murderer! I would never murder anyone. I created... a character... ...to piss off my parents. You created your own world, didn't you? Misunderstood doctor who cares only for broken children? Teach me. Come on, Doctor! Teach me, Doctor! Show me where I went wrong! Nooo...! Liar! - No...! All right, Romeo. Let's go. Hail's waiting for you. You weren't hard to find. How's that? - It's a small island. We knew you stole that fishing boat. Pretty stupid. You didn't try to stop me. What for? What would you have learned? No, you had to go through it. In order to end up back here? Why did you come here, Ben? I think by now it's pretty obvious. Love? Admirable. But you decided to express that love by almost drowning Sophie, destroying whatever progress she'd made so far, subjecting her to humiliation, only to end up in your present state of mind. Was it worth it, Ben? What? Going through this whole charade. You sacrificed your relationship with your own family and jeopardized the progress of every kid in my program just for your own personal desire. What now? You gonna send me home? Yes. No. There's a plane leaving the main island on Thursday. So in three days, I'll be free of you, and you of us. If you step out of line, I'm gonna make Sophie's life a living hell. Hey. What's wrong? Nothing. Ben. Ben! What if Hail's right? What are you talking about? I shouldn't have come here. It made things worse. What? I almost got you killed out there. We could've died. So? Hey, listen... At least we tried, right? The only way for you to survive here is to be part of the program. Me? What? You just said the only way for me to survive here... Ben? Ben, what's this really about? He's sending me home. Listen, you can't leave me after all we've been through. Say you want me. Say it. Say it. Huh? I've seen the way you look at me. No. - Yeah. I know you want me. No, we had a deal. Listen, I make the deals, slut! No! Stop! Stop it! No! No! Stop! No! No...! Ahhh! No! Shut up. No! Shut up! I knew you wanted it. Jesus, Trina, what happened? Get out of here! Jesus Christ, Trina. What happened to you? No! Get out of here! Leave me alone! I swear on my father's grave, I won't say a word. What happened? He promised me he'd help me if I... He raped me, Sophie. He raped me. Oh, my God, Trina. Trina... I'm so sorry. And now... he's gonna be the asshole I remember forever. Come on. Rule number one! Obey the rules, sir! Number two! Discipline, sir! Number three! Leadership, sir! All right, you know the drill! Ben! What are you doing, Randall?! Let go of that buoy! Come into shore now, goddammit! What are you doing?! Help him! - What the fuck are you doing?! He's drowning! He can't swim! - Hang on. I got him. Come on, Danny! Come on! Get off him! Get out of here! You don't know what you're doing! Come on, breathe! Breathe! Come on, Danny! You killed him. You fucking killed him. He was trying to escape. Of course he was! No, he wasn't! It was bullshit! You killed him! He couldn't fucking swim! We all know that! He was waiting for his opportunity and was gonna make a break for it. You saw it! - I didn't fucking see him! I tried to get to him! You killed him! He was trying to escape! Don't you fucking defy me! You back down unless you want to spend two weeks in that fucking hole! Yes, sir? All right, let's take him back. He drowned trying to escape. You got him? Yes, sir. What happened? What's going on over there? I don't know. Did you see? You ruined everything that I've been working towards. There will be an investigation and civil suits. I don't see how I can keep you on here, Logan. You can't run this camp without me. I can do whatever I want. Don't you think the U.S. Army would like to know where you've been the last couple of years? One call. That's all. So what should I tell them? Who's that? The kids. My kids. You see, they won't let us get away with this. And I certainly won't take a hit for you. What do you want me to do, sir? Don't say a word until I tell you. That's all. You're dismissed. - Yes, sir. Not a word. Why not? You see what's happening? You're losing control, just like before. You're trying to play God, and the harder you try to hold on, the faster it's gonna fall apart. Just like before! Shut up. He's graduating early after all. Could he swim? - I don't know. Thank you, Dr. Hail. As you know, we've had a tragedy. Danny Randall was fighting his own demons, and today they won. I feel the same pain losing Danny as I would losing my own son. I devoted my whole life to prove that if we work together, we can reach a common good. And there's not one person in this room who could honestly say that I haven't given my heart and soul to each and every one of you. This is bullshit. I want you all to know that here at Camp Serenity, justice works for everybody. It's equal for all. It's time for Logan to atone for his sins. Atone for my sins... In front of all these spoiled little brats? All right. Let's go. Say it, Logan! You killed Danny. Fucking say it! Danny, when he was drowning, that little guy had to dig down deep to find the will to live. Unfortunately, you know what he found? Nothing. What are you all afraid of? Hmm? Hmm? What are you afraid of? How many other girls did you promise a yellow shirt to, Logan? What's that, Trina? How many other girls did you promise a yellow shirt to, Logan? Yeah. How many? How many, huh? Tell us. How many, huh? How many? You were willing to do anything for that yellow shirt. We made a deal. It's really simple. A deal? - Yeah. Really? - Yeah. Was rape a part of that deal? I gave this slut what - She's a fucking child! You raped her. And then you killed Danny. She's a kid! Look at her! Stop it! Stop! If we do this, we belong here! You belong here because your parents have given up on you. You realize that our parents pay him to take responsibility for us? I don't mind. Take a look around you. You come here broken and I put you back together. And I've saved thousands of children! Yeah? What about the girl who died in your camp in New Mexico? Yeah. And God knows how many more. Is that why we're on an island halfway across the world with less rights than prisoners on death row? Who says we need to be torn down, tortured, humiliated, in order to find the greater good within ourselves? Who decided that makes us better people? Who?! - Yeah! Who? Who?! Shut up! That's enough, Ben. Yeah, you're right. That is enough. This system does not work. It never has. It never will. If we don't stop it, right now, tonight, then Danny will have died for nothing! We can't let that happen! Come on! Come on! Grab those. Come on! We've got to call for help. They're completely out of control. What have you done, Arthur? I'm not going to let them destroy my camp. Let's go. We gotta stop this. Ben, do you realize that by your actions here tonight, you've completely justified my method? Frightened parents will always need to find a way to deal with out of control kids like you. What are you gonna do now? Shoot us? Perverted piece of shit! Jack, no! Ben?! One way or another, this had to end, Arthur. We'll see what the authorities have to say. You know how it goes, Dr. Hail. Full circle. That's it.
