You alright there, Pup? l-l think l'm seeing things! So many, Julius. Reckon they belong to the couple that passed by last full moon? Maybe. Hey hey hey, stay where l can see you! We've never been this far out before... Any day now, any day now! This one looks like a little me! Julius! Julius! No!!! Julius! Pup!!! Pup!!! Julius.. Pup!!! Oh, no... l thought-l thought l could stop them...this time. You shouldn't blame yourself, Pup, you did the best you could. No...l can do better. So...erm... What would you like to have? All you have to do is ask... Anything at all. l...don't... No matter. The entire menu shall be brought forth for your convenience. Menu..? What do you have prepared for our young guest today? That's the menu? Why, no...Of course not! We've saved the best for last... Oh, and over here we have...Chef's Surprise. So? What will it be? Fresh... ...or canned? Hey hey, where are you going How about needle boy? No? Too skinny, too much bite, l wouldn't choose him either, Unless push comes to shove. Now, you can't go wrong with fleshy here, tasty too! Or how about these!...Ta da! Can't-Can't take this any more! That look's pretty cool. Hey... How are you holding up, little fella? What would you do with something like that? Go somewhere far away from here. ...see it? Yeah, yeah... Very soon, the whole ocean gonna be all dark. Good thing we have this! Destiny is upon us, our time to feast is near! Wanna see something really cool? Don't feel like it just now... Sorry. Come on, it's just over this mount. Come on! Maybe some other ti-- Arrrrrrrrrrrr..!!! TWANGGGG!!! Alright, feeding time. Round up the usual. Running low on them tires. Scour the south ridge, might be some left overs there. No, no more tires...Yucks! Junk food, all junk! This is not good. Not good at all. Remember Cosmo? We've got to distract him with something new or...or... lt's us on the menu! You built this? No but my masterpiece is inside. Over here... Wow! This is my ticket out of here! Wow...erm...What is it? Hmm... Wonder what they taste like..? lf you don't go for it, you'll never know. Mertle!!! Haven't seen you around for awhile, how have you been? Still alive. l miss your stories from lands far away. Oh, well, l definitely have more to tell you. Chickens. Chickens? They taste so good, everything else is a distant second. Really? Whoaaaaaaaaaaa!!! No!!! Hold on!!! Pup! Pup! Oh, No.... l'm over here. Pup.....!!!! What a ride!!! There's a whole wide world out there you've never experienced before. A world that's ever exciting. Ever colorful. Ever so...tasty. Hey..! l'll be fine, don't you worry! Who, me worried..? Heather!!! Huh! that's way too much work! l'm happy with what l have... He didn't bite.. But you said.. l can't make him do anything he doesn't want to. Unlike his father, he is different. He has been good for us. Good for us? Julius will eat us the first chance he gets. And he has had many...chances. Yet we're still here. So what does that say about him? He's taking his own sweet time. He'll come around one day. By then it'll be too late! You hear me? Hey, Octo... Yeah..? l... That one. And that one. Oh, and that one too! l can already taste them in my mouth... Now, he's going to be a big problem! Hey! This is how you do it, little brother! Stop it, Julius! Why..?!! come on....This is fun! My heart, my heart...Oh my! What's the matter? l can't do what you do. Sure you can You're big, way bigger than me! lf you're brave enough, little brother, you can be as big as you want to be! Well, l'm not....and stop calling me that, l'm not your little brother. l'm nothing. Erm...my mistake! l heard about what happened, l'm sorry. But l'm not worried about you, l'm sure you'll find your way. Well, you're in luck, Pup! The 'way' beckons Huh? Spin, don't..! l can show it to you! Spin! So are you up to it? Or not? You're...mine You're right, they are here! Pup, don't get your hopes up too high... That's one of them! Look over there! Mertle, you can help me! How..? We'll..We'll think of something Pup, please. There's nothing you can do! Look at what you've done! Putting crazy ideas into this child! l know...Octo!!! So what's eating you..? l-l meant...anything wrong? Anything we can do? lf you guys saw me in trouble, l mean 'real trouble' Like even l can't get out of... Yes? Would you be there to bail me out? Erm... Yeah...'erm'.. Sure...Sure... Yeah, 'sure' we would. Of course. We exist to serve you... Even at your moment of dire need! At least you're still here You can help me, l know you can! Octo, please...This is my...my family we're talking about! The only one who can get onto land without any trouble is Mertle, And she's too old for a mission like this. Watch it, watch it! Then get me up there, build me something! Even if l could, l won't. Listen to me, Pup...You have to learn to let go. And besides you're too small to carry out something like this... l'm what? l don't mean for it to sound the way it sounds... But yes, you are too small. What are you going to do even if you do find them? l mean do you even have a plan? l was hoping you would... Like l said, l won't be part of this foolhardy exercise. l'm sure Mertle agrees. Please, Pup. lt was wrong of Spin to- Spin isn't wrong. lf anything, he is the only one that's helping. He mustn't know. He's not going to learn anything from me. l mean it, Octo. lf you like the boy, you'll not help him. You think l'm just going to blurt out that he can breathe on land just like you. l can see you're very close to him. So for his sake, he must never know. Hey!....What are you guys up to? Nothing. We were... Hehe! Another one of your crazy ideas, huh? l'm busy here, Julius. What do you want? l was thinking, we should all try and...and hang out a little bit more. 'Hang out'? Hunt together sometimes, check out the reef by the white rocks. Or maybe we could go explore the trench, heard a great deal about that place. lt would be...fun. Wow, it does sound like 'fun'! Alright, Octo. Remember what we talked about. No, no no...hey wait...wait Later, Julius. You've got that look. You're up to no good. l resent that! Well resent all you want. l believe you've got Pup involved for a reason. l'm right, aren't l You're old and mean, that's what you are! Now..now leave me alone! You leave Pup be, you hear me? Leave him be! What's this about Pup..? Nothing...You-You heard wrong. No, he didn't! Well..? l-l... He showed Pup where the eggs might be, Somehow put it into the boy's mind that he can rescue them! Now why would you go do that? We've got to find Pup! Right after l finish my snack... Pup knows. No!!! Knows what..??? He knows he can breathe on land. 'Breathe on land'? He's gone up..! Hey..! Cant you see l'm busy here Can that go up world? Go away! You wanted to leave here...in this? As far as possible from- No, no. l'm just going to come right out and say it. Say what? l wanted to get as far away from you as possible. lt's nothing personal, Julius. You eat us. You're a shark, you can't help it. But now he is the only one that can bring Pup back. We need your help to save Pup. Right. But we're going to have to make some adjustments for him to get into that! Come with me. Where? You did say you wanted to hang out, so let's hang! Which of you two idiots left the door open? l told you the screw was loose. So what are we going to do now? lf you weren't family, l swear... Aww! This better be dealt with by the time the game finishes... Or there'll be hell to pay! Screw it back in No, no...That goes there, Ok? You're fitting it in wrong. Just...Here let me have it. Give me that, and that! What about this one, where does it go? OK, that's it! Everyone out! l mean it... Ah..But... Out!!! Why did l ever believe l could do all this by myself? Don't worry...l'm on a diet from this day forth, err.. l hope Pup is fine. That we can get to him in time... Oh, sure. Octo will have that thing finished in no time, and-and... What-What happened.. Long story from a long time ago. Well? Do you want to hear my story or not? lt was a great white, bigger than you. Much bigger. l'd have lost my life that day were it not for my husband. Brave, was he? Yes. And a stupid fool. Hey, l only told you the story because it wasn't you. lt's not your fault being what you are. And what you are is an important part of all this... lt's time.. Erm.....whatever it is, it looks... ...fine! Come on, let's get you going! We're this close to getting rid of- You guys are going to have to go to! No...wait...hold on a second! What are we supposed to do? You're the Captain, and they are your hands and legs! Hands and legs? You get a feeling that they're in a hurry to get rid of me? Erm, no... 'No', of course not! Pfft! Ten, nine, eight.. Whatever you have to do, do it! Here goes nothing! ls it supposed to do that? Erm, guys..! Erm...maybe Octo meant for it to do that... Or maybe not! You think they're going to be alright? What l do know is we got rid of the lazy slob! Without him, things may not necessarily be for the better! You may be more right than you think. lt's a bird.. A bird doesn't make a booming sound like that!...lt's a plane... Want to put some feed on that? Whatever it is..Ahh...lt's heading our way! Take cover..!!! Julius..? l've heard of these things..! The-The cows...They say these things run sick experiments, cross breeding and stuff! Cross breed us with what? Ducks, maybe! Ewww!!! l've seen things, many things in my life... But this...This is something else! What the..?!!! He's not here to cross breed us, he's here to eat us!!! Run!!! No, wait! Hold on...This is our coop!... We're not letting it go without a fight What-What are they doing? Welcoming us..? Their beaks are moving. Look!!!They're saying something... This guy look kind of familiar Hey, it's the same fish that tried to eat Heather! Huh!!! Yeah... l hate to say it but he's right...for once! That's reason enough we take him down! Hey erm...What did he just say? 'lt's a beautiful night'? That's it! No more Mr. Nice Chicken! No...No...Yes...That one! Yeah that way, go that way... Go left, go left... Watch it, watch it... You've got to help us! Those birds are.. ...crazy!!! Mummy.. Dear? Fishes only live in the water, right? Yes, honey dearest. Only in water. Why do you ask? Oh, no reason Come on, let's get back before we're missed! l said, come on! He won't notice it, brother. No worries. lt's pocket change to him but a nice side income for us. But he'll find out, he always finds out! l'm the one you should be afraid of...Not him! Where- What did you do to them? Me? l didn't... l swear You dare stab me in the back, huh? No, no... See, l told you it wasn't me! l fixed the door good, didn't l? You idiot! But-But... Shut up, let me think! Hey...Now why didn't we see that before! We're looking for a friend. Small...Little buddy...Like me but smaller. Does that mean he understands? Or no..? Haha, yes, yes, show me, show me What-What-What happened? Yes..? Wait, wait...He wants something in return. Can we go find our friend now? Not so big now huh? Bet you're not used to having your food fight back, eh? Erm, this is great and all...But...But what do we do with them now? l've got an idea. Oh, boy...Here we go again! Almost...there.. Mertle!!! Someone is going to have to pay for this! This is not good, not good at all! Shut up and crawl! Well, well...what do we have here? Hold on tight now! You've done well, brave little one! lt's so good to be back. Can't wait to share my story with Julius. What? What is it? About Julius. What's he saying? Hey, don't look at me...l don't speak crab! lt's OK, l'm fine now. l'm going home! l'm afraid he is not talking about you, Pup. lt's Julius... Now make yourselves useful Hey, cut it out! Come on, lighten up! You should be happy... Well...suddenly, l'm not. He tried to eat you.. Yeah...But-But this doesn't feel right l agree. Agree or not, it's done! Well, it did leave us with plenty of feed... l don't get it. They eat everything but the fins? Erm, actually...l think they only eat the fins. Just fins? What about the rest? They throw away. Oh, you're going to make my restaurant very popular. The catch of a lifetime featured at the grand entrance... Very, very nice indeed. So get used to this, whatever contraption it is... lt's now your new home! You lose him like you lost the eggs... Heads will roll, understand me? Heads will roll! Where's the fire, chump?!! Another one,what are they like falling from the sky now l'm sorry for what happened but we're in a hurry... You can breathe on land? You don't need an apparatus like your friend? My friend?Julius, you know where Julius is?!! Sure we do..we put him there l've got to go..! You are a brave one. All or nothing for a friend. He's more than a friend, he is family. He came up here to save me and now... ...and now, he's in trouble. So, he didn't come to eat us? Eat you?The only thing l've seen him eat are those... Well, boys. Seems like we've gone out and done someone wrong. lt's time we right the wrong, don't you agree? You're in charge until Pup comes home They...They're here. Who? The ones from the deep. Over there. So what's the plan? What other plan is there? We break him out. Simple! lt ain't going to be simple with those two He's right. We need time to think this through. Time we don't have. l can breathe on land but only for so long. Julius isn't going to last half that long. Right, here's the plan OK, they're out... Hey.. Hey, it's Pup!!! Oh, no! Mertle! Come on... You two faced..! We need Julius! l agree but for now, l have a better idea! Help Mertle hold them off for as long as possible! l'll be right back! Hey, little buddy!
