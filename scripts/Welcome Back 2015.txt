"Everybody let's have some fun." "Everybody let's Welcome back." I'm sure you recognized them. "Go explain him... who Uday Shetty really is." "What his true colors are?" "Control." "And the things he can do if he blows his cool." "I do have a gun." I'll blast few rounds under his ear lobes.. That he'll be dancing before the horse himself. 'You guessed it right.' 'They are underworld Dons Uday Shetty and Majnu bhai.' 'There was a time when they ruled this city.' 'But look at them now.' 'They are getting swindled out of their own money.' 'Why?' 'Because these yesteryear goons... have turned white-collared now.' - Uday! - I don't get it at all. Where's the money? Who let you in here? Snake, water and Basha Khan can get in anywhere. So which one are you? Do I look like a snake or water? I am Basha Khan. I own everything that moves in Dubai. And you two are running such a big hotel. Did you load the guns in your mind, boss? - Yes. - Don't fire them. So... will you pay up or do I raze down this hotel? Bloody... walking balloon. You'll raze down my hotel? Yes! Control, Majnu... Control! What control? Now these toads are croaking at us. Majnu, we've been blessed with everything. Fame, Fortune... Respect. And respected men are helpless. They have to pay HP- Mannu. - Yes, boss. Go quench his thirst. Yes, boss. Go. Come, Basha bhai. Uday... you're the smarter of the two, so explain him as well. My feet are down there... not here. - What did you say? - Nothing... I don't remember. - He's a mirror of our past. - What? Not you... Go on! Come, Basha sir. The sweets are this way. He's an ugly image of our past. This is exactly how we were. We would simply pickup the phone and.. "Send 20 million... Send 40 million.." Doesn't it feel much better to lead a respectable life? You're right, boss. Since you turned descent, a lot of people respect you. Right, boss? But earlier everyone would respect him. Right, boss? That wasn't respect, it was fear. Right, boss. Fear is better than this decency. Right, boss. What's all this? Can't you all stick to one thing? Why are you confusing me? They can't confuse you. You've been confused for the last seven years yourself.. Whether you did the right thing by turning decent. Right... we are confused. Not us... only you. I am clear... that I am wrong. I am still within my limits because of your decency. Otherwise... l would've made my own Al-Qaidas. "There's another problem in their life." "These two poor guys are still unmarried." "They couldn't get married yet." There's not a single female in their home. Boss, if there's nothing more to do, can we go home? You never stay when there is something to do. - Go. - Thanks. No need to go anywhere. Boss, it's 'Karvachauth' today. Our poor wives must be waiting for us. How would these two poor guys know about wives, 'Karvachauth'.. Home or Children. Love you, son.. I'll get you the chocolate... l promise. Even the toys. I'll get everything. Boss, the children are giving you love. Boss, we'll have to go. Yes, we have to. Let's go. They are all married. Look at this fatso. When he's sitting, he looks like a big sofa. And this baldy. His wife doesn't have to wait for the moon to rise. Even I've a big desire.. That someone looks at me from the other side of the strainer. Yes, that's true. But wives are a peculiar puzzle. They trouble their husband all year and make his life hell. And by performing such rituals... they don't let them die either. Regardless... we should get married. Yes, of course we should. But you see... our good-looks interfere with our destiny. Lord must be confused... about the kind of girl He has to make for us. "But one day... Lord sent a dame in their life... clad in a two-piece." "And it was love at first sight, for these two... with the same gal." "But she is no ordinary girl." "She is Princess Chandni." And this is the website from where the princess was downloaded. "I mean her mom..." "Queen Padmavati" of Nazabgarh. "But do you know why they are here?" So... after we get out, we've to lure their kids. They are the targets. Look at his face... And this one isn't even worth a look. Mr. Gill's seen their hotels. They are filthily rich. This time we'll be posing as Queen and Princess. Why is that? The rich get credit easily. Sometimes we'll borrow from them... other times they can give it as gifts. But what if they seriously come after me for marriage. I didn't get married yet, how can I let you do it? But... they look like tough nuts to crack. Can we break them? Not just break them dear, they will melt away. They will melt away. Both the rascals are eager to get married. And after all, you're my daughter. In just two meetings... you'll turn them into Ranbir Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor. "Tell me baby now..." "what's the reason that you sound." "What's the reason that you sound like my dream guy." "And your ways just feels like wow!" "I feel relieved... every time you're close to me." "Every time you're close... my passion soars." "So why don't you meet me really soon." "Baby... meet me daily." "Life's so lonely." "Baby... meet me daily." "You've stolen my heart." "Baby... meet me daily." "Life's so lonely." "Baby... meet me daily." "You've stolen my heart." "O Baby... O Baby... 0 Baby..." Mom, I want this car. Such a beautiful car. That we can't afford. Love you. "You stole my heart in a second." "Now you seem important than the rest." "Important than the rest..." "Important than the rest..." "Important than the rest..." "You stole my heart in a second." "Now you seem important than the rest." "You know how incomplete I am without you." "Distances are not good in love." "Why do you meet me only on weekends." "Baby... meet me daily." "Life's so lonely." "Baby... meet me daily." "You've stolen my heart." "Baby... meet me daily." "Life's so lonely." "Baby... meet me daily." "You've stolen my heart." "O Baby... O Baby... 0 Baby..." Mom... I don't like a single ring here. - How about this one? - "Baby... meet me daily." "Life's so lonely." Majnu, your heart is bigger than this ring. My love. Brother. Brother. Why are you prancing around like a horse? I've wonderful news. - What happened? - I've decided to get married. Congratulations... - Me too. - What? - With whom? - Yes... with the princess. - Princess? - Hmmmm. But I love the princess. - Ignorant fool... she loves me. - I see. - Let's go ask her whom she loves. - Come on. Madam, both the ATMs are here. What? You love Uday and Majnu? Dear, we belong to the Nazabgarh aristocracy. And we don't fall in love so easily. And your heart's... beating for two? What else can I do, mom? Whenever I close my eyes I see Uday. And when I open them I see Majnu. And most importantly... Uday's such an experienced actor. "Potatoes...!" "Onions...!" And the other one... is a magnificent painter. "When I'm holding a brush, I don't hold a gun." So, mom... Can I many them both? What? You're choosing a companion not buying a cooking-gas. More the merrier doesn't apply here. I feel... you should let them decide. Whosoever horoscope matches the most... will marry you. Wow... what a decision. - Priest.. - Yes. I hope my celestial merits are enough? Even if they're not, I'll take some from Majnu's horoscope. You do that. Otherwise... it won't take long for this scene to turn bloody. And I have the quality to do that. Do all my merits match with the princess? All 38. But there are only 36, Yes. But seeing the way you cut that watermelon.. I was going to say 40. You fool, you stick to 36. And don't forget... Knives can take lives as well. Priest... look at the horoscopes... and stop dreaming. Uday! Father, Hello. You're angry with me, aren't you? What are you doing here? I hid something from you till now. You know that I got married twice. I'm a little tensed, just need to speak for a minute. Go ahead, we don't understand a thing anyway. Why did you grow a beard? You look cheap. Your hairstyles really nice. This is not some style, I lost most of my hair. Because of you. Is that so? I can understand, I'm going to lose some more hair. I mean I got married thrice an not twice. And I have another daughter, which means your sister. What... three marriages? Sister. I have no sister. Get lost. Uncle! What new problem did you cook-up now? Majnu, you know that I got married twice. But actually I got married thrice. Three? Children are crying out for food.. And father's finished his 3 course-meal. And I have a daughter. Daughter? - You mean another sister. - Yes. People normally get sc But in this case your own father's sc you. Well... there's no guarantee of this father now. My life-switch can turn-off any minute. Are you my father or a ceiling fan? On-off? What's wrong with you? My motor's damaged... Heart. Just like you got Sanjana married in a decent family.. I want you to do the same with Ranjana. That's all I do. You keep getting yourselves a new wife every time. And we find grooms for our sisters. I don't have any sister. But I have a brother. I thought he'll be overjoyed to see me. Hug me.. I didn't know he'll refuse to accept me. On every 'Raksha Bandhan'.. I would see my friend's brothers and wish that I had a brother too. But when I found out that I do.. I left my exams in-between to meet him. Now I've met him. I guess I'm not destined for any brotherly love. Why not? I am there. I always wished that... I had a sister. And I've found her today. You're my sister... not his. I'll get you married. Majnu! Let it be, brother. It's not her fault. - It's... - I admit it's my fault. Come. Uday, you're exactly like me. Emotional rascal. Now I can happily go on my pilgrimage. Sunder Shetty... now you can get married again. Now I can happily return India and give my exams. Your happiness is going to double-up. Soon you'll have a sister-in-law as well. - My wife. - Or mine. - Only one of us... - Is getting married. This marriage isn't possible, I mean... only until your sister doesn't get married. But what's our marriage got to do with hers? Yes, mom. - Dear, you're forgetting who we are. - Who? The Queen and Princess of Nazabgarh. How can the brothers get married.. When their sister's still unmarried? What will the people of Nazabgarh say? Yes... what will they say? - How can we find a decent guy so soon? - Yes. What's the hurry? Take your time. Your sister's not in a hurry nor are we. But we are. Look, call it our helplessness or our condition. But we cannot ignore our tradition and customs. Let's go, dear. Boss, don't fire. - Control, Uday. - What control? Where will we find a decent boy from a respectable family? - I will kill you today! - Ghunghroo! Have you gone crazy? You never let me stay normal. You were already married prior to our marriage. And you also have a son. And you hid this from me until now. I was going to tell you on our wedding night.. But you fell asleep after drinking the milk. I was only asleep, not dead. You could've told me the next day, you wretch. I tried to tell you, but you never gave me a chance. Did you expect me to call a press-conference to disclose this? You should be happy that you're a son. My Son? I didn't cast my vote... so how can he be my Chief Minister. What's the point of killing you? You can be happy with your son? I will renounce this world. Ghunghroo... you don't have to punish yourself for my mistakes. You know we couldn't beget a child even after numerous efforts. Lot of people called you uncle.. But no one called you papa. Daddy... papa. You're very lucky, Ghunghroo. Not many fathers get a young-grownup son. No hassles of dropping or picking up from school. No college... no donations. Direct son. And what about when you're dead? Who will perform your final rites? You'll wander around as a ghost. And if your son performs your final rites... you'll get salvation. He isn't just your son, he's a boon for us. Say something, Ghoongroo! Say something. Take me to my son. - Take me to my son. - Ghoongroo! Hello. Hello, Ghoongroo sir. We paid a visit to your home.. And found out that you're heading towards the airport. And so we thought we'll seize on you on the way. Seize. What a great thought. By the way... where are you headed? India, to see our son. What? Son? - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - You have a son? - Yes, our son. - Your son? - More than a son. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Wait! You never told us you had a son. What do you mean by we didn't. I've a paternal and a maternal uncle as well. I never told you about them either. He lives in India. We hardly meet him. So what is all the questions for? No... no... don't get angry. - Is he a bachelor? - Is he? You don't know whether he's a bachelor or not? I said he is a bachelor? You think I am being rhetorical. He's a bachelor... - Congratulations! - Congratulations! That's exactly why we were coming to see you, Ghunghroo, So that you tell us of a decent boy in your family.. And we get our sister married to him. Sister? You never told me you've another sister. - You didn't know either. - Not me, it's his. I mean... mine too. His kid sister. Probably... the last one. With the grace of God I've everything. Fame, Fortune... Respect. And thanks to my father... I've three mothers. - Three mothers? - Yes. Since we'll be related soon.. There's no point in hiding it from you. I've a kid sister from the third mother. Great... he's got a sister. - You don't look surprised? - Why should I? It happens with everyone. Some suddenly finds a sister.. And some find a son, right. She's really cute, cultured, decent and beautiful. All I want is that you accept her as your daughter-in-law. Consider it done, Uday. It's a yes. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Hold on. - Let me meet my son once. - What? I mean... you meet my son once. What's to see? Father's like sugar-cane... so the son must be like jiggery. Hey... Can't you can give a decent example? Then you give one. We're standing at the threshold of the temple.. Then we're bound to find God Inside. We know you, there's no need to see your son. We can have no second thoughts.. About a respectable, decent and handsome man like you. - Listen to me.. - We can talk later. It's a yes from us. Yes. Rascals... congratulate them now. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! Come on... it's Ajju bhai's birthday. Come on, aunty... pay up. Stop. Stop. It's Ajju bhai's birthday. He's here... he's here... Another one.. Why are you begging? We're collecting donation. It's the same thing, only different spelling. Why are you collecting donation? It's Ajju bhai's birthday. - Birthday? - Yes. I've heard about Gandhi Jayanti... Ambedkar Jayanti. Was your bhai some freedom fighter? Yes, he's a freedom fighter. He fights wherever he gets freedom. Come on, pay "P- Stop arguing, just pay them. - Fine... 11 rupees. - Not 11 rupees... we want 11,000. 11,000? Did your mother or your father leave that kind of money with me? Hey... Maybe you don't know who I am. Hey lady... you don't know who Ajju bhai is. Look. Turn around. Ajju bhai.. Ajju bhai.. Ajju bhai.. Ajju bhai.. "I am a stormy soda." "I am the queen of carom." "I am a spicy fritter." "Makes your mouth water." "I am a match a stick." "That can light a wet cigarette." "Even rowdy's get sentimental for me." "I became Bubli and you became Bunty." "And we played 20-20 in a closed room." "I became Bubli and you became Bunty." "And we played 20-20 in a closed room." "Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.." "Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.." "I've been fleeced by beautiful damsels..." "by their black tresses, and rosy cheeks." "I've been fleeced by beautiful damsels..." "by their black tresses, and rosy cheeks." "Shiny... shiny... shiny... shining queen." "Queen." "Luscious... luscious... luscious is your youth." "Youth." "As the veil slips down my body." "There's a chaos in neighborhood." "You're the bell that I keep ringing." "I became Bubli and you became Bunty." "And we played 20-20 in a closed room." "You became Bubli and I became Bunty." "And we played 20-20 in a closed room." He's played enough 20-20, daddy. Yeah. Now slice his body into 50-50 and end this match. "Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.." "I've been fleeced by beautiful damsels..." "by their black tresses, and rosy cheeks." "I became Bubli and you became Bunty." "And we played 20-20 in a closed room." "Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.." "Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.." "Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.." "Fleece me... Fleece me... Fleece me.." Aslam. Take my father inside. Uncle, go that way... No, not that way. Dr. Ghunghroo is Ajju's father? - Aslam, run. - Come... come.. Kill them both. I am not Tipu Sultan. I don't know how to use this. Give me a shield to protect myself. Let's go. Come on. No - Ghunghroo! "Here he comes." 'H. "Here he comes." 'H. Catch him. Catch him. Oh my God! "Here he comes." 'H. "Here he comes." 'H. Mister, why don't you do something? Me? You're the police. What do you expect? Do you wish to see me in my grave next? If these two leave, this city will be in a much better condition. - Who? - First is Ajju. - And the other? - Ajju as well. He's a big menace. "Here he comes." 'H. "Here he comes." 'H. "Here he comes." 'H 'H. - Hey no! - Ajju bhai. Ghunghroo. 'H. Ghunghroo. - Ghunghroo, are you still alive. - Ba - Ghunghroo? - Get lost you, b Stop messing with my brain. Don't make my temperature soar. Ghunghroo, what's wrong with your language. - Yeah! I spent only 12 hours with him, and I'm already sounding like him. This... pound of flesh will get me salvation. What kind of boon did you bless me with, Lord? Uday and Majnu have turned decent. I cannot cheat them. I will tell them the truth. Quiet! How dare you hide such a big truth? All the marriage preparations are done.. And now you cheat us. Why didn't you tell us? I told the biggest lie ever. I was supposed to get a Red bridal dress for your sister.. But I got Maroon instead. A bride's dress is always Red. Didn't anyone tell you? Mister... save me please. These guys have been playing me non-stop for the past 8 hours. My condition is worse than... Iraq. But... why you dancing? This is my punishment. Punishment. They want me to keep dancing and enjoy the beating session. I am enjoying getting beaten up. If I had danced so much in a dance-bar.. I would've made millions. Majnu, don't beat him. Don't.. Don't forget that you guys have become decent now. We've turned decent doesn't mean anyone can cheat us. Where are you going? What would Uday say? Uday sir couldn't see all this. Yes. That's why he already left. See... Yes, we did. But the boss said we should disrobe him completely. And leave only his underwear. Why only underwear? Its better you beat me instead. Beat him... and take his underwear as well. Beat him. I don't even wear underwear. Uncle... those rascals even took my underwear. How will I go home now? Forget about you, I am wondering how I'll live in this city. Did you hide a truth as well? Keep it concealed. Don't disclose it... otherwise two people can adjust behind one radio. What do I hide and what do I disclose? These rascals haven't reformed yet. At first they were only rascals. But now... they've become bloody rascals. I don't know what to do. - You're still a bachelor, right? - How do you know? Your personality. Why? What's wrong with me? Tell me... if I send your picture to some girl.. Will she say yes for marriage? Never. She would rather choose to die. Right... l knew it. I knew it. Don't... If you move the radio, it will tune to a different channel. And I'll be humiliated. I will avenge your humiliation. Me. HOW? I'll send your picture instead of my son to their sister. So that she breaks-off this marriage. They use their hands and feet a lot, even bullets.. But they can't rack their brains like me. They will come personally to break off their sister's marriage. And I will humiliate them in a way they've never been humiliated before. Very good, uncle. Insult them so bad that even the ipod can't hide their shame. Come on, son. There. Take shots from different angles, uncle. - No... one is enough. - Okay. I just need to break-off this relation, not kill the girl. - One's enough. - Okay. Ready? How is it? Amazing. You look uglier in the picture. My mother used to say the same thing. Show me. Look. Hey... I think he's dead. Death without underwear, oh God. Look at the boy they chose for me. Quickly say no to your brothers. He'll feel bad if I say it over the phone. I'll be seeing him after the exams. I'll explain him them. Sheetal, what's all this? Rose... greeting card? Seems like someone's blindly in love with you. I can't say whether he's blind.. But, he's definitely deaf and dumb. Either flowers... or cards. And if I don't take it, he resorts to hooliganism. And today he's crossed all limits. He's invited me to watch a movie together. He's made my life hell. Sheetal... relax. I'll teach that roadside-romeo a lesson. I'll decently explain him what does he think my friend is. If he teases you again, I'll cut off his legs. Just tell me where I can find him. See those guys sitting there. It's the boy in blue shirt. Wait her, I'll talk to him in his language. "Here comes... Ajju bhai." Javed... go get tea for everyone. "Here comes... Ajju bhai." You go. And stop making gestures. Go on. - Boss, you make a dumb guy talk too much. - That's how I am. - How are you sweetheart? - Rascal. What's all this? Bhai... its love. Love. Shut up, rascals. I don't like this cheekiness. First you flirt with some girl... Then you follow her... And then write love-letters. I can see myself falling in love.. Only when some girl walks up to me herself. She stands before me in style, stares into my eyes and says... "I Love You." Wow, boss... amazing. Bhai, she's dumb. And deaf too. Damn.. Bhai... she's saying "I Love You". I Love You? PVR Cinema... Sunday 12 to 3. We'll also see the film if we get the time. Bhai, she's asking for a reply. - So fast. - I know. She's saying if you don't reply, she'll cut off your legs. Bhai, did you see the way you gave the flower? Who will give a flower to you? Quiet! This is for bhai... from sister-in-law. Bhai, this is a flower... not a knife. Hold it like this. Bhai, men always look for a wife that speaks less. But thankfully sister-in-law's completely mute. Yes, bhai. And there's a lot of similarity between the two of you. You never listen... and she'll never hear anyone. Right, Javed. Since bhai's fallen in love, you seem uncomfortable. Shut up. Bhai... why are you so quiet? What do I say? When she was trying to gesture her feelings.. It felt like someone was.. Firing at me with a AK-47 fitted with a silencer. No sound... no bullets fired... but my heart's been shot. Boss... phone. "Majnu..." Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, how are you? Why $0 quiet? What are you looking at? Last night... I had an overheated discussion.. About your love with my heart. And in the morning... you two won. You're sentenced to love for life under section love. I have decided... that I will marry you. Really? Did you two hear? Yes. - I am the prince of Najabgarh now. I won! I won! Majnu's out. The real Majnu (ROMEO) never got his Laila (JULIET).. So how can this Majnu. Correct. This is going to be fun. - Go and give this good news to Uday. - No! - You won't do anything like that. - Why? Why? Your friend loves me a lot. What if this news shocks him to death? I know you're a very nice man. And you wouldn't want your friend, who's like a brother to you, to die. He's right. - That's fine, but.. - What about our marriage? What about our marriage? Leave that to me. I know it's a bit difficult, but I'll explain him. But for my sake, you will never let him find out about our relation. You've gone crazy in love. How could you forget, that our only ancestral manor in Nazabgarh.. Is on the verge of being auctioned? How will I get 20 million to save it? "Majnu..." "Laila..." Come on. Only 20 million. Tell the queen she'll get her 20 million in 30 minutes. - Tell her. - Only 20 million. No need to worry. - Lawyer... - Cheque book's ready. How sweet of you. You've such a big heart. I did the right thing by choosing you as my life-partner. I love you my love. I love you too, baby. - I love you too.. - Boss. Why did you bring me here, Ranjana? I want to see what a big lover is he? Whether he comes here even after I warned him yesterday. "Here he comes... Ajju bhai." - Ticket. - Don't want it. I am asking for your ticket. Give him the ticket. Why you.. Enough... let's go. I only asked for a ticket, but you guys gave me the monthly pass instead. What? 17 guns? And adding these 3 makes it 20. But Pappu only asked for 15. Where is she? Ranjana. Look. There she is. "He'll be happy?" "And listen, we'll sell these at the flea market." He's really shameless. Let him come. - But don't tell Pappu. - I won't. Rascal, where are the three guns? What three guns? What is this brother? What? See. - Yes.. - Shut up. "Baby. II" I'll give you any price you want. But who did you sell the gun to? Bhai, you made a mistake.. And made us pay the price. Mistake me? Bhai, she was not a school kid that you kissed her on the cheeks. You could've kissed her lips, but you kissed her cheek instead. This happened in the 70's. Shame on you. Bhai... you should've done as she did. Lip-to-lip, bhai. But you kissed her cheeks instead. - Is that why she slapped me? - Yes. Sister-in-law thought you're Emraan Hashmi.. But you turned out to be Amol Palekar. What the... I made a big mistake. Why didn't you tell me earlier that he isn't the boy, It was such a big misunderstanding. I even slapped the poor guy. I wonder what he must be thinking about me. - Then say sorry. - But where will I find him? No need to go anywhere, there he is. Say sorry. Liping bro, liping. That... I don't understand anything you're saying. You can talk? Of course I can. But... you can talk too? Yes. But why were you talking in gestures? Because my boys said that you're deaf and dumb. I am glad that you can talk and listen. Even I'm glad that you're not deaf or dumb. Now I can apologies. It was my mistake, why will you apologies? Your mistake? I had no idea I was supposed to kiss you on your lips. - What? - Yeah! - "Listen... - What?" "There's something in my heart, can I say it?" "Do you want me... to bring you the stars... like other crazy lovers?" "You can wear the bridal dress... and I'll wear a coat." "Don't delay any more." "Come be my wife." "We'll get married in Mumbai... and honeymoon in Dubai." "What's the hurry... to be your wife so soon?" "I still have to tell my brothers... about you?" "There's a feeling in my heart... and the ambiance is thrilling." "But you will have to wait... don't be a psycho." "Don't delay any more." "Come be my wife." "We'll get married in Mumbai... and honeymoon in Dubai." "What's the hurry... to be your wife so soon?" "I still have to tell my brothers... about you?" "We can be a couple..." "First you stop being a bully." "Button up your shirt completely..." "and change your style slightly." "You're my sweetheart." "I'll do what you say." "I kissed you once... and my life changed completely." "My heart's jumping... jumping.." "How about we do lipping... lipping." "But you will have to wait... don't be a psycho." "Don't delay any more." "Come be my wife." "We'll get married in Mumbai... and honeymoon in Dubai." "What's the hurry... to be your wife so soon?" "I still have to tell my brothers... about you?" Why are you walking like this? I shutdown all my bad business' for you. I have become descent. It'll take me some time to change my style. And it will take brother lesser time to recognize you. You've changed from Ajju to Ajay.. So learn to walk and speak like a descent man. Fine... don't worry. I'll try my best. - And stop using these slangs. - Okay. - Please don't give brother high BP. - Okay, fine. Sir... it's still increasing, sir. Boss, you get worried over trivial reasons. - It's a small thing.. - Small thing? Did your father get married three times.. And created such hassles? I've fixed Ranjana's marriage somewhere else. And now she's in love with someone else. And she's going to introduce us to him today. Is this a small thing? - Boss... - Ranjana's here. Brother. - What's all this? - Nothing. Just my routine checkup, everything's normal. Sit. Sit... Sit... - Sir, can I sit too? - Ajay. Brother asked us both to sit. Thank you, sir. What would you like to have? Cutting.. He means nothing... Nothing. I don't drink tea. Brother, I'm sure you chose a descent boy for me. But Ajay... is really nice. Brother, we really love each other. - And so Ajay and I... - Marriage... You two want to get married. - Are you angry? - No, no, I am not angry. It's a really small thing. If you're happy, I am happy. You're not just my responsibility, in fact you're my life. - Sir... mom and dad... - All my three mothers are dead. And father will be soon. No, he meant his mom and dad. He wants to know when he can introduce them to you. Yeah... we'll meet them. Once I cancel this wedding. They are really decent people. It's really tough to explain descent people. Let me know if it gets too tough for you. Huh? He means, if it's too awkward for you.. Then he'll go request them. No... it's alright. I'll handle it. Yes, sir. That's life. I'll handle it. - Sir, can I say something? - Of course. You see, matches are made in heaven. And people only create problems. Like... Romeo-Juliet. Devdas-Paro. Shirin-Farhad. What? - Shirin-Farhad. - Who? Shirin-Farhad? What about them? - You know their love... - Knot? No... Chewing gum? - Bond. - Bond. Bond! - Bond! - What about it? People break that bond. But we'll get married. You're with us. - Who's she in love with? - A boy... tall, handsome. Wears glasses. He seems from a descent family. Descent? We didn't exactly fix her marriage with some dacoit. How did she fall in love? Who will explain this to that old man? - What old man? - That Ghunghroo... He should've been begging at our feet.. But he made him our relative instead. And now he'll make us dance to his tunes. If he finds out we've chosen someone else.. He'll curse us over and over again. We're brothers after all. We'll share it together. I'll take some... and you can take some. What about the rest? - You.. - You all will take the rest. You rascals. You were all so eager in congratulating him. Now Pay! You all here... so suddenly. Is everything okay? - We.. - What's wrong? Come, sit. Sit. Greetings, sit. Rafiq. Get tea and snacks for the guests. Snacks? - You won't get it. - What? They will cancel it. So, Uday... what is it? Shirin-Farhad. Shirin-Farhad? - I mean... in love.. - I don't get it. Matches are made in heaven.. This marriage isn't possible. - What are you saying, Uday? - Let them say it. I was yearning to hear them say this. What are you saying? What do you mean by this marriage isn't possible? - I mean.. Have you all lost your mind? I've booked everything... right from the horse to the DJ. What's more... We've even decided who's going to do the serpent dance. So now who's going to sit on the horse? Who's going to do the serpent dance? Even we fixed everything.. From our sister's Mehendi to Daler Mahendi. - What? - Daler Mahendi. Daler Mahendi. But you see... she's in love with someone else. So what can I do? Please don't mind. No, no, of course not. Do you want me to distribute blankets to the poor? Why did he point towards us? He meant him. - Mr. Uday Shetty. - Yes. My son agreed to marry your daughter.. Without even taking a look. - Without a single look. - Yes. If that decent boy finds out.. That her future wife is cozying-up with someone else.. Won't that decent man be upset? It will, don't worry God's blessed me everything... Yeah right... Fame... Fortune...! - Respect. - Respect? You still have respect? Yes... l still do. We'll find a girl for your son. See that. These two can't find a girl for themselves. They are roaming around like raging bulls.. And they claim they'll find a girl for my son. Right. My son would rather stay bachelor.. Than marry someone from your family. And yes, if your father remarries for the fourth time.. And bring forth another sister. Then before fixing her marriage. Don't forget to ask her if she's having an affair too. Control! Control! What if she's in love? What are you saying? You shouldn't forget that they're our relatives. Relatives? They should be entombed. People swear on my decency... but after this will I be able to face anyone. Control, Uday! Control. - Boss... is your gun loaded? - Yes. - Then fire... - No! It's our fault. It's not such a big mistake, He's being too smart. I'll talk to him. You? - I know how to handle people like him. Ghungroo, I was saying... Shut up crooked shoulder. Bloody rascal, scoundrel, good-for-nothing, scum. But that doesn't rhyme. Stop thinking about the rhyme. Concentrate on the cusswords. And when the brother's Majnu(ROMEO).. Sister's bound to be someone's Laila(JULIET). She must be involved with someone. What are you looking at? You want to hit me? Hit me. Come on... hit me. Goons... bloody goons. You will never reform. You're only wearing this garb of decency. Ghunghroo... we're embarrassed too. I don't care. - Go and hide your shameless faces. - Please.. Why did you come here? I told you I'll deal with them. Sir... this is my home. So Ghunghroo's a paying-guest here? Sir, he's my father. My dad. Ghunghroo... This is amazing, Ghunghroo. All this was a little hard to understand. There was a strange confusion. Actually... the boy Ranjana loves is your son. Ajay. Oh... This is truly amazing. Like I said... your sister can never choose a wrong guy. Let me introduce you. This is Majnu. My friend, business partner, brother, companion... Everything! "Majnu bhai.." - Ghunghroo... - Yes. - You were talking too much today. - It was nothing. Nothing. You even involved my father. - I was tensed. - Tensed? Do you know what happens when the bull charges at you? This time... You can't even light a lighter. How will you fire a gun? Practice. College... knowledge. What? You don't get the boy? What are you saying? Ghunghroo's family is so decent. Even the flies in his house have hover decently. Ajay's over-smart gait. Raising his hand while meeting. Lighting a matchstick like this. Normally people from our profession do these things. Boss, these days college kids have become more stylish than us. - Right. - It's become a fashion. Yes, Majnu sir. You doubt him for no reason. Exactly. Ranjana's getting engaged. Let's go, we've much to do. Come on. Let's go. Smile... this is not a funeral. It's as good as a funeral for me. After Ranjana's engagement.. Both the brothers will trouble me again. - There he is. - All fine? How am I looking? Very nice. Come. Let me introduce me to Ranjana's fianc. You better explain that rascal Majnu. - I am explaining him. - Good. Ajay! - What happened? - Nothing. Ajay... Queen Padmavati. Princess of Nazabgarh... Chandni. - Boss... - Huh! - Sheikh sir's here. - Okay. Okay- Come on. "Hey Sheila-Munni." "Does he look like bread to you?" "Then why were you buttering him?" - Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna.. - Quiet. "Quietly shell out all the money you looted.." "under the pretext of marrying him." "When Ajju resorts to violence, he doesn't care about gender." "Right?" "Son... give us one day's time." We meet after a long time. We wouldn't have met today either, Ajju bhai. Ajay! - If you tell anyone about me.. - Why would we? We don't want our secrets revealed either. - Yes... - We don't. Uday sir... - Shall we start with the rituals? Of course. - Come on. - Ajay, come on. - Wait a minute. Majnu, where were you? Preparing for the groom's send-off. But that only happens at the wedding. This is just the engagement. Didn't anyone tell you? We weren't told a number of things... Samadhi ji. No... it's Samdhi. Slip of tongue. Because that's going to be your future. Uday... you're mistaking him for a decent boy.. But in reality he's Mumbai's biggest goon. Bhai! "Majnu bhai." Kapoor! Tell us this decent rascal's history. Don't be scared, you're with Majnu now. This is Ajju bhai. Mumbai Police's biggest headache. Riots... vandalism... Ransom, Extortion, money-laundering, Illegal-possession. Did you hear? And most importantly... he isn't even his son. You said even the flies at Ghunghroo's home are decent. Now do you see what kind of family... and insects they really are? Majnu, please listen to me.. The Lord's blessed us with two ears and one mouth. So talk less and hear more. - Majnu... please talk to me. - Shut up. Not a word more, or I will kill you. What did you say? What? Forget the rhyme, concentrate on the cusswords. You made me concentrate on the cusswords.. And failed to concentrate on your son. You want to let our innocent sister many this goon. You want to ruin her life and our respect. Boss, is your gun loaded. There's a huge crowd gathered here, what can I do? Don't do anything. Control. He's completely changed now, he's become descent. We couldn't reform yet, you think he can. Control. Majnu... control. We're Uday-Majnu. Uday-Majnu. We've done everything that's evil. And you want to outsmart us. He's humiliating them, that's okay.. But why is he humiliating us as well? - Listen to.. - Get lost. - Listen to me... - Get out. - Listen to me.. - Get lost... Listen to... Hey! He's my father! And I am yours. If you touch him again, I'll break your arm later.. And rip it off first. Bloody... street thug, don't forget.. We just recently turned decent. - But before this I was a goon too. - You were... But I still am one. And this bloody fool... couldn't describe what a big goon I really am. Go to Mumbai and ask anyone. I've more cases than the number of local trains. And tell me one thing.. His mobile... my sim. Who are you to give a miss call? His sister... my love... who are you to interfere? I am her brother as well. Majnu. All these bloody Majnu's get stoned in the end. You can't find a Juliet for yourself.. And now you want to interfere with the one I am getting. Till today... I got everything I wanted. And now your sister dwells in my heart. Whether we get engaged or not.. But she will get married, with only me. End of story! What are you all waiting for? Throw this rascal out. I told you not to turn decent. Now you'll have to pay. I know 2006 ways to break 206 bones. Whether you're a blood-brother or distant. I'll rip anyone apart that tries to interfere with my love. You made pigeons sit on decent people, didn't you? But I am not that decent. 'H. Those who mess with me... I rip him apart. 'H. You can't imagine what will be sitting on your heads? What? What? Look, crow. Crow... Crow... Control. Control Uday. Control. Control. Majnu... now Uday isn't confused anymore. You were absolutely right. Decency is like a bubble. It has no value. It's worth nothing. What's wrong, boss? I got excited after a long time.. So I got a catch in my body. There are only two things this world values. Property... and rascals! I thought I'll make do with words, not bullets.. And buried my guns, but it's time to get them out now. I knew we'll need them. Hey... did you get the weapons? I found the bullets, but still looking for the guns. Hurry up... hurry up. That bloody novice made crows sit on us. Now we'll make those crows sit at his oblation. We'll give him salvation. That's more like it. - Hey... did you find the guns? - Yes, I did. I even found some missiles, should I take them along too. Why don't you take the tank along too? We're going to kill Ajju, not attack Israel. He even took my favorite goggle. Uday... Majnu. You two didn't tell me.. That you're related to Ajju bhai. How can Badshah Khan take money from Ajju's brothers-in-law. Hey fatso... We've no relation with Ajju anymore. We've broken all ties. What? You broke it off, not him. This is all good if he breaks it. And he only breaks bones. Whether it's the Ace of spades... and Ajju's punch.. Both mean game over. Don't lock horns with him. Go fall at his feet and apologies. And you do remember where the feet are, don't you? It's this. And don't let go until he doesn't forgive you. Uday... Uday... Uday... you're the sensible one. You've got brains. You know, if he doesn't forgive you.. He'll rip Uday and Shetty apart. Where's everyone? Right behind you! Stop these fools. If they die, we won't get any more credit. Stupid fools want to wage a war at the age of dying their hair. Rascals... Come, dear. You called them, didn't you? Where are you two going to die? See... they've already made up their mind.. - That we'll die. Yes. If Ajju hits you, you two will be dead. And if you two kill Ajju.. You'll either be sentenced to death or imprisoned for life. At this age, life imprisonment is as good as death sentence. Did you two ever think.. What will happen to me after you're dead? What's wrong with you two? "You're so decent and sensible" and want to fight that petty goon Ajju. When a decent man's honor is at stake.. Then he's the biggest goon of all. I told you to get the car. - I will slap you.. - Go get it. Stop these fools, mom. Fine, go on. My daughter will face her fate. But did you ever think.. What will happen to your sister after you two? Uday, God has blessed you with everything. But what does your sister have... except for you? Use your brains instead of using your hands and legs. And strike at Ajju's heart. When you can kill him with sugar, why give him poison? They fixed your marriage with someone else! I will kill those two. - End of problems. - Ajju.. Fine. Kill them. So that there's no difference between you and them. So will you marry the guy they chose for you? - I would prefer to die first. - Dear! I think there's only one option left. You two should elope and get married. No, uncle. I cannot humiliate my brothers. I will get married only with their consent. Look, dean They would prefer to die.. Rather than giving their consent willingly. Don't worry. You will either marry me or no one. HOW? To prevent any complications in the marriage from your side.. Uday and Majnu have gone to invite some Wanted bhai. What? Wanted bhai. Pa... why are you shocked to hear about Wanted bhai. I was shocked when I first heard the name of RDX. But after hearing about Wanted.. I feel like someone shoved an electric pole down my... You don't know Wanted bhai! Wanted bhai! "Wanted bhai!" "Wanted bhai!" - "Welcome... - Wanted bhai!" "Wanted bhai!" Welcome... Welcome... Uday-Majnu. How did you know it's us? This is my island, not America.. Where anyone can come in without permission. And secondly.. You two still use that cheap perfume that's available at the flea market. Yes... Bhai... people like us hardly hit the target. But he never misses. I hate to lose. So... what brings you two here? We came here to give you the wedding card. - Wedding? - Not us. I was wondering... who decided to buy these two old ruins? That was a joke. Joke. Majnu sir... ask him about this hole. Common sense, Majnu... common sense.. Which is not so common. Did you hear? Get lost. Oh no... Honey! Leave me. - What did this boy do now? - Let go. Honey. No... no... Honey. Son... not again... Bloody fools... l told you to keep him away from drugs. You useless bloody.. Honey... son. What else can I do? You can't fulfill one single wish of your son. - L.. - I hate you! I hate you! - Honey.. - I hate you! Why is Honey so angry with you? What wish didn't you fulfill? I'm prepared to give my life for his every desire. But this time I looked everywhere to fulfill his wish.. But couldn't find her anywhere. - Is it... some new drug? - Not a drug. His love... his madness. Since he saw that girl.. He keeps painting his pictures like a madman. Honey is a painter? Yes. Why? Good. Good to know, I am a painter too. Sir... Honey sir cut his veins. Call the doctor! Call the doctor! Honey. Honey, my son. What have you done? You're my world, son, I won't let anything happen to you. She's my world, dad. She's my world. This girl that's in your paintings.. I will soon make her your reality, son. Not just her, I'll abduct her entire family, in fact the entire city. She will marry only you, son. Every drop of your blood will become the vermillion on her forehead. We came here to hit the final nail.. But the hammer fell on our head instead. On one side is that goon Ajju.. And on the other side is that Wanted's junkie son Honey. At any cost, we won't let Ranjana marry this junkie. All the problems are in your family's weddings. What's my fault? My father fulfilled the quota for marriages in our family. And I'm running around with his kids. And seems like my sister won't get married either. We'll get her married as soon as we land. And send her off. The rituals can be performed later. And listen up. No one should know about this. - We swear we won't tell anyone. - Let's go. Come on. "Welcome." "Welcome." "Welcome. Welcome. Welcome." Thank you... thank you. Majnu, God's blessed me with everything. Fame, fortune, honor... And the groom's decent too. Once my sister gets married without any problems.. I will take a skinny dip. You mean take a dip in Ganga. We both will take a dip and drown those two. Yes. - Who? - That bull and the blind. Wanted and Ajju. Don't mention those two rascals. Forget them. "Wanted bhai." "Wanted bhai." Wanted. - "Welcome.. - Wanted bhai." Wanted sir. - Welcome. - Welcome. Your sister's getting married.. And you forgot to invite the groom. It was a joke. Joke. Joke. But the truth is Honey will soon get married too. I see. We were informed that.. He's going to find the love of his life in this wedding. Find the girl? - Who told you? - My new friend did. No, boss. Madam, I.. - You told Ajju that Wanted's son loves Ranjana as well. - No. - Shut up. What a way to stop the marriage. Your moves are better than those on the chessboard. Why did you decorate the place? Is someone getting married? We didn't decorate this place for dancing. I asked because I don't see the bride and groom anywhere. You will... you will. The wedding procession will arrive soon. Will the bride arrive with the guests? She must be right here, isn't it? So not get her blessed by this fuse bulb.. I mean Wanted Bhai. - Where is the girl? - There she is. Majnu. Come. Let me introduce you to the guests. Come. - Ranjana, that Ajju. - I know.. Ajju is such a rascal. He brought Wanted and Honey here to spoil the wedding. - I should cover my face, right? - Yes. You do that. Now watch the fun. What's wrong, sir? We're heading in the wrong direction. The fragrance is coming from this side. - Come. - The blind guy's coming here. This is the queen of... Nazabgarh. How do you do? - And he is.. - Everyone knows him. - Wanted sir, this is Chandni. - Hello. My daughter. - My... - I mean mine. I was wondering, I haven't gone hunting for a long time.. So who fired the gun. It was a joke. Joke. There's still time. The decoration's the same, so are the guests. Just change the groom, what say? B Here comes Ranjana. Judging by her long veil.. It's even longer than the curtains on our windows. No, it's our tradition. And we've another tradition. Only the groom gets to take the veil of after the wedding. Ohh... Then I'll have to do something about this tradition. "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The damsel's hiding behind the veil." "And she's stolen my heart." "The sweet sound of your bracelets." "The sweet sound of your bracelets." "Makes me hover around you, sweetheart." "The wedding drums are resonating.." "all around, sweetheart." "My eyes have locked with yours." "Everyone says this couple's perfect." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "My earrings... tinkle only for you." "My heart's grown sentimental... only for you." "Since we met... everyone else was jealous." "Since we got together... everyone was against me." "Stop flirting with the girl." "Put a full stop on your love." "Romance has ruined many lives." "We're drunk to the core." "if you take this any further." "We'll teach you a lesson." "And you'll enjoy it." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." It was a joke. Just a joke. "There's a uproar all around." "You make me complete." "You're the one for me." "You announced to the world." "My first romantic flick... is a hit." "Your love is filmy." "Don't take such risks." "You don't know what your climax is." "Stop blowing the trumpet." "We will never give you green signal." "Park your car on the side." "Move aside." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." "The wedding trumpets are blaring." Take everyone to our island. Honey, my son. Your birthday's on the 13th. And I've decided that.. You and Ranjana will get engaged on the same day. Dad. You are the greatest dad. Thank you so much, dad. I love you. This engagement isn't possible! What did you say? I didn't hear you clearly. Brother said this engagement isn't possible. Majnu... Uday, this isn't your engagement. This is my son's engagement. This engagement isn't possible because he's your son. Uday! They'll directly get married. Your son loves our sister. It's not right to make lovers suffer for so long. You made me really happy, Uday. For a second I thought you're against dad's decision. Yes... l was already seeing a lot of dead bodies before the engagement. Joke... it was a joke. Uday. Congratulation Uday. What did you do, Uday? You've lost your mind. Yes, I wanted to teach that Ajju a lesson. It's your ego... your obstinacy. - You're ruining Ranjana's life. - Yes, it is my obstinacy. He'll be ruined along with Ranjana. You've gone crazy, have you lost your mind. Shut up! Ranjana is my sister. I can take any decision I want. Who are you to interfere? Who am I? Ranjana's my sister too. Don't forget, Majnu can give up his life for the right cause.. And even take someone's life. You will kill me. Me? Kill me! Kill me! Everything is fair in love and war. It's his love... and I'm going to wage a war. Even if I've to squander everything I have.. I won't lose to that Ajju. I would rather break, but not bow.. Where's my phone? - My phone. - Here.. Sir. What happened? Why are you crying? Get the car! Get the car! No point, boss... Uday sir.. What did you say? I'll rip you apart and bury you alive. Uday is going to be fine. "Uday." Talk to me. I raised my voice... hit me. Rip me apart. But please get up. Get up, Uday. Get up. - Boss, God's will.. - What God? Just because You're God doesn't mean You can do anything.. And I'll do nothing. I will set the world on fire. Burn it down to ashes! Uday... get up. I've no one in this world except for you. Don't leave your Majnu alone. We always did everything together. And when it was time to go, you left without me. This is wrong. Absolutely wrong, Uday. Absolutely wrong. Control, Majnu. Control. Uday's voice is still echoing in my ears. That's because lam still speaking. What joke is this? No joke... I'll get a similar attack on the wedding. What? - I mean... if the brother dies, the sister can't get married. Yes... The wedding will be postponed for 40 days. We're Shettys. We mourn for 1.25 years. And during this time, we can take care of many such Wanted bhais. Right, Majnu. To hell with Wanted bhai. You gave me a big shock today. If you ever play such a dirty trick on me again.. I will really kill you. He's a rascal, but loves me a lot. Right? At least now I know.. There are few people who'll mourn my death. Five... I cried the most. He's lying. I cried the most. Why? Do you have three eyes. Boss, I cried the most. Boss, why don't you die for real. Then you'll know who cries the most. Scoundrels, shut up. Be quiet, Uday bhai is alive. - Now... who's going to die for real? - Ajju. You really taught him a good lesson by fixing this marriage. Now let's see how he gets married. Pretend to love Honey. I can't do that. And anyway, I love Uday and Majnu. Both of them. Why not one more? Loving anyone else is a sin. Hey... stop this pious act, it's so not you. If the police find out that Nazabgarh's princess and queen.. Are hiding here, do you know what will happen Babita? Babita? Right, Poonam. Poonam? Rascal knows our real names. Is that your real name? Hey... you think your threats can scare us. And if you think that, then... you're right. - We'll do as you say. - You have to. And yes... there's not much time. Get it done in 24 hours. Mom... I can't pretend to love Honey. Not at all, we don't have to pretend at all. - Yes. We've to really love him. The Don's a bigger game. He can build another Taj Mahal for you. And forget about those Uday and Majnu... - They've crossed their expiry date. - That they have. - But mom, you and that Wanted.. - Oh baby, come on. Whether Wanted's your father-in-law or father.. And Honey becomes your husband or brother.. It doesn't make a difference. The most important thing is... we should get our hands on the property. And remember, if you get Honey, you get Money. And when you get the Money... - Honey's out! - That's my girl. Control, Uday... Control! - What's going on, Uday? - I don't get it either. They're kissing, what else. - That Honey's too much. - No, Honey can't do such a thing. Nowadays they are all the same. Maybe the Princess is clearing the dirt from Honey's eyes. That's possible. If you ask the princess, that's what she will say. She's taking the dirt out. No, no... I don't believe it. No. - Want to bet. - Okay. If it's heads, they're kissing. If its tails, it's dirt. Tails... equals to dirt. Okay- Where's the coin? Coin.. Uday... do you have a coin? We want to toss. - I have one. - Great. - Give me. - I don't have it. Forget it, I have one. - What is it? - Tails. See... Tails. It's Heads, Uday. Heads. Did you have to tell them? What? They must be kissing. Honey can do anything, but the Princess will never do such a thing. Daddy, no matter how hard the fruit it.. But a knife can cut it right through. What do we care. This is between the knife and the watermelon. And the ones who own the watermelon. - Come. - Come on. Now kisses and then Mrs. Thank god, it cleared. I'll just be back in 2 minutes. What's going on? What were you doing with Honey? I see... l was just clearing the dirt in his eyes. Were you clearing the dirt in his eyes, or throwing some in ours? - You're doubting me? - I... - You're doubting me? - Chandni. Sorry... l forgot to say thank you. Thank you? For what? Thank you for what? Thank you for clearing the dirt in my eye. And... Hello? Yes, dad. Yeah, I am coming dad. Heated'? Now do you see? Are you satisfied now? Its too much. Idiots. How dare you doubt me? I make her understand. Listen... Chandni. Listen to me... I am Uday. Listen... your anger is justified. He's such a cheapster. Bloody ignorant. I'm ashamed to say he's my friend. Rascal... What happened? He isn't fit to talk to. No need to keep any relation with him. Should I come? The time has come tell him. This is the right moment, go tell him. What are you ranting? Tell him what? Don't you get it? Are you small kids? Tell him... Get lost. What's wrong? Did.. - Kids. - Kids? - Marbles? - Marbles? - I don't get it. - I didn't either. Ranjana, now you'll believe me.. That I can paint your picture with my eyes closed. What is it? Give me a kiss. - Someone will see us. - Who? Father's blind... and I've blinded the son. Come on. Wow... what a picture. Thank you, uncle. Come my love, I've finished painting your picture. Thank God I found out before our wedding.. Otherwise my life would've been ruined. Why? What happened? I am your life? Your passion? And you painted Chandni! Who... who... made this? - Hussain sir just made this. - When did he come here? It's a joke.. He doesn't even understand a joke. Bro... you're too high.. you made this. I hate you, Honey! I hate you. Ranjana! Ranjana! Thank you. I am leaving. Ranjana! Ranjana! Listen to me. Ranjana! Honey, forget her. What's this all about? - Do you love the princess? - What are you saying, bro. I love Ranjana madly. I am crazy for her. Then how did you make the Princess' picture? Huh! Do you love the princess and want to marry Ranjana? The princess? But I met her only once. But you never met Ranjana. Are you confused? Hey... senior citizen. Honey. Hey... Mr. Painter, if you close your eyes and make a painting.. Then who will it be? I will make the painting of the one I love. And you? Same as Majnu said. - His love.. - No, no, I meant my girlfriend. Get it? So you don't love Ranjana. You love the one you painted today. Come, let me explain you few more things. And yes... he's made a wonderful painting. Truly amazing. You'll be amazed too. - Majnu.. - Yeah.. God's blessed me with everything.. Stop ranting your dialogue from circa 1939... Listen to me.. - Same thing about your fame, fortune, respect. Say something else. Fine. Look... the painting is Chandni's, Honey's hands.. - Yeah. But the brain behind it is Ajju's. He wants to find a love for our bud. Tomorrow Wanted is throwing a party. And he will definitely do something in the party. So... what say? - What's to say? - Meaning.. It's clear. - Sure? - Completely. - How? - Same old way. You mean like Michael.. No, no.. Like we did Teja. - Fine. - Fine? Yes, fine. - Yes, fine. - Yeah. "Welcome." Strangle him so hard... Quite. Not me, him. - Is he dead? - The rascal's dead. - What? - He's dead. - Why are you whispering now? - Yeah, he's dead. - Give me the gunny bag. - Here. Have you seen his body? Feels like he's born in a gym. - Bro... - It's the breeze. How's my can? Go on. Go! Thank you, bro. You take care of the body... and I'll go eat my dinner. The cap's really nice. Where are you going? Go inside. Alone. - You know... l never interfere in your work. I want you to do it today. - Do it. - Why? You know... l am scared of ghosts. Ghosts are just an illusion, a sound... A delusion. Who is it? Bro... Breeze... it's just the breeze. It feels nice.. Cool breeze in night. What happened? - How did the body get her? - We brought it here. But how did it get here? Breeze? Fear. The fear inside you. Don't be scared. I am right here. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Don't be scared. Uday Shetty's right behind you. Don't be scared. Ghosts don't care whether you're Shetty or Srivastav. They just kill whoever they want. Majnu... He's gone. I have to dig a hole here because it's Dubai. Back in India there are holes everywhere. I could've buried him in one of the road. L didn't kill Ajju. I'm completely reformed. That scoundrel Majnu murdered Ajju. He hasn't reformed yet. God's blessed me with everyone. Fame, Fortune, Respect... and I am still a bachelor. Uday! He knows my name. Uday! Do you have a matchstick? Matchstick? You fool... I could've died for your cheap matchstick. Can't you buy a matchstick from the same place you bought cigarettes? - You're alive. - You call this life? Wandering around at untimely hours. Consider me dead. Philosophy... Philosophy... I'll put a bullet in your head. You can't kill the dead, Uday sir. I am going. No! Don't go. Stand here. This is just a lighter. Lighter. You don't normally see the dead. Light your cigarettes. I can't see anyone here. You don't normally see the dead. Who are you looking for? - Majnu. - When did he die? He isn't dead yet. He just went inside a while ago, like you. Why do they build walls at a place like this? No one in his right mind wants to go in.. And all those in there don't want to come out. Waste of money. Nonsense. Stand still. Who is this? - Bro.. - Did you bury him? - I couldn't. - Why? The body keeps changing into the father or the son. - What nonsense. - Yes. Come on, I am here now. Don't worry, Come on. So many mosquitoes here. Dig... quickly. What will they find here, Bloody mosquitoes. I guess some eunuch's been buried here. Okay- Uday... run! Let's first bury him, or we'll be in trouble. Aren't we already in enough trouble? - Sing. - Sing? My mother used to say, whenever you're scared sing a song. Did your mother ever try burying a body? Yes, my fathers. Now sing, come on. "Why this Kolavari-Kolavari Di." "Why this Kolavari-Kolavari Di." "Dhinka Chika-Dhinka Chika-Dhinka Chika ae-ae-ae-ae.." "Dhinka Chika-Dhinka Chika-Dhinka Chika ae-ae-ae-ae.." Why are you so happy? I know a song that starts with 'A'. Are you here to play games with the ghosts? Dig. Hey... Sing from A. Sing from A. Sing, Sing. Listen.. "I do what I please." "You should do what I do." "One two Ka Four." "Four two ka One." "My name is Lakhan." "You're no hero, you're a villain." "You're a bloody dictator." "You..." Do I have to sing all the songs? Why don't you sing something? "You and me... Me and you... our love story is difficult." "Cannot be expressed in words." Come on sing. Hey... Hey... "Hey. I." - "What do you say? - What do we say?" - "Listen. - Yes." "Let's go to Khandala." "What will we do... in Khandala." "We'll sing, we'll dance and will have your blood, what else." Run... carefully... hey... Let's close the gate. She won't come out. "Baby I am thirsty... I want to run through your veins." "Don't keep me waiting... or I'll make you suffer." "You got to grab me or I'll grab you straight." "Quench my thirst, 'cause I can no longer wait." "LEW party, party, party... party's on." "Party, party, party... let's party come on." "LEW party, party, party... party's on." "Party, party, party... let's party come on." "You're the serpent I'm the snake-charmer." "Let's party, party, party..." "When the night falls." "You're the serpent I'm the snake-charmer." "When the night falls." "You will wield your hood around." "The poison that's in you.." "is my love." "The poison that's in you.." "is my love." "it's going to rein terror on me." "Things are out of control." "through my veins." "You course through my veins." "through my veins." "through my veins." "You course through my veins." "through my veins." "I've yearned... for your love." "I found you... after a long wait." "You dwell in me like... arrows in a quiver." "through my veins." "through my veins." "You course through my veins." "through my veins." "through my veins." "You course through my veins." "Hey listen sweety you are closest to me." "Sink in to my eyes come close to me." "Let's do this creepy huh." "You better get your head up high." "I'm here, I'm here you can try." "Now let me get you in the dark." "We met its coincidence." "through my veins." "through my veins." "You course through my veins." "pet's party, party, party... Party's on." "Party, party, party... let's party come on." "pet's party, party, party... Party's on." "Party, party, party... let's party come on." "pet's party, party, party... Party's on." "Party, party, party... let's party come on." - Isn't there another way? - This is the only way. But suicide is for cowards. - Suicide? Who's committing suicide? - You. And taking me along. Look forward. We haven't lived completely, you're talking about dying. We haven't even found a wife yet. Then why are you driving so fast? Tension! Tension! Tension! How does one stop this thing? - Doesn't this car have brakes? - Not the car. Tension. My tension! What madness is this? Trying to commit suicide? I don't want him at the cost of your life. I am prepared to marry anyone you want. I lost. I lost even though I won. If anything had happened to you two.. She couldn't have lived without you two. And I can't see her die. I admit I am not worthy of her. You can find some decent boy for her. Someone who can keep her happy. Ranjana... see you! Don't forget to invite me on your wedding. Hey. We can find a decent boy for her... but where will we find a goon like you.. That can keep our sister happy. Even after 7 years we couldn't reform completely. - Right? - Yes. He still loads his gun.. And I still regret that I couldn't make my own Al-Qeada. And you... turned completely decent in 7 weeks. Because only Ajay can accept defeat. Not Ajju. This little girl... can sacrifice her love for us. You can sacrifice your love for her. So can't we forsake our obstinacy for your happiness. Stop staring and run along. Come on. Uday... why do we always take a right decision at the wrong time? Yeah... if we could take the right decision at the right time.. Then Chandni wouldn't have left us and basking in the arms of Honey. This is exactly why I put you two in the dark. But finally you two have seen the light. Now there will be darkness in Honey's life. What do you mean? Chandni played this charade of love on my request. What a rascal. I had planned an attack to stop my sister's wedding. But how will we stop Chandni's wedding? Worry not. I have an idea. Wanted's with the queen. Honey's with the princess. Father-son... mother-daughter. There should only be love between them, not love. What a rascal. What nonsense! It's not nonsense. Honey wants to marry Chandni instead of Ranjana. And you want to marry the Queen. This will make them brother-sister. It's a cocktail. Sorry uncle. At this age you should be surrounded by doctors, not damsels.. Not good. Hey man... regardless of how old Wanted sir is.. Even I can only last a week or two. There's no trusting this pervert, he can die any minute. Week or two... that's too much. Look at this condition. Would it look nice if the papers next day say... "Don dies of exertion in the middle of his nuptial Night." Does it look nice? The world knows.. Fathers have always given sacrifices for their kids. Who would sacrifice anything for this junkie. - He loves his pills more than his father. - Shut up! Dad, you're ruining your son's happiness.. For a cheap woman. How does he know? Honey! Don't forget that she's your future mother. Mother... I don't need a mother. Honey, even I never dared to go against my decision. And you... If only you weren't my son, I would've shot you. And I am shooting you because you're my father. Wanted sir. Wanted sir. What did you do? Years later his heart was blossoming with love.. But you crushed it. You opened fire on your blind father. Dad! Dad! Please wake up, dad please forgive me. What forgive me? First you shoot him and then beg for forgiveness. Your boss is dead you you're all quitting. It's a tradition to keep the guns at the boss' feet. Stop staring, pick up the guns. I'll take that one. What are you doing? Our tradition is to pickup the guns. Get up. Ajay. - Stop screaming... or I'll blow your brains out. Take positions. Don't move... you've a new boss now. But you will still get paid. His father troubled us more than Laden troubled America. "It's a Joke... Joke." He said it like we never heard a joke before. Swirled his head around like a spinning top. But Wanted sir... was a great man. And you've troubled that innocent man a lot... careful. What innocent. I am sure he wasn't innocent even when he was a kid. And what's all this... innocent, great... When you talk about someone even after he's dead... is a great man! Joke... it was a joke. Shoot! What's wrong? It's a fake. Made in china. Mine's a fake too. Mine too. Okay- Okay- Forget the rest, how was my acting? Nice... and what about me? - Great. How about we make a film? - I already made one. You already made it? Since you all arrived on this island.. Me and my cameras have been keeping an eye on you constantly. Son. Start the show. Hey.. If the brother dies, how will the sister get married? The wedding will get postponed for 40 days. We're Shetty's. We don't celebrate for 1.25 years. And we can kill numerous Wanted bhai's in this time. To hell with that Wanted bhai. Your shoes are really nice, Wanted sir. You'll taste them soon. Son... What is this? Come on, kiss me. - Someone will see us. - Who? Father's blind... and I've blinded the son. And someone introduce me to that Dr. Ghunghroo. Visiting time is 11am to 3pm. No visits on Sundays. This isn't your clinic, it's my island. - What a painting. - Thank you, uncle. - Who made this? - Hussain sir made this. - When did he come? - Forgive me. It's a joke. Don't you get a joke. And... where's the queen of Wallabgarh. That's Nazafgarh. I want to bury you. Dear, he's a huge prey. He can even build a Taj Mahal for you. And forget about Uday and Majnu. They've crossed their expiry dates. When the police find out.. That Nazafgarh's queen and princess are hiding here.. What will happen then Babita? Poonam? - Poonam? - Babita? So... you cheap perfumes. Laurel and Hardy. In the light of all the evidence and witness.. How should I punish you two? Under section 302. I don't like those who interfere. So... no one utters a word when I'm speaking. I will decide everyone's punishment. Because... l am the law, and blind too. So... should I spare you or kill you? "Should I spare you or kill you?" "What should I do with you?" - "Should I spare you... - Welcome." "Should I spare you or kill you?" - "What should I do with you? - Welcome." - Honey. - Sir, they took Honey. Why didn't you tell me? - You would've shot us if we did. - I still will. But where can they go? On one side is me... and on the other is the sea. And the dessert on the third side. You knew the truth about the mother-daughter, yet you didn't tell us. I thought just like you reformed, I reformed.. Similarly they will reform too. Yes, we'll reform our ways. We'll reform our ways. Yes, we swear on you two. You already took everything we had. Now you want to swear on us too. Seems like Wanted has high connections. Ajju. Wanted! The first name of Death. People are scared to even befriend us. And you locked horns with me. I am with you. You brought my son here, in the desert. Now I will dig your graves right here. Kill them. Finish them all. But kill Uday and Majnu. Hey... They have ruined my life. - Life and death... - Don't interfere. Look, I am not a Don, but.. Even I don't like it when someone interferes. Honey, can I come there? These two are bad news. When they set foot in any neighborhood, no one gets married. No bands playing. No trumpets blaring. The sales of double-bed dips down. Your father was supposed to get married. Did it happen? No. - Did you get married? - No. - Did I? - No. No, I didn't. - We didn't get married either. - No. These two are bad luck. And Wanted sir, we became enemies because of them. I'll break this relation today. This will end the enmity between us, right? I feel so relieved. - See you. - Okay, uncle. Let's go. - Come, dad. - Come on, let's go. First you duped me when you got her. Now you're trying to dupe me before you die. What do you think I am? Now I'm going to play a game with you. Game? The game of death. Sir. Fantastic, dad, my favorite game. You like to run, don't you? Now run. Run! Run! What happened? - Why are the choppers after them now? - I don't know. Let's go. Let's go... let's go. Someone help me! Don't worry. Throw it. Let's go... let's go. - Where's the steering? - Left... on the left. I am under the car. Honey's down there. Start quickly. Crush him. Amazing toys. We'll buy these for our kids. - Let's get married first. - Come on, get down. Someone help me? Someone help this poor helpless blind man. Where's my chopper? Where did I drop my diamond ring? - Diamond ring? - Yeah. I'll look for it. If I could find then mine otherwise yours. What? Where's my chopper? - Chopper. - Where's my chopper? But you lost your diamond ring, didn't you? It was a joke... joke! - Joke? - Where's my chopper? - My right. - Come on. - Come on. - Together. Take me there. Dad! Dad, run! Camel. Faster! Faster! What faster? - I was telling the camels. - Yeah. Faster. Crush him. Mangle him. Spill his guts! Somebody help my dad! Help my dad! Help my dad! Ajju. Ajay. Ranjana might get widowed before she gets married. Don't say that. We'll have to look for another boy. Where did these cames come from? Ajay! Rascals... get my son out. Yes, boss. Honey.. His aim's absolutely perfect, exactly at the legs. His aim's getting better than us. Honey, my son. Are you okay? Dad... your eyes? "Nothing matters in this world... except for these eyes." Today I realized Ghungroo... that you're push is really lucky. But who switched on his lights. Yes... it's hard to find water in this desert.. And he got his eyes back. Goddess can work her miracles even in the desert. Right? Now, I can see women and wink at them. And shoot the men. Father returned my eye-sight.. And the son saved my life. You two can go. Ajju! Why did you save him? We were going to save him. Yeah, he got their first... but we were coming to save you. - We'll go with them. - Yes. - We'll go too. - Come on. Wanted, don't forget that.. - You can see again because of us. - Right. If we hadn't kidnapped your son, you wouldn't have come here. And if you hadn't come here, you wouldn't have regained your eyesight. - Right? Right? Uncle, I admit I played games with you. Cheated you. But I did it for my love. And these two did it for the love of their sister. You have all done what you had to. Now it's my turn. On the 13th Ranjana and my son will get married. Ranjana's done for. But dad, she loves Ajay. Yes... so... l was speaking about my other son Ajay. It was not a joke... not a Joke! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! All these camels running together, means there's a storm coming. He just got his eyesight 10 minutes ago.. And he's already seeing the storm. Are we waiting here to welcome the storm? Hold hands everyone. Run! God's blessed me with everything... Fame, fortune, respect.. Only thing missing was a storm. And the devil fulfilled that too. I think someone's cursed us with all the problems in the world. Run, Majnu. I've been running since I was a kid. First... l ran from school. Then I ran after stealing bread. After I became a gangster, I ran from the police. I ran when I had to sit. I ran when I had to walk. And when I had to run, lam running like a dog. I spent my entire life running. "Get over here tonight." "I'll call you what you like." "We'll make it such a night, to remember all our life." "You let me call you baby." "I'll really blow you mind." "O boy make your mind up.." "we're running out of time." "Welcome back." "Welcome.. Welcome.. Welcome.." "Welcome." "Welcome back." "Welcome." "Let me love you." "Love you all I can." "My heart's crazy about you." "I want to give you this heart." "Welcome." "Welcome Back." "Welcome." "Welcome Back." "O Girl... you're intoxicating... like a bottle of liquor." "And I feel intoxicated." "Crazy girl... she's so drunk.." "that she's holding me.." "instead of her friend." "She runs around the club, and trips on me." "Tell me why are you so drunk?" "Welcome." "Welcome Back." "Welcome." "Welcome." "Welcome Back." "Dance on the floor..." "and create an uproar." "Dance for me baby girl." "You sway... on the floor." "Like fire... reaching high." "Dance for me baby girl." "You look at me... like my body's on fire." "You look at me... makes all the girls jealous." "Honestly sweetheart... I can't get high without you." "When you look at me... I feel on top of the world." "Welcome." "Welcome Back." "Welcome." "Welcome Back." "Let me love you... day and night." "My heart's crazy for you... let me shower it on you." "Welcome Back." "Welcome Back."
