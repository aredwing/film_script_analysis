Once remote and little known, history is forcing them out of obscurity into the current of world events. Important among these islands is the British colony Trinidad. I'm looking for Inspector Smythe. - He's down there, sir. - Thank you. - Inspector Smythe? - Smythe here. Good evening, Inspector. I'm Anderson, from the American Consulate. Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson. You're a new arrival here. - Welcome to Trinidad. - Thank you. I've been meaning to call on you, - but I've been so busy getting settled. - Yes, of course. I thought your Consulate would want to be informed. The young man's an American. Neal Emery. Artist chap. Accident? - No. Suicide, apparently. Shot himself. - Good heavens. Now, let's have your light, will you? - When did it happen? - We're not sure yet. Those two fishermen found him adrift in his boat a few hours ago. All right, boys, you can go now. Thank you very much. Is there anything I can do? Well, we've got to break the news to his wife. - She's also an American. - Oh. You can carry on. I'll join you at headquarters. Get the medical report through as quickly as possible. - Yes, sir. - Well, shall we go now? Yes, of course. Poor girl. It seems awful to have to wake her up in the middle of the night to tell her this. Don't let it disturb you, Mr. Anderson. This hour of the night, the poor girl is usually wide awake. - To the Caribe. - The Caribe? - You mean she'd go to a place like that? - She works there. Inspector, once again you honor the Caribe with your presence. An unavoidable coincidence, I assure you. - We came to see Mrs. Emery. - Of course. Everybody does. You're just in time. I give you a good table. We're not here to be entertained. We want to talk to her. Alone.

Good evening. - I... - I know all about it. You're lonely, it's wonderful to meet an American girl, and couldn't I have a drink with you after the show? Well, the answer's no. If you're lonely, go home to your wife. This American girl has to make a change. - Oh, but you don't understand. I... - Oh, but I do. - Outside. - Hello. Mr. Anderson of the American Consulate. - Am I being deported or something? - No. We'd just like to have a chat with you. Well, I don't exactly have time for an international conference, - so make it brief. - When did you last see your husband? This morning at breakfast. Why? Did you talk to him? Sure. I asked him to pass me the salt. Did he tell you where he was going today? - I didn't know he was going anyplace. - Well, he did, and it's rather important that we know where. I'll think about it. Drop by tomorrow. I suggest you think about it now. - 'Cause if you're trying to protect him... - Protect him from what? Well, whatever it is, there's no longer any point. He's dead. How? Suicide. No. I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Emery. I'm afraid, if you don't mind, I... Did you hear everything quite clearly, Mr. Wittol? Believe me, Inspector, I was only trying to help. I said to myself, "Chris is in trouble. Maybe I can do something." Yes, we all know what a great heart you have. I'll have to ask you to come down to headquarters to answer a few questions and make identification. We'll wait outside. - Yes, sir? - Get me the medical examiner, please. Hello? - Hello, Doc? - Yes. - This is Smythe here. - Yes. Have you got anything for me on the Emery case? - I haven't had time yet. - Oh. Well, get to it as quickly as possible, please. - Has the identification been made? - Yes. His wife's in there now. As soon as she leaves... - Shall I wait? - I'll call you back. Yes. Thanks. Sit down, won't you? Cigarette? Thank you. That's not an easy ordeal for anyone. Funny, isn't it? When a person dies, you only remember the good things. Mrs. Emery, do you know of any reason why your husband should have killed himself? He'd been very unhappy for a long time. Was there any trouble between you? There was nothing between us. We lived in the same house for the past year, but that's all. - Did he have any particular setback lately? - No. No. Lately he acted as if things were going better for him. Oh? What things? He didn't tell me. There were lots of things he didn't tell me. Could they have been something to do with Mr. Fabian? - Max Fabian? - Yes. I believe he and your husband were closely associated. But Mr. Fabian's a wealthy man. What business could he have with Neal? He was a friend of his, that's all. Your husband bought you a rather expensive gift about a month ago. How could he afford it, doing sketches for $1 each at the Caribe? He couldn't. I made him take it back. Nevertheless, he had the money to pay for it. - Do you know where he got it? - He sold a painting. To Max Fabian, of course. - Is that illegal? - No, but it is illogical. I mean, Mr. Fabian paying your husband $1,000 for a painting. He happened to like his work. He's bought paintings from him before. Doesn't $1,000 seem rather high for the work of an unknown artist? All right. If the money was for something else, tell me. I'd like to know, too. I was hoping you'd tell me. After all, you and Mr. Fabian are very friendly. He comes to the caf frequently to see you. Lots of people come to see me. That's what I'm paid for. But you don't sit at the table with them, nor become quite so intimate. You are quite intimate with Mr. Fabian, aren't you? I think I've had enough of this. Mind if I go? - Inspector, I don't think... - Very well. There'll be an inquest in a couple of days. That'll be all for now. By the way, I wouldn't try to leave the island if I were you. The planes and the boats will be told to watch for you. Don't forget the sharks. I might try to swim. Mrs. Emery. I'll be right back. Mrs. Emery. Mrs. Emery, I'm sure the Inspector didn't mean to imply... Those were bricks falling, Mr. Anderson, not innuendoes. Well, if there's any way the Consulate can help... No, thank you. All I want to do is get out of here fast, catch the first boat back home. Are there any friends or relatives you'd like us to notify? Well, there's... No. I guess not. They tell me Trinidad makes the rest of the tropics look like Callahan's back yard. - Yes. It's very beautiful. - Must be. I have a kid brother who came down here five years ago to paint a tropical moon. He's still painting it. Say, maybe you know him. The name's Neal Emery. - Emery? - Yeah. He's about my size. He's a sort of a... No. I don't recognize the name. - You down here on business? - Yes, business. - Come down here often? - Yes. No. - Once in a great while. - Things must be picking up. I hadn't heard from him for months, and then all of a sudden I... - Excuse me. - Yeah. - Anything wrong? - I don't know. But I hope he makes it. I say, Jimmy, why waste your time with that? Here comes the real thing. May I have one more, Mrs. Emery? How about giving a fellow American a break, Mrs. Emery? My name's Peters. Freelance reporter. I'd like to get some details on this story. You know, American girl, ex-GI. - With pictures of me doing native dances? - Why not? - We could both pick up a few bucks. - Not interested. Listen, baby, you don't have to put on an act with me. I've been in that joint you work in. I'm an old friend of Mrs. Emery's. If she needs an arm to lean on, I think she'd prefer mine. Sure. Sure, whatever you say, Mr. Fabian. - There'll be no more of that. I'll see to it. - Thank you, Max. Why haven't you let me come to see you? Why should I bother you with my troubles? I was a friend of Neal's. I'm still a friend of yours. At least, I hope I am. Oh, Mrs. Emery? Inspector Smythe would like to see you, if you please. Of course. - Excuse me, will you, Max? - I'll wait for you. Oh, I'll be with you in a minute. Very well. Now, sign there, will you, please? Oh, Mrs. Emery, this is Jefreemy Bates, a fisherman from the island of Tobago. He has some information for us. Thank you. That'll be all for now. - We'll let you know if we want you to testify. - Yes, sir. Do you happen to have your passport with you? - Yes. - May I have it, please? Mr. Anderson tells me you're planning to return to the States. As soon as this is over. Well, I can't say I blame you. Your stay in Trinidad hasn't been a happy one. However, I'm afraid I can't let you go. Not just yet. Perhaps not for a very long time. Mr. Anderson, I... Mrs. Emery, your husband didn't commit suicide. - He was murdered. - Murdered? Yes. According to the medical examiner, there were signs of a struggle. He died of a fractured skull, not a bullet wound. The gun was fired after death. But who would want to kill Neal? I have here a statement made by the man who just left. I'd like you to hear it. "I, Jefreemy Bates, do declare that at 4:30 in the afternoon of Monday last, "I saw Neal Emery's boat docked at the landing "which adjoins the estate of Max Fabian. "There was no one on board. "I was in view of the landing for at least half an hour "and during that time saw no one approach or leave the boat." 4:30 in the afternoon, approximately the time at which your husband was murdered. You think Mr. Fabian... Or someone in his employ. But I can't believe it. He was a friend of Neal's. Mrs. Emery, if you knew Max Fabian's history, you'd have no trouble whatever in believing it. - But what reason could he have? - As for his precise reasons, I'm not sure, but we're certain your husband was involved with him, and murder is very much a part of Mr. Fabian's business. He's caused the death of many thousands. Oh, he's not a criminal in the ordinary sense. Far from it. He's a man who deals in political intrigue, secret information, treason. A man who has grown rich by exploiting trouble and unrest wherever they exist. During the last war, he recruited saboteurs for the enemy. He bought and sold vital military information for both sides. However, there's no need to go on. The important fact is that Max Fabian is now in the Caribbean and, frankly, we're disturbed. We have reason to believe that he's engaged in activities that threaten our security. Well, then, why don't you arrest him? Unfortunately, we have no proof. We can, however, arrest him for the murder of your husband and charge that you were the motive, that he killed Neal because he was in love with you and wanted to get rid of him. It would be difficult to convict him, but at least we can try. I realize it would be a very ugly business for you, and I regret to have to put you through it, however, I have no choice. I hate to think what tomorrow's paper will look like. By the time this is over, I won't be able to go back home. There is an alternative, Mrs. Emery. Yes, there is. And we'd much prefer it if you could help us find out exactly what Mr. Fabian is doing in Trinidad. Me? How could I... It's well known that he finds you most attractive. You could get us the proof we need. Is this where Neal Emery lives? Well, would you tell him that his brother's here? Come in. I Wittol, sir. - You are the owner of the Caribe? - Yes. Full owner. - You knew the deceased, Neal Emery? - Very well. An unhappy, tragic boy. - He was in your employ, was he not? - We had arrangement, that's all. I allowed him to use my premises for his sketching. - Purely out of friendship. - Inspector? You were good friends, then, eh? To give you an idea, I let him run up a bill at the bar, almost $100. Little secret from his wife. Can you give me any reason why Mr. Emery should have taken his life? When a man wants so much to be a great painter and has failed... You mean he was despondent about his work? Many things. To understand Mr. Emery, you must remember he was an American. It humiliated him to be supported by his wife. It's a ridiculous attitude, of course. Why should he object to such an arrangement? Myself, when I was young, I used to dream of such a thing. Now, of course, it's too late. That's all. Thank you, Mr. Wittol. You may step down. - Thank you. - Mrs. Emery, please? Mrs. Emery, we have no wish to add to your grief, and we shall try to conclude this hearing as rapidly as possible. You have heard Mr. Wittol and the others describe your husband's state of mind. Do you agree substantially with what has been said? - Yes. - Do you have anything to add? No. In your presence, did your husband ever speak of suicide? Yes, many times. - Inspector Smythe? - No questions, sir. That'll be all, Mrs. Emery. - We have no further evidence to present, sir. - Very well, then. Since there is nothing to conflict with the presumption of suicide, this inquest rules that the deceased died by his own hand. This hearing is adjourned. Look this way, Mr. Fabian. Flowers? - Thank you. - Buy some flowers. No. Chris, the worst tortures are those we invent for ourselves. You feel guilty about Neal? - Oh, I suppose so. - Don't. It was not your fault. You were very good to him. He said as much to me, many times. - Thank you, Max. - You must forget what's happened. Your life is ahead of you now. You deserve some happiness. I want you to make me a promise. I want you to promise that you'll let me help you. I will, Max, only... Well, right now, I don't know what I want to do, where I want to go. I... I just feel numb and tired. Would you like to come in? Everything thrives in the tropics, including gossip. It might be better if I didn't. You're a good friend, Max. But in a few days, perhaps you could come to the house for dinner. - I'd like to. - Shall we say Sunday? Sunday. Goodbye. And thank you. You're Steve. Dominique told me. And I know who you are. I read about you in the paper. What happened to him? Can't we talk about it later? We'll talk about it now. Well, there were so many things. - Not enough success... - I heard all that at the inquest. I wanna know what really happened. What's the matter, you think I'm down here by accident? Neal wrote and asked me to come down here. I got a letter in my pocket not five days old. - A letter? - Yeah. Why would he ask me to come down here and then kill himself? But I... Well, you remember what he was like. - Temperamental, moody... - He was moody for 30 years. Now, will you stop giving me a lot of double talk? I want some answers that make sense. - Look, I know you've had a shock... - Yeah, but not you. No, you walked out of that inquest like you were on your way to a cocktail party. Just a minute. What makes you think you can rush in here and talk to me like this? What do you know about me? I just have to look at you to know what happened. I can see how Neal fell for a dame like you, and I know the kind of time you gave him. It's too bad I got here a few days too late. A few days? You got here three years too late. If you loved your brother so much, why didn't you ever try to find out what was happening to him? No, you couldn't do that! But you walk in here and take your guilty conscience out on me. Well, I won't listen to it. I've had all I can stand of you and your brother and all of you! Since you have hurt her, you think you will feel better. You were distressed because you did not find her mourning in a black dress. - Widows have been known to wear them. - Not in the tropics, Mr. Emery. Only Spanish women wear the black mourning here. Well... It is not appropriate that you should leave now. You have said too many bad things. I think you will want to apologize later. Yeah, well, maybe you're right. Maybe I did talk out of turn. I don't know. There are many things you do not know. I will bring you a drink in the patio. It is cooler there. And you'll stay for dinner. Why have you not eaten? - We weren't hungry. - No one can live on grief. Yesterday is yesterday. Tomorrow is tomorrow. - You left out today. - Today is already yesterday. - Chris, I hate to keep apologizing, but... - It isn't necessary. It was the letter that threw me. I still don't understand it. He sounded so happy, so cheerful. When I walked into that inquest... I'll take it. - Yes? - Mrs. Emery, this is Inspector Smythe. I have here the arrival list from the customs office. There's a Steve Emery. Could that by chance be your husband's brother? Yes, it is. You haven't discussed anything with him concerning your husband's death? No, of course I haven't. Good. Is he with you now? - Yes. - Then I'll be brief. Tell him nothing. He must be kept out of this. Do you understand? Well, I'm not sure that I do. Well, we can't afford to take any chances. There's too much at stake. If you'll just do as I ask. And remember, we're counting on you. I understand. Goodbye. The club where I work. They want to know when I'm coming back. How long do you think you'll be here, Steve? Thanks. Well, Neal said something about a job down here, so I figured to stay for some time. - But now... - May I see that? Sure. Why would he ask me to come down here if he didn't want me to know what was going on? - What do you do, Steve? - I'm a flyer. I can't imagine what he had in mind. - He didn't say anything to you about it? - No, he didn't. Didn't even mention I was coming down here? Maybe he wanted to surprise me. He was like a little boy that way. Yeah. Poor guy. I did everything I could for him, Steve. - Sure. - I want you to believe that. Well, look, it's getting late. You've had a rough day. - Where are you going? - I don't know. To find myself a room somewhere. Oh. Well, I suppose you could stay here if you wanted to. No, thanks. I wouldn't want to put you to any trouble. It's no trouble. You could use Neal's room. Neal's room? Yes. It's right over here. I'm sure Dominique won't mind turning down another bed for a few days. Well, Dominique seems to have anticipated us. She's got some kind of mental radar. She knows what you're thinking before you do. Does it seem all right? Yes. This is fine. Thanks. - Chris? - Yes? - Good night. - Good night, Steve. - Say, Chris? - Yes? What about you? What are you gonna do now? - Go back to my job. - Why? Well, a girl has to live. Well, there's other jobs, other places. Is there anything else keeping you down here? Not especially. Who was the fellow that brought you home today? Just a friend of Neal's. Oh. You know, I was thinking, if there's nothing to keep you down here, maybe we can take the same boat home, huh? That would be nice, Steve, but I've sort of gotten used to the tropics. Don't you ever get homesick? I mean, three years is a long time. I know. I remember coming home after the war. I flew a bomber in from San Francisco. I remember when we passed over Chicago, my copilot had all he could do to keep me from setting that plane right down in the middle of Michigan Boulevard. Yeah, boy, I had it real bad. Hey, don't you ever get a yen for a place like that? Oh, say, an old theatre that you used to play in, maybe a park where you went ice skating? Think it over. The States might be just the thing for you. Anyhow, if you ever do decide to come back, look me up, huh? You know, you picked up a spare relative today. Thank you, Steve. I'll remember that. Say, Chris, when did it happen? - When did what happen? - Neal. What was the date? The 22nd. Why? Nothing, nothing. I... I was just wondering, that's all. - Is Mr. Wittol in? - Yeah. He's in the office. - You have an appointment? - In this joint? You kidding? What's your business? It's all right. Mr. Wittol has no secrets from me. He's been holding out on you. It's all right. Don't bother to get up. Yes? This ought to cover the bill. Don't make any more jokes. What jokes? What bill? Who are you? You remember a bill my brother ran up at your bar? Or wasn't there any bill? You? His brother? Of course, of course, of course. This is such a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Emery. Of course, under circumstances, an unhappy pleasure. Tell me, when did you arrive? What you doing in Trinidad? - You have business here? - I'll ask the questions. - What happened that day? - That day? Oh, oh. Nothing. Just a day like any other day. Why? You buried him too deep at that inquest. Look, Mr. Emery, with me there is no necessity to shoot in the dark. If I knew something, I'd tell you. What was the job he had for me down here? Job? What job? Your brother had a job for someone? He was trying to make an impression. Believe me. - You're lying. - Wait. - Where are you going? - To the police. No. Please, wait. Don't. All right. I see you are too intelligent to accept a half-truth. It's a matter of gallantry. Besides, for me she's a valuable investment. - You talking about his wife? - So you've met her? - That makes it difficult. - Makes what difficult? You have seen her quiet, dignified, soft and demure. But if you had seen her as I have, night after night, dancing, - stirring men's blood... - Look, will you cut out the poetry? Please, Mr. Emery, you must realize she is not just a woman, some woman, she's Woman with capital "W." How could any man feel that he possessed her completely? Is such a thing possible? You mean she was playing around? You see, you are already imagining and you are angry. American attitude. Never trust a beautiful woman. Typical. - Was she or wasn't she? - Oh, I... - Who was the guy? - Guy? What guy? There was no guy. This is what I'm trying to tell you. When a man is married to a goddess, he must expect other men to worship her. This killed him. This fact he couldn't accept. What I told you now is the truth. Believe me. Hello. May I speak to Mr. Fabian, please? - Where did he go? - Out. - Well, didn't he say where? - No, just out. Do you like him? - Well, he seems very nice. - Well, I like him. That's good. This one is a man. The other was a shadow of him. - Well, I hadn't thought much about it. - Maybe it is appropriate that you should. I shock you, perhaps? When one day is over, another day begins. - West Indian proverb? - West Indian household hint. - Good morning. - Morning. - Where've you been? - Oh, I was taking a walk. - How do you feel this morning? - Better, thanks. - Fine. Fine. - Where did you walk to? Oh, here and there. Well, it isn't a secret, is it? No, it's no secret at all. As a matter of fact, I hired a car for a few days. I thought I'd let you show me the island. I thought you were leaving right away. Well, I changed my mind. See, I figured if I stayed around for a while, it would give us a chance to get better acquainted. - You don't seem very pleased about it. - Well, of course I am. Well, fine. You wanna get started, make a day of it? Well, I'm not much in the mood for sightseeing, Steve. I... It will be good for you. And you'll need these. Do I take a liberty? It is the prerogative of a good and loyal servant to be impertinent. I wouldn't fight with her if I were you. She's got radar, remember? Hello! You having fun? - Thanks, Steve. - What for? For helping me to remember how. - What's that all about? - Oh, I was just thinking. I've had three wonderful days. I'm glad you decided to stay and get acquainted. So am I. Thanks. Dominique, you've got two starving people on your hands. - Have you anything to eat? - Hello, Chris. Max. I couldn't deny myself the pleasure of seeing you any longer. - Well, I... - I hope you don't mind my dropping in. Oh, no, of course not. I'm just surprised to see you, that's all. Well, good. For a moment I thought it was dismay. You're Neal's brother. - Yeah, that's right. - I'd heard you were in Trinidad. Well. - Chris, aren't you going to introduce us? - Oh, I'm sorry. - This is Mr. Fabian, Steve, a friend of Neal's. - How do you do, Mr. Emery? - Hi. - I'm very glad you're here. You know, the last time I saw Chris, I was quite worried about her. She seemed so terribly shaken up. But now, I don't think I've ever seen her looking more radiant. You're to be complimented. Oh, Chris, perhaps Mr. Emery could join us for dinner tonight. Oh, but didn't you get my message, Max? Message? No. Yes. I left word I couldn't make it. - Well, you see, with Steve here, I thought... - Well, bring him along by all means. I'd like him to see my house. Oh, did Chris tell you that I own several of Neal's paintings? No. She hasn't said much about you. Well, I don't know whether to feel hurt or flattered. But you will come, won't you? Yeah. - Yeah, I'd like to. - Good. It's settled, then. My car will pick you up at 6:00. I'll let myself out. Looks like he wants somebody to eat. Oh, good evening. Good evening. Won't you go into the living room? Mr. Fabian will be down in a moment. Thank you. Well, I didn't know you and Neal had such rich friends. You're quite right, Mr. Emery. I do have a lot of money. But I... Well, I hope it won't be a barrier between us. Why should it be? I have no objection to money. - Chris, my dear. - Hello, Max. - How beautiful you are tonight. - Thank you. I think you look lovelier in this color than any other. Don't you agree, Mr. Emery? Well, there are a few shades that I haven't seen her in yet. You have a treat in store. I mixed the cocktails myself this evening. - You'll have the usual, won't you, Chris? - Yes, I will. - And you, Mr. Emery, what would you like? - Oh, I'll have some of the usual, too. Hans. How are you finding Trinidad? Very nice place to relax, except that I came down here to work. Hey, maybe you can help me. You know, my brother wrote about a job, but nobody around here seems to know anything about it. Didn't he mention it to you? No, I don't believe he ever did, but then, I hadn't seen Neal for quite a few weeks before... Chris? Thank you. You going to be with us much longer, Mr. Emery? Oh, I haven't quite made up my mind. To your stay, then, however long. May it be a pleasant one. Gets more fascinating every minute. Chris, I brought my chef across half a dozen borders. If that dessert goes back untouched, he may start re-crossing them. Why, it's delicious, Max, but I've eaten so much tonight. It seems to me you've eaten very little. And you, Mr. Emery, I'm afraid my chef hasn't made much of an impression on you, either. Oh, I'm impressed, all right. With everything. Especially with this coat of arms. Has that been in your family a long time? I have no family. But all my friends said I deserved one, so I invented that crest. Why? Nothing. I just have a feeling I've seen it somewhere before. Well, shall we have our brandy on the terrace? Excuse me. Rotten, corrupted, decadent! Why, it is intolerable that we should be forced to deal with you. No, it's you who are intolerable. Intolerably stupid, dull, overbearing... Veronica, please. Mr. Walters, I must ask you to refrain from addressing my wife in such a manner. Oh, I address your wife as she deserves. Drunk in every cheap bar in Havana. - She's no better than a... - My dear, please. - Oh, shut up. - Why make a scene? - You dare? You dare to slap my face? - Slap your face? - I ought to claw your eyes out. - Veronica, Walters. Be quiet, all of you. There are other people in the house. - Really? - What people? Should we have come earlier, Max, or later? You're not supposed to return till tomorrow. - Why have you come back tonight? - Because I insisted on it. - I told them, Max. I told them we shouldn't. - Never mind now, Franz. Since you are here, I suggest you come in and meet my friends. And try to appear normal. I'm afraid it sounded like a native uprising, but it was only my houseguests returning from a long journey. - This is Mrs. Huebling. Mrs. Emery. - Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Emery? - And her brother-in-law. - I heard so much about you. I hope we're not too late for the floor show. When does it go on? Well, it seems to be on right now. Why, Max, she's witty as well. How nice for you. I must apologize for Veronica. She has a tendency to be rude when she's tired. I'm not tired. I'm slightly drunk. Oh, hello. Max didn't tell me anything about you. - Veronica, my dear. - Oh, stop picking at me like a sparrow. What a wonderful world. At 7:00 this evening, we're all hating each other in Jamaica, and now, only three hours later, we're loathing each other in Trinidad. Thank you, Max. Veronica, some people are mellowed by drink. - I suggest you have another. - Thank you, darling. I will. But I'm not promising to pass out. Oh! - Thank you. - Veronica. Excuse me. - This is my good friend Peter Bronec. - How do you do? Mr. Emery, Mr. Bronec. - Yes, we came down on the plane together. - Oh? Feeling better, Mr. Bronec? Yes, yes, of course. You didn't tell me you were ill, Peter. I was not ill, Max. - It is just sometimes on the plane that I... - You're stammering again. - No, I'm not. I... - Quite badly. Let's hope this little vacation will cure that. If you'll excuse me, I have some letters to write. - This is Mr. Walters. - How do you do? And Dr. Huebling. How do you do, Mr. Emery? - Dr. Franz Huebling? - Yes. Didn't you write some articles on the V-2 rocket just after the war? Oh, I used to dabble. Just a few little experiments. All outdated now, like the spinning wheel. - You are interested in such matters? - Yeah, I used to dabble a bit myself, flying a B-29. Franz, you must all be hungry. Why don't you tell the chef to fix you something? Yes, Max, of course. And you, Mr. Walters, you can join us later if you're not too tired. We'll be on the terrace. Shall we go? Don't be so greedy, Max. You can show Mrs. Emery the moonlight, but I'm keeping Mr. Emery here with me. You don't mind, do you? I'm sure they don't. Besides, you wouldn't want me to drink by myself, would you? I've been cooped up in Max's plane for three hours with three very dull men. But you're not dull. Oh. You are dull. Any man who can't keep his eyes off another woman is dull. Might have known you'd be in love with her. Oh, yes. You're in love with her, and so is Max, and who knows how many others? What is it about her? Is it that dance she does? Maybe I ought to learn to dance. And let me see. What is it she does? A chick a chick boom chick boom A chick a chick boom chick boom A chick a chick boom chick boom Chris, there are so many things I've wanted to say to you. When Neal was alive, I couldn't. But now... Surely you must know how I feel. No, Max, I don't. I thought the symptoms were rather obvious. The young man inside recognized them. - Steve? - Yes. And he didn't like them. He's jealous. But I can't blame him. I'm jealous, too. Oh, but you shouldn't be. Chris, I'll be leaving Trinidad as soon as my affairs here are settled, - and I was hoping that... - Affairs? I thought you were a man of leisure. I could be, if it would please you. Well, why should you rearrange your life for me? I want to, for both of us. We could do anything you like, go wherever you like. Paris, Cairo, Seville... Oh, it sounds wonderful, Max, but, well, how can I decide so quickly? There's so little I know about you. You know that I couldn't stay away from the Caribe while you were there, that I came every night for months because of you. - And you must know that... - I suddenly feel cold. Funny, isn't it, on a night like this? No, wait here. I'll get your scarf. I want to finish this conversation. I told him nothing on the plane. Nothing, I swear it. - Why get upset? - None of you believe me. - Of course we believe you. - Why must I stay? I have done everything I promised. My work is almost finished. - Could you complete it this evening? - Yes. I'll work all night if I have to. Then you can leave in the morning. Thank you. Thank you, Max. Max! You must get your friends out of this house immediately. Why? Has some new calamity arisen? We had to carry Mrs. Huebling upstairs, and your friend Mr. Emery is with her. That woman is not responsible. She might say anything in her drunken babbling. I'll be up in a moment. Meantime, even at the risk of dislocating your personality, try to be calm. Chris? I'm sorry I kept you waiting, but we seem to be having some sort of domestic crisis. Mrs. Huebling is in quite a state, for some reason or other. Oh. Well, perhaps it would be better if Steve and I left. Yes, perhaps it would. I'm terribly sorry. - There'll be other evenings. - I hope so. As a matter of fact, I'm giving a birthday party next Thursday. Your being here would give me something to celebrate. - Will you come? - I'd love to. Good. You shouldn't have left, Mr. Walters. She had some very interesting things to say about you. She's a very sick woman, very sick. Did you two use up all the moonlight? We're leaving, Steve. Leaving? Why? I thought you were having such a good time. Well, I'm tired and it's rather late. I'm sorry this was not a more successful evening, Mr. Emery. Well, I know how hard you tried. Better luck next time. Mr. Emery. Good night, sir. - Good night, Doctor. - And thank you very much. Anytime. This whole situation is becoming impossible. I'm in the midst of a nightmare. A nightmare! Where else could we meet? And your wife! Can't you control this woman? You don't understand her. I understand her only too well. Now perhaps you can explain to me why you returned tonight. Because I found out your man was captured trying to get into the United States. Now how do you intend to proceed? My government is tired of all these endless delays. If your government isn't satisfied, it can go elsewhere. But we pay you tremendous sums of money. - You made an investment. - And we don't intend to lose it. What possessed you to bring those people into the house? The young man is already suspicious. He recognized Huebling. He saw Bronec gibbering like an idiot. Bronec leaves tomorrow. His work is finished. He's in no condition to leave. The man is on the verge of a mental breakdown. I said his work is finished. As for his condition, that will be corrected. - And Mr. Emery is my concern. - Very well. But I warn you, if anything goes wrong, you will be held responsible. Remember that. Walked out again. I believe it's a national characteristic. Coming up to see me, Max? I'm feeling much better, thank you. Could I have a nightcap? What did you say in front of that young man? Nothing, Max. Nothing. How do you know, since you were practically unconscious? I was there, Max, every minute. - You took care of everything in Jamaica? - Yes, everything. I bought the land in my name, just as you said. You told them you were an impoverished noblewoman? - Yes. - And that you were looking for a piece of land on which to settle down quietly with your sick husband? - Yes, Max. That's what you told me to say. - And you think they believed you? Of course they believed me. Ask Franz. Why shouldn't they? Because impoverished noblewomen don't go about wearing strings of pearls worth $50,000. - My pearls! - I told you to leave them here. Please, Max. Veronica, leave them. I'll get them for you. And don't look to me for help when your visa expires. I'm through with you and your drunkenness. - Max, you can't. - You go to the guesthouse and help Bronec. He must finish his work tonight, you understand? Yes, Max. Well? Oh, Max, please. Good night, sir. Okay, you can tell your boss. We didn't even hold hands. I think we could have gotten along without that last remark, don't you? Well, I wouldn't want Mr. Fabian to spend a sleepless night. All right, Steve, you've been saving it up for hours. Say it. No. I'm waiting to hear how you'd say it. - You're a trusting soul, aren't you? - Not any more. Not after tonight. Why didn't you tell me you had a date with Fabian? I meant to, but I forgot. You forgot a lot of things. You forgot to tell me he was a friend of yours as well as Neal's, that he bought Neal's paintings. Did you also forget to tell me he bought Neal's wife? The rain woke me. Get you up, too? Yes, the rain. I'm leaving tomorrow. Leaving? Yeah. You won't have to put up with any more of my insults. Steve, the things you believe about me, - they're not true. - Forget it. You don't have to account to me for anything. But I want to. Then why didn't you tell me about the crest, about Fabian, about everything? What is it between you and him? There's nothing between us. Is that why he looks at you the way he does? Like he can't wait to get his arms around you? I can't help how he looks at me. But his arms have never been around me. Nobody's arms. Not for a long time. Not even Neal's? Not even Neal's. Well, weren't you in love with him? I was once, but love is something that has to be kept alive, and it wasn't. Oh, Chris. Oh, Steve, Steve. Every time he looked at you tonight, I could have... If anybody looked at you... Oh, Chris. Come back to the States with me. But I can't now, Steve. - Why not? - Don't ask me. I just can't. What's wrong, Chris? Nothing. Nothing, but... I'll come to you later, if you want me to, as soon as I can. What is this, another of those phony stalls I've been getting since I come down here? Oh, you know it isn't. How do I know? Steve. Very interesting. Very. But what exactly do you expect me to do about this? I expect you to do your job. Look at the date on that letter. That was written on the day my brother died, on Fabian's stationery. And he said he hadn't seen him for weeks. Look, what's the matter? You guys have to have a bomb go off under you before you do anything? Mr. Emery, there has been a thorough investigation of all the facts. What facts? You mean the ones at the inquest? Back home, they ask more questions when a dog's run over. Why don't you go up and look around Fabian's house? The place is crawling with phony characters. And that job my brother wrote about, how do you know that wasn't for Fabian? He has a private plane. Mr. Emery, you have a decided flair for the dramatic. Twenty or thirty wealthy residents have private planes. You can't arrest people for being phony. As for this stationery, your brother could have got it from Fabian's house at any time, not necessarily on the day of his death. You've got an alibi for everything, haven't you? Well, maybe you can alibi the way Fabian acts around my brother's wife. Frankly, I consider that an item for the gossip columns, not for Her Majesty's police. What's the matter? Fabian got you in his pocket, too? I must caution you, Mr. Emery, that libel is a very serious matter. So is murder. I think you'd be wise to go home and leave this to the authorities. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Yeah, too many of you guys want me to go home. Give me that. I'll keep that, if you don't mind. I wouldn't want it to disappear. - I certainly wish we could tell him. - So do I. But I have my orders. Until he's cleared, we can tell him nothing. Don't worry, Mr. Anderson. We're checking on him. We should be hearing very soon. At the moment, I'm much more concerned with Mr. Fabian's houseguests. - Yes, sir? - Get me Mrs. Emery. And that's the man who was working in the guesthouse. Bronec. Peter Bronec. Bronec. Bronec. Yes, here he is. Peter Bronec, electronics and radar specialist. Quite a brilliant one. Huebling and Bronec. What can Fabian want with those two? If you could only get into that guesthouse. But how? Well, perhaps the night of the birthday party. There'll be quite a lot of people milling about, and you might... But I couldn't possibly get in. It would be locked. - Yes? - Bronec's leaving. Pan-American, 11:00 A.M. - Oh, he is? Good. - We've got it confirmed. Bronec's leaving on the 11:00 plane. We'll have to hurry. I want to have a talk with him. He seems to be in quite a state. Perhaps I shall be able to get something out of him. But what about Steve? Mr. Emery? I've got to tell him something. Call me this afternoon. I may have some word for you by then. I know, but I'm worried. He may get into trouble. Just be patient, Mrs. Emery, for a little while longer. Yes, yes. And thank you. You've done very well. Very well indeed. - Morning, Baker. - Morning, Inspector. - Has a Mr. Bronec come through yet? - Bronec? - No, but he has a reservation. - Yes, I know. Thank you. He ought to be along soon if he intends to catch that plane. There's Fabian's car now. That's him. Get after that car, quickly. What are you staring at? Get an ambulance. I'll get it, Dominique. - Hello? - Mrs. Emery? Yes. Mr. Bronec is dead. What? Yes. He was run over by a car at the airport about half an hour ago. It's obvious he was murdered. Of course, Mr. Fabian was shocked and horrified to hear what had happened to his guest. But this time, I think he's been a little hasty. I have great hopes of tracing the car. My men are on it now. Oh, by the way, I found something among Mr. Bronec's effects which I think may be of use, a set of keys. I think you may be able to get into that guesthouse after all. Well, I'll try. Good. Well, I'll get the keys to you at once. Incidentally, is Mr. Emery there? Well, no, he isn't. He left the house early this morning, and I haven't heard from him since. Well, we can tell him what the situation is now, but I think you'd better let me do it. Ask him to come in and see me, will you? - Yes, I will. - Thank you. Bye. You are mixed up in something bad. What is it? Nothing, nothing. Since when you keep your life a secret from me? Oh, Dominique, please! Let me alone. But you must know more about it. You found his body on the boat. Where was he going? Where had he been? Somebody must know. - You say you're his brother? - I told you three times I'm his brother. Now, if you know something, why can't you tell me? If you could find Jefreemy Bates, maybe he... - Jefreemy Bates? Who's he? - Please, you will not say who told you. No, I won't say anything if you don't want me to. Who's he? What does he know about it? He's a fisherman from the island of Tobago. After your brother was found, he went to the police station. He was there a long time. Then later he'd say nothing. But if you told him you were his brother... How do you get to this island? The dock master may know someone who will take you there, sir. Thank you. Not him. It is the chauffeur. Mr. Fabian's chauffeur. Why should Mr. Emery go away for three days and not tell you? Oh, I suppose he had his reasons. You do not want to go to Mr. Fabian's house tonight, do you? Then why do you go? Let me send the car away. It's too late, Dominique. If he does come back tonight, tell him that I... Never mind. - You look stunning this evening, my dear. - Thank you. What a lovely handkerchief. Is this what you were shopping for yesterday, Max? What a quaint idea, giving Mrs. Emery a gift on your birthday. Shouldn't she have brought you something? She brought herself. I want to see Mrs. Emery. I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think Mr. Fabian is expecting you. There's a lot of things Mr. Fabian isn't expecting. You can't come in here. Excuse me. Good evening, Mr. Emery. To what do we owe this intrusion? It belongs to a friend of yours. Give it back to him. Maybe there's somebody else he wants to stab in the back. What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? And I have a few things to say to you, but not here. Get Mrs. Emery's wrap. This is my house, Mr. Emery. If there's anything you want, I suggest you address yourself to me. I'll get to you later. Well, are you coming or not? I'm not ready to leave. All right, then, you'll hear what I have to say now, both of you. I have a statement here signed by a fisherman by the name of Jefreemy Bates, a statement that says my brother was in this house on the day he died. Have you got an alibi for that? - Do you mind? - Yes, I mind. I'm tired of listening to stories about how my brother committed suicide. I'm using this to light a fire under you and the police. Oh, Max, he's been drinking. He doesn't know what he's saying. He's got all kinds of crazy ideas about Neal's death. Let me talk to him alone, please. Let's not have a scene. All right, but I'll be nearby. Oh, Steve, you've got to get out of here. I'll explain everything later, but you must leave now. Why? Give you and him a chance to figure a way out of this? Oh, no, no. You knew Neal was here on the day he died, didn't you? But I can't talk about it now. Don't you understand? I understand you've been lying to me ever since I got here. All right. If you want the truth, you can have it. Sure, I knew he was here that day, because I was here, too, with Max. That's why he killed himself, because he found out about Max and me. Now, will you get out? Well, what do you want, another signed statement? I'll give you one to take home and frame. Thank you. This party's turning into a wake. Let's have some entertainment. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, the Trinidad Lady! Fasten your safety belts! I've been kissed before Arms have held me fast You can tell by my kiss You weren't the first And you won't be the last With heart and soul I kiss them And file the memory under M Tomorrow, if I miss them That may be the only time I think about them I've been kissed before Only fools tell when I was born to be kissed To kiss and be kissed And I'll be kissed again A heart is broken nightly A smile that they misunderstood Unless you treat it lightly You'd better be going While the going is good Many loves have I You were just one more But someday I'll be kissed And maybe I'll doubt That I've been kissed before That I've been loved before On that day that I'm kissed I'll even deny That I've been kissed before Oh, many loves have I You were just one more But someday I'll be kissed And maybe I'll doubt That I've been kissed before That I've been loved before On that day that I'm kissed I'll even deny That I've been kissed before That was my birthday present to you, Max. I hope you liked it. I couldn't think of a more exciting way to begin a new year. Are you still here? What are you waiting for? Max, don't. Let him go. I'm sick of seeing him around. You don't know what sick is. Happy birthday, sucker. What did you say to him before? I told him he was making a fool of himself. Well, I shouldn't think that would produce such startling results. I also told him I was going away with you. He's so jealous, he can't see straight. Max, I don't want to go back to that house tonight. Could I stay here? Of course. I'll tell the housekeeper to prepare a room for you. Here you are, darling. Welcome to our city. What has happened? Why did she not come back with you? Why should she? She belongs where she is. Max, most important. Will you excuse me, please, Chris? It's incredible, Max, incredible. Well, is it what we have been waiting for? I must check these figures at once. Come. Mr. Fabian, will you want me to take off again tonight? I'll let you know. Olaf, see that he gets something to eat. Yes, sir. It will only take me a few minutes. Well, Mr. Walters, you may be able to leave very soon now. Good, good. Good. Why do you leave these papers lying about in the open? Don't be alarmed. They're meaningless to anybody but Franz. His own mathematical shorthand. Never have I seen matters conducted as they are here. Never. - Well, Franz? - It's correct, Max, correct. And so clear, so simple. You see, the principle of the power center is what... I'm not interested in details. How soon can we start production? At once, if your government has the technical resources. - And is it all we have been led to believe? - More. I will explain it so that even you can understand it. The German V-2, of which we were so proud, was a kindergarten toy compared to this. With launching bases in the Caribbean, there is not a vital area in the United States that is not within striking distance. Let me show you. Here. Chicago, San Francisco, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, New York. Excellent, excellent. In case of war, your country could strike a blow that would make Pearl Harbor seem like a slap on the wrist, and using America's own weapon, if the irony interests you. Yes, yes. Well, Mr. Walters, have I earned my money? Max, remember, it was I who urged my government to make this deal with you. - Yes? - It's Veronica. The entertainment's over, Max, and your guests are leaving. Unless you can persuade Mrs. Emery to do another number for us, I suggest you come and say good night. Is there anything else, Franz? No. You go along, Max. I'll stay and do a little work. - Coming, Mr. Walters? - Yes, yes. Good night. Thank you. Good night. Veronica, do you know where Mrs. Emery is? No. Am I supposed to? Chris. I was wondering where you'd disappeared to. Oh, I was just getting some fresh air. Well, what's become of my little gift? Oh, well, I... Oh, well, I must have lost it someplace. - Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Max. I... - Don't be upset. One of the servants will find it before morning. Come. I'll show you to your room. - Max? - Yes? I was just thinking, I really should go home. But why this sudden change of heart? Oh, nothing. It's just that... Well, I won't have anything to wear tomorrow, and I... Oh, is that all? I'm sure Veronica will lend you whatever you need. Of course. I have some lovely things Max gave me that I've never even worn. - But I... - I won't hear of your leaving now. Come. I suppose she could have decided to stay the night. Take a look at that, will you? All right, you can bring Mr. Wittol back in. This is ridiculous, Inspector, ridiculous. Why should we spend the whole night here? Look at your friend, how tired he is. Inspector, I tell you, I didn't even know this man Bronec existed. Why should I kill him? Inspector, do you think it's my psychology to run a man down with an automobile? The world is filled with such fascinating methods of destruction. Why should I commit such a clumsy murder? Yes, it is clumsy, but it's also very bold, and you're neither. That's why I'm sure somebody was behind you in this. Who was it? Please. I am not a man for alliances. Yet you admitted that the car that ran over Bronec was yours. It was stolen. My driver had his day off. He left the key in the car. Personally, I can't even drive. Why didn't you report the theft? - Because the car was returned. - How convenient. Why didn't you report the fact that there was blood on the mudguards when it was returned? Blood? I... Well, I didn't know it. I told the boy to wash the car, but... Who looks for blood? No, Mr. Wittol. It was not your driver's day off, because you don't give him a day off. And you were both seen driving towards the airport shortly before the murder. That's not true. You are trying to confuse me. - Yes? - Chauffeur has given us a full confession. Thank you. Well, Mr. Wittol, you can stop being confused, because your driver doesn't seem to be as inventive as you are. For the last five minutes, he's been able to think of nothing but the truth. Now, are you prepared to make a statement, Mr. Wittol? Yes. Yes, sir. I tell you everything. But you must remember that I am just a pawn. I'm a weak man. I am very easily dominated. Is everything all right, Doctor? Why, yes, Olaf. Excellent, in fact. Why? I thought I heard something. No. Well, good night, sir. Good night, Olaf. I wouldn't do that if I were you. I have some bad news for you, Max. I'd like to break it to you gently, but I simply don't know how. What bad news? Franz found this. The poor darling thought it was mine. So? But do you know where he found it? In the guesthouse. Really, Max, to be taken in like a schoolboy. Is this what you're looking for? Yes? It is past 3:00 and still she is not here. Well, maybe she decided to spend the night. Why should that keep you up? She's done it before, hasn't she? That is your anger speaking again. You are leaving? Why? You really don't know what's been going on, do you? Please speak straight, Mr. Emery. What is it I do not know? I'm talking about her and Max Fabian. - This is a lie. - Oh, is it? Well, she told me so herself. Even so, she lied. For what reason I do not know. Mr. Emery, you think two women could live in the same house and such a thing be kept a secret? I tell you, there is some terrible trouble here. She did not want to go to Mr. Fabian's house tonight. She is afraid of something, not only for herself, but for you. You must not turn away from her now. Is that true? You are planning to take Mrs. Emery with us? There's room on the plane, and I thought it would lend something to our trip. Ridiculous. Hasn't your stupid infatuation given us enough trouble? If you disapprove of the traveling arrangements, you can stay here. Don't worry, Mr. Walters. Max will know how to dispose of her. He has a real flair for that sort of thing. As soon as Franz is ready, we'll leave with Mrs. Emery. Ask Olaf to bring her down. Excuse me, Mr. Fabian. Will that be all, sir? - Yes. We'll be out in a few minutes. - Yes, sir. - See what that is. - Yes, sir. I think I'll have one for the road. It's all right, Count. Well, can we go now? It's dangerous to wait any longer. Max, there isn't any real chance of our being caught, is there? I mean, it would sort of take the fun out of everything. Well, Chris, our little journey may not be as gay as the one we planned, but I promise you it won't be dull. Relax, Mr. Fabian. Steve. You're not going anywhere. Oh, Steve! Steve, I... It's all right. You can tell me about it later. You're a very determined intruder, Mr. Emery. That's right. Come on, let's get out of here. Don't rush off. There's something I'd like to ask you before you leave, if you don't mind. Have you also enlisted as a British agent? What, didn't you know? Mrs. Emery has been deceiving both of us with a third party. Her Majesty's police, no less. What government do you represent? Or are you here simply in the role of a private citizen? Steve! Steve! - We must get out of here at once. - Just a moment. Max. Max, you're hurt! We'll have to delay our departure. Olaf, take her upstairs. Lock her in my room. Veronica, some brandy. Franz, quickly. Max, I... I don't think there's any point in your waiting, after all. Max! Franz, there must be something we... No. It would be wiser if you all left at once. What do we do with him? You don't want us to leave him here. Take him along. I don't want him in this house. His presence here offends me. Olaf, I'm remaining here. You'll see to it that Mr. Emery leaves with you. Yes, sir. As for Mrs. Emery, I myself will make the necessary arrangements concerning her. Under the circumstances, I think it only fitting. Olaf. Take him out. If you're waiting for my last words, you've heard them. Come on. We can't wait here any longer. - Max, we can't leave you this way. - Veronica, please. Taking a last look at Trinidad? You know, you're gonna find Chicago kind of cold after the tropics. Am I?
