[ Barks ] [ Grunts ] That package is ours! It could be my new ballistic nylon chew toy! Oh, you better retreat, or I'll rip a hole in your blue Bermudas! Hey, Marley. [ Chuckling ] Thanks for breaking in my new kicks. Dude! That's my specialty. [ Woman ] Bodi. [ Marley Narrating ] That's my boy Bodi. I'm hanging with him this summer 'cause my parents are working. Hes cool. I can mess up his bed. shred his leather chew toys. He doesn't care. [ Whining ] [ Chuckles ] Bodi, it's time to go. - Are those your new shoes? - Uh- [ Chuckles ] Marley did a little work on it. [ Sighs ] Bad dog, Marley. Bodi, I told you you can't leave your shoes lying around when there's a puppy in the house. I mean, when are you gonna learn to take responsibility for your things? No biggie. I can still wear them. Oh. Good. 'Cause I'm not buying you another pair till college. [ Marley Narrating ] That's his mom, Ms. Grogan. She's a little tense. She found out I was playing with those doggie-sized pillows on her coach. and it sent her on this kick about Bodi needing to be more responsible. uh! Whatever that means. [ Chuckles ] Oh. I see you haven't found his leash. Uh- Yeah. We gotta go. A long drive to Grandpa's. Grandpa? You mean the wrinkled guy? Okay. Let's go. Want to go for a car ride, Marley? [ Barks ] Get the door. Car ride? Oh. Right. Yeah! [ Barking ] [ Pop ] [ Man ] Get ready, set, go  Nothing will get into the way  Get ready, set, go  Keep runnin' and enjoy the day Let nothin' get in your way  Oh. Marley. Bodi, don't let him climb on your face like that. - Hey, hey, Dad. Yeah. We're on our way. - Are you gonna be late? No. We're good. My flight doesn't leave till 4:00. I don't know why she has to go to a leadership conference. She could organize the Super Bowl blindfolded. Oh, Marley! Was that you? [ Grandpa ] Is Bodi bringing a friend? Oh, no, no, Dad. Marley is John and Jenny's new puppy. I told you we're dog sitting while they're on that writing assignment. It's a big mistake, by the way. [ Insect Buzzing ] Bug. [ Chomping ] - Mmm. Crunchy. - Get ready, set, go  Nothing will get into the way  [ Doorbell Rings ] - Hi, guys. - Hi. Dad. Hey, Grandpa. Yep. It's the wrinkled guy. Come on in. Oh. Watch it. Marley. Hi. Hi. All right. So. here we have some general information... on Marley's naughty habits that you should be aware of. Keep in mind that he does really like to chew pretty much everything. so keep your favorite things oat of reach. Whoo! Hey, look at this backyard! And- Where is Marley? He's right- He was just- [ Chuckles ] I'll find him. Uh-hah. Marley? [ Barking ] There you are. Hey, Bodi. Check this out. [ Farts ] Ahhh! Jacuzzi! [ Chuckles ] Marley! Come on. Come on. Marley. And make sure he gets out and meets some of the neighborhood kids. [ Bodi Chuckling ] Stop it. You are such a troublemaker. Mom, when you get back, can I get my own dog? Uh, when you prove you're responsible enough. we can talk about it. Why is he wet? I'm totally responsible. Uh-hah. You've already lost Marley's leash, let him chew one of your new shoes, and I don't even want to know why my pillows are suddenly smelling fanny. What if I can train Marley by the time you get back? Well, that would be a miracle. - So it's a deal? - What? - If I can train Marley. - Sure. Now you- You be good for Grandpa. Don't let him play too many video games, and, you know, maybe you can work with him on his follow-through. It would be really- I'll whip him into shape. You just worry about catching your flight. Oh. Right. Okay. Okay. Bye. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Love you. Love you too. This is gonna be great. We can get away with all kinds of stuff with Grandpa. Hes old. I heard that. Sorry. Now listen up, cadets. I may look like an old geezer, bat I'm a decorated war hero, and I don't take flak from anybody. So you toe the line, and we'll get along just fine. [ Marley Narrating ] Aw. the wrinkled gay. I was pretty little when we met. but I remember he got really bent when I gnawed on his arm. I was teething. you know. He hasn't changed much. Still grumpy and still wrinkled. Follow me. Who spiked his prune juice? Mm-hmm! I heard that too. [ Grandpa ] All right. Now- When I'm sitting in this chair and the game is on, the remote is mine. Copy that. And no dogs on the coach. Really? - Right? - [ Marley Barks ] - This way. - [ Whimpers ] There's an auxiliary toilet in here. Come on. I'll show you where you can store your skateboard. Extra drinking fountain, check. [ Sniffing ] I smell leather shoe toys! mm. [ Sniffing ] That smells like Spam! I love this place. Ooh. Ooh. Spam! Ooh. Spam! [ Chuckles ] Ooh. Spam! Now, the bedrooms in this house are kept neat. There it is. And that means the bed's made, clothes and shoes properly stowed. There are some extra towels in here. I thought this was supposed to be summer vacation, not boot camp. Did you hear that? Yep. [ Marley Grunting ] I was just making a sandwich. Do you want one? Sure. Weill, that's strange. What happened to my Spam? [ Murmurs ] Wow. - Lucky dog! - This might be a good time for a dog walk. Come on, Marley. [ Barks ] Yeah, Marley! You've got some serious torque! Inhale, exhale. Oh, yeah! I'm bad! Hey! Wait ap. Thank you. Whoa. Slow down! Whoa! Watch out! Whoa! [ Groans ] Huh. Airmail. [ Groaning ] - [ Girl ] Are you gays okay? - You again! That's our package! [ Groans ] [ Growling ] Marley, no. Marley, get out. Don't touch the mail. [ Barks ] [ Barking ] I'm really sorry. Marley can get out of control sometimes. That's all right. I'm Kaycee Ellis. Bodi Grogan. [ Chuckles ] [ Giggles ] Grogan. Your grandfather lives down the street, right? Yeah. Hey. Was that crazy, or what? Not funny. Whoa! Easy. You almost got me into trouble. Sorry. I had to battle the evil mailman. [ Growls ] Well. I'm in training. That's my girl Godiva. Ahhh, that's good. Right behind the ear. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She's the leader of the agility team called the Burkaneers. Agility team? Yeah. We leap, we jump, we weave- - And chase cats? - Uh, no. Yeah, we're getting ready for the Ultimate Pappy Championship. They're holding it at Summerville Arena. - That sounds fan. - Yeah, it does! It's awesome. - Hey, maybe I could enter Marley. - You could, but you need two other dogs to make a team. They just can't be older than a year. I totally want to run, jump, leap and chase cats. Hello. Theres no cats. You could try Mrs. Crouch. She has two Lab puppies. It's the white house at the end of the block. Thanks. Maybe I'll do that. Come on. Just don't get any ideas about beating us. Come on. What do you think, Marley? [ Murmurs ] Yeah. youse a good dog. Yeah. [ Birds Chirping ] [ Female Voice ] Hey, tubby? [ Male Voice ] What? I hear someone. Why don't you stop feeding your face and see who it is. Why don't you get off your lazy butt and see for yourself? 'Cause I'm sunbathing. Well. I'm snacking. Okay. fine. I'll go. Maybe it's somebody cool. Wait a minute. I want to see. You know, they're probably oat back here. Oh. [ Chuckles ] There they are. [ Bodi Chuckles ] Who's he? Don't know. Hiya. Hi. guys. Hey, pap. [ Chuckles ] [ Barking Playfully ] So what do you say, Mrs. Crouch? [ Sniffing ] I could pick them up in the morning for training. Uh, what are you doing? I smell Spam. Mmm! [ Chuckles ] Wow. Youre good. No, he's just obsessed with meat. It sounds like this competition might be just what your puppies need. Well, I guess I don't see any harm in them joining your agility team. - Awesome. - And I gotta wear this thing for another three weeks. - We're gonna be a team? - What? I'm not teaming up with that woof. Hes a total goob. No, he's not. Uh, hello. I'm right here. Sorry, bro. My name is Moose. You know, like the dorky, furry beast. And that's my annoying sister Fuchsia. I'm Marley, like the reggae singer. ''Yah, man.'' Who da man? You da man. - We're jammin'! - Oh, brother. You're Marley da man. You're Moose da man. Whoo-hoo! [ Groans ] I think I'm gonna toss my biscuits. [ Marley ] We be jammin', man! [ Man ] Taylor's got to get through the tire, hurdles. teeter-totters- What am I looking at here? It's the Ultimate Puppy Championship I told you about. Marley, off. National competition- Isn't this cool? And the winner gets a huge sponsorship. [ Grandpa ] Well. that sounds good. ...thirty-five seconds. I was thinking if I could train Marley for this competition, then Mom would let me get my own dog. Well, that's a lot of work. You make a commitment. you're gonna have to see it through. I will. [ Bell Dings ] Dinner. Can I... build a practice course in the backyard? Sure. After you finish your chores. What chores? Hey, wrinkled guy! I'm on the couch! I can do that! ...making it that much more difficult. [ Crowd Cheers ] In the dive competition, a dog will do anything- I'm so agile, I will stupefy you! Whoa! Oops! [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Whimpering ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Whining. Whimpering ] [ Whimpering Continues ] Sorry, Marley. Grandpa says you have to sleep in here. [ Whimpers ] It's only a little thunder and lightning. [ Whimpers ] Works every time. [ Bodi Laughing ] [ Barks ] Shh! Keep it down. Grandpa's got Spider-Man hearing. [ Clears Throat ] No dogs on the bed. No worries. I got this. [ Whimpering ] Time to man up, pap. [ Whimpers ] [ Marley Howling ] [ Birds Chirping ] [ Grunting ] My work is done here! Now I'm thirsty. Bingo. [ Grunting ] [ Snoring ] mm? Nice! Marley! Hey! Marley, what are you doing on the bed? You're all wet! [ Marley Narrating ] Hey. What's with the face? I thought Grandpa would like an early-morning splatter. He's a marine, isn't he? They're used to getting wet. [ Groans ] [ Shouts ] Help me! [ Screaming ] Marley! If anyone needs me, I'll be oat mowing the lawn. [ Chattering ] Hey. Are you throwing that oat? [ Pop ] [ Barks ] [ Woman ] I see you just about every other day  - [ Whimpers ] - Sometimes you look at me  - Whoa! - At times you turn away  - I think it's kind of cute  - [ Whimpers ] This little game that you play  [ Grunting ] Just about to change your world  What you have been looking for  - The world is rising up  - [ Barks ] Just about to change your world  Yeah  [ Tires Squealing ] Hey. What's this? I thought you were building that agility course. I am. How? By remote control? Come on. You gotta finish what you started. [ Murmurs ] Hmm? Agility weave poles set. [ Whimpers ] [ Murmurs ] [ Whimpers ] Duct tape. [ Grunts ] Is that a beaver? I think it's a chipmunk. No, it's our future. Tire jump. - Teeter-totter, weave poles, walk-over. jump-- - [ All Whimpering ] Tunnel. [ Laughs ] Well, team, who wants to go first? Whoa! mm? [ Sighs ] [ Murmuring ] [ Barks ] Weill, go ahead and say it. Your dead chipmunk is squashing my azaleas. Anything else? Yeah. You didn't finish the lawn, and you forgot to make your bed. Other than that, it was a good effort. Okay then. Come on, guys. You want to see something cool? Sure! [ Barks ] [ Grandpa Clears Throat ] - What? - You call that making a bed? Now that's how you make a bed. Stupid to make the bed if I'm just gonna mess it up again. [ Grandpa ] I heard that. [ Sighs ] [ Water Burbling In Pipe ] [ Murmurs ] What is it? Don't know. Whatever it is, it's not edible. I've already tried. [ All Gasp ] Whoa! Whoa! [ Fuchsia ] Aaah! My fur! [ Grunting ] Mmm! [ Marley ] Go ahead, Moose. I dare you to look through there. - Hmm. - [ Fuchsia ] Moose, what are you doing? - What's over there? - Let me see. [ French Accent ] My name is Cat! Cat! [ Farts ] Ew! - [ Coughing ] - [ Groans ] Sorry. [ Sniffing ] Oh, oh! You did not blow that nasty in my- [ Coughing ] Let's book! Yeah. it's stinky over there! Sorry, gays! Cats give me gas! [ Dogs Barking Playfully ] Oh. That's just great. mm? - [ Groans ] - Ooh. Not good. Gays, I think we might be in over our heads with this competition. [ Dog Whimpers, Murmurs ] Is he bailing on us? Sounds like it. No way. Bodi's not a quitter. See? He came back to clean up. Hey, come on, guys. Let's help him. Check this out! This could be us and Bodi with the trophy! Whoa! Could it really? Cool! [ Whimpering, Barking ] Hey. You've already had breakfast. ''ans von Weiselberger and the Woof Gang, reigning Ultimate Puppy Champions.'' Yeah. Would have been great. but- [ Marley Whimpering ] [ All Whimpering ] I tried, guys. It's not gonna happen. Hey. What's all this? Complete failure. I can't train Marley. I can't even build a stupid coarse. Well, maybe you're trying to do too much. Mom does like a million things at once- perfectly. She wasn't always perfect, you know. She wasn't? No, not even close. I remember when she was your age, she wanted a hamster. Mom had a hamster? Yeah. I think his name was Ernie. [ Laughs ] Ernie. But first she had to prove that she could take care of him, and believe me, she had a terrible time. You know how hard it is to train a hamster? [ Chuckles ] Probably not as hard as these gays. [ Chuckles ] Don't give up, son. I think Marley's a lot smarter than a hamster. Yeah, he is. I think you can do it. Thanks, Grandpa. [ Lawn Mower Whirs ] All right. I'm not completely useless. I can still mow a stupid lawn. Sorry. I accidentally killed your Times. Whoa! Way to shred, Bodi! Ah, forget it. Come on. Let's go. Where are we going? First thing you learn in the military is always know your enemy. - What enemy? - The mailman! The Woof Gang and their trainer- ''Weasel Barger.'' You're not the only one that knows how to Google, you know. [ Chuckles ] Come on. Cool. Bat it's Weiselberger. All right, men. Get in, get the intel and get out. - Wow. - [ Grandpa ] Pretty swanky. Those sponsors must pay some big money. - [ Barks ] - Shh! Sorry. A little excited. [ Panting ] - Wait. You aren't coming? - Me? This is your project. Here. Keep in touch. Hey. Come on. Marley. [ Man On Radio ] Here comes the 3-1 pitch. Curveball outside. Thats the second walk this game for Hansen. [ Marley Grunting ] [ Grunting ] mm? We've moved around back to get a better visual. Roger that. [ Gasps ] Scary big dog! - [ Whimpers ] - Gotta tarn off your magnifiers. [ Shudders ] Scary little dog. Like I was saying, we mast maximize oar training. The competition is only a few weeks away. and we have not enough time. You there, I don't pay you to suntan. That mast be Weiselberger. Let's go! We have the enemy in our sights. How do they look? [ Barks ] Freaky fierce. - What are they doing? - I think they're training. [ Man On Radio ] Fernandez leads off-- Move, move, move! You ran like an old lady! [ Sighs ] Faster. Stronger. Harder! Turbo, more revolutions. [ Panting ] This ans gay looks like a real creep. I want to see some effort. Oar sponsors expect perfection. We must win, or we will lose all of this! Don't you think, Marley? [ Panting ] - Marley? - [ Grunts ] - Herr von Weiselberger? - Ja. Pace. Pace, pace! The new dog collars have arrived. Excellent. Excellent. Woof Gang, continue. You, come. [ Dogs Panting ] mm? Aha! Entry point! [ Panting ] [ Grunts ] [ German Accent ] Turbo, why do you always get the gerbil wheel? [ German Accent ] I don't. It's Liesl's turn next time. It's not fair. I'm faster than her. [ German Accent ] Are not. Let me on that thing. I'll ran circles around you. [ Panting ] Hey. I think I heard something. [ Gasps ] Creepy stuffie collection. Come on. Axel. Liesl, this way. Marley! Marley! Mayday! Mayday! Pappy missing! Where are those freaky little doggies? Hello. Right behind you. [ Gulps ] Marley! - Who are you? - Uh, if I tell you, will you promise not to kill me? [ Chuckles ] Kill you? Why would we do that? Because you're the Woof Gang. Don't worry. I'm Turbo, and this is Liesl and Axel. Pretty expensive for a little thing. I- Where's the Woof Gang? I'm not sure, bat this look like it's got a little light in it. [ Scoffs ] Oh, no. Hans is coming. You better hide. [ Whimpers ] [ Gasps ] Here he comes! What are you doing here? Hmm? [ Growling ] Hmm. enkle. [ Whimpering ] Put the collar on the test subject. Pat it on- I am invisible. - [ Whimpering ] - That one! You're not happy with the voltage collars the dogs are wearing now? - No. I want to go stronger. - Ah. - Und- - [ Beeping ] Engage. Oh. Maybe that was a little too strong. We use the ones we have. Yeah. Get me a refund. Perfect. mm? [ Whimpers ] Marley, ran! Look out! Wah! Whoa! Intruders! [ Grunts ] After them! [ Beeps ] [ Growling ] - He's going to zap us! - What do we do? Follow my lead. [ Barking ] Go, go. go! [ Grunts ] Marley, come on! Come on, Marley! Come on! Go, go, go! Get that little dog! Come on!

[ Giggles ] [ Seagulls Squawking ] Come on! Are you gonna wake up or what? Yeah! [ Chuckles ] I'm up. I'm ap. [ Whirring ] No way. Way! Grandpa's turned into MacGeezer. - What do you think? - It's awesome! I'll go get Moose and Fuchsia. Come on, Marley. [ Barks ] Cool! It's more than cool. It's arctic. I wish someone would have consulted me on the color scheme. A little pink would have been nice. [ Barking ] All right, guys. Who wants to go first? Me! [ Bodi Laughing ] [ Marley ] Get Bodi! Yeah! Yeah! Dog pile! [ Barking ] Gonna get you! Looks like fan. [ Bodi ] Hey, are you spying on me? Hey. Nice course. Thanks. I thought you could use some help. Oh. Great. Guide wires. For your weave poles. [ Chuckles ] Cool. Yes! Yes! Yes! - [ Bodi ] This way. - Yum. Yum. Yum. Ow! Ow! Ow! [ Bodi ] Hey. Over here. Come on. Oh, no! I think I chipped a nail! Aw . Yeah. Quiet. It's all right, Fuchsia. Go, go, go, go. Marley! [ Kaycee ] Good girl, Fuchsia. Yes! Yeah! That's it, boy. That's it. [ Barking ] [ Laughing ] Over here. Come on. There you go. There you go. Come on, Moose. You can do it. Go to the light! There is no light. It's scary and dark in here. And I thought I was a drama queen. [ Whimpers ] Oh! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Hey. I got ya. I got ya. Come here. Come on. Moose. I got ya. Come here, buddy. [ Moose ] When's dinner? Your dinner. Bratwurst and sauerkraut. - Again? - [ Groans ] Ick! Ja, it gives me gas. - Belch! - [ Growling ] Oh. Turbo, I'm sorry. Have I offended your palate? Axel, Liesl, would you prefer that I ran down to the 7-Eleven... and get you some Kibbles 'n Bits, ja? Ja! Hes yanking your chain. Oh, wait! I have a better idea. enkle, elga, take their plates away. No food for you dogs tonight! [ Whimpering ] [ Barks, Growls ] [ Barking ] - I don't think that they're happy about this. - Oh. - Really? Well, try this. - [ Beeps ] - [ Electricity Crackling ] - Oh! - Ow! Well, I am the master, and I will decide who's happy! Plates. [ Growling ] [ Barking ] [ All Barking ] [ Beeps ] [ All Scream ] [ Man On TV, Indistinct ] [ Engine Revving ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Beeps ] Hello? [ Mother ] Bodi? Hi. honey. Hey, Mom. Hey. How are you and Grandpa getting along? We're great. I'm making serious progress with Marley. I entered him in the Ultimate Puppy Championship. Grandpa's remote. Maybe the Dog Whisperer's on. - And Grandpa helped me build a coarse and everything. - He did? - Well, that sounds amazing. - Yeah. it is! Do you think you can come home early to see it? Aw, honey, I- I don't think so. Oh. It's okay. We can video it for you. That would be perfect. [ Grunting ] Marley, don't even think about it. Mom, can I call you back? Yeah. Sure. honey. Thanks. Love you. [ Gasps ] [ Marley Narrating ] Talk about agility! I didn't know Grandpa was so flexible. [ Chuckles ] He must do yoga. [ Ticking ] - Let's go, Marley. - Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! - All right. Fuchsia! Oh, I'm impressed! They're doing really well. - Come on, Moose. - Too high. Too high. [ Screams ] [ Chuckles ] Well, two oat of three ain't bad. [ Chuckles ] All right, Moose! [ Insect Buzzing ] Bag! [ Chomping ] No, no, no, no- No! Oh! He ate it. That is disgusting. Fueled up and ready to go! What the heck is going on here? What happened to my teeth? [ Growls ] Whoa! [ Muffled ] Uh-oh. Hey! Those are my teeth! - [ Yelps ] - Bad dog, Marley! [ Shouts ] Come here, Marley! Little bandit. These teeth will never be the same. [ Growing Playfully ] So, those aren't his real teeth? I know. right? [ Both Chuckle ] You can't tell. [ Chuckles ] Oh, look at those guys. How can you not love them? Youve gotten really good with those pups. Thanks. They've taught me a lot. Hey. How come you don't have your own dog? My mom doesn't think I'm responsible enough. Bat I'm gonna prove to her I am with this competition, or at least crash and barn trying. [ Chuckles ] I hear you. This puppy challenge is super-important for us. Really? If the Burkaneers can place at least second, we'd win a cash prize and a year's supply of dog food. It would help my family keep our Love Pug Rescue open. Your family has a dog rescue? That's cool. Well, here's to us giving it our all. Okay. All right, guys. [ Chuckles ] We've only got one week left. [ Kaycee ] Only one puppy from the team can compete in the pool dive. so we're gonna have to see which one of them can jump the farthest. Is that water chlorinated? 'Cause that would really mess with my far color. Spread oat! I'm going big. [ Shouts ] Ew! Whoa! Hey! Watch it, Orca! Awesome splash, dude. Good boy, Marley. Come on. [ Grunting ] Yeah. Come on. Okay. Fine. That was impressive. Come on. [ Shudders ] [ Grandpa On Phone ] I think you'll be surprised. He's really improving. Getting quite responsible. He is? Sounds like my boy's growing up. [ Chuckles ] Ow! Ow! [ Bodi ] It's okay. Sweetheart, are you all right? Yeah. I got your message. I'm trying to change my plane ticket... FIXED BY BSpidey87 so I can make it back in time for Bodi's competition this weekend. Oh. That's terrific. Yeah, but don't tell him. I want it to be a surprise. - My lips are zipped. - Grandpa? mm? - Is that Mom? - Hello? No. I gotta go. Bye. [ Chuckles ] Moose, you're a disaster. Hmm. He's gettin' better. [ Sighs ] He is. Let's try one more time. [ Chuckles ] So we can show Mrs. Crouch when she gets here. Where is my paper? [ Clears Throat ] [ Growling Playfully ] [ Clears Throat ] [ Clearing Throat ] [ Barks ] [ Clears Throat ] [ Whimpering, Barks ] Your Daily Press, sir . [ Sighs ] ''The Thunder From Down Under to compete in Ultimate Puppy Championship''! - Who? - The Australians! Oh! I- Ah, they must be a last-minute entry. I- [ Groans ] We must beat them, or we will be disgraced! And lose our sponsorship. Do you understand my meaning? mm? Ja. Ja. Oh! Ja. [ Chuckles ] I understand you load and clear. [ Dog Barking ] [ Chuckling ] Come on, guys! - I'll race you to the chipmunk! - [ Fuchsia ] Hey. don't push! The Rasta Rascals are in the house! What do you think? Oar team name. Why would you call them that? You know, 'cause Marley is named after Bob Marley. It's a reggae theme. Oh. Well, okay. And Mrs. Crouch is helping me make the puppies' costumes. She's pretty cool! - I've been reading about the puppy competition. - Yeah, I know. I read it. You're up bright and early, aren't you? Yep. And you should see my bed. [ Dog Barking ] You could bounce a quarter off of it. - Let's go, gays. Gotta train! - Hello! Who made you team leader? And he's off! The crowd cheers! Ahh! Whoo! And he's- - Cat! - [ Farts ] Uh, where? Ew! [ Meowing, Growling ] Uh, what's he doing? Activate super powers. When I walk like this, I am invisible. [ Laughs ] You're kidding, right? I can see your furry, ugly mug right in front of me. Oh, man! But I can still chase you! - Catch me if you can! Allez! - Gonna get you! - Come on, puppy! - Hmm? - [ Marley Grunting ] - Alley-oop! [ Barking. Grunting ] Oops. Whoo! [ Chuckling ] Whoa! [ Panting. Whining ] Hey, doggie! Is that all you got? - [ Murmurs ] - En garde! [ Laughs ] [ Marley Narrating ] Sometimes I forget I'm just a dog. I think I'm a superhero and Cat is my archenemy. But right now instead of flying it looks like I might be headed for a gnarly belly flop. Hes obsessed. He's insane. Marley, you've gotta control yourself. Marley, the puppy challenge is in two days. We're never gonna make it at this rate. You're completely untrainable. Are you sure about that? Did you see Marley's dive? If he could do that in the competition, you could rack up some serious points. - How? - [ Cat Meows ] [ Chuckles ] Um, w-wait, am I supposed to be counting or something? - Okay, Grandpa. - Set. - [ Meows ] - Cat! Don't even think about it, Moose. [ Whimpers ] Whoa! - [ Grunting ] - [ Chuckles ] Here. That-a-boy. Mm-hmm. [ Marley Grunting ] I'll be back! Thank you! Aw, that-a-boy, Marley! Come here, boy!

Moose! You've changed. I told them I was a boy. Yo, Tom, what's up with the bow on the dude dog, man? - What is up with that, man? - [ Barks ] Man, you're not happy. Now that's what I'm talkin' about. Hey, guys, meet my new friend. G'day, mates. I'm Dundee. I ran with the Australian agility team, Thunder From Down Under! Cool. We're the Rasta Rascals. You're gonna drive the little pups... and I'm gonna drive the rottweilers. Man, why I do always get the wussy dogs? Did he just call us ''wussies''? [ Hip-hop Continues ] - Excuse me. - Yeah?
