Well that's all l've got. l should kill you right now. Well what are you waitin' for? That's no way to start a friendship. Visitor. You don't look too good, Mr. Riggins. l'm Clive Connelly. l'm an attach? at the American Embassy in Gourna. l'm here to help you. Well, l've been here for almost a year now. The American government's a little reluctant to help an ex-Special Forces who gets himself... locked up for smuggling weapons. - You fucked up. - No shit. Mike, l hope you don't mind me callin' you Mike... 'cause l understand you got a problem with authority. You think you're special. Laws don't apply to you. Obviously you're wrong about that, pal. So get to your point. Well... you're a permanent resident of the worst fuckin' prison in the world. You owe a lot of money to a couple 'a very dangerous men. You stay in here much longer you're gonna be a dead man. You're a dead man on the outside, unless... Unless what? l got a proposition for you. One that could get you outta here... with a hundred thousand dollars in your pocket. We have a complex situation. One that's a little too politically delicate... for us to be directly involved in. An American citizen has been kidnapped. She's been held for the past eighteen months... at a compound near the Black Sea. By this man. Vlado Karadjov. Calls himself a warlord. So why didn't you go get her yourself? l guess diplomacy failed. The fuck wanted money. The American government doesn't pay ransoms. All right. l'll get you the girl, but, it's gonna cost you two hundred thousand. Fine. - When do l get my money? - Ten thousand now. The rest when you deliver the girl. Twenty now. l just happen... to have an extra ten grand. Now, my number is on speed dial on the cell phone. And this is a list of people that may be helpful to you. There could be one problem. The girl might resist. We think she's been drugged. What do you mean? One of our negotiators was allowed to talk to her. He got the impression that she... was developing sympathy for her kidnappers. Which isn't that uncommon when you've been kept for this long a period. We think the first guy you should visit is here. Zoran Posternoff. He runs a nightclub in the City Center named... Club Thirty-three. l know. Where's Zoran? Riggins. What the hell are you doing here? Business. Business? Sit down. Business? You owe me thirty thousand. l got ten right here. - And? - The rest, if you help me. - How? - l need to see Vlado Karadjov. Why? He's holding an American girl hostage. Take my advice. Karadjov has powerful allies. Nobody fucks with him and lives to tell about it. Nobody. - So where can l find him? - Okay. Wait here. l'm gonna see what l can do for you. Okay? Hi. You want a drink? You read my mind. l'll have raki. - Make it big. - Okay. You're American, you stay in Gourna? Well, that depends on you two. Here's to having a good time. You are coming with us. Hold him down. You still owe me ten. Remember, ten. Nice to see you haven't changed. Get him out of here. Move. What are you doing in my city? l'm here about a woman. What woman? Ana Gale. How much? What do you mean? Each time someone comes with a bigger offer. Only not big enough. How much this time? Nothin'. Nothing? Nothing. Her family wants her back. lf you come here again, l am not going to just shoot you. See, l don't like guns. You shoot people, and hospitals keep them alive. Okay. We're through. - What else you got? - What else? You got the Gloc G-two eighty-two that can open a hole inside of a tank, you know? Baretta ninety-two with ultra fire. Also, AK-forty-seven with extended rounds. Uh, titanium hull points. What else you can possibly need? How about some night-vision optics, some stun grenades. C-four. Are you going to fight a fucking army? And some remote bomb triggers. Whatever. Well, l got an appointment with Vlado Karadjov. - Are you crazy? - Apparently. Have you picked out your coffin yet? He lives in a military base. He's friends with General Drago. The Butcher of Sobrewsky, he make Milosevic look like a lump. Oh, l know. You don't have chance. Oh. Where is that base? Mama, Mama. Vlado. General Drago Don't be scared. Let's try that again. l'm here to rescue you. You're goin' home. You won't scream? Are you sure? Help. Help. Let go. Get in. Come on. Let me go. Hey, you gonna stop fighting, and get in the car? No. Okay. - Don't you dare. - Come on, you. Get in. Let me go. Let me out of here. Let me out of here. Let me go. You son of a bitch. Let me out of here. l could have been killed. You gonna try to run again? No. Who the hell do you think you are? Well, l'm here to get you away from the kidnappers. What kidnappers? Vlado Karadjov. l wasn't kidnapped. - You weren't? - No. You weren't drugged or somethin'? What? No. Well, why were you with Vlado then? Because l wanted to be. l work for a health organization. l came here two years ago after a meningitis outbreak. Once we got it under control... he made me an offer to take care of his hemophiliac son. Look. Somethin' isn't right here. What's not right is that you kidnapped me. My information says you were abducted. Well you'd better check your sources again... because l'm going to the police, - and l'm going to talk... - Look, park your tongue... for a second so l could think. All right. l'm gonna take you to the American Embassy in Luka. Why? Because they're payin' me to bring you back. Paying you? l was at the Embassy five months ago to extend my visa. All right, well, l can't go back without you, so... you're comin' with me. Get in the car. Hey. Stay quiet. Sit. Good morning, American Embassy. How may l direct your call? Mike Riggins for Mr. Clive Connelly. - Are you sure, sir? - Yeah, l'm sure. He's a, um, attach? for you guys. l'll check for you, sir. Please hold. - Hello, sir? - Hello? There's no one listed by that name. What, did you check all departments? Yes sir. No listing for Clive Connelly. No Clive Connelly? Nope. l'm sorry, sir. - Hello? - Mike. Clive Connelly. Yeah, l called the Embassy. You're no attach? or... Mike, let me explain. Explain what? Mike, Clive Connelly's not my real name. What are you talkin' about? lt's an alias l use. l told you this is a sensitive situation. This is bullshit. l spoke to this girl. She's...she was... she wasn't kidnapped. Mike. She's been brainwashed. She lives in a Army camp for God's sake. She's become sympathetic to her kidnappers. - l told you that. - What? Ask her her name. - Go ahead. Ask her her name. - What's your name? - My name? - Your name. What's your name? Ana Gale. Ana Gale. She's lying. Her real name's Ana Robbins. Well what does that prove? lt proves that in her state of mind she can't be trusted. Well, neither can you. How do l know who the hell you are? Come on, Mike. You think l could 'a got... you outta prison... without pulling political strings? What? What's he saying? l'll tell you what. Let's meet somewhere... and l'll prove to you everything l said is true. Mike, where are you now? - Somewhere close. - Okay. Now listen. There's a reservoir just outside of town. No, no. A public place. The Town Center Main Plaza in... thirty minutes. Okay. Bring the girl, all right? Just bring the money. - Prick. - What'd he say? He said your real name is Ana Robbins. That was my birth name. So why'd you lie about that? l took my mother's maiden name over a year ago, okay? l don't care anymore. l'm gonna see that guy, find out what the problem is. - And me? - You're gonna stay right here. Fine. What the hell? Get off me. - No. - Sorry. - Mike. - You got twenty seconds... to give me my money. - lt's not necessary. - And the snipers? What are you talking about? Call them off, you lyin' piece 'a shit. - They're there for our protection. - You got ten seconds. - Seven. Six. Five. - All units stand down. All units stand down. - Where's my money? - Where's my girl? Somewhere safe. You should have brought her with you, Mike. You must be fuckin' jokin'. Look, maybe we got off on the wrong foot. l should have been more forthcoming. - But the situation... - Has changed. l wanna know who the fuck you are and who sent you. l work for the U.S. government. lt's a special division of the C.l.A. That's why l was able to work the prison deal for you. Why? - We want the girl. - But she wasn't kidnapped. Yes, l know that. Well, who is she? That's none 'a your business. Well, l wanna see my money now. Mike, l'm prepared to offer you substantially more money... if you just give the girl to me now. Well, that sounds like a real good offer. l think l have a better one. How about fuck you? What the fuck is wrong with you, huh? Drago wants you dead, Vlado wants you dead. You have nowhere to go. Maybe if l bring her back, they'll pay me. Sit down, Mike. - Sit down. - You wanna kill me, go ahead. You'll never find her. Move it, hurry. Now. Stay on him. He's on a black bike. A black bike. Keep an eye out for the girl. Connelly, we're approaching the. That jackass. Where the hell does he think he's goin'? Drago. He's headed right towards you. ...at the Square Do not lose that son of a bitch, do not lose him. ...innocent. Mr. Robbins? Clive Connelly on the phone for you. About time. - What do you have for me? - l'm still workin' on it. What do you mean you're workin' on it? l hear Ana's not with Vlado anymore. - Yeah, that's right. - So, what's the problem? There's no problem. Don't worry about it. l've got it under control. No, Clive, you don't. Because if you did, we would have Ana right now. What if this guy goes AWOL and... decides to cross the border with her? General Drago, who controls the border, is on our payroll. Riggins won't get across it. lt won't happen. Well, that better be the fucking case, Clive. l've got a lot on the line here. See what you can find out about this Riggins guy. Right away, sir. All right. We're gettin' out. Damn it. Drago, we need to talk. When l find that fuckin' American... l'm gonna kill him. Not likely. Riggins is very, very well trained. General, the guy walked into your camp... blew the place to shit, and walked out with the girl. Excuse me. What are you saying, l'm incompetent? No, l'm saying you don't understand... who the fuck you're dealing with. The American l'll kill for free. What do you propose for the girl? lt's a hundred thousand dollars in cash. You can do whatever the fuck you want with Riggins. But l get the girl. Volker just may have a problem with that. Fuck Vlado. Because of him all this happened. He brought the girl to your camp without considering the consequences. General, you work for me. You do what l need to have done... and there's another four hundred thousand dollars for you. Deal. They're at a train station. Let's go. How do l get to Clogdale? The Ested departs in twenty minutes. Where do you think you're goin'? Let go of me. l'm callin' for help. No you're not. l don't care what's goin' on... but l'm not fuckin' around anymore. Okay. Let's go. - How did you find me? - The bellboy. Just get on. So how come everyone's lookin' for you? l have no idea. l don't. There's somethin' you're not tellin' me. Look, why don't you ask your employer why he really sent you. He already told me. And you believe that? Great. Get down. Look. Come on. Come on. Come on. Do not shoot the girl. Come on. The American, where did he go? Where is he? There they go, this way, let's go. Come on. Get in the back. Get down. - Hang on. - No. No, please, l'm stuck. You all right? Okay. Where are we going? Sit down. Two coffees, please. were ex last seen in a vehicle with license plate...

Ana Robbins is the daughter of billionaire tycoon, Alister Robbins... an oil and shipping magnet, who passed away last week... due to heart complications. Ana has been missing for more than a year. Six months ago, her father offered a two million dollar reward... for her safe return. You're Alister Robbin's daughter? Well, that explains a few things, don't you think? Look, l'm sorry. - For what? - Well, for your father. - Forget it. l despise him. - Why? Well, because he had an affair with... my mother and got her pregnant. But he never wanted to marry her. She loved him and she drank herself to death. l hated him. l disowned him for that. Well it's a lotta money to give up. l don't care about that. l never saw him again. - Well, look, Ana. - Excuse me. And, uh, l- l'd like to... Um...Oh- okay, l'm gonna have to call you back. Out. Mike. Get in. - They're everywhere. - Yeah, it's gonna get worse. - How much? - How much what? To take me in.

You have caused me much trouble. - l'm sorry to hear that. - Help us Vlado, please. - They're trying to kill us. - Okay. l will take you to the American Embassy in Luka. l'll take care of her. l always have. Well, l'm still comin' with you. l have some unfinished business. Vlado. Well, why am l not surprised? Time to show you the money, Mike. l assume we still have a deal. Not that you have much choice at this point. Pick it up and walk away. - What about Ana? - l'll take care of her. l promise. Take the car. - Vlado wont need it. - Mike. What are you doing? Everything'll be fine. So it really was all about the money? Bastard. Don't worry. Well, Princess. What do you want? Your father was either a sentimental old fool... or he felt guilty about... fucking your mother and not marrying her. What are you talking about? He left the controlling interest of Robbin lndustries to you. You must be kidding. l have no interest in his dirty business. That's good. Then you won't have any trouble signing this. lt's a pre-notarized transfer deed... of your controlling interest in Robbin lndustries. So all's it needs is your signature. Transfer to who? - Your uncle, Trent Robbins. - Uncle Trent? He's behind all this? He's your father's brother. Somebody has to run the business, right? No, this is all wrong. He can't do this. What do you care? - Just sign the fuckin' paper. - No, you'll kill me anyway. You stupid bitch. Sign the document. No. You are either going to sign this document... or l'm gonna have little pieces of your brain all over it. Do you understand me? Where the fuck did he come from? He saved us. l'm sorry. He was a good man. Drago, he's heading out of town in your direction. - Cut him off. - Copy that. One down. Watch out. There they are. Keep on 'em. Hang on. Cut them off. Get on 'em. They're getting close. Stay with them. Shit. Watch out. There they are. Keep on 'em. Right there. Shoot, now, now. How the hell are they finding us? Connelly. Where the hell are they? Goddamn it, we lost 'em. We gotta return to base now. Oh. Shit. Well, l guess that's it. Well, let's go. Come on. Well, l guess these are the best accommodations in the area. As long as there's no bed for you to tie me to. There you go. That'll have to do. Thank you for coming back for me. Why'd you do it? Beats the hell outta me. How did you end up here of all places? The Marine Corps. Brought me to the Balkans. l was in Kosovo. All the way up till it ended. Saw things in that war no one should have to see. So l came here. To do what? Transporter of high tech stuff. You mean a weapons smuggler? Not exactly. l was bringing weapons out of war zones. Maybe it was my way of justifying what l was doing. And you got caught? Yeah. And now you're just a kidnapper, huh? l was. Are we gonna make it? l don't know. lt doesn't look too good. Every road from here to Luka's has been sealed. lsn't there some other place we can run to? You don't run from a guy like Connelly. You'll just make it easier for him to put a bullet in your back. Let's get some rest. You get some sleep, l'll take the first watch. At least l'll die rich. - What are you doin' up? - l couldn't sleep. How's your wound? Where is he? He's gone under for now, but he can surface any minute. This is the most insane fuckin' thing l've seen. Where's Drago now? l've got every one of his men on it, still nothing. This guy has more brains and guts than all of you put together. lf you had paid Drago the money he wanted for the girl to start... with none 'a this would have happened. From now on, do not do anything, l mean, anything without checking with me first. Got it? Hey. Wow. What happened last night? The best thing to happen to me in a long time. l don't care who you are. l'm just damn glad l met you. We need to find some transportation. Well, let's hit the road. Hang on. Police are tellin' me a truck was stolen... from a farm twenty kilometers from here... - by a man and a woman. - Just got a call. The Board'll give me full control of the shares... within thirty days if Ana can't be found. Kill 'em both. Three miles to the Embassy. They know we only have one place to go. Relax. Yes sir. Here we go. Buckle up. Oh, shit. Take the wheel. Good. Sir, we got an unidentified vehicle inbound at a high rate of speed. Terrorist attack. Take your positions. Fire. - What are they doing? - They think we're terrorists. Stay down. Get down. Let's go. Come on. All right. Get down over there. Ana. Come on out, okay, kitten. - Uncle Trent. - Stay down. Fire. l'm not gonna ask you again. Come out, Ana. Fuck me. Ana. - Take the second floor. - No problem. Ana. Ana. Where are you? Ana. Uncle Trent. You bastard. Come on, kitten.

All right boys. Stand down. So, now that you're a rich woman... what are your plans? l thought l'd kidnap you for a change. But this time we'll do it right. Oh.
