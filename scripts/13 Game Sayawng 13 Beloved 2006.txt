The rest is up to you. Ok Professor, this is my friend, Chit. Chit, this is Professor Winai. Afternoon sir. He wants to talk about the brass instruments we're thinking about buying. Oh yes, come on in. Thank you. Let's take a look Well... I heard a student playing on the trumpet... and the sound quality wasn't that clear. I would like to recommend this one. You're from Yamaha? Yes, sir. Chang? I talked to Prame yesterday. Oh really? I thought you were from a different company, not Yamaha, as well. I can't help you. I'm about to place an order with Prame. Hi Mom. Hi Chit. Have you eaten yet? Yes, mom. Good. So what are you doing? I'm on my way home. I'm almost there. When you get there, try to rest, ok? Yes, mom. There's no need to worry. Are you coming home for the Songkran holidays? Everyone is asking about you. I don't know if I can clear my work in time... ...I might need to do overtime. Everyone is very busy this time of year. Promotions are coming up. I might have the chance to become a supervisor... Isn't that good? Oh? That would be great. But I'm sure I can come home for a couple of days. That's good, son. If work is getting tough then come home and relax. It worries me seeing you work so hard. If Bangkok is too hectic then come home. Yes, Mom. We may not be wealthy... but we'll be close. We can take care of each other. Yes mom. But don't worry. Everything is coming along fine. That's wonderful son... And... Maew... how is she doing? If you're coming home, bring her along. She's a famous singer now. Has she's forgoten me? Please tell her that we all miss her. I will, mom. Sign here, please. What's this? You've missed over 3 months of payments. Didn't you read the notices we sent? Sign here, too. Thank you. I'll need your keys too. Hey, come stand here. Don't get stuck in the middle. Why are you taking the bus? Need a change in scenery? Umm... No. Hey, I brought your CD. But why? Don't you like the songs? Don't you want the CD? No, it's not like that... You won't have to make another copy to give to a studio. It'll save you some cash. I gave up that idea a long time ago. Go ahead, keep it. What record company would want these? I think your music is much better than a lot of stuff nowadays. You're just saying that. Seriously. Why don't you give yourself a chance? Honestly, this internship is killing me. They use me like a full employee. So? Quit. Get the hell out. Are you crazy? My dad would kill me. You don't graduate in computers... ...to become a musician. Oh, so you want like this then? When is Somboon taking us for our bonus dinner? I have no idea. Is Somboon choosing the restaurant? Why doesn't he let Prame do it? The person with the best sales record should choose. Exactly... If it wasn't for Prame's sales, we wouldn't even be getting a bonus. Yeah, that's true. Phuchit, is something bothering you? Ohh... oh... nothing. Ok then, I'd better get to work Ok Hey, Prame? Oh, Chit. What's up? Did you make a sale over at St. Nicholas? Yes. Is something wrong? That school was one of my clients and you knew it. Who is your contact? A friend. He's a teacher there. We've been talking about it for ages. Why did you... Chit... You were too slow. Chit, Somboon wants to see you right away. It's Ok, Am. Have a seat. Your documnents... I don't understand... why your sales have been dropping for the past 3 months... whereas everyone else seems to be doing better. I'm trying, sir. Trying? Is this what you call trying? I think you misunderstand the meaning of "trying". Take Prame, for example. That's called trying. Excuse me, Mr. Somboon. The system is setup now. I need to try to and access it from outside. Do you know what's happening next month? We're using our computer network? That's right. We're going online. There are many benefits to this system. It will let us work more efficiently and effectively. Most importantly it will lower our overheads, particularly those that don't generate profit. I really don't want to do this to you... This resignation letter will give you the opportunity to apply elsewhere without getting a bad reference from us. Thank you, Tong. Sorry. Hello mom. Chit. What is it mom? Do you have 8000 Baht I could borrow? Fai needs it for her school registration. But I just sent you some money, mom. She used it to buy a new phone. If she fails to register today, she will not be able to study this year. Ok, mom. I'll transfer the money. Thank you, son. I wont ask for anymore. I'm so sorry. As soon as your dad returns, I'll pay you back It's alright, mom. I still have some savings. I'll transfer it to you. If there isn't anything else, I'd better get back to work Bye, mom. Hello? Hello?

Good job. You did it much better than we expected. You broke the record for having the most viewers. People are watching? Of course. This is a game show. How could we not have an audience? I thought you said... Forget about that... Let's talk about your prize instead. Currently, you have 800,000 Baht in your account. You can check your balance with this phone... just as you did with your other phone. For the next challenge, you must walk for 3 bus stops. The video clearly identifies the suspect as... Mr. Phuchit Puengnathong. An employee of Sahamongkol Music... who earlier injured one of his co-workers... as well as a street beggar in the market. This was most likely triggered... from high levels of stress... after being laid off from work In addition to financial debts... which, caused him to go on a rampage. For this case... Pol. Col. Surachai Tantiweerakun, the head of the investigation division, a special division of our national police force, has personally taken over the manhunt... and is currently with us for an interview. Hello sir... Hello. Why have you taken a special interest in this case? In the past... we've dealt with people under similar circumstances. Though this sounds like a trivial case, in the interest of public safety, the situation must be supressed before it escalates. Do you feel that his condition... was triggered purely by stress... or were other factors involved? According to evidence and witness testimony, the suspect appears to be coherant. So, I am positive other factors are involved. Can you elaborate more? Not at this moment, because we're still in the middle of a ongoing investgation. Is anyone there? This is the condition of the house before Chew started neglecting it... after his wife passed away 4 years ago. Chew has refused to move out... so his family to abandon him. He gave this reason when asked why he wouldn't move. "I don't want to move." "I built this house with my own hands." "I built it for them but they don't want to live here." "And on top of that, they wanted to tear it down." Chew built this house in 1955. He continued to add extensions to the house, but the most unique feature of the house is its indoor wishing well, which he never let anyone cover... for it would unbalance the house's sense of Feng Shui. "Just let it be." "Any house with a filled in well is damned. Didn't you know that?" Chew struggles with paralysis and other minor illnesses... which are burdens to his everyday life. "I'd like a wheelchair." "And I want them to come and check up on me once in awhile." Even though life in the capital city will continue to improve, there will always be cases of the elderly being neglected. We don't feel that this incident is unique to Chew, but we tell his story hoping that people will take better care of their elders, and not leave them in solitude. This is the condition of the house before Chew started neglecting it... What the hell? You saw the TV, didn't you? Yes. I'm going to give you an opportunity to do a good deed for a change. A chance to help someone. That person is Chew. He's still inside this house. What do I have to do? Do you remember the well? Yes. I'm looking for it right now. Excellent. Chew is in the well. You have 10 minutes to help him out. How long has Chew been in there? A little over 10 days. And you knew he'd fallen in 10 days ago? Why didn't you help him? It's not our business. It's the responsibility of his relatives to care for him, isn't it? I guess, but... If you hurry he might still be alive. You have 10 minutes starting from when you hang up the phone. Help Chew from the well... and get the telephone number from his shirt pocket... then call his relatives to come pick him up. If you succeed, a cash prize of 1.2 million Baht will be yours. Do you understand? Ok If you understand, then start. Stop creeping me out! I'm trying to help you. Then your relatives can have a proper funeral for you, and then you can rest in peace. Helloo... Who do you wish to speak to? Hello, Are you a relative of Chew's? Nope. I'm just his nephew. Chew's fallen down the well. He's dead. Come and pick up his body. What was that? Chew's fallen down the well. He's dead. Who's going to a water fall? Who was that? Muay, answer it! I can't... I doing my nails? You get it! I'm playing a game. Can't you see? Well, can't you see what I'm doing? Aren't you a little too young to be doing that? Hurry up and get the phone, will you? You hurry up! Forget it! What's wrong with you two? Can't you hear the phone? Well, it's her... God it's annoying. He won't pick it up. Stop arguing, will you? I don't you what your problems are. What is so hard about answering the damn phone? You're useless, both of you! Hello, you've reached the Chotisetianpaisarn residence. Are you a relitive of Chew's? Not really... I'm just his son. Your father fell down the well. What did you say? I can't hear you. Your dad drowned in the well. Please come and get his body. Who? What? Who died? Your god damn father drowned in the freaking well! No, your father died, asshole! Dad... the well... Dead! Oh My God! Dad! Mommy! How the hell did you get in here? I Heard about it on TV, so I stopped by. Are you a burglar? How dare you say that!? I'm here to help. What kind of a family are you? Didn't give a damn about your dad... you left him to drown. You've got some nerve! The coroner's almost here... and the police are on their way. Hey, where the hell do you think you're going? Stay and talk to the cops first, Mister nice guy. Mister nice guy? Do you have any cigarettes? Tong, you're working over time? Don't work so hard. Maew... Maew... Maew... Oh... Chit. Why are you walking away? I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you. How are you? I'm sorry, but I need to get going. Maew... my mom says she misses you. She wants both of us to visit her during the holidays. Phuchit... We've been through this. We're finished. We can start over. Maew. I've changed. I can buy a house now. I can even buy you a car. I can give you everything you've ever wanted. Chit... stop it. I've heard this all before. I've wasted enough time on you. You should go home if you're drunk I'm not drunk I'm telling the truth. If you don't believe me, then take a look at my bank balance. Chit, even if you had... all the money in the world... you still couldn't make me famous. Maew... Maew... I've been looking everywhere for you. I'm so sorry. Leave me alone. That hurts. This is Phuchit, an acquaintance. Phuhit, this is Chalerm, my boyfriend. Maew, I'm sorry. I won't do this to you again. Chalerm! Come on? That hurts. I'm sorry. Please come back to me. You always say that, but I've had enough. I'll do anything. Forgive me, I beg you? Hello. Now it's time to engage your brain a little. You'll need a partner for the next challenge. Do you remember the number of this challenge? Of course! Good. Then just look for something in the area... that has the number 8 associated with it. Then what? Then look around for someone with a number 8. Once you have found that number 8... on that particular person You must take the object with our number 8 and knock them out with it. Why didn't you just tell me that in the first place? I'll be more than glad to whack him with this chair. Why didn't you just say that? Well, that's how the script was written. Chalerm... Chalerm... Stop! Phuchit, what are you doing? Maew... Chalerm... That's it. Maew, let me expla... Why the hell do you keep getting up? I'm tired... Maew... let me explain. Chalerm! Chalerm! Chalerm! Honey, don't die. Please get up. Chalerm... Chalerm... Wake up! Please! Somebody please help us! Chalerm, please don't die, OK? What are you going to do to him? Chalerm... Chalerm... Please take this man to the hospital. I don't think so... he'll stain my seats. Forget it... he'll get blood all over my car. Get the hell out, then! Maew, get him in the car. How could you do this? Help! This asshole is hi-jacking my car. Anybody! Help! He's taking my car. The office is closing. The office is closing. It's an orange taxi. And what about the assailant? He's a guy dressed like an office worker, his clothes are filthy and he's wearing glasses. Ok, we are coordinating activities with Pol. Col. Surachai Tantiwiirakul, who is overseeing this case. It's believed that this case... is related to an incident that happened at 11 am this morning. Chalerm... you'll be ok You asshole, why did you do that? What if he dies? What will you do then? Maew, show me some respect. Why? Do you think you're some kind of saint? Look what he did to you! Am I supposed to ignore that he beats you? I'm may be an asshole, but did I ever beat you like he did? Please help him. Chalerm, Chalerm At this time we have new developments... in a case which is hitting the headlines. Police are currently on the look out for... Mr. Phuchit Puengnathong, a member of staff at Sahamongkol Music. Why are you doing this? Congratulations. You've made it to level 9.

And you're about to add another 50 million in level 12! So, you're sure that... Mr. Chit was involved in the clothesline incident? Yes. And what were you doing at the scene? I went to where the website told me to go. Website? Website? How can I put this? The website was just a blank page. I typed in the address just as you did. Then I googled Chit's name and everything, but there's no such thing. They must have moved the site. Yes, sir. The injured man at the scene has died. That leaves you as the only witness to testify that Phuchit was there. There was an old woman. She... The report doesn't mention anyone else. Is there anything else? In that case, I'll be on my way. He's always accusing me. He has something against me. Tell the truth, now, old man! How do you know it was me? Because the damn thing didn't come from my village. This filth is from your village. I know you don't like me... ...but you've got no right saying that. Dom has had the damn thing since the WWII, but who would do such a thing? What's going on? The folks from Daeng's village. They took a samurai sword and slaughtered my cow. If that weren't enough, they cut out her guts. Damn psychos! Yes, that's what they are. And where is your home? Sorry if the boys were a little rough with you. Please don't be angry at me... Tong. You were the one who learned of us first, so we naturally had to learn about you. And before I go any further, we must thank you... ...for revealing a weak point. What's all that? As far as you know, it's an online game-a paid online reality game You must pay like everyone else if you wish to join. Don't just hack in! You created this all on your own? That's right. But this is only one of many games. What do you mean? If you want to know, just keep watching. Who's that? This has gone too far. Do you know how many people this game has hurt? Of course. Then why do you do it? Don't lose your cool. It's just a game to all those who can win. How can you screw with people's lives? It's not me. Those who play this game make their own choices. That is against the law. The law? Don't worry. We own the law. No! Stop this right now... I told you already. I can't. Now, I'm just a single component of the game. What are you doing? I had to put him to sleep. He had rabies. Do you want to kill me? What are you doing to him? He wants to kill me Why do we bother to keep him around? Why did you want to hurt your dad like that? He beats you, mom. He beats me. I want to kill him. Don't think like that. Why not? He's never given you anything. Why are you protecting him? He's given me plenty, son. Like what? He gave me you. It would destroy me if you turned bad. Don't disappoint me, please. To see you grow into a responsible adult... would be the greatest thing in my life. I can't do it. I give up. Dad? He didn't lose. It's you who lost. Don't think too much of it. The world of reality is behind me. Take a look! People today hide behind morality... It's just a big mask That's far scarier than anything you've witnessed here. Because we never know when they'll drop their masks. Maybe if it were you... you might had done a betterjob than Chit. You bastard! Mr. Kie... Let go of me! You asshole! You little shit! You bastard! Murderer! I didn't kill him. We did it together. Let me go! Team Buadaeng and Ric Mortimer
