It's just a water gun, you jerk. This is Mad Dog. I can't wait for backup. I'm going in alone. You're dead meat, Mad Dog. You feel lucky about yourself, Sanchez? Do you, punk? - [Sanchez] Eat slime, cop. - You're mine. Sanchez, come out with your hands in the air. - What are you doing? - Oh, no, I thought you were on fire. We're not finished, Mr. Butler. You're lucky I got a class. Damn civilians. - [Sighs] - [Door Creaking] Okay, we'll do it the hard way. Freeze, dirt bag! - Get out of here. - I'm history. Nice of you to drop in, Butt-ler. Well, I'm dropping out. If you hurt me, my dad will rip your head off. Blood and guts and slime will be coming out your ears. That don't scare Rio. My dad's doin' hard time. You must be very proud. - I am. - Whoa. A dollar a day. That's a bargain to come to this school. - Ain't it? - You smell like vomit. Butler thinks he's a real cop. Put me down! Crawl back in the hole you came from! Two bucks. Thanks for the money, dweeb. - Give it back to me, you pus heads. - Pus heads? - Pus heads? - That calls for payback. - Put me down! Put me down! Guys, please. - You little twerp! - Please. - I meant it in the nicest way. - Too bad! - Too bad! - [Toilet Flushing] - Ohh! Swirly. Looks like you had a little accident. - Hope you have fun. - Enjoy your recess, nerd! - Let me in! Let me in! - I love this school. I've been looking for you, mister. You been swimmin', Butler? No, he's been dunkin' for turds. [Children Laughing] [Teacher] That's enough! Let's you and I take a walk. - Give my regards to Mr. Flemming. - [Children] Yeah! Now tell me, what have you learned today? Sit up straight. That I can hold my breath a lot longer than I thought I could. Do I sense, uh... a little insolence? No. Devon. Devon, Devon, Devon. Lies are not explanations. I'm not lying. Every day these big jumbos... come and take my money, they put me in the toilet... and hold me upside down. Always blaming it on someone else. You leave me no choice, Devon. I have to call your grandmother. Mister Flemming, please. You don't have to call her. She can't take personal calls. It makes her sick. And she's on a very hard shift now. Sit down, Devon. Devon, if I don't make this call, you will never learn... and I would have done you a great injustice. - 2-8-3, isn't it? - Yeah. - What? - Yes, Mr. Flemming. Thank you. Ah, don't worry about Flemming. He's just a dork. Yeah? Well, why doesn't my grandmother know that? - [Sirens Wailing] - Stop, listen. - Fire truck? - No, that's a cop. It's code three. Let's roll. [Truck Honking] [Speaker] I'm not getting out of this car. I hate to run! [Driver] I told you I'm not getting out of this car! What are you, a nut? Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh! [Driver] I warned you. - Do all cops do that? - Only the best. [Driver] Quintero, who do you think is gonna run out of gas first? [Waldo] Chu, get in! - [Devon] Here, hold these. - Got 'em. - Did you get the license? - You bet. [Driver] Quintero, don't jump over that fence. I hate to run. Look, we gotta go see that. Son of a... Son of a... I hate to jump. I really hate to jump. Come on, Sanchez, keep up. We're gonna win first prize this year. Oh, my goodness! Who do you think you are, the Lone Ranger? Get out of my yard! [Driver] End of the line! Hey, get your filthy butt off my car. I just had it waxed. All right, we're gonna do it the hard way. Aaah! All right, stop whining. You drop something, Quintero? Looks like drugs. That ain't mine. You know who I am? You used to be Nick McKenna before you lost a step. Oww! Oh, I'm sorry. I broke the nose. And I gotta fix it. I'm s... Let me fix this. I think I can fix it. - Ooh. - Aaah! Gentle. I should've been a doctor. It's all right. Sorry about the disturbance. All right, put your hands out. You know the drill. Now I'm gonna tie you to the car, 'cause I don't want you gettin' in my car, all right? Yeah. You know why? Because you stink like garbage. Okay, you ready? And we'll just take this little evidence along. [Engine Starting] You overweight rat. You're a sore loser. Hey, McKenna, come on, man. Listen, this is not civilized. He's makin' that fool run all the way back to the station. Damn you, McKenna. You're not gonna do this. Not the freeway! Let's get out of here. - Good-bye. - See you later. You're late. Freeze! Devon? Grandma, you won't believe what me and Ray saw. "What Ray and I saw." The school called again, Devon. What'd the school say? Devon, you gotta stop playin' stupid cop games. - They're not stupid. - And just start taking responsibility. But if I were a policeman, I probably could take care of you... and get my own apartment someday. I'll take care of myself. You just learn to take care of yourself. Honey, did you see my keys? - You're going to work? - Yes, yes, I'm going to work. The keys are in the ashtray, next to my handcuffs. The hospital's shorthanded. I gotta sub again. But tonight's the night we watch Miami Vice together. Don't you think I wish I could just sit back and watch TV with you? But you're a nurse. You could make up some great disease. Oh, you know I can't do that. [Car Honking] There's my ride. In bed by 9:00. - But Grandma, wait! - And not a minute later! - Do you hear me, Devon? - I can't do that. 10:30. Forget it. 9:45. I'm in the fourth grade. 9:30. And you're in the third grade. Deal. You have your police whistle? Yes, Devon, I have it. Now, Mrs. Norris across the hall is gonna to look in on you. Make sure you leave your homework out so I can check it. Okay. Leaving him alone again, I see. Stickin' your sweet face into everybody's business again, I see. Bye. Your grandmother should be reported to social services. Oh, really? And you should be reported to the Orkin Man. [Speaking Spanish] You're under arrest. My client's ready to make a deal. What're you offering? First degree reduced to second... with a guarantee of no more than ten years. Make it five. Seven, but I'll want him to testify against Medford. That's bonus information. Ever hear of "quid pro quo"? Quid pro quo. One hand washes the other? Why don't you get me some soap? [Indistinct Chatter] Hey, Ray, wanna go for a ride? Sorry, I have to eat dinner with my parents. Call you later. Okay. [Devon] That black car again! [Barge Horn Blowing] Hey, Quintero, McKenna gave you the third degree, huh? He tried to ask me about Bobo and the drugs being delivered to Mr. Fountain. I told him Zippo. You did good. Good enough to even meet the boss, you stiff. He's gonna thank you personally, I want you to know that. What do you think? Sit, sit, sit. [Quintero] I'm just bein' a stand-up guy. [Fountain] Well, hey I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around I'm never in one place, hey I roam from town to town I love 'em and I leave 'em 'Cause you know that I'm the best I hop into my car and I drive around the world - They call me the wanderer - The wanderer - Yeah, the wanderer - Whoa, whoa, whoa I roam around and 'round and 'round and 'round Around and 'round and 'round and 'round Hey, boss, you kill me. You are my idol, Mr. Fountain, my idol. I'm so happy to meet you. I love your singing. Do you have an album out? You wouldn't be just saying that to butter me up, would you? Because I detest hypocrisy. No way. Ooh, Chu, there's a fish in here. Get rid of it. - [Chu] You got it, boss. - Hey, what're you doin'? - Hey, turn loose of me. - You know, in a fit of nostalgia, I was gonna shoot you myself, but I hate being so hands-on, but I hate stoolies even more. Stoolie! I'm no stoolie. I never said a word to McKenna. Are you kidding me? You really think that I don't know why they let you go so fast? [Quintero] You got it all wrong. [Muffled] Hey! What a waste of a good chicken leg. Heh, heh, heh. Relax. You're gonna get indigestion. You're gonna love this. It's gonna take you all the way back to 1961. Splish splash I was takin' a bath All about a Saturday night - Bum, bum, bum - Bum, bum, bum Rub-a-dub I jumped back in the tub Bobo delivers the euphoria 10:30 Thursday morning. That's 100 grand. Your cop friends get that, Quintero, huh? Was it loud enough for you, huh? - [Muffled Yelling] - [Fountain] What, you can't swim? Hey, Quintero, I hope you got your flippers on. I hope your suit is drip-dry. [Splash] [Clank] Relax. Probably the pigeons. I'll take care of it. - Oh, no. - I'm comin', boss. We'll take care of this, Mr. Fountain. You really think that's gonna work? No, boss. I'm stupid. Just once I would like to conduct business in a hygienic environment. - Yes, boss. - Yes, boss. [Reporter] Come on, McKenna, you've gotta give me something. I haven't got anything. I just got here, for cryin' out loud. - Give me a break, will ya? - Hey, found him for you. - Quintero? - So much for the "scum floats" theory. He was my only lead. Hey, relax. Got a witness. - You got a witness? - Yes, sir. - Where is he? - Well, he's right over here. Where? - Nick. - Yeah? Over here. He's been askin' for you all night. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Devon Butler. You can just call me Devon. Ready for fingerprinting? Let me talk to you a minute. Have you got any idea what a sharp lawyer... will do with a little kid on the witness stand? He will rip this little guy to shreds. He won't know the killer from Captain Kangaroo. - What are you trying to do to me? - Nick, he's all we got. What's up? Little boy, if you saw the bad man again, would you recognize him? Don't you think a formal interrogation downtown is in order? And Captain Kangaroo hasn't been on the air for nine years. God hates me. Get his parents, get him downtown. [Nick] Who are you? I'm Devon Butler. I just told you back there. Short memory. Ha, ha. Look at that fat jumbo. Do you recognize anybody in the book? You have any pictures of these guys from the back? I don't think I like that question. Why? That's the way I saw 'em. Let me explain something to you, all right? See, my strong suit is not patience. So what I want you to do is look at the book there and find someone you recognize. Otherwise I'm going to rip your little head off. Nick. I got a plate number. Son, why didn't you tell us that before? Anybody ever heard of quid pro quo? One hand washes the other. One hand washes the other. That's bonus information. Would you like a Popsicle? No, I don't want no Popsicle. I want to see your superior. Hello, Devon. My name is Captain Rubio. I understand from Detective McKenna that you wanted to see me. You need me to testify and identify, right? Yes, Devon, that would be very helpful. Ma'am, I'd like to cut a deal. [Rubio] He wants to be a cop. What? Shield, assignments, squad car, the works. And he's not gonna help us unless he gets it. Bring the criminal back when you arrest him. Don't go... Don't go let him eat. Just bring him to jail. Bring him to jail! Oh. Give me five minutes with him alone. Hey, uh... So, anybody want a sip? Guess not. [Devon Humming] Devon, sweetie, why don't you just go ahead and give us that plate number... and then we can all go home. Okay, make me a cop. Why do you want to be a cop? Look at this guy. Raggedy-ass clothes, 20-year-old car, bad back, bad marriage, bad attitude. Son, does that sound like any kind of life for anybody? But if you were a cop, people don't sass you. Give us the plate number! Nick! I'll give you a little taste of what I got. A taste? Where does he get this stuff? Prime time. There's a shipment of euphoria coming in. Tell us something we don't know. Thursday, 10:30. Mm-hmm. Where? Don't know, but I got a name. Why is everyone gatherin' around me? What's the name? - I really want to give you his name. - Mm-hmm. You put me on duty, it's yours. Hey, McPhail, I'm from outer space. Listen, you've had ride-alongs before. No, I don't. Yes, you have, so I want you to take him for eight hours. - Other guys have ride-alongs. - Put a sock in it, Nick! I want you to drive him around for eight hours, let him hit the siren a couple of times, humor him. What is the problem with this? - I don't get along with kids. - I don't care. - I don't like them, they don't like me. - Nobody cares. You can't have any fun with a kid. You take a kid to a bar, he has one drink, he falls off his stool. What? You gave me such a wonderful present today. You gave me two destroyed lawns, a Weber grill, a chaise lounge... - I gave you a perp. - Reckless endangerment. You owe me. I don't owe you nothin'! I don't owe you nothin'! You owe me this thing, Nick! Nick, when you get home, you want to check and see how the blues fit? - Are they a little snug under the belt? - [Slams Table] - Hello, I'm detective... - Baby! Oh, baby. I told them not to call. Oh, you had me scared to death! Mrs. Baldwin, hi. I'm Captain Rubio. Yes, yes. As I explained, young Devon here witnessed a murder earlier this evening. - Fortunately, he wasn't harmed. - They're gonna let me be a cop. What Devon means is: We're just gonna have one of our men... ride him around for a few hours, sort of as a reward. It's quid pro quo for helping them out. My grandson has seen all I want him to see of police work. No, no, no. This is going to be nothing dangerous. He's going to be riding with our department's most decorated man. Devon, you ride around with me for eight hours. If you so much as think about getting in my way, I'm gonna tie your little ass to the axle and drag you all over the city. - Okay? Hmm? - [Rubio] Nick. I'd like you to meet Devon's grandmother. How do you do? No, no, please don't bother with introductions. We're leaving. You talk to my grandson again like that and you'll be wearing that axle. Grandma, I'll be serving our community, taking responsibility. Now where'd you get that? - From you. - Well... - Thank you! - Now, I didn't say yes. But you said "well," and you always say "well" before you say "yes." Well, look, we need to discuss this some more. That's, uh, sharp, Nick. [Fountain] Remember when I first met you Wish me luck. The heavens in my heart - Leaped into your eye... - [Knocking] You're amazing. You really think so, huh? This better be good. [Chu] Well, sir, they got a witness. And what did this witness witness? It's just some kid, but we know where he lives. How much could a little kid see? I was a little kid once myself and I saw everything. Thank you. Chu, find out everything you can about this kid. [Devon] Nice pair of boots, Nick. I have to get me a pair of those. So what kind of hardware do you carry? I carry a bazooka in the trunk. Everyone, could I please get your attention? You be careful out there. Don't talk to anybody, especially me. Hey, kid, you take care of McKenna. He's fading fast. I'm an eight-year-old, not a miracle worker. Get in the car. My shield, my badge. All right, here you are. Now get in the car. I always wanted one of these. Get in the car! Yes? My cuffs. A cop's gotta have cuffs. He's right, McKenna. Cuffs are what make this job worth doing. Thank you. Everybody, get in the car! - Javohl. - Aye, aye. Let's get down to business. We're gonna have fun. Right. - Buckle up. - Wait a minute, I can't see. Raise your butt up. All right. [Speaker] Calling all cars, all cars. This is Detective Butler. - What are you doing? - You give me no joy. [Devon] What do you got under the hood? [McKenna] I got an engine and in a minute, you. Hey, when do we stop for donuts and coffee? Haven't you heard about secondary smoke? [Coughing] Haven't you heard about minding your own business? At this very moment, the pink, delicate tissues... of my still-forming lungs may be shriveling... into green chunks of mucus... struggling for their last gasp of poison, brown air. - Happy? - Now you're littering. What are we here for? Stakeout. It's your shift. Do I look like a five-year-old to you? I can't tell. The light's not too good in here. Deal's off. This is Dullsville. Well, lesson number one: Police work is Dullsville. - What'd you have in mind? - Cop stuff. Shakedowns, shootouts, busting scumbags. All right. Look, partner. A code 27. Purse snatch. Hey, come here! Hey! Kid! [Devon] Stop, thief! - [Honking] - Hey, watch where you're driving! I'm commandeering your vehicle. Hey, get back here! What are you, nuts? Whoa! Whoo! Dammit! [Devon] Police business. Coming through. Look out! Sorry. Aah! Aah... [Devon] Stop! I hate to run! - Make it easy on yourself. - Martha! Martha! - Stop, thief! - Martha! Martha! - Bye, honey. Have a nice day. - Thanks, honey. What are you doing! You're under arrest for violating code 27. Boy, Nick, you don't look too great. I nabbed the purse snatcher. My wife forgot her purse. I was trying to catch her before she got on the bus! - You're not a purse snatcher? - No. I'm calling the cops. I am a police officer. Great. What are you gonna do about this? This? I'm gonna kill this. Why do you think I spend hours and hours at the range... shooting at silhouettes, shooting the hearts right out of 'em? Every single day. I've been doin' that for years. Why do you think I do that? I do that because I don't wanna chase anybody. I don't like to run. So I want you to give me the plate number. Hey, this is more like it. Partners are supposed to fight. Partner love/hate relationship. We don't have a love/hate relationship! We have a hate/hate relationship. I don't know how your grandmother can stand you. You must drive her bonkers. How do you know? You don't even live with us. Give me the plate number. Plate number: N-6-B-7-2-G. - Hey, Nick. - Go. We got a make on a '65 Lincoln Continental... registered to a D. Dimucci, 264 Bowman. Let's get a warrant and ransack the place. Wait a minute, 264 Bowman is a public library, and I figure Dimucci's a phony name also. [McKenna] A public library. Will you give me something that I can use? Bobo. Bobo who? Bobo I don't know. How many Bobos can there be? You better pray just one. [As Pee-Wee Herman] Bombing Butler. Aaah! - Come on, Jenkins. - Hey, can you do this one? - You don't wanna be like him. - [imitates Elephant Trumpeting] - What is this, the zoo? - Oh, it's a party, mac! - [Phone Ringing] - It's a party! I'm listening to you. Officer Butler here. Okay, lady, calm down. Calm down. What'd the cat look like? - No, I'm eight. - [Click, Dial Tone] Hello? Hello? Damn civilians. What do we got? We got three Bobos. [Clucking] Detective Butler here. Detective McKenna would like to ask you a few questions. - Go ahead, Nick. - [Clucking] Is your name Bobo? Oww! Oww! [Bobo] Ah, perfect. - Are you Mr. Bobo? - In blue. Listen. I don't think this is the guy. I didn't know art was so dangerous. How did you know he wasn't our Bobo? Well, lesson number two: You gotta trust your instincts. When you were in school, kids ever pick on you? Yeah. What'd you do? Oh, I'd handle it the best way I could. Hey, Nick, it's a code 73. What's today, Bobo? Today? I don't know. Feels like a Wednesday. Tell me! - Tell me! - You stay in the car. Don't get out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Indistinct Yelling In Spanish] Catherina, my mother gave us this. That's right. And you know what? She gave us this too! What the hell's goin' on here? Ask him, sir, Mr. Bobo. Ask him what day it is today! - Is your name Bobo? - I forgot our anniversary. You forgot your anniversary? - It's your anniversary? - I got a present for you, Bobo. No, no, no. Not the cards. - No, no, no. - All! All of your old baseball cards. No, no! [Speaking Spanish] - Don't, ma'am. - Detective Butler here. - What seems to be the problem? - Get in the car. Domestic altercations require two police officers. You're not a police officer! Get in the car! Can I talk to you for a minute? Never let civilians see us disagree. It undermines my authority. I'm disgusted. Really disgusted. [Speaking Spanish] When you stop being mad at him, you're gonna be real mad at yourself. Don't worry. I'll never stop being mad at him! Who are you, the Mickey Mouse patrol? Get your skinny little butt out of there before she throws you out of there. Nick, please, give me a second, okay? You think it's bad he forgot an anniversary? It's not so bad. I have these big jumbos who always throw me in the toilet... and worse yet, I have him for a partner. You two at least have each other, even though you don't have any more plates. Yeah, you may be right. I may be right. Bobo, start up the stairs. She can start down. You guys can meet halfway. [Blowing Kisses] Thank you. Instinct, right? - He wasn't the Bobo. - Right. You know what? You were very good back there. [Whispering] Yeah. What time you gonna pick me up tomorrow? - I'm not. - Why? You said I did a great job. You didn't kill me, I didn't kill you. I guess you did all right, But the deal was one shift. - But there's another Bobo. - Yeah. He pops up, I'll write you. I knew you would change your mind, Nick. I knew it. Give me your stuff. You're a good kid. So what happened? You shoot anybody? Nothing happened. Come on. Something must've happened. - Nothing happened. - All right. Hey, Ray, they want us to keep this stuff kind of hush-hush. You know, police business. Do you understand? Come on. I guess. So what do you want to do? Let's grab a Ding Dong. Hey, Ray, stop! Look! The black Lincoln. Get over here! - They know our neighborhood. - Who does? They want me, not you. Here, keep this in the evidence locker. I'll take care of it. Now turn around and walk out of here naturally. Naturally. Hey, how you doin', fart head? Mister big shot with the cops, huh? Don't you morons have anything else to do? - What'd you do that for? - 'Cause you called me a moron. So throwing your jacket on the ground makes you smarter? This kid's making me nuts. Hey, guys, I can't kid around anymore. I'm watching my grandma's car. Oh, so you're here with grandma? Mm-hmm. Oh, so this is grandmommy's car, huh? Hey, guys, please. Bust me up, but not the car. You mean don't do this? That's exactly what I mean. Or this? Ah, too bad. [Rio] My turn. This is your kiss good-bye. Ho! Hey, what are you doin'? Get out of here! I'll break your face! Wait'll I get my hands on you. We'll get you, you stupid, little brats. Let's get back in the car. Come on, let's go. Ah, look at this. These punks got no respect nowadays. Get in the car. Hi, Grandma. [Slams Phone] It finally caught up with you. What did? The new school counselor's here to see you. I hope you're happy. Just answer everything, truthfully. There you are. Hi, Devon. Hi. You recognize me? No. Hmm. I'm Mr. Goodman, the new counselor from school. You haven't seen me around school, huh? No. Well, let's sit down. So you know why I'm here? Uh, missing school today? Exactly. Now your grandmother tells me you've been helping the police find a very dangerous man. You won't believe the dirtbags we're af... Hello? Devon? You were saying? I didn't see them. I didn't see the bad guy's face. That's good. I mean, that's bad. Probably the police are disappointed. Oh, very disappointed. And mad too because I wasted their time. - Well. - I'm afraid we're out of cream. Gee. You know what? I'm gonna take a rain check on this... because I've got... ooh, I think I'll take one of these. I've got a few stops I have to make. Well, is everything all right? Oh, I'm very pleased with Devon. As a matter of fact, Devon's a good boy. You have a good day. Grandma! - Hey, hey, mister. Come here. - Damn. What? Excuse me, ma'am? Come here? I overheard your conversation. That woman can't control... Get your arm off me, madam, or I'll put you in a home. I cannot do my job with a kid around. I do not like kids. - [Rubio] Nick! - Why does he have to stay at my house? Why can't he stay with somebody else? Believe me, you wouldn't even be my second choice for him to stay with. The kid is comfortable with you. Come on, how long can it last? Give me a break here. Besides, you have such a lovely rapport with him. Let's go. You are going to listen to Mr. McKenna, right? - Detective McKenna? - Detective McKenna. Look at me. Devon, look at me. Now you won't leave here without him, right? Grandma, he's got a gun. I'm sure he has. And you won't leave him here and go around playing cowboys and Indians? Lady, the next time somebody breaks into your apartment, why don't you call the bunkhouse and ask for a cowboy. I'm sure they come a lot faster than you. I've been bustin' my chops all my life protectin' people! - Anybody seen Barnyard Cop? - What? He always asks his partner: What comes after "L"? - I don't know. - "Bow." Don't you get it? - Elbow! - [Coughs] You hit me one more time with your "L" -bow... and I'm gonna rip it off and wave it at you. You keep pullin' that attitude with my grandson. I don't have an attitude, lady, I'm just a police officer. I do not have an attitude. Come here. - Take care of yourself, Devon. - I will. - Hey, Nick? - Mm-hmm? Is a hundred grand the same as a hundred thousand? Yeah, why? The guy in the warehouse said it. "A hundred grand." I heard it was more like a hundred million. [Urinating] - Wait. Swords. - Hmm? - What swords? - Come on, it's fun. My friend Raymond can piss eight feet. Well, Raymond's my new hero. Just watch what you're doin'. - Come on, this'll be fu... - [Urinating On Nick's Pant Leg] Sorry. Good night, kid. - Hey, Nick? - Yeah? Aren't you gonna read me a story? You want to be a police officer, you gotta get your batteries recharged. Besides, you're eight years old. I'm not gonna read to you. Don't you know anything about kids? It relaxes us. Once upon a time... "Randy Milligan was released from the Kansas City Hospital Thursday afternoon... and planned to join his Baltimore teammates... for a trip to New York on Thursday night. Milligan was knocked unconscious after... he ran into second baseman Give me a break. It's a story. "Milligan was knocked unconscious after... he ran into second baseman Billy Ripken... while chasing a ground ball on Wednesday night. Milligan sustained a minor concussion... and left the field in an ambulance. Tests Thursday revealed no major damage besides a concussion. Milligan suffered a... a, uh... bruised cheekbone and..." Actually, the doctors don't have much hope for him... and they're gonna cut off his testicles. [Devon Coughing] Oh, boss, these are beautiful. [Humming] What'd you find out, Chu? Sir, the kid's with McKenna. Ohhh! - Why? - 'Cause I'm boiling. Are you gentlemen capable of doing anything right? Absolutely. With McKenna, huh? Erase him like a bad grade. You got it, boss. [Door Opens] [Door Closes] [Clattering] I just wanted a glass of milk. Incoming. So you're dumping the kid? I gave him to McPhail. McPhail already has some kids, all right? - I'm not used to this kind of stuff. - What kind of stuff? Look, I'm not a bodyguard, I'm not a baby-sitter. I have a routine. I have a routine to do. Uhhuh. Well, I guess the kid has gotten to you, huh? Give the kid to McPhail! He likes corn flakes in the morning. [Sighs] 38 in a 35 zone. What do you think, Devon? Do we let him slide? - I don't care. - You gotta help me out here, Devon. I was gonna let the guy slide, only you gotta be with me on this. We're partners here. And don't tell Rubio. - Okay, let him slide. - Hey. Good decision. - You'll make a good cop. - Nick doesn't think so. Hey, let me tell you something about Nick. Eight years ago, there was a drug bust and his partner was killed. Nobody's fault, but Nick blamed himself. You understand what I'm trying to tell you? After that, he wouldn't let anyone close. He wouldn't be friends with anything that breathed. But it wasn't his fault. I know that. Try convincing Nick. If he'd listen, I'd try. I know, I know. Come on, you're on duty. There's one we gotta nab. 38 in a 35 zone. Could let him slide. Please, we gotta nab this one. Please! - Book 'em, Dan-o. - Yes! Hey, hey, hey, you'll need this. - Thanks. - Wait a minute. You, pull over. Yes, officer? License and registration, please, Mr. Flemming. What's goin' on here? What are you... I'm your worst nightmare. An eight-year-old with a badge. I'm in a hurry, Butler... and I got a nightmare for you in my office. You know where that is. Don't sass me, Mr. Flemming. [Speaker] Officer Butler has full jurisdiction here. Step out of your car, please, sir. - [Flemming] Is this for real? - Out. Hands on the hood and spread 'em. - Any concealed weapons? - No. - I can explain. L... - Herman, if I don't do this, you will never learn... and I would be doing you a great injustice. - Flemming, right? - Yes. - Yes, what? - Yes, sir. Thanks. Due by Tuesday.

I don't want you comin' inside. You go in there, you hang around in that bar, you get hurt. - I can handle it. - Yeah. I thought this was a leather bar! Leave me alone! Hey, don't! Put that back down! - [Indistinct Shouting] - Come on. Hang around in the parking lot and you'll get hurt. Ooh, Francine gonna let it unwind You can look that way in a few years.

We had that nice little talk together? - Pity you didn't listen. - You're in trouble now. - Uh-oh. - [Laughing] You like music, Devon? Are you talkin' about that fifties crap they were dissin' in the car? I heard you sing. A cat chokin' on a hair ball sounds better than you. How would you know, hmm?
