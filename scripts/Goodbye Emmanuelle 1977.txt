Stop it, Seraphin. Is Madame Emmanuelle here? She's upstairs. - How are you? - Fine. - Madame Emmanuelle? - Yes, is that you, Angelique? - Yes. - Come in. - Hello, how are you? - Fine, and you? I'm fine. - I've brought your dress. - Perfect. Congratulations, Angelique. It's perfect. I could adjust it just a little bit more here. Wait. Ouch, you pricked me. One must suffer to be beautiful. Where did you learn that, with the nuns? Just a little. It's much better this way. You were right. Can you help me take it off? It's almost nothing. You'll have it tomorrow. Thank you. Do you know what's important in a dress? It should show just enough but not too much... ...so that men want to see more. That's just like you. That's all you think about. Don't you? Yes, but I'm not nearly as successful as you. What are you saying?! Do you know that Jean is very attracted to you? Really? Would you like to make love with him? - Wouldn't you be jealous? - No. I'm happy so long as he is. And besides... I like you. You're something else. That must be him. - I must be off. - No, stay. We'll surprise him. - Good morning, Sir. - Can you fix me a drink? - Yes, Sir. - Thank you. - Who's with Madame? - Angelique, Sir. - The seamstress? - Yes. Angelique. Congratulations. Oh, my... I hope my husband isn't home already. Are you happy with him? He's very jealous. Does he make love to you well? Every day, but too fast. He's not like Mr. Jean. He knows how to handle it. I didn't know it was so pleasant when we were three. My dear Sir. You'd never guess what happened to us. As we drove past the botanical gardens, we ran over a bird. - Mr. Celadon's parrot. - Who's Mr. Celadon? He had a broken leg. We took him to the vet. He wasn't there. He had gone to Sans Souci to treat a dog. So we went there. He put a cast on his leg. We waited for the cast to dry. Where is this parrot? We brought him back to Mr. Celadon. Who's Mr. Celadon? The fruit and vegetable vendor. The one with the wooden leg. - That's why Angelique is so late. - What a story! Florence had prepared a delicious fish tartar. It was raw tuna in lime juice... ...with a touch of nutmeg and pistachios. Cordier maintains it's a strong aphrodisiac. Not surprising coming from him. I like Cordier, after all. He's sexually obsessed, but he has no other ambition in life. Not even money. It's rare, don't you think? - You live there now, don't you? - Yes, so to speak. - You can start painting again. - Of course. Nicolas, put on your hat. Guillaume, tell him to put on his hat. Nicolas, will you listen to your mother, please? Look who's coming with Gerard? I'd like you to meet Vanessa. She's a stewardess with B.A. She's leaving tonight. She didn't know where to bathe. - Your first time in the Seychelles? - Yes. You really have to know the place to find the ocean here. - What did she say? - Nothing, it's just a joke. There's a place where you can change. Follow me. It's not necessary. I'm wearing my bathing suit. You know I waited for you last night at the disco. There were people over for dinner. It ended very late. Florence couldn't stay awake. We all went to bed. Of course. - Your little brother is so puritan. - It runs in the family. Vanessa! The sun is very dangerous this time of day. Let me rub on some cocoa oil. - Is that good? - Trust me. I'm a doctor. - What's new, Gerard? - Nothing much. The usual. I heard they're going to shoot a film in the area. - A film? - That's what I heard, too. Some sort of Robinson Crusoe story... It's in fashion right now in Europe... the return to the wild. We should eliminate travel agencies. Don't complain. This is still paradise on earth. Seychelles, jewel of the ocean... Seychelles, darling location... What's the matter? I've had it. He goes after all the women... look. It's provocation. It's lousy... Why does he do that? What if it amuses him? I'm not like you... I can't accept it. Aren't you being too dramatic? It's not serious. You know, if it weren't for the kids, I'd have left him long ago. Clara isn't liberated, that's all. It made me sad, really. She looked at the end of her rope. I don't feel sorry for her. She's too possessive, and lives with the fear of losing him. But maybe he didn't handle it right with her. I'm sure she doesn't like making love. But when we see such a couple... ...I think it's right to live the way we do. By the way, I have a surprise for you. Who? The tall Swede from the yacht club. I saw how you looked at him during the regatta. He wants to build a house so I told him about the rocks at Tatamaka. I told him you would accompany him. So? He went by, like the Phantom Ship... He saw me. He stared at me. It was that look of his that gave me an orgasm... ...while the Swede was making love to me. It was a strange pleasure... Almost painful. Can you still see him? Yes. Don't lose him! Don't lose him! - This boat here. - Yes. I rented it to a Frenchman the whole day, yesterday. - Do you know his name? - No. Or where he lives? At the hotel, I think. Did he say he'd be back? He didn't say anything. He just asked to be shown around the island, that's all. You're as fresh as morning dew. I'm as hungry as a wolf. Speaking of which! Is Chloe still asleep? - She wasn't with you? - Well, no. She prefers to sleep alone. To each his neurosis. Florence takes a shower every time she makes love. I shower when I'm too hot. What's the matter with these dogs this morning? We have to see each other more often. I had forgotten how pleasant it is to make love all together. Not l. Come on, the dogs... that's enough. Jimmy, Olga... quiet. That's sweet. It's him. Who? The Phantom Ship! What are you talking about? No kidding! This gentleman is a director. He's looking for exteriors for his film. I didn't catch your name. Perrin, Gregory Perrin. My wife, Florence... Emmanuelle and Jean... our friends. - Hello. - Hello. - We've already met, haven't we? - It's possible. Why are you laughing? Oh, nothing. Something Emmanuelle told me. Come... I'll show you my house. It has a history, you know. Really? It was built by a retired colonel of the Indian army. It's made entirely of teak. You can't put a nail through it. It's wood that the colonel had stolen when the English left. He brought an entire boat full. Good morning, everybody! Good morning. Good morning. Do you know Mr. Perrin? Oh, excuse me. What's with you? Someone with beautiful eyes like you shouldn't be modest. Especially in front of a director. Are you looking for a star? No, only settings. - What kind of settings? - Houses. What kind of houses? In ruins, rather old, and preferably isolated. There's the one on Digue Island. I can show it to you, if you wish. Is it far? No, it's in my bedroom. I painted it last year. Will you come? If you ask me, Chloe doesn't stand a chance. He only had eyes for Emmanuelle. What do you think? I don't dislike him. I'm going to see what they're doing. Hey, you'll tell us about it? Of course. She never gets tired. How do we get there? A boat leaves every morning. It takes a little under three hours. I can take you there if you want... with my husband's boat. No, thank you. I'd rather take the regular boat and see people. What people? I like your work. It's cheerful, isn't it? The country seems to inspire you. No more than any other. You know, after a while... ...you need to add cheerfulness in the landscape yourself. Can we go out here, through the garden? Yes. When will you go to Digue Island? Tomorrow. Say goodbye to your friends for me. Hello. I passed you with my boat. Didn't you see me? No. I suppose you want to visit the house right away? That's why I came. There are two means of transportation here: bicycle or ox cart. - Let's take the ox cart, then. - Come. Have you lived in the Seychelles long? Almost three years. Before that, we were in Bangkok and Hong Kong. Your husband works for the government? No, he's an architect. - Come on. - Is it here? No, the road ended. We'll go along the beach. - Is this the school? - Yes. There it is. Gregory! Do you know why I brought you here? Because I feel like making love with you. Really? - You aren't too excited by the idea. - I didn't say that. You are surprised because you don't know me. I have no prejudices. When I want something or someone, I say it. That's nice. It simplifies everything. Love is really the only thing that interests me. - That's all you do, then? - Almost. - Isn't it a little monotonous? - Not at all. All you need is some imagination. You're the one who gave me pleasure the other day on the rocks. I thought I saw someone with you. Who? Go ahead and undress. You undress me. You see, I do excite you. It's normal... you're very beautiful. Wait. Take your time. Don't move. Do you enjoy having a complaisant husband? Jean's not complaisant. He's happy to know that I'm happy. Even with someone else? It surprises you, doesn't it? And you never wondered what it might hide? Why should it hide anything? I don't know. It just doesn't seem natural. I wouldn't like to know that the woman I love is making love to another. - Do you prefer lies? - In that case, yes. You're very bourgeois after all. To love someone who loves you is so rare. To risk everything in the name of some bullshit truth... I don't see what's to be gained. I have to go. Why? Jean doesn't know I'm here. I thought you told him everything. I'll tell him when I get home... tonight. If I understand correctly, you had a good time, thanks to me. That shocks you? It'd shock me if I were in love with you. I'm sure that deep down you think I'm a whore. It just so happens that I love whores. Here the rate is 200 rupees. Here's 300. It was quite good. You bastard! Hello! - How are you, Guillaume? - I'm fine. You know, Clara left. She left? Where did she go? To her aunt's, with the children. What happened? I invited a little nurse home last night. After dinner, I could tell she was interested. Clara didn't seem to be against it at first. But when she saw us making love... she broke down... tears, shouting. If she doesn't like it, you can't force her. Obviously not. I have to go - I'm on duty. Goodbye, Jean. What will you do? I don't know. Do you want me to talk to her? She says that you two gave me such ideas, so... No, thanks. - Poor Clara. - Poor idiot, you mean. What can we do to help them? Let them work it out for themselves. What did you do today? I went to Digue Island. I saw the director we met that day. You follow through with your ideas? He turned out to be less interesting than I thought. - Did you make love? - Yes. Badly. It doesn't surprise me. As for me, I didn't waste any time. I met a little tourist who's dying to meet you. Really? Her name is Cecile. Just like in "The Liaisons." Quite a program, hey? Hello, children. How are you? Auntie, it's Emmanuelle! Isn't your mom here? Come see the turtles! You see, that's the oldest. Auntie says she's 1 00 years old. And that one is the mommy. She laid a big egg and buried it. Are you all right? - Did Guillaume send you? - No. - Did he tell you? - About the nurse... I'm really a petty bourgeoisie. That's not the problem. - Mommy! Come and see. - Wait, sweetheart, later. You know, at first, I tried to make him happy. But now it's over. I can't anymore. I finally understood everything the night we spent with Chloe. You see, if he wants me there, it's not because I'm wanted. It's to keep his conscience clear. Did you tell him? I didn't have to. My body spoke for me. From one day to the next, I became frigid. Yet, it was very nice before, you know. Angelique! - What happened to you? - It's my husband. He caught me talking to my neighbor. Talking? I was sitting on his lap... - You naughty girl! - Yes. You're lucky. Your husband isn't jealous. But neither am I ! Are you coming, Angelique? - Yes. Goodbye, Madame Emmanuelle. - Goodbye. To your loves, Cecile! To love! - What is this dance? - It's the sega. I was told of a dance that ends in an orgy... That's the moutia. It's much more primitive. It's more than a dance, it's a happening. When people drink too much, it degenerates. But Emmanuelle could tell you more about it than me. - Tell me. - No. - Yes. - I don't know anymore. Once, I was in an altered state... I was taken by two or three men. Four. You don't remember if you enjoyed it? Pardon? The night of the moutia... you said you were almost unconscious? No, she meant her pleasure lasted a long time. I brought her back exhausted. You can't understand. - I'm no longer a virgin, you know? - So much the better! Would you like to dance? No. Tell me more about your parties! Fine, then. Oh, I'm beat! You were superb, really! Oh, my heart. It's true. Can you feel that? Okay. I'll pay and we can go. Jean told me about you. You're a truly free couple. It's marvelous. I'd like so much to be like you. Why? What would you do with your freedom? I'll come to your place tonight. Smart, very smart! Look, I find her stupid. If you wanted her, you could have stayed. You know that without you, I don't find it fun. I don't know what's gotten into you lately... - Jean! - What? You know the girl who was with the director? Yes? I fancy her. - It might not be so easy. - Why? They seem to be perfectly in love... Didn't you notice? What happened the other day on the island? He threw me out, calling me a whore. What a jackass! Do you see what I see? Which one gave in do you think? Guillaume, of course. She must have blackmailed him with the kids. You're the most misogynistic womanizer I've ever known. Hello! - You okay? - Yes, I'm fine. You're happy? So, what's new? We're going to Kenya for two weeks. Why don't you come? We're leaving the children with Aunt Coralie. Yes, why not! It's rather quiet here right now. You know I hate safaris! We don't have to hunt. I don't feel like leaving. Well, if you change your mind... ...we can always arrange something with Gerard for the plane tickets. Even at the last minute! I don't understand you. Usually, you're the one who likes to travel. What's keeping you here? Can't you see they need to be alone? No. Guillaume seemed to insist. He's like all men... ...terrorized at the thought of being alone with her... ...and having to explain himself. If you should enter a room inadvertently... ...and are confronted with a naked woman... ...politeness requires that you say "Excuse me, Madame"... ...but tact, "Excuse me, Sir." One day, this server brings a dry martini to a room... ...and finds his client making love to a lady. He remembers his instructions regarding tact, and stammers... ..."Excuse me, the dry martini is for which of you gentlemen?" Can you give me a cigarette? There aren't any left. I have some in the bedroom. I'll be back. Do you like my husband? I've known you two for a while now. And? Look, with you, anything. I like you very much, but... ...with him, no way. I only like women, you see. - Exclusively? - Exclusively. What about Gregory? Gregory knows exactly what to expect. How did you meet Gregory? I acted in his first film, and then I lost touch with him for a while. I was very pleased to see him again. He looks relaxed. He seems to have overcome his problems. - Which problems? - With his wife. - He's married. - He was. But it went sour. They had decided to tell each other everything... ...be a modern, open couple. But the first time he told her he had a mistress... ...she threw herself out of a window. She died? No, fortunately she made it... after 6 months in the hospital. He stayed with her for fear she might do it again... ...until one day, she told him she was leaving him... ...for the surgeon who had treated her. What was she like? Very beautiful, somewhat aloof. A little bit like you. I'm aloof? I mean that you're the type of woman one can easily idealize. Yet you exist. One can touch you. And even caress me. I find you very desirable, you know. Poor Jean. You really have no luck. Dorothee doesn't like men. Well, that's all right. I can still watch you. Oh, absolutely not. I cannot stand a man watching me. So sorry. Listen, don't look that way. Fine. Good night. - He is gone? - Yes. Yes, he's gone. Tell me more about Gregory. Oh! How are you? What are you doing here? I live here now. The Cordiers took a liking... ...to a little stuck-up thing named Cecile... ...and made it clear that I was in the way...as usual. You should have come to our place. You're kind. I found myself an ornithologist. An ornithologist? Yes, an Englishman who just spent two months in Birdland... ...and studies the sexuality of seabirds. Did you know they invented group sex? What? It excites them to watch others make love next to them. The Cordiers must've been birds in a previous life. You haven't seen Gregory? I saw him going down to the beach. Are you still after him? Yes, but he's hard to catch. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Am I bothering you? - No, not at all. I was working. I've come to make peace. That's funny, because I dreamt of you last night. Really? We were on a boat. You were telling me to hurry up and make love... ...because your husband was coming back. Then a man was swimming towards us. Not your husband... ...but the black man with whom you were dancing. He threatened me with a harpoon. I wanted to dive overboard to escape him, but the sea was full of sharks. You were laughing. You're still suspicious of me. Of you, or of another woman... You know dreams don't necessarily mean what we believe. How's your location scouting? Fine, I still need to see Praslin Island. I plan to go there tomorrow. I can take you there. This is Silhouette Island. Chloe used to live here at first. Chloe is the girl who paints, right? Yes. She's staying at the hotel now. She arrived two years ago with an American poet. She was pregnant. But things went bad. She lost her child... ...and the doctor told her she couldn't have another. So, the American left and she found herself alone, without resources. She lived with one after another, selling her paintings. But she never got over it. Have you ever wanted a child? Jean doesn't want any. How about you? Sometimes I think about it. - Madame, there's fish over here. - How about fishing? Fishing? I've never done that. You know I was jealous of Dorothee? Yes, she told me. It never happened to me before. It's never too late. - You don't believe me. - I do. - And I don't dislike it. - Really? Let's stop at Ronde Island. There's a little restaurant. They'll prepare our fish. Watch it, there's another one. Your turn. It's not difficult, you saw? You must have found me horrible the other day. Yes, I did. I don't want to behave like this with you anymore. You don't want us to make love anymore? Yes, of course. But I'd like to start anew as if we'd just met. I'd like you to talk to me, to court me... Don't make fun of me, please. What is your movie about? It's the story of a guy who's fed up with the crazy life he leads... ...and goes to live on a desert island. - All alone? - At first, yes. Then comes a girl, a little lost girl. He tries to send her away, but she stays... ...and he finally falls in love with her. And then? So they live happily for a while... Until he notices that she's getting bored... So they go back to Europe, he resumes his former life... ...and there she meets another man and leaves him. - Your story isn't fun. - No. How was your wife? I don't like to talk about her. Do you still love her? I already explained I could only love one woman at a time. I'm sorry. Is that Praslin Island? Yes, we're almost there. The hotel is on the other side, near a large beach. You'll see. It's very isolated. Here they are. My darling. - We missed you. Hello. - Hello. Come on. - Did the trip go well? - Yes, thank you. Don't you think our islands are made for love? That is so true. Everything has been arranged. Gregory, you have the back bungalow. Albert, can you lead Monsieur? If you want a shower, come to my place. Jean wanted to be on the waterfront but there's only a sink... You don't seem happy to see us. I don't like cops. It was my idea, I wanted to show the coco fesses to Cecile. Pretend I'm not here. Gregory, are you there? - Let's leave, okay? - Why? It's a lovely place. Oh, don't be silly. And it's fun to see your husband and friends from a little closer... At first, Emmanuelle confused eroticism with vice. She wasn't totally wrong. There's no eroticism without the idea of sin. Here we go again! In India, China and Japan, the sin of the flesh doesn't exist... ...and yet they could give us lessons. We are too Christian to consider sensuality without... ...harboring the thought of doing something bad. Don Juan's real pleasure was to provoke God. Come on, Emmanuelle... ...that night when Edwin was making love to you right in front of us... ...didn't you feel you were committing a sin? As I was watching them, I was moved not only by Chloe caresses... ...but by the intense pleasure I felt the first time... ...I caught my parents making love. How old were you? Age is irrelevant for the bold! That's cheap psychobabble. Maybe, my dear Jean, but if we looked further... ...we'd find something similar in your need... ...to see Emmanuelle in those positions. What do you think of that? I haven't received any religious education. She dances poorly! Show her. I don't feel like making a spectacle of myself. Because of him? It didn't bother you the other night. I do what I want. You do what he wants. So what? It saddens me to see you kowtow in front of this righter of wrongs! Come on, Boy Scout. It shocks you, huh? Leave him alone. Are you out of your mind? Are you crazy? Stop it! Jean! Are you all right? I'm fine! I'm fine! Emmanuelle! Emmanuelle! Jean, don't be a fool. What sense does it make? Come, we'll end the night with Cecile. Come and see. Come and see. How will we get back? I'll have Gerard come to fetch us. Philoe tells me you're looking for a house to shoot a film? Yes, that's right. - Have you found one? - Not really. In that case, I'd be delighted to show you mine, if you wish... Yes, gladly. Congratulations, Sir. Your wife is very, very beautiful. It's the house of a man who lives alone. When my wife was still alive, it was more stylish. It smells good... of cinnamon. My great grandfather was already selling spices. He was one of the first Englishmen here... ...at the time of your Napoleon. If you wish to smell this. One used to see pirate ships pass along the islands. The pirates would rest on the beaches with their beautiful black slaves. Ah! The world has changed. Back then, women were submissive. Now they rule. Have you been married long? Only two days. Susan and l. Look how beautiful she was. What happened to her? A horrible thing, Madame, fortunately rare in this area... a shark. Some fishermen had caught a giant turtle... ...and they were cutting it up in the water by the shore. It made a big blood spill going out to sea. It's the blood that attracted the shark. I watched her being devoured in front of me... ...and I couldn't do anything. I thought I wouldn't be able to survive without her, but then... ...life always takes over. To talk to Hin, yes, that's right. Call me here, right, around what time? Goodbye. So, you met old man Snow? He's marvelous, isn't he? He's completely crazy. It's understandable after what happened! His wife being eaten by a shark? Did he tell you that? It's horrible. But Susan isn't dead. She used to sleep with everyone... ...until she left with a naval officer! Snow prefers to think of her dead than in someone else's bed. Look! Do you remember? The small fish market. Pity we can't land here. I'd have liked to see the house again. Look, we'll come back tomorrow by boat and spend a few days. Where to, Sir? - The yacht club, please. - Why? To pick up the car and go back home. No... you're coming to the hotel with me. After what happened, I owe Jean an explanation. On the pillow? As usual? I want everything to be clear, don't you? It's all very clear. Tomorrow, you and I ... ...are leaving for one week, and it's none of his business. No, but I never hid anything from him. Fine, as you wish. I'll come to see you at the hotel tonight. Call first. I may be busy. Silly! Angelique! Ah! How are you? Very well. Who is he? Come and say hello to Madame Emmanuelle. - Hello. - Hello. Is he the neighbor? No, he's my sister-in-law's brother. - What about your husband? - He's away fishing. Have a nice evening then. Yes, thank you. Mr. Perrin, a telegram for you. A telegram? Thank you. Could you get me the post office? Yes, you can count on me. Good evening, Sir. - Who is it? - Mr. Perrin. What did he want? He must go back to Paris tonight, and wanted to tell Madame. He wants her to call when she gets in. I'll tell her. He told me it was very important. Do you want a whiskey? I'll help myself... don't bother. You can leave... it's late. How's your daughter? Much better, thank you. - Good night, Mr. Jean. - Good night. - Already home? Have you seen Jean? - Not yet. I wanted to hear the news. You're playing a strange game with him. I'm not playing... I do as I please, as usual. Won't you spoil everything? I'm a little tired of this life. It's normal. People get tired of everything. I went through that, too. I almost left Michel once. Why didn't you? Because... ...this type of love doesn't last. You'll become older, less pretty. Someday, you won't be desirable. I think of it all the time. I know I'll always be able to hang on to Michel. He'll probably die while making love, and certainly not in my arms. But at least I will have been his only true accomplice against death. That's what matters... don't you think? Yes. - There's no reply. - That's impossible... try again. I'll call you back. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Are you going out? - Yes, with you. I reserved a table at the Sirene. That's good. I wanted to talk to you privately. - Can you get dressed? - Yes, I'll be a minute. I acted like a fool last night. It's true that you weren't yourself. No, I wasn't. - Yes. - It's still busy, Sir. - Fine, forget it. - I'm still trying. No, forget it. - Chloe. - Hello. Do you know where Emmanuelle lives? Yes... in Anse Royale. Why? - I must talk to her right away. - What's going on? Nothing, come. Hello, Mr. Jean. Your table is ready. I want to take her to Paris with me. Is that so? She won't spend her whole life with this bunch of zombies. Do you have something better to offer her? At least, not this comedy. I find them grotesque with their ramblings about eroticism. Their so-called complicity as a free couple. To each his own, you know. There's no one. What do you mean? Where are they? How should I know? At a restaurant, or with friends. - At the Cordiers? - No, they were busy tonight. We'll check every restaurant in town. You know what time it is? We barely have time to pick up your luggage at the hotel... ...or you can wait 2 more days for another plane. Another plane in two days? No, it's impossible. I must be in Paris tomorrow. Shit! Shit! You'll be back. It's most unlikely. The film has been canceled. You have something to write with? Yes, in the car. I used to be happy to see you happy. Even with others. But with him... It drives me crazy. You're jealous. Yes. It's a feeling which disgusts me. Why? It's proof of love. I thought we had gone beyond this type of love. Apparently not. It's a mess of gears, do you understand? Until now, we had managed not to get caught in it. What's the use living the way we have, just to reach this point? I'm capable of the worst to keep you. Don't say that. The worst. I must have left the key in the car, could you... - I can't find it... it's not here. - I have it. Ah, excuse me. - I'm going to pack my bag. - Already? I'll meet him at the hotel tonight. We're leaving early tomorrow. Fine. - Hello? The Northholme Hotel? - Yes, Madame. I'd like to speak to Mr. Perrin, please. He isn't here, Madame. Did he say when he'd be back? Mr. Perrin took the plane for Paris tonight. - How could that be? What? - Goodbye, Madame. What's the matter? They said he left for Paris tonight. It's not true. It's not possible. Call the hotel back to confirm it. It must be a mistake. I'm going. What if it's true? I'll go with you. Emmanuelle. Take this. I'll sleep in the living room. I have a meeting at a site tomorrow. I must leave very early. I won't wake you. Thanks. Get some sleep. Wake up! Oh, it's you. What's the matter? Are you sick? No. I took a sleeping pill. - Gregory has left. - I know. Where were you last night? Last night? - Seraphin, can you come please? - I'm coming, Madame. It's impossible. Jean couldn't have done this to me. And yet it's the only explanation. I can't believe it. Come in, Seraphin. - Good morning, Madame. - Good morning. Did Mr. Perrin call last night? Yes, Madame. Why didn't you tell me? I had asked Mr. Jean to tell you. You didn't find a letter under the door this morning? No, Madame. There was no mail this morning. Thank you, Seraphin. You see. Do you have Gregory's address? Jean. You are here? You're too late. Emmanuelle is gone. She asked me to explain. There's nothing to explain. I gambled everything... And I lost. - Go after her. - No. She has to go to the end of that story. Besides, she'll get tired of him quickly and she'll be back. I don't think so. Who knows? What will you do all alone in this big empty house? Oh, with some imagination... - Please, Sir. I wanted to ask you... - Yes? ...about dinner tonight? Two settings, Seraphin, as usual. Marie, do you have the ticket? Here... I always thought that Jean shared you to better keep you. He let you make love with whomever you wanted, but controlled it all. Perhaps. He's just like the others. A little more clever, that's all. It's not true. We've been very happy. We really tried to live another way. I don't think that's the right solution... Me neither, now. But it's not a reason to go backwards. And Gregory... What does he think of all this? I don't know. I barely know him. He may be a tyrant in his own way. But... I'll find out. In any case, I won't be back. I need a new life. I'm suffocating here. If you think you'll breathe easier in Paris! Here, it's all ready. You connect in Nairobi. You have a five-hour wait. You arrive in Rome at midnight. The next day, you leave for Paris. I don't see why you don't wait for the non-stop flight tomorrow? I don't want to see Jean. How about your trip to Kenya? Guillaume is busy at the hospital. It's canceled. Are things better between you? Yeah... It's time to go. - You'll write, won't you? - Of course. Goodbye, children! Emmanuelle loves caresses of the mouth and hand Emmanuelle loves the intellectuals and the laborers Emmanuelle did not learn loving from the books Emmanuelle needs her annual dose of "I love you"
