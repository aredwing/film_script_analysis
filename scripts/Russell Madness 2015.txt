And finally got what I always wanted... a family. Oh, no, that's not me. That's me, Russell. The Jack Russell Terrier. Every story begins somewhere. And every dog has his day. Some would say I come from humble beginnings. We'd spend our days vying for the attention of kids to take us home and make us part of their families. There was me. I used to be a real scaredy-dog. This is Russell. Aw, he's so cute. - Oh, pee pee. - Oh, sorry. Russell doesn't usually do this. He's normally a very sweet puppy if you just... Just give him a chance. I always did this. Oh... Russell, you have to stop peeing on all the customers. Or you'll never find a family. What are you scared of, anyway? It was a good question. That was just the way I was. And the way I figured it, I was going to stay that way forever. But little did I know, my luck was about to change, when the Ferraro family moved back to Portland. - Here we are. - Great! Well, this is it. That's Nate, Colleen, their son, Max and daughter, Lena. And that's the legendary, totally awesome, Ferraro Wrestling arena. Amazing! - Oh! - Whoa! Here we go. Whoa! Wow! Max, wait for us before you go inside. Wow! "The strongest tag team is family." Hmm. ' - Ooh! This place rocks. If you like the Stone Age. And the greatest wrestler of all time. The great Maximiliano Ferraro II enters... Okay, I know this sounds crazy, but I can feel your Papa Maximiliano's presence here. - Really? - Yeah. Maximiliano bounces off the ropes and takes the evil Crusher down with a clothes line. I wish we could just give the building a face lift - and flip it, you know? - Oh, no, no. It's so nostalgic. What's "stolgic"? Yeah. See. He pits the Crusher and... Come on, Nate. We're finally going to get some quality family time, remember? No more 12-hour-days at the office. He wins the belt! He did it! Max, honey. Okay. Looks exactly how I remember it as a kid. Well, your papa definitely had a particular taste. Yeah, it's called "mid-century Guido". Remember, all Papa said in his will was... yes... "Return our profit within one year and the building is ours to sell." Then we can all go back to San Diego, and forget that this ever happened. "Ferraro Wrestling." You dropped your dolly. Where did you get that? I think it's the monkey's. Lena, when are you going to grow up? I'm only six and a half, Max. I see you found the costume room. I knew it wouldn't take you too long. Mm-hmm. My grandma taught me to sew on a machine just like this. I never thought I'd get to use them again. They don't make them anymore. These old costumes are pretty great. What? Now that was a tiny wrestler. Cute. I'm going to check on the kids. Okay. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You don't want him unless you get covered in... Come on, honey, let's go. - Derek take him. - Sure, boss. Come here, little guy. It is okay. You're okay. Guess what? It's Russell's anniversary. He's no longer a puppy, which means he's pound bound. Oh, boy, you're in trouble. What's the pound? It's a place where rejects go, because no family wants them. No family wants me? But that's all I want, is a family. Russell, if I were you, I'd get out of here as fast as I could. You got to give him another chance. Let's face it. Russell's the runt and he's had way too many chances already. Then I will take him. Look... I can't let him end up at the pound. - Hey, buddy. You all settled in? - Yeah. - Where did you get that? - Lena found it. Okay. Can I see? You know, I haven't seen this since I was your age. The original ll Maniac gave this to me. I used to play with him all the time. Yeah, front flips, back flips, body slams, right? I had so many cool moves. Here you go. - You keep him safe, he's yours now. - Really? Of course. - What's this? - It says "Ferraro Wrestling". No way. Wow. You know, Papa Maximiliano started this whole place with nothing more than passion and a dream. Who's the monkey? Old Maximiliano was an interesting character and that was his monkey, Hunk. He referred to him as his partner. Like a mascot? Yeah. Kind of. What was it like back then? Back in its heyday, in a time called the '80s, the Ferraro Wrestling Arena was the place to be... Welcome fans, to Thursday Night Mayhem at Ferraro Wrestling. I'm so excited, I'm like a kernel Popcorn, 'H'? - about to... Don't mind if I do, Mike. We had the best talent in town. But none were better than ll Maniac. Il Maniac! Whoa! Ooh! ll Maniac is still the heavy weight champ. He really did have it all. The talent, fans... everything. - What happened? - Mick Vaughn came to town. Mick wanted to buy us, along with all the other wrestling businesses on the West Coast. He called it "WUF". The Wrestlers United Federation. And Papa Maximiliano, he wanted to preserve Ferraro Wrestling as a family business for generations to come. But, pretty soon Papa couldn't afford to pay the wrestlers. It was like the mat was pulled out from underneath us. My dad knew it was a sinking ship and he moved us away. Losing the business Papa could handle, but losing his family... it broke his heart. Dad, we can bring Ferraro Wrestling back to its glory days. No, buddy, it's... a different era now. That bell has rung. But you always told me, just because you lost the round, does not mean you lost the match. Okay, that's... That's true, but... Yeah, let's just put this away. Okay. All right, my boys. It's lights out. Good night. - Dad? - Mm-hmm? Why did you name me after Papa Maximiliano? Because guys named Max are always the best guys to have in your corner. All right. Some new pugs are moving in. So, it's time to go to your new home. Oh, no, he's taking me to the pound. I have to get out of here. What the heck? Hey! What are you doing with that dog? Russell! Hey, boss, what happened? Where's Russell? I don't know why, but that dog just bolted. What? But I just adopted him. I was going to take him home. I had a lead on some local wrestlers that know how to draw a crowd. - Ooh! - MmHmm. Yodel-ay-hee-hoo? Hello, Dieter Das Mountain. Nein, Dieter Das Mountain. - Oh, Dieter Das... - Mountain. Mountain? Oh, sorry about that. - Hi, I'm Nate Ferraro. - Oh, hi. My name is Nate Ferraro - from the Ferraro Wrestling. - What do you want? Yeah, how would you like to wrestle - in a match... - The classic arena. - ...at our classic arena? - Nein, I work for Mick Vaughn. - Mick Vaughn? - You know him? - I know of him. Right. - I will be blacklisted. I totally understand. I wouldn't want to be blacklisted either. - Blacklisted? - Yodel-ay-hee-hoo. And a yodel-ay-hee-hoo, to you too. So much for that. Wait, I have an idea. Scooch, scooch. Craigslist, Portland. Wrestlers. Voila! Yeah, I know, right? That is, like, so cool. Wait, you're Ferraro Wrestling? Yeah. You guys just re-opened, right? You guys should come Thursday. I'm kind of busy. I can get you guys free hot dogs. - Sure. - Okay. I'll see you there. - See you there. - Yeah, that sounds great. - Hot dogs! - Yeah, hot dogs! Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish, I wish tonight. Please help me find a family. I'll never leave you again, ll Maniac. - Ah-hah! - Ooh! It's you. I knew you were real. So, you got me, kid. Now, what? You can talk! Wait till Max finds out. Whoa. Whoa. Wait a second. Slow down. I'm just here to pick up a friend. You never saw me. Not a chance. No one ever believes the kid. Everything's a negotiation. Everyone wants something. Name your price. Why do I get the feeling I'm going to regret this? Would you like some sugar with your tea, Mr. Hunk? How about two lumps to the head, please? Huh? Hello there. Who are you? - Uh, Russell. - Hey, Russ, I'm Dozzo. What is that? A T-bone steak? Would you... Would you like to share it? You see, Russ, this is my turf. Any food left out here is rightfully yours truly. - Got it, mate? - I guess so. I have a condition called low blood sugar. I have to eat every few seconds, or else I'll get "hangry". Hangry? You know, when you get so hungry it makes you angry. HangrY- Why don't you pick on someone your own size? - Blimey! - Step away from that steak! Or I'll take you to school like a bus driver. I don't want any trouble, mate. Now scram! Beat it! Vamoose! Cheerio! You got to learn to stick up for yourself, kid. You can't let a bully dog intimidate you like that. - Who are you? - The name's Hunk. - What's yours, kid? - I'm Russ. Russell. How did a nice kid like you end up in the mean alleys of Portland? No one wanted me. I was pound bound, so I escaped. A spunky runaway like me. Now eat up, kid. Speaking of food, it's banana time. I got to split. Arrivederci. Uh, thanks, Mr. Hunk! We are back today! Twenty-five years later, and nothing has changed. In our first match we have seasoned veteran, Vick Vice. You know, Vick Vice is returning from a sabbatical at Penn State. At Penn State. Mike, I think that's state pen. How about you, ref? I'm gonna throw you out. - No, that's not right. - Vick Vice in the house. And it looks like Vick has been rehabilitated. Yeah. Facing Vick Vice is newcomer Brady Malibu! Maliboom! I wonder why they call him Vick Vice? Well, now, I think that answers that question. Dude! That's gnarly. No, no... What are you doing? Get in the ring. I'm not fighting that dude. Did you see what he did to that cinder block? - I thought you were a wrestler. - Ah, swimsuit model, surfer, wrestler, what's the diff? What's the diff? It's actually a big difference. Fine, fine. I will double your fee to 200. Three Bennies and I'll drop in on the dude, Malibu style. - Sure, sure. - Okay. One Benny, two Benny, three Benny. Here you go. What? All right. Yeah. Go for it. Not the board. Oh! That was another in the Vick Vice. Boo to you! - Nice move! - All right! All right, huh? Surfs up! - He's surfing. - Hang loose, man. Yeah. Brady Malibu is hanging ten on Vick Vice. - That's two! - All right. Here is Vick Vice with - a massive spinning head slam! - Okay. Yeah, that's going to leave a mark. - Vice grip! - Oh, here's the Vice grip. He's in trouble now. Oh, no. - Stop the fight! - No, keep the match going. No, no. Stay in the ring. Catch you on the flipside, bro. It looks like Brady Malibu - is headed for the beach. - Dad, are you all right? Come here, referee, where's my belt? - You! Come here. - Oh, come on. Looks like we have some time to catch up. So, what have you been up to for the last quarter century, Mike? Oh, well I became a chimney sweep. That actually exists outside of Mary Poppins? - Okay. I'm all right. - You okay? Yeah, I think so. Okay. Honey, what happened? A lot! Give me the costume. I am going to be your superhero. Okay, as much as I would love to see you in spandex, are you sure you should get into the ring with Vick Vice? I don't have a choice. Max, you go tell Mike and TJ, no matter what happens, just to play along. Okay, got it. Tell us, Mike, what is the key to sweeping a good chimney? The key is having the right tools. Yeah. The modern chimney sweeps use more than just a brush. Yes. You have your your double worm screw, your hinged drop scraper, and the always, always helpful boring tool. Whoops! - You're a boring tool. - Hey! - We have one other question... - Oh... My dad said to play along - no matter what, okay? - All right. Tell him to make it quick. We're running short of material and this audience is receding quicker than Mike's hairline. - Yeah. Hey! Wait a minute. - Okay. Who will face me? Who is man enough? Will somebody fight the pansy? Don't make me come down there. I know, I know, I'll calm down. You're right. I need some potassium. I will! I've got nothing to lose! Hello there, Russ. Is that a juicy, possibly turkey sausage? Nope, it is a worm. A disgusting, not at all Bavarian worm. A worm? 'Cause it smells like a turkey sausage with a little bit of Bavarian mustard on it. Who's gonna save you this time, matey? Blimey! Come back here, you little ratter. Mama, look! A doggy! Okay, I can do this. Just stay calm. Okay, what the... Huh? Hey, go get the dog. Dude, what do I look like, a dog walker? You're not much of a wrestler. It's Brady Malibu and... a dog? - A dog! - Come on, Malibu! What's the kid doing? Hey, wait. Max said to go with it no matter what. - Okay. - Yeah. Well it appears that the only man man enough is not a man at all, but a dog. - Call the dog catcher. - Come on! Oh, this is not going to be good. All right, doggy! I'm going to teach you a new trick! The kid doesn't stand a chance. I can't watch. What is going on? What is this? He's got him in a chokehold. - He's done. - Don't film it. He's got him! Woo-hoo! And down goes Vick Vice. Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. The kid has moves! ' Yes! - Three! He is out! - Yes! - This is incredible! - The winner! - Yes, he won! - The dog has beaten Vick Vice! What? Why is everything spinning? You think he's going to be okay? Well, he is a little malnourished, dehydrated and in desperate need of a bath, but other than that, I think he's fine. - Can we keep him? - Yeah, can we keep him? He can be friends with the monkey. Lena, your monkey's only a toy. He probably has a family somewhere. We don't know who he belongs to. Hi, little guy. I'm Max. And this is my sister, Lena. Don't be afraid, little puppy. We won't hurt you. He doesn't have a collar. He could be homeless. Just perfect. Now we truly are the laughing stock of the wrestling world. Can he please stay? All right. He can stay for the night. ' Yes! ' Yes! Last night was so embarrassing... There he is. The newest YouTube sensation. Uh, what do you mean, YouTube sensation? Are you not aware that a video of last night's match had over a million views on YouTube? The dog's trending on Twitter. He's all over instagram. - Your wrestling dog is a star. - Any comments? - Wow! - And when is his next match? - His next match... - Next Thursday. Next Thursday. But you said we were going to give the dog back to the pound. - Oh, no. Not the pound. - She's a little confused. You heard the boy. Next Thursday! Yep! Ferraro Wrestling, and we hope to see everyone down here for the wrestling event of the millennium. Will Russell get star billing? How did you teach your dog to wrestle? See what I mean? The little guy can't wait to get back to training. That's the gym. And so we meet again. - Hunk? - Yup! Russell, allow me to introduce you to ll Maniac. Or as I call him, the Italian Stallion. I like your style, kid. You had some great moves last night. - Uh, great moves? - Yeah, in the wrestling match. When you chocked out Vick Vice. Oh, I have a question, Mr. Hunk. What's wrestling? Wrestling is when two large men battle their hearts out in the ring. In front of their fans. Asking for nothing more than pride, glory, and of course, a large sum of money. - You know, wrestling. - Oh? Follow me, kid. All this could be yours. How would you like to be a wrestler? But I'm not a large man. I'm a small dog. Russell, my boy, the sooner you learn this the better. It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog. You're saying I can wrestle? You've got the gift, Russ. And with the right trainer, namely me, I think you could be one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. Doesn't that sound amazing, being one of the greats? That sounds like a lot of pressure. Yeah, well, do you want to live your life under the ring? Hiding, always wondering, but never actually experiencing what the world has to offer? - Well... - No. The answer is no! You want to be king of the ring. Master of the mat. Pharaoh of the... Let me get back to you on that. Look, kid, I know we just met, but I've got a nose for talent. It's just what I really want is a family. I think I can arrange that. How about the Ferraros? Really? You think those people... they would be my family? Sure, kid. They're counting on you to wrestle. I have a family? I have a family! In that case, I'll wrestle! Hot diggity dog! All right, Russ. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I still have to negotiate the deal. You have to negotiate to get a family? Technically, no. But in reality, everything's a negotiation. Now, let's go speak to the people. You speak People? But you're a... A monkey, yes. A monkey who can speak People, Zebra, Feline, Canine obviously, Pachyderm and little bit of Squirrel like "Pass the nuts." I speak like six different species. It's a talent. I'm gifted. - Enough said. - But how? Animals can't speak to humans. Inquisitive fellow, aren't you? Well, it goes like this: I was imprisoned, part of this experiment to see if humans could teach monkeys to talk. You know, monkey see, monkey do, yada, yada, yada. Flower. Then I made a big mistake. Banana. Oops. What can I say? I lost it. I'm only a monkey. The jig was up. I knew I had to escape. Then I walked in the ring. Met Maximiliano. He introduced me to the greatest sport of all time. And the rest is wrestling history. Two million one hundred eighty-seven and sixty-two views! It's just as amazing on video. Look at his leap. We can't find him anywhere. Yo! Attention, Ferraros! Family meeting, ring side! - Who said that? - Pronto! Okay, I know that voice. Look, he's not scared anymore, are you, boy? The kid's got a name. It's Russell. Okay, seriously, who said that? - Over here, Nathaniel. - Monkey! Hey, now, you don't see me jumping around and shouting "Ah, human!" Hunk? - It's you? - In the flesh... and fur. Wait, Nate, you know this monkey? Of course he knows me. We were once pals. Amigos, inseparable. See, I told you he was real, Max. No one ever believes the little sister. But... But you can talk like... You're using words and things. And I thought I just made that part up. You know, like an imaginary friend. Well, I'm not imaginary. I'm a real monkey with real emotions, Nate. And all this time, not a phone call, a Tweet, an email, Instagram, nothing? - You... have email? - No. Nor do I have an iPhone, Facebook, or Twitter. But that's not the point. The point is... ll Maniac and I, we thought you forgot about us. And then when you got here, to make matters worse, you acted like you didn't even care. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Hunk. You need to apologize to both of us. Um... You want me to apologize to a toy figurine? Yup! Right. Sure... ll Maniac, Hunk, I am so sorry. Really, please forgive me. Okay. Great! Let's hug it out. Come on. No, no. It's too soon for the mushy stuff. Unless we're talking mushy bananas, but I digress. I think introductions are in order. Oh, of course. Of course. This is my wife Colleen. - Hello. - Ciao bella! - I'm Max. - Good to meet you, kid. And this is my beautiful daughter Lena. Yes, we've met. She is quite the negotiator. We had a tea party. Enough of the pleasantries. Let's get down to brass tacks. Obviously, as your new star wrestler, Russell will have some strict conditions. Number one: Russell is officially part of the Ferraro family. He will get no less than two ripe banana bunches. Yellow, no spots. Seven blended banana smoothies, and 12 banana popsicles weekly. What can I say, the kid's wild about bananas. - Right. - And of course, if Russell decides to wrestle, I'll be his trainer. Did you say you're the trainer? Mamma mia! Do you think ll Maniac became a legend on his own? - Uh... - Huh? - Well, do you? - No. - You trained the ll Maniac? - Yup! Yes, the Sefiora Karen has a question. It's Colleen. What about his family? He doesn't have one. But how do you know? I speak Canine as well, obviously. - Obviously. - Of course. Do we have a deal, Nate? Sure, why not? Barn! We're back in business, baby. Mr. Hunk, do you think, maybe, you could train me too? Sure, kid. Russell's going to need a training partner. Got you! You got banana bombed. All right, intimidate me. Watch and learn, kids. Hey, where did everybody go? One. Hold it steady, Russ. Channeling your inner chi will give you the strength to defeat men ten times your size. The Stinging Dog. Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee. Dogosaurus Rex. Okay, come on, Russ. All right. What you lack in size, you make up for with quickness and agility. Watch and learn. Boom, baby! Woo! Russell! Come on, Russell. Go on. I'll watch your form from the back. I'm going backwards. Help! Help! Where are the breaks on this thing? Oh, no! Oh, come on! Yeah, that's gonna leave a mark. You okay? I got it. - Team Russell Mania! - Team Russell Mania! This is an enthusiastic crowd here tonight, Mike, thanks to the mania created by YouTube sensation Russell Maniac. Oh, that's right, TJ. Who will win the battle royale? The last man, or mummy standing, will face the incredible Russell Maniac! And Neanderthal has gone extinct. That's check and it's over, matey! The winner! I know you're nervous, kid. Heck, I'm petrified for you. On the plus side, if you do get hurt, the bandages are really close by. What happened to "it's not the size of the dog in the fight it is the size of the fight in the dog", stuff? You're right, Russy baby. I lost it there. You're going to do great, kid. Believe in yourself, Russell. You can do it. Are we ready for the main event? It's time to Russell! - Russell! - Russell! I say this mummy is wound tight and ready to go. Go, Russell! I want a clean fight. Protect yourself at all times. Bad breath! All right, shake hands or paws. - What? - Come on, Russell! I want to wish you luck in our upcoming battle. May the best wrestler win. Russell, no! Don't shake paws with him! Don't, Russell! Russell! Oh, no! The mummy has Russell in the spin cycle! - Uh oh. - Oh no! What are you doing? Your chi, Russell! Channel your chi! Wait a minute. The Russell Maniac is getting up. The Russell Maniac is unleashed. Oh, yeah! - good, Russell! Things are starting to unravel for the mummy. Yes! Yeah! The mummy goes down for the count. - One! - Yeah! TWO! Three! He's out! Looks like this match is a wrap! Yeah! - The winner! - This is madness. This is Russell madness. Good job, Russell! Russell! Russell! Russell! This is amazing. Everyone loves me. You're the king of the ring, Russy baby. Yeah. What a match. You showed that mummy who's daddy. You got it. Russell's got the moves. Oh, that was genius, Nate. That was just genius. Mick Vaughn. - Wrestlers United Federation. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, Mr. Vaughn, I know who... I've heard of you. I just didn't expect to see you here, that's all. Or the dead skunk that's on your head. Guy with a sense of humor, huh? That's your grandfather's monkey, isn't it? That's... That's right. I came here to talk to the organ grinder, not the monkey. And I'll grind you into the ground. Place still looks the same and frankly smells the same as when your grandfather Maximiliano ran it. We think of it as nostalgic. Oh, yeah, that's a good word for it, nostalgic. That's cute. So, uh, what brings you by, Mr. Vaughn? Oh, I'm just a paying customer just like the rest of them. Right there. I heard what was happening, thought I'd come down and have a look-see and... that's brilliant. Where did you ever come up with the idea for a wrestling dog? He's a slimeball, Nate. Look at that orange spray tan. Listen to his jokes. Just stop monkeying around. No, I'm not monkeying around. I'm serious. Well, you see, back in the day when your grandfather was around, it was all about wrestling, but today, no, frankly it's about entertainment. Now, I happen to run the largest live event outfit on the entire of West Coast. We've got pay-per-view, we've got merchandising, we've got the YouTube on the Interweb. You and I could work well together, son. We could make Russell the biggest show on Earth. Take the Ferraro family name right back to the top of the wrestling world. Right. That's a fantastic opportunity, but we're on fire, right now. So, I think we'll have to respectfully pass. But thank you, Mr. Vaughn. Yeah, well, you know, don't burn the place down. No. I won't. I'm sure, you won't. You're a smart kid. - Thank you. - Yeah, a real smart kid. Good work tonight, Russell. I'm proud of you. What am I? Chopped bananas? Which, by the way, with a little warm milk are very tasty. You too, Hunk. We wouldn't be here without you. - All right, night night, buddy. - Night, Dad. Sweet dreams. Thank you for making my wish come true. Who're you talking to, kiddo? - My wishing star. - Wishing star? I don't believe in all that mumbo-jumbo make believe stuff. It's all about hard work and perseverance, kid. And I might add a supremely talented coach. I guess, but everything I wished for came true. I have friends, family, and someone that believes in me. Thank you for training me, Hunk! Hey, let's not dwell on one match, kid. - It's too soon to celebrate. - You're right. Well, good night, Hunk. You too, ll Maniac. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Bugs? Where? I hate bugs! Well, it looks like we finally broke even. One more match and we are into the money! Woo! I knew you had it in you, Nathaniel. I guess wrestling is in the Ferraro blood. You know, now that you've had a taste of sweet, sweet success, it seems like you might not be in such a hurry to sell the building and move back to San Diego. - Am I right? - Maybe. Hello! Is anybody here? - Who's that? - I'm not sure. Oh, I'm sorry. We're closed. Tickets will be on sale in few days. - I'm Bernadette Olsen. - Oh, nice to meet you. You can call me Bernie. The building inspector. Hi, Bernie. Ms. Bernie, I didn't order an inspection so... Yes, and I think that may be the problem. I'm sorry to say that in addition to structural maintenance required, the electrical system is... - ...shocking! - Oh, Bernie! - Bernie! Bernie! - Bernie! You okay? Let's have a look at your sprinkler system. This sprinkler system's on the fritz. Can you hand me a monkey wrench, please? Oh! This thing expired in 1986. - See, it doesn't even work. - I wouldn't monkey with that. Is that really necessary? Please, Mr. Ferraro, I'm a professional. Oh! Oh, boy. Basically the building isn't up to fire code. I estimate, and this is ballpark, of course, $64,894 and ten cents. I don't have that kind of money. I'd have to put on two, three, four, 50 matches to raise that. I can't allow any matches in this building until it's brought up to code. It's out of my hands. Surely there's something you could do. What did the ratted, twisty piece of string say, Mr. Ferraro? - I'm not sure. - I'm a frayed knot. Good day, Mr. Ferraro. What are we going to do? If I had dollar for every time I heard that, I'd be even richer. Nate, tell me we're not making a deal with this cheese ball. We don't have a choice, Hunk. We have no more money. And we can't hold any events at our arena until we pass the inspection. But he's like a banana with too many brown spots. Not to be trusted. Don't worry about it, okay? I got this. It takes two to tango. I've seen you dance and that tango comment is not instilling confidence. You just zip it. Nate, what are you doing sitting there? Come on, join the fun. You know my attorney, Milo. Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure. Listen, Nate, we love Russell around here at the WUF. We think he's going to be big. I mean, bigger than big. I want him to have his own line of action toys, lunch boxes. You name it, you're going to see his face right on it. Let the WUF take the monkey off your back! Yoo-hoo, I heard that. I'm right here. Easy, cowboy. So, what's your offer, Mr. Vaughn? Well, in exchange for the use of our WUF brand and to have access to all of our talent... 51 percent. Fifty-one percent? Yeah, that's what I said. It's... It's my final offer. Come on, Nate, use your head. Don't be such a cheeky monkey. Hey, cheeky? What? Do you want a small piece of a big pie, or would you rather have no pie at all? Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I like pie. On two conditions: All the home events take place at the Ferraro arena. Which means that you supply the money to bring the building back up to code. We wouldn't want to burn down the house now, would we? Hey, you're telling me. That nostalgic arena is priceless, isn't it? All right, fine. You got yourself a deal. - Thank you. - Don't do it, Nate. Welcome to the big show! Don't worry. It's just temporary. As soon as we pay him back, this building is ours. Free and clear. Well, Mr. Ferraro. I'm happy to report your arena meets the inspection. Congratulations! Thank you so much, Mrs... Olsen. And it's Thursday night and Ferraro Wrestling has never looked better. Russell Maniac's opponent, the Mongol, looks intimidating, Mike. - You can do it! - Come on, Russ! That's my golden boy right there. Woo-hoo! He rocks the Mongol in the middle of the ring. One! Two, three! He is out! The Mongol has been knocked back into the 14th century. - This dog is unstoppable. - Yeah! I feel bad for Russell's next opponent. He must be terrier-fied. That was great. That was poetry in motion. Even better. I mean you ever tried reading poetry in motion, it gets all jumbled. Either way, you've just turned wrestling into an art form. We've got to name your signature move, kid. We'll call it the "Russell Tussle". Sounds good, Hunk. All right, listen up, Russy, and listen good. Because I'm only going to say this once. I'm... I'm proud of you, kiddo. There, I said it, now let's not get all sentimental here. Thanks, Hunk. How about a hug? No can do. This is business, kid. How about a banana Popsicle? Don't worry, guys. You can follow the whole tour on WU F's YouTube channel, and we'll be back before you know it. In time for my birthday? Are you kidding me? We wouldn't miss that for the world. And what about Easter? Hunk had promised me he'd help me find Easter eggs. You betcha, kid. I'm pretty sure there's an anniversary in there as well. I know. Bring it in. Come here, Russell. Okay, come on, Russell! Let's get this show on the road! Fame and fortune waits for no one. From the ground to profound Like a phoenix... I have to see the Russell Tussle. Can you please do it? Come on, you've got to do it once for us. I need Russell Tussle in my life, baby. Come on! Give me the tussle, baby. Oi! Such heroics, such heroics, heroics The tickets sold, opponents roll' Max, over here. Lena, over here! Look. Hi, Lena. Hi, Max. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Russell. - Hi, Hunk. Hey, don't eat too many eggs. They'll make you very gassy. Trust me. Russell tussle, chic and muscle Maniac, maniac... ' Okay, let me see it. Yes, it's fantastic! Okay, in you go- All right, here I come. Rising like a phoenix Skip the epitaph, have the last laugh -Hahaha -Hahahaha Swaying up with the bound, fought through to be crown Such heroics Yes! Woo! I did it. Opponents roll, the truth be told... ' Look, there they are. - Hey! - Russell. - Sweetie. - Come here. Man, it is good to be back. What happens on the road, stays on the road. I missed you guys. Looks like Mick has the car ready. What? You're going with him? - Yeah. - But Dad, you just got back. You missed my birthday. And the Easter bunny. Honey, this has gotten out of hand. All we ever wanted was to spend more time together as a family, and now, we barely see you or Russell. I... I know, but I'm doing this for you guys. For us. Okay, I promise, just one more match, and we'll retire after Russell wins the title. It's always best to go out on top, right? Come on, hang in there. Please. Nate! - We've got to go. - Mm-hmm. Come on, Russell. Let's go, buddy. Hey, you can leave the monkey. It's just a meet and greet. I'll see you at home soon, okay, Hunk? I had plans anyway. Got to alphabetize my banana collection. Love you guys! Oh, yeah, Nate, I made a little change of plan here. I'm going to hold the title match at the WUF arena. Yeah, yours is too small for an event this size. Our Russell is way too big now. Hey, Nate. Hey, you listening? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Makes sense, Mick. We made it... It was so many... people. There were so... I am so sorry. That took a lot longer than I thought. Everyone wanted a picture with Russell. That's okay. Hunk's been keeping me company. Phew, tag! You're in! Talk about TMI. I am just saying you better have a blue box in your pocket. Thanks, Hunk. And I see you've made my favorite meal. Your grandmother's lasagna. It might be a little cold now, though. Oh. Russell. I missed you too. They wanted to be the waiter and the hostess tonight, but they couldn't stay awake. You're right. Something needs to change. Come with me. Okay. - What is this? - And voila! You had it restored? When? I have my ways, but let me tell you, that is a lot heavier than it looks. Happy anniversary! Welcome to the weigh-in for tonight's championship fight. That's 25 and a half pounds of muscle... - Yeah! - ...for the tenacious terrier. Next up, we are joined by the current champion Helix "The Hammer" Munroe who will be fighting Russell Maniac later tonight. - Oh, wow. - Wow, got a shot. Hammer time. Wow, The Hammer is exactly ten times larger than Russell Maniac! A classic David and Goliath story. Yeah, if David was a dog and Goliath was an ape. How do you see tonight going down? First of all, I'd just like to say you're welcome. To everyone. You're all now better people for having been graced with my gravitas. Well, it's good to have confidence! That I do. And as for how tonight is going to go down? I am going to crush that little flea bag as if he's a bag of fleas that I crush. And how do you respond to that, Russell? This has turned into a staring contest. Neither wrestler will back down. - He blinked! - That's not fair. He cheated. This will be an historic evening for the WUF wrestling. How are you feeling? Good. You got this. You're gonna do great out there. Bad news, you can't be in the ring. Sponsors feel that a monkey and the kid kind of detracts from Russell's tough guy image. So... yeah. - Wait. He's the trainer. - He is the trainer. That's a good one, Nate. Listen, seriously. We're all done with the monkey gimmick. What... What do you want to do? Turn the WUF into a... banana republic? That place exists? - Sounds like Nirvana. - It's not what you think. Listen, Russell's a super star, and that's the way it's going to be. Wait, Nate. Is he trying to push me out? That stupid dog! I will hammer you to the ground with my bare hands. I will hammer... Mr. Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn. Did you see that dog make me look like a monkey in front of all my fans? There's no easy way to say this. Russell's going to take the belt tonight. No questions asked. - What? - That's a question. There's no way I'm giving my belt to Russell. You think I'm the type of guy that's going to take bribe? Nah, maybe not, but... I wrote a number down here for you. Oh, boy. What round do you want me to go down in? Uh, 20 minutes in. No! I knew that dirty rat was up to something. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls welcome to the WU F. My name is Bad Chad coming at you live from the WUF arena! It's time for the main event of the evening. Making his way to the ring, it's the challenger. Nate, I gotta talk to you. Look after the match, okay, Hunk? - But... But Nate... - No, look... Okay, I know you're upset, but it's just one match. We have to focus right now. He's hairier, he's scarier, he's a Terrier! Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Russell Maniac! Russell! Russell! Just listen to that crowd. Go Russell!! Wool! - Come on, Russell! - Yeah, come on! And now, the two-time intercontinental champion and reigning heavy weight champion of the WUF, it's Helix "The Hammer" Munroe! You're welcome, you're welcome. Eye on the prize, Russell! Eye on the prize. You're going to lose, Hammer. Okay, that's weird. I'm going to send you to the pound, Russell. You're out of your league, dog. You're barking up the wrong tree. This is my yard, pooch! And here we go! This is a title match. Keep it clean. No low blows and protect yourself at all times. Shake hands or paws. Come on! Get it off the ring. You got this, Russell. Russell Maniac might be feeling a little nervous. Are you ready for some pain, Russ? Russell, get him! Okay, yeah! Wow! - Russell! - Great job, Russell! This gives new meaning to the phrase: "Hair of the dog that bit me." Hey, Russ, way to go, pal. Who has the gravitas now, baby? Russell! - Russell, he's coming! Russell! - Now you see me. Now you don't! Yeah! The Hammer hits the turnbuckle hard. That's my dog! Oh, yeah! Who's the champ? Who's the champ now? Good job, Russell. Russell! And The Hammer is doing the shaky chicken dance. Did you bring a pillow, because you're about to go nighty night. And there it is, folks! The Russell Tussle! - Yeah, Russell! - And The Hammer gets nailed. That's it. - We got him now, buddy! - You're going down! Hit him, Russ. Hit him. Don't mess around. What is Russell doing? That's right, who is the top dog now? He's giving the Hammer valuable time to recover. Come on, Russell! Quit showboating! Finish the jump off! My ears! - Oh, what's that? - What's that noise? Hey, cheater! Wait! What's wrong with Russell? The Russell Maniac is down and he is not moving. Russell! - No! - What a turn of events! No! - One! - Russell, kick out! Kick out! Come on, Russell, get up. " TWO! " No! No! - Three! - Russell! It's all over! Russell Maniac has been defeated! What? No. The Hammer has struck! - Is he hurt? - What happened? Are you okay, Russell? That's messed up. No! Yes! - Let's go check on him. - Okay. What a stunning main event here at the WUF arena tonight. The WUF Heavy Weight Champion. It's okay, Russ. It is not your fault. He cheated. What do you mean, Hunk? The Hammer used a high-pitched dog whistle to confuse Russell. Hammer time! All right Hammer head, what's going on? You were supposed to throw the fight and let Russell win. Couldn't do it. Couldn't let that dog win. What do you mean you couldn't let the dog win? What about the pay-off? Pay-off? I don't want to be like the rest of the guys that lost to Russell. I mean, sure, they got paid too, but... How's their pride? Not good. Pride? Now, everyone's going to want to see the re-match. - Re-match? - It's just good business. Wait a second. He's right. We could charge the sponsors double what they paid tonight. - Double. - Hey! You got something going on in between those ears. - Way to go Hammer. - That's what I'm talking about. Hammer time! All right, Milo, start working on the papers for that rematch. You mean, it was fake? All of this was fake? You pay them? How could you do this, Dad? No. No, no, Max. It's not what you think. I had no idea. I tried to warn you. No more. We're done. - Excuse me? - You heard me. Where I come from wrestlers win on their own merit. For the love of the sport, not by faking it. And since we've been in business together, I've done nothing but compromise my time with my family. Well, not anymore. I'm not going to have my dog wrestle a cheater. Oh, I get what's going on here. You actually think this dog belongs to you. Oh, naive, Nate. - This dog is mine. - What do you mean? Oh, we got a contract. Yeah, yeah, Russell Maniac and the Ferraro Wrestling Arena are the sole property of Mick Vaughn and the WUF. You sold me? Right there, buddy. Section seven, paragraph six. Section seven? I... I can't... - I can't see a section seven. - Right there. Why you little - sneaky, conniving... - All right! I was sneaky, conniving. It's not my fault that you need glasses. Come on. Wait, no. Russell's a part of our family. Look, kid, Russell is exactly where he belongs right now, with the WU F. Welcome to the big show. - Let's go, gentlemen. - Mick, you can't do this. - Wait, Russell! - Max! Yeah, he's a tough guy. Yeah, you're not part of anybody's family. You belong to me now. Hey, you're a superstar for the WU F, so just get used to it. It's going to be okay, sweetie. It's not going to be okay. Russell's gone. Max, wait! Hold up there, Nate. I'll go talk to Max. I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. I know, but Max is right. Russell is a part of this family. I miss him too, but we've gotta keep it together. Oh, who am I kidding? I miss that little guy so much. - We can't let this happen. - I know. It's not pretty seeing a grown monkey cry. No. We've got to do something about Russell. This just in, Russell Maniac fans: Mick Vaughn has just announced that Russell is now the sole property of the WUF. Max? Hunk? Max and Hunk are gone. Hello. I... I'm Derek from Pet Utopia. Well, guess this is it for me. No friends, no family. Can't even wrestle. I'm a fake. A lonely fraud. Just a crazy dog in a cage talking to himself. - Russell. - Russell. - Come here, boy. Russell - Russell. Russell. Yep, I'm already hearing things. Russell, where are you? Russell. For the love of bananas, it's me. Hunk? Shh! Keep it down. I'm busting you out of this joint. Russell, we're here to take you home. But I let you all down. I'm a phony. Are you kidding me? You didn't let anyone down. You lost one match. And it was rigged. Well, maybe they were all rigged. With Mick, we can't be too sure. But my point is, every great champ loses at least one match. And you know what made them great champs? What they did after they lost. They picked up their pride, dusted it off, ate a bunch of bananas and got back in the ring. But everyone was really disappointed in me. I saw it in their faces. Everyone loves you, Russ. Even me. There, I said it. I love you, kiddo. Keep it together, Hunk. Keep it together. We're on your team, you know? Always. We're family. We all miss you, Russy baby. Come here, Russell. Come here. You know, I just read you need four hugs a day to survive. Eight to really thrive. So what do you say, big guy? Let's hug it out. My stress is melting away. What the... What are we still standing here for? Let's blow this banana stand. - Hey, who's there? - Uh-oh! It's the fuzz! - What are you doing in here? - Do you feel lucky, punk? Drop that stick and reach for the sky, now. Don't hurt me. Max, get his handcuffs and cuff him to that pipe. I can put that one in my new book. - 101 Uses For a Banana. - You're a monkey! Oh, boy, another genius. Let's make like a banana and split. Come on, let's go. Come on, Russell, let's go. Arrivederci. Come on. We're almost there. What? You think you can run from me? That mutt belongs to the WUF. Hey, Nate, yeah, see now I can press charges here. Your son's taking my property. Actually, sir, Russell is not your property. Who's this chump? His name is Derek and he is from Pet Utopia. When I found out Russell was going to be given away to the pound, I adopted him. So as you can see, Mr. Vaughn, Russell is not your property. He's mine. But, Russell needs a family. And he found one in the Ferraros. I've never seen him happier, or braver. I'm handing over custody of Russell to the Ferraro family. You can't do that. He can't do that, can he, Milo? Actually, they can do that. This contract makes ours null and void. Mick, you have zero ownership of the dog. There's something wrong here. Well, I guess that settles that. Well, you walk away now, you still don't own the Ferraro arena. I will evict your family. But I'll make you a deal. I'll give you the arena, if you sign Russell over to me. How's that? A dog for a building. - Forget it. - What? You heard me. Russell is a member of this family. And we are the Ferraros, and family always comes first, not greed. So you can take the building. You're making a big mistake there, Ferraro. You're trying to succeed where your grandfather failed. That's your family legacy. Failure. I've had enough of this cheeseball in a cheap monkey suit. It's all right, Hunk. It's okay. It's not okay. He insulted you. Let me at him. I'll tear him limb from limb. - Your monkey talks! - I know. I know. Apparently, humans are dumbfounded by a talking monkey. Tell you what, Mr. Vaughn, we'll vacate the building by the end of day tomorrow. Have a nice night. But that means no more Ferraro Wrestling. That's our family legacy. We can't lose that. He's right though. We are all family, Russ. Yes, we are a family. And family is a verb. When I met you, Hunk, I was a scared, lonely pup. Afraid of my own shadow. You taught me about courage, hard work, and that everything is a negotiation. I can't just give up now and never know if I was actually a champion. I will do anything for this family. My family. We need a re-match, Hunk. Russell will do battle with The Hammer in a re-match. And this time... it'll be for real. And his coach will be Hunk, the monkey. And if he wins... we get the building and we keep Russell. All right. But if you lose... I get everything. But the match has to take place in the Ferraro arena. Well, we've got one more provision. It's going to be a tag team match. Yes. So Russell's gotta find himself a partner. This is going to be the biggest match in the history of the WUF. - What do you say? - We got a deal. Hey. Yeah. Way to go, kid. He's a smart one. It's wrestling night here at Ferraro arena and I'll tell you, TJ, I... I'm a bit nervous. Yes, and in this next match, our jobs are literally on the line. Are you sure you want to do this, Daddy? I have to show Max. Yeah! That I believe in something more than just money. Yes, you do. Papa Maximiliano, he was right. Fame and fortune comes and goes. But family, family is forever. The very large and incredibly intimidating Dieter Das Mountain. Yodel-ay-hee-hoo. My schnitzel! You go get 'em. - We'll crush them! - You think you're strong enough? - And here comes The Hammer. - It is Hammer time! Hammer time! You're welcome. You're all welcome. The man who once said, and I quote, "String cheese really isn't string. It is just cheese." It's an honor for you to be my presence. It's Hammer time! Now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the one, the only... Russell Maniac! Russell, you're my hero! Russell! Russell! Russell! Russell! Russell! Russell! Russell! Yeah, I like him. In his first match ever, it's Maximiliano Ferraro Junior! He's just a kid! Okay, kids, you got this. Make Maximiliano proud. Let's do this. All right, remember, we can't lose. We're Ferraros. The strongest tag team is family. Okay, we got this. Ladies and gentlemen, this will be a tag team match. I want to see a good clean fight. Both teams ready? We're ready. It's Hammer time. It's time to wrestle! It sounds like they're ready. Oh, boy, Max, I mean, II Maniac, is going to be in the ring first versus Dieter Das Mountain. Now, that is a big decision for team Russell Maniac. Are you ready? I'm going to crush you. Focus, Max. - What? - Come on! Max? Now, you see me, now you don't. Woohoo! - Come on, ref - No. Oh, please. - This is not happening today! - My beautiful eyes. - Not my son. I'll kill you. - Mom, stop. - Hey! - That's Max's mom. - Colleen, get out of the ring! - Mom, I got this! Thought this was a wrestling match. Get out of here. Nate, listen to me. Max has been training for this. He can do it. Mountain, behind you. What? ' Yodel-ay-hee-hoo! - Oh, yeah. - Perfect, Max. - Nice drop, kid! Nice! - Come on! That's it! That is not nice. it could all be over right here, Mike. Max, reverse it. Reverse it! " TWO! " No! My nose hair! Max got out of that one by a hair. Oh, that was close. " Oh! " Oh! Yodel-ay-hee-hoo. - Attaboy, Max. - Way to go, buddy! He's giving him an atomic wedgie. - Oh, that's his underwear! - Yes. I hope he wore a big pair of underwear to work today, TJ. Who turned out the lights? Now I get you back, kid. Wait. It's me, the ref! No, no, no! That's got to hurt. Oh, no! - Please, help me. - Over here, buddy. Max, tag Russell in. - Tag! - Hammer, I can hear you, but I cannot see you. - Please. - What is this? Get out of here. Rock it, buddy. I got a bone to pick with you, Hammer. Come on, Russell! Russell and the Hammer meet once again. Go! What a psych-out by the Russell Maniac. ' Ooh! ' Oh! That was two strikes on The Hammer, Mike. Russell Tussle! Russell treats the Hammer like his dirty laundry. That dirty rat has something up his sleeve. Oh, no. What's he doing? Wait a minute. He's got that thing. It looks like a dog whistle. You thought you could defeat me? Ref, open your eyes. Yeah, smart! Smart thinking. Look what he's doing. This might be all over now. He missed it! Oh, yeah! ' Get up! ' He's okay! Get up! And the Hammer is out cold. Yes, Russell! Woo-hoo! Yeah! One! Two! Three! He's out! It's all over! Russell! They are the new tag team champions! The winner! Yes! - Good job, Russell. - Way to go, Russ! Great job, Russell. You idiot. You let a tiny dog beat you. What's the matter with you? Nobody makes me look like a monkey. You're not the boss of me. - You're out! - You're out! I'm so proud of all of my boys. Wait. Russell can't hear you. That's how you defeated the Hammer? You tricked him? We knew that Hammer would cheat again by using the dog whistle. So, we had a plan. Like I said, guys named Max are always the best guys to have it in your corner. Come here. - I love you, buddy. - Love you, Dad. And you, Hunk... thanks, buddy. That was just like old times. That was more fun than a barrel of monkeys. You get it, Nate? Because I'm a monkey. That's good. - Are you crying, Mike? - Yes. - I am too. It's wonderful. - Oh, yes. Congratulations, guys! After our big win, I got to stay with my family forever. And the Ferraros got back their building. The Ferraro wrestling business was back to its former glory. And Max and I, well, Russell Maniac and ll Maniac became the most famous tag team duo in wrestling history. Proving that the strongest tag team really is family.
