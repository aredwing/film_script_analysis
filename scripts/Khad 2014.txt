Cancer effected Savita Devi knows, That she don't have much time left. that is why She and her son Khokon is going for a holiday trip. Hold my hand. Easy! Easy! sit here Sit there. Take some rest here mother don't know still how much we need to walk Ask them about the plane? What is the time now? ohh! shit. What happened. Sorry mother not only is the watch glass broken, but the watch has stopped. It's showing 12:08 PM which must be the time when the accident happened. I think the driver was drunk Stop it mother.

My watch is not working. 1 :32 PM Ok. Polton can you please come with me. I need my bag Ok lets all stick together. Yes. I will help you, Tewari ji. 1 :32 PM It is 1:32 PM now. TIt will start getting dark by 4:00 PM, so we have 2 hours. What to do? I don't know. We have to find a way out. Where is the Problem? We have 2 hours, we can walk as much as possible. Where do you go by walking? If we walk for 2 hours we can reach somewhere. You will reach nowhere. Do you all have any idea? how far that bus fell down. No! No! what she meant is we cant stay here. Whose is this? We have to find a road. Its mine. Sorry! Sorry! Have you ever been in the Hills? Yes, so many times! For trekking? or by car? Why are you confusing us? Nothing is arranged properly Say it clearly There is no proper road for this 400-500 ft. Am I right? We have to find out the road by trekking. It's not possible in 2 hours. It will take a whole day. Especially in this unknown forest. Lost love or a dead wife is not the reason Rajeev is alone in life. He loves to stay in his own world form childhood. He dont have many friends. He is in Kolkata for only a few days in a year. He loves the hills. So he goes trekking very often. We dont know much about this health conscious Bengali called Rajeev. Don't worry son. Even the Devil does not like me! See, I am still alive even after falling from such a height. Don't talk rubbish. take the medicine Is he alright Yes. Thank you father. He dont speak its hard to understand him. Your mobile is working? No. Wish I could make a call. Shit! Mother she also said shit. She is from Khorda. Now she stays in Crick Row. and she works in a private firm. She can jell with people very fast, has lot of friends. That is why we often see her in high profile dinner parties. Dr. Siddhartha Gupta is a very famous physician of Kolkata. He is so busy with patients and his nursing home.. ..that he almost has no social life. But he has to go to important clients' birthday or anniversary party. What is your name? What did you say the name. Pavan. Pavan Singh. He is a bad guy... he is always drunk. He don't have work. He just picks up the patients from village and take pregnant women to hospital. That's his work But still we should check if he is alive. You have no idea. He very dangerous. Go and check in Gubatan bazaar. He is definitely having roti and tadka there. What do you mean? You have seen lots of accident news in newspapers. have you ever heard that a driver died in an accident. They always come to know first. If they see any trouble they jump off the car. Pavan did the same. What are you saying? Did you see it? What do you think? Am I talking nonsense? He opened the cabin door and jumped off. Disgusting! See we are standing here it's god's gift. Like we are playing extra time Thank god Have seen a tomato falling on a stone. There are few people with whom you inevitably like. Despite all the sadness around they live with a smile. Polton is one of them. That is why he is everybodys friend. He is addicted to smoking, alcohol and cinema. His hero is Mithun This side. Open your mouth. Daughter are you all right? I am fine. was having some headache but now its fine. Good. Mother, I have seen everything, That driver jumped off the car and then the car was on the air But I held on to the rod in front of me. then the car started falling through all the trees Suddenly I hear a sound and I flew out through the front glass and started rolling down. You are making it sound as if it's a fun ride for you. Of course it's a fun ride. It's like a car race in video games. Mother my video game is still in the bus. Dont worry I will buy you a new one from Kolkata From the day when the film actors stared doing stage theatre. ..The theatre stars started losing their fame. He left it long time back. Now just acts in group theatre as a hobby. All the household work is taken care of by his wife. There is a large difference of age between his daughter is Meghna and Son Tito. Mohan Babu is always worried that he has to survive with only his savings for the rest of his life. Other family members are not so concerned about it. That's why maintaining status is the biggest enemy in their life. What are you looking at? Surprising!! abnormal. Nothing to be surprised, my brother doesnt want to talk. In our eyes that is ''Abnormal'' Sorry, I didn't know this. No. How would you know. His brain was damaged during forced delivery. There are many other things to afraid of here, Don't be scared of him. Everybody knows Aparna Banerjee. She does not need an introduction. Apart from acting she is associated some NGO's. Recently in Kolkata She organised a huge rally for medical Check-up of Street Dogs and their adoption. All her personal relationships have been very painful, Perhaps that is why the outcome of love is always different for her. Her only Brother Avik is abnormal. That's why her glamour world stops at her drawing room only. The water is very cold. You want to see? wait. Open your shoe. brother! please open your shoe. Wait. Remember, the water is very cold. Uff! it's too cold. Come don't be scared hold my hand. Sit here. Hey may I ? may ? ! Why are you getting angry? We have so many people here. We will take a suitable decision. Don't talk like a fool. If Rajeev Babu wishes to trek for 10 hours we are not going behind his ass. What are you doing? Honeymoon, in the silent chasm beside river, How do a newly married couple enjoy their honeymoon, by doing tracking. That too with 1214people. Don't be a fool it's an accident. Shut up!! ''Don't be a fool''. Our entire honeymoon is f. What kind language is this? Of course I will do You are a newly married Bengali Bride, don't use this slang. It's possible. You want me to use Sanskrit? Stupid. No no.. You can't talk like this. Please please keep your mouth shut. Please please. F Please. Poonam. I am F I am telling you F.. f Disgusting! .. F.. F.. F.. F.. F.. F.. F.. F.. By seeing them what you can realize its exactly same, They are childhood friends. They are such close friends all the time. They grew up together in every aspect. That's why when they started understanding Love the difference between friend and lover blurred. Actually they never let themselves know or love anyone else. May be their surrounding is not that easy. Now they are trying to grow up as a newly married couple. I think you should give it a second thought I think you should give a second thought No no father this is completely absurd. This does not happen very often Rajeev Babu, I agree with all that you said and that you have lot experience in the hills but I cannot accept your suggestion. Then you can do whatever you want. You can walk. I am not stopping any one. I think what Rajeev Babu is saying Absurd. is it possible father? We can not stay in this chasm with our family. What happened? Rajeev Babu gave a nice idea. To organize a reality show with all of us. You want to participate Mr. Chatterjee. Mother see. No entry fee Let's go. Let me do the odd Job. There is no point arguing. Hello every one! listen to me. Madam please! Would you also listen to me? I don't understand Hindi. Please talk in Bengali. So what I want to say. everybody is not here. Hello everyone! please come here. Hindi teacher of St. Heron School in Kalimpong. He is here since 36 years all the local people also respect him. Tiwari ji knows that he will not be able to adjust in his hometown far from the hills. After retirement he wanted to spend the rest of the life here with his wife. That's why he bought some land near school. He decided to start construction this year. But he had to put that plan on hold due to his wife's illness. God saved us all. But don't be afraid nothing will happen to us. But think what could have happened. There is a transport strike on So no one will know we are here. Forget about rescue teams there is no network in the mobile also. Bye the way what is the time now. 1 :57PM That means the Day light will there for 2-3 hours. See Rajeev Babu is an experienced trekker.

I am not saying that father. I am just talking about manners. Why must men always decide what will happen. Here we have so many girls you could have taken permission from at least one girl.

Petronex medicine company sent me as gift to Dr. Siddhartha Gupta. The Doctor will have fun with me in return he will prescribe the medicine. You bitch. That's it brother slapped his sister and everything is fine now. Not only girls. Medicine Companys gave him money for foreign trips. Fit AC in his house. He held parties in Taj Bengal with hs friends. It's a never ending list. But doctor please prescribe the medicine some times. You cannot blame only doctors. It happens in every profession. But I am very serious about my profession. That's why I am a Successful doctor in Kolkata. I am bachelor, I am not cheating on anybody. Apart from that desire for physical intimacy is natural. Doctor... ..you are right. Profession in not the problem. it's the ethics. It doesn't matter if you are a doctor, engineer, Actor, Author. What a friend we have in Jesus. All our sins and grief to bear. What a privilege to carry everything to god through prayer. Beautiful Mousumi and Sidhartha will start a new beginning from tomorrow. Father can't we all do the same? Sure we can. Everybody start confessing. All the pain, sadness... ..we will leave it in this place and start our journey tomorrow morning. No one will know this ever. If you are willing then call everybody. This is really good father. I will call my mother and Aparna Madam. Call everyone Polton also. Mother we should also participate Father you keep me aside in all this, I don't have anything to confess. I have lost everything. 36 years of relation I could not save Sunita. I have 1 year of my retirement. but I don't feel it from inside. That's why I was going to Kalimpong to resign my job. I have left everything from within me. Now I have only one wish that I could die and might meet my wife again. You will meet, it happens. Your wife is always with you. Its the long relationship and love. When people die the sprit never goes away. They roam around their loved ones. You will definitely meet some day. Where is tito? He is playing in the tent. Ok. Let's make a promise tonight. Whatever secrets we have we will leave in this place.. ..will never look back to that again. Trust me you will feel happy. I respect all of you. You are still there with your Family despite all the trouble. But I didn't that's why I ran away tothe Church. Hello hello over Hello microphone testing 1 2 3 4 over. Hello hello police bus accident over. Hello hello police. ln our family always father, uncle grandfather, grandmother, do the naming of a new born. But I gave myself my name Polton. Our house was just behind the Dam Dim Military camp. My entire childhood sports, practice, 15 Aug., everyone celebrated it there in thecamp. After grew up I wanted to join the military. I gave the exam also. Everything was fine but they rejected me due to my height. India has bad rules. China, Japan, Korea's armymen arenot taller than me. But I didn't leave my dream. I am practicing for the next year. 26th January, I will be there. We didn't came for a holiday. My Mother and father brought me here to convince me to forget Sujoy. Heis belongs to a family lower in class to us. How is our family?. Soptoporni does not mean we are a good family What father does, theater that's all. Our Original house is in Halishahar and it's a very middle class family. Then where is the problem I dragged this middle class family to this place where we are today. Only me. And every one used it. To maintain this economical standard is a crime? Theater maybe very simple for others. but I feel honored that I am a theater artist. Theater is Bengal's pride. My wife Sunita. When she was alive I could not say one thing to her. Sunita where ever you are or if you are listing to me please forgive me. Once I touched a class 8th student in a wrong way. Yes I did it. And I am extremely ashamed of that. We were in south point school from our childhood. We were in love from class 6. It's not physical love because we didn't know what is love at that time. But we realized later and we got married in Kalighat Temple against out family wishes. I have convinced my father. But the main problem is in his house. But we are happy. Poonam came out of her house to marry me. our family have lot of prejudices regarding caste, religion and all. But we don't have any problem. No one talks to her properly in my house. I know but I can't react all the time. But betore I cometo this trip, Before coming here I told my mother that I am not coming back to this house again. I will arrange a 1BHK and settle down somewhere. Poonam doesn't know about it. I thought to tell her during the trip. That's why I told her just now. To be very honest Poonam also has some issues. She gets angry very soon. And the situation gets worse. Don't talk like a fool Jit. If someone pokes me I can't keep quiet. And Poonam doesn't like slang. Never. My name, address nothing is my own father. I can't let out any of my secrets in this place. Sorry. I don't have the right to do that. If I say anything it will create chaos in this country. Only thing that I can say is that I am not justa simple trekker. I am an informer in this border area. I leave the rest to your imagination. It's been 8-9 years since my mother's treatment started. I am tired of traveling from Bangladesh to Kolkata. Kolkata to Bangladesh. Actually, apart from me there is no one to take care for her. My career is almost gone. You can understand that in this kind of a situation. I don't have any personal life or any kind of relaxation. What to do? Duty. mother. Sheis dying and Killing me too. That's all For me my career is everything. I have struggled a lot to reach this place. I can't concentrate at my work if he is alone at home. That's why I am sending him to a Home. I am ashamed of this decision. I know apart from me my brother has no one else. Still. I am a bad sister, a bad human being. I am sorry brother. I am not a singer All that is rubbish. I was a cabaret dancer in Mirza Ghalib Street's, Oscar house. He used to come there every day and sit at table 3. After few days I understood that he comes for me. I always wanted to act that's why I got married to him. He promised me that he will get me a chance but after marriage he didn't do anything for me. But it is ok. he saved me from that hell. l don't have any secret. no no I have one. Since I have got this chance I will leave it here. I was Nafisa Alam. I was pregnant at the time of partition . Ismail sahib died in the riot someone hit him with a stick. Weran away from our houseto another village. At that time Anadi Dutta gave us sanctuary in his house. After listing to everything... ..he changed my nameto Savita and married me as per Hindu Act. Nafisa became Savita. That Savita gave birth to this.. Ismail sahib could not see his son's face. Anadi Dutta was a regular drinker. But his heart was so big. All the bad people divide the country but can they divide a mother. Whats Khokon's religion, What Savita's Religion. Why do you all put pillars and wire and divide lands fools? Will you speak to me? Father, he can't speak. Let him try. Speak. Akash Bani. News reader Tathagoto Ghosh. Breaking News for today.
