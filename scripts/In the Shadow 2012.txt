The State Security Bureau is established as the instrument of Communist power. Everybody is talking about currency devaluation, so-called monetary reform. The Crown is stronger than ever. There will be no monetary reform! Antonn Zpotocky, President. What are you doing? Cut that out! Nothing. Hurry the hell up. There was supposed to be a tin safe here, not a Wertheim. What's wrong? Get lost. IN THE SHADOW Comrade Captain! Boom! Boom! - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. -Should I make up the armchair instead of the bed next time? I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to wake you. What do you want for dinner? - You. -Jarda! - Sausage, then. With mashed potatoes. Tom! Goal. See you this afternoon. OK daddy. - Who called them? - Don't know. -Don't let them go in. Everything's cleaned out. Just like my bank account. Go ahead. I'm finished. Wertheim. Cinderella. Made 1925. - Opened from the front, crude work... - Why do they put that shit inside? Insulation. Ash doesn't burn. Have I forgotten anything? This is where he started drilling. He wanted it to be clean. He probably didn't have enough time. He was in a hurry. -Or? Or he didn't know how... - What's that? - Sweat. He was sweating. Beno, what safecracker sweats like a pig? - Is he a suspect? - Sorry... Janata. He sweats and looks like a pig. A sheath for a knife? You should have a word with Jlek. He's not talking to me. If he keeps acting like a fool I won't be able to keep him. He's an artist. Took pictures in Paris. He even shot de Gaulle. - What's wrong?! - The spark plugs again, captain! A bag for jewels? Or for nails? It's for measuring rice. Alright, lunch is on me. A dead horse, should be buried, not beaten. If anyone says there will be monetary reform, they are beating a dead horse! - What's it going to be? - The pork. How many dumplings? Two's enough. Thanks. Cops. - Fuck. Ow! - What's the rush Karlos? Where do I find Kirsch? I don't know him. You did half a year in Pankrc with him. I did time with lots of guys. I'm clean. - Yeah? - Yeah! You just got a little dirtier, eh? Gambling, sponging. That's three years at least. - Okay, maybe I do remember. - That would be lovely. Got a cigarette? Does Emanuel Kirsch work for the Jewish Community Centre? We know about Mr Kirsch's problems with alcohol... If he has broken something we will pay for it. -Where is he? Kirsch spent two years in Auschwitz. Leave him alone. Would you prefer a house search? Mr Kirsch. Some people from the Police are here. - They only want to talk to you. - May I? Kirsch... it's been years. This is no way to greet an old friend. Opening an old Wertheim like a can of sardines, that's not your style, Kirsch... I haven't done anything. I'm an honest man... Piss-pots hide under the bed, not honest men. - Where were you last night? - Sleeping. I swear. - I lost it in the storeroom. - You used to be more careful. Why don't you ever finish your cigarettes? The captain only smokes the healthy half. Let me have a look. - That's not mine! - Take him away. It's not mine! I swear! Let's go. I was drunk as a pig last night! Ended up in the drunk tank. I swear! You're a striker! Get up there! Go to the middle! Follow the winger! Goal! Nice! Own goal... still counts. - You're spilling it... - Ouch! Sit still, Tom! Why didn't you clean it? - I didn't have a brush. - You want to get blood poisoning! I scored a penalty and dad didn't see it! I saw the goal before. - That was an own goal. - Own goals count too. And some peroxide. Tom! - Open up! Tom! - I don't want peroxide! - You talk to him. - I'd run away too. - Could you act like a dad? - Why? There's peace and quiet. Cut it out, Jarda. You're terrible, both of you. What's wrong? I'm scared. Everybody's talking about the monetary reform. At school, in the building, everywhere. What if we have nowhere to live, nothing to eat? What will we do? Don't forget you married a cop. I'd know about it. - Yesterday the Finance Minister said... - And you believe him. You believe them? I have to get back to the station. I want your advice. The girls at work said it's a good idea to buy stamps. - Why stamps? - They say stamps never lose their value. - You know anything about stamps? - No. What if there is no reform? Get the armchair ready for me so I won't wake you up. PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC, ALCOHOLICS WARD Police. Captain Hakl. POLICE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS - Greetings Comrades. - Greetings. Is Colonel Pnek in? -Yes. Wait. I should tell him you're here. Thank you. Buy The Red Times! Gold Stolen By Jews! Case Solved In One Day! - What are you doing here? - Bare, State Security. We're taking over the Kirsch case. Who let you go through my things? I did. How could you let them search my desk? Major Zenke is a German expert who's been on this case for three years. The Jews are smuggling gold to Berlin. They're helping finance war in Israel. Just last year that Bare guy was working at reception. I know his face. - How could you let this happen! - Times are changing. Stop yelling. This is State Security now, in case you haven't noticed. This isn't some lock-picker. It's politics. - There is one more thing. - And that is? Kirsch. He spent the whole night in the drunk tank. - It wasn't Kirsch. - Who knows this? I do. - I want to interrogate him. - You can't. Kirsch was taken away by State Security. - We can't just leave it to them. - Keep working on it. Don't let anybody know about it. Report only to me. Thanks. The witness is yours. - Sit down. - Thank you. What is your name? On April 5th, 1953 I met Abraham Hbner, Rikl, Bektajn and Bursch to hand over jewels from the jewellery shop on Pechrkova street. Let's go. We don't see any problem. You've got the complete testimony. You know the names. Kirsch's testimony is worthless. I think you know what I'm talking about. We interrogated Kirsch in the standard way. Arrest the leaders of the Jewish Community Centre. What am I supposed to arrest them for? Employing a drunkard? You're right, major. We cannot allow any doubts. There are big changes ahead of us. We cannot afford a single mistake. Not us, not you. - Good evening. - You're in the papers! Do you have a gun now? I would never step in here without one. Why do you keep doing this? Your pockets are all yellow. You want me to quit, don't you? - Good evening, ladies. - Good evening. - Bye, girls. - Bye bye. Come on, Tom. It's dinner time. Pass it here, Tom! - Come on, you two. Let's go, Tom! - Good! Run! Let's see who's first. Run, run. I've got you. I'm going to be first. Thanks so much, inspector. You've got a heart of gold. Your partner brought him over this afternoon. God bless you. Brov was here today. She brought some cognac, saying you arranged a tenant for her. - And that you have a... - Heart of gold. Who is that? A German cop. He was sent to our department. - Why? - I'm gonna kill Beno. Yeah, he brought him over. Jackass. "Get the harpoon," cried the Canadian. Captain Nemo stopped and took one more look out the porthole, beyond which the form of the monstrous creature was writhing. The Nautilus pitched from side to side, caught up in the enormous tentacles of the sea monster. At that moment I knew that only he could defeat the monster. He sealed his diving suit and disappeared into the pressure chamber. Then he brushed his teeth and went to sleep. - It doesn't say that. - It does! -It doesn't. Why not? -He couldn't brush his teeth in a diving suit. You're a better detective than me. - Good night. - Good night. JEWELRY CASE SOLVED - What's going on, Jarda? - What do you mean? You sleep in the armchair. You don't talk. When I touch you it bothers you. You don't find me attractive anymore. Jitka... Come now. Jitka. - What is it? - Someone's out there! Stay here. - Don't you know what time it is? - You said to tell you immediately. Go on then. -Janata lives with some whore by the research institute. - He feeds the dogs there. - Now you're clean. Sorry but this is important. Asta! What do you want? Police. I'm looking for Janata. - I don't know him. - I heard he's looking after the dogs. Like hell he is. He took everything from me and left! - So he doesn't live here anymore? - You heard me, didn't you?! - Have you reported the theft? - Who would care? -Me. I'm listening. I don't want to report anything. I hope it all rots in his pocket, the bastard. I'm glad he's gone. The dogs didn't like him either. - How long did he live here? - Since the coup in '48. His old lady threw him out. - Was he working here? - No. He got everything from me. - Do you shave often? - He left it here. Janata's in big trouble. I can help him. But I guess you really don't care what happens to him anymore. They came for him. Who? - I don't know. - Were they wearing uniforms? -No. - Where is he now? - He never told me anything. I found this. He was always scared of guns. OTTOVA STREE Don't move! Hands up! - Let's go. Go on! - Get the fuck inside! Go! - Where's the money? - Over there. You get your hands up. - Hands up! - Move goddamit! -Ok. - What are you doing?! - They won't notice a goddamn thing. Cut it out for fuck's sake! "Telephone Book." Hands up! Police! Comrade Captain. Who called you? There are four dead... a driver, a postal worker, a security guard and Vilm Foll, known as The Butcher. - State Security will secure the room. - Why? This is a police matter. Major Zenke and Lieutenant Benovsky are police. Have you found anything that might be of help? Did I have enough time? The Red Times! Edmund Hillary Nears World's Highest Mountain! New Soviet Harvester Outclasses All Others! U. S. Pays Its Israeli Murderers! The Red Times! I got a call from Chief of Security. He screamed at me for half an hour. He wanted me to suspend you immediately. Bare made an official complaint about you interfering in a State Security case. We had an agreement you and I. And you got caught. - What were you doing there anyway? - Investigating. -Did you find anything? I didn't have time. They arrived right after I did. I'm supposed to be promoted in two weeks, so be careful. Come in. Am I interrupting? No, come in. I need something from you, Vt'a. Where did you find that? In a telephone book. - Do you have authorization? -No. - Then I can't take it from you. So I'm authorizing it. It's important. I need it fast. Stop by tomorrow. Hi dad! Hi Tom. Good evening. In a week you won't even see it. Did you know Mr Zenke can juggle a football 25 times? That's a lot. How long did you play together? Not too long. He showed up just before you. - Lay down and go to sleep. - We're not going to read tonight? - It's late. Good night, Tom. - Good night. - Do you know he practices every evening? - Everybody here knows that. - Are you looking for something? - Aspirin. - Why? - I have a headache. You never have headaches. Thanks. - Is that blood? - I fell on the stairs. - Wait. Let me see. - It's nothing. -Nothing? It needs stitches. You should go to the doctor. -I'm fine. - Is something going on? - No. -Should I be afraid? Jarda, you know you can tell me the truth. It's complicated. - You're impossible. - Terrible. Terrible. - Now I'm not scared anymore. - That's good. - Good evening. - Good evening. Here you are. - What's in the back? - A collection for the Vienna diaspora. Here's the permit from the Jewish Community. Pull over and turn off the engine. Get out. You can't do this! It's all registered! In the name of the people of the Czechoslovak Republic you're under arrest for attempted murder, robbery and attempt to smuggle money over the Czechoslovak border. Let's go. You did a great job, major. Congratulations. We have a request from Moscow that you testify in court. It was never part of our agreement that I would testify in court. I was asked to prepare materials for the prosecution, and that's what I did. Of course. I've carried out my mission. You should reconsider. I have absolutely nothing to recon... We will decide when your mission is over. One word and tomorrow you'll find yourself on a train to Moscow! - Hide that. - You know what it is? I've forgotten. And you better forget as well. - CZ 52, 7 calibre, Tokarev 62. - So? Only State Security carries this kind of gun. - How many are registered? - Twenty, twenty-five. Could you find out who this bullet belongs to? - I could but it would be complicated. - Do it. They've fired half the people in the building. Everyone's afraid, and you want me to search State Security files? I'm looking for a murderer. I don't care who he is. Sorry. Give it to me. I'm not promising anything. Can I help you? No, thank you. I have to learn how to do it. I like your piano playing. Thank you. I haven't played for a long time. Why not? That's a pity. You play wonderfully. I never had the patience. That's a pity. Sometimes patience pays off. - Now can I help? - Yes, gladly. - Hi, Eva. - Hi. Age 45, 170 cm, ginger hair. No women. Just this guy they brought in yesterday. Yesterday? May I? - Hi daddy. -Hi. - I've almost got it down pat. - And your homework? Is it done? - No. - Get moving then. - Just a little longer. Be home by 7. It's raining anyway. - Hi. - Hi. - Did you see the doctor? - It doesn't hurt anymore. - This is all we had in the bank. - You withdrew everything we had? We're buying a painting. By Slavcek. I've already booked it. There's the number for the gallery owner. Will you call him? Everyone's saying they'll do it! We've been saving this money for Tom! I won't let them take it. Are you going somewhere? Pnek is having a party. He's been promoted. - I'm cooking. Why didn't you tell me? - Sorry, I forgot. - Let me give you a clean shirt. - That's sweet of you. I met that German colleague of yours down in the laundry room. Yes? He's quite nice. Would you like to invite him for dinner? One night we might. - He's a complete stranger. - You know nothing about him. Maybe more than I'd like to. I think Mr Zenke is a decent man. Brov thinks so too. And Tom likes him. You don't know what you're talking about. How should I when you never tell me anything? -He's a liar. - At least he talks to me. - So you talk together? He's a Nazi, Jitka. He's SS. WE DON'T ASK FOR PEACE WE FIGHT FOR PEACE Sorry to hear you've been called off the case. Don't worry about it. - How have you been doing? - Alright. - How about Major Zenke? - He's doing his best. - Today he closed the post office case. - Did he? -Yeah. And who killed those people? Janata. Janata, I see. They found him under a bridge. He was run over by a train. He had a machine gun on him, the same one used at the post office. He and Foll were hired by the Jewish Community Centre. Something about that strange to you? - Jarda. - Congratulations on your promotion. - Thank you. - Can I talk to you for a moment? Of course. What's up? I wanted to introduce you to Colonel Morozovov from Moscow. - Is that necessary? - It's an order. I'd like to testify in court. About Kirsch. I can try, but I doubt they'll allow it. Thank you. - Thanks. - Congratulations. -Thank you. Comrade Colonel, allow me to introduce you to Comrade Captain Hakl. Comrade Colonel Morozov. Here you are, gentlemen. Thank you. Cheers. Comrade Colonel, congratulations on your promotion. Thank you. Why are you doing this? Excuse me? Why are you doing this? I don't know what you're talking about, captain. I'm talking about Kirsch. Kirsch has confessed. He confessed but he didn't do it. And you know it. make any difference to you, does it? What are you waiting for? You weren't so scared yesterday. Or aren't you any good one on one? You're talking nonsense. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. You have a fine family. You should take better care of them. Sometimes, things are not the way they look. Leave me alone. The Minister of Finance had this to say: There will be no monatery reform. It will not happen. Those who say so are liars. They talk so much about not doing it that it's strange, don't you think? We'll just put some plaster on it. Come in. Nice place you've got here. You can sleep in my bed. I'll sleep in the armchair. I'm used to it. Do you have anything to drink? I'll stop by the neighbour's. Dammit. STATE SECURITY SERVICE ID I was out of matches. I said my boss was here and he gave me an old bottle of pear brandy. Here you are. What do we drink to? To life. To life. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. - Hi. Hello. I'm looking for Mr Hakl. - Jarda isn't home. - I need to speak with him. Can I leave him a message? - Fine. You can count on it. - Thank you. -Goodbye. I AM A ZIONIST. I STOLE CLOTH FOR AMERICAN UNIFORMS. Tom! I forgot the tests at home. Can you go on your own, honey? - Hello. - Hello. - I'll take these... - Daffodils. And how many? Maybe five? Two crowns. - Nice choice. - Thanks. -Thank you. Captain, Jitka was taken to the hospital by ambulance. - What happened? - A robber hit her. There was a lot of blood. Captain, think of your family. Good afternoon, Comrade Captain. I took this case myself. I'm sorry, Jarda. - How is she? - Hopefully she'll be fine. Has anyone you sent to jail gotten out recently? - I don't know... maybe. - They didn't steal it. Well... you know the procedure. Find out what's missing. The prosecution rejected you testifying in court. They only want Zenke to represent the police. There was nothing more I could do. Vt'a from ballistics called. He wouldn't leave a message. Thanks. I need something from you. GALLERY OWNER Hakl here. Give me Vt'a Novk, ballistics. When did he leave? Again! Dad, why do they keep turning it off? Maybe they want us to be afraid. I'm not afraid of anything. Like you! - Really? - Yeah! That's good. Damn... Tom, clean the table. - Bon appetite. - Bon appetite. Good. Not really. When mum gets out of the hospital she'll roast us a chicken. What happened to you? - I got in a fight. - You won't let me get in fights. Well now I will... but you have to know why you're fighting. And did you win? - Do you want to learn to fight? - Yeah. But mum'll be angry. Then it'll be our secret. Come on then. Basic stance. With your left you go for the head, then a right hook to the belly. Go. Wait here, Tom. What are you doing here? -Captain Hakl. I'm looking for Vt'a Novk. He took a few days off. I'm filling in. Can I help you? Tom! - What's up, dad? - We have to go now. It's nothing important. I'll drop in some other time. He was here. HAKL, 23 BILKOVA STREE Dad, where are we going now? Home, Tom. We've got to go home. Tom! Dad! Do you want to lose your kid or what? Who are you? Who sent you? What's all this about? - Are you insane? - Daddy, I'm scared. Sorry. Forgive me. You can go. Tom, come on. Tom, nothing happened. Everything is fine. You don't have to worry about anything. Is that clear? Come on then. What are you looking for, dad? Was there anybody looking for me yesterday? -No. Tom... It's important. Try to remember. Well, mum talked to a man down in the courtyard. And what did he look like? Was he wearing glasses? He was. Can I recite that poem for you now since mum is not here? - You can. - But you have to correct me. The Kulak. Listen people, what happened yesterday near Prague, in a place called Lhota. A poor kulak - can you imagine - was hiding millions in his shoe. He hid them there for many years, waiting for the regime to end, looking forward to a happy future, eager to multiply his money. Now he is facing catastrophe. He was never used to having to work. Now tell me, how shall poor kulaks make their living? Did I do it good, dad? Dad! Good. Very good. After reading the charges the judge will ask you to read the conclusions of your investigation. The interpreter will be standing right behind you. You will say what you're supposed to say then you'll go back and sit down. And then? You've got more friends than we thought. Bonn accepted a swap. You'll get your passport from the driver. At 5:00pm you cross the border. Let's get going. The journalists are expecting us in ten minutes. What are you doing? -You're going to your grandma's for a few days. - I don't want to. - Mrs. Brov will take you. -Dad. I'm not going to discuss it. Lay down. And sleep. You don't like us anymore, do you? What are you saying? Tom! There is no one I love more than you and your mum. No one. Then why do I have to go to grandma's? Because mama is in the hospital and I have a lot of work. Are you going to fight again? Remember when we read about the giant squid that no one could defeat? There's a monster like that I have to fight now. Even though it can't be killed? If we keep fighting it all the time, it's going to get tired and weak. And maybe one day somebody will defeat it. Who? Somebody. Maybe you. Good night. I'm sorry about your wife. What did they promise you to get you to lie tomorrow? This is my wife, and my daughter. In 1944 she left with the child for Bavaria to live with her mother. At the end of the war I was captured by the Russians, and they sent me to Siberia. You have no idea what it's like, 8 years' imprisonment. I only know my daughter from photos. And now I will see them. You want me to believe that? You can believe whatever you want. You knew all the time that I found the bullet in the post office. You could have turned me in. - Yes, I could have. - Why didn't you? Sometimes, things are not the way they look. Here is the name of the the post office murderer. You are going to testify in court. You can read it in as evidence. You'll save the lives of five innocent Jews. No one can save them now. - We both know that. - This is the evidence. Do you think they're going to let you go? They will. They'll swap me. What do you think will happen if I read this out? Will it change anything? There is no justice, captain. - I'm going to call the prosecutor. - Don't do it. They will ruin you, just the way they've ruined me. Think of Tom. What about his future? What good is a father who's afraid? And what good is a father who's dead? If it were up to me, I'd send you back to Siberia. Not home. Don't forget. Everything that happens in this court is delayed one minute before being broadcast. - Do you understand that? - Of course. Where the counter-revolutionary group "The Community" is about to be tried. This group has committed armed robberies and sabotage in our country in order to support Zionist terrorists and US agressors. In the name of the people and the state, the members of this group will be tried: Abraham Hbner, Otto Bektajn, Eli Lintok, Karel Rikl, Ester Kleinov and Emanuel Kirsch. Their confessions are conclusive proof that, with the money of our workers, they wanted to support the unjust fight of Zionist separatists in Palestine. My function and conscience force me to demand the most severe punishment for them all: The Death Penalty! Did someone just come in here? There's always someone coming in here. I will now call the representative of the police to the stand. Comrade Major, what can you tell us about this case? For a year, I have worked intensively on uncovering and apprehending a Europe-wide criminal gang of Zionists supporting terrorism in the Near East. One trail led me to Bohemia. I was able to uncover a group of subversives organising armed robberies. The group belongs to an international network organised from the USA. The defendants have confessed. In my opinion, they are guilty. Is there anything you would like to add, Comrade Major? No. Thank you. The accused will rise. Do you plead guilty to the crimes you have been accused of? Guilty. Guilty. - Guilty. - Guilty. - Guilty. - Guilty. Guilty. The court will now adjourn for deliberation. At ten o'clock tomorrow, the verdict will be read. - Cheers. - Cheers. Excuse me, I'm sorry. What? -Comrade Captain Hakl is waiting for you. Excuse me for a moment. Jarda. What are you doing here? I'm at work. Does that surprise you? No, not at all. I'm glad to see you again. I know the name of the post office murderer. Janata. Janata never even shot an airgun. Why would he do that? For money. He was hired by the Jewish Community Centre. They've all confessed. And it's over now. No. Janata was hired by somebody else. Janata is a victim. Just like Kirsch. And just like all the others. Do you have any evidence? The bullet from the post office and a ballistics report. The name of the owner of the gun is also there. And the names of everyone who took part in this. What do you want to do with it now? Arrest the murderer. I am arresting you on legitimate suspicion of murder. You're the best I ever had in this department. I'll give this to the state prosecutor. Who do you think sent those guys this morning? - Did you send them to hurt Jitka too? - I had to. It was your fault. Where is that bullet? When they order you to kill your mother, will you do it? - Where is that bullet? - Will you throw her off a bridge too? Don't you realise this is exactly what they want us to do? Where's that fucking bullet, you son of a bitch? Now it's safe. Yes? The swap has been made. Sooner or later a murder will be nothing but a murder again. Call the prosecutor immediately. We have to stop the trial. You are going to have to explain this to Moscow, Comrade Colonel. Mommy... He gave me an order. Monetary Reform! No Need For Panic! Plenty Of New Bank Notes! Bread Now Cheaper For Everyone! Dynamo Prague Beats Spartak Stalingrad 3:0! Now they've done it! Those bastards have gone and done it! It's a disgrace! Those Bolshevik thieves stole it all! - Get it! Take his bag! - Give it to me. - Stop crying. - They took my bag. Tom? Tom? This film is dedicated to the victims of the 1950s Communist Show Trials and to all the unknown heroes who have fought against injustice.
