Yet! -You're a sore loser! -Cheater! It turns me on when you bitch. -It does? -Yeah. It makes me hot. Does it? Come on! In your dreams! And? You rule! Not bad, huh? Yup. -Can we go? -Theo, at half past, you know. But it's boring! I know, but I told you. In life... I know, we can't always do... what we want, even if it's not fair. Exactly. Anyway, I'm almost done. Does she have to stay much longer? I don't know. How 'bout it? Try a new record? Talking to yourself? Or did you bring your kid again? I answered the gyprock. It asked me for a joint. If my insurance busts me cause of you, you're out! No sweat. I'm alone, it's safe. -I'm watching you. -Cool. -I'm warning you. -It's all good. Can I sit in front? No! Please? Pretty please? Come on! O.K., but just for today. Yes! I promise I won't tell Mom! -Hope to die? -Hope to die if I tell a lie! Now buckle up. Why do sick people get flowers? Cause flowers are like life. It helps them get better. Then why do dead people get them? To show we love them. Flowers are like love. Are they life or love? Same thing. -You have to water love or it wilts. -You're a smart kid. Mom? A heart attack? Why didn't you call me? We just got her stabilized. How is she? She's on morphine. She's not strong enough to waken. She's very fragile. She's been waiting for months. When will she be first in line? Even then it can take a long time. She can't stay like this. How long? A few days. A few days. No way! You have to do something. Without a donor, there's nothing I can do. Is there anything I can do? What can I do? Tell me. Anything. Try praying. No. No, look... Try it. Maybe someone somewhere can save your wife. She won't really die, will she? No. She won't die. We'll do anything to save her. You won't let her die? No, we won't let her die. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. Hope to die? If I tell a lie! Promise me. I promise. Ready or not, here I come! Julien? Theo? I'm going to find you! Julien? Theo? We'll set sail on a big ship And drop anchor on a treasure island Where those funny birds nest That you see In your dreams Everything's fine, angel. I'll take you home. Hang on! ORGAN TRANSPLANT DEPARTMEN Shit! You snuck past security again? I told you not to! Theo, how are you, dude? Check this out! Cool, huh? Brand new! Have fun. Go play. Scat! The news is bad, so be nice to me. Sorry. Nothing new, except a kidney. Don't give up. She's next. The first heart, it's hers. She's been waiting months. Yeah. It's a long weekend. With luck some crazy driver will ram a brick wall. Sorry... So, Theo, like my car? Yeah. Open the trunk. Cool, huh? Yeah. Come on, with all the people who die in hospital here, there's gotta be a heart. There are, but procedure fucks things up. Procedure? O.K., but keep your mouth shut. Why no organs? Cause no one donates? No. Cause doctors aren't paid for that. Take a surgeon... He gets $20,000 to cut you up into pieces. But the doc who spends the night keeping a coma victim alive, he doesn't get a cent more. There's no bonus. We have organs, but no cash. That's disgusting. Expect me to take on the system by myself? No. All I can do is place the organs I get. I can't save the world. What if I get a heart? Yeah, right. No, think about it. In theory you could say, I dunno... some American got shot in the face while hanging with his pals. I can put what I want, I fill out the forms. But Mr Wiseguy, where'll you get a heart? I dunno. Some bastard who doesn't deserve his. You're joking, right, Robin Hood? We save criminals and let the innocent die. We should pay to save the innocent. Off the record.... Pay... pay how much? Wouldn't you like a real car like that? In real life that's worth 50 grand. That's expensive. Life's expensive. Can we make a deal? Sure, we can always make a deal. Look, that's how it is. You're wrong. We can change things. -Look after Theo. -Don 't say that. You'll look after Theo. We'll look after him together. I promise. Who cares? That pickup was a gas-guzzler. Yeah, tell me about it. And it polluted. It polluted. So are we cool? We're cool. It was just a car. You'll see, Grandpa has lots more. Good to see you, big guy. You keep growing! -Is it true you have lots of cars? -Come see. -Do they go fast? -And how! Nowadays it's always more. More gas, more power, more cash... Everything's got so complicated. It won't be long till we're replaced by machines. That's what their technology's about. Know what they really want? To dumb us down. Cause... imbeciles never revolt. Imbeciles obey the dictates of the market. The dictates of the market, you hear? I read you. Watch out, they're everywhere. Sooner or later they'll get you too. Sure, there are some benefits. But that won't last. Kids today are lost. Nowadays you need a degree in computing to be a mechanic. It's friggin' insane. We'll be robots. We're slaves now. We'll be pawns on their chessboard. Pawns, you hear? Look, I'm not in the mood to save the world today. Of course not, sorry. This is the one we fixed up. You'll be proud of us. -Super. -Way cool. It's wicked! I hear white flames are hot. Yeah! -What's underneath? -A 16-valve. You'll love it. Have a look. Forged rods, a short block with oversized valves. It's chipped, it's got a super charge. With the nitro, you'll be strapped to a rocket on wheels. Just don't lift off, cause you'll fly! It's cool. But... It's perfect, thanks. I don't know how I'll pay you back. Why? Come on, a son never owes his dad nothing! I'd never have asked you if it wasn't an emergency. Look, kid... I'm glad that you need me. I've always tried to help you in my own way. My way may not be yours, but... You understand? I always tried. Thanks a lot, Dad. It's great. Do you have that address? That address... Where the kids are racing tonight. -Dad, look, nitro! -Move. Don't touch anything. This is the place you want. Careful, you haven't raced in a while. Don't tempt the devil, he's hungry. Thanks for taking Theo a few nights. We'll have fun. We'll race go-karts. Go-karts, cool! -We'll see if you're as fast as Max. -Julien. Right, Julien. Start her up. Wait till you hear her purr. Not bad, huh? Who're you? It's a private party. For the cover charge... and a few drinks. O.K. Follow me. I dunno if you know, it's $2000 a race. -You in? -It's all good. -Watch this, I'll pay you $50 a race. -$200. Get me races. I'll trust you with my cash. I'll pay you $100 a race. O.K. Billy! Billy! Billy! That's Max. The champ. He crashed and dropped outta sight. Thank you. That's your wad. Well, you see, nobody else wants to bet. What? By the way, I'm Fanfreluche. I'll bet 5 on the next race. Let's go! Sorry, I'm not sure I can get 5. Shit! What is this? Nobody wants to bet? Why'd you buy those cars? Is this a fashion show or a duel? Are you pilots or wimps? Next race, 5 grand. 5 thou! I'll give $10 grand to anyone who beats me. Any takers? -Yo! -What? Haven't you had enough? Lay off. Tired of me already? Get me a can of nitro. Not now! O.K., hand over the cash. Max! That's your name, isn't it? Who asked you? Gimme the cash. Just a minute. She's not the boss here. That money belongs to us. I won that money, go screw yourself! Don't you feel lonely in your film? Who do you think you are, Mad Max? Come on, he hasn't got a chance. Exactly, so beat it before we get angry. Anyone else? Who's next? Gimme my cash! My cash! Give him his money! Here it is. You're sick! You O.K., Max? Julien, Dad. My name's Julien. You named me that, remember? Yeah, it's true. I just can't get used to it. Anyway, your mom chose that name, not me. You won, huh? You get what you want? Not quite. How much you missing? How much? I've sold everything. I can't even pay the rent. I have to find a solution. I got no choice, I need the money. You and Theo can stay here. Nothing would make me happier. I won't let her die, Dad. I know you understand. O.K., I'll lend you the 10 grand. I can't. I don't know how I can repay you. Forget it! Anyway, it'll all come to you. How much do you need in all? What stunt you gonna pull now, Max? Julien, Dad. You've pulled your share of stunts lately too. Jeez, Max! I can't lose her. I don't want Theo to lose her. We're not at the wheel. It's not for us to decide. Nobody decides for us, Dad. Alice doesn't deserve to die. Your mom didn't deserve to die either. But that's life. Life's goddamn unfair. Haven't you noticed? Christ, boy! Don't do anything crazy. Wait. For what? For her to die? Julien! Do I know you? No. I'm Alice. Glad to see you open your eyes. I've been watching you sleep here for a week. My heart's weak. I figured that if you died, maybe I'd die too. Dumb to be so superstitious. But... I'm not superstitious. It's unlucky. You're funny! Come in! So, what's new? I usually ask you that. Sorry, still no heart. What about you? Here. It's all there. -It'll be legit? -Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Be careful, I don't want to be fingered. I have more at stake. It's a private club. We're closing. Scram. I wanna see the boss. The lawyer. After you. Who're you? Have we met? In another life, maybe. Hold on, I never forget a face. Mad Max. Some babe. You know her well. She's not bad. Me, I think she's a firecracker! She's not a firecracker she's a bombshell. I like bombshells. Maybe I'll blast her. Don't you get it? -Is there a problem? -We're cool. Guy just doesn't know who I am. -Yeah, who? -The lawyer here. So watch out! C'mere, you punk! Stop, I get... -Teach bigshot a lesson! -I get it! -Show him! -Stop, I understand! Look at me, you punk! Stop, I'm sorry! If you busted my nose, I'll ice you. Listen up. In life, big fish eat little fish. Understand? Don't ever let me see your ugly face again. I never forget a face. I get it! You got guts. No, listen. This is business, nothing personal. What you want? Blow, crack, ecstasy? Crystal? Everybody's into that now. A heart. Pardon? I want a heart. You working for someone? I need it fast. Today or tomorrow. I'm in a rush. -Want some water? -No. Water is life, man. Did you know that? Whoever controls water, controls life. Water's health. It's important to stay healthy. Gimme 48 hours and 1 50 grand. -1 00 grand. -125. -100. -1 10, it's a steal. Besides, it's enough. Who says you're not a stool? No one. O.K., 100 it is. You've got balls. Good. -Pay up tomorrow. -Hold on! Who guarantees it's done by a pro? We're all pro's. Nobody's ever complained about our service. I mean, for the operation. We always use the same guy. You'll have a lovely new heart. Just tell me the victim's blood type... I mean, the patient's... Leave the rest to us. -The blood type? -Don't you know it? We absolutely need the blood type. What a fuckin' loser! Wait, it'll come to me. Not everybody knows theirs. These days it's safer. Cause of transfusions. Do you know your blood type? Do you? I'm O neg. I'm the rarest, AB positive. I'm B pos. A pos. Anybody moves, I'll shoot'em. You sit still, this is fatal. O.K., come with me. I'm staying put, O.K., man? Come or I'll shoot him. One! Two! It's O.K., Gino. Go with him. Get over there! Anybody moves, I'll shoot. Get up! On your feet, I said. Anybody moves, I'll shoot'em! What the fuck? Get going! Stay there! In the front. Leave Gino here! What now, boss? Stay calm. Got his license plate? We'll find him. Clear everyone out. -Name? -Gino. -Where's the doc? -Who? The doc who does your operations. -I don't know. -You're expendable, man! -What's the address? -6000 Frenette. Don't jerk me around! VETERINARY HOSPITAL Mr N'Diaye, there's smoke coming from your veterinary clinic. I'm fire chief Tremblay. You better get over here. Fine, we'll be waiting. The good news is, there's no fire, right? "Stay calm, no matter what," I always say. Do we agree? I don't want trouble either. Good. This way. You're sure you can do this? No problem, really. I was a surgeon in my country. They told me Canada needed specialists. But you don't recognize our degrees. So I became a veterinarian. But I work under the table to pay my taxes and my student loan. Alright. What do you need? His heart. ECG 719. I don't care, I need it now! Understand? Thank you. Bye. Fuckin' cop won't work on the weekend! Goddamn bureaucrat! To think he's paid with our taxes! You're gonna save a life. Fuck you! Why're you doing this? You can repay your debt to society. -I'm innocent. -Sure. You're a bunch of choir boys! I'm innocent. I don't even know you! -Can't you give him a shot? -Why me? Don't kill me. I never hurt you. Or anyone! You don't deserve a heart. For once there'll be justice. Wait! You're making a big mistake. A huge mistake. I'm not a criminal. -What, you're a businessman? -I'm a cop. Sure, and I'm with Candid Camera. You're lying! I swear, man! My name's Steve Santini! -You don't deserve to live. -I swear! Not one second! Hurry up, give him his shot! Have pity, man! My wife! I have a wife, a baby! You killed and raped to be part of that gang of scum. So shut up! I never killed anyone, man! Never! And the H you sell to kids? And the 13-year-olds who turn $10 tricks to buy crack! -Come on, give him the shot! -Done. Do something, save me! Our hell's angel prays to God! It's almost funny. What now, boss? We wait. That bastard is bound to call. He must think we'll buy Gino back. What if he's a maniac? What if he's hacking him to pieces, just for fun? His heart! He's cooled down enough. You'll kill him. I'm a doctor, a healer, not a killer. Killing me won't help. Two corpses won't help you save anyone. You want to kill to save a life, do it. I won't assume that responsibility for you. What do I do? Cut. Here. Think it over, you don't look like a murderer. Hurry up! Sit down, you don't look well. We believe an organ bears part of its owner. Along with it you get some of him. What did they say? They said... They said it would be a miracle if I didn't limp. Miracles only happen if you believe. I guess. You'll be fine. There's a reason it happened to you. Oh yeah? And why your heart keeps growing? I don't know, probably. There has to be a reason for our suffering. What? Even if we can't understand. And chance? No such thing. Prove it. Prove there's no such thing as chance? That's what you said. Take the sun and the moon. Isn't it amazing that from here they both look the same size? One's huge, millions of kilometers away. The other's tiny, a few thousand from here. Think that's a coincidence? I never thought about it. Anyway, what's the point? It's simple. You have the sun and the moon. Sometimes they get closer and closer. When they come together, it makes an eclipse. Perverts! Doing it in public! That's why they put out the lights. Let me show you something. It's amazing. That's your kid? His name's Theo. Handsome, isn't he? Can I say No? That little thing nearly killed you? Did you know? You knew and you had him? I don't mind dying for a reason. You're a strange girl. Thanks. And his dad? Where's his dad? He doesn't know. So you said, I'll make an orphan, no mom or dad. He'll do fine without me. They'll find healthy parents who'll love him all their lives. But you matter too. I'm alone, I can die any time. No, I'm not important. I'm sure you matter for him. For me too, you matter. You're sweet. Julien, give me the baby seat! Light as a feather. Look, check it out. Nice, huh? Is that your car? Not yet. What did I say? Alice! Wait! Stop it! Alice, stop! Wait up! Careful, there's a car. I was joking, I wasn't going to steal it. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... I wasn't really going to steal it. I'm sorry. Look, give me a chance. We all deserve a chance. Your last chance. Wake up. They're coming. Help me. You have to hurry. And keep the heart on ice. Thank you! No, go out the front. Her life's in your hands now. Good luck! Let's go! Catch him! Hello, boss? -Are the cops there? -Yeah. -You nab him? -Not yet. It won 't be long. He'll pay for what he did to Gino. Not just that. The punk deserved to die long ago. You're too kind, boss. Call me. On the roof. The north side. -Hi, Morgane? -Who is it? It's Max. Look, it's not a good time. I'm working, I'm really busy. Morgane, it's really urgent. Is your patio door open? Call back in 9 or 1 0 years. -Morgane, is the door open? -I dunno. -Working hard! -What the fuck? What is this? Get out! What is this? Did you see...? That way! That way! Catch him! -Sorry! -That way. Don't be scared. Sorry, I have indigestion. Close the door! You bastard! I'll drown you! What's going on? -Explain. -I need help. -Some nerve! -Can I borrow a car? What are you getting me into? Why'd you do it? Now you can't come see me at work. I don't give a fuck. I hate that club. Bunch of gangsters. Morgane, why do you...? You're better than that. I can't just quit. I need the cash. It pays real well. I won't do it forever. You always say that, but you're still... I don't steal cars with my dad. I have to earn a living. It's no way to make a living, with your ass! Why do you care? It's my ass! I do what I want with my ass. Got a problem with that? You can sell your ass to those gangsters. -Screw you! -Screw you! I'm glad you have the same place. You fixed it up. Here. So, you still dancing? Those days are over. What do you do? By the tub. Hurry up! IN THE FAST LANE Not bad. Here, catch. A friend forgot it. So you're racing Pro Stock? I didn't run off and leave everyone. I chased my dream. You kept it? Didn't know I had it. We're wasting time. Is that yours? Not bad. Gimme the keys. The other one. -Cool, that'll do. -Where we going? You're not coming, it's too dangerous. Take me for an idiot? I'd never see my car again. Morgane, I've changed. I'll bring it back, I swear. You're a thief and a liar and I'll never trust you again. Stop! The cops are everywhere. Shit! Did you break out of jail? No, not exactly. What's in the bag? Nothing. The less you know, the better. Think you're hot shit. You disappear for 9 years, break in, make me an accessory, ask for my car, and won't talk. Think I'm your wife? Back up, they'll see you. I didn't ask for this. It's their fault. You haven't changed, shit. An irresponsible teen and friggin' macho! And you've changed? So gentle and empathetic! Bloody pighead! Morgane, shut the door! Stop! Morgane! Lookin' for him? Stop, it's not funny! Don't be an idiot! I'd lost them. Happy now? Slow down, you'll get us killed! Stop bossing me, this is fun! What's in the bag? A heart. A heart? -You got one? -What kind of heart? An A pos heart. Christ, Rambo. Floor it! Is it their heart? I'll go it alone. No way, I'm not letting you disappear again. Get off my case! We had a fling, it was lots of fun, but that's all it was. Outta the way! -I didn't know what love was. -Now you do? Yeah, love's called Alice. The heart's for her. Watch out! -What? -Nothing, thanks. Bye. Wuss! Drama queen! Fuck, the heart! C'mon, hurry! Morgane? -You O.K.? -Jump in! Chasing after me now? -Forgot my heart. -I'll eat it! Move! Yeah, speaking. It's for Alice in Wonderland? Something like that. Glad to see you. What are you waiting for? Go! I owe you. A lot! I know. He must be somewhere in the hospital. Where does he go for coffee? I don't know what to tell you. It must be a union meeting. Is there a message? I already left one. I'll go look myself. -They're innocent. -And the body? That punk killed him. The car's not in their name. You've no proof. -They had guns. -And licenses. They were driving recklessly. Yes, and the driver will pay a fine. Do I have to call your chief? That's him! Stop him! Coming through! What are you doing here? C'mon! It's Julien. You? -I have the heart. -Stay away. They found a cop with no organs. -Sure he's a cop? -Who is that? We even know his name, Steve Santini. Steve Santini. -You know him? -Don't think so. -You do know him! -I don 't. Some people want to speak to you. Shit! Look, I'll meet you. Where? The South Shore. -Why there? -It's safer. Take route 30 west to exit 83. Drive around the block. Pardon? Drive around the block! I'll wait at the tracks. -See you in two hours. -Fine. Wait! Wait! There's a T-Rex outside with the keys. I want my T -Rex, shit! Got it. Bye. It's too dangerous. Go home. Are you crazy? This is fun. You enjoy hiding from the cops under a rig, I don't. Why was the lawyer there? I dunno, you tell me. I didn't do anything. Right, we're both clean as snow. What's your problem? Are you losing it? Whose heart is that? The cop's? -Answer me! -Leave me alone! Fuck, you don't have the guts. Answer! Morgane, I have the cops and bikers on my tail. I'm trying to save the woman I love. I don't give a fuck about anything else? Understand? Fuck! No guns in here! No guns! She's here too? -Drop your gun. -No, you! -Drop it! -You're out of your league. Come. You'll tell the cops you killed Gino. You killed someone? Be glad, he was a cop. You killed a cop? Gino was a cop? Are you shitting me? You outta your mind? I didn't know. I don't believe it. You stole'em! -A stool's organs! -His heart. -And the rest? -Your vet probably kept'em. You gutted a pig. Talk about dumb. I'll shoot. No you won't, I can see it in your eyes. Get out of my taxi! Fuck you! Put it down. You vanished for him? For this loser? Some life, bravo! You'll go far! Montreal quiet city, they say. -You O.K.? -Yeah, go! -To the cops? -No, route 30. Get down! What are the odds of choosing a cop? I wanted to rid society of a gangster! Cop or crook, what's the diff? You killed him. You really are losing it. I have to save Alice. -You'd go to jail? -I'd give her my heart if I was A pos. You're warped. That's not love, that's insanity. Giving your life's not love? No, it's egotism. Think your sacrifice will make you better? You O.K.? You alright? -Are you...? -It's O.K., go on! What's wrong, are you having spasms? Just tell me, it's alright. We can stop for now. I'd like to die like this in your arms. Don't say that. Don't say that. All that matters is you're going to hospital. What's the point? You know how it'll end. I'll be hooked up to a machine till I'm a vegetable. I'm not sure I want that. I don't want to lose you. I don't want you to die. Do you want to spend your life tending a sick woman who can't even make love to you? It's crazy. Look at you. Are you happy? Answer me honestly... I can't believe you're asking me that. You know I love you. You know I love Theo. You two are all my life. I know you love me. But do you love yourself? Really? You have a kid? What's his name? Theo. He's nine. I don't believe it! He's not mine, but it's like he was. You disappoint me, Max. Yeah, why? You found a weak woman and a kid so you can play the hero and sit on your ass. Where's your passion? Your life's boring. What? My life's boring? Fucking boring. You're hard. Shit! Been a while since I was here. Remember when we saw Mad Max? What do you watch now, cartoons? Family life is fun, y'know. Some cartoons aren't bad. I can't be hearing right. You used to say that love's... a prison with bars made of flesh. I said that? I was a poet. For real. What are you doing? Waiting for the organ guy. You can go. How long can you keep a heart? Can I see it? No, it'll get warm. Don't touch it. Leave it alone! Let's go. Why are you here? I want my T -Rex. Just relax. Come sit down. Why can't you let go? What are you scared of? Yourself? -Come on! -The truth's out. Stop. Stop it, c'mon. I don't want to. Too bad. It would've been good. Yeah, for sure. I know you loved me. Admit it. Yes, I loved you. Happy now? I said it. What now? We drop everything and start from scratch? Why not? I won't abandon those I love. Ever. You abandoned me! O.K., I'm sorry. -I was scared. -Of what, me? Morgane, I was scared of you, the lawyer, what we were turning into. Max wasn't me. I'm Julien, a simple guy who loves his kid, his girl. I don't have to always come in first. That's over. I loved Max. So you fucked the lawyer. I paid dearly for it. I wish I hadn't. Shit! You can take a man out of the woods, but not... That's not true. You can change. You just have to try. Don't get angry. I know you're a good kid. But you're a maniac. You could've killed yourself. I'll go. Excuse me. Maybe I wanted to die. We'll set sail on a big ship And drop anchor on a treasure island Look after Theo. Stop, you'll look after Theo. I love you. I love you. They get closer and closer. Think that's a coincidence? Julien? Shit! Christ! -Hello, Dad? -Hello? -Theo? -Daddy! How are you? How's it going? Know what? We went go-karting. It was so cool. I beat everyone. There was a race. -I came in first. -I'm so proud of you. I have to talk to you, it's important. You know I love you. I love you and Mom more than anything. And so does Mom. -Is she dead? -No. She's not dead. She's not dead and I promised to do anything to save her. But maybe I won't be able to. Maybe this is a race I won't win. I understand. Dad? Sing me Mom's song. Well I'm kind of... You know, the song with the elephant and the ship. We'll set sail on a big ship And drop anchor on a treasure island Where those funny birds nest That you see in your dreams But there's no big ship Or island with birds And if I tell tall tales, it's so you'll shut your eyes -On a big elephant... -On an elephant singing opera We'll cross the Sahara And sleep by an oasis -Under the... -Under the licorice trees But there are no... Help Daddy. There are no candy trees And no opera-singing elephants If I spin these fabulous tales It's so you'll fall asleep Theo, I have to go now. Take care of Grampa. I'm counting on you, O.K.? I love you, my love. I love you. Get in! -Thanks. -Don't mention it. This'll take a miracle. You have to believe. It's all or nothing. Do or die! Watch out! Morgane! Morgane, wait!
