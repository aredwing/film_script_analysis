You may have heard|of that valiant struggle... that took place beneath|the golden walls of Troy. Ten years,|the best of our lives. Ten thousand men, the best the gods and dreams|of glory could have fashioned. All led by my brother|Agamemnon, the mightiest of the Greeks. And Achilles, who could|strike down 10 warriors|with one blow. You may even have heard|of Paris, who they say betrayed|his country and crown... for love. But that is not|the way it happened. Let me tell you the real story.|I know. I was there. [Girl]|Kill him.! Kill him! [Woman Groaning]|Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!|Kill him! [Baby Crying] [Woman]|It's a boy, Your Highness.|A boy.! [Crying Continues] You said,|"Kill him. Kill him." Before any of us knew|that it was a boy. Cassandra, have you just had|one of your visions, hmm?|Tell me! Priam, come see your son. Cassandra, come see|your brother Alexandros. Look, Cassandra,|Cassandra... I know that you see things,|and I know that people|don't believe you, but I do. You-You saw that|it was a baby boy, right? Hmm?|What else did you see?|[Panting] What else? If he lives, Troy will burn. [Crying Continues] Take my son to the mountain. No! Throw him|from the highest peak. No!|Do it now! No! No!|No, no, no, no! No! No! Please! No.! Please.! My son.! No.! Gods, do your will. [Baby Crying] Why would they?|What was it, child? Some foul prophet|jealous of your beauty? Never mind. With me|you shall be loved and honored. I shall name you... Paris. [Man]|Paris.! Paris,|where are you? Paris, come.!|Time to eat.! [Laughing] [Grunting] - Ohhh!|- [Laughs] I've got goats|who fight better than you. Hey, too bad you can't|watch your goats|as well as your flank. Look!|What? - [Goat Bleating]|- Watch my herd! Stubos.! [Bleating] [Bell Clanking] Stubos! [Bell Ringing] [Goat Bleating] Stubos? [Water Flowing] Stubos? [Sighs] [Indistinct Whispering] Who's there? Beauty is all: All is beauty. Victory goes|to the strong. Gold rules men.|Wealth is power. Paris must choose. You must judge|who of us is fairest. Who are you? Choose me, Paris.|I am Hera. I can give you wealth|beyond your dreams. Athena brings victory|and glory forever. Look into its face, Paris.|See what Aphrodite gives. The most beautiful|woman in the world... Helen. [Horse Whinnies] [Horse Whinnies] - Pollux!|- You know you can't go|outside the city walls. Father is furious. Come on. Let's get you|bathed and dressed. You can't go to a wedding|looking like that.|That big one in front. Is that Agamem... the one|who's to marry our sister? No. That's his father,|King Atreus. See that one there|with the beard? That's Agamemnon.|They say that one day|he will rule the entire Aegean. Now come on. Let's go.|Who's the other one,|the young one? [Pollux]|That's his brother, Menelaus.|Younger by two years. And not too fond ofliving|in his brother's shadow,|so I hear. Come on.|Let's get you dressed. Where are they from?|Mycenae. Where's that?|Never you mind. Theseus, my king, this is|bad timing, don't you think? The greater the challenge. Don't get me wrong.|I love a challenge. But I just hate|to be missing Athens|in the springtime. You know how|beautiful that is. If you want beauty,|you'll find it right here|beyond those walls. The most beautiful girl|in the world is here in Sparta. She's just a child! I'll ripen her like grapes.|I'll age her like wine. When she ages just enough,|I'll taste her. Well and fine, but not when|the greatest warriors in Mycenae|are just behind those walls. Don't be such a bore.|Let's have some fun. Fun? This is not fun.|Fishing is fun. Playing the lute is fun. Swimming in shark-infested|waters is fun. Committing suicide|is not fun! [Blowing Horn] High King Atreus,|Prince Agamemnon,|Prince Menelaus. We welcome you to Sparta. Great Tyndareus,|made greater by his kindness. Made greater|only by his most dutiful|and obedient daughter. May I present|the lovely Clytemnestra. Clytemnestra... I hereby claim you|as my wife. And who is this? My youngest.|Still a child. An untamed|and disrespectful child,|I might add. Her name, my lord? She is Helen. Helen. Father, I will take her|to her room. Yes, indeed you shall. As punishment for her disrespect,|she will miss the wedding feast. Father-In-Law, I see my bride is distressed. You're quite right. Clytemnestra's little sister|is but a child... a child who meant no harm. Why not invite her|tojoin us? Well, that sounds fair. I would be honored|to be Helen's escort, should the king's|legendary kindness permit. Pollux, see that|she's properly dressed. Yes, Father. Have you ever seen|anything like it?|So much trouble. [Helen]|What's all the fuss about? Don't you understand|anything about anything? You're not a little girl.|You're... You're almost a woman.|What are you doing? I'm no such thing.|You are. Listen.|Listen to me. Get off for a second.|Listen!|No! I won't! Helen! Helen, I love you|more than life. I know it's hard to accept, but someday soon|you will marry. I already know who to. You do?|I saw him. Where?|In the water. You'll marry a fish?|A shepherd. Oh, that's likely.|Helen! I will. I will, Pollux.|I had a vision. I saw his face and...|And what? He saw mine. And one day he'll find me. I know it. I just... I know it.|[Laughs] Good. Good. Meanwhile, you must be ready|for kings and princes|to seek your hand. Why?|Your beauty,|your spirit. It makes men weak. Helen, you have no idea|what madness lies in men. All men, every one. Even you? [Middle Eastern] There she is.|Ah, yes, I see her. [Woman Laughing] [Chattering] [Gasps, Screams] [Muffled Screaming] - Halt there!|- Would you hold this, please? Thank you.|[Grunting] [Screaming Continues] [Helen]|Why are you doing that? Doing what? Casting lots.|And I know what for too. You've no right.|I'm not some sort of a prize... Well done, my friend. So you get the girl,|and I get the horse. Well, I'll just have to find meself|another stunningly beautiful princess. - Persephone, perhaps.|- She's sweet on pomegranates,|I heard. I hate pomegranates. Farewell, my friend. May the gods be kind. Who are you? Theseus, King of Athens. You don't look|like a king. [Spits] You'd better get used to me.|I'm going to marry you. I think you've got me|confused with my sister. I'm not the daughter|ofTyndareus who does|what anybody says. You're not the daughter|of Tyndareus at all. Of course I am. You think my mother found me|under a cabbage leaf? Some say that. I don't. You're Queen Leda's daughter,|all right. There's no mistaking|that face. I'm my father's|daughter too. [Laughs]|You'd have to be.|That's the way it works. Tyndareus is my father. They never told you|anything at all, did they? Told me what? What do you think|happened to your mother? She died.|Why? Because of me.|I made her sick. How? Do you know? Tyndareus told you|you killed your mother? He didn't have to say it. He can't look at me. [Sighs]|Your mother took|her own life, Helen. She leapt from the west wall|of the palace. No. You lie. Why would she?|She was raped. Because she was beautiful? Yeah. [Helen Screams]|Is that what you intend with me? What?|Rape. I don't rape children.|Or are you a woman? No. No. No. Well, when you are,|we'll be good friends.|You will be fine. [Distant Shouting] You can't take away|our best stock. You should be honored.|Honored? That you|steal away our livelihood? [Woman Shouting, Indistinct] You'll be compensated.|Fairly. Fairly compensated. Compensated doesn't|fill our cows with seed. Compensation doesn't|give us meat!|[Man] Paris, where are you? Paris!|They're taking your bull! - That's the property of the king ofTroy!|- No, he's not! He's mine! I raised him!|Hold it! - [Grunting]|- Leave him! Leave my son alone! [Grunting, Groans] [Mooing] Any other objections? [Groaning Continues] He will be the grand prize|in King Priam's games. If you wish to negotiate|with the winner, you will find him there. [Helen]|Tell me the truth|about my mother. I need to know. Please. [Sighs] When it happened,|Tyndareus was away in Egypt. When she began to show|a couple of months later, he'd been gone|for half a year. So the kingdom|watched her belly swell|month after month. She was disgraced. She had no husband|beside her. She waited till|she had you, then... Had me? [Shuddering]|It was me? No! Helen, no.!|There are wolves.! [Sighs, Panting] Do I look like her? Well, you're younger...|and dirtier. When you grow up,|if you grow up and don't|make me wring your neck, you'll be even more|breathtaking. Who was it? Who did it? Tell me who. Helen, you're the daughter|of the greatest god. Zeus is your father. That's why your beauty|will never be matched. That's why no man|will ever resist it. You resisted me. Well...|[Laughs] Not without great effort. Let me be your friend. I think you could do with one. I must always|know the truth. Always. [Paris]|I'm going to Troy.|I'll get our bull back. [Father]|Troy is no place|for people like us. I'm going.|No. They'll hurt you. If these ribs aren't broken,|they will be with one more blow. They can't treat us like that,|like we're nothing. I'll bring back what's ours.|There's no point. There is...|when I win it. [Chattering] [Narrator]|And so Paris came to Troy. It was the richest|city in the world. Into it were brought|silks from Asia, spices from Arabia,|rare woods from Africa. [Chicken Clucking] [Speaking Asian Language] A feast for the eyes.|Both of them. Huh? [Chattering Continues] [Narrator]|From its strategic harbor,|with its massive walls, Troy controlled all trade|north and south of the Aegean. And Paris would control|Troy's fate... more than he could know. [Horse Whinnying] [Bull Mooing] [Mooing Continues] [Applause, Cheering] [Chattering] [Cheering Continues] [Crowd Chanting]|Hector.! Hector.! Hector.! Hector.! You here to sign up? What's your name? Paris.|Of? As in where from? [Applause]|Mount Ida. All right.|Where's your cuirass? - My what?|- Breastplate. No? What about a helmet? Any kind of armor? Boy! Fetch me|some of that old armor. How about your cudgel? I could use this. Look here, lad,|you can't win, but at least you have|to put on a good show. Go ahead, choose one. You'll find some|better than others. Why can't I win? No one ever beats|Prince Hector. [Applause, Cheering] Leave your knife|on the rack. Hey, shepherd boy.!|The hero from Mt. Ida.! [Laughing] Ah, the king's thief. You're on, shepherd.|With your friend. Go.! Go, go.! Paris of Mt. Ida|meets Pres Byterian, commander of the guard.! [Cheering, Booing] [Booing, Jeering] [Both Grunting] [Grunting] [Cheering]|[Announcer]|The winner is Paris of Mt. Ida. [Groaning] Need better armor. This old Hittite stuff is junk. Is it bad?|It's nothing. An old wound.|You shouldn't be fighting. I have to. Oh, really?|And why is that? I don't like thieves|sent by kings... to steal my livestock|for their games and amusement. The bull? My bull. Ah. [Laughing] [Crowd Cheering] My father's games|must be fair. I can't fight|a wounded man. The rules are clear,|my lord. You must. Paris. Son.|[Groaning] Paris of Mt. Ida|will fight Damien of Argos. You're hurt.|I'll be fine. Your ribs.|You can't.|Father, I'll be fine. [Crowd Cheering] [Announcer]|The winner is Paris of Mt. Ida.! [Crowd Cheering] [Announcer Continues] Paris, you must stop this.|I've seen these|crush a man's head. [Gasps]|Paris, you must|never mind what happened. We'll survive|without our bull. Paris,|you're my only child. I beg you, come home. [Panting]|You raised me to be strong, to be loyal, to defend what I believe in. [Announcer]|Paris of Mt. Ida... will fight|Hideus of Seronea. I love you, Father. [Announcer]|The winner.'|Paris of Mt. Ida.! I can't watch|my only son get killed. He's not your son.|Begone, old shepherd. Wait.|He's my father. No, Paris, don't.|It's Princess Cassandra. Alexandros. My name is Paris. You should be dead. Give me a minute. [Announcer]|The final match.! Prince Hector ofTroy... against Paris of Mt. Ida.! No! [Whispering]|You must kill him. These are just games,|Cassandra. You don't understand! Look, he is good,|but he's only a shepherd.|He's Alexandros. He's baby Alexandros! If you love your family,|honor Troy, you must destroy him. You don't intend to fight me? I'll fight you the way I live,|not Troy's way. Do you know how to use|a dagger, shepherd? Can't stop wolves with sticks. What is he doing? Then use it. [Crowd Murmuring] [Both Grunting] [Grunting Continues] - Kill him!|- What? [Yelling] Come on! [Cassandra]|Kill him.! Kill him.! Kill him.! Kill him! Kill him! Alexandros? [Screaming]|Kill him! Do you surrender? I am prepared to die. I don't want your life! Does Prince Hector|surrender? Does Troy surrender? The winner.'|Paris of Mt. Ida.! [Crowd Cheering] Approach,|Paris of Mt. Ida. Don't look at him, Mother. Alexandros? Are you Alexandros? My name is Paris. Father,|what are you doing? We have our bull.|We can go home. You are home. Noble King Priam, if someone must be punished,|let it be me. My son?|There is no doubt,|my queen. I found him|on the mountain. [Sobs] My darling, darling child. Shepherd... you've done well. You have brought home|our son. Welcome home... Prince Paris ofTroy! [Cheering, Applause] The prophecy|has been fulfilled. What prophecy? Because you live,|we all must die. [Horse Nickers] How was the ride? Ohh. Mount Hymettus honey. Best in the world. How do you know|it's the best? Well,|I suppose I don't. Well, then|there's always a chance... you might find|something better. No. I want to love.|Well, you will someday. I'm ready now. You're young. I'm a woman. Someday, someplace|you'll find someone better. Someone worthier. When you do,|neither the gods' will|nor the earth's turning... will keep you from him. That's how I feel|about you. But, Helen, this has just been...|well, a kind of practice. Someday|you'll know the difference. You always said|that we'd marry. Helen. Hey. [Gasps] Pollux!|Shh. Quiet. Why are you here?|We finally found you. You're safe now. [Murmuring] [Shouting] [Gasps] Aah! [Grunting] Leave him! Let me go! Let me go!|Pollux, make them stop! Get her out of here!|Don't let her see this! It will warm her heart! No, Pollux!|You don't understand! Get off me.!|[Grunts] Aah! [Grunting Continues] Pollux, if you love me,|hear me.! Let me go! No!|It's all right, Helen.! It's a fair price,|and I gladly pay it. - [Groans]|- No! [Whimpering]|No! - [Grunts]|- Pollux! - No!|- [Helen Screaming] [No Audio] [Narrator]|With the death of Pollux,|Tyndareus had no heir. The great kings|of the Aegean... were drawn to Sparta|like moths to the flame. Odysseus, king of Ithaca,|remembers the fallen Pollux... and offers his heart|to the great king|Tyndareus. Achilles brings greetings|from the Myrmidons... who stand shoulder to shoulder|with the people of Sparta... to defend the honor of Sparta... and to revenge the blood|of the great king Tyndareus. To die for a woman...|it's hard to imagine|such weakness. You cannot comment.|You have not seen her. - I don't need to.|- [Scoffs] - You afraid to try?|- I'm afraid of nothing. There. You shed no tears. By your actions,|you have left me|without love or hope... and Sparta without|its future king, and you show no grief. [Tyndareus]|It should have been you|who died. Is there any among you|who will take|this cursed woman? Is there|any among you... who wishes their home devastated, his country brought to ruin, his heart broken beyond repair? I leave her to you. Leave her! Tyndareus is right. She'll bring her husband|more trouble|than he could ever imagine. [Odysseus]|The path to her bed|is strewn with ash and death. And yet is there not one man|'round this table|who does not want her? Do you suggest that|every king here draw his sword|against the other? No. Of course not.|That would be... What he wants is to|have her all to himself. Isn't that right,|little brother?|[Kings Laughing] In truth, if we raise|our swords at all, it should be together|and pointed|in the same direction. Toward riches|in Byzantium. Or Perseus. If we unite,|we can conquer|anything at all. Any creature,|any nation. Well spoken, Agamemnon,|but you control no army. Perhaps I should|tell you, brothers,|that as we speak... our father,|the clear-eyed Atreus,|lies alone, speaking only|with the gods. In a matter of days they|will take him, and I will return|to the citadel at Mycenae. [Achilles]|Then let us greet you now|as our new high king... mighty Agamemnon|of Mycenae. Agamemnon!|[All]|Agamemnon! Can we agree to unite|in time of war? What do you say,|Odysseus?|I have a family. I'd rather plow a field|and sow it with salt|than go to war. [Sighs]|And you, Achilles? Some of us may prefer|a long and quiet life|at home. I, for one,|would live it short... if I knew I could die|with a taste of glory|on my lips. You will have it short|if one of us takes Helen. [Scoffs, Chuckles] And yet, perhaps this is the way|that we can unite|as Agamemnon wishes. Good Odysseus,|the wisest of us all. [Scoffs]|Tell us, O wise one,|what do you propose? Two things. First,|we swear an oath. What sort|of oath? Whoever takes Helen... can trust that we will defend|that man's sole right to her|with our lives. The rest must be content|to admire her from afar. And second? We cast lots.|The winner takes the bride. Never! Who... What gives you the right|to agree on such a thing? The right of one man|to one vote. Who in the world|has ever heard of that?|There is no such thing. Then we begin here. Who swears the oath? Agamemnon, as we two|are the only ones|who are married, how do you suggest|we cast the lots? Given this noble|assemblage, I would say our seals. Closest to the jar... may claim his bride. Menelaus. What say you, my brother? I say|the gods have spoken. And each man here|would be wise|to keep his oath... or face the everlasting wrath|of Mount Olympus. [Giggling] Your daughter|is so lovely. [Chuckles] She reminds me of you. [Giggling Continues] So long ago. Iphigenia, come. Say good night|to your aunt. Have you|been bouncing? Ohh! Give your aunt a kiss. [Chuckles] Go to bed.|Quickly. Making a child so sweet|might be reason enough to live. You have many reasons,|Helen. Tomorrow you will marry|my husband's brother. We'll be sisters|and sisters-in-law both. Yes. They are hard men. But it is possible|to love them. Paris? Father asked|to see you. Hmph. He's sending you|to Sparta. Why? Because he wants you|to take a message|to the new king Menelaus, younger brother|of High King Agamemnon|of Mycenae. High king?|Some sort of|supreme ruler, is he? That's right. And now he's talking more|against Troy. Why? Because we control access|to the silks and spices|of Byzantium. [Scoffs] What? I just can't believe|people go to war|over nutmeg. Well, they do, Paris,|and you'd better|get used to it. Where is he now,|this high king of theirs? Don't know. Agamemnon's in Sparta|for the funeral ofTyndareus|and the crowning of Menelaus, and when I get there|it will appear that I've been|sent to drive a wedge... between the brothers, who will then kill me|and put my head on a spike. Then Troy will be rid of me,|Cassandra will be redeemed... and you can get back to being|the sole heir to the throne. Am I close? You're being a fool. Look me in the eye|and say that. Look me in the eye. Brother, if the gods|have divined it, so be it. [Winds Whistling] Such strong winds,|my lord. The gods must have|hurried us here. Yes, it would seem. They must favor|your mission. I wouldn't|count on it. Oh. Helen,|I'm the obedient wife, but even I will tell you... he's taken this oath|too far. When you were a child|and Father punished you, you would always|come back fighting. Why aren't you|fighting now? I've caused such grief|and destruction. Helen, you did not ask|to be kidnapped. Nor rescued,|for that matter. It's not your fault. [Whispers]|It's Paris ofTroy. Bring him here. You don't know. Why do you|have to do this? Menelaus commands it.|I don't do it|for Agamemnon. Ten thousand men|have sworn their lives... to defend|the right of Menelaus|to have me. Agamemnon believes|the king... should seek proof|of my worth. How can you let them|treat you like this? They can look|all they want, but they'll|never see me. [Crowd Chattering,|Murmuring] [Men Shouting Approval] Truly magnificent. Breathtaking. [Murmuring,|Shouting Continue] - [Grunting]|- Wait! Wait! Wait!|We come in peace! I'll be fine. He seeks peace,|my brother. There is no peace|with Troy. He bears a letter|from their king. To whom|is it addressed? [Crowd Murmuring] Do not shame me,|brother. Troy seeks to align|with Sparta... and Sparta alone. They have sent him|to drive a wedge|between us. We can let nothing|divide the blood|of the house of Atreus. But not now. Not here. Let him remain,|freely speaking... until we know enough ofTroy|to find a way|inside its golden walls. The weight of a crown|has made my little brother|wise beyond my expectations. [Laughing,|Chattering Resume] [Sniffling] [Winds Whistling] Catch me, Theseus. Catch me, Pollux. [Gasps] You. I've seen you. In the pool. You saw too. I've come for you. It's too late. The gods decree it. Aphrodite herself.|[Helen]|Then the gods torment me. How can you say that? When I'm there with them,|I feel nothing. Naked in front of|a hundred kings... nothing. But then tonight, when I saw you, something began to|tear away my shield, to expose the one thing|that I cannot endure. Hope. [Sighs] Have it now. I love you.|[Gasps, Sobs] Loving me|kills people. It destroys families,|causes such grief|you cannot imagine. I've imagined you|all these years. And now I've found you,|I cannot let you go. I will never leave you. The day I do|is the day I die. Go away. Leave me. You must never see me again. [Groans] You consort with a Trojan,|an enemy of Sparta. Do you want|to be put to death?|Yes, I do! [Trembling] What's happened to you?|I've become visible. You're not making sense|about anything. You meet some envoy,|and before you...|No! I didn't|just meet him. I've loved him for years,|before you even|married Agamemnon. That can't be possible. It's not true,|is it? What's going to happen? I heard|Agamemnon and Menelaus|talk ofTroy. And? Tomorrow they will ask|the envoy about his city. When Agamemnon has learned|all he needs to know, we will return to Mycenae|and Menelaus... Will kill him. You did well tonight. The kings were pleased. Until the envoy|arrived. Yes. Why is he here? That makes|no matter. Did he come|bearing tribute? There is no tribute|that compares with you. You are a generous man. No, I'm a lucky man. [Giggling] [Paris]|You mean stealing's|not a crime in Sparta? [Menelaus]|Being caught is the crime,|always. There was a boy...|young, no more than 10. He stole a fox|and hid it|under his cloak. He died|while being questioned, and when they removed|his cloak... they found he'd let the fox|gnaw through his body|rather than reveal his theft. Such boys|make good soldiers. Yes, they do. We train them|from the age of seven. Ours learn to tame horses|from a young age. You must visit our stables|whilst you are here. They're not as grand|as your own, I'm sure. I have heard people say... that the walls of Troy|are made of gold. Is this really true? No. But they are beautiful. [Clytemnestra]|Iphigenia, where are you? Perhaps one day I will|see the walls ofTroy|for myself. [Gasps] Ah.! I found you.!|[Giggling] No man can possess|all he desires. Calchas! My lord? My wife tells me... that no man|can claim the world. What say the gods? Olympus favors|the high king... who one day will rule|the entire Aegean. You may bear|my children, but never again|will you interfere|with my affairs. Is that understood? - [Grunting]|- Come with me! You! And you!|Let's go!|[Woman Screaming] Quiet!|Let's go! I thought we were here|to make peace. We like|making peace.|Yes. A lot. The Greeks|have other ideas. What sort|of ideas? Like cut off our heads,|put them on pikes,|let birds eat our eyes. That sort of thing. Prince Paris ofTroy, my king bids you|a fond good night. [Grunting] Aah!|[Groaning] Man those oars!|Get to the turret! Go now.|You're free. Without you? You have my love. Without you|I have nothing. My lord.!|My lord.! The tide|begins to turn.! Menelaus is shamed, but he fears to harm me. Now go. I beg you!|Please go! My lord!|The wind is up! Please. Please. Make way, men! [Crewmen Shouting,|Chattering] [Crewman]|Ready oars.! Ready? Pull.! Ready? Pull.! Ready? Pull! No. [Crewman]|Hold oars.! Make way! What have we done? [Crowd Shouting,|Cheering] [Crowd]|Ohh! [Crowd Cheering,|Whistling]|Well fought, Croesus. [Crowd Chanting]|Achilles.! Achilles.! [Chanting Continues]|Your news precedes you. As the gods are my witness,|I will kill that man.|You can be sure of it. You brought dishonor|on yourself and shame|to the house of Atreus. I'll have the Trojan's head|on a spike! Not without my help.|Ah, yes. Well, as always,|I must bear the weight|of your shadow. You're a smudge|on history's ledger,|Menelaus, but you are my brother. What's more,|the kings of the Aegean|have sworn an oath. To unite,|as I recall. The oath did not place you|in command of me,|of my army, or any other... Do not incur my wrath,|little brother. Do not. These are my terms. You may have the Trojan... and your whore. I will take Troy. You will share|no spoils... not a scrap|of broken clay, not an ingot|of their basest metal. Agreed? I am your brother...|Do you agree? [Crowd Quiets] What makes you think|the kings will unite|behind you? The gods have written it. And you know for certain|they favor you in this?|For certain! [Crewmen Shouting] Save him! Swim, Clemyetus! Throw me the line! Reach for me! Aah! [Screaming] [Sighs] Two months. The wind|remains against us. The men|grow impatient! I grow impatient,|Achilles. Calchas. My lord. When will the winds|blow with us? What say the gods? Speak, seer. What must I do? A terrible thing. Tell me. I command you. The goddess Artemis|asks for your daughter. In trade for fair wind, Artemis demands|your daughter's life... here, on this altar. And this...|will satisfy the goddess? But you must hold|the knife. The gods demand it. Of course they do. The winds|will soon be with us. Pitch! Oh! [Giggles] Okay, ready? Ready? [Laughing] [Continues Giggling,|Laughing] [Laughing Continues] [Blade Slicing]|[Laughing Stops] [All Shouting] To Troy!|To Troy! [Shouting Continues] Must we leave now that the ship's repaired? The men have asked--|I understand. I know. They have wives, families. You know, we could stay here,|just the two of us. I promise you I'll make|a far better shepherd than I do a prince. My lord! Many ships! We have to warn Troy. You must go now. We must go now. You can't give Agamemnon an excuse for war. Agamemnon wants Troy. He's always wanted Troy. That's why my father sent me to Sparta. And now, wherever this path may lead, we're on it together. [People Chattering] This way. Hector.|The elders demand to see you. Alone. - Do not harm her.|- I'll be all right. It is you who brings harm to Troy. Men, thank you.|Go home. You steal the king of Sparta's wife? And you bring her here... with the entire Aegean fleet on your heels, and you expect us to turn a blind eye|to your wanton frolics? Father, please allow me to present my case. You have presented us with a war!|That is case enough. Agamemnon presents war, not I. You sent me to Sparta to confirm it, my king. Elders of Troy, the high king of Mycean|has fastened himself to Troy... as gateway to the treasures of Byzantium. The woman belongs to Sparta. Where she's treated worse|than a Hittite whore? Forced to walk naked|among Aegean kings who leer... and spit obscenities. I did not take her. I saved her from a people|who find no worth in women, place no value on beauty... and seek their only honor|through glorious death in battle. Father, do not listen.|The woman brings the end of Troy. [Whispering] She must be returned to Sparta. - Where is Helen?|- She's being prepared. - For what?|- Her husband. Does Troy so fear the Aegeans it turns|its face from mercy? Are the gilded walls of Ilium so weak... they cannot defend kindness and compassion? Are you all blind? The woman is a Spartan. She must leave here.|She must go. She will kill us all. Good King, your daughter speaks the truth. I have no right to be here. Helen. I wish to return to my husband. [Man] Row! Row! Your wife awaits you. Menelaus, king of Sparta! Odysseus, king of Ithaca! Troy welcomes you. Great King Priam, we are... honored to stand before you. We know you to be just... and wise, and therefore will see reason... to return to Sparta... what belongs to Sparta. For what purpose? Purpose? You ask us to return to Sparta|that which belongs to Sparta. is this your property,|your chattel or your evening's amusement? Will you insult me? I demand you return my wife! Bold King of Sparta, I ask the question again. - For what purpose?|- Because she is mine! Because she is my wife! It is a simple question. And I will make it painfully simple|if only for your benefit. You will return Helen... to me... or the combined armies|of the Aegean will sack your city... and raze it to the ground! Good King Priam, if I may speak on the matter. A man loses his wife to another. Perhaps she's stolen.|Perhaps she goes of her own free will. It makes no difference. That man is so consumed... with grief and passion, he becomes rash, even senseless at times. It would be the same for any man here-- the farmer in the field,|the merchant in the street, even a king. King Menelaus pleads with you|to return his wife. For what purpose, you ask. For the only purpose|that can account for such fervor. Love. Only that. King Odysseus, you've spoken well and wisely. You shall have our answer... before sunrise. Leave us. I asked to be returned. is that what you want? It is my duty. I have two questions. Do you love my son? With all my heart. If I send you back, will it stop this war? Why not? - I know him.|- Menelaus? The other. Bring me Achilles. The main fleet lands here,|Agamemnon and I here. We scale the cliffs to a plain that leads to|the marketplace below the city. Up a staircase, through an arch|in front of the city gates. The moment we attack,|the merchants will retreat to the city. And the weakness of compassion|will keep the gates open. Menelaus, take the beach.|We will pass through the market in disguise. A short life full of glory.|Isn't that what you wished? May the gods smile on our destiny. [Priam] I agree with the elders, who have no doubt|that the high king of Mycenae comes to Troy... for the purpose of making war. We are also aware of speculation that he|has sacrificed his daughter... for the purpose of securing a favorable wind. This is not the conduct of a man of peace. We also agree that to sacrifice your honor, or even your life,|will not appease his desire... or make peace more likely. For these reasons, we invite you to consider this city|to be your home... for as long as you shall live. Furthermore, should you|choose to renounce... any further affiliation with Sparta, you shall henceforth be known... as Helen of Troy. Do you accept this offer? I accept. [Squawking] It appears they will keep her. To Troy!|[Men Cheering] [All Shouting] [Man] Move ahead! [Grunting] [Shouts] We need to move the barriers now! Drop and hold now! [Panicked Chattering] On to Troy! [Screams] [Woman] There is no time. Move away! Soldiers!|Alert the guards. You brought all this upon us, Paris. You and your golden Aphrodite! [Man] They're coming! Onward! [All Shouting] Fall before Achilles! Archers! Fire! [Shouting, Sword Clashing Stops] I fear for Agamemnon!|He should be here by now! Spartans! Follow me! Bring armors! Ten of your best men. [Ferocious Yell] Back to Troy! - [Screams]|- Agamemnon! Unfortunate. Paris! Thank you, brother. Retreat from the archers! Head them off! Now! Fall back! There! [Groans] Quickly! Close the gates! Well done, my boy.|Thank you, Father. I owe you my life. We are blood. What say you now, sister? Will Troy still burn? Don't ask a question|if you don't want an answer. Well, Cassandra, is there an answer? For 10 years,|the Greeks will pillage our country, attack our gates. For 10 years, they will raid|the southern shores, enslave our neighbors, fatten themselves|on their butchered cattle, become rich with spoils. And our friends will flee here and flee here, flee here... until these walls are packed|with broken people... and our city is filled with sorrow,|our streets flooded with tears, until there will not be one of us... with food to eat, water to drink|or air to breathe! - Cassandra! Enough!|- The war will not be over until the curse is lifted. You all know it. Why can you not understand?|Why do you not believe? Because, child, we must not believe you. We cannot believe you. - Paris must die.|- [Hector] Stop her, Father! I cannot stop.|I will not stop until you listen! Cassandra, please.|You don't know what you're saying. I say the truth, only the truth! But none of you have seen... what I see.|[Gasping] - She's mad.|- [Screaming] Enough! This family, this city speaks with one voice! There will be no dissent. Guard! Take her away.|Put her in the dungeon. [Screaming Continues] A creature will come,|a creature that eats men! He will eat you, Father!|And you! and you! and you! He will eat all of you! [Screaming] You all will die! [Screaming] [Narrator] And so 10 years passed|beneath the walls of Troy. At home our own cities crumbled into ruin. The men had lost all their dreams. They'd forgotten what|their own wives looked like. But I could not forget,|and Agamemnon would not forget, and so we stayed... and stayed. Well, I'm glad that there is laughter in here.|Really. There is none outside in the camp. The men want to go home. Menelaus is right.|My wife has suitors breaking down the door. Her weaving ruse will only last so long. [Laughter] And 10 years is too long. We must finish this war... or go home. So we shall.|[Menelaus] So we shall what? Fight... or retreat? Both. When the outcome of Troy|is determined, I wish to know it. You seem sad. What? A message. Agamemnon proposes peace. At what price? [Agamemnon] This war has gone on too long. I propose... we negotiate an end to it. On what terms? Paris fights Menelaus. Single combat. Whoever wins... claims Helen. Helen belongs to Troy. No matter who wins, we will leave. If you speak for Menelaus,|it's you I should fight. My brother? I challenge you, Paris, to the death... for my wife! And for my honor. - Your weapon?|- Javelin. I accept. These belonged to Atreus. It is he you avenge today. Can you envision a future... where some feckless Trojan... leaps up onto the tomb|of the great Menelaus... and proudly recounts this day? Can you see that day, my brother? Can you even imagine it? [Cheering, Shouting] [Cheering Grows Louder] [Cheering] [Cheering] Oh. Aah. [Cheering] [Cheering] [Panting] [Sniffing] [Cheering] [Ferocious Yell] [Yells, Grunts] [Jug Shatters]|[Men Cheering] Revenge the house of Atreus! Die, Trojan. Die! [Menelaus Grunts] [Gagging] [Gasping, Panting] [Coughing] [Panting, Grunting] The gods must be on your side. [Panting]|I could have told you that. [Sniffs] I know this substance. How long have I got? The Thracians use it to hunt monkeys. It's not lethal, just--|Unfair. I swear I did not know. Tell me something. Do you-- Do you honestly believe|that you deserve her more than I do? Yes. Yes, I do. We took an oath. I am ashamed, the way we-- the way I treated her. Somehow, I feel... you're not much like your brother. Something you might have noticed in|Sparta before you abused my hospitality. Before you had me killed, you mean. I might have let you go. Probably not. Is she well? Yes. Does she ever-- Has she spoken of me? Now I must ask you something. [Sighs]|Agamemnon wants Troy, not Helen. Yes. Then why are we trying to kill each other? His amusement. Have you ever thought|some day you should defy him? Can you walk? I think so. [Man] There's Menelaus! [Cheering] You're alive!|A misunderstanding. [Man Shouts] Paris lives! [Cheering] [Man] All hail Prince Paris! They will fight again tomorrow. No. We will settle this today. I will take the place of my brother. Hector! I challenge you, High King Agamemnon! But this time without poison! You do not stand for me.|I cannot allow you to fight for me. I stand for Troy. - I fight for my country!|- Not my firstborn. [Crowd Cheering] Hector, it is for me|to end it with Agamemnon. It is my path to follow. You are my mortal brother, and I am proud to share your journey. Hector, my boy! Come back|within these walls, I beg you. I stand for High King Agamemnon. I've skewered nothing but rabble|for the last 10 years. I'm sick of it! I thirst for royal blood. Mighty Achilles!|Helen is not your fight. I do not fight for Helen.|[Paris] Then for what? Something a Trojan could never understand. Achilles fights for his own hollow pride! He honors nothing|but his own image in the glass! He hungers only for glory.|If you do not feed him, he will starve! [Priam] Hector, my boy, pity your|mother's misery... and mine. I beg you, do not hand over your glory|and your own sweet life... to such a brutal, war-loving dog! You throw first. - We should draw lots.|- No. Go ahead. Take it. I'm waiting. You should have hit me|when you had the chance. - I don't fight that way!|- I do! - No!|- [Hecuba Screams] No. [Screams] Achilles! Take me! Die, Hector! [Hector Groaning] [Sobbing] [Soldiers Cheering] [Cheering Continues] [Grunting] Today I feed your son to my dogs! [Sobbing]|Tomorrow they will devour your Prince Paris! [Indistinct Shout] Hyah! [Sobbing Continues] [Prisoners Wailing] [Cell Door Slams] - Cassandra?|- Leave me! Paris believes Aphrodite protects him. Can you see--|You bring ruin to my house, kill my family, destroy my world, and you expect me to soothe your worries! How dare you!|[Spits] [Panting] - My brother is dead.|- Yes. It wasn't a question. Then you must know why I'm here. I will do anything to save him.|Anything. Tell me what to do. - See me.|- I do. See me. See me! Achilles dies.|The war begins again. Ajax dies. Odysseus is wounded, also Agamemnon. When the day's sun sets,|only Menelaus will be left to lead. Paris won't die? Not today. - And if I--|- Give myself up? if you surrender to Agamemnon,|the Aegeans will leave. - And Paris?|- He will live. Wake Prince Paris, quickly! Sire, your lady has left the palace.|Huh? [Shouting, Chattering] [Horse Neighing] Hyah!|[Horse Neighing] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Brave Trojans, please. I thank you with all my heart. But this is a weight I must bear alone. High King of Mycenae, I come to end this war. Just like that? I will do your bidding. My bidding? A trade. The daughter of Zeus for the body of Hector. And you think that's enough? Do you think my daughter's|death was for nothing? Hmm?|Is that what you think? is that what you're saying? Can you even imagine|the innocence in her eyes... as she reached out for her own father? He held her in his arms, raised her up. Poor little love. So full of trust. As if he somehow was capable of good. And then that startled look. Can you imagine? No. Then I will tell you. There is no trade. Not you, not Troy, not even my own life|will balance the scales. Now, do you understand? Yes, I understand. Your rage destroys worlds, but it is yourself you hate. [Soldiers Cheering] [Soldiers Chanting]|Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! [Shouting] Achilles! Achilles!|Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!|Achilles! [Chanting Continues] [Shouts]|Hyah! Achilles! Achilles! [Chanting Continues] Agamemnon! We end this now!|Right here, to the death! Whoa! I stand for High King Agamemnon! - Hyah!|- [Horse Neighs] Hyah! Hyah! [Horse Neighs] [Screams] [Horse Neighs] - Paris!|- [Paris Groans] [Soldiers Yelling] - It's Paris!|- After him! You've given me a hundred|lifetimes worth of happiness. [Gasps] Paris! Paris! [Groans] Paris.|[Sobbing] Please stay. Please stay. Please. Please. Goddess. [Horn Blows] He wouldn't believe the prophecy. He always saw the fire in Cassandra's dream|as a burning love for you. My king, the Greeks have sailed. Can it be possible? Search their camp. [Dog Panting, Whimpering] [Singing In Foreign Language] - Mommy!|- What is it? - [Chattering]|- What is that? I've never seen anything like that. [Chattering Continues] The Aegeans are not to be|trusted, nor their gifts. Archers! Burn it. Noble king, this is a day|of great sadness for you. Still, we must not be rash. This, whatever it is,|might be an offering... or a gift to honor|the great horse tamers of Troy. Hands that built this killed my sons. [Shouting In Foreign Language] [Foreign Language] What is he saying? It seems they've left him here|as some kind of sacrifice. [Foreign Language] What about the creature|they left behind? Why so big? [Foreign Language] An offering to their goddess Athena. [Foreign Language] It's big to shadow our city. They say we cannot get it inside our gates. That's what they think, do they? - Hmm!|- [Foreign Language] Dig him out. It's too big! [Crowd Cheering] [Chattering] [Roars] [Gasps] [Chattering] Cassandra? Can you see what happens? I see you... following. What am I following? Who? Where am I going? Where you belong. I belong with Paris. I gave myself up.|It didn't save him! You gave yourself up, but you didn't surrender, did you? Did you? Do you see him? No. Not yet. [Hecuba] I hear them playing. I can always tell that sweet laughter. [Chuckles]|Little Hector. Do you see them? Yes, yes, yes.|I see them. Are they all right? Yes, they're all right. When they grow up, they will make you so proud of them. So very, very proud. You gave me such beautiful children. Such beautiful children. [Humming] We are free, my friend. [Neck Snaps] [Taps Horse] [Men Gasping] Well done, cousin. [Men Grunting] [Footsteps Approaching] Spare my queen. [Gasps, Groans] [Screaming] [Sobbing, Screaming] [Screaming Continues] Bring her. My lord, this way. As I said, no trade. [Screams] No! [Helen Screaming] [Grunting] [Helen] No! No! No! [Crying] Leave her! [Crying Continues] [Grunting] [No Audible Dialogue] [Baby Crying] [Chattering] [Woman Screaming] [Chattering Continues] [Woman Screaming] [Horse Neighing] Helen. What has he done? Go. Go quickly. Clytemnestra. I told you once. Never interfere! I come for Iphigenia. She's not here. I know. [Yelling] My daughter! [Yelling Continues] My daughter! [Baby Crying] [Women Screaming] [Soldiers Laughing] [Narrator] War is waged by nations, but it is human beings that pay the price. For those of us that survived,|we are left with the memory... of shame and misery and bloodshed.|The king is dead! In these dark times, the only thing we have left|to hold on to is love, the one true gift of the gods. And it is through love... that we hope and pray... the gods will send us peace. - Paris.|- Brave Helen. Wherever you are, take me with you. I cannot. Will we ever meet again? I've prepared your place. Good. Do you think I would kill you, Helen? I do not thank you for my life. I understand. I cannot love you. What will you do? [Sniffs]|I will follow. I accept.
