''One is learned, the other is humble and docile.'' ''One is intelligent in business.'' ''One is very religious and conscious of duty.'' ''They are all a shadow of theirfather. ''One is a devotee ofhis father, the other obeys his every word.'' ''Even in dreams they don't wish evil for anybody.'' Brother and sister-in-law! Our best wishes foryour 25th wedding anniversary! Thank you, sir. How is our attorney without his black coat? l've taken leave from court. lfl'd have gone to work today, l don't know what my sisterwould say! No public prosecutor would be able to help me. See how he is teasing me! Have a sweet, Ram Kishen. On this day, he will eat if his wife feeds him not you. Sweetmeat made by you. Terrific! Great! Give some to the kids. You're the last to come forthe prayers. And right in front forthe sweets! - l was right in time. Ask brother. Happy anniversary. - Live long. He's getting spoilt because you pamper him! Mother.. - Have one. Sir... - Mr. Khan? Happy anniversary. - Thanks so much. Best wishes from our office and factory staff. Mr. Vivek, l've made the list of the guests fortonight's function. Are you my secretary orthe kids'? They've been busy with arranging the function for a whole week. Frankly speaking, these are the occasions to share joys with all. The entire family meets underthis pretext. Where's that friend of yours, Anwar? That's how it's so calm. He's gone to pick up Sangita and Anandbabu. Sounds like Sangita and our son-in-law are here! Grandma!!! My dear... Enough.. welcome. Brother! Anurag and his wife, Jyoti are not to be seen. You know my elder brother has no time for himself. Doesn't matter. At least theirtwo children are here. They have grown so attached to us that it's amazing. l feel l have 3 grand children. Take these... Just give them one. Their pockets are full of chocolates. Before us, who gave them chocolates? Who else but Anwar spoils them? You make mistakes and hold me responsible for it? What have l done? You come here just once a year. lsn't that bad enough? And look at her cheek! Where has she gone? Says, we mustn't spoil the kids. - l apologise. Sorry. What do you say? You are forgiven. Eat some sweets. Papa, he got it stitched in his presence. And this is foryou. This to is his choice. He's got great selection! He has knowledge of everything. You and Mummy have to wear these in the function. And what will the children wear? l'll wear an achkan. - l'll wear a skirt and scarf. What about you? l'll wear a silk achkan and an embroidered fez cap. Excuse me. -Yes? Don't you have to go to your shop? - Today is a holiday. l had a dream last night. Anwar Band & Co. is locked up! Of course. He's here all day. How does he run his shop? lt's doing very well. Thank you. Anyway what does man need? Motherfeeds me great food. And fatherteaches me good lessons oflife. Everyone should have one such friend in their lives. But my friend still hasn't turned up. l'm dead tired! Anybody there? Quickly hide the food! Hide it. What's wrong, Pritam uncle. - Don't ask, son. lt's his 25th anniversary and l had to make 25 trips! Hunting for a gift for him! Where's my gift? - There he comes to the point! Just a minute. A pocket watch foryour coat. And ear rings foryou! Matching today's outfits. -You're very forward! Did you know what son-in-law was going to present them! ls he only your son-in-law? Does he mean nothing to me? Look at that veil! -Aunt dearest... Caught you! Caught the sweets! Just one. The doctor's orders. Forget it! Just because my daughter has become a doctor, life is tough! Making me diet forever! - But where is Preeti? Must be on herway with Dr. Sen. Congratulations. - Thank you, doctor. Where is Preeti? - Oh, where is she? Just you wait! - Hey, listen...! These girls are worse than boys! Childhood friends meet and that's it! The progress is much betterthan l thought. God willing, we'll get some movement in his hand. We have full faith since we came in touch with you. Don't be silly. Homeopathy is effective even in the most serious ailments. Even ifit's a childhood injury. lt will be effective only when Vivek takes medication in time. Anwar pesters him so he takes it Else he is so busy with work. The bottle ofhis pills is always in my pocket. Then whether he yells or screams l pop the pills in his mouth. Open your mouth. lt's time foryour dose. Whether my arm gets better or not... One thing is for sure, soon we're going to get a strict but good doctor. Don't praise her so much that she starts flying high! What a tragedy! l started restaurants in my daughter's name. How often l've told herto go there and eat and feed friends. But no way. l don't know what's the charm in your profession! Uncle always talks like this when he's hungry. You'll realise when you have to eat carrots and cucumber all day! But l won't pay heed to her in the party. Prem returns today. l'll gorge to my heart's content! l'll meet Prem in the evening. Our second brother, Prem returns from America today. Would you like to express the depth of your happiness? Why do you keep troubling the poor girl? Don't we know someday these two hearts are going to be one? Who has gone to the airport to pick him up? Nobody. -Why? His instructions are clear. Nobody need come there, just send the car. My younger brother doesn't want to trouble anybody. He's a real saint. God knows what will happen to this boy. He's one in a million. Sir has called you to the hall. The decorators have arrived. Do you know how Preeti blushes the moment she hears Prem's name? Like Anwar blushes at seeing you! l swear, what a dangerous man! Once more. When did you come? -Just now. Father and grandma too are here. - Grandma has come! Will you let go? The foreigner returns home. Finally my eyes are at rest. Aunt, we really appreciate it that you came from the village for us. We had to come. After all we belong to the same village. And neighbours at that. Take charge of the function. l've brought all the articles forthe stage decoration. The decoration will be according to the music. Because uncle loves music. Sapna really works very hard. Always first in college. She lends you a helping hand at home and herfather at work. And take a look at my son, Vinod. He wakes up at 8! We're beginning the second round. Has yourfatherfinished his prayers? Whenever l step into this house, l feel l'm entering a palace! l have a small sari-making factory in Rampur. On the other hand, Ram Kishen has these great industries! Lord, let my daughter marry his youngest son, Vinod. And she inherits one third of the property! She will have servants around her! And she'll live like a queen! We've bought sweetmeats from all the famous places. That's not fair. You always get so many sweets each time you come! Just a little. Only fortasting. That's the spirit! Excuse me but everybody in Rampurworships Ram Kishen. He's done so much forthe village! Built colleges and hospitals! Now he's building a big factory that will enhance the village. Vivek too has worked hard on it. Mother, he is the lamp of the family! He loves his brothers so much! He trained Prem in business and sent him abroad. Forfurther studies. And now... He's preparing Vinod for business. So Vinod now helps Vivek? Helps? He just carries his briefcase. So what? That's how Prem started. lsn't that so, Vivek? Prem does that even today. Prem has come. - He's here? Mother... - Go away. Mother is annoyed because you didn't come home in the last vacation. l'll get her round. Where there's laughter on the dining table.. Where the ladies and girls of the family lovingly feed us... That truly is a home! Here's yourfavourite porridge. You neverfed us with such love. We only have an aunt. Here you are, baby. Take this too. Piping hot samosas. Serve me one too. -You too will have? l preferthe spicy to sweet. Some more tea? What about you? - No. What? Go on. Serve him. What a scene! Better get used to it. She's going to feed you all your life. Where are you going? Sit down! Mumu baby! Where are you? There they come! Congratulations, queen mother! Brother-n-law! Congratulations! l can understand that you call yourfriend Mumu out oflove. But how does he become your brother-in-law? The husband of ourfriend is our brother-in-law! You are great! You've come so late! Last night we had such a game of cards in the club.. ...that it ended at 4 AM and you know we can't wake up early. They wake up late and stay here till very late! There are fights in every family these days! Fights between brothers, parents, between mother and daughter-in-law! l think the moment sons get married, they should be separated. Separate homes, work. That's it. That's the duty of parents today. - l don't agree. The joy you can get together is impossible living alone. Man can overcome any problem ifhis family is united. Breaking up disperses the energy. Think of the children. Why should the grandchildren be deprived of the love of grandparents? Absolutely. The duty of parents is... ...to inculcate the right values from childhood. So they can share each others' joys and sorrows in togetherness. Would you like to bet on it? Don't you have to get ready? My discussion with Ram Kishen will continue. Now we have to get dressed. See you in the evening. Thank you brother. Tell the lawyer, see you. You really have strange friends. They always talk ofbreaking homes never bonding families. But it is true that the importance of relationships is lost today. ln such times, yourfamily and the love you share.. lt is an exemplary guiding light. Mother, his entire life is exemplary! My sister, Mamta has supported you ably on this journey. lsn't it? - Definitely. What did l have when Mamta married me? Loneliness and a year old Vivek in my arms. There's no comparison to the love Mamta has showered Vivek. Do you know what gift l presented to your sistertoday? l've given her a promise. The day l see the faces of my three daughters-in-law.... All my time will be hers. The moments ofjoy l couldn't give her because of my duties.. ...will all be hers. When do we hearthe wedding march for Vivek's wedding? l pray forthat day. We received many proposals but because of Vivek's arm... Those matches? Not one was worthy of Vivek! Yes, man is recognised by his heart not his physical being. And we will find somebody who will value his golden heart. Come in, dear. How are you? - Fine. Sadhna, this is Vivek. Ram Kishen's eldest son. My daughter, Sadhna. Welcome. Mr. Adarsh is very respected industrialist of our city. He has just settled here after establishing business abroad. We've come quite close these days thanks to association meetings. This farwe only met in meetings. You have honoured us by inviting us for a family function. My daughter, Sadhna. Live long. Nobody can tell that you grew up abroad. An lndian is an lndian wherever he be, isn't it? This is Prem, the second son. And this is Vinod, the youngest and the most mischievous! What do you think of the decoration? Beautiful. - She's done it all. What colour selection! What flower arrangement! Ladies love flattery but only from the heart. lsn't it, Sadhna? - That's the problem with ladies! Eitherway you're in hot soup. Raju, Bablu, l'll give you a tip. You can neverwin with ladies. - Then why do you fight them? Hear! Brother, you are an angel! And you're human. Learn from committing mistakes. You must have one sweet at this. At least one. What about yourfamily members? - Only Papa and me. How nice a family can be with siblings and parents... l realise that only today. Ram Kishen and his wife have our blessings today. May they always smile together. Just a minute. And now l request Ram Kishen.. He must say something in his exclusive style for his wife! l love you very much. You have to repeat the words you just said thrice a day all your life! Now it's yourturn. No...! -What? You have to speak. Come here. l... l love the children very much! lt's done! - Come on. Why are you so worried? lt is a worrying matter! What did Adarsh say on the phone? He's coming here for some urgent business. But we met yesterday. And why does he want sister-in-law to be present? You are not aware ofbusiness deals. He will first give you gifts, flatteryou. Then he'll get Ram Kishen to do his work. Why are you getting crazy? He's a real gentleman. Mr. Adarsh is here. Welcome. He's already here! Last evening we had the opportunity to come close to yourfamily. Frankly speaking, yesterday l saw how love can make a home a temple. l come here today with a desire in my heart. Honour me by accepting my daughter's hand foryour son Vivek. l came here with Sadhna only with this dream. So that she meets you, Vivek and the family. After meeting all of you, my daughter is no longer mine. She has changed totally. Please accept her. Where are you going? - To get sweets for all. That's great! Then it's fixed! What are you thinking of?. l'm amazed at the forms in which God comes to spread happiness. We've heard everything. l'm so elated today! Why are you thinking of this? Sadhna and herfather know about your arm. There's a difference between knowing and being togetherfor life. We have no right to play with somebody's life. Your arm will be better someday. Swear by Allah.. - Only on the hope.. We can't snatch somebody's joys. l don't want to keep her in the dark. l've written everything to her in a letter. l hope she understands. And will marry somebody else! Listen to him! Sent her a letter! He talks like a kid! Talk some sense into him! You don't know women. She doesn't fear darkness. When she makes up her mind.. She lights the lamp of trust in her heart. She adorns her hairwith it. Yes brother. We took your letterthere. And brought the answer back. Hello. -Welcome. Stretch your hand to accept the bride. When we were abroad, l'd wonder with little Sadhna in my lap... How should l teach her our culture? But l saw l didn't have to make any efforts. Automatically she imbibed all those qualities. Today l know why. She had to bind a cord to your family. Go, my child. To your house. Sister-in-law... This is Anurag and Jyoti. Anand's brother and his wife. Be happy. Congratulations, Vivek. Jyoti really takes care of Sangita. Like a little sister. - She is worth it. Both my kids only stay with her. Come and take her blessings. Bravo! All the young members of the family must touch herfeet. The first is Vinod. Where is he? Call Vinod. -All right. You...? - l've come to see you. To see me? Uncle has called foryou! lf we keep meeting like this, someday you'll fall in love. Touch your sister-in-law's feet. -We have a different tuning. Touch herfeet. Can't straighten my back! -What acting! Prem, come on. - Go on, son. One moment. How can he touch herfeet? He's elderto her. Prem is youngerto Vivek so she is elderto him in relation. l am here, on the way. Are you elder oryounger to brother Vivek? -Why? We have to fix your relation with her. What's my age? -Whatever it be... You are elderto me in every form. No, dear sister-in-law! You can't escape this bond. He's loved Vivek more than a brother. To tell the truth, he's handing over his Vivek to you today. Father...! Now reduce yourtrips here. Yourfriend belongs to her. And the world is yourfoe. Excuse me, but l'm one of the shameless ones! l'm not going to let go so easily. Sister-in-law whetheryou treat me as your own or not... You are stuck with me! Brothers and sisters... The eldest daughter-in-law in our nation is welcomed with love. This function of today.. ...is to welcome the bride home! Come...Come on! Welcome, to be sister-in-law. Where were you all this while? - Blushing away. Wondering if Prem is here. Don't be silly. He's hiding somewhere, scared of you! Aren't you ashamed to make fun ofbrother Prem? You're no less! All said and done, you really trapped Prem with the picture joke! And trapped him so beautifully! l overheard the elders talk. Tomorrow they've planned a prayer and Prem's engagement to Preeti! You're getting engaged today! Dress up, look smart. Why the tension, little guy? Mummy, he is all dressed. l think your dearest son has some deep worries. Stop reading and get up. Sadhna, put the necklace round his neck. lt's the right of a sister-in-law. Now tell us, why are you silent? What can l say? - Motherwants to know if you're happy You should have asked Preeti once. ls she happy? What's the matter? This is why l'd advised you to send him to a co-ed school! Quiet. Sadhna, you convince him. Silly boy! Let's go. A girl talks through her eyes. Since yesterday ecstasy brims overfrom Preeti's eyes. Lift your eyelids and look at yourselfin the mirror. You look magical! Praise to Lord Satyanarayan! Here is the engagement ring. Prem, slip the ring on herfinger. Wow! Why are you calling Mummy? - Get out ofher apron strings now! She is waiting. From today, Preeti is officially ours Good, you take overthe tension. l can't guarantee what kind of housewives, doctors turn out to be. But they make good daughters. You've given us too much! - lt's hardly anything. We're grateful that Anurag could give us so much time. We had to come. l'm asking you forthe last time. Will you come with us or stay with aunt? You've wielded magic on them! That's enough... - Bye, brother. This is what Rampur looked like 15 years ago. We'd go to the village during every vacation. He was very fond of photography. Drink yourtea! That's our ancestral home. Raghu uncle looks so young! He looks afterthe house. Good day. And those are the little kids. Sister-in-law, recognise them. Ourtrain goes... l'll tell you. This is Vivek. This is Prem. Prem, do you know, you've got thrashed the most from your mother? He was the most stubborn. And that is Sangita! That is Vinod! And who is this, Sapna? ls that me? ls that me, grandma? Sister-in-law, that's Vivek teaching us. All together. Great... Move aside! Repeat after me. Look at the love birds. Brother Prem and Preeti. Who is that? -You tell me. lt's me! There comes Kanhaiya. - Holding on to his dhoti. Dear Vinod! How they would fight at every little thing! And quickly make up. Take a look! What are you doing here? Thinking of your childhood? Time flies by so fast, isn't it? How long does it take fortime to go by? You've just about come and will leave tomorrow morning. We meet just once a year. The rest of the time, we laugh and even cry. ls that so? - l have a request. Don't remove the childhood love from your heart. Wheneveryou think of me, pray that we meet soon. Wow! What a thought! May l ask you something? You won't be offended? l'm sitting here only to talk to you oflove. You might as well say it. The way you joke with me from childhood to date... You talk of this and that. ls it nothing special or is there something...? What do you mean? Nothing. What would you say if l ask you this same question? l asked you first. What was the question? - Think of the question all night. And answer me in the morning. Listen... When will it be morning? Get up... Sorry, l'm late! Grandma, you're leaving so early? Stay for awhile. Unlike you, the train is bang on time, not a minute late. l'll go and drop them to the station. You keep sleeping. Brother and l are going. Grandma... Grandma.. Papa is absolutely right. One must get up early or half the jobs get left undone. l accept that... lf you've understood that, hearthis too... The jobs not done today will be completed tomorrow. Each morning gets a ray of sunshine when it comes. l must note this down. Prem, show the bride the office. Come on. This room is of us brothers. - That's Vivek's table. That is Prem's and this is Vinod's. Sit here, on big boss Vivek's chair. What will you have? - Get some juice... Let's have a party! Let Vivek come. We have to discuss something important. l'll just... - Come on, brother! Yes, what seems to be the problem? You've barely been married for 2 days and you've joined work! People generally go out aftertheirwedding. Where will you take your wife foryour honeymoon? One minute. Whereverwe go, we'll all go together. How crazy! What will the others do on your honeymoon? How else can we all be together? lf you agree, we'll make a program or... No, don't cancel it! We're not tagging along. -Yes, he's taking us! That's good. All of you children must go out. You too, Preeti. What do you say? At least say, yes! You're the only one who won't come. -Why? He hasn't gone to his shop forthe past three weeks. Forget it! You've forgotten you're going on a tourwith the band. ls he a friend or my enemy? All right, this time you win and l lose. Tell me where you want to go. l'll get the tickets. Tell us! -Just a minute. She'll tell us. Shall we go to Rampur? Say that once again. Shall we go to Rampur? Welcome, Vivek. We've been waiting foryou since morning. Really? We're waiting to welcome you with the flowers for ages... Honest? -Absolutely! All the way here, l had the answer to your question memorised in my heart l didn't know, l wouldn't need to say a single word. Both of us have been tied together in a bond. Where can you go? Come on, kids. Have some fresh guavas! You'll find a lot of Rajasthani colour in our attire and speech. My heart is overjoyed to see you. What are you explaining to her? She has lived abroad. l'm introducing herto the village. l've heard that people in the cities are so busy... They don't have time to eat meals in peace. That is why people from cities come to the village for holidays. They get peace of mind here. Grandma, we've left those lanes far behind. But excuse me, what's left in this village? Neither planes come here nor mobile phones. There's a shortage of electricity! We've left the electricity way behind We're going for a walk. Coming. Come on. -You go ahead. l'll help the ladies in the kitchen. You too were supposed to go forthe walk. Who said? -You said so a while ago. You've reformed.. - No... Shall we..? Come on! Brother! Elder brother! We came for a walk but here we're running! Shall we return? -Just a little further. l want to show Prem how far the factory has progressed. Prem, come on. Come on. This is the site. Production will begin in a few months. Can we check the progress of the factory from close quarters later? l'm feeling terribly cold! Okay, we'll sit here for sometime. Won't Papa be terribly happy when the factory is operational? What are you thinking of?. - Nothing. l think he's starving. Go for a run. l have to talk to Prem about something. Talk to him at home. After breakfast. Which way do l go? Not this way, it's all uphill. This way is better. What's the matter? Brother... When you see poverty and difficulties around you... Helplessness writ large on the faces of people... Don't you then feel... What is all this for? Sometimes l feel my education, my Masters Degree... Everything seems futile. We can't run away from the truth. Will yourthinking diminish somebody's sorrow? lf you want to share their sorrow... Do something that will bring joy to their lives. Look at this plant. When it is operational.. This place will always have power. This is Papa's dream. Forthe progress of this village. Forthe future of those kids who will be me and you tomorrow. You have a lot to do in life. Study hard. At this point this is your only duty. Yes, you do have another duty. Towards Preeti. A girl gives up everything foryou. She behaves the way you'd want her to. ln return, she only asks for a little love. l know you do love her a lot. But you have to express the love in your heart. Bring the words in your heart to your lips. And you'll see how she blooms. Have you guys finished talking? -Yes. Anything serious? l'll talk to you when the time comes. You've made excellent dumplings, sister-in-law! We made them. l had no idea you could cook so well. Prem, now taste this and tell us how it is. No! Please... What's the matter? When we insisted, forthe first time, she made Prem's favourite sweet. And she's feeling shy to serve it. She thinks it's not good enough. Prem will certify whether it's good or not. Serve him. Just a second. The video too is ready. How is it? - Good. Good or very good? Very good. - Then take some more. l will. - Here you are! Brother's face is as red as the sweet! l am feeling shy! Don't be so conscious. l'm taking your photo with them. Speak in ourtongue. Prem, put the picnic bags in the bus. The sweet dish was very good. l was making it forthe first time l feared whetheryou'd like it. You must make it again. Stop riding and come here. We're discussing the love life of a king who lived 1000 years ago. Look at that... - So how many queens did he have? 100. Let's go to the umbrella. See how lucky he was! l swear! Had it been me... And this is the palace of the queens. They say, the youngest queen was the most beautiful one! She'd sing in her melodious voice among herfriends. And dance too. Hearing the sound of their music and their anklets... Hundreds of peacocks would dance here with them. Do they still come here? The sky is overcast with clouds. Beautiful ladies stand before us. How can the poor peacocks escape? Continue the romance. Look at that. What is it? Peacock? - No, elephants. Elephant? Prem is a different kettle of fish. Sometimes he rides horses. Otherwise he gets elephants. Come, l'll take you for an elephant ride. Come on, kids. Come here sister-in-law. - l'm going ahead. Preeti, sit here. Have fun! Give her a hand. Everybody be seated. Sit down. Where do l go? - Come here. Everybody hold hands. Take me carefully. l mustn't fall down. l haven't even got engaged. My friend, the elephant. Praise be Lord Ganesha. Look at the peacock! Where is it? - There! How beautiful! Yes, truly beautiful! The moon light night is beautiful! lt's bright outside. Only we don't have current. How can that be? l'll take a look. The current is back? -What do you think? l'll just be back. Welcome! My dearfellow, congratulations on your daughter's engagement. What are you doing? We've come to ask you foryour child's hand. Mummy and Papa are here. They're asking foryou. - l won't go! Strange! You're getting engaged today and look at you.. Tease me, go on. You're the one who spread the tale of the fuse off! Everyone is laughing! What will Mummy and Papa think? Mummy was really mad at you. Said nobody in the family behaved like you! l'm dead! l'll say it was your idea. -Want to kill me? Tell them the light went offby chance. Please, my Moms! Come on. Good Lord! The light went offby chance. - Really? lt wasn't my fault. lsn't it? Brother and his wife are to be blamed. They said, get engaged. So l said, all right. lt finishes one job. - Oh, l see. Come on, Mummy. Hear Sapna talk abut his exploits. Come here. Why are you sitting there with the old guys? Come here. Only waiting foryou. You will first have a son followed by a daughter. Congratulation. What formula is this? - lt's simple. lf the ring is straight, it will be a son. lfit spins, it will be a girl. And ifit doesn't spin, full stop. What a scientific method! He's fond of reading from various sources and using it to impress. Man should view every new thing with curiosity. And it was true in our case. Preeti, now it's yourturn. Come on, show your hand. Now everybody is interested. You'll just have a sweet little boy. Happy? Yes, now it's yourturn. Son.. Daughter. Son. Daughter. Son. Daughter. Son. Daughter. Son. Daughter... l've had it! l was pulling your leg. Give me your hand. - l won't. Why? -What's this? Do you have to return today? What has cropped up that Anurag has called you today? lt must be important or brotherwouldn't have called. Today we were planning a picnic to the factory site. We won't enjoy without the kids. We'll plan anothertrip after Prem and Vinod get married. Papa, we'll all go together. By then the seat next to your should be full. l've fixed my program with sister-in-law. When they will be three, we will be two. We'll take leave. lt's time. We didn't realise how these days flew by in games and laughter. 30 years ago, l left this village with a dream. l wanted to do something so that the villagers wouldn't have to... ...leave theirfamilies and go farforwork. Today l see that dream taking shape. Brother and Bhaijaan are waiting for us at the site. We'll go there. Let's go to work. - Shall we stay here? We're all waiting forthe factory to be inaugurated. The moment the plant is inaugurated we'll hearthe wedding bells. The date forthe wedding matches this perfectly. Now we're just waiting forthat auspicious date. And l hand overthe business to my sons and be carefree. l've decided to hand charge of the company, the directorship to Vivek. l'd made her a promise. Once our sons are married, all my time will be hers. So the daily appointments dairy will be with her? You will be burdening Vivek with a huge responsibility. He deserves it every way. Wow! What news! Congratulations! You don't understand anything! lf Vivek becomes the company managing director.. Adarsh will be one up on us! That is true. -What will our sons-in-law have? They will always have to obey Vivek. They will have to beg him for every little thing! What shame in asking your elder brother? Power can corrupt. Family relations are forgotten. This concerns our daughters too. You are very good friends. Do something and stop this from happening. Take the wife into confidence. -Why? The minds of women work better in this regard. Don't worry. Follow me. We don't understand your making Vivek the MD. Why? - ls this fairto us? With Vinod and Prem? Such an important announcement and you simply said it. No party, no celebration. Just these dry potato dumplings with chutney! Dharmraj is most upset about this. That is why he has decided that tomorrow before we leave fortown.. He will distribute Jaipur sweetmeats to the village! Why did you have to do this? May the Lord always be kind to you. My good fellow, everybody is blessing you forthis! All of you are leaving. We will be left alone. That is why we leave Sapna with you. Orwe'd take her along. Next time, l'll bring him along. He'll stay here for a few days to learn the work. l'll come here to work but not make small talk. lfl get the time... When do you leave for your studies abroad? Tomorrow night. Here are the sweets and savories. Keep them in the bag. l didn't make them. Did you..? Preeti made them. Don't you dare distribute them amongst friends! When will you return? How can l say? Only till the exams. Then he'll be with you. Write a love letterto mother everyday instead of to Preeti. You spoke again! - The flight is on time. Hurry up. You come here, l'll show you! Shall we leave? You may stay. This is very good. Going on a world trip with yourwife. You'll have Prem's company on the flight. You're keeping the promise you gave yourwife. And l'm keeping mine. Leave this veil behind for some days. She'll wear jeans abroad. Come here. Sit with Papa today. l had to make an important phone call. Try to understand the important phone call after engagement! This will be a daily occurrence. Did you decide the colourforyour room? Prem, let us your choice too. l have to make rooms for both of you before your marriages. Vinod has given me a long list. You too must tell me. What can l say? As Preeti wishes. He has really changed. l'll just say this. All three boys should have similar rooms. They are the same. Vivek's is up stairs and Prem and Vinod are down. They too should have rooms upstairs. Why shouldn't they get a garden view? Laterthese are the issues that will create fights between them. She's laughing. Uncle is here. - Good day to you. Welcome. Since when do you have this ailment? Excuse me, l think l'm going through a bad phase. Get them in. l've brought some sweets forJanmashtami, from Agra. Pass them here! You are ourfavourite relative from all the three! Call Papa in the office and tell him brother is here. Don't disturb him in work. l've come to meet sister. First of all do something for us. Shouldn't Vivek, Vinod and Prem get equal shares? What can l say in family matters? You have all the rights. You're giving your daughter! -Yes. That's right. You get after every little thing! Excuse me. Sangita here. l've been thinking of you since morning. How are the kids? -All fine. Are you feeling all right? Yes, is Vivek home? - He's in the office. l'll talk to him there. Nothing special. Bye. Don't worry. Give the line to Anand. Something important cropped up. We'll discuss this later. l don't know what exactly happened between Anand and Anurag. But Sangita and Anand are quite worried. They have called me there. Why are you crying? What's the matter? You are aware that we have been a tight knit family. Brother Anurag, Jyoti, Sangita, me and the three kids. We've had no ill feeling. Since Anurag called us from Rampur.. He seemed changed. l thought it was tension of work. But yesterday he called us and said... We must look for a separate business. A separate home. Anurag said that? l can't believe it. lt is true. After doing computer engineering my work has been technical. Brother looked afterthe company accounts and finances. When he transferred the company property and shares to his name.. We didn't realise it. Tell me, did yourfather make a will? No, uncle. - Then forgive me.. Your brother has no legal right to grab everything! We can go to court and stake a claim in everything! You will get your right! No, uncle. - No? The work that father started with such love and efforts... l don't want to drag it to court. And then how can l fight my brother? This concerns your life. Life can be started again. We thought we'd shift to Bangalore. lt has a growing computer industry. l have friends there. l'll begin a new project. That's not so simple. And you have the responsibility of Sangita and Radhika. That's the only thought that makes me nervous. Then l called Vivek. When he was in agreement with my decision.. l took Anurag's blessings and left. Did we take the right decision? We're all proud of you. The only sad part is... The family is broken. They will be one again. Absolutely. l'm confident. Come here, baby. Come to me, child. l'm very worried. How will Anand establish his work alone in a new city? There's no need to worry. l just spoke to Mr. Richard. He's our agent in London who also deals in computers. He wants Anand to join him and look afterthe South lndia business. And there's no problem about accommodation there. l have a flat there. Sangita can be comfortable. Vinod and l will leave for Bangalore today itself. We'll return only after settling them. Considerthese difficult times a test. You'll see there's some good hidden in this too. Take this, my dear. - May l take two more? Sure. Here. One for Raju and the otherfor Bablu. l'll give it when we meet. Radhika will miss Raju and Bablu a lot. Shall we leave? Yes brother. See you Mummy. Take care dear. l'm very worried. -Why? What happened to Anand shouldn't happen to us. l don't understand.. l've come here from Rampur only to explain this to you! Ram Kishen is appointing Vivek the Managing Director. That's good. But in the future if there's a misunderstanding between the brothers? What he means is, getting charge of the business like Anurag if Vivek... ...blesses Vinod and Prem and sends them out of the house. Vivek loves his brothers more than his own self! Excuse me but the most loving man changes on getting power. You sang praise of Anurag. What happened? Truthfully speaking, l couldn't bearto see Sangita's sad face. The thought brings tears to my eyes! The ones whose children played in Sangita's lap... Played with Mumu..They did this! With the real brother! lf a real brother could do this, don't forget Vivek is a step brother! You can't deny the truth! Yes, today Anand is facing such problems. He called Vivek to advise him about what to do. And what did Vivek do? Tell me the truth, ifhe really had the heart of a brother.. Would he leave his sister mid stream? He would fight, do anything! He'd get her, her rights! He wouldn't wash his hands offhis sister's responsibility. You and your husband are very generous. You bore your daughter's sorrows with a smile. But if this same thing happens to Prem or Vinod... Pritam and l won't be able to bearthis sorrow. We've given our daughters to you. Now their joys and good fortune lie in your hands. What are you doing? Warning you. Vinod will fight and have his way. But what about Prem? Don't we all know him? He's way apart from worldliness. At least think ofhim. Your husband's dream is great. The entire family lives together happily! But is it possible? Can two brides live togetherwithout fighting? Show me one house. - Don't forget... The man who runs the office, his wife rules the home. ln the future if Sadhna doesn't make Preeti and Sapna ... dance to hertune.. l'll eat my words. ln your shoes l would never hand the family to Vivek and Sadhna! The truth is however much you may love Vivek and Sadhna.. He is not your own! He is not your blood! Yes Sangita, is everything settled there? l see, Anandbabu has gone to the office with Vivek? And what is little Radhika doing? She's having breakfast. Here, talk to her. Grandpa, l'm drinking milk by myself. l too am drinking milk. How did you land there? - For goodies made by my daughter. ln fact, l suggest you come here with yourwife. l'll talk to her. Talk to him. Vivek and l will return by evening. Finally, the daughter is happy. Mummy hasn't eaten a thing since last night. She seems very worried. Send her breakfast upstairs. l'll talk to her. l just spoke to Sangita. She is happy. No need to worry. Let's go to herfor some days. She will appreciate it. What's the matter? Some otherworry? l don't want Prem and Vinod to go through Anand's experience. What do you mean? Why are you appointing Vivek the Managing Director? ls that all? Can Vivek evertreat his brothers in this way? Ask your own heart. You know him betterthan l do. l know that this family has 3 sons. lnstead of giving everything to one divide everything between them. What are you saying? lt's not too late. lt will be done with love. And l want it done before Prem and Vinod get married. Do you know what you're saying? Split them up? Separate Vivek, Prem and Vinod? These children are our dreams! You want to break them up? -What dreams are you talking of?. Our daughter has been thrown out ofher own home! Haven't we experienced highs and lows in life? Why are you becoming weak today? This is the time we must stay close and give strength to our daughter. l don't want to argue with you. Forthe first time l'm asking you for something. And l want it. What you want, you're asking for.. is wrong! Breakfast. - l'm not hungry. Mother. l know you are very upset at what happened with Anand and Sangita Yourthinking that this shouldn't happen in ourfamily too is right. But if we split up like this... lf this house is broken into three.. Will we be happy? Think about it. When Sangita comes for rakhi.. To which brother's house will she go first? And we still have to make Vinod's career. His innocence will be stifled in the division ofbusiness. Don't punish everybody for me. Don't break everyone up. l don't want to be the Managing Director. Sadhna and l will go to Rampur. The new plant has to be looked after. We'll stay there. l'll tell Papa to make Prem the Managing Director. l assure you that Prem and Vinod will never suffer as long as l live. Sadhna has brought you dinner. Eat a little. For our sake. Come on, mother. What are you saying? Both of you will go to Rampur! Yes, Vinod. What's wrong with it? Prem will look after everything here. And Rampur is not far. Just a few hours away. All right then. lf you have decided to go.. And Mummy is happy about it.. Then l too will go with you! No, Vinod.. - Nobody will go anywhere! Nobody will go anywhere. May l come in, sir? -Yes, come in. Have you brought all the papers? Give it anotherthought. No, Khan. The time for separation is here. There is no need. Sadhna and l are leaving for Rampurtoday. You won't go anywhere! l've given my word to mother. Mother, we're leaving. Vinod insists of coming along. l'll send him back soon. l'd also like to say this... Why this is happening? The reason behind it.. People will ask us. Don't keep a load on your heart. No motherwill wish ill for her son. Forgive me, father. l hurt you. Silly boy. Do the words of a son hurt a father? You are going. Go. l won't stop you. Emulate every quality of your brother. Only the fortunate are blessed with such a son and brother. What can l tell you? We brought her home with such splendour. lsn't it? Excuse my saying this but this is the law of the world. Gradually bonds break up. The times you spend together are yours l'm glad you are keeping yourselfbusy with work. l've studied all the papers. Begin work on the electricity division. From today Vinod will join me at the factory site. How do you feel now? What's wrong? - Nothing, grandma. Exhaustion, l guess. Don't make Vinod work too hard. That he will have to do. He should have full knowledge of production before the inauguration. So he can return and take training in finance and sales. l won't go back. l won't leave you and sister-in-law. What rain! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law.. They have returned. How are you, Vinod? How was the first day at the site? - Don't ask! Today l realise how hard brotherworks! l'm starving! Have a wash. Dinner is ready. Go and call the little sir. What happened? He's dozed off. - That's because he worked hard today. How sweet is the smile on his face. The smile has returned to his face. But l fear...when Prem returns.. How will l assure him? l think we have talked about it. Yes. Prem returns today. Don't spoil our mood by repeating the same thing. Kindly leave us alone. l want to talk to my sister. l don't have anything left to say to you. The only sorrow is.. Today l have no face left to meet Ram Kishen's eyes. On whose instigation did you do this? These butterflies? Those who never settled down, can't teach us to run our homes! They only want to watch the scene! They will end the play here and go elsewhere forthe curtains! l am a lawyer. l've seen families bickering, relationships breaking up. l can only say that nobody has been happy breaking theirfamilies. Nobody can be happy. See foryourself! Your Prem has gone straight to meet Vivek! lnstead of coming to see you! This is not possible. Why not? Son, we will return with you and Sadhna, We've shared so many moments ofhappiness with this family. l won't let it be overcast be clouds of sorrow! Today is such a happy day. We hear Sadhna's giving us good news. Accompany Prem even if only to share this good news! Adarsh, you tell Vivek. l understand your feelings and Prem's too. Nobody would be happierthan me if Vivek & Sadhna return to the fold. But Vivek's silence says a lot. Vivek is doing his duty. You do yours. Ram Kishen and the business needs you Aunt, it is Ram Kishen's values... ...that two brothers today fight for each others' happiness. All you brothers are the same. One heart beats in all three chests. Forthe first time l've seen you brothers fighting. The one we fight with... we love him the most. Listen to me, Prem. Go back before l become weak. The little fellow too is here. How are you? We're going to become uncles. You the elder one, me the younger. Rosogollas from the sweetmeat shop. The first one is for Uncle. Bought specially foryou. - No, l won't eat today. Why? -Just don't feel like it. Not even one? -Just half... Have one. l'm glad though away, we are together. You don't talk to Prem. We'll talk to him. Sounds like him! Did you call for me? -Yes, son. Come inside! Come in and sit down. Whateveryour mother did, good or bad... lt's foryour good and Vinod's. A mother gambles all that she has for her children. So don't be mad with your mother. l say, what has she done? Since she heard, Sadhana is giving us good news... We've been spreading joys! We're distributing saris to all the ladies in Club. And this silver present for all friends and relatives. What else is required? Even a real motherwouldn't do this. May l leave? Everything will remain the same. Nothing here is the same. Neitheryou nor me. See what Vivek has written to me. Today Prem has become he Managing Director. Stay with him all day. Close to him. He has never measured relations with money. We always considered his simplicity his weakness. Actually that is his strength. Give him lots oflove. May l ask you something? When the elder brother's love and father's blessings are with you.. Why don't you sit on your chair? Why here..? This is elder brother's right. Whenever he returns, whichever day.. He'll find everything the same. You worry for no reason. lt will take Prem time to realise. We achieved what we wanted. Prem has become the Managing Director! You just make his favourite dishes and feed him yourself. We'll see how long the son will be mad with the mother. Bye bhaijaan. You haven't eaten a thing since morning. Eat something now. Yes bhaijaan. Wash up and come. Dinner is ready. No, mother. l'm not hungry. All yourfavourite dishes. l made them. l'm not hungry. l've shifted yourthings to the room upstairs. Where are you going? To bring my things back from Vivek's room. You and Preeti have to stay here after marriage. How did you even think ofit? The entire fault is mine! l'm to be blamed! l love you so much! Fight the world foryou! Doesn't a mother have this right? She does. Only if she doesn't differentiate between the kids. l didn't do anything. Vivek left on his own. And you let him go? Tomorrow ifl want to leave everything and go away.. Will you let me go? Won't you stop me? Right from childhood, Vivek has respected you more than us. He has loved you the most. And you forgot all this! Try to recall. The Prem and Vinod forwhom you're fighting yourself.. They would have left you and gone away long back! lf Vivek hadn't lost his arm to save their lives! Forwhat happened to Sangita, you're blaming brother Vivek. Thinking of Sangita brings tears to our eyes. The name of Anurag fills us with anger. But are we less at blame than Anurag? The Sadhna whom we lovingly brought home as a bride.. We made her a stranger in a moment! When she waits at the foot steps of motherhood! lsn't this discrimination? You've acted as a step-mother, not Vivek! Nobody can take the place ofbrother Vivek and Sadhna. Neither in this house nor in this room. Nor in this heart. And if your condition is that l step into Vivek's shoes... and Preeti into Sadhna's... l swear by Sadhna, l will never get married! Uncle, forgive me. l can't get married. l knew this would be your decision. The country that honours the brother as a father and his wife as mother.. Prem will never crush their joys to erect his own palace of dreams. l knew it. l had already told Preeti. Won't you stay? l wouldn't have been able to take Sadhna's rights even if you asked me. Sit down. Whetherwe're tied in a bond or not.. We're tied in an emotional bond ofhearts. lsn't it? Don't worry about Sadhna. Her delivery is my responsibility. lt will be a normal delivery. Careful. You might have to go to the hospital any moment. Sit down. - See what father sent foryou. A little Krishna. He wants you to always keep this idol in front of you. Give it to me. -Why are you staying here? Sapna is here. - l've taken official leave from sir. l'm going to stay here till you deliver. Tea... Doctor, Preeti is staying here leaving all herwork. And Sapna isn't taking part in her college cultural program. l have three daughters not one. Vinod will complete training by the time the factory is inaugurated. Then we'll send him back to the city. Time just flew by laughing with Sapna. We didn't realise anything. Time moves at its' own pace. Time takes its' tests all the time in some way. l don't understand! Why has production in the factory stopped? We faced technical problems earliertoo! Sir, Anand could tackle them. l've heard this a number of times. Quickly appoint a good engineer. ln this manner, we won't be able to clearthe bank loans! l'm on my way. Now how are they? They still have high temperature. Jyoti mentioned that they haven't been eating well for some days. They've stopped playing too. Yes. -Anyway continue the medicines. lnform me tomorrow morning. l have to talk to you. l want to say something to you as yourfamily doctor. Children are as delicate as flowers. lf they don't find a loving environment, they wither away. And that's not good. l'm unable to give them time because of my problems at work. l often lose my temperwith them. Yesterday you raised your hand at them They were being stubborn. They wanted to go to Anand and Sangita. Why don't you give in to them? Don't lose the peace of your family to personal grudges. Or no doctorwill be able to help. Anand and his wife have come! With Radhika! Brother! You didn't inform us that Raju and Bablu were so ill. We left as soon as sister-in-law called up. You didn't consider us family. Forgive me. Forgive me. What are you saying? l had turned blind with selfishness. l achieved one success after another in business. l assumed it was because of me. But after Anand left, l found out the success wasn't mine. But of ourteam. Since Anand left home, without asking ortaking anything.. l haven't had any peace. l lost everything l had. The happiness of the children. The smile on Jyoti's face. But we're together again! We will live together. Today is such a joyous day. My daughter's house is settled again. We've come to ask you for something. Ask brother Vivek to return home. lt was Vivek's belief that we'll be together again. l rememberthe day we were leaving for Bangalore... He placed his hand on my head and said... All your sorrows be mine May all my joys be yours. l've committed a grave sin! A grave sin! Nothing is lost. Look there. No, Mamta. You are the same Mamta for me. ...who gave our children such a noble upbringing. Made them such good humans. Shall we go to Rampur? We are going to be grand parents. Yes, Sadhna needs you the most at this hour. Anything to worry about? - No, Sadhna is fine. Start the final testing of the machines. We're off to the hospital. Brother is here! - Hurrah! Congratulation! You've become a Papa! -You have a son! Many congratulations. You..? - Talk later. Sangita, take him in. Let's go. Mother... l've come to take my daughter-in-law and grandson home. l won't take him. You left. Not once did you ask your mother... What is my fault? Attention! The heirto the family is making his entry! Give the baby to me! - No! l'm the aunt! - No! lt's the Papa's turn first. No, first of all it's the turn of Papa's Mummy. Aunt, compared to all the joys of the world.. The joy ofbecoming a grandmother is the best. Mother, all of us are in line to meet the baby. Me, first. - Sure. Aunt before the uncle. Let's love him together. lt's also the right of the elder uncle and aunt to love the baby. Yes, Prem. One day for my sake... You took a pledge in front of mother. Today for my sake l want you, You take another pledge. Garland her. Here is your Mummy! Okay, you may... - l have garlanded her. Sister-in-law, on this joyous occasion l've brought special sweets! You really do too much! Forgive me for all that l did so farwas with ulterior motives. Blinded by love for my daughter. l fed flourto the ants, watered the god of the trees. Prayers, invocation.. -Yes, l did all that. But l couldn't shake the foundation of yourfamily. Mother Ram Kishen is right. lt's all a game of values.
