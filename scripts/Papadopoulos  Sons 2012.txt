Must've used Euphemismus, for Greek waiter isn't he? Only joking Harry. He then started the now famous Papadopoulos & Sons, doing all things Greek. From Taramasalata to olive oil and Frozen-Moussaka. Which I must admit my wife and I are a partial to in occasion. Not one to settle, Harry's made the move in to comercial property. Where he's about to embark on one of the most audacious development yet. Papadopoulos Plaza. A 2 Million square foot redevelopment in the heart of our great city. Ladies and gentelmen, I give you European Entrepeneur of the year: Harry Papadopoulos. That's lovely. Now, stood out a bit for me. Yeah that's nice.

Dave, I need to talk to you about James. It's a... look, you really should be doing that out in the back! Yeah, sorry. Look, it's a.. He needs to complete his degree. And this.. ...gardening, the hortyculture, the plants... Yeah yeah. It's a huge distraction. I was just opening my own show the older days Yeah well, I need him to study, and you're diverting his attention. And frankly it's not what I pay you for. Please don't be so childish. You know, if you work for my company, you probably be fired Yeah. Is anything else? - No, that's it. Good night, Mr. Papadopoulos. James? Relax. Calm down. You need to learn how to... You really need to learn how to express your self more calm.. Wanker. Wanker! James, can I come in? "It's not the strongest to survive nor the most intelegent, but those adaptable to change." Facinating. Charles Darwin. Aw, look at that! And that's... Did you know, that the average garden contains over 3,5 million species? No, I didn't. Dad, I'm not going back to... But it's only a year, and then you got a law degree. I have no intention of running... Papadopoulos & Sons. I can't even pronounce it. - Look.. Finish your studies. The plants, it's a hobby sure. Give your self options, you may change your mind about the business. You know there're lot of creative borrow now in business. Like what? Like marketing. Alright, differ the far new year. Take a year off. Why not. Fine. But don't quit. Your mother would've said the same. Will she? Well your mother would probably just said do what you feel was right. But I doubt if she was wrong. And then we'd argue probably, and she win. That was your mother. At least consider differing. Ok. I'll consider differing. Yeah? Great. Great. So there you are, it's not a definitely not. What's this one called? - It's an Ivy. Mrs. P? Mrs. P. Look, I'd better... Hey Well done for... You know. Close it? Yes, please. Evening boss, sorry to disturb. I work for homeless charity.

He's a... he works for charity. Is it a cake sale? - Cakes? Did you say cakes? Did he say cakes? How did you know, that's what I wanna do. Open up a cake shop. Cakes! Really? Cup Cakes, individually decorated ginger man, bite size apple strudle, gooey fudge ball, mini-muffins... It's what they sell at traditional fair. Got business plan and everything. It will be egalitarian, but feel... exclusive. So my mission statement really: "Progressive people's cake shop", for progressive pricein'. Very good. I know about a thing or two about food business as well. Really? I'm looking for investors. - Retail's not for me I'm affraid. Staff, nightmare, they'll nick your cake upside your costumer and do you for own food dissmisal. Ah. Thanks for the encouragement. Lets buy something! The news, Daddy! How much for a... Its a shammy. - What ever, how much? Shammy? It's a shammy. I'm not gonna say that word. - Why not? Because its a silly word, and don't know what it's for, and I don't know if you're genuine. And I probably never gonna use it. Oh, a shammy! Come look, Daddy. FTSE hits 3 year low in banks - Turn it up. Panic, confusion and chaos. They said, it couldn't happen again, but today it just did. Sending shockwave... What's screwed? - Another bank collapse. Nicholas. Yeah, I'm watching now. It's insane. A bank is put into liquidation. It comes as a shock... I don't know, why'd you call 'em? Allright, I'll see you first thing tomorow. At least have repercussion on your loan? That's a very good word, Theo. Isn't it? Daddy? "Repercussion." It's a good word. Yes, it's a very good word. I've revalue the property that calling in the guaranties. You need to find 30 Mill now, 6 months to find the rest. And if we don't? What happens? They'll put you and everything you own into administration. Harry you took our crazy loans. Our business is making feta cheese, for Godsake You gambled it on a shopping.... Could really do without these comments. Right now. I'm the finance director of this company, Harry. You never listened. It's always have to be bigger. Better. Like these offices. We didn't need these offices. Do you know how much we paid for that "work of art" up there? Do you? 200 Grand. 200 Grand for a fish. What do you want me to do Nick? - Our business was profitable Harry. I was gonna retire in 2 years. I'd like to bring that forward. You're resigning now? The accountants are coming in. Sorry, Harry Den boro. (I can not) Den boro. Nicholas! - That's enough. It's enough. - Nicholas! Can you believe that. - Hey, Fat Laki! You know why they call this guy Fat Laki? Oh, wow. Well, congratulation. I stoped eating bread. It's sad though. I love bread. But what can you do? This is Sophie, just relocated form my New York office. Hallo, really pleased to meet you. Can I just say I'm a huge fan of Greek food. Specially the cakes. I love the Baklava. Great. Ship's going down and we got Baklava. So I take it the bank supporting the work. What are the bosses proposing? They've demmanded the 300 Million we borrowed. 30 by close of play. Sweet mother of God, they are sons of bitches. They've taken a new position on the value of the property development it's triggered the guaranties. Can you sell it? It's not even a building, it's not yet. So it's bankruptcy? Put something offshore I said. - He wanted to pay his taxes. I bet I should've been more Greek about it. Hey it's bankruptcy baby, not a disaster. Accountants! When it's good they get paid when it's bad they get paid. I want my son to be a lawyer for the same reason. He doesn't get it. So what are the options? Well, the obvious is to buy back your own business. Took us finding the investors to back you. And the bank will sell back to me because..? Because no body make pinks lope like you do Harry. The banks just want a quick sale, they have no interest running your business. Just jump on it. I'll talk to the private equity firms, VCs, angels, the ussual suspects. We'll find some one. What doesn't break you makes you... Ah, Therapy! Don't charge me for that will you. Rob, don't let her charge me for that. They're going through my things, it's disgusting! Hold it darling. rage temper, you'll get it all back Morning. - Oh, hi! Problem. This is the kitchen. - Fabulous furnaces. How long is this gonna take? Most of the day I should think. And what are we allowed to keep? According to the asset sheet let's see. Not very much. Little rats, with their little claws. Quite unnecessary kid. We may as well do this now. Ah, it's a nice computer. Oh, don't worry. We're not gonna you know, take it Now. Anything interresting? - Stocks! Every one's selling, I'm buying. two, four, eight... Double your numbers quitely Theo. And apologise. Although I'll confiscate that wretched computer for a week. Sorry. There's no easy way of doing this. You have impeccable taste by the way - Not mine.

And 1,000 in personal... items. What else? Ah well, one thing that came up in the meeting with the HQ this morning The fish & chips shop. "The Three Brothers"? - What fish & chips shop? Well that went years ago. Well the bank unable to seize it as an asset, because of its co-ownership with a... Spiros Papadopoulos. - Right. Guess that's his brother. But they haven't spoken in years. It was so strange. Oh, James... more lemons, son. This is so good, Mrs. P. In all the year... I've never stoped thinking about you, or your food. Ah, still so charming. Natural. So... I'm sitting there watching the tv. And suddenly I see Papadopoulos & Sons. On the TV. - Daddy ever leverage himself. Look at this little English. Hey! I'm your uncle Spiros, right! I'm your uncle, Remangga! I'm gonna eat you with so beaut. Please don't eat me. He just like his mother. That litlle english man. - That's because my mommy was english. I know that. So, I'm watching the news. And I'm thinking, what's my baby brother gonna undone now? And just at that moment... as I'm thinking that thought, in the same split second, the phone rings, and it's you. I mean, it's gotta be some. kind of quantum physics there. No? No? It's sane. Insane. Katie? You're so grown up. I can't believe this. You were like... just a girl. Dumpy and spoilled. Look at you now. - She's still a little spoilled. Nanny P! - And dumpy. Not so dumpy. Ah, James! Sweet baby James. When you were three... How old was he? Three or four? We used to play fight. Remember? You love to fight. While you blow up my nose! Yeah! Fuck, that hurts. - Spiros! Sorry. Duck, I said duck. Quak, quak. I know what you said. Alright, don't tell your father. Harry, thank you for phone-ning me. Now, seriously. I'm so greatful. There's... I know there's so much for you, we need to sort out you and I. But we should be celebrating. Yeah. I don't drink anymore. Just so you know. But you don't have to be drunk to dance. That's what I say now! You don't have to be drunk to dance! Fantastic. So, look.. we're losing the house. And everything. - What? It's only temporary. I'm in negotiation with top corp. finance team to buy back. But in the mean time I need to free up some capital. I'll give you what ever I got. But you know I don't have much money. I don't want you money Spiro. I wanna sell "Three brothers". We split 50/50. I get enough money to pay the rent, pay few bills off And it's great for you, 'cause you got some cash to do.. what ever it is you wanna.. do. We can't sell the "Three Brothers". - I knew it. I knew it'd be difficult, I knew it, I knew it. I knew it. You haven't changed. - It doesn't feel right. You're loving this. - Oh Harry! I want to help. Can't you see we're in the shit! - Gentlemen, please! May I suggest we sleep on this? Before it gets out of hand. Yeah, this is good advice, Mrs. P. Harry. Harry! - Ok, what ever. I couldn't sleep last night not awake. Over and over in my mind, I was trying to imagine selling the shop. Something here was saying: No. No! I want to help you. All of you. So I pray for guidance. I ask the universe: Please help me. Please help me help these people. And I must've fallen asleep not long after. A crazy sleep. And then this dream. There was this... This music. The most incredible music. And you and me Harry. Running the shop. I woke up with tears in my eyes. And I knew. So, what are we going on about? We're going to re-open the "Three Brothers". Briliant! Is he talking about us? I think he is. - There's nothing there. Exactly! It's empty, useless. We get nothing for it. But if we made the "Three Brothers" great again... Hey! That is our destiny! Ok, it needs work, sure. But Destiny needs work. You're still crazy. We have.... You have a better chance of getting through this if we increase the value of the shop. I'm not opening a fish & chips shop. I'm Papadopoulos & Sons, I'm on supermarket sales. Oh, God. What I would tell my friends? - I don't know, maybe the truth? "I don't know, maybe the truth?" - God, fuck off. F-F-F-fuck you. - Enough! People, hear me out. If we get it up and running again, we can sell it as a going concern. Instead of an empty shop. This deal that you working on, could take ages. In the mean time, you're getting cash in. And you're saving money. Because it's got 2 bed rooms. The "Three Brothers" is a gold mine. Used to be. Can be again. - When did you become so practical? I'll get it fixed. I'm handy man now. Oh, I thought you were a waiter Spiro? Around too much booze, Mrs. P. I went travelling. Belgium, America, Brooklyn. I ended up managing a block of apartments in LA. I do painting, decorating, plumbing, electrics, everything. A man who can fix things. - I've got a van. Oh, it's alright everyone. Don't panic, he's got a van. Lets go look at the shop. Let me go and sub working on it now. You're out of your mind. I know what you're up to. You wanna make some money for yourself. That's fine, it's OK. Atleast you thinking smart these days. But don't involve us in all this. I want to help. - Given the current situation... I think it's worth consideration. What?! I'm not opening a Fish & Chips shop! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! Not! Not! What? May I have a private word?? Now? You're behaving like a child. - Mrs. Parrington, with all due respect.. Your're the father of this family. - I'd rather boy of my own, he can back to chip shop. What a terrible thing to say. Really? He's unreliable Mrs.P, he's iresponsible, he's a talker. He sings, he dance, he plays the bongo drums. He's a waiter. He'll drive us all mad and leave us broke. He seems a fond to me. He doesn't drink anymore. And he wants to help. Moving back to a chip shop will destroy my children's confidence. Seeing you behave like a spoiled little brat will do that perfect. We're gonna smell like Fish & Chips! The children need a home. I dont' give a fink with your snot. Look at you. Everything has to be a drama with you Greeks. Show some guts, young man! So many memories! Are we really going to live in that? I'm trying to find something good. And? No, nothing. Nonsense. You'll love it! We're gonna have a crazy time. We gonna fix this place up. I'm gonna teach you how to do some greek dancing, some singing. We'll fry some good fish, we'll laugh. Good times! Good times! I don't believe it! - What? - The Greeks are back.

The women, young! Making good money. Wasting it. Gambling it, losing it. Happy days! It's a crack den! - Don't worry. Let me show you the rest. We'll make it homely, furniture, beds, tv, come on. Let me show you. So here is the prep room. Where we prepare the fish. There's the living room. Mortimer, Rolf and Jones. Hello? Could I speak to Rob? He's not at his desk. Can I take a message? It's Harry Papadopoulos. Oh, hi. It's Sophie, we met at your office the other day.. Oh, hi. Any news? - We're lining up interest. Right. Well. I um... I just need to know when...

Hello. - Hi Do you have a light? - You came all this way for a light? I'm from Kebab shop across the road. Nice. My dad, wants me to spy on you. I don't think he likes greeks. You wanna go out sometime? Yeah, alright. I'm Mehmet - It's Katie. Shit around here ain't it? Yeah. Pretty much. Catch you later. - Yeah. Bye. Mortimer, Rolf and Jones. Oh, hi Dad! Yeah, I got them.

Some big names. - Pop & Sons is still in the cash count. What's the detential deal structure? - That's the pitcher. You still be key running the business, but... But? - Money isn't cheap Harry. These guys would want the 95% of the company. Leaving me with nothing. I'll do the same thing. I'd be CEO of Papadopoulos & Sons, get a salary, get the house back. My children's future. - Beats Fish & Chips. You'd be working for some one else. - I'd be working for some one else. By the way, I'm not actualy running the Fish & Chips shop. Just helping my brother relaunch. - Sure. Listen, there maybe another way. Came up in conversation with the Norske Velconan Bank. It'll be a long line of a straight loan to buy back the business. Why would they loan to me? Well, it's awesome. Want me to look into it? Sure, no choice. - Okay, cool. Gotta go, got an emergency. Well, get this: A high tech portable toilet company that is litteraly gone down the tubes. An internet ready, wireless crapper, with waterproof keyboards and screen. For the love of God. Because taking a dump needed an overhaul. So, some body's gonna bury 'em. In padre spiritus sanctus ect, ect. Gotta love a down turn. Laters! I think we ecurrently doing with your brother, sounds liberating. I'm liberating myself from my last 25,000 in dissused chip shop. But it's llike a start up. Isn't that the most exciting phase of any venture? Taking a bit of risk, developing your product, and your services. Learning about your market. Look, some of the largest companies on the planet never make a profit. Like a real profit, it's all accounting tricks, and leverage debt. What I'm trying to say is.. Does it matter if the business is a small one, as long as it makes a profit, and the people who work there happy? What are you doing working in a place like this? This is only temporary. I got divorce recently, came to london for a fresh start. I'm actualy looking into setting up my own business. Well, I'm sorry about that. About the divorce I mean. I've been meaning to ask, can I come and visit your shop sometime? There isn't one. - When it's up and running. It's a chip shop. It's hot, on your feet all hours, verbal abuse from costumers on a friday night, I wasn't applying for a job Harry, I just want to stop by. It's late. What are you doing, little man? Trading. I watch trends, making trades based on patterns. I dont' even look at the fundamentals. - Fundamentals? You know, capital employed, gaining ratio, etc. Not even profit or turn over. Short term, but I can spot a trend. I know what's gonna happen. - So you can see the future? And? - Same as the past. But to shot order from chaos. I'm done for today. Ah, Theo, Theo, Theo. Sweet dreams. - Uncle Spiros? You knew my mummy? Yes. She was... beautiful. And she was very kind to me. I wish I had my mummy sometimes. It's very hard for you. I'd make her laugh uncle Spiros. You make me laugh. I'll come out with some classics. Real gems. Wasted on this family. You are something else. We can hear everything. Don't fall for him Spiros, he's a little thinker. Say the magic release poem. - No. Yeah, actualy say the magic release poem. No. Theo Papadopoulos is Hippopotamus He's always making such a fuzz from his toe to lots of us. Ah, your kids. They're something. Don't worry. I'm not to religious. I'm a lapsed budhist. I do everything a good budhist does. Except abstinence. Ear plugs? This is a fantastic things. Did you ever imagine.. 30 years to go back here? No. Remember, how excited we felt when we first got his place? It feels like that again! My gut says: Poshalaskan polo covecod What do you think? - Should never taken out that line. We'll talk fish after we fix this place. We'll talk fish after we fix this place. Katie's got some good thoughts. Says we should keep the old look. And she had some beautiful idea about the uniforms. Then you know the potential yield at the plaza, Papadopoulos Plaza. Fully developed with 1,000 year lease I'd have kept the free home. I'm telling you Spiro... It was good. Not have been worth a fortune. Worth, I don't know... 1,5 billion, 1,6 billion? 1,6 billion. Big numbers, Spiro. Big, big numbers. Poor children when we came to the UK. With nothing. We start again. Fat Laki, the weight you lost is an inspiration. Phil the Till, you have many Greeks with your tax friendly till machines. Ey, only two things are certain in life. Death and taxes. Unless you're Greek! Then it's only death! Nikos, Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula, Uncle Panikos, Aphrodite, Maria And of course fater Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Father Jimmy get done just selling ilegal kabooze "Rambo"? He owns 3 liquor stores in Palmers Green. He must hated me. People, hallo! Sorry, hi. Ah, just wanted you know this is temporary situation for the family. I'm curently negotiation with the top corporate finance team about requiring the assets of Papadopoulos & Sons. That's it. What did he say? - He's had some sort of breakdown. Tragic. - James! Musik! Thank you. I officially anounce the renovation of the "Three Brothers". That's for when we launch sometihng. - To hell with convention. Don't rush me. It's been a long time since I had meat like this. What's he doing? He's assessing the competion. There's a reason why Hassan is still in business. Texture: very good. Way above average. Meat content: hive. Mechanically recovered cheap rubish, you wish. This is a quality donut. Nicely cooked. With all the right combination of herbs. It's beautiful. It doesn't mean we can't take them on. No. I'm not saying we can't. Yes? Sorry I... What do you want? That's a lot of Greeks. What? We're going out. - Not too late. Well, she is eighteen. We'll make a better product to the cheaper price with larger protion. We'll lose money on the kebabs on the sort terms, put the Turks out of the business within the year, make a margin on the first and where the rest of this crummy street packed up. We'll rise our prices and cut our portion size. The entrepeneur has spoken. - Hey! It's temporary, but as long as we're here we do business. You know, when he was a little boy come home from school and sit there, just like that. Who was the third? Brother? - Michael. He died in the fire without parents, your grand parents in Cyprus. In a war between the Greeks and the Turks. But you both escaped? Spiros climb down and Michael who was... six Yeah. Drop me down. I was just a baby. I caught him. But Michael, he... Told me highly to jump, but he... He ran right back in to the house. I never know why. One night everything changes. I thought probably wanted to save his mom and dad. You know what? I never thought about that. You could be right. yeah. You're wise boy, James. Your soul is old. Tell me, this is always been a big question for me for many years. Do you think I could've done something else? For Michael? - No, you were holding a baby. Yeah. - When how old were you? - I was nine. You're only a boy. Like Theo. H? Hallo? What's wrong with him? He! Don't worry, it's temporary. Excuse me. Did I said something wrong? He was only nine. I never thought about how young he was. I bet he has. Tee. James? Come here. Sit down. I've let you and your brother and your sister down. Dad. I've made a promise to your mother, that I'd take care of you. And you're doing that. This is humiliating for you. - Dad, we'll get through this. I... I don't know... King Lear. I don't know the story. - Well then... King Lear loses everything. Absolutely everything. And he find himself in the middle of his store room. With nothing. And... His kids, they... hate him. They even think of him a prick. What happens to him? Well then he dies. But it has to end like that. Because it's a tragedy. I'm sorry about your plants. I can get a new ones. Why you didn't bring more with you? I don't wanna get in the way. You such a sweet boy. Get that from your mother. Your stutter's getting better. You know what? I'm gonna go and get you a plant. Now. From the house. What, right now? - Yeah. I'm gonna go and get you a plant.

That's all I could find. - Thank you. It's prety late. I said they could help. - This is a holiday. Uncle Spiros said I can make beer and vodka batter. It doesn't sound very good. Hey, you need to stay up, it's the holidays. Tomorrow we'll look through news paper and pick up some stocks. How's that grab you? - Natural resources is a good buy. Hey, wait. Show us your fine skills. Yeah, I was telling them how you were born with timer in your head. How you fried to perfection. Everytime. Not tonight. Come on, Dad. Show us how to fillet a fish. - Go on daddy. Yeah, H. Come on. Show us. Show us. Show us. Show us, show us, show us... You should really be thinking about bed all of you. Good night. Bed? Alright, so where we going? City. Get a loan, get the business back, get the house back. This suit alright? Yeah. It's a suit. Oh! Doesn't I don't know... fit. I don't believe it, They're kissing. Ah, kids. Come on. - In the street? They're smoking, they're hanging out. Did they... What? - They're screwing? No. They just kissing. We gotta get out of this place. Come on, he's a sweet guy. Out! Family's in the gutter. You're over reacting Harry. - The thought of her pregnant. In a kebab shop. Harry, don't worry about Katie. She can look after herself. What are you doing? I got something to say. About Katie? Is she pregnant? - No. Oh God. Are you... Have you got cancer? No. No, just... Just bear with me. So... Here it goes. "After years of abuse, on my behalf and unexceptable behaviour. I reached the moment of clarity". Actualy this was two years ago. "I'd like to apologise for the hurt I've caused" What now? "There were aspects of my behaviour which was unexceptable. This includes and is not limited to... " - Why now? I've been carying this... If you don't wanna hear we can do it later. No, now is fine. Now is good. I've just... Skip that. "I have abused your generousity." I agree with that statement. "When we were children and got to London, I look after you. Got you ready for school, made you do your home work. I taught you to cook, ride a bike, speak Greek, dance, Why don't you speak Greek? You were reading a list. "I've fought with Steven Klein, when he accused you of stealing his ortopedic shoe." Remember that? - Yeah. Did you take it? - No. You can tell me now. - I didn't steal the shoe. Are you gonna read all of that? I don't have to. Why did it go wrong with us, Spiro? We might as well get to it. Why did you turn againts me after I left the shop? I never turn againts you. - That's what it felt like. I was jealous of you. You were my brother. Brothers get jealous. You were more than a brother. You were my life. And then you left. Gone. I set up the business. I wasn't gonna stay in the shop. You could've come with me. Harry, you were so fast. You were like a plane, like a super sonic jet. But I gave you everything you wanted, did I ever once turn you down in all the years after I left the business. Did I? And after it went past. But it was never enough. Every week something new. Writing cheque to... I don't know you've got some wierd friends. Who was that bloke with a pin head keep turning up at the house? Not of my friend anymore. And than drunk at Elisabeths funural? And you big teared at his speach. I heard about it. Well that was it. For me, for us. You were right to cut me off. She never had a bad word for you, Elisabeth. She always forgive you, and she make me forgive you. Everytime. Yeah, she did. I always have a way back, when she was with us. Elisabeth was so good to me. She was our world. She was our world. I'm sorry, I can't... It's okay, H. - I gotta get to this meeting. It's an important meeting. It's okay to miss her. Oh Man. Just give me a minute. With the help of Lars and the Norske Velconan Bank we aim to buy Pap & Sons back from the recievent. Also, Harry I have to say that I believe there's an intuitive bonds between the Greek and the Nordic people. As well maybe the first Vikings were decendants from the ancient Greek, some where in the deepest of time. Until it's so... ...so vagnerian. Yeah? We should point out the new approach. To buy Papadopoulos & Sons, but divest the food manufacturing side of the business. Divest the food manufacturing? What else is there? Set off the food, but keep the property. Papadopoulos Plaza. It's gonna be worth a fortune! That's not what I had in mind. - It's an asset break up. Tuska, tuska, makes it sound like Barbarian. With the new loan you buy back your old assets and then sell off the brand and the Pop & Sons table. And you know how to squeeze the value harry. That's a break up. - Please, I know what it is. The pita bread, the cake, they get sold to a bakery. The Halloumi and Feta to a dairy company. I love your Halloumi! Grilled, it's... The sell off value of these brands will exced the new loan. So, my bank will get its money back faster than you can say knife. And what do you get? Lars wants 50% of the Plaza development. Which is what would remain after the debt has been settled. So you get 50% of the development for free? - Sure, yeah. Would you get 50% of the same development, yeah. Also for free. What do you want, Harry? - I want my food busines back. Guys, guys, guys reality check. Harry, it's not gonna happen. Ok, the best you can hope for is to work with Lars here and save something. Can't say no. Okay, so I need to take this to the board. Takes 2-3 months, but pischa. It seems criminal to buy the business back only to break it up. Can I just point out that you are skating, figuratively speaking on thin fucking ice. I'll do what ever the bank wants. - Ok. Harry, we are gonna take this to the hoop. Three points! Taking out a loan to pay off a loan, so you can remortgage a property. It's got nothing to do with business. It's got nothing to do with making stuff. I'd get my life back. No, you get a loan for some land. My children get their lifes back. I'm sorry. This isn't very profesional. Do you give your client a hard time Sophie? No. Just the interesting ones. You've got 5 minutes. - Yeah, of course. I just want to about the shop and.. make sure that my brother got the right plan for a girl. Okay, lets grab a cup of coffee. So, it's 30% of material. The fish, the potatoes, the packaging, etc. Would you include energy? Light, heat? Yeah. But not rent, because we already own the building. Okay. And 30% on labour? - Yeah. So it's 30-30-30 classic restaurant model. That's right. What are your weakneses? Price of fish can vary dramatically. Can you vary the menu? You don't want it complicated. Doesn't have to be complicated, Harry. What are your fears? - My fears? Just that it won't work out. That Fish & Chips maybe had its day. No. Hang on a second.. Fish & Chips, it's a British classic. Much more than just a quick meaningless experience, it's... something to be savored. Just think of the soft white cod flakes gently falling away as your fork pierces the heart crunchy shell of the golden batter. The rich smell of the friers delight, the tangy smack of salt and vinegar on your lips. Hell yeah! I'd pay for that. And we should talk about um... We should talk about a cunning packages. - Yeah. Yeah, we should. This time last year I was in Malibu. We'll go tonight. It's not a night club. It's America. Look, the shop's where I'm from. But.. it's not where I'm gonna end up. My dad, must've said that to my mom once. Maybe even on this bridge. Silly, look where he ended up. So what's your plan? Property. Got an eye for it. I'll probably be a Popstar one day. - Cool. Yo, yo, yo, it's time to die. Yoyo blue buterfly. He was fat, he was bloated. He was fairly attracted to my lapple. That is wild sick! I wrote something for you too. It's a poem. It's called: "Sometimes I want for nothing else." Just you and me, in an ever expanding universe, shagging cup of tea. Sometimes I want for nothing else. Fuck. You're amazing. Start from the side fin on the top here. And cut in one move all along the fish. Lovely come and try. Fresh fish lovely of chips, delicious fish. Come and try. Pickle boy! Battered inside. Special chips for you. And one for you. Off you go. Fish and Chips come and try. We batter our own fish. We make beautiful fresh fish inside. Sir, have a chip. Have a fish. No? None for you. Sir, come and try. Come and try. It's not just Fish and Chips. There's room for all of us. What do you want, Hassan? Remember when we were children? When we were friends? We weren't Greeks, Turks. Respectfuly I would like you to take your kebabs off the menu. This is Fish and Chips shop. What do we get? I want to fish. You don't do fishes. You're going to put us on the street. It's business. - It's not about business! Perhaps you wouldn't be like this, if we were Greeks. I'd tell you what. We'll take kebabs off the menu... if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter. More tea? - No, thank you. This is very difficult. - Come on, it's easy. My son is his own man. - Right, no deal. Is this because he's Turkish? Because he's a muslim? Oh, no. I don't have a problem. Harry's not make bet. Because he works in a kebab shop, is that it? Yeah, Harry's more like that. I'd ask you, both of you. To respect a mans aspiration for his daughter. I have similar aspiration for my son. Spiro? Perhaps you should remind your brother where he is now. Tell him to look around. Perhaps he still sees a big mansion with big garden and servants. Well, I don't. But more importantly, neither did my son. This is only temporary, we'll be gone in a couple of months. I hope so. It's gonna be long couple of months. - For both of us. Say cheese! So here we are. Here we are. I'm sure it'd be good news. If it's good news, Spiro. I want you to have the shop. All of it. Will we get to visit uncle Spiros again? - Of course we will. Who's gonna help run the store? I'm gonna need you little man. I'd expect uncle Spiros will always find you a holiday job. Hallo. Lars, yeah. Just, I'm just... What is it? - Did you get the loan? Bad news i'm afraid. - Realy? - Yeah. We're going home, we got it! We're going home. - Congratulation. What's wrong? We're leaving. We're out of here. We've got the loan. We should be celebrating. - Not here, he's right. It's a good day. You... you... made it! You're a survivor. Sorry. What is it with you Spiro? Why can't you be happy for me? When ever I've any kind of success, you always have to stamp on it. Where are you going? - I am happy for you. I am. What is it? What's wrong? There's this... He looks dead to me. No, he's not dead. He's sleeping. He's still sleeping Like... Sleeping beauty? - Yeah. It's a good way looking at him. Sorry. I hope I'm not... - No, come in. James? James! And take the um... Yeah, I heard the news, and I realy wanted to bake something. So I made a Greek easter cake. Don't ask. - No, that's really... lovely. Thank you very much. We'll have some of that. James. He's in a mild koma apparently, and we have to talk to him and play music and uh.. James, put the... turn the music on. Hey, wake up! The accountant's here, you better wake up. James! - He's a coin! Katie! - Sorry. Don't just stand up, you.. Let me do it. Wait, I felt something. Katie, get the doctor. I don't want them to ask. Oh, for fuck sake. I'll do it. - James! Excuse me... Doctor I felt something just now, a gripping movement. Anything else? No, just a slight squeeze. Is that a sign? It could be, the court can't respon. It's difficult to tell. Right. How long is he gonna be like this? He suffered a heart attack. It's hard to predict. You should all take a break. I'm sorry about him. Yeah, we'll leave him to you. Say good bye to uncle Spiros. Come on, it's ok. Would you mind staying around, Sophie? - Of course. So he saved me twice. Once in the fire, and once after the bank. I was always embarrassed by him you know. By these things that he does. You know his thing. But the things that he does, it's a good thing really. These last few months... This year actualy... This whole year. The whole year. What a year. And yet... I've never felt so alive, I never felt so engaged. Why is that? I mean why? I'm frying chips! I love him. I've always loved him. And I love my children. I love... I love my live, I love it. Why is that? Why do I love it now? What's wrong with before? It's okay. It's a crazy, crazy world. It's up, It's down. You fight, you win, you lose.. Become exhausted, then you leave. It's not logic. It's not logic, it's insane. It's insane. The whole thing. No, no, no Spiros. - I'll get some one. You have to let me go. Michael is with us. Michael. Michael was always there. Always with us. Always. Three Brothers. When I was a little boy. You cooked for me, everytime I came home. They were good time, Spiro. Efcharist (Thank you) kal zo Good life. Now you understand. Did you do this? It was for you and uncle Spiros. And Mum. Thank you, James. It's the ivy you saved that night. We meet again. Did you know about this? They can move back to the house if you want. The plants, they quite easy to move. But they also very happy to... grow here, as well. If we choose to stay. It's what ever you want to do, Daddy. We're really proud of you. Thank you. Theo. Good day at school? - Very good day. Impress the teacher with his ability to solve quadratic equation. That is fantastic. Your friends are outside. Because you won't come to me, I thought I come to you. I'm not changing my mind, Rob. I just want to talk. Tell me this is a joke. I don't want to do the deal. Harry, you have seriously lost the plot on this one. It just doesn't feel right. We worked hard on this. If he doesn't wanna do the deal. He doesn't wanna do it. Shut up! - Hey! No need for that. - I don't understand. I've got everything I want. And I've got no debt. And that feels good. When I lock up my shop at night, it feels good I've got no... debt, no loans. I own it. 100%. Come on. A percentage of something that could be worth millions, you walk away from that? For chips shop? - Yeah. Right now yeah, I would. And I'm with my children. And that's... Can't put a price on that, Rob. And I'm having fun. We're having fun. Come back to the shop, let me get you something to eat. Come, we're doing great business. I'm actualy thinking of expanding. That's a... That's good Harry, that's very good. I'm happy for you. If this is succsess. What is succsessas, Rob? What is it? We both had it, what is it? Is it the share price? Is it the profit earning ratio? Is it beautiful car? You tell me Harry. You had it all. Yeah, I have. And I can tell you. Succsess... is... the joy you feel. That's it. That's all it is. Succsess is the joy you feel. Come on, lets go. I don't think so. Okay, I'm sorry I shouted at you. I don't care about that. I just don't wanna work for you anymore. Good luck people. Best Fish and Chips in London! - Call me when you wanna Go Public! I just quit my job. Yeah, I think you did.
