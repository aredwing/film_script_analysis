You should see what a chest he has It doesn't mean that I'm not happy to see you! Actually, since he's not here, it's quite convenient Let me guess... You came for carnival! - I ran away. - Ran away? - I'm scared, Serafina! - You? Scared? Of what? Of whom? A man who come to the farm and kept chasing after me - Because you're beautiful, silly! - No - I'm sure he wants to kill me. - Are you crazy, girl?

Could you make the sun rise tomorrow? Sure! Even better, since tomorrow is carnival! What do you play to do that? - I make it up. - And you? Could you? I could make up a melody! I'd love to make the sun rise Give him the guitar. Just to ckeck it out This is a very old guitar... - "Orpheus is my master". - Yes, that's true There was an Orpheus before me. And one may come after I'm gone but I'm the one ruling now. Do you understand that? Don't be sad. Don't tell anybody, OK? I will play a new song I just wrote Pretty, isn't it? Morning, such a pretty morning A new song is born Singing of your eyes, your laughter, your hands There will be a day when you come From the strings of my guitar That only your love sought A voice comes And talks about kisses Kisses lost in your lips Sing, my heart, happiness is back In the dawn of this love - What are you doing here? - I have the right to... Zeca, take the guitar! You didn't see me! - Isn't he here? - Who? Was that you playing? Orpheus taught me Where is he? He just left with a woman What? Since you have the guitar, play something He'll hear me That's even better. Play You again? What are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me that Serafina is your cousin? So, we are close. What's your name? Don't you remember? I'm Eurydice Wonderful! I like you already! Of course! Orpheus likes Eurydice, as the story goes Are you Orpheus? - Yes, I am. From head to toe. - But I... I don't like you Yes, you do! Try to remember. This is really an old story Thousands of years ago, Orpheus was sad and melancholic like the bird trapped in this cage One day, from the strings of a guitar, sought by only one love, a voice spoke of lost kisses from the lips of Eurydice And Eurydice's lips were trembling with anxiety... and the perfumed flower of her mouth opened slightly No! You are too young to remember Yes... I remember the words you sang... - because they are the same! - Exactly! But it was the melody I liked best Forgive me, Eurydice Look I need to talk to him No, leave them alone! Orpheus, they're waiting for you at the rehearsal! Yes! Well... I need to go I know I'll sing and dance for you! - Are you coming? - Yes, I am Take good care of her! Let's go! See you later Thanks Why aren't you paying any attention to me? I have no time now - Answer me! - Go back to your place! I'm sorry. He already saw you. He and the sun Look at Serafina. She is the Queen of Night Look how happy she is - And who is she? - Her? That's Mira. She plays the Queen of Day - She is pretty, isn't she? - Yes She is Orpheus' fiance Look, he's going to kiss her - OK, that's enough! - What's so funny? - Nothing! That's enough! - Why didn't you kiss me? Leave me alone. Have you tried on your costumes? Of course! Mira's costume is a beauty, isn't it? It has embroidered sleeves. Let's go see it Come and dance, Eurydice, come Come on! - And who is that? - Ask Orpheus! - I want a costume for her, OK? - OK, all right When it comes to women, nobody is better than you! Leave me alone! She is pretty! Hot girl - Isn't she better than Mira? - Much better! A real beauty! - She has good taste. - Drop it! - So what? So what? - Where is the costume? That's all we have. A woman like this doesn't need costumes - Hold on, let me look next door. - No - That's right, you're with Mira. - Why are you talking about her?

Do you want to stay here? Yes You won't be scared here. They're great He will protect you too. He is a beast! And then... then there is me - Let go! - Orpheus, is that you? Orpheus! I swear I heard people talking. Didn't you? - It was the dog. - Talking? No. So what? Gimme - She is in good hands. - Who? - My cousin. - Your cousin? Didn't she run off? Dummy! Open your mouth and close your eyes More! More! The dog ripped one of the little animals They're not animals, they're signs of the zodiac It's beautiful That's where I was born. It's my house in heaven A baby sheep? I'll rent the one right next to it, so I'll always be near you Should I? Good night Good night I'll sleep outside. It's closer to my house... and yours Good night, Eurydice One... two... three... four... five - They're playing. - I hope they will let us sleep Come! Come on! Got you!

Anybody there? What are you looking for, brother? Missing Persons There is such a section... but I never saw any missing people there. Just paper That's Missing Persons See? Nobody there... but lots of paper, see? The house is full. for nothing Can you read? - Yes. - I can't Feel free to look around, if you wish... but you will not find missing people in papers On the contrary, that's where they get lost Are you suffering, my brother? I lost Eurydice It's as if she were burning inside my heart Keep calling... She will come I am calling You alone... that's not strong enough... and these papers will not give you an answer Do you think paper cares for anybody? Let's go, my brother.

My arms are empty! I want to see you, to hold you close to me No! You will lose me, Orpheus You are not there. You are tricking me! No! I want to see you! Orpheus, you're killing me! Farewell, Orpheus. You'll never see me again No! You lied to me! Why did you do that to me? - You lied to me. - Calm down, Orpheus. Don't leave! Hermes, that's him. It is him! It's me. Hermes also came I've nothing left in life I am poorer than the poorest of the black men Seek mercy, my son. We are all poor and... what's left to be said is the poor people's word- thanks I ask you for mercy, Hermes All I can do is give you mercy Here. I have already done everything that had to be done I think that you'll get true mercy there Thank you, Hermes No, my son. You are going to thank Eurydice Yes Are you going to take her yourself? All right. Come with me If you don't want it, it's always interesting... having another cadaver for the doctors, for science And it is also cheaper for you It is my duty to ask that question, because of them... and, the truth is, when one is here... Carnival is over, there is nothing one can do Would you like to try and identify her? Careful, you'll get a cold dressed like that Death is cheap here, right? Careful! You're shaking The same thing happens to me It doesn't help to be careful. I have a cold all year round Everything is beautiful, Eurydice My heart is a bird whose thirst is quenched by a drop of dew Thank you, Eurydice. Thank you for this new day You are the one who carries me I am in your arms, like a sleeping child The sweet breath of your chest I know you will take me where I must go Thank you, Eurydice. The path you chose is full of flowers The sun is rising to embrace us, my love You are singing, Eurydice The happiness of the poor is the great illusion of carnival We work all year long Mira! No! No! No! Zeca! Hurry! Hurry! - Play and make the sun rise! - I don't know how! - Sure, you know. - I don't know if I can! Make it up! - Come on, play! - I don't know You do know, come on! He plays well, doesn't he? What are you looking at? Shut up! He is making the sun rise! He made the sun rise! Wow! Just like Orpheus! - Now you are Orpheus. - No Yes. Take this little flower Play a song for me, please Come on! Magic because I speak? But all guitars are magical. They sing, and not just those of singers. My owner at least isn't a singer. He's a streetcar conductor in the big city about to marry a very pretty girl. I don't like her but he will fall in love with a country girl. Very different. Happens every day. Since everyone loves him, all his friends will help him - young and old, rich and poor, little and big. There will be lots of little comedies and maybe even a great drama. It's a very simple love story for all times, for all places, with humor fear, horror, and magic. Joy and death, as in all love stories, the sins and virtues which drive men and women: lust and modesty gluttony and sobriety violence and sweetness anger and tenderness, and love, lots of love. There is something else in our story, something unusual, mysterious, inexplicable. But I am only a guitar, I don't have the right to reveal it. I would love to because it's very important. If my voice isn't drowned out by those of the big city, I will say what I know. Listen to me.
