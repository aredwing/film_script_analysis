Gronckles, aim for the roof! Good work! Just a few hot spots left. - Got it! - Where's Gobber? ls he still inside? No. Cant find him. I'm right here. That beast will pay for this. Gobber, what happened? Whats it look like? A dragon set my home on fire. What? You pushed me too tar this time, you ugly bag of bones! Dad, whats he talking about'? Our dragons don't do that anymore. He doesn't mean one of yours. Gobber, for the last time, - there is no such thing as a... - Boneknapper'? A boneknapper.? What-knapper? A disgusting, foul beast, wearing a coat of stolen bones, like a giant, flying skeleton. The dragon manual says that the Boneknapper will stop at nothing to find the perfect bone to build its coat of armor. It's awesome. Come on! It's a myth. It doesn't even exist. I'm telling you, it's real. I've been running from him my whole life. Hes the one who started this fire. Stoick, we found Gobber's underpants hanging by the stove. They must've started the fire. You still think it's the Boneknapper, or just your underpants? I don't think! I know! Somehow he found me again. This dragon is pure evil. Gobber, ifs late and we're too tired for your stories. Now, get some rest. You rest. I'm putting an end to this. Come on, Phil, let's go. I don't need their help, anyway. I can't let him go by himself. All right, Vikings, grab your shields. - Yes! -Yeah! There's no way I'm getting on a boat to go after a fake dragon. Come on! Put your backs into it, you lazy dogs! Stroke! - You're not even trying! Stroke! - How fun is this? Right? We got the team back together, another adventure... This is pretty cool, huh? Yep, nothing cooler than rowing until your hands bleed. Just want you kids to know that it touches my heart, you helping me slay the Boneknapper. True Vikings, you are. - Gobber, are we there yet? - Oh, you'll know we're close when your ears explode from the piercing screams. Legend says this dragons roar is so fierce, it can melt the flesh right off your bones. Not so, Fishlegs. The Boneknapper has no roar at all. That's why he's terrifying. He's a silent killer. Wait. So if we don't hear anything, were dead? I don't hear anything. Good one, Phil! Did I ever tell you about the first time I met the dreaded Boneknapper I was a young lad, about your age, on summer vacation with my family, when I heard the call of nature, Oh! Dad, pull the boat over! Didn't I tell ya to go before we left? I saw an army of Vikings, frozen in battle! Clutched in the fingers of one of the Vikings was a small treasure chest. I had to have it l reached in and pulled out the chest. It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw But the frozen Viking was alive! He started punching me in the face! My tooth! And there it was. I never even heard it coming. The Boneknapper It crashed into the glacier, causing an avalanche of frozen Vikings! The treasure! I reached into the water... ...Only to find the frozen Viking punching me in the face again! Hey, hey, hey, hey! The Boneknapper wanted that treasure, but I wanted it more! What tuck you so long? You expect us to believe that a frozen Viking punched you in the face? Yeah, twice. Hey, it could happen. What do you mean, "It could happen?" It did! But I outsmarted the silent beast. Gobber, I hate to be a stickler for details, but Boneknappers are not silent. Fishlegs, I know what I didn't hear. - But I could feel it... - Guys? - Are there supposed to be.? - ...had a sixth sense for danger. - I can smell anything". - We're gonna hit these... ...taste the oncoming doom... I'm tasting rocks. We're here. Now, we're stuck in the middle of nowhere and no one even knows where we are Except the Boneknapper. Legend says... Hey, you know what legend also says? Stop talking! - OK, just hold on one darn second. - No need to panic, kids. - I've been shipwrecked many times. - Well, that's comforting. You never forget your first shipwreck. I was stranded on an island with only my broom. Ll was a very small island. Its no wonder the Boneknapper found me again. He never forgave me for taking that treasure. There was another island, my only escape.. But I was surrounded by bloodthirsty hammerhead sharks! I only had one chance. So Iran across the shark-infested waters Take that! Watch it! Night-night, fatty! Someone forgot to brush. I didn't? think I was gonna make ii. But then, from the depths of the ocean, leapt forth a giant hammerhead whale! And the hammerhead whale ate the Boneknapper? Almost, but he got away. Years later, the dragon hunted me down again and chased me into the jungle. All I had was my trusty egg beaten I carved through that thick brush as fast as a jungle cat. Still, the Boneknapper was right behind! Azaleas! Iran up the side of a volcano and courageously leapt across the fiery crater. Then, deep within the burning volcano, burst forth a giant hammerhead yak! OK, wait a minute. Now youre saying a giant hammerhead yak leapt out of a fiery volcano and ate the Boneknapper? You would've thought so, wouldn't you? But the dragon got away again! I knew that boney scoundrel would keep coming after me. So I set up a gauntlet of traps and waited for the beast. And when he was ready... ...he charged! And then I ran like the wind! Bur the traps failed! Then, captured I did what any brave Viking would do... - Help! - The gods must have heard my prayer. It was Thor! He tossed a mighty thunderbolt. - You missed! - Wait for it... Then, from the center of the earth, blasted forth... ...the hammerhead yak riding the hammerhead whale! Deploy the yak. Yes! Oh, my back! Whoa! The whale saluted you? Can you believe it'? But the Boneknapper got away again. - He found me on... - Are you kidding? - I don't believe any of this. - You totally made everything up! - It's time to get out of here. - We need to get home. You don't even have any proof that that thing exists. Of course I have proof. l still have the treasure. This stunning belt buckle. It was in the Viking's treasure chest. It's kept my pants up for years. - It is stunning. - Listen, Gobber? Instead of chasing down an imaginary dragon, maybe we should figure out how to get home. Say no more! I hear you loud and clear. I've got a plan. All right. Whod like to be dragon bait? Gobber, are you sure this is safe? Safety's overrated. OK, herds the plan. The Boneknapper wants me, right? He comes down that trail, sees Fishlegs, thinks it's me, rushes Fishlegs, causing Phil to trip that rope, dropping that ribcage and then we rush in and finish him off, once and for all! It's sad when they get old. Gobber, you're taking this way too far, OK'? You need to face it. There is no such thing as the Boneknapper. Wormsquat! Now, get into position. Way to go, Fishlegs! You're doing fine! No wonder the entire village thinks you're crazy. Hello'? He sees dead Vikings. - Yeah, especially that thing about. - Guys? - This is a waste of time. - Guys! Turn around! Guys, guys! What? It's right behind us, isn't it? Well, what do you know? No roar. Run! OK, Gobber, we believe you! Phil! Find a happy place, find a happy place. No, no, please! Please! He wants my head! I swear he wants my head! Bring it on! You wait till I get out there... Wait. It searches for the perfect bone to build its coat of armor. The treasure! Gobber, take off your pants. - No! - Wait, listen to me. I think Fishlegs was right. The Boneknapper is supposed to have a roar. But maybe he cant because the bone he needs is your belt buckle. Gobber, please, you have to give it back. No way. It's mine! Give him back his bone! No! - Give him back his bone! No! No... All right. Gobber! All right, you've got me. Make it fast. That's gonna give me nightmares. Well, at least we have a ride home. Aren't you cute? Yes, you are! Yes, you are. All right! You know, I never doubted him. I was always like, "He's right" This tailbone is hurting my tailbone. He sure seems happy to have that bone back. Well, legend says the Boneknapper's roar is its mating call. Oh, thats just a myth I think Stoick will believe me now, eh?
