There is this bookseller I sometimes visit. What bookseller bro? He buys and sells second hand books. So... So I work with him. Do you make some money? Why is Hadji Mfit get mad at you? I do not give a fuck. He was the same when we were at the course. Don't you remember? - You aren't married, are you? - No. - Hi. - Hi. What if it gets broken again? Here you go. Why are they handing the shop ever? Maybe the owner went bankrupt. All these books will be under priced. Yakup, this is thorn. - Come on have some simit? - Thanks. I had breakfast. Will you excuse me, may I go? We expect you to dinner, don't make plans. Ok, hopefully. Can you show some stuff to your bookseller. Okay. I will make some tea. There is a good looking chick in your apartment. What chick? I saw her when I was waiting for you. She's a blonde. - She's my neighbor. - Nice. - She's a Christian. - Really? - Nun. - No shit man! Her clothes were regular. Well, I wouldn't know. I just saw her at the church. What were you doing at the church? Is this the book? You are a complicated man. Well, honestly she is beautiful. Anyway you can make her convert to Islam. You would acquire merit at God's sight. Let him take a look at those. Okay. I will show them to brother Yakup. I couldn't have finished even one book. So finish it. - What about this Yakup? - What about him? - Is he trustable? - Yes of course he is. Everywhere is full of swindlers. That's why I asked. We are coming. The prayer is just over. He is with me, we are coming. Women! As if we run away. So, have are you getting along with the community at the mosque? Very good. Thankfully, there has not been any problem. - They also liked you very much. - I am glad. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Make yourself comfortable. - I am, thanks. - Are you engaged? - I am not. I guess it will be my duty to help you get married. As fortune wills. - Any candidate? - How do you mean? I mean candidate. No. You say no in a way as if there is a candidate. No, really there isn't. Come on know. I got it! Who is she? What is she like? Come on tell me. It is a fortunate affair Musa, you shouldn't be ashamed. Is she religious? Yes. Masallah. You won't get hurt by a believer. - As fortune wills. - As fortune wills. Good morning. Wellcome Musa. How is it going? Thank you. I wanted to drop by after the prayer. Good... I have some things to show you. Will you have a look at them? Put them on the table. I'm coming. Are they worth anything? Where did you get these? I have a relative, he gave them to me. Take them back immediately. What is it? Do as I tell you. Alright, but I didn't get why? These pieces belong to the museum. Don't ever bring these kinds of things to me without asking. Alright, I'll give them back tomorrow. Give them back today. Alright I will give them after the noon prayer. Salamun aleykum. This is Musa. I am fine. Look, I showed the papers you gave me to brother Yakup. He is not interested. Yes, since he said that I couldn't insist. When shall I give these back to you? Could it any be sooner? Alright. I'll see you then. - How much? - 2.25 - Hi. - Hi. Are yo headed home? Yes. No, I have things to do. I will come later. - Have a good day. - Have a good day. Police. Hands up! Keep silent! - Are you Musa? - Yes. Handcuffs! Wear these. Why didn't you sell the mosque too? Swindler! Brother! Shut up! Yakup. I swear I didn't know anything. God is my witness, I swear I am innocent, I swear. Okay, okay I know. You told me to take them back. So I called Ayhan, I told him to come and take them. He was also stealing cars. They found one of those pages in its truck. I swear this is the first time I am hearing these. I haven't been seeing him for years. We are going to my place. No, I would better go to my own place. No, I can't accept that. I will make you some soup, it will be good for you. You don't look well. Each day of old age is like this. We are going to my place brother, I don't accept any objection. Musa, let me go to my place. Besides I can't make myself comfortable anywhere else. I will be offended if you keep saying anywhere brother. I spoke to lmam Ibrahim... ...I will be at home anyway. Okay then, so be it. I couldn't even call you. I didn't know what to do. I was too afraid and baffled. Allah allah! What kind of a man he was? I was curious. I asked you to the neighbors, they told me. Who told you? That non-Muslim woman living in your next door. She said police was there. God protected me. Well, it is over now. Yakup, meal is ready. Yakup? Quick quick, something happened to brother Yakup. Water! A glass of water. There is nothing to worry about for the time being. Good. Thank God. We opened the blocked vessel with a stent. But in order to prevent future complications... ...he should take his medicines and stay under cardiologic inspection. - So we will be here for a while. - Yes for another day. The sand bags should stay two more hours. Okay. Thank you very much. I shall go. I hope he'll get better soon. Thank you. Thank you. What can I say, thank you. - Clara. - Clara. Musa. Clara. I brought it here when I went to get your clothes. - Are you alright? - I am fine. I am going to prayer, do you need anything? Thank you. I will come back quickly. Hi. She is paralyzed but at least she is alive. What was she doing for a living? - Nun. - You said, my mother. She is not my real mother but she is like a mother to me. - Welcome. - Thank you. You are welcome too Musa. Clara made some soup for me. - Lf you could excuse me. - But you've just came. - I would better go. - At least have some coffee. - Alright. - I'll make the coffee. Thanks to Yakup, I learned how to make coffee too. If only I could drink it... That night, I don't know what would I do if you weren't here. - Thank you for the coffee. - You're welcome. I was so surprised to see her here. I thought I was at the wrong house. Yakup, if you love your God don't! I'm not saying anything Musa. When did she come? The place was quite a mess. Right before you came. I couldn't make it to? Ile. I still have an unfinished business there. Don't worry about that business. We'll take care of it. I guess I missed that opportunity. It was a good job though. - Salaamun aleykum. - Aleykum salaam. Musa, I will go to my own place, I have a lot to do. No, I won't let you go before you are fully recovered. I should also go to Sile. Mr. Sha's books are at home. I can take whatever you need, don't worry. Clara is my daughter. We were together with her mother in Italy. Anita followed me back here. I found about that much later. Clara was born in a church in Istanbul. Her mother died after she gave birth. I have been looking for my daughter for a long time. Where were you back then? In the prison. Political. She is dead. You will be staying at Bianca's. They should call you soon. If you will have an emergent need call me. - I should get going. - Alright. Wait wait! There are some clothes there, have a look at them. Ok. - Musa. - Yes. - Shall we invite Clara to breakfast? - Ok. - Is she coming? - She is not at home. Her lights were off last night too. Clara is still not around. - May it be easy brother. - Welcome. I am making some coffee. Why don't you play some music? I don't have a player. Then you take care of the coffee, I will go shuffle the radio. Coffee is ready. It is really bitter. Drink, you'll get used to it. Yakup, are you going to tell Clara? I am scared. What if I tell her? - No. - Why? I'm waiting for the right time. - What shall I fix for the dinner? - I invited Clara this evening. Really? - Here you go sir. - Thank you. Who wants cola? - I'll have some. - I'll have some too. Here you go. Thank you. Do want some more. What time we are leaving tomorrow morning? We'll see. I say we should go early in the morning. Ok. It will be my first time in Sile. - You have never been there? - No. Me neither. I believe you'll tell Clara today. - No, I can't. - Why? I am scared. I will tell her then. No. Why? I'm waiting for the right time. Do you want some tea? I will pick you up from here in two hours. Welcome. Do you want your picture taken? No, thanks. Only one picture, as a souvenir. Ok, then. Can you move there? Can you get closer? A little more closer. Closer brother! - Alright come on now, take it. - Ok. One, two... You are half of the frame. Let me take another one? It's okay. No problem. Let me take another one. Alright, it is okay, thank you. The color of the sea will be different in fall. We will come back in fall then. I can't. Why? I will not be here. Why? I will go to Italy, to become a nun. Good night. - I will not be coming Musa. - Why? That's the way... Good bye. Clara...
