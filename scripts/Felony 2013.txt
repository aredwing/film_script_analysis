Okay, so... - And he's hit his head and he's not moving. Okay, alright. Do you think that maybe he could have been hit by a car? - Uh... no. I don't know. Okay. Alright. - I mean... there's a possibility, but he may have just fallen off his bike. I don't know. Okay, but he's lying on the road with the bike, and you can't see anything else around? - Um, hold on a sec. Hold on. - Okay. - Yep. Someone's just arrived. Um... Someone's just arrived? Like a vehicle? - Yeah, like a truck. Hold on. Hey, mate, can you... Can you make sure that no-one drives past here or make sure they're in that Lane. - Hurry up! I'm a cop, alright. - Keep the lights flashing. - Is he alright? - Yeah, yeah. Um, hold... what? Yeah. Sorry, I'm trying to do two things at once. What? That's okay. How about you put the phone on speakerphone? - Yeah. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Now, is there anything around that you can keep him warm with? Like, a jacket, a blanket? - Oh, yeah, well, I can get something from my car. Okay, that'd be great. Is there someone - yeah, there's a guy here. Hold on. I'll go now. Mate, could you sit with him for a minute? - I don't know anything about first aid. - Just make sure he doesn't move. Like, maybe cradle his head. I'm just getting something from my car. Yell out if anything happens. Here it is. Just here. He still hasn't moved, but he's still breathing. I'll just move you out of the way for a sec. - Sorry. - Ya. What's happened to him? I think he's just had a head injury, I... I guess. Were you actually involved in the incident? - Alright, just ask them why a model citizen on the dole would want to buy three mobile phones. Just ask them that, alright? It's a good question. - Yeah, well, there is method in all this. Yeah, but just... just tell me that the intercepts hold. That's all I want to know. - City west 102, we're a detective unit in the area... - Hold on. What are you doing? What is this? Copy that, 102. Your eta in progress? - Yeah, city west 102. Eta, three to five minutes. - That's not us. Carl, I'm gonna go now. - That's traffic. Woman on radio: Gentleman in the white shirt found him. Thanks, ultimo 1. If you could attend outside the east ocean restaurant. Sussex street at haymarket... Detective constable Jim melic. This is detective sergeant Carl summer. - Sir. - What's going on? - We've got a kid in critical condition, no perpetrator, one possible witness. We've got a bystander who's ID'd the kid. He lives about five blocks away. We're trying to get in touch with the family. - Who's the witness? There's no witness. The guy found the kid. Wha... He's a detective? That's the guy, yeah. - Yeah, well, wait on a minute. I don't understand. Is this his scene or what? Um... look, I was told that he's the witness, he's the one that found the kid. - Just get your guy back here. - Constable? Yep? - Sir, I just, um... I just wanted to say I, um... I trained with Liam. He was a great, great guy. I'm really sorry about what happened. - He's... He's a detective. Off duty. He was just driving. - So, what, he's a witness? A suspect? What, first on the scene? - I've literally just barely started speaking to him. Hey, Carl. - Hi, mal. This is Jim. Jim melic. How are you? - Yeah, yeah. We were introduced. - That's right. - Yeah, he's over from mosman. - That's right. - Yeah. - So, what, what is it? Fallen, you think? Or maybe a fail to stop, you reckon? Uh, well... It could be a fail to stop. What, you didn't see anything, or...? - Jim, go and help those boys out with the perimeter, will you? Make it your scene. - Uh... - I'll handle stuff here. Just open a wider perimeter. Bloody rubberneckers. Righto. Copy that. - Come on, folks. You know the drill. Don't set up there. This is a stupid spot to park. - So, I, uh... heard you took a shot yesterday. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, a very lucky one. - Up too bloody early anyway, aren't you? - Don't worry, we'll have you out of here in a minute, so just, uh... You know what? - Actually, you guys can piss off. Get down there beyond the truck, alright? Take a hike. Let's go. Come on. Hey, I want tape up here, across the road in front of the van. No-one gets through, alright. Who's on traffic? Fucking hell. - Constable, come here. - Yes, sir. So, constable, detective toohey's obviously a colleague of mine, and with all due respect, detective, I believe you. I know you to be an upright citizen, for the most part, anyway. So I'd like you to be present for the witness statement if you would, for posterity, whatever that means. Yes, sir. - It's your call, constable. You stay and do this. I'll oversee the forensics, alright? - Yes, sir. Quite a character. - Yeah, yeah. - So run me through what you saw. - Uh, so I was driving up around the bend, I was traveling north on my way home, and... oh, well I saw the... I saw the kid, but I thought he was a shape or I don't know what on the road. And I was just sort of stopped here, and then there's, in the middle Lane, a car stopped, just sort of idling with, like, brake lights on. But when I stopped, he... he just took off. That's when I came back and then I made the call to emergency. That was about 15 minutes ago. Ready in one, two, three. - Has there been any word on the kid? - Well, they won't know until they get him to the hospital. Excuse me, officer? What is going on? - There's been an accident just across the road. Do you know his name? He's in the ambulance? - Yes, ma'am. - Can you get one of these guys to take me to a hospital? - Please wait. No, I need to go to the hospital. I need... no, I need to go now. I need to go now. No. Please, take me to the hospital. No, I need to go now. I need to go now. - I think we're just about done here, mate. - Uh-huh. Yeah, look, I just can't actually hear. I've got the bloody vacuum cleaner behind me. What was that? Oh, okay. Yep, no worries. Alright. Cheers, mate. Thank you. - You want to sign this? It's the statement for the possible fail to stop. Yeah, it's right down there at the bottom. - Mm-hm. Hey, I'm looking at this file and I'm just curious what got you so into this Victor bloke. I mean, you've got virtually nothing on him, aside from... Well, he's on the offenders register... - He did it. Well, yeah, but... - Well, watch the tape. - That's a disc. - The disc. Watch it. I've watched the disc. - Watch it again. - Got it. - I've got a date with my mother. Now, the file for the telephone intercept should be up. Listen to every word. If the footnote says, 'nothing of interest, ' take it with a large pinch of sodium chloride. Find something. If you look hard enough, you always will. That's the way you're gonna impress me, not by bringing me cups of coffee. - The intercepts hold. - Right. We're stirring the pot good now. - Yeah. Uh, yeah. Cheers. Together... Bitch again, dog... - Sorry. Hey! - Hey, nice of you to join us! - Sorry I'm late. - Hi! - That was awesome, mum. - Thank you, darling. - Honestly, I'm stuffed. Young William is in a critical condition, and it may never be known what caused his injuries. Police are appealing to anyone... - Babe? We're cutting the cake soon. You know, if you're not gonna tell me things, then can you tell your friends not to either? You were shot at. Red cordial is like crack. Oh-hh! - Dad. - Hey, mal. How are you? - How are you going, Brendan? - Good, mate. - Sleepy. - Jemma, how are you? - I'm good. How are you doing? - Yeah, good. Real good. Need a beer? - Oh, God. How'd you pull up? - How do I look like I pulled up? - Hideous. - Yeah, thanks. It's how I feel. - So, mal, are they sidelining you? - Uh, I don't know. - Does your wife actually know you're a cop? - I'm sorry. - It's fine. - Hi, um... - What is...? - I'm a detective. I was called to the accident this morning. I just dropped by to see how you're doing, but I should probably take off. - Come in. - Please. - Okay. - This is my boy, William. My cheeky boy. If you could see him, he's so cheeky. I almost expect him to jump off the bed and say he's been playing a trick on me. - I'm Jim, by the way. - My name's ankhila. - Yeah. Well, I just... I just dropped by to see if there's anything we can do, I can do, anything you need. - Thank you. Very kind. There's only one thing that I need. Would you get that, Carl? - Jim. G'day, sir. Could I have a word? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come in. Did you get anywhere? - Uh, no. Not yet, no. Still got a little more to get through, though, so... - Oh, right. Come into the den. Want to take a pew? - No, that's alright, mate. I won't hang around. - So what's up? - Um, well, something's kind of been playing on my mind and I just wondered if I could run it past you. - Yeah, well, you won't grow hair on your palms, no matter what anybody tells you. - Um, this morning, the hit-and-run, one of our detectives was at the scene. Detective toohey, was it? - Mal. - Mal. Yeah. Well... I... It's usually in a case like that, normally, wouldn't we run a full forensic on the vehicle? Take the vehicle in... Well, yeah, yeah. Well, that's exactly what we did. Well, yeah, but a thorough forensic. - Forensics had a good look at the commodore. I made sure of it. - They had a quick look at it. - Jim, has this just occurred to you or was this on your mind earlier? - Yeah, it was kind of on my mind earlier, yeah. - Well, why didn't you bring it up? - You're my superior. I didn't want to... - You thought we skipped a beat? No, not at all. No. I just... I don't know, you know. I just wasn't sure, that's the thing, why the full forensic wasn't done on his car. - He's one of us, and he's made a statement. - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. When I sent you away at the scene, I did it for a reason. I did it so, you know, I could ask mal if he had, you know, anything to say. You know, to give him the respect of not being treated like a criminal in public if he had anything to hide. - So you just asked him? Too right. And there is no doubt that he was clear and direct with me. - Of course, yeah. Because... - No, no, sorry, Carl. Sorry. I didn't mean to come in here and be a pest. I'll... I'll get out of your hair, mate. Sorry. - No, no, no. Come this way. It's a shortcut. No, you didn't do anything wrong, Jim. I had the same feeling myself at the scene. No, the only thing you did wrong was taking such a long time before bringing it to me. But, you know, it takes a while working with new people to start seeing with the same eyes. - Yes, sir. - Yes. Alright. See you later. - Okay. - A spotty dog, is it? - "They came to a yard full of dinghies and yachts, "and round they went." - Oh, why did you do that? - "Except bottomley potts..." - Didn't you know, the last one, I saw hairy... - He stuck? He stuck? - Yeah, he's stuck. - He can't move. They asleep? - Yeah, finally. - You fancy a quickie? - Hmm? - Hmm? We only have, you know, today and tomorrow and then we miss the boat for another month. Let's go. - Okay. ...It's one, two, goal! What a wonderful strike by... - Hey. - Hey. - I just spoke to jemma. Little boy's in a coma. I'd say it's induced because of the head injuries, which is not as bad as it sounds. His name's William sarduka. The details are all there. The mother's there most of the time, so... Come on, guys. Let's go. Ready? - Bye, daddy. - Yeah, say bye. Say bye, babe. "Love you, daddy." - Bye, dad. - Bye. See you. I can open it. - Detective toohey, Nick jemanus, the day report. We're doing a story on the recent spate of hit-and-runs in the area where Asian and African... I'm not authorized to talk. Could we have a word with you? - You have media liaison, mate. You know the story. - What's it feel like to be a hero? You were in pursuit of a suspect. Shots fired? - Two shots. Am I gonna have to take time out over all this stuff? - Not necessarily. I mean, you didn't discharge your weapon. - Mmm. - But in 2006... - Mmm. - ...discharged your weapon. - By accident. - By accident. - Where? - In the elevator. I was dicking around and... It was dumb. So... It was 2006. - You look tired. - I'm tired. - You sleeping? - Yeah. It's just been a big couple of days. I took a sleeping pill, so I'm a little bit foggy today. Um, it was a 'razepam. - Do you normally take such strong medication? - No. My wife is a nurse, so it's just... you know, it's around the house, so I took one. - Okay. That's fine. - There you are. You about done? He all better now? Brain fixed? Tick? - We were just getting started. - Well, I'm sorry, but I need to borrow him. - Mm-hm. Sorry. - Okay. I'll catch you later. One of your round-ups from the weekend is keen for a plea deal. Uh-huh. Which one? Doolan. Turns out he's an ex-cop. Brisbane. Uniform. - Really? - Yep. I heard about this business with this Indian kid. Oh, yeah. - So it's, uh, all good? - Uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, it was definitely odd, but it's fine. - Good. - Come. Ah, there he is. - What does he want? - He's gonna give us three names. - Three names for what? - Possession. - Possession? - Possession with intent to sell, and my client's agreed to cooperate. He was manufacturing. He was cooking up, so, you know... We want the communications. - Three names. Final offer. - Mmm. Mm-mm-mm. I imagine this whole business is a bit embarrassing, isn't it? For a decorated officer. It says you were injured in 2002, discharged, and I bet they gave you a pretty crap payout too, hm? So, you know, I get it, man. Look, let's forget it. I get it. I totally get it. You got two kids, and you don't want this getting out in the press, do you? But it... it could. So, look, this is what I think you should do. What you should do is you tell us how they're communicating, give us your names, yeah, but how they're communicating. We'll give you a letter of assistance for the magistrate, which is great, and we'll keep you out of the press, get you immunity. Or you don't cooperate with us and you end up in the daily telegraph tomorrow morning, which is not good. You know, we'll leak that stuff, we'll give 'em a photo 'cause, you know, we need a bit of good press around here. So we have three new players and we know how they're communicating, finally. We have an email address they all have access to through a shared password. - You'll love 'em. There's new ones from last night. Our lovely friend alcohol. Drunk-dial. Sarah to Tina. "Stupid bitch." "Grow the fuck up." "Stupid slut." "Whore." Now, she doesn't give anything specific away here, but here... Oh, yeah. This is Tina to Victor, and I quote, "why am I fucking, you know, protecting you two anyway?" Are on the right, second floor. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Jemma. - Hey. - What room is he in? Is it 43? - 43. - I'll catch up with you. And Jake made William a card. Didn't you, Jake? This is William's mum. Thank you. And this is Malcolm. - Hi. Hi. These are for you. - Thank you. - We wanted to wait a day or two. We didn't want to intrude. - You were with him? You helped him? - Uh... uh, yeah. - They said without you, he wouldn't... Thank you. I don't know how to thank you properly. - That's... - No, there is no words to thank you. - I really, I didn't... Look, it's... it's really... Thank you. Thank you. Hey, we should probably... We should let you get back to it. And we've got to feed these little... - We just wanted to make sure you're okay. - ...these rascals. - Thank you. - So, yeah, we didn't want to intrude for very long. We just wanted to... - You have our number. If you need anything, please call us. - Thank you. - Thank you. Bye. - Bye. - Thank you. Race you there. Whoever presses the button wins. - Let me press the button! - Don't run, guys. Triple 0. What service do you require? Ambulance. Emergency. Ambulance emergency. What suburb? Kings park. Okay. Kings park. And what's the exact address there? I'm on epson road and the nearest cross street is, uh... Uh... We can... Ah, it's quarry... quarry road. Okay. Alright. So tell me exactly what's happened. There's a boy and he's on the road and he's had a... He's fallen off his bike. And he's hit his head and he's not moving. - What am I supposed to... - hang on, wait. Just listen. He's unconscious and breathing, but he's not moving. Okay. Do you think that maybe he could have been hit by a car? Uh... No. I don't know. I mean... There's a possibility... - There's a possibility. - Yeah. - Listen. ...He's not moving. Okay, alright. Do you think that maybe he could have been hit by a car? Uh... No. I don't know. I mean... There's a possibility, but he may have just fallen off his bike. I don't know. Okay, but he's lying on the road... - I think we need to investigate detective toohey further. - Oh, Jim, this is the stupid... - I wanted to defer to you, but, you know, I think if it's not too late, we should run a full forensic on his car, you know, a structural check, you know. Detective toohey should be questioned, perhaps even given a chance to change his statement. Or... rather, to make a formal statement. - Look, I just don't know what you're hearing. - The pause, the time it takes him. I mean, he's lying. The hesitation in his voice... - Okay, okay, just hold up, just relax, alright. He's a cop. - Yeah. - Yeah, so he shouldn't be panicked and hesitating. He's used to these situations. - He's got a little kid there in serious need. - But you don't think it takes him too long to give a clear answer? Oh, no. I just think you're reading stuff into what seems to me a pretty normal situation. Alarm bells aren't ringing for me. - He's lying. - I think you want him to be lying. - Okay. Then explain this next thing. - So the operator keeps him on the line, yeah, and he doesn't mention anyone else, anything suspicious, no other cars, yeah? So why in his statement 15 minutes later does he detail seeing another car when he came across the kid? Tail-lights taking off around the corner. I mean, you can say he's under stress, but... - Okay, mate, you relax. This isn't proof of anything, alright? I'll talk to him, okay? And then I'll decide what's the best course of action. Okay? - Yeah. - For the record, I think you're drawing a seriously long bow. - With all due respect, I... I really feel strongly about this, Carl. You know, and... I think it's possible that, you know, your personal relationship with detective toohey could be clouding the issue a little. - You really just said that? Hey, no offence intended. - I'll decide whether there's any offence taken. Uh, Carl? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I've got a minute. What's going on? Where are you right now? - Go and help those boys out with the perimeter, will you? Make it your scene. I'll handle things here. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. I want a wider perimeter. Bloody rubberneckers. - Yeah, copy that. Folks, show some respect. - So, I, uh... heard you took a shot yesterday. - Oh, yeah. - A very lucky one. Yeah, I was gonna try and make the party, but Manny keeps me tied to the house. That's why it's not the best environment in the world to be the only one on soda water. So, you're feeling a bit under the weather, I bet. Yeah well, we'll have you out of here in a few minutes, so just run me through what happened. You found the kid? - Mmm. Yeah, I don't know exactly what happened, 'cause... Look, I think that, um... You think what? Don't fucking bullshit me. Have you made a statement? Nothing? Did, uh... Did anyone see you? How much have you had to drink? - I had a bit, I had a bit. - Oh, fuck. Uh, are there any marks on the car? - I didn't hear any noise, so I think I hit his body. I hit him with the side mirror. Alright. Here's what happened. Here's what happened. You rounded the corner, you saw what you saw, a shape at the side of the road. A kid, but you didn't know that then. At the t intersection, you saw a vehicle, the engine idling, brake lights. You don't know what kind of vehicle. Then it took off really quickly, then you pulled over to help the kid. Alright? Alright? Okay. Constable, the breathalyzer? Thank you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Right. Now your turn. Count to ten. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - Okay. I'm gonna take care of the forensics, alright. You play your part. If the wheels fall off, you're on your own. You hear me? Now, you didn't mean to do anything bad. Alright? Just fucking relax. I'll get you through this. Constable, can you come here? - Yes, sir. - So, no point no no, not that good of a party. - Ready. One, two, three. Bars up? - Good to go. - Yep. - That's it. - Take it easy, mal. It's gonna be fine. Thanks. You've got to calm down, okay? You're being paranoid. What business you had going around there in the first place is the question. - What's he going around there for? He's going around there. - He's a crusader. Jesus, the pair of you! What were you thinking? "If I don't run down there soon with a box of chocolates, "she's gonna be offended?" - I've gotta tell the truth. I've got to come clean. - Why? Because you felt a little rabbit in the headlights? Because you think the woman suspects something and suddenly you feel worse? Because Jim... - no. Before all that. Because it is the right thing to do. - Oh, really? It's not because all of a sudden you think the whole thing's gonna come apart? - No, ever since this shit just jumped out of my fucking mouth. - Don't distance yourself. You did that. You did that yourself. - I don't know why I did it. - Survival's why you did it. And now you've got to own it. Now, stop with this bullshit. - Bullshit. It's bullshit. Now, listen to me for a second. We've got to keep this tight, mal, and be smart, and make sure whatever happens, nothing comes out, 'cause if it does, it's gonna be worse 'cause we're all in it, the whole force, mate. I stuck my neck out from the get-go. Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, you told the first lie. I picked up on it. So, limited forensic, no in-depth, the breath test. You add it up. - Carl, I didn't ask for any of that. - Of course you did, with your "help me" face. Your "I've pissed my pants, help me" face. 'Course you fucking did. - I changed my mind. - Oh, bullshit, you have. Bullshit! Fuck off! No way! Oh, what? You bring me in and then 180? Bullshit, you will. The bigger picture, mal. The bigger picture. Think of your family, the investigation. Your reputation. Six months' hard work. 12, 13 arrests. You want to discredit all of us and unpick that too? Well, I'm not gonna let you. Grow a fucking brain. I don't know why we're getting all worked up about this. I really don't. You know, so... Don't wave yourself off the pitch for a mistake because suddenly it's eating away at you. Well, of course it is. You did some damage. You remember that woman that ploughed into Liam? You know, 50s, three kids. Absolutely distraught at what... what she'd done. Well, I saw her sat in court. You know, a million terrible things going on, you know, worse than yours, and it was killing me, but, you know, what can you do? Time. Time and the world swallows events. And it's sad, but that's how it is. And you and me, you know, the world is gonna swallow us up, and who knows in the end if we leave a mark? But... But we're doing something. And I like to think we're doing something good with what we're given. Don't wave yourself off over this. What do you want? Five years in the Nick for... For nothing? That's stupid. Prison is for pricks that don't have their punishment here. Not you. Not me. It doesn't make sense. Alright? - Ah, slim, caught with your hand in the cookie jar. We're on. Newcastle's nabbing Victor and Sarah's being brought in. Let's go. Got him leaving baggage now. He's one fuckin' fat 17 year-old, man. Anyone order a serving of won-ton kid? "One fat fuck to go, pwease." - Wanna shut up unless you've got something worth saying? Uh, yeah, copy that. Sorry, slim. Yeah, you should have him now. - Is that him? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - Shall we go? - Excuse me, buddy. - Hey, nguyen? - Phuk nguyen, yeah? - Yeah. What is this about? - Oh, I just want to have a little word with you. Hey, fellas. It's alright. Hang back. - Yeah, mate, I'll look after that. - Oh, is that the, uh... Is that the new one? - Uh, yeah. - Let's have a seat. Let's have a chat. - Alright, mate. - Just relax. It's okay. Maybe that's a bit uncomfortable. - Yeah, take that off, mate. - Yeah, take it off. You're fucked, both of you. You hear me, pig fuck? Fuck you both! I'll make sure you're fucking dead by the end of fucking tonight. How about that? Fucking faggots! Keep the threats coming, pal. Yeah? How about this for a fucking threat, huh? - How about that for a fucking threat, huh? - Damaging police property. - Stop it, slim. I'm fucking 17. What the fuck are you guys gonna fucking do to me? Huh? Huh? How about that, huh? Hey, settle down. - Fuck you! - Settle down! What are you gonna do to me? Come on, pig! Come on! What do you want? Fucking faggot pig! Come get me, fucking pig! Shut up! - Come get me, pig! - Come on, pig! Yeah! You're fucked, pig! Come get me, pig! - Shut up! - Pig! Fuck you! - Shut up! Mal! Say something! Say something! I put a copy of that report on your desk. Don't worry. It's all good. - I'm, um... ..In trouble, love. I didn't find that kid on the road. I hit him... ..With my car. I didn't mean to lie about it. I just did. I just said it. It just came out of my mouth. First to emergency and then to ambos. I meant to take it back, but I didn't. 'Cause I was scared. So... I'm gonna have to say something. I've got to tell the truth. - He has brain damage. There's every chance that he'll die. Jemma told me at the hospital. I didn't think to say anything because... Jesus Christ. - Um, Carl... knows. And he wants me to keep my mouth shut. - I want you to listen to him. To Carl. To not say anything. Don't say anything. We can live with this. However, at this stage, that either the prints or the dog in fact belong to you. In the circumstances, I'm left with no choice but to grant bail. The bail will be granted on the following conditions. You will reside at 65-117 crayview Crescent, rossdale park. You will report to the officer in charge... ..Between the hours of 8am and 7pm. You will surrender your passport and you are not to approach any children or be in the vicinity of playgrounds or schools. Carl, will you settle down? - It's lazy. - Carl... - It's bullshit and it's lazy. Listen, Carl, you don't pull your head in... - Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. He reoffends, I shall hold this fucking court personally responsible. How's that for contempt? Get a couple of glasses. Sometimes I fucking wonder why I'm here. Ah. Well, we should get a good lift off this. What'll I find? Overdue library book? - Um... Aren't you sort of... Not supposed to... - You've got to learn to finish your sentences, mate. Not supposed to what? - Nothing. - Yeah, well, the courts go back on shit. Why shouldn't I? Bail. For a guy with the history that he has. Then he walks out, just like that. To the biggest criminal of all, the court system. - Shit. Sorry, I've got to... Ankhila? Hi. Is everything alright? Uh... Sure. Yeah, no worries. Yeah, no worries. Take care. Yep. Bye. Um, I've got to take off. Anything you need me to wrap up around here or...? - Yeah, yeah, go. Go. - Hello. - Hey. - Uh... I'm sorry. I just wanted to thank you, and, um, here you are. - That's alright. I was just in the area, so... - So... yes? - Listen, I, um... I just wanted to tell you personally that we're doing everything we can on our end to find out who did this, and, uh, we have some really strong leads. Wouldn't you want to know? - Mmm... I, um... yes. Look, I think I should be getting back, okay? Thank you again for the flowers. Ankhila, um... Tomorrow, I'd really love to help you out, if I can. You know, save time on the bus. Faster and cheaper than a taxi. - Can I think about it? - Yeah. Yeah, of course you can think about it. Carl. Yeah, mate, I'm just about to walk into my sister's place for dinner. What is it? Are you following me? - Alright, let's be adults about this. You want to get in the car? Come on, let's get in the car and let's talk. - Let's talk here. - I, uh... I checked out your theory. Ran it by the boss and then we had a conference with two senior-ranked officers. And? - And you need to know what was passed on to me. Okay. - It stops here. No more. - Who were these other senior-ranked officers, Carl? - Never you mind. - "Never you mind"? - No, no. It doesn't matter. It's a sensitive issue. They would prefer not to be named. - When exactly did this take place? There was a meeting, was there? Yeah, a conference? Yeah, you just gave yourself away, mate. - You're making a habit of going solo, having your own opinions. - I don't like being threatened. - Who's threatening who? - Making shit up to influence me. That's a... And you drove here. I mean, you're smashed, mate. - You're a fucking prick. - Alright. Take it easy. - Yeah, that's right. That's what you are. You're the guy nobody likes. You're the guy in the band that's always complaining. See, we're in a band, right? Like a musical band. Can you imagine that? And when somebody in the band writes a song, like it or hate it, we fucking sing it. And if someone in the band happens to write a fucking shitty song that nobody likes, we keep our opinions to ourselves and sing it anyway. We don't stand to one side and laugh and point and say, "oh! Oh, that's shit. I'm not doing that." 'Cause that doesn't look good for the band, does it? And one day you're gonna go bad. You're gonna write a fucking shitty song. I know it. And then where will you be? On your own, 'cause you're the guy that wants to go solo. You're the guy with the best judgment. Look, he didn't set out to do a bad thing and don't make it out like he did. Victor. Victor, he set out to do a bad thing to that little girl. That's who. Not someone who made a fucking genuine mistake. So use your fucking head. Stop being a prick. - Finished? - Hold that. Ankhila, wait. Ankhila! Level four. Ankhila no. No. - Mal, mal. Listen, I thought you should know. I just found out... That young boy you saved, yeah, he... he passed about an hour ago, mate. Young Indian boy William sarduka. Tragically, today, William passed away in hospital after spending three days in a coma as a result of his injuries. He now becomes the fifth fatality in similar accidents in less than four months. Coming up next on sky news, the latest finance figures and all the sport. Some of us are so focused on our hair that we're blinded to the fact... - I... I, um... I might not seem like a good person, but I have to be a good mother. I think what I said last night... Is right. And I hate myself for saying it. It's... It's horrible, but you've done this to me. You've made me this. - Yeah, I'm just leaving the house. Nah, I got held up. I'll be there in a minute. Is the kid coming? Have you got the plastic top and the shovel? Okay. Okay. Joking. So... What's this all a fucking 'bout? Team talk? - Did you threaten her? - Who? - Did you go and see her? - Be man enough to admit it. Did you? - Well, as far as I know, that's your bag. Yeah. I put on the siren. I was here in no time. So, let's get to it. No more small talk. Brass tacks. Bare bones. To the punch. - Sounds good to me. Yeah, well, sounds good to the kid? Gotta run everything by the kid. No, I'm serious. We're all here. - Okay. So... I'm gonna come clean. But I'm gonna do it in a way so that no one else gets involved or implicated. So I've made up my mind. So that's what's gonna happen. Yeah, well, you sound like you're trying to convince yourself. I just wanted you both to know. - Yeah, well, now we know. Is that it? 'Cause that was worth the trip. You're a fucking scared little prick. You're piss-weak. - I'm not gonna bring you into it. - Oh, sure, like I'm not gonna get Turkey slapped when you drag your little cock to confession. Piss-weak. Oh, yeah, Jim, before you get on your white horse and ride off into the sunset, tell me, because I really want to know... did you fuck her? 'Cause I hope you did. Did you do the funky zebra? Did you make it top deck? Because, you know, if you didn't already, this'll definitely get you into the... Watch out for aids. - Jim! Jim! - Carl, Carl, Carl! Jim, let him fucking go. - Ah... - Let go! Hey! Hey! Oi! Oi, relax! Just fucking leave me alone, for fuck sake. Carl. Carl? - I wasn't choking him. Carl? - Carl. Carl. - Is he alright? - Oh, fuck, Jim. Get an ambulance. - What? - Call an ambulance. Carl? Call a fucking ambulance. - Alright! - Jesus! Carl? Hey, hey, can you hear me? - Ambulance, please. - Carl! Carl! - Yeah. I... - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - I'm gonna have to go pretty soon, but I'll come back again and I'll see you tomorrow. Good. Yeah. - I'm gonna wrap up the whole... Yeah. - Nguyen thing. Then it'll be over and... Yeah. Good. - Hopefully no more gun fights. Good. Yeah. Good. So I'll see you soon, okay? You should go home. Listen, I spoke to the doctor. This thing was gonna happen regardless, they reckon. He wasn't much into health. You know there's no cameras there in the back of tamberine's. I don't want him indicted... Or brought into this in any way. Okay? Just give me a couple of days. That's all I ask. Just once tomorrow's done, yeah? - Hi, mal. - Hey, Manny. You okay? - Good to see your face. - Hey, buddy. How are you? Hey. Julie and Mel aren't here right now, please leave a message after the beep. Hey, William! Hey, William! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Mate! Oi! Sir, can you hear me? Sir? Can you hear me? Sir? Sir, can you hear me? Did someone hurt you, sir? Did someone here hurt you? - Police. Open up. Police. Yes? I called you. I telephoned. - Okay, can you let us in, please, ma'am? - No, no. I- I know him. - Just relax, sir. - I called you. Who else is here? Anyone else here? - Just relax here. It's okay. My niece, nisha. - She didn't do anything to me. - It's okay, sir. - He just came to my door and I called you. - Okay. I understand. So do you know this man? - She didn't do anything to me. - Yes, you know him? - Yes, I know him. - Do you know what's happened to him? - She didn't do anything to me. I just came here. It was me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. She didn't do anything to me. She didn't do anything to me. I just... it was me. Please just leave me. Just leave me, please. - So you're not feeling dizzy or anything? Can you hold that for me? You don't have any blurred vision? Okay. - I'm sorry about this, detective. She said that you had helped her son. Just give me a sec. - You okay? - Come on, sweetie. Whoops. Got it? A kiss. Mwah. - Have a great day, buddy. - Yeah, okay. - Okay? Bye, Jake! See you later!
