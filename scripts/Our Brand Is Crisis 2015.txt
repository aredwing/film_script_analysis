Oh, I got it. - Is that better? - Thank you. Is... Is the sound for both of us good? - It's good. Thank you. - Okay. Right, well, um, when you're ready, shall we start? Jane, good morning. Good morning. Since your early days as a political strategist, you've been known by a certain name, Calamity Jane. Yeah, I've, I've been called a lot of names. Did you ever work for a politician you did not believe in? Oh, sure. I could, I could convince myself of anything if the price was right. There is no coming back from a shot like that. She is on fire. I'll tell you, her opponents are scrambling to keep up with her momentum. How important is honesty? Well, truth is relative in politics. The truth is what I tell the electorate the truth is. In politics, money does talk, and it's about to do a lot more talking. The U.S. Supreme Court now has lifted limits on campaign contributions, ushering in a new era of unfettered political spending. When you began your career, you must've had heroes, role models? Who are my heroes? Well, when I first started in this business, my heroes were politicians and leaders, and then I met them. Look, the bottom line is they have created an inherently corrupt system here. We're talking about a woman who is combative at heart. She's, uh... She's belligerent, she's entitled, and when she doesn't get her way, she makes noise. She's a strategist who can't be trusted. I say give her a glass of wine, and she might spill the truth for once. You had some personal missteps that became very public. I mean, it's almost like car races. No one watches a car race to see who wins. They watch the car race to see who wrecks, who goes up in flames. ...in the wake of serious political scandals. She resigned on Monday after they, uh, filed a criminal complaint accusing her of, get this, violating election laws. She's obviously at the center of a firestorm and huge controversy. No longer idealistic? You know, you need to be idealistic to get into this thing, to keep going, but... You know, once that is gone, there's... There's no getting that back. You know? No matter how hard you try. You can't. You stepped away from your professional and political success for a fight that might not be winnable in this lifetime. How did you get here? What happened? Where the hell are we, Nell? Ready for a deer to jump out. This makes no sense. Who lives out here? How long has she been out here? I don't know. Six years, I guess. Six years? She hasn't run a campaign in six years? You know she's lost her last four elections. And there's the haphephobia. The what? - Don't touch her. - Oh. She doesn't like to be touched. Well, you said you wanted different. - No, I said "unconventional," but... - Oh. I mean, this is a presidential campaign. Ever heard of a disposable? No, what's a disposable? It's what the CIA call an agent who's expendable and deniable. She has no kids, no family, no life. I've seen her take a dead horse and bring in a landslide. - Hmm. - So, if she turns this thing around, well, we did it together. And if she messes it up, that'll be Calamity Jane. It's a presidential campaign in South America, Jane. Bolivia. Very interesting. Uh, economy in real trouble, fragile democracy. It's challenging. Our main opposition is Victor Rivera. He's a deputy in the lower house of Congress, representing Potosi. He's an opportunist. He's a populist, and, well, he's... He's leading the field. I like that hair. Now, our candidate is Pedro Castillo. Born in Bolivia, raised in America. He was actually elected president 15 years ago. Privatized some industries, and wasn't a popular move for him. Mmm. So it was a gringo stickin' it to the Indians. - Right? - Right. - Moving on. - How far are you behind? Twenty-eight points. Where you gonna find someone to take on that shit basket? - Hey, Jane. - Yeah? Did you make this? - This, uh, arts and crafts kind of thing? - Yeah. Yep. It's a medicine bowl. It's based on a Mohawk design. This whole... This whole area was, uh... Was Native territory. Take one. They have protective powers. It's supposed to ward off the evil spirits. Most people use 'em for fruit. That's, um... Let me have the bowl. Well, this is quite a setup. I quit smoking, Nell. Can you believe it? Ooh. Wow. Haven't had a drink in three... Three years. - Oh. - I sleep nights. Some days, I can almost look myself in the eye. You're happy? Oh, I'm better than happy. I am calm. You're a fighter, Jane. Can you look me in the eye and tell me you don't miss it? Don't miss what? Candidates who can't think unless we think for them? No, ma'am. No. You know what it did to me, Nell, that whole world. - Oh, blah, blah, blah. - It's not good for me. Okay. Yeah, well, they're paying very well. I'm sure they are. I know you're struggling. I mean, we're talking a couple of months in La Paz. Oh, well, I get altitude sickness. - Oh, yeah? Well, you live on a mountain. - Yeah. No, ma'am. I live between mountains. I know. I saw it. Remember, I said he had good hair? Mmm-hmm. Look behind the hair. There's one detail that Ben neglected to mention. The opposition has hired their own American. Pat Candy. God, you guys are amazing. Amazing. Unbelievable. What? Oh, come on. He didn't beat you. You beat yourself. And I'm giving you another shot at the title. Light the fire, honey. You wanna go out? Go out. But go out a winner. Damn it, Nell. Castillo is a self-made millionaire. He's known as a conservative senator and a voice for globalization. Sure, there were some problems the last time he was president, but he is back with a new, positive attitude. Just keep that fucking hippopotamus away from me. - No problem. - Okay. It's all about extremes in Bolivia. It's the highest, most isolated country in South America. You know, you got a wealthy urban elite who have been dominating political and economic life for centuries, but the vast majority of the population are dirt poor. Now, they've had decades of militaryjuntas, bloody coups, tanks on the street. I mean, it's no joke down there. During your presidency, there was a lot of social unrest. So if you could go back in time, what would you change? Is there something wrong with her? - You okay, Jane? - Okay, so what is it? What did... What did he do? Try and think. Perhaps all the people who died during the protests? Yes, I... I don't know. Aww! Hola. ...close together. I'm just trying to get off the damn plane. Hi, thank you. Nice to see you. Looking sharp, Buckley. - Oh! - You okay? Honey, honey, honey. Easy, easy. Probably the altitude sickness. We're so high up here, you get low partial pressure of oxygen. Very common with the visitors. - She can't breathe. - She'll be all right. Tell us more about our candidate. Well, Castillo's carrying a lot of history, a lot of bad associations. So the job here, basically, is to take a candidate that the electorate doesn't like, rebrand him, and then sell him, sell him, sell him. Shouldn't be too difficult. Look at those camels. They're not camels. They're, um, llamas. Looks a lot like a camel to me. They are in the camel family. Llamas, alpacas, camels, they're in the same family. Yeah, those are baby hairy camels. Can I put my bag here? It's okay? Can we just go, please? Yeah, but do you want, uh... Can you open your window? - I want you to not speak for a second. - All right. Okay. Sir? Uh, a little heat, please? Ben, how do you pronounce these, uh, indigenous, uh, people? - The... Yes. - The Quechua? - Aymara. Guarani. - Guarani. Constantly protesting. They're pretty much the majority here. I mean, imagine... Imagine there was 200 million Apache back home. Gives you some kind of idea. Excuse me? - Please call him "Senator." - "Senator"? That's what's most respectful. And are we trying the buenos das thing? Um, you know, I wouldn't. Just keep it very American. Pardon me, Jane. The aide always introduces you, so let's just smile and shake hands. Yeah. Don't salute or anything like that. I'm not gonna salute anyone. - Buenos... Buenos das. - Buenos das. Hugo. Ben Sawyer. - Ben Sawyer. Nice to finally meet you. - This is my team. - Hugo Barco. - Richard Buckley. - Nice to meet you. - Ben. - Nice meeting you. - Nell Talby. Such a pleasure. - You okay there? - This is our, uh, specialist, - Jane Bodine. - Are you okay? Jane Bodine. Hugo Barco. Nice to meet you. Senator Castillo, Jane Bodine. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Have a seat. We read the report. It was depressing. So, what's the biopsy? Is it... Is it terminal? Well, if we thought that, we wouldn't have come all the way here, right? We think you could win this thing, Senator. What we'd like to do is start with some focus groups, get an idea of what people are thinking about you, get... Keep going. Keep going. Really, really, really get people in here. You know, go out to the streets, listen to what the people have to say, and tell you. Okay? We are the conduit. We're the syringe that injects the people's voice into your campaign. Meanwhile, I'll be headin' up, uh, media. Online awareness, outreach, TV ads, and so forth. Nell? What we can say now for sure is that the opposition is going to play you as the oligarch. The elitist. So, what we're going to do is invert that. We're gonna show the people that, in fact, you are not the stooge of the corporation, but one of them. We want to show the people the warm, likable Castillo. And that's why we've brought our strategist in, the great Jane Bodine, to give us some insight on how we'd do that. Uh, Jane, you wanna share some of your, uh, ideas on how we would... - I mean, there are many ways. We can... - Uh... Yeah. Um... - You can see here... - Hold on, hold on, just... Just a second. When we were on the plane, she said to me, uh, you know, "Shakespeare once said, 'If you take a great man... "'If you take a great man and cut off one of his hands..."' She is okay? Would you like some water? Okay. I need to, um... I need... I'll be right... She's not... It's... It's the altitude sickness. - Soroche. - Soroche, yes. - Let's go on. - So let's continue. Um... Uh... - How 'bout some water? - Mmm-mmm. I think you should hold off on those chips a little bit, honey. - He's not a winner. - What? Castillo. He is not a winner. You can smell a winner, same as me, and he's not one. Oh. Well, not yet. But that's why we're here. It's gotta feel like you've lost everything, that you have nothing more to live for. And we find you, right in the guts of the favelas, among the disenfranchised and hopeless. Okay? - Does she speak English? No? - Uh, no. Tell the little girl that she stands in front of the slum thing there. And the effect is all fake. She falls backwards through the sky. Castillo catches her. Okay? Okay. What? What'd she say? She say that she doesn't think that he will catching her. He's gonna... He'll catch you. Why would... Why would he not catch you? Why would he not catch you? Oh, my God. Let's go again! Your secret weapon. So secret I forgot she was there. - Suck a duck, Hugo. - You suck a duck. Why'd you make the little girl cry? I can't work under these conditions. You know? And what is she doing? I mean, I've hardly even seen her. She shows up and she's sunbathing? Really? Rich is right. This what Castillo paid for? This is strategy? - This looks unprofessional. - She hasn't lit the fire, Ben. - Well, somebody light the fire, then. - Would you just give her a beat? Light a fire. - What? - She don't go do it, mister. What do you mean? No, he's going to catch her. I promise you. And then she can have some candy. - Tranquilo, is that... - Yeah, that's it. Tranquilo. We're going to shoot the commercial, por favor. That was good. I see you! I've got you! Our proposal will give Bolivia a brighter future. Oh, my God. I know that it will be hard, but together we will triumph. Uh-huh. They have two people that are talking against him. They're saying that he's not trustworthy, he's not reliable. His commercial is horrible. It's technically embarrassing. Basically, he doesn't relate to the Bolivian people. In my opinion, it's totally wrong. - It is unanimous, yes. - So, are we hearing this? Unanimous, finding it a joke, the... The floating down. Well, I had to make it look Bolivian, and like I said, we had a low budget on the effects. Comical. You have to do something to make this guy seem more likable to human beings. It's his smile. - His smile is weird. It's off. - Where is my strategist? - Come on, man. - It's not happenin', you know? It's like the Bush smile. The smirk. He won. Twice. - Karl Rove had to beat that out of him. - And my strategist? Where is my strategist? - She's not... - The commercial doesn't work, obviously. Falling out of the sky doesn't work. - My smile is obviously not good. - Mmm-hmm. So where is she? I'm looking forward to hearing her plan, perhaps before the election is over. What are you doin' out here? Oh, it's the nausea. I don't wanna keep vomiting every time I see him. Can't be good for his morale. - Um, we're strugglin'. - Mmm-hmm. - Nothing's working. - Nope. - That's it? - Hmm. Because if you've got some kind of trick up your sleeve, now is the time to pull it out. This actually kinda matters, Jane. I mean, this country could go under. We're talkin' about people's lives, you know? You don't think there's something kinda odd about him? Sort of checked out? I think he's a client who's paying you to be his strategist. Oh, okay. Do we have a problem? Because if we do, you need to tell me. If there's a problem, Ben, I will tell you. It is unacceptable that our natural resources continue to be looted and exploited illegally. This is something I am determined to stop. They cannot keep stealing from us. My priority is jobs, which I believe is the priority of all Bolivians. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Jobs building roads and building schools, which the Bolivian people desperately need. I'm sure that my esteemed opponents could argue all night long... There she is. Jane Bodine. How are ya, honey? - Pat. - So, what are you doin' here? I thought you retired or gave up or somethin'. No, not retired. Working. Yeah. Okay. - Here lending a hand. - Mmm. Nice. You? Same thing, yeah. I'm just doin' a favor, you know? Yeah, but I'll probably be going home tomorrow, so I won't stay around too long. - No? Yeah, me either. - Mmm-mmm. - Probably gonna get outta here. Yeah. - Mmm. But you good otherwise? - Couldn't be better. Yeah. - Yeah? - Enjoying this dog and pony show? - I'm not one for crowds. - People suck, don't they? - Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. You look tired. - You okay? - I think so. I think I'm good. Why? I don't know. You just look a little beat. What do you think of Rivera? - I don't speak Spanish. - Yeah, me either. - He looks good, though. - Yeah. Yeah. Presidential timber. How about your horse? Seems like a stuck-up little asshole to me. Hmm? Hmm. Anyway, enjoy yourself as much as you possibly can. - I will try. - And, uh... Yeah. - So maybe later, huh? - Maybe. - Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. You know what I mean, right? I can only assume. - Yeah, honey. Okay. Bye. - Yeah. Fuck! Fuck. Fuck! Oh, my God! Well, you're kinda late. I don't know if you've heard, - but we've pretty much gone belly up. - Don't touch me. Are you guys drafting an apology? - Yeah. - Uh, yeah. I... I don't know. Have any of you ever fought against Mr. Candy? No, I know his reputation. He's one of the best. Oh, yeah, well, it was him. It was him. The guy that threw the egg, it was just a put-up job. - Whoa, whoa, what? - It was a put-up job. I know Candy. This is Sun Tzu. "If your opponent is of choleric temperament, provoke him." Do not send out an apology. Jane, I don't know if you missed it, - but Castillo hit someone in the face. - Okay, it was self-defense. - He was attacked. - It was an egg. "Attack your enemy where he is unprepared. Appear where you are unexpected." - It's Sun Tzu again. - I know. I'm just not a big fan of Art of War quotes. - Oh, yeah? Why... Why not? - Because you can use them anywhere. And I don't think that modern democracy has anything to do with ancient Chinese warfare. Yeah, well, no disrespect, Ben, but that's why you're 30 points behind. Okay? And right now the enemy's expecting you to apologize. Well, I don't think of the opposition as the enemy, Calamity. Well, no disrespect, Ben, but that's another reason you're 30 points behind. And the third reason you're 30 points behind is 'cause you guys have Castillo pretending to be somebody he's not. He's not a great actor. Being warm isn't him, smiling isn't him, and apologizing isn't him. But punching someone in the face, that... That's him? Yes, that's him. - Oh, come on, Jane. - Yes. She has a point. Fine. For the sake of argument, Castillo is considered arrogant, unapproachable, - and out of touch with people's lives. - Mmm-hmm. So, what would you have done differently, Jane? Well... "A man's strengths flow from the same well as his weaknesses." Okay. You don't change the man to fit the narrative. You change the narrative to fit the man. - That's excellent. - Thank you, Nell. How can a narrative fit a man? Just take it in a minute, will you? Exactly. "People forget what you say, "but they remember how you make them feel." Warren Beatty. And right now you make people feel like you're gonna shoot them. People don't like you. But that's okay. "Since love and fear can hardly exist together, "if we must choose between them, "it is far safer to be feared than loved." That's Warren Beatty as well. No, it's not. It's Machiavelli. Sorry. I was just totally kidding. Fear. Let's talk about fear. The most effective political spot ever made, "Daisy." Pretty much won the election for Johnson, and it was shown once. Basically, this ad suggested that if Goldwater got in instead of Johnson, the crazy bastard would unleash a nuclear holocaust that would just blow up the world. So now this became a choice between saving the world and dying. You see, when voters are looking for hope, they always go for the new guy. But when they're scared, they look for a wartime leader. They look for a guy who, when you come at him with an egg, he doesn't have time for fun and games. No, he's gonna put you down, and he's gonna punch you in the face! So let me tell you what our little movie is gonna be about. Our story is Bolivia is facing the worst period in its turbulent history. We are at a crossroads, and Bolivians face a choice. They have Rivera, a man of no substance, a man of no experience, an everyman opportunist, who will stand by and watch as this nation falls apart, or they can choose Castillo. You might not like him. You might think he's an arrogant son of a bitch. But he is a fighter. He has grit, he has experience, and he's got balls, and he is the only choice. The only choice to save the day. These are the stakes. We are trying to save people's lives, okay? But this is no longer an election. This is a crisis. And our brand, what we are selling, crisis. Hmm. If this phone rings, do not answer. Everything changes tonight, and this is the tipping point. We have every single major outlet in La Paz... - Right outside the door. - All eyes on you. Do not apologize. But you do regret the incident. And you regret that it's drawn the focus away from the issues that we should be speaking about. The struggle to save our country from the social and economic crisis. - Crisis. - Crisis. Man, can I bum one of these? Can I... Can I take... Gracias. Just... Thank you. Mmm. Fuck. Oh, my God. Is this a cigarette? So bad for you. Hey. Excuse me. Hola. - Do you speak English? - Yes. Are you the guy that jumped in front of, uh, Castillo after the debate? - Uh, yes. - No, no, no. You're quick. You're quick. - What's your name again? - Eduardo Camacho. Eduardo... That's a lot of name. Yes, whatever. Eddie, how about we just... We'll call you Eddie. There you go. You're employee of the month. That's steak sauce. It's really good. I bring it everywhere I go. That one says steaks, but you can use it on all the meats. This guy is George Bush? No, that's, um, Paul Newman, the actor. You know. Fast Eddie. Fast Eddie, like you. Keep it up, okay? And that alone is another fight. "Another fight"? Really? Just cut "another." "This is a fight." That's a fight that you will embrace. Gotta go. Take the jacket off and roll up your... Uh, Ingrid, you'll take that jacket, please. Senator, roll up your sleeves. Once again, indigenous protestors paralyze the capital, demanding constitutional reforms that would give them adequate representation. Candy moved into the room opposite me. Tryin' to get in my head. Which is a mistake. My head being one place you don't wanna get into. Jane, how many times have you gone against Candy? Uh, three or four times. How many times has he beat you? Uh, three or four times. Don't make this personal, okay? It's just a job, Ben. It's just a job. Shirt sleeves rolled up, Senator. Senator. - Thank you. - Yeah, yeah. You're welcome. - I don't think we've met before. - Almost up, Senator. Eduardo Camacho, sir. Actually, we met before, sir. A long time ago, when, uh, they made you president. Plaza Murillo. I was there. - Ah. - I came to see you. - You remember that? - Yes, sir. I remember. I was very little, and I couldn't see anything. And you came and you picked me up. That was a happy day. It will be again soon. No. Keep those for me, will you? And that's why I'm here today: to say that we have a plan to combat this crisis, to overcome this crisis. That's why I'm asking all of you to join me in this fight. For Bolivia, with Castillo! And let me tell you, Bodine is right. The crisis message works. I can feel it with an audience. Maybe with the people here today, but not with the working class. You say "crisis" to them, they hear "tax raise" and we lose them. It absolutely kills me to say it, but that's not a bad point. All right, we can't get comfortable. Don't forget agriculture and... And key industry angles the other candidates are hitting hard. How do we attract votes from people who aren't gonna show up to your urban support rallies? - Exactly. - Look at me. We need to appeal to them through advertising. So I have some storyboards that I've sketched up that I wanna run through with you - as soon as we get back to the office. - Senator. There you are. My cuff links. You know, I think you gave me luck today. What did you say your name is again? Eduardo Camacho. Eduardo Camacho. It's a pleasure. Sir, your car's downstairs. I raise him from he was a baby. Here we go again. I name him Marco after my father. He doesn't look anything like he did in the photograph. He's a far more beautiful creature in person. I mean, his posture's striking. He seems very affectionate, too. Excuse me. Can we get on with the filmings? I have more important things to do. - Dude. Excuse me. - Thank you. More important than harnessing the sentiment of the working class? I don't think so. Sir, I'm sorry. - Rich's process is to get... - Wow. more intimate with the animals. - But it's getting late. - No, but once you see the animals... Just warming up the llama for you, Senator. ...you'll be more of the collective creative process. Once we start shooting, you'll see it'll move faster, so... Walk with me. Rich, why don't you show him some of your shots? So, what I'm thinking is that we open on his face. Gracias. Is that for the headache? The Senator might... And then we do a slow dissolve to you feeding the llama, and then you say, "Llamas supply..." "Llamas. They supply us with meat, with wool, with milk. "With new scientific farming methods, "they can provide the key to Bolivia's economic recovery. "Key to jobs. "For centuries, the llamas led us through the mountains. "Now this animal would lead us to prosperity." - No, that's good. I like it. - That's good. Yeah, I like it, too. Uh, but you'll be saying that walking towards camera, arms slightly away from your hips for empowerment. - Yeah. - And right down the barrel of the lens as you walk. Llamas. They will provide us with meat, with wool, with milk. - Huh? Is that good? - More wrist twits, like a gorilla. Llamas. - You must be kidding. - No, serious. - This is how we win elections. - No. That's how you appeal to the working class. It's fantasy. As if, you know, you're giving them a future. Oh. - What the hell was that? - Was that Marco? Holy shit. Marco! Marco, no! No, no, no, Marco! Marco! Oh, my God! Shit! It's like he killed himself rather than be in one of our commercials. Poor thing. We are rich in petroleum. We have lithium. Uh-huh. Yes. Yes. We have compressed natural gas. What I'm saying is, Bolivia is an immensely rich country. Trying out the crisis message in the polls, sir, there are a lot of people who are saying that you are the only one who understands how bad things are. The message is working. Or, at least, it's stopping the free fall. So I say, now we bet the house on it. We say it on the stump, we say it in our spots, we say it to the press. We own crisis. Crisis. Now, what do you think, Ms. Bodine? Uh, I think you won't win. What? I think you're lookin' at mid-20s. Not enough to win. You're gonna have to make everyone else lose. That is, keeping them under 24%. You gotta go negative. No. No, no. In the last campaign, we used attack ads, and it hurt us badly. And that is why I brought my oppo out. Sarah LeBlanc. Nobody asked you to do that. We already have our own team. Oh, not like LeBlanc. She's the best. No offense, Jane, but if she's the best, how come I've never heard of her? Uh, maybe because she's the best. And who is this people's person? That person is someone who can do as much, or as little, as needed. Listen, Ms. Bodine, I know what it's like in America. I know what you guys do. But here in Bolivia, the people do not like negative campaigns. If we... Ben? Sir, negative ads move the numbers. But it's like settin' off a bomb. You'll take votes from Rivera, but you have no idea where those votes'll go. Let your friend see what she can find. Okay. Will do. Oh, and I'd also like for her to do a vulnerability study on you, sir. I've already been through that. Not with LeBlanc you haven't, sir. You've been doing so badly, no one's been looking too hard. But if you start doing better, the press will start digging. And last-minute surprises will kill. I'm not going to pay someone to investigate me. I already know about me. There's nothing to find out. Oh, there's always something to find out, sir. And that's final. Okay. You are the boss. Do him first. If I can finish this, if you look at this last graph, it shows the three polls... Listen up, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? Everybody! - What'd you just say? - Listen to you. Everyone, we're... Oh. We are gonna do something to Rivera that no politician wants to have done to them. We are going to define him. The attack line is that he's a crook, he's corrupt, he's inexperienced, and he lies. Every day, we are going to ring the big feet, El Diario, La Razn, La Prensa, and we are going to spoon-feed them their Rivera story. We're gonna go through every quote he's ever given, every person he's ever met, every vote he's ever made, and we are gonna look for ways of using it against him. Eddie! Where's Eddie? Eddie! Where are you? There you are. You're my tracker. Okay? Every event that Rivera attends, every speech, you tape it. If security beats you up, you are doing your job right. And get that beating on tape. And if anyone has any qualms about this, thinks it's wrong in some way, you come and talk to me, okay? I will rent you a nice set of balls. Because there's only one wrong in this. Only one, and that is losing. There's only one wrong, losing. Maybe check and see if anyone understood that. Raise your hand if you speak English. Now tell them to tell the people that didn't understand what I just said. Explain it to the others, please. Gracias. Gracias. My God, his hair. It is amazing. Look, it doesn't move. - Close-up. - Yeah. No, no, no, no, that's great. Keep diggin'. It's in there. All these guys have something to hide. I'm sure he's had an affair. I don't know about him, but Castillo did. Well, then let's use that, okay? But don't make it from us. It can't be connected to us. Make it a grassroots something or other. Castillo affair? Rivera! Rivera! Two years ago, Rivera's office purchased 27 Ford Explorers for official use by the district. Sales price was 35K each. These are photocopies of the actual receipts. They claimed 40,000 each. That is $135,000 of taxpayers' money going into someone's pocket. Bad, bad boy. You actually are a crook. - Mmm-hmm. It'd be great if we got shots of his people driving these things, picking up their groceries or pickin' up hookers or something. Wait. Where did you get these receipts? It's a black box op, Buckley. Scooch. Scooch, scooch. Page after page after page. Yeah. All the documentation is there. Did you see it? Here, look at these. So about now, I imagine you've decided that your horse can't win. You brought in that little waif of a high school valedictorian to do all your work for ya. And now you're getting ready to smear shit all over us. Switch your TV on, sweetheart. Hey! Someone turn on the TV. What's wrong with you? What happened? Oh, God. Twin boys. I've seen 'em. Just adorable. I mean, if you're into little pink bags of shit. But you know what I always say, children are a blessing from God, and Rivera has been doubly blessed. Children are a blessing from God, and I have been doubly blessed. So full of shit. A father wants his children to be proud of him. That's why I promise the Bolivian people that I will run a positive campaign. Of course. What's the urgency? It's the oldest trick in the book, sir. It's Candy's work again. They know we have a shot if we go negative. They're just trying to block us. You are not the one out here, Ms. Bodine. If we go negative now, we're going to get the Senator lynched. "He who is not courageous enough "to take risks will accomplish nothing in life." Oh, look. Come on, we don't wanna hear any more Sun Tzu. It is not Sun Tzu. It's Muhammad Ali. Sir, if you wanna win, we're gonna have to take risks. We're gonna have to slash and burn. If you do not go negative, you do not win. Hugo is right. We don't go negative. I've made my decision. - Hey, Jane, one more thing. - What? I think I might have something. Rivera was in the army when he was young. There's a newspaper article that references a photograph of him in uniform. I could try and track it down if you think there might be something there. Never mind Rivera. Give me everything you have on Castillo, okay? Give me something else that's weird. Hey, hey, hey, I think he found it. - Jane. - Act normal. We got a problem. Kind of a major problem. Leaflet says Castillo had an affair with this woman for three years. - What? - Yeah. Louisa in accounting said they were distributing these all over her neighborhood in Miraflores. Then, at the bottom, it says, "Is this the behavior - "of a honorable man?" - "Honorable." "Is this the behavior - "of an honorable man?" - There ya go. "Is this the behavior of a president?" What does that say? "It's time for a change." What does that even mean? It's Rivera's campaign slogan. It must be Rivera. How're we gonna fix this? Gotta go talk to Castillo. What're you gonna say? I don't know yet. - Do we have a plan? - I said I don't know yet. This is the last thing I need. Unbelievable. Really? I'm sorry to bother your breakfast, sir, but I have to ask you. Is this real? Does your wife know about this affair? My wife lives in America, and she knows. - Well, that's not good enough, sir. - This is all part of the past. - That's not good enough, sir. - This does not make sense. Why would they go negative now? They're 20 points ahead. Pat Candy can't help himself. He doesn't care about winning. He cares about destroying the enemy. He is not his enemy. You can't... Yes, it is, Ben! Wake up! This is war! - Enough! - Okay? Sir, I need you to understand this. This flyer makes it real. Okay? With this stamp and these people, you have to understand that the perception of this is that you are an adulterer. It's all about the perception, sir. Your call, Jane. Sir, I think if you... Are you sure it's from them? "La Paz Grassroots Organization"? I seriously doubt that exists. And if you look at the... If you look at the bottom, it says, "Es hora de un cambio." "It's time for change." It's their slogan, sir. They are denying it. But as far as the public is concerned, sir, they threw the first punch. All right. Do it. Okay. As deputy of Potos, Victor Rivera used taxpayers' money to buy twenty-seven SUVs. But he took enough of your money to buy thirty and a half. Where did the rest of your money go? Is Victor Rivera helping you? Or is he helping himself? So I'm lookin' for a club with the girls that put on a good ping-pong show, you know? You know, somethin' fun to do. I don't know if it's 'cause of the altitude here or what, but I guess it affects the, uh... I don't know what... I guess the twat muscles. Pelvic floor? Right. I guess it puts your pussy in a pickle. So, uh, in my travels, I found this great little club. They got a Bolivian Elvis. What do you say you come dancing with me? I mean, come on, honey. We can hate each other tomorrow. It seems your candidate has lost $135,000 of taxpayers' money. Any idea where that might've gone? It's hard to say, sweetheart. Mmm. - Are you taking a leak? - Yeah. Ever since I've been here, I go like 10 times a day. I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you're hangin' on in there, Bodine. I mean, Ben and Nell must've gone to pretty much every consultant inside the Beltway trying to find somebody to help 'em with this turd. Mmm. Nobody wanted to touch it. It's like he's got leprosy. You know how come they eventually came to your door? I suggested you. Through friends of friends, of course. Anonymous recommendation. You know why? I'm training you up. So come dancing. It isn't me, is it, Bodine? You don't wanna go to a crowded bar, do you? You're scared if you spend too much time with our flea-infested electorate here, you'll, uh, have to admit to yourself that you have nothing but contempt for the people that you're supposed to be serving. You'll be on your way home before the last vote's even counted. Me, I don't... I don't see the conflict, really. It's shepherds and sheep, honey. So have it your way. We'll stay in tonight. It's a beautiful night. Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop, pull over. Eddie! Eddie. Hey. What are you doing? Are you headin' home? Yeah? Well, come on. We'll give you... We'll give you a ride. This is not good idea. Why is that not a good idea? What? You don't know where he lives. Well, he's getting ready to tell us. - Snuggle up. - Watch the purse, Eddie. Pepe! Bye-bye. Have a good night. - See you Monday. - Yes, very good. What a shithole. Be well. Okay, let's go. - Thank you. - All right. Take care. Death to the Yankees! Thank you, thank you. What's up, buddy? Those are the Americans that work for Castillo. I've seen them before. They're the enemy and you bring them here? She's the one who gave me the steak sauce. Next time, tell her to give us the fucking steak. Who's winning? - Jane? Wait. - Oh, Jane! Honey, where are you going? Jane, get back in the car. Eddie. This is... This is your neighborhood? It's where you... Where you live? Here? Yeah. Is this your father? Mmm. He died, uh... He and my mother, they died two years ago. In a car crash. Look. - Is that Castillo? And that's... - It's me. - That's you? - Mmm-hmm. So you guys are on your own? Good for you. Uh... I'm sure your father was proud of you. - Huh? Yeah? - Yes. He was very proud that out of all the children, the President pick me up. He was a big supporter of Don Castillo. He said he was the only man who would, uh, run the country. You're a fucking suck-up. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know anything about politics. You're fucking lame. Castillo, he wants to bring in the IMF. You know, the International Monetary Fund. They lend him money. They bail him out. That's what they do. He would never do that. You don't know Castillo. It's like inviting in the embargadores into your house. You know? The lenders. They tell him exactly what to do. They privatize what's... What's ours. They tax the people and we don't have any say on that. Only an idiot would trust Castillo. What did you say? - You heard me. - Fuck, you're talking about your father. Shut your mouth, have more respect. - You heard me. - Shut up. - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. You know, different... Different approaches. Mmm. What're you guys doin' tonight? That's how "Calamity Jane" happened, and it has stuck ever since. And "Calamity" is... It means that, you know, I'm like a disaster. Like I bring a degree of chaos. - A tornado going through. - Yes. This is my underage, judgmental friend LeBlanc. She's not real. And, apparently, she doesn't have a first or a last name either. It's just LeBlanc. How old are you, LeBlanc? Come on, tell me how old you are. I'll tell you how old I am. I know how old you are. I know everything about you. That's creepy. Why would she say that? Sometimes a leader has to do what's good for the country, whether the people want it or not. Now, whether you want it or not, okay, globalization is good. Market economics is good. It's the only thing that'll take you outta poverty. Right? The invisible hand. What? The invisible hand. - No, I know, but... - The invisible hand. Adam Smith, laissez-faire economics. - Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's right. See, exactly. The invisible hand. You know what the invisible hand gives us? That's good. You win. You win. I rest my case. I rest my case. You win. All right, okay. - No, thank you. No, thank you. - It's coca. No, no, I know what it is. No, thank you. We have to work, so we probably should be - leaving soon anyway. - I think that's a good idea. Chicha! What's this? It's chicha. It's corn. Let's do one round. Then we'll leave. I don't know about that. Salud! - A Pachamama! - A Pachamama! Hey, punch your mama. Punch your mama. Hola. I want to... I want to order dinner for four... Four people, please. Bola pe... Yes, hairy balls, delicious. It's gonna be funny. No, just... Just rip the elastic out. - The what? - Elastic. Elastica. No, no, no. That's all we need. - Are you a good man? - I am a good man. - Are you a good man? - He's a great man. - Eddie. Eddie. - You're a good man. Are you a good man? You're a good man. Right? Reload. Psst! Reload. Shh. Okay, reload, reload. All right. Okay. Four klicks to the left. - East. That way. - Which? Okay. - Get further back. - Okay. One, two... Oh, shit. Oh, shit. He's at the window. Don't. Abort it. Abort it. Don't do it. Don't. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit! Stop it. Okay, he's gone. Say hello to my little friend, Rivera. Oh, shit! Uh, could you please call the police for me? I'd like to report an assault. Gracias. Wait, this is my fault! Listen to me. It's my fault. Jane Bodine. "We understand that Seorita Bodine "has received treatment for psychosis in the past. "Could this explain her behavior of last night? "A source close to Rivera's campaign has said..." I drank so much more alcohol than you guys. "Jane has received..." No, "was," I think this says, "connected up to jump cables before"? - That's Pat Candy. - He's such a pig. Oh, Jane. Honey, I am so sorry. Listen. If they want you to go over this, I go, too. Oh, that's such sweet bullshit, Nell. Thank you so much. The Senator would like to see you. I'm sure he would. Jeez. This thing with Candy. It's like they got some Sicilian blood feud goin' on. I mean, did they use to work together or something? I mean, how does somethin' like this get started? He fucked her. Do you mean that literally or figuratively? There was a mayoral campaign years ago. One of Jane's first. Pat Candy ran the opposition. A story started circulating that Pat's candidate's daughter was a coke addict. The poor girl couldn't take it and committed suicide. Everyone assumed Jane started the rumor. Press turned against her and her candidate, and it was over. Finished. Oh... That's awful. At one point in my life, I spent time, six months, in a psychiatric hospital. Uh, they gave me ECT. And I have an ongoing battle with depression. Hypomanic episodes. Thought it was obvious. Only a lunatic would take this job, right? - You are a liability. - Yeah. If you want me to go, I'll go. But I think it would be a mistake. I have what you need now. It's personal. And I am pissed. Thank you, my beloved Bolivian family. Thank you for receiving me here today. A president must be sensitive. A president must travel the whole country, listening to his people. That's why I'm starting this journey today: to listen to those in need, to those who hope for a better future. I spoke to a boy the other day, seven years old... Jane. Pat. I see you're still here. Just come to see you off. Hey, I liked that, uh, leaflet thing you pulled. La Paz Grassroots Organization. So simple, so bad. - Pretty good. - I meant to ask. How'd you manage to run over our llama? Hmm? I promise you that when I am president of Bolivia, this will not happen. I want this boy to go to school and have a future. Did you ever tap for maple syrup, Jane? Mmm-mmm. You gotta pick the right tree, pick the right time. And then, if you get that spile in real good and real deep, that syrup comes running out so sweet. I'm gonna strip the bark off you, Bodine. I'll see ya out there. I want to dedicate this song to my beloved Bolivian people. Some say love, It is a river Hey! Hey! We're done. Let's go, thank you. Some say love, It is a hunger What the fuck? Pablo! Give me that! Stop the train. Where are you? I said, where are you? You were supposed to wait till after the song. What's going on? What the fuck are you doing there? I was just about to cry! Well, I told you to stay with the fucking driver. Yes! Good afternoon, ladies. I came to tell you that we have a crisis in Bolivia. A big crisis: social, economic, and political. This is a socioeconomic crisis. We need action and not empty words! What do you think? This is a crisis of corruption, corruption that's becoming hyper-corruption. I'm here to fight against the corruption. Pedro Ignacio Castillo, he's been our president before, and today he's a new man. We need action and not empty words. But fighting together side by side, we can save Bolivia from this crisis. No, no, no. You don't understand. In this part of Bolivia, people are uneducated. They are not political. You have to hammer the same thing - over and over and over again! - Yes and no. - It's how the message... - I can't take this anymore. What, you gonna walk away like a 6-year-old? - Yes, I am going to walk away. - That's fine. Fine with me. What is with her hat? She got it from a feisty cholita in the clink. - I don't believe this. - What? I don't believe it! That's Candy's bus. You see that bus? You see la busa? Overtake that bus. Overtake that bus. - Wait, Jane. - No. How do you say "overtake"? How do you say "overtake"? P selo a la izquierda! Yes. P selo a la izquierda! Jane, this isn't safe, all right? No, come on now. Jane, what're you gonna do when you catch him? Come on. Come on, come on. No, no, no, don't be safe. You can do this. You'll be fine. Yes, yes, yes! Come on! - Yes! Yes! - Jane! Jane, this is not a game. Hey! Hey! Hey, fuckface! How you doin'? Six points. Six points, you went down. I'm so sorry! But good job, everyone. Keep up the good work! No, no, no! Go, go, go! Please slow the bus down, or let me out! Yes! Very dangerous. Yes. Watch the bridge! Watch the bridge! Watch the bridge! Everybody, hold on! - Yes! - What're you doing? Oh, God. Let me out of this bus! Don't let him do that. You see him? You cannot let him get ahead! Hey, how much would it cost for you to pass that bus? Fuck them. Now overtake that bus! - P selo. - Here. Here! Go, go, go! - V monos! - Go! Go! Go! No, no! He's saying "a cliff." No cliff! No, no, no! No cliff! Go, go, go! Yes. Go, go, go! Take it. Yes! Holy shit! You want something? Put your foot down! Come on! Candy Can! Jesus Christ. - All right! - I give you Calamity Jane! I'm gonna vomit. Jane's got a great ass! Hey. Hey. What's with the, uh, Chinese breakfast? - Japanese. - Oh. I lived in Japan for a little while, and I got used to it. And what were you doing in Japan? - You'll laugh. - No, I won't. I lived in a Buddhist monastery. See? Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. I was doing some work with Free Tibet. I got interested in Buddhism, so I was thinkin' about becoming a monk. Oh. What happened? After carryin' shit for three months and sittin' on my knees five hours a day, I was persuaded to come back to the world and, uh, do some good. Let me know how that goes. Okay? Right. I will. What about you? How'd you get wrapped up in all this? I was helping my father. That's right. Nell told me you ran a mayoral against Candy, right? Mmm-hmm. Joe Shore. Decent guy. He, uh... He looked like Robert Redford. We were gonna save America. Until Pat Candy arrived for the opposition. First thing he did was have this shady local developer make a $2,000 donation to us. Dirty money. Dirty money. Dirty money. Yep. Then Candy leaked the story about his own candidate's daughter being a coke addict, right? Mmm. It was the last time it was about politics for me. What's it about now? Stayin' away from the crowds, and tryin' not to get my hands dirty. Know what I mean? It's understandable. Shit. We gotta go. Hey, Nell. How's it goin'? Uh, we have a matter of some concern here - regarding Castillo. - Okay. Apparently some flyers are being circulated from the Church of the Cosmic Sun. - Wind. - Cosmic Wind. They believe that the leader, Bruce Loomis, can cure them or protect them from... What is it? Basically the fliers implying that Castillo is a member of a cult. - Really? - And it says that the leader of the cult can teach his followers how to fly, that he can predict the future, that he can read minds, and it says, "This is what Castillo believes in. How can we believe in him?" But the best part is that they're in white robes and he's standing there... - There's a picture. - What? ...next to this, you know, hippie guru, kinda Willie Nelson lookin' guy. And there's pyramids all over and hieroglyphic... Hieroglyphics. - How do you say that? - Hieroglyphic. He says there's a flyer going around of Castillo with some cult, wearing white robes. - What? Who's it from? - Who's it from? It's the La Paz Grassroots Organization. The La Paz Grassroots Organization? - What? - The same as the last one, the La Paz Grassroots Organization. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He's so good. He's so good. - And also, Ben, the Wi-Fi is down. - What? Well, we need it. What're you talking about? Ben's not gonna fix the Wi-Fi. Let me call you back. - What are you thinking? - It's Candy. - No, it's not. How can you say that? - It is. I know. I know you don't want to talk about this, but just to make it clear to the audience, are you a member of the Cult of the Cosmic Wind? I was visiting my son. I heard he'd joined this group in California. I was worried. I went to visit him. That's all. "That's all"? Senator, you were standing under a pyramid and you were wearing robes. Everyone visiting had to wear them. I know you don't wanna talk about it, but we have to make it clear that you are not a member of the Church of the Cosmic Wind and that you do not think you can fly. I am not doing a talk show. - Sir... - This is ridiculous. We have important issues to debate... Sir, I realize that, but you have to have a sense of humor about this, okay? You have to show them that. No, I am not a member. And you don't think you can fly? No. If you look at the polls, you'll see I can't fly. Is your son a member of this church? And the truth is, it was your son who was a member. I already said that is something I don't want to talk about. Shut up! But that is why we are here, sir. To face the truth, to face the people. Yes. I know you don't want to go into this topic, but let's start with this: Why don't you want to talk about your son? The truth is when you're a politician, you are a legitimate target. People around you aren't necessarily involved. They don't want to be involved. And you do not... I believe that when you're in politics, you're an easy target. He's saying, as a politician, there's a target on his back. But not all of the people who are close to you want to be participants. But there shouldn't be for the people around him. And that's why I think that they shouldn't be involved in campaigns. Where is Eduardo? I told him I wanted a choice of ties. I don't know, sir. But your son, your son has had his own life. He's had his difficulties. But you love him very much. I will not talk about this. My son has his private life with highs and lows. Difficulties with drugs? Yes. But... He's a very private person, and... I don't want to... I don't want to talk about this. How do I say this? Uh, if you should feel something during the interview, like an emotion... If you have some tears, could you just turn towards the camera? Just... Are you close to your son? No. Not as much as I'd like to be, no. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look at him. - This is it. Oh, my God. Turn, turn, turn. - Yes! Yes. - Oh, my... That was touching. I need some hands, people. I need some hands. Yes. Five points up! Five points up! That's how we do! Five points up! Ben! Buckley! Nell! Five points up! Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of Bolivia! We have come a long way in a short time, but we still have so much further to go. With you, the people of Bolivia, behind me, I know that no one can stop us! Castillo! Castillo! Castillo! It's Nell, yes. What if I were to tell you that there's a photograph of Victor Rivera standing next to that man? Oh, my God. - Who is that? - It's Klaus Barbie. - Klaus Barbie. - Wait, wait, wait. Butcher of Lyon. Nazi war criminal. Murderer of thousands. You have a picture of Victor Rivera standing next to Klaus Barbie? - Well... - I'm confused. So, what's the link? That they both live in the same fucking city? We're not saying there is a link. We're not saying anything. There's no fingerprints on this. This is just rumors floating out in the world. Just some unsettling images. We have Rivera in uniform, and in the darkness, somewhere in the background, there's a Nazi war criminal. - Is there a link? I don't know. - We can't call Rivera a Nazi. - Nobody is gonna buy that. - God, okay, you know what? Lyndon Johnson was running for Congress... - Lyndon Johnson was... - Nell, zip it. Lyndon Johnson was running for Congress and he tells his campaign manager to start a rumor that his opponent fucks pigs. And the manager said, "Nobody's gonna believe that." And he says, "I know. I just wanna hear him deny it." I never knew Klaus Barbie. They are desperate because we're climbing in the polls, and we won't stop until we pass fifty percent. One more thing, polls show you've dropped another three points. I love 'em. They feel good on the skin. - Do they make them out of tortoise shells? - No, I don't know what they do. - They are unisex, though, right? - I have no idea. I need to get me a pair of those. Amazon? - What? - Did you order them on Amazon? I don't remember where I got them. I honestly don't. Those pants, too. Thank... What is this? What is it? What are you doing? Don't stop. Drive through them. - Don't stop the bus! - I told you. I said we cancel these stops. This is dangerous country. We're not gonna convince these people. "These people" make up 60% of the population, so you may have a bit of an issue there. - Turn around. - Don't think that an American can lecture me on racial equality. Where is he going? No. Stop him from... Stop him. Where's he going? Where are the police? Why aren't the police here? - Open the door, please. - Senator! Please calm down. Stop throwing rocks because you've already broken my windshield. I'm not going out! I'm not going out. Why are you protesting? We're asking for constitutional reform so that our people have... We have the same jacket. ...adequate representation. Senator, you must come with me. They're just saying they want constitutional reform. Blah, blah, blah. That he's a professor of economics. Then talk to me, please. I want to listen. Are you thinking about bringing in the International Monetary Fund like President Lozada did? Well, that's a question of... - We're dead. We're all dead. - Hold on. Hold on. If you truly believe in democracy, then practice it here with my people, ask questions. But I do want to listen! I want to listen! He's saying that they want a referendum on the IMF, that they don't want him to call on the IMF without talking to the people first. Because the poorest people are the people who are going to suffer the most. I've learned from Lozada. I won't bring in the IMF without a referendum first. He's saying he's not going to bring in the IMF, that he's gonna have an IMF referendum. No. Jane, he can't make these promises. What's he doing? What was that? It's the other side of him. Because if you defend democracy, you are the voice of the people. If I win the election, I promise... The people will be watching. We'd like to pass through with our bus now. Go ahead, continue. This is a free country. Thank you very much. For freedom and democracy, long live Bolivia! - We're going to be watching. - Thank you very much. And that jacket, I tell you, is very nice. - That's a huge mistake. - Well done, Senator. Is there any coffee left? Are you okay? You know what, Eddie? A leader must be a father to his people. I've always believed that. Sometimes a father has to be strict with his children for their own good. The people back there, they don't understand that. Whatever happens, sir, whatever happens, I'm very proud to be working for you. Gracias. I've spent my life listening to voters from different backgrounds, different countries, and I've learned that they show tremendous wisdom about the choices facing them. You give them the information, and they'll make the rational choice. I think that the people already know what they have to pay attention to. You ever hear such a load of shit? You know, when Adlai Stevenson was running for president, a woman came up to him after a rally one night and said, "Every thinking person will be voting for you." And Stevenson said, "Madam, that's not enough. "I need a majority." Reason doesn't come into it, does it? Am I right? You know, I'm forever hearing stories concerning myself and my Mephistophelian ways. I heard this one a while ago. It was about a mayoral election I ran, way back when. According to the story, I started a poison whisper about the daughter of my own candidate being a drug addict, just so I could blame it on the opposition. Can you imagine? 'Course I never set the record straight. You like to pretend you're not one of us. But we both know who really started that story and ended that young girl's life, don't we? "If you fight with monsters for too long, "you become a monster. "And if you stare into the abyss too long..." Whatever the fuckin' rest of it is. I don't know. Rivera's down to his core. Those voters'll never vote for us. Then we gotta disperse the votes. Get them to vote for somebody else. What about Velasco? No, Velasco's stuck. He's topped off. Only way you're gonna get him more votes is to go out and start campaigning for him yourself. Well, what would that look like, exactly? We'd have to wear masks. If I lose to Candy now, I'm gonna kill myself. I swear to God. I'm not kidding. You're connected, Nell. And now is the time for us to call upon those contacts, those creatures of the political underbelly that make things happen. So, what do you want? You want to take a hit out on Rivera? Oh, God damn it, you people drive me crazy. You pretend like you're this normal person, this lovable mother, this working wife and shit, and that's what makes you so dangerous. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Of course you do. Of course you do. Blackmail, manipulation, sex, embezzlement, extortion, racketeering, all that white-collar crap that you cut with a smile while you make cupcakes for the PTA. - Hey, Jane. - What? Fuck you. What do you want? I just wanna utilize your skill set, Nell. You've used me for what you need. And now I'm being very straightforward with you about what I need. And what I need from you is for you to use your connections. Your other friends. What friends? State Department. You see, Nell, if your enemies' forces are united, you need to separate them. The U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia spoke today about Salvador Velasco. In a speech he gave yesterday, Salvador Velasco repeated his promise that he would stop the U.S. anti-coca program if he was elected. I want to remind Bolivians that we will take every step necessary to eliminate the importation of cocaine. - What is he doing? - ...and if Seor Velasco is elected, the United States will be forced to act accordingly. I mean, is this idiot trying to get Velasco elected? He's appealing to the anti-American sentiment. Velasco's going sky-high. I was going to vote for Rivera, but they're trying to tell me what to do, and now I'm voting for Velasco. Maybe I should hire him to be my campaign manager. If he keeps talking like that, I'll be more than happy. Jesus, Jane. What if he gets too many votes? Did you ever think about that? But I have learned so much from my experiences. - Too slow. Too slow. Pace it up. - And that includes my mistakes... You're on a roll, but you don't wanna lose your foothold. Come on. And that includes my mistakes. And experience is important because the problem... Because the problem is that you're slouching. Stand up. On the level. Come on. Youth. Vigor. Because the problems we face are social and economic, and they are extremely complicated. Okay. Instead of being "too complicated," let's try "too urgent." That turns the question back to our frame. All right. There's a crisis. There's no time. That's what we've been saying, okay? Who gives a shit about what they're askin'? The point is, is how quickly can you turn it around to what you want to talk about? Okay? What do you wanna talk about? Rich, new question. Senator, how do you respond to people who are calling for constitutional reform and greater representation for the indigenous peoples of Bolivia? Well, you do not use a blunt knife for surgery. These people are not educated... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. "These people"? - "These people"? Are you kidding me? - Enough! I've had enough of you. - What the fuck? Have we slid backwards? - Let's take five. Everybody out. - Did you hire me? - I'm sorry? - Did you hire me? I hired you. - No. Nobody hired me. I cannot be hired. Unless you mean in the... You know, the technical sense. Then, yes, I probably was hired. - Let me make this clear to you. - Please do. I am the one running for president. - Okay. - I am the one in charge. - Do you understand? - No, no. See, you're not in charge. You're not in charge. I'm not in charge. Okay? Why can't you understand that? - What did you just say? - Maybe nobody's in charge! Maybe we're all just rollin' down a fucking hill, and there's no one at the wheel. I don't know! Sir, why can you not say what you're supposed to say? - Where is there a problem? - Because I'm not just a puppet - for you to play with! - Of course you are! Of course you're a puppet! As am I! We're just... We're just pawns. My God. To think I took a chance with you. - To think that I believed... - No! I took the chance on you. - You are nasty. You are a terrible person. - No. I am a good person. But the means justifying the ends, and the nasty, terrible things that I've done, I have done for people like you. So now you owe me. I am this close to winning this thing, and I'm not gonna stand here and watch you ruin it. I'm not! You need help. You need professional help. - Jane. - Pat. - What are you reading? - Goethe. Oh, the German theme. - How is the Fhrer? - He's good. Yeah? Thought he'd be at home injecting the twins with smallpox or something, ready for the next media blitz. No, he's just getting ready to beat your guy tonight in the debate and assume the presidency. But I have to say, you've really done something amazing here, Jane. I mean, you took a people who were looking for hope, desperate for change, something new... The strongest brand there is. And you've got 'em turning back to some old guy who had 'em shot the last time he was in office. Something good? "It may be possible to hold power based on guns. "It is far better to win the heart of a nation." That's nice. So listen. When this is all over, I mean, no matter which way it goes, when we get back home, I'm gonna spend hours pleasuring myself, thinking about you. Hmm. That would be an honor, Pat. Thank you very much. Let me tell you one thing: With age comes wisdom. To run a country like this, with all its problems, with all its complexities, to put this country in the hands of the inexperienced, it's a fatal error. What you see here this evening is, indeed, what you always see in the course of this campaign: candidates who are more interested in fighting with each other instead of fighting the crisis that is destroying our country. What do you think? I think Rivera went to a charm school that we've never heard of, because he's got the whole package. He's relaxed, he stays in control, he connects. Castillo? Just not his thing. A great man once said, "It may be possible to hold power based on guns, but it is far better to win the heart of a nation." Great quote. All right, I need a Vicodin. That was awful. Let's go start spinning some cotton candy. Even the tenor of his voice, do you know? - Let's go. - This is like a... - What do you think, Jane? - I'm gonna catch the end. But, listen, when you go to press, will you do me a favor and put them right on something? I made a mistake. I told Candy that that last quote was from Goethe. Who was it from? Uh... Joseph Goebbels. - Who's Gribbles? - Goebbels. Hitler's closest associate, the Minister of Nazi Propaganda. Well played. Election day has arrived, and record voter turnout is expected.

Castillo, Rivera, and Velasco. The Bolivian people are continuing to vote with enthusiasm. Looks like it might go to Rivera. He's waiting with prayer and contemplation. We've gotta look at the big picture. Rivera and Velasco supporters, they're talking about how they've formed a strategic alliance in order to battle colonialism. She says they might divide the voters who seek actual change. ...reporting live from the Presidential Palace here in La Paz. Until weeks ago, the election in Bolivia appeared to be a landslide in the hands of Victor Rivera. But recent polls show a massive surge of popularity of former president Pedro Ignacio Castillo, who brings an aggressive global economic... It closes in two hours. Pando hasn't come in yet, either. What about Sucre? Do you have it? Rivera. I'm voting for Castillo, no matter what my family says. I like him. Muchas gracias, seor. The Rivera camp is getting really nervous right now. The polls are coming in, and Castillo is in the lead. Bad news for Rivera and Velasco. - 27%. - Yes! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, wait. Yep. - Good, good. That's us. That's us. That's us! - That's us!

What's up? Just wanted to say congratulations. Nell said you were the best, and I should have believed her. I think she said I was a disposable, didn't she? Doesn't matter. It's all good.

Okay. I saw Castillo. - Hmm. Yeah. - He was talking to the IMF. I heard. He said a referendum. - Mmm-hmm. - He promised. Yeah. Yeah, he did. He lied. That's the world. That's politics. That's how it works. It starts out with big promises and ends up with jack shit happening. But like the man said, "If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal." Do you want me to stay here with you and pretend like I can take care of every tiny little problem? Is that what you want me to do? I don't decide the man's policies. I cannot monitor his behavior after the election. That is not my job. Can't make him a good man. People will get hurt. Well, you know what? Getting hurt is unavoidable if you wanna play this game. It's just what happens. You say all these things that people say, Jane. But what do you do? What are you gonna do? "Third item. Uh, "Interest rates, um, to be raised to 18%.

Not me, I'm too sensitive. Where are you headed next? I got the Brits. At least the Brits don't block the goddamn road. Pepe! Pepe!
