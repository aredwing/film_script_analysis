She's having a complete placental abruption. - What's wrong with my baby? - Your placenta has dislodged from the uterine lining. Which means your baby needs to come out right now. Do you understand? I'm going to perform a c-section. Okay. Call o-ops, tell them we're coming down. - Doctor Hamilton.. - Oxytocin's not working, can you.. - Doctor Hamilton. It's not her. It's you. - Oh, shit! No! Oh, shit! Uh! - There you are. Welcome to UNST. Thank you for doing this. I know adopting in America would have been easier, but.. - I just want a baby. - Come on. Let me make you breakfast. Come on. Then I'll show you around the island. Beautiful, eh? - Hey... What are these things? I see them all over the island. - You mean the runes? - No, these, these carving things. - Not ruins, I said "runes." It's old viking script. And you'll have to watch yourself as you might have people make fun of your accent. - I don't have an accent! - Spoken like a true American. Right now.. ...we're north of the last inhabited house in the UK. The closest train station. It's 300 kilometers that way, in Norway. - Really? - Yeah. I used to come here when I was a kid. It felt like the end of the world. - What's that? - Oh, that? That's-that's Tronal island. That's where we'll be adopting our baby from. Are you okay? - I just hate not knowing why. Excuse me. I'm-I'm looking for doctor Wickliff's office? - Oh, he's on the third floor. Just that way. - Thank you. - This is quite a CV. - Thank you. - I think you might find things a lot quieter here at Saxa Vord than you maybe used to. - Well, I hope so. - So how soon would you like to get started? If you need a week or two to settle in.. - No, actually, I-I'd like to keep busy. - Idle hands are the devil's playthings, eh? - Something like that. - We act as a fully functioning hospital and all out patient treatments. We have oncology, pediatrics coronary care, there's even a psychiatrist on call. And then anything long term, they transfer to Lerwick. And this is your office. - Oh... Nice. What's in that wing? - Upstairs is dental, downstairs physiotherapy and a burns unit and then in the basement we have the mortuary. - Oh, you certainly pack it all in. - Well, you have your father-in-law to thank for that. He prided himself on the care he provided. He said, "just because we're an island doesn't mean people don't deserve the best." - Oh, yeah, there he is. - Is that the heartbeat? - Yes. - A toast to my only son and heir beautiful wife and to my future grandson. - Cheers! - Cheers! - It's good to have you back, Duncan. And, thank you, Tora, for bringing him. - No, thank you, Richard for everything, for the house for my job, for... The adoption. - It's what families are for. Anything you ever need, please don't hesitate to ask. - How are you finding the islands dear? - I think they're beautiful. - And the hospital? You're settling in? - Ken treating you well, I hope. - He's a prick. - Oh, Duncan! - Why would you say that? - Because he's licked dad's ass since we were kids. He's modelled his entire career on him. - You're criticizing the man for knowing what he wanted? - Who's for pudding? I made your favorite, Duncan. Cranachan. - You spoil me, thank you. - Tora, um.. ...why don't you go and help Elspeth with the coffee? - Not too much sugar, sweetie. - Oh? Why is that? - Cause I had too many New York slices got to lose a few pounds. - Oh! - Nonsense. The world's gone diet mad. - Oh, who's this? Is this you? - No, that's Duncan's mother, rose. She died shortly after Duncan's birth. - And is that the library? - No, dear, that's Richard's study. - Your dad doesn't know you're diabetic, does he? - And burst his illusion that Guthrie men are perfect? - And here we are. Tronal international. - It's amazing to think this is all just maternity. - You'd be surprised how many women need sensitive solutions to unfortunate or ill-timed pregnancies even this day and age. And with us, we guarantee their baby will be well cared for. That's one of the reasons they come to Tronal. - What's the other reason? - Anonymity. - So, who provides your obstetrics support? - We have a resident Ob gyn. A fellow of the royal college. He has six fully qualified midwives working with him. So, I can assure you our clients are well cared for. - Would you like some tea? Or a dram of whisky? - Uh, no, thank you. - I'm sure your father explained the process. You're set up with bank accounts and jobs here on the island. - Uh, why the twelve months before we can adopt the baby? - Well, that's to settle any residency issues with the Scottish government. We don't go giving our wee nippers to just anyone. No, there's just the matter of some filing fees and we can get you on the waiting list. - Is that your son? - Aye. - He's very handsome. - Thank you. We adopted him from Tronal, actually. - Really? He's not yours? He has your eyes. Oh, no. - At the tone, record your message. To end, please hang up. - Hi, this is Dr. Hamilton. I'm going to need someone to cover my morning patients. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. - Tora Guthrie? Detective inspector Mckie. - Hi. - This is d.S. Tulloch. - Hi. - What can you tell us, Steven? - Well, at first glance, what we have here are the remains of a female aged somewhere between 25 and 35 years of age. Her skin has been tanned by the peat, but from her bone structure and the shape of her skull I'm pretty sure that she's Caucasian. - What are those markings? - They look like runes that have either been carved or branded into the flesh. From the position, I say they couldn't have been self-inflicted. - You sure about that? - Sure as I am.. ...that she didn't die of natural causes. - I had no reception. Are you okay? - Did you hear that her heart was cut out? Gives me the creeps to think of her lying downstairs right now. - What are you doing? - Dr. Hamilton, you shouldn't be in here. - I'm sorry. I, I just.. You do realize this woman gave birth shortly before she was murdered? - This is a police investigation. - No, that's okay. Go on, doctor. - The uterus contracts.. ...between one and three weeks after delivery depending on the age of the mother the younger the woman, the faster this happens. In my opinion, this woman gave birth between a week to ten days before she died. - You're sure about that? - Well, if you look here, you can see that that she was nursing. - Is she right? - Hm, it seems your talents are wasted on the living, Dr. Hamilton. - So, what do we have so far? - We only know that the victim's rib cage was split open with some kind of blade and that she died of a massive hemorrhage when her heart was cut out. - Why take the heart? - Maybe someone was trying to harvest her organs. - This was no harvest. Pulmonary trunk and semi aorta were both quite badly hacked out. Also, there's trauma on the wrist the upper arm and the ankle. Probably from some kind of restraints. - So, she was probably still alive when they did this to her? - Jesus! - Oh, these islands were rife with this sort of thing way back when the druids, the Norsemen.. They all performed ritual sacrifices. - Do you think she's that old? I mean, she looks so... - preserved? Well, she's a bog body. Buried in peat. After death.. ...putrefactive bacteria secretes digestive enzymes which decompose the body, but.. ...sphagnum moss in the peat chemically reacts with the enzymes and immobilizes them. - If you have to guess? - I found.. ...these strawberry seeds in her stomach. Wild strawberries haven't grown around these parts in over 200 years. - 200 years that.. ...hardly seems possible. - Google Tollund man. Dug up some time in the '50s. He was in such good condition that the Danish thought that he was some recent murder. Turns out he was from the 4th century BC. - Ah! - Hey. What are you doing? - Oh, I.. All this wood's rotten I've got to throw it all out. - What happened? - Builder in the village said there was a-a flood a couple of years ago, some big storm and the whole area was underwater for three days. Seriously, I thought this place would be a nice 12-month flip. - Need a hand? - You with a hammer? No. Can you get me some pizza? - Thought you were off the slices. - Yeah, well.. - Hey.. ...when did you say this happened? - Uh... Early 2012. - Are you sure? - That's what he said. Why? Tora! - Already did a thorough autopsy, Dr. Hamilton. - What's going on? - If the peat bog floods, its preserving abilities become diluted. Just take a look at the dates. - So, if Jane Doe was in the ground before the storm her body would be in much poorer condition than it is. - The case is closed, Dr. Hamilton. - Okay, well, what if I'm right? What if she was murdered less than three years ago? - You're not! - Okay, so you're going to turn your back on a sacrificial murder? - Now, you listen to me, and you listen to me good. Sacrificial, satanic, ritualistic. They're all words I don't want to hear. - If you want someone dead you slit their throat or you put a pillow over their head. Maybe you blow their brains out with a shotgun but you do not do what was done to that poor girl and I don't care what you call it. - What are you doing still standing there? - Well, what do you expect him to say? He's just trying to keep a lid on things. Tora, you've got to let it go. - There is one question nobody's asking. - What's that? - What happened to the baby? - Tora.. - So when did you find it? - This morning. But I'm pretty sure I haven't worn those boots since that day. - "Z.M. And J.H." - Zoe McClaskey and Joss Hawick. - Councilor Hawick? You must be mistaken. - Well, I checked the island records. You know how many women whose names begin with z have been married on this island in the past 50 years? - No. - 3. How many Z.M.s? 1. Plus there's a child and his age fits. - Okay, I'll look into it. - That's all I ask. - Hey. How are you feeling? - Oh! I'm fine. - That was a terrible thing, you finding that body. You're tense as hell. - Yeah. Duncan. - Guthrie! I was wondering when you were going to show your face around here. - Get your hands off my wife. - Just being friendly. - What are you doing here? - Lunch, remember? - Right. - So, you know you've got nothing to worry about with Ken, I mean.. - No, I know, I know, I just saw his hands on you, and I.. Hmm.. Hang on. Yeah, it's me. - Are you writing to the Trowey folk? - Who? - The grey fellows. - Are you talking about these? - Aye. - What? You know what these are? - Trowey marks, sure. - I'm sorry. What? What's a Trowey? - The trows... - Jimmy! Leave the good doctor alone, will you? - No, no, it's okay. Really. Can you read these? - Aye. - Jimmy! Away with you. Sorry about that, doctor. He'll not bother you again. - The trows, eh? Now, why on earth would you be asking about these old stories? - Oh, just curiosity. - You want to be careful. You know what happened to the cat. I'm just joshing. Are you going to tell me why this sudden fascination with our local folklore? - Well, have you ever seen.. ...these? - These are from the body you found. - How do you know that? - Because Andy Mckie already asked me to translate them. What are you doing with them? - Well, I just.. ...can't get them out of my head. I wanna know what they mean. - Well, therein lies the rub. They're not from the Norse runic alphabet. So as far as I can tell, they don't mean anything. - I met a guy in a bar. Um, Jim somebody. He said he could translate them. - Jimmy McNally? - Yeah. - Well, I shouldn't set too much store by what he says. You know we do have a police force here, you know, Tora. It may not be much of one, but, um... It works for us. - You're looking really good and I'll be seeing you in a month. And you get some rest, okay? Oh, sergeant Tulloch. Come in. - So, how bad is it? - You're six weeks along. - Shit! Sorry. Not the reaction you usually get, I'm sure. - Well, it's early days. You still have options. - No, I don't. - I'm going to write you a prescription for some pre-natal vitamins. - I was praying it was stress. I should be so lucky, right? Thanks. - Sergeant. Is there any news on the case? - Oh, right, um, I spoke to councilor Hawick. He wasn't happy, obviously, but I showed him the ring. He denied that it was his wife's. Said hers was buried with her at St. Magnus. - So, she is dead. Three years ago. Some sort of horse riding accident. - So, the time of death fits. If she had the boy within two weeks of her death... - she didn't. Mr. Hawick adopted his son, as a newborn about 8 months after Zoe died. - What about the initials, though? She's the only one on the island that fits. - Maybe that's the problem. We get thousands of visitors here every year. They trample all over this island. Any one of them could be the z.M. That lost the ring. Probably there's nothing to do with our Jane Doe. - What? So, that's, that's it? - We have no ID. The case is closed. Look, for what it's worth, I looked through our database for the last 3 years and nobody matching Jane Doe's age or height was reported missing. - Well, what if she wasn't reported missing? - Then I don't know what database to look through for that. Thanks. - Oh, dear. - Doctor.. ...would you let me get that for you? - Oh, would you? Thank you. - Yeah? No, I'm here. Yeah, hang on. Okay, got it. Don't worry, it's been taken care of. - Okay, Zoe. Let's see if your husband was telling the truth. Let's try women between the ages of 16.. ...and... 34. Shit! Oh, shit! Ah! Shi.. Get off me! - Did you see the man's face? - No. But it's pretty clear he didn't want me getting out of there with that X-ray. - You stole this from the mortuary? - I took it to see if I could find a match. And then Stephen Renney showed up and took the rest of the autopsy file. - But that's evidence, that doesn't make sense. - Oh, it will. It will when you see who Jane Doe is. - Theresa Renney? There must be a mistake. - Why? - 'Cause Renney's wife died of ovarian cancer in October 2011. There's no way she had a child. You must have grabbed the wrong X-ray. - I didn't. Look, I don't know what's going on here but you now have a positive ID, so the question is what are you gonna do with it? - I'll do the talking. You found these on the corridor floor and ran a search to match for filing, okay? - Sure. - Sir, some new evidence has come to light. - Ah, sergeant Tulloch, doctor Hamilton. You both know Stephen Gair. - Hello, Tora. How's Duncan? - He's fine. - If you don't mind, sir, we need a private word. - There's no need for that. I filled him in on what's going on. - Is that right? - Last week a body was found in your land, Tora. And my sympathies, by the way. The body was that of a young woman who was brutally murdered a long time ago and whose remains are probably destined for the museum of natural history. Yet despite the coroner's findings the two of you have engaged in an unethical possibly illegal, comparison of dental records. I believe you found a match to doctor Renney's late wife, Theresa. - How do you know? - It's a small island. - The problem, Mr. Gair, is that now we've revised the estimate of time of death. - It's irrelevant. Whether your Jane Doe died last week or a thousand years ago.. Theresa was under the supervision of the finest doctors at Saxa Vord when she passed. She was then cremated. There were over 50 people at her service. Including Mckie here. - That's true. - You seem very sure of Theresa Renney's medical records. - That's because my own wife passed away right around the same time. It was a very hard time for everyone. - I'm telling you he's lying. - Oh, Tora. - Stephen Renney may have murdered his wife. That doesn't bother you? - Yeah, w-yeah, of course, but.. How could Renney's wife be the body buried in our field when everybody saw it being buried in the graveyard 6 months earlier. - I don't know. - And how could she have a baby when she's riddled with cancer? - Well, obviously, she couldn't. - Well, is it possible that he faked her illness? - You can't fake stage 4 ovarian cancer. - Well, here's, here's a bigger question. Why would he do it? - I don't know. - Duncan! - Yeah, look, darling, I've got to go, okay. I'll see you back at the house. - Okay. - Bye-bye. - You can leave your bags over there, Suzie. Can I help you with something, Dr. Hamilton? - Were you working here 3 years ago? - No, I wasn't. I'm sorry, did you want me to call doctor Wickliff? - No, it's okay. - Now, remember, she may not look quite herself. Your mother's lost a lot of weight due to the chemo. It's okay, come here. - Everybody knows that Theresa Renney died of stage 4 ovarian cancer, right? - Correct. - So how could she be in the hospital and buried in my field? - She couldn't. - Exactly. - So what if Theresa Renney was never in the hospital? - What do you mean? - Have you ever been to an oncology ward? Some of the victims are so badly ravaged by cancer that their own families barely recognize them. - Are you saying he switched his sick wife for someone else? - I'm saying Theresa Renney was never even sick. - But why go to all that risk? There wasn't even any life insurance. Her death cost Renney money. - What if it wasn't about the money? What if it was about the baby? Just... Just take a look at this. - "The Kunal trows?" You know these stories are told to wee bairns. - Not this version. This was sent to me by an expert at Oxford university. - "The Kunal trows were a patriarchal warrior race "of Shetland males who believed themselves stronger "healthier and smarter than ordinary men. "Unable to beget female children to reproduce with "the trows selected human females to marry "and the babies born of these unions "were always strong healthy sons. "Then nine days after delivery and the trows having no further "use for them, the mothers were sacrificed by having their hearts cut out." - "As part of the burial ceremony, the mother's corpse had sacred prayers carved into her flesh." - The details are remarkable, but.. - Well, the guy from Oxford thinks that the trows were a real religious sect. - Real? - Yeah, what if they still are? - And, what? You think Stephen Renney is one of them? - I don't know. - Yeah, well, I do. Look, it's the 21st century and nobody would believe this stuff. It's crazy. - All I'm saying is, there is something weird going on on this island and you can't just ignore this. - Oh, it's Mckie, I have to get back. I'll see myself out. Look, I'm sorry Tora, but... It's a small island and a group with the kind of power you're talking about.. ...they just couldn't hide. - Ah, doctor, can I get you a drink? - Actually, do you have an address for Jim McNally? - Drunk Jimmy? - Yeah. - Aye. I-I'll get you a pen. Aye. She's here right now. Asking about Jimmy McNally. - How was work? - Exhausting. Had a problem with some of the machinery. Go back to sleep. - Inspector Mckie. - Dr. Hamilton. What are you doing here? - I was passing by, I saw the ambulance. Can I be of any help? - Well, not with this one, I'm afraid. - What happened? - Drunken idiot must've fallen off. - How do you know he was drunk? - Old McNally, you have a hard time finding him sober. - Some of these roads are treacherous after dark, doctor. You'd do well to remember that. - So... What's so important we couldn't meet at the station or your office? What's this? - Members of the Shetland rite. - And these dates next to them? - Those are the dates their first wives died. - And the stars next to that? - Those whose baby either survived the mother or who adopted a son within 9 months. - Your husband's father's name's on this list. - I know. - What you're suggesting takes planning and money. Lots of money. Password protected. - What's that? - Got it from a hacker back in Dundee. - Oh, I should get one of those. Did you find anything? - Nothing stands out in Renney's accounts. They look in order, but.. ...hang on, what's this? Three payments from Gair's account to something called the Cathy j Morton trust. - Who's that? - I don't know, but they add up to over 300,000 pounds. Look at the dates. - September to October 2011. - Right around the time Theresa Renney reportedly died. - Shit! That's the cops. Jesus, what are you doing? - Go out the back way. - What about you? - I'll be fine, just go. - Dana? - That took forever. - Well, what did you tell them? - That I saw some kids leaving the building and that it looked like a burglary. - Anyway, I ran a check on Catherine j Morton. Guess what she died of? - Ovarian cancer? - Stage 4. Exactly the same as Theresa Renney. Anyway, I'm driving up to Oban now to talk to the family to show them a picture of Stephen renney if I hurry, I should make the last ferry. - Okay, look, Duncan's here. I should go. So call me when you talk to them. - Go around, dickhead! - Dana, you okay? - Some arse thinks he owns the road. He just hit me. - What? - He hit you? - What's going on? - He's following me. - Well, pull over. Let him pass. - No. I'm not stopping in the middle of nowhere. - Dana? Dana. Dana! Dana! Dana! - That was Mckie. They still have no leads. - They should ask Stephen Renney where he was last night. - Tora, you've got to stop this. - What if it was me out there, you would stop? - That's an American accent, isn't it? - Uh, New York. - We went to Florida last year with the nippers. Disneyland. Or is it Disney world? I always get them confused. - Yes, it's an easy mistake. - Here, you, never mind her. Just eat your breakfast. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude but who did you say you are? My name is Dr. Tora Hamilton. I'm here on behalf of detective sergeant Tulloch. Who I believe spoke to either you or your wife on the phone. She was inquiring about your sister-in-law. - I thought nobody was gonna be coming. - Who told you that? - Look, Mrs... If you're not a police woman then we don't have to answer anything. So if you'll excuse me, I've got to go to work. - Okay, mark. May I call you mark? - You can call me whatever you want while you're leaving. - Well, if I walk out that door the next knock you hear will be the police and they'll be asking you all about the Cathy Morton trust and how a single income family living in a house like this are able to drive a brand new BMW and taking Florida vacations. - It all started when Stephen saw her in the local paper. They'd written a small story about ovarian cancer. He said he wanted to help. - Help? How? - She was very ill, in bed all the time. Mark thought she needed to be in a hospice. - It was bad for the wee nippers. Seeing their mum like that. - He made her an offer, to take part in some trials of a new drug and in return the drug company would set up a trust fund for her children. - It gets released monthly for things like school uniforms and child care. We get none of it, you understand. - So what happened after she agreed? - Stephen paid the first installment like he promised. And they came for her. - Who came for her? - An ambulance. A nurse. I don't really remember. It all happened so fast. - Where'd they take her? - We don't know. - Did you not go visit her? - She died a few days later. - Oh, what about the body? Did you go to the funeral? - There wasn't one. - He said that had been part of the agreement. Cathy's body would be used for research. - How do you explain that to your child? - So after Renney took her away you never saw your sister again? - Who? - Stephen Renney. - Who's that? - I'm sorry. Who are we talking about? - The man we were dealing with was a lawyer. Stephen Gair. - Look familiar? - Should she? - Her name is Cathy Morton. Now she's the woman who you all watched die of ovarian cancer. Not... Melissa Gair. - Uh, what are you talking about? - What I'm saying is that Melissa Gair is your Jane Doe. - This is preposterous. - Money doesn't lie. - Where'd you get this? - From Dana. - I wish we could hear what his lawyer's telling him. - Whatever it is, he doesn't look happy. Right.. ...let's get back in there. What's she doing here? - She refuses to leave. - Put her in my office. Give her a cup of tea or something. My daughters. - They're beautiful. - Aye, they take after their mother. Please, take a seat. I don't normally include civilians at this stage of an investigation. But in your case, it seems only fair to tell you that Stephen Gair gave us a full confession. - What did he confess to? - Well, the murder of sergeant Tulloch for starters. He knew his computer had been accessed. And he was worried in case she was, uh.. ...figuring everything out. - About the Shetland rite? - About his money laundering scheme. - What? - He murdered his wife Melissa because she was threatening to expose him. Unless he paid millions in the divorce. Knew the house was empty. He kept Melissa there until she gave birth.. ...then he killed her. - That can't be right. This is a cult murder. What about the markings? What about the missing heart? - All done to throw us off if the body was ever found. He said he got the idea of switching bodies, carving her up cutting out her heart, from a local legend. - He claims he did this alone? - That's right. - Well, what about Theresa Renney's x-rays? - Planted by Gair. When Renney found out, he panicked. - Alison Gair is here. - Right. Well, I hope this, uh gives you closure, Dr. Hamilton. And, uh, I'd appreciated you keeping what I've told you between us for now. - What happened to Melissa's baby? - Gair faked an adoption. - Does his current wife know? - Not yet. - Mrs. Gair. - Hi. - What's all this? - It's an apology. I heard about Stephen Gair. I should have listened to you. - Just.. Answer me one thing. The other night, you weren't at work you went to a meeting with the rite. - You followed me? - Just tell me why you lied. - Well, it's supposed to be a surprise dad's organizing a big party for us when we get the baby. Why? Wha.. When did you.. - Why don't you hold him? - Me? - Of course. - Come here. When can we take him home? - We monitor the babies for nine days just to make sure there's no medical complications. And to finalize all the paperwork. - You, hello. Thank you. - You're a natural. - Great to see you again. Tora, you look absolutely lovely. - Oh, thank you. What a beautiful party. - Do you mind if I borrow my son for a moment? - Not at all. - Lady of the hour standing alone. Well, that won't do at all. - Ken, are you alone? - No, I'm with my son, Hamish. - Oh, he's very handsome. Have any more hidden away? - No, I think you'll find that, uh one UNST boy is quite enough. - Oh, duty calls. - Steven. - Hello. - Hi. - Tora, may I introduce Mr. grey? - Oh. - Congratulations on your adoption. I'm sure you'll make a splendid mother. Right, well, I'll just go and see if Elspeth needs a hand with anything. - Excuse me, Elspeth, have you seen Tora anywhere? - No. - Ah. Woah! Hey, easy there, jumpy. Everybody's been wondering where you are. - What? - Where's my son? Duncan, old son, where are you? Duncan, you're wanted. Duncan, the honor is yours. - Tora! Tora! - Stay away from me. - Where're you going? You can't run from this. - You're one of them. - I'm not, if you couldn't give me a son they were gonna kill you to make room for someone who could. - But we tried. We tried so hard. Even though you knew what they would do to me! - I knew you'd never go to term. - What? How could you know? - How? How did you know? What is this? - It's an unapproved male contraceptive. - This is what you've been taking? - Yeah. - Are you even diabetic? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. All this time you let me think I was the reason we couldn't have kids when you.. ...you were stopping us. - I was protecting you. - Protecting me? - Yeah. - You robbed me of my chance to be a mother! - Do you think I don't know that? I had four miscarriages 'cause you were taking this shit! - And if you hadn't, you'd have been a mother for exactly nine days before they cut your fucking heart out! Is that what I should have let happen? Tora, wait! D-don't you get it? I do nothing, you die. I get you pregnant, you die. So I made a deal. We adopt one of them.. ...they let you live. - And who's the mother? - Grey is coming. - I need to tell him that you won't talk. - Who is she? - Tora, please! - Who is she? - It's Dana. - Dana's alive? She's next? - There's nothing you can do. Tora! Wait! Don't! Tora! Tora! No! Nobody hurts her, that was the deal. - You were only allowed to break tradition if you could control her, you couldn't. If you weren't Richard's son, I'd finish you right now. Nobody... Hurts.. ...my... Wife! - She's taken one of the boats. - Dana? - Dan.. - Talk to me. - I have men searching the island for her. I don't think she's in the building. - I don't pay you to think. - Well, we'll just have to keep looking. She must be here.. - Duncan, what are you doing here? - He's looking for his wife. - No, no, no, no. - I... I came to warn you. I... I couldn't reason with her. - She's here. - I know. - Sir, I think you'd better see this. - She's found the ward. Go! - Dana? Dana, wake up. Wake up! What is this shit? Dana, can you hear me? Dana? - She's not down here. - I'll wait here in case she doubles back. - I don't care who does what. I just want the bitch found, okay? - I'll deal with your wife, and when I'm done maybe I'll take care of you. - He's gone. - How did you know? - I bought you that perfume, you remember? Wake her up. Go, go. - It's okay. - No, it's this way, to the lighthouse. Come on. - Okay. Come on. - Wait. Please. My son. Please. - You go to the boat. - No, I'll go. - Would you even recognize him? I'll be right behind you. - Tora, no! - Jesus! I'm... I'm sure it's just a false alarm. - Oh. - It's okay. It's okay. - What are you doing? Give him to me! Give him to me! - You think you can turn your back on us? Where's Tora? Where is she? - Duncan! - Dana, run! Run! - You disgust me! You're a traitor to your clan! - Come on. I've got you. - Ah! - If you're not one of us you can die like one of them! Ah! A-a-ah! - Dana... Come on. Alright, sweetheart. - Sweetie, I'm just gonna put you down for one second. There you go. Come on, Dana, get up! Come on, get up! - Put her down. Ah! You've got guts, Tora. You would've been a strong trow mother. - Don't you touch that baby. - It's the ninth day. The ritual must be performed. The only question is will it be done by me? Or you? - Nobody has to do this. - The first milk is done. The colostrum is gone. Her body is of no more use to the boy now than... Formula. - She's his mother. - No. - You are. It's what you've always wanted. It's what you've dreamed of. And here he is. And while other mothers only think their children are special, yours truly will be. All you have to do.. ...is slip the knife into her and you get to go home. You get to live your lives. - What do I have to do? - Kneel over her. You need to stab down hard and slice the rib cage in a sawing motion. Do it for your son. And give thanks for the life this glorious mother has given our newest son. So that our genetic supremacy may continue. - Ah! - Aah! You think you can kill me? I'm not man, I'm Kunal trow. And you... You could have been part of it. Instead, you'll be just like the rest of your... Miserable kind. Nothing! - Tora! Ah! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - D.I. Mckie. - Go ahead. - We've got another one. This one's wearing a necklace that says Zoe. - Joss Hawick's wife. How many's that? - Too many. - Can I ask you something? Did you know about all this? - I have daughters. - They were all somebody's daughter.
