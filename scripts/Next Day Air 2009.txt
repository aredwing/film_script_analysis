Why don't we just put the guns down? Man, I just deliver packages for a living. What the fuck am I doing here? What a day. Shut the fuck up! Brain, brain, go away Come to play another day Go away, go away 7500 Wissahickon Avenue. Apartment 303, Philadelphia. - Spell it. - You serious? Phila-del-phia, 19144. Apartment 303. You sure about that? Hell, yeah, I'm sure. I know where I live. - Be sure you're there to sign for it. - Don't worry. We'll be here. Rhino. Take that. We gotta a couple of hours to set that off. You sure you can trust that lady with this much work? Right now, I got no choice. After that loss I took from Carlos... Speaking of Carlos, I found him. He's in the car. Let me out! Fuck, man! - Look what the fuck he did to my face, man. - What the fuck? - You think I give a fuck about your face? - I don't have it. Let me tell you what happened. I wasn't feeling it. I got the money from Jess. I was ready to roll and I go to the airport, and just when I'm about to get on the plane the Feds snatched me up and took it. Look, I swear to God! I just didn't know how to tell you. 'Cause you're fucking crazy. I'm supposed to believe the Feds found $700,000 in your fucking suitcase? - I'm not lying! - That's what you want me to believe? I'm not lying, all right? Fuck. - Fuck, I'm not lying. - Do him a favor. No, Bodega. No! And in other news, following up on the story we left you yesterday, three masked gunmen apparently robbed the Prestige Bank on the corner of Broad and Olney. Early details were sketchy. However, police now believe that the would-be robbers who intended to set it off, really never set it off at all. Authorities say that all of the bank's funds are intact and the only thing stolen were the bank's surveillance tapes. - Shit. - Sandy Carter reporting live from Center City... Surveillance tapes? Idiots! Surveillance tapes? For real? Surveillance tapes, fuck! - It ain't my fault. - What? You're trying to say it's my fault? It ain't my fault. You had us go up in that bank in the first place. What? Bro, all I said was... You keep the car running. We might as well all just go in there. You know what I'm saying? It's the three of us. We're in and we're out. All right? What's up, man? Y'all looking at me like that. - You ready for the money? - Let's do it! - Okay then, let's go! - I need a gun, dawg! I need a gun. - Man, my fault, my fault, my fault. - Man. Yeah, you know what time it is. Get on the floor, now! Dawg, don't make it a homicide. Do what the fuck you're told. What you talking? It was perfect. Turn around. Hassie had the guard. I had the floor locked down. Everybody be quiet, don't say shit! Give me these glasses so I can see that paper. All you had to do was... Hit the safe. - Stop right there, Guch. - What? I could have sworn I heard you say... Yo. Get the tapes. Why would I toss you a trash bag and ask you to get the tapes? Why? You rise up in there like Billy the Kid, with the AK out. At least I'm thinking you're gonna hit the drawers. There better not be no pork in this either. Come on, come on, give me them tapes. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! You're trying to tell me the whole time you was in the vault you ain't see no money? - Brody, come on, man! - I've got it, Guch. I'm coming. My adrenalin was running. I don't remember. I probably didn't see no money. Guys, I got it. I got it. Let's go! Yeah, even with the boy's glasses on, you didn't see no money, right? That's 'cause you play too much. - Let's get out. - Come on. Open the door! Open the door! What the fuck, man? Fuck. My bad, yo, my bad. Come on, let's go! Yo, Brody! I should've gave it to that fat bastard. Man, if my shit was working right... What's wrong with your shit, Guch? I don't know, man. I think the pin's fucked up or something. It's like for some reason, you can pull the trigger one time... Come on, man. Stop pointing that gun at me. Come on, man. I ain't gonna shoot you with the motherfucking gun. I know what I'm doing. I'm saying, you pull this trigger one time, man, it'll shoot out every bullet in this clip. Yeah, you could cut that fat bastard down, for real. Yeah, I'll cut that fat bastard down, and 10 more motherfuckers standing behind him, man. Shit. We're in this bitch now, we ain't got no damn ride. - That shit was stolen anyway. - So what?

You know Allah, motherfucker? God damn! Where the fuck you at? Any other day, you see these motherfuckers all over the place. - Today, not one fucking truck. - Papi, calm down. I'm not used to seeing you bitch like this. You'd be bitching, too, if you knew what I know. Know what, Jess? What are you talking about? Okay. Remember Hector? Yeah, that dude you used to work for. What about him? That's right. One day he calls me up talking crazy, thanking me and shit. - Yo! - Phew! Thank you, Jesus. Yo, all the shit I gave you, go get it, bring it to the spot right now. Yo, dawg, half that stuff is on the street, man. No, I don't give a fuck where it's at. Go get it, bring it to the spot right now. Yo, what... I get there, and this big motherfucker answers the door. Hey, look. Your friend is here. - Is it all there? - No. Not even half. Your name is Jess? - Jesus. - Jesus. My name is Bodega Diablo. This is my associate, Rhino. I call him the Grim Reaper. And you start lying to me, you're gonna know why. You know, it's funny, just talking to your friend here for a little while, It seems like I've known you all my life. I know about your mother. I even know about your father. - Fuck. How? - God bless his soul. Now I... No. You need to be straight up with me right about now. A couple of days ago, I sent your friend here a package. After a long talk, he told me that he never got it. - He says you have it. - Me? Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Now where's my shit? I almost shit on myself. The last thing I wanted to do is to tell this man that I don't have his shit. Right, right. So what did you say? I didn't bite my tongue like no bitch. I told him the truth. Look, this motherfucker right here... I look him dead in the eyes and I said, "Look, I don't know what Hector told you, but I don't think my friend "had anything to do with your shit being stolen. "I've known this guy my whole life. "One thing I can bet my life on is that he ain't no thief. "Now whatever it takes, we'll get your money back. "Just let my friend go." Damn, baby, you said that shit? You fucking right I said that shit, and then check this out. He had the nerve to say... Shut up! Your boss, he's fired, okay? You now work for me. I'm standing there thinking, "I gotta be out of my goddamn mind... It's cool with me man. Whatever you say. "...if you think I'm gonna work for a piece of shit Mexican ass motherfucker like you." - Hell, no. - For what? So I can end up like this? You're fucking crazy. So I looked him dead in the eyes, and I said what any real motherfucker would have said. What did you say? Yes, sir. Shit, I ain't stupid, now. A Cali connect, exactly what I needed. And that's what I'm talking about. Yo, baby! Yo, that's him right there! - Ain't that him? - Shit! Oh, shit! That's gotta be him. That's gotta be him, yo. - Give me the shotgun. This motherfucker... - Here. Stay your ass in the car! You hear me? Stay in the car! Stay in the car! Where's my shit, motherfucker? Sir, do you have an account with NDA? Don't be playing with me.
