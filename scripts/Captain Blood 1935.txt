It's your friend, Lord Gildoy, wounded at Andrew Baynes' farm by the river. -The rash fool. -He sent me for you. No time to lose. Why, to be sure, I'll lose none, nor my head either. Come in and regain yours while I get my things. -I'll wait here. -As you please. Come, Mrs. Barlow, help me dress. Jeremy, how was the battle? Battle? Slaughter, rather! What can clubs do against cannon? In case this business keeps me overlong, take care you water my geraniums... especially those under the bedroom window. Geraniums. Won't you ever grow up? One would think you were still at medical school. Geraniums! You would think of geraniums... when every other able-bodied man is out fighting. It's out of favor I seem to be with you, my vinegary virgin. -Half the town is saying you're a papist. -Why? Because I have the sense to sleep tonight instead of rushing to my ruin... in an attempt to put this Duke of Monmouth on the throne? He'd be even worse than King James. Make haste with that cloak there, my pretty one. And the other half of the town that defends you... claims that you're just a coward. Mrs. Barlow, my darling, you can tell them, if you like... that I've been most anywhere that fighting was in evidence. Fought for the French against the Spanish, and the Spanish against the French... and I learned my seamanship in the Dutch Navy. But having had adventure enough in six years to last me six lives... I came here, hung up the sword, and picked up the lancet. Became a man of peace and not of war. A healer, not a slayer... and that I am going to be as long as I'm on top of the sod and not under it. -Will you be back for breakfast? -Who knows, my pretty one? The worst is done, my friend. Give your mind peace. The King's men! There's nothing to fear. This is a Christian country. Christian men don't make war on the wounded... or those who shelter them. I'm Capt. Hobart of Col. Kirke's dragoons. What rebels do you harbor? No rebels. This wounded gentleman-- No need to ask how he came by his wounds. A rebel. Out with him. This man can't be moved without peril to his life. Who the devil may you be? Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus. Don't fling your French at me. Latin, my dull friend. lt means I'm a doctor. Or a liar. lf your wit were as big as your voice, it's the great man you'd be for this. You may find me great enough to hang you! Yes, I don't doubt it. You've the looks and manners of a hangman. Take him away, and the others, too! ''ln the name of His Majesty, Our Sovereign Lord... ''prisoners of the Crown, you stand indicted... ''for having maliciously and traitorously conspired... ''to change, alter, and wholly to subvert the ancient government... ''of this Kingdom of England. ''Therefore, you are charged with high treason... ''against the most illustrious and most excellent... ''Prince James II by the grace of God... ''of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, King. ''Having no fear of God in your hearts... ''and being moved and seduced by the devil... ''you have failed in the love of due obedience toward the King... ''and have moved to disturb the tranquility of the nation... ''and to stir up war to depose said king from title... ''honor, and the regal name of the imperial crown. ''Therefore, you are here to be tried before His Majesty's Commissioner... ''the Lord Chief Justice, Baron Jeffreys of Wem... ''and by a jury of 12 good men and true.'' James Haynsworth, hold up your hand. -Guilty or not guilty? -Guilty. -Harold Carron, guilty or not guilty? -Guilty. -Andrew Baynes, guilty or not guilty? -Guilty. -Jeremy Pitt, guilty or not guilty? -Guilty. -John Wolverstone, guilty or not guilty? -Guilty. Uriah Ogle, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Praise the Lord. Henry Hagthorpe, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. -Lord Chester Dyke, guilty or not guilty? -Guilty. Peter Blood, guilty or not guilty? lt's entirely innocent, I am. Take the stand and face His Lordship. Are you guilty or not guilty? You must use the right words. Words, is it? Not guilty. And speaking of words, I'd like to say a few about the injustice... of keeping an innocent man locked up for three months... in such filth and heat and ill-feeding that my chief regret is I didn't try... to pull down the filthy fellow that sits on the throne. Silence! Are you entirely ignorant of the proper procedure of the court? Most happily ignorant up to now. I could gladly have done without this acquaintance. Enough of this. There is nothing more to be said, except the passing of sentence. May it please Your Lordship, but there's a deal more to be said! Silence! -How now, fellow? -There is the little matter of my defense. Very well, then... but in heaven's name, be brief, man. We have much to do. I am guilty of nothing, my lord... unless it be adjudged a crime that a man try to live peaceably. Living peaceably with the army of Monmouth? I was not with Monmouth's army, my lord. I was arrested while engaging in my profession as physician. What's this? You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue? And as such was summoned to the aid of Lord Gildoy... by Jeremy Pitt, who can so testify. Master Pitt will testify. He that is himself a confessed traitor. -ls that your witness? -There is also Andrew Baynes. Master Baynes will have enough testifying... in a useless effort to keep his own neck from the halter. I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater, the town where I live. We've no time for all this. lf these other traitors are as stubborn as you... I may sit here till the next assizes. Very well, then. There's a witness I'll give you that you can't deny: yourself, sir. For if I'm not physician, how is it I know that you're a dying man? The death to which you're dooming hundreds of poor men daily... in a frantic effort to send their souls to perdition before your own... is a light pleasantry... compared to the bleeding death in the lungs... to which the great Judge has condemned you. Now, fellow, we'll be done with the witnesses... and I will convict you out of your own rascally mouth. When this Pitt came to summon you, as you claim... did you know you were called to attend another rebel? My business was with his wounds, not his politics. Did you know the law... that any person who does knowingly receive, harbor, comfort... or succor a rebel is as guilty as if he himself bore arms? I only knew my sacred duty as a physician. Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king! I thought it was to my fellow man. lt's a fearful thing to send a man's soul to perdition... but I am bound by my conscience... and my love of my king to deal out justice. Therefore, I instruct you, gentlemen of the jury... that inasmuch as Peter Blood has admitted... aiding a traitor to your king... you do bring in a verdict of guilty... that he may be hanged... for the high treason he has committed. What a creature must sit on the throne... who lets a man like you deal out his justice. -Your Majesty. -Sunderland, what brings you here? These numerous hangings. Splendid, aren't they? We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion. Very true, Your Majesty... but a foolish waste of valuable human flesh. How so? Your Majesty's colonies in the West Indies are urgently in need of slaves. A healthy, vigorous man can be reckoned worth from 10 to 20. Splendid, Sunderland. Send out word immediately that the King is graciously pleased to command... that all rebels convicted but not yet hanged... be gathered together... and shipped by the first available boats to the Americas. Give us water! There are men dying down here. You'd think they'd take better care of a valuable cargo like us. Ahoy, the deck! Land sighted, Port Royal! lt's a truly royal clemency we're granted, my friends... one well worthy of King James. He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman's rope... and gives the slow death of slavery. He grants us our lives in exchange for a living death. lt's an uncertain world entirely. ''Be it known, men, that these prisoners who stand before you... ''are now to be sold at a right and fitting price. ''They may be put to labor in the sulfur mines... ''or on the plantations for a period of 10 years. ''And the parties to whom they are assigned... ''must enter into security for the proper punishment... ''of their offense.'' His Excellency, the Governor of Port Royal. Guards, attention! Present muskets. Good day, Captain. Lovely day, isn't it? Or is it? -Good day, Dixon. -Good day, Governor. I suppose we can begin this sale now, Governor. No, better wait for Col. Bishop. He has the privilege of being late for everything. Yes, I know. There he is. -Good afternoon, Col. Bishop. -Good afternoon, Governor. Good afternoon, Miss Arabella. How is my darling, the Governor, and his foot? Every day I think my gout can't get any worse... and every day it does. My dear Colonel, according to the King's request... it is for you to take first choice of this dainty nosegay... and at your own price. Egad, they're an appalling lot... not likely to be of much value on the plantation. The less you want, the more for Dixon. -Dixon? Uncle, I wish you'd buy them all. -Buy them all? To keep them out of Dixon's hands. I perceive somebody's been talking behind my back... telling the truth. -And you can joke. -Arabella dear, don't be childish. These men are rebels against their king. They should be hanged, drawn, and quartered. -Any fate they meet is too good for them. -Your uncle is right. -Let the sale commence. -My foot! My dear, the law is the law, and it's His Majesty's law... and must be obeyed. The best of the lot. Open your mouth. -20. -Sold! Sold to Col. Bishop for 20. -As if he were buying horses. -Yes, quite. -Same price. -This is Jeremy Pitt, ship's pilot... young and sturdy. -Same price. -Sold! Sold to Col. Bishop for 20. Quiet! Open your mouth. His pride has bought him a ticket to Dixon's mines. He isn't there yet. -My dear, consider your social position! -Uncle! -Which one? -That one. -Him? I will not. -But I want you to. No. Let him cool his head in Dixon's mines. I'll have none of him. -5. -5? That's an insulting sum to offer. -Does anyone offer more? -6. 7. You're making an exhibition of yourself... a girl like you, bidding for a slave before these people. -Will you buy him? -Certainly not. 8. When a lady's interested in a man.... Calm down, Dixon, 8 is nothing for such a man... a skilled physician, a gentleman, and a scholar. -All right, 9. -10! lt's apparent Miss Bishop wants him more than I do. Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for 10. Sold! 10, sold. What would you like done with him, Miss Bishop? Why, I don't know. You're extremely foolish. lt might have cost you your life. lt was fortunate for you that I was here to save you. I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought by anyone by the name of Bishop. You could learn a lesson in gratitude. I could thank for not interfering. As it happens, you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it. You may join the others belonging to my uncle... and henceforth you may take your orders from him. Your very humble slave, Miss Bishop. Come on. Move on, there. Last night, this dog attempted to escape. Today you'll see what happens to those who forget... that my friend King James did you all a favor... in saving you from your just fate on the gallows. Show them the iron, Kent. F-T. Whoever wears that brand is known as a fugitive traitor... and will be treated as such. Burn those letters in your brain... lest they be burned on your hides, too. There speaks a fit friend for King James if ever I heard one. Would I had him and his friend James roasting on a spit over that fire. Great would be the burning thereof and loud the rejoicing in Heaven. Do your duty! What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so. -This beastly gout! -Perhaps a new dressing will help. Perhaps. -I have it here. -Put it down. So sorry, Doctor. Easy, you clumsy louts! -We won't hurt you, Governor. -You thick-fingered jackasses! His Excellency will have his little joke. lll-begotten bunglers! -Blundering pill peddlers! -Your Excellency-- That is the final straw. Out of this house... and never let me see your faces again. -But think of our reputations. -Hang your reputations! Leave me! I don't want to see you again! Away! Out! I don't want to see you! Out into the streets! Stop shouting. You brought on my headache again. Good! Hannibal, come take my crutch. Easy, now. Help me up with my foot. No remedy. Why, thank you, dear. Why doesn't His Excellency try another doctor? Another doctor? There are only those two on this wretched island... -and each one is worse than his partner. -There is another. And according to what I've heard, he became a slave by being a doctor. A slave? Would you elevate a slave to the position of doctor to the Governor? -ls he a good doctor? -I don't know. Why are you laughing? I'm just thinking how annoyed Peter Blood would be... if I did him another favor. Your Excellency, there are diverse citizens of this sovereign island... who come before you with complaints. Complaints, complaints. Can none of my citizens follow the example of their governor... who endures the utmost agony without a murmur? -Easy there, fellow. -Did I hurt you, sir? No, but I thought you were going to. Your Excellency, this vagrant hides his sins... behind the name of Honesty Nuttall. -He's charged with being in debt. -State your case, fellow, and no lies. I was on the way to pay the butcher on Tuesday... as Honesty Nuttall is my name, when I chanced on a poor old beggar. lt was Jones from the grog shop... who begged me to have a drink with him. Try standing on it, Your Honor. Stand on that bundle of pain? Impossible. I remembered in time my poor starving wife in need of the five bob. What is this all about? Silence! -Sit down. -What's he here for? For debt, Your Excellency, and the prevaricator-- lf it's for debt, don't annoy me with such petty things. Order him to work it off. Work? Not that, anything but work. What's your trade? I'm a ship's carpenter when the painful necessity arises. Take him to work on the docks... and don't you attempt to escape till every farthing's paid... or I'll stretch your hide on the rack! Escape? How could a debtor escape from this island... even if he had a boat to do it with? I couldn't escape any more than a slave could escape. I can walk. Wonderful, my dear fellow. Only two months' treatment, and I'm a well man. lt's a miracle. -The next complaint-- -Drat the next complaint. I can walk. Come, Doctor. You'll get your reward for this, Peter Blood. -From now on, you're my physician. -Your Excellency is too kind. Come back early tomorrow. You're always welcome, Dr. Blood. Hello. Don't I know you? A lady should know her own property. -My property? -Let me refresh your memory. My name is Peter Blood, and I'm worth precisely 10. Forgive me for not recognizing you, Dr. Blood. You're so changed... for the better. The Governor tells me I have you to thank for that. You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood. Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life when my friends are treated like animals? lt's they deserve your favors, not I. They're all honest rebels. I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free England... from an unclean tyrant. I believe you're talking treason. I hope I'm not obscure. -You could be flogged for that. -No. The Governor would never allow it. He has the gout. You depend upon that? I intend to, for all it's worth, and that promises to be considerable. But you'd hardly know about that. You've probably never had the gout. -Good afternoon, Miss Bishop. -Good afternoon. 15-2, 15-4, and a pair are six. -Another? -What else is there to do... ever since you ruined the Governor's foot and our reputations with it? -I ruined the Governor's foot? -I tell you, Doctor, you're methods are-- -Someone coming. -A patient? A patient! -I beg your pardon, Doctor. I'm so sorry. -lt's all right. Come in. Good afternoon, colleagues. Dr. Bronson. -Dr. Whacker. -Good afternoon. How's business, my friends? -Terrible. -Good. -Terribly good. -That relieves me. I had heard that things were not altogether.... ldle gossip, obviously. You intend to remain here? Remain here? Why not? lt's queer. There are you, free to come and go as you please, and you choose to stay here. While I, who hate this pestilential island.... Such are the quirks of circumstance. I must be running along, gentlemen. Good day, gentlemen. lt's pleasant to see everything so prosperous with you here. -Not so hasty. -Just a moment. There's something I'd like to ask you. Well, gentlemen? Have you been thinking of leaving us, Doctor? Leaving? Now, Doctor. How could a slave think of leaving? Or even if he were fool enough to try, by what means could he hope to escape? And where, for example, could he raise the few pounds necessary... to purchase even a small boat? -We might supply it. -You? -Now, gentlemen. -Now, let's talk this thing over. Now, if you'll just sit down here. Now then, how much will you need? 20 might buy a small wherry, 10 more might equip it. He's right. -He means-- -You needn't tell me what he means. I know two Christian gentlemen when I see them. Two men whose hearts are bleeding for a brother doctor in distress. But it's too much to ask, too noble a gesture to hope for. No, my good man, not at all. But who would buy the boat? We would not dare, and you, a slave, you could not. True. That would be my part. To find someone. A man as eager to escape as I. -A man held here for debt, say. -Then it's a bargain? Gentlemen, you've opened for me the gates of hope. Doctor. -My dear colleague. -Gentlemen. Now we have him. We've only to get him involved and reveal his plan. He'll steal very little of our business when he's in irons. Gentlemen. There's one thing slipped my mind entirely. Simple-minded men might think this an opportunity for trickery... but brilliant men like yourselves will remember in what favor I stand... with the Governor in contrast to some others... and how little their words would weigh against mine. Heigh-ho for the Governor's foot! Good day, gentlemen. -Are you all with me? -Yes. Listen. There's a man named Nuttall who's in trouble with the Governor. He's looking for a small boat which he'll purchase... on the night chosen for our escape. -Escape? -Quiet! While he gathers stores and equipment, we must be ready on the inside. We might steal some sugarcane knives and hack through the stockade walls. Or dig our way under. Once at sea, if we get there, our troubles will have just begun. lf any of you want to withdraw, now's the time. -No. -Not me. You'll be a lubber crew, but I'll match your hearts against any other. We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt. He was a ship's pilot. Here's one you won't have to teach. Six years in King James' Navy. -What? -That's nothing. I was a blooming gunner. -A gunner? -ln the King's Navy, too. I was always ashamed of it up to now. We'll have a crew yet! Any of you others been keeping such secrets? Where's Baynes? -Where is he? -He tried to escape today. No! Caught? -Branded? -Yeah. No! Why did you do it, Andy? I told you I'd try to get you out. I couldn't stand it any longer. I couldn't stand it. I was going mad. What do you think a man is made of? How much do you think he can stand? ''Watchman, what of the night?'' lsaiah 21 :1 1 . Don't make the purchase until well on in the evening. That way there'll be less risk... of anyone wondering where you came by the money. Lumme, Captain. lt ain't too late for us to change our minds. Stow the provisions away on board as soon as it's dark. Then all you've got to do is sit down here and wait for us. ls that all? Wait all alone in the blooming dark... waiting for someone to come along and nab me. Nuttall, my lad, there's just one other little thing. Could you find me a good piece of timber about so thick and so long? Yes, I think so. Then do so and lash it to your spine. lt needs stiffening. Courage. I'll join you at midnight. How long does it take to feed this pack of dogs? lt's a wonder we make a profit at all. You don't drive them hard enough. Get them out of here! I've just been with Nuttall at the boat. lt's tonight. -At last! -For heaven's sake, command yourself. -Tonight, Hagthorpe. -Caution above everything. He who goes slowly, goes safely. Remember, Jeremy, you're the only navigator among us. Without you, there's no escape. Hello, Uncle! Riding again? What do you plan to see riding always the same road? You'd be surprised what interesting things there are to see on this island... if you only keep your eyes open. Today, for instance, I saw something that you'd give 1,000 ducats to know. Stores and equipment are all stowed away onboard. We could use more food, but there's no money left. I'm not taking any chances by asking our medical friends for more. I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat by midnight. Jeremy, we must not fail tonight. What the devil have you been up to? Tonight will be a fine night, judging by the sky. There you are, Pitt. Keep it covered up and it should heal in a day or so. Miss Bishop. You looking for me, sir? Yes. You, stop! What's the matter? Why are you shaking? Nothing. l.... What's going on between you two? Why, nothing. The man has a bad leg. I'll tend to you later. Where have you been? I've been at my work, attending to the Governor. You lie. Do I? The Governor's had another attack of gout. He's been screaming for you like a wounded horse all the afternoon. Then it appears I was not with the Governor. Then where have you been? -Why, I've been at.... -He was with me, Uncle. What? Thank you for protecting my reputation, Dr. Blood, but it was a useless gallantry. My uncle knows that I spend my time with whomever I please. You might choose your company with better taste. His Excellency's waiting for you! Here, Kent, lend him your horse. Yes, sir. Otherwise, the lout will be all night getting there. Will I be required there long, sir? You're afraid your work will interfere with your social affairs? lf I get back late, before midnight, could I get back into the stockade? Will you stay here talking all night? Be off with you! Take him to the stockade! Go on, get along in there. lf he talks, we're lost. Well? lt seems that you're continually doing me favors. -I don't know why. -Neither do I. Yes, I do. lt's because you're so very grateful and always thank me so prettily. Sure now, you don't blame me for resenting you and your favors. This is interesting. I've had men tell me they had reasons for admiring me... and some have even laid claims to reasons for loving me... but for a man to store up reasons for resenting me, how refreshing. You must tell me a few of them. The first is reason enough. You bought me. I've had no lack of experiences in my time, but to be bought and sold was a new one. I was in no mood to thank my purchaser. That I can understand. Go on. I've resented you because your name is Bishop. My thoughts have lumped you with your uncle. How was I to know that a devil could have.... That a devil could have an angel for a niece? From a resentful man, that is a pretty fair compliment. Have you any more reasons for resenting me like that one? lndeed, I have. And the strongest of all... I've resented you because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave. Do you understand that? I don't know. Perhaps if you were to explain further, I.... I've already talked too much. I'll open your mouth! You'll stay here without food or water until you talk. -Why did you lie to your uncle? -Because.... Dr. Blood, you're a physician and should know. ls it not considered unhealthy for a slave to be seen at a boat? -Why should it be? -Boats put out to sea. Slaves may not. You're jumping to conclusions, aren't you? Am I? The Governor will be waiting for you. Yes. Miss Bishop, it's difficult for an Irishman to apologize. But I hope you can forgive me for having thought badly of you. I will, if you tell me how you think of me now. How I think of you now? I think of you.... I think of you as the woman who owns me. Her slave. But I think the man is lucky who can count you his friend. I think you know you can. Your slave is grateful for all marks of favor. When you forget your slavery and go so far-- Now there, you're mistaken. However far this slave may go, he won't forget. lt's a characteristic we Irish have in common with the elephants. Hello. Where are you going? You're so much improved, I was returning to the stockade. Don't leave me tonight. I'm a sick man. I assure you, sir, there's nothing more I can do. There must be something. Perhaps you ought to bleed me again. Very well, then, if you wish it. But mind, no more softness about this. I'm gonna have you well by midnight if I have to bleed you to death. -Who goes there? -Peter Blood. -Jeremy, what's happened? -Water. Easy, lad. I didn't tell him. I didn't. -Tell him what, Jeremy? -About our plans. My back. Help me. -Who did this? -Bishop. Bishop. Swine! I didn't tell him. I didn't. -ls our boat still standing in at the bay? -Yes, Jeremy. I wondered if I was still out of my mind. I've been seeing boats sailing in and out... in and out, but ours will never sail. Not now. Or if it does, you'll sail without me. What? And get lost at sea without our navigator? -Nonsense, lad. -We are not going this time. lt's hopeless for all of us. We'll manage somehow. -What are you doing here? -Doing? Why, the duties of my office. I said he was to have no food nor drink till I ordered. Sure now, I never heard you. How could you? You weren't here. Then how do you expect me to know what orders you've given? ln the name of humanity! lf you know the word. -You dare take that tone with me? -Yes, I do! I've been too soft with you... but that shall be mended. Kent, tie him up! Had it easy here up to now. Get up there. Now I'll take this rod to you... until there's not an inch of hide left on your dirty carcass. Another beating? This will be a good half-dozen of them you've given me in promise. This will be as real as it is overdue. And what becomes of His Excellency the Governor's gouty foot? You'll not save yourself with that device this time. Nothing will save you. Pirates! Spanish pirates! This is what I call a timely interruption. Though what will come of it, the devil himself only knows. We've got to get through the town to get to the boat. Wait here, lads. lt's me. Mr. Nuttall. You came close to being the ex-Mr. Nuttall. Wouldn't be the first death I died today. We can't stay here waiting for them to catch sight of us. Let's get to the boat down this way. Sunk to the bottom of the briny. And it sunk our hopes with it. -Perhaps not. -What do you mean, Peter? -He's gonna take a bath? -Yes, but not for cleanliness. Since the Spaniards have been thoughtless enough to sink our craft... I'll see if I can't persuade them to lend us one of theirs. Your Excellency, facts are so often dull and deplorable. Nevertheless, at the risk of boring you... it is my painful duty to inform you that 250 of my men... are now complete masters of the town of Port Royal. Your most worthy islanders have been disarmed... and your city is now absolutely in the hands... of the forces of His Majesty King Philip of Spain. Now that you have our city, what do you want with it? For a price, I could forebear reducing it to ashes. -What price? -200,000 pieces of eight. 200,000 pieces of eight? That's why we waited till this morning to put to sea. We've a message for those Spaniards. They are on their way now to receive it. -Hagthorpe, man the guns! -Clear deck! -All ready, Hagthorpe? -Aye, Peter, ready. Give them a taste of their own iron! You've done it, Hagthorpe! Hurrah! Didn't I tell you I was a gunner, sir? You did that, you son of a Yorkshire steer... and bless your rusty heart, it's a gunner you are! lt's the Governor. lt must be that some brave party of citizens captured the ship. I think you're right. Someone should go aboard and congratulate them. Yes. My foot. Since your gout so unhappily prevents you, allow me to be the one. Go ahead. You've always wanted to be governor anyway. Don't be nervous. -Man those sweeps. -Aye, sir. -Shall we hoist anchor, Peter? -Aye. Get under way. There's another boat approaching. lt looks like Col. Bishop. -Who? -Bishop. The fool would come blundering in just now. -I'll make short work of him. -No, Hagthorpe, none of that. But.... Who.... Welcome aboard the Cinco Lagos, Colonel darling. You? Was it.... Peter Blood, was it you, then, who took this ship and turned defeat into victory? Myself it was. Myself and these, my friends. And your friends. And you saved my money, too! -Yes, it was heroic. -Heroic, is it? lt was epic. You amaze me. On my soul, you deserve well. You all deserve well. -You shall find me grateful. -How grateful? I shall ask His Excellency to write home to the King an account of your exploit. Perhaps some of your sentencing shall be remitted. That's just about what we expected from you. Now, Wolf, Col. Bishop has a kind heart. -But what kind, I'd hate to say. -What is this? Why, Colonel darling, such unusual generosity from you... must be making you feel unwell. -As your physician, I'd prescribe-- -A bit of neck-stretching. Lads, we shouldn't hang this man. -No? -No. Tie him over the end of a gun! I'll scatter his innards all over the sugarcane field. You're wasting words, I say. Hang him ! Wait, lads. Hanging's too dignified for him. Can you swim, Colonel darling? We're giving you the chance to cool off some of that excessive heat of yours. Over the side with him, men! One, two... three! Peter Blood, I'll make you pay for this... if I spend the rest of my life doing it! And then the whale came, and the whale swallowed Jonah. I hope. Goodbye, Jonah. Don't forget to write. What's the next move, Peter? Up anchor! Wolf, man the capstan bar. Hagthorpe, get the sails aloft. Thomas, get those men over here. Round you go, men! That's no water wheel you're working. -Can you handle it, Jeremy? -Aye, aye, Peter. We sail. Hard to starboard. Up that rigging, you monkeys, aloft! There's no chains to hold you now! Break out those sails... and watch them fill with the wind that's carrying us all to freedom. We, the undersigned... are men without a country... outlaws in our own land, and homeless outcasts in any other. Desperate men, we go to seek a desperate fortune. Therefore, we do here and now band ourselves... into a brotherhood of buccaneers... to practice the trade of piracy on the high seas. We, the hunted, will now hunt! To that end, we enter into the following articles of agreement. First... we pledge ourselves to be bound together as brothers... in a life-and-death friendship... sharing alike in fortune and in trouble. Second article. All moneys and valuables which may come into our possession... shall be lumped together into a common fund... and from this fund shall first be taken the money... to fit, rig, and provision the ship. After that, the recompense each will receive who is wounded as follows: For the loss of a right arm, 600 pieces of eight. Left arm, 500. For the loss of a right leg, 500. Left leg, 400. A fellow can get rich if he's lucky. Greedy. lf a man conceal any treasure captured... or fail to place it in the general fund, he shall be marooned. Set ashore on a deserted isle... and there left with a bottle of water, a loaf of bread... and a pistol with one load. lf a man shall be drunk on duty, he shall receive the same fate. And if a man shall molest a woman captive against her will... he, too, shall receive the same punishment. These articles entered into, this 20th day of June, in the year 1687. Now, men, you've heard the agreement. lt's the world against us and us against the world. ''His hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him.'' Genesis 16:12. Those of you in favor of these articles, raise your right hands and say aye! Aye! Blood! This impertinent, ungoverned rascal must be eradicated. Yes, Your Majesty. Sinking Spanish ships causes me enough embarrassment... -but he sinks English ships as well. -Yes, Your Majesty. Cannot Gov. Steed do something about it? He does his best, but conditions on the island-- Silence, Willoughby! I'm not interested in anything you have to say. I know your feelings towards me. Sunderland, what are you Secretary of State for? Have you no solution? -Yes, Your Majesty. -Get your head off that hinge. Speak up. Since Gov. Steed is incapable, you should appoint a stronger man. Who? Col. Bishop assures me that if he were in power... he would not rest day or night... until this Capt. Blood was swinging on execution dock. Angling for the office, is he? What difference if he's the iron man we need? Draw up the appointment. I've already taken the liberty of doing so, Your Majesty. Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed, I wish you both a pleasant journey. I thank you, Governor. Again, congratulations, Gov. Bishop. -May your term of office be successful. -Thank you, my friend. Arabella dear, have a nice holiday in England. I'm sure I shall. -Captain. -Yes, sir. -Keep a weather eye open for pirates. -Very well, sir. Before you return, Arabella, I shall have the sea swept clean of them. Particularly one. I think you know whom I mean. I hope he gets the gout the infernal office gave me. Come along. Goodbye. Thomas Fulton. One share, no injuries. James Graham. One share, plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound. Zachary Stevens. For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo... one share, plus 10 of silver. Oliver Clark. One share, plus 400 pieces of eight for the loss of his left leg. There you are, Oliver, I'm proud of you. Lord Chester Dyke. No injury, one share and 5 of silver. Anton Brazilimo. Andrew Fell. One share, plus 500 pieces of eight for the loss of his left arm. There you are, Andrew, and good luck. David Sampson. One share, no injuries. Honesty Nuttall. No injuries, one share. Hold on, Captain. How about me little toe, heroically sacrificed in battle? Honesty Nuttall. One share, and nothing for the toe he just shot off himself. You stupid numskull. You should have shot out your brains and left your toe for thinking with. Ahoy, the deck! An English ship on the port bow! So it is. A fine big ship, too, as far as I can judge from this distance. Shall we sail over and give them a surprise? No, Peter. The men are set on putting in at Tortuga. Their gold's burning holes in their pockets. What's one ship more or less to us now? lt appears I have a mutiny on my hands. What ho, the deck! A ship to starboard! lt may be a pirate! Very well, then. Sail on, little ship, back to England... where we may never go. You'll never know how close you came to not getting there. Your turn, mon capitaine. Up! It's your turn now. Again, my captain. -Are you ready? -Right. It's good. This time, my friend, huh? -You missed. -No. I am defeated. You win the prize, Capt. Blood. -Goodbye, my dear. -Goodbye. What a charming captain. Some other time, perhaps. Why? What sort of a man are you? I'm the sort of man you like, my dear. A man with money. The money! Mon capitaine, what a pair we would make. ln all the Caribbean, there is no buccaneer so strong as me. Except you. You almost flatter me, Levasseur. Why do you hold off your consent so long? We become partners. You've been in Tortuga these three, four months. You must be even so much in need of gold as I. Such a partnership requires sober thought. My poor head has been dancing with rum this whole week past. Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest this side the Caribbean. With your brain and my strength, there is nothing we cannot do. There's very little I can't do all by myself. Long Iive Capt. Levasseur! And here's to Capt. Blood! Hurrah! Then, it's a good dinner guest, my friend. -You're next, Peter. -Mon capitaine. lt's clearly understood, then, that we sail under my articles. Those very severe articles of yours? Mais oui, I sail under the articles of a girls' sminaire... to have you as my partner, mon capitaine. Women will be the death of you yet, Levasseur. lt is a very pleasant way to die, even if it is expensive. What is the first order, mon capitaine partner? We sail on the tide. Outside the harbor, we'll scatter. Each ship will proceed singly to pick up any stray ships we'll find on the journey. We'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra. Magnifique! I give you the toast. To our great success! Let me give one. To the greatest captain on the Caribbean! -Oui! To Capitaine Levasseur! -Capt. Blood. Bravo! The articles aside, let's give a toast to Capt. Blood. Capitaine Levasseur. To the greatest captain on the coast. The greatest captain on the coast, is it? Methinks the greatest captain on the coast... has just made the greatest mistake... the most ordinary common fool could make. lt's been so lovely. I'd like to stay forever. You've all been so kind. Come again and visit us soon, dear. England is so much more beautiful when you're here. -Thank you. Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Thank you for everything. -Goodbye, dear. -Goodbye, Amelia. -Goodbye, Mary. However else the court may have changed, the art of flattery still flourishes. Stab me if it's flattery. When the King ordered me on this journey as a special emissary to the West Indies... I looked forward with some trepidation to a life among the savages. But when I found you were one of those savages... returning to your native heath, my grateful eyes could hardly believe it. You pictured us running around in animal skins, eating raw meat? Why not, in a country filled with Indians and pirates? Speaking of pirates, did you ever happen to hear of a wild rogue named Blood? -Peter Blood? -Yes. No. I don't know him. I hardly number pirates among my acquaintances. Of course not. Stupid of me. I merely mention him in passing. Because he's one of the objects of my mission. -Your mission? -Yes. I've been sent to try to blot out all this piracy, my dear. And in a manner I must keep secret till I find Capt. Blood. Ship on the port side, sir! Yes, that's a fine ship. -Captain, what ship is that? -I don't know, Lord Willoughby. She flies the French flag. She could be anything in these waters. -We're in pirate waters now, aren't we? -Yes, we are. Yonder bank of low clouds is the island of Virgen Magra. -Exciting, isn't it? -Very. Could she be a pirate ship, by any chance? Any ship we meet in the Caribbean could be a pirate ship. Ahoy, English ship off port side! Prepare to come onto starboard tack! Starboard tack it is! Steady at the helm ! Ready? Stand by your guns. What Iuck. Just as I'm about to give up and anchor to wait for my partner, Capt. Blood... this fine English prize walks into my parlor and says: ''HeIIo, Capt. Levasseur. '' -We've got to give welcome, Cahusac. -Yes, and how. Light it! The ransom for you two is fixed at 20,000 pieces of eight. I shall provide a boat for you... to go to Gov. Bishop at Jamaica to collect it. Meanwhile, mademoiseIIe remains with me as hostage. I find it very lonely on this island. I refuse absolutely and utterly! You know this? It is the rosary of pain. lt is possible to screw a man's eyes out of his head. Very well. Do your worst. AIors! No, stop! Lord Willoughby, thank you, but don't be foolish. MademoiseIIe is right. Thank you, miss. I beg you to spare yourself and the young lady. You know, I've been too modest with you... but since I have said 20,000 pieces of eight... eh bien, I have said 20,000 pieces of eight. For what, if you please, have you said 20,000 pieces of eight? lf it ain't the niece of our old friend Col. Bishop. You don't recognize her. Mind that. What does he mean? Your guess is as good as mine. -Good morning, Levasseur. -HeIIo, Captain. -Cahusac. -Capitaine. I arrived late last night and put into a cove a few miles to the west. We've walked across to give you good morning, but, faith... it seems we've interrupted some business of yours. -Who are these people? -Oh, yes, here. As you see, two prisoners. I captured an English ship. Yes. We saw her coming across the spit. I must congratulate you, Levasseur. I didn't so much as sight a sail. The fortunes of war, my partner. And these are also the fortunes of war? Big fortunes. A nobleman and the niece of the Governor of Jamaica. Really? I suppose congratulations are again in order... but have you forgotten there's an article in our agreement... forbidding the taking of women prisoners? That's a foolish article of yours. I was not aware you regarded it so when we signed. Would you care to dispute my opinion now, your men against mine? Not this morning, thank you. As you say, a foolish article. Heard, my friend. That is why these are prisoners of my own, a matter personal. -And the 20,000 pieces of eight? -Their ransom. -That is also a personal matter? -lt is. Obviously, these two prisoners, and particularly the young lady... must be kept in someone's hands for, shall we say, safekeeping... but why your hands? Why shouldn't Pierre have her, or Roch, or Jacob... since she's as much their property as yours? Or doesn't that please you? You'd like to keep her for yourself. And who might that be, do you suppose? -That is your Capt. Blood. -Capt. Blood? Now, my captain... since you covet our joint property of war, you may have her... providing you're willing to buy her. -Buy her? -At the price you yourself have put on her. 20,000 pieces of eight. The ransom is to be paid by Gov. Bishop. lt is for division when it comes. But if the Governor should refuse to pay the ransom, what then? No. If you're to keep the girl meanwhile, pay the ransom. Let it be your risk to collect it from the Governor. Capt. Blood is right. -lt's in the articles. -What's in the articles, you fools? Where do you suppose I have 20,000 pieces of eight? -Let someone buy her who has. -Who? -l. -You? Jeremy, Wolf, bring the prisoners forward. Here they are, Peter. I bid 20,000 pieces of eight. Can you improve on that, Levasseur? I don't wish to be bought by you. As a lady once said to a slave... you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it. -You want the girl? -Why not? And I'm willing to pay for what I want. Cahusac, you boast a knowledge of pearls. At what do you value each of those? 1,000 pieces each. They're worth rather more, but very well. Here are 12. The three-fifths the value of the prize due your ship for having made the capture. For the share due my men, I make myself responsible. Now, Wolf, will you be so kind as to take my property aboard ship? And that settles that, my captain partner. -No, you don't! -Stop, Capitaine! Wait! You'll not take her while I live! Then I'll take her when you're dead! -Capitaine, it has been honorably settled. -lt has not been settled for me! What is a girl, more or less? Do not be a fool, Capitaine! It's my business. Two breaches in our articles committed by you. You should be marooned. lt's what I intended for you in the end... but since you prefer it this way, you muckrake, I'll be humoring you. Up! And that, my friend, ends a partnership that should never have begun. All these things I've gathered in my journeys. I've gone far since I was a slave on your uncle's plantation... thousands of restless, hectic miles. But somehow tonight, I've got a strange feeling... that my journey's almost over. You see these ankle rings? They came from a ship that was out from Persia. And these pearls... they're the choice from a fleet we captured off the Azores. -Have you ever seen such pearls? -Yes, I have. They're like the pearls you sometimes use for making purchases, are they not? -Yes, they are. -How many lives did they cost? As few as possible. lt wasn't lives I was after. -What, then? -I never quite knew. Some urge that drove me on. Revenge, I suppose. But I've had my fill of revenge. I often wondered why I bothered to save all these things. Tonight I know it's because... one day you'd be here in this cabin to wear them. I'll never wear them, never! Those nor any other plunder gotten by a thief and pirate. Thief and pirate. I've seen your pirate ways. I've seen myself bargained for and fought over. A combat between jackals. But I thought you understood. You mean you thought you'd bought me. I suppose I should have regarded that as a compliment. You pirates are used to taking without the formality of purchase. I advise you to go back to your ladies at Tortuga... who are thrilled by your bold, lawless ways. I only hate you and despise you. I might have expected your thanks for what I've done this day... but very well, let it be so. I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you how a thief and a pirate can deal. Once, you bought me for a miserable 10. Now I've bought you for considerably more. The amount's of no matter. What matters is now I own you as you once owned me. You're mine, do you understand? Mine to do with as I please! Capt. Blood, Lord Willoughby sends his compliments... and requests you to talk with him at your convenience. He's been sent by the King himself. Tell him I'm not convenient to any friend of the King's. All I've got to say is good riddance... as soon as I can get him to his destination. I shall. Jeremy. Wolverstone. -Wolverstone! -What is it, Peter? We're changing course. Draw down every rag of canvas the yards will hold. -Aye, aye, Peter, but.... -Jeremy! All hands on deck! -Jeremy! -Coming, Peter! Forever sleeping when I need you? -I wasn't sleeping. I was-- -Never mind! Get ready to go about. -Set the course for Port Royal. -Port Royal? But the English fleet is at Port Royal. Col. Bishop-- Sweet, merciful heaven! Haven't you ears? Set the course for Port Royal! -Make speed there, Wolverstone. -Speed it is, Peter. -Follow we a helm, west by north. -West by north, sir. Make speed there! To your halyards! Tacks and braces. We head for Port Royal. Make speed there! That's the order! Make speed there. There's a gallows waiting for each of us at Port Royal... and no man should be late to his own hanging. How you hate the villain. lf I were a young man, I'm dashed if I wouldn't be jealous. But you said you didn't even know him. He was once my slave. Slave? Did you know him well? I did. He's not such a bad fellow for a pirate. When he made his escape, I was thrilled and happy. That was before I knew how he would use his freedom. But aren't you forgetting... that a man's bitter heart may demand revenge? That is the unforgivable thing: to have put his revenge above everything else... and to have destroyed himself. That's what he's done. I've seen pirates. I know their ways. Cruel, evil, greedy, plundering peaceful cities... torturing their captives. Beasts. Are you so much in love with him? ln love with him? That you care so much what he does? I don't care in the least what he does. Someone should, in view of what he's doing now. But your uncle's with the fleet at Port Royal. That much is fortunate. Why? What's this about my uncle in Port Royal? He amazes me, this fellow. That's where he means to take us. -No, he can't. -They won't let me near him. He's alone on his quarterdeck in a fine Irish temper, I suspect. -But I learned of it from one of the crew. -Lord Willoughby, he mustn't. My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man. He lives in the hope of one day taking and hanging Capt. Blood. Capt. Blood probably doesn't know that, of course. I doubt if it'd make any difference if he did. He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy. Chivalrous? And yet he's been what he's been these last three years... and done what he's done. Lord Willoughby, help me. I see your point, my child... but that's something you must decide for yourself. Life can be infernally complex. lt's hard to lay tongue to the right words. I'll lay tongue to them. We won't sail to Jamaica. Them's the words. Aye, Bishop's entire fleet's at Jamaica. When you risked your neck in a duel over that petticoat... that was your business. But it's our necks you're risking now, and I say no. Not for her, nor a dozen like her. I got a great affection for my neck. I have no wish to hear it cracked by a hangman's knot. This is what comes from sailing the seas with a lovesick madman. We've been with you since the first, Peter. We have a right. You, too, Jeremy? All right, lads. What do you mean, Peter? You told me we're not sailing to Jamaica. There's nothing more to be said. -Hurrah for our side! -Quiet. You sound like a rooster. Good night, lads. Wait a minute, Peter. Where are we sailing for? That's for you to tell me... since I'm no longer running this ship. We didn't say that, Peter. As Jeremy says, you've got the right. You've been with me from the first, and you've been loyal and true... followed me into every tight corner men could follow another. -But you always got us out. -And none the poorer for it. Yes, but on this occasion, there's no gold to be got. Do you think it was for gold we followed you? No, but I can see now I've not got the right to ask you to follow me. The girl is my concern, not yours. Are we gonna stand by and see this little snip laugh at our captain? There's Bishop's fleet. That might be paying a high price to keep from being laughed at. We're not yet such lily-livered scum as to be afraid of Col. Bishop. No. That is, not very afraid. Fie on you deserting our captain in this way... you scurvy traitors, you Judas Iscariots, you snakes in the grass... you wolves in sheep's clothing! I was only with them to spy on them. You'd better think carefully, lads. Yonder lies Jamaica, and straight we sail for it. -Aye. And straight we sail for it. -Aye! -Ahoy, the deck! -Ahoy! I have sighted Port Royal! Aye! Port Royal, you say? Aye, sir! There's something amiss! I see flashes of gunfire from ships in the harbor! -Fetch the Captain. -Aye, sir. Bugler, all hands on deck! lt's terrible to wake up at dawn dreaming of thunder. That's gunfire if I ever heard any. -There's a battle in Port Royal harbor. -How many ships do you make out? lt's hard to see clearly in the early morning light. I think there are two. lt's an attack on Port Royal, but who? Pirate craft, perhaps. Wish I could make out their flags. -Perhaps I can supply you the answer. -You can? Yes, if I may speak to so inaccessible a person. lf Port Royal is being attacked, they are likely French ships. French? You say Port RoyaI's attacked by the French? Why? When two countries are at war and one is attacked... who would it be but the enemy? What's this? France and England at war? You mean you don't know? Where have you been the past few months? At sea, out of touch with the world. The fire from the fortress is weakening! One ship is already firing on the town! That's strange. Where is the English fleet that's supposed to protect the town? lt's my turn to supply the answer. lt's out chasing pirates. Bishop would never let his fleet leave its post in time of war. He wouldn't dare. Col. Bishop, if I may say, is a very old and dear friend of mine. -lt's probably me he's after. -That fool! Blunder! And me in his own front yard. Shorten sail there, Wolf. Lend a hand forward, Andy. Stand by helm and keep her headed two points to larboard of the fort. Aye, aye, sir. Get your men to their stations, Chester. Port watch to stations! Speed there, lads! -Reef the fore topsail! -Aye, aye, sir! Take in the topgallant sail. May I ask, Captain, what are your intentions? Lord Willoughby, I set out to land you at Port Royal, but now.... Miss Bishop, an unlooked-for circumstance... prevents my landing you on your own dock. But I trust that if I put you ashore on the beach nearby... that would be equally satisfactory? -l-- -Thank you. Only please understand, this is a bargain... your freedom for my freedom. From now on, I no longer regard myself as a slave. My life's my own... even though I'm a thief and pirate. Capt. Blood, are you, an Englishman, thinking of leaving... when yonder, an English town is being taken? Hagthorpe, clear my deck and keep it cleared. -Aye, Peter, we'll take care of him. -Take your hands off! -Wait, lads. -Capt. Blood, I must talk to you. Very well then, Lord Willoughby. Myself, I've the honor to be Irish, but part of my crew's English. I was myself once, too, in loyalty. Of what should we be thinking? Of the chance to fight for your king. To fight for my king? Yes. He was loyal enough to send me to seek you out... to offer you pardon for your past crimes... freedom from your slavery and more than that... a commission in his own navy for you and your men. You hear that, Chester? The King wants us to join his navy! Read it for yourself. Lord Willoughby, you're a guest aboard my ship... and I've still some notion left me from better days of decent behavior... so I'll not be telling you what I think of this offer. All I'll say is, I wouldn't soil my hands with it... even though they're the hands of a thief and a pirate. But this concerns you, too, my lads. What do you say to serving the King? No! I'd like to serve him with a rope necktie. I'd rot before I'd serve him. I'd sink this ship with all hands before I'd serve him. lt would appear then that my crew is still a little dubious... as to the merits of His Majesty's offer. However you hate the King, England is still England. And a bad king is bad king, and worse one if he's James. James? This commission is sent by King William. King William? Who may King William be and what's he king of? I'm alluding to His Majesty, King William III, William of Orange... who, with Queen Mary, has come over from the Netherlands... and has been ruling England the past two months or more. They've roused themselves at home and kicked out that pimple James? Yes, and he's fled to France and he's in hiding there... and England and France are at war. The English people will go so far, Capt. Blood... and then they get up on their stubborn hind legs. -And William sent us this commission? -Yes. He knows you're good men, wrongfully sold into slavery. He can use good men in his navy. lt's the long-winded fellow you are. Why didn't you tell us this in the first place? Bugler, summon the men amidships! Men! I've just heard a startling piece of news. King James is kicked out of England and good King William reigns in his stead. For me, this changes the shape of the world. For you who were slaves with me... it means that we're no longer slaves. That we once more have a home and a country. For you who are English... it means a chance to fight for your native land... for I now propose to sail into Port Royal and take it from the French! Those of you who are not English... will have to be content with fighting for Capt. Blood... and the loot you'll find on the French ships. -Are you willing to fight, men? -Aye! Have we an English battle flag on board, Hagthorpe? We have every manner of battle flag, including a lady's purple petticoat. Wait, I've a better idea. When an English lion creeps up on a nest of French foxes... he wears a bushy tail. Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe. Keep her trimmed by the head, Wolf. Stand by the helm, Jeremy. Forward, men, to your stations. -ls that satisfactory to you? -Perfectly. Clear decks for action! Capt. Blood's orders. You'll be put ashore with these men. A ship is no place for a woman in time of battle. -I want to talk to him. -I'm sorry. The Captain's busy. -lnto the boat. -Aye, sir. Follow me, Miss Bishop. Musketeers, to your stations! A French ship. Hope we get on them before they discover the trick. -Andy. -Aye, Peter. Run to Hagthorpe. Tell him to fetch all the hot coals. -Put them by the guns. -Hot coals, sir? -No questions. Run. -Aye, aye, sir! Stand by ready to fire as soon as we come amidships. Stand ready to fire as soon as we've come amidships! Open your ports! Strike that French flag and hoist our own colors. Man your port guns! Ready, Hagthorpe? Fire! Hagthorpe, give them the hot galley broadside! Aye, Peter! Load them, lads! Hagthorpe, keep pounding that water line! We never miss. -That's one ship neatly disposed off. -Now for the other one. -Jeremy, helm quarter to port. -Aye, aye, Peter. Clear away that burning wreckage! -Port guns, Wolf. Hurry. -Aye, Peter. Man your port guns! Those French gunners must've learnt their trade in England. That's their third direct hit. Two guns out of order. Ship's taking water below. Replace them with two from the starboard side. -Keep hammering that waterline. -Aye, aye, sir. Lower gun deck's awash, we're sinking. What should we do? Do? We'll board a ship that's not sinking. Get your men forward. Aye, aye, sir. -What now, Peter? -Take the helm yourself, lad. Straight into them ! -We'll never do it, Peter! -Musketeers to the prow! Grappling hooks to larboard. Forward gunners, fire as hard as they can load! Rapid fire, men! Hagthorpe, double them up! They won't take it, Peter! They're blazing hot! Up into the shrouds, men! We're going to swing across on ropes. When we clear the rail, come over the side! Aye, aye, Peter! You and your men swing across into their rigging. When you see me cut down that French flag, drop down. Up, men, into the shrouds! Strong and sure! Grapnels over! All right, my hearties, follow me! Follow on, men! ''Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.'' ''Love thy neighbor as thyself.'' Leviticus 19:18. -Hurry, Cato. We'll be late. -Yes. The fleet's in already. -Stop! -Yes. Capt. Blood! Miss Bishop. I'll be on the veranda. I thought you'd gone. You can't be here. My uncle's just returned. -Yes, I know. -You know? -What are you going to do? -Just stay here. No, it's impossible. You mustn't stay here. -He's sworn he'll hang you. -I doubt he will. I've always been bad luck for your uncle. You can't know the threats he's made. The dreadful threats he's made. His whole life is spent in searching for you. -Now he's found me. -But you can still save yourself. Please, for my sake. For your sake? What do you mean for your sake? Isn't it true that you hate me? -Hate you? -Or is it that you love me? I'll hide you. And tonight after dark, I'll find some way-- You love me, don't you? Whom else would I love? Now will you? You love me! Lord Willoughby, she loves me! He'll be here any minute. I'll hide you somewhere. We'll hide together. I know just the place. How's this? You must be mad. He'll come here first. Good. I forgot to tell you. The Governor and I are on the best of terms. He lets me come and go here as I please. Look. -You can't arrest me! -I have, by order of the Governor. The Governor? You are mad. I am the governor. You mean, you were the governor. But we've changed that in your absence. What? You're broken for abandoning your post in time of war. Who are you? My name is Willoughby. I'm a special emissary of His Majesty the King. Lord Willoughby? -You were informed, I think, of my coming. -Yes. Yet you went off on some wild goose chase after a pirate... leaving your capital at the mercy of the enemy. Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter, as you may well find. Seeing that you hold your office from James... it's even possible the charge of treason lies against you. But, my lord-- I'm not concerned to hear your reasons, man. -His Excellency the Governor will. -The Governor? You'll find him inside. lt rests entirely with him whether you're hanged or not. This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood. What a reckoning there'll be when we meet. Have mercy, Your Excellency! -Arabella, why are you here? -Uncle! I have been pleading with the Governor on your behalf... asking him to be as merciful as you would be cruel. Uncle, this is the Governor. Good morning, Uncle. English
