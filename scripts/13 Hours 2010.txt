No problems. I have it easy. Sit down. I have made a casserole. No, I've had enough, I've already eaten on the plane. Let me pour you a glass of wine, he's very good. Relive your scoutingsdag you again? - No, no. Richard Ardis that is broken, the best thing then. And how is it in the United States? I've been promoted. And I can a nice apartment and can afford to cancel my second job. You know your mother and I love you help if you need money. Thanks, but you have me in the past enough help. And how are refurbishing, it seems a bit delayed. Things do not go as planned. The sale was canceled, but temporary. And so I have not come this way. And where is the terrible trio? - They are in the barn ... with friends, probably trying Stephen to his jeep to repair. It's just a waste of my money. I am also on 50 and go see do not break after every 500 meters. And mother? It is towards Edinburgh. No time for this type of pipeline Contributor, even on a Friday night. But she's here on Sunday and she can t wait to see you. You look tired. Why do not you bright and early to bed? I make sure the boys do a bit quiet. This is an excellent idea. Perhaps you young brothers their little sister need if the need is great. I will see, I play it for mother for once. I know you will. Good night. - Good night. Sarah ... Add the next time not so long about it. Okay, I promise. Back home. Come on guys. Come on guys, where are you now. Sorry guys, your turn is over. Look who's here is the first class whore has finally arrived. Why, hello half sister. Hello stranger. - Hi Stephen. Emily ... Hi Sister! - Hello Charlie. How's my brother? - Much better now that I see you. Sarah, remember me? Give me a hug. Hi Gary ... still the charmer, eh? And still single? Frank told me you would rejoice us with your presence. And I heard you had trouble again The jeep, for the umpteenth time? Oh yeah, you know. At least you're for a change once home, for whatever reason. And how is life today in L.A, Sarah? Pay the street still good? No, sorry, it's completely normal today. It will at least be better if other things, anyway. Or you just missed all this beauty here? No, they just missed me. There is no woman who is my back can resist. I do not think they keep that kind. Join us. Yeah, why not? - Good, good girl. Now I feel really one of the boys. - Yes, what exactly? Sarah ... just say Gary and help him out of his masturbation agony once and for all. Doug, I knew that somewhere would be it is the sky. As always, hello blue-eyed. Yes, and as always, hides Doug here for all his wild women. That is nasty. Another half point then? - Give me that. And where is Luke? He's recovering, but guys? - Together with Homer. Restoring what? That it is better to ask Dougie. It comes from a full inhalation of the weed called jammagamlak. So, Luke was able to get some fuck. Not bad for a thirteen year old. So, where is he? He uitgevloerd. - Totally exhausted. Hey baby. You're big. How do you feel? I heard you've had your first flying lesson. - Maybe. Homer at any rate. We call him now stoner. Hello. Why do not you lie in bed in the house? Mom and Dad had a big fight. What was that about? - I do not know, Sarah. Dad shouted about accounts and whether she had an affair. Why do not you go to bed, and then I get up tomorrow. You promise? You, will not leave us again to leave behind? No, I promise, I'm here for a few weeks. Why do not you sleep, I will take with me stoner. It will do him good to get some fresh to get air. Go ahead, kid. I'm not lying, I'm not lying. I swear on my mother's life. - Yes, if they really were. That is the way to say, I am a gentleman to so to speak. Everyone has a purpose, eh Charlie. That's too much information about the sex life of my brother. Okay, okay, let me tell you. You can not even play with a pig, Gary. - Julie is her name, she worked at J & D. Is that with that mustache? - No, the transvestite before surgery. Fuck you say, it's really a lot. She has an ass to be proud and big tits like you've never seen before. My goodness. - Sorry Sarah. What do you mean? What is wrong with mine? They're just not as nice as mine. - No, no, sorry for my language. Your breasts are fine, they are fine. They are actually pretty nice. Of course, I compare them to Emily. - Gary! We are in the pub and we got to talking, and asked her if she wanted to see my new engine. So I went for it and before I knew it They pounced on me ... and I got the chance, she pulled my zipper down and pulled it out. Damn jerk who you are, Stephen. And off we went! So, for the record, you are no longer the virgin who we thought? What? I am a virgin? I've just done on the backseat of Georgian Dragon, thank you. Okay, I understand now, you have the barmaid of Georgian Dragon a given turn. Gary has pinned the blonde barmaid with Lancelot are small. Fuck you, sarcastic jerk. It is not a dirty second hand. Whatever. Excuse me, I need the toilet. - I told you, whatever. You're an asshole Gary. Wait. Here we go. The girls here a reunion. Can I include? What? Can not I just pee quietly. I just wanted to see if you're OK - It's fine. And, how are you? I think there new developments have. Why you're here. - Come on, how long you're with Stephen. A couple of weeks if you want to know, And before you start ... We have one life, looks good, has brains, he knows what he is doing down there ... and he responds to my calls. Pretty important, Sarah. Sorry, but I'm so busy at my live there to build. I got you an e-mail. - Yes, Stephen said you came home, so I thought you up with everything. Would you stop now, because you know I do not may cry when someone else has problems. Yes, you've always been a stranger. And you're always been a cow. It is crazy what your phone did, man. It just did not matter when he fell. You're completely mad, man. Please look through the joint. I see the questioning of my girlfriend went well. So I think it's your turn. - What, Stephen? To make your sexual experiences. That should shed some light how you ended with those crappy job in the U.S., eh, Half Witt. No thanks, Half Witt. You know Sarah, the last 8 months have you done a great job with your radio silence. With all the arguments of separation, and so on and so forth. That's not fair, I've worked hard. - And even harder to hide. If one is hiding, it is you Stephen. And, when will you find a job. Or is it nice and cozy here. King of your castle - That's enough, both. Why has no one else told what is going on? This is not the time nor the place. Daddy ... Stepfather and for that matter, thinking that mom one ratio. And they paid huge sums loverboys. Do you imagine that what they money to do. I wonder what she really is tonight - Nonsense ... there must be another explanation. Yes, of course, as you head in the sand stabbing. Well done imp. Storm, rain and our empty house equals power failure, as usual, right? Okay? Yeah, okay. We have you in mind, we have more beer and cigarettes. I organize a raid party. You end up at the drink in my bed, because this is after all an emergency. You can get the candles out of the pantry, that you should be fine. And you? - Who has given you in charge? Well, you go and Luke out of bed. No, let him sleep. - Sorry, I'm trying to help him. But what I told Charlie, you can secret Cigarette stock clearance, If I sacrifice my drink. - How do you know? Because I'm your big brother. It is my job to know. You're his little brother from what I saw. And you use your imagination ... when we reach the top. And what about the replacement fuse? I ask Dad before I go go this beautiful woman. He's asleep. And why should I care? - We have the flashlight. Follow me. - Beware. Point the way but you. What a legacy your father left behind in our mother when he died years ago. It's more 'than one financial disaster' s pocket. I do get those candles. Take it easy, baby. - I'll go, I'll go. I have a fire. I'm an alpha male. - Loser. Okay, see you later. I would dare best bet. Fooled! You should not make jokes, Gary. You know what to do. And you, you stay with me. What is that? This place gives you shivers, does not it? Stephen? Stephen? It is your father's room! Dad is awake. No! Father. I do not want anymore, let's go. Damn. What the hell happened here. Stoner? Emily? Stoner? Emily come here! Close the door! What's going on? Stoner is dead, man. - Gary, run! What are you fucking doing. - Climb. What's going on? Stephen, you dirty bastard. So, what now? Help me! The door will not hold. What is that down there? - Do not leave me behind. Hurry up, guys. - Hurry up. It moves down there, come on. Go, go! Come on. Silence. What did I do? We need help. - How do you think we manage that. Do not talk so loud, Stephen. Does anyone have a cell phone? Mine is below in my bag, down at the piano. Where is yours, Stephen? Oh, no, no! Emily? - No. Doug? - Burn in the pub, remember. Well, I'm not. Does anyone have a pigeon? No, we stay here and wait for help. - Wait, Stephen, what about the gun? I have not closed the cabinet After the shooting last week. Honey, I do nothing better than that fucking thing by shooting his head, but to get the gun, you have to past it. Are there any volunteers? Listen, we stay here and wait for help, okay? I can not. - And why can not Sarah? Luke ... he may wake up. Unless Mom gets home? - I doubt it. Sorry Stephen, but you have no idea when this will be. Did you get that damn thing not you? - What's it really. What was that? - A wild dog? Who knows. Come on, you saw his height and his strength. No dog with rabies can get something like that. Except maybe the two dogs response to rabies, Stephen. Maybe it's the same as drug addicts who become psychotic. Maybe it is the same as animals with rabies. Maybe his brain is stamped and is now bleeding to death. Go check it, Doug, and finish as my father. There's a phone in mom ... Dad and his room. When we were there may come. - Halfling, Please stop. Luke is so stoned that he continues to sleep. - It's secure. Dare to bet your life on, Stephen? In order for the phone to go is a good idea. - Beth, guys. Look! Where will it go? This may be a way out. I should do. You know, right? You're right. I know. - Come on. I am stronger, faster. - Why you need to allow the other side. And, you're right, you are stronger! I can not see him as Charlie. Soldier should, and replaces the lady, if necessary. We can not ask of you, soldier. We need your strength. Keep an eye on my sister. And keep your hands off. And if you hear Charlie, do not back to me, and make that call. Sarah ... good luck. This is a damn bad idea you know, right? Do you have a better idea then, Stephen? Charlie Now! Now! Help me with this. - No Charlie, do not. Do not do it Charlie! - There is no other way. Jump. Hurry up! It comes to me. / i It seems to me, you asshole! Simone. Wait, it stopped. Please Let go. - What are you doing? Let go! with the police. / i There is a kind wild animal in our house. sorry sir, I can not well understood. / i It has killed our father. Charlie! Charlie! Speak clearly what please. / i - Wait a minute. Charlie! Doug! - Get down! Keep your head! The storm is over, dogs and bitches. There is nothing wrong. Asshole! Good evening, officer. A little lost? No, McGrey. I want you up and stuff come with me. Need a reason to drag me into a Piss night like this? We've got a bell on unleashed animals, it will be invented. Than the normal amount, times half. That's between you and accounting. Just grab your stuff, let's go. Hey, not in here. Sorry, Officer May. You're lucky ... I have pay for it. I told you it was a bad idea. God knows why Charley to you listen. Stephen, shut up. He would hear us. - I guess he now knows. I can not remember so that you was influenced. That happened to you when you go to America? Dying all rational thoughts it off? And who was it who was not screaming? Who was next before, Stephen? You are not the king of your castle. You're just a village idiot. Fuck you, sister! Fuck! You can not blame me. - Stop it, this will not help. Okay, sorry Doug. You know what ... Emily and I leave it up to my half sister her panties sniffing. Let me tell you something ... you are such an asshole. Does anyone know if Charlie the phone has managed to achieve? Did he call? How can we doubt? - I think I heard him whisper. Yes, begging for his life. What are you doing? Where you going? - I'm not staying here with these two losers. And Doug, to enjoy delving into the family gene pool. Stephen ... - If you have not already. Stephen, do not! Sarah, I'm sorry. Stephen, wait! He is wrong. It does not matter ... maybe he's not wrong, and is it to the genes. He is wrong. Stephen, I think this is nothing. - Hurry simply. Stephen ... what are these? - They are not mine. They are of Charlie. Stephen wait! That thing must be so hard? Do we really need those sirens? It is not really determined rush hour, either? You know that expression: "Wasted police time?" See anything? - No, nothing. Let me. Careful. Stay on the massive wooden joists. Thanks. How are you with your ankle? I survive it. Stay tuned. Nothing on this side. Where is the hell. You left me bad scare. - Sorry. You okay? What are you doing? Looking for trouble. So, you've seen the light, and you asked you wonder what you had with my brother? He is under a lot of tension. He doing his best. We are all under pressure here, Emily. Stress affects your loyalty to, say. - Loyalty ... Have you any idea how life is here without my best friend? Calm again, Emily. I have nothing due to my mom's PR contacts. I sit here by myself. Stephen gives me at least one reason to get out of bed. You mean in bed. Oh, come on. - Fuck you with my brother to get back to me? What are you saying? Do you know anything of self-respect that slutty person that you've made? Sarah, you should hasten stop it, okay? Defend your tweedehandsjes? Maybe you and Stephen seem to be more alike than you'd like to admit. Stephen and I have decided to for the gun to go. How? That's fucking stupid. - I 've had to explain myself to you. If there is a way, I feel sure safer with a shotgun and between us. Until later. I agree with the rest. I'll be back. Is there any kind of warranty with? Do not worry. I come with a lifetime warranty. Hold it down again. How do they get it done. Stephen, I'm stuck. I can not. Are these really Charlie? I'm sorry, I did not want about him. Okay? Look at me. It'll be okay. With all of you. Stephen, do not. Stephen, Stop it. Stop it, Stephen! Guys, something is moving down there. Come on Stephen, come on. Come on, Stephen. Stop with that. Get out of there. - What's in there? Guys, get out! It can help us wall block. Help me, Stephen. Do it damn it, Stephen. This does not happen. Stephen, help me. Help me against it in the closet pushing. Is it loaded? Stephen, is it loaded? I do not know ... Over there, hold it down again. Damn you, Stephen. Stephen ... Stephen? Oh, my God! It's in the room ... It's in the room. It's in the room. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry too. Emily, we have here. - Yes. Where's Stephen? Where is he? Emily, you're okay. - You dirty bastard. I had to, otherwise we caught. I have the gun, look! You set me run. You lied to me. Keep this up. Stop it! Keep your head down. Is anyone hurt? - We are fine. You know why? Because those fool here ... taught me to take a hunting rifle to go. You know what your problem is, Stephen? No? I thought so .. It surprises me nothing. Stay there, Doug. I have shotgun here, remember? Emily ... - Defend your brother! He deserves your help. You, you walk with your nose in the air thinking you hold everyone, including me. And then I thought ... why you suddenly I became interested two months back? Did you think Sarah would come home? Did you think I am with her head went to play around? Maybe I just fucking with you to its return address. You'd never admit it, do you? And you know why? Because you're a maggot-free backpack, Stephen. Asshole. Fuck with me. - So now let me see what I'm capable of. I go through that door, and I take this rifle. I'll look for that thing ... And then blow his head off! Have you ever heard the expression "Driver change?" I press against it. That makes the blood curdle. Thanks. How's your ankle? It's not as bad as that I thought. It's okay, Stephen. Let me have a look. Let me now take a look! Emily, where are you? - I do not have it. She said ... - Does it really matter? My best friend is dead. My stepfather is dead. One of my brothers are dead. And you, you do not have them slain. Do you understand? It was ... being. What is that thing down there? Like I said ... Does it even matter? Doug! I saw the gun does not. What do we do now? We have to leave. - How? We have nowhere else to go ... except upwards. are worthless. Well? The car will not start anymore. No power, no fuel. He seems to stand for a while. - Look at this post. Look at the name and address on the license. - Is this ...? Indeed. Where did she go? See anything? No, the coast is clear. What will we do if We can come off the roof? Can we get the jeep going? I must look into it, there's a rental car. - It was locked. The key is in my bag. Doug, you can open it. I love how you think about me, Stephen. - Can you or not? An old Escort or I get up and running, but not so modern in those days. Tide and we did not, so but let us worry about that later. What a plan. Well, it's a plan. Her car broke down. She is going to help search. Case closed. You go look. That suits you. You need to rest. - I'm almost through. I see or hear nothing. That you should not do. You could best help, right? - Two words for this, satellite navigation. She leave her handbag. - What? She leave her handbag. What surprises me: she never leaves her purse behind. Really? - Maybe she was not bad luck ... maybe she went to investigate, and maybe she did not come back because ... This is not a joke? Boys! We're almost there. - Yes. Okay, this road is another kilometer. Hello? Guys? It's over. Henry? I'm here. Father? - Luke? Be quiet. Run, Luke, run. - Do what your sister says, you hear me! Exit the house, now! - Father? Not again. Sarah? Sarah! Run! We're out of here ... now! Run. - Running, running. Come on. - Hurry up. Pull over. Hurry. - I have to shoot, move. Come on! - Come on, hurry up! Go! Where is it? Yet a few hundred meters, it will be behind the trees. It was time. When we get there, give me time to my pack up. Are you okay? I'm fine. Where is dad? Where's Charlie? He did not make it, sorry. We can not stay here. - Do you know something better? Look! There's someone through it. Let's go. Pack your stuff. - Wait a minute, I told you I ... Come on. Come on. I shoot the bastard down. I can certainly wait. Damn! - Help him, Stephen. Can he run. - As if he has a choice. What the hell? Wait. Wait. - Silence. They're dead. - What? They're dead. Are we in trouble? - We can go the goddamn police car! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on ... Come on. Damn. What is she doing? - What is she doing? Anybody out there? Hello? Go on. Go on. Let's go. - Come on! How is that? Stephen, can you fix it? Stephen? Need help? - Why do not Thurs, Douglas. Doug, do you take me to the bathroom? Honey, go along with Doug. You can hide and be still. Luke, I bet Stephen de jeep the talk and then we get away. Come on. - Take care. Go ahead. It's good, I promise. Please say it to you can get underway, Stephen. I think you, me and Luke are the only survivors of this family. You should look at this. Did you hear me, Stephen? He can not be gotten under way be. How can you be so sure? Because the part we need Mom sits in the boot of her cunt. I reached her flat tire, dirty slut. What did you say? I reached her flat tire before in went into the cafe. I tried to avoid that she would meet her lover. Stupid bitch. I can not be there to see her. Luke said she was standing in the pouring rain, desperately trying to change her tire. Dad did not help her, and it took her almost one hour. Is not that funny? This is a police car, Stephen. If your hair had not delay ... she was probably with her lover having sex. Do you understand that, Stephen? Our mother is probably dead. And if she is ... is your fault. You can not buck on me. If it is not that guy from Sussex went into the bed is ... that take your damn back! It's not my fault she's dead! You take that back! - No. You take the fuck back! You've broken my nose. What the hell happened? What was that? Where's Stephen? He's gone. What? - He hit by ... and I could not stop him. He was terrified. I think I got him injured, but ... I remember nothing after he hit me. - He has beaten you? It's too late. And the jeep will not start. My family is ... Jesus, you totally glowing. You must promise me that for Luke I'll make it if something happened. I promise. He is now okay. He's asleep now. Jesus! It's okay. He sleeps like a rose. We need a plan. Not here. Not now. You said that even in that room. Olivia, stop it! What's going on? - Nothing Luke, we think the next step. Sarah, what is it? Sarah? Doug! Doug! It's Sarah! Get out. Get out! Get out of here with me! Where's Stephen? - Sarah! You said you would leave me alone, Sarah! Where can we hide? Big mistake, big mistake. Why is there so much unnecessary mess here? Come on, come on. Hello, hello, sir? Sir, hello. / I Sarah? Sarah! Move on! Help me. Help me! Please! Close the door. Go into the car and shut the door locked. Listen, please listen to me.
