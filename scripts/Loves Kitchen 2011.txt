No sherry, I guarantee. Absolutely wonderful. Good Alfie, how about one last cold beer? Do you mind if I call the Bertie? The more the merrier. Left half barrel. Great . The mysterious motorcyclist. It's very flattering. -God. Indeed. I came to inform you can reopen. How? Why? I suggest you get in the car and go to ask Kate. Oh no. Why men are so stupid sometimes? Forgiveness? Who do you think was the board this morning save your bacon? -You're kidding. No, I'm not. But she also wrote that terrible review. -Rob? One moment. -Rob? -Jesus. -Loz, bring him a drink. -Rob . What? Do not be an idiot. She did you a favor. Christ. And, despite everything, she still likes you. She likes ? -If not behind her now... Where is she? Lndo airport. He never exceeds twenty miles an hour. -You will need to do better than that. No way. Well, I better start painting. I'm sorry. You must be joking. Kate. Stop. Stop. See? I never ran over anyone, nor when deserved to be hit. So is 20 kilometers per hour or so ? -All or nothing. -It is difficult for the car, no? You need to take risks from time to time. True? -I was an idiot. Yes, you were. And you were right. My food was terrible, terrible. You reminded me of who I was, who I should be ... And who I could be. I know that the British are bad in statements and I even worse... But wanted you to know that everything has changed because of you. Wanted you to know before you go. That's very sweet. But I could have told me next Wednesday. What? -Just stay in Paris one week. No matter if it was a week a day or an hour, it was worth it. From now on, I'll drive. Why? I think it ended well. Here we have another great meal in contact with the surroundings. More proof, is still needed... That our cuisine can face... Our continental cousins  as equals. So how good guide says: worth the detour. Bon Appetit. What the hell are you looking at? Back to work.
