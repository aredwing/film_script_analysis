You are the only one who is playing with me ! You do not love me, you negotiate love! Reshma ji, love is not defenseless. Love is a beautiful gift from God. That only the receipt of Pooja. Again Pooja, who is Pooja? What has that Pooja I do not have? She has nothing what you have. She is not rich like you, nor so arrogant. She also tries to buy love. She does not play with the heart of people. Do you know? When I was desperate and pawned my love with you .. Should have something, in this house .. ..ella Not complain. Now understand what the difference between you and my Pooja? You're wrong, Roop. I did all this because I love you. No girl can love you as much as I love you . Nobody loves you as much as me! I can not share you with no else. Look at me, look into my eyes. I love you, Roop. I love you. I love you more than anything in this world. Lie! You do not understand that love can buy! Love is not available on the market , lady! First you must learn to love herself , Reshma ji! After that, expect love in return. - Where are you going? - Enough, enough Reshma ji. Now let me go.

Detente. - Brother, do you know where Pooja lives? - Pooja is married. No brother, I'm talking about girl who works at the hospital. Yes, the same Pooja. She is getting married. - What? - What are you saying? Pooja! Pooja! Who are you? Why are you shouting the name of the bride? Pooja! Who is he? I'm going to break his bones! Pooja, what are you doing? How can you marry someone else? Questioning things no sense now, Roop. Get out of here. Get out of here. What I'm going where? Why should I leave? My destiny brought me here! Pooja, you are my destiny! You are my life! And I will not leave here without you! I will not go me! I'll sit here! Why do not you go? Why do not you go? Tell me! When we parted, do you know who I support? It was him! Who was the one who helped me forget ? Was the! And now you come back and ask me to leave everything to run away with you? Why Roop? Because you love me. For you, love and marriage does not mean anything, right? But now in my life another man entered. And this good and decent man loves me much. Should I betray him? Should I insult everyone who came here to bless ? Should I take your hand and run you? Tell me! No! Do not! You're right, Pooja. This is your place. I came to the wrong place. May God keep you happy and a brother. Come on, we're leaving. Roop. Pooja was yours is yours and will continue to be yours. How good you came. Otherwise, Pooja would become my wife.

With great difficulty I freed myself! - I will not go anywhere! - Are you crazy! Why do not you understand? Explain it! - Let's go see it! - I will not go. Nobody ever get rid of it! - For the love of God, come! - I will not go with you. - I beg you, come with me! - I will not go! Narang men are waiting . Let them wait, let them wait. I will not run away! I'm not going to run away! Narang is a very dangerous man. Do not mess with him. - I will not go. - Brother Roop, he's right. Narang is very dangerous. Take Pooja and go .. ..for The back door. We take care of everything. Roop not have time to think. Huye with Pooja. How long? For how long I'll keep running away? I was in the wrong way enough time!
