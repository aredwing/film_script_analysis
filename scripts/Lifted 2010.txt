I don't want to walk back. Oh. Okay. Give me a beatbox. Come on, it's too early. Come on now. [Beatboxing] # I don't feel that just because my missus # # Turned me down for a ride # Won't let it hurt my pride # I have to let it slide # If she prefer her two-wheel # To the feel of my four # I will kiss her then I'll miss her # # As she walk out the door # 'cause she the prettiest thing that you ever did meet # # Sure to stop traffic right there in the street # # And every time my wife is away from me # # My heart gets heavy and I hear a melody # # About the clouds moving in to grip the sky # # You know just what I'm talking 'bout # # So sing about why # Ain't no sunshine when she's gone # # It's not warm when she's away # [Beatboxing] # Ain't no sunshine when she's gone # # She's always gone too long # Anytime she goes away Genius son of ours, ain't he? Mm-hmm. Good genes. # Wonder this time where she's gone # # Wonder if she's gone to stay # Ain't no sunshine when she's gone # # This house just ain't no home # # Anytime she goes away # I know I know I know I know I know I know I know # # Hey # I ought to leave the young thing alone # # But there ain't no sunshine when she's gone # # Anytime she goes away [Indistinct chatter] [Mimics explosion] [Brakes squeal] See you later, bud. See you, dad. [Indistinct chatter] Hey, Matthews. What's that in your pants? Your mom still so high she can't even potty-train you? [Kids laugh] [Rattling] I've been sober for a year and two months. [Applause] [Sighs] On my way here, I had to pass by my old stomping ground. All the people I used to get high with are... Still there. Still shooting up. Mm-hmm. I miss it... Getting high. That scares the living daylights out of me. But you know, I mean, the second that I feel that, The second I get tempted, I just think about my husband And my boy. They're my world, My love. They're my high. Mm-hmm. It helps me fight my temptations, Stay on the path. [Sighs] Day by day. That's right, girl. Yeah, that's right. [School bell ringing] Get him. Come back here, chicken. Get him! Where you gonna go, Matthews? He's going in the church. Hey! Hey, hey. Can I help you? Are y'all here for prayer meeting? No. Sorry. We're leaving. I think you're safe now, But I'd wait a second before I leave. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Hey, William. Hey, Carl. How's it going? Oh, the same old, same old. What you got? There. And... There. [Grumbles] Bills, bills, and more bills. Sorry. I do have something else for you, But it's addressed to your house. You want it? Why not? All righty. You be good. You take care. [Light piano music] Do you play? Not really. Oh, son, you either play or you don't play. Well, I do, but I don't have a piano like that. You ever played a real piano before? No, sir. You want to try? Come on up here. [Chuckles] Come on. Play whatever you want. What was that you were just playing? Just a little something I was working on for worship service. Here, you want to try? All right. Here you go. [Soothing piano music] # Come inside my heart # Come inside, it's glorious # Come inside, spirit # There's nothing more # There's nothing less # Come inside my soul # Come inside, my glorious # Love can make you whole # Want nothing more # Want nothing less # Beautiful # Spirit # Wonderful # Spirit # Marvelous # Spirit Mm. Mm-mm-mm. Mrs. Declaire, I think we're in the presence of an angel. Hmm. If there be any angels up in here, How come they ain't helping me with these books? [Chuckling] I'm not gonna be long, babe. I don't know if I can manage without you. 'cause the last time you left, I had- Hey. Shh. You stop that. You've grown, babe. [Sighs] You're not the same person you were then. Work the program. Meetings every day. You'll see. Time will fly. [Sighs] Okay. Okay. It will. It will. [Sniffles] Our income's gonna suffer, So you're gonna have to cut back some, okay? [Door creaks open and closes softly] What's going on? Mom. What's wrong with you? Hey. There's nothing wrong with your mom, Henry. She's fine. Then what's going on? I've been recalled to active duty, son. I'm leaving... For Afghanistan in a few weeks. How could they do this? This isn't fair. You've already been to Iraq. Henry. I know this doesn't seem fair to you, But this is my choice. The money that I've been paid as a reservist Helped your mama get better. It allowed me to put a down payment on this house In this neighborhood. Now it's my turn to keep my word. You understand? [Door shuts] He'll be fine. He'll be fine. [Delicate music plays] [Knock at door] [Music clicks off] [Sighs] I'm sorry. Hey, I'm not mad at you. I'm just- I know. It stinks big time. You know I'm gonna need someone To keep something safe for me while I'm gone. Really? Really. But you're gonna have to email me Some of your new recorded stuff, Because I got to show my son off while I'm over there. Wait, you can get emails over there? Yeah. I might can't check them every day, But they got computers. I was playing a real piano today, And it was amazing. Where? At the baptist church down on main street. And what were you doing there? Just stopped by. And we ended up composing a song together. Did he try to talk you into joining his church? No. Did he talk to you about the bible? No. Did he pour water over your head While you weren't looking? No. I ain't never heard of a pastor like that before. So you gonna play me a song or what? Oh, okay. Uh... I just added a new beat. [Clears throat] [Soothing keyboard music] # Come inside my heart # Come inside, it's glorious # Come inside, spirit # There's nothing more # There's nothing less # Come inside my soul # Come inside, my glorious # Love can make you whole # Want nothing more # Want nothing less # Beautiful # Spirit # Wonderful # Spirit # Marvelous # Spirit # Holy, holy # Spirit # We be living down here in the bible belt # # Where some say a strong presence of the lord is felt # # And people fear the devil # Prepare me for the next level # # We ain't seen you at church, now you a rebel? # # Questioning god is natural # Look at circumstances # 'cause man created the bad # The way the devil dances # God is beauty and love # The search within your heart # So if you need to practice faith # # Go and play your part # Beautiful # Spirit # Wonderful # Spirit # Marvelous # Spirit Whoo-hoo! [Clapping] Whoo-hoo! [Laughs and claps] Well, I guess that's it. [Sighs] You know what your job is, right? What is it? Take care of mom. No, bud. That's mom's job. Your job is to go to school. But most important, You sing... Every day, All the time. You hear? Okay. It'll be all right. Yeah. I promise. You don't have to worry. [Sniffles] [Breathes deeply] [Sniffling] [Alarm ringing] [Wistful music] [Faint applause] [Wistful music continues] [Man singing distantly in foreign language] [Indistinct radio chatter and motor rumbling] [Helicopter rotors whirring] Need help with that? Yes, sir, sergeant. What you got there, man? Some new music from your little blue-eyed soul wonder? You know it. Let me hear some, man. Come on. [Passionate guitar chords strumming] # Walking down a cold and lonely road # # I feel so much pain, sadness, and hurt # # Down in my soul [Bluesy rock music] # Wondering will I ever see your face again? # # And will the weight in my heart ever be lifted? # Are you sure that's a white boy, man? Come on. # I open up my eyes, I miss you # # Every time I fall asleep, I miss you # # I want to scream - Your boy got some flavor, man. - Uh-huh. # Every day is all about how I miss you # # Every time I close my eyes, I miss you # # Every day, walking the streets to be near you # All right. # I feel you # How can I help it? # You know I miss you He leaves this part instrumental For me to freestyle. Oh, does he, now? So let me see something. Let me hear something, man. What's going on? - You first. - Come on, man. Oh, all right. It's like that? # I miss her much # You know she gold # My version of Janet Jackson # # With a little extra bit of soul # # You know how we roll # Off the wall, on the floor # By the shore # Of the beautiful river Jordan # # Early in the morning till we get up out this sand trap # # With terminator gat # On an adrenaline high # Semper fi, do or die # # Cross the line, bullets fly # # 'cause it's you or I # Guns smoking like sun spots # Who got the drop? # My band of brothers light it up # # Keeping it hot, hoo-ah! # All: # Hoo-ah! Come on. Check it. # It's the little things I miss the most # # At home with my son sharing the mic post # # When we suddenly overcome # With the smell of my wife's roast # # Then we both know to finish the song # # I'm spitting, he's hitting the right notes # # If y'all were sitting there hearing it # # You would be swearing it couldn't be white folks # # And I might boast # 'cause all that I have to grasp # # Are weapons and rifles # As long as I rep with my brother disciples # # But a light goes, give me restart # # I can't see the eyes of my son # # And I welcome the day to lay down my gun # # And into my arms he will run # I open up my eyes, I miss you # # Every time I fall asleep, I miss you # # I want to scream and shout How can you do this? Is this legal? You listen to me. My husband is in Afghanistan. He's serving this country. Do you understand? If you're so sorry, Then why are you doing this to us? I have to go now. What's going on, mom? [Sighing] It seems that we can't cover our mortgage On your father's military salary. What? The house is going into foreclosure. No. No, wait. I'll get a job. No. If anybody gets a job, it's gonna be me. And I just- I tried for four months, But it-you know? This was apparently a bad mortgage That the bank tricked us into signing with lower rates, And now they want to raise those rates To three times as much and- Which I don't understand. And they don't care that your father's on active duty. What are we supposed to do? I mean, we can't just leave the house That dad expects to come back to. Okay, well, baby, what are our options? Should we tell him That we lost the house while he's in Afghanistan, Where he can do absolutely nothing about it but worry? Where are we gonna live? [Sighs] Well... Until I get a job, we'll have to stay with my dad. What? No, mom, he hates me. He doesn't hate you. He just- he doesn't like the music You and your dad listen to. So just wear your headphones while you're there. It'll be fine. I promise you, it's just gonna be For a short little while, okay? [Sighs] [Ignition turns over] [Slow beeping] [Dog barks distantly] Hi, dad. Mm. I told you not to marry him, didn't I? Always thinking he's better than us. But have I ever lost the roof over my head, hmm? No, you haven't. Mm. That's not all coming inside. I'll tell you that. No, we'll store most of this stuff at a friend's. It's just for tonight. Come on, baby. Hey, Lisa. Hey. You can store some of that stuff in here if you want. I got room for you. No, that's okay. No, mom. Let me carry this one. He ain't wearing those kind of clothes around here, Lisa. This ain't no jungle bunny ghetto. You hear me? I hear you. [Sighs] [Rooster crows] Morning, mom. [Sighs] Morning, baby. Do me a favor and wear that today. Why? [Glass clinking] Henry, baby, please. I just want to keep the peace while we're here, okay? Mom, I can't wear this to school. I'm gonna get a beating. Wow. You've grown. Mom! Henry, it's not that bad. Let me see your hem. It's not that bad. Anyway, you're much more likely to get a beating From your grandpa from wearing those baggy pants. I got to go. What about breakfast? No, thank you. I'm late. Ugh. Henry. Henry! Henry, you have to eat something. [Sighs] Hey, I'll eat it. [Chuckles] So... You're sober now, huh? Yeah. A year and ten months. Well, too bad. 'cause I got me some of the finest local right here. Oh, Clayton, put that away, please. You sure? Just one little hit? No. I have to go to my meeting. [Sighs] Suit yourself. - Honey, your backpack. - Thanks, mom. [Indistinct chatter] I'll be damned. Eminem turned into Peewee Herman. Look at his pants. [Laughter] Tell your mom to stop buying crack and buy you some clothes. And why don't you tell your mom to stop stuffing her face so she can fit through the front door again? Ooh-hoo. - What'd you say? - You heard me. Hey! Class. After school. [Sighs] [Breathes deeply] [Sighs] My husband is still in Afghanistan. And we lost our house. So... We have to stay with my dad. And this morning, His neighbor offered me a hit. I told him to put it away, And I left. But I really wanted a hit so bad. I imagine that moment when All your problems disappear. I just miss my husband so much. And I worry about him so much. The idea of not worrying, Not missing And feeling Just... A few moments of peace Is just so tempting. You know, but I prayed. And I didn't give in to that temptation. So for today, I'm okay. [Applause] [School bell ringing] You little wimp. We're gonna get you. No hiding. [Rapid footsteps] [Footsteps thundering] Let's go. We'll get him next time. [Sighs] Aren't these guys getting tired of this already? [Sighs] I wish they would. Mm. Come on. Sit down. "Alabama Teen Starquest." Think about taking part in this?

You think so? Yeah. Why don't we go downstairs and make a copy of this flyer? All right. [Indistinct chatter] [Cell phone ringing] Hello? Hi, baby. Hi, darlin'. Oh, my god! I miss you so much.

I can't wait to come home. Is he back from school yet? Uh, no, not yet. He's been spending a lot of time with pastor Johnson, Which makes me actually kind of glad, 'cause I'd rather him be there than- - What do you mean? - [Stammers] You know, nothing. Nothing. It's just he's been spending Quite a bit of time in his room, you know? Behind the computer. It can't be healthy. Don't worry, babe. The kid just loves his music. Music ain't never been bad for anybody. Oh! Speak of the devil! Yeah, yeah, here he comes a-running. Come on, it's your dad. Okay, hold on. Here he is. Dad? Dad? Hey, buddy. What's going on? - Guess what. - What? Okay, so pastor Johnson found A singing competition for teens in Birmingham. I could win $5,000. Really? Well, you gonna do it? I don't know. I'm really nervous. I wish you could be there with me, you know. Help me choose some songs, freestyle some. Well, when is it? Uh, in a couple of months. - Well, I could be back by then. - Really? Yeah, they're talking about shortening our deployment. We'll do it together. Okay. But if you're not here by then, I might have to do it on my own. 'cause I really want to win the money. I will be there. We'll win it together. Cool. [Alarm blares loudly, phone crackles] Hey, what's that? It's just a gate call, But I'm sergeant of the watch, so I got to go. Tell mom I love her, okay? Okay, I will. Bye. Hi, baby. No, mom. He had to go. Well... I barely got to talk to him.

[Passionate guitar chords strumming] # Ooh # Ooh-ooh-ooh # Walking down this cold, dark, lonely road # # I feel so much pain, sadness, and hurt # # Down in my soul [Bluesy rock music] # Wondering will I ever see your face again? # # And will the weight in my heart # # Ever be lifted? # Whoa-oh-whoa # I open up my eyes, I miss you # # Every time I fall asleep, I miss you # # I want to scream and shout how I miss you # # Every day is all about how I miss you # # Every time I close my eyes, I miss you # # Every day, walking the streets to be near you # # When I drop my beats, I feel you # # How can I help it? # You know I miss you # It's the little things I miss the most # # At home with my son sharing the mic post # # When we suddenly overcome # With the smell of my wife's roast # # Then we both know to finish the song # # I'm spitting, he's hitting the right notes # # If y'all were sitting there hearing it # # You would be swearing it couldn't be white folks # # And I might boast # 'cause all that I have to grasp # # Are weapons and rifles # I'm a go where the fight goes # # As long as I rep with my brother disciples # # But a light goes, give me restart # # I can't see the eyes of my son # # And I welcome the day to lay down my gun # # And into my arms he will run # Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah # I open up my eyes, I miss you # # Every time I fall asleep, I miss you # # I want to scream and shout how I miss you # # Every day is all about how I miss you # # Every time I close my eyes, I miss you # # Every day I'm walking the streets # # To be near you # When I drop my beats, I feel you # # How can I, how can I let you know # # How much I miss you # Whoa-oh [Music fades] [Cheers and applause] Judges, what do you think?

[Cheers and applause] Chops. Let's hear from miss Darlene. Well, yes, you've got a good voice, But this is a singing competition. You've only got a minute and a half for your song. You should use this time to sing Instead of that other nonsense. [Crowd oohs] Think we could switch seats? Oh, no way, buddy. Not even for you, pal. All right, let's see what the judges' scores are. Bubba, what you got? Ten, Al. Ten from Bubba. Jimmy, what do you say? Jimmy gives you a nine. Just like that, 19 points. Darlene? Oh, well. [Chuckles] [Crowd booing] No surprise there.

I won't even leave his side till he's at least 21. [Sighs] I don't know if I can do this without you. What? Sing. I'll be there. I know. But...I don't know why I thought you'd be there. I mean, I don't know if I can perform by myself. I think you can. Now remind me how this next round works. Well, the person with the lowest score's out. And then it's between the two finalists. I really just want to win the money So mom and I can start over somewhere. I know, son. You think you can get through this round alone? I've got to go see someone, A friend that's gonna perform with you. No, dad. Trust me, Henry. It'll be just like having me up there. Except... He's a little more alive. Dad? Yeah. What's it like, Being dead? I'm not quite sure how to explain. I'm pretty new at this. All I know is that I understand certain things now. Like what? Where I am now Feels like home. And I realize now that From this point of view, Life Is merely as long as a roller coaster ride At the county fair. What I'm trying to say to you is, Enjoy the ride. Always keep those eyes open, Even right before the scary drop. Heck, raise your arms up high especially before the drop. Experience every single moment With every fiber in your body. That's why you bought the ticket in the first place. You understand? Just make it through this next round. Will you be back? Henry, Even if you may not be able to see me anymore, Know... That I will always be there. [Sniffles] I love you, son. I love you, dad. [Church bells tolling] [Indistinct speech on TV] Man, you got to lay off the sauce, brother. A curious incident happened at the Alabama Teen Starquest. Celebrity guest judge Jimmy Knox was accused of assault By one of the young participant's grandfathers, Travis Parker. Damn. To add another strange twist to the story, The man's grandson, Henry Matthews, Was named by Jimmy Knox to be the favorite to win... Henry Matthews. I guess we're just gonna have to see If the young fella can overcome Whatever family drama he has going on. Traffic is backed right up. Thank you. "Jeremy, "bro, if you're reading this letter, "I'm dead. "man, that would really stink. "let me just say it was an honor serving with you, "and I'd like to ask you a favor, "knowing that you're the only one "I could trust with this request.
