Come along. Vladimir Nikolaevich! Don't worry. We'll take care of it. You step aside please. - Really, you don't have to. - We'll do it. Come give me a hand. Take it. And ONE, TWO, THREE! Let's get it one more time. ONE...TWO...THREE! Total chaos in the district. Is it really that hard to put up a road barrier? We do put them, but they get stolen. Also, it's the maintenance people who answer for that. Are you the maintenance? - You?! - What can maintenance people do about it, when they don't even get a tool shed? What can they do? I have an offer. What offer? We've purchased some Japanese technology. It cleans, sweeps and washes all by itself. Would you like to see it? We do. I cannot. - My mom is... - We'll convince her. Mom. - Mom, we have guests. - Hello! You're still sick, mommy-o? Maksim Petrovich, why did you come down personally? I already told Margunin I'd start tomorrow... By no means! Stay in bed until you've fully recovered. This is comrade Teterin, our new district prefect. And if you need anything, you let me know. - Don't be shy - Oh, I'll tell him, you parasite! I'll tell him everything. For two years now I ask himto make me a tool shed. They won't lift a finger. Meanwhile I come home, and the rubber hose is stolen! And that's how it goes, mister Prefect. Well I hope you got the message now? Here's my direct phone line. If you need anything, do call me. I'll be glad to hear from you. Meanwhile, we wanted to show your daughter some Japanese technology. - Any objections? - Mom, I told them I couldn't... Yeah? Why can't you? Go have fun, no use sitting at home. You've sat long enough. If there's a heaviness upon my heart In her alone I seek the answer And not because she radiates a light But because with her one does not need light. And in the circle of universes, And in the twilight of the brooding hour - There's but one star whose name my lips repeat... - Please watch the road, or we'll crash. Yes, ma'am! Oh Nastya, Nastya! What? - This is what I wanted to avoid. It's what I feared... - What did you fear? I was afraid to fall in love. - Please don't laugh. It's serious. It only seems that way to you. You do not know me at all. - I've fallen in love, perhaps for the very first time... - Vladimir Nikolaevich, please stop the car now! They're selling red beets there! I must buy some for the borscht. But only on one condition. You must stay in the car. - Teterin speaking. - Vladimir Nikolaevich, the mayor is looking for you. - Tell him I am meeting with constituents - Got it! - Also, the Japanese are here... - I said I'd be in at 1pm. 1pm! Over and out! Oh my lord, they act like children. They can't take any decisions themselves. Maybe just to hell with it all, and let's drive out somewhere scenic to relax? Vladimir Nikolaevich, you are expected by you constituents, and me- by my mom. And in the twilight of the brooding hour There's but one star whose name my lips repeat Could you please tell me, Ivan the Terrible Street- is that the old Liberty Street? No. It's the old Clara Zetkin street. Thank you. Excuse me, does Aleksandr Pechogin live here? - Which one is that? - A young guy, not very tall. Ah, Sashka! Yes. - who's against? -me - who abstains? -me - adopted! - i'm still against!... you're welcome! In a Dark Age of transition, everywhere and always the worst scum of every society rises to the top And it not only lacks objectives, but also any sign of contemplation. It expresses with all its might only its own restlessness and impatience. Meanwhile this well-known scum unwittingly comes under the influence of a tightly-knit clique of a so-called vanguard who act with a specific aim - Excuse me, where can I find Sasha? Down the corridor, to the left. Second door after the kitchen. - ...and other idiots, which also happens. brilliant, isn't it?! - yes...absolutely no, that's incorrect! I'll tell you this much: scum are those who took for themselves two packs of bedsheets ...and the idiots are those who voted for it - ladies and gentlemen, I thought we agreed to hold a concert - you can shove this concert up your ass! Please come in - gentlemen, I ask you to observe language that's parliament-worthy - oh, please... Hello. Excuse me, is Aleksandr home? Hello. He's not here. But he might be back soon. You may wait for him. Please take off your jacket and have a seat. My name is Olya. Pardon me, but who are you? You don't have to answer if you don't want to. Why not? My name is Nastya. I work as a clerk in an office supplies store. Is that the truth? Although, I am sorry I have no reason to not believe you. So let's entertain the idea that you're an office supplies clerk for now - why for now? - because... because with your physical attributes, you'll be a make-up artist in a month somewhere in America - Or in the worst case, in Israel. - I don't know. I am not planning to take my attributes anywhere. Well, everyone says they have no such plans. Forgive me my directness, Nastya... I don't know what relations you have with Sasha. He's my brother, a very good person whom I love... But believe me that despite all his good qualities, he is unworthy of you. because you... how should I say this?... What time is Sasha coming? Actually, after 6. But I thought, perhaps he'd drop in sooner. Yesterday, in one house, he left his cigarettes. I was asked to return them. - Bye. Why do you consider your brother unworthy of me? Because you are you, and he is he. Good afternoon. Girls! - Good afternoon - Howdy - Do you know how to read? We're closed... - Oh, Valya, who gave you a black eye? What the...?! Are you blind? Woman, can't you read the sign? Closed for lunch. Greetings to you from Nastya Plotnikova. I am her relative. I came to visit her from the city of Tver. Our dear Nastya? How is she doing? Taking care of her mom. Doing maintenance work. So I decided, I should replace her at work. for now. No, thanks. Your move... Thank you so much. Do excuse us, but we'll do our dear Nastya's work ourselves. Then I will go Say hi to Nastya Actually, I don't even know anyone in this city. It's bad when one has no acquaintances. If you want, you can come to Makhno metro station at 7pm My husband will be doing a performance there. It's a very prestigious show. Thank you, dear Katya! Your face looks very familiar. Where could I have seen you? You have to guess. - Yesterday... - At the dinosaurs? As you were jumping off the bridge. Do you remember? Hazily. ...And when you fell asleep at someone's house... Have you forgotten? Are you Nastya? Nastya Pardon me. Heh! Some mental lapses! Did your mom get upset with me? - On the contrary. She talked all night about how you're so calm and modest - Really? I don't remember very well. Do you remember what we talked about when you walked me home? Yes... in general terms... And how you set a date with me? Have you forgotten? You forgot. Of course I remember! Where, then? - You tell me where. I remember. - Metro station "Makhno" - At 7 - Right, Makhno at 7 Nastya, I am sorry, I landed a small job here. Hey, chief, be a pal, can u stop this machine? Nastya dear, take a look, which way fits me better? Up to here, or down to here? It was good like it was. No, why should I look like a relic? We have people visiting nowadays. Yeah, up to here. Mom, do you know how to tap-dance? Peace of cake! Oh, I am not supposed to. So, did you return the cigarettes? I did. Was he glad? He was. OK, come what may, I'm gonna trim it. Mom, do you think it's acceptable if I ask Teterin to hire Sasha as a driver? Of course it's acceptable. But how does it look? I barely met him and I'm already bugging him for favors... Oh, please. Does he have a drivers license? Yes, he does...probably. - Teterin speaking. - Vladimir Nikolaevich, hello again. - Margunin has stopped by. They want to install the toilet door for me. - Can you imagine? - Mom... They're simply tormenting me and you! I could punch a hole through this door with my bare finger. It's as thin as cardboard. - Punch through what? - The closet door - What door? Who is speaking? - It's Tonya Plotnikova? - What Tonya?... Who?! Nastya's mom. - Hello - Mom, say about Sasha - Oh, whatever. - I beg your pardon. Vladimir Nikolaevich, Nastya has given me an idea here... You know we have this one relative here, named Sasha So well-mannered, quiet, not a drunk. Can we give him a job as your driver? - Well why not? Of course. Tell him to come by today - Thank you. No problem. Tell me, is Nastya there? Could you give her the phone? Nastya? Yeah, sure. - It's for you - I'm not here - Alright, please send her my regards. - I will. Thank you, Vladimir Nikolaevich. - So you won't forget about that door? - I won't - OK, thanks, bye now. Mom, so what about Sasha? Also settled. You're taking Sasha and bringing him there with all his work papers. But tell him it's gotta be today. There's too many applicants for a gig like that. - I'm listening... - Hello, Olya, this is Nastya - Olya, did Sasha come home? - No I'll go ahead and hang myself And they will bury me [WESTERN ACCENT] Oh, you look fine... - Hello - Hello I am sorry for making an acquaintance on the street, but perhaps we will be dining together? - ...and making photographs? - Nah, we won't be. Then maybe we'll buy some brand-name clothes and you will be in my collection of Beautiful Russian Women? - No - I'll pay in dollars - Mister, want me to show you a trick? - I don't understand very well. - May I? - What for? A trick, look! OK? Let's run! [SINGING]...I'll go ahead and hang myself... - Woa! We ran away. - Olya, you're nuts. We should have ripped out his sideburns, that foreign pervert! - But where is your hat? - Oh no, it fell off back there. - Wait here - Forget it. Don't go, they'll beat you. Pardon me. But this hat already has an owner. Do pardon me. Hey, beauty, where are you off to? Stop, I am asking you nicely. But the hat is ours. Just try and come closer! Just try it. - I'll slam you so hard that you'll spend your hole life working off the hospital bills - Oh yeah?! - Say what?! - Have you no decency? Say what?! - We're not bother you... - Why, look at you... - ...and you leave us alone - ...and look at how you behave Come on, there's no one around. Nothing but trash here. - Hey, Crooky, hold this - Let's go. And how about the TV set? And what about the china? I'm bringing it You know, Nastya, until the age of 13, I was an Ugly Duckling - Where to? - We're to see Teterin But when I realized that someone could like me, I lost all interest in being that. What do you think of love, does it exist? - It probably does - Well, I can't fall in love. I want to... We're to see Teterin... and I cannot. - Why is that? - Perhaps you are overly demanding - What do you think of Shakespeare? - Shakespeare is an English writer. How do you interpret Hamlet's words: "One must be cruel only to be kind"? Excuse me for a second Pardon me, can you tell me where Mr. Teterin's office is? - It's over there - Thank you - Here's the documents, I'll wait for you here - But what if they ask me something.
