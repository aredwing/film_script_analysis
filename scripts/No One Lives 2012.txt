( Screaming ) ( grunting, sobbing ) ( screaming ) ( music playing on radio ) I don't know. It's just not gonna be the same. Trust me, it will be the same. I'm going to miss everyone. You saw everybody. Sometimes it's necessary to relocate. Don't make it seem like it's not your fault. Out of every bad situation comes something good. Don't you agree? You have a truly demented way of looking at things. If I didn't, I don't think you'd be so in love with me. ( Chuckles ) Don't flatter yourself. I'm tired. Let's stop somewhere for the night. ( Pings ) Hey now. Please don't tell me you're here for directions. I got 15 rooms, all with your name on 'em. Well, good news is, I know exactly where I'm going. The bad news is, I only need one room. Well, I'll take what I can get. I just need a credit card. Wow. Pretty, young- - Just the way I like 'em. - Yeah. Well, that's an unusual name. Yeah. My father had a unforgiving commitment to historical reference. Oh. Well, let's just get you fixed up, huh? How does number 8 sound to you? Infinity-- I like it. TV anchorman: ...Jet fighters bombed a guerilla base, killing at least 49 soldiers and 13 civilians. - Man: There it is again. - Anchor: Up next, local law enforcement and the FBI are scouring the area north of Spokane for any evidence that can lead them to missing heiress Emma Ward. Officer: From what we can tell, the carving's about six months old. It reads "Emma alive." It's impossible to get an accurate date, but tree growth on that particular alder indicate about a half a year, probably done in the spring, right around-- well, after her abduction. - Clever girl. - Anchor: Joining us now in the studio - is the former FBI investigator... - You think? Anchor: ...who has worked many similar cases. I don't think I would have thought to do that. Anchor: What are the FBI agents dealing with... Now she has a chance. - There's always a chance. - FBI agent: ...as much information... (TV off) But you know how these things turn out. Take off the towel. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. A man who lacks emotion is sorry. I don't lack emotion. I just process it differently. Must everything about you be different? I like normal. I would change if I could, but I can't. I just can't. Just tell me you don't love her more than me. I don't love her more than you. I never did. It was just different. ( Birds chirping ) ( rock music playing ) - Burly man: Put some muscle in it. - ( grunts ) Youth: That's easy for you to say. ( Burly man chuckles ) You gotta be kidding. Jack, can you do me a favor and go open the gate? Why? Why? Because the gate won't open. ( Chuckles ) I need you to open it, please. - ( Jack sighs ) - Thank you. ( Music continues ) Trouble! Trouble! Ho! ( Sighs ) Home sweet home. - Man: Who are these guys? - Woman: Honey. Mind my lead. Let me do the talking. Talking? Don't you think it's a little late for talking? Hand me-- give me the phone. - ( Woman screaming ) - Youth: What's he doing? - Youth: What is he doing? - Woman: Flynn, stop it! Woman: Flynn, what the fuck? What the fuck, man? Argh! Motherfucker. Woman: Enough! - Flynn: Damn it! - Ethan: Come on, man. Get up. Your problem, Flynn, is you don't fucking think. - He had a phone. - You have a phone. Should I shoot you? Every cop in the county heard that racket. You made a mess here, Flynn. Excuse me for saving our fucking asses. I mean, what did you think was gonna happen? That we'd just sit down and have a cup of tea with the Cleavers? Woman: You told us they were on vacation, Flynn. Flynn: Well, now they're on permanent vacation. - Woman: Fuck this. - This is so seriously fucked up. - Woman: Shit. - Is he fucking crying? - Are you fucking crying? - Youth: What did you do? Ethan, let's shut it down. Shut it down? Shut it down? - What about all the-? - He said shut it down. Like we were never here. Come on, let's go. I had to. I'm hungry- So go eat. And leave you here alone? Right. Why don't you go have dinner with your girlfriend? Would you be rational? I know what you were doing out there. You're wrong. (drill whirring) Hey, where do you suggest we eat tonight? Let's see, uh... go up here about 20 miles and take a right on Highway 21. There's a place called Helen's-- great food, delicious steaks. Great. Thanks. This old boy treating you well? All right, then. You kids enjoy yourself and I'll see you when you get back. Man: This is all about her, isn't it? Woman: Can you possibly imagine it being about anybody else? Man: Can we just enjoy a pleasant dinner? ( Door lock chirps ) Woman: Doesn't look like we'll have trouble finding a table. Man: Note to self-- "Do not order the fish." (woman chuckles ) Man: Aha. A sign of forgiveness? Woman: Don't get carried away. ( Man chuckles ) ( cowbell rattles ) ( music playing softly ) ( cowbell rattles ) Get yourself comfortable. Sit anywhere you like. It's awful quiet these months. Amber will be right with you. Amber, table! Hey there. I'm Amber. Today's fish is a terrific John Dory and the steak is an aged rib eye. Is it aged because no one orders it? Very funny. Why don't I start you off with something to drink? Wine. ( Cowbell rattles ) - Oh, shit. - Helen, a pitcher. ( Rock music playing faintly ) Flynn: Where's your sense of humor, Hoag? I just have to have my-- my fun. He's a total psychopath. I'm a team player. You, my friend, have become a fucking liability. And my fucking wallet is empty. Ethan's right. Today's on you. Figure out a way to make it right and maybe we will be friends again. Denny: True that. Are you-- are you mad at me also? Listen, if I have to take any shit from you today, I'm gonna turn your fucking ball sack into a beanie. - I'm just saying-- - Shut the fuck up. You can talk once you've put in your time. I have to take a leak. Don't tell me you're watching your weight. A girl's gotta keep her figure. You're crazy. Look who's talking. Hey, are you guys from around here? I think they're mutes. - I think they're fucking mutes. - Denny: God damn it. We're just passing through. I see. - Are you moving? - Relocating. Traveling with all your worldly belongings? This is my only worldly belonging. Is that right? How much is she worth to you? Please, we don't want any trouble. - Look, just forget it, okay? - Hey! If I wanted to hear from an asshole, I'd rip you a new one. All right? The way I see it, your girlfriend looks at me like I'm the unsavory type. Like I'm someone you don't even want to get to know. Uncouth, perhaps. Is that it? Don't. Yeah, don't. You're not the type. Trust me, I know the type. Don't mind my boy here. His idea of friendliness is to scare the tourists. ( Softly ) Boo. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Please excuse us. - Hoag: Move. - Whoa. ( Flynn chuckles, whistles ) Do not shit where I eat. ( Door closes, bell rattles ) ( music continues ) J' 'Cause death is my best friend. J' ( insects chirping ) ( music playing on radio ) Am I really your only worldly possession? Of all people, - you should know I need my-- - ( motorcycle engine revving ) ( tires screech ) ( bangs ) ( car approaching ) " ( Flynn groans) ' ( Hoag chuckling ) What in fuck's name is this? We can strip her down. There's parts in here. And where, pray tell, is the owner of this luxury vehicle? Convalescing at the gas station, after which Ethan will encourage him to cooperate. I told you, I don't like you getting my brother involved in your shit. This guy is some uppity rich motherfucker who was at the right place at the right time. All it's gonna take is just a little bit of torture and we'll have bank codes, pin numbers and all sorts of shit. Kidnapping tourists is your idea of fast cash? Did I not just make up for the short haul? Why don't you get off my fucking ass? Flynn, another fuckup like today, and I end you. Clear? ( Clanking, creaking ) ( door slams ) Where are we? Last place on earth. Oh... a comedian. This seem funny to you? Have they hurt you? What do you think? I've made a decision. (sobs) Please forgive me. Shh. No talking, sweetness. I can't do this anymore. Ethan: I said shut up. (whispers ) Betty, don't. It's been an experience. - ( Woman screams ) - What the fuck? Oh, "W" I'll see you in the next life. Don't. No! Ethan: What the fuck? ( Screaming ) Ethan: What the fuck? Get away from her. Hey. HEY- You're dead, fucker. Shit. (grunting ) - (coughs) - That's where you're mistaken. But this should clear up the confusion. ( Gasps ) Handcuffs- that was your first mistake. You people never heard of zip ties? ( Ethan whimpering ) - ( Emma grunting) - Come on. Can I get some fucking help here, please? It's too late for this fucking shit, Flynn. Fuck, what the fuck is that? This is a girl that I found in the fucking trunk. Fuck, she smells like a fucking toilet. - ( Emma grunting) - All right, all right, all right. Hold still, all right? I'm gonna take this off. You're gonna stand still. Easy, easy. Okay? - ( Screams ) - Come here. Did she bite me? - Tamara: Fuck. - ( screaming ) Flynn: Hey. Hey. HEY- - Flynn: Stop it. Stop it. - ( Emma screaming ) Denny: What the hell is all that yelling? There's a world of shit erupting downstairs. Flynn: Stop it. It's 2:30 in the morning. And there's some girl down there screaming like she's got bugs up in her. Don't bust my balls, Amber. Seems like Flynn carjacked that couple from the restaurant. - Cut the shit. - No, seriously. - I gotta check it out. - No, you ain't gotta do nothing. - No, I gotta go. I gotta go. - No. I gotta go. ( Emma screaming ) - No. No. No. - What the fuck is going on? Flynn found her in the trunk of the car. Where is he? Where is he? You killed him, right? Please tell me he's dead. Expand on "he." Oh, God. - What's going on? - We have to get out of here. - We-- we have to-- - What? Get Ethan on the radio, now. Now. Go. No, we have to leave now. We have to get out of here now. Why won't you let me go? What were you doing in the trunk of that car? Answer him. - Answer him. - ( grunts) He had to move. He knew they were coming, so he had to-- Tamara: Who the fuck are we talking about? Listen to me. He's gonna come for me. He always does. Why don't you start by telling us his name? He doesn't have a name. He's gonna come and he's gonna kill you all. Dad, Ethan is not coming up on the radio. Keep trying- You're not gonna get him. You're not gonna get him. He's-- he's already dead. How the fuck do you know? Shut the fuck up, Flynn! ( Emma panting ) Please just call the police. Are you people fucking retarded? Go up the road and wake Ethan the fuck up. I'm going with him. This Flynn show is getting under my skin. I'm sick of being disrespected. Denny, it's not a fucking book club. You earn your way around here. If you want respect, - you need to grow a pair. - Yeah, like Flynn? Flynn might be a scumbag, but he's a loyal soldier, and that means something. Well, I'm practically blood. Banging his little girl doesn't buy you rights. Makes you brave, though, considering every dick in town has been in that shit. This is my girlfriend you're talking about. God, Dens, please. Something's not right. Tamara: All right, let's go. ( Dripping echoes ) Denny: Ethan, are you in here? - ( Radio buzzing ) - What the fuck happened to the radio? Whoa! Oh, fuck. What the fuck? What the fuck? ( Screams ) Oh! Oh. How the fuck did he kill Ethan? - Mother of God. - Nobody kills Ethan. Tamara: What the hell happened here? Denny: Oh, fuck. This is so wrong. Flynn really fucked up bad, didn't he? Looks that way. - ( Denny retches ) - Fuck. Here, I think these should fit you. Hey! - What's gotten into you, girl? - Maybe we should let her clean up. Till we hear from Ethan, I'm not letting that one out of my sight. I already told you, he's dead. You don't know my brother. I never will. ( Both grunting ) Tamara: Push. ( Tamara coughs, panting ) What happened to you? What's your name? ( Door closes ) I have a question. Do you people have any idea what you're dealing with? Where the fuck is the girl? I told you not to let her out of your sight. You know how you guys always make fun of me for watching all those reality shows? Well, just wait till you see this. ( Theme music playing ) So it's mostly just pedophiles and bank robbers, guys who kill their families and shit, but I've been totally into this one story. Baby girl, don't be wasting my time. Amber: This one. That's you, right? It was like any other Friday night at the Oregon Arts Complex-- a night that would be seared into the minds of parents of 15 college students forever. Oregon student Emma Ward and her friends were having a party, celebrating the end of the semester like most students. Except this celebration turned bloody. A killer entered the house. Was he already there, waiting, or was he a friend? Police and federal authorities have never been able to place together the mystery of how or why it happened. But when it was over, 14 students had been brutally murdered. Only one was never found-- Emma Ward, the heiress to the Nashville-based Ward Publication empire. Did she know the killer? Until now, it was unclear. That's when hunter Richard Louie discovered this. I was tracking a deer when it got caught up in this thing. Officer: Apparently the carving is about eight months old. Lab tests prove that this is Emma Ward's blood on the glass. Now we must continue our investigation under the premise that she is out there somewhere. Narrator: The Ward family is offering a $2 million reward for any information leading to the recovery of their daughter. Up next, Kansas City authorities are still searching for a 20-month-old toddler after her sudden disappearance from her home three weeks ago. "American Crime"... - ( TV off ) - Jackpot. And the driver of the car...? Is the maniac who did all that. That bitch has "payday" written all across her face. Yeah, and a trail of heat from here to Oregon hunting for the motherfucker who kidnapped her. Hoag, we're not talking about some nickel-and-dime highway robbery bullshit. - ( Men speaking softly ) - Emma, you know we're only here to help you, right? Hoag: ...But this presents... - ( spits ) - ...complications. ( Hisses ) Tamara: Hoag? - A word. - Amber: Denny. Stay here. I want this motherfucker found. Denny: We searched for the guy. I think he hoofed it into the woods. Well, you didn't look hard enough. Flynn: At least we know he's not gonna go to the cops. Hoag: The man who did this doesn't forget the man who crossed him, and neither do I. Get Ethan out of here. Put him in the shed. We are gonna clean this mess up. ( M utters ) Denny: Why are we the ones moving him all over this fucking country? We should bury him proper. Flynn: I ain't digging that hole. ( Denny grunts ) Jesus. That should keep the flies off him. Now go clean up the back of the van. That's bullshit. I picked him up. I told you. You should have listened to me. I need to know exactly what we're dealing with. Where's the girl-- Betty? Dead. I guess he was done with her. What? No, he would never do that, not to her. You-- you guys fucked up. You really fucked up. Am I right in guessing your friend will be heading our way? I am asking you a question. - ( Bones crack) - ( grunting ) Stop her! Stop. Stop" or it will be your brains running down those stairs. Then you'd better get yourself a mop. (cocks gun ) Oh, that's fine. My best hope of escape is while he's killing the whole bunch of you. So I'll just wait. (whirrs) ( beeps ) ( blade rings ) You're telling me that chick is worth $2 million? Yep. Denny, stop fucking counting the cash. Start loading the guns. Watch this bitch. If she moves, waste her. Tamara, after we take off, lock this place down. Shoot anything that comes through the door. Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean, we? This prick is not gonna find himself now, is he? Well, shouldn't one of us hang back and protect the girls? Nobody's hanging back. We're hunting this motherfucker and we are gonna burn him down. Denny: What, as-- as on fire? Flynn: It's a figure of speech, you idiot. Hoag: Come on! I want this motherfucker dead. Argh! (groaning ) Hoag! ( Screaming ) Motherfucker. Tamara: Fuck. Shit. ( Gunfire popping ) - Tamara: You see him? - Where the fuck are you? Come out and fight like a man, bitch. Tamara: Get back in! Fuck. I'm fucking shot. - Denny. - Am I fucking dying? - Denny. - Am I dying? - Fuck me. I can't believe it. - Where's Hoag? - Gone. - Gone? What does he mean, gone? - He's gone. He's gone. He got him. - ( Amber sobbing ) ( Denny sobbing ) Fucking Flynn, give me some fucking help here. - Denny: Am I fucking dying? - Tamara: Get up, get up. ( All chattering ) Tamara: We're losing a ton of blood here. Get him to the couch. Where's my dad? - Denny: I don't know. I don't know. - Flynn: Let me look at it. - Denny: There's a lot of blood. - Let me look at it! It's just a flesh wound, all right, man? You're gonna be all right. You're not going back out there. I'm not leaving without Hoag. Hoag is history. Fuck you, Flynn. He wouldn't leave without you. In case you haven't noticed, he's everywhere. So if you want to take your sweet tits and get shot off, be my guest! (coughing ) Motherfucker. What's he doing? He's trapping us. If you hadn't killed all those fucking people... Killed what people? - Killed what people? - None that concern you! Flynn, you might want to drop the bad guy routine. I'm your path to living, and you seem to be bent on playing the dying game. Well then, we're gonna die together, bitch. (machine whirring ) ( metal clanging ) (groaning ) So, what are you, the leader here? You are playing this all wrong. My people are gonna find you and they're gonna fucking kill you. Man: Who knows? You might all be heroes. Well, not you. (grunting ) ( screams ) You motherfucking cocksucker. Fuck. You must be satisfied to go from leader to martyr. Any thoughts? ( Screams ) Hello? (whimpering ) I can get the girl for you. I can get the girl for you. You can go on your way. No. No. You see, I'm planning on handling that little task on my own. I thought you were gonna help me get things back to the way they were. Can you do that-- turn back time? - Hoag: No. - Man: No. You know what I hate about the common criminal? They're so mediocre. Please, what the fuck are you talking about? Man: It's in mendacity that we achieve our very best. Is this your best? Fuck you. Man: Because I am not even close. - Let me up. Let me up. - You know who I am? Man: Who am I? Who... am I? Hoag: I don't know. A serial killer? Man: A serial killer? Sweet Jesus, no. Serial killers deal in singularities. I'm a numbers guy, which makes me a total psychopath. Admittedly, there are a few things that might stereotype me-- fixations, rituals, trophies. Case in point. But what really motivates me is the absolute need to get the job done. How many are in the house? Do your math, quick. Five. There's five. Including my Emma? Oh, you're under the impression she's one of you, huh? ( Chuckles ) Okay, you've served your purpose. Any last words? Pity. Concise, not terribly clever, but the clarity of the intention-- crystal clear. However, no. - No, please. - ( thumping ) ( Hoag grunting, screaming ) I bet you want to kill the man who did this to you. Your powers of perception are staggering. Why you? I guess you could say he loves me. Today we're gonna advance to something much more challenging. Let's meditate for a moment on the power you have over living things. The only thing keeping you in here is me. Anything happens to me, and you die. Fun fact-- there are documented cases in which prisoners found in cages long after their captors surrendered, left to their own, final, desperate measures, actually cannibalized themselves. You know what the technical term for that is? Please stop. Sarcophagy- Emma, listen to me carefully. When the arterial vein is sliced, the body tends to bleed out within 10 minutes. It's not like in the movies when someone's jugular is severed and they immediately drop dead. No. But it's also impossible for the victim to administer the proper medical help. Do you know what that is? No. No biggie. I'm not a doctor either. I can tell you this much, though-- you elevate the wound above the heart and you apply pressure to the area. And you bandage tightly. That's very important. ( Gasps, sobs ) Why are you telling me this? Because no matter how much you hate me, you now have the opportunity to save my life. ( Screams ) What's gonna happen to my dad? You and your dad-- you didn't get along. He wasn't the best role model. He's going to be tortured and killed. Hmm. Why didn't he kill you? I think he was trying to create me. What did he do to you? Would he hurt you? You should have run while you had the chance. All right, Dens, here, swallow this. I don't want to die. Just swallow this. It will take the edge off, all right? All right. Good boy, good boy. All right. No one's dying on my watch, all right? ( Denny sobs ) (coughs) - Oh. - Tamara: All right, fine. We need to get him some real help here. Good idea. I'll call an ambulance. Let me get right on that. What about the Jeep? Unless he got into the garage. It's been broken down for a fucking year. Dad is dead. Ethan is dead. Denny's not doing so hot. I'm looking at your ugly asses and guess what I'm thinking. I'm thinking fucking dead! You know what? No one's ever given a shit what you think. Listen, bitch, just because my old man was giving you the deep dicking doesn't make you my mother. And with him dead, that pretty much makes this my fucking house. So why don't you shut the fuck up or get the fuck out? Fuck! - Denny: Oh, God. - Hello. - Aggh! - Come on, bitch. Hey, enough. - Enough. - ( thumps) Someone's at the door. (thumps) ( thumping continues ) Want to go take a peek? You go take a peek. ( Thumping stops ) You gigantic pussies. I'll look. Tamara: Is it Hoag? - No, it's a bag. - Flynn: What kind of bag? I don't know. Just a bag. Move. No! Do not open that door. Whatever's in the bag is bad. Just get the fuck out of my way. That's my dad's ring. Is that blood? Fucking hell. Just close the fucking door! Enough, motherfucker! Come on, bring it! (women screaming ) Oh, fuck. Denny, I have to get out of here right now. I can get the Jeep going. What, are you fucking crazy? If I don't make a move right now, I'm not gonna last long. You know it. I know it. I can get that Jeep going. And I'll get us the fuck out of here. Gun. Okay, Den. You realize he's probably got the whole place rigged, right? You ready? ( Faintly ) I love you. Here. ( Amber sobbing ) Denny: Let's go. Amber: Fuck. Emma: You shouldn't have let them go. What's it to you? Well, 'cause when they're dead, five becomes three. And last I checked, there's strength in numbers. Here. Stay here. Okay. - Denny: Get in. - Okay. Hey, I love you. I love you too. - Amber: Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Come on, baby. - Come on. - ( engine starts ) - Ah. - Come on. Yes, yes, yes, yes- ( engine knocking ) Fuck. ( Engine stops ) Oh, don't, don't, don't. Where are you going? - I'm gonna fix it. - No, no, no. - I'm gonna fix it. - Don't leave me. Don't worry. (Amber whimpering ) Hurry, baby- Amber: Fuck. Okay, come on. Fuck.Fuck. Fuck. - (Yelps) - Quiet, I'm gonna try a few things. When I knock on the hood, you give the ignition a twist, all right? - Okay? - Okay, This will only take a second, okay? Okay. Honey, be careful. ( Knocks ) - ( engine sputters ) - Oh, fuck. Denny, come on, please. - ( Knocks ) - ( engine starts ) - Got it! - ( gasps ) Yes. Yes, it's working. It's running fine. Get in the car. Really lay down on it. Denny, Denny, it's running fine. Please get in the fucking car. (grunting ) It's fine. Get in the fucking car, please. (engine grinding) Oh, fuck! Oh, my God! ( Screams ) ( screams ) ( screaming ) Flynn: We need to go right now. When I say run, we run. Where the fuck are we supposed to go? Did you fucking hear that? That was Amber running in the woods. We need to go right fucking now. Let's move. ( Screaming ) (grunts) Oh, my God. Denny, Denny. - Tamara, he's dead. - Come on, Denny. - Tamara, he's dead. Get in the car. - ( sobbing ) Tamara: Fuck. At least you died trying, kid. (coughing ) Jesus. (gagging ) Jesus. Just a second. ( Denny gagging ) Oh, my God, he's alive, you fucking asshole. - Look at him. Look at him. - He's alive. You fucking asshole, - get the fuck off him. - Look at him. - You think we're doing him a favor? - Get him in the goddamn fucking car! (Amber gagging ) Why are you doing this? It keeps me fit. But I didn't do anything wrong. Then I guess you're just unlucky. ( Radio beeps ) ( gasping ) Fucking ain't worth it. Jackpot Seems like I've just saved our lives. How 'bout some thanks? Yeah, I'm sure Denny is super thankful. ( Tires screech ) Why don't you turn your lights on, trigger-happy? Who said I was asking for your opinion? Well, we've come this far. It would be nice to actually live. - ( Screams ) - Oh! Fuck. You just killed the one person who actually had a soul. Yeah, well, what does that make you? Make sure she doesn't get any ideas. You got any ideas? Come on, Denny. Looks like you may be the lucky one, bro. ( Honks horn ) - ( rock music playing ) - Man: You see it? You see it? The moon's really big. It's like-- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. ( Chuckles ) Hey. Hey, dude, did you get in an accident or something? Exactly-- something. I mean, do you need a ride? This day just keeps getting better and better. Have you come up with a plan yet, genius? I need to think. ( Door squeaks ) ( Pings ) - Well, hello there. - Evening. Please don't tell me you're here for directions. I've got 15 rooms, all with your name on 'em. Just one, thanks. - Are you solo? - Are we playing 20-fucking-Questions? How about number 3? That's fine. All I need is a credit card. Of course. Interesting name. Isn't it? Park anywhere you like. You have a good night. Hello, Sheriff. This is Harris. Flynn: We're driving down the lovely country road, just you and me. If they connect the dots, we're dead ducks. So Hoag and all that shit never fucking happened. Oh, the wheels of genius are spinning. And you, little missy... You're gonna nod your head like a good little girl. So we're driving and, holy shit, we see a girl crawling out of the woods all fucked up. We throw her inside and we realize we got us Emma fucking Ward. Payday- You're my payday- So all we have to do now... is kick up our dogs, relax, freshen up. Come first thing, I'm taking you to Nashville. Nashville? You're taking me home? You didn't think that I'd just hand you in to some backcountry Johnny Law, did you? No. I'm gonna take you straight to your daddy. Because I want to get paid. But I think you're worth more than $2 million. I think you're worth at least five. What do you think? Come here. Attagirl. Attagirl. I have to pee. I'll be right here. ( Water splattering ) The gun's right there. Why now? 'Cause you won't make it home alive if you don't. So you'd kill him. You hate him enough. I don't want to find out that I can't. You're different. Maybe I should just kill you both. All right, then. I'll blow his fucking head off. ( Knocks on door) What the fuck's going on in here? You guys having a fucking sewing circle? I told you I will cooperate. You'd say anything, wouldn't you? I bet when that psycho had you tied up under his bed, you'd say all sorts of pretty little lies, wouldn't you? You saved my life, Emma. I saved you to save myself, nothing more. Did you search me for a key, for a way out? There was no key. Because there was no lock. Don't lie to me, Emma. You had a choice. You chose me. ( Door slams ) You don't lie to him, not if you want to stay alive. Well, I'm not afraid of him. County sheriff. Shit. Get up. County sheriff. Open up, please. Don't say a fucking word. - Evening, Officer. - Evening. We have a problem. It seems we have a case of identity confusion. The hotel manager recalls someone checking in earlier using the same name, the same credit card. Now if I could just check your identification, we could clear all this up. ( Tamara gagging ) (gunshot) Let's go. Tamara, get out here. Shit. He's here. ( Gasps ) - ( gunshot) - Fuck. Fuck! Hey. HEY! Turn around. Where do you think you're going?
