Is she moving in there? Hello? Amy, are you up? It's almost noon. So I ordered these big Wanguni lips- the sculptor- three months ago for the new room. It's a glass sculpture by Bob Wanguni. These giant lips- He's known for his lips, Wanguni. So today I get a call- it's gonna take another 10 weeks for them to get here. Ah. So we're having a dinner... for a possible client and his wife. Okay. They're staying here for the summer, with their son. - Mmm. - And, um... I'm not saying you-you can't come. - What are you not saying? - Well, I'm not not saying anything. I'm saying, of course, you can come. You're living here. - I'm staying here. - Well, at some point... I don't know what the difference is, hmm? Look, honey, I need you to... shape up a little. - What? - I need you to get something nice to wear. Oh, Mom, I'm- Look, I have offered to take you shopping many times. I cannot have you walking around at this dinner party in the same shabby T-shirt. Come on. I need you to make an effort. I just don't really feel like going shopping right now. Do you think that Daddy feels like wining and dining... some New York lawyer at his age? I'm just kind of having a hard time at the moment, Mom. I know. Look, I-l talked to Phyllis Nagel. You know jennifer. Jennifer's really having a hard time too. Her new, uh- second novel... is being published by some dinky press. She's very distraught. So she's taking something for it. Some... antidepressant or something. Just to help her with the difficult transition. Amy, you haven't left the house in three months. It's so good to see you out of the house, Amy. Caley is gonna be so excited. She insisted that you come. - Hmm. - Did she? Oh, Aims, I-l ran into, um... Monica Cohen,jessica's mom. She told me that Jessica is taking a yoga teacher training. I thought that might be something you could do. - Huh? - I don't even take yoga, Mom. Well, you could try. You know, uh, Noah and Missy... are gonna want you to babysit for them. - Pull over. - What? - Oh, God. - Oh, God. - Hi. - Hey. Get a bucket. - Huh? - Some water, ammonia, some rags. Oh, God. It's awful. Where's Amy? It's totally genetic. Noah always gets carsick when I drive. Hear about this big client we're trying to get, Amy? I told her she has to get something to wear for the dinner. She knows, Mom. She's done a thousand of these things for David. - Noah. - What? What, I can't even say his name? Hi. - Oh, there she is! - Hi. Ooh, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you, get you, get you. - Don't get me, Granny! - I'm gonna get you! Amy, seriously. You gotta snap out of this thing for the party. Look, if the office gets this client, Dad gets to retire. He's gotta retire, Amy. I am suffocating. Just get something nice to wear, okay? Something to wear. - Hey, Amy. - Hey, Gary. Your mom said to tell you that she took the Infinity to work out. Fuck. - Can I help you? - Oh. Yeah. I just need a new T-shirt. We've got some new super soft Pima cottons in today. Okay. Thanks. Shit. Oh. - Can you just take the shirt off? - Sure. I'm- Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I mean- I'm not stealing it. Hey, Karen. It's Amy Minsky. Oh. We, um, went to West Farms together. I took the yearbook pictures of the soccer team when you were cocaptain. Oh, yeah. Did you have glasses then? Yeah. And were you- Bigger. - That was you? - Yeah. Oh, I can't believe it. - Look at me. - Oh, wow. Can you believe it? And I already have two kids. - I'm like, Scotty, get off." - Mmm. - Do you have kids? - No, I don't. No. Wow. It changes everything. Mmm. So, are you married? Um- Well, I got divorced a few months ago. That's so sad. Who was he? He-l mean, he's not dead. - Oh. -just, like- - We're still friends and- - That's awesome. If only it were true. Hey, a bunch of us still go out to Viva's on Thursday night and get drunk. You should come. Girls' night. Amy! Honey, are you- Oh. Come on. How can it just be stress? What does she do all day long? I-I-I don't see where this is going, Stan. She made a big mistake, not taking alimony from David. No, no, no. She felt humiliated. She didn't want to take from him, and I can take care of her. Oh. Oh, yeah. What if we can't stay in this house? Are we all gonna move in somewhere together? - Well, she doesn't need him. - Well, she sure needs something. She left all of her stuff there like a crazy person. I don't-l don't know where this comes- She's uneducated, unmotivated- She's not uneducated. Well, that liberal arts degree with that phony master's- Where's that going to get her? Yeah? You know she doesn't mean it. I just wish I didn't agree with her. Oh, come on. You just had some bad luck. You know I'm not good at talking about things. You know- What can you do? That's all I know how to say. But it's kind of true too. Thanks, Dad. It's his loss. Eh.just, you know, stick to the- - What can you do?" - Yeah. Remember when we used to... stay up late and watch all those Mam Brothers movies together? Huh? When you were little? And you could never get up for school the next day. Your mom would get so mad at me. Oh, my God. What- What are the, um, clients? - What's the company you're trying to get? - Oh. Yeah. Th-That's, um- That's a big online thing that's about to go public. You know, if we get this client... we could make back some of the money we lost in the market. I mean, we could keep the house and- Well, I could actually retire. Like we planned. Your mother wants to take this trip around the world this fail. Gallivanting the Globe" it's called. Oh, uh, the trip has a name? All the best ones do. Apparently. Look... would you just... get a nice dress or something, for Chrissakes? Yes, I know. I- Mm-hmm. Look, here. Oh. No, Dad. I'll just borrow something. Please. Then- Then just keep it. Okay? - Whose happiness are you buying? - Mine. Then I'll take it. Take whatever you want. - Thanks, Missy. - Yeah. Um- Hey, can I try this one? Go for it, Aim. Fuck. Oh, it's a great house. How long have you been here? - Well, we've been here about five years. - Uh-huh. And we're going room by room. It's such a mess. And the people before- it's as if they had no idea they were on the water. There was no use of the views. And it was supposed to be finished last week, of course. Of course. I mean, sometimes I think- Aren't contractors aware... that everybody is talking about them in this way? Doesn't it bother them? - And does it bother you the way they talk about lawyers, Stan? - Oh. Ah. Amy, what do you do? Um, not much. No. I mean, um- Originally, a long, long time ago, um, I was a lit major. And then I went to grad school for photography. - Hmm. - So-- I was just trying to see how many things I could major in... that would never make me any money. Are you familiar with the work of Robert Mapplethorpe? Yeah, I am.Yeah. Well, uh, Jeremy here is an actor... and he recently played Mapplethorpe in a play. Oh, for heaven's sakes. Oh, that's a good segue. - Well- - That's impressive. But Jeremy, of course, got to know his work very well and he loved it. But I just find it so unsettling. What do you think, Amy? Um, yeah, some of the images are shocking. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But I think because he gives the shocking images the same attention as- as he does his- his owers... you know, that the shocking images become really kind of... beautiful. Yeah. I don't know. I think he's a master, really. Honestly. Amy would have made a great lawyer. I've always told her that. Well, I make a pretty good lawyer, right? Right? - Pretty good. - Oh! - More red? - Yeah, thank you. - It's good for you. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, the antioxidants, right? Uh-huh. - That's right. Well, you know, all those studies come from the wine companies though. - Oh, no. - That can't be true, Amy. That would be illegal, right? Otherwise, companies would just go around making unsubstantiated claims. - Isn't that right, Stan? - You bet. I read that too. - Yeah? - I did. Jeremy, would we have seen you in anything else, acting-wise? He was in a TV show for a long time. - It was for kids. - Ooh. Uh, it was called in the Garden, I knew it. You are Mr. Green! Oh, you know, Caley watches that show. Yeah? - That's you, right? - Oh, yeah! -I love it! - Yes. Do you ever do any Broadway musicals? - He's far too serious. - You have such a good voice. - I wish he would though. - Thank you. Truth be told, I was actually an actress. Really? Oh, I know. Hard to believe. I had to give it up though when, uh, Jeremy's dad and I divorced. It was just too difficult. I had to get a real job. Thank goodness for Jeremy. Otherwise I would have- I don't know- killed myself. Jeremy, is everything okay with your food? - Jeremy's a vegan. - Ah! - Oh, no. - Lord, I should have asked. I'm so sorry. - It is such a pain in the ass. Honestly. - It's okay. Well, Amy will eat anything you put in front of her... although she'll starve herself for dessert, right? Especially chocolates, right, Aim? When she was a little girl, I used to have to hide the chocolate... 'cause she would eat it all. I'm sorry. l just- - She's been having sort- sort of a rough time recently. - She's going through a divorce. Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. I was going on and on- Oh, it's all right. It's all right. Does she have any kids? There was a miscarriage. You. Hi. Hey- I like-l like your dress. It's my sister-in-law's dress. - Yeah. - Mmm. Jeremy? Are you in there? What are you doing? It's so dark. Are you okay? - I'm just- - What, honey? I don't know. I feel a little anxious. Oh, my God, it's me. I shouldn't have mentioned that show. I'm so proud of you, it gives me Tourette's. - No, no. It's okay. - Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. - Honey, you feel really warm. - No, it's okay. Come on, let's go get you water. - Hey, Larry, thank you so much for coming - It was so nice. Oh, no, no, no. Thank you. This- This was great. Oh, thank you. It was lovely. And thank you for including the whole family. Look, we're family people. We haven't spent a summer in Westport since Jeremy was 14. Well, you know, uh, Noah and Amy... could give Jeremy some pointers on some of the new hot spots for young people. - Yes. - Uh, except we're not young anymore. - Oh, stop. - You're younger than we are. That's not saying much, Stan. Good night. - Good night. So long. - Amy - It was lovely to meet you. - Oh. - I feel terrible about what I said before. - Oh. Listen, if you need to talk to someone about your divorce or anything,just give me a call. - I've been there. - You call us anytime, all right? - Of course. Good night. - Good night. Ah, you're up early. Am? - What a great night, huh? - Let's hope it helps. It'll help. Wasn't it a great night, Aim? - Uh-huh. - Nice people. Are you working on Saturday? Yeah. I have to go in. Gwen Hammer called this morning, Amy. - Who? - The woman who was here last night. - Jeremy Hammer's mother. Larry's wife. - Oh, yeah. She wants to know if you'll show Jeremy around town. - Wh-What's there to show? - I don't know, Amy. - She asked, so- - I think it sounds like a great idea. See you later. Bye. So? So? I need to know what to say to Gwen Hammer. Will you show Jeremy Hammer around? Hi. Sweet ride. Thanks. So, this is the quaint Main Street. It's pretty quaint. Well, it's very quaint. It's very quaint. There's a quaint little inn so that, uh, people from the city... can experience quaintness... for $500 a night. You're divorced? Uh- I am. What's that like? Which-Which thing? Being married or being- Um, I- I-I don't know. I- I-l loved being married. I was happy- I guess my husband wasn't. I had the- Rug pulled out from under me. Or the wool pulled over my eyes, or one of those. I had the- Maybe I had the rug pulled over my eyes. My God, I don't know why I'm telling you this. I'm sorry. I asked. I'm interested. And- And so you- you did photography? Yeah. Mm-hmm. I mean, like, a long time ago. What were your pictures of? Rivers. Water. Mostly rivers. Mmm. I was- I was going to do this, uh, thing. Like a collection of my work or whatever. You know, it was kind of like a thesis. It was gonna be like my thesis, but I did not finish it. Why not? Well, I met David, and we got engaged and- He was this big, like, celebrity, like, entertainment lawyer... so we had to have all these parties all the time for his clients, and- We bought a place. We had to redo the kitchen. Do you want to go to the beach? Amy? Okay. Well, good luck this summer. Can I see you again? Mmm, no. I mean- I think this was a bit, uh, crazy. No. Mm-mmm. Just - Please? - Please. Really, Please? What? My mother raised me to be polite. She didn't do a very good job. - I'm just really busy. - Busy? Yep. I'm busy. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, I cannot hear. Will you please come over near? Will you please look in my ear? There must be something there, dear.' Say, look. A bird was in your ear. But he is out, so have no fear. Again your ear can hear, my dear. Says the other character, right? Sol have to have other voices. Right? Hey Are you there? Do you wanna come over tomorrow? Mmm. Don't worry. There's nobody here. Just, um- ls there a more private place we can... be? Okay. All right, don't freak out. I haven't been in this room since I was 12. - Oh, my God. - What? This was a mistake. Oh, my God. Why? Look, you are a lot younger than me, in- in case you haven't noticed. I've been with older women before, okay? - You have? - Yeah. Really? Who? My on-set tutor, Mrs. Botstein. Mmm. This just- It... can't be, like, a thing. - A what? - Do- Like a- Like a, you know. Like- - What, a shell game? - No. My dad is trying to get these clients from your stepdad- I have no relationship with that guy. Okay, but I have a relationship with my dad. And it happens to be, like... the only good relationship in my life, so- Well, nobody has to know. I don't lie to my parents, okay? I don't sneak around. Gwen Hammer called, Amy, to thank you for showing Jeremy around. - She said he had a really good time. - Of course he did. He's playing Walt Whitman in a play in New York this fall. Apparently he's very ta/er/ted Really, I, frankly-l think she goes a little over the top, you know? Like he's God's gift. - Sounds like you two bonded. - No, I wouldn't go that far. I mean, she likes to talk. She's very open. She's a therapist. You know how they are. - Yeah, she said she's worried about him blowing his career. - Yeah. She says she's always worried about him... because he's gay and everything. - Mmm. - Apparently it's very hard for gay teenagers. Amy. Stan! Heimlich! Amy? What is so funny? Oh, stop. Dad. What? You're awake? I'm always awake. What is it? Um, j-- Just... I have to go out. I have to go to the drugstore. There's Motrin and Aleve in the top drawer, above the hair dryers. No. Um... I-it's a prescription. I forgot it, to pick it up. What for? I'm starting some meds. You, uh- You know, for- for my depression. - Oh. - Yeah. So when you hear the garage door and the- the ding-ding thing of the gate sensor... that's what it'll be. It's me... going out to pick up my antidepressants. I guess I was just... really good... at playing gay- - You know? - Hmm. I guess I was just really convincing. You know, like, it was just a gay part in a gay play, but. She- she just latched onto the idea, like a- like a pit bull, and she just wouldn't let it go. Oh, God. And- I had to take all my clothes off in the play. All my clothes off. And she brought all these people to come and see it. And they all sat in the front row. I saw them, they saw me. So embarrassing. But she just had this huge smile on her face and- She was just- She was, like, clapping so loudly. She's like the loudest clapper. But, I don't know. I've never seen her that happy. She's really into being accepting, so... I just let her think I'm gay. And she gets to be accepting. Yeah, sometimes it's just easier, you know,just to be... like what other people want you to be... rather than fight it. You know? You ever feel like that? What about your ex-husband? Why did you guys split up? Um- Well... he had an affair... with a woman from his work. Mmm. I thought she was my friend. They planned this, like, surprise party for me, together. - Wow. - Yeah. Surprise. It was surprising. Why did he do that? I mean, I-l assumed he was in love with her. I don't know. I- You know, I fucked up somehow... and he wanted a divorce, so- Well, I think he fucked up. - So why can't you stay out? - I just-l don't wanna get in trouble. I'll get in so much trouble. I can't. I wanna see you. You know? I want to see you come. Yeah? You know? What the fuck? I want to be able to walk in and, click- all the lights go on at once. You know? I'm supposed to be learning my lines for this Walt Whitman play. Nobody's following us. Ah! Thanks for taking me to work out. Well, getting fat doesn't do anybody any good. - Can I quote you on that? - You joke... but when I went to my Radcliffe reunion, everybody was fat but me. Boy, those antidepressants are getting you out of the house, huh? That's good. So, uh, think you're coming up with a plan for yourself now? I already feel like I'm really stoned. I used to have to smoke pot for so long to get stoned. Back in ye olden days. That's when I saw U2 at Nassau Coliseum, dude. Oh, shit. I'm supposed to do this play. You know? I got such a big part in this play. That's soon, I think, yeah? Ooh. Oh. - What? - Ooh. - I hate smoking pot. - Oh. I do too. I don't want to do it. Should we stop? Let's just stop. I don't want to do the play. Oh, my God. I do not want to do this play, Amy. I don't want to play Walt Whitman. l just- I... hate... acting. - You do? - I do. I do. I fucking hate it. - Jeremy- - I hate it. You're, like- You're standing up there... and then people are clapping for you. People are telling you what to say, where to go and where to stand. And then they say, Good job... like-like-like- like I'm like a fucking toddler who just learned how to use the toilet. So why? Why do you do it? I don't know. I don't know. Don't do it. Really? Just don't do it if you don't want to do it. It's your life, right? It's nobody else's. Hello, miss. What can I get you for your supper? Hello. My- My name is Leonardo. - Let me enter the castle, please. - You are not Leonardo. I'm just a sad princess, and I need to come in. - Please, oh. - You're not a princess. - You're Auntie Amy. - Ooh. It's a very specific kind of rose in your cheeks. Maybe it's the antidepressants. - Uh. - What? Mom told me. I think it's great for you. It's not for me, personally, taking a pill every time I have a problem. All right. No, it's not that. You just look-l don't know- sexy, is all. Are you seeing someone? What? No. - How could I be seeing someone? - Hmm. Mom said she thought you might be. Well- She said she's been hearing the gate sensors go off at night. Uh, mm-mmm. Well, if you're not, you should be. We know this guy who's friends with Craig Mankewitz. - Oh. - Not Craig Mankewitz. - Mmm. - His name is Phil Bauer. - He's in my rotisserie baseball league. - He's divorced. He has one kid. He's an investment banker in New York, but he lives here now. Your family would go crazy over him. - I already told your mom. - Oh. You got the shovel, the ax and the pick? Where's the pick? No. That's a-no pick. That's a hog. A hog, Don't you know what a hog is ? Oh, come on, let's get going. We gotta kidnap a couple of football players. Hey- I feel pretty stupid trying to write a novel. Because my dad's a writer. And... it just feels like... I'm trying to be like him or something. Now, what about you? I mean, like, what do you really wanna do? Stop it. Stop it. Why don't we go away together? Okay. No, I'm serious. I mean, I still have money from the show. You can take pictures. I can write. Mmm. Okay. - Okay. Go away. Where do you wanna go? - Yeah? Where should we go? Paris? Mmm. Is that clich? Mmm, it's Paris. Okay. How about somewhere un-cliche? Poland. Poland. - No? - Um-- L- Liechtenstein. - Canada. How about Canada? - Oh. Exotic Canada. Uh, Saskatchewan? Uh-- The wilds of Manitoba. We'll be Canadian. Are you ready for me? O-- Uh, okay. No, I got it. Oh! Hi! Uh... there was an understudy... for Patti LuPone, so we decided not to stay. - Oh. - We wanted to see Patti. Okay. Thank you. I'm- You- I'm gonna let you guys go. I mean, myself go- I will be going. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck. Fuck! Good evening. Oh, you scared me. Where were you tonight? - I-- - Ah, it's none of my business. Hey- Gee, I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks. Mom says you're taking antidepressants. God, it's tough to be a parent. You just want so much for your kids, and you just can't- lf we get these cases, it can really happen. We can stay in this house, finish the renovations, get your mom a new car. And I could... retire. Take this trip with your mother. It would mean so much to both of us. But the one thing, you know... a father wants to feel that his kids are all set when he retires... you know? Secure, married. With a house. A family of your own. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm sorry. I know it's late. It's going Okay- Oh, I do? That's good. Um, I don't-l don't know why I called exactly. I- Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know I have to sign the papers, David. They're good. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. They miss you too. Yeah. Yes. Um- No. Do you really want me to say that? Okay. I mean, no. No, they don't hate you. No, the opposite. It's- Okay. Hey- - What? - Come here. What? Huh? You shouldn't have come here, okay? - I'm so- We- - Somebody could fucking see you! You just ran off. What do you want me to do? - What did you say to her? - Nothing. I just- I just left. I just got my bike and I just went riding around. Well, you need to go home and tell her something. What would you want me to say? Jeremy, I don't fucking care what you say. Tell her some guy broke up with you and I came over to help you pick up the pieces. Yeah, and what? And then you just took your clothes off? Jeremy! Tell her anything, okay? Tell-Tell her I'm doing some fucking howling at the moon... primal-scream divorce therapy! But you were singing O Canada, Amy. - Oh! - Amy, I don't- Why- Why can't I just tell her the truth? If she says something to your stepdad, it could ruin my dad's retirement, okay? I could fucking ruin everything for him. Oh, God! It's like- It's like you're more of a coward than I am, you know? And you're supposed to be the adult in this relationship. We're not in a relationship. This whole thing, it just got out of hand, okay? I didn't mean for it to. It just- lt just happened, and we both just went crazy. I'm-l'm sorry. You just- You just do whatever they want you to do. And it is so pathetic. You- You don't even know what the fuck you're talking about. I mean, it's like you think you're so mature... and so savvy, and you-you're just not... because you don't know a fucking thing about the real world. There is no difference between me and you, Amy. Yeah, there is,jeremy. Because you're fucking 19 years old. Okay? I was married to a man, and I was in love with him. I had a fucking life, and I was happy in it. Do I have to spell this out for you? You and I can't be in a relationship, okay? - Okay - Okay? - Okay! - It's ridiculous. I mean, what the fuck do you think? Do you think we're gonna go off somewhere and wear fucking sarongs? - All right. - And visit with holy men and smoke opium. Oh, forget it. Okay. I don't even know what you think is gonna happen. Amy, won't you at least go out with him once? He lives in Westport. He has a big house here. Now you know, if Daddy doesn't get this client... we'll all be out on the street. Hmm. Hmm. I think I will have the ahi tuna steak. No, I had tuna for lunch. Shoot. Can't have tuna for every meal, or I'll turn into a thermometer. What? It's a joke. It's stupid. - I was just-'Cause all the mercury in- - Oh. The oceans, in the fish. Of course. Yeah. No, I know. Isn't it a shame? Yeah. You know, I look at my- my daughter Sarah, she's eight... and I, uh, think what are we doing to our oceans, you know? When fish, the most healthy thing- lt's just- Because l love it. I could have it every meal. Just, like, fish. Hmm. Love it, love it, love it, love it. Salmon? Give it to me, you know? I can eat lox, gravlax, uh, poached. Oh, my God! I could eat poached fish all day. Yeah, I get-l get kind of queasy from it sometimes. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Fish? - Mm-hmm. I wonder why. Not me. And you know it's one of those, uh, top 10 foods... in terms of being good for you. Uh... almonds... is one of them, I think. Uh, spinach. Yogurt, which is... kind of weird to me, 'cause I'm not a big yogurt fan. And I'm not an angry guy, you know. I'm about enjoying life. And, you know, sometimes stuff happens. So whose fault is that really? It's, uh- it's two people, you know? It takes two people to tango, so to speak. So I just think it's really unfair to- to put all the blame on one person. The good news is Sarah is totally fine with it, um, so- - That's great. - At least there's that, yeah. - Oh. Mm-mmm. - Mmm. Mmm. - You are just so cute, and this outfit is adorable. - Okay. - It's my mother's. I borrowed it from my mother. - Oh, that's- that's okay. - Sorry. - Okay. I get it. I'm sorry. Totally. I get it. Right after my divorce, I couldn't even imagine dating anybody else, no way, no how. - Uh-uh. So- - Okay. Can I see you again? Ahh! Oh! Here I am, this therapist, and I don't know what's going on with my own child. - It's so embarrassing. It's so humiliating. - Gwen- He says that you listen to him. You see him. He says that I'm in denial. That I'm trying to make him into something that I want him to be. That I don't see him. You know what? That's not even the point, I guess. The point is he finally told me the truth. Even though it's upsetting that I didn't even know, the point is- He doesn't like acting. I mean, I deal with this stuff every day. And here I am not realizing the effect that I'm having on my own child. The greatest tragedy of the family is the unlived lives of the parents." Jung said that. I say that to my patients almost every day. Hey, how is your therapy going? The, um, singing, naked, swimming thing? - Yeah, it's good. - Good. I'm so sorry about that. Oh, no. You know, whatever works. Geez, I wish that I had had something like that- so visceral and active- when I was going through my divorce. Thank you for listening. Come here. Give me a hug, will ya? - Thank you. - Gwen. Sorry about throwing the rock at you. - Ah. Ow! - Yeah. Please don't tell Jeremy that I was snooping in his room. Ohh! It's just he's been seeing some boy all summer and they just broke up and- I don't know, I was just looking... to find something, I don't know. - Sure. - Ahh. Intimacy is such a rare thing. And I want it for Jeremy so badly. Even if it is with some big hairy guy. Where is Jeremy? Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, Honky! Honky! - Get in here, you fucking idiot dog. - Hi. - Oh. - Sorry. - Hey. - I'm just, um, looking- Somebody's mom's here! Yo! Somebody's mom's here! No, sorry. It's the wrong house. Wrong Oh! Off! Oh! Ah, geez. Hello? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, I need to get out of here. Ohh. Ow. Where the fuck is bottom? Where the motherfucking fuck is motherfucking bottom? Whoo! - Whoo! - Amy Minkie's in the house! - Whoo! - Minsky! - You go, girl! - Whoo, yee-haw! - Oh, I just got a brain freeze from that ice. - You go, girl! You need another, girl. I'll get you another. Whoo. I haven't done this since high school. Whoa! Hey, what have you been doing since high school? - Yeah. - You know- Uhh. She was totally married and had everything. My mom told me. Cute husband, big apartment. Then he totally dumped her. - Yeah. - But that was... pssk! You know? 'Cause now I'm back here. It's whoo! So fun, you guys- - Here, girl. - No, I can't. - Oh, you can do that! - Yeah. Yep. I don't think I can. You can have it. No, you are here to par-tay," you divorce! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Minkie, Minkie, Minkie, Minkie! Sorry, Infinity. Ohh. Are you okay? Hey, what's wrong? Oh, Karen- I fuck everything up. Oh, hey, come on. I-I screw everything up. Everything in my life, Karen. Every fucking thing. It's, like, amazing. I fail everyone in my fucking life. Everyone who loves me. If somebody loves me, then I fuck it up. Oh. What are you talking about? Love isn't like a prize you get at the circus... for squirting water in the clown's face the longest. If somebody loves you, they just love you, you know? Shh. Ohh! What the fuck? Oh, no. Oh, no! My lips! Oh, my God! They cost a fortune! Look. Look what you've done! They- They were- They were right in the front hallway. I left a note on the door. Are you drunk? You are! Oh, God! Look what you've done. I can't believe that you've done this. You are so incredibly selfish. - Just- I'm gonna clean it up,just- - No! Just leave it. Don't you- Don't you touch anything. Don't you ruin anything more. - Oh, my God! - My God. Mom, I'm sorry. But they were completely corralled in darkness. - You take no responsibility for anything. - What? That is not true. Oh, yeah. Your father and I have taken you in. We let you sleep late. We let you loll around in that T-shirt. And you've just- you've just given up... the way that you've given up on everything you've ever started. What have I ever given up on? Oh. Well, let me- let me count the ways. Let's see, you- Oh, tennis camp when you were 10. - I was the only one with boobs! - You could get a bra that fit! You didn't have to jump ship! Oh, my God. I could give you a list that would fill a roll of toilet paper. All of those internships... and the projects on the living room oor that I had to clean up! And your- And your master's degree Daddy said that you would never finish. But he was so happy when you were gonna marry David. He said, Oh, Ruth, yes! She's getting married. She'll have someone to take care of her." I thought you were finally gonna wake up and see what you had. David left me, Mom! Okay? Remember? I didn't quit my marriage. He left me. And why... do you think? What? You think because I did something wrong, so he stopped loving me? Is that what you think? That I failed? Well, that's not what love is, Mom. It's not a prize that you get for coming in the clown's face at the circus. What? Listen. lf- If you behaved in your marriage the way that you behave here... of course it fell apart. Hey, I've been watching you for three months... do nothing to help yourself, do nothing at all. I have not been doing nothing for the past three months. How would you even know what I've been doing? You're so much more interested in those Wanguni lips... than you have ever been in me! Do you think anyone in this house has ever shown any interest in me? Oh, my God, Amy. Do you- What do you think life is? Just one- one ribbon cutting after another? I keep this house together. I keep this marriage together. And I don't get any accolades or praise. I'm like the family dog. And all I would like- one little thing I would like after all these years... is to spend some time with your father. And you just keep finding ways to make everything harder for me! Don't forget to turn out the lights. Well, I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent washout- uh, turnout And, uh, now I'd like to say a ew words. Don't worry about your mom. She'll settle down. You can stay here as long as you want. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. - Aims. Hey. - Hi. - You look nice, hon. - Thank you. I feel overdressed, like- What are you talking about? You can't overdress in New York. Come on. - Thank you. - Thank you. So look at this. Look at my shoe. You believe this? $700. All I did was walk from Union Square. It's terrible. What, you making fun of me? I bought these for a meeting I have tomorrow with one of the Olsen twins. I don't even know which one. - You should find out. - lf l can. - Before tomorrow. Thank you. - Thank you. So really, you really- You look good. I was worried. Really? Yeah, you know, last time. Unsightly circles? What? No, no, I don't- Come on, not like that. I-You know. No, I know. Yeah. I, um- I'm okay. I'm-l mean, I'm better. Wait justa sec. Good. Good. Can we talk openly? Um, I don't know. Can we order first? Just wait-just one second. Oh, God. Okay. What happened? - What? - Between us. Um, here? You-You-You want me to talk about this- about this here? I promise I won't cry. I'm not gonna- I- I just-l wanna know, okay? I don't know. I-l don't-l mean l just- You know, I felt-l felt- - Amy, can we- - Come on. Please? I-l promise. We'd been together for so long, you know. I-I-I- All right, you wanna- you wanna know why? I, um-l knew everything that was gonna happen to us. I mean, I knew everything that was gonna happen to me, more importantly... because I was- I was with you... and I just- I didn't- I didn't wanna know that. I didn't wanna-l didn't wanna see the end of my life like that. I loved you. You know. I mean, I- We were- We were compatible. Mm-hmm. We were great friends, right? And that was- that was great. That was great. But- So are you jumping out of planes now? No. No. Hey, can we order now? Are you still seeing Kimberly? No. No, that- No. That whole thing- That was- I mean, really, that was- that was crazy. You know, I thought I wanted to, um... be with someone successful, you know... like someone in my field. Aims, all she did was talk about her fucking cases. It was like I couldn't get away from work. It was, like, no escape, no island. I started seeing someone for a while too. Really? Yeah. I, um- Sorry. What can you do? I mean, it's- What? L- It's okay. I'm not sad. - It's not- I'm not sad. - What are you doing? I just don't feel like seeing you. You- why? Amy? Because I feel bad about myself when I'm with you. I feel really bad, and I always have. But I didn't know it. I- I was just so used to it. And I think... I just thought that that was being alive. To always feel bad and wrong and... just insecure and invisible. So thank you. Thank you for ending our marriage. - David. - Yeah? I really mean it. Thank you. Because I wasn't happy with you. And I would never have ended it myself. Truly. I- And you know what? I wanna change the papers. I'm not a fucking idiot. I invested a lot of time into you... and I just think I should be reimbursed. Okay. Amy, we're having a party! - Oh! - They picked daddy. - Amazing, huh? - Oh. - I bought the tickets for the trip. - Come, have a glass of champagne. - Isn't it just great? - Yeah, it's really great. It all worked out. You see, Ruth? - And you were right. - Your mother was worried. To Gallivanting the Globe." To Mom and Dad, for taking me in. Thanks. - Noah. - Come here. - Dad's retiring. - Congratulations to everyone. I'm gonna be my own boss. Finally fuckin' free. - I'm so happy for you. - Hmm. Hey. Oh, my God. We talked to Phil Bauer. I think he's in love with you. He said that you were the greatest listener he's ever met. Hi, Gwen! Are you okay? Can you- I have to go. See? See? That's why I never eat shellfish. Jeremy - Jeremy. - Shit. I didn't know that you were gonna be here, okay? I would-l wouldn't have come. I was hoping that you would be here. What are you talk- I thought- I thought that you didn't wanna see me. Look, okay. This whole thing is just- It's embarrassing for me, okay? And I'd just rather not even talk about it. You taught me how to be loved. I don't think that I even knew what that meant to be loved... before I met you. And you're- you're not a kid, Jeremy, like I said. You're not like some boy. I just had never been with a man before. And I didn't know what that was like. Fuck. That was a good thing to say. I don't want anything from you. I don't. And I know that we cannot be together. I know that, but- My God, when I'm 35, you- - Yeah. Yeah. - You're gonna be- - Right. I got it. - But I have to say... I just fucking love you. I just fucking love you. Okay. What are you doing? - I have to- - Oh, no, you're crazy. Hey, so I'm gonna be in the sublet for, like, two months until I find a place. Okay. At least I didn't screw everything up for you. That's good anyway. So, retirement- that's exciting. Finally. And the trip and- Oh, Dad. Huh? Are we ever gonna talk about this? What is there to talk about? I gotta go. Okay. What can you do? Mom? Mom? Mom? Yeah? Hey, I'm leaving. I never liked lapis. It's just cheap looking. I'm really sorry about everything, Mom. I'm glad that it all worked out for you guys in the end... and I'm glad that Dad got the clients... and I didn't completely screw everything up. Yeah. Well, it doesn't matter. What do you- What do you mean it doesn't matter? Well, we're not going on the trip. We're not going on the trip. - You're not? - No. He's not retiring. What? No, he doesn't want to. He doesn't want to, Amy. - Mom. - Nah. He never wanted to. He was never going to. So, I thought I would, you know sit here and just... organize this shit! There's nothing else to do. There's nothing else to do. - Mom. - No. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - I don't care. Mom, come on. - Hey, Mom, I'm so sorry. - Oh, stop. I'm so sorry. Come here. Come on, come on. Oh, Amy. I'm so sorry, Mom. - I'm sorry. - No. I'm sorry for what I've done... to you. I'm so sorry. We will see each other again, right? Mmm. You're not just gonna disappear forever, are you? No. No. Okay. So, Oberlin? Yeah. College is gonna be really exciting, Jeremy. - Fuck off. - Well, I'm just trying something, right? I'm trying to be- You'll fall in love, and I will kill myself. Yeah, that's better. Um... I wanted to tell you... I'm gonna finish my thesis. You are? Yeah. I'm gonna go Gallivanting the Globe"- - What? - with my mom. I'm gonna go with her and take pictures of her next to rivers. There are some amazing rivers out there. The driver just got out of the car. Well, he's- Okay. Okay. Okay.
