Can you turn it off, please. ... with limitless possibilities... RPG... Yes, Mr. Battier. ... your dreams come true... Welcome to RPG, Mr. Battier. Mr. Chan, this is Mr. Steve Battier, our last player. How are you Mr. Battier? As good as it gets, Mr. Chan. Have a seat sir, please. As we both are busy people, I'm not going to waste time. RPG is biotechnology' neurocellular answer to men' oldest aspiration: Eternal youth. The brain is like a computer with myriads of connections processing past and present information. After decades of experiments, my team here at RPG found a way to transfer this accumulated information to a new brain... Why the secrecy? Unfortunately, life and death are not on the market... yet. We have a problem: The young brain dies. If you want to experience what it is like to be young again, someone has to die. An old brain in a new body... it sounds heavenly. In order to access the information from the old brain in the new body, it' necessary that old body stay in absolute rest during the connection. That' why we keep them in there... ...in a controlled environment... Since the timeframe in which we can run the new bodies with the old brains is short, we decided to offer our clients a radical experience... you will play a game: A Real Playing Game. This experience will stay forever in your memory. What kind of game are you thinking of? You and nine others participants, in your young and beautiful bodies, will spend the next hours in a location from where only one will come out alive. I prefer chess. I'm not a violent man. If you are not sure of what you want, you can still quit. If you want to experience youth again you must complete the payment now. The other players have already paid and are waiting for you. You will not regret this. It will be an experience to remember! I can tell you something you don't know yet, I don't have much time... it will be so nice to just walk or move without pain and feel something like pleasure... and I don't mind being young forever. Can you do that Mr. Chan? Unfortunately at this time it seems impossible. We're still developing our technology... I thought impossible was not part of your vocabulary. There' no time for semantics now, we'll talk after the game. Time to choose your new body... they are beautiful, you'll see. What the fuck is this? Don't touch me. Sorry, wrong door. Follow me, please. No, not this one. Portugal in ruins? That seems just about right. Number 7. We can start now. Let' test this. This way... Ladies and Gentlemen, for the next 10 hours, you'll be young again. Let' choose a location where you want to live this extreme experience. You can choose now. Let' play! Let' play... Anybody there? Is there anybody out there? Anybody there? Who are you? What is this place? No idea. Do you know who you are or what this place is? I know very well you I am. And you? What are you doing here? Still trying to figure that out. What about you? I don't know. Someone must have drugged me... I just woke up here, I don't know. That makes two of us. Do you remember where you were before? No. Amnesia? Just a little. Same here. Let' get out of here... Maybe we can find a way out. Yeah... Don't come any closer! I'm telling you... I've nothing to do with this. Come on, do you think I'd bring a woman to this... this dump? Nobody touches me! I'm as lost as you are... I'm not going to harm you... Are they with you? I never saw them in my life! Who are you? Do you know where we are? No idea. What' going on here? This crazy woman thinks I'm going to attack her or something... Listen, it seems we're lost. Don't be afraid. Hey, down there, I heard you. I woke up in here, too. Come down... maybe we can talk some sense into this woman. It' ok... I've had women ran away from me before but never that fast! She'd be better off staying with us. We have no idea what' beyond these ruins. Where' the girl with the stick? Ran away. She' wasn't with you? What do you think? It looks like we just broke up, is that it? What about you? No, we came on our own, too. So, nobody knows anybody? Ah! What? Don't be scared, we're not going to hurt you. What happened to you? Some woman hit me in the head. That crazy bitch, han?! We need to teach her a lesson. It' just wrong to hit people in the head before even having a reason to do it. Do you think there could be more people like us... around here? We could take a look at the other buildings... maybe we find something there that tells us where we are... I don't think there' much to find. Hey... There is somebody there. Hey, you down there! Don't be afraid. We're coming down to talk to you. We're all lost. We are not lost. We're stuck here. You said stuck? What did you mean by that? You'll see. Hey! Guys... We've company. Let me guess, you woke up here and you don't remember where you were and you don't know where you are? Exactly. Do you know where we are? No, I only saw an old big building over there. Ok... Let' go and have a look. Nothing. I think it' better if we find a way out of this place. Yeah... You can not leave this place. There is no way out. Who are you? I'm the gamekeeper and you are the players. Players? Yes. This is a game and my job is to give you the rules of the game. What kind of a sick joke is this? I know you're a little confused but this is not a joke. Your real bodies are in our Game Center. You are not young but old and sick. You don't remember because your memories were adapted to the age of your new bodies. These bodies. Are you telling us that we are old geezers inside young bodies? You're not just old geezers... Believe it or not you are wealthy, powerful and famous people. And you can be Boris Znovarev, a Russian tycoon or... Kate Barrington, a famous Hollywood star! Yes, the choice was free, and you chose the body you liked. But you can't waste any more time, let see who you really are: Li Meng, Carlos Santiago, Yasmin Nova, Alice Fjallbacka, Steve Battier, Maria Moulineaux, Jorge Valdez, Okot Ba. Now... let me get back to the rules. Rule number one: Only one will be alive at the end of the game. Rule number two: One of you must die each hour or the game randomly takes care of that. You better stop with these rules? What the hell is all this? Who' behind this? If I were you, I'd be careful about what you reveal... it' dangerous... Why? Because you can only kill someone when you know who the real person behind the body is. And don't make assumptions on gender as well. You had the chance of choosing a female or a male body. As you can see here you are 5 women and 5 men, but in reality there are 4 women and 6 men. The bios on the holograms refer to who you are in the future, so some of you may be surprised at who you become. What if we kill someone we don't know? That will be a fatal mistake: You die if you come back here and wrongfully identify the hologram of the person you killed. If what you're saying is true, then in the future... In the present. Okay... in the present, we paid you to transfer our brains into these bodies. So why should we kill each other? Because it' a game... and you decided to play it. And how are we supposed to kill each other? Slapping ourselves to death... that' it? That' your call. This is ridiculous. I understand you may think that now, but I can assure you when you signed the contract you agreed to all these rules very enthusiastically. The clock is ticking. You have less than an hour until the first death. After you make the kill you have ten minutes to come back to this room and touch the hologram of the person you believe you have killed. Enjoy the game! Wait! This can't be true. We have to stick together; This guy tries to turn us against each other. This can be some kind of a sick game where rich old people get off on watching us killing each other. Get off? Did anyone see their name already? I didn't... Me neither. I don't think so... I hope not... Hey, you're reading that bio very carefully, is that you? I'm going to read them all. Hey, China man... are you really Chinese? Supposedly, some of these people are famous. Does anyone know who they are? They're from the future, we don't know them yet. They're not from the future, they are from the present. Good thinking. Maybe you are the computer geek over there. Maybe you created the game yourself. Oh, if you're so sure, why don't you kill me right now and get the game on? Wait a second, if all these characters are different nationalities, how come we're all speaking English? I got a theory about that, but if I tell it to you I may run the risk of being killed by my friend over there on the count of being a computer geek. Oh, pray, tell us anyway. I don't believe any of this bullshit. Maybe you are an agent from the people who made this game, sent here to convince us of its rules. Maybe if we just find a way out of here they can't control us. I agree. Okay, let' go. Hey... I think that one is the playboy. Why? Did you notice how he looks at us women? He can be the lesbian in a man' body. You're right. That makes sense. Given the opportunity what did a lesbian do? She'd incarnate in a man' body. Shit... Oh... What' this?! I never saw a fence like this... Beware, looks dangerous... Dangerous? I don't think so... Ok, let' see how dangerous it is. I told you we are prisoners here. Do you think it goes all the way around? Obviously. They want to keep the players on the field. We have 40 minutes to find out if this is for real or not. You speak, after all. What about food? Do you think they thought of feeding us while we're here? Who really believes what the hologram said is true? What?! Nobody? Your mind is everything. What you think you become. What' your most recent memory? See? You claim you don't believe it, but, just in case, you're not going to say something about yourself. Seems we all believe in this, after all. I don't. Good. Tell us something about you then. No problem. I like sports, to go out at night and movies. Everyone likes that. Are you a man or a woman? A woman, of course... but I think I might be gay... Why? Since I have some women in my memories... Wait. You're saying that you're that gay activist from the holograms? Maybe, but I'm not sure, really. If you really don't believe in the game why you just tell us who you are instead of evading the question? Because I don't know. - Bullshit. - I'm serious. I looked at the bios and I could only think that I would love to be 2 or 3 of those people. Hum... but I'm not sure who I am. You think... Hitler knew he was to be Hitler when he was 20? Who' Hitler? Hitler may not have known that he'd get that far but at 20 he was already a Nazi. There was no Hitler in those bios. There is a dictator and some autocrats... One of them is Chinese. Or Korean. Well... the real Chinese knows who he is, right? The real Chinese would do anything to pass as a westerner. This is good for the star. Who? The movie star. She' an actress, she can be whoever she likes. We're playing their game. We shouldn't even be considering this. Does anybody actually have the courage to kill someone else? Were there any killers in the bios? Apart from the dictators, but they don't normally kill with their own hands. Let' just go to the hologram room? It' almost time. What? You're not coming? Just in case, we should wait out the hour in our own. So you believe it? People under stress can do the most unpredictable things. But if you believe the rules, even if you're not close to any of us, you can die by the game. I still think it' better if we split up. Hell is other people. It' just like real life, isn't it? You never know what is going to happen after you die, if there' hell or heaven, if there' an afterlife, or if there' nothing at all... With that kind of thinking you could be the new age singer... 20 minutes... What' your plan? Let' follow the wall. Maybe there is a way out. Oh, but, when the hour is over, how are we going to know if someone killed anybody, or if there' a random death? We may not know. Unless we kill each other. Yah. I can't kill. Me neither. But there'll be only one survivor... I thought about that and I know what I prefer. What is it? I would rather die randomly by the game than to kill someone else. I'm so glad I ran into you... We don't even know each other names... Yah... But... if... if we're going to stick together we have to trust each other, right? Well, let' make this easier on us: The less we know about each other the better. Yah... Yah, you're right. We can still stick together, take care of each other, but without talking about us. Yah... It is an original date. You know... We don't have to talk about the same old things: Ex-lovers, family, our aspirations and fears... I like it. Yah! But if... if the idea of this game is to enjoy our young bodies... Yah!? We could really enjoy ourselves... I was fourteen and he was seventeen and hot... but when he kissed me I felt nothing... Zero. Since then I never kissed anybody else. Really? Yeah. Why? I don't want to be disappointed. And you never kissed a woman? Never. Why not? I can try... Why did you kiss me? You're not a lesbian. Why do you say that? Because you're not even a woman. I'm not a woman? Are you sure? Yes. And I don't have time for this shit. How much time' left? Very little. What' a colposcopy? What? And a speculum, do you know what it is? I don't know what you are talking about? And a hysteroscopy? Have you had one? I had an arthroscopy once... Oh... That' interesting. I don't understand where you're going with this. Are you a professional athlete? I told you I don't know who I am. I think you do. What happened? You better not look. Oh my god! Help! Help! Help! Oh my god! Help! Oh, my... Don't look... Don't look... Don't look... Why are you running? At the fence... It' horrible... Did you kill the sports superstar? Nope. But somebody did. We heard screams, did you hear them? Yeah, far away, some woman. Let' see if we can find her? Hey... hey, show up. I know you are there... We're nine, now. Did you see somebody in here? What happened? It' that woman... the one who was talking about not knowing who she was... I found her. Where? She was dead by the fence. I heard a scream and when I reached the fence she was dead... it' horrible... She wasn't a woman. What do you mean? The hologram that' missing was from a man. The football star. A man? If this is right. Are you sure it was an accidental death? What do you mean? Just cheking it wasn't someone working for the game that killed her... or him... I found him dead... I can't tell... We saw the body. Can you take us to her? I wouldn't recommend it. The question is, did somebody make the first kill, or was it the game? Do you really think nobody would find you here? I'd be ready. What if we joined forces? This game doesn't include any allies. If nobody kills anybody this hour you can die by the game like the sports guy! How do you know? I saw him die at the fence. You know he was hidden in a woman' body? Get out of there, it' weird to be talking to a bush. I'm not Moses and you're not God. You know the bible well. So do you. I hope I never get so old I get religious. Why do you care if I know the bible well? You're trying to find out who I am? Aren't we all? Who do you think I am? There is that African president who' a fervent Catholic. You think I'm a man? Don't you think she' hiding something from us? Who, she? No, the one that found the other dead at the fence. Why do you say that? I don't know but her story seemed a little bit off. Maybe she killed her. Maybe the game can not kill at all... In fifteen minutes we will have that answer. Quiet! Quiet, don't move or I kill her! Do you know who she is? Who is she? Maybe you will find out... but it will not be that easy. Maybe she decides to tell me who she is and die quickly or find out that there are worst things than dying! With that kind of attitude it' easy to know who you are. Oh yeah? And who am I? The Russian secret agent. Don't you think that is a bit obvious? Don't you believe in the capacity for people to change when their life is at stake? I believe a lot of things and right now I believe that you're not going to do that. You want to try me? No, I'm only saying what I believe. Tell me who he is and I let you live. I know you've been together; Maybe you talked a little after sex... You fucked her? He never said anything. You didn't get anything, if he' into politics... computers... movies? Keep away! You and me are going to have a little talk. Wait! What are you going to do? We're getting some weapons. What do you say? Is this you? The rebel princess from a Nordic royal family? Hun? No, I don't think you'd go to a man for protection, come on. And this lesbian? Hun? Is it you? Hun? I don't think you would use a man as a disguise? What about the artist? Lonely and recluse at her multimillion dollar estate? Is what makes sense for you to side with a man... you're helpless... you don't like violence... I could be a guy. It doesn't say here that any of these guys are gay. Why would I have to be gay? To enjoy fucking the other guy!? I could be faking it! Maybe you did. Come on... Movie star? Hun? Hun? Now let' find out if you're the artist... Without any fingers, how are you going to play the guitar? Aaaaaaaaahhhhh! Or is it the piano? Aaaaahhhh... Wasn't it the Indians who scalped the cowboys with stone axes? Just tell me who you are. I don't know who I am... Try another one... uuhhh... you don't know who you are? And you, do you know who you are? You want to bet? Make your move. You're pretty confident that you can beat me with that rock. Leave her alone. Oh! Someone who cares. The woman is bleeding. Your friend here fucked her and he doesn't care. If nobody kills anyone then we ruin the purpose of the game. You still don't believe this is real? I believe this is a test and we can win if we show we have the power to say no. Power is domination, control, and a truth that is a lie. Please... end this... You just need to tell me who you are. I'm the actress. I thought so. No! No! No... no... I thought you would try and save your lady. She' not my lady. You are a monster, you are a monster! Relax, it' only a game. Aaahhh... what if she lied? Let' get out of here. Where are you going? Don't you want to know if I win or lose? So what do you think? Uh? She was in pain, what reason would she have to lie to me? None, right? How do you think this works? We just touch it? What if nobody died? We'll never know. What are we going to do? I don't know, maybe we can have some fun... She lied. Yeah... she was the singer. And our friend here was the African president. And a fanatic catholic... What now? Now? We have another hour to kill... Thank you. What for? If you knew who she was you would have more chances to know who I am. I told you, I don't want to know. Yes, we don't want to know. We have to stay together, away from the others. You're right, only you and me. I hate waiting. Yes, you're a very patient person. Yes, I am. Do you know what' more exciting about this? Not knowing if you're a man or a woman. Labels are for clothing, not for people. Are you asleep? Tell me who you are. Don't worry, Mr. Battier... We had a little technical problem. So this is real? Am I really young? Yes, you are. And if you win the game you will stay forever young. It' good to be young. Yes, it is. We're sorry, this wasn't supposed to happen but you should be back in the game without any more problems and hopefully you won't remember this... Wait, tell me something... How do I know if this is true or just some kind of dream? You will find out. Is good to be young. Is good to be young. How you feel? Did something happen? Like what? To me, did something happen to me? You fell asleep... oh, you were talking in your sleep. What did I say? You said "this is real?" And "am I really young" and then you said "wait" and you woke up. I said "wait"? I just said "wait"? Yes. What did you dream of? I wasn't dreaming. What was it then? This is really happening. What happened? What did you see that made you change? I think it' better if we split up. Are you breaking up with me? I think this is for the best. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. You don't want to do this, you don't want to do this... you know I like you. Oh really?! You know, you didn't have to act with me. I know who you are. No, maybe that' because I'm not the one who has been acting. Am I acting? Maybe I'm the Russian military guy with combat training... The only combat training you've had is "stage combat" for theater and film... Do you think you know who I am? What about me? Are you really sure you know who I am? Yes, I am. Hey! Did somebody die? Where is your woman? What are you doing here? Did you kill somebody? Which one? Tell me! I know who you are and I saw what you did with that woman... guy. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know if we can kill two people in one hour, get ready, you're next. Hey! Where are you going? Nowhere. What' that? Did you kill someone else? I didn't kill anybody. I saw you in that room choosing the footballer hologram, I know you killed him. You're crazy, I couldn't kill anyone. And I'm pretty sure I know who you are. You play so many games and you're good at acting! You can only be the actress! Did you hear this? Where' the computer geek? What happened to the actress hologram? Somebody killed her. Maybe the computer geek? Why do you think the computer geek killed her? We saw him coming in here. Oh, I see, you killed someone... you killed someone and you have no idea who you killed. I killed the actress, someone has gone ahead before me and picked the right hologram. Why? Can there be two deaths in the same hour? I don't know. Where are the rules for this shit? Why are you so nervous? You have fifty-fifty chance. Shut up, and let me focus! Leave me alone... So, the computer geek killed the actress. Uh. There' only one woman left. If she is a woman. And we haven't killed anybody yet. We're missing all the fun... Don't worry, there'll be plenty of opportunities... We should read these bios again. I don't want to happen to me what happened to this guy. Hey, where are you going? Another hour has gone by, who died? Does it matter? You have to keep track of that. What for? You're going to try to kill me? I don't know who you are. I know you. Maybe you're the humanitarian... you're not going to kill anybody. You sure? Where' the woman who was following you around? Did you kill her? We're all turning into animals, aren't we? I'm just trying to survive. Aren't we all? For me, survive means not dying, it doesn't necessarily mean I have to kill. Well, we don't always have that option. If this is a video game there should be bonuses, right? Hidden weapons, food, health packages... This isn't a video game. But it is a game? If it' not a game it sure looks like a game. - Have you found anything? - No. Then it' a shitty game. You bet. Just tell me who died! What have you got to lose? And what if we go and kill the geek? You really think it' him? We could try to find out. What if you are the computer geek? Why do you say that? The one you call the geek, is the only one who had a girlfriend. Maybe he' the playboy. - Come on, you also got laid. - Yah. So I could be the playboy, trying to make you wrongfully kill the other guy? It' a possibility. Let' find the other guy anyway and see what he has to say about himself. We need to be careful. Why? He killed already. He could be the Russian killing machine. Uh? But we're two against one, let' go. Hey... what are you doing? I'm trying to get to the other side. I don't think you can. You've just saved my life. Group meeting and we weren't invited? The humanitarian geek here just saved my life. Oh really? Tell us about it. If you all kill me, how are you going to know who' responsible for my death? Only one person can identify the hologram. What? You expect us to lynch you? We don't actually know if the game will kill anybody if we don't do it ourselves. Yes we do, the first kill was the game... The first kill was Maria, the lesbian. I saw her throw the other against the wall. He' right. I saw her identifying the hologram. What do you suggest? We stand down for the next hour and see if the game really kills? What have we got to lose? Ok, it will be like playing Russian roulette. Let' go to the swimming pool and wait out the next hour. It is as risky as trying to kill me. Kill him, or wait for the hour? 10 minutes. When you woke up in the game center, did you see the others? No. What are you talking about? I woke up in the game center. This is... this is all true. That' why you killed the actress? She attacked me. But you knew who she was? I had an intuition. You're saying you made a guess and you got lucky? Luck is all part of the game. Almost time: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... So, what now? In the last hour there were two deaths. Must have given us an hour credit without a kill. That' why you were so confident? What' your suggestion for the next hour? We aren't all thinking the same thing... I know what I have to do. I'm coming back for all of you. I'll be waiting. You can run but you can't hide! Don't be afraid! This is only a game! Come out! Behave like a Queen! A member of the royal family should face her execution with dignity! Be a lady and face death! There you are. So you finally decided to give up running away. No, I've decided to play. Excellent. You're not used to video games, are you? I prefer real games. If you played video games you'd know that there were areas where you could find bonuses, like health packages, food or weapons. Is that so? Yeah. Did you find anything? You bet. That' not fair. It' all about the game. So you know who I am then? No. So you have the power to kill me but you can't. I don't know it yet. But I have a whole hour to find out. That' what you think. Who has a gun? In video games there are hidden weapons in obscure corners and secret rooms. We looked everywhere. I don't know about you guys but I'm not going to wait here to find out. I've never been shot before but I can imagine how painful that is. So, why don't you tell me who you are and I will spare you the suffering. Or you can spend the next 50 minutes of your life in excruciating pain! You're so nave! Really? All I have to do is give you the wrong name and you'll die when you touch the hologram, like the other guy. You're right. I'm going to kill the geek. Hey there, your royal highness! He who controls others may be powerful, but he who has mastered himself is mightier still! What the hell are you doing? Good luck in finding out who I am... What the fuck! That' not right! I didn't kill you so I don't have to identify your body, right? Fuck! Oh Jesus. Fuck! Where did you find this? It was inside a box. Did you know the Chinese was a real China man? I'm so stupid! Are you going to kill me? I'd rather do something else with you. Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't be afraid! Didn't you listen what the other guy said? When we die we go back to the future where our old bodies wait for us. Let' enjoy our youth while we can. No way. But thanks. Thanks? Thanks for what? Now I'm certain of who you are. Oh, great! So tell me... uhh? Who am I? I've seen the way you look at women and how shocked you were when you discovered one of them was really a man. Oh... yeah, that' true. Anyway, I'm the one who has the gun. And I'm the one who has the bullets. Fuck! Looks unloaded, ah? I've got the bullets. Let' make a deal? What kind of deal? You give me the bullets so we can get rid of both of them, enjoy together our last few hours in these young beautiful bodies and, at the end, we can still play Russian roulette to decide who wins. Okay? Give me the bullets. Do we have a deal? We'll see. Hey! Wait! Wait up! Let' talk! Hey! I mean it! Wait. No, no, no... don't go, don't go, wait. Stay here with me! Are you sure you don't want to sit here next to me? You don't give up easily, do you? I just hate to see beauty wasted. Olha, que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graa... essa menina que vem e que passa... Ideas are more powerful than guns, aren't they? We would not let our enemies have guns, why should we let them have ideas? That' very interesting, who said that? Are you trying to guess who I am? Since everyone seems to be certain of who I am. So, I'm not the computer geek. I know who you are. Are you sure? And that doesn't scare you? No. Because you don't know who I am. You think so? Remember the actress? She' down there. Why would a computer geek kill a good-looking girl who was into him? Self-defense, you said that. And you believe me? The playboy wouldn't kill her either. Unless he got tired of her. The playboy isn't the only one who is still alive. You're trying to suggest that you are the princess? I'm just trying to say that I could be anyone except you. Ok! Let' say that you are the princess, for a second. Why did you choose a man' body? She is a rebel, against her own royal condition, her family, unstable, independent. Turning into a man could be her liberation. What are you trying to prove? Think twice before you kill me. You don't want to get it wrong at this point of the game. Why don't we go back to see if the others are still alive? We have time for our final confrontation. Thought you said ideas were more powerful than guns. You still have a weapon. Is this good enough for you? - You walk in front! - No. We walk side by side, you still can be the Russian guy. Anybody can have karate lessons... - Even the princess... - Even the princess... How do you feel? You want to bet? On what? Which one of them will come back... I don't care. It' just for fun. I had enough fun for one day already. I totally got it. What? You're not a woman. Why do you say that? You're not a woman! That' why you didn't want to have sex with me. You admit it? I don't have to. Think what you want. Hey guys! Which one of you has the gun? No one. He decided to throw it in the lake. If there was a gun in the game, there can be other things. What you need right now is a first aid kit. You're bleeding a lot. Doesn't it hurt? Not really. Can you move? Per... fec... tly... fine... She' not a woman. Is he dead? Hum... hum, it looks like it. Shit. You've got ten minutes left, to choose the hologram. That' easy, I'll do it now. It would be nice if you get the right one. Why are you so interested in weather I get it right or not? If you fail you die too and it' between me and the killing machine here. He' the Russian? I think so. But he doesn't know who you are? No. And you really don't have the gun? No. Too bad... Well, if I've been counting the time right, we got a couple of hours more without having to kill anybody. What do you want to do, an orgy? Yes! Do you? Go fuck yourselves. I'm going to take care of her, we'll meet later. No... We won't. Fuck! Do you really think you were going to find the gun? What else could I do? Could come with me. What makes you think you're any different from the others? I already said no. We both know who we are and we both know that we're decent people. Oh, really? Was it decent of you to kill your girlfriend? It was self-defense, she tried to kill me. How do I know you're not going to kill me. Trust me, I will not kill you. I want to stay young for as long as possible. Ok then. And how are we going to spend the time we have left? I'm not sure, you tell me. Let' go take care of the Russian guy, then we can have some fun together. No need. I already took care of him. What happens now? I won. Shall we? I won the game, right? Yes. Let' play the hardest part. Congratulations. I want to be forever young in this body and I don't care how much it will cost. I told you we're not sure if we can keep your brain in that body for more than the time you have left. You know, I'm a very rich man but I prefer to be young and poor than old and rich. How much Mr. Chan? I'm not sure. We'd have to keep this entire structure just for you. Give me a number, Mr. Chan. If you insist, I can try. But I'm not sure how long we can keep it working. I'll take that risk. How much? I hope I won't regret this. I'm sure you won't. Young again? Are you sure you can do it? Yes, I can. You know... I'm old and thick. I have nothing to lose. I will do it! Yes, sir. You won't regret it, sir. It will be an ultimate experience. I'll get in touch with you again so we can settle all the details. Okay, then. We did it! I still don't know how you do it. I'm a kind of priest. They want to believe and I help them believe. Next time I want to play the Gamekeeper. Oh, no, no, you can't. I've talked to him so he knows me. Why do men always have to get the best parts? It' not fair. Turn it on. Excuse me, sir? Turn it on... Louder... I like it!
