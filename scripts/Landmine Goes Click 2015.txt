That's right, now we're gonna play the game! - Strip! - [Ilya] Okay, let me play! Strip! Now I'm gonna count to three, And if you don't undress, I'm gonna pull the trigger anyway And that's wasting a chance. Don't do that. One, two, three... [Gun clicks] Oh. Listen, I'm really disappointed In your fucking parenting skills! [Ilya] I... i can explain. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! You need to explain to her That she should undress. Okay? Explain to her, She's not wearing much, ilya, This is a fun game. You know, she's not wearing... she's got a bra, She's got a shirt, And this pretty little dress. Odds are she gets one in six that she gets a bullet In her pretty fucking head, now isn't it? Those are good odds, you like those odds, don't you? Those are better odds than Alicia got! - [Ilya screams] - [Chris] You fuck! So, we're gonna play the game, aren't we? - [Ilya] Yes! - That's right! Strip! Tell her to undress, one! [Ilya speaking native language] Two! Hurry up! [Ilya] She's undressing, yes... She's undressing, that's right, Good girl, three! [Gunshot] [Sobbing] [Tanya shouting in native language] [Ilya sobbing] [Tanya screaming] [Tanya screams] [Tanya and ilya cry]
