Ah, there we go. - So, you're about seven weeks along. - ZACH: Ooh. And everything looks really good. ZACH: Honeymoon baby. (CHUCKLES) The pill is about 99 percent effective, but, occasionally, this happens. Okay. ZACH: She winked at me. I saw that. Because I got good sperm. (DR. LUDKA LAUGHS) This is what you started. What? It's good, strong sperm. DR. LUDKA: I'm gonna prescribe vitamin B... and iron, since you're a vegetarian. Mmm-hmm. ZACH: Yeah, I've been trying to break her of that. It's for the baby. Mmm-hmm.

ZACH: Hey, have your ankles and toes started swelling up? SAMANTHA: Oh, my God, with the ankles. Yes, they're swelling up. I read in the baby book, it says that those things swell sometimes. They do. My entire thing is swelling right now. It looks good. You could use a little meat on your bones. Mmm-mmm. I don't like it. ZACH: Hey, ew. I mean, whoa. What? Oh, God. ZACH: You haven't noticed that? No, what is that? Oh. Does it hurt? No, I think my body is being taken over by hormones. Ugh, this is not supposed to be happening yet. Don't look at that. All these weird things are gonna happen to you. You're making a person inside of your person. (CHUCKLES) Seriously, that's amazing. Sam. Mmm? You're making a baby. I can't do that. Yeah. (SAMANTHA SNORING) (ZACH SIGHS) (SNIFFS) Mmm. (MAVERICK WHINES) ZACH: Oh, she woke you up? Yeah. So, your mother snores. Even though she categorically denies it. But we now have hard evidence. So, if she ever denies it again... Oh, hey. Sam. Sam, hey. Jesus, Sam. Sam. Hey. (MOANS) Go to sleep. ZACH: What are you doing? Hello. ZACH: They're getting restless. So, I'll leave it to Sam.

Thank you. Seven, king, so I get it. (ZACH LAUGHS) Tofu? ZACH: What did you think it was? I wish you wouldn't have told me it was tofu. I mean, did they do a sonogram? SAMANTHA: Oh, yeah. Did you get a picture? SAMANTHA: She wants a picture to show everybody immediately. MRS. MCCALL: Oh, ultrasound. If you go with a C-section, your body just bounces right back. - Great. - What? Natalie, why don't you try to not micro-manage their entire thing? I checked under the fridge. It's not there. You lifted the fridge up? I looked under it. We'll find it. I couldn't find it. When I do, I'll email it to you. I hope you find it. SAMANTHA: We Will. I'm just gonna be on pins and needles to see it. (LAUGHS) Oh, my God, Sam, you're bleeding. Oh, God. Oh, jeez, here. ZACH: Sam, here you go. This is clean. Tilt your head back. (ALL MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY) ZACH: This is where you'll go to school. I got beat up here a couple times, but that's not gonna happen to you. You're gonna be a much cooler kid. (BELLS TOLLING) Ah, this is where me and your mom got married. Very pretty church. This is where we walk the dog. Here's the Anderson house. It still looks like shit. Shit, fuck. Maverick! (BARKING) (GRUNTS) Maverick, God damn. Hey, hey. Maverick! (BARKING CONTINUES) Come here. Hey, no, no. No, no, we don't live here. Come on. (GROWLING) All right, come on. Come on. This is your house. (THUNDER RUMBLING) That's your room up there on the left. Your granddad says that it's a money pit... but it's got good bones. Shit. Hey Hey. Do you think this looks too mish-mash? Um... Do you want the truth? - ZACH: I'm giving our baby a tour of the house. - SAMANTHA: Yeah? Hey, that's not the house. Sorry. ZACH: And the grand finale, your room. Formerly known as your mother's office. (SAMANTHA CHUCKLES) But now we are converting. Thank you for giving up your office. Mmm-hmm. Whoa! SAMANTHA: Jeez. (CHUCKLES) Watch it, there. I study on the couch all the time, anyway, so it's not a big deal. It's a pretty good room, though. She really didn't do anything in it, so I think it's only fair. It's gonna be kind of cool, though. You and I are gonna hang in here. SAMANTHA: Hey. - Do you see this guy across the street? - ZACH: Huh? SAMANTHA: He's just staring up at the house. ZACH: What the fuck? SAMANTHA: Oh, it's creepy. - ZACH: Hey. - SAMANTHA: Hi. - How was class? - Ow! Ugh. It was fine. I just had to leave because I'm starving. I think there's some leftover Pad Thai in there. I know, I don't want that. Okay. (GRUNTS) Um... I'm just gonna eat a bunch of cookies. (ZACH CHUCKLES) How are you feeling? Fine. I'm just hungry. (SAMANTHA IMITATES DRUM ROLL) EMILY: All right.

Your body is going through a beautiful transformation. (WHISPERING) That's a load of shit. INSTRUCTOR: I want you all to imagine a place that's calming, quiet. Make it a specific memory. Where are you? (WHISPERING) On the beach on our honeymoon. INSTRUCTOR: How old are you? Are you alone? Breathe into this memory that brings you joy. (WOMEN GROANING) INSTRUCTOR: Okay, everyone, please breathe. If you're gonna sit up, sit up slowly. Very slowly. Keep breathing, everyone. Please remain calm. ZACH: Sam. Are you okay? ZACH: So, this is happening. Yep. We are buying baby stuff. (SING-SONG) Baby stuff! (CHUCKLES) - Let's go crazy. - Yeah, let's go nuts. Ooh! Uh... Do you want to practice a little diapering? Get a little wrap around this guy? (ZACH STAMMERS) I'm good. You don't want to do that? He's not even in a box. He's clearly dirty. Yeah, where'd this baby come from? I don't know you, baby. ZACH: You bent him over, looked at his ass to see where it came from. I just wanted to know if he had a name or something. SAMANTHA: Ah... (CHUCKLES) It's a milk pump! SAMANTHA: Not at all. No? No. We need one though, right? Yeah, we do actually need one. I never want to see you do that ever again. (CHUCKLES) Probably not. No, I think we got everything. This is all a baby needs, right here. Ow! ZACH: Are you all right? (GROANS) ZACH: I'm gonna go get the car, all right? Just hold on. SAMANTHA: No, I'm fine. ZACH: No, seriously, Sam. Please, just wait there. I'll be right there. Whoa!

Yeah, can we talk to her? I don't think she's gonna be able to come back. Let's talk about your symptoms. ZACH: Oh. Okay. DR. DYLAN: Huh. The baby looks healthy. But it's turned around.

Are those...? DR. DYLAN: Yeah, it can be. She just doesn't seem like herself lately. Is there a history of mental illness in her family? Uh, I don't know. She took some meds during college for anxiety. I don't really know what they were. Um... We don't really know anything about her family. Her parents were killed in a car crash and they had to cut Sam out of her womb. I'm sorry. I had no idea. (DOOR OPENS) SAMANTHA: Hey. ZACH: You look beautiful. (SAMANTHA SCOFFS) SAMANTHA: I'm really sorry. - ZACH: It's all right. - DR. DYLAN: It's all right. DR. DYLAN: Um, I'm gonna do an amnio now, just to rule out any issues. Especially since you don't know what may run in your family. ZACH: Okay. Are you all right? Mmm. Okay. Good. I'm good, too. Good. I was worried about you. I know. I could tell, because you asked. (CHUCKLES) Uh, is this gonna hurt? DR. DYLAN: Oh, it's just a little pressure. It'll be over before you know it. I need you to stay very still. Nurse, watch the monitor, please. (BREATHING NERVOUSLY) Mmm-hmm. Are you ready? Just relax. Take a deep breath. (INHALES DEEPLY) (GROANING) Mmm. Mmm-mmm. ZACH: Are you okay? - No. - NURSE: It's okay. Something's wrong. Can you get it out? Can you get it out? - Keep her still. - ZACH: Is everything okay? - No, no. Mmm-mmm. - ZACH: Just try to stay still. DR. DYLAN: Samantha, we're almost there. Can you get it out? Can you get it out? Please, get it out! - You're gonna hurt yourself. - Sam, please. Get it out! ZACH: Can you get it out of her? Thank you. It's out. It's done, it's done. (GROANING) ZACH: Hey, hey. It's done. It's okay. All right? It's okay. SAMANTHA: I can't do this. I can't do this. It's all right. ZACH: I'm really worried about her. I don't know what to do. DR. DYLAN: Do you think she'd ever actually hurt herself? ZACH: What? No. I don't know, I don't think so. Just to be safe, we'll be keeping a close eye on her. ZACH: Okay.

ZACH: Do you want to take off while we wait for the results? Go to a spa, or... Let's just get out of town. - It's a good idea. - Yeah. I'm just thinking, though, you've already taken so much time off of work. And I've got finals and we should probably be close to the doctor right now. ZACH: All right. It's just a thought. It's a good thought. I'm gonna be all right. I know. (MEN WHISPERING) SAMANTHA: One second. Okay. ALL: Surprise! (GASPS) MRS. MCCALL: Happy birthday, darling. Wow, thank you. Great, son. How are you? I'm very well, thank you. Hi, Ma. BRITTANY: Happy birthday, Aunt Sam. Oh, my gosh. MASON: Happy birthday! No, I'm fine, I just gotta rest. - Are you sure? - Yeah. EMILY: Why are you guys hiding in the corner? ZACH: Hey. EMILY: Looking good! - Thank you. - Um... She's just gonna go upstairs for a little bit, take a rest. I gotta lie down. I'll be back. I'll come up in a little bit and check on you. SAMANTHA: I just need a few minutes. (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) I'll clean all this up. No, I got it, I got it. - I'm gonna help you, too. - It's fine, I got it. You guys got everyone here, I'll clean it all up. It's no problem. That's what friends are for. - Can I have some cake? - Yeah, here you go. - Is this too big a bite? - No. Oh, that's cute. - MASON: We're the sweetest. - EMILY: We're so cute. How's Sam? I don't know, I haven't been up there since she went up. Honestly, in general, she has not been herself. The doctor says that everything is fine, and we've done all these tests. But she's just convinced that there's something wrong with the baby. - She's adamant about it. - Wow. BRITTANY: Braedon. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Braedon? Come on, I know you're in here. (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) (GASPS) Braedon. (BREATHING DEEPLY) Braedon? (WHISPERING) Braedon, come out. It's not funny anymore. (CREAKING) Braedon. Get out!

Lazy bones. (CHUCKLES) It's all right. (MAVERICK BARKING) (SCOFFS) Shh. ZACH: Mav, hey. Hey. (GRUNTS) You know, we talked about the summer courses. So, I figured I'd just get a couple of classes going... and then go back to the full load in the fall. You don't want to just wait until the fall? (SIGHS) No, I don't want to just wait until the fall. (STAMMERING) Okay, I was just thinking because... I know, it's just that this has come up and I... No, I know. But the baby is coming in March. I know it's not gonna be easy. But I don't want to put everything on hold just to... We're not putting everything on hold indefinitely. I gotta keep working. But if I stop doing it now... then I feel like I'm not gonna be able to start back up again. I'm gonna be stuck in this house and I'm gonna become some housewife. Then I'm gonna turn into your sister. I'm gonna be Natalie, and I don't want to be her. Sam, you're not gonna be Natalie. It's you and me. That's what it's turning into. I know that... but this isn't what I wanted to begin with, okay? I didn't want to get pregnant and now I am. And I just want life to go back to normal. I don't want to talk about it anymore and my fucking hair is falling out, okay? Sam! Whoa. HEY. ZACH: Hi. Are you excited? Yeah! Yeah, why? Because today's my First Communion. ZACH: Oh, shoot, my bad. (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Hi. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. How are you feeling? Well, well, well. Are you ready for your big day, young lady? You've got the whole family here. Yeah. (ALL CHUCKLING) Hello, Sam. Hi. - How are you doing? - I'm doing well, how are you? (COUGHS) I'm good, really. So, when is the little one due? ZACH: One month. One more month. - One month. That's good. - ZACH: Are you all right? MR. MCCALL: Do you want a bottle of water? No, I'll be fine. One month. That's the home stretch, right? ZACH: Yeah. (COUGHING) I've just got something in my throat. I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. (CHOIR SINGING HYMN) I think that's the nicest procession I've ever seen. Boys and girls, we are so proud of you. And we are so happy... to have you here this morning on this big important day in your lives. Newest members of our church to gather round for the Liturgy of the Eucharist. We are here to celebrate with you today your first Holy Communion. Also, the first time... you receive our Lord Jesus Christ into your souls. Uh... (COUGHS) Excuse me. Uh, this sacrament...

(GRUNTING) SAMANTHA: I don't remember what happened back there. With Father Thomas. Did I... Did I do that to him? What? No. (SOBBING) Hey. (SNIFFLES) What the fuck is wrong with me? ZACH: Hey, hey! Stop, Sam. Look, it's me. It's Zach. Hold on. Stop. Stop! All right? Hey! It's okay. (SAMANTHA STRUGGLING) "Zach"... ZACH: Let's just go. Let's just go home. FATHER THOMAS: Oh, lam so sorry.

(SPEAKING SPANISH) - ZACH: Look at this little guy. - SAMANTHA: Hey, little guy. Yeah, I hear it. No, Zach, come on. These men are staring at me. ZACH: What? SAMANTHA: I said, "These men are staring at me." Hey, babe, let's put it away. (MAN CHANTING IN LATIN) (MEN CHANTING IN LATIN) (MAN WHISPERING IN LATIN) (OTHERWORLDLY ROARING) - ZACH: Come on. - SAMANTHA: No. ZACH: Yes. I'm sorry, but we gotta get up. SAMANTHA: Ugh. I'm so hung over. ZACH: Yeah, no kidding. Hey, Mason, it's Zach. Um... Can you come over for a little bit? I need to talk to you about something. Thanks. And I'll meet you outside, in front of the house, okay? I don't want to bother Sam. Okay. SAMANTHA: (COUGHS) Mmm... How did we get home last night? ZACH: I don't know. The guy in the cab? What the fuck? He was like our cab driver, on our honeymoon. So I came home, looked at all the tapes, and there's all this mystery fucking... Look at this. MASON: You sure, man? Maybe it's some weird shit they do down there to scare tourists. Whoa, what the fuck? What the fuck? It's gone. (STUTTERS) MASON: What are you talking about? I was literally just looking at this shit right before you... I was looking at this right before you came in, and now it's gone. It's empty. It's gone. The fucking tape is gone now. Fuck! Why don't you just take a breath, man? No, I don't need to take a... Wait, hold on. What the fuck? NURSE: We've been monitoring him 24/7. ZACH: Uh, do you think I can talk to him privately? NURSE: If he needs anything, we'll be right outside. ZACH: Father Thomas, how are you? I had a small stroke. Yeah, we heard. Are you gonna be all right? How is Sam? Um, she's okay. That's actually why I wanted to... I'm glad that she's okay. Talk to you. Um... I saw these weird symbols on our honeymoon. And, um, I just don't know really what they are. And I thought you might... because everything I've seen says they're, uh, religious symbols. So, uh, there's these ones... and then there's that. There's a bunch more. These are the only ones I've actually seen in person. The other ones were all just linked to it when I started looking. John, first John. What? First John, 2:18. "And children, this is the last hour." "You have been told the antichrist is coming..." "and so, that there are many that are coming." "That is how we know it is the last hour." What are you talking about? These are from early, early religion. These are... early religion, there is a sect, dissident. They tried to bring the church down in it's early days. They did rites, and they used those symbols. They painted them on the point of entry and on the nest. The point of conception and the point of birth. ZACH: What? So that he could get in. There was ash all around. There was ash everywhere. The antichrist is coming. "So will there be many antichrists..." "and that is how we know it is the last hour." "They will be coming." I didn't mean to upset you. It's the last hour. I'm really sorry. I don't think you can be here with that anymore. You have to go now. I need you to go now, Zach. Yeah. I'm very, very tired and I need you to go. - Put that away. - It's gone. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. You've upset me. Just go. - Go. - I hope you feel better. Now! Go! Okay, all right. (MACHINES BEEPING RAPIDLY) ZACH: Nurse? Nurse, can you... Um this one is from you. This is from Emily. (WOMEN CHEERING) There's more to come. That's just a taste. EMILY: Whose is this one? SUZIE: I don't know. It doesn't have a name. Does this belong to anybody? Well, anonymous. SUZIE: It's nameless. Anon. SUZIE: You're just getting gifts from everywhere. Sorry, whoever this is from. Brooke! What a sweetheart, Brooke! (WOMEN CHEERING) I didn't read the note, so, I don't know what's happening. BROOKE: That's nice of you. EMILY: Sam, are you okay? (GLASSES CLINKING) ZACH: How was the shower? SAMANTHA: Fine. (DISTANT CLATTERING) Did you hear that? (ZACH BREATHING HEAVILY) (CAR ALARM RINGING IN DISTANCE) ZACH: Fuck. Every window in the house, but a lot of them in these. This is really mostly where I see it, so I don't know what to do. You know, I have to admit, it is, uh, kind of weird. Someone was in here, all right? Someone broke into our house. Wait, hold on a second. But, look at the porch. (MUFFLED CONVERSATION IN DISTANCE) I can file a report, and call us if there's any other problems. That's all I can do for now. You have a nice night.
