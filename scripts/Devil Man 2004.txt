Akira, you should become one of us, too. But I always enjoyed to be with him. On that day... we had sports-class as always, and as always I was the first one being tired. You are already exhausted, Akira? Leave me be. Keep running, Ryo. In school, he was the best in everything. Always. I admired him, because he was superiour to me in everything. Akira! Miki! What's up? Why are you smiling like an idiot? Why do you always have such a bad mood? - Alright, see you tomorrow in school. - OK, see you in school. We always said goodbye with the same words. You two look like each other, but I don't like him. Luckily, you two are not related to each other. He can't laugh. Why do you actually spare your time with him? MAKIMURA Mikis family has taken me up. Four years ago, my parents died in a traffic accident. As I had no other relatives anymore, family Makimura took me up. That is how I got a family again. A cake? Why do you bake a cake this early? Did you forget, Akira? Today is your birthday. It should become a surprise-party! He never listens to those things. - It always was like that. - I'm sorry. My birthday isn't that important, so please don't make any inconvienences. What are you talking about? You are with us for four years now,... - you are belonging to our family. So never say something like that again, alright? - Alright. That's right! - Now let's have breakfast. Bon aptit. - Bon aptit. Tell Asuka Ryo that I will kill him, if he ever looks at me again as I would be a piece of dirt. You won't do anything to Ryo, I won't let that happen! - Is that all? - If Ryo isn't with him, he is like a girl. In Junior High School, Akira got beaten up by someone. - You want to know what Ryo has done then? - What? I'll tell you. He came into the classroom with a garden-scissors,... and without saying a word,... he cut off his fingers. The teacher was completely shocked, couldn't move... and did nothing. Stop it, Ryo! Then someone took action who always was made fun of because of his weakness. Call an ambulance! It was up to him that the fingers could be saved. Fudo Akira told you to leave Ryo alone. Not because he is worried about Asuka Ryo, it's because he is worried about you! Ryo even wouldn't stop before murder. Akira knows that. I'm too weak. I want to become stronger. - When you are appearing here, everyone is getting a bad mood. - You get on my nerves! Never show up here again! What is going on here? Please don't take care of me, otherwise they will attack you, too. - Keep yourself out of this! - That's because you aren't defending yourself. You have to fight Miko. Ryo, you were absent for one week for no reason. Where were you? Excuse me. Alright. Take your seat. - So, where were we? - Ryo! Who has done that, Akira? Do you still know it, you promised it. Do you remember? Yes. But that is not important anymore. Akira, my father is dead. - What does that mean, your father is dead? - Take a look on the way. Here. Our team was apparently able... to advance to an underground lake at the South Pole. In an old earthlayer we found... an energy source with which you could melt a nitrogen-core. With nitrogen you produce more than 8 million times more energy than with oil. However, we unfortunately were wrong. It wasn't a form of energy. There were intelligent Lifeforms behind, which lived on other species. We immediately closed our lab. They were extremely dangerous demons. We tried everything, but we had no chance. It was too late. Ryo, the demons attacked the several thousand workers in the labs and took possession of their bodies. Mine, too. What's that? What the hell is that? What do you think? Akira! - A demon has taken possession of him. - What does that mean? The same thing happened to me. Akira, help me! I'm not a human anymore. I prefer to die. Kill me. Now. Kill me! Stop it! We are friends, why should I kill you? Amon the Fearless is raised! No, that is not Amon! He is a human. He must die! Beat it, demon! Akira... Ryo, you are beautiful. I... I killed him, right? I became a demon. No, you have a human heart, you are a devilman. Devilman? Only your body. Your heart is human. Happy Birthday, Devilman! Akira! Yes? Your late birthday present. That is... for me? You have a driver's license, but you don't have a vehicle, so we are giving it to you. It is not new, but I hope you like it. Uncle, aunt, Miki, thank you very much. That's so cool! That feels so good! See you later. - Miki, when I... - What? - If I wouldn't be a human... - Not a human? Why? Doesn't matter. See you later. Ryo! That you can't cut off our fingers... we beat you to it. Hey, do you have fear without the garden scissors? You really are childish. Ryo, stop it! - Wait a moment! - Do you want to make fun of us? What was that? That was really cool, Akira! Ushiku! Akira, why are you alone? - Strange. - Hmm... What are you painting? An interesting picture. Maybe, one day, you will become a painter. That would be cool, but I can only make strange pictures. At first, it was a kind of physiotherapy for my fingers, but now I really like to paint. I dream of Ryo nearly everyday, and you know, what he is saying? "Actually, I'm the devil. " Actually, I'm the devil. And then he is cutting of my fingers with a scissors. Akira, beware of Ryo. I pretended to be cool, because I wanted to be strong. That why I mopped you up. Anyway you helped me. - I'm sorry. - Forget it. Finally I can tell you: I thank you. Shit! I want to fight. I need an enemy. Why...? Amon! You have called me. What do you want? Who are you? You will remember it, when you are at the place you were born. Come with me. Akira! Akira! Akira? Despite your metamorphosis you can't remember me? Amon? Amon? That is your name. You like it? This human child called you Akira. Do you object to it? You are just a demon, nothing else. Really? You are just a small human child, too. Alright. Then die! You are the one who will die, demon! The powers of the Devilman absent from my body. I can't do it. How helpless you are, Amon. I don't want to watch any longer how your consciousness is being is dominated... by a human. Now die. Selene! Ryo! Everything OK? Yes, but what happened to my stomach? The wound is healed. Your body cells regenerated. The body cells of the demon who annexed you, regenerate fast. His name is Amon, right? Yes. Selene loved Amon. She wanted to see him again. - Why did you know where I was? - Because I'm a demon. You are not a demon. You haven't killed someone. So I'm not a human anymore, I'm a demon. Demons don't cry, Akira. These demons, why do they take our bodies? Because they are actually weak. To survive, they must possess... other creatures and overtake their DNA. If a demon is dominating a bird, can he fly then? Yes. You saved me from her. I consider that as my fate. Fate? I became Devilman to guard the humans. To guard Miki and the others. That's the only way I can bear that. I'm sorry. Never mind. My fate will be fulfilled. There you are. Where were you? Blood! What happened? Drop it! Akira, you somehow changed. How? I don't know... - Miki, don't you like the way I am now? - Sure. Really? I like you even more. I want to eat. Eat! Everyone listen! Whoever is buying such a turtle, will become a doctor, a minister or a mayor. Creatures mustn't be killed by no means, but eat. Not kill, but eat. Not kill, eat! Help! Help... Ushiku! Ushiku! Help! Akira! Where are you? Help... Ushiku? I was devoured by them. - Me, too. - Me, too! I always wanted to be friends with you. Now we finally are friends, but I'm dead. I would still like to be alive. I'm Jinmen. Who are you? You devoured my friend. I'll show you! We are already dead. Our faces... are the last image of our consciousness. They also... will disappear soon. Farewell, Akira! I will never forget you! Eat! In a short while ou will die, Jinmen! Why do you kill me? You are a demon, too? Demons don't kill one another! I'm not a demon. I'm Devilman! I'm a human, like the ones you killed! I haven't killed them, only eaten. Humans also eat animals. I have only eaten the humans. I'm not like Satan. Satan? He wants to annihilate all humans, but I'm not like him. I'm not like him. I just wanted to eat. That's all. Satan? "Actually, I'm the devil", that is what Ryo said before he cut off my fingers. Akira, beware of Ryo! And now please save the HTML-pages. That's it for today. Alright, until next week. Hello, Miki. Miko, what's the matter? - I was worried, you were absent for so long. - I couldn't come. What do you want? Didn't you quit with school? You aren't wearing school uniform. Tell me, are you probably the demon they are reporting about on TV? Shouldn't we better examine your body? Miko? - Show us. Come one, let's take off her clothes! - Stop it! Beat it! - You will be really sorry about that! - Stop it immediately! Beat it! Go away! Leave us alone! Demon! Miko... All students stay in their classrooms. No one is leaving the building. Stop, stay right there! - Where do you want to go? - Let go! - Sit down again! - I don't want to stay here! - Akira! - Miss Makimura! - Is everything okay? - I'm fine, but... When they called her demon, she cried. So, it doesn't matter how she is looking like,... she isn't a demon. This shocking pictures just came in from Los Angeles. Unbelievable, it is a demon! Look! Get closer! Record his face! Get closer, can you see him? Can I also swing? Alright. - Don't you have to go home? - My mother scares me. Fear? She is so changed. She sure is killing me someday. - Didn't you tell your father? - Yes. He isn't believing me. When Dad is at home, Mum is doing something to me. Susumu? I was worried because you didn't come. Come on, let's go. - I would like to play with her a little longer. - You are disturbing her. Dad is already waiting for you at home. We shouldn't let him wait so long. Really? Alright, then we go. Bye Bye, big sis'. Good-bye. Let's go. - Dad! - Welcome home. Let them be. They are only scum anyway. I couldn't help Ushiku. What's the purpose of being Devilman, when I can't save anyone? Let go! Do what you want, Idiot! Die! Die, demon! Ryo? Susumu... Aren't you scared of me? No. But you saved me. I thank you. Tell me what happened? A colleague of mine... was arrested from the Demon-Commando. According to paragraph we are allowed to arrest every suspect. - If the suspect... - I'm not a demon! defies to his arrest,... the special commando is authorized, according to paragraph 23, to shoot the demon. - Do not resist! - If you help him, you will also be considered as a demon. I'm not a demon! He was a strange guy, but a good worker. A colleague, with whom he often argued, denunciated him. - Is he really no demon? - No. I don't believe that you can differ between humans and demons... in the current situation. That means, humans are considered as demons with no reason? Exactly. If someone calls you a demon, you are already lost. We live in a dangerous time. Why did we got arrested? NO ADMITTANCE! SCHOOL CLOSED KAWAMOTO SHOJI, SANAE AND MIKO That's the place where Miko used to live. Hey, you can't park here! Wait, watch out! In this house a demon is appeared. The people moved away. No one's living here anymore. You... aren't friends of them? Don't touch me! Don't dare touching me! - Good Day, padre. - Good Day. What's that? I wanted that you attach that to your cell phone. Isn't it cute? What is so cute about it? I don't want such an ugly thing. Hmm, you find it ugly. Actually, you're right. - Akira, don't you want pray? - For what did you pray? For being able to celebrate our wedding here one day. I prayed for our wedding. And that we will get many children... and become a happy family someday. I really hope that. Children... Don't you want any? Sure, but all that is still so far away from now. I can't really imagine that. Let's go. - Akira, come with me. - Where? Just come. Hurry up. We don't have any time. Today, the special commando discovered an imporant base of the demons... and initiated investigations. If a demon gets caught, he will be shot. It starts now. What are you planning? I will kill these humans. I will annihilate them. Come with me, Akira. Don't do it! Can you forgive such humans? Alright. Satan, help me please. Satan? Satan! Long live the demons! Long live the demons... ALL DEMONS SHOT AT RAID - These are real good rifles. - I immediately need a weapon! Don't shoot! Help! - Come on, turn into a demon! - I'm a human! The humans interpreted every little anomaly as a sign of the demon... - and attacked each other at random. - Demons! No, let go of me! The panic even led so far, that nations attacked each other. Uncle! I forgot. Thank you. Mother is sending you to me with that, right? Are you alone? Your aunt is being worried about you. No one is coming into the test-lab anymore. But... someone has to take care of the plants. Anyway, I don't have anything else to do. And I like to take care of them. I help you. Does Miki know of that? That does not change anything for me. I still stand by your side. Miki will think the same about that. Father... Let's keep going on. Uncle, watch out! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Ryo! You are still alive! I'm Satan, right? When will this war end? What do you think? I don't know. What's up? I thought... Can you honestly answer me a question? Yes. What is it? Akira, do you believe in god? Is there a god? Yes, sure. God is near us. Akira, do you think we will survive that? I will protect you. Even when the world is going down, I will protect you. Demons on the run! A demon escaped from Zone 5, Cell 36. Shoot him immediately! Demon! Susumu! Where should we go, Miko? Miko! I'm sorry. I don't have anyone else I can refer to. I am only a demon, my life is not important. But this boy is a human. Please save him. You can come inside, too. Delicious. My father grew this rice. Father, mother, please. Do you mind if they stay here for the moment? - Not at all. - We don't let them down. Thank you. So, you saved the boy? I find that admirable. Thank you. Alright, you can stay here. I'm sorry. I... I'm even not a human. I'm so disgusting. Sure, you are a human. Exactly like before. It is a good feeling,... to be beautiful, isn't it? Although everyone is doing so, you don't enter the self-defense-troop? Maybe there are demons near here. We have to become active by ourselves... and find them. I tell you, this is a matter of the police. There are also demons with the police! You can't rely on them. Do you perhaps have a demon in your family, who you want to protect? Father... Maybe we were betrayed. You should run away right now. The key of the test-lab, no one's there at the moment. You can hide there, until I fetch you up. I will never forget what you have done for me. - Let's go, Susumu. - Wait. Please. And this is also for you. The riceballs were really delicious. Thank you so much. I will go out now. Freeze! - What do you want? - You will die! Search the house, the have to be here! - You are a demon! - That's a mistake! Where do you hide them? These demons? They aren't inside this house. Where are they? Where did you hide the demons? I don't know what you are talking about. You want to protect the demons? Aha! I understand. Maybe you are demons by yourselves. What are you looking at? - You are one? Yes, you are a demon. I will kill you. - Nein! - She isn't a demon, but I am. - No, I am! Step to the side or I will shoot you all! I'm the only one who is not a human. That's not true. Akira is a human. He is a human! I thank you, Miki. I surely come back to you. Now step to the side. I have fear that we will never see each other again. Arrest him. He is dead. This house is a demon nest! - A demon nest! - We kill them all! Destroy the demons! Kill them! They all don't have any idea. What should we do Mr. Ueda? Only the boy was a demon. Miki doesn't have anything to do with it. - But they will kill Miki, too. What should we do now? - That's not my problem. That's not of my concern. I can't reach the police. I just wanted to get rid of the boy! Miki, go upstairs and hide yourself. No, I will fight together with you. We are your parents. For you, we even would become demons. Akira will surely come to save you. - Kill them! - Kill the demons! - Can I ask you something? - What is it? - Did you ever cheat on me? What a question! No, I never cheated on you. There was always only you. Even if you are lying, thank you. There they are! Akira... Over there. Over there they are! It is useless to run away, you don't have any chance! According to paragraph 43 of the demon-law, demons in childshape are a danger to mankind. They must be killed immediately! There is still someone upstairs. Here I am. If you are humans, I am a witch. Now I got you. I am a witch. Better run off! Shoot! Susumu, forgive me. Who are you? It's me, Miko. You are beautiful,... Miko. Not we are the evil ones, the humans are the destructive monsters! Uncle, aunt! - Hello, Akira! - Hello! Uncle... Aunt... I'm a witch. Better run off! Now I got you. No. I'm not a witch. Father... Mother... I'm sorry. I didn't manage it to survive. Akira... Miki... Miki, here we are. I prayed for our wedding. That we will get many children... and become a happy family someday. I really hope that. Did you find god? Was it worthwhile to protect the humans, Akira? Ryo! You were Satan right from the beginning. You deceived me all the time! I didn't deceive you. I just don't like the humans. But I alwas liked you. I wanted you to live. That's the reason you became a demon. Please, Akira, live together with me in the new world. New World? I wanted to build up a world for the demons. But the humans were much too numerous. No matter how many demons I let revive,... it was impossible to destroy the humans. But then, something happened I didn't imagine: The humans began to kill one another... and to annihilate one another. The humans are like foolish animals. They have destroyed themselves. That was really funny. Kill me! What's the purpose of letting me live? It was just... for Miki... for uncle... and aunt... that I wanted to keep living. Because we were all together. Humans can't live alone. I don't understand. I thought so. The foolish animal is you, Satan! The mankind will soon go down. Come with me to the new world. No! I'm not a demon. I'm Devilman! I will kill you. So it is. Then I unfortunately must kill you! You will die, Satan! You are the one who will die. I won't loose. Die, Satan! Finished! If it will be destroyed by someone tomorrow? It would be nice if it will keep standing here. Yes. Forever and ever. Akira... Ryo. What is it? You won't die, or? You are Devilman. You must live. When you survive,... then I'm fine. No matter, where you are going,... I will follow you. Wait for me,... Akira. He smiles. Akira smiled. Miko! Why are you looking like that? I looked into my heart. There were the blue sky,... the beautiful ocean... and the green woods. They were unlimited. Such places don't exist anymore. We must survive. Even we are the only ones, we have to survive. That, I have promised to... Miki.
