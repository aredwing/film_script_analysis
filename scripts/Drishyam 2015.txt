Are you a police officer? - Yes. Here it is. Right in front of us. It was inaugurated just last week. - I see. The faded one right next to it is the old police station. Okay, thanks. All the police officers have breakfast here. Some of them eat breakfast, lunch and dinner right here. I see. Come over, after duty hours. I'll serve you chilled beer and fried fish. Let's see. Excuse me. Who's the Senior PI? Who are you? - Satish Naik. I have been transferred here. Sir, do come in. You're welcome. Have a seat. Sir will be here, soon. Listen. Isn't that Vijay Salgaonkar? Yes, sir. That's him. He seems to be pretty straight forward. But, appearances can be deceptive, sir. What do you mean? - I mean, what he's done... ...is still pretty unbelievable. Vijay, sir. Get him, get him. Hey, hey, hey. Go. That was an awesome chase, sir! Awesome? They've edited it with fast cuts and taken the audience for a ride. On top of that, the music is pounding away! So that it seems as if a lot is going on. But, nothing is really happening. You need to feel the tension. Feel it! Mr. Vijay, I have an idea. You know, you should make a movie. I mean, then the world will see that you... I'll show it to you, first. - No! Mr. Vijay! No! Sorry, sir! Are you done with the collections? Yes, I'm done. Here, look. As always, Inspector Gaitonde cribbed a bit. And, uncle Pinto's TV is flickering. That's a problem with his TV. It's not a cable issue. Tell him to buy a new one. - You bet, I did! Then? - . That's what he called you. - And you let him abuse me? No, no, I didn't! I told him. I said, if you want to abuse Mr. Vijay... ...say something logical. You can call him uneducated, illiterate, 4th grade dropout... ...call him an orphan. But, ? No, never. Am I right? Or am I right? Alright, then! - Listen to me. You're absolutely right. I'll give you a bonus. - A bonus! Mr. Vijay, no! Sir, no! He's waiting for SI Gaitonde. Why? - Don't ask. He locked up his only son in prison. What did he do? Nothing. He took a loan from a private finance company. He used to pay all the installments on time. He just wasn't able to pay the final installment. Mr. Gaitonde took my son away, two days ago. Now, the finance company is also saying... ...that, the installment has to be paid with interest, first. That's when they'll let my son go. Why is Gaitonde taking such an interest in this? Because, his cousin runs the finance company. So, did you complain to Mr. Prabhu? Mr. Gaitonde told me... ...if I complain to anyone at all... ...then, he will kill my son. Anyway, what's the point of complaining? Then, file a lawsuit in the court. On whom? His son wasn't locked up by the finance company... ...Gaitonde did that. 'There is only one way to get your brother out.' 'What's that? - Habeas corpus.' I'll tell you what to do. Habeas corpus. What? Hibbus... Habeas corpus. It's a legal term. How will that help? His son will get released, because... 'This is not an ordinary case.' 'This is a case involving habeas corpus.' And if they tell the court... ...that someone has locked up his son illegally... ...then, the court will order the police to at once... ...present the man in the court.' Then, Gaitonde or the senior PI or IG, can't ignore the court's order. The police will not present him in the court. Because Gaitonde locked him up illegally. Why don't you do this? I know a lawyer in Panaji. Shirish Kamath. I'll give you his number. Tell him, this is a matter concerning Habeas corpus. I will speak to him, too. Speak of the devil and the devil appears! He's coming this way. You have to get out of here. Leave, by the back door. Hey, Martin! - Hmm. Did an old couple come here? Not at all. - Where the heck did they go? What do you think? Are you the only one who can act? Today, I have managed to act, somehow. I love you, dad. Come on, and wipe your tears, dad. Here's the handkerchief. Wipe your tears! You now carry a handkerchief in your pocket? Sumi! I don't have to worry about anything! Your son is very responsible, now. - Mr. Vijay. Mr. Vijay! Mr. Vijay, can I go home? It's really late. Thank you. Hello? Mirage Cable. Yes, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes, I'll do that. I'll do it. Right away! Yes. Yes! Seems you received quiet a drubbing. What is it? Actually, it's aunt Saldanha... ...the amplifier near her place is not working. So I am... You just changed that three days ago. I forgot about that. That's nice, you deserve the drubbing. I am going there, at once. What else did you forget? Hello, I... I... Yes, done, done. Mr. Shirodkar who is 75 years old has a request. Screen a nice, adult movie, today. But, wasn't he paralyzed? Come on, Mr. Vijay! His left side is paralyzed. Whereas Shirodkar is right handed. Get lost! Scat! - No, I'm going. We can't lose, dad. We have to win. I love you, dad. My son. Good morning. - Good morning. How are the studies coming along? - Doing fine. Where is mom? - In the kitchen. Where are the keys to the vault? Tell me the truth! Which vault? I really don't know. Let me go, please. Who knows, if you don't? Vijay. - Who's Vijay? The man who's threatening me with a carrot. And, it seems, he hasn't even bathed, yet. You're reeking of sweat. I would bathe, if you heat the water. Check in the bathroom. It's already there. You come too. - Get away! Naughty! Go! So, where's Miss India? She's probably rehearsing her cat walk in front of the mirror. Anu! - I'll be right there, mom. Good morning, dad. - Good morning. I was calling you last night. But, I couldn't get through. Did the phone die on you again? - Yes. Why don't you buy a cell phone? What's the use? That place is out of range. Really? So, how does Jose get the range on his mobile? It's not like that. You want an excuse to be away from us. The three of us stay here alone and you are... One moment. Since there are three of you, you're not alone. Don't crack silly jokes. You'd rather sit in office and watch movies than come home. You don't have any sense of responsibility towards us. You should consider us, at least. Okay, fine. What do you want? My darling wife! Speak up! We want to go to Panaji. Why? For shopping. We just went shopping, six months ago. Yes, we did shop. You bought the cheapest clothes, to save money. Their colors have faded, within six months. So, this time, let's shop here, instead of going to Panaji. No! We want to go to Panaji. We don't just want to shop. We also want to watch a movie. And we want to eat a pizza too. And ice cream? - Yes, ice cream, too! People do all sorts of things for their family. What do you do? You can't even buy us an ice cream! Don't be so absurd! You can buy ice cream at Martin's too! What's so special about Panaji? You're denying our wishes. Correct? Majority wins and you're still saying no! We shall see. I didn't say no. I just asked. Does that mean, we're going to Panaji? Yes. - Are you sure? This Sunday, we are going to Panaji. Happy? " What is it about you, life?" " What is it about you, life?" " Am I a copy of you?" " Or, do you reflect me?" " What is it about you, life?" " What is it about you, life?" " You are clinging to me." " You tickle my soles." " You are a little irritable." " You are slightly arrogant." " You argue with me." " Let's meet little further down the road." " What is it about you, life?" There's a nature camp, the next week. And, two students from each school in Goa are selected. And, I've been selected from my school. That's really nice. Yes, but.. I've told her, she can't go. Why? She should go for a nature camp. Nandini, real knowledge is not found only in books. You have to visit new places for that. You have to meet different kinds of people. You have to experience new things. In that case, why don't you pay the fees? The fees? - Rs. 1800. I think, real knowledge is found only in books. What? You just said yes! You can't go back on your word. Please, let me do this. Please? Okay, fine. - Thank you! " A frown comes along in the middle of a laugh." " Just let me catch my breath." " All the autumn leaves will fall away." " Let me understand this." " A bit of a firecracker." " A bit sprightly and teasing." " You are a chain that ties me down." " Why don't you turn back to me, some time?" " What is it about you, life?" " What is it about you, life?" " What is it about you, life?" " Am I a copy of you?" " Or, do you reflect me?" Mr. Vijay! It's been so long! How are you, Rajesh? - Fine. How's the social work going on? - Well... There's more politics than social work involved. Right. Our group has established a political party. The Goa Jana Party. I'm working on that. What's that in your hand? There is a stone quarry about 15 kms away in Paavelim. I mean, it was there, earlier. We shut it down after protesting against it. Why? - The project is not eco friendly. There is a lake right in the middle of the quarry. Have a look. Alright, I've got to leave. See you. - Bye Sis! So, as I was saying... ...the girls are growing up. They are smart, too. They should get into a good school. For example.. - St. Thomas. St. Thomas. I've heard very good things about that school. From whom? From Nandini, right? Yes, I told her. So what? I knew it. Only you can come up with such an uneducated idea. Who are you calling uneducated? I'm more educated than you. Right, you've got a doctorate. I admit, I only studied till the tenth grade. But at least, I cleared the exams! I didn't fail in the fourth grade, like you. That's where you're wrong. Clearing papers doesn't teach you everything. What? - You bet! Once, it took me four whole hours to explain to her... ...that, Sonu Nigam's brother isn't called Telephone Nigam. She just wouldn't believe me. Just keep quiet! You always.. Listen, please don't get into another fight the both of you! And you don't need to go to St. Thomas to know all that. At least, don't scrimp when it comes to education. I'm not scrimping. I'm being sensible. It's not necessary everything that is expensive is good. Besides, those who really wish to study... ...can study at any school and make it big. What do you say, Father(in-law)? Am I right? Yes, my son. You're absolutely right. Right. Get it moving, quickly. Hello, Rane! - Hello, uncle Martin! How are you? Okay. - What brings you here? So, the work has begun. - Yes, it'll be done, soon. Are you done with the collections? Yes, you bet! What about D'costa and Bandodkar's complaints? Yes, I'm on my way there. Then, leave! - Of course, I'll go. I really want you to leave! - Yes. Let me finish my special tea. Where is it? - Here... Peter! Hey, Peter! Where's my special tea? You! - No, no! Behind you, sir! I'm leaving! Hey! - Crazy! Is he crazy? What's the matter, Vijay? He's getting too smart for his own good. Forget about it. He's a kid. Listen, Mr. Rane, this is Mr. Vijay Salgaonkar. He owns Mirage Cable. - Really? That's nice. This is contractor Rane. He is working on the construction of the police station. Okay, okay. Do come in. After you. - Sit down. Uncle Martin said you need to get some odd jobs done. I have a... - Hey, Martin! I asked you if that old couple came over the other day. You said no. You think I am some...? I know, they came here. Some smart chap taught them a few legal lessons. What the heck! What are you saying? I don't remember anything. Really? So, your memory is failing. Or, are you trying to protect that wise guy? Listen, I'm an old man. Right. Old man. So, Vijay. Do you remember the old couple? Which old couple? Hey, Peter? What's on the menu today? The usual. What is this, uncle? You should have a today's special! I'm fed up of eating the same food, every day. What to do, son? I am bored, too. - See? But normally, my customers pay for their meals later. Some of them, even eat free of cost. Right. For example, Vijay. I don't pay for my meals, later. I clear my bills every week. So, that means you're taunting me, uncle. No, no! Just talking in general. No, let's settle your account today. Why do you keep going on and on about money? What will you do with all that money? I'll put a today's special on the menu. Really? How much do I owe you? Forget about it, sir. Forget it. Take it, uncle. When a cop offers to pay, you should take it at once. Just keep your nose out of this. Cheeky fellow! We're having it out, here. So, how much do I owe you? Don't feel shy, tell me. Rs. 3542. So, you remember that number really well! But, you don't remember that old couple! I write my accounts down, you see. Okay, fine. Rs. 3542. That's it?! Cheapskate! Rs. 3600. Let's make it a round figure. I'm going to settle it, right away. Uncle, let's just assume... ...you've paid me Rs. 3600 as commission. What's the commission for? Don't you see that right in front? The new police station is being constructed. So, all the workers from there... ...come here to eat food. Why? Thanks to me. Look at that! Contractor Rane is sitting here, too. What's up, Rane? I have given you so many customers... ...so, I should get paid a commission for that, uncle. These days, at our police station... ... we are observing 'the police is your friend' week. The police really know how to eat well. At least, work out a bit. What's your problem? There is no other hotel around here, except this one. That's why the construction workers come here to eat. You're not needed for that. I am a cop. I can stop them from coming here. Hello, Martin! - Hello, sir. Peter, get Mr. Sawant some coffee. Vijay, how are you doing? We were working out a deal. We just settled on the commission. What's the commission for? For the meals of the construction workers at the new police station. Who's taking a commission? Mr. Sawant, coffee. Yes. Mr. Sawant, I know, I should not be saying this. What's the meaning of the police is your friend week? It's the duty of the police to be friendly and help the public. Then, why is it being done for a week, in the whole year? You're right, Vijay. But, until the people are scared to file complaints, it's impossible. That's why, we're doing all this. It will sort itself out, gradually. But, all police officers aren't like you, sir. Some are big, black bed bugs... ...who can only feed off other people's blood. What are you doing? I'm digging a pit for the compost. You know what? Compost and speed post are 2 different things. I know what compost means. If you bury dry leaves and organic garbage for six months... ...it turns into fertilizer. I learnt that in school. I just came to tell you that... ...next weekend on 2nd and 3rd October... ...Swami Chinmayanand is holding sermons in Panaji. So? - So, we should go! It's been a year since we heard him preach. - You go ahead. Either we go together, or nobody does. - Mom! I won't spare you! Mom can't save you. - Mom! Come here. - Mom! No! Come here. - Anju. We spent so much to send you on a nature camp. You didn't tell us about it. It was great fun! There were students from 40 schools. We went sightseeing, had a bonfire, we sang songs. And we had a lot of fun. There were kids from VIP families too. One of them was called Sam. He used to keep shooting videos of girls with his phone. Did he shoot you, too? Yes. - Why didn't you complain? Later, an advocate's daughter scolded him. Then, he stopped it. Which school was he from? St. Thomas. Is this an old construction? - Yes. No wonder the foundation has crumbled. Don't worry, it will get done. It's just a day's work. Then, do it whenever you have time. - Okay. The slab laying work at the police station is done. I have to start the flooring from Monday. So, once that's done, we'll get this done. Okay? Okay, thank you. I would have taken the money from any other guy. Mr. Rane, I'm sorry. I have taken your money. I will pay it back gradually. Just give me a few days. What the heck, Rane? You think, you're too smart! Did you get taken in by some uneducated fool? Do you think, you'll be safe if you complain to Mr. Prabhu about me? The money I have taken from you... ...included his cut, too. Do you get that? He complained about me! If you do that, again, I'll make sure you pack up! Who are you threatening? I know Mr. Prabhu really well. He isn't like you. Why are you asking me? I don't have to ask, we all know you. Listen, Vijay. I've had enough of your sass. Just zip it. - Why should I? Everyone knows you feed off more on money, than you eat food. What the heck... - Hey, Gaitonde! Stop! Okay, okay. Let me go. Let go! I won't spare you, Vijay. We will settle up later. I'll have my day. Every dog has his day. He came so defiantly, but, he's leaving like a mouse! Vijay, don't get into trouble over me. I will do the job and leave. He's going to harass you later for no reason. Vijay, Gaitonde is a cop. He has power. Don't mess with him. I didn't mess with him. And I didn't lie. Why are we so scared of cops? They are meant to serve us and not the other way around. " When the clouds rain down... ...I look at you to my heart's content." " You are a prayer for rain, to me." Very good. " Let me stay in your arms... ...let me go crazy for you" . " Let me suffer whatever you have to give me, my love." 451 . Jose. - Hmm. I've got a headache. I'm going home. Understood? Okay. - He doesn't understand a thing. If it's Sunny Leone, you're bound to get a headache. Dr. Joshi... Rascal! He understands everything. Sometimes, I wonder. Okay so, who made you wonder today? Let's go in, I'll tell you. No, tell me or I won't let you in. Come on, you can't do that. - Tell me. Sunny Leone? Right? Jism 2 or Jackpot? Jackpot. You're now a dad, but you still act like a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm young. Good morning, dad. - Good morning. Good morning. Dad, did you come home, last night? Yes, dear. - Why? Anu, don't ask nosy questions. Why? Dad comes home, very rarely, so I asked. Don't ask too many questions. Don't you have to go to school? You're not even wearing your uniforms, yet. Come on, dad! How could you forget? What? - It's a holiday, today. Did the school declare that, or did you do that? Our daughters make excuses expertly. It's Sunday tomorrow. Why do you have a holiday today? It's Gandhi Jayanti today. So? Go and study. No, dad. I am going to play. These kids... Won't you bathe, today? I don't want to. So, who's going to work? I don't know. I ran out of stamina yesterday. I mean, that... ...my bike broke down on the way. So, I had to push it home. I got tired. Anju. I'll give you a list. Get some things from the market. Okay. Can I go in the evening, please? Alright, but don't forget. Anju. Remember me? It's Sam. Yes, I do. But, what are you doing here? Me? I came to meet you. Me? - Hmm. Why? Finish it. Okay? - Hmm. See who's at the door. - Okay. Hi, Anju. Don't worry. I didn't show this video to anyone. In fact, I'm thinking of deleting it. You want that, too, right? Great! Make my wish come true. Tonight at 1 1 pm, behind your house. You'll meet me, right? No! I won't come there. I didn't show this video to anyone. Not even my friends. I didn't forward it or think of uploading it on the net. But, just think about it. What if I do all that? What about your family's reputation? Sam, please, Sam! Please, delete this video. Why are you hassling me? Please! I will do it. Tonight at 1 1 pm. Behind your house. Alone. Alright? I'll see you. - No, Sam! I'll see you. - Sam! Sam, please! Sam! Sam! What is it? I've a slight headache. Do you want some medicine? No. I'll be fine, once I lie down for a bit. Eat something. It's almost dinner time. Run! Run! - No! Run! It seems, a storm is coming. Hey, don't jinx it! I'm leaving. Got an umbrella? - Yes. Anju, you shouldn't have done this. I guess, you aren't taking me seriously. Sam, please! Don't harass me anymore. Please, delete the video. - Should I delete it? You cheated me. - No, Sam. Just you wait. Why are you doing this? We didn't harm you in any way. I request you... ...don't ruin her life. It's no use, now. She was ruined the day I shot this video. You've seen it today. Soon, everyone on the internet will watch it. They'll know how she bathes. I request you. Please delete it. I won't do that. Don't you have any shame? Delete it. - No. Please, delete it. I told you, I won't do it. I beg you. Please, delete it. We'll be ruined! Please! Alright. I will delete the video. But, you must give me what I want. What? Anju. Nandini! Anju! An... Dad! Anju, what happened? Anju? Nandini, what happened? Why doesn't someone tell me? I will delete the video. But, you must give me... ...what I want. Or, I will... ...upload this video online. Anju! Anju! Anju, he's not breathing! Sam! Sam! Sam? What happened? - Mom, I can't get through to dad. I guess, the line is dead... Let's go. Come with me. Anju, get the spade. What will we do, now? I don't know. I don't know how I got the courage, to bury him. But, I'm shaking all over, now. Did I make a mistake by burying him? No. You did the right thing. No... if we had informed the police at once... ...we wouldn't feel scared. If we'd gone to the police... ...Anju's life would be ruined. I'm really scared! Don't be scared. I won't let anything happen to you. See what I found in the outhouse. Did Sam have a car? Yes, he had a yellow car. He must have parked it nearby. Have you checked the outhouse, properly? No. - No. Let's go. Where did Sam fall when you hit him? Right there. What are you searching for? Blood. There's not a single drop of blood here. When you hit him with the stick, did you hit his head? Perhaps, it's an internal injury. We have to clean the outhouse, thoroughly. Just a moment. Trace it, quickly! As soon as the SIM card is put in... Trace it fast. - Trace the location of the SIM card. Find out where he's travelling. - We are getting the signal. It's really easy to trace his SIM now. I've traced it, sir. He's talking from the second floor. - And he's travelling to Pune. Sir, if he speaks for five minutes, we'll have the exact location. The SIM card has been activated. So, the exact location... Trace the SIM card. - Sir, it's within a half... ...kilometer radius. I guess he threw the mobile away. Sir, he's traveling via Rajasthan to Haryana. Don't leave the house until I get back. Don't call anyone. Keep the doors and windows locked. It should appear as if no one is at home. Where are you going? I have to find the car and take it somewhere else. Get back, soon. Anju! - I didn't mean to kill Sam. I was just trying to break his phone. But, he didn't let go... - I know. I know! I don't want to go to prison! Please. Are you crazy? I'm still alive. I won't let you go to jail. Nothing will happen to you. Salvi, stop counting and give all of that to me. Is that all you've got? Sir, isn't Rs. 500 enough? It's not for a driver's license. This is for passport verification. You want to go to London to meet your son, right? How much for you? - Sir, it's fifty five. Do you think, it's raining money? Fifty five, it seems! Here, that's thirty. Get going. Alright, then. Get me a gift from London. What the heck? Who is it? Isn't that Vijay Salgaonkar? It seems to be. When did he buy a car? Where does he live? His garden is across the road. Mom. We'll be in big trouble, because of me. Right? Don't say that. We are with you. You don't know, whose son he was. Whose son was he? Listen, I wanted to tell you... ...on the next weekend on the 2nd and 3rd of October... ...Swami Chinmayanand is holding a sermon at Panaji. Come on, now! Hey, move it! Yes, sir? - Can I buy a phone? A new one? - No, a used phone. Sure. Please make sure the battery is fully charged. - Sure. Here you are, sir. How much for this? - Rs. 900. Here you are. - Could you put the SIM card in? Here you are, sir. - Thank you. How do I reduce the volume? Here. It's done, sir. - Thank you. You're welcome. There is a stone quarry, about 15 kms away in Paavelim. I mean, it used to be there. We got it shut down, after protesting against it. There is a lake right in the middle of it. But, the project is not eco friendly. It's you! I thought, you'd taken a holiday. What happened, today? Nothing much. I collected the payments. As always, Mrs. Pereira avoided making the payment. Okay, listen to me. I am not here for 2 days. I am going to Panaji for a sermon. Sermons? Nandini really wants to go. We are leaving, tomorrow. Take care of things. Mr. Vijay. Anything wrong? Not at all. Why? Well, you just seem slightly 'off'. That's all. Not at all! But, if I find out, that you've messed up... ...l'll rub you out! Now, that's more like you. Get lost. Don't screen too many adult films. Sure. Who is it? It's Vijay. Don't cry, dear. I'm back. Dad, don't ever leave me again. I won't. Vijay. Sam was the son of the IG of Goa. Inspector General of Police. You're lying! Tell me! Patil! Senior Inspector D'souza. And Inspector Mohite. These are the name of the suspended officers. Because of whom? The court warned the police department. They may set up an enquiry, too. Because of whom? The murderer in this case is roaming scot free. Because of whom? Because, both of you testified in court... ...that, the police forced you to make a statement. Do you think, the police department is a joke? And you can do anything you want? I want you to give another statement. This time, make it the truth. No, ma'am. Ma'am, they will kill us. They will kill you and so you won't testify. And so, both my officers will stay under suspension. Patil. - Yes, Madam. Did anyone see you when you fetched them? No, Madam. We were in civil clothes. Alright, then. String them both up with a noose around their necks. Anchor them with a heavy stone and toss them into the sea. No one will know. The corpses won't be found. I won't waste my time on them. No, ma'am! Ma'am. We'll tell the truth. Ma'am, they are innocent. We will tell the truth. Patil, when they come to testify in the court... ...bring in their families. Okay, Madam. If they give a false testimony, maim their families. I don't care. Why are you smiling? Aren't you tensed? - About what? That boy... Which boy? Sam. - Who's Sam? The one who... - Just a moment. I don't know anyone called Sam. And no boy entered this house. From now on, we are going to react just like that. As if nothing happened. Or the fear and tension may cause problems for us. I just realized that a while back. Before I arrived home, I went to the office. Jose asked me if anything was wrong. If Jose can figure out something is wrong in a few moments... ...then, others can figure it out, too. But, when I answered him as I normally do, he was assured. So, forget what happened. Behave as if nothing has happened. Everything is normal. What did you do about the car? I won't tell you stuff... ...that you don't need to know about. Don't even try to find out. Pack your bags. We leave tomorrow morning. Where to? We have to stay somewhere else for two days. It'll be a good change and help us relax. If anyone asks you where we're going, tell them... ...we are going to attend Swami Chinmayanand's sermon. But, that got over today. Hello! - Hi, Mahesh. Are you going back or... - Yes, I'll freshen up and go back. Meera, did you speak to Sam? I've been trying to call since last night. His phone is switched off. You call him constantly and bother him, Mahesh. So, he must have switched it off on purpose. That's nice. You're scolding me for all my trouble. You've allowed him to take too many liberties. Mahesh, kids want freedom at this age. We must give it to them. Freedom? How much freedom does he want? We have given him everything. A phone, laptop, 2 credit cards, a car. Why does he need all that? Have you seen last month's credit card bill? Rs. 60,000. Yes, that's because, he bought a new laptop. And I've seen the receipt. Why does he need another laptop? How does the receipt matter? Did you see the laptop? I haven't seen it. Mahesh, stop doubting your son so much. He'll run away forever, some day. I don't doubt him. I worry about him, Meera. You're pampered him to such an extent that... Sorry. I'm getting late. Okay? If you speak to him, tell him to come home. Okay? Bye Meera. - Bye. Alright, tickets, please. Mr. Salgaonkar! Are you going on a trip with the family? Did you buy a new bus? No, it's a used bus. - It's nice. Where are you off to? We are going to attend our spiritual guru's sermon at Panaji. Give me four tickets. - What's wrong with you? I can't let you pay for tickets on my bus. Put it away. - Thank you. Alright, tickets, please! Tickets! " Dying every moment..." " ...living for the moment." " Barely alive..." " It's stifling..." " It's stifling..." " I'm in pain." " It's stifling..." " Fear picks at my mind." " It's stifling..." " Dying every moment, living for the moment." " Barely alive..." " It's stifling..." " It's stifling..." " It's stifling..." " My lips ravaged, I can barely speak." " Bloodless limbs, my body is drifting aimlessly." " The tears caught up in my heart..." " ...my eyes glaze over with tears." " It's stifling..." " It's stifling..." " It's stifling..." " Why do I feel someone watching me from a distance?" " Did anyone come near me?" " Does my shadow follow me?" " But, my heart beat is subdued." " Barely breathing..." " It's stifling..." " It's stifling..." " My breath catches ever so slightly." " It's stifling..." " Why is every moment stifling me?" " It's stifling..." " It's stifling..." What did I say to you? I know, but I can't seem to forget. You have to forget. Our fear is the one last piece of evidence of what happened. We have to get rid of that as well. And there's just one more thing. Get a bill for everything you buy, from now on. Groceries, vegetables, fruits, pencils. Get bills for the most trivial things. " It is stifling..." " It is stifling..." " My breath catches ever so slightly." " It is stifling..." " Why is every moment stifling me?" " It is stifling..." Let me speak to Kanvinde from the cyber cell. " It is stifling..."

" Dying every moment, living for the moment." Ma'am, we followed Sam's network from Goa, Hublidarbar, Chittadurg... ...Bengaluru, to Tamil Nadu and we lost trace in Kanchipuram. After that, his phone was switched off. He has friends in Bengaluru and Chennai. Yes, perhaps, he went there. But, why did the phone get switched off in Kanchipuram? " It is stifling..." " Why do I feel someone watching me from a distance?" " Did anyone come near me?" " Does my shadow follow me?" " But, my heart beat is subdued." " Barely breathing..." " It's stifling..." " It's stifling..." " It is stifling..." " It is stifling..." " It is stifling..." ACP Rego. Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, we just found the car here. Who saw it, first? A few kids who were swimming here, found it. How many days, do you reckon? It's been about 2 weeks. Excuse me, did you find anything in the lake? No, sir. Don't worry. When the car was dumped, it was empty. Don't let this get to the media. Wrap it up. The last call from Sam's mobile... ...was made on 2nd October at 07: 12 pm. The signal indicates, that it was located in Pondolem. His phone went out of coverage at 10:30 pm. The next morning... ...his phone was switched on once again at Panaji at 9:25 am. After that, the phone went to Kanchipuram. Where it was switched off. Ma'am, given the information we have so far, I think... ...we should confine our investigation to Goa. For the time being. Sam spoke to someone for the last time on 2nd October. Get me the details for that number. - Yes, ma'am. Yes? Send him in. Ma'am, the account number you gave us... ...was accessed at 10:00 am on 2nd October... ...at a cash ATM in Panaji. There is no transaction after that. How much cash was withdrawn? Rs. 20,000, sir. - Rs. 20,000? Why did he need so much money? Sir, there's more. The phone which went out of range on 2nd October... ...and the one which was switched on, the morning of 3rd October... ...are two different phones. The IMEl numbers are different. Ma'am, possibly he withdrew cash to buy a new cell phone. I don't think so. He bought a new cell phone just two months ago. I think, our son is in big trouble. Sir. Hey, you. What's this? The Panchayat building tax. I told you to pay that, right? When did I tell you? - It was... Three weeks ago. - Three weeks? Sameer Deshmukh, the only son of IG Meera Deshmukh. He's been missing since 3 weeks. According to the phone records, he was in Pondolem on 2nd October. This is the car, he drove in here. A yellow Hyundai Getz, GA07, MJ 101 1 . This car was recovered from the lake at Paavelim Stone Quarry. But, there is no sign of Sameer. If you are facing a problem, come to me and... What's up, Digambar? How is your son, now? - He's fine, sir. He will be discharged within a day or two. That's good. Give me Rs. 200. I don't have any money. What do you mean, you don't have money? The hospital isn't treating your son free of charge. No, no... - Come on, out with it. What's in that pocket? - It's nothing. Let's see it! Is that all? Fifty rupees? Get going. Martin, give me a packet of Pan Masala. What? The Pan masala? No tea for you today, Mr. Gaitonde? No, I don't have time for tea. I've been assigned to a major case. What is it about? A yellow Hyundai Getz car... ...was recovered from the lake in Paavelim stone quarry. That's in Paavelim, right? Why do you have to get involved? It's true but, I can't help it. The IG's office called, directly. The car belongs to the son of the IG, you see. The IG will obviously employ the entire police force to work. Mr. Sawant and I are working on this case together. I'll leave, now. What do you care? Mr. Sawant. What's wrong? Everything okay? - Yes, of course. Gaitonde, don't shoot your mouth off. Don't drag Vijay into this, just because you have issues with him. I saw him getting into the car. It's just... That's not all. A little while ago, I mentioned the car. He was disturbed. You'll see... ...even if he is slightly apprehensive, he will look back. He's going to turn, now. So, now what? You've lost it, Gaitonde. Vijay Salgaonkar and the IG's son, Sameer Deshmukh... What's the connection? Sir, Gaitonde and Vijay can't stand each other. That's why, Gaitonde is trying to implicate Vijay. Or he is mistaken. Sir. Sir, on the 3rd of this month at 7: 15 am... ...I went to Subhash Salvi's place for passport verification. I saw Vijay Salgaonkar there. I am absolutely sure. Where were you on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month? We went for a sermon to Panaji. When did you get back? - The next day, on a Sunday. At what time? - In the evening. Where was the sermon held? - In Panaji. Where, in Panaji? Patto... In Patto colony. Really? Was it in Patto colony? The hermitage is there. That's where the sermon was held. Vijay, what's going on? Will the police actually come here? Absolutely. We don't know when they will come. But, they will certainly come over. But, you don't have to worry. The police has no clues about Sam. And, they don't have any evidence either. But, they will try to gather evidence. So, they will cross question you. Either they will ask nicely or they will scare you. Your mom and I may be beaten up, before you. But, if they don't get the answers they want, they'll let us go. So no matter what happens... anything at all... ...you can't change your statement under any circumstances. Just stick to your story. Can you both do that? Dad, will they beat you and mom up very badly? Don't think about that. When you are naughty, I hit you too, right? That's about it. Don't be scared. It's late. Go to bed. Good night. - Good night. Vijay, how are we going to prove we weren't here on Saturday? Someone must have seen you at the office or at Martin's corner. Of course, they must have. - Then what? Nandini, what happened to us... ...has left us with only two options. Either we give in... ...or we stand up and fight. I don't think, we've done anything wrong. So, there's no way I'm going to give in. We will fight. Now, this is a game. We may win, or we may lose. But, I can guarantee one thing. No matter what happens... ...you or the kids won't go to prison. I can't say for sure, that it was Vijay Salgaonkar. Really? You said, it was Vijay. No, when you asked, is that Vijay... ...I thought, it was probably him. But, I can't say for sure it was him. Who did you see? Sir, I couldn't see too clearly. I can't tell if it was Vijay or someone else. When he mentioned Vijay, I had a doubt. Was that the car? It was yellow, like this car. But, I can't say for sure. Salvi, there must be something... ...that you can be sure of!? - Gaitonde! You? Sir, I didn't see the license number. But, it was yellow like this one. There are many yellow cars, like this one. Sir, a retired professor lives next door. He has the same kind of yellow car. Oh, then it could be that car. What? You could say that for sure? He thinks he's so intelligent! Sir, a fax from the IG office. Sir, Sameer Deshmukh went on a school trip, the last month. Two students from Vidya Vikas Vidyalaya were there, too. I have their names and addresses. One of them is Anju Salgaonkar. Vijay Salgaonkar's daughter. Adopted. Adopted? - Yeah. I didn't know that. Yes, sir. When Vijay was 21 years old... ...he found a baby near a garbage bin on the road. Someone had abandoned that little baby. Vijay is an orphan himself. That's why, he took the child home. Later, he adopted her legally. I always thought Anju and Vijay were related by blood. What is this, Gaitonde? Shame on you for accusing such a decent man. Sir, sir! Just because he adopted an orphan, it doesn't mean... ...that, he can't commit crimes. We just found out... ...Sameer and Anju are connected in some way. I think, we should arrest Vijay... ...slap him around a bit and he'll spill the beans. Don't let this information leak out of this station. It's... - 1 1 :30 am. A square plus B square equals A square, plus B square, plus 2AB. A plus B whole cube equals to... ...a cube, plus... - Ma'am. Anju. The principal wants to see you. Yes, ma'am. The police has one last piece of evidence to prove what happened. Our fear. So, forget what happened. Try to behave normally. The police do not know what happened in this house. They will question us on the basis of circumstantial evidence. We have to answer them without any fear. They will fake things, too. But, you knew Sam. Don't ever refuse to accept that. Just don't tell them anything that happened in this house. May I come in, ma'am? Are you Vijay Salgaonkar's daughter? Yes, sir. Do you know this boy? Oh, that's Sam. So, how do you know Sam? I represented my school at a nature camp, last month. That's when I got to know him. Was it just an acquaintance, or... No, sir. Just an acquaintance. Just like all the other students at the camp. There were thousands of students at the camp, how come you remember Sam's face? Sir, Sam was quite famous at the camp. Why? He took pictures of girls at the camp. He shot videos, too. Then, a lawyer's daughter complained about him. Oh, I see. Did Sam ever come to meet you after the camp? No, sir. - Why are you lying? We were told, he came to meet you. Who told you that? Did Sam tell you? Yes, he did. Sam told us. Sir, Sam is lying. Did Sam come to meet you... ...on the 2nd of October at your place? To my place? - Yes. Not at all. Besides, we weren't home on the 2nd of October. Where did you go? Swami Chinmayanand was holding a sermon at Panaji. We all attended it. Who all attended it? Mom, dad, my younger sister Anu and me. When did you get back? - The next day, the 3rd. Did the sermon last for 2 days? Yes, but, we attended it only on the 2nd. After that, we stayed in a hotel... ...and saw a movie the next day, before returning home. I see. Ma'am. Show us the attendance register, please. Let's see, whether she came to school on the second. There was a holiday at school on the 2nd. Gandhi Jayanti. Right, and the 3rd was a Sunday. That's why we planned it. So, you mean... ...you've never met Sam after the camp. No, sir. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am. Are you Vijay Salgaonkar's wife? Yes. Vijay! How come you are home at this time? Anju's principal called Nandini and informed her about your visit there. She got scared and called me. I went to the station and found out you're here. I rushed home. What has happened? We need to question you. Come in, let's sit down. Vijay, do you know this boy? No, sir. What about you? - No, sir. Have you seen this car? No sir. What about you? No, sir. Let me be frank, here. That's what I'd prefer, too. This is IG Meera Deshmukh's only son, Sam Deshmukh. He is missing, since the last 25 days. Last month, during the nature camp, he met... ...your daughter, Anju. We also have proof, he came here in a yellow Hyundai Getz. This car was recovered in the last month from Paavelim Stone Quarry. We came here for two reasons. First, Anju knew Sam. Secondly, Gaitonde saw you driving Sam's car. When you took the car past Subhash Salvi's house... ...I was there. We think, Sam came to your place. But, we weren't here on the 2nd. We went to Panaji for a sermon and got back on the third. Yes. Vijay Salgaonkar, your game is up. Sir, what more proof do you need? Don't you laugh at me! I didn't even mention... ...which date Sam came to your place. But, your wife... ...blurted, without being asked. Vijay, are you laughing at us? - No, sir. Why should I laugh at the police? Look at her, she is still shocked. She doesn't know what is going on. You've really petrified her. I told you, earlier, the principal called Nandini. She said, that you went to the school, about a case. You questioned Anju, too. You know, the school authorities panic in such situations. They think, the case will ruin the school's image. So, the principal called Nandini and told her all about it. Even the dates. Simple. Gaitonde says he saw you driving Sam's car on Sunday, the 3rd. You didn't answer him. There's no use. - Why? Because everyone knows we can't stand each other. No matter what I say he will brand me a liar. Forget about Gaitonde. Tell me the truth. If Gaitonde saw me... ...either he's lying or he is mistaken. Because, on 2nd October from 8:00 am... ...to 3 October, till 5:00 pm. My family and I were in Panaji. Sir, he's lying. I saw him, that day. What did you do from 2nd to the 3rd? Where did you go? Can you give me the details? - Of course. On 2nd October, we took the 5:30 am bus... ...and headed to Panaji. When you got back, was it raining? - Yes, it was. Nandini and the kids got drenched. So, they fell sick. They missed school for a couple of days. Okay. So, you kept the bills and tickets just to show us, right? Sir, who ever keeps bus tickets? Sir, we are middle class people. We try to save, as much as we can. We check the bills on the last day of the month. To find out the unnecessary expenses and the savings. I messed up, by talking about the dates, right? Yes. But, you explained everything and sent them away. They won't come back, right? Gaitonde, your allegations are nonsense. I think, Vijay and his family actually went to Panaji. Sir, I swear to you! It was Vijay. Sir, let's remand him to custody. He won't be so sharp once he's beaten up a bit. Anyway, inform the IG. Sir, let's get hold of Vijay, first. What if we inform the IG, later? Dad. - Yes. Did the police believe us? I don't know, dear. Will they come back? Yes, they will be back. What is his name? - Vijay Salgaonkar. Are you sure, he was driving Sam's car? Ma'am, I don't remember the license number. But, that was a yellow Hyundai Getz car. But, are you sure, Vijay Salgaonkar was driving it? Yes, sir. Absolutely sure. But, they said, they were at Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd. Sir, they're lying. - They're lying? But, what about all the proof of his trip? He showed us hotel bills and bus tickets. But, we will know if they are real or fake... ...only after we check them, sir. If Gaitonde is right, those bills must be forged. That won't be too difficult to find out. After all, he is an illiterate, fourth grade dropout. He can't be too smart. Tomorrow, bring Vijay, his family... ...and all the evidence shown by him to me. But, on what charge can we bring them in? Kidnapping. Not murder. Because, we need a corpse to prove that. You don't worry about protocol. I'll take care of it. Uncle! Uncle! Mr. Rane! You're here, early! The police took Vijay and his family in. When did you leave for Panaji? Sir, we took a private bus to Panaji at 5:30 am. So where's that bus ticket? His friend owns the bus, so the conductor didn't let us pay. When did you reach the venue of the sermon? At 8:30 am. The sermon had already begun. I guess, about 8:30 am. When we arrived, the sermon had begun. When did you reach the venue of the sermon? If our statements are exactly alike, they may have doubts. Especially when it comes to timings. Mom and I will give the exact time. You can skirt around it. I don't remember the exact time. But, when we arrived the sermon had begun. What time did the sermon begin after you got there? The police is going to try to ask complicated questions. Listen to them carefully, and then answer. The sermon began before we reached there. But, your mom and dad said that... ...the sermon began after you reached the venue. After half an hour. They will lie about us telling them something different. But, stick to your story, at all times. No! When we arrived the event had already begun. Martin. - This way. What's the matter? Where are they? They were taken in. - They were? These people aren't telling me anything! We want to go in. - You're not allowed in. He's Vijay's father-in-law. I don't care who he is. He's not allowed in and that's that. How can you stop me? You have taken my daughter into police custody, too! Come on, open the gate... - No! No, get back. - Open the gate. Get back! - Open the gate! Later, we went to a restaurant to eat food. What was the name of the hotel? I don't remember that. What did you eat? Pav Bhaji. What did the others eat? Everyone ate Pav Bhaji. But, Anju said that... ...she ate fried rice. No! She must have forgotten. I remember, we all ate Pav Bhaji. Hello? Yes, it's me. Tell me. No, that's a lie. Who told you that? See, I'm in a meeting, okay? I'll have to call you back. I'll call you back. A reporter from India TV called. They say, they have information that... ...we arrested a family in connection with Sam's case. Forget about it. I don't care, Mahesh. What do you think? Ma'am, this family is even tougher than we thought. No one changed their statements. Specially, the younger daughter, Anu. I am surprised she stuck to her story though she is so young! That's spot on. Absolutely correct. How can a child stick to her statement so firmly? I am sure something is wrong, ma'am. It's possible, they are all telling the truth. So, they are sticking to their statements. That's a possibility. Perhaps, Gaitonde is mistaken. No, Mahesh. One thing is certain. They know something about Sam. But, Meera, their statements so far... Mahesh, they're lying. It's a cooked up story. Ma'am, if they are lying... ...then, we can conduct a lie detector test. Are you stupid, Gaitonde? We can't conduct a lie detector test, just like that! We need a court order for that. So, why can't we get court orders? To do that we have to prove they are lying, in the court. So far, all the evidence we have found... ...proves the family wasn't there on that weekend. Sorry, I am sure you know what you're doing. Prabhu. - Yes, ma'am. They told us a story, right? So, bring all the characters from that story here. Got it? - Yes, ma'am. Besides that... ...if Vijay is lying about the trip to Panaji... ...then, there is someone who saw him here. Of course. A boy called Jose works in his office. Is there any other place which he visits, regularly? Yes, ma'am. There's a hotel named Martin's Corner. It's right in front of the police station. Vijay comes there, every day. - Okay. So, bring the office boy and hotel manager here, tomorrow. Okay, ma'am. One more thing.. When the family leaves, they should feel we believed their story. I was really nervous during the interrogation. Luckily, they believed us. Who said, they believed us? What do you mean? They won't let us go, so easily. They will be back. They will be even better prepared. They will be back. Why? Vijay, what's the problem? I am your brother-in-law. At least, tell me. Rajesh, every family has some secrets... ...that are best kept hidden. I am sorry. I can't tell you anything. But, I will need your help. What do you want me to do? I have known Vijay since he was a kid. He's really good and decent. With a heart of gold. I don't recall asking whether he has a heart of gold or silver. How many times did he visit your hotel on the 2nd of October? Normally, he comes twice a day. For evening tea, dinner. And sometimes, he comes over for lunch, too. I guess, he came over twice on the 2nd, too. No, wait! He wasn't here on the 2nd. He went to Panaji for a sermon. Then, why didn't you tell us that before? Sorry, sir. I remembered it out of the blue. A few days ago, Vijay and I spoke about that. What did he tell you about the sermon? He told me it was a very good event. He even told us what Swami Chinmayanand said. So, what did he say? He narrated one of the Jataka fables. It was the story of the king of Benaras... ...defeating his enemy with love and patience. When did Vijay get back from Panaji? The next day. - At what time? I don't know that. Because, he didn't come to the office that day. Did Vijay call you from Panaji? No. Is Vijay Salgaonkar your friend? Yes, he is. Did he travel on your bus recently? Yes. A few days ago. And before that? - Before that? Right. On the 2nd. Where was he going? - To Panaji. He was going to attend some sermon. Are you sure, those people were at your lodge? - Yes, sir. Are they your regular customers? No, Sir. - Then, how can you be sure... ...that they were at your lodge? I need a double room. Rs. 800 plus taxes. What are you saying? I have stayed here, before. You didn't charge taxes back then. Then you won't get any bills. That will do. Listen, this lodge doesn't seem to be good enough. Let's go to a family hotel. Come on, ma'am. This is a family hotel. Don't worry. He's been here, before. They checked the room first and only then did they book it. When did that happen? I don't remember, sir. Did they tell you why they were in Panaji? No, I don't remember, sir. Did you check their register? - Yes, ma'am. He has 2 registers. One of them has Vijay Salgaonkar's name. There's a check in on 2nd October. And... ...check out at 9:30 am on the 3rd. Why do you have two registers? Why don't you answer ma'am? One register is for the billing customers. The other is for customers who don't take bills. Do you know, that's a crime? How can you still remember them? Good customers are hard to forget. You own the hotel. Why? What's the matter? No. I have never eaten such tasty Pav Bhaji. Honestly, my wife makes that at home, but... We are famous for Pav Bhaji in the city of Panaji. The hotel is really clean and hygienic. The service is excellent. Once a hotel is famous, these days... ...the service tends to get tacky. But, you're not like that. I really like that. Thank you, sir. Uncle, the Pav Bhaji was really good. Really? Thank you. What's your name, dear? - Anu! Very good. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. I admit, you would remember customers who appreciate you. But, how do you remember which day... ...and why, they came to Panaji. They told me. As a businessman... Okay, okay, fine! You can wait outside. If Vijay Salgaonkar met all these people on 2nd and 3rd October... ...how can he be in Pondolem at the same time? Ma'am, I don't know. Now I am a bit confused, too. Can I say something? If you ask me, I believe... ...Vijay and his family are telling the truth. Perhaps, your man is lying. No, sir. I'm telling the truth. It was Vijay Salgaonkar. I will resign, if I am proved wrong. Did you speak to Swami Chinmayanand? Yes, ma'am. He was out of town. He may be back by now. - Call him. Given what you've told me... ...it seems, Vijay and his family... ...were present at our sermon, that day. Because, every sermon of mine is unique. I never repeat it. Perhaps, someone who attended it told Vijay later. But, it's not possible that someone remembered all those details. Thank you, Swamiji. Where are dad and Anu? This is a digital projector. I dream of having my own theater in Pondolem. Very good! All the theaters have digital projection, these days. The costs are low and the quality is pristine. Dad. My elder daughter and my wife. - Hello. Do you remember when they came to you? On the 3rd of this month. How do you remember the date? He saw the first half of the film... ...from the projection room. And he also told me that, he... ...had come to Panaji for a sermon. And, he was staying in a lodge. Get out. Just get out! Let's go. Go out. Go on. Meera. Come on. Stop it. Look at me. Nothing will happen to Sam. Okay? Just stop worrying. We will find him. Don't worry and don't lose hope. I haven't given up, Mahesh. But, I am a mom too. I can't help that. Stop crying. Listen, this... Is this investigation taking the right course? Yes. I think so. Then, why can't we unearth any clues? All the clues and witnesses seem to be in his favor. I know, Mahesh. All the proof and witnesses are in Vijay's favor. But, I know he's lying. They are all lying. I can feel it. The police can tell from the way a person talks... ...whether he's lying or telling the truth. I underestimated him by considering him uneducated. That was a mistake. He may be a 4th grade dropout, but he is extremely cunning. He is really wily. Vijay Salgaonkar is a very good man. I have checked his records. He came to this village 25 years ago. First, a tea stall, then a grocery shop. A video library, a garage. He worked in diverse places and grew up. Later, he started up his own business. He's a fourth grade dropout. But, he knows Marathi, Hindi, English and Konkani. He says, he learnt all that from watching films. He does love movies. He never misses out a single film. Films. That's an important link. Come on, let's go! Wait a bit. What is it? I forget to get money for the tickets. Is there any ATM nearby? I... What is this? I will have to hold up the bus for you. There's an ATM up ahead, go ahead and hurry back. Two minutes. - Go on. Prabhu, get me all the CCTV footage from that ATM. Where is it? In Panaji? Taligaon bus stand, 5 kms away from Panaji. When was the bus scheduled to leave? At 3:00 pm in the afternoon. I want the CCTV footage for the ATM... ...for 3rd October, from 2:30 pm to 3:30 pm right now. Sawant! You meet thousands of passengers, every day. - Yes. Let's say, you remember the family due to the ATM. But, when did the family go to Panaji? Why were they there? It is impossible to remember all of that. He told you something 25 days ago. How do you still remember it? I don't remember. He told me. Yes, but, you were told 25 days ago. How can you still... - No, I... What do you mean? - I mean... ...he told me that, when... ...we met again, recently. Again? - Yes. When? A few days ago. Where? Where did you meet him? Uncle! - Oh, how are you? How come you're here? Vijay, don't you remember him? We came here for Chinmayanand's sermon on 2nd October. When we were going back the next day... ...he was the conductor on our bus. You went to withdraw cash at the ATM... Oh, right! On the 2nd, after the sermon... ...we went back on the bus on the 3rd. You were the conductor on that bus. - Right. You forget everything! Sorry, I... - That's okay. See you later. - Okay. Mr. Vasu, has the show begun? It's you! No, there's still time. Where is your family? No, I am alone today. - Okay. There was a sermon on the 2nd, right? That's why the family was with me. We went shopping on the 3rd and then came for a movie. After that, we ate at the hotel and then went back home. Imagine how expensive that can be. Dinkar. We went to the sermon at Panaji on the 2nd on your bus. You didn't accept any money from me. But, that won't happen today. Let me buy the tickets today. Don't do that! Why don't you tell him? She won't say anything to me! Here, give me tickets. You've come after a while, sir. No, we were here on the 2nd for the sermon at Panaji. We visited exactly a day after the sermon. On 3rd October. Right. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. 3 weeks? - I told you, I'm going to Panaji for the sermon. I told you to pay this the day after I got back. Yes. - When did I go to Panaji? Well... On Saturday, the 2nd of October. Yes. - When did I go? On Saturday, the 2nd of October. When did I get back? On Sunday the 3rd of October. Yes, you got back on Sunday, 3rd October. The next day on 4th October, a Monday... ...I told you to pay this. Yes. - Go and pay it. The other king was reformed by his example. The moral of this story is, we must cultivate... ...the power to forgive others. Great! Very good! But, how did you hear that story? I told you, we went to Panaji... ...to attend Swami Chinmayanand's sermon. When? Did you forget, already? We went on the 2nd, it was a Saturday. And we got back on the 3rd. That's where I heard this story. Okay. Ma'am. Swami Chinmayanand. Yes, Swamiji. My followers record my sermons. They are provided to the devotees via DVDs. The devotees can make bookings. They can pick them up from the ashram, within 2 weeks. I have seen the booking list for the sermon on the 2nd. But, Vijay Salgaonkar's name doesn't feature in it. Alright, thank you so much. Possibly, he booked it under another name. It's possible. But it doesn't prove he wasn't in Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd. Ma'am, the CCTV footage for the ICICI Bank. No. It's over, finished. Vijay was telling the truth. - But, sir... We have wasted so much time! It may have been better to try to find Sam instead. But, I really... - Gaitonde. But, what more proof do you want now? It's over, it's finished. But... Meera. Our investigation hinges on the fact, that... ...whether Vijay was in Panaji on the 2nd and 3rd, or not? The camera doesn't lie, Meera! The CCTV proves, that Vijay was in Panaji on the 3rd. Vijay was in Panaji on the 3rd. Vijay was in Panaji on the 3rd, too! Makes sense. That means... - Meera. Mahesh, he knew we were going to watch this CCTV footage. In fact, he wanted us to see it. That was part of his plan, Mahesh. - What plan, Meera? It was an amazing plan. At about 8:30 am. - The sermon had started by then. Vijay wasn't here on the 2nd. He saw the entire first half of the film in the projection room. No one forgets about good customers, ma'am. He told me about that, recently again, when we met. We had come to Panaji for a sermon, on the 2nd. He just recreated that day. In fact, both the days. The 2nd and 3rd of October. What do you mean? What do we usually remember? Something we have seen for ourselves. Visuals. Visuals. Something we see, can't be easily forgotten. Visual memories are the strongest memories. For example, cinema. You know, the stories you are watching are not real. But, you still believe in them. Because, you have seen the story and lived it in a way. In the same way... ...Vijay and his family not only concocted the story about Panaji... ...in fact, they lived it out. They actually went to Panaji. They stayed at a lodge. They did eat the Pav Bhaji. He sat in the projection room and watched the film. So, they stuck to their statements, during the interrogation. Because, they were telling the truth. Apart from one little detail. What was that? They didn't do all that on the 2nd and 3rd of October. They did that, some other day. Perhaps, the next day. Ma'am. Vijay said, it was raining on the way back, they were drenched. And his family fell sick. He also said, his kids missed school for a few days. He showed us the medical bills too. You can get fake medical bills very easily, Sawant. Anyway, he's been throwing bills at us from the word go. But, there is an entry in the lodge register for the 2nd. The bus and film tickets for the 3rd are authentic, right? That's a valid point, ma'am. Very well played, fourth grade dropout, Vijay Salgaonkar. But, I know how you did that. Vijay went to Panaji on 3rd October in Sam's car. He took a take away from a restaurant. Then, he probably bought a used phone. He put Sam's SIM card into it. Then, he dumped the phone into a truck with a national permit. Then, he probably dumped Sam's car into the lake at the quarry. Then, he went back to a restaurant and bought four Pav Bhaji takeouts. He purchased four tickets to the cinema, on that day. Then, he went to Taligaon bus stand... ...and withdrew the money from the ATM at 3:00 pm. Then, he took a Kadamba bus... ...bought 4 tickets and got back to Pondolem. He went to his office at night. He told Jose, he was going for the sermon, the next day. The next morning he took his family... ...and travelled by Dinkar's private bus to Panaji. Vijay told him he was going to Panaji for the sermon. On reaching Panaji, he may have reached the hermitage at 9:00 am. Then, they spent the whole day at the ashram. Meanwhile, he found out about the DVDs for the sermon. He booked it under an assumed name. They arrived at Rishabh Lodge in the evening. Then, I guess, while the manager gave Nandini the tour... ...Vijay filled his name in the entries for the 2nd. Then, when the manager returned he disguised his handwriting... ...and took the room under an assumed name. They ate out at night. The next day, they ordered food from the same restaurant... ...where he bought the take aways on the 3rd. After checking out of the lodge, he took his family to the hotel... ...where he had order four Pav Bhaji takeaways. Again, they ate pav bhaji there. They made friends with the owner while paying the bill. Then, they watched a film. They got acquainted with the projectionist. Later, while withdrawing money from the ATM at the bus stand... ...Vijay got off the bus. But, he didn't enter the ATM. They made friends with the conductor on the Kadamba bus. They got back home and a few days later... ...Vijay watched the sermon with his family. Then, he destroyed all the bills for the fifth. He showed us bills for the 3rd. A few days later he went back to Panaji with his family. He met everyone, once again. Then, he very cleverly, talked to them... ...and implied... ...that, he and his family went to Panaji on the 2nd for a sermon. He got back on the evening of 3rd October. So, they all didn't realize they were giving false testimonies. They kept thinking they were telling the truth. Master stroke. So, Vijay Salgaonkar... ...mocked the entire police department. And despite knowing about all of that... ...we have no proof or evidence against him. All we have is a theory. Without proof or witnesses... ...a confession is the greatest evidence. What do you mean? Where are you taking me? - Come on! Let him go! - Come on! Don't shout! - Come on. Let me go, sir. - Get in. Take them all away! - Get in, come on! How can they take them away? Let us go! I will need your help. What do you want me to do? - If the police takes us again... ...just call these people. Where is my son? I don't know. We weren't at home. Do you think, the police are fools? We have figured out your plan, Vijay. It's no use lying, now. We know, you were not in Panaji on the 2nd or 3rd. You were there on the 4th and the 5th. You didn't attend any sermon. Why did my son come to meet you? What happened with the two of you? I never met Sam after the camp. Really. Listen to me. I've had enough of your stories. It's over. You better tell me the truth. Or we have other ways to do this. I'm telling the truth, I don't know anything. You know how I feel, don't you? After all, you are a mom. Tell me the truth. My son came to meet your daughter and vanished. What happened with them? We have already told the truth. Gaitonde! Tell me, what's the truth? Tell me! Tell me, what is it? Please, don't! - Get back! Speak up! - Dad! Tell me! Let's see, how much you can take. Tell me! Dad! Tell me! Where is Sam? Tell me! Tell me! - Don't hit him. What the heck! Tell me! You better tell me. Please, ma'am. Please, tell him to stop. Please! Speak up! Please! Gaitonde! Where is my son? Speak up! - Come on! Come on, speak up! Tell me! Tell ma'am where her son is! Tell her, where is Sam? Tell her! Speak up! Tell her! He came to meet you, right? Tell us where is Sam? - Go on! Speak up! - Mom! Tell us, where is Sam? Alex is here. Send him in. - Tell us! Tell us, where is Sam? - Meera, tell them to stop, please. Alex is here. - Speak up! Tell us, where is Sam? Okay, stop it. Come with me. You... - Gaitonde, stop it! Get back. Vijay, tell me what you know. Do you people enjoy getting bashed up? I'm telling the truth. I don't know anything. Do you know this girl? No, aunt. Alex. Sam was with you at the nature camp. Sam is missing for 26 days. You know that. I am sure, she is connected to his disappearance. So, please, if you have any information... ...do tell us, right now. Uncle, I don't know anything. You called Sam on the day he vanished. Correct? But, you refused to admit to it the other day. Are you going to tell me, or should I tell them? Aunt, I spoke to him, but... ...he didn't tell me where he was. How is she connected to Sam? Tell me, or I am going to slap you. I'll tell you. Stay here. Hey, bro! Send this to me. Sorry, not yet. Why? Send it! - Not now. First, I should make use of this. Ma'am. There is a huge crowd outside. The media is asking for you. Tell them to get lost. Don't let them get in. Call for reinforcements, if needed. Now what? What do we do? We'll end this. Go out, everyone. Gaitonde, you stay here. I found out about the video clip. Where is Sam? We don't know, ma'am. I'm telling the truth. Gaitonde, I want the truth. Do whatever it takes. - Yes, ma'am. You darn... Where is Sam? Tell me, where is Sam? Tell me! Tell me! You tell me! Tell me, where is Sam? - No! Where is Sam? - Mom! Tell me! Don't you know? Leave her. You must know! Tell me, what did you do to Sam? I don't know. - You don't know? Tell me! Are you obstructing a police officer? Are you holding the police back? You! Get lost! Are you holding the police back? Are you holding the police back? Are you holding the police back? Are you going to talk? Tell me, where is Sam? I don't know, sir. - You don't know? You don't know? Listen, I am going to kill all of you. Tell me. Won't you tell me? I don't know. You don't know? Tell me. - Mom! No. Meera, stop him. Please. Tell me. Where is Sam? I don't know. You don't know? Look! If I hit them a bit more... ...your mom, dad and sister will die. If you don't want that tell the truth. No... - Tell us. Tell me. Listen, I'm going to kill them all. Will that do? Tell me, are you okay with that? Gaitonde. She won't speak before the parents. Send them away. Please. If you know anything about Sam, tell us! Where is Anu? My daughter is in there. - Wait. But, my daughter is in there... - You can't go in. My daughter is in there. - Wait. Did he come to your house? I don't know, uncle. I want to go to my parents. Be honest then, I will take you to your parents. You better be honest, or I am going to get upset. When I get angry... ...you know, what I can do. Tell me the truth or I am going to kill you! We should tell them the truth. Gaitonde is a monster. What if something happens to Anu? I am really scared, now. I am going to confess. Then, everything will be fine, right? - No, Nandini. Why did we suffer so much? Why did we take the beatings? So we could give in? I promised you, none of you will go to prison. I will keep my promise. Anu... Anu... - Don't worry about Anu. She's a brave girl. Tell me, what is the truth? - Uncle, I don't know! I want to go to my mom and dad! Meera, this is it. Just stop him! Enough is enough! What we're doing here is illegal! What about my son? Who is going to look for him? We have to look for him but this is not the way! Who does this? At least, have mercy on that child. What are you doing to her? And what's going to happen after all this? Did anyone tell you anything? I tell you after all this, if we find out that... ...this family is innocent, we will really regret it. I mean, just consider for a moment, what if Gaitonde is mistaken? Tell me the truth! Tell me! - Gaitonde! No! Don't hit me! I will tell you. Mom! Anu! Where are you taking my daughter? Your daughter is taking us. Where you buried the boy. Your game is up, Vijay Salgaonkar. All done. Now, your next family trip is going to be in prison. Hey, get them all into the jeep. Get back! Come on. Come on. Come on. Alright, let's go. Come on, get back. Get back. Come on, Let's go. Wait! - Come on. Let us go in. He's our son. No one is allowed to meet the accused. Accused? What has he done? Wait. You'll find out. Ma'am. Gaitonde did this. Vijay stood up to him. Gaitonde wants revenge. Uncle, what's going on here? We don't know yet. They won't even tell us anything. That's my daughter and son-in-law. The police remanded them without any call, a few days back. They were interrogated. Interrogated? About what? The IG's son is missing. It's about him. Who are you? This is my son. We all know Vijay and his family. They are good people. They are being framed here. Gaitonde, the man next to Mr. Prabhu... ...has been responsible for this! Meera! You okay? Anu! Sorry, dad. I was scared. That's why, I told them. That's okay, dear. He hit you? Yes. Don't be scared. I'm with you. Meera. Meera, please. Please... Rajesh, Gaitonde hit us. He hit our baby Anu. We are innocent and still we were thrashed in the room. Gaitonde did it! Wait, Gaitonde! What the heck! You... He hit my daughter. Don't touch him, okay? - Who are you? Get lost. You hit a little girl! Hit him! He hit a little girl! - Sawant! Hit him! He hit Anu! - Ma'am. Sir. Hit him! - Meera, come, let's go. Hit him! He hit a little girl! Don't you dare touch the child. Hit him! He hit a little girl! In the case of the missing Sam Deshmukh, son of the Goa IG... ...the police has brutally tortured... ...Vijay Salgaonkar and his family despite their innocence. There is hostility all over, against them. After this incident, the Pondolem police station... ...SI Gaitonde has been suspended. Orders have been sent out for further investigation. Senior PI Prabhu and the officers on this case... ...have all been transferred out at once. The DGP has sent IG Meera Deshmukh, on an indefinite leave. In its verdict on a PIL, the court has decreed... ...that if the police... ...wants to interrogate Vijay Salgaonkar or his family... ...they need court orders to do so. Vijay. Vijay, don't you think that... ...their lives are completely ruined? Anyway, it wasn't her fault. She was an IG and a mother. I feel as if we did the crime and she paid for it. It's good of you to feel that way. But, if it were Anju instead of Sam... ...and vice versa... ...wouldn't IG Meera try to save her son? Of course, she would. There's nothing wrong or right about this. A person can't live without his family. He can go to any extent for his family. The world may call him self serving or selfish. I guess, it's best to forget about this. Vijay, when did you get the corpse out of the pit? After I got back from disposing Sam's car. On Sunday night. Where did you bury it? I have kept that secret safe in my heart. That is best for all of us. I will take it with me, when I die. Did you hope that Anu... ...would bear it all without giving in till the end? No. I didn't think the three of you could keep it together for so long. Anu could have spoken up earlier. Poor Anu. You've suffered a lot because of me. Dad, the police is here. Why are you here? Are you back to harass them? We just want to talk to Vijay. Do you have a court order? What's up, Vijay? - It's okay, you leave. I'm going to change and be with you. We are not here... ...as the IG, the police or a businessman. We are here as parents. We had given up hope of being parents. But then... ...we suddenly had a son. Our only son. I guess, that's why we pampered him so much that... ...we are regretting it today. Vijay, when we thought about it we realized... ...whatever our son has experienced... ...or not... ...is perhaps, our own fault. We pampered him no end and ruined him. That's why we wanted to meet you, too. Inadvertently... ...we have harassed you and your family a lot. Sorry. We are sorry. We are really sorry. We are leaving the country. To London. To live with her brother. But, before we leave, Vijay... ...just tell us... ...what happened to Sam? Whenever there is a call we think, it's Sam. When the doorbell rings, it feels like he's there. We can't bear the suspense. We can't live like this. Just tell us, should we... ...wait for him? Or... That's all. No, Meera. It's not your fault. I can understand. Why would you trust us? We are sorry, again. Sorry. Come, let's go. Meera, let's go! We are sorry, too. I wish, I was as generous as you. But, I am merely a fourth grade dropout. I have a wife. I have two daughters. And that's the extent of my world. I have never thought beyond that. One day, my world... ...saw an unwanted guest enter. He wanted to... ...disrupt our world. We tried to stop him. We begged him. But, he didn't listen. Then, somehow... ...a tragedy occurs. We send the unwanted guest... ...to a place, from where there is no coming back. We have given you the greatest anguish in the world. I tried to say sorry many times. I did so, in my heart. What else could we do? My family is most important to me. I could do anything for them. I could go to any extent. At that moment, I lose sight of right or wrong. We are sorry. Listen to me. Sir has called you. Sir, I'm going to keep my bags in the quarters. Sir, this is Vijay Salgaonkar. I know. I have seen you on the TV. Here you are. Sign that. You must be feeling really proud. You have fooled the police and all that. You just wait. Once the corpse is found, then we shall see. I am going to be here for a couple of years. I am going to find it. No, sir. Who am I to fool the police? I respect the police. I think, the police protects us. - Right. I believe... ...you and your police station... ...will always protect us. I'll leave, now. The slab has been laid at the police station. The flooring will be laid on Monday.
