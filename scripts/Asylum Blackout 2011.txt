I can not claim anything. That we not publish the jihad? Tonight we set a mine the watchtower. It is already bad. Many bad. None of us would have done it. Comrade Captain, how to correctly writes: "Njilski" or "hippo"? no-Iski. Comrade Captain, There is some, but I do not know who. Eh, that's Cara here. It can not.

They go around the country... - Quiet! There lives poksok. How do you know if the cobra or viper? In the army I learned to distinguish between them. Hop is much worse than cobras.

Everything is business as usual, sir Dzur. Yesterday came the amplification of seven people. Border guards have been totally neglected. In Moscow, have their own problems. They are not up to us. Good. Seven people say... Continue to follow the watchtower! Phase One, what happened with your girlfriend? Will there be a wedding? There will be bridal, sir Dzur, but later! As just smells. What aroma. If presoliwill kill you! It's over. Let's go! Is everything OK sir? Corridor is open. To bring to you something? Without actually makes it easier. Some other help? You keep the border, in my work has not interfered. Do not be angry, Comrade Captain! His soul is suffering. Two years ago his wife disappeared. It is said to have been stolen. How do I steal? Who? It is said that the Dzur- leader of the mujahedin. And what terrorists are doing with Russian women, you know... They do not stay long in life with them. Now I understand. So so. Write: "Nataice" I? - Lepotice mine, I love you, love, love... Do not be so repetitive. Understand - can not! You write! I know what I feel! And you know, what kind of girl like our captain.

Because I already have a girlfriend. - Come on, Trasak! Come on, write! Dear Natasha! - Okay. Today I have... ...Military and my dog ... ...Caught... two? - Three! Trt commandos at the border! - That's right! Turn around, you need to get dressed. Well dressed up. Are you married? Yes, I'm married. They tell me that your wife ran away? Not run away, is simply gone. Women just like they do not go. Here is a war. And for you it is better to go. Stop! Zalegnite! Lying on the ground, to hell! Are you completely insane? Run like a flock! What a machine! Comrade Captain, are scared for you! - Otstupaj! Deviates towards the watchtower! Do you know me? I'm Babrovski. How many people keep dzura? Dzur has a lot of people. This is his country. You will not get to it. Where Dzur keeps Russian women? Dzur is a warrior, he does not keep a woman. Or selling them or killing them. Cara, bring it! Comrade Captain, we have a guest. Oh, hello Abdul! - Hello Commander! At the place! Do not be afraid! Cara is a smart, do not bite. We promised him that he will make slippers. Permitting? What we promised we need to do. It is important guest. - Hey, boy! Gricuk to come with me. - I understand! Well, boy, go I? All of these go hand Vladimir Ivanovich. Even as I run everything I made. Mother taught me. Is I tugujefor the homeland? Do not pull the homeland? Pulling me sir. Funny how she pulls. Brother for a long time not seen... Sister... She is the youngest of them all.

Fired at you, I... Why do you feel, commander! I can not live with that. Calm down, Ljoha. I'd also done. Welcome home. The child should be fed. Zastavnice, take it! - I understand! Now we are going to organize everything? We all have... Nacic the bottle and pacifier, and milk powder... Captain, we need to talk. Have collected a lot of people, have a technique. Public speaking about the attack. I do not know with how many people have, but in my opinion, with two of the three thousand. What do you think you will attack? Almost certainly will not. How do you know? We dzura liquidated. Long will be discussed, until we elect a new leader. I understand. Should inform the squad. We should not lose time. Everything is done. We need to act. Phase Two is right to attack. Phase One does not have enough experience to carry out such action. To wait for our brothers from Eviada. If you do not take a Dushanbe, jobs will be tardy. Phase Two is right, I support it. I agree. Phase is finished good military training in Pakistan. If so distinguished a man as Said-chess have confidence in the phase I join. I. Ranker Dienko. - I.
