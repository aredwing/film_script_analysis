(children cheering) I want to play in that game so bad. Yeah, right, Banks. You've got to be at least 5' tall. Rejected. Yo, there's that kid I was telling you about-- Mick Leary. He's the baddest kid in the village. Charlie's voice: The first time I saw him, Mick was already infamous. Danny told the story of the legendary ass-kicking Mick gave Alfie Lucio for tagging over his tag on the schoolyard wall-- how Alfie was begging for mercy, but Mick just wouldn't stop. Alfie: Stop stop stop! Charlie's voice: I couldn't get my 10-year-old head around it. How could he do that? How could he not stop? Did you see that? He knows me. Yeah, man, he said "What's up?" to me. Charlie's voice: Every kid grows up with a bogeyman under his bed. Mine terrorized Greenwich Village and smoked Newports. (guests chattering) If I had a mind to  I wouldn't want to think like you  And if I had time to  I wouldn't want to talk to you  Ohh-hh  I don't care what you do  I wouldn't want to be like you  Yeah  If I was high class  I wouldn't need a buck to pass  If I was a fall guy  I wouldn't need no alibi  I don't care what you do  I wouldn't want to be like you  Oh oh, yeah  Back on the bottom line  Digging for a lousy dime...  (can rattling) (woman giggling) Stop it. Stop. Oh, hey, Mick. Hey, boy. - Yo. - Hey, Gabby. - Hey, Mick. - What're you doing? Hey, this is Charlie. - Hey, what's up? - Hey. Um, this is Beth. Hey. Hey, do I know you? Um, not officially. No no no, he lives uptown. He goes to Trinity. I know him from Hubies. Oh. It's nice to officially meet another of Danny boy's boojie friends from his boojie sports camp. (can hissing) BC. Blue collar-- big color. Any friend of Danny boy's is a friend of mine. Oh. No, I don't have a tag. Boojie boy. Okay. How do you spell that? Give me that. Hey, he likes you. Yeah. - Yo, Danny, come on. - Hey, shut up. All right. Yeah, right? Hey. - Hey, whoa. - Tim, get off me. Danny, Mick, this is Julie's cousin from Larchmont-- Tim. And that's Owen. Hey, what's up, guys? Yo, you mind vacating so I can piss? Yeah, I mind. You want to watch me? Gabby: Tim, shut up. Just wait a minute. Yeah, right. The guy's being a dick. Seriously, get the fuck out. You guys, just use the bathroom downstairs. I'm serious. Fuck no. Do I look like a pussy? Yeah, kind of. Outside. Lead the way. You're fucking dead. Duty calls. - No. - Why? Are you sure? Yeah. Booje, let's go, - you and me, come on. - What? - Come on. - What? Don't worry about it. Go with him. You'll be fine. - No, l-- - Don't worry about it. Go. All right. All right. (loud bang) Hold my gold. Girl: Do something. Ooh, now you really look like a pussy. Blue collar-- big color. Boojie-- B-O-O-J-l-E. (fence rattles) Man: Your statement's very incriminating. We can put this guy away with your help. What is he being charged with? Attempted murder. Both boys are in critical condition. Attempted murder? How bad is this kid? He's got a substantial jacket. You heard the phrase "born to lose"? Coined for Leary. So what's his story? No father, a sketchy mother, mostly state-raised. Got charisma, though. Got a following down in the village-- good kids too, like Charlie. That's mostly about beating up rich kids and graffiti. I'm not a part of it. Not many kids would have the guts to do what you're doing. You should be proud of yourself. Spread 'em. Spread 'em. Come on, read him his fucking rights or something. - Give me your hand. - Are you fucking kidding me? Shut up. Give me your other hand. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. This is bullshit, man. Go. I smell your fucking cologne, you piece of shit. (rings doorbell) Man: I got it. (quiet piano music playing) (door opens and closes) Oh, hey. Hey. You guys know Charlie Banks, right? - Hi. - Do we? Guess what. Well, Mick's in jail. Somebody ratted him out for beating up those two guys at Gary's party. Remember? Who? I don't know. - Holy shit. - Yeah, seriously. So what's gonna happen? I don't know, but whoever ratted him out better not show their face below 14th Street again. They'd get their asses kicked. You think he should go to jail? No. I don't know, he hurt those guys at the party pretty bad. The deal with Mick is, you know, he can be a really great guy. But he's just-- he's got this thing. I mean, you saw how cool he was with you. Yeah, he called me boojie. So? You are. I am and you're not? Fuck no. You can't tag and be a booje. Danny, you're rich. You're pretty much boojie. I'm not rich. I told you that already. I'm not rich. My parents are rich. Yeah, right. Look, Mick's my friend, you know? We grew up in the neighborhood together. He's got my back no matter what. That's what friends do for each other. It's what I'd do for you. No matter what? Yeah, no matter what. All right, come on. (chattering) You know what? Actually, Danny, I'm gonna go help my dad at the store. - Are you serious? - Yeah. I'll see you later. All right, later, you fucking weirdo. - Man: Danny. - Yo. (distant siren wailing) Danny: Yo, Terry. You could do whatever you want. I could just say my statement was made under duress; it was all lies; I stand by none of it. Where'd you pick up that bullshit? My father owns a bookstore. I looked it up. - Has somebody threatened you? - No. What happened? I changed my mind. Oh. What's your old man have to say about it? Um... You didn't tell him, did you? There could conceivably be legal ramifications to this, not to mention those two kids almost died. (phones ringing) (door chime jingles) What did you do, drop out of school? Worse. Did you join the army? Hi. I got a call from the DA. I'm terribly disappointed with the choice you made. Actually, it's a little more complicated than that. Bullshit. There's no justification for senseless brutality. And you were not raised to stand by and condone it. I'm not condoning it. The DA is dropping the case because you were all they had. And this Leary character-- he spent the last three weeks in jail for what he did to these two boys, and now he's just gonna walk away. Well, I'm sorry. Yeah. You can have a head full of the best ideas, but if you can't make the right moves in the world, they're worthless. Charlie's voice: I stayed out of the Village and avoided Mick for the next couple of years until I went away to school. And after a while the fight on the roof and my flirtation with the judicial system faded from my daily thoughts like a bruise. I was in college now. It was time to start over and aim high. Only two things mattered-- books and girls. Well, one thing really. ...Perfect way to end the war of ways  The only way to be a  Work of art  Oh, to be a work of art  Work of art  Oh, to be a work of art...  (exhales) (chuckles) Oh, thanks. These were a gift. Are you down with Schumpeter's theory of constructive destruction? No, but it sounds very cheeky and kind of ironic. Hmm. Yeah, Schumpeter posits that when industries advance new technologies that cannibalize the old-- it's constructive destruction. Yeah, you gotta be cruel to be kind. That's not Schumpeter. No, Nick Lowe. Hmm. Well, spare the rod-- spoil the child. Uh, no pain, no gain. (chuckles) Ever cloud has a silver lining. Okay, we need to leave this room immediately. Yeah. - It's depressing. - It is depressing. (chattering, laughing) Oh, man, yo, there she is. Yo, she's going into the Wick. Wait, hold on. Hold on. - What, her? - Yeah. I don't want to follow her right in. I might as well bring some binoculars. What, she's what? She's a super-hot scion of a 200-year-old American political dynasty? - Yeah. - Well, okay, your grandfather ran the communist party from above this fish market in Philadelphia. I see huge possibilities here, Charlie. - Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you? - What? Why do you wear those shitty-ass Capezios like you're some kind of moof who can't afford a new pair? What, you hate my shoes? Yeah, obviously. I've been given the gift of sight, unfortunately. - Charlie, you hate my shoes? - Yeah, and you got something there. - I'll kick your ass with these shoes. - It won't hurt. - Charlie Banks! - Hi. Hey, how goes the story with our man Raskolnikov? Okay. - Dude, Mary is over there. - You're on your own. So is her roommate, El Greco. I know you think she's fine. I see you looking at her all the time. Thanks. Danny, you need to examine your isolationist stance. He only wants to hang out with you because he hasn't done his reading in his Russian Lit class. You know that, right? And there goes your beer. They're all like that, man. He hasn't done his reading in any of his classes. And you don't know what they're all like. Come on. Leo, Leo, hi. Charlie. Charlie Banks. You look great. - Hey, come here. This is Mary. - I'm Mary. - Hi. Charlie. - And the lovely Nia. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Charlie Banks. Take a seat. Oh, this is Danny. He's my better half. Danny, how are you? A pleasure. You know, you can sit down like a real human being. Hey, you know, if you guys play poker there's a game tonight at my place after last call. - What kind of stakes? - Oral sex. Ew, Leo. Sorry. Oh, Nia, of course, is only committed to handle any male genitalia with external appendages. - What, is that just hands? - No no, feet as well. Why is that? Leo: Well, she's already spoken for. Thus her more intimate cavities are out of bounds. Her parents, as it's a Greek custom, have promised her to a man for three goats, 40 drachmas and half a ton of veggies, right? I'm sorry. We're in French class together, right? - Yeah. - We've got an exam tomorrow. That's right, yeah. You have an exam tomorrow. We all have exams tomorrow. Can I please have another tequila shot and a round for my friends-- three for Nia and two for these two lovely ladies? Thank you. Man: You got it, Leo. Charlie, you know what? I remember being a freshman. Those were the two best years of my life. Danny: Luck? Did you say luck? What? Luck is half the game in this thing. It's statistics. It's reading people-- seeing who's betting big and who's bluffing. - Charlie: Right. - Danny: I got a read on you. You know what it's like? There's this guy from the neighborhood, Fat-Ass Tommy. - (laughing) - That's funny? - Isn't it supposed to be funny? - No, it's not supposed to be funny. - Do you want me to tell my story? - No, it's incredibly deep and profound. - Please tell it. - Okay, fine. Fat-Ass Tommy says that luck is like milk and cigarettes, okay? Eventually it runs out. - Simple terms, but it's true. - Charlie: I think it's just simple. I don't know if there's much truth to that. - Who is this Fat-Ass Tommy? - That's Danny's imaginary friend - from the neighborhood, right? - Yeah. I think you're sitting on him, Nia. You know what? Seriously, guys, I'm not even-- I'm not even that good at this game. You guys just suck. Oh, really? Okay, I'm sorry. Charlie sucks. You guys are painfully mediocre. You know what? You're going down, bitch, 'cause I'm gonna put one of these red currencies in for $5. You've got nothing, Charlemagne, nothing but wet dreams. I'll see that and I'll raise you $5. Oh, there's a raise. All right, I'm in. - I fold. - You fold? - Really? - Okay, well, last card, down and dirty. Charlie: Oh, wow. Wow. No, it's exciting for me. - Bets to Charlie. - All right, another $5. I'll see that again. How do you feel about that? - What are you guys doing? - I'm done. Oh, that's just great. What time is it? - Mary: Charlie. - 'Cause I'm getting tired. Too bad. I knew your plan to bluff before I even dealt the cards. - Did you? - Yeah, I did. - It's obvious? - Yeah, very obvious. Did you tell him? Hey, is that true what Leo said about Nia? Oh, before she was even born she was promised to the son of her father's business partner. Jesus Christ. He's a billionaire and really handsome, but he's 35, you know? It's a business deal, not a romance. Yeah, that's insane. Here. Don't you think it takes all the fun out of life when you're hitched up right out of the gate? Well, it's a little safer that way. Yeah. Thanks for this. Yeah, you can send me a leaf in return. - See you soon. - All right, good night. That was fun. Anybody use you or take advantage of you in any way? No. But it's not my scene, you know? You should give the idle rich a chance. They're rather amusing. - Mary: Who is it? - It's Charlie Banks. - Hi. - Hi. What's up? Oh, nothing. Work. What about you? Yeah, the same, I guess. - Nia: Hey, Charlie. - Oh, hey. So are you doing anything right now? I'm reading "Mein Kampf" in German and I feel like my head's about to explode. You can read German? Yeah, my maternal grandmother, the baroness, taught me. Impresses the hell out of poli sci professors. Yeah, I'm sure. - What's up? - Wait, a baroness? Really? Yeah, really. Oh, wow. So what's going on? No, nothing. I was just actually coming by to see if you wanted to grab a wienerschnitzel or something. There's a guy with a tray on the lawn. He's only gonna be there for another 15 minutes. Mary, you should go. Go take a break. Yeah, no, I can't. That's really sweet, Charlie. I'm just so buried right now. I'm sorry. That's cool. I will brush up on my Germanic delicacies and I will take another shot, okay? - Okay. - All right. - I'll see you, Charlie. - All right. Don't work too hard. Mick: Yo. Yo. Mick Leary. (drops backpack) Hey. Charlie Banks. Yeah, I remember you. All right. Boojie, right? (laughs) Right? How have you been? Uh, great. Yeah. Cool. You guys got homework? - Yeah. - Yeah, we have some reading. All right, no brewing till you're done. I ain't gonna be bad influence here. Hey, you know what, Charlie? You're one lucky motherfucker you got a roommate like Danny Bowman. Where's the head? I gotta take a piss. It's down, make a left. You'll see it on the right. It's a co-ed bathroom, just so you know. Oh, yeah, that's very chic. What the fuck? I came in from my econ exam and he was sitting in the lobby waiting. He just came to get out of the city for a few days. What was wrong with the Poconos? Why would he come here? Poconos? What are you talking about? He'll get bored in a few days and split. All right? No big deal. We gotta help him avoid conflict before he leaves. Avoid conflict? Yeah, that shouldn't be-- So whose bed do I get? He came here to visit you, not me. - This one's all right. - The best. I'm gonna go to the Wick. I'll do this reading later. What? Fuck! You know how much your parents are paying for you to go here? Yeah. Okay, well, then sit your ass down and finish your fucking homework before you go out drinking. Thank God you're here, Mick. I could have ruined my entire life. Yeah, you got that right, booje. (loud music playing) Hey, there's your buddy Leo, Charlie. No, man, forget it. You don't want to hang with those guys. Mick, you're gonna fucking love this guy, actually. Danny, what are you doing? Come on, we'll give the idle rich another chance. No, yeah yeah, come on, he's right. The idle rich deserve a second chance. If they don't, who does, right? That's great. That's just-- that's great. Hey, are you Italian? - Irish. - Irish? Hey, I'm actually half-Irish, half-Jewish. Yeah? So what's that mean? You get your whiskey wholesale? (laughs) That's good. That's good. That's really good. I might steal that from you, but I will footnote you. Yeah, right. Whoa, what the fuck? Okay okay okay, forget it. Buzzy Tim, acid casualty. Buzzy Tim, hey... Gravity, gravity, gravitas. Gravy. Thanks, Buzzy. Thanks, Buzzy. All right, there you go. There you go. So you grew up with Danny? And where are you at school? I'm not. I've been thinking about taking some time off myself, to get some real-world experience before I graduate. Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, this is a great school, but it's a little bit of a culture shock when you hit the job market. Hell yeah. Yeah, it's a culture shock coming off the-- out of the job market and sitting here drinking $2 pitchers with two smoking girls like you. Danny: It's tempting. It's tempting. Man: Here you go, guys. This one's interesting. I want to say something out of Bukowski or Jim Carroll. Leo, Leo, do us all a favor and just don't say anything. And I mean that in the most sincere and affectionate terms. Okay? Here you go. Tobacco. Thanks, man. Charlie, finish your shot. Come here. - Love you, Charlie. - All right. - Cheers. Cheers. - Okay. Danny: No fucking way. No. Terry became a florist? Yeah yeah, he's doing good. His uncle got sick, so he started running the store and just kept on working. Listen, you know I got love for the guy... Me too. ...but making orders and changing products-- Yeah, I know, right? He's a dim fuck. - But he puts together a nice bouquet. - Oh, wait. Hang on. Hey. Hey. - Charlie. - What? That Mary girl is fine, right? Yeah. Danny. Hey, is she with anyone? Yeah yeah, she's with some-- some older rich Wall Street guy, I think. She used to date John Kennedy, Jr. How'd she hook up with him? Her father is a senator from Connecticut, man. No shit. Yeah. Shit yeah. Whoa. So I guess she's out of our league, huh? Yeah, way. Oh, hey... (chuckles) listen, what's a "footnote" mean? (chuckles) "Footnote"? Yeah, "footnote." "Footnote" means to give credit to somebody. - Footnote. - Yeah. That's cool. Yo. It's good to see you. It's good to see you too, Mick. Is this a good school? Yeah yeah, it's a good school. That's cool. Hey, the chicks are fine. Yeah, they are. Hey, "Deviant Behavior"-- this shit must be a blast. I didn't know someone wrote a book about me. Mick, go to sleep, all right? Please. Don't worry about anything. I'll be out of here in a couple-- Yo yo yo, come on. Go to sleep. It's okay. All right. Good night, Danny boy. Good night, Mick. - (dishes clatter) - Jesus. Sneaking out alone to breakfast, huh? What's up with that? You and Danny looked so adorable, I didn't want to wake you guys. Where is Danny? He's still sleeping. Hey, look, it's Mary. Let's go join her for breakfast, shall we? All right. - Good morning, beautiful. - Hey, Mick, Charlie. - Good morning. - I wish I could sit and eat with you, but I have to go hang my photos now. I should get to the studio. Professor Aaron will kill me if I don't get there. - I heard that guy is ruthless. - He's ruthless and impatient. But why don't you come and check it out? I would love to hear what you think. - Yeah yeah, I would love to. - Okay, great. - Don't worry. I'll get that. - Are you sure? Yeah yeah, we'll get that. Just leave it. - I'll see you later then? - Yeah, definitely. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Charlie: This guys is, like, depressed or pissed off. He's depressing me. Mary: I'm not sure I'll show him those either. Charlie: But these are fantastic. These are really great. - You like them? - Yeah, of course. You know, they're a lot like Walker Evans. Oh, wow. Thanks. - Yeah. - Wow. Who are these fucking people? They're just regular people-- portraits. I mean, they're not of celebrities or serial killers - like we see all the time. - Right. And people actually buy this stuff? They're not for sale. They're just for my Fine Arts requirement. I don't expect everyone to tell me I'm the next Walker Evans. They're great. Okay. Regular people, huh? Hey, you got your camera here? Sure. Take a picture of me and Charlie. - Okay. - We're regular, right? Come on. Mick: Take this. Mm, you know what? The light is better over here. - Charlie. - That's all right. - Come on. - Come on, Charlie. - Come on. - All right, okay. Let's do it for Mary. Okay. That's nice of you. - All right. Dude. - All right, come on. - Ready? - Mm-hmm. One more. Can I have a smile this time? - Just one, Charlie. - Okay. Thank you. All right, seriously. Hey, one more. (claps) Charlie! - Good game. - Thanks. You too. You told me that last time. You want to play? All right. - Nice block. - Thanks. Nice fucking block. Charlie: Lucky. What is Hannah Arendt referring to with the phrase "the banality of evil"? Nia. Well, she wrote in thinking that "the sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be either good or evil." Good. But what is she specifically referring to with the phrase "the banality of evil"? Charlie Banks. She was referring to Eichmann and the point that he was not some kind of mad monster, despite the nature of his atrocities, but some poor jerk whose humanity and instincts were dulled by the massive bureaucracy of the Nazis. Yeah. Yes, but I'd like to take that down the road just a little bit in asking you guys-- what are the truest forms of evil? Hang on. And are those forms always the ones which cause death? What about child molesters? What else? Cheap seats. A rat. Professor: Why? Betrayal? Because a rat just complicates a simple thing. (bell ringing) Food for thought, folks. Food for thought. - Charlie. - What? What's wrong with you? Nothing. That was cool. He's a heavy guy-- Professor Gersten. Yeah yeah, he's great. You looked smart in there too. Thanks, man. Man, if I knew college was gonna be this interesting, I might have paid a little bit more attention in school. Why didn't you? Schoolwork wasn't a priority in my house. No? What was? Hey, who are you, the Spanish fucking Inquisition? Huh? Curious fucking George-- that's you, right? Now that little bastard was always getting into some fucked-up shit, wasn't he, instead of minding his own fucking business? Yeah. My mother used to read it to me when I used to go visit her. You're just dying to ask me where I went to go visit her, aren't you, Charlie? Yeah, it crossed my mind. - Oh oh, it did cross your mind? - Yeah. That's hysterical. It crossed your mind like a little baby duck crossing the road to go swimming in the pond? You know, fuck you. Quack quack, Charlie. Come on, let's get something to eat. I'm starving. That's embarrassing. Sorry to do this to you, but I have nothing, actually. You are seriously the worst fucking poker player. - Charlie, you really do suck. - I exaggerate a little bit. It's a good thing you don't have a trust fund. - Yeah, good thing, huh, Daddy? - A great thing. Hey, where did you learn how to play cards? You're throwing money away here. I learned downtown with wiseguys. Downtown with Fat Tommy? Fat Tommy and Uncle Joe. - That's where you're from? - That's where I'm from. You don't look like a wiseguy to me. Yeah? What's a wiseguy look like? Your friend Mick. My friend Mick. Have you ever been to New York City, Antigone? You know what? I like this. This is really adorable. - Shut the fuck up. - No. Right, Mary? You're pretty cute. Excuse me. Get out of here, you broccoli head. Find anything? Oh, hey. No no, not at all. Nothing I really want. Tell me about it. How does he even live this way? Leo's life is unimaginable for anyone except Leo. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, exactly. It does seem to work for him, though. So tell me about Mick. Mick? You know what? I don't even know what he's been up to recently. He's cool but different, you know? Yeah. No, he's definitely-- he's definitely different. What? What? Nothing. Charlie, what? Are you holding out on me? Actually, I have to go to the bathroom. Excuse me. - You're adorable when you sulk. - Fuck you. - Sorry, I was looking for the bathroom. - Hey, come here. - Look at this. - Yeah. How great is this, huh? Jesus. Yeah. I'm very adaptable, or so I've been told. Ooh, wait. - Here, take these. Put them on. - Oh, shit. They're plain glass. Some drama major left them here one morning, hoping that I'd invite her back to retrieve 'em. That's amazing. It's pretty good. You know, no one would ever know. Know what? Oh, that he wasn't-- you know, that he wasn't some-- I mean, that you weren't some preppy kid from Connecticut. Take these, actually. Take it all. I'm into a new thing anyway. So if you only pack for a weekend, you might as well have some things if you stay for a bit, huh? - All right. Thanks, man. - Mary: Your deal, Leo. Yes, I'm coming. You have a tie as a belt. Yes, it's the new thing. All right. Hey, what's wrong? You losing again? Yeah, every hand. - Sit down. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. It's all in the eyes. I'm telling you. You know why no one ever calls my hand? Why? Because I have a royal straight flush working every time right here. - Let's see it. - What? Give me four aces, Charlie. You can do it. - No, man. - Hey, you want to win or not? - Yeah. All right. - All right, let's see it. All right. How's this? Wrong. No, you see, you're telling me how dangerous you are, but you want to dare me to find out for myself. Right. Okay, yeah, that's right. All right. Okay, all right. How's this? Now you look like you're confused or something. I feel confused. Right, yeah yeah. Well, it shows. Just... - Keep working on it. Yeah. - Yeah? (sighs) I feel like a new man. Mary: Wow, you look good. Mick: Yes, thank you, thank you. I'll have to footnote you. Charlie: Man, Nia's great. You know you like her. Mick: Yeah, seriously, what the fuck is your problem? Charlie: He's got this insane romantic xenophobia. What the fuck does that mean? You know, she says "to-may-to" and he says "to-mah-to." What the hell are you talking about? To-mah-toes. You're like a bunch of fucking girls. Shut up. Charlie: Okay. I think he's retarded, seriously. I gotta take a leak. (police radio chatter, car passes by) I can't go when you guys are watching me. Charlie is a pervert. - Hey. - Hey. How much did you end up winning in the last couple of hours? Yeah? - Yeah. - Good for you. Hey, why do you think Mick was hiding from the cops? I don't know. It's probably that old paranoia, you know? You know, Mick just gets weird around cops. Yeah, probably. (coughs) Hey. I'm tired. - Hey, Charlie. - Hi. - What are you working on? - I got a paper due on "Gatsby." Oh, God, I love that book. Yeah, I know, the ending kills me, though. You knew it was coming the first time you read it. Yeah, I know, but that's what makes it so wonderfully tragic. Right right. It's inevitable, but you hope against hope. Yeah. Hey, want to join our little study club? No, thanks. I gotta get to work. But you kids have fun. Hey. Hey. Hey. - What? - What are you doing? - (gasps) - Stop. - Mary, did you tag the library? - Stop. Stop. - Does this say your name? - If you write my name, I'll kill you. Mick, stop, please. (laughing) - That's not funny. - You're gonna get into trouble. Stop. I can't believe you did that. I didn't do that. It says "Mary" right there. What are you doing? How do you explain the pen in your bag? Come here. You look ridiculous. - All right, pay attention. - Okay. Make sure this is straight. Okay. Loop that with that. There. Just make sure it stays even. You look good. Leo: I hope that ride wasn't too bad for you. - Charlie: It was great. - Let's begin flight preboarding for any passengers suffering from severe sexual longing, free-floating anxiety, depression, alcoholism, inertia, turpitude, messianic fantasies, and any of the other top 40 personality crises. Sir, please be careful with the clubs. - Oh, thank you very much. - You're welcome. (thunder crashing) (engine starts) Charlie's voice: Leo realized he accidentally attended all of his classes that week and decided that we all needed to go on a road trip on his plane-- his private plane. Thank you. God, I can smell those martinis. (seagulls cawing) Mick: Do you know how to play this game? Charlie: Not really. Mick: They're all good at this shit. Charlie: Yeah, they're all rich. Rich people are good at shit like this. Mick: Fucking rich people. Charlie: Yeah. You want to play? I don't know. It seems so... gay. (Charlie chuckles) Man, it's a goof-- you'll be back in the city soon and you'll reminisce about that time you played croquet with your friends. Maybe you'll crack a little smile. That's some funny shit, Charlie. Seriously, you're killing me. Come on. All right, who wants to get their balls smacked? I think you might want to get it through there. Danny: Were Charlie and Mary out there alone together? Yes, they were. I was watching them this whole time. Hmm. Can you imagine the fucking fireworks going off in his head? Your turn. You know, I've never been naked in a hot tub with a girl before. Well, I've never been naked in a hot tub with a guy before. Hmm. Are you looking for owls, Charlie? No, I'm trying not to stare at your breasts. Oh, you are a true gentleman. Actually, if I wasn't the only one in here with you, I'd probably be sneaking some looks. Hmm, honest too. Thank you. And adorable. You're blushing. I'm not blushing. Or is it the steam? - Yeah, I think it's the steam. - Of course. I don't know. I think I'm drunk, actually. (chuckles) Why are you fucking with me? I'm not fucking with you. Can I be totally honest with you? - Sure. - Okay. When I am alone at night and I'm with myself-- I'm giving myself the gift of pleasure-- When you're jerking off. Exactly. When I am jerking off, I am thinking of you reciting "Mein Kampf" it its super-sexy mother tongue while we're making the sweetest love we can possibly make without dying. Do I need help? (laughs) Now you're fucking with me. - All right, fine. Now we're even. - Good. You slay me, Charlie, you really do. What the hell are you doing with him, Mary? - Hey. - Hey. - What the hell is going on in here? - A big sex orgy. Jump in. It's fucking hot in here. You didn't piss in the water, did you, Charlie? Hey, buddy. How are you doing? - You want winners? - No. Nia: Do you want a gun? No. Do you want a kiss? Fuck you. Good night. Fuck me? Hey. Don't let his bookish quality fool you. Charlie Banks is a surly bitch. I love that kid. You're so fine. Are you okay? Hey, you ever think about how one little decision you make can turn day into night and night into day, and suddenly everything is different just 'cause you decided to go north instead of south? North or south doesn't make a difference to me. It's more about the adventures along the way. To where? You have the most beautiful eyes, Mick. You're not asleep, are you? Yeah. No no. I couldn't sleep either. I know. It's fucking beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. I've been staring out the window almost all night. (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah, 'cause you're scared if you close your eyes it's not gonna be there when you get up, huh? A rock and a hard place, Charlie. I guess I'm the only one who can screw things up, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Fucking rich people. Yeah, fucking rich people. (camera shutter clicks) Hi. What's up? You look so hale and hardy. Do l? You made me think of my father's favorite quote? What was it? "Inflamed with the study of learning and the admiration of virtue; stirred up with high hopes of living to be brave men, and worthy patriots, dear to God, and famous to all ages." Really? I could have sworn I was drooling all over myself. Well, you developed some amazing croquet skills in one weekend. - That's pretty tough. - Yeah, thanks. Who's the quote from? Milton. My father always dredges it up when we fight about the kind of men that I date. Thanks, Charlie. Charlie's voice: Sitting there on the lawn, watching Mick immerse himself in great literature, I realized I wasn't scared of him anymore. I almost felt it was my duty to protect him. A few days after we got back to campus Leo bought himself a boat. And then things really changed. Fantastic. Charlie. Mary: Oh, Leo. Wow, there she is-- 1951, baby. You know, Charlie, I believe I've finally fallen in love. I believe I've found my passion. Yeah? She's a bit wooden, Leo, so she's right up your alley. You're a bitter one, Charlie Banks. - Mary, what do you think? - I think you're insane. Thank you. Mick. Hey, how much did you pay for this thing? Well, it would be gauche to answer, but I will anyway-- Holy shit. (seagulls cawing) Hey, yo, Charlie boy, come take a hit off this. No, thanks. Hey, are you feeling blue? I'd say green. Don't go overboard, Charlie. Yeah, 'cause it's fucking cold in that water and I'm not jumping in after your ass if you do. You are adorable, Mick. You know that? You really are. Leo: You are adorable. Charlie's voice: The spring formal was one of those lame college things we all looked down on and could happily have blown off. But Mick wouldn't hear of it. He'd even gone into town and rented himself a tux and chastised all of us for lacking school spirit. But we had to sneak in. See, despite the fact that Leo dropped 200 grand on a boat a few days before, he was adamant that none of us should pay He'd never paid before and he wasn't about to start in his fifth and potentially final year of college. I'm not sure he even caught the irony. Fucking rich people. (disco music playing) Me and you  And do the things  Ah, do the things  That we like to do  Oh, do a little dance  Make a little love  Get down tonight, get down tonight  Do a little dance  Make a little love  Get down tonight, get down tonight  Baby  I'll meet you  Same place, same time  Where we can get together  And ease up our mind  Oh, do a little dance  Make a little love  Get down tonight, get down tonight  Do a little dance  Make a little love, get down tonight...  Charlie's voice: Unfortunately, the trick to sneaking into the spring formal was finding somebody who had a key to that back entrance of the student center-- specifically, somebody eager to curry favor with dashing ne'er-do-well Leo Reilly. Oh, poor Michelle. - Hey. - (chuckles) Want a drink? Can I get that key back, Leo-- the key? - Can I get it back? - Oh. I'm not sure I have it right now, Michelle. Can I give it to you later, Michelle? Make sure, though, because if I lose that key, I'll lose my job. And I really need that job. Okay. I'll give it to you later. - Okay. - I promise. But please? Hey, Leo, you're going to hell. Seriously, there's nothing worse than playing with a desperate girl's heart. What are you doing? You got no shame, Leo. Hey, wait a minute. I thought that was a good thing. What? My love must be a kind of blind love  I can't see anyone but you  Shoo-bop shoo-bop  Shoo-bop shoo-bop  Shoo-bop shoo-bop  Shoo-bop shoo-bop  Shoo-bop shoo-bop, all the stars...  - Hey. - Danny boy. Hey, I'm looking for Charlie. Have you seen him anywhere? Yeah, I was just talking to him. He's in there. He's sulking. Why? You're fucking the girl he's in love with. All right, I gotta talk to him. - No no no, talk to me. - I'm gonna talk to Charlie, seriously. What are you doing, Mick? We'll go dance. I'm not gonna fucking dance with you. No, seriously. I'm drunk. But-- but-- What are you gonna do, Mick? I mean, what are you doing here? Are you telling me you want me to leave? No. No no no, I just-- Hi. I got an idea. What? You're gonna think I'm losing my shit. - Yeah? - Yeah. Why? What is it? Okay, so, like, I look at this-- I look at all this that you have and I think "This isn't bad. This is good." And I think maybe I could be a part of it, maybe I could do this. What, you mean, like go here, like matriculate? Yeah. Yeah, matriculate. Mick, there's things you have to do. There's tests you have to take. No, I know, I know, but maybe I could do them, whatever they are. I've been... "auditing," right? Yeah. Mary's classes. And it's not like every room is full of geniuses. Is this about Mary? Because, Mick, there's gonna be Marys wherever you go. It's the whole goddamn thing, Charlie, just all of it. Mick, I gotta tell you something. I'm the one that called the cops after you beat those guys on the roof after the party. I don't want that to be a secret anymore, all right? Watch out. Buzzy Tim's up on the roof, man. I think he's gonna fucking jump. Okay. - Man: He's up here, man. - Woman: Oh my God. Hey, yo BT, what are you doing? Charlie: Tim, hey, can we come up? Hey, you want to smoke a doobie, Tim? Tim: Don't. Derrida. Derrida. Derrida. - What's Derrida? - He's a French deconstructionist. Hey, Tim, am I gonna come up there and smoke this doob or what? Derrida. Derrida. Derrida. Truth. Tim, hey hey, it's Charlie Banks. What's the truth? Come up here. Come up here, brother man with the doobie, and yeah, let's clear a path to the truth. Derrida Derrida Derrida. Mick: How do l--? Hang on. Tim: Gravity. - Gravity. Gravitas. - Charlie: There you go. Mick: Mm-hmm. Tim. Tim: Gravy. - (people scream) - Mick: Oh shit! - Charlie. - I got you. - Are we okay up here, Charlie? - We're okay. - Pull me up. - I'm trying. Is he dead? Woman: You got him. Mick: Just be cool. - Woman: Hang on. - Charlie: Come on. Woman #2: Come on, Mick. You're gonna be okay. - Man: You got him. - Man #2: Don't move him. Woman: Come on, pull him hard. - (both panting) - Charlie: Okay. All right. Oh shit. Okay. You know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you think you're gonna die? Yeah. That's true. Mine did. How did it look? Eh-- the jury ain't in yet. Hey, what's-- what's a deconstructionist do? (chuckles) I don't know, it's like-- it's like you take something apart, right? And you see all of its threads, you know, and you see that all these threads have different meaning. And you kind of examine how these meanings were, like, imposed upon these threads. That's it? Come on, then what happens? (chuckles) I guess you kind of reveal all the contradictions and inconsistencies and you see that there's no one truth expressed by that thing. You know, you see that there's no absolute truth. (Mick exhales) No wonder he jumped. Hey. Hey, Mick... You really do slay me, Charlie. To all a good night. Nia and Danny: Good night. Good night... I hope. It's just kind of over. Hey, you know, I hate when it's over. I know you do. Mick: Fucking Buzzy Tim. Leo: A little R&R in the Poughkeepsie General Flight Deck and old Buzzy will be good as new. Oh, hey, I want to christen the boat tonight. So everybody bring a bottle and a name. I'm looking for something tragic, mythological, yet perhaps with a touch of humor. Mary: How about Humpty Dumpty? Mick: That poor little egg breaks my heart every time I think about him. Leo: I won't be mocked, seriously. Mary: No, actually I think you will be. Shit. Give me the paper. We should probably actually head-- - Leo. - Hi. Look, if I don't get that key back and I get fired, my financial aid could be affected. - You understand? - Right. I need that key back. Oh my God, I just remembered I gave it to Buzzy Tim. Wha--? Buzzy Tim's got the keys. All right? - What? - That was horrible. That was lame, Leo. Leo, they're right. That was really awful. Hey hey, I was just scatting, man. The words came out before I could sensor them. Why don't you just go tell her the truth? The girl did you a solid. I'm way too hung-over for a lecture, all right? So fuck off. Hey hey, Leo, while you're at it, why don't you tell her boss that you stole the key from her so she doesn't lose her job. That would be a lie worth telling. Are you fucking kidding me? Do I look like I'm fucking kidding you? Mick, why don't you take it easy, okay? Seriously, Mick, the noble savage routine is losing its charm. Hey, Leo. - Mick, what are you doing? Jesus. - Oh my God. - Oh my God. - Are you out of your mind? - What? - What are you doing? He's being an asshole. And he swung at me first. - Oh, he swung at you? - Jesus, Mary. It's Leo, for chrissakes. What the fuck is your problem? Nobody got hurt. It's just a thing. - Nia: Are you okay? - Mary: Let's just go. Leo, I'm sorry I smacked you, okay? Come on. Come on, he's fine. Hey, where's Mick? Jesus. I don't know. With Mary. With Mary? Listen. "Louis Kennet, April 25th--" That's the day before Mick showed up here. "--in Tommy's Trickle Down bar on 6th Avenue in Manhattan. Judy Nicodet, 24, Kennet's companion that evening, detailed the attack to detectives. According to Miss Nicodet, the assailant drove Mr. Kennet to the floor with a barstool and then jumped up and stomped on his head." Does that sound familiar, Danny? Does that sound familiar? You fucking knew about this, didn't you? You lied to me. It was self-defense. Charlie, look, he figured with his past, he'd probably better disappear, right? - I mean, that makes sense, okay? - Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. He just wanted to come up and say goodbye and that's it. - He's my friend, Charlie. - He's your friend? He's your friend? We've been friends since we were little kids. He's your friend? Then I guess you haven't lied to his face for a fucking month, Danny. I didn't know he was gonna be here this long. - I'm sorry. - I can't believe it. You can't believe it? The guy jumped him, all right? The guy jumped him. And Mick felt fucking terrible about it. - Do you think he's happy? - Yeah, I'm sure he's weeping, Danny. I'm sure he's fucking weeping. You didn't even kill this guy. You got nothing to do with this. - Not with my own hands, okay? - What the hell are you talking about? Mick swears up and down that he had no other fucking choice. - That's all he could do. - He had no choice? Fuck that. He had a choice to not stomp on the guy if he was out cold. How do you know? I'm surprised at you, Charlie. You believe everything you read? Okay. All right. I walk in for a beer, right? I see this fine girl at the bar. I give her a look. This guys she's with jumps down my throat. I walk away because I just want a beer. He gets back in my face, all right? He swung. I swung, right? But then that wasted chick starts yelling, "Shoot him, Louie." The last thing on my mind when I walked into that bar was killing anybody. I swear to God. You could have still talked to the cops. You could have told them your side of the story. Look, Mick, Charlie's got a point. Mick, fuck, man, it's in the papers. Mick, maybe you should get a lawyer now. - Exactly. - The guy at the bar who saw-- You guys can talk to the cops, not me. I was gonna take a train down to Florida 'cause I know a couple of hard guys down there who could help me go away for good. But cruising through Penn Station, I see that there's a train heading up north in five minutes. I think, "Danny boy's up there getting over." And I remember when I was a kid the Fresh Air Fund sent me to a summer camp up here with goats and cows and shit. So I just flipped a coin. You know, this place-- I listen to what I'm thinking and I'm sitting in some class or laying around with Mary, and I wonder if it's me. And then I think, "Well, maybe it is." You know? And I just-- I never would have known if l-- if I never came up here. Do you know that this is the first book I ever read cover to cover? "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." (exhales) So what am I supposed to do, Charlie? Just let my ass get dragged back? I mean, what would you do? Hey. What's going on? Hey, can I borrow a cigarette? Yeah. Thanks, man. Woman: Hey, Mick. - Hey. - I'm really slammed. - Okay, Mary, let me explain. - That was unforgiveable. It was fucked up, me hitting Leo, if you take it cold. But if you think about all of it, if you think about everything that's been going on here, and you take apart all of the threads, and you look at each individual thread-- What the hell are you talking about? Unforgiveable, Mary? No, see? It's not that simple because-- ask Charlie-- there is no absolute truth. I can't do this now. I can't. I had fun at Leo's and at the dance, but I have to write my paper now. Okay? I'm sorry. (bangs) Danny: I'm gonna go fucking nuts, all right? Give me a goddamn minute. - Danny, what about the next guy? - What fucking next guy? You're talking like he's some goddamn serial killer or some shit. Don't you think we have a responsibility? This has nothing to do with you. You understand? This has fucking nothing to do with you, Charlie. - Hey, what if he's lying? - He's not fucking lying. - What if he's lying? - Because whatever Mickey is, - he isn't a fucking liar. - That's it? That's it? - Hey, Charlie, fuck off. - That's not good enough for me. Shut up. Shut up. Fuck off, okay? Go back to the goddamn dorms and fuck off, Charlie. - Hey, Danny, Danny. - I'm fucking done, Charlie. - Danny, Danny, hold up. - I'm not listening to you anymore. I told Mick I was the one who called the police on him, all right? - You called the fucking cops? - Three years ago after the fight on the roof, I called the police. I told him last night. - Three years ago? - Yeah. - You fucking did that? - Yeah. Yes. You motherfucker, what's wrong with you? You told him? What did he say? I don't know. No, he didn't say anything. - Danny. - I can't fucking believe you. Danny, a guy fucking died, okay? A guy fucking died. A guy shouldn't have died, all right? What does that have to do with anything? You're holding this in like you've got some form of responsibility for this? Oh, Christ, Charlie, I didn't want this to have anything to do with you. - Do you understand? - Yeah. - Danny, Danny. - Nia, can I call you in a little while? - Have you seen Mick? - No. - Do you know what he did? - What did he do? He beat the shit out of Leo. What the hell is wrong with that guy? - Where's Leo? - He's home. - Where's Mary? Is she all right? - I don't know where she is. - Excuse me. - Hey, Charlie, where are you going? Mary. It's quiet in here during exams. I don't make nearly enough money without the college crowd. Still, it is very very nice to have the bar just full of regular working people, huh? (country song playing) Right? Here's to working people. What's the matter with you? You need more beer? You're usually completely naked by now. It won't matter with me  When she ran away  My world ended that day  So I don't care if tomorrow never comes.  Hey, Leo. Hey. Hey. - Hey, what's up? - Hey, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. I'm all right. - Are you sure? I've just, you know, been... - I know. I heard about that. - Nasty. I know, I know. Hey, where is Mary? Mary? She went to the liquor store. - She's at the liquor store? - We're christening the boat tonight. - We're gonna be pirates. - We're gonna be pirates? - All right. - You too, Charlie. I'll see you there. We're gonna sail into the killer fucking night! (bell dinging quietly) - (thud) - Jesus, you scared me. Are we having a party? We're supposed to christen the boat, but Leo's a little under the weather. I know. Look, like I was trying to say, I'm sorry about that. Look look, just give me another chance. Mick, it was fun, okay? We both knew how far it was gonna go. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm gonna go, okay? How far it was gonna go? I knew what this was gonna be like? Mary, please please. Please stop. - (Mary crying) No. - Stop, please. Mary: No. No. No. (Mary sobbing) I'm done with you, fucking bitch! - Mary. - Charlie: Mick. Mick. Mick. Mick, get off her. Oh, Charlie boy. Mick, what the hell are you doing? - Mary: Charlie. Charlie. - Shut up! Oh, look at you. You man up nice. That's pretty impressive. - Now let us finish our conversation. - No, she's coming with me. - Charlie: Mary. Come on. - Oh, nice. That's pretty impressive. - Mary: Charlie. - Oh, you're really on a roll, Charlie. - Charlie, help. Mick, no! - Well, let me tell you something. - Charlie: What? What? - Come here. Come here. I just want to tell you one thing-- just one thing. I already knew it was you who went to the cops. - Come on, Mick. - No no, I knew it the moment you walked in your room and saw me there, just like a big neon sign saying, "lt was me, Mick. It was me." So fuck you and fuck your big confession. But you know what, Charlie? What? You were the first rat I was ever willing to forgive, the first one. You want to know why? Yeah, why? Because you made me feel hope. - I know I did. - Yeah. Because the two of you made me believe that I could be forgiven. Yeah, I know. (laughs, groans) You know, I believed it too, Mick. I did until today. (exhales) You are a cold little bitch, Charlie. - What the fuck are you doing? - Come on, Charlie. - What the fuck are you doing? - This is it. This is your big moment. Mary: Mick, stop! Please stop. (Mick chuckles) Charlie, are you all right? Okay. Okay, Charlie. Stop it. Charlie. Charlie. - Shut the fuck up. - (screams) (bell dinging) (Mary sobbing) (distant sirens wailing) Charlie. Charlie's voice: Danny called the cops. We found out Mick was lying. Louis Kennet didn't have a gun. But Mick got away. He jumped in the river, let it sweep him south back toward the city. And he disappeared into the underworld. I've always thought that night at the marina was truly Mick's graduation ceremony. I mean, he showed mercy for the first and maybe the only time in his life.
