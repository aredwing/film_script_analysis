Yes, I'm fine. - Are you teaching today? - Yes. - Is it going to be late? - Sure, the students have an exam. - Again? - I'll try next week. You work too much. It's not good for your health. - I have to go. - Okay. "The Prestige" 'Psychotherapy Medical Center' Nong Yam is too grown-up to have an imaginary friend. I think she should have complete medical examination at the hospital. I have something to show you. Could you please tell me about Toto? I can't, because... Toto doesn't want me to tell you. Why not? Does Toto dislike mom? But mommy is not here now. Promise me that you won't tell anyone. Toto killed and buries Tok in the garden. Because he didn't want me to leave the house. Anyway... If Tok was still here, mommy will love him more than me. Please. Before it's more than just a pet. - Hello, Suthee. - I can't find my wallet. Have you seen it? No. But yesterday you went back to the hospital, right? Did you leave it there? I'll look for it there. - You're quite forgetful. - Doctor! I have to go back to work now. 'Ratanaraj Hospital' What are you looking for, professor? My wallet, I haven't found it yet. When was the last time you saw it? Forget it. - Anyway, are all students ready? - Yes. Doctor Jib, watch your uniform. Please keep it neat. Sorry. Excellent, now can you find the bicep tendon? - Is it around here? - Yes, hurry up. Prof. Suthee is coming. Are you sure this is correct? I'm following the instruction. Here it is, the flexor tendon. - Let me see. - Over here. I'm just kidding! Dr. Jib, I'm training you to be a teacher. You're not the student's friend. What's his name? - Siwapong, sir. - Siwapong? Tell him that I have to cut his score by 30 points. Due to improper behavior for a medical student. And in your case... If you can't control them, I really can't allow you to become a professor. Umm... How is Sa? I mean Usa. I haven't seen her in years. Well, she's fine. So what about professor Dararai? What should we do? Professor... Professor... About professor Dararai... Our students need to have her signature. They want to withdraw from her class. Leave it, I'll pick it up myself. You can get back to work. Please excuse me, then. Tell me which nights you're on duty. - Ae... - Huh? - Tell me which nights you're on duty. - Why? I'll find someone to live with me here. Are you scared? It's quite deserted here, but you'll get used to it after a while. Chon... did you see them? Hey, don't do this to me. Someone was murdered last week not far from here. You're joking, I don't believe you. You're so timid. Hey, hey, hey... You such a lady boy! I put these here. Can I ask you something... - What? - Whose car is that? Well... it belongs to this house's owner. Does he let you use it? Mmm... But I hardly ever drive it. He's so kind. I wanna see him. When will he be here again? He doesn't come too often. He's quite busy. Anyway, Can you find your own dormitory? I arrived here just 2 days ago, why do you want me to move out so soon? Do you want me to move already? No, but I don't know how to tell the owner of this house about you. Do you have enough spending money? - Yes. - Are you sure? Of course. Chon... Are you alright? Why? Why did you put the rice-cooker in the refrigerator? Take it out. Sorry, I forgot. - Are you OK? - Sure. It's not that important. Need any more help? Cut up these shrimps and take the shit out. Why don't you do it yourself? Ah... I'm afraid of sin! So will I be a sinner instead of you? You're already a heavy sinner. You complain like a bee-eating bear. You complain too much, just do it! - Let me ask you. - What? - Do bears like to eat bees? - I don't know. - Didn't your medical teacher teach you about these things? - Listen... I'm an engineering student, so I wouldn't know. Listen Chon, if you don't stop talking I'll eat you OK? - Don't you want to eat shrimp anymore? - No!!! Have you finished? Hey Chon!!! What are you doing? - Ouch that hurts! - Steady!! You're screaming like a girl. - What are you looking for? - Needle and nylon. Needle? For what? Are you going to stitch it yourself? - Sure. - No!! I want to see a real doctor. Quiet, I'm a doctor too. Don't you trust me? There's nothing left to say about it. Sit here, I'll go find a needle and nylon. And if someone finds you, don't tell them you're with me. Understand? Don't be stunned. Understand... Very good! What are you doing here al alone? What are you doing here? You hurt your fingers. May I have a look at your wound? It's deeply injured. Why did you come here to dress your wound? Uhh... I... When this happened you were busy cooking food, right? Yes, I was cutting shrimps, doctor. Maybe they weren't dead yet, so they took revenge. May... I ask you something. What were you actually doing? Doctor, I'm not drug addicted. I can proof that, you can test my urine sample. I'm sure you won't find anything strange in my urine. I don't use any medicines or drugs. Excuse me. Look into, and follow the light. How many fingers am I showing you? One. Three? Watch this! Use your fingers to touch your nose, and then touch my finger alternately. Yes... and then touch my finger... Yes, and touch your nose, alternately. Like this? Faster. Do you have any other symptoms like, insomnia or hallucination? I don't remember. And do you remember how many fingers I showed you? Doctor, I cut my finger. I don't think... what you're examining me is useful. Please look at this. Did I spell it correctly? Just like that. Chonlasit. Please talk to this person... maybe she can help you. - Hello. Who is she? A psychiatrist. I only cut my finger, doctor!! - Dr. Jib. - Wait. The trauma patient's waiting for you in the trauma room 1. Please wait... Just a minute. - Get out the way, please give us some space. - This way doctor. Why did you have to hide? You're a medical student here, aren't you? Why couldn't you borrow some instruments, to dress my wound? If I was caught stealing public stuff, I would have been fired. Could you look after me if I was fired? You don't need to be doing this. I just tried to help you. Can you stop complaining? Usa... Who's Usa? A psychiatrist... A shrink! This crazy doctor advise a knife-cutting patient to see a psychiatrist. Maybe when his wife is pregnant, he'll tell her to see a dentist. Chon... Have you had trouble sleeping? I... have this nightmare. What's your nightmare about? Chon... I think you should see a psychiatrist. So you think I'm crazy right? I want you to take care yourself. I don't want something happens to you. Who else can I live with. There are only two of us, sister and brother, Chon. No... Chon!! Chon! Chon, what's wrong with you!! Ae... I don't know why... I'm sorry. Go see a psychiatrist tomorrow, please! Do you want to wait until you kill me? 'Dr Chukiat Weerasakkul. Internal medicine unit' Usa 091-8999065 Just borrowing this... I'll return it to you later. Dr Usa... I really want to know who Chonlasit is. - This may affect prof. Suthee's career, and about... - Just a moment please, he's arrived. - Okay Hello Are you Dr. Usa? Yes. Please sit down. Please have some water. Thank you. Shall I... Mr. Chonlasit... May I help you? I have a frequent nightmare, doctor. What's your nightmare about? I see a murder scene. I don't know who they are. But I frequently dream about them. A woman is killed and her body is dissected into pieces. I don't know why I dream about this. But I dream about this repeatedly. It seems like a real event... not just a plain nightmare. It's absolute no ordinary dream. Do I look insane? Would you describe your feeling when you're absent-minded? It's empty... just like I'm daydreaming, but I'm still conscious. It seems like that dead woman... wants me to do something. Why do you think that? I'm not sure. You don't want your wife to see these photos, right? My name is Dararai... find me. She told me to find her. Find who? Why do you take those photo's? - Is it finished? - Yes, it's done. So what's the test result? Let me analyze the data, I'll contact you later. So I have to come back. Hello Hello 'Dararai' I won't go there again. Why not? Nothing happened. Did the doctor give you a prescription? No prescription, no treatment... Absolutely nothing. Still, you need some rest. Ae, I don't think you understand me. He said he's a second year engineering student at, Rattanaraj university. Did he say the same when he met you? I didn't ask about his personal profile. But what's interesting is, he mentioned someone to me. What was their name? Dararai... Dararai, have you heard this name before? Umm... No. Why do you ask me? He named this person and your university. So I thought you might know the name. - Hello Dr. Jib. Usa wait a minute. Sa, I'll talk to you later, I have to go now. A nurse is calling me Dararai, Rattanaraj University Division of Psychiatry and Neurology Hypnotizing for Healing Course: Dr. Dararai Suwamonkol I'm going to bed. Don't sleep to late. Yes mommy. Who's your mommy, huh? 'Dararai Suwamongkol' Chon... Chon What are you doing? What are you trying to find? Dararai. Medical Faculty. 'Rattanaraj University Psychiatry and Neurology Faculty' - Excuse me. - Yes. May I see Dr. Dararai Suwamongkol? Wait a minute. Nok, is the professor here today? Are you Dr. Dararai's teaching assistant? - Yes. - May I talk with you? Excuse me. Who're you? My name is Usa Pattanapong. Pattanapong? What are you looking for? How can you hope to find it in such a dark room? Don't you think this closet is in the wrong place? I feels like it should have been put in another location. So what? Hey, what are you trying to do? I'm trying to move it. Chon. This isn't our house. Listen, I wanna ask you something. Don't you think that maybe Dararai, is just your hallucination? Where're you going? To find an evidence that she's real. What subjects does Dr. Dararai teach? Her course is on hypnosis as a way of healing diseases. Please keep this a secret. The students here call her 'Witch'. There are so many stories about her. Like some days ago I assisted her teaching in this room, I get so frightened... just thinking about what happened on that day. This type of memory is called: 'Unconscious memory.' It occurs from an event that once impacted our unconscious mind. It can be aroused at any time, even though we've already forgotten it. - Hello I don't want to talk to you now. I've already told you. Please don't use a phone during class. I have to hang up, I'm studying. Don't you understand? I'll call you back!! So we can use this unconscious memory... to find the cause of illnesses. Illnesses both physical and mental. Physical illness can be the result of mental illness... Don't answer the phone. Tell me, what is 'Unconscious Memory'? It's a memory that... I'm sorry I didn't listen to your explanation. Could you teach me again? - Yes. - But can I pick up the phone first. No you can't!! Just let it rings. How can everyone concentrate to the lessons then? All the other students are waiting for class to start! It is disturbing the other people! Tell me, what was the most embarrassed event in your life? What are you saying? You're so annoying! Didn't your parents teach you the proper manners for living with others? You're cursing my parents now? When? A belt... Who? Dad. Don't beat me... Dad!! Let me go. Professor, please stop. Do you all understand? That's what 'Unconscious memory' means. Nothing more. And that's why the students want to withdraw from her course. Anyway, I still don't know where she has disappeared. Everyone comes to ask me, but I really don't know. Why don't you check her address from the staff register record? She's a tutorial lecturer. So we have only her name, and no personal history recorded. Why don't you ask the person who brought her here? Hmm... I don't know how to tell you. Please don't get upset if I tell you this. Why do I? Because I'm going to tell you that... It was professor Suthee who brought her here. - Excuse me. - Yes. I'd like to meet Dr. Dararai. Nok, where is... I think she's absent today. So Dr. Dararai works here, right? Sure. Nong May... finish your vegetables and go brush your teeth. Nong May! Stop playing and go brush your teeth. Be obedient to what mommy said, understand? Let's go brush your teeth, Nong May. I went to the Division of Psychiatry today. Nong May, you go first, I'll look after you later. Nothing special, I just went to find something about my patient. Really? Someone asked me about you. Who? Many... like the professor and some officers. Officers? Her name is Nok, remember? Hey, this is the concert we watched that day. Yes, it's the day you'd left me back home with our girl. Hey little cat, you can't be inside. Here I am! Where did you hide? This room is really scary. Where are you? Have you seen the doctor? No. I haven't seen him since yesterday. - Doctor, hello. - Hello. Any patients? - No one come yet. - I have some documents for you. At 3 am today... police officers were notified to the Ratanaraj University Hospital. A body found dead in the hospital museum, names: Miss Napat Duangkaew. The police found many sharp wounds on her skin. It was assumed that she may have been injured by the barbed wire in the museum. The unconfirmed cause of death in this case may have been an accident. However, the police officers have not yet come to a conclusion. They will be looking for more evidence to further confirm the cause of death. She was a teaching assistant, in the psychiatry division. Excuse me. Hi, Sa. Jib, what happened at your hospital? You must already know. It was an accident, right? Don't know yet, it's in the process of investigation. Why? Do you know her? Well, I talked with her yesterday. You're a forensic doctor, right? Yes. Follow me. The corpse is over there. I'm late, right? Do you really think this is the way to help you? Anyway... If it will make you feel better, then let's do it. But why didn't you water some other tree? This one is gonna die, it's useless to water it. Chon... where's the umbrella? What if that woman's death, was not an accident? What if she was killed? She's dead because I got her involved. Chon. Don't be so serious, it's not your fault. Yes it is, Ae! I don't know how to satisfy that Dararai woman. Chon don't do this. Chon, stop! Stop thinking about this please. I can't get it out from my head. Chon, Chon!! Sorry to keep you waiting, Sa. Jib... Why didn't you tell me about this before? I don't know how to tell you, Sa. It's about your family, I didn't want to get involved. How important is she to Thee? Actually, the professor felt guilty about this. That's all I know about Dararai. 'Suwamongkol' Prestige Clinic. Hello, is Dr. Usa there? I can't contact her mobile phone. Doctor went to Ratanaraj hospital a while ago. Okay, thank you so much. Professor tried to separate from her. I had to take Dararai's phone calls for of him. So everyone's already knew about this. No, no. I was the only one who knew. Sa... please keep this a secret. Doctor Jib. Did doctor Usa, come to see you? Yes... but she's already left. Err... Well... doctor. Do you know a woman name Dararai? Why? Her name's Dararai, do you know her? Why do you ask me? What do you want from me? Well, if you know Dararai or know anything about her, Please do not tell anyone... This is very important. Otherwise you'll be the next victim. Like that teaching assistant. 'Chonlasit case' Mommy, hi. What's wrong with you? Usa, what's wrong? Dararai Suwamongkol. She's your mistress. I've already known about it, I just didn't want you to realize. Why did you do this to me? You betrayed me. Usa... It's already over. She'll never come between us anymore. From Dararai... Subject: 'Our pictures' My name is Dararai... find me. I beg you, please let me go. I'm so scared, just leave me please. Please don't kill anyone else. Please... Ae, Ae! Ae, Ae... Let's go to the hospital, hurry up. It will happen to you. It will happen to you! It will happen to you!! Find me. Find me!! Try to find me. Hello. Yes. Yes. I'll go there. Are you Usa? He was hit by a solid object. And his body was found in a pool of strong acid. There's something else... I'd like to know from you. I found this name card at the scene. Your name and phone number were written on the card. Do you have any idea whose card this is? You don't want your wife to see these photos right? Bastard!!! I wanna see him. When will he be here again? He doesn't come here that often. He's quite busy. If you have any more evidence, please contact us. Thank you. I'd like to know this patient's address. - Hello. - Nong May. Nong May, call Nong to talk with mommy, please. Hello. - Hello, is this doctor Usa? - I'm Chonlasit, do you remember me? - Are you home? No, where are you? I'm in front of the hospital. Please hurry back, I have something important to tell you. I don't wanna talk about it, and I'm not coming. And don't call me anymore. Hello... Hello... I'll call the police if you get inside! Hello... Sister. You don't have to be afraid. Stay with me. Doctor Usa. I'm Chonlasit, remember? Where's Nong May? May... May!! Doctor Usa, please listen to me. - May!! - Take a break please. I have something to tell you Doc, the truth is very important, you have to know this! Your husband killed Dararai, because she was going to blackmail him. I'm not finished yet. Your husband also killed, Dr. Jib, and that teaching assistant. He'll kill everyone who know about his affair. I have to tell you because... Dararai wants you to know this. And right now your husband has my sister with him, so you must tell me where he is. Where is he, doctor? C'mon, doctor! He's going to kill my sister, You must tell me, doctor!!! Please no more, no more... I can't treat you anymore!! I'm going to tell you something, your older sister is death. Your sister, the one you're asking about... is dead! How do you know? You killed her. You killed everyone, you killed Jib. You killed Nok. And you killed Dararai Suwamongkol. That's not true... what are you saying? I didn't do it! The police's already known, please accept the truth. Let me help you. I didn't do it!!! Your husband did. He took my sister with him, and he's going to kill her. - You are not Chonlasit. Chonlasit is in drawer #19. Chonlasit... IS DEAD!!! Name... Chonlasit Cause of death... Severe bleeding Chonlasit Suwamongkol, 21 years old Cause of death... Severe bleeding - Attention, attention, we have a car accident patient here. Hurry!!! Chon? Are you OK, Chon? Chon! Suthee, please help him, don't let Chon die. Tell me what is going on with my brother. Chon!! Chon... Chon! Please stop, we did our best. Chon! Suthee... please keep him here. There are only two of us, sister and brother. Please don't leave me... there's no one left. Don't you think this is just your hallucination? Why did you come here to dress your wound? May I ask you something. What are you actually doing? So please look at this. Did I spell this correctly? Are you Dr. Usa? It seems like a real event, not just a plain nightmare. Someone ask me about you. Her name is... Nok, do you remember her? Stay here professor, otherwise you'll be the next victim. - She'll never come between us anymore. - You killed everyone, you killed Jib, killed Nok. And you killed Dararai Suwamongkol. Chonlasit is dead!!! I didn't do that!!! Your husband did. Court Room Number 1 And this is Dr. Suthee's electro-encephalogram, when he believes that he is Chonlasit. His blood pressure, pulse rate, and heart rate are comparatively changed. I ask for your permission to let our psychiatrist explain the situation further. The defendant has a mental illness. Which is called 'Multipersonality Disorder' It's one of the delusional disorders. The patients will create another personality or, believe that they're another person. Sometimes they'll imagine that someone is communicating with them. So it's the same as Dr. Suthee, he thinks that he's Chonlasit, and lives with his sister. Do you know anything about the murder of Dararai Suwamongkol, or any of the other victims? Yes, I do. Do you know who murdered them? Yes, I do. So can you please tell me who is the murderer? Dr. Suthee. This case, gives the rights to the accused person to be able to prove himself. We agreed to pause the case... and send him to get his trouble mind treated, and become normal once again. At which time we shall continue this case. The judgment has been delayed. Doctor... Dr. Suthee. We're taking you to the hospital. Chon. Chonlasit. Will he be cured? - Seems like he is umm... unconscious. - And he hasn't woken up yet. Like he's dreaming or sleepwalking? - Like he is hypnotized. Are you kidding me? - Do you believe me? - You're a lawyer, why do you believe me easily? Since you left, my life has changed. ALMOST FINISHED!! Still lonely, still regretful. Only silence left. Don't know how you are. Don't hear from you... since we were a parted. Suthee... Look into my eyes. Every time you hear this song... please remember our precious memories. Do you miss me whenever you're alone? But if you're going to leave me... this song will remind you, of the time, you abuse me. It will overcome you forever. Although I will have disappeared. You'll never forget me. Since you're not here, my life has changed. Still lonely, still regretful. Only silence left... I'm still thinking of you, thinking of our moments... My name is Dararai, find me! Since you left, my life has changed. Still lonely, still regretful. Only silence left... I'm still thinking of you, thinking of our moments... But now I feel so lonely, I'm missing you, you know? I'm missing you whenever I'm alone... I forgive you. I'll release you now. - Jan de Uitvreter -
