You're the first white man we've seen in three months. You two are the first I've seen in 40 years. My name is Glendon. This is my assistant, Hugh Renwick. We're botanists. He's a botanist. I'm a nobody he brought along out of kindness. I wanted to see the last places on earth. Why are you here? We're looking for the Mariphasa lupina lumina... a strange flower which grows only in Tibet... and which, it is said, takes its life from the moon. Is there really such a flower, Father? There are some things it is better not to bother with. Why do you say that, Father? - You aren't afraid, are you? - No. But I respect some of the superstitions of others. Often they are founded in fact. Our coolies tell us, the valley we want to see is filled with demons. Yes, I'm afraid they thought you were one of them. That's why they ran away. I've never been into that valley... and I've never known a man to return from it. Then we were right. This is the place. According to this map, it's just beyond that ridge... just off the trail. - Are you game? - Wish us luck, Father. - Get the ponies. - Right. You are foolish... but without fools there would be no wisdom. Pax vobiscum. Thank you, Father. Think of all the trouble we've been through these past six months... just for the sake of a little flower. Yes. But it's the only one of its kind in the whole worid. We're going to go on climbing. I say, Glendon! What? I can't move! Something's holding my feet! Nonsense. Lift them. Come on. - Are you all right now? - I seem to be. - What was the matter? - I don't know. It's the strangest feeling. The sort you have in a dream. Your feet won't move. Don't let it get you, old boy. Autosuggestion, self-hypnosis: The basis of all superstition. What happened? Something struck me. Wilfred, what are you doing? Sorry, dear. I lost all track of time. Everybody's asking for you. I've been working on an experiment. What's the matter? Is something wrong? I mean, am I all right? Dear old bear. Nothing interests you anymore... except your mouldy old secrets in there. Not even your wife. I promise you, my darling... that as soon as I've completed that experiment... I'll try to be more... Well, more human. It isn't in you. Ever since you came back from Tibet... I've felt you were planning to divorce me and marry a laboratory. I'll not only divorce you, but I'll beat you as well... if ever again you get me mixed up in a mess like this. Don't blame me. Blame the Botanical Society. I know, but I... Here's Aunt Ettie. Let's get out... or she'll be battering down the doors. I'll have no secrets left. Wilfred, how sweet of you to let us all in on you today this way. Can you really make artificial moonlight? I can't wait until I see your new laboratory. Deadline, Aunt Ettie. He won't even let me go in there. Oh, Chanel. Sweet. But you look a bit down. What's the matter, Lisa? My dear wife has just been scolding me. Yes, how you manage to keep your dear wife is a mystery to me. Skirmishing off the way you do. Leaving her alone, months on end. Anyhow, I knew the risk I took when I married... one of the black Glendons of Malvern. Marrying any man is risky. Marrying a famous man is kissing catastrophe. Come on, Wilfred. See you later, Aunt Ettie. Good heavens! What is that wicked thing doing? It trapped that poor, dear little fly. It's going to eat that poor, dear little fly. How revolting. I wonder where is that horrible Madagascar plant? The one that eats mice and men. Mice and spiders, Miss Ettie. It's over there. Shall we take a look? - They'll be feeding it soon. - No. I'll have my own tea first. I may lose it after I've seen the thing... but I shall have it anyway. Please don't yank me, Paul. It irritates me to be yanked. I'm sorry, Granny. But I've just seen someone I want to speak to. There she is. Alice, darling. Oh, my dear, how are you? - Do you know Mr. Renwick? - How do you do? - Mr... - How do you do, Ames? I must have my tea, quick. My tongue is hanging out. You do pick up the oddest phrases, don't you, Ettie? I got that one from your delightful grandson here. You take Lady Forsythe. I'll take Capt... - Ames. - Of course. I never knew anyone... who could scuttle about as quickly as Ettie Coombes can. Lisa. Here's a young man who says he used to be a beau of yours. Paul! I read you were in England. I wondered if... Lisa, how great to see you again. I simply adore to travel. Simply adore it. He used to be a beau of hers. I say, you've got a lovely garden here. Haven't we? I simply jitter to go to Java. Simply jitter. Yes. "Simply jitter to go to Java. "I simply jitter to go to Java." Wilfred, I want you to meet a very dear friend, Paul Ames. How do you do, sir? Mrs. Glendon and I used to throw jam in each other's hair as kids... and sail off the stable roof on improvised parachutes. I've heard about your more recent exploits, as everyone has. My wife never told me that she knew you. - We've known one another for ages. - Yes, quite a time. Oh, yes. He proposed to her once. When I was six, and he was twelve. That was ages ago. Are you planning on staying in England long? No. I return to California on the fourth. I've made my home there. How does it feel to have a flying school of one's own? To be able to hop across from San Francisco to Tokio... in the twinkling of an eye? At this moment, I ask nothing more of life. Really? A very enchanting mood to be in: To ask nothing more of life. Are you in that mood, Lisa? Anyway, I'm in that mood. All these lovely flowers about. How true. Only God can make a daffodil. The poet said, "Only God can make a tree," Aunt Ettie. Isn't it just as difficult to make a daffodil, Wilfred? Much more so. Here's a nice, fat frog for you, my dear Carnelia. Here we are. Ettie Coombes, what's happened? - A plant just ate a frog. - A what? - A what? - Frog. Heretic! Bringing a beastly thing like that into Christian England. Nature is very tolerant, sir. She has no creeds. Quite so. May I congratulate you, sir... on the amazing collection of plants you've assembled here. Thank you. Evolution was in a strange mood... - when that creation came along. - Yes. It makes one wonder... just where the plant worid leaves off... and the animal worid begins. Have I met you before, sir? In Tibet, once. But only for a moment... - in the dark. - In the dark? Let me introduce myself again. DR. YOGAMl: I am Dr. Yogami. How do you do, sir? Like yourself, a student, a nurturist of plants. Dr. Yogami. Pardon? Do I understand you to say, that we met in Tibet? Yes. And unless I'm mistaken, we were both on a similar mission. Yes? Would it be intrusive if I should ask you... - if you were successful? - In what? In obtaining a specimen... of the Mariphasa lumina lupina: The phosphorescent wolf flower. Well, you know... it blooms only under the rays of the moon. My specimens died on the journey back. As a scientist, sir, as a botanist... you actually believe that this flower... - takes its life from moonlight? - I do. So far I've been unsuccessful... in persuading mine to bloom by moonlight... or any other kind of light. Let me see them. I'm very sorry. I'll have to ask you to excuse me. May I go along with you? Lee! - You'll pardon me? - Of course. No one's called me Lee for years. So what's happened to you? You were the gayest, happiest creature in the worid once. What's happened to you? I have a toothache today. I never seem to be able to rise above a toothache. It makes me want to howl, break things... pull noses, tweak ears, screech. Yes, you were always a good screecher as a child. But I'll say this for you, you were truthful. I'd hate to see you turn into a liar. Liar? Yes, it isn't a toothache that's troubling you today. Won't you tell an old pal how to help? How? - Shut up. - I see. It's been great seeing you. Now I'd better go and find Wilfred. He's probably looking everywhere for me. I can't bear to see you change like this. You, who used to rear at the drop of a hat. A wild pair we were, weren't we? High-headed, hard at the bit, quick with the heels. How we used to fight. Remember? Yes. Where's all that lovely fight gone? There's been no fight in me since the night we broke things off. This flower is an antidote for what? Werewolfery. Lycanthrophobia is the medical term... for the affliction I speak of. And do you expect me to believe that a man so affected... actually becomes a wolf... under the influence of the full moon? No. The werewolf is neither man nor wolf... but a satanic creature, with the worst qualities of both. I'm afraid, sir, that I gave up my belief in goblins, witches... personal devils, and werewolves... at the age of six. But that does not alter the fact... that in workaday, modern London today... at this very moment... there are two cases of werewolfery known to me. And how did these unfortunate gentlemen... contract this medieval unpleasantness? From the bite of another werewolf. These men are doomed but for this flower... the Mariphasa. There you are, Wilfred. - Your wife? - Yes. This is my wife. Dr. Yogami. How do you do? May I visit your conservatories again one day? - Of course, yes. - Thank you. What a strange man. Yes. See, man. See that moon vine. That only blooms at night. If I've deceived that vine, surely I can deceive Mariphasa! I don't know, sir. I got a feeling that Mariphasa ain't a human plant, sir... not like this vine. Look. Look, man! What did I tell you? And these two buds should bloom before tonight. Hawkins, go and get your dinner. Dinner, sir? Go. Get out. You make me nervous. Don't stand there staring at me all solemn and owl-eyed. Yes, sir. Certainly. Of course, Mr. Plympton, you being a mere indoor person... has no idea of the mysteries of nature. Most interesting, what you've been telling me, Mr. Hawkins. And so them rings make moonlight, do they? You have the idea, Mr. Plympton, in a manner of speaking. Not that it's easy to grasp. But there's a very scary thought, if you come to consider it. Yes? And what might that be? It don't leave nothing for heaven to do. Quite so. If you please, not on the glass, thank you. Now, perhaps, you'll be good enough to go and tell Dr. Glendon... the missus is hoping he'll come in for tea. Not a chance, I assure you, of his coming. - Not a chance, Mr. Hawkins? - Not a chance, Mr. Plympton. Upstart. Did you speak, Mr. Hawkins? I did, Mr. Plympton, but not to you. More tea? No, thanks. - No, thank you. - No, dear. I have to get back to London before the evening traffic starts. I'll never forgive you, Lisa, if you don't come to my party tonight. Everyone in the worid will be there. Definitely everyone in the worid. I'd love to come... but it's impossible to get Wilfred to go anywhere. Forget Wilfred. Why don't you invite Paul to stay on for dinner? And let him drive you into town afterwards. - Yes, why don't you? - I do. I stay. Ettie, dear, how did you find your new home? I happened on it district visiting. Come, darling. Queen Elizabeth stayed there one night. It's right on the river, in the midst of the sweetest slums. So individual: Murderer's dens on one side, pubs on the other. Is your party buffet or sit-down? Buffet. The house is too small for sit-down. How I loathe buffets. Last week at Eva Trippet's... I sat on a plate of salad, and no one told me. What's the matter with you? Stop it. Dr. Yogami. How do you do? Is Dr. Glendon at home? My husband is working on an experiment. He can't see anyone. - Perhaps I can see him later? - I'm afraid not. Lisa, who is this interesting-looking man? Introduce him to me at once. Dr. Yogami, my aunt, Miss Coombes. - How do you do? - I noticed you... at the botanical garden party and wondered who you were. You must come to my party tonight. Just a free and easy musical at my little bandbox in the slums. Thank you, but I'm far too busy a man for pleasure. Nonsense. Very busy men come to my parties. Positively the busiest. Lady Forsythe is bringing her son. Could you find a busier man in all London... than the Chief of Scotland Yard? Time to scuttle, Ettie. I must go. I'll see you tonight, Dr. Yokohama. Dr. Yogami, didn't they tell you that I wasn't seeing anyone today? I thought, perhaps, you might see me. - Come another day, please. - Another day would be too late. What will happen before morning, I cannot say. Tonight is the first night of the full moon. Still harping on that old wives' tale of yours? Would it were an old wives' tale. Exactly what do you want of me? Two blossoms of the Mariphasa flower in there... - would save two souls tonight. - Tonight? But I thought you said the Mariphasa was a cure. No. An antidote. Effective only for a few hours. Won't you let me see the results of your experiment? Sorry. When my experiments are completed... I will show the results to the entire worid. Not before. Now, sir, I must wish you good day. DR. YOGAMl: Then there is nothing more to be said? Nothing. Good day. But remember this, Dr. Glendon. The werewolf instinctively seeks to kill... the thing it loves best. Come in. We're leaving now, Wilfred. We? I know it's a little early... but Paul wants to stop at his flat and change. Had you planned on getting home? Naturally, I shall get Lee back. Yes, of course. Thank you. Darling, won't you change your mind and come with us? I listened to all the childhood memories... I care to hear for one night. Run along, dear. Run along and enjoy yourself. I want you to see what I've done with that brocade you brought me. Put off those beastly lights, I tell you! Wilfred, what on earth's the matter? Sorry, darling. I've been putting some medicine in my eyes... and the lights hurt them. I just wanted you to see my coat. Some other time, please. Good night, Wilfred. Good night. Good night, Dr. Glendon. Good night, sir. Lisa. Good night, my darling. Scenes that are brightest May charm awhile Hearts which are brightest And eyes that smile Lisa! Get off my train! I hate it when I step on a train. I shall take you home in a minute. - Alice, my dear. - Oh, my dear. How amazing of you to succeed in bringing your son. She's singing Scenes That Are Brightest. She sings Botticelli divinely. One doesn't sing Botticelli. One paints him. Oh, yes. I forgot for the moment. Lisa, dear. Charming. Paul, so good of you. You two deep men should know each other. Col. Forsythe, this is Dr. Yokohama. We've met somewhere. Yes. Don't you just love moonlight, Dr. Yokohama? Makes everything so peaceful. Isn't it romantic to have the Thames lapping at your very threshold? Sings me to sleep every night, positively. That's the worst district in London over there. Knife you for a shilling, positively. But what difference? I always say, everything is fate. Don't you agree with me? What's that? A lost soul perhaps. Let's go in. What is it, Hugh? Just a dog, out for a little or no good. It isn't a dog. It's a lost soul. I think we'd better get her upstairs, don't you? My aunt is feeling a little ill, Dr. Yogami. You know, you're a naughty girl. Ettie Coombes, what's the matter with you? One shouldn't drink at one's own parties. But I get so nervous. Ettie Coombes, you should go on the water wagon. Now, you come along to bed. Don't worry. You'll be perfectly all right in the morning. I'm so nervous. I want to lie down. Nothing to be nervous of. Here we are. Get to bed. You'll be okay in the morning. I've been so frightened. Open the window. Yes, of course I will. Air will do her good. Do you know she's nearly asleep now? Come on. Let's go. What's that horrible sound? What is it? Well, if I were back on the ranch... I'd say it was a coyote with a bad dream. But in London, I don't know. Can't tell me that's a dog. You are quite right. It isn't a dog. I say, you're trembling. All right, I'll go. Don't go up there, Mrs. Glendon. Don't let any of the women come upstairs. Just a moment. If you'll all stand back. What's the matter in here? What's wrong? The devil's been here. He had green eyes. He clawed at me. He was covered with hair. There, there. You've had a bad nightmare, that's all. If anyone dares to tell me I've been dreaming... I shan't answer for the consequences. Nobody will. Come along. You'll be much better if you sit down. You sit down here. You'll be all right. My wicked woridliness has caught up with me at last. The Babu of Goroka always said it would. There. Never mind. I'm not here in my official capacity... but I think I can say with conviction... that no devil or any man has come through this window tonight. Yes. I think our hostess has been mixing her drinks. That's a very excellent deduction. A horrible feeling. I've been like it myself. We all do it at times. It's getting quite late. The party must be over. Shall we have one before we go? I'll have one. - Lee, I'll wait for you. - All right. Can I drop you anywhere? - Anything else, sir? - Nothing. This flower looks to have slipped off and died on its own. Whatever is it, sir? I've never seen nothing like it. Let that flower alone! I meant no harm, sir. It's only that I'm so fond of flowers... my fingers always want to touch them. I'm sorry, Millie. Here. Take these and buy yourself a pot of primroses or something. Thank you, sir. Go on, Jenkins. You heard the cries... and you ran in the direction from which they came. Yes, sir. And bloodcurdling they was. I took off as fast as anybody could... that was suffering from broken arches. Broken arches acquired in the line of duty, sir. It was some minutes before you located the fatality? Good morning. I'm a little early. No. Did you see the papers? No. Just read this. Go on, Jenkins. At Goose Lane, me arches crack, and I come a cropper. - Go on. - Then I see what I see. My stomach takes such a turn, my arches crack again. Goose Lane. This thing must have happened near Miss Ettie's house. Yes, quite near. There were wounds on the girl's throat... a wild animal might have made. Well, if that wasn't a wolf I heard baying last night, I'm crazy. You know, our dear Aunt Ettie... may not have mixed her drinks as badly as we thought. In view of this occurrence... I'm inclined to wonder myself whether there's any connection. But whatever Miss Coombes saw, it wasn't a wolf. No. Not in London. You may be sure of that. I see I can't help you. But I've only one other brilliant suggestion to make. How about a werewolf then? This is Scotland Yard, my boy, not Grimm's Fairy Tales. "There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio." You know. It's a funny thing. When I was flying in Yucatn last year... - the authorities went cuckoo over... - Who? I beg your pardon, sir. I mean, the authorities were gravely concerned... with a series of murders, not unlike this one... and they were always preceded by the howling of a wolf. And then one night... they shot something slinking through the hills... and the murders ceased. - They said it was a werewolf. - Who were they? All right. But if any more of your citizens are found stark and cold... just remember, nephew warned you. I think I might be able to persuade Wilfred to go, too. Yes. Anyhow I'll expect you, Paul. Dinner at 8:00. Goodbye. Good morning, Wilfred. Good morning, dear. I've just been talking to Paul. He suggests that we all go for a moonlight ride tonight. I'm sorry. I can't go. There's something wrong, darling. Very, very wrong. Why do you say that? Won't you tell me what it is? Nothing. I shall be all right. I wish we could burn that wretched laboratory... and everything in it. Darling, you're not happy. I know when you used to work... you were single-tracked and absorbed. But you were thrilled, excited. Now something about you frightens me. Lisa, you mustn't say such things. You're short-tempered with me now. You never used to be. You seem to have found someone sufficiently pleasant... to make up for it. You're being utterly hateful. I'm sorry. Just bear with me a little while longer. You really want me to go on that ride tonight? - If you only knew how much. - All right, then. I'll go. I do love you, Lisa. You know that, don't you? Hawkins. Yes, sir. Coming, sir. You called, sir? Hawkins, I've got to get away for tonight. I want you to watch over things very carefully. Yes, sir. I promise you, no more flowers will be stolen. That I can and will promise you, sir. But this bud, sir. The moon lamp, it don't seem to bring it out, does it? No. Well, sir, the real moon will be out in a couple of hours. Maybe that'll bring it out all right, sir. That'll be too late, Hawkins. That'll be too late. I want you to keep the moon ray going. Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. Wilfred, we'll have to hurry... if we want to see the moon rise over the Downs. I can't go. I've to go down to Leicestershire for a few days to see Bransby. I'm sorry, sir. I've just had a wire from him about a shipment of bulbs from Burma. Can't you put it off until tomorrow, and ride tonight? I can't. And you're not to go riding, either. What? - I forbid it, do you hear? - Forbid it? I can't have my wife gallivanting around the country... in the moonlight, with a total stranger. Hardly that, Dr. Glendon. I planned to ride, Wilfred, and I intend to ride. Very well. If you must... then promise me that you'll get back before the moon rises. Promise me that. I'll promise you nothing of the sort. I shall ride tonight, tomorrow night, the next night... in fact, every night there's a moon. Come, Paul. Don't go. Of course I'm going. - Here's to you, Mrs. Moncaster. - And here's to you, Mrs. Whack. That's the first I've had today. - How's your son, dearie? - He's doing splendid. Did I tell you he was a foreman in a pants factory? - No. - Yes. And the warden says he's the best prisoner he's ever had... in the penitentiary. I always knew that boy would amount to something. Is your tripe tough, Mrs. Moncaster? - Not at all. - Mine is. It ain't tripe you're eating. It's your veil. Oh, Lord. I want two gins for two ladies. Two ladies? Where's the other lady? Man, what's the matter with your sight? I'm the both of them. I beg your pardon. Could you tell me of anyone in this neighbourhood with rooms to let? Try Mrs. Moncaster in there... the lady with the feathers, eating the plate of tripe. - Thank you. - He seems to have a secret sorrow. Which one of you ladies has rooms? I have. And most reasonable. Three shillings a week for a gentleman. And the rooms is splendid. Don't you pay attention to the lying old hypocrite, sir. Now, my rooms is... That's my dearest friend, Mrs. Whack. But she don't understand the ethics of business. Now, are your intentions by the night or by the week? - I'll take the room by the week. - Then this way, sir. It's just across the court. Right here. This way. If you'll follow me, sir. It's going to be a fine night after all. I do hate taking my plumes out in the wet. Are you a single gentleman, sir? Singularly single, madam. More single than I ever realised is possible for a human being to be. You don't say. What would you say, if I were to tell you that it was possible... for a man to turn into a werewolf? I'd say I was Little Red Riding Hood. There's my gilt and splendid parlour, sir. You're single, and I'm single. Ain't that a coincidence? Ten years I was married to Moncaster. Ain't seen him in 20. He run away to Australia. What a man he was. Used to come home from his work all portered up... hit the baby with the plate, throw the gravy in the grate... spear the canary with a fork. And with his heavy hobnail boots... black-and-blue me from head to foot... and all because I forgot to have crackling on the pork. Here's your room, sir. Don't let this happen to me. Father in Heaven, don't let this happen to me again. If it must happen, keep me here. Keep me away from Lisa. Keep me away from the thing I love. Mrs. Moncaster. Oh, you poor dear. I'm sorry I hit you, Mrs. Whack. Say no more about that, Mrs. Moncaster. What's going on here? He grips me, swipes me, swats me one in the breadbasket... and slams the door in me face. Do you call that a gentleman? I thought perhaps you might want some help. That's why I come in. Strange noises have been coming from his room, Mrs. Whack. I don't know what I've let myself in for. I'd use me passkey and have a look. Take a peek through the keyhole first. Where have you been? I've been waiting more than Them wolves have been acting queerly all night. Hear them? Wolves is nothing to me. Give me a nice kiss, Alf. I hadn't ought to do this. Me with a wife and kids. But you don't love your wife and your kids. You love me. Them blasted wolves. What's the matter with them tonight? What a fool you are. A young fellow like you... tied to a white-faced, whimpering, scarecrow of a woman. But you're going to leave her and come with me, ain't you? Maybe. Wait a minute. I've got to see what's happening. Why, Mrs. Whack, what keeps you up so late? I felt I couldn't go to bed, ngel... without coming back to see how you was. I ain't exactly bubbling. - Is he back? - Vanished as if he was air. He must have been a hairy man. I suppose you don't happen to have a nip about you anywhere. No. Ain't it unfortunate? He's back. How did he get in? I been sitting here all night. Better go up and see what he's about now. Put your eye to the keyhole. And you keep off my jaw, Mrs. Whack. Why, Mrs... Mrs. Whack. What is it? Come here. Look. Pull yourself together. Come on. I wonder if you saw what I saw... or if I saw what you saw. And I better run for the police. No. We've seen something better left unsaid to the police. - They might say we've been drinking. - Maybe we have. By any chance, did you find a bottle? No, my love. But if I saw what I thought I saw... I've had my last bottle. And it had better be the same with you. Now, I'm speaking to you as a sister to a sister. That's right. Now, that's... Let's get inside. Shut it out. Sorry, Tom. Nice doings at the zoo. What does The Herald say? Usual thing: "What's the matter with Scotland Yard?" What do the papers think we are? The eyes that see all? Old Forsythe's bobbing up and down like a balloon that can't land. And, Evans. Yes, sir. If I don't get a definite report on both these atrocities by 6:00 p. M... I promise you, you'll all be seeking new professions by tomorrow morning. - Good day. - Good day, sir. Uncle, this is Dr. Yogami of the University of Carpathia. Sit down. YOGAMl: Thank you. Ever since the other night, I've been wondering where I met you. I called on you seven years ago... to enlist the resources of Scotland Yard... for an unfortunate mortal afflicted with lycanthrophobia. Yes. I recall it. You thought I was mad. What can we do for you now? Your department is trying to solve two murders. There will be other murders tonight, and tomorrow night. Also next month, when the moon is full again... unless you realise, sir, there is a werewolf abroad in London. Yes, my nephew has similar ideas. What do you want us to do about it? You must seize the only specimen of the Mariphasa plant in England. And where shall I get this posy? In the private laboratory of Dr. Wilfred Glendon. That flower is the only known antidote for werewolfery. Yes, a very interesting folktale... but of no value to the police. I warn you, sir... unless you secure this plant... and discover the secret of nurturing it in this country... there'll be an epidemic... that will turn London into a shambles. We'll take precautions for the protection of London. There is a wolf wandering about, but not the supernatural one. That, I think, disposes of our murders. But that wolf escaped last night. That wolf will be captured. But the murder in Goose Lane was two nights ago. Do not worry about the animal from the zoo. Whether you catch it or not, will not matter much... tonight. Why, sir, you give me quite a start, sir. That one bud, sir, it seems rather stubborn. It doesn't seem to want to come out, does it, sir? I'm afraid it's no use, Hawkins. It will only need another night. Another night? Why, sir... you look as if it was a matter of life and death, sir. Perhaps we can speed it up, sir. At least we can try, can't we? - You never fail me, do you, Hawkins? - No, sir. Listen. I haven't been here. - You haven't seen me. - Why, of course not, sir. I've got to get away. Immediately. I can't stay here. I can't stay here with this stubborn Mariphasa. Why, Mr. Glendon, whatever brings you here? - I'm spending the night here. - I am glad, sir. And my wife will be happy to cook one more supper for you, sir. I don't want anyone to know that I'm here. Not even Mrs. Timothy. I want to be alone. I want to get away from Glendon Manor... away from my work, away from people. I want to be alone and think. You've often wanted to be alone and think, haven't you, Timothy? Yes, sir, but Mrs. Timothy will be awful disappointed, sir. You know, she's always talking about the old days... when Miss Lisa's mother and father was alive... and you would come courting here. Hello, old fellow. You remember me, don't you? He seems glad to see me, Timothy. Yes. Beans remembers the old days, too, sir. Do you know where I'm going to spend the night? I was thinking of airing out the best room in the west wing, sir. No, don't do that. I'm going to the Monk's Rest. You can't do that, sir. Why, it ain't been open for years. Nevertheless, that's where I'm going to spend the night. You see, Miss Lisa and I, we miss the old times, too. Thank you, Timothy. Why, there ain't even a bed, sir. I shan't need a bed, Timothy. - You'll be cold, I'm afraid, sir. - If I am, I shall build a fire. Here's the key, sir. - Lock me in, Timothy. - Pardon, sir? Lock me in. Don't open that door before sunrise. Even if I call, pay no attention to it. Keep that door locked till dawn. Good night. Good night, sir. There it is, Paul. You can just see it through the trees. Dear old Falden. I couldn't go back to America without one look at it. Let's get out of the car here and walk. All right. Lee, I can't tell you how strange it seems coming back here... after all these years. This is where we used to hunt for birds' eggs. Remember? And this is where I proposed to you. Do you remember that? And then a bumblebee stung you. How funny you looked. My dear, I can't tell you how good it is to hear you laugh again. Lee, I love you so much. Always have, always will. Don't say that, Paul. You promised you wouldn't. We've been through it all before. It's no use. But you're horribly, miserably unhappy. Anyone can see that. It's you who are making me unhappy, Paul. Couldn't you care for me again? I wouldn't tell you if I could. I don't know why, Lee... but I'm frightened for you. Terribly frightened. Don't be silly. I can still beat you to the Monk's Tower. It's on. I'll give you a 10-yard start. Off you go. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I've won! So you've seen this monster before? Yes. There was something grotesquely familiar about it. Then it suddenly struck me. It was Wilfred Glendon. Paul, pull yourself together. Do you realise what you're accusing Glendon of? A man I've known all his life. I repeat, sir. I fought with Wilfred Glendon, a werewolf. Where is Mrs. Glendon now? At home, doors and windows locked. Miss Coombes is with her. They promised not to leave the room until I got back. Very well. I'll go to Glendon Manor in my official capacity. But I'm going to form my own conclusions... - from what I see and hear. - All right. We've just found another victim of this monstrous murderer: A chambermaid at the Bedlington Hotel... - killed some time last night. - Very well. I'll be over. There you are. There's your werewolf for you. Unless it had seven-league boots... it couldn't get to the Bedlington Hotel... I'll tell you what. We'll go to the hotel... and after that, if necessary, we'll go to Glendon Manor. I think it'll be necessary. Usual thing. The place smelled like a kennel when we came in. You can still notice it. Who occupied the room? The guest's name was a Dr. Yogami, sir. The same kind of lacerations? Exactly, sir. Yeah. Look, sir. I just found these in the wastepaper basket. I've never seen a flower like it before, have you? No. Yogami spoke of some rare plant that Glendon had. This must be it. Buck up, my boy. You're not such a fool. We'll drive down to Glendon Manor at once. Right. I'll get my hat. Dr. Glendon is not at home, sir. - Was he here last night? - I think not, sir. Have you heard from Dr. Glendon? No, we haven't heard a word from him. Has Hawkins seen him? No. He is not in the laboratory. - Are you all right, Lisa? - Yes. Don't worry. Keep your door locked. No report from the East End, sir. No report from Yogami's apartment, sir. We've heard nothing of Dr. Yogami. Three men at Glendon's. Yes. No, we're not afraid. Glendon has not passed through Richmond. Headquarters. No station reports any trace of Dr. Glendon. - Dr. Glendon! - Quiet. Help me up. The police have been searching everywhere for you. I know. The Mariphasa, has it bloomed yet? No, but it's going to bloom. That'll be all. You needn't mention you've seen me. No, sir. Of course not. Yogami! You brought this on me... that night in Tibet. I'm sorry I can't share this with you. Relax, Lisa. Relax. Quick. Col. Forsythe. Col. Forsythe has left for Glendon Manor, madam. It's Lisa. Don't you know me? Wilfred! Thanks for the bullet. It was the only way. In a few moments now... I shall know why all of this had to be. Lisa, goodbye. Goodbye, Lisa. I'm sorry... I couldn't have made you happier. In my report, I shall say... that I shot him by accident... while he was trying to protect his wife.
