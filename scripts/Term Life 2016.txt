I got ties... There's a few rules to keep in mind when planning a job. Scarves, hats! The easiest place to hide is in plain sight. - Got it. - Whatcha got, sir, huh? I got ties! I got fedoras! Design the job in a way so that no one gets hurt. Timing is everything. Let's go! Step up! Finally, every mark has a weakness that can be exploited. You just gotta find it. - Yeah? - It's Alejandro. I am interested in the job. Are you ready to meet? I am now. The criminal underworld is a complicated ecosystem. Everyone relies on each other just to survive. It all starts with your bottom feeders. They're always on the lookout for opportunities. They find the job. This guy is Jimmy Lincoln. Then it moves up to me. I design the plan of how to pull off the heist. Every little detail, inside and out. And finally at the top sits the buyer, the one who actually pulls off the job and takes all the risk. $30,000 up front. 30,000. I tell you how to get in. I tell you how to get out. Everything in between is on you. So we just gotta trust you. Is that it? Listen to me, Nick. If you want my money, I'm going to need something more reassuring than that. Alejandro, I'm not here to talk you into this. I'm here to let you do this. It's yes or no. The 250,000 is in an evidence locker at the Fulton county courthouse, and I'm gonna tell you how to take it. If something unexpected happens? If I do my job right, it won't. And if it does? Doesn't come with a money-back guarantee, kid. But having said that, I make sure you go in with everything that you need... Access codes, schematics, schedules, equipment. Once we start, how much time do we have to get to the spot? Fifteen minutes. It's tight but doable. You miss your window, that's it. You want a second chance, I start all over. You pay me again. Oh, boy, you better be good. Look, guys, this is like nothing that you've ever done before. The timing here is everything. Once you start, you cannot stop. And once we're there? You will have exactly the amount of time it takes a traffic light to go from green to red and back again... Three minutes. I want you to think of it like it's a, uh... A magic trick. Half of it is engineering. And the other half? Magic. Freeze! Clear! What the hell's going on? Is your cargo secure? Cargo, uh? My rig's empty. I'm here to pick up. Whoo-hoo! Pack it up. I was fucked, and I didn't even know it. Perhaps the reason any of this happened is because I was distracted. Catherine Jill Barrow, otherwise known as Cate, my daughter. Sure, she could pick me out of a crowd, but we never really spent any time together. No one loves that kid more than me, but our situation is a little, uh... Complicated. Our boss wants to renegotiate. You're not getting a dime from me. So the deal is this... I protect her and provide from afar, while my ex, Lucy, takes care of the day-to-day. Keep my world out of her world. It's better for everyone the more I stay removed, especially Cate. She's a good kid. She's growing up right. But she just turned 16 and developed a complete lack of judgment. The charge was underage drinking, hardly a high crime, but I'd like her to have a direction. One thing's for sure... I want her to have a better life. In my line of work, there's not many people you can trust for advice. Thankfully, I have Harper. He got me into this business, and he's my best friend. Still hanging out with cops? Murph is one of the most respected guys on the force. We've known each other since we were kids. He's still a cop. Makes me nervous. Good. We're crooks. They should make you nervous. When you get older and wiser, you'll realize that's why I play poker with them. Look, harp, I came here to talk to you about something. What, about your bad haircut? Don't start with my hair again. I like my hair. It's perfect. Perfect. It's current. I blend in. I look like a regular guy at Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, 1972 maybe. Okay, can we get out of here? I am here to shoot. Really. I'm serious, harp. It's important. And what do I owe the pleasure of you ruining my Saturday? My teenage daughter. My Saturday's fucked. I go by Cate's recital. She's a no show. All I want is for my daughter to be able to handle the things that come at her in life. Well, call me crazy, but what about talking to the ex? Where's the fucking gun? Oh, Nicky. I've tried to reach out a couple times to have a conversation, and she just goes nuclear. You're never going to resolve this if you guys can't even talk to each other, which, by the way, is all kids want. They want their parents to get along, or at least be able to talk. Look, Harper, I get it. I'm a crook. We made a deal, and a deal's a deal. Things have taken a turn for the worse. So what's different? What's different now is that her mom, she's checked into rehab, she's doing a stint, and Cate's a teenager. She's a 16 year old, Harper, with 16-year-old problems. She's got boobs and hormones. She's hanging out with a group of dopey kids making bad choices. She needs some guidance in life, but I wouldn't be good at that. I don't know how to teach her that stuff. It's a fucking problem. What I wanna know is how the hell did you convince your mom to let you stay here by yourself? Well, when your mom's packing for detox, you can pretty much get her to sign off on anything. Like, what do you do when you're all by yourself and you get bored? Since I don't have any family around, what I always do... Go to Becca's. Cheers to that. Seriously, no shit like that. Who cares? I won. I won, Jeremy. Let's go, Jeremy. Keys. All right, look. This is my baby. Is it your baby? Well, you should probably wash it more often. Come on, keys. Oh, you actually got the keys. Where are we going? Hey, harp. Alejandro is dead. What? He's dead. They're all dead. You got a problem. You've been framed, Nick. Meet me at your place in five minutes. What the fuck is going on here? My hands aren't in this thing. Alejandro's father is Victor Vasquez. He's the head of a major drug cartel in Mexico. There are cemeteries in business because of Victor Vasquez. Now, this guy is very dangerous, and we don't know what he thinks happened. This is a Christmas card he sends out when someone crosses him. Serves as a message to anyone who might do the same. He's not someone you want coming after you. Look, I'm the one that provides for Cate. If anything was to happen to me, worst-case scenario, I've got to make sure that she's taken care of. Oh, Nick. I think I got a move. I can do it quick. Then you go. You go and you go quick. What is it that you're looking for, Mr. Barrow? Something for the immediate future. All right, well then, I would suggest our term life policy. A premium on a $500,000 life insurance policy would be... Does that cover me? What's next? You have any felony convictions less than three years ago? Do you skydive? No. Are you a pilot? No. Do you drink? Smoke? Well, more than I should but not always enough. I assume that carries an overage premium? It does. Okay. What else? Well, I guess the name of your beneficiary. Cate... uh, Catherine. Catherine Jill Barrow. This is the name of her bank. Her account number, and I'd like to prepay any taxes. All right. Well, um... I will write up the policy, file it, and pending your blood work in about three weeks, you will get confirmation of your coverage. After that, you can jaywalk all you want. Charger. It's used. Tags. Gas. Plates are clean. Where is it? Alley behind Derian's. You be smart. Then lay low at the safe house till we can see how this plays out. Yeah. Mr. Barrow, do you know who this is? How did you get this number? I know people. We need to talk, Nick. Isn't that what we're doing now? In person. Impossible. I've been doing this a long time, and you know what I've learned? What? That anything is possible. Being interrogated by a cartel leader is not how I expected my day to start out. This is bad, really bad. All I could do was try my best to stay calm, keep my mouth shut, and not rat out Jimmy Lincoln. I've been around long enough to know, you start talking, you end up dead. Mr. Barrow. Nick. Can I call you Nick? Yeah. I'm going to ask you a few questions. We're just talking. And you answer them honestly... And we're fine. You go your way, I'll go mine. Hm? And because I understand this is an extremely awkward situation, I'm going to start with an easy one. Who else did you sell the job to? No one. You don't, uh... It doesn't go like that. I didn't find the job, I just planned it. Who found this one? Then that puts us at a bit of a crossroads, my friend. I know deep down... I know you know something. A name, an address, a number. Something. I don't know. I feel I can tell you that at some point I'm gonna end up losing my Patience. "Catherine." Wife? Victor, listen to me. Or daughter? Listen to me. I designed it, that's it. Daughter. We're making progress. So I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get your daughter. In the meantime... Make yourself at home. Good. I feel good about this. I'm gonna get some water. I'm just gonna... Easy, easy. Don't do it! Stand! Stay! Stop it! Victor found me. He thinks I double sold the job. Someone else put their hands in this. Where's Jimmy Lincoln? I don't know. I need you to find him for me. Cate's not safe. Where is she? I'm going to get her now. Cate, it's okay. Please, we gotta go. They're going to be here soon. Who's gonna be here soon? Guys that're trying to kill me. What the hell are you doing here? Okay, listen. We got to... Cate! Cate, please! We gotta get out of here. Cate... What, are you kidnapping me? I'm not kidnapping you. Parents kidnap kids all the time. I'm sorry. We gotta go quick. Let's go. No, fuck this. I'm not moving until you tell me what's going on. Cate, trust me. It's a long story, but if you want to live, you'll start listening. Trust you? I don't even know you. I'm not going anywhere. You don't have a choice. What's going on? This is where you live? No. It's kinda shitty. It's just a place to stay until i... You're a thief, right? That's what mom said. You steal stuff, right? Yeah. You must really suck at it. It's not, uh... I have another place. We just can't go there. Whatever. Don't. What? It can be traced. It's not good anymore. What... That... that's my fucking phone! Those are my friends. What are you doing? People follow us through those phones. How long am I gonna be here? I don't know. I'm hungry. Got anything for me to eat? No. Where are we going? That's still up in the air. Wow. You really planned this out, huh? Give me a little time. Things have changed. I'll figure it out, okay? Seventy-one degrees in downtown Atlanta, and the hits keep rolling here on WCYZ. How did you get these? Listen. Did you take these? Yes. This whole time! My whole entire life you've been watching me? What are you, some kind of pervert? What the hell kind of way is that to talk to your father? I don't have a father. You do have a father. Now, I want you to listen to me for a second here. I don't care. I want to go home. You can't. You're not safe. Look, at this age they're either angry at the world, or they're just plain hostile. Then I'm lucky, because she's both. I mean, how the hell do you do it? How do I do it? Unless my kids need money, they pretty much ignore me. You just, uh... You don't say anything to make her mad. Everything makes her mad. Well, then choose a safe topic. Like what? I don't know. Barbies, for Christ sakes. Jesus, they found me fast. Your phone was out there too long. Now... These should help. There's your three burners, your Sims. You switch them out every night, and I'll do the same. Where are we at with Jimmy Lincoln? Last known address. Thanks. Appreciate you sticking your neck out for me, harp. Her whole life I've been watching her, and now here she is, and... I don't think I can do it, harp. You have to. You don't have a choice, Nick. Your new phone. Text your mom so she has your number. Her silent treatment actually gave me some time to think. The plan was simple. Hide out and do our best to look like a normal family. How hard could that be? This'll be a good spot to hide out and lay low. This sucks. And when you wake up tomorrow, nothing about that will have changed. Of course, you won't have any bullet holes in you, so maybe it gets upgraded to mildly crappy. Fifty ninety-four. Fifty ninety-four. Hey, detective. You know him? Nope. My ex might. Got another one down in the alley. Give us five, fellas. Fuck. It isn't him. Hm? The only person we're supposed to find dead ain't here. Nick Barrow running means Victor Vasquez chasing. He's dead before morning. Get in the car. I'm not getting in the car, Nick. I don't want to get in the car. No matter how bad you think this thing has been, I promise you, it can get a hell of a lot worse. Don't worry, Nick, all right? You're off the hook. I'll get you a mug. You tried your best. I've taken care of myself my whole life. I can do it just fine now. I'm going home. That's not an option. Option? When was I given an option? What choices have I gotten to make, Nick? When do I get to pick what I want? Because I certainly haven't had any of that up until now. Goddamn it! Cate, this isn't safe! Now, I'm done playing around with you. Get your ass in this car right now. What's up? Mama. Welcome home, Oscar. You have a beautiful family. I know you work with the Atlanta police department. There is something I need from you. Do you have a moment to talk? Daddy, twirl me! You okay? Would you like to go swimming? In what? I don't have any stuff. What are we doing here? You said you wanted stuff. I thought we weren't supposed to be outside. It's not about being inside or outside. It's about being smart, not drawing attention to yourself, blending in. You check in a hotel and you never leave, it's suspicious. You stand on the side of the road screaming, and it looks like you're being abducted. That draws attention. Here you go. What do you want me to do with these? Swim. Oh, these aren't me. I'm out of my hello kitty phase. You missed it. Cate, you said you wanted to go swimming. Pick something or don't. It's up to you. Fine, I wanna swim. I'm Adam this is Ian and Ben. You here for the off-road bike thing? 'Cause I'm one of the drivers. Oh, no, no. I'm just hanging out. With? Nick. My dad. Kind of. Nick, who's kind of your dad? Sounds kind of weird. Yeah, it is kind of weird. Is that your dad's charger? God, I'd love to drive that thing. You want a beer? Yeah. Yeah, sure. No more beer. What? Drinking a beer is the safest thing I've done with you yet. You're 16. No more. Okay? Shit, it's my mom. Don't mention anything about, uh... Anything. Hey. Hey. I tried calling your old number, but no one answered. Then you texted me this new number. Yeah, it was... It was time for a new phone. Have you been drinking? Drinking heavily was something new for Lucy. She recently lost her mother, and it hit her pretty hard. I tried to reach out, but she wouldn't have it. I just hope she could get on the other side of things. One minute, one hour, one day at a time. It's a choice, mom. I hope you're right. Okay, you can do this. Just go to bed. Okay. I love you. I love you, too, mom. How much trouble are you in? A lot more than I want to be in. Someone was murdered and they think I did it. Did you? No. Huh. Then who did? That's why we're here. Yeah. No. It's only called a fistula if it... if it opens up to the outside of your body. Hang on a second. I gotta call you back, Jake. What's going on? Okay, you know, I don't like people in my space. Okay? And I can't find my cat. Have you seen patches? Did you see a calico run out the door when you opened the door? C-could we do... I-I'm happy to have you here. But could we... could we do this in the hallway? We can talk in the hallway. All right, just don't... Please, don't touch anything. Who's the... what... Who's the girl? Never you mind. His daughter. His daughter? You didn't tell me you had a daughter. What's your name, sweetheart? Fuck off. I need to know everything you do about how this trick came to you, Jimmy. There's nothing to tell. I mean, I just... You know, even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while, right? Try again. I got a guy at the courthouse. Okay? He calls me up. He says there's some cash laying around, easy grab. I call you. Beginning, middle, end. Just like always. You know goddamn well that someone killed my buyers. Hey... I don't know shit. And I have everybody looking at me. I don't know anything about this. Now I'm looking at you. Okay, what do you want from me? You don't know anything? No, I don't know anything about this. I don't wanna know. I stay here. You're making me nervous, Jimmy. I don't like you coming here. That's why we use a phone. Don't tell me you don't fucking know the buyers. I don't know anything. What do you want me to do? I wanna fucking meet 'em! You want me to call them? I wanna meet 'em! It's a guy at the courthouse. I wanna meet your fucking contact. Okay, fine... The guy who gave you the fucking job! Fine, fine. I wanna meet him now, and I wanna meet him today. Okay. Okay. Not a problem. Yeah. You okay? Jimmy Lincoln. Great. Thanks. What do they call those, skinny jeans? How old are you, little darling? Sixteen, douchebag. You know, age of consent is 16 in Georgia. I mean, not for me, I'm just saying. They're active at this age. And when they use language like that, you really have to question some of the parenting choices made. All right, see the parking garage up there? That's where we want to go. Just pull right in. Nick! Oh, my god! Oh, god. Let's go. WIXP news. Top of the hour. Still not much movement being reported in the Fulton county armored car heist. The money taken from the evidence locker is yet to be recovered, and no suspects have been named. Hey, kid. You land somewhere? Listen to me, harp. I killed a fucking cop. A detective. The guy was waiting to kill me. Jesus Christ. You get a name? Detective Dinardi. Well, let me see what I can dig up on him. What the hell am I in the middle of here? I don't know, but it's all over the TV. The local news was reporting that the money from the heist was crucial evidence in a case to indict a crew of unnamed dirty cops. But since Alejandro conveniently stole it, the da now has no case and is forced to drop the charges against the officers. ...reporting live from the Fulton county courthouse. All I can do now is wait for Harper to dig something up. Listen, do I have cops looking for me now, too? I'll work on this. Be smart. Stay low. No, no. No. Marco... Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hey, the bathroom's a mess. No, it's not. Yeah, the bathroom's a mess. Can you clean it up? That is clean. Well, you gotta at least do something with the bras. What, you've never seen a bra before? This is different. Different how? Different in that they're yours. Oh, you're embarrassed. I'm not embarrassed. You know I'm not a virgin. Oh, Cate, seriously? Can I just take a shower? I did it in mom's bed. I was totally fine with it. I mean, it was... Eric Griffin? What? The guy, Eric Griffin? You didn't sleep with him, Cate. You were lonely, and you were pissed, and I don't blame you. But you didn't sleep with him. How do you... You didn't talk... Did you talk to him? Did you talk to him? I liked him. Well, you could've done better. What? You could've done better, Cate. The guy was an asshole. You sold yourself short, and you shouldn't, ever. Oh, so now you're giving life advice? You're a thief. Can we just work on the bathroom right now? No. No, no. Let's go. Let's go. Let's hear it. Enlighten me. Okay. Blackjack. If you can get the house to agree to stand on a soft 17, you can whittle their odds down by .21 percent. What? You should know how to change a car tire. Wouldn't hurt you to learn the infield fly rule. And don't ever wear suede. Who intercepted the call? I did. It was our girl in dispatch. We're good. I'm telling you, I.A.'S looking over my shoulder. And guys in our crew disappearing ain't helping. This guy's gotta be dealt with, cap. The longer he runs, the more dots he connects. The da can't prosecute without evidence. And thanks to Alejandro Vasquez stealing it, they no longer have any. No one can connect us to any of this. Nick Barrow can. Understand this: Each one of you made a decision to be standing here the day you decided to reach under the table and take the money. He's fighting. And you don't fight this hard unless you have a good goddamn reason. Find it! And get rid of the bodies. Fuck, man. I knew it. Just fucking relax. Oh. You eat like shit. Coffee? At your age, you should be taking a vitamin. Coffee is my vitamin. Well, caffeine's not good for you. Guys trying to kill you isn't good for you. Caffeine is fine. What else you got? No, no. Look. Here. Well, we're on the run, right? Okay, Cate. A wig, an outfit... It's only gonna attract attention that we don't want. You want to go somewhere? Try and dress like the people that are gonna be there. You go to a brave's game, you wear a brave's Jersey. You go to a tractor pull, wear flannels and jeans. Try not to look anybody in the eye. If everyone turns to look at something, you turn and you look at the same thing. Everyone's moving, you keep moving. Make it like you're on your way somewhere... That you know where you're going. You don't do anything to draw attention to yourself. We just have to keep low and remember the rule of two. "Rule of two"? It takes a person two encounters to recognize a stranger. The first time, you're just a face. The second time, something sticks. They may not know why, but something lingers. And then, you're somewhere you don't want to be. Which is where? In their head. Huh. What do you got? You ain't gonna like it. Then lie to me. Well, stock market's up, you won the lottery, and there's a model here asking for your number. Runway or like, sports illustrated? Hand. Ah. The cop you killed... dinardi... was running with a pretty nasty crew. Their co, Joe Keenan, a 20-year vet... He's been there, and he's done that twice over, and none of it's too good. Turns out Keenan wasn't always bad. He worked undercover so long, he became the very thing he was trying to fight. And once your hands are dirty, it's hard to ever get them clean. Even though this crew's been under a lot of suspicion, everyone's innocent until proven guilty, especially cops. And with the evidence against them gone, internal affairs has as little proof as I do that Keenan framed me. But I know one thing: Guys like this get used to things going their way. And I'm sure they didn't count on me staying alive. The longer they can't find me, the more they'll start to unravel. Did my name hit the wire? No. They're trying to keep it quiet, take care of it themselves. I'm thinking about getting out of here. Maybe making a run up north over the border. No, you stay put. Vasquez would expect you to make a dash. He'll have guys looking for you everywhere. You're good there. You stay there. All right. Let me ask you this. What kind of stuff do you steal? Anything that's worth it. You ever been caught? Well, I don't actually steal the stuff. I just plan the heist, and then I sell it to whoever wants to take the risk. How much do you sell them for? Depends on the trick. Are you rich? Well, most of the tricks I peddle don't pan out. I got two bookies on speed dial and a semi-professional gambling problem. So why do it? Only thing I'm good at. So, how do you figure out how to steal the stuff you steal? How do you write a song? Show me. You want me to tell you how to knock off the bakery? Yeah. Why not? Number one: You have to know how to get out before you get in. That's most important. And number two? You look, you wait, you think. Security comes first. Does the building have CCTV's, alarm? If the alarm is tripped, who's responding? Private security? Local police? Or is the owner getting a courtesy call and has to motivate himself to get out of bed? Just for a bakery? A bakery, a bank, business. A job's a job. Now, there's six stores. The sight lines are the front of our target. Up there, there's what? Three apartments? They vacant? They occupied? Then there's the exit plan. Are you walking out or you driving out? Driving. You need a driver. Can you trust him? Or her? Is he any good? Will he show up? Okay, I'll walk. Which way you walking? I don't know. That way? The bank? What about it? There's an ATM. Means it has a camera. Okay, I'll go the other way. The b&b? 'Cause there's people coming and going at off hours. A young girl carrying a few dozen bear claws is gonna draw some interest. Matty, you have to pull yourself together. I can't. I cannot do the rest of my tour with I.A. Looking over my shoulder. Matty, suspicion and conviction live on opposite sides of town. This is what we do. It got messy. We cleaned it up. I just... I just want out. There's no out. This is the ride. We've got a year, maybe two, till we hand in our stars. Our pension's in sight. And it has never been this hot, ever. We take money from scumbags and lowlifes. Anyone we shake down has it coming. I just... I just want out. Happy birthday. My birthday's in August. I missed a few. I... I can't... what... What is this? It's a pony. What do you think it is? Thanks. Come on. We're going out. Really? Where? Surprise. Oh, yeah! Yeah! Go like this with your hands. Make a square. Look at my middle finger. Right here, the one I'm holding up. Yeah? Now pull it back towards your eyes. Don't even think about it. Go! That means you're left-eye dominant. That means you close your right eye when you shoot. There's a couple universal rules when you're handling a weapon. Number one is, you don't point the weapon at anything unless you're prepared to shoot. Wanna hold your... Keep your thumbs relaxed. You want to put it right over the front sighting. Then, when you pull the trigger, just the same steady pressure. Go. Bingo. I told you. Are you calling me a liar? Your very own... I hit the balloon. ...little pink, uh... He just wants a toy that I hit! Mommy, it's okay. Just zip it, okay? Look, you just can't let people walk all... You know, this is bullshit. Look, lady, it's called pop the balloon. You want something... Stay here. ...then pop the fucking balloon. Don't fuck... Don't curse in front of my child. Look at that. Magic. Here you go. Whoa. What is this? Are you charity night at the fair? I'm just trying to help. Help? Help with what? I don't need you... You know what? My kid, my business, okay? Jenny... Is everything okay? No. This a-hole is trying to steal my cash, and this one is sticking his face where it doesn't belong. I think I have it from here, sir. Appreciate it. Here you go. Thank you. Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! When all of this is over, I want to leave and go on a trip with you. Where would we go? I don't know. Your beach. From the photos. What about your mom? You still like her. Cate... How did you guys meet? Your mom? She was, uh, young, and she was with a dance company. And, uh, she was pretty opinionated. Gave me, uh... gave me a hard time most of the time. I don't know. She made me laugh, I guess. Well, then you came along. We should take a picture while we're still at the top. Okay. That's a good idea. All right. You ready? Yep. Ready? One, two, three. Hello, Matty. Jesus! Christ, cap. What are you doing with I.A.? What are you talking about? I didn't speak to them. I got pictures. You're as dirty as me, pal. Question is, what the hell could you have that they want? You've been thinking about making a deal, haven't you, Matty? I didn't say nothing. They wanted to talk. I didn't... Fu... fuck you! I got him here, just like you said. I did good, right? That you did. This is detective Keenan. Shots fired, officer down. Repeat: Shots fired, officer down. Signal 50 and 48. Send the fucking e.M.S now! Where you at, detective? Blue bird motel, Glenwood and Avery. Oh, geez! Hurry! Roger. Signal 50 and 48. E.M.S on the way. Can you identify the suspect? Nick Barrow. You're gonna get us out of this, right? Yeah. I am. He killed a cop! Are you sure? I'm holding the fucking APB in my hand. I... I don't know that there's anything else I can do for you now. There's nothing else you can do, Oscar? You better hope that's not the case, my friend. Chief? Chief, let's go! Mm... Rise and shine. Time to fight bad guys. Morning. Mm-hmm. How can you say that? The sex pistols were a great band. No, they were a great bad band. Cate, something's happened. What? Pack your stuff now. Why? Because they found us. Wait. I thought you said no one knew where we were. Cate, I'm serious. - Come on. Grab your bag. - We gotta go. Nick. Nick. It's okay, Cate. I got a plan. I need you to do exactly what I say. We need something to separate the sheriff and the deputy. Then we can meet at the rendezvous point in ten minutes. - Put your hands up. - Don't move! If something goes wrong, no matter what happens, get out of town and do not come back. This is non-negotiable. Get out the way! Coming through! Freeze! Come on, Cate. Out! Out of the car right now! Get down. Don't move! Oh, I got your ass now. Try and run again. Put your hands up and get on your knees. Lay down! "Nicholas Barrow, wanted for the murder of detective Matthew Miller." Is this you? Do you believe everything you read? Yeah, when it has the words "apb" on top of it, I do. Some people got killed, and the person who put me on that APB thinks that I did it. And that's your story, and you're sticking to that, huh? Hey, sheriff, will you listen to me? The guy that I'm running from has connections everywhere. That APB isn't real. He's using you to track me down. Don't make that call! Please don't make that call! I want you to sit down! A man lives his life, and everything he was fits into a goddamn box. He say anything? What? Matty. Did he say anything before he passed? He was pretty far gone. First Dinardi, now Matty. You saw him, right? I mean Barrow. You... you saw him? Yeah, I saw him. What about it? What went down? Why not put two in his head right then and there? What do you want from me, Darrell, huh? You want to hear me say I fucked up? Fine, I fucked up! All right? You happy? He got the jump on me. Barrow got the jump on me. I had to make a decision. Hey, cap. We got him. Call just came in from a sheriff on the APB you put out. All right. Let's do this. Boss, they're here. I'm detective Garcia, the two-four. I'm looking for sheriff Braydon. - Right here. - Sheriff, you have to listen to me. These guys aren't cops. Look like cops to me. Sheriff, will you listen to me? He been like this the whole time? Sheriff, these guys aren't... We good to go? Yeah, as soon as we verify your badge numbers. Call them in, Dean. You got it. Zone nine. P.A. Uh, sheriff Braydon's office up in Hastings. We're looking to confirm two badge numbers relating to a transfer. Sure. Hold on. All right. First one. Thank you. Sheriff! Sheriff, these guys aren't cops! Sheriff, please. Nick... I no longer care about you, Nick. You are dead. I'm gonna send you to your grave, and then I'm going to do the same thing to your daughter. Hey. Uh, that was weird. What was weird? I just got a call from a.P.D. C.I. A detective named Keenan. He's 15 minutes out to pick up his prisoner. What prisoner? Barrow. Keenan's freaking out. He's never heard of anyone named detective Garcia, and... Son of a bitch! Don't call anyone! Get Dean! How did you get me on the APB? Are you sick enough to kill a cop just to set me up? I didn't kill any cop. Then how did you... Shit! Dean! Dean! Fuck! Where the fuck you at? Dean! Shut your ass up! You know how to use that thing? You want to find out? Put your hands up. Give me the keys. Get down! Put your gun on him. Now it's my turn to talk. I didn't kill Alejandro, Victor. I think the guy behind this name is Keenan, and he's a cop. How do I know you weren't in on it? I've got nothing to hide. That's why I'm not gonna kill you. You're not gonna kill me because if you do... This will never end. I'm gonna prove to you that I had nothing to do with it. And then I'm gonna ask for something in return. Your word as a father that when you hear the truth, that you leave Cate alone. I didn't kill Alejandro, Victor. Go. Get down. Get down. Come on. I told you this was non-negotiable. I just saved your life. Okay? A thank you would be nice. Well, don't do it again. I was trying to help you! I don't need your help! Oh, you could have fooled me. I can't do this if I know you're in danger. And as long as you're with me... You're starting to become... What? I'm starting to become what? Too involved. I want to be involved! What if you got hurt? Everything I would have done would have meant nothing. Everything you've done? Everything I've done has been for you. The running! The hiding! All of it has been for you! Damn it, Nick! I just want to help you. I don't need your help. Cate. Open the... Cate! Cate! Run a print on this. Prints match the ones that was taken off the keychain. She got busted with a couple of friends. What did I tell you? Who was arrested with her? Who bailed her out? I want all the information. All of it! You got it, cap. Becca, I'm at your place, you need to call me. This day could not end soon enough. I couldn't find Cate and my window was closing with Victor. Matty's death just wasn't sitting right with me. Would Keenan really be desperate enough to kill his own men? And if so, why? I had Harper do some digging into Matty's personal files. Turns out the guy was going through a nasty divorce. But Miller was crafty. He started a dummy corporation which had only one hidden asset. A boat. Sounds like a good place to start. - Cate! - Not quite. Keenan. Very good, Nick. Let me talk to my daughter. Nick, I want you to listen to me very carefully. I'm gonna give you an address, and I don't give a shit if you're in Timbuktu. You've got 15 minutes to get there. Now you listen to me, you fuck. If you harm her in any way I promise, I'll... Nick, I need you to focus, okay? Otherwise you're not gonna make it in time. I have your money. What money? The money Matty Miller took. I got it. Mechanicsville, south side of the old Brickworks. Come alone. No tricks. Send her over, Keenan. And the money? Somewhere close. And that's where it stays until I have my daughter. Then you've made a critical error in judgment. Just like Matty Miller? What the fuck is he talking about? He's talking shit. Only thing that makes sense, Keenan. Internal affairs, right? Is that why you killed him? He turned on you? You killed Matty? He was gonna give the money over to I.A. He had you dead to rights. He had all of you. You motherfucker! How does he know about all this shit, cap? Doesn't matter! If there's money floating around, it's gonna take us down! You gonna kill everybody, Keenan? What the hell else you ain't telling us, cap? Nothing. I thought you said we were all in the fucking clear, huh? Mosley! Ah! Fuck! Fuck you, Keenan! This way. It's over now, right? Almost. Soon. You saved me. Yeah. Well then, we're even. Now this could be tricky. And a lot more dangerous. We got the context. Keenan, Victor, everyone we need. All right, here's the plan. We gotta spread a little rumor... Wait a minute. I have an idea. No. You do not have any idea, okay? You are not getting involved in this. Nick, you just said it yourself... I am not getting in this with you right now. We don't have a choice. No way, Cate. No way. Now the next part of this can get a little more difficult. We get through this and the heat is off. Then you're done with this. Clean slate. It's not about going inside or outside. It's about being smart, not drawing attention to yourself, blending in. You look. You wait. You think. The sight lines are the front of our target. Then there's the exit plan. Are you walking out or you driving out? Don't point the weapon at anything unless you're prepared to shoot. Detective Keenan! You gonna kill me? You know the best advice my father ever gave me, detective? Don't sell myself short. Ever. Killing's the easy part. Getting away with it. That's the trick. You have two neighbors. One is away for another two weeks. The other couple is home. The lady's at least 75. Her husband's older. It's now 10:20. She's been asleep for two hours. He's parked in front of the TV watching the braves, hearing aid out. And then, of course, there's this. You're a drinker. Now, it might take a lot, and you might hide it well, but I know. How many times have you come out here and waved your gun around? Or yelled at some kids for hitting a ball into your yard? I think I can get away with it. You just made a pretty good case of why I could kill you, too. Answer this. Why my dad? Your dad fills a lot of holes, sweetheart. Gave Victor Vasquez someone to blame for his son's murder so he could move on with his life. You know, there was only one thing that could put me in jail, and you saved me the trouble of having to go look for it by bringing it right to me and putting it in my refrigerator. Go home, kid. What was it you said, detective? I need to move on with my life? Hm? Well, guess what? I'm not ready. What are you gonna do to him? Nothing good. "D.A. Recovered stolen evidence money. Detective Keenan's still missing, wanted for multiple murders within the Atlanta pd. In light of these developments, original suspect Nick Barrow has been exonerated of all charges." Looks like I won't be collecting that insurance money. No. I think you got a better payout. You're right. Appreciate it, harp. Get out of here, kid. Well, it looks like my plan worked out pretty well. Yeah. I was closer than you think. Old habits die hard. Lucy and I finally spoke, and were able to agree on one thing. Going forward, it would be best for her to focus on getting better. If she needed anything, we'd be there for her. Lucy also thought that the best thing for Cate was to live with me. I agreed. I guess maybe I was more ready to be a dad than I realized. Do you think... That when we're back in town I'll be seeing a lot of you? Will you be seeing a lot of me? Well, let's see. I do live in an apartment by myself. I was thinking about getting a fish. Yeah, you'll be seeing a lot of me. Okay, good, because there's this place I do my recitals. And they're closed every Sunday. What are you talking about? Most people pay cash so the cash register's gotta be completely full, and I already have a good out. Okay, the place next to it? Went out of business. They're completely vacant. No one's in the area. I could get in and out of there so quickly. Okay, let's just take it one step at a time here, please. Focus on graduating high school. I'm just saying. Uh-huh. I have something for you. What is it? Well, I... I know you have a bunch of just me. I thought maybe you'd like one with both of us. I love it.
