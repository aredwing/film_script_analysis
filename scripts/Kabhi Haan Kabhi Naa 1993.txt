Married, did you say? It's nothing... nothing at all. What's the time anyway? 8 o'clock. If I'm late today too... ...Imran'll give me hell... And I must be at the station by 12 as well! My goodness! So many pictures of Anna. She's in English literature. In Economics... In Psychology too! I've only one favorite subject... Anna... Anna... and Anna! She doesn't love you though. But she likes me, doesn't she? She'll love me too. Exactly at five past 12! Oh, that's why you're going to the station! She's coming. Yes, after a whole year! I want that when she gets off... it's my face that she sees first How happy she'll be to see me! Wear this jacket. In this, you look very... - Sunil, Nikki! - Coming. Just a minute. Here, give it to me, Mummy. Why trouble yourself Nikki said you had to go to the Bank. Have you any errands? I'm here to run them for you - No errands. - Nothing? Oh yes! You have to go to the market then. For rations. I don't have to go to the Bank, or get rations or need oil! You've got this week's pocket money. So don't butter me up! Call your father, Nikki. Breakfast's getting cold That's what I like about Mummy... No Nonsense. Papa, breakfast is ready. Coming. I'll just wash my hands. I told you once. Not a paisa'll you get! Mom, please. Just 30 bucks. Ok then, make it 20. Sunil, my beloved son, you want money, do you? You can ask me, your Dad, can't you? I'll give however much you want, my son. Considering you're such a good son... and how proud I'm of you for failing not once or even twice but THRICE! In all subjects on one occasion! How can you work in your Dad's garage! Won't the grease dirty your hands? No, my son. You were born to do such great deeds! You're so kind as to give me the chance to be your father. Now you do what you want, stay out all day and even the night too! Go and play in a stupid band with your useless friends and play this rotten stupid horn! - It's a trumpet, not a horn. - Whatever! It's not a stupid band. We play very good music. As for your garage, I'll never work there. So you'll play a damn horn all your life? How will you eat? Let me pass and I'll find some job. Let him pass! Heard that, Prabha? As if we are stopping him from passing! And if you fail? Fail? The question doesn't arise! It has! 3 years in a row! But I'll pass this year. No matter what. If you don't, it's the garage. Understand? - I do. - What did you understand? I fail and that's the end of music and the garage begins. - I'm off. - Your breakfast... Can't you even stop to wish me a good day properly!? I'm in a hurry. Hurry or not, you surely mustn't forget your manners. - Well, drop me off at the church. - But it's the other way! Whether you go one way or the other... ...all paths lead to God. I must go for the rehearsal, Father. Slow... slow down, my son I do know heaven is beautiful... but I'm in no hurry to go there Easy now. Why do you go so fast? I've been late 3 days running and Imran will eat me alive! What's the excuse today? Believe me, it's no excuse. I ran into Father Braganza He asked me drop him to the Church. What could I do? - The same excuse as yesterday. - But I lied yesterday! Believe me, I really met him! How can I? You've to go to the bank or get rations And even queue up for oil! If nothing else, it's Father Braganza! Let it be, Imran. At least he has a new excuse every day Shut up, yezdi! My brother spoke to Patel and he has agreed Forgive me, Imran. Forgive me, yaar Hey Imran, who's this Patel? Manager of Chinatown. Wants a good band for the club It's our first chance to turn professional. Mustn't blow it. Smita's getting married. Who'll sing in her place? That can wait, yezdi... well, what are our chances, Tony? It's done. Patel is a good pal of my brother Richie He'll take us to Chinatown this evening to meet Patel Today? - An audition and it's ours! A terrific new song to make Patel happy! Don't you worry, yaar ok, Sunil. Get started. Tony, your guitar... Think of the lyrics, the tune Make it quick, tho'. I must go Go where? Anna is coming today. - Anna? Quiet, yaar. No body must know this you said you'd go to the interview with me Damn your interview! You'll never get a job, so why go! What to do! My Dad almost canes me into going! Sunil, stop yakking and get to work. Be serious, yaar yes, Imran. I was thinking... the tune must be romantic... And emphasize the melody... Isn't that so Correct! Melody means sweetness... ...which'll enter the heart thro' the ears... Think of the words for a romantic tune what'll be the tune... And what'll be its theme? I got it! I got the theme for the song! The theme is... A lover is waiting impatiently... ...for his beloved to return... on a railway platform! And I know who the girl is... Anna! Super! Sunil, go on. Tell us, yaar The lover is young and very handsome The train goes thro' the jungle... The girl's looking out of the window The trees rustle and sway There's a monkey on a tree... Quiet, you monkey! Birds flying in the sky... yes. I can see them too! A tunnel thro' the mountains And an engine hooting again and again... "Crazy... This heart is crazy" "This heart's crazy for you" "How long have I waited for you" "when will you come, o love of my life" "How long have I waited for you" "when will you come, o love of my life" "The more I try and quieten..." "...the more excited is this my heart" "Crazy... This heart is crazy" "This heart's crazy for you" The train's got stuck. How I wish Chris was here! But he's in Bangalore Good you're back know why we're writing it? - Why? For Patel. - Oh, Chinatown! The song's stuck now. - Why? Help us with the song. Let's start again Be quick, ok? I must go. - Why? Because Anna's coming. - Anna? That's great, yaar! That's why I got back quickly from Bangalore She'll be back in the band. - This is really good Damn! He is going too! I thought I'd be going alone to receive Anna Chris, tell Anna we'll meet her at the bakery today Let's start you look very happy, yaar. - Of course. Anna's coming But you needn't receive her. - Why? Her brother Albert'll fetch her. He said so of course. But I shall go. I've waited for this moment you needn't check the watch. Do trains ever come on time! They're always late... 2 or 4 or even 6 hours late yesterday it was 12 hours late! 12 HoURS! If it were me, I'd never go. But I will go... however late it may be! Come here, Chris Help finish the song. - You've to go, as it is Imran, I too must go early. Going to the station? - What'll I do there! An errand for my Dad and you know him...

It's enough you at least thought of me And anyway, it's feeling that counts Gifts don't matter much How's it possible I wouldn't bring anything for you? Sunil plays the mouth organ so well It's nothing. Just put it to your lips and blow! No, Albert.

Why isn't he here? Poor guy's badly stuck at work.

She must be waiting for an ice-cream too! Anna! Er... The fact is... It's good you know it, Chris. Or you'd misunderstand me whatever I did was for your own good Anna's very dangerous.

Sunil changed it to 7 A lie! - Your fault But why!? Ask him. He did it deliberately what's all this hassle? - Tell us! No hassle. I'll tell you Remember, you were leaving the bakery this morning? You ran into me there. I was on my bike you insisted I go to the restaurant with you? Yes There you said you were meeting Anna at 7 you're lying! I said 6 you said 7. Try and remember. - Have some shame! Lies and more lies! How many lies, Sunil? Please, wait! I swear I told him 6 o' clock, Anna! Sunil, tell me the truth. What's the matter? All right, Anna. Perhaps I heard it wrong as 7, not 6 But if the time w AS 6... Ask him why he gave me the message for you... ...to meet him at 7? What message? You forgot the message in this 6 & 7 muddle! A lie! I sent no message But why'd I lie, Anna? If I did, why'd I make it 7? I could've said 9 or 10! Or even Monday or Tuesday I could even say Chris wasn't coming at all Can't tell who's lying... - I'm telling the truth! Sunil, if you lie, I'II... - Stop it now! You cut him off ruthlessly you promised you wouldn't say anything I don't remember anything you should hear what else he said about you Anna. He said that you play games of love with guys And that you make false promises with them and that your the biggest flirt. What? You said that I'm a flirt? Yes Anna and he said that you like playing with guy's feelings. He said that you lead guys on and then when they get serious you let them loose. You said all this about me? Yes! He also said it was you who ruined Rahul Chowdhury He took to drugs and went mad because of you... And went to Canada for treatment And what I'll tell you next will stun you! He told me you led him on too! And tried to trap him! Am I like that, Sunil? - No! Absolutely not! Perhaps... I was wrong. But this isn't what I meant... I respect you so much... I love you so much... Please speak to me... Let me tell you why I did it Don't touch me! Don't ever come before me! Don't talk to me. I don't ever want to see your face! Anna! At least have this ice-cream... Please what have you done, Sunil! Dug your own grave! How'll you get out of this mess... But you've to get out you've only one goal... Anna Sunil! You! I must tell you something. It's very important I want to tell you that... How dare you come here! Anna, listen to me for a minute what's the matter, Sunil? - I must talk to you, Father I haven't the time to talk now But it's very important! Just 5 minutes No, Sunil. Later. Not now I'm in such trouble you're always in trouble. What's it now? You said such things about Anna? And you claim you said it out of love! What kind of love is this, Sunil! You call a poor innocent girl a flirt! A girl who lays snares... Strings boys along and then cuts them off! But I didn't REALLy say it! I didn't mean it How could you? Even yoU must've some limits Drove Rahul Chowdhry mad... Sent him off to Canada! But he did go to Canada But he didn't go mad before going there! I'd have slapped you if I were Anna! She did slap me She slapped you, did she! Good! You must go and ask her forgiveness I did go... thro' the window after climbing the balcony The window! Oh, Sunil! Why do you always use windows!? Why not try using the door first? I love Anna so much, Father The more I try and get close to her... ...the farther she is! She's so angry that I don't know how to placate her now what can I do to make her forgive me Father, you must show me a way out... Please... you must have something in you that can win Anna's heart But I have nothing, Father! There must be something. Think, Sunil yes, you've music! You play so well God has given you such a great gift. Use it we're to perform at the Chinatown Club I'll write such a song... all will be happy He's taking extra pictures of our group Come up quick. Must take your pictures Against the band's name Forget it, Imran. Don't be so hard-hearted Poor Sunil will feel so sad. - Let him This poor guy of yours has made Anna cry so much Remember that once we've decided to throw Sunil out of the band... ...it's final Please relent, Anna. What's done is done Forget it and call Sunil back All right, call him But I'll leave if he comes Take the photos one minute, Anna... Come and stand beside Chris... yes Now click our star pair together ok, brothers, I'm off. Practice hard, will you Take Chinatown by storm tonight! Some people are so dense that they can't take hints Hints! It's all written out there. Can't read or what! There's no lack of shameless people. We must ignore them And concentrate on our work May I sit here? I heard that your music is very good Thank you very much, sir But not here. Over there... But you will keep quiet Don't even think of sneaking into the band again I'm singing your lines now, understand? I understand. Very well too. - Good... Let's start Just a minute! - I told you to keep quiet! I just wanted to say this song won't do for Chinatown It'll be a total flop, actually A flop, you say! Heard that? When it was such a hit at Richie's wedding! They were crazy about it! What's more, Chris and Anna made a super hit pair People loved them I know folks loved it and the song was a super hit But that was a suit'n tie crowd And Chinatown is an entirely different world you sing a suit'n tie song to that crowd... And what'll happen? Thought of it? What he says is true Dad hasn't insured my life, you know! Well, if this won't do, which other song will? I'll tell you. The song must somehow reflect... ...the life of those who come to Chinatown It must say something about their situation... ...which they can recognize Something they can identify with... Rubbish! I don't agree And anyway, who'll write such a song? Yes! Who'll write it? I wrote such a song wonderful! You've already written it! You're a genius It's a trick. First, take the song then the singer we don't want it. - Absolutely! Why're you wasting time? - They're outdated songs Please listen to the song! Why listen to a song that we don't want! This isn't a trick, Anna keep me out of the band but at least take my song! We said we don't want to hear it! Ok, don't hear the song. At least read it once! Now you understand? - Ok... To hell with you all! Go sing your rotten old song! Don't come to me when they throw their shoes at you! Sorry for what happened, yaar I'll leave the band if you wish If you're out, I'm out too. - No need for that Don't you worry. I'll take care of them An idea... we're going to the Carnival after the rehearsal Try and persuade Anna there once Anna agrees, everybody else will... All right? "Anna, don't think my love is false, o my darling" "Anna, don't think my love is false, o my darling" "To win you, my love, was this whole charade" "Anna, don't think my love is false, o my darling" "To win you, my love, was this whole charade" "what's done is done. Won't you let it go at that" "what's done is done. Won't you let it go at that" "Look at my fate! An arrow's struck in my heart" "whose image is it that haunts me, o my love" "Let go my hand!

Won't you let it go at that" "what's done is done. Won't you let it go at that" "The snare you set caught you instead" "So Mister Trouble, get back the way you came" "Don't, o my friend, kick my bruised heart so!" "For God's sake know that I love you so!" "Now that I know don't dare talk anymore" "Anna, don't think my love is false, o my darling" "Anna, don't think my love is false, o my darling" "To win you, my love, was this whole charade" "what's done is done. Won't you let it go at that" "what's done is done. Won't you let it go at that" Anna, listen to what I've to say Go then, Anna. But give me back my trumpet! Brothers, today I present a brand new band before you It's a band that's the best. Lively, strong... And a hit! Hey Patel, stop yakking Bring on the musicians and let's test their playing! Yes.

Friends, it's most happy day for me I want to tell you all something In fact, I was very angry with Sunil for failing thrice I gave up all hope, all expectations I was most irritated by his music He'd play his horn all day and night too! How many sleepless nights! What I mean to say is... My wife... and so many of you perhaps... ...thought that Sunil was totally useless... ...he'd never amount to much in life And as for me, I was absolutely sure... ...that he'd fail this year too! But today... ...I've got everything in life! I don't want anything more. Never again'll I say to him... Son, come and work in my garage! No, son. Do whatever you want Make music your career if you wish yes. My blessings are with you May God... ...give you happiness and success And my son... here's a gift from all of us you see what this mark sheet has done? I just don't know what to do... It's so suffocating I'm feeling bad too I didn't know it'd go this far Don't be afraid. I'll go speak to your parents No! Don't do it! Don't know how they'll react But they must be told somehow... you had a false mark sheet made! Why on earth did you do it, Sunil your family is so happy that you passed... And threw such a nice party for you Have you thought of their state if they know this!? I've done something very wrong... Please forgive me Please tell them, I feel so wretched No, I won't tell them you did it and you must tell them the truth I can't! How can I! You told the lie, so you must tell the truth too Go, Sunil, Go now, this very instant! It was a false mark sheet! You failed! Aren't you ashamed! Why're you silent, you wretch! Come on, tell me! Go drown yourself in some dirty gutter! You cheat! Liar! Dirty wretch! You lied to me! You lied to everyone! Get lost! Go away from here! Now! Don't show me your face! Don't step into this house! You're dead to me! See what our son has done Friends, I want to tell you something All that I said about Sunil just a while ago... ...is all wrong That he made us happy... and we were proud of him... That our blessing're with him... all that is wrong All of you came here to celebrate with us... ...because Sunil passed with a first class It's false... everything's false He made a fool of us... cheated and lied! Let alone a first class he didn't even pass! He failed... yes, failed! The mark sheet he gave his father was a fake! What he did has made us hang our heads in shame! I'm ashamed that he is my son! Vinayak, I've known Sunil for so long I know what's good and what's bad in him Don't judge him by standards of passing and failing Look, there're some people in the world who want... ...to live life their own way. It's no use forcing them Such souls aren't worried about finding goals in life Life's journey is everything to them This is the greatest thing about Sunil To live such a life needs great courage And it is Sunil's courage... ...that made him own up his wrong doing before everyone To confess your wrong doing before so many... ...is no small thing! It shows how pure of heart Sunil is! Sunil hasn't failed... He has passed with cent percent marks! You should be proud to have a son like him, vinayak! If you feel what I said is right... Say that you've forgiven Sunil. Say it, vinayak Listen, vinayak... you have to say you have forgiven Sunil Say that you have forgiven Sunil! Say it, vinayak "A blithe spirit is he" "one in thousands is he" "A blithe spirit is he" "one in thousands is he" "All you ever saw were only his flaws" "But his talents you never saw" "A blithe spirit is he" "one in thousands is he" "All you ever saw were only his flaws" "But his talents you never saw" "A blithe spirit is he" "So lost in your own world are you" "How would you ever know what's in his heart" "So lost in your own world are you" "How would you ever know what's in his heart" "what I thought was stone" "Has turned into a diamond" "All you ever saw were only his flaws" "But his talents you never saw" "A blithe spirit is he" "one in thousands is he" "A blithe spirit is he" "The flute was for you only a lifeless stick" "Did you ever hear the melody of its song?" "The flute was for you only a lifeless stick" "Did you ever hear the melody of its song?" "All you ever saw was the lamp's lowly mud" "Did you ever see its bright flame?" "All you ever saw were only his flaws" "But his talents you never saw" "A blithe spirit is he" "one in thousands is he" "A blithe spirit is he" "one in thousands is he" "A blithe spirit is he" Sunil, I gotta know just now... you got a first class... with distinction too!
