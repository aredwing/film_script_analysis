Hurry up and break down that door! Where is she?! Here she is! Mama, here she is! She was hiding! Hurry up and catch her! Mama, I'll fall! That's it...that's the stone! Hurry, into the next room!

Put in two meatballs! Working a lot of overtime? Business may finally be picking up again. Still working? Yeah. What's that? That's a person! PAZU! What are you doing up there? What about dinner? Boss! A girl from the sky... Boss, a girl from the sky... #@% worn-out engine! Boss, a girl... Close the #2 valve! Pazu, hand me a wrench. Yes, sir! I can't let go! You do it! Don't keep the people down below waiting. Yes, sir! Keep calm...you can do it. Yes, sir! Brake! How was it? It's no use. The silver isn't concentrated anywhere. Digging here is useless... Shouldn't we have dug to the east? That place is just full of old pits. We'll just have to do it over again, won't we? Yes...all over again... That's it... Put out the boiler fire. No overtime tonight. Times are hard. We'll end up starving. Pazu, oil that run-down engine. Yes, sir! It's no use, Mama. We can't find anything in the dark. You think we've searched thoroughly, eh? There's not a trace. We'll start again when it gets light. Well, how do you feel? Hey, wait! Wait, I said! I'm Pazu. I live alone in this house. When I'm done playing, I give them this. I'm relieved. Anyway, you look human. Until a little while ago, I was worried you were an angel or something. Thanks for saving me. I'm Sheeta. Sheeta...that's a nice name. I was surprised by the way you fell out of the sky. I see...Why do you suppose I was saved? After all, I fell out of an airship. You don't remember? Say - can I see that for a minute? This? It's been in my family for generations. A pretty stone, isn't it? Just a second. Watch! Pazu! Looks like it wasn't the stone after all. Pazu, hold on... Are you okay? Yes. And you? I'm fine. Does it hurt? Yes. My head hurts from Boss's fist. Oh, yeah. The pot is boiling. Let's go in and eat. You can wash up over there. There are towels, too. Thank you. Sheeta! Sheeta, ready yet? That's a photograph my father took from an airship. Laputa is an island floating in the sky. An island that floats in the sky? Yeah. They say it's just a legend... but my father saw it! That's the photograph he took. Swift wrote about Laputa in 'Gulliver's Travels', but that was just a story. Father drew this from his memory! There's no one living there any more. There's supposed to be a lot of treasure there. But, nobody believes in it. Father died in Sagi, looking for it. But, my father's not a liar. One day I'll prove it! I'll discover Laputa. An automobile...how rare! They're pirates. They're the ones who attacked the airship. They're after you? Hurry, this way! Good morning! Hey! Wait! What? I'm in a hurry! Has a new girl come to these parts? Baby Madge! She came to Boss's place yesterday. Damn! A coincidence! They're after you, alright. Louie! A girl's dress! What? Disguised? You tell Mama! ...haven't seen her. A cute girl, with dark hair in braids? Boss! Boss! Just about that age... Brother! That's her! They're pirates! They're after this girl. Pirates! Look! That's far enough. We'll get her. Pirates, huh? The Dora Clan. Leave us alone. We're just a poor lot. Mom! Escape out the back! I want to fight, too! They have weapons. But... You'll be a good boy, won't you? Protect her. In any case, we'll get her somehow. Think you're man enough? Settle this with your fists. All right. Do it, brother! Oh, my...show him, Duffy! Wow... And who sewed that shirt? Brother, don't give up! Go! Go! They think they can fool me, do they? Follow them! Get on! Let's go! Pazu - taking the day off? We're being chased. It's the Dora Clan. Pirates? Give us a ride to the next city, and we'll go to the police. All right. Help stoke it! Stupid sons of mine...hurry up and get in! But the girl's in there. She snuck out the back door. Get moving. Wait! Pazu, they're on to you! Can't we go any faster? She's pretty old. Let's change places! Mama, I'm going to fall! More steam...they're gaining on us! Faster! Sheeta, come here! Take care of the stoking! Don't give up! Push! Keep pushing! Hold it! They won't get away. Don't just sit there... push these things off the track! There...running fine! I'll do it. We'll do it together. Wait! It's them, Mama. What'll we do? I'm not giving up just yet! Let's move! We're blocked. It's the army. Hey, please help out these kids. They're being chased by pirates. Farewell! Wait! Stop! Stop, or I'll shoot! It's an armored tank! I don't care! Ram it! Sheeta, what's the matter?! Don't ask! They'll fall! Be quiet. Watch closely! We're floating! See that? The power of the Levistone! It WAS the stone after all! Amazing! It's okay. This way we'll go to the bottom. AMAZING! I want it! Fire! Excellent! I WILL get my hands on it! It's going out. Oh, wait...! It did that when you came floating down, Sheeta. The entrance looks so small. I hope nothing bad happens to your boss or the engineer. It's okay. Miners are tough. Let's go. Since long ago, the mountain's been riddled with mine shafts. Here. Oh, good. I'm awfully hungry. There's an apple and two candies for later. Your bag is like magic. It has everything in it. Gondoa? That's in the northern mountains, isn't it? Yes. When my parents died, they left me the house and farm. I managed alone, somehow. You were kidnapped by those men with dark glasses? The same men we saw? Who could it be...with such an army... Both Dora and the 'dark glasses' want to get the stone... I had no idea there was such a mysterious power in this stone. It has been handed down through my family, since times long past. Mother gave it to me when she died, telling me never to show it or give it to strangers. So, we're both orphans. Forgive me for getting you mixed up in my troubles, Pazu. Don't worry. When you fell from the sky, my heart was pounding. I knew it was the start of something wonderful. Imps...They're imps... Grandpa Pomu! It's okay. He's a very nice man. We're lost! This imp looks just like Pazu... and a little girl imp, too, I see. PWe're being chased by pirates... P P...and by the army, too. Intrepid, aren't you... Well, help yourself. Thank you. Grandpa, do you always stay underground? That's impossible! Since last night, the stars have been making a mysterious commotion... I hope they quiet down soon. The rocks make noise? The stones have small voices... Wow. Pazu - look up. But it was just rock... It's pretty. Now, look at this. It went out. There are Levistone veins inside the rocks here. Levistone? This happens when Levistone touches the air. It fades and becomes just rock. It's glowing. I'm amazed! That's a pure Levistoncrystal... I'm beginning to see n... It's no wonder the stars are so restless! There's a mysterious power in this stone. Only the people of Laputa had the power to make such a thing. The people of Laputa... That was when it floated in the sky over Dekkai Island. There really was a Laputa! Sheeta, it exists, after all. Grandpa, where do you think the island is now? Grandpa Pomu? Sorry, but could you put away the stone? It's too much for me. What's the matter, Grandpa? My grandpa told me... When the stones are noisy, Laputa is over the mines. So, if we went up into the sky now, we could see Laputa! Sheeta, my father wasn't lying! Uhh...Little girl...Umm... Yes? I tell others about stones because that's how I make a living. Listen, the good luck the stones bring people also seems to invite bad luck. What's more. That stone was made by human hands. Remember that... It's not like that! That stone has saved Sheeta twice already, hasn't it? This is amazing! Laputa is real. They've gone. Let's go back to the ship, Mama. Keep quiet. We'll stay here for now. I'm hungry. It's okay, let's go. Thanks, Grandpa. Be careful. Wow...what magnificent clouds... The island is floating, hidden behind the peaks of those clouds. I'll do it! I swear I'll find Laputa! Pazu... There's something I still haven't told you... There's an old, secret name in my family. When I inherited this stone, I inherited that name as well... My inherited name is Lucita... Lucita Toelle Ul Laputa. Laputa - then...! It's the army! Run, Sheeta! Run to the cave! Don't move! What are you doing?! Pazu! Let me go! We've caught them, sir. Did they give you a lot of trouble? Open up! Open up! This is too slow! She'll talk as soon as we lock her up! That's a bad habit of the government. Rush things and both the girl and the investment will suffer, your Excellency. If we'd mobilized the troops in the first place, Dora wouldn't have surprised us. Your Excellency, the coded messages were deciphered. What?! This is a job for my agents. Your Excellency need only move the troops at the right time. Muska! I am the commander of the Laputa investigation. Don't forget that! Of course; and I take my orders directly from the government. Don't forget that. Meddling fool! Did you sleep well? Where's Pazu? I want to see Pazu! Don't you like the latest fashions? Don't worry about him. His head is harder than mine. Come, there's something I want you to see. Go in. What is it...? It has terrible destructive power. It's a robot soldier. If this fellow hadn't fallen out of the sky, nobody would have believed in Laputa. This wasn't made anywhere on the Earth's surface. It has power almost beyond imagining. And its body...metallic? Ceramic? Our scientists still don't know. Look at this. Don't be afraid. It's been inactive since we found it. There. The same symbol that was on the old fireplace in your home... ...and on this necklace. This stone won't work except in your hands. It will protect you until the day you decide to return to Laputa, then it will show you the way. But, I don't know anything! If you want the stone, take it! Leave us alone. You think Laputa is kind of a 'treasure island', don't you? Laputa flies because of an impressive scientific power. It once controlled the whole surface of the Earth with an empire of fear! If a thing like that is still wandering in the skies, is it not a danger to peace? I think you understand. I'd like you to help me. Laputa's location is in the stone. Surely you must know an incantation or something? I really don't know. Let me see Pazu. I don't like to be overdramatic, but that young man's fate is in your hands. If you help us, I'll set him free, Lucita Toelle Ul Laputa. How did you know that? 'Ul' means king in Laputan. 'Toelle' means true. You are the rightful successor of the Laputan royal family, Queen Lucita. Come out. Pazu, are you hurt? I'm okay. But you? They haven't done anything to you, have they? Pazu, I was wrong about you. Please forgive me. I didn't know that you were fighting to protect her from the pirates. Sheeta...what? Pazu, I beg you. Forget about Laputa. What? The army will investigate Laputa with Sheeta's help. I understand how you feel, but I'd like you to keep 'hands off' for a while. Sheeta...is this true? But... Forgive me for troubling you. Thank you. I'll never forget you, Pazu. It can't be...Sheeta...didn't you promise? Goodbye. Wait, Sheeta! If you want to be a man then listen to reason! This is a small, but heartfelt thanks. Take it and go. Remember the words that activate the stone... If you keep your promise, you'll be set free, too. Mama, it's Pazu. Pazu came back! I was worried. Nobody had seen you since yesterday. What happened to that little girl? She's all right. Let me go...what are you doing?! Don't make a fuss. Only staying for a bit, my boy. Get out! This is my house! Big talk for a brat who can't even protect a little girl. Look at all the money he's got! Oh dear, you sold the girl for money? You're wrong! I wouldn't do a thing like that! Then where did you get the money? Sheeta told me to take it! So, I... So you took it and ran... And you call yourself a man? Don't give me that! Weren't you trying to get hold of Sheeta, too? Of course. Pirates are always after treasure! They're strange fellows. Why do they keep kidnapping the girl? Do you think they'll let the girl live? Idiot! She was forced to deal with them to save you! You understand everything, don't you, Mama? I haven't been a woman for 50 years without learning something. Don't you see? She saved your life. Just breaks my heart, it's true love and you don't even shed a tear. If any of you ever marry, find a nice girl like her. Don't you mean like you, Mama? Like that girl? Good...still using the old code! They've summoned a warship. They're leaving with the girl. If we don't hurry, we'll lose them! Move your butts! Let's go! Are you going to go kidnap Sheeta? The girl is nothing, it's the Levistone! But the Levistone by itself is useless! If Sheeta doesn't hold the stone, it won't work! Auntie, won't you take me with you? I want to save Sheeta. You won't be pampered. If you go, you'll have to take care of yourself. I will. If I have the strength, I'll protect her. The treasure of Laputa is worth it! Please... Oh, you're making her cry. Shut up! We don't know if the girl will listen to us, do we? We won't have a second chance. Understood. You'll follow orders? Don't take more than 40 seconds to pack. Take care, everyone. Fasten yourself with this belt. The rest of you, wait on the ship. What an excellent ship! Muska, has the girl talked? I need a little more time. There'll be plenty of time in the air. We leave at dawn with the girl. Hurry up! It'll soon be light! That's too bad. So, Sheeta, I'll tell you something good. A spell for times of trouble. A spell? That's right. Very old, secret words. Lete Latobarita Ulse Aliaros Baru Netoreel It's to save us. It is a wish, 'Light, be reborn'. Lete Latobarita Ulse Aliaros Baru Netoreel Excellent! It was in an old manuscript... this is a holy light... Holy light? What kind of incantation was it? Tell me the words. It's moving! The robot... the robot's alive. Hello?! Help! It's crazy! It's moving. Put out the fire. It's the robot! The robot?! Where does it think it's going? Amazing! I see! It's that light! The seal on the robot was broken by the holy light. It has opened the way to Laputa! Come here! It can fly?! It's nuts! It's piercing the sky. Laputa is in the same direction as that light. Not ready yet? Hurry up! Blasting powder? You idiot; do you want to blow up this fort? Hello? Hello? Hey, what's wrong?! Okay. It's connected. This is Captain Muska. Communication lines are down because of the robot. Take emergency action. I am in temporary command. The robot is trying to get to the girl on the East tower. Kill it the moment it shows itself. Leave fuses off the shells. Don't hurt the girl. Hurry! Hurry! Fire! Forward! It's flattened. Alright! Get the girl! Is she dead? Hey...get up. She's just fainted. Stand up! It moved! What's going on? Looks like a war. Let's go, Auntie! Call me Captain! Charles, fly a little lower. Stop! Stop, already! Please! Mama, the Goliath is moving! If they go, we'll end up flying right into their guns. There she is...it's Sheeta. What? Where? Straight ahead! She's on the top of the small tower! That's a brave girl! Cover us! Sheeta, come on! Auntie, a little closer! Go up! This is our last chance. Grab her as we pass! Go! Get out of the way! Damn! What is the Goliath doing? A smoke screen? Muska, what happened to the robot? The robot was destroyed. The girl has escaped. What? Look sharp...put out the fires! Form search parties! It hasn't lost its holy light. It's still showing the direction of Laputa. Inform the General tt we will depart for Laputa as planned. Nice, isn't she. Hard to believe she'll grow up to be just like Mama. Here's your valley. Glad to be rid of such a useless pair. Auntie, please let us ride on your ship. Call me Captain! You don't have the stone. Why should I let you on board? We'll repay you. I want to see Laputa with my own eyes. What if there isn't any treasure? You're not greedy enough to ride a pirate ship, anyway. Mama, can she come along? If there's any funny business, I'll throw you into the sea! Hurray! A live-in cook. A dishwasher! A potato peeler! Can you make pudding? I like mincemeat pie! And me...well, now, let me see... I'll eat anything! Behave yourselves! Really! Just like children. Careful! It's canvas! This ship is made of canvas! Don't damage it. Don't just stand there! It's crowded here. Hurry up...this way! I hate slackers! You...this way. He's fine. Come on! You aren't here to play! What an amazing engine. Where'd he go? Uncle! Uncle! Uncle...here's the asstant you wanted. NOT SO LOUD!! I ain't deaf. He's worse than Mama. Be careful. It's so cramped, my hand won't go in. It's this packing, isn't it. What's your name? The Levistone pointed due east, did it? From the tower, I could see the sun rise. Now is the mowing season. So the sunrise is a lite south of true east. The sun rose left of the hills. The Levistone light crossed the left tip of the sun's edge. Good answer. How are things up there? I'm getting nothing. So, they're jamming the radio to hide their whereabouts, are they?! Mama, the Goliath's moving pretty fast! What'll we do? We'll be on their windward side. If we use the trade winds... 20,000 feet and ridehe jet stream... With wind speed 10... We'll do it somehow Everybody, listen up! We are setting course for Laputa. Our ship will now commence top-speed pursuit! Using the wind, we should be able to make contact tomorrow! And I'll give 10 gold pieces to the first to spot her! 10 gold pieces! Laputa is some sort of flying island. There's probably enough treasure for everybody. So! Everybody...GET TO WORK! Now! Course 98. Velocity 40! There's nothing your size. Put this on. Here's your post. Five meals a day. Conserve water. You morons! Get back to work! Sorry, dinner isn't ready yet. It's my first airship kitchen. Did you want something? I have some spare time, so I thought I'd be of some help. Well, thank you. Would you do that washing? No problem. Hey, you said your back hurt. I had some spare time and thought I'd help. Out of the way. Don't push. Hey, can I be of some help? So, you were scared too? And they have the Goliath to help them... Sounds hopeless. It's the island of Laputa, so it's no wonder. They're certainly good kids, those two. What do you want me to say, you stupid old man? Nothing. But you should show me more respect. What?! That's checkmate, isn't it? Umm...if anyone wants seconds... Seconds! Hey! Get up. It's your watch. Take this, it's cold out. The lookout? Yeah. It's cold! You're up top. I'm second shift. Thanks. That was scary! It's beautiful. Get in. Can't sleep? It's warm. Sheeta, you look behind. I'm scared beyond words. The truth is, I don't want to go to Laputa at all. I hope we don't find the Goliath. There are just too many strange and powerful...well... You mean like what happened with the robot? That was sad, wasn't it. And it happened because of a spell taught to me by my grandmother. I learned many other spells, too. To find things, and to cure illness and words I must absolutely never use... Words you must never use? Spells of destruction, good spells to bestow power... She said I must also know the bad words but never use them. After I learned them, I was too afraid to sleep. And it all had to do with the stone. It was always hidden in the fireplace, and except at weddings, never used... Mother, and Grandmother, and Grandmother's Grandmother... everybody feared it! I wish it had never existed! You're wrong. I met you, thanks to that stone. And thanks to that stone, Laputa won't be lost. All our progress with flying machines, and no one's seen it but my father. And what if Laputa is really an island of terror? It mustn't fall into the hands of Muska and the others. Besides...if we run away now, we'll be chased forever. But I don't want to make you a pirate for my sake. I won't become a pirate. Even Dora understands. I think she's really a good person. When this is all over, I'm sure she'll take you back to Gondoa. I want to see it. The old house where you were born, and the yaks. What's that?! Underneath the ship...there! It's the Goliath. It's right below us! Hard to starboard! Muska, why aren't we chasing them? They'll get away! It's no use, in the clouds. Anyway, they can't run far! We're on course and everything's going smoothly. The course was more north. Pazu, there's no time. Listen up! If we don't shake off the Goliath, we're finished! You have good eyes. I want you to stay in the lookout. If we leave the clouds, they'll pursue. What should I do? That lookout post will turn into a kite. There should be a handle inside. Found it! If you turn it clockwise, the hook will catch. If you turn the upper handle, the wings will open! When it's open, don't stretch the wire. Remember to steer with your body! Is Sheeta up there? You better come back down! Why? WHY? Because you're a little girl! Auntie, you're a girl, too! Besides, I'm mountain-bred. I have good eyes, too. Please... Pazu agrees with me! If you go up, don't use the voice tube. There's an internal telephone. Is this the phone you were talking about, Auntie? Wow. Yes...we'll try. Let us up! Go! I can't see it. They've dived into the clouds. Be careful. They may not be in front of us. Okay! Hang on tight! What's wrong?! Turbulence...we're okay! Just a little stirred up! Yes! I'll continue the watch. Scared? I've gotten the hang of it now. It's a little stormy. Sheeta, get the rope out of my bag. Tie us together with it. Okay. The barometer is falling fast, Mama. A storm. What rotten luck. How long until sunrise? One hour! It's dawn! Pazu, that's strange. The sun is rising on that side. I see! We must be going north, not east! Bridge! We're going north, you say?! The compass is pointing east! The wind's changed. We're off course! Look...there! What's the matter...the Goliath? The clouds. They're huge. The clouds? They're coming this way! It's a sky castle... THAT'S a low pressure center! The ship won't stand the wind. Full power! Due north! It's coming closer! All right! We're trying! The rudder won't move! Always the damn power! What's wrong? Dora! The engine'll burn up! I don't want any complaints! Just do it! Get out of the clouds! Sheeta, it's the ocean! The Dragon's Nest! This...is the Dragon's Nest?! The wind is blowing in the wrong direction, just like father said. It's a wall of wind! Mama, we can't get out! We're being sucked in. The wind just won't quit! Bridge! Laputa is in there! What? Father saw Laputa in the Dragon's Nest! You're crazy! If we go in, we'll be torn apart! Over there! Now, of all times...! Let's go, Auntie! It's the way Father took, and he came back! ALL RIGHT! Let's go... into the Dragon's Nest! Yeah! We did it! Our ship is in danger, too. We must retreat. No! Carry on. The light always indicates the center of the whirling clouds. Laputa is inside the storm. Steady as she goes. There must be an entrance. Hang on, Sheeta! Sheeta! Are you okay? Look... Laputa... Sorry! Wait; it's still pretty tightly knotted. My hands are shaking. There are birds here. What do you suppose happened to everyone? It's coming to meet you, Sheeta. But I don't have the Levistone. A knife will free us. What are you doing!? Wait! Please, don't break that. We can't go back without it. It's a Hitaki nest! It came because of this? Oh, good...the eggs aren't broken. Not afraid, are they? Let's follow it. Do you know the words? Don't worry about that! It's a city! We must be inside the buildings. Sheeta, the sky... It looked like stone walls from the outside. But, if their science was so advanced, why...? It's a tomb, isn't it? Forgotten writing... Did you do this? It's not the same robot as before! It must be a gardening robot. There weren't any people... Who knows how long it's been standing guard here. You offered flowers before the tomb? Thank you. You're all alone? Aren't there any other robots here? Doesn't look lonely at all, does it... It has friends. Cares for the Hitaki nests, too. It won't die. This way! The floor has crumbled. The Tiger Moth made it. Auntie and the others are probably okay. Sheeta...over there! Everyone was caught! They've tied them up. Can't we rescue them? Let's go! We've opened a way into the city. Look at this... there's a mountain of treasure inside! Wow. Do you like this? Want it? You'll all get enough...rope that is! Did you notify our country of the discovery of Laputa? I'll do it now. Try to set up a difficult code. HEY, NO STEALING! Those fools are just blind enough. Amazing, these roots... Sheeta, you can climb trees, right? Let's go. What they're doing is terrible... If they go to the upper gardens... Sheeta, we've got to get the Levistone back. Only that will protect this place from those thieves. Why have the clouds cleared? If it hadn't been like this, they wouldn't have been able to land. The effect of my spell... This must be what Muska meant about 'the seal being broken'. This castle is awakened, because the holder of the Levistone approached, riding on the storm. If we don't act, Muska will become king... and, after the plunder, terrible things will start to happen. But how can I get the Levistone back? Those words... Those words? Impossible...but... We'll go around from below. I'll jump first. It's around here. Dear God... This is it! It's that brat! Damn! Don't shoot. I'll catch her! Well, well...a queen. Captain, what's going on? The rest of the pirates. One of them is hiding at your feet. Yes sir! Find him! Hold it! Get me a hand grenade! It's Pazu. What? It's not what you think! Guards, fall in! Hurry! Auntie! They have Sheeta. I'm going to rescue her. After I cut the ropes, get out of here. Get far away! Hey, wait! Take these. Thanks. That boy will go far. What?! Muska broke all the radios? Yes, sir. We caught his men hiding inside the ship. Many of the bridge crew are seriously wounded. The Captain is inside the lower hemisphere. Some of the men saw him go in. Traitor! He's finally showing his true colors. Gather the troops. This is a spy hunt! Gather all squads! Hurry up, squad 3. Muska and his men are to be shot on sight. Find the entrance! Captain, what in the world is this place? The nerve center of Laputa. The castle and treasure above are just rubbish. The science of Laputa is completely stored in here. You will wait here. Captain! Beyond here, none but the royal family may enter. It's a sanctuary. What's this? Tree roots, this deep? One phrase, and it will all be reduced to ashes. Come on...this way. Here it is! Here, too? Found it! Look at this huge Levistone! This is the source of Laputa's power. Excellent. For 700 years it has been waiting for the return of the king. 700 years? Your clan forgot, didn't it? It's the black stone! Just like in the legend! I can read it! I can read it! Who in the world are you? I also have an old, secret name, Lucita. My name is Romuskaalo Ul Laputa. Your clan and mine were originally one royal family. But when we returned to the earth, it divided into two. Not a crack. It's not ordinary stone. Use all the bombs we've got! Your Excellency, you cannot get in like that. Muska, where are you? Well...what are you waiting for? Do come inside, your Excellency. Yes. Follow me! Follow His Excellency! Wh...what is this place? Muska...come out! Be silent. What kind of trick is this? Be quiet. You are before the King of Laputa. Are you mad? Today, we celebrate the rebirth of a monarchy. The rebirth of a global empire under one king. Let me show you gentlemen the power of Laputa. It is the heavenly fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament, and the arrows of heaven which took Ramayana, Indora, and Atlantis. The whole world will bow to Laputa again! Excellent, Muska...you're a hero. Now here is your reward. The look on your face! Run, everybody! Die! Those fools! It's full of them... Everybody...RUN! Check the flapters! Mama, let's fly! Hurry, let's get away! Be quiet. Don't raise your voices. Why are those two waiting behind? They'll end up falling. I hope you don't anger me again... ...because it looks like we'll be spending some time together. I do hope they're not trying to get away. They really intend to fight me. Robots. Excellent! Don't you think that this is a great show? Look! The people - they look like garbage. What are you doing? Give it back. Be a good girl. Come on. Please...open up! Where do you think you're going? Open up! Sheeta! I'm coming through! Get down! Hurry, take this! Muska's here! Throw it in the ocean. That stone you have is important. I'll trade the girl's life for it. Get up! The game is over. The old throne room isn't very splendid, is it? Come here! You say this is the throne room? This is our grave. Our country was destroyed, and a king like you survived. How tragic! I won't give you the stone. You can't leave here without killing me. Why was Laputa destroyed? I know perfectly well. There's a song in the valley of Gondoa. Let our souls fall to the earth; Live as one with the winds. Pass the winter along with the seeds, and sing together with birds for spring. No matter how many weapons you have, or how many poor robots you use, you cannot live, parted from the earth. Laputa will not be destroyed. However many times, it will be reborn. The power of Laputa is the dream of the human race. Your ears will be next. On your knees! Beg for your life! Get the stone back from the brat! Wait! I hid the stone. If you shoot her, I won't return it. Pazu...stay away; it's no use. He's going to kill us, no matter what. Brat...the girl's life for the stone. Tell me where it is. Or, are you just going to scare me with that cannon? I want to talk with Sheeta - alone. It's no use...throw the stone away and run! I'll give you three minutes. Sheeta...calm down. Listen closely. Tell me those words. I'll say them, too. The stone is in my left hand. I've freed Auntie and the others. Time's up! Let's hear your answer. Ba lusu! My eyes...my eyes! My eyes! Mama, it's collapsing! It can't be helped...launch! Hurry! Mama, look! The bottom is falling off! Sheeta was a good girl. She used the words of destruction... Those children protected Laputa from those idiots. The collapse has stopped! It's the Levistone! What luck! It's going up. The tree! It may have them! Follow it! The tree roots saved us. We'll break the wire. Let's go. What are you doing? We're supposed to be going up! We can't like this! It's Sheeta! They're alive. It's the apprentice. Auntie! Safe and alive, aren't you? Everyone's okay! Everyone's okay except for my poor, tattered ship. Don't be so sentimental. You can build another ship. Poor thing... what a cruel way to get a haircut... Auntie...ouch! Oh, sorry. Isn't it terrible? Worrying so, while full of these! At any rate, we worried in our spare time... # The reason the horizon shines # ano chiheisen kagayaku no wa # is that somewhere it's hiding you. # dokoka ni kimi o kakushite iru kara # The reason I long for the many lights # takusan no hi ga natsukashii no wa # is that you are there in one of them. # ano doreka hitotsu ni kimi ga iru kara # So, I set out, with a slice of bread, # saa dekake you hitokire no PAN # a knife, a lamp, stuffed in a bag. # NAIFU RAMPU kaban ni tsumekonde # Father left me his burning desire. # tou-san ga nokoshita atsui omoi # Mother gave me her eyes. # kaa-san ga kureta ano manazashi # The earth turns, hiding you. # chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o kakushite # Shining eyes, twinkling lights. # kagayaku hitomi kirameku tomoshibi # The earth turns, carrying you, # chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o nosete # carrying us both who'll surely meet. # itsuka kitto deau bokura o nosete # Father left me his burning desire. # tou-san ga nokoshita atsui omoi # Mother gave me her eyes. # kaa-san ga kureta ano manazashi # The earth turns, hiding you. # chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o kakushite # Shining eyes, twinkling lights. # kagayaku hitomi kirameku tomoshibi # The earth turns, carrying you, # chikyuu wa mawaru kimi o nosete # carrying us both who'll surely meet. # itsuka kitto deau bokura o nosete
