Doggone that kid. Look at this. I hope hes all right. Younguns fall light. Hes used to it. He could get hurt. Saddle Shorty. I better go see. Ja, Boss. Never mind, Gus. Ken. Yes, sir? Come here. You all right? Sure, Im all right. Cigarette toss you again? Yes, sir. You ""digged"" your heels in her. I didnt. Did you, Son? Yes, sir. Ken, arent you ever going to grow up? Ive told you not to clap your heels into her. Look at that bridle. Second one youve broken this week. Im sorry, Dad. Oh, you found the saddle blanket. What saddle blanket? I lost it yesterday afternoon. You forgot to cinch the saddle properly. Yes, sir. Gee whiz, its all ""tored."" Will you keep quiet? It got caught on some barbed wire. Youre the doggonest kid... for losing, busting, and forgetting. Breakfast is all ready. Wheres Ken? Hes coming. Cigarette tossed him again. I dont know what Ill do with that boy. Doesnt pay any attention to what I say. Always losing equipment or breaking it somehow. Hes still a child. Hes old enough to have his wits about him. Hes walking around with his head in the clouds. Its a wonder he doesnt trip. Morning, Mom. Come on, darling. Eat your oatmeal while its hot. Good heavens. What is it? Kens report card. I suppose youre not surprised you havent been promoted. No, sir. Here, look at your marks. Let him eat his breakfast first. Just as a matter of curiosity... how do you go about getting a zero on an examination? 40 in history, 1 7 in arithmetic, but a zero? Just as one man to another, what goes on in your head? What have you got to say for yourself? Nothing, sir. What were the questions you missed... in that English exam? We were to write a composition. Couldnt you think of anything? I was going to write... about how you lost your polo mare... how the albino stole her from Banner. Well, why didnt you? I got to thinking. I thought we had time. I thought the hour had just begun... when the school bell rang. You never even got started. Not a single word, Ken? No. Just daydreaming, huh? No, I was thinking about-- About what? About my colt. You havent got a colt. Dad, give me a colt, wont you? Youll get one when you learn how to treat one. Youll have to buck up. Trouble is, you dont try. I do try, Dad. Id like to see some proof. Meantime, youll study an hour a day... to make up your work. [Knock On Door] Come in. Good morning, Missus. Good morning, Gus. Whats today, Boss? Good day to move the horses. Its time they were off the meadows. A storms cooking up. Can I help? Four older horses have to be in shape for the rodeo... and those three-year-olds have to be broke. Cant I help move them? Great guns, no. Its tough enough to move 1 00 horses... all fresh as blazes after a winter out... without a kid along to make them nervous. - Ill be right out. - Ja, Boss. Want another cup of coffee, dear? No, I had enough. Got to get started. Kenny, you can ride any horse on the ranch. Why are you so set on having a colt? It isnt just riding. I want a colt to be friends with me. I want a colt of my own, all my own. You better start your studying. Get it over with. Bye, Daddy. Bye. Ken, what are you doing? Im doing my arithmetic, Mom. [Alarm Rings] Where are we going? To watch Dad bring in the horses. We can take the shortcut. No, you better stay here. Its tough enough bringing in 1 00 horses... all fresh after a winter out... without having a girl tagging along making them nervous. Those horses aint scared of me. Good morning. Nice work, Banner. Banner dont let those mares get away with nothing. Banners got everything it takes to make a great horse-- brains, heart, and courage. If hed just pass it on to all the colts. What horses wed have then. Whoa now! Whoa now! Whoa there! Look out, Gus. Theyre stampeding! Gus, try to head them off. Stop them, Banner! Theyre making straight for the rock slide. Head them off, Banner. [Whinny] [Whinny] [Whinny] What are you doing here? I--I came to see the horses. I didnt mean to do it. I didnt mean to scare them. [Whinny] Jeepers, if I could ever have a colt like that. Are we on the downgrade? I never had so many bills and less money to pay them. We cant sell our horses at a profit. Theyre good horses with good blood. Mm-hmm, all but that albino strain. They got a crazy streak in them. No use trying to sell them. I wouldnt even get back the cost of raising them. Id rather shoot them. I would, too, if they werent so doggone fast. I hoped to get one decent colt out of that bunch. Rob... give Ken a colt. Huh? I want you to give Ken a colt. After that stunt he pulled this morning? You know he didnt mean to. He doesnt deserve a colt. Wont you ever give him one? Sure. Ive been expecting to. If he pays attention to his studies-- Uh-uh. No. Thats another thing. That isnt going to get anzwhere. Didnt he study today? He exposed himself to his books. Good heavens. Nothing I say to him makes any impression. He wants his own colt. He cant think of another thing. But thats all backwards. You dont bribe children to do their duty. Its not a bribe. What would you call it? I just have a feeling... Ken isnt going to pull anything off. Its time he did. Maybe a little thing like this... would turn the trick. That isnt a little thing. It isnt easy to break and school a colt. I wont have a good horse spoiled by his carelessness. Rob, its important. Hes got to succeed at something. What he needs is-- Is to snap out of it. If you want to put it that way. He needs to grow up. How would having his own colt help? Oh, you know. Something of his own... responsibility. Hed have something real that he cared about... more than those things he goes mooning about. Dont go. Id like to give Ken a colt. Id like to get closer to the boy somehow... but every time I get set for a get-together session... he hands me a facer like what he pulled today. Rob, didnt you ever want anything... more than anything else in the world? Yes. You. You do understand. [Whinny] [Whinny] [Humming] Wheres Ken? Probably looking at the ducks on the landing. For Petes sake, what ducks on what landing? That old print of mine. He likes to look at them. Gus says Rocket broke away last night. Thinks shes got a colt somewhere. Well have to look for her. Ill find her. Good. Ill go with you. Son, Im taking back yesterdays order. You can forget that hour of study. Thanks, Dad. And, Ken... Im going to give you a colt. A colt? A colt of my own? Mm-hmm. Ill give it to you a week from today. Thatll give you time to make your own choice. I can have any colt on the ranch? - Ayearling? - Thats right. Gosh. Jeepers, maybe I can have the one I saw yesterday. Come on, you old jughead. Come on there. Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, step on my foot, would you? Come on. Why dont you take Highboy for your colt? That chump? Dont think Im riding Cigarette because I want to. Its because I have to. Then how about Lassie? Shes as fast as anything and black as ink. Who said I wanted a black horse? How about College Boy? Hes smart like a fox. Im going to pick a filly. I know the one I want, too. I hope I find her. Hey, dont do that again, Hildy. Cigarettes kind of nervous. She might kick you. She better dont. Ill kick her back. Thanks, Tim. OK. Ready, Ken? Yes, sir. Dont see why I cant go, too. Youre a girl. Thats why. Check your cinch? Yes, sir. Lets go. Ken, dont you want your hat? Oh, thanks, Mom. Dont see why I cant be a boy. Even youre a boy... I guess. Maybe you think its funny, giving you a colt... when you deserve a good hiding. Flunking all your exams... then pulling that stunt yesterday. Dont think Im letting you off. Im not. I havent gone soft. Dont get that into your head. I expect as much now as I ever did. This isnt any reward... because you havent won any reward. This is a partnership. One of these days, Ill need your help. You have to be trained so you can give it. Every man needs training. Discipline. I got mine at West Point. And how. Youre going to train that colt. Ill help you with the first breaking... but youll train it, and itll train you. Yes, sir. You and your mother may have to care for this ranch... without me pretty soon. Where will you be? I may have to go back into the army. You understand, dont you? Yes, sir. You make a good pony out of that colt... and let it make a man out of you. Yes, sir. I rode all through here yesterday. I didnt leave any colts behind. If Rocket had a colt, she wouldnt leave it. I saw a colt yesterday... that got separated from the bunch in the stampede-- a sorrel filly with a cream mane and tail. Sounds like Rockets yearling. Rockets? The filly sired by Banner last spring. Thats what was wrong with Rocket-- she missed that little filly. Shed very likely console herself with a yearling. Should pick up a track around here someplace. Hey, Boss! A cat. Thats a mountain lion, all right. Ja. A big one. Havent had one around here for a long time. Good thing we got the brood mares out of here. Maybe we better look around that cave. Well, it got one of them. Its dark brown. Its Rockets, I guess. Tim was right. She had one. Didnt she know it was dead? Yes and no. Mares are funny about death. Theyll leave a dead foal... then remember it and hunt for it. Will the mountain lion get any other horses? Not now, Kenny. Theyre all out on the range. Cant he get the horse and colts there? Not where theres no cover. Their only chance is surprise. If a horse is off by itself... a lion will jump on it, bite through the spine. Quick kill. [Whinny] Its Rocket. And her filly. What a pretty little flicka she is. Flicka What does that mean? Swedish for ::little girl. Flicka. Thats what Ill call her. My colt. Your colt? Yes, sir. Thats the one I want. Rockets filly, Ken? Yes, sir. I hoped youd make a wiser choice. You know how I feel... about Rockets line of horses. But shes fast. Rockets fast, too. Theyre my worst horses. Theres not one among them with any real sense. The mares are hellions, the stallions outlaws. Theyre untamable. Ill tame her. Nobodys ever been able to tame a one of them. You want a horse thatll be a friend? Yes, sir. Youll never make a friend of her. Look what they did to get back together. No fence in the world will ever hold them. You better change your mind. No. OK, Ken. I promised you could make your own choice. But remember-- Rockets loco... and 1 0-to-1 the colt is, too. But she may not be. Banners her father. All right. Well bring her in tomorrow or the next day. Its silly to write horses names on things. Horses cant read. People can read. But Pop cant. Besides, you aint even got a horse yet. What do you mean I havent got a horse? Well, it aint here. Dads bringing her in today. [Honk Honk] [Honk Honk Honk] Thats Mr. Sergent. Hes got lots of race horses. Hes got a fat belly, too. Hey, Gus, is Rob around? Ja. Hes in the house. Hi, Rob. Hi, Charley. How you been doing? Good. You? Swell. Glad to see you. Sit down. Rob, Im shipping a carload of horses to Los Angeles. Maybe youd like to go in on the deal... and share the shipping expenses. Might do that. Theres room in the car for four more horses. Sounds pretty good. You know, Pop says Flickas loco... like her mother. Dont say that, Hildy. Well, aint her fault. She cant help it if her moms crazy, can she? Banners got sense. She could be like her father, couldnt she? I dont know. When I do something dumb... Mom says I take after the old man... and when I do something smart... Pop says I sure dont take after the old lady. You havent got anything like Rocket. That she-devil can outrun... any animal youve ever seen. Youre crazy. Like to make a bet? Hello, Charley. Well, hello there, Nell. No. Dont get up. I only have a minute. What are you two talking about? Rocket. If I could get a mare to do #5 miles an hour-- Shell make you a fortune... if you could break her. My broncobuster can break any horse. He can do it if shes worth breaking. Worth it? Didnt I tell you? How much do you want? - 500. - 500. Dollars. You got a stopwatch? No. I got a speedometer. Good enough. Lets go. Ill get lunch ready for you. [Honking] There they are. Isnt Flicka beautiful? [Honk Honk] Shes heading for the north range. Well clock her there. The grounds flat. [Honk Honk] Shes like a locomotive. Does she always run with her nose up? Yeah. Shes a stargazer. [Honk Honk] [Honk Honk] Look at the speedometer. Faster, Boss. She aint half trying. [Honk Honk] If she does #5, Ill buy her. Jumping jeepers! Well, what do you say? Its a deal... if shes delivered sound in wind and limb. Just how youll do that is anybodys guess. You leave that to me. Look out for Rocket. Get in there, get in there! Tim, throw a rope on her. [Whinny] Wont be easy to get her in. Stay with her, Tim. Come on! Get that noose off her neck. Be careful, Rob. Think Id deliver her with string hanging on her? I put it on. Im going to get it off. Look out! Open that chute gate so she can see through. Get in there. Shut the gate. Get the truck. Whoa. Thats it. Sergent expects her in good shape. Try not to skin her up. Get her out of here. Well, thats that. You mean thats $500. Itll come in mighty handy, wont it? Dad, look! Oh, Rob. That finished her. Well? Shes dead. Poor old Rocket. Its too bad, but these things will happen. Just takes little lick to kill horse. Theres one thing I can still do. Hello, Williams? This is McLaughlin. OK. Thanks. Look, Williams, I got a load of horses for you. Yeah, those albinos. Yep. Every one of them, Rockets whole tribe. There should be some good horseflesh among them. All right, your own price. Good. Yep. There are nine of them. Wait a minute. There may be 1 0. Ken, come here. Heres a chance to do a sensible thing. I want you to choose another colt... and let me sell Flicka to Mr. Williams. Im asking for your sake as well as mine. Whats the use having another Rocket? You saw what happened. Im going to tame Flicka. Thats impossible. Sometimes bad horses get tamed. You dont want a loco horse, do you? I want Flicka. Look at me. Dad, please. Shes mine. Sorry to keep you waiting, Williams. I thought there was one more. No. There are only nine. Right. Ill send them over. So long. Haw! Haw! Git! Well, thats that. Sure is a wild one. Well let her think it over. Shell go right through that wire. Shell never go over. It turned her. Dad, she has got sense. Flicka! I knew it, that crazy-- Rob, hurry! Whoa, whoa! Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! There now. Dont think shell pull out of it. Maybe its just as well. Hadnt been this way, it wouldve been another. A loco horse isnt worth the bullet... it takes to shoot it. Now easy, girl. Flicka. Eat your dinner, Kenny. Do I have to, Mom? You heard what your mother said. Flicka, shes-- Let him go to her. He cant do her any good. Gus and Tim dressed her cuts. She snaps out of it, shes got water and oats. Oh, Flicka, I didnt mean to hurt you. Get well. Please be all right. Gee, she was pretty. What do you mean ::was? She is. Shes beautiful. I meant when she was running back there. Say, Ken. Tomorrow, if you want to take care of her... Ill do your work for you. Would you, Hildy? Gee, thatd be keen. Sure. Ill exercise Cigarette... bring in the wood, and dry the dishes. You can stay with Flicka all the time... except when youre sleeping. Thanks, Hildy. [Rooster Crows] [Ring] Gus, shes going to be all right, isnt she? Pretty good chance... if we could get her to eat. Maybe she dont like oats. Ill get her some hay. Whoa. Dont run away, Flicka. Dont be afraid of me. Im Ken. This is hay. Youll like it. Have some. Take it easy. Shes been scared pretty bad. Shes eating. Shes going to get well. Ja. Its good sign. Move her to the calf pasture. Theres shade there and a running stream. And shell be alone. I thought horses like company. Not her. Shes a lone wolf. She might jump out of the calf pasture and get away. She wont jump out. She wont jump anything for a long time. [Whistling] Ken. Breakfast. Coming, Dad. Whats he so chipper about this morning? Flicka. Shes better. Coming along, huh? Mm-hmm. Shes almost well. The cuts are all healed up... and shes eating like a horse. Ooh. Maybe were going to have a pleasant summer after all... if she doesnt turn out to be another Rocket. Oh, I hope not. Ken, what kind of manners is that? Sorry, Mom. Morning, Dad. Morning, Ken. How were the ducks on the landing this morning? What ducks on what landing? Oh. Those. Hardly noticed them. Been so busy with Flicka. Now that Flickas getting better... dont forget youve got other duties. Oh, yes, sir. Give some time to your colt... but not all your time. I wont. Will you come down... and look at Flicka this morning... see how she is? Will Her Highness let you get near her? Well, not too close. Shes still a little scared. But shell let you look at her... from the other side of the fence. Thats big of her. After breakfast, Ill take a look. Oh, swell. Ooh! Kenny. Good morning, Flicka. Flicka, Dads coming to look at you. Be a good girl and dont run away. Well, she does look good. Her cuts are all healed up... except for the one on the right front leg. Its almost well. Shes beautiful. Dad? Do you think shes... loco? Id have sworn it by the way shes behaved... ever since she was born. In fact, weve never seen her... except when shes looked terrified. Every horse looks wild in the eye... when its terrified. She tried jumping that fence. Anyone can try the impossible once. Theres the old saying-- ::It couldnt be done... but the darn fool did it anzway. Horses have jumped over 6 feet. Maybe Flicka thought she could do it. Well forgive her that one. Point is, will she learn? Can she learn? Rocket couldnt. Or wouldnt. Dad, maybe Ill never get her trained. Heavens, Son, what have I been telling you... all these weeks? Didnt you understand? What did you think loco meant? Sort of goofy or wild-- hard to handle. Oh, no, Son. Much more serious than that. Theres inherited insanity among animals... just as there is among humans. Bad blood carries on... and albino blood isnt safe for any filly to have. But you said... maybe its just because shes been scared. Shes got a very intelligent face. Much better than Rockets. Fine, delicate mouth. And such lovely eyes. Mm-hmm. Set far apart. Well have to see how she responds to training. How can I train her? All you can do is try and win her confidence. You know, Son, if you take everything away... from a living creature-- freedom, friends, its home, habits... happiness-- itll turn in sheer need and desperation... to the one thing thats left. In this case, thats you. Me? Yes. Youre her whole life now. Make her to like it. Oh, I will, Dad. I will. Give her love and companionship. Talk to her. Will she understand me? Of course. A horse can tell you a lot of things, too... if you watch and expect it to be sensible and intelligent. Pay attention to all the little signs. The way it moves its body. The ears. The eyes. The whinnies. Thats its way of talking, Ken. Thats right. Theres a neigh of terror. A scream of rage. A whinny of nervous impatience. [Flicka Snorts] The nicker of longing or hunger... or friendliness. You learn its language, and itll learn yours. And never forget-- horses understand everything you say to them. Everything, Dad? Everything. [Flicka Snorts] You mean... if theyre not loco. [Whinny] [Whinny] [Whinny] All right, all right... youre hungry for your oats... but Im hurrying as fast as I can. There. There you are. Come and get it. Good, isnt it? You do understand me, dont you, Flicka? Eat it all so youll be big and strong like Banner. Youve got a very smart father, Flicka. Youve got to forget all your wild ways... and be just like him. Who are you talking to? Flicka. Aw, horses cant understand peoples talk. Thats all you know. Flicka understands everything I say. Whats more, she talks back to me. Aw, poo. Maybe you dont know it... but horses got a language all their own. Theres a neigh of terror... a scream of rage... a whinny of nervous impatience... a nicker of longing-- Eee-h-h-h! Theres a nicker of hunger. R-r-r-r. Can you wiggle your ears? Oh... [Whinny] Whats she saying now? Oh, shes telling me shes finished her oats. Oh. Maybe shes saying thank you, too. Maybe she wants more oats. [Whinny] Maybe shes had too many. Maybe shes got a pain in her stomach. Maybe she needs some castor oil. Only gluttons need castor oil. [Whinny] [Whinny] She wants something. Oh, I know. Shes thirsty. Why dont you go and get a drink? Theres a whole lake full of water. Oh, all right. Boy, you sure are getting spoiled. Oh, gosh. I forgot. Your Pops back. For Petes sake. Why didnt you tell me? Ive got to see him right away! [Whinny] You hear that? That means she doesnt want me to go. Aw, I betcha it just means... shes got gas on her stomach. [Whinny] Bet you I didnt forget anything this time. Flour, salt, ham-- What about my hairpins? How could I forget anything as important as hairpins? Theyre in there. Dad! Dad, did you get it? Get what? You know. Sorry. I forgot all about it. You did get it, didnt you? Sure, I did. Its a beauty. Where is it? Well,just a minute, Son. Your work done? Yes, sir. Did you exercise Cigarette? Yes, sir. Shes in her own pasture... and I tied the gate. Good. Is she hot? No, sir. I cooled her off on the way home. Give her a good workout? Yes, sir, and I didnt lose or break anything. Good work, Son. Youre really coming along. Can I have it now? Its in the front seat. You were right, Nell. The filly sure did the trick. Hes a changed boy. Flicka! Flicka, Ive got something for you! Look. Brand-new saddle blanket. Tailor-made especially for you. Isnt it keen? When you grow up, well put it on you. Wont even know youve got a saddle on your back. Well go riding on the range... fly like the wind. Look. Got your name on it. Oh, Flicka, I didnt mean to scare you. Honest, I didnt. Come back, Flicka. Oh, please come back. You dont have to have it. I wont ever ride you... or put a saddle on you... if you dont want me to. Youll just be my friend. [Whinny] Mom... did you ever want anything terribly? Most everyone wants something, dear. But youve grown up. Youre married. Youve got Dad and me. Why, youre finished. Then I shouldnt still be wanting, should I... if Im finished? But people do, Ken. Everyone? Always, Mom? Dont you ever really get finished? Yeah, I wonder. Maybe sometimes, for a minute or two. What is it you want now, Ken? I do so want Flicka to be all right and not loco. Oh, perhaps she isnt loco, dear. We dont know yet for sure... but if she is, Ken... wanting wont change it. If she is, itll look bad for her, wont it? Lets see what happens when we try to halter-break her. Does she have to be? Weve got to find out, dont we? I suppose so. As soon as shell let you touch her... well have a try at it. What if she wont let us? She loves you, doesnt she? Oh, yes. Im sure she does. Well, that shows shes intelligent. How does it, Mom? Its just a way of putting away fear. Dont you understand, Ken... that if you find love... if a person or an animal finds love... its the same as finding safety. Its comfort and friendliness and help. Everyone longs for it. And if Flickas found it... and yet doesnt have sense enough... to know shes found it... and goes around being crazy and silly with fear, then-- Then shed be loco. [Humming] Good morning. Whered you catch them? At that deep hole under the falls. Put them in here. Thank you. Well, Boss, what today? Look over the mowing machines. We have to get at the haying soon. Those stackers need repairs. Oh, Gus. Before we begin... I want to help Ken halter-break his filly. I want you and Tim to be on hand. Where, Boss? The calf pasture, and well do it right now. But, Dad, maybe... maybe we better wait a little while. Shell let you close to her now, wont she? Oh, yes. Flickas my friend now. She likes me, but-- Good. Im glad to hear that. Its a fine thing to have a horse for a friend. Flickas never had a rope around her neck. She may fight us putting one on her now. Maybe shell act like she did when she arrived. Maybe shell act like Rocket. She has to be halter-broken sometime. Might as well get it over with. Get ready. Ill be right down. Didnt you find a broken mule shoe last night? Yes. Thats good luck, aint it? Yes, but if I make a mistake... Dad may blame it on Flicka. And then he wouldnt-- Call her, Ken. Flicka! Have your loop ready, Tim. [Whistles] Put your bandanna around her neck. Tie it in a loose knot. Easy, Flicka. Easy. Now take your belt off. Slip it through the bandanna. Now take ahold of the belt and lead her around. All right. Now bring her back. Let go of the loop. Hold your hand under her chin. Thats it. Id call that halter-broken. But it isnt a halter, Dad. You really take some convincing, young man. All right. Give us the halter, Gus. There you are. Put it on her. Go ahead, Son. But how, Dad? Just the way you put it on Cigarette. All right, now lead her around again. How did she get halter-broke, Dad? Thats the way we break horses... on the Goose Bar ranch. You figure it out, Ken. Come on, boys. Lets get at those machines. Then shes not loco. Shes not loco. You could have knocked me down with a feather. I knew she liked me pretty well, but gosh... she let me halter-break her... without even an argument. Flickas a smart filly, just like her father. All girls are smart like their pops. [Whinny] Shes calling me. She sure is, Kenny. Thats the nicker of friendliness. Bet you shes just hungry. Gus, somethings happened to her! Shes limping. Somethings wrong with her front leg. Flicka, whats the matter? Whats happened to you? Its that barbed-wire cut. But that was all healed up. But it didnt heal right. The legs swollen. Is that bad? Means infection. Infection? Thats dangerous, isnt it? You betcha. Hildy, you talk too much. I think it hurts her. She aint bearing any weight on it. What do you do for a horse infection? Just the same like for people-- put on poultice so itll drain. Ill get Mom to make a poultice. Ja, I think you better. She has got sense, hasnt she, Mom? She knows were helping her, doesnt she? Of course she does. Shes a good little girl... and well get her out of this in no time. Slack off!. Rip it! Dad, Id like to talk to you. What about? About Flicka. For the love of Mike, cant you see Im busy? Cant be worrying about that filly. Im sorry, Dad. Just a minute, Ken. What is it, Son? Flicka worse? Dad, shes so sick. Will you come down and see her? Maybe you can do something to help her. All right. Ill come have a look at her. Shes lying down again. Good heavens. Whats happened to her? Shes been getting awfully thin. Thin! Im afraid she aint going to pull out of it. Pull out of it? Shes dead already. How longs she been like this? Shes been real sick the last few days. Its the fever. Its burning her up. Shes going to die. Well have to put her out of her misery. Oh, no, Dad. Im sorry, Ken. It isnt fair to an animal... to let it suffer like this. Pick a time when Ken isnt around. Gus! Gus, when are you going to do it? I was--I was going down soon now, Kenny. Dont do it tonight. Wait till morning. Just one more night. Gus. Well, in the morning, then. Its got to be done. Your father gave the orders. I know. I wont say anything more. [Dog Barks] Shhh. Im coming, Flicka. Im coming. Flicka? Flicka, where are you? Oh, my little Flicka. Give him one of these every hour. Ill call to see him tomorrow morning. Hes a very sick boy. It isnt only the cold and fever-- He had a shock, Dr. Scott. Something happened-- Hes been sad about a horse I gave him. Its been sick. Oh, I see. Well, youd better have this prescription filled right away. Ill follow you into town... and bring it right back. Dont worry. How is the little boy, Missus? Gus, hes so sick. Poor little boy. [Thunder] Gus, is Flicka dead? No. Tim and me fixed her up in a blanket sling. She cant stand alone... but she drank a bucket of water. Did Rob say you didnt have to shoot her? No, but I couldnt do it. When I found them like that this morning, I-- I know what you mean. Shes got plenty of strength. Sometimes I think, Gus, miracles can still happen. It was the water washing the fever out of her... but it was Ken giving her courage. All night that little fella sitting by her... saying, ::Hold on, Flicka. ::Im here with you. The two of us together. Ill tell Ken. Maybe it will help him get well... knowing shes still alive. Theres a storm coming up, Missus. Ill stay here if you need me. Thank you, Gus. [Thunder] I thought youd never get here. How is he? Better. Hes been resting. Good. We need some hot water. Did you do as I told you? Boss, I couldnt. I gave the order, and youve had plenty of time. I just couldnt do it. Wheres the rifle? In the bunkhouse. Go get it. Oh, Rob, please dont. He knows shes alive. He thinks shell get well. Give him something to hope for. [Thunder] Would have been better if she were shot weeks ago. Its been nothing but misery for everyone. Look what its done to Ken. I wish you wouldnt, Rob. He neednt know. Hell hear the shot. Hell think its thunder. Hell know its the rifle. Im sorry, but... its just no good letting sick animals live. Its raining. The rain wont hurt her, darling. Flickas been out in thunderstorms all her life. That was Dads car, wasnt it, Mom? Yes, dear. [Whinny] [Growl] Please, darling. It was only the thunder. [Whinny] Dont worry about the cat. Im staying with you for the night. Feel a lot better if I had a drink... and some dry clothes. Im a drowned rat... but so are you. Rob! Oh, Rob. Yeah? You all right? Sure. Kens asleep. Gus is with him. I got worried about you. [Whinny] But I thought-- I heard a shot. It was a mountain lion. Did you get him? I will before morning. I couldnt do it. She wants to die, shell have to do it by herself. Ken heard the shot. Howd he take it? Well, he took it. He didnt question it, he didnt seem to rebel. If he wakes up and asks... dont tell him shes still alive. But, Rob-- She may be dead by morning. Wouldnt surprise me. Hes accepted her death. If he knows shes still alive, hell be all upset again. I wont tell him. [Nickers] [Whinny] Thanks, Flicka. [Whinny] Morning, Dad. How do you feel this morning? Much better, thanks. Enough better to go out in the warm sunshine? I guess so. Its doctors orders. Come on. Ill help you get dressed. Dad...where are we going? The calf pasture. Thats right, Son. [Whinny] Flicka. It is Flicka. But I thought-- I didnt shoot her. I couldnt. That shot you heard? That was the mountain lion. I killed him. Ohh. Ohh. Easy, Ken. [Whinny] Flicka. [Whinny] Oh, Flicka. She did get gentle, didnt she, Dad? Gentle as a kitten. Shes given us a lot of trouble, Son... but shes taught us some important things, too. You, responsibility. Me, there is such a thing as hope beyond hope. That sometimes, when things are at their lowest ebb... all we need do is have a little more love... a little more patience, and a little more faith.
