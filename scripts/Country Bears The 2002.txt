The Country Bears|officially broke up after the '91 Hibernation Tour. It's actually hard to imagine|popular music without the Bears. I learned a lot from those guys and that was why I was so sad|to see them break up. I guess I miss the old days at Country Bear Hall. We was Kinda...|different, you see? And, uh, at Country Bear Hall you could be different|and still fit in. Yup. Different. Mm-hmm. Hey, Beary. Doofus, it's time for dinner. Sit down, Dex. Okay, that's enough,|that's enough. NapKin's not a toy, Dex. I'm really not that hungry. Mom? Am I adopted? Well... of course not, honey. Eat your fish. Yes, you are. Um... why would you think that,|Beary? I don't know. Sometimes I feel... different. Like Dex and me. We don't look the same. Our eyes are different colors and he has freckles,|and I don't. I think. Are you serious? That's why you think|you're different? You know, um... Iast week it was "casual Friday"|at the office and I guess I forgot|and I wore a tie. And boy... did I feel different! It was... Yeah. The point is that it's|not unusual to feel different and... those differences|always lead us to our higher purpose. Higher purpose? Honey, even if you were adopted we would love you|as much as we love Dexter. Maybe more. Just remember, son the people who love you|no matter what... that's your family. Okay. I'm going to go practice. Did you know the Bears made|the only country song ever go be recorded in Polish?! Whoa! Really?! And did you know|that nobody cares? Way to go, doofus.

I mean, picked you up, man. You were left alone. They brought you home they showed you a bunch|of Barney videos and they pretended|you were their son. You don't belong here. At Country Bear Hall you could be different|and still fit in. Yup. Different. Sometimes it's just the goin' You've got to go And you don't even know|if it's the right thing to do Nobody else can be showin' Which way to go And you're not even sure|of where you're goin' to But it's a start In your heart Sometimes it's just the goin'... Country Bear Hall! Wow! Whoa! Hey! Uh... 25 cents?! Do you have change|for a hundred? Hello, Reed. I thought|you weren't coming back until you could|tear the place down.

But nobody, but nobody was like|the Country Bears. Huh! Place would be packed--|people sitting everywhere even up in the rafters. You know, sometimes I'd climb|up there just to hear the notes. What notes? The music. The millions of notes|that floated up there... Some of the best|darn notes ever. Well, why don't you stop them before they start|to tear the place down?

That was a long time ago, Kid. Things change. Frankly, your little nostalgic|field trip you know, is Kind of pathetic. Well, maybe it was. Sorry to have bothered you, Ted. People are waiting for me. You found your way in. You can find your way out. Hmm! That guy's turned into a real... I'm going to go get the bus. My mistake, everyone. Don't know what I was thinKing. It's not your fault, Henry.|It's mine. This whole thing was my idea. No, no, now,|it's nobody's fault. But it might as well be mine! Why don't you just...? Tennessee... Right. Come on, Fred. This ain't right. Ba-da-da-da-da Ba-da-da-da-da -It's not unusual|to be loved by anyone|-Huh? Huh? It's not unusual|to have fun with anyone But when I see you|hanging about with anyone It's not unusual|to see me... cry Oh, I want to die. Ba-da-da-da-da... You... you're a wedding singer? Yeah. This... this ain't your party? Nope. So, you're not rich? Yeah. And you still|won't play with us? Nope. I'm not goin'. Aw, Ted,|you don't gotta lie to us. You're family. And you're going. When the Kidnappers call|to make their demands we just agree|with whatever they say. I already told you guys|he hasn't been Kidnapped. He's with the Country Bears. Listen to me, son you can be sure that they're|going to be keeping him in some creepy underground lair high up in the building until|they get their ransom, okay? Would you guys listen to me? There's not going to be|any ransom. He's with the Country Bears. They're doing a concert|tonight... at Country Bear Hall. They just said that to distract|you, sports fan. Besides... the Country Bears back together? Son, listen, leave the police|work to the professionals, okay? Sure. Just... tell me|when they get here. Good Kid. -He's a keeper.|-Yeah. All these years, I haven't been|able to face you guys. I pretty much lost everything. So I been trying to make a buck. Singing at weddings|and stuff like that. Well, at least you're not doing|children's birthday parties. Well, uh, I am. Really? But we saw your house...|your gardener. That's not my gardener.|That's Elton John. Told ya. I rent a room|over the garage from him. Well, now, brother, that's okay|'cause we's all together again. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Just 'cause I'm telling|the truth doesn't mean I'm dumb. Huh? Roadie, stop the bus. Okay, have you rehearsed? What songs you gonna do? Who's doing sound? Well, we ain't exactly|figured all that out yet, Ted. Same old Country Bears. Come on, Ted.|You do Kind of owe us. I mean, you were|the reason we broke up. Well! There it is.|Knew that was coming up. I'm the reason|we stayed together, Zeb. Did any of you-- any of you--|ever thank me? We all had our jobs to do, Ted. Uh-huh. Oh, right. DrinKin'... blubberin', and... starin' into space. -Hey!|-Huh? What we were... was years ago. Blubberin'? Uh, uh... Well, you were blubberin'. Hey? Okay, there. Guys! Hey, hey, guys! Guys! You know, in People magazine,|April 1983 you all said|that the Bears was your family. And like a family... Kid, that's just a bunch|of meaningless publicity. You don't know nothing about|the real Bears, understand? Nothin'! We are not a family. You're right. This isn't a family. 'Cause the people who love you|no matter what? That's your family. Who told you that, Beary? My dad. My dad. Wh... wh... hold on, Beary. Mom? Beary. Beary! Beary, Beary, Beary! Oh!|There's my good boy! Are you all right?|Did they hurt you? Did they brainwash you? How many fingers|am I holding up? I'm fine, Mom. Oh, honey. Norbert! Norbert! Yeah, hon, what is it? Hi, Dad. Oh! Beary! Oh, Beary, Beary my Beary boy! Oh! Hey, doofus. Hey, Dex. Look who's home. Come here! Aw, Beary left his stuff. Hmm... "My Hero," by Beary Barrington,|fourth grade. "My hero is really heroes "and my heroes|are the Country Bears. "Whenever I'm sad "I play one of their songs "and I forget why|I was even sad at all. "And if you'd met my brother you'd know why|I was always sad." Hmm. "I can't really say Zeb|is my hero, or Fred, or Ted or even Tennessee." "But as the Country Bears,|what they can do together makes them my heroes." "I'd like to meet them someday. That would be cool." It says here "A+, but is everything|about the Country Bears? " Hey. Beary's a sharp little guy. This morning he told me|something else. Mr. Chicken... is a girl. It's a pretty straightforward|demolition, Mr. Thimple. Take about a half hour|to bulldoze her to the ground. Oh, yes... do that. Dex, honey,|would you get that? Okay. And tell Beary to come down|for some pie. Beary! Pie! Uh... Beary? Hey. That Ted guy is here. You want me to Kick him out? Ted? Ted Bedderhead is here? Yeah. You, uh, you left your stuff|on the bus. You can keep it. I don't want it. Um, look, I, uh... mm... I hope you know|how lucky you are. It only took you three days|to understand something that took me ten years|to figure out. What's that? Mr. Chicken is a girl. What? I got ya. Really, I want to tell you|that I'm sorry. I was mad-- not at you--|and I'm sorry. And that thing you wrote|in your journal about us being great when we're together? It's true. You're going to do the show? Nah, we're not doing the show. Not without you. Whoo-hoo! Y'all come with me. We can all ride together|on the... -bus?|-Bus? The bus was stolen. It was that Thimple fella. Come on, move along.|Move it. Come on. What are you waiting for? Thimple, I'm definitely|changing banks. Oh, pooh. I hate it|when we lose a customer. We have to find them.

I can't have you ruin what I've been worKing on|for 30 years. 30 years! Which way? Just, uh... go straight. Okay, take a right. Take a right here. -Whoa!|-Whoa! Oh, oh, whoa! Whoa, my Kidneys.

Hey, where you going? To... sit in the audience. Well, that's a weird place|for a Country Bear to sit during a Country Bear concert. Yeah, Beary. You're one of us now. Welcome aboard, Kid. Ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure|to introduce to you-- after an absence of many years-- the one, the only the Country Bears! Ha, ha! Whoo!

You're the bear!|You're the bear! Yay! Yay! There's a town down the road Where I ain't been before Nobody knows my name Or what I'm looKing for Maybe things will be|a little different 'Cause it can't stay the same I'm gonna ease on down the road Where nobody knows my name. 14 platinum records,|26 top ten singles. The Bears to me really typify|rock and roll. Their lives embody freedom. Nobody tells them what to do. Hello. Everybody loves the Bears. The reason I do what I do today|is because of the Bears. I needed a... you know... somebody that I could relate to,|a certain band and the Bears-- they just did it|for me, you know? I admired their, uh, courage. And their tenacity. And their ability to go out and fight|for what they believed in. Real legends.|It's incredible. And I'm glad we didn't get them,|you know, during wintertime. Hmm? The country was cool and all,|but, you know it was becoming the hip-hop|generation, you know. People wanted the beat. The streets was pop.|You know what I mean? Let 'em feel|what the country feel like when it's bangin'. Bow, unh. You know what I'm saying?|Huh. We could do that. I found myself going back and-and sampling some|of the bass lines that the Bears had|and-and then we used it in our first single|and got sued by 'em. It was like nothing|I'd ever heard. Wow! What is this? I have respect for all peoples and all bears. Bears are human beings,|just like us. You understand? I'm an alien. Me and Zeb opened up a can of honey|on the roof of the White House. We had a great time. I'm a honey. They dip honey. I'm a honey dip. You know what I'm saying? It's a honey thing, B. A certain amount of honey,|they... they start to lose focus. It was bad. Bon appetit. They'll eat anything|that isn't locked up. Hey, you want a sandwich? Uh, no thanks. I had trout for breakfast. The Bears made me feel proud|to be a full-figured woman. You want me to eat you,|don't you? These guys were fat Iong before it was spelled|with a "PH." Come on. In you go. I always hated bears. I knew it. You have one. The guys|at the station have one. Oh. Even Mrs. Davis,|our receptionist, has one. You don't have to wear|no fake mustache to impress me. Thank you. You know, I'm Kind of glad|this happened. Well, good. Now, you don't have to wear|no mustache, right? No, I'm wearing the mustache.
