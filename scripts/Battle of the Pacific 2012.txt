On their way, taking control of the island. Under Japanese control Saipan is called home by 20,000 of its citizens. And defended by over 30,000 highly trained members of the Imperial fighting forces. Though one of the most strategically important of the Japanese strongholds in the Pacific Saipan's defenses folded Under the onslaught of the American war machines, numbering over 70,000 strong. In the ensuing battle the majority of the Japanese defenders are annihilated. And the survivors flee to Mount Tapochau. Located at the centre of the island. Taiheiyou no Kiseki ~ Fox to Yobareta Otoko (Miracle in Pacific The man called Fox) Keep your heads down! Down! Medic! Medic! Help! I'll go. Medic! - Ammo! - We're out! Ammo! Medic! Enemy planes! Stay put! It burns! Hey! Naito! Naito! Unbeknownst to the Japanese on the island The Imperial navy suffers a humiliating defeat in the seas off of the Mariana's Leaving the Imperial command no choice but to abandon the defense of Saipan. The uninformed defenders however continued to fight. Believing in the inevitable victory of their hallowed Imperial forces And their nation. Get outta the way! Get a move on! Clear the way! Pull this thing over! C'mon move outta the way! Sorry 'bout that! Captain! Carry on! C'mon! C'mon! Get outta the road! Hey! Clear the way! God damn many Japs! This time tomorrow! The camp's gotten be overflown in no time! Just a few days, those yellow monkeys in the mountains are gonna be history. You know their orders are to stop us no matter what. These Japanese soldiers are tough. They don't give up. You have no idea what you're talking about, Corporal. I advise you to keep your opinions to yourself. Right, sir. Dammit! Watch it! Hey! Take it easy, Corporal! Or I'm taking the jeep and you're walking. You read me?! Yes, sir. Are you alright? Shit... - I should've stopped. - Look. They're just Japs, sir. They'll be fine. Every Japanese knows there's only once in a lifetime to be sincere. What's that mean, sir? The Japanese treasure every meeting for if it may never recur. If you pay attention. You might actually learn something while you're here. Where'd you learn your lingo, sir? You date a Jap girlfriend or something? I studied in Japan for two years. Unfortunately, I never got around having a girlfriend. Bet you wanted to. Keep your eyes on the road mister. Yes, sir. The remaining troops are to evacuate immediately to Mt. Tapochau. Our Imperial Japanese Army... Of the 43rd, division. Under the command of His Excellency Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito. Will prevail til the end. We will hold til the 4th of July. What did the Imperial command say? Victory finally. The enemy will finally see our wrath. Command requires that only the capable and healthy go to Mt. Tapochau. Those unwell are to stand down. That is all! Hold him tight! Hold on! Hurts doesn't it? I understand. Do it! Captain? I do not wish to go to Mt. Tapochau. I would like to stay and perish here. With my unit. Please grant my wish. You're Lewis? Yes, sir. Have a seat, Captain. We're not that formal here. Not in this damn place... Thank you, sir. I hear you speak Japanese. Well, the Japanese would say otherwise. I know the basics, sir. Where're you from? Boston, sir. So you're a Ivy Leaguer, huh? You could say that. I'll try not to hold it against you. I need your help, Lewis. I don't understand these Japs. This ah... Bushido suicide thing... It's ah... Well! It's crazy. Well, It's ah... it's a matter of pride. It's a way of thinking. They've been nurturing in their heads for centuries. What? Killing themselves? Are you.. Are you familiar with these, sir. Can't say that I am. What are they? Some kinda... Jap lucky charms? No, sir. They're shoji pieces. They're Japanese chess pieces if you will. They all look the same except for the writing inside. So? Well... The only thing that differentiates your pieces from mine, is the direction they're facing on the board. Get to the point, Captain. Yes sir. Unlike our chess If I were to take one of your pieces. I don't hold onto it waiting for you to reclaim it. I just simply turn it around. And use it against you. As part of my army. What the hell does that have to do with them killing themselves!? The Japanese put a high price on loyalty to one's master. If one were to be taken prisoner. It would be expected behaviour for them to serve the new lord... With equal loyalty. Now if that were true. Why wouldn't they just surrender and come fight on our side? Well, sir. If they were to be taken prisoner there's a chance they could end up betraying their emperor. So they choose to die. Instead of taking the chance that might happen. You see, sir, the Japanese... Captain! I didn't come here to play fucking chess. Now if these Japs want to die I'll be more than happy to oblige them. Honorably or otherwise. I just want to get this damn war over with. Are we clear? Crystal clear, sir. Sister... She's running a fever. Water. Enemies! Man the machinegun! Quickly! Get up! Attack! There's the entrance! You're up! Frag that cave! Now he throws it in! Merry Christmas! Nips! Hold it! - Cover the entrance! - Got it! Cave's clear! - Are they dead? - Go in and find out? - I'm not going in there. - Get in there! - Go on! - Get in there. Check him out! - Check those pockets! - I don't have all day. Get those souvenirs, watches... What've you got? Got one! - Move out! - Yeah! yeah! - I want a belly band! - What's a belly band? Give it. I have two children of my own. Follow me. We need to stock up on supplies. Don't we have enough? We need to stock up on more. Later we won't have a chance. Naval command's not ready, so continue to hold. We'll wait for the combined fleet to recapture the island. Arrival of the combined fleet won't be long. Who is this? My subordinate. Even without naval support? We are going to fight?! - Insolence! - Quiet! Keep silent. Captain, I will tell the rest tonight. That even without naval support I am not afraid to die. I want to win the war. As do I! No! You just want to die. That's not true. Dying may be necessary. But not unnecessary sacrifice. Death will not ensure our victory! We must kill as many enemies as we can to ensure our army's victory! Bear that in mind! I am addressing the officers and men to the Imperial Army on Saipan. For more than twenty days since the American devils attacked, the officers, men and civilian employees of the Imperial Army and Navy on this island. Have fought well and bravely. I expected... that every man would do his duty. Heaven has not given us a chance. We have fought in unison up to the present time Despite the bitterness of defeat we pledge "seven lives to repay our country". Whether we attack or stay, there is only death. Men who realize the true value of the Empire Utilize this opportunity to exalt true Japanese manhood. Saipan is the breakwater in the Pacific. Leave my bones on Saipan as a bulwark of the Pacific. As in the Senjinkun battle ethics, Never suffer disgrace and will offer up the courage of my soul. For the eternal life of the emperor and the welfare of the country! BANZAI! July 7th, 1944 On the day following the suicide of General Saito and his four commanders The tattered remnants of the Japanese forces Gathered near the western coast of the island for a final assault against the invaders. The Americans however, remained completely unaware of their movements. Keep us posted on a regular basis. If we find anything out there you boys'd be interested in I'll let you know. Come home normal. - Stay sharp. - Roger. - Mikey! Let's go. - Coming, sir. I sure miss those Hawaiian gals. Oh yeah, those girls are sweet. Incoming! - Holy Shit! Japs everywhere! - We got company! Japs! Get to your firearm! Charge! Charge! Here they come! Long live the Empire of Japan! Cover! Cover! Get on the horn! Able Victor Crow. This is Victor Blue. Can you read? Over! Victor Blue. This is Able Victor Crow. Go ahead, over. Look out! This is Victor Crow! We're getting a god damn Jap banzai attack! - We'll be trying to hold them back! - Get the Captain... Get the Captain! Captain! Requesting immediate fire mission on my mark! I say again! 1 stick 4 items! Fire for effect...! C'mon! Get outta here! Victor Blue. Repeat last transmission. Over. Victor Blue. Repeat last transmission. Over. Mike! Get your ass up! We're going in the field! Captain. That's Travis. - I think it's been overrun. - Shit... Find out what's going on now. Banzai...! Banzai...! On the 7th of July. And what came to be known as the Banzai Attack. Over 4,000 Japanese and close to 2,000 American lives were lost in a space of only a few hours. Two days later, the American commanders would declare a total military victory on the island of Saipan. Keep your eyes open! Check em' out! Could be some live ones! So you fear death? Who are you? Speak of the dead. Horiuchi Kesamatsu. Private First Class. Here! Near Mt Tapochau. It's a place the Japanese are calling the Valley of Hell. It was here that General Saito along with his other commanders committed suicide in front of their men. And they did this the night before they launched the attack. The night before?! That's right, sir. The night before the attack. They want to die for their god emperor. Though they just assume, take us with them. They kill themselves... The night before hitting the battlefield. What sense does that make!? Well, by dying this way in front of their men They're showing their men the way. They're setting an example. Continue, Sergeant. Now up here. Marpi Point. Calling these cliffs, the Banzai cliffs. Because apparently civilians are throwing themselves into the rocks in the sea below. Women, children and entire families are killing themselves, sir. Women and children? Why?! Seems that the Japanese military has told them That we Americans are cannibals and torturers. They are terrified, sir. The Japs have lost their commanders. And we've crushed their armies. Now I tell you boys The end is in sight. Thank god for that. Because this must stop right now! You're right Colonel. But I feel we can't be too optimistic about this. This is still a volatile situation. Id like to try and convince them to surrender, sir. You want to talk to them? They have no more food left. With no fresh water on this island, They've also got nothing to lose. I refuse to lose even one more man on that mountain! You've got one month, Captain! After that I'll blow them all to hell. Thank you, sir. Hey! Water! Water! Open Open Where? Live. Captain. Kind as you are. This may expose us to the enemy. The enemy may save this child. And the price for that is our death? You're ridiculous. What are we fighting for? If not for the people. Hey! Whatever the commander wishes. Alright! Let's do this. You! Over the fence! Check the back! What kinda name is Atkelelini? - You don't look Italian. - Check those bodies. Navajo, sir. - Atkelelini - You two over there by the shed! Means "troublemaker". Grandfather rode with Roosevelt and the roughriders in Cuba. Met my grandmother in Cuba. - Now that's trouble. - You two! Go round the back! Exactly. You don't mind if I call you Trouble? Everybody else does. Let's go. Guys hear that? It's probably a trap. I don't think you should go in there, sir. Thank you, Sergeant. Calm down... Oh... I gotcha... He's weak. Let's make sure we get this little guy some help, huh? Yes, sir. - You got him ? - Yeah. He's got your eyes, Sergeant. Here. Make sure not to lose him on the way back to camp. Get him some water. How'd you suggest I do that? You take your thumb, you're gonna dip it in your canteen. And you're gonna let him suck on it, just like you do. Shut up! You want the Japs to hear you? Now spread out and finish clearing the area. Move! And take that damn thing off your head. Bito? Captain? Captain's alive? You guys, alright? With the Captain, we're fine. Stand... Salute! Toshio of 1st Battalion, 18th Regiment. I'm Oba. We're on our way to base camp, through the western slope of Mt Tapochau. We'll use the dense jungle. Even light hardly penetrates. Best for concealment. Look at this! What is it? Here. American devils have been here. Why are we delaying? Ambush. How are we sure they'll cross here? Based on my calculations, they'll probably cross here. And my gut feeling. Alright take five! Anyone got any water? Here. I've got a little. Private, how many times do I have to tell ya About the marvels of water conservation? - Sergeant, it was full this morning. - You're fucking useless! You go without. You get me killed, And I'm coming back and I'm gonna kill you. - You got it? - Yes, Sergeant. Take a load off... Get down. Grenade... Grenade There's another one over here, LT... Sergeant? There's a hidden path over here. Fucking yellow monkeys. How stupid do they think we are... Well. What are you waiting on? Alright. Let's see what this takes us. C'mon. Get. Let's go... Watch your spacing... Quiet... Munroe? I don't like this. Let's get outta here. Everyone fall back! - Attack! - Incoming! - Dammit! It's a trap! - Cover me! Watch out! Fall back! Cease fire! I suppose you're gonna try and tell me the Japs did this on purpose. Well, sir! They just disappeared! Check the wounded! - He's gone, Sergeant. - Get his tags. Was mist also in your calculations? Coincidence. Show yourself! Please hold your fire. Who are you? Kazuo Oshiro. How many people live here? I haven't done a count... Maybe about... We have got supplies of food, Medicine from a hospital. And a nurse's station. News of those in the shelter (Susupe Camp) suffers from hunger and torture. That's why most stay back. Marine Corps, Lieutenant Kinbara. Private Nagata. Sakae Oba of the 18th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army. What's the situation on weapons and ammunition? launchers and 20 rifles. However. We've got 5 American rifles. We're ready to engage the enemy! I'll leave you in charge of the camp. I have utmost trust in your leadership. Do not fail me! Yes! You're in good hands. Captain? Why can't you lead us? Our mission is... to take out as many of the enemy as possible. You're leaving us to die. Why you... Leave her. The plane's headed towards the camp. Back to camp! Yes! Stretcher! Stretcher! Tragedy. hold! Tend to him. Move! I'm sorry. Out of the way! Look at what've you done. Verify the number of surviving civilians and soldiers. Yes! Scout for an alternative. We need another location to accommodate 200 people. Yes! Right now! We have 100 soldiers and 86 civilians. We have already looked for an alternative camp sites. Under the command of Captain Oba. We have 3 locations. slope of Mt Tapochau! - Speed up! It's getting dark! - Yes! Please be aware of your surrounding, and don't let your families wander off. Transition to the camp site will soon be completed. Kazuo? I have come to realize. That the civilians and the soldiers. Are our duty. I understand that now. Oh. Very detailed. I taught geography in school. Are we located here? You understand? I know where the mango is. Very good. You and your sister can map it out. Alright. I'll teach the rest. What's wrong? Hungry... Saying it makes you more hungry. You can't eat a raw snail. You have to boil it first. Those hidden in Mt Tapochau! Japanese soldiers and civilians! We will not harm you! The U.S. army will not harm you! Lay down your arms and surrender! Feels nice. C'mon in! Feels wonderful! Quit moving around. Don't listen to Captain Oba. Why? Because his, command is like a God's. Oba and God are in the same league. You there! Stop it! - Get him out! - Yes! Nothing to see! Disperse! Disperse! God said to me. God loves you too. - Quickly! - Yes! Quiet! Heard he was a Priest. Lost his mind eventually. Captain Oba! Alright. You try. C'mon! You doing it wrong! Relax your shoulders! Tuck your knees in! Thatta girl! Hey! Horiuchi. Didn't I warn you not to approach the camp? Align your sight to the tip. Tuck your knee, Aono. Knees. Knees. Alright! Straighten up! Straighten! Shit! Damn! You really pulled the trigger! That's dangerous! Thank you. I'm grateful for the lesson. Why do you want to learn to shoot? Eh... Your name's Chieko, right? Try not to act like you're one of the soldiers. I used to be a performer. Now without a family. The only thing I want for myself. Aono wants. To kill American soldiers. Captain, how old are your children? Much older. I see... I'm not related to the children. Been looking after them ever since their mother got sick. I'm not worried when you're the guardian. Neither am I. When you are leading. We are grateful for someone such as yourself. Thank you for your effort. How much food do we have left? Don't think about that. Yes! They will return. We need to relocate. Fast! We'll move to the 2nd alternative tonight. What about the food supplies? Move them out separately. Regrettable. Just settle into some normalcy and this happens. Now we have to give it up. How much further? It's here. The base of the mountain that we spotted the camp. Anything from the grasshopper? The last report: There's no signs of life. Japs must've gone up. And over that ridge. What about the other side of the mountain? Can they even make it over the coral ridge? One thing's for certain. They're gonna leave a pretty big trail. Let's hope so. Alright! Munroe. Move out! They must've known we were coming. Hey! Water! Wait! There's no fresh water on this island! - Corpsman! - Captain! Captain, over here! - Get the corpsman over here! - Sergeant! - Sergeant! - Sergeant! Don't move. Oh my god! Alright, you better keep it safe. Captain? Oh, Jesus Christ! How you doing pal? First they... Disappear into the mist? And then he baits us for water? And we don't even know what he looks like? - Sergeant. - He's a fucking fox. Sergeant, take it easy. Save your energy. You take care buddy. Atten hut! Men! I have a problem. And you can bet you fucking me, if I have a problem You now have a problem! I've just received an ass chewing from Washington! The brass is wondering why they've received reports of enemy activities on Saipan!? An island that I assured them that we had secured! Over 4 months ago! Now I would like to report back in the not too distant fucking future! That all enemy hostilities have ceased on this island! Gentlemen we will hunt. And we will destroy any and all opposition on that mountain Within the next 7 days. Further! I'm hearing some kinda nonsense! About a Japanese officer who thinks he's too smart to be caught! A Fox! Sir. Say again? Some of the men say He's smart like a fox, sir. Some of the men say He's smart like a fox, sir. Bullshit! That is complete and utter bullshit! Even if there's a guy up there running the show! I will tell you this! He will be gone. Gone. Gone straight to hell. In under a week. I promise you that. The enemies' area of operation is limited to Around the base of the mountain. These 200 or so Jap soldiers are holed up in this area. And I know I have your assurance that every last one of them will be flushed out. You will make a full division sweep of the whole god damn area. I want a line 3 miles wide and marines at arms length. Forget about the Japs. Anything thats moving or alive I want found. I want those Japs in custody or in the ground. Good luck, gentlemen. Huge lines of Americans outflanking us. The situation will quickly spiral out of control. We need the civilians out of the way. The civilians are hampering us. We need to ensure the civilians are safe! Mt Tapochau's eastern side is endless stretches of cliffs. But there are caves interjecting the cliffs. We will keep the civilians out of harm's way there. Slowly The caves are camouflaged by the jungle's tree line. They will be safe up there. Those searching the jungle will never find them. It's our only way. C'mon. I am sorry. - Slowly. - Mother. What is it? Okuno's not going up. My mother's too old and frail, sir. She's afraid of heights and claustrophobia. She'll be more trouble than help. Fucking... You guys got anything down there? - Nothing here! - Alright! Move out! What about that area at the base of the mountain? Over! - Yeah! Okay... - See anything? See anything up there? Over. Nothing buddy. Don't see a thing. - Keep your eyes up! - Hey, pick it up. They know the land a lot better than we do. - Sis, I'm not feeling well. - A little while longer... I'm uncomfortable. Check your left. Check your right. Coast is clear. - Pick it up... - Let's go... What have you got? - Keep your eyes open. - See anything? - Not a damn thing. Fuck! Incoming! Shit! How many!? - You gotta be... - Here they come! C'mon! Go, go...! - Go, go, go! - He's on me! He's on me! - Keep firing! Shit! - Ambush! Grenade! - That guy's behind that rock! - Move it for the right! Motherfuckers! Down! - To your left! - Move! Move...! Grenade! Let's take a look at how we did. Captain! What have we gained? All those marines at our disposal. We captured six scared civilians! Killed 3 Jap soldiers! And lost 11 U.S. marines! We failed. We underestimated, sir. underestimated? We couldn't even find them for Christ's sake! Who is this Fox character Lewis? What is his fucking name? Is he some kinda magician? Is he Harry Houdini!? He's responsible for the booby traps. And he's probably the one who marked the baby for us to find Colonel. He's a clever man. Clever my ass. What do you think the brass is gonna say? We did shit! That's what they're gonna say. And they'd be right! Get outta my fucking office! Don't hate the military... Iron rice bowl and chopsticks... Unfortunately, not Buddha... For a meal. Really good for nothing... Nothing like some labor work. I am that kinda person. That's right! I'll kill 100 American soldiers. Already killed 31. If I kill 10 everyday. I'll achieve lots in a week! What are you doing? I want to kill them all. Excuse me? I heard you had a woman here that knows about "The Fox". Fox. What fox? All the civilians we brought down from the mountain? They're all civilians here, Captain. Where's the people that came down the mountain? Mountain. Oh Yes! Haruko. - Ms. Haruko. - Captain. Wait! You can't go in there. Haruko? I am Haruko. - Sorry. - It's alright. I would like to inquire about "The Fox"? Fox? The Japanese commander of Mt Tapochau. Is that your commander? He left a red marker for the rescue of a baby. Is he a good commander? I'm not sure if it's the same person? You call him... "The Fox" but we call him Captain Oba. Oba? Oba Sakae, the Commander. Oba Sakae... - Colonel. - Big man. Thank you , sir. I still don't get the Japs, Captain. Captain Sakae Oba. "The Fox" That's his name, Colonel. Is that a fact? Take care, Lewis. Good luck, sir When you get this Oba character You tell him something for me. Yes, sir. What's that sir? You tell him Tell him he's a son of a bitch. Be sure to let him know, sir. Attention! Breezy. Take me to the airfield. Yes, sir. Dismissed! You know the first thing that I did when I found out I was assigned to Saipan. Was to grab that fishing rod. Might never use it but at least I can think about it. Well. I hope the day we can all go fishing will come sooner than later, sir. So do I, Captain. So do I. Atten hut! It's no secret you know more about this place than I do. I would like to hear your thoughts. Tell me what you know. Well, sir. We've been carrying out the directives from the psych warfare boys in an effort to get them to surrender. We've had... some success with individual stragglers but... Not with the larger groups we think that are still hiding out in the mountain. Sit down. And what would you do differently? Well, sir I'd like to continue with this leaflets. But I would like to make some on our own. Tailored specifically to the holdouts on this island. And we have to stop using the word Toku (benefit). The Japanese are very proud people and they would not surrender. I'm aware of that, Captain. Go on. We need to give them a way out without shaming themselves. Perhaps tell them to cease resistance rather than surrender. Alright, Captain. Right now you pursue that course of action. But just know that our time is limited. So keep me in the loop. That's all, dismissed. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Captain? You seem to have an understanding of this culture. What is at the heart of this absolute commitment the Japanese have to no surrender? Are you familiar with this, sir? "Camp Susupe" Internment camp for Japanese civilians. "Assembly Hall" I would like to save the lives of the Japanese people in the mountains. I do not want any more to die. I'll be sending messages dropped by planes. Help me. Please consider? For myself. Due to the invading Americans I have lost friends and family. My two children are dead. We must decline. Captain. I don't want Japan or America To further engage in this unnecessary war. I would like to help. Really. Really help me? Yes. Don't pick it up! That's enemy propaganda! Leave it! What's this? Is it real? Photos of Tokyo. Bito? You were born in Asakusa, right? I'm not sure... But it's near Ginza. Tokyo's a ghost town. Kazuo? Yes. I have seen the photo on the flyers. Know any of the civilians in the shelter (Susupe Camp)? Oba. Akio. C'mon. Two days ago. Leaflets were dropped. The photo on the flyer... Is it real? I had a hand in producing the flyer. This photo is not the only one. There are others. Numerous horrific photos of Japan. It is to make you understand. Cease your operations. This is as good a time as any. We... will not respond to claims in the flyers. Please reconsider, Captain. I heard, There are enough bombs to destroy the whole of Japan. Everyday planes take off from this island. Oba? May I enquire? Up in the mountain. Is there a pair of siblings? Yes. Wonderful! Great. They are my children. Since the war. I haven't seen them. Please take care of them. Oba? Do you have time? Here. Look at him before leaving. Are you living well? Captain. Leave. - Please... - Who was that!? - I don't understand... - What was he doing? Take a look! - I got nothing! - Check the windows! - No one's here. - You got anything? What was Oba doing in the camp? Gathering information and supplies. He was trying to - verify some photo. - And? I told him it was true. He was shocked. Colonel. I think we need to try something more aggressive to get them to surrender. Such as? We should promise them Food and medicine. - When they come we set a trap. - And capture them. - No... no. Absolutely not! That would not be honorable nor very effective. If we do that the others left on the mountain will never surrender. Colonel, treachery here is not the answer. Motoki, I will go up the mountain. Please translate that I will convince the commander to surrender. Mr. Baba says he will go up the mountain. And convince them to come down. Well, Mr. Baba, if a Japanese person like yourself can convince them to down down I'm happy to have you try. Perhaps a little Japanese to Japanese talk will do us all some good. At this point, we have nothing to lose. The Colonel agrees. Thank you. Captain, you have my permission to do whatever you need to do. To bring about a better peaceful resolution. Please make sure Motoki-san here, gets whatever he needs too. Ito? Ito! We're out of medicine and bandages. How do you expect me to work this way? Cool down. We are aware of the lack medical supplies. Don't you understand!? I have no antibiotics to help anyone! People will die! My comrades have died as well! Enough! Both of you. We can get drugs and medicine from the shelter hospital (Susupe Camp). Only I know what is needed. - So let me go with you - For the drugs... I will find a way. - Commander? - Move it! Faster! Walk faster! Move! - Kneel. - This bastard is a Yankee lackey. Baba? Why are you here? I'm here to convince you to surrender. Do you think we're weak!? Stop! The Americans put you up to this? I'm doing this for my children... You're not here to see your children. You're here to sniff out our defenses. I want to save my children! I want to take them safe! Is that wrong!? Shut up! Traitor! You have shamed Imperial Japan! Stop your tears. Your children will never look up to you again. Leave. Oba? If my children are killed I'll never forgive you. Aono, what is it? Where are we going? Gonna show me something? What? I need your help. What is it? Please wait outside. I will call you if he agrees to meet with you. Okay. But if and only if he agrees. I don't want him to think that we're trying to track him. Of course, captain. Don't worry about us. We'll stay outta your way. Thank you. "Medical Supply Room" Quickly... Wait... It's time. Thank you. This will be most helpful. Oba? Would you not reconsider? Enough! We will fight to the last breath. In fact, I have brought the U.S. Captain. Fall back! No. it isn't me. Get back! Get back! Get em' clear! Go...! C'mon! Let's go! Don't shoot! Stop! You don't understand! Don't shoot! - Fire! - Men down! Fire! Fire...! - Captain! - Cover! Help the Captain! - Japs through the fence! - Japs on the left! Get em' ...! Aono! Captain! Fall back! Going into the trees! Cover! Cease fire! Cease fire! Copper? Danny? Get them out of here. - The hell just happened? - Alright! Check these men! - Yes, sir! - I don't know. River's not gonna make it. Somebody's over here! Let's get these guys to the hospital. Captain. You alright? I'm fine. A traitor? What? Traitor's Japanese. Horiuchi's dead. Aono... may still be alive. We must not let the civilians go to the shelters. Don't you understand? They will only be a pawn for the enemy. They'll be killed. Food and medicine are in short supply. We can no longer take care of them. Think of the civilians. Wouldn't it be better for them in the shelter? Captain. Though you are the commander. You are no different from the enemy. I beg to differ. I believe. Japan will once again set foot on this land. And when that time comes. I hope you will Remember Mount Tapochau often. During this time that we have stayed together. And through everything we've endured. These memories will not be in vain. Bring these back with you to Japan! Oshiro? It's been an honour. Truth is. I'm relieved to leave. C'mon. TO OUR GOOD AND LOYAL SUBJECTS: We have ordered our government to communicate to the governments of the United States, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that Our Empire accepts the provisions of their Joint Declaration.
