Their parents were dead. They died in a plane crash. How horrible. That's what happened. Turn around, touch the ground. Kick your boyfriend out of town. Lemonade. Crunchy ice. Sip it once. Sip it twice. You coming back? You want me to? You want to? Hey. How ya doing? Sam take off your coat. I got my report card today. Straight A's? I made a C in art. Have you seen my joke book? Hope it's lost. I'm tired of hearing those jokes. Sam, go feed the cat. Take off your coat. They buried them, or what was left of them, in a hole they dug in the backyard, next to the graves of their dead pets. Their pets were on the plane? No, they died of natural causes. Have to be a pretty big hole. Unless... Unless what? Well. Unless there are only a couple of pieces left like... their heads, or an arm or a leg. You, are disgusting. the one who made it a plane crash. So they're living in the house, A big enormous castle, all by themselves. I thought you said they ran away from home. Let me tell the story, would you? OK. That's what you said. There. My joke book isn't here. Sam, if you wear your coat in the house, it won't keep you warm when you go outside. I know. They hadn't run away yet, because... they couldn't get out of the house. Everything was locked from the outside. All the doors were locked, and the windows... Trapped. Like rats. Held prisoner. By who? A mad scientist. No... ... by the authorities. Why? Because... Because they knew things they weren't supposed to know. Oh, my God. What? They caught her. Finally. Why couldn't they just leave her alone? Because she robbed a bank, dummy? They're saying she was brainwashed. Bullshit. They're the ones who brainwash people. Brainwashed? What does that mean? That means someone makes you think something that you know isn't true. How do they do that? They just keep telling you lies until you believe them. She's in prison now. That's where they put bank robbers. Maybe she'll escape. Take off your shirt. It's cold in here. Wussy. I'll do it. Wait... wait, maybe we should stop. No. What about... I've been taking birth control pills. Where'd you get 'em from? Who cares? I got em. Don't you want to? Well, yeah of course I do. It's gonna hurt. Do it. Shit. Shit. Where are my children? Janie... Hi, Mommy. Hi, sweet angel. What did you do today? I took a test in geography. We had to fill in all the states on the map, and name the state capitols. I knew them all. How did I get such a perfect little girl? Where did you come from? You know where. Where? From you and Daddy. What's the matter Mommy? Oh, nothing. I just, I went to the doctor. I was feeling a little sick. Poor Mommy. I don't think you have a fever. Come here. Ah. Goddamned son of a bitch. Where's Maggie? I don't know. Hi, Sammie. Hi, Mom. Where were you? In the garage. What were you doing? Nothing. You were breathing weren't you? If you were really doing nothing, you'd be dead. You're brainwashed. Are you all right? Course I'm all right. What shall we have for dinner? How about... ... eggs and bacon... and toast Yummy. What's for dinner? I'm making eggs and bacon. That's breakfast, Mom. You missed it. What were you and Ryan doing in the garage? Don't walk away from me. Promise me you won't grow up to be like your sister. I promise. Freedom, get goin' Lots to be learned and lots to be knowin' 'bout  People, gotta reach 'em Sit 'em right down and Freedom, gotta win it Gotta put yourself smack dab in it  Hey tomorrow Hey don't you go away Two nickels in ten cents. And a dime is 20 cents. - And one penny i- - Shut up. I'm counting my money. Well... shut up. You shut up. Shhh... You're brainwashed. If the doors are locked, there has to be another way out. The roof. Too dangerous. It's five stories high. They could jump off the roof into the snow. Snow? Yeah. All right. They climbed onto the top of the roof, and jumped off into the snow. They started to run away, but... But what? A cop saw them jump. And he came after them... They had to think of something quick. I know. Something bold... I know... Something brilliant. I know! What? "Possum." Play dead? It's perfect. Daddy. Hello, sweetheart. How was your day? Fine, how was yours? Well, well not bad. Hello, Donna. Hello, Martin. How are you? How are you? Fine. Mommy went to the doctor. Well, I wasn't feeling well. Oh, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Can I fix you another drink? That'd be nice. Janie, would you like a drink? That would be nice. I lost my joke book. Well, try to remember where you were the last time you had it. But, I can't remember. That's how you find it. There you go, Princess. One soda pop on the rocks. Thanks, Daddy. There's a dent in your car. Did you hit something, or did something hit you? Will the insurance pay for it? Well it helps if you tell them what happened. Maybe someone hit the car while it was parked. That sounds right. Hi, son. Hey, Dad. It's time to wash your hands for dinner. They're not dirty. Ah. It's a good policy to wash them anyway. OK. Dinner is ready. Hello, Christian. Hi, Dad. You been reading? Uh huh. Sam go tell your sister to come to supper. Maggie, dinner. Bacon and eggs. I always liked having bacon and eggs for dinner. Feels kind of special. Like we're getting up early and going somewhere. Yes, we could be eating breakfast in the middle of the night before starting out on a trip. To Tahiti. No, the South Pole. Outerspace. Maggie, where would you choose to go? Anywhere. Well, I saw they caught Patty Hearst. She said she wouldn't let herself be taken alive. She knew if she was dead, everyone would just say she was crazy instead of having to face the truth. The truth is, she's a terrorist. She's a resistance fighter. You have to be occupied to put up a resistance. She is occupied... by the system. The system. Well, there is a system of sorts. A social and political system that exerts a measure of control... You're brainwashed, Dad. - over our our actions... - Dad, you're brainwashed. ... and our thoughts. Sam, you shouldn't say that to someone's face. You say it behind their backs. I need another drink. Let's have a spelling bee. Spelling bee? With all my good spellers? Yeah. Well, OK. Let's see. Janie, can you spell familiar? Familiar. F-A-M-I... - L-I-A-R - Good. Now, Christian. Can you spell sanctuary? What's a sanctuary? It's a special place, a protected place. Like a hiding place... Sanctuary. S-A-N-C-T-U-A-R-Y Right. You see, spelling is a skill. You don't have to know what a word means to be able to spell it. OK, Maggie. How about ... ... Habeas Corpus. That's Latin. Well, it's a legal term. H-A-B-E-U-S C-O-R-P-U-S. Not quite. It's H-A-B-E-A-S. I said it was Latin. It's fair. It's in the English language. Sam, it's your turn. Can you spell soap? Why don't you give Mom a word? Soap. S-O-A-P. Good, Son. I got an A in spelling. Why don't you give Mom a word to spell? Did you get a report card today, Sam? Sam. Yeah. Where is it. Let's see if she can spell. Your mother isn't in the spelling bee. - Why not? - For God's sake, Martin. Do something. Donna, can you spell... Matrimonial? As in "matrimonial law?" I did marry a lawyer, didn't I? Yes. M-A-T-R-I-M-O-N-I-A-L Good. Sammie, give me your report card. He made all A's And one C. I want to see it. All A's. And one C. That's excellent, Sam. It is. Don't you worry about the C. You can probably still get into college. That must be the Knotts. I'll get it. Janie, can you spell damnation? Is that two words? Maggie. Hello. Hey. Come on in. Can I fix you a drink, Clark? Yes, please. I'll have what you're having. Scotch. Nadia, the usual? What else? We were just having a spelling bee. Hello, Cantwell children. Hello, Mrs. Knotts. - A report card? - That's Sam's. Can I look? Don't. He made all A's. Well, you are smart children. I know that. Go upstairs. And don't forget your report card. Sam, stand up. No, act right. Come on. I want you to take these. Go on. Be a good boy. - Well it's nice... - What are we waiting for? ... to be here. I don't know. OK. They all played "possum." The cop walked around, and looked at each one of them very, very closely. But they didn't move, and didn't make a sound. They didn't even breathe. They all laid so quiet and still, that he couldn't detect a single sign of life. I don't think there's cheerleading in the Olympics. - What do you mean - But I wish there was... I wish there was... I would watch the Olympics. How's your drink? Fantastic. Not too strong? Not too strong. Last night was a little strong. Playing "possum" worked? Yeah. When the cop finally believed they were dead, he went off to get help. So, they went to the beach. And jumped in a boat. A sailboat... ... and sailed away. Janie, you're just making more work for me being in here. How am I making more work for you? because I always have to take care of you. You're not taking care of me right now. Yes, I am. So, how are the children? Oh, the children are fine. Wouldn't you say, Donna. Hey have got a joke for us, Janie? I can't remember any. Oh, come on. You can remember at least one, can't you? I need the book. I can only remember a little bit. Oh, just tell us the part you remember. - I bet it will still be funny. - Yeah. OK. So, a man said... No wait. He liked two girls. One named Kate and the other named Edith. One Spade. I can't remember the rest. But at the end, he said, "I want to have my Kate and Edith, too? Kate and Edith, too. That's good. That's great, honey. She just doesn't get it. Children are wonderful. This one is. Come here. Pass. Two of spades. They're so easy to love. They don't ask for anything They just accept what you give them. Why do we we ever grow up? Why can't we stay children forever? Janie, you have homework to do. Children can be selfish, demanding, and cruel. How would you know? I was a child. Three hearts. Janie, come on. Let's get out of here. - Goodnight, Mommy. - Goodnight, Darling. - Goodnight, Janie. - Goodnight, Mrs. Knotts. - Goodnight, honey. - Goodnight. Go on. I'll be up in a few minutes. Where were we? - I bet three hearts. - Goodnight, Princess. Four spades. - Oh, pass. - Pass. Pass. I guess that makes me the dummy. - Here we go. - Not the first time. I think I need another drink. Another drink? I think I'm good, thank you. - Maggie. - Dad. Just because your mother smokes, doesn't mean it's OK for you to smoke. Dad? Yes. What does habeas corpus mean? Ah. Produce the body. A writ of habeas corpus means a prisoner must be brought before the court to determine if they are being legally held. Oh. - Goodnight, Dad. - Goodnight, Maggie. OK, I see how you are. All right, I'll give you that one. Great start, honey. What have you got there. I'm pacing myself. They sailed far out to sea... Are they lost? No. They're going to another country. A country where children don't have to have parents. What's it called? Child Land. Dumb name. You tell it then. Ooo and it's alright and it's comin' on  We got to get right back to where we started from  Sam, have you done your homework? No. Do it now. I'll help you. I don't want to. Don't you want to get all A's again? No, I want to get all C's. I can't remember this part. Big one... big one... Bunny... bunny, bunny. ... and then twirl. Hello. Yes, uh, Just a moment please. Hello. Hi. No, she didn't say anything. I told you, she didn't even notice. Not tonight, we've got company. Who else. No, you shouldn't come over tonight. It's not a good idea. Is that Ryan? Let me talk to him. I have to go. I'll talk to you later. Come on. I just want to say hello. Ryan, sweetheart, it's Donna. How are you? I know you were over here this afternoon. You didn't even come in and say hello to me. Why don't you come on over right now? No, I am sure Maggie wouldn't mind. What is the matter with you? What did Ryan say? - Ouch. - I have to get the knots out. He wanted to come over. He loves you. Ow, you're hurting me. Do you want me to brush your hair or not? No, I'll do it. No... I'll do it. You don't know what love is. Yes I do. It fills you up. It makes you feel happy and full. No, it's the opposite. You know that feeling you get here when you slip on the stairs? For one second, it's like the whole world is a hole you're falling into... That's what love feels like. Like you're falling down a hole inside yourself. Do you love Ryan? No. Sam. Do you have to go to the bathroom? No. Look, listen to this. Listen to this. I'm not going to be the butt of any of your jokes. Play some Bobby Darin. No, no. We're not having any Bobby Darin. There's a couple reasons I like this album. Which album? I like Mr. and Mrs. Knotts. They're idiots. Why are they idiots? Because they come over here every night. Mommy and Daddy like them. Shut up. I can't concentrate while you're talking. Dad could beat Mr. Knotts in an arm wrestling match any day. Mom could beat Mrs. Knotts, too. Shut up. Grown ups don't arm wrestle. You win. They sailed far away from land. Far from everything. And then, one day when the younger girl was fishing... something jerked the line. So hard it pulled her overboard. She held onto the line as the fish dragged her away. And then, the line broke. And the fish swam away. She floated, waiting for the boat to find her. But it didn't come. At night, God pulls the covers up over the earth, and puts it to bed. The world never goes to bed. While one half is asleep, the other half is always awake. But it keeps the light on. That's why you see stars. They're little tiny holes in the blanket... for the light to come through. That's not what the stars are. Space is empty, and the stars are on fire. Nuh uh. Mommy told me when I was a little girl. Mom is a well known liar. She was just telling you a story. No. Another stupid, drunk story. Don't say that. Take it back. You have to take it back. OK. OK. I take it back. I want my Mommy. And just as she was about to drown... she turned around, and there was an island. She lay down on the sand half dead. The next day, she heard voices and saw some natives making a fire on the beach. "She's already half cooked by the sun, so it won't take long," one of them said. And then the Chief's son, who was handsome, said, "She is beautiful. I'd rather not eat her." And then another said, "We have to kill her. She will feed us for a week." Then Takuna said to her, "My tribe is hungry. Help us and I will spare you." Then she reached into her pocket, and pulled out some seeds and said, "I have beans and corn, and tomatoes and apples. We will plant them, and you'll have a garden. and never be hungry again." Hello sweetheart, what are you doing down here? Maggie said I was stupid. Oh. You are not stupid sweetheart. And you can tell Maggie that I said you are smarter than she is. Can I stay here with you, Mommy? Aw, now the little con artist comes out. For five minutes. I won't say anything. No. You have to go back upstairs. We're having a grown up evening. Oh. I found my joke book. I'll tell you a joke. Janie. - There was once a little ... - Janie. ... who was very, very poor. I think you'd better go upstairs now, Janie, like your mother says. Maggie said the stars are on fire. She said God doesn't pull the covers over us at night. The stars are on fire. And God is very busy. She's just very tired. Hey, you tell Maggie that I said to put you to bed. - Now? - Now. - Goodnight, Janie. - Goodnight, Janie. - Goodnight, Janie. - Goodnight, Janie. She's exhausted. Janie. And then, Takuna, kissed her, and the natives danced around her. And Takuna asked her to marry him. And she said, yes. And they went to go live in his tree house. What about the boat? Well, one day a year later, the boat came to the island. A year? What could they be doing for a year? Never mind. There you go. Dance it up. I'm gonna dance with your wife. Don't step on her toes. - I'm not. - She doesn't like that. You guys have whipped cream? Oh gosh, we could whip some up. Janie. Come back inside, Janie. Oh, Sam. No you can't come out here. Wow. Oh, great. Wow. It looks different from up here. We're on a spaceship. We've been traveling the universe. But now, we're going home to our own planet, Megatron. Navigator, where are we? Lost in space, Captain. But I can find our way out of here. We must be tangled up in the blanket. Tie up the prisoner. Don't try to escape. I'll set a course for Megatron. They sailed South by Southeast. Navigating by the stars. Warp factor five. Full speed. Past the Bermuda Triangle. between Africa and South America. It's gonna get rough. One day the sky went dark, and the wind started to blow and the ocean threw the boat around like a ball. - God help us. - Christian, be careful. And right in front of them was a ship, with a hundred sails on it. As the boat drifted closer, they saw pirates, smelly pirates with tattoos and missing teeth. Aliens, aliens. Take 'em out. Take 'em out. The pirates threw a big net down on them and hoisted them up over the deck. Then Red Beard, the captain, said, "Ah. I spy a young man. A fancy pants. We'll have to get rid of him." So they put him on the plank, and all the pirates were yelling, "Walk the plank, walk the plank." So he walks out onto the edge, and looks down onto the ocean. Captain, it's a meteor. The steering mechanism... It's jammed. And does a triple back flip with a half twist. - Christian - ...into the ocean. - Ah. - Christian. Christian. Not even a splash. Hold on Christian, I'm coming. Is someone hurt? Oh, the kids just wanted to play , um emergency room, so I was just getting some stuff. Well, don't let anyone get hurt. I won't. Maggie, remember when you won the sixth grade spelling bee? We worked on it every night, learning all those words. What was that word? The winning word. I don't remember. Uh, it's... uh... "Icthyophagous" I-C-H-T-H-Y-O P-H-A-G-O-U-S Fish-eating. Goodnight, Dad. Maggie. Is there... Do you need help with anything? Any problems... I could help you with? I can handle it. I was just trying to scare you. You scared me. Me too. I thought I was falling off, too. It's OK Sammie. Don't cry. Yeah, I'm fine, see. I thought I was falling off the roof with you. Who wants ice cream? OK. I got a joke. So this guy, this oil tycoon, California on a big old plane, and he gets there and he checks into this big old hotel. He wants a drink, so he goes to the bar and there's this pretty little lady at the other end. So, he goes and chats with her and they start putting down double drinks, rounds and rounds. - And they get hungry, right? - Yeah So, they go to the restaurant of the hotel, and they order the biggest steaks on the menu and this big huge flaming fancy French dessert. "Ma'am would you like to go up to my room? It is the biggest suite in the whole hotel. She says, "Yeah." And so they go up there, and start fooling around. And he takes off this big old cowboy hat. He takes off his big old cowboy boots. And he unbuckles his big old cowboy belt buckle. And he drops his pants. And he says, "Ma'am, I'm just gonna have to warn you, I'm from Fort Worth Texas and I am big. And he takes off his underwear and he shows her what he's talking about. Then he spreads her legs open, and he thrusts himself inside her. And he stops. And he looks down. He looks back up at her in amazement. He says, "Golly ma'am. What part of Texas are you from?" That is so funny. Get it? What part of Texas are you from? What part of Texas are you from, ma'am? Big man. Jesus, Donna. Come on, it's not that big. It's more like the Rio Grande. Stop. Stop. - You know what I'm saying... Oh, Martin. Don't look at me like that. God. We're all grown ups here, right? Oh, Nadia, what? You didn't know? Did you know? You didn't bother to hide it. Did you? Now we all know. You could have had the decency... - The decency to lie? - The decency... The decency to pretend The decency not to bring it into this house. This is my home. I will bring my life, all of it, into my home. I am going to get another drink. Maggie? They sailed to the bottom of the world. It was cold. It was freezing. And the boat ran into an iceberg and got stuck. So, they got out to push it. And all the other kids jumped back on the boat. But a little boy was standing on the iceberg, and it was floating away from the boat. And then he couldn't even see the boat anymore, because there was a blizzard and giant snowmen all around him. at him with white eyes. Shit. - Goddamn it. - Mom. What's wrong? I'm sick. You're sick to your stomach? I'm just sick. Sick of everything. Hand me my drink. You should take it easy on that stuff. I'll take that under advisement. I just. I think... I don't care what you think about it. You don't care what I think about anything. You hate me. I don't hate you, Maggie. You can't hate your own child. It's too much a part of you. It's too much like you. I don't want to be like you. Am I really that bad? No, I just want to be different. Who I want to be. Don't get your hopes up. Is that why you're fooling around with Mr. Knotts? I saw you. Whatever you think you saw... Are you fucking him, too? Feel better now? No, now I need another drink. Sorry, that's not funny. No, you're a riot, Mom. We all think so. Me and Christian, and Janie, and Sam. This isn't about you. You try to make everything about you. But, this is my life. This is about me. Truth or consequences? What's consequences? Just say truth. No one wants consequences. Truth. OK. What's the worst thing you've ever done? I wet the bed when I stayed at Aunt Jean's house. That's not a bad thing, that's an accident. Maggie. We're sleeping up here tonight. Why? Because I said so. OK, Bossy. I brought Ted. I can't sleep. Me neither. Me neither. I guess no one can sleep tonight. Tell us a story. You tell me a story. You start. Once upon a time in a country far away, there were four children who ran away from home. Without their parents? They didn't have any parents. They sailed far out to sea, past the last known country, into uncharted waters, where no adult had ever been. Until they reached their destination: Child Land This would make a good novel. One I'd like to read. Everywhere there were pizza shops, and bakeries, and bowling alleys, and swimming pools. You seem to be enjoying yourself. What's wrong with that? Then she started noticing there were lots of 16 year olds, but no 17 year olds. Finally, a kid told her, "They get too old for Child Land, so we put them to sleep." Otherwise they would become grown ups and take over the country. You cannot just do whatever you please. Watch me. Well, I guess we're in this together, aren't we? So she went underground, and joined the resistance movement that was trying to save the lives of teenagers in captivity. But the other kids wanted to find her She sent them a message... ...in code. Every number stood for a different letter. The message said... Maggie. I want you to come downstairs. I'll be back soon. Go to sleep. Maggie. Don't do this. Maggie, your mother is trying to destroy this family. Please, Martin. Leave her out of it. I want her to see how much she's hurting you. You want to be a family, don't you? You want a mother? Martin, it's too late for all of this. It's not too late. We are still a family. Tell her, Maggie. Tell her. Tell him. You tell him. It's your baby. I'm gonna be father. Dad. No. You son of a bitch. Please stop. Stop it. We have to finish the story. They had to escape, all of them. And get to the boat. OK. She sent them a message in code. The message said she would come and visit them in the middle of the night. But she couldn't stay. But, as she slipped off into the night, she dropped scraps of cloth Bits and pieces she tore from her clothes. and left a trail for the kids to follow. It led them to the edge of a deep hole so deep they couldn't see the bottom. They fell and fell, and just when they thought they would never stop falling... ... they landed... ... at the entrance to a secret tunnel. And they could hear the sound of the ocean. So, they ran though the tunnel... ... and got to the boat. ... and pushed off from the dock. And sailed away... And they lived happily ever after. When this old world starts getting me down  And people are just too much  For me to face I climb way up to the top of the stairs  And all my cares just drift  Right into space On the roof it's peaceful as can be  And there the world below Can't bother me When I come home feeling tired and beat  I go up where the air Is fresh and sweet I get away from the hustling crowd  And all that rat-race noise  Down in the street On the roof the only place I know  Where you just have to wish  To make it so At night the stars put on a show for free  And darlin' you can share it  All with me Right smack dab in the middle of town  I found a paradise That's trouble proof And if this world starts getting you down  There's room enough for two  Up on the roof Up on the roof Everything is all right Up on the roof Everything is all right
