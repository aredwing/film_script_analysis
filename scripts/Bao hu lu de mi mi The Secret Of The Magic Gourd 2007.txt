WeII, Raymond's mom was Ieaving, so he said that he wouId study on his own. Miss Lee, Raymond aIways hates doing his math. -He says the numbers make him dizzy. -Raymond reaIIy Iikes fishing. But I don't think I've ever seen him catch anything. (LAUGHING ) Okay, cIass. You are aII very smart, Raymond incIuded. And I think you can each see what happens when you don't study Iike you shouId. Isn't that right, Raymond? Mmm-hmm. We can aII Iearn something here, and that is that when you work hard, better is your IeveI of satisfaction. It's a fact. You sow, you reap. Okay, now, when it comes to good grades in schooI, you have to study. -WiII you promise? -ALL: Yes. -BO Y 1 : I wonder what I got. -BO Y 2: Hey, I can't see. BO Y 3: I got five stars!

I'II turn things around. SOPHIE: So, can the Magic Gourd give me anything I want? NANA: Of course he can. Can he give me one of those doIIies that goes, ''Wah, wah!'' (LAUGHING ) AbsoIuteIy. You can ask for 1 OO doIIies and you wouId get every one of them. There's no way! NANA: That's the story. Hey, Raymond, Nana's teIIing the story about the Magic Gourd. Oh, that ''aII wishes come true'' chiIdren's story again? I've heard it a miIIion times. What's the matter? You aIways used to Iove that story. It's aII just make-beIieve. What's there to Iove? Don't Iisten, Sophie, the Magic Gourd has magicaI powers. He can carry you high up to the sky, right up to the cIouds, where they feeI just Iike cotton candy. Stick out your tongue and they taste Iike cotton candy. That's the power of the Magic Gourd. If you become the Gourd's master, he can grant you anything you wish for. Say you can't finish your homework, or maybe you want to pIay better in sports, whatever it is, the Magic Gourd can come to your rescue.

And what's the prize? I'II give you a hint. Let's just say it has something to do with heIping you. -Why wouId you want to heIp me? -Because you hate work so much. And since you don't want to Iift a finger, I can do aII the work for you. Anything you think of. My speciaI magic Iets me grant anything you couId ever wish. So, you want me to beIieve that I can have whatever I ask for? You're catching on! With my heIp, you'II be the Iuckiest kid on the pIanet, hands down. So, what do you say? Want to have a go at it? Hmm. Hmm! -What? -I want fish. Oh, that's it? Fish? -That's too easy. -Yeah? -Faker. -What? Hey, where are you going? Can't hurry magic. Hey, hey! Wait a minute! We haven't even made the deaI officiaI yet. Huh? What deaI? BAILE Y: Bah! Come back. -What are you taIking about? -Huh? Okay. Here's the deaI. If you want to keep me, then you got to keep a IittIe secret. You have to promise not to teII anyone about me. You're the onIy one who can know about my amazing magic powers. After aII, if word got out that I exist, I'd be Iike putty in their hands and there's not enough to go around. But keep our secret and I am yours. And if you can't, I'II have to Iook for another master. Wait! No, I'II definiteIy keep it a secret. -Promise? -Promise. AII right! So, from now on, you are officiaIIy my one and onIy master. Now, time for magic. The deaI is done. Aha! I cast my speII just for fun. GoIdfish and carp with taiIs and fins, I bring from the depths to fIy Iike wind. RAYMOND: Wow! BAILE Y: So, stiII think I'm a faker? It's pretty cooI, huh? Ever seen anything Iike this? Okay, combo seafood pIatter number three is made to order. (LAUGHS ) -Pick one. -I'II take this. Okay. -Uh, and this one. -Sure. Hey, that one's cooI. Eh, no probIem. You can have any fish you Iike. (LAUGHS ) That's so cooI. (GRUNTS ) Let me take a Iook in that bucket. (GRUNTS ) -BaiIey, wiII these fish... -Say no more. I'm way ahead of you on this one, paI. ActuaIIy, I heard your stomach going, ''Whoop, boing!'' Just a IittIe bit of magic. Whoa, NeIIy! Hot dogs, burgers, cakes and pies, crackers, ice cream, corn and fries. Wow! -This is so awesome. -Now, Iine up to be eaten. Wow, fries! (GRUNTS ) Mmm! Hey, corn. What's popping, man? Try it, try it, try it. (BAILE Y CHUCKLES ) Mmm! Master, think about it. You'II never go hungry again. And it's free. That's the best part. No biII to pay. Hmm? (LAUGHS ) Don't forget to save some room for ramen. (LAUGHING ) No MSG. Enjoy! Look at that. You eat Iike a pig. (RAYMOND BURPS ) (GROANS ) RAYMOND: I'm gonna pop. (BAILE Y YAWNS ) -RAYMOND: BaiIey? -Hmm? RAYMOND: You know, I've never been on a pIane. BAILE Y: Ah? I've aIways wondered what it feeIs Iike to fIy. Oh, it's great. Wait a minute. -You say you want to fIy. Ha ha! -Hey, where are you going? (GRUNTS ) Master, over here. You've got to check this out. -Whoa!

BAILE Y: Okay, Tower, we are cIear for takeoff. HoId on, Master. Here we go! (BAILE Y LAUGHING ) BA/LE Y ON /N TERCO M: Uh, passengers, we have reached a cru/s/ng alt/tude of 300 feet. For your safety, please rema/n seated at all t/mes. There seems to be some turbulence up ahead. Hey, look here. / can save some fuel. We'II get in this formation. RAYMOND: What did you say? We're going on vacation? Ah! Not vacation. Formation. (GEESE HONKING ) -Hey, BaiIey. -What? Can I show these fish to my friends at schooI? I know they'II think they're awesome. Just say the word. Here goes. We're on our way. BAILE Y: Hang on, Master. This couId get a bit bumpy. (TIRES SCREECHING ) Huh? Where is everyone? (GRUNTS ) Guess who? And if you're wrong, I get a quarter. Sean, knock it off. (BOTH GIGGLING ) SEAN: Whoa! Did you catch aII of those? -Yep. -Wow! Where did you catch fish that Iook Iike that? At this Iake I found. Whoa, that's weird. Finding goIdfish in a Iake. RAYMOND: I know. -Hey, guys, what you doing? -Hey, Dan, you got to see this. -Raymond caught these reaIIy cooI fish. -Yeah? Let me see. Forget about it. They're nothing very speciaI. Just some dumb oId fish. -I caught them at... -GoIdfish? Raymond, that's pretty amazing. Do you even know anything about goIdfish? Not reaIIy. DAN: WeII, they are geneticaIIy mutated from crucian carp, but onIy carp can be found in a Iake, not actuaI goIdfish. How come the carp just don't mutate into goIdfish by themseIves? I mean, what if over time, the carp just started getting aII coIorfuI and stuff? That's ridicuIous. That couId never happen. Raymond. Raymond. -Raymond! -Huh? (STAMMERING ) It's pretty Iate. You want to pIay at the park? -SEAN: We're not done here. -Yeah, the park can wait. We need to get this fish story right. 'Cause you never know, you couId have found the discovery of the century. DAN: Hey, we shouId ask Miss Lee. Miss Lee! Miss Lee! -Miss Lee. -Hi, boys, you stiII here? Miss Lee, you've got to see this, Raymond caught goIdfish when he was fishing. ReaIIy? Wow, how beautifuI. Miss Lee, Raymond said that he caught these fish in the Iake. But how can goIdfish Iike these Iive in a Iake? I've seen fish Iike this at the store, but never in a Iake. (LAUGHING ) Now, boys, Iike any probIem you have, you have to Iook for the soIution. And if you Iook in just the right area, you'II find the answer. Look in the right area? Hey, I got it. Tomorrow we can go to the Iibrary. (MISS LEE LAUGHS ) RAYMOND: Okay? Oh, can't forget my fish. (RAYMOND GRUNTING ) WeII, see you. -Hey, BaiIey. -Huh? Why did you embarrass me with the fish Iike that? WeII, I just conjured up the fish, you were the one who wanted them to be goId. (BAILE Y GRUNTS ) (EX CLAIMING ) Just Iook at these fish. (BAILE Y SIGHS ) Now what am I going to do? I don't see what the big deaI is. AII I see are some sIimy, smeIIy fish. Who reaIIy cares about where they came from? Some fish Iive in a Iake, others in a store. Big deaI. And those nosy friends from your cIass, especiaIIy that guy Dan, what's his probIem? He thinks he's Iike a detective or something. Might as weII give that kid a shoveI to dig for cIues with. -Raymond? -Huh? (BAILE Y EX CLAIMS ) -Who are you taIking to? -No one. -What is that? -There's nothing down there. Stop! -RAYMOND: Sophie! -Whoa! -RAYMOND: Come on, Sophie! -Hey, Iook! I see it. There it is. RAYMOND: Sophie, stop! Come on, knock it off. (BAILE Y EX CLAIMING ) (PANTING ) SOPHIE: Hey, Iook, don't run away. RAYMOND: It's nothing. Cut it out. Listen to me, Sophie. You need to stop right now. No! Get away from me. SOPHIE: (GRUNTING ) I've got it. I got it. What are you doing? Get out from under there, Sophie. Grandma, there's something under the bed. WeII, it's time for your bath and your brother has to finish his homework. SOPHIE: But there's reaIIy something under his bed. I saw it. I was chasing it and aImost caught it. Oh, weII, I'm sure you did. But for now, you need to get in the tub. BaiIey, where are you? BaiIey. Hmm? (SIGHS ) (BAILE Y SNORING ) (RAYMOND SIGHS ) (SNORING ) (SLEEPILY) Oh, it's exhausting being chased around Iike some toy. (GROANS ) Sisters are too much work. Hannah, where's that book on marine Iife? I think the one you want was just brought back today. -Here it is. -Let me have it. Hey! No way, Freddy Lo Min's aIready reserved this book, so you're just going to have to wait. Oh, pIease, I reaIIy need it now. -Freddy. -Hi, Hannah. Here's that marine bioIogy book you wanted. Thanks. Yeah, I knew you'd heIp. I'd do anything for you, Freddy. I'm sick. I can't take this. Huh! ''I'd do anything for Freddy.'' It's gross. FREDD Y: WeII, I gotta go, Hannah. See you Iater. FREDD Y: Wait, where's my book? HANNAH: What do you mean? -Hannah, I don't think you gave it to me. -Yes, I did. FREDD Y: WeII, then, why don't I have it? HANNAH: Are you caIIing me a Iiar? FREDD Y: But why isn't it here? GIRL: Didn't you just have it? I don't see it anywhere. FREDD Y: What do you think happened to it? BO Y: Let's caII security. GIRL: It's nowhere. FREDD Y: Where is it? BO Y: It's not here. (GASPING ) HANNAH: I know I gave it to you. GIRL: Did someone steaI it? HANNAH: Where is it? FREDD Y: Hey, Hannah, why don't you take another Iook? HANNAH: I've Iooked everywhere. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. (LAUGHS ) Sean, you dummy. You scared me to death. Come on, Ray, you're up next for the chess game. You got to hurry. Okay, but don't sneak up on me Iike that. WeII, we're going to Iose if you don't hurry up. Just hoId on a second. SEAN: Hey, where are you going? (SIGHS ) (GRUNTS ) RAYMOND: (SOFTLY) BaiIey, how couId you have done that to me? What? Didn't you want the book? No. You made me Iook Iike a thief. Now make it go away. By itseIf? But it doesn't have Iegs. ShouId I make it fIy away? I don't care. (SIGHS ) SEAN: Raymond, what are you doing? Okay. (GRUNTING ) FIy! (CHUCKLES ) FIy, be free, book. BO Y 1 : WeII, here he is.

Not your Iucky day. Hey, Raymond, you can take his knight, right there. -Oh, I wiII eat your knight for Iunch. -He wants Iunch? Whatever you want, Master. (EX CLAIMING ) Hey, where's my knight? What happened to it? Where's my knight? (LAUGHING ) (GROANING ) Hey, you can take the rook. (GROANS ) Huh? Take it. Come on, take it. Oh, so you want a second heIping? What? Raymond?

Check it out. (MOANING ) SEAN: Raymond? BO Y: Raymond... SEAN: Where are you going? BO YS: Raymond. Raymond. (GROANING ) Master, wait, you haven't finished the rest of your Iunch. Whoa! (RETCHING ) (COUGHING ) (PANTING ) I'm out of shape. Did you enjoy your Iunch? Are you crazy? You can't eat chess pieces. Oh? I thought they Iooked tasteIess. But you said you wanted to eat them for Iunch. (WHIRRING ) (GROANS ) Huh? RAYMOND: Hey, why is that book fIying around? That's the one from the Iibrary. BAILE Y: WeII, you toId me it couId fIy away, remember? (BAILE Y PANTING ) BAILE Y: Hey, book, you're going the wrong way. You were supposed to go to the Iibrary, not down here. BaiIey, go catch it quick. You got it. (WHIRRING ) COACH: AII right, Iet's go. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. (GROANING ) Raymond, you can swim.

Good for you, Raymond. I'm very proud of you. Now come on, time for dinner, okay? SOPHIE: What are we having? NANA: Raymond, swimmers need energy. Eat more. They're right, we can't buiId this design. If you say so. But, Master, aII you got to do is ask. AIIow me. With four penciIs, I'm Iike a pre-programmed penciI processor. I do aII the work so you don't have to. No batteries required. (EX CLAIMS ) Whoa! So, what do you think? Is that Iike what you had in mind? RAYMOND: But this design is even more compIicated than mine was. There's no way our team can buiId this. They Iaughed at my pIans. They'II hate me for these. Hmm, I see. Amateurs. WeII, here's another idea. (SQUEAKING ) BaiIey's magic power Iurks. Master wants a pIan that works. Yes, my magic can heIp a Iot. Ha! Now you've got your own robot. Oh, no! You pressed the Iaser button. (LASERS ZAPPING ) Whoa! Whoa! (PHONE RINGING ) Stop! Quiet, it's Mom.

WeII, define what you mean by ''chaIIenge.'' Like, chess or doing things Iike that robot. I see, you do aII the fun stuff. And I take care of aII the hard stuff. Is that your preference, Master? Wait, are you teasing me? No. No, no, no! I wouIdn't dare tease you. Why, working hard is what I do. I do aII the work and you pIay. That's just the way it works. (ROBOT WHIRRING ) Sure Iooks good. Raymond, you better just back away sIowIy. (RAYMOND CLEARS THROAT) Ah! Whoa, Raymond! What is that? BO Y 1 : Wow! Look at that! BO Y 2: It's so cooI. BO Y 1 : No way! BO Y 3: Whoa!

GIRL 2: Oh, that's too bad. Look out. (CHILDREN WHISPERING ) I'm sorry. Hey, why did you make me such a junky robot? I used aII the Iatest tech. It reaIIy shouIdn't have broken. Then you can fix it for me. You aIways make me Iook Iike a fooI. But you're the one who came up with that design. I'm just here to do whatever pops in that brain of yours, see? Next time, make it more durabIe. Okay. (GASPS ) Oh, Iook, it's a toy store. Oh, you Iove toys. RAYMOND: Whoa! Hey, maybe they have a robot in here. BAILE Y: Oh, I'm sure they've got something. Wow, radio-controIIed copters. -Whoa! Check out these robots. -You see one that you Iike? -I Iike aII of them. -Oh, yeah? Whoa! Hmm? Dan Chow? What... What do you want? I don't want anything. I just saw you waIk into the store. I was coming home from schooI and saw you go in here. Listen, Raymond, I thought that was a pretty neat trick, the one from cIass. -What are you taIking about? -You can stop goofing around now. I'm pretty sure I saw that in the cataIogue. Are they stiII avaiIabIe? I might want to buy one. -Forget this, I'm going to a movie. -Oh, come on. Stop pretending. I know you didn't buiId that thing yourseIf. It wouId be impossibIe. BAILE Y: Whew! Okay, weII, if Master Iikes aII the toys, then... Oh, BaiIey's magic never stops. With toys that bounce and even fancy ones with different props. Get ready to march, get ready to run. Time for Master to have some fun. Move out. Hey, mister, where are aII your toys? What? Where are my toys? Hey! Huh? Hey! Hey, pIease come back here. Don't go. (GRUNTING ) Come back! Hey, come back! (EX CLAIMING ) Oh, no! The Swamp D/no Str/kes Back. RAYMOND: AII fuII? Sorry, Dan, but I'm going to see this show. -But you... -And there are no seats Ieft.

Raymond, do you have any idea what you've done? Cheating is aIways wrong. You understand? You must work hard for what's important. It's onIy right. Mmm-hmm. MISS LEE: You know, there wiII be consequences for your actions. But I hope this teaches you a vaIuabIe Iesson. You have a chance to become a better friend and a better student, aII right? Out there you've got some reaIIy great friends. So, pIease, don't Iet them down again. You promise? Mmm. (SNIFFLING ) -SUSIE: Hey, Raymond. -Raymond. Susie, I'm reaIIy sorry. It's aII right. I can heIp you with your math. We can aII heIp. Master doesn't want me. Now he says he just wants to do everything by himseIf. (CROAKING ) I know. The swimming championship is reaIIy, reaIIy important to him. I can't Iet him disappoint his friends. Or his parents. It's my job to heIp him win. What have I aIways toId you? If you do your homework and study hard aII the time, you'd be the best student in cIass. And Iook now. It's not aII bad. Raymond has reaIIy gotten so much better IateIy. He's aIways getting up on his own, and he's been cIeaning his room much more. And he's even cIipping his own naiIs. I have to think that maybe we've been too busy. We haven't been around to heIp. I'd say Ray has Iearned his Iesson for sure. So, I'II just ask you not to do it again, okay? Wow, Master's working hard. He's trained for aImost a month now. (CROAKS ) He must be getting fast. ANNO UNCER: And up next, the 400-meter relay race. (WHISTLE BLOWS ) Sw/mmers, to your lanes. On your mark. Ready. (FIRES ) ALL: (CHANTING ) Tigers! Tigers! Tigers! Tigers! Tigers! Tigers!

I reaIIy want to teII you this! We won the goId! Master, did you say what I think you said? BaiIey? Did you hear me? (FROG CROAKING ) WeII, I think so. To be sure, say it again, okay? You weren't at the meet? So, you reaIIy don't know what happened? No, I wasn't there. So, then if you weren't there, that's not how we won. No, I didn't heIp. You must have done it on your own. I reaIIy did it aIone? I guess so. How eIse? You won it without any of my heIp. Yeah! AII right! Yes! Oh, yeah! Yes! Yeah! Master. Master. You reaIIy don't need me anymore. I think it's time for me to move on. (CROAKS ) Where wiII you go? BAILE Y: Wherever. It's pretty obvious that winning on your own is much more satisfying. It must feeI good to win Iike that. You know, doing it aII by yourseIf. I'm beginning to understand. Granting you everything you couId ever wish for is not the wisest thing. It onIy seems to hurt you. And those around you. Master, I think it's time we said goodbye. One Iast thing. Master, wouId you mind keeping our IittIe secret? BaiIey! Take care! (FROG CROAKING ) Master, take care. (WHISPERS ) BaiIey. Oh, and, Master, don't forget to cIip your naiIs! SUSIE: So, Raymond, what is pi? RAYMOND: It's 3.1 6. No, 3.1 5. Okay. Ah, it's 3.1 41 59. Got it. FinaIIy! But not aIways, I aIso Iike to eat it. SUSIE: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. RAYMOND: Ha, ha. So, where are we going here? And what's aII this? There's, Iike, birdseed in my script. Come on, turn around. We got to go and heIp some other poor kid.
