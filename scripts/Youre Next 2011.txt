Do they show the movies underground? TARIQ: No, no. They show them aboveground, but they... They show intellectual films. DRAKE: So like an intellectual film festival? Do you do commercials? Because those are my favorite, AIMEE: No, he doesn't do commercials. Mm-mm. No. Really? I just think that is just the height of the art form these days. It is just short and punchy, you really gotta just Zing the ideas on in there. That's why I watch TV. I just think it's so... it's better than the shows now. He makes documentaries, so... it's different. Yeah, but I think that I've seen documentary commercials. I don't think they have to be limited to any particular thing. It's not a...

I grew up on a survivalist compound. I haven't even told Crispian that yet. Good answer. Well, I guess when I was born, my dad got kind of paranoid. He was convinced that the world was gonna run out of resources in a matter of years. Found a lot of guys who agreed with him, and we all moved to the Outback. Basically, if things got too overpopulated, even out there, he wanted me to be able to take care of myself. Moved to the States with Mom when I was 15 but I learned a lot beforehand. Wow. That's crazy. Got some things here. So nobody knows where Crispian is? No, he... He ran out right after Kelly did. All right. I gotta go look for them. I at least have to try.

(SIGHS) You never want to do anything interesting. I don't think that's a fair criticism. Fuck me next to your dead mom, then. This conversation is over. () Hm. MAN: Oh! Fuck. Unh! (GROANING) Whoa, whoa, wait! Don't do that! You don't want your DNA in here, man. I'll clean it up later. Just like the rest of this fucking mess. Excuse me? You say that like it's my fault. Listen. Just so we're perfectly clear. I just had to kill my own brother because you guys keep getting beat up by some girl! I had to stab my brother, more than once! You were supposed to do that. For all the good you guys did in here, you could have stayed outside with your fucking crossbows! You wanna talk about brothers? That's my brother, laying dead right there. And unlike you, I liked my brother. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know that. I mean, I knew you guys served together. I didn't know you were related, though. Man, she really fucked him up good, huh? () I'm just trying to think of reasons why I shouldn't kill you! I'll... I'll pay you more. What's that? You kill me, you get nothing. You pull this off, I'll give you 400,000. Okay? I was supposed to give you 2, right? But you should have your brother's share. That's only fair. Plus, I'M throw in an extra 100. Each. If we can finish this. Okay? That's half a million for you. And 300,000 for you. I'm looking at, uh... (FELIX GRUNTING) I won't... I won't be able to pay you until my inheritance comes through but I'll have it soon. We just need to finish this! We did make it this far, man. You two better be getting enough money to pay us! Would I be doing this if I wasn't? (CELL PHONE RINGING) I got it. (FOOTSTEPS) () (GRUNTS THEN COUGHING) Get up! Get after her! Get after her! (GRUNTING) (CLATTERING) (GRUNTING) () () Hell, the cops could be driving here right now, for all we know. What it they come across her down the road? Did you even think about that? You need to calm down. Don't fucking tell me to calm down, Tom. This entire situation is out of control. We don't even know what's going on. She's hurt. She's not faster than us. You stick to the road. You don't see her, you come back here. Well, where are you going? Back to the house to check on Craig and to make sure she's not doubling back. Wait, give us the crossbow. Look, you got your machete. We don't have any weapons. What are you standing there for? Give it to me! (LAUGHS) You know how to use that thing? I know how to fucking use it. I pull the trigger, arrow shoots, right? Two bolts. Two shots. You see her, you make it count. Of course. (GLASS CRUNCHING) Shit. () (BULB SHATTERS) () (CLICKING) (CUCKING CONTINUES) (GROANING) (ERIN GRUNTING) (PANTING) () FELIX: What the fuck? I fucking hit her, didn't I? Get in there. Give me the crossbow. Come on! All right. I'm right behind you. Okay. Goddamn it. () (BOTH GRUNTING) Fuck! It's not even hot, you dumb bitch. Whoa! (YELLS) (ZEE SHRIEKS) (YELLS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) (COUGHING) (YELLING) (YELLS) (WHEEZES THEN COUGHS) (BLENDER WHIRRING) (SCREAMING) (YELLING) (COUGHING) (ZEE PANTING) (ZEE SCREAMS) () (SHUDDERING) (PANTING) (CELL PHONE PLAYING RINGTONE) (KEYPAD BEEPS) MAN: (OVER PHONE) Felix? Hey. Felix, is it all done in there or what? I saw my signal came back. Is it over? Look, I know you're pissed at me for not helping out. I just... I couldn't do it, man. I... I told you this might happen. (CRISPIAN SIGHS OVER PHONE) I saw Mom, and the blood, and you know I'm a pacifist. I can't... I can't deal with the violent stuff. Come on, now. I can hear you breathing on the other end of the phone. Felix? It's... It's fucking freezing out here. I'm coming inside. Felix? Felix? (FOOTSTEPS) Erin. You're okay. Where's Felix? I stuck a blender in his head and killed him. Oh. Okay. I can't believe you were in on this. (SIGHS) Come on, babe. You do know how broke we are, right? You would have killed me. No! That was never supposed to happen. Even if you hadn't meant to kill me, you must have known I could have died. No. You were supposed to be the witness. A person with a clean record that could attest that our family and neighbors had been murdered by unknown lunatics. It was, in fact, a very important part of my plan that you be unharmed. We needed someone with no motive to see what had happened here. (SIGHS) Someone other than Zee, obviously. Where is Zee? I killed her too. Oh. Totally understand. Listen. I'm sorry things got so out of control, but how were we supposed to know that you were really good at killing people? Which is actually sort of weird, by the way. Had you reacted, um, normally, my parents and siblings would have been killed, you'd have been untouched... and we'd be rich. We'd be on our way to, like, a vacation in Paris. Maybe an engagement? Okay. Okay. (SNIFFLES) There is a silver lining here, by the way. I'm now the sole inheritor of my family's estate. We're talking millions, babe. You. Me. Us. Look. Regardless of our current situation... or whatever we're going through right now... it would be insane to throw that away. I mean, look at all that would be wasted. I understand it might take a while to make this up to you. But in the meantime, let's think about this logically. I know you've got your student loans. How would $500,000 go towards fixing that problem? You could quit your bartending job, just study full time. You know you hate that job. You could have 500,000 within the month. (SIGHS) Or I go to jail... and you get nothing. (SOFTLY) Hey. I love you. I promised you that I'd come back, didn't I? Here I am. () (COUGHING AND GASPING) Why? Why the fuck not? (GUNSHOT) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Oh, fuck. (GASPING) We need medic and backup immediately at 5 Edelweiss Drive. () No! Don't! (GASPS) (MIND THE GAP'S "LOOKING FOR THE MAGIC" PLAYING) All my life I've been Looking for the magic I've been looking for the magic Fantasize on a sexy little tragic I've been looking for the magic In my eyes Oh, in her eyes To keep, oh, oh, oh The magic in my eyes In my eyes Baby, in my eyes On the tips of Vegas Sexy little lay, girl She been looking for the magic Stay a while till the city is a desert She's been looking for the treasure In my eyes Oh, in her eyes To keep, oh, oh, oh The magic in my eyes Baby, in my eyes Baby, in my eyes I Because a photograph Is like an hourglass sometime I And then I never laugh Because I never have no time Oh, in her eyes To keep, oh, oh, oh The magic in my eyes Baby, in my eyes Baby, in my eyes In my eyes Baby, in my eyes Oh, oh Oh, oh In her eyes Baby, in her eyes In her eyes Baby, in her eyes In her eyes Baby, in her eyes
