He's beat up pretty bad, Rose Did he resist? No sign of it. (SIGHING) We need more people. Have you seen him? No. You? No. He's not a guy who should spend a lot of time alone. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) You look terrible. Thank you. Are you expecting someone else? Old habit. I was on my way home from work, . thought I'd stop by, see how you're doing So, how are you doing? Actually, I'm enjoying myself. (DOOR CLOSES) HEALY: Okay. ? You want a drink Oh, I can't. Not yet. You want another one? Not yet. You're supposed to be on medical leave. Actually, I am on medical leave. I'm just taking it at the office. You got a murder. No, I got two murders. n? Think there's a patter I think it might be time to hire a temporary consultant. What's wrong with your people? Nothing. They're young. They're ambitious. They all have multiple degrees. In 10 years' time, they'll develop some instincts. I won't have them that long. . They're working on their resumes I'm on vacation. . You're on suspension Same thing. I need your intuition. You got anything better to do? (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGING) (RINGING CONTINUES) Okay, you think about it. I'll let myself out. n. Hello, Jen How'd you know it was me? n. Coply intuitio Am I calling too late? It's 5:00 in LA, Jenn. I need to talk. Okay. I'm confused. I still care about you, Jesse. You're still living with Elliot, aren't you? Yes. Doesn't sound confused to me. You drinking? Somewhat. Talk to me, Jesse. I talk to you all the time, Jenn. You had a fight. Yes. And Elliot walked out again. Yes. And you still care about me. Yes. I don't think we should talk. You don't think we should talk tonight? I don't think we should talk at all. For how long? As long as it takes. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) What are you looking at? (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGING) (RINGING CONTINUES) I called you When? Lots. Your phone's out of order. Oh, my God. You're not supposed to talk to me. This is my tim So, how's our acting police chief? He's fine. I didn't ask you how he was feeling, I asked you how he was doing. He's fine. What do you think? Well, if they'd given me the job, I'd be way over my head. So? He's way over his head. Well, he's got a good attitude. And one course in Criminal Investigation, which is one more than I have. I'm surprised what's-his-name didn't hire his son-in-law. It's Carter Hanson. And I'm surprised, too. So what about this convenience store robbery? What about it? You sound like me. Final Stop clerk's in a coma Luther's hoping a clue will pop up. It doesn't always happen that way, Rose. I know tha You need to be in the field with him. We wouldn't have anyone to answer the phones. Hire a temp. The Town Council won't let us. You know, I've got some juice with the phone company. We could get them out here. Don't. I need help. Is there something you wanna talk to me about, Jesse? Yes. I bought a cell phone this morning and I don't know how to program it. I thought you didn't like them I don't. Well, I'll help you if you'll give me the number. I can't give you the number. Why can't you give me the number? Because I don't like receiving phone calls. Then why did you get a cell phone (SIGHS) Do you like me, Jesse? Yes Do you like talking to me, Jesse Yes. I don't want anyone else to know the number. First victim was a 23-year-old male. Seventh floor of a parking garage. One shot to the head behind the ear. Yeah. No shell casing, so probably used a revolver. No sign of a struggle, so either he knew the killer or he didn't see it coming. Or both. Parked up top, so he came during rush hour. Stayed late. When he went to his car, the seventh floor was pretty deserted. You know all of this, what do you need me fo I told you. My coply intuition. Nobody even heard the shot. Street noise. It's a happening part of town. Surveillance camer One in the stairwell. Young guy. Looked pretty fit. What time did he exit the stairwell? Five after 10:00. What else did you see on the tape? Well, nobody for about a half hour before and then, three quarters of an hour later, the woman who found the body. JESSE: Well, the shooter was either waiting for him or he just drove around until he found a nice quiet spot for a killing. Mob-related? Which seems like a reasonable assumption. Kid was a wannabe. Freelanced mostly. Who'd he work for? Bixy Chappelle. The late Leo Finn. Presently, Gino Fish. Nothing serious. Mostly he just went for coffee. However, the mob theory is no longer operative. Because? Second victim, a 38-year-old black female. Mother of three. Nice. Same MO. Parking garage. One shot behind the ear. The press doesn't know this stuff. Not hardly. There's going to be more. Do I get a car? Jesse, I thought you knew how to get a car by now. You know, when I was in the hospital, somebody signed a car out of the motor pool under my name. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? About what? Temporary consultants don't get cars. Jesse, you find anything, you give it to me. You're not deputized, you're a consultant. Temporary consultant I don't want anyone else to have it. DIX: Same gun? Same caliber. When will we know if it's a match? Why couldn't I bring Reggie? I wanted to talk to you about him. You want to talk to me about a dog? I thought it would be awkwar He's a dog. Awkward for you. You never show your dog any affection. He's not my do Looks like your dog. He witnessed his owner's murder. He's just staying with me till I can find him a new hom How long has he been there? Three and a half years. Well, he never seems to want any. Besides, he's a pain in the ass. I'll pour a Scotch and I can just feel hi So I look and he's staring at me, like he's my conscience. Then I find myself talking to him. What do you say? The kind of thing you'd say to a roommat a guy, like, "What are you looking at?" It's. You had a dog before, Jesse. Boomer. And where did Boomer sleep? On my bed. Where does Reggie sleep? On his dog bed What happened to Boomer? He died. Do you care about Reggie? Yes, I do. Don't say it. Say what? My wife left me and my dog died about the same tim And I have a fear of loss. I didn't say it. What did Healy really want? I already told you. What did he say when he came to your house? He said that he wanted to see how I was doing. That's a load of crap. He's got a serial killer on his hands. He's also got a temporary colostomy and a lot of rehab. He shouldn't be workin Cop gets shot, he's entitled to some time off. You think there's a definite pattern? (SIGHING) Well, we talk every day. You and Healy? No. Not me and Healy I'm paying you 180 bucks an hour, right Correct. Well, I was wonderin when we could get back to the reason I called. Your wife. Ex-wife. I'm not talking to Jenn anymor You're not talking to Jenn anymore today. I'm not talking to Jenn anymore, period Did you talk to Jenn last night? Yes. But you're not talking to her anymore. That's correct. What if she calls you? She can't. You mean she won't? No, I mean she can't Why not? I had a seminal moment. Don't turn around. Nobody's watching. They could be. Small town. I'm not allowed to talk to you. Maybe we just bumped into each other, small tow I'm still not supposed to talk to yo For the record, I called you, Suit. Your phone's out of order. How do you know my phone's out of order? The information's out there. All you have to do is let it in. You didn't come here to give me donuts, Lou. I'm Jesse. Of course you are. So, how you doing, Chief? I'm not the Chief. Sure you are. I'm the Temp Chief. Do you introduce yourself as "Temp Chief"? No. Well, there you go. So how you doing with this convenience store thing? I can't tell you Paradise is close to the main highway, access both in and out. I know that. Easy mark for a pro. I got a feeling it's a non-pro. You got a feeling. Could have been a local with a drug problem. Could have been. Either way, those kind of robberies are almost impossible to prevent and just as impossible to solve. I know that. The clerk died. You need more people. The Town Council won't let me hire anyone else Because? My sense is they're planning on bringing you back. I don't think so. Something will pop up. It doesn't always happen that way, Suit. Just in case. That's just between you and me. (PHONE RINGING) Paradise Police Department, Officer Gammon. Is this thing working? Yes, Jesse. I can hear you perfectly Rose, did you get the computer-enhanced pictures of the robbery? Oh! Yes, I did. Who called? My mom. Afternoon, Chief Stone. Afternoon, Elizabeth (CAR ENGINE REVVING) You're on the wrong side of the street. Well, you're not on duty, are you, Jesse? No, I'm not, Cissy. Where you headed? Home. Hop in. I'm going that way. (TIRES SCREECHING) (WHISPERING) Did you see that? I forgot something. You won't mind waiting? It's hot in here. It is. How's your place, Jesse? Remote. I'm sorry. We did have financial issues. Remote's good. I don't have your cell number I don't have one. Sit down, Jesse. This might take a whil I was wondering if you'd considered my offer. And what offer would that be? We were dancing. You said you liked my dress. I said I wasn't wearing any underwear, and then I suggested we have some nice, uncomplicated sex with nothing at stake. And what did I say? I think you said, "Wow," at which point your girlfriend cut in What was her name? Abby. That was a long time ago, Cissy. I didn't ask when. I asked if you'd considered it. Often. The offer stands. Sounds like a contract. We run into each other, it's never spoken of, but it's there, you know Are you wearing any underwear now? What do you think? I wasn't sure. I can't. I know you want me. Of course I want you. I'm not dead. You're involved with a friend of mine. Hasty and I are divorced, as you well know. "Convict's wife" was not something that fit well on my resume. I'm talking about Suitcase. Suitcase? Luther. Luther and I are just good friends. He's interested in my business. I'm sure he is. What'd you forget? Excuse me? You said you forgot something. What'd you forget? I forget. (SIGHS) I think I'll walk home. Jesse. It's there if you want it. Wow. JESSE: So I was going through my... ROSE: Options. Yeah. And the phone shut off So I tried to turn it back on, it said to enter my unlock code So I entered my unlock code and it shut off. What's your unlock code? "Reggie." "Reggie" is your password. Same thing. It's not the same thing. Your unlock code is a four-digit number. It's your address. Oh. That's why you didn't get my messages. What messages? I left you four messages. You turn it on, it tells you. Yeah, but I can't turn it on. So he wouldn't talk to you? He said he couldn't. And why can't you hire anyone else? Luther says it's cause they're going to reinstate you. Well, they're not. He says he had a feeling. He gets a lot of those. Feelings aren't enough, Rose. I know that. What's wrong? Did you call Healy? I did. Did you ask him to hire me? Don't do that, Jesse. It doesn't become you. Does Suit confide in you? More and more. Well, you need to help him. I don't know how. I do, but you're not supposed to talk to me. I don't care about that. You're not supposed to talk to me. I don't care about that. Call me? Or call me. HASTY: There's no way to repair it. (SIGHS) Looks pretty good to me, Hasty. I'm talking about your Scout The boys can't fix it. Can't find parts. I mean, how long did you hav that thing up on blocks? Couple of years. (LAUGHING) Well, it's hopeless. You're living on the Atlantic Ocean, Jesse. Rust. Well, I didn't think about it. LA is a desert. Course the insurance compan doesn't know it's hopeless. Maybe we could arrange a little accident. You know, your Scout could have caught fire. You fought through the flames. That would be illegal, Hasty. You're not my parole officer. I'm not insured. Oh. Well, this thing is way beyond your means. I was admiring. Ah. I think I've got maybe just the thing for you. Follow me. I see you found your bow tie. Yeah, Cissy boxed everything up the first day I was in prison. The day I got out, there was an envelope waiting for me with a storage room key in it. What'd she say? Oh, no, no. There was no note. Sweet. She won't return my calls. Could you turn that thing off? Oh. This is it. Jesse, have you seen Cissy? No. You don't think that I still think... Cause I don't think... What do you think? About Cissy? (SIGHS) About the car. Can't afford it. Oh, Jesse, you know I'm very fond of you. Hasty, every time you say that, something bad happens. Can I test drive it? Sure. Take it around the block for a spin. Actually, I was hoping I could test drive it for about a week. He shouldn't be that hard to find an owner for. You just never try. That's not true. You never wanted to. It's understandable. You know, you got a divorce. You had to put your dog down. Isn't that right around the time your girlfriend was murdered? Yes. Existential despair. That sounds awful. Numbness of the heart. I'm a psych major. You were a psych major. Don't you think it's time you went back and finished school? (GRUNTS) That's a big step. Not really, Emily. Have you talked to your parents since they moved away? No. Numbness of the heart. The clerk at the Final Stop died. Luther gave me a picture of the robber, but it doesn't do much good. You know, you can't see his face. I want you to be careful. He says we're an easy target. Convenience stores are. You looking out for me, Jesse? I like you. I was hoping you could feed Reggie if I'm in Boston. Why didn't you say so? I just did. What are you doing in Boston? I can't tell you. Why can't you tell me? I don't know. Old habit. New number. I don't want anyone else to have it. (SIGHING) I'm sorry, I don't know what else I can tell you I understand, I just thought that after you've had this time, if you can think of any argument or any grudge she may have had with someone? My wife had no enemies. If you can think of anything, anything at all, even if it doesn't seem important, you have my number, Mr. Jackson. I don't know what to say to my kids. JESSE: Mother of three. The press is outside waiting for him. Detritus. After they're done sticking cameras in his face, he's just debris. Nobody ever sees that. We do. So what do you think? I think we need to get this son of a bitch. Ballistics are back. Same gun. Your people come up with anything? Not hardly. I don't know where to go. I do. You're supposed to be at rehab. Oh! That's not what I meant. If you've got nowhere to g go back to the beginning. (CRACKLING) JESSE: Hello, Alan. It's flattering you remember my name. Where's your hat? My hat is home. I called. I spoke to... You spoke to me. That was you? That was me. You don't sound like you on the phone. Mr. Fish is in. You're not going to give me a hard time, Alan? You called, asked if you could see him, I said I'd find out. That's the way we do things. (DOOR BUZZES) So, Mr. Fish is in, he's having lunch. You're not going to join him? I already had lunch. (DISHES CLANGING) Jesse Stone. Clearly you're not here in an official capacity. Because I'm not wearing my hat? Cause you've been suspended. Without pay, I believe. I read the papers. I keep up on things. Mmm... Please. Actually, I am here in an official capacity. How so? I'm doing odd jobs for the State Homicide Commander. You're a handyman? Sort of. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't offer you anything. Scotch? Coffee. Steven, Chief Stone will have some coffee. You know it's not good for your nerves. Now, as much as I enjoy your usual banter, you do have a reason for being here, no? You said you read the papers. This would be about the killings. It would. Hey, I'm just a boxing promoter. How long did the first victim work for you? John Kelly. I know of no such person. I'm told he was a business associate... I know of no such person. Well, let's just assume you did. I don't. It was nice seeing you again, Jesse Stone. Thought you already had lunch. I have an enormous appetite. Did you have a nice visit? Did you know John Kelly? Why do you ask? He did some work for Gino. What exactly did my boss say? He said, "I know of no such person." He said it twice. I know of no such person. So what do you know about Cissy and your deputy? What deputy is that? I'm not talking about Rose Gammon. And what would I know about our Temp Chief and Cissy? I know you know. Hasty, you're divorced. I'm still in love with her, Jesse. I think she still loves me. I don't think so. How would you know? Hasty, I got to get going. All right. All right. Just sign these. Wherever it says. There, there. Initials, everything. I'm just testing it. Yeah. For a week. I need for you to be insured. Besides, the car fits you. You drive it around for a week, you're not gonna be able to part with it. So you think. So I know. Don't worry, I'm going to finance it. Hasty. You go to prison, you pay a huge fine and Cissy gets the rest. I wanted her to have that. Yeah, I know. So who's staking you in your new enterprise? Don't ask. Then I don't want to know. So your hearing is coming up? It is. And you're going to piss off the Town Council? Just some of them. It's not very smart. I didn't say it was smart. Old habit. Actually, I'm going to be contrite. I am working on the new me. Because? I need this job. You should know, you hired me. Town Council's going to clean house. How do you know. Used to be their boss. And you made enemies. I'm good at that. Coffee? Sure, Lorraine. Thanks. No, thanks. Thank you. LORRAINE: You're welcome. Listen, they are gonna let everybody go. Any particular reason? A statement was made that they've been infected by you. Carter Hanson's gonna lead the charge. I would expect no less of him. And they're gonna use the convenience store robbery as an excuse and that's why they're not letting them hire more people to help. They don't want them to solve it. Carter Hanson doesn't want them to solve it. (SIGHS) You got a problem with Suitcase. Why do you care? It's just not right. I'm very fond of you, Jesse. How you feeling? Better. Chief Stone. Jesse. He didn't need to hit me, Jesse, he... Liked it? He seemed amped up. Meth head. Why'd he stop? Some guy came by the door, saw me getting beaten up and he walked away. Nice. Gum change the taste of the Scotch? It would if I let it. You chew the gum first, it's going to change the taste. It's two separate deals Meaning? Meaning I bought the gum and I bought the Scotch. Doesn't mean they go together. Well, no, they don't. Gives the Scotch ya kind of metallic taste. Do you have the surveillance tape of the robbery? Not anymore. You record over it? Heartford police chief has it. When was the last time you changed tapes before the robbery? Mmm... Couple of hours before. Could I have that one? You chew the gum after the Scotch, it's the same thing, metallic. I'll get the tape. Rose, where'd you put the surveillance tape of the robbery? I want to work on it tonight. I left it at home. I'm sorry, Luther. Can you bring it in the morning? I will. You think I'm qualified for this? Of course you are. Have you talked to him? I'm not allowed to. How is he? He's pretty beat up about the suspension. He seems freighted down. Self-doubt. You think I want Jesse's job? We can't stake out every target. And we can't talk to him. No, we can't. If I'm not up to this, you can tell me. You're up to it, Luther. I'll bring the tape in the morning. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) You were expecting someone else? Everybody says that. Where have you been? I called you. I've been right here. Is your cell phone on? Yes. You want a drink? How many is that? That was direct. This is two. Well, then I'll have one. You okay? I'm fine. What have you got? Scotch. Got any soda? Just Scotch. Scotch. Neat. You're in a dead zone. Thank you. No, you have no service. You're in a dead zone. Well, that's fine with me. JESSE: Paradise surveillance tape. How did you know? Know what? That Luther wanted that? I didn't. Well, he does. Well, I think you should give it to him. The Heartford Liquor Store just before the robbery. What am I looking for? I'm not going to tell you, I just got a feeling. (SIGHING) "Feelings aren't enough, Rose." Tell me about it. So now I should tell him I've got a feeling? No, you should tell him you have a theory. I'm getting a divorce. Can't make it work? I won't make it work. Not anymore. Jim... He's... A drunk? Small town. I don't know how to tell my boys. They might already have it figured out, Rose. I'll make some coffee. Good night, Dad. Good night, honey. Bye. (CAR LOCK BEEPING) (CAT SCREECHING) (CLANGING) (SCREECHING CONTINUES) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Is this thing working? We got another one. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) No pattern. The lack of a pattern is sometimes a pattern. Michael Lytell, 58. Took his daughter out to dinner. Three kids, all notified. no casings, no witnesses. He's smart. Early bird was looking for a parking spot, found the body, called the attendant, who called the police, who ultimately ID'd the body. It took some doing to locate the daughter. She was... She was devastated. Just sitting there. (CAMERAS CLICKING) (INAUDIBLE) Turn around, you son of a bitch. (BOTH GRUNTING) JESSE: So, why did you lie? I never lie. Okay, why did you leave the wrong impression? Jesse Stone, we never talk about what we're talking about. And besides, your impressi of our conversation is your responsibility. This isn't going very well, is it? Why wouldn't you admit he worked for you, just among friends? Just among friends, I did employ him. His name was John Kelly. I know that. And for what purpose did you employ Mr. Kelly? To get coffee. When's the last time you saw him? Two days before he was killed. He was the first. How do you know there was more than one? Jesse Stone, that's not worthy of you. I read the papers. Newspapers didn't say the three were connected. Please. Do you think there'll be more, just among friends? I do. Hmm... You saw him two days before he was murdered. I did. I'm sure my secretary can confirm the time frame. He's not here. Grocery shopping. (CHATTERING) Sister Mary John. Jesse Stone. SISTER MARY: Gino's not on my list. What list is that? It's kind of a micro list of pimps and various other abusers of my girls. The micro guys get most of my attention. Is there a macro list? Oh, yeah. But that one's not really up to me. Suffice it to say that on his passing, Gino Fish will be going straight to hell. (SIGHING) What's Gino's deal with his secretary? Alan has lasted much longer than most. He thinks nobody knows, or at least won't say it out loud. The vanity of a powerful man. Actually, Alan's on the outs. I'm repeating gossip. That's not in my job description. Can I ask you something? Jesse. Can I ask you something, Jesse? Is it a hard question? I don't think so. Is Gino Fish why we're having dinner? I don't think so. Why did you ask me to dinner? That might be a shrink question. I'm not a shrink. I'm a nun. I know that. Can I tell you something? You can. I don't know what to do at dinner with a nun. I thought I did, but I don't. You eat. Nuns need to eat, Jesse. Hmm. See, I didn't have a problem when there was nothing at stake. Not that there's anything at stake now. Do nuns drink wine? They can. (DOOR OPENING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) If you're not the cleaning lady, I want to know who you are. You sound like me. I saw the light on. You shouldn't be here, Lou. No one saw me. Pull the blinds, if you want. How were things in Boston, Jesse? How did you know? The information's out there. All you have to do is let it in. You working on the robberies? You got anything? Nothing. You can't make the evidence fit your intuition, Suit. The evidence speaks for itself, you have to listen to it. You told me that your first day on the job. My hearing's going to be a formality. After I'm gone, they're gonna let you and Rose go. There is concern that some of me has rubbed off on you. It has. You need to solve these robberies. If he doesn't come back, I don't think that's gonna happen. If he does come back, Rose and I can't be everywhere. I want to help. You can't. I need to help, Suitcase. You can't, I won't let you. (SIGHING) It is what it is, Jesse. (DOOR CLOSING) Good morning, Rose. Hey, Luther, take a look at these. This was taken at the Paradise Final Stop and this was taken at the Heartford robbery. SUITCASE: What's the time frame? This was taken about and this about two hours before the Heartford robbery. Where did you get this Heartford picture? I went there. That's good police work, Rose. What's it tell us? That he was at both crime scenes buying cigarettes. He could have been casing a target for the robber. Could be a coincidence. Cops don't like coincidence. Heartford's like Paradise, close to the main highway with easy access in and out. Somebody commuting to Boston could decide to stop at either one on any given day. If we could just talk to him. How do we find a bald guy who smokes? JESSE: You ever seen that guy? I don't know. I don't think so. Is this about the robberies? It could be. Who is he? Just a guy. If you see him, I want you to call me right away. He'll buy non-filter cigarettes. How do you know? I just know. You're not smoking? Not anymore. Do you own a gun? Should I? If you know how to use one. (SIGHS) Cops aren't supposed to say that kind of thing. I'm not a cop, I'm a consultant. You're always looking out for me, Jesse. If you see him, call me. If there's no answer, leave a message. You closed? It's 6:00. I was hoping to get in a workout. You box? No, I fight. What's the difference? Rules. Nice car. It is. What do you know about John Kelly? I know that he's dead. What else do you know about him? I know that I didn't like him. Does that make me a suspect, Chief Stone? Jesse. You and your boss are close. What do you mean, Jesse? Well, you have meals together. John Kelly was a climber. I don't like people taking advantage of my boss. (CHUCKLES) Mr. Fish said you might want to talk to me. I always like talking to you, Alan. The last time Mr. Fish saw him was two days before he was murdered. You've been briefed. I have. When's the last time you saw him? Two days before he was murdered. Do you have plans tonight? Are you asking me out? No. You and Gino having dinner? I'm going home tonight. I have a life beyond work. (PHONE RINGING) Healy. You called me. Okay, we got John Kelly's lab reports. Toxicology, credit card receipts, nothing. What did he buy the day of? He went to a department store and some place called Milly's. What's Milly's? I don't know. I haven't had a chance to check it out yet. Anything else? Not hardly. You? Not hardly. I missed something. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Excuse me. I'm sorry. I heard screams from another room. I went in. There's this drugged out dope dealer on top of a young girl. Her skirt was up, her clothes were ripped, she was crying. "Get off of her," I said. He turned around, he looked at me like I was nuts. "She's choice," he said. Said he was gonna kill her anyway, so why not put her to good use first. He said it like I should understand. What did you do? I kicked him in the face. He spit out some teeth and he stood up, bleeding all over the hardwood floor. Just stood there staring at me with this smirk on his face. So I shot it off. Put two more in his chest the girl jumped up out of the bed, ran out the back. That was my last day as a cop. Broke open a key of coke, spread it around the room, found his gun, put in his hand. Drug deal gone bad. The girl never surfaced, nobody knew what I did. I went home, pounded a fif of Scotch and passed out. I woke up with a hangover and a revelation. The job and the drinking feed each other. Toxic. You loved the work. I hate fishing. So do I. So why did you suggest it? Seemed like a good idea at the time. Doesn't cost me anything. I'll bill you for a house call. It's freezing out here. You figure it out yet? I don't think it's the kind of thing where a light bulb goes on. Is it Jenn or is it the work that makes you drink? Hell, I don't know. Could be both. I'm not a shrink. I prefer "therapist." When you're on a case, you don't drink. I always drink, but if I'm involved, I don't like to drink a lot. You once told me you wanted to kill her boyfriend. Did you mean that? I was jealous. That's not much of an answer for a shrink. Jealousy isn't a good enough reason? Jealousy's a powerful thing. What I want to know is do you think you meant it? I meant it. So if you could've gotten your hands on him... I would've killed him. Jealousy's a powerful thing. (RAIN PATTERING) (GUNSHOT) Why Alan Garner? JESSE: Something's hinky. Break-ups are hinky. Tell me about it. Alan Garner, background. Born Haverhill, 1978. Mother, Selma. Father not listed. Bachelor's Degree, Business Administration, Boston University. Master's Degree, Criminal Psychology. Okay. Two incidents of domestic violence. Both charges dropped. How long ago? Last one, 2002. Before Gino. Why Alan Garner? Just accumulating data. No, you're not. Jesse, how much do you think you can hold back and still work for me? I don't think John Kelly was random. I think the killer walked up the ramp till he found Kelly's car and waited for him. Why Alan Garner? I think he could've done the killings. You think? Yeah. You got a motive? Milly's is a gay bar. I think John Kelly and Gino had a thing and his main squeeze, Alan, found out about it, he got jealous and he killed him. When he calmed down, he decided to kill more. So how did he select two and three? I have no idea. You think he killed two and three to make it look random, cover up the motive. That's about it. Why'd you go to Gino? I don't know Bixy Chappell Leo Finn's dead. So it's a guess? It is. I guess that's why you hired me. It is. I think you're a good guesser. Look, he's smart. He went to school. He knows criminal behavior. He knows how we work. I know Alan Garner. I don't see him out of control like this. Jealousy's a powerful thing. Where does he live? Right here. I had nothing to do with the killings. I know that. Then why the intrigue? I needed to talk to you in private. This is public. Which makes it private. Were you with Alan Garner the night John Kelly was murdered? No. I want to tell you a story. You want to tell me a story? I do, since you're not his alibi. I think he killed John Kelly. You think? Know, but can't prove. Alan? Why would he? I mean, assuming he's capable of that. He was jealous. Alan would be jealous of what? Alan is a business associate. He might have been afraid he was going to lose his position. Why would he think that? Maybe you took a meeting with Mr. Kelly and Alan assumed the worst. Did you know he has a Master's Degree in Criminal Psychology? No, I didn't. Well, he does. So he would know that if he killed at least two more, it would look like random serial killings. Indicating a sickness. Not for me to say. Maybe he's a ruthless sociopath. Or a sick ruthless sociopath I don't really care. Why should I care? A serial killer who's your personal assistant might not look too good on a boxing promoter's resume. And you're telling me all this because... I'm just giving you a heads up. I'm going after him. If I'm right, and I think I am, this is gonna get in the papers. Huh. Anything you want to tell me? I think you're stirring the pot, Jesse Stone. I am stirring the pot. It's a ridiculous story. It is, isn't it? I don't know what I was thinking. Thanks for straightening me out, Gino. Not at all, Jesse Stone. ROSE: (ON PHONE) Where are you? I'm home. Kind of. I called you, you didn't check your messages. I checked my messages. That's why I'm calling. I gave Emily a picture of the guy. I know. JESSE: How do you know? Because I gave her one, too, and I also gave one to the new clerk at the Final Stop. And the guy in Heartford? ROSE: I did. That's good police work, Rose. What's the Chief think? He doesn't think our smoker is relevant. (SIGHING) Are you going to the range? ROSE: The Temp Chief is adamant about practice. Good. How are you feeling? Well, I'm glad I have my work. Jesse, are you there? Yeah. Keep in touch with Emily, will you? Oh, she checks in all the time. Thank you. And check your message... (SIGHS) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Did Suit talk to you? What about? Nothing. Where were you when I called? Home. Your phone doesn't work at home. I was watching Emily close up. You were looking out for her? I was. Why couldn't you just say that? I don't know. That might be a shrink question. How did you feel? How did I feel? When you moved out. That was different, Rose. You got a divorce, didn't you? Jenn got a divorce. Jesse, you're divorced. Everywhere but in my mind. How many is that? This is one. I haven't slept in a while. How long a while? How long since I've been here? Three days. Three days. I read somewhere that two drinks a day is good for your heart. So I made a rule, two drinks a day. It would give me something to look forward to every evening but it wouldn't scramble my brain. So when I'm thinking right, two drinks a day is about right for me. Don't let me fall asleep. My mom's bringing the boys back in the morning. So, how did you feel? Awful. Awful's one word. How about a sentence? When Jenn and I were together, I tried to pay attention to what she wanted. If she was happy, I always said to myself, "I'm happy." Wasn't true, but I thought that it ought to be true, so I insisted on trying to make it true, matter how unhappy it made both of us. Town Council's gonna let everybody go, Rose. (LAUGHS) JESSE: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) This is Jesse. Leave a message. (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) Jesse, he's here. Pack of Fife's, please. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. JESSE: Jealousy is a powerful thing. Who is this? Where do you keep your .22 revolver, Alan? How did you get this number? You're much too smart to leave it lying around. So where'd you hide it? I do not own any firearms. You mean you do not own any legally-acquired firearms. Same thing. Not hardly, Alan. I'm going to hang up. Okay. Alan, you're still there. I guess you want to know what I know. Did you know the woman had three children? Horrible tragedy. What do you want, Stone? Jesse. What do I want? Well, I want you to go to the State Homicide Commander and explain how and why you did this. Did what? You're not gonna talk to Captain Healy, are you, Alan? I know you have issues, Stone. Jesse. Are you drinking right now, Jesse? I'm talking to you, Alan. Did you do the third one because I showed up at Gino's? I deeply resent that, Alan. I don't think you're psychotic. (LAUGHS) Well, thank you. Now sociopaths, they feel no remorse, they have no conscience. They feel no obligation even to the families of the people they prey on. They just don't care. But then you know that. What? No clever response? You're a cold, ruthless, sociopathic son of a bitch. So what? I'm going to haunt you, Alan? If what you're saying is true, there's really nothing you can do about it. Sure there is, I could just shoot you. You'll be wanting to talk to me. How do you know? We read the same books. I'll be sitting at an outside table at Milly's. I believe you know the place. 3:00. I won't be there. (SIGHS) (VOMITING) (EMILY EXCLAIMING) Open it up. Open it up! Put the money in the bag. Hurry up! (WHIMPERING) Hurry up. Hurry up! Pick it up! Hurry up! Okay. Okay. Okay. Police! Put the gun on the counter and back away from her! I want to see your hands at all times. (LAUGHS) Do it. Put the revolver on the passenger seat. With your right hand, give me the keys. Put this on your right wrist I'll bet you know how. Give me your left hand. You don't wanna mess with those two inside. Those cops are man-eaters. (WOMAN SCREAMING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (PEOPLE EXCLAIMING) (SIGHS) Was he meeting you? Don't ask. I just did. I was just having coffee at my favorite gay bar, Officer. Did he have the weapon? No. He dumped it. Maybe I pushed too hard. You sure it was him? Pretty sure. Proof? Just because there's no proof doesn't mean it isn't true. So you got a look at the plates? No plates. You got a candidate? I got a nominee. He'll have an alibi. He will. Why would Gino take the risk? I guess Alan was a bigger one. How am I gonna be sure it was him? You'd be pretty sure if the killings stop. It's not gonna help me with the press. That's way above my pay grade.
