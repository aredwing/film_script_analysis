You young masters and mistresses Accept without any anger The complaint of a traveler Who followed a princess Into a theater heavens, what misfortune. The idiot thought in his fright That if any freedom remained In our unloved Europe It was in spoken promises That flow from the actor's body How many letters? How many images? How many books, all well-written Were sent in spite of the storm But received in recompense Only absence, silence, indifference? FAREWELL TO You who, every night under your pillows Claudel, Artaud, Molire find Antigone and Lorenzaccio Sometimes think of the other idiot Laboring to align three words I do not know why gentle comrades I must beseech so much And, young and beautiful friends Why I must beg you To not leave the ship stranded Is it possible elsewhere that A pretty battalion would form To cross mountains To look for the words of the other Without obliging him to say his name Romeo who threw chairs And Juliet who rubbed her ass Poor William you are beaten Our world so ill at ease AIDS still unvanquished FAREWELL TO Speech flows from the mouth Can one kiss it, my dear Before you fly off the handle And madly declaim That private life has the force of law? You who sacrifice your body And steal the characters soul Lift yourself up one more time Without considering the adjustments Walking in step with the exception Was it a bit too unreasonable To believe that in this magic place One day the human soul might Pierce the scientific secret Because your hands are in mine? Farewell TNS and Strasbourg The exiled thus takes his step But if the public is in error When one salutes does one not say A very fond hello to you, my dear? Farewell my friends FAREWELL Translation: Ted Fendt Timings: Corvusalbus
