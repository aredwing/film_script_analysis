Would Sir Clifford... accept it as his own? Yes, I think so. But... you didn't mention me? No. I'm going away soon with my father and sister. I could always say I'd met someone there. You're going away? For how long? When do you go? In 3 weeks' time. Around mid-June. I see. That's not far off. Leave it. I'll do it. Sir Clifford will think some society type got you pregnant, won't he? What'd he say if he knew it was me? He'd be furious. But you won't tell him will you? You needn't worry about that. Is that why you wanted me? To have a baby? I don't know. I wanted... I don't know what I wanted. I just wanted... I wanted you. I want you. And a baby, too, perhaps. You didn't consider me? I liked your body. My body? D'you still like it? Yes. I can't imagine that you like to touch me like I do. I do. I love touching you. I don't think so. It's just that I'm a little scared. Do you like it when I touch you? Yes, very much. Well, what's stopping you then? Now you can touch me if you like. Yer beautiful. Can we lie down? If he has the baby we'll have had this. See yer soon then? Go on, yer run along now. Oh, Lady Chatterley, what a pleasure to see you! Good morning, Mrs Bentley. Sir Clifford isn't with you? I'm afraid not. He rarely comes now. Excuse me, I live just opposite the Company. Sir Clifford passes by my window every time he goes to work. Is Sir Clifford as well as they say? He's in fine form, thank you. I felt it as soon as you came in. You look absolutely radiant. Hello. - Can I come in? - Come on in. I'm not disturbing you? No, I just got back from Uthwaite about some poachers. Please carry on eating. Do you want a cup of tea? The kettle's boiling. Maybe I can do it. If you like. The pot's there. And the tea's on the shelf. Is that you? In that photo. Is that you at your wedding? Just after. Were you in love with her when the photo was taken? I suppose so, in a way. I was smitten. Do you still love her? Me? No, I don't love her any more. But it wasn't love anyway. It wasn't love between us. But... Really? I'd rather change the subject. When did you lose your husband? Really... He was 28. And I was 24. Was it in the mine? Yes, an explosion. Mining wasn't for him. His father was a miner, so he was too. But he wasn't cut out to go down the mine. You often think of him? Oh, yes. I can't help it. It was so sudden. And we were so happy together. A few days later, Clifford wished to go out with Constance. Look at me on my foaming steed! - Coughing, more like. - Yes, that's it. Spluttering, even! I thought we could do some work on the house next year. The mine's doing well. What if there are more strikes? Why on earth should they go on strike again? They'd ruin the industry... or what's left of it. Maybe they don't care about ruining it... It's what fills their bellies. If not their pockets, as Mrs Bolton would say. No, I'm not too worried about strikes. Simply because they'll soon be virtually impossible. What do you mean? Are you going to ban strikes? The miners will never let you! We won't tell them. It's for their own good. The slightest spanner in the works and they'd starve. They would, not me. I have other resources. Are you so sure that there's nothing good in socialism? Heavens, no! Nothing is more dangerous than an ideal based on lies. The masses only want one thing: masters. - Meaning you. - Meaning me. You, us. Well, I'm sorry, but I find that rather facile. What? That some are made to command, others to obey. That's the way it's always been. May I remind you on which side you were born? - I don't play boss. - Of course you do. You are one. All your servants know it full well. Being pleasant to them doesn't change your role. You're their boss, like it or not. Even with Mrs Bolton. I'm sure I don't boss her. No, you ask her to do things. And she does. It's exactly the same. What if I tried to go to the spring? I haven't seen it in ages. Yes, why not? - Will you come to my place tonight? - Tonight? Yes, this evening. For the night. All right. I must go. I'll wait at the gate. Around 10... This chair is admirable. It's icy cold. Shouldn't one make a wish? One should. And did you? Yes, but one mustn't tell. You should hoot for Parkin. Let her catch her breath. Is there a stone to put under the wheel? - I'll help. - No, don't push! What's the point of the engine? Put the stone back. - You should call... - Leave me alone! Can't you stay still for 5 minutes? I thought you were having trouble. Won't it move? It would seem not. - Is there any petrol? - Of course! A full tank. What's wrong? Can you see? No. The connections look fine. Give her a try. That's better. I'll just push... Wait! Let the engine try. She's got to do it. Clifford, this chair can't move on her own! Why bother insisting? She won't do it. She's done it before. Careful! There! What did I tell you? - You're pushing? - Ay. Let go of her! - She won't make it on her own. - Let go! It's what she was made for. She has to do it. Clifford, the brake! The brake! The brake, Clifford! I'm clearly at everyone's mercy. I think this chair needs pushing. Would you be so kind as to push me home, Parkin? I hope I didn't offend you at all. No, no offence, sir. Would you like me to push the chair? Please do. Is that really necessary? You should have let us push before. Parkin, it only remains for me to thank you. I need another engine for this chair. Go and have a beer in the kitchen, won't you? No, thank you, sir. I'll be getting back. I'll lunch in my room If you don't mind. As you wish, my dear. Cards. - 3. - 2. - You're here... - Yes. You're on time. Yes, it was very easy. Do you hear those noises? It's the trees. It sounds like they call each other, each in their own language. And what are they? Pine trees. You leave the light on? At night, I do. Then people can't tell if I'm in or not. What people? I don't know. Anybody. Do you want something to eat? No, thank you. But you eat if you're hungry. I'm all right. I'll just make some tea. Do you want one? Yes, please. Will you love me? Yes... I'll love you. You must love me. You should take that off. Take yours off then. Turn round. Turn round Before you put the candle out. You're already awake? Yer better go. Is it sunny? It will be. How curious. It's tiny now. Like a bud. When did you say Hilda was coming for you? On Thursday. Oh, yes, that's right, Thursday. When will you be back? A month later. If you ever do come back. - Why wouldn't I come back? - Who knows? The hand of God... An earthquake... Or a heart quake. Talking of which, is your sister looking for a new husband too? I mean, as well as yours. Not that I know of. The plan only concerns you? Would you like to know my conditions? - Your conditions? - As the legal father. Or had that detail slipped your mind? Go ahead. The child will be English on both sides. On the father's side, of at least decent stock. I shall bear it in mind. Right... - I thought you'd got lost. - Lost? No. But I was getting ready to leave. When do you go? Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. My sister's picking me up. We leave after lunch. - Where are you going? - To London, then Paris. And near the Italian border, near Menton. Not where the war was? No. Much further south. By the seaside. It's only for a month. Won't you be glad to see me again? You know... it'll do me good to go away. I haven't been away in so long. Ay, it'll do you good. What are you doing? I want to run in the rain. Don't you think you're wet enough? No, not at all. I have to take all this off. Wait. It's pretty. You need a flower too. Wait there. It's too long. There. That's good. You need a crown too. It would be so good if we were alone in this forest. Come here. Wouldn't yer like to go to Canada with me? The world's the same everywhere. It'll be the same in Canada. But nobody will know who we are. Not at first. But they will. Then, it'll be just the same. Wouldn't you like me to buy a little farm? You could look after it. I have enough of my own money. Then, you'd be your own boss. How much have yer got? I don't know exactly. Every year? It's my mother's inheritance. Well, I never...! I thought I was comfortably off with 100 saved up. Wouldn't you like to have a farm? My sister could help me find one. She's very practically minded. I don't think I'd want a woman to set me up. I'm not just any woman. And anyway... it wouldn't be just setting you up. You could start the farm, then I could come and live with you. If we decide to get divorced and live together. Yer'd never want to live with me on a farm. Yer'd never want to be Mrs Oliver Parkin. I would! Why wouldn't I? And you'd be independent, you wouldn't owe anyone anything. I think what you prefer is being alone as much as possible. You like seeing me from time to time, but I don't think you want me here all the time. That's why I think you should have a farm where I could come from time to time, without worrying about marriage. Yer right. Once you marry a woman, it's a mess. She starts bossing you about. Well, usually, the man does the bossing. Forget it. God, how I love you! The next day, Constance was delighted to be leaving. I'll be right back. Goodbye, Clifford. Bon voyage, Connie. Go on, drive off. Stop! What? Stop, I beg you! Stop! You're here... Don't cry. It'll be all right. It'll be just fine. Yer fly away now. What is going on? Well, what a good start! The two women met their father in London. where they spent a few days before going to Southampton. The three of them formed a clan, protecting each other. And Constance realised to her surprise the power of these family ties although she had so often denied it. On the ferry, she confided in Hilda who disapproved of the misalliance, but couldn't help being in sympathy with the passion itself. In Paris, the trio became a quartet. Duncan Forbes, a Scottish painter, the sister's childhood friend, joined them. They set off together across France from north to south, stopping wherever the fancy took them. Finally, they came to their destination, 2 weeks after they left, they reached the Villa Natividad on the Riviera. Constance was only happy with Hilda and Duncan. For the first few days, she had loved it. But she now felt a sort of creeping malaise which she was unable to control. She received regular news from Clifford. He was glad she was enjoying the Riviera and told her with his typical wit of his recent readings and a few anecdotes about Wragby life. His best stories came straight from Mrs Bolton who had told him that very morning about the gamekeeper's misadventures. The day before, Bertha, Parkin's lawful wife, had moved back in, with all her worldly goods. The man she used to live with, a miner, had apparently thrown her out. I have just received your letter. I am replying in a quiet moment. You will be surprised and happy by the state of Sir Clifford's health. He has recovered so well that all he thinks of is seeing you again. As for Parkin, the situation changes every day. The day after Bertha turned up, she went to the JP to get Parkin to live a decent life with her at last. But Parkin flatly refused. So, the JP told him to apply for a divorce. Parkin said he would as soon as possible. Parkin's been at his mother's for a week now. He now says he has to leave and Sir Clifford will have to find a new gamekeeper. I was about to close, but there's more news, so I'll write in haste. As Parkin went past the inn, Bertha's brother was there with his mates. They'd all been drinking. Dan Coutts stopped him, then threw himself on him. They went out the back to fight. They say it was a terrible sight. All those brutes standing around, watching. Parkin was knocked to the ground and hit his head on the rails in the courtyard. The doctor said he had slight concussion, but he didn't stop retching for hours. We were so worried. I went to see him at his mother's. He's a bit better. I told him you were coming back soon, and he just turned and looked at me. Then, he fell asleep. My dear Connie! How are you? Me? Just fine. But what about you? It's a miracle to see you standing. Can you walk? I wouldn't call it walking. But I can go forward in my own way. Field! Were you in on the plot? Surprised, my lady? You can say that again! And a little scared too. It's not dangerous? No, you needn't worry. Shall we go? Or would you rather I fetch the chair? Let's go. At last, my lady, you're here! Welcome home! What a joy to see you again. Let me kiss you. All right, Clifford? The steps are the hardest part. It's really wonderful. Come on, Marshall, let's go. You must be exhausted. How was the journey? It went perfectly. Thank you for your letter. What would I do without you? So, what happened in the end? Is Parkin here? He moved out yesterday. The new gamekeeper is moving in. The new gamekeeper... Mrs Bolton? Excuse me... Coming. I wanted to tell you... I think I'm going to have a baby. Have you told Sir Clifford? Not yet. When you do, will he accept it? Yes. You shouldn't hate him for that. I don't hate him. Yes, you do. You hate everyone at the moment. Yes, yer right. I feel like I've swallowed poison. It's horrible. Is it the idea of going to Sheffield? Yeah, I hate the idea of that too. You'd rather have stayed here? No use discussing it. I've always known it wouldn't last. It's over. No, listen to me. Don't go to Sheffield. It's not in your nature. You'll be unhappy there. Why can't we look for a place of our own? That's all over and done with. And it's not right for a man to live off a woman. I'm so worried you'll be unhappy there. We'll see... But promise me... Look at me. Promise me, if you're really unhappy you'll let me find you something else. Do you promise? The thing is, I can't be like other folk. I'm so unhappy when I can't be alone. But why should you be like other folk? It's better you're not. No, it's not. You have to be like other folk. When I was a kid, my mother kept calling me a girl. She said there was something in my character, like, that was more like a woman than a man. Well, maybe she was right. Why do you say that as if it were a weakness. It's not. You're more sensitive than idiots like Dan Coutts. You should be proud of being sensitive. Yer can call it being sensitive or whatever. I see it as a handicap. The idea of going to that factory is like death! Other folk manage it without making a fuss. That's why I wanted to go to Canada. But yer don't want to go, so... No, please don't go to Canada. I've been there and to America. I couldn't be happy there. And I don't think you'd like it either. It'd kill something in you. You have a gift. You don't realise it, but I know. You have the gift of life. Now I'm afraid you'll spoil it when I need it so much. Please trust me. I know one thing for sure: you only get one life. Exactly. That's just it. I can give you the money tomorrow and you can buy a place. A little farm you could work on. No! You don't understand. I love you. If you only knew how much! But I mustn't feel small. I feel like there's no place for me, like I'm worth nothing to no one... except to you. When you went away, I tried not to think about you too much, because it was no use. What was the point? But when I still thought about you... I said to myself: You're like my home. And yet, real houses don't mean much to me. It's because... until I met you, everything was like a prison to me. I felt locked up, belittled. You opened up the world to me. And when I think of that... how you opened up to me... how you gave me freedom... I think I'm stupid to be afraid. And if you want me to work on a farm next year, then, I accept. I'm sorry. It's because I'm so happy we're together again. I better go now without saying goodbye or anything. But I just wanted to say that while we're apart, I mean, while we're not together, I don't mind if you see other women. I won't need to. You never know. But don't tell me. It'll be your secret. But keep your heart gentle. Because if you do I'll never lose you. I've been without women before. I can wait, you know. Really? You'll wait for me? If I need you one day, if I can't stand my life, if I decide to leave Clifford you'll come for me? If you think you need me I'll come. If you think you have no other choice I'll do what's best for us. I'll get a job on a farm and... You'll come for me if I can't bear it any more? Yes.
