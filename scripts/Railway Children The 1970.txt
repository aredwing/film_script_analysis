We were just ordinary suburban children and we lived with Father and Mother in an ordinary red brick fronted villa with coloured glass in the front door... Come on. ... a tiled passage that was called a hall and big fires in big fireplaces. We even had a gas fire in the breakfast room and a servant's bell board. In fact, every modern convenience. Chins up! There we three of us. Now let's arrange your pretty hair. That's me, I'm Roberta. They call me Bobbie, sometimes Lanky. I'm the eldest, worst luck. That's Phyllis, who means well. And that's Peter, who wants to be an engineer. And don't forget to watch the dickey bird. Watch the birdie. Mother did not spend all her time paying dull calls to dull ladies and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls on her. She was always there, with us. We had a father who was just perfect. Her light's growing dim and if it goes out, then she's dead. She says she would be get well again if children believed in fairies. - Do you believe in fairies? - Yes. That's not loud enough. Do you believe in fairies? Yes! It's still not loud enough. Do you believe in fairies? YES! Yes, I certainly do! Mmm, it smells gorgeous. It's fabulous, absolutely fabulous. Now altogether... one, two, three. Well done! Happy Christmas! I love you. You will think that we ought to have been very happy and we were but we did not know how happy till the pretty life at Edgecombe Villa was over and done with and we had to live a very different life indeed. Peter my boy, come here. Dad... it's perfect. It's more perfect than any one could ever dream of. Thank you, Dad. The dreadful change came quite suddenly. You heaving brute! And that was the last we saw of poor Potts. What a wreck! - Is there any hope? - Hope? Of course, it'll want hope yes, and a new valve. I'll tell you what, I'll give up Saturday afternoon to it. Yes, and you can help me. I hate doing a job like this especially at Christmas. Who on earth is that? An Englishman's house is his castle, but I wish they had moats and drawbridges! Come in. Yes? Please, sir. There are two gentlemen wish to see you. I've shown them into the study, sir, I hope that was all right? Excuse me. I wish we did have a moat and drawbridge. Then if we didn't want anyone to... I've never heard anything so preposterous. When? Who? - Why's Daddy shouting? - I don't know, dear. Come in. Yes, Ruth? What is it? Please, ma'am, the Master wants you to just step into the study. Look, I'm not going to say a thing! Come in. I will not! All right, cabby, Scotland Yard. It's bed-time. Ruth will put you to bed. But you promised we could stay up late. Daddy was going to play with us. Father's been called away... on business. Go up at once darlings, please. It wasn't bad news, was it, Mummy? Is anyone dead or... Oh, no, nobody's dead. I can't tell you anything about it tonight. Up you go. Well, good night then. Ruth! What's up? Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies. You'll know soon enough. - Phyl? - Yes. If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying then we won't know. - That's all. - All right. She's gone into London, that's all I know. Now just you eat up. Some dire calamity's happening, I just know it. Good evening, Mrs Waterbury. - Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening, Sally. Oh, it's so cold! Let's get to the fire, Peter, come on. My darlings, those men last night did bring very bad news and Father will be away for some time Is it something to do with the Government, Mummy? Yes... yes, it is. Now it's bed time, my darlings. And don't worry. It will all come right in the end. Don't you worry either because we'll be as good as gold. Oh, we used to say life was so dull... Nothing ever happened like in books. Now something has happened. Yes, it has and it's made Mother unhappy. Everything's horrid... ...just horrid. Stairs... stairs... stairs... Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks. Mother was nearly always out, the between maid was sent away... ... and Aunt Emma came on a visit. - Good afternoon, children. - Good afternoon, Aunt Emma. Your mother has sent for me in her distress, and I'm here for a while but not for long. I'm off to India as a governess and as I shall be busy preparing for my arduous journey, I shall require you to be seen and not heard. Preferably to be not seen and not heard. Children should be kept in their proper places. - Do you understand? - Yes, Aunt Emma. - Yes, Aunt Emma. - Excellent. You may kiss me if you wish. # You can hear them sigh and wish to die # You can see them wink the other eye # At the man who broke the Bank at Monte Carlo Altogether now # As I walked along the Bois Boulogne with an inde... # I have asked you not to use them utensils in that manner. I was up at four this morning cleaning them as if I haven't got enough to do what with the between maid leaving and now your aunt asking me to heave bloomin' great boxes about like I was a navvy or something. - Ruth. - Yes? There's no need to be so rude. Cook was just trying to cheer us up. Come on, you two. Well... I'm very surprised at you, Cook. Where's your dignity? And take that silly hat off. Get yourself dressed properly. I don't know I seem to do all the work round here. We shouldn't really Peter, she'll get soaked. It's too late, she's coming. Stairs... stairs... stairs... I'll have fallen arches before me holiday. I hope you're undressed and ready, master Peter. I haven't got all night, you know. - Yes, Ruth. - Good... You...! - Oh! Stop it! - You nasty little limb, you! If you don't mend your ways you'll go where your precious father's gone, so I tell you straight. Ruth! Huh! We're going to have to play at being poor for a while. We're moving to a darling little house in the country, up in Yorkshire. - What? - I know you'll love it - Is Aunt Emma coming? - No, Peter, unfortunately not. - Don't you want a 1st Class, madam? - No, Second. Thank you. Ah, looked like 1st Class quality to me. - Are we on the right train for Yorkshire? - Yes. Thank you. Ooh... careful. Give that to me. - I'll take that bag. - Thank you so much. - Goodbye. - Thank you. Goodbye. Excuse me. We want to go to the house on the hill. The Three Chimneys. - Er, do you know the way? - I daresay. - Well, will you show us? - I dare say. - Phyllis, are you all right? - Yes. Can't we put just one box on your cart? You asked me to show you the way, nothing was said about boxes. Never mind, darlings. It's only a few more yards. I wonder why she didn't leave the lights on. Who is she? Mrs Viney, The woman I engaged to clean the place and to get the supper. I expect Mrs Viney's gone home. Your train was late, see. But she's got the key. What do we do? She'll have left that under the doorstep. - We all do hereabouts. - Well you might have said so. You never asked, did you? Nothing was said about a door key. - May I borrow your lamp, please? - I daresay. If you say "I daresay" once more, I shall have hysterics, I daresay Oh... there we are. What's that? It's only the rats. God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform. Ow! Rats! I wish we hadn't come. Don't you worry, darlings. I saw a paraffin lamp on the table, we'll soon have some light. Oh, those poor little mice, they were so frightened. I don't believe they were rats at all. You've often said you wanted something to happen, well now it has. It's quite exciting, isn't it? I told Mrs Viney to get some meat and bread and have some supper ready. I wonder where... Oh, I suppose she's laid it in the dining room. Come along darlings, up here. Let's go and see. Come along. Oh darlings, mind the steps. Mind how you go, Peter. Oh, that beastly woman! She's taken the money and not left us any food. Aren't we going to have any supper tonight? I'm starving! I know! There's some food in the cases in the cellar. Aunt Emma sent them on ahead of us. Come along. Mind the step. Come along, Bobbie, it's a real feast. Sardines, biscuits, ginger. Raisins... No Phyl, no! You do not put the marmalade spoon in to the sardines. Oh, Mummy, it's gorgeous, Mummy. Tell you what, let's drink Aunt Emma's health. - Good idea. - Here's to Aunt Emma. - To Aunt Emma. - Aunt Emma. And all who sail in her. - Oh! What's that, Mummy? - Pie. - Pie? - Apple Pie. Apple pie for breakfast? Then we're not poor after all. This is the supper we should have had. I found it in that little room that we thought was a cupboard, so Mrs Viney wasn't so bad after all. - Good morning, can I help you? - I expect so. Viney's the name. Hilda Viney, ma'am... Missus. Do come in. We're just been talking about you. Oh, I see you found your supper then. Funny time to have it though. It was like a great dragon tearing by. A dragon's house looks like that tunnel. I never thought we'd ever get so near to a train as this. - It's better than toy engines, isn't it? - I don't know, it's different. It seems so odd to see all of a train. It's so tall. I've always seen them cut in half by platforms I wonder if that train's going to London? London is where Daddy is. - We don't know that, Phyl. - He might be. How do you do? - How do you do? - Yes. - Could I ask you two questions? - Yes, well it depends what they are. I can't spend all day conversationalising with the junior public. Now what are they? What's the white mark on the coal heap for? That's to tell you how much coal there is you see, in case anybody nicks it. Second question, please. Do you know anything about engines? Do I know anything about engines? Why? - Because I've got one. - Er, what gauge? I don't know anything about gauges, but it's about this big. Yes? - It's brass and it blew up. - It blew up. Well just excuse me young man, I've got a lot to do cos the Station Master's having his hair cut in Leeds, you see and Perks must be about it. - Perks? Who's Perks? - Me, sir. I'm Perks. Right on time. - What is? - This ere's the Scots Flyer. Why is it going so slowly, Mr Perks? Why... well it's all up hill to Scotland, isn't it? That train's going to Scotland. If Daddy's not in London, he's in Scotland and that train is going to Scotland. Perhaps, Phyl. I don't think we're going to enjoy being poor, you know, being cold and all that. Phyllis, try to imagine it as an adventure. All sorts of things might happen. Mother could write about it. Write a book. You never know. We won't always be poor, Phyllis, I'm sure. All right. Good night. Good night. I'm still cold though. ...lightly on the-cheek. ...one of the men, in a bowler hat, opened the door... Father did not turn, but left without a word. Why don't we ask the next train to take our love to Daddy? Trains don't carry people's love, they'd be above that. Yes, they do if you tame them first. I wonder why Daddy hasn't written to us. Mummy says he's too busy. he'll write soon, she says. Well, why don't we wave anyway? Three waves won't matter. We won't miss them. Charming... Charming! About time they had it seen to. The coal in the little shed has held out well, Bobbie. There was hardly any there yesterday when I looked. Well, we've only had one fire. I know but I could swear there's more than when we first came. - That's silly. - Course it's silly. So it's you, Pete. - It's you. - It's me what? It's you that's been putting the coal in the shed. But where from Pete, for heaven's sake? From the coal heap of course, they've got stacks of it there. But that's stealing! Don't you remember your catechism? "Thou shalt not steal sayest the Lord" It wasn't stealing. It was mining. I took from the top. That's mining, not stealing. If it was, all the miners in the world would be in jug. Oh, Pete... Pete! Oh Pete, Pete. We'll have to take it all back. - What? - All of it. - All of it. - All of it! All of it. There can't be anything wrong in trying to keep your own mother warm. That can't be wrong. It's all right Pete, at least we can burn the evidence. Mrs Viney, here we are. I've got the buns for tea. - Buns? - Yes, Mummy sold a story and... Mrs Viney, what's the matter? It's your dear ma, master Peter, she's... she's very poorly. You'd better go back to the village and get Dr Forrest. Right. Don't let her die, Mrs Viney. Doctor Forrest! Mother's very ill, please come quickly, Stay there, my boy. Influenza. But not serious. Now my Lady Grave-airs, I suppose you'll want to be head nurse? - Of course, Doctor. - Right. Now we'll send down some medicine. Keep a good fire going and have some strong beef tea ready to give her the moment the fever goes down... She can have the grapes now and the soda water. Oh, and you'd better get a bottle of brandy. You can go in now... May I have the list? Don't worry, funny face. She's head nurse but you can be Matron. Oh, thank you. Oh, what utter nonsense, I can't afford all that. I haven't an idea in my head for a story so there won't even be buns for tea for some time. Tell Mrs Viney to boil some scrag-end of neck for your dinner tomorrow then I'll have some of the broth. But even if we never have anything to eat at all you can't afford all those other things. Right. So we've got to think of some other way. Now everybody, think. Just as hard as ever you can, think! - I, O, N. - You sure? Yes. I... O... N. There. Brilliant. "Look out at the station. " Definitely one of your best works, Michael Angelo. Oakworth Station! Oakworth! Oakworth! Oakworth Station. Oh, I thought I'd missed you. You are the man who waves to us, aren't you? - Mind the doors, please. - Aren't you? - Yes my dear, I wave... - Oh, will you take this, please. We chose you because we thought you had such a kind face. Er, mind the doors please, Miss. Sir. On the way, Mr, Mitchell. Thank you, Mr Perks. - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. Oh dear! Oh! Good evening. The name's Perks. I believe we've met. Yes, you were busycause of the Station Master being in Leeds. Yes, even busier now 'cause he had a drop too much down at the Britannia Arms and fell over and broke his daft leg playing billiards. - Of course it was his own fault. - Why? He should've used the rest. He will do that over the edge, you see. The old gent asked me to fetch this up straight away. Thank you very much, Mr Perks. I'm very sorry I haven't got two pence to give you like Father does, but... Hey! Just stop that, please. I wasn't thinking about no tuppences. I just came to say I was sorry to hear your mama wasn't so well and to ask how she finds herself this evening. Oh and I've er, I brought her a bit of sweet briar. It's very sweet to smell that is. Tuppence indeed. Thank you very much and I beg your pardon about the twopence. No offences, I'm sure. No offence. And just to show I'll er, I'll have a look at that blown up brass engine of yourn, shall I? - What? - Yes. Oh, can you manage? Bit heavy... Here you are. Oh. Is that it? Bit of a mess, isn't it? Still I'll er, I'll see what I can do. - Good evening. - Thank you, Mr Perks. Good night. - Oh! - Oh, look at that! Oh, everything... "Dear Roberta, Phyllis and Peter, "here are the things you want. "Your mother will want to know where they came from "so please ask her to forgive me "for taking the liberty of allowing myself the great pleasure. "Yours sincerely, G. P... Something. " I can't read it. I think we were right to ask him. Right? Of course we're right. I don't fancy telling Mother the whole truth about this. We shouldn't do that until she's completely well. And when she is, we'll be so happy we shan't mind the fuss. Oh, look at those roses! I'll take them up to her. - And the sweetbriar. - Oh, thank you. Cor, look! I wonder what's in there. So that's an end to it! Now listen. It's true, we're poor, but we shall have enough to live on as long as I have ideas for stories. But you mustn't go about telling people of our affairs. It isn't right! And you must never, never, never ask strangers to give you things. Always remember that. - Yes, Mother. - I shall write to your old gentleman and I shall tell him that I didn't approve. I shall thank him too, of course, for his kindness, but it you that I don't approve of, not the old gentleman. He's been extremely kind. You can give my letter to your Mr Perks to give to him. And we won't say any more about it. Isn't she marvellous when she's angry? Hello, head-nurse. That's funny, I was thinking about you. I wanted to talk to you, Doctor. - Your mother's not worse I hope? - No, but... Come on, we'll go for a ride. This is great fun. Come on, out with it, head-nurse. What's the trouble? It's rather hard, you see, toout with it' because of what Mother said. What did Mother say? She said I wasn't to go telling everyone that we're poor. - But you aren't everyone, are you? - Not at all. Well? Well, I know doctors are very expensive and Mrs Viney told me that her doctor only cost her twopence a week - because she belonged to a club. - Yes. Well, could we join your club too, please? The same as Mr Viney. You aren't cross with me, are you? Cross? How could I be? You're a very sensible little woman. Now don't you worry. I'll make it all right with your mother, even if I have to make a special brand-new club just for her. Thank you. Bobbie, you're to tidy yourself up in here. Here's a new ribbon for you. There, the surprise is ready. When the bell rings again you can come into the dining room. Come on, Pete. Of course. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, head-nurse. Happy birthday, Miss Roberta. My darling. I helped to make it. Happy birthday, Lanky. # She was beautiful as a butterfly # Proud as a queen # Was pretty little Polly Perkins # Of Paddington Green # - Many happy returns. - Thank you. Lanky indeed! Fatty. - Hope you enjoy the cake. - It's lovely. Thank you very much. - Have a lovely party, my dear. - Thank you for coming. Thank you. Wouldn't Daddy have loved this? Thank you very much, Mrs Waterbury. Good night, good night. Happy birthday! Hey, happy birthday! I hope Mother doesn't get too wet in Wakefield. We don't want her ill again. It's like being in a besieged castle, the arrows of the foe striking against the battlements. No, it's more like a great big garden-squirt. - You're a great big garden squirt - Thank you. Stop it you two! There's a train coming. Oakworth! Oakworth Station! Oakworth! Oakworth Station! Come on. Don't mind the rain, it's only a shower. That's it, thank you. Mind the doors, please. Mind the doors now. Mind the doors, come on. Right away, Mr Mainprice Mother should be on the next train in about fifteen minutes. That one was from London, I think. Hey, there's something going at the end of the station. Yes, something's happened, come on. If you ask me this is a case for the police courts. No, the infirmary more like. Let me pass please, will you? I'll deal with this if you please. - What's he say? - Sounds like French to me. I was in Calais once for a day. - That's not French. - Well what is it then if it's not French? I don't know. It's not French, I know that. No, that's not French. Nothing like it. Try him with French if you know so much then, clever dick. Parlez vous franais, Monsieur? Ah, Dieu merci! Dieu merci! Enfin un amis. Mon petit vous ne soures jamais combien je suis content. - Now that's French. - What's he say? I don't know... Yes, well all right everybody. Keep moving along, please. I'll deal with this. Move along. Thank you. All right now, now, now... Go on. Take him into the waiting room. Mother can talk French. She's on the next train from Wakefield. Right. Come on. He thinks you're a policeman. He thinks you're going to shut him up. I know he does. Look at his eyes. They're like a fox's eyes when the beast is in a trap. Vous attendre. Ma mere parlez franais. Nous... - What's "being kind"? - Er, "bon" is good. Nous sommes bon pour vous, Monsieur. Sorry, Malcolm. I'll see you down at the Fleece later and I'll tell you all about it. C'est bon. Ma mere arrive, c'est bon. Je vous aide. Look I'm not sure we oughtn't to send for police. - Don't! - Oh, don't. Wait till Mummy comes. She speaks French beautifully. You'd love to hear her. I'm sure he hasn't done anything like you're sent to prison for. Yes, well he looks without visible means to me. Still I don't mind waiting till your mama comes. I'd like to know what country has got the credit of him. Look, I've got an idea. Foreign stamps. We'll show them these. Regardes les stamps. Quelle patrie? Ah... Ruskie... - Ruskie. - My lord, he's Russian. Yeah, I-I thought he was. I'll wait here till you bring Mummy in. Not afraid? No. Oakworth Station! Mrs Waterbury, I have something to tell you. - Mummy, we found a Russian. - There's a fellow in there, he's Russian. Close the doors. Right away, Guard! You wouldn't hurt me, would you? Hello, Bobbie. Qui est vous? Madame, je m'appelle Szczepansky. Oh, it's all right. Bobbie go and fetch Doctor Forrest. - We'll take him home with us, Mr Perks. - Thank you, Madam. Come on, help him on the other side. Don't worry. Don't worry, she'll look after you. I knew he was a Russian. Doctor. I need to tell you. Mother's got a very shabby Russian. Your mother's got a very shabby what? He'll have to join your club. I'm certain he hasn't any money. We found him at the station. - Found him? Was he lost then? - Yes, that's what he was. He's been telling Mother life story in French. She said would you please come directly. He's got a nasty cough and he's been crying. Oh, don't smile. Please don't. You wouldn't if you'd seen him. I've never seen a man cry before. Haven't you? I do it all the time. Bobbie! I know you said we weren't to ask any questions but Daddy isn't... isn't dead, is he? Oh, my darling, no. Bobbie, look at me. Daddy was quite, quite well when I heard from him last and he'll come back to us some day. Do tell us about the Russian. That can't make a long story, my darling, because I'm very tired. He's a very clever writer, but in Russia one dare not say anything about the rich people doing wrong or what ought to be done for the poor. If one does, one is sent to prison. Well he wrote a book about it all and he was three years in a dungeon. No light, damp and dreadful. Then they took him out and they sent him to Siberia and he was condemned to stay there for life. - For life? For writing a book? - That's stupid. Go on, Mama. While he was at the mines, some friends got a message to him to say that his wife and children had escaped to England. So after many adventures he too escaped and came here to look for them. - Do you think he will find them? - Oh, I do hope so. I think my darlings, in your prayers you might ask God to show his pity upon all prisoners and captives. To show his pity upon all prisoners and captives? Yes, darling. Upon all the prisoners and captives. Merci. He seemed pleased. I wish we could think of other things to give him. What about strawberries? Perks promised me some from his own garden ages ago. Look at that tree over there! Lor, it's moving! So are the others... It's magic. What is it? It's much too magic for me. I don't like it, I'm going home. Cor, that'll take some sweeping up. Hey! The 11:29 down hasn't gone by yet. We must let them know at the station, there'll be an accident. - Let's run! - No, come back. It's too late, it's two miles away. - We do something to the telegraph wires. - But we don't know how. If we only had something red, we could go down on to the line and wave it. But the train wouldn't see us till it came round the corner. That's too late. We could go round and wave to the train. We might wave anyway. No. They'd only think it was us as usual, we've waved so often before. - Flannel petticoats! - I beg your pardon? - Flannel petticoats. - Of course! Take them off. - Now. - You're not going to tear them, Pete? - Oh, shut up - Yes, tear them into little bit if you like. If we can't stop the train, there'll be an accident with people killed. Now sticks, come on. - I'll have two. It was my idea. - They're our petticoats! What's it matter who waves what if we can only stop the train. Stand firm and wave like mad. Keep off the line, Bobbie. They won't see us. It's all no good. - Stand off the line, Bobbie. - It's all no good. - Stand back! - Not yet. Not yet! - Stop! - Stop! Stop! - Stand back. - Stop! Stop! - Stop! - Stop! Stop. Stop... Stop. Stop. There's been an earthquake. Don't move you'll all be killed. The trees are walking down the bank and there's a mountain of great stones. We'll have a look at this earthquake then get back to the train. Bobbie. Ladies and gentlemen, I think you'll agree with me that we have three charming children here who are indeed an example to us all. All right chaps, this is it. One, two, three. ...I have learned in the short time I have seen them to look forward to knowing them better. If I had to rename the Waterbury children, I would call them the Three Saviours of the Steel Road or perhaps the Railway Children. And now my dears, from the directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in grateful recognition of a courageous and brave action which averted an accident on August 15th, 1905. Oh, thank you. It's your turn now. Just begin with "Ladies and gentlemen". - Oh, lor! - No, "Ladies and gentlemen". Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, we shall treasure these watches for the rest of our lives. What I mean to say is, thank you all very much indeed. One, two. You must be very proud, Mrs Waterbury. And er, this is from me. It was a wonderful day, wasn't it? The kind that very seldom happens. But I did so want to talk to the old gentleman about something else. What did you want to say to him? I'll tell you, I've written him a letter. "My dearest old gentleman, I want to ask you something, please. "If you get out of the train and go by the next it would do. "I do not want you to give me anything - Mother says we ought not to. "Besides, we only want to talk to you about a prisoner and captive. "Your loving friend, Bobbie. " Very good. Yes, it is. My heart's thumping like a steam engine, right under my sash, too. People's hearts aren't under their sashes. I don't care, mine is. If you're going to talk like a poetry book, my heart's in my mouth. My heart's in my boots if it comes to that. - He'll think we're idiots. - He won't be far wrong. Oakworth! - Morning, sir. - Good morning, Perks. - Hello. This is a very great pleasure. - It was good of you to get out. Er, may I extend a cordial invitation to the use of my room, sir? - Thank you. - Right away, sir. - Right away, Mr Mitchell. - Thank you, Mr Perks. If you'd care to follow me, sir just along here. - Nice and tidy for you sir. - Ah, thank you, Perks. - I'll leave you to it then, sir. - Thank you. Well? Well? What is it? - Oh, please... - Yes? - What I mean to say is... - Yes? - I wish I might say something. - I wish you would say something. Well then... it's about our Russian. - Captive. - A captive. We want more than anything in the world to find his wife and children for him. Only we don't know how. - What did you say his name was? - I'll write it for you. Um, would you have a pencil and the back of an envelope? Here, write it here. This is how you write it. You say... Szczepansky. That man? Bless my soul... I've read his book. So your mother took him in like the good Samaritan. I'll tell you what, youngsters, your mother must be a very good woman. - Yes, she is. - And you're a good man. You flatter me. Now am I to tell you what I think of you? - Oh, please don't. - Why? I don't know why exactly, only if it's something horrid I don't want you to. And if it's something nice I'd rather you didn't. Then all I will say is that I'm very glad you came to me about all this, very glad indeed. And I shouldn't be surprised if I don't find out something very soon. Well now tell me something about yourselves. Tea first. Who on earth? Let's go and see. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Good news, my dears. I've found your Russian friend's wife and children. - Oh! - And I couldn't resist the temptation of having the pleasure of telling him No, you tell him, my dear. And the other two will show me the way. Mother, Mr Szczepansky's wife and children have been found. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. - Right away, Mr Mitchell. - Thank you, Mr Perks. Goodbye. Excellent. - Bye. - Goodbye. Ah! There, that's a likely little brooch that. I don't know as ever I seen a thing more like a buttercup, without it were a buttercup. Mother gave it to me for my birthday. Oh, is that it? I didn't see it close to. It highly decorative that, thank you. - When's your birthday, Mr Perks? - My birthday? I gave up keeping my birthday afore you lot were born. But you must have been born sometime, you know. Even if it was 20 years ago or 30 years ago or 60 or 70. Yeah, well it weren't quite so long as that. If you really want to know, it's my 42 years come the 15th of this month. Why don't you keep it then? I've got other things to keep besides birthdays. Oh what? Not secrets, Mr Perks. No, the kids and bloomin' missus. I've sold another story, darlings, the one about the King of the Mussels so there'll be buns for tea. You can go and got them the moment they're ready. Would you mind if we didn't them tonight, but on the 15th? That's next Thursday. I don't mind, darling, but why? Well, it's Mr Perks' birthday, he's 42. He says he doesn't keep his birthday any more, he's got other things to keep. Not rabbits and secrets, but the kids and the bloomin' missus. - His wife and children, Bobbie. - It's the same thing, isn't it? Bloomin' missus is sort of a germ of endearment, isn't it? - Term of endearment, Phyl. - Yes. We thought we'd make a nice birthday for him. He's been very nice to us. And we agreed that next bun day we'd ask if we could. It would be rather nice to write his name on the buns in pink sugar, wouldn't it? - Perks isn't a very pretty name. - Albert's his other name, I asked once. I think Albert's a pretty name. What's the matter with that? What about flowers? He's got lots of flowers of his own, hasn't he? Yes, but it's always nice to be given them. Let's all just sit and think. No one's to speak until they've thought of something. - I've got it. - What? - Perks is so nice to everyone, right? - Right. So there must be lots of people who'd like to help make him a birthday. Mother said we weren't to ask people for things. For ourselves, she meant, not for other people. I think we should ask Mummy first. There's no harm in it, it depends how you do it. I only hope Mr Perks won't be offended and think it's charity. Poor people can be very proud, you know. It's not because he's poor, it's because we're fond of him. All right, I'll look out some things that Phyllis has outgrown. - Will that do? - I'm sure he'd love that. Come back tomorrow and I'll see what I can do. - Oh, thank you, goodbye. - Goodbye. Thank you, bye bye. I've always liked Mrs Ransome. - Oh, thank you. - Of course. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Bye! Some people were kind and some were crusty and some would give some would not. It's Mr Perks' birthday on Thursday, would you like to give him a present? - No, I would not. I hate the man. - Thank you! That was pretty rude. It's rather difficult work asking for things, even for other people. as you've no doubt found if you've ever tried it. Tobacco pipe, half a pound of tea. - Woollen scarf from the Drapers. - A stuffed squirrel from Doctor Forrest. There it is, you can have it and good riddance to it. - Oh! - Thank you. - Bye. - Goodbye. Thank you, Mr James, he'll love that. Goodbye. Hello? Hello, is anyone at home? Me Mam's upstairs, a- changing herself. Mam, visitors! Thank you Patrick, just coming. I'm a bit late changing, Miss, owing to me having had an extra clean up today along with Perks happening to say it's his birthday. I don't know what put such an idea into his head. We keeps the children's birthdays, of course, but him and me... Well, we've no time for suchlike as a general rule. We know it was his birthday and we've brought him some presents. Oh, bring them in my dears. Oh, don't, please don't, Mrs Perks. Whatever is the matter? Do you mean to say you don't like the things we brought? Don't you like them? Oh, there, there, don't mind me, I'm all right. Like them? Why it's a birthday such as Perks never had, not even when he were a boy. Good, I'm glad you're pleased. Could we wait and see if Mr Perks is pleased too? I won't say another word. Could we have a plate for the buns, Mrs Perks? Oh, of course. Fit for a prince, I'd say. I never thought there'd be more for him, except the ounce of his backie. # I'm feeling right today # Been a lovely day... # Bless us, he's early. Let's hide in there and you tell him about it but give him the tobacco first as you got it for him. When you've told him, we'll shout "Many Happy Returns". - How do. - How do. Hello, old woman. - Well here's a pretty set out. - It's your birthday tea, Bert. And here's an ounce of your extra particular. Yes, she's a good old girl. Eh, what's that pram doing here? Hey, you're not...? Well, what's all these bundles? Eh? And what's all this sweet stuff and...? What's this squirrel doing on the table, eh? Oh, lor! Whatever should we do? I've forgotten to put the labels on any of the things. He won't know what's from whom. He'll think it's all from us and that we're trying to be grand and charitable or something horrid like that. Ssh, be quiet! I don't care. I won't stand it. I tell you straight. But, it's them children you make such a fuss about, the children from the Three Chimneys. I don't care, not if it was angels from heaven. We got on all right all these years and no favours asked. I'm not having these charity goings-on at my time of life. And don't you think it, Nell. Ssh, Bert, shut your silly tongue, for goodness sake. All three ofem is in the other room a- listening to every word you speaks. I'll give them something to listen to. I've spoke my mind to these afore and I'll do it again. Come out. Come on out! Out here, come on. No, not you lot, you stop in... Sophie, look put some pants on Benjamin, we've got company. Right, you can tell me what you mean by it. Have I ever complained of being short as you starts this charity with me? We thought you'd be so pleased, Mr Perks. I'll never try and be kind to anyone else as long as I live. - No, I won't. Not never! - We didn't mean any harm. It isn't what you means so much as what you does. We thought you'd love it. We always have things on our birthdays. Oh ay, from your own relations, that's different. No, not just our relations. They're from all sorts of people in the village. - And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know. - We did. So you've been telling the neighbours that we can't make both ends meet. Now you've disgraced us as deep as you can in the neighbourhood, you can take that pack of tricks back where it came from. I'm very much obliged, I'm sure. I don't doubt that you meant it kind but I'd rather not be acquainted with you any longer, if it's all the same to you. Look here. We'll go if you like and you needn't be friends with us any more, but... We'll always be friends with you, even though you're nasty to us. But before we go, let us show you these labels to put on the things. I don't want to see no labels except proper luggage labels in me own walk of life. - Please let Bobbie show you the labels. - All right, go on. We wrote down everything everybody said when they gave us the things with the people's names on. Because Mother said that we ought to be careful because... Well I wrote down what she said and you'll see. That's from Mother. She thought Mrs Perks might like some of Phyllis' things. "I can't do much... " Well that's all right. I mean, your ma's a born lady. We'll keep the little frocks and what-not, Nell. Yes, Albert. Then there's the perambulator and the gooseberries and sweets. They're from Mrs Ransome. I can't send the pram back, Bert, and I won't so don't ask me. I'm not asking anything. Then there's the shovel. Mr James made that for you himself and he says... Oh, where is it? Oh, yes, here. - No er, you can read it. - He says, "You tell Mr Perks it is a pleasure to make a little trifle for a man "as is so much respected. " He's a good chap, that. He's a very good chap, that. He's not bad at all, that chap. And everybody who gave anything said they liked you and thought it was a very good idea of ours. And nobody said anything about charity or anything horrid like that. We thought that you'd love to know how fond everybody is of you. And I've never so unhappy in all my born days. Goodbye. Come on. Stop! I take back every word I've said contrary to what you'd wish. - Nell? - Yes, Albert. Put the kettle on. We'll take away the things if you're unhappy with them. I'm not unhappy aboutem. I don't know if I was ever better pleased. ...Not so much with the presents though frankly they're an A. 1 collection but the kind respect of our neighbours. - That's worth having, eh Nell? - I think it's all worth having... And you've made a most ridiculous fuss about nothing, Bert, if you ask me. No, I haven't. If a man didn't respect himself, no one wouldn't do it for him. But everyone respects you. They all said so. We knew you'd like it once you understood. Well you'll stay to tea, I take it? May the garland of friendship be ever green. May our garland of friendship be ever green, Mr Perks. Hear, hear! Oh, well that's all right then, isn't it? Let's have a look at them buns you brought in. Where are they? Who wrote that? It's Albert. Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Now go to sleep all of you and not another word. - Good night. - Good night, Mum. Yeah they're jolly good little kids, those Waterburys. Oh, they're all right, bless their hearts. It's you that's the aggravatingest old thing that ever was. - I was ashamed of you, I tell you. - You needn't be. I climbed down handsome as soon as I understood it weren't charity. Charity's one thing I never could abide, and won't neither. - Go to sleep, Albert. - Yes, dear. I tell you this though, it isn't what you does so much as what you means, that's what I say. - Now if it had been charity... - Oh, drat charity, Bert. Nobody won't offer you charity however much you was to want it. That were just friendliness, that were. I reckon it's what people call loving kindness. - Now go to sleep, Bert. - Yes dear, good night. Good night, Bert. Happy Birthday. Nell? Oh, all right, Bert, as it's your birthday. Hello, my dears. Hard at it, are yer? Yeah. Well, er... Yeah. One good turn deserves another, that's what I always say. Hello, Mr Perks, how do mean? Well I found these magazines, you see, in the waiting room. I was cleaning up. They were in a cupboard and well they're only collecting dust and... Dust is, as you know, unhygienic. - Hello. - Hello. I thought perhaps you might like them. There's a lot of pictures inem. and that, and you can colourem up with chalks and that. Anyway I don't wantem. - You're a dear. - Yes, you are. - Hear, hear! - Well, that's all right then. I must be getting along. I've got lots to do. Perks must be about it. Thank you. That was very kind of him. We'd better go inside, it's going to rain. Daddy... - Where's Bobbie? - I thought I heard her upstairs. She knows it's tea time. I wonder if she's all right. Bobbie? What is it darling? Oh, Mummy! You don't believe Daddy did it? - No. - Because it's not true. They have shut him in prison, but he's done nothing wrong. He's good and honourable and he belongs to us. Will it make you very unhappy if you tell me all about it? I want to understand. Do you remember the day those two men took Daddy away? Yes, I do. Well they arrested him, charging him with selling State secrets with being, in fact, a spy and a traitor. How could anyone believe that? How could anyone do such a thing? Someone did. Why didn't you tell someone, a lawyer? There wasn't anyone who could hurt Daddy on purpose, was there? I don't know. It's all so complicated. There was a man in the office who was very envious of your father. Daddy always said he didn't quite trust him. Why didn't you explain all that to someone? No one would listen. Do you suppose I haven't tried everything? No, my darling, what we have to do, you and I, and Daddy, is to be brave. Where have you been? Where have I been? Down to the station. Don't ask why, it's a secret. Oh, please yourself. - There's a paper chase tomorrow. - Oh, whoopee! - Who? - The grammar school boys. Oh zippee! Perks says we can see them going along by the line. Oh really? What's a paper chase? Let me pass please Hey! That's against by-laws. - I ought to report him. - They're only having fun. Passengers is forbidden to cross the line on any pretence. He ain't no passenger. He's out of sight now, anyway. What the eye don't see the heart need take no notice of, that what I always say. Come on then. He's gone in the tunnel. Oh, it is dark in here. They don't know what they're in for. It isn't easy running in the dark. They'll take a long time going through, won't they? Aye, they will that. - They went that way. - Oh thanks! I know! Let's cut across to the top and see them come out the other end. - We'll be there before they are. - Good idea. Yes, good idea! - This way! - No, this way. Come on, quick. There, that's all. What should we do now? Not yet, there's one in a red jersey. He hasn't come out yet. Come on, let's go to the tunnel mouth and perhaps we can see him from the inside. It's dark in there. - Don't worry, Phyl. I'll protect you. - I don't like it. Still no sign of him. I reckon he must have had an accident. Let's go and rescue him. Come on. Come on, Phyl. Keep close behind me. If a train comes along get flat against the tunnel wall and hold your skirts against you. I still don't like it. - I want to go back. - Ssh, don't be silly. What is that? It's another earthquake! - It's a train. - Oh, let me go back! Don't be a coward, it's quite safe. Stand back. Come in, come on. It is a dragon. I always thought it was. Come on. Supposing that boy was caught underneath the train... - Oh! - We've got to go and see. Can't we go and get someone from the station? - Phyl, you wait here. - No. Hello? Hey you two, come quickly! Oh, is that blood? Is that red blood? - Is he all killed? - Phyllis, please. Hurry up you two, get help. "It was on a hot summer's afternoon... " Oh, do come down, we've found a hound in a red jersey and he's broken his leg. They're bringing him here, I've sent for Doctor Forrest. But you should send for a vet, I can't have a lame dog here. Oh, he's not a dog, it's a boy. Well then he ought to be taken to his mother. His mother's dead, his father's in Northumberland. Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him, won't you? I told him I was sure you'd want us to have him here. - You always want to help everybody. - Come along. I'm glad you brought him here. - Let's get him to bed. - It will hurt a bit, won't it? I hope you don't think I'm a coward if I faint again. I don't do this on purpose. I don't want to cause you any more trouble. Don't you worry, you're the one who's got the trouble. We'd love to have you here, wouldn't we, Bobbie? Yes. That will be Doctor Forrest. I'll go. - That's not the doctor. - I know. I know that voice though, at least I think I do. I thought I recognised it too. It's not the doctor, that's for sure. Could it be that Doctor Forrest has been attacked by highwaymen and left for dead and this is the man they've telegraphed - to take his place? - Perhaps he's gone mad. Perhaps he's caught something awful from one of his patients and that man's come to tell her. Nonsense. Mother wouldn't take the man up into Jim's bedroom. Why should she? Listen. The door's opening. Now they'll come down. It's rude to listen like this. It's not listening, nobody in their senses would talk secrets on the stairs. Bobbie? A relative of Jim's has come, he wants to see you. Wash your hands and faces. We'll be in the dining room when you're ready. Yes, Mama. There now! Fancy not thinking of that, hm? - Any hot water, Mrs Viney? - Righto love. You all right? There we are, that's it. Well I never did! This, my dears, is Jim's grandfather. Our own old gentleman! I'm so awfully glad it's you. When I just think of all the old gentlemen there are in the world it could have been anyone. You're not going to take Jim away though, are you? Not at present. Your mother has most kindly consented to let him stay here. I thought of sending a nurse but your mother said she'd nurse him herself. But we won't have anything to eat if Mother doesn't write. That's all right, Peter. I see you trust your children. - Of course. - Then I may tell them our arrangement. Sit down, my dears. Your Mother, my dears, has consented to give up her writing for a while and to become a matron of my hospital. Does that mean we'll have to leave Three Chimneys and the railways? No, no, my darling. No. The hospital is here. The Three Chimneys Hospital and my unlucky Jim is the only patient. - Will Mother go on writing again? - We shall see... Perhaps something nice will happen and she won't have to. - But I like my writing. - I know. Don't be afraid I'm going to try and interfere but one never know. Very beautiful and wonderful things do happen, don't they? And we live most of our lives in the hope of them. I got your letter my dear, but it wasn't needed. When I read about your father's case in the papers at the time I had my doubts. And ever since I've known who you were, I've been trying to find out things and I have hopes. - Oh... - Yes, I may say, great hopes. But keep your secret for a little while longer. Wouldn't do to upset your mother with a false hope, would it? But it isn't false. I know you can do it. I knew you could when I wrote. It isn't false hope, is it? No, my dear. You don't believe Daddy did it? Oh, say you don't believe he did. My dear, I'm perfectly certain he didn't. Life at Three Chimneys was never quite the same again after the old gentleman came to see us. Oh, please Phyllis. The house became a hospital. I give you three guesses who that is. Is everything all right? Good luck. I'll curtain up. Have you... Have you noticed the ship is sinking? Yes I know, but don't blame me. Oh, no! Oh, no they'll all get so wet. You'll need some light on the subject. As your solicitor I must advise you. Don't worry. Don't worry, I've managed to get most of the survivors. Right, curtain down. Thank you, good evening. I hope you enjoyed it. Children, will you please be quiet. Oh, the blood! - Oh, is it over? - Oh, thank goodness. - Oh, you are a good doctor. - Can I have that please? There we are. How's that? - Cheerio. - Bye. Jim's leg got better and he went home. - Right away, Mr Mitchell. - Thank you, Mr Perks. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye, I'll write. - Lor lummy, Pete! - They'll have to marry now! Lummy. We seemed to be hardly Railway Children at all in those days and as the days went on each of us had an uneasy feeling about this which Phyllis expressed one day. I wonder if the railway misses us. We never go and see it now. It seems ungrateful. We loved it so when we hadn't anyone to play with. The thing I don't like is our having stopped waving to the 9:15 and sending our love to Father by it. Let's begin again tomorrow. Hurry up, Fatty, for goodness sake. I can't, my bootlace is undone. When you marry your laces will come undone going up the aisle and the man that you marry will tumble over and smash his nose in. I'd rather marry a man with a smashed in nose than not marry at all. - Take our love to Father! - Take our love to Father! Most extraordinary! - Most extraordinary. - Extraordinary indeed. Now, Bobbie, I wonder whether you could... Don't you feel well? I don't know. I don't know how I feel... Will you let me off lessons today? I feel as if I want to be quite alone, by myself. Of course I'll let you off. What is it? You don't feel ill, do you? No, not ill. I've just got to be alone, do you know? Mm, sometimes Roberta, you're so like me. I'll be more alive in the garden. - Morning, Miss, I'm sure. - Good luck, Miss Roberta. Thank you. Hello. Look, if this is the train, it'll be smart work. Bless you. I seen it in the paper. I was never so pleased in all my born days. One I most have and no offence I know on a day like this. And one for luck. You ain't offended, are you? I haven't taken too great a liberty, have I, on a day like this, you know. - No, Mr Perks, of course it's not a liberty. - No. Dear Mr Perks, we love you quite as much as if you were an uncle of our own but on a day like what? Well like thisere. I told you, I seen it in the papers, didn't I? Saw what in the papers? Oakworth! Oakworth Station. Oakworth. There we are. Thank you, Madam. Yes, thank you. Quick as you can, please. Oakworth Station. - Right away, Mr Cryer. - Thank you, Mr Perks. Daddy, my Daddy! I think just now we're not wanted there. Not for a few minutes anyway. I think it would best for us to go quickly and quietly. We'll go to the end of the field among the thin gold spikes of grass. We may just take one last look over our shoulders, at the house where neither we nor anyone else is wanted now. - Bye. - Bye, bye. Hope you loved it. Goodbye.
