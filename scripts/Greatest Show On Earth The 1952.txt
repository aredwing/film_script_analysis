The pied piper, whose magic tunes lead children of all ages, from 6 to 60, into a tinsel and spun-candy world of reckless beauty and mounting laughter, whirling thrills, the rhythm, excitement and grace of daring and blaring and dance, of high-stepping horses and high-flying stars. But behind all this, the circus is a massive machine whose very life depends on discipline, motion and speed. A mechanized army on wheels that rolls over any obstacle in its path, that meets calamity again and again, but always comes up smiling. A place where disaster and tragedy stalk the big top, haunt the backyard and ride the circus train, where death is constantly watching for one frayed rope, one weak link, or one trace of fear. A fierce, primitive fighting force that smashes relentlessly forward against impossible odds, that is the circus. And this is the story of the biggest of the big tops and of the men and women who fight to make it the greatest show on earth. - Morning, Mr Braden. - Morning, Nick. - When's the new hor'se arriving, Brad? - Tomorrow, Chuck. Dont rub them thin, Jimmy. Tho'se bell's are 60 year's old. Theyve rung in 'some good 'show's. - Hi. - Hi, Mr Braden. How are the kid's? Oh, ju'st fine, except they were playing with Randy Concello a few day's ago. That's nice. Ye's, but Randy came down with the mump's thi's morning. What? No. Any 'sign's? No, not yet, but baby gorilla's do get the mump's. Ill have Higgin's give them a 'shot of immune 'serum and double their cod liver oil. Give them plenty of 'spinach. You 'stay healthy now, boy, you hear? Say, i's it true were only gonna play a 'short 'sea'son thi's year? Dont believe all you hear. - See? - Go back to Mama now. I told you there wa's nothing to it. - How's Myrtle? - Stomach. Give her 'some gin and ginger. - Any new's about a full 'sea'son? - Youll get a full 'sea'son. Be 'sure Myrtle get's all the gin. - Same old trouble? - Yeah. Sore throat. All of it. Well, get a billiard cue and 'swab it out. Better feed your bird, Lou. Hey, Brad, Betty in the cookhou'se 'said were only gonna play the big citie's thi's year. And then clo'se up like a mi'ser's heart. Well, if theyre giving odd's, bet a buck for me. Why the rehear'sal ju'st for makeup, Brad? Becau'se you left off your eyela'she's la'st performance la'st 'sea'son. Youre gonna need an extra 'shoe walking back from Kalamazoo. Im 'suppo'sed to be looking for you, Brad. Well, are you 'suppo'sed to find me? Big bra's's hollering for you up front. You found me. Hey, Brad, thi's might help. Too 'small. Skim off the cream. Let the little 'show's 'scramble for the thin milk. Dont forget what circu's day mean's to a 'small town. John North, youre ju'st 'soft about the circu's. It's 'suicide to play thi's whole tour thi's year. - You gonna tell that to Brad? - Ye's. A good circu's bo's's carrie's out order's. My vote i's 10 week's and back to Sara'sota. But for 80 year's... That order about keeping the ground's clean goe's for the top bra's's, too. - Hi, Brad. Im 'sorry about that. - Good morning. Ive 'seen happier head's on cane's. We 'sent for you, Brad, to tell you weve got to pa's's up the 'small citie's and town's. - Time's have changed. - Kid's havent. - Price's have. - Well 'stay in the black. You hope. Look, Brad, here's the tour for thi's 'sea'son. That's only 10 week's. Sixty percent of our money come's from the big citie's in the fir'st 10 week's. The world's up'side down, Brad. We cant take the ri'sk... Our people ri'sk their neck's twice a day. Well have a 'short 'sea'son, no red ink and no trouble. Trouble's part of the circu's. They 'said Barnum wa's in trouble when he lo'st Tom Thumb. They 'said he wa's through when Jumbo died. Were the greate'st 'show on earth, and you cant put 1,400 people out of work becau'se the world ha's a 'stomach ache. And you cant ri'sk $25,000 a day on a 'sentimental journey, either. If youll play only the big citie's, youll cut the heart right out of thi's 'show. In two 'sea'son's, youll de'stroy what it took hi's family 80 year's to build. I might vote a few week's more if we had a bigger headline. - Holly i'snt known. - Well, weve got one. - Didnt you tell him, John? - Not yet. Who i's it, Johnny? Have you brought Gargantua back to life? The Great Seba'stian. - What? - Oh, no! Obviou'sly, youre crazy. Seba'stian's wrecked every 'show he's been with. - But he draw's like 'sugar in fly time. - Nobody can handle him. - He's never worked for Brad. - Youre buying trouble, Johnny. Im buying the be'st trapeze act in the air. Well, he may be a god in the air, but he's a devil on the ground. You mean with women? Do you know how many women thi's 'show carrie's? He's not that good, no matter what youve heard. - Thing's are bad enough a's it i's. - No, Brad, it's too big a gamble. You havent 'sold me. Im 'still again'st going under canva's. - Are you for Seba'stian? - Ye's. Becau'se the only way we could get him wa's to 'sign him for the full 'sea'son. I knew there wa's a trick in it. You cant get good act's for a 10-week 'sea'son! Cool off, Brad. Were going to 'stay out a's long a's were in the black. Agreed? - A's long a's we make money, ye's. - Lf you 'say 'so, John. Well, I dont like it, John. Thank you, gentlemen. That's it. And youd better 'start worrying about Seba'stian. - Let me 'show you... - You try to give... I cant believe it. Hey, Lucky, keep tho'se cat's covered when you move them. Okay, Mr Braden. - Brad? - Yeah? You know Seba'stian only work's in the centre ring. I know it. Id rather crawl in that cage of cat's than have to tell Holly 'she's out of the centre ring. So would I. You can blame me if you want to. Thank's, but it's my medicine. Ill take it. Come on, boy. Come on. Hey, Tuffy, off your back and on your toe's. And give me a little more 'slack thi's time. You got ample rope now for a hanging. One more and lm going to do without the mechanic. No deal. Ill put up a net. What do you think I am, a fi'sh? You better u'se a net for thi's one, or youll break your neck, and Brad will break mine. Now dont get 'sentimental, Tuffy. Come on, let's go. If Brad 'see's thi's, hell chew your ear's off. Snap your leg's now. All the way together, Lena. Point your toe's, Janet. A little more curve. Relax, relax. - Any new's? - Nope. Come on, now. Let's get over it. Fa'ster, Loni, fa'ster. What give's, Button's? Holly's hatched up a new hair-rai'ser for that centre 'spot. Quiet around the centre ring! Everybody, 'still a minute, plea'se! Time... Terrific, Holly! Pretty good. Hi, Brad. Do you like it? You try it again and III ground you. It's the fini'sh on my new act. Itll fini'sh you and your act. Dont you want to 'see it once more? No. Come on down. Okay, youre the bo's's. Watch it, Tuffy. Here I come. - Oh, brother. - Hey, look it. - Down on 'second's. - Put it in the act, Holly. That ankle drop i's out. I want you all in one piece. That's for making the big bra's's give u's a full 'sea'son. You got that trapeze wired for 'sound, pigeon? But youre the kind of fellow who could talk anybody into anything. - You did, didnt you? - Yeah. Hey, kid's, Brad fixed it. Were gonna play the full 'sea'son! Come on! Did you hear that, Klau's? The full 'sea'son! Down, move down. Make him put me down, Klau's. Why? Do I have to have an excu'se to leave the room? You know, I think it i's the trou'ser's. Wherever there are trou'ser's, you go. - Full 'sea'son, Loni. - Oh! He filled it. The full 'sea'son will buy me a 'sable-dyed rabbit coat. What you have on, I like. Well, 'sugar, like it a little farther away. - No layoff, Buzzy! - Tell him, Dai'sy. Were hitting the 'stick's. Terrific. Okay... A full 'sea'son, i'snt that 'swell? Youre wonderful! All right, quiet down, everybody. Quiet down! Now, li'sten, and get thi's, all of you. We only 'stay out a's long a's were in the black. Well be in the black, right? You mean we all got to play in blackface? - And Seba'stian, too! - Seba'stian? - Seba'stian? - Seba'stian? - Oh, no, he's not. - Lock up the girl's. Aint he in Europe? - Oh, boy, wait till you 'see him. - Who did you 'say? Well, I dont know, but I heard that The Great Seba'stian's coming. I's that true, Brad? New's 'sure travel's fa'st around here. He's 'strictly centre ring, i'snt he? That's right. - Hi. Aint it great? - Terrific. Oh, boy! Do you know what thi's i's? Well, 'sure. It's my iron-jaw mouthpiece. Why? Put it in your gabby mouth and keep it 'shut. - Whered you leave the prop's? - Right over here. He can take care of u's now. All right. Get your bit's, girl's. You, too, Philip. Well, I gue's's I know where I 'stand. - Holly, li'sten... - To what? More promi'se's about next year, the year after that? I wa's a fool to believe you. Youd 'sell out your own grandmother for a name act. - You know there's nobody... - Dont 'say youre 'sorry. I couldnt take that. Im 'sorry there's only one centre ring. Oh, 'sure. I know. The 'show come's fir'st. I didnt want to do thi's. Save your breath. I know ju'st what youre gonna 'say. Oh, Brad, I had the centre ring. You told me I could have it. Holly, you want the 'show to play the road, dont you? I worked in every act in thi's circu's. Im in 'spec, lm in manage, lm a ro'se on the beauty float, I fill in with the flyer's. I work from 'start to fini'sh. Well, 'so do mo'st of the other's. It wa's the only way to get a full 'sea'son. But my own act, the one thing that's really mine, that lve worked on for three year's, that you to's's right out of the centre ring. Pigeon, look, youre the be'st trapeze act in the 'show. - Then why dont you leave me in centre? - Becau'se Seba'stian's a bigger draw. Brad, III draw them. Leave me there. Seba'stian's 'sure. Youre a chance. You dont take chance's with the 'show, do you? No. All right. Ill move over. Where do I go? Ring one. Oh, Brad, Id do my act in clown alley or the hor'se top for you. Id do anything if it wa's ju'st for you. Pigeon, look, out under the 'sky, you know how I feel about you. But under the big top, one performer's ju'st like another to me. Youve got nothing but 'sawdu'st in your vein's. Ive 'scraped too many of you kinker's up from the 'sawdu'st to let anybody get under my 'skin. Ju'st 'so the 'show roll's. You dont care who it roll's over or who it hurt's. So it roll's over me. Be careful 'someday it doe'snt roll over you. Dont worry. Ill have my rigging out of centre before The Great Seba'stian arrive's. - Tuffy, tear down my rigging. - Okay. Like peanut's, Harry? I got everything lined up, Mr Hender'son. Gaff wheel's, noveltie's for 'sucker bait, and two of the be'st 'stickmen in the racket's. Ill work it ju'st like the Columbia 'show. No, Harry, you got a tough guy here you didnt have at Columbia. Brad Braden? III handle him. With your brain's, you couldnt handle that hippo. Li'sten, if Braden get's in my way, III roll right over him. Hed break you in two. Not with you backing me, Mr Hender'son. He's too 'smart to tangle with your boy's. Ill cut him in, maybe. You cant buy men like Braden. And dont meet him head-on. Okay, III go around him. Great. What about the bankroll for the game's? Have 'some more peanut's, Harry. Peanut's? Hi, potato. Getting ready to roll? What's the potato gag? - Here, wrap that for me, will you? - Okay. Well, there's ma'shed potatoe's and ha'shed potatoe's, 'sweet potatoe's. I dont feel very 'sweet, except maybe about you. Youre alway's helping everybody, Button's. - Brad a'sked me to help you. - Wa's he 'sorry about it? Maybe he wa's ju'st worried I wouldnt have my rigging down before The Great Seba'stian arrive's. Could be. Could be. He doe'snt con'sider anybody's feeling's when it come's to running the circu's. Youre telling me. Im 'so mad I could 'spit. Well, why dont you 'spit then? You know, Brad's not a man, he's a machine, like the tractor's and the generator's. Why, Button's, I thought you were hi's friend. Well, he broke hi's word to you. You could never tru'st him again. That i'snt true! Brad's been worried 'sick about getting u's all a full 'sea'son. If he had to throw me out, he had to throw me out and it's... You didnt mean any of what you ju'st 'said. I made you 'see it hi's way a little, didnt I? Darn you. - You make me feel like a big idiot. - Yeah, well, 'stop acting like one then. Well, anyway, lm 'still mad at him. And lm mad at you, too. Say, that's pretty neat. Remind's me of a bandage I wore once when I 'sprained my ankle. Button's, why can Brad hurt me 'so? Why do I alway's want to hurt him back? They 'say each man kill's the thing he love's. A coward doe's it with a ki's's, a brave man with a 'sword. Why, that's crazy. You wouldnt hurt anyone you loved. Who know's what a man will do when he's in love? Every girl in the 'show ha's tried for you. But I gue's's you already have 'someone, huh? Could be. I's 'she in one of the town's were gonna play? I havent 'seen the route 'sheet. I's that why you dont try to romance any of the gal's? No. Clown's are funny people, Holly. They only love once. All men arent that way even if they act like clown's. No, I 'suppo'se not. Oh, Button's, lm all ache in'side, having a man love 'sawdu'st more than me. Well, maybe hell have to make a choice 'someday. Choice? If ever lm in hi's arm's, hi's head will be in the machine 'shop - or bedding down the hippopotamu's. - Yeah. Youre lucky. Everybody love's you. Ten million kid's and your girl. Youll be 'seeing her pretty 'soon. We roll in three day's. Yeah. Yeah. Into the sunshine of spring, the circus rises from its winter hibernation, spick-and-span, and ready for eight months of excitement and adventure. The circus trains, like Noahs Ark, will carry and shelter man and beast through flood and mud and heat and storm, through triumph and adversity. each sure the season will bring his hearts desire. - You dropped 'something! - Hey, look out, look out. Why dont you drive where youre looking? I wi'sh one of your dog's would bite you. All right, boy's! Come on. All right. Keep it coming. Keeping it coming. That's right. Keep it coming. Get tight in front of tho'se wheel's. Cant locate Seba'stian. Tried the ho'spital's, the hotel's. Straighten that wagon out! Come on! Get with it! We pull out in a half an hour whether he's aboard or not. Check both railroad 'station's and... - Who's that? - Seba'stian, I gue's's. - Hi, Seba'stian. - Hello! Get a load of that. Where's the fire at? Oh, baby! Thi's ought to be good. Where i's the bo's's man? I thought he wa's. I am Seba'stian. I am honoured to be with you. I hope your act's a's good a's your entrance. Ive 'seen them all arrive, Caldona, The Concello's, none of them ever came with a funeral e'scort. The police e'scort, it wa's not my idea. - I clocked him at 75 in a 15-mile zone. - Running a red light. I got him for cutting in and out of traffic on the wrong 'side of the highway. In the war, I drive a tank. Sometime's I forget. I forgot. Yeah, well, the judge will add that up to about $100 or 60 day's. $100? Then itll be 60 day's in jail. I would hate to be ab'sent the fir'st two month's of the 'show. Okay, boy's. Ill buy him back. Take my jeep, Law'son. Settle it in the office. Get your baggage aboard. You can park that heap in the menagerie hou'se. I 'salute you. We 'shall get along together 'splendidly. Hey! Dont crowd, mi'ster. Cant you 'see an elephant, or do I have to paint her red? I wa's blinded by the memory of an unforgettable night in Pari's. Blow up your water wing's, girl's. Here come's the big wave. Come on, Ruth. How come no hu'sband ever 'shot you? I never offer a 'sitting target. I thought Id 'seen the la'st of you when you got mixed up with that wirewalker from Li'sbon. You will never 'see the la'st of me, Angel. Angel! That will be arranged when you meet Klau's. Angel! Seba'stian! - Hello, hand'some. Remember? - Natalia! - No, honey ball, Phylli's. - Of cour'se. Lovely Phylli's with the charming iron jaw. Well, lm 'still hanging on to my job with it. All right. It 'save's your feet. Sure tough on your clothe's, though. Thank's for the ride, 'sugar. You know Seba'stian, eh? - Sure, were old friend's. - How good friend's? Li'sten, you can worry about any other guy in the 'show, but not Seba'stian. I wouldnt want him if he were dipped in gold du'st. We will make beautiful mu'sic together, huh? Yeah, the la'st time, I remember a few 'sour note's. Oh, Natalia wa's... Who i's that? They threw me off the ball team becau'se I wa's catching home run's at 'second ba'se. Say, how come the Giant's pa's'sed you up? I dont know. Oh, that's the giant and the fat boy. No, no. In between. - Oh, that's Holly. - Holly? She's intere'sting. I wouldnt meet her ju'st now if I were you. - Youre poi'son. - Why? - You ju'st put her out of the centre ring. - I did? Excu'se me. Mu'sic. - Well, here we go again. - Did you bring any card's? - Oh, my feet are killing me. - Well, then, keep off of mine. Pardon. I's it true what Phylli's ha's told me? - I wouldnt know. - Pardon. Wait a minute! That they put you out of the centre ring for me? I am Seba'stian. - You mean you didnt know? - How could I? - I am very, very 'sorry. - Ill get over it. If youre half a's good in the air a's you look on the ground, you are at lea'st terrific. The bo's's 'seem's to have other idea's. Say, they tell me that you work with two bar's like I do. No. You work with two bar's like I do. Anyway, lm glad to meet you. It mean's 'so much to you, the centre ring? - Dont be funny. - Excu'se me. Would you hold the'se, plea'se? - Oh, ye's, Seba'stian. - Thank you. - Come. - Where? - To 'see the bo's's. - What for? I will in'si'st he put you right back again. You arent kidding me, are you? - Come and 'see. - Oh, boy, will I! Keep going. Thi's i'snt a parking lot. That wa's a beautiful doll you made for Si's'sy. Im glad 'she liked it. Hello, Holly. Oh, Button's! I want you to meet The Great Seba'stian. Thi's i's Button's. Youll love him. Everybody doe's. Come on. - Why are you in makeup? - Why are you The Great Seba'stian? Get tho'se run's in, and were about through. Mr Braden, weve got trouble, - Yeah, we cant get Tiny aboard. - Cant even get him through the door. Go along with Lotu's. Theyll make you comfortable in her car. That hippo? She might get hungry. Dont worry. She's a vegetarian. Brad! Brad! Seba'stian's got 'something to tell you. Better tie him in 'so he wont roll! Ha's he? You know what? He want's to give up the centre ring to me. I'snt he wonderful? Yeah. Wonderful. Where do you propo'se to go? I have had the centre ring. To me, it doe's not matter. Ring one or ring three, a's you wi'sh. He really mean's it, Brad. He's not ju'st grand'standing. - Holly... - Oh, Brad. Ive wanted that ring ever 'since lve been a foot high. Do you know what were paying Seba'stian? You know how hi's billing read's? He's the 'star of the 'show. And the 'star reque'st's ring three. Who do you think youre kidding? Lm 'sorry, Holly, but the people watch the 'star. That's why the 'star play's the centre ring. The people watch the 'star, do they? Well, theyre going to be watching me. If you wont let him give me the centre ring, III take it away from him. Oh, no, ma chrie. I may give it away, but no one will take it away. Look, Seba'stian. Youre a nice guy, and I hate to do thi's to you, but lm going to make ring one the centre ring. If you do 'something once, III do it twice. If you do a double, III do a triple. If you 'stand on your head, III 'stand on my ear. Not while lm around, you wont. The one place youre not around i's 40 feet 'straight up. Maybe that's why I like it there. Im warning you, the audience's are going to be looking at me. And 'so will I. You 'start any trouble, and III ground you both. Hello, Brad. Were here to ble's's the circu's train's again. It's good to 'see you, Father. Could you pour it on a little extra heavy thi's time? - Of cour'se we can. - I think were going to need it. All right, boy's. Rai'se that run up and get it in. Even. Loading. Hurry it up, little Jim! - Give me your hand. - Dont fall, now. Oh, boy! Bye. See you in Wa'shington. Bye, Father! Bye, Father. ...one of the featured attractions of the greatest show on earth. Come right on in. Lets everybody go. ...boy's and girl's... She's going to 'swallow fir'st thi's curved 'sword, and you will notice that 'she ha's to twi'st her body in order that the 'sword can go down her curved neck. Do you think it's 'sharp? Children of all age's! John Ringling North welcome's you to the greate'st 'show on earth. Brainy bruin's with new idea's. Himalayan, Ru's'sian, Syrian and polar bear's. Sleek and 'shining a's 'silver dollar's, Roland Tiebor's marvellou's, amazing, 'sophi'sticated 'sea lion's. The internationally famou's riding canine! He did it, Mama! Back, boy! Foot! Foot! Foot! Foot! That foot's pretty rough to go in a girl's face. - File it. - All right. Hey, the duel or whatever you call it for the centre ring, Mr Braden? Yeah? What about it? I hear theyre 'slapping death in the face twice a day. The paper want's to know if it's on the level. Coming right on. Take a look. Ladie's and gentlemen, the 'sen'sation of the age's. In ring one, the beautiful bird of paradi'se, queen of the flying trapeze, the daring, the incredible, the death-defying, peerle's's and fearle's's Holly! And in the centre ring, the out'standing aerial daredevil of all time, the debonair king of the air, The Great Seba'stian! It 'sure pack's them in. Be'st publicity gag in a long time. It's no gag, brother. You wouldnt kid me, would you? Kid you? Theyre working without net's. Boy, look at that guy. Look at her! If they dont get killed. It's all done with mirror's, mi'ster. - Well, what are they going to do now? - Changing bar's. Should I whi'stle them down, Brad? Theyre changing their act. No. Leave them alone. Theyre doing all right. Okay. Youre the bo's's. Hey, Seba'stian, try it without the doughnut! How long do you think thi's can go on before 'something happen's? That's circu's, i'snt it? Do you believe in prayer? And practi'se. - What if one of them fall's? - Nobody's going to fall. Thi's i's packing them in every 'show. - We 'stay in the black or clo'se down. - Oh, 'stop talking 'so tough. You know, that i'snt the ba's's drum I hear thumping. That's your heart. You know... I know. Well, lve had enough. Well, that wa's a clo'se one. Well, are you ready to call it off? I have not 'started yet, but you were magnificent. - Sure 'stole it today, Holly. - Thank's, Bob. You two had quite a party up there, didnt you? Did you notice which ring they were looking at? If you really want to kill your'self, wait till the 'sea'son's over. Well, what do you know? He wa's worried about me. So wa's I. From here on, cut out the dogfight's up there and 'stick to your act's. Brad, dont be a killjoy. You dont know what it's like up there. It's a different world. Ju'st the two of u's fighting for the crowd. You feel like you could do anything. Were not people up there. Were like two 'streak's of light with wing's and... You wouldnt under'stand. - Nobody would, except another flyer. - Like Seba'stian? Yeah. Like Seba'stian. Come on, come on. We need people for the 'spec. - Did you watch the 'show? - Yeah. It wa's terrific! - McClo'sky want's you, Brad. - Okay. - Did you follow me? - Yeah. - That's not the half of it! - Plea'se go up to the co'stume... You and Seba'stian got an exclu'sive little club up there in the air? Get your'self a trapeze if you want to join. And dont park your chewing gum on the moon again, plea'se. Why dont he look at me anymore? Have I got too much or not enough? Dont worry, 'sugar. Hell get around to you. - Im hoping. - Maybe he wont. Did your elephant 'sit on thi's zipper? He 'say's were arti'st's up there together. Hed tell that to a trained 'seal if it paid off. Maybe he 'show's hi's bad 'side to you and hi's good 'side to me. Li'sten, Snow White, youre not fighting thi's guy, youre falling for him. He wa's good enough for you once. Maybe youd like to have him back. I wouldnt give Seba'stian the right time if Brad wa's a's nut's about me a's he i's about you. Brad? Are you kidding? I come fourth. After Ringling Bro's., Barnum and Bailey. Youre eating too many potatoe's. When Brad doe'snt come home night's, youll know the blonde he's 'sitting up with i's a giraffe. Hey, Holly, you trying to corner the market or ju'st 'starting a collection? - My... - Well, you only work with your teeth. Get with it, Mabel. Three minute's. So let's get it all on. Okay. If it were only you, 'sugar, Id let you ride the roller coa'ster all the way down. But lm thinking about Brad. Why do you want to bu'st up the 'swelle'st guy in the circu's? Sound's like youve got it bad. He's the only guy that look's at me that I dont know what he's thinking. He's thinking circu's. He ha'snt thought anything but circu's 'since he fell out of the cradle. But if you want him 'so bad, what's 'stopping you? Maybe becau'se I knew too many guy's like Seba'stian before I met Brad. Been around too much, huh? You havent been gathering any mo's's, either.

What could be more fitting for the Chri'stma's album than Adeste Fideles? The performance ends, but the drama never stops. In the grey, drizzly morning, the first section of the circus train pulls into the railroad yard, long before the city is awake. But the animals are awake and looking for their breakfast. Then comes the unloading. Two hundred tons of living power. Sixty carloads of equipment. Wheels rolling, gears grinding. A circus is gigantic power and unceasing movement. It is a restless giant, unlimbering its muscles after the long night ride before moving in to capture a new city. Up from the railroad yards with their faithful escort of early-rising young fans whove been waiting since daybreak to follow these living tanks as they lumber and sway to the circus grounds, where the stakes are being driven that will anchor the big top against the beating of its constant adversaries, wind and rain. An army is at work, an army the audience never sees. An army that must be moved from city to city, fed and housed, a thousand strong, hardworking men, moving like a finely-geared machine, with one purpose, to roll the show. The all-important baling ring clangs into place. Bales of fireproof canvas, are hauled out, unwrapped, rolled out, stretched, laid on the ground, where it lies like the skin of a mighty dismembered giant, waiting for some magician to bring it together and give it life, waiting until, one by one, the giants ribs rise into place and are firmly fastened in the earth. Boys line up for the punt games, a chance for a free ticket. The disciplined army never loses a moment nor wastes a motion. The boss canvas man makes fast the canvas to the baling ring. The lives of all depend on it. Each of the hundreds of roustabouts has his place and his job, a responsible job, for one mistake, one bit of carelessness, could cost a life. The giants skin is stretched out until it lies smooth and moulded, like the bowl of a great coliseum. But eyes watching for trouble have noticed a little tear that must be patched before the searching fingers of the wind can rip it into a disaster, before the giant can stand up and stretch over his feast of colour and laughter. Now the giant comes to life. Slowly, the tons and tons of his canvas body rise and swell into the air. He starts growing to his full, majestic height as he catches his first deep breath. The strong baling rings slipping along the great poles, until at last they reach to the flags flying from the peak. And as the big top rises in each town, new risks are taken. Caution is thrown to the winds in this battle for the centre ring. ...55, 56, 57, 58, I warned her not to do Jenny's act on that rigging. Yeah. I wa's there the night Jenny got killed. ...75, 76, 77, - Paying for the hay all in 'silver? - That's how we get paid.

Why didnt you put her over your knee and 'spank her? That would get 'some laugh's, too. Havent you got enough clown's, you got to make a comic out of her? - She wa's trying to break a record. - Shed have broken more than a record. You 'sure 'saved her a bu'ster.

Youre The Great Seba'stian. You wouldnt give up the centre ring for anything or anybody, unle's's you couldnt hold it. Youve been lying ever 'since you came in here. - Now let's 'see the truth. - Keep your hand's off... - You 'should not have done that. - That's why you wouldnt 'shake hand's. You werent going to Columbia. There wa'snt any girl from Pari's. You ju'st didnt want me to know... To know what Id done. No, no, no, chrie. You have done nothing. It i's life. No one i's to blame. - Cant 'something be done? - No. They have tried. May I have my coat, plea'se? There's a job for you in thi's 'show a's long a's you want it. One more cripple hanging on to the circu's? Watching other's flying through the air while I am crawling on the ground? You are meaning to be kind, bo's's man, but you and I both know it i's better that I go. Dont let him go, Brad! Holly, he's grounded for good. Hell go crazy if he 'stay's. - I did that to him. - No, he took the chance. I did it to him, a's 'surely a's if Id 'shot him. - You had nothing to do with it. - Oh, ye's, I did, Brad. I made him take that net down. I laughed at him. I razzed him into it. That's what made him take it down! You two crazy fool's. He wa's top's in the air. Now he's tied to a dead arm for the re'st of hi's life, a claw hand. - It wouldve been kinder if Id killed him. - Holly, thi's i's circu's. Brad, you cant reali'se what it mean's not to go up there again. Maybe I can. That's why it's better to let him go. - Lf he goe's, lm going with him. - Holly, dont be a fool! You 'saw the way he hid hi's arm, 'said thing's to make me hate him. He 'said them becau'se he didnt want me to know... To know that Id 'sma'shed him, 'sma'shed hi's whole life. He didnt want me to know becau'se he love's me. And lve got to make it up to him for what lve done. All right, you 'sma'shed him. Do you think 'sma'shing all three of u's will help him? You dont need me, Brad. Youve got what you love. Youve got the circu's. But what's he got? He's got gut's. That guy's tough. He doe'snt need 'sympathy. He can take thi's if you leave him alone. He doe'snt need pity. Im not going to give him pity. Im going to try and give him love. Yeah? All right. - What do you want? - To help you. I dont want any help. I dont need any help. You come here to cry over me, go 'somewhere el'se. I am packing. You dont even know where youre going. Be'side's, wherever it i's, what could you do that you couldnt do here with me to help you? What do think you could do for me? Well, I could fold thi's cape a little better. Oh, I 'see. Now lm a cripple. You would dre's's me, undre's's me, cut up my food, wait on me like a little child. No, thank you. If you want to be kind, plea'se go. I want to be with you, wherever you are. You are lying. You are 'sorry for me. You want to pay me becau'se you tea'sed me to cut down the net! That i'snt true. You fell in love with me when I wa's The Great Seba'stian, king in the air, a fla'sh of lightning in the centre ring. On the ground, it i's 'someone el'se you love. That's all over. Go back to the bo's's man. Dont think I am fini'shed becau'se of thi's. If I want 'someone, III a'sk her my'self. Women are no problem for me. I find them anywhere. You came back becau'se you love me. You would like to believe that, wouldnt you? It wa's for thi's I came back. - You did not. - My rig. Well, I can 'sell it anyway. You 'should be dre's'sing for the 'show. The applau'se, it i's all your's now. Youve got the centre ring. I cant take it away from you. I cant even applaud you properly. Say anything you like. Hit me if you want. - It wont change the way I feel. - Maybe I would like to hit you for lying. No one i's to blame but me. I... - Plea'se, I mu'st hurry. - Youre not going. Youre tied to the circu's, and whether you like it or not, youre tied to me. You think I would tie you to thi's? It wa'snt your arm I fell in love with. Or your hand. I fell in love with you.

When the lights go out on this glittering realm of sawdust and popcorn, the circus puts off its spangles and climbs into battle dress for the nightly combat with time and distance.

Yet out of this apparent chaos, these people bring tomorrows show, fresh and new and gay and hot, no matter how tangled the skein of their own lives may be. Ruth! Dont eat them new'spaper's!
