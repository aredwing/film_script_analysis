Saturday morning cartoons when I was a kid. Running into the ocean. Driving around on Saturday nights with Frankie. My first car, the badger. My mother's garden and her hands. She had beautiful hands. The freckle on the back of Emma's knee. That's the kind of thing to remember, that freckle. I will remember you. I will not forget you. Promise. Who are you? I-- I woke up with you. Uh... -Where? -Right here. No, no. I mean, where is this place? I uh, i don't know... i-- I was hoping you might know that. Um... I can't remember. I feel like i know you. Yeah, I know what you mean. You-- I just don't know how. How long have we been here? I don't know. It feels like the first day. But... We, um... look. We wanted to be together. What are you doing out here? What are you trying to say? Well, you better come with me then. Come on! Come on! This? This... This is a watch. Here... It tells the time. But it doesn't tell it. It can't talk. But see those numbers. Those are the time. And what's time? How can I explain it? Now. It's now. And now, it's now. See? Here. And now... It's now. And now... It's now. Now is now. And now is now. And now is now. So that's time. But what about space? Because they're always together so now we're here. And awhile ago... ...we were somewhere but soon we'll be there because now we're here. And now, we're here. And now, we're here. And now, we're here. And we will be... ...there. And now, is here. And now, is here. And now, is here. And now... Oh! Oh, hello there. What are you doing out here? Are you alone? Well, you better come with me then. I'll look out for you. Now stay close. Quiet, aren't you? Now, who gave you that? That's too big for you. Here, I'll hold on to that. Come on. Now, look at these. These are... ...windows. And they're all broken, broken... Look at that. Wait here. Oh, oh. - Good morning, Miranda. Ew, great. Are you ready for your self diagnostic memory test? Yes. What is your name? Miranda chan dowell. Where were you born? Singapore. What is your birthday? April 11. How long have you been in containment? 9 years, 276 days. Thank you, Miranda. Please pay close attention. Here is today's scenario. A family lives in a house that is three storeys tall. On the first floor in the dining room, the mother puts a red rose in a vase. On the second floor, in his bedroom, the son puts a green baseball cap on his head. On the third floor in the library, the daughter puts a blue book on the shelf. Where is the rose?

"Memory recall is improved when attempted in the same environment as the original memory trace." Yeah, that's good. How can I know that I don't know? Okay. So... Hmm. It's sweet. Hmm. Okay. I knew you were gonna do that. -Oh. -I knew, I knew the moment after you did it. -What? -That you were gonna tuck your hair behind your ear. -Oh. -I knew, I knew. I knew that you were gonna do that. What else do you know? - I don't know. -What am i gonna do next? I don't know but i-- i-- I know that i know somewhere. Afterwards, i know that I knew. I didn't know. Maybe we're family. Maybe I'm your brother. Come. Families look alike. Our eyes are different. Yeah, but our hair's the same. Look. Maybe... maybe we're married. Maybe. Fuzzy. Ha... Um... What do you think? I'm not sure. Let's... ...try it one more time. Hmm. - I guess we're together. I guess so. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. Hmm. Hmm. I-- I woke up this morning and I knew... I'd messed-- i knew I loved you. -But I was a bit confused. -Me, too. Me too! We have to go home. This... ...is home. Hmm. So what do you think, how long we've been together? I don't know. I don't even know your name. But I don't even know my own name. - Oh, I don't know my name either. - Bill. -Bill? - Bill. Bill. -No, not bill. -Bill. -No, no, no. - I refused to be called... Um... I... I love you... ...Ben! -Ben? -Ben. -Ben. -Ben. -Hm. That's better. -Ben. What's my name? Um... Hmm. -Jenny. -Jenny? -Yeah, you're Jenny. -Jenny. -Jenny. -Sounds weird. Oh, yeah, it's gonna sound weird. It always sounds weird when you say your own name. Jenny. Hmm. Jenny. Well, Jenny, let's at least see who else is here. -No, no, no. -Come on. No! I don't think we should. -Come on! -No. All these doors look the same. We'll get lost. No, no, no. We'll remember. -So says our blanket. -No, I think we'd get lost. Come on. --Lets go back. Okay. This place feels different. It feels the same to me. We should clean up. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This isn't where we live. -Why not? -We wouldn't live here. Look at this place. We must on our way to some place better. I know that we're trying to get somewhere else. I can feel it. What if there's no place better? I mean, this is good. It's... -It's safe. -You don't... You don't know that. How come there's no one else here? I mean, there's food. We're together. Yeah, but there's not much. Look, it won't last us long. If we don't find some place better, we'd come back. -Okay? -I don't know. We found this apartment again. We'll remember. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Mmm-hmm. -Trust me. -Here, hold it. -Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't matter. The longer it takes the more time it feels. I don't wanna be a piece in your museum. I don't have anything to tell you. I don't have anything new to tell you. I wish. Do you like this? You wanna play with it? I have so much more wonderful stuff inside. Come on! Come on, this is my house. You're gonna like it here. I've always been here. Ooh, this is mine. And this is mine. I was a queen. You're gonna like it here. Nothing bad has ever happened to me. You like it? Come on! Oh, there you go. There you go. Here. Like this. Would you like me to tell you a story? Once upon a time, there was a kingdom filled with people. And one day, all the people disappeared. Except for one girl. She searched everywhere for the rest of the people. She looked high and low and in between... And then, she found the people waiting for her in a house. And everyone was so happy. They had a party. And it was also her birthday. And everything was good from then on. The end. It's nice. - Oh yeah? -Yeah. Oh! Are you coming? Now you are coming. Wow! Come, it's amazing! That was really fun! Next song. Next song. Next song. Computer, stop. Play it back. Who built this? - It's beautiful. It makes me feel safe. I think... I think we've been here before. Maybe you're right. It makes me feel big inside. The light is all different colors in here. --It's magic. Oh look, it's blue. What is that? I don't know. What? Do you remember ever going to sleep before? No. No one remembers anything while they're asleep. I know. But I mean do you remember going to sleep? Do you remember where we slept last night? No. Do you remember where we slept the night before? No. I don't know. I don't know. But I know that we slept somewhere. If we don't ever-- if we don't ever remember going to sleep, if we go to sleep now, then... We won't remember anything when we wake up. It'll be like we're awake for the first time. Yeah, and we won't... ...remember each other. We can't ever go to sleep. Okay, okay. All right. -We'll just stay up together. -Yeah. -And never leave here. -Hmm-mm. Okay. -Stay awake with me. -We're not gonna forget. -Yes, we will. -We'll remember. -No, we won't. -I know we will. Yes, come on. -Don't say that. -How? -We will-- we'll have to stay awake. -Okay. It's okay. Who are you? Sticks again, mate. Have 'em for the fire. What do you want? Beat it! Go home. Go home! What's the problem? Oh, you're probably hungry. Fine! Don't touch anything. Hmm. I'm having some trouble this morning. My mind seems a little fuzzy. If you ask me, do I know how to chop wood, I couldn't tell you. But you put an axe in my hand, and I know how to chop wood. I don't know how I know, but I just know. Now, you don't touch this. This is not for boys, this is a man's job. Your job is to collect little sticks. This size. Don't wander too far away from the cabin. I don't even know your name yet. Me neither. How about... Hmm. How about... ...Mike? No, not Mike. Hmm... Max? -Max? -Yeah, Max. That sounds right. -Right? -Yeah. - Max! -What's your name? I don't know. Katie. -Katie? -Yeah. -Katie. -Yeah, you gotta be Katie. -Katie. -Max and Katie. -Katie. -Max, Max. -Max! -Katie. -Katie! Katie! -Max! Max! Ow! Ow! - What happened? - What happened? - Okay, I have to pull it out. - Okay? All right. -No, no. Wait. -You ready? --Okay, it's over. All right, okay. - It's okay. It's all right. It's over. All right. Okay. -It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. -No, no. Come on. -Let me look at it. Let me look at it. -It's okay, it's okay. --All right. It looks a little dirty. I need to get some water, okay? No, wait, wait! I wanna come! No, no, no. You have to stay right here. Don't move! --I'll be right back. --Come on, grab him! Get him! Get him! Hey, come on! Come on! -Gotcha! -Come on. Look at him! - No! - No! - Look at you. Come on! Come on. Don't stop. Hey! --Hey! Hey! Hey! -Dad? -Mmm-hmm? I don't wanna be here. Are you asking why we eat our meals together? No, I mean... I don't wanna be here in the bunker. I want us to leave. You've been saying the same thing since you were a child. I thought that you were all grown-up. Dad? Everyone left could be fine. We wouldn't know. --Oh. I can show you how to use that. Watch me! Let's see if i can still remember how to do this. Oh, my goodness! Here we go. Nothing to it! Okay. Now, it's your turn. All right. You throw your leg over the seat... Attaboy! Now, you put your hands on the handlebars like this, okay? Hands on the handlebars. There you go. - There you go. All right. Now, when you peddle, you gonna wanna go round in a circle like this, okay? Okay. Put your feet on the peddles. All right. --Ready to go? Here we go. All right. Miranda... Now, you won't get lost. By firing the same assembly of neurons as when we first experienced an event, we re-experience... This repetition of the neural patterns strengthens the synaptic connections and solidifies the memory trace. Retrace your steps. First step. Step one... Re-fire the neurons. But how? Fire the same neurons. How can I re-fire the neurons in the same pattern if I don't know what the pattern is? How many times have you done this? What is your name? Miranda chan dowell. Where were you born? Earth. Please respond again. Where were you born? Singapore. What is your birthday? April 11. How long have you been in containment? I don't feel like keeping track any more.
