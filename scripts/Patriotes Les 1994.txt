Why they send me such morons? OK, you're here to lie. But I must know who you are, to be able to grade you! I leave you a last chance. Be careful what you'll respond. Be careful. Your name is ?

So tell me, what's your name ? Your real name ? You can leave. OK, here's the exercise. We will refer you person. You're going to try to find out his name, address, profession. And many details as possible on his life. You must also get an appointment. You go about it as you want, we do not care. Provided he suspects nothing. Oh, that one. Go ahead. Warning, You have fifteen minutes. Afterward, you'll write us a report. And no lies! Excuse me, I thought. Sorry. Neither do I. But I work a lot with France. And you, what are you doing ?

In that case... Excuse us, there are a lot of pickpockets here. Ariel Brenner, an option is taken on him to unit 238. I'll file a complaint against you. I'm fed up your methods to the con. Ariel Brenner Assigned to the unit 238 Bernard Groner Unlisted A member of your family? An uncle ... Died. You thought he was with us? Not especially. The computer does not know everything. You are Ariel Brenner? Yes. Your mother is dead, right? Two years ago. Call me Yossi. It was you who led Munich team. That's what we said. Operation Moses, it's you too, right? It lends me many exploits. You have been assigned to the unit 238? The famous atomic unit! Warning ! What? You had dinner ? This is the most beautiful bunch of brutes this country has ever given. They have a motto: "Everything to prevent peace." Jewish ethics is not really their cup of tea. Why ? Jews should be better than others? Those draw no lesson tests we endured. They want to live in peace, that's all. God wanted to check the strength of the human soul. He said to the Jews, it's you that I will try. You will suffer and I'll see if you stay human. And in fact, he himself is that judge. He wants to check if his creation is not an error. Much is at stake for him. He is afraid, afraid of being mistaken. Afraid of his own bankruptcy through that of our people. I do not believe in God. I think random. That's all. I fight to defend me and to defend my land. There is no God. The land, it's nothing. It is sand. Well, tell me about Leopard. This is the code name a French engineer ... I know all that. Where are they? I do not know. Why do they not ask, their ? It's yours to account, right? Yes, but I like to check, especially with them. And if you, Mossad chief you do not know what your worst competitor, you will not stay long Mossad chief. I control. We can not control these people. Everything is arranged. I love Mr. Haydon. He is very direct in business. It is a real pleasure. We are friends. This is not too cold? No, it's perfect. Mr. Prieur, you know you have a fortune at your fingertips? Really ? Many countries are ready to pay very, very expensive ... beyond that you can imagine to acquire technology you are the expert. I imagine. My society sells nuclear power plants to countries that do not. For a course peaceful use. You never thought to take advantage of your knowledge? And if you work in collaboration with us ? You have the technology, we have contacts. You would be very well paid. It's interesting. You could start by keeping a record. Your plant project is an excellent prototype. Something displeases me in this story. Speaking ... It would bother me Haydon let out of it. Israel does not apologize. There will not be of holocaust in the history of the Jewish people. Never again. Never again. We managed to get us List of French personnel. Our analysts thought that Leopard had the right profile. Forties, married, no children. Questions ? What was based manipulation? Money, sex, ambition. They do not care about us. The bitch she belonged to the Mossad? No. The killing of Ahmad Sa'adi, it was you? No. How do you prevent the bitch about? I can not answer. If she is Jewish, she lives here. If she was goy, is dead. I was at the conference this morning. Hello. This is found the best hummus? Go instead to Jaffa. Look. Jeremy Pelman. Nice to meet you. You know what that means? This is the highest level empowerment. I work for the NSA. Electronic intelligence, satellites. If Gaddafi called his mistress, we know it. If he cut himself shaving, we also know. The CIA, beside us, this is a post office. We have embargoed intelligence against you. Since your raid on the plant, we encounter many, but we will not give you any sensitive information. They say you sabotage our diplomacy. I am Jewish and I would help. Say, you do not want take your crap here? This is not an office! He tried to integrate the CIA 68. They refused after passing polygraph. In addition, he smoked marijuana. And they still received NSA? The CIA has not sent the file. It is a storyteller. In college, he did believe his father was the Mossad. He suggested he was himself an agent. The Mossad does not want him. They know? "It is rated doubtful." The handwriting analysis is catastrophic. He married a goy, no children. Good then ? How he contacted me is aberrant. And its information? Analysts Aman are admiring. "Never seen" they say, and they want more. Well, here! We will call this source:Aladdin. Nobody will know who it is. No archives. No computer. No secretary, no written report. You're in occuperas. Your name is Raphael Chavit. Here are all the details of your coverage. You do that since when? From the beginning. Everything goes through you? What do you want to know ? Have you ever seen this girl? Stopped... You made the papers for her? Stop, Yossi wonder everyday. To learn what you in the head. I prefer to have nothing to say. Are we exfiltrated this girl? I have not made of paper for her. We do not see the difference? No. Except me. How? Viewing buffers to light. For transparency, you can see ... I bunk in some. One per page. Never the same. This is my signature. My wife, Catherine. Cathy, I want you Rafi Shavit Tel Aviv. - Did you have a nice trip ? - Yes. Jeremy loves Tel Aviv, he talks about it all the time.

Let the outside of it. For his own safety. It's silly, anyway, I tell him everything. I should maybe go ... No, we are two types with a woman, it's more natural, right? Let's sit down. Yes. Yes. I understand. Okay, I'll talk to him. I will talk to him ! Make a note if it reassures you. All you get on moderate Arab countries interest. The same for weapons Soviet in the region. Terrorism ? No, enough is known about the subject. Okay. Where is Pelman? I have not seen him today. You know he has fulfilled its safety record? It's old, that! They called me, it's still not sent them, they are furious. Go see the communications. Be assigned a code name in telephone booths. Israeli towns names no example. After each call you join the cabin as I have named. Perfect, very professional. You have something for me? No, not today. You have not seen Pelman? No, I have a package for him, but it is not there. I'm taking care of it. We do not want information on your country. We do not operate on the USA, we work in the USA. Of course, that's exactly what I think. - Where were you ? - Outside, for my research. What research? In your report on Libya. It's been five weeks I asked you that! So what ? It is an analysis you want, or telegram? Yes, but not a whore dictionary! I like work that is well done. You work too on movement of the Soviet fleet? This is the background, you'll understand. It would be better for me to understand, you follow me ? Good evening. Everything is fine ? Cake, hold, take a look. We can talk ? We can talk. Scope of Libyan missiles. anti-aircraft systems Tunisian and Algerian ... Everything is there, I followed the list. Looks like you prepare a small raid, right? Dany ? - Sorry ? - Dany ! And him ?

How can you think I'm doing it for the money? - It's a work. - No. It is an honor, a duty is ... We will speak again. This is the kind of place where you quickly notes when you're tracking. That's it. Give me your ticket. Take this. Here are your instructions. You'm leaving tonight. Do not go home. Learn it and swallows the paper. Now tell me about our friend. I want to know as if I met myself. How is it that you treat this source? By chance. Why Mossad does not he care? Aladin contacted one of our agents. Change of interlocutor would have been too risky. Are there any details Should not we know? If the Prime Minister wishes, I will provide All details. It is not helpful at this time. Now I need to know if I can continue. Yes of course. If we had to wait Americans they spin us like this equipment ... I warn you that if Aladin is US sooner or later it will be taken. And then, the diplomatic crisis will properly gigantic. If, by chance, Aladin is American ... This is a scenario very unlikely. Good evening, Mr. Pelman. Good evening, Allan. What time do you have? Quarter to five.
