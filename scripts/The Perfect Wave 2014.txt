So come back to me And now your love is gone Guess that it was plain to see It's a little more than love to be Love It's not just about love Almost everything It's almost everything And it takes more to stay, love Takes almost everything Takes almost everything... They say the best surfer in the world is having the most fun. It's not about competition. It's simply about the moment. When you feel it, you've come the closest you can get to touching eternity. Then you understand that freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. And a surfer on a wave is completely unaware of anything else on the planet. You lose everything. And for in that moment you really are truly free. This is what I seek. This is who I am. Bask in the reverie That's when I was young. Ian, how was the surf? - Eh, it was okay. - Hi! How are you? - What's up, bro? - What? - It's the trip, isn't it? - What trip? Hey, guys. You beat me here. How's it going? I know you. You helped my mom out with fundraising, right? - That's right. I'm Roxy. - Nice to meet you, Roxy. Ian. We've been working the whole day, dude. - Gotta come and help out. - Yeah, come on, Ian. Yeah, yeah. Next time, next time. Well, why don't you come out tomorrow? - It's for a good cause. - Oh, tomorrow... - There's supposed to be surf. - Yeah, right. Seriously, dude, you gotta come help out. Mom will appreciate it. It's one session. Hey, Ian. Bro, wait. We gotta talk about this trip. No, no, no. We will help you. We're not gonna let you do that all by yourself. No. Yeah, we will. Okay, okay. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. - Give me that. - I heard "we." What did you just commit us to? I just hate it when you eavesdrop on my conversations. You know, I have some papers to grade. You wanna come sit with me? - Gee, that sounds like fun. - Oh, well, it is. I wanna see, I wanna know That we can be a part of something good You never see, you never know That we can be part of something I wanna see, I wanna know That we can be a part of something good You never see, you never know That we can be part of something. I wish Ian would come and help tomorrow. It'll be good for him. That's not gonna happen. He's in a rebellious stage. He's been in a rebellious stage since he was 13. You know, I spoke to merv up the road at the dairy farm. He said he'd give him a job. - With the cows? - Yeah. Might make him realize that life requires some hard work. What every surfer dreams of finding is a small wave with a perfect shape... what we call a perfect wave. - The odds against finding that are... - Ian. Dude, get out here. This party's going off. There's loads of hot chicks. Bruce's beauties. I've always dreamed of going there. - I think it's time, bud. - Are you serious? I think we should plan it tonight. - Leave in the morning. - Yeah, doggie! Dude, this is gonna be sick! - So you're in? - Definitely! Hey, fellas. Who's up for a night surf? Yeah, I'm game. Come on, dude. On some of the rides, I timed them in the curl for 45 seconds. - Yeah, go for it! - Whoo! - Whoo! - Yeah! Whoo! I never expected such an out pour of help. - The congregation is so generous. - Well, he returns. Kim, don't say a word. Where's his car? How was the surf? I mean, church? Oh, honey, it was so great. We made $2,000. Oh, wow. You know, I wish you'd think of someone other than yourself and surfing. You could have at least come to support your mother. Oh, but I was with mom in spirit. Right, mom? Come on, can't you be serious just once? You're right, dad. I made a very serious decision. I'm leaving. What? Well, actually, travel for a while, surf. You're kidding, right? Who do you think is gonna pay for all this? I sold the car. You what? You sold your car? Honey, uh, we're not angry. We're just shocked. You just make an announcement? I can't believe you sold your car. Well, I'm not gonna need it on the road and... I was figuring I was gonna leave today. What? Well, right now, after I pack a bag. Let me talk to him. And I want you to remember something... you were not exactly an angel at this age. How'd that happen? Sold his car. Hey, good job. Here, take the gopro. Post some footage from the trip. - Thanks, bud. - You're really doing this? - I got to. - Dude, dad is fuming. Yeah, yeah, he'll get over it. Dude, I'm not gonna stop you, but I'll miss you, bro. - Dude, you wanna come with? - With you on the trip? - Yeah. - Yeah! - Really? - Yeah! Ahh! Yes! - But I can't. - Ugh, you had me going. Ian, are you up there? Here comes mom. Good luck, man. Thanks. Let's talk about this. Mom, if I don't do this now, I never will. Okay? Okay. - Okay? - Okay, yes. My firstborn leaving the nest. I should be happy. I mean, you're 24, right? I should be kicking you out. Yes. What? Just... where are you gonna go? That's the whole point. We get to decide, you know? - We don't have any plans. - Who's "we"? Greg's coming. - Mom. - I should've known. Was this his idea? No, this was my idea. It was. - You know, he's bad news. - Mom. We all know that. He's a good guy. Okay, mom? Don't worry. I love ya. Okay? It's gonna be pretty quiet around here without you, you know? Mom, stop. It's okay. Confirm, o lord, your servant Ian with your holy spirit. Amen. It never made sense to me. I never felt a thing. I never felt the presence of God. To me, he just did not exist. ...And daily increase in your holy spirit. Amen. Congratulations, Ian. Colin. Dad, have you ever heard God speak? No, not really. Mom, mom. I don't think it worked. Nothing happened. Have you ever heard God speak? Yes, I have. When grandma died and I was so upset, I heard God speak to me. He never answers me. This isn't for me, mom. I don't want to come to church anymore. I don't believe God is real. Ian, Ian. Wait. - Yes, mom? - Oh, Ian. If you could learn one thing from my life, I want you to remember one... one little thing. Okay? No matter how far you might be from God, no matter what you've done wrong, if you call out to him from your heart, he will hear you. And he will forgive you. Yes, mom. I'll remember that. Dad, I'm sorry I sprung that on you. - I should've talked to you first. - Ian, I... I wish I could talk some sense into you, but... I did the same thing when I was your age. So I know the dangers out there... the parties, the drugs, the risks. - It's easy to lose yourself. - Yeah, but, come on, dad. Those parties and stuff, that's not it for me. There's more. - You know, I spoke to merv. - At the dairy? Yes. It's a great place to start. You can surf weekends. It'll give you a sense of purpose, of direction for the future. It's not all about the future for me. It's about now. You know, get busy living or get busy dying. I just want what's best for you, son. When I get back, I'll get the whole package, okay? House, car, wife... Maybe even a dog. Yeah. I guess this is it. - Hey, Uncle Colin. - Greg. - Stay out of trouble, you hear me? - Yeah, I'll try. - Don't worry, pops. - Safe travels, son. Don't let him drag you into anything. If he thinks it's a good idea, don't do it. Wait! One more hug! Okay, one more hug. - You got my suit, right? - Yeah, I got it. It's in the trunk. Mom. Don't worry, mom. I love you, Ian. You have a good time and take care of each other. Listen... Whatever happens out there, God's watching over you. - Yes, right. God's watching. - I'm serious. I love you, mom. Ian, you need anything or you get into any trouble, you call, okay? Okay. Thank you, dad. Oh. Well, I'll see you when I see you. Baby bro, don't do anything I wouldn't do. Which means you can do anything. Sidney, here we come! Whoo-hoo! Leaving home, my mom had a premonition something might happen to me on this trip. And my dad, well, he just wants me to get ahead in life. And me? Well, I just wanna get out there and discover freedom. In June, July, and August Drinking white wine by the reservoir In just three months I'd known ya By then I could've told ya who you are... 'Cause all of ya all year round... What do you think you're doing, mate? Just dropping into my wave like that? So what happened out there? I got into it with this local. And this guy, who I didn't even know, paddled up and diffused the whole thing. - Jeez. - Hang on. Hey, ladies. - Hi. - How's it going, guys? - Good. - You're... you're not from here, eh? Nah. Well, we live in new Zealand, but we're from Cali. - You guys look pretty good out there. - Thanks. There's a Hawaiian beach party tonight if you wanna join us. - Sounds good. - Okay. - So we'll see you later? - Yeah. Where's it at? The big house at the bottom. - Down the beach? - Yeah. - Cool. - See you later. See you ladies there. Hey, how are you? - Oh, how's it going, mate? - Hey, there. - Hey. - Hey! You found it. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey, how's it going? Yep. You made it. You wanna go? There's that young guy I saw in the lineup today. Wanted to fight half the locals. That was you out there today. Thank you for stepping in. - Ian. - Ian, I'm Lachlan. No problem. Those guys are donkeys. They think aloha's a sign of weakness, you know? Yeah, aloha's a rare thing these days, man. - Sure is. - You're not from here, huh? No, we're all just traveling through, you know? Oh, sorry. Um, Ian. Hi, Ian. Nice to meet you. - I'll get us another round. - Cheers, love. So what's your vibe? Surfer on a surf trip. I gathered that. Where you headed? - Bali. - Indonesia, huh? Gonna hit Padang Padang? Ulus, the hole, green bush, what? Yeah, I'm pretty much on a dream surf trip. I just left home and... I'm doing it, the whole "endless summer" thing. We wanna hit all the spots, you know? So it's indo and then Africa. Africa. Africa's where you can lose yourself. Hit the standard... j-bay, cape town, then get up north a little bit. Some outer islands with some outer reefs. Just fire still waiting to be discovered, you know? - Really? - I'm headed there next, so hit me up. - Okay. Thank you. - Good meeting you, bro. - Cheers. - Cheers, love. Time to paddle out and chill. Everyone's towing. No, 'cause it's a complete lie. Africa's where you can lose yourself. With some outer reefs that fire... Still waiting to be discovered. Hit me up on the road. My dad used to say, "waves are not measured in increments of feet, they're measured in increments of fear. With the power to destroy us as much as thrill us, they give a natural, addictive high. Something to measure ourselves against." I'm headed out into the great unknown. New beginnings, new adventures. It's like paddling out to a new break for the first time, never knowing what to expect. When the clock turns 12:00 They say that things change A new day, a fresh start One more beginning... "Ian, live the dream. It's out there. Lachlan." Mac. - Hey, bud. - We've been looking for you, man. Dude, that party last night was sick. It was fun. Where's that chick you were with? I don't know. You got that look in your eye again. I think it's time we leave, man. I had a great time here, but it's time. - Where? - Stick to the plan. Go to Bali next. Why does this always have to be about you? Greg doesn't understand. I can't quite put my finger on it, but... It's not the parties or the girls. The chase is something... something that's more real than this. And I only feel it on a wave. And when it's over... I'm just left wanting more. - Thanks again. - Cheers, fellas. Good luck with them waves. Well, this is it. - Nice waves, huh? - Yeah. Bye. Didn't even understand that guy. Okay. I didn't think he was gonna drop us off here. I guess we'd better start walking, then. Seriously? You got a better idea? Come on, bud. Not far now. Hey, come on, buddy. Hurry up. Dude, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I followed you out here. Dude, what was wrong with Sidney? I mean, the waves were cranking, we had chicks, we were hooking up, the parties were amazing. We were over it, remember? We wanted to leave. Dude, maybe you were over it. I wasn't. Bro, this is all part of the journey. Just... let's just make the best of it, okay? So why you always telling me what to do? Dude, I'm not. You're acting like a child right now. - Dude, listen. - What? I'm so sick of this, man. I don't know why we're out here, why we couldn't have just flown there... damn! See, my friend? Ye of little faith. What are the chances, dude? I don't know, man. That's gotta be a billion to one. What are two white boys like you doing out in this mighty desert, eh? Trying to get to Darwin. Darwin, yeah? For what? - Surfing. - Surfing? - Hmm? - Yeah, you know... No, I don't know. What is surfing? Maybe you better show me. - Why don't you show her, Mac? - Yeah, why don't you show me, Mac? Um... You know... surfing. Show me! You lay down, then you paddle. - Paddle, eh? - Yeah. Go ahead, paddle. Show her. - And then you... you stand up. - Get up. And then you, uh... Ride the wave. Go ahead, ride that wave. - Ride the wave. - Come on, ride the wave. - Ride the wave. - You know, like this. Ha ha! I don't know if you're any good at this surfing. Ugh. Well, you guys better hurry up. I haven't got all day. You jackass. Good luck with this little space I saved you. Oh, easy, bud. Come on! There we go! The desert has its lessons, too. Not ones I care to learn. Bush fires and flash floods and solitude and the dryness and heat scratching out a life. It's empty in its vastness. Check this out. It's wave rock. - What? - Yeah. - That's incredible. That's a rock? - Yeah. "After surviving the outback, we finally made it to Darwin. Surfed two days with barely any swell. Now it's completely flat and there's nothing to do. We're off to indo this afternoon. Life is great on the road. Ian." Look at him. He's having such a good time. Can't say I'm not jealous, mom. Eh, you'll get there, Michael. You're doing it the right way. I miss him. Oh. When do you think he's gonna come home? Oh, when he runs out of cash and calls us for a ticket. Swing, swing, I'm turning back again Can you hear my heart beat? Swing, swing, I'm turning myself in Apathy has stung me Swing, swing, I'm turning to you Relight my candle flame Swing, swing, I'm turning back again Restart this still heart 'Cause I don't know why I fell so far down Tilting on down for you And I don't know why my heart lives But it's still life without you Swing, swing, my head is back now My eyes are opening to the light What I'm seeing here A million changes in your lives A million changes on their faces Can you hear them smiling? A heart worth living for A life worth dying for... I'm so glad you're here. You've been a great friend. I wanna do something crazy while I'm here. I don't know, be romanced or... Go on an awkward date followed by a long, cheesy walk on the beach. I tried to romance you once. I got barred. - Barred... what does that even mean? - You know, like, shot down. We're much better as friends. Yeah, I got that. I don't know, I feel like... I feel like I'm ready. Ready to move on. Yeah? I don't know, I saw this guy on the beach and it just made me think about things. There was something about him that was... I don't know, just special. Little Anna's coming out of her box. Yeah, I guess. Bali... what an amazing place. I have to share this with my family. Michael's gotta see some of these waves. Saw you surfing yesterday. And I saw you save that little boy's dog. That was you watching us. - I like surfers. - Ah. I'm a surfer. Yeah, I know. How do you like indo? I like it a lot. What are you doing tomorrow? Uh, probably surfing. This is where I'll be. Come find me. - Anna, you ready? - Yep. In a place like this it's easy to get lost in the moment. A beautiful culture, new and exotic. Awakening the senses and the whole body. It is so different from anything I've ever seen in my entire life. The culture and values here are so different, so foreign. Great beauty and terrible poverty exist side by side. And some of their idol worship makes no sense to me. Can a beggar be crowned a prince In the courtroom of the king? Hey. Shh. Can't you see I'm busy? You told me to come, remember? - I did? - Yeah. I must be crazy. You know I don't even know your name? I'm Annabel. Ian. Nice to meet you. Same. - Should I show you around? - That would be nice. With beauty adored Eternal love The other side of the story... So is this your thing? I find peace here. Yeah. - It's beautiful. - Mm-hmm. Were you surprised to see me? Nope. - Well, I kinda had to come. - Why? I had to know who that other guy was. Who? My date? - Your date? - Mm-hmm. You picked me up on a date? Yeah. I'm trouble. What? Yeah, I can see that. What did you tell him? - That I'm trading up. - Tra... and that I'm leaving tomorrow. Where are you going? There's this tiny island I know. I mean, it's literally paradise. Great surf, perfect beaches. It's just a lot better when you're not alone. I was hoping you'd go with me. Me? You don't even know me. No. Well, thank you. Um... But... I can't. I'm traveling with my buddy and I can't just bail on him. I'll change your mind. Eternal love The other side of the story Eternal love... Dude, what were you doing at that temple this morning? Dude, the waves were pumping. You missed out on everything. I know, I know, you told me. Dude, what are you thinking about? Oh, my... - Hi. - Hi. You must be Greg. - Hi. - Hi. Anna! Hey, how you doing? - I'm mark. - Ian. - Hey. - Greg. Nice to meet you, man. Come dance with me. Let me see your moves. It's beautiful here. Yeah, it's amazing. I can't believe how peaceful I feel right now. Come to the island with me. - I mean, we'll have so much fun. - Okay. Those kinds of places you just... you just need somebody... - you said, "okay"? - I said, "okay." You said, "okay!" You dipping out on me? Man... - Dude, I think I'm going crazy. - It's that chick, isn't it? Dude... I think I'm falling in love with her. I would, too, if she had gone for me. I thought you were gonna be mad at me. - I didn't know how to tell you. - Nah. We're just gonna go to this island for a week. - You can come if you want to. - Nah, I'm gonna stay here. - It's all good. - Really? What about Bruce's beauties? I'm down to go. Couple weeks? - Meet up? - Yeah. - Really? - We'll meet up in j-bay. Yes! God, I thought you were gonna be so mad. I cut like truth Any of my thoughts 'Cause even if I try to Deeper into light I fall And I fall Like a perfect wave for you Promise that you'll never go We could watch the world move round Teach me everything to know 'Cause I've been lost so long Deeper into light I fall And I fall... So, what do you think about this place? I love it. And what about your perfect wave? Well, I guess you could say I got distracted. - By me? - You? Little old you? No. - No? It wasn't me? - Mm-mm. And I fall Like a perfect wave for you Oh, man. Bruce's beauties. Yeah! - Roxy? - Hey! - You remember me. - Yeah. - How could I forget? - Easy, big guy. I know your reputation with the ladies. I'm not as bad as you think. Where's Ian? I thought you two were traveling together. Yeah, he ditched me for some girl. - And you? - Nah, I came here alone. You wanna hang out later on today? I'd love to. Enjoy your surf. - Thanks. - See you at the club tonight, then. All right, kiddo. You ready to learn how to surf? Before you can stand out there, you gotta learn to stand here. So I want you to get on the board. I want you to learn how to pop up to your feet. Okay, that was horrible. There you go. Pop! - Hmm... wider feet. - Show me what to do! You show me, Mr. I know everything. - Stagger, pop. - Oh, you make it look easy. - Yeah, I know. - Ready? Yeah. Come on. This is no fashion shoot. Get going, girl. There we go! That's the best one I've seen. - You ready? - I got it. I'm... yeah, um... Sure. Yeah, yeah! Thatta girl. Not bad for a beginner. Yeah, the stamps where... What's the 1500 like? The... Yeah, well, they were... I just really liked 'em because they were different. Very connected. Wow, you're quite the artist. I have my moments. Is that you? Self-portrait? It's supposed to be my brother. Are you gonna tell me about this perfect wave? - Really? - Yeah. I don't know how you describe something that's indescribable. I don't know. Maybe that's the most beautiful part about surfing. For me, it's big, perfect barrels. And the only way I can even begin to describe that is to say that... It's almost as if time stands still. And for in that moment, nothing else on this planet matters. There's a certain freedom in that. I think if you ask any surfer... If they've experienced that even just once in their life... They're hooked, and they'll never stop searching. I think that's all we are as surfers, just chasing that next moment in time. Well, we're obviously not gonna find that perfect wave of yours here. We should... we should go to Africa. I mean, aren't we meeting Greg there anyway? And we're, like, two weeks late. - You sure? - Yes. Cool. Well, I don't think I'm gonna have to call - the lifeguards for you today. - Yeah, it's pretty flat. I'm on the beach and I'm with you. I'm going to get some paddling in anyway. - Okay? - Yeah. - Would you help me with this? - Yep, sure. - Suck it in! - I am. Is that you or me? No, I think it's me. Hey, mom. Hey, dad. This is Annabel. Hi. How are you? Anyway, we're in Bali right now and we're headed to j-bay next. Then we're gonna go down to cape St. Francis for a little bit. Don't worry, mom, we're being safe. Anyway, we love you. Hope you're doing well. - Bye. - Bye. - Hmm. - Wow, she's beautiful. - And you're married. - And I know that. See you later. Run, run. Hustle, hustle. - Looks good. - Looks pretty fun. - See you out there. - All right, see you out there. No way! - Finally, dude. - Hey, what's up, bro? - So good to see you, man. - Dude, I'm so glad to see you here. - Told you I'd come. - Yeah, dude. I didn't know you were gonna make it. How have you been? - Great. - Hi. - Hey. - Good to see you again. - Nice to see you, too. - Roxy. How you doing? - Good to see you again. - Good, yeah, yeah. - Hi, I'm Roxy. - Annabel. - Nice to meet you. - Are you guys here together? - Yeah. - Oh, really? It's a long story. Let's get in the water. We'll talk about it later at the campsites. Yes, we absolutely will. - Dude, I'll tell you about it later. - Oh, yeah, buddy. See you back at the campsite tonight. Yo, Roxy, wait up. Let your heart skip a beat, don't hold on so tightly Let it go, let it breathe, come on, take it easy You will get to the place you want to be The stars that you wish on, the quarters in the fountain The candles that you blow out Every year that you add on is everything Oh, it's everything So keep on dreaming 'Cause I got a feeling Oh, I got a feeling Keep on dreaming, keep on dreaming Give me something For me to believe in It's you I believe in Keep on dreaming, keep on dreaming, keep on Take a ride, take a trip... Wow. I don't think this is such a good idea. Aw, come on. It's the biggest jump in the world. We gotta do it. You've gotta do it. You're like a little boy. - Whoo-hoo-hoo! - That was you, this is now Do you feel the same? You have to do it. You have to do it. Come on. Ugh, it's not a good idea. It's freaking me out. - Lachlan? - Anna? Oh, my God! What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - I have missed you so stinking much. - It's... ugh, so good to see you! - You, too! - Ian, my man. - What's up, bud? - Told you we'd meet up again, huh? - How do you guys know each other? I'll catch you guys on the flip side, all right? How do you know each other? - Countdown. Ready? Three... - He's just an old friend. - ...Two, one. - See you when I come up. Bungee! - What? - Great, an old friend. It's not like that, Ian. Hey, hold up. - Anna. - What are you implying? I just asked how you knew him. - He called you Anna. - So? So, it seems like you got a lot of old friends. We've never talked about our past and I'm not gonna get into it right now since you're acting like a child. Lachlan and I have a long history together, so just deal with it. Whoo! There you go. No! Ah! I'm getting in. Come on, Mac. Yoo! Holy moly! It's cold! Hey, Ian! Come on! Hang with us. Yeah. Come jump in with us! Whoo-hoo! Okay, food's getting cold. Heavenly father, thank you for this food. Thank you for this family and bless all whom we love. - Amen. - Amen. Mrs. Mac, please finish your story. Okay. Where was I? - Your mom. - Right. Anyway, so... When the boys were still really little, my mother had this terrible car accident. And when she was in recovery, they found out that she had me or ms... they weren't sure which one... and she became terribly ill. And I knew she was dying. I just kept praying and praying, and nothing happened. And, you know, I was really struggling to hold on to my faith. So, one day, I prayed and I just said, "I can't do this anymore, God. And I... if you're real, reveal yourself to me." And did he? - He did. - Wow. That must have been amazing. It was. What happened? Well, my gran died, but... Mom saw God's grace and heard his voice. And since that day, she has experiences like that all the time. Wow. - I'm so glad we made it to j-bay. - I know, man. This is exactly what we talked about. Hey! - Ian! - Stop it! - Get off me! - Stop it, guys! Stop! - Cool your jets, man! - Stop! - Get off me! - Stop it! - Get off me! - It's not what you think, Ian. Lachlan is my brother-in-law, Ian. As in married to my sister before she died. Anna. I can't believe that you would think that of me. - Do you not trust me at all? - I didn't know. He's the only tie I have left to her. - I didn't know you had a sister. - Just leave me alone. I don't want you in my space. - Just... don't touch me. - Please. Just leave me alone, Ian. Top of the morning, brother. Here you go. A little breakfast of champions. How did you find me? Where else would you be? I don't know where to start. I'm so sorry about last night. No blood, no foul. Don't worry about it. I don't know what got over me. - Guess jealousy. - Annabel's a complicated girl. More so than most. Since her sister died she's been lost. I know, if she... if she'd just told me anything about that, I would have been there for her, you know? Thank you. I gotta make this right and apologize. She's... she's gone. - What do you mean she's gone? - She split. - To where? - Who knows. Maybe Mauritius. Her folks got a place there. - That's where I'm going. - How do I get to Mauritius? Well, take my boat there. You can go with me. Yeah. When? How's this afternoon sound? All right, can't guarantee she'll be there, but the waves are coming. You in? Thank you. No problem, bro. I've sought my own desires Idolized my selfish ways Built my walls and fences good Emptiness grabs my soul Loneliness finds me Where am I now? Where am I now? Give me some fire - At the feet of your grace... - Simone! How you doing? It's been too long, my man. So good to see you. Hello, my brother. Welcome back. Thank you. This is my friend Ian. - How's it... nice to meet you. - Welcome to the island, Ian. - Yeah, nice to be here. - Ready to do this? - Oui, of course. - All right. - We have some place for you. - Cool. Brat. You are such a brat. - Hi. - Surprise. You're engaged? - What? - Oh, honey. - I'm so happy! - Whoa! - Thank you. - Let me see it. - Oh, it's beautiful. - Michael, I'm so proud of you. - Thanks, dad. She's perfect for me. - Oh, yeah. - Have you told your brother? - Not yet. - But he's gotta be my best man. - He's in Mauritius or somewhere. We'll get hold of him. Walked in ways I never should Built my walls and fences good Where am I now? Mauritius is an amazing little island in the Indian ocean. I never imagined a place could look and exist like this. It's paradise. I'm staying with new friends in a community on the beach. Things didn't work out with Annabel and that was tough. But I'm finding peace and happiness here in my heart. I may never leave this beautiful island. At least not in this body. - What about the boards? - Oh, they'll be fine. All right. - Hey, Simone. - Hmm? - Do you know a girl that lives here? - Oui, I know lots of girls around here. - What are you looking for? - No, no, it's not like that. - Her name's Annabel. - Oui, I know her. - Is she here? - No. Oh, I understand.

I'm sorry, but this is my son. You want your son? I'm talking about my son. I'm his father. - Please, I'm begging you. Can you... - Hello? Save Ian. I don't know your son, monsieur. Mauritius is very big. I know. Please, I'm begging you. Wherever he is, whatever he's done, lord... Hello? Hello? Hello? Which hotel you are staying in, monsieur? Hospital. Hospital, please.

Don't worry. I'll get an ambulance. Hang on. Hold it. We will get you help. Okay, okay. Here we go. - Okay, hang on. - Hey, what's wrong with your friend? He's been stung by a jellyfish. You should be careful with the heroin. Nobody can help you. Only God can save you. Help him, please. He's dying. He has been stung by a jellyfish. - Save him, please. - Okay, we need to get his wetsuit off. Just hang in there, Ian. Stay with me. We are almost there. - Ian? - Mom. Ian. I'm dying here. I'm dying, mom. No matter how far you might be from God, no matter what you've done wrong, if you call out to him from your heart, he will hear you and he will forgive you. Who do I pray to? Help me pray. I don't remember. Please help me pray. - Our father... - Who art in heaven... who art in heaven... Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... Forgive us. Forgive us. I forgive you. I forgive you. ...as it is in heaven. Thank you for loving my son. Help him, please, lord. God, if you're real, if you see anything good in my heart, please save me. Please save me. I don't want to die. I surrender what's left... I surrender what's left of my life to you, Jesus. Okay, hurry. We need to get him into icu quickly! Get out the way! Move! He should be dead. I count five stings. Bring the defibrillator in. Stay with me, son. Put the oxygen mask on now. Son, can you hear me? - Check the blood pressure. - I'm not getting a reading, doctor. Stay with me, son. I can hardly feel the pulse. - Give me 10 milligrams of adrenaline. - Yes, doctor. He's flatlining! Nurse, start the CPR. One, two, three... Stay with me. For thine is the kingdom and the power... And the glory forever. He's still flatlining. Stop that now. We've lost him. No, no, no, no! No. No. My baby. He's so young. Dying alone in a hospital, probably far from home. Hello? Doctor? Nurse? I think you guys turned the lights off. I can't see anything. Hello? Time of death... 11:18 pm. I'll take him to the morgue. Who do we notify? We don't even know who he is. I tried to touch my face, and my hand went right through me. It was like I was out of my own body. Can I help you? He's my friend. I am so sorry. I can't believe it. We did everything we could to save him. Can you notify his relatives? Where am I? Who is that? Who is that?! Where? No. No, no, no. No, I prayed. I asked for forgiveness. I asked for forgiveness, Jesus. Ian, you are forgiven. I love you. Thank you, lord. Thank you. Guys, I have bad news. Ian is dead. How do you know he's dead? I saw him at the morgue. He's gone. Once you get stung by invisible, that's it. You're gone. I'm sorry. Ian, I am the true light. And in me there is no darkness. Jesus... Who are they? These are the ones for whom I died... The ones who will never step into my church, who will never know the love that I have for them unless someone goes to them... And tells them. Mom? I have... I have to go back and tell her it's true. Ian, if you return... Please. ...You must see things in a new light. I'll tell them. I'll tell them about you. Please give me a second chance. Tilt your head back, Ian. Now, open your eyes... And see. Doctor! Doctor! Hello? Dad? Ian? Ian, is that you? Here. Here's your mother. It's Ian. Ian? Ian? Oh! You... you are dead! I went to the hospital! I saw you in the morgue with my own eyes. Simone, don't worry. It's me. I was, but I've been given a second chance. People don't survive invisibles. You're back from the dead, Ian. What happened? I don't know if you guys will ever believe me, but there's something much bigger out there than us. Let me tell you what happened to me. My life has changed forever. Mac. Did you see Lachlan's wave? - I did. - It's a wave of a lifetime, man. So, what about you, Mac? You don't leave till later this evening and the waves are still firing out there. Nah, not today. I've ridden my wave. Yeah, I've been thinking about what you said last night and I believe you. I downloaded the e-version Bible this morning and I started to read it for the first time. Really? Can I take a look? Yeah, I'm gonna catch a wave. Come say cheers before you leave, okay? Okay. Take it easy. Walked in ways I never should Built my walls and fences good Where am I now? Where am I now? Give me some fire At the feet of your grace Feet of your grace The feet of your grace And merciful hands At the feet of your grace The feet of your grace Yeah, yeah Feet of your grace The feet of your grace. Our father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done On earth as it is in heaven Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us for our trespasses And lead us not into temptation Deliver us... I'm standing here looking upon a being who's surrounded by light, not a shadow or touch of darkness. I have just come from a realm which was complete darkness. There is no light here. I'm going, "if that's God, how on earth can I be standing here? Surely if he knows my name, he knows my thought before I even speak. Everything must be transparent before him. I've made a mistake. I'm not a good man. They've obviously beamed the wrong person up." I began to move back from the light feeling very ashamed, very self-conscious, and began moving back towards the darkness to judge myself back into hell. As I began moving back, waves of light emanated off his presence. The first wave of light touched me. I felt unconditional love and acceptance. As waves... my whole hands and fingers tingled as I felt this liquid light into the core of my being and I felt pure love. I began to weep. I thought, "men don't cry." More tears began to come. Wave after wave of love. I thought, "God, surely you know my sins. You can't love me." More love kept coming. I thought, "perhaps he doesn't know. I should tell him now." No use coming in and having to kick me out later. So I stood there and said, "well, God, I've cursed and broken your commandments, taken drugs," and began speaking all my sins out. "I've slept around." As I continued to speak the worst of my sins, his love got so strong that I ran out of being able to tell him It's as though every sin had been completely forgiven. He said, "Ian, everything you had ever committed was forgiven in that ambulance when you prayed the lord's prayer." And lead us not into temptation Deliver us, deliver us And lead us not into temptation Deliver us Thy kingdom come. I cut like truth Any of my thoughts 'Cause even if I try to Deeper into light I fall And I fall Like a perfect wave for you Promise that you'll never go We could watch the world move round Teach me everything to know 'Cause I've been lost so long Deeper into light I fall And I fall Time can stand still Emotion never will I guess I've fallen under you You ask me what I came here for And I fall Like a perfect wave for you I promise that I'll never go 'Cause everything around me says To take the stars and bring 'em home A simple life we'd make Deeper into light I fall And I fall Like a perfect wave for you.
