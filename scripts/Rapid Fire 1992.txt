That's your history. You owe me, the Tongs owe me, everybody owes me. And I don't give a fuck who hears it! What the hell did he just say? It's a Sicilian proverb. It means: "Don't ask for what you can't take." Machine guns cannot murder our dreams. Prisons cannot silence our voices. Two years ago today, Tiananmen Square was a nightmare!

I know he's weak. As long as you take care of business, everything will be fine. I will. I will, Tommy. - Hi, Jake. - How you doin'? Come in. For a minute I thought I had the wrong address. No. This is the place. - This'll work. Yours? - A businessman lets us use it. Ladies and gentlemen... Jake Lo. He was there, everybody. He was in Tiananmen. His father was one of the great martyrs of the cause. Hi. I'm so glad you could make it, Jake. How else could we get you down here? Just wait a second. Listen to me. Please. We need money, Jake! Just a few words. No politics, no flag-waving. - Just the truth about what you saw. - Paul? This is our sponsor - Carl Chang. Jake. Great admirer of your father's. So what's in this for you, Mr Chang? Democracy. Capitalism. It's all a good cause. Well, uh, if you'll excuse me... Refreshments are upstairs. It's a pleasure, Jake. All right, everyone! You follow me, I'll give you a tour of our operation. As you can see over here... Come on, stay for one drink. Let me make it up to you. Well, you have something for me? The trucks are rolling. They will arrive in Chicago ahead of schedule. Ahead of schedule? That's what I like to hear. Over there. We came down the chimney. Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho. Your boss, that, uh... ungrateful yellow bastard... won't give me what should be mine by rights. He says... "Oh, you got to be willing to take it." Well... I'm an American. And we know how to take things. I'm takin' your percentage of the heroin business... as of right now. You do not want to do this. - You can't do this! - It's done. Give me your shipping manifests and your books. Come on, come on, come on. Oh, that's a good boy. You goddamn Guinea bastard! Son of a bitch! He's mine! Come on! Agh!

Go down the stairs! You'll be OK. Go! Get me outta here. Black jacket across the kitchen. Get him! Shit! Son of a bitch! Whack him! Shit! - Freeze! - Hey! Hands on your head! - Gentlemen. Nathan Wesley, FBI. - Morning. - Special Agents Stuart and Daniels. - Hello. This is a local murder case. Who called the Feds? Carl Chang was the chief middleman in the supply of heroin to the Chicago Mafia. - Who's this kid? - Name is Jake Lo. Student, art major. - We wanna see him. - This way. He's the only one who saw what went down. Father was career army, deceased. Army intelligence. He was attached to the Beijing embassy in '89 when the shit went down, Medal of Honor, taught the martial arts at Langley. Wing chun, kung fu, mui tai. Great. More cops. - We're FBI. I'm Special Agent Wesley. - Cops in suits. You wanna take a look at the mug books? Help us out! You know what I think? Maybe this is the guy that did it. - The guy that did it needed a gun. - Put that thing down! - Hey, hey! Take it easy. - Shut up, Frank! Now look in the goddamn books. - He's not in the books. - What makes you so sure? Look. Look. Serrano. - That's who shot Chang? - Friend of yours? This is our break. How about giving Jake some space? Cigarette? In 48 hours, the grand jury shuts down a three-year investigation... into the Chicago branch of La Cosa Nostra, of which Antonio Serrano is the boss. - Great. Keep the picture. - Serrano must've taken this awful personal. I'll bet he hasn't pulled a trigger himself in 15 years. That's right. And you, my friend, were there to see it. You're our prize witness. Look, all I wanted to do was clear myself. If I'm not under arrest, I'm going home. You'll be under 24-hour FBI protection. A weekend in Chicago, first-class air, hotel. - No way! - You'll cooperate... or I'll bury your ass in charges you can't even spell. What charges? How about assault and battery, obstruction of justice, manslaughter? What judge is gonna buy that? My judge. Think it over, Jake. You wanna make the right decision here. That's blackmail. That... is law enforcement Where are they keepin' him? Yeah? He's broke. All his guys are in the pen. He's weak. Tau to Chang to Serrano. Around the Horn. And last night somebody took Chang out of the game - What does that tell you? - Eliminate the middleman. Somebody's going into business for themselves. Something's coming down. My guy at the airport just called. Well, Detective Withers, my intelligence officer. Lay some intelligence on me, will you? You used to be on top of things, Lieutenant - What have you got? - A witness. And he's right here in Chicago. - Who, what, and where? - Some kid, just flew in from LA. - Who's got him? - The Feds. The Feds. Get off your asses! Farris, pull these guys together. Move it! Go get yourself a bag of doughnuts. This way. Look, Jake... Any problems, you get nervous, you need to talk, whatever... you can reach me at this number. - OK. - I need to call home. - It's taken care of. Relax. Watch TV. - I'll see you in eight hours. - OK. Daniels. - Who is it? - It's me. Daniels. - Anderson, this is Jake. - Jake. - And this is Klein. - Jake, welcome aboard. Well, it was a lousy flight. Great hotel, though - Glass of water? - Help yourself. Pop-Tarts. More Pop-Tarts. This is good. - What are you doin', Jake? - I'm hungry. We can send out for Chinese if you like. Can I stand the excitement? I'm gonna see if there's a game on. So who else is testifying against this guy? Nobody's gonna testify against Serrano, especially you, Jake. It's a low neighbourhood. Yeah, it's a low neighbourhood. Oh, shit. - Wrong place, wrong time. - Yeah, Jake Lo... - Cop killer. - Go, go. Ow! Ow! You... broke my fuckin' nose! Son of a bitch! Agh! You're all done, Jake! Shit! - Don't move! - No, it's OK! Drop your weapon now. - Listen, lady, you got the wrong guy! - Shut up! Stay put. Release the hammer slowly and surrender your weapon. - I'm a cop! - I said drop the gun! Daniels! FBI! That kid just killed 2 federal officers! - Let me see that. - Hey, watch it! - Let the girl go now! - Goddamn it! He's trying to kill me! - Just do it! - I didn't do anything! It's gonna be all right. Hey, hey, hold your fire! I'll get it. - Hello. - Hi, Frank. - Jake? - Yeah. Remember me? Jake, Jesus Christ! What happened? What the hell is going on? You know what kills you? You know what's killing you in life, huh? Negative thinking. You gotta think positive. Like here in Chicago, we had that mayor... whatshisname, you know. Anyone Everybody thinks everything is going down the tubes. Bada-bing! He has a heart attack. He's dead. Think positive. This Tau... Everything looks terrible. He's got us by the balls. Think positive. Cut off his hands. Mr Serrano, it's for you. I'm gonna have to insure that stomach of yours with Lloyd's of London. Yeah? The kid got away. He got away? Damn it! What do you mean he got away? How did he get away? - Did they pop Klein? - They killed Klein, but the kid got away. - We paid good money to them Feds. - Don't worry. I have it wired. You better have it wired. That kid saw everything. Too bad these wires ain't legit. He's meeting me at 7 There's a streetlight there. You can't miss him. We'll be there I'm sure you will. Hey, you fuck this up again, I'll blow your house up! Jake? Right here. Let's go. Come on. If you wanna keep breathing, kid, don't move. - Freeze! - I'm a cop. You freeze! - Stay the hell out of this. - Figure it out. If this dickhead was any kind of real FBI man... two of his buddies dead, he'd have offed you already himself. Who the hell is this guy, Jake? I'm your friend. I've been through this with you. Now, just keep coming and let's get you the hell out of here. Get down! Agh! You're a slow learner, kid Get your ass in here! Get your head down! Sons of bitches! Son of a bitch! Jesus Christ! Hiya. Name's Ryan. Lieutenant Mace Ryan. Jake Lo. So tell me, Jake, are you having a bad day or what? Everybody, listen up. Meet Jake Lo. He's gonna give us Kinman Tau. Jake, this is Detective Farris. Takes care of tactical surveillance. - Nice to meet you. - Karla, meet Jake. We've met. - What the hell are you doing? - What the hell are you doing?! This guy is all over the radio. We've got to turn him over. Forget it, goddamn it. We are gonna get Tau! Hey, hey, hey. Where you going? I was just supposed to identify some guy named Serrano. Serrano is at war with Tau. Great! I hope they kill each other. I could not be that lucky. I've been after Tau for 10 years He's one of the largest producers of heroin Chang was his No.1 distributor till Serrano took him out. So what? What does this have to do with me? You are gonna help me nail him. Yeah. This is not my problem. Where you gonna go with a gun at your head, huh? Every cop in this city's looking for you. You're a cop killer. You know what that means? I'm off the department's Christmas list? Wise-ass. Step out on that street, you'll last as long as a new Ferrari! It was self-defence! You think the first cop you run into is gonna give you time to explain that? And don't forget about your friend Antonio Serrano still looking for you. I'm your only ticket outta here, kid. So what do you want, cop? How do I get off this ride? Cheer up, Jake. You're doing a public service. Hell, you should be happy to nail scum like Tau. Like I can give a shit. Yeah? I used to think like that too when I was young, but things change. Been after this son of a bitch for 10 years. - Why? - Why? - It's my job. - Oh, Christ! Another hero. Mind if I take a little stab in the dark here? - Got a family? - Yeah. You see 'em much? No, right? - I'm divorced. - Yeah. And when you do see 'em, you talk about your job, right? Only it's not a job, it's a cause. It's this righteous cause and it's more important than anything, right? - Well, how come that is? - Listen, kid. Sooner or later, you gotta take a stand in life. You gotta care about something, I don't know, community, people, something. - You sound like my father. - Yeah? Sounds like a pretty smart man. Maybe I'll meet him sometime. Yeah. Maybe you will. Nice house on government pay, huh? He tells me to call him Frank, like we're soul mates, the son of a bitch! Listen I know you're pissed at this guy, but keep yourself under control. This isn't some goddamn revenge thing, OK? OK? Sure, Lieutenant. Anything you say. Hi, Frank. Agh! Shit. - Hey, come on. - Oh, my God! - It's all right. I'm a police officer - It's all right, Lisa We just wanna talk. It's all right. We'll be in the study. What? Jesus Have another drink. You're gonna need it. - Just read me my rights. - I don't wanna arrest you, Frank. The man wants to be arrested. I say arrest him. Jake! Why don't you take those fists of fury of yours outside? - You're making the poor man nervous. - Good. This poor man. He's meeting me at 7 There's a streetlight there. You can't miss him. - We'll be there. - I'm sure you will. You fuck this up again, I'll blow your house up! Well... your wife's an attractive lady. I can't see her waiting around for, what, say, 20 years or so? Now, on the other hand, that shipment that Tau sent to Chicago, trucks are on the way. I wanna know where and when. Serrano's the only one who knows that. And I never dealt with him directly. I always went through Gazzi. Oh, he'll deal with you. He wants Jake. She pours it in. He tastes it. Says "Delicious". Except it's not anisette, it's kerosene. He says "Can I have another?" Yeah? Hey, you go fuck yourself! You got some explaining to do! Who is that? It's, uh... Stuart, the Fed. He says he'll only talk to you. I told him to go fuck himself. Let me talk to him. What happened last night, Frank? It was a bust No kidding Some cop walked right into middle of it. What are the odds against that? 1000 to 1? Hey, Frank, if I want odds, I got bookies. Tell me something I don't know. I have him Chicago cops can be very reasonable - It costs me, but I have him. - You don't worry about what it costs. You bring him over. We... Tell him you can't risk it tonight. OK, Frank? OK? This kid is a third-degree burn right now because of your guys. They fucked up, not me I'm not going anywhere tonight. Who said anything about tonight? Bring him over tomorrow. That way it's nice and clean. You understand what I'm saying? I'm only gonna give him up if you're there personally. Where am I gonna go? Florida? It's OK. This is Serrano's restaurant. He usually sits here. Every afternoon, 2.30, he pours himself a sweet vermouth and watches the soaps. You really know this guy. I know all about you, too. I know about Beijing, about Tiananmen Square. I also know that you were 30 days late paying your last Visa bill and you got a B- in biology Yeah? So? I got screwed on the midterm. Look, I'm sorry about before. - There was a lot happening... - It's OK. Forget it. Now pay attention. Here's the plan for tomorrow. This is the fire exit. When the tear gas goes off, you get out through this door Sharpshooters across the street will cover you. Then duck out behind this back alley. I could get killed in there tomorrow, couldn't I? You've got to trust Ryan. He would not send a civilian in there if he thought he couldn't control it. Army intelligence told my dad the same thing. He came home in a box. you know I never even knew why we were over there. They've been promising to show me his military file for 2 years. I haven't seen shit. That's the way these guys are. So don't talk to me about trusting Ryan. Sounds like you hate him because he reminds you of your father. You don't know anything about my father, OK? My father never got anyone else killed. Sit down. Hey you're wired for sound, my man. All right, now. The clear signal is "Nice doing business with you." - We hear that, we're in. - Right. After this, you get me squared with the locals and I go home, right? You got it, that's a deal. I get when and where on the shipment from Tau and you get a free ticket back to bikinis and palm trees Gwai-Lo What did you say? You want me to do the translation? Yeah, just answer him for me He says he thinks he's in love with you. Get in line. Move out, Jake. Get him to the car. Jake, move it. Remember, Frank, the signal is "Nice doing business with you." This thing is way too tight. Someone so much as sneezes... I know you got the hots for him, but can't you get control for 10 minutes? - I'm talking business... - So am l, damn it! You're supposed to by my intelligence officer! Why don't you try showing me some? Now get your ass across the street! I want you to know, Jake, that I'm the only one who did this to myself and to you. I want you to know that I take responsibility for my personal actions This isn't EST, Frank. Mr Serrano's waiting Inside Skirmish teams 1 through 4, give me the high sign if you're ready. Over. Look at this. The FBI always gets its man. Serrano's got religion. Give me the word and I'll send him to his maker Negative, hold your fire. Swithc him off only on the Lieutenant's signal. Copy? Copy that. Have I ever let you down? - I have something I have to talk to you about. - Wait a second. Pleasure before business. You saw me clip that guy, right? What was the fuck his name? - Ching... Chung... - Chang. You know what I heard? I heard he wasn't dead. He was 18 hours in the hospital before he died. The cops kept asking who did it, except there wasn't enough left of him to say. He could scream, though. Aw... agh! More or less. - You saw me, right? - I saw you. Look at that, huh? Look at that posture. Bad posture. That's the root of every health problem in America You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna break your hands, finger by finger. And then I'm gonna break your ribs, rib by rib. Then I'm gonna break your legs. - Knock yourself out. - Jesus, kid! Knock yourself out? Mr Serrano, excuse me. With all respect, I gotta get downtown We had an understanding. I'll get back to him later. Put it right here. There. You just got sex appeal. Come on, Frank! I have another deal for you. Could we talk... you know, privately? What's on your mind? - The Bureau knows about... - Sh! Come on. Let's talk. The Bureau knows about your heroin shipment. - And what's your end? - Say, 100K off the top. Frank. Frank, Frank, Frank. Tomorrow night. Monarch Linen, Chinatown. Yes! What time? Midnight Just one thing. You guarantee no cops, no Feds, and I give you nothing. No 100 grand. Zip. You do it as a favour for me, for free. OK, Mr Serrano. - Tony. - Yeah, Tony. Thanks again for this, huh? That's the thing about doing business with you, Frank Shit! - What's the matter? - We lost Stuart's mic. Any time, Tony. "Nice doing business with you" - Hey, Frank. - Yeah? Why'd you say you'd do it for free, Frank? "Nice doing business with you" - "Nice doing business with you", Tony. - Yeah. Nice doing business with you. You know, the only time a man doesn't want any money... - is when he wants somethin' else. - Hey! You're sweatin' like a pig. All he wants to do is get outta here in one piece No, Tony... Son of a bitch! Move in! Move in! Go! Go! Go! We're movin'! Stand him up straight. Stand him up straight! Come on! Move! Move! Move! - We got cops out here! - How many? Cops?! Get the cars! Take some men. Get the hell outta here! Take your shot! Take your shot! No can do. Lost the shot. Two, take him! Negative. Target not clear. No shot. No shot. Son of a bitch! Fucking kid! Fuck! Ryan! Jake never came out. I know, goddamn it! What the fuck do you want me to do about it?! Michael! Kill that fuckin' kid. Second wave! Second wave! Go! Go! Get over there! Agh! OK... OK. I'll make you a deal. What I gave Stuart... you can have that. It's not good enough. That's 25 grand! What the fuck's the matter with you? OK. All right. What do you want, huh? You didn't hear nothin'. You didn't see nothin'. I'll give you all the money you want. Tony... The only time a man doesn't want money is if he wants somethin' else. You're sweatin' like a pig. All he wants is to get out in one piece. Not the face. - Nice plan, Lieutenant. - Jesus Christ! Real smooth. Gimme a hand. Fuck you. Steve, take this piece of shit and book him. I hear they need a police commissioner in Beirut. What's your problem, kid? We had a deal, right? ...he got away? How did he get away? - Did they pop Klein? - They killed Klein, but the kid got away. - We paid good money to them Feds. - Don't worry. I have it wired. You better have it wired. That kid saw everything. The Feds got a copy of this tape. - You're clear, just like I said. - You son of a bitch. Why didn't you use that tape before? I needed you. Look, this is a war, kid. There's no sideline. You're on one side or the other. Maybe it's time you asked yourself what your little war costs. Whatever it takes. - Lieutenant? - Ah, forget it. - Now we get Tau. - It ain't over. C'mon. Get in the fuckin' car. Jake! Where are you going? "Whatever it takes"? I'm so tired of that bullshit. "Whatever it takes" is something that happens to somebody else. You know he's still the best cop I've ever known, okay? You need to get out more. Jake, the next flight to LA doesn't leave for another 4 hours. I think I've had enough police protection, Detective Withers What if told you I had something you'd like to get your hands on? - Excuse me? - I have your dad's file. He's got some brass. You gotta give him that. Welcome back, Mr Serrano. - After you. - No. After you, Mr Serrano. - How's the missis? - The missis, she's fine. Yeah? That's good. Fuckin' kid. Fuckin' kid broke my fuckin' nose! Where did you get this? I told you. Some friends in the Federal building. I called them for some favors You better call 'em back I don't think they got the whole thing. What did you think you were gonna find in there? I don't know. Nothing. You're welcome. It wasn't an easy thing to get, you know. Well, then, why'd you do it? - Excuse me? - Everybody wants something... especially a 24-hour-a-day cop. You're really asking why I did this? I'm just wondering when Lieutenant Ryan and his wish list gonna come through the door? You asshole! I read the file, Jake. Your father was doing what he thought was right... and he died. It happens every day. Deal with it. Dad! We have to get outta here! Jake! Jake, get out now! If I only could have... I was 10 feet from him when the tank... when he died. Everybody dies. But he died for something he believed in. You're alive, Jake. You gotta let him go. I know. I miss him. "Can't Find My Way" by Hardline Here comes that feelin' Burnin' in my heart again And why's it comin' back Back to haunt me again?

Torn it apart. Nothing got a goddamn thing! I know it's there. I can smell it! Maybe if I had a man on the inside. I don't know. - What about Farris? - Nah. They know Farris. It doesn't matter anyway. Tomorrow I'm gonna be back on foot patrol. - It's just a waste of time. - It's just time, Mace. It is just 10 years of my life wasted! Flushed! And for what? - For what's right. - Yeah? What is right, Karla? Huh? I stood there last night staring at that little son of a bitch... and I realised I couldn't even spoon out... this one worthless piece of wormshit, Kinman Tommy Tau! At least I didn't get that kid killed. You mean Jake. Yeah. I like that kid. Maybe you should have told him. I don't have to say somethin' like that. He knows. He knows. Hey, Mace. - We're still gonna get Tau, right? - Yeah, right. Maybe he'll give us both a job in his laundry. About time! I'll be goddamned. - You ready? - Ready. Let's get you wired. Come here. Hitch your shirt up. How does this feel? Is this comfortable? - Feels like a gun in my back - Yeah Good. Maybe that'll keep you on your toes. Withers? Withers, go ahead. Workers going in now. All right, now listen. Remember the names I gave you - your family back home, friends. - Anybody stops you... - Hit 'em with the names. I know. Look, it's just, uh... you and me here.

The two cops are coming. You can come. Everyone stays alert So... Looks like you finally figured me out, Ryan. Funny, Serrano thought the same thing. Now, don't be stupid, Tommy. I got backup all over the street. SWAT, helicopters. You won't get 10 feet outside that door. You're stupid! You come here alone! You have no backup. Alone with just this girl! What's happening? You were a good adversary... but you're getting very sloppy! Cut the bullshit, Tommy boy! You make it sound like we've been playing chess for the last 10 years. Hey! I'm a cop... and you're a piece of shit. That's the story. I've never killed a cop. Thought it was bad for business. Now... I'm gonna have to kill two. Remember this, Ryan. This is all your doing.
