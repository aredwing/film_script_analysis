"What could be the reason? ls it desire or fate? It is their desire, it won't go away, but is there such a man.. ...in Brahma's world who can fulfill their desire? Who is that Mr. Perfect? Mr. Viraam Prasad! Your mother's only son. You value time very much. You are number one in everything you do. Now, you'll be number one to die. I thought Singh was a big businessman and a builder..

"Listen, please pick me up in your arms" I know. So, I told her not to go to the city. She's talking about some Viraam. Father, talk about him with respect. Don't shout at me I didn't return home like sister came with a child. Sorry, sister. I like him You see him and then decide. Did you see? She was pleading to me when she went". ...now she is ordering me. That's the reason I said.. "Education makes you smart. ...as well as ruins your beliefs. You stay quiet. Keenhi, look here.. You said you like him Does he like you? Sure, if not.. ...why would he come to my house when I invited him home? Why would he say, "I like you"?

He is mine. - No, he's mine \Mll you shut up? Why should I? - Shut up! Stop it. Wham do you all think? I called you here to talk" "but you are falling over me. You all are educated, right? Wham do you think love is? You won't get it so easily. You can acquire it so easily. Or is it alms to get it? No, it is born between two hearts. Even I am a human being. You should love a person. One should have the heart to accept the love. That's the reason I'm asking you. Like this? -V\Iham do I do? I can't imagine my life without you. But I can't live.. - I will die. - Of course. ...l will live only with you. If not, I will consume poison. - I will hang myself. I will come under your car and die - Shut up! What is wrong with you? I love you. No, you have gone crazy. Only your love can subside my craziness I can give my love to only one It is not oblation of God that I can share it with you three. Okay, tell me who that one girl is. - Look.. ...you've told me your opinion. I want time to tell my decision. How many days? - I don't know. I will tell you when the right time comes. But one is true.. ...l am in love with one of you. If you know who it is.. "They will be happy.. ...and the other two will be shocked. Rather than one being happy.. ...it is important that the other two should be able to bear that shock. We can't wait. - The one who has trust on love.. "Nothing is impossible for them. Leave this matter to me. Better you people relax. 'I am in love.. "With one of you.' 'I am in love.. "With one of you.' 'I am in love with one of you.' Yes, Singh? - Viraat.

I will shut your mouth like they seal mouths in a devotional funfair. Don't talk about my family. You are very lucky. Three girls love you at the same time It is good that my burden got eased. Viraat, they both are good" ...how does Preethi look? She looks like a man. It won't be good to marry a man. Okay, just tell me who do you like, I will talk to them. Mother, please. 'NW? Do you know what position those three are in? Ifl tell one name, the other two will commit suicide Boss, your life is important for us. Okay; okay. Mother, I love only one. But life of other two is also important for me. Because I like them for various reasons. I'll see the right time and convince both of them. ...and I will be friends with them Okay, at least tell me who is the girl you love. Mother". ...you very well know that I don't do anything without telling you It is okay with me, but what about the girls? Let they feel their love Why should we fight amongst ourselves? Two of them should back out. You both go. - Look.. ...you both are like my sisters, so.. ...if you agree, I will marry Viraat. What about our love then? - Tie it in a bundle and throw it. That is her idea. We all are sisters. ...then why don't you leave him for me? - No.. Actually, I didn't have an idea of marrying him It is for my family. - Even l.. "Want to take my Viraat home.. ...and convince my parents. Should I become a monk and live in hermitage. ...and sing hymns? You are marrying him for your family. I'll marry him for myself. I didn't listen to anyone before falling in love with him Even now I won't listen to anyone. Keenhi, she is immature But you are mature, right? "Listen. Listen." "Listen, he's my would-be." "Why are you staring at him?" "Listen, he is my hubby." "Why are you eyeing on him?" "I will break your teeth and throw stones at you if you eye on my guy." "There are three balls and one bat."

Viraam specialty is to mend such people Look, you took away my project. You ruined my relationship with CM. I've only incurred loss because of you. So, either make me your business partner.. ...or compensate the loss. A lion can't befriend a swine. It is not good to go against Lord Yama I have two qualities in me If you walk on the right path. ...l will give you life even after Lord Yama comes after you. If you walk on the wrong path. ...l will send you to hell. You'll get ruined. You'll know who's going to get ruined. If you are a real man.
