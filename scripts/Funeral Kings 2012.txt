How'd they find out? You fucking idiot! What's the matter, Bobby? Are they going to tell my parents? Dude, what's going on? Nothing, take this! Where are you going? We're not going to hang? I can't, alright? What are we supposed to do? I don't know, man. I'm not your babysitter. Just tell me what's going on! - I can't! - Why not?! Because you're a little kid, alright? I'll see you tomorrow. And she does this all the time? Yeah, man. The baby's got to eat. So her tits are just hanging out for anyone to see? No, man. Jesus Christ! She wears something over it, the baby just goes underneath. Boy your dad did it right this time. I would give my left hand to see your step mother's tits. Come on, man! What are you doing? Mind your fucking business, Klienfeddler! What are you doing? Who has time to memorize 40 vocab words? Shit! There's a test? Clear your desks. Take out your number 2 pencils. Dick. Principal's office... after the exam. Fuck. Mr. Thompson? Can you send Andrew Gilmour down to the office? He has to serve a funeral. Be prepared to take the test tomorrow, Andrew. No problem! What's going on, Bobby? I've got to hide this in your room! You can't go in there. My parents are going to wake up! Shit. When are you going to be back to pick it up?! I don't know. Don't open it... ...and don't tell Charlie. Shit. Andy, what's going on? Nothing, Charlie had to pick up a text book. Are you kidding me? No way, you're like five-years-old. Eat a dick, I'm fourteen! Chill out, dude. - Hey Rye! - Hey what's going on? Nothing. Is Miss Nolan back yet? I'm pretty sure she's out for the next week. - Awesome. So you do the paper or what? Hell no. Good neither did I! Don't be late for class. Alright, we'll try. See ya. I would do awful awful things to that girl. - Why are you still here, man? - Uh, I've got money. - Make it twenty-five. - Twenty. No. Twenty-five. Fine. Here you go. Just stuff it in your pocket. I don't want some teacher seeing me selling to a fucking kindergartener. Fuck you, man! See ya later, man. Dude, where were you? You've got to start reading the obits, dude. I knew this lady died three days ago. I just came right here. What? Bobby came over to my house last night. For what? Where is he now? I don't think he's coming in. Well look at you boys. Don't you look handsome in your albs. All dressed up for the funeral! Mrs. Edward is probably looking down from heaven now, saying, "What handsome boys are serving my funeral!" She's a lucky lady! Thanks, sister. This is David. He'll be taking over for Robert. What happened to Bobby? Bobby has not made the best choices, boys, and now he's suffering because of them. Keep your prayers with him. Did sister say when Bobby was coming back? Who's Bobby? - The kid your filling in for. - I think I'm replacing him. For how long? For like, forever. No, he's coming back. That's not what sister said. How old are you? - Thirteen. - You smoke? - Uh, no. - You drink? Should we be talking on the altar? Oh, Jesus... Damnit! What the hell happened to Bobby? I don't know. He called me at like midnight, and dropped off this trunk. It weighs like a hundred pounds. What's inside it? - Where are you going? - Uhhh. We only have a couple more hours in the day. None of our teachers expect us back. Oh. I don't really mind going back. If you go back, we have to go back. You're not going to get in trouble. So where should I go? I don't know, man. Anywhere but class. Yeah, dude, just go to the baseball field or something. Oh, alright... Yo! Baseball field's that way, chief. Oh I know, I was just going to get something quick from my locker. Just fucking come with us. God damnit... Why didn't he drop it off at my place? I don't know, man. Maybe I'm more trustworthy. Dude, I'm not even supposed to be telling you this! That's some bullshit! What's inside? There's a pad lock. So, bust it off with a hammer. My parents were downstairs! I don't know, just wrap it in a sock or something. You're an idiot. That wouldn't work. Okay, how else are you going to open it? I figure we just pick the lock. Yeah, that'll work. And you'll be able to stuff the movie in your pants. No dude, that guy keeps all the movies in the back. It's just the cases out on the shelves. So go around back. Are you fucking nuts? That dude'll kill me! Bobby did that once, and the guy pulled a fuckin gun on him. That's not true. Yeah it is, man. You guys can borrow some money from me so you don't have to steal it. It's "R" dipshit. We could bribe him. Yeah, good luck. How much money you got on you? Are you serious? Look, man, I'm turning seventeen in a couple weeks. Just give me a break. You look like you just got out of diapers. Come on, man... please? You think I give a shit about twenty bucks, kid? Put it back and get the fuck out! What'd you expect? Come on, dude, I look old. How old do I look? Uh, I don't know, 14? Yeah, but how old could I be? - Uh... - 14! You look like you're 14! I look older than you! Where's he going? Don't worry about it. Hey Cheng! One all-you-can-eat buffet. How's your brother doing? He just get out of the hospital? You from Iowa or Wisconsin or something? No, I'm from California. No shit! I've got an uncle in Cali. He's an extra. He's been in a ton of movies. There was this one really funny show he was in that he was telling me about that he actually said something in. They only made one episode though, so it never made it to TV, but you know, it sounded pretty cool. It was probably a pilot. Yeah... probably. Yo! Let's just sneak the trunk out while your parents are sleeping. We can bring it to the fort and bash off the lock with a rock. No way, dude. Why not? My parents are light sleepers. We'd wake them up. Wait. Wait! Don't be such a pussy. You'll keep an eye out, while I lug it out. You can't carry it, it's way too heavy. Fuck you, man. I'm serious, we'd need at least another person just to keep an eye out for my folks. What about Felix? No, man. I'm not letting that kid anywhere near my step-mom. Especially while she's asleep. So what night are you guys doing this? We'd do it tonight. Oh. You want to help? - It's a school night. - And...? Uh, I can't hang out on a school night. Let me tell you something, Davey. If you want to make friends in this town... You can't be a pussy about every- What the fuck?! - What? - You've got to be shitting me! That fuckin' bastard! The kid who sold me the god damn cigarettes. - How much were they? - 25 fuckin' bucks. Get more fuckin' egg rolls! What crawled up your ass? Nothing! Some kid sold him an empty box of cigarettes. Oh, no. How much did they cost? - Not that much. - 25 bucks. Now that's embarrassing! Thanks a lot, asshole. Did you pay for this? - Yeah, obviously. - All of it? It's all you can eat, man. You coming tonight, or what? Wait, coming where? You going to help us with the trunk? - I don't know. - What'd I just tell you about? - What the fuck! - Watch where you're going! Fuck you asshole! Fucking cock sucker! Relax, man! He spilled all my egg rolls, that shit's expensive! I paid for the food, man. Chill out. Hey uh, do you still have that 20 bucks you borrowed from me? Yeah... um... I'm going to have to pay you back tomorrow or something. Shit! - Who's that? - Amanda Prescott. Dude! Stop looking at her, she's going to notice! Did you see that look?! Oh my god, man. You were looking at her like a prison inmate. Hey! You're that kid, right? The kid from the newspaper article? Yeah, you're in that movie! - Yeah, you see it? - Not yet. It's supposed to be really messed up, right? Some dad stabs his wife to death or something, and makes his kid watch? - Yeah, I was the son. - Oh my god, that's awesome! Why'd you move out here? To live with my mom. So what are you guys, freshmen or something? - Oh no, we're- - Yeah, we're freshmen. Right on, so are you guys going to the party on Friday? Yeah, there's supposed to be some like amazing party that some sophmore is throwing. Yeah, we'll probably hit it up. You should! Well we gotta go, but we'll see you later, movie star! Bye! You were in a fuckin' movie? - Why didn't you tell us? - What movie was it? Bloody Knuckles. Bloddy fuckin' Knuckles?! Jesus Christ, man. That's unbelievable, and you were that kid that, like, watches his dad murder his mom? Yeah, it was pretty cool too, They had him, like, stab her with a knife that went in, so it wouldn't hurt her... What are you doing home? We weren't that busy at the bar. Where are you going? I've got to go to Andy's. I gotta get a text book. Oh, alright. Have fun. Wait a minute. It's midnight. Yeah, well I've got to study, so what am I going to do? Your mom knows you're going? Yeah, and keep it down. You're going to wake her. Yeah, alright. Don't stay out all night. What took you so long? Blow me! Hold on. Alright, come on up. Are you kidding me? Hurry up! - No way! Open the back door! - Just climb! Open the... This is quicker, just climb the rope! There's no fucking way I'm climbing up your piss soaked, dinosaur, fucking blankets. Where are you going?! I'll ring the door bell if I have to. You ready? - I guess. - Just keep a look out. If any lights come on, just give us the signal. Okay... Knot's ready. Let's do this thing. Jesus, this thing's heavy. I told you! Guys. Uh, guys! Ca-caw! Ca-caaw! - What happend, is someone up? - I think so! Shit! Yo, Dave. Dave! - Yeah? - Is he gone? I think so. Seriously dude, make the signal next time! I can hardly breathe under that bed. Don't be such an asshole. You're not an asshole, Dave. Dude, stop kissing his ass. One... Two... Three! What the hell is the matter with you? Sorry, Jesus Christ. Try it again. Holy shit! Can you see inside? No, I need a flash-light. Fuck, fuck, fuck! You've got to be kidding me. Go away! Whose dog is that? It's the neighbor's. They never tie him up. - Shit! - Fuck. Are you shitting me? Alright, give me the lantern. Can you see anything? No, not really. Holy shit! Are those fireworks? Oh my god. What? What? We could use a hammer... If a rock didn't work, a hammer won't either, man. What about a crowbar? - You have a crowbar? - Yeah, good point. My dad's got a buzz saw! You know how to use it? Yeah, you just flip the switch. Where are we going? We've just got to make a little pit-stop. Do you really think this is necessary? Of course it is! Who's car is this? Don't worry about it. Wait! That'll mess up the paint! No kidding... Come on, one's enough. One? You remember what this kid did to me?! I'm going to make this one count! Dude what the hell! This kid's going to kill you! What the fuck? What the fuck?! The fuck!! Ahh! Fuck. When they show it on TV, do you get paid for that? I don't know. My parents just sort of give me an allowance. Wait, wait, wait. You didn't even get paid? My parents will give it to me when I'm older. I don't know, man. We're never going to find this thing. I saw that girl you like this morning. - Who? - Amanda, cross-country girl. Where? I think she lives near my bus stop. You guys still going to go to that party? Yeah obviously. Our buddy, Felix, said his brother could get us in. Any luck? No, dude, your dad doesn't have a buzz saw. Yes he does! Keep looking! No. He doesn't. Let's just grab some of his whiskey and hang at the fort. We're not stealing my dad's booze! It's not like he's going to notice. Fuck you, man. Hey, uh, Charlie? Can I use your bathroom? You gotta take a shit? - Then use the bush outside. - Why can't I go inside? The movie star too scared to go outside? No, I can go outside... You know that kid hasn't even gotten paid yet? What?! He says his parents are going to pay him once he's an adult. There's no way they're just going to give up a million bucks. You think he got that much? Yeah, even shitty actors are millionaires. Whatever, I would have done it just to see Valerie Rossignol's tits. He saw her tits? Yeah Felix said she showed them in the movie, and if he was in the movie he's definitely seen them. She didn't show her tits in the movie. Yes she did! Did Valerie Rossignol really show her tits in Bloody Knuckles? No! Did you get to see them in person? Shit, hide! What is she doing home? So...? - What? - Did she show her tits or not? Oh, I don't really know. Yo, I'm serious, shut the fuck up! I think you'd remember seeing those gorgeous tah tahs in person, Dave. No, I mean I don't know if she showed them in the movie or not. Tell me you saw the movie, Dave... It was "R," and it was really violent... Holy shit, Dave! What is wrong with you?! You haven't even seen the movie? I've seen the trailers and the scenes I was in and stuff. I saw the fuckin' trailers! You were in the movie. Do your parents have a copy? My dad does. Let's go get it. He lives in California. Who the fuck are you living with? Listen, it's not that big of a deal. I don't need to see the movie. It is a big deal, Dave. It's a huge deal. You were in the biggest movie of last year. Everybody saw it. Valerie Rossignol shows her tits in it. And you, the one guy who deserves to see it, hasn't. We've got to find a way to get that movie. You sure you want to do this? Yeah, man. Let's just get it over with. Alright, don't pussy out on me. Hey man, do you have that new mini-series from the Discovery Channel about the end of the world? All the movies are in alphabetical order. Yeah I was looking, but I couldn't find it. It should be there. Maybe you can help me look? Fine. Hey Iggy, I need to pick up. I'm with a customer. It's a fuckin' kid. Give me a few minutes. Yo, what do you think you're doing? Come on, dude. Please, please let me out! Hey Johnny, we don't have all day. Fuck! - Uh, I'll check the computer. - No, no. It's alright. Don't worry about it. Jesus Christ, kid. Sorry. He was just leaning against it and it fell. Well pick it up. You want me to pick it up? You expect me to pick it up? - Stop! Just stop! - Whoops. Hey Iggy, I'm going to be back in an hour. You going to be around? Just give me a minute, kid. Don't worry about it, man. We'll come back later. Oh shit. Jesus Christ! Dude, he had a gun! He had several guns, and he had bullets and knives and shit. He could've killed you! No shit, David. I had all this porn, too. Yeah? I fucking dropped it all. Tell me you got Bloody Knuckles. I wasn't real worried about the movie, man! What the fuck, dude! Who the hell locked you in there? The fuckin' douche, Ryan. He's a jerk, huh? Yeah, David he's a "jerk." So you were in that movie, huh? Yep. Did you see Valerie Rossignol's titties? Uh no. That would've been awesome. Yeah, I guess. How big do you think they are? What do you mean? Like, what size? Extra large? They're huge. I'll bet they're like double-D's. Did you see her in Thunder-Riders? Yeah, you know they digitally enhanced her tits in that movie. The fuck you talking about? Yo, check it out! Molly and Sue are sitting next to each other. What do you think they're talking about? Fuck off, man. Who's Molly and Sue? These chicks that Charlie was obsessed with. Molly and sixth, Sue in seventh... and he tried to get with both of them, but Bobby took them first. His heart was so crushed. I wasn't obsessed. Yes you were. He didn't get with Molly. He tried, and he definitely got with Sue. Bobby didn't even know I liked her! Everyone knew you liked her! And there he was with his hands in her pants while they were watching Garden State. What? I guess he didn't tell you, because he didn't want you to cry about it. Fuck you, man. Where've you been? Doctor's appointment. I've got big news! What happened to him? I told him about Molly and Sue. Dude that whole Molly giving him head thing was just a rumor... What?! Well, cheer up, man. 'Cause I got bolt-cutters. Fuckin' impossible! - Let me try. - No it's pointless. I can do it. Charlie if I can't do it, you can't do it. Fuck you! It's starting to give. It's not giving at all! Fucking impossible. No one could break this fucking thing! He has a Black Genesis! A what? It's like one of the rarest Dragon Cards. Don't tell me you play with that shit. I don't play that often. How much you think I could get for that? I don't know if you could get anything it's just like one of the best cards in the game. You can definitely get something for it. How much you gonna give him, Davey? I'll sell it to you for 50 bucks. I don't have 50 bucks! Fuck you talking about, you're a millionaire. I'm not a millionaire, it was just one movie. Yeah what's up with that anyway? Nobody wants you in their movies? No, my parents just got into a fight, so I moved back here. What was the fight about? I don't like to talk about it. Your dad didn't want you or something? No, he just got into some trouble, so I moved back here. Trouble? What kind of trouble? He kill somebody? No. Is he going to go to jail? I hope not... Woah. Seriously? I hope he doesn't go to jail... I don't know. What the fuck happened, man? There was this girl I had a crush on, she was older than me, but we hung out a lot. How old? Twenty. She played my sister in the movie. Your sister? Dude that's fuckin' weird. Yeah, I guess. Is she pretty? Yeah. ...and? I just wrapped up a scene... Cut! Doing what? You know... I'm not following. They were having- Holy shit! They were having sex?! Yeah... Oh my fucking god! Was she naked? Yeah. That's awesome. Wait, was your dad naked? Yeah that's sort of how it works. But you got to see her naked! That's fuckin' great! It wasn't. Yeah dude, he had to see his dad's dick. The fuck were you looking at your dad's dick for?! I wasn't looking at- I don't want to talk about this... What'd she look like? Alright, Charlie, cut it out. Alright, alright. Jesus, I'm just saying... You know what we ought to do? What? Bring all this shit to school. Show everybody the gun. What the fuck is wrong with you? What? You don't bring a gun to school, Charlie. That's how you land yourself in Juvi. You fuckin' retard. Okay! God... You know it'd be kind of cool though- - You're an idiot. - Yeah? Fuck you. Is that what happened to Bobby? - What? - Did he bring a gun to school or something? What are you talking about, man? Is that why Bobby's in Juvi? What the fuck? Bobby's in Juvi? That's what Sister said. Are you fucking kidding me? She kept saying I should pray for him. I wonder what he did. Hey Andy? Yeah? You look tired. I had a hard time getting to sleep last night. Is that right? Yeah, why? Is there anything you want to tell me? Like what? Like where you were last night? Come on Andrew. I heard you come in at 12 in the morning. Isn't this how your brother got started? Sneaking out, getting in with the wrong crowd? I'm not in with the wrong crowd. What were you doing? I just needed to borrow a text book from one of my- Andrew, you're 14-years-old, alright? You're not a little kid anymore. Look, I know your friends are your friends, but ultimately, you are responsible for your own actions. So what, are you going to tell my dad? No... I'm not going to tell him. Thanks... You know at some point, you have to decide who you want to be for the rest of your life. You shoot it yet? Nah, there weren't any bullets. Where can we get our hands on some bullets? Dude, the store opens at noon. Maybe it's a sign. I don't know if I want to mess with this guy. Yeah, a sign that we have four hours. Don't be a pussy-let's go! Did she ground you? She's not my mom, she can't ground me. Is she going to tell your dad? I hope not... Where's Felix and Charlie? It's locked? We should bail. Hold on. You know, Molly and Sue were asking about you the other day... Really? No of course not! Fuck you, man. Piece of cake. Oh shit. You weren't kidding. Dude, none of these are fitting, we should bail! Give me that! Bingo! Wait! Did you hear that?! Have a seat. Okay, so I know you're upset. Upset? This is not my fault. A guy smashed my window. It's not like I left the car door unlocked or something. Jesus Christ. I don't know what I'm going to do with you. Don't you factor it into the price? Factor it into the price? Like a retail store, you raise the prices to factor in shop-lifters. Do I look like I own a fuckin' retail store?! I knew we shouldn't have hired a little fuckin' kid. I'm not a little kid. Oh no? You still a virgin, big guy? - Fuck you! - Seriously. - I don't gotta take this shit. - Sit! Go ahead, tell me what makes you a man. I'm not an idiot fuckin' kid. I sold a ton of shit last week! I'm a business man, and whether you like it or not I'm helping your business. You know what happens when a business man loses his product? He gets fired. In this business, it doesn't end there. - We've got to get out of here. - Shut the fuck up. You really think you're an adult because you sell drugs at your high school? What do you do? You tell the girls that you're the big man on campus? Brag to them about all the shit you do? All the things you've done? You know what the difference between you and me is? There are things I can't even tell you. I can't even tell these guys. These are bad things that I've done. And I can't go to mommy and daddy when I have a problem. I have to solve the problem myself. And I never get caught. There's no punishment, no detention for me. This kid is gonna shit his pants any second now. I'll treat you like an adult as soon as you have skeletons in your closet that keep you awake at night, because that's what makes me an adult. That, and you know, I know what a pussy feels like. That was strike one, man. You only get two with me. Get out of here. Thanks Iggy. I got to take a shit. Dude, hurry it up we gotta... ...we gotta go! Let's get the fuck out of here! Go, go, go! Holy shit! That was crazy! Did you get the bullets? No way, man. I'm not shooting this gun right now. But did you get em? Holy shit. Let's just shoot it. Once. No way, man. I'm going home. What are you going to tell your parents? They're not home. Dude, where were you yesterday? Nowhere. What do you mean, "nowhere?" I just didn't feel like coming in, alright? Well, where's Felix? He said he had a doctor's appointment, or something. I'm glad you weren't sick. I was afraid you wouldn't make it for tonight. Yeah I don't think I want to go anymore, man. What are you talking about? You have to go! Yeah, I'm not sure about it either. If my mom finds out... Your mom's not going to find out! She'll think we're at the movies. And Charlie, Amanda fucking Prescott's gonna be there. And she knows who we are. We've got to go, man, come on! How many times have you had a crush on a chick and fucked it up? Fuck you, man. Dude I'm serious, there's going to be tons of chicks there. Maybe you could make out with one. Dude. Fuck. You. I'm just saying, you're 14. It'd be about time. ...and that's my mom's room. And this is the bathroom. And this is my room! Dude! This is sick! Does this thing work? Yeah it works! Who signed that? Oh just the director and Val... Val? You mean Valerie Rossignol? You just call her Val? Yeah. What's this? My mom wants me to get rid of some stuff. I thought you liked this shit. Nah, I mean... Not really. You don't have to stop liking something, just because we think it makes you gay. Well... You look like an idiot, man. I thought we were supposed to dress up. Jesus Christ! How much cologne are you wearing? You're supposed to smell it. You guys have a ride home, right? Yeah, uh, my parents are picking us up at the movie theater. Alright, here we are. Uhhhh. Are you sure this is the right house? Yeah the party's like a couple blocks down. - Why are we parking here? - Felix! Uh, Trent can't really walk in with a bunch of us, so you're just going to have to go around back or something. Are you going to show us how to get around back? Oh no! I'm going with Trent. Are you serious? Either walk to the party... or walk home. Fuckin' dick. Alright, the three of us just can't walk through the front door, so we'll split up. I don't want to go alone. The two of you then. Let's just go see the movie. Dave... They're not going to call the cops. Just relax. Andy'll hold your hand. Hey, what's going on? Beer pong... cool, cool. Stop bumping into me! Hey! No fuckin' smoking in the house! Fuckin' relax, man! Shit! The door's locked. - There's a doorbell... - Don't touch anything! Hey. The door was locked. Hey! You made it! No thanks to you, cock sucker. Where'd you get the beer? They ran out of cups, I stole two from the beer pong table. Dude! What the hell is in this? Wipe it with your shirt! There's a keg over there. Alright... How do I use it? You just pump it a bunch, and you pull the trigger thing. Yo, what up G? Woah, camp fire! Shut up, Dave. Oh, shit! Sorry. It's okay. Hey, you're friends with that movie kid, right? Yeah! What's going on? You hang out with that kid a lot? Yeah, all the time. Foam... Hey you don't have a cigarette, do you? Yeah, actually. Follow me! Yo Felix. What's going on, dude? Felix, dude. Felix! Hey man, what's going on? Where's the keg? Over there. They ran out of cups, though. Check the cabinets. Yeah... thanks. How old are you? Sixteen, baby. Those are my little brother's friends. Oh my god, I'm so drunk. Oh, yeah. Me too. So how old are you? Uh, 16... I just look young for my age. - You drive? - Mmhmm. What kind of car? ...motorcycle. Awesome. So your movie-star friend... Is he going to be in anymore movies? Yeah, probably. My uncle was in a TV show, you know. Oh yeah? Yeah he was really good, he said I might be in his next one. Awesome. Just take the fucking beer! Don't you have to be 18 to drive a motorcycle? Probably. I'm fourteen. Are you really fourteen? Yeah I'm fucking fourteen, how old do I look?! I don't know, you're a little... Yeah, yeah, I have a baby face. How old are you? - Sixteen. - Oh yeah? Yep. I skipped second grade. Yo, what's up? Everybody here is older than us. She wants to be a model. It's not going to happen. Why not? She's not pretty enough. Uh, she's pretty good looking. Prettier than me? You want some? What is it? I don't know. Something the guys mixed for us. Uh... Alright. You going to Richardson's party next week? Where is it? His beach house. He throws one every year. Yeah, sounds pretty cool. Ready? Yeah. Alright, so like I'll walk over there introduce myself, say a couple jokes... and then you'll walk over and be like, "Yo dude, those chicks over there were asking for you." And I'll just brush it off like I don't even need it. Wait, what do I say? Just say something that's going to make me look cool, and don't fuck it up! Where have you been? I've just been hanging out, with Lindsey Prescott! We're going to a party next week! Are you shitting me? Did you get her number? No... Dude, don't be a pussy. I can't just like, ask her for her number. How are you going to call her later? Shit. Alright, yeah... I guess. Yo, where's Andy? We're leaving. He's talking to some girls... I've gotta go over there in a second and say that he's cool. You know I can't be everywhere at once... Yo I'm serious! Leave the bitches. We're going! Charlie, what the fuck, man! I was mackin' it hard with those chicks! Yo, Charlie! Charlie! Oh my god. Yo Charlie! Hello?! Chaarlie?! Forget it, man. Let's go back inside. Why'd you do it, Charlie? Shut the fuck up, Dave. Seriously, shut the fuck up. You realize how screwed we are, right? Nobody knows who we are. It's fine. Yeah, Charlie. But they saw a bunch of middle school kids. So you know where the cops'll go? They'll go straight to the middle school, Charlie! And you'll be sitting there like a fucking idiot! It's not my fault! Oh okay, who threw a brick through a fucking car window? You sent me back in there! And there she is making out with that fucking creep! Who was? Oh Please! Like you even had a chance. You wouldn't even know what to do even if you did! Stop acting like you know more than me! I saw that girl you made out with at camp, she had a fuckin' mustache! Fuck you! You look like your 10 years-old. Stop kidding yourself! You boys have fun? Yo! What are you doing? What are you doing? What's it look like? Just fuckin' wait a minute. The fucking cops broke up the party. But not before I rounded second base with a sophmore! What the fuck, man! Charlie totally screwed me! So I was mackin' it with this chick, right? She was totally digging me, Laughing at all my jokes and stuff... And then Charlie comes in, and practically drags me out of the place. He fucked it all up! Dave! Get the fucking dog out of the house! Sorry... You should have seen Dave, man. Humiliating... Why'd Charlie cock-block you? He was crying because he didn't get with Lindsey Prescott. Amanda Prescott's little sister? Give me a break! Yeah! So he bolted out of the house and threw a rock, through a fuckin' car window! That was you guys?! The cops were all over that place! Do you know who's car that was? Yeah, Ryan Sullivan. That dude's going to kill him. I don't know, man. When Ryan came out, he made a huge scene. The cops tried to calm him down, and a bag of pills fell out of his pocket. What? Yeah, man. That kid's totally fucked. No dude! It was bullshit. They thought I stole some bitch's credit card. Did you? No. It was my buddy, Rick. And he didn't steal it, he found it. How much did he spend? I don't know, like three grand? And my parents let the cops in my house to search for everything! They fucking helped raid my room. It was ridiculous! That's bullshit. Yeah, whatever. I mean I got everything out of my room before anybody noticed. Hey, Andy hasn't talked to you about anything lately has he? No... why? I've got to talk to him about that. Hey you got any cigarettes? Uh, yeah. I've got two left. Listen, man. I might be in trouble... Hm? I might be in some trouble... Yeah, this kid fucked me over like a week ago, and sold me an empty box of cigarettes, so I- Of course he did, man. You're a push over. No man, I- It's my mom. I've gotta jet. When are you coming back to school? I'm 16. I'm not coming back. I doubt it, man. They didn't seem real worried about the window when they found out about the drugs. Yeah, hopefully. You know, they probably got those pills from the video store. Yeah, I was telling Charlie, that place is probably like a drug cover. It is a drug cover. Yeah, I know, right? No, I mean Charlie and I saw the drugs. He didn't tell you? What are you talking about? We saw them dealing drugs when we were stealing the bullets for the gun. You stole bullets from that guy?! Hell yeah! But Charlie was too freaked out to shoot it afterwards. That's bullshit, it's my gun! I thought it was Charlie's... Where are the bullets now? I've got them. You want to shoot it? I don't know, man. Let's shoot it! It's your gun! Yeah, that's not really a good idea. What makes you think that Charlie's not shooting it right now? It's your gun, go get it from him! Charlie's got the gun?! Charlie! Charlie! Look, man... I'm really sorry about- Dude, give me my gun! - Keep it down! - Where is it?! What are you going to do with it? We're gonna shoot it! I don't know if that's such a good idea, Andy... I don't care what you think, go get my gun! Jesus, alright. Where are we going? You're not coming! Why not? 'Cause it's my gun. Well they're my bullets! You should've just stayed on set that day and just waited for her to take off her top. They wouldn't have let me watch. - I was only 12. - You were in the movie! They would've had to let you stick around! Listen, I've gone along with a lot of things you guys want to do, even when they seem like a bad idea- Dave! Relax, it's gonna be fine! Let me shoot it first. My uncle used to take me to the firing range all the time. I'm a crack marksman. I'm shooting it first. Don't people jog in these woods and go horseback riding and stuff? Why don't you go home if you're so fuckin' scared, kid? Come on, man. Let me shoot it once. No, man. Back off! Alright, here we go. One... Two... Three! You've gotta cock it, man. Alright, I got it, man. I got it. Shit, that was awesome. Give it to me! I thought you were a crack marksman. Shut up! Whoa! Haha! That was awesome, man! Let me try! Yeah! First shot! What? Dave, put a can on your head. No way! I'm serious... Come on, man! It'll be harder if you're moving! Charlie! Stop! Alright, alright, I'm just fuckin' around. Watch it! Why didn't you catch it?! You don't throw a loaded gun at someone! Jesus Christ! Holy shit. Maybe we should check its pulse. It's dead, man. - We should bail. - Someone check its pulse! We gotta get the fuck out of here! What if a ranger comes by? We can't just leave it here! We've got to bury it. - No, man! - Before it gets dark. We can't bury it under the fort, dude. That's messed up. Fuck this shit! Felix. Felix! This is far enough! Just a little farther. Come on, man. This is fine. Alright. Go get the shovels. Just let me catch my breath. Dave... Don't pet the dog, it's dead. - Holy shit! - He's alive! We've got to take him to a vet! What, are you crazy?! We can't take a dog with a bullet wound to the fuckin' vet! What else are we gonna do? I don't know how to stitch up a dog. They don't just stitch up dogs with bullet wounds, man. They just bring it around back and put it to sleep. Maybe I should call my mom. No! No one's calling anyone! We can't just go running to our parents. We have to handle this ourselves. What the fuck are we supposed to do?! Dig. Are you crazy? We can't just wait for the dog to die! Chances are he'll be dead by the time we're done digging anyway. No fuckin' way, no way. Dude, that's fucked up. We have to take it to a vet! Why? So they can kill him, and call the cops, and send us to fuckin' juvenile hall? And they don't just send you there for a little while, man. They send you there for a long fuckin' time. And it'll get us suspended, and our parents'll never look at us the same. We have to do this ourselves, man. We don't have another choice. Dave, help me get the shovels. No. Dave! We got to save this dog! We have to. Where are you going? To get the god damn shovels. It's alright, Dave. We gotta do something. Maybe we should take him to the vet, maybe they can do some- Keep going, keep going! ...but I really don't think you have to worry. He's doing fine. Come on in, take a seat on the couch. I'll get Mrs. Hamilton. What did you guys tell them? Shut up, they're going to hear you. We spoke to the veterinarian and she explained the whole situation. And we just want to thank you boys for doing everything you could to help Clancy. It's illegal to hunt in those woods, you know. We're just glad it wasn't one of you kids that got killed. You boys are very brave. And we, uh, wanted to do something for you guys. Oh no, no, no. We can't take that! - Oh please take it. - We want you to have it. No, seriously. It wouldn't be right. You're David Mason, aren't you? We, um, picked up a copy of Bloody Knuckles after we read the article. Oh, cool! Yeah, nice. You, uh, sign a copy for me? Absolutely! Alright! That was brutal. Who came up with the story? Davey did. Nice work, man. Good call! Why are you so dirty? I buried the trunk. But I managed to grab this. The Green Dragon card! Thanks, man. I still can't believe they were going to give us a hundred bucks. Yeah, we should've taken it. Nah. I got something better. Jesus Christ, man! What is wrong with you? What? That's so messed up! They can buy another copy with the hundred bucks they were going to give us. I can't believe she didn't show her tits! That's fucking bullshit! But you were good though. Thanks, man. I'll see you tomorrow, Charlie. Hey! Is Andy inside? Because I need to get something from him. You mean the trunk? He told you about that? Trunk's gone, Bob. Fuck off.
