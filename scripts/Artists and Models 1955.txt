Rick Todd. Yes, sir, Mr. Kelly. Mr. Trim is here for a demonstration. You ready? Right away, sir, soon as Eugene tunrs on the smoke machine. Hey, Eugene. Hey, get up. The boss and Trim are here. Get up. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait. I'm on the third murder. Looks like the Bat Lady's gonna blow one of the Rat Man's heads off. If I end up reading the want ads, one of your heads will blow off. Now come on. Get going. Okay, okay. Oh, Bat Lady! My Bat Lady! Rick! Rick! Got me. Rick! Rick! Where's Rick? What's holding you up, Todd? Starting right away, Mr. Kelly. All right, get going. Kelly wants to see it work. tell him to come in here. Eugie! Rick! Rick! Rick! Eugie, boy, you all right? You need air. What's the matter, Kelly? She having trouble with her lungs? Look, I'll handle the smoke, and you attach the tube. Come on. Okay. - Let her go. - Okay. Wait! My Bat Lady! She's not smoking, she's spitting. Hey, what's going on here? Oh, not a thing, Officer. We're just demonstrating a new sign. Mr. Kelly, watch it. I'm sorry. Hey, Rick, I'm all set... Rick? Rick. Ricky-Ricky. Ricky-Ricky. - Yo, Rick! - What? Oh. I'm all set to make your dinner. How would you like your beans? Preferably out of the can. No, I mean, how would you like to have your beans done? Why don't you stuff them? No. broil them, medium-rare, a little mushroom sauce over them. Beans. Do you know why all we got eat is beans? 'Cause every time I find a job, you lose it. Bat Lady. You and your crummy comic books. That's all you ever think about. No, sometimes I think about girls, too. I think about girls, too. That's about all, just think about them. But can I afford to take them out? No. You Know, on account of you, I'm going to be an old maid. Do you remember why we left Steubendale and came to New York? Yeah, because you promised to marry Ophelia Jackson - and her father found out... - No, that wasn't the only reason. Oh, it was that other girl, Mabeline Smithers. - Her brother thought... - No. Come here. Come here. We came to New York so I could make money to study art, so I could become a famous painter, so I colud be hung in art galleries, so I could be hung in museums. Yeah, and you almost got hung in Steubendale. Forget Steubendale. Try and remember why you came to New York. I... Why'd I come to New York? I didn't... No. Wait. Oh, yeah. That's right. You were going to be a writer. You were gonna write children's books about Freddie the Field Mouse, Goosey the Goose, right? What have you done? Nothing. Nothing except read comic books. You also lose our jobs on account of comic books. You keep me awake every night with your bad dreams on account of comic books. You know I've decided to do, pal? - Be pals with me? - Yeah, we'll be pallies. I'm gonna write you a letter at least once every month. - And I'll answer you. - Good. Now go get supper. Write to me? Look, junior, a divorce is the only way out. We've been together too long. Ever since we were Tenderfeet in the Kangaroo Patrol. You can have the whole apartment, full custody of the beans and the Bat Lady. Okay? Not so hard. Thank you. I hope the bubbles didn't tickle your nosey. No, just my nose-tril. - Your nose-tril? - Yes, just a little tickle. Hey, you think you have enough there if I want a little slug? Oh, sure, Rick. I have everything when I'm pretending. You see, I'm just making believe that we're both very rich, wealthy millionaires with money. And you're a very, very famous artist, and I'm a very famous writer, see? And I'm just making believe that we're not even eating beans, just a big, juicy steak. Would you like a piece of my big, juicy steak? Oh, no. No, no. I'm up to here. I think I had too much vichyssoise. That's the idea, Rick. You have to pretend. See? 'Cause when you pretend, then your dreams come true. It's just like wishing. Watch. Damp. Damp. Do that once more. You see, you're not concentrating, Rick. You must pretend and concentrate. Watch. Although you're stuck beans There's money in your jeans When you pretend The wolf that's at your door Is not there anymore When you pretend There's nothing you can't be Just wish and see The world's your cup of tea Some dish, says me The happiness you find Is all a state of mind That's true, my friend And life is filled with happy endings When you pretend You sold me, junior. Tomorrow I'm gonna pretend I don't have to tour the employment agencies, okay? Oh, that's wonderful. And I'll make a real hard wish that we get a big, juicy steak so you'll have the strength. Although you're stuck with beans There's money in your jeans When you pretend The wolf that's at your door Is not there anymore When you pretend There's nothing you can't be Just wish and see The world's your cup of tea Some dish, says me The happiness you find Is all a state of mind That's true, my friend And life is filled with happy endings When you pretend You are a riot. You're a real riot. You expect me to eat that slop? So don't eat. You're fat enough anyway. You know what I'm gonna do? Do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna take that lousy steak And I'm gonna throw it out the window. Oh, good steak. Oh, Rick, come on out. We got steak for supper. Now, why don't you lay off of that stuff? - Don't you want a piece of steak? - For last time, no. Pretend you're eating it all by yourself. - Okay, if you say so. - I say so. No, impossible. Impossible! The happiness you find Is all a state of mind That's true, my friend And life is filled with happy endings When you pretend Oh, pardon me. Out of the wild blue-yellow yonder, with tail full of jet propulsion, comes Vincent, Vincent the Vulture. Vincent the Vulture, defender of truth and liberty and member of Audubon Society. He is half-boy, half-man, half-bird, with feathers growing out of every pore. He is flying to his interplanetary space station, trying to escape Zuba, Zuba the Magnificent. But Vincent is very aware that behind those inviting red lips, behind those purple boudoir eyes, and behind that cleaving cleavage lies a diabolical soul. Zuba is trying to get away from Vincent his secret power formula, X34 minus 5R1 plus 6-X36. Vincent is hit. He is hit. Zuba fires her death-dealing, atomic-atomising pivot gun. The gore is oozing out of his tail. Will Vincent the Vulture ever live to fly back to his homogenised space station high above the Milky way? Zuba! And out in space, Vincent pulls her close, but Zuba fights against the embrace of Vincent the Vulture. She is allergic to his feathers. Her teeth snarl, gleaming white. He tears her clothes and exposes her two big, round shoulders. Vincent closes in on her. Eugene. Eugene! Get me a lawyer. Oh. Coming. You'd better. Oh. - Oh, it's you, Mrs. Muldoon. - It ain't Gina Lollobrigida. Listen, Eugene, you've been flapping your gums in your sleep again, and my new tenant in 4A is complaining. Yeah, well, I'm awfully sorry, Mrs. Muldoon, but I'll apologise to him. He is a her. She's a successful artist, and you stay away from 4A. I don't want her thinking that she's moved into skid row. You mean she's an artist who makes money? Paid her rent in advance. Remember, any more noise, and you're gonna be using the kerb for a pillow. Oh, all right, Mrs. Muldoon, I'll watch it. From now on, I'll sleep with Band-Aids over my mouth. Band-Aids. Band-Aids on my... Successful artist. Maybe if she saw some of Rick's paintings... There's someone at the door, Abby. There's someone at the door. What goes on at this place? First the banshee downstairs, and now something else. I don't know how I let you talk me into moving here. Because it's Greenwich Village and it's romantic. Besides, my horoscope said this is where I'd meet my true love. Hold it. Finish this pose. What'll I say now? Good evening. My name is Eugene Fullstack, and I hear you're a very successful artist. And thought maybe that you could meet my good friend Rick Todd, who I believe is one of the better painters. And I thought if someone so successful like you would talk to him, you might just cheer him up. You see, he's getting very discouraged just hanging around. So am I. Good evening. My mame is Eugene Fullstack, and I thought... Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick, I just saw the Bat Lady upstairs, Rick! Wake up! Honest, I saw her for real on the fourth floor. Rick, I'm trying to tell you something. On the fourth floor... - Help! Help! Police! - Oh, I'm sorry. No, lady, don't yell. - It's a mistake . No, lady, don't yell. - Help! - Help! Help! Police! - No, lady, please. - No yelling. Lady... - Help! Help! - I'm sorry, lady. - Police! Help! Help! Police! The Bat Lady, the fat lady! Rick! Rick! Rick, Rick. - Rick, I saw the Bat Lady uptairs. - What? - I saw the Bat Lady upstairs. - Sure you did. She made a three-points landing on the roof. Sure. No, I'm not kidding. This is honest, really. She's upstairs on the fourth floor. Just take it easy. Look, will you go back to sleep? No, this is serious, Rick. Honest, the Bat Lady scared me and I ran into the fat lady. What Bat Lady, fat lady? What are you, crazy? No, I'm not crazy. This really happened. Let me explain. You see, upstairs is the Bat Lady. I ran up to the Bat Lady and she scared me, - so I ran downstairs to the fat lady. - Sure. She scared me worse than the Bat Lady, see? - Yeah, sure. - I was running downstairs - to tell you about the Bat Lady. - Eugie. But the Bat Lady caught me, the Bat Lady scared me. - The fat lady was downstairs. - Eugie! I ran downstairs to tell you about the fat lady. You're just having one of your bad dreams. Now, will you get back to sleep? No, really. I saw her out in the hall. She's got things sticking out of her head. She's a crazy-looking person. Eugie, you got things sticking in your head. Now, look, we'll see. Come on, I'll show you. No, no, they're out there. I'm telling you, I saw it. - Come here. - I'm telling you, Rick. For real, there's someone out there. I keep telling you. All right. Be a brave boy. Open the door and show me. There's no one out there. No, I'm scared, Rick. Scared? I thought you loved the Bat Lady. I am, but I'm scared of the fat lady. There's no fat lady, there's no Bat Lady. Now open the door so we can both go back to bed. I told you she was out there. - The Bat Lady? - No, the fat lady. Oh, you're flipping your butch. I'll show you there's no one out there. - She's out there. - The Bat Lady? No, the fat lady. Abby. Abby, look. According to my chart, it's happened. Tonight my moon is full and square to Jupiter. Uranus is square to Sagittarius, Mars is square to Venus. I saw him for the first time tonight. He's the one, my true love. Oh, Bessie, no. That square's your true love? - You tear up that horoscope. - The stars don't lie. - But isn't awful about our children? - Your children? Shouldn't you be introduced first? Well, suppose they look like him? Rent them out for Halloween. He's not very handsome. But he is kind of cute. You know, the safe kind. The safe kind? What's safe in pants? Oh, the not-so-handsome kind. They make the best husbands, you know. Other women don't want them. Listen, the man that another woman doesn't want doesn't exist. Now, lights out, girl. I've got an early appointment with my publisher in the morning. Suffering catfish! You're supposed to be an artist and a writer of children's stories. Well, you're not an artist and you're not a writer, not by my wife's standards. I knew I'd make the grade. Sixty-two pages of drawings and no blood? Not even an itsy-bitsy nosebleed? But, suffering catfish, do you call this a Murdock book for kiddies? With no stranglings, With no decapitation? Where are they? I must have lost my head, because this is where I get off. Now, wait a minute, Abigail. Abigail, please. Please, now, sit down. Relax. Let me explain something to you, honey. Now, come on. Now, listen. Well, I'm a little bit on the edgy-wedgy this morning. My wife's been giving me the knife. And if sales don't pick up, she's gonna give me the ax. You wouldn't want old Murdie boy out of a job, now, would you? I'm not Cupid, Mr. Murdock. If you can't wear the pants in your family... The pants? The pants! Since Edith and I are separated, it's a wonder I've got my striped shorts. Look at the competition we're getting in television. You realise, Abigail, night before last, I counted 13 murders, four stabbings, nine suffocations and six poisonings on two channels in one hour. And another thing... Just you think of this, girl. When they're able to show that blood, that red blood gushing out of open wounds in spectacular colour... And they'll get it free, right into their living rooms there, free, right into their living rooms, sponsored by those friendly used-car dealers. Sorry, Mr. Murdock. Get yourself another artist, someone who can bleed to suit your wife. Please, let's talk this over again. Now, come on. Now, please, Abigail, don't leave me. Oh, miss, I'm Rick Todd and this is Eugene Fullstack, and the landlady said we'd find Abigail Parker here. She's busy now in surgery. Good. We'll wait. Sit down. Look, If Miss Parker doesn't back up your statement, we're back on the asphalt, you know that? Unless you can prove you weren't trying to make time with the fat lady. What "make time"? Who's got that kind of time? I told you, Rick, I'm still all excited about when I saw the Bat Lady. - You like the Bat Lady? - Oh, Yeah. And I just found out she's for real. Sure she is. She's a living doll. - Do you... Do you know her? - Intimately. In fact, she's even more darling. in person. No fooling. Boy, those lovely lips. Those red, inviting, luscious lips, like two strips of liver gleaming in the moonlight. What's wrong with your mouth? Is it sore? No. I just thought I felt a pucker coming on. Oh. And her eyes, those magnificent eyes. What's wrong with yours? You got astigmatism? No. I was just uncrossing them. Hey, they really pay money for this kind of drawing? What's the matter with Abigail's drawing? Oh, bad, very bad. Look at all that. Look, the legs, they look like arms. You should see the Bat Lady's legs. - Oh, miss? - Yes? Your seam's crooked. Thanks heaps. - Yes, Mr. Murdock? - Bessie, I need an artist. Get me the names of the best artists that we have on file. Yes, sir. I'll bring you the folder. Did you hear what he said? He needs an artist. - Did you hear him? - I'm way ahead of you, junior. Look, when Bessie comes out, you grab her and you kiss her. - Who wants to kiss her? - You do. I gotta get into that folder, boy. Yeah, but I got a blister on my lip. Look, if you could pretend that beans are T-bone steaks, you can pretend that she's the Bat Lady. She might fight you, but you remember, you're gonna do this for your old Kangaroo Patrol pal. Yeah. Pouches forever. - Okay, kiss, kiss. Remember, kiss, kiss. - Yeah. Will you watch my switchboard, please? I won't only watch your switchboard, but I'll buzz your lights and tangle your plugs. - Come here, baby. - Not with your friend watching. - Oh, he's gone. - What are we waiting for? - My Sagittarius is rising. Hang on, boy. - No, you're supposed to fight me. - You're supposed to fight me. No! - No, no, no. Don't fight. Easy, gal, he just got some new bearings. Here, you dropped this. The stars were right. My Jupiter's jumping. Now, stout, fella. I think we're getting somewhere now. Yeah, and I think my blister's getting a blister. Look, it's smart business to get in good with the boss' secretary. Yeah? Why don't you go into business for yourself? Put more men on the job. Here she comes. Grab her, kiss her. Kiss her again! - What do you think you're doing? - Oh, I'm awfully sorry, ma'am. I thought you were someone else. He told me to kiss you, except you're not you, are you? You told him to kiss me? Lady, if I had known he was gonna kiss you, I wouldn't have sent a boy to do a man's job. That's for the man. You can tell him the job's filled. - Oh, look what you've done. - Oh, the Bat Lady. Are you Miss Abigail Parker, Miss Parker? Are you Miss Parker, Miss Parker? I'm Eugene Fullstack. - You should lay off protein. - No, that's my name. Look, I'm sorry he kissed you, and he's sorry he kissed you, aren't you, Eugie? - No, I liked that a lot. - No. Look, come here. You stay here and see if you can sell Murdock one of your stories. Maybe between the both of us, one of us might get a job. Go on. Hold it, Miss Parker. Oh, you gotta help us. My partner said he went to your door last night and saw a real Bat Lady. Yes. My model was posing. Now may I go? Well, what's the rush? I never met a lady cartoonist before. All lady cartoonists are extremely grateful. Well, I'm an artist myself. What do you say we get together sometime and compare mad scientists? I sure love the way you draw the Bat Lady. Lovely lines. I like the way your bone structure is structured. Dandy "tibialis gastrocnemiuses", also. - Going up? - Yes, down. Try sideways, then once around the park. Parker will do better, dear. She's going to do substantially better. That's what I said. Yeah, so don't fret your ever-loving fretter. I said yes! The sales of the next issue will show a substantial increase. Yes. Throw in a couple of "uh-huhs" once in a while, will you? Great Scott! What are you supposed to be? I'm supposed to be Eugene Fullstack. No, I am Eugene Fullstack. Are you Mr. Murdock? All right, come on, speak up, boy. Come on, speak up. Speak, speak, speak. Speak. What's on your mind? Spit it out, boy. Spit it out. But, you see, I write little stories for children. Children's stories, see? - And I came up... - You're... Oh, you're a writer. Oh! You have that thin, emaciated, anaemic look, bloodless look, probably very much in need of a publisher for a great new comic book. Well, why didn't you say so? Come on, now. Wipe that helpless look off your face. Come right up to me and say, "Mr. Murdock, I've got a great new idea for a new comic book. "Are you interested?" Come on. "Mr. Murdock, "I've got a new, great idea "for a new comic book! "Are you interested?" - No. No. - Oh. But wait. Wait, wait, wait. But maybe an idea growing out of the brain that probably lies behind that face may be just what my wife's separate maintenance needs. Lad, what's the idea? Give me the gist of it. What is it all about? Give me the idea. Well, you see, I write about all my little friends. - Oh, yes. - Little Goosey Goose and little Freddie Field Mouse, who live in a little corn field. Now, these little friends of mine... Little Goosey Goose and little Freddie Field Mouse? You see that little window back there, boy? Yes, sir. Open it a little. Then jump. All right. No, no! I'd like to see Mr. Murdock. Good afternoon, madam. At your service. Then you, Mr. Murdock, are responsible for my son, Richard. Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Murdock? Nice to know you. I am not Mrs. Murdock. I am Mrs. John Stilton. Oh. As publisher of "The Bat Lady", you are responsible for my son's condition. And as I am chairman of the Second Elementary School District, I am going to file a petition against your comic book. Before I do, however, I think you ought to have the pleasure of my son Richard's company While I go shopping, to observe for yourself the effect your horror literature has on undeveloped minds! Yes, but, madam, as a mother, aren't you just a little bit worried about leaving your undeveloped mind here? Your mother is the one to be worried. Well, Richard, pleased to make your acquaintance. Pleased to offer you my hand. What happened? What's the matter? Bessie, what floor is the nurse on? The second, right below Dr. Stevens' office. Thank you. Bringing kids! Who's that? This is Richard Stilton. His mother left him here for developing. Don't get too close, though. He may be poisonous. Well, he's cute. Well, Richard, What can I do to entertain you? Not a thing. You're too old for me, mophead. - Is this a dagger? - No, it's a letter opener, and it's too sharp for little boys to play with. Who wants to play with it? Richard! That's no way to behave. The Bat Lady wouldn't like that. Who cares about the Bat Lady? She's too tame. She stinks. No blood. I like blood. You touch me, and I'll throw this jug of acid in your eyes. - I'll mobilise you! - Eugene, no! I got it. Look, Niagara Falls. Why don't you two go on a honeymoon? I'll bring the barrel. - Hurry! Outside! - Yeah. Thank you for the escort. It's been dandy having somebody breathe down my neck for two hours. Oh, well, it's a dandy neck, and I wouldn't mind going on overtime. Same old line, eh, Ricky? It's a man at work. Now, look, honey, you're an unemployed artist and I'm an unemployed artist. What do you say we get together sometime and rattle our palettes around? Watch out, girl. He really rattles. - Aren't you late for something? - Looks like it. That's a friend of yours? She is now. Look, I'm sorry you're unemployed, but it happens that I'm not. I'm doing an advertising layout. So if you'll excuse me, I'll get my models and get to work. Models? Yes, models. You understand. They're people who pose. I need one male and one female. Well, now, you can't beat that combination. How about me for the male? I posed once. Remember that poster, "Send This Boy to Camp"? It was me. Maybe you would do. Have you ever posed with a girl? Not while anyone was watching. No, no, no. Hold her tighter. Be passionate. You love her. Take it easy. My back's killing me. You heard boss. She said tighter. I said tighter, but I didn't say fracture her rib case. Come on, I'll show him. Now put your arms around me. That's it. Now bend me back a little. That's fine. Now look into my eyes. Come close. Now pretend you love my Cleave-To lipstick. Pretend? You sound like my roommate. But you don't look like him. Well, that was uncalled for. I could have sworn I heard you call. I believe you should be sent back to camp, Mr. Todd. That'll be all today, Janet. We'll continue tomorrow when I can get you a professional model to work with. Okay, Miss Parker. - Bye, now. - Bye. Let's see. You worked two hours. That should do it. No. That one was on the house. It's only a sample to show you what you don't have to be missing anymore. Your humility intrigues me. Miss Parker, aren't you breathing a little heavy for just a kiss? You're not in condition, are you? What's the matther, all work and no playing around? Mr. Todd, I'm breathing heavily because I happen to be a perfectly normal young woman. My heart beats, my pulse pounds, my blood count is high. I have all the biological impulses that anybody else has. - I'm no different than you. - I wouldn't say that. I like being kissed. I love it. Under the mistletoe, in the dark, early in the morning, lunchtime, teatime, cocktail time, anytime, but I don't want to be kissed by you. Oh, hold it. Give me a chance. At least with the cocktails and the mistletoe bit. I might grow on you. See, I even fell for you. I never thought I'd ever be caught Using an old clich I'm on a spot Believe it or not This is all I can think of to say You look so familiar Have we ever met before? Everything about you Seems to ring a bell You look so familiar Have we been this close before? If my heart could talk You'd hear it sing as well There must be An explanation What I feel is not Imagination You look so familiar Now it all comes back, it seems I remember, you were in my dreams Scout's honour, Your Honour.

Mr. Murdock wants to meet me at the Stork Club, right? Hey, thanks for squaring Eugie and me with the landlady. You're welcome. She explained all about Eugene and his wild comic-book dreams. You're to blame, all that Bat Lady stuff. That's all over now. You know, I think I could help Eugene. Is he free to go to a meeting we're having tonight about comic books? Why don't you go up and ask him? He's taking a bath, but walk right in. He's got his clothes on. You know, you still look familiar. And you still act familiar. I'll see you later. - There. Todd? - Yes, sir. Sit right down. I've already ordered for you. Thank you, Mr. Furdock... Murdock. This is my daughter. Now, let's get right down to business, lad. What are your ideas? - Ideas? - Yes. You mean stories? You want someone to write them? I need crime, I need passion and even romance, that is, providing it's between your repulse characters. You want something gory, like the Vulture. Vulture, Vulture. Sounds fresh. I don't think there's any character like that in comic books. You mean you've never heard of the Vulture? well, how could I? You just told me. Well, now, come on. now. When did you dream this up? I didn't dream this up. I didn't know he dreamed original dreams. Come on, now. Stop babbling, boy. Stop babbling. Who dreams? What dreams? Come on, tell me about the Vulture, and give me that gore pouring out. Oozing out, Mr. Murdock! Oozing out of his tail! Don't pay any attention to them. It's perfectly all right. - Oozing out of whose tail, lad? - Vincent. Vincent the Vulture. Oh, Vincent the Vulture. Vincent the Vulture. Oh, I see what you mean. What happens next? Tell me. I can't tell you now. You can't tell me now. Well, why not? I gotta go home and have him sleep on it. I mean, I gotta go home and sleep on it. Oh, Eugie, you dream boy, you. The Better America Forum "is on the air". You nervous, Eugene? Oh, no, just my knees are nervous. They've never been on television before. Tonight "The Better America Forum" brings to your attention the monumental problem confronting your children today, the ever-growing threat and menace of the cheap pulps found on all newsstands masquerading under the titles of comic books. Now, to aid us in our discussion, we have enlisted the aid of Professor Samuel D. Roberts, child psychologist Mrs. Newton Geudel, Miss Abigail Parker. Miss Parker, artist and writer, was until recently herself a contributor to comic books. She knows the pressures brought by unscrupulous publishers. We've fortunate also in having Miss Parker's guest, Mr. Eugene Fullstack. Mr. Fullstack, I understand, has been reading comic books for 15 years. He has come at Miss Parker's request to give us his firsthand knowledge of what can happen to the human brain on a steady diet of comic books. Bullyoo, bullyoo Boy, have I got news for you I've got a feeling, hap-happy feeling This is my lucky day Don't want to sing the blues no more Not when I feel this way I'm gonna rock it 'cause in my pocket I got a load of green I want to spread the word around So you'll know what I mean Bullyoo, bullyoo Boy, have I got news for you I'm going to march, march, march along the avenue I'm gonna sing, sing, sing my lucky song I'm going to fly, fly, fly like little birdies do Spread your wings and come along I'm going to live, live, live it up along the way So tell me, how can things go wrong?

Hey, brother, what a heyday This has been my lucky payday And my lucky song My luck-luck-lucky song My luck-luck-lucky song My luck-luck-lucky song Thank you, and good evening. Hi, Eugie. I am here to talk to the children and to the parents of the children, because if there weren't parents, there wouldn't be children, and vice versa. What I mean is that parents are necessary if you want children, and children are necessary if parents want them, if know what I mean. if know what I mean. Eugene! What are you doing in there? I'm here to tell you how bad comic books are for you. I never thought they were bad myself until my friend Rick Todd told me how bad they were. Well, I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong. Hey. And how right he was. No, I was wrong, you dope. And I almost became a dope reading comic books. And I realise that that is why I am now a little retarded. You see, I was very slow in school. That is, the comic books made me very slow in school. As a matter of fact, I was so slow in school that I went to summer school in the wintertime. Like, for instance, the story you told me about, Mr. Baker. The five-year-old kid that was caught stuffing his grandmother in the trunk compartment of the car. An extreme example of comic book influence. Oh, yes. And any five-year-old kid should know he's not old enough to drive a car. Have comic books influenced you to that extent? Oh, I didn't learn to drive until I was eight. Now, would you say that you have learned anything from comic books? Oh, yes. Yeah. Oh... Oh, boy, yes. I learned... Particularly, I learned how to grow poison plants in a windowsill flowerport, how to keep the tarnish off brass knuckles, also, how to start a fire by rubbing two gasoline cans together. What a fire that makes. And also how to make a hangman's knot. And last and certainly, by no means, least, how to prepare rat poison so that it spreads like peanut butter. I see. And now you realise that this knowledge is dangerous. Oh, yes, it is very dangerous. yes. Oh, it's pretty... Real... It's dangerous, all right. It gave me very bad dreams. Bad? They're worth a pile! Now, what exactly did you dream? Well, that's the trouble, see? That's it, right there. I never retained anything I dreamed. I never remembered anything when I woke up, except my friend Rick said they were very bad dreams. Oh, yes. They were awful. I screamed and carried on and... Oh, it was something awful. My subconscious was battling against my conscious, and the basic intelligence of my mind wouldn't allow myself to comprehend some of the problems that were forethought prior to sleeping, and at the same time, not having any rest, because of no sedation whatsoever to make my rest and dreams any brighter or smarter than they were when I was much younger. Rick, we're home. Well, now, Mrs. Muldoon, you're much stronger than I am. We'll pay the rent, honest. Miss Parker and I... Oh, yes. I'm going to illustrate one of Eugene's stories. I know it'll sell. Sell, schmell. Eugene, your rent's paid. You give this to Mr. Todd for me. Well, what do you... What do you mean, our rent's paid? It certainly is. He gave it to me. Mr. Todd, in advance. I think Rick took that job with Murdock. And if he did, we're not pals no more. Rick. Rick? Rick? Rick. Well, where you two been? Where you been? And where did you get the money to pay the rent? Oh, I've arrived, boy. I've arrived. It's me and Rembrandt now. We're neck-and-neck. Look. - Oh, you sold the painting! - Oh, Rick, that's wonderful. That was nothing. Matter of fact, I feel another masterpiece coming on right now. What is it, curly top? Well, I feel a little ashamed of myself, Rick. I thought you got the money for doing a comic book for Mr. Murdock. Here. That's from Mrs. Muldoon, and that's from me. Thanks. Jury still out on you? Not guilty. Hey! Cute characters. Your boyfriend has a story idea for children's books. - I'm going to illustrate them. - My boyfriend? He's up to his ears with the Bat Lady. Well, you should have told him it was you. I wanted him to go for me, not for some costume you dreamed up. Well, you weren't wearing a costume when he kissed you. You weren't wearing a costume when he kissed you. But I told you, he thought it was you coming back. You just be patient. He'll stop those crazy dreams and see you for your own charming self. Our song. All right, you said that. Okay, you said it. Dream louder. Louder. Vincent flaps his feeble wings as he tries to fly back to his space station before Zuba gets to him. She looks across the water with her lavender eye and then moves in for the kill. Lavender eyes? You said purple eyes. One lavender, one purple and one magenta. Three eyes? One in the back, like a rear-view mirror. And she uses her beautiful body like a pair of pontoons. She sails across the jungle swamp, ready to sink her fangs into Vincent's jungular veins so that she can get away with his secret power formula, X34 minus 5R1 plus 6-X36. Oh, boy. Bessie? What do you suppose the stars would say about Rick? I've taken up numerology. I'm off the stars. They made me flip my Little Dipper and fall for a guy who's in love with the lady in black. I'll gonna tell him you're the Bat Lady. Oh, no, you don't. I don't want to wear a mask the rest of my life. Some honeymoon, with a pair of wings on my back. How's the numerology working out? You know, numerology's a science. I take the numbers, the day, the month and the year that I was born. I add to the day, the month and the year that Eugene was born. And that answer, I divide with my street address, then I add that to my Social Security Number, and with that answer, I divide Eugene's Social Security Number. Then I mutiply that by the number of dancing lessons I take, and the number of calories I eat in one day, I subtract from that, and then I multiply the whole thing, by now tall I am, and that's the answer. - How does it work out? - Zero. Eugene again. That still doesn't help me with Rick. Could be you're in love with Rick, maybe. Oh, Bessie, you don't fall in love with someone you've only seen a few times. I guess I'd better put some oil on you. You're going to burn. You have strong hands. Bessie? I wonder if he really likes me. I bet if he had the chance, he couldn't keep his hands off you. I love this song. Listen. If our lips should meet Innamorata Kiss me, kiss me sweet Innamorata Hold me close and say you're mine With a love as warm as wine I'm at heaven's door Innamorata Want you more and more Innamorata You're a symphony A very beautiful sonata My innamorata Say that you're my sweetheart My love - Bessie? - Yeah? Who's that singer? He sounds like Rick. Oh, you know, he's the fellow that had that big record on "That's Amore". You remember, the one... How can you be rubbing my back from way over there? Oh! I don't sing as good as he does, but I'm trying. Yes, he... Strong voice and very strong hands. You're breathing heavy again. I should have brought along my stethoscope. Oh, you're a doctor, too? I think I could prescribe something. Like a chiropractor treatment, no doubt. A little pink pill that says you can fall in love with someone you've only seen a few times. If our lips should meet Innamorata kiss me, kiss me sweet Innamorata Hold me close and say you're mine With a love as warm as wine I'm at heaven's door Innamorata Want you more and more Innamorata you're a symphony A very If our lips should meet Innamorata Kiss me, kiss me sweet Innamorata Hold me close and say you're mine With a love as warm as wine I'm at heaven's door Innamorata Want you more and more Innamorata You're a symphony A very beautiful sonata My innamorata Say that you're my sweetheart My love Hold me close and say you're mine With a love as warm as wine You're a symphony A very beautiful sonata My innamorata Say that you're my sweetheart My love Say that you're my sweetheart My Love There. Now, how's that for Freddie? Oh, he looks just like I dreamed he would. He's cute. He looks like you, Eugene. No, I'm not cute. They wanted to have me drowned when I was born, but the SPCA stopped them. I know somebody else that thinks you're cute. Oh, you mean your Bat Lady model? I can't wait to meet her. You will. She'll be dancing at the Artists and Models Ball. You'll meet her then. Oh, you mean she dances, too, like Bessie? - Almost exactly like Bessie. - Oh. Now, how about trying that Goosey Goose pose again? Oh, okay. Okay, Anita. Take five. - How's it going? - Oh, pretty good. You've changed. Now when I pose for you, all you do is draw. Rick! Rick! Rick! - Oh, yes. - Come on. Please hurry. Is that why you've changed? You change. Go get dressed. Come back tomorrow, the same time. It's Eugene. He was posing for me. I think it's his sacroiliac. He can't straighten up. Come on, quick! He can't straighten up. Good afternoon, Eureka Massage Parlour. Our rub and steam will make you dream. Just a minute, I'll check. Bring him right in here. Right in here. Yes, we can take you this afternoon at 5:30. Bye. We don't need your assistance now, son. Just put him down. Now, you run and have some alfalfa tea. We'll have him all fixed up in no time. - Think nothing of it. - Easy. - Hurt? - No. A little tougher than I thought. What have you been eating, anyway? Your diet's all wrong. All fixed up. Oh, easy. Easy, please. Oh, pain. Oh, plenty of pain. Oh, I gotta get new soles. Oh, easy. Easy. Anyone for taffy? Wait, no. Wait a second. No, lady. Look, get this foot... No, wait. This... Oh, my leg's falling off. Oh, I'm sorry. Wait, just hold everything. One second, please. Lady, one second. Rick. Rick! Wait one... My friend will... - Rick! - What is it? Here, you better get... - We're in trouble a little here. - You're in trouble? Well, I'll help. Yeah, why don't you put your foot under hers? Brace her foot up. That's it, that's it. - Just put your foot... Yeah. - Under her? - Sit here, Rick, by leaning back. - All right. That's it. Good. - That way? - No, wait a second. - No? - Come around this way. - This way? - That's it. Now brace your foot up, over. - Over. That's it. - That ought to fix everything, huh? - Yeah. - Sure. That's not working very good. Lady, lady, would you help here? You just grab... See my foot down there? Just hold it. Pull it up. That's it. Now get up on the table. Fine. Up and... Now come over. Bring this foot around here. That's good. Hold it there. Now hold my foot. And I may be able to slip this one out. No, hold it. Hold everything. Let me slip this one out. Rick, it's going to be all right. - Sure it is. - Wait, we'll get another lady. - You better... Here. No. - Sure, we need another lady. Give me this hand. Hold on there. Now let go of that foot. Good. Is there another lady? That's fine. Here, you hold onto her. Good, like that. Fine. Lady! One lady. Here, could you get on the edge of the... - It's gonna be all right. - I know. I'm fine. Get on the edge of the table. That's it. Now, look. Here, miss, just bend down over here. Here. Give me your hand. Good. Now hold onto him. That's fine. Now bring this leg over. That's fine. Bring that leg over. No, bring this leg down here. That's fine. That's it. Now get... You... Look. Just get that leg over in this side. That's fine. Wait, no. Bring it around there. Can you help her with this leg there? Maybe if she... Wait, I tell you what. I'll see you at the apartment later, huh? I don't think so. I may have lunch here. All right. See you later. Oh, what a mess. Wait a minute! Easy. It's a dime. It's a dime. That, gentlemen, is the final test of our new power formula. We can safely predict our nation will be the first to break through the Earth's gravitational pull and establish a space station. Colonel Drury here has been in charge of developing our secret power formula. I'm afraid it's not a secret any longer, General Traynor. "X34 minus 5R1"? But that's half of our formula! My son bought that at the corner newsstand last night. You can't buy a top secret at a corner newsstand. The Murdock Publishing Company in New York disagrees with you, General. Get me the Secret Service on the phone immediately. Yes, sir. Yes, General, I have the comic book before me. I'll put two my best men on the assignment. This may be a clever way of conveying our secrets to the enemy. We must find out if they have the remainder of our space station formula. Of course the United States wouldn't publish top secrets in a comic book, but the formula works to a point. It's a trap. We cannot take a chance. If this cartoonist has the mathematic equations to take a space station beyond the Earth's atmosphere, we must take the chance. All right. I leave it to an expert in these matters. My dear Sonia, where a man is concerned, you have never failed. This time you have to work fast. Get to him quickly, directly. Become his friend, his closest companion. Yes, gentlemen. I am always their closest companion. - Hello. - Hello. I'm looking for a man. Well, they never let me dress with the girls. His name is Todd. Oh, he isn't here. He's my roommate. I'm Eugene Stackfull... I mean, Fullstack. Oh, here you are. Thank you. - Will he be long? - I don't know. Is there anything I can do? I doubt it. I'll wait. I'd like to stay and check my thermometer, but I have to go see a man about a costume. Well, I tell you, we're a smash, Todd! The presses are working overtime. We're selling on the black market in Boston. I told you that that Zuba was all girl. Look at her. By the way, you've met my cousin here, haven't you? When you meet her, you meet your whole family. Family. I'm speaking of family items. Look at this. The Vulture brass knuckles. It's guaranteed, no rust. Oh, yes. And look at this, Rick. Right according to your specification, just the way you drew it. The death-dealing disintegrator atom gun. Watch this. Real nice, Murdock. Very nice. A couple more issues, and you and I will make them forget Hitler. Now, wait a minute. Don't get squeamish, Todd. Now, why don't you and your daughter and your niece and your cousin tell your wife off? I'm through, Mr. Murdock. I gotta go, go, go. - Say goodbye to your uncle. - But you... What's going on down there? Oh, Well, it seems like... It looks like Todd told Murdock off and he's leaving. Of course, I can't see so well from this rear window. - Todd? - Yeah. Secret Service? Look, I've been telling you. Eugene dreams the space formula. He doesn't know what he's saying in his sleep. We've got to know whether he's got the rest of that formula tucked away in his subconscious or not. Go with Todd. Check on Fullstack's dreams. - Take the tape recorder. - Oh, no, look. If they go with me, then I gotta go tell Eugene that I'm doing "The Vulture". Then we'll be through as pals. Can't they come after the ball, when he's asleep? All right, but I'm holding you responsible. Don't you let Fullstack out of your sight. We don't want him dreaming for our enemies. Well, I'll stick with him, sir. I appreciate your cooperation, Todd. Who knows? The President might invite you to the White House. - Oh, I doubt that. - Why? I shoot in the low 70s. Nothing. If he has the rest of the formula, he must keep it in his head. - Get him to the laboratory tonight. - Don't worry. - Well, hello. - Hello. Mr. Todd? If I'm in the right apartment, I'm Mr. Todd. I am Mrs. Thomas Curtis. Your roommate let me in. He left. You know, that's the smartest thing he's ever done. I've heard what a fine artist you are, and I came to see your paintings. Oh, it's beautiful. lovely. I like them very much. Why, thank you. That makes two of us. You see, I would like to have my portrait painted, and after seeing your work, I am sure you could do me very well. Well, thank you very much. I'll do my best. Now, what size portrait would you want, full-length or bust? Well, I had full-length in mind. I'll show you what I mean. You see, I would like to give it to my third husband as a surprise present. My congratulations to all three of them. What do you think of this pose, Mr. Todd? You could do a big calendar business. Well, if you don't approve, what do you suggest? Oh, I'm not knocking it. I think if you had this arm up a little there... That's it. And head down. Yes, yes. I like this much better. You see,I want something intimate, something I can hang over the bar. Well, with you hanging there, they won't need any liquor in the bottles. Could you start working on me right now, Mr. Todd? Don't you think it's a little late for that? We could go to my house. My husband is away, and we wouldn't be disturbed. We would be quite alone, just the two of us. - Just the two of us? - Hey, Rick! Who's gonna put the ice on my neck? Hey, Rick! If I have a neck left. Just a minute, honey. There'll be a slight intermission, Mrs. Curtis. What... Oh, hello, darling. Hi. - Where's Eugene? - Eugene? I thought I heard you talking to someone. Eugene. Oh, well, he's taking off his clothes, and he's taking a shower. Oh, well, ask him what he's going to wear tonight. Tell him the Bat Lady wants to know so she can recognise him. Okay. I'll ask him. - Hello, Abigail. - Eugene! You're taking a bath. Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm gonna wear my new costume. It's the first time I ever had my own head. - How is that, my own head? - Oh, no, you're taking a bath right now. Fine, Abigail, but don't rush me. I'll take a bath. Eugene, Abby wants to know what you're gonna wear tonight. Oh, I'm going to wear my... Who's he talking to? Yes, who was he talking to? All right. I'll tell her. Well, what did he say, dear? Well, he's gonna wear his Freddie Field Mouse costume. Oh, why don't you let me talk to Eugene? Oh, no, Abigail. He's taking a shower. You'll get all... You'll get all wet. He's taking a shower. You'll get all wet. You got dry in a hurry, didn't you? There's no one in there. Just my mother, see? It's a surprise. She's from Steubendale, remember? Oh, mother. - Mother? - Well, I can explain this, Abby. Not to me, You can't. Watch out for the bit with the suntan oil, Mother. Mother? Entertain Mrs. Curtis while I talk with Abigail. Entertain her? Wow! Here we are. You just sit right there. No, not that way. Do your Boy Scout bird calls or something. What bird call are you particularly interested in, Mrs. Curtis? Do you know the Hungarian kiwi? The Hungarian kiwi? Oh, you mean the Hungarian peewee. In Hungary, we don't have peewees. We only have kiwis. Oh, in Hungary, you don't have peewees? You only have kiwis. You don't know the Hungarian kiwi? No, I don't know the Hungarian kiwi. The Hungarian peewee, I know. - Good. - Good. To tell you the truth, I mostly know the Steubendale bird, like, the pizza bird that goes... She's gotta be a phony, Mr. Samuels. Right off the bat, she turns on her heater and goes overboard to try to get me to go to her place. I played along till I had a chance to call you. Very smart, Todd. If she didn't show any interest in Eugene, she doesn't know he has the formula. Now, keep playing along. There may be others with her and we can get them all. Here's what you do. Tonight after the Artists and Models Ball... Well, what if Mrs. Curtis doesn't want to go to the ball? What? Well, I can't do that, Mr. Samuels. I'm in love with another girl. It's my duty to the United States of America? Are you sure? If I'd known that, I'd have joined the FBI instead of the Kangaroo Patrol. Okay. Oh, boy. What are you doing, bucking for a nosebleed or something? I can't keep this dickey down, Ricky. Anybody ever tell you that dickeys went out with horse cars? If you're going to rent, why didn't you rent a modern dress shirt, something, like, about 1922? There. That ought to do it. Thank you very... Thank you very much, Rick. I gotta look real nice, 'cause I'm gonna meet the Bat Lady for the first time tonight. You know, if she's wearing a bustle, you two are gonna make a dandy-looking pair. - Yeah. - There. There. What am I gonna do, Rick? If the Bat Lady feels like kissing me, every time she'll come near me, she'll get an uppercut. I got an idea. I got an idea. Why don't you button the dickey on the top of the shorts here? See? Well, let me do it. You can't get to it. - Go ahead. - Wait a minute. Here? This button, huh? Yeah, put it right there. That'll hold everything down. All right. Oh, yeah. Hey, thanks, Rick. Good. Now hurry up. We're going to be late. - Hurry up. - All right. I'll be right there, as soon as I put my shoes on. I wonder if I can walk at all with this. Something's crooked. I think something's... Wait, this way. Over there. That's it. Something's pulling me. Yeah. I'll be right there, Rick. Hey, Bessie, you were great. It's just the numerology. Hurry up, girls. Let's go. Step on it. "Artists and Models" number. Todd, Fullstack, you're on. - And we'll be pals forever? - Pals forever. - Scout's honour? - Scout's honour. - Kangaroo Patrol. - Kangaroo Patrol.

There we go. - Hello, Henrietta. Eugene? Hey, Eugene, what are you doing? Well, if ask me, he's making time down the back elevator with a bat. Oh, wonderful. He went with Bessie. That's great. - Bessie! What happened? - Where's that dame? She stole my clothes. - They've gone. - Whoa! I can't go out there like this. Put this on. - Did a bat and a fat rat come out? - They just left in that foreign job. Come on. Let's get going. Bessie! Hurry! - Coming. - Come on. Here we are, darling. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, but where are we? Where we can be alone, darling. Wow! What a place to grow orchids. Oh, darling, you look so tired. Why don't we go upstairs where you can take a nice nap? Your voice sounds very familiar. I think we met someplace before. Here. Now, get to the nearest phone, call the Secret Service, - tell them where we are. Come on. - Yes, sir. This sure is a cosy place you have here. This is our little nest. You could breed locomotives in this little nest. - Are you all right? - I'm all right. Just get me a new liver, that's all. Come on. We gotta get over here. Come, darling. Let's go upstairs. Come on. Come, come. Come on. Oh, boy! Come on. Come on. There. Here we are. There. Oh, you look so tired. Let me help you with this. You need some rest. And by the way, what are you keeping that mask on for, Miss Bat Lady? Mystery lends enchantment. Well, if I want mystery, I watch "Dragnet". First we'll have a drink, darling. Here, sit down. I'll be right back. I'll have celery tonic on the rocks. This will do it. To us, darling. To our troubles. May they never be little ones. Are you wearing that mask because there's something wrong with your nose, possibly? There's nothing wrong with my lips. - There's something wrong. - What? Well, when Bessie kisses me, the tops of my shoes pop open. - Would you mind if I tried again? - No. Thank you. I'm sorry. Bessie's the one. Sorry. Well, then I wish you all the luck. Here is to Bessie. I'll drink to that. And you're a good loser, I don't mind telling you. A real good loser. To Bessie Sparrowbush.

Eugie, wake up! You're sleepy. So sleepy. - Oh, sleepy. - They're in the garden. Hurry up. He's up there. Zuba comes after Vincent. She sinks her teeth into his goose feathers.

Ivan! Kurt! Otto! They're up here. Sorry, we don't need any. Don't shoot. Remember, we need his dream. Where did they go? They took him away. He was yelling "kangaroo". Spread out. Find them.
