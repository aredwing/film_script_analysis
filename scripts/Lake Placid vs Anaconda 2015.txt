We almost finished here? You don't want to spend too much time in one place. Once one croc spots you, they all come. This place is infested. Shut up, old man. These animals are gonna make us all very rich. So just be patient. We're beginning the procedure now, gentlemen. As long as we're getting on with it, I'll take my money. That wasn't the deal, Long John Silver. The deal was that I get you and your people in here. I did that. The deal was you get us in and out. All right. This is only half the numbers. Yeah, Mama didn't raise no fool. You'll get the other half when I get my money. All right, it's just a little stick, sweetie. Why are you talking to an anesthetized croc? It's an old habit. From my hospital days. I don't understand why we can't just take this stuff back to the lab? And why does that snake have to be here? What we're doing here is very precise. Yikes! Once we've altered the structure, the manipulated DNA becomes very fragile. So, an immediate implantation into an egg-producing female will give us the best chance for success. She's ready to lay her eggs. They just need to get fertilized. Now, these two smaller male snakes will provide the catalyst for the procedure. Fine. So the snakes will mate. Get on with it. Can I at least see the money? Excuse me. Watch the hook, man. Aren't you gonna count it? I trust that it's all there. I'd thumb through it, but no thumb. It's an awful lot of cash just to get you to open a gate. And to keep my mouth shut. You see, without the proper motivation, I might just be tempted to call Fish and Wildlife. Bet they'd be real interested in exactly what you want with those protected crocodiles. You give Ms. Murdoch my regards. And boys, you all be careful with these crocs. Take my word for it. First bite's always the worst. - Jim, we ain't done here yet. - Firearms. And you still owe me the last three numbers. - Okay. - Pardon me. Crossing. Watch the gun. No problemo. I'm injecting her with the mutated cells now. Finito. What now? Now? Now we wait for the new cells to take. This female snake is genetically engineered which means that all of her biological process has been accelerated. She'll grow faster, molt faster. Lay eggs faster. Got it. How long? She should lay her eggs in the next 24 to 48 hours. Dear God. Great. Wake me up when it's time to go home. We'll get her back to the lab and everything else will be done in an incubator. Okay? Our friend here is awake. That's not possible. I gave that thing enough tranquilizer to knock out an elephant for 12 hours. You know this isn't an elephant, right? It's getting loose. It's getting loose! The snakes! Shit! Shit. Hey, Tully. New sunglasses? Nice. You know I can see the deer, right? Deer just jumped out in front of my truck. What about the one in the back there? I forgot. There was two of them. You sure that's the story you want to stick to? It's the God's honest truth this time. Isn't that a bullet hole? Looks like about a .308 there, wouldn't you say? A .308? I don't know anything about ballistics. Ballistics? That's a real big word for you, Earl. I'm impressed. Don't worry. I know it wasn't you that shot him. Earl Junior! Why don't you come out from behind that bush over there? Let's have a little chat before I have to cart your old man off to jail. He's just a kid, Tully. You're scaring him half to death. Poaching is poaching, Earl. You know the deal, the fine or the time. The fine. Have a nice day. That ain't no way to treat a citizen! First beer's on me later. Have you seen her? Have you seen my baby? Daphne! Daphne! Have you seen her? She's missing. - My baby. - Get away from me, lady. - No. - Sheriff! Sheriff, stop! Have you found her? Have you found my baby? We're pretty sure that she's with Jared, Mrs. Mailer. No, Sheriff, what if she's not with him? I told her to stay away from that piece of trash. I'd cut that sucker's balls off myself if I... If I could do it legally, that is. She's really a good girl, Sheriff. Yes, yes, I know. She's been an absolute doll since she got out of jail this time. But, Sheriff, it's been two days. I'm not stupid. I watch reality TV. After the first 48 hours, it's practically a cold case. Okay. Well, we're doing our best to locate her and I promise I'll be in touch as soon as I hear something, okay? Thank you, Ms. Mailer. - You have a good day. - Thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Sheriff. Mr. Mayor. What was that all about? Her daughter went missing. Last seen? Hiking outside the fence at Black Lake. - Outside the fence? - Yes, sir. Is this something that I should be worried about? Because if it is, I'll have to call in a prescription. The daughter is a grown woman, sir. We think that she took off with the boyfriend. The mother's not too fond of him. But, we are considering other possibilities. Good. I gave you this job because you know the town, its people, and to make sure that the crocodiles at Black Lake don't cause any problems. You gave me this job, sir, because nobody else wanted it. I sent Ferguson down to take a look. Ferguson? I have complete faith in your abilities. I'm behind you all the way. But if you screw up, I'll throw you under the bus in a heartbeat. - Steve, how are you? Nice to see you. - Mr. Mayor. Thanks for the building permit. Remember, it's an election year. Ice cream! The mayor has coupons for free ice cream! - Coupons for free ice cream, everyone! - What the... Sheriff, can you hear me? Yeah, Ferguson, where are you? Is that you? Yeah. Go ahead, Ferguson, before I kick your ass. Yeah, roger that. We are combing the perimeter fence just like you instructed. Find anything? Yeah. Yes, ma'am. Is it Daphne Mailer? No, ma'am. You need to see this for yourself. Okay, since we're playing this game, secure the scene. I'm on my way. Roger that. Secure the scene! I can't believe she would use this picture of me. Yo, Daphne! Open the door. Wait, I got the key. - Where the hell have you been? - Hey! You scared the hell out of me. Look at this. Cool. Look at the picture! I look like a pig! My mom picked the worst photo she could find of me. Boo-boo, you look good. Good and fat. No, you look good, real good. You look hot, you look sexy. Girl, you look smart. Wait, you really think I'm smart? Yeah, you got a GED. You know, there's something I really like about a guy that appreciates me for my mind and not just my body. Okay. Baby. What? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Come on. - Baby, you said you like it rough. - Yeah. Sorta. Okay. Baby! Okay. Just a little less. Yeah. - Where have you been? - I've been walking all night. - What do you mean? - They got out. What do you mean, "They got out"? They're loose. - Get to my office immediately. - Roger that. Whose fault is that? I ain't taking the fall for what went on out there. I'm not asking you to take the fall, Mr. Beach. But you will help me get them back. Wait, I'm gonna what? Those snakes are a very rare, very endangered species. They are monsters, is what they are. Yes. Well, they also represent billions of dollars to this company. Have you ever heard of the Blood Orchid? Can't say I have. It's a tropical species. Very rare. My father discovered that the orchid extract, when mixed with the particular secretions of a molting giant anaconda created a compound capable of regenerating cells. Cell regeneration? I'm talking about biological immortality, Mr. Beach. Imagine what people would be willing to pay to live forever. Anything. But there was a problem. A protein bond triggers cell regeneration in reptiles. Unfortunately, it doesn't work the same way in humans. So, how does it work? It becomes lethally toxic. Do I still have your attention? Absolutely. Before he died, my father found a solution but it required creating a hybrid. And with that you get your fountain of youth? Unfortunately, the only compatible reptile on Earth is as rare as the orchid itself. A species of crocodile. Enormous, aggressive. And they can only be found one place on Earth. Yeah, I know. I fought with one. Gather your men, Mr. Beach. We're going back there. We're gonna find that snake before she lays her eggs or someone or something gets to her first. I need those baby crocacondas alive. You're listening to Monster Rock on Q95. You're listening to Monster Rock on Q95. There's no way you got 2,200 on your SATs. I did. I swear. I'm, like, a genius. No. Actually, you're like, terrifying. - It's so wrong. - Whatever. I only got, like, 1,900. And somehow they still let you into vocational school. What about you? What'd you get on your SATs? Right around 2,350. - What? - What? You're full of it. Hey, hey, hey. Don't hate. Yeah. Goody, it's Tiff! Hey, big sister. Put me on speaker. Everybody needs to hear this. Okay, bitches, it's time to put down your phones and that copy of Girl Mag and listen the hell up. My phone. The bitch can't talk right now. Are you slow? Slow? No, no, I'm seriously asking if you're stupid. Like, mentally challenged? Because I need to know what I'm dealing with. I mean, seriously, what the hell do you think this is? What I see in front of me are a bunch of stupid little girls who think they have what it takes to become Delta Phi Beta sisters. And I can tell you right now, they... - Are wrong! - Are wrong! You are some sorry-ass losers. If you want to get in, you're gonna have to prove yourselves. I thought I had lost you, my little friend. Are you calling your boyfriend? What's his name? Maybe I know him. Since when did you ever need to know a guy's name before you do him? Whatever. This is Tully. Hey, Dad. Hey, sweetie, how are you doing? What ya doing? I just stopped by the house real quick to try and grab a quick snack. You miss me yet? Of course I miss you, honey. I mean, you're off at college and then I'm here all alone. I think they call it empty nest syndrome. Shut up, you probably already turned my room into a man cave or something. Yes, indeed, I just hung a flat screen up in there. Got it all cleaned up. Put a La-Z-Boy in there. I got a little mini fridge. I am set for football season. You have no idea. That sounds great. All you need now is a dog to lay by your feet. I would love that. So, what's up, babe? Just keeping to our agreement. Checking in. Thought I'd let you know that I'm going to rush weekend with the sorority girls. Right, I completely forgot about that. Where you guys going? We're going up to Clear Lake. You don't have to worry. Just do me a favor and just let me know when you're heading back to the dorms, okay? Okay. All right. I love you. I love you, too. - Goodbye. - Bye. I'm hungry. I'm gonna go back to the truck and get a snack. Hey. Bring me some Cheez Doodles. Okay, Dad. Anything but crocodiles. Please let it be anything but crocodiles. What the hell is going on here? Well, yeah, the forensics are still going over it. But it could be arson. Arson? Does this look like arson to you, Ferguson? Maybe not. Find any bodies? Daphne Mailer, maybe? Well, we have one... - Ferguson, just a little personal space here. - Sorry. We have one partial set of human remains. What isn't still attached is probably inside the... - You know... - The crocodile? You can say it, Ferguson, just not too loudly. Well, while we're here, we might as well be sure. Cut him open. I'm not really good with, with sharp things. But I can get you a set of gloves. No, no, that's okay. My hands have been in some pretty nasty places. Okay, bag those up. Get me some DNA. I want to make sure that they don't match our missing person. Yes, ma'am. Hello, everyone. - Hey, Mayor. - Nice to see you, Bob. - How's the game going? - Good, sir. Working on the handicap? - You got it. - Good boy. What the hell is going on here? I heard the call on the scanner in my office. Okay, I have it under control. You call that under control? I don't call this under control. And you're gonna call Fish and Wildlife before anybody gets what's going on around here. I don't have to tell you that November's just around the corner and my ass is on the line. Just take care of it. All right, everybody, the mayor is leaving. See you later! - Bob, take care. Remember, Sunday picnic. - Yep. - Bring the kids. - You have a good day, too. - I'll be there, sir. - Keep up the good work, everyone. All right. Sweetie, two times in one day? I do have unlimited minutes. Sweetie? Do I know you? I am really sorry. You know what? I thought you were my daughter. Could be. My mom dated a lot of guys. What? This is the Aroostook County sheriff. Am I speaking with Will Tull, Fish and Wildlife? Yes, this is Will Tull. My friends call me Tully. Well, Tully, I'm Reba and I don't have any friends, so you can call me Reba. Yes, I'm familiar with who you are. I think I'll stick with Sheriff for now. How much do you know about crocodiles? - Did you get another tattoo? - I totally did. - Let me see. - I had to. - Oh, my gosh. - It's just small. - I didn't want anything really big. - This is really good. What do you think this is? A vacation? You are all useless. All right, bitches, on the line! Get on the line right now! That's better. I happen to know that none of my DPB sisters or brothers at Kappa Tau Pi are gonna want anything to do with any of you if you all suck. And right now, you do. That's it, you're out. You didn't make it. Come on. Leave! I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. You can get back in line. Get back in line! Now get in the water. I don't think any guy minds if we suck, if you get my politically incorrect innuendo. What are you all waiting for? Are you afraid of the crocodiles? I cannot believe you are all this stupid. This is Clear Lake. There are no crocodiles in Clear Lake. The crocodiles are in Black Lake. Now get in the water! Go on. Get your asses in there! Where do you think you're going? - But you said to... - And what was your name again? Jane. Jane? As in plain Jane? As in Goldsburg. You have 20 minutes to dig a hole big enough to bury your sorry ass in. Are you both deaf? Or maybe you really don't have what it takes to become a Delta Phi Beta. I've got my eye on both of you. Is that even possible, to have one singular eye on both of us? I don't think so. It's gonna be fine. It's so cold. Move it. You don't want to piss her off. Let's go, guys. Go. It's a beach, bitches! Walk until you can't touch the bottom and tread water until I say stop. Go! Looks like Megan's already halfway to becoming a sister. That's it. Keep swimming. Let's hear it for Brett and Andrew from Kappa Tau Pi! Go, guys! Great performance, guys! Oh, my God. Are you okay? That was crazy. Bro, that was awesome! I'm sure the girls will show you their appreciation later, if you get my meaning. All right! I'll give you 10 seconds to move your vehicle. I'm here meeting the sheriff. It's your lucky day. You found her. I know. I'm Will Tull. Fish and Wildlife. Tull! Just the man we've been waiting for. You still got to move your vehicle. Oh, boy. Here we go. So, you have an ID yet? No ID, but I can tell you the legs do belong to the rest of him. How can you be sure? You'll have to forgive me. This is the only time I have to eat my lunch. Wing Ding? Thanks, but no. You can tell by the break. Clearly the legs were torn off with tremendous force coming down on the femurs. But here, you can see how they match. Yeah. And you're absolutely certain that he's a he? No question. Well, how long before you can give me a name? I got no usable prints. Possibility of dental records, but that could take weeks, even longer. - All right, thanks. - Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Did they find what was left of the lab unit? Even if they have, there's no way they can connect it to us. I made sure. You better hope so for all our sakes. Eyes front. So, what's the plan? What a bitch. A couple of days ago I had our tech guys block their tracking device so only ours will work. So we're the only ones that can track these things? Bingo. We'll use this to find the female and bring her back to the lab. And if we can't? This is a portable incubator. If we can't bring her back to the lab, we'll take her eggs. Whatever happens, we can't have her lay them in the wild. Those eggs are the key to the serum. And what if she does lay them in the wild? I don't want to know. I guess we're gonna need Bickerman again. No one knows the land like him. Well, he does have a bag full of my money. I think it's about time Captain Hook earned it. The good news is it's not our missing person. The bad news is that our missing person is still missing. Finding a dead guy inside of a croc isn't bad news enough? Spend a little time with us, Mr. Tull, and you'll find that it's just another day at the office around here. What'd you got on the tractor trailer? Unfortunately, not much. The license plates melted in the fire. Can't even get a readable VIN number. The guys at the garage are taking it apart to see if they can get some serial numbers off the engine. Might be able to trace it from there. All right. Well, keep on it. Yes sir, ma'am. I mean, Sheriff. Sheriff. Mr. Tull, what do you need from us to get started? Well, first things first. Probably best to go ahead and show me what you've got. Boo! Oh, my God, you scared me. Well, with your ear buds in and your eyes closed, Sasquatch and his whole family could sneak up on you. Here, it's the only thing I could find to actually drink. Thanks. Unless you want to join the vomit patrol over there? I'm okay. Okay, let's do it. Neanderthals. I'm surprised they don't drag them off by their hair. Why are you here? You don't seem like the type. What, can't you tell that I live to be a Delta? Paint each other's toenails, call each other sisters and BFFs? Compare each other's boob jobs? - Stop. - Get a daring butterfly tattoo on our ankles. - Okay, stop. - Pierce our unmentionables. Seriously, stop. Really, why are you here? Truth is I'm a psych major. And I mean, what is more psycho then wanting to join a sorority? Great resource material. I'm bored! Make them swim. Get in the water. Come on. Go. Go. Get in, bitches. News flash, you stupid bitches! Frats don't like boring sorority sisters. Now, get in the water! What about you, girlfriend? What's your excuse? I'm a legacy. My mom was a Delta. So, what, she, like, forced you into it or something? No. She died when I was little. It was just me and my dad. So I thought that becoming a Delta would be something to remember her by. That's sweet. I mean, I want to throw up. But it's sweet. Seriously. Don't think I don't see you two sitting over here snickering or laughing or whatever. You do know that those words mean the same thing, right? What I do know is that you are two of the sorriest pledges I have ever seen in my life. And if you want a hope in hell of getting into this sorority, you better get it together. Well, let's take one for Mom and my studies. This is a mess. - This happened last night? - Right about then. We don't get many eyewitnesses out here in the middle of the night, which, I'm sure, was the point. I'm not gonna candy coat this for you, Sheriff. If this fence was down for even an hour, it's entirely possible that some of the crocs escaped. I mean, there's a chance we can track some of them, but... Then what are we waiting for? Well, I mean, you obviously know a lot about breeding. Excuse me? That came out wrong. Let me clarify that. Aroostook Station Wildlife. Hey, Sheryl, it's Tully. I'm out here at Black Lake, just trying to take my foot out of my mouth. You do that a lot, Tully. If you could do me a solid and get Falmouth on the line and have them send over all the transponder numbers for the crocs they tagged out here on their last survey, that would be great. And if you could make it snappy, I would be very happy. We could have a very serious situation on our hands here. - I don't know, I'll pass it on. - Okay. - Yep. Thanks. - Tully, what about that raise I... Okay, bye, bye. Bye. Bye. What I was saying earlier is that any crocs that were born after they were tagged aren't gonna have any transponders. So we're gonna have to hunt the old-fashioned way. And if we're gonna do that, it's gonna take a lot more than that peashooter to stop 'em. Don't you worry about me. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's stopping crocodiles. So I've heard. All right. Here's a list of all the transponders that they tagged the crocs with. Looks like a lot. Yeah, but this is not right. This is last week's readout. Hold on. What the hell? The whole system went down. Is that normal? Well, it's never gone down on me before, so to speak. There's a first time for everything, I guess. - That's kind of convenient timing. - Not really. Well, I mean, a bizarre accident blows a hole in our security gate around the same time the tracking system goes down. We don't even know how many crocs have escaped, if any. True, true. We don't know how many escaped, but we do know where they're going. Check this out. Pull up this map. All right. This is us. And here's Black Lake. Now I'm willing to bet they've probably consumed most of the lake's resources, so, the crocs are gonna be headed toward the nearest source of ready food, which is right there. Clear Lake. Hey! Where do you want us to start? Start in there. That's where we found him the first time. If we're lucky, he'll be drinking his way through that money we gave him. You two wait out here. Try to blend in with the locals. I'll go around the back. What's up? What's up? Come on, Beth, answer the phone, please. Look, just try to relax. You know, she's probably out having some fun with friends. Besides, we don't even know if the crocs did escape or even if they made it to Clear Lake. Look, I'm not gonna be able to relax until I know my daughter is safe. So, I'm gonna go look for her. We're working here, Tull. Once that fence is fixed, your lake is safe. I can't say the same thing about my daughter. So, I'm gonna go try and find her, you can come or not. I'm coming! I was never here. You got it, boss. - Hey, buddy, what can I get you? - I'm looking for Jim Bickerman. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim who? I'm still having a hard time with that last name. Bickersteen? Bickerman. Jimmy Bickerman. Why didn't you say so? Haven't seen him. Hi, Jim. Happy hour start a little early today? Don't hassle me, Ms. Murdoch. I'm a cripple. Physically challenged is the preferred term now. I'm sorry. Did that hurt? Come on, Jim. We still have business to discuss. Let me help you up. Did you see that? I think I got me a lawsuit here. - He's actually kind of cute. - Yeah. You ready? - Born ready. - Yeah. Ladies, Andrew is gonna give Hannah here... - Heather. - Close enough. A show to remember. Damn, it's cold. - I'm gonna go up front. - Yeah. Baby, you know tops are optional on my boat. Does that line really work? Well, I am the captain. You handle the throttle. Hit it! Yeah, baby. Let's go over there. What? I'm serious. You're so much hotter than the other girls. How about a little suck face? Stop. Stop! Stop the boat! Why? What's wrong? He's gone. He's gone! Something attacked him. I think a giant alligator or something! Yeah, yeah, he's probably joking around. - I'll circle back and pick him up. - I'm sorry. I'm allergic to water. He'll be okay, all right? I don't know. What the... Very funny, Andrew! That was a $200 rope. Maybe we should get back to the beach. I can't leave Andrew in the middle of the lake, joke or no joke. Not again. Cut it out. That's not funny. We've seen this before. Andrew? I did not give them permission to get out of the water! Oh, my God, they're gone! Melissa! Oh, my God! Help me! Go, go! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Go, go! - Help me! - No, Heather, no! Melissa, help me! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What do we do? Tiffani! I don't think we can outrun them! - God! - Wait! I have an idea! What? Help me! No! Need I tell you that you're going just a tad over the speed limit? - Write me a ticket. - Don't tempt me. Ferguson, you out there? Come in. Ferguson, come in. - Excuse me, bro. Official police business. - Ferguson. - Just, just one minute. Thanks. - Okay. This is Ferguson. Who's this? It's your mother, Ferguson. I need you to get out to the Clear Lake Marina and get everybody out. The lake is officially closed. Blame it on red algae or brain-eating amoebas. I don't really care. Just don't let anybody hear you say the word "Crocodile." We don't need to start a panic. Am I clear? Roger that, Sheriff. Ix-nay on the ocodile-cray. Where's my... Okay. Come on! Come on! Hurry! Get in the car. - Where's Amber? - I tried to save her, but she didn't make it. What? Oh, my God! Wait. You can't come in this car. - Why? - I don't like your bikini. That's it. We're leaving. God, can you believe it? I left the keys on the beach. You mind going back and getting them, big sister? What? Are you nuts? Come on, come on, get out of here! Why aren't they leaving? Go! Go away! Yeah, that'll work. Just tell them to leave. I'm getting out of here! No! Cassie, no! No! She's not gonna make it. Better her than me. - We got to help her. - I volunteer... - Her. - Why her? It's not like she's gonna get in anyway. Do you try to be a bitch or does it just come naturally? Our only hope is Tiff's car. Okay? We go on three! One, two, three! No! I got you! I got you. I got you. We got to distract them. - Who's got something we can use? - Like what? I need a can of hair spray. Something flammable. How about spray tanner? Somebody must have left it there. That'll work. Who's got a lighter? Guilty as charged. Help! Help! They're gonna... They're gonna... No, they're not. It's okay. When I say the word, just be ready to run, okay? Wait a second, I'm in charge here. I say the word. I'm listening! Hey! Over here! Now? Now! Now! Now! Oh, my God! I'm not getting a signal. We must be out of range. It's a snake skin. One of them is molting. It's too big for the males. It's come from the female. She may be ready to lay her eggs. - We know one thing for sure. - Which is what? She's still growing. Yeah, like she wasn't big enough already. Move out! I'm fine. Just fine. Thanks for asking. Okay, sorry. Sorry. People of the visitors' center, I need you to leave the premises right away. There is absolutely no reason to panic. Sorry. There is no need to panic. Everything will be okay. By order of the Aroostook County sheriff, I need you to all remove your vehicles and exit in a calm and orderly manner. There's no need for pushing and shoving. Get out of the way, nerd boy! Be polite, people! This is a major emergency! Run! Your life may depend on it! Stop. Stop! What is it? Sheriff... What the hell is it? It's crocodile prints. That tracker of yours showing anything around here? No, no, no. It's still not working. I left it in the truck. That's weird. Where the hell did that thing go? Do something! Working on it! Oh, my God! What's that? Where you going? Damn! Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff, stop! What are you doing? I'm going after the snake! Hell, no. I'm not about to become part of the food chain. I'm going back to the truck to find my daughter. What? Come on. Come on, this way. I'm coming. I'm coming. I got a bum knee. Sheriff, this is Ferguson. Sheriff, you copy? Yeah, I hear you, Ferguson. Go. This is Ferguson. I know, Ferguson. You just radio-ed me. Yeah, I just wanted you to know that the visitors' center is secure and I've locked all the perimeter gates. Roger that. By any chance you come across a group of sorority girls out there? Negative, Sheriff. Just a bunch of families. Why? Did somebody else go missing? I'm with Tull. Meet me on the fire road. We got another problem. Does it involve a C-R-O-C? Now, Ferguson! Roger that. Oh, my God. Damn it! Still no answer. I've never seen anything like that in my life. No, me neither. I mean, it... It had to be an anaconda. The green anaconda, that's the largest species in recorded history. That thing wasn't just large, Tull. It was, it was ginormous. I know. I saw it. I can't explain it. I mean, I've heard stories of these snakes getting to be 50 or more feet long, eating cattle and people. But this is deep down in the jungles, and they're just legends. Maybe not. Well, even if it's not a story, they're indigenous to the Amazon. What the hell are they doing here? It had to have come from somewhere. It had to be a person who brought it here. Great minds think alike. How did it get so big? I don't know. That's the least of my worries at this point. You need more? My daughter is still out there. And any of these snakes could be out there with her. And here I thought the crocs were bad. We can't just stay here. Maybe we can. I mean, someone will figure out we're missing and send someone to find us. Right? That could take days. We'll starve to death. Trust me, some of you girls could stand to lose a little weight. Oh, my God. Do I have to do everything? Switch with me. Okay. What are you doing? You were serious about stealing cars? All better. Let's go. How'd you learn to do that? When my dad wouldn't lend me his car. And that is why being a DG is not in your future. How will my life go on? Drive! - I don't know... - Where are we going? Oh, my God, watch out for that tree! My goodness! My goodness! Damn it! Back up. There has to be another way. Come on! What are you waiting for, Tiff? Just drive! Oh, my God! Everybody out! Now! - Get out! Get out! - I can't go out there! I can't! Wait! Where's Jennifer? Oh, my God. - She's still inside! - What? We have to get her out! Oh, my God. Hey, get off of there! Get off! - Yeah, that's smart! Piss off the giant snake! - Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Someone! I'm so sorry. Hey, you did everything somebody like you was willing to do. What am I going to tell my dad? He just bought me that car! If something happens and I don't make it, do me a favor. Kick her ass. First on my bucket list. - What is it? - There's something out there. It's not showing up on here. Maybe the transmission got damaged somehow. Or maybe it's something else. Don't shoot it. It's a federal offense. What's it doing? Hunting. Hunting what? Us. The hell with this! He's dead. Let's get moving. She could lay her eggs any time. We can't just leave him here like that. We can't take him with us. He'll just slow us down. He knew what he was signing up for. He have a family? A sister. Send flowers. Let's go. You do realize she's a sociopath, right? It had crossed my mind. Any new leads on the sorority girls? - Space, Ferguson. - No, sir... Sorry. You guys are covered in blood. There are only really two usable beaches along the shoreline. Everything else is just too rocky, too many trees. There's one along this path and another one round back all the way over to the other side. That one's more popular with the local teenagers. If you, if you get my meaning. - Show me. - Okay. Yeah. Okay. Oh, my God. Beth! What the hell happened here? Bethany! - I'm gonna go check the lake. - What... I'm just gonna... - Ferguson! Let's go! - Just gotta get my gun. Okay. What's an abandoned boat doing here? Ferguson, go check the boat out, okay? We're gonna check the shoreline. Let's go. What the... I need you to focus. Okay, I'm gonna ask you again. What happened on the boat? Who else was on the boat with you? Think. I don't know. Andrew was wakeboarding and... Okay, but who else was there, all right? I'm looking for someone. Okay? I'm looking for a girl, 5'4", blond hair, blue eyes, named Bethany. Bethany Tull. - Her name is Bethany! - Okay, relax, Tully, okay? I don't remember any other girls on the beach! Are you here for rush week? Are you part of the sorority? I'm looking for my daughter, damn it! - Tully, come here! - I told you I don't remember! Take it easy, Tully. Can't you see that the girl is hysterical? You're not gonna get anything from her, not now. - I know. I just... I'm sorry. I lost it. - It's all right. I'm sorry. Everything will be okay. I promise. I promise. It'll all be okay. It's okay. Get her to the hospital, would you? Okay? Okay. Hey. Hey. Now let's go find your daughter, okay? Come on. I got something. Signal's pretty weak. She's far. How big is this lake? Well, this is about as wide as she gets. Goes down that way another click or so before it hits the Clear Lake Dam. How do we get there? Well, let's see. Well, we could take the roads or go back over land. There's a boat. That'll do. I believe that's a tad too small, miss. I'm sure you've heard that more than once in your life. I don't think that belongs to us, Ms. Murdoch. I don't care what you think. Now are you coming? Or are you giving me my money back? What the hell? Something crushed it like a tin can. There's no way a crocodile could do this. You and I both know it wasn't a croc. Where are you going? I'm gonna find my daughter before that snake does. Just another day at the office. Lower your throttle, you goon. You're going too fast. Don't listen to him. Speed up! That's a hell of a lot of wake. So? So, a big wake, lots of splashing, tends to attract crocs. I got bigger things to worry about than crocodiles, Mr. Bickerman. Yeah. That's what you think. What the hell was that? We hit something. Or something hit us. I don't have time for this. Move! Can you even drive a boat, lady? What are you doing? We have to go back. We have to go back. Hey! Hey! Murdoch, you bitch! - Help! - Hey! Turn the boat around. We got to go back and get him! We're not going back. You want to save him? Feel free to go for a swim. That's it. I've had it. I'm taking a break. We should just keep moving. I don't care what you do. I need a minute to catch my breath. No, no, she's right. We should just stop. Let's just stand here so the giant snake can catch us. I don't think it followed us. What we need to do is find our way back to the main road. Get your weasel ass up and keep moving. The only way you're getting into this sorority is over my dead body. Dare to dream. All right, girls. Two minutes. And then we try to find the main road. Just keep an eye out. Crocodiles, snakes, who knows what else could be out here with us? Lions and tigers and bears, oh my. Brings me back to my wonderful, yet nightmarish, childhood. Anybody else hear that? Yes. Oh, my God, something's out there. Anyone want to bet it's not a cute, little, scary-ass munchkin? Maybe it's a search party. Maybe they're looking for me. Whatever it is, it's coming this way. If it is a search party, they're not leaving without me. I didn't think there were any crocodiles in Clear Lake! Well, there's your search party. That's not funny! What do I do? Just don't move. Don't move. No! Nobody messes with a DG sister! Oh, my God! What the hell? - Run! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God, run! - Beth! Dad! Dad! Oh, my God. I thought I lost you. I knew you'd come for me. Of course. I'm gonna go home and reenact that to my dad and evil stepmom. Listen, this is real sweet and all, but we'd better get moving. I can't argue with that. - Come on, let's go. Let's go. - Okay. All right, Beach. You've had that look on your face since we got off the boat. What is it? Nothing you need to worry about. I'm putting my mission and my life in your hands. If you have a problem, then hell yes, I need to worry. I didn't like him any more than you did, but we could've pulled him out of the water. No one around here is gonna miss Jim Bickerman, believe me. Besides, he's probably fine. There wasn't that much left of him. He was a loose end. He was right. You are a sociopath. I'm not a sociopath, Mr. Beach. I'm a person trying to protect her father's legacy. He spent most of his life perfecting the Blood Orchid serum and I intend to finish what he started. Make no mistakes. I will gladly sacrifice anyone or anything that gets in my way. Including you. Nice to know where I stand. Just keep doing your job and you'll be fine. This was such a gigantic mistake. I should have pledged Omega Kappa. How much further is it? This is not my neck of the woods, I am lost. Relax, Tully, I know where we're going. All right. Sheriff, this is Ferguson. You copy? Roger that. Sheriff, can you hear me? I copy, Ferguson. Is that you? I give up. I give up. According to this signal, she's right here somewhere. We've been flushing them out toward the choke point. There's no way out. I'm telling you. She's right here. What do you mean, right here? The only thing I'm seeing out here is you, me and Mr. Happy. I'm telling you, she's right here. Where is it? - That's not her. - What do you mean, that's not her? That's the male. Then where the hell is she? Don't shoot it! Damn! You'll kill him if you shoot my snake! What are you doing? I told you I wasn't gonna let you kill it, which is what I'll do to you if you get in my way. Over there. Don't you ever do that again. Now, come on! What the hell was that? I don't know, but it's big. Let's move. Come on. Wait a second! We need the tracking device and the case, you idiot! And I'll take my gun back. This is Ferguson, over. Lot of movement down here. Crocs and snakes, over. Ferguson, where the hell are you? I'm in a back path somewhere trying to find one of the crocs. And I think I can hear something. Can you hear this, Ferguson? You're hearing us. You're hearing us! - Turn around! - What? Got it. No grip on my shoes. Come on. Okay, got it. - All right? - Okay. Nobody move! Ready to fill your freezer? You got a full clip? Never leave home without it. Hey, how dare you point your guns at my snake? I'm the sheriff, lady. Who the hell are you? I don't care who you are. You're not killing my snake! You see, I'm the one who says who kills who and what around here. Right now, you're on my list. This is a controlled animal reserve. Drop your gun and tell your henchmen to stand down. Let me just educate you a little bit. Those snakes are the property of the Wexel Corporation. You kill them and I am gonna sue the town of Lake Placid into bankruptcy. It's gonna be a little tricky, don't you think, to attract tourists to a ghost town? Now, I'm gonna put him down for a little nap. My extraction team is gonna bring them back to the lab. And you and your little college field trip can do whatever you want with your crocodiles. Beach. Extraction Team, this is Black Lake recovery. Get ready for extraction. Read you loud and clear. We're here. Then again, Beach, kill the damn crocs. Don't let them kill the male. What the hell was that? After everything I've seen today, nothing would surprise me. Hello? Except that. She's here! That is one big-ass snake. That's my girl! On my coordinates, gentlemen, prepare for snake extraction. Roger that. We have eyes on you. That's okay, baby. You will all be home soon. Looks like your extraction team just got extracted. - Ferguson! - Yes, sir. Get my daughter and her friends to safety. I'm not leaving you here. I'll be fine. - Just go. Go! - Yeah, okay. Come on, let's go. And if things go south, get 'em the hell out of here. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Just kill the damn croc! - Kill it. - Oh, my God! No! Don't kill my baby! You really are a psycho bitch! Damn it! Girls, don't watch, don't watch. Don't watch! Oh, my God. Bye, bye, baby! No! Oh, my God. This is really starting to get disgusting. God! God! I'm all right. I'm all right. - Oh, my God. - Okay. God, that's disgusting. When my lawyers are through with you, you'll wish you never met me. I already do. Trust me. When she's done with you, you and I have some business to discuss. Yeah, good luck keeping your badge. Good luck being someone's bitch behind bars. Ferguson, cuff her. Yeah. I left 'em at home. Sorry. - Here. There you go. - Sorry. - Ferguson? - Yeah? Good job. Space, Ferguson. Tull. This is why your tracking software was on the fritz. Back in the day, we used those to track tagged animals and jam the Feds. No kidding? Far out. This is great. I mean, I can get all the crocs back in the reserve now. Finally, some good news, huh? Dad! Babe. So, Dad, I know I said I would join Deltas in honor of Mom, but do you think it would be okay if I didn't? I don't think that she would mind a bit. Besides, you honor her every day by being so awesome. - I love you so much. - Thanks, Dad. I'm so glad you're safe. Hey, guess what? Get in the truck! Later, gator. It's not a gator. It's a crocodile. Whatever.
