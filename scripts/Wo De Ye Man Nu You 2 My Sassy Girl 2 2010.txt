What kind of girl am l? Would the real me be the same as those guys thought? Miss, give me back the ball, please. Thanks. Miss, thanks. A month ago, I came to a strange city in a maze then I bumped into this Korean guy and had an inexplicable beginning. Hello. Hello. Do you mind exchanging your seat with me? My girlfriend and I used to sit here every time. Today... I'd like to propose to her. So I want to take this table. Miss, do you think it's okay? If you plan to propose to her today, why didn't you prepare that in advance? In fact I did reserve it, they just made a mistake.. Alright. Thanks. Hello! I suddenly felt like sitting by the window. I'm not familiar with the food here. Just give me some recommendations. Dare you not proposing to her in other seats, I wouldn't marry a guy like you if I was her. For those who are in love, they would have the same sweet smile on their faces. But the story behind that, would it be the same? Come on. Luka. Come on. Luka, come here. Don't look at me, just care on your cooking. Look here. Luka... Alright, don't cry. Don't cry. I miss him so much... Stop crying. I will buy you another one. Fifi... Fifi! Fifi. Fifi. Fifi, marry me, please. Who is he? Let's talk about it in your bookstore tomorrow. Fifi. Fifi! Fifi! Fifi. Fifi, is it because I'm not good enough... for I'm just running a small bookstore? That's not the main problem, the problem is... we used to go to the same restaurant for all these years and having the same seat and set meal. Do you think this is normal? Don't you like that restaurant though? Will you watch over a hundred times for a great movie? I will. I got it, let's go to another restaurant then. That's not the point. I need another relationship. Get up! It's you again? It's me. You're not dead yet. Stop! Don't run! Hurry... Come back! Shoes... my shoes... Don't run! Run! I'm so dumb. I'd think of suicide whenever I got a broken heart. Are you out of your mind? Right, I still have my bookstore. What's this? E-book. The number of books that can be stored in this... would be over a thousand times than your bookstore, got it? I understand, I'd expand my bookstore. No, you should expand your world. You'd go to places you've never been to, do things that you've never done. Like what? For you're so innocent... I trust you. Then? Then... I need your help, I want you to be my assistant. I'm going to punish someone. Who? Listen, our relationship is not like what you think. We're just having artistic communication and interaction. Stimulating inspiration for each other. Do you agree? I do. Sorry. I didn't want to betray you though. Please forgive me, okay? I'm trying really hard... to be forgiving. But you just betrayed me again and again. Am I being too good to you so you don't cherish me? Sorry. In fact, I do want to marry you. Then you won't leave me like this. I don't want marriage. I'm leaving. When will you back? Never. I will never let you off! You don't have to be upset for me. I can't. When you Iove someone... you would see him wherever you are. I understand. I don't. Your place is so big. My grandparents left this to me. Where's the guest room? No rush, I have to clean the bath tub first. I'm so blessed. Can I come in? Hey! What are you gloating for? Don't you want me to bathe? I clean the bath tub for you to sleep. Go to bed early, you have to buy things tomorrow. Buy what? A DV cam, for filming a tragedy. What tragedy? A screwed up wedding. A miserable bride, a confused groom. Where could I buy a DV cam? I don't know the road here. You're not here for a tour. You'd look for yourself, don't rely on me. Give me the key, it'd be convenient for me. No. Hey... Kin Yu. Fifi. Fifi. I'm here. I got it, you're in my dream. Kin Yu. Ho Chi Hoi! Boss. I lost the match, I'm upset. What a poor guy! He used to be bullied by his boss. Who is he? My cousin, who is a Taekwando coach, will tell you. I have been busy thinking about a guy who had hurt me before. He once said he doesn't want a marriage. But now he's longing for a grand and extravagant wedding. And... he will pay the price for this. Mr. Yeung. Where's miss? She's in the bedroom. Yao. I think... we shouldn't get married though. Why? Many people said you just love my money. Is that true? Yes. You're so humorous. To love someone... you have to love every part of her. It's just so happened that I'm rich. Even if I forsake the money that I have, you will still love me, right? No more wild fancy. It's not a sin being rich. I have to buy a DV cam, just take me to the MTR station. No way, get off! Aren't you going the same way? You do your own work and I do mine. Hey... Cousin. Bumping into my big mouth cousin at this time, hope that she won't tell anyone about my thing. You're here too? Yeah.. That's great, I thought you would be upset for quite a while. Never thought you would recover so soon. Recover? Didn't you get dumped by that guy/ Who told you that? Sorry, I made a mistake. Not you, it's someone else. Cousin. Do you think he did love you before? You'd better ask him. Give me some advice on this some other day. Is it the same girl? Yes, this is my cousin who has been dreaming to be the best heroine in the world. Your left kick hit on the left. Sit down. Sorry. Hands on your knees. Straighten your back. Tae, that's kick. Kwon, that's punch. Do, that's propriety, justice, honesty and honor The spirit of endurance and restraint. Miss Wing Chun. I was once in the MTR, a guy tried to... Do I have to take that even a man tries to molest me? Of course not. Attack his vital spot. Good! Well done!... Excuse me, is that so funny? Do you how a girl would feel when she got molested by a man? I know that. You know? Did you get molested too? Twice. By a man or a woman Both. Public morals are declining. I show deep sympathy for you. Stand up. Raise your arms, one. Two. One. Two. One. Two. Three. Four. One. Rhythm! One. Two. Three. Straighten your back. Four. One. Ease your shoulder. One. Two. One. Straighten your back. Two. Three. Kin Yu. You bought the DV cam already? It's so expensive to buy a DV cam here. Stop talking about money. Practicing yoga. makes you feel perfectly calm now, right? Yeah, even if someone makes bad comment on you, I won't get mad for that. That's good. Remember, when we are being attacked, You have to... Contract my anus and adjust my breath and get into our world. Let's get tighten a bit. Stand still. Step back. Lift up your knee. Lift up your knee. Twist outward. Toe to the front. Kick out. Straighten your body. Lift your leg. A bit higher, turn out. Get up. Sorry, miss. I got your ankle twisted. It hurts. I know that. You have to hold the board like this. So that you won't get yourself hurt. Miss, I was wrong. Is your face hurt? Yes. But... it's so sweet here. You're making fun of me? I'm a woman, you're a man but I can still hit you Be careful, miss. I didn't make fun of you, l... Iike you. Like? Why? Because you are so beautiful. Your beauty is torturing me everyday. What's your intention for saying that? No. I want to woo you! Woo me? Why? I would go for it as I like. You are so daring! What's your name? Miss, my name is Ho Chi Hoi! What do you do? Magician? No, I'm a bra designer. Why do you wanna learn Taekwondo? Try to be more masculine! Miss, your beauty to me, it's just... You're so disgusting. Well, I love your innocence and seriousness. Let me tell you. When I really love someone... I would be so devoted to it. Dare you woo me still? But it's not whether I dare or not. You're already in my heart. But no one ever dare to woo me. I would! Welcome to our Xiang Jiang Safari Park.

Let's have dinner at my place. Okay, let's go... Go... Come on... There's a guy looking at us suspiciously. I should have seen him somewhere. He's the guy we saw in Chime Long. It seems to be. Come in. Let me introduce. Uncle Kin Yu. Hi, uncle. He's my new part-time maid. Get the laundry done, go. Okay. Do you think he looks like the guy we saw just now? What do I look like? I couldn't remember his face. But the clothing is similar. Where are you from? I'm... You are so interested in him. Are you from the head hunt? We dare not. Well, uncle. how is your pay for a day? Not much, it's enough for buying a banana. So cheap! In fact, I need a part-time maid too. Please give me your number, so that I can find you. Don't be lavish. Just give me the banana then. Wash the glasses, go. Idiot. Sister, you shouldn't be so rude to your maid.. He's human though. Sheung Chun, I'm gonna tidy up your bedroom. Hey... Hey! Come down! You can't go into my bedroom. Come down! Cousin, don't try to cover up. Come on, let's talk. Have a seat. Cousin, although uncle is not that good, he seems to be a man of good temper. You do know that? I also know that it'd be suffering being a boyfriend without a status. What did you say? He's not your part-time maid for sure. Who is he then? Who is he then? A boyfriend without a status. What do you mean? You both use the same shampoo. I can even smell that! In fact, our relationship... is quite complicated. Let's go. Uncle Kin Yu. We are leaving. Please come down. Bye...See you. Bye-bye... Nice meeting you. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. See you. Bye-bye... By the way. Uncle. Should I give you my number? Okay... You could help me out. Let's have a drink some day. Have a chat or watch a football match. Alright, but I used to watch that with my cell phone. Because I am quite a boring person. I could get along well with boring person. Come on. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Come here! What is it? Don't move! What is it? Don't move! What's wrong? Don't move! Why did you use my shampoo? I bought the shampoo myself. Yours is used up already, I bought a new one. Do you know how much I spent on this home? Home? How much? I bought the battery for the remote too. I bought the DV cam that got taken away too. Dare you say that! You were so stupid that you screwed up our plan today. Think of a new plan then. Should we write a blackmailing letter? Right, we should write it with blood. That would be effective. Bite your finger. Why? We need blood. Why me? Should I use mine though? Hurry! Stupid. There's a suspicious guy down there, you check it out. Okay. Who are you looking for? Coming in to threaten us? Wrong door. Raise your arm. Is the referee blind? That guy must have bribed the referee. Re card! You're eliminated, go! Why didn't you say stop, Miss Wing Chun is so hurt. Do you know how to be a referee? You are too unfair! Miss Wing Chun, you're so great. You shouldn't continue the match, okay? Why did you bring a bra along? You're insulting me. And you're insulting Taekwondo too! Am I dead? Don't worry, you're doing fine. Thanks. Miss, you can go inside. Are you alright? Don't get closer! But l... Are you trying to hit me again? I'm not gonna hit you. Go away! I won't. Go away! But... Okay, you don't go, I go. Hello, Chi Hoi? Alright, stop crying. It's not my fault! She loved me in the wrong way. See how terrible she hurt me. Forgive others means forgive yourself. That will ease your mind out.. I can't forgive her! A real man wouldn't forgive her. Kin Yu, ain't I masculine enough? How could I be a real man? In fact... I'm not a sample good man. I have no money and I am not mature enough. How could I make my loved one feel secure? Maybe it's not our fault though. I think now the sense of security that women want is not protection but a kind of domination Let's dominate them. Okay. From now on, I will be a playboy. Without sincerity, then I won't get hurt. Right? Yeah. Cheers. You were exhausted yesterday, it's been tough for you. Not really. How could that be possible? You were wandering in my heart all day, you must be dead tired. It's for you. Thanks. Let me show you a trick. Come on, give me your hand. Magic! Chi Hoi, you... What kind of magic is it? No feeling at all? I already put my heart into yours. When did you start... using this in courting girls? In fact... you're not my cup of tea. She is not my cup of tea too. Chi Hoi... Sorry. When were you up to? You are not my cup of tea. Why did you promise to come to my date? You keep sending me lingerie, I'm here to thank you. In fact, I have been treating you as my friend. If you treat me as your friend... you should introduce a girlfriend to me. Heard that you had a broken heart? Can't get along anymore then it's better to break up. You got beaten up by your girlfriend too? Is she a tyrannizer? No. Again? Run. Run... Well.. Sorry. I think... You didn't know how to jolly her otherwise, she wouldn't beat you up though. Maybe she's just a tyrannizer. I don't wanna hit anyone and I don't wanna be hit too. I think we shouldn't meet afterwards. Then... have you got any friends introducing to me? I don't think you are looking for love. Are you trying to have a one night stand? One night stand? Sorry. I have never refused to one night stand. But I dare not trying it. Do you have anyone that can introduce to me? Be honest, for one night stand... I do have one that I can introduce to you. One night stand? It means after that... you can't take me as your girlfriend, okay? OK No exchanging background, name and secrets. OK We can't keep in touch afterwards. I won't. OK. Let's go! Now? Well, sometimes one night stand... needs to be established with some feelings. I'm Fafa, fake name. And you? Chi Hoi, real name. Chi Hoi. Let's have a date tomorrow. Chi Hoi, this is the Chime Long Resort. It's so fun just now. You go by yourself, I have no feeling at all. Why? Do you have a heavy heart? You can tell me, I will be your super audience. Don't be misled that I'm so coquettish, in fact, I'm a Ph. D to-be in Psychology. I could be your psychiatrist. Then I have something to ask you. Go ahead. Let's say, I fell in love with a woman. Sometimes she is so gentle, but sometimes she treats me as enemy. Is that her problem or mine? Is it my problem? It's not only your own problem. Love... at the beginning, it used to be romantic. Whatever everlasting and unchanging, it depends on whether the couple could Iove the faults of each other. Faults? I just know to love her merits. I never thought that I have to love her faults. Can you love my faults then? In fact, I am a woman though. Woman... I didn't know that you are a woman. Are you teasing on me? You are just satisfying with your own male chauvinism... and you are longing to be taken care of. Okay, I will accept your faults. I would give you a kiss. Help!... Why are you here? Are you following me? You have been keep fighting all day... Only you know Taekwondo? Do you know you are insulting Taekwondo? No, you are insulting martial arts from all over the world. No, you are insulting yourself! I'm not gonna hit anyone. I saw you got kissed by someone. You don't know how to say no, I will do it for you. It means you're protecting me now. Well... I am the other woman though. You ruined my first kiss! Ho Chi Hoi! Get lost! Slut, don't ever let me see you again! You just know using violence? I didn't use violence just now. I mean your expression, your attitude. You tend to oppress others. This is a kind of subconscious violence. I can't bear to see you got bullied by others. Anyone who bully you would be my enemy. Last time, I hurt you. So I am an enemy to myself. You know what... My heart has been... killing me until now. Let's stop bullying each other, okay? Can you guess how he would propose to me? And how would my wedding gown look like? Is that so important? Of course. Woman never wore a wedding gown before, her life wouldn't be completed. Wedding gown? That's right, every bride would care about her own wedding gown. Miss Kwok, Mr. Yeung has been waiting for you. Please come with me. Welcome, is there anything I can help? Is it a bridal wedding salon? Yes. Hubby... We are here for the wedding shots. Congratulations, this way, please. We have different selections. What kind of style do you like? Honey, what do you like? Hubby, you make the decision. Hubby. So beautiful. Excuse me, I gotta go. What are you doing? Let go! It's my wedding gown... Someone help!... Stop there... Give it back to me! What are you looking at? Help me! Run! Have you heard about a legend before? What? As a bread falls on the ground, the side with the stuffing would be fallen first. Never heard that. Let me show you. I stained the gown. Have some coffee. Cheers! I can't do anything about it. She is quite pathetic though. Wedding gown, you would wear that once in a lifetime. If it was you, won't you be heart broken? What's up? You saw her wearing so sexy and you have pity on her? She's not the one who hurt you, it's her fiance. I think you dare not facing him directly. Because you still love him. I still love him? I would find him and give him a slap that he owes me. Who is it? It's me. Where have you been today? I know you did that. I don't want the wedding gown. Come to my place, I have something to talk to you. Okay, bye-bye. What did he say? He knows you did that. He wants you to go to his place. I will go with you. Who needs you to go with me? I am your assistant, I should go with you. I could apologize for you. Apologize? Please. Make it quick. Why do you have to ruin our happiness? If you marry him, you won't be happy. Tell me, how bad is he? He had countless girlfriends before. Because he's so charming. He's dating two girls. It's because he's so kind-hearted, he wouldn't reject others. He's a gigolo. It shows that he's not a chauvinist. He says dirty words. Every man says dirty words though. I don't. Are those women blind when they are in love? As I see you now, I would hate the old me. Why are you comparing with me? Because you failed. Does it mean that I would fail too? Don't be so opinionated. I will mess up your wedding for sure. Who is gonna mess up my daughter's wedding? Dad. Dad. Don't be scared. Don't shoot! Don't mess around! I will call the police! Don't be scared, they are just back from hunting. Did you say you are gonna mess up my daughter's wedding? Yes. You too? I... Yes. Don't shoot! Today, I have something to announce. In fact, love should be the thing only between us. But it's been a mess now, so Yao and I decided that we won't hold any wedding ceremony. I would throw this gown away so that you won't think of those unpleasant memories. Go away! Are you alright? Why did you make the floor so slippery? It hurts. Hey! Why didn't you wipe the floor? Lazybones. It'd be fun for watching comedy. I wanna cry though. Can you hug me? Aren't you gonna say something? Stupid. Miss, what are you looking for? I'm looking for Ho Chi Hoi. Wing Chun, you are here? I'm off, let's go. He's my boss. Hello, sir. Is... is she your girlfriend? Yes. Girlfriend... We gotta go. I won a match today. Let's go to the pub, on my treat. Let's go... Thanks, boss! Come on... You dropped the dice, drink. Let me. Wait. Don't drink the baby stuff, drink this. Come on. Why did you find such a stupid guy? He's not stupid, he's honest. Honest means stupid, doesn't know how to lie. A good guy doesn't lie. Alright...don't talk about this... Let's go on, come on... Well, that's enough for today. Mary... Yes? Give me your bra. Why me? Not the one you are wearing, the one that you designed. You scared me. It's here. Here you go. Chi Hoi, put it on. Help me. Boss, let me do it. My body is pretty good. Thanks. You will have the chance. You put it on after he's done. Go ahead. You are the most feminine one in the company. You! You leave first. You better leave too. Your girlfriend's legs are so weak, how could she walk? You can say that I'm sissy. But you can't insult my girlfriend! It's for woman's protection. It's not for fun. You are not qualified to make bras. You are not qualified to be a man too! You don't have to come to work tomorrow! You go back by yourself, I'm taking the MTR. Sorry, I can't be your boyfriend anymore. Why? What have I done? You shouldn't find such a useless man to be your boyfriend. No, I think you are smart. You think I am smart because you are stupid. I can't protect you though. I lost my job now. I can't even support for my own living. I can. I can take care of you, I can protect you. Will you marry me? What are you doing? Get up. When I bought this ring, I had been thinking that you would propose to me one day. But now, I would use this ring to propose to you. Will you marry me? Well, you deserved to have a better man... I would judge for myself. If you do, then you should... Why didn't you leave? I'm not busy though. You don't have to be here, go away. I'm not gonna count for what you owed me. What did I owe you? You can see such a beauty as you get up everyday, how are you gonna pay me? You keep getting me upset for your stupidity, how are you gonna pay me? I have no chance to meet other guys for living here, how are you gonna pay me? You better leave, you can't help me anything. Come on, just sign it. What kind of chit is this? How are you gonna pay me? This chit has no validity. Stop your sweet talk, you would forget me in two days. Please go away. Sheung Chun... Stop bothering me again. I like to be alone at home. Just leave me alone, okay? Sheung Chun. Sheung Chun, open the door. Sheung Chun... Sheung Chun! He lied to you, he said he didn't want a wedding ceremony. Now, he's gonna hold a cohabiting party. Sheung Chun... When would the party be? Sheung Chun, I've never helped you anything. I want to give that guy a slap for you. You go? I go! Hey!... This is Mrs. Yim. Congratulations. Hello. It's her husband. Hello. Hello. Hi, everybody. Thanks for coming to witness Mr. Yeung and Miss Kwok in starting their happy living together. First, we should appreciate to the new couple for preparing little gifts for each guest. That's the products from Shu Lei and Mei Tao. Why did you offer those gifts? That's the gifts from my friends, everybody would be happy for that. Happy? Happy. Happy. Let's present our roses and blessings to the new couple. What's up? You are not gonna give up though. Well, what are you gonna curse on us, just say it. I must give you a slap! Go ahead, I joined the army when I was in Korea. What's your relationship with Sheung Chun? You should advice her. You hurt Sheung Chun so much! She did love you before, how could you be so unfaithful? You really want to slap me? Right! Don't move! Don't move! Who do you think you are for hitting me? Sheung Chun's boyfriend? My relationship with Sheung Chun is so pure. Sheung Chun is the one who get hurt. If I have to be punished, she should be the one to slap me. You don't have to do it for her. No need, she authorized me. to do it for her. In that case, I have to slap you first then I would let you slap me. If you really want to help Sheung Chun, that's a way. I would do anything for her, a slap means nothing to me. I would slap you in return though. Well, let's... Come in. Sheung Chun wouldn't see it even you got hit. What for? I would tell her the details as I go back. In fact she really cares about me. Good. What do you mean by saying that? Who would care about you? In fact I don't have to hit you. Because you don't deserve that. From now on, I would disappear... from your world forever. Hubby! Let's go. Stop pretending. It really hurts. No one cares whether you are hurt or not. Let them get ran over as they go! Don't you remember? What should you do when you are mad? In perfectly calm. Contract the anus. I know you won't care about a useless guy like me. I have to go to the airport, you are not going the same way though. I know I used to be a boring person. I would even hate myself though. In fact, I am an unreasonable and overbearing woman. I would even hate myself sometimes.. You can change. You haven't changed though. You don't even love yourself, who would love you though. Sheung Chun. Can I give you a goodbye kiss? When you fall in love again, you shouldn't ask your girlfriend such a stupid question. How is Wing Chun doing? Terrific. That's my girl. Do you guys really fall for each other? It would be great if Uncle Kin Yu was here, l really miss him. Do you miss him? Hey! Why didn't you wipe the floor? Lazybones. Aren't you gonna say something? Stupid. Kin Yu, you punk! Where did he go? I have no idea. He left as he handed over this shop to me. Kin Yu, you know what? The girl who might have hurt you came to your city again. She remembers everything you said and your every silly smile. She also remembers the lonely receding back as you left. Kin Yu, I am here. Where are you? When you Iove someone... you would see him wherever you are. I know that. I don't understand. I mean, when you walk on the street and you see other people... they are all your loved ones. This is illusion, not love. This is love, not illusion.
