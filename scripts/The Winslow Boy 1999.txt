Pharaoh's dream of the King of Egypt. Seven fat years, seven lean years. Good sermon. -Exceptional sermon. -I couldn't hear him. -Can one be good and inaudible? -A problem in ethics for you, Father. -Not everything is ethics. -And the seven fat cows... ...were devoured by the seven lean and hungry cows. I feel like those lean and hungry cows. My point precisely. Lunch in about an hour, sir. My, it's going to rain. I could've told you that. I feel it in my leg. -Would you mind the gramophone? -The centre of a well-regulated home. It helps me concentrate. Concentrate on what, pray? Catherine? It's all right, Father. -I wanted to see about-- -To study. -To study. -What did you say? I said the gramophone, the music of the gramophone helps me to study. Study is not what you were involved in when I came downstairs last night. -Your friend and you. -Edwina, Father. Edwina had just stopped by to-- She stopped by on the way from Graham's for a book. And you are involved with her in what? A sort of what? Reading club? I must say I believe I have a right to a certain measure of autonomy. Sorry, what were we discussing? Edwina. What a fast and flighty little-- I'm sorry. You're keen on her. You would've had ample proof, Grace... ...if you'd seen their attitude last night. -We were practising the bunny hug. -The what, dear? -Is that what it's called? -A new dance. It's like the turkey trot, only more dignified. Good sermon, miss? Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dreams. More like the fox trot. Fox trot or the kangaroo glide. Whichever animal is responsible... ...for the posture I found you and your friend in last night-- Or to make an end... ...l doubt... ...l doubt the gramophone aids you in what you call your studies. -I see. It all comes clear to me. -Yes, it's raining. May I see it? It's not about the gramophone. It's about Ronnie. I wouldn't have thought it of you. I certainly would not. And at this festive season. At this festive season, to throw it up to me, to bring that up again. -Nobody's bringing that up. -They are. Ronnie got into Osbourne, as I did not. Why? As he applies himself. And Ronnie-- Dickie, do you have a coin to give the fellow? No, sir, I have not. And if I may, I'm going to my room. I might suggest you take that gramophone with you. May I ask why? Because it's out of place in a civilized home. We'll take up the matter after lunch. I know. I don't think I've ever seen a nicer setting. Yes, it was. Isn't it lovely? Pelting down out there. What, dear? It's raining. What are you reading? Len Rogers' memoirs. -Who was Len Rogers? -He was a trades union leader. Was he a radical? Yes, I'd say so. Does John know of your political beliefs? -And he still wants to marry you? -Seems to. I've asked John to come early for lunch. -What? -He's coming early for lunch. You won't forbid the match, will you? lf you do, I shall elope. Never fear... ...l'm too delighted at the prospect of getting you off our hands at last. Does Desmond know, by the way? I'm not sure I like that "at last." Have you told Desmond yet? Do you love him? John? Yes, I do. Do you? You don't behave as if you're in love. How does one behave as if one is in love? One doesn't read The Social Evil and the Social Good. One reads Lord Byron. Is that so? I see. I don't think you modern girls have the feelings our generation did. Very well. I love John in every way a woman can love a man. Does that satisfy you? My, look at the rain. I thought I saw someone in the garden. Where? Over there. Do you see? Whoever it is is getting terribly wet. -Is that John? -Sounded like it. Quick, into the drawing room. All right. Good. Here we go. You forgot your bag. What on earth's going on? We'll leave you with John. When finished, cough or something. What do you mean, "or something"? Knock three times with your stick, and then we'll come in. You don't think it'll look a trifle coincidental? Mr. Watherstone. -How are you? -Hello, sir. Have you got a coin? Here. Thank Mr. Simms for delivering on a Sunday, will you? Glad you could come. I see you have your tree. Fellow just put it up for us. -How are you, sir? -Oh, fine. This arthritis is troubling me a bit. Catherine told me it was better. Yes. It was better. Now it's worse. I understand you wish to marry my daughter. Yes, sir. That is, I proposed to her and she's accepted me. I see. I trust that your second statement wasn't a denial of your first. -You do really wish to marry her? -Yes, of course, sir. Why "of course"? There are plenty who don't wish to marry her. "Of course," because I proposed. That too doesn't necessarily follow. However, we don't need to quibble. We'll take the sentimental side for granted. As to the practical side, I hope you won't mind some personal questions. No, sir. It's your duty. Quite so. Your income. Are you able to live on it? No, I'm in the regular army. But my pay is supplemented by an allowance. So I understand. -Your pay would be about L24 a month? -That's right. Your total income with your subaltern's pay... ...plus the allowance from your father would be about L420 a year? Again, exactly the figure. It seems perfectly satisfactory. I needn't delay my congratulations. Thank you, sir. -Do you smoke? -I do. I propose to settle on my daughter one-sixth of my total capital. Which, to the final fraction, is L833, six shillings and eight pence. But let's deal in round figures, shall we, and call it L850. I call that very generous, sir. It's not as generous as I'd have liked, but if it seems agreeable... ...l don't think we have any more to discuss. -No, sir. -Splendid. Pretty rotten weather, isn't it, sir? Yes, vile. Cigarette? No, thank you, sir. I'm still smoking. Well? Well, what? How was your little chat? You weren't supposed to know we were having a chat. You're infuriating. Is everything all right, John? -I'm glad. I really am. -Thank you, Mrs. Winslow. -Can I kiss you? -Yes. Well, I'm practically your mother now. I'm practically your father, but if you'll forgive me.... He's gone and left the garden gate open. Could someone close the garden gate for us? I don't suppose you'd mind if we left you alone? I think we might allow ourselves a modest celebration at lunch. Would you get me the cellar key? Violet, would you have someone see to the gate, please? Was it an ordeal? -Scared to death. -My poor darling. I had a lot of neatly turned phrases, but he wouldn't let me use them. -I'm sure they were good. -I thought they were. Want to do your speech for me? Love to. What is it? Ronnie, what is it? Where did Father go? ls he gone? I'll go and get him. No, don't go and get him. No! Cate, please don't. -Please, Cate, don't. -What's the trouble, Ronnie? You'd better go and change, hadn't you? What's the trouble? You can tell me. You know John Watherstone. You met him last holidays. I'll disappear. Now, darling, what is it? You can tell me. Have you run away? What is it then? Oh, God! I didn't do it. Really, I didn't. No, darling. This letter's addressed to Father. Did you open it? You shouldn't have. I was going to tear it up. We could tell Father term had ended two days sooner. -I'm back for Christmas holidays-- -No, darling. I didn't do it. Really, I didn't. Ronnie, old lad, how's everything? Back early? -Take him upstairs. I'll get Mother. -All right. What's up then, old chap? Nothing. Have you been sacked? Bad luck. What for? -I didn't do it. -Of course not. I know. -Honestly. I didn't. -That's all right. I believe you. No need to go on. I say, you're a bit damp. -I've been in the rain. -You're shivering too. Ought you to change? Don't want you catching pneumonia. I'm all right. -Mother. -There, darling. There, there. All right now. -I didn't do it, Mother. -No, darling, of course you didn't. Let's get out of these wet things. -Don't tell Father. -No, darling. Not yet. I promise. A new uniform too. What a shame. All right, Ronnie. It's all right. Bad news? -Expelled? -That's right. What's he done? He's supposed to have.... Just think what he's been going through these last 1 0 days. It seems pretty heartless, I admit. You must remember, darling... ...he's not really at school. He is in the services. What's the difference? Their ways may seem brutal, but they are always fair. Must have been a full inquiry before taking this step. If there's been a 1 0-day delay... ...it was to give the boy a better chance to clear himself. I'm awfully sorry. How will your father take it? It might kill him. We've got Desmond to lunch. I forgot. Desmond Curry, our family solicitor. Oh, Lord! Darling, be polite to him, won't you? Am I usually rude? -He doesn't know about us. -Who does? But he's been in love with me for years. It's a family joke. Desmond, I don't think you know John Watherstone. I've heard a lot about him. -How do you do? -Well, well, well. I trust I'm not early? No. Punctual as always. Capital. Good. No, I'm sorry. Please. I was wondering how your shoulder was. Not very well. The damp, you know. -Sorry to hear that. -Old cricket injury. Well, it seems I'm to congratulate you both. Violet told me at the door. Yes, I must congratulate you both. -Thank you. -Thank you so much. Of course, it's quite expected, I know. Still it was rather a surprise, hearing it from Violet that way. We were going to tell you. It was official this morning. -You're the first to hear it. -Am l? Am I indeed? I see you've got your tree. -Hello, Mrs. Winslow. -Hello, Desmond, dear. I've got him to bed. Nobody ill, I hope? Hello, Desmond. You're not looking well. The old cricket thing. Any relation of D.W.H. Curry? Played for Middlesex. I am D.W.H. Curry. -Curry of Curry's match? -Yes. Hat trick against the Players in what year? 1 895 at Lord's. -You were a hero of mine. -Was l? Was I indeed? I used to have a signed photograph of you. I used to sign a lot once, for schoolboys. I think we might try a little of the Madeira before luncheon. We're celebrating-- It's all right. Desmond knows. Yes, indeed. It's wonderful news, isn't it? I'll gladly drink a toast to the.... " Happy pair," I think is the phrase that's eluding you. As a matter of fact, I was looking for something new to say. A forlorn quest, my dear Desmond. A forlorn quest. Arthur, you mustn't be so rude. I meant, naturally, that nobody... ...with the possible exception of Voltaire... ...could find anything new to say about an engaged couple. Dickie! A toast to the happy pair. Is that all finally spliced up? Cate definitely being entered for the marriage stakes? Good egg! Quite so. I should've added, "with the exception of Voltaire and Dickie Winslow." Are we allowed to drink to our own healths? -It's permissible. -It's bad luck. -We defy augury, don't we? -You mustn't say that. I know. You can drink each other's healths. So... ...our superstitious terrors are allayed, are they? Good. Catherine... ...and John. Violet! We mustn't leave you out. -You must join us. -Nothing for me, sir. You'd be more convincing if you hadn't brought an extra glass. Not for myself, sir. It's for Master Ronnie. You brought a glass for Ronnie? I thought you'd allow him a taste. To drink the toast. He's so grown-up. But Master Ronnie doesn't get back from Osbourne until Tuesday. He's back. The girl said. The holidays don't start till Tuesday. The girl saw him. Isn't that right, ma'am? Grace, what does this mean? All right, Violet, you can go. Yes, miss. Catherine, did you know Ronnie was back? -Dickie? -Yes, Father. Grace? We thought you shouldn't know, Arthur. Just for the time being. Is the boy very ill? Answer me, someone. Is the boy very ill? No, Father, he's not ill. Will someone tell me what has happened, please? He brought this letter for you, Arthur. Will you read it to me, please? Not in front of-- Will you read it to me, please? "Sir, I am commanded by my Lords' Commissioners of the Admiralty... ...to inform you of a communication from the Commanding Officer... ...of the Royal Naval College... ...reporting the theft of a 5-shilling postal order at the college... ...which was cashed at the Post Office. Investigation of the case leaves no other conclusion possible... ...than that the order was cashed by your son, Cadet Ronald Arthur Winslow. My Lords regret that they must request you... ...to withdraw your son from the college. I am, sir, your obedient servant." It's signed by.... I can't read his name. Would you be kind enough to have Ronnie come down and see me, please? -He's in bed. -You told me he wasn't ill. He's not at all well. Thank you, Desmond. The rest of you go into luncheon. Take them in, please. Arthur, don't you think--? Would you decant the claret? You'll find it in the dining room. -Yes, Father. -Thank you. Please don't.... Please don't.... What mustn't I do? Please don't forget he's only a child. Come on, Mother. Come on, darling. It's all right. Come in! Come in and close the door. Come over here. Why aren't you in uniform? It got wet. How did it get wet? -I was out in the garden in the rain. -Why? I was hiding. From me? Remember you promised me... ...if you got into trouble you'd come to me first? Why didn't you come to me? Why did you hide in the garden? -I don't know, Father. -Are you so frightened of me? It says in this letter that you stole a postal order. I don't want you to speak until you've heard what I have to say first. If you did it, you must tell me. I shan't be angry with you, Ronnie, provided you tell me the truth. But if you lie, I shall know it. Because a lie between you and me cannot be hidden. I shall know it, Ronnie. So remember that before you speak. Did you steal this postal order? No, Father, I didn't. Did you steal this postal order? No, Father, I didn't. Go on back to bed. "The efforts of Mr. Arthur Winslow to secure a fair trial for his son... ...having been thwarted at every turn by a soulless oligarchy.... " "Soulless oligarchy." That's rather good. " It is high time private and peaceful citizens of this country woke to... ...the increasing encroachment of their freedoms." Tell me a piece of news. I tell you news. A chap on the train had on brown boots. Brown boots, I ask you! -Did he wear a brown suit? -No excuse. -Can you get this out? -I'm going to the law library. Polly, do you think you can get this out? -Fighting on many fronts? -That's right. Cannon to the right of you and so on? Paying you yet? I just do it for the sport of the thing. The other's from " Perplexed." "With the troubles in the Balkans and the inquiry... ...at which the judge confirmed the findings that the boy was guilty... ...this correspondence now must cease." In any case, it'll blow over before the wedding. -Postponed again? -His father's out of town. Nothing wrong? I won't have to quirt him with my riding crop? "This correspondence now must cease." Well, I'm late for a meeting with the guv. What would one of your bookmaker friends lay in the way of odds... ...of your getting a degree? Well, let's think. Say about evens? I doubt whether your friend would find many takers. Well, perhaps 7-to-4 against. And the odds against your becoming a civil servant? -A bit steeper. -Exactly. Quite a bit steeper. You don't want a bet, do you? No, Dickie, I'm not a gambler. And that is exactly the trouble. Unhappily, I'm no longer in a position to gamble L200 a year... ...on what you admit is an outside chance. It's the case, I suppose. You want me to leave Oxford? I'm afraid so. -Straightaway? -No, finish your year. And then what? I can get you a job at the bank. Oh, Lord. It'd be quite a good job. My influence here still counts for something. Father, if I promised you, really promised you.... I'm afraid my mind is made up. Oh, Lord. -This is a shock for you. -What? No. It isn't, really. I've been rather expecting it, as a matter of fact. Things are tight. Yes, they're tight. And you're still hoping to brief Sir Robert Morton? Yes, we're hoping. -That'd take a bit of tin. -Yes, it will. Still, I can't say but that it isn't a bit of a slap in the face. I thank you for bearing what must be an unpleasant blow with some fortitude. Nonsense, Father. Miss Barnes from The Beacon to see Arthur Winslow. I have an appointment. -What a lovely home you have. -It's showing its age a bit, but.... My paper usually sends me out on stories that are of interest to women. Stories with a little heart, you know, like this one. A father's fight for his boy's honour. I think the case has rather wider implications than that. Yes, of course. What I'd like is to get a nice picture of you and your boy. My son's arriving from school soon. His mother's gone to meet him. From school? How interesting. So you got a school to take him? They didn't mind the unpleasantness? Not at all, not at all. No question of that. I found it extraordinary how fair-minded people are. Yes, indeed. And why is he coming back this time? He's not being expelled again, if that was your implication. -He's doing quite well at school. -Good. Extraordinarily well, considering the circumstances. Why is he coming back? He's coming to London to be examined by Sir Robert Morton. Robert Morton? Do you think he'll take a little case like this? -This is not a little case, madam. -Of course not. Of course not. It's not a little case. Nothing of the sort. Now, perhaps you wouldn't mind giving me a few details. When did it all start? Four months ago. I knew of the charge when my son arrived with a letter... ...informing me of his expulsion. I phoned Osbourne to protest... ...and I was referred by them to the Lords of the Admiralty. My solicitors then took the matter up. We applied for a court-martial. They ignored us. We applied for a civil trial, they ignored us again. And after tremendous pressure, letters to the papers... ...questions in the House and by other means... ...to private citizens... ...the Admiralty eventually agreed to an independent inquiry. -Good. -It was not good, madam. At that independent inquiry, conducted by the judge advocate of the fleet... ...against whom I'm saying nothing, my son, a child of 1 4... ...was not represented by counsel, solicitors or friends. What happened at that inquiry? What do you think? lnevitably, he was found guilty again... ...and branded a second time before the world as a thief and a forger. What a shame. I need hardly tell you, I will not let the matter rest there. I intend to fight this monstrous injustice with every weapon... ...and every power at my disposal. And I have a plan. I've approached Sir Robert-- I have petitioned Sir Robert Morton-- What charming curtains. What are they made of? Madam, I fear I have no idea. -Is that the poor little chap? -Hello, Ronnie! I say, Mr. Moore says I needn't come back until Monday. So that gives me three whole days. How are you, my boy? I'm tops, Father. Mother says I've grown an inch. That's the lad! That's the lad. That's the lad we need a picture of. You want to take it outside? I only mention it as the light's going. Might we go to the park? I was thinking we'd go to the park. Do you think? You could wear your uniform. I don't think that would be a good idea. Something to stress his youth. Do you have cricket clothes? This lady's from The Beacon. She's interested in your curtains. Really? How nice. Indeed. I was wondering what they were made of. -Which? -In the drawing room. They're an entirely new material. I'm afraid I don't know what it's called. I got it in Barker's last year. It's a mixture of silk and velvet. -We're losing the light. -If we could, do you see... ...put him in cricket costume? It would say both "youth" and " England." -Oh, very well. -I'll set up. Yes, you set up. Goodbye. Very best of good fortune in your inspiring fight. It was very good of you to talk to me. -I've found the name of the material. -Excellent. Excellent. Marvellous. -That's very kind of you. -Not at all. Ronnie, we'll meet you in the park. What's she talking about? -The case, I imagine. -Oh, the case. Father, did you know the train had 1 4 coaches? Had it really? -Yes, all corridor. -Remarkable. I've had your half-term report, Ronnie. -On the whole, it was pretty fair. -Good. I'm glad you seem to be settling down so well. Yes, thank you, Father. Do you know how long the train took? 1 23 miles in 2 hours and 52 minutes. That's an average of 46.73 miles an hour. I worked it out. You worked it out well. You better change for the photographer. -Violet's out. -Tell her I'm back? Yes. Now you need to go and change. I found a new citation in the law library. -Ronnie's back. -What? I said, Ronnie's back. New frock? Bless you, I've turned the cuffs. -Turned the cuffs? -What? No, I said I like the frock. -Like it? -Yes, I do. I hope John likes it. What are you reading? Admiralty law. New citation: " Cadet's right to a first hearing." Did John telephone? Things are all right between you? -Of course, everything's perfect. -Good, good. Couldn't be better. Good. Are we both mad, you and l? Tell me. Should we drop the whole thing? I don't consider that a serious question. You realize your marriage settlement will have to go? Of course. I gave that up for lost weeks ago. It won't make any difference? Good heavens, no. All right. Let us pin our faith on the appearance of a champion. You know what I think of Robert Morton. Don't let's go into that again. I want the best. The best in this case is not Morton. -Why does everyone say he is? -Why does everyone vote for slavery? He's the best if one happens to be a large monopoly attacking a trade union. Then he's your lad. Yes, indeed he is. -Did Mr. Watherstone telephone? -I just stepped out. To the best of my knowledge, no one's phoned. If his heart isn't in it, he won't accept the brief. He might. It depends what's in it for him. Luckily, there isn't much. There's a substantial check. He doesn't want money. He must be very rich. -What does he want? -To advance his interests. You're prejudiced because he spoke against women's suffrage. Is that a prejudice or a position? You tell me. It's a position. He's always speaking against what is right. Mr. Curry, miss. Mr. Curry. Hello, Desmond. Yes. What? Wait. What? Violet, did we receive a letter from Mr. Curry? Yes, I just-- Now? Yes, right. Thank you. Yes. What is it, my dear? Violet, hail us a cab. -Where's Ronnie? -In the park. We'll go without him. Desmond got us an appointment with Sir Robert. When? Half an hour ago. -We only have a few moments. -We didn't get your note. He has a most important dinner engagement, sir. Where's the boy? He'll be along with my wife soon. -He can only spare us very few moments. -We're conscious of it. You'd better go on ahead. Explain why we're late. Make our apologies. Go now. It's straight through that doorway, up the stairs and to your left. Miss Catherine Winslow. The Winslow case. -We understood that-- -They're coming. They're coming? We didn't hear of the appointment until-- Miss Catherine Winslow. I beg your pardon. I suppose you know the history of this case, Sir Robert? I believe I've seen most of the relevant documents. Yes, excellent. Do you think we can bring the case into court by a collusive action? I really have no idea. Curry and Curry seem to think that might hold. Do they? They are a very reliable firm. Robert Morton. Catherine Winslow. Mr. Michaels, if I could have your attention. Yes, sir. You don't mind if l...? What's more absurd than your asking permission to smoke in your office? -It's just the custom. -I indulge, myself. Indeed? Some find that shocking. Amazing how little it takes to offend the world. No, thank you. My father and brother will be here. What time are you dining? Eight o'clock. Far from here? Devonshire House. Then you mustn't be late. I'm rather surprised that a case of this sort should interest you. Are you? It seems such a trivial affair compared to your great forensic triumphs. I was in court when you prosecuted the Trades Union Embezzlement case. Really? Magnificently done. Thank you. You heard that he committed suicide a few months ago? Yes, I had heard. Many people believed him innocent, you know. So I understand. As it happens, however, he was guilty. Sir Robert, I am so sorry to keep you waiting. I'm so sorry. We didn't get your note-- -Perfectly all right. -Sir Robert is due at Devonshire House. I know that you're pressed for time, sir. My son will be along at any moment. I assume you'll want to examine him. Just a few questions. That is all I will have time for. I'm sorry to hear it. My son journeyed from school hoping to be interviewed. And I hoped, by the end of it... ...l should know definitely whether you'd accept the brief. You, of course, understand my anxiety? Perhaps Sir Robert would consent to finish his examination some other time. It might be arranged. Tomorrow? Tomorrow is impossible. I'm in court and in the House of Commons all day. I see. Curry says it's possible to proceed by Petition of Right. -Would you mind if I sat down, sir? -Please. What's a Petition of Right? The assumption that the Admiralty, as the Crown, can do no wrong-- That was the assumption we refused to grant. In law, I mean. A subject can sue the Crown, nevertheless, by Petition of Right. Petition of Right, yes. Redress being granted as a matter of grace. And the custom is for the attorney general, on behalf of the Crown... ...to endorse the petition, allowing the case to come to court. It is interesting to note the exact words he uses on such occasions are: " Let right be done." " Let right be done." I like that phrase, sir. It has a certain ring about it, has it not? " Let right be done." This is Sir Robert. That's my wife. This is Ronnie. Sir Robert will ask you a few questions, answer truthfully as always. -I expect you'd like us to leave. -No. Provided, of course, you don't interrupt. Would you sit down, please? Sorry we're late. That's all right. Nothing's happened at all. Will you stand here facing me? That's right. Now, Ronald, how old are you? Fourteen and two months. You were then 1 3 and 1 0 months old when you left Osbourne? -Is that right? -Yes, sir. I would like to cast your mind back to December 7th of last year. Tell me in your own words exactly what happened to you on that day. It was half-holiday, so we didn't have any work after dinner. -Dinner at 1 :00? -Yes, at least until prep at 7:00. Prep at 7:00. Just before dinner, I went to the chief petty officer... ...and asked him for 1 5 and 6 out of what I had in the school bank. Why? -I wanted to buy an air pistol. -Which cost 1 5 and 6? Yes, sir. How much did you have in the school bank? -Two pounds, three shillings. -What incentive could he--? I must ask you to be good enough not to interrupt me, sir. After you had withdrawn the 1 5 and 6, what did you do? I had dinner. Then what? I went to the locker room and put my money in my locker. Then I went to get permission to go to the post office. Then I went back to the locker room... ...got my money and went down to the post office. Yes, go on. -I bought my postal order. -For 1 5 and 6? Yes, sir. Then I went back to college. Then I met Elliot minor. He said, " lsn't it rot? Someone broke into my locker... ...and pinched a postal order. I've reported it." And those were Elliot minor's exact words? He might have used another word for " rot." I see. Continue. Just before prep, I was told to go see Commander Flower. The post office woman was there. The commander said, " ls this the boy?" She said, " It might be. I can't be sure, they all look alike." She couldn't identify him. Go on. She said, " I know that the boy who bought a postal order for 1 5 and 6... ...was the one who cashed one for 5 shillings." So the commander said, " Did you buy a postal order for 1 5 and 6?" And I said, "Yes." He made me write Elliot's name... ...and compared it to the signature on the postal order. Then 1 0 days later I was sacked. I mean, expelled. I see. Did you cash Elliot minor's postal order for 5 shillings? No, sir. Did you steal it from his locker? No, sir. That is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Yes, sir. Right. The files, please. This has just come down from Ridgeley Pierce. Thank you. When the commander asked you to write Elliot's name... ...did you write the Christian name or initials? I wrote " Charles K. Elliot." Did you see the forged postal order in the commander's office? Yes, sir. The commander showed it to me. Before or after you wrote Elliot's name? After. Did you see how Elliot's name was written on it? -Yes, sir. The same. -The same. -Charles K. Elliot. -Yes. When you wrote, what made you choose that particular form? -That was the way he signed his name. -How did you know? He was a great friend. How did you know? -I saw him sign things. -What things? Ordinary things. I repeat. What things? Bits of paper. Bits of paper? Why did he sign bits of paper? -He was practising his signature. -And you saw him? He knew you saw him? Well, yes. He showed you exactly how he wrote his signature? Yes, I suppose he did. Did you practise writing it yourself? I might have. What do you mean? Did you or not? You never told me that. -It was only a joke. -Even if it was a joke... ...you practised forging Elliot's signature. It wasn't forging. -What is it then? -Writing. Whoever stole and cashed the postal order also wrote Elliot's signature. Oddly enough, in the exact form in which you had practised his signature. Which side are you on? Are you aware... ...the Admiralty sent the forged postal order to Mr. Ridgeley Pierce? The greatest handwriting expert in England? -Yes. -You're aware of that? Mr. Ridgeley Pierce affirmed there was no doubt... ...the signature on the postal order and the one you wrote... ...were by one and the same hand? You say you didn't forge that signature? Yes, I do. Mr. Ridgeley Pierce doesn't know his job? Well, he's wrong, anyway. Is he indeed? Are you aware the government has 1 7 examples of your handwriting? And a board of experts identified them as identical... ...with the signature of Charles K. Elliot? When you went into the locker room, were you alone? I don't remember. I think you do. Were you alone? You knew Elliot's locker? Yes, of course. -Why did you go in there? -To put my money away. -Why? -I thought it safer. Why safer than your pocket? I don't know. What time did Elliot put his postal order in his locker? I didn't know he had a postal order. When did you go to the locker room? I don't remember. -Directly after dinner? -I think so. What did you do afterwards? I went to get permission to go to the post office. -At what time? -A quarter past 2. Dinner was over. You were in the locker room for 1 l2 an hour. I wasn't in there all that time. -How long were you there? -About five minutes. -And for the other 25? -I don't remember. -Perhaps I was at the C.O.'s office. -No one saw you there either? I remember someone did see me there. A chap called Casey. I spoke to him. What did you say? " Come to the post office with me to cash a postal order." " Cash" a postal order? I mean, get. You said, "cash." Why say "cash" if you meant "get"? I don't know. I suggest "cash" was the truth. You're muddling me. You're easily muddled. How many lies have you told? None. Really, I haven't. I suggest your testimony's a lie. No, it's the truth! I suggest there is barely any truth in what you said... ...to me, the judge or the commander. I suggest you broke into Elliot's locker and stole the postal order. -You cashed it by forging his name. -I didn't! You did it as a joke, meaning to give the money back. But when he reported it, you decided to keep quiet. It isn't true! It isn't true! None of it's true! By denying your guilt, you're causing hardship to your family... ...and annoyance to important persons in this country. That's a disgraceful thing to say. The time has come for you to undo the misery you've caused... ...by confessing to us all that you're a forger, a liar and a thief! I'm not, I'm not! I didn't do it! This is outrageous, sir. -I didn't do any of it. -It's all right, now. Curry, can I drop you anywhere? No, l.... Send all his files by tomorrow morning. Will you need them now? Yes. The boy is plainly innocent. I accept the brief. Get this to the First Lord, will you? The chief point of criticism against the Admiralty... ...appears to centre in the purely legal question... ...of the Petition of Right brought by a member. A citizen seeking redress of the Petition of Right... -...and the demurrer thereto. -Nonsense! This member has made great play of this boy... ...with his eloquence and address. And I was moved, as any honourable member opposite... ...by his resonant use of the words, " Let right be done." The time-honoured phrase with which, in his opinion... ...the attorney general should have supported... ...Mr. Winslow's Petition of Right. All right. Let's break it down into its essentials. Do we have enough votes to put the question? How important is it, Bobby? How important is it? It's only important to win. Shouldn't you be in the House? Looks like he's repeating himself forever. Give me a piece of paper. Am I missing something here? -The thing is, the votes. -Well, yes, well. Do you say we have the votes? Say? Do we have votes? Do we have the money? The answer's perhaps. Do you really want to spend it on this? Let me just have a quick look, miss. Can you get a vote? -Can you, Tony? -Perhaps I can. End of the day, it's a 1 2-year-old boy. -You sure you want to fight it? -Of course. Before we start calling in markers. Dick's saying to choose your ground. There's no retreat. Pick this up, you'll have to carry it. It's your best interest, Bobby. I understand. Excuse me. -What did I miss? -You didn't miss anything. What's going on? He says all the great crimes... ...are committed in the name of public tranquillity. Close the book now. Is everything all right? Everything's fine. Go to sleep now. -Good night, Mother. -Good night. Good night, Ronnie. Sleep well. Good night. I fancy this a good opportunity of talking to Violet. I'll do it. Tomorrow, perhaps-- You'd do better to grasp the nettle. Delay adds to your worries. What do you know about my worries? A good deal. But they'd lessen if you faced the situation squarely. It won't be easy finding another place. The facts are that we have half the income we had a year ago... ...and we're living at nearly the same rate. Whichever way you look at it, it's bad economics. I'm not talking about economics. I'm talking about our life. Things we took for granted don't seem to matter now. Such as? Such as a happy home and anonymity and an ordinary, respectable life. There's your return for it. I pray you know what you're doing. -I know exactly what I am doing. -Do you? He's perfectly happy. He's at a good school. He's doing very well. No one would know about Osbourne if you hadn't shouted it to the world. Now he'll be known as "the boy who stole that postal order." He didn't steal it, Grace. You talk about sacrificing everything for him. When he's grown up, he won't thank you for it. Even though you've given your life to " publish his innocence," as you say. Yes, Arthur, your life. You talk gaily about arthritis and a touch of gout. You know better than the doctors what ails you. You're destroying yourself and me and your family besides. For what, I'd like to know? For what? For justice, Grace. Are you sure that's true? Are you sure it isn't pride and self-importance? No, I don't think so. I really don't think so. I'm not going to cry, say I'm sorry and make things up again. I can stand it all for a reason. But for no reason at all, it's unfair to ask so much of me. It's unfair! What's the matter, Father? Mother's a little upset, that's all. Why? Aren't things going very well? Everything's going very well. You go on back to bed. Good night. Thank you very much. Here you are. Off you go. Thank you, Violet. -How long have you been with us? -Twenty-four years come April, sir. Is it as long as that? Cate was that high when I come in. Dickie hadn't even been thought of. What do you think of this case, Violet? Fine old rumpus, sir, and no mistake. It is indeed, a fine old rumpus. It was in the Evening News. Did you read it? What did it say? How it was a fuss about nothing. Waste of the government's time. How it was good because it could only happen in England. Seems a strange lack of logic in that argument. Perhaps it was a bit different. Still, that's what it said. When you think it's all because of our Ronnie, I have to laugh. Really, I do. Wasting the government's time at his age. I never did. Wonders will never cease. No, wonders will never cease. Will that be all? Yes, that'll be all. Good evening, Violet. Hello, Father! How are you? Slinking down alleyways. Are they still camping out in the street? Oh, yes. How'd you get on this evening? -Are those for me? -Yes. -Is the debate over? -As good as. The First Lord assured that in the future... ...there would be no inquiry at Osbourne without informing the parents. That satisfied most members. What about our case? Will he allow us a fair trial? Apparently not. I thought he'd be forced to. I thought so too. The House evidently thought otherwise. So we're back to where we started. -I'm sorry, Father? -I said, we're back where we started. Is that it, you mean? Yes, it looks like it. But didn't Sir Robert protest when the First Lord refused a trial? Something far more spectacular. He had his feet on the table and his hat over his eyes... ...during most of the First Lord's speech. He suddenly got up, glared at the First Lord... ...threw notes on the floor and stalked out of the House. -Magnificent effect. -Or perhaps a display of feeling? Sir Robert is not a man of feeling. I doubt any emotion at all can stir in that dead heart. He took the brief. What have we done for him? First-rate publicity. "The staunch defender of the little man." Lucky for him. -And lucky for us too. -Don't fool yourself. He is an avaricious, a conniving, an unfeeling man. We've bought his services, for the moment. We've bought him like a cheap threepenny whore-- -Good evening. -Good evening. Something gone down the wrong way? -May I assist? -Most kind. Good evening, sir. I thought I'd give an account of the day... ...but perhaps she has forestalled me. Forgive me for a moment. I wonder if you'd entertain Sir Robert in my absence? Did you know I was in the gallery? How could I have missed you with such a charming brown hat? Thank you. Will you betray a technical secret? What happened in the first examination to make you so sure of his innocence? Three things. First of all, he made far too many damaging admissions. A guilty person would've been more careful and on his guard. Secondly, I laid him a trap, and thirdly, left him a loophole. A guilty one would've fallen into one and darted through the other. He did neither. The trap was to ask what time Elliot put the postal order in his locker. Yes. And the loophole? I then suggested to him that he'd stolen the postal order for a joke... ...which, had he been guilty... ...l'm sure he would've admitted to as being the lesser of two evils. It was very cleverly thought out. -Thank you. -And what of the 25 minutes? 25 minutes? Ronnie went back to the locker room, and there were 25 minutes... ...he could not account for. What was he doing? But I thought you should know. Why me? -It's a crime you indulge in. -What can you mean? He was smoking a cigarette. May we offer you some refreshment? Whiskey and soda? A whiskey. My daughter told me of your demonstration during the speech. She described it as magnificent. That was good of her. It's an old trick. I've done it many times. It's nearly always surprisingly effective. Was the First Lord at all put out by it? Did you notice? How could he not be? I wish you'd seen it. I forgot to give you this letter. Thank you, Violet. When did this come? -A few minutes ago, miss. -Thank you. You know the writing? I shouldn't read it if I were you. Would you forgive me, Sir Robert? Of course. What do you think the next step should be? -In the abstract or the particular? -The particular. The best plan would be to renew our efforts... ...to force the Director of Public Prosecutions to act. -Wouldn't that be rather unorthodox? -I certainly hope so. Do we have a chance of success? Of course, or I would not suggest it. Father, Sir Robert thinks we might get... ...the Director of Public Prosecutions to act. What? What'd you say? We were discussing how to proceed with the case. I'm afraid I don't think, all things considered... ...that much purpose would be served by going on. I don't think any purpose would be served by going on. That's absurd. Of course we must go on. How could you say otherwise? I've made sacrifices for this case. Some of them I had no right to make... ...but I made them nonetheless. But there is a limit. And I've reached it. I'm sorry, Sir Robert. The Winslow case is now closed. -I should explain this letter. -There is no need. This is from Colonel Watherstone, the father of the man I'm engaged to. He writes that our efforts to discredit the Admiralty... ...have resulted in our making the name of Winslow a laughingstock. -I don't care for his English. -It's not very good, is it? He says that unless my father will give him a firm undertaking... ...to drop this whining and reckless agitation-- I suppose he means the case. --he will exert every influence he has over his son... ...to prevent him marrying me. I see. -May I take a cigarette? -Yes, of course. It's a vile habit, isn't it? Which of us is perfect? That really was a most charming hat, Miss Winslow. I'm glad you liked it. It seems decidedly wrong to me that a lady of your political persuasion... ...should be allowed to adorn herself with such a very feminine allurement. It looks like trying to have the best of both worlds. Does it indeed? It does. And is that a particularly female trait? I'm not a militant. I don't go about shattering glass or pouring acid down pillar boxes. I'm very glad to hear it. Both those activities would be unsuitable in that hat. I have never yet fully grasped... ...what active steps you take to propagate your cause. I'm an organizing secretary at the Woman's Suffrage Association. Indeed! Is the work hard? Very. But not, I should imagine, lucrative. The work is voluntary and unpaid. Dear me. What sacrifices you ladies seem prepared to make for your convictions. Forgive me, sir, if I spoke out of turn just now. That's quite all right. Of course, you must act as you think fit. But I suggest you delay your decision until you've thought a while. I'll answer you presently. Well... ...my father wrote your father a letter. -You read it? -Yes, did you? He showed it to me. Yes. -What's his answer? -My father? -He won't send one. -He'll ignore it? Isn't that the best response to blackmail? -It was highhanded of the old man. -Highhanded? -The trouble is he's serious. -I never thought he wasn't. He's as serious as can be. If your father carries on, he'll do everything he threatened. He'll forbid the match? -That's right. -An empty threat, isn't it? There's always the allowance. Yes. There's always the allowance. Without the settlement, I can't live on my pay. And with two of us-- -Two can live as cheaply as one. -Don't you believe it. Yes, I see. You're off to the House of Commons again? Yes, it's hard on you, John, isn't it? A fellow thought I'd like to see this. He cut it out to show me. Here's poor old John Bull. He can't get his work done because of the Winslow situation. What do you think about that? Do you want to marry me? Yes, I do. But isn't it too late? If we drop the case, would you still want to marry the "Winslow girl"? -That'll blow over. -And we'd still have the allowance. It is important. You can't shame me into saying it isn't. -I didn't mean to shame you. -But you did. I'm sorry. The case is lost. The case is lost. Give it up. What's your answer? I love you. The answer is I want to be your wife. Then you'll drop the case? Yes, I will. I must tell Sir Robert. --the right honourable and learned gentleman opposite... --the right honourable and learned gentleman opposite... ...to calumniate the Admiralty... ...for a child, gentlemen. For a child. A guilty child. Oh, can we not, I do beseech you, make an end? One cannot sue the Crown. Justice has been done, to the tenth decimal point. And it is time to lay aside nursery gossip... ...and to proceed with the business of government. You're all in, Bobby. I say, you're all in. Go home. We're finished. You've fought the good fight. You've fought the good fight, but we ain't got the votes. It's over. -We did what we could. -Thanks for your support. Don't break your heart. Everybody loses one. There's no shame. -Listen to Tony. -You can't hold back the tide. You couldn't have fought harder. The House is against you. Let's let it go. And I believe I can state with certainty... ...that the mood of this House is sure, correct... ...and supportive of the Admiralty. I thank you for your patience. -I thank you for your time. -What's this? -Mr. Speaker, put the question. -They're calling the question. Let them call the question. We're done. There's no shame in it. The motion is.... Point of order, Mr. Speaker. Point of order. I am on my feet. -Does this escape you? -Point of order. -I am on my feet. -Gentlemen! -There is a motion-- -Point of order. I must insist! Upon what grounds? Sit down and I'll tell you. -Sit down! -Very well, make your old speech. Thank you. I have a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I should like to read into the record two items. First item, popular song of the day: " How Still We See Thee Lie" or "The Naughty Cadet." " How dare you sully Nelson's name, who for this land did die? Oh, naughty cadet, for shame, for shame. How still we see thee lie." They suggest our concern for the boy... ...might perhaps tarnish the reputation of Lord Nelson. -You said two items. -The other one is this. It's from a slightly older source. It is this: "You shall not side with the great against the powerless." Point of order. I'm on my feet. Will you yield? I will not yield! "You shall not side with the great against the powerless." Have you heard those words, gentlemen? Do you recognize their source? From that same source I add this injunction. It is this: "What you do to the least of them... ...you do to me." Now. Now, gentlemen.... -Good afternoon, miss. -Hello. I'll be damned if that's not the-- Will you get on the camera? What happened? What happened? First Lord thought he was safe, home free. Sir Robert spoke. Now he's under attack. -From whom? -From everybody. When he comes out, here's what I want. Excuse me, sir. What happened? It seems, miss... ...that rather than risk a division... ...the First Lord is endorsing the Petition of Right. It means the case of Winslow v. Rex can therefore come to court. Well, Miss Winslow, what are my instructions? Do you need my instructions? Aren't they already on the petition? Doesn't it say, " Let right be done"? Then we must endeavour to see that it is. I've got The Beacon. I've got the news! Read the latest about the Winslow boy right here in these pages! Read it here! -Here it is. Thank you. -Thank you. Latest on the Winslow boy! You're thinner. I like your new suit. Off the peg at three-and-a-half guineas. Does that go on all the time outside? -We're waiting for the verdict. -Where's Cate? Cate takes the morning session. I go in the afternoon. How's it all going? I don't know. I've been there all four days now and hardly understood a word. Will there be room for me? Oh, yes. They reserve places for the family. How'd Ronnie get on in the witness box? Two days he was cross-examined. Two whole days. Imagine! Poor little pet. He didn't seem to mind. He said two days with the attorney general... ...wasn't as bad as two minutes with Sir Robert. Cate said he made a good impression. How is Cate? All right. You heard about John, I suppose. That's what I meant. How has she taken it? You can never tell. She never lets you know what she's feeling. We all think he behaved very badly. Your father's on the terrace. How are you, Dickie? Very well, thank you, Father. Mr. Lamb tells me you've joined the Territorials. I'm sorry, what? Mr. Lamb tells me that you've enlisted in the Territorials. Why have you done that? There's a chance of a scrap soon. If there is, I want to get in on it. If there is a "scrap," you'll do far better to stay at the bank. Too much conflict at the bank. -Is that how it seems to you? -Yes, makes the blood run cold. How's Catherine? She's late. She was in at half-past yesterday. Perhaps they're taking the lunch interval later. Lunch interval? This isn't a cricket match, Grace. Nor, may I say, is it a matinee at the Gaiety. Why are you wearing that unsuitable getup? Don't you like it, dear? It's Madame Dupont's best. Grace, your son is facing a charge of theft and forgery. It's so difficult. I can't wear the same old dress day after day. It's repetitious and depressing. I'll tell you what. I'll wear my black coat and skirt tomorrow for the verdict. Yes, that's what I'll do. I'll wear it for the verdict. -Did you say my lunch was ready? -Yes, dear. It's only cold. I made the salad myself. Violet is at the trial. Violet? She was under sentence the last time I saw you. We don't have the courage to tell her. -I have the courage. -Funny that you don't, then. See how these taunts of cowardice are daily flung at my head? Should I take them up? I'm forbidden to move. Such is the logic of women. Will you take him away after the verdict? -He promised to go to a nursing home. -Will he? -How should I know? -If he loses now, he's lost for good. I can only hope that it's true. Lord, the heat! Mother, can't you get rid of those reporters? Hello, Dickie. -Hello. -Come to be in at the death? -Is that what it'll be? -Looks like it. -You're late, Catherine. -I know. I'm sorry. There was such a huge crowd. I have to go and change. A bigger crowd than yesterday? Yes, Mother, far bigger. So how did it go this morning? Sir Robert finished his cross-examination of the postmistress. I thought he'd demolished her completely. She couldn't identify Ronnie in the commander's office. She couldn't be sure of the time he came in. She admitted being called to the phone while he bought his postal order... ...and that all cadets looked alike to her in their uniforms... ...so it might have been another cadet who cashed the 5 shillings. A brilliant cross-examination. He didn't frighten her or bully her. He simply coaxed her into tying herself into knots. Then the attorney general asked her again whether she was positive... ...that the same boy that bought the 1 5-and-6 postal order... ...also cashed the five-shilling one. She said she was quite sure because Ronnie was such a good-looking boy... ...that she'd specially noticed him. She hadn't said that in her examination-in-chief. Ronnie, good-looking? What utter rot. If he was so good-looking why couldn't she identify him the same evening? Ask the attorney general. I'm sure he has a beautifully reasonable answer. Who else gave evidence for the other side? The commander... ...the chief petty officer and a boy at the college. -Anything damaging? -Nothing that we didn't expect. Did you see anyone interesting in court? Yes, Mother. John Watherstone. John? You didn't speak to him, I hope. -Yes, of course I did. -You didn't! -What did he say? -He wished us luck. What impertinence. Is that what it is? I wonder if Violet will remember to get onions. I better get them myself on the way back. Yes, get them on the way back. I'm so sorry, dear. What for, Mother? John. Being such a bad hat. I never did like him very much. No, I know. You're looking well. A trifle thinner, perhaps. Hard work, Father. -Or late hours? -You can't keep late hours in Reading. You could keep late hours anywhere. I had quite a good report about you from Mr. Lamb at the bank. Good old Mr. Lamb. I took him racing last Saturday. Had the time of his life and lost his shirt. Did he? Did he, indeed? Now, Dickie, when we get to the front door... ...put your head down and charge through them all. Why don't you go through the garden? I can't risk this hat going through the roses. I always say, " I'm the maid and I don't know nothing." So don't be surprised. Right-o, Mother. Are we going to lose this case? How's Sir Robert? The papers said he told the judge he felt ill... ...and might ask for an adjournment. I trust he won't collapse. He won't. It was another of those brilliant tricks he boasts about. It got him the sympathy of the court and possibly.... No, I won't say that. Say it. Possibly provided him with an excuse if he's beaten. I see. Come in, Desmond. I trust you do not object to me employing this furtive entry... ...but the crowds in front are most alarming. -Most alarming. -Why have you left court? My partner will be holding the fort. He's perfectly competent. I'm glad to hear it. I wondered if I might see Catherine alone. I have a matter of some urgency to communicate to her. Do you wish to hear this urgent matter, Cate? Yes, Father. I have to be back in court. Perhaps you would give me a moment of your time. Yes, of course, Desmond. It occurred to me during the lunch recess that I had better see you today. Yes? I have a question to put to you which... ...if I had postponed until after the verdict... ...you might have thought had been prompted by pity if we'd lost... ...or if we'd won, your reply might have been influenced by gratitude. And that, of course, wouldn't do. Do you follow me, Cate? Yes, Desmond. I think I do. Then perhaps you have some inkling of what the question is? Yes, I think I have. I ought to have followed the usual practice in such cases... ...and said I had no inkling whatever. Your directness and honesty are two of the qualities I so much admire in you. I'm glad that you've guessed. It makes my task the easier. The facts are these: That you don't love me and never can... ...and that I love you, always have and always will. It is a situation which, after careful consideration, I'm prepared to accept. I reached this decision months ago, but thought it better to wait... ...until this case, which is so much on all our minds, should be over. Then at lunch today, I determined to anticipate the verdict tomorrow. I see. Thank you so much. That makes everything much clearer. There is much more that I meant to say... ...but I'll put it in a letter. Yes, Desmond. Do. -Give me a few days to think it over? -Of course. Of course. I need hardly tell you how grateful-- There is no need, Cate. No need at all. You mustn't keep your taxi waiting. I may expect your answer in a few days? Yes, Desmond. I must get back to court. Well... ...what did you think today? I thought she restored the case with her point about Ronnie's looks. No, not at all. There is still the overwhelming fact that she couldn't identify him. -A brilliant cross-examination. -Brilliant. Strange man, Sir Robert. At times so cold and distant and.... Passionless. And yet, he has a real passion about this case. -Does he? -Yes. I know-- This must, on no account, go any further-- I know he has made a great personal sacrifice to bring it to court. Sacrifice? What, of another brief? That is no sacrifice to him. He was offered-- You really promise to keep this to yourself? Whatever the government offered him can't be as startling as all that. -He's in the opposition. -Indeed. Therefore, a most gracious compliment. And what position was he offered? Yes, that's right. That's right. And he turned it down... ...simply in order to carry on with the case of Winslow v. Rex. Strange are the ways of men, are they not? Goodbye, my dear. -Father, I've been a fool. -Have you, my dear? An utter fool. In default of further information, I can only repeat, " Have you, my dear?" There can be no further information. I'm under a pledge of secrecy. What did Desmond want? To marry me. I trust the folly you referred to wasn't your acceptance of him. Would it be such folly? Lunacy. I'm nearly 30. -30 isn't the end of life. -Is that so? Better far to live and die an old maid than to be married to Desmond. Even an old maid must eat. Did you take my suggestion with regard to your Suffrage Association? -Yes. -You demanded a salary? I asked for one. They'll give it to you? Two pounds a week. No, Father, the choice is quite simple. Either I marry Desmond and settle down into a comfortable... ...and not really useless existence... ...or I go on for the rest of my life in service of a hopeless cause. A hopeless cause. I've never heard you say that before. I've never felt it before. John's getting married next month. I see. I see. Did he tell you? -Yes. He was very apologetic. -Apologetic? It's a girl I know slightly. She'll make him a good wife. Is he in love with her? No more than he was with me. Perhaps a little less. -Why marry her so soon--? -After jilting me? He thinks there'll be a war soon, and if there is... ...his regiment will be among the first to go overseas. She's a general's daughter. Very, very suitable. I'm so sorry. If you could go back and choose again, would your choice be different? Perhaps. I don't think so. I don't think so either. I still say we both knew what we were doing and were right to do it. You won't marry Desmond? In the words of the prime minister, Father, "Wait and see." -What's that boy shouting? -Only "Winslow case latest." It doesn't sound like " latest." Did they win or did they lose? I've got the Winslow case result! In these pages! Winslow case result! There must be some mistake. Oh, sir. Yes, Violet. What is it? I don't know how to tell you. Just after they come back from lunch.... Mrs. Winslow weren't there, nor Master Ronnie. Shouting, the carrying on, you never heard anything like it. Sir Robert standing there at the table with his wig on crooked... ...tears running down his face. Running down his face, they were! Cook and me, we did a bit of crying too. Everyone was cheering. Judge kept shouting. It wasn't any good. The jury joined in. Some of them climbed out of the box to shake hands with Sir Robert. Outside, it was the same. Couldn't move for the crowd. Think they'd gone mad the way they carried on. Some shouting, "Good old Winslow" ... ...some singing, "Jolly good fellow." Cook had her hat knocked off again. She did. Sure as I'm standing here to tell you. Well, sir... ...you must be feeling nice and pleased. Now it's all over. Yes, Violet. I am. I always said it'd come out all right in the end. Yes, you did. Yes, I did. Well, I don't mind telling you, sir. I wondered if you and Miss Cate weren't just wasting your time. Still, couldn't have felt that if you'd been in court today. Mrs. Winslow asked me to remember most particular to pick up onions-- I believe Mrs. Winslow is picking them up herself. Oh, jolly good. Oh, poor madam... ...when she gets to court and finds it's all over. -Well, congratulations, I'm sure. -Thank you. It would appear, then, that we've won. Yes, Father, it would appear that we've won. I would've liked to have been there. Sir Robert Morton. Good afternoon. I thought you'd like to hear... ...the actual terms of the attorney general's statement... ...so I jotted them down for you. "On behalf of the Admiralty," et cetera, et cetera... ..."the cadet, Ronald Winslow, did not write the name on the postal order. He did not take it. He did not cash it. That he is consequently innocent of the charge. This is a full, unreserved... ...and a complete acceptance of his statements." Thank you, Sir Robert. It's hard for me to find the words with which to thank you. Do not trouble yourself to search for them. Let us take conventional expressions of gratitude for granted, shall we? Pity you were not in court. The verdict caused quite a stir. So I heard. Why did the Admiralty resign the case? It was a foregone conclusion. Once the handwriting expert had been discredited... ...l knew we had a sporting chance. But this morning you seemed so depressed. Did l? Perhaps the heat in the courtroom. The gentlemen at the front say to make a statement. They won't go away unless you do. Very well, Violet. Thank you. What shall I say to them? I hardly think it matters, sir. Whatever you say has little bearing on what they write. I could say... ..."This victory isn't mine, it belongs to the people." How does that strike you? A trifle pretentious? Perhaps, sir. I should say it nonetheless. It will be very popular. Perhaps I should just say... ..."Thank God we beat 'em." Miss Winslow... ...might I ask you for a glass of your excellent whiskey? -Yes, of course. -Very kind. I beg your pardon. How remiss of me not to offer you any hospitality. I'll correct that straightaway. What must you think of me? Perhaps you would forgive me in not getting up? The heat in that courtroom was really infernal. Are you all right? Just a slight nervous reaction, that's all. Besides, I've not been feeling myself all day. I told the judge so this morning, if you remember. But I doubt if he believed me. He thought it was a trick. What suspicious minds people have, have they not? Yes. Thank you. I'm afraid I have a confession and an apology to make to you, Sir Robert. I'm sure one is rash and the other is superfluous. I'd rather hear neither. I'm afraid you must. This is the last time I'll see you... ...and it is a better penance for me to say this than write it. I have entirely misjudged your attitude to this case... ...and if in doing so I have ever seemed either rude or ungrateful... ...l am sincerely and humbly sorry. You have never seemed to me either rude or ungrateful. My attitude to this case has been the same as yours: A determination to win at all costs. When you talk of gratitude... ...you must remember that those costs were not mine, but yours. Weren't they also yours, Sir Robert? I beg your pardon? Haven't you too made a certain sacrifice for the case? The robes of that office would not have suited me. Wouldn't they? I intend to have Curry censured for revealing a confidence. I ask you never to divulge it to another soul. I'd like you to forget it. I shall never divulge it. I can't promise to forget it myself. If you choose to endow an unimportant incident... ...with a romantic significance... ...you are perfectly at liberty to do so. Would you show me out another way? Thank you. There you are. I say, Sir Robert... ...l'm sorry. I didn't know anything was going to happen. Where were you? At the pictures. -Pictures? -Cinematograph. I say, we won, didn't we? Yes, we won. How about that! We won. One thing puzzles me. Why are you always at such pains to prevent people... ...knowing the truth about you? -Am l, indeed? -You know that you are. Why? -Who knows the truth about himself? -That is no answer. My dear Miss Winslow, are you cross-examining me? On this point. Why are you ashamed of your emotions? To fight a case on emotional grounds is the surest way to lose it. Is it? Emotions cloud the issue. Cold, clear logic wins the day. Was it cold, clear logic that made you weep today at the verdict? I wept because right had been done. -Not justice? -No, not justice. Right. Easy to do justice. Very hard to do right. Now, I must leave the witness box. Miss Winslow, I hope I shall see you again. One day in the House of Commons. -Up in the gallery. -Yes. In the House of Commons, but not up in the gallery. Across the floor, one day. You still pursue your feminist activities. Oh, yes. Pity. It's a lost cause. Do you really think so, Sir Robert? How little you know about women. Goodbye. I doubt that we shall meet again. Do you really think so? How little you know about men.
