You have nothing to do with it. Take away from me, your dirty hands. And now, Mr. Tupper. Now. So, I do not believe in cheating, Mr. Tapper, but I think you're mistreating with his assistants. I do not like it. This boy works for me and I do with it what I want. Of course, Mr. Tupper. Just tell him that you need from him. And if he does not, you fire him. And if I look again, How did you happen to be managed, I have to do this. No, Ben, do not! And you better listen Mr. Tapper. Work honestly and do it in time. He's your boss. Respect it. Yes, sir.

You heard what I said? And look at me when I'm talking to you! - Oh, Ajax, leave me alone on it. - He should not sit at our table. Come on. Get out. Well, well, there you are, my boy. Col. Castle specifically asked me to find you. Me? This season, you take alias or will you speak under his own name? - I think, under his own. - Under what? - Toby Tyler. - Well, of course. Beautiful name. I always liked it. Can I submit to you Mademoiselle Janet and Monsieur Ajax? I hope you've heard of Toby Tyler. My God, I did not know it was him. Well, too late to apologize. You have breakfast with me and my family? - Yes, sir. - Fine. Come here. Let me introduce myself. My name is Sam Treat, I'm a circus clown. - Clown! - At your service. O. What are you doing here with the circus, Mr. Tyler? I, I ... bu ... Boo-fet-chik. Boo-fet-chik? In the words of Papa Schultz "How can there be a circus without a butler?" Come on. Kids will be happy to meet you. - You have a big family? - In different ways. In most cases, I would say, about four or five people. - Sit down. - Thank you. So, kiddies. Breakfast. God, when you said that you have a family, I thought that you ... Correctly. They are like family to me. I think, not what what you're used to. In truth, I also have no permanent family. So I went to the circus. - Oh! - You know, I fled. - I would never have guessed. - Not because they did not want me to live with them, but because they are terribly poor, and I for them was a stone around his neck. Stone, eh? That's bad. Of course, bad. Have you thought about to go back? I think not. Until such time as I did not earn enough money to help them and prove that I'm not the same as they thought. You know, Papa Schultz always said: "All that thou hast, revert back to you. You should invest into something. " - And who is the father Schultz? - Old Clown, with whom I was close. I have always tried to make people happy as he is. - So I ran away and the circus. - Have you run away? Dad gave me this purse, so I saved money. He said: "The Circus - for elephants and Papa Schultz. And the rest must accumulate money and go home. " But you have not returned. Listen, Toby. Kopi money. Do not wait until it's too late. Thank you, Mr. Treat. I'll collect the money and a lot of work, and do all that I shall command Mr. Tupper, and ... - Oh! - What is it? I forgot. I was waiting for Mr. Tapper. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come on. Nuts, popcorn, apples in sugar. Nuts! Nuts, popcorn, apples in sugar. Nuts, popcorn, apples in sugar. So, guys. Right here - lemonade with ice. Exhilarating. Nuts, popcorn, apples in sugar. Nuts, popcorn, apples in sugar. And now, ladies and gentlemen, you see two extraordinary young Riders with its famous trained stallions. Mademoiselle Jeanette and Monsieur Ajax. Nuts, popcorn, apples in sugar. Nuts ... Hey boy, can not you sit down? Thank you, sir. Lemonade with ice. Pink, cool and refreshing. - Great idea, right? - Yes, sir. Nuts, popcorn, apples in sugar. Lemonade with ice. Pink, cool and refreshing. Dollar, thirty, thirty-five, forty, sixty, sixty-five ... And what's this? You're just a bad beginner. What, can not distinguish between money from a piece of metal? Sorry, Mr. Tupper. I do not know much about the money. Do not know? Okay, I'll teach you. Lesson number one. I'm going to replace your earned five pence a piece of it. Yes, sir. And what do I do with these? - Where did you get them? - They are superfluous. When I wanted to give them back They said: "Let the change itself." This is a guy, what a circus is called "Tip." - Understand? - No. Well. There is an old circus rule. All gratuities belong chief butler. And this is me. - Yes, sir. But if you tell their tips, I share with you equally. So, dime me Five - you. Thank you, sir. But you must promise me, that our agreement will remain confidential. You see, in the circus world to do pretend that you - a heavy man. I do not want me thinking if I slug. And now let's get business and take away all there. You little ... Mr. Tupper will kill me. I want you to be sick! That you got sick and turned green. - He was terribly sick, right? - Well, it's just not very good looking. It was my fault. I do not want him to so very ill. This guy will eat anything. Sometimes I think he's ostrich family. Let's see. Car keys. Stud. Comb? - A piece of rope. - You frightened me. Do not worry about this guy. You can not do anything to him ... He almost Nehru ... indestructible. - You do nothing. - Do you think you can cure it? Is what I do. Reliable old remedy. Castor oil. Give him a spoon, and I also give him a little. God, I wanted us to him became friends. He never for me it is not forgive. Hold tight. Do not let him bite. That's it. Do not let go. That's right, that's right. Hold him tight. I would not want to put him back into the monkey cage. Perhaps it would be correct, so that night he was warm. There. Wrap it in it. Perhaps he can now sleep with me. It is better to ask Ben. He is responsible for the monkeys. Thank you, Mr. Treat. Good night. We'll be friends, however, Stubbs? Stubbs? Why Mr. Stubbs? He reminds me of the old Mr. Stubbs. He manages the store where I lived. Yes, sir, we'll be real friends. We, Mr. Stubbs. I do not understand as you dragged me into it. The Colonel Castle there is rule number one: "Animals should ride in the cells where they belong. " Do not you see that it is already better looking? - In the morning he will feel just as always. - It would be nice. Giddap! Let's go! Toby, get up. Get up. - What time is it? - It's late. Wagon with a rope broke. Maybe I should find Mr. Tapper. - He will be looking for me. - Sit down. We'll go to the parade right in Vudveyl. And then the rope will mend. - You want to say that I could go on parade? - Yes. There. Want to look like a circus performer? Looks like. - A hat for Mr. Stubbs? - Do not even think. Whatever you do, watch the chimps. Do not you think that he is already better Ben? Yes. Hey, I almost forgot. Today is the Fourth of July. So there will be fireworks. Yeah. Big cats oh how it love. Ha. Let's go. Bess, Will carefully! Hold on! Bess, Will! Wait, you immedi ... Jump, Toby, jump! There is a child under the car. There's a baby. Beware! Beware! Beware! Call an ambulance! - Toby, are you all right? - Yes, of course. Thanks, guys. - How did it happen? - Chimpanzees rid of him, scared and frightened the horses. - How is he rid of him? - It's my fault. He was sitting upstairs with me. You know the rules, Ben. You're fired. Come to me after the show. Monkey! Ollie, Omaha, catch them before how they are turned upside down the entire city. Mr. Stubbs. He is rid of him. Keep on moving cars. Close them. Mr. Stubbs! Hide! Hey, son, get off. That chimp pulled my gun 45 caliber. Mr. Stubbs! Stay at the bottom. He was the last cartridge. Calm down, guys. This was the last bullet. Sheriff. - Wait! - Get away! I was very hurt, but I have to kill him until after he had someone to not kill. - No! - Hey, come back! Hello, hello, Mr. Stubbs. It's me, Toby. Careful, kid. Do not trust him. O horror! We're friends, Mr. Stubbs, remember? Be careful with the gun. Good boy. Quietly. Quietly, Mr. Stubbs. Quietly. Nice guy, Mr. Stubbs. Quietly. Give me. Please. No, Mr. Stubbs, no! Mr. Stubbs! Late to apologize. Come on. He did not know what he is charged. This chimpanzee is able to well handle with weapons. Yes, maybe you should to elect him to parliament. - Where do you go? - Just go. Free country. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. Think buy the stables, of which you speak? Maybe. Then, happily. Come, come. Why Ben did not tell him, it's my fault? You know why Ben is so big? Because it is filled with pride. Okay, Ben, the day passed quietly. Those who escaped monkey got us at best a small business for the entire season. I received a telegram from our man from Kingsville. They say they have sold all the "blues." And listen. "The monkeys captured Woodvale. "The boy disarms shooting chimps. "Animals are celebrating Independence Day, leaving on vacation for freedom. " He smashed the car was the most the best thing that could happen. Where are you razodelsya? Wanted to scare the animals? I went for salaries, Colonel. - Salary? Where is it? - You're fired me today. Oh, do not, Ben. You know me. I'm just very angry. What is the meaning in my position, If I can not offend people. Pay me what they should. Enough rattle of money. Where is the boy, Tyler? Toby? On the street. - And he's here with me? - Toby? Toby Tyler, come here. Therefore, Toby, I want you and chimpanzees tomorrow were going to monkey cage. On you want to see guys from Kingsville. Chimpanzees at the top of the seat? Are you crazy? Because of this, and started this whole scandal. When you are responsible for this thing, I have nothing to fear. Well, no. No, sir. I have nothing to buy. Toby, I want to thank you for being that you saved the life of this chimpanzee. This is my pet. I think I was supportive violators of the order. - That's why I like the old Ben. - Colonel ... You seem to be well able to cope with the chimpanzees. Would you like to care for it? Do not allow him to play pranks? - Are you serious, sir? - It's your duty. And now you can go. Thank you, sir. Listen, Colonel, I think it does not work. Why are you standing here? Disguise costume and drive cars. Until Kingsville far. Welcome home, Ben. - Where were you? - I was ... I do not care that Colonel Castle indicates that a chimp. Just be sure that it is not tears you from working. I need to leave the case to the city. - You all remember what I told you that? - Yes, sir. Make sure that all the money kept a green safe, that there is enough water banks, and that today is Saturday. - Saturday? - Yes, sir. Today, you have to pay me. I gave you within two weeks? I'm saving up to, sir. This is a piece of metal, Mr. Tupper. Correctly. Just wanted to check how do you stand on your feet. Take it. And ensure that the chimpanzee and closely not suited to my safe. I will not be long, And I want you to monitor everything what should be done. Yes, sir. Have you ever seen so many money, Mr. Stubbs? Three dollars 47 cents. I'm almost rich. How surprised Uncle Daniel, when I bring home all the money. Come on. I'm better than you'll tie. Come on. I must bind you. Sit down here. So, do not move. That's it. Come on. That's it. Sit down. I have a fully working, Mr. Stubbs. I'd better move fast. Hello. Come on. Come on. What do I see? Great seller nuts. Death defying daredevil with the lemonade tray. Come on, Ajax. We have long since you have not seen. Well, Mr. Tupper wants that I succeeded. Yes, of course. He has an important job. - Were evicted from the lemonade flies. - Do not pay any attention to him, Toby. And I do not pay. Compared with Mr. Tapper it more friendly. - Nice horse. - Do you love horses? What could know about horses Seller nuts? - Hey, Jeannette, look. - Oh. I know something about horses. It just so happens that I have was the horse. - The Truth, Toby? - He was called Old Red. Well, actually, he was not old. Just the name is. - He is a horse that can move hodoy? - Move hodoy? You know what path he loves best? Probably the one that leads out to pasture. - There is so much fun clowns. - Toby, you're kidding. Hey, Jeanette. Look at me. - Fine. - Do not look at him. He thinks that when he was in the ring, everyone in the world should stop and look at it. Tell me more about the old chestnut. He can jump? Hey, Jeanette! Ajax, you know that the colonel said, What about training without a belt. What's the difference? Just watch. Ajax. - Ajax. - Get away from me. - Very bad. - Move it under the canopy. Wear. Cautiously with his foot. Under it with both hands. Easy, easy. Call a doctor quickly. Who is responsible? Who gave him permission to train without a belt? - And where were you? - I was ... Okay. I now do not care. What to do? Well, just climbed to the top, all flew down the chimney. What do we do? - Colonel? - What? - Toby Tyler knows how to ride. - Who? - Who? - It's true. He rides a horse since childhood. His house has a horse. You. Toby. Excuse me, sir. I'll be back to the tent with lemonade. - You can ride a horse? - I? Well, sir, I just went to the farm, and all. It does not matter. Do you have experience. I'll take care of the rest. - But I do not think ... - That's good. Do not think. Jeanette, come and stand beside with Toby. Let's see what we have. So-so. They suit each other, as two pair of boots. - What do you think, Ben? - Wait for the Colonel. Yes, sir, we can settle everything, Let's approach, if correct this issue. - Yes, Sam? - I think it's a great idea, Colonel. Now listen to me, Toby. Come to an agreement. We're from you will do an excellent rider. It's not easy, but in the near future this should happen. But, sir, I'm working on Mr. Tapper. We have a gentleman's agreement. - About Tupper I'll see. Well, we start right tomorrow morning. In two weeks we will be already in Waterford. By the time the boy should ride. Now get down to business. - It is in your hands. - But, Colonel, just two weeks. Well, I gotta go. Prior to the meeting. - See you soon. - You heard what the colonel said. It is in our hands. Of course. But, Colonel, this is not fair. Toby Tyler - the best boy of all, who I was. You can not have me pick it up. Enough whining and get out of here. - Find yourself another boy. - I do not want another. His love to buyers. He brings a tip. I wanted to say, money. - Listen, Tupper, if you ... So, Colonel, nothing to threaten me. I know that you are sophisticated people. On you go to various rumors. But I never heard you deceitful and dishonest. So, nothing to suck. Well ... I just feel I'm responsible for that boy. He could get hurt among those horses. Ben will trace him. You know that. Yes. I'm just not so easy agree with this. What do you think, how much recognition this fact? I would not want to transfer all the money. But, maybe $ 40 a week? I think your conscience is less. - Let there be ten. - And how about thirty? - Okay, fifteen. - Colonel ... I would like to help you. I'll tell you what. No, Mr. Tupper. I'll tell you what I do. I'll give you twenty dollars a week. And if you pronounce a single word ... This is an honest offer. I just draw on a piece of paper. - What? - Gentleman's Agreement. If you and I can not trust each other, what to say about the rest? - Get out of here! - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Ben? - Yes? - Have you ever cheated? - Like everything. But it stopped. Strongly much trouble. Any fool can tell a lie. And then still lies come out, and will be a lot of trouble. It is not worth it. Ben, I lied, too. - Do not tell anyone. - I do not know how to ride. Do not know how. I know. - When are you going to leave? - How did you guess? In the purse, probably a whole bunch of coins. Do not be surprised if you buy a ticket to home and you still left with enough money, to give to Uncle Daniel. You're going to take care of Mr. Stubbs? He does not know that I am leaving. - He did not die of hunger. - Someday I'll come back and redeem it. Of course. Why do a little nap? Ben? In addition to Mr. Stubbs' my best friends - you and Sam. I would be hard to say goodbye. Nothing to worry about it. A few weeks later you'll forget how I look. I'll never forget you, Ben. Sleep. Toby. Toby. Better get up. You've come a long day. Yes, sir. Mr. Stubbs. My money. Where are they? Where is my money? What do you do with them? Speak! Speak! Say, Mr. Stubbs! What have you done with my money? Speak! Tell me, Mr. Stubbs, tell me! - What is it? - Ben, Mr. Stubbs threw my money. I was searching everywhere. Thus, chimpanzee-thief. Why did you do, Mr. Stubbs? - Easy, Toby. - Here is what I have left after we had became friends. If I remember correctly, Colonel Castle said you were for him to answer. You did it myself took, huh? Nobody is forced. - No. - Then do not blame the chimp. But, Ben, because all my money all that I had accumulated was gone. Do you think you have a problem only with the money? Ha! It is too easy. There. Take what I have accumulated. You have enough to get home and still remain. Come on. Take it and get out of here has not yet got into anything. You mean to say that he changed his mind scoot? Do you want to continue to deal this ungrateful chimp? You want to get into the ring and think how to solve all the problems in which you myself through? Well. At 11 am I hope to see you in the ring. And do not think that this toy. It's a great trick, but first Let's learn to stand. Ago. Ago. No, no. You must move in one the direction of the horse. Keep your foot on each side, and head in the middle. Retain the flexibility of the body. That's it. Carefully. Carefully. Up, up, up. Stay low. Now try to feel it movement with his feet. Go with him in the leg. Do not fight. And now, on his knees. Stand up. Arise! - Wait for the horse. Hold on. Oh no. You must go to him on horseback, and not to kiss him. No, no, no. Get thee behind his ears. Stand up. - Hold on. - Does not work. I can not. - This is what I said Ajax. - Said? He said that you podozhmesh the tail and throw everything on the first day. - Yes? I'll show him. - And now let go of the rope. Let go. That's better. Not very good, but better. And now slazit from a horse. Come on down. - Get ready to pounce with a fork. - Now? Yes, now. And this time watch for synchronicity. On your marks ... Warning ... Go! I missed it. Not bad for a beginner. After dinner, going to play over the bar. Ollie Madden. Madame Tenzin. For you two. Greta Nelson. Toby Tyler. - Harris Tilford. - Toby is busy. I tell him. Frank Vernon. Harry Birch. Rufus Rakin. "Dear Toby, We are very hard. I'm afraid that your uncle Daniel feels bad. Without your help it is very difficult cope with the work on the farm. You really need us, Toby ... " - Mr. Tupper! - You dropped something. - Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Well, how's the new artist? Horrible, but Ben said After lunch return. My boy, I believe in you. And to prove that Harry Tupper not just a talker, Look what I have for you is. Best used shoes for the ride for the price you can afford. And now answer my question. Mr. Tupper - your friend or not? - Well ... - No need to thank me, boy. You forgot about all their responsibilities. Run and met his friend, Mr. Stubbs. Mr. Tapper? I do not know how to say What about you but I changed my opinion. Yes. You could have this and not speak. I admit that I am not the most patient man in the world. But since a typically behaving when calculating to someone. Am I right? Ben? What do you think I should tell you aunt and uncle that I would ride a horse? Why not. Do you think I can go well? Well, you have not yet Pouni Bill But before we begin to speak, thou shalt be a professional - or I'm not Benjamin Badiah Cotter. Ben? How to write an "uncle"? Uncle? Well, it's ... differently. At one point you write one, in each other. In what we now place? No spelling or letter is important. It is important how you express it. You said guys like you for it bored? - No. - And you said that you love them? For them, it is of great importance. I love you very much. Cordially ... Ben, how to write a "heart"?
