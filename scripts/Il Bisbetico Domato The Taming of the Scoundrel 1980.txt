I am here for another reason. Id like to get info, gossips.. .. about a famous farmer in this area - Who is he? Elia Codogno. Elia! What did he do? - Nothing. Today its is 40th birthday. What kind of person is he? Bad mood. A bear, despotic and bossy. - He has no friends. - Is he really unmanageable? He can even fight with the barber! After he cut his hair he put the mirror behind his head and he said they were too short. When my daughters had a party and played some music. - He sued me for making noise. You live 2km away from him! He said I woke up his chickens! Elia sued everybody in this town. Even me. - Who are you? I am the judge. - Is Elia married? - Dont mention women, or hell smash your head. He doesnt want to see anybody. - Does he live alone? - He has a servant... shes trying to find him a wife. On Sunday she invited a woman at home. He dressed up like Frankenstein. The poor girl was so scared she ran away. Is he coming here today? - He already did. Hes playing tennis now. Do still people want to play with him? Out! Your match! Ill kill you! Surrender!

But you have a very bad behavior. What? I bad behavior? (altogether) Yes, you do! Really? You say this because you are in a group, but one by one... - Do I have a bad behavior? Yes. - You are a brave man. People say hes grumpy because hes not married. Am I grumpy because not married?... I understand! You, married man, you dare to say that? The marriage ruined your life! Women have changed you. Nothing to say about you. I pity you. You had a forest on your head! You were slim! Move away, Easter egg.. - You were a champion of arm wrestling. - Right, so what? So, show me how strong you are, married man! You were 2.40mt, tall and you could spot a bird one miles away. And now you cant even spot your own! You pity me? I feel fine, and strong. Can any of you do this at 40 years old of age? Well done! Hes good! With no hands. - Good morning, Elia. - Good morning. Whistling Move on! Jump! Higher! Come on! Father Cirillo! - Hi.

I believe there are moments of passion and desire. uncontrollable impulses, moments of torments when the flesh is torn apart. - Dont you have such moments? - Sure. - And what do you do then? - I go into the wood hut and cut the woods. And you? I ring the belles. Do you ring them often? Bye, Cirillo. See you around. Come on, guys! Lets ring the bells. I mean, lets play basketball. Come on! Jump! Tonio, this is not a sowing season. - This is wheat for the crows. Feeding the crows means that you are a nice person. - Which kind of wheat is it? - Its poisoned. So they will all die! - Not even one will be left! - Why you do that? Dry season, and the crows too! I plant oat, and they eat it. I plant corn, and they eat it. And what shall I eat? - If I dont kill them, Ill starve. - Why dont you talk to them. What do you mean? They are all black and ugly! They should die all at once! THE CROWS CAW Shut up!

I studied music at the conservatory. During the final exam I played Notturno 18 from Chopin. I play for myself... .. to improve my soul. Music improves our own sensations. I dont need to work. I inherited a good sum of money. When Ill decide to get married, if Ill ever find the right person... I am not looking for a prince. I dont need him to be handsome. Appearance is not everything.
