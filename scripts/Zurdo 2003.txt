What are the stakes? Well, my marble against yours. Right! An Aggie against a Zebra. -Pull out an Aggie, then. -We only play from zebras up. We don't have one of those. Got it! We bet you ten Aggies and five Cat Eyes... ...against our Zebra. Seven Aggies. -Eight. -Deal. LEFTY Damned rascal! Now that I was about to defeat him. Let's have a match between us, yeah? Ok! On top of missing school! -Here he is, Don Emilio. -There. It's just tightening this screw, now. -There it is, Don Pichi. -Yeah, thanks, son. Shall I leave food for you, Thomas? No, thanks, Lefty. I'm not eating here. -Start it up. -Let's see if it's true. Great. Look after the shop, Don Pichi. Look after the shop, look after the shop... ...but where's my pay? Need a ride? -Deal! -Let's go! Ready! This is as far as I go, Lefty. See you... Thanks. Come here! Come here! Come here! What's up, nephew? Don Emilio must be getting rich out of us. ''Cocoon...'' ''Cocoon...'' ''Cocoon...'' ''Cocoon...'' ''Cocoon...'' ''Cocoon...'' -Hey, my name is not ''Cocoon''. -''Cocoon''. So? Will you get me those pyrotechnics? Don't worry. Hey, Guicho! Where are you going? Mr. Mendoza, I need an extension. I'm sorry. That was the deal. You should have thought about it before borrowing it. And do what? Let the roof collapse over me? With all the money I've paid you... ...now I owe you more than you lent me. I already explained to you how interest works. But I don't have enough. I'll never be able to raise the money. Hey, Martina, I've already told you... Either you pay me the note that you owe me... ...next week and all the rest by the end of the month or... ...you'll have to vacate. Is that clear? Lefty, don't start playing! Your mother told you to go straight home, o.k.? What? Are you gonna chicken out? Come on, we won't take long. You'll do it in a snap. Get out of my way! Take that, jerk! Let's see, measure it. Not even if you stretch it, man. What? The rematch? -What are you betting now? -The same, if you want. No... ...make it... ...fifteen Cat Eyes against our Zebra. Deal. Stop staring at my sister! And you...! What are you doing here? Hey! You don't own this place! All right! Shoot! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! I said out of the way! Why don't we raise the stakes? How about your marble holder against... ...Centennial? No, I can't. My dad brought it to me from abroad. -It's a centennial! -Don't be a fool! It's too risky. The marble holder is cool... ...but it's not worth a Centennial. Besides, it's the only one we have. The only one we've ever seen! Don't worry. -Let's go. -Loser shoots first. -What if he lucks out...? -No. No cheating this time, Ok, Fatso? I'm not a cheater. Yeah, right. You're going to break all my glasses. So... so... sorry, Don Emilio. You're always dropping them. A cold one. In a mug. All right! You were running late today. Pour me a cold one. I heard about your losses yesterday. You'd better get a job... ...set a good example for your kids. You think gambling is not work? Carmita, what are you doing here? Come here. My turn. What do you mean it's your turn? His marble did not hit mine and this game... ...is called ''Hit and hand- spread''. Right! Now you're going to teach Lefty... ...how to play hit and hand-spread. Ok, I'll give you a chance. Shoot again. What do you mean ''shoot again''! -Did he hit it or not? -No, not at all. All right, Fatso. If that's how you want it. Yeah, that's how I want it. I'm not giving it to you! If I do, my mom will whip my butt. Not your mom! I'll be the one to whip your butt... ...if you don't hand it over! -You and how many others? -Just me! What's with you, jerk! You're always freeloading at my place! You're a cheater, just like your dad! Shut up about my dad! You don't even have one! Lefty must've beaten Basilio again. He always beats everybody. There will never be anyone who can beat... ...the Wizard of Santa Maria. You're the one who wanted to bet, didn't you, Fatso? Are you Ok? It's a good thing you're a good fighter, otherwise... We're a team, aren't we? You're not fighting, are you? -No. -No. Lefty! What are you doing here? Your mom's waiting for you! The Wizard is a professional. Not a scoundrel... ...who plays against neighborhood kids. Believe it or not, nobody has ever beaten Lefty. Around here we've seen him win since he was a little kid. -Yeah. -Until his day comes. By then we will all be dead. And Lefty won't be playing marbles anymore. This Lefty hits marbles. The Wizard kills them. Well, Lefty buries them. -Let's see... bring him on. -I will, then. Gee, it's really late. My mom's going to be mad. Chill out. Just show her the marble holder and she'll be happy. Don't be silly! You should think about getting married. You kidding? I came to get away from one man. Why would I get involved with another. Tomas is a nice guy. You never told me what happened... ...with Alejandro's father. We met in the city. I was passing by and just like that. We met and... Just like that we fell in love. Well, that's what I thought because... ...we agreed to meet one day but he never showed up. I never heard from him again. You mean, he doesn't know he has a son? It's about time! What happened to you? Look at you, you're a mess! -Nothing, Mom! -What do you mean? You've been fighting again? Go deliver this laundry! What's wrong? They're taking the house away from me. How much do you need? Lefty! What are you doing here? The door was open. -Why are you crying? -No, I'm not crying. Nephew... How are you doing? Six months away and we've already got enough... ...for the festival. Everybody chipped in. -Well, almost everybody. -Isn't Mendoza going to chip in? Like hell! That loan shark? -He never goes to the party. -So what? It's a tradition and we all do our part. Well, yeah. Where are you going? You think she killed someone? How can you think my aunt would kill anybody? So, buy me a soda and I'll help you... ...deliver the laundry. Deal? -Wait for me here. -Yeah. -What can I get you, Lefty? -Two large cokes, please. So this is Mr. Big shot marble player? The very same one. Your change, son. Isn't true. Don Emilio, how many times... ...have we seen him leave that Basilio on the ground. One thing for sure... ...no one can beat Lefty at marbles. How many rascals has he beaten? How long since we've been watching him win? Mom's going to kill me! You soiled all the laundry! Why did you leave it there? Don't go selling alcohol to minors, Don Emilio. What's up, brother-in-law? Working hard? -Hey, Don Emilio... -Let me tell you that... ...this is a marble shooter's neighborhood. No. Not like Santa Maria. You'll see. Not even God can beat Lefty. -You got that right! -And who claims otherwise? I'm just saying that in Santa Maria... ...we have the best marble shooter in the country. If not the whole world. Well... put your money where your mouth is. You've got it. Well, I'm in. -So am I. -Me too. I thought you didn't have money to pay me back? How about $500 a piece? What? Scared? I'll bet five grand. Let's see them. Put them up yourself, Don Emilio. From the commission we spoke about. I'll bet one... hun... hun... hundred. When shall we have the match? Sunday the 29th? Done. You think this Wizard is really that good? Give me a hand with that one. But it won't dry in time. We'd better use the washing machine. It's faster. Are you crazy? That thing can't even be used. No one is going to find out. Besides, we don't even know how. We can figure it out. See? I told you it wasn't going to get dry. Take it out of the machine. But it's still wet. Yeah... Mom said to tell you she was sorry. She didn't have time to dry it. But I gave it to her last week. Please excuse her. If you want I'll put it out to dry... ...but she's really been very busy. I'm keeping the cost of the drying. Sign this receipt. Oh, Lefty... use your right hand. You see? You shouldn't miss school so often. Where's Lefty? I'm helping him out because he had to make other deliveries. Thanks, son. Put it there. Tell Lefty that I'm taking this load... ...as his contribution to the temple. Martina hasn't contributed in a long time. Who is it? Just look what you did to my son! It wasn't me. Yes, it was him and he took away my marble holder. That's not true! You'd better give it back right now or else! -I didn't take it! I won it! -Give it back to him! -That's mine, too! -The Centennial is mine! And pay Mom what you owe her. I'm not paying you anything. I'll count this as a payback for what you did to my son. Besides, your mother owes us a lot of money. Wait while I count it! But it is soaking wet! How does your mother dare send us wet laundry? It's outrageous! This is the last time I'll send her laundry. This is what you get trying to help people out. Hey, gifts, are not to bet with, what if you loose it? I wasn't going to lose it. You saw how I defended it... ...when they tried to take it away. And now I only have my aunt's money... ...the teacher's incomplete. And on top of it, Carmita gets mad. You'll have to deal with ''Pavis''! Yeah, yeah, ''Pavis'', ''Pavis''. So, have you got your dough? You're not holding out on me, are you? Is that all? You need a beating to collect more, sonny. I can't even use this for a bet on you. Let him go or I'll drop this block on your heads! You have to report that the Goatsuckers robbed you! No, Mom! I don't like to go in there! Let's see, Lefty, where did you get the money... ...to have a soda with your pal at Don Emilio's? Millito sprang for us. Son, the way things are going you shouldn't be wasting money. Right, I spent it all on two sodas. Hi, Martina! Where have you been, Lefty? We've been looking for you all afternoon. What did he do now? Nothing bad, Martina. On the contrary. With Lefty we're gonna have a champ in Buenaventura. Yes. We've set up a match for you... ...with the best marble player in Santa Maria. And even as good as you are, you need to practice. Don Emilio, Alejandro doesn't have time for that. He has to study, deliver lunch and laundry... Don't worry, Martina. We'll figure out a way... ...to take care of all that. And we could all make some money. What do you think, Lefty? Wake up, Alejandro! Wake up! Your Dad's over there! Wake up, Alejandro! Wake up because he's leaving! Wake up! -Mom! -What's wrong? -I saw my Dad! -Your Dad? But you don't know him! No, but he was here... with you. The problem is I couldn't see his face. I couldn't wake up. I'm going to be... be... bet more. How come? So that the doctor cures me and sp... sp... speak right. That thing you have, you have it here... ...and with what we win I can set up a greenhouse... -So you're gonna bet on Lefty? -I don't bet. Well, I'll bet for you. And I'll help you with your business. I don't rely on bets... or any man. That's why I work. No, no, Sebastian! You're not going to bet it! Give it to me! No! I'm going to double it! Juanjo says that nobody beats Lefty. Don't you dare or I'll tell my brother! Oh, I'm shaking in my boots. Give it back! It's the money for the delivery! Shut up or... I'll deliver you a punch! I can't stand him anymore. He took everything. Why do you keep having kids with him? All he knows how to do is gamble. So where's the match? No... this time he's betting it all on Lefty. Neither you and I deserve to live among this garbage. What were you daydreaming about, nephew? At least today I'm gonna get a break from Don Emilio's food. No. If you're a left handed, use your left hand. Yesterday we went to see Romo to accuse the Goatsuckers. -You can't trust Romo. -Mom says he was your friend. Yes, long time ago. That's why I'm telling you. Uncle... yesterday I went to your house. Yes, I know. Your aunt was crying yesterday because... ...we won't be able to have the kid we were expecting. Why not? 'Cause there're things we can have and others we can't. And you? I hear you're playing in a championship. Well, yes, but Mom doesn't want me to. She says I don't have time for it. I don't think so either. -So, why don't you want to? -Because... I'm embarrassed. Why are you embarrassed? Because everybody is betting all this money on me. Don Emilio bet $500. Tomas, another $500. $500 from Sebastian... ...$5000 from the cop... ...plus $100 from the stutterer, makes $6,600. Plus, if the stranger added another $6,600... ...so the odds are even. Very well, Milito... ...but let's see if you can use other examples. Ok, but let's see if you can stop tying up... ...that very valuable hand. I've got a surprise for you. -What's this? -It's for your mom. To make up for what the Goatsuckers stole from us. Really? I borrowed them from my dad. And how are we going to pay it back? Well... I have money I'm betting on you. No, Milito. I still don't know if I'll play. Well, now you do have to play! -Are you still mad at me? -Yes, and you know why. Forgive me. I hear you're going to play. They say the Wizard is really good. I'm better. Well, we'll see, won't we? I don't know why she's so concerned about having kids. She knows we can't. Because... ...we women like to have a child with the man we love. I told her it doesn't matter. I love her just the same. Anyway... for me, this is my son. Stir things up so everybody will bet. It won't be hard since they're already hooked. Then, keep touch with Santa Maria. Find out how good this Wizard is. And how are bets running over there. I'll see if I can help you out somehow. No, no. On top of leaving me this house and... ...with what you are already helping. And you... forget the embarrassment. You're very good at marbles. I want to play. But what if I lose? Just play the way you know. Here, Mom. This is the money that the Goatsuckers stole from us. -Where did you get it? -Milito lent it to me. Oh, don't go asking for loans. Look what a fix we're already in. You also sell perfumes? Are you interested in one? Only to give it to you. Do you want one as well? Rene! Lefty, we need to start training. There's less than four weeks left. -Lefty is gonna win. -What do you think, Lefty? I don't have anymore! Don't lie. You turned four tricks. I still can't afford it. And then there're guys who don't pay what they owe me. That's not my problem! -You deal with it! -Oh, just get off my case! You see? You scared the kid. Hi, Tomas...long time no see! It's been a while since your last visit. Yeah... Let's go, Lefty. Leave the kid alone... He's too young for that stuff. Quiet! Quiet! Well, I've called this meeting... ...because as some of you already know... ...some guy from Santa Maria came here bragging that... ...they have a marble shooter who's better than Lefty! So we have organized a match for Sunday the 29th. Here, with the support of the commander... ...who will be the contact with the people from Santa Maria... ...we'll have an unforgettable match! Even though everyone has chipped in for... ...the Buenaventura festival, we still need a little more... ...since there will be some organizational expenses. It's about time Buenaventura won something! Right? Well, I'd like to inform you that the bets are being placed... ...and if you wish, I can hold them. And well, that was it. Enough, enough now! You settle down because you settle down! Are you in? Yes. Your commander had bet $5000 but he took them back. He claims cops can't bet. He probably got scared, because yesterday... ...he and I went to Santa Maria to see the Wizard. Really? Pretty impressive! But I have a lot of faith in Lefty. Buenaventura will win! What? Are you backing out now? No... Don't you trust the champ of Buenaventura? Yes, we trust him! Long live Lefty! Long live Lefty! Long live Lefty! Long live Lefty! Long live Lefty! What's up? Mom says she'll take the loan you offered her... -...after all. -Don't be embarrassed. That's what friends are for. Ask your mom if she can raise the hem up to here. And of course I'll pay her for it. The loan is a different matter. Wait. Take your shoe off. Take it off! So they don't mug you... again. Are you sick? No. Can I do anything to help you? Win that game. Hi, Dorita. I wanted to chat with you. -About what? -About the vendor's license. But, I already showed it to you. The import license. I don't sell imported goods! Now get out of my house! Sure you do! What about those perfumes... ...that make you smell... ...so good? They are not imported! Now, get out! Why don't you put on the hood, son? It's falling ashes. -Did she give it to you? -Yes. Here it is. She also gave me... -What do we do now? -We should turn him in. Let's go, then. The problem is, these things never go through. Specially if I accuse him. He owed me one. Stay here. Don't say anything to anybody. It would just make matters worse. Stop searching, Bro. The dough's in here. Look how rich this creep is getting by selling nails. Now we can really place a bet, buddy! I don't know exactly when the bitch knocked me out. I'll provide you with the booze. Don Emilio is crazy if he thinks... ...we'll let him run this show. I need you to be ready to provide rooms and services. You see? If you had supported me to have more rooms... Your girls need to convince their customers. That way we'll encourage the guys from Santa Maria... ...to place bigger bets. You think so? Come on, Pavis, you're such a dope. That's what happens from hanging out... ...with too many broads. Tomorrow I'm going to Santa Maria. I'll see how things are going over there. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! We've found out that the guys... ...from Santa Maria have bet their festival money. -We can't stay behind, right? -No, no... Since we're so confident in Lefty's triumph. We may as well bet... ...Buenaventura's festival money too. Right? Hey, that's a great idea! Since we're all agreed, it's a done deal. Excuse me, excuse me! Can we keep this to ourselves? Let's not tell the women or we'll all be... ...in big trouble, right? No, no, no... Tell me later. I was looking for you. Don't you know that our beliefs are against gambling? Have you seen what they're investing their money in? I'm going to explain the rules. This is the playing field. The players... ...shoot from here. The one who gets his marble closest to this line... ...is the one who starts. Lefty, I'm glad you're here. Could you explain the game of ''Hit and Hand-spread'' to us? The play field is circular. The first player must try to get as close as he can... ...to the center of the circle... ...in order to make it harder for the second player... ...who will try to hit the other player's marble... ...and remain at a distance less or equal to a hand-spread. In that case, the marble that is hit... ...becomes part of a new collection. Thanks, Lefty. You can go practice now. -What are you waiting for? -For you to pay me. Here. They'll play up to 60 points... or marbles. -How are we doing, Don Emilio? -Splendidly. Well, then... Good luck to you all. Don't be afraid. Nothing is going to happen to you. We're going to give you protection. Don't you see that the guys from Santa Maria... ...can come in the night and kidnap you? Or kill you? So, Lefty, we're gonna be your bodyguards. So nothing happens to you. -I don't have money to pay you. -Don't worry. We'll make a collection for your safety. That's better, isn't it? Leave it like that. It's very good. You may leave. The teacher is treating you well, isn't she? If not, you know... we'll fix her. Well... she even let me leave, didn't she? And your buddy? No. Not him. How are you gonna get along without your manager? He took everything. And you're pushing people to bet! I'll deal with him later. Don't worry. Lefty is gonna help me get out of this damn place. And I'll take you with me. Are you betting too? Hey, Lefty. Won't you practice your short game? Whatever, Don Emilio. But don't worry. I'm going to win. You need to tell me if he took the marble holder from you... ...or if he won it. I won't get mad. He won it. Well, there's already a lot of money in the pot. And that's not counting the festival money. Basilio confessed that he cheated on you. Hey, you think you can beat this Wizard? They claim he's really good. I haven't seen him play... ...but... I have never been beaten. So, how's your mom doing? Badly. All right. I'll leave you now. Hi, Lefty, how is it going? You like that one? For my girlfriend... no. Look... this one's very soft. Come here, Lefty! You'll find the best here! -Hurray for Lefty, our champ! -Hurray! -You better win or else! -Of course he's gonna win! How's your lemonade? You can imagine I didn't call you here to buy you lemonades. I don't know, because... ...lately everyone's been buying me lemonades. Let's get to the point, then. Tomorrow... ...you're gonna lose to the Wizard. Why? Because if you lose, you'll get a big reward. Your mom's about to lose her house... ...because she owes a lot of money to Mr. Mendoza. Well, if you lose... ...Mr. Mendoza is willing to wait a year to be paid. If you win... You'll both be out on the street. So what do you think? Oh, and if you want... ...we'll talk when you become a man. Make no mistake... If you win the match, you lose your house. And if you tell anyone about this conversation... ...instead of calling you Lefty... ...they'll call you One Hand. Why won't you tell me what he said to you? Tell me! What did he say? Why did he call you? For nothing, nothing. Tell us if he did something to you and we'll fix him. Why did he want you? To... wish me good luck. Now leave me alone! This is quite a bundle you've put together, huh? Who is it? It's me. Please open up. -I'm going to hide. -But why? Romo told me my mom would lose her house if I win. And if I say anything, he'll cut my hand off. -How? -I don't know how... ...with a knife, I guess. I'll hide in the quarry. When my mom finds out, tell her not to worry. Please don't tell anyone. He really may cut off my hand. What are you doing, son? Nothing, Dad... I just heard a noise. -Why are you closing the door? -Because... ...it was open. Open? Ernestina! What? The festival money! It's been stolen! -Did you see anything? -No, Dad! Did you see anybody? Tell me! And how did they find it? -I really didn't! -Who took the money? I did, but only a little bit. What do you mean by little bit! The box is empty! Besides, that money is not even ours! We bet it on Lefty! You bet the festival money? Don't go spreading that around. This is a very delicate matter. And what now? You're soaked! -Will you come down? -All right, I'm coming. Well, well, well! What are you doing here? Tomorrow is an important day. Or, were you thinking on running away? It seems you did not understand me... ...right? You have to play and lose the match. It's not the same if you don't show up. And for your safety... ...you'll stay here. Something happened and I don't know... All his marbles were on the floor. I don't know... Don't worry. He'll show up. You go to Martina's house in case he goes back... ...and you go to the police station with Don Emilio. I never liked this business about the match. My son doesn't have to please all those lazy bums... ...that are only thinking on gambling. All because of that man who came here... ...and made this place go mad. In that case I'm also responsible, Martina. Hey! I can't find my son. He disappeared. My son, my son is gone! He's here. He ran away and we found him. -What's he doing here? -He's in there, sleeping. -Why didn't you notify me! -She has to see her son! If you know something, tell me! I really don't know anything! If something happens to him... ...you'll feel guilty the rest of your life. He told me he was going to go hide in the quarry. But don't tell him I told you. -Lefty disappeared! -How? He escaped. I had him and now everybody is looking for him. You're such an idiot! Now look for him... ...and find him first. How did this scoundrel manage to get away? Why should you care? You didn't bet on him. What do you know about it, idiot! Let's go to the quarry. What happened? I don't know, we left him at his house. Don't worry, we'll find him. Carmita! Come here right now! You have no business with these scoundrels! But Lefty's disappeared, Dad! So what do you care about that brat? I don't want to play anymore. This game... ...is not my game anymore. So play your game. For your honor. Look what I got for you. Freeze! Don't move! What's wrong with you, Romo? Put it down, it's me! Oh, so you're trying to kidnap Lefty, huh? No! He told me I had to throw the match... ...or Mom would lose her house! I don't know what he's talking about! Help him! Yes, uncle. He told me to lose... ...and if I told anybody he'd cut my hand off. You're a traitor and a coward! So now you know... ...if you say anything... ...his life is in danger. You'll see him again after the match. And like I said! When you're a man, we'll talk! Cocoon! Take Lefty with you! I'll take care of this jerk! -Uncle, no! -Don't worry! Play your game! And, don't betray your people! There's Lefty! Oh, you're back! Where were you? Where is Julian? Didn't he come here? No, I thought he would. -I just don't know what to do! -What's wrong? Tell me. Just like I kept a secret for you. Can you keep one for me? Of course... tell me. I'll go see if he's already home. Yes, go... and tell him Lefty's back. Yes. -Is he asleep? -No... he's waiting for you. Well, I'm off. Wake up son, it's time. Oh, Julian... ...that was a long time ago. They were innocent. You stole that money and they ended up in jail. I won't forget that. You're so cynical. Betting on the Wizard. I bet on whomever I please. What shall I do with you, huh? Well, just like in the old days. If you squeal, I'll kill you! What will you do with so much money? What do you want it for? What are you going to buy? I'm going to get out of this damn place. Like I should've done a long time ago. Well then... ...run for it. So, are you going to shoot me? Run and you'll find out. Get going! No, I'm not running. You don't scare me anymore. This time you'll have to kill me and pay for your crime. When they find you... ...I'll be far from here. You want to wear what Ernestina... ...or what Tomas gave you? I guess what Tomas gave me, right? Eulalia is going to feel bad... ...because Tomas bought it from Dora. Well... I'll wear Dora's trousers... ...and Ernestina's shirt and everybody's happy. Cheer up, everything will come out fine. Your uncle will show up. Nothing could have happened to him. You're very strong. Just like your Dad. -It's just that... -Alejandro... ...win or lose... I love you. Let's focus all our energy on Lefty's hand... ...to guide it to victory. Let's visualize what we want to obtain with this victory. Concentrate... ...and charge that image with energy. Tomas! Tomas! -Are you talking to me? -Aren't you Tomas? -May I help you? -And your motorcycle? I sold it... To bet on Lefty. -Then, come with me. -Wherever you say, Miss. -Where's Julian? -He's under arrest. Why is he under arrest? Commander Romo arrested him. -But why? -He took Lefty to the quarry. -He had kidnapped him. -What nonsense! He was also looking for him! -He's not here. -Where is he? I don't know. The Commander arrested him. Where's that bas... commander? I don't know, Tomas! He hasn't reported in. He's very busy now. We must speak to Commander Romo! The problem is that he's not here now. -Oh, no! -We came to report a theft. Of what? Cocoon, they stole the festival's money. -What? -Just what I said. The Wizard! The Wizard! The Wizard! -Commander Romo! -Yes, Miss? We want to know where Julian is. Oh, the guy who wanted to kidnap our champ. Don't be stupid! Hey, hey, I can arrest you too. For disrespect to the authorities. How about that? We are very proud of this boy's talent. I'm going to have an op... operation. Yes, yes, son. I want to do some repairs in the temple, it's falling apart. Oh, so you bet. I caught you. Oh, yeah! My boyfriend, my boyfriend! Of course he's my boyfriend. You're just envious! Me, envious? I almost beat him! Beat him? He always whips you! Stop quarreling, kids. He's my pal. Liar, you were always fighting with him. -What do you know! -Shut up! If he doesn't win, what are we going to do? Don't be so stubborn! I told you he's going to win! Think of the confidence in Lefty. The bets are three to one. -Really? -Yes. Who's that? The stranger. The Wizard's manager. What's going on? We have an issue with them. Don't worry. They'll be right back. Wizard! Wizard! Wizard! What's that child doing there? -Leave her alone. -You're too indulgent! He's going to be our champ. -Where were they? -By the quarry. -Where did they take him? -I don't know. What do you mean? He must be somewhere! -Let's go to the quarry! -I can't leave the office. The commander left me in charge. Besides, I'm not authorized. Please Cocoon, take us! But I have other matters to investigate. I can't leave this place unattended. Either you take us to the quarry... ...or we'll raise a scandal. And the ones charged with... ...kidnapping will be you and your commander. Hello. The lady is Lefty's mother. Ladies and gentlemen... ...let me introduce this evening's contenders! They will face each other in a match never before seen! So he's your son. To my right... ...from Santa Maria... The Wizard! He's 11 years old. To my left... ...from Buenaventura... Lefty! I couldn't tell you because you never showed up. Wizard! Wizard! I didn't show up because I had an accident. Later I looked for you but you had already moved. Wizard! Wizard! Wizard! Wouldn't you prefer the Centennial? No, thanks. The match is about to begin. They will play up to sixty points. Go, go back to your place! Let me see my son! Go! -We need to talk. -Later... later... Wizard! Wizard! Wizard! Lefty! Lefty! Lefty! The Wizard's an ass! Lefty! Lefty! Lefty! Wizard: 00 Lefty: 01 It's yours, Lefty. Yes! Lefty! Lefty! Lefty! It's yours Lefty! Yes, Lefty! Fifteen minute recess. Where are you going? My kids stay with me. -You're doing great! -Did they find my uncle? No, son. But they're looking for him. You're doing great, Lefty! Yes, but I need to go to the bathroom. Let's go, then. Get the hell out of here, snot nose! And I warn you, Lefty... If you're thinking about winning... you'll regret it. Oh, and congratulations. Your game is excellent. Didn't you want to take a leak? I don't feel like it anymore. Lefty! Lefty! Lefty! Julian! Julian! Julian! Do something! Do something! Julian! I don't know what Romo said to you... ...but everybody in here is with you. So shoot a ''Hit and Hand-spread''. Lefty: 59 If he makes that shot... we win. Is he alive? Lefty! Lefty! Lefty! The winner is Lefty! Lefty! Lefty! Lefty! Good, Lefty! This is the hand-spread of a man, murderer! Watch out, Lefty! Let him go, Romo! What's wrong? Why aren't they here? They're coming. He's your dad. How long are you going to stay with your dad? The whole vacation. It will go quickly. Want to play, Lefty? No, thanks. I mean, you could shoot with your right hand, couldn't you? Not as well as with the left. It's a present. Thanks.
