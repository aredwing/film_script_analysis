What's with the kid? - His name's Elliot. He's picking up your slack. Now, look, I need you to find out who took your car and who the fuck has my pills. - Magic wash. - Hmm. Open it. It's pure mdma. - So this what they stole? - Basically. I had it ground down and put in capsules, but.. This is the last shipment for a while. So.. - Who the connect? - That's not any of your concern. - So, I see you trust this nigga chino but you don't trust me. And he the one who need to be handled. - Oh, yeah, like you dealt with that crew on the West Side the other night? - Claimin' territory. - Listen, baby. You're just a dealer on a bike. When chino finds his car and traces down our pills.. We collect. Until then, try making less noise. - Fuck that shit. We need to send a message. - Okay. Look in the glove compartment. - I don't see nothin' in here. - This is how you send a message. Now.. I have some food for you to take home for your mother. Tell her if she needs anything to come to my market stand at 25th street. This is for the wait. - Ting. Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting. Look who decided to come home. Cisco, welcome home. Hungry? No, no, no, you're the fuckin' bank. You guys can extend for as long as you want. I... I just need one more month. Right for as long.. No.. Okay, thank you very much, miss, thank you. Fuck off! Fuck you! Fuck sake! Fuck me. Holy shit, Cisco, I forgot. Look what I've invested in, look at this. Look what I invested in. This is one of those signs that you twirl on the corner. - Ooh, that's like those signs that they have down at the, uh.. Tax places. - Tax places! You're right, t. That's exactly right. So, Cisco. I was thinkin' maybe you and junior can, you know like, stand outside and you know, they... they... they twirl the.. - You paying? - Yeah. For the roof above your head. This place here is keepin' us alive. - Keeping you alive. - I'm all you got. Don't forget that. And I promised your mama I would take care of you. - Don't. Don't talk about my mom. - Yup. - Fuck!

We don't have $150 each. - Sorry, guys. - This is some bullshit. - Name and sponsor? - Hey, we got to skate. There's a whole bunch of sponsors just watching. - I ain't skatin' outside the comp like a bum. - If you guys want, there's an after-party at skatopia. I have extra wristbands. - Damn! - Watch out, bro. - Hey, what the fuck, Patty! Oh, shit. Bro, let's get in! - Yo! - Yo! Yo! Molly? - Molly? - You made all of this tonight? - Yup! - Oh, I don't know how to deal but I'm in, bro, man. I mean, what? I'm with this shit, no question. - Come on, Boobie, don't fuck us, man. You know, it's all or nothing. - What if these dudes come back looking for this stuff, bro? - Then we stop. - And the police? - Bro, they didn't even frisk junior when he got caught. Remember? Come on, man, it's our dream. - To skateboard, bro. Not be drug dealers. - Bro, we're already working cars. Everybody is doing something to get ahead. - That's true, bro. - I don't know one person who hasn't dealt something shady to get what they want. - We can even help our families. - We sell enough until we get into these competitions. And that's it, we stop? - That's it. - Come on, b. - No? - Fuck you, guys. - What? - Chino, chino, got it. Come on, bro. - I never tried Molly. Hey! - What? - I've never fucking tried Molly. If we traffic this shit, let's take it. - Hey, what are y'all dealing now? - We're not dealers, man. - Come on, bro. You came to see me. At my crib, on my day off. Don't keep secrets. Now, that's good quality. - How do you know? - You see the powder on the inside of the capsule? That means it's pure. And then this.. - What? - Hey, yo! - What? - This is momma's shit. - Your mom's? - No, man. This pill. Belongs to momma. Crazy ass lady. Been running game here for years. She's not a joke. - Momma. - Tell us more about the pill. - Well, first of all, you can't be dealing it out of your dirty ass hands. You need to find something to package it in. Something small, something you can get rid of if you need to. - I mean, I know y'all's breath stink, but goddamn. - Yo, this gonna take a minute. There's at least 7000 pills in that bitch. - Then you gotta label the shit. People gotta know it's yours. So you need a signature. You need a logo. - I just cannot draw. That one's garbage. - We ain't gonna throw away pills because they don't look right. - Bro, this one is trash, bro. You're not drawing the Crescent right. - Now it's a party drug. Night clubs, raves, wherever people are having a good time you be there. - Anybody seen my friend, Molly? She's small, she's white, she's very cute. - Ah, that's the new pieces. You see what's up? - Oh, Lebron. - Oh! - Damn, uncle Steve. This makes me wanna slap my momma. - Patty cake, sit your ass down, off the fucking counter. Somebody's gotta fucking clean this place up all the time. - Sit down, fool. - Leave the sign alone. Put it down. - What are we looking at right now? - Uh-huh. Hey, bird. - Yo! - Money, what's up? - Money, bro. - You gotta be kidding. - Money, bro. - Twenty.. - One. One. - Twenty one. - Twenty one, dollars. - Yo, my man. We're about to close. You gotta go. - Where's the rest of it? - I don't know, brother. We get junk from everywhere. - Where's my car, motherfucker? Where is it? - I don't know what you're talking about, man. - Chino! - What's up, man? What's this? You found your car? - What the fuck you doing here? - I was sent. To check in on you, bro. - Why would she send you and your little bitch ass tricycle crew? Stay in line before I fuck you up. Cuidado. - Alright, chino. Let's go. - Here you go, enjoy! Hey, hey, hey, I got dogs on the grill. How many you want? Check this out. Two years, clean and sober, baby. Bam! It's actually, uh, 382 days, 14 hours, 16 minutes but who's counting, right?

You were too young, that's it. You were too young. You're, you are, you were. You don't remember what I did for you.

And then you bring him to my stand? You've no idea where the car... Came from? - No. Kids got it before I put it on the lot. - Who are these kids? - I only know one of them. Cisco.
