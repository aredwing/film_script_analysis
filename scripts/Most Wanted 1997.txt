I don't care. Take him out! I can't. God dammit, Sergeant! We have our orders! Fire! Now! Obey my fucking order! Go! Get your hands off me! You're out of here! These cuffs are tight. Can you loosen them up? My balls are itching. How about you lend me a hand? Careful, convict. I got orders to shoot to kill. Me or yourself? Prisoner transport, south gate. Transfer to death row. Hey, convict, is it true you won a Navy Cross? What did a piece of shit like you do to deserve a medal? I fucked your sister. What are you laughing at? I seen your sister. Fuck you! Fuck you, too! My name is Lieutenant Colonel Grant Casey. I'm with covert ops. Mr. Dunn, you were convicted of killing a superior officer... March 13, 1991. It was self-defense. Sentenced to death. What do you want? I'd like you to work for us. I command a small, elite unit known as Black Sheep. Like you, many of my men are ex-convicts. Take the captain here. When I found him... he was awaiting sentencing in an Iraqi prison... for raping a 15-year-old girl. They don't have sheep in the Middle East? Before you go getting on his bad side... the captain's one of the best assault troops I've ever had. No problem. Now, Mr. Dunn, you listen here... You listen here... I'm not interested in joining anybody's goon squad... so you and George Forehead can just step off. Let's cut the bullshit. You're being transferred to death row today. In 30 days, you will be executed. It doesn't have to be that way. A man of your military background and experience... and the fact you have... no affiliation with the government... makes you an ideal candidate. I can appreciate your concern for the kind of work we do. Terrorism against the citizens of the United States... is at an all-time high. We've been called upon to send a message. I guarantee you that all of our targets... are threats to national security. The choice is up to you. You like some time to think about this? Time's up. You in or out? I'm in. Good to see you. I'm Sergeant Peyton. Glad you could join us. Detail, attention! We have been given a green light. We are a go mission. At ease. Take your seats. What's underneath... is a hideous scar. I seldom remove the cover, for it pains me to remember... that anything could have pierced this perfect body. You gentlemen understand me well. We each have our unsightly wounds... but together, fear not. We shall prove invincible. These extraction packets... are to be used only in dire emergency. Open your powerbooks. Our mission has been designated "Operation Wrath." Our target is Donald Bickhart, occupation: Industrialist. He's been selling biotechnology on the black market... in violation of United Nations referendum 071256. He is targeted for termination. Ten-forty-five a. M... Mr. Bickhart will be escorted by the first lady... to a dedication ceremony of the Bickhart wing... of the Los Angeles Veterans Hospital. When the motorcade arrives... the first lady will exit first, followed by Bickhart. Travel time from L.A.X. To Veterans Hospital... will be approximately 25 minutes. Alpha team... you will take positions on rooftop of building A. Alpha team is in position. Omega, you will take positions on the rooftop of building B. Our operatives in the Secret Service... will provide you the necessary access. In the event you are captured, offer no resistance. We will retrieve you. You will have the kill shot. Here's your ammo. This is ballistic H2O. It's an ice projectile... with a velocity of 3,000 feet per second... and an accuracy of up to 500 yards. No exit wound. The bullet's going to melt inside the target. Ice projectiles. What'll these people think of next? Fruity flavors? Omega in position. It's another gorgeous Southern California day... for the dedication of the Bickhart wing... a newly constructed 100-million-dollar facility... funded by pharmaceutical giant Donald Bickhart. This facility will serve as permanent residence... for some 1,000 disabled war veterans. This has been a pet project of the first lady... the nation's most outspoken advocate for veterans' rights. The motorcade is just arriving. Show time. Omega, wait till target is in the clear. This is Omega. The target is locked. Alpha, this is Omega. There's been a mistake! The first lady's been hit. This is Casey. Go to your extraction point. I'll have to take that. Is there any way I can get it back? Lt'll be returned, Dr. Constantini. Thank you very much. The first lady has just been shot. Is she alive? The NSC has been called for 1:30. They want us in the situations room now. First lady... - Are you damaged? - Who is this? Are you hurt? I want to talk to Casey. Have you spoken to anyone? I want to talk to Casey now. We're going to bring you home. There'll be a car in exactly 60 seconds. They will blow the horn twice. You will come downstairs. Fuck! We have reliable information... our suspect's on the seventh floor in room 712. Taylor, you will lead Blue team. Johnson, you will lead Red team. I want Blue team to make its way to the seventh floor... set up on the door, and make entry. Red team will back up Blue team... and secure the rest of the floor. Let the suspect's actions dictate yours... but remember, he's killed once today already. Son of a bitch. He's below us! Our boy's gone through a pair of double doors... on the second floor. That's 10-David, roger. This dumb shit just sealed himself in. He's in the cafeteria. According to the blueprints, there's only one way in and out. He's all yours. Roger that. Smoke! Team two, move it! Team three, come in! We got a man down in there. We need backup! Backup is on the way! Hold your position and wait for backup! Omega three, you in position? If they bring him out alive, take him. Affirmative. Flash bang it this time before entry. Smoke! We've got a live one here. Base, do you copy? We're sending one down. Copy that. Let's get a paramedic! Let's haul him out! Let's evict this son of a bitch out! Christ! Excuse me. Can you repeat that? He's gone! He's wearing McCarthy's uniform! Dunn is on the street. He's wearing a SWAT uniform. I got him. I lost him! Exit that position. Here's the latest police composite sketch. Run it. Charlie's already on it. I got one. James Anthony Dunn... former marine gunnery sergeant, Persian Gulf. Is he ours? A foot soldier. Convicted of killing his commanding officer... during Desert Storm. Court-martialed, sentenced to death. Escaped 5 days ago while being transferred to Leavenworth. What time did the incident happen? Ten-thirty-two. When was this sketch released? Ten-forty-eight. Somebody is drawing fast. The L.A. Police department has just released... this composite sketch of the suspected assassin. At Veterans Hospital, the atmosphere... utter disbelief. It appears no one except the first lady has been wounded. With me is Victoria Constantini... a doctor at Veterans Hospital and an eyewitness. Can you tell us what you saw? I was videotaping the first lady's arrival... when I heard a shot come from behind me. I turned around, and I thought I saw a man on that roof... but everyone was staring at the other roof. In all the confusion, I might have made a mistake... but I'm pretty sure I saw a man on that roof. We could be talking about multiple shooters. Chief! A bartender swears John Doe is at Sixth and Main. Sixth and Main, people! Let's move! I think we have a problem, Sergeant. Maybe that's all she got. No. There. She changed the tapes before you got to her. Son of a bitch. Fuck! I have a brief statement... which will hopefully answer your questions. We are asking shopkeepers... in the immediate vicinity of the shooting... to examine their surveillance cameras... for sightings of the suspect prior to the shooting. We are also asking citizens who may have taped the event... to allow us to examine those tapes. Simply call your FBI main number... and someone will retrieve the materials. You mean kill your ass. Everybody who witnessed the Kennedy assassination... is dead. If I had a tape, I'd burn it. ...numerous federal agencies joining this manhunt. The military will be taking over the investigation. Fuck it. Shit. City and listing. Los Angeles, FBI, please. The number you requested is area code 310-264-45... Paging Dr. Sean Thompson. Damn! Paging Dr. Bhagavad Nahavarata. Shit! Paging Dr. Gordy, Dr. Jay Gordy. Thank you! I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. Are you OK? I have questionnaires the boys from the 82nd filled out. File them. Someone will do a follow-up someday. Thanks. This is a composite sketch of our suspect. He's armed and extremely dangerous. If you see anyone resembling him... call the police immediately. You guys got any laundry for the basement? Hold that elevator! Thanks. Administration's on the main floor, right? Commander Goldstine? Commander Goldstein. I'm General Adam Woodward... United States Army 82nd division... here by order of the President of the United States. We got office space for you downstairs. How about these? These are my offices. Captain, have the men set up here. Lieutenant Scruggs! You know the drill. Commander Goldstine. All right, people. You heard the general. Hop to it! I want checkpoints and video surveillance. Set them at five-mile intervals throughout the city. Your chopper fleet will be under my command. All eyewitnesses are to be interviewed by my team. Is that understood? Sure. We'll pass that down. What about the press? Up to me, I'd hang them all. You will handle the press. Right. Don't make a sound. Do exactly what I say. Do you understand? Open the door. Let's go inside. You live alone? I have a boyfriend. He's a cop. You don't have a boyfriend. How do you know? There's five empty buckets of Haagen-Dazs in your trash... your legs are stubbly... and your hair color needs a touch-up. You were there. All I want is the tape. It's in my purse. You bastard! What is wrong with you? Next time, try reading the label. Give me the tape. I'm tired of fucking around with you. You see that man? That's the shooter. New information tonight about the suspect... known up to this point only as John Doe. Police have identified the suspected assailant... as James Anthony Dunn. He is an escaped convict. Police have found Dunn's prints on the murder weapon. I was in prison. Let me guess... for murder? What do you think, this is funny? You think this is a joke? I'm just scared. Let's get you some water. Come on. That looks good. I haven't had a piece in five years. Got to have a taste. This is good. You'd be surprised what you miss when you're locked up. What's that smell? It's ammonium nitrate. Where is your dog? I don't have a dog. We got to get out. Move it! Issue a memo to all news stations... reminding them there's a gag order on the media... and if that tape shows, I wish to be first to see it. Why are they trying to kill me? They're just tying up loose ends. They must have seen you on TV. Why are you stopping? There's a roadblock. Turn around. I can't. You never saw me. I never saw you. We're looking for this man. Have you seen him? He was in my car. He tried to kidnap me. He got out over there. Dunn was in this lady's car! Sergeant, run those plates. Never saw me? Drive. Patrol one and two, come in. This is patrol one. Patrol two. Go ahead, command. Suspect has been spotted at checkpoint one. Suspect vehicle is a champagne-colored Volvo... California license plate 2-Sierra-Alpha-Mike-5-6-4. Slow down. Turn off your lights. Stop. Just go straight. Follow the riverbed. The car belongs to Victoria Constantini. That's impossible. She's supposed to be dead. Supposed to be dead? Your orders are to get that videotape. I couldn't find the tape, so I thought... You thought? You're not to think. You're to follow orders. And because you did not... an innocent civilian may be dead. We're not killers. We are soldiers. The only time you will kill is if given an order to kill. Is that understood? We have a witness that refuses to sign a statement. What do we do with him? Kill him. Patrol one and two, what's your status? Negative. Nothing. You have him boxed in. You should have a visual. Captain Braddock, how's the fishing in the L.A. River? I understand. Marines train their troops well. Chopper one, drag the riverbed. Turn off the lights. Wait here. Asshole. Nine-one-one. May I help you? What are you doing? Give me that! - Just don't kill me. - Have I hurt you? You bring me to the middle of nowhere... I saved your life. I'm sick of this. Get out. You want to do this by yourself? Go! I'm sure they'll use a smaller bomb next time. Thought so. They searched the riverbed and found some tire marks. They did not recover a vehicle. I'll set up a perimeter, start a door-to-door search. Wake up all those nice people? I have a better way to flush him out. You can call our friend, tell him I'm about to come over. What is this place? An old marine base. Did my sniper training here. It was closed down after the budget cuts. Let me have that. Stand over there. This place is filthy. Are there any rats here? I hope so. We might get hungry. Where's your telephone? - In my bag. - I'll get it. Wouldn't want another Charlie's Angels flashback. It was a gift from my mother. She thinks every psycho in L.A. Is coming after me. Who knew? Let me know when 30 seconds pass. Your private line. Rackmill. This is Omega. This is Deputy Director Rackmill of the CIA. I'm not laughing, funnyman. Who is this? CIA? Twenty seconds. Where did you get this number? They said it was a government-sanctioned hit. James Dunn. - Trace it. - You're in trouble. The first lady was not supposed to be the target. - Ten seconds. - I'm gone. Wait a minute. We didn't kill the first lady, either. How'd you get my private number? My C.O. Casey. Unit was Black Sheep. Five seconds. Where are you? I can't help you if I can't find you. I'll find you. Did you get it? He hung up under the wire. What did you find out? I'm not sure. Charlie, run James Dunn through intel. What branch? CIA. - What? - Do it. What about that Black Sheep bullshit? What is this, kung pao chicken? - Want some? - A little later. It's not exactly bullshit. Black Sheep was a covert strike team... we used to run until Congress shut us down in '81. - Whoa! - What? Black Sheep's been reactivated. Or someone wants to make it look that way. Who's running it? Lieutenant Colonel Grant Casey, covert ops. Died in Vietnam 30 years ago. What is going on? Haven't you ever been framed? Framed? Do the math. A former marine sniper assassinates the first lady. Fifteen minutes later, they've I.D.'d the shooter. Fifteen minutes after that, they've got him trapped. Twenty-four hours later, he calls here... claiming to be a member of one of our units... wondering why he's not a hero. This guy's been set up... and so have we. Who do you think it is? Somebody very smart. That's enough. Chop-chop. Good night, Niki. You wanted to see me? Don't even offer a man a drink? Where's your sense of hospitality, Mr. Bickhart? - What's your pleasure? - Johnnie Walker. Get her out of here! Out of the pool! This wasn't the plan. Nothing to worry about. The manhunt's been handed over to me. I will apprehend him within 48 hours. I'm worried somebody else will get to him first. The FBI, the police. What if he talks? Let him. Everything he thinks he knows leads to someone else. And the press? We can't afford to have them poking around. That's how we got here in the first place. What got us here... is that you helped put a man into office... whose wife was a bleeding-heart liberal. Not only that, son of a bitch is so weak... can't even keep her from wearing the pants. It doesn't bother you at all, does it? We killed that woman. I agree. There are some concerns. There's a lot of do-gooders might want to help Dunn... if he can convince them of his innocence. I have a way of taking care of that. It's going to require more participation on your part. What do you mean? We need to keep the public focused. On what? Money. A little bit more of your money. Bonnie Ann Hartfield was a friend and great humanitarian. We shared many charitable causes... none more worthy than caring for the veterans of this country. I was with the first lady at the time of the shooting. I feel an obligation to do everything I can... to bring her killer to justice. I am offering $10 million to any citizen... who captures or provides information... leading to the capture of James Dunn. Barnes here. There's another shooter. I got it on tape. Who is this? L.A. Reservoir, 20 minutes. No cops, no cameras. Roger? Why aren't you on your way downtown? You got to get someone else to cover for me. I got a call from a guy claims there's another shooter. He's got it on tape. Go. They yanked our clearances, sealed our files... took away our access codes. Someone is trying to stick it to us. There are rumors flying all over Washington. I know. You seem calm about it. I'm paid to be calm. Besides, it can be fun. You can go years without a good chess game. I can't look at another satellite photo. I have the solution. Really? We eliminate Dunn ourselves. That's our final option. We need him to help flush out the mole. You think it's someone inside? I know it is. The only person who could know our secrets that well is a mole. Don't turn around. Just start walking. Relax. If I were going to kill you, you'd already be dead. I didn't kill the first lady. I was there, but I didn't pull that trigger. You were right. There was another shooter. Why was she assassinated? Murdered. The first lady's politics means nothing. Her agenda is social. She has no military powers... nor does she shape foreign policy. Whatever reason she was killed, it was personal. To who? I don't know, but if I don't find out... it's just a matter of time before I wind up... like every other lone assassin. You covered the first lady. Did she have any enemies? She wasn't the most popular first lady, but nothing extreme. Can you think of anything in her past... something that could have come back to haunt her? She led a pretty straight life. Up until the White House, she was an ACLU attorney. Was she working on anything? Veterans' rights. That was her main focus. Her biggest flaw was her passion. I don't know. I can't think of anything. Here's the tape. Get it on the air. Maybe people will start asking questions. You got it. It's Dunn! James Dunn! You're cooked for 10 million. It's him! Sorry. It's the guy who shot the first lady! Get him! Stop him! Ten-million-dollar man! Y'all can run for 10 million. Look out! What are you, somebody famous? You could say that. People tell me I look like Denzel Washington. What do you think? Roger, I met him face-to-face. Who is it you met? Elvis. Who are you? Who am I? I'm goddamn General Woodward. I'm heading this investigation. I understand you have evidence you wish to present to me. Is that right? What's this guy's story? Steve, give him the tape. Bullshit. This is a matter of national security. They have the right to see everything before we view it. Give them the tape. Son. Wasn't too hard, was it? We have a suspect in custody. Get my chopper ready. What do you know about that? What? Seems Elvis left the building. Make a hole. Get him up so the general can see his face. Freeze! Don't shoot. It's me. What happened to you? I got stuck in traffic. I've added the muzzle flash... and I reversed the action to create recoil... I do not give a shit about technology. All I care about is if you can deliver this within one hour. Can you do that? Do that. This might sting. Were you really in jail before all this? For killing someone? Five years ago... I was a marine specialist in Iraq. I was a sniper. I was given a target package. I was told it was a courier. When the courier showed up, it was a 10-year-old boy. I refused the order. My C.O. Freaked out... pulled his sidearm, put it to my head. We wrestled, gun went off. That's how I wound up in jail. Sounds like self-defense. Here we go. In this video, you see Dunn firing that fatal shot... that was captured on home video by a spectator. What happened to the tape? The military... they were waiting for me. They took it. They said it was phony. You gave it to them? I'm sorry. That tape was our only chance. We'll have to figure it out on our own. We just have to solve a political assassination. Just think. They killed her at the hospital for a reason. Was there anything out of the ordinary there? It wasn't really out of the ordinary. What? The first lady was supposed to stay for one day. They added another one to meet a bunch of soldiers. I thought it was a feel-good thing... but then they said they wanted to videotape. Videotape what? Some of the guys from the 82nd... a bunch of soldiers with weird neurological disorders... tremors, nonspecific paresthesia. They all had the same thing? Keep your eye on that security guard. What are you looking up? It's called Westlaw. It's a legal research database. Every published lawsuit is on-line. What good's that going to do? The first lady was a lawyer with the ACLU. They take on pretty heavy people... class actions, shit like that. Question: What does a lawyer use videotape for? Depositions? The first lady's pet project? Veterans' rights. What does it say? According to this, a soldier named Flemming... sued the army for using a vaccine on him... an experimental vaccine... C.R.C. -13. It was given to every man in his unit. What was his unit? Eighty-second airborne. Get the car. I'll meet you out back. I know who you are. I seen you on TV. You're that guy. Can I have your autograph? I never miss your show. Big fan. Thanks, Montel. I'd like to see the records on patient Lee Flemming. We don't have any records on file. Try the national database. He would have been with the 82nd division. That's strange. No medical records for the 82nd are available. Thanks. I want you to do me a favor. Run a patent search on a vaccine... C.R.C. -13. Call me at this number when you get something. Here's those questionnaires you wanted. Thank you, Randy. You're welcome. You let the most-wanted man in America use a computer... knowing full well his identity? Is that right? I'm just a security guard, man. Man? You're a disgrace! A goddamn disgrace. He's putting things together. Of course he is. He'd be an idiot not to... all the help he's provided with. Get this man out of my sight. Traitor. Ought to take him out and shoot him... man. This is what he's got. What's that still doing there? What is it doing in there? It's not supposed to be in there. It's supposed to be gone! Goddamn incompetence! This is interesting. Flemming never went to the Persian Gulf. He was discharged before the invasion. Whatever these soldiers were exposed to... had to be stateside. C.R.C. -13. Thanks a lot. That was the hospital. I had a friend run a patent search on C.R.C. -13. The patent was registered to Bickhart Pharmaceuticals... bioweapons division. If you spent as much money on security as cigars... you'd live longer. Your dogs are underfed. Half-pound of steak, and they're man's best friend. Your men would take less naps... if you put them on 8-hour shifts instead of 12. This alarm system is totally outdated. Gum and a screwdriver is all you need. What do you want? You need to check that attitude. Don't let the fact I haven't put a bullet in your ass... give you a false sense of security. The reason you still breathe is you have information I need. What is Colonel Casey's real name? I don't know what you're talking about. Then die. Wait. Name! What is his name? Woodward... General Adam Woodward. I know who killed her. I'm listening. It was General Adam Woodward. He's working with Donald Bickhart. Woodward? The same one heading the investigation? Woodward allowed Bickhart... to try an experimental vaccine on his troops. It was supposed to protect them from viral warfare... only the vaccine was contaminated. The troops started dying. The first lady was going to expose the whole thing. Do you have proof? You said you'd help me. You going to bring me in? You want my help? Get the files. Only then will I bring you in. Accusation without confirmation is meaningless. Anything that damaging, Woodward will keep close. You're going to have to get next to him. Is that clear? Are they going to help us? What are we going to do? We're going to split up. What are you talking about? I appreciate all your help, but I got to do it from here. Take this. Go back to the bunker, turn on the TV... and wait for my signal. - What signal? - You'll know. When you see it, I want you to call that number. Somebody will pick you up. What are you going to do? What they trained me to do. Pull over. I hope I see you again. Count on it. You know what? I don't think he did it. They got film on the boy. Film don't mean shit. A nigger can't get from Crenshaw to La Brea... without police stopping him at least twice. He shot the president's wife? Tell me he shot the mayor of Compton's wife... and I'll believe you. Don't start nothin'. Ain't gonna be no problem. Sergeant Fury was upset, wasn't he? Keep going. Single file. Task force. This is Sergeant Fury in lockup. We got a guy I think is a definite match. He's demanding to speak to a lawyer. Tell the general to take a look. We'll tell him. Officer! I'm talking to you! Shoot him! Jam that thing! They're going up. Call downstairs. Shut off the power in those elevators. This entire building will be sealed in one minute. You just dug your grave. I was dead when you met me. Tell me something. How does a man of the United States Army... do what you did to those men? The price of freedom is high. What happened was a necessary evil... friendly fire. Hear them coming? They're coming for you. You sick son of a bitch. I should bust a cap in your chitlin-eatin' ass now. You're lucky I didn't come here for that. I'm going to bury you. You've got nothing! You can't access that powerbook without the proper key. - You think I'm an imbecile? - Where's the key? In the safest place in this man's universe. You ain't never gonna find it, jar-head. Give me the key, or I'll blow your brains out! You got the guts? Pull the trigger! The key dies with me! You're trying my patience. Tell me something. Why does a man so proud of his wounds hide the scar? Safest place in God's universe? I'll have your head on my trophy wall! You know something? You talk too much. I want the blueprints for this building! Cover the stairs! All the exits! Move it! He's headed for the roof! Get a chopper up there! Don't shoot him. The son of a bitch is mine. Make a hole! Hold your fire! Get your ass up on the deck! Sorry about that knot on your head. The swelling's going to make it hard... for you to stick it up the general's ass. Fuck you! Should have killed me while you had the chance. Piss-poor planning on your part. I'm a marine. We don't plan. We improvise. Throw us the bag! Bomb! He's hit. He's down in the alley! I want every swinging dick down there! Pull the noose tight and drop him like a bad habit. This man dies tonight. This way! You're mine now, bitch! Where you going? You ain't going nowhere. The pain! The beautiful pain! Did that hurt? Stop crying like a girl! You're not a warrior. That's why we chose you. You're nothing but a pansy! I'm the warrior! Now you're a dickless warrior. Get me up. Get me out of here. There's been a fiery explosion... at downtown's Police Plaza building. Unconfirmed reports place James Dunn at the scene. Police and army units are in pursuit. Do you know me? Get out! Everybody! Get out of here! He's on the line. Rackmill. I got the files. Where are you? It doesn't matter. There's one witness left. Her name is Victoria Constantini. I want your word you'll protect her. We've already heard from her. I want your word. You have my word. What about the files? They belong to the American people now. Whatever you are thinking of doing, don't do it. You have no idea what's at stake here. - Tell me you got him. - We got him. I want a team there now. A chopper's on the way. Got it. We're on our way. Dunn's been spotted downtown at the central market. Freeze! - This is Rackmill. - We've got him. That's good. Keep him on ice. I'll get back to you. We got him. Thank you for a wonderful evening's work. Go home and get some rest. Spencer, take a walk with me, will you? What is it? Call Woodward and tell him I want to be his new partner. Excuse me? I don't understand. That's pretty good... that innocent schoolboy thing. A little overplayed, maybe. Young, fair-haired boy wants to learn from the old master. Undying loyalty. Clumsy enthusiasm. John... I read your file. You have never been clumsy. Seventeen encrypted phone calls from L.A. To the Pentagon... all from your office. I still have friends in the agency. You don't want to do that. Ruin your whole life for some cowboy stunt? That's better. This is business. You have just been turned. I know it's hard... but it happens to people like us all the time... and it's eminently survivable. Everything is the same, except now you work for me. Do you understand that? Now you can make your phone call. How could that happen? Somebody else got him. He got past this grid? How did you let anyone past this grid? It's Spencer. The CIA has him. Good work, Spencer. Not really, Adam. Who the hell is this? Ken Rackmill. Hello, Ken. Been a long time. Let's get down to nut-cutting. You remember Hiroshima? That was birthday candles on a cake... compared to what will happen if what you have comes to light. Since I know all your dark secrets as well... maybe we can do a little horse-trading. I'm listening. I want Dunn. What can I do to put a smile on your face? I understand there's a reward for the capture of Mr. Dunn... ten million. Since I have him in my custody... I should be entitled to half. We understand each other. I'll get back to you. Good. We're about to be redeemed. Five million dollars for Dunn and the files? Who does this son of a bitch think he is... that he can blackmail us? Captain Braddock has gotten here before us. He's taken a shooter's position. Once Dunn and the files are delivered... Braddock will take out Rackmill. This one had better work. Try to keep your panties dry. Kenny. Adam. Donald Bickhart, Kenny Rackmill. As you see, I've lived up to my part of the bargain. Where are the files? Let me see the money. Would you like to count it? I'm sure you already have. Then we're done. Not quite. There's one little detail. What might that be? Just killing Dunn will not solve your problems. How is that? A patsy is no good without a trail to someone. I think the idea that Dunn was hired by a rich person... to kill the first lady... to cover up that he was using American soldiers... to test a viral weapons agent is a very good scenario. Don't you think so? What is he talking about? The press will fall in love with it... and the folks in Washington are going to buy it. What's going on? And, General, you're going to be a hero. Take him out. Take your cut. Good doing business with you. Of course, we're fair men. If we're collecting the reward... we're going to deliver the fugitive to justice. Absolutely. Alive or dead? Be a pity to bring a live rattlesnake forth... and endanger the innocent. Let the honor be mine. Improvise this, asshole. Payback's a bitch, ain't it? Sometimes I plan shit. The focus shifted to Washington, D.C., today... for the funeral of General Adam Woodward. General Woodward was declared a hero... after he was killed uncovering the conspiracy... to murder the first lady. Woodward found out... Congressional hearings open today... in the case of Bickhart pharmaceuticals... and its secret human test of the vaccine C.R.C. -13. The case was pushed into public view... by Dr. Victoria Constantini, whose testimony is crucial... because of her early treatment... of the veterans involved in the illegal research. Donald Bickhart committed suicide... after he was linked with assassin Alan Braddock... in the plot to kill the first lady. In an ironic twist, escaped convict James Dunn... the apparent fall guy of the conspirators... was returned to military prison last month. His final appeal was recently denied. His long delayed execution was carried out last night. I'm Christine Devine. Back to you in the newsroom. Wow. You look just like that guy.
