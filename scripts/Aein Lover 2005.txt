And the apple that was stuck in her throat fell off. I like worn and old things. They make me comfortable. You're romantic. What do you know? You're young. You know my age? A year younger than me. - How old are you? - a year older than you. You're good. The limbs cut off with blood splashing everywhere... - I hate scary movies. - But reality is scarier.

You can call me that, too. What's wrong? - You okay? - I'm fine. What's wrong with me? - You sure you're okay? - Yes. It's the cold water. Cold drinks make me cough. Didn't you say you had to leave before six? What should we do till then? What should we do? What do you wanna do? Toy with me, will you? - Why do You want that? - I just do. Please, toy with me. - In any way? - In any way! Come on, you can do better. Yes! That's it! What are you doing? Come on. Where are you going? Come back! Get me down! How could you do that? - It was so funny. - Stop laughing. I'm sorry. - Let me see. - Don't touch it. It's okay. You asked me why I wanted to buy you drinks, right? It was your ankles. I wanted to touch them. I knew you'd say that. Let go. Hold still. Stop it. What if someone sees us? Who cares? We're so lewd. We're not. We're just crazy. My Love Hop in. What's wrong? Anything happened? Won't you answer it? No. Get me a cigarette from in there, will you? Who's this? Put it back in. - She's pretty. - Put It back in. A girlfriend? A wife? Get me a cigarette, will you? Where can I drop you off? You know what? Never mind. What if I miss you? You're leaving tomorrow. I am. But I'm not going there to die. I'm going. Bye. You're cool. - Be happy there. - I will. You, too. I'll wait here. I'll allow you to wait for me for 30 minutes. I don't know if you're worthy. Forget it then. I might not come back. Come. I'll be at that park. Even if I don't come back, don't hate me, okay? Wanna listen to it? I like this song, too. Yeah? I'll spend the night here. It'll be better than sleeping, looking at the ceiling. Not many stars these days. But it's still the sky. - Come with me. - Where? You told me to toy with you. - How? - You'll find out. - Until ten o'clock, okay? - That's it? That's enough. I have to get up early in the morning. Here. - Yes, or no? - Yes! Shoot him! - Where? - Right there. - He's the boss! - Let me. This is so much fun. Let's do it again. I told you to step on this. It lets you load your gun. Okay! Stop yelling at me. Put the coins in. I wanna do it. Not this. Who's she? Who? That girl in the picture. - Don't eat the burnt pieces. - Tell me. No personal questions, remember? Oh brother... Fine, I'll tell you. Okay? I almost married her. She was an intern at our company while going to grad school. We dated for three years. I was ready to propose. But she hooked up with my friend. - your friend? - Yes. You know what's really funny? She married someone else. That's what we call love. It's a mess. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Do you have any other cards? - Why? - It's maxed out. You haven't gotten over her? I have. Why carry her picture then? Because it's so sad how fast we forget. I was in love for three years. And I felt as if I'd even forget what she looked like. Isn't that sad? Let's turn the table. - Ask me. - are You married? - That's a foul. - You started it. - Next question. What if you meet your destined man right before the wedding? I'd hit him. His butt first, then his face. I'd kick his leg and swear at him. Then I'd ignore him. What would you do? I don't know. What kind of answer is that? I'd offer to buy her drinks if it's just us until we reach B3. I thought you couldn't handle cold stuff. Liquor is fine. Sorry, but this card has been canceled. That can't be right. I don't have any... Here. - time goes by so fast. - Yes. What about your car? My friend will pick it up. I've promised to give it to him. Can you do me a favor? What is it? Let me hit you. Then you'd ignore me? - Where? - Anywhere I want to. You want to? Go ahead. Can you hit me for a few more hours? Are you okay? Let me see. - I'm okay - You sure? I'm so sorry. Let me see. Hold still for a second. I have to go now. Don't do this. We had an agreement. Why are you still here? You're eating your words. I'm just standing here. - Go. - You go first. No. Do what you like. We've decided to make it simple. I mean, we've dated for seven years. That sounds good. It's next month. I'll send you the invitation. Okay, thanks. What's up with your clothes? They're comfortable. What's going on? You stood us up. I had a hard time coming up with an excuse for you. Did you drink? That's fine. You know, I understand. They say girls go through that before the wedding. But don't be too obvious. We're busy on Saturday. Mr. Kim's daughter is having a concert. I'll ask him to marry us. Should we do it? I was thinking. Can we put it off? Don't make me lose it. What's up with the traffic! Marriage is nothing. Don't be too serious. Okay? Aren't you sick of me? Every girl becomes the same after seven years. What's the matter? Let it go, okay? I'll live with you. And you will, too. What's love? This is love, too. Got it? I don't know. What the hell did I do wrong? Everybody lives in his own hell. Why should I be your hell? You can dump me. I would do that if I could get out of hell by dumping you. Can you leave me? For seven years hell has expanded as much as our love has. Everybody knows it's hell, but he can't get out of it. That's hell. Don't you wanna know who I drank with? I drank with a guy. Moron! You... That was out of line. It was you who started it. Make me happy. I feel like shit now. I'm hot. Don't. - Don't answer it. - Give It here. Why'd you call? If it makes you happy, I'm okay with it. I'll let you have fun tonight. Everybody wants a fling every now and then. I'll understand. You're coming back to me. Nothing will change. Have fun. Be good to my girl. To her, you're nothing but a disposable dildo. I like you being aggressive. It turns me on. It's me. Me? I'm having fun. As you told me to. You think you're something? You like fucking me? Is it fun for you? Not for me. It sucks! You were thinking about him while sleeping me? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend? Whatever you want him to be. What, he doesn't go down on you? You're no different. Who do you think you are? It's my body, not yours! What are you doing? Move! - Get out of my way! Let go! - Don't play with me! Cool it! Let me go! Let me go! You look horrible. You're an asshole! What'd I do wrong? You don't know? Tell me. You're really leaving tomorrow? - What? - Guys say that when they just want some fun without taking on the responsibility. It was your line, wasn't it? Stop toying with me. Not any more. It was you who was toying with me. Why'd you do that? Screw you! Let go! Give me your hand. Why? What are you doing? When I miss you, I'll come here and touch it. You're so silly. You're leaving tomorrow. I might come back. When I start forgetting your face. I'm scared... to forget you. Should I sing for you? We're here to wed Mr. Boy and Ms. Girl in holy matrimony. First, there will be the bow. Bride and groom, bow. Stop laughing. Next are the wedding vows. Will you, Mr. Boy make love to her before she frets... Come on, do it right. And swear to love her until her hair turns gray? - No. - What? Will you, Ms. Girl swear not to hit him in any circumstances, and love him with all your heart until his hair turns gray? No! Here, they swore to stay married for the rest of their lives. What? We both said no. With the authority invested in me, I declare them to be married. Now, they'll exchange rings. What rings? Well, the bride already has a ring on. So we'll skip it. Now they will kiss, promising to each other solemnly that they'll never be as happy as they are now. Come on. Now, the bride and groom will bow to the guests. Bride and groom, turn right. Bow to the guests. March! - Where are We going? - On our honeymoon! I haven't been here for ages. Me neither, though I always drove by. You know what? When a couple is in love... When they really love each other... They're better off, remaining as lovers. As everlasting lovers. Hi. We just got married. - We married ourselves. - I see. - No guests, just us. - is that so? I'm broke now. I'll pay. Can you give this to us as a wedding gift? We'll be grateful. You must be something. This beautiful lady married you, even though you're broke. I know. It's on the house. Get rich and be happy. Thanks. You're such a player. She saw my sincerity. - Did You enjoy our honeymoon? - Yes. - Let's go home now. - Home? - Yes, to our place. - What do You mean? Let's go. Pick one. - For real? - Yes, I bought them all. You must be wealthy. Okay, I'll pick one. Innie minni miny mo. Catch a tiger by his toe. If he hollers, let him go. Innie minni miny mo. - That one! - Okay, let's go. Wait! You should carry me in. So nice. Look at that bed. - You like it? - Yeah, it's just my style. I love it. So cushiony. I thought you were rustic. You do have good taste in furniture. I love the kitchen. It makes me feel like cooking. Is the fridge too big? No, I like it. It's big enough. What's this? It's empty. You don't have to cook. - We'll eat out everyday. - How nice. You should make lots of money. Let's make it romantic. Done. What do you think? You're so handsome. - Come here. - What? It tickles. I'm writing something for you. Guess what it is. You have three shots. If you fail, I'll erase it. Not a weird word, right? Okay, take a guess. What is it? What'd you write? Flutter, flutter. I'm so happy with you. As if we were on the moon. What am I then? A rabbit. A rabbit? I'll spill it. It tickles. You don't wanna be a rabbit? Let's tell each other stories. I'm not in the mood. In elementary school, this girl had a pencil sharpener. Our pencils were stubby but hers were sharp and pointy. Everybody was envious. One day, she offered to sharpen my pencils. I was so happy. But you know what? Those pencils' lead broke so easily. I missed the ones that my mom sharpened. They were stubby but soft. Just like you. You're stubby but soft. I'll miss you. Don't you wanna do it? We don't have to do it anymore. Sorry about last night. Call me when you get up. Sending message to: My Love Slept well? We should go. Sure. We should go. It's cold. Wait. - a glass Of warm water, please. - Okay. Thanks. It's warm. Go ahead. It looks good. Should I not leave? Why don't we go out? What do you say? Let's not. You'll be free with me. You can come and go anytime you want to. I don't care about myself. We had sex the whole day. Say, we go out for a week, or a month. Then what? I know little about you. What do you know about me? Am I supposed to? I'll start learning about you. I'd like to remember you as of this moment. If we go out, we'll start finding faults with each other. We'll be disappointed and regret it. Isn't that how it works? You don't know what might happen. Don't jump to conclusions. Do you have a girl? who you like so much that you wanna hide her? I'd like to have good memories about a man. One that I like so much that I would want to hide. One that I can recall upon death as the man who brought me happiness. How about you? That's how I want to be remembered by you. You're really bad. Yes. I'm a bad girl. You made a mistake earlier. Had you not gotten me warm water I might have decided to go out with you. This stew is really good. Isn't it? What will you do right after you get off the plane? Well... I might be checking the number of the flight attendant's. That's so you. You know what my wish is? To be happy. Are you happy today? No. You? Me neither. Don't get old. Why not? When I run into you, I'll hit on you. Stay as pretty as you are. You'll grow old handsomely. Give me your hand. It's just like you. It couldn't be woven any more tightly. It's pretty. One knotted with devotion shouldn't untie easily. But no matter how hard you tie it there's always room. Need taxi fare? It's okay. I'll walk. Okay then. Want some coffee? Good-bye. That's great. Try to look more natural. That's good. Miss, give yourself a big smile. Okay. Here we go. Okay, that was great. We'll move to a different spot. Give the bride a different bouquet. Okay You look gorgeous. So pretty. It's a perfect day for a wedding shoot. Miss? Miss?
