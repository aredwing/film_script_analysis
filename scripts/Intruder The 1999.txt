You're admitting that you killed Stella Girard, former wife of your husband Nick Girard, with this gun. Yes. God, I've told you a dozen times. Yes, I killed Stella just a few hours ago in our apartment. The problem is that Stella Girard was indeed killed, but not a few hours ago. - Two years ago! - I can explain that. Who could predict that an obsession could ruin so many lives? I can't explain it to myself. How can I make others believe it? They're trying to tell me it happened 2 years ago. All I know is what happened a few hours ago. I was there, I saw the body. I wanted to make things clear. Was there an end? Or even a beginning? The first Mrs. Girard was killed in this city over 2 years ago with this weapon, and this weapon was found in the possession of your client. When I arrived from Europe just over a year ago, I knew no one. All my friends, my family, I left behind me. I felt a new kind of freedom. Sorry. No, I'm sorry. Hi. Hi. My name is Nick. - Catherine. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - Enjoy. - Yeah, I will. Help! My bag! Are you all right? Yeah. Careful, you might have broken something. It's okay. It's just my ankle. - You think you can walk? - Just about, I think. Shit, my keys! My God. Everything was in my bag. I live right above the gallery. Why don't we just go upstairs see if we can't sort this thing out. Okay? Okay. Yeah. Real easy. Here. Lie back here. Put your foot up. Okay. Yeah? I have a very friendly doctor, lives just down the block. I'll ask him to come over, okay? Okay, thank you. You're really kind. You want some tea? Yeah, I'd love some tea. Do you have chamomile? Yeah, I think I do. Here you go. Thank you. Careful, it's hot. Do you live here alone? Yeah, now I do. Must be Doctor Nutting. Are you under any other kind of medication? For migraines. I take very strong pills. You're gonna be just fine. Don't go to work for a few days. Stay in. Read a good book. What do you recommend? Something relaxing. No violence. - So what's the verdict, doc? - No bones broken, but she should stay off her feet. - Understandable. - She your girlfriend? - No. - We'll, she's a bit shook up. Might be a good idea if she... If she stayed here. It'd be good if she didn't move around tonight. Painkillers. They should help. Are you all right? Yeah. It's a bit embarrassing. - It's okay. - I need to go to the bathroom. The bathroom. Yeah, that's okay, it's not embarrassing. Just over here. Where are you from? Where's your accent from? - I'm French. - Yeah? Yeah. And you? Me? I was born here. I'm really embarrassed. Okay, here we go. Here. There we go. - I can manage the rest. - Right, right. If you need something, just shout. Thank you, nurse. God, I feel so bloody feeble. You ought to after what you've been through. Could I get you something to drink? Could I have another chamomile tea? I'm afraid you had the last one. But I do have some Earl Grey. Okay. Here you go. - Thanks. - That should keep you nice and warm. You were married, weren't you? Yeah, how did you know? Just a guess. A good guess. Yeah, I was married. She died. I'm sorry. Her name was Stella. And she also liked chamomile tea. - You need rest. See you tomorrow. - Okay. What are you doing? I'm going back to my place. The doctor said specifically that you weren't to move. I'll go get your prescription filled. You've been wonderful, really. But I ought to go home. Give me one good reason why you have to go home right now. Rosebud. I can't leave Rosebud. Who's Rosebud? My cat. Do you have to work this afternoon? Yeah, I've got about two or three more hours to do. But it can wait. What have you got in mind? I didn't tell you. There's a new trio down at the Jazz Club. You wanna hear some music tonight? Yeah? We can have dinner down there, maybe go to Antonio's first? Okay. - You'd like that? - Yes. - Almost ready? - Yeah, getting there. We gotta go, Badge is waiting. I know. Nick, I'm almost ready. - Did you bring my dress up? - Yeah, it's on the bed. Oh my God! - Who did this? - How did that happen? I have no idea. Well, put on whatever you want. You look great in whatever. I'm gonna go on down, okay? We don't want to upset the famous Badge, do we? Please don't worry about this tonight. You don't care about my dress. There must be some explanation. It's open. Hey, welcome back. How was Europe? - Good. - Yeah? - Hi. - You look great. Hi. No. No. We can't do this. Things are different. It's never stopped you before. Hey, come in! - Catherine! - Hi. - I'm Badge Mller. - Hi. Sorry I'm late. I had a problem with my dress. You look beautiful. You're not late, no one's here yet. - Wanna drink? - Yeah. To the three of us. Yeah. - Cheers. - Cheers. What do you think of it? It's my latest acquisition. - Klaus Marton. - You know his work? Well, only in reproductions. Nick tells me you worked in the Bartel Gallery in Paris. I was just an assistant really. Delicious. What did she mean "delicious"? I'm not a cake. That's just her way of saying she likes you. What was she saying to you at the door? Nothing, really, just about her trip to Europe. - You looked uncomfortable. - Yeah? No, I was fine. Did I tell you? She's part of a German banking family. Should I be impressed? I'm just saying she's a very sharp woman. I've seen her sell a painting back to the artist. - Hey, Charlie! - Hi. - How are you? - Good. - Hi. - Hi, I like you dress. I brought - some friends. - Hi. - I'll get some wine. - They're twins. They work for a magician friend of mine, they're part of his act. I see them as an installation piece. Is that how you see me? No, I see you as... a nude wearing a dress. I guess that's accurate. You behave! Here's Daisy. Fashionably late as usual. What's all this? - I don't know, I rolled too many. - Lose a mogul? Skiing mogul, wise guy. Last run of the day. Hi! I've drunk too much. Can you tell? Yes. What would you have, Daisy? Badge is into "Chateau du St. Cosme". "Chateau de Saint-Cme." Only the best for old friends. Not another power cut! We live in a great city like this and we can't get the electricity right. It's this building. It's got a mind of it's own. That maintenance man, he's always fiddling with things. It doesn't bother me, I've got my own generator. Can't afford a computer... crash. - I have to go to the bathroom. - Yes, I know. I'll help you. Don't throw up before we get there. It won't come. - Why get yourself in such a state? - Men. It still won't come. Put your fingers down your throat. Oh, I can't. I'll get you some black coffee. Yuk! Okay, then. I'll see if there's something in... here. What do you think of the famous Badge? I'm not sure. I haven't quite figured her out yet. Don't worry, you will. Oh, God, I feel so lousy. - Why don't you stay with us tonight? - No. I'll find my way. I'll get home somehow. You'll do as you're told. I usually do. Daisy's staying with us tonight. Oh, yeah? Just don't snore. Wise guy. Interesting, isn't it? - It's from the Congo? - That's right. I think it looks kind of nasty. Yeah, it does. It's one of the most powerful pieces of African art. I kind of like it. Borrow it for a while. You could use some more art. Well that's very kind, but... He's a hunter, Catherine. He hunts wrongdoers and people who cause sickness and unhappiness. He'll protect you. Then we'll take him. Interesting how he was made for practical reasons and now he's art. Who's that? Let's go to bed. Don't rush me. Waiting makes it more exciting. We'll wake Daisy. So? We'll wake Daisy. What do you say we give her a reason to be very, very... jealous. Come here. Daisy. I'm sorry - we woke you. - Woke me? Bout three in the morning. Catherine, I slept like a baby all night soon as my head hit the pillow. I was so out of it. What's with you and Charlie? Don't you like him? He's not really my type. I thought he would be your type. I know he doesn't care about money, but... he did make millions inventing a computer game. Yeah, well he's still got a chip for a brain. Daisy, I meant to ask you something. Go ahead. It's about Nick and Stella. What was she really like? Oh, God, Catherine, don't ask me. I mean I hardly knew her. Ask Nick. No, Nick won't talk about her. Charlie's lived upstairs forever, I mean, he knew her as well as anyone. He said that she and Nick had problems. But I guess you already knew that. He said that she used to disappear for days on end. - They had fights? - I guess. He said Nick was fascinated with her because she was secretive. But what does a guy with a chip for a brain know, right? I'll get it on my way out. I'm gonna go. - Yeah? - Yeah, I can't eat. - Okay. - Thank you. Bye, sweetie. I'll talk to you later. Where do you want this? I don't really want it. Well, sorry, you gotta take it. Orders from the prima donna downstairs. Okay, you can put it here. Mrs. Girard. You don't wanna tangle with her. The whole inventory's locked in. It's finished. - It's great to have an assistant. - It's great to be working again. - I'm so pleased. - Why did you offer me this job? I thought you'd be good at. You've got the background and now you'll get the experience. Right, Nick told me... Nick suggested it to you. Come on, Catherine. Nick said you wanted something to do. And a bit about your background in the art world. - Don't be so touchy. - Yeah, I'm sorry. I wanted to ask you... you saw something the other night, - didn't you? - Saw something? At your party, in the mirror. When you dropped that glass. I thought you saw her too. Her? The woman. The only woman I saw was you. Nick? Nick, you back? Rosebud, it's you. God, you scared me! Badge was right. You are delicious. Wait a minute, I want to show you something. Can't it wait? Who do you think did it? Who would do a thing like this? The power just dropped. You seem nervous. Is it the work? No, I love working with you. It's so much more involving than the gallery back in Paris. I'm glad. I know you well enough now to ask you from woman to woman. Is everthing all right with you and Nick? Yeah. Everything's fine. I'm just uneasy about living in this building, that's all. Go on. The truth is I feel like a kind of intruder. No. I think you belong here. Rosebud. Down. Good morning. - You know what time it is? - It's Sunday time. - What's the matter? - Nothing. A dream. Have you ever thought of us moving? No, why? Well, after what happened here to Stella... I've managed to put all of that behind us, where it belongs. Now good, bad or indifferent this place is a part of me and that's why I love it. I like it because it goes with you. I'd never lived in a loft before. It's so open, but... it's just sometimes I get the feeling of being watched. That's marriage. No, you know about marriage. It's new to me. Living with someone. First and last someone, I hope. What did Stella look like? Was she beautiful? She was very attractive. But she was a completely different person from you. She always seemed to be living on the edge. It was a difficult relationship. How did she die? Hasn't Nick told you? He doesn't want to talk about it. He must have said something. Yeah. He said it was some kind of a break-in. Stella put up a fight... and she was shot. Nick was in L.A. If he'd been here, he's sure she'd still be alive today. What happened, Badge? Tell me. It was the first freezing cold night of the year. Stella called maintenance complaining about the electricity. Maybe she let whoever it was in thinking it was the maintenance man. No one's sure. The same guy as now? Garnett. Yeah, he's been working here for years. He's pretty weird. Could it have been him? I don't think so. He found her body and called the police. God. Stella tried to defend herself. She was holding a large pair of scissors. Everyone here in the building was questioned, of course. The gun was never found. It's still a mystery. It leaves kind of an unpleasant feeling in the building. Yeah, it sure does. Still a building is just a place where things happen, like a theater or a studio. It's just a show. I've been thinking about moving. What does Nick think? He likes it here. He doesn't want to move. Good. I don't want you to go. Rosebud? Rosebud? Rosebud? I've never left water in the tub. - Ever in my life. - Maybe you just forgot. No way. Someone filled the tub. I had a shower this morning, so it was not me. You know, if you like, we can get another cat. I don't want another. Why are you getting angry with me? You know maybe those migraines are starting to affect your memory. There's nothing wrong with me, Nick. I just want you to be well. I am well! Nick. Before me, us... was there someone... was there a woman who had a key to this place? What other woman? What are you talking about? Someone after Stella. Of course not, why? Someone was in here today. - Catherine, I can't deal with this. - Deal with what? The only woman to ever have a key to this apartment was Stella. Stella's dead. Someone has a key to this place - now. - What the hell's a matter with you? I didn't fill the tub with water! Neither did I. Well somebody did. Then who left this? I found this on the counter. You can see, it's not my lipstick. So who's is it? How should I know? Badge? - Badge? - Badge, Daisy... she was here. Why are you making such a big deal out of this? Nick, are you sure you're not hiding something from me? I've got work to do. I want the locks changed. Otherwise I'm not staying here. Okay. All right, fine, I'll have them changed in the morning. You promise? Yeah, I promise. I'm just under pressure to get this track finished. I know, I'm sorry. It's happening all over again. She's going through the same thing Stella went through, remember? - Seeing things... - Catherine's seeing things? Well, yeah. I mean that's what she says. She thinks that there's someone else who has a key to our apartment. A woman. What woman? I don't know. What do you think the mathematical odds are of me marrying two paranoid women in one lifetime? It isn't a question of odds. Maybe you're drawn to women like that. Women like what? Maybe you're attracted by stressed-out women. Catherine is not stressed-out. - Yeah, sure. - She is nothing like Stella. Does she know about you and Badge? Of course not. Are you sure? Come on, women instinctively pick up on that sort of thing. Charlie, Catherine is seeing things. Yeah, well, if she's seeing things, why don't you get her to see a doctor? Are you okay? Catherine, what is it? Catherine. Catherine! Come and see. What are you looking for? The brush. - The brush? - The brush. - What are you looking for? - The brush! What brush? Catherine! Hey, are you okay? Thank you. I went to the doctor. I keep seeing things that I know can't be there. Really? What did he say? That I can stop taking those migraine pills for a while. He's right. In the end, pills won't do any good anyway, they never do. Unless you want to end it all. Daisy, where did that come from? No, I was just... I guess... I'm just not myself today, that's all. Charlie and me... I'm just not sure how things are going. You and Charlie? I don't believe it. You said the guy had a chip for a brain. I know, that was just cover. Fooled me. Why the secrecy? I don't want our relationship broadcast all over the place. I just wanna be really sure about him before we move in together. So you're that serious about him? Yeah. Yeah, but I mean... he just won't commit, and I'm not sure why. Is there somebody else? There certainly has been, hasn't there. Hi, it's Charlie. Look, I'm sorry I can't make dinner tonight like I promised, but... Something's come up. I'll call you real soon, I promise. I hope you didn't go to too much trouble. Hi, Badge. I'll light a candle for you. Yeah, stupid electricity. Nick will be home soon. He gets hungry for something around this time. And with the power being out... Are you all right? I can't see things right at the moment. I feel lost. We all feel lost sometimes. But in the end, everything sorts itself out. Yeah, I suppose so. Right. I'm out of here, if that's okay with you. You're okay with me. What are you doing? Mrs. Girard. I'm putting in the new locks your husband asked for. Oh, yes. What about the electricity? That I can't do nothing about. Some things in life are beyond our control. You'll need the new keys. Of course, how stupid of me. We all do stupid things from time to time. Thank you. Nick? Negative! Who's there? It's me. Mr. Negative. How the fuck did you get in? Well, I just walked down the stairs and the door was open. I'm falling apart. I'm sure I closed it. It's easily done when you've got things on your mind. It's okay, just leave it. - You okay? - Yeah. Look, I'm sorry this is so last minute but I've got these tickets. What are they for? For? They're for us. These are golddust. For Rigoletto? Who's he, an Italian middleweight? These are for the big fight. Just outside ringside. For these you gotta have - connections. - A fight? - Yeah, you know, boxing. - Yeah. I'm sure Nick'll love to go. Catherine, come on, we wouldn't leave you out. You're one of us now. One of us? What does that mean? Come on, it'll be a lot of fun. Disgusting hot dogs, some beer... You go with Charlie. I'll stay home and read a book. Yeah? Okay. It's something you should try once in your life. We set? You got the tickets, right? - You bet. - So you're not coming? No. I'm not big on hot dogs and beer, while two guys are killing each other. What are you big on? My own space, Charlie. - Last chance to change your mind. - No, I'm okay. - Yeah? Okay. - Yeah. "S. G. Stella Girard. Monday. Had my hair done. A new style which I knew Buddy would love. Friday. Had another fight with Nick after Buddy left. That's when it happened. Late at night I awoke and went for a glass of water. The whole kitchen looked different. Like I walked into someone else's house. I found a glass of water with lipstick on it. Definitely wasn't mine. When I got up this morning it was gone. The three of us went to the movies. I loved the film, so did Buddy. Nick hated it. As usual. Nick's trying to make me jealous." He's brought a woman here again, and he's denying everything. She's been here again. I keep finding her stuff. Clothes, books, flowers everywhere. I can't take this for much longer. I saw them. They were all over each other. Her hair was spread across my pillow. At first I couldn't watch, and when I finally looked again she was gone. - Had him in the 4th... - That's when he should have had him. - Is she okay? - I don't know. Charlie, - go get her a washcloth. - Yeah. Easy does it. Take your medication. No, I don't want it. What the hell happened? I can't tell you. It was like... something... someone. Someone, somebody was here? I don't know. You really should see a doctor. There was something in here, Nick. Yeah, you were attacked by a lamp, and it looks like the lamp won. Here. Why haven't you called the police? I called the doctor. Nick, it's not the pills. I'm not even taking them any more. Why the hell don't you believe me? I've got something to show you. I want you to explain this. Where's the diary? What diary? It was on the table. If you'd like, I will stay home with you. What difference would that make? People come in and out of here like we've got a revolving door. I wonder why, Catherine. I get the locks changed, and then Charlie tells me you left the door wide open? Here. You need to eat something. I'm sorry, I just thought maybe you were hungry. Catherine, I know this is not a good time to leave but I've got to go talk to those guys about this music score. I called Badge to come up here to be with you. I'm not sure that's such a great idea. Why? I thought you and Badge got along. I thought you liked her. Yes, I like her. God, it's this place I don't like. I want to move out of here, Nick. Move out? We're never gonna find another place like this. I don't want another place like this. How about some place out in the country? Couldn't we look there? Okay, a place in the country it is. If that'll make you happy. I gotta go. Come on, Daisy, you can do it. You don't need this. Don't make me chase you. You make me feel so wanted. You are. Does the brace turn you off? No, no. Leave it. It turns me on. Oh, Stella! - What did you say? - What? Fuck you, Charlie. What are you doing? You should be in bed. I'm just looking for something. What is it? It's an old recipe from Europe. Light years ahead of anything those high-priced quacks can come up with. I don't want it. Come on, don't be silly. Drink it. What's in it? Lt'll lift you up. Maybe you should get out of this place. I thought you said I belonged here. That was yesterday. It's open. Come up. Catherine, are you feeling better? I'm okay. - Can I talk to you - Yeah, sure. What's all this? Quantum mechanics. Could mean we've been here before. I've never been here before. There's a theory that those strange feelings we get of having been somewhere before are true. I believe it. Well not actually before, but that's what I'm working on. - This is what you do here all day? - Yeah. The theory suggests the past may not be before the present, it could be parallel to it. We think of it as the past because we created the idea of time being chronological. Well, the past is the past as far as I'm concerned. Charlie, I found Stella's diary. Stella kept a diary? What's in it? She wrote about a man she'd been seeing. - Has Nick seen this diary? - No. There's something else, she said that Nick was seeing someone too. She'd seen the woman with him in our apartment. Who was she? What would you think if I said the woman in the diary could be you? Me? I might think you were crazy. I didn't know Nick then. I'm not talking about then and now. There's a lot we don't know. I do know about Nick and Badge. Nick told me everything. About how they used to see each other. It was just one of those things, Catherine. Look, I know Nick wants to put this behind him. So why drag it all up now? Charlie, who was Buddy? Buddy? No idea. Catherine. Let it go. It's better for everyone. Especially you. Shit, the line's still busy. She's supposed to be there. Daisy's a flake. Look at this. And it's in the country, just like you wanted. Nick, who is Buddy? Buddy? Buddy who, Buddy Holly? Don't you have an old friend called Buddy? No. - Charlie? - Yeah, look. I gotta go, I'm running late. I'm on my way right out the door. All right. I tried to call you a couple times last night. Last night? I switched off the phone, I was working on some new software Didn't get much sleep. I'm sorry about what happened. Charlie, I love you. Me, too. Yeah, what you said. Me, too. Look, I gotta a couple of important things to do. I'll call you this afternoon, okay? Bye. Bye. Rise and shine. Daisy? Daisy, it's me. Are you okay? Why the mess? Charlie's lying to me. About what? Everything. So you're not moving in together? No, I guess that was never part of the plan. I guess he's never going to commit. Oh, Daisy. Come on, you can't stay here like this. Come stay with us for a while. No, I'm all right. I... Daisy, I want you to stay. Oh, my God, how'd you get that bruise? Something happened in the apartment. - What? - Someone... something was in there. I think. You think? Well, I'm starting to doubt myself. Nick doesn't believe me. He thinks there's something wrong with me, that I'm imagining things. It happened after I found her diary. Stella's diary. And then it disappeared and... God, I don't know. Maybe I am going crazy. No you're not. Trust your instincts. I think... I know it's got something to do with Stella. Daisy, I think she's alive. Catherine, you know that's not possible. You've been listening - to Charlie's time warp bullshit. - Is it bullshit? Okay, I think that I should come and stay for a while. I could use a friend. You said Stella's diary went missing, right? All the time I've been living there, I've never seen the diary before. So the big question is, who put it there? Someone deliberately put the diary on the shelf for me to find. Yeah, but I mean after that. Is it possible that Nick took it? Think about it. The locks have been changed, right? Who else could it be? I mean, who? Badge? Why would she do that? You know what this music reminds me of? I'm not sure I want to know. It reminds me of Stella. Okay, what do you say we change the subject, Charlie? So what's it like having two women in your place? It was Catherine's idea to have Daisy stay with us, not mine. Are you sure? You sure it wasn't Badge's idea? Man you've got an evil mind. Come on, you never thought about having two gals together? Thanks, ma'am. Thank you. - Beatrice Mller collection. - Catherine! - You gotta come up here right now. - Daisy, what is it? - Listen. - What's going on? Listen, I think I know who your intruder is. Daisy! Catherine, what is it? Daisy! Hey, what's going on? Daisy fell! Fell? She could have been pushed. Pushed by who? She was alone. You don't know that, Mr. Girard. Where was your wife? - Catherine was with me. - And where's Mrs. Girard now? She went out. She was a little hysterical. Catherine. Mrs. Girard. Daisy didn't kill herself. How do you know? I'm responsible. Catherine, you were with me. Just what are you saying, Mrs. Girard? I'm saying she didn't jump, she was pushed. Stella. That S could stand for suicide. - She wouldn't write that. - Stop it. Please, now this is absurd. You're just feeling guilty. It's my fault. Charlie, have you been following me? I want to help you. They all think I'm crazy. Nick, Badge, the police... Probably you. I can explain what's been happening. Explain away. - The Philadelphia Experiment... - Yeah, a science fiction movie. No, the real thing. In 1942 the Navy accidentally discovered... created a worm hole. A what? Einstein called them bridges. Passageways in the fabric of 4-dimensional space-time. Charlie, what are you talking about? I was involved in the Montauk Project, research into the findings of the Philadelphia Experiment. They were trying to create a way to warp space-time bringing two points, two events together. All the claims about traveling through time are consequences of basic scientific laws and quantum mechanics. Charlie, my best friend just died and you're telling me a story about worm holes? I don't understand. Catherine, listen. We both know who killed Daisy. Can I help you, miss? Yes, I'd like to buy a gun. No "problemo". Revolver or automatic? - A revolver, I think. - What caliber? Caliber? You do have a permit. - Sorry? - A pistol permit. I can't sell you anything without it. I thought I'd just buy the gun and then register it later. You planning on using it on a gun range? I just need a gun at home for self-defense. Okay, lady. You go downtown, to police headquarters, apply for a permit. If and when you get one, I'll be happy to supply you with anything you need. Okay? If and when. The reason I'm late... I went to buy a gun. Did you get one? No. So it's come to that, has it? I'm scared. What happened to Daisy has something to do with Stella. S is for suicide. I don't know. I feel something, some kind of hatred in the air. Hatred? There are times that it presses around me like a fog. You mean Stella hates you? Stella who's never met you, who's dead? I know it sounds crazy, but I think Stella's alive. You don't mean that literally. - Yes I do. - So let me get this right. You think everyone's lied about her death? Even me? I think that a woman died. A woman was shot, maybe by an intruder, maybe not. But the woman who died wasn't Stella. Stella's around here somewhere, I know it. Catherine, calm down. This is madness. Is it? I don't think so. For starters, she has a key to the loft. She comes in, even with the locks changed. There's one thing. Stella had a sister. A sister? A twin. It's Nancy Brook. She lives down in the suburbs. Here's her address and her... phone number. Why don't you check with her? I will. Don't look at me like that. I'll be all right, if only I can protect myself. From what? Lend me your gun. - My gun? - The one you keep in your bathroom cupboard. It's a 9 mm. I bought it a couple months ago in Germany. It's never been fired. - I have a permit for it. - It's heavy. You trust me with this? I trust you not to shoot yourself. - Daisy was not suicidal. - Catherine, Daisy was always unstable. Upset, yes. Unstable, no. Do you think I'm unstable? Thank you. Thank you very much. Let me give you some more of my instability. You know Stella kept a diary. - Yeah, so? - She had evidence of another woman. And you kept telling her that she was imagining things. And she was! She saw someone. A woman with dark hair, - in bed with you. - Okay. It's true, okay? Stella was jealous, yes, crazy jealous. She was jealous of everybody. It was like a disease. But she never seemed to get any better. I remember one night coming back from a recording studio, she comes up and she starts... smelling my clothing looking for any trace of another woman. Who was she, Nick? There was no one! Oh, but there was. On the night of Stella's so-called death, there was an intruder, a woman, and now there's another intruder. - What are you talking about? - That this time it's Stella, and don't tell me she's dead because she isn't. Nancy? - Nancy Brook? - You must be Catherine. Are you saying that the guy who killed your friend was the same guy who killed my sister? It wasn't a guy. A woman? Nancy, did Stella ever talk to you about having enemies? Although we were twins, we were never very close. Well, after we grew up. We shared a boyfriend once. Shared? Put it this way: She tried to steal him from me. She was so jealous. After she got married the first time... The first time? Yeah, you know, to the guy she married before Nick. He didn't tell you? That's Nick for you. Does Stella's first husband live out here? No, he's got a little camera-rental company back in the city. Stella was too young for Larry anyway. - Larry? - Jaffe. Larry Jaffe. The way he played around drove her nuts. Sometimes I used to think Stella got married to Nick just to get back at Larry. The fact is, he and Stella stayed pretty close. Listen, I wouldn't worry too much about this diary thing. I mean, Stella was always making up stuff. She was a very passionate person. Always falling in and out of love. I don't think she made anything up. Does Nick know you're here? This is between you and me, Mr. Jaffe. Larry. Stella was seeing another man. - Hey, slow down, Mrs. Girard. - Why should I? I heard you like fast women. They're my preference. Who was she seeing? Did she tell you? Someone called Buddy. Buddy. Does he have a last name? Friend of Nick's, she said. They weren't sleeping together, if that's what you're thinking. I think he was just someone she used to confide in. When she wasn't here with me, of course. Thanks for your help, Barry. Larry. If you're ever thinking - of dropping by... - I just did. Catherine! What's going on? Where have you been? All my stuff! Who do you think did this? - Charlie. - Charlie? What are you saying? - Badge! - Stop it, Catherine! The maintenance man, or Daisy. Daisy is dead! How about Stella? What about you? Are you crazy? Do you think I'd mess up my own things? Nick, listen to me. She did it. What "she" are you talking about? What "she" do you think? I think maybe that "she" is you. Fuck you! It's here. - What is? - The diary. Stella's diary is here. - This is the book? - Yes. I told you. Catherine, I've never seen this book before. "I had my hair done, a new style which I knew Buddy would love." I still don't know who Buddy is. - You must know. - No, I'm not lying to you. "I saw them. They were all over each other. Her hair was spread across my pillow. At first I couldn't watch, and when I finally looked again she was gone." She's been here again. She left her dress on the bed to taunt me. Oh my God. This wasn't in here before. What are you talking about? I'm telling you, the diary stopped before this. This is a new entry. And these. Nick's little friend keeps getting in here. When I was brushing my hair, I realized it was her brush I was holding in my hand. A strange cat got in here. I ran out to tell Buddy, but he wasn't home. When I came back, everything seemed different. She'd put flowers everywhere. She and Nick are trying to drive me insane. You're sure it's her writing? I'm sure it is. But this can't be. She's got a friend called Daisy. I meant to scare her, - she backed away... - Stella killed Daisy! - Stella is dead. - Now the only one to get rid of... is Catherine. Oh my God, Nick, she's written my name. I'm so sorry, Catherine. I'm so sorry I did not believe you. This can't be, but it is. I knew it. Nick, we've got to get out of here. Why don't you go ahead to the Servello Hotel. I'll pack a few things. Charlie, we found it. Found what? Stella's diary. It was back in the apartment. She mentions me by name. Do you understand? She's still writing it! I want to know, who's Buddy? Look, I have to talk to Nick. No more lies, Charlie. I know who Buddy is. Catherine... Look out! Charlie! No, Charlie! Charlie. Can you talk? Buddy... Buddy was me. I know. What do you mean, she hasn't checked in? She should have been here an hour ago. Look, I'm really sorry, Mr. Girard. Sorry, ma'am, you can't use that cell phone in here. Why not? It could interfere with the hospital instruments. Please, switch it off. Stella... No, it's me, Catherine. I was in love with her. She was... she was one woman with... Nick, but with me... she... Yes? When she died... I couldn't take it... I was obsessed with work. Charlie, take it easy. Stella... Stella doesn't... understand. It's up to me, isn't it? I've got to tell her what's happening. Oh, Mrs. Girard. It's you. You'll have to walk up. The electricity's out again. - Can I take your flashlight? - Sure. Are you okay? For God's sake, Catherine, turn your phone on. Stella. I know you can hear me. Stella! Stella! Stella. I've been waiting for you. It's you. You thought I was away, didn't you? I knew it was you. Why are you doing this to me? This is my home. My husband. Get out, - you bitch. - Listen to me. You've been messing with my diary. Just like your friend Daisy. Did you have to kill her? It was an accident. She got scared, she fell. Stella, don't you see? We both belong here, but in different times. This is our home, our husband. What are you talking about? Buddy explained it to me. He believes there's a way to bring things forward from the past into the future. You and I, we're both living in different moments in time. It's an accident. It wasn't supposed to happen. What bullshit! Nick is mine, he's my husband! And I'm warning you, I won't give him up. I'd rather die. You did die. I'm here, look at me! If I died, how did I die? You were murdered. By who? I don't know. How long did you and Nick think I'd put up with this? Nick is my husband now. I love him. You don't know what love is. You're not going to scare me, not like Daisy. She stole Buddy from me, you stole Nick. Now get out! Catherine? What's going on, Catherine? What are you doing? Stella. Stella? Over there. Where, Catherine? She's right there. See? Nonsense, Ms. Girard. Your whole story is nonsense. It's the truth. - I've arranged for a psychiatrist. - What? If we can prove you've been under severe stress... You're wasting your time with the psychiatric crap, Lieberman. We're going for murder one. You're saying I'm crazy? All I'm saying is a quiet period of time in a comfortable hospital - is a lot better than... - You don't believe me either! Of course I believe you. Catherine Girard, I'm charging you with the murder of Stella Girard. You have the right to remain silent. - You also have the right to... - Silent? Silent? You want me to remain silent? - What the hell are you saying? - Sit down, Ms. Girard. I won't sit down! And I won't take any more crap from you. - I told you nothing but the truth. - Catherine, please. Shut up! If you'd taken any trouble at all, you'd have found that the gun wasn't even registered last year. We know that, Ms. Girard. It's on the data base. But half the guns in this city aren't registered at all. - Now sit down. - You checked the data base? - Is that all? - It's enough. It's a 9mm. I bought it a couple months ago - in Germany. - You know when it was registered, but do you know when it was bought? Or where? I'll tell you. The gun was brand new a couple of months ago. It had never been fired. Badge Mller keeps very thorough records. And what about German export papers? Papers that will show the exact date this year when the gun was made and imported? Export papers. From Germany. Badge Mller buys everything on her gold card. She keeps all her gold card transactions. The serial number of the gun will be on her credit card records, on microfilm. Check it out! Book her! You're free to go, Mrs. Girard. - What? - For the time being. Look, we've located the microfilm. Mrs. Mller's credit card record for the purchase of the gun. The serial number matches up with the sales slips. The dates indicate that the gun was bought new, this year, in Germany. At least you checked something. Yeah? And meanwhile your lawyer checked up on the Montauk Project. - And? - It's nonsense and you know that! It's the truth. Your lawyer couldn't find a goddamn thing. The Navy has no record of any such project in any form. - But... - Nothing! You're lucky I don't bring a charge against you for wasting police time. What are you saying? Making a false confession lady, is a serious offense. Take it from me. We won't believe anything you've got to say in the future. Get her out of here. How did you ever come up with it? I mean, the whole gun thing. - I had lots of time to think. - It was brilliant. - I've got to go to the toilet. - Yeah. The police are never going to believe the truth, are they? Does it really matter? You and I are together, we're safe. How's Charlie? Did you talk to him? Catherine, Charlie didn't make it. I'm sorry. I'm so happy here. This is the life I wanted. Just the two of us. And now, we can forget about the past.
