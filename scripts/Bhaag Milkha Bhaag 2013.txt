O Lord! May l die on my feet, not on my knees. Abdul Khaliq was Pakistan's pride. The fastest runner in Asia. Milkha couldn't wait to see him run. The next day he was to run against him. l'm grateful to my countrymen and to Coach Javed. Salaam! - Thanks. Javed sir. Your boy ran well. Congratulations. - Thank you. Bravo! You ruled the field. Thank you, sir. This is Milkha Singh. lndia's 400m champion athlete. Hello, sir. You're competing in the 200m race. All the best. To you too. Watch out. Watch out, Khaliq. l hear you ran away from Pakistan... ... have been running ever since, huh? Now you need to show your magic in 200m as well. Come. We've seen dozens like Milkha. We have two choices... ... leave our village and go to the new lndia. Or change our religion as they ask. We shall not eat cow's meat! They can behead us, but we will never change our religion! Prepare to fight then. When Guru Govind Singh left Anantpur Sahib... ... and reached Garhwal fort... ... he had only 40 Sikhs with him. While the enemy were a million! Guruji dressed his sons in armour... ...and sent them to battle. His forty men fought hard. They fought a mighty army. How will we fight? They have weapons, horses... And us? What do we have? Enough of bravado! Thousands are leaving for lndia... ... we should go too. A sparrow will challenge an eagle, A lamb will fight a lion, One man will fight a million. Guru Govind Singh, bless us! A sparrow will challenge an eagle, A lamb will fight a lion, One man will fight a million. Guru Govind Singh, bless us! Come on. Milkha. Are you alright, son? Jai Hind sir. Today, you won't salute us, we salute you. The whole unit salutes you. lndia salutes you. Proud. Milkha, you are an officer now. No. All because of the pat on my back and a kick on my butt from you sir. Stay well, my son. l wish you a thousand joys. You have made me happy. Congratulations to his friends! Many many congratulation for Milkhas winning. Let's celebrate! "Bite through the electric fire" "Chew the metal's vibrating current" "Set aflame your every pore" "Without burning yourself there's no glow" "The flames are burning Milkha" "Run Milkha" Excuse me. Can l have a photograph please? Of course. Thank you. Son, you have made us proud. Now make lndia's flag flutter high at the Rome Olympics. The hopes of all lndia ride on you. l will run like my life depends on it. Wonderful. Son, what can we do for you? Panditji, if l win, can you declare a national holiday? Of course. A call from Pakistan. Gentlemen. Excuse me, please. - Yes. Ladies and Gentlemen. An important announcement... ... what a coincidence that while you are all here and... ... Pakistan's President, Field Marshal Ayub Khan has called. He has accepted my proposal of the lndo-Pak friendship games. lt's an important step toward friendship... ... between our two nations. l would like... ... Milkha Singh to lead our contingent... ... to Pakistan. All eyes were on Milkha. But there was a storm brewing in Milkha's head. Milkha, run! Run! Why are you standing here? Son. Son. Listen to me... ... don't be scared. No harm will come to you. ... don't be scared. Son, be brave. You'll be fine. Run, Milkha! Run! Get out of here. Run, Milkha! Run! Don't turn back to look! So, Pakistan is a terrible memory for Milkha... ... and we have come to revive those memories. We have reached Chandigarh. We've reached. But what shall we say to Milkha? You have a nice garden. lt seems gardening interests you. Seems so. lt has suddenly turned cold in Chandigarh hasn't it? You're right. Thank you. Sir, sugar? - One spoon. Thank you. So much sugar, Milkha? lt's not good for you. Oh! That's mine... You aren't here to discuss the weather and sugar. Milkha, Nehruji wants to meet you. l can't do it sir. My feet won't move. My family's blood is in that air, l won't be able to breathe. Son... You're a soldier. Your country needs you now. lf you must wage war with your own self for it... ... then you should. Right now, it's important.. Peace and harmony must prevail between our countries. Sports are an important means to that goal. That's all very well, sir... ... but why won't Milkha Singh meet the press? What's the problem? Did he rebuff Khaliq's challenge? Why the empty chair? He knows coming to Pakistan... ... is a mistake. Mr. Khaliq, can you defeat him? God willing But where is Milkha Singh? Everyone, please sit down! Mother! Why are you crying? Crying is no good. Don't cry. Your photo... ls this you? Red is the maiden's veil... Red are tomatoes... Red like Sampreet's butt! ... Milkha's butt. Sampreet! Milkha. l thought you were... l Survived... People aren't bad, Milkha. But circumstances can make them bad. Partition was a bad time. Remember our Muslim teacher... ... he raised me and got me married. Some milk? You love it l'm told. - Yes, sister-in-law. Aren't you the Milkha Singh who runs? l am... ... the one who runs. The connections are done, start the radio. Hey, change the station. Just a minute. Just by looking at the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore... ... it seems as though entire Pakistan has turned up... ... in lndia everyone's heart is beating faster. We can see the planes throwing colour in the skies... ... and General Ayub Khan of Pakistan... ... is entering the stadium in his magnificent cavalcade. Your Excellency, good morning. - Welcome to Pakistan. Thank you, sir. - All the best. Same to you, sir. - Sir. All the best. - Thank you, sir. Best of luck. - Thank you, sir. All the best. - Thank you, sir. All the best, Milkha Singh. - Thank you, sir. Khaliq. Pakistan's hopes are riding on you. l will do my best. All the best. - Thank you, sir. And the tension is building. lt's as if everyone is breathing together, ... or rather everyone has stopped breathing. Leave them far behind you. No one can defeat you. No, Milkha. You're the best. You're the champ. Squad.. Go, my lion! Run! Go, son. Do it. Yes. Milkha Singh. This could be the last race of your life. That's how l'll run it. On your mark. There is absolute silence... ... everyone's eyes are on the race track. Who will win? lndia's hope Milkha Singh... ... or Pakistan's star athlete, Asia's tornado, Abdul Khaliq. Squad... The gun is fired and the race has begun. Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq is leading the pack... ... looks as though he has decided to come and win today. He seems to be reaching his goal effortlessly. Without a care, without a worry, he is running towards the finish line. Looks like his feet are about to kiss victory. Come on. - Come on, son. But wait a minute! Something else is happening here... ... Milkha Singh is suddenly catching up... ... and one by one he is leaving everyone behind! And with such ease he has now overtaken Pakistan's Abdul Khaliq! This can only be called a miracle which we may not ever get to witness again. lt seems as though Milkha Singh has grown wings... ... the wind is carrying him forward... ... or he is running above the clouds. Come on, Milkha. "Throw off all your cares and troubles" "The skeletons of the past" "The soles of your feet are like horse shoes" "You've got to do it come what may" "You are fire Milkha" Hail Mother lndia! To celebrate Milkha Singh's glorious victory in Pakistan... ... l propose a public holiday in this honour. Milkha has planted the lndian flag! He's done it! No one has ever run like you did today. You didn't run my son, you flew. From now on the world will know you as... ... 'The Flying Sikh.' Pakistan bestows this title upon you... ... with pride and honour. Well done, my boy. Well done.
