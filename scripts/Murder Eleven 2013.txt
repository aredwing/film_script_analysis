IT'S STILL EARLY, SO WE HAVE SOME TIME TO GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER. [ WHIMPERING CONTINUES ] DON'T DO THAT. I DON'T LIKE IT. IT COULD MAKE YOUR, UH, MAKEUP SMEAR, AND THAT WILL NOT BE ATTRACTIVE. STOP IT. LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU, BUT I WILL BASH YOUR FUCKING BRAINS IN! [ CHUCKLES ] I'M JOKING. I'M JUST KIDDING. I'M JUST KIDDING. I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN, I GOT NO PROBLEM KILLING YOU, PER SE, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE VIOLENT. I'D, UH... JUST SUFFOCATE YOU. YOU KNOW, SOMETHING PEACEFUL LIKE THAT. [ SCRAPING ] [ WHIMPERING CONTINUES ] [ SIGHS ] YOU SURE ARE PRETTY. OKAY, HERE'S THE PLAN. I'M GONNA GET YOU OUT OF THOSE CLOTHES. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A NICE, HOT BATH. UH, I-I'M SORRY, WHAT? [ WHIMPERING CONTINUES ] OH, YEAH. I CAN LEAVE SOME MUSIC ON FOR YOU. I MEAN, WOULD THA HELP RELAX YOU? OKAY -- AND, WHEN I TAKE THE GAG OUT, DON'T BOTHER TO SCREAM. [ SCREAMS ] THERE'S NO ONE THAT'S GONNA HEAR YOU, DARLING. [ WHIMPERING CONTINUES ] STOP WITH THE FUCKING CRYING. Shh! [ WOMAN BREATHING SHAKILY ] YOU ARE NOT GONNA RUIN THIS NIGHT FOR ME. IT IS A VERY SPECIAL NIGHT. MY ADVICE FOR YOU IS SIMPLE -- LET YOUR MIND WANDER. MAYBE IMAGINE YOU'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE. AWW. DON'T WORRY. IT'S ALL GOING TO BE OKAY. TRUST ME. [ SIRENS WAILING ] [ SOFT MUSIC PLAYS ] THANKS, RUE. YOU'RE WELCOME, SUGAR. [ CHUCKLES ] I-IT'S BEEN, UH, ALMOST 10 YEARS SINCE I'VE HAD A PARTNER ASSIGNED TO ME, SO FORGIVE ME IF IT TAKES A MINUTE TO GET USED TO YOU. UH, YOU MUST BE SOME KIND OF GOLDEN BOY. Jesse: WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? THERE ARE 10 COPS AHEAD OF YOU FOR THIS SPOT. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] CHIEF'S DISCRETION, I SUPPOSE. AND THE CAPTAIN FORCES YOU ON ME. NO. I ASKED IF I COULD PARTNER WITH YOU. OH, THE CAPTAIN ISN'T ONE TO EASILY GRANT FAVORS -- NOT UNLESS THEY BENEFIT HIM. YEAH, WELL, MAYBE HE FIGURED YOU NEEDED SOME HELP. PERHAPS YOU GO NAKED PICTURES OF HIM WITH A WOMAN WHO'S NOT HIS WIFE. I KNOW HOW YOU UNDERCOVER BOYS ROLL. [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF I HAD, I WOULD HAVE MADE HIM LET ME DRIVE. THEN YOU MUST BE GOLDEN. [ CHUCKLES ] [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] SHOULD WE CUT THE SHIT? OKAY. I WAS KICKED OU OF NARCOTICS. I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE. WE BOTH KNOW THIS. USUALLY, WHEN YOU'RE KICKED OUT OF A UNIT, YOU WIND UP ON A FOOT BEAT, NOT ON HOMICIDE. YEAH, WELL, USUALLY WHEN YOU'RE KICKED OUT OF A UNIT, YOU FUCKED UP. I DIDN'T. I GOT TOLD TO MOVE ON, BUT I COULD LAND WHEREVER I WANTED. AND YOU CHOSE THE MURDER POLICE. IF YOU'RE GONNA PLAY, YOU MIGHT AS WELL PLAY BIG. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DETECTIVE? LOOKING TO HI THAT HOME RUN? CLEAR YOUR NAME, GET YOURSELF BACK IN NARCOS? [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] LOOK, I CAN'T TALK. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] [ SIGHS ] [ SIGHS ] LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB, DETECTIVE, OKAY? I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANY GLORY OR ANY REDEMPTION. I'M JUST HERE TO WORK. SO WHY THIS CASE? WHAT KIND OF COP WOULD I BE IF I DIDN'T TAKE THIS CASE ON? YOU CARE ABOU THESE GIRLS? YEAH, I DO. GOOD. 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK THE MAYOR, THE CHIEF, OR YOUR BUDDY, THE CAPTAIN, REALLY CARE IF WE CATCH THIS GUY OR NOT. HUH. AS LONG AS HE'S NOT KILLING TOURISTS, RIGHT? [ CHUCKLES ] THIS IS ATLANTIC CITY. UNLESS OUR SERIAL KILLER STARTS DROPPING BODIES ON THE CASINO FLOOR, NO ONE'S GONNA GIVE A DAMN. [ DOOR OPENS ] YOU READY? 'CAUSE I'M READY. [ CHUCKLES ] [ ENGINE SHUTS OFF ] [ BREATHING SHAKILY ] [ THUDDING ] [ MUFFLED SCREAMING ] HEY, HEY, HEY. SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH. SHUT YOUR MOUTH. [ WHIMPERING ] YOU REMEMBER EVERYTHING WE SPOKE ABOUT, RIGHT? MM-HMM. YOU KNOW THE DEAL? HUH? GOOD. [ BREATHING SHAKILY ] Shh. [ GULPS ] [ SOBBING ] [ SIREN WAILS ] FOR THE PAST 10 WEEKS, WE'VE FOUND A DEAD PROSTITUTE EVERY SATURDAY MORNING. WE KNOW THEY'RE BEING KILLED SOMETIME LATE FRIDAY NIGH INTO THE EARLY HOURS OF SATURDAY. Jesse: AND ALL THE GIRLS WERE LAST SEEN SOMETIME BEFORE 5:00 P.M. ON FRIDAY. WHICH MEANS WE GO ABOUT A SEVEN-HOUR WINDOW BETWEEN WHEN THEY GO MISSING AND HE KILLS THEM. WE GOT SURVEILLANCE UNITS STATIONED AT THE THREE PRIMARY HOTELS AND TWO MAIN STRIP CLUBS. WE GOT STREET CRIMES RUNNING STOP-AND-POPS UP AND DOWN THE AVENUE, LOOKING FOR JOHNS. AND WE GOT VICE THROWING CASH TO THEIR SNITCHES. NOW, OF THE 10 GIRLS WE KNOW, SOME OF THEM DIDN'T WORK CORNERS OR STRIP CLUBS, RIGHT? YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THREE. BUT WE HAVE NO INDICATION OF HOW HE MEETS THEM. NO. THE THREE HOTELS WE CHOSE ARE THE ONES THAT VICE SAID HAVE THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF PROSTITUTION COMPLAINTS AND ARRESTS. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. BUT WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT THESE GIRLS ACTUALLY WORKED THESE PARTICULAR HOTELS. NO, BUT TWO OF THE VICTIMS HAD PRIOR ARRESTS AT THE CASINO HOTELS. ALL RIGHT, SO... WHAT ARE WE MISSING? HOW DOES HE MEET THESE GIRLS? NONE OF THEM PLACED ADS IN THE LOCAL SEX-FOR-HIRE PAPERS. NONE OF THEM WERE HIGH-END CALL GIRLS. WHAT OPTIONS ARE WE NOT SEEING? WHAT IF THERE IS A HIGH-END CALL SERVICE FOR LOW-END PROSTITUTES? HUH. TYPE OF SERVICE ALL THE GIRLS COULD USE TO MEET THEIR DATES. NO. YOU KNOW, IF THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT AROUND HERE, VICE WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT. WHO SAYS IT HAS TO EXIS AROUND HERE? WELL, WE KNOW THA SOME OF THE GIRLS CAME FROM OUT OF TOWN. MAYBE ALL OF THEM WERE HIRED ELSEWHERE. HEAD DOWN TO THE OLD CONVENTION CENTER. WHAT FOR? I'VE GOT AN INFORMANT. SHE OWES ME A FAVOR, AND... SHE HELPS BRING IN OUT-OF-TOWN WORKING GIRLS TO HELP WITH THE BIG CONVENTIONS. GOOD. LET'S GO. Woman: HEY, BABY. HEY. THOUGHT I'D, UH, SURPRISE YOU WITH SOME CHINESE FOOD FOR DINNER. YEAH. YEAH, I-I'M VERY SURPRISED. I -- YEAH, WELL, I GOT MY MOM TO PICK THE KIDS UP FROM THE SITTER, AND JULIE SAID SHE'D TAKE MY SECOND SHIFT AT WORK SO WE COULD HAVE A NICE, QUIET DINNER TOGETHER. OH, THAT'S NICE. YEAH. IT IS, ISN'T IT? [ CHUCKLES ] AND I MISS MY HUSBAND. AWW, I MISS YOU, TOO, BABY. [ CHUCKLES ] MM. I LOVE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT ME. YEAH? Yeah. MM. I SAY... WE TAKE THIS FOOD... [ CHUCKLES ] ...A BOTTLE OF WINE... MM-HMM. ...HEAD DOWN TO THE BEACH. MM-HMM. A NICE, ROMANTIC DINNER UNDER THE STARS. I'LL GRAB THE WINE. [ CHUCKLES ] LET'S GO. [ CHUCKLES ] [ THUDDING ] WHAT WAS THAT? NOTHING. I WAS WORKING OUT THERE EARLIER. [ CHUCKLES ] IS THERE SOMEBODY IN THE GARAGE? NO. OF COURSE NOT. COME ON. LET'S GO. SAM. SAMANTHA. LET GO OF ME! [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] WHAT THE FUCK? [ WHIMPERING ] SAM, STOP. SAMANTHA! LEAVE HER BE! OW! FUCK. OW! LEAVE HER BE, OKAY? [ WHIMPERING ] THIS -- Shh! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? JUST... LET ME EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, OKAY? LET GO OF ME. OW! UGH! SAMANTHA! STOP! LISTEN TO ME. STOP! OW! LISTEN TO ME! CALM DOWN! OKAY? JUST LET ME EXPLAIN. AAH! LET ME EXPLAIN. GET OFF OF ME! STOP! JUST -- GET THE FUCK OFF ME! SAM. SAMANTHA. [ PANTING ] SAM. SAM, DON'T DO THIS, OKAY? JUST LET ME IN THE DOOR. [ BANGS DOOR ] OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR. [ SOBS ] SAM... PLEASE, JUST TALK TO ME, OKAY? PLEASE, TALK TO ME. [ TELEPHONE BEEPS ] [ Dial tone ] [ TELEPHONE BEEPS ] SAM, DON'T MAKE THIS CALL. PUT THE PHONE DOWN, OKAY? YOU MAKE THIS CALL, AND THERE'S NO GOING BACK. PUT THE FUCKING PHONE DOWN, SAM! [ BREATHES SHAKILY ] [ SOBS ] BABY, I KNOW YOUR MIND IS RUNNING ABOUT A THOUSAND MILES A MINUTE, AND I AM SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO SEE THIS. I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO FIND OU THIS WAY, OKAY? PLEASE, JUST LET ME TALK YOU THROUGH THIS. YOU'RE PLANNING ON TALKING ME THROUGH THIS?! IF YOU CAN REMAIN CALM AND BE OPEN TO WHA I HAVE TO SAY, YES. YOU'VE GOT A STRANGE WHITE WOMAN TIED UP IN OUR GARAGE! I UNDERSTAND THAT. JUST LET ME STAR AT THE BEGINNING AND TELL YOU EVERYTHING, OKAY? DO YOU RAPE THEM? NO. NO. GOD, NO. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. THEN WHAT'S IT LIKE, RICHARD? IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN IN WORDS. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT WOMAN? I'M GOING TO KILL HER. [ WHIMPERS ] I'M SORRY -- THERE IS A DEMON INSIDE OF ME. ONE THAT I HAVE FOUGH FOR YEARS -- ONE I THOUGHT I KILLED AND I BURIED A LONG TIME AGO... ...THE DAY I MET YOU. 'CAUSE YOU SHOWED ME THAT THERE WAS A LOVE THAT I NEVER KNEW EXISTED. THEN WE STARTED OUR FAMILY, OKAY? I NEVER THOUGH I'D GO BACK THERE... BUT IT HIT ME AGAIN... AND I LOST CONTROL. SO, WHAT, YOU JUST DECIDED TO DESTROY OUR FAMILY?! I DON'T WANT TO DESTROY OUR FAMILY. I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING INTENTIONALLY TO HURT YOU. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT YOUR INTENTIONS! I CARE ABOUT YOUR ACTIONS! [ Voice breaking ] WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? OKAY, YOU WANT TO KNOW? HUH? A FEW WEEKS AGO, I'M AT THE JOB SITE, AND THERE'S THESE DISGUSTING WHORES WORKING THE CORNERS, SHOWING ME THEIR TITS, TELLING ME TO COME GE WHAT MY WIFE DOESN'T GIVE ME. YEAH. YEAH, IT TOOK ME BACK TO A PLACE THAT I'D LEFT A LONG TIME AGO -- A PLACE THAT I NEVER THOUGH I'D RETURN, BUT I DID. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT MADE ME WANT TO KILL AGAIN! SO I FUCKING DID! SO YOU'RE THE ONE KILLING ALL THOSE PROSTITUTES? YES. YES, I AM. I'M SORRY. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE. [ DOOR HINGES CREAKING ] DO YOU SLEEP WITH THEM BEFORE YOU KILL THEM? NO, BABY. DON'T LIE TO ME, RICHARD. I'M NOT LYING. I'D NEVER CHEAT ON YOU. SO THIS ISN'T SOME SICK SEXUAL FETISH YOU HAVE? I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU LIKE THAT. NEVER. [ SCOFFS ] BUT YOU'D HURT ME LIKE THIS? YOU'D HUR OUR FAMILY LIKE THIS? Mayfield: ALL RIGHT... MAYBE IT'S ME. I'M MISSING SOMETHING. DID YOU FIND ANYTHING IN THAT CASE FILE THAT, UH, LINKS THESE GIRLS? NO. [ SIGHS ] NOTHING. EXCEP THEY'RE ALL PROSTITUTES. WHY KILL THEM? THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. EASY TARGETS. EASY TO GET AWAY WITH. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE NUMBER OF PROSTITUTES IN THIS CITY AND THAT EVERY JOHN THEY'VE BEEN WITH AND PIMP THEY'VE WORKED FOR IS A SUSPECT, THE ODDS ARE CLEARLY IN THE KILLER'S FAVOR. MOST OF THESE GIRLS DON'T EVEN HAVE FAMILY, AND THE FRIENDS THEY KEEP ARE OTHER PROSTITUTES WHO DON'T WANT TO GE INVOLVED. SOME POLITICIANS DON'T GIVE A DAMN. THERE'S NO "MOTHERS AGAINS DEAD PROSTITUTES" MAKING A STINK. SO, WHAT? THIS GUY JUST KILLS THESE GIRLS BECAUSE IT'S EASY? WHY NOT? YEAH, MAYBE THAT'S THE ONLY MOTIVE. WHAT IF HE'S THAT SICK? [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] IT'S JESSE. YEAH, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? OKAY. OKAY. GOOD. YEAH, YOU GOT A FAVOR ON THE BOOKS. YOU BE SAFE. WHAT YOU GOT? THERE IS A SERVICE OPERATED BY A PIMP OUT OF PHILLY. HE COMES DOWN EVERY WEEKEND WITH A GROUP OF GIRLS, SETS THEM UP AT A MOTEL SOMEWHERE OFF ROUTE 40, AND THEN HE USES ONLINE CHAT ROOMS AND WEBSITES TO SET THEM UP WITH THEIR DATES. A FEW OF THE VICTIMS HAD PRIORS IN PHILLY. YEAH, BUT HE OPERATES THIS LOCALLY, AS WELL. HE SETS THE GIRLS UP AT PUBS, CLUBS, CASINOS, HOTELS, MOTELS -- EVERYWHERE. THERE'S THE VARIETY. YEAH, BUT IF YOU'RE A PIMP, YOU'RE GONNA KNOW IF Y-YOUR GIRLS ARE GOING MISSING, FOR GOD'S SAKE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. WHAT IF HE'S LESS OF A PIMP AND MORE OF AN AGENT? OKAY. OPERATES OUT OF SEVERAL CITIES WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED GIRLS. NUMBERS GAME. SO, HE'S RUNNING A HUGE SYSTEM OF PROSTITUTION UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST. IF HE LOSES A GIRL HERE OR THERE, HE DOESN'T EVEN NOTICE. BECAUSE IT'S A NETWORK. I'VE WANTED TO TELL YOU FOR SO LONG. KEEPING A SECRET FROM YOU IS HELL ON ME. WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO ME WHEN THE URGES RETURNED? BEFORE YOU STARTED MURDERING WOMEN? I CONTROLLED THE URGES AT FIRST. YOU KNOW, THEY'D COME AND GO, AND I DEAL WITH THEM MYSELF. THEN ONE DAY, I WAS LEAVING WORK, AND ONE OF THEM WHORES WALKED UP TO MY CAR WINDOW. THEN WHAT? SHE TOLD ME I COULD FUCK HER FOR $20. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? I, UM... I GRABBED HER. UM... SHOW ME. WHAT? IF I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO A MONSTER AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, I WANT TO SEE IT. I'M NOT A MONSTER. MAYBE AT TIMES, I CAN BE, OR PART OF ME CAN BE. THEN SHOW ME THAT PART OF YOU. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE THAT. SHOW ME. NO. SHOW ME! I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE IT. SHOW -- I GRABBED THAT CUNT WHORE BY THE BACK OF THE HEAD, DRAGGED HER ASS INTO MY CAR, DROVE DOWN THE ROAD AT 60 MILES PER HOUR AS I BASHED HER FUCKING HEAD INTO THE DASHBOARD! AND THEN I PULLED OVER, SNAPPED HER NECK LIKE A FUCKING TWIG... [ GASPING ] ...AND LEFT HER ASS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. [ INHALES DEEPLY ] [ COUGHS ] [ SIGHS ] I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME. ALL I CAN DO IS BEG FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS. HOW CAN I EVEN CONTEMPLATE FORGIVING YOU... OR EVEN UNDERSTANDING YOU... WHEN I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE? DON'T SAY THAT. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS WORLD THAT TRULY KNOWS WHO I AM. WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE WE WERE 18 YEARS OLD. I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANYONE OR ANYTHING AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU AND OUR TWO KIDS. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL NOW, HUH? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT? HOW DO I GO ON FROM THIS? I NEED YOU. I NEED YOU TO HELP ME. GOD, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING. NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHICH ROOMS. I HOPE WE'RE NO TOO LATE. Jesse: YEP. 'CAUSE IF HE ALREADY HAS HER... [ SIGHS ] WELL, THEN SHE'S ALREADY DEAD. OR CLOSE TO IT. [ SIGHS ] I THINK WE FOUND OUR ROOM. I-I KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID. I AM MORE THAN JUST AFRAID. I AM SCARED TO DEATH. TONIGHT WAS GONNA BE THE LAST NIGHT. THIS WAS GONNA BE THE LAST GIRL, I SWEAR. HOW CAN YOU SWEAR TO ANYTHING WHEN YOU SAY YOU CAN'T EVEN CONTROL IT YOURSELF? THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT HER HERE. I-I KNEW I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD HIT ME IN THE FACE -- SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS REAL, SOMETHING TO HIT HOME. WHY? I DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO TELL YOU, AND... I HAD TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD TRIGGER ME TO WANT TO CHANGE. NO. NO -- WHY DO YOU KILL PROSTITUTES? WHY DO YOU HATE THEM SO MUCH? [ SIGHS ] THANK YOU, MISS. YOU BE SAFE, OKAY? I WANT YOU TO GET US A ROOM. THAT CORNER ROOM OR ONE LIKE IT. THEN SPEAK TO THE OTHER GIRL IN 115. I'LL BE IN TOUCH WITH STREET CRIMES AND GET US SURVEILLANCE ASSISTANCE. AND YOU'LL TELL DISPATCH TO KEEP LOCAL UNITS OUT OF HERE SO THEY DON' SPOOK ANYONE. LISTEN, DON'T I.D. YOURSELF FOR THE HOTEL CLERK. WHY? WELL, OUR KILLER COULD CALL FIRST, PRETEND TO BE POLICE DISPATCH, AND INQUIRE ABOUT THE OFFICERS WORKING TONIGHT. IT'S AN OLD TRICK TO SPOT SURVEILLANCE. RIGHT, AND THE CLERK, KNOWING NO BETTER JUST PASSES HIM STRAIGH THROUGH TO OUR ROOM. I GET IT. HE'S BEEN BETTER THAN US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. LET'S BE BETTER THAN HIM TONIGHT. THERE ARE THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD... ...THINGS I'M AFRAID TO TELL YOU. Samantha: I KNOW YOU HAD A TOUGH LIFE GROWING UP -- BOUNCING AROUND FROM FOSTER HOMES. CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT HELL THAT WAS LIKE. BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU. YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING. EVERYTHING ABOUT ME IS A LIE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I'VE LIED SO OFTEN, I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS ANYMORE. LIES ABOUT WHO I AM, WHERE I'M FROM. I CAN'T KEEP TRACK. JUST TELL ME EVERYTHING, OKAY? I CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE YOU. MAKE ME UNDERSTAND. I DIDN'T GROW UP IN FOSTER HOMES. I WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER OFF IF I DID. BUT I MET YOUR FOSTER PARENTS IN COLLEGE. NO, I JUST CALLED THEM THAT. THEY WERE A COUPLE TEACHERS FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHO TOOK INTEREST IN ME, HELPED ME THROUGH COLLEGE. WHAT ABOU YOUR REAL FAMILY? MY MOM WAS A STRIPPER... AND MY DAD WAS JUST SOME DUDE PASSING THROUGH DALLAS. I DID ASK HER ONCE, YOU KNOW [CHUCKLES] "WHY NOT JUST ABORT ME? IT'D HAVE BEEN EASIER." WHAT'D SHE SAY? JESUS TOLD HER NOT TO. DID SHE GO BACK TO STRIPPING AFTER YOU WERE BORN? NOT MUCH ELSE SHE COULD DO. SINGLE MOTHER, HIGH-SCHOOL DROPOUT -- WHAT ELSE IS THERE? THAT'S A TOUGH WAY TO RAISE A KID. THEN, WHEN I'M 8 YEARS OLD, AFTER A STRING OF ASSHOLE BOYFRIENDS, SHE MEETS DARNELL -- IN A.A., OF ALL PLACES. SHE WAS A DRUNK? HARD TO TAKE OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES FOR A BUNCH OF STRANGE MEN. WHAT STARTED OU AS MEDICINE FOR HER SHIF BECAME MEDICINE FOR LIFE. BUT SHE DECIDED TO GET HELP, THOUGH. [ CHUCKLES ] NO. NO. SHE GOT POPPED FOR HER THIRD D.U.I. IT WAS COURT-ORDERED A.A. AND... DARNELL WAS A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC SHE MET IN A.A.? NO. HE WAS THE FUCKING ANTICHRIST. NO, HE WAS THIS DRUG-PUSHING PIMP THAT LIKED TO HAWK N.A. AND A.A. MEETINGS, LOOKING FOR YOUNG GIRLS, YOUNG PROSPECTS, ONES THAT WERE TRYING TO GET HELP. YOU KNOW, ONES LOOKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES, EXCEPT HE WANTED TO INTRODUCE THEM TO A WORLD OF CRACK COCAINE AND DISGUSTING MEN. THIS IS EARLY '80s, SO NO ONE KNEW ABOUT CRACK COCAINE THEN. NO ONE KNEW HOW THAT SNAKE BIT, AND IT BIT MY MOM HARD. 'CAUSE SHE'D HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO DIE THE FIRST TIME SHE EVER STUCK THAT GLASS COCK IN HER MOUTH, BUT SHE DIDN'T. NO, THAT POISON JUST KILLED HER A LITTLE BIT EVERY DAY, BIT BY BIT, ROCK BY ROCK. THEN, ONE DAY, I'M 14 YEARS OLD, AND I COME HOME FROM SCHOOL, AND THERE'S 10 DUDES LINED UP TAKING TURNS ON MY MOM IN THE LIVING ROOM. DARNELL -- HE'S SITTING ON MY BEANBAG, EATING CHICKEN TENDERS, LOOKS UP AT ME AND SAYS, "HEY, LITTLE MAN, I GOT YOU A CHEESEBURGER, "BUT I ATE YOUR FRIES. I ATE YOUR FRIES." THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS. AND THEN MY -- I LOOKED DOWN, MY MOM'S GETTING RAMMED BY SOME FAT JHERI-CURL MOTHERFUCKER. SHE SAYS TO ME, "HEY, BABY, GET MY CRACK PIPE. GET ME MY CRACK PIPE." [ SCOFFS ] SO I DID. I WALKED OVER TO THE COUNTER, AND I GOT THE CRACK PIPE. I WALKED BACK OVER TO MY MAMA -- FAT FUCK, HE'S STILL GOING TO TOWN ON HER. I PUT IT IN HER MOUTH AND LIGHT IT, WATCH HER INGEST IT DEEP INSIDE, EYES ROLL IN THE BACK OF HER HEAD AS SHE JUST DRIFTS AWAY. [ INHALES DEEPLY ] AND THEN I PULLED OU A .38 PISTOL I STOLE FROM DARNELL'S HOUSE, AND I SHOT MY MOTHER RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, TURNED AROUND, SHOT THA FAT FUCK TWICE IN THE CHEST, AND OLD DARNELL LAUNCHES AT ME, AND I SHOOT THAT MOTHERFUCKER RIGHT IN THE MOUTH. COPS HAD TO PULL HIS TEETH OUT OF THE DRYWALL. GOD, IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD! BABY, I... I HAD NO IDEA. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS BEFORE? I COULD'VE HELPED YOU. WE COULD'VE GONE THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. SAM, YOU DID HELP ME. YOU'VE DONE NOTHING BUT LOVE ME. ME -- YOU GAVE ME THE GREATES GIFT IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD WITH OUR TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. I LET THIS HATE MANIFEST INSIDE OF ME. I LET EVIL WIN. NOT YOU. I DID THIS. BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO WIN TONIGHT. Woman: [ MUFFLED SHOUTING ] WE SHOULD GO CHECK ON HER, MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY. I'M GONNA BRING HER SOME WATER. NO. NO, I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. I WANT TO BRING HER SOME WATER. I WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY. WE ARE NOT GONNA HUR THIS GIRL. YEAH. YEAH, LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT, SIR, BUT -- I KNOW YOU NEED OUR CAPTAIN'S APPROVAL, SIR, BUT HE'S NOT AVAILABLE TO GIVE IT, AND WE NEED THOSE EXTRA SURVEILLANCE UNITS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE'VE LEFT WORD, AND SO HAS DISPATCH. [ SIGHS ] ALL RIGHT. LET ME KNOW. [ CELLPHONE BEEPS ] HE'S WORKING ON IT. YEAH, I'M SURE HE IS. WE GOT FOUR GIRLS WHO COME IN FROM PHILLY. TWO WORK STRIP CLUBS EVERY WEEKEND, AND TWO WORK HOTELS. RIGHT. AND ONE GIRL USES A SERVICE TO SET UP HER DATES ONLINE, AND SHE'S GO SOME REGULARS. NOW, OUR GIRL IN 115 SET UP HER DATE HERSELF. SHE DIDN'T -- SHE DIDN' USE THE SERVICE. RIGHT -- I MEAN, THE WEBSITE'S RUN BY THE SERVICE, BUT TONIGHT'S DATE, SHE... YEAH, SHE MADE THA HERSELF. AND IT DIDN'T BOTHER HER TO HAVE TO TRAVEL TO HIM? NO. WHY WOULD IT? SHE'S TRAVELED A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE WITH THE SERVICE. AND, YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE PROBABLY TIED IN A FEE, AS WELL. AND NONE OF THESE GIRLS KNOW EACH OTHER? WELL, THE GIRL IN 115 SAID SHE RECOGNIZED ONE OF THE GIRLS IN THE VAN, BUT SHE JUST WENT ON TO A CLUB DOWNTOWN. AND THE FRIEND THAT USUALLY TRAVELS WITH HER THIS TIME DID NOT. NOT TONIGHT, NO. SHE BOOKED A SEPARATE DATE AND LEFT BY TRAIN IN THE EARLY HOURS THIS MORNING. SHE SAY WHERE? YEAH, SHE DID. UM...NEWARK. IT'S STARTING TO MAKE A LITTLE SENSE. THESE GIRLS SEE JOBS POSTED ONLINE FOR A SHIT-TON OF MONEY FOR A NON-SEXUAL ENCOUNTER. AND "NON-SEXUAL ENCOUNTER" USUALLY MEANS NICE OLD MEN WHO CAN'T GET IT UP ANYMORE WHO'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY TO PAY FOR WOMEN BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUNG AND HOT. WHAT HARD-UP WORKING GIRL WOULD SAY NO? NOT MANY. BUT, OF COURSE, THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW EASY THEY'RE MAKING I FOR HIM. HE DAMN SURE KNOWS HOW HARD HE'S MAKING IT FOR US. YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT. [ SNIFFLES ] [ WHIMPERING ] [ INHALES DEEPLY ] [ PANTING ] OH, PLEASE, HELP ME. PLEASE, I GOT A KID. I HAVE A LITTLE BOY. PLEASE, DON'T HURT ME. Samantha: NO, NO, IT'S OKAY. PLEASE. IT'S OKAY. NO, NO, NOBODY'S GONNA HURT YOU, OKAY? MY -- MY WRISTS REALLY HURT. CAN YOU UNTIE ME? [ SNIFFLES ] YEAH, SURE. THANKS. [ PANTING ] Richard: STOP. NO. NO, SHE'S BEEN DOWN HERE FOR HOURS, AND HER WRISTS HURT. STOP DOING THAT. MISTER, PLEASE. I WON'T SAY A WORD. PLEASE. PLEA-- SHUT YOUR MOUTH BEFORE I SHUT IT FOR YOU. OH, NO, YOU WILL NOT. YOU ARE NO GONNA HURT THIS GIRL. LOOK AT ME, RICHARD. [ SNAPS FINGERS ] LOOK AT ME. NOT THIS ONE, OKAY? YOU'RE GONNA LE THIS ONE GO. NO. IF YOU LOVE OUR FAMILY, YOU HAVE TO LET HER GO. IT IS BECAUSE I LOVE OUR FAMILY THAT I WILL NOT LET HER GO. SHE'S NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING. I-I PROMISE. I-I-I'LL DISAPPEAR. YOU'LL NEVER HEAR FROM ME AGAIN. I'LL BE GONE. PLEASE, NO! PLEASE! [ WHIMPERING ] Shh! LOOK. HEY. HEY. LOOK AT ME. YOU KNOW SHE'LL TELL. WITHIN HOURS OF LETTING HER GO, THE COPS WILL KNOCK DOWN THAT DOOR AND TAKE ME AWAY FOREVER. YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEND WHAT SAVINGS WE HAVE TO KEEP ME OFF DEATH ROW. YOU'LL HAVE TO SELL THIS HOUSE, EVERYTHING WE OWN, CHANGE YOUR NAME, MOVE AWAY. EVERYTHING WE'VE BUILT, ALL THAT WE HAVE, WILL BE GONE HOURS AFTER I LET HER GO. [ Voice breaking ] SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT THE ONLY OPTION WE HAVE IS TO KILL HER? THE ONLY OPTION I HAVE IS TO KILL HER. HOW DO YOU PLAN ON DOING IT, HUH? HOW DO YOU KILL THEM? HOW WERE YOU PLANNING ON... DISPOSING OF HER BODY BEFORE I GOT HOME? TELL ME THAT, MY LOVE... MY WONDERFUL HUSBAND... ...MY BEST FRIEND. I'M GOING TO STRANGLE HER WITH A BELT. I'LL THEN TAKE HER BODY TO THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY, RUN HER THROUGH THE WOOD CHIPPER. THEN I'LL COLLEC WHAT'S LEFT OF HER, PLACE I INTO A GARBAGE BAG, AND LATER, WHEN I GO TO PICK UP THE KIDS, I'LL THROW IT IN A DUMPSTER BEHIND D.J.'s PIZZA. [ SOBS, SNIFFLES ] YOU ARE NOT THIS PERSON. I'VE LOVED YOU MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE, AND... AND THIS ISN'T YOU. THE MAN I LOVE... THE MAN WHO LOVES ME... ...HE WOULDN'T THINK THESE THINGS. HE WOULDN'T... HE WOULDN'T DO THESE HORRIBLE THINGS. WE ALL HAVE A DARK SIDE. YOU'RE JUST NOW SEEING MINE. I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU, BUT YOU GOT TO HELP YOURSELF. NO, I WARNED YOU IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS IF YOU GOT CARRIED AWAY WITH THIS SHIT. ARE YOU EVEN FUCKING LISTENING TO ME?! MONICA -- NO, DON'T DO THAT. NO, DON'T DO IT. DON'T BE SO FUCKING STUPID. DON'T DO IT. FUCK! [ CLATTERING ] [ SIGHS ] [ SIGHS ] [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE. HOW LONG HAS THA BEEN AN ISSUE? [ SCOFFS ] WHAT? I THOUGHT WE SAID WE WERE GONNA CUT THE SHIT. [ SIGHS ] A WHILE NOW. THAT'S WHY YOU LEF NARCOTICS? SHE GOT LOCKED UP IN THAT WHOLE PHARMACY MESS, AND NO ONE REALLY WANTED TO TRUST ME AFTER THAT. THEY FIGURED YOUR WIFE'S ON DOPE, SO YOU MUST BE, AS WELL -- THAT IT? [ SIGHS ] I GUESS SO. ARE YOU? [ SCOFFS ] ARE YOU STILL FUCKING YOUR INFORMANTS? NOT SINCE I MARRIED ONE. I'M SORRY. THAT WAS OUT OF LINE. I KNOW IT WAS. I'M SORRY. THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED TO PARTNER WITH ME, ISN'T IT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU FIGURED I'D KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WALK IN YOUR SHOES A LITTLE. I'D GIVE YOU ROOM, NOT ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS OR JUDGE TOO HARSHLY. [ CHUCKLES ] IF I WERE IN YOUR SHOES... ...I'D HAVE DONE THE SAME THING. [ SIGHS ] EVERYBODY HAS SECRETS. EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES. IT'S HOW WE DEAL WITH THEM THAT DETERMINES WHO WE ARE. THE KEY IS TO LIMI MISTAKES OF CHARACTER. AND AS THE ONE MAN I KNOW WHO WALKED THIS EARTH SIN-FREE ONCE SAID, "DON'T JUDGE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE JUDGED." I WON'T JUDGE YOU. WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH... I ASKED IF I COULD PARTNER WITH YOU BECAUSE I HEARD YOU WERE THE BEST DETECTIVE THERE WAS. CAPTAIN WANTS TO PULL ME OFF THE CASE. SAYS I'M MAKING IT PERSONAL. ARE YOU? I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY BEHIND MY BACK, AND I DON'T CARE WHAT THE CAPTAIN THINKS. MY WIFE WAS MY INFORMANT. SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE. I KNEW RIGHT AWAY SHE DIDN'T WANT THAT LIFE. SHE WAS NEW TO THIS COUNTRY, COULD BARELY SPEAK THE LANGUAGE, HAD NO JOB SKILLS. SHE NEEDED HELP. WE BECAME FRIENDS, AND WE FELL IN LOVE, AND I'M NOT ASHAMED TO ADMIT THAT. I'M NOT ASHAMED ONE BIT. WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 10 YEARS. WE'VE GOT THREE BEAUTIFUL KIDS. AND SHE GETS ME. [ CHUCKLES ] SHE GETS ME. [ SIGHS ] SO, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT. IT IS PERSONAL. NO ONE DESERVES WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THESE GIRLS. NO ONE. YOU KNOW THIS IS WRONG, RIGHT? I NEVER SAID IT WAS RIGHT... BUT IT'S JUST. [ SCOFFS ] NO, LOVE IS JUST. LOVE CAN'T MAKE SOMEONE CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE. MAYBE NOT. BUT IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE ENOUGH, MAYBE THEY'LL WANT TO CHANGE. I LOVED MY MOM MORE THAN ANYTHING. SOMEONE'S LOVED THESE GIRLS. THAT'S NOT WHAT MAKES THEM CHOOSE THE LIFESTYLE. THEY CHOOSE I BECAUSE THEY ARE WEAK. WELL... WELL, MAYBE, IF YOU LET HER GO... ...AND SHE SEES YOUR KINDNESS AND TRUST... ...IT'LL CHANGE HER LIFE. MAYBE SHE'LL BECOME STRONG. AND MAYBE SHE'LL DECIDE TO CHANGE WHO SHE IS. AND MAYBE SHE GOES TO THE COPS, AND WE LOSE IT ALL. NO. NO. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL. IS IT WORTH THE RISK? AT THE END OF THE DAY, IS SHE WORTH THE RISK -- TO LOSE EVERYTHING BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE SHE'S GONNA CHANGE WHAT SHE IS? SHE'S A WHORE, AND SHE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A WHORE. DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. YOU DON'T THINK HAVING HER DOWN HERE, PLANNING TO DO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO TO HER IS ENOUGH? YOU GOT TO THROW INSULTS AT HER? YOU DON'T THINK SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS? YOU THINK, AS SHE SITS HERE... ...AND SHE LISTENS TO THAT GARBAGE, SHE'S FORGETTING WHAT GOT HER HERE? NOT FOR ONE SECOND. I BET SHE HASN' STOPPED THINKING ABOUT IT. I BET YOU THAT, AS SHE SITS HERE, AND SHE PRAYS TO A GOD SHE MAY OR MAY NOT BELIEVE IN... TO SPARE HER LIFE SO SHE CAN GET BACK TO HER LITTLE BOY. SHE'S PROMISING HIM THA SHE'S GONNA CHANGE HER LIFE... ...AND SHE'S GONNA GET OFF THE STREETS... ...AND SHE'S GONNA GET OFF THE DRUGS. SHE'S GONNA TURN HER LIFE AROUND. I BET YOU... THAT SHE HAS MADE JUST ABOU EVERY PROMISE THAT THERE IS. HAVEN'T YOU? [ SNIFFLES ] I KNOW YOU HAVE. 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR THE SAME THING. DON'T YOU SIT THERE AND TELL ME THAT THIS GIRL'S GONNA GO TO THE POLICE. NO, PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT TO THE LIGH IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. [ CHUCKLES ] MAYBE -- MAYBE THE BLESSING IN DISGUISE HERE IS THAT, UH -- IS THAT YOU BROUGHT HER TO THE LIGHT... THAT WE'VE, TOGETHER, LED HER TO THE LIGHT. Richard: YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

IN THE STORE, WE SEE HER BUYING SOME CIGARETTES, AND THEN WHEN SHE EXITS, INSTEAD OF WALKING TOWARDS THE BUS STATION, SHE WALKS AROUND THE CORNER TO THE BACK ALLEY OF THE STORE. OKAY. I WANT YOU TO CALL THE PHONE COMPANY AND HAVE THEM PULL ALL INCOMING CALLS TO THAT PAY PHONE. OKAY, YOU MEAN OUTGOING. I MEAN INCOMING. HE CALLED HER, TOLD HER TO CROSS THE STREE SO HE COULD SPOT SURVEILLANCE. THE SON OF A BITCH KNEW THERE WERE CAMERAS IN BOTH PLACES. MULTIPLE GIRLS, MULTIPLE LOCATIONS, MULTIPLE PRECAUTIONS.

LIKE HOW HE KILLS THEM DIFFERENT WAYS. AND DISPOSES OF THE BODIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. HE STABS A FEW. HE STRANGLES A FEW. HE BURNS A FEW. HE DROWNS A FEW IN THE OCEAN. ALL OF THIS JUST STOPS US MAKING A PROFILE ON HIM. AND TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE KILLERS. I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT... SOUNDS LIKE HE'S A COP. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] YEP? OKAY. GOOD.
