You need this to get excited? Come on! And you? What do you need? Don't let up on him! Left! Give him the left! Hey! I'll make a bet. - How much? -Five bucks. Hey, my friend... Why you wanna bother me when I'm drunk? Hurry up! At your service, Mr. Bradley. Okay, Chuan. What time do we get to Kan Koy? Before dark. Why'd you choose this job? I always see new faces. And it's not tiring, being a guide. Let them pass! You don't hear them? Eat my dust! You know who that idiot driver is? My father! You're good, Chuan! Take care of the rickshaw. I hope I'll be finished in a week and can go back. Sorry... Another two dollars for the parking lot attendant. Take it. Some advice... Stay on the main river. Don't take side streams. Could be dangerous. Okay, okay, don't worry. By the way... You know how to keep your mouth shut? If anyone asks you about me... You've never seen me, right? Sure! It's good. What kind of fish is it? We're in luck. It was pregnant. There were fish eggs. But what is it? Swamp snake. Drink. You'll need a shot of whiskey after this shit. Good disinfectant. Damn! Too strong! I'm tired. I'm going to sleep. Remember to put out the fire. Try to rest. We've got a hard day coming up. I'm beginning to miss Europe. Yes, Mr. Bradley? Thanks. I've noticed there aren't any more villages around here. We've gone too far, Mr. Bradley. I don't know this area. We better get going. I feel nervous. Come on, don't worry. Tomorrow we'll be done and we'll go back. I'm gonna rest now and then go for another dive. I want to see if I can get a picture of those fluorescent fish. Would it bother you if I played the flute? I'm not sleepy tonight. Chuan... You know how far London is? Ten thousand kilometers... Ten thousand kilometers of land and sea... Is London like Bangkok, Mr. Bradley? No, it's different. Completely different. But it's got its attractions... It's cold... There's the fog... What's fog, Mr. Bradley? Fog is like smoke... Dense, gray... It's like being in a ghost city... You walk streets that all seem the same. There's the light of streetlights... Asleep, Mr. Bradley? Chuan! Chuan!... Where'd you go off to? Chuan! Tie him up! Quick! Lahun... They caught a fish-man, a big one! Tie him to the pole! Let everyone see... Let it serve as an example to the other cannibals! Bring them here! Have pity! You don't deserve pity! You're animals! Tuan! Hurry, hold them! Stop! Murderers! Stop! Maray! Maray! Take him down! He's a fish-man who lives in the deep parts of the river. He could be dangerous. He's not a fish-man. He's just a man. He can work, father. I want him as a slave. Come on, fish, come on! Go under! Under! Come on, fish-man! Enough! I've had enough! Stop! Leave him alone! You belong to me now. Come out! Thank you, father! When will this nightmare end? What do they want from me? They think I'm a kind of fish because of the wetsuit? If I could at least communicate with them... This unbearable stench... You're beautiful, Maray. Let me out! I can't take it anymore! Let me go! I want to get out! I'm a man! A man like you! Tuan! Tuan! Make him work in the water! Naked! Eat. It's good. I'm telling you, it's good! Go away! You... American? My God! You speak my language? Quiet! You listen! Me little girl... Missionaries in my tribe teach me your language... I found in jungle... Village not know I help you... I set you free today. Feast of the sun. Maray will be a bride in ten moons... Today you don't work. Feast of the sun. Untie him! Stop! I'm here! Don't go! Don't leave me here! Karen, stop! You can't kill him, he belongs to me! Go away! If there's a helicopter, there must be a white village near. I have to escape, or I'll go crazy... You sick... Listen, help me to escape. Not now. When you get better, strong. Karen no good. Maray very sad, marry before the rains... Please help me. Get me a canoe. Along the river... Over the mountains... big danger... the Kuru are fierce Cannibals... You can't make it alone. A month's gone by... A month of hell. The wedding hut's finished and I haven't been able to talk to the old governess. Only she can help me. Why doesn't she show herself? What could have happened to her? This is old tribal rite. From now on she doesn't belong to the dead man. The woman is free now. If you want to escape it's a good time... Karen not here... Go! Quick! Karen! The fish-man got away! Quick! Follow me! Hurry! Over here! Hurry! Stop! He's mine! Here! Stop! He won... don't kill him. I didn't make it. It's all over... I'm sorry. Take him away. He's under arrest... But don't hurt him. He's won. Rest, Karen. Rest... In three moons you'll be a warrior. Resist, Maray wants you to. Little arrows... Great pain... you must not die... I can't take anymore... And it's only the first day... How can I get through this? My wounds are killing me... The sun's blinding... But I musn't fall asleep... I can't... If I sleep I'm done for... My throat's burning... I'm so thirsty... thirsty... Maray, I'm thirsty... Go away! Thai! Thai! Come on, eat... go ahead... This sword is yours... along with the strength of the warriors. You've now earned wisdom. Thai! The little's boy's ill! He's suffocating! Run, quick! Diptheria... It's very serious... There's no time to lose. No! It's the evil spirits. Lahuna, send him away! He's dying, Lahuna. We've got to save him before it's too late! Hold him tight. Today's an important day for our village. One of you will become my daughter's groom... This necklace is a token of my affection... I'm sure you'll be worthy of it. Now go. My daughter is yours. Let her be fertile. Let her be fertile... Bradley! We've got it! The net! Are you tired? You're more beautiful like this. My man... I loves you... I LO VE you. No, Maray. You think you love me. But you don't know what love means yet. You're doing better, eh? Sit down. I have to tell you something very important. All of us feel great joy today... Maray's pregnant. Baby... The sorcerer... he said he'll be strong... A son! My little savage! You must break... It brings good luck. Maray! What's the matter? You feel ill? Don't worry... It's normal. I feel better now... Much better. Six months have gone by. Day after day of a new life I hadn't thought possible. Civilization... my job... London... the world... ...it's all so far away, useless and strange. Now my world is this faraway village. My reason for living is Maray and the son I'll have with her. A son! He'll need me, his father. He'll be a little rebellious savage. Like you! She's yours! I come from this country... here's my city. What's a city? A city's like a great village, full of tall huts that reach the sky... The streets are made of hard earth and there are lots of cars... Cars? - Yes, there're carts that make noise... But this is too hard for you. Once more: Repeat. London... Woman... Man... Baby... Our baby! What happened? Cannibals... The Kuru... Don't move. Bradley... my head... such pain inside... I can't see anymore... Thai! Take her to the village. She's ill. Hurry! Come with me... Let's go! Quick! Prepare to die! Your tongue! Hold still! Thai... Bradley... Where are you? I'm here, Maray. How do you feel? My eyes... It hurts inside... Don't be afraid. You're weak... It's just a condition... You're due in just a little while... It's all dark! I can't see anything anymore! Don't worry. You're just tired... you'll feel better tomorrow. Sleep... Don't think about anything... I'm here nearby... I won't leave you. Hurry! We don't have much time! I have to make it, Taima. I have to reach a large city... It's the only way to save her. When you arrive great river... Follow current south... You will find village. Hurry, go. I thank you with all my heart, Taima. No! Don't kill me! On your knees! You must die! Kill her! It's not your decision. I'm the one who makes the decisions. No, have pity... I beg you to let me live... No, I beg you... Are you tired? No, I'm fine. Elephants! Hold on tight! Let's land. It's no use anymore... Capture them! What's the river like? Tell me what you see. There are children playing in the water... There's Mihuan fishing from his boat. Have the Marabu already flown away? The last ones are flying away now. Stay still... don't move. A white butterfly's landed on your belly. Is it still there? Yes, it's there. They're the last butterflies... The rains are coming... and our son with them. It was the last time I brought Maray to the river. She didn't get up again. Her illness got worse... I was desperate. After the last attempt to bring her to Bangkok... I could no longer do anything for her... The tribe didn't allow it. Maray had to die. Get out! You too... Out! The baby... has to be born... My head... feels so bad inside... The labor is delayed... The baby is suffering... What can we do? Are you suffering a lot? No... Don't worry... There's a butterfly... What color is it? Black. What's it mean? Death! What's our son like? -Beautiful. He's beautiful like his mother. We'll bring him to the river to fish... And you'll play with him in the flowers... You must take care of our son... The spirit of death is carrying me away... You'll get better. In a few days you'll see our son with your own eyes. I promise. We'll be happy together. I'll be carried away by the wind... but the wind will bring me back to you... Please, help our people... They need you. Father... I want to be united with this man forever... Come! There's no danger. It's gone. Go back to work... We must rebuild the village...
