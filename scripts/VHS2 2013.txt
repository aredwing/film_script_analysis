Yeah, so you're watching that footage I sent? Yeah, I'm looking, son, and you... So as you probably guessed, your wife hired me to get that. The problem is if I show it to her, she stops paying me. So I was thinking you might want to make a counter-Offer there. Oh, and whatever number you come up with, You can put 300 bucks on top for the dent you put in my car. Well, you scratched the paint anyway. You know what, if I don't hear from you by tomorrow, Your wife gets that file. Good-Bye. So what's the deal now? Ah, probably nothing. Just this woman thinks. Her son is missing. He hasn't been to class in a week. He won't answer her calls. He's probably passed out in a pile of beer cans. In which case we're gonna take the kid on a road trip. And rack up some expenses, 'cause we're getting 1,000 bucks a day on this one. Turn left up here. Your button cam's working? Yeah, it's working. This is it? Yeah. It doesn't look like anyone's home. She couldn't give you a key? She doesn't have one. She said the lock. On the back window's busted, So maybe we can get in that way. And the cops haven't been here? No, the cops don't give a shit about some college kid. Who's missing for a couple days. Here. Is there someone in there? Here. Come on, give me the cam. There's nothing there. It sure as fuck sounded like there's something there. It's an old house. Besides, if there is somebody in there, I'm gonna want to talk to 'em. Here. You all right? Just great. Ow. You okay? Huh. - Um... - What? You know what? Stay in here, okay? I'm gonna go check the rest of this apartment. And make sure no one else is in here, okay? - You got your gun? - Yeah. All right, good. Just... Just, um, Pull anything relevant onto that drive. Okay? And record everything. That was part of the deal. She likes me to do that. Well, you took my camera. Oh. Then... all right, so I'll be right back. Just, um... Just, I don't know, See what's on that computer, okay? If it's encrypted, we can take it home. If not, just pull what you can. Got it. Show her tits! I found a new one. It's third or fourth generation from the quality. I got it from some guy down in little Armenia. With a pawn shop. He is definitely not the type of guy you usually see. On here trading with us, but I think he's somebody. Who's worth checking in on again. Okay. That's fucking weird. Most of his collection, I would say, Was snuff and cp, but he had at least one. That was the real thing. I don't even think he knew what it was. Anyway... A little bit of redness, some irritation, But it looks okay. How's it working? It's good. Yeah, I can see, But what about my other eye? - Follow. - Okay. You can't see anything out of your biological eye? No. Okay. How about now? Yeah. I mean, it's a little better. It's just kind of blurry and shadowy. Yeah. All right. Well, because your prosthesis is attached directly. To your visual cortex, You real eye's essentially battling with your camera eye. To give you input right now. So when your brain gets used to having that chip in there, You should start to see more and more. Out of your uninjured eye again. Until then, you might see some glitches. What do you mean by glitches? Well, this is just being tested now. Eye injuries like yours are quite rare. So that's why we've installed a recording chip. Into the eye itself so we can test the data it's receiving. Right. Yeah, about that. - Yes? - Oh, my god. So if I want private time, what do I do? - How do I turn this off? - Well, you can't. But that's just for this trial period. You can't expect the KPG corporation to just. Give you this implant and not expect to test its data. Of course not. So you guys are gonna sit around and watch me take shits? I'd say that's a fair compromise, Mr. Middleton. You can read a newspaper during, or something. Mm-Hmm. So make an appointment for next week. We'll see how it's working. Call me if you have any concerns. All right. Thank you. What the hell? - All right, man. - All right. You sure you gonna be okay, bud? Yeah, dude, I'm good. I'm good. Give me a shout if you need anything. See ya. What the fuck? Where'd I put that controller? All righty, then. What the... Okay. What the fuck? Hello? Hello? Oh, come on. What the fuck is this shit? Oh, shit. Jesus! Fuck! Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah, I can tell the difference. Between a burst of light and a fucking bloody person, okay? I don't know, you tell me. You're the doctor. Look, I'm coming in there tomorrow, and you're gonna fix. This fucking thing, and that's that, okay? Fine. All right, thank you. Hello? Is somebody down there? Seriously, don't fuck with me. Oh, god damn it. Hello? Shit! Oh, fuck. What the fuck? Hello? Shit! Uh, okay! I'm good. Thank you, you can go. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Oh, my god. God damn it. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Hey, are you in there? Look, I can see you through the peephole. Weren't you at the doctor's office yesterday? Yeah. Okay, so what's the deal? Are you following me? I'm not following you. Look, just open the door. All right, listen, I don't mean to be rude, But it's kind of weird, you know? Look, are you seeing weird stuff? Like people who look dead? You should really open the door. Thank you. I'm Clarisse. Yeah, come on in. - Nice place, man. - Thanks. Do you have any beer? I do. Yes. What about painkillers? Did the doctor give you any? No, I'm not actually in any pain. I'll just take a beer then. Look, Clarisse, I'm actually on my way out of here. Dude, you're not gonna get anywhere. If you don't hear what I have to say. Just give me a beer, get one for yourself. You're gonna need it. Right. - Thanks. - Sure. I was born deaf. When I was 16, my parents put me up. For a new cochlear implant. It worked, obviously. But I began to be able to pick up. Certain frequencies in my environments. What happened to your eye anyway? I was in a, um... In a car accident. So who's the little girl? What little girl? There's a little girl here. I heard her crying when I came in. But you know... I don't hear her now. Some people never hear them or see them. Maybe once in their entire lives, If they're open to it. So when you can sense them, they know. They can tell. That's why I wanted to find you. To warn you. Warn me about what? Yeah. The more you interact with them, The more they can touch you, Hurt you, stuff. Well, tomorrow I'm gonna get this fuckin' thing. Taken out of my head, and that'll be that, right? Don't be so sure. Have you ever done anything bad to anybody? Look, if you get the implant taken out, They're still gonna be there. You're just not gonna be able to see them. I don't know, maybe that's better. Well, I guess. Oh, shit! Um, I don't want to alarm you right now, But there's a fucking creepy dude standing right behind you. I know. I can hear him. - Do you know him or something? - He was my uncle. Oh, of course, right. I mean... Well, I didn't mean to call him creepy, but I mean... He wasn't a nice person. Okay... Listen, I know how to make him go away. - Just focus on me. - Okay. Oh! Oh, shit. No, don't look at him, look at me. Oh, shit. All right, you scientist assholes, I want a copy of that footage. Like, I want you to put it on a disc or something, But don't watch it. Just get it to me, okay? All right. Oh, fuck. Oh, god damn it. Clarissa... is that you? Hey. Oh, shit! Hey. Oh, god. Oh, shit. What the fuck? Clarissa, give me your hand! Fuck. I got you. I got you. Oh, fuck! Oh... oh... oh... oh... all right. You're coming out of here, you fucker. Eww... oh, I can't look at this shit. Oh, god. Okay. Oh, shit! Larry. Larry! Hey, keep your voice down. What? - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just watched something really weird. It couldn't have been real, so... Okay. Is there anything on that computer? I'm cloning his hard drive now. It shouldn't take too long. Here, look at this. Tape is the final link for me. I know a lot of you have posted that it only affects you. If you play it in a correct sequence. But I've been experimenting on... Is this the kid? Yeah, that's him. I found some notebooks in his room. Kind of like journals. Mostly just nonsense, though. I'm going through them right now. Why don't you, like, keep looking at these tapes? Kid's a collector. I don't know. Who knows? Maybe there's something relevant on them. Oh. Um... okay. We're all just electromagnetic energy, Then these analog tapes capturing images. Of the supernatural, They can affect our cerebral cortex. They... They... Hey, babe. Don't "hey, babe" me, mike Sullivan. We're supposed to be having breakfast. Yeah, but it's a beautiful day. I just want to take the bike out for a spin. I wanted you to take me for a spin. You know, you ride that bike more than you ride me. Yeah, but you know the bike is just a physical thing, babe. Mm-Hmm. Now, tell me you love me. I love you. Okay, good enough. Be safe, babe. All right, bye. Help me! Please! - Are you okay? - My boyfriend! You have to help my boyfriend! - Aah! - I'm getting help. No, please! Help Dan! Oh, god! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, stay with me. Shit! Fuck! God. Who's there?

Help! Unh! Honey, you sure you know where you're going? This does not look like a trail. Of course I know where I'm going. - Trust me. - How can you tell? - Well, it used to be a trail. - There's no trail here. This doesn't look familiar to you at all? No, not whatsoever. I mean it's pretty, I'll give you that much. Holy shit. Oh, my god. Is he... I think so. It looks like he's been bit by something. Will you check his pulse, just to be sure? Nothing. My god, I mean, what could have done this? I don't know. I don't know. - An animal? - Yes, hello. We found someone. He's, like, covered in blood, And there's no pulse. We're on the bike trails and...

Yeah, we're at gold stone state park. But I'm not sure, exactly, where we are here. It's the... The trail off of highway one.
