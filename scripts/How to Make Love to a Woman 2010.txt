I need forepIay. You do? Yeah. Why have you never brought this up before? It just never came up in conversation. So, aII that time was. . . . It was okay. So, just okay? Pretty decent. That is worse than okay. No. No, no, no. No, no. See, decent is definiteIy a IittIe bit better than okay. And then pretty decent is just a IittIe Iess decent than that. No, there's a scaIe.

So, it was more Iike-- [ Sighs with disappointment ] Yeah. What's the probIem? I don't think it's reaIIy a probIem. I just need to make a few adjustments. My ex, Tricia, it took Iike two minutes. I couId give her a piggyback ride to the car and she'd be done. Lauren takes a Iot Ionger. How much Ionger? I don't know. WeII, guesstimate. No, reaIIy, I don't know. Wait. How Iong have you two been going out? A year. A year?! An entire year and nothing? Are you kidding me, Andy? A year? I mean, a year's a reaIIy Iong time to not even-- Okay, yeah, I get it. Thank you, Nomi. I'm just saying, Iike, you couId reaIIy get benched for something Iike that. Hey, Andy, what is up? Andy can't satisfy his girIfriend. Ooh, what's the probIem? I wouIdn't caII it a probIem, per se. Oh, honey, you better Iearn, 'cause nobody gets back into the game once they've been benched. Yeah, weII, I didn't even know what the score was untiI just Iast night. Nomi, give me some pointers. No, that's weird. I don't know what I'm doing here, obviousIy. You must know a thing or two. Come on, spiII the beans. This is cIearIy very important. I'm not a sexpert here, Andy, so. . . Do you forepIay? I pIay every time. How much pIay? How much? Yeah, you know, quantify in minutes. Three or four. [ Laughs ] Three or four? Andy Conners, you are definiteIy not satisfying your girIfriend. Okay, Nancy. So, how much is enough? You need to go at Ieast 1 5. Yeah, you know, depending on what type. And what's the best type? You need to educate yourseIf on aII the reIevant methods and techniques. How wouId I go about this? Don't Iook at me. -Hi. -Hey there. How'd it go Iast night? Last night was good. . . when he finaIIy got there. [ Groans ] Okay, weII, what about after dinner? Did he Iike the Iingerie? Yeah. Okay, weII, was the sex good? Yeah. Hey, mysterious, you wanna fiII me in here? It was your one-year, right? Yep. Okay. WeII, is he the one? He couId be. You're not sure?

What's on this Iist? Okay, weII, everyone's Iist is different, right? I mean, wouIdn't you say, CarIa? Yeah, you start with the basics. So, Iike, I want someone who hears me, not just Iistens, but actuaIIy gets what I'm saying. Right. Or Iike, does he appreciate me? Is he romantic? Does he drain your souI with empty promises and seIf-serving priorities? Okay, that's a different Iist. It's about the smaII things, okay? Like, does he open doors for you? Does he kiss you goodnight? Does he not cheat on you with your shift manager who's onIy moderateIy better Iooking than you? -I hate men. -Right. Not so heIpfuI, right? Maybe not? Let's keep it Iight. The most important thing of aII, as you aIready know, does he get you to OrIando? Oh, my God! You are so bad! I can't beIieve you just said that! -I did. I did. -You're such a dork. No, it never happened! I've never been there. And he is aIways there. You know, whatever. I don't even care. So, Lauren, is Andy, Iike, a sex train with precious cargo? Oh, come on, don't Ieave us hangin'. I bet he is. Mm-hmm. What is my body worth? Was there a price set before? There's something greater there What is my body worth?

No. It's up aII the time. I dry toweIs on it. -Oh, so it's Iike an endurance thing? -No. Yeah. Sometimes. Why, do you know something about this? Me? No, no, man. It's a common probIem though, you know? I mean, I couId go, Iike, two or three days without food or water. Nothing. Andy, don't sweat it, man. I'm a two-pump chump, too. What you gotta do is think about puppies and WaIter Matthau. You'II Iast for a week. You won't be abIe to finish. Wait, wait, you don't think about sex when you're having sex? I have a boner 2 4 hours a day. What am I supposed to do when I Iook down and there's this beautifuI, moaning, naked woman beIow me? Andy, good Iuck, man. We're gonna head out. This crowd is probabIy gonna start a riot soon. [ Cheering and appIause ] I wouId Iike to dedicate this to a buddy of mine who can't quite seem to take his girIfriend aII the way in bed. I think you can do it, Andy. Andy! CROWD: Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Dude, you're famous. [ Truck horn honks ] Dude, you drive Iike a girI. I do not drive Iike a girI. I drive the speed Iimit. -I don't wanna get a ticket. -You don't wanna get a ticket? Do you have any idea how expensive insurance is? -You have reaIIy Iost your edge. -What is that supposed to mean? It means you've gone soft, sof-t. I guess that's what happens when you get a girIfriend. Shit. Is that why you're stiII singIe? You're afraid to Iose your edge? As a matter of fact, that's exactIy why I'm stiII singIe. I Iike to keep my edge extra edgy, sIice your motherfuckin' head off. You feeI me? Shit, man, men are not supposed to be monogamous, man. We're supposed to be chiIIin'. We're supposed to be out in the fieId, puIIing our dicks out, spreading our seed as far, as wide as possibIe, Iike a fire hydrant. So gross. You're so gross. Whatever. AND Y: There she is. Nomi, get your ass in the car. Nomi. Nomi? Nomi, what-- what-- Who's that? -Put your pedaI down for the gas. -Who's he? -Get me out of here. -Wait, wait. What the fuck?

This crazy Internet promotions party. Yeah, Andy needs to find some sexperts. Yes, and it wouId be a pretty good idea for you to meet some of these peopIe. And we fade out as the soundtrack sings You're like a black cat With a black backpack full of fireworks And you're gonna burn the city down right now Whoa Whoa You're like a black cat With a black backpack full of fireworks Let's do this. I need a drink. You guys handIe the sex peopIe. [ Scoffs ] Nah. Ew. Nope. Dork. Ooh, porn stars. Come on. ...way too tragic [ ChuckIes ] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So, what is your probIem? I wouId say it's more strategy than anything eIse. No, he can't get his girIfriend off. I mean, at aII. However, recent concerns have come to Iight, and I genuineIy fear that my days may be numbered. My girIfriend is my whoIe Iife, though. And I don't even think she knows it. Aw, that's so sweet. Why don't you waIk us through your steps. -Beginning to end. -Okay. WeII, first we kiss. Then I touch her. . . boobs. Then I kiss her. . . boobs. For how Iong? I don't know, Iike, probabIy a coupIe minutes per boob. Go on. Then we'II get naked, and we kiss some more. And I'II touch her in her. . . speciaI pIace. And then we do it. For how Iong? At Ieast five or six minutes. Five? PIease. And at the end, does she ever, you know, Iike-- [ Moans ] No. No? And that's the probIem. Your first mistake is you don't spend enough time kissing. SensuaI kissing is very important in making Iove to a woman. Huh. Dude, I am getting a serious notorious B-I-G in my pants. Don't Iet her undress herseIf, you know. God, women absoIuteIy Iove to be undressed. -So, do it sIow. -Oh. Do everything sIow.

Some awesome bands pIaying tonight, huh? Yeah. Wow. [ Scoffs ] What-- Thank you, garon. Ladies. -So, what's the best position? -No, no, no. What's the best sequence of positions, you know? The key to making Iove to a woman is not the positions, it's the cIitoris, it's the hot button to a woman, it's the eweI. The diamond, rarr! You guys know where to find the diamond, right? [ Laughs ] Yeah. Of course we do. What do we Iook Iike, cavemen? MAN: You smeII Iike sex. Are you sure you know how to kiss? Are you out of your fuckin' mind? That's the one thing I do know how to do well. -Then prove it. -What? Yeah, Layne. Prove it. You are my brother for Iife. I'm doin' this for you. -Make me proud. -Yes sir. WeII, weII, weII, weII, weII. WeII, weII, weII. Eeny, meeny, miney, moe, Iet me start the fires. God damn it. NOMI: Whoo-hoo! [ Crash ] Oh, yeah. MAN: Is her arm broken? [ Moaning ] Oh.

That was great. Right, didn't you think? Yeah. [ ChuckIes ] [ Sighs ] Rose has a great body. You know, she's got the ass, the Iegs, the boobs. Oh, I Iove those breasts. Ow. You know, they're Iike unicorns. You know, just unreaI. But so reaI. A woman's body has a Iot of erogenous zones. What do you mean? It means that I'm sensitive in more pIaces on my body than just my breasts. Oh. WeII, I knew that. Come on, baby. My neck, the smaII of my back, and on the sides of my hips right there by the V. That's my favorite. My knees, my wrists. And that IittIe pIace between my thighs. INTERVIEWER: And how often do you orgasm? -Um, sometimes. -AIways. Sometimes? AII the time. Thank you. That's more Iike it. I masturbate when I'm aIone. What? God, can you feeI my muscIes getting bigger? I can see your muscIes. I can see your muscIes growing. You seem angry. Are you okay? You happy? Yes, of course I'm happy. It's just, you know, sometimes Andy can be a IittIe-- -EmotionaIIy unsatisfying? -Yes. I mean, no. Am I a terribIe person? No, you're not a terribIe person. Lauren, it's how you feeI. I mean, the important thing's you Iove this guy, right? Right. DoubIe punch! Jesus Christ. And that IittIe dick Ioves you, right? Right. I think.

AII right, here we go. -She's not sure, man. -Just focus on that. Pretend that's your dad. Listen, okay, first of aII, you don't even think this guy's the one. You said it. And second of aII, you're not even sure if he Ioves you. Let me give him a fist rocket to the face, pIease. Okay, weII, Iet's just say, for argument's sake, that maybe I have one or two doubts. Or two, okay. -What wouId I do to get rid of them? -Fist rocket! [ Screams ] Fuck! I swore. First, you gotta go out with someone as a test. Yeah, yeah, yeah, someone with a bunch of money. DoubIe punch! Someone you couId theoreticaIIy see yourseIf dating or marrying. That is terribIe! It's not even terribIe. I'm not asking you to bone this guy. Bone the guy. Who are you kidding?

Everything you do is great. Oh, thanks. Which is why I'm promoting you to the director of the Chicago office. Boom. [ Gasps ] Oh, my God. I don't even know what to say. Yes. Yes. Big raise, company car, and you'II be on the fast track to partner. What do you say? Can I have a few days to think about it? [ Groans ] Ooh, Lauren, w-- [ Laughs ] I'm just kidding. You have two days. But off the record, for a woman your age, this is the chance of a Iifetime. Thank you. And you didn't have to sIeep with anyone. Hey, DanieI. -He's the cooIest. -Curtis. What's up, D-dog? [ Barks ] Oh, man. Love this guy. Lauren, meet DanieI. He's here for the week. -Lauren? -Oh, my God. Danny MeItzer, are you kidding me? You know each other? Our parents are friends in Irvine. We practicaIIy grew up together. How are you? Oh, my goodness. Hi. I aIways wonder what happened to you. You Iook. . . thinner. -You Iook amazing. -Thank you. Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since you Ieft for coIIege. I was in the 8th grade, and my heart was broken. Aw. We shouId catch up. Let's go get a drink. I wouId Iove to. Dinner is on me. Okay. Focus, pIease? AII right. You two might see more of each other, aII right? DanieI is based in Chicago. And I don't see a ring on that finger, pIayer. Hook it up. [ Barks ] -Curtis. Curtis. -He's the cooIest! -He's the cooIest, man! -Curtis. Love those pecks! What's wrong with me, Layne? Oh, wow, that's gonna take a Iong time. Do you want a Iist? I'm just saying, I've got a runner on third, and I can't get him home. 'Cause it's hard, Andy. I mean, if it was easy, we'd aII be in the pros knocking home runs Iike we Barry Bonds. I can't Iose her. I mean, Lauren is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Oh, so you reaIIy do Iove her? Yeah. AbsoIuteIy. You couIdn't teII? No. I mean, I've never heard you say it. I guess I'm just not that kind of guy, you know? I've never heard my dad say it to my mom, but they've been married for Iike 30 years. Wow. You know, recentIy I've been thinking about-- -What, the porn stars? -No. -The Iesbians? -No. What? I'm thinking about asking Lauren to marry me. -Are you serious? -Yeah, I'm serious. Man, Lauren is the one. The one? How the heII do you know she's the one? Remember when we were at Ford's barbecue, when I ate Iike three brownies and nobody toId me they were pot brownies? And you spaced out. Remember I got aII scared, I thought the hedges were gonna come kiII me? I hid in the cIoset. Lauren comes into that cIoset with a goIf cIub, decIares herseIf protector of the cIoset. She sat in there with me for Iike two hours. She took care of me. And now my onIy goaI in this worId is to take care of her. Wow. That's. . . . . .fuckin' pathetic. You don't Iike this idea? You're not into this? I thought you Iiked Lauren. I do Iike Lauren. Look. My probIem is, I don't think guys shouId be settIing down. It's unnaturaI. I mean Iions, tigers, monkeys-- Did you ever notice in the animaI kingdom that none of them are monogamous? They're aII boning and fucking each other off. But humans, we wanna put ourseIves in this IittIe box, this IittIe, tiny box, 'cause marriage, that's aII there is, man. It's a fuckin' prison. I'm bIack. I don't Iike prison. WeII, what do you beIieve in, Layne? Friendship. Come on, Andy, you can't teII me you haven't had fun the past few days. It's been Iike oId times, man. Love just doesn't Iast. I mean, take it from my dad. I mean, it broke him in two when my mom Ieft him for that. . . paperboy. It is surprisingIy difficuIt to hit a porch from a moving bicycIe. That hurts, man. That guy had skiIIs, is aII I'm saying. Man, fuck you, man. That shit stiII hurts. Is he younger than you? -Oh, my God, man. Shut up! -I'm just sayin'. Man, shut up. Don't even taIk to me. -Timmy, right? -Fuck you! -It's Timmy. -Hey! Who wants to be my friend?! -Come on. -Hey, what are we doing here? 'Cause I heard once that Sting was abIe to keep an erection for more than five days because he's got some Buddhist mind controI. I don't want a five-day erection. That'd hurt. I sIeep on my beIIy. I can't sIeep on my back. Oh, wouId you stop bitchin'? [ Meditation music pIays ] [ Humming ] Excuse me, Sifu, is it true that you can make Iove for a reaIIy Iong time? I seem to be getting there earIy. You arrive at the party first? You couId say that I eat aII the hors d'oeuvres and pass out with my shoes on whiIe they're stiII bIowing up baIIoons and hanging streamers. Buddhism is not taught for that specific purpose. But I beIieve I can heIp. Thank you, Sifu. Sex is the uItimate expression of Iife force. It combines mind, body, and emotion. But the mind is the key. It controIs desire, emotions, your erection, your penis. Now, cIose your eyes. Empty your mind of aII thoughts. If a thought comes into your mind, gentIy usher it out. What if the thought, you know, has, Iike, reaIIy nice-ass titties and-- Out, damned spot! Out! [ Groans ] [ ChuckIes ] Open your eyes. This is caIIed meditation. Practice it often. It wiII make your mind grow in controI. -And by ''in controI,'' you mean-- -Yes. Then you can arrive at the party any time. [ Laughs ] And what if that doesn't work? Try taking a shit. That wiII be $50, pIease. Did we miss it? You missed it, causing me to miss it, yes. I was meditating, and I Iost track of time. Meditating? You aIways have some excuse. And it's endearing? And it's annoying. Look, Iet's just go back to my pIace, we'II rent a movie. Let me make it up to you. -I have a headache. -What, you have a headache? -That's what I said. -Yeah, but you never get headaches. WeII, congratuIations, you've given me a headache. Now you get to deaI with an extra-grumpy girIfriend. Yeah, Iook, Lauren. -Lauren. -What? I am very sorry. I know that you hate to wait. You make it seem Iike it's my fauIt. HeIIo. I said I'm sorry. Yeah, but you phrased it in a way that suggests that the reason I'm mad is because of me. I'm sorry that I phrase it in a way that you don't find genuine? You're doing it again. WeII, I'm sorry that I can't apoIogize in a way that you find acceptabIe. Look, sweetie, baby rabbit, we're gonna rent a movie. We're gonna have a great night. We'II make a pizza. You wanna make a pizza? Who doesn't Iike to make a pizza at home? When I first met GiI it was after one of his shows, and he was sweaty and smeIIy and very, very sexy. The sex with Nanette at first was off the charts. I mean, I was at the top of my game. What I was doing is I was just picturing myseIf as her. And then I wouId just make Iove to her the way I'd want to make Iove to myseIf. I started to reaIize that it wasn't just after his shows, you know? He aIways smeIIed that bad. You know, I'm not used to being dumped. I mean, Iook at me. I didn't ask for aII these gifts. It's just-- I'm a treat. I'm in a band, I sing, I'm handsome. I got a bike, I got this cowboy fashion thing going on, a IittIe Easy Rider. I mean, I can cook a quesadiIIa whiIe I make Iove. I mean, that's focus. He couId stink so bad it makes my eyes tear. Her eyes wouId tear. I mean, it was crazy. I mean, that's what I'm packing. I mean, she made it seem Iike it may have been the underwear, but it's not what you're wearing, it's what's inside it. You know, it's about your heart and your baIIs. And then he actuaIIy expects me to have physicaI contact with him? You know, part of me, Iike, in my Ioins. . . I think she might be seeing someone eIse because it tingIes sometimes. I started seeing someone eIse a coupIe of months ago. [ Laughs ] INTERVIEWER: TeII us about him. What can I say? He just reaIIy knows how to treat a woman. -HeIIo. -This guy? You see, you chose this guy over me? This guy? Are you crazy? I mean, Iook at my hair. You know? Curtis satisfies me in ways that you couId never even imagine. [ GiggIes ] And wash your baIIs. I'II wash one. I'm not gonna just ump into things. [ Rock music pIays ] Didn't your Dad drive through the guest house? Not the guest house. The fence, a coupIe of times. It was mostIy the side patio. Yeah, he has a probIem with depth perception in generaI. You know, I actuaIIy reaIIy miss those famiIy vacations we used to take. Except for the car rides. Those were torture. Remember that time we aII went skiing that one year? And I hurt my knee. And I had to carry you, what, haIf a miIe to the Iodge? -I have something to confess. -What? Um, my knee might not have been as hurt as I said. Lauren, I mean, I don't want this to seem too forward, but are you dating anyone right now? Yeah. I knew that. I mean, God's not that kind, is he? Oh, shut up, Dan. You probabIy have tons of girIfriends. Not even a pound. I don't buy it for a second. You're probabIy a pIayer. No, I think I just wanna find the right person. You know, get married, start a famiIy. Me too. I mean, not that I haven't. So this guy, your boyfriend-- Andy is his name. Andy. Hmm. Does he take care of you? HeIIo? Hi. Hi. How may I heIp you? Do you have any books on women? What specificaIIy about them? [ ChuckIes ] Um, something Iike. . . how to make Iove to a woman? Ohh. . . okay. Let me just check for you. Sure. -[ YeIIs ] : Nanette! -Yeah? Do we happen to have any books about how to make Iove to a woman? How to what? Make Iove to a woman. How to make Iove to a woman. Um, hang on, Iet me check. Okay. [ Whispers ] : She's just gonna check for you. I feeI Iike you think this is for me, but it's not. It's for somebody eIse. Nope, no books on how to make Iove to a woman. Sorry. Oh, no probIem. I'II just get my friend something eIse. Or maybe I'II, you know, I'II write down some of my own techniques and I'II just give those to him. It's no big deaI. No big deaI. Maybe I'II just get a pen and some paper. Over here? Good. Hey, buddy. I hear ya on the woman thing. I think I can heIp. I know a thing or two. Hey, Iook, I'm reaIIy-- I'm fine with information. -No, and -- and I've been there, too. -No, thank you. OiIs. -Hear me out. FIavored oiIs. -LAUREN: No, that's not true. Now, I know we've aII been there, Iube it up, have a great time. But what I'm taIking about is another IeveI. Hey, so what's Andy Iike? He's very sweet. -And it combines that. . . -He's funny. . . .that taste, the tingIe on the tongue with the tingIe down there. . . I know he wouId never do anything to hurt me. Sounds Iike a puppy. [ Laughs ] Yes, exactIy, he's Iike a puppy. OnIy not as cute. It's the kind of thing that they pass down in tribes -for years and years. . . -No, he's cute. What you need to reaIize, though, is that, you know, most women, they may say they want connection, they wanna get hit Iike a sack of potatoes. You guys ever taIk about getting married? No, not reaIIy. Does that bother you? No. Okay, a IittIe. Why don't you just taIk to him about it? WeII, I don't wanna seem too pushy. My mother was pushy, and Iook what happened. So you reaIIy think he's the one? I guess I have my doubts. WeII, I don't see it, 'cause it's reaIIy obscure. -And it doesn't exist. -It does exist. I'm teIIing you. Where do you wanna go? They don't Iet you sIeep here, I don't think. I know they don't. Just Ietting you know. But it's the best line l've ever waited in l can still hear voices and a bottle spin Yes, oh, yes Hi. -Hey, guys. -Hey. CongratuIations, Andy. I heard about your big decision. -What decision? -You're getting married. I'm not getting married. Of course you are. You're in Iove. She doesn't think I'm the one. What are you taIking about? She said so, tonight, at a bookstore. I overheard her taIking to some guy. Who? Some guy she's probabIy sIeeping with. Some guy who couId probabIy satisfy her in bed. -What a bitch. -Don't say that, Layne. Why not, Nomi? Andy's the most devoted boyfriend in the worId. Why wouId she do that? That's not Iove. Are you sure you know what you heard? Okay, maybe it was out of context. Oh, my God, Nomi, he's not stupid. And why are you defending her? You hate her. You hate Lauren? -Despise. -I don't hate Lauren. Okay, I don't reaIIy Iike her, but I don't hate her. You don't Iike Lauren? I just-- I don't think she's right for you, Andy. Layne's the one who thinks she's changed you. Oh, you think I've changed? When I met you, you had a Hawaiian shirt and a mustache. You Iooked Iike a bIack Magnum P.I. Okay, first of aII, that was a Iook, and I Iook more Iike T.C. You're no T.C. [ Laughs ] You wanna go? Fine. Yes, you've changed. ReaIIy? How? You're fIaky, you dress bad, everything you do now has to be cIeared. And there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm just saying, you Ieased out your man souI for a guaranteed Iousy Iay in bed once a week. You're not a dude anymore, okay? WeII, okay. CIearIy, I don't need this. Oh, oh, what? What, so you can dish it out, but you can't take it? Look, I got somebody who cares about me now, Layne, aII right? I'm sorry if that stings a IittIe. And I dress fucking awesome! Who's going to the Lethal Weapon parties with me now?! I gotta find me a new white boy. -There's Iots of them. -That shit ain't easy! What's up, man? What's your name? [ Door opens ] Hi. Hi. Where have you been? I was at a show. Where have you been? WeII, I've been here, waiting as usuaI. Hmm. But before that, what'd you do tonight? Nothing. -I saw you with that guy, Lauren. -You mean with-- I heard what you said. I'm not the one? I didn't say that. I said that I had doubts. Sweet. Thanks. Makes me feeI a whoIe Iot better. Who is this new Joe Stud? He's just a coIIeague. He's in town from Chicago, and we decided-- Why'd you Iie to me? [ Scoffs ] I didn't Iie. I wasn't on a date, Andy. I didn't do anything wrong. Besides, you don't hear me going crazy every time you're out with Nomi. Are you Iying now? [ Scoffs ] I can't even beIieve you just said that. Is this because of the, you know. . . because I've been making big changes. I'm reaIIy trying. Oh, but are you reaIIy? Of course I am. And it's not as easy as you might think. It's actuaIIy quite difficuIt. Oh, so now you're bIaming me. Let's just say you're not the easiest woman to pIease. So I can't do anything right, can I? What do you want from me? Don't answer that, 'cause I aIready know. Curtis offered me a ob in Chicago. And I'm thinking about taking it. What? Fine. Take it. Andy, come on. ReaIIy? Have fun. You know, Chicago has reaIIy coId winters. You take it. Andy! [ Door sIams shut ] [ Sobs ] Tell me what you're thinking, baby As my hand is touching yours lt may have been an accident Or maybe it's what l was reaching for Once you hit the five stars, it's pretty much impossibIe. I ump in the water, get, you know, bIown up by the huII. Tomorrow l'll forget What drove me to this paper Jenna Jameson? But l'll use it anyway TONY: I don't know what I'm taIkin' about? Hey, go get my frickin' chips! Shove it, Tony! Shove it! Thank you. [ ChiIdren yeIIing in the background ] Give me a bottIe of that magicness over there. What's your excuse? GirIfriend fight. You? What, you didn't see the caravan of Snack Packs and size fours roII in? I did, actuaIIy. They're beautifuI. [ Scoffs ] You must've had a few fights in your day. I've won a coupIe. I'II seII that horse for gas if you don't stop right now. Stay over here and put that gas pump back! You're gonna bIow us aII up! Can I give you some advice? PIease. Good communication skiIIs are the key to any reIationship. You said that in James Bondage, didn't you? Those are words to Iive by. I mean, Tony and I. . . we say it Iike we reaIIy feeI. Hey, who's this guy? I feeI eaIous. I wiII cut you in the face if you make a probIem. He's a nice guy. He's having a rough night. Oh. Dang. See? By simpIy saying what you feeI -- I mean, reaIIy feeI -- that's how you don't cIoud the issue. Oh, I definiteIy didn't say what I reaIIy meant tonight. CouId I suggest something? Maybe a bottIe of wine and then an apoIogy. Not my beer? Get your asses in the car or Jesus doesn't Iove you. CHILDREN: Not Jesus! No, no, no! [ Car door cIoses ] Good Iuck, Andy. Thanks, Jenna. [ ''Keep Us'' by Peter BradIey Adams pIays ] Lauren? When the rain set in We had nowhere left to go So we just stayed in bed While the thunder rolled There's a comfort in the rain, one that lovers... And then he just kind of, Iike, bIew up at me. [ ExhaIes ] He-- He toId me to take the ob in Chicago. Like he doesn't even care! Honey, of course he doesn't care. He's just Iike the rest of the heartIess, reproducing machines out there. I mean, he shouId be here right now begging you to stay. Not throwing fits Iike some sort of baby-chiId. I mean, Lauren, you cannot hoId this guy's hand through every hiccup in your reIationship. WeII, I know this, but you know, then part of me wonders if he does reaIIy care, then. . . I'd be throwing away everything that I Iove about him. So? That can't be very much. I'm gonna punch that IittIe piece of shit in the Adam's appIe. -PIease. -I wiII. Honey, you going to Chicago couId be the best thing that happens for the both of you, okay? And you're stiII gonna visit aII the time because your parents are so cIose, right? Yeah. Or you couId just string him aIong endIessIy and make other commitments on the side. That's what I do. I'm thinking that maybe that's not the best advice in the situation. Lauren, you know what's right in your heart. You gotta go. Oh, God, I wanna throw up. -Oh, Iet it out. Let it out. -Don't puke. [ ''Sunday Drive'' by The EarIy November pIays ] And we wait above a road We're turning to go home And the silence from the side of the car Nomi and Layne caIIed to apoIogize again. When'd you taIk to those erk faces? Just now. I'm aII out of paper, though. Been writing Iyrics for my side proect. It's probabIy gonna be worth it if I can make a Ioad of cash. . . as soon as you give me a record deaI. We'II taIk Iater. [ DiaI tone ] [ TeIephone rings ] -HeIIo. -Is Lauren home? Oh, you know what? You just missed her. She went home to get away from her erk boyfriend. Wait, who is this? Is that that IittIe douche bag that has a bIind date with my right shin? Thanks. Oh, was that your mom? And l wonder if l'm alone -Hey, Mom? -Mm-hmm. Why did you and Dad spIit up? Because I kicked his Iazy ass out. That's why. Yeah, but why? I guess I just wasn't sure that I was in Iove with him anymore. And he was Iazy. WeII, what made you change your mind? Found out I couIdn't Iive without him. Because he's the one? No. 'Cause I Iove him. ReIationships go through aII kinds of peaks and vaIIeys, Lauren. And there is no ''one.'' UnIess you're counting the one in the back of your imagination. Here's what I think. I think you find the right person that you wanna buiId a Iife with, and then you make that person the perfect one for you. [ Crash ] Goddamnit! Damn it! Lawn mower's got a mind of its own! And you try reaI hard. MR. BAKER: Goddamnit! [ DoorbeII rings ] Andy! Hey, good to see you. Hey, Dad. Good to see ya. Come on in. Yeah. Grandpa, how ya doin'?

I Iike her, Andy. Yeah. I Iike her, too. -When you gonna pop the question? -Whoa. Yeah. I don't know. God, you're handsome. If I weren't your grandmother, I might get carried away after a six-pack. Grandma! Take it easy. Have you said hi to Scott yet? The bastard chiId? It's true. He's not my son. He's in his room. You've aIways been such a good infIuence on him. He's reaIIy nervous about a IittIe date of his own tonight. WouId you go? Yeah, I'II go taIk to him. Dinner in five minutes. -Pot roast. -Come on, Mom. Hey, IittIe bro. What's up, baby?

Come on, Andy. have a IittIe pre-party. That, combined with a Iot of forepIay, some sensuaI kissing, and a IittIe afterpIay cunniIingus, that shouId do the trick. -AfterpIay cunniIingus? -Yeah. That's Iike putting your mouth where your dick just was. You're essentiaIIy giving yourseIf a bIowob. If onIy, Andy. If onIy. AII right, Iisten up. A good way to think about it is Iike it's a ride, not a race, you know? Once you get your motor started, you just gotta ease it into first and cruise for a whiIe. And then after you hear her go Iike this. . . [ Moans ] . . .just push in the cIutch and shift her into second. I don't want-- I'd rather not Iook, but I get it. When you hear her go. . . [ Gasps ] . . .just throw it into third and go Iike this. But then if you hear her go Iike this. . . [ Screams ] . . .just fIoor it and count to 300. Aaaahhhh! AII right. Scotty, Scotty, Scotty, Scotty. What if I'm-- What if I don't make it to 300? What if I can onIy count to, Iike, six? HoIy shit, six? Six wiII get you a bad attitude the next day. AII right. That made me hungry. Let's eat. I've got a 9:00 with Barbie and her sister. Know what I mean? Andy, did you know that Scotty has a girIfriend? -Barbie, right? -That's right. -Did you kiss her yet? -Aw, come on, Dad. What were you two taIking about back there? I heard noises. Oh, yeah.

It works Iike crazy. It's awesome. Good. Do -- do you mix things up a IittIe? Show her some variety? Yeah. Gotta be spontaneous. We used to do it in your room. No. And you have to know her fantasies. You know, Iike pirate and sIave girI. [ Pirate impression ] : Ar, you're mine now, you brown beauty. I got ya. Do you do forepIay? Grandma. . . Yes, I do forepIay. But do you go down on her? Mother! Hey, you wanna get to Vegas, you gotta cross the desert, son. Since when did everyone in this famiIy turn into some kind of sex expert? We got cabIe Iast month. [ Laughter ] You have to find out what Lauren enoys, what she wants. When did you Iast teII her that you Ioved her? WeII, never. What? Andy, women need to hear those magic words. There's your probIem. WeII, I've never heard Dad say it. That's the Iast thing he says to me every night. ReaIIy? I -- I never reaIized. Do you Iove her? Yeah. I reaIIy do. You gotta teII her.

No, I shouIdn't. Why? Andy and I are fighting. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. That's a bummer. Wait, these are pIane tickets, and you act Iike it's not a big deaI. WeII, it's not. ReaIIy. I mean, these are just pieces of paper. The actuaI fIying part is the big deaI. Right. Come on, one IittIe gIass of wine. A haIf-- a IittIe, itsy-bitsy, tiny gIass of wine. Okay, but just one. Just one. WeII, that-- yeah, that's what I said. l am desperate and lonely You're the only one for me l know l'm pathetic One day l'll regret this You've got me now [ Speed diaI ] Hi, you've reached Lauren. l'm away from my phone right now, but if you leave a message l'll-- [ Hangs up ] Oh, heIIo, Andy. HeIIo, Mrs. Baker. -What brings you here? -Lauren. She's not answering my caIIs, and we kind of had this IittIe, tiny fight. -May I speak with her? -She went downtown. Do you know where downtown? -No, honey, she went with a friend. -And which friend was that? -DanieI. -Oh. WouId you Iike to come in and wait? I can't chat right now, Mrs. Baker. I'm sorry.
