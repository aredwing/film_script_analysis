Misko... taking your favourite suckers for a ride, again? No... I've had some luck the past day or two. I hadn't won a game in months. You mean, you hadn't LOS a game in months? Please, don't make us cry over your wretched fate... Now, for instance, I've got a streak. This two of clubs alone is enough for a hand. I don't mind him winning. But I can't listen to these stories anymore. Sonja, don't you get it? A two of clubs has already gone by. THETOUR The chance for another is 1 :108. Zaki, you deal. How about a little side job? -Foreign currency payment. -Really? -Where? -About Serbian Krajina. -No way.There's a war over there. -No, no. It's as peaceful as a spa in Srbobran. Except, instead of mineral water, they drink each other's blood. No, it's quiet there now. Just for a day or two, and we'll be right back. They're sending a van, everything's set. There's no way I'm going. We could perform that Feydeau piece, "A Flea in Her Ear". Great idea! -That was such a dreadful play. -It doesn't matter. People there need to laugh. -I'm not going either. -We couldn't go. -Who could playthe young girl? -I know who couldn't. Zaki, has the alcohol sucked up all your brains? Do you remember anything at all? I played Eugenie twenty five years ago. Do you remember who my partner was? -No clue. -You. Zivorad, you were my partner. -That idiotic play screwed up my life. -Oh, come on now. You were such a stud back then. -And look at you now. -What's wrong with me? I have a solution for Eugenie. My girlfriend is a student of acting. -Your girlfriend? -Well, yes. -Stanislav, you have a girlfriend? -Why wouldn't he? Never mind... You've gone too far. It's no longer a theatre, it's a gambling den. Calm down, Predrag. We'll stop right away. In your dreams! You owe me ten, and you want to quit? And you, Zaki. You chose to ignore ten stage calls. -I didn't hear the call, I swear. -You didn't hear? You should be ashamed ofyourselves! You've turned into a bunch of lazy shitheads. You make me sick. Your move, Zaki. Excuse me, Predrag, who were you referring to when you said that? This was the finest theatre for decades. You managed to turn it into a low-life gambling house. I think I have the right to do what I want in my own free time. If rehearsal is free time for you, then the same goes for me. How dare he talkto me like that! -Asshole! -Some director he is. His plays never had more than five performances. Over there, they see us as their saviours. It means a world to them to have someone from Belgrade. And, it's perfectly safe. I don't know, I have a bad feeling about it. Do you have a feeling about your debts? -What are you trying to say? -You owe me 200 for two months now. Plus these ten... I work for peanuts in this awful town, and this talentless creep lectures me! -I workfor even less. -Rehearsal has been cancelled. They will welcome us there like brothers. They're providing everything. The food, the hotel. How about drinks? Of course. And it's all free. We could go, if it really means so much to them. If Zaki is going, then I have to go. There's no way he'd come back alive. I'll never get rid of you, Zivorad... -Why did we split up anyway? -Twice, my love. How much could we earn there? Seven or eight hundred Deutsche Marks each. At least 500. It depends on the number of performances. Sounds good. -But the set, the costumes... -That depends. That would be embarrassing. I've got a reputation to keep. -And I don't? -I didn't say that. -We'll loot the costume department. -Sounds great. -Shall we continue? -Whose turn is it to deal? Sonja... Written and Directed by: Sunday, December 12, 1993 Allow me to introduce you. This is our driver. -Djuro. -And this is... -Our young colleague... -Jadranka. I'm honoured... I'm Jadranka. -Hi, I'm Lale! -I know. Jadranka... -Are you okay? This is yours? -Yes. -I'll get it... it's okay. -Thank you. -Stanislav, what's this... THIS?! -A van. This is an amphibian? No, it's a UFO. An unidentified flying object. Serbian mother raises her son To fight against theTurks... Mister Djuro... please... Could you change this station that sounds like they torture animals? Thank you. Jadranka... -What year are you in? -Third. Really? What do you in the third year? Tragedies. I'm preparing Euripides' Iphigenia in Aulis for my exam. Really? And which part will you be playing? -Iphigenia. -Iphigenia herself? No more wasting time! Let's go over the lines. Lale as Camille, Jadranka as Eugenie, and the rest in their old roles. Misko as Chandebise, Sonja as Raymonde. Zaki as the doctor and the colonel. From the beginning. -I'll jump in for what we can't cut. -You? Just for the parts we can't cut out. This is not a festival, it's a side job. Let's start. -And... who will play Etienne? -I will. -You? -That's not an important role. I enter with Zaki and I say: "Please come in, doctor". Then, Lale and Jadranka, caught in the act... -They break up the hug. -Wait a minute... Didn't you say she was Eugenie? The roles of Antoinette and Eugenie will merge together. I'm not taking another actress along just for that minor part. Lale, Jadranka, go on... -Simulate! -Okay. -What are you doing here? -I? Because of the order, for supper. -This hurts... -What order? Don't you know that the Master and Mistress are out? Get out of here! Shoo! Zaki... Aren't you a strict husband. That's the way with women. If you don't keep a grip on them, they'll keep the pressure on you. -That's not myway. -Bravo, bravo. See, doctor, this little wife is as loyal as a dog... But as jealous as a tiger... Hello. Where are you headed? -Here's the travel order. -I asked them, not you. -Any Muslims here? -No, all Serbs. Miodrag Kraljeviae? We are theatre performers from Belgrade, we are going to that... -Srbobran. -Sir, we have been invited. We have to perform in the Republic of Srpska. -Jawaharlal? -I beg your pardon? Who? Jawaharlal, answer me. This must be a mistake. There is nobody here with that name. -You mean, Jawaharlal Nehru? -Yes.That one. That's the address I live at. Jawaharlal Nehru street, in Belgrade. Have a safe trip. Jadranka, has anyone contacted you for a job yet? AEirilov came to watch our exam last year. But I still haven't received any offers for a project. That first step is extremely important. People have to see you, to discover you. After that, everything seems to flow. Yes, but what can us, young people do when nobody... -How could I... -It's simple! There is no shame in it. I thinkthat... -Misko, please, cut it out! -What is it? -What's going on? -Nothing, nothing... You are talented, beautiful, and you are educated for the job. You could come to our theatre and say: "I want to act. Give me a part." -As if that's possible... -Why not? I can arrange a... My little... I would like to... with you... -Come on, Misko... -What's your problem? -What's this, Djuro?! -Nothing to worry about! That's normal when you're passing through the corridor! -Through the WHAT? -The fucking corridor! Hey, that's normal when you're passing... Sir... sir... -Desk clerk! -Yeah. We are theatre performers from Belgrade. We have a reservation. -Four single rooms, one double. -All the rooms are taken. Try the restaurant. Mothers with children are there. Wait... I have an agreement with some... With a... Gavro. -Colonel Gavro? -Yes, him. -Where can I find him? -Try the Army Club. Excuse me... Wait for me here, I'm going to find the Assistant for Morale. -Who? -Colonel Gavro. -He's the guy in charge here! -We're supposed to just wait? There's no heating in here. Askthem to put us in a different hotel. -I'll be right back. -Hurry up. Jadranka, you want my jacket? -My legs are cold. -You don't say. When are we scheduled to return home? Well... sometime in spring. If I ever catch them together again, that's the end of them! Sir... comrade... when we agreed about the tour... I was told that we would be accommodated in a hotel. Fooling around with a radical, the whore! There is no room in the hotel. Not an inch of space. The actors are tired, theytravelled all that way... -Doroeviae, have you seen my wife? -No, Colonel, sir. -And that Radical, Aleksiae? -No, sir! Where the hell are they hiding? What do you want? Accommodation, for the actors. They travelled all day from Belgrade. So, where's the fucking problem? What is the concept of our program here? In the morning you act for civilians, in the afternoon, for the army. Why in the morning? How do you thinkyou're going to get there the same day? -Get where? -To the front lines. Dear actors... Welcome to Srbobran. The last bastion of Serbhood before Turkish invasion and Croat Ustashas. You are sitting amongst real Serbs. But also, amongst those who suddenly became Serbs. They had taken off their Communist costumes and put on new uniforms. -Those of the Serbian army. -What is this guy saying? We, The White Eagles, did not wait for the fall of communism. We already knew which nation we belong to. I'll show you, you piece of shit! Gentlemen... gentlemen! As our poet Djura would say: Are you my kin, you poor soles Are you, too, drowning in woes So you came here at once So we could get to know One another better Singing a sorrowful duet: We are small but we know That no one will want us like you Tweet, tweet... Over the Konjuh mountain The wind is humming The leaves are singing Sorrowful songs Their comrade is dead The coal miner is dead They eat him for breakfast The Partisans have a feast Follow me, brothers! Charge! Marija Karanoviae. I am the teacher here. -Misko. Nice to meet you. -I know. Who wouldn't know you? I saw you in "Corolian". -He's quite the lady-killer, isn't he? -I don't know. No, no... he isn't. Oh yes, he is. He can fool around in Belgrade, but not here. -This guy will kill you. -Yes, he will! He almost killed me at least a hundred times! But I don't care! Go on! Go on, kill me! At least you'll free me from this life in misery! Misko, please take me away from here. I want to go to Belgrade with you. I want to go to the theatre every evening. Alert! -Stanislav, where are you?! -Here I am. Monday, December 1 3, 1993 -Adventure with whom? -I can't tell you that. Now I address the audience: He can't tell me?!The old coquette. -That woman will fill the gap. -No, I saythat. We have a full house! The town's interest in our performance is unheard-of. Tickets were sold out in twenty minutes. Is there any other place in town with heating? Mijo, come and see how warm it is in here! A bitter biting bittern Bit a better brother bittern... Are you nervous? This is, practically, your first performance. No, I have a fever. I caught a cold last night. -Should I make the mole bigger? -It looks great on you. My dear young colleague, why do you need so much makeup? You're young, beautiful, whywould you need it? Try acting from the inside. I was told we need a lot of makeup, for stylization. Stylization is usually a sign of weakness. It's not a matter of style, but taste. Now I really don't know what to do! Some say this, other... Why are you raising your voice!? Leave me alone! Listen, you amateur. You weren't even born when I was the leading lady in theatre. -From leading, to cleaning lady. -What did you say?! Wait, you don't understand... What's going on? Come on, people, we're starting! Great, thanks. What are you doing here? Me? Because of the order for supper! What order? Don't you know that the Master and Mistress are out? Get out of here! Shoo! Aren't you a strict husband. That's the way with women. If you don't keep a grip on them, they'll keep the pressure on you. -That's not myway. -Bravo, bravo. See, doctor, this little wife is as loyal as a dog. But as jealous as a tiger. All this trouble makes no sense when I lose the money before I earn it. -How many cards? -Two. -I don't have a set. I'm bluffing. -I know.Three for me. Ifwe have a full house tomorrow, we'll have more money than we thought. -I can lose any amount you imagine. -You owe me... -You won't forget? " -I will not, Madam. Is everything all right with you, Eugenie? With me? Thank you for asking. -And with you, Madam? -Everything is all right with me. -I no longer need you! -That surprises me. -Leave, I say! -Yes, Madam. And... where is Poche? Where is Poche? I should be asking that... where is Poche? Mijo! -I'm here! -Let's go home, man. -Wait. It's freezing outside. -Oh, screw this! They stare at us with blank expressions. Disaster. -Is it all right? -It's all right. Gentlemen... I suggest... You donate the entire fee from the gig to Serbian Sisters Charity. This is just a suggestion, but this will make you look good in public. -But... we agreed... -Wait! Please! -All right, I'll do it. -Congratulations. I knew you were true patriots. Somebody could address the audience for the occasion. Just a few words. -Who? -Anyone. You can do it. It's easyfor you to give out the money you already gambled away! What about the rest of us? -What do you mean, your husband? -Mister Chandebise! He is the spitting image of my servant Poche! So, the man I just saw in my bed and thought was myself, was in fact... That was Poche! -The one who sent me to the pub! -And had a pack saddle for wood! That was Poche! Always Poche! I would really like to see him up close. Bravo... bravo! Dear audience, please! On behalf of the actors, who came from Belgrade, to perform this jolly play for you... The representative of the Circle of Serbian Sisters, please come. Our troupe has decided to renounce... To renounce the earnings to the benefit of your organization. Stanislav... what is this?! Can you explain to us what's going on here? I have nothing to do with it. Ask Lale! -I taught you to take the money... -How dare you? He started twisting his arm! That colonel! That moron! Idiot! He's, completely... The van's waiting for you outside. You perform for the army. -What about our money? -This is a misunderstanding. As far as I can see, you have donated that money to charity. -I didn't at all.You started to... -What did I do? Please... don't perform this kind of rubbish for the fighters. I suggest you perform a historical Serbian piece. -Is that clear? -Yes, sir. We'll take twice the moneythere. The army is filthy rich. -Where do they get the money? -Looting, of course. -Want to continue? -I'm through with you. -Zaki? -I don't feel like it. "A Serbian historical piece." Why on earth did I get myself into this? She'll infect us all. What if we perform "Kadinjaea"? You know "Ten on one..," Can even that be possible, comrade? That's from communist times. Here, when they hear "communism"... -They go crazy. -That's the end of my patriotic list. What about Sterija? You know... "The Death of Stefan Deeanski"? I know that one. I played Zorka at the colloquium. What about us, who didn't do the colloquium? -I know Milorad's lines as well. -You don't say. Bravo! -Lale can play him, for instance. -I will. Great. I'm hit! -Am I wounded? -No, you're not. -You've been hit by a clod of mud. -I'm hit?! -Djuro, how much longer? -We're here! -Have a seat. -Hello. We are actors. We have come from Belgrade! -You brought the cigarettes? -No! -Where's your commanding officer?! -Who? Major Zmijanac? Over here! Faster! Get down on the ground! To the school! Go! Go! Wait here, until the situation calms down. -Where will we perform? -Here, come on. Over here. Come here. Come. This is where you will perform. But... how? There are wounded people here. They won't bother you. I have to go. Men! Follow me! Zorka, don't be afraid! I will set you free! It's not bad... Hello. Sir... -Sir... -Yes? We're from Belgrade. Really? Me too. What can I do for you? Do you know of a place for... Where we could concentrate? -These are our famous actors... -I'm Sonja. You're from Belgrade, too? Wonderful. What are you doing here? I've been Called to help out. What can I tell you? Go to the operating theatre. There's nobodythere. Doctor! Over here! Excuse me. What is it? -Fucking "eighty-two"... -Bring him to me right away! Don't worry, we'll save you. Pray to God. God has no time. I'm way at the end of the line. There are those waiting in front of me. Do I have a fever? I'm burning up. She'll infect us all. Do you want my jacket? Lale, there's a doctor here who can help. You've brought us to a real fine place, Stanislav. Nobody mentioned any of this when we negotiated the details of the tour. Oh, really! Thank you, doctor. You're wonderful. -You shouldn't have. -Thankyou. I'd rather not, thankyou. Right about now... Starting from dusk, until dawn... A ceasefire begins. The devil only knows whythat is. Both sides just fire random shots, anyway. This entire war is irrational in manyways. First, the warring parties consist of the same people. They share the same language, mentality and feelings. They don't differ in any way. It would be difficult to shoot a movie about this war. Not only because of the costumes, but generally. In a real war movie you can tell the difference between the two sides. They look different, they act differently. While here... The Serbs, the Croats, the Muslims... they are all the same. Identical people. The same people. Doctor... There's no need... You already washed your hands. When we take things as they really are, my illustrious master Stefan, ...that is exactly what a ruler should do. For example, had your high kingdom not taken the illustrious Marija, ...then Serbia would not have the Severina region. If one of your sons would get one region from the Greeks, ...and another son a region from the Bosniaks. -Imagine howvast Serbia would be! -Right on! Serbia! Your words are wise and patriotic,Teofil. We shall find Dusan another girl. As pretty as this one. And of gentler birth and a fine upbringing. Dusan may get married against your will. And then, your shame shall be endless. Dusan is an obedient child. But he might not be in the heat of passion. No answer from father yet Oh... I have never in my life been so impatient. Zorka is a girl capable of mystifying the most rational ones among us. Zorka is a girl capable of mystifying the most rational ones among us. She can stir up the thickest of blood. Bring Zorka!! -We want Zorka! -We want Zorka! Stop it! Go on. Zorka is the only creature... that makes me indifferent to my kingdom. And yet... I cannot have her, unless I am king. And yet... I cannot have her, unless I am king. -Bring Zorka! -We want Zorka! Site of my bitter bliss. Oh, site full of pain and sorrow! Allow me to cry at my mother's grave and lift the burden off my heart. Way to go, Zorka, my love! He does not understand the affections of a young girl! The tongue is frightened to speak on the heart's behalf! To openly say how it pines for Milorad! You will not capture her, you damn dragon! You will not capture her, you damn dragon! Milorad is prepared to die for her! -Surrender! Surrender! -Milorad! -Have no fear! I shall rescue you! -From whom? -From the dragon who will eat you! -Milorad, eat my cock! You've turned into a fly! -Truth is bright, evil is shady! -And it fucks your lady! Zorka... the earth is big! But love is greater than the earth, and the sun! But love is greater than the earth, and the sun! Life is in the heart! -Call the doctor! -What happened? -Call the doctor! -What happened? It's nothing,just a little scratch. You think we've come to this hell to get attacked byyour soldiers?! And you think my army is supposed to watch all the shit you... What did you say? What did you say? They get killed on a daily basis. They're not shitheads for whom you can perform any old rubbish! And what are you? A theatre critic? How dare you!? Sonja, please. Major, sir, in spite of all the misunderstandings... We are prepared to forget about it... and part with you on a friendly basis. We are prepared to forget about it... and part with you on a friendly basis. You will pay what you owe us, and we will leave. Pay? Do you know that in that case you become war profiteers? -You could face a firing squad. -I'm sorry? -You could face a firing squad. -I'm sorry? -When do we start? -Be quiet, Lale. Where is the doctor? We had a mishap, one of our colleagues fainted. No more doctor in here. He fluttered away. Excuse me? -He got killed, for fuck's sake. -No, I don't think you understood me. The tall, handsome doctor, from Belgrade. That's the one. The mine got him when he went for a piss. How?When? About half an hour ago, maybe 45 minutes. Half an hour. About half an hour ago, maybe 45 minutes. Half an hour. "Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious" by Sigmund Freud Where is that... Djuro? Where is that... Djuro? Hello!Van! No Djuro... no van... He won't be here before tomorrow. What? What do you mean? We were supposed to spend the night here, so he returned to Srbobran. -What are we supposed to do now? -Go back and wait for him. What else? -I'm not going backthere. -Me neither. -I'm not going backthere. -Me neither. What are we supposed to do? It's night time. I don't care.You're the tour manager. You figure it out! Sonja, are you crazy? Don't you realize the situation we are in? Am I crazy? Are you crazy?! -I want to go home. -We can't go without Djuro! I want to go home. I'm off. -Sonja! -I'm leaving! We can't just let her go on her own. We can't just let her go on her own. Wait, maybe we can get a taxi on the way! Maybe we'll find some transportation! People! What's wrong with you?! -Sonja, Misko, wait for me! -There's a war going on... -Sonja, Misko, wait for me! -There's a war going on... Tuesday, December 14, 1993 Tuesday, December 14, 1993 The fresh air is killing me. Zaki, watch your step. -Which way now? -This way. -Misko, don't... -I can do it. It's just... slippery! Let's go. Let's go. Now, Zaki... Halt. Halt. -Landmines. -Where? Buried in the ground. That's why they call them "landmines". Stop! Don't move. There are mines everywhere. This one's marked. -The guys that put it there marked it. -That's right. We'll go along the river. -Come on, what are you waiting for? -We're waiting for you. -Come on, what are you waiting for? -We're waiting for you. Why me? Why don't you go first? You go right ahead. It was your idea. Easy, now... watch your step! Come on... Do you hear this? People... -I have a feeling these are... -Croats. What will happen now? Maybe they're Muslims. Now, THAT would be a relief. No, they're definitely Croats. If they recognize Sonja, we have a chance. If they recognize Sonja, we have a chance. You think theywouldn't recognize me? Me, too. I was on that series that was broadcast in Croatia. Don't you get it? It doesn't matter if they recognize you guys, but her. -Why? -Because she's Croatian. You're so stupid! What does that matter? You're so stupid! What does that matter? Hi! Hi, fellas! How're you doing? It's so cold. Aren't you freezing? Pardon... and you are...? We're actors. From... From the playhouse. -We came to visit you. -The playhouse? I don't know about that. What playhouse? That's... that's strange, indeed. That's... that's strange, indeed. They told us it was all organized and that you'd be waiting for us. You will act for us here? Yes! Here... There lies the true beauty of the playhouse. Art is everywhere. We are actors, you are the audience, and... What will you act out for us? Who might that chap over there be? My dear, his eyes are fastened on me, like he is drawn to me. I would say the chap is one of us. I would say the chap is one of us. The same blood as ours. -No... -My little Petrunjela... My little Petrunjela! By god, it is Pomet! By god, it is Pomet! Petrunjela, you pretty countrywoman... Pomet, what are you doing here? My mistress doesn't want you. How did you manage to get here? How did you get passed the Chetniks? How did you manage to get here? How did you get passed the Chetniks? If all of her attention is on this Maro, all of mine is on Petrunjela! I haven't been sold yet! By god, I am fond of you. You pest, give me a rest, take a hike, jump a dike. You pest, give me a rest, take a hike, jump a dike. Go to your ladies, to your Roman signoras! I am a Dubrovnik lass! You give yourself to me, for you will be mine! "Uncle Maroje", by Marin Drziae. "Uncle Maroje", by Marin Drziae. I know. I was an extra in the Gavela playhouse. That practically makes you our colleague! No, I did it for the cash, while I was a student. But once you experience the thrill of stage lights... That's what old stef always used to say. You know stef? That's what old stef always used to say. You know stef? The stage manager? Of course I know stef! When I think of all the times stef and I used to... -You were at the procession? -So many people at the burial. -You mean, the cremation? -Yes, the cremation. -You mean, the cremation? -Yes, the cremation. No slippers to use, barefoot she threads, on prickly thorn spreads! I'm not yours, just mine, so you go off and I'll be fine!

Of course I know Luce! She was a true legend of that theatre. Playhouse. Excuse me? In Croatian, it's "playhouse". Well, of course. What did I say? Well, of course. What did I say? Who are you people, anyway? Commandos? Sorry? stef is my brother-in-law. Lucija is my mother from Zabok. Neither of them has ever seen Zagreb or Gavela. Neither of them has ever seen Zagreb or Gavela. Now what? We are actors. Swear to God. -They'll kill us. -I hope not. -They'll kill us. -I hope not. No, they're taking us for a game of Slapjack. Maybe they want to exchange us for some Croat POWs. Have you seen a single living Croat POW? -Please, I'm from the Academy... -Go! -Please, I'm from the Academy... -Go! -Your side is over there. You can go. -What? You're free to go. But we can't go there. We've been there already. -Move it! -There's a minefield out there. -Do you hear?! -If we could go some other way... -Do you hear?! -If we could go some other way... Go on! Move it! Stop staring at me! Stop it! We're clearing the mine field, those shitheads... That's their only wayto break out from the encirclement. Who is breaking out, from who's encirclement?! Croats, from Serbian... it seems our boys have them surrounded. What our boys?! I haven't surrounded anybody! If you live, you can lodge a complaint in the newspapers. I will have nothing to do with your shitty war! Who are you talking to? I don'twanna die! I'm no Serb, I am an actor! Stop shouting, you mule! As if we're not actors! You kill actors! You are blowing up people who wouldn't hurt a fly! You blood-thirsty pieces of shit! Motherfuckers! Fuck!The Chetniks! Our guys! What our guys? Serbs... Throw down your weapons! Quick! Come on, hands up... Hands up! On your knees! Put your hands behind your head! Move it! Move it! So, what brings you here? Son, give us a strong drink so we can relax a little. Yesterday I shot a guy because of that. No drinking here. My Zaki! My Zaki! The man I loved to watch in the role of Bugs Bunny when I was a child! You made HIM clear the minefield? Misko! My Misko! The man who killed countless Germans in theTV series, you motherfuckers! Sonja... You push among the mines the sex symbol of a generation? Ifyou kill all our bitches, whose photo are we supposed to jerk off to?! Don't look up! -Sorry, Sonja. -It's okay. You, with the hat, come here. He says he's not a Serb. But he's not an actor either. Get over there! -Slavisa, to the minefield. -Yes, sir! So, what brought you here? -Sir... -Yes, Misko? Don't do it. -Don't do what? -That... Please. Where do you think you are? This is a war, not a movie set. Please... Please, don't do that to them. Stop! Hear me out. At the request of the celebrated actors from Belgrade... Your lives have been spared! I need a volunteer. You, come here. On the behalf of your group... You'll sing something for me. Is that alright? All right? Here we go... Hold me... -Take the road... -I don't know the lyrics. You see? How can I spare their lives if he doesn't know the lyrics? Those who don't know the lyrics... they walk! Hold me... Take the road... Cowards take... Mywandering eyes Will follow you... Female heart... Go! Go! Go! Gentle as a swallow... That dies from the pain... Hold me... Be a man just this once... Don't lie to me... If you go... Don't ever lookfor me... Go on... Don't look back, don't look at me. Go! Go! -I could always... -...see it coming. Coward... I didn't know you were such a... Coward... You sleep with me And lose sleep over another... You're afraid to admit it... Coward... You're just another coward... You think I'm that same little girl... Anyone can lie to... Thank you for the ride! Djuro, my man! -What's up? -Nothing much. When can we leave? -Where you goin'? -Back to Belgrade. So, whenever you're ready, we can... Me? You got to have a travel order. What order? It was agreed, you bring us here, and take us back. Yes, but I can't move without a travel order! Who could give me that? The commanding officer. -That Colonel Gavro? -Him, or someone else. The army. I said, if they don't send ammunition for the 53s and the tank 82s, they can expectTurks in Belgrade! We've been risking our asses here for two years! And they're jerking off in the capital! I have a speCial messagefor him. When he sent us into this war, he promised us the world! Now he gives us zilch! -What do you want? -I am... We agreed with Colonel Gavro. There's no more Colonel Gavro here. He was dismissed! Nevertheless, our group of theatre performers from Belgrade... Wait... What did you say? Theatre performers, actors... from Belgrade. So what, if they're from Belgrade? We're supposed to shit in our pants because you're from Belgrade? We had a firm agreement with Colonel Gavro. -It was about transport back to... -Listen to me, Belgrade. Gavro may have used our fuel on all sorts of crap, but I will not. People here have nothing to eat and he brings us scum of the earth. Don't be like that, those are all legends of the acting scene. -No way... you hear me? No! -But, they promised. Out. Scram! Nothing. -I'm going to talk to the guy. -Sonja, please! -Anyone but you. -Why? What's wrong with me? Nothing, just that maybe you're a little too... Too what? Can you be a little more specific? A little too sophisticated. What about me? -Maybe he will listen to me? -You? He can go if he wants to, but there's no chance. Now what? We're going to stay here for the rest of our lives? What do you people want from me?! I am just an actor, like you! How can I put some sense into the heads of all these maniacs? Am I supposed to put a stop to this idiotic war? How am I supposed to do that? How? Hey... that's Ljubiae! -Ljubiae! -Who's that? That writer who wrote... "The Serbian Golgotha" or some similar piece of shit. -A "great artist"! -Artist, my ass! -I'll have nothing to do with him. -And I will? I don't know, it's up to you. -Hello. -Hello. How long will this last? The bombing... -It will be over any minute now. -Great. Nice library. They obtained some good books. Would you like to see them? No, thankyou. "They", you say? -You're not from around here? -I'm from Knjazevac, Serbia. And what are you doing in Srbobran? Is your husband from Srbobran or... It's just that my son came here from Germany to fight. He had a good job there, in Michelstadt. When this all started, he enlisted as a volunteer, left his job. I mean, if he's here, what would I do in Knjazevac? And so I got this job. It's better to do something. -Back home, were you also a librarian? -No. I worked as a philosophy teacher in high school. Where is your son? He got killed this spring, near Derventa. Would you like to take a book out? Their positions... My dear fellow artist! What a surprise. Ready for your performance? Bravo! Mr. Ljubiae can arrange our transport with the local authorities. He is staying here for purposes of collecting material for his new novel. The title will be "Serbian Tragedy". Long time no see, Zaki. You look altered. How are you? I've seen better days. Can you really help with our transportation? But of course! The General is a good friend of mine. I'm so glad you're on our side, Sonja. You are looking better than ever! This is our young colleague, Jadranka Damjanoviae. You can tell straight away she's got talent. -I'm Lale. -I'm going with you to Belgrade. For a meal at the Literary Club and back.What do you say? -Great, I'll have the lamb tripe. -I won't have anything. I'll have the grilled chicken breast. -And at the end? At the end? -Custard pie! We'll leave tomorrow. What do you mean? Where will we sleep tonight? No problem. Danilo will take care of that. He's the big "boss" in this town. You're history! You're a dead man! Did you hear me?! -Get down! -You're raising your fist at me?! You don't know what you're doing, you idiot! Nobody ties my soldiers to poles and shaves their heads. You hear? 'Cause you're all pussies! You sit and drink while we defend your homes! These boys bleed for three years. You're here three days, Belgrade boy! And you already lecture them about courage? You've got an hour to get to Drina! Is that clear?! You knowwhat you can do? You can grab my cock! That's all you can do! Understand!? Who gave you the right to kill POWs? I exchange them for my fighters! I exchange them too, you pussy! Corpse for corpse! I'll get you now... Go ahead, shoot, you shit! Shoot, or throw it away! -Is everything alright? -Exceptional, Danilo, exceptional. These people are famous actors. Danilo is the king here! What will you eat? -No, thanks, we're stuffed. -Out of the question! I've got tripes, liver, pig balls, the best grilled meat in the area! We really can't. And we're tired, too. How about something sweet? Baklava? Tulumba? You fight against the Muslims and eatTurkish sweets? -What did you say? -Nothing. We'd like to go to our rooms, if that's okay. We're dead tired. -I'll have another bottle of red! -Bring two bottles of red. You have to try my homemade brandy. Forty-two degrees, specialty of the house. We really should rest a little. -We had such an... -Such an exciting tour! I'm not going to sleep! I want to drink! -Bravo, Zaki! -Excuse me, just for a moment. He owns everything in Srbobran. This hotel, the grocery store, another restaurant... The gas station... incredible. -He saved every dinar... -Lale! I like him. He's great! You like anyone who buys you a drink! Oh, go ahead and die, see if I care! And now, please... silence in the atmosphere. Resolve the conflict in the swimming pool, please. With us here tonight are artists from the Serbian entertainment industry. Among them is the famous poet, Mr Ljubiae! He performed in the newspapers, television, and he is from Belgrade! Please. Thank you. I'm not really good with these. Our dear... artists. Brothers in arms! You have come on this long journey. You have left your comfortable homes. You have exposed your lives to danger. -Why? -I ask myself the same question. Because real Serbian blood flows through your veins! Blood that cannot remain cold before your brothers' pain and suffering! -I'm going to vomit, I swear! -What are you going to do? The raft is swaying, it makes him sick. You, too, feel that our Serbian brother is in need of help, now! Right now! When his home is in flames! Right now! When his only child is in the woods with a gun in his hand! Right now! When his offspring have no bread to eat! But how can we, artists, help him? With words? Do words have any meaning? Can words be of help to anyone during these horrific times?! Yes, they can. Yes, they can, indeed! Just one kind word from your fellow man! It can mean more than a can of stew! More than a pack of cigarettes! More than a pair of woollen socks! It can be worth more than diapers! And even more valuable than water! -My sweet Sonja... -What do you want? What's this on my forehead? I don't know, and I don't care. Who did this to me? -Let me sleep. -Sonja... Do you have some ice for this? Zaki, if you could only see yourself. Do you even realize what you have turned into? Sonja, don't be angry with me. Your Zaki loves you. Leave me alone! Zaki, what are you doing here? You need something? Do you have some ice? I hit my forehead. I got a bump here. It's nothing, Zaki! Are you OK? We just glue it here... -Woman, bring some sweets! -And some ice, please. Whiskey? No, just ice. Or maybe, just a drop of whiskey. -Woman, whiskey! -And some ice. Take it easy, Zaki. Pick that up. How about a biteto eat? -I only stopped by. -Arrange some cold cuts! Who's this? -My wife. -Your wife? Yeah, right! She really is my wife. If I were you, I would exchange her for two eighteen-year-olds. Let's not go there. Tell me something... Why do you, peasants, like women with moustaches? Let it go, Zaki. Just have your drink. And with hairy legs... could you please explain that phenomenon to me? -Don't talk like that, Zaki. -No, really. Does that turn you on? Get out. Now it's really enough, you fucker. You thinkyou're special,just because you monkey around for a few pennies. Monkey around? What are you talking about? I'm talking about you, you piece of shit. You think you're a big shot, because people recognize you on the street. -Because you're on TV. -Ma'am, what does this guy want? I can rent people like you bythe dozen! Like a rent-a-Car! To dance in my house, to act in my bathroom while I take a dump! I am not rentable! I am... You are my dick! An ordinary cock! No, you are my dick. -Is that so? -You bet! -Is that what you said?! -I said that you are... My huge... remarkably exciting... dick. I let you into my home, Zaki, in the middle of the night! "Danilo, I want whiskey" I give you whiskey. "I want to eat, Danilo" I give you food! "I want ice..," You want ice, Zaki? Here's ice! Here's the food! Here's the whiskey! Here's more food! Fuck it all! Get out of my house! You think you can fuck around with me! -What's wrong with you? -What, what's wrong with me?! -I was just kidding... -In my own home! Fuckyou, and your Shakespeare! Let me go! Let me go! I'll show him! He's just an actor. A tiny bug, smaller than a child's fingernail. Anyone can squash him. Remove him from the face of the earth, and be left unpunished. You don't need to threaten him, let alone beat him. All you need to tell him is "Hey, you over there!You don't have a clue". And he will collapse like a tower of cards. Fuckyou, all. I don't want you in my premises. Just as I had fallen asleep. This really is too much. You, Stanislav, are a blooming idiot! Why me? Who takes care of the hotels, who's the tour manager? -Zaki screwed everything up! -Who? Me? Unlike the rest of you, I have my pride! I will not be insulted by every scoundrel that comes along! Looks like Djuro's not there. He's sleeping. The windows are steamy. -Mr. Djuro, will you please... -What is it? We're going to Belgrade tomorrow with you and Mister Ljubiae. -Yeah, so? -How can I put this... -We don't have a place to sleep. -What am I supposed to do about it? To let us into your van, that's what! Or we're gonna freeze to death! Why don't you say so, man? Hop in! Wednesday, December 1 5, 1993 Muslims. -The ones that are tied up? -Yes. -Who are the guards? -Also Muslims. I don't get it. The ones that are tied up are Babo's. -Whose? -The prisoners are from Kladusa. The guards are fighting against them, they are from Tuzla and Bihaae. What are they doing here? Our side is letting them kill each other off!They don't get involved. Why are these Muslims doing this to other Muslims? Narcissism of small differences. What? Sigmund Freud. Maybe we should get going. -I can't go without a travel order! -Who's got that fucking order? -The Artist. -Who? -Who's the most prominent artist here? -I don't have the order. -Ljubiae? -Exactly. Who knows where that idiot is now. At the front lines. He has that... Iiterary... evening. -At seven in the morning! -Listen... All I know is that tomorrow I have to transport two boxes of Baltic. Baltic means that Ljubiae has a literary evening. -What's a Baltic? -Vodka, my dear. Baltic vodka. There is a feast in the Serbian household. The Serbian hero is the host. A true celebration! Pure honesty shines like beams in a topaz. It is like a spark in the mirror. The soul is filled with happiness! Like a spring in the open sea! Like champagne in crystal. Here, Serbian is thought and spoken! Here, Serbs proudly sing. Not all of it is of the earth, but there is something from above! It ignites this celebration with its heavenly rays! Did you notice the audience's reaction? That's because a fighter likes to hear what the poet has to say. He is uplifted by his words, inspired. -Did you write this? -Yes. What? That's Njegos! My friend read that for our diction exam! I fixed it a little, adapted it. -You reallyfixed it. -Yes. Thanks for coming. I have to go now. -We're going, too. -Wait! -Ljubiae, what about us? -You want to go to Derventa with me? Derventa? You said we were going to Belgrade. I have a performance on the front lines. The situation there is grave, they need my support. -And Literary Club? Custard cakes? -Custard pies. Derventa is practically on the way. We go there, support the fighters, and then for the custard pie. How aboutthat? Great! Ljubiae, please, let's go. It's obvious there will be no literary evening. We really can't go any further. If we could only deliver them the vodka. How many bottles of Baltic do we have? Two boxes. At least that, since I can't... -Let's get out, while we can! -No way! We deliver the vodka or we don't go anywhere. -I'll take the Baltic. But we go now. -Are you crazy?! -What's he doing? -Removing the antennas. -Whose mines are those? -Ours. He has to disarm the mines, so we could go further. We don't have the key, so he has to do it the hard way. -What do you mean?! -It's simple. He unscrews it from above and pulls out the pin. It's crucial he pulls it vertically. Get it? -I get it. -Yeah, I bet. Look. What fucking idiot put an AP next to the anti-tank mines? Mile! Is it bad?! It's bad! I hate losing a man this way! Medics! Call the medics! Hello! Can you hear me? Grujiae bought an AP! Send me a medic! Now! Do you hear me?! Now!! Hold on, Mile! I'm coming! Cover me! Mile, hang on! The medics are coming. Commo!Where's the med... He's dead. He's dead! You knowwhat I had realized here, on the field, among soldiers? No, what? That we cannot lose this war. -Do you know why? -I don't. Because God is with us! The entire world, America, Germany, France, is conspiring against us. Only God is not! He has been on our side the whole time! Really? Could you please explain that to us? I'm really interested. How come the entire world is against us, yet only God loves us? It's very simple, young man. The Serbs are a holy nation. -What are Serbs!? -Holy nation. By the will of God, they came here. The Serbs came here with the rest of the Slavs. That's incorrect. -Firstly, the Serbs are not Slavs. -Then who are they? Let me explain. In Sanskrit, "Sora" means sky, the heavenly arch. "Sorbs" is the ancient name for Serbs. They have apparently come to our planet from another place. It is not known exactly from where. But it is clear that they were sent on a special mission. -You don't actually believe that? -Of course, I do! -They kept it a secret! -Sonja, take it easy. The CIA was immediately informed about the scientific discovery. The ruins of Mycenae reveal the evidence. Are you out of your mind?! Or you who talk crap about the "heavenly Serbs" are, in fact, scum! You do it only for the money! Please, young man, what I do has nothing to do with money! I love my nation from the bottom of my heart. You people created this war, you idiots! You poison the masses with this Nazi crap! You drive tens of thousands of young people to their deaths! You profit, but what makes it worse, you believe in all that crap! Yet you still chose to sit in your cozy homes or in some remote hide-out! While boys vanish off the face of the earth! Fucking Fascist bastard! -Mind your manners, please. -My manners?! -How about your manners, you fuck?! -Don't! You, fascist pig! -Misko, don't! Lale, please, don't! -Motherfucker! People, stop it! Djuro, what's wrong? -Did the van brake down? -We've strayed from the corridor. -We're lost. -What do you mean? -You mean, we can't... -Be quiet. -Be quiet! -It's nothing. Why are you all... -I'll be damned, there's pussy here! -What do we do? -What do we do? -This is a gift directlyfrom Allah. Sir, let me explain... You're as pretty... as a picture. You know, we are actors. Maybe you have seen theTV series "Circus in the House"... Zivorad Kutlesiae plays there and missus... -Sonja Hermann Kutlesiae... -Just Hermann. And myself... Misko. Officer, I kindly askthat you behave in accordance with... you know... Are you that... writer? Yes, he's a writer. -The one that... -I wrote "When Spring ComesToo Late". -Then, "Ripple ofThought"... -I don't give a fuck about that! -But, were you on TV? -I was. I am a regular guest in the programs like "Prose"... -In "Midnight Nocturne" I... -Not that. -But, when it started. -Who started? -What? -The fucking war! -Did you call for ethnic cleansing? -Me, call for ethnic cleansing? -That must be a mistake, I never... -Yes, you did. I watched you on television. At that rally in Bjeljina. When you said that all us Muslims should be... That was him, wasn't it? No, you must be mistaken. No, it's true, you're... Ljubiae. Are you... Ljubiae? I'm not. Yes, you are. Get out. Get out, all of you! Let me... explain! I've nothing to do with it... I don't knowwhere these books came from! Look at the photograph: it's not me, it's someone younger! Anyone can see that. Wait! Explain to them it's not me! Explain to this gentleman that it's not me! I am someone completely different! Misko, please... people, wait... Don't, please! Please, wait! My dear ones... my dear ones! Do you know... How much we used to love you? And all that Belgrade talk? "Fuckin' this, fuckin' that..." If you only knew how much the Sarajevo crowd loved you. And you... Which team do you think I rooted for? For a Sarajevo team? No, man! For Belgrade "Red Star". I went for the games in Belgrade. I even went to Bari, for the European Cup final. And you... You were my idol. Oh, yes, you bet you were. I used to think you can do anything. I would've given you my sister, if you asked. And my bike... and my dog. Take it all, big man... it's yours. Listen, mother... hear my thoughts. I am resolved to die. This I fain would do with honour. Dismissing from me... ...what is mean. Turn thythoughts, and with me weigh howwell I speak. To me the whole of mighty Hellas looks. On me the passage o'er the sea depends. On me the sack ofTroy! And may Helen be punished, and Paris too! It lies to check henceforth barbarian raids to seize our daughters! All this deliverance will my death insure. And my fame for setting Hellas free will be a happy one! Thou didst not bear me for myself alone, but as a public blessing to all Hellas. I have no right at all to cling too fondlyto my life! Now turn we to that other point. It is not right that this man should enter the lists fox a woman's sake. Or that he could be slain. Better a single man should see the light, than ten thousand women! If Artemis is minded to take this body... Am I, a weak mortal, to thwart the goddess? Nay... that were impossible. To Hellas I resign it. I offer this sacrifice... And make an utter end ofTroy. This is my enduring monument. My motherhood. My honour. And my fame! It is but right, mother, that Hellenes should rule barbarians! But not barbarians Hellenes, those being slaves, while these are free! Get out of here. You're free to go. What will happen to Ljubiae? Maybe they'll put him on trial. Yeah, I bet... He'll be released after a fair trial. Really? You think nothing will happen to him? Who has shown any mercy around here?! Who? There is no such thing here. To listen to a man, to try to understand him, to forgive him! Here, it's immediately a knife at your throat! That's Bosnia! Fucking Bosnia... Djuro, do you have a place to stay? No need. I'm going back immediately. -At night? -I'll drive slowly. No problem. -Take a rest before that. -I'll be honest with you. I don't really like Belgrade much. -My folks wait for me over there. -Suit yourself. Have a safe trip back, and thankyou for everything! Good luck!Thanks! Where were you at rehearsal yesterday? We... what was yesterday? Tuesday, and the day before was Monday, when we had the day off. Yesterday, we rehearsed scenes nine and ten. I was... I... -It's written all over your face! -What? That, on your forehead. What is it? You hit the "door"? -What's this on my head? -A bump. -How did I get a bump? -To be in your shoes, Zaki. -Who did this to me? -Did something happen? -Nothing happened. -You seem a bit... -Everything's all right! -Ifyou say so. Tomorrow we've go through the "Prosecution". Starting with Scene One. Good night! -Good night. -Good night. I'm off. -Is there anything to eat? -The canteen is closed. There's food on stage, though. Props. Left over from "The Minister'sWife". No problem. You go on. "The Minister's Wife" has been cancelled. Darko's sick. His appendix, or something. And we had a full house. Terrible! -Thanks! -Good night! -Good night. -Good night. Who is... Darko's substitute for this play? If it's his appendix, that can last for 1 5, maybe 20 days. I know Eeda's role by heart. I played him in sabac. So, I'm available if they need anyone. You mean... No problem, Stanislav. All right. I'll be off, then... Jadranka! I'm... staying. I see. No problem. I have to catch the night bus to New Belgrade. And don't forget what I said about Eeda. If they need anyone. Don't worry, Stanislav, we'll all be pushing for you. Thank you. Bye!
