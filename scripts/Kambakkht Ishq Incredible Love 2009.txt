Come on. - I can't. I just tried. All right. See you later. Man, what a shot! You jumped, and it looked like it was Brandon there. Anything for Hollywood, man. Another great shot as usual. It's a pleasure always doing stunts for you Mr. Brandon. Don't forget about the poker game tomorrow. I'll be there. I'll be there. I think you have a visitor. Not for me. Must be for you. You're the cool dude. No, you're the player. Viraj. Excuse me. Hi, beautiful. You left me in the tub. Baby that was three days ago. But I waited. I'm really sorry. I will make it up tonight. I promise. Oh... Viraj! How is he going to get out of this one? Brother, lots of practice. "I am a bad boy. " Brother, whose house should I take you to? E t me think Phone. We're not deaf, moron. Thank you. Hello. What? Scoundrel! - What the hell! Do you Lucky Doshi take Kamini Sandhu... ...as your lawfully wedded wife? I do. - Do you Kamini Sandhu take Lucky Doshi... ...to be your lawfully wedded husband? I do. I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride. My wabbit. My pumpkin. My tweeny. - My love. Stop! Brother? Brother. Why? Because I love her. Do you know what love is? Brother. - What? Love will clip your wings. You won't be able to fly. It will make your life hell. Kamini is not like that, brother. She's a girl, isn't she? - Yes. That's it. She is like that. "Don't want to love. " You forgot me because of her? You didn't even think about me? "Don't need to love. " - Brother... ...you don't think before you love. You just fall in love. Here we go again. But I never forgot that you are my guru. My everything. But you can't be my wife. What? - Brother, love. I can't have children with you. Why do you need to get married? Why these complications in this simple life? Lucky you know our job is such... ...that if we get married, they will do the stunts... ...with our hearts and our minds. What is it? Hey. Are you happy with her? - Yes. All right. You've made a mistake. I hope you don't regret it. Fathe r, you can say whate ve r you want to. You may now kiss the bride. Brother... - Not me. Kiss her. Stop! Bebo? "Bebo... Bebo... " Bebo? "Bebo... Bebo... " Bebo? - Brother, who is Bebo? - How would I know? "Bebo... Bebo... " Are you out of your mind? Why? - You've destroyed your life by getting married. What will happen to you now? What will happen to your career? What career? I'm just a lingerie model. That's also a career. That's it. You are married. Now forget about modelling. Within days you'll get pregnant. And then kids. Really? Lucky! If you are so fond of marriage and kids, then do it. But why him? What? - What? I mean, if you can get originals... ...then why are you getting married to this duplicate? When you can have any man, why marry this cheap imitation? What? - A body double? Time out! Excuse me! Why should I? Miss... Why am I giving you so much respect? You! Are you here to break up their marriage? Or to insult us stuntmen? Why should I insult those who are an insult in themselves? What do you know about stuntmen? Who wants to know about you? Second-hand people with second-hand lives. Second-hand? We do everything in real, not those heroes. We have the guts. We're fearless, we are honest. We have integrity. You've learnt a couple of English words living in Hollywood. You uneducated, filthy lout! Shut up you stuck up, uptight little witch. I know how to shut up girls like you. Oh, yes? - Want to bet? Really? Fine. How? Let me see what you can do. Beat me? Hit me? That's what you guys know? You can't shut me up. Today, I will speak what I think about you. About your friend. And about this thing. And about your community! You can't shut me up! We are the ones who got married. Why are they kissing? Ove your strawbe rry lipstick, baby. You... Don't. Dog! Witch. "Wretched love. " "Wretched love. " "Don't want to love. Don't need to love. " Brother, what are you doing? Just relax. Brother, you've not learnt anything from me. I've told you several times that women... ...are good for only two things. There's nothing called love. All men are interested in only one thing. What? Please, Sim. Come to your senses. You've been mistaken. Uckkyhas marrie d me, but hasn't e ve n touche d me. Because he knew I didn't want all that before marriage. When he couldn't do anything else, as a last resort... ...he got married to you. So you've not done anything yet? Brother... - You're still a zero. - Brother... Score zero-zero? - Brother... What's wrong with you? Brother, it will happen. It will happen. Take this. Protein shake. I've added Viagra in it. Viagra? - Yes. Brother... Oh, yes. I forgot. You're in love. It's all about sex. And I can prove it. How? Don't let him touch you for three months. But Sim, we've got married... e t's se e how long your marriage lasts. Just test his love. Sim, you'll see. Lucky's love will top every test. Brother, you know nothing about love. Once you fall in love... ... it gets you into trouble. This darned love is like that. Didn't understand? E t me e xplain. Hey! "Kambakkht... Kambakkht. " "Kambakkht Ishq is like that... " "Kambakkht Ishq is like that... " "Once in love, you are doomed. " "Once in love, you are doomed. " "Kambakkht Ishq is like that... " "Kambakkht Ishq is like that... " "Once in love, you are doomed. " "Once in love, you are doomed. " "You are doomed. " "You are doomed. " "You are doomed. " "Wretched. " "She intoxicates you with her eyes. " "She invites you with her dark hair. " "Then she takes you in her graceful arms... " "... and leads you to the gallows. " "Wretched. " "First he come s to you... " "... as if begging you to love him. " "And if by mistake you lose your heart... " "... he treats it like a football. " "You must be foolish... " "... to fall in love. " "Kambakkht Ishq is like that... " "Kambakkht Ishq is like that... " "Once in love, you are doomed. " "Once in love, you are doomed. " "You are doomed. " "You are doomed.

" "She tells you to bring her the stars. " "And then she will marry you. " "Do I own the universe?" "Have I rented a rocket?" "The one who takes the wedding vows... " "... is bound to be ruined.

Someone hit brother with a bottle. - Where? Over there. Brother! Who hit me? Who hit you, brother? - I don't know. I'll beat up everybody. Tiger! Tiger! Brother? Brother, sorry. Brother, no. Stop. Stop! - Why are you hitting me? Hey Stop! Hey Lucky! You! Baby, are you okay? Baby, what's wrong with you? - Brother! Don't support the women! - Tiger, let me go! My wife is crying. Let go! Oh, baby! I'm so sorry. Baby, I can't... I am so sorry. I'd like to thank the groom. And his friends. Sorry. They've done what I couldn't. They've shown Kamini that if you get married to a stuntman... ...you'll get to see all kinds of stunts everyday. Congratulations, guys. Who threw the cake on brother's face? Shut up! Shut up! O ok, have I e ve r askked you for the che que? It doesn't matter if it's late once in a while, dear. Okay, bye. I'll call you later. Who were you talking to, sister Nim? No, Sim. Nothing important. It was Chunky. You're absolutely right. He's nothing important. Bebo... - How often have I told you not to call me that? Anyway, why did he call? I said it was nothing important. When you were going through a divorce... ...and you used to come here and cry all night... ...you used to say the same thing, nothing important. God, Sim. Focus on positive things sometimes. Nim, what's positive in all this? You are unhappy. Mom was unhappy. If there are men involved, then we have nothing positive left in life. What should I focus on? Focus on yourself. And on your life. Hello, girls. Hello, Aunt Dolly. You sisters don't like me at all, do you? What are you saying? There! Same thing again. W he n you call me aunt, it fe e Is likke you're abusing me. Just my name sounds great. I am alone, and so is my name. You shouldn't say such things. You're not alone. The two of us are with you. We're the three musketeers. Always together. Dolly, Sim and Nim. Go away! That's the problem. I don't want to be Raavan, Kumbhkaran and Vibhishan. Nim, Sim and Dim. Sim, you're not normal. At your age, you should have had a four-year-old kid. If you want, I can get pregnant tomorrow. Oh! Sex is easy. But who will get you married? Your aunt? That's the point. My aunt didn't marry, so why should I? Your aunt didn't marry because of you. I was getting good proposals and they're still pouring in. Kapoor has proposed me twice. And he got divorced twice as well. Wretch! If you don't want to get married, then don't. But why are you casting an evil eye on my marriage? I'm still hopeful. Well, forget it. Look what gift I've brought for you. Oh, no! Look what I've brought for you. 'Whenever Aunt Dolly brings something... ' '... she brings me some new trouble. ' Look what I've brought for you. - 'Oh, God! ' 'Aunt Dolly's gift is equal to terrible problem. ' Look what I've brought for you. It's a drape for the wedding gift. It will prove very lucky for you. You'll get a proposal in a jiffy. Proposal? The same thing again? I said I don't want to get married. All right, so don't. It's Goddess' gift. You shouldn't refuse it. If not a wedding proposal, it will prove lucky... ...in your desire to be a surgeon. My name should be in the next roster. They say that I just need to assist in one more surgery. Then I'll be a surgeon. Thank you. For surge ry? - A re you crazy? America, land of opportunities. How much for a hotdog? - Two dollars. One, please. - All right. Yes. - Thank you. What? - Needle! This should be in the haystack not in the hotdog. First you bill me, the n you want to kkill me? You want to be Keswani killer. - No. No. Take it easy, buddy. Nobody's trying to kill you. No. No. What no? You know, you put a needle in the hotdog. I'll sue you. - No... You'll be sued. I will sue you. There's no bigger litigator in all of America. This has never happened before. I have never died before. Death and shit wait for no one... ...they come anywhere, anytime. Sir... - Needle in the hotdog! - No. No. He wants to kill me. - It's all right. - What? Why? - I'll give you the hotdog for free. Fre e hotdog? You're jokking with me? [-=DDR=-] Free hotdog for one life. - Okay. [-=DDR=-] I want lifetime supply of hotdog. - Okay. Okay. [-=DDR=-] W hate ve r you want. Just don't sue me okkay. - You promise? I promise. - Hold this. - just don't sue me, okay? Stand here. - What? - Stand here now. Come on, smile. Smile. Say needle. Hey jack. Italy? Well, no thanks. I'm not taking up any more assignments. I just did that to pay up for med school. But thanks anyway. Bye. Aunt Dolly! Hello, Keswani here. Jhoothlani there? Hello jhoothlani. Coincidentally I met with an accident. God is great. What yes? Do I pay you to agree with me all the time? You've been my lawyer for so many years. You still haven't understood me? Keswani has got a case for you. Yes... This is really a land of opportunities. God bless America. Do you know Sarah made it to the list? Hi. - Hi. Have you seen Dr. Ali anywhere? - No. Speak of the devil. - And the devil appears. Congratulations Ali. You made it to the list. - Yes. Your first surgery. Thank you. And I'm sure your name will also be there in the next list. And then you too will be surgeon. Right? Step on it! Buck up! Buck up! Hurry up! What's this? You're trying to get more fees by delaying. I understand all this exploitation. There are so many needles in my body. Are you going to make a tattoo on me? When will you operate on me? In a few minutes we'll give you local an aesthesia. And then we'll shift you to the operation theatre. Local? Why local? Why not imported? Such discrimination? I understand everything. There's one more thing. Don't mind. You're going to operate on my stomach... ...then why don't you remove my appendix as well? It's right next to it. If something goes wrong, we'll adjust among ourselves. You scratch my backside, I'll scratch yours. Do you get me? Mr... It's not mister. It's Dr. Ali. Doctor? Don't mind. You look more of a nurse than a doctor. Excuse me! - As it is, I don't get along well with doctors. You know what I mean? When I was born, I didn't cry, but the doctor did. Ask me why? - Why? The doctor held me upside down and slapped me twice on my backside. Dad scolded him for hitting his child and sued him. Analyse this. The one who doesn't pee on being born but sues the doctor... ...will become a big litigator. Where are you going? Hello! Nurse! Oh my God. Miss! Your clothes. My towel? - To hell with you! Take it. Uckkyy, you've come afte r a we e k Want some breakfast? What happened to her? Whom? The girl who just left. What did she do? Yes brother, at last night's party... ...I thought the girl was sweet and innocent. Innocent? Did you say innocent? Are you crazy? You should hear her talk. She's so abusive. Her sentence starts with the 'F' word. There's the 'F' word in every sentence. Brother... - Not that word. F for future. She talks of the future all the time. Our future. Your future. We'll do this in future. We'll do that in future, darling. I am fed up. And to whom am I telling this? The one who has destroyed his future by marrying. Tell me, how is sister-in-law? That Kamini. "I am a bad boy. " I haven't touched her since marriage. So will your wife allow you to touch her at an auspicious time? No, brother. I think sister-in-law is suffering from touch disease. Not touch, she has been possessed. Simrita has possessed her. Simrita has told her that if I love her, I will not touch her. And according to Simrita, I don't love her. So I will touch her. So, my lovely, hot, dumb wife has decided... ...that we have to prove Simrita wrong. I am losing out. What do I do? She is so hot! She tempts me all the time. And then she disappoints me. Brother, poor Lucky. Brother, I'm driving. That frigid babe. There's no action in her life... ...and she doesn't allow others to get into action. Brother, how do you know there's not action in her life? I know such girls very well. They look hot, but are cold from inside. But my wife is a sizzler. She's so hot! I can't see anything else but her. What can I do? Be a man. - What do you mean? She is playing games with you. So give her something to play with. Give here a toy. Give her a toy. - Toy? - Yes. Make her pregnant. Give her a child. She'll play with it all her life. Brother, you're joking, right? She doesn't allow me to get close to her... ...and you're saying I should make her pregnant? This is my life, not a mythological episode... ...in which I can look at a girl and make her pregnant. Don't worry. Pray to God. He'll give it to you in a jiffy. This is his. What's this? - God gave it to me. Oh, my God! Move it! Move it! Come on. Bring him. What happened to him? It's a case of milk-o-magnesia. Because of an accident he has lost his memory. - What? Don't you know what amnesia is? Are you illiterate? Memory? Where am I? Don't you watch movies? Who am I, sister? Sister? - Aren't you shocked? Now he will go up. - No! He'll not go to heaven. He'll go upstairs, to his room. The more you love him, the closer he'll get to you. O ok, as so on as he saw you, he smile d at you. Come on... - Go on. Go on. Give him love therapy. Go on. - My baby. Give him love therapy. Go closer. - My wabbit. My pumpkin. My tweeny. My sister. No! Are you crazy? Why are you shouting? Lower you voice. No! No! He has lost his memory. He has not gone deaf. No. No. - Sorry. Okay. Do this. Pick him up and take him. Gently! Remove his clothes. Remove his pyjamas... ...and find your husband. He'll be there somewhere. Come on. Let's go. Doctor? - Doctor. Yes. Little. Dolittle. Dr. Dolittle. Which hospital? Hospital... Hospital Universal. And why are you here? Yes, Lucky. He lost his memory. Amnesia. To solve his problem. What have you prescribed to him, doctor? One Paramount injection with Miramax mixed together... ...and amne sia is solve d. Then you must have got your medical degree from Columbia Tristar. "Bebo... " Brother, shall we remove the wigs? Wouldn't stuntmen become heroes if they knew acting? All fake. All men are the same. Cheats, liars, zero moral fibre, low IQ... You want to see how low a stuntman can get? Kamini, I've not come here to get insulted. Then are you here to insult people? "Wretched love. " Sim! Sim, please. - "Wretched love. " Baby. Baby! Brother... Forge t whate ve r happe ne d. Because believe it or not, we're going to Italiano. You must have heard the saying. - Which? When in Rome, do the Romans. Just imagine. You and me in Milano. Brother, me too. - Yes, you too. The ramps there, and tall eight-foot girls doing the catwalk. Their legs reach up to here. Supermodels. With their soft sleek hands, they will feed us pasta. Brother, pasta with mozzarella? - Absolutely, with mozzarella. Let's go then. - Yes, come on. - Lucky! Brother, you can go. - No. Come with me. No, brother. You can go. - Come on. Come on. Cancel his tickets. - Okay. Sim, isn't it an irony? Do the surgery, and then collect money for the surgery. Money? - Yes, don't you know? $5000 for the registration? You have to give it be fore the first surge ry. I've re ce ive d a me mo. Ali. - Yes. I just remembered. I have to make an important phone call. We'll catch up later. Okay? - All right. Hey jack. That Italian job? Is that still on? Great! I'll be there. Thanks. Hi jack! Oh my God. Hi Tiger. - Jack, hi. Sit, brother. What the heck! - Sorry, man. You? - Yes, me. What are you doing in business class? Show me your boarding card. "Don't need to love. " Bank balance, credit card, property papers, grocery bills... ...would you like to check all these? They're all up there. "Don't want to love. " Excuse me. - Miss, please, take your seat. We're about to take off. Come on, sit. You'll fall down. H urry. Come on. What happened, ma'am? Didn't you take a bath? Excuse me. - Yes. Can I ple ase change my se at? Certainly, miss. Let me check it for you. Seat 2B is free. Hi. Can you just tell me where can I go and sit? I don't want to sit here any longer. Of course, sir. You take that seat there. That one? - Yes. - Thank you. Can I he Ip you, sir? Please, can you get rid of her? Please. Excuse me, ma'am. You appear to be disturbing your co-passenger. Sorry. You? Why are you following me? If I were following you, I'd have had to take the window seat... ...by climbing over you like this. Had I come like this, you would have felt it. Good or bad, you would have surely felt something. Be quiet and don't disturb anybody. Sorry about her. Dog. - Witch. "Wretched love. " "Wretched love. " Cut! Put that in the can! W hat will it takke for you to ge t down? Belisimo! Great reaction. You like it? - Yes. Sure. Why don't you call the female model now? Okay, I'll call. Come on. Nice. Brother! Money. - I know what you're talking about. Excuse me. What? - This is the model? You? What are you doing here? So darling, like I told you earlier... ...you'd be sitting behind him and move yourself forward. And get close to him. Okay? As I call 'Action', feel the love. Fe e I the love. "Don't want to love. " "Don't need to love. " Ma'am, have you come to Italy to die? - What? No, I mean, I have no objections. It's just that the bike is not insured. What? Hold on tight, if you don't want to fall off. And like the director has said, feel the love. "Fe e I the love... " "Fe e I the love... " "Fe e I the love... " "Fe e I the love. " "Fe e I the love. " "Fe e I the love. " "Fe e I the love. " Cut!

You like girls, so I thought... - Why did you even try to think? It doesn't suit you. Iste n to me. - W hat's your proble m? I don't have a problem, you do You have a problem with men. I have a problem with you. - With me? What's wrong with me? I am hot. I am good in bed. And I've not done anything to you. - And you never will. You're not so lucky. Iste n you cre e p! I have no interest in you, any other man or any woman. Wow! No action! I'll die before I let a guy like you touch me, okay? Such attitude? Such attitude!

I'm in the habit of thinking about you first. Not me... ...at least fear God. You should never refuse holy gifts. God doesn't want me to get married, but you do. I didn't say it is for your wedding. It is God's blessing. It is for your welfare. It could also help you in becoming a surgeon. Just wear it. As it is, you don't believe in such superstitions. It doesn't make a difference to you. It's just a watch for you. "My heart beats every moment. " "It beats, but why does it beat so fast?"

Earlier, Kamini didn't let me come close. But at least she loved me. After the memory loss prank, she doesn't even look at me. I sit right in front of her, but she doesn't even look at me. Hi Viraj! - That's because you don't know how to treat a girl. Get it? Girls are special, delicate little creatures. - Viraj. Treat them with love. - Viraj. And they will run after you. - Wait. And be a man. - Viraj. Remember, be a man and they will fall for you like this. Where's your phone? Hello. Hi, is Lucky there? Who is this? 'This is jackie. And you must be his sister Kamini. ' ' Uckkyy told me I'm going to ge t luckkyy tonight at the club. ' What? Hello. Simrita. Excuse me. What kind of place is this? Why? It's not nice? This place is sleazy. Jackie, this is our brother. And... - Hi. It's not me. It's him. You carry on drinking Didn't you tell her that she has to flirt with him? Don't worry, brother. She'll be all over him as soon as sister-in-law comes. But does she know to act? I won't be able to do anything in front of Kamini. She has to do everything. Brother, I... - Don't worry. She's an actress from the union. She'll be good. Brother, she's not from the union. The one from the union was asking for 800. I picked her from the street for 80. Just to save money. - What? She's probably run up a bill worth 800. Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Brother, she threw up on me. Go wash it. Just take her away. Go on. Just go. What kind of girl have you got? For 80 dollars what do you expect? Are you okay? Okay, there. "Lucky... " "Lucky... " Don't you think this place is a bit sleazy? What do you expect? Where else would your husband hang out? Look Sim, whatever happens, my Lucky is not a bad guy. He loves me very much. "Lucky... " He'll not do anything wrong. He'll not break my heart. "Lucky... " Sim, this place is not all that bad. Iste n, the y are playing spiritual music. It's not that bad. This is not spiritual music. It's Aunt Dolly's gift. This watch plays this music every hour. Police! Officer, just a minute. Kamini, you? I... Brother, let me handle this. Sister-in-law, the thing is... - just shut up. Kamini, it's not what you think. It's just that... I was here... Since Mr. Doshi doesn't want a divorce... ...and Mrs. Doshi doesn't have any clear grounds for seeking it... ...I give you three month's time to reconcile your differences... ...and also recommend counseling. Case adjourned. Brother, Lucky. Everything is over, brother. - Nothing is over. The court has given you three months, right? The divorce will happen if there is no reconciliation.

Mother, what is she doing here? She's going to be operating. She'll operate? She's a model. "Don't want to love. Don't need to love. " No. She can't operate. I've not come here for a ramp walk. She can't operate. She can't even wax properly. He's just hallucinating due to pain and anesthesia. How much profile have you given him? Give him 5cc more. No 5cc. She's going to kill me. Mother.

I'm going home. How can you leave? - How can I? Watch me. What? Hey, don't touch me. I... I mean... - What do you mean? I have to check. I have to watch you. You've made a hole in my belly. What else do you want? Viraj, why don't you understand? No you understand. Had I known that you'd operate on me... ...I'd have died instead of allowing you to operate on me. Just try to touch me.

Excuse me... Dr. Rai, how could you be so careless? Nimrita... - Why did you put an innocent man's life in danger... ...just because of your personal differences? Why did you ruin your years of hard work? Why Sim? Sister Nim... - Don't call me sister. I can't be your sister. Sister Nim! Sister Nim? What happened? I was just practicing 'Shavasan'. Sorry. I had a bad dream. You are doomed. Do you think I don't know that? But what should I do now? What will happen to me? You? What will happen to the one who has a watch in his stomach? Sim, what will happen to him? If there is an infection, he's finished. And even if he doesn't, he'll be in trouble. He'll be pissing blood. He'll be... Sim, if the watch reaches his lower intestine... ...he won't be able to pass his stools. You'll end up in jail and your career will be finished. Ali! - Not Ali, now only God can help you.

Kamini, I know I've hurt you, but I'm really sorry. I really love you. But Simrita says... - She can say anything. Can't you takke your own de cisions? Sim was right. You stuntmen! - Witch! Kamini, I'm sorry. Kamini! Kamini! I'm... Whatever it takes, I'll bring him to the hospital. And operate on him. Why will he come? He hates you. And you don't know his number either. No, Simrita, you're doomed. I have Lucky's number. I'll call him. Brother, I remember my promise. No matter what it takes, I'll reunite you and Kamini. Don't worry. It's futile. Kamini is not the problem. It's Simrita. Hello. Hi. - Kamini? No. Simrita. What? Simrita? Wrong number. Lucky! Lucky, listen. I want to ask you about Viraj. Ask what? Whether brother is alive or dead? I'm sorry to inform you. I'm sorry to disappoint you rather... ...brother came back alive after you operated on him. Lucky, why don't you understand? I am Viraj's doctor. I want to do a post-op check-up on him. The stitches have not been removed yet. He could have an infection. Oh, God! He could have an infection. Why is she being such a pain? - Pain? - Pain? Where is it paining? Where is the pain? Why didn't you tell me before? Oh, God! 'Shanti' (Peace). Hello. Who is this Shanti? Your sister-in-law. I thought her name was Simrita. Man, tell him to stop. Else I'll break his legs. I swear I will. W hat are you doing, Tige r? Couldn't you find any othe r girl? Could you only find a girl... ...who doesn't give brother any importance? What? She doesn't give me any importance? Obviously. She doesn't give me any importance or I don't. Come on, brother. I know all the girls want you... ...but she's hardcore. Even you can't charm her. She hates you. You carry on please. I'll drive her crazy. I'll make sure she sleeps with me. You're fired. You're fired. Hey, pay her. You're fired. Please go. She liste ns to e ve rything. - Ose r! Nosy cow! - Brother, relax. And then? And then I'll do to her what she did to you. She broke your heart.

Best stunt coordination and or second unit direction... ...for best stunts during an entire film of any genre. And the award goes to Viraj Shergill. And to give away this award, I'd like to invite someone... ...who's not only a superstar, but a legend in the world of action. Now, I'm not really a big fan of his. I just happen to know that his next film is releasing in... ...eight months, 26 days, Thirteen seconds. Please put your hands together for the man... ...the legend, Mr. Sylvester Stallone. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. My name is john Rambo. But tonight, ladies and gentlemen is not about me. It's about the real heroes behind the action. And it's my real privilege to give this award to someone... ...who is my real life hero. To the man who takes the fall as the director yells action. And the good looking hero... ...rolls up in the continuity and dusts himself off and says... ..."I'm your worst nightmare. " It's my absolute pleasure and honour to give this award... ...to a man without whom, many of my recent films... ...would have never been what they are. The incredible, Viraj Shergill. Viraj, why don't you say a few words? When I was a young boy in Punjab, I used to tell my mom... "Mom, when I grow up, I'd like to be Sylvester Stallone. " I can never be Sylvester. Nobody can. But this middle class Indian boy... ...has worked every day of his life to be able to stand next to him... ...on the same studio floor, to be able to take the fall for him. To be able to say... "Look mom, you son has become Sylvester. Look. " "He may be a duplicate, but he has become Sylvester. " In India, whenever something big like this happens... ...we seek the blessings of our elders, our parents or guru. Tonight I'd like to take the blessings of the guru of action. Thank you very much.

But you said you're asking to improve your general knowledge? Whatever the reason might be, do you know the answer or not? If I knew it, I wouldn't have filed for divorce.

But why were you so mean earlier? You too were so mean. That's because you're so hot. And you used to think that you could trap any girl. But I was wrong. In the past few days, I have realised that you're not like that. You're not, are you? No. You know, my dad was like that. My sister's husband is like that. But you are not like them. You're not, are you? No. They think they can fool the girls and take advantage of them. As if girls don't have a heart filled with love. But you are not like them. You're not, are you? Are you? No. What happened? I'm talking too much, am I not? No - So kiss me. You'd said you knew how to shut me up. "Hey you. " "Every breath of mine is close to you. " "Why are you burning from inside?"

Mr. Keswani, this is not your X-ray. Stupid! Idiot! Son of a gun! Give me the good news. Then whose is it if not mine? This is Viraj's X-ray. Keswani, there's nothing here for you. You wanted to say something to me? I want to give you something. Go wear this first. Go. "Don't want to love. " "Don't need to love. " Scoundrel! "Wretched love. " "Wretched love. " "Wretched love.

Don't take his name in the same breath as mine for as long as I live. But you love him, right? There's nothing between Viraj and me. It was just an act. You know how much I hate him. When I was operating on Viraj, I left my watch inside him. What? - I was really afraid. It was the question of my career. I thought I was going to lose everything. When nothing else was working I pretended to be in love with him. I was so worried. I'm not that foolish, Kamini... ...that I'd fall in love with a guy like him. What are you doing here? What were you telling Kamini? The truth! It's such a relief. I was fed up of pretending to love someone I hate. Sim... Dr. Simrita Rai. Now I won't have to hear you call out my name. It feels like an abuse. Now just get out! Hey... Hey, you're just joking, right? You're just joking, right? Kamini, what did I tell you about the IQ of a stuntman? They're just so freaking dumb. Fre akking idiots. Why did you do this to me? I did what I what was right. I treated you like you deserve to be treated. But I deserve you. I love you. We were going to get married. Marriage? Who's going to marry a sick scoundrel like you? God! Just get out. Get out! God, he just doesn't get it Cut! Yes... cut it... - Okay. Great shot Viraj. Moving on. That was a great shot. He loved it. - Thank you. That was a great shot, brother. Viraj. - Hi. - Hi. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? Well, is there anything I can do to help you? Marry me. Marry me. You always jokingly say that you want golden babies. Yes. So what if I say yes. Then? Then I'd say yes. Hey Denise, the shot is ready. Say when and we'll go get a ring. Hi. - Hey. How are you? - Great. - Good. What are you doing, brother? I want to see... ...whether a sick scoundrel like me gets married or not. Why are you trying to remove this ring? What's wrong with it? Viraj gave it to me. Sim, Viraj proposed? This is great. God has finally heard my prayers. Come on, de cide on a date. I've also got a proposal. I will also say yes. We'll get matching wedding outfits. And take our vows together. Stop it! It was a bogus engagement. And for all you know, this ring might also be fake. Fakke? Of course. How can I ever think... ...of getting engaged, married or be in a relationship. After what happened to Nim and with mom? What happened to your mom? You were just a year old when they separated. How would you know? Did your mom ever tell you anything? No. What could she say? Could she say that she got into an arranged marriage... ...because her parents forced her to... ...but she couldn't love her husband? Or could she have said that... ...her husband tried to save the marriage... ...but she was very stubborn? Just like you. She didn't give in to him. Finally, your fathe r gave up and we nt backk to India. And by the time your mother realised her mistake... ...it was too late. Your mom told me all this, not you. She told me to see to it that her daughters... ...don't repeat her mistakes. Do you think I enjoy nagging you to get married? Don't I know that you think I'm just a joke? And that you're putting up with me just because of your mom? I pity you. I'm putting up with the burden which your mom passed on to me. If you had told him the truth... ...brother would have himself come in for the operation. Listen, you know nothing about me. I know everything you did the other night. Just shut up! - Why? Sounds terrible to hear the truth, doesn't it? I feel worse thinking you were ready to do anything that night. But for the first time, my brother controlled himself. He... he didn't... No Simrita. He did not sleep with you. I think he should have. But he didn't do it. Maybe because he loves you as much as I love Kamini. Just because of your ego, you've broken two relationships. Yours and Kamini's. It's our divorce hearing tomorrow. Good luck. "W hy have the flowe rs lost the ir colour?" "W hy have the flowe rs lost the ir colour?" "Why am I so cross with myself these days?" "Maybe in one of our meetings. " "I said something wrong. " "False promise s we re made. " "Because of some excuse. " "I found you, and then I lost you. " "It was my mistake. " "This is my punishment. " "And yet my heart asks why did this happen. " "Why am I so cross with myself these days?" "My story is so blurry. " "That's why there are tears in my eyes. " "As they roll down my cheeks. " "They leave a symbol of my sorrow. " "All my wishes have been shattered. " "It's my mistake. " "This is my punishment. " "And yet my heart asks why did this happen. " "Why am I so cross with myself these days?" "W hy have the flowe rs lost the ir colour?" You may now sign Stop! Are you guys out of your minds to renounce such happiness? And for a stuck up little witch like me? Kamini, you listened to your heart, and fell in love with him. Then why are you listening to your mind... ...when it is time to stick to your love? Don't you have a mind? Can't you even think? Can't you se e how much he love s you? I'm sorry, Kamini. Sorry, Lucky. It's okay. You would have lost your love because of me. And you'll lose your love if you don't hurry up. I've already lost it. He has found true love. And he's marrying her. I just want to see him happy. Crap! Don't you always say that all stuntmen are dumb? I'm sorry that... - It's true. Absolutely true. My brother is just being an idiot. He doesn't love her. Nor does she love him. She's just satisfying a whim. And Viraj? - Brother is trying to prove... ...something to himself. That's all. How stupid! These stuntmen. Lucky, look ahead. All right guys. I don't want any trouble so just back off... ...We need to get somewhere. All right? You should have thought about that... ...before you came into this neighbourhood. I know, but I need to get somewhere. So, just back off. All right? Tell you what... you go and let the chicks stay. Hello baby! Run! Run! Get the girl! Help! What's up, guys? All's good in the hood? You're in the wrong neighbourhood. What's up baby? You want some of this? I know you like it. Come on. Come on. You. You. You. Come on. Thank you. Uckkyy, ge t up. - KKamini. Uckkyy, are you okkay? - YYEs, I'm okkay. Are you okay? - Yes. Where is Simrita? - Simrita? Sir. - Hey, Lucky. Sir, thankk y ou so much for your he Ip. I'll see you on the set tomorrow. You got that, sir. Shall we? Shall we? Shall we? Go! Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Thank you, sir. Kambakkht Ishq. (Damned Love) We gather here today to join Viraj and Denise in holy matrimony. You may now exchange the rings. - Yes. "Om Mangalam Mangalam. " "Om Mangalam Mangalam. " "Om Mangalam Mangalam. " "Supreme lord Vishnu is the holiest one. " "Son of the Raghu dynasty is the holiest one. " - Sister-in-law? How dare you? I mean how could you? I know I have no right... ...because of what I've done to you. And I know it's too late. But all I want to say is that I love you. I'm sorry. But don't marry for the wrong re ason. She's a good girl. She's really very nice. Don't do this to her. It won't be fair. Yes, I know. But I deserve... - You deserve me, Viraj. Excuse me. So what were you saying? - Brother please... Hold on! You were saying something about a guy like me. Come with me. Yes, I was destined to fall in love with a guy like you. I'm lucky that I found you. You changed me by coming into my life. You left, and it changed again I changed so much that I couldn't recognise myself. Please Viraj, don't throw me out of here. I know it was wrong of me to come here. Please try to understand. I was used to living my life on my own terms... ...and taking my own decisions. Right or wrong. I made mistakes and I corrected them.

I'm not dumb, you are. You didn't even know that you loved me. And you... just a minute. Just... Okay. You talk too much. And I know how to shut you up. But I...
