00:01:38,139 That's why I had to go to prison for four years 4 00:01:38,239 -- 00:01:39,985 Even though she survived it 5 00:01:40,826 -- 00:01:42,892 After that it went good for a while 6 00:01:42,972 -- 00:01:44,896 Until I met that 70 year old 7 00:01:45,278 -- 00:01:47,362 "Oh my god" were her last words 8 00:01:47,473 -- 00:01:48,818 Then she was dead 9 00:01:48,998 -- 00:01:51,224 I didn't know her and I didn't steal anything 10 00:01:51,545 -- 00:01:53,569 That damned idea was suddenly there 11 00:01:53,649 -- 00:01:54,933 I just had to 12 00:01:55,234 -- 00:01:56,839 I couldn't explain it 13 00:01:56,978 -- 00:01:59,424 So I went to prison for 10 years 14 00:02:02,330 -- 00:02:05,458 Then the psychologists got interested in my inner life 15 00:02:08,847 -- 00:02:12,577 When they asked me about my dreams, I told them about flowers 16 00:02:12,775 -- 00:02:13,699 Flowers 17 00:02:13,879 -- 00:02:15,163 Always just flowers 18 00:02:15,925 -- 00:02:19,394 Apart from that, I could fantasize in my mind whatever I wanted 19 00:02:19,694 -- 00:02:22,562 It helped me control this urge to... 20 00:02:23,563 -- 00:02:25,690 Just let it all out 21 00:02:46,663 -- 00:02:50,432 Prison exists so one can better oneself 22 00:02:50,894 -- 00:02:56,128 But that urge to torture a human, that's one thing I never could get rid of 23 00:03:44,973 -- 00:03:46,517 If you sum everything up 24 00:03:46,798 -- 00:03:50,227 Then I've been behind bars more than half of my life 25 00:03:50,707 -- 00:03:54,697 Only, I never commited a crime out of pure joy 26 00:03:55,078 -- 00:03:58,447 There was always a little something, that was added to it 27 00:04:55,953 -- 00:04:59,041 I knew, It will happen again 28 00:04:59,403 -- 00:05:00,726 It has to 29 00:05:01,007 -- 00:05:03,432 But this time they won't get me 30 00:05:14,341 -- 00:05:16,205 Nobody came to pick me up 31 00:05:16,587 -- 00:05:18,912 No family, Nothing 32 00:05:19,655 -- 00:05:21,759 I would've been too excited anyway 33 00:05:22,461 -- 00:05:25,388 I couldn't sleep the whole last night 34 00:05:27,550 -- 00:05:29,075 Finally free 35 00:05:37,696 -- 00:05:40,004 I already had a concrete plan 36 00:05:40,204 -- 00:05:42,086 The details were all fixed 37 00:05:42,799 -- 00:05:46,369 Now it was only neccesary to find somebody 38 00:05:46,911 -- 00:05:49,136 But I didn't know where I was 39 00:05:49,476 -- 00:05:51,943 I've lived in this town for 10 years 40 00:05:52,223 -- 00:05:56,454 Only, behind bars you can't get to know a city 41 00:05:56,775 -- 00:06:00,044 My first question was: Where to? 42 00:06:00,472 -- 00:06:03,899 I thought: Where can you meet somebody? 43 00:06:04,601 -- 00:06:08,271 So I went to the first Caf that was open 44 00:06:59,762 -- 00:07:02,267 There were two attractive girls sitting in there 45 00:07:02,890 -- 00:07:04,794 They were still pretty young 46 00:07:05,236 -- 00:07:07,161 But that would've worked 47 00:07:26,690 -- 00:07:30,018 I felt a bit awkward, dressed as I was 48 00:07:31,203 -- 00:07:34,611 But after 10 years of prison, you can't be dressed modern 49 00:07:37,519 -- 00:07:39,483 They stared at me 50 00:07:44,236 -- 00:07:46,221 I was on it immediately 51 00:07:56,588 -- 00:07:58,812 They literally provoked me 52 00:08:01,981 -- 00:08:04,749 My fantasy immediately began to go wild 53 00:08:34,989 -- 00:08:37,956 I wondered how I could approach them 54 00:08:38,337 -- 00:08:40,484 That excited me enormously 55 00:08:41,004 -- 00:08:44,133 I immediately imagined the greatest things 56 00:08:47,821 -- 00:08:50,369 But it would've caused too much attention in the Caf 57 00:08:50,550 -- 00:08:52,414 Everyone would have heard us 58 00:08:52,615 -- 00:08:55,161 That wasn't a good opportunity 59 00:09:38,972 -- 00:09:42,984 It was absolutely neccesary to find a quiet place 60 00:09:44,608 -- 00:09:47,153 and everything would've gone on well 61 00:09:49,158 -- 00:09:51,465 Then a coincidence helped me 62 00:10:16,353 -- 00:10:17,937 - Where to? 63 00:10:18,379 -- 00:10:20,364 Straigt ahead, please 64 00:10:22,809 -- 00:10:25,336 The opportunity in the Taxi was great 65 00:10:25,718 -- 00:10:29,769 It wouldn't be a robbery, I wasn't interested in money 66 00:10:37,931 -- 00:10:42,161 That woman reminded me of my first girlfriend, Anna-Marie 67 00:10:45,128 -- 00:10:47,175 A real whore 68 00:10:49,358 -- 00:10:52,928 I was 14 at the time, and she was significantly older than me 69 00:10:53,650 -- 00:10:55,675 She nearly could've been my mother 70 00:10:56,939 -- 00:10:59,424 We sat on a bench in the park 71 00:11:00,146 -- 00:11:02,312 I had to remove a shoe 72 00:11:02,687 -- 00:11:05,594 She took the shoe away from me... - What are you doing? 73 00:11:06,537 -- 00:11:09,003 she only would return it to me 74 00:11:09,284 -- 00:11:12,010 ...if I gave her a kiss - What are you doing there? 75 00:11:12,191 -- 00:11:15,078 Anna-Marie then took me home with her 76 00:11:15,259 -- 00:11:16,884 She seduced me 77 00:11:17,124 -- 00:11:20,071 That's when I was able to get active for the first time 78 00:11:20,713 -- 00:11:24,183 First I tied her up, then sealed her mouth shut... 79 00:11:24,602 -- 00:11:26,347 Then I hit her 80 00:11:26,908 -- 00:11:29,535 With a belt and later with a real whip 81 00:11:30,718 -- 00:11:32,583 She couldn't get enough 82 00:11:33,144 -- 00:11:35,330 I really enjoyed it 83 00:11:35,791 -- 00:11:39,501 I became Anna-Marie's slave, and it really excited me 84 00:11:41,233 -- 00:11:43,038 Hey What are you doing !! 85 00:13:52,146 -- 00:13:54,292 Nobody had followed me 86 00:13:55,355 -- 00:13:59,426 Where to and how long I'd run, I don't know 87 00:14:00,428 -- 00:14:02,553 I didn't know that area 88 00:14:02,914 -- 00:14:04,858 I'd never been there 89 00:15:41,090 -- 00:15:43,496 The house seemed desolate to me 90 00:15:44,319 -- 00:15:47,086 I wasn't sure if somebody lived in there 91 00:16:15,659 -- 00:16:17,806 I noticed no one 92 00:16:18,106 -- 00:16:19,949 and didn't hear anything 93 00:16:26,513 -- 00:16:28,878 No human soul around 94 00:16:33,911 -- 00:16:37,018 I thought, that's a paradise for me 95 00:16:54,344 -- 00:16:57,110 The house was well protected by the park and the trees 96 00:16:57,551 -- 00:17:00,038 I didn't have to be afraid of neighbours here 97 00:17:00,960 -- 00:17:03,027 The locatin was perfect 98 00:17:03,654 -- 00:17:05,878 No danger of being spotted here 99 00:19:20,601 -- 00:19:22,748 I could hardly breathe 100 00:19:25,014 -- 00:19:26,899 I was incredibly excited 101 00:19:35,341 -- 00:19:38,027 The opportunity to meet someone in here... 102 00:19:38,209 -- 00:19:40,193 nearly made me go mad 103 00:19:46,348 -- 00:19:49,998 I thought I couldn't take it much longer 104 00:20:35,694 -- 00:20:38,622 I was sure someone lived in here 105 00:20:41,370 -- 00:20:42,712 My victims 106 00:20:45,560 -- 00:20:47,344 I was afraid 107 00:20:51,593 -- 00:20:53,140 Daddy? 108 00:20:55,846 -- 00:20:57,229 Not of the law 109 00:20:58,573 -- 00:21:04,107 I was in a state of mind that excluded every kind of logic 110 00:21:07,977 -- 00:21:10,302 I was afraid of myself 111 00:21:17,200 -- 00:21:19,887 Already earlier in my life, I had been in great fear 112 00:21:21,090 -- 00:21:24,881 For example, as a child it was impossible for me to be alone in a room 113 00:21:33,766 -- 00:21:39,762 My grandmother once locked me alone in a dark room for a whole night 114 00:21:41,427 -- 00:21:43,872 I thought she was trying to kill me 115 00:21:54,440 -- 00:21:56,525 That I'd die of fear 116 00:22:01,880 -- 00:22:04,164 The only thing that helped me were those sounds 117 00:22:37,869 -- 00:22:39,516 What luck I had 118 00:22:39,936 -- 00:22:41,559 What luck I had 119 00:22:41,881 -- 00:22:43,966 This house was perfect for me 120 00:22:47,995 -- 00:22:50,240 My plan would work 121 00:25:55,957 -- 00:25:57,060 Mommy 122 00:25:57,341 -- 00:25:58,906 Daddy is here 123 00:25:59,067 -- 00:26:02,314 Don't be stupid, he's long been dead 124 00:26:39,749 -- 00:26:43,078 As a child, I always had to fear for my life 125 00:26:44,182 -- 00:26:47,570 First my mother threw out my father 126 00:26:53,195 -- 00:26:56,064 Then she lived with another man 127 00:26:56,723 -- 00:26:58,248 My stepfather 128 00:26:58,729 -- 00:27:01,134 And she tried to kill me 129 00:27:02,137 -- 00:27:04,365 She wrapped me in wet diapers 130 00:27:04,524 -- 00:27:06,327 and put me in front of the open window 131 00:27:07,210 -- 00:27:10,761 So I should get cold at the window and freeze to death 132 00:27:17,734 -- 00:27:19,278 Sylvia! 133 00:27:28,073 -- 00:27:29,055 Sylvia... 134 00:27:30,540 -- 00:27:31,662 Sylvia... 135 00:27:50,030 -- 00:27:53,096 I was never safe with my mother 136 00:27:54,621 -- 00:27:56,647 She hated boys 137 00:28:00,075 -- 00:28:04,967 For my mother, I was only an attempt to get a girl 138 00:28:06,107 -- 00:28:08,353 She didn't want a boy like me 139 00:28:09,495 -- 00:28:13,526 She developed a real infatuation for my sister 140 00:28:26,076 -- 00:28:28,120 I didn't exist for her 141 00:28:28,922 -- 00:28:32,611 My sister could do with me whatever she wanted 142 00:28:46,721 -- 00:28:49,347 My mother always just laughed 143 00:28:51,574 -- 00:28:55,121 But one time, I caught my sister alone 144 00:28:56,243 -- 00:28:58,570 I really gave it to her then 145 00:28:59,091 -- 00:29:01,176 I wanted to hit her until she was dead 146 00:29:01,357 -- 00:29:05,005 In her eyes I saw that she was afraid of me 147 00:29:05,146 -- 00:29:07,772 That excited me enormously 148 00:29:13,600 -- 00:29:18,533 Because my mother didn't want me, I grew up at my grandmother's 149 00:29:20,699 -- 00:29:24,687 But she always just said that she had to be ashamed of me 150 00:29:25,190 -- 00:29:27,577 That I was a shame for the whole family 151 00:29:28,587 -- 00:29:30,691 Because I was an illegitimate child 152 00:29:40,912 -- 00:29:42,878 She was incredibly religious 153 00:29:43,551 -- 00:29:46,966 ...and to purge the guilt, she sent me to a convent 154 00:29:50,265 -- 00:29:52,112 I didn't want to 155 00:29:56,916 -- 00:29:59,196 But I had to become a priest 156 00:30:38,116 -- 00:30:40,913 We students lived in that convent 157 00:30:41,808 -- 00:30:45,419 ...and the nuns and priests had a farm there 158 00:30:46,351 -- 00:30:48,516 There were all kinds of animals there 159 00:30:49,070 -- 00:30:53,060 One afternoon, I secretly snuck into the barn 160 00:30:53,418 -- 00:30:58,241 ...and used a knife until the blood gushed 161 00:30:59,450 -- 00:31:00,979 It was a pig 162 00:31:01,555 -- 00:31:07,644 It was afraid of me and squeaked so loudly that the nuns came and caught me 163 00:31:35,019 -- 00:31:38,199 After this incident I had to leave the convent 164 00:31:40,726 -- 00:31:44,478 For my grandmother, a world collapsed 165 00:31:44,911 -- 00:31:47,006 She was so religious... 166 00:31:47,973 -- 00:31:50,322 Now I was no longer allowed to become a priest 167 00:33:12,605 -- 00:33:15,824 After the incident at the convent, my mother said 168 00:33:16,535 -- 00:33:19,201 that my family had to be afraid of me 169 00:33:21,591 -- 00:33:24,139 For her, I now was a monster 170 00:33:27,406 -- 00:33:31,235 She punished me by not letting me back to my grandmother 171 00:33:36,290 -- 00:33:40,556 That was because my stepfather decided to take over my upbringing 172 00:33:43,400 -- 00:33:45,206 But he hated me 173 00:33:46,942 -- 00:33:49,254 He was always good to my sister 174 00:33:51,032 -- 00:33:53,322 But He couldn't stand me 175 00:33:53,519 -- 00:33:56,302 She was never treated badly 176 00:33:57,863 -- 00:34:02,157 One time, he hit me so hard, that I had to crawl on the floor 177 00:34:03,123 -- 00:34:07,487 My mother and my sister just stood there and laughed at me 178 00:36:15,205 -- 00:36:18,011 I wanted to take revenge on my stepfather 179 00:36:20,123 -- 00:36:22,887 I wanted to kill him, out of rage 180 00:36:23,953 -- 00:36:25,237 Daddy 181 00:36:25,473 -- 00:36:27,291 But I was too weak 182 00:36:27,548 -- 00:36:29,266 So I had to run away from home 183 00:36:29,542 -- 00:36:31,536 I slept in the park 184 00:36:32,653 -- 00:36:34,982 There I observed a swan 185 00:36:39,268 -- 00:36:41,380 First I strangled it 186 00:36:41,973 -- 00:36:43,966 Then I cut off its head 187 00:36:47,294 -- 00:36:51,658 It was expelled from the flock and didn't go back with them in the water 188 00:36:52,349 -- 00:36:55,508 It lived all by itself in a corner of the park 189 00:36:56,575 -- 00:36:58,490 It liked humans very much 190 00:36:58,844 -- 00:37:00,839 But it was afraid of me 191 00:37:02,270 -- 00:37:06,160 I imagined, that I was taking my revenge then 192 00:38:03,108 -- 00:38:05,161 Everything went wrong 193 00:38:09,092 -- 00:38:10,710 Everything happened to fast 194 00:38:14,127 -- 00:38:17,207 I had it imagined totally differently 195 00:38:17,508 -- 00:38:19,758 Much much more dramatic 196 00:38:23,411 -- 00:38:27,045 At least now I wanted to stick to my plan 197 00:38:27,776 -- 00:38:31,330 First the mother should visit her dead son 198 00:38:32,108 -- 00:38:34,223 She should observe very carefully 199 00:38:34,360 -- 00:38:36,769 ...how he no longer could move 200 00:38:37,540 -- 00:38:39,771 That would teach her some respect 201 00:38:43,403 -- 00:38:47,175 But...she wasn't moving anymore herself 202 00:38:53,429 -- 00:38:56,785 I thought she was playing a
