It's alright, we're quite modern ourselves You can talk to friends, we don't mind. She has no time for friends. She's very hardworking and dedicated. Working for an NGO isn't a small thing, right? Avi works very hard too... Heart surgeons always do. Forget about NGOs she's got a lot of offers from top hospitals Apollo and Wockhardt have also made offers. Same thing with him In the U.S, he had a lot of offers But we were stubborn, we asked him to settle down here itself. And take care of our own hospital. But we were stubborn, we asked him to settle down here itself. And take care of our own hospital. I'm sure you've heard of our hospital? We know it very well. One of my cousins had malaria.. Had him treated at your hospital. Is that so? When we'd been there, it felt like we were in afive star hotel. Wasn't it? We don't have any expectations. Since we have our own hospital, you can just help with that. What else? After the wedding I think supporting him is enough work NGOs keep opening and shutting down... Aunty, one minute. This marriage won't work out. If you're just looking for support, increase your staff. Every area has a medical college There's no shortage of doctors. I don't want to waste your time My time's precious as well. There's an emergency. I have to leave Please have the coffee I made it myself. Sahana! And, the clients have received the repon. We've to be ready for them tomorrow. - Connect with Shiva, he's going to coordinate everything - Definitely. We have to wow them. One second. Yes? - Are you people running a circus?! - One sec...

I pay you to take care of my father! How can you call yourself a doctor? VWII you listen to what we have to say? I'll make sure this ends your career! Sir, I'll talk to him. Shiva" Shiva, just wait a second. Shiva... - Shiva wait a minute! -I don't have time for an apology. I'm not here to apologize. And destroy my career, I just don't care. My only concern is" To find your father, my patient. In these kind of cases, every minute is crucial. I don't want to waste it on you. One more thing, I told you specifically while leaving... ...to keep an eye on him all the time You just left him at the gate and left... You're as much at fault as us. You can help with the search or sue us It's your choice. You heard about Latifs daughter? I heard she eloped! That too on a Kinetic Honda! Which Lat? The guy who sells coconuts near your house. That guy... Oh Yes! Tell me tell me! I remember now. That fair girl, right? But her marriage was fixed, wasn't it? What marriage are you talking about?! I'll tell you what happened... - There's some boy who... - Mother! Those are just rumours... What actually happened that night was... er...that night... Go ahead, what happened? Mother, Look! Sister Nazia... - There is veg food at the wedding, right? - Huh..Wedding? - I requested Razak for rice and curry. - Huh..Razak who? What rice and curry? Who are you?! I think he's a madman on the loose Get out of the car! - Where's Rank'? - Razak'?! We'll be late for the wedding! What wedding?! We're on our way to a funeral! Listen! If you don't get out now We'll end you ourselves. Salim.. Quickly call brother Aarif. If you don't get out now, I'll mess you up right here! You don't know me. - What about the wedding? - Go, go, loaf about some more. This evening, may I... Decorate the sky with the stars for you? That story you had forgotten... May I search for it in the basket of your memories, Unravel it gently and narrate it aloud for you? Where's your ticket? The imprint of your palms on the wall... Are the same lines" That trace the footsteps of your path on this journey. May I unravel the tangles of that maze for you? You are the soul of the ocean; I am the emotion of the waves. I reside within your soul... Why are you looking on the outside for me? Just once, call out for me loudly... I'll echo with an answer from inside you. This evening, may I... I was angry and... It's ok, don't worry about it I looked around here, but no one's seen him Actually, we're wasting time looking in the same place You should ask around your house and I'll look around here. - I'll call you when I find out something. - Alright. Give me a cigarette. Here you go. Here you go. - I'll pay later... - Ok. I'll add it to your tab... - The match started? Did she eat? No, I talked her into having some fruits... Then she felt tired and fell asleep. We have a chance of winning if Sachin plays well. He seems to be playing well. Our bowlers have been whacked. That Balaji doesn't know what ayorker is! He kept bowling full tosses... ...And they kept scoring boundaries. Oh No! Bowled out! He just had to rotate the strike He tries to hit every ball for a six! Stupid fellow! Here comes the snail... He doesn't know the difference between a one day and a test match Last match he scored 15 runs, ...in 50 balls! He should just support Sachin on the other end. Our Dravid should've come... He plays sensibly... No. Last time he won us the match by playing in the middle order. Dravid will play well at any position - Oh No! - Damn! You told your mother you needed a laptop? It's not a problem. I have money from my pan-time job. I'll manage with that. When are your exam results? My exams are in June Oh, in June? We should get an emergency light. Emergency light can't power a TV. Oh? It Can't? I wonder what's happening with the match... ...I just hope Sachin isn't out. I wonder what you two will talk about once Sachin retires When did you wake up Pushpa? The silence between you both woke me up. Once I'm gone... I really don't know how you both will live with each other. The Silence... The grimy silence that paints your worries The hot silence that gives birth to a sigh. Hello? - I needed a phone number... The stubborn silence that ties your eyes blind. The silence" The false silence that gives birth to distance - Hello...Hello The raw silence that does not give any answers. Hello?... The cruel silence that mocks your loss The time for the bitter truth that lurks around... To grow its roots firmly into the ground. The problems of life and living... Teaches a new lesson every passing minute Those forgotten jaded interactions keep resurfacing. Playing hide and seek from within Excuse me sir... We've got the test results. It's Alzheimer's. If this becomes your life, you are doomed, Shiva. Ok I hear you, I understand. But it's your life too, right? If you ever get tensed, just quickly down a peg. Listen carefully, don't get confused, Make a quick escape. Leave it all behind... Dad, I need to talk to you. I got promoted at work. They've offered me a senior position Really? I had no idea Congratulations! But it's in Bombay... So what? You shouldn't pass on this I've heard it rains a lot there... But we'll get used to it with time... - I can speak a bit of Marathi, Hindi... - Actually, I've already accepted the offer. You did the right thing But with your condition... ...shifting to an unknown city is not a good idea This institute deals specifically with Alzheimer's.. Superb facility! Everyone there is of your age... They'll take care of everything... You'll have special care round the clock... Nothing to worry about, you can relax... And I'll visit you regularly... I'll take you there tomorrow, you can see for yourself... And another thing... Please don't get emotional and misunderstand me. I'm doing this for your own good. This has all the details. I'm not any outsider: I am your inner voice Listen, and open your eyes Shiva Leave all those small things behind and soar... The time for the bitter truth that lurks around... To grow its roots firmly into the ground. The problems of life and living... Teaches a new lesson every passing minute Those forgotten jaded interactions keep resurfacing. Playing hide and seek from within Hello? Did you get any information? No. No one's seen him around here. Did you hear anything? N o. I think we should file a missing persons' report with the police. 0k. I'll see you there What do you want? We wanted to file a missing person complaint. Name? Venkob Rao, 66 years old. Tell me your name first! Sir, he's Shiva I'm Sahana His father, Venkob Rao, has been missing from the old-age home near Saraswami Circle since evening Wham was the name you said? Shiva... Not yours! The old man's" Venkob Rao! I told you once already right? You...watch your tone... We're here to help you... So help us! - My are you asking us the same question?! - Shiva just calm down... Look madam... ...Yelling like this isn't going to help anyone. Tell your husband to lower his tone. If not, I'll have to send him out. Sir, he's not my husband I'm a doctor who works at the old-age home Also...He's just tensed that his father is missing... We apologise Does he run away often? Sir, he hasn't run away. He has... He has a medical condition called Alzheimer's Most people just call it forgetfulness... Yes, yes... I know about it... So do you have a photo of his? I do sir. He was wearing alight pink shirt and a red sweater when he went missing... Maroon... It was a maroon sweater. Our old-age home's ID card was in his pocket as well. You say he's got a medical condition. Couldn't you take good care of him? Here, fill in the necessary details and contact number in this form. We'll pass a message to the control room... We'll check hospitals for unclaimed bodies from accidents and inform you If we get any other information we'll call you. But you need to understand... We have our own limitations. \Mth our current man power, it's tough to deal with all the cases. Sahana please stop the car for a minute... Wham happened? No, nothing... It doesn't make sense to search aimlessly. We've looked around your old-age home and my house... I don't think this is working out. We'll try tomorrow. Alzheimer's patients might follow old routines. So, let's follow your father's old routine Let's hope something works out. If my father is following his old routine we would've found him by now. His life was like clockwork He didn't have a life besides his morning walk, office and home Especially, after retirement, he would always be at home with a book in his hand. Extremely boring and ordinary. Venkob uncle was anything but ordinary. Anyways, let it be Contact your family and friends. In situations like this we need all the help we can get. I don't have friends here anymore... And family... ...Nevermind, let's leave That's the house... - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay Venkob Uncle, come on smile. It's your birthday Venki, you look like a villain with that knife in your hand. - Yes he does. - Thank you. Susheel, come here quickly. Shoot the video. Hold it properly, don't shake it. Hold it steady... That's what mom tells me when I'm taking a leak. Oh god... Sahana... - Six and six. Even interchanging the numbers won't help - Sixty six?! Why don't you replace the first six with a 'one'? - You're sweet sixteen is it? - Yes Quit joking Venki. Ravi, sixty six... Don't know how much damage this damn disease will do in another year... Uncle... One year is a lot of time. Stop worrying. - Let's cut the cake - Yes - Susheel, go sit next to Venki. - 0k, I get the first piece. 0k, let's all sing? Happy Birthday To You...

Shut up and do what you're told. Alright brother... Hello? Boss? Everything ok? Everything's fine. The cop at the check-post took 500Rs but nothing besides that. You don't have to worry. We'll finish up and be back in the morning. It's not our first time. Look Ranga, it's a very delicate matter... Nothing should go wrong! In our line of work, your first mistake will be your last. Finish up and give me a call. Ok. Change the number plates by the time I come back. Yes brother: Hello? Hellomsweethean? Had dinner? Yes, I had. You didn't ask me if I did? Why should I? Ok, let it be... Fine, tell me. I ate too... But I don't know why, if I don't talk to you, I don't even feel like eating.

Now that's what I call a movie! Just superb! Like I would get scared... My blood is fear-proof! - He was... - Enough already! How much you talk!

A bit further away from the Dasenhalli checkpost... Listen carefully... Kill them both. And when the time is right... - Kill that boy of yours! - What? But Boss" I've never directly... I've never asked you to get your hands bloody. But you're the one who messed up. So fix it! But Boss" I'll forget the fact that you've been with me all these years... If you want to live, do as you're told. Boss" Brother, what did Prakash sir say? Brother?.. Wham did he say? He told me to kill these two! Sir! Please don't kill me sir! I have a family sir!

I'll ask around and if I get any information I'll call you... Same phone number, right? I'd called you many times, but you didn't answer. So I thought you've changed your number. 0k, I'll take your leave... Like father, like son.. I didn't understand... Your father used to come here for a smoke before boarding his office bus. My father used to smoke? Yes. He would puff his smoke so quickly so that no one would see and then leave.. Why did you never tell me? It's a cigarette shop's policy... I never told him about you and never told you about him. 0k, which brand? Yours was the big king. His was the small one. - One, two, three" - One, two, three" - Laughter gives you a hundred years! - Laughter gives you a hundred years! - One, two, three... - One, two, three... - Laughter gives you a hundred years! - Laughter gives you a hundred years!

Venkob Rao Laughter Club? How would you know? Anyway; what do you want? Can we sit for a minute? Oh, so Venkob has joined the list of missing people. Makes sense though... Poor chap Built a home of his own by taking several loans. If he had lived there, he would've probably been alright. Just because you couldn't look after him You sent him off to an old-age home. Look Uncle... I didn't come here so you could judge me. I wanted to know if my father made any contact with you. If you have any information, tell me. If you don't, then excuse me, I'll leave Your generation's gotten plenty of arrogance. Do you know anything about your father? You would've died as a child... Venkob gave you a kidney to save your life! Go look for him! At least now you'll realize his value Louder! I want everyone to laugh louder. No matter how much I looked, I couldn't find any photo in which he's kept a straight face He always had a smile on him. Yes. That's one thing he did right... Let's add ,Cash Reward' It'll add value to the poster Shiva... Shiva" Tape?... I've some urgent work, I'll join you later... Shiva, what are you doing? Don't you get the seriousness of the situation? It's your father, not some object that's gone missing! Auto!... - No matter how busy with work you are... - Hold on a minute... ...there cannot be something more important than this! Shiva! - I don't know what went wrong between the two of you... - Hold on I'm coming. He might have punished you as a child... Maybe he didn't even treat you like a son... Even if you don't love him, it's still your responsibility to find him Sahana... I've said what I had to say...Now it's up to you. I'll meet you later... - Where to sir? - U B City... - Ok Sir. Shiva, the client's ready. Shiva... Shiva! Sorry... So as I was saying... In the previous quarter there's been a dip in the market. And our solution ensures that you see a lot of profit. That's it gentlemen. It's good Awesome job Shiva! I've heard New York gets cold this time of the year. Make sure you carry a sweater, alright? All your friends are going abroad for higher studies" I know you want to study in the U.S.. But... we spent a lot on your mother's treatment. But ViswanamHs son did his engineering here. - And got a well paying job here... - I'm not ViswanantHs son. And if we're pulling comparisons... Most of your colleagues moved on to bigger things... But you've remained at the same job all your life! I'm going to be lame for my train. I will figure out my own future" I'll be back in two days. Lakshmi... Lakshmi ! Lakshmi... I thought I'd never see you again! - Listen... - I've made plenty of mistakes But God's given me another chance... ...I'll never fight with you again! I wouldn't wish that hell on my worst enemy! I don't even know how I got out of there! - I wanted to see you and our son... - Listen! What? Please come sir. Have a seat. Why don't I tell you how you escaped? Right brother? Adding potatoes to the upma was a nice touch Did your daughter cook this? Daughter? My son is constantly busy with work" Son?! But I'll ask him to come this Sunday - If he accepts we can go ahead and plan the wedding - What's he talking about? Don't you know anything?! How did they get inside the house? Yes! I invited them over... - I'm always lonely at home and wanted some company - Quiet down! Why should I quiet down?! This is our house! How would you know how stressed I was! You have no idea how shaken I was that you hadn't come yet He called me up saying you were in an accident, and asked for the address to bring you home He carried you on his shoulder! We'll go in? Take grandpa inside - Come grandpa, careful... - Madam, your husband's fine" - Just a small accident - Careful. Please come in. Only after they came in did I realise that they're thugs! Give me that! Go inside... Go on! Where's his phone? OK...Where's putta? How did grandpa get into the van?... Speak to him! Wait... Talk! Sir... Brother... He wants to speak to you. Er... Nothing sir... ...Nothing sir, my name's Kumar. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself last night... This is my wife, Lakshmi. I'm the manager of a nearby brick factory. We're a.. a middle class family, sir. We put everything we had into this house and now we've become a lower middle class family. I swear to God... I won't tell anyone about you. I can.. Who do we worship? - Biligiri Ranganamhswamy - I swear to Biligiri Ranganathswamy! Please let us go sir... Even if the po.. police... Even if the police ask me, I'll say I don't know anything I swear... I swear on her! \I\Iaten...? All this has happened because of your damn water! Or else by now we would've gotten rid of the body by now and... Shut up! What's all this about a body?! Nothing! What body? There's no body... The police took the body away, right sir?! You stay quiet! Talking about murders" Sir, please let us go... If you want you can take my car... Or I can drop you anywhere you want! If you go with them I'll come too Let's die together... Who said anything about dying?! Stay quiet... They're all very nice people They're in some trouble, we should help them... Can you shut it?! - You as well! -V\Iham did I... Shiva... You'll achieve nothing with anger. Get up you old fool! - I've been tolerating you! - Lakshmi, he's going to do something! Talk again, and I'll stab you to death. You think we're fooling around? Not a word! Never thought I'd see a knife in my son's hand There's a kid in all these pictures" Where's he? I don't see him... My son... Hari... Va..Vacation... Holidays So he's gone to his aunt's house. Right? So you both were playing with these toys? I swear on Biligiri Ranganamhswamy... ...I wouldn't lie about my son Ma, how long do I sleep on the floor? I'm feeling sick You were trying to lie to me?! I'll kill all of you. This is your last warning. Don't try anything like this again. Oh you..come come Why did you lie to me?! At your age, don't you understand the seriousness of the situation?! Have you lost your mind?! Why'd you make up that story about kidney donation? - Is that something to joke about?! - Definitely. You know how much it messed with my head?! You should've taken a pain killer. Only donating a kidney makes him a father? As a kid, when you used to pee and poop all over the place. He used to run behind you to clean up after you. He wasn't your father then? And what of those thousand questions you have pestered him as a kid? All of which he answered patiently. Doesn't that make him a father? Have you ever played with kids? Annoying brats! The most mindless things one has to do to make them happy. Poor guy, despite slogging the whole day at work... He used to come home and play with you... That was his mistake. Forget that, if he had just left the gate open.. You would've run into some traffic got run over and died. These are too trivial for you, right? You're all grown up now... Come have a drink Hey, you kind-hearted girl.. We've spread the word everywhere, TV also. ~Giving yourself for others comes easy to you~ Check if his son has any leads... We seem to be doing all the searching. Hey, you kind-hearted girl.. Your presence brings comfort to those in pain.. You wear your inner-beauty... in place of ornaments and jewelry. Shiva...? - Hey, you kind-hearted girl~ - Doctor". - Hey, you kind-hearted girl~ - Doctor". I'm up here! - Come up... ~Take my hand..and lead me.~ Please sit. Shiva... My jeans are a little tight... but not as much as me though. I wanted to ask you if you had any leads about Venkob Uncle... Also, the other day... I think I was insensitive and mean.

I'm the owner of the house - What's this about sir? - Let's go inside I'll tell you. - Let's talk here - Get inside man! - Come in - Where's your wife? She's gone to get vegetables. She'd made a late-night call to us, crying, that you hadn't come home. - Does she think we're jobless? Oh her?! She's a drama queen! She watches TV all day long... Like those over dramatic actors... She overreacts for everything. There was an accident on-route to your house. - Did you see anything suspicious? Accident? - Yes, around 12AM. No, sir. 0k, talk to your wife... Ask her not to bother the police every time you loaf around and come home lame. - Domestic quarrels aren't our problem - Sorry sir - Sir? - You said your wife isn't home? what's that sound? - Let's see, make way. - Must be my son. Ok let's see then - But that's my...my bedroom, sir. - Go stand there - What's that sound? - Nothing, you saw for yourself. Right, you must be deaf. Hello, mister... Are you playing the fool with me?

Ambulance?! Wham is he saying? I have no idea, sir. Sir! He's got dementia, he's my father-in-law. My son's a brat! He's locked him inside and run off somewhere - What a son! - Wash your hands! What a family you have! Why do I get such cases... - During a serious investigation - Sorry, sir. You just wasted my time! Idiot. I told you sir, she's a drama queen. - What a nut house! - Sorry; sir. Thanks god! Move aside... Now he comes out and orders me around Brother, am confused, what game is this old man playing? He's not playing... He's lost his mind, must have escaped from somewhere He used to visit us once a month, then suddenly he stopped. I went to your house to make sure he's 0k But it was locked. Thinking that he might be traveling, I sent this letter I had no idea so much has happened... I'm very sorry. Careful kids, slow down - Actually, I have to thank you. - Why? Because, the books you read as a kid... Are now being read by these kids He'd always carry a bunch of your old story books with him He would huddle the kids and narrate stories to them He also instilled a love for an in these underprivileged kids He would sit with them for hours as they drew. When he was around, their drawings would look amazing! And, he would always tell them" When you draw your... - Imagination. - Your imagination... Your imagination shouldn't be bound by the size of the page. Tell me, Sahana Shiva, someone who bumped into Venkob uncle... Called after seeing the missing report on TV. He mentioned 'Razak' to them. Did your father have a friend called Razak? Friends" - Nothing that rings a bell immediately. - Oh... But I think there was colleague of his by that name 0k, Did Venkob uncle have a phone-book or diary? We might get some information there If there's a diary or phone-book, It should be here. All my father's old stuff is here. I'll look there You made these? They're very good. When I was a kid, sketching was my favorite hobby. Drawing gave me immense joy"... All I needed was an empty sheet and crayons. I used to spend hours drawing... Mom would constantly nag dad about spoiling me with crayons and paint. Now? You don't sketch anymore? I don't even use a pen anymore, where will I have time for colors? But very nice" You've collected and preserved all of this" I haven't. All that is my father's doing. Wham happened? The day he went missing... He had picked up a packet of color pencils Shiva... A book fell behind this thing... One second. Ya, push. Shiva, look at that. After mom passed away... I had the whole house painted But this space alone... Must be my father's idea! I still remember... I was in second standard, it was a holiday. I was bored of drawing on paper and wanted to draw on the wall. Mom was asleep, I took the paint she'd hidden and drew all over the wall! Mom saw what I did and thrashed me. She scared me that dad would do worse. But after dad came home" He asked me why I'd left this space empty... Then dad and I did this together'. Mom got so angry with dad... It was like world War 3! Thou its my father who has this disease, it's me who's forgotten everything The nicer memories are like this hidden away somewhere - Ya ma? - Sahana, where are you? - I'm coming - They'll be here any minute - Ok ok... - Don't be lame - Alright, I'm on my way - Come soon. I have to leave, Razak's details are in this" Call him and check if he's heard anything. Shiva... I'm glad I got to see this - Bye - Bye Shiva" have you ever thought of it? We think our story begins with our birth... But it actually begins in the middle of someone else's story. 0k... forget that. I'll tell you the story behind yours OK go on. But I'm warning you right now, I'm not as good as your father. Fine During his final year of BSc... He saw your mother for the first time at the canteen. He used to say something... \Mth one glance" We knew we wanted to share the ups and downs of life. She was beautiful... And she was very shy... she would rarely look up She would occasionally laugh... And that laughter... For six months I eagerly waited for her to notice me Finally one day, I decided I must talk to her. I went and stood in front of her. As I stood there... She looked up and our eyes met. I felt like I was stuck by a lightning! I froze like a stone. Stop pulling my leg with some film story. - No I swear to you. - Swear on me? - Listen to the story no? - Fine... And then? Wham then? I was such a coward... Not knowing how to face her, I didn't go to college for a week! Then, one day I sneaked into the canteen, but she wasn't there.. I went to her classroom, she wasn't there either... I searched every pan of the college! But I couldn't find her... Just when I began to wonder if she was my imagination, it hit me... There was one place where I hadn't looked. Do you know which one? Let's see if you can guess" Ladies hostel? That's the difference between your generation and his... And which generation are you from? All this time with old people has made you old. Do you want me to go on? 0k, where? Library... I didn't even know where that was" Since exams were around, she was almost living in the library. So he started going to the library everyday. He would pretend to read a book and look at your mother all day. - Then I started reading the book in my hand... - What?! Wham happened? He was reading in the middle of his own love story?! He told me the whole world... He used to tell me that one can see the whole world through books Although... I wondered how such beautiful worlds and stories were brought to life by just words... Used by these writers and poets I put my book down and Pushpa was sitting right across me. He found the answer to that question in her eyes Mom didn't say anything? No... she didn't talk. She waited for me to say something. I didn't, she finally left. - And then, what did you do? -And then... - Letter... - Ya, and then... Both of us didn't speak, sol decided to write her a letter. I wrote one" and gave it to her. Where was she when you gave her the letter? - She" - Her aunt? She lived with her aunt. How did you get there? - Cycle? You rode" - Ya, I went by cycle" I made sure she looked when I put the letter in the post box. And then? - Her aunt... -When her aunt left the house.. She came down and took the letter. She looked around, no one was around, She opened the letter... - Her joy disappeared instantly! - Disappeared? . My? . My? 'NW? He was so tensed, he didn't realize that it was raining The soaked letter didn't have words, just ink. - And then? -And then? He kept cycling... - Everyday I would cycle" - To her house? I would ride around her house I would look at her, she would look at me. And then, the villain enters" We didn't know that her aunt was also looking. But these two had no idea... So as usual Venkob uncle... went to see your mom but she wasn't there. I waited day and night... I went to knock on her door, but... The house was locked. College reopened, but she didn't turn up No clue where she was! I kept thinking what might have happened? What might've happened? I kept wondering what might've happened. Finally... I went to the library... Amidst the novels I read... There was a physics book with her name on it. When I opened it... I found my empty ink stained letter... Filled with new words from her. I'm going to my village for ten days My father isn't keeping well..." "He's admitted to the hospital." - Your Pushpa, She had written ,Your Pushpa, Your Pushpa! I've lost count of the time; I've read those words. Now, I had to see her! So I went to her village Once I went there, I found out the truth There was nothing wrong with her father! He lied! She was being forcefully married! Wham could I do? I couldn't think of anything I went to the bus stand... Then I remembered... "Your Pushpa" I realized I was making the biggest mistake of my life. I went to her house again. They fought with me, beat me up... I fought back! I just went and stood in front of her. I asked her, ,Al'1\Mll you marry me PushpaZAfi That was the first time I spoke to her! She said yes! I held her hand and dragged her out of there! She said yes! I held her hand and dragged her out of there! Yes I took her away... - Then? - Then how did anything matter? They married at a temple For two and a half years, they never spoke... Except through their eyes And they got married! Such a romantic love story! I had assumed that my father had an ordinary life. But in comparison... My life's quite boring Searching for him.. I've realized that I am completely lost. I lost my father many years ago... But now, I feel like I've found him. I just want to see him once. Hey... We'll find him. Anyways, one more cup of tea? Oh yes please, definitely. - \Mth less sugar. - Alright. Don't forget to bolt the door properly Boss I... Did you finish the job? I couldn't find the right time" What? The right time?! Keep waiting and your time will be up" If you don't have the guts to do it, I'll send Pamil. Where are you now? No need for that...I'll do it myself. Finish it then. I'll call you tomorrow. Keep waiting and your time will be up...Finish It. Shiva, did you call the doctor? Brother! Get lost! - Hello? - Hello? Is this Shiva? - Yes -You'd reported Venkob Rao to be missing, right? We've found a body. You need to identify it. The body was found on a railway track... Please come... These old people are so careless... They cross railway track like its a road. Nothing's happened to the face, so you'll be able to identify him How are you related"? Wham are you doing there?! Come with me. We've other things to do. This is the worst job ever... He'll show you the body. Identify and let us know. We'd filed a missing persons report for 'Venkob Rao'. Any information about him? When I... When I got a promotion... I had an option... I could've stayed in Bangalore, but... I ran off to Bombay... What's the point of regret at this point? I've been so selfish! Venkob uncle's missing, that's it. We haven't given up. You haven't lost him yet. I'm confident we'll find him I've never thought about him... ...if he was ok?... ...if he was doing fine?... ...if he was happy. But now... ...I keep wondering if he's getting something to eat... ...if he has a place to sleep... The painful thought of of him being alive or not is killing me. After seeing that corpse at the mortuary... Wham if my father also... Shiva, I'm sure Venkob uncle is safe... It's just a matter of time Shiva... Please... We'll surely find him Shiva... Shiva please. We'll find him... please. I've been noticing you... Something has been troubling you. There's two kinds of dogs inside us... ...One dog is black, and the other is white Revenge, anger, lies, fear, selfishness... ...these are attributed to the black dog. Love, compassion, peace, truth, selflessness" ...these are attributed to the white one. Both these dogs are constantly fighting each other inside us I've been wondering all day... Do you know which dog wins? The dog you feed more wins You understand? I'm going to sleep... You get some sleep too Shiva. Is the job done? Yes. I've killed them all. - The bodies? - Disguising a murder is my job, right? The police are extremely alert. - Where are you now? - In a lodge near Dasenhalli railway station. Stay put, don't come out. I'll have you picked up tomorrow night. Be careful. Stay in Bombay for a while. - I'll call you back when the time is right. -Alright boss Go there tonight... Kill him What can we possibly do... We're going out, come on. Sir, where are you taking me? My wife and kid at home... You drink? Er...My wife" I asked if you drink? Brother, hand me the cigarette. Here you go. Now... I feel brave" - Brave? - Yes - To do what? - Nothing You there! Bring us another half bottle. Order a full bottle... I can drink all night... But wont flinch a bit while stabbing you. Stab me? Just you wait... Sir... Wham do you do for a living? I mean, your business...? Why do you want to know? What fun is drinking without small talk. Sol was just asking... There's no need to talk when one can drink. No talking even while drinking! That body in the vehicle" Did you...? Who was that?! Lower your voice F'.! F%-A-A-k%-k? Where were you taking the body? Aren't you afraid of doing such things? Oh god... Sir... Do you've a family? Let's go. Thank God, it's completely dry. Poor Reshma. Please switch on...

I would've picked you up if you'd called. - I've some work at the station, let's go. -Alright sir. Who was that? My life is no different from that of a dog" All that loyalty counts for nothing. Killing me like I am some rabid dog! F#fil-A%! Killing you? Wham are you saying? Look, I saw an accident and I rushed to help. The body in your vehicle, your job, the man who's come looking for you... I have nothing to do with this! Please leave us alone.

But, we cannot let these things get to us We must keep looking" 0k? The winding road... Chaos is fast approaching... Making me go in circles" Those forgotten days... Full of memories.. seem like a second. Sahana? I had to ask you something... You'd mailed a video of my father's birthday It ended abruptly Do you remember what he wished for? Before his condition deteriorated... He'd make that wish every opportunity he got. What was it? That you should find a nice girl... Have a small family and live happily ever after. He used to pester me to get married, showing me photos of random girls If allowed, he would have married me off in my sleep How can one decide by just looking at a photo? The winding path is ahead... - 0k, I'll call you. Turn Right. - Wham did he say? The police there said the same thing... Any luck? But I've called you repeatedly! Chaos is fast approaching...

Who are you looking for? I'm Sahana's mother. - Please come in. - Sahana's wedding has been fixed... Please stay away from her. Oh fading light of the evening sky... Why did you leave me behind in the company of the night. The light of the candle is tormented... By the thousand desires of the blowing wind. Why are you dragging this wandering existence... Further away from the light. Lead me through this encompassing cloud of uncertainty... Into a place where I can feel your light. Venki Venki, what did you wish for? What else will I ask for? I hope my son finds a girl like Sahana Why someone like Sahana? Sahana's here, why don't you ask her?! Ravi, that's what I did. Why don't you try asking? - Venkob Uncle! - What do you say? You people are so jobless. Here I am calling out to you... Pleading to you.. Oh, light at the edge of the sky... I stand here alone and defeated" Can you even see me from there?

His sonjust called. Ok sir! Thank you... Thank you so much! Today, I've found all the memories that you've lost. You saw mom for the first in the canteen. You looked for her all over... You ran away when mom looked at you, right? Running behind her, you failed thrice in exams Dad, do you remember this? You visited the library just to see her. She was sitting right in front of you You remember cycling around her house? Who's that? He felt helpless and boarded the return bus. He realized life would be meaningless without your mom. He stopped the bus and went straight to her house And there... I wanted to talk to her. I gathered all my courage and went to her. I wanted to talk to her. I gathered all my courage and went to her. The twinkling of the star... Has become the light of my life. This lingering melody... Has become a song of love. She looked at me...Our eyes met! I felt like I was stuck by a lightning! You have become my life" My breath... Sailing through emotion; you came to me as a dream. With this confluence of our souls... - Sahana... will you marry me? -A new story begins. \Mth one glance" We knew we wanted to share the ups and downs of life. Its a celebration of love And this story will go on forever...
