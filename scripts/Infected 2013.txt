IT SPREAD FROM TICKS, THROUGH BIRDS AND DEER TO HUMANS. EVERYONE IS A CARRIER OF ONE STRAIN OR ANOTHER, ONE STEP AWAY FROM A DEADLY COMBINATION, A TICKING TIME BOMB. YOU CAN TRY TO CONTROL THE FEVERS, GIVE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM A CHANCE, BUT YOU'RE FIGHTING THE UNKNOWN, SOMETHING THA WILL RIP YOU APART FROM WITHIN, SOMETHING ANIMAL, SOMETHING INHUMAN. BEFORE WE CAN REBUILD, WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO SURVIVE OURSELVES, A WAY TO FIGHT. [bluesy rock music] [door rattling] [gun cocks] [pounding and rustling] [glass shattering] - THEY'RE EVERYWHERE, LOUIS! EVERYWHERE! [glass shatters] [driving rock music] - [whimpering] WE'RE GONNA DIE! - YOU SHUT UP! YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP! RIGHT NOW, WE ALL GOT TO KEEP OUR HEADS. IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR THAT. WE HAVE TO FIGH AND SURVIVE! WE GOT TO BUTTON THIS PLACE UP AND COVER UP THESE DOORS AND WINDOWS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS OUT THERE, BUT IT'S COMING BACK. IT'S COMING BACK. COMING BACK. IT'S FUCKING HUNGRY. WE'RE NOT GONNA DIE. I'LL KILL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE SONS OF BITCHES. ANDREW, GO FIND EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO PUT ON THESE DOORS AND WINDOWS, TABLES, CHAIRS, ANYTHING. MATT, YOU WITH ME? - [groaning and panting] I AM STILL IN ONE PIECE. - WELL, STAY THAT WAY. GO GET THE AMMO. LOAD UP THE GUNS. - LET'S DO SOMETHING. - DON'T ANYBODY DO ANYTHING WITHOUT TELLING ME FIRST! - EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. [glass shatters, roaring] [twangy acoustic guitar music] [knife pounding] [gun cocks] [gun cocking] I SUPPOSE YOU'RE... JUST GONNA STAND AROUND MOPING ALL WEEKEND, HUH? - THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE PLAN. - THAT'S TOO BAD. I WAS KIND OF HOPING MAYBE WE'D HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THINGS AND HAVE A FEW LAUGHS. I'M A FUNNY GUY. [laughs] RIGHT? I TOLD ANGELA THIS WASN'T GONNA BE A GOOD IDEA, THIS WHOLE WEEKEND. - THIS WAS HER IDEA? - YEAH. - [scoffs] WOW. - YOU KNOW, SHE'S A WOMAN, STARTING A RELATIONSHIP, BUILDING A FAMILY. - [scoffs] OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE PATHETIC. - YOU KNOW? WHAT ARE YOU DOING SMOKING BY THE WAY? WHAT THE HELL? WHEN DID YOU START THAT? TAKE THIS OUT OF YOUR FUCKING HAND. - [scoffs] [shooter headphones clatter and ding] I'M GONNA GO UP TO THE LODGE AND SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE IS HERE. - WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT? - YEAH. [bluesy acoustic guitar flourish] - THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD, SON, A CIRCLE. IT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME, SINCE MAN, WITH STONE AND SPEAR, WENT OUT AND KILLED HIS FIRST BEAST, MEAT AND FUR AND BONE. - BUT, DAD, WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT ANYMORE. WE HAVE STORES. - WELL, IMAGINE A WORLD WITHOUT STORES. CAN YOU? A WORLD WITHOUT COMPUTERS OR CELL PHONES OR EVEN ELECTRICITY FOR THAT MATTER. IN THAT WORLD, A MAN WILL HAVE TO FEND FOR HIMSELF SO THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY CAN SURVIVE. - COME ON, DAD, THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN. - YOU NEVER KNOW, JEREMY. YOU NEVER KNOW. I MEAN, IT WOULDN'T TAKE MUCH TO THROW THIS CRAZY WORLD OFF BALANCE, AND IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, ONLY THE STRONG, THE SMART, AND THE CAPABLE WOULD SURVIVE. - YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND LIKE ONE OF THOSE SURVIVAL NUTS. - [chuckles] AH. YOU AND YOUR HAPLESS GENERATION OF TWEETER AND FACEBOOK AND SKYPERS. I'M AFRAID IF ANYTHING WERE TO REALLY HAPPEN, YOU'D ALL END UP RUNNING AROUND LIKE A HOARD OF BLIND MICE. HEY, LOOK. - WHERE? - RIGHT THERE, HE'S LOOKING AT YOU. - I SEE HIM. [gunshot] - NEVER HESITATE, SON. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURVIVING OR NOT. [twangy acoustic guitar music] - ANDREW.

[laughs] - AN UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY HAS BEFALLEN A GROUP OF LOCAL BOY SCOUTS ON A WEEKEND CAMPING TRIP IN THE AREA OF THE NEHANTIC STATE FORES IN EAST LYME, CONNECTICUT, TODAY. SEVERAL BOYS FROM THE GROUP OF TEN SENIOR SCOUTS ON A LOCAL HIGH ADVENTURE TRIP FOR THE WEEKEND HAVE DISAPPEARED INTO THE WOODS AND HAVE YET TO BE FOUND. FOUR OTHER MEMBERS OF BOY SCOUT TROOP 26 FROM OLD LYME HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED FOR UNDISCLOSED SYMPTOMS AT LAWRENCE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN OLD SAYBROOK AFTER AN APPARENT ANIMAL ATTACK. LOCAL DOCTORS SAY THE SICKNESS APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO LYME DISEASE THAT WAS LIKELY CONTRACTED BY THE BOYS BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE TO INFECTED WILDLIFE. - SO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN YOUR WORLD? - GOT DUMPED RECENTLY. - OUCH. - HOW ABOUT YOU? BOYFRIEND? - YEAH. IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS, THOUGH.

I GUESS SO. WHAT DO YOU DO? - I WORK AT A GARAGE. - AH. - DO YOU RIDE MOTORCYCLES? - NO. BUT I LIKE GUYS WHO DO. - AH, OF COURSE. - [laughs] - DID YOU HEAR THAT?

[radio static] - A GREAT DEAL IS UNKNOWN ABOUT LYME DISEASE. IN MOST CASES, LYME DISEASE, WHEN TREATED EARLY, IS A MILD ILLNESS WITH NO LONG-TERM EFFECT. THERE NOW SEEMS TO BE A NEW STRAIN, A STRAIN OF LYME THAT IS ACTUALLY A COMBINATION OF STRAINS. HOWEVER, THIS NEW, EVOLVED STRAIN IS FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE. IT IS CAUSING VIOLENT, ANIMALISTIC BEHAVIOR-- DOG-LIKE BITING ATTACKS. THE SPREAD RATE AND DEATH TOLL IS RISING TO DISTURBING NUMBERS. SYMPTOMS CAN BE FLU-LIKE: HIGH FEVER, FATIGUE. OTHER SYMPTOMS MAY BE QUITE SEVERE: DELUSIONS, HALLUCINATIONS CAUSING SOME TO BE BEDRIDDEN IN A NON-RESPONSIVE, OPEN-EYED, COMA-LIKE STATE. THE MEDICAL RELIEF STATIONS ARE FILLING UP FAST. I REGRET TO BE THE MESSENGER FOR SUCH BAD NEWS, AND TO ALL WHO CAN HEAR MY VOICE, BE CAREFUL. - OKAY. EVERYBODY HEARD THAT. I THINK IT'S OUR BEST SHOT. GET TO ONE OF THOSE RELIEF STATIONS. - THE CLOSEST ONE'S - HOW WE GONNA GO THAT FAR WITH ALL THOSE THINGS OUT THERE? - DO THE BEST WE CAN. WE'RE PROBABLY BETTER OFF THAN MOST.

I'M TELLING YOU, PUT IT AWAY. - OKAY, PAL. - LISTEN, EVERYBODY'S PRETTY TIRED. I DON'T THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO GO WANDERING OUT IN THE DARKNESS. LOOK, WE MIGH BE ALL RIGHT FOR THE NIGHT. I SAY WE SET OU FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. [clattering from above] YOU HEAR THAT? GO UPSTAIRS AND MAKE SURE HE HAS THE BEDROOMS ALL BUTTONED UP. BE CAREFUL.

[gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot, shrieking] LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO! [gunshot] - [snarls] - [bellowing] [all grunting and snarling] - ED. - YOU'RE INFECTED, LOUIS. - I KNOW. - LOCK YOURSELF UP. CHAIN YOURSELF IF YOU HAVE TO. IT'S A VIRUS. IF YOU CAN CONTROL THE FEVER, YOU CAN MAINTAIN, BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GIVE IN TO THE MADDENING COMPULSION TO EAT HUMAN FLESH. [all moaning and growling] - ED, LET'S GO. - IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME. - [howls] - ED! ED! - COME ON, DAD! - [sobbing] ED! [all moaning and snarling] YOU MOTHERFUCKERS! [gunshot] [eerie ambient music] WE DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE MEDICAL STATION THAT NIGHT. THERE WAS TOO MANY OF THEM. WE GOT OVERWHELMED. THE INFECTED, THEY GATHERED, THEY ROSE, AND THEY ATTACKED AGAIN AND AGAIN, FURTHER SPREADING THE VIRUS, LEAVING NOTHING BUT MORE LOST SOULS, CARNAGE IN THEIR WAKE. IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER, TO MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL NOW AND HOW IT ALL HAPPENED. I LOST ANGELA AND THE BABY. [sobbing] [groaning] I THOUGHT I HAD LOS ALL HOPE FOR MYSELF ALONG WITH THEM... BUT I CAN'T QUI ON MY SON. I CAN'T QUI ON ANDREW. I DIDN'T GIVE HIM WHAT A BOY NEEDS FROM A FATHER TO BECOME A MAN AND SURVIVE IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WAN TO CALL IT. I NEED TO HOLD ON TO THIS LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE HE'S GOT A SHO AT WHATEVER'S LEF OF WHAT WE HAVE. THAT'S HIS WORLD NOW, THE WORLD WHERE THE VIRUS AND THE PLAGUE HAS BROKEN DOWN SOCIETY. BEFORE WE CAN REBUILD, WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO SURVIVE OURSELVES... A WAY TO FIGHT. WE BUILT A VEHICLE. WE CALL I THE WAR WAGON. [pulsing rock music] [engine revving] [dark rock music] EVERY DAY, WE VENTURE OU FURTHER AND FURTHER TRYING TO GE MEDICAL SUPPLIES. GET FOOD, WATER. ANYTHING WE CAN FIND THAT'S STILL OUT THERE. [suspenseful music] [clanging] [suspenseful music] THERE SEEMS TO BE NO HELP, NO GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION. IT'S ONLY WHAT WE KNOW. THIS THING HAS SPREAD ALL OVER THE WORLD, AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE, AS FAR AS THE RADIO AND TELEVISION CAN TELL. [rooster crowing] THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE, A SAFE HAVEN, A FORT OF PROTECTION. - ALL RIGHT. - THAT'S ALL WE HAVE. [wistful rock music] [speaking indistinctly] - HELLO. - EVERY DAY, WE HOPE THAT IT'S OVER, AND EACH NIGHT, OUR NIGHTMARES REMIND US THAT IT'S NOT. MAYBE SOMEDAY WE'LL FIND AN END TO ALL OF THIS. UNTIL THEN, WE KEEP FIGHTING. GOD HELP US. AMEN. - [groaning] WHO'S THERE? [grunting furiously] [yelling] [screaming] [moaning] - YOU KNOW, A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN OUT IN THE WOODS. - IT'S A VIRUS. - WILD AND ANIMALISTIC BEHAVIOR. HIGH FEVER AND FATIGUE. DOG-LIKE BITING ATTACKS. - IF YOU CAN CONTROL THE FEVER, YOU CAN MAINTAIN. - DO DEER EAT MEAT? - I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT. ANYTHING.
