I was taking his wife's pulse when I heard the news. She's pretty. Very pretty. You took the pulse of Lady Zhuangji? No way. It's true. You saw she's pregnant? They couldn't work out when she's due. So they called me in. She shouldn't be riding in a carriage. It could hurt the baby. I said I'd treat you when I recovered. Let's go for a drink. My wife's due as well. I should stay with her. After the birth, drinks are on me. Thank you. Grand Councillor Zhao Dun! General Zhao Shuo! Lady Zhuangji! What's my sister doing here? A woman of the royal family... is about to give birth to a Zhao. Once he's born... I'll be his uncle. Zhao Dun is Grand Councillor. His son is off to war... and will return a hero. How enviable! Even I'm envious! If I'd known... I'd have married her to you. Then I'd be jealous of you. Go to battle, fine. Why put your heavily pregnant wife... on show... for the whole town to see. A woman about to give birth... seeing her husband off to war... who wouldn't be moved? And she's the elder sister of the king. Isn't it really just telling the world... that the Zhaos are in charge? Brother-in-law. I've come to see you off. Zhao Shuo, I can see... Sister cares more about you than she does about me. The general is off to war, and all you do is joke around. Everyone's saying you should be in command. The king's sister, should've been married to you. You tease. They forgot my contribution long ago. When you return, we'll drink to your victory. I'll prepare the wine. The Grand Councillor will prepare the wine. Sir Tu'an. Present. When Zhao Shuo returns victorious, what will you give him? Felicitations on your imminent fatherhood. You, m'Lady... are the most fortunate of women. Who'd have thought his very first battle... would go so well? Wasn't that your hope? Why aren't they here yet? M'Lord... When General Zhao rode into town, the townspeople thronged to welcome him. They'll be some time. We've won! We've won! Grand Councillor! The Grand Councillor is Suggesting... that M'Lord hurry over there as well. I'm not going. Tell Zhao Dun... We shall wait. However late they are. We have a gift for him. M'Lord, they're here. I'll go welcome them. Good. There's an assassin! Hurry, protect the Grand Councillor! Take this. Bravo on your victory, General. So this is how you reward my son when he returns a victor? Luckily it only hit my horse's eye. This is Surely a misunderstanding. We can testify that Sir Tu'an didn't mean it. Go on, apologize to the Grand Councillor. I apologise. That was nothing... compared to leading the king astray. It was only your horse. Zhao Dun couldn't have done that. This is my punishment. The talismanic circle painted on his skin... contains cinnabar and oxblood. These insects love that smell. Is this the best method? What could be better than framing them for the crime? How can I thank you? There are 300 in the Zhao clan... you tell me. You're over forty. How'd you manage to have a boy? Don't you get it? We'd have had one earlier if we could. That it happened now... is fate. Is there some pill? I want one too. Pill? Having a boy is just fate. She was scared she wouldn't give me a boy. I said don't worry... And whoosh, out he came! I wasn't wrong, was I? The next will be a boy too. Here's your medicine. That'd be my wife. Take your time. Three things. Tell me. First, I want fish soup. Easy. The second? These names - I don't like any of them. You don't think any of them... is good enough for our son. I'll work on it. There's one more thing. Hand out 'birth eggs' to all and Sundry and people will laugh at you. Who doesn't know by now that you've had a son? I have a feeling Lady Zhuangji's due. I've never killed a woman. Even one with a Zhao child in her belly? I won't kill Lady Zhuangji. What about her child? Do we kill it? Zhao Dun, to celebrate our victory, and congratulate your son, what wine have you brought? Five Colour God of State Wine. It represents the hopes of all your people. Drink it... and let it inspire you to be a wise and virtuous ruler. It's just wine. What's it got to do with wisdom and virtue? If I don't drink it it seems I wrong the people. If I drink but I'm not wise, I wrong the people. So tell me, should I drink it, or not? I won't drink. Don't drink it then. You must drink it. I also have a gift for M'Lord. It is also to remind M'Lord to be... a wise and virtuous ruler. You're conspiring to make me unhappy. What is this gift of yours? A Divine Beast of the Western Regions. Divine Beast? It's just a dog. True. It's a dog. What's so special about it? It can tell a patriot from a traitor. M'Lord, though the palace is large... there's no room for an animal. Such a big place - of course there's room for a dog. Bring it in for us to see. Wise indeed! Don't be angry. It's just a dog. Don't be ridiculous! You don't need a sword... to deal with a dog. Take it away. Felicitations, M'Lord. Lady Zhuangji has given birth. I'm an uncle. Is it a boy or a girl? A boy. Zhao Shuo, hurry, go see them. Felicitatons, General, you're a father at last. If... your son had lived... you'd be a granddad by now. Let's drink! We want the red one. Two, she says stop giving out eggs. M'Lady, can you guess why she won't let me do this? Your wife is Surely thinking... that you're a famous doctor. A bit more reserve is called for. Hardly. She just hates giving away so many eggs! Arrest Zhao Shuo! The first tribute. No one else may drink from the king's wine. The wine's poisoned. M'Lord! What? Kill Zhao Dun! Exterminate his whole clan! Sir! Your sword. Move or I'll kill you. Go! Run! My wife asks you to give our child a name. Now, avoid drafts and stay calm. A late birth is good. It heralds nobility. Mine was born prematurely. Not a good omen. Your Surname is Cheng. Call him 'Bo'. Cheng Bo... vigorous and lofty. Thank you, M'Lady. Arrest Zhao Dun. Grand Councillor, hurry! Hurry! Hold on. Someone sawed the axle in two. M'Lady, the Grand Councillor has been murdered! And the rest of the Zhao's? M'Lady! M'Lady! There are soldiers everywhere. I nearly walked straight into them. Don't worry. There's a way out. I'll go with you. Husband! Husband! Husband! He's still breathing. What? What are you saying? Is the baby here yet? It's coming. Flee. Hurry. Escape. Husband! Husband! Cheng Ying... help deliver my baby! This lists all the Zhaos. Please check it, Sir. You know Sir Gong Sun's home? Yes. Good. Do this for me. Take the secret passage. Give the boy to Sir Gong Sun. If there's a way out, why don't you come too? We'll go together. You'll only be safe if I stay. Hurry. If something went wrong, what then? How is M'Lady? The doctor has just seen me. I'm not due for a few days. You can go now, doctor. Doctor, you forgot your medicine basket. Take the secret passage. I'll see him out. You won't get out with the child. He will if you don't stop him, Han Jue. I won't stop him, M'Lady. But he must give me the child. I'm under orders to take the child. Cheng Ying, listen to me. When this child grows up... don't tell him who his parents were... or his enemies. Forget revenge. Let him live an ordinary life. Keep following me and I'll kill him. It's not that I don't want to give him to you. But if I do, I'm dead. General... If I died now, looking pregnant, couldn't you tell Sir Tu'an... that when you came I still hadn't given birth? That he died with his mother? If Tu'an discovers... I deceived you. It's not your fault. You'll have saved the last of the Zhaos. Cheng Ying, I give my son to you. M'Lady! When I got there, she was dead. The child wasn't yet born. Idiot! Give the king and his sister state funerals. Close the city gates. No one must pass in or out. Check every home. Not one baby is to escape the dragnet. Yes, sir. How could you bring this catastrophe into our home? He hasn't eaten since he was born. Let him have some milk. Then I'll take him to Sir Gong Sun. I'll go now. Wait. What if they catch you? What if he cries? If they stop you, what'll you say? Go. Tell Sir Gong Sun to come here himself. My name is Cheng Ying, I'm a doctor. I need to see Sir Gong Sun urgently. Our master has left town. He's not home. I've something important to give him. Please tell him. I beg you, leave him be. Open up! Any newborns in the family? Open the door! Where's the boy? The boy? Soldiers came the minute you left. I didn't know who was at the door. I didn't mean to open it holding the baby. But if you put him down he cries. You let them take the Zhao boy? As if I wanted to! I had no choice. They just pounced on him. I couldn't say, no, take the other. You don't understand. They thought they were taking our son. So who's this one who's left? All the town's babies have been taken. Any one found now would be the Zhao child. He didn't take our son's place. Our son took his. Oh no! Is Cheng Ying at home? Quick, hide the boy. Is that him? Yes. You're Cheng Ying? Yes. I don't know you. Lady Zhuang Ji sent me. You attended the birth. I delivered him. Boy or girl? Boy. Where is he? I'll take him out of the city. They've closed the gates. I just returned. I have rank... and a royal pass; No one stops me. Please wait a moment. Who's that? Sir Gong Sun's here for the child. He's at the door. I'll talk to him. About what? I'll tell him the truth. What're you talking about? You think he'd believe you? That with two babies at home, you gave them the Zhao child? How could you explain that? Sir Gong Sun is close to the Zhaos. Explain it badly and he'll be furious. What are we to do? Give our boy to Sir Gong Sun? If he leaves town he'll be safe. So yes, give him to Gong Sun. And then? So long as he's safe. We'll work it out. Then I'll go with him. Okay. I've a sleeping potion. It's toxic in big doses. We have to give him some so he doesn't c I have two pills that are antidotes. Take one. Use it if necessary. It'll revive him. Don't use it unless you need to. Dress warmly. The nights are cold. And you? I won't come now. You'll be safe. I have to think of how to save the Zhao child. By the way, our boy has a name. Lady Zhuang Ji named him... Cheng Bo. She said it signifies vigour and nobility. Call him Bo'er. That's all. Go get ready. Heaven protects the Zhaos. Sir, I entrust you with the child and my wife. Thank you, sir. I'm not much for ceremony. But for saving this child, I'll make an exception. Cheng Ying. This is on behalf of the Zhaos. Anyone there? Sir, I want to go home. We'll take the boy to my place first. Master has returned. We're here. I've lied to you, Sir Gong Sun. He's my child. I gave the Zhao boy to the soldiers. Give the children water. Give the children water. If it were me... I wouldn't give up my own child either. But all the babies in town are with Tu'an Gu now. So your boy... has become the one they're looking for. I'll go tell Sir Tu'an now that he's my son. That won't save him. Tu'an won't care which is which. He'll kill them both... just to be Sure. Then I'll take him home and hide him. Hide a newborn? He just has to cry. I have medicine. He won't make a sound. You and your baby... can hide inside the compound wall. Will everyone please stand. Whoever took the Zhao child... is causing trouble for everyone. Don't worry, Your children are fine. They're being fed rice porridge. Like you I'm hoping... whoever took the Zhao child... will appear here by 3 am. If he doesn't? Does Such a person exist who, to save one child... would sacrifice one hundred others? I, Tu'an Gu, will by 3 am... find this person. Thank you, Sir! When we checked the names... we found all parents present... except those of one boy. Do you know whose child it is? The boy... belongs to a doctor called Cheng Ying. Just before you returned... he finally showed up. Doctor? And the mother? No. I must tell my husband... we haven't left town. Otherwise, at 3 am... to save the other children he'll definitely tell them... the Zhao boy was taken out of town by Sir Gong Sun. But we're still here. If you tell him we're here... Your child will be safe. But the two of you will have to witness... the slaughter of a hundred infants. Could you bear that? They'll definitely come looking. What sort of mother abandons her newborn infant? Something must be holding her up, don't you think? Perhaps it's not their child. What's the doctor's name? Cheng Ying. You hide in this wall. I'll handle them. I'll tell Tu'an Gu... I took the Zhao child outside the town. Heaven has preserved the Zhaos, But hasn't been kind to the two in hiding. You've not had it easy either. Send the servants away. It's time. The one I'm waiting for... is still not here. Which one of you is Cheng Ying? I'm Cheng Ying. Is this your child? It is. Come. He's not your child. He is my child, Sir. There's a birthmark on his forehead. Look. Say he really is yours. The other parents got here long ago. Why were you the only one missing? What kept you? This is the Zhao child, isn't it? He's not the Zhao child. He's my son, really. I believe you. But it's already 3 am. More than 100 children must die... unless I find the Zhao boy. Sir, I confess... I'm the one who took away the Zhao child. I delivered him. That's not right either. If she lived through the birth... Lady Zhuang Ji would have fled with him herself. Why would she give him to someone like you? She said only if she died looking pregnant... would I be able to escape. Who'd you give him to? I can't say. You must. Then I'll tell everyone out there... Their children's murderer... has been found. I gave the boy to Sir Gong Sun. Your children... may live. Dismount. The Zhao boy is somewhere in this house. I was curious to know who'd hide him. You should've guessed. But the Zhao child is already far away from here. I advise you to let him go. If you do... you'll release yourself as well. The Zhao boy is Surely here somewhere. When Lady Zhuangji gave him to me, she said let him grow up... never to know his parents... or his enemies. To let him live an ordinary life. Bring him here. Let me have a look. I'll let you take him far away. I told you, he's already far away from here. Well, I shan't be polite. The louder the better. Sir Tu'an, Sir Tu'an! I'll never let you take the child. Sir Tu'an. Sir Tu'an. Lady Zhuangji was right to trust you. I stayed loyal to the Zhaos. Give me the boy. Please, spare the boy. I betrayed him. Let me die in his place. Who said I'm going to kill him? Just let me have a look. I can't. Who are you? She's my wife. Why are you holding a baby who's not your own? Because his parents are dead. If you don't give him to me, you'll force me to kill him. Give him to me. Give him to me. Sir Tu'uan. Just for a moment then. Next. Cheng Ying. Take your son. Tu'an Gu, how can I make everyone fear me? Easy. Remember the name of everyone in your court. So many names - I have to remember them all? Every single one. Because any one of them could turn against you. Do you have enemies? Not any more. How can I avoid having enemies? Tomorrow you'll hold court for the first time. What should you do? Tu'an Gu. Yes. What is this virtue they call benevolence? It's one of the highest moral virtues. It means... be a good person. It's so sad. Raising the kid on his own. Hurry. Don't look. Hold on. I don't want to see you. What do these blood feuds... have to do with a commoner like you... to make you save the Zhao child. You let me get away. I knew that the child was doomed. But I regret letting you go. I thought they'd fled, or I'd never have led Tu'an to Gong Sun's home. I heard... that the woman who died with the boy... was your wife. I'll go make up your prescription. Your poor child. Just born and he loses his mother. Take your medicine and go. Give me some poison. Killing him would be too easy. I want him to live a life worse than death. You want to poison him? I'm a healer. I don't do that. Don't touch it. It'll get better by itself. But a life worse than death? Look closely - who's this boy? From now on use the back door. Ring the bell. I'll hear it. Cheng Ying. This bow... is for your son. Who was the boy who died? My son. It was fate. Fate. I will raise him well. He will avenge my son. How long do you have to wait? As long as I have to. When he's older... I'll take him to Tu'an Gu... and reveal his identity... and my own. My name is Cheng Ying. This is Cheng Bo. Sir, please accept us... into your retinue. To serve and follow... to the end of time. Tell me... how you helped me? I helped you kill one child... and save a hundred others. When you put it like that it seems I owe you. You do. You saved your own boy too. Come. Come. What do you say? Say 'godfather'. C'mon. I'm going to kill you. I've done it. FATHER, SON That's right. Bo'er, Godfather's got two gifts for you: Armour and a sword. Cheng Ying, help him with the armour. Without these two things, you'll never be a man. He doesn't have them. Your having them is good enough for me. Go up on the roof and find it. Thank you, godfather. Remember - your sword is your best friend. I know. Jump down. No, don't. Bo'er, don't jump. Do you hear me? Jump. I'll catch you. Bo'er. I'll get you! I'll get you! Bo'er, listen. Remember this advice: Don't trust anyone. Bo'er, let's go home. My sword. Bo'er, jump. Dad will catch you. I didn't go to school either. I'll teach you to read and write. You were poor then. Now you have money. Why won't you let me go to school? I know. You want to keep an eye on me. Not true. Pour some for your godfather. If you drink wine with the medicine, you'll never get better. If you give up drinking, you won't need the medicine. You'll be well again. Enough. My drinking is none of your business. Your job is the medicine. I've tested it. Take it an hour after drinking. Heat it up first. Medicine a patient likes to take - only you could do that. He has medicine that can save anyone's life! Rubbish. It's true. And Godfather, he won't let me go to school. We'll fine him a big cup of wine. I can't - one sip and I'm drunk. He's lying. He can drink! And he never gets drunk. Alright, I'll drink then. What'd you whisper in his ear? You'll find out tomorrow. There he is! You've been drinking? Yes. Now that you're in his retinue, you've got good food, good wine. It's quite not a bad life. I hear you even cured his illness. Is that true? It is. If he's taking your medicine, couldn't you have poisoned it? Wouldn't that be a good revenge? I told you before. When the boy's old enough, I'll take him to Tu'an... and tell him who we really are. I want them to be as close as kin. Then the Zhao child... will kill him with one thrust of his sword. Now that's revenge. You're dreaming. How old is old enough? When he's capable of killing him. What if something happens before then? Are you Sure that when he grows up... he'll be able to do it? You want them to grow close. It's not fair to the boy. It's very fair. And me? Eight years. Is it fair to me? Let me see the boy. Aren't you afraid your scar will scare him? And he'll tell Tu'an about you? Aren't you afraid he'll tell Tu'an... ...that when a stranger visits... you lock him up in a dark room? We've a pact. The day after I see you I take him for a good meal. That's fine for now. When he's a bit older... a bowl of noodles won't buy obedience. Why does that man always make you unhappy? I'll tell Godfather. He'll arrest him! Where's Cheng Bo? What is it sir? He's here. Bo'er. I'm here. Godfather. Bo'er, What you told me last night - tell your dad. I can't. He'll hit me. I won't hit you. Tell me. I told godfather... I want just one day without you watching me. Is that all? No need to call in the troops. Do you hear what he's saying, Cheng Ying? You've raised him these eight years. It's not been easy. Have a rest today. Godfather will take you to school. Great! I'll go too. Do my soldiers have to tie you up? At least let me find him a change of clothes. Forget the noodles. What if I let you go to school? How would that be? I'd keep my mouth shut. Promise? Promise. Good. I didn't see Sir Tu'an bring any boy here. Go and see for yourself. Why was the school built here? It's in honour of Lady Zhuangji's child. Whose idea was that? Sir Tu'an. M'Lady - There are soldiers everywhere! Tu'an hasn't been here. Neither has your son. Bo'er Cheng Ying... help me deliver my child! If dad looks for me at the school - what then? He'll be like an ant in a hot wok. Bo'er! Bo'er! I want to come again tomorrow. Easy. Come early. I'll be waiting. Godfather, do you have enemies? Enemies? The year you were born... I killed them all. You know why your dad keeps you in his sight? It was also that year... he almost lost you. Does my dad have enemies? Everyone does. Godfather, is it possible not to have enemies? If everyone could do this... not see their enemies as Such... no one would have enemies at all. But it's not easy. I know I can't do it. Come. I'll teach you... how to exterminate your enemies. You haven't told me what you learned at school today? What it would take for a world without enmity. If you don't treat another as your enemy, he won't be your enemy. Liar! You never went to school! All you learned was how to lie to your dad. Tell me... did you spend the whole day with your godfather? Yes. What'd you tell him? I told you I wouldn't tell him anything. Liar. How'd the Subject of enemies come up? You drive me crazy. You won't slip out of my sight again, and forget about school. You want one day without me watching over you? Have one. He won't tell me. He's hard to control now that he's older. He lied to me just now. If he can lie to you, maybe he's already gone behind your back and told Tu'an about us. We have to think of a way... to find out for Sure if he's done so or not. And to enSure he doesn't in the future. He's not easy to scare. Play for real and we'll know for Sure. He won't dare say anything after that. This is my son, Cheng Bo. I know you. You're my godfather's enemy. Rubbish. You've told him, haven't you? I'll tell him tomorrow. If you dare... Dad. I'll kill you first. Touch him again and you'll have to fight me. Bo'er, run! Say anything and I'll kill your dad, then you. Bo'er, run! How could you let him escape? This ruins everything! This is how you've taught him? You bit him? Dad. Let me go to school. Forget it. Then I'll tell about you and Scarface. You won't leave this house. Come back. Halt! Halt! Halt! Godfather, godfather! I've got something to tell you. I'm taking you to school right now. I want Godfather to take me. Let me go! Cheng Ying. Godfather, save me! Let me go! Let me go! You're out of line! Let him go. Let me go! Did you hear me? Hold it. Which one of us do you want to kill? Why is my taking Bo'er to school Such a problem? Is the Subject of Bo'er's education worth drawing swords over? This isn't just grief. There's something else going on. Tell me. What's wrong with you... that you can't let him out of your sight? Do you know, Bo'er? I'll tell you. He's never known his mother. No. It's not that. I can see... that you hate me. True. Bo'er, your godfather's soldiers murdered your mother! Didn't you promise not to tell him that? You asked. I had to tell the truth. Bo'er, your dad hates me. But you're not allowed to. I don't want to be his godson any more. If you don't learn martial arts from him, you'll never beat him. Dad, please don't follow me anymore. Your and Uncle Scarface's secret is safe with me. Not so loud. Eat up. Then you can go to school. You can go without me. I don't need to take you. You can't go. I didn't raise you for 15 years so you could go to war. Dad... You said you'd stop watching over me. Once I'm a hero, you'd be known as Cheng Bo's dad. No one would dare touch you. How do you know you'll be the victor? Because Godfather trained me in martial arts. You think only of him. It makes me so angry. You're upset again. He's going. What if he gets killed? All this - for nothing. Cheng Ying, don't be selfish. Don't let your own feelings... prevent him from becoming a warrior. That's what he needs. Go somewhere, let me talk to Bo'er. Dad, where'd you go? Our old home. Put on your armour. You're his dad. You speak first. What'll I say? That I'm not his dad? That Zhao Shuo was his dad and Zhuang Ji his ma? Wouldn't that give him a fright? Alright, I'll speak first. I'll begin with this scar. Forget it. He's never liked you. He won't believe it. Then I'll leave. You talk to him. You can't go. Without you, he'd be dead. He needs to know you saved his life. To your wife. To Lady Zhuang Ji. To your son. To Sir Gong Sun. Godfather. Impressive? Go back... and come out again. Impressed? You remind me of someone. Not my dad? Yes, your dad. No, I have to go cheer him up. Go. I'll start with the story of the medicine basket. All that's easy enough. But if Bo'er asks you... who was the boy who died in his place... what'll you say? That he was my son. And he'd believe it? That you were capable of that? You have to convince him. Tell him... that the boy who died... was a foundling. Stolen. Then my son died for nothing. It was my son who died for him. He has to be Zhao Shuo's son. Fifteen years ago... when we knocked down the wall... and found that woman and child... it was clear she was his mother. So you mean that... the boy you killed was Cheng Ying's son? That to save the Zhao child... he'd sacrifice his own wife and child? Is that possible? Why not? In the heat of the moment, anything's possible. Dad has something to tell you. You'll see then why I... don't want you going to war. I'm listening. Your Surname is Zhao, not Cheng. Your father was the hero Zhao Shuo. Your mother was the king's sister Lady Zhuangji. The day you were born... Your enemy exterminated 300 members of your family. Who was this enemy? Tu'an Gu. He killed your entire family... and would have killed you too. Because you were the last of the Zhaos. To rescue you... Cheng Ying let another boy take your place... and saved your life. He is your true saviour. Who was the boy? One fated to die, a foundling. Not true. It was his own son. Nonsense. He allowed his son to die in your place. I knew you were Godfather's enemy. But he's not my enemy. Don't think I'm going to kill him for you. I won't kill my Godfather. Dad... make up whatever story you like. I'm going to war. Bo'er. Take this medicine. It could save your life. It's the last one. Keep it. I'm going to win my battles. Bo'er. What? If you're not winning, run. Well that's 15 years wasted. You're right. Who'd believe that story? There's always me. Prepare some poison. Arm yourselves. The cavalry is assembled. Godfather's been thinking. I'm worried. I'm going with you. You don't give me any credit. Kill! Follow me. Don't let him escape! Grab him. Halt! Halt! Godfather! Help me! Godfather! Godfather, we've won! I congratulate you. Let's go. Bo'er was victorious. Dad, where's that medicine? Godfather's wounded. So you won. The medicine! Bo'er, I'm taking you away.. To live an ordinary life. The medicine! Godfather's dying! Put that down. Give it to me. Let go. Give it to me. Let go. You want to save him. You... Let go! It's time for all this to end. Refuse me this... and I'll die with him. Dissolve it in warm water. Alright. Godfather, hold on. I've got the medicine. I've found him! Bo'er. Bo'er! Godfather, you're shouting. I can hear from your voice... You're better. It happened as soon as I took that pill. While resting these few days... I thought everything through. As for you... I Suspect you're not really your dad's son. Then who am I? The child of Zhao. I believe he let his own son die in your place. Call your dad here. I want to thank him properly. Han Jue said your son died in my place. Can you prove you had a son? Easily. This was his room. So who am I, really? I told you - the orphan of Zhao. My own son was killed by Tu'an Gu. Why'd you let me have the medicine? You're a loser. You always have been. Don't talk to your dad like that! You're not my dad. How can you say that? You're my son. My name is Cheng Ying. This is Cheng Bo. Sir, please accept us... into your retinue. To serve and follow... to the end of time. Dad, tell him who I am! I advise you not to fight. It's no use. You can go as far away as you like. But first, I need to ask... who'd you get to shoot this poison arrow? Han Jue. For 15 years... we've been plotting your murder. He helped me smuggle the boy out to safety. So, I was right to slash him. But why'd he do that? We were both there when Lady Zhuangji died. She begged us to save her child. Oh. It was an act of conscience. If it were me... maybe I'd do the same. Han Jue never had the chance to kill me. But you could easily... have slipped poison in my medicine. Why wait fifteen years? I made a vow... to raise the child first. I'll take him to Tu'an Gu... and reveal his identity... and my own. I see why you saved me now. You didn't want me to die. You wanted to make me a laughingstock. To live a life worse than death. No. I saved you because Bo'er wanted to repay you. Cheng Ying, when I killed that child... you and your wife could've told me... he was yours. What did Gong Sun do to perSuade you... to sacrifice your own child for him? His death... convinced you that he... was the Zhao child. I had my doubts. Only when you gave him to me did I believe... he was the Zhao child. You tricked me. No, you tricked me. A man who would betray his own child... scares me. Our boy was not going to Survive anyway. We couldn't drag another into the mess. If he knew... how many lives he saved... he wouldn't blame us. Cheng Ying... What right did you have to decide if your son should live or die? What right too... to have the Zhao boy avenge you? Could he kill me? And would he? From the day you brought him here, you were defeated. That's all. You may go. There's one thing left. He hasn't avenged his son yet. Take up your sword. Pick it up. I've let you off twice now. Careful. Bo'er, we can't defeat him. The sword and armour that I gave you... give it back. I don't want anything of yours... except your life. I must avenge my father. Fine. It's me you should kill. You think I won't? It's just not your turn yet. You don't yet know the meaning of a life worse than death. Move! Let me look at you. Bo'er, let this be the end of it.
