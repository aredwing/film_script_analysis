Add, I must give little attention to my guests. - Not I a guest? - Charming, Sr. Humphrey. - You stay for supper, Won't you? - You bet I will. - You're mine for the rest of the night. - Sounds most improper! Please Sydney, Can't I have a moment alone with you? Lets get out when nobody is watching. Not now. Aunt Hester has an eye on us. Perhaps later. Margaret, I think Sydney should dance with some other young men, Let Kit Humphrey not monopolise. Naturally, Hester. They are in love. Well , she's your daughter, not mine. - Mother, why aren't you with Gray now? - No darling, we got to watch. Come on join the merry here. Isn't youth glorious, Gray? I prefer a little maturity. I feel young with you. You, my dear you're a child still. Its wonderful to be free, to have a burden lifted from one's shoulder. - You did that. - With a little piece of paper. I don't mean by helping me to get my divorce, by your strength and courage. - Its a new life. - For me too Margeret. Life only starts when love comes. Why should it had come to us so late? - It isn't late. - Oh, Gray! We've time for everything, still? Time for everything. Carol singers, they've come! You go at the side door. I go the other way, hit you at the pond. Kit... And another thing, Kit, I'm counting on youo - to break up this party early. - Me? Sydney had no sense of time. Miss. Fairfield, shall I give the singers the supper now? Not yet, Bassett. I'll be back directly. - Where were you? - I got tired waiting in the cold, come. - Come in. - Sorry. Aunt Hester way laid me. - We really have to go back o the party. - Darling we can't wish each other Merry Christmas in public? Oh! Merry Christmas forever! - You're coming to Canad with me, you know. - When? - Anyday you know. - Not possibly before Mother and Gray are married. They are being married New Years Day, aren't they? Look, my mothers engagement ring. - Kit. - You'll the bride of 5th generation to wear it. - Darling. - I have made that your finger will let me. Mrs. Fairfield, we like to sing something special in honor of you and Mr. Meredith. Thanks! What would you like to sing? God bless the master of this house, God bless the Mistress too. Thats very sweet of you! Margaret! How can you let them sing that? Hilary is the master of this house and no one else! - Your husband, Hilary. - Hester, please. - Do you know the next line? - "And all the little children..." "...around the table go." How many go round the table? Well, Canad is a wide open space there's all the room for children. Say, twenty. All right, stop at about ten. All right, all at one batch. I hope not! They say two of each kind and a slight pause... No,no pauses. Unless one hit on someone known as as Prime Minister. How soon can you telegram Minister? Almost instantaneous, they say. Dear fool! She's late for that, Mrs. Gray. I hadn't the haute to waken her. Because at odd hours talking to Kit. - But just now was when he was home. - He's leaving so soon for Canad. I must say Margaret, you are neglecting your duty as a mother. Merry Christmas! Everyone, I'm not late am I? Good morning, Aunty. Thanks darling for the scandalous dress you put in my room. I'll wear it at night and dance with Kit. See what father Christmas sent Sydney. And then it's dried you Sydney for the card case. Its a cigarette case only, dear. I thought you send me another prayer book, we might do a deal. I thought so. Thanks very much. Sweet of you. Shall we? - What? - Swap? - Sydney darling, thats rather rude. - Why I have been hinted at. Its against my principles to kneel down and say I'm miserable sinner. I'm not miserable, and I'm not a sinner! Thats the way you let your daughter speak to me? - Sydney, dear. - I'm not better even if you admire that's the way ...she views us. - Thats not true, darling. hasn't she led your lives since you divorced father? Hasn't she prevented you from marrying Gray for years? As long as my poor brother Henry is alive, inspite of God Margaret is still his wife. You know, father is same as dead to us. I always think it that way. - He was in asylum before I was born. - I've never even seen him. Shame to you! He doesn't deserve even if he was in right mind. When I used to go and see him, he didn't even know me. I know fathers condition is sad, but it can't be helped. The war wasn't our fault can't blame anyone for shellshock. - Shellshock? - Hester! His away we have got. Let us not go with a handkerchief to our eyes all the time. We got to live. - You're as hard as ingot. - No. I hate hypocracy. I'm at the wrong side of the family. I'm the one person in this house who remembers poor Hilary! I shall ask you to excuse me. Darling. You mustn't say such things to your Aunt Hester. You get so excited, you remind me... ..your father was so excited. - Why no really. I needn't that though if I want to. I just want to run my life. Mother, I want to tell you something. Kit wants me to marry him right away and go to Canad with him. Darling, you're so young to think of getting married! - You were married at my age. - I know. I was too young. I thought I was in love, I know now it was just the war. Whenever your generation wants an excuse for anything, they blame it on the war. Could you get married if you didn't want to. There was a feeling in the air. One did mad things. Hilary was going out to the trenches, to get hurt. He was so fond of me that frightened me. I was so sorry that I thought I cared. I know now what I felt for him wasn't really love. - Can't you understand? - No. Either you care or you don't. - I love Kit! - Do you darling? Well if you're so sure of yourself I shall have to let you go. - I do so want you to be happy. - I shall be! - With Kit and millions of children. - Precious! I must hurry and dress, Gray will be here soon. Darling, wont you try and find Aunt Hester and make it up with her? After all, - Christmas union. - I'm all right mother. Aunty, I'm sorry I was hurrying. Will you forgive me? Its all right, there. I couldn't help thinking of Hilary this day of all days, no one to greet him or wish him Happy Christmas. Before you were born, he used to spend hours in this room with his music. He had great talent as a composer. Might have made something out of it, if he hadn't gone that day. I always loved that sonata of his. Its too bad he never finished it. - Merry Christmas, Bassett. - Merry Christmas to you Sir. Merry Christmas, darling. - Gray, what have you got there? - No. Open this one first. No, you do it. I'm too excited. I'm sure its divine. Silver fox fur! Gray, you shouldn't have been so extravagant. Put them on. I love being spoilt. Hadn't had much of it, had you Meg. - Don't call me Meg. - Why not? I want you to call me something no one else has ever used. Well you're getting one new name pretty soon any how. New year, new name, new life. Listen. - Don't you love it? - Church bell? Wedding bells. Do you think I'm sentimental. You're pure 19th century. - There goes the twentieth. - I'll answer mother. Hello? You rang me up? Sorry he's in trouble. Theres surely someone trying to get us. - Come along. Church bells have stopped. - They stopped when the bell rang. Why mother, whats the matter? - Run darling, you're late. - Come along my dear. Its too good to be true. - What Margaret? - Everything. What a fool I am! - Goodbye, Darling. - Goodnight, mother. - Bye, Sydney. - Goodbye. - Sydney, the telephone. - All right, aunty. Someones being trying to get us all morning. Hello? Yes? No, Mrs. Fairfield is out. Would you leave a message? This is Miss Fairfield speaking. Its about pap. Yes? What? This morning? No, we know nothing. No, he's not here. I see. Ofcourse we'll let you know. You let us know at once Yes thanks. Fathers gone away. - Who spoke to you? - The head of the asylum. Fathers been very much better lately. - In the last week he showed marked improvement I always had faith he'll get well ? - Quite possible. - After all these years? It took even longer with your Aunt Grace. What aunt Grace? Why do you mention her? I don't know. I was thinking. In connection with pap. Was she ever in an asylum? No. She was very ill for a long time. Aunty, you're not telling me the truth. Wasn't it only shell shock with father? He's well again. They told you. He's well again. Aunty, you're trying to hide something. What is shell shock? It was foregone by shellshock. So... in all family there's insanity. You shouldn't say that! There are troubles in every family, but one doesn't talk about them. Suppose father really is well what will he do? - Its a question of what your mother will do. - Pretty well concerns mother. - Won't it? - What are you driving at? I can't discuss it with you. Aunty! - What are you looking for? - Someone has moved them... Meg! Meg, my darling! I'm not Meg. Ofcourse. I beg your pardon. I thought you were another girl. I've been away for a long time. Where have you come from? That place. That place. I took a car... - Who are you? - I think I'm your daughter. Daughter! Daughter! Thats good! My wife's not my wife, - she is my daughter. - You're forgetting its been years and years. Ofcourse. It is years. Its a lifetime! My daughters lifetime. Whats your name, daughter? - Sydney. - Sydney. Sydney, eh? My mother was Sydney. I like Sydney. I... I suppose we are a bit of a shock to each other, Sydney. No, you're not a shock to me. - But I'm afraid... - Is my...? Is your...? Where is Margaret? - At church. - She'll be back soon, eh? - Yes. Thats why I'm afraid... - I think - I go and meet her. - Oh I wouldn't. Come and sit down. Wait for her. Very well. - Sit down. - Thanks. Isn't this odd? Makes me want to cry. Why? My dear child thats all over. Laugh. Laugh. Thats the thing to do. What a lovely room this is! I can't say I like these funny things. Do you? No, I like leathers ones better too. Those aren't the only changes. Everything changes. I bet your aunt Hester hasn't. I bet you... I say... Is your mother such a darling still? - Look here father, you know... - Father. We got to get things straight before she comes back. Yes be back soon, eh? Why has Meg moved the clock? Much better where we had it before. We will have that put back. Its 1 o'clock, she's late. I really think I'll go and meet your mother. - No. You're to stay here. - Very well. - I'll do as I like about that. - I'll not let you right now! - I'll frighten her? - You will realise what a shock would do to her. I never knew anyone will die of joy. Father you don't understand. - You and mother are... - This is nothing to do with you. - But you mustn't! - I tell you I won't be hecked ! I can't stand it! I've had enough of it! - I had enough of it! - Don't you talk to mother like that! Meg understands! So do I understand. I believe you do. You got wild. All in a moment. Thats my way too. I means nothing Meg can't see with it means nothing. But it makes a man wild you know to be browbeat when he is sane... I am sane! Thats all over, isn't it? -I am sane, daughter. - Father. Don't let me get the way I was just now. Its bad. Help me go slow I am as well as you are, you know... but its new. It happened today. Like a curtain lifting. - I was standing in the garden... - I can't just see how you got away. I was led like Peter out of prison. I went through the gates, open. Their eyes were blinded. It was sheer luck. There were some visitors leaving, and I left along with them, talking. Nobody ever spotted me, heap service, of them I mean I tried. But you had no money! I took the first taxi I saw and promised him double. He's at the lower gate now waiting to be paid. - Father! - Your mother will see to it. - Thats him. I expect he got tired waiting. - No. That will be mother. - You stay here. You must let me... - Daughter! Is that your mother? Give me a minute. Give me a minute! Whose taxi? - Hilary! - Meg! Eres Meg? Is it Meg. Meg I've come home - Sydney! - Its all right mother. Meg, I'm well. I'm well, Meg! It came over me like a lantern fly, like a face turning to you. I was in the garden, lost. I'll never make anyone understand. I was never really like the rest of them. I was always really sane. But face was turned away. - What face? - The face of God. - Sydney, is he...? - Its all right mother. He's come to himself. So... - What am I to do? - Whats that? I... I... You don't say a word. Aren't you glad to see me. Ofcourse. I'm glad... Your poor Hilary! If you only knew what it was like to say to myself: "I'm home!" That place... Forbid that was a bit comfort. It was hell. - Hell. - They were good to you? - Good enough. - They didn't... - ill treat you? - Mother you know you did the very best. I fit had been heaven, Wwhat difference does it make? I was a dead man. Do you know what the dead do in heaven? They sit on their golden chairs sicken for home. - Why did you never come? - They wouldn't let me. - It made you worse. - Because I wanted you so much. - You didn't know me. - My voice didn't. And my speech and my action didn't. But I knew you, Meg. Behind the curtain, and the dreams, and the noises and the abandonment of God. I wanted you. I wanted... We mustn't talk about these things. It isn't safe. I tell you, when I talk, I see a black hand reaching up through the floor. You see? That wide new crack in the floor? They catch me by the ankle and drag... - Drag... - Sydney! Father! Father, go slow. Its all right mother. We'll manage. You tell your mother, its all right. You understand that? Once it was a real hand. Now I know its in my mind. I tell you, Meg. I'm well! But it isn't safe to think about anything... My dear! The Holly, and the crackle of the fire and home like a veil of peace on me and you, my dear one, - standing there so still. - No, no, no! Yes, yes, yes! Luncheon is served, ma'am. Set another place, Bassett. This... My... - This gentleman is staying to lunch. - Yes, miss. Staying to lunch? Thats a good joke! I say you miss I'm laughing! Its blessed to laugh. Staying to lunch? Yes my girl. Lunch and tea and supper and breakfast. Thank heaven! For many a long days! Hi. Yes, Dr. Alliot, they are still at lunch. - How quick can you get here? - I will come at once. Is he excitable or fairly calm? - I see. - You are not partly silent? Please hurry, won't you. Mothers such a terrible nervous strain. - Thank you, Dr. Alliot. - Something wrong with your mother? No, Gray. Will you wait in the drawing room? I'll send mother here to you. Are you not extraordinary? Its practically amazing! She knew I was her father the moment she saw me. - There you are, Sydney. - Yes, father. You know? I'm dying to see the little music room. Will you excuse me? Hester, the pianos never been at the right place. - No, Hilary? - Sure then, all the tones lost. Well, whats the mystery? Gray, he's come back! - Who? - Hilary. Hilary? - Hilary! - He got away. He came straight here. Don't be frightened. Is he dangerous? No. Poor fellow! - Darling, I take charges. - No, Gray. You don't understand. He's well. He knows me. - I can't believe it! - You think I want to believe it? What a ghastly thing to say? Dr. Alliot is coming. He's always been able to manage him. I and you away quietly poor devil. No, Gray. He's well. The old Hilary. Voice and ways. His hair is gray, but he talks he did in 20s. Its horrible. And ofcourse, he knows nothing. - About what? - The divorce. You and me. He thinks everything is as he left it. - You've said nothing? - Not yet. He's like a lost child come home. - I couldn't. - You come away with me at once! I can't! Oh, Gray! I'm wicked! I was wishing he never got well. In my heart, I'm hating my husband! You have no husband! You're marrying me. You're mine. I know. I'm not afraid of you. He's got to be told. - Darling, let me tell him. - No. That would be cruel. I must tell him myself. It will hurt him less coming from me. Don't you know it does to me? To live in the same house with him! I can't stay here. Don't let me stay here. Come with me, the car is outside Meg! There he is. Meg? Listen to me. We're leaving for London tonight. Going to be married at once. Meg! There's no train till nine. So I'll be back here at 20:30. - You be ready? - If I manage to... Oh, Meg, Sydney said you got... Hello. Who is this? Oh doctor, eh? I've been expecting him down only. Its no good you know, Sr. I'm as fit as you are. - Any test you like. - Mr. Meredith called to see me, Hilary. He's just going. Sorry. - Goodbye, hate leaving you. - You must. Its better. Come back! - Who's that man? - His name is Gray Meredith. Whats he doing here? He's an old friend. - I don't know him, do I? - No. Since you were ill in the last 5 years. He's in love with you. You shouldn't let him, Meg. You're such a child. You don't know what you're doing when you look and smile. I do know. I don't wonder at him, or brood. Meg, you've changed. - Yes, Hilary. - Tall, more beautiful. Yet there's something I miss. Yes, Hilary. Something you used to have. A kind way with you. The childs got it, Sydney. She's more you than you are. You've grown right out. Away, beyond me. Haven't you? - Yes, Hilary. - But I'm going to catch you up. You help me catch up with you, won't you Meg? Just wait for me. Hold out your hands to me. I can't, Hilary. My hands are full. You mean Sydney? She'll be off in no time. She told me all about the boy. Whats his name? Kit. Its not Sydney. What do you mean? What're you trying to tell me? Meg... Meg, whats changed you? Why do you look at me sideways? Why do you flinch when I talk loudly? And when I kissed you... Its that man. - Margaret! - I've done nothing wrong! I've been trying to tell you. Hilary, 15 years is along time. Yes, I suppose it is a long time. For a woman to be faithful. What do you expect me to do? Forgive you! Theres nothing to forgive! Oh, Hilary, we've so much to forgive each other! But not that. To divorce you then? Because I'll not do that. Hilary, I devorced you. What? I divorced you. You couldn't do such a thing! You have no cause! I see what you're trying to do. You're trying to confuse me! Thats like driving me mad again! Why you said! Sydney! Where's that girl? Sydney! Hester! Come here all of you! What is it? What have you done? Frightening mum! No! Not on her side! You're my little Sydney. Kind. My Sydney. What is that you said? Go slowly. Sydney, humour him. What was I calling you for? Ah, Yes! A riddle, I got a riddle for you. When's a wife not a wife? - Do you want to know the answer! When she is Miss. - Clm, Hilary. - What have you done to him, Margaret? - I told him the truth. If life holds you what she said to me, you think I was mad. And thats what you want you to think! She wants to.... get rid of me. I'm in the way? She comes to me and said! What do you think? She's not my wife. What do you think of that. Its my fault. I began at the wrong end. Hilary, I'm not what you think. - What is that man doing inmy house? - I'm free. - I got my divorce. - If he comes here, I'll kill him! - Sydney! - Its all right mother. We'll manage somehow. - Dr. Alliot in the home, ma'am. - Ask him to come in here at once. Yes, ma'am. Hello, Margaret, my dear. How lovely you're looking. Miss. Fairfield, how do you do? Sydney. Hilary, my dear boy welcome back! - Its at Marriot, Is'nt it? - Your memory's all right. - I suppose I sent for you. - No, rather unconventionally. - I had been in touch with... - That place? Yes. You may have to go back. Formalities. - An official clearance. - I don't mind. I'm well. I'm well, Alliot. I'm not afraid of what you say. No, well that sounds hopeful. But I can't go doctor. - Only for a few hours. Its my wife. I lost my temper. I do lose my temper. It means nothing! Go slow, eh? She says she's not my wife. I see. Thats the trouble. I married Meg. I fell ill. Now I'm well again. I want my wife. - Yes, yes. - "Yes, yes." It sounds familiar. I suppose what you call humouring a lunatic. I hope to be convinced that the troubles over, but will you let me put the case to you? You can have 50 cases. Makes no difference. I've listened, father. - You're not against me, Sydney? - Nobody's against you. - We only want you to listen. - I've done nothing. I'm not a drunkard. I'm not a convict I've done nothing. I've been to the war, the fight for her. For all of you. For my country. What have I get from it? Not honourable scars, not medals and glory. But years in hell. Then when I get out again, then the country I fought for, the woman I fought for, say to me: "You've done without us for so long, you can do without us all together". Thats what it amounts to. When I was helpless, they took all I had from me. Did I ever hurt you? Didn't I love you? Could I help being ill? - What have I done? - My poor father, you died. We cry after the dead, I always wondered what the welcome back will be. - Well you know now. - I don't say it is hard. Thanks, thats sympathy indeed! My wife is full of it, isn't she. Poor dear! I was married to you once? I've quite forgotten. Face it man! One of you must suffer. Which is it to be? The whole or the main? The healthy woman with her life before her or the man whose children are never to have been born? I say thats going to far. In this matter Fairfeild, I cannot go too far. Come we have a little chat together? Just you and I alone. Quietly. Very well. I'll listen to what you have to say. You'll be here, Margaret? Yes, Hilary. Its providence that he's come back in time! Hester, please. I can't see that you should go on with your marriage with your husband here. - I have no husband. - The divorce decree can be anulled. Hester, Knowing his history, knowing mine it isn't possible that you expect me to go back to him - He has come back to you! - You don't know what it means to want so desperately to feel. And to feel nothing, to dread the person who loves you, to shrink from the look in his eyes. Do you want him on your concience all your life? Sydney! My poor little Sydney! I'm all right, mother. Hilary is coming with me to the asylum just for formal clearance. He wants a word with you first. - Can you manage it? - Yes. - Where's Meredith? - He's coming to take me away. Good. Sooner the better. - You be gentle with Hilary. - Ofcourse. Yes I'm sure you can. God be with you, Margaret. Goodbye my child. I'll send him in. - Dr. Alliot! - Yes my dear? What you said to father, you meant I should never've been born? I'm afraid I said too much. Don't take it too seriously. Then I'll ask you something. He means everything to me. Thats my whole life. Dear, how serious we are! Terribly serious. There is insanity in our family, in fathers family. Isn't there? - Well, I... - Please uncle, I got to know! - One or two members. - Aunt Grace? Grace Fairfield was for a time. Its in our blood, isn't it? With father, it wasn't just shell shock. It was latent insanity, brought on by shellshock. Technically. Even if I'm fit, perfectly fit, if I had children, it might come out in him? There will be a risk. I see. Thanks. Sydney! I never met a finer, more splendid, better balanced girl than you are. - Thank you, Dr. - You must forget all these things. Just be happy. Your fathrer's waiting for me. Hilary. She received. You'll be gentle with her. Ofcourse. Thanks, doctor. Its al right. I'm going. I've got to, I see that. He's made me see. After he's made it all right with that place, I'm going to stay with him till I can look around. I'm glad you got a good friend. Yes, he's a good chap. He made me see. He said it and I do see, but its too late, ofcourse. Isn't it? Yes, its too late. Yet, it wouldn't be fair to ask you, - would it? - Oh, Hilary! - Hilary. - No woman can be expected. You couldn't be expected too, Could you? Its what he says. You made a new life for yourself. Haven't you? There's no room in it for me. Isn't it? So its just a case of saying goodbye I'm going because I quite see, that there's no chance Meg! Meg! Isn;t there just a chance? - Hilary, I can't stand this! - Listen to me, Meg! I've been alone, so long... - Hilary! - I won't trouble you. I won't get in your way, but... don't drive me out alone. Like I came. Give me something, The rustle of your dress, the cushion where you laid. Your voice about the house. You cannot deny me such little things things you give your servant. I'll be your dog. Like would I beat you, Hilary! You promise! For better or for worse. In sickness and health. You can't go back on your promise. - Isn't fair. - Anythings fair. Meg, you don't know - What misery means! - I'm learning. You don't know, or you couldn't leave me to it. I've never known you beat a creature in your life. I've seen you step aside for a little creeping green thing on the path. You never hurt anything. How can you hurt me like this? You can't have changed that much! Its how you took me before. Now you're doing again. Have I? Oh, Meg! Meg, you can't leave me. You can't drive me out alone like this. You can't. You can't! I suppose I can. Will you wait for me? You be here when I get back? I know you will. Oh, Meg! God bless you, Meg! God bless you, Meg! You mean, God help me. Well wait, doctor. I'm coming. God bless you, Meg. Bassett, Mr. Humphrey is at the lower gate. Will you ask him to come in the music room, please. - Yes, Miss. - Thank you. - Anything wrong, dear? - Yes, I've been palled. What on earths the matter? - Got dumps? - Don't be silly. I'm sorry, I'm not a mind dear darling. - If I were, I'll cheer you up. - Have you said I'll be cheered! I know you're playing a jike on me? Come along now, smile! Don't be such a fool! What is it, Sydney? Have I mistaken about this evening, you expect me earlier? Good heavens no! Now that I have been so busy, I haven't given you a thought. Would you tell me what all this is about? - After all, we were last night here... - Last night was what? I've a vivid recollection, we decided to get married Oh, yes? Yes, I believe. You conjured up pictures of a rugged existence in Canad, with a herd of scoring children. Was it two boys, two girls and a prime minister? Sydney. Darling. I simply don't know you. Thats just the trouble. Nunca me has conocido y nunca me conocers. You never have, you never will! I'm never going to marry anyone! haven't the joke gone on far enough? I'm bored, terribly bored. Can't you understand that Something very extraordinary must have happened since last night? That you talk like this! Why don't you go! How do you stop taking me and leave me alone. I'm going to stay here you tell me the truth. Can't you see, i'm trying to let you down easily? Can't you accept that and go? But you're doing it in the cruelest sort of way, Sydney. I can stand it whatever it may be. Kit, I'm only trying to save you unhappiness. But there isn't a thing I wouldn't face for you and with you. Very well. Father came home this morning. Your father? - You mean he came from the... - From the asylum, yes. He wasn't suffering just from shell-shock. Its in his blood. - Sydney! - Yes, its in my blood too. - But you're imagining it. - I know it! You mustn't believe that! No! You see? You can't even stand the first glimpse of the truth. Darling, it would be dangerous for me to marry. - But I'm not afraid! - You no more right than I. Our children, it might come out in them. We needn't bear any children. - We have each other, our love. - We've someday to hate me You love children. I hate myself for cheating. Besides, you will like to be with you without more children, all alone? - Your children, Kit? - Dear we would be together. No, Kit! Don't! And that isn't all. I'm very like my father, I might even become... Is well that it inflict there on you. - But if I'm willing - You shan't be. I won't let you. You must go away. You can't do this to me! For years I've loved you with everything in it. You're part of me I can't give you up! I can't! It hurts now, don't I know that. In six months or a year, the pain be all gone and then you'll be grateful. Yes, you will. You said: "Good old Sydney she was wiser than I thought. Bless her". Yes, Kit. You'll say: "Bless her". - But you'll be left alone. - Don't you worry about me. You can't be sure of yourself yet! Tomorrow you may think differently. Not tomorrow, Kit. Not a thousand tomorrows Nor you nor I can do anything to change it. We should be thankful. Thankful we found out in time Go, Kit. Dont lets talk to each other anymore. And we mustn't meet again before you sail. I'll take the train to London tonight. I'll drive by on way to the station. Perhaps you'll change your mind. - Goodbye. - No. Just go. As though you're only going into the next room. - Anybody to greet you around in front? - No, thanks very much. I'll just come across the garden. - I can't wait to get to her. - Hilary, are you absolutely certain about Margaret? - Surer than I am at life! - I am never sure of life. And less your love. God bless you. Good night. Good night. - Basset, where's the esquirebeau? - Is in the room, Sir. - Are our bags there? - Yes Sir, I packed them hours ago. - We reckon put in my car? - Yes, Sir. - Darling, why aren't you ready? - Gray. - I'm not going. - What? - I'm not going. - My dear you're all upset. No, its Hilary. He won't let me go. - We'll settle this. Where is he? - He went with Dr. Alliot to get the clearance. He's coming back to me. He convinced me, Gray. He cried. You must understand. He's so unhappy! I should have taken you with me today. I can't fight Hilary. I see it. Its my own fault. I ought never to have cared for you. Gray, don't look at me like that! - Did your promise to me mean nothing. - I got to put him first because he's weak. You are strong. Not strong enough for that. I want my wife. I waited along while for you If Hilary is left alone, he'll go mad again. I'm losing all i love to you. -There's no more to lose. - All you love. - You don't know th meaning of it. - Don't say that! I love you. Can't you see that? Can't you feel it? I starve, I'm going to live without you loke cut grass in the sun! - I can't see such pain. - You think I can't suffer? But he's sort of defenceless! I can't do it. I'd rather die! - Father! - They are in there again, your mother and that man. - She told him she loves him. - I heard! - You mustn't! I'm done with her! - Get them out at once. Do not let her suffer! At once or I'll kill her. - Father please! No! - I'll kill you! You stay here! I'll do it! I'll do it. You promised to go calm. - No, father. I will send Gray away. - No, both of them! I can't bear seeing either! - All right, father. - I'm going. I'll go. You stay here. I'll get rid of him. I'll get rid of them somehow. Remember you promised, go slow. - You're leaving every chance of happiness. - I can't help it. Pardon me. Mother, you must go with Gray. - You must go now before father comes back. - No, I wont leave him alone! - Fathers my job, not yours. - I wouldn't put the burden on you. That wouldn't be a burden, Mother. I understand you. You're frightened of him, I'm not. Don't you see you'll be no good to him. I know how it feels. I'm his own fleas and blood. You're not. I can manage him and make him happy. You can't! But Kit, Sydney, after your marriage? Don't you worry about Kit and me, we'll work everything out together. But I promised I'll be here when Hilary came. He had no right to ask it. You had no right to promise it - You both be utterly miserable. - Can't you see how true that is? He knows you love Gray. You think you'll ever make him forget that? No, I suppose I can't. By staying you'll destroy the lives of all. Please go before poor father comes back. You mean, I can go? Yes, mother. - Gray. - You are afraid to trust yourself? Always I've been afraid of Hilary. Of everything, of life. But now I'm not afraid. Come on, my dear. Goodbye, darling. - Seems so strange! - Goodbye, mother. -Be happy. - Goodbye, Sydney. - Goodbye, Gray. - Darling! Goodbye, Meg. - Father! - Its for the best, isn't it? You can say, like that - when just now you...? - She'll be happy, wont she? You'll be good to her. You did it. You did that so that I send them away. You loved her. She only pity'd me. She loves him. I heard her. Poor Meg! I've never really known her at all Everythings gone. I'm not going. Theres that boy, Kit? Thats all done in. You love him. - You're crying. - No. Don't you love him? I suppose so. Then, why? why? We're in the same boat, father. Daddy! You poor old thing! How do you think you'll keep me. I need you. Just as much as you need me. You need me? Ofcourse! My little Sydney. My darling. I'll make it up to you. We'll have a good time together somehow. Wont we? We'll be happy together. - You and I. - Yes, father. You and I. Whats that? Nothing. - Whats that you're playing? - Don't you recognise it? Its my sonata, isn't it? I've forgotten all about it. I love to know. You never finished it, I tried to myself in all sorts of ways. - No, darling, your hands wont go like that. - Well is. - Its the silly old thing! - Whose the silly old thing? The end of it should be further. Should bear it up... reaching a clmax. Who is that lovely father you think? Why not? You're not born that way?
