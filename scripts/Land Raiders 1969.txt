Good morning, Mr. Carden. All right, pick up those supplies and take it back to the house. And no stopping at the saloon, understand? - We got seven of them. - Yeah. And they're all bucks. Loomis! Pay these two, out back. There you are, Loomis. - Good morning, Mr. Carden. - Hello, Frank. Come on in. Sit down. - The Apache hit me again last night. - I heard. - How many head of cattle did they get? - Twenty killed, 50 run off. - All gone. - Bastards. I'm pulling stakes, Mr. Carden. I just can't cut it. It's different with you. A big spread like yours, the Apache leave you alone. A small spread like mine... Me and the missus were talking it over and... About the money I owe you. No rush. Thought maybe you might want to buy us out. I mean, since your spread hooks up with ours... How much, Frank? - Well, I paid $2 an acre. - Yeah. And that was for raw land. Now, with the house and the outbuildings I put up... I figure maybe... $4 would be fair. $4? That would give me enough to pay you off... and leave me and the missus a little traveling money. - When do you want to pull out? - Right away. Today, even. The missus is packing up already. Ruth's scared, Mr. Carden. Real scared. She doesn't want to spend another night in the place. I understand. $4. Let me think about it, Frank. I could come back in an hour or so if... I'll let you know tomorrow. But... All right, Mr. Carden. Loomis. Yes, sir? I'm buying the Willis ranch. - Make out the papers. - How much? $2.50. Thank you very much for your hospitality, ma'am. You'll find my husband in his office in town, Major. Then my men and I will be moving on now. I'm sorry you missed him, Major. I'm afraid you've had a very long ride out here for nothing. Any ride through the Carden ranch is a long ride, Mrs. Carden. Martha! Papa! - You shouldn't be here. - Who are these people? What do they want? Major, this is my father-in-law. Papa, this is Maj. Tanner. He's the new commandant at Fort Harmony. - He came to see Vicente. - My pleasure, Mr. Carden. No, seor. That is how my son Vicente call himself. Carden. I am still Juan Cardenas. We live in a changing world, sir. No, seor, words, things, they do not change the world. This rancho, it was built in Mexico. Now it is in the territory of Arizona, but the same cattle eat the same grass. Nothing has changed. Come and see. Papa's very proud of his bull. Isn't he magnifico, seor? Just like his father's father. But your bull has changed. Now he's for breeding, not fighting. I'll be getting into Forge River... if I'm going to see your son, Seor Cardenas. My apologies again for disturbing you, Mrs. Carden. Not at all, Major. It was our pleasure. Papa, you know you shouldn't be out of bed. What is it, Papa? Pablo. Today is two years since he left... and still I do not know why. Why, Martha? Why? Wait! You can't leave like this! Ride off without a reason. You're my son! You belong here. This is your home! Pablo. What is it? Vicente? You and Vicente? You're brothers! No. No more. This anger between you and Vicente must stop. I love you. I love you both. I need you here, with me. Pablo! Listen to me! - Is your name really Luisa? - S. What is so strange about that? Nothing. You are lying, Toro, I can tell. But why? You once knew a girl by the name of Luisa, maybe. See? I'm right. Tell me about her. What was she like? Was she as pretty as I am? Was she? What's the matter, Toro? Don't you think I'm pretty? Don't you? You're beautiful. Tell me again. Marry me, Pablo. - Marry me now. - No. Then when? - When we can get a place of our own. - But you have a place of your own. It's my brother's. Vicente, always Vicente. He has taken an Americano wife. He wants you to have one, too. He is making a gringo out of you! - No. - S. - No. - No what, Toro? As a matter of fact... this bounty for Apache scalps is what I came to see you about, Mr. Carden. Gen. Markham wants to make peace with the Indians. My orders are to rebuild Fort Harmony and stop the killings out here. - On both sides. - Markham? - So he's a general now, huh? - You know him? Yes, I know him, that gutless wonder. He was in command of Fort Harmony... when the Apaches brought it down around his ears. Still sitting on his rump in Fort Buchanan? The General feels... you're aggravating an already dangerous situation, Mr. Carden. And he'd appreciate it if you'd withdraw this bounty offer. Would he? Listen, Major... I don't give a damn what the General feels or what he wants. There's no law against killing Apaches. And until there is, I'm gonna go on doing just that. Do you know, I was born down the road about five miles... before there even was a road. That was all Mexico then. So no one's gonna teach me about Apaches. My family fought them for a hundred years... before the United States Army fired their first shot. Major... a lot of people say this won't bring peace. Peace. You can't have it with the Apache. They say that this is their country, that we've got to get out or we've got to die. Major, I don't intend to get out. And I don't intend to die. And Gen. Markham can go to hell! And when I see him, I'll tell him! I'd like to be a fly on the wall when you do, Mr. Carden. As I said, I brought this up at the General's request. - Would you like a drink, Major? - Thank you. Tell me, then... just where do you stand with the Apaches? When I received orders transferring me to Fort Harmony... friends of mine who know you... said we'd probably see eye to eye on this problem. Well, Major, you know, as far as I'm concerned... there is no problem. There's just Apaches. Don't forget anything, Toro. Pablo. Pablo. Pablo Cardenas! Is this a ghost I am seeing or is it really you, Pablito? What's the matter? Don't you remember me? Arturo! Arturo Morales! I worked for you at the rancho, for your brother. Don't you remember, for three years. - S. I remember... - You remember me? Pablito! Nobody can forget Arturo, you know. Lots of people try to forget me, but they cannot forget Arturo. Have a drink with me before you go. Gracias. Now I know why you come to this pigpen, my friend. For that one. Oh, yeah. Toro, huh? Maybe you will marry her and bring her home for your brother to see. If you do that, my friend, I will go home with you... just to see the look on his face. Pablo, forgive me... but your brother Vicente, he's becoming too much of a gringo. It's not enough that he talks and acts like a gringo... but now he think like a gringo. For three years I worked for him. Three years. Last week I said to myself, "Arturo, you're a fool. "You're a fool. Enough!" So I quit. No more trabajar. Now I will go to Nogales. I will steal some gringo horses, manage to live, no? - Don't go with him. - Who is this guy? - He's somebody. - Go upstairs. - Who the hell are you to tell me what to do? - Look, mister... why do you want to make trouble over a two-bit tart? That's right, a tart. And I'm not the only one who's had her. So has every trail hand and stumblebum in this town. Bravo, Pablito! Bravo! Let him go, please let him go! They're breaking my place. No! What are you doing, Luisa? Let them fight! They're only boys, let them fight for Luisa! What are you doing, my little chicken? They're breaking my place. Stop! What are you doing, Luisa? My darling, my little chicken. No, let them fight, let them play. Very good, Pablito! Let me go! Oh, my friend. Amigo, do not waste good tequila. Mi amigo, I think we'd better finish our drink in another cantina. - Oh, Luisa! - Come back! You dirty pig! You're not going to get away like this! You owe me money! You tramp. You whore. "Marry me, Pablo, marry me now!" And all the time with someone else's kid in your belly! Pablo! I could not help it. He took me, he forced me. I only wanted your child. Believe me, it's not what Vicente says. - Who was it? Who was it? - I can't tell you. I can't. Don't ask me. Bravo, Pancho, bravo. The rurales will never chase anyone this far. Anyway, I like better the rurales than working for your brother. Tell me, amigo, where are you headed? I think I'll go up to the Rio Perdido. You want to come along? No, gracias. No trabajar for me. - You'd rather steal them than catch them. - S. One question, amigo. That fight back there in the cantina. Why? Over a woman like that. It was loco. S, it was loco. Then why? Because her name was Luisa. Yes. I remember. Luisa Rojas. You're a stranger, Julio. God is the stranger, Padre. We've come to put flowers on her grave. Today was her birthday. Papa, it's beautiful! Oh, thank you. Happy birthday, Luisa. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Luisa. Happy birthday. Come into church, you and Maria. For words of comfort, Padre? What words of comfort do you have for an old man... on a day such as this? None, I'm afraid. You'll have to find your own comfort, Julio. But to find it, you must seek it. Come to mass on Sunday, Julio. Padre, I will make you a promise. I will come back to mass again... on the day that I can walk through this churchyard... and spit on the grave of Pablo Cardenas. May he burn in hell! Frank, help me! Oh, no. Frank? Help! Frank! A fly on the wall. Pretty funny. Maj. Tanner has quite a sense of humor. Yeah, he's a good man, Maj. Tanner. He came up the hard way, you know. Fought the Sioux... and the Cheyenne... and the Kiowa. He knows what it means. Before he left today... I got the contract to supply beef to Fort Harmony. I'll get the remount contract, too, when he gets settled down there. You know something? I can do Tanner a lot of good and he knows it. By the way, the Willises are moving out. Frank was in my office this morning. And he wanted me to buy his spread right there and then, and move out. But I'm going to let him sweat it out. Kind of soften him up a little bit. - Vince. - Honey. - Vince. - What's the matter? I wonder what the hell he wants. - Good evening, John. - What happened? - The Willises. - The Apaches again? - Burned them up. - Kill them? - Frank. - And Ruth? - Not so lucky. They took her with them. - Oh, God. And you wanted him to sweat it out, to soften him up. Are you blaming me? Come back. Guys like Willis, they shouldn't be here. They can't take care of themselves. Well, with the soldiers at Fort Harmony, maybe things will be different, huh? What can one troop of cavalry do? Get those red cutthroats. You can't kill all the Apaches in Arizona, Vince. You know something, Mayfield? You make me sick, you and the rest of those bleeding hearts. I think you should take those bounty posters down, Vince. - Do you? - It's because of them Frank was killed. - The Apaches have been leaving us alone! - Leaving us alone? They've just been waiting, waiting to murder, to rob and to kill! That's what they're like... and you've been round here long enough to know that! You want to know something, Mayfield? I think you're getting just like everybody else around here. Getting tired. Maybe you've been a lawman too long. Maybe you need another kind of a job. Neck's broken. Her horse, it must have thrown her. Ought to make Forge River by tomorrow morning, Miss Kate. I was beginning to wonder if we'd ever get there. I bet your pa is thinking the same thing right now. Seor! - Where's the wagon master? - That's Ken Harper. You'll find him up ahead, scouting out a place to noon. Gracias. Paul Carden. - Do you know him? - I used to. In a way. Circle your wagons! Circle your wagons! We'll noon here! Drive in your horses. Mr. Harper! I'd keep moving if I were you. Seen some Apache smoke. Could be up to something, but I'm not sure. I wouldn't take any chances with Apaches. Keep moving, you could make town by dark. Mister, we've been on this trail for three months. I'm not gonna scare the daylight out of folks... and keep moving all day without resting, just because you saw some Apache smoke. - Your wagons. - That's right. Circle the wagons. All right, close them up. Come on, drag in those horses. Come on, move on! - Paul! - Circle those wagons in here. - Hello. - Kate Mayfield. - Now get them moving out, come on. - How are you? I didn't recognize you. I mean, the last time I saw you, you were... Now... It's been a long time. Four years. - What are you doing with this outfit? - I just came back from going to school. You've been back east all this time? How's Forge River? It's about the same, I guess. I don't really know... I haven't been there myself for a couple of years. I thought you knew about... I mean, I thought maybe your father would have written you about... About what? I've really got to be going. I'm due up at the Rio Perdido. Good seeing you again. Injuns! Mr. Harper, Injuns! Get in your wagons. Get those horses out of here. Harper, you cannot outrun them. We've got to get out. Pass the word. Move! Harper. Mr. Harper, wait. Wait. Wait, you'll get cut to pieces out there. Paul, come here. No, wait! When I tell you to jump, do it. You understand? Jump! Take him into Doc Radford's office. Mayfield and the others are back. Well? Wiped out. We buried them, the ones we could find. - And your daughter? - No sign of her. Yeah? It wasn't just a band of renegades that hit that train. - This could be the beginning of a real war. - So? Mr. Mayfield! Kate. Luisa Rojas? The way I hear it, Doc Radford found out after she was dead. I always figured that Carden kid was taking her out behind the barn. - Or she was taking him? - Wounded? But the Sheriff said it was an accident. The fellow that killed her wanted it to look that way. He wouldn't be the first fellow who got a girl into trouble... and then killed her 'cause he didn't want to marry her. - Who did you say got her in the family way? - Paul. This is a nice surprise. Hello, Paul. I'd like to talk to you. S, I will take him. And the saddle we talked about, too. - For what you did, thanks very much. - I was saving my own neck, too. Still. How've you been? Fine. Kate tells me you were heading for the Rio Perdido... when you caught up with the wagon train. S. - Means you won't be in Forge River long? - You don't have to worry, Sheriff. - I'm sorry, Paul. You understand I... - I understand what people think. They think that I killed Luisa. But what I do not understand is, what do you think? If I'd thought you killed her, I'd have arrested you. No, that is not true. Not if my brother said no. Vince runs you like the rest of this town, and everyone knows it. - So why try to deny it? - Please, I'm... Just answer me one question. Do you think I killed Luisa? - No. - But it would be better if I was not in town... to remind people, perhaps, that it was not an accident, huh? But it was. Why don't you have the guts to tell that to this town and make it stick? - Your horse, seor. - Gracias. My brother will pay for this. Won't he, Sheriff? Paul. - Vince told me I'd find you here. - I was just leaving. Then nothing has changed between you? - Won't you stay and give it another chance? - What's the matter, Martha? Are you getting a little lonesome out there with Vince? Paul. Papa's sick, very sick. He had a heart attack six weeks ago. He needs you. Look, I don't know what this quarrel is between you and Vince... but Papa's the one that's paying for it. It isn't fair. He loves you, Paul. Go and see him. Go and see him. Papa. Pablo. I knew you would come. I was waiting. I knew you would come. No, it is not true. I did not know. But I never stopped to pray. Pablo, tell me, where have you been? What have you been doing? Nothing much, Papa. Everything has been well. I've been here and there. But what about yourself? How are you? Fine. Now, Pablo, fine, s. Soon we ride together. You, Vicente and I, huh? Papa. Pablo, you remember once before you ride off without answering? Not again. I'm your father. I want to know why you refused to stay in your own home. My home? Yes. Yours, Vicente's and mine. We built this rancho together. No, Papa. We had nothing to do with it. If it was not for Vince, you would still be herding sheep... and I would be there with you. This is his ranch. He built it. What he didn't build, he bought, and what he could not buy, he stole. Everything here has his brand on it. Is that why you hate him? No, Papa, I do not begrudge him one inch of this ranch. Then why? This you must ask him. He must tell you. I asked him. He say he does not know. - Then he is a liar. - Then you tell me. I cannot, Papa. Or maybe... Pablo, because I'm old now. But I am afraid. Afraid? Yes, afraid for Vicente. Always rich, rich. Always want more. Martha, too, I think. She doesn't say, but I think she's afraid, too. Pablo, please stay. Stay here. Help us. Papa, there's nothing I can do. Besides, I came here to say hello to you. It was good to see you again, but I must go. Pablo. - Are you leaving? - S. I want to talk to you. Talk, damn you. You're having one hell of a time tearing yourself to pieces... because of this little Rojas bitch, aren't you? Okay, so you loved her. Or thought you did, until you found out what she really was. - What was she? - You know. I know what you say she was, what you want me to believe she was. You tramp. You whore. If I could believe she was a tramp, maybe I could forget her. But it doesn't work. There's something missing. Believe me, it's not what Vicente says. You know, it's time you snapped out of it. Stopped drifting and whoring around and be somebody. Like you? To change my name? Marry Americana? Maybe you act and think like a gringo... but you're not fooling anyone except maybe yourself. I know where I'm going. For God's sakes, you know what's happened? This isn't Mexico any more. This is gringo country. You're a gringo or you're dirt. And so you're gringo? To hell with the gringos! Maybe all I'll ever be is big enough so it doesn't make any difference. But my kids will make it, or theirs will. The old man asked you to stay. If I were you I wouldn't go too far away... if you want to get back in time for the funeral. If you leave this time, it'll kill him. Remember that! You've got a job on your hands, Major. Quite a job. But we'll make it. Have a look. I'm bringing a herd of mustangs through Apache country. I need a few of your men to see them through. I'm sorry, Carden, but my men aren't permitted... to operate south of the Forge River. Major, what's this about... your men not being able to operate south of the river? Why, just that. We're not even patrolling that area any more. Orders. What the hell's going on? I'm going to tell you something in confidence, Mr. Carden. There's a man named Evans coming out here from Washington. He's the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. And I have instructions to arrange a meeting for him with the Apaches. - More peace talk. - And this time it might work. He'll be authorized to offer the Indians a reservation of two million acres... extending from the south bank of the Forge to the Horse Mountains. I'll show you. Major, that's open range. And my herd's been watering and grazing on that land. The Apaches don't come cheap. Then why doesn't the government give them the whole damn territory... and be over with it? It might well come to that. Sgt. Crocker! Put your men on that firing step and put some safety lines on that gate. When is this Evans coming to town? I want to talk to him, Major. He'll be passing through Forge River tomorrow morning... on his way to Fort Buchanan. He's just liable to learn a few of the facts of life... before he leaves this territory. I've been looking all over for you. I wanted to thank you for saving my life. Father said she was killed when her horse threw her. A lot of people don't believe that. They think... I know what they think. Are you walking back to town? Well, I have my horse here. But I suppose he would not mind a walk. Stick with the herd! And then the headmistress looked down her long nose and said: "Miss Mayfield... "here at the Holly Riding School for young ladies, when one rides side-saddle... "one never feels justified as far as saying that that"... Get out of the way, seorita. I don't want to hurt you. Go, Kate. You killed my Luisa. No, Julio, I did not. It was an accident. You lie. Julio, it was an accident. Stampede! Move out of the street. Stampede! Out of the way. Julio. You... Strange. That's the thanks I get. Go away. Paul. What is it you want? Paul... I must talk to you. Everybody wants to talk to me. Except Julio. He was the only one who did not want to talk. Paul, you've got to get out of Forge River. Now. And never come back. Yesterday you asked me to stay. Yesterday I thought you could stay. I thought you and Vince could patch up whatever difficulty there was between you... just for Papa's sake. But I was wrong. I know that now, after last night. You are talking to the wrong Cardenas. It was Vince who killed Julio. You both killed Julio, you and Vince. Your hatred of each other, that's what killed him. And it's not going to stop there. It's going to go on and on until either you kill Vince or Vince kills you. Paul, you've got to get out of town for your own sake. Vince kills and I run. And this is for my sake, s? Not for Vince's, not for yours. It's just for me, huh? Paul, for all our sakes, this killing has got to stop. You're his wife. You know what he is. You're not blind. You live in his house, you sleep in his bed. You get your share of everything he grabs... and that is why you stay with him! You are in the same dirt that he is. You come here and you talk to me like Mother Superior. Do you know what you are under those fancy clothes? - You're nothing but a whore! - Paul. - And I'll show you how we treat whores. - Paul! Don't, for God's sake. Do you hate him that much? Stop it, Paul. You're hurting me. All right, Paul, listen to me! All right, Paul! All right. All right. All right. I won't fight you. Just promise you'll get out of town. Before it's too late. Goodbye, Paul. That will be Evans. Hold it there. Hold! Faster! Hold it! Now go! That's enough, Carney. Let's get out of here. Is he dead? Why would anyone want to do a thing like this? The coach was carrying nothing of value. No attempt was made to rob Evans or the others. White men. Could be the three men he saw were scared off. By what? The Apaches who hit the stage. They could have ridden off before you saw them. Without taking the horses or lifting hair? What kind of Apaches have you been fighting, Major? - What do you think, Sheriff? - You have already told him what he thinks. You watch your tongue, boy. Do you understand what this means? If the Apaches are blamed for this, there will be no peace. This territory will be up to its ass in blood. That is what some people want. Want it so bad they would do anything to make it happen. Now you look. I asked you to stay for the old man's sake. Now I'm asking you to go. To get out and to stay out. For God's sakes, Mayfield, do not let this happen. This is government business. It's none of mine. My brother is starting a war. That is everyone's business. - Father, listen to him. - You stay out of this, Kate. There's nothing I can do. Nothing. You said your brother runs this town. You're right. I'm not gonna buck him. I fought my last fight a long time ago. - Everybody, meeting in the saloon! - Father. Meeting in the saloon! - Meeting in the saloon. - I'm sorry, Kate. Meeting in the saloon. Let's go. To the saloon, everybody. - Paul, what are you going to do? - Someone has to stop Vince. Not you. If he wants a war with the Apaches, then let him have it. And if the town is blind enough to follow, then let them. There is more to it than that. And I'm not the only one who's had her. It's something that has nothing to do with the Apaches. It is something between my brother and me. ...and the man the government sent to talk peace with the Apaches... was killed by the Apaches. - That's how much they want peace... - Now, listen. You've got three choices. One: you can get out. Just pack up and leave. Or number two: you can just sit and wait. Wait until they attack your ranch. Until they burn your homes and your crops to the ground... until they steal your cattle, until they murder your wife and children. Or number three. Three: you could do what I'm gonna do... is you can get after these sons of bitches and stay after them... until there's not one Apache scalp left in the whole Arizona territory. Wait, wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on! What about the army? Yes, what about the army, Major? Well, I can send a message to Gen. Markham... and get permission to take action against the Apaches. And what are we supposed to do? Just stand up and cheer? It'll take a week to get an answer. By that time the Apaches will have burnt us all to the ground. Now listen... one United States government man has been killed. Our homes and our properties are being threatened... and he would like us to stick around and wait for notice. - And what else can I do? - You can damn well do what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go out after these savages and teach them a lesson they'll never forget. And before I'm finished... I'll have all these walls filled with Apache hair. No, you cannot do that! You cannot do that! It was not the Apaches that attacked the stage. It was not the Apaches that killed a government man! You ask my brother. I think my brother wants to tell you something. I think my brother wants to tell you that it wasn't the Apaches who attacked the stage. I think he wants to tell you that it was those three white men... who wanted it to look like Apaches. And I think my brother wants to tell you something else. He wants to tell you that I was in on it. Wait. Wait. That I had Evans killed... because he was coming here to make the Forge River Valley an Apache reservation. That's what my brother says. My brother. Well, I say that my brother's wrong. But that's up to you. You make your own decision. Who are you going to believe? Someone who's been with you through the years... helping you protect your family and your property... and trying to make this a decent town to live in? Or this spineless stud... who pulled up his pants and ran like hell when he got a little Mexican girl in trouble? But I don't give a damn. You do what you want. I'm going after those Apaches if I have to do it alone. What are we waiting for? Let's go! No. You cannot do this. No, wait, you must stop. Come back! I swear they will kill you. No. We must stop this! I thought you said you'd fought your last fight. We'll talk about that when I get back. Right, Pete, go on home. And bring your rifle. We'll need every man we can get our hands on. If you go with them I won't be here when you get back. I have to go with them. Because Vince Carden says so? Yes. Why? He owns me. He owns you? How do you think I could afford to keep you in school for four years? - But you told me that... - I lied. I've never made more than $50 a month in my life as a lawman. I couldn't even save enough money to pay your stage fare back east. So Vince Carden owns me, too. Is that what you're trying to say? Well, don't. Because it isn't true. I wasn't yours to sell. Kate. Hurry up, John. I'm not going. All right. I'll see you later. Goodbye, ma'am. I knew I never should have been a lawman. The first time I pinned this badge on me, I stuck myself. Father. Paul. My father's not going. You're a little late, don't you think? If you had said something in the saloon, you might have stopped them. Maybe I still can. You hit them from here. We'll come up from the riverbank. We'll probably only find kids and squaws. The bucks are off with Juantez. All right, you fought with Col. Chivington, Major. Remember what he told his men at Sand's Creek? "Kill them all, big and little. Nits make lice." All right? You hear that? Carden, we've done enough. Kill them! Every one of them! Sound recall. Recall! Come back! Come on, Vince, let's get out of here. God! - We can't make it. - Well, we're gonna find out. The Apaches ain't gonna take this lying down. There'll be hell to pay. I'm getting out till it's over. Whisky. - We did all right. - We made one mistake. When we finished off that camp we should have gone after Juantez and his bucks. Yeah, well. Too bad these cavalry boys have got cold feet. By the way, where is the Major? Waiting for you at your office. Him and his men are staying in town, just in case. In case of what? The Apache do something. He's scared. You're all scared. You don't want to fight for what's yours, why the hell don't you get out? Someone get the doctor. Father! Get Doc Radford, quick! - Give me a hand, please. - Father? Make a light. Hello, Major. Enjoying my liquor? What are you easing, your nerves or your conscience? It'll take more than a drink to do either. First time I've ever seen so many people so upset for a few stinking Indians. Nobody put a gun to your head to make you come along. No. Well, if you want to bellyache, get the hell out of here and do it somewhere else. All weak-kneed sons of bitches. - Is he still unconscious? - Yeah. Do not worry. The doctor will fix him up fine. What are you thinking? - Just then? - S. I was just thinking about the night you hurrahed the town. Remember? What are you celebrating? - When is your birthday? - Not until next August. Then happy birthday next August! I loved it. It was the best birthday party I've ever had. Paul, I'm frightened. He's awake. He wants you. - I'll look in later. - Good. I want you to know the truth. I was filling my canteen at Jasper's Creek. I heard voices. You must help me. You need not worry, I have not told anyone. Only Paul knows. I had to tell him. - Paul knows what? - That I'm going to have a baby. But that's all I said, Vicente. Very soon everyone's going to notice. What can I say? I don't give a damn what you say. It's your kid. Just don't try and say I had anything to do with it... or you'll wish to hell you'd never been born. Filthy cholo. You think I'm some Apache squaw you can spit on when you are through with her? I'll tell everyone. I'm going to tell the whole town. I am not afraid of you. I'm going to tell. Everybody's going to know. Luisa Rojas is going to have a child of Vicente Cardenas... the brother of the man she was supposed to marry. I'm going to tell everyone. You'll see, I'll tell. I will say it. I will say it. You'll see, I'll say it, I'll tell... He was in one of his blind rages. I was afraid to interfere. Afraid for myself. Paul. You killed her. What? Luisa. Hey, Carney, here. I'll kill you! Get Carney! Hey, Carney! Let's get the hell... Barker, Lane, Picerni, come with me. Get that powder out of here. Unhitch those horses. It's gonna blow, get out of here! No! Father. Father. Fall back, men. Fall back! How do we get out of here? - We don't. - What? Paul. Paul. Come on, Paul. Please. Paul. I came as soon as I could. - Vince... - I know. And Papa, too. He went to sleep just before the attack. He didn't wake up. It's as if he knew that... As if he knew everything was over. - If you'd like to... - No. I said goodbye to him a long time ago. Paul. You and Vince. Tell me. It can't make any difference now, can it? What did he do to make you hate him so? Martha, why did you marry him? Because I loved him. Isn't that enough to remember?
