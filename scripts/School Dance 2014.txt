We go now live to Monte Vista where students were gathered for the annual school dance. Well, Officer Lagney and I arrived at the scene to find these "packs" of gang members in the midst of gun violence. We immediately pounced the evildoers and we had the situation under control. Yeah, we have to take care of this before more innocent kids are hurt. Bunch of savages. Animals that belong in a zoo. First of all, that cop is high as hell. Look at him. Second of all, that's not even how it went down. Let me rewind to the beginning. This was actually the greatest night of my life. Would you believe me if I told you it was a tale of love? The cops may have labeled it a tragedy, but you can never trust the police. Hey, this is my story. So I should tell you, it'll probably be a little racist. Where you gonna be at tonight? You best believe that you're gonna be over at Monte Vista High School because it's going down. Supa Sizers out there with their smash hit The Hater Dance will be in the neighborhood, man. It's Power 106's annual "Unity in the Community" school dance going down at Monte Vista High School. Power 106. Well, I love that Supa Sizer. That motherfucking Hater Dance song is the shit. I'm not gonna give in to that Supa Sizers' song. Press it just as soon as I can. You want Mamma to walk you in, baby? No, Mamma, I'm good. You ain't good, nigga. You ain't about four feet goddamn tall. Hold on. Your Mamma coming. I don't want nobody fucking with my baby. Ma! I protects my baby. Come on. Let's go. Now, listen. If some shit goes down, I want you to page me, all right? Ma, nobody uses pagers no more. We got iPhones. Man, I know what's going on in these streets, God help you. Ma, I promise, I'm good. All right, well, listen, I gotta get to the motherfucking church anyway. Go in there and make Mamma proud. Learn something. Give Mamma a kiss, little baby, before I go. Kiss me, nigga, before I blow... I love you. Take care and learn something today. Make Mamma proud, you little bitch. Tell your teacher I said, "Hey." You got something for me? Yeah, I got something. Hold on. All right. Roll on, I got you. I got you. You don't put that football down, I'll fuck your ass up. The Rangers, those dudes are amazing. Best dance clique in our school. And one of them is actually my older cousin. Day Day. I met him at a family reunion once, but I don't even think he remembers my name. See, man, I'd do anything to be down with that clique. Now, that's what it's about here. Cliques. Now, they're not gangs, but it's far from that study-buddy shit. It's more so sororities and fraternities without the college education and social benefits. Let me explain. Each school is divided and segregated into cliques. Monte Vista is no different. You got your backpackers, the nerds, the vegan, tree-loving dreadheads. You got your dirty ghetto kids aka your hood skaters. Oh, and that's Stinkfinger. Across the street, you'll find the lamest fools to ever set foot in the hood. Girl, let me carry your books for you, girl. They all dropped out of school like 10 years ago but these fools still up here every single day. Bunch of old wannabe gangsters who wanna holler at young chicks but always fail miserably. We're not carrying any books. And if we were, you wouldn't be able to touch them. You wanna carry these balls then, bitch? Yeah, put the balls in your book bag, bitch. Told the bitch to carry my balls. Say what? I said, "Carry my balls, bitch." Come again, say what? Let's ride out. I know. That's right. Then there's the Ese's. The real gangsters. Legend has it if you look one of them in the eye, you could die. Where we come from, blacks and Mexicans have never gotten along. It's the ghetto civil war that defies logic. It's like vegetarians beefing with vegans. It's the same shit. See what I did there? And the most notorious badass Ese of them all is Big Junior. A while ago he got sent to prison for burning down a school dance 'cause he thought some blind guy was looking at his little sister. Who just so happens to be the girl of my dreams. Anastacia Moreno. I've been in love with her since we shared a nap-time towel in the first grade. I was so nervous, I pissed on myself, all over the towel, all over her. I sure enough did. She hasn't looked my way since. It's probably because we're from two totally different worlds. I mean, she's a Sweet Gyrl. A part of the hottest female clique that my school has ever birthed. Let's take a moment to enjoy. Man, look at her. She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Wait a minute. Is she looking at me? Jason B.B. Jackson. Oh, this is my shot. This is my moment. Seize the opportunity. Go get 'em, buckaroo. Oh, yeah, I forgot to introduce you to the Prairie Puff Man. The tobacco industry's propaganda pitchman that's been killing kids for years. I wasn't always super cool. Till I discovered these. My mother smokes eight packs of these death-doobies a day. And since she's a single parent, he's the only man I've ever seen in my house. Prairie Puff Man is like my guardian angel. Don't cheat. My role model. Go get 'em, buckaroo. My nigga, what the fuck, bro? What's that? Worst moment in the history of fucked-up-ness. Ay! He's so little. It looks like a dick but smaller. That is gross. Little dude ain't even circumcised! What was that, bro? Why you even looking at this nigga's dick? This nigga's dick look like Franklyn. Hey, bro, pull your pants up. He's still sitting there with his pants down. Hey! Wait up! Attention! It's 7:45. Will the student who lost their prosthetic leg please hop your ass down here to the guidance counselor's office. Hey, guys! Hey, guys! Wait up. Yo, how can I be a Ranger? I know everything about y'all. I got all your mix-tapes. I know all your dance moves. I was even thinking of getting a Ranger tattoo. Yo, this nigga is a stalker. I'll do whatever it takes, I swear. Okay, little piggy-in-the-blanket dick. You really want that Ranger life? Day Day, whip it out. Memorize it. Now, if you want to pledge to be in the illest clique, you got to get the drawers off one of the illest chicks. That's right. Panties. When you come back with a fresh pair of Sweet Gyrl panties, you're in. Uh, can't it be like a sock or something? Panties! Like these. These are Keisha's from last night. She just gave you those? For sure. All right, now here come them sugar drawers. Take your pick, little dude! Yo, yo, yo, snap out of it, Un-Circky! This Ranger shit is real. South Central wasn't built in no day. So can you pull it off or what? Uh, when am I supposed to have this done? Tonight. - Tonight? - Tonight. But you just said South Central wasn't built in a day. Uh, I don't know what that shit means. I just be saying shit. Y'all expect me to have sex with one of the most untouchable girls in our school tonight? Yeah. That's not even humanly possible. Yeah, it is. Tonight is the "Unity in the Community" school dance, fool. And it's a lock-in. And you know what happens at the lock-in, boy. Okay, for those of you that don't know what a lock-in is, let me explain. In an attempt to give all races and classes of students a safe party environment, and keep them away from gang violence, we have an all-night campus party that culminates in a sleep over, in the gym. Nice, safe and wholesome, right? Wrong. Instead of the lock-in, they need to call it the "get it in." Because that's all that's happening all night long. Everybody sneaks off somewhere to get their freak in... ...drink in, smoke in, and frolic in. But the main attraction is the Power 106 concert and talent show. Last year The New Boyz took home $2,000 and a major label record deal. Their lives changed forever. And they're coming back this year to judge and give another act a ticket out of the hood. Oh, shit, y'all. We're late! We better get to class. Nigga, we're The Rangers. We're not worried about being late to class. Yeah, we run this school. This school don't run us, extra meat. Yeah, nigga. Quit tripping. I'm with the big dogs running this school. This school don't run us. Ain't that right, dude? Langston? Tardy, tardy, tardy! Get your Hot Pocket-sized ass to my office! In here, sir. Little-ass homie, in here. Ain't that a rip? Damn. That's what's wrong with you kids. Your mind is filled with all that bullshit. I'm sick of it. If I was your daddy, I'd be the one who tore your ass up. I wouldn't play here. I wouldn't put up with none of it. That's right. I'm trying to... Ooh! Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that, that, that, that... Stop looking at my girl. I'm gonna tell you one time and I ain't gonna tell you no more. Keep your eyes and your mind off my bitch. I mean, my faculty. I'm sorry about that, Mrs. Johnson. She hears every damn thing. Everything! Yeah, she is a bitch sometimes. I needs to talk to you. About that little butt-naked dance you just did out there on the quad just a minute ago. Well... I'm not circumcised either. And I'm sixty-some years old, still ain't circumcised. Join the club! You've got a turtle-neck little dick, too. You got a German Shepherd dick. I got a German Shepherd dick. You got a Sean John leather on your dick. That's what you got. That's right. Levi leather. I know it. When your little dick gets a little blanket lint on it, and cookie crumbs, stuff like that, it's hard to blow out. I know what you're talking about 'cause I deal with it all the time. You ain't even gotta use a condom. Just twist the tip up like a balloon. That little ball will pop up. More pleasure! Principal Rogers. What? Is there any reason that you have me in your office? Yes, there's a reason why I got you in here. I wanted to ask you something. You having a problem out with 'em Ranger boys? The Rangers? No, they're my friends. That's what I'm talking about. See that! See that! I'm sitting here trying to defend you and you're running with 'em! I'm gonna tell you something, Jebediah, you're trying to start some shit around here. The Rangers, now, all of a sudden, is your friends. Ain't that a bitch. You run around here fooling with the Mexican kids. They're gonna fuck one of y'all up, up around here. Somebody's gonna bend you, spin you and go up in you. This is my school. And I won't play that. I don't like any of them one bit! Are you getting initiated into a gang, young Jiminey? Uh, my name is Jason, and no, I'm not. Cut the... I'm gonna tell you something, Jethro. You're gonna try and start a race riot. You better leave them Mexican kids alone, they're gonna jump on you. Yeah, four to five of them are gonna jump on your little ass. They're gonna have Home Depot little jackets on, they don't play the fool. Yeah. Damn shit. You think it's a game? You're gonna end up on First 38. First 38. I thought it was 48. Yeah, it's 38, nigga. Yes. I hear you need one more volunteer teacher tonight for the lock-in. And you heard right, baby. I need you here. Quicker than a cat can lick his ass. All right, great. I'll see you there. I'm gonna tear that ass up tonight. Huh? Are you going to the school dance tonight? Yeah, come on. Get your little nosey ass out of here. Get on out of here. The Hater Dance. The Hater Dance. The Hater Dance. Oh! What the fuck? It seems like today is your unlucky day, Day. That's funny, fool. Yeah. Yo, why y'all messing with me? I know you got some lawns to mow or something. So, Day Day, you have a really important phone call. Who's this? What? Nigga, speak English. Who's this? It's Junior. Just got out and he wants his money. Yeah, don't keep him holding on the phone, Holmes. That's rude. My bad, Junior. I didn't know it was you. How did you get out? I thought you were in jail for triple life. Look, man, I got your money. Don't worry. Insert 25 cents for another minute. What did he say? Don't ask me, fool. I don't speak Spanish. $2,000 by midnight or Junior's gonna kill you. Shit. 2 grand. Where am I gonna get that from by midnight? Day Day, you cool? Hell no. These Ese's are threatening me over some shit my wack-ass father did! Uncle D-Smoke? Yeah, that lying-ass nigga, Darren. See, my mamma thought it would be a good idea for me to go visit him in prison. Say, "Hi, Daddy!" Say, "Hi, Daddy!" Hi, Daddy. Whose goddamn white baby is that? This is your baby, okay? He's just light skinned. Mmm-hmm. That one might be mine. That one right there, I'm not totally sure. Just because you named him Darren don't mean he belongs to Darren. But I don't care what this baby's name is, this baby is rice skinned but not light skinned. That is a white child. That is Caucasian from the mountains of Caucasus. That is a Slavic baby, a Viking from Iceland. That baby got 730 as a credit rating right now as an infant. You the only one I've been with, Darren. Bitch, let me explain to you the math. I've been in here 16 consecutive years. You know how long "consecutive" is, don't you? Okay, so, it means one right after the motherfucking other. 'Cause I ain't never missed a day. So clearly you've been having some conjugal visits with some other motherfuckers other than me. That's not my baby. That's almost a grown white man you've brought in here. His glasses are certainly grown. I've never seen a baby with that type of prescription. And why does that baby look like Officer Joshua? Bitch, you've been fucking the guard? Ew! Nuh-uh! Hey, Darren, stop talking to my mom like that, man. Be respectful. You're absolutely right. I apologize for that. - It's just that this bitch... - Damn it. There you go again. Your mother was misbehaving. Sorry, I should've set a better example in front of the nice white gentleman and your mother. All right, so, could I please speak to my black son privately, please? Would that be okay with you, Trina? Mmm-hmm. I mean you no disrespect, sir. Hope to work for you one day when I get out. Come on, baby. Raggedy head... You have to excuse me, son. This is my first white baby. What's up, man? I'm in a jam. What? Uh... There was a gambling incident and I need, like, 13,000 cigarettes, preferably 6,000 of those non-menthol and then like 5,000 pineapple fruit cups. That's worth about $2,000 on the open street market. If you can handle that for me, I'd appreciate it. Darren, what are you talking about? Well, see, what had happened was... Wait, you're gonna do a flashback within a flashback? Nigga, you know you can't do that. Nigga, I'm a criminal. That's what I do, what I'm not supposed to do. So, now. What had happened was... No Mexican has ever beat me in Dominoes. Ever. But one day the cash was on the line, I had been sipping that lean and he caught me slipping. What's this got to do with me? This is your problem. Uh, I didn't have the money, and in lieu of the money, I told Junior and his crew that I had a rich son in a famous rap group, and I'm sure a little funky $2,000 don't mean nothing when he's clocking all the dollars out there, Mr. Major Buckety Bucks. What? Man, we ain't signed yet. I ain't got no money. All right, well, let's not be a Gloomy Gus. Okay, if you didn't learn nothing from your white brother, learn always look on the bright side of life. But you still haven't given him any money? No, I gave him an orange this morning. But they're already trying to make me make small booty payments and I only got a small booty to work with. Look here, man, um, I only got one booty hole. You understand what I'm saying? They don't take debit or credit or nothing in here, it's just hole. Okay? I've been holding onto it for 16 years. I don't see no reason to let it go now over a few little pineapple fruit cups and some cigarettes. Speaking of which, I need you to do me a favor. You think you can listen to these for me? That's disgusting, man. Where'd you pull that out from? Oh, from my Louis Vuitton prison bag. Nigga, what do you think? I pulled them out of my ass. You ain't got to smell it. Just listen to it. I know. I know. It's time. Look, I only got a few seconds before they snatch me up out of here 'cause I'm a gangster! But look, I need you to save my sphincter. You gonna embarrass me in front of that white man's child, you better lock me down! Some father I got, huh? Now I gotta pay Junior by midnight. Anyway, you get them drawers yet? I'm just messing with you. Come on, bro, we got PE. Wait, you noticed I was in your PE class? Yeah, man. I've seen you there before, looking all un-athletic and shit. Let's keep this Junior thing between me and you. It's 11:00. Get your wretched ass into class! Man! I'm in a tight situation. Go ahead. Keep laughing at my pain. But the struggle is real! Big Junior just magically got released from a triple life sentence. And he's on a mission to kill my cousin Day Day. And probably me too, once he finds out I'm trying to get his sister's panties. Are those panties really worth dying for? She probably got some really nice panties. I guess I gotta do what I gotta do. It's like my man Shakespeare said, "Love is a smoke, made from the fumes of sighs, "being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes." Get your asses up for some aerobics. Stand your asses up! Don't make Coach mad today. Don't make me mad! Come on now. Let's get into this Hater Dance, shall we? 5, 6, 7 and 8. And to the left. Whoo! Yeah! Come on, guys. Man, what the hell you doing, piddly dick? Move like you got some damn rhythm. Come on. Now step, yeah, side to side, yeah, side to side, yeah, side to side. Oh, yeah! Keep going. Mmm! Do the dance. Not so hard, Venkatesh! Not so hard. Okay? Hey. I'm so sick of this damn song! Yeah, but I do like the way B3's booty shakes to that dance. Mmm! What's a B3? Man, you gotta keep up with the acronyms if you're gonna be a Ranger. B3 is Big Booty Becky. Oh. Come on, J-Extra. Let's roll over there right now. I like that, J-Extra. That's your new name. Yeah. That's right. Dougie's with it, boy. That's the Fredrick Douglass right there, you old nigga. Can we help you, little boy? No love. Little homie with us. Oh, I'm sorry, Langston. I didn't know. Hey. Didn't we go to pre-school together? Uh, me? No. See, I'm from Nigeria. Oh! Oh... Yeah. That's it. You peed on me in elementary school. - What? - What? What are y'all doing, not participating in my calisthenics, huh? Coach, we're tired of doing that fake-ass electric slide, man. The Hater Dance is loved by everybody. We don't like it. Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that. Baby Chris Rock face. Why you hate The Hater Dance, huh? You gotta like it! Okay? We're about what's popping next, not now! Yeah, we about to give you a little taste of what we gonna do tonight. Check it out! Who painted your back? Little Negro division? Watch this, little niggas. Yo, we killed that. We definitely gonna win tonight. Bro, you already know what's up. I know you saw how Jasmine was on me. That's gonna be my butt down tonight. Nigga, yeah, right! You know her daddy's a pastor. What? Are you doubting the powers of a Ranger? My fault. I repent. Yo, yo. Check that out. That's confidence right there. Day Day still ain't gonna smash, but at least he's confident. I don't know, bro. This whole Sweet Gyrl thing's a little bit out of my league. I couldn't even get my name out. I blew it. Don't trip, you'll get another chance. No, you won't, little nigga. Mrs. Johnson, report to the office. Mrs. Johnson, report to the office. Hi, Mrs. Johnson. Hi, boys! Damn! Stop looking at my bitch! Well, students, it's 12:30. Lunch time, reduced lunch, bring your lunch. Hell, no lunch. Hey, man, look at these little niggas! Need to move. Move, man! Word! Man, that's why The Rangers is gay. Nigga, what the fuck you say? You heard what he said, fool. Y'all are gay! Man, that's the best you could come up with? Yeah! Yeah? Cue these niggas off, yo! Our little nigga's funny. This Ranger game, man Look at these suckers We run this school Y'all niggas don't want it Hot, like your mamma coochie in the summer The shit don't stop Dillinger Dude, you assed-out Plumber!

You must think Billingsly is a punk bitch? Because you are treating me like a bitch, coming up in my class all late and shit! Ms. Billingsly, it's not even like that. And I bet your ass didn't do the homework assignment either, huh? Well, actually, I have something... Uh-huh? I mean, I liked it. It's formatted correctly. The words are beautiful.

"Admiring from afar "Courting in secret "Wishing for my star "My prayers to keep it "You are my star "In the safety of my dreams "You are my star "Beauty gazing for what seems "Like an eternity "Too fearful for speaking "Too nervous for flirting "My words escape me "Yet flourish from the page "Maybe it's not yet my season "My love ferments with age "I guess I must wait "I confess I must say "You are my star, you are my star "But I am just a glimmer in the galaxy of your existence "But I go unnoticed from a distance "Burned by your heat "I've yearned for so long "For you without me is like a singer with no song "Yet still, you are my star." Oh, shit! That motherfucker was hella dope. Thank you. Students, it's 3:00. School is over. The school dance is tonight. No gang attire. No lace front. No thongs. No C-section scars. See you tonight.

I mean, I've got the vocals. Just not much of a songwriter. Maybe you should let me help you with that. Yeah? That would be cool. I guess I owe you now. No. You don't owe me. It's the least I could do after peeing on you in pre-school. I knew I wasn't crazy. That was you. That was really stupid. Man, shut up! Shit. Excuse me? Huh? I said shut up to all them haters. And, uh, give me your number. Okay. So, you should give me a call sometime. And maybe we can write a song together. Yeah. I'd like that. Fuck you, niggas. How you do that shit?

Langston, can I use your phone to call Anastacia? Why don't you call at your crib? Well, we don't have a house phone. All we got is my mom's pager. Besides, I need the moral support from my guys, you know? I'm mad nervous, y'all. For sure. Call her. And I'm gonna call George Kush and light up this blunt. You know what? I can't believe they beat my record. You know I hold the record for most videos retired on 106... - And this one is smashing it. - How many days it's been over? Cut it! 78 days! Hello! Yo, it's Jason. Who the hell is Jason? What do you want with my daughter? Hey, sir, it's Jason and I want to speak with Anastacia, sir. Man, you didn't answer my question. Who are you?

Hey, Anastacia. Jason? Yeah. I thought this was your cell phone. I lost my cell phone. This is my home phone. What's up? Uh, nothing. What's up with you? Hey, yo, tell her to put the phone up to her coochie! Shut up! Excuse me? Uh... Nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing. Um... I guess I'll see you later on at the lock-in. Later on. I guess so.

I told you about them Mexican daddies, man. No niggers in mi casa, fool! Confidence, bro. That's all it is. Stop being so fuckin' nervous. Yeah, virgin! Who was that on the phone? Nobody. It was just a friend from school. He was helping me with homework. Oh, yeah? He's helping you out. And your little friend from school. Is he a negrito? What does it matter? Orale, Kim Kardashian? Now you're dating black guys? Papa! Papa? Don't papa me. Okay, I know how suave black guys are. They talk to you with that Mack Daddy lingo, holding their giant penises. All right, and I could tell by this kid's voice, over the phone, it was all deep, he's got a giant palo. No, he doesn't. What did you say? Nothing. Look, Ana, you're a beautiful Latina, which means... Which means what? Which means you're fertile as hell. I don't want some little black nappy-headed baby with a big penis running around this house, touching all my shit, and leaving him for me to raise. I can't believe we're talking... Big black baby. ...about this right now. I'm a virgin. I didn't run off like you and Mom and get pregnant when I was 16. All right, well, at least I stuck around to take care of my children. Those black guys come around with their cool talk and they get you in bed, and when you get pregnant, they turn into magicians. Magicians? Yeah, magicians, like that acho we saw at the casino, David Coppertone. - Yeah, Coppertone. - He was good. - Yeah, it was funny. - The rabbits? Yeah, they were cute. They disappear. I don't want you to become a statistic. All right? I'm telling you because I want you to take care of yourself. I care about you. Papa, don't worry about me. Worry about your sons. Like Junior, the one that just got out of jail? Or this one. The 18-year-old who still wears slippers because he doesn't know how to tie his shoes. Hmm? Oh, no, I know how to tie my shoes. I just think the concept of laces is stupid. I would have to agree with Flaco on that one. Who asked you to talk, ese, and why are you always here? Yeah. Why are you always here? What do you mean? I'm family. How are you family, fool? Yeah. How are you family, fool? I'm second cousin to your third cousin's cunado, El Machete, who married Consuela, who was married to Pablo before and then escaped to the US. After that, El Machete took care of me, and then he disappeared. So, I didn't know what to do. So I just came here. And that's all I have to say about that. And you want me to be with somebody like this? Gosh, Papa. Shit, she might have a point. Power 106! DJ Sully Sal. The moment you've been waiting for is going down. We're gonna lock your asses in.
