Im hung-over.. With love.. waiting. How should I be, o restless heart? My restless heart, please tell me. Im drunk.. Im hung-over. How could I have known? You simply disappeared. I changed my house. Did you change your relationships too? You werent around when I needed a friend. You didnt get married again? I couldnt find you. Or I wouldve married you. Rahul. - Anjali. We live once, die once.. ..even marry once. And we fall in love.. - just once. Congratulations Kamal! Your daughters getting married. - Thank you. Quiet. Stop this nonsense. She isnt dead. Shes getting married. Tandoori Nights. Play that one. Why havent you put the flowers in Abhays room. Come on, do it fast. Aaliya! I know you hate sentimental stuff. Too bad. Here goes.. Grandma gave me this ring.. For her daughter-in-law.. For you! What a crappy dialogue, Gulati! Grandmas ring? You serious? Aaliya, grandma and grandpa eloped.. .. Even though no one had a problem with their relationship. The history of this ring is very dramatic. Al.. I love you. So? Does that mean we should get married? Why are love and marriage the same thing? I mean, heres a perfectly nice thing. Love. Now lets destroy it.. Piece by piece. Because if we dont get married.. .. what will PEOPLE say? Al, you think I wanna marry you cos of social pressure? I want to get married for us. For you and me. I know whats gotten into you. Your sisters wedding trumpets have crawled under your skin. Sorry, that cant convince me. How about this? I love how my mornings begin with your voice. Cos you call for something important like.. .. How do I switch on the computer? And I love how passionately you do all four of your jobs. How you come to see me for an hour.. .. after tormenting me for fifteen.. .. just to say Gulati, youre an idiot. Now kiss me. And I love the way you shut your eyes.. .. and enjoy every single bite.. from my plate. And when my clothes smell of you. Your hands on mine.. - Shut up, you idiot. Lets elope right now. And now we wouldve kissed. But that would be weird.. .. cos Id be kissing myself. But, God, I am good. Drag? No! Smoking is bad for girls Really? I thought its bad for anyone. Men dont get pregnant. - Youre pregnant? No. But.. I plan to. Marriage at twenty two. First kid at twenty three. Second kid, three years later. My plan was simpler. Turn twenty and lose my virginity! Thanks for tomorrows headlines. Its a wedding, Al. Please take your chimney away. So your wedding smoke is devotion.. And mine is pollution? Hypocrite! - Come on, Al. And spare me your lecture the cigar is for my play. I have to look convincing! But why are you rehearsing when you are a smoker? Hang on! A play? - Street play. Which means aunty Ayesha definitely doesnt know about it. Nope, cos shell freak out.. .. the minute she hears the word acting. Its just one show. At Pragati Maidan. No one will ever know. But you do. Just tell aunty and end the lies. Stop compromising. The amount you act in real life.. - Less than you. Born in his Papas theatre.. .. and numbed to death by its boredom. Thanks for your wisdom and sensitivity. Screw sensitivity! Uncle Jeets theatre business will be fine without you. This is the Nth time. - What? Whenever I point out your problem.. .. you turn the spotlight on me. But you started.. - But.. Since you wont focus on your problem.. .. without discussing mine, lets focus on me. Lets say I tell dad Im not interested in his business. Lets say he doesnt get multiple cardiac arrests from this news. What will I do then? - Thats the best part. Youll find out, Gulati. Lets travel. Lets be nomads. Is this honeymoon ever going to end? - Aunt Pammi. When are you getting married? Were thinking about it. - Not thought about it. Tell your babe that if she continues like this.. ..shell stay single like me. - Dont beat her. If youre so desperate, why dont you marry? - Rude! Im ahead of you by three divorces. Cant help a quirky destiny. Destiny is never quirky. People are. But arent quirky people the most fun? Cigarette packets come with a warning, people dont. Doesnt stop you from smoking, does it? Wow. So put your money where your mouth is the altars ready. Get married. Look, Ayesha is here as well. Your mother still looks stunning. See how she still affects people. Here comes the superstar! Still thinks shes a superstar. See how their tails start wagging. She still looks a million bucks. Hi, Aunty. - Hi, dear. I love your sari. But where is Aaliya? Must be up to her usual tricks somewhere. Oh no! Whats the rush? - Cant you smell it? This henna smells so bad its affecting my brains. Girls look happy with henna on their hands.. .. cos theyre actually high on this dung. Yonks ago if a lassie had not this shite in her fair hands.. .. a laddie could carry her away. Henna marked a woman betrothed. What say thee? Shall I abduct ye? Whos stopping you? Or will ye need steroids? Youve got competition. The maiden is mine. Lower ye eyes. Shes your sister. Sis left. They couldve done a court-marriage. Why are weddings such a circus? Dumped another thing on her. She looks like a clothes shop. Shes smiling. Shes smiling. Some coma patients also smile, stupid.. .. doesnt mean theyre happy. Shes smiling cos no one knows Jai is holding her hands. They are celebrating the biggest day of their lives.. ..with the most important people in their lives. I cant see anyone important here. Im here for the free food. The men are here for the free whiskey. And the women are missing their TV serials. Stupid. There wont be a repeat telecast of my sisters wedding. And happiness grows only when you share it. Say that dialogue again. Happiness grows only when you share it. Like a wild river.. .. she ripples without a care. Like a gentle stream .. .. he lets his silences sing. Her fiery sands sting his feet.. .. like sunshine tickles rainy days. You, my dear, are lost without me.. .. and Im incomplete without you. You, my dear, are lost without me.. .. and Im incomplete without you. I love you, Gelato. - Hello, baby. Another fight? Another slap? Sorry, baby. - Kiss me, baby. Sorry, baby! Kiss me, baby! Buzz off! Bye. There are many ways to die, Al. Then lets try this. Well die together. She melts clouds in her hands.. .. and fills still nights with laughter. She melts clouds in her hands.. .. and fills still nights with laughter. So fearless, carefree and thirsty for life.. .. Im helpless with her and without. Are you a character from Saas-Bahu (a popular genre on TV) serials? Its sign of respect Al.. that comes from the heart. Then I should take the blessings of any elder. Hello, Uncle. - Bless you. I hope you two get married soon. Happy Diwali, sir! So dont do it. Its not an obligation. I do it cos it makes ma and papa happy. And that makes me happy. If it made someone happy, wouldnt you.. - Suffer spondylitis? No way! Whats wrong with your family? One cigarette, please. Im sorry were so normal. And not as cool as you! Perhaps we should all start smoking cos thats so rebellious. Thats it. Al.. - Screw you, Gulati. Superb idea! He opens vials of perfumes in her heart.. Ive searched for love high and low.. .. and looks for love-filled shells on sandy shores He opens vials of perfumes in her heart.. Ive searched for love high and low.. .. and looks for love-filled shells on sandy shores He fills his world with love.. The closeness of hearts, the streams of desires. .. as she fills hers with dreams. He was not flirting with me. Yes, he was. Trust me, I am a guy. - Youre jealous. Youre blind. - What? Cant a boy and a girl.. A boy and a girl cant be just good friends. So if we break-up we cant be friends. Nope. God, youre such an old-fashioned.. .. almost chauvinistic.. - Youre an idiot. I cant believe I am with you. I am sexy. You, my dear, are lost without me.. .. and Im incomplete without you. Like a wild river.. .. she ripples without a care. Like a gentle stream .. .. he lets his silences sing. Her fiery sands sting his feet.. .. like sunshine tickles rainy days. You, my dear, are lost without me.. .. like Im incomplete without you. You, my dear, are lost without me.. .. like Im incomplete without you. You, my dear, are lost without me.. .. like Im incomplete without you. I am Shah Rukh Khan. This is probably the most disturbing thing you ever said to me. I am a star in every scene of my life. Okay. What if you fail to become an actor? Lying to your mother.. Everythings going to change Gelati. Gulato? Whats your name? - Sunita. Sunita! I have a sexy plan, Sunita. But Ill tell you later cos I dont want to lose the high. Oh God! Another plan! Sunita, youre so cute.. - What? Stress makes you look cuter. Oh God! Another plan! Im okay. Youre my stud, Sunita. You can handle anything. And you take advantage of that. Dont say that. You know Im nonsense person. Understand, Sunita. - Why? Why should I understand? Who argues? - Me. Who is stupid? - Me. Who is impulsive? - Me, Your Honour, me. Then why should I understand? Who is older? You! Who is mature? You! Who is understanding? You! Who is sensible? You. So its all up to you, Sunita. Youve to handle everything. Because if you let go.. You complete me. Shah Rukh, please! I am the kite and youre my bread. - Thread. I fly and you let me go higher.. But as soon as you sense danger.. .. you pull me back. What if the thread breaks? Dont say that. Ask the Thread Maintenance Department to look after it. It cant break, it cant break. - Ill talk to them. Promise? - I promise. Cos I love flying a lot.. I cant help it. - Ive noticed. You know, Im a USA. UFO. - I know. Same thing. So youll stick around, right? You wont let us drift apart. Say it.. ! Sunita, where are you taking me? - To bed. I will never let us break. I promise. Hello. - Ayesha has started her classic emotional blackmail. So much melodrama.. It was a long shot. | Didnt think Id get in. Al, calm down Shes so unreasonable. Shes been gone into sentimental Overdrive. Al, are you nuts? This is an office. If she wasnt my mother, I wouldve left home. Shut up! This is an office. People work here! Its a loo actually. What happened? Good news, Ive got admission here. Bad news, Ayesha has flatly refused my going to Gold Coast. Just a sec! Youre going to Australia? Obviously not. I want to, but Ayesha wont let me go. When did you apply? Three months ago. It was a long shot. Didnt think Id get in. Thought Id tell you both about it.. - From the airport? Abhay, I am already quite tense I dont need your senti-crap now! And I dont need two moms. I am getting sentimental? Its a one year course.. .. in another country without telling anyone.. .. and this is your good news? Youre unbelievable. I didnt tell you cos I knew you would react like this.. Theres a difference between a plan and a decision. If this was so important for you why didnt you tell me before? Why are you all so bloody emotional? Gelato, understand! Thought Id surprise you guys once the scholarship comes in. I didnt think mom would react badly to a Communications course. And me? I shouldnt react either? I know. Im sorry. I knew youd freak out, and so.. I freak out cos Im always.. .. competing with your lists and plans. Where do I fit in your life, Aaliya? Where do you fit in your own life? Dont like what youre doing. Dont know what you want to do. And youve the nerve to tell me that I shouldnt follow my dreams. Youre doing it again! Instead of pointing out my flaws.. .. focus on your actions, for a change. Im trying to. You wouldnt be angry if you understood focus! Youre a boring executive in your dads office.. ..who doesnt even know himself.. ..and youre okay with it! Where is the fire, Abhay? What do you want? I dont know. But Im not scared to admit this truth. Unlike you. Whos only solution to problems is lying! Because you cant hear the truth, Abhay. Youre too scared! Try me, Al. - Fine. You dont have a life. I am your life. Your life shouldnt be disturbed, and to hell with mine! Im not your love. Im your habit! Youre actually defending this? Youre lying and telling me I dont really love you? Youre pathetic. - And youre delusional! Youve decided to go to Australia.. So your mom and I should just deal with it! To hell with our feelings. - What about my feelings? You dont have any. Youre just a selfish programmed robot. You couldnt communicate with two people.. .. and you want to do Mass Communications. So you think hes unambitious, unhappy.. .. and lacks focus. And his problem is that youre.. .. over-ambitious, you focus on everything.. .. except him. And you know what? I see his point. You two should seriously get married! What a pair! Youre casually joking about this cos you know.. .. how committed he is towards you. No matter what, he will still love you. I need some space from that love. - Bravo. Spoken like your dads daughter! Dad cheated on you, ma! And what did you do? Lied to me, as usual. For what, Aunty? A silly course. A year long course. Stop whining! Telling you late is not lying! Shes no saint but shes independent. So let her be. Why does it bother you? Why cook for an army over this? Aaliya is independent, adventurous.. .. wants to experience everything. And I love that about her. But thats whats throwing me out of her life. And shes okay with that. Whats wrong with that? I want to travel. See the world. Live on my own, free as a bird. Are we threatening your freedom? Buddy boy, go or not.. If shes even thinking about going.. .. one things for sure. Are you breaking up with him? She wants to act! And Acting is the most popular course of that college. Im sure you noticed that. This is just an excuse to get out of here. When Aaliya was six.. .. she convinced her teacher that she couldnt do homework As her actress mom couldnt pack her lunch-box.. .. and Aaliya had to do all her chores herself. Just to escape homework! You know what? If I was Aaliyas teacher.. .. Id have bought the story as well. Aaliya is that good. These small lies are just a rehearsal to become an actress. She thinks its fun. Who knows what she might do in Australia? She hasnt seen the real, ugly side of this world.. .. which I have. I was married to it. There are all sorts of people in this world.. .. notjust ones like Als dad. She will make mistakes. And she has a right to. How else will your stubborn daughter learn? The blemish is inside, not on it. Let it be. Thats what makes it unique! Aunty has one condition. Only Communications. No acting. Al. Im doing a boring job in my dads office.. But Im not lying to myself. I know. Im sorry. But.. - I know. I dont want to lose myself either. Take a risk, Gulati. Youre the smartest guy I know. If you stay so safe.. - You balance that.. .. Risk-taker! Youre even risking us. Are you mad? What risk! Arent we still together after yesterdays record-breaking fight. A years break wont make any difference. What break? Dont be an idiot. Being apart for a year is an obvious break! Al, one doesnt apply for casual leave in a relationship! Are you breaking up with me? No, you sentimental freak! Dont complicate it. This is not a break-up, this is just a little.. break. What does a little break mean, Al? Think before you answer. Do you know what a little break is? No, but I know that we need it. We need to find ourselves. I just hope we dont lose each other while finding ourselves. We wont. You wont let it happen. Dont lose hope, Gulati. What are you thinking? Its time to fax the Thread Maintenance Dept. Dont lie, I know youre missing no one. Met your aunt yet? - No, but shes lived in Oz for twenty years. Besides, moms sister is bound to be cool. Ayesha first spoiled you and now shes regretting it. Had you come to me earlier she wouldnt be ruing this day. Whats wrong with this day? You dont like Tuesdays? No boys, no late-nights. And no phone calls after eleven. What? I need to pee. Shall I hold or wait? And finally a whiff of fresh air.. .. as our bound arms stretch themselves. My heart wants to hum.. While he wants to sing.. I smile, he giggles.. .. powerless against this crazy whim. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. She said my skirts too short! Change it. Imagine! Even Ayesha never said this to me! But why are we discussing her? - Thank you. The kids were missing you today. -Who? The kids we meet at the signal, Al! Youve forgotten them already? - Dont be silly. Hey, if I murder my aunt.. .. where should I hide her body? -Al, please. Can we please talk about something else? I have to live with her, Gulati! -So do I. Gelato, guess what? Your aunt is wearing a bikini and head banging in the campus. I was not talking about her. Sometimes youre more irritating than my aunt! And were back to your aunt! Alright. Well talk about aunt only. Such intimacy sows seeds of distances.. .. dont be fooled, these waters are not sweet. Look but dont touch; its fire.. ..just watch it shimmer from afar.. ..any closer and you could burn.. ..powerless against this crazy whim. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. - Hi, guys. Hi, Im Rishabh. - Hi, Aaliya. You were really good today. - Thanks. God, my aunt. Gotta go, guys. Its 10 O clock. She couldve called me. I dont know what to do with her. She just walked in. Ayesha, I agreed to house my niece, not to become part of local gossip! She thinks its ok to be wild cos this is Australia! Has no respect for elders. Its called survival, Gelato. So what? This isnt India, its Australia. Its a bench in Australia. Sounds really adventurous. Look, dad has a partner in Melbourne.. Ah! So I should leave one dictatorship and.. ..enter another rulebook! Know what? Why dont I just come back home? Why explore the world, right? Please dont do that. Who will do the other courses in the world? Like the one in Switzerland, on Snow Management. Screw you! Weve been arguing for over two months! Im sick of this shit! Im.. sorry, I dont want to fight. I just want to help you. Lets not talk for a few days, ok? How will that help, Al? If we dont hear each others voices.. ..well have very little left? No, Gulati. Itll make us stronger. Ok. Lets try this as well. But youre a nonsense person. Bye, sweety. I love you, sweety. Ive never felt so pathetically poor. Who can afford 200 dollars a month? Im screwed, man. Hey, I have an idea! You can stay where I live if you pay advance rent. Six hundred for six months. Sorted! What? - Yup. Thats awesome. Thank you. Did you leave this pink toothbrush in my bathroom? What? - I did. Good. Come. Last night was sensational. - Deja vouz! Thats yours. Thats the way. Dont call. Ill call or not. Were there the two of you last night? - No, Im.. No one cares who you are. Get out. - Excuse me? Are you dumb and deaf? No one gives a shit who you are! She needs to take a shit! But.. -Why arent you at the shack? I wasnt in the mood. Im in the mood to cut your wage. -Just a sec.. You cant cut your elder brothers pay. Bite me! You work for me. I own that shack! Dont make me angry, Cyrus. Youre Cyrus? Is this your house? Wow! Ms. India has brains too. Shes not your type. And you - thats called a door.. .. and if you lift those two, you might discover walking. Excuse me. Or we can do something else with them. - What? This is not a freaking motel, Cy! Thanks, that was butt ugly. Freaks, Im Aaliya.. Rishabh sent me here. - Aaliya. Why didnt you say that earlier? He finally got a hot babe. We were expecting you.. - Im not his babe. Sorry about the confusion.. got the rent? 600 dollars. - Are you single? What? - Youll need to learn to ignore my brother. Can I feel that butt? Ive handled bigger sleazes in Delhi buses. Youre nothing. Nads. - Yes. Whats a sleazoid? Oh, by the way. I am Nadia. Hi. - This feels good. Spank me while youre at it. Our house. The beach bed. Our beach shack. Where we rent out surfboards. Cyrus! My real talents emerge at the bar! Nadia likes pain. And your room. If you need anything.. dont tell me. Its perfect. Distances are important too.. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too.. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too.. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Let me see. Why dont you just tell your parents you dont want to get married. You dont know them. Its easier to get married. No, its easier to get laid. Lets Party, you losers! - Party! Gelato! ! - How are you? Thirty days and thirty hours. Not bad, huh! Cant hear a thing, hang on.. Move your ass! Id love to, but.. whos dying behind you? Its Cyrus. Hes nuts! Im in an amazing place. My room is sea-facing! Im living in a private island.. for just six hundred dollars! Thats.. cheap, right? -Super cheap. And for six months. Six hundred for six months? Sounds too good to be true, Al. You doubt so much, Gelato. Why so serious? Whys everyone screaming, What kind of a party is this? Its unbelievably crazy! Weve been partying for two days. Its Rishabs farewell party and everyones smashed! Enough about me. How are you? Same shit, different day! Whos Rishab? A sexy stud! Happy? Were all friends and live together. Chill, Al. I havent heard your voice for a month. Youve made new friends. Lets get naked! Who.. hate their clothes, New place, new friends. Its natural, Gulati. Dont assume what you cant see is shady! Know what? I dont want to argue. You want me to understand your life after you throw me out of it? What are you doing, Al? Why are you fighting ? Im taking a break. Hello? Damn! Look, fighting will not help anything.. Buddy.. Youre in a long queue here! Youre in queue! I just need.. a break. Six in the evening? What the.. Thank God for small mercies! O what a beautiful.. Hello! ! Congratulations! - On? On finally getting some action. - What? Look at her, dude. She has more facial hair than Rishab. Why do you think he brought you here? For some lurve. Just wanted a piece of heaven.. .. before he spent the rest of his life in hell! You asshole! Get up. I thought you were a friend.. Ill cut your.. Into so many pieces.. .. youll never be able to have sex Hang on. - Shut up. Listen.. - How could you even think about.. Im going to kill you.. ! - What happened? Gulati, what the hell are you doing here? Looked cute, so I let him in. - What! Did you touch her? - Hes your boyfriend? Abhay, stop it. Spank him harder. Did you touch her? - I dont remember. What? - You asshole. Dont remember! Theres nothing to remember. - What did he do? Gulati, nothing happened. Whats a Gulati? - I knew something was wrong. Now he would be able to touch any girl again. Hes running away. Stop recording, man! - Come in. This is so going on You Tube. Howd you get here so soon? We just spoke today. We spoke yesterday, Al. And five minutes later, a drunk man picked up your phone .. .. and told me to get in line. But I told you to back-off. Why call in the first place? Why cant you deal with this break? Break doesnt mean.. And what the hell does a break mean anyway? It means shes dumped you! ! I was so hoping you wouldnt feel insecure. Dont help me. Dont discuss my problems.Dont call me. You have a problem with everything. Your only response is fear. You do that to people, Al. Your mom found out two days later that youre not at your aunts. She was so freaked out. - Dont drag Ayesha into this. She didnt come running here. Cos I keep telling her to trust you. Since you got here.. - Dont start. Youre here cos youve got issues. We have issues, Al. Youre so blinded by your dreams.. I dont want to deal with your problems. This is it. - You dont want to deal with our problems. Youre not taking a break, youre running away. I am breaking up with you. You dont mean that. I do. I cant do this anymore. One little problem and you throw it all away? Thats your quick fix? And so easy for you to do? Its become so complicated that nothing else can be done. Its not complicated, its just inconvenient for you. You dont want it, right? Fine. But I wont accept it. Were not over just because you say its over. Just let it go, Abhay! We cant be over when you snap your fingers. Relationships are built by togetherness, not space! Your priorities have changed, not mine. We will fix this. Until you come back to your senses.. .. and listen carefully for I mean every word.. Im NOT going anywhere! Im staying right here. Youve lost it, Abhay. And what do you mean by here? Where will you stay? - Stay here, dude. What? - What? I like you. - Really? Nads, I got here first, Ive paid advance rent. Not in a man-love way. I just.. like you!, He aint leavingjust cos you say so. So chill. Whens your flight? - Tomorrow. And we dont want you to miss it. So you can spend the night at the airport. But.. - What? Advance rent.. ? - Six months, I know. Im Abhay. - Nadia. And I am the retard. No. No, no, no. One second. You and I cant live under the same roof.. Why not? - Because.. - Im your EX-boyfriend, right? Know what? Youre right. Please stay here. But were so through. My stuff? Ill take it later. Lose unwanted weight. Make your body look attractive. Pick up the phone and order now. Telemalls Home Jogger. Either youre really stupid or really blind. Gulati, what the hell are you doing here? One day, I gave a girl my word.. .. that I will never let us break apart. And I intend to keep my word. Say goodbye to obesity, but not us. We will return with this unique invention.. .. after a short break! Youre up early! Whats the time there? Eight in the morning. Thats funny, even here..

She doesnt even believe in love. I believe in respect. Screw love. Well done!. Last one. Dude! Such a cruel thirst, I see but not sip this water.. ..I live my dreams in such a cruel reality. A strange possibilities, they open a window.. ..only to cast a stranger view! Yes, hes sweet! Should I make a candy out of him? This drama has gone on for two months! Breaking up was easier. Nothings difficult, aunty. Shes just a bit miffed. But I have a plan. See each others point of view instead of fighting. Im trying to do that. Thats what Im doing, - No, not you, son. Stop yelling, Aaliya. Im not yelling. Im trying to make him see.. - Thats it.. ..its a pointless fight. I dont know what he wants. - I know what she wants. Get off the phone. Whats your problem, Whyre you calling Ayesha? Shes my mom. My mom, my life, my house, my.. ..and your room too. Hello! What are you doing here? Im taking a RISK. Didnt you say people could never be friends after a break-up? Correct. But this is a break-up only for you. For me its.. - A challenge! How can this happen to me? Ive even chosen our kids names! Babies? Nonsense! I know the responsibility of world population.. ..lies on your delicate shoulders. Well plant trees! And now she walks away to lead her secret life.. ..so dont forget your script! Al.. - Dont. Extra rent for babies and trees! The ocean has erased our footprints.. ..and a stray breeze sprinkles nostalgia over me. Strangeness is all around.. ..its raining moon and stars.

And now I get a damn International film in Oz of all the places. This doesnt even happen in films. What do I do now? Speak, Gelato. Follow the beat of your heart! - Meaning? Why are love and happiness different things for people? You were right, you were my life. Not that again.. Hear me out, Al. I was insecure cos I didnt know how someone could be.. ..so passionate about their dreams. But I do now. I stood between you and your dream. I made you choose. Thats not love. Thats selfishness. Aunty Ayesha will understand. Like me. I didnt celebrate your admission, did I? Lets do it now. Lets get a beer. Actually.. Lets celebrate you first. Why? Cos you found your dream, Gulati. For the first time you look happy working. You always looked good in an apron! Did you tell your dad? Im following the beat of my heart. Hell understand too. Chef Ramsay! I missed you. My only friend in the world! So the vixen is softening. Shes bound to. If a boy crosses seven seas to woo her, any girl would melt! Its too loose! - Get her some boobs! When are you coming back? I dont know, Aunty. But I will return with Aaliya. No, Nads, were just friends. Finally we are un-complicated. Love, relationships, hurt.. ..one should leave these for old-age. Its too much. Shut up, Cyrus. Actually, youre a genius. Its simple. Love was getting complicated, so you broke up. Then you felt all alone.. ..and became friends again. Perfect! - Exactly. And Abhay thinks hes.. - An ATM machine. He gets no deposits, you get to make withdrawals.. ..of his heart, mind or time.. And the best part? Machines dont expect anything back. Youre being sarcastic, right? And this is why youre a genius. I love you. Its so difficult to spend days and nights. Theres just one thing I want to say to you. Shes smoking! Gulati wanted to marry her when he grew up. I was ten, guys. Hey, are you coming on the 10th for my graduation? Okay, good news! My new restaurant.. Our restaurant! Our new restaurant has found an investor! Bad news! Meetings on the 10th. - Gulati. Didnt tell you cos I knew youd freak out! Dont friends fit into your plans anymore? Not fair! You used to make time for me earlier. Not fair! Yes, Ive packed the pickles. Hang up and save your money. Youre arrivingjust a day before my graduation. Abhay and Cyrus have a meeting. Nadia has to manage the Shack. Nobody loves me. Why couldnt you come earlier? I need to discuss an important thing. What happened? Well talk face to face. Its kind of big. Your big is usually a big bomb. You know I dont like surprises. But.. - Aaliya Khan. Just a second. Gotta run, ma. Bye. Nervous? - Not at all. Good, cos you can nail it. Thats what Im nervous about. And now weve reached the end of another academic year Congratulations, class of 2009. You are all now graduates. Thats it Ayesha. No more courses. Im fed up of studying. Thank God! So whats your big surprise? Youve kept me in suspense since yesterday. Yes, I.. Gulati! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Have you told her yet? Im shitting bricks! Dont worry, youll be fine. You know how she is.. -Yes. Dont give her less credit than she deserves. Hey.. Ill be right here waiting for you! Chill! Its just an offer.. ..its not like youve signed a contract. Al..! - So thats your big surprise. Congratulations, aunty. Congratulations to you too. Im happier about this than your graduation. I knew it. This break-up wouldnt last long. But how did this happen? And please dont take an eternity again.. ..get married soon. Marriage? Where did that come from? Even Abhays managed to move on. Aaliya. Abhay, tell her that were just friends. Were just friends. Gelato, are you..? Were just friends. So what was your news? What was the surprise? Mother, I.. Promises, commitments, feelings.. ..these things mean nothing to you. Dont pretend to ask after youve signed the contract. I dont mind your having dreams.. ..but I mind that our feelings are nothing but hurdles in your path. People dont love you because youre special Aaliya. Youre special because a few people in this world love you immensely. Sometimes, despite the way you are. And today you proved how foolish they are! I didnt want this. I just.. - You cant expect everything.. .. and not expect to get hurt. Im sorry. I didnt want to hurt you. When we broke up, I refused to accept it as a possibility. I didnt believe you. That was my fault. You did move on. Youre lucky you can. Goodbye! - Gulati? Im off. Rain.. It will wash it all away. Lit up, youll see it, a whole new way. Slowly, yesterday will ebb away.. Slowly, making way for a new day. Like a roof of sunlight.. Like a slip-sliding road.. This is but a gentle detour on my way. Like a roof of sunlight.. Like a slip-sliding road.. This is but a gentle detour on my way. If you believe, sun is shining, love is lighting your way. Im sorry. And thanks for everything. Drops of realisation trickle down on me.. Im haunted by a thirst from before.. But I see new clouds dancing above.. ..kissing my forehead, with drops of love. Letting go.. it is time, I know. Seasons have changed in a burst. I take a small step, perhaps my first. Like a roof of sunlight.. Like a slip-sliding road.. This is but a gentle detour on my way. This is but a gentle detour on my way. I didnt choose my dream, ma.. ..it chose me. But I will not lose you for it. I will walk towards but only with you beside me.. And if you arent ready to stand by my side.. ..then Ill wait. But I wont do this without you. I wont leave you alone like dad. I am so sorry, Aaliya. Your dream wasnt wrong, dear. Your means were callous. How much dough do you need for the kitchen expansion? Wow, did we make a profit? - Buzz off. Nice. Now Cyrus will go on a holiday.. .. after which you will expand the kitchen. No one will touch this money. Were going to open a new restaurant. The Investors loved our restaurant plan. The paperwork will be done tomorrow. Are you serious? We got funding? Does that mean I can now.. - No, Cy. I hate you guys. Absolutely. It was my idea to open an Indian restaurant. - Hi, Cy. Here is my partner. Gelato Gulati. Congratulations, man! Houseful on the first day itself. - Thanks, man. No free drinks. Abhay. Nice place. Abhay, had I known youre so talented.. ..Id have thrown you out years ago. Im sorry, Papa. I didnt tell you earlier cos even I didnt know.. Abhay, my dream wasnt that youll learn to manage my theatre.. ..but that youll learn to manage your life. My dreams come true. Youre finally on your feet.. ..earning as well. So you and Aaliya.. No, Papa. We wont discuss that. That topic is closed, please. Fine, lets talk about something else. Why.. dont you get married? Shes cute. And shell turn eighteen soon. Happiness hung from a branch so elusive.. ..but I leaped and caught its fragrance. So fragile, but we inevitably slipped.. ..but I will heal, I will rewrite my script! I can see the shore, I see the light.. ..new stars wink at me from the sky! The flights day after tomorrow. Next Monday flight to Gold Coast. By the time I realized that my parents are right.. ..my own daughter was standing in front of me telling me I was wrong! I was trying to protect you from making the mistakes I had made. But I forgot.. youre not like me. Youre much stronger. Still have a knack for dialogues! Whyd you quit acting? Go back, Aaliya. Follow your heart. Like a roof of sunlight.. Like a slip-sliding road.. This is but a gentle detour on my way. Like a roof of sunlight.. Like a slip-sliding road.. This is but a gentle detour on my way. Like a roof of sunlight.. Like a slip-sliding road.. This is but a gentle detour on my way. Like a roof of sunlight.. Like a slip-sliding road.. This is but a gentle detour on my way. Like a roof of sunlight.. Like a slip-sliding road.. This is but a gentle detour on my way. Come on, Aunt Pammi. You know Im not interested in marriage. So why should I meet any more girls? Cos thats the only way! Just meet them, then say no! Oh, please.. Is this seat taken? Are you meeting a girl? A beautiful babe. Can I go now? - Dont ever call me that. She sounds like a vixen too. Bye aunty! I cant believe the restaurants completed a year. Happy anniversary. - Yes, whatever. Everything began in this shack. Thanks.. I owe you guys everything, or Id still be rotting at the taxi stand.. ..and Cyrus would be rotting in a beer can. Were even! No one owes shit! A toast..! To Cyrus..! Who achieved nothing in life, till today! This restaurant is my first.. - And sole! And soul milestone. Well done, Cyrus. Cheers! Whats a soul? What you can only hope for. Surprise! - Surprise! Shes shooting a film here. Aunty Ayesha agreed. Why dredge up whats over.. - Just a minute. Have you been on a single date after your break-up? This isnt over yet. Hi. Hey. I told Nads that maybe I shouldnt.. - Its fine. How are you? Im good. Thank you. Lets end this awkwardness, Im not good at it. I just came to say.. - Al, its fine. No, let me say it. I just came to say that.. - Al, chill. Im glad youre here. Gulati, I need to say this! I just want to say that Im really happy for you.. Im very proud of you and.. ..Im sorry. Im really very sorry. I didnt mean to hurt you. So how many restaurants do you own now? Two and a half! Two in Gold Coast and one in papas theatre. Wow! So you finally told him. He must be so proud of you. Last years been so hectic.. - One year and forty days! When did your memory improve? I remember everything. - Really? I was thinking on the flight.. ..when we first met in class.. - In the theatre. Who wouldve imagined that we would kiss while watching DDLJ Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. And then date for eight years. Eight years and nine months. Thanks for shitting on my nostalgia! We were watching Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. In fact, for the third time. We had memorized the dialogues.. ..but you were saying them with all your heart. While Shahrukhs monologues kept going.. .. your horrific impersonation got scarier. I had a thumping headache! But I kept saying them dialogues.. ..so you wouldnt notice that I was only watching you! And your perfume was driving me wild. Maybe that caused the headache. I think it was Lily. To end your blabbering, I suggested going home.. ..and watching some more Shahrukh films. And something happened to you. You just leaned over and kissed me, and said.. No one I know has endured so much pain for me! Lavender! The perfume was lavender. Nice place, Gulati. If you hadnt come here Id still be decaying in Delhi! I wouldve never dared to step out. So.. thank you. I came here to look for you.. and found myself. Say that dialogue again! Seeing anyone? - Yes. Mr. Kunzrus daughter. Mr. Agarwals niece from New York. Mrs. Srivastavs almost legal niece. Preetis gynecologists neighbors step-daughter.. ..who is also a gynecologist. And both daughters of Mr. Wanchoo! Dont ask, Al. Im going to India tomorrow for Preetis baby shower. Theyre going to pounce on me like a pack of hungry wolves! Preetis preggers? - Dont start. No. Thats.. great! What happened? Dont resist it, Gulati. Resist what? Marriage. Any girl would be lucky to get your love. And you? Are you happy? I am learning to be happy. You got what you wanted. Yes, but.. Breaking things comes easily to me, Gulati. I nearly lost my mom as well. All my life I wanted to be like her.. ..but turned out exactly like my dad! I even broke us! Maybe.. Im not meant for love. I dont want to deal with your problems, Abhay. This is it, Im breaking up with you. Ayesha, even Abhay has managed to move on. When we broke up, I refused to accept it as a possibility. I didnt believe you. That was my mistake. Dont resist it, Gulati. Resist what? - Marriage. Breaking things comes easily to me. I even broke us. Maybe Im not meant for love. I thought that I understood love. But now.. I dont know anything. I dont know what love is. If you dont take her off your wall.. ..how will you get her out of your heart? The girl you eventually marry.. - I cant fall in love again! These damn Bollywood remakes of Devdas have ruined childrens minds! Alas! She dumped me! I dedicate my life to scuba diving in cheap whiskey! Nothing sexy about that guy! Aunty, I am not like you. - Thats the problem. What if one was to leap from here? Theyd risk a few fractures, brain hemorrhage and.. And thats the difference between you and me, I married thrice. I broke my head, suffered fractures.. ..survived brain hemorrhage as well. And Im ready to leap again! Why? Because no matter how much it hurt.. ..I never let myself be scared. You have to be fearless, Abhay. Or youll end up sharing others happiness, in their weddings. Love is inside you, dear. Take your heart out of its shock-proof padding.. ..and let it do its job! These tiny shocks cant hurt it! And if you wanted to play so safe.. ..whyd you fall in love even the first time? You kids.. ..you cant want everything and expect to not get a little hurt! Its drizzling in my thoughts.. Everything will be washed. There will be a new ray of hope. All the painful memories will flow away. There will be a new destination. Lets go. Papa. - Yes? What? Have you lost it? Cy, keep it down. Youre on a film set! What about me and our business? Were discussing two more restaurants with the investors. I cant believe Im the responsible one here. I get to behave like this, not you. Abhays getting married. What? Wow. Wow? Thats it? I cant buy my Porsche cos of you. Yeah, whatever. Congratulations.. loser! He told you first? He didnt even call me. And youre upset about that? Yes, I told him to get married, but.. he didnt tell me? Whys he not answering? Chicks are weird. I hope the girls a voluptuous North Indian babe! Not Abhays type. - Cy was talking about himself. I cant believe hes getting married. - And he didnt tell me! Why? After all hes just marrying! But, Ayesha, he didnt even tell me. He will tell you. He must be busy. Why? Whats the point in worrying now? Im not worried. Im happy for him. But he couldve called me. But you broke up with him. So? - So hes moved on. Not to another planet. What the hell..! Are you alright? - Yes. Are you sure? - Are you deaf? No, just rich and single. Al.. Im fine, okay! No, youre in love with Abhay. Ladies and gentleman, the flight from Gold Coast to Delhi.. ..will be now ready for boarding. What will you do after going there? I dont know. You broke up with him. - I know. You think.. - I dont know. Isnt it a little too late? - No. Maybe. I dont know. Just shut up. Chicks are weird. Aaliya, please relax. Hes not answering his phone. Obviously, hes getting married today. Did you try his residence number? So loose? Is this a blouse or a jacket? Im very high. Mummy, butter chicken! Whyre there such few lights? Ive put three thousand already. So double that! Wheres Abhay? Theres no place left. Put them up on my head. Pick up, Pick up.. please pick up. They mustve booked the honeymoon suite by now. Goal! Hi, Aaliya. - Isnt that Abhays ex? Shh.. quiet! Aaliya? Uncle, wheres Abhay? He must be upstairs.. The vixen cometh! - Wheres Abhay? Counting the last moments of bliss in his room. Aaliya..! What are you doing? Look at this! What did I tell you? But it isnt shiny, sir. No, its a damn tubelight. - What? Leave it. But, maam, the wedding.. Drop it.. ..or should I use your scissors on you? Abhay, listen.. God, I look like shit! So do I. Al.. - Shhh! Abhay Gulati. I love you. Your grandma gave you this ring.. ..for your wife. For years it was meant for me. And I ruined it with much effort and diligence.. ..with a little help from you. But thats a minor technicality. You were lost, I was immature.. But the point is that.. ..the girl youre going to marry must be a intelligent, mature person.. She has to be, cos shes marrying you. And Im a crazy, immature, stupid, fool.. ..I have to be, for losing you. But Ive always loved you and I always will.. ..even if marry this girl, who you dont even know. But anyway the point is.. ..even for a second, if you still think you have a choice.. ..then please.. ..choose me. Please. Why? Cos you havent watched Mr. India twenty times with that girl. She doesnt know how awfully you bray when you sing in the loo. How you know the name of every kid on every traffic signal.. ..even though they think youre And.. I dont have any other reason. Ive made up my mind, Al. Is this marriage or vengeance? We spent almost ten years together.. And were friends for ten years before that! Exactly. Really? Just because I turned out to be a total moron.. ..youll marry any random girl? Shes not random. Yes, she is. Who is this.. ..Aaliya? Youre marrying me? Its a typo! No, look! It says Aaliya.. Al..! I dont need a reason to marry you. I promised you no matter how.. ..stupid, immature, mind-blowingly moronically you behave.. ..I wont let go. How could the one who pushed me to be brave.. ..boldly took risks.. ..was the star in her own life.. ..be afraid of herself today? You taught me to be fearless, Al. You cant give up! You made us stronger. And youre not like your dad.. .. or you wouldnt be here today. You are meant for love! By the way.. ..the Thread Maintenance Department has quit! Im into spinning tops now. The suckers stay on the ground! Are you sure? Al. Eighteen years and nine months! For the love of God, yes. Then why are we getting married? Excellent point. We were married in a way! When two people are together for so long, its a marriage! This is pointless! - Exactly. Cos heres a perfectly good thing - Love. Now lets destroy it, piece by piece. Cos if we dont get married Scandal! ! ! Just for a piece of paper thatll tell us what we already know. That we love each other. - Exactly. Or I wouldnt be spending our honeymoon catering on your set! See, true love. This is not sin! So please dont call our kids weird names! What? Hang on. - But we wont have any kids. Exactly.. - We will adopt puppies. Then why didnt we? I hate you, its all your fault. Al, breathe in, breathe out! - I hate you. I know. I love you. I hate this guy. Who the hell are you? Hes our doctor. Dont touch me! How else will he do the delivery? Im talking about you. Please get this thing out of her. Lets do it again. I dont think I can go through the trauma What shit! I endured the trauma. Come on. No. Sarah, mom is leaving you now, okay? Like you left daddy. What? Sarah, mom loves dad so much.. ..that she came back from Australia to be with him. After the break up. It was just a little break. So what does a little break mean Shah Rukh? Oh shut up, Sunita! And finally a whiff of fresh air.. .. as our bound arms stretch themselves. My heart wants to hum.. While he wants to sing.. I smile, he giggles.. .. powerless against this crazy whim. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too. Such intimacy sows seeds of distances.. .. dont be fooled, these waters are not sweet. Look, but dont touch; its fire.. ..just watch it shimmer from afar.. ..any closer and you could burn.. ..powerless against this crazy whim. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too. I am rain and sunshine.. And he is a big bore. Both rain but not together. Lifes easy with some distance. We have our different worlds. We are powerless against this crazy whim. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too. Distances are important too. Sometimes you gotta chase space. Distances are important too.
