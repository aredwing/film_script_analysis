Good afternoon. We're now approaching Santa Clara airport. It's 12:00 p.m... Welcome to Santa Clara! Hi. - You look beautiful. - Thanks, Dad. - So grown up. - You look exactly the same. Look at my granddaughter. Such a beautiful smile. Beautiful brown eyes, just like your mother. I've got brown eyes, too. You're a Harriman. Look at the size of you! We're gonna have to stop you growing up too quick. - How was the flight, Paul? - Oh, it was fine. Welcome to Colombia. You'll have better weather here than in London. Your boxes arrived safely and they're waiting for you at the house. Santa Clara was built around the Aguas Rojas neighborhood. It used to be a fishing village, now it's grown into a town. The fishing has gone. Everyone works in the factory. They're lovely people. Very warm, very hard-working. A little bit young, no? Rules are a little different here. So, Sarah, I have to travel to Sao Paulo next week, which means we have a few intense days ahead of us at the plant. - Great. - Grandpa, what do you do in your factory? We make paper. And your mom is going to work there. - She's going to be the boss. - That's right! And when you grow up, if you're a good girl, you can be the boss, too. Unless you want to be a rock star. Come on! Get out of the road! Hey, can you open the window? Here we are! This is your new home. Come on, sweetie. - What do you think? - It's beautiful. - It's huge. How did you find it? - It belongs to the company. Most executives don't bring their families or they prefer to stay in town. Nobody has lived here for years. So, how is the art world treating you, Paul? You know, it's never gonna make me rich, but it's all right, it's okay. - Oh, you like it? - It's a castle! It is a castle! Here. Hold it there. Gotcha! She looks beautiful! Come here, I want to show you something. A big surprise for you down here. - Well, it definitely doesn't suck. - No, it does not. It's amazing! Don't jump! Thank you, Jordan. This is all very nice. Thank you. It's my pleasure. How do you like Hannah's house? Yeah, it's great. She's going to love it. Thank you. I meant to tell you, the help will be here tomorrow if you need a hand with anything. Okay. Okay. I'm heading off now, but I'll come back tomorrow. Take you into town, if you want to pick up some supplies or... - Okay. - Thanks, Dad. Okay. Bye, Hannah! - Bye, Grandpa! Thank you! - You're welcome! Not sure why, but I thought he was gonna hate me like... a little less in Colombia. Just like a little bit. - He doesn't hate you. - He hates me. - We're going to be happy here. - Of course. Of course, we will. Dad, I can't sleep. This room is too big. - Okay, let's play our game. - Okay. Mermaid. Dream. Mother. Room. Market. Treasure. - Elevator. - Good. Rabbits! - Turtle. - No, no, no. Rabbits. Silver. River. Rock. Kid. Dad. Dark. King. Good. Good night, sweetie. Can you close that? Of course. This is the central market. You can find almost everything you'll need in here. It's especially crowded these days because of the celebration. What's all this about? What are they celebrating? It's called "La Fiesta de los Nios Santos". Why are they putting on those bandages, Grandpa? Are they sick? They're dressing up, honey. Happens every year. They celebrate something that happened a long, long time ago. Well, everything here happened a long time ago. Look at those candy! You like those? What about this one? Or this one? Break out the wallet. We're in deep trouble now, my man. - Yeah, I see it. - How much is this? You get down, I'll get the money. - We got jugs. - Wind chime? I'm good for wind chimes, right this second. Muchas gracias. Sarah, have you got Hannah? - Hannah! - Mummy! - Sweetie, I told you to stay close. - Silver's gone! It's okay, you're fine, you're fine. She's okay. - Just try it. - No. - No? You didn't eat anything today. - I'm not hungry. Hey, kiddo, look at this. I got your favorite dessert here. We got strawberry yogurt, we got bananas, we got some chocolate. What do you think? Two little bites of this, and you get to have all of this. What do you think? I want Silver back. You want Silver back? Well, we've already talked about that. We're going to go look for him tomorrow, okay? A little girl took him. She had a mask on her face. She had a mask on her face? Come here. We're going to go upstairs. Say goodnight to Mommy. Good night, sweetheart. And we're going to try and calm down here. - What do you say about that? - Okay. - I don't like losing my stuff, either. - I didn't lose him. She took him! Okay, okay, a little girl took him, I understand. She was pretty upset there. She's okay now, she's asleep. - She'll be fine. - Yeah. - She'll forget about it. - She will. - You okay? Are you a bit nervous? - I feel like it's the first day of school. You're gonna be great. Come here. I've made a cream cake. Thank you. Would you like me to pour you some tea? Yes, please. With sugar? Yes. - Hey, hey. - Hi. - You all right? - Yes. - Okay, I'm gonna be over there working. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - Would you like some sugar? - No. I've made you a surprise birthday cake. Thank you. I can drink the tea. I can't eat the cake because I'm on a diet. You look sleepy. I can't believe you remembered my birthday. So, I'll give you some cake. It's my specialty. You can have some tea. Yes. Thank you. And... Hannah! Hannah! Silver! Hannah! What are you doing out here, kiddo? Not out of my sight, that's our rule, you know that. - Silver's here! - Come here. Okay. There's nothing there, Hannah. - Anyway, I thought you said someone took him. - But I just saw him. Come on, don't make things up. Besides, everyone knows if you spend too much time alone in the jungle... - you turn into a monkey. - Dad, you're the one making things up. Hi. - Hi. - Hi, Mr. Holden. No, Paul, please. Catalina, right? - Yeah, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - And you must be Hannah, right? - Hi. Hi. I brought these for you. Do you like stickers? She wants to say thank you. Say thank you, buddy. - Thank you. - There you go. - You're welcome. - Would you like to look at my toys? - Sure. - I'll go grab us some lemonade, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Wow! You have a lot of toys! - I have more than eighty, I think. - Really? - Maybe even more, I don't know. We changed the whole system a few years ago. Where's the chlorine plant? We don't produce our own whitener anymore. It's cheaper to import it, and we don't have to worry about the mercury. There used to be a plant over at the old mill, but it was too dangerous. I want to introduce you to some of the state committee members - who regulate the business. - What? Right now? No, no, no, no, no. Tonight, at dinner. The festival will have started then, - it should be a lot of fun. - Okay. Can you give me a hand? - You look beautiful. - Thank you. You almost ready? Almost. - Looks good, kiddo. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. You been doing this a long time? Yeah, about five years. I'm working to pay my studies. - Oh, yeah? - I'm almost a teacher. - You want to be a teacher? - Yeah. That's great. Here's our numbers. Hannah goes to bed at 8:30. She's gonna say 9:00. - It's 8:30. - Okay. We'll be home at 11:00. We're going to the... What is it? La fiesta de... - La Fiesta de los Nios Santos. - Yes, that's right. - The festival of the children? - Yeah, of the saints children. It has a very special meaning for the people of Santa Clara. Yeah, it seems like a very big celebration here. Well, not a celebration. The fiesta is more about remembering our past. It happened hundreds of years ago. The conquistadors reached Santa Clara, but when they got here, they just found a poor village, so they kidnapped all the children and locked them up in a temple and asked for a ransom... their weight in silver. The people of Santa Clara asked all the surrounding villages for help to gather enough silver to pay the ransom. The conquistadors kept the silver, but they didn't keep their word and they lit the temple on fire. With the children inside? Some people believe the ghosts of the kids are still around looking for revenge. Anything bad that happens is blamed on them. What do you believe? You know you can call us anytime while we're gone, okay? Even if it's just to say hi. Are you going to show your drawing to Catalina when I'm gone? Might do. - Come on, let's go. - Okay. - Buenos noches. - Buenos noches, Seor Harriman. Hey! - How are you? - Seor. Sarah, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, a very good man, Andrs Contreras, he's the local company doctor. - Oh, nice to meet you. - And you. - This is my husband, Paul. - How you doing? - My pleasure. - Nice to meet you. Por favor. Jordan! Jorge! - Senator. - Oh, thank you. Sarah, I'd like you to meet Senator Maraon. Sarah is going to be the new General Manager at the plant. - Oh, great. - I'm very excited to be here. I look forward to knowing more about this country. Very impressive indeed. Your father has been a great friend of our community for a long, long time. - Oh, come on. Come on, let's eat. - Okay. Doctor Contreras. Tomorrow we're going to play all the morning. Sounds good? But now it's time to sleep. - And have a good night, honey. - Thank you. Good night. Come on, Sarah. Dance with your father. So, what kind of job did you leave behind to come here? No, no, I'm keeping my job. I'm an illustrator. I illustrate children's books. I wish I could treat my patients from anywhere. You still have it. You were so young. I'm starting to forget what she looks like. She would have been proud of you. Did you grow up here? My parents moved here when I was a child, when my father started working as a doctor at the paper mill. Really? They lived in your house. My father had his clinic there. Oh, yeah? You ever live there? No. I was sent away to boarding school. Jordan sent Sarah to boarding school in the States. - Is that where you guys met? - No, no, we met in New York. We got married there and then we moved to London. We had our daughter, Hannah, and... - now we're here. - It's a good decision. I worry about moving her around too much, but you know we gotta be together, so... Many may advise against bringing children to a place like Santa Clara, but... - What do you mean? - Some people are concerned about safety. And the dark legends don't exactly help, either. Paul! Paul, come here! It's so beautiful. Well, it's not really. Five hundred years ago, the conquistadors came here looking for silver and burned all the children of this village alive. They put cloth on their faces to cover the burns. They're taking the statues to the church. People go there and pray to appease their angry spirits. Silver! Come here, Silver. Come here. Silver. - Hey. - Yeah? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. - Hi. - Hey. - You're back so early. - Oh, we're getting old. - How did everything go? - Fine. Just... fine. Is she asleep upstairs? Mum! Catalina! Mum! Catalina! Can you hear me? Mum! Help me! I'm stuck! Hannah! - No, she's not here. - Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah? Hannah! She's got to be up here. Hannah? The dumb waiter. - She's in here! She's in here! Hannah! - Come on. Oh, sweetie. Oh, you're okay, you're okay. - Hannah! - Sweetie, wake up. - Sweetie, sweetie, look at me. - Hannah! Hannah. - Open your eyes. - Hannah, open your eyes. She's burning up. - Hannah Holden? - Yeah. Have a fever, disorientation, pain in her joints. - It's probably the flu. - What about that rash? The rash could be anything. Something she ate or an insect bite. Do you know if she drank tap water? I don't think so, I told her not to. Excuse me. In my opinion, she needs to rest. She should take an aspirin and drink a lot of water. And we can keep her under observation if you want... and run a blood test, just to make sure. - That won't be necessary. - Excuse me? The company plan will cover it. If I may... Doctor, realistically, how long will it take you to get Hannah's blood test results back? - A few weeks. - Okay. We can have them back in less than 48 hours. Okay. We're going to have to do what's best for Hannah. Is she okay? I'm sorry about what happened. I don't understand how she got in there. I don't know. She was asleep when I checked. Come on, there's something strange going on here. What are you not telling us? Look, I'm not the kind of person who believes in these sort of things... but there was something around the house. Like ghosts. Okay, you know what? This is not going to work. I'm very sorry, but you don't have to come back tomorrow, okay? Okay. I'll call the company tomorrow and find somebody new. - Okay. - I'll watch Hannah tonight. - Okay. - Get some rest. Are you okay, sweetie? - Can I have some water, please? - Yeah, of course. Hi. Hey. - How's she doing? - She's been sleeping all day. Paul? Paul? What are you doing? Paul? Are you okay? I think I heard something. Hannah is awake. Let's go back inside the house. There's someone in there! - She's okay! She's okay! - Are you okay? I could have sworn that I saw someone up here. It's okay. I think we're just both really tired. And I think we need to get some rest. We've got to sleep. It's been a long night. Okay? Let's sleep. - Excuse me, Mara. - Yeah? Do you know where do we keep the... balance sheets? They are on the server and there are copies in your office. Yes, no, I saw those. I mean from like 20 years ago. - Mr. Harriman might know. - Sarah. She's fine. The results came back normal. No, she's not fine. And it's not just the flu. Okay, flu symptoms vary depending on the strain and environment... but no, it's probably an intestinal virus and it's very common in the tropics. Give her this for four days, twice a day. - She'll be fine. - Okay. What was that about? What they don't teach you at business school. Have you seen the financials from 20 years ago? I can't find them. Yeah, that's tricky. Everything is computerized now. I don't even know where half that old stuff is. I'll get someone to dig it out for you. - Tell me, how's Hannah? - Contreras thinks it's an intestinal virus. Are you going to be all right when I go to Sao Paulo? Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah, I think so. I think we gotta get a second opinion here, Sarah. She's getting worse and these pills, they're not working. Look at this. Why didn't you call me? I don't know. Listen, I think I gotta get her home. Until she's better, I think I gotta get her to a real hospital. No. - What do you mean, no? - No, we should all go. It's my fault. It's my fault for bringing her here. This is not your fault. We both brought her here, you know that. - We should leave here tomorrow. - Okay. Everything is gonna be okay, sweetie. - I'm gonna make a cup of tea. - Okay. I want to stay up with her tonight. Sarah? - Yeah, I'm just looking for a candle! - Okay. Sarah? You okay? Where is my daughter? Mummy! Hannah! Stop! Oko-maha-neea. Oko-maha-neea. Oko-maha-neea. Where is my daughter? Oko-maha-neea. Hannah! Stop! - Hannah! - Sarah! Hannah! Wait up! Sarah! Let her go! Stop! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! - Try to stay calm, Sarah. - Okay. - I'll call the senator. - Thank you. Thank you, Dad. Try to stay calm. I'll take the next plane home, I'll be there tomorrow morning. - He's getting on a plane tomorrow. - Okay. Sir, you were saying... Sorry. I was saying, it's a bit difficult to explain, but our daughter wasn't alone. - Was she with her nanny? - No, she was not with the nanny she was... she was dragged away by kids, she was dragged away by little kids. - Teenagers? - No, little kids. - They tied her up and they... - It was a huge storm... with all of the lightning and darkness, it must be very disorienting. I know what I saw. I know what she saw. My daughter is missing. Can you please just tell me what you're gonna do to find her? I know it's hard for parents to sit back, but it's too easy to get lost in these jungles, especially for people who aren't familiar with them. Our best people are already out there looking for her. We'll do everything we can to find her, okay? Trust us, we'll find your daughter. Come on, guys! I can't stay here. I can't... I can't do it. I can't wait for them to come back and tell me haven't found her. I can't do it. - Well, I can't wait around here, either. - Yeah, but one of us has to stay. Let me try and go and do something. - Try what? - I don't know. I'm going to find her. Excuse me, "Santa Clara, Calle siete, apartamentos"? Yeah, up the stairs, around back. Up there? Paul? I need your help, Catalina. They took Hannah. What do you mean? You said you saw something in the jungle. Well, so did I. I saw it, too. I saw the kids and I need your help. How can I help you? What does "Oko-maha-neea" mean? This is it, this is Oko-maha-neea. In Spanish it's "Aguas Rojas", "Red Waters". Let's go. A lot of people in this part of town only speak Koreguaje... - so let me do the talking. - So where do we go? If you want to find out what's going on around here... there's only one place. The church. This church was built on the remains of the temple... where the Nios Santos were burned alive. That's why they bring their statues here? Yes. Let me talk to the priest. - Father, how are you? - So good to see you again! Wait! Stop! Where's my daughter? Stop! Hey! What are you doing here? One of those kids went in there. Hello? Hello? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay! It's okay! Do you have a picture? Yeah. Here. Her name is Hannah and she was taken earlier tonight. I think your son might have some idea what happened to my daughter. Her son died 20 years ago. No! Some nights she still sees him, in the shadows, her little Daniel. This is the boy that I followed. He always listened and behaved, but one morning he wanted to go out to play. She refused. He had been sick for many days. Fever, rash... same as his friends. But he insisted. And he never came back. He disappeared. They all did. Now all she wants is for someone to tell her what happened. I'm very sorry. He says it was the Nios Santos. Many people said it was a curse, that the Nios Santos made the children sick and then took them. But she doesn't believe that. If she doesn't believe that, then what did happen? The river... it was something in the water. We're running out of time. Tell her that my daughter was sick, too. Just like her son. What did you do? Nobody helped us, nobody cared. It was a difficult time for them. And her husband lost his job because they closed the paper mill. What paper mill? The paper mill is that way. The old Harriman mill. I have to go there. Sarah? Are you okay? - What is this? - Files. These children have the same symptoms as my daughter! They all have the same diagnosis. Mercury poisoning. - What is going on here? - I don't know. No, your signature is all over them. Look! Okay, let me see. It's not my signature. What? What are you talking about? It's my father's. Look at the date. My father was the company doctor at the time. Just like I am now. That's my father. And where is he? Where is he now? He died 20 years ago. Any news? I spoke to Maraon on the way from the airport. The federal police are getting involved. What do you know about mercury poisoning? Mercury poisoning? Why? Nine children were sick with mercury poisoning in 1992... and the company doctor treated them. We had some mercury leakage at the old mill. - They died! - We tried to save them. But it was too late. We did what we had to do to protect the company. They were just children! They have families. Do you think I set out to kill these children deliberately? Do you think I'm a monster? When I came here 20 years ago, there was nothing, just a river and some poor fisherman. Now they have jobs, pensions, doctors. I came to this jungle and civilized it. Business is tough, Sarah. Difficult decisions have to be made. And sometimes... Sometimes there's collateral damage. Hannah is sick with mercury poisoning. Is she collateral damage? That's impossible. We have no mercury at the plant anymore, I told you that. Those children took Hannah, I'm telling you, I saw it with my own eyes. That's delusional. Those children are dead and buried. Where are their families? I need to speak with them. Those families can't help you. They know nothing. You never told them? Where did you put the bodies? Which way is it? Look! She's in here somewhere. - Hannah! - Hannah! - Hannah! - Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! Wait! Sarah! Hannah, are you there? Wait! Where is my daughter? Hannah! Hannah! - Can you hear me? - Mermaid! Hannah! Mommy's here! - Sarah! - Paul? - Sarah, don't move. - Paul? - It's stuck! - Where are you? - Don't move! I'm here! - Paul, where are you? Sarah! - What are you doing here? Are you okay? - Yes, yes. - She's here. - Where? I don't know, I heard her! I heard her somewhere. I saw those kids. - Mermaid. - What? - Do you hear that? - Yeah. Hannah! Mermaid. Mermaid. - Dream! - What? Come on. It's our game. Hannah? Are you there? Elevator. Rabbits. Silver. River! Rock. Kid! Give me back my granddaughter. - Oko-maha-neea. - Please. She's innocent. It's me you want. Kid! Kid! Dead. Hannah! Dad! - She's here! - Hannah! Dad! Are you okay? - I can't open it! - Are you okay? Dad! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Oh, my God! Hannah! Hannah! Hannah, I'm sorry. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hannah! Please, please! Oh, God! - Look at me! Look at me! - Hannah! - Look at me! Look at me! - Hannah! Hannah. - Oh, no, no, no! - It's okay, it's okay. - No! - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Mummy. Daddy. - You're okay! You're okay! You're okay! Oh, you're okay! You're okay! You're okay!
