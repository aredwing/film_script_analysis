Eveybody line up. Line up! Santa's coming! Hello, Eli. Eveyone is welcome here Santa's shop is full of cheer Come on There's lots more to be done Christmas season starts today Hury up and fill the sleigh These toys are filled with so much joy lt's tinker time The deadline's Christmas Eve We're working hard to fill the sleigh So Santa Claus can leave Each year you see You can depend on me We'll make the perfect Christmas toy For evey girl and boy Happy Birthday, Santa dear Sixteen hundred special years with you How fast the seasons flew Make a wish and blow them out Celebrate a life about good cheer Here's to another year Thank you, eveyone! What a cake! Make a wish, Santa! - May l have this dance? - Why, yes. Special delivey, Santa. A gift for me? Just arrived by North Pole Express. lt's from the Big Apple. ''Dear Mr Claus: l regret to inform you of Mr Hucklebuckle's recent passing. He explicitly asked me, as his trusted attorney, to write to you and thank you for your Ioyal friendship throughout the years.'' Oh, dear. ''Mr Hucklebuckle enjoyed passing on your message to the children of New York. You taught him the true meaning of Christmas spirit... ...and the joy of a life of service. l've sent you the birthday present from Mr Hucklebuckle... ...that he had hoped to give you himself. Sincerely... Mr Stewart.'' Mr Hucklebuckle was a great ambassador for the Santa Cause. Wow. Look at this place. - It's so nostalgic. - Yeah, that's one word for it. l used to spend Christmas here as a kid. Nothing has changed. What's this? ls this a Santa chair? Grandpa used to dress up for the kids. l'm sure the suit is still around here somewhere. He loved the whole Christmas season. Mr Hucklebuckle, l presume. - l'm Mr Stewart. - Actually, it's Huckle. l changed it years ago. And this must be Mrs Huckle. Please, call me Kate. My condolences for your loss. Your grandfather was more than a client, he was a dear friend. l remember him fondly. So, as we were discussing on the telephone, your grandfather left you the key to the store to do as you wish. That's good. We're gonna put the building on the market immediately. There is, however, one stipulation. You need to operate the store through one Christmas season profitably before the deed can be transferred. We live in Los Angeles, Mr Stewart, all right? And l'm a CPA with a full roster of clients. And look at this place. Here, look at these toys. Kids don't want to play with this stuff anymore. It's... lt's old-fashioned. Your grandfather used to say that children's imaginations don't change. They're timeless. These toys even remind me of my childhood. Back when they didn't make video games. We'll keep the store open through Christmas, Mr Stewart. Kate, we can't just pick up and leave. Your grandfather's apartment on the upper level is open to you. Plenty of room, and l'm sure your children will love it here. We haven't been blessed with any children. l'm sory. l'll be back Christmas Day, Mr Hucklebuckle. - Again, it's Huckle. - Yes, of course. Happy Holidays. Mery Christmas. Don't wory, Quinn. It'll be vey nice in there. There'll be other kids for you to play with. Come on. OK. - Yes? - Hi, Ms Stout? l believe you're expecting us. l'm Mrs Gibson from Social Services and this... ...is Quinn. Oh, yes, the new one. Come right in. Oh, my. The place could use a little Christmas cheer, don't you think? lf l got more money from the state, maybe l could afford some Christmas decorations. Oh, here you go... for Quinn's monthly care. Shall we introduce Quinn to the other girls? They're studying. l take their home schooling vey seriously. Quinn, l'll be back in a little bit. To make sure you've settled in. Goodbye. Ms Stout. Sit there. l'll have someone show you around, and more importantly, fill you in on all my rules. Willamina! Willamina! - Have you seen Willamina? - No. Janie, where's Ms Stout? Where have you been, missy? l was just playing in the alley. New kid, much cuter than you, and younger, l'm sure she'll go fast. l want you to show her around, introduce her to the girls, and make sure she understands my rules. Why do l always have to show the new kids around? Because you're the oldest and l hold you accountable for her behaviour. Willamina, this is Quinn. Scared? You'll get used to it. And it's Will, not Willamina. Come on, l'll show you around. - This is the living room. - But where's the Christmas tree? Ms Stout can't stand Christmas, so none of us are allowed to have it. No merriness, no festivity. She confiscates any toys. And most of all, she hates any kind of singing. Eveyone, this is Quinn. Quinn, that's Janie, Meg, Taylor, and May. What happened to your parents? They didn't make it. They had to go to heaven. Mine neither. Janie's too, but she still thinks they're gonna come for her. They are gonna come for me. You'll see. And maybe even before Christmas. Nobody's parents are coming for them. That's why we're here, silly. Your only chance is to get adopted. - What's ''dopted?'' - Adopted. That's when a new mom and dad think you're cute and take you home. They like little kids. Not older ones like me. Come on, l'll show you where we sleep. Jenny just left, so l guess this is your bed now. l'll let you settle in, and l'll be back in a little bit. All right, Eli. What was so important? Well, we all know you've been feeling a little blue, sir, and l think with the help of a little Christmas magic, we could cheer you up. My goodness! l guess he's going to need a name! He is yours to name, dear. l think l'm going to name you Paws. You and l are going to be best friends for all eternity. - Eternity? How long is that? - Why, forever, young pup! Yes, wonderful. Yes, vey nice. Take the reins, Paws! Easy! Here, let me help you there, Paws! Honey, this store has barely broken even for the past 30 years. And what's curious is that Grandpa made a profit of exactly one cent evey year. Well, l have a feeling your grandfather was not in this for the money. Then why did he put that stipulation in the will that we have to make a profit over Christmas? l don't know. Maybe Grandpa Hucklebuckle wanted to make sure the store was run properly. We need something to bring in customers. What about a store Santa? Kids love to go see Santa. - Yes, a store Santa, of course. - Yeah. That's a great idea! Where do you get a store Santa? l don't know... the Internet? Who will kiss my head When l lie in bed And who will hold my hand Who will understand Who will sing my song to me Who will hold me tight ln the dark of night And who will brush my hair Rock me in my chair Who will sing my song to me Who will sing my song to me Now that you are gone What are you doing out here? You better get in here. It's almost lights out! What's that? My mom's favourite Christmas decoration from when she was a little girl. We used to hang it on the tree together. lt's nice. Don't let Ms Stout see it, OK? - Don't let Ms Stout see what? - Nothing. What are my rules about toys? - Hey, that's mine! - Not anymore! - Please! You can't just... - Watch me! l've got some errands to run. Will, you're in charge. And the rest of you had better be fast asleep by the time l get back. lt's OK, Janie. We'll get it back. No, we won't. We both know where it's going. It's never coming back. Where is it going? OK, sir, l've prepped the reindeer for landing in Central Park. Ever since Mr Hucklebuckle's passing, Christmas spirit has been out of whack in New York. You mo be careful down there and stick together. l'll watch out for Santa. That's what best friends are for! Don't you wory, my darling, we'll be fine. We'll visit some ambassadors for the Santa Cause, talk to the children and be back in a Christmas minute. - l packed you a bag. - Thank you. Your suit, hat, gloves, and some of my sugarplum pie. And you seem to have forgotten your North Pole pin. l love you. - Goodbye, Santa! - Bye, Santa! Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Vixen, on Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen! Will? You awake? lt's just the incinerator, Quinn. Janie said Ms Stout put her doll in there, and if we didn't behave Ms Stout would put us in there, too. She's just saying that to scare us. Ms Stout is not gonna put Janie or anyone else in there. Go back to bed, OK? Oh, there she is, Paws, the grand lady. - The Statue of Libem. - Wow! She's amazing. Whoa! Comet, our landing spot is Central Park. - Put her down gently. - All right, Santa. Wow! UFO. That's good. Well... OK, fellas, you get some rest. We'll be here waiting for you, Santa. Yes, come on, Paws. Nice bag. l love the energy of New York City. There's nothing like it. Wow, this is way huger than the workshop. Now, Paws, New York City is a great big place with a lot of people, and only those who believe in the magic of Christmas can understand North Pole animals like you. So you need to be vey careful. What the heck? Watch where you're going, you old geezer! l'm so sory, ma'am. Here, let me help you with these. Just arrived in the big city. Stop your dog from yapping. Shouldn't he be on a leash? Not eveyone has the Christmas spirit, Paws. She's not vey jolly. Why don't you mind your own beeswax, buster. Mery Christmas. - Madam, your hat! - Don't wory. l'll get it. Paws! No! Stop! Did you see that? Santa! Are you OK? - Oh, no! Santa's hurt! - That guy just got hit. Help, somebody help! Oh, Mr Elf, Mr Elf! l need your assistance. Santa's really hurt! Oh, no! He just walked out. - Anyone know first aid? - l got this under control, sir. l'm a... paramedical guy. Mr Elf, wait up! Look, there's no need for you to stick around. You can get outta here. All right, move along, eveybody! Move along! There's nothing to see here! Get away from me, you mutt! l'm gonna have to report you to Eli, Santa's head elf. What have we here? Nice, vey nice. Help! You all right there, bud? Gus saw your whole mishap. Could say l saved your life. Where am l? New York City. Manhattan. Ring a bell? All l hear is bells. Jingle bells in fact. Come on, let's get up. Oh, no! Which way was Santa? - Thank you for your assistance. - Yeah. - Anyway you could direct me to... - Yeah. No, no, l'm in... l'm in a bit of a hury, bud. See you around. Bud? Excuse me? Pardon me? Pardon me? - We're in a rush. - Excuse me? Excuse me? l... Excuse me? l was hoping you could help me. You see, l don't quite remember where l live, or anything else for that matter. Though l do have a vague recollection that l was supposed to be heading north. Then just take the north line. Why, thank you for your assistance. You're a fine young man. - Mery Christmas! - Yeah, Mery Christmas to you, too. Can anyone help me? l'm looking for Santa Claus. What do we got here? This whole night has been a bust. It's just... - What is...? - Mery Christmas. Happy Holidays! Hey, Mery Christmas. Thank you vey much. Thank you. Hey! Hey! This is my turf, bud! Scram! - l don't want any trouble, l just... - Leave the bell! - OK, OK, OK! - Ho, ho, ho! Ho. Ho, ho, ho! Happy Christmas... Happy Christmas to you. Hucklebuckle Toys? Well, the lady at the Santa Claus agency laughed at me when l asked if they had any available store Santas. l had no idea how beautiful this store was. Look. Kate, just don't get too attached to this place, all right? lt'll be up for sale as soon as it's ours, and then we're gonna go back to LA. lt was kind of nice to have an extra project to take my mind off it all. l was kind of dreading the Christmas season without a child. l know, honey, come here. Come on. Let's call it a night, OK? - We had a big day. - Yeah. Hucklebuckle. Good morning. Thank you. Hello. How are you? Morning. Hey, the agency must have found one. He's... perfect. Look at him with his beard, and the kind eyes, and that belly. Yes. l guess l could stand to lose a few pounds! And the laugh is pretty good. Vey convincing. - Great job, honey! - Well... Wow... What a beautiful place this is. Thank you. It's been in our family for years. - So, can you start today? - Start? You're looking for work, right? Well... More like a home, really. You see, l'm new in town and... a little disoriented. l didn't get your name. My name... Bud. They call me Bud. Vey pleased to meet you, Bud. l'm Kate. This is my husband, James. Hi, Bud. Well, what kind of work is it, exactly? Oh, in-store Santa. You know, you talk to the kids, you ask them what they want for Christmas, you listen. Oh, that sounds like something l could handle. - Great! - So, we have a deal. Bud, if you'd like the job, and you need a place to stay, we do have a spare room with a bed in it. Yeah, here, let me show you. l don't know if you have your own or whatever, but if you don't mind, we would love for you to wear my grandfather's old Santa suit. - Yeah, for good luck. - Certainly, l don't mind! Great. All right. All right, the Santa suit is in this closet. l hope it fits. Why, hello, Cindy Cramord! Oh, l'm sory. Must have been a case of mistaken identity. Franklin, you animal! - Are we still on for Friday night? - l'll call you. l've gotta go get my hair done. Where are you going? - Who says l'm going anywhere? - Can l come? OK, but we have to hury. Come on. All right, Ms Stout takes mo hours to get her hair done. l don't know why she bothers. She looks like a hedgehog. What's a hedgehog? lt fits perfectly. l hope your grandpa's suit fits Bud. You know Grandpa Hucklebuckle used to say that Santa himself gave it to him. Do l look funny? No. No. Bud, you look great. lf l wasn't an adult, l'd believe you were Santa himself. l don't think you're ever too old to believe. Why don't you ty the chair out, Bud? lsn't that the most beautiful bike you've ever seen? - Is this Santa's workshop? - No, silly, it's just a toy store. You have to have money to buy stuff. Will, look! It's Santa Claus! He's not real. He's just here to help sell toys. lt's rather comfortable. Ho, ho, ho, Mery Christmas! You can come in. l don't got any money to buy toys. That's OK, sweetie. What's your name? - Quinn. - Quinn? Are you here with your mom and dad? They didn't make it. Then who are you here with? ls that your big sister? Do you wanna talk to Santa? OK. Come on. And who do we have here? This is Quinn. Quinn. That's a pretty name. Would you like to tell Santa what you want for Christmas? Well, hop on up. Sory. l had to see if you were real. That's quite all right. So what would you like Santa to get you for Christmas, little one? l'd like it if you could give Will the bike in the window. She's really nice, even if she doesn't believe in Santa. And the girls at the foster home need something to cheer them up. Like a puppy or something. lsn't she adorable? Come on, Quinn, we have to go! We'll see what Santa can do for your friend, Will, and the girls. Thank you. Mery Christmas! Mery Christmas, Quinn. l told you. Santa is not real. No, l pinched him. He's real. You'll see. Whatever you asked for won't happen. My mom says Christmas wishes come true if you believe. - Well, your mom was fibbing. - Take it back! - What? - Take back what you said about my mom. No, l won't! Santa is made-up. Bud? What did she ask you for? Well... She wanted me to get her friend, Will, that red bike in the window. And a puppy to cheer up the girls in the foster home. - She's an orphan? - Yeah. Aren't you a little fluffy poodle? Hury up, laddies! l'll take care of this lass. Disgusting! You filthy little poochie. Let's go. Get out of here, you mongrels! - Hey, those are my sausages! - Maybe those dogs have seen Santa. Get back here! Hey, that wasn't vey nice of you guys. Go sniff a hydrant, meddler! Yeah, laddie, who invited you to the pam? Allow me to introduce myself. l'm Paws, from the North Pole. Yeah, mon, and l be da tooth faiy. Listen, laddie, just because we're street dogs doesn't mean we're daft. You're clearly another one of those uptown dogs with that bonny collar. State your business, buster, before l bite ya like a chew toy. l need help finding Santa Claus. You expect us to believe you know the man himself? What's in it for us, pal? Well, l'm sure Santa Claus will appreciate your help and may even take you off the naughty list. Naughty list. Gotcha! - Help us, mon! - Help! And where have you mo been? l was just showing Quinn where to take out the garbage. Well, l find that vey interesting seeing as how we burn all the trash... ...in the incinerator. Your hair looks really pretty, Ms Stout. - You don't say? - Yeah. Yeah, like a hedgehog! But that's what you said. l think it's time we show Quinn the consequences of breaking the rules. lnside! Willamina knows that when you break the rules, you get to spend all night down here in the basement. You don't wanna be locked down here all night, do you? Well, good. l'm glad we understand each other. You're staying here, and no dinner for you, either. New kids always get me in trouble. All right, doggies. Let's get you in lockup. Bursting bagpipes! - Help! - The situation is dire, mon! Hang on, guys. l'll be right back. You mutt! Where did he go, mon? Paws, you gotta bust us outta here! Stand back, guys. Come on, guys! Quick! Let's run like da wind, mon! Let's bust this joint! - Get out of my way! - Hey, watch it! - What's a matter with you people? - Get out of the road! Dat was amazing! You really are Santa Claus' dog, mon. And that means we really are on the naughty list! Oh, yes, T-Money. Multiple infractions. You did us a solid, mon. You be cool with us. Now we're your peeps. We'll keep an eye out for Santa. Fo' real. Thanks, guys. l hate to interrupt, but we've got to get away from the dogcatcher. You go hide, Paws. We got him covered. There you are! How am l ever gonna find Santa? One leaf from the Silver Linden and the nature badge is all mine! Whoa! Hey, kid, do you believe in Santa Claus? - You can talk? - We're from the North Pole. We can communicate with all creatures, as long as you believe in Santa Claus. - l believe in Santa Claus. - That's great! Look, we need a big favour. Santa's been gone longer than we expected. We're worried about him. Christmas is right around the corner. But if you're Santa's reindeer, why can't you just fly back to the North Pole for help? We can't fly without the Christmas magic in Santa's cystal, and we have no idea where he is. We need you to find Santa Claus for us. But there must be a thousand Santas in New York! But there's only one real Santa Claus. You'll know him when you find him. As a member of the 23rd Street Junior Wilderness Adventurers, - l will do my level best, Mr... - l'm Comet. - That's Dancer. - Mr Comet, l'm Jimmy. That's my leader. l have to go! l'm here! Here! Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, you gotta stay with the group. Now, come on. Let's go to the Junior Wilderness Adventurer cave! Marching. Marching. One, mo, three, one, mo, three... Help! Help! Has anybody seen Santa? Help! Santa? Where are you? Can anybody hear me? - Hey, have you seen Santa Claus? - You're a dog! l've never met a dog that talks before. - Where did you come from? - l came from the North Pole. - My name's Paws. - l'm Quinn. Does that mean you know Santa Claus? Yeah! He's my best friend. But l can't find him and l'm supposed to take care of him. Wow! He sure is quick at granting wishes. l have to go. If l get caught out here, l'll have to go to the basement. Can l come with you? l'm really lost. The lady here is mean, so we have to hide you real good. Come on! Come on, Paws! We can sleep here tonight and l can help you look for Santa tomorrow. - Good night, Paws. - Good night, Quinn. - Thank you. - Hello! And what's your name, young man? Braiden. Bratty Braiden. lt's what my brother and sister call me. Well, l see a kind boy who wants to bring joy to his family. - Really? - Yes, really. Now what would you like to give your brother and sister for Christmas? - Honey. - What? Bud is so amazing. The kids are just drawn to him. Excuse me. - Can you help me pick out a few toys? - Sure. My friend, Alice, told me all about your store. She was so impressed with your Santa. Said he got them all right into the Christmas spirit. Thank you! And what would you like for Christmas, Tatiana? - That on the left. - Oh, yeah. - And that on the right. - Those mo train tracks. Well, Santa will see what he can do. Mery Christmas! - Excuse me? - Yeah? - Hi, are you the owner? - Yes, sir. How can l be of assistance? Just... your store Santa was suggesting to my kid that he buy presents for kids in need. Oh, l'm sory. l'll have a word with him. No, that's great. l just wanted to say that we love that your store gives a free present to a needy child - with evey purchase. - Excuse me. Kate, did you hear what Bud is telling the children? Yes, and l think it is such a good idea. - No, we can't afford that! - Honey, look around. This place could use some Christmas cheer. Paws! Wow! How did you get this stuff here? Quinn! What are you doing in here? Where did these Christmas decorations come from? Where did you find this puppy? l didn't find him, he found me. He came from the North Pole on Santa's sleigh. Paws, this is Will. Quinn, that dog can't bark in here. Do you have any idea how much trouble we'll get in? But he's not barking, he's talking! Quinn, dogs don't talk. She can't understand me, Quinn. She's just not a believer yet. We need to help him, Will. We need to show him the way to Santa. We know where he is. Quinn, l told you that Santa in the store is not real. Thank you, sir. It's going to a vey needy cause. Thank you vey much! Ho, ho, ho! Mery Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Yes, sir, what can l do for you? Santa, sir, are you the one and only? Sure, kid. You put money in that bag and l'll pretend to be anyone you want me to be. Ho, ho, ho! Mery Christmas. Hey, you're still on my nice list! And it's the little engine that could here in New York City. This small toy store has gathered quite the crowd of people. They've come here to experience a little of what they're calling the true spirit of Christmas. l'm here with Mr and Mrs Hucklebuckle. Actually, it's, uh, Huckle. We shortened the name. So, why is eveyone coming to Hucklebuckle Toys to meet your Santa? Well, of course, the real Santa is busy in the North Pole, but our Santa, Bud, he... he inspires the true spirit of Christmas. They also like our Christmas Spirit Programme. Purchase a hundred dollars in toys, and we gift a toy to a child in need. - Well, that's wonderful. - Mery Christmas to you, too! - Bud! Bud, come here! - Let's talk to Santa himself. - Yeah. Come here, Bud. - Mery Christmas. - Santa! - Hello, and Mery Christmas! Santa, the kids really seem to love you. With hundreds of toy store Santas all across New York City, what makes you so special? Nothing really, l'm just an ambassador for the Santa Cause. One of many spreading the Christmas spirit to children around the world, reminding them of what's important. A little humble pie. How refreshing. Well, actually my favourite is sugarplum pie. There you have it: sugarplum. Here in New York City. Bud, are you OK? - You sent for us, Mrs Claus? - Yes, Eli. Santa and Paws should be home by now. We were just thinking the same thing. He did say it was just gonna be a quick trip. Well, let's check the map. Ellis, bring up New York. Santa Claus and Paws aren't even together. Something is definitely amiss. Santa would never leave Paws alone. He's just a pup. Eddy, Eli, you need to go to New York and find them. Yes, Mrs Claus. We'll ready the truck and head right down. lt was another big day today, Bud. Oh, you must have seen 200 children. Yeah, Bud, you really seem like you enjoy listening to the children. l do. Someone once told me that the spirit of Christmas is embodied in the hearts of children, untouched as yet by the fears, doubts and disappointments of the adult world. That is so beautiful. Who told you that? l can almost picture her face. l do know she's the most beautiful woman in the world. Bud, you seem really tired. Are you all right? Oh, yes, of course, quite all right. l suppose l just need some Yuletide rest. - Well, good night. - Good night. - Good night, Bud. All right. - Yes, good night. Honey, l'm really worried about Bud. He doesn't seem vey good. Do you think we're pushing him too hard? Well, he certainly earned a raise. We're killing it. James, l am seriously concerned for his health. Well, it's not long until Christmas, and then he can take a nice vacation, somewhere tropical. OK, OK. Look, l will see what l can do. Ms Stout is going out. We've got mo hours. Wow. This is the only way Bud would take a break. You saw the line out there. Think of all that lost revenue. Oh, no. Ho, ho, ho! All right. Coming over here. This is the place Santa's selling toys. OK, l'll be right back. OK, you're done. Thank you for coming. That's not the real Santa. Will was right? l have modified the ELF compressor to change the truck into any type of New York City vehicle that we would like it to be. Let's melt snow. Who knows what kind of trouble Santa Claus and Paws are in? - Bye, Eddy! - Bye, Eli! Here we go! Don't you wory again. l'm good to go for the rest of the day after that generous break. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Piece of cake? - Those kids are scay. Hello, young man, and how can l help you? l hope you're the real Santa Claus, 'cause you're the 63rd one l've seen, and l'm getting really pooped. You are a dedicated young man! Comet asked me to find the real Santa and give him a message. Your reindeer are waiting for you in Central Park! Santa, sir, that's the message. l hope you're the real deal. Jimmy... l don't know if l'm the real Santa Claus or not. But here's a pin to thank you for your persistence. l believe someone vey special gave it to me. Whoa. Thank you, Santa, sir, and a Mery Christmas. Mery Christmas to you, too, Jimmy. Sory that wasn't the real Santa. lt's OK, Quinn. We'll find him. Quinn, you got a puppy? Come on. Come on. - His name is Paws. - Where'd he come from? l'm Santa Claus' best friend from the North Pole. He just talked! Don't tell me you guys are imagining things, too. Only kids that truly believe in Christmas spirit can hear me talk. - How can you not hear him? - Are your ears working properly? He's talking right to you. You gotta believe, Will. Just listen. Whenever l hear a Christmas song l wanna get up and sing Wherever there's love l sing along And find some bells to ring Wherever there's angels up above Wherever there's Christmas trees There's gonna be peace and hope and love And wonderful memories There'll be laughter There'll be song We'll go carolling all night long Believing in Christmas makes it magic Can't you see?

Willamina, who brought a puppy in here? lt was me, Ms Stout. l found Paws. Nice ty, Quinn, but l don't believe you. Don't think l don't know who the ringleader of this circus is. Willamina, come with me! Well, that's a pretty gem. No, don't! Not my cystal! And the rest of you, clean up this mess and take off those ridiculous dresses, now! Well, l hope you enjoy each other's company here in the pitch-black. Tomorrow, the mutt goes to the pound. What is that, a Christmas decoration? No! What are my rules about Christmas decorations? My mom gave that to me! Please give it back! No! Now, get upstairs before you end up in the basement, too! Scoot! Why don't l believe ln happiness and dreams? And where do l belong? Where did it go wrong? Who will come and rescue me? Don't give up, Will. All you have to do is believe. Evemhing's going to be OK. l can understand you, Paws. You do believe in Christmas, after all! l do believe in Christmas l believe in love As sure as there is Santa Ringing sleigh bells up above We do believe in harmony ln family And good cheer Throughout the year lt's just not like Bud to be so late. Well, l don't think we can hold them back much longer. l'd better go check on him. Bud? Bud, are you OK? It's almost 9.15. My apologies, Kate. l'm feeling a tad under the weather this morning. Oh, no. Oh, Bud! Thank goodness. ABC wants to do a quick interview with you on your break today. - Well, l'll do my best, Mr Huckle. - All right. James! Call an ambulance! Good morning, Paws. Paws? Paws! Paws! What's with all the dramatics? What? You want me to take a stuffed toy dog to the pound? Can't do that. Where did the puppy go? Did you let him escape? - No! - You give me that dog! - Give it! You give it! - No! Let go of him! No, stop! We're here at New York General with a stoy that is spreading throughout the globe. An unknown store Santa Claus from Hucklebuckle Toys who became a beacon of light this holiday season is now clinging to life in a Manhattan hospital. lf you know his identity, please call James or Kate Huckle at Hucklebuckle Toys in Manhattan. l don't know what happened. l woke up and all that was there was that stuffed dog. The map shows Santa's in the park. He looks like Santa... but he's definitely not Santa. Augustus. Hello. l'm Eli, Santa's head elf, and this is Eddy. Great, now l'm seeing elves. What are you guys, from the North Pole? Yes, we are. You just talked, didn't you? Well, sure l did. l'm an elf dog. Well, Gus. You finally have lost it. - That's Santa's cystal! - That explains the beard. The magic of Santa's cystal has been changing you. - Where did you get this? - This old guy, he got hit by a taxi. He gave me his suitcase and this cystal. No? l took both of them, but l feel terrible about it. Eddy... ...without Santa's magic cystal, he could become mortal... and eventually... We've got to find him before it's too late. Do you know where he is? No. But look, look! l do know where there's some reindeer. Come on, l'll show you! Over here, over here, right here. Ta-da! Eli? Eddy, is that you? lt most certainly is. We're here to rescue you all! Hallelujah! We've been so worried. Santa's lost his cystal and is in grave danger. We need you all to stand by the sleigh, ready to fly at a moment's notice. l'm afraid we're all too weak. We need something to eat. We need to find eggnog, gingerbread cookies, fruitcake, things like that. l know a place! l'll take care of them! Where are you going? That's where Paws is. He's our only hope now. l'll go get the food! Come on, Eddy! Thank you. Next stop: Staten Island! Mery Christmas, girls. l'm Eli, and this is Eddy. We're Santa's elves from the North Pole. Thank goodness you're here. Paws was here, but l woke up and all that was there was a stuffed toy. - A stuffed toy? His cystal! - Did it come off? Yes! Ms Stout took it off him and we don't know where either of them are. We have to find both fast and put his cystal back on - before his life force runs out. - Hury! Go! - OK, OK. - Go! Hury! Comet, l'm here to report back to you. l met 122 possible Santa Clauses and all of them are clearly impostors. - But l did find one who... - Hey! You guys! l got evemhing l could find. Hello, sir. l'm here on official North Pole business. Hey, me too! l'm Gus, l'm a North Pole helper. - Mr Gus. l'm Jimmy. - How ya doin', Jimmy? Hey, Jimmy, where did you get that pin? That's Santa's! That's what l was about to tell you! He gave me this! Wait a second, if you've seen Santa Claus, we'd better get you to the elves. Hey, you guys eat up! Come on, Jimmy! We'll be right back. Oh, my goodness! Hang on, Paws! l'm coming! l found the cystal, but Paws wasn't there! Come on! - Quinn! - l have to save Paws! Turn the power off! Come on, Quinn. Get out. OK, OK. There's still life force in him. lt's really good to see you, Paws. Eli! Eddy! Thank goodness you're here! We have to find Santa. We have to get him his cystal back. Come on, let's go! - l'll knock. - Come on, open up! Eli, Eddy. This is Jimmy. He thinks he's seen... Santa Claus. - He gave me this! - Santa's pin! - He's at Hucklebuckle Toys! - We know where that is! - Girls, get your coats! - OK, come on, Quinn. Check it out, guys. That's Paws. We found him! Get in the car. In the car! OK. - l better get home. - Mission accomplished, Jimmy. - We'll take it from here. - l better give you this pin back. No, no, no. You keep it, Jimmy. You're an official Santa's helper now. Wow! l will wear it with pride. Thank you, Mr Elf. Well, we can't just stand here lollygagging. Let's follow them, laddies! Not a single call from anyone that knows of Bud's family or identity. Poor Bud. Should we go visit him in the hospital again? Yeah. lt's those girls from the foster home, and some interesting-looking friends. Well, go let them in! - We're here to save Santa Claus. - You mean Bud? Bud is Santa Claus. She is correct. Allow me to introduce myself. l'm Eli, Santa's head elf. This is Eddy the Elf Dog, and Paws, Santa's best friend. We're all from the North Pole. Santa lost his magic cystal and his health must have been deteriorating ever since. Honey, that dog is talking. l see you believe in the Christmas spirit. You know, l didn't always. You know, l hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you're right. He's in the hospital in critical condition. - Oh, no! - We have to go there now. They won't release him to us. Only next of kin. We have to find a way of getting Santa out of the hospital - and back to the North Pole. - l have a plan. Willamina! lt's about time you open up, you little... To what do we owe the honour of this visit? l received a phone call from a neighbour. Someone named Eli Elf. He said that the children were Ieft here all night alone, and it appears mo of the girls, Will and Quinn, are missing! Yes. Right, we were looking for them. You are no longer permitted in this house, by order of the State of New York. And furthermore, if anything has happened to those children, you will be held accountable. But l love those little brats! You can't do this to me! You guys go, go! l just did. All right, we're good. Come on, let's go. Come on, hury. Come on! - Go, go. - OK, OK... - Honey... - OK, all right. Over here, over here. - That's it. Get him in here. - l got it. - Hold on. All right. - OK, ready? One, mo, three! - That's a lot of gingerbread! - OK, come on. Let's go. Let's go! Come on. Get in! ls he gonna be OK? ls Santa going to die? We don't know, sweetie. He has to make it. Eli? Take my cystal off and place it next to Santa's. Paws, if you do that, we might not be able to bring you back a second time. And you may become a stuffed toy forever. We have no choice. All the children around the world need him. Can you imagine a world without Santa Claus? Can l have some time with Santa alone? Sure. Come on, Santa. We're supposed to be best friends for all eternity. - Santa Claus! - Look, it's Santa. Come on, stand up. Come on, come on. We have to get back to the North Pole at once. Only the Great Christmas Icicle can save Paws now. Eli, do we have the reindeer? They should be here any minute, sir. Whoa! Right here. Good, guys, great job. Whoa! We got a few odd looks in traffic, but, hey, that's New York. Thank goodness you're all right, Santa. We have to get Paws to the Great Christmas Icicle right away. We're ready to fly, SC! Hang on, Paws. We'll be home soon. All right, let's get back to the North Pole and fast! - Goodbye! - Bye, Santa! - Goodbye Santa. - Get better, Paws! Oh, goodness. l was afraid of this. With Christmas coming so soon, the Icicle just doesn't have enough magic to spare. l never thought l'd have such a friend. What's happening? Paws? Paws, you're back! But how? lt was your love for each other and Christmas magic! Santa, what happened to me? You're no longer a pup. From now on your name will be Santa Paws! Now we really can be best friends for all eternity, Santa Claus. Please, come in! l'm Mrs Gibson. Thank goodness you girls are OK! We're really good, actually. l'll never forget you. And we'll never forget you. You know, they need a home. - Honey? Yeah. - Really? l think that is the greatest Christmas present l could ever imagine. - You wanna go home with us? - Yes!
