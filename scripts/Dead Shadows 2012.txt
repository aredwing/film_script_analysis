Is what saved? Why did you go to the sanctuary? Are you crazy? Excuse me, please. What do you see on the screen? Hello, Miss? Good day, Technical Service DC, How may I be of assistance? An issue the LAN Wireless or Ethernet? True, this is not the solution, sir. First, go back a step. Have you tried restarting? Please try that. It's interrupted from the phone login.

Your shoes, your bike helmet fucking! Fuck! Do not want you here, get out! Tonight I will rest, if any problems arise, Jeremy will you call him. - O Superman - No more bullshit! Boss wants to do a review of the branches... Because the passage of the comet can create a kind of magnetic interference. He wants to check all bookings. Glitch? Are you kidding? It's not even passing near us. Just follow the instructions, okay? I don't give a shit about the comet, only about getting new customers. Superman said "you go to hell". You best tell yourself. Tell you, do not worry. I am right in front of the Eiffel Tower ... Where, from morning thousands of people... ... who came to this site privileged to get the best possible location... ... to observe the passage of the comet. There are still several questions that concern all of us here... Regarding the possible consequences of the comet... Signifying the end of the world was it sent from heaven above? This Comet awakens the deepest fears... So, today I will try to reveal to people that have plans for tonight. Some just want to see their families, with the passing of the comet. Others, on the contrary, want to enjoy with friends. Everyone take note, especially anybody planing criminal activity... ... that the police are take security measures, so remain vigilant and Take care. With me is Professor Dunant. Thanks for coming, Professor. - Hi, thanks for having me. - You're welcome. How far away from us is the comet? As the comet, opinions differ... However, French experts believe... ... The comet will pass very close to Earth. The Americans they say it could penetrate our atmosphere... Still, however we will be on alert. Many people worry about the consequences, what should we expect? Obviously a collision of this magnitude... ... With a celestial body of this size, certainly will not be without consequences. Everything else is pure speculation. = = In the last few days in Paris, we had enough wind ... ...What could signal an impending natural disaster ... ...Like a Tsunami. Do we have to prepare for it? No, there should not be a cataclysm such as the Tsunami, we do not consider it so. However, radio frequency and mobile communication ... ... This will Surely suffer intermittent interference. Exact scope interference can not yet be estimated. - Got a problem? - No, I'm in a hurry. I'm sure i've never seen you around here. If you want to have some fun? We have what you need. You got something... Am I right? - How much you got? - Nothing, sorry. No problem. I believe you. But anyway I will check you . Leave! Johnny. Are you still here? Back from Canada? already Santito! I've warned you lot about doing business in my area ! Were just having fun with our new friend, Johnny. Not Johnny, It's John, motherfucker! You do not want the role of protector. What do you do? First, you are only four. Four, if you count the asshole behind your back. Second, today I'm really cranky and third... Why? Are you bragging? Are you going to tell us about that new toy? Yes, sort of. Now get out of here. I've heard. Get out. Thanks. You saved me... I did!, Who cares? Come here, honey! Come on! Come here! Out of there! Come on! Come here, dear. Come on, honey. Come here. Come on... I knew it! Go back... That glow of fire in the sky. It has come here again. - But for revenge! - Why do you never shut up? Right? I remember when they came here the first time. It was a tough fight, believe me. When was it 1986? Yes, it was in 1986. My friend Edmond was still alive. Witnessing their arrival. It was horrible! But we fought. Yes, both of us fought like rabid dogs! Edmond was as skilled Marcel Cerdan and I... ...Had my steel stick. I put it in their asses! But not enough, not... Now they're back. Damn! They want more. I understand Roger... You protect us from the Chinese, and Communist Martians... But you're scaring my customers, Do you understand? What customers? - There's no one here! - Are here saying that shit. Hey, nothing happens. Do not worry, it's just Roger, our Local maniac. We're used to it, he's become our little pet. Are you okay, sir? Very kind of you to ask. Do not worry about me. Worry about yourself and others. If you ever need help, call me. I'm Still in shape! Go bother my competition and send me some customers to the store. Go for a walk or take some shower . You must be kidding. Seriously? Soft?? Juice? I do not know, it's... strange. Maybe we tonight could go to club, Right? A good drink can open a man up to a new perspective... ...And allow you to see things more clearly , do not you think? Good refined alcohol. Like the vodka. Or maybe the tequila, Tequila Gold Have you tried it? You can feel how it flows through your throat... Then feel how warm you from the inside. And you will want to drink more... Dance, laugh, rock you... Wanting someone to pet... Having her in your arms... But some prefer beer or wine. Personally I think it's very sexy. What the hell is going on? Do you think I'm sexy or not? Want to fuck me? Is there anybody home? Hello. Sorry, the door was open. The door was open, thought maybe someone broke in here. Sorry... Don't worry. It happened after throwing that bastard out. I'll Be ready in a moment. Sit . I'm finishing a painting. It's called "Orgasmic Explosion". Do you paint? - No. - Are you sure? - Of course. - Maybe you have talent. - I would have known. So you broke in here? - No, the door was open... - Yes You were spying. I knew it. See that discussion with my ex, right? You noticed. Or am I wrong? Yes, I heard and saw you talking. I've also spied. It's exciting to see someone argue. - And What did you think? Was I convincing? - Convincing? Yes a desperate girl who cheated on his boyfriend. - Do you mean...? - Only joking, yes. I wanted to break up with him before. He spent all day on the computer playing games . - Yeah, I know... - Really? A beer? I'm out of beer, but this is better. - Guess I'd better... - No, stay. You're having three shots? And now a toast. For world peace. Well, here's to you, from me... ...As for peace, for having known... ...And by the end of the world. Why not Together, we can watch the passage of the comet ? No, I'll probably be in bed. - Are not you interested? - Not at all. - Personally, I love these things. - What do you mean? All the strange things that nobody understands. It's very exciting. A huge stone passes over our heads... A comet. This is no kite. Stones do not fly at 60 km per second. 60 km per second? How do you know? - I saw it on the news. - Oh, what, you know everything? Every time a comet passes say they all die. Not a bad end. In any case, the Incas... ...Or Mayans predicted it many years ago. All these cheap preachers and gurus say that, "we're going to die." Yes, just like that guy in the shop... He spoke about an invasion or something. He was convinced, it was very strange. It was pretty scary. So... You don't fear the comet? Right? Me? No. Then you're going to protect me, right? Sure, no problem. I'm kind of exterminator of space monsters. - What's your name? - Chris. I deliberately left the door open. The result was that you came. Really? I seen and wanted to meet you. It was a good plan. No, I'm kidding. The Open Door was an oversight. A happy carelessness. Tonight there will Apocalyptic Party. Will you come with me? - Me? - No, not you. your twin brother. - I do not know, do you know anyone... - You will you be my partner? I'll wear a white dress and glass slippers ... ...That blends perfectly with the end of the world. Come on, it'll be fun. Okay. Well, I'm Claire. No, she does not think I'm a loser. There was Accident today on the Champs Elysees. Several people were injured. An unknown driver hit... ... several vehicles and some pedestrians... then crashed into a store. The police and paramedics... ... Are already in place. Initial reports... ... 15 people injured, three of them gravely. And how will the comet cause unrest in suburban Paris From early morning... ... there has been so much theft, & robberies, assaults and suicides. While police are increasing security measures... ... First reports are now exceeding expectations. Military intervention would be too problematic. Interior Minister advises residents to stay at home... ... avoid crowds. CALL: THE APOCALYPSE IS AT MY DOOR... COME AND SAVE ME! CLAIRE. Hey, you! Pardon my interruption. Are you familiar with astronomy? - Yes - Maybe you can help. Please... Okay! Look, Hugo! This kind gentleman Spotted the comet. Thanks. Tell me, how did you do it? Is this your profession? Are you astronaut, pilot or something? No, I learned from my father. He loved the stars.

Something like those two? No pointing at people like that, Hugo. Okay? I have an idea. Try to find the Big Dipper and the North Star, okay? Do it. - One more thing... - Yes? The boy is right. It's a fantastic night... ...For dinner with someone nice and then... - Dad, I found the Big Dipper! - Really? Yes, good job! It's Beautiful. You know what? When looking at the stars... ...We realize how infinitely small we are in comparison to the universe. The sky is huge. Is it not beautiful? Look at the stars! Hello. You look like you need a drink. What's this? It will help you look into the eyes of the Apocalypse . I'm not talking about the party, I mean the end of the world. Do you know anyone here? You look a little lost. I'm looking for a friend, Claire. - Claire? - Yes - I! - Really? No, it's a joke. I'm Laura. But you can call me Claire. If you like. Is she your girlfriend? Is she nice?

Need a glass of water or a bit of fresh air? I need lights, lots of lights... Light? Maybe in the bathroom. Better? I thought I should help. Not a problem... Quite the contrary. Since I'm here, I'll go to the bathroom. Otherwise, the end of the world will arrive before I go. So you're here. For a hero you're pretty slow. I'm sorry. Did you miss me? Guess? I'm not here for the comet. That show. Yes, very impressive. You want a drink? - Do you want to get drunk? - Very funny. No I felt bad after the first cocktail. Really?
