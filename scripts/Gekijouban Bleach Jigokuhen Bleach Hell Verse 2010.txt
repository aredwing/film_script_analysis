Look at that, you guys! Tell me, what do you see? Either one of you! Uh... it's a memorial to a kid who was killed here the other day. Correct! So why is the vase knocked over? Because we thought it'd be fun to knock it over? Correct! Then you have to apologize to this guy. This guy? Meaning... uh... Umm... Just apologize! - We're sorry. Please forgive us! - We're sorry. Please forgive us! Thank you... It's all right now. You must've been scared... after what they did to the flowers your mom and dad brought for you. You know about that? Yeah. I know how much they cared for you. That's why you can't leave here, right? Yeah. But you can't stay here forever. Because I'll be taken to Hell? It's not that. Your mom and dad won't be able to find closure. Oh... That's why you have to pass over to the other side and go to the Soul Society. All right. Then I'll go after I see Mom and Dad's faces one last time. Yeah. KUROSAKI CLINIC KUROSAKI CLINIC Good mornin'! Ichigo! Quit bugging me! For crying out loud. Son, you've gotten stronger. But! However! Why'd you slam me down instead of accepting me?! How can we bond like men if you're like that?! Okay, let's try that again! Cut it out! Here, Big Brother. Thank you, Yuzu. Dad, you'd better eat quickly too, or you'll be late. What? Is he going somewhere? An overnight seminar, he says. I know you'll miss me, but I'll bring something home, so you're in charge of your younger sisters, Ichigo. Mom, I won't be long, okay? Stop it already with the photo. Well then... I'll be on my way. Have a good time. Brother, what do you want for dinner tonight? Huh? Dad's not here, so I'll make what you like. Anything will do. Oh, come on... Ichi! Now's your chance. Make a request! Oh... Okay, then curry will do. Huh? That's no different than usual. Then I'd like curry, too. Huh? I'm quite able to make something fancier... That's true, but your curry is really tasty, Yuzu, and I wanted to eat it. Huh? Where'd he go? Ichigo. Huh? Rukia! Renji! Yo. When did you guys come over to this side? Just a little while ago. You should've told me you were coming. Sorry. It was urgent. But never mind us. What're you doing here? Oh, I brought flowers for the spirit that was here... But it looks like he crossed over by himself. What's the matter with you?! It's your job to help wandering spirits cross over! You lost sight of him? It'll be your fault if he becomes a Hollow. Huh?! What do you mean "my job"?! It's supposed to be you Soul Reapers' job! I'm just a Substitute Soul Reaper! What? Damn, you! You wanna fight? Stop it! You morons! You guys are always... Oww... We didn't come to Karakura Town to play around. I get it. Mission first, right? Mission? What're you talking about? It's nothing we need your help with. But if it has to do with something on this side... I said we can handle it! Brother told me to keep you from poking your nose into our work so that you wouldn't get big-headed. Damn! Byakuya, that bastard... That's how it goes. If we find that wandering spirit, we'll make sure he crosses over. You just concentrate on your studies. Yeah, I get it. - 'Morning! - Hi, You're here early. Not really. You always barely make it in time. Kurosaki. 'Morning! Oh, 'morning. Tatsuki's not with you this morning? Tatsuki says she has morning practice. Man, that sure scared me. It's amazing no one was injured. Are you sure you're not hurt? Chad, you're awesome. What are you made of? Ichigo! Are you listening?! Huh? Sorry, I wasn't listening. That's okay. It wasn't anything important anyway. Hold on! That's what I was going to say. It's up to me to decide if what I say is important or not. Okay, okay. So, which is it? Are you really willing to listen? Don't answer my question with a question. I don't sense any especially unusual Spiritual Pressure. That was an odd way for that to collapse, though. Was it merely a natural phenomenon? I wouldn't say that. Do you sense something? Yeah... It's very minimal, but it's still here. But it's nothing like I've sensed before. What's that mean? I don't know... It's not a Hollow or a spirit. And it's not a human with special powers, like Sado or Inoue. Morever, it's not a Soul Reaper either. Anyway, it seems certain that something is going on. What the...?! That Spiritual Pressure... ...came from the direction of Ichigo's school! Why Ichigo's? Wait! There's another odd presence... Yeah... Renji, you go to the school. I'll check out the other one. Got it. Be careful. I will. Tatsuki! - Hey! Pull yourself together! - Hey! Are you all right?! Tatsuki! Tatsuki! Get ahold of yourself! Hey! Ichigo Kurosaki... You know my name. Who is this guy? Inoue, take care of Tatsuki and the others! Okay! This guy... He took Kurosaki's Getsuga and didn't even flinch. In that case... Bankai! Tensa Zangetsu! Okay... You're not getting away! He had others with him?! What took you guys so long?! Who are these guys? This Spiritual Pressure is the one I sensed earlier. Let's do this! Delicious. He absorbed the reishi! Back at you. Ishida! El Directo! Damn! What's with their Spiritual Pressure? You suck. Still want more? Roar! Zabimaru! Renji! Are you okay, Ichigo? Y-Yeah, more or less... Oh my, Soul Reapers are here. How troublesome. It's them. You know them? Yeah. Looks like we have a mess on our hands. You probably didn't notice because you were caught up with these guys, but another similar presence appeared a minute ago. What?! It happened at Kurosaki Clinic... at your house. Rukia's headed there alone, but it's likely that... Yuzu and Karin are in danger! Ichigo! Let us handle it here! Got it! Where're you going? Roar! Zabimaru! Darn! He got away. What?! You're mine! Damn! What're you doing?! Hurry and put on your hood! Oh no! What the...?! Those are... the Gates of Hell! No! Please don't! Help me! What just happened? Let's get out of here! Wait! Let those girls go! Strong words from someone in your condition. Gunjo, hurry up and get rid of her. Yes sir, Lord Shuren. Since we don't have time to waste! Hado Number 33: Sokatsui! Ichigo! Yuzu! Karin! What're you bastards planning to do with Yuzu and Karin?! Looks like Taikon and the others messed it up. That's okay. It's all the same anyway. Ichigo Kurosaki, come with us. What? We need you to do something for us. Stop talking nonsense! Return Yuzu and Karin! That won't be possible... Then I'll take them back by force! Gunjo, go on back ahead of me. What the...?! Ichigo! You live up to your reputation, Ichigo Kurosaki. That's why you're the man we want. I'm sure I struck him, but he... Yuzu! Karin! Stop it! I won't let you pass! Yuzu! Karin! Karin! Who are you?! Does it matter? You're... We weren't expecting you to sneak up like that... I don't like watching you people have your way. Why you...! Let that girl go! He's fast! Forget it! Back off! Understood! Wait! Ichigo! Hey! Look after this girl. Yuzu! Oh no! What the...?! That chain. Could it be...?! Want more? You... Give Yuzu back! What?! Karin! Rukia! Sado! Sado! Sado! Damn! Ichigo Kurosaki! We are Sinners trapped in Hell. If you want your sister back, lend us a hand. You... Show yourselves! We have but one wish: To be released from Hell. To do that, we need your help. There! Destroy the Gates of Hell, Ichigo Kurosaki. Do that, and we will return your sister. Hey you! Do you know about those guys?! Who are those guys in the black hoods?! Where did they take Yuzu?! What are the Gates of Hell?! Hold on, hold on... Don't barrage me with questions. Hurry up and answer! Stop it, Ichigo. Rukia... Calm down. Healing everyone comes first. What are you? That chain... That is a chain from Hell, isn't it? What?! That's right. My name is Kokuto. As you can see, I am a Sinner. So you're like those guys in the black hoods? That's right. Why is a Sinner helping us? Helping? You have it wrong. I wasn't helping you people. I just don't like those guys. I don't give a damn about that! If you're a Sinner, you know how to get to Hell, don't you?! Then take me there! If I don't go, Yuzu will... Be killed, probably. The atmosphere in Hell is a deadly poison to ordinary people. If you don't rescue her quickly, your sister will die. You Soul Reapers must have at least heard... what it's like in Hell. Yes... Hell is... ...where the souls of those who cannot go to the Soul Society, the home of souls, because of heinous acts committed during their lifetime, are sent. Those who are sent to Hell are Sinners, bound by chains and condemned for their sins by the guards for all eternity. In a word, no ordinary person could survive Hell. Do you still want to go? Damn right! I can't leave Yuzu by herself in a place like that! I see. If you're ready... I'd be willing to take you there. But only because I want to defeat those guys. You'll be a worthwhile fighting asset. What's your problem with them? Didn't I tell you? I don't like them. People I don't like are my enemies. That's how it goes in Hell. The fact that you were sent to Hell means you did something heinous to deserve that, right? What I did certainly was deserving of getting sent to Hell. But there are times when a person has to sell his heart to darkness for the things... he cherishes. Now then, shall we get on our way to Hell? Yeah. Wait, Ichigo. Are you really going to trust this guy we know nothing about? What he is doesn't matter! I'm going to rescue Yuzu! To do that, I need this guy's help! Even if what he says is true! Your going there would be exactly what those guys want! I know. But I have to go! Then we'll go with you. Rukia... Okay... Then get yourselves ready. I'm going to open the Gates of Hell right now. Renji, if worse comes to worst, you know what to do. Yeah... When that happens, I'll use that to forcibly pull you guys out. Thanks for doing this. Don't mention it. Lord Shuren. It appears they've entered Hell. I see. Is Murakumo back yet? No. He was run through by a Kushanada's blade and plunged into the depths of Hell. It will take considerable time for him to return. That moron. Then you take Taikon and Garogai with you. Yes, sir. Come to me, Ichigo Kurosaki. With your powers, we will gain our freedom. Welcome to Hell. This is the entrance to Hell. It's a lot different than I imagined. Is it your first time, too? Don't Soul Reapers manage Hell? We don't manage. We oversee. Ordinarily, anything to do with Hell is strictly prohibited. The air in this place sucks. It'd be hard for someone with weak Spiritual Pressure to keep from going crazy. Yuzu... I'll be right there. Kokuto! Their hideout is much deeper inside Hell. Let's run. Yuzu! What are they? Are they humans? They're Sinners, as well. But they've given up fighting. Given up fighting? Yeah... Why do you think Sinners in Hell possess the ability to fight? It's so that they can fight back against Hell's guards and know how powerless they are. No matter how hard Sinners train, they're no match for the guards. With their hopes crushed, they are given endless suffering and become mindless Sinners! Despite that, we continue to resist. Hatred is the source of our power. Here in Hell, it's proof that we are who we are. Looks like someone's noticed you're here. What is that?! That's one of Hell's guards, Kushanada. That is?! It and its kind capture Sinners like us, stomp us down, and devour us. If they eat you, wouldn't you die? No. Even we're eaten, we come back to life. Here in Hell, we Sinners are repeatedly devoured and come back to life. Until our spirits are broken. Be careful! It's the same for you, as well. Once you're killed, you'll be bound in chains and never be able to leave here. How many of them are there?! We'll charge and break through their ranks! Roar! Zabimaru! Dance! Sodenoshirayuki! Licht Wind. Here goes! Bankai! Getsuga... W-What?! ...tensho! Idiot! At least give us some warning if you are going to Hollowfy! What were you thinking? We were that close to getting caught in that. Uh, yeah... Sorry. What happened? I didn't do anything. The mask appeared on its own. What? Was that a Hollow power just now? It was. Then the atmosphere here in Hell must've reacted to it. The air here summons hidden powers. If you let your guard down, the power within you will go out of control. We have to hurry! Hey! What's wrong, Ishida? I know what Kurosaki's like when he's out of control. If what he just said is true... Hell is too risky a place for Kurosaki. Hey! There's no path! Never mind, jump! What is this place? The graveyard for those things we saw earlier, perhaps? Where's Yuzu?! She's not here. You! Give back Yuzu! Sure, you can have her back. Here. That is, if you people cooperate with us. Don't be ridiculous! We'll finally be able to take off these uncomfortable hoods! I'm Taikon. Nice to meet you. My name is Gunjo. Garogai... free... How frivolous. You uninvited ones, please leave. Give back Yuzu! Too slow! Roar! Zabimaru! Delicious. Take this! Hado Number 33: Sokatsui! Delish! Careful! Their powers without their hoods are head and shoulders above what they were like in the World of the Living! What?! Jump! Tsuginomai, Hakuren! Ichigo! Getsuga... ...tensho! Ichigo, your sister's up ahead. What?! In that case, leave this place to us. Get going! Actually, you're getting in our way. What?! Forget it. Let Renji and Ishida handle things here. Let's get moving! Got it! Let's go, Rukia! Kokuto! No, you don't! I can't catch up with them now... Oh? You're going to take me on? You must really have a death wish. I wonder about that. My pride as a Quincy won't let me lose twice to the same adversary. Bankai! I'm returning what you did to us in the World of the Living... in spades! What is this place? Once we're through here, we'll get to the place they're using as their hideout. Yuzu is... beyond here. Now's our chance. The fact that your friends are keeping the enemy occupied means fewer of them are at the hideout, and that's good for us. Look out! Crap... Are you all right, Kokuto?! This is... nothing... What about you? Are you okay with that showing? Yeah, I've gotten quite used to it. Hang on, I'll fix that... Leave me alone! Here in Hell, we're always together with this pain. Never mind me. You need to think only of rescuing your sister. Why're you so concerned about my sister? Before we came here, you mentioned you sold your heart to darkness for the sake of something you cherished. By any chance, was that thing you cherished...? Yeah... I had a younger sister, too. But my sister died because I was a good-for-nothing older brother. That's why I abandoned everything... for her sake. Ichigo, you have to save your sister. Don't let her go through what my sister had to! But... coming from a guy who went to Hell for doing what no human being should do, it must not sound very convincing. Kokuto... Let's hurry, Ichigo. If we don't hurry, we'd let down your friends who are holding the enemy back. Right... This won't work! I'm not done yet! Hikotsu Taiho! Damn! You'll pay... Was it that yellow water? It's working! In that case, one more time! You're next! It's over. It's over for you! Higazekko! Don't ever underestimate Zabimaru. You're wasting your time. That was tasty. Yum. It's got a slightly unusual flavor, but it doesn't bother me. Stop your useless resistance. Let me give you the kiss of death. No, thank you! I told you, you're wasting your time! Not yet! Oh, come on! Haven't you had enough? Was that your last resort? You're not as bright as I expected. Say that after you take this. This is the last. You're wasting, wasting your time, I said! What? Huh?! Geldschrank. It creates a barrier identical to that of Sprenger by surrounding an adversary with high-density reishi. But I should have sucked up all of your reishi. Why am I in here?! I helped myself to yours. Huh? Huh?! What? What?! I created a tiny wound with Seeleschneider from which reishi is gushing out from your reishi tank of a body. You don't have a monopoly on absorbing reishi and turning it into a weapon. Quincies are much better... at it! D-Dam... mit! Taikon! Now! Looks like Taikon and Garogai bit the dust. It's a bit different than I had planned, but this is still acceptable. Please die. A lovely voice. Now then, I'll adjust for time, and the others... S-Sannomai... Shirafune. Kuchiki! I barely made it... You fight better than I expected. Actually, I intended to take you people down with me. But that's all right. Dying here was the whole idea, anyway. What?! What're you talking about?! I can't tell you that. What's with these guys? You okay? Thanks. Watch your step. Yeah. What is this sand? I sense a strange Spiritual Pressure. This isn't ordinary sand. It's composed of the crushed bones of Sinners. What?! Repeatedly crushed by the Kushanada, their spirits are broken... Until finally, their bodies crumble apart... burned completely by the flames of Hell. This desert is what becomes of Sinners in the end. No matter how far you go, there is no freedom in Hell. No freedom? But you people came out to Karakura Town, didn't you? Kushanada's reach extends there, as well. Help me! In the end, we cannot escape. Here, tormented by agony that may never end, we struggle... and crumble away. Look, Ichigo... If you get your sister back, would you do me just one favor? What is it? Free me from Hell. I want to be reborn. Reborn so I can see my sister again. I want to see her and apologize. All right. If it's within my power... Thanks. Let's move quickly! It's beyond that hill. Yuzu... Yuzu...! Yuzu! You did well to get here, Ichigo Kurosaki. Give back Yuzu! My name is Shuren. Are you aware? If you want to save your sister's life, you have no choice but to do as I say. Are you going to take on the two of us by yourself? I'm not alone. Sinners cannot die in Hell. Kokuto! You know what that means, don't you? No! Taikon! Gunjo! Garogai! They went to separate you from your friends, then willingly died so they could return here. That's impossible! Even if that's so, how could they return so quickly? What you believe isn't everything! Kokuto! Go and rescue your sister! Don't worry about me! Oh my... A Sinner playing friends with a human? Kokuto! I will keep you company. Isn't it about time you do as I say?! Shut up! What the...?! Yuzu?! There's no way you can win now. Shut up! The same goes for you! It can't be...! What?! It's over! Kokuto! Damn! What're you looking at? I'm your opponent! I don't have time to keep messing with you! Getsugatensho! Wonderful! That power! Use that power to destroy the Gates of Hell! Shut up! A wise decision. It seems you aren't so agitated that you do realize what would happen if you continued that attack! I won't deal you a mortal blow. Excellent! Now destroy the Gates! Yuzu... I'm coming to rescue you now! Are you all right, Ichigo? That's enough. This wound is nothing. How.? How what? I did the same thing they did... Like I said... Here, you're reborn immediately even if you die. You're a pain in the ass! Just stay dead for a while! Did you double-cross? Double-cross who? Everything went as I planned. I'm just having you and them cooperate with me. Now... Hollowfy yourself and help me out. You promised, right? That story... about your sister... That was true. My sister was murdered. That's why I gave the guys who murdered her a slow and painful death. That's enough of that! For a moment, it felt really good. But it won't bring my dead sister back! No matter how hard I hope, that will never happen. That's why I decided to make everybody feel what I feel! Is that any reason why... I had to be sent to Hell? I tried many times to escape from here. But each time, Kushanada crushed me and dragged me back to the depths of Hell. But that's when I realized... Many different hopes find their way to the shit heap. Like... that form you took. That's why I passed on that information to the guys in Hell. I'll do anything it takes to get out of here. If it takes turning the World of the Living into Hell, I don't give a damn. Ichigo! What's wrong? So you are with them, after all. Wrong. It'll take more than this to cut these chains. Ishida! Rukia! I... chi... Rukia! What?! That's it! Unleash the power of hatred! Give yourself to your anger and cut these chains! Still not enough! Unless you turn into a monster, you can't defeat me! Look at this! Looks like your sister's body couldn't withstand the atmosphere in Hell. You see, chains are forming. That's it, get angry. This is Hell. Compassion is unnecessary. Bury your heart in darkness! I... chigo... Welcome to Hell. That's it! Use that power to cut my chains! Cut them! Shuren and the others believed that if they made you destroy the Gates, they would be released from Hell, but they were wrong. It is these chains that bind Sinners. Just a little more. Cut all the chains that bind me! Now, this is the last one! Don't let him provoke you... with his crap! Ichigo! Go back to the World of the Living! What?! Serves you right. Dam... mit! The efflux from the destroyed Gates of Hell is being brought under control by the Kido Corps. What's the effect on Karakura Town? At the moment, none. All right, understood. Continue to direct efforts to quickly put up a barrier. Yes, sir. But who'd have expected those Gates to collapse just one day after a crack appeared... We definitely know that Kuchiki and Lieutenant Abarai, who were dispatched to investigate, and Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo entered Hell. For crying out loud... Reporting. We have Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki who emerged from the Gates of Hell in custody. Damn you! Out of my way! I have to... take Yuzu with me! Calm down. We've summoned the rescue team. I can't wait for them! Restrain him! Let me go! Damn you! Yuzu's... Yuzu is...! If I don't do something... Ichigo Kurosaki. Old Man... Excuse me. Kurosaki! Inoue! Yuzu is... Please help Yuzu! I know. Hang in there, Yuzu! Yuzu! What is this? Yuzu! Why?! Inoue... Hey, Inoue! What's the matter? Please, do something! It's no use! She's already been pierced by the Chains of Hell. She has become one of them. Our powers can't help her. That... That can't be! You caused all of this. Yuzu! It appears you went into Hell on your own and made the problem worse. The demon inside of you cut the Chains of Hell that were considered absolutely uncuttable. In effect, it means that this world will turn into Hell. Your selfish actions have exposed all humans to danger! I'm coming in. Byakuya... Ichigo Kurosaki. Why won't you look me in the eyes? I left Rukia... Renji... Ishida... I left them all behind and came back. And worse, Yuzu is... I've wronged everyone... What of it? Byakuya... Rukia, your younger sister, is trapped in Hell! To let me escape, they... Rukia is a proud Soul Reaper. She was prepared for the consequences of her actions. If they all helped you alone to escape, then I suggest you give thought to the meaning of that. Sorry to bother you. Yuzu! Yuzu! Yuzu! Yuzu! Hey! Yuzu! What happened, sir? Go inside. Right! If they all helped you alone to escape, then I suggest you give thought to the meaning of that. Inoue, how's Yuzu? She looks like she's stabilized a bit. Thanks. Not at all. You should thank everyone. Where's Chad? How's Chad doing? He hasn't regained consciousness yet. But don't worry. It'll take time, but I'll see to him. I see. Thanks... I mean, really. You must be exhausted. Want something to drink? Kurosaki... Huh? Are you going back once more? Yuzu was swallowed up by Hell, but she's back with us, alive. I should be able to rescue Rukia and the others, as well. But if you go back again... I know. If I go back and my Hollow state goes out of control, I might destroy the world this time. The old man is right. But this time, I won't lose control. That guy's strong. No one could hold a candle to him. I can't say that I could beat him without becoming a Hollow... But... I have to defeat him! If I don't, I can't face those who entrusted their lives to me! Make sure... you come back. I will. I'll be going now. Reporting. Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki, who had been under house arrest, destroyed the barrier and is headed this way. Ichigo is...? That bastard... Ukitake! Repairing the Gates takes priority. Understood. I'll take care of Kurosaki... What's the big idea, Kurosaki?! Are you going for revenge? If so, then all the more reason why I cannot let you go. If you should lose control again, this time it will mean... Bankai... I'm going only to rescue my friends. Kurosaki... What now? Defensive positions! Don't allow Kushanada into the World of the Living! Oh! There goes Ichigo! Let him go! We don't have time to bother with him. So you've come to me. Ichigo! I considered going to get you. But imagine that... you came from your side to me. Is it to avenge your sister? Yuzu's all right. That's a surprise. Then why did you come back? I came... to rescue my friends. To rescue them... You still don't understand this place, do you? They are trapped by the Chains of Hell. Look! Ishida! Renji! The men are still rotting. Not so fast! But the little Soul Reaper woman is just about ripe. Rukia! Ichigo, why...? Hell works in a simple manner. Those who are trapped here come back to life any number of times. But as long as they don't cut their chains, they will never be able to leave here. Then all I have to do is cut the chains. How gallant. Then you'll cut my chains as well, will you not? That, I can't do. You... I'm going to defeat. You're a fool! Do you seriously think you can beat me without your mask?! You're being nave! No matter what your hopes are for challenging me, nothing will work against me the way you are now! Getsugatensho! That's it! Ichigo...! What's the matter? What're you afraid of? Is it because an unfamiliar side of you might destroy everything? In that case, you shouldn't have come all the way here! Your sister was saved because you were able to turn into that monster. Without that, you can't do anything! Didn't I tell you? Only one thing sees you through those times when your hopes aren't answered. That thing is hatred. My desire for revenge was the only thing that made me strong. What's the matter? Hate me more! It will make you strong too. Would you rather I kidnap your sister once more? That's it... Good. Your body's lost control before. The second time should be easy. You can never escape that monster. Hopes alone won't accomplish anything! Ichigo... Ichigo! Keep it down! This is where it begins. Hear that, Ichigo? The Kushanada have sensed that your Spiritual Pressure has changed. They'll be here soon to devour you, the one who destroyed Hell. Hurry, Ichigo, become a monster. Or do you want to be devoured? It doesn't matter, really. Here, you'll come right back to life. The cycle will repeat endlessly until you crush Hell! Well? What's the matter? Ain't gonna happen... I'm not doing it. Revenge for hopes that aren't answered... That's bullshit. That's simply blaming your own suffering... on those around you. All you're doing is running from your pain by taking revenge! I want to save my friends. But... I won't sacrifice those around me for it. Ichigo, get away! Ichigo! I fight with that solemn vow... in my soul! Ichigo! Ichigo! You lost control, after all. Good. Now destroy them! What? What is that form?! What did you do? Kokuto... Did your sister want you to take revenge? What? Did she want you to keep repeating this cycle of kill and be killed? You cannot sever hatred with hatred. You're dragging your sister into endless hatred. What my friends want me to do is not revenge. They want me to stop you! Can you see it? Hell is clinging to me. Hell is even willing to borrow the help of an outsider to keep you from escaping. Hell lending a hand to a human, you say? That's impossible! You and I are the same! That's right. I am just a lone human being like yourself. And I am an older brother. My chains... I'm free. This means... I'm free at last! What the...?! Stop it! I... Those chains are your punishment for deceiving Hell! Kokuto! Repent your sins once more in the depths of Hell! I did it. I did it... Ichigo... You did it. Now we have to find Ishida and Renji. Yeah! Right. I cut their chains just a while ago. Where are they? We're right here! My whole body's sore! Mine, too. It feels as hard as a rock. You were rotting away. What do you expect? Rotting? What do you mean? Nothing... Looks like it's all over. What happened to that guy? He was dragged to the depths of Hell. I guess that means you won... What's with your form?! Oh... this? I don't really understand it, either. They helped me, I think. Do I look weird? It goes way beyond weird. It's the power of Hell. That's just the way it is with you. All sorts of things cling to you. Hurry up and change back! I hear you. I'll do it now. Wait, Ichigo. If you undo it, they might attack you again... Huh? See? Even if it's the end of the world, as long as I'm on track, I'm not alone in my desire to protect. It's starting to feel more natural, letting go of all my restrictions and to go all out. My boiling determination and burning passion has made me exceed my limits with ease. How far can I chase the winds kindled by the ages? Even if it's to the ends of the world, as long as I'm on track, I don't need supportive words as I head out because the future will fuel my dreams to keep running. Especially now, since I'm not alone in my desire to protect. I threw in all the sin and pain into this unrefillable soul. If it's going to fall apart when I reach my goal, I want to leave fragments of it behind. How can I aim for the distance, if I can't confront my fears? Even if it's a single ray of hope, I'll ignite it and gather the light into my outstretched hands. I won't let it end as a dream just for today. Especially now, when there's more than one bond to protect. If this pounding heartbeat is to be a blazing chain then I'll only believe in this life tied to the moment. Even if it's to the ends of the world, as long as I'm on track, I don't need supportive words as I head out. Even if it's a single ray of hope, I'll ignite it and gather the light into my outstretched hands. I won't let it end as a dream just for today. Especially now, when there's more than one bond to protect! Yuzu! Oh, 'morning, Karin... What's the matter? I'm so glad! W-What? I'm back! Hey... I bought lots of souvenir gifts! Hey, no one's home? Hey!
