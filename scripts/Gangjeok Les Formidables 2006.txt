You wanna run, too? See you, Mr. Hwang. What's your name? Ha Sung-woo. Homicide, Jongno Station. Remember that. Sure. God, she's a dog. Hey! Why? I'm done for the night. So drunk. He's insisting on you. Have a good time. Not too much. Su-hyun. Let's go. In a little bit. I don't wanna be here with you. - Hey! - Go ahead. - You said no sex. - What do you care? Whatever. He didn't even pay. Put it on me. A cop came? Let me take care of it. I'll call you. Where to? Where should we go? To Mexico. I like Brazil. Ghana. - Incheon, please. - Okay. Yes, Su-hyun. Let's take off. - I wanted to be a fisherman. - For real? A boat full of fish, drinking all night long. Liar! I wanted to see you once for all. Don't say that. I won't let you go again. Do you think I have any luck left? Let the past be forgotten. People will forget soon. You know Koreans forget so easily. Okay. Be strong. You're a brave boy. Okay, Dad. Don't worry about him. 'Until we meet again.' Fool! Sung-woo, you got a call. - Captain! - Hello? Where the fuck are you? Mi-rae called from Incheon. - Where about? - By the docks. He's up. - Let's go! - Lee Su-hyun. You're so going back to jail. She's still there? She keeps moving around in the area. Why did you wanna see me? Aren't you sick of me? Where do you stand in rank? At the bottom? What? Arrest me and get promoted. You're sick. Hang in there. You can't go back now. Until we get the real killer. - Who is it? - Hwang Jong-chae. You knew it, didn't you? So what? Is it that important? I'm giving up. I can't. It's him! Isn't that Sung-woo? - What? - I can't believe him! - Jesus! - What can we do? Let's wait and see. - Who the fuck are they? - Shit! Go after them! You fool! I gave you the chance! Stop it. Hwang, you coward! You wicked old fart! You raised them to be your dogs! Su-hyun. You're my son. You were a poor orphan living on the streets. I took in and turned you into a fine young man. Why do you desert me now? You ran from me. I didn't desert you. I can't be framed as a killer who killed his friend. Jae-phil was your favorite. But why? Why'd you kill him? Tell me! Tell me why you did it! You kids brought it upon yourselves. What? One who doesn't obey his father isn't worthy a life. We just wanted... to live our own lives! I'm the only one to decide that. Whether you live or die, it's my call. You get that now? Should we move in? What if they claim they caught the fugitive? It's Hwang Jong-chae. Take pictures. Now! - Fucking detective, Unbind one hand. - Yeah. - freeze, asshole! - Let go! Now! Motherfucker! What's the bustle? keep still! Motherfucker! keep still! You pigs are cocky only in swarms. It's him! He killed Choi! - Son of bitch - Fucker! Drop your weapons! Shoot him! Sung-woo, are you sure? You don't mind dying? It's okay. I wanted to die anyway. Shoot at the count of three. You, too! One, two. Three! No! No! Don't move! You can't die on me... Bro, Thanks. Shut up, asshole! Su-hyun. What is this? Where are you going? What are you doing? o arrest them. You bust Hwang Jong-chae. Here's evidence. I'll take your car. You know what? - What? - You're one crazy bastard. Hang in there. I'm okay. I know. It'd take a lot to kill you. Look who's talking. You still think that life is something? Sure. Dude! Okay, we'll live it out!
