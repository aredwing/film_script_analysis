And not just the kind you find in the liquor store or someone else's bed. I'm talking about temptation of the soul. Mm-hmm. The kind that just kinda, kinda... kinda creeps up on you without you even knowing it. - But God knows. - % God knows% God is that little voice inside that says, "Don't give in." % Don't give in% - Don't give up. - % Don't give up% Be gone, temptation!

I thought maybe you did. I was... hoping that he could make a difference, even if I can't. If you ask me, you did even better than he did. Really. I appreciate your support, honey. [Whispering] Father, forgive me. I'd like to talk to you about temptation. The kind that creeps up on you. [Narrating] And that's me, Jeremiah. Are you after Daddy's job already? Well, this is the story. My didn't-make-it-up story. - It was one week before Christmas. - Come on. The Christmas I learned all about miracles. I asked Santa Claus to bring me a brother for Christmas. Well, Santa doesn't make those kinds of deliveries, baby. Oh. Can Hakim have lunch with us? Well, I think Hakim's grandma might want him around today, you know? But he's my best friend. Well, maybe she won't miss him for a while. - But then you and I are going downtown, okay? - Okay. - Be careful crossing the street. - I will. - Look both ways. - Hakim! - [Henry] Don't wake his grandma. - Hakim! Come on, come on! Hurry up! All right! Let's play, Jeremiah! Okay. Let's build a snowman. Come on over here. Come on over here. - [Boys Laughing] - Huh!

Bad enough his mama ran out, but to leave him with his grandma. Bessie Adams can't take care of no five-year-old! You know that woman's two days older than dirt! Well, she won't have to much longer. - Child Welfare's gonna take him now. - What? Julia, they're closing the youth center today. I have to say good-bye to the kids. What is his problem? There is no problem, Ma. Yeah, and I'm the Queen of the Nile! Julia, something's been going on in this house for months now. I can hear it in your voice over the phone. - Mom, maybe you've been dialing the wrong number. - Oh, yeah? Well, somebody just better get their house in order. That's all I know. - Well, don't look at me, Ma, okay? - I'm lookin' at you! All right. Well, Mama, you can look at me from behind. Girl, don't be talkin' to me about your behind. I gave you that behind! I don't even know why I bother wearing this. It's not doing anyone any good. And neither am I. [Boys Chattering Outside] Lord... I know You're especially busy this time of year, but... I'm just a little tired. If You get a moment, I sure could use some help. - [Jeremiah] Mine's bigger! - [Hakim] Mine's bigger! - Mine's much bigger! - Mine's bigger! Why did you throw snow at me? It's all down my neck! [Coughing] [Dog Barking] Wow. - Huh? - Where'd you come from? You okay? No. You okay? No. Aaaaaaah! Hide, run, Hakim, run! - Wait a... Wait a minute! - Quick, hurry! - Here. Hide here. - I'm here!

It just means you've got to work that much harder... try that much harder to stay out of trouble. - I'm gonna do my thing. - Peace, man. - I'm sorry. - Where are we supposed to go now? - I don't know, man. - You did your best, pastor. Yeah, you tried. - Thank you, son. - Bye. - Y'all take care of yourselves. - What do you want to do? - I don't know. - Well, it's too cold to stay out. Tough break, huh? Kinda seems like they're all tough these days. You Henry Biggs? - Yes, I'm the pastor over at St. Matt's. - Bingo! Every Friday, 8:00. - My name's Dudley. - Nice to meet you, Dudley. - Pleasure. - You a reporter? - No. No, no. - Social worker? - No, I'm here in answer to your request. - My request? For help? Is this some kind of joke? Uh, no, no. He doesn't make jokes. He? Capital "H", capital "E". I want you to know that together the three of us... can help get you through this little crisis you're having. - Look, I don't know who you are. - Dudley, I'm Dudley. - Or who put you up to this. - He did. But I'm afraid you picked the wrong day for me to be a good sport. - Now, will you excuse me? - Sure. - Thank you. - Wow. I'm sorry. I'll, uh... try another approach. - Ho, ho, ho. - Thank you, sister. Merry Christmas. I've been waitin' a long time for this. - Yeah? - Yes, sir. Mmm. Oh, yeah. Hey, don't that cheese burn the roof of your mouth? Hmm? [Puffs] Um... [Gulps] [Puffing] Uh, you... you know Reverend Biggs? - Sure, from St. Matt's. - Yeah, that's the one. Stubborn, isn't he? Kinda short with people too. Didn't you notice? This man right here? Not that I know him that well. I'm just... - He came to the hospital every day after my wife's surgery. - Every day? He baptized all five of my kids. - All five of them? - Yeah. Give me this. - Wait. I didn't mean anything. - Go on, get on out of here! You better go. Get on outta here. And don't come back. I'm telling you, Mama, he was there. Like he fell from the sky. Then he did a dance and jumped around. Mommy's gonna stop giving you sugar cereal in the morning, baby. - Come on.

He dropped it. - Get against the wall. - I was returning a tape, man. I live right down the street. That was you. I saw you break my window! - I was at the ATM. - You have the right to remain silent. I have the receipt in my pocket! - [Siren Wailing] - [Chattering] Billy looked so sad. Why did they have him in handcuffs? He's not a criminal. Do you think they'll give him dinner? He hasn't had anything since lunch. - I know he's hungry. - He'll just be there overnight. His bail hearing will be set for sometime tomorrow. Has he ever been in trouble before? - Two years ago. - Oh, great! I was able to get the judge to give him probation, as long as I found him a job. - And you did. - I promised I would straighten him out. Looks like I didn't do such a good job. Oh, no. He's a different kid now. Watches the little ones while I'm at work. I don't know what I'm going to do if they take him away from me. - Don't worry. We'll talk tomorrow. - Thank you. - Bye. - Saul, Saul, Saul! Over here! Look, kids! We don't have to walk. Come on, kids. Come on, kids. - Henry. - Let's go. Watch your brother. No fingerprints on the windshield, if you please. Try to keep the feet off the seats, too, huh? All right. Get on, sweetheart. - Feet on the floor, please. - They are! - Me too. - King Saul's Charter Service. - [Arguing] - We make jail calls. I appreciate it, Saul. We all do. You're a minister, you know. You're not a social worker. I'll file a complaint. See you. All right, y'all. Everybody sit down, now. Sit down, put your seat belts on. Nobody gets carsick, do they? - I do! - Just stick your head out that window! - Go on. It's not that cold out! - Saul! What did they give you? They give you eggs? Oh, no! [Engine Cranking] [Sighing] Okay. [Engine Continues Cranking] Come on. Great. Lord, if You are really up there... I need some help. - Henry? - You again. - Yep. - What do you want from me now? Uh, wait. I'm supposed to ask you that question. Right now, all I want is to put my key in the ignition... turn it and have it... [Engine Starts] - [Laughing] - What else? Oh, I suppose you think that you... Who are you? Really? All right, but it might be best if you don't tell anybody else. No. No. My name's Dudley, as you remember... when I saw you at the Youth Center, and... I'm an angel. I beg your pardon? An angel. You know, like in the Bible? Of course you are! The angel Dudley? - % Ding% - That must have been that part of the Bible that got lost. I knew you wouldn't understand. I know you don't believe me. It's hard, even for you. But angels cannot lie, Henry. We're not allowed to. It's in the angel handbook. - Of course it is. No, that's okay. - I'll show it to you. - No, I'm gonna show you. I'm gonna show you. - That's okay. Okay, fine. Thanks for everything. Say hello to the Big Guy and the Easter Bunny too. - Wait, wait, wait. Can I exp... - [Woman] It's freezing. - Let's get a cab. - Can't afford one. Can I get in? Yes, it's cold out and... Get in. - You've got a good heart, Henry. - Come on. - You've got a good heart. - Yeah, a good heart. - Are you ready? - Yes. Don't draw on the window. [Sighing] Oh, God. I miss this place, Henry. I had some wonderful times down here, I tell you. Oh, I'm not supposed to go into how l... Ohh. The seat belt, please. But, as you can see, I was cut down in my prime. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Ever since then, Henry, I've been up there... waitin' in line for a chance to get sent back down here. - It's a long line, too, let me tell you. - You don't say. Oh, I do say. You've got no idea what the competition is like just to get sent down here. Everybody wants this job. I don't know why He sent me, Henry, but I'm glad He did. - Yeah. - And I'm going to do everything I can to help you. - Thank you very much. - Oh, I need to go over the rules, if that's okay with you? - Oh, no, no, no. That's not necessary. - It'll only take a second, Henry. - Oh, all right. - "Rule Number One: We can't do anything you should be doing." That makes sense. If I'm doing it, that'd be two of us, wouldn't it? Exactly. "Number Two: Everything you do must be done of your own free will." - Now, that's a biggie. - Tough, but fair. Are there many more? Finally, when I leave, when the mission is accomplished, you won't have any memory of me. That's my favorite. Okay, so I got my rules. Where can I drop you? - Uh, how about right here? - Good. - See you later, Henry. - Um... Uh, ooh, ooh... Hold... Wait a minute. Look. If you... If you really want to talk to me, my office is always open. - Just make an appointment. - Thank you. Okay. Feel it? Kinda like springtime and Mom's home cooking all rolled into one? I don't feel a thing. You will. Have faith. Good night, Henry.

Look, I know things have been tough around here lately, and that's my fault. But everything is gonna be all right. - [Phone Ringing] - I'm comin'! Ooh! I got it! Hello? Who? - Mm-hmm. - If only saying it made it all right. - Yeah. - You see? If you'd listened, you'd have heard an apology. Not a big one, but a start. - Uh-huh. - No, what I heard is a man saying... "How can I deal with this fast enough, then get on with the rest of my day?" - You see, that's not fair. - Oh, it's not fair? Girl, I'm trying to listen! [Laughs] Yeah, I'll give him the message.

I wanted to. - [Gasps] - You smell wonderful. What do you call that? Soap. I haven't smelled a woman in such a long time. I'll get you a bar for Christmas. Do you have an appointment? Uh, no, not exactly. I was... sent to help the reverend, like an assistant. Assistant? I haven't heard anything about no... Oh, my Lord! Am I gettin' fired? No, no, no. It's just temporary. Temporary! I ain't heard nothing about no temporary! - Well, there's nothing... Uh, look. - Oh, God. - Let me get you some coffee. - Coffee! You made coffee on that machine?

We're running a little late. Okay. Take care of yourself, okay? See you soon. Say good-bye, Jer. Bye. Take care. Bye, Hakim. We'll miss you. Hold on, baby. It's cold out here. Who will I tell my secrets to? Well, you can phone Hakim sometimes, okay? And Mommy'll teach you how to write, so you can send him letters. Bye. I know You have a master plan, but... sometimes You're just a little tough to figure. Jeremiah. - Jeremiah. - It's not fair! Hakim left. [Crying] [Beverly] Julia. This is Dudley, the reverend's new assistant. Assistant? He wrote to the church council months ago for extra help. Well, the extra help is here. Oooooh. But he didn't say anything about getting a response. Who sent you, exactly? Uh, the, uh... [Clears Throat] The Top Man himself, Mrs. Biggs. - Julia. - Julia. [Clears Throat] And this is Julia's mother, Mrs. Coleman. [Dudley] Of course it is. Well, it's obvious where Julia's beauty comes from. Oh. And me with my hair lookin' like this. - Oh, no. It looks magnificent. - Why, thank you. - Well, Mr., um... - You can call me Dudley. - Dudley. You're very welcome here. - Thank you. Excuse us. What are you doing? Now, that's what I call good-lookin'! [Laughing] Your daddy used to look like that back in 19... Ma, ma, ma. I've heard it 100 times. Yeah, well, maybe now, with him around, you'll have time to deal with some of your own problems. [Julia] The Good Lord's the only one who can do that. - Honey, you don't mean that. - Yeah, I do. Ma! I was gonna go over by the window, Julia. There's too many rules in this house. [Gasping] You're the man in the street... and in the snow and... My name's Dudley. I'm here to help your father. - I'm Jeremiah. - It's nice to meet you, Jeremiah. You've got a real nice room here. Thank you. Wow, you've got a lot of neat stuff in here. And what is this? My toy ambulance is broken. The battery got stole, and the lights don't work anymore. Is that right? I'll see what I can do here. [Siren Wailing] It never had a siren! Never had a siren? No. You look sad there, Jeremiah. Have you been crying? Yes. I'm sorry about your friend, Hakim. What if I told you... that he's not really gone? Hakim? Did he run away and come back? - No, he never left. - Yes, he did. I saw him go. Well, you know, my mother... once lost someone who was very dear to her. He wasn't as young as Hakim, but he was... too young, just the same. And she would always do something that seemed to make her feel better. - You want to try it? - Yeah. All right, close your eyes. Do you remember playing in the snow with Hakim? Do you remember what his laugh sounded like? Yes. Do you remember what he looked like catching a ball? He never caught the ball in his life. But I remember. That's because when God takes someone away from us... He leaves what's most important about that person with us. Right here in our hearts. Yeah, but I still miss him. Well, she still misses him too. Are you all right? Maybe you should close your eyes. Mommy says I can write to him. - Do you know how to spell his name? - No. - You want to learn? All right. - Yeah! - Hakim starts with an "H." - And ends with "akim." - There you go. Perfect. - [Laughing] Wow! Fishies in a TV. [Computerized Fanfare] Windows. Henry? I know I said make an appointment... but I didn't say anything about filling out any form. [Sighing] Beverly! Beverly, I need you. I gave her the day off to do some Christmas shopping, Henry. You gave my secretary the day... Yes, she needed some time off to be with her children... and I needed time to do my job with you. - What job? What are you doing here? - Henry, Henry, Henry! How many times I got to tell you? I'm here in answer to your request for help. And Julia's. You can forget about the boiler. You got more important problem... Ah, here she is now. - [Julia] Henry? - Wha... [Marguerite] Whoo! Lord have mercy! Honey, remind me the next time I pay a visit, I wanna get paid! Okay? - [Laughing] - Hi, Dudley. - Julia. - Dudley. D-U-D-L-E-Y. - Perfect. - [Julia] Very good. - Poi-fect. Poi-fect. - What happened with Billy Eldridge? Uh, uh, the judge set the bail at $25,000. - Henry, that child's still in jail? - Julia, I did what I could! [Clearing Throat] Come on, sweetie. We have a nativity play to rehearse. You can't rehearse. It's freezing in there. Henry, I'll be chasing 15 kids all day. I don't think I'll get cold. And after we're through, you're taking your son shopping, remember? - Henry. - Huh? Your wife's talking to you. Oh, yes, uh, uh... Hanley's, 1:00. 1:00? Spell Hakim for me, baby. M-l-K-A-H. Dudley's teaching me to spell backwards. [Julia] Maybe he can teach Daddy how to be on time. These are perfect. Beverly never typed a perfect letter in her life. Yes, I did those myself, once I figured out that fish typewriter. Let's get this straight, Dud. I do not appreciate some stranger coming into my office... Angels are hardly strangers, Henry. And don't call me "Dud." [Marguerite] Julia, hold on! Wait for me! Excuse me, Mother, not now. I'm having a little meeting. You understand. - Bye, Marguerite! - Bye, Dudley! - [Julia] Mama, come on! - Start that rehearsal! You are not going around telling my family this ridiculous story... No, of course not. They think the church council sent me. The church council! Why don't we continue this on our way to the meeting with Joe Hamilton? [Gasps] The meeting. - [Dudley] So, which floor is he on? - [Henry] I'm not telling. - Henry, what's the floor? - Go away. - You asked for help. - Not from you. I don't need you in here, out there or anywhere. You didn't have to let the doors close on me downstairs, Henry. That was cold. Well, I figured you'd just fly up. You know, if you're really a you-know-what, where are your wings? You're caught up in stereotypes, Henry. That's your problem. Hello, Reverend. That's a beautiful dress you have on. Just magnificent. Why, thank you. - You're very welcome. - [Laughing] Is Mr. Hamilton inside? Oh, he's taping another TV commercial, but you can wait in his office. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. [Phone Ringing] Hamilton Realty. Hi, Amy. You know that old dress from Mom's closet? It's back in style. "That's a lovely dress!" It was a lovely dress. I mean, you gotta admit, it was a lovely dress. What kind of angel talks like that? The kind of angel that has good taste. Well, you're still not going in here. Henry, I'm like this with the creator of the entire universe. - Now, you don't think a little door's gonna stop me, do you? - Yes. How? How? Rule Number Two. All right, fine, Henry. Can't make you do anything you don't wanna do. That's right! That's right! I always liked that rule! Did you like that smile? I tilted my head to the side. I loved it. - Henry Biggs. - Joe Hamilton. - How are you doing? Julia's good? - She's very good. - [Clears Throat] - Uh, Henry, this is Debbie Page. - Hi. - She's the station manager over at WRKO. They're televising your Christmas sermon this year. We need to get your text for the TelePrompTer, Reverend. - I'm working on it. - Later, Debbie. Come on. Let's see the guys. - Wait 'til you see where you're gonna move to, Henry. - What? A planned community. Your son could ride his bike to school. [Men Chattering] - Mary? - Henry! Osbert? What are you doing here? Well, I, we, um... We came to check out, the same as you, Henry! Saul. Uh, listen to the man, Henry. We think it makes sense. Well, of course it makes sense. That's what it's gonna look like when it's finished. - What do you think, Henry? - Isn't that nice? It's a new city landmark. It's a whole new neighborhood. A different clientele, so to speak. I'm hoping, with everyone here, we can once and for all... persuade you to move into the new world, Henry. Well, all we need is a boiler that works... and we'll be fine in the world that we're in. [Laughter] New boiler. Henry, look at this. Day care facilities. [Mary] We need that. [Osbert] We could sure use that. Senior citizens' club. - That's much better than ours. - Mm-hmm. - What I'm offering you here, Henry... - Well, it is. TV cameras and lighting built right in. - [Saul] Look at that! - It's a pulpit to preach to the world! [Mary] It's beautiful! All you have to say is, "I'll do it." [Whispering] Say yeah. Say yeah. All right. Look, say yes, and I'll throw in that new boiler. I'll stop St. Matt's from freezing over Christmas... if that's the price I have to pay to get you. And if I accept, what price am I paying? Henry, what you see there is the answer to all your problems. [Osbert] Amen. Isn't it? - % % [Children Singing] - I need my Magi. The Magi's entrance. - What does the sheep say in this play? - Baaaa! Ah. Mmm. Does everybody know their parts? You know your parts? - What's my part? - What's your part? You're a camel. - I need my shepherds. - I'm a shepherd. - Come here. You two, over here. - I'm the angel. - In there. Come on. - [Children Chattering] [Julia] Kick it, Mrs. Havergal. Let's do this.

You take this one solo, okay? - Okay? - Comet's swingin'! - Ooh, look at that. - Beautiful, isn't it? Uh-huh. Sure is. Go in and try it on. We're supposed to be shopping for Henry, remember? You with that nightgown on is all the gift Henry would want. - Trust me. - A gift from Jeremiah. - Oh. Ho, ho. - Mmm. So how long do you think he's gonna be with that snake? He'll be along soon. How'd you two meet, anyway? Hmm. We were in adjoining strollers, and, uh... and one day I took his pacifier, and he made a really big noise about it. Who wouldn't? You know, when he was about ten, he started wearing suits to school. - What? - Trying to impress me. [Laughing] Obviously, it worked. He'd walk me home... and I always thought he was cuter without his glasses, so... one day he took them off for me. [Laughing] And he slipped on the ice, and fell right on his fanny. Sounds like love to me. Daddy said we were born friends. He did a lot for Henry, your father. He was the best. Mommy. Enough! % % ["Deck The Halls"] - Is it good, Dudley? - Mm-hmm. Great. How is your food, Jeremiah? Mmmmm. - Julia. - Henry. Ah, Jeremiah. Dudley! - Henry. - Okay, Jer. Let's go shopping. - Wait, honey. What happened? - I'll tell you later. - Come on. Come on. - Henry, it is later. It's about an hour later than when you were supposed to be here. - Now, what happened? - It's a long story. You know, you and Julia need to talk. I can take Jeremiah shopping. I'm an excellent gift consultant. Yes, Dudley. I want Dudley. Wait a minute. I wanted to take him shopping. You two have more important things to talk about. - Dud-ley! Dud-ley! Dud-ley! - Jeremiah. We'll be right across the street at the toy store. Okay? - Julia! Julia! - Dud-ley! - Jere-miah! Put your hat on. - Dud-ley! Dud-ley! - So, who are we shopping for? - Grandma. - Any idea what she wants? - A new ashtray. - Mom took all her old ones. - Let's get something for Hakim. So, what happened? Julia. L... I've decided to accept Joe Hamilton's offer. Julia, did you hear me? - I heard you. I just can't believe what I've heard. - Then let me explain. Excuse me. Can I get you anything? Oh, no, no, no. No, thank you. Okay. Listen, Saul was there, Mary Halford, Andy and Osbert. But what were they doing there? Every one of them was begging me, arguing with me, blackmailing me. - Blackmail! - They're gonna put in a new boiler tomorrow. - Henry, he bought you for a boiler? - Shh. Julia. [Diners Murmuring] Sorry. Sorry. Excuse us. Of course not! - Oooooh... - Julia, let me show you something. Julia, Julia... he is building the most beautiful church you've ever seen. Look at that. Day care center, youth center. Henry, he is building a shrine to himself! Eight years, Julia. And what do I have to show for it? So you give up our lives without even talking to me, Henry? This solves all of our problems, Julia. Why can't you see that? My father trusted you with St. Matt's. How dare you walk out on it like this! All right, all right. Your father was a saint, and I'm not! But I'm here, Julia, and he isn't. I'm sorry, Julia. Give me the car keys, Henry! Julia! - Julia, please sit down. - Give me the keys, Henry. Would you kindly give her the keys? I have customers sitting here. Sorry. Sorry. Julia, please listen to me. Henry, I can't. I don't even know who you are anymore. Julia. Come on, Jeremiah. We're leaving. I got Daddy's present. And I bought a fire engine for Hakim. It was on sale. Yes, that's wonderful, honey. That's wonderful. [Car Doors Closing] All right. You're going to have to support him now, Julia. You hear me? Now is when he needs you most. Mama, I can't support what's wrong. Preachin' God's word is never wrong, no matter where you do it from. He didn't even discuss it with me. Daddy would have never made a decision like that without discussing it with you. Sure he would. Your Daddy kept things from me all the time. Especially church business. Well, it was different in those days. Those days! Child, men ain't changed since Adam! And he gave up one of his own ribs, just so he could have somebody to keep things from! You know, gettin'angry at a dead tree is not gonna help. Yeah, but it wouldn't look good to punch out a pastor, either. No, you don't... you don't... you don't mean that... 'Cause you know you love him. Yeah, he knows it, too. That's the problem. He knows I'll always be there, just like a pet. - Ouch! - See? God doesn't like ugly. - Let me see. - [Whimpering] You ever had your palm read? [Chuckles] Okay. I see a beautiful woman with a good heart. Only has to open her eyes to realize that everything she ever wanted... she already has. You didn't even look at my hand. But I held it. Do you see Henry and me? Hmmm... let's see. - Ow! Ow! Ow! - Ohhh. Oh, it's so hot, I had to let it go. You must be talking about my past. - Mrs. Biggs, you forgot this. - Thanks. Every fire dies sometime, Dudley. What do you do when you have to decide if the memory of it is enough? - What do you do? - Yeah. What you do is you... you go dancing, that's what you do. You go out. - Dancing? - Yes. You're gonna go dancing, put on a beautiful dress, make your husband break out the cologne. - Have you met my husband? - That's right, I met him. - He hasn't taken me out in... - Far too long. That's my point. But tonight's gonna be different. Tonight you're gonna strike a match. No, not a match, a, a firecracker! You'll see. [Chuckles] You take your coat off, you go upstairs and you take your wife out dancing. Can't do it. Not tonight. Henry, you and Julia need this. Mr. Kingman needs his minister with him at the hospital, and the seniors need blankets. You're only one man, Henry. Things don't get fixed waiting for the next guy to do it. - Including marriages. - Dudley! Henry! You already told her, didn't you? She's upstairs dressing right now... - and once again I'm gonna look like the bad guy. - Not if you go. - Dudley! - What? I'm just trying to help you. You're just trying to help. All right, you can help... by taking her. - Me? - Yes, you. - You're missing the point, Henry. - No, no. The point is... Mr. Kingman won't wait. Now, you go, tell me all about it later. - [Sighs] - And you make sure you tell her I'm sorry. - [Dudley] Ohh, Henry. - Good night. - Henry. - Not too late. - Henry. - And no drinking. It was not supposed to go like this. [Jeremiah] Good night, Mommy. [Julia] Okay, good night. [Marguerite] Don't worry about us. I'm gonna give 'em a hot bath... and then we're gonna play Monopoly... for real money! [Jeremiah] Yea! [Whispering] How do I look? Oh! Oh, my! Henry? Henry? Henry? - Where's Henry? - He said... He said he's sorry. - He's sorry? - Yeah, he had to go. One of the congregation is in the hospital. Mr. Kingman. Oh, yeah. He's been sick a long time. I'll call his wife tomorrow. Look, Julia, he suggested that I, uh... pinch-hit for him, if that's okay with you. Hmm? [Doorman] Welcome to Jazzie's, folks. Come on in. - Thanks. - Thank you. - [People Clapping] - My brother. [Chattering, Laughter] Ahhh! Nice, huh? Dancing. Do you dance? I bet you're a good dancer. It's been a long time. You want to dance? Why not? [Laughs] - All right. - Give it a shot. - Bust a move. Right. - Bust a move. [Laughs] It doesn't seem like we're dancing right for this music, huh? [Man Laughing] Get down. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see what you mean. - [Snapping Fingers] Yeah. [Laughs] [Grunting] Oh, my. [Man] Go, brother! Ooh, hit it! - [Laughter, Chattering] - What's he doing? Mmm! Ooh. - What's that one? - The Popeye. - The Popeye. Okay. - [Laughing] - It's comin' back now. - I guess. [Screams] Whoo! You get out about as much as I do. Less! Even less! [Laughing] [Dudley] Oh, there we go! - [Julia] Oh, you're swimming. - Yeah, backstroking. [Laughter Continues] - Jules! - Bristloe! - How you doin', sweet thing? - Oh, my Lord! - I thought you were in Paris. - I was, but I've been back a while. You and Henry don't come by here much anymore. Henry's been real busy. But it's great to see you! - You too! How you doin', sweet thing? - Oh, I'm okay. Dudley, Bristloe. Bristloe, Dudley. - Oh, hey. How ya doin'? - A pleasure, a pleasure. If Henry hadn't helped me with that plane ticket, I never would've gotten to Paris. I tell you, I owe that man everything. - You should call him and tell him. - I will. Do that. He'd love to hear from you. Why don't we all just sit down and visit? Yeah. - Okay. - [Bandleader] Thank you. Thank you. So, Bristloe, are you and Maxine still together? - Oh, you better believe it. - Oh, good. She still calls six times a day to make sure I'm being a good boy. Fine woman, that Maxine. You married, Dudley? No, no. No, I've never been lucky enough to meet someone like Maxine... or Julia. Ain't that the truth? Used to be a time this little girl could come by here every night. - Yeah? You used to come in here? - Sure. Henry proposed to me right over there, in that booth. - Get outta here! Right over there? - That's right. - Those were the good old days, huh? - Sure were. - Couldn't squeeze a dime between 'em. - Whew. She used to go on stage and torch the place down. Get outta here. Now she just sings for the Lord. Not that that's bad. [Laughs] No, no, no. That's good. Let me tell you somethin'. Ever want to know what lovin' really sounds like... - she's got that secret in her voice. - Oh, Bristloe, please. Why don't you share that secret with us, Julia? - Come on, remind us. - No. It's been years, a long time. - You still do it in B? - No, no, Bristloe. I don't do it at all. Well, I'd like to know what love really sounds like. - Well, that solves that problem. - Bristloe. - I don't know the song. - Don't want to hear another word. - I don't... - We want to hear you sing. You sang it for Henry. [Julia] I should be going home. - We're going to play this in B. Just follow me, okay? - Okay. - Follow him, guys. - You go out there. Go on.

It's a secret. What are you getting Mom for Christmas? I don't know. What do you think I should get her? I think she'd like to go to bed. Excuse me, young man? She was looking at a nightie in the store window with Dudley. Was she now? All right, come on, young man. Sleep time. Wait for your mama to get home, you'll be too big for the bed. Go get some more Vicks on your chest. See if we can rid of that stuffy nose. I think you were born with a stuffy nose. Come on, here. - [Jeremiah] Good night, Daddy. - Good night, son. [Laughing] Oh, thank you. - [Driver] Have a good evening. - Thank you. - Did you have a good time? - Are you kidding? I had a great time. You? I had a ball. You're not such a bad dancer. - I haven't had so much fun in a long time. - I did too. - I heard you singing. - Yeah, I was about to get up there with you. - I'm so glad you didn't. - % I believe in miracles% - Shh! They're probably all asleep. - Not all of us. - Henry. - Dudley. I guess I don't have to ask if you had a... good time. We did. We went to Jazzies. Some of the old band was there, and... You've been at Jazzie's? Yeah. Yeah. Bristloe was there too. - Henry, your wife got on stage. - Oh, wait, wait. You went singing at Jazzie's all night? - You told me to take her out. - Not to the place where I proposed! Henry, we had fun. Remember what that used to be? But honey. Jazzie's? Well, maybe I sang at Jazzies because I won't be singing in any Joe Hamilton church, wherever that may be. - Thanks, Dudley. - Good night, Julia. - She had a good time, Henry. - Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. She told me about how you proposed. - She showed me the booth. - The booth? I don't believe this entire situation! No, you don't. That's your trouble right there. You don't believe in much of anything anymore, do you, Henry? You don't believe in me. You don't believe in yourself. You don't believe you can make a difference anymore. You don't even believe that Billy Eldridge is innocent. Billy... Of course I do. You don't sound very convincing, Henry. I tried to help him before. - Did you? - Yes. And besides, he doesn't even go to church. Have you tried looking him in the eye and asking him to tell the truth? No. You know why? I guess I was just too busy having fun. I guess that's your problem, Henry. You're just too busy. Your wife feels like she's in a marriage by herself. Your son lost his best friend. What are you doing about that, Henry? You don't have to listen to me. You're right. But you ought to listen to them. [Grandmother] Come on, everybody. Time to make the Christmas baskets. Aren't you gonna help? I miss Hakim. I know. But a lot of people are depending on us for those baskets. - What do you think? - Okay, then. All right? Gym socks. Now, nothing says "Merry Christmas" like gym socks. [Chattering] Ahh. Uh, Billy. Uh... here. Thank you. [Sighs] Billy, I need to talk to you. You're wasting your time, you know that? The grand jury's about to indict me in there. You ever pray, son? Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. You're too hip for that. All right. Okay. - You play ball? - Yeah. When you play basketball, don't you hope that when you shoot the ball... that the ball goes into the net? Yeah. Well, that's all prayer is: Hope. And helping to give people hope is what I do. What's the point? No one believes me anyway. Billy... Look at me, son. Were you a part of this or not? I swear, Rev, it happened just like I said. I've messed up before, but I'm telling you the truth. When was the last time you said a prayer, Billy? I don't know. Well, I think it's about time you gave it a try. - What's the status of this case? - Good morning, Judge! Beautiful day, isn't it? Reverend Biggs, this is not a playground! It's a court of law! I don't have time... I work for an even higher court, Your Honor, and I'm finding the time. - I came to tell you Billy Eldridge is innocent. - I have your word on that? - What does it take for me to show you? - Let him in. On his way to return a video, he got $20 from an auto-teller. There's a time on the receipt. - [Gasps] - The victim identified him, Reverend. The victim... Saw him standing there, Your Honor, and that's all Billy was doing. There's a grand jury hearing going on right down the hall... but the D.A. Won't even present it if you don't buy the evidence. - And you know there isn't any. - Reverend, come here. Come here. I appreciate you wanting to help the boy. The young man, Your Honor, helped himself. He shows up every day to his $4.25 an hour job at Sampson's Stationery... a job he's held steady for two years... and he goes to school at night. He came to a crossroads a long time ago, Your Honor. And he chose the right path. Now it's up to you... to judge not his past, but his future; not his failures, but his dreams; not his imperfections, but his possibilities. Hallelujah! % Hallelujah, hallelujah% % Hallelujah% - Is that Billy? - % Hallelujah, hallelujah% - It is! - % Hallelujah% % Mama, Mama, Billy's home! - They're all waiting for you. - Thanks a lot, Rev. - You're welcome, son. - [Girl] I prayed for you, Billy.

I had a good... - It was a nice time. - It was great. It was nice, skating. - Grandma. Yeah, we had a good time. - Yeah. - Yeah, it was great. - I laughed a lot. - Oh, my Lord! % Jingle bells Jingle bells% Not now, honey.

Julia, Henry can't be ten places at once. And don't tell me that your daddy could. Now pull yourself together, young lady. You're a married woman. Oh, Ma, I can look in the window. Even if I don't buy. Well, you just better not go window shopping with money in your pocket. And you better not be puttin' anything in the layaway plan, either. - You hear me? - Oh, Ma. % Two turtledoves% - % And a partridge in a pear tree% % - [Imitates Trumpet Sound] - Let's do it again. - Oh, no more, Jer, please. - Oooh! - Your dad's home. Daddy, where were you? I'm sorry, Jer. I really am. I just can't understand why the traffic was so bad. We'll go tomorrow, okay? Okay. I did skating, Dad. You did? Good for you. And I got Billy Eldridge home for Christmas. They dropped the charges, Henry. How'd you do it? I just remembered you gotta look someone in the eye to see if they're innocent. So it wasn't that hard. [Laughing] - Daddy? - Yes, son? - Skating isn't hard, neither. - It isn't? Your mom taught you, huh? Dudley and Mom. It was fun! Dudley went skating with you? We waited for you, Henry. You didn't miss much at all. [Dog Barking] Ah, Henry! Just the man I wanted to see. I've been working on this... Keep away from my wife. What'd I do now? - You take her to lunch. - Well, you were late, Henry. - You take her to Jazzies. - You asked me to. You take her skating. What kind of man do you think I am? Keep the hell away from her. Henry, you're a man of God. That doesn't mean I'm blind. Now, I've seen the way she looks at you. Really? I mean, really. All right, fine. I want you to leave now. - Now? - Yes, now. [Opens Door] I don't think I can do that. Check the angel handbook. It says I can't leave until I'm through, I think. [Muttering] You see, it says right here... Wait a minute. Hey! Henry! What was that? - Oooh! - My goodness! - What? - You're in trouble. What was that? What is that? It wasn't a sign that there's a new pope. - What do you mean? - You're in trouble. You want me out of the house. - Yes, I want you out. - I'm not the problem. It wasn't me. - It wasn't me! - Who are you talking to? Get out of my house! What is going on in here? - I am terminating Dudley's services. - Is that what you want, Julia? It isn't a question of what she wants. All right, Julia, you're a part of this. You say. You two stop this right now. Just stop it! You hear me? [Slams Door] - [Henry] You see what you did? - It's not about me. You and Julia would have these problems even if I never showed up. You've forgotten what's important, for you and for her. And you're going to remind me, I'm sure. St. Matt's is more than just a church, Henry. It's the glue that holds everything together in this neighborhood. And you mark my word, without it, this neighborhood will fall, I guarantee it. And Julia will never look at you the same. [Door Opens] Hey, handsome. Come and walk me across the street. I gotta take this plate over to Bessie Adams. - Well, actually, I was... - Walk me! Delighted. - I heard what you two were talking about. - Really? Now, you know I don't usually pry into other folks' business. - Uh-huh. - Hold on a second. Mmm-mm! Now, what are you doing to my daughter? Mrs. Coleman, it's all right, I promise you. Nothin' is all right, Dudley, when I see a married woman look at a man that way. I'm just tryin' to help them, that's all. [Laughs, Coughing] You really shouldn't smoke. Our time here on Earth is precious. That's right. And you know the most precious time of all is time spent with your family. Now, you know I'm supposed to only be here through Christmas. But I will conveniently have a hip injury... and stay to the year 2000 if I have to. Do you understand what I'm sayin' to you? - I do now. - Mm-hmm. Look, I'm havin' a little trouble tryin' to get through to Henry. Now, Julia, on the other hand, she's wonderful. She deserves... What are you talkin' about what Julia deserves and what she don't? She's Henry's wife. Don't worry. L... I'm sure she'll forget me as soon as I leave. She'll forget herself if you go on like this. [Bessie] Marguerite, is that you? I'm comin', Bessie! Now, Dudley, you are a charming person. You go charm somebody else. Okay? Bessie, I'm comin' in. Did I tell you I quit smokin'? [Bessie] I'm so proud of you, sugar. [Chattering Continues] [Saul] Watch it. Don't slip now. Come on, babies, let's go. Thank you so much. Now you have a lot more room. - Bye. - Hi, Dudley! - I'm just baby-sitting Jeremiah. - [Chuckles] - Mommy, Mommy! Here, puppy. - Get away from that dog! - Go ahead! - Jeremiah! Jeremiah! [Beverly] Saul! [Man On Bus] Where's he goin'now? Thank you so much for the ride. I know you had to go out of your way. The first five minutes of The Nutcracker hasn't changed any since last year. - I'll make 'em leave before the bows so we can come and get you. - Oh, thank you. - [Laughs] Um... - Um... - [Laughing] Thanks. - [Laughing] Okay. [Laughing Continues] - Bye-bye. - Bye! [Man On Bus] No time for that, Saul. Come on, we're gonna be late.

You're so jealous, you can't even think straight. I am thinking just fine, thank you. - You can't even remember where the Keeleys live. - The Keeleys' house is on Sixth. - Then what's it doing over there? - What? Hmm. [Opens Door] [Muttering] Keeleys moved. Woodlawn. Sixth. - Is this it? - Mm-hmm. There's the house. - Be careful, Henry. - I will be. Drive all this way, they're probably not even home. At least they could shovel their walkway. - Whoooaaah! - [Gasps] [Groaning] Henry! [Laughing] What are you laughin' at? [Laughing] You look like a kid. Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Let me help you up. Thanks, babe. - [Gasps] - Oh, baby. What are you doing? - I thought you was helpin'me up. - You did this on purpose. [Laughing Continues] Eddie, come here quick. It's the preacher. - What's goin' on? - I hope you didn't hurt yourself. - You all right? - We're fine. I told these kids to shovel that walk. They ain't got nothin' on their mind but Santa Claus. Sorry. - This is yours. Merry Christmas. - Us? - Merry Christmas. - God bless you. - You'll catch cold. Be careful. - We will. [Henry] I'll see you on Sunday. [Mr. Keeley] We'll be there. All of us. [Henry Sighs] Seems like we've been doin' this forever. Forever is right. Do you remember the first time? - My mother was visiting, yeah. - Yes. - You know, Henry, she never liked me. - No, no, that's not true. She used to say, "Girl, you better get some meat on them there bones." Well, she just wanted you to eat, that's all. - No, she wanted me to be as fat as her. - She wasn't that fat. Henry, a policeman walk down the street, see your mama and go, "Break it up!" - Stop! - [Laughing] Stop it! Rest her soul. [Laughs] It's good to see you laugh again. It's nice to have a reason to. You know, I miss this Henry. I wish he'd show up more often. There. We did it. I'm gonna go to the church for a minute. You go on inside.

Uh... Joe... I need to speak with you. [Laughs] Can we... Go ahead. I have no secrets from my own people here. In fact, sit down... I've reconsidered. I don't want the job. - Let's go, guys. - I can't leave my own people, Joe. And they can't afford to travel clear up here. - And as far as moving, Julia and l... - Henry, a deal is a deal. My decision is final. I'm sorry. You're sorry. Sorry is not good enough, Henry! You don't get it, Henry. I don't care about St. Matt's. St. Matt's is where we've been, not where we're going! Only if people like you abandon it, Joe. [Sighs] You know, it used to be you couldn't just pick up... and move away from your own people as soon as you made a couple of bucks. There was nowhere else for us to go. But at least our kids got to grow up with their heroes. Henry, I'm trying to be nice to you because you and I go back a ways... and the old reverend was always real good to me. But this is gonna happen whether you want it to or not. With all due respect, Joe, how do you think you can make me... Not you. The church. It's coming down. What's coming down? The church is... Henry, do you know why I am a trustee of a church I don't go to? Because your deacons all came begging to me, telling me how broke the church was. I bought the mortgage. That's right! I own it, and it's coming down. That land's worth a lot more to me with nothing on it. - You're gonna tear down my church? - That's right. - A-And build a mall and tennis courts. - Tennis courts? Henry, we're gonna turn that neighborhood around, attract some real money to that place. - Oh, I see. Yeah. - You see what I'm saying? You think without me there to lead them, the people will just cave in. - That's why you got me here! - No, Henry, I want you to lead them. - But into the future. - Whose future, Joe? They don't play much tennis. Joe, come back to the church. See exactly who you'll be hurting. See their faces, their families, their... their children, Joe. People are a lot tougher than you think, Henry. [Sighs] Henry, look. Come on, they'll survive. And you still think you care about the things we care about? "Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger." - That's what I say. - Only louder. [Louder] "Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger." Then Michael and Jessica come on... and sing a really slow song. It's not that slow, and it's very pretty. Meanin' to ask you, you two have a fight last night? No, Ma, we delivered Christmas baskets. - The gym socks were a big hit. - Huh! I knew they would be. - [Julia] That you were right about. - Hi there. - [Julia] Henry. - [Grandma] Hello. Dad, Jason got sick, and I'm gonna be a shepherd in the nativity play. - I won't have to say "baaa." - Ohh. - [Laughing] - That's great. 'Cause someone very special is gonna be in the audience listening to every word you say. Huh? - Your mother and I figured out what you'd like for Christmas. - Yeah. - [Jeremiah] Did you wrap it up? - Not quite. [Gasps] Hakim! I missed you. [Laughing] Ohhh. [Laughs] Is he going to stay forever and ever? Well, just 'til the new year. Then after that, we'll see. - [Both Cheering] - [Laughing] I have a secret to tell you. My ambulance has a siren now. [Hakim] Really? - [Jeremiah Praying] God bless Mommy and Daddy... - [Toy Siren Wailing] And Grandma... - [Hakim] And my grandma. - Amen. - Okay, guys, you ready? - We did our prayers. 'Cause we were already on our knees. Okay. It's time to get into bed now. Come on. Boing! All right. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. No talking late now. Close the door, please. Okay. - Wait 'til you meet Dudley. - Who's that? - The man in the gray coat. - Huh? - You remember. - Oh! Christmas is supposed to be... the most joyous day of the year. - Henry? - Hmm? - Would you like some hot chocolate? - No, thank you. I've got to check the fuse box. If we put any more lights on that tree, we're gonna blow up the house. [Door Closes] [Henry's Voice] Christmas is supposed to be the most joyous day of the year. But for St. Matt's, it's a day to surrender. Not because I'm going to preach at another church, as some may believe... but because the people who own the building are going to tear it down. - Now, it's no one's fault. There is no one to blame. - Henry. It just seems as though despite our best efforts, our dream... - my dream for St. Matthew's... will not come to pass. - Ohhh. But let's remember the good things we've shared over the years. The laughter, the exploding boiler... the sounds of voices raised to heaven. I'll miss it all. I thank you for your efforts. I thank you for your friendship. God bless you.

You can walk away from it, but it's still there. [Joe's Voice On Radio] What do you see when you look at a place like this? I'll tell you what I see. Sterling Acres. The latest development miracle from Hamilton Realty. I see 200 luxury apartments. Over here, a 24-hour health club right on the grounds. - State of the art designer interiors. - This thing is broken. - The kind of home that you deserve. - It's not even plugged in. - [Radio Continues] - That's very smooth, however you did all this. [Radio Stops] But you gotta do better than that. Yeah... you gotta do a lot better than that... to get to me. Have to do a whole lot better than that to get to me. Whoever you are. Don't worry about who I am, Joe. You won't even remember me tomorrow. But remember this: Look at the real price before you close the deal. - What's that supposed to mean? - You know what it means. Listen to your heart. Do what it tells you. You'll find your way. [Applause, Cheering] [Applause Continues] [Jeremiah] Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger. [Louder] Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger. [Laughter] [Yelling] Hark! I hear Joseph and Mary in the manger. - Where's Joseph and Mary? - [Laughter] Ohhh.

It's funny, you know, I spent the last 30 years... thinking I'd be happy if I could just get back to this place. Here? The council must send you to some dead neighborhoods. [Chuckles] Well, dead is relative. But now I know where I belong. Is this because of me? No. Mmm. Well, maybe just a little bit. You remember when you asked me what you do... when the flame between two people goes out? Yes. The answer is: You don't let it. Will we ever see you again? I don't know. Well, let's see.

Sometimes we... we take love for granted. - Am I right about it? - [Congregation Agreeing] Those who are nearest to us... dearest to us... those are the ones we forget to cherish. But the miracle is... when we love someone... we are really loving God. [Congregation Murmuring] Look in wonder at those you love... for they are the face of God. - Hallelujah. - Hallelujah. And when the path is dark... - Amen. - And the road bends... we will let the Lord show us the way. - He will give us heart and make us whole. - Amen!
