You know, I get this really stupid employee discount at that restaurant. If we walked over there, they'd pretty much give me an entre for free. But that's not really my style, you know? Or we could head back to my place. My shift doesn't start until a movie or something. Like I said, I get paid by the mile. [ Sighs ] Sounds like that's a pretty dangerous job. A lot more dangerous things if you made a list. You got a list? No. [ Laughs ] No, I don't have a list. You sure you're not hungry? Do you wanna watch TV? Got to make it to Reno in the morning. Oh, yeah. Of course. Hey, um, listen. I really appreciate the motel room. It's not really my style to let the female pay. And I-I don't want you to think that I just used you or-or anything. - I don't. - Oh, okay. That's good. Um, you want my e-mail? Take it easy. [ Engine Starts ] [ Engine Revving ] [ Beeping ] [ Boy Laughing ] [ Door Squeaking ] [ Keys Dropped On Counter ] [ Sighs ] [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Answering Machine Beeps ] Diane, it's Jenny Bell again-- Len's fiance.

Well, I guess you'll be getting some discounted drinks then. Just got paid. You're going with me. [ Grunts ] I can't, Runner. I just got back. You know it's a dream of every man in California... have an opportunity to get drunk with you. I'm not sure that's a compliment, Runner. Well, it ain't an insult. Come on. [ Sighs ] It's that country-western crap? Seventies night. Seventies night at the V.F.W.? [ Gasps ] Let me get my lipstick. [ Disco ] [ Man Laughing ] [ Glass Hits Table ] You just gonna sit there all night? You gonna let me sit here all night? [ Funky Soul ] [ Female Back-up Singers ] We found the spark  [ Female Singer ] Oh, baby, you're glowing  Started a fire  Oh, baby, you're burning  Looks like we made a soul connection  We found a soul connection  To find out  Find out  That what we have is real  Have is real  We had to find out  Find out  That what we have is real  To find out  Find out  That what we have is real  [ Ends ] This is fucking great. That's-That's a pretty drink. [ Laughs ] I'm going to the bathroom. [ Chuckles ] [ Country Western ] [ Door Opens ] Hey there. Hey there. Do-- [ Chuckles ] Do you know me? No, I don't you. Maybe I could though if I tried real hard. Yeah. Um-- [ Chuckles ] Well, I'm Rick. I'm Runner's brother-in-law. [ Mumbling ] Oh. Rick. Yeah, he's mentioned you. Oh, good. Hey. Excuse me. Hey. Excuse me. Yeah, he's married. Yeah, but we're not fucking each other. So excuse me. I'd like to avoid a bladder infection. Oh, well, did you ever hear of that term, "playing with fire"? Yeah. I think you're doing it right now. No. You are. No. You are. Move it, shithead. Don't be a home wrecker now. A good one. Hey, Rick, how's it going? Well, not as good as you. Go home, Rick. You're a lucky guy, Runner. You're a real fucking lucky guy. [ Radio: Christian Rock ] What the fuck do you have this thing set for? What? That's Christian rock. You caught me listening to Christian rock? Yeah. It's soft rock. Have you ever heard of F.M.? - There's a difference. - Oh, my God. What is this? This is reggae. - [ Reggae ] - Just don't go poking and banging at it like that. Basic radio, for Christ's sake. Don't punch it. [ Laughing ] Keep hitting the bottle. [ Chuckling ] [ Reggae Continues ] What? [ Tires Squeal ] Jesus! [ Groans ] [ Continues ] Okay. Oh, my wife's gonna kill me. She's gonna have to stand in line. Ow! Ow. Slide over. Ow. God. Where you going? I'm suffering here. Goddamn. You're really a bleeder. Kind of like what you're doing though. Shut up. [ Laughing ] Oh, wait, wait. Here. Here. Here. Here. [ Continues ] Hold it down.

Oh, I swear to God. [ Engine Starts ] [ Tires Squeal ] [ Brakes Squeak ] [ Engine Off ] [ Grunts ] Oh, Jesus Christ. - [ Door Closes ] - [ Groans ] Ooh, you really did it this time. [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] This is the last time we're going out. [ Groans ] Tonight was a wake-up call. You lead a lonely life. Ow! Shut up, Runner. You did that on purpose. Yeah, you think? Ow! [ Groans ] God, you're a heavy sack of shit. Why don't you settle down? Why don't you-- Why don't you find Jesus? What do you know about Jesus? [ Runner ] Nothing. Then why do you suggest that I find him? I don't know. I heard he makes people happy. - Shut up. - Oh! [ Laughs ] [ Laughing ] Oh, you are dead weight. Okay. [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles, Groans ] Shh. You're gonna get me in trouble. Shh. Shh. Shh. [ Exhales ] [ Both Laughing ] [ Panting ] - Diane? - Yeah. [ Panting Continues ] You're so pretty. Thank you, I think. Oh, idiot. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Nice, sis. I told you, Molly. Shut up, Rick. Hey. [ Engine Running ] [ Engine Stops ] [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Keys Jingling ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Diane! Hey! - [ Grunts ] What the hell are you doing? Who the hell are you? You know who I am. I'm Jenny Bell. I've been calling you and writing you. Well, Jenny Bell, I don't check my messages all that often. Diane, listen, Len's got an infection. All right? And he's in the hospital for a few days. And I have to leave tomorrow night to go to my mother's funeral. So you can see I have somewhat of a dilemma. Well, Len and I have an agreement. Yeah, well, it was Len's idea. Don't you have some neighbors or some friends or something? I guess not. All right, Diane, listen, you don't owe me anything, all right? But I can't work and take care of Len... and go to my dead mother's send-off and watch your fucking kid right now. Yeah, well, I'm on the road all the time. It's three weeks. Three weeks? Yeah. Peter, come on over here. No. Mm-mmm. Peter, come over here. No, Jenny. No. Peter, come on. Jenny. Fuck you. Peter, come on. Listen, we talked about this. Peter. Peter, listen to me. [ Grunts ] Listen to me, all right? It's just for a little while until your dad's feeling better. All right? Listen. He loves you, and he needs you to do this for him. Can you do this for him? All right? Say "okay." Come on. Thanks a lot, Diane. I'm gonna call you in a few days, all right? [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Engine Starts ] You're gonna stand there all night? Go on. So you can crash right there, all right? I'm gonna get this whole mix-up resolved tomorrow. All right? I'm gonna go see Leonard in L.A. Runner will watch you. He's my friend. He'll probably be pretty hungover though. Yeah. [ Foot Tapping ] So I just got the one-bedroom house. Just a one-bedroom. [ Exhales ] Don't like to talk, huh? I don't like to talk to bitches. Fair enough. Ooh. You ever had a breakfast burrito before? Not bad for a dollar, twenty-nine. Come here nearly every day before work. What do you do? You ever heard of a jack-of-all-trades? Well, that's me. Actually, I'm more of a-- more of a six of diamonds-of-all-trades. You see those guys right over there? I work with them sometimes. [ Speaking Spanish ] Aren't they illegal immigrants? Well, I guess it depends on who you ask. Yeah. Sure. It's good. Take a big bite. It's full of eggs. You're gonna like it. So your dad's got the big "C," huh? Sorry to hear about that. Yeah, well, it's just in his colon. No big deal. He'll get better. Yeah. Sure he will. You'll go back to your old school and your pals, and your mom can get back to her regular life. I hate my school, and I don't have any pals. You got to have a best friend. Me and my dad are best friends. Well, I guess you're the sort of guy... who's choosy about who he's buddies with. I can relate to that. I'm a bit of a-- a bit of a lone wolf myself. You're gonna use your hot sauce? [ Woman On P.A., Indistinct ] Excuse me. I'm looking for Leonard Bonner's room, please. It's Room 608, and it's right down the hall. Thanks. You got it? Got it. You got the I.V., sweetie? I got it, baby. [ Len Groaning ] Damn it. All right, we'll clean that up later. [ Sighs ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Jenny ] Does it hurt? No. I'm all right. Just a little sore. Okay. [ Monitor Beeping ] Hey, baby. Yeah? Can you get me some water? [ Door Opens ] Three weeks. Don't you have a home? Me or him? [ Fingers Snapping ] - Where you going? - Oklahoma City. Get up. You're going with me. Where's Oklahoma City? Take a guess. I'm not going. I can take care of myself. Dude, I'm trying to pay my bills here, all right? I don't have time to play nice right now. Well, then, why don't you ask me and not just tell me? All right, listen, do you wanna go? I don't know. Do you want me to go? Why don't you tell me if you wanna go? You tell me first. Why don't you tell me first? 'Cause I was the one who asked first. So? So that's how it works. Dude, man, I got to get on the road. This is too much for me. If you ask me and act like you want me to go, then I'll go. All right, man, do you wanna go? Do you wanna go with me? Do you wanna go to Oklahoma City with me? Please. I'll think about it. [ Exhales ] [ Country Western ] Everybody calls me the girl in the little pink Mack  The bumpers are chrome and so are the wheels and the stack  It's got polka dot curtains hanging in a sleeper of pink  Ha-ha, this Mack's a dandy  Some kind of truck they think  In my truck-drivin' boots I stand about 5 foot 3  But don't let the size fool you Man, I can take care of me  When you see a flash of pink go flyin' by  The next thing you know there's a taillight in your eye  Everybody wonders who'd drive such a rig like that  All the truckers would ask "Who's the gal in the little pink Mack"  - [ Radio Off ] - Big country, huh? Stay in the truck. What's up? Just about everything, darlin'. Hey, you see a little kid around? Hey, you see a little shit of an 11-year-old boy roaming around here? Hey! You seen an 11-year-old kid running around here? He might be over there. [ Panting ] Shit. Hey! Hey! Shit. Oh, shit. Goddamn it. You little goddamn shit. What the hell are you doing out here? I was just looking around. Do you understand what this fucking place is? It's people coming in and out of here from God knows where. They'd like nothing better than to get their grimy little hands on your pretty little face. You're crazy. Damn it. I told you to stay in that truck. Listen, I'm sorry I smacked you, all right? But I don't wanna be reading about you in the newspaper tomorrow morning. Okay? Let's go. I don't feel like it yet. Listen to me. I wanna make the New Mexico line by nightfall, all right? I want my on-time bonus. So? My ass hurts now, and I just feel like sitting. You got two minutes. You give Len this much trouble? I don't make trouble. People make trouble for me. [ Scoffs ] Ever get into fights? Kids picking on me, calling me names. I don't care. You ever win? Well, I just freeze up. Whatever. I'll go back there soon, and you won't have to worry about anything. I'm not worried about anything. It seems weird for a woman to be driving a truck. Yeah, well, what should I be doing? I don't know. Something else. Yeah, well, I like being my own boss. I own that truck. I paid it off this year. It's a hell of a lot better than being a nurse or a waitress or something. Wiping tables or wiping asses. Just seems pretty lonely and boring. Yeah. Not everyone's cut out like everyone else. Come on. New Mexico's calling. Wait up. Why are you walking so fast? [ Mocking ] "I wanna get my on-time bonus." Give it a rest, kid. [ Sets Brake ] Why are we stopping? Get some sleep. - Where? - Back there in the bunk. Where else? Okay, I am not sleeping back there. No way. I wanna stay at a hotel. Oh, damn it. There are only a couple of reasons to get a hotel room when you're out on the road, and this ain't one of 'em. Get your ass back there. [ Sighs ] [ Blows Lips ] [ Sighs ] Shouldn't you brush your teeth or something? I don't have a toothbrush. Yeah? Well, what have you been using then? - My finger. - Yeah? How's that? [ Scoffs ] That's disgusting. You're gonna catch something like that. Well, give me some money, and I'll go across the street. I saw a store. [ Bag Unzips ] [ Objects Hit Counter ] [ Sighs ] Hey! That's my shit. That's personal. Not anymore. Hey, dude! Dude! Listen to me. You can't go out there by yourself, dude. It's dark out there. [ Boy Speaking, Indistinct ] Hey, faggot. Go buy me something. [ Door Bell Rings ] Do you think he'll buy you something? Hey, homo, what did you get us? Nothing, dickhead. What'd you just say? [ Grunts ] Shit, man, what did you do that for? I wasn't-- I was trying-- Hey, come back here! Dude, I wasn't trying to do that. [ Grunts ] Hey! Hey! Who did that? Who? Some boys across the street. [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Horn Honking ] [ Speaking, Indistinct ] Hey! Wha-- You fucking better watch who you fuck with! All right? You got it! [ Door Bell Rings ] Fuck was that? Whoa. And a pack of generics. [ Panting ] [ Panting Continues ] I'll get dressed. Ow. [ Monitor Beeps ] Ow. [ Grunts ] I know it hurts, son. You could hold his hand. Sorry. Here you go. You drink coffee? Yeah. Why not? Thanks. I like a lot of cream. Can we stop and see some stuff along the way? We already lost half a day. Right. That's a good stick you got there. Thanks. Oh, no, you didn't. Get back here. Hey! Hey, Diane! [ Laughs ] Just hang tight, all right? Hey. Okay, we're all set, honey. Great. I just can't give you your on-time pay. Jonnie, I always deliver early. I know. My boss just won't let me-- Jon, that's a bunch of bullshit. Is that your kid, hon? Yeah, it's my kid. But I'm gonna be rid of him in less than a month. All right? He lives with his dad. Does he go to school? No, he don't go to school. Yeah, Di, but federal law and all. Jon, I need new tires. Look, it's been a little light here. I'll-I'll call you when we get something in. Right. All right, let's go. And I'll be rid of you in a month too. Bitch. I didn't mean that. [ Door Opens ] You didn't say one word since Texas. You think it's easy being stuck in a cab with an 11-year-old who doesn't say anything? Well, it ain't easy, all right? It'll drive a person crazy. Dude, and that's what you're doing right now, man. Living with you will drive me crazy. [ Objects Clattering ] Listen, you have no idea what my life was like before you got here. And you walked through this door and expect everybody to roll right over for you. Well, I didn't ask for your dad to get cancer, and I didn't ask for you to show up either. Well, then why did you have me then? - I didn't wanna have you, goddamn it. - [ Objects Hits Window ] [ Object Hits Counter ] I didn't mean that. I wanna see my dad, and I'm gonna tell him everything. Everything! Hey. Hey! Hey! I got a name, bitch! You stop calling me that. I am not a bitch. Look, I knew what you were-- just a lot lizard tramping around in dirty truck stops. That's not was I was, dude. You little shit. That's not what I was. Goddamn you. [ Quietly ] That's not what I was. [ Water Starts Running ] [ Water Stops ] Dad! [ Len ] Oh! [ Speaking, Indistinct ] I missed you. Wow. I missed you. How you been? All right? Dad, I'm gonna get some ice cream. Hey, get some whip cream on mine. Okay. I'll get some too. [ Sighs ] You know, after you took off, I-I planned on how it was gonna be when I saw you again. [ Laughs ] Well, 10 years later, this ain't it. You look fine. You dating anybody? Dating? Yeah? You ever think about marrying again? To who? Not me, I guess. I'm not very good future husband material these days. Yeah, well, you'll be making Jenny miserable soon enough. So did he turn out at all like you thought he would? He looks like you, doesn't he? He did when he came out, so I figured he'd stay that way. What the hell are you trying to pull, Leonard? Listen, Di, I-- [ Chuckles ] I had no choice. All right? I-- I couldn't find anybody to take him. Well, when is Jenny coming back? She's staying with her dad a little bit longer. I can't keep asking her to watch after him all the time anyway. I mean, she's got to work too. I need your help. I'm-- I'm talking about a month maybe. I'm on the road two weeks at a time, sometimes more, Len. [ Exhales ] I'll pay you. Fuck you. Goddamn it. You always knew just what to say to make me wanna break your neck. We made this arrangement Yeah, we did. Yeah, we did. I know. Ten years ago, and that's that. So shut the hell up, 'cause you're gonna be just fine. Oh, Jesus Christ. [ Sighs ] They're all white trash out here. Yeah, but they're California white trash, and they all got suntans. Listen, I got to make that run, but I won't be back too late. I'm trusting you now, right? [ Bell Ringing ] Runner will check in on you. I'll be fine. [ Exhales ] [ Engine Starts ] Hey. Oh, hey, Runner. What are you doing? I thought I'd finally build that gate for your mom... so she can lock up her stuff when she's doing long trips. Wanna help me? Oh, I'm not great at stuff like that. Ah, everybody's good at stuff like this. It's easy. And it makes you feel good even if you do it half assed. [ Sighs ] Here. Hang on to this. [ Groans ] I'm good. Trust me. You're gonna love this. It's lots of fun. I don't wanna mess it up. Here. Making mistakes is the only way you learn. And trust me. I learn like four or five things every day. All right. All right. Grab a bunch, slap it on the edge, just like you're putting icing on a cake. Your mom is gonna be real surprised when she gets back from Phoenix. She's been doing a lot of short hauls lately, hasn't she? I guess. Perfect. All right. Grab one of these. [ Grunts ] Try to set it down nice. A little more that way. Like that? Uh-- Good. You know... when I was a kid, my folks got divorced. I tell ya, the best day of my life was when my dad left. Now he had the meanest left hook. Never could see it coming. Think that's why I did so good in the army. Diane said you got shot. Yeah. And it hurt like a son of a bitch. Still does sometimes. So what are you, in grade six now? Yeah. You into that new school? Well, there's this kid I like. I might try out for baseball even though I suck. Yeah? Baseball's good, sure. Oh, yeah, your dad used to play, right? Yeah. Yeah, your mom told me. She used to go watch him. Your mom's pretty good with a glove. Should ask her. Probably give you a few pointers. Yeah, maybe. [ Diane's Voice ] All right, man, you just gotta lean into it, okay? Really, really lean into it. [ Peter ] All right. Whoa! What was that? Oh, my God. I thought it was gonna get me. You just gotta keep your eye on it. All right, I'll be easy on you this time. [ Sighs ] Whoa! Are you trying to kill me? I didn't say walk into it. Let's do it again. I'm afraid of you. What's there to be afraid of? Come on. Just don't get crazy with that thing. Ohh! Ohh! I didn't mean that. Goddamn it! Dude! Dude! Dude, that is not cool. I got to go. Yeah. But listen. You have to take a swing at that thing if you wanna get anywhere. I just wanna hit it. That's all I wanna do. You can hit a home run. No, I can't. I know what I can do and what I can't. Why, because somebody tells you so? No, because I know so. And you think you're so tough. Trying to tell everyone what to think. But you're the one who's always scared of stuff. You're the scaredest person I know. [ Horse Whinnies, Nickers ] [ Sighs ] Hey. [ Diane ] Nice gate you got going here. Well, it's a start. You know, I was thinking maybe you and me and Peter, we could all do something together, you know? Go dirt biking or something. I don't think that's such a good idea. Yeah. Pretty dangerous. Yeah. What's he doing right now? Watching TV. Seems to be taking to it out here a little bit. Yeah, well, he'll be back in L.A. soon enough. Yeah. You know, I lived in this house six years? Yep. - I'm gonna own it someday. - That's right. - You agree too much. - Am I agreeing? Mm-hmm. Well, sure, I'm agreeable. Stop looking at me, man. You want something from the store? Nah. I'll get on that gate. I'll finish it soon. [ Dog Barking In Distance ] [ TV Playing, Indistinct ] Come on. Get up now. Turn off the TV. Why? - [ TV Turned Off ] - Go brush your teeth. - What are you doing? - I'm trying to be nice here. [ Sighs ] Okay. [ Spits ] This is my blanket. Here. It's your dad's. It's pretty raggedy, but, uh, you can have it to sleep with. I don't sleep with stuffed animals. It's a clown actually. But I-- I gotcha. Okay. Good night, then. - Diane? - Yeah? Dad said that when he was on the road with his team... he stopped off in Needles, California, and saw you at a truck stop. Yeah, well, flat broke. [ Chuckles ] You know how that can be. He said you were the most beautiful girl he ever saw. He said that, huh? I was 18. All 18-year-olds are beautiful. He said you didn't leave because of me. But I know you did. It wasn't you particularly that made me leave. It's just that your dad's a man, and a man's man to a fault. And a man like that expects a woman to do a whole bunch of things I wasn't prepared to do. Like what? Like staying around the house... and being like a-- like a woman everybody's used to. What's wrong with staying around the house? Some people like staying around the house and some people don't. Doesn't make you a bad person, right? Does Jenny stay around the house? No. - See? - But she wants to. Me and your dad were staying in this bungalow we rented in Hollywood. It was a pretty nice place, you know? I'm getting kinda tired, kid. Okay. I don't know. You know, I've been thinking about it and... being in that house holding you or feeding you a bottle or something, and it was like I was half there. You know? It was like I had this body, but it wasn't mine, and I just moved it around or something. And then one day you were both asleep and I just... took the money I was saving and I just left. Did you love me? It's getting pretty late. I got an early start in the morning. You comfortable? Yeah. Good. Well, good night. Good night. [ Sighs ] [ Chattering ] When are you moving back with your dad? I don't know. Probably about a couple of months maybe. Do you like staying at your mom's? Not really. But she's not around that much. What does she do? Well, she drives a big rig, which is a truck, and she goes all over, um, the states, you know. And, uh, right now, she's actually going on a trip to San Diego. She is? Yeah. What are you doing after school? All right, do you know what a whippet is? [ Hissing ] [ Hissing ] Okay, okay, okay. First time, keep it easy. [ Laughing ] [ Laughing Continues ] What the hell are you doing? Oh, shit. You, who the hell are you? Out! Get the hell out. Out. Ah, fuck this. But this is my house too. The hell it is. Jesus. - You're bullshit. - You're bullshit, all right? Oh, yeah? Yeah. You see what happened to me? [ Spraying ] Oh, shit! Oh, you little fucker! You get-- [ Peter ] Oh, fuck! Ohh! Yes, you better run! Oh, shit! Run! Run! You little bastard. Well, at least he's got a friend. Yeah, I don't know. He wanted to stay over there tonight, but I didn't think it was such a good idea. Well, don't let it bother you. Kids do shit like that all the time. Hell, I did it. Look how I turned out. Inspire me, why don't you? Shit. What do you know about raising kids? You're barren or sterile or shooting blanks or whatever. You know, sometimes I think you'd just best be served by just... closing your mouth every once in a while, just walk away once in a while. You gotta wife to talk to like that. I'm ain't your wife. Yeah, but you and me are friends. I won't let my other pals talk to me like that. Don't think it's a little strange you and me going out all the time? It's not all the time. We're neighbors, for Christ's sake. It's important for people to have other interests, you know? Friends and such. I'm your only friend, Runner. I got friends, Diane. I got pals I served with. Well, the guys on line down at the V.A. don't count, dude. Oh, wow, you really-- [ Chuckles ] That don't make me feel too good. Just keep on drinking that creamy drink there, Runner. Well, it happens to be in a to-go cup, and I'm to-goin'. Come on. Runner! Hey! What are you littering for? Give a hoot, man. You just can't-- You don't see it. See what? Forget it. Where are you going? You know, I don't care if you just see me as some jerk who follows you around like a dog. What do I care? But damn it, I'm crazy about you, Diane. Well, I'm crazy about you too, Runner. You know that. But I'm not gonna let you get in my underpants. Yeah, why not me? Why every other dumb Joe Blow? It's not every other dumb Joe Blow. We've been hanging around for four years. We've been going out. We've been palling around. And I-- You-- You can be really nasty sometimes. But I've never thought about a woman the way I think about you. Well, go ahead. I'm waiting for the commentary. Hell, Runner, I'm not gonna say anything. I better go. [ TV: Indistinct ] [ Man Whistling ] I got a secret  I shouldn't tell  And I'm gonna go to heaven in a  In a split-pea shell  Lordie me  Didn't we shake sugaree  Everything I have  Down in pawn  You know I pawned my watch  I pawned my chain, yeah  And I'd of sold myself  But I felt ashamed  Lordie me  Didn't we shake up sugaree  Everything I have  Down in pawn  [ Cheering, Applauding ] [ Boy ] Okay, let's do it! Yes, get a hit! Hey, you made it. Yeah. [ Cheering, Applauding ] [ Woman ] Let's go! Let's go! Yeah! [ Man ] Okay. Come on, Robert! What the hell you doing drinking at a kids' game? I'm not drinking per se. I'm just celebrating life. Anyhow, it's in a bag. Peter, let's go! You can do it! Okay, let's a hit! Come on, Peter! [ Woman ] Let's go, Cal! That's good pitching! Home run! [ Umpire ] Strike one. He needs to choke up a little. He'll be all right. [ Man ] Watch it, Peter. [ Boy ] Come on! Come on, Peter! Let's go! Strike two! [ Cheering, Applauding ] All right, last one. Come on, dude. [ Diane ] Go, little man! Whoo! [ Boy #1 ] Come on, Pete! [ Boy #2 ] Come on, Peter! [ Boy #3 ] Let's go, Peter! [ Boy #4 ] Come on, Pete. [ Man ] It's all you, Peter. Yeah! Go! [ Man ] Go! Go! Go! [ Diane ] That's it! Go! Shit! [ Umpire ] That's an out! Game's over. What the hell's he doing? Hey! Over here! Did you see me? I hit it. Yeah. I saw it. Kept your eye on the ball. [ Runner ] Hey, come on. Don't be talkin' like that. [ Phone Rings ] All right, put the porno on and, uh, I'll grab some plates. [ Rings ] Which one you putting in first? Hello? [ Sighs ] Nice. This is Diane. 'Cause if it's a scary movie I gotta have a blanket. It's gotta cover my feet. Yeah. And it has to wrap underneath. It has to be like a taco. I have to be wrapped. I see. A burrito. [ Door Closes ] Hey. Now listen. If my mom was alive or I knew where my dad was, I would-- I would try to fix things up with them, but-- I've been talking to Jenny, and she's gonna take him, Di. But I don't want you to talk to him about it just yet, okay? I'll-- Just let him be. Does she really want him? Wants him enough, I guess. You sent him out to me on purpose. You've known for a long time how sick you were. You know, I wish we could've seen eye to eye on some things, Diane. That would have been cool with me. I just-- I just never knew where I stood. You know, like I was right there with you or making love to you, but you were always somewhere else. I could never get a foothold. There I was. You pulled up in that big bus with your team, you stepped off. I thought I'd never seen a better looking man in all my life. Seemed like you came down from heaven or on a white horse or something. You had your hair slicked back, cut over your left eye. I would've gone just about anywhere with you at that moment, and I guess I did. You did. That's-- That's very true. [ Whispering ] I like that mouth. Your dad wants you to come in now. Your dad wants you, okay? Peter, go on. We'll be right here when you get back. Come on now. Go. Well, I guess you can tell by looking at me I'm not in the best shape of my life. You look all right. You win your game? Come on. Come sit next to me. I got some things that I wanted to talk to you about. How's your throwing? Bad. Yeah, well, I wasn't so good at throwing either. Or batting, for that matter. You like your mom? No. You love her though, right? I don't know. [ Sighs ] Now I gotta tell you this, sweetheart. I'm not so sure that I'm gonna be seeing you around again before too long. Now me and you, we've been together since you were a baby, right? That's a long time. That's a-- That's a real long time. You know, when you first came out of your mom, well... it was the happiest day of my life. Now here, here. Stop-- Stop playing with your fingers for a second and look at me, okay? No. Now listen to me good, okay? [ Sniffles ] I want you to try and be a good man, if you can. And I don't mean giving quarters to homeless people or whatever. I'm-- I'm talking about... treating people right, you know? Or... I don't know, standing up for people that need you. Even if you're-- Even if you're scared. All right, do you know what I'm saying? No. You do those things. Maybe if all goes well, I'll be sure to see you before too long, all right? Okay, now, go get Jenny, 'cause she needs to make some calls. No! Go on. Go-- Go get Jenny. No, Daddy! [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing ] [ Woman ] Wilderness song  Kids and a clown  Lanky boys with  Big mouths  My staircase  A vow leans against my cloud  And all your wanderin'  Wanderin' about  Well, it tells me  I should have bones to pick with you  And I should feel the need to kill  Against you Yes  I should have bones to pick with you  I don't have no  I don't have no bones  Mmm, grubby hands  My itchy finger  And the tonal tunes and  And their tidy singers What  Oh, I should have bones to pick  Oh, I don't have no  I don't have no bones  [ Strumming ] [ Diane ] But that run is mine, Frank. I am dependable. Listen, my kid's dad just died. [ Continues ] Yeah, sure, that would be fun. No, a drink would be great. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. [ Continues ] You sound like a real rock star in there. [ Dog Barking In Distance ] Listen, I'm gonna need you to go stay with Jenny another weekend in, uh, L.A., okay? Next weekend. I'm gonna go do Reno. [ Continues ] [ Crowd Cheering, Applauding ] Out! Peter! [ Man ] Who's up? Who do we got? [ Man #2 ] Let's go! Next batter! [ Crowd Applauding ] Hey! Hi. That was great. Thanks. Hey, Peter. How are you? Hi, Jenny. I thought you weren't coming until tomorrow. Where's Runner? Bringing the truck around. Listen, Peter, I've gotta work tomorrow afternoon, so I was thinking we just drive back to L.A. tonight. Well, me and the team are gonna go get some pizza. I got a call a few hours ago to make another run after Reno. Where? Boston. Where's Boston. It's gonna be a couple extra days, so maybe you wanna stay out there with Jenny a little while longer, okay? How long? A few days. Just an extra few days. And then we'll see. Okay? See what? Hey. Hey. Hey. It's just a few days. A few days, okay? Listen to me. You can go back and be with your friends, all right? You can stay in your old house. You can have a better life. You can be with people who love you. See, I am who I am, all right? This is who I am. I'm always gonna be like this. Like what? Like this. Jenny is a really nice woman. I don't want a nice woman. [ Engine Starts ] I'll be back in a week or so. Just play it by ear or something. Okay, Diane. He's a good boy. I know. How you doing, Jenny? [ Sighs ] To tell you the truth, I'm pretty fucking sad. I'll bring him by in the morning. He'll be fine. Good night, Diane. Yeah. You did good tonight. [ Sighs ] I could have been a good dad, maybe. Maybe still could. What? Nothing. [ Sighs ] You look real pretty tonight. Yeah? Yeah. Thanks. I like your legs. Never get to see 'em much. Actually I don't think I ever seen 'em. Yeah? My legs? Yeah. What else do you like about me? I like your knees. My knees are a part of my legs, the part that makes them bend. Well, can't it just be me saying something? Just say something else then. You already got my legs covered. What would you say if I leaned in a little right now? I guess I'd tell you when you got here. Not sure if I like it. No? Maybe a little closer. Can't quite get the full bouquet of the whiskey. [ Chuckles ] No. Diane, I'm sorry. No, it's not you. I just don't want to live like that anymore. Like what? Kinda half-assed, you know? Not thinking things through. I mean, you got Molly, she's okay, but damned if you're ever gonna leave her. I don't know what I'm doing. But whatever it is maybe I've gotta think about my future more... than just what city I'm running a load of two-by-fours to, you know? You know what I mean, Runner? Not all the way. But, yeah, I gotcha. I can support you on that. You better go. He's gonna be home soon. You gonna say something? Uh... Ah, hell, Diane, you got the most beautiful tits I ever laid hands on. Well, if nothing else, you-- you're a true gentleman. [ Engine Starts ] Stay out of trouble. [ Clanging ] Hey! What are you guys doing? How was the game? Get out of here. [ Clears Throat ] Mmm. Wow. Okay. Here you go. What, are you looking at something? [ Chuckles ] What are you looking at? Are you fucking looking at something? Nothing. Nothing. I got my kid coming home. Nothing. Mmm. Look at me. No, look. Look at me. I said I got my kid coming home. If you get out of here right now, I won't call the cops. Okay. Okay. You fucker! Bitch! Get up! Come on! Ahh! Ahh! Look at me! Huh? Look at me! I'm looking at you! I'm fucking looking at you! Ow! Fuck! Ahh! Goddamn it! No! No! See, I have a son, all right? I don't want him coming in on this, all right? Listen, my truck's parked outside. All right? Take me outside. In the truck. In the truck. In the truck. Oh, God! My son! No! Goddamn it! Get the fuck off her! Jesus! That is not what I am! That is not what I am! Diane! Diane. This is my house. Get out of my house! Get out of my house! [ Panting ] Peter. Those guys that were just here-- [ Sobbing ] [ Cigarette Lighter Clicks Open ] [ Clicks Closed ] [ Cars Passing By On Freeway In Distance ] [ Whispering ] The freeway's really loud. Sometimes it puts me to sleep like waves at a beach. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Are you? Yeah. Do you want me to go with Jenny? Do you wanna go with Jenny? [ Sighs ] That's not what I asked you. No, I don't want you to go with Jenny. Do you want me to stay with you? Will you say it? I want you to stay with me. What can I call you then? Anything you want. Okay. Okay.
