Back home this guy is the biggest of the big baddies. I know people who wouldn't even say his name out of fear that they would lose their firstborn. Pss. What kind of name is rumpelstiltskin anyway. Alice: Alright, you two - stay mum. Here he comes, the squirrely bugger. Remember, Piper, dear- he's expecting a dealer named hans to give him a piece of the magic mirror. And where he goes... Death's messengers are never far behind. Where's hans? Couldn't make it. He sent me. I'm Piper. Did - did you bring it? It's nearby. You fiending, pal? Careful, Piper. If you know hans, then you know why I need it. -Sure. Sure. You're running out of juice and you need a taste of the good stuff. Great a magic mirror. Ground up for? What do you snort it? Do you have it ?! Anything for rumpelstiltskin-- hey sshh! Sshh! Don't move. This is new. Where is it, huh? Where is it! I told you, it's nearby. Alice. Alice: Piper's fine. Stay put. I don't want him in that blonde head of yours, too. Where did you hear that name? Hans. You're lying. Hans would never tell you that name. Do you know why? Because I told him not to. Just like I can tell you to give me what I need. Then do it. Give it to me now! Oh, oh. You lost your juice, pal? No, no, no, no, no, no, not now. Who sent you? Was it them? Who is them? Death: Rumpelstiltskin. Goldie: Alice something's happening. Alice: It's him. Death or one of his messengers. Alice: His powers are gone! After him! He can't move. Did you think you could hide from him? You were supposed to bring him the magic mirror. You broke it. And you cheated him. Death doesn't like to be cheated. Next time tell him to read the fine print. Tell him yourself. Male #1: Alice, blood. Curiouser and curiouser. We've made a delightful mess of things, haven't we? Let's not dally, now. It's through the looking glass for you. Is this thing on? Hats off to our newly arrived guest. I'm sure you have oh so many questions, but for now, a word of advice: Don't try too terribly hard to keep your head some would say, to survive here you'd have to be mad as a hatter. Most people think me quite mad. Monsters and magic. Uncommon nonsense they say. Perhaps I am mad. Why sometimes I've believed as many as 6 impossible things before breakfast. But... I've seen wonder. Mad or not, you're quite real. Someone needs to make sure you're not being naughty. After all, it was you who turned the fabric of reality into something not unlike Swiss cheese, I'm afraid. So sorry you're unable to speak. I prefer to be absolutely certain you've lost your powers of persuasion, before loosening up that silver tongue of yours. A reminder, dear Alice, our good Piper's just returned from a jaunt at the zoo and he's brought a guest. And miss goldilocks stepped out for her date. When she returns we'll be near to bursting and all before tea time! Seeing as your restraint, I'm sure he needn't tell you but keep your appendages appended by keeping them to yourself. Else they're likely to be bit off by what's behind below. Alice: Your new cellmate, as it were. This big baddie was our first recruit. That's a good Wolfie. First of many! Before I remember, will one of the tweedles please forget to give the good doggie a proper housing? That little lemon's gone a tadripe. As you can see, your meddling's brought all sorts of grim beasties and monsters from your world to mine. Unfortunately, you also let something else in. Something worse. Alice: A cult. Armed, trained working for death himself. Death's messengers. I think you know them. Judging by your friend in the alleyway. Alice: They're planning something and it's up to us to stop them. I'll be clear. Whether I allow you to speak or not depends entirely on what you're willing to say. Alice: Tell me everything you know about these messengers. If you cooperate I can make your stay here a tad more comfortable. Perhaps even you won't have to eat through a straw for the rest of your life, hmm? Otherwise, breaking the magic mirror will bring you more than just seven years bad luck, I'm afraid. Alice: We'll keep rounding up monsters. You can decide whether you want to be one or not. Blink twice if you've understood me. And blink twice if we have a deal. Hmm. Suit yourself. I'll leave you to think about it. Piper: You sure you want to go alone, Goldie? Golding: He's expecting an escort. I don't want him running off before I have a chance to take him in. Piper: I don't think this guy scares easily. You'd be lucky to land one hit. Goldie: One is all I need. How tough could he be with a name like bluebeard? I asked for a brunette. Ha! Ha! Naughty little girl. Blondes have more fun. Ah, we'll see. Yes, you've met my wives. No one's ever... Hit me before. You must be special. I'm going to take my time. Better hurry up then. I knew I only had one shot to land a hit. So I made it count. Poison should only take a minute or two. Give or take. Alright, bring them in. Piper: Rumpelstiltskin, yeah, his mouth definitely was one of ours. Where we're from he's a bit of a bogeyman. A powerbroker. Literally, actually. Traded influence for favors. Delusions of grandeur, for sure, but never quite got power of his own. A whisper from him and a king would hand over his crown. An army would retreat. At least that was before he broke the magic mirror. It was a gateway between worlds. He could've used it to go anywhere. But he broke it. Somehow tied himself to it and he needs it or he is powerless. Honestly, I don't get it. If his powers aren't working then he's just a glorified conman. Why do you want him? It's not what he can do that I'm interested in, it's what he knows. Who he knows. I'm convinced he wants something from these messengers. Or perhaps more likely, that they want something from him. Yeah. Yeah, he was pretty spooked back in the alley. I got to go with Alice on this one, Goldie. If you say so. Who's next? The big bad wolf. Got a temper on him. Didn't recognize him from back home, but I know the type. Found him at the zoo, of all places. He was eating the animals. You didn't see what he did to those poor little pigs. Took six tranq darts just to bring him down. I thought I was going to lose my head. What? You've seen worse? I've lived with worse. Hmm. Goes by bluebeard, obvious reasons. He has a set of blades he calls his wives. Somehow it makes him stronger every time he kill someone. Goldie: When I picked one up i could feel the life force of everyone he killed. Almost like it was flowing through me making me stronger. But he only kills women? A lot of them. Is that you in there, Goldie? Huh? Oh, he quite fancies you, doesn't he? Yes, it is you. Since those bears didn't tear you apart, come sleep in my bed, Goldie. You okay with him being here? Goldie. He doesn't scare me. When I signed up for this, it was to get rid of guys like this, not start a collection. Fire with fire and all of that. If we were to be beat the messengers, sooner or later, we'll need some monsters of our own. It's only a matter of time. Yes. Alice: It's a start. Get back out there, you two. We've reports of missing persons turning up half eaten. If I had to guess I'd say 'witch' if possible, I'd have you find her before her next meal. Piper: It smells like the place. Goldie: I hate witches. Careful, Piper. We're here to catch a witch. Table for two, huh. She shouldn't be far from whatever this is. Piper: Goldie, he's a messenger. Piper: What would a witch want with one of death's messengers? Goldie: Piper! Goldie: Hold still! Witch: He's miiiine! Oh, I'm sorry am interrupting? Do I know you? Looking glass, right? Am I right? Death: Hi I'm death, ruler of the underworld, reaper of souls, nice to meet you in the flesh. Well, in this guy's flesh. Tell Alice I said "hi." My love. You're here. You heard me. And now we can be together. Hmm. And who might you be? Death: You killed one of my messengers, didn't you? You did, didn't you? Death: Naughty girl. Death: Yeah. I - I - I dreamt of you, my love. Of a new underworld. Suffer. Shh. It takes a certain kind of crazy to court death. I only wanted... To help. I think you have. Mission accomplished. Goldie: Let's bag her up. Ladies, gentlemen, and men. May we welcome another guest to the party. Apologizes for the neck restraint. Make you much less, munchier than you were before. Her name is carabosse. Cannibal witch. I - I don't even know where to start. She's in love with death. He knew who you were, and we were. Goldie: Somehow she was able to help him possess a messenger corpse. Goldie: Alice, death... seemed almost happy to see us. Alice: Then let's figure out if she's part of death's plan. Clock's ticking, after all. Oh, splendid. We're making an impression. Carabosse: Hellooo, rumpelstiltskin. They found you. Ah, there you are. I'd like to show you something. Months now, we have been chasing down these messengers while you've been running around for what's left of that mirror. There's nothing magical about you at all, is there? Picked this up from one of their nasty little rituals. I suspect you know what it is. What it can do? I'd like you to tell me so we have some chance of stopping them. I've had my suspicions. You've run dry. Why else would you be so desperate to get your hands on that little bit of extra power. Unless there's something out there that scares you more than me? I like this one. She's feisty. Good little pets. Yes. Tweedledee: Uh oh. Tweedledee: I'm coming. Ah, yes my little pet. Good night. Good night, twiddle..Dee? Contrawise, I'm dum. Of course you are. I'll get it next time. Tweedleddum: She killed him! Killed my bother! -Alice: Where is she? Alice: How did this happen? It's not like you don't have a spare. Alice: Not another word! Never hurt no one nohow... I know. I know. -Alice: We must find her. Alice: Before she causes any more damage... No, no, no, no. She must have cut the feed somehow. Why wouldn't she just leave? Why indeed. There must be something she wants. You remember that little resurrection trick she did. The morgue? -Yeah. I'm gonna go check it out. -Good, go. Would you like to sit this tumble out, love? Contrawise, mum. That's a good boy. Off to the armory with you, then. Lock the doors and watch for witches. This one is in love with death. If she's still lurking about I've no doubt she'd head there next looking for his scythe. Which reminds me, collect rumpelstiltskin and meet me upstairs. Wake up, wake up, my love. Oh, it's you again. So this is looking glass. Wait! My love. You need me! And? Let me... Make you whole. And how do you plan of doing that, witch? Here. Here is everything you need for the ritual. I can perform it. Please? So this is where they have my scythe? Yeah. I can feel it. Yes. Yes, it's here. But, I brought you a little gift. Not what you seek... ...but who you seek. You need to seek a mint. I hope you're pleased with yourself. Tweedledee was a kind and gentle boy and it's your selfish meddling which got him killed. A fact I'm very much aware of. Now... I know you know more than you're letting on. If I find you've kept anything from me that would have saved his life... I'll have your head. Everything almost ready. Just send your messengers and let me take care of the rest. Oh they're on their way, alright. Death: Find my scythe! Kill every one of them, and bring me 'stiltskin! First messenger that bags me a monster gets to skip a circle of hell. Goldie here. We're breached. Lock it down. I'm securing the prisoners. Stay sharp. We don't know how many there are. Bluebeard. Oh no. -You didn't think I'd leave without saying goodbye, did you? You remember my wives, don't you? They remember you. Let's have a threesome. Bad doggie. Alice: Apologies for leaving but we're in a spot of bother at present. Death has come and found us wanting, I'm afraid. As you can see, we're under attack and I'm a tad shorthanded. You're either with us or not. I'm hoping these insure the former. Picked them up in wonderland, all though I fear I don't recall how. Quite explosive. My little insurance policy. It's time for you to prove your usefulness. Sorry I can't wait around for you to come to your senses on your own time. You see, sense is rather useless sentiment with so much senselessness afoot. You work for me now. If you try to leave, I'll kill you. If you try to remove it, I'll kill you. As a matter a fact, if you do anything I don't like, I'll kill you. Blink twice if we have a deal. Splendid. Now, you have a visitor. Alice: I believe you've met "her majesty," queen of hearts? Your first task is to get her to wear this. Welcome to looking glass. Hel-lo? Gelda, baby! Rumpy! What are you doing here? Rumpy: How long has it been? -Gelda: Oh, don't pretend like you don't know! What's going on out there? -It's the messengers, the place is crawling with them. It's going to be like herding mice getting rid of... Who is she? She's one of mine. So she's nuts? Apparently the two of them used to be an item if that tells you anything. Rumpy, you look terrible. Why am I not surprised to find you between yet another rock and a hard place? How did you know I was here? Oh, I always like to know right where you are. I couldn't let anything happen to my little rumpy. What have you gotten yourself into? Well, it's been a little rough since the last time I saw you. Apparently, if you've thrown in with this lot. Gelda: You know, that Alice is quite batty, don't you? So maybe we can take this reunion to the cell block? Considering we're a little exposed here? We're reasonably safe if she's near. She's unhinged, unpredictable, and unfortunately something of a secret weapon. Alice: If she's going to help, we'll need him to convince her. She can control them. Any man, really. Any man but him. Oh, trust me... She's nuts! Completely insane. And she's got me by the balls, gelda. Oh, does she? Oh, yes. Right under her thumb. Well, we can't have that. You could have escaped whenever you wanted to. Why didn't you? Leave. When we found you, you were eating zoo animals for food. Is that because you didn't want to hurt people? All I do is hurt people. Right now that's a talent we can use. Tell me, what is it that she wants from you? Oh she thinks I have something to do with death and his messengers. And do you? -Of course not! But she won't help me unless i help her stop them. If I'm going to get out of this, i need your help. Of course you do! And I can leave anytime I want, darling. But I can't. I need your help. Please, baby. What do you need me to do? I need you to put this on. That's mine! Oh no! Goodbye, rumpy! You're on your own! Call me if you make it out of this. Do I have to beg? Then beg! Gelda, my queen, my love... Do you love me? What's not to love? Yes! Yes, I love you! But you left me. Well, you did marry a king. King of the morons and the crazies. I hate crazy! I hate it! Rumpy, I was so boring without you. You were supposed to come visit. And I waited and I waited for you to get your hands on that mirror and you broke it. Oh, I'm sorry. That was an accident, really, baby. I never really wanted to be here... With her. I'd rather much be here with you. I'm waiting. Gelda, queen of hearts, queen of my heart. Please, show me kindness. Stay, baby. You know I could never be apart from you. You're lucky I've always had a soft spot for you. Sometimes I wonder how much of that was real and how much of that was mind control. Oh, gelda. You and I both know... I could never control you. Nor I you. Awe. So you agree to help? I do. Splendid! It's official. You sure you want to strap bombs to these nut jobs? Alice: Let's not think too much about it, shall we? What now then? Alice: Now we let the monsters out. Rumpy:...Sitting pretty. - Piper: Oh yeah. - -Gelda: Alice: Alright beasties, time to earn your keep. We've some unwanted guests and I'd like the lot of you to help me shoo them away. Oh no, what now? Alice: Gelda, darling, meet bluebeard. Alice: He's a nasty one. He'll need a little of your "convincing." I'd like him in goldilock's care. She's no stranger to brutes. Why would I help you? Is this our naughty boy? Alice: I don't like it any more than you do. But I'm without options at present. Well, I would love to slaughter all of you. It'd be fun. You'll help because I tell you too, silly. You'll be a good boy and do everything miss goldilocks here tells you to. Goldie: Don't worry. Won't you? Yes. Are you a good boy, now? Are you a good boy? A good boy. Perfect. Piper: Alice, if she can mind control him like that, any reason why we can't just put her on the pa and tell these guys to back off? Unfortunately, her charms only work in person. How do you do it anyway? Some of us are natural leaders, darling. Alice: Goldilocks, dear. What about our Wolfie? Can I trust you? No. Then trust me. Goldie: He'll be fine. Alice: That settles that, then. Rumpelstiltskin? Tell us what you know. Thought you'd never ask. Well... He calls himself death . Total hack. He runs a shit show called "the underworld." You see he's just a hustler. He does something for you, you do something for him, he gets your soul for the underworld. Now, a while back he asked me to get a hold of something for him. The old magic mirror. He wanted to use it to come here and take over, so I broke it. And now he's just stuck there and can't get anything done anywhere else without acting through his cult. Death's messengers. Oooohhh, scary! But, they're just people that can be killed. Luckily, you're all excellent killers. If he's here, it's because he knows you have the scythe. If they get it to that witch, she'll be able to perform a ritual to summon death here to this realm. And that my friends would be a real problem. Death and decay, spreading like a cancer, hmm? Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And that's why we're going to stop him. Excuse me? And why you're all going to help. Attention death's messengers, we're not afraid of you. We know what you're after and you'll never get your bony hands on it I'm afraid. Alice: You're about to find out what we've been keeping in our basement. This is your last warning. Yo, mice! Leave my facility or you won't like what happens next. That is all. Thank you. Finally. What's your plan to get this thing off? What do you mean? -What do you mean what do I mean? Oh I can't imagine that you're here and you don't have a plan. You do have a plan, right? Yes. Well, I'm working on it. Ever wonder if keeping a basement full of monsters was a bad idea? Constantly. You good here? I'm off to my witch hunt. -I got these two. - Goldie: Bluebeard is having his fun. Goldie: And the wolf is, well he's working out some anger issues. At least it's not mice . Oh, rumpy, I am very disappointed. No, no, no, no, no listen. Just bide our time and find ourselves in the armory. What for? The magic mirror. She's got some locked up with that big fat idiot. Enough for one last shot of the ol' magic. At least enough to make her let me go. Oh, but then, clearly you don't need me then. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, gelda, baby. Come on! It's your little rump roast, please. Wake up. This? This is your plan? I'm running out of messengers here, witch. See how desperate she is? Desperate enough to let rumpelstiltskin out of his hidey-hole. So they're working together? That's adorable. Listen, seriously. We just have to see this through, right? Play her game and make her think she's in charge. If you believe that, you're even madder than she is. Gelda, wait! Drop it. What? Oh, rumpy. You do care! You like that, don't you baby? I want to talk to 'stiltskin. Want to make that happen? Oh, yes. Carabosse: Yes. Maybe you're not as useless as I thought, huh? Piper: 'Sup, witch? Owe you one, Piper. Goldie: Bluebeard. Down boy. Keep your paws off her. She belongs to me. -Shut up. Goldie: No! Don't hurt him! Hey! Hey. Trust me, remember? It's okay. It's okay. There's still more of you, okay? We... I need you. Goldie: Snap out of it. Goldie: Better yet, use it. Goldie: This isn't over. I'm sorry. I warned you. Be careful. I'll tear this whole place down. - There's still a bunch of them upstairs. How did we do? -Shut it! Yes, mum. Did you have an accident? How about a pooper scooper? Mustn't dally now. Taking too long. Mustn't waste time. Alice: You're late, you're late, you're late. You've gone and mucked things up, Alice. Trading monsters for messengers, and more are coming to join the fun. You've figured out the players, but not the game. You know who loves games, don't you, Alice? Oh, god. Alice: Goldilocks, if you could be so kind, it's just occurred to me that we're missing a guest. Bring me hatter. Hatter. Cuppa? Aren't there usually four of you? All in all not bad. But I'd be surprised if that was the last of the messengers. I imagine it wasn't. You're back to witch duty. Apologies, love, seems it's going to be a long night. Off you pop. Yes, mum. Hatter. -Gelda: Alice? Well we all had a good, bloody time on your behalf and you should be pleased. So, what do you say we take these off, yes? Absolutely not. Rumpy! You said if I played along that she'd take these away. Gelda, baby it's just so Alice here feels safe. Do you feel safe? I doubt very much she'd blow me up with all of us standing here! Don't be so certain. I'm getting bored of this game! Pretty soon I won't want to play anymore. You're killing me, here. Imagine going home to that every night. Hatter... I need you to take a little trip for me, love. Oh, what fun. Where are we going? Well, the underworld, I'm afraid. Oh well then, that'll take a nip of the good stuff. I thought you might say that. Alice: No better 'trip' outside of wonderland. Are you really doing this, Alice? Oh, don't worry about hatter, dear. This'll be mild compared to what he got up to in wonderland. Goldie: If you say so. What's wrong? - Are you serious? I can't believe she's doing this. Desperate times, Goldie. Alice took us in and for a while everything felt just right. Lately I'm wondering if we made a mistake in trusting her. Classic goldilocks. I'm serious, Piper. I know! -Well then, act like it. I am. Look. I'm going to go back to my witch hunt and I'm going to go check on tweedle...Dum? His brother is dead, Piper. It's not funny anymore. We'll get through this, Goldie. Okay? Remember hatter, the underworld. I need to know what death is planning. Hatter: Yes, yes, yes. - Do you think you can do that for me? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I always fancy a tumble down the ol' rabbit hole, dear. Alright then, sit back. Hatter: Oh yes... Bad vibes here, dear Alice. Taste like... Mutiny. Murder. Malice. Have I made a rhyme? Hatter: I feel like to pop. Hatter: Good stuff. He'll be like this for some time. Psst. Hey buddy. Seen any witches? Contrawise. If the witch was here, you won't need ask, nohow. Listen, I'm sorry about your brother. I know I wasn't the nicest to him, but you know-- it's okay. Keep your head up high, big guy. Alright. Okay. Alright, buddy. How long is this gonna take? There's nasty business afoot this evening, Alice, my dear. Yes, hatter. We know. What nasty business? What are they looking for? Best be quick like now. They nearly have everything they need. What do they need, hatter? The prickly thing. The scythe. And the proper attire, of course. Attire? For what? Hatter, what attire? For the grand party, of course. But you won't like the guest list. Death is coming. And he has grand plans for you. Grand, grand, big funny plans. What does he mean? What does death want with you? I want to stop him as much as you do. Where's gelda? Alice: Goldilocks, be a dear and head outside to check the roof. Gelda, darling, don't make me blow you up, sweetheart. Gelda, come back. Rumpy: Gelda, come back. Alice: Gelda, I'm not joking. Not one more step. No, no, no. Let me talk to her. I can give her the rumpy noodle. Come on. Alright, buddy. Okay. Alright, big guy. That's good. Tweedledum: You're okay. Tweedledum! That's far enough! Hmm. Like me, now. And off with your head! Uh-uh. Oh, which one is that? That's tweedledum. Hmm. Drop it. Drop it. Open it. Take a hike, pipsqueak. Gelda, I will blow you up! Well, go ahead then. She's in the armory. That's it. If we're lucky she'll take that scythe with her. -No, no, no, no, no, please. Let me talk to her. Let me go and get her. You two are pals, right? You remember the magic mirror? The last time I broke something like that, it got us into this whole mess in the first place. But the scythe is even more powerful. No one knows what will happen if it goes off. Please. Alice, come on. Fine. Ten minutes or I will kill you both. Good, I can make it work. Why do you care? Because I love her. Of course. Tonight is the night, my love. Only if you keep your promise, witch. I will. I will. Oh yeah? Then do it. Piper : Gotcha. Look what I found. Alice: Just the witch i wanted to see. Alice, tweedledum...He... Two down. Hatter. I could use a riddle about now. Alice, you don't seem much of the riddling sport. Hatter, something's happened. We've lost another friend. Perhaps we ought to lose one more. Alice... Bring me one of the bodies. The messengers? Yes. Go. Okay. Wake him up. I want to talk to him. What makes you think he wants to talk to you? Because I want to offer him a deal. So... Is this the part where one of us says "so we finally meet at last?" We finally meet at last. What do you got for me? A consolation prize really. You see, we'll never let you have your little ceremony. Forget your interest in this realm... And I'll give you rumpelstiltskin. Hmm, stiltskin. Did I getcha? Anyway, I just had the most interesting conversation with the rabbit chaser. You got to hear about it. You... You. Ha. You caused me some trouble, bud. Look, buddy. Can you scroll me to the bottom here? Kind of on the clock here courtesy of Alice. You know she tried to trade you? She? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She offered you right up. To be fair, ii should say, you know, her world for your worthless life. But there's no question there. There's no trust between you two. Ironically, she still has no idea that you are way more valuable to me than you are to her. So what do you want, huh? Spit it out. What do I want, what do I want, what do I want. What I've always wanted... Before you broke the mirror. Hey, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta...Accident. Hey, there are set backs. It's cool, baby. I'm flexible. I got a backup plan. You. How is that? These bodies...They're... So fragile. They deteriorate so quickly but, not you. No, see, you've had real power. You just pissed it all away and now you're just scrambling to get it back. See in your body, in your body I'd be permanent. Whole. Look, buddy... I'm not seeing the silver lining here, pal. You give me your body. I'd rather let Alice blow me up. And you get the underworld. Now we're talking. Al. We have the witch. The scythe. And Goldie will be back soon. There could be only so many messengers out there. Then tell me this: If we've won, why is she so tickled? Look. You've always wanted to be more than just a lapdog. Yeah. -Real power. A kingdom of your own. -Yeah. So be my lapdog. Trade me your body. I'll rule this realm and you can have my scraps. I'm sick of the underworld, man. It's time for me to move on. It's a good fit for you though. Considering, well, obviously. What if I say... No. Well, Alice will lock you up and I know just where to find you. And I will keep coming and coming and coming. The underworld has no shortage of souls, brother. Trust me on that. Nobody wants to die. Eventually, she's going to find out and she's just going to kill you. Then I'll just have to find another way. Just come on. Save me the headache. Alice will kill me anyway if I say yes. Lot'a good my body'll do you if she blows it up. So then we got to make it look real good then, don't we? Something funny is going on and I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. How puzzling. All these changes. I don't know who I am from one minute to the next. Running as fast as I can just to stay in one place. I'm afraid if I don't find out soon, I'll do something quite rash. Alice? Piper, be a dear and head upstairs for me? Where am I going? The armory, of course. I'll not gain a pawn only to sacrifice my queen. Okay. Rumpy, dear, I'm feeling quite tested. I hope you're not plotting. I mean it now. Your ten minutes is almost up. If you don't bring gelda right back down here then I'm afraid you'll leave me no choice but to blow you both! Best not be late. Rumpy: Where is it? -Gelda: What took you so long? Rumpy: Where is it? -Gelda: Where were you? Excuse me? No 'thank you?' thank you for what? Is this what you're looking for? Did I do good? I did, didn't I? You did great, baby. I want it like old times, rumpy. When it was just you and me and everybody did what we said. And no Alice. I want it like that too, baby. But someone has to stop death. Let her deal with it. Rumpy, let's run away together! Gelda, I can't run anymore. You don't understand. -No. I don't think you understand. He'll never stop. Don't you know? Death always catches up to you. Now, I have a plan for both of us to get out of this, together. You just need to give me that vial and trust me. Gelda. Please. This is the one thing that can get me out of this. Wrong. I'm the one that can get you out of this. Me! And, it's time you start acting like it. Gelda, stop! You're right. You're absolutely right, baby. I love you. Now let's just take that, and go to Alice and just give me-- where were you? What? What do you mean? You better tell me now? Okay, okay, okay. It was him. It was death, alright? He offered me a deal I didn't like, so I didn't take it. What deal? Gelda, please. A trick. A trick, alright? I give him my body, and he lets me take the underworld. Eww. Exactly, now come on. So you turned him down then? For me? Yes, of course. So that we can be together, forever. Yes. --Promise me. Gelda... I promise. If this works out -- -- if? I promise. We'll be together. Forever. I love you. Rumpy: I'm sorry, gelda. It had to look believable. It was the only way. Goldie: It's a robe. That must be the 'attire' hatter saw. Let's get out of there and do this quietly. Come on, bluebeard. Are you a good boy? A good boy? Good boy. Goldilocks dear, please do return soon as you can. Sick 'em. Where's bluebeard? As much as I would love to tear her apart... Why don't you show me that wild side you been trying so hard to keep at bay. Are you okay? Where's the robe? Goldie: Come on. Where's the robe? Run! Hey is just me remember? We have to get back inside and help! Run! I'm afraid that's as far as i can trust you, rumpelstiltskin. Piper: He's here! He's here! Please don't blow him up. Aren't you supposed to be the master plotter here? What's happening? What's their game? Alice, we really need to talk. -No. You need to tell me what's going on or else I don't think I have a need for you anymore. As a matter of fact, I think i like you better back in your cell. Listen, if you want to stop for good then I have to tell you something, and you're really going to have to trust me. You must think me mad. All you've done is lie. Why should I trust you? Honestly, if this was your plan, no wonder death dumped your ass. Good evening, Piper, I'll take that. Aah! Piper! Wait! That one, we need alive. You're not any fun. Bluebeard: I believe this is what you need. I want in. Rumpelstiltskin? Rumpelstiltskin? Chin up Piper, we'll figure something out. So this is where you've been hiding? You gotta admit, it's pretty funny how things work out sometimes, huh? You. I'm so sorry. You must be feeling so out of the loop right now. Well let me catch you up to speed. See after our conversation, i had another little chat... With this guy. What does he mean? Oh! What do I mean, what do I mean, what do I mean, what do I mean is it's time for you to come through on your end of the deal. Death: Man. You will do anything to wiggle yourself out of trouble. Am I right? Even killing the only woman who ever really loved you. You're real scum. I gotta respect that. Booboo? Come here, girl! Come here, girl! Come, girl! Come, girl... stay! See, I forgot to mention... Consider this a way to seal our deal. Call it my signature. Death: Any objections? Death: No? Well then let's start this ritual, huh? Come here. Please, stop. I can't! Death: Hey hey! Blueballs is here. Bluebeard is here. Death: Keep your eye out for blondie and her dog. Death: Come on, rumpy. Death: Time for me and you to get real cozy. We don't hurt you. You can't. We good? I'm with you. What's taking so long? The sacrifice must be perfect, my love. The circle must not be broken. Death: Oh my god! Whatever, just hurry up. - Really? Goldie: You take neckbeard, I'll take the others. Ha ha! I'm disappointed, Wolfie. Let me show you how it's done! - Goldilocks, hurry! Goldie! I'm coming, Piper. -Death: Oh, no you don't! Alright, death. Give me something to hit. Alice: Oh no, Alice! Open, dammit! He's lying! He doesn't care about you. -Liar! Death: Witch, let's go. He loves me. Goldie: Get him, hatter! Goldie: Is something wrong, sweetheart? He's using you. Lie! What do you think is gonna happen when this is over, huh? Death will enter rumpelstiltskin for me. And then, we will be together forever. You obviously have no idea what's gonna happen. Death: No more talking. Time for killing. Alice: There you have it. Now, crackle. Alice: I've had enough of you! Are you quite happy? You can't win. You should have possessed a better brawler. Messenger: Nice punch. Do you get a free bowl of porridge with that? Bluebeard: Come here, boy. Cage match, then. Death: Now you're really gonna get it you blondie-- Goldie. It's time. Kill rumpelstiltskin! Piper! You're okay. You're alright. Please be okay. She's a bit much for you, little girl. It's just... Alice: You want to stop him? Alice: I'm trusting you, rumpelstiltskin. No. Alice: Tell me, how do we stop this now? Alice, no! Alice: Don't make me regret this. Alice, what are you doing? Kill him! Blink twice if we have a deal. Rumpelstiltskin! Hurry, this body won't hold. Alice, kill him! I underestimated you. Everyone does. You sold us out, you son of a bitch! I get the underworld, and you get my body as soon as we shake. Don't let them touch! Deal? Deal. What happened? What did you do? What he told me to. He said to blow up the wristband when they shook hands. And I'd be rid of them both. Not like him to sacrifice for the greater good. No, no it's not. - Piper! Did we win? - Piper. How are you alive? Ow. I wonder what rumpelstiltskin got out of the deal? Ah. Messenger: Truce! Alice: Rumpelstiltskin, i presume. So that was your scheme? Rumpy: Aww, look at them. Rumpy: So happy. So alive! Rumpy: Thanks to me, of course. See, things are under "new management" downstairs. It's not as sinister as you assumed, Alice. I gave a few souls back. Maybe you can make something out of them. Your own little sinister squad. You want to make a deal? I already got everything i needed... From you. Rumpy: Consider this a freebie. A peace offering. Don't forget, I know you tried to sell me out. Oh, Alice. You're cleverer than that. Hopefully after this we can trust each other a little more. I tell you what. I can make you a deal. Rumpy: A real no brainer. You keep an eye on everything up there. And I'll keep an eye on things, down here. Better the devil you know, then? Something like that. Too-do-loo wonder-bread. Ah. Ha, ha!
