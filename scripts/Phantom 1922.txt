"YOU'RE TALKING TO THE WRONG PERSON! I HAVEN'T KNOWN WHERE LORENZ IS FOR DAYS NOW." "AND NOW SHOPPING! BUY A HUNDRED THOUSAND THINGS--!" "YOU DON'T SEEM WELL... I WOULD THINK THAT LORENZ WOULD HAVE TAKEN BETTER CARE OF YOU." To Mr. Lorenz Lubota: It is a fact that you have been away from work... ...without an excused absence, that you have frequented and behaved scandalously in questionable taverns... ...and further, that you have harassed highly esteemed citizens of the community. Moreover, your unqualified behaviour towards city clerk Hermann Schraat... ...is considered a serious offense against a public administrator. In view of the above, you are desmissed immediately from your employment with the City... ...and are without claim to any further wages. "WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY WANT? WHY ARE YOU SPYING ON ME? ..." "...YOU'VE NEVER ONCE SHOWN ANY CONCERN FOR ME-- WHY SUDDENLY NOW?" "WHAT DO I WANT HERE? I LENT 60,000 MARKS TO LORENZ-- AND NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S USING IT FOR." "MY LORENZ IS AN HONEST MAN!! HE CAN ANSWER FOR HIS ACTIONS! ..." "...REMEMBER THAT AND LEAVE ME ALONE!" "I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I STAND! I SHALL MAKE INQUIRIES..."

"I BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU, MOTHER." "DID YOU BUY THAT WITH THE MONEY FROM AUNT SCHWABE?" "SHE WAS HERE... SHE ASKED ABOUT YOU... YOU SHOULD GO TO HER TODAY..." "WHY DID YOU WISH TO SPEAK TO ME, AUNT?" "LORENZ, YOU'RE THE BIGGES SCOUNDREL I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY LIFE!" "I'VE MADE SOME INQUIRIES... AND NOW I KNOW WHERE I STAND WITH YOU! ..." "...I DEMAND THE MONEY BACK THAT YOU SWINDLED FROM ME!" "...AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY ANYMORE, AS YOU CLAIM-- WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?" "I DON'T OWE AN AXPLANATION ABOUT HOW AND WHERE I SPEND MY MONEY." "YOUR MONEY? --HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR MONEY! ..." "...--WHAT'S COME OVER YOU? ARE YOU ALL SUDDENLY POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL?!" "YOU EITHER GIVE ME BACK THE MONEY-- OR I'LL HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT HANDING YOU AND YOUR FINE FRIEND OVER TO THE POLICE!" "I'LL GIVE YOU THREE DAYS TO CLEAR THE MATTER UP COMPLETELY, NOT AN HOUR MORE..." "...I'LL TURN THE MATTER OVER TO THE POLICE IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT BY THEN!" "SHE HAS UNCOVERED THE FRAUD... SHE WENT TO SEE MOTHER..." "THE OLD BEAST KNOWS NO PITY WHEN SHE THINKS HER MONEY IS IN DANGER! ..." "...SHE'LL BREAK YOUR NECK WITHOUT MERCY!" "YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE THE OLD BAG TO THE CLEANERS A SECOND TIME-- WITH FORCE IF NECESSARY!" "I'D RATHER STAND IN THE TOWN SQUARE AND PUBLICLY ADMIT MY MISTAKES AND DO PENANCE!" "DO YOU THINK DOING THA WILL GET THE MONEY BACK?" "I WANT TO PAY THE MONEY BACK! I WANT TO PAY BACK EVERY NICKEL AND DIME!" "FROM WHAT? FROM YOUR INCOME AS A DISCHARGED CLERK-- OR FROM YOUR POET'S ROYALTIES?" "I CAN'T BREAK AWAY FROM HER! I CAN'T BREAK AWAY FROM HER!" "CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M ON THE BRINK OF INSANITY? SO PLEASE HELP ME! WHY DON'T YOU HELP ME--?" "IF I COULD HELP YOU... IF I COULD RELEASE YOU... THEN I WOULDN'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE..." "MOTHER IS VERY ILL... I MUST GO TO THE PHARMACY QUICKLY!" "MOTHER... MOTHER! I'VE COME TO YOU... HELP ME!" "MY SON IS OUT THERE!" "YOUR MOTHER IS VERY SICK, LORENZ... WE HAVE TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM ANY EXCITEMENT!" "I'LL GIVE YOU THREE DAY... NOT ONE HOUR MORE!!" "MARIE... I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING..." "MARIE... WHAT WOULD YOU SAY... IF SOMEONE WERE TELL YOU... THAT I'VE BECOME A GOOD FOR NOTHING...?" "I WOULD LAUGH AT HIM, LORENZ!" "BUT IF HE WERE RIGHT, MARIE?" THE LAST ATTEMP "I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU, AUNT..." "AUNT... I BEG YOU... HAVE MERCY... I CAN'T GIVE YOU BACK THE MONEY YET..." "...AND I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE IT WENT!" "THEN THE POLICE WILL HAVE TO CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THIS MATTER." "YOU CAN ASK THE GENTLEMAN WHO DISCOVERED YOUR TALENT TO POST BAIL FOR YOU... OR YOU CAN SIGN OVER YOUR FUTURE ROYALTIES TO ME..." "BUT NONE OF IT IS TRUE! IT'S ALL FABRICATION! ..." "...NO ONE WOULD EVEN GIVE ME "YES!! I LIED TO YOU! BUT I DON'T WANT TO LIE ANY MORE-- NEVER AGAIN!" "YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN BATTER OFF IF YOU HAD KEPT ON LYING, YOU FOOL! ..." "...MAYBY THEN I WOULD HAVE GRANTED YOU A DEFERMENT TO PAY BACK YOUR DEBT! BUT NOW-- TO WHAT END--?!" "I CAN WELL IMAGINE WHAT KIND OF WOMAN YOU THREW MY GOOD MONEY AT..." "...BUT I'LL HAVE THE POLICE AS MUCH ON THAT WOMAN'S THROAT AS THEY ARE ON YOURS!" "WHERE IS LORENZ?" "I DON'T KNOW, MOTHER... BUT HE'LL BE BACK!" "NOW YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!! WHEN THE WHOLE STORY COMES TO LIGHT..." "...YOU'LL GO TO JAIL AND IT WILL BE THE DEATH OF YOUR MOTHER!" "WELL THEN, AGREED... TOMORROW EVENING..." "DO YOU HAVE THE MONEY?!" I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT ANY BUSINESS NOW, I JUST WANT TO HAVE A NICE DINNER WITH YOU." "CHEERS, HERE'S TO A LONG LIFE!" "WHO IS WALKING BACK AND FORTH SO RESTLESSLY?" "DON'T YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP TOO, LORENZ, IT'S ALMOST 2 A.M.!" "WE'RE LOST... WE'RE BOTH LOST... WE'VE GONE TO THE DOGS!" "CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE THE ADDRESSEE LIVES? THE HOUSE NUMBER IS WRONG." "DAMMIT! THE OLD BAG'S NIGHT BELL!" "NO!-- NO!-- DON'T!!" "YOU DON'T NEED TO TIE ME UP... I'LL GO WITH YOU VOLUNTARILY." "DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS, BE GOOD TO MOTHER! FAREWELL!" THE PENANCE... ...AND THE REDEMPTION "WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, LORENZ, TO BRING YOU HOME!" "LOOK, LORENZ-- YOUR NEW HOME!" But I have the consolation that my good Mother died in the firm belief that I was ill. "DID FATHER'S BOOK DO JUSTICE?" "YES, MARIE!--" THE END
