BETTER ARTWORK, BETTER STORYLINES, MORE COMPLEX CHARACTERS. LISTEN, LADY, OK? GOTHAM MAN IS AN ICON. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE JUST LUCKY THAT I'M HERE TO EVALUATE YOUR QUALIFICATIONS AS A DOG OWNER AND NOT YOUR TASTE IN COMICS. [BEEPING] OR YOUR VIDEOGAME SKILLS. THAT WAS LUCK. YOU KNOW IT. SEE YOU LATER. UM, EMILY, UM... THE SPRING DANCE IS NEXT WEEK. I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU WANTED TO GO. I MEAN... WITH ME. YOU HAVE VERY IMPRESSIVE QUALIFICATIONS, CALVIN. I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU, HOWEVER.

IF YOU LOST TYCHO, YOU'D WANT HIM BACK, RIGHT? JUST DO IT, FIGG! NOW. NO. WHAT? [SCOFFS] WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME? "HE'S SELFISH. HE ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF." THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY ABOUT YOU, CALVIN. BUT I NEVER THOUGH THAT THEY WERE RIGHT. TILL NOW. I WANT TO KEEP TYCHO MORE THAN ANYTHING. [WHIMPERING] I KNOW YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING, SON.

CALVIN GAVE TYCHO BACK TO HIS REAL FAMILY AND DIDN'T ACCEPT A REWARD. WAIT A MINUTE. YEAH. YOU CAN SAY A LOT OF BAD THINGS ABOUT CALVIN. THEY'RE PROBABLY TRUE, BUT YOU CAN'T SAY HE DOESN'T LOVE THAT DOG. THIS PHOTO OF TYCHO, I TOOK IT. NO, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THAT WAS TAKEN BY HIS REAL FAMILY. UNH-UNH. LOOK. I TOOK THIS PHOTO WHEN THEY FIRST BROUGH TYCHO INTO THE SHELTER. BUT--BUT THAT MEANS THA THIS FLYER COULDN' HAVE BEEN PUT UP BY TYCHO'S FAMILY. SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. CALVIN! WHAT'S UP, FIGG? LOOK AT THIS. IT WAS PRESTON! YOU KNOW WHAT? HE MADE UP THOSE FLYERS AND POSTED THEM HIMSELF. HE DID IT ALL. HE KNEW HOW MUCH I CARED ABOUT TYCHO, HOW MUCH I WANTED TO DO WHAT WAS BES FOR HIM AND GET HIM BACK TO HIS REAL FAMILY. EXCEPT THEY'RE NO HIS REAL FAMILY. THEY'RE PHONIES! SO WHO ARE THEY?
