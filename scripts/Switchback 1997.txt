Let me get your head in there. Oh. Is somebody at the door? I don't care. Who can it be? Now, you play with your train. I'll be right back, ok? Yeah. Hurry back. All right. Evening, ma'am. Is Frank or Jean home? No, they're not. They'll be back real soon. You must be Missy. Forgive me for not introducing myself, Missy. I'm Tom Bellingham, an old friend of Jean's from Denver. I told her last week I'd stop in and say hello. When did you say they'd be back? Maybe 30 minutes. Darn. I'm gonna miss them. My plane leaves in an hour. Would you tell them that I just dropped by to steal a peek at little Andy? My wife would kill me if I came all the way from Denver and didn't say hello. I'm sorry, Mr. Bellingham. They'll be home real soon. I understand. Don't you worry. Andy? "Jack McGinnis for sheriff. It is time for a change." My God, that boy can smile. Morning, sheriff. Coroner's been on scene about 20, 25 minutes. Is the sheriff there yet? That's a 10-4. The sheriff's here now. All right. I'll release a couple of units then. Coming on the election eve, Amarillo residents will certainly... Morning, boys. Morning, sheriff. Morning, sir. Thanks, Charlie. Hey, sheriff. Hey, Bud. How's your daddy? He's doing better. I'll tell him you asked. Tell him to stay off that leg. Hey. Sheriff. Buck. Sim. You want to tell me about it? Aw, ain't so bad. Male had a severed femoral artery in the groin area. Female had her throat cut. Both wounds, single incisions, almost surgical cuts. Whoever done this knew what they were doing. Nothing tentative about it. I can give you more when we get them out of here. How are you holding up? When have you ever known me to worry about an election? Never. Then again, I've never known anybody who could beat you before. You still don't. Nate. Tell me about it. This fella registered as, uh, Bill Sutherland. Home, Fort Worth. Checked in alone, but paid for 2. The owner said that he paid from a thick wad of bills like to choke a horse. Now, we have no money, have no wallet. Keys, car are gone. We're gonna get an I.D. on the car any minute. What about the girl? She was a maid here at the motel. It's a family place. Here it is... Now, he's in the bathroom. He's finished with Sutherland. She knocks on the door. There's no answer. She comes in. He grabs her, cuts her, stops the blood with the towel, and then carries her into the bathroom. Why? Go figure. What about the other guy? No, no one saw another person. Both beds have been slept in. We found hair samples in this bed matches Sutherland's. Now, this bed's been slept in, but it's clean. Clean? Is that a fact? We will check it again. We're pulling the 4 hours surrounding the time of the murders. Buck, we don't know if he even came in here... or who we're looking for. Soon as you can, Nate, bring in the waitresses. Find out who they know... Regular customers first, then work back from there. Your sister gonna vote for me? Well, she sure likes your billboards. Aw, jeez. McGinnis. Hey, Jack, how you doin'? Looks like a bad one, Buck. Thought I'd come by to see if you needed any help. Well, that's mighty nice of you to offer, Jack. Maybe you and your boys can handle traffic out on the street. A lot of people are gonna be concerned about this one when they hear about it, Buck. If this killer turns up in my jurisdiction, don't expect a courtesy call. If he's in your jurisdiction, Jack, he's safe as a church-mouse. So what about this missing car? red, Texas plates. State Patrol's got the word out on it. Find it. Comin' up on our turnoff. Sure you won't come up, stay the night? Thanks. Uh, I need to get a little further up the road before dark. Well, just don't get stuck out here if this storm hits. Thanks for stopping. There's a girl with a heart There's a girl with a heart As big as the sky Well, get in, boy. I can't heat this car and the whole New Mexico desert, too. All for the love of sunshine All for the love of sunshine Always drive with my doors locked, seat belts on. Habit. I'm a creature of habit. Some collection, eh? Yeah. You should have seen my first one. '82 Seville. Had my girls all lacquered on with liquid sealer. Man, it was a beaut. But after a while, you know, your tastes change, you get tired of looking at the same old faces and all. When I ran out of room to put up new ones, I had to sell her. Man, I had a heck of a time trying to get rid of her. I bet. This honey here, this baby's the state of the art. Now if get tired of one of my sugars, I just slip her out... toss her... and put me up a new one. Don't worry, Trudy, honey. I wasn't going to throw you away... yet. Yeah... hell of a lot cheaper than buying a new car. Yeah. I'm pulling your leg. Ain't my car. It's a friend's. I'm just returning it to him. Had you going, didn't I? Name's Goodall. Bob Goodall. Lane Dixon. Where you heading, Lane? Utah. Big place, Utah. Salt Lake City. Me, too. Now, how's that for luck? First I save you from freezing to death, now you got a free ride to Mormon land. Must be my lucky day. Must be. I almost didn't stop. In the old days, I'd never think twice about picking up a rider. These days, you can't be too careful who you let in your car. You know, if you'd just let me out at this place we're coming up on, that'd be great. I don't think so. There's another place about 20 miles up the road. Look, I said I want out here. Sorry, friend. This is mining country. I can take care of myself. I believe you just might be fool enough to try. Thanks for the lift. Hell, lettin' a bunch of naked women scare you off. Heh heh. How you doin'? I'll have a beer. Don't have beer. Ok, uh... I'll have whatever's in one of those bottles. I was hoping I might catch a ride over to Raton. Well... you might be waiting here a long time, then. Well, I'll take a ride anywhere in that direction. I bet you would. You got a problem with something? You say this is the guy, Ben? He's one of them, all right. My friend Ben here was in Raton last Friday night. Claims you and some of your friends jumped him. Well, he's mistaken. And you're a goddamn liar. Uh-uh. They aren't going in your direction. Course right now, I figure you'd probably take a lift in any direction. Look, I'm not calling your friend or anyone else a liar. All I'm saying is I wouldn't have done that to anybody. On your feet, boy! You made a bad mistake comin' in here. Now, seein' that Ben can't do this to you himself, I'm going to teach you a lesson. Hey, Rick. Do it again. Come on! Your memory becoming clearer? I never saw him before. No? Son of a bitch! Get his goddamn legs. Want another piece of him? No, I got to take a leak. Luke! You keep him warmed up till I get back, huh? Huh? Uhh! Hey, Luke! I said don't kill the bastard! I'll be right back! Ha ha ha ha. Hoo hoo ha ha ha. Try it, and it's history. Luke! He's got a knife on me! Bring the guy in here, alone, man. Let him go. I'll blow your friend's head off. Some friends you got. I didn't come to negotiate, Bud. Aah! Don't bargain with him, you asshole! He'll cut my dick off! Now slide the piece over here. And let him go. You ok? Yeah. Pick up the gun and get the keys out of my pocket. Pull the car out front, and when you're ready, honk. What about you? I'll be out directly. Hey... hey, man, he... he let the guy go. W-W-Why don't you do likewise, huh? I mean, that... that was the deal. Deal? Who said anything about a deal? What? Wha... W-What are you going to do? Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, please. Aah! Oh! Oh, thank God. Oh, thank you. Still itching for a fight, Bud? Come on and get some of this. It's ok, Bob! Yee-haw! Ha ha ha! Goddamn! Nothin' like a little excitement to get the old blood a-pumpin'! Hey, what you looking for? Looking for them. Someone following us? Not yet. Yeah, that's because it takes time to change a flat tire. Did you slash their tires? Yeah... Hell, no. I'd have been there all night. How you feelin'? Must've got worked over pretty good. I'll live. Thanks. Yeah, feeling's mutual, partner. Hey... I heard you were in early. Forensics did find a hair in that second bed. They're pushing it through. And we isolated 20 unknowns in the videotapes. I ran into Billy Coogan last night. He said we're leading McGinnis Did you end up calling in the Fed boys on those motel killings? No. Why? 'Cause it looks like we've got company. You ever see anything like that before? Yes. I'll see ya, Buck. Good luck out there today. Have a good day, Jim. Make sure you stop by the polls. Sheriff Olmstead. Sally. It's coming, sheriff. Care for some breakfast, Mr. Lacrosse? Oh, no, thank you. So... what can we do for the FBI today? You have 2 bodies in the morgue. I need the car that was taken from the motel. Take a number. Time is critical, sheriff. Time is always critical, Mr. Lacrosse. What makes you so sure that we're talkin' about the same killer here? Excuse me. Severed femoral artery, single incisions, inch, inch and a half deep. You've seen the bodies. No prints, no weapon, no witnesses. I know this killer, sheriff, and when he kills, he moves fast, and the only chance you have of catching him is to find out what he's driving or to be incredibly lucky. Do you mind if I call you by your first name, Frank? Now, you say you know this killer. You got a physical description? Height? Weight? Hair color? Male between the ages of 20 to 50, medium to large build, from a western state. Probably spent a lot of time in the east. Well, that really narrows the field down, doesn't it, Frank? He's a serial killer, sheriff. Well, the serial killers we've dealt with didn't seem to want to have their victims found. This one does. Sally, bring me a cup to go, please. Right up, Buck. Well, who knows, Frank? Maybe we'll both get lucky today. Hey, Oscar. Hey, Buck. Well, the city police spotted the car about 4 a.m. The officers tailed it here, and then instead of waiting for backup, one of the cops followed him inside... Course, that's when the suspect started shooting. Just beautiful. Yeah, well, he's holed up in back someplace. Of course, McGinnis has got his whole swat team here now, and he won't let any of our deputies near the place. Course not. Hell, the TV trucks might show up any minute. Speak of the devil. Could I have your flashlight, please? Damn. All dressed up. Well, Buck, come to see how a real operation is done? I declare, Jack, you must have calluses from patting yourself on the back so much. Why don't you just give me the facts here? Hold this, please. Yes, sir. Oh, my God. What the hell's going on over there? Bill! Christ. Allen's down. We can't reach him. We're falling back. Bill. Bill! Allen's hit. He's in the room. I need instructions. Over. Get him out of there, Jack. Is he alone? Who the hell's this? Jack, this is Frank Lacrosse, FBI. Ask him. Listen, mister, I got a man down... Ask him! Bill, is he alone? Can't tell. He says he's holding a knife on one of them. Bill, where are you in relation to the room? We're down the hall, northwest stairwell. Hey! Hey! Bill, you're about to have some company. Stop him! I got a family in here! Give me a 2-way in here right now! I want a radio! Only one down? Yeah. Sir, Chief McGinnis said that... Shit. He's going into the room. Shut that door! If he gets one of my men killed... Well, that'd make you look real bad, wouldn't it, Jack? All this TV coverage, you in charge. What's going on out there? I swear to God, I'll start cutting in here! Who the fuck are you? I said I negotiate only by radio. Answer me! Are you blind, man? I got a knife! I see it. Uh-uh. They don't go anywhere, or I cut him. They don't have a choice. Man, I don't know who you are, but I'm gonna make you pay. Before you do... I just want to ask you one question. Question? You're crazy. Where'd you get the car? I ain't answerin' any of your fuck... aah! Who fired that shot? It came from inside the apartment. Now... where did you get the car? Car... The car... from the motel. Get in there. Now. I don't know nothin' about a motel. I boosted it a couple hours ago. Where? Where?! Sutherland's. Where'd this come from? In the car. Along with a body. Well, thanks a lot, Frank. public service, and you just wiped the slate clean with one quick, easy stroke. What are you talking about? Oh, hell. Never mind. I'm glad you caught the killer. He's not the killer. Good morning. Ha ha ha. God... damn! Your 7 a.m. wake-up call. You know, you could have just given me a shake. I wake easily. My God. Hungry? Hector Saldez... armed robbery, conviction of second-degree murder in Oklahoma, and now caught in possession of a murder victim's wallet and car. All you've got on him is possession of a stolen vehicle. He didn't know about the wallet till I showed it to him. I bet he didn't even know there was a body in the car. Says you. Ballistics have already matched the gun he used on my men as the one used to cap that John Doe in the car. Any more theories? Jack, I think all Frank's trying to say here is we need to keep our options open. There's no "we" in this, Buck. I have the suspect in custody, and as soon as I get the green light from the D.A., I'm going to announce that Saldez is being charged with the murders of those 3 people. Don't do that. He's setting you up. You make that announcement, he'll kill again just to embarrass you. Embarrass me? I suppose you've had that happen to you before, Mr. Lacrosse? Yes. Oh, I get it. Well, you would like me to delay that announcement till after the election, wouldn't you, Buck? That was a nice try. Who the hell is this guy anyway? I mean, how many times you seen an FBI agent work a case alone? We can find out. Don't have much use for us state and local boys, do you, Frank? It's a prejudice I have, sheriff. No one's proved me wrong yet. Well, I have my problems with Jack myself, but, you know, there for a brief moment, I found myself thinking he was making a lot more sense than you. I don't care what you think, sheriff. Maybe not, but you need me, or you'd be long gone by now. Why believe me and not him? First of all, I've seen a hell of a lot more murders than he has, and these just don't seem to fit that man he's got in lockup. Secondly... maybe you haven't noticed, but Chief McGinnis and I are engaged in an election battle for my office which he desperately wants, and which l... I'm sad to say... am desperate to defend. Him? Well, I'll take that as a compliment. But the fact remains he has a suspect in custody and I don't. But I'm here to tell you, Frank, I'm not going to be worth a damn to you in this investigation unless I know what you know about this killer. Ok. When I turned around and saw that 30.30 staring down at me, I thought, wow, this is it. No joining the birds this time. Joining the what? Old railroaders used to say that if you were on a train that was about to crash and you had a chance to jump, you were joining the birds. You worked on the railroad. For a while. Mined a while, cowboy'd a while. Fact, I did a little bit of everything up here. Hey, Fae, is this ticket right? How we gonna get through with the storm? Ain't gonna affect us much. It's going north. What about you, Lane Dixon? What kind of work you do? I'm between jobs right now. Before that. Before that, uh... I worked in a hospital. Orderly? Nurse? Well, I did a little bit of everything. That's what's in Utah, a job? No. I've just been, uh... traveling. It's my first time west. Come over from Alamosa? Yep. - How is it up there? It's not bad. Worst of it's going north. Well, we've been watching it come down here for the last hour or so. How'd you know? My father used to say, "Weather don't make the rules. Mountains do." And I know the mountains. How y'all doing? We're doing just fine here. How about you, darlin'? Get you anything? I'm ok, thanks. Your friend's cute, but shy. I'm gonna get a paper. Now, did I scare him off? Tell him I won't bite if he looks me in the eye. You all right? He's chokin'. He ain't breathing. Call an ambulance. God damn it, Fae, call the ambulance! Is he gonna die? Let me look at him. I'm a doctor. Get back. Let him look at him. He's got something really jammed in there. God, he's turning blue. Get in the kitchen, Fae. God damn it, go on! Get him on the counter. I'm going to need a first-aid kit. I need some alcohol. And give me that right there. Open up his shirt. Ok, open the bottle. Now pour. Oh, my God. God damn it, Fae, get in... God damn! Dr. Dixon. Don't call me that. Hey, I didn't make that up. You called yourself one. It clears a path. Don't give me that bullshit. What you did in there wasn't something you picked up out of some book. You've had training. Now, maybe you've been in medical school and dropped out, or maybe you been in the army, but you don't lie to me that you're no doctor because I was just in the operating room with you. I don't want to talk about it. Dr. Dixon. He kills for the sensation of power. He started with the unconnected victim. No one missed them when they were alive, and it was a long time before anyone realized that they were gone. He is credited with at least 18 known deaths. No way of knowing how many came before he began telling me about them. He tells you about them. What's he do, call you? He writes. He sends me these. Why you, Frank? I headed a task force that tracked him for 15 months. After the task force formed, he changed. He got bolder. He started taking more risks. He began to see the murders as a kind of competition. He turned it into a damn game on you. Yes. And he took his publicity very seriously. But it got harder for him. He started making mistakes. We got closer. Then 3 months ago... he just stopped. Why? I don't know. He's been quiet ever since. I need to make a call. Go ahead on in and use the phone in my office, Frank. There ain't no doubt about it. He knows this killer. What are you thinking, Nate? I'm thinkin' it's 8 a.m., polls are open, and I hope to God we're hunting the right man. It's me. Amarillo. Since about 4:00 this morning. No, I was too late again. They did? When? What did you tell them? Don't cry, honey. No, I don't think that they know I'm here yet. We'll deal with that when it comes. I love you. You're a strange one, Doc. You're smart, cool under pressure. Yet something's bothering you. Fine. You don't want to talk about it, that's your business. I quit. I was a first-year intern. I was good. Hell, I was cocky I thought I was so good. When it started to get heavy, I used to watch other post-graduates wash out, and I'd think, "That'll never happen to me." Well... here I am. What happened? You have a patient die on you or something? Yeah. Hell, that's gonna happen. But you go home, get some sleep, get up the next day and try again. Yeah, I did. It just, uh... I couldn't shake it, you know? Well, you seemed cured today. This time. But what about the next time? What do you want, guarantees? There ain't no guarantees. What a waste. Yeah. I've heard that before. Yeah, bet you have. And like anyone else in your life, I got nothing invested in you. My father used to say, "Nerve succeeds." You've got the nerve, Doc, and I've seen it up close. If you really were a quitter, you would have stood around like the rest of us. As of 7:30 this morning, we have 6 reported missing persons... and 5 homeless who didn't report to shelters last night. Rule out the homeless. He needed transportation. Sheriff? Mr. Saldez's attorney, Mr. Martinez, is here, and he is breathing fire about Mr. Lacrosse shooting his client. Thank you, Becky. We really do need for this guy to cooperate with us, Frank. Mmm. Maybe Nate and I ought to talk to him alone. No. I'll talk to him. Ok. Mr. Lacrosse? The lab reports just came back about that hair they found in the bed. It is definitely not Saldez's. A 36052. I beg your pardon? Special agent Frank Lacrosse, am I glad to see you. Mr. Martinez, thank you for coming in. I wouldn't miss it. I wanted to thank you personally for making my job of defending Hector Saldez such an easy one. Really? How's that? How's violating three of his constitutional rights for starters? Torturing him? Illegally questioning him? Failure to advise him of his rights? Oh, Mr. Lacrosse, you're a godsend. Jorge... may I remind you that your client was holding a knife on an innocent man? You can remind me all you want to, sheriff. It ain't going to mean jack to the jury. So I take it you don't wish to cooperate with us? What, are you kidding? I came here to thank you personally on behalf of my client who I will also be representing in civil proceedings against you and the city. Good day, gentlemen. Sit down, Mr. Martinez. You didn't hear what I said? I'm not staying. Oh, yes, you are. What are you going to do, special agent? Are you going to put a bullet in me, too? Uh, excuse me, sir. The lab report just got back. It was a 36052. Thank you, Bud. Bud, what the hell are you talking about? I'm sorry, Mr. Martinez. I've wasted your time. Um, what do you mean by that 360... Oh, that's a lab term. It's about a hair we found in the motel. We'll see you in court. - Lab term? - Yeah. 'Cause, look, you wanted to know about the car, right? Oh, that's no longer necessary. 'Cause l... I could tell you if we made a deal. Jorge... Deal... What kind of deal are we talking about here? Drop the murder charges, and I'll tell you where he found the Explorer. Forget it. You know you can't prove anything. We'll see. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, amigo. He boosted the car at the airport. Long-term parking, lot "C." Get that list of stolen cars. Thank you, Mr. Martinez. What about the hair? Oh, yeah. It belonged to a male in his early 20s. Brown. Son of a bitch. Go back to the waitresses at the restaurant. See if that hair color sparks anything. You got it, Mr. Lacrosse. They teach you that little 36052 maneuver back at the academy, did they, Frank? No. My wife did. And what is she, a con woman? Sort of. She's a lawyer. Airport security does have videotape on all the license plates coming and going from long-term parking. We're going to pull the last 24 hours and cross-check that with stolen vehicles. Well, Frank, it looks like you may have just gotten your first big break. I think we ought to make an announcement, Buck. Announcement? We don't know anything yet. We know it's not Saldez. We can blow McGinnis' case clear out of the water. No. You do that, you'd be letting the real killer know that we're onto him. I think we'd be making a big mistake, Buck. Most of the folks in town here are going to be voting on their lunch hour. We still got time. Is that what's going on here, winning an election? Winning that election is my goddamn livelihood. Now, I know you don't give a tinker's damn about that, but I've been working hard in this office for 15 years, and if Jack McGinnis wins, Buck Olmstead ain't the only one who's gonna lose out around here. The only reason McGinnis has not made that announcement is because he doesn't have enough to charge Saldez. And until that time comes, we just stand pat. Sheriff, telephone. Sheriff Olmstead. How can I help you? Sheriff, Grant Montgomery, FBI here in Dallas. I understand Frank Lacrosse is in your custody. Well, he's here. He's not in my custody. Well, I'll be arriving in a couple of hours to take him off your hands. Mr. Montgomery, he's working on a case here. Shouldn't be. Should be in Philadelphia on another assignment, which he left 24 hours ago without authorization. And this isn't the first time, sheriff. He's left duty posts 3 times in the last 2 months. He's currently on bureau probation. You want to tell me what he did wrong? Not your problem, sheriff, but I'd appreciate it if you'd hold him till we get there. What about your ongoing investigation with this killer? Is that what he told you? There is no ongoing FBI investigation, sheriff. The case has been closed for nearly 3 months. That's impossible. Look, sheriff... No. You look! Now, I got 3 people dead in this town, and you tell me you're coming to pick up the only man that seems to know what the hell is going on? Now, I want some answers. I don't give a shit what you want. Right now, the only thing that you'd better deal with is keeping that man in your sight till I get there. Now, if that's too much to ask I can have a U.S. Marshal in your office in 5 minutes who can handle that kind of responsibility. Are we clear, sheriff? Buck, what's going on? I don't know. What's wrong with it? It's not tuned for this elevation. Did you fix it? Naw. Just patched it till we get to the next town. And where is that? Not far. Find everything ok, Frank? Yeah. Thanks. Is this your wife on the horse? Yep. Beautiful woman. Thanks, Frank. We had 33 wonderful years together. She passed on... I'm sorry. How about you, Frank? Where'd you meet your wife at? In law school. So you're a lawyer, too. I never took the bar. I did an internship one summer with the bureau and never looked back. Any children? One. And what does your wife think about you traipsing all over the countryside chasing banditos? Oh, actually, she's very understanding. That's key. Sit down and eat. Plenty more where that came from. No, thank you. Nonsense. I make the very best BLTs in this part of the country. The secret's in the tomato. Built a greenhouse out back... He took my son. You asked me why he stopped killing. We were getting close. We had several breaks. Outside of Boston, we had roadblocks set up within 20 minutes of a murder there, and he slipped through them. Everybody felt it was just a matter of time before we nailed that guy. And then he took my son. And by doing that, he... He removed you from the case. The bureau gave the kidnapping the highest priority. at a motel in Wisconsin. His prints matched those found on my door, and with his body, we found detailed notes about the victims. Dates, places, things only the killer would know. Obviously, you don't think the guy's dead. It was too easy. I tracked this man for 18 months. I know him. He used that guy to end the chase. Among the notes... they found this. That's my little boy. "Believe." Believe in what? I don't know. Day after tomorrow. I assume your people have checked all this out? Yeah. They found nothing. What about your son, Frank? Do you really think he's still alive? I don't have a choice. Texas plate, 234-4S3. "James Ruskin." Ruskin. James... That's a hit. James Ruskin, missing out of Midland 2 days ago. What's he driving? '77 Cadillac Eldorado, white. We got it. Put the word out. That fellow and me, we went to school together, went to work together, he was the best man at my wedding. I broke my back 2 years ago. You want to guess who fed my kids while I was laid up? Come on, Shorty. Make me sound like a saint. That's broken, Bob. Could you hand me one of those spark plugs? There you go. Thanks. What kind of work did you guys do? We cleared passes for the Rio Grande. You know, a storm like this can drop 11/2 to 2 feet in these passes. Somebody's got to clear 'em up so the freight can get through. That was our job. And when did you start doing this? Well, I was in the service for a while, I got married, had a family. I guess I figured I'd better not tempt fate. You're listening to the Country King. And now the news. Amarillo City police have confirmed... Hey, Bob, turn that up, will you? Suspect in custody in connection with the shooting in a local apartment complex early this morning. Sources close to the investigation say the suspect may have some connection with the 2 brutal murders at a local motel and a third body discovered at the apartment complex. You fellas been following those murders down in Amarillo? It's a bad business. The last 2 days, I've been carrying this. You be careful with that. Can't be too careful is what I say. You goin' somewhere? Stretch my legs. How long before we're outta here, Shorty? Oh, about 10 minutes, but you ain't goin' anywhere. You're staying with us tonight. Next time. Sweet tooth. What? Bob wouldn't tell you, but he's got a vicious sweet tooth. Pretty when it comes down like that. Yeah. And if it gets any prettier, I'll be spending the night here. I just want to pick up some candy. Sure. Pretty quiet. Quiet isn't the word. I broke my tail to get into work today, nearly ran off the road twice, and for what? You're the first person I've seen today. What about your boss? Oh, well, he calls and tells me he can't make it in. I told him, even Braddock's across the street is closed, but does he tell me to lock up and go home before I get stuck? Course not. What can I get for you? Candy corn. Small bag. Ok. Why don't you just lock the store up and not tell him? Oh... ha!...I would, but he's going to call and check on me. Otherwise, believe me, I'd be out of here. Hey, listen, I didn't mean to bend your ear with this. It's 2.75. Oh, that's him. Better tell Bob. Hey, Shorty. Hey, John. How about some gas? Comin' right up. Finished for the day? Just starting. Whew! '77 Eldorado. Yours? No. It's a friend of mine's. She's a beaut. Wait till you see the interior. Whoa, baby! Whoo. Yeah, that's right, Larry. Not a soul the entire morning. Yeah, well, I wish you were paying me what you're spending to heat the place. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. See you tomorrow. You didn't take my money. Oh, forget it. If I rang it up, he'd see it tomorrow and give me hell. Well, at least let me buy you a cup of coffee. Thanks... but I'd better hit the road while I got the chance. Hey, I hate to ask, but I might need a hand getting my car out. If you would't mind helping me, and then... Maybe. Maybe? You wouldn't be leading me on, would you? Bob? Shorty's finished with the car. Thanks for coming in and telling me. Sorry I can't help you. Maybe next time. The wind must have turned it around. Sorry if I interrupted something back there. You flatter me, Doc. Something wrong? Naw. Nice hat, Doc. Wish you fellas would change your mind. Next time, Shorty. Hang on, Doc. I forgot something. I'll be right back. Shorty? Yo! Back here, Bob. Forget something? Yeah. If you're gonna try to force money on me, you should know better 'cause I ain't accepting it. What's the matter, Buddy? When did he spot it? at a gas station in Martinsberg. The officer did not know the car was hot. He's going back right now to investigate. Do we have a description of the driver? Yes. White male, early 20s, brown hair. Matches one of our unknowns from the motel. And another thing, Buck... they're here for him. Ok. Light's changed. Yeah. I see it. They're here. Thank God. Wait a minute, Frank. Close the door. Oh, my God, they're leavin'. What's the story, deputy? You said he'd be here Well, you know, Buck's been having some car trouble. He's got a bad solenoid on that starter. I'll call him. I'll call him right now. Buck, what the hell are you doing? Don't ask any questions if you don't want to hear the answer. Buck, are you out of your mind? You're messing with a federal investigation here. That's called obstruction of justice. I know exactly what it's called. Get on the phone to the airport. Tell them to have the chopper standing by in 10 minutes. A department helicopter? And I want a car waiting for him in Martinsberg. Buck, McGinnis is going to have a field day with this. Even if you do win, he'll have you impeached. Well, I guess we can just consider this my last official act. Colorado State Patrol says they've got roadblocks set up in a 200-mile radius. Lot of snow up there right now. Slow going. Maybe you'll get lucky. Thanks. Buck? Go find him, Frank. Time's a wastin'. Damn. It's cold. I know. Heater ain't working. Radio, too. Shorty must have blown a fuse when he was working. Where are we? My shortcut. We'll skirt the storm this way. Cut 2 hours off our time. If we get there. Trust me, Doc. Trust me. Doc, while you were sleepin', I was thinkin'... and I've decided I have to ask a great favor of you. I have a son. I'm not the best old man he could have had, but I do my best. I have someone to keep him for me. Where's his mother? She's dead. My sister keeps him. Why are you telling me this? I've been thinking about if something happened to me, he's got no one to look up to. Nothing's gonna happen to you. I don't need you to take care of him. He needs somebody to sort of be a godfather to him. Be an example. What, me? You're smart, Doc. Tough. Responsible. Hard qualities to find these days. If something did happen to me, I'd appreciate it if you'd do that for me. Sure. Thank you. He lives in Oakland. Down near the bay. You remember that address? Uh, 8899 Todd. Yeah. Thanks, Doc. I feel better already. Ahh... yeah. Just in time, huh? Ha ha ha! Whoa! Hold on, Doc! God damn it, get out! Bob? Bob! Hey, Bob! Yeah! I'm here! Don't come down here, Doc! It's too dangerous! My God. Can you get out? No! It's jammed! Then I'm coming down! Stay up there! One wrong move, and they'll be digging both our asses out in July. Hang on! Oh. God damn, you deaf son of a bitch, I said stay up there! It's a little too late for that. If we get out of this thing, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you for sure. This ain't so bad. Oh, no, Mr. Ice-Water-ln-The-Veins? But now, since you're down here, you might as well get me out of this. Uh, here... Here, I got a better idea. Be careful not to cut my pearls. Real easy. Don't want you cutting the wrong thing. God, I'm sure gonna miss you girls. Thank you, baby. I'll see you later. Let's get the hell out of here! I gotcha. Ahh. Whoo! Thanks, Doc. I'm gonna still beat the shit out of you. Come on, let's git. I hope you know where we are. I sure do, partner. I sure do. Just a little stroll, then a nice, warm bed. Mmm! I can smell that coffee brewing right now. Yeah, and some grits, bacon, and some biscuits and honey. Yeah. I'm telling you, you're gonna like this place, Doc. What the hell? Ah. What the hell you think you got, Huh? Whew. Get on up here! You think that's funny, huh? Doc! Bob! Bob! I got you, Doc. Don't even think about trying to pull some local strings here, sheriff. I consider what you did to be a serious obstruction of justice, and I'm gonna make sure you remember this stay. Damn, Grant, you've got me quakin' in my boots. Mr. Lacrosse? Yes. Captain Heber, Colorado State Patrol. I'm supposed to hold you till your people get up here tomorrow. Mind if I have a look around, captain? Be my guest. Victim's name was Clyde "Shorty" Callahan. No murder weapon was found. Never even tried to pull it. We figure it was a blitz attack. How else can you do that to a man with a loaded.38? Maybe he trusted him. We still got roadblocks up on routes 10, 160, and out on 350. If he wanted to get out of this valley, he'd have to pass through one of them. I guarantee no Cadillac has. What about the roads through the mountains, have they been checked? Don't need to. I can tell you right now they're completely impassable. Nothing going in or out. You don't think he made it past the roadblocks. He's not in the mountains. Where is he? I didn't say he didn't get through the roadblocks. I said no Cadillac like that has. I got a report that says there's over 200 stranded vehicles on l-25 alone. And that's just between here and Pueblo. If he were heading to Alamosa, the weather's worse. I think when we start digging all those vehicles out, we're gonna find us one white Cadillac. Kinda got ahead of himself, didn't he? Not even the 17th. I asked Ruth to hold a room for you over at the railroad maintenance dorm over by the tracks. It's the only place in town. I thought you were supposed to hold me. Well, it's 20 miles to the nearest lockup, and I figure if the killer can't get out, you can't either. Thanks, captain. Don't thank me. Thank Buck Olmstead. Damn shame about that election. Won't be the same without him. Howdy. Good evening. You Mr. Lacrosse? Yes. Sign in here, please. Terrible thing, that murder. You know, I used to baby-sit for Shorty when he was just a little fella. I can't believe it. Good night, Ruth. See ya, Bill. You be careful up there now. You betcha. Shorty used to do that. What's that? Clear the passes. His wife made him give it up on account it was too dangerous. That's irony, isn't it? He gave up clearing the passes 'cause it was too dangerous. Then he gets hisself killed in his own garage. Well, here's your key. The room is out the door to the right. Here you go, Bob. Nice. Yeah. Where is everyone, Al? I thought this place would be packed. Well, you can't get in, and nobody's getting out, so it ain't packed. How'd you all get in to La Veta, anyway? Ah, we hoofed it. Little car trouble up on the mountain. You guys are really lucky. Yeah. Don't look like he held up to well. He did better than you think. Wonderful, Robby. Tell Sally it was delicious. Will do, sheriff. I brought that little something you asked for. Oh, thank you. I'll get you a glass. Make it 2, will ya, Robby? Well, I see you've adjusted well to your new situation. Care to join the recently unemployed in a drink? Don't be so down, Nate. It's not your fault. I just can't help thinking that... maybe we should have made that announcement. Maybe. Or maybe if he'd killed in Midland instead of Amarillo... or... if Saldez would have had his little shoot-'em-up in our jurisdiction instead of McGinnis'... Who knows? Maybe we should have turned him in. Maybe we should've done a lot of things differently. But turning Frank in was never an option. Why not? 'Cause he told the truth. Once you've heard the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey. I might have settled for it. No, you wouldn't. You're a good policeman, Nate. You're gonna do just fine with Jack. Now you go on home and hug those children. Give that pretty wife of yours a kiss and know that what you've done was the right thing. What about you, Buck? Me? Well, as you can see, this whole experience has just devastated me. Good night, sheriff. Bob, good to see ya. You, too, Hank. Hey, Bob. Hey, Tate. What's news, Cubby? Someone got killed over in Martinsberg. They think it might be the same guy from Amarillo? If they do, they ain't saying? State Patrol say they're looking for a young fella. You boys seem to be up on all the news. Well, hell, we been stuck here since the day before yesterday. Haven't done anything but watch TV. Well, then... it's time we get that pass opened up and move on. Well, they're gonna send a crew up tonight. You're more than welcome to go with them. Be like old times. In my youth, friend. In my youth. Thank you, Hank. Now, what's your rush? Uh, you see, the lack of female clientele disturbs me. Uh, by the way, Tate, you hear anything about the 218? Martinsberg? Last I heard, it's going up. But it don't come here. You know that. Just asking. Well, they got the pass open. Don't worry. The 218's the only train till tomorrow. Pass is clear, boys. Got the word the pass is clear. All right. Thank you. You ready to go? You're full of shit, Joe, you know that, right? I know what I'm talking about. A Cadillac. I know what a Cadillac is. Filled with pictures of naked women, right? That's what I said. Uh-huh. I heard it on the radio. What about that car? You heard it, too? Tell this guy it's the truth, will ya? It's the car that the killer in Amarillo was driving, wasn't it? See? He knows. Hey, stranger. How about this for a day? They sent a plow to the pass last night and had some luck. We got about 30 minutes before the train leaves. You feeling all right, Doc? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, uh... just a little tired here. Sleep ok? Yeah. Thought maybe you heard the police were looking for a car like mine. White Cadillac. Yeah, I did. Well, that car that they're looking for had Texas plates. Mine had Oklahoma tags, remember? Uh, yeah. That's right. You do believe me, don't you? Yeah. It's just, uh, it's crazy. It just took me by surprise. You? How about me? Well, I'm going downstairs to catch the weather. Throw on your clothes, and we'll grab a bite before we go. Ok. Frigid temperatures continue to blow in from the northwest, and it looks like we won't even reach the 32-degree mark until sometime this weekend. At Cherry Creek Dodge, we've been steering you right with great deals for 16 years. Now we've put special anniversary sale prices on every car, truck, and van... Hey, Doc. Ready? Where did you get that car? Look, Doc, I can understand your concerns, but you ever stop to think about how many white Caddies there probably are in the great state of Texas? Probably a lot. I'd say more than that. But not that many with pictures. Where'd you get the car? Well, I lied to you. I wasn't taking it to no one. It's my car. Bought it in Tulsa the day before I picked you up, but that doesn't mean I killed anyone. Stop right there. I told you it was a friend's because I figured you'd feel too uncomfortable if you thought it was mine. And I was right, wasn't I? Wasn't I? I was gonna throw all those pictures out when I got to Salt Lake. They were a hoot, though, weren't they? Those pictures? Doc... if I killed those people... why would I travel in that car? Don't come any closer. If I was the killer, would I take you to all the places where I'm known, introduce you to my friends, hell, even save your neck? I mean it! If I was the killer, why didn't I kill you? I had plenty of chances. God damn it! It was my car! Prove it! With what?! I got off a train and bought it off a fella for 500 bucks! I knew it wasn't on the up and up because of the price. What did you expect me to do, ask him for a receipt? That is the truth! And if you can't trust me, then turn me in, 'cause all I got is my word. In Amarillo today, police officials have announced that the key suspect has been booked for the murders of 3 people there Friday. Amarillo City Police Chief Jack McGinnis praised investigators for the arrest of Hector Saldez. I want to thank the combined efforts of the city police and forensic departments for the arrest of this killer. The suspect's name is Hector Saldez. Mr. Saldez has been wanted in New Mexico and Oklahoma on assault charges. Now, both of these states have waived extradition so that we may proceed with the prosecution. Chief, do these murders have anything to do with the murder in Colorado yesterday? Well, I can't comment on their investigation. Chief McGinnis would not comment on whether there was any connection between the slayings in Texas and a recent murder in... Just an accident, Al. Nothing to get all excited about. Ah. Let me know what we owe you for damages. What? Colorado State Patrol found his car in a stream near a railroad trestle. Seems he lost control while chasing a train. They're looking for his body now. A train? Yeah, a Rio Grande freight. The 218. It wasn't a date. He set him up. We've gotta get in touch with that train. Can't. They're out of contact till it gets to the other side. Storm's knocked out telephone transmission. How long? He knew Frank wouldn't give up, so he sucked him in. Are you saying that the killer was expecting him to be there? And I helped deliver him. Who are you? Ray Calabrese. Don't shoot me. Please. How'd you lose your shoe? Getting on the train. How'd you get here? I was with that crew that cleared La Veta pass last night. Everyone else went back down to Martinsberg with the plow. I live in Salida, on the other side of the pass. takes me home. When's the next one due over? This is it for the day. No, that's not possible. There's gotta be another one. Not unless you wanted to climb the hill to the upper grade at Understanding, catch the 20-10. There are 2 lines through the pass. The upper grade is on the other side of the hill. What's Understanding, a town? No, man. It's a railroad siding. When's it come through? The 20-10? In about an hour. You can't go up there like that. Watch me. Wait. What do I owe you? Bill's already been settled. Bob paid it. You know where I can find him? Over at the freight office. Sorry. Right then. I'm on my way. Bye. Can I talk to you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I doubted you. Doc, if I had been in your shoes, hearing what you heard, I'd have probably held a gun on me, too. If the offer's still open, uh, I'm going over with you. Glad to have you, partner. Bobby! - Hey! - Hey! How you doing, Buddy? Oh, God. Hey, Doc! This crusty old thing here... Oh, welcome! Welcome! ...is Tex Monroe. Climb aboard. I'll tell ya, any friend of this man is a friend of mine. Come on. I got a lot to tell ya about Bobby. Come on in here. Now, if you won't help him, let me out of here, and I will. You've helped the FBI enough already, don't you think? My God, man. He's trying to find his son. It's a pipe dream, sheriff. Jack. I need your help here, Jack. I wish I could help you, Buck, but... It's a federal thing. By the time it would take me to get a hearing... I don't need a hearing. I need you to turn the key. Christ, Buck. This is the last thing I need on the first day. Yes, it is. Open the door. You're off to a good start, Jack. Anything else you need? Well, as a matter of fact... there is. Yep, we're getting up close to the pass. Trains still get swept away in slides up here. Careful what you touch up there, Doc. Yes siree. Those levers control them big 4-ton wings out there. You send one out by accident... Have just a little bit of trouble getting through the next tunnel. What gives them power? Them big air tanks in the main compartment. This always been your job, working this thing? Aw, no, no. I just a-haulin' this spreader over to Alamosa. Clearing passes ain't a job I cotton to. Night work, mostly. Cold. Oh, God. Bobby, he used to clear these passes up here, though. Long time ago, Tex. Long time ago. Oh. Aah! Aah! Anybody got a light? Well, I'll be damned. This is the place... where them murders were in Amarillo. The motel in Amarillo. Been on the news for 2 days. Did I say something? Yeah, Tex, you did. Hope I didn't say nothin' bad. Nothing bad, Tex. It's just ol' Doc over there has got me pegged as a killer right about now. What? Where'd you get a crazy thought like that? Why, they're looking for some young fella with brown hair... sorta like yours. Jeez. This here man... is the salt of the Earth. The salt of the Earth. Stay right there, Doc. Oh, my God. Let me help him. It's too late. There's nothing you can do. Aah! Bring that pack down here. I'll take the gun. Relax, Doc. You followed me from the motel. Actually, from the night before. I watched you check in. The motel was full, so you shared a room with that fella. I didn't stay. I was car shopping that night. But by the time you came over for breakfast the next morning, I was back. I heard you ask for a ride. Then I paid your friend Mr. Sutherland a visit. It was a quick visit. They'll find you. I don't think so. Like Tex said, they ain't lookin' for me. Where's the gun? Oh. Freeze. I didn't do it. Get away from him. Look, it was him. He's the one who did it. He's the one who killed him. I didn't do it. Where is he?! What? Who? I will kill you to find him. I don't know what you're talking about. Look out! Aah. You made good time, Frank. I have to admit, I was worried for awhile that you'd make it at all. Drop the gun so we can talk civilized. State Patrol knows I'm on this train. They know you're on it. They'll be waiting on the other side. Always needing help, aren't you, Frank? You didn't start out that way. In the beginning, when it was just me and you, it was a challenge. I'd make a move, then you'd make a move. Then you have to start playing the game unfairly. It never was a game. Oh, yes, it was. Me against you. Then it was me against you and 50 other agents. Then 200 agents. You never seemed to have any trouble. Hey, don't bullshit me, Frank. So I had to level the playing field. That's why I took your boy. Where is he? Remember the deal? Kill me to find him. You had your chance, Frank! You should have taken it! Bye, Frank! Don't talk. Rest. Aah! Aah! Southern Pacific, this is Denver dispatch. You read me? Yeah. You got the nerve, Doc. It's time to give it up. Aah! Aah! Where's my son? Kill me to find him, Frank. That was the deal. Yee-haw! Aah. Oh! Aah! Oh! Southern Pacific 20-10, this is Colorado State Patrol. Try him again. You know, Tex is an old fella. Just because he doesn't answer his radio doesn't mean... You know, that's odd. There's no smoke coming out of that smokestack. Sy! Sy, get the dispatcher! Buck. Oh, my God. Frank. Back there. Take care of this one. Is that him? The killer's dead. What about your boy? Just hang in there, son. We'll get you to the hospital. He's lost a lot of blood. He's got hypothermia. Help me up. Sir, you better come here. Gracias, amigo. He said the city condemned this place about 2 months ago. Ain't nobody lived here since. He's missing his son. The guy was a killer, Frank. Yeah. But he wasn't a liar. Andy. Daddy! Whoa whoa Whoa oh oh Where I used to have a heart Feels like a mile-wide ditch I got a hole inside The doctor just can't stitch Gone without a trace You left a hollow Place There's not a stone to mark Where I Used to have A heart There were times when I would hold you And feel the poundin' in my chest And now I'm just as empty As a canyon way out west That's how deep I loved you Babe, I love you still To the bottom of this space I'll never fill Where I used to have a heart Feels like a mile-wide ditch I got a hole inside The doctor just can't stitch Gone without a trace You left a hollow Place There's not a stone to mark Where I Used to have A heart Guess I'll learn to live with A different kind of pain I'm sufferin' from a sickness That I cannot give a name It's such a strange sensation I've never felt before Missin' you Has cut me To the core Where I used to have a heart Feels like a mile-wide ditch I got a hole inside The doctor just can't stitch Gone without a trace You left a hollow place There's not a stone to mark Where I Used to have A heart Whoa whoa oh oh Whoa oh ho Oh ooh Where I Used to have A heart
