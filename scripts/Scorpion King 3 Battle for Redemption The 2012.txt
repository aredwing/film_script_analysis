That being able, at one time, to rid the world of an Akkadian and, at the same time, erase the memory of your legendary failures. To your people. As well as to your queen. Your queen was a great sorceress... How was it that she was unable to see her own demise, huh? Did you really think that you could be a leader of men? Hmm? Akkadians are good for but one thing. Destruction. You almost single-handedly decimated a civilization that took over 3,000 years to build. Mathayus, the once mighty Scorpion King, has lost his empire and his beloved queen. With nothing left to live for. His only desire is to die well in the pursuit of mercenary gold, and freedom from the pain that haunts him. King Horus, the most powerful ruler in the world, faces a crisis that could cost him his kingdom. His brother, Ta/us, a ruthless warrior, has taken a legion of SOLDIERS to the Far East to pillage its treasures and amass an army powerful enough to return and conquer Horus' kingdom. Now, Talus marches on the palace of King Ramusan, Horus' last ally in the known world, and guardian of the legendary Book of the Dead. Horus must stop Talus before he lays hands on the Book and enslaves Ramusan's people. For this, he needs a fearless champion willing to accept what is certainly a suicide mission. Well done, Mathayus. Formidable work besting Siris. He was one of my most valued military advisors. That's funny. He didn't seem to have a head for battle. Humor from an Akkadian, proof that anything is possible. We intercepted one of his messenger parcels detailing all of our defensive strongholds. Who was he working for? My brother. Talus. After my father died and left the kingdom to me, Talus became very, very angry. He thought he was the rightful heir to the throne. With all due respect, Your Highness, I have a few vessels of wine and a small army of harem girls to conquer tonight. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me who you want killed? Your royal nobility didn't take long to wear off. Walk with me. The king. Someone that they call Cobra is the leader of the tribal resistance. Naming yourself after a venomous creature? Why didn't I think of that? Once he finds out your mission is to protect King Ramusan, I'm hoping that he comes to your aid. Your chances of survival, Mathayus, are minimal at best. When do I leave? Tomorrow. Well, better start drinking. I only need you to hold Talus off long enough for me to get my army there. King Ramusan will give you 10,000 pieces of gold at the completion of your mission. I will give you another 10 upon my arrival. That is, if you survive long enough to collect it. I'm sending someone with you. I work alone. You know that. Mathayus, you stand to help a great many people. Perhaps that can provide some redemption for past sins. I'll never have redemption for the past. The gods will curse my passing, and I will thank them for it. I do this for money alone. You all fight like little girls. - Which one of your... - Idiots. Mighty warriors will accompany me? Who will challenge me? That one. That ape? Under what rock did you find him? He was one of the only survivors of the great siege of Babylon. We brought him into our ranks because of his unique skill set. My men have yet to embrace him. Go cry to your mama! I wonder why. Ha! Your hat looks stupid. Assassin! You Highness, do you really think this... I'll save you, Sire! Filthy Akkadian, come here. I'll squeeze you. Get off me, maniac! Olaf, have you gone completely stupid? He's an Akkadian, Sire! He's sent to kill you! He's working for me. Olaf's devotion to the realm, albeit humbling, tends to cloud his judgment. My apologies. And you're working with him. Working? What? A quest. Let's drink! Did you bathe in camel dung this morning? I smell like warrior! Well, thank the gods my kingdom is safe. Prepare them for their journey. Well, I met me a girl from Sodom. With a moustache and an ample bottom. She said with a wink as she poured me a drink "If it's big feet you like, I got 'em!" I heard stories about an Akkadian once. Tales of incredible feats in battle. A man so mighty many believed him part God. I do not know much, but of one thing I am certain, you're no Akkadian. That's a mighty mound of horseshit. Oh! I could really go for a sheep's stomach stuffed with crickets. You probably eat like a bird. What's with the hair? How do you get it all straight and shiny like that? Did Mama comb that hair 100 times every night? Or did Grandma have a recipe she passed down through the generations? "Just a hint of bat poop" "with just a touch of monkey testicle." Oh, how about that? Your balls finally dropped. See I finally got you to shut up. You wanna go, Akkadian? Huh? Already going. You call that punching, princess? Or are you courting me with those love taps? Huh? Great humper of sheep? Down you go, Akkadian. At my feet, where you belong. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I mess up your hair? Wait. Let me fix it. Nice try. How does this feel, you filthy swine? You like my face? Let me give you a closer look. Give us your gold or we'll out your throats. Go back to Mama. Hey! What are you doing? My mama sends her regards! They are fools. One-legged sheep moves faster than you. Forget them. You would know! Kiss me, precious. That was the easiest robbery we have done in years. That's about all I can take from you, Akkadian! Mmm. That's good. Now, that's how you stoke a fire. Let's sober you guys up. Nobody touches my stuff! Crime doesn't pay! Olaf, make mine medium rare! At least you'll be able to see where you're going! Not bad. Maybe you are an Akkadian after all. That was fun. Almost broke a sweat. Now where is my baby? There you are. This is a nice camp. It's good of them to get it ready for us. It was a good day. Mmm. That it was. Where are you from? I haven't seen your kind in the desert before. I'm a Teuton from Germania. Land of mountains, snow and ice. Are you crying? No. Dirt in my eye. How'd you end up here? Ha! I came to fight in the great desert wars for gold. I was to take my spoils back home, but I have not earned the fortune I had hoped for. Well, when we help this pitiful king, you shall have them. And I can return to my Olga. Olga, and our 17 daughters. Seventeen daughters? Yes. But I still await a son. It doesn't sound like it's for lack of trying. What about you? What's your history in this place? I have no history. I just want to know where you're from, brother. We're not brothers. You understand? Who pissed in your wineskin? Time for rest. We have many days travel ahead of us. Oh, Olaf, your breath smells like rotten yak carcass. Great gods! What do they feed you cats over here? Olaf. Olaf! Olga? Bye, Olaf. Die well. I've heard tales of such beasts. They look hungry. Don't run. I'm running! Sire, news from King Ramusan's palace. Talus has declared war on Ramusan. Fetch me the rest of my generals. We march tonight. Fetch them! Yes, Sire. By the gods, Talus, I will spill your blood myself for this. The jungle has been known to swallow men whole. I've heard tales of half-monkey men drinking human blood. Excuse me if I don't consider a north country barbarian an expert at jungle warfare. With any luck, we'll make Ramusan's palace by Sundown. Sire, we captured one of Cobra's rebels for interrogation. Ramusan's army is on the move, but the king remains at the palace with the Book. And still no sign of Cobra. What have we? Officer? Or do I give too much credit to these heathens to assume some proper chain of command? Where is Cobra? Is he planning an ambush? He's not shown his face in days. Where is he? Perhaps I should speak just a little bit louder. Might you hear me now? Horus will send an army, if he has not done so already. We must not wait to take Ramusan. Send a detail of men to attack tonight. I could give you two more. Two for you. Come celebrate beautiful cobra. Come celebrate flesh. Very cheap. Thank you. Fat chicken for you. Your Highness! We spotted a detachment of Talus' army approaching from the South! - Move into the palace! - Come on! Quickly! Down the line! Go! Prepare to close the gates. Move! Quickly! Olaf, we may be too late. If we're too late, we're still getting the gold, right? Focus. Look down there. Those are Talus' men. I count 50 men in Talus' royal colors. More like 60, 65. We need a plan. Really? I thought we'd just run down there yelling and thumping our chests, try and scare them to death. That's not a bad idea. Secure the gate! Secure the main door! They come for the Book. These men are assassins. Talus wishes for me to die without honor, while my people defend the land they have owned for centuries. He must never taste victory, only the copper sting of his own blood. Right? What is this? Defend the gate! We could try gorilla fighting. Chimps attack in numbers, like an army trying to overwhelm their enemy. The gorilla does not have the benefit of numbers. He makes the enemy bring the fight to him. More cunning. More deadly. One gorilla is better than 50 chimps. Well, you're not as dumb as you look. Or sound. I'm not even gonna talk about the smell. What are you talking about? I smell delicious. Bring in the beasts! Second positions! It's time for battle. Let's crack some skulls. Repel the ladders! Horus has forsaken us, men! Hold your positions! Hey. Oil. VVhoosh! Fight with me to the end! If we cannot have life, we will have honor! Don't retreat! Move to the wall! Regroup! I should have never trusted an outsider to come to our aid. There's something outside! Attack formation. Quick march. Formation! We cannot see them! Horus has fulfilled his promise. Let's get the gold. Sire, Akkadian and this guy. You're expecting diplomats? Actually, yes. Maybe we should've just asked the bad guys to leave the king alone. Stop. In any case, we are grateful to King Horus for his assistance. And not a moment too soon. Your men have my warmest invitation to enter the palace. - My men? - Your army. The men waiting in the jungle. There's no army, Your Highness. Just us. Oh. Well, I am impressed to say the least. Thank you. Thank you. Normally a victory celebration would be in order, but... But you can't afford to spend any of our gold on it. Yes, we need to discuss the gold. There isn't any. I'm sorry, I thought he just said there isn't any gold. That can't possibly be true. Draw your sword, idiot. Please, please, put away your swords. There is no deceit. My offer to King Horus was made in good faith, but war, as you know, has its cost, and this war has cost me everything. That being said, you've both traveled a great distance to come to our aid, and this kingdom owes you a tremendous debt. Oh. You shall pay in treasure. Well, that will also be acceptable, provided, of course, that it is something of great value. By the gods, that is... A vision of beauty. Reminds me of my Olga. You misunderstand. I do not propose this piece of art as your payment, but rather its subject. My daughter, Princess Silda. I offer to you my daughter's hand in marriage as your reward. Lucky bastard. Very well. I accept. No doubt an offer difficult to decline, but have you forgotten there are two of us? The necklace that she is wearing is the Eye of Gods medallion. I thought that was a myth thieves told their children at bedtime. You mean to tell me it's real? Apparently so. The gods be praised. We shall have it. Yes... Something died inside of you. Where is the princess? Talus has her. He kidnapped her to force my surrender. But as much as I love my daughter, my people must come first. I shall hold off Talus here while you rescue Silda. Save my daughter and earn your seat at the royal table. You and a princess. You mean to kill me. Still, your aim is truer than my palace guards. You know, I have a mind to free your hands for I may starve to death. Look at me. Look at me. Better. You'll definitely be my queen. Though your resistance to me is as preposterous as your affinity to those savages in the jungle that you call your people. They are no more people than the palace monkeys that wipe my bottom. I mean, you see? I am a benevolent, highly entertaining ruler worthy of your hand. You will see this. You will see this, or I will take out your eyes and feed them to the ravens. Sire! News from the East. My champions have held off Talus. King Ramusan's palace is secured. Looks like Talus is preparing for battle. Right here. Line them up. Where are they taking those prisoners? To The front lines. What? I have a plan. This better not involve me. What business have you, heathen? I hear you're paying for front line fodder. Piece of silver for every day one survives the battle. You look like you're good. Oh. No, no, no. Not me. My slave here... We might get a whole week out of this one. Have fun. This way. - Sire. - Yes? A messenger brings news. Your assassins failed to take the palace. They were defeated by an outside force. The messenger believes Cobra came to Ramusan's aid. Fall in formation! And you know this how? Messenger. Are you a sorcerer? Or do you speculate, huh? Oh, fear not. Only a heartless rogue would kill the messenger. Kill him. - Wait. Please. - No! No! Quick work of those savages, press forward without mercy. Ramusan's army approaches, My Lord. Prepare for battle! Attack order! Position! Move! Move! Sound horns! Charge! Fire! Silda. By the gods. I've come to free you. Uh-uh. Would you be quiet? You'll alert the guards. I'm trying to help you. If you don't stop struggling, I'll take you to Abdul. He'll pay highly to add you to his brothel. Good work, Akkadian. Great plan. He gets the girl and I get these fools. Ridiculous. Can somebody help me up? Olaf! Olaf! Where's the girl? Come on! These black warriors are Cobra's men. They've got Silda and they're getting away. I'm going after them. Well, I'll be dipped in donkey dung. Let's crack some heads! Now, let us see how our royal guest is fearing. Sound the alarm. Anybody? Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm! Sire, the princess is gone. Oh really? Was it Cobra? Did you by any chance happen to see these thieves? No, Sire. They hit me so fast that... I want the girl! Now! Yes, sir. Fools! Who is that man? We're on the same side. Give me the girl and the medallion and I'll take it from here. Cobra! Fire! You let them get away? Next time, why don't you send a real warrior in, huh? Here comes Prince Charming. It appears your day has ended a little differently than you expected. Greetings. As you know, some thieves from the resistance have stolen my bride-to-be. As my men are clearly not up for the fight, and you have demonstrated that you are up for the challenge, I would like to procure your services. This is fit for a bribing purse, that's about it. I need much more gold than this. Done. And some women. Done. There will be bonuses if you bring me the head of Cobra, their leader. All of the assassins I have sent have not returned. If you succeed, there will be more gold than your beast can carry. To fail is to die. To refuse my offer is to die. So what say you then? I say we're wasting valuable time. So let me get this straight. I spend the entire day cracking skulls in a war that interests me about as much as camel dung in the desert. Meanwhile, you lose the girl and the medallion, and get us sent into this cursed jungle to battle someone named after the world's most deadly snake, who, by the way, was supposed to be on our side, so that we can get paid twice for the same job. Not bad, huh? Not bad. What about the medallion? That's what we came for. When we find Cobra, we'll find Princess Silda. And at that time, we'll have the medallion. It may seem like a setback now, but it's really gonna work out to our advantage. Don't piss on my head and tell me it's raining, Mathayus. Why do Talus and Cobra care about this meaningless strumpet anyway if they are such mighty warriors? They both know that only royal blood can truly unite the tribes of this land. She's a symbol of a new beginning. I doubt we'll get any gold out of this. What? Quiet. We're close. My belly has a need for mead As I ride upon my warrior steed. There's battles to be fought and wars to be won. I like cracking skulls with my mace just for fun You found a big root, did you? Quite the lesson in Akkadian warrior tracking, pretty boy. I'm sorry. They might hear us and be alerted to our presence! Yeah, if they reside in falling water. We're not alone, Olaf. I'm gonna make some falling water of my own. Adventure of a lifetime my arse. Oh! With friends like you, who needs women? This is gonna feel good. Oh, gods! That's so good! What demons are these? Where's the princess? I have no quarrel with you. You give me back Silda and I'll let you live. Stop! Now quit toying with me. I'd just as soon kill you and find her on my own. Fine! Come on. What in the name of the demon serpent is going on? You got the serpent part right. Mathayus, meet Cobra. It wasn't a dream. More like a nightmare. All right, let me get this straight. You are Cobra, and you got captured as Silda and you freed yourself as Cobra? Staging my capture allowed me to search Talus' entire camp at night, until I found my medallion. Then you two came along and blew a plan that took weeks to execute. Well, perhaps if your father had told us your true identity, you wouldn't have had this problem in the first place. King Ramusan, my father, does not know my secret. Come, Olaf. Let's take leave of this woman. She does not even have the medallion. I'm tired of this upside down country and its ill-mannered rulers. Stop. Or what? You'll say "stop" again? Your pajama-cloaked army is not here to help you, and despite your obvious talents, besting Olaf and I is a bet that will not pay. Wait. Please, wait. Give me one good reason why I should. I'll give you many. After Talus burned their village by the river, they took refuge here in the forest. They can't survive here much longer. Why do you show us this? Because I need your help. Woman, I'm a soldier of fortune. How could I possibly help them? There's much you can do. After all, you are the great Scorpion King. What did you say? What did she say? You heard me. You killed the evil king, Memnon, and saved the sorceress, Cassandra. You made her your queen, and freed a nation. Freed a nation? It's pure fantasy, I can assure you. - More like legend. - Legend? My father told me this story when I was younger. Sounded like a fairy tale. She heard about you from a fairy tale. Quiet. Why so defensive? Is it true? I'm tired of this nonsense. Let's go. You may have heard this fantastic tale, but how would you know it's him if you've never seen his face? That he is Akkadian is obvious. As for being the great Scorpion King, I suspected, but wasn't certain. Until now. Mathayus is a mercenary, not this king you have him confused with. Right? Sire, we are prepared to attack. A spy has returned, but he could not locate the Book. We suspect that Ramusan has hidden it. Of course he has. Catapults, fire! At last, victory is ours. Death to the invaders! Fight to the death! Protect the Book at any cost! If we are to believe his servants, King Ramusan has fled. Without the Book of the Dead? Never. When we find the secret chamber, we find the Book and its keeper. We are warriors, Ramusan. Stop hiding like a quivering handmaiden and bring me the Book. This may be my final breath, but the people of this land will rise above my failures as a king. And you will need much more than the army you brought to break them. You know, you might be correct. Now if only I had a weapon at my disposal that would rid me of these pests. Terribly sorry. You know, it's heavier than I thought. Simply a guide, collection of words is all. The text is useless... Without the medallion, I know. Hathor! Yes, Sire. Hunan. You know, I find it so ironic that soon he too will become part of this text. Very humorous. It's the Book of the Dead. Akkadians are good for but one thing. Destruction. I know you're the Scorpion King. You can say anything you like, but your eyes say it is true. I may have been, but that man is dead and buried. Many names can be shed and forgotten in this life, Mathayus. King is not one of them. Please. Help us. If you truly want to help your people, you'll find a man that did not fail his. The gods have their way, and not even the mightiest of men can stop it. There are more than 500,000 people in this country. Talus will not stop until he enslaves them all to build his empire. Then he will march on Horus' kingdom with the largest army anyone has ever seen before. Fight with me and we can stop him. And maybe, in some small way, you can forgive yourself for the past. I will never forgive myself for the past. Then you will never have a future. Mathayus! Where in Odin's codpiece have you been? I needed to think. And drink. Do you know how long I've been slogging around this forest, fighting off ravenous beasts, looking for you? Why don't you quit your bellyaching? So is this quest over? Even though every fiber in my being is against it, I shall stay and fight. But for my reasons. When we have crushed Talus and sent him back into the dust, that is where it ends for me. Well said, Your Highness. You call me that again, and you will never have that son. You're gonna need a bigger dagger. You're gonna have to let go of everything you know if you're gonna fight with us. Look at Yin. You, watch me! MANI GO, Yin! YOU see? Right! Swatter for insects would be of more use. That's good. Now, what if you are the insect? You defy gravity, anticipate, predict the movements of your predators. Get under your enemy's skin. I'll show you how we do it where I'm from. That was a great move, Olaf. Thank you! Thank you very much. Can we please continue? Let's continue. I think it's your turn, Akkadian. Let's see what you got, pretty boy. If you are the insect, what are you? Scorpion. Not bad. You try. Look at me! I'm a ninja! I can fly! Not bad. Good job. Not too bad. Let's see what you've got. - He challenged the princess. - Whoo! You're gonna take on the girl again, Mathayus? - Huh? - She kicked your butt once. Take him down! I don't know whose hair is prettier. GO, Silda! You can't scare the princess. Oh, here it comes. Teach him a lesson, Silda. That was a good one. Did you see that? You gonna dance all night, or do you want to fight? That's got to hurt. The Cobra will bite you. How's the view, Princess? He loses! Let me guess. I take your breath away. Now that's what I call a courtship. The mighty Olaf. My brother! My Lord, I am Zulu Kondo, lion spirit from the land of the burning sky. Command me! Lord, I am Agromael, noble destroyer. It is an honor to join you in battle. What mortal dares to awaken the warriors of the Book? It is I, Lord Talus, who summons thee back to earth to do battle! I am Tsukai, shadow warrior from the land of the rising sun. What is your will, My Lord? "Will, My Lord? " I believe a demonstration is in order. Kill them all! Well, there's that. Very well. Agromael will stay here and guard me while your cohorts go and kill a snake. Tsukai, I want you to search the ether for my prey, Cobra, and reveal to me his hidden refuge. And when the refuge is found, you will slaughter Cobra and his army without mercy. Well, you're up with the mist. In my vision, I saw a slaughter so vile, it made my stomach turn. As far as the eye could see were the staring gaped-mouth corpses of men cut down to pieces in the muck. And what of us? Oh, our heads screamed silently on wooden spikes. Our bodies burned in a ritual pyre. We still looked fierce though, right? Are you in this for the fight or for her? Both. I cannot lie. She is... She is under my skin, and crawling deeper every day. Do you question my judgment because a woman is involved? On my unborn son, I am with you, Mathayus. To the end. Whatever that may be. To the end. Go to the north side of the camp now. You, get them out of here. Come on. Hurry! Hurry! That can't be good. Silda, what's happening? Talus awakened the ghost warriors. Ghost warriors? The Eye of Gods medallion has great power. If the owner reads from the Book of the Dead, it awakens the warriors from the underworld. The Book of the Dead has been lost for thousands of years. Not lost. It has been with our royal family for many generations. Your father. He would've given his life to protect it. Then he died well. Let it not be in vain. Olaf, we fight! You don't actually believe all this fantastic gibberish, do you? Cobra! Cobra! I am here! Get you and your people to safety. We'll hold them off as long as we can. Time to crack some heads! I've seen you in my vision, Scorpion King. Look at what you have become. You are a disgrace to your people and your queen. Your queen rules from the underworld. You like to join her? I would be happy to reunite you. I'll be joining her soon enough, but it won't be because of your cowardly witchery. Cowards! Come on! Is that all you got? Come on, everybody. Hold those children tight. One step at a time! That's it. Move. Move! Oh, Silda, where are we going? Hold him! Despite your glorious efforts, dear heart, Cobra is still at large. So now your only mission, your only task is to guard the Book. Do you think you can manage that, oh warriors of the etheric hoo-hah? The Book is to only be touched by me. Me alone. Sire, I fear your enemies remain powerful. You underestimate them at your own peril. I feel they are close and plotting. Hmm. Hmm, I feel something, too. I feel that this kingdom... This kingdom, it is mine. And it is 'cause for celebration. So come. A celebration, Lord Talus, is premature. We must remain at the ready. The only thing that you must do is obey me, slave. We are warriors of the Book, My Lord. Not slaves! You are! You are what I say you are. Slave! Unless you want to return to your sarcophagus, I suggest you hold your tongue and you hoist your chalice and prepare for celebration! Slave! Slave, slave, slave! Slave! Slave! Mathayus. Surprise, surprise. You know you can't get rid of me that easy. I thought that one day my people and I'd be free to escape this jungle, return to the land that is rightfully ours. Yet with Talus' monsters waiting to devour us, I fear it will be here we perish. It's always better to fight and be devoured, even if the chance of freedom is slim. What now for you? Do what I always do in these situations. Oh, yes? What's that? Well, return with my prize, collect my bounty, of course. Bounty? Still in it for the money, I see. Well, let's hope Talus thinks so, too. I don't follow. You will. I have a plan. Oh. And now that Ramusan's men are fleeing for their lives, we will soon have the head of Cobra! And from here we will build an empire that will stretch all the way to the desert. Who goes there? Inform the king that we have returned with his prize! Sire, you have guests. Bring them in. Come forward. What a pleasant surprise. I thought you were lost in battle along with your objective. Caution, Sire. The... Silence! Very impressive! And so is that, if that is what I think it is. Our task was made a bit more difficult with your creatures from the underworld killing everything that breathes. I know. They are not very particular. You just point them in a direction and you let them go. Apologies for any hardship. Well, now that you have Princess Silda and the head of Cobra, you can apologize with more gold. Of course, and well-earned. Plus, an invitation. To a wedding! Or an execution. Either way, it's a feast. What shall it be then? Wedding it is. Fantastic. First thing in the morning. And I don't think we need wait for wedding spoils. Do I have a choice in that matter? No. I mean... Play along there, brother. We knew this was going to happen. We have to focus on the task at hand. Yes! Yes! Olaf, is this how you focus? Oh, Mathayus. So Silda was right. The Book is in the treasure chamber under lock and key. And judging by the looks on the guards faces, I would say that thing is in there with them. Oh, don't brood, brother. It was your plan after all, and a great one at that. Look at them. Don't worry. He hasn't tried to bed her yet. You've seen her. Would you wait? Excellent point. We'll toast to her then, for her sacrifice in the line of duty. May I? Ahh. Woman. Not me. Olaf, it's time for battle. Olaf! Olaf. Oh, God! I hate you, Mathayus. You get the Book, I'll get the medallion. Go! What could possibly be taking so long? How much more beautiful can you get? Oh! That much! Kindly pardon my exuberance. You're excused. Where are you, Mathayus? So much for pleasantries. Now that the sword is unsheathed, it is time to Pierce the flesh. Pure poetry, My Lord. Yeah, I know. Let us not rush through this important Eve. We should really enjoy the remainder of the day. Mathayus! After all, this will be my last day as a maiden of purity. Mmm. Take me now, My Lord. Take me! Hurry up! Now would be a good time. Well, have patience, My Lady. It will all be over soon enough. Did you touch her? Did you let him touch you? Best I ever had. Tsukai! Nighty-night! Adventure of a lifetime. What a farce. Give me the medallion. The signal! Attack! I command you to obey me. As you say, My Lord. No! You have to recite the incantation to switch their allegiance. What? Oh, women! Now you tell me. Now that's what I call treasure. I want the medallion. Now! Don't follow me! Finish them! With pleasure. Go get Talus. The medallion is our only chance. Leave this witch to me. Okay. Okay. Come to papa. Oh, it's heavy. Good. Not good. Hi. Talus wanted the Book. No? You can't do that! He's not! You fight well, mortal. Perhaps we'll take you with us. Spend eternity with two mindless brutes and their pet witch? No thank you! You want Mathayus, but he will never stay with you. He is one of the darkness, like us! He only wishes to die. And you are Cobra. Your deception is the poison that is killing your people. Move it! Missed me! The Book! You sure you don't want to go that way? You might have a chance. You should know better than to back an animal into a corner. Who's gonna save you now? You know what? The Book of the Dead already courses through my body. I don't need this trinket. Go ahead. Let them have me. Let them devour me. I will rise again like a bad idea, and you will be crushed. You first. You've been a worthy adversary. Olaf. Well, come on! My Lord, the warriors of the Book are at your service. I'm sorry I deceived you. Please forgive me. There's nothing to forgive, Cobra. I am proud of you, my daughter. With honor, we join you in battle. This battle is over. At least it is for me. My people are in good hands. Father? Father! Father! My champion. You've done well. Is there a problem? Do you need more gold? Consider it done. It's not that, Your Highness. I actually have some gold for you. These are the fortunes of your brother, Talus, minus the expenses it will cost to repair this land. They're rightfully yours. I don't understand. I could've easily retrieved it from the palace myself. Probably not a good idea. Meaning? With all due respect, Your Highness, you're not welcome here. These people will no longer accept foreign rule. Now, they are grateful for everything you have done to help them to be free, but they are willing to fight to stay that way. Will they now? Well, since they have sent you as their messenger, tell them this. It's not their decision to make. I have not come as their messenger, Sire. I have come as their king. You expect me to accept your claim to the throne, uncontested? I expect nothing more than your respect. For myself and for the people of this land. Now, if it is a fight that you are looking for, then you shall have it. You surprise me, Akkadian. I thought that you had traded in your royal nobility for a few sacks of gold. I had. But now, if need be, I'm willing to trade my life to get it back. I believe you. And whether I give you my blessing or my blade, I respect you. But I must confer with my generals. When you are the king, the concerns of the realm come first and foremost. But you already knew that, didn't you?
