I'm looking for this village... Seem to have lost my way. No problem you are here.|This is Ban Kok Putsa. I have important news to tell you... I've come a long way... "Amazing Thailand", 6,000 miles. Another continent, another culture,|another planet. Great feeling to be leaving England behind. Don't know what to expect... but hoping for something new. Thailand was Kate's idea|to develop our relationship. But driving from the airport, Bangkok didn't quite seem|what we had expected. Somehow I'd imagined something|a little less... concrete, less western. Twenty baht, huh? Hey, want to look here, madam.|Have everything you want. Check this. Come on, Kate. - What're you doing?|- I thought you needed a bed. Can't you just wait a minute? So let's dump the bags...|then go shopping yeah... You want room? Have room here. I'm going out. Going out where? Don't know... somewhere... outside. Meet some locals. By yourself? For a couple of hours, yeah... - What?|- Nothing. Give me a break. You want a break, fine, have one. but I won't be here when you get back. - Come on Kate. You're tired...|- Well, you noticed. You've been acting funny|since you been on the plane. Yeah... well, travel does that|to some people. And after all I am a woman... Tell me about it. Maybe we should just forget it. What do you mean? Never mind. No, what do you mean? Adam, just go out and meet your locals. If you've got something to say Kate,|just say it. Adam just leave it. - No... what have you got to say.|- Right. I don't fancy you anymore. You've brought me all this way|to tell me that. No, Adam. I've brought myself|all this way to relax. And you are just irritating... and so heavy. Yes Sir. I can take you. A helpful guy in a tuk-tuk offered|to show me around... VIP Massage, Good for you. ...but gazing at girls in a goldfish|bowl isn't really my scene. And the endless rows of watches,|CDs and designer labels... only reminded me of|what I'm trying to escape from. So I wandered off down|an old railway track... and got my first taste of Tom Yum soup|and Thai wisdom. Farang, farang. Sit down, sit down. Farang? What is farang? Farang mean foreigner. You farang. If you think good, speak good,|do good, happiness come. If you think no good,|speak no good, do no good, problem come. Chork Dee. Good luck for you. Kate? Adam, I had to cash my cheques,|here is your share... sorry, its so bulky but you should|get yourself organised next time. You see, I meant it.|Better we go our separate ways - maybe this trip will make a man of you. See you on the flight home.|Kisses, Kate... PS. Don't come looking for me. For a moment, Kate's note was a shock... then there was a weird sense of relief... so when I heard her laughing, it was as if I hadn't known her at all. Let's get acquainted. You want to bought me.|I see you look me, madam. I have everything you want. Check me. Day 2|Break up with my girlfriend on first night... going to take a bus south. Inside. Chaweng. Chaweng. Yeah, I'll take it. I'm really sorry. Was that your dinner? I'm sorry. Here. Um... (Out... Mai-ao. Mai-ao. ) Um... you have small money? No, I haven't. It's... it's ok.|Mai pen rai. You speak Thai? Oh, just phrasebook stuff you know. Mai pen rai-no problem. Isn't that the first thing you learn|when you get here? Sabai, sabai. Sabai, sabai. What does that mean? Take it easy... Come on. You want to play or not? I'd love to but I don't think|they gonna let me. Sorry, enjoy your food, yeah. Bye. (OUT Puchai Khon Nee Loe Dee Nor. ) (OUT Jai Dee Duay. (Good Heart) Let's go. Finally. Wait. Come on. Your serve. Where you going handsome man? sit down. - No no, I'm just...|- Do you want to drink? - No no, I'm not stopping.|- You got lady? No... er... no no no, got no lady. You want to go with me? No... er... well, I'd love to but as|I say I'm just looking around, yeah? If you go with me, good for you and good for me. I take care. No charge for you.|I give for free. Lor (Handsome). Look, maybe I come back. Yeah... - Are you sure?|- Maybe. - Sure?|- Sure. See you later yeah? I don't have money.|My family is very poor. Yeah, baby. That's sweet. Excuse me sir. How old are you? Yeah, Sorry,|can I have like er... local beer, - Thai beer, or something?|- No... no, no, no. Try some of this local grog,|recommended. Sharpens vision, mildly hallucinogenic. Sounds like a bit in contradiction? New boy in town, ah? Yeah, just been acquainting myself|with the local customs. No, no, no, I'll get these. I'd be careful carrying that|lot around if I was you, specially if you're having a couple|of these, ha. Yeah, well... its my divorce settlement. Ah... not another broken marriage? Yeah, Unbelievable, first night. That's no world record in this place son. This place does strange things to people. Sounds like the voice of experience. Oh yes. So what do you do,|like work here or something? I've got my finger in a few little pies,|you know. It's a great life. Come along, chin-chin. Oh... fuck me. Have you tried Thai massage yet? Man, you see,|the beauty about Thai massage... apart from its health benefits... is that you can just lie back, relax. For one whole hour... some beautiful young woman|is going to pay your body... the biggest compliment its ever received. And it's Unconditional. - But you've got to pay for it?|- Of course you have to pay. So it's not exactly Unconditional then is it? I'm talking about the emotional stuff. No need to get all anxious|about "satisfying your partner". I bet your girlfriend never touched you... without expecting something in return. And you pay 200 baht for an hour - I mean, what's that,|the price of a Big Mac? You know you'd pay ten times|that in England, that's if you could even find|a genuine massage! So it's not an excuse for sex? Oh no, no, no,|this is a spiritual experience. Why don't I take you down to Sao's? This wouldn't happen to be one|of pies you have your finger in? You could say that, and a very tasty pie too, I may add. Hey get it Joey? Throw away, Jimmy. Here, did I tell you to be careful|of backstreet blowjobs with ladyboys. No, it wasn't the first thing on my agenda. I don't care what you are,|if you are a faggot or anything. I don't care.|But you've got to watch them ladyboys. Oh... I love you long time. Yeah, I'll show you what they do, right.|Undo your pants. - Fuck off.|- Come on. Undo your pants is a scientific|demonstration. - You're having a laugh aren't you?|- This is essential information... which you need to know|for your well-being on this island. God Almighty Listen, so they undo your pants... and then they'll pull them down|round your ankles, right... and they start giving head, oh... yeah... enjoy... you're counting stars. and what happens...|they've got their hand in your pockets. Catch me... So you know the language then, Joey? Oh well, you gotta know the essentials. You know, like Mao-drunk, Ting Tong-crazy and Fun Dee-sweet dreams. You gotta watch the tones, you know. For example, you can describe|a woman as suaay-beautiful. But if you pronounce it suay, it means bad Luck. I guess you could say some of them|around here are both. Look at this honey, mate? Hallo, massage! Thanks, Sao. Me no have. Hairy arms? Glad to hear it. What do you think? Yeah, are these all the girls? I can see you're a man|of discerning good taste. Come on inside.|We'll see what we can find in there. Okay. Thank you very much. - Nice to meet you.|- Bye. No... no. Em, this your birthday present.

I could stay a lot longer if I like. Can I take you out for some dinner? Cannot. Working. What time do you finish work? Um... Midnight. Okay, well I'll come back then. Cannot. Sleeping. Can I see you another time? Um... tomorrow morning, 10 o'clock. I'll show you island, OK? OK. See you. This is another planet. Thought I knew what life was in England... but this is a whole new reality. I don't know if I can quite hold it together, but I'm sure I'm not the first. Hallo, massage. Hallo, massage. Em, Em. Come on in. I'll catch you. Cannot, I shy Adam. Come on. Cannot. Day 3. Em taught me|how to pay respect to Buddha. Sorry. No problem. You Farang, you on holiday. Okay, I like you. But cannot do like this. Hom better. Hom is a Thai kiss. A sniff, which I haven't quite|gonna hang on yet. Thank you for showing me little Buddha. Tomorrow I show you big Buddha. Thank you. (OUT - Thai Lung. Pla-muk-suk-ru-yung? )|Are the squids cooked? I thought you didn't kiss like that. It's OK.I watch Hollywood movie. The kiss was everything. But it wasn't enough. Darling... you buy me drink? Sure. What would you like? What'd you like? I want cola. You forget me? Okay, Two cola. - And me.|- And me. - And me.|- Five cola, that's it. Short time 1,000 baht. OK? Small money for farang. How much if I want you all night? Love me, longtime, 2,000 baht. It's too much. No. Good price for Farang. OK? Well, I didn't come 6,000 miles|to play Connect 4! Bye bye, handsome man. I know it was the booze|and flirting which took me to Noi's bar. But at the time it felt like something else, affecting every action,|every thought and word, something more intense, more real. Walking Noi home|I knew that eyes were watching Us. I was doing something crass... but I went ahead and did it anyway. Why am I doing this? Sorry. Oh... fuck. I met this girl and|I shouldn't be doing this with you. Customer often feel confused, They love his wife, but come to me. I'm scared that if me and this girl|make love it'll mess things Up. So wait... in Thailand, boyfriend and girlfriend|they should wait Until marriage. Yeah, But I am from England|and we have sex before... before we even leave school. Sure. Everyone loves sex.|But you have to ask yourself... "How do I feel in the morning?" How do you mean? How you feel afterwards? Um... Think about eating junk food. Taste good|but afterward your stomach... ah... Same-same sex. If your heart feel happy it's ok. If your heart feel bad, it's no good. Heavy heart or heavy balls. It's Up to you. So why do you do this work Noi? How can I find job|which pay me same money. I Use my body and I also Use my head. One day I want to buy my own land. But how can you make love|with some of these Ugly, old men? I choose customer. And I choose you... because you are jai-dee and good heart. - Can you stay long time.|- No, I have to go. We make love one time|but you give me two times. Mai-Pen-Rai. Thank you. This morning|I desperately needed to see Em. I know I've fucked up. But did she know? Your friends are always joking. Maybe I'll wait around Until Joey gets back. You have lady in England? No. Finished. - You have lady in Thailand?|- No. Are you butterfly man? What is a butterfly man? Someone who go from lady|to lady to lady. No, I don't think so. You meet lady last night? No, I meet you last night. After massage, where you go? I went dancing, drinking and then walked back|to my bungalow, alone. No problem.|You're on holiday, Pinnochio. The moment I lied I could feel the effect. Tham-nai-na? (Why? ) Mai-pen-rai-na, Em.

So you are saying you didn't see anyone. No. Hallo Massage. Em, can I speak to you, please? Butterfly Man, no problem. Me, helicopter woman. Where is my present? Em, I've got a big problem -|can I speak to you alone please? Sit down. Can I speak to you over there? Where is my present? Look, Em.

I was with another woman the other night. I know. Can I make things good again? No. Better we finish now. Today I started selling my clothes. The old man in Bangkok|had been talking about Karma. Maybe I got what I deserved, But making my peace with Em|seemed to have changed my luck. Gin-kao-kon-kha. (Eat) Puchai lor jai dee na.|(Handsome man with good heart) Buy cola for me? Noi! Got no money for drink I'm afraid. Joking, joking, I know. Whole town talking about|crazy farang who lost his money. Here. For you. What's this for? Good Luck, Adam. Yo! I've been looking all over town|for you, man. Yeah. They told me down the massage|you've had your money stolen. Yeah. 'fraid so. Bad one. Come on, I'll get you a beer. I might have a little job|you can do for me if you're interested. Yeah? A bit of couriering work. Pay you enough to get you back|to Bangkok. Maybe a little left over|to do some shopping. Courier work, sounds a bit dodgy. There's a few of us westerners|who have businesses here. Every ninety days right|we need to get our visas renewed. So this means go all the way down|to Malaysia on the train, crossing the border, then hanging around|another couple of days... while the passports are stamped. Well, the thing is, there's someone, on the next island|who has the necessary stamp. So what you've gotta do is hop over there. Wait around for a couple of days|for the passport then come back. I'll pay you 1,000 Baht Upfront|4,000 on delivery. Why don't you go yourself? Like I said I've got a business|to run here, you know, we all have. So me and my colleague|we've chipped in 250 baht. "Good for me, good for you". Why don't you just Use a local|it'll cost you a fraction of that price? Hey, I'm trying to do you|a favour here, man. You know I need the job doing|quickly, not sabai, sabai. You know I had you down as a reliable|conscientious young lad... in a bit of trouble, you know... but...|if you're not interested... No, no, it's not that|I'm not interested, but its... just that it isn't legal right? Let's just call it a convenience service, bypass a lot of red tape, save a lot of time. What about the police? You're only hopping on|and off a boat, aren't you? You're not crossing any national borders. Anyway the police know us,|they like having us here. We make money for the island. So long as you keep yourself|to your self, you'll be fine. Are you in? Okay. Come and meet Bill,|he takes care of our admin stuff. Hey Bill. How is it going? This is the kid I told you|about to do the couriering work for us. Good, good. Let's go in the office. (Moon-Sa-pok) Swing that hip. All right. Let's go. I want this back in two days. Sure. Where do I go? When you disembark you take|a songthaew to "Jungle Resort". At "Jungle Resort"|you give this package... to "No Name" no one else. Got it? - "No Name"?|- That's right. "No Name" - No papers, no problem. Invisible. Yeah, well, if it's all the same to you, I think I've changed my mind. I hope we're not going|to have trouble with your boy. No. We made a deal. Shook on it. Isn't an Englishman's handshake his word? A little bit before my time. Anyway, it's no big deal, isn't it?|I'm sure you'll find someone else. Okay. Time out here. I don't know where you found|this timewaster... but you've got two minutes|to sort this situation out - two minutes. Speak to him. What are you trying to do to me here son? You know, you're right, its no big deal. But we did make a deal. And to tell you the truth|I get a little of pissed off... when people start wasting my time... and I know Mr Kincaid certainly does. And I tell you something else. He is not adverse to his hand|in at the old Muay Thai Boxing. He is an ex-champion, you know? We made a deal. It's too late|to start going back on it now. So what if I just fucked off. Mr. Kincaid has some friends|who very high places. You wouldn't even get back|to the mainland. Fine, whatever. I'll do the fucking run. Right. Bill! Are we all friendly again? I want you to double my fee. Ah, how much did you agree? 1,000 Up front, 4,000 on delivery. Nine more when you get back. I want you to be on that boat|at 10.30 tomorrow morning. Fine. I'll call later, Bill. I'm sorry to get heavy-handed|with you in there, the thing is,|Mr. Kincaid is a big guy round here. He likes a bit of a show, you know. I know you'll be back. Yeah, sure. look|I want to see Em. A friendly word of advice for you ok? forget her. I mean she's a sweet kid|but you know this is all she knows... and you're nothing special -|you're just passing through. If I was you I'd pick Up my money|and head straight back to England... before this place really fucks you up. Jungle Retreat. Good morning Sir. Welcome to the Jungle Retreat Health|and Beauty Centre.
