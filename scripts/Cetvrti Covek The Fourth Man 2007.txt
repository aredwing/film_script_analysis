Here I'll show you.. . The bullet... The bullet missed the center. .. The center.. . Be still. .. You have a cigarette? Doctor! Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Do you have a cigarette? You see, two months in a coma is a long period. However, his condition is now stable. He has regained his sight and hearing. It's amazing that the bullet went through his skull without damaging any of the vital centers. We have been keeping him under intense observation for but lamentably, there has been no progress. Chances are he may never regain his memory. Are you sure? The psychiatrist working with him says it's total amnesia. Colonel? He really doesn't know who he is. Be careful. Some information could create a chaos in his brain.. . We've told him about the wounding and the coma, but we've made no mention of certain events. .. You are back with us! You don't know who I am? Have you got a cigarette? You know I quit smoking... Sorry. The doctor told me you can't remember a thing. .. Then you don't remember this either? No. Who are you? We've worked together for 1 6 years. You, Zarkovic and me. What did we do? What the Government asked us to do. For example? You were shot in the head. In your apartment. Point blank. We don't know who did it . Nor do we know why. Should you remember anything.. . Do you have a cigarette? You had a wife and a son. .. Both Sonja and Milos were killed when you were wounded. You were all at home that day. I'll be going now.. . We'll be in touch, major. There is a chance that your memory may slowly come back in fragments, but meanwhile life goes on. You should take on with this new situation. If they didn't tell you, I.. . -I know.. . You have no idea who you are. Nice horse. Is that water over there? Can I. ..? How old was he? Who? My son. I was assigned to the case. Didn't they tell you? We came following an anonymous call. Found a bloodbath one rarely sees. We nicely combed everything but found nothing. I knew I had to work quick, because Your service doesn't like anyone to meddle in its affairs. What service? MS A Military Security Agency. The Army intelligence. ARMINT if you like. Anyway, the investigation was interrupted after two hours. You didn't know that either? Right! They're hiding it. But that's where they made a mistake. Because everything I start working on, I finish. And I think I know who did it. So, why don't you arrest them? It's not that simple, buddy.. . Now I really have to go. Cigarettes. Not that.That is what you've been admitted in. That was left for you by your friend, the colonel. Supposedly a water pipe burst in the apparent above. The Pride Club.. . may I help you? I didn't order a whiskey. -You always drink Jack Daniel's. Are you sure? -Well, I'm sure. They you surely know my name? Give me a beer. My deepest condolences, dear neighbor! -Thank you. I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am. I just remembered the other day how you and your son carried the stove up for me up the stairs.. . You remember? Milos, such a wonderful boy. What a terrible tragedy. I would have visited you at the hospital, but I didn't know which one. Can I ask you something? Ask . .. Are you feeling better now? Yes. I already thought you decided to forget everything. Here, this is you. Only first class assignments. Croatia, Bosnia, Rwanda.. . Covert operations through out Europe.. . All that the Government required. .. You were their special assignments man, so to say. You said you knew who killed me. Who tried to kill you. Yes, I said I think I know.. I'm listening. Don't you think it's strange that they're letting you wonder around, sit in bars. ..? They surely aren't amateurs to let someone just stroll freely? Come to the point. They're waiting. Waiting for what? They are waiting for you to take them to something that they want desperately. Something that only you know where it actually is. What? I have no idea. Look at it this way. You're working on a case, you get your hands on some documents, objects. Some information you shouldn't know about. And before you even realize what you have, they come and liquidate you and eliminate your family. But, then they don't find what they were looking for. And you even survive! And then the second bummer: you've got amnesia. What they want get hold of, the thing only you know where it's hidden, could ruin them even if you're dead. They're scared shitless. That's why they're waiting. Who's scared shitless? Maybe this can help you. Who's this? -The man you were tailing before you got killed. Before they failed to kill you. A businessman. A fine gentleman. The king of transition. No one can lay a finger on him. And he just loooves to have his photos taken in the company of politicians.. . Rich as Creusus. -And...? ''And'' what? How would I know? Ties with organized crime, military, maybe something even worse. You were working on it. You should know what was in the box you opened. - What is it you want from me? I want to get to the truth. Why are you so much interested in the truth? Let's say... I'm sick of it all. And that I have absolutely nothing to loose. Let's say your bullshitting. Let's say this is all a lie. What if it isn't? This is only the tip of the iceberg! You'll understand that eventually. Yes, please? A Jack Daniel's and another coffee for me. -I'll have a beer. You've always had Jack Daniel's. I didn't know. I'll keep that in mind. I was an assassin? You were a professional. A professional assassin? A professional soldier. Who killed when state interests required it... -Right. What was I working on when they tried to. ..? I don't know, I was in Kosovo then. Who terminated the investigation? That's strange. I don't know who. Someone high up. And you don't have a clue? -I don't. Both we and the police received instructions that your entire case was being placed ad acta. Why isn't anyone putting me back on the job? Well, you still can't remember a thing. What happened to the documents I had with me? Are you interrogating me now? -Yes. I don't know what you're talking about. What documents? Maybe my memory has started seeping back. Maybe you never lost it. What documents? You're lying that you don't know. If you remembered me, you'd know I'm not lying. If I remembered to you,I'd never be having a drink with you. I'm your best friend. Thanks. You asshole! You know, that just wasn't nice. You could have called. I was.. .absent for a while. On business. And you? I still work here, even though you stopped coming. When did you start drinking beer?! Recently. What will you have? -Martini Bianco, he knows. Why are you looking at me that way? And how am I looking at you? As if you had seen me for the first time. Let me guess! She's visiting her parents with your son, and you just couldn't sleep. How do you know I'm still free? Three months.. . ! Finish your drink and leave... Please. The drinks are on me. Thanks. And don't come back. I swore I would never again.. . What's happening? Where are they? They're gone. Gone? Where? Never mind. You separated? In a way. You're much more handsome when you smile. When was this taken? I don't know. How can you not know? I just don't. You must remember. Some things can't be forgotten just like that.. . I have forgotten that and everything else. I have lost my memory. What's your name? Theodora. ''God's gift''. You've already told me that once.. . When we first met. Regardless of all the problems, and in spite of the fact that many of our enemies would rejoice if we were to loose this rate of growth and such progress, when a man has behind him a team like mine... Here you are. Enter the password. Would you like to know it? -Excuse me, major, Sir! SONJ A. Password rejected. MI LOS. Password rejected. Yes. THEODORA. Password rejected. GOD'S GIF Password accepted. STATUS: IN ACTIVE. IN 1 999 HE ABBANDONED THE STATE SECURITY SERVICE UNDER UNCLEAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND FAI LS TO APPEAR IN PUBLIC UNTILL MAY 2003, WHEN HE FORMED ACOMPANY C ALLED ''MONOPOLIS GROUP''. CONTACTS WITH THE CRIME WORLD EX ISTENT BU WITHOUT VALID EVIDENCE. DRUG ROUTES He's alive. - Get the doctor. Shit! My friend, life is cruel. I really don't know what to tell you.. . Fuck sell it all.. . Sell your wife and then sell your children. Just get it back. I don't care! Sell your ass! Whatever you do, don't forget that I expect the money to be in my account by Friday. Hell! Who the fuck are you? -You tell me! You're a dead man, you motherfucker! Do you fucking realize who I am, you son-of-a-bitch? Tell me about my family. Fuck you and your family, you asshole! Do you have any idea who I operate with? Are you deranged or what? You want to sip your own balls on a straw from a glass. Go on, speak! Who sent you?! Don Cornbread send you? It is Cornbread isn't it? My wife and son sent me. Fuck your wife and your son, you two-bit motherfucker! !! Quiet! -You gotta be crazy! Do you really think I'm afraid of you? You pussy, you just don't have the balls for lt! You plece of shlt!!! -Sllence!!! Fuck you ! You stupid ape!! -Silence! !!! !! Screw you ! You don't have the guts for it! Aaaaah ! ''MONOPOLIS GROUP'' OWNER KI LLED.. . THE CHARRED BOD Y DISCO VERED B Y THE GAM EKEEPER. I should arrest you. -Here's your chance. What are you waiting for? I'll wait for the customary I'm in mourning. Haven't got the time. You have a strange sense of justice. But I have one! And that's very important. This is how things stand: they have nothing... absolutely nothing. All they know is that it was the work of a professional. Did you find something out? I've cheated on my wife. So what? Who's behind the berg? -What berg!? You said this was just the tip of the iceberg. -I said it, yes. Did you get something out of him? -No. You killed him without getting out a thing? I sent you in there. I wanted to help you to. .. to learn the truth. And you went fuckin' Rambo on me instead. Don't get me wrong, I really don't give a fuck when one of those assholes gets wasted but I don't want to go down because of it! I understand. -No you don't! It would be best if none of this had happened. And it's best now if we just part... -All right. Not all right! It's my job to arrest people. Not to kill them. My daughter, Milica. They found her in a dumpster. Thrown in there by those that got her hocked on heroin. There was nothing I could do. I had no firm evidence. And my colleagues tried to hide from me that she'd been raped. All the time I've been asking myself, what my share was in this tragedy. What was I in for. Now I know what I'm in for.. . Fuck the evidence. Fuck arrests! The should all be wasted. I've been trying for ten years to get him . Understand? Ten years, and nothing. Cocaine, prostitution, white slavery.. . trafficking Moldavians to the war zones, assassinations, you name it. Now he's turned legit. Growing pigs. I guess he gets high on the stench? Now I there's someone I'd like to see roasted - then it's him ! For 3 months we've had him under close surveillance and couldn't find a thing to stick on him. By the way, he's a great friend of our flambed businessman. Had they not killed you, you would have followed the path straight to him. The assassination of your family has his handwriting all over it. Take this.. . might come useful. Now you really are dumb, you guys! Didn't I tell you that the law enforcement officers are our friends?! Sorry, buddy. Have a seat. Really I am sorry.. . -Thank you. Hello? Petrovic, my man ! What's up? Listen, are there some unsettled scores between us? What do you mean ''What do I mean''? I got myself one of your boys here. He's not yours? Put that down. That's bad manners, my son. -Who tried to kill me? I never saw you in my life, bro. -You know perfectly well who am I. And do you know who I am? -I do. You do? If you really did, you wouldn't be here. Right, Mile? -Right, boss! And why is that Mile? Who am I? An honest pig farmer. And it's a known fact we in the food industry process meat. Get it, cop? Now, be nice and put that down. Mile will pack you up a kilo of fresh sausages... To take home.. All right? Nice photo. You killed them . Fuck! What's wrong with you, son. You're angry or something? I'm not angry. .. .He has been killed around 1 1 p. m . tonight in his house in Surcin, were are in front of it now. Where to, gentlemen? ...the motive of the murder is being sought and we expect that. .. What are you doing here? You see, we're kind of busy now, and you might drop by some other time. Better yet, never again. You're right. My condolences. You've lost a dear friend and associate. Hands up! Hands up! They all fit your description, more or less. All you have to do is concentrate. And everything will be all right. What are you doing?! Madam, you want a tissue? It's all right. No thank you. You have a wonderful daughter. -What? Yesterday was her first day at the kindergarten, right? Pity. .. What are you talking about. .? You're meddling into things that don't concern you. I don't understand. There are many things in life that are more important. Like your little daughter. Think about it. Are you kidding me? You remember nothing now? Nothing. You must be putting me on. Say you're putting me on ! I'm not putting you on. People, she's not putting me on! !! What is it? -I'm afraid. Of what? Of myself. They're dead, you know. -I know. How do you know? I asked around a little. You knew what my line of work was? Roughly. And? What was I like with you? You're confusing me. You're different. I have the feeling that you see me now. Before I thought you didn't even notice me. Why were you with a guy like me? I so turned on by you. Even though you used to be mean sometimes. -And now? Hey, I'm the chick! I get the compliments! Clear? Go on, sleep. I will. You'll stay here? You want me to? -I do. He had no idea who I was, nor my family. How do you know that? I showed him the photo. He wasn't scared a bit. - So what? Nothing. Let's say it's over now. -What's over? Our little agreement. I don't want to see you ever again. I'm telling you this as a favor. You got into this on your own. I didn't force you. You even dragged me into it all. Let's agree on one thing - no one is innocent there. Your family was killed with a shot at the back of the head. Now you tell me if this is the right moment to get a conscience crisis. Do you really think you can just get up and walk away? Without me you wouldn't exist, get it? I gave you an identity. There's no going back! Good evening, dear neighbor. -Oh, good evening! How are you? -Not so bad... I don't like freshwater fish from the rivers. It's somehow greasy and smelly. My grandpa used to take me out to sea on his fishing boat. I wanted to be a boy. Do you like the sea? You don't know... Your amnesia is so boring! You know, I'm in love with you. Didn't you say you were with me just because in bed we...? You jerk! I shouldn't have told you. Did I know it? That you felt. .. this for me? Back then I was just horny.. . Now I'm in love. Here's a difference. I feel secure, for the first time in my life.. . I know that you will protect me. Do you want to try this? No taxi. I think I see one. I want to know what's happening. I rarely read the papers. Don't fuck with me. Tell me why are you doing it? A professional ! You've lost your mind - not your memory! Do you realize who you liquidated? Why don't you arrest me? You think they killed your family? You fool! Who sold you that story? Who stopped the investigation?! What's that got to do with it now? Who stopped the investigation?! -I did. Why? -Because! Why? To save you. .. You're lying. Good day. -Good day. You're not mistaken. I just brought some brown sugar for Theodora. -Thank you. I thought I had none, but then I found some in the cupboard. Imagine that! Thank you. May I just ask, how are you now? -Fine. I'm fine. I'm so glad. You know, I owe you ever so much. I'm concerned about you. - Thank you. Good bye. You know you look much better than the last time! I know I do. Have a nice day. -Good bye. It's you ! -Who did you expect? I guess we won't die of food poisoning. You try first. I noticed you've started charming the neighborhood. Mhm ... The sweet old lady lives alone. A high school professor if I got it right. My impression is she drinks a little. -Where did that suitcase come from? Oh, a friend of yours left it. -What friend? Inspector... something. I forgot the name. He sent you his regards and said you'd know what that is. And what else did he say? Oh, nothing special. ..That you told him so much about me. .. He said it's so nice that we are together. .. and blah-blah-blah. You have five minutes to get ready and then we eat! So, you're the one. You're really good if you managed to get all the way here. I've underestimated you. Do you recognize me? Should I? I guess you don't. So, what now? You're certainly not interested in money. Maybe something else. .. You know I can arrange things. Sorry. This should not have happened. Daddy, daddy! Why aren't you in bed, son? -I'm thirsty. Go on, have some water. Pour it for me. What do we say? Thank you. .. Aaah, you're dead! Surrender! You`re dead. Now this nice gentleman will give you that gun. Bring it over to daddy. Now go straight to bed. Can I stay and play with you? -No, it's late! I've always wondered how does one get into your line of work. To be honest, reporters often ask me how did I get into politics. I'm a dentist by trade,you know. I used to be one, before... Ugly job. Almost like politics. If I were cynical, I'd call it a bloody job. But, as you know, am not a Cynic. Positive energy is what I give the people, and that's why they like me. That's my weakness and I don't have many of those. Well, never mind.. . Tell me, who sent you? Who is the man that hired you to do this? Who wants to waste me? Who wants to take us over? I thought you more intelligent. A man must know when it's over. It's the only way one goes ahead in life. Why don't you try the coffee? So, no communication? No exchange of lines and thoughts. Are you religious? There's something in it... more in the metaphorical sense. A man in my position gets to see all sorts of things. Gets to know the human soul.. . and stops believing in it. You look like a man who's aware of those issues.. . But you don't want to cooperate. Right.. . Let's go or do you want to wait for the police? Will you leave her alone now? She's got nothing to do with this. We're all involved. Whether we like it or not. Is it all over now? Almost. There's still the fourth man. The fourth man? I promised you the truth. Finally you will meet the man that shot you. I've had enough. Isn't it a bit late for that? Who are you? Lie down.. . He's gone. He only said to tell you that what you're looking for, why all this happened, that this thing is in this apartment. .. Where? He left that when he came here. -Where? I don't know. He hide it after the death of your family, but today he put it back where he had found it. Do you have a place to go? I do. Listen to me carefully and just trust me. .. Get it? -I do. Don't go back to your apartment. If you need money take some from the box in the closet. Take it all.. . In two days time we'll meet at the railway station. If I don't show up, don't look for me. Just get on a train and leave. Doesn't matter where, just leave. Do you understand? Come with me, please. .. I can't. Go.. . Who killed them !? I'm asking you who killed them !? -Some troops. Some troops? Wouldn't those be your troops? Go on ! So, you've come home! I'm speaking to you, junkie! Sonja, give me some clean clothes. I'm leaving on an assignment again. What are packing those things for?! We're leaving, Lazar. What are you talking about? -Don't come near me. Will you tell me what this is about? -What is it about?! ! It's about Milos coming back home to get some money for the drugs, turning the whole house and finding your hidden tape, you monster! The tape. .. Damned tape! What the fuck are you looking at it, you prick! Sonja, let me explain about the tape. -Don't you touch me!! ! I can explain. .. Explain what! You nearly killed your own child! Look at the stat he's in. Get away from me! You're going nowhere! I don't want to see you ever again. You're going nowhere. Is that clear? Let her go! Milos.. . Put the gun down! Get away! Move! Drop the gun, I tell you ! Milos, don't make me come over.. . Drop it, you hear! Drop the gun, I tell you ! Milos!? Go on. .. Please, please shoot. Please... Please. .. God damn you ! !! What are you doing!? Ten of theirs, for ten of our own! What the fuck! Turn that shit off. Turn it off, now! Give me the tape! Give me the tape! I want the CSI team report in two hours! Understood...? We'll take it from here. Forget it. I said, forget it. The SIA is taking over! Drive. Where to? His place. First floor. Yes? I know. I'm coming. Right, I'll be there. .. I found the cassette. You didn't destroy it? You didn't quit smoking either. With this you wanted to see if I remembered. I thought you were dead. I took away your gun so the Police wouldn't find it. I made everything look like an assassination and then stopped the investigation. Even dead, I was protecting you. Because I had made you! Everyone knew that Sonja and Milos wanted to get away from you, but they didn't dare. They were too much afraid of you. That thing in Bosnia should not have happened. But, damn, it did. We lost control. Sure... Everyone happens to kill a few innocent civilians. I had ordered both you and Zarkovic to destroy the tape. You wanted us to end up at the Hague? What the fuck did you keep it for? Who is Zarkovic? He was the one that shot the tape. Where is he now? After Bosnia he quickly disappeared. Went back to the Security and Intelligence Agency - the SIA. All the time he was their man planted among us. They protected him from the war crimes tribunal and from us. Gave him a new identity. You and I managed to located him. But we couldn't get near him. He'd become to strong. You ran into some major leaguers. Now you understand that none of those that you killed had anything to do with you or your family, nor with Bosnia. Who tricked you? Why are you laughing, you fool? No reason. .. The man that used you is about to take over the strongest criminal organization in Serbia. You have to tell me who is it! Him. And, what will you do now? Now, I kill you. Why? Because otherwise you'll kill me. Why would I do that? Because I might no longer keep our little secrets. The state fucked us up real fine. What ever they asked... this - that, there - here . .. . The colonel and the major were happy to oblige. The system fucked us up and the various Zarkovic. Not just this particular one. We trusted them blindly and dropped our pants down for them. And now we're moaning. Fuck us! Fuck you! Ten of theirs, for ten of our own! What the fuck! We were just enjoying the movie. I'm the author, you know. Give me the tape! In position, over. Roger, Eagle. Stay in position. Give me 5 minutes. Roger! Over and out. I'm the fourth man, Zarkovic. So, you figured it out? It's time for you to take revenge. You thought all this up really nicely. You always used to say I would go far.. . Together, we've fucked up many of them, huh? You were never one of ours. Who's?! ! SIA, MS A, Police, mafia, politics. .. or your shitty colonel. Let's say I'm now working for a new Agency called ''my own ass''... It's the company where I'm currently getting my pension fund. My own ass and I will make great things. Only, shush ! Don't tell anyone, it's something that my buddies still don't know. Why me? You set yourself up, my friend. I needed a man to clean the slate for me. Someone with a God given gift of a killer. A man that kills first and asks questions later. Now be so kind and give me the tape. I found it under the bed as we were inspecting the crime scene. We won't be needing it any more, will we? Listen, I promised you the man that killed your family. The fourth man is all yours. Take revenge. What about her? -Who? I'll set her free. How can I trust you? You don't have much of a choice. Is everything all right up there, over? Roger, Eagle.. . The suspect is threatening to commit suicide, I'm trying to talk him out of it. Stay in position. -We stay in position, over. Now, don't fail like the last time. Do it right. Kill the monster. I'd like to remember one good thing I did in life. .. Supposedly some time ago.. . I did help.. . I guess I helped someone.. . carried a stove or a fucking fridge up the stairs. That was a good deed, I guess? Carrying things for someone. But I can't remember even that. .. Damn. .. But.. . Sorry. Fool. He really thought he could save your life like that. Now, don't cry. This isn't personal. Eagle, the talks failed. Eliminate both suspects. I repeat, both the man and the woman. They are armed and very dangerous. -Both suspects. Understood. So, you're keeping Milica. It was a fine story - the one about the desperate father, huh? It was my pleasure. Don't worry. I'm taking care of you. Look, madam, we need help. Sure, neighbor. Drop your weapon ! Drop it! On your knees! On your knees! Drop your weapon ! Drop it! The suspect is in front of the building. Major, it's me. Lieutenant Fistric. Do you remember me? Please, surrender. I surrender. Find the girl. Minister! This is such an honor for our institution. Here. Have a cigarette. I can help you get out of here.
