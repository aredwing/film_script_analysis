It's probably just a bad sensor|or something. It's fine. - Well...|- No. I'm just going to go downstairs. I don't think it's anything. No. Maybe we should just stay|in the room until the cops come. Okay, you stay.|You stay, I'll go check it out. No! Fuck that. I'm going to|come with you if you're going. Okay. Stay quiet. Hello? Hello? Who's down there? Who the fuck is down there?

Yeah, we just had the alarm|put in about a month ago. I'm a truck driver,|so I'm gone a lot. That's smart. You two try to get some sleep.|Goodnight. Thanks, officer. Thanks for coming out.

I'm so bad for you. - No.|- Yeah. No. Actually you're great for me. You've always been there. Oh, babe, I can't believe|you moved back into this house. We should've sold it|when dad died.

Happy birthday, babe. - I love you.|- I love you. - Kiss Pete for me.|- I will. I will. Molly... Look, it's probably just|some neighborhood kids. This house has been|vacant for so long. Kids used to hang here|all the time. They'll stop coming|around after a while. Right. I'm going to do a house|to house up here in the morning to give parents a heads up|on what's happening, okay? That usually takes care|of things like this. Okay. You gonna be all right,|Mrs. Reynolds? Did you know my father|before he died? Yeah. Not personally,|but we came out here a few times. I don't remember any of that. Probably a good thing. I just don't understand|why you wouldn't come and stay with me and Peter.|He would love it. Yeah. But you know I can't do that|every single Tim leaves, you know? You know I'd be over|at your house every single week. What do you mean every single week?|Just this one time. Yeah, I know. I just... I'm not sleeping, that's all. - Are you pregnant?|- No. I'm not pregnant. You better tell me if you are. Do you have anymore...|weed that you think you could spot me? - I don't have any.|- What? Frank is out of town. You don't have any more? What the fuck|do you want me to do? You really want to use that|as an excuse to me? Yeah. Especially to you. You know how I feel about this. That's such a bullshit...|That's bullshit excuse. That's a bullshit excuse. Molly, what the fuck|do you want me to do? I don't know.|I want you to forget it. I want you to just|forget it, you know.

We don't have health insurance. I mean, don't worry|about that, babe. We'll just put it on the card,|figure out how to pay for it later. What's going on, Molly? I don't know. I can't remember. Are you using again? - Did Hannah say that?|- I didn't talk to Hannah. Are you using again? I smoked a little pot|on my birthday. That's it. You know you shouldn't be|doing any of that stuff, babe. I know. It was just one joint. You're smarter than that. When are you leaving again? Monday. A short one,|just a couple of days. I'll be back Wednesday. I can cancel if you want. No. Just go. We need the money. Who's alive? What? Yesterday when I found you|in the spare room, you said, "He's alive." Who's he? I think this is going to be|good for us, babe. It's been too long|since we've gone. Yeah. It has. Well, suddenly Tim|comes back into town, and you don't return|my phone calls? Yeah, I know.|I've just been out of it, you know? You okay?|You feeling all right? I mean, Hensley said you|called in sick the other day. Yeah. I just, you know... I've got some stuff to figure out. Well, are you sure? Yeah. All right.|Well, look. I got to go. Yeah, I got to go.|Let's hang out though. I mean, Ryan's got to get Peter. And I love you.|And I miss you. And I just want... It's going to be all right,|Molls, all right? I know.

You don't look so good. Thank you, Ron. Maybe you should go home.|You might be contagious. I need the hours, Ron. Come on. I mean...|I promise I won't cough on anyone. Look, I'm not supposed to let you|work when you're sick, Molly. It's not good for the customers|to see you like this. Come on, Ron. I'll work back here|if you want me to. Seriously? Yeah. Sure. Just stay out of sight, okay? Who's there? Who is it? Molly, Lovely Molly... Something is wrong with me. I'm feeling something. Someone. Someone that couldn't|possibly be here anymore. I... I went through some things, after my dad died. And I saw some things... Some things|that didn't make sense. And no one... No one believed me. I'm going to|show people this time. Show them all of it. You did lay in my arms Molly, lovely Molly I'll return in the spring When the angels And the turtle doves And the nightingale sing No. No. No. Please.|Please. Please. No. No. No. Please, no.|Why? Why? No. No. No! No! Not again! No! Please, no! No! Molly, hold on a minute. Don't punch in. I need to see you in my office. Close the door. Please, Ron,|can you just stop it now? Please. I'm sorry I had|to show you that, Molly. I... I never thought|I'd see that kind of thing from you. I mean, what the hell|were you doing? Molly? Well, fuck, Mr. Hensley.|I don't know what to say. - What?|- I mean, who was that man that's fucking the shit|out of me in the hallway? Wait. Wait! What man? How the hell would I know that,|Mr. Hensley? Please keep your voice down. I mean, one minute|I'm lugging trash down the hallway, and the next minute? Yeah, pulling down my pants|so this man can nail me from behind. I mean, it's a goddamn mystery,|Mr. Hensley! You're completely out of control. - It's a goddamn mystery!|- You're going home. - I have no idea!|- Go home! Okay. I'm coming over.|We're going to talk and figure all this out. You don't have to do that. Oh, I most certainly do. Don't. Molly, I'm not asking. I don't want you to get hurt. Why would I get hurt? Molly, why would I get hurt? Pastor Bobby|is coming over tonight. Tim wants him to talk to me. So, I'm in good hands. You can stay out there|for a few more minutes. Then you have to come in|and help for dinner, okay? Okay! You are a funny man,|Pastor Bobby. Well, that's my gift. Actually, not much of a preacher.|I don't think. Always thought|my future lay in comedy. What do you think? I'd stick to preaching|if I were you. Yeah. I heard that. No, I didn't come here|to get drunk, Molly. When was the last time|you got drunk, Pastor Bobby? I mean, like shit-faced...|Sorry. I mean, like really drunk. Well, I don't think|that's appropriate. Come on, Pastor Bobby. Even Jesus drank a little wine. Well, I was fairly tipsy|at your wedding, you'll recall. Dancing with all the girls. I remember, Pastor Bobby. Yes. But I mean like, stumbling home, passed out on the lawn|kind of drunk. Well, it would have been|a very long time ago, before I was born-again. You miss it? Not really. No. But I thought I was here|to talk about you. Tim's worried about you, Molly. I know. He doesn't want you|to start using again. I'm not. And I'm not going to start. Okay. So what's up? - What's up?|- Yeah. I'm just trying to|deal with something. What? Something that I thought|I was done with in my life. The drugs? No. Is it the death|of your parents? Molly, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know how painful|this is for you. Grief this strong|can recur at any time. And it must be|especially difficult living here in this house|where you grew up together. - I know how hard this is for you.|- He's not dead. What? What did you say? You like my panties? Tim got 'em for me for Christmas. Santa Claus red. - Molly, I'm so sorry...|- No need to apologize, Pastor Bobby. You're still a man, aren't you? I think that I had better be going. Do you miss fucking, Bobby? Molly... I mean, I always wondered|why you weren't married. You're not gay, are you, Bobby? No. I'm not. So do you miss fucking? Do you miss the feeling|of being inside this? Molly, what the fuck? Peter, go to your room! Go. Now.|Shut off the TV and go. What the hell are you on? He's here.|I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Okay. Just calm down. Okay. Calm down. Get the fuck off me!|Get off me. Okay, okay. He follows me. He follows me everywhere. Who, Molly? You know who. You know! Okay. Molly, I want to help you. I am here to help you. But you have to tell me|what is going on. Please. Is it the same as last time, Molly? Molly... Molly... I can't do this again, Hannah. I can't. Don't put me away again, Hannah. Please. Molly! Molly! Fuck... I checked all the vents, the cellar, the attic,|all the rooms. It's just horrible. It was like something died|in the house. I haven't smelled anything. How you been feeling? Okay. You sleeping much? No. Not at all. I really think you should see|Dr. Dean, Molly. Maybe he can give you|something to help you sleep. I'll make an appointment|for you tomorrow, okay? He says everyone|will abandon me again. Molly? I loved you so much. We both loved you so much. You're lying.|Hannah could never do that. Never.
