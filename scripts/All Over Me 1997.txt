Sorry. There's your change. I see that little fuckhead of yours made it. He's got something for me? I put it... No more covering for him! I pu... - Wait! What? Just a second! - No! - Where's my money? - Whoa whoa! Where is it? Ahh! Stop! Wait a second. - Okay, look look... - Shut up! Look, I gave... it was her! Just tell them where you fucking put it! - Watch him. - Tell them where you put it! Please! For fuck's sake! Sorry! Sorry! Where'd you put the fucking envelope! Can you get me out of here, please? The girl from the store, you seen her? Yeah, she ran past me towards the highway. Everything okay? Where did you put the fucking envelope? Alberta, please! Please just tell them! Look, I didn't mean it, okay? Tell them where you fucking put it! Where are you? - All right, listen. - Alberta! So, where are you going? Vancouver. Mind if I ride along? I think that should be okay. Bus 73 leaving for Seattle leaving in 15 minutes. 15 minutes, bus 73 leaving for Seattle at gate 7. Hi. What did you do now? Nothing. Everything's good. I got out, like you did. Got out or ran out? Got out. I wanted to start over. I thought maybe you could help me. This is such a cool place, Celene. Yes, and I like it exactly the way it is, so take a mental picture. Alberta, this arrangement, this two-week arrangement cannot cause me any trouble. I mean zero, understand? - What kind of trouble? - Your kind of trouble. You were always jumping out of one mess into another. - That was a long time ago. - And we're adults now. I'm not your babysitter anymore. I'm not a helpless kid. I promise. So, what's your first move, then? What's your life plan? You don't have one. Life plan, you bet! - Do tell. - I'm gonna do some upgrading. Then... first I'm gonna get a job... no later than tomorrow. Good, because I don't want you loafing around here all day. Uh... Celene? Celene? Relax. I'm not replacing you. You have my permission to leave. Listen, if you're serious about turning your life around, I'm going to hold you to it. Alberta. Hey! I have neighbors, for Christ's sake! Oh, and the phone... you do not answer it ever. Same with the door. Sure. Celene, who was that guy? That's Spencer. He likes to be my slave on Fridays. You hungry? There's some sushi in the fridge. You can crash in the back bedroom. There's a cot. It's bok choi... Thanks. You relax, shitty. Receipt for the yogurt? New girl, right? Coleman? Coaldale. Yeah. Well, here's the thing: over here in civilization, we make a habit of paying for things before we take them. - I wa... - With money. I was going to pay for it. I get my first check tomorrow. Right now all I have is bus fare. Honey, you just became a shoplifter. Wait! I screwed up. I'm sorry. The lady up front said it was okay and that she does it all the time. Thought I was serious? I was just fooling around. Fine, we're fine. We're good here. Is that a Walkman? Uh, here's my tape okay, my thing is dogs. And, uh, other people got their things. - For me it's... well, it's dogs. - Hi. So I'd be down on all fours, I'd be sniffing around... I picked up your dry cleaning and your mail. They were out of red electrical tape. ...you'd lead me around, take me for a walk... Did you forget something? Oh, Jeez, sorry. ...like drag me into the next room, snap that leash again. Gotta keep me in line... You ever play fetch? Maybe got one of those pull ropes. I like those. I like those. I like balls... How do you get them to do what you want? Don't give them a choice. Believe in something strongly enough, even if it's total bullshit, so will everyone around you. ...yank it, hard... - Tighten this, please. ...snap my neck back... It's like being an actor. You have to convince the audience or client that you're in charge. You got that? ...sniffing the grass... - Uh-huh. ...panting... - You gonna get an agent and do some real acting? I know that's what you always wanted. I am doing what I always wanted. I'm in control of my life. It pays well if you're good, and I am. $300 an hour. 18 more months, take my savings, go south. Acting classes, get an agent, execute the life plan. - Sounds pretty thorough. - Better be. Been working on it for over 10 years. ...snap that leash again. Gotta keep me in line. Can't let me wander off... You've been making an effort. Don't think I haven't noticed. I'm a dog, right? How else are you going to get my attention? # Come on, now # # Let me kiss your teeth # # Let me kiss your teeth # # Let me lick your eyes # # Let me kiss your... # You, bark like a dog! Pick that up! Now! I'm going to execute my life plan. # Let me lick your eyes... # Ow! Mmm... # Let me spit in your face # - # Let me spit on your face # - # Fuck you, creep! # Oh, shit. Okay... Look, can you help me out here? I'm only gonna make this worse. Try the orange one. Thanks. Oh my God. I think this is bleach. Spencer, what did I tell you about not hanging up your jacket? Celene? I'm really sorry. I didn't know that was gonna happen. Look, just tell me how much it cost. I'll pay you back. $800, and I need to wear this for an appointment tonight! Don't insult me, acting like you can come up with that scratch for attire. God! It's just one appointment, though, right? Yeah, one that happens to coincide with some very big bills that need to be paid tomorrow. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. I swear. I just... I didn't know your hooker outfits cost so much. What did you just call me? Hooker. I heard hooker. I'm doing what I want, and you have the nerve to call... you wreck my shit and then label me... you've really changed, Alberta... not at all the fuckup I remember. Celene? - What about an advance? - Oh, they don't give advances, dear. You'll be full-time before you know it. Then you can get benefits. I don't need benefits, Penelope. I need money. I need it now. Mmm, dear, what happened? Fall in with the wrong crowd, or stalker? No. Why would l... what about extra shifts with the manager? Les is a cheapskate, honey. And he's a man. He cheats on his wife. - Seriously? - That's what I've been telling people. - Why not just call home? - Absolutely not. Put me on the night cleaning crew. I don't care. Just take it. It'll turn for you. Just give it time. I also like confinement, to be suffocated, not being able to breathe. So ideally, when you're spanking me, you should push my face into your breasts. That'd be nice. That way, even if... person, and I want you to pay attention to detail. ...want anyone to see this tape. I don't like exposing myself. I am the floor to you. Your floor. You can walk all over me like a carpet. You take lighter fluid... Mmm. Oh! Uh, hi. Um, I'm Paul. I'm new in town. Uh, I find this taping thing a bit ridiculous. Uh, sorry. Um, l... I'm not sure how this is supposed to go, but I'd like to try giving up control, for once. Uh, I find this taping thing a bit ridiculous. Uh, sorry. Um, l... I'm not sure how this is supposed to go, but I'd like to try giving up control, for once, if that's okay. Hi, Paul? This is Celene. Uh, we... I can meet your needs. Meet me at the Cedar Lane Mall food court at 7:00. Tonight. I want you to wear white pants. I, uh, command it. Oh, Alberta. It's not what you think, Penelope. There are other ways. Um... hi. I'm Paul. Are you Celene? - No. - Oh. So you... you are. Cool. Wow. Wow? What's that supposed to mean? Oh, wow means good. You look really really good. You're not a freak, are you, Paul? Me? No no, I'm actually disappointingly normal. I mean, I'm not, uh... I'm not, uh... I'm not challenging. You're not a challenge? Heh heh. Um, I'm... I'm easy. Uh, I'm very obedient. Uh, can l... do you want anything? Anything? I'll ask the questions. Okay. I want one of those. My own. Oh, so we're starting? - Now. - Yep. Yep. Here. And... I recall asking for extra chocolate. Yeah, no, I know. You got it. The guy charged me double. Extra. Yep. Stop. Now go. So what does your girlfriend think of you seeking out my services? Oh, no girlfriend. l... I just moved here. - From? - East. - Oh! Lovely place, east. - Yeah. Well, you know, I had a vacation south and I traveled north. - Now you're west. - And now I'm west. West is the best. That is exactly what I'm beginning to figure out. What are you smiling at? Nothing. I don't know. Uh... I didn't expect this to be fun. I actually don't live far from here. Do you think we should go back to my... We're done. I'm... sorry, did l... did I do something wrong? No, you were great. I dominated you. We're done. So pay me. You're the boss. What about... what about another 300? Like, my place? Slightly less of an audience? What are you doing? - Get up! - No. Not till you say yes. Yes. Get up! Yes! Okay. That's me. Oh, don't worry. I'm good for the cash. I just... I hit it big at a casino. I got a great poker face. Hey, if... if you're uncomfortable or something, that's... It's an extra 50 for house calls. Okay. Leave it on. # You don't know what you're doing # # When you turn and act tough # # You don't know what it's like # # To be me when your eyes light up. # So... oh, I'm just gonna... I'll be one second, if that's okay. - Okay. - You can... # You don't know what you're doing # # You can only play hurt so much # # When you call and be all about him # # And I can't hang up... # Here's, uh... Oh! I can... Shouldn't you be down there? On the floor, where you belong? Let's hear you bark, little doggie. Please tell me these are relatively new. Quiet! Dogs don't talk. - Ow! - Oh, I'm sorry. You okay? Okay, we're gonna take you on a walk, little doggie. Is everything okay? - I think I spooked her. - Jesus! Mmm! A real beaut! And she's into kinky shit. - Double happiness. - This is okay, Celene. It's okay. Celene! Beautiful name! Strong. I'm Paul's boss, Rene. No doubt he's mentioned me. So, Paul... I don't think I did a very good job in taking my own advice, drawing that line, business and personal. I shouldn't have accused you and I apologize. Completely unprofessional. - Paul... - Rene. I just apologized for disrespecting you. Don't you think this might be the time for you to apologize... I didn't do anything, Rene! You made me fear for my life! ...for your little duck and hide across the country? I'm gonna go, okay? No. You know what? No no. I think that, uh, Rene should go. You're... you're freaking out my girlfriend... both of us. You're freaking both of us out. You're crawling on the floor wearing a leash, and I'm freaking you out? We need resolution so we can go back to the way things were. What's with the girl? Don't be rude. We're guests. Right. So what are you supposed to be, sweetheart? Domi... dominatrix. Hey, guys... why don't we just leave her out of this, okay? Looks like she's got him on a short... You tell me where it is right now, I order them off you. I think what he's asking, Paul, in a nice way, in a way that I won't, is where the fuck is it? Rene, I did not take your money. I told you then and I'm telling you now, stop being an idiot! You're a dom? We had no idea Paul liked pain so much. Let's get a demonstration. Just leave her out of it! Why can't we leave her out of it? Come on, I did not take your money! Rene! Pull those up. No one needs to see that. - No, it's gonna hurt more... - Pull them up! The club loses half a mil and you dart across the country? You think Rene is that stupid? - Help us out, mistress. - No! Now you're gonna help me! - No! - No! No! Rene. Rene, make him stop! No no no. - No. - Don't! Rene! It's in his closet! - I'm sorry? - It's in his closet. It's in his closet! Thank you. Did that excite you, hmm? Maybe 20 grand here. Rene, that is not... that is not your money, Rene! He won it at the casino. The casino? You, Paul? You have a gambling problem? It's not a problem if you're winning, Aaron, you fucking idiot! You're even stupider than your stupid fucking brother! What, am I confusing you? Am I talking too fast? Did your time in the joint dull your senses, Aaron? Stop! Stop! Don't. Oh my God. Paul. Come on, Paul. Rene, I'm sorry but he wasn't talking. How is he supposed to talk now? I thought that's what you wanted! Stop! Where's the girl? The bag! Come on! Go! Please, fucking please. Come on come on. Start! Go! Get out of the car! Stupid. Stupid girl! Stupid girl! What's your emergency? I'd like to report an assault. Okay, can I have your location? Ma'am? Are you there, ma'am? I'd like to help. I do need to know where you are. I don't know where. Okay, I can send someone to you... - I'm sorry. - Ma'am? I need to find this guy. I need help. Oh, man! Let me guess. You hit a little adversity and suddenly you're what? Back to the jackass in Coaldale? I don't know. Where'd that come from? I got an advance. Doesn't matter. It's for the outfit. What is going on? Alberta... I met this guy, Paul. And I went to his place. And these friends of his, they came over and beat on him badly. And so I ran. I just... I need to know... I need to know if he's okay. How'd you meet this guy? At the food court. Classy. Did he pick you up? Sort of. Can he get a hold of you? Find you? No. No way. Good. You're learning to take precautions like me. Okay? Oh... I have his cell phone number. And? I can call him. And if he's conscious, he can pick up. Forget it. l... I can't. I need to tell the police. Look. You just said you don't know where he lives, so where are you going? I don't know. You're gonna be fine. Believe it, okay? Okay. - Okay? - Okay. It's springtime. You should be out on St. Laurent sipping gin. Not doing a very good job of looking out for your man. The rest of the money's not here. I'm going to go finish this. You two are staying here. And if anything happens to Paul while I'm gone, you're both responsible. - Yeah, but Aaron was... - Both of you. Got something to say to me, Isaac... you worthless fucking Neanderthal? No. Sir. No, sir? Aisle 7, please. Wet cleanup on aisle 7. What? Your nametag. Hey hey! Coleman! I mean, Coaldale! You can't just walk out like that. Wow, you look exhausted. It's understandable, working two jobs. Oh... Penelope mentioned seeing you in some outfit. Hey, no judgment. You gotta do what you gotta do, right? Just tell Penelope I'm sick, okay? If you ever need, like, any protection or a bodyguard for your other work, you know where to find me. God bless. That prosciutto may be a little off. Good hiding, by the way. A real crackerjack. Who would have ever dreamt it'd be under your bed? Aah! It's funny. Paul called you Celene. Smart move, lying to him. I mean, who the hell would want to be dominated by an Alberta? Did you honestly think I wouldn't find you? Tell me where the rest is! My half a million! What? I don't know anything about it. You pay for this place on a grocery store salary? Are you telling me Paul didn't share the wealth with his kinky sweetheart? No, he didn't. Is Paul okay? I'm concerned. Everyone goes through a rebellious stage, but he's making a lot of poor choices lately, lying to me, acting like a dog. One thing I've never had to coach him on much is women. He reminds me of me at his age. I mean, he's been in town, what, a few weeks, if that... - and he's already swooned you. - Ah! Maybe I should call my security detail... - No. Have them come over and teach you... Another outfit of mine you've ruined! Who is this? What are you doing? Hold on a second, Officer. Cash money here. We can settle. # Tell your old friends # # You're gonna leave them # # Our bloodshot eyes wide... # # No need to think when # # This crew gets moving # # Those pins and ball bats # # Heartbeats and head clamps # # And your bad friends... # Top shelf in the spare-room closet. Ankle cuffs. Can you get them please? Need a roll of tape too! Any color's fine! # Fight sense, fight sense. # - So, Alberta. - Uh-huh? Last night, when you told me about the guys beating on your friend and you running away... - Yes? ...you... you forgot to mention the part where you stole 20 grand from them. Yes, I did. Sorry. Coffee? And that you stashed it in my home. Black, thank you. Again, sorry. And that they had a way of finding you, and busting... you're paying for that vase, ass fuck! What I'm saying here is that you didn't exactly tell me everything. You might find it nitpicky, but to me, having prior knowledge of these things would fall under the category of "good to know." I totally agree. And Celene... it won't happen again. You... you said that when you were seven and I caught you eating cat food. So why'd you take the cash anyway? I don't know! It was just a big bag of money. I just... took it! How can you be so calm? Why haven't you kicked the shit out of me like you did him? Oh, there'll be time. Now, anything else... we need to worry about? Your boy toys know where we are? Let me go and I promise they won't hurt you. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, it's you-know-who. I don't care. Listen to me. I need your home. Indefinitely. I'm leaving now. Well, you'd better make other arrangements because I'm coming now and I'm not happy! Pack up. Found a safe house. You got a car? I have Paul's car. You took his money and his car? I had to make a getaway. I'm really starting to enjoy her. - Let's move. - Don't be stupid... Celene. We can deal. So do you want me to pack some overnight clothes? Any good reason why he said my name while looking at you? Maybe he has one of those lazy-eye things. This is how it all started. I pretended to be you. I guess we should call the police now, huh? To report an identity theft? I'm considering it. Think about it. We can get the bad guys sent to jail, and Paul will go to the hospital. We can split the 20,000. Stop talking now. The house was trashed, total, and you're talking about what? Well, won't insurance cover it? It's not my house. It's a client's place. I'm house-sitting for a year, poorly... to save a bit of money. I guess that didn't work out too well for me, huh? I can barely cover my own debts and... fuck! I'll make this up to you, I promise. There's more money. Just don't, okay? I'm serious. The guy in the trunk's convinced that Paul ripped him off and 20,000's only part of half a million. I don't have to explain anything to you. - He's a new client. - Okay, fine, I understand. He's a new client but why did you have to bring him here? This is our private... He's an extreme case and needs extreme confinement. I have... there are people coming over. Sorry. No. I'm putting my foot... Alberta, open that door now. # What's your safety word? # # Empty glass # # Empty glass # # What's your safety word? # # Empty glass # # Empty glass # # What's your safety word? # # Please don't say it # # What's your safety word? # # Please don't say it, what's your safety word? # Do not touch that. You even know what that is? Keys to your truck. Give 'em. If you're lucky, I'll drop you off at a hotel. Rene LeBlanc. Hmm? Local address. Paul's maybe? Celene? Where are you going? I need to know who I'm dealing with. I need this little inconvenience that you brought to my doorstep - to be worth my while. - Celene. Those brothers are crazy. Let's just call the police. Right, and hope they let us keep the cash. Hope that Rene here forgets to mention the forcible confinement. No. Stay put and do not... do not even think about going in that room. Are we clear? Ugh! My hands are burning, so I sweat. Help me up. Please. I have a handkerchief in my pocket. So tell me about this money. It's mine. Paul took it. Handkerchief. You need to know if your employee Paul betrayed you. I need to know if my boyfriend's been lying to me since day one. He was my right-hand protege. Smart like me. Taught him everything about my club: alarm codes, when the safe was at its fullest, and when I confronted him about it, he ran across the country. That son of a bitch. Thank you. Shows what a good heart you have. Don't try and play me, okay? I'm not stupid. Of course you're not. Paul has good taste. You met him and instantly felt unworthy, right? Wanted to seem exotic, tough. You pretended to be your leather-bound roommate. You shouldn't. I hear how she talks to you. Listen. We have a situation here. My security detail, Isaac, has been looking for an excuse to end Paul for a long time now. They can kill that lying prick for all I care. Well. Maybe I misjudged you. You seem very involved in his life. He came to me with nothing. I've guided him. Like a father? So who's this then? Put that away. Your son? I... lost him. He's gone now. I'm sorry. Then untie me. I'll feel better. Forget about the fucking pizza. You show me respect. I just wanna get outta here. I don't give a fuck what you want on your pizza. I wanna go home. Fuck home, okay? We're not at home right now. Fine, you wanna go home to Mommy, little bitch? How can you be so sure those two lunkheads of yours haven't found it already and buggered off? We checked the house. It's clean, and they wouldn't dare. I know my people. Isaac, he's getting worse. He's fine. - No, I can't end up back in jail. - Then don't. - We need to get him to a hospital. - That's not the job. Well, I think the job is sort of over when the target ends up in a coma. I'm even gonna consider letting you go. I need to know the brothers won't come after me once I get my share. Let's just say I have a very strong hold on Isaac. Okay? What does that mean? He's a wanted man. I use my connections to keep him out of jail, and Isaac controls Aaron. So. Didn't do a very good job of controlling Aaron last night. That wasn't my fault. I wanna go, Isaac, okay? I wanna go now. Like you promised, like we planned. We could drive south until it's warm. Rene called like an hour ago, he said... He called? Were you ever gonna tell me? He tracked the leather slut. He's getting the money back. He's probably dropping her into oblivion as we speak. Okay, why don't we take Paul in and we can get the fuck outta here then? Not without word. Okay, fuck Rene's word. Let's just fucking go, okay? I wanna go now. Aaron's not a problem. A couple years back, Isaac got backed into a corner. We worked Aaron into taking the fall. Aaron willingly did two years' hard time. Won't even take a piss unless Isaac gives the okay. Isaac controls Aaron. I control Isaac. Listen here, shithead. Rene tracked Paul across the country. You think if we bail, he'll just forget about us, huh? Especially if his precious little protege over there croaks because of you? We're on the clock here, kid. We stay with this job. Fuck! - I'm gonna tell Mom. - Go ahead, tell Mom. - Guess what? You're fucking adopted. - I am not! I am not adopted! I am not adopted! Fuck you, Isaac. Fuck you. Oh great! Best shirt ever and now look, Isaac. Mom got me this for Christmas. Well, go home and Mom will fix it. - Fine, I will. - Fucking baby. You're close to making a good decision here, Alberta. All you need to do is follow through. For Paul. What in Sam fucking Hill is going on in here? Get rid of her. What is your problem? I don't know what kind of shit he's pulling but, God, stop being so naive. Is Paul okay? Did you see him? He's alive, still in the house playing possum. - What are... - God, I think we can do this. Do what? We scatter the brothers. We get Paulie's ticket to half a million. What is the matter with you? I have it all worked out. The younger brother's completely useless without the older one. so if we get them sep... Celene! Listen. No, you listen. Those two guys are freaking nutbars. They're insane times 20. We can take them. Oh, Alberta. Stop that. I hate it when you use that condescending tone. I'm trying to help here. I don't need your help. I think you do. Now, listen, I just spent a lot of time trying to get that guy to trust me. You got him to talk? Yeah. So I figure if we help Paul, he'll be willing to share his score with his rescuers. Why are you doing all of this? I said I'd make this up to you, and what's wrong with wanting to help Paul a little bit, too? Alberta! I really need to urinate. You have my permission. We were close to a deal. We'd agreed I wasn't stupid. This is ridiculous. Stop it, Alberta. I mean it. Alberta... Isaac will eat you alive. He'll kill you and Paul. You can't do this. Yes I can. Please, Mom, don't. What is it? Isaac, what does that even mean? It means Rene's been scalped. - I've got it. - Give me the phone. Hello? Give me the goddamn phone. Yeah? Hi. Can I speak with Paul, please? Uh... - he's unavailable. Who's this? - Who is it? Oh, so he's still on the floor? You ran off so quickly the other day. Cedar Lane Mall, food court, in a half hour. - Who is it? - How about you come here now? I'm sure it would delight Rene to know that his employees have so little regard for his life. Take Paul's cell and don't be late. Let me say something. I don't think he bought it. He'll show. Dress. Okay, so as we agreed... Act like I'm in control. Got it. No, keep him on the phone. Do not poke the bear. Do not engage. Okay? Okay. See you at Spencer's in an hour. - Can I go with you? - No. - Why? - Come here. Look at me. Someone has to stay here, okay? In case he wakes up. That's gotta be you. Come on, when have I ever steered you wrong, huh? That's right. Good. Okay? Now just trust me, stay here, watch him and don't screw up. - Okay. - Okay. How long are you gonna be? As long as it takes me to snap that bitch's neck. - Okay? - Yeah. All right. Come here, for good luck. Whoa, hey, wait, you can't just walk in here. Look, I'm on call. I only have a few minutes. I told Rene I'd check on your friend so where is he? Okay, um... but Rene's been... when did you talk to him? Last night. What's it matter? I'm here now, so move it. Fine. From what he said, the guy's probably done for by now anyway. Okay, wait. Yeah, it's very important that he wakes up. I'm going to need some clean towels soaked in ice water. All right. Hey. Oh, now. Hey, Paul, are you still with us? Here's your towel. Who were you talking to? Tea towels, imbecile. Tea towels. Oh, okay, I'm sorry. # Oh Lord, Oh Lord # # Oh Lord, Oh Lord... # # Well, I told you # # But I thought you'd knew # # There ain't no heaven # # Oh Lord, there ain't no heaven # # There ain't no heaven # # On the county road # # Don't talk about it... # Yeah? Congratulations. You've completed phase one. Say what? I need you to get back in your car, - start head... - No goddamn way. You're not in control here. Your ass here in five or I'm gone. Wait, you... # Oh Lord # # There ain't no heaven... # Penelope, I really need your help. # There ain't no heaven... # No, this isn't about... # Down at the station... # You were right. I'm in really big trouble. There's this guy. I knew it. # Keep on # # Keep on screaming and crying... # # Oh Lord, I wonder # # What my son has done # # Oh Lord # # There ain't no heaven # # Oh Lord # # There ain't no heaven # # Oh Lord # # Did you bring me any... # Help me! Don't do this. No! Don't do this! He barely has a pulse. He needs a hospital. Listen, this guy expires on you, you're totally fucked. You up for that? Look, I understand what you're saying, lady, - but I can't because my brother... - He's your boss? No, Rene is. If Rene didn't want to help, he wouldn't have called me in a panic, would he? Right? Right? Yeah. Good, let's move already. Okay, which hospital are we gonna go to? Well, I'm gonna go too. You didn't think that Rene would just let Paul slip away like that? He'll be at my hospital under my care. You know, I never did get your name. Is that really fucking important right now? Yes, I think it is. Buddy, you'd better stop this right now. If Rene finds... What the fuck? Well hey. Paul, hey. Nice to see you. Why don't we go back inside? - Hey. - What are you doing? Lady, he's gonna stay with me a little bit longer. Let go. I'm a fucking nurse, you moron. Oh shit. Help him. I'm not afraid of you. No? I'm not afraid. I outsmarted you once before at Paul's. You dined and dashed like some punk kid. What makes you think I can't do it again? 'Cause I said... because I said so, you fucking bitch. So I suggest that you tell me where Rene is ultra-quick - before I get... - You know? Rene's not such a bad guy when you get to know him. He tells me that back east you're a wanted man. And not just from women's rights groups. You know, this act you're pulling... It's not an act. I have your boss, I know where the half million is, I still have the original 20,000, and one phone call from me gets you sent back east for hard time. So next time I'd think twice about hitting a... You know something, slut? I would like an apology for that remark. You can fuck right off. She's way too hot for him. I'm sorry... that you're a slut; That I called you... - a slut. - You're not sorry enough. Not yet. Hey, thanks for... thanks for trying to help me. It wasn't for you, pal. It was for me and my friend... your dominatrix. I'm Celene. You... you're... so she's... Alberta. Alberta. Ow. Is she seeing anyone, you know? Drop the shit, all right? Look, when we get out of here, we want part of the stash that you stole from Rene. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but l... I get it. You lied so that... No, I'm not lying. There's no money. I'm sorry if you feel like you risked a lot or something. Sorry. But... Don't... don't worry. I think Alberta's gonna help us. Oh, man. I'm glad you're not, you know, dead. I was worried about you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You should worry, Aaron. 'Cause if any more shit goes down, Rene will leave you in the dust. I don't know about that. You're the one who ripped him off. God, I did not... Christ. You think Rene's never gotten anything wrong in his life? No no no. Rene is a very smart businessman. All right, he's been there for me whenever I've been sad. Oh yeah, how did he help you when you were in jail, Aaron? Or Isaac? And I was at the club with them, and they were not helping you. They were laughing at you, like, all the time. Aaron, just take him to the hospital. You're free and clear. All right, no more talking between you two. - Aaron, Aaron, I know this is... - No, Paul, shut your mouth. Okay? My brother is my brother and yeah, he's a dick sometimes... most of the time... I know that, but l... he loves me. Okay? And he would never hurt me. So just shut your filthy goddamn mouth. No! Shut up, Paul! Too many people so don't even try anything. Sweetheart, when I decide to try, you'll know. I'm curious, what's someone like you called? Do you have a title or... Are we getting to know each other now? Security expert. Security expert? I do my job, I do it well. I can't control every stupid teenage girl... Oh, so it's everybody else's fault? Shut up. I practically run Rene's business. He'd be lost without me. Without Paul, you mean. Let me tell you something: We'll all be a lot better off when that guy's gone. Who knows? That may have happened already. Can I have another cashier at checkout? Another cashier... Tell me something. Why hasn't Rene ever suspected you and Aaron? I mean, if you know everything, like when the safe is at its fullest, all the security and alarm codes, why couldn't you have taken the money and fingered Paul... Look down. We're leaving. Come on. Excuse me, sir? Would you mind turning around, please? You gotta be fucking kidding me. This doesn't concern you, okay? I think you should let go of her. Why don't you give me some distance so I can take care of this bitch, okay, porkpie? Let her go, sir. Gun! Oh my God! Get down! Call the police! Motherfuckers! - Hold him! Get the gun away. - Fuck you! Don't you dare, don't you dare! Fuckin' kill... I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, bitch. Make sure you tell the cops he's a wanted man. Fuckin' kill you, bitch! You... Thanks, Penelope! Where's the money? Where's the money? Come on, get your head down. Crap. Celene, you're not gonna believe what happened. Celene? Spencer? What the hell happened? I didn't mean to scare the guy. Yeah, frighten him a little. I was just playing around. Bald guy, bald guy. - He's crazy. - Where's Celene? I've never seen a submissive so terrified of male nudity in all my life. He kept calling me... a freak. I'm a freak? Everything was fine until you came along. You've wrecked everything. Hey, where are you going? Look, wait a minute. I have to do something. He might hurt Celene. Wait. Look, stay here and don't... Spencer! You do as I say and you get in the car. Celene needs our help. Come on, Isaac. Pick up the phone. Isaac. Rene. Wow, you... uh, you okay? Hey, look, we found your hair. Here. - Paul awake? - Yeah yeah. Hey, did Isaac get you back? Bring him out. You really should have stayed out of this, Officer. Do you even know where this guy lives? - Stop yelling! - You stop yelling. - There it is! - Watch where you're going. Hey! Spencer. Come on, let's go. Spencer? Looks like I may have crossed that line again. Sorry about that. See, if you're clinging to the faint hope that because we're so close, I won't hurt you... I won't kill you for the money. But I will kill you for the lies. Ah! Please... Rene, what if I told you the thing you want to hear? Huh, what happens then? Well... we head back home, get you back working at the club under strict supervision. Why would you even want me to come back and work with you? You think I stole from you. Clearly a cry for help. We're not friends, Rene. We're not anything. I was your employee, I'm not your son. Now, Paul... - Are we friends? - No no. He doesn't have your money! Where's Isaac? Alberta, run. I mean it, now! Isaac, where are you? I know where your money is. All of it. Just let my friends go and it's yours. Where are you? - Isaac? - He has to say it. The truth! Now! No, wait! Isaac... hey, Rene, that girl... Rene, can I talk to you for a second? - Aaron, help me. Grab her. - Yeah. I am done messing around, Paul. Let her go! - Rene? - For the love of God, Rene, I didn't take it. What do you want? Truth! Friendship. Right fucking now or I'll drain her right here. Rene, there is a naked guy outside. Naked. What do you want me to do? You didn't think we're finished, did you? Hey, that's far enough. No! Get that thing away from me. - Aaron! - No way. Spencer, this isn't role-play. He's gonna stab you for real. Everything's fine. This one's a hitter, not a jabber, aren't you? - Did you make the call? - I did! Police are on their way. - Cops, what? No way. - Aaron, she's bluffing. Big burly men with giant batons... Jesus! - Where the fuck did you get these? - From Isaac. - I didn't think he'd need them in jail. - What do you mean, jail? - Like jail jail? - He pulled a gun on me in public and the cops swarmed. They took him away right after... - Right after what? - Right after I figured out that Isaac's the one that ripped off Rene. Huh? Oh boy. Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, hi. Uh, what... uh, what she said... - Is the truth. - Don't He didn't think that anybody but Paul was smart enough to pull it off. - Is that true? - She's trying to turn you against me. - Yeah. - Then where's your brother now, huh? - Where's your protector? - Aaron. - Aaron, look at me! - What? I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation. Yeah? Well, like, what if Paul didn't take the money, huh? Thank you. Huh? I mean, what am I supposed to think? My brother's gone, you're bald, - we got a naked freak walking around! - I am not a freak! Ah! Isaac did this, didn't he? I know it, you know it... the nurse probably even figured it out. Isn't it possible that Paul's not to blame? Fuck! Fuck, Rene! Sorry, Paul. How do I get you out of there? Move away! I'll decide when or if Paul gets untied, not you! Aaron! When is this gonna stop, huh? When are you gonna fight back? - You shut your mouth! - Paul could have died for his mistake! - Just shut your fuck... - Aah! Stop! Paul's okay. You can still be free. The cops are coming. - Aaron, stop. - No no! Think about yourself! Please stop. Hey, bro. How you doing? Can't come to the phone? That's cool. Voicemail all right. Not too fucking good in jail, is it? Aaron, you gotta go. Cops are gonna be here any minute. Look at me. Go. Okay? I'm okay. Okay... Paul? Isaac... let... Isaac set me up. It's no wonder your son wants nothing to do with you. Yeah... can you believe he got sick of being under his dad's thumb? Go figure! I did it... I'm sorry. You're pathetic! Never called the cops, did you? Bluff. It was all Alberta's idea. What can I say? You can say you have some clothes nearby. Please? I believed you were a thief. I'm sorry. You're amazing. Do you... do you have plans this weekend? You should see a doctor. Spence, drive him to the hospital. Your truck's around the corner. Spencer... - Seriously, Friday? - Maybe. Oh, come on! I need a yes. All right. Okay. - Yeah? - Yes already. - Okay. - Yes. You gotta take that thing off before we go to the hospital. Trust me on this. No way! So, I couldn't help notice you mentioning something about knowing where the money is. It was in his car? You have it! It was in Isaac's car! Crap! I'll make this up to you. I promise! Your house, the kitchen table and... the living room table. Paintings, business, life plan. Is this you trying to make me feel better? Just let it go, please. You know... you coming back for me, that was really... - Stupid. ...brave. Well, a promise is a promise. Stop, okay? We're safe. That's what's... important. Where did you... Whoo-hoo! I was kinda short on time, but I grabbed what I could. Hope it'll help. Lattes. $7.50 please. I got this. Yeah, I'm definitely enjoying you.
