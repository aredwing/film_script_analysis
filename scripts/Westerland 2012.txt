I've still got your bag. - Keep it for me. Well, fine... I'd better go inside. I'm meeting friends later at my place. Yeah... Have fun. This one needs one, too. - This one? Yes, please. Well. - That one is okay. Yes. I guess that's the lot. Let's knock off. Sort of like... Rupert, come on! Well, then I'll go ahead. Great song. What does it mean? I drank raki... Raki? Oh, right. - ... I drank wine, and I partied. Like it! - Yes. What do you do? My mother thinks I'm at drama college. But I'm not. She'll find out sooner or later. Yes. I'm scared about that. And what do you want to do? Don't know yet. And you? I like what I do. Shovelling rubbish? I'm doing a school- leaving certificate in the evenings. Then I want to study landscape design as a correspondence course. Landscape design, yeah? Yes. It would suit you. The mess doesn't bother me. Yes, but you don't live here. Want to get us something to eat? If you're paying. I'm broke. You still have 20 euros. - I do? Didn't you borrow them this morning? - I've no idea what you mean. What should I get you? Shall we watch a film? What film? - You know Roland Klick's "Supermarket"? - Legenda no traduzida - Never heard of it. You don't know "Supermarket"? So what if I don't? You want that? No, help yourself. Sure? - Yes. Do you always turn the sound off? What's with the weird colours? I've no idea what you mean. The colours are weird. Yes... It's a 70s film. Maybe that's why. Can we watch something else? You work nights or what? No. You can come up with me. I was just returning your things. what things? The ones harmed. What did you borrow? - Things I'm wearing. You can keep them. Really? - Yes. I'm off to bed. - Okay. You can stay over if you want. - I have to go home. Okay. Whatever you say. Okay, then I'm coming along. What are you drinking, Jesus? Coke. The table's set. I'll go ahead, then. Yes, help yourselves. Is Jesus your real name? Yes! It was a real cross to me as a child. And the job creation scheme made me study carpentry. It was all they had on offer. But I'd rather be an actor or a stuntman an. Tuncay used to act. - Dearest... Do you know "The Robbers"? - Who? You do know Schiller? - Know who? Tell him to do some reading, Cem! Tuncay was cast as Schufterle, the youngest and least competent robber. - Legenda no traduzida - When his line finally came up, he got a fit of the giggles on stage. Embarrassing! - It was funny. Do you know, Schufterle, how many lives have been lost? Eighty- three, they say. The powder- magazine alone blew 60 to smithereens. As I chanced to pass by a dwelling, I heard a great clamour within. I looked in and what did I see by the light within? A child. Fresh and ruddy it was. It was lying on the oor under a table. Poor little wretch! said I, you'll catch your death, and threw it into the ames! Take a seat. Go on, take a seat. A child. Fresh and ruddy it was. It was lying on the oor... under a table. Nice evening. Where's the blow- up mattress? - It's punctured. No problem, I'll take the oor. I think I drank too much. - Yeah? You have to chuck? We'll see. Don't you have work? Weekend! - Weekend? What do you want to do? - I've no idea. You bit me, look at my hand! You've torn it to shreds. I'll kill you, you witch! I'll kill you! Halim, Halim, Halim. Please, please. Don't do it! Take the knife away. Why are you doing that? Because I'm nauseous. I don't believe you. Don't touch me! Not being fat is definitely advantageous. But you aren't fat. I'm not? You're not, no. Pay attention, I'll start over. Our memories still hold tight All we loved from childhood on Our village, where we attended school, Our high- lying fields, meadows, cliff- side paths, Each way... we ran along, Each route leading through the meadow And here it comes: The dolmens where we burnt our bonfires Everything is as it should be. Now you're up. Our... memories... still hold tight Come on. It's kind of eerie. It looks nice, but it's kind of eerie. Are you guys hungry? Let me have a try! No,just some of that. I just want a try. Anyone? Try it. Doesn't taste bad. Cem? - No, thanks. You sure? And you? Are you afraid of Aegir? I've no idea who you mean. You don't know Aegir? - So what if I don't? Aegir is a sea giant. He hunts all who go out to sea, makes ships capsize, and eats the whole crew. But you want to sail anyway? Sure. Shall we watch a film? What do you want to watch? I like what you like. How about a silent film? Well, feeling better now? Yes. I'm feeling great. Where is it, where's your fat? Where's your fat? - Quit it! Fine, no problem... but where's your fat? Where? There! Where? Show me. Well? Where's your fat? You're all bone. All bone. Where? Can you tell me? Don't squash, chop! I am. I'll show you. Okay? In the bowl. Sorry? - The onions go in the bowl. And now? - Tomatoes. How? - Dice them. Know what I don't get? What? I think you're putting me on. - I don't follow you. - Legenda no traduzida - No? I hate it when people take the piss. Shit. What's your problem? - I didn't mean to, honest. Tania! Why my brother has anything to do with you... Tania! Hold this. Coming boozing? No. You're not your self. Hey, Jesus. Stoned again, yeah? Hello, Erol. I'm splitting. No need. Your brother's really terrifying. He almost chopped my finger off. I swear it. You're stoned. - No, I'm not. Why are you lying? - I'm not. Just admit it. - what? I can't stand it when you're stoned. I'm not! Do you visit the mainland much? Why bother? This is my home. You can't do landscape design if this is all you know. - Legenda no traduzida - Maybe we'll go over together some time. Tuncay? Yes. - 200 euros are missing. Did you take them? - Why would I? Morning. - Hello. - Morning. - Legenda no traduzida - Jesus! Tania, help him. What's on the menu? Spaghetti. Here. Hey, Jesus. - Hey. You well? - Fine, I love the job. Don't you like the job? I like it fine. - You sure? Here, Tuncay. Been near the till, Jesus? - Tuncay! - Legenda no traduzida - No, why? - 200 euros are missing. I probably just miscounted. - Not by 200 euros. You've no proof. - Keep out of it! But I didn't do it! Will you let him be? I don't want him working here. That's it. We could sort this out. - I already have. But I didn't do it! You're such an asshole. - Watch it! - Cem, please. - Legenda no traduzida - Hold it. I tried to cut your name into my skin. You scare me. - Don't worry. I'll look after you. Look after yourself. What's this then? Food. Sorry but it's inedible. - What's that? Eat what's on your plate! It's not fair, you're stronger. Can you see it yet? - See what? Hello? - Cem, it's me. What's up, Erol? - What's wrong, mate? I'm ill. - So what, open up. No, I feel shit, I sleep all day. - I don't believe you. I'll call you. Training's over? Hey, Cem. Will you let me in? I don't know... Oh, yeah, sure. Come in. Don't worry, I won't stay long. I just wanted to see how you're doing. Hello Jesus. - Hello. Want some tea? I can get it myself and you can go back to bed. Don't worry, I've got it. Did Cem infect you, too? You seem to be feeling better. Yes. Sit down, throw the things on the oor. School's started again, right? Yes. I hope you don't miss too much. Is someone helping you keep up? It's fine... Jesus, get up now. Why? Leave him be. - I don't like it. You're not sick, right? No. You won't tell? Hey, do you have a bit of grass? Don't give him any. I don't have any. Doesn't matter. I'm in training. He's doing push- ups and sit- ups. All fighters do. I can teach you taekwondo. Is it an offensive weapon? - Depends on you. I certainly need an offensive weapon. I'm off again. You can stay. - No. I just wanted to see if you two need help. Take care. Let me know... about the taekwondo. - Sure. You shouldn't lie to Rupert. Yes, I know. We're doing an outing this weekend. You two should join us. We'll see. Do me the favour. It's time you made up with Tuncay. - Legenda no traduzida - Promise? I promise. Will you ask Erol, too? - Yes. Good. Take care. What? How did the other one go? You mean "seni seviyorum"? Right. How was it again? - Seni seviyorum. And the other one? Cem! You all right? And Jesus? We're doing fine. - Honest? About what I said, I... What? You know. - what do I know? I'm apologising to you both. No trouble. You don't hold it against me? It's fine. Jesus can work with us again if he likes. No, it's all right. I mean it, it'd be fine. Yeah, I heard you. Nice cup of coffee. Here. Warm up ab. With a nice shot. Tania. Nice and hot. Help yourself. Who made them? I made them, enjoy. Then they're bound to be bad. - Erol! How's your friend? Fine. He has a problem with food. Amongst other things. I don't know what you mean. You don't want to talk about him? - No. Cem, I can't cover you for missing so much work. You're risking everything you moron. Jesus, look, we live in a dump. - Clean the shit up if it bugs you. You can help. You know it's against the rules. It's great to break rules together. Why don't you trust me? I do trust you. No, you don't. Yes I do. Will you give me a blowback? What did you dream? Tell me. You were swimming in the sea. How could I have been? Let's go, Jesus! Don't watch me. Are you a believer? I like the rituals. Yes... I mean, do you believe in anything that's above all else? I don't know. I don't think so. What's wrong? Nothing. Tell me what's wrong. I thought you believed in us. I thought you meant, you know, religion or... It won't work out if only one of us believes. Where are you going? I have to shop. I have to visit Tuncay and help him out. I'll hurry, don't worry. THOU SHALL NOT SMOKE DOPE! THOU SHALL NOT PUKE! THOU SHALL NOT LIE! Well? What's new in the realm of darkness? What are you on about? Can't party no more? Is partying all you have in your mind? Sorry, I didn't mean it. No trouble, mate. You're allowed out tonight? Open the door! Open the door, damn it! Jesus, open the door! Why do you lock the door? You weren't here. I cooked us something. The bathroom looks great. It can be cleaned up. THOU SHALL NOT DIE! The knife! - Chill out. I'll do that for you, okay? Give me the knife. What are you scared of? Well? - I'm not scared. Know what? What? You think you're my saviour or what?
