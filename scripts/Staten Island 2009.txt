News-channel weather reports often exclude Staten Island when delivering the city forecast. In 1988, New York's Board of Trustees forgot to allocate any funds to Staten Island in its annual budget. Why do people feel this way? Perhaps it's because Staten Island happens to be located in the same city as a place many consider to be the center of the entire world. Yes, I'm talking about Manhattan. Is Staten Island drowning in the wake of its famous neighbor? Perhaps, but this is a grand mistake. Staten Island is a unique, misunderstood land, and it should not be treated as the forgotten stepchild of Manhattan any longer. Occupied by the Unami Indian tribe for hundreds of years, Staten Island was bought by the English in 167 O and has since grown into a land of great ethnic and financial diversity, where doctors, stockbrokers, and lawyers reside right next to cops, firemen, and sanitation men. And in the middle of all this... the largest population of mobsters in all five boroughs. That's right, Staten Island is the most popular home for mobsters in New York City, and the grand Staten Island forests also happen to be the choice body-dumping ground for mobsters from the Tri-State Area. The Island's a virtual body farm with apropos street and town names such as Great Kills, Arthur Kill, Fresh Kills, and Kill Van Kull. But it's the people here who truly make this land very special indeed. There's something very different about these forsaken islanders. But enough talk. Let's go see what this forgotten place and its unique people are all about. Bon voyage! You know... ...most people, they think that we've chosen this life because there are no rules, but in our world, there are rules. "Don't rat on your associates. " "Don't get high on your own supply. " "Don't pi... " "Don't piss in someone else's pond. " They're cute clichs that we've heard a million times. Well... They lend... ...an order to our disorder. Oh, yeah... I forgot one... "Do not fuck with someone else's family. " See, that... ...that's our cardinal rule, and you and your pals, you broke it. You broke into my home. You put a... You put a hole in my mother. You cocksucker! That's my mother! You talk now! You talk right now! Or I will fucking pull your intestines out and strangle you, you... Um... I got something I gotta do. Now, Parmie? Can't be avoided. When I get back... ...we'll wrap it up. I'm not done with him yet. Evening, Bill. Tonight's the night, Mr. Tarzo. Let's go make history. He's doing very well. That's great! That was great! That's your best ever. Come on, come on! You've never come close to seven minutes. That was unbelievable. That's better than you've ever done. Breathe! Breathe! Good job! I'm two minutes short of my time. Parmie, I do not understand what you are trying to accomplish here. Ugh! I thought that the breathing exercises would help me more. - They did help you. - I'm very disappointed. - I gotta go again. - No, no, no, no. Your lungs are not ready for another go... you gotta give it a rest. I'm ready. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to do this. My name is Parmetto Tarzo. I live in Staten Island, New York. I will attempt to hold my breath for nine minutes under water, breaking the world record, which is now... ...being held by Thomas Sietas of Germany. I'm ready to do this. Come on. That's enough! That's enough! You gotta stop! You gotta stop! You're not ready for this. This is too much! Only two more months, Jas. We're getting close! And when he's born, I'm gonna bring him in here, and you can finally meet 'em both. Cure cancer. My boy is going to cure cancer. Excuse me. Are you done? Um... 'Cause we've got some business here. Okay. Thanks, Jas. Hey! Get some coffee, some bagels, and meet G in the back. You got work to do. You're all right, Parmie? What happened last night after you left us? Get some coffee... black. Hi, Ma! How are you feeling? No, last night, you know... It... No, it... I know... Don't... No, no. No that... Don't mention it. Not... But I do have some good news. We finally found one of the guys who hurt you. I'll bring you lunch. Huh? Go for a walk in the park. All right. We've checked half the septic-cleaning companies on the island and still can't find an Eddy anywhere. Maybe the bastard was lying. After what Parmie did to him, I don't believe he was. All right. What else? Nothing? Anything? Good, 'cause... There's something... ...something important that I'd like to discuss with you, gentlemen. Come on. Come on! Ah! - Ah! - Ah! We have worked for ten hard years, and I've done the math, and... ...we finally have the financial security, the manpower, and the political connections to make a substantial move. What are you talkin' about, Boss? I want to take control of Staten Island. I wanna take the whole thing. Run the show. I don't wanna give anything any longer to any other crews. I want it all. Everything. Parmie, you're not serious, are you? Why wouldn't I be, F? Because we're a small crew running a small part of the island. We don't have the means. We don't have the power. This crew is meant to be something bigger. Yeah, but not that big, Parmie. F is right. What you're proposing has never been done before. One crew run this whole island? Nobody's ever had the balls to try something like this. It's fucking crazy if you ask me. Sounds like my mother. Gotti, Capone, Castellano. They all started this way. I've studied them. They were all in the same position that we are now when they made their moves. Yeah, but, Parmie, why take the chance? We're making a shitload of money. Are you with me or not? Yeah! Of course we are fucking with you. - Come on. - We're with you. - We're with you. - Yeah. Excellent. That's right. It's exciting times. I... I'm so happy that you haven't disappointed me. This thing will start immediately. The process will take about a year. Things are gonna get really bloody around here. It sounds like we're gonna start a war unlike this city has ever seen. When it's over, the island will be ours, and we will make history. # Let me call you Sweetheart # # I'm n love wth you # # Let me hear you whsper that you love me, too # # Keep the love Ight burnng n your eyes so true # # Let me call you Sweetheart # # I'm n love wth you # This is the most beautiful part of my day. I hate when it ends, Ma. Oh! Ow! What's the matter? This has been hurting me all day. Maybe I go lay down. Oh, okay. Let me help you up. Oh! Me dspace... Come on, Ma. Here you go. Put your arm around me. Here you go. Oh, I am so embarrassed that you have to do all these things for me. It's what a son does, Ma. Enjoy the ride. There you go, Ma. There you are. Watch your feet. I won't rest until I find the men that did this to you, Ma. Let me put some lotion on you. It will help. Ha! Oh! Okay. You are in a very good mood lately. I think maybe you are up to something again. I knew it. What is it this time? I found something that I can truly achieve. Not like the other things that I tried to do. This was right in front of me the whole time. I just didn't see it. But if I can do this thing, Ma, it will be big. I will never understand you, my son. I gotta go to work, Ma. Okay? I love you. Good night, okay? - Good night, my son. - Good night, Ma. Yes? Boss, we have a problem. Your plan, your bg plan? I got a call from a frend of mne who knows the Russans from the dark sde of the sland. They know about everythng that we're dong. They know everythng, Parme. Word was probably leaked from the muscle that we hired to facilitate our power move. Exposure is inevitable. I just didn't think it would come so soon. All right. All right. Get everybody together. I'm on my way. We'll figure out how to handle this. Parme, Parme, be careful. Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine. They won't move on me so quickly, you know. We're gonna work this out, F. Nobody's gonna get in the way of what I want. Okay? Nobody. Motherfucker! Ah! Oh! Oh! Motherfucker! The blood of the Natve Amercans s on all of our hands! People will pay attention. I will save this ancient land, you fuckers! Okay. Okay, okay, okay. All right. I'm coming down. Save our trees! Save our trees! Save our trees! Save our trees! Save our trees! Excuse me. Hello. I have been in an accident. Can you help me? Hey, buddy, you're getting out or what? Here it is. The biggest fucker of the batch. That's where we start. Let's go. Now, what's this? What are you doing? Those are mine, gentlemen. What the hell you doing up there? You don't look like one of those protesters. Get your ass down here! I'm not going anywhere, gentlemen. - I start cutting, you'll get down. - Yeah. - We got a job to do! - Yeah! Knock it off! - I climb up there, I cut you in half! - And I'll help! Who the hell you think you are? My name is Parmetto Tarzo. Who the fuck is Parmetto Tarzo? Exactly. My name is Parmetto Tarzo, and I'm not coming down until I complete my task. Mr. Tarzo! We need to know what the hell you're doing. Nicholas, are you ready for me? Trs belle lumre, Mr. Tarzo. I'm ready when you are. Good, good. You can answer some questions now? With all due respect, Mr. Tarzo, you need to come down from there. You're trespassing. Who are you? We bought this land, and the cops here told us who you are, and we mean no disrespect at all, but we're about to start construction, and we can't do anything if you're still up there. Well, then, you have a problem. Mr. Tarzo, you still haven't answered the question. What is your task here? I am tree-sitting in protest of the destruction of this forest, and I will remain up here until something is done. Why the hell do you even care? - You're a fucking gangster! - Whoa! Wait! Holy shit! It's him! Fuck me sideways! Parmie! Parmie, the cops called us to talk you down. What in God's name are you doing up there? He's trying to save the forest. Hey, I've known you 15 years. You've never mentioned the forest or anything to do with nature. Not once. What the fuck are you doing up there? Okay. Here's the deal from my captain. We can't force him down. He may have a weapon. If we can't talk him down, we're to issue a closure order on the whole forest. No destruction, no construction. No one but cops allowed entry. Un-fucking-believable! I'm losing an arm and a leg here, Mr. Tarzo! Can you guys help me out here? Take it easy. Parmie! Parmie, we don't hear from you for three weeks. Now you're perched in a very tall elm tree, and you're trying to save some forest land. Have you gone insane, my friend? Oh, my God, no! Do mo! Do mo! Do mo, Parmie! Oh, Jesus. Do mo, Parmie! Parmie! What in God's name are you doing? Why did you bring her here, Officer? To talk you down, Mr. Tarzo. Que cosa fa? Que cosa fa? Scend! - Mama, go home. - Scend! Cosa fa? She's falling apart, Mr. Tarzo. For Christ's sake! Just come on down. Everybody, just shut the fuck up! I want everybody to leave, so me and my mom can be alone. Mommy, you need to calm down, okay? You need to go home. I am not going anywhere until you tell me how you ended up up there. Ma... Do you remember when I told you that I had a new plan? Yes. Yeah? Well, because of that plan... ...my men, they... ...they tried to kill me, but I survived. I went home... ...and I kept it from you, Ma. But I fell into a state of despair. And all my dreams were destroyed, Mama. So I decided that I would take my own life. But moments before I ended my existence, my eyes, they fell on a headline in a newspaper, and this sparked a memory inside my head of a man sitting in a tree. And this man... ...he was trying to save this... ...very land, but they intimidated him. And they got him to come down. Look, I can save this ancient land, Ma. Ah! And that would be something. People would know your name. Everything you've always wanted. That's right. Who knows me better than you, Ma? I always knew that this desire would get you into trouble. If you just found love, Parmie. L'amore. If one person you love knows your name, this is enough. Ma, you gotta forget about this love thing. How can you say such a thing? Oh... My last days on this Earth are very sad, Parmie. I should never have left Italy for this godforsaken island! Help! Jesus! Motherfucker! What the fuck? Gesu Chrsto! Oh! There's... I... I love you, Mama. I love you, my son. You broke my heart. What? Hey... You're not coming down, huh, Mr. Tarzo? No. Why don't you stay here, and we'll post some guys around the edges of the forest. But you know what? Make sure nobody says anything to anybody about this. All right, Mrs. Tarzo, we'll take you home, okay? Okay. Hey, give me a hand real quick? You take care of my mother. I love you, Ma. Which one of us will die first? It overwhelms me. I want it to be me. What are you talking about? This is supposed to be a happy occasion, all right? Yeah? Did you read the manual? Yes. Hey, careful. Cheers! Cheers! Let's have a baby. Really? Are you ready? I think I am. I used to think, why mess up this perfect thing between us by bringing someone else into it? And now it seems right. Like the baby will be us. You know, not separate, but an extension. What's wrong? Nothing. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes, I'm sure. I want to do it right now. - Yes, yes, yes! - You do? Albert Ensten's Annus MrabIs, hs year of mracles. Whle he was just workng as a clerk n a patent offce, Ensten had four papers publshed n a leadng German physcs journal. These papers would transform the way we see the unverse. Hi! - Hey. How're you doin'? - Hey. - Mmm... - Mmm! Oh, no, no! I took two showers! It's not strong. Just one more. I'm sorry. No, it's not your fault. Where have you been? I worried about you. I went to the doctor after work. Is everything all right? It's been four months, and I haven't gotten pregnant, so I just wanted to see if everything was in working order. And what did they say? FEMALE VOICE-O VER: Tssue engneerng allows for the successful regeneraton of everythng from skn for burn vctms to ears and noses for people who have lost or dsfgured body parts. Breakthroughs n tssue regeneraton are occurrng here n Staten Island's medcal-research facIty. Nanotechnology s a procedure whch uses computers and sensors smaller than a cell to study the human body. Breakthroughs n nanotechnology are occurrng here n Staten Island. Let's talk about the Staten Island Research Center's newest project... embryonc gene modfcaton. Breakthroughs n ths area are allowng our doctors to enhance desrable characterstcs n an embryo whle deletng undesrable characterstcs, resultng n chIdren who are smarter, stronger, healther, - and capable of great thngs. - Sully. - Sully! - Yeah? I'm done with the exam. The doctor wants to speak with us now. Yeah, yeah. Mrs. Halverson, you have what's called a retroverted uterus. Your uterus is facing backwards instead of forwards. This sounds bad. Don't be alarmed. Your doctor was correct in sending you to me, but it's not as serious as it sounds. It's just a hard condition to detect. One simple way you can compensate for this is to alter position during intercourse. This will help impregnation. So I don't gotta have an operation? No. We're very far from that. Nah... The nurse outside will give you an information packet that will explain what you should do at this time. And any questions, just call the office. Thank you so much, Doctor. I'm so relieved. You're going to be fine. - Come on, Sully. - All right. You... Um... One thing, though... Um... Do... On the TVs out there, they had this... um... They show where they have an operation where they make the babies real smart. Is that for real, or is that, like, science fiction? I mean, what...? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's quite real, Mr. Halverson. It's, um, an ad for research done at this facility. It's called embryonic gene modification, a procedure where we genetically alter an embryo to create superior, healthier children. It's... It's amazing. Well, thank you, Doctor. - You're welcome. - Good luck with your program. - We really... - Okay. - Thanks, Doctor. - You're welcome anytime. This is amazing shit you got going with them kids. And good luck. Go see the nurse. Ow! Mm-hmm. That's better. Thanks. Okay. So, I have to throw my legs back like this and then thrust my pelvis skyward. All this high-tech shit, and their answer is for us to fuck like circus folk, huh? I don't get it. It'll help the sperm get to the right spot. Uh-huh. Come on. Uh-huh. That's sexy. You try, and see how sexy you look. - All right, all right. - Come on. Do your thing. Oh, shit! I still have some dirt here. It's an old stain. Don't worry. Hey, hey, please, just... Hurry, I'm dying here. I just... I, um... I... I went... I went... I w... I went to that medical center today. - What? - Yeah. You kidding? Why? I was curious about, you know, all that genetic shit. I mean, smart kids are fucking amazing. You know? So I... I spoke to our doctor. You know what? Shit. I'm sorry. This dirt is really bothering me. - Sully, just forget it! - I swear to Christ. You went back to the doctor? - That's weird. - Yeah. She explained how it works to me, you know. They enhance the smart genes and they "dehance" the... the... ...the dumb ones. You know, I mean... These kids, I mean, they are like geniuses and shit. They can do miracle shit. Yeah, that's great. Can you come back in here, please? She said it costs $50, OOO to get into the program. I mean, you gotta pay, 'cause it's kinda like... ...um, artificial in... ins... Insemination? L... i... ins... i... It's just like that, you know, so it costs a shitload of money. Let me ask you something. If we had that kind of money, would you be into that? I don't know, Sully. Yo, Eddie! - Can I talk to you for a second? - What's up? Let me ask you something. You've been around, right? - I fucked a lot of broads. - No, I'm not talking about that. I'm saying, like, uh... If you wanted to... uh... ...if you wanted to steal something, like, rob somebody, would you know who to call? Yeah, dude. I'd fucking call Johnny Nutsack and Vinny DaCheese. I'm not... Stop. I'm serious. I'm dead fuckin' serious. I've seen it open. We did this place about eight months ago. There was a blockage in the pit, so I had to flush all the toilets. An old woman let me in, let me wander around by myself. I passed his office, he didn't see me, and it was open. Just piles of fucking cash. So I've been watching the place. And they have an alarm, but they only, uh... What do you call it, when you turn it on? "Turn it on"? No, with an alarm. You... you... "Engage"? Yeah, you engage it, yeah. Anyway... They only do that when he and his mom both go out. So, the only problem that I can see is the old woman and the safe. Safe's not a problem anymore. Yeah? Safe's not a problem. No. He will handle the safe. And we'll handle the old woman. But you have to understand, we all have to understand the risk involved. We're not stealing from some average, fucking Joe. Yeah, I know, you said that about, I don't know, ten hundred billion times. - So I think I get the idea. - But... Parmie Tarzo, right, did not make his money on Wall Street, okay? So you have to be absolutely fucking positive that this is what you wanna do. Is this what you wanna do? Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Shhh! Oh! Hey... tsk... tsk... Eddie, watch her! If she wakes up, tape her mouth. Sully, show me the safe. Yeah, it's, it's right up here. See what that was. Uh... We better leave. Let's... Let's leave. Without this fucking money, we're not. Okay. Okay. I'll get out of here... What did you do? Calm the fuck down, Sully. Listen to me. Listen to me. - Eddie, what the fuck did you do? - Sully, calm the fuck down! No, listen. She woke up, and I went to tape her mouth. I tried to tie her up, but she freaked out, so I tried to... You're not supposed to shoot! What was I supposed to... Call an ambulance! No, no! You're fucking crazy, Sully! Call an ambulance! No! We can't call an ambulance! We gotta get the fuck outta here! Oh, God! I'm sorry! I was... I... Here... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know, I know. I know, I know. I got it. Let's go! And she's gonna die? - Come on, Sully! Let's go! - She's gonna die! Let's go! Now! Shit! All right. All right. Ah! Fuck! I dropped my wallet. I'll be right back. Meet us at the car! Right now! Okay, I'll be out there. What the fuck! Oh, come on. Oh, shit! Come on. Oh, fuck me! Oh, shit! Come on! There's been a shooting... Oh, shit! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Sully, man, you were right. There's over $1 OO, OOO here! Hello? Yeah. I called earlier about an old woman? Tarzo. How is she doing? Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Mary. Yeah, it's me. No. Something good finally happened to us. I got lucky. I got lucky. I hit the daily number. Uh-huh. I know, I... I... It just happened. It just... It just... I don't know about this, Sully. I hope we don't make a mistake. I hope we didn't waste the money. No, no. This is the best money we've ever spent. It's for our baby's future, right? It's for our baby. Okay. Okay? Come on. Bye. Mary's on bed rest now, but otherwise we're great. Only two more months, Jas. We're getting close. And when he's born, I'm gonna bring him in here, and you can finally meet 'em both. What is it? Let me see. Let me see. He's gonna cure cancer. My boy is gonna cure cancer. Excuse me. Are you through? I said, are you finished? Um... 'Cause we've got business to do here. Okay. Thanks, Jas. Hey! Hey! Hey! Keep that, all right? Thanks. No, Eddie's gonna drive me in his new Mustang. Yeah. No... No, baby, don't move! Don't move, I'll get it. Just leave it there. Yes. No problem. All right, baby. I'll see you soon. I love you. Listen, I'm gonna take a piss, all right? You know, turn that thing off when it's done. Yeah, yeah, wash your hands. I don't want piss on the leather. Please take... Hello, guys, guys! This ain't a parking garage. What the fuck are you doing? Oh, we can't park here? You thought we forgot about you, huh? Your friend started bragging about his safe-cracking skills to the wrong fucking people, wise guy! Where's the other guy? And more importantly, where is the fucking money? Get him in the car, T. T! Get him in the car. Get him in there. This fucker says the other one went home already. Get the fuck outta my seat, asshole. Fuck! Sully. Hey, baby! What's wrong, honey? I did something. I did something bad, baby. What? Why are you crying? You're scaring me. What are you doing? I have to leave. I have to go. What? Where are you going? Oh, Mary. I'm so sorry for what I did. I'm so, so... I thought it was the right thing! What did you do? You're scaring the shit outta me, Sully. L... I... I stole the money so our child wouldn't be like me, all right? What? What are you talking about? For the procedure. I didn't hit the number! I stole the money from a fucking mob boss! And they found out it's me! - And they are coming after me! - I don't understand. You stole the money from a mob boss? I stole the goddamn money, because I am stupid! I'm so fucking stupid! Stop. Tell me this isn't happening. - And now I have to leave you. - Tell me you're lying to me. - I have to leave you. No, no! - Tell me this isn't true. - Or they're gonna kill me, all right? - Oh, God. - I have to leave you now. - No, this isn't happening. - I can't breathe, Sully. - Mary, my dear wife, I love you. I love you so much it hurts, all right? It hurts like a knife in the heart, all right? But I have to go. No, you can't leave me! You can't. Sully, there has to be another way. I mean, you're my husband. You're my love. We can talk to them, and they'll understand. - They won't. - They'll understand. They won't understand. You have to tell them that I left you. - No. - Yes! No. I'm coming with you. - I'm coming with you! - No! You can't! - I'm coming with you! - No! - You have to stay here! - We said we'll never be apart. I know! Just for a little while, just for a little while. All right? The baby, no, you'll lose him. All right? No! No! All right? You tell them that I left you, that I got some money, and I left you, you don't know where I am. I left you pregnant. They won't hurt you. They'll just watch you, and after a while they're gonna forget. They're gonna forget, and then you'll have the baby, and then you can come be with me, and everything will be fine. Everything will be exactly the way it's supposed to be. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - No! - Oh, Mary! - We had everything, Sully. - Why did you need more? - Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Sully! Sully! That's 43,OOO if you hit, Jasper. $43,OOO if you hit, Jasper. Good luck, Jasper. Hm? Good luck, Jasper. I hope tonight's your night. Post time 30 seconds. Mr. Tarzo, can I get you something nice? You know, we didn't come here for your fucking sandwiches, okay? Get your friend in the back, and go to work. Good luck, Jasper. That'll pay $47,OOO if it hits. $47,OOO if it hits. For 20 years this deaf bastard's been coming in here every night and laying down a single trifecta bet. Never hit. Until now. Oh, yeah? - It's fucking crazy! - Ha! Wow! Good for you, Jasper. You deserve it. What are you gonna do with all this money? What are you gonna buy? What are you going to buy? What are you going to buy? You still haven't spent a dime? Jas! I would have spent it all by now! What are you doing? "I have no use for it. " Oh, wow! Take a trip or something, get away a bit! Not I... No! No, no. Mary's on bed rest. Otherwise she's great, she's great. Only two more months. We're getting close. And after he's born, Jas, I'm gonna walk him in here so you can finally meet 'em both. Cure cancer. My boy is going to cure cancer! Excuse me. Are you through? Take care, Jas. Hey! I was part of the team who caught Saddam Hussen. I stopped questonng my choce to be a solder that day. You know, catchng such an evI man. A man responsble for kllng thousands. And n some way, n helpng capture hm, I stopped any future evI he could do. It felt good. It felt bg. People may never know what I dd, but I know... God knows. God knows who I am, and that's what's mportant. I dd somethng sgnfcant. What took you so long, old man? What, what do you want? He wants to ask me something. All right, go ahead. - I'll wait for you at the car. - Yeah. What? Why? Christ! You got an answer for that, too, huh? All right, bring $1,200 dollars tomorrow, and you'll have one. You're welcome. This is some serious bullshit! Baby-sitting some psycho gangster in a motherfucking tree! And it's raining, no less! I know that you think that I'm a lunatic, that I'm a sick, crazy fuck, but I am not. I told you, I can't talk to you. You gotta listen, then. I am gonna be up here. I am not coming down. Now, if you help me with the completion of my task and tell someone that I am here, then we can go home. I don't have the money, all right? Why would I fucking lie? Listen to me, Sully. This is not about revenge. We're not Parmie Tarzo. Tarzo's gone. But the money you stole is ours, and we want it. You'll give it to us, and you're free. I don't have it. Hey! Don't make us visit your wife to find out where it is. Um... I... I... Hold on! No! Ah! Hey! Wait! All right. L... I can find... I... I... I can find the money. L... I can get it. - Good, good. - I can get it. Yeah. Good. He can get it. ALBl: What are you doing? Why ain't you working? There's someone out front to see you. Then get behind the counter, all right? You saved us, Jasper. You saved us. Wuh! Mr. Tarzo? Over here! Over here! I don't have time! Who are you? I'm a reporter with the Island Advance. I wanna get a statement from you. Could you please stand? We don't have a lot of time. According to Officer Rodriguez, I'm not supposed to be here. Why is a reputed mobster sitting in a tree? Reputed mobster, reputed mobster... I'm just a man... ...trying to save this ancient Indian land... ...from destruction. The forest tends to the need... ...tends to the needs of the human race. Providing us with wildlife, and controls flooding... It's a... It's a pollution removal... In turn, we need to protect it for future generations. I can't do this by myself, though. I can't do it alone. I need some help to do this. Okay, let's get a photo. Okay. Give me a nice pose there. Give me a photo here. We've got something for the front page. Here we go. Good. Uh-huh! Great. Give me something for the history books. Thank you. Thank you. Great! I gotta go. Thank you, Mr. Tarzo, and good luck. You let her in here? Is that what you did? You did that for me? Mr. Tarzo! Mr. Tarzo, get up, papo! Mr. Tarzo! It's me, Officer Rodriguez, please! Wake up! What's going on? It worked! What you've done. Your story appeared in a newspaper. Everyone read it. I can't fuckin' believe it. Look. Man, look! All these people, they just bumrushed the forest this morning with chains and shit. The fuckin' mayor is on his way. He's considering stopping all the construction. He says it's important. You did it, Mr. Tarzo. This is fucking big. The Native American thanks you! Tarzo! Tarzo! Tarzo! Tarzo! Now get the fuck down. Where were you all morning? Forget it. Look, forget it! You're wanted in the back. Ma? Ma? I just... Parmie? Parmie! Parmie! Parmie! What are you doing here, old man? Sullivan! Hey! Sullivan! Sullivan! Oh, my God! What happened? Is he okay? Are you okay? What happened? Oh, no! Are you all right? Why didn't you answer me, Mister? You sure you're okay? Anything else? No? Okay. God, I was calling and calling. No one answered. Why...? Why don't you...? Oh! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you for helping him. Thank you. He likes you. Come on, Sullivan. It's time to go. No, he's not deaf. He picks up things from TV. I've never seen him sign before. Wanna go? Bye, now. Are you okay? You don't want to say good-bye? Bye! How's your knee?
