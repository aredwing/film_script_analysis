Hi, Charlie. It's Carol|from the LA Temp Agency. Listen, Dr. Batel's office needs you|for tomorrow. Is that okay? Let me know. Bye. Good morning, neighbor. Hey.|Help yourself. Oh, thanks.|I was out of everything. Aw, why do I even bother? You know, Remy, I gave you|that key for emergencies. Extreme emergencies. It was.|I needed caffeine. I don't know.|This is good. I'd even wear it. Good, 'cause I've got to go.|I'm late for my first client. But you stay,|have breakfast, take a shower. Go through my drawers. # Tell Mama # # All about it # # Tell Mama # # What you want # # Tell Mama... # - Hey, Charlie.|- Morning. - Are the boys ready?|- Dragon! Zorro! Hey!|There are my boys. Come on. Yay. - See you later!|- Bye! - Be good, boys!|- Whoa! Slow down! # Tell Mama|all about it # # Tell Mama|what you need... # "Romance is in the air today. No one can resist|your obvious charms." Well, Otis, your horoscope|seems accurate. Stop it.|Come on. Let's read mine.|Okay. "Do not leave your house today."|Too late. "And stop looking so hard.|Love is right in front of you." Hey.|What's wrong? I ordered a nonfat latte.|I can taste the fat. I would be happy|to change it for you, sir. Can't you even make a friggin' cup|of coffee? I can taste the fat. How hard it is to make|a friggin' cup of coffee? I can make another one|for you if you'd like. I'd be happy - to exchange it for you, sir.|- Hello? It's okay. - You've done enough, thanks.|- I'm sorry. Karma. - Have a good one.|- Thanks, girl! - Oh, sorry.|- Oh, I'm sorry. Hi. Hi. I don't know how|to read tarot cards. - Why am I in the cards?|- Come on, just try. Okay, well, this crazy old lady|keeps coming up. The knight|in shining armor. - Mmm! That's mine.|- No no no. What? - I saw this guy twice today.|- That guy? Two times in one day.|That's got to be a sign, right? Mm, a sign. Yeah, okay. What did he say|when you talked to him? I didn't talk to him. Well, are you sure|he saw you? Yeah!|I mean, I think so. Okay, honey,|we're worried about you because you're turning|into a little bit of a freak. Yeah, we think|it's from not having sex. - Exactly.|- Look, just because... I haven't been in|a relationship in a while doesn't mean|I'm miserable. I just want a sweet guy, you know, a guy|who's strong but still... ...opens a door|once in a while. And who notices|things and... you know, maybe|makes a difference. Maybe he completes you. Oh. You complete me. Oh, sorry. Dr. Batel's office.|Hi, Mrs. Reynolds. - Go to Grandma's, tell her|I'll be home late. - I still have stitches to do...|- Yeah, can you please hold? I'll see you|at home. You know what? You go ahead.|I can do that for you. - Oh thank you, Charlie. You're a doll.|- No problem. Hey, George. - How're you doing, Charlie?|- Good. - What do you got there?|- The doctor asked me to bring it from home. Whew! Okay! All right. The doctor|will be right with you. # I said "Leap into|my arms, babe" # - Thank you.|- # Come on, dive into the stove... # We're here! Thank God|you guys are here. I am down two girls|tonight. Here. - Sorry, that's all I got left.|- Sweet. Wow. You know, I love that I am|now comfortable enough with my sexuality - to wear something like this, you know?|- Looks good on you. - Hey, what's up?|- Take off the apron now. - Sorry.|- Where do we start? Okay, uh, hand out|these shrimp balls. There has got to be|a better name for those. - I don't think it's that bad of a name.|- What's wrong with the name? # I said, I say,|sometimes we look back... # - Oh my God, that's him.|- Whoa! Who? Who? The guy I ran into.|He's here. - Where?|- What? That is three times in two days.|What are the chances of that? - Um, like, none.|- That's Dr. Fields. This is his party. He just moved|back from San Francisco. - Really?|- Yeah. Well, you're right.|He is hot. # Flirting|with disaster # # You're the one|I'm after # # I think I've found|my destiny # # I can fly # # On the wings|of my heart # # Deep inside # # I've been falling apart # # L-l-love # # There's a magic in you # # And I'll be # - # Under your spell... # |- Here's the best part. The guy then goes|into cardiac arrest, Kevin performs CPR|on the guy, saves his life again. God.|Disgusting, isn't he? No, you are amazing. Yeah. Excuse me? W-wait wait wait.|What do we have there? Oh, um, balls. Uh, shrimp balls. Um, shrimp in... ...balls. I'm sorry, but we're not really|into fish genitalia. Yeah, okay. Was she really listening|to our conversation? Excuse me. Wait a second. Um, so I know two things|about you... you work in catering, and you have a lot of dogs. Oh, that... no. Uh, I'm a dog walker. I'm not some crazy dog-lady|with 12,000 dogs. - That's why.|- And I'm sorry about before. I didn't mean|to be eavesdropping. Well, you're right.|You shouldn't have. You should have stayed|and talked to me. Well, your girlfriend|seemed pretty offended. Oh no, that's...|that's not my girlfriend. I-I don't have a...|I'm sing... I don't have|a girlfriend. What? Nothing. Nothing. Um, I'm Charlie.|Charlotte, but Charlie. Well, I'm... I'm Kevin. - Nice to meet you.|- Nice to meet you, too. Uh-oh. What? What does|"uh-oh" mean? It looks like someone else|is mowing your lawn, Fiona. I'm gonna go|destroy these. Excuse me.|I'll see you guys. Oh, my shoes|are killing me which means|they must look fabulous. Can I get you anything? One of him on a platter. Such a waste. What's a waste? Oh, you didn't know? Kevin's gay. - What?|- Yeah. That's Kit, the groom. Or maybe he's the bride.|I can't remember which one's the top|and which one's the bottom. Yeah, they're getting married|next Christmas in Maui. I didn't get that vibe. Trust me. Thanks. Look at|that dude's arms! I used to have|such good gaydar. Oh, you're home.|Thank God. - I'm exhausted.|- What did you do today? - Hi, it's Charlie. Leave a message.|- Went to the post office. Uh, hi, Charlie. - This is Kevin Fields.|- That's him. I don't know if you remember me|from the party the other night, but I was just calling,|uh, to see if, um, maybe... maybe you wanted|to walk my dog. What? No! Hang up the phone. No, actually, you can't,|because I don't have a dog. So maybe you could|walk me. Hang it up. All right, you know,|I'm-I'm gonna go now. Call me at 555-0118|and ask for Dr. Fields. Okay, thanks. Bye. Oh man, that was...|that was horrible. Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath|for a callback on that. Yeah, she'll call me back|if she wants to walk an idiot. Yeah, I'm not going|to disagree with you. So takeout|or raid your fridge? Here we go. Take it easy, Lilly. Easy. Hi. You never called me back so I figured|I would bring the coffee to you. Thanks. Um, look, I think you're|a really nice guy and everything, but I don't know why|you called me. - Hmm?|- I'm a woman. Yeah, I love that fact. Have you ever been|with a woman? Excuse me? I mean, have you only|ever been with men? Men?|What are you talking... whoa whoa whoa.|Wait a minute, I'm not gay. - You're not?|- No. No, I like women.|Lots of... no, not lots of women, but you know what I mean. Why did you think|I was gay? Awkward. Okay, I got to go now. Wait wait.|Wait wait wait. Okay, I'll prove to you|that I'm not gay. Let me take you out on Friday night.|We'll watch the playoffs, I'll order a pizza,|I'll completely ignore you. Give me one good reason. 'Cause I'm different. Really? Okay, what color|are my eyes? Well, at first glance,|your eyes are brown. But when the light hits them|they change to amber. And if you look really closely around the|iris the color is pure honey. But when you look|into the sun they almost look green. That's my favorite. How did I do? I would've settled|for brown. - Okay!|- Peanut, let go! Off! Off! I'm sorry he bit you. I mean, they all have their shots|so it should be fine. Seriously, don't worry about it.|It barely broke the skin. - Outside.|- Did you just move in or something? No, I've been here|a year and a half. Oh, nice place. I should have some hydrogen peroxide|around here somewhere. What is all this stuff? Oh, I'm a yoga instructor. - This?|- And a Little League coach. And a dog walker|and a caterer. I told you I'm a temp. That is not true.|She is an incredibly talented artist. - Remy! Remy!|- I mean, look at her sketchbook. - She hides it right under there.|- Remy! What? He's not... - Are you all right?|- Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Found it! So you're an artist, too? Uh, I like to dabble|in a lot of different things. I mean, life's too short|to live the same day twice, right? Yeah. That's a good|philosophy to live by. My dad always used|to say that. Come on. - Used to?|- Oh, yeah, - my parents died when I was little.|- Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay.|It was a really long time ago. - You ready?|- Yeah... I mean, it's a little embarrassing.|I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's supposed|to look at the... ah! Ow! - Oh my God. I'm sorry!|- I'm just kidding. I never get to do that. Okay, because the cut is,|like, three inches higher. Sorry. - Do you need my phone?|- Oh, no thanks. It's just my mom. And it's only|her second page of the day. She's just getting started. - Well, you're all set.|- Thank you. So, do you think, uh... we could do this again sometime,|maybe without the biting? Yeah, that would be nice. - Heard from Kevin yet?|- Not yet. I've paged him. Would you page|him again? - Good morning, Stan.|- Good morning. - You're in a good mood.|- The last time the network executives came to my dressing room|I got my own show and a big fat raise. - Yeah and I had to start kissing your...|- Viola Fields? Oh my God! It is such an honor|to meet you. Oh thank you, darling. Would you mind|just signing this autograph? For my grandmother. I'd love to. You know what else|I'd love? I'd love you to get me a latte.|Do you mind? - Okay.|- Thanks, hon. Hi, guys.|How are you? That woman is a legend. Shouldn't you be|getting the latte? I just can't believe|they picked me to replace her. Oh, shit! I-I've been replaced? I'm so sorry, Viola. Psst!|I'm fine. I mean, you've had|an amazing career, Viola. It's just that we're trying to appeal|to a younger demographic. I'm fine. I'm fine. God damn!|Get my manager on the phone! And then I'm gonna call|the head of the... Uh, we're on in two minutes. - Okay.|- Will you get her to come? - Please!|- Okay, she'll be ready. I'm ready. # ... love got jeans|and a tee # # Am I kinky or sweet? # - # Take a look inside my makeup bag # |- # Ooh # # If you wanna love me # # How good or bad|I can be... # - Are you okay?|- I'm great. Hey, I've had|a great run. I've done exclusives|with Kissinger, the Dalai Lama, Muhammad Ali... four sitting presidents... three of them hit on me. Five Emmys! Now I'm being replaced|by a young thing whose grandmother|loves me. You know what|I'm gonna do? I'm gonna finish out|my contract and I'm gonna leave this show|with my dignity intact. Okay, coming back|from commercial. Three, cue announcer. Today on "Public Intimacy," pop singing sensation|Tanya Murphy. And now we're live|with Viola Fields. Four, three, two... Well, that was|very nice. My goodness, you have a big voice|for such a tiny girl. You're gonna miss|Viola Fields. Have you always|been a singer? Ever since I was|a child. I would sing|in school plays, choirs. - How old are you?|- I'll be 17 next month. W-what do you do for fun? I love watching|really old movies. - They're my favorite.|- Really? Really, which ones? Well, "Grease"|and "Grease II." Um, "Benji."|I love "Benji." "Free Willy," um... "Legally Blonde," "The Little Mermaid." - Oh.|- Yeah... oh, I know. You ever read|a newspaper? Newspaper? Viola, the girl|has stars on her nipples. I don't have|much time for that. So basically, you have absolutely|no idea what's going on in the world? - Oh, l...|- And yet, you've sold over five million albums... CDs,|to millions of kids - who listen to your insipid lyrics.|- What is she doing? "You want to know me,|look in my makeup bag." You're influencing|an entire generation of kids who won't know how|to think straight, or vote for a president, or remember the significance|of Roe versus Wade. Oh! I don't support|boxing as a sport. I think|it's too violent. Y'all better get that|little girl out of there. - Holy crap!|- Get us off the air! - Quick!|- Go to commercial! Go to commercial! Crazy bitch!|Get off me! - Cut! Cut! Put in the Bow Flex tape!|- Get her off! Juice Man, something! Oh, I don't support|boxing as a sport. I think|it's too violent. Oh. I wanted you to take one last look|at the old Viola. Oh, thank God|I've changed. Yes. Well, just remember the breakdown was|only a few months ago so take it nice|and slow out there. No stress. Absolutely. In fact, I'm going|to take a vacation. I've been promising my son|we'd go to Africa since he was a little boy. And I finally have|the time. That's wonderful. Not to worry, I'm in complete control. Ruby! Ruby,|my dear old friend. Oh, I'm so happy|to see you. Well, good,|they still have you medicated. Ruby, I figured it out. - Life, I mean.|- Oh, this ought to be good. It's not about how many celebrities|I interview or what my ratings are. - It's about relationships and family.|- Oh! Me and my son. Oh, I just spoke to Kevin. - Did you get the tickets?|- Sure did. Right here. He's going|to be so surprised. Yeah, the three of you|should have a good time. - Three?|- Yeah, uh, you, Kevin - and his new girlfriend.|- New girlfriend? That's a lovely surprise. Is it? Well, I mean,|it can't be too serious. I've only been away|a few months. Well, that's|the end of it. Where do you want me|to put this? Oh, under the bed. Uh, you sure you don't want me|to put it by the door so you can make a quick escape to the apartment you|still have for some reason? Now come on. You agreed to me|subletting my apartment. I would have agreed to anything|to get you to move in here. Oh, these are great.|Are they new? Oh, no!|You can't look at those! - 'Cause they're not finished yet.|- Oh, sorry. - Okay? Please?|- Okay. Here, I'll put them back. I forgot to tell you, we're having lunch|with my mom tomorrow. Oh! It'll be fine.|I promise. You want|to take a shower? Hmm. Yeah! Okay! # It's just a ride,|it's just a ride # # No need to run,|no need to hide # # It'll take you|round and round. # All right, so tell me|about your dad. Well, he died|when I was two. But that was just|her first husband. At the time she was|a freelance journalist and then she married this guy|who was a network exec and got her her first|on-air break, but divorced him|for Alec Wrigley. Wait, the actor?|I thought he was... Oh, he was.|It lasted about two years till she threw him out for sleeping|with her second husband. Wait, how many times|has she been married? - Well, four.|- Wow. But, you know, her career|was always the main thing. She just lived for it.|Well, her career and me, of course. And, basically,|now I'm all she's got. Here we are. Oh, no. Oh, playing dress-up,|are we? - Shut up. Is that the Dalai Lama?|- Yeah. - Oh my God, That can't be real.|- It is. Did you know|all these people? - Some of them.|- Kevin! - Look at you, all handsome.|- Ruby! Good to see you. Yeah, you too. Now, forget about|my mother. This is the woman you need|to get through. Charlie, this is Ruby. - Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.|- Oh, the pleasure's mine. Uh, excuse us.|I've got to talk to him about a rash. You're bringing a girl home|to meet your mother now? Yeah, Ruby, I am. The women is fresh off|the funny farm. I mean, why don't you|come back, let's say... next spring? Oh, the trees|will be blooming. - It'll be so beautiful. She'll love it.|- How is she? She's good.|The first thing she did when she got home was make me|lock up all the booze. It's Oprah! Oprah! Yeah, Oprah. There's one in there|with the cast from "Good Times" too. So how big is this place? About four acres.|There's a tennis court, two swimming pools,|indoor and outdoor... it's kind of crazy. What?|No helicopter pad? Oh, no.|There's one out back. I'm kidding. Kevin! Oh, I've missed you|so much! I promise I'll never|leave you again. Oh my God, Mom.|Look at you. You look fantastic. - It's just something I threw together.|- Come here. - What?|- I want to introduce you to someone. - Charlie. Mom.|- Kevin. Charlie, this is Mom. Mom, Charlie. Oh, hi. Oh, I'd love to just be able|to think of it and make it. I must have spent|the last 30 years looking for the perfect|little black... - Cocktail dress.|...cocktail dress. Yes. I know. Well, it doesn't matter. You could|wear anything with your figure. - I mean, you look amazing.|- Oh, honey, thanks. Listen, when you're my age,|if ain't broke, you fix it before it is. Why the question mark? Oh, 'cause|I just don't know. I love your jewelry. - Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.|- I love that. - I like it... the earth tones.|- It's fantastic. - Where did you get this from?|- My first husband. That's Kevin's father. He gave it to me|when we were in Peru. - It's very earthy.|- It's like the dress, very earthy. I just think it's wonderful|that you've tried so many temp jobs. Think of all|the experiences you have. You've been|so quiet, Kevin. Oh, well, it's kind of hard to get|a word in edgewise with you two. Oh, is he great,|or what? I tell you too,|that's a little scary. Enjoy it while you can. Here you go,|some more coffee. Actually, I was a little nervous|about the two of you meeting. - Really?|- Why? Well, 'cause it's|important to me. Mom, you're the most|amazing woman I've ever known. And, Charlie,|I've never met anyone like you. You're real,|you're honest. And although we've only|known each other a few months, I-I feel like|I've known you forever. I guess what I'm|trying to say here... is what are you doing|for the rest of your life? What? Oh my God! Charlie, will you|marry me? It's...|it's too sudden. - She's in shock.|- No! - I mean, I am, but...|- Yes! Seriously? Seriously. No no. Say "no." Yes. Yes! Yeah! Oh, gee... oh! Oh, I'm so happy for you. - Congratulations!|- Oh my God. I can't believe this. I am so happy for you. Congratulations!|I'm so pleased that you're going to be|my daughter-in-law. Oh, congratulations. - I can't believe this.|- I'm so happy for you. - Thank you!|- You're going to need a moment alone. - Excuse me, I'll be right back.|- Okay. Oh! Shit! Medicine. Let's see. No. What's... ah! - You are so crazy! Oh my God!|- I almost forgot. I've been carrying this around for two|weeks waiting for the perfect moment. I can't believe this|turned out to be it. - Kevin.|- Try it on. It is the perfect moment. Maybe you should go|check on your mom. Oh, she's fine. She's probably|calling all of our relatives. Oh, Holy Spirit... surround me with light. Please rid me|of my negative karma and my wickedness. Please help me be|a better person. I could just kill|that dog-walking slut! Of course. She's pregnant. So, goodness.|That was a lot to take in at teatime. - Oh, you're telling me.|- I had no idea that you guys|were so serious. Kevin, you never|mentioned anything. - Mom.|- Here's what I want to say. It's wonderful|being in love. But I don't think marriage is|the best solution to a thing like this. Well, you know nowadays|a girl has so many alternatives to getting married...|there's adoption, abortion, - lesbianism... Hmm?|- Whoa, Mom! - What are you talking about?|- Well, I mean, it's so sudden I have to assume|there's a pressing reason. Oh oh, no. Charlie's not pregnant. Call me old-fashioned, marriage is a sacred union that should only be entered into|with the utmost care. Weren't you married|four times? Yes, dear. Which would make me an expert,|don't you think? Excuse me. It's the hospital.|I'll be right back. Okay. You want me to go|with you? No, stay right there. You know, this is as sudden|for me as it is for you. It's too sudden, right? You think? Yeah. Really? I mean, what's the rush?|It's not like the old days where you had to get married|and have kids, and have it all figured out|by the time you were 21. - Exactly.|- We have options now. And I've always liked|having my options, you know? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.|Yeah. This is so... big. What am I...|what am I doing? I love Kevin. I want to spend the rest|of my life with him. Oh my God!|I'm getting married! Ruby! Ruby, I need a bottle of champagne.|We're going to celebrate. May I have the key|to the liquor cabinet please? What key? The key, Ruby. Key?|There's no key. Ruby, give me the key. You want to take this|outside? Bring me the key. And fix your hair. You look like|a damned cockatoo. She is such|a fabulous assistant. Hey, do you think|your mother liked me? Of course. Why? I don't know, because she called me|a pregnant lesbian? I'm sure she meant that|as a compliment. Trust me.|She loved you. Oh, they're gone? I'll just put this baby|back to bed, okay? My son|the brilliant surgeon is gonna marry a temp. Gonna need something|stronger than this. Where's that martini? Hooch will not solve|your problems. She's going to destroy him. It is so clear. She's got no money,|no career goals. She was just waiting|for a rich innocent to step right|in her path. Oh, Kevin's|smarter than that. Come on,|you raised him well. He's a good boy. But he's a man.|That's the problem. The only time they think straight|is when they have an erection, and it's usually pointed|right at the trampiest woman. You talking about|her or you? Look, there's nothing|you can do. Just let it go. You know what you need?|A project. Or another husband. You know, why don't you|marry another gay guy? That was fun. You know, you're right. I do need a project. And I have|the perfect one. I am going|to save my son. Here. - What?|- You go use those old contacts of yours to get all the information you can|about that little pimp. And exactly what do you|expect to find? Everybody's got|a past, honey. Find something. And I'm going to open up|the Montecito house and get a party planner. I'm going to give them|an engagement party. And then what?|Lock her in the basement? When he sees how out of place|she is in his world, it's gonna be over. This will end badly. Get me another one|of those. # Ooh-ohh # # I just want to|get down with you # # Eh! # # I just want|to get close to you # # Ooh-ohh # # I just need to go|farther... # Is it me, or is each house|you take me to bigger than the last? But I thought your mom|said this was a barbecue. Oh my God. It looks like she's invited|everyone I've ever known. And they're all|in black tie. Oh, there's my mom.|Mom! Darlings!|How was the trip? - Welcome.|- I'm sorry. - I didn't know this was a formal party.|- Well, that's because I have something for you.|I bought you a new dress. Oh, see?|There's a dress upstairs. - Thank you.|- Besides, you look great in anything. Exactly. You always look|so clean and shiny. Oh, Kevin, your tuxedo|is upstairs in your room. But first I want you to meet|some friends. Come. - Prince Amir.|- Can I change first? - This is Sarah. Kevin.|- You know Kevin. And this is Charlie.|She's a temp. Charlie, this is the man that introduced the|euro to the global market. - Mr. Prime Minister.|- Viola. Oh, Marie. You know my son,|but this is Charlie. - Very good to meet you.|- So nice to meet you. - She's a temp.|- Yeah. I worked in a bank once. Oh, look! There's|the Poet Laureate and... oh, Charlie, first I want you to meet|the Secretary of Commerce. Viola, please let me|change first. I don't want to meet her|in my flip-flops. Of course, of course. Ruby, would|you show Charlie to the guest room? - Come on, Charlie.|- Thank you. Thank you. Wow! Oh my... it's vintage. Oh, Fiona. - You look stunning.|- Thank you. So do you. My goodness. Kevin just went up|to his old room. - Why don't you go say hello to him?|- I'd love to. Good girl. Fiona, what are you doing here?|I'm dressing. Why don't you let me give you|a hand with that? Give it up, Fiona. You know, you and I had|a very strong bond once. No, you and I had|very strong drinks once. That's not true. Kiss me. I'll remind you|how good it was. What are you doing? I'm engaged.|I'm happy. It's gonna fit! Why did she get me|such a small dress? I have two asses. It'll fit.|There we go. Okay. Okay! Okay! What is it about her|that's so special? I don't know but I plan on spending|the rest of my life finding out. Kevin! God! Men in love|are really hot. Fiona! Oops! Um... I was just giving Kevin|a congratulatory kiss. Don't, uh, worry. Why would I worry?|He's gay, right? Charlie! Charlie, that was not|what it looked like. I'm going home. I've destroyed|priceless couture. I embarrassed myself|in front of 70% of the world's royalty. Oh! I forgot, yeah! I just caught you making out|with your ex-girlfriend. Charlie, let me explain. Ugh!|It doesn't matter. I can't do this. I don't belong here,|Kevin. And if I don't belong here|then maybe we don't... Hey hey hey.|Listen to me. It's you and me now. This isn't my world anymore. You're my world. Okay? Now let's get the hell out of here.|I'm taking you home. Okay. Um... Let me try and get out|of this dress and then... Okay, see you|downstairs. # There's a million miles|to go # # Till our happiness lives # # There's a million miles|to go # # Till our happiness lives. # Do you like it? Yeah, it's great. I'm so glad you|finally decided to do it. I don't know. I just woke up today|and it just felt like home. I'm gonna do|all three walls. You know, I think it's time|to take a break. Oh, wait! - Wait a minute.|- Whoo whoo whoo! I can't let it dry|too much. Oh God! Are we getting out of bed|today, "Camille"? What for? I could die|and nobody would care. I would. You promised me|a face-lift. Sit down, Ruby.|Sit with me, hold my hand. Have you got anything|on the girl yet? Nothing. Nada. No criminal record.|No debt. Good grades. Went to design school.|And then a string of odd jobs. Isn't that exactly what|somebody with a past does? What about drugs?|What about promiscuity? She's had fewer lovers|in her entire life than you did|at closing day of Woodstock. Well, find something. Well, I guess if I had|a hair sample maybe I could take it - to my little crime lab and...|- Perfect. I'll get to work on it. Listen to me.|There is nothing. Has it ever occurred to you|that maybe she's a good girl? Oh, don't joke. I would like to speak to that woman|who got back from the loony bin. Is she around? Because you are taking me|for a spin in the crazy mobile. Ruby, Ruby. Everybody knows that when|a woman marries a man she marries his mother|too, right? What if I drive her crazy? Okay, now you're|foaming at the mouth. Oh! Charlie and Kevin's house. Oh, I forgot you live there. I didn't realize that you|had already moved in. Kevin, stop it. I'm on the phone|with your mother! I'm sorry, Viola. The slut's practically|fornicating with him! - Stop it!|- I don't blame her. That boy's a fine piece of ass. Hold on, Viola.|He's... stop it! Right here. Actually, Charlie,|the reason I'm calling is I wondered if you'd|like to have lunch next week. - Really?|- How would Tuesday work for you? Yeah,|Tuesday's perfect! Listen, Viola, I'm kind of in the middle|of something right now, um, but Tuesday's fine. Yeah, me too. - Lots to do!|- Okay, bye! Oh. I'll go get the vodka. It's good to see you. There she is. Charlotte. Hi. I'm going to have|the garden salad and the low-cal Chinese dressing|and a decaf iced tea. - And you, miss?|- Oh, um, I'll just have a... cheeseburger|with fries and a soda. - All right.|- Okay. You continue|to surprise me. Aren't you worried about fitting|in your wedding dress? Well, I mean, I'm making the dress|to fit my body, not the other way|around. Whoa. I wish I had been|that confident when I got married. I'll tell you one thing|you're gonna have that I never did, a stupendous wedding. And it's important that we|book the church right away. I always thought|that Kevin looked like Jesus in the cathedral down|on Second Street. Mmm. Actually, we were thinking|of having... a non-denominational|service, being that I'm more spiritual|than religious. Oh. What about my place then? That way we don't even|need to book a location. And Kevin was born there|and grew up there. Oh, it would mean|so much to him. I'll plan it all. We'll have that marvelous band|that the Swansons' had at their wedding. And a divine cake.|Oh, honey! No no no!|Tsk tsk tsk! Chewing,|it's a disgusting habit. Oh, hold still.|I've gotta... gotta... - There! Got it!|- Ow! Thanks, um... What do you think|about peach? - Oh, um, excuse me.|- Yes? Can I get another salad|without the nuts? - I have allergies.|- Okay. I'm allergic to nuts,|and eggs, and shellfish, and blueberries.|Oh... and soy. It's amazing you've been able|to nourish yourself all these years. Oh, yeah!|The cake! I'm thinking traditional vanilla|with strawberry drizzle. Look, Viola, I really do|have all of this under control. I made this for you. It's your wedding planner book.|Peach. Oh. Is that a picture|of me and Kevin? Oh, and... present time|from your new mama! Thanks. Wow! It's big! You can see|the thorns on the roses. You'll wear it on your wedding day,|just like I did. Of course I was|a virgin when I wed. But we'll just pretend|with you. Now, about the wedding... the two of you are going to arrive|in a horse and carriage. And the driver's top-hat|will match the horse's saddles, and the ribbons|on the doves that will be released|at the exact moment of "I do," hmm? And I've been in touch|with your bridesmaids. How do you know|their names? Well, Kevin told me.|And I think for the honeymoon St. Bart's is the absolute|best place for you to go - 'cause Kevin adores it.|- Hey, just hold on! Just wait|a minute, okay? No. Thank you, but no. Thank you,|but no to everything. No to the horse|and buggy. No to the top-hats,|and to the doves and geese and any other farm animals|you're thinking of using that day. And definitely no to you|planning our honeymoon. - What?|- Oh no. I can... oh! - Oh oh!|- What's wrong? - "Oh no" what?|- My pills, my pills! Okay.|Well, let me help you. - Oh!|- Viola! - Oh, no!|- Wait, Viola! Viola! Viola! Oh my God, Viola.|Oh my God! - Give her some room.|- Help! - Give her some air.|- My God, is she dead? - No!|- Get her some help. It couldn't be|that easy. She's had|an anxiety attack, which can feel like|a heart attack. She's gonna be okay. But she definitely needs|to take it easy. No stress. She said that you were|yelling at her, that you refused her gift|and said she couldn't plan our wedding. Tell me that's|not true. Well, technically... yes. But, hold on.|I didn't yell at her. And she just kept pushing|and pushing and pushing. And, okay, I admit it.|I snapped a little bit. But... What was I supposed to do?|She wouldn't take no for an answer. Come on, look, you know|what a hard time she's been having. - So she's a little difficult.|- Difficult? A two-year-old|is difficult. - She's like... ah!|- Come on, she's all alone. I'm all she's got...|we're all she's got. Come on. Excuse me. I'm Dr. Chamberlain,|the psychiatrist in residence. - Are you Mrs. Fields's son?|- Yes. - May we speak in private?|- Actually, this is my fiance. We can talk.|Um, is she okay? Well, I just completed your mother's|interview and I'm concerned. It's possible that she's on the verge|of a psychotic break. I should probably see her|at least twice a week, minimum. Also, I prescribed her|some anti-anxiety medication. If she starts to feel|overwhelmed, they'll relax her. Does she live alone? Uh, yeah. Well, I feel|it would be best if she were cared for|by relatives... people that are closest|to her during this time. Just until we're confident|that she's out of danger. All right.|Well, thank you, Doctor. Oh, God. I've got that|medical conference. What am I gonna do? You know what?|Don't... don't worry about it. Um, I'll take care of her. Thank you. - Come on.|- What? - No, come with me.|- No no, the doctor said no stress. - Charlie, come on. Enough already.|- I'll stay here. Kevin! Come on. I am so sorry. No, Mom, don't be.|It's okay, really. Charlie? I'm sorry too, Viola. No, I was too pushy. No. You weren't.|Look, Viola... I would love it if you would|help me with the wedding. It's all right,|sweetheart, l... I don't really think|I'm up to it. My nerves are shot. Mom... Mom, Charlie and I think|you should live with us for a while, until you feel better. Are you sure? Oh! Oh, I can't possibly. - I couldn't.|- Mom, it's okay. Relax. I couldn't possibly. Not unless I know|Charlotte's forgiven me. Will you? Me? Yeah, I forgive you. You just put those|anywhere. - Hi!|- Hi. - Are you feeling better?|- I'm much better, thank you. - Great.|- Sweetheart, I'm kind of thirsty. - Would you... is the kitchen over there?|- Yeah, sure. - Great. Goodbye.|- Okay. - Hey, Charlie.|- Are you moving in, too? No, I don't like|the neighborhood. Look, do you have any|firearms in the house? - No.|- You might want to get one. When will you be back? Soon as I can, honey.|I promise. Are you sure|you're gonna be okay? Yeah. I mean, hey,|it's only at night, right? And, I mean, she's gonna|sleep most of the time with those pills|the doctor gave her. Right? Look, I know my mom can be|a little challenging. So if you have any|problems just call me. I'm on the first flight back,|I promise. Okay.|Well, hurry home. And who knows?|By the time I get back, maybe you two|will be best friends. Oh, am I interrupting|something? - Uh, no, Mom, come in.|- The caterer called. He still thinks|I'm doing the wedding. He sent over a sample plate|'cause I gave him the colors you wanted. I said absolutely no peach. And from now on, everything|goes through my new daughter. - Thank you.|- Yeah? Okay, I'll be|right down, thanks. - Oh, here. Look.|- Oh, it's beautiful, Viola. - Thank you.|- Oh, I'm glad you like it. - Thanks.|- My car's here. Gotta go. - Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.|- Okay. Oh, bye, sweetie.|Oh, it's gonna be fun. - We're gonna have such a good time.|- I love you. - I'll be a good roommate. I promise.|- Okay. Ohh! It's so nice|to have a girlfriend. Yeah, huh? Viola? - Are you all right?|- I can't sleep. I feel so alone. I do. You're not alone.|I'm here. Did you take|your pills? My pills?|Oh no, I forgot. Could you get them|for me, sweetie? They're on the sink. Sure. Here they are. - Thank you.|- You're welcome. Oh, I don't have any water.|Could you get me some water please? Okay. Oh, I can't drink out|of the tap. Would you get me some Evian...|with ice? Yeah. Here you go. Oh, thank you. You have a good night,|okay? Charlotte? I hate to ask you this, but it's my|first night here. Could you stay with me? Please? Sleep with me.|Be a good girl. Huh? No no no! No no, don't! God! Viola! - Are you okay?|- No, let go of me, you! No. Huh? Oh! Okay. Okay. Hi, how was your day? It was... okay. Wonderful! You're cooking. I wanted to make you|dinner all by myself. - Sit.|- Okay. It's steak|and kidney pie. Actually, the steak didn't defrost|in time so it's mostly kidney. Mmm! - Do you like it?|- Mm-hm! I made a decision today. I called my lawyer|and I asked him to redo my will. I want to include|my new daughter. Really, Viola,|that's not necessary. Oh, don't be silly.|I want to. Of course they have all these|stupid questions that they want to ask. You know, like, "Are you|currently an illegal alien?" Oh, uh, no. Oh, that's interesting.|Okay. Um, are there any hereditary illnesses|in your family? You know, the kind that could be|passed on to grandchildren? - Uh, no.|- No. How many men have you been|sexually active with? What? Why would they|want to know that? That many, huh? Would you be willing to sign|a prenuptial agreement? - Excuse me?|- I know. They're such nosy bastards.|It's none of their business. Let's just deal|with this later. No, why don't we deal|with it right now? I'll tell you what,|I'll clean up the kitchen and you continue|enjoying your dinner. No no no. You did all the cooking.|I'll clean up. - Are you sure?|- Yeah. I am kind of tired.|Thanks. Well, I'll just|go up to bed then. I had kind of a difficult|night last night. You had a difficult night? He's skidding|out of control. This bus is out of control. Is somebody there? Tina. Tina. Who the hell is that? Oh. What?|Oh my God. - I thought you were sleeping.|- Well, I couldn't sleep. Hmm? What do you think|of my outfit? This is a ceremonial robe|given to me by Chairman Mao. These go with the robe. This was a birthday gift|from the Dalai Lama. He never forgot|my birthday. Of course now|he doesn't care anymore. - Do you mind if I sit with you?|- No. - Just for a little while.|- Okay. Why is she running? Well, someone's|chasing her. Why is he chasing her? I'm not sure. Well, who is he? I don't know.|We have to watch. - You have to stop talking.|- Mm. Don't you hate|what she's wearing? Running out there|with bare feet and, what is that, a pajama top?|It's so unrealistic. I once did a whole segment|on nighttime television. You would not believe how much the demographics|influence the networks. I mean it's just ridiculous.|All they care about is the bottom line. Oh, it's so nice just to sit|with family and do nothing, huh? Don't even need to talk.|It's wonderful. I miss so much|being a working mom. I used to bring Kevin,|though, to the set. That's where he met|Gore Vidal and Jackie Chan. Is there anybody famous|in this movie? Because I don't know|any of them. And they all look|the same... all the girls have the same body,|all the boys have the same hair. ...so many beautiful people|who live in Los Angeles? I think all the beautiful genes|ended up in California. Why is he kissing her?|It's beyond me. I'm sorry. I thought|it was air freshener. - Charlie?|- Dr. Batel's office. Miss Reynolds? Hi. Yeah. Nope. Okay. Bye. Oh God. I-I'm sorry. You know what?|That's probably my fault. I mean,|I never thought she'd... I mean, she's a little|eccentric, you know? - I'm sorry.|- Well, It doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about your mom|tonight. I want to talk about us. - I miss you.|- I miss you too. Especially now|when I'm in the tub... naked and wet... and naked. Really? Well, do you know what I would do|to you if I was there? - What?|- Well, for starters... Charlie! - I'm not looking. I'm not looking.|- Hello? - I just wanted to return your shampoo.|- Your mom just walked in. You really should use a shampoo|that doesn't dry your hair so much. We don't want a bride|with straw under her veil. - Oh, is that Kevin?|- Yeah, it is. - Honey, your mom wants to talk to you.|- Sweetie, hi. - Hi, Mom.|- Honey, I can't thank you both enough. - Of course.|- I'm having the most wonderful time. - How's Charlie?|- Oh, she's been a doll. We've been girlfriends|all week. - Great.|- I'm gonna be sad to go home. You do? Well, you never know|what the future's gonna bring right? I mean, I do love|this neighborhood. In fact, you know,|two doors down, there's this house|for sale. It's got two|big bay windows and a great rose garden. You know how|I love rose gardens. And basically,|it's got my name all over it. I'm having my...|my... um... real estate guy|look into it. She's buying a house here? Two doors away. "Lovely property.|Beautiful bay windows." It's bullshit! She doesn't even like|this neighborhood. Oh God, I'm so exhausted. She's driving me insane! - I can't do this.|- Yes, you can! Stop being|such a big baby. Kevin is the best thing|that ever happened to you. Charlie, do not|give up on this one. It seems Mommy Dearest|has been keeping a very close eye on you,|sweetie. What are you talking about?|What are you doing in her clothes? I was just upstairs in her room|minding my own business. And I found all of this|in her closet. She's been|investigating you. Whoa. Why does she have|your high school transcripts? I know. There's a picture of me|at the beach?! - Yes, it is.|- I can't believe that. There's another picture|of you in here. And it's... look. Look at that.|It's like a closeup. But you have to be close|to take that, right? Look at all this Gucci! It's just|Gucci Gucci Gucci! She has skin caviar.|This stuff sells for $400 a jar. - I've heard of that. I want a try.|- Here. - Mm.|- Doesn't that smell good? Ooh, hello. What are these? Those are|just her anti-anxiety pills. - Ooh, these are good.|- Really? They'd knock out a horse.|I have these at home. - You do?|- Wait I don't know what these are.|But they're definitely not what I take. They smell like|oranges or something. - Are you sure?|- Yeah. Let me see. Hi, Andy.|It's Charlie. Now, I'm not working|for Dr. Batel's office this week. But I had a question.|Yeah, about some pills. Can I stop by? Charlie, I'm having|a bit of a bad day, so Ruby's gonna take me|to see Dr. Chamberlain. Okay!|You take care! Let's see|what you're up to. - There you go.|- Thank you. Thank you so much. - And thank you.|- Wear that, sister. Okay, now Cartier|is one right down. - Where's Niketown?|- What? - Niketown.|- Niketown? Bad day, my ass. Wait a minute. Dr. Chamberlain? All right. Hello? Hey, Andy. What are they? Chewable vitamin Cs, huh? Okay, thanks. I know. I can't believe|the wedding's only a week away. No, we do the final|walk-through on Monday. Oh! Wait a minute.|I think I hear her car. Drop my stuff|at my house, okay? All right.|Look crazy. Charlie! Ch-ch-ch... Ch-ch-ahh...|Charlie! Oh, I had to bring him|home with me today. He's harmless. Sit. No! No. No. No, Zorro! Sit! Is that expensive? It was. Sorry! Oh! Charlie! Bonus. Good boy.|Come on. Come on. Mmm. Hello, old friend. Viola! You can't mix alcohol|with your pills! I'm a little upset as you can imagine. Well, I know that and I'm sorry,|but your doctor said if you're feeling upset that you should take|your pills, not alcohol. So you relax.|I'll get them. Shit. Here we go. This will make|you feel better. Drink up. Now I hope you like|what I made. It's one of my mother's|specialties. - What's that?|- Tripe. It's a delicacy. Try it. It's like nothing|you've ever tasted. Trust me. So Kevin called. He's coming home tomorrow.|I can't wait. I'm so excited.|I miss him so much. I was thinking maybe the three of us|could go to lunch tomorrow. What do you think? Yeah, I think it's|a great idea too. I'll make reservations. It'll be so much fun. Don't you just love|being girlfriends? Night-night,|sleep tight. And good morning|to you too. - Ruby, is that you?|- In here! Oh my God.|Is she all right? I thought she went|to bed. I don't know.|I haven't seen her like this since "The View"|won an Emmy. I wish I could stay|and help but I've got to go|pick up Kevin at the airport. What? I underestimated you. You don't need a gun. I don't know|what you're talking about. Mm-hm. Last call! We'll see you|tomorrow night. Uh, there's a reservation|under Fields, Kevin. Yes, right this way. I'm so glad my mom and you|had a great week. We did. I learned|a lot about her. So who's|the mystery guest? Oh, surprise! I thought your office|said we were having lunch alone. Well, I hope you guys|forgive me. I just... I wanted to talk|to you and Kevin together. So how are you, Mom? Fine. Though I did have|a rather difficult night. Ooh, it was probably|that martini you had. Mom, you're not supposed|to be drink alcohol with those pills|you're taking. You know, the truth is I owe you an apology. You know, I was so insensitive|to your feelings about wanting to help|with the wedding. Oh, it's ancient history. A young bride doesn't want to hear|the opinions of an old widow. No no,|that is not true. I mean, you're going|to be my mom soon. And a grandma shortly|after, hopefully. And I want you to know|that I will do anything it takes to make this|relationship work. That said... will you be my maid... I mean, my matron|of honor? Charlie, that's...|that's amazing. - Mom, what do you say?|- But, uh... Morgan is gonna be|your maid of honor. Oh no, she has graciously|relinquished her title to you. And I had this|specially made up. A dress in your|favorite color... peach. - Come on, open it.|- Well, that's... Char... ah. I-I don't think I can. Mom, I think|it's a great idea. I just don't think|I'm up to it. I really don't. I've got|to talk to my doctor. Oh, I called him.|Yeah! And he said he thought|it was a great idea. - You called my psychiatrist?|- Mm-hmm. In fact, we had lunch|at The lvy. Well, anyway... he said, considering|this turning point in your life, you know, losing|so much so suddenly, that being involved|in the future would be the best therapy|in the world for you right now. Careful. You know|those are strong. You know, we...|are your future. And we want you|to be part of it. I can have a list of duties|for you tomorrow. No. M-mom... no, Mom. Mom, don't cry. Here. Charlie. I didn't think|I would be this emotional. Mom, here.|Can I? Oh, oh! Oh, thank you, baby.|I love you. - I love you too.|- I love you too! I love you too, Mom. Kevin, you know what? Why don't you|give your mom and I a moment alone? Yes, of course. Just so you know,|the crying bits are getting old. Just so you know,|Kevin likes his girls thin. Oh! Well,|I can always get liposuction. I've been meaning to ask.|Is it painful? That maid of honor bit. Priceless! You know what they say? Keep your|friends close, keep your enemies closer. - Oh!|- Now you listen to me. This is my game now. You are going to tell Kevin that you|are not moving into our neighborhood, and that you've decided|that you're feeling like it's time that you go on|with your own life! You're moving out|of our house immediately. This is over! Oh! This isn't over,|not even close, girlie! Well, bring it on,|Grandma. That little bitch! Let's go someplace near|the ocean and drink lunch. What? You know exactly what. Move! Move! Move! What's wrong with you? I am sick.|I am sick sick sick of your shit. And I when I'm not sick,|I'm tired. I am sick and tired. What are you saying? Damn you|and your luggage! Ruby, you're not going|to leave me too, are you? No, I'm not leaving you! You old slut! Ruby! - Ruby, please...|- Hey, you almost forgot your dress! You'll have nothing|to wear to the wedding. See you, Ruby! Maybe we can get you|a matching bonnet. See you|at the rehearsal dinner! Motherf...! So, how's the bride-to-be|holding up? Ooh, under the circumstances|I'd say mediocre. But she's tough. Not as tough|as the old bird. - What does that mean?|- For your own safety, make sure you know where|the emergency exits are at all times. Hey, are you|and my mom okay? Great. Yeah, I just have a little|of the pre-wedding nerves, but everything's|under control. Of course. Hello, everyone! Welcome|to the rehearsal dinner. - My God, she looks amazing.|- I know. Oh! Father Tyson. Hello, Blaire. Kit, how are you? Hello, hello. - Oh, you are Morgan.|- Yes. I have heard so much about your delicious|catering service. Oh! Oh, wow! I have a lot of friends.|You're going to be a busy girl. - And you're Remy.|- Yeah. I recognize you from all the wonderful|things Charlie's told me about you. Wow. Well, Ms. Fields,|I have to say... - Oh, call me Viola. Please, I insist.|- Viola. - All right, I'm gonna go get a drink.|- Okay. I'm such a huge fan. - Oh, you...|- Oh, l... Well, mi casa, su casa.|Make yourself at home. - Thank you. Bye, Viola.|- Cheers. - Goodbye.|- I like her a lot. Hi. - Hey!|- Hi! - You guys have a nice little chit-chat? - Oh|my God. She came over and started talking to us.|What did you want us to do? - Ignore her?|- Yes! So then getting her autograph|would be completely out of the question? - Was that yes? 'Cause... okay.|- No. So there I was sitting next|to the Sultan of Brunei with Maureen Dowd,|Carrie Fisher and Snoop Dogg. You know the story, Kevin. I said to Snoop, "Snoop,|I think your lyrics are sometimes a little|sexist and unfair to women." And the Sultan of Brunei said,|"Really? I have 114 wives and they're all|huge fans of the Dogg!" Honey, would you see|who's at the door? Sure. These are delicious, Viola. Oh, Kit,|I'm glad you like it. Mm, yeah. Look who's here.|It's Dr. Chamberlain. Oh my God!|It's Dr. Chamberlain. - Hi! Everybody, it's Dr. Chamberlain!|- Hi. Good evening. - Thanks so much for inviting me.|- Oh, shit! That's Dr. Chamberlain.|He's Viola's doctor. Oh, we're going to need|another place setting. Oh, please,|let me get that. - There's a chair in the living room.|- Sure. Scootch down, you guys.|Come on, make room. You guys move down. Cheers. Thank you. Who's he? It's Viola's therapist.|Move down, you guys! - Excuse me.|- No problem. - Here's you chair, Doctor.|- Here. Have mine, too. Hello. Hi. - Hi.|- Hi. I'll get it. So you just got here? - Are you expecting anyone else?|- Huh-uh. - Hello, everybody!|- Fiona! I'm so glad to see you. I just couldn't resist|bringing the happy couple a little gift. That's great. I will|get you a place setting. She's bringing a gift?|I think she is the gift. What the hell|is she doing here? - How about some more wine, everyone?|- Yeah! How much longer do we have to stay?|I have midterms tomorrow. Shh. - Oh, I get it.|- No, baby, not now, okay? It's not the time. So, Dr. Chamberlain, tell us about med school.|Where did you do your residency? Uh, now that's...|that's a long story. I don't think your guests|want to hear that. No, we really|want to know. I think we need|some more gravy. What is going on? What are you doing? I'm behaving. Viola, no! You can't!|Charlie's allergic to nuts! Give it to me! Viola, you're crazy. Oh, get up. Put the gravy down|or I'm telling Kevin. Yeah! What's the big deal?|So her face swells up... swells up a little.|So what? Swells up a little? Her face'll|blow up like a Macy's Day balloon. Well, good. It'll match|the other body parts! Viola, think about|what you're doing. Come on, the girl's|getting married tomorrow! Ruby, when did you|lose your edge? Right after|you lost your mind. Come on. All right. Okay.|No nuts. Come on. Viola, I think you|dislocated my vagina. - Where's the...|- Where's the what? Gravy? More gravy? Anyone for more gravy? Oh, I am not|doing time for you! - Where's the back door?|- Stay cool, Ruby! Stay cool! This is no time|to lose your nerve. If I get arrested|I'm gonna sing like a canary. Maybe she won't|take any gravy. - That's a lot of gravy.|- Mmm! This gravy's delicious! You... you gotta go|stop her! - Go on, stop her. Go stop her.|- You go, you go, you go. Why me?|You're the culprit? You go! - You're my assistant.|- What am I supposed to do? Go out there and stick my finger|down her throat? Yeah. Baby, are you okay? Kevin, my tongue|feels weird. I think|something's wrong! Charlie, are you okay? - What are we gonna do now?|- Hide the damn nuts! - Are you all right?|- Get her some water. Flat or sparkling? The caterer says he doesn't know how|this could have happened. Well, I feel like I ate|a loaf of nuts. I mean, even my tongue|is swollen. You're marrying|a big, fat, puffy tomato mouth. It's not that bad, really. Besides,|the swelling's already going down. - Yeah?|- Hey, Kev. - Yeah.|- Just coming to check up on the bride-to-be.|For the love of God... - Out!|- You see? I told you it looks terrible. - I told you.|- Baby, I promise you. In 24 hours the swelling|will be completely gone. Give me that! Door was open. Oh thank God. - The Bride of Frankenstein is gone.|- I know. I was up half|the night worrying. - You look great.|- I just don't know - how those nuts got in there.|- Yeah. Hmm.|Wait. Hey, do you think|she would... No! Come on. I mean, she's crazy, but she's not like,|psycho-killer crazy. Hmm. No! Oh, hey, I was wondering.|Could I bring a date to your wedding? Of course. My God.|How exciting. Great. Thanks.|So then, I'll see you later. But... w-wait! - Who is he? Tell me!|- Oh, it's... okay, don't be mad.|It's Dr. Chamberlain. Actually "Paul." - Is that his real name?|- That's very funny. I gotta go get a mani, pedi|and my eyebrows waxed. But I'll see you in|a couple hours, okay? - Oh, let me go down with you.|- Okay. Oh God. She added|even more ruffles! Where's your prom date,|senorita? Oh, wait a minute. This is too|damn good. Where's my camera? This is just too good. Will you just get me|out of this right now? Come here. - Cheers.|- Hey. Thanks for coming. Okay, guys, let's go see|how Charlie's doing. Ah, yes, please. Uh-huh. Oh my God. Those are|so much better than mine. Don't... touch me! I got out of that car|the same way I got in it... without you.|Now where is she? You here with the bride|or the groom? I'm here with my mother. Oh. She looked a lot older. I... Well, look|what we have here. Oh my God. You look beautiful.|Oh my God. - Oh my God.|- This is it! Yeah! - Oh God, did you talk to the priest?|- I talked to him. He's just going|to skip right over that whole - "if anyone should object" part.|- Okay. You're a vision in white,|sweetie, really. Knock knock.|Look at you! And so is your|mother-in-law. Mm. Mm-mm-mm. All right.|Everybody out. Out.|Give the bride a moment. - No way.|- What? What is that? - What?|- Where's your bridesmaid's dress? Oh, I gave it|to Ruby's daughter. She works at Hooters.|She was thrilled. I don't have a daughter? Oh. Rude. Take off that|white dress right now or I'll take it off|for you. Don't you tell me|what to do! You did not|just poke me! Don't you touch me,|you two-bit tramp! Oh my God!|Viola, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to... You don't go and slap somebody|then apologize. Get some backbone! God! This is crazy! Why don't you just|face it? I'm marrying Kevin today and there's|nothing you can do about it. You face it! You'll never be|good enough for him! Didn't stop you|from marrying my son. - Oh God, no.|- Well, look at you. All in white. You are so predictable. Oh, Gertrude.|I didn't know you were coming. You didn't? Wonder why.|Oh, I know. You didn't send me|an invitation! I thought you|were dead. But evil doesn't die|so easily. I heard you got sacked|and thrown into a loony bin. - Oh! Oh!|- My congratulations. Oh my God. Oh my God! These hors d'oeuvres|taste like old socks. Now, I want to get an up-close look|at the bride. Holy Toledo! You are a stunner! My grandson|is a lucky fellah. Look, what he did. He went out and found|himself an exotic Latina! Would that my son|had been that lucky. Here we go again. What? You were|a television weatherwoman in Dubuque, Montana. You drove around|in a broken-down minivan and you drank red wine|from a box! Classy. You killed him,|you know? - What?!|- You killed him. All the doctors agreed, my son died|of terminal disappointment! If anybody killed him,|you did. You smothered him|to death! Nobody was ever|good enough for him! My God, you look old! Fine. This woman is going|to drive me insane. Now, I'd rather not|take all the credit. You'll get over it. - Okay, I love you.|- You're kidding. This is never gonna end, is it? I mean, that's going|to be me and you in 30 years. We'll be doing|the exact same thing. You know what? I wanted to marry Kevin|because we make each other happy. But you're never gonna|let that happen. Are you? Oh my God.|I can't believe I'm saying this. You win, Viola. What do you mean? The wedding's off. Bye, Ruby. I-I cannot believe|she compared me to Gertrude. I know.|Now that's just wrong. - Thank you.|- You are far worse. I don't recall Gertrude|ever trying to poison you. And I'm pretty sure|she wore black to your wedding. Black. Yeah, she said|she was in mourning. Mm-hmm. I just want my son|to be happy. Whatever made you|think he wasn't? Hey, what are you|doing here? Don't you know it's|bad luck to see the... Charlie, what's wrong? What is it? Are you nervous? Hey. - Kevin, I need...|- Charlie, I need to talk to you. - Viola, stop it!|- It's the flower girls. - They're drunk again.|- What? Yeah, in the toilet. Not now, Viola, okay? It's really important. Just give us a minute.|She'll be right there. Please? Charlie, what is it? I'll be right back. What do you want, Viola? I don't want you|to walk out on this wedding. You don't? No, I don't. What, am I supposed to believe|that you've had some epiphany? That all of the sudden,|everything is going to be different? It's never been|about you, Charlie. It's me. I've been so afraid|of losing him. He's the only family|I've got. This is my chance|for a family, too. - And I'm scared.|- Oh! Don't blow your chance|for happiness. You've never needed|my approval. He's loved you|from the very beginning. And I promise I will|get out of the way and let the two of you|be happy. That's not what I want. I mean, there just has|to be some boundaries, Viola. I can do boundaries! I don't love boundaries|but I can do them. How about the number of times|you call Kevin a day? Can we limit that|to, like, one? Oh, I need at least|four minimum. - He's 35 years old.|- Three? - Two.|- Deal. Two long-ass calls! When Kevin and I|have kids, he and I will decide|how they're raised. All right. But you know I have|raised one wonderful boy. - And my advice could be very...|- Will be solicited when needed. All right, as long as one kid|is named after me. - Middle name.|- Deal. What else? Holidays|and special occasions. Are you gonna keep|me away? You must be present|for every Christmas, Thanksgiving,|birthday, school play,|clarinet recital and soccer game|in our kids' lives. I want you to love them|and spoil them and teach them things|that Kevin and I can't. Like how to throw|a right hook for example. I want you there, Viola. I do, up front and center. From this point|I will not negotiate. Damn. That girl can give|a nice little speech. Deal? Oh... can they call me "Aunt Viola"|instead of "Grandma"? Fine. Come on, unzip me. Viola, you don't|have to wear that dress, really. Yes, I do. Really. Go, Kevin and Charlie! Yeah! Mom! Do you really think I would leave without|saying goodbye? I love you, Mom. - Thanks for everything.|- Go. Bye, you guys! Okay, everybody gather around|the back of the car! Charlie! Charlie, right here!|Right here, Charlie! Sheesh. - Oh, Hawaii! I cannot wait!|- I know. I can't either. Have a great|time in Hawaii! - Good luck!|- Have fun in Hawaii! Just you and me|now, Ruby! Jesus. Who did I kill|in a past life? And take off|that damn dress. You look like|a giant peach cobbler. You're making me hungry.
