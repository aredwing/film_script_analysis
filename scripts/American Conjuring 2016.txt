Can't even throw the ball right. Should have learned how to throw a ball for your birthday. - You're right, the new girl is a loser. She couldn't even hit an elephant if it was standing on her foot. - I could too. Why are you so mean to me, Jenna? - I'm bored. I don't wanna play this stupid game anymore. - I don't know about this, you guys. Ms. Donna and Ms. Nina said we weren't allowed in the basement at anytime. - You were supposed to be here an hour ago to help me with the party. You know, it's Sarah's birthday. She's only been here for a week. You know, she still hasn't settled in properly. She's not getting on that well with the girls. She could really use this. It would give her a sense of belonging, and a sense of family. Get here in 30 minutes or we're gonna have a problem. No, I gotta call you back. Oh my God. - Well, there it is. - What am I supposed to do? - It's simple. You go inside and look around. Stay down there for five minutes. Macy will time you. - Gotcha. My watch keeps good time. - Then what? - Then you come out. You're part of the club. We go have some cake and punch. - Five minutes? - Five minutes. - Donna's gonna wonder where Sarah is. - Shut up. If she asks, we don't know where she is. - It's Sarah's birthday, Jenna. She's gonna wonder. - I said shut up. We won't get in trouble if you don't blab. - Where's Sarah? None of you girls have seen Sarah and you're all supposed to be playing together. Jenna. I know you're always up to something. Where's Sarah? - I swear, Ms. Donna. I don't know where she is. - Katie. - Me neither. - She said she was going to the bathroom. - Okay, well, why didn't you say that when I asked you before? - Ah... I didn't wanna get in trouble. - Why would you get in trouble for answering my question? - I don't know. - Okay, well, I gotta go inside and get the Kool-Aid. So if she gets back before I do, you make sure she doesn't go anywhere, and I do not want to see any finger trails in the icing. You understand? - We understand, Miss Donna. - We won't let her go anywhere. - Good. You have been here for all of the girls birthdays, and I really need you here for this one. You know, Sarah likes you. Yes, yes, I'm sure you'll make it up to her. Listen, just get here. Okay? Bye. Good God. Shit! - We're pinched for sure. - No way. She totally bought Macy's bathroom story. - She knew we were lying. - That's because you acted like we did something when we didn't. - Hey, here comes Sarah. - Are you okay, Sarah? - Yes. - Sarah, are you all right? - Sarah. Sarah. Sarah! Sarah. What have you done? Sarah, what have you done? - It was here at the Carrington Orphanage at 5980 Carpenter Road in this building behind me where the lifeless bodies of three young girls were found brutally murdered at the hands of one of their own. Sarah Thompson was only 11 years old when she took a butcher knife and attacked the girls. Four years later, in a fit of depression and madness, she took her own life. She claimed that she was being haunted by the ghost of the house's original owner, Hester Corbett. Originally this building was built in 1896 by Paul and Hester Corbett, as they had plans to set up roots and start a family. Unfortunately, Hester's first attempt to have a child was a still birth. Devastated by the loss, Paul left Hester to live in the house alone. A few years later, a broken and depressed woman, Hester committed suicide by hanging herself in the basement. Local legend says that her soul is at unrest and she still walks the halls of this place. Searching for her still born baby. Zachery Warren, a paranormal investigator, claims that he made a recording of the deceased woman's voice last Halloween. - We were in the basement investigating, and we decided to do an EVP session. - Oh, what's an EVP? - Electronic Voice Phenomenon. It allows us to speak to spirits, and with the digital recorder we get to hear it back. - Are there any spirits in this house? - There have been many rumors that Haster Corbett was responsible for a slew of child murders during her stay in the house. Unfortunately, she killed herself before anyone could make the connection. We attempted to investigate some of these claims and were able to determine that in the years that she was alive, there were several unsolved child murders in the area. On the record books, she's innocent, but if you listen to local folklore, they say they got the record books wrong. In their eyes, she's a stone cold killer. - And you got this place for how much? I think Teddy hung you upside down and shuck your pockets out. - Hey, it may not look like much from the outside, but wait till you see what the inside looks like. Trust me. When we get crackin' on this place, we'll have it lookin' as good as new. Inside and out. - Uh-huh. I don't know, Benjamin Harrison. I was never keen on getting a fixer upper. What do you think, girls? Girls, what do you think? Zoe, get off your phone. - What? Jesus. - It looks like where vampires live. - Shut up. - What do you think, girls? Zoe, Zoe. Get off your phone. - What? - What do you think? - Holy shit. - Okay, don't swear. I told you not to talk like that around your sister. - I'm sorry, Mom, but Jesus. - Hey, I hate to interrupt this intellectual discussion you ladies are having, but, let's go see Teddy. That's his girlfriend's car. - You got a lot of guts comin' here. After what you pulled. How ya doin'? - Good, good. How are you? - Carol, so good to see you. - Hi. - Zoe, Alyssa, I don't believe you've met my girlfriend Joan. - So nice to meet you ladies. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you too. - So, ya'll ready to see the new digs? - Can hardly wait. I was telling that to Ben all the way over. - Then let's get too it. - Hey Chloe. Get back here you dumb dog. - Alyssa. - Hey, let her go. You know, this is our new house. She needs to get the lay of the land anyway. - I can wait out here and make sure she's okay if you all wanna go ahead. - See, Joan will be out here too. Come on, let's go inside. - Let's go. La castle de Ben awaits. This is the highest room in the building. Take a look out these windows here, you can almost see clear through to Amero county. - Wow, really? - Yeah, on a clear and sunny day. - Oh, of course, it's not a clear and sunny day. - Ben, this is the perfect room for you to set up your office. - Yeah, no kidding. I wanna start writing a novel. This'll be the perfect place to just get it out of the way. You know, avoid some distractions. - Or make a great room for me. - I don't think so, Missy. Your room is next to Alyssa's downstairs. - Oh, I don't think so, Mom. Seriously, she'd be bugging me 24/7 to play with her dolls. That kid is so annoying. - Zoe, zip it. - Unfortunately, all of the bedrooms are on the second floor next to the bathrooms and kitchen. The little apartment sandwich. There are some unfinished rooms in the basement though. Perfect for wallowing in teenage angst. - No thanks, I'm not actually one of those weird emo kids who likes to spend all their time in a dark basement. - Are you sure about that? Some of that music you listen to is pretty dark. - God Mom, like yours is any better. - Okay, girls, come on. - Personally, I enjoy the musical stylings of Fetus Grinder. Ah, shall I show you the rest of the house? - Wait, so what was this place before? - What do you mean? - Well, I mean like, it's super dark and creepy. Was is like an insane asylum? - Zoe, it's... - Don't. Don't worry about it. I can assure you it most certainly was not an insane asylum. Nor did anything devious or unseemly happen here. It was an orphanage for a short while in the '60s, but then closed it down and the family took over. No, nothing bad ever happened here. Just good people trying to raise families. Like you folks. - Yeah, you obviously don't know our family too well. - Zoe, please. - Teddy, please forgive our teenage daughter. You know, she's at that tender age where she likes to do anything she can to get a rise out of her parents. - Well, only one of my parents is here. - Zoe, stop it! - I like this one. You should keep her. She reminds me of me. Used to say just about anything to make my parental units squirm. Ah, basement. Basement. - Oh my God. - Why would you do something like that? - Mom, I didn't do that. - Your behavior today has been intolerable. You know, Ben is trying to be a good Dad to you. Don't give him such a hard time. - Well, he's not my Dad, Mom. Remember you divorced my Dad. - You and I are gonna have a long chat later. - As you can see, there's not a lot of things that need any major repairs. Most of it's cosmetic. You might to change out some plumbing or replace some shingles, but that's about it. - Well, I'm hoping that doesn't cost too much. I kinda went over my budget on this one. - Over your budget? You low-balling bastard. I'm givin' away my inheritance here. Besides, if you decided you didn't wanna stay, you could always fix the place up on the cheap, and sell it for a nice profit. - No, I think after doing all that work we would stick around. - Good to hear. Joan and I will be close by. You can come over, barbecue, weekends. Sunday fun-day, my friend. - Are there any other kids around here? - I'm sure there are. - Who was the lady that was upstairs? - Lady? What lady, baby? - When I went to get Chloe, there was woman upstairs looking at me. - Maybe you were just looking at me. Or Zoe. - I know what you guys look like. It wasn't either of you. - Well, I assure you, there's nobody else here but us. - Right, so even though it looks like Dracula lives here, it's just the regular old Harrison's. - Hey, it doesn't look like Dracula lives here, okay. Stop scaring your sister. - Fine, the Adams family then. - Zoe, cut it out will you. - I'm not scared, Mommy. I know that this is all fake anyway. - Smart girl. Well, let's see the rest of the house. Shall we? Ah shit. I thought this was gonna happen. - Who is that? - I'll take care of it. - Teddy, please don't tell me... - It's already done. - What? Did you tell them what happened here? Get your fucking hands off me, Teddy. - If you fuck this up for me, you're gonna regret it. Do you understand me? - What is that? A threat? - Abso-fucking-lutely it's a threat. And if you show your face around here again, I'll have you locked up for trespassing. - Well, if you're not gonna tell them, I am, and you can't... - That would be very wise of you. - Fuck you, Teddy! - Now get the hell out of here before I call the cops. - This man is not your friend. You need to get out of here as soon as you can, because terrible things happened in this house. - I'm callin' the cops. Joaney! - Don't bother Joaney. I'm leaving. Don't you forget what I said. - I don't know about you, but that lady that stopped by today, she kinda has me spooked. - Don't worry, okay. Teddy said we shouldn't believe anything she was saying. I for one think she may have been hittin' the sauce today. - I wonder what kind of terrible things she was talking about though. - Did something bad happen here, Mommy? - No, don't worry. Nothing bad happened here. - I think that lady was just trying to scare us. - Duh. I mean, obviously you can't get a place this size for the price that Ben paid. Not unless something really shitty happened here. - Stop it, you're scaring your sister. And another thing, you're supposed to be calling him Dad, not Ben. - Whatever. - Look, we've had it with your horrible attitude. Just go inside the house, please. - Fine, Ben. - I'm startin' to think she's never gonna like me. - I used to be like that when I was 17. She just needs some time. - I don't hate you, Daddy. - Oh, thank you, baby. I love you. - I love you too. - And look, I know this place is a bit intimidating, sure it's big and scary, but it's just a house. Once we clean it up and we paint some of the walls, it's really gonna start feeling like our home. We just have to give it a chance. So what color do you wanna paint your bedroom? - Can it be pink? - Absolutely. It's your bedroom, it can be any color you want it to be. - Hear that, Mommy? I get a pink room. - You lucky girl. I want a pink room. - No, no way. Then I would have to sleep in a pink room. Come on, let's bring the rest of this stuff inside. Alyssa, is that you? Zoe? Playing one of your silly games, huh? Yeah, well, if you girls are trying to scare me, just remember I don't scare easily. And I will get back to you when you least expect it. Yeah, whatever, you girls have your fun. I have work to do. - What you doin', babe? - Oh, I'm just tryin' to move some of the stuff out of the way. Looks like the previous owners were gonna renovate the place, and just abandoned their plans. A lot of unfinished projects here. - That's odd. I wonder why. - I don't know. What, are you cold? - Oh, my God, yes. I'm freezing. This house is chilling me to the bone. - Really? I guess I didn't notice. Too busy moving stuff around. Chopping wood, doin' the man stuff. - Okay, Mr. Manly man. Do you wanna go check on the heat? - Oh, you got it. Love you. - I love you too. - Girls, are you down here? Okay, this whole sneaking around, trying to scare Daddy thing is getting kind of old. Oh, ha ha. Very fun. The old rocking chair joke, huh. - That's gonna leave a mark. - Ben, honey, can you hear me? - Daddy, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. Daddy's okay. Just uh... - Let's get you up. - Just clumsy. - Let's get you upstairs. - Glad you're okay, Daddy. - Yeah, me too, pumpkin. Just a big ol' headache. - Are you okay, honey? You've hardly touched your food. - I'm fine, I'm just not really hungry. - Is it your stomach? I can go get the... - Dad, may I be excused? - Is everything okay? - Yeah, I just said I'm fine. I just kind of wanna be by myself for a while. - Well, you could be a little nicer to your father. We're all tired, it doesn't allowed you to be rude. - Sorry, Dad. May I be excused now? - Yeah, go ahead. But don't stray off too far. We need to turn in soon. We have a busy day ahead of us tomorrow. We'll all sleep in the living room tonight. - You're kidding me? Right? - About what? - About all of use sleeping in the same room together. I was gonna take my sleeping bag upstairs to my new room and sleep there. - No, some of the lights aren't working up there, okay. We're unfamiliar with this place, and I don't want you to wind up hurting yourself if you got up during the night to go to the bathroom or something. - Jesus Christ, Dad. I'm not two years old. Mom? - I'm with your father on this. We're a family. Until we sort things out, we'll stick together. - I can not believe this shit. - Zoe said a bad word. - Zoe! - Alyssa, stay out of it. - Yes, ma'am. - I'm almost 17 years old. I should be able to make some of my own decisions where it comes to my personal welfare, and I don't think getting to sleep in my new room is asking too much. - Look, okay, we're not trying to run your life here, honey. It's a safety precaution is all. Once we move the stuff into your new room, and we fix all those lights, it won't be an issue. Now one night spent in the presence of your family won't kill you. - I've been in your presence all day long. - Fine, okay, just go then. Okay. My head hurts too much ragging you about this. - So, you just let her go then? - We need to turn in soon, okay. It's getting late. - Can I sleep in my room too? - No. - Zoe. - Stay here with the dog. Zoe. - Zoe, hang on. - I just need some air. It really stinks in here. - We all do. - Hey, come on, let's go, we'll clean this mess up in the morning. - Alyssa. Is that you down there? Alyssa, this is not funny. Oh, my God. You scared the daylights out of me. Don't ever sneak up on me like that again. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. You just scared me a little, that's all. I heard some sounds from the basement, some laughing, and it startled me. - Laughing? - Yeah, like a little girl. Are you sure you weren't playing a joke on Mommy? - No, it wasn't me, Mommy. Honest, it wasn't. - Where's your sister? - She went out on a walk. - It's okay, baby. I must be just tired from the move and all. Must be seeing things. - It's not a ghost is it? - No, baby. No, why would you say that? - I saw a lady in the window. She looked like she died. Is she mad at us for moving here? - No, baby. You're gonna scare yourself with all this ghost talk. There's nobody in this big old house except you, me, Zoe and Daddy. - And Chloe. Don't forget Chloe. - Who could forget about that big old mutt? Just remember, there's no such thing as ghosts. Now go back up to your room and start drawing. I'll be there after I get the laundry started. - Okay, Mommy. - Ben, Ben, there is someone in the basement. Someone's here. There was a ball and someone is hiding. - A ball? What the hell are you talking about? - Someone is in the house with us. Come. It came from down there. It rolled out of the darkness. The ball was covered in blood. - All right, stop it. You're scaring Alyssa. - I'm sorry, baby. But go check it out yourself. It's down by the laundry basket. - Jesus, calm down. - Why are you so angry? - Because this sounds goddamn ridiculous. - Do you see it? - No, no I don't. There's no ball covered in blood down here. What the hell are you trying to pull anyways? - What? Nothing. I'm not trying to pull anything. It was there, it rolled out in front of me. - Look, Carol. There's nothing down here. - Mom, I'm scared. - Don't worry, baby, okay. Mommy's just screwing around with us. Trying to pull a fast one. - I am not. - There's your applause, Carol. Yeah, great joke. You are a master prankster. - I am not making this up. There was a ball down there. - Carol, enough! - I'm sorry. You're right. - Yeah, I know. Now take Alyssa upstairs. I will do the goddamn laundry. If you didn't wanna do it, you could have just asked me. You didn't have to make up a stupid fucking story. - Watch your language. And I'm not lying. - Fuck. - What the fuck? - You should have seen your face. - Fuck you, you little bitch. Don't do that, I don't feel good. - I'm telling mom you're swearing at me. And smoking again. - Don't you fucking dare. I swear, you say one word and all your little dolls are going into the barbecue. - You would not. - Would to. - Would not. - Try me, little shit. Not stopping being a creep or go away. - Who are you texting? Some boy? Are you sending pictures of your private parts again? - Shut the hell up! - Ow. Why are you always so mean to me? - Do I need a reason? You're so goddamn annoying. - Just because we have different Daddies doesn't mean you have to be so mean to me all the time. - If it wasn't for your Dad, Ben, there wouldn't have been a divorce and we'd all still be together. - But if mommy didn't meet Daddy, I wouldn't have been born. - Yeah, my thoughts exactly. I wish you never born. K, now leave me alone. Fuck. - Zoe! Don't leave me out here. - What are you doin'? - Remember the mess that Zoe made last night? I got a job to do. - Yeah, right. - Where you goin'? - Well, the car's parked in the driveway, so I gotta go move it. Before the movers get here. - Probably a good idea. - Where are the girls? - Alyssa's in the den drawing, and I think Zoe went for a walk. - Is she doing okay? - Zoe? Yeah, surprisingly fine. It's like it never happened. No, I tried to give her something for her stomach, but she didn't wanna have anything. - Well, I guess we just keep an eye on her then. - Yeah. - Hopefully it's not a bug going around. We don't all need to get sick here. - Speaking of sick. - Don't have too much fun. - I won't. I've handled worse at the hospital. Damn it. Forgot the cleaner. Alyssa, no! Oh my God. - Mommy. Oh my God, honey. - Mommy, it hurts. - Put this under water. - Mommy, it hurts. - I know, baby. Press this on it. Oh God. - What happened? - Alyssa cut herself. And there's blood everywhere. She needs to go to the hospital. - Oh gee, okay calm down. K, calm down. I'll drive her into town and then find a hospital there. Jeez. - I stay back and wait for Zoe. - Okay, okay, good idea. Baby, how did you cut yourself? - Apparently she was playing in the utensils box, and got into the knives. - What? Hey, what have we told you about playing with sharp things? Huh? - I didn't want to. Daddy, it hurts. - Okay, don't worry. Okay, come on, let's go. - Hello. Hello. Stupid piece of shit phone doesn't get service anywhere. Hello. Who is this? - Zoe. - Who's there? - Zoe. - Zoe. - Our movers are here. - Yeah, sure looks like it. Hey, make sure you finish those candies before your Mom sees. She's gonna skim me alive for letting you eat that before dinner. - I promise I'll eat all my food, Daddy. - Oh yeah? We're havin' broccoli tonight. - Broccoli? Yucky. - That's okay. You've had a rough day. - Thanks Daddy. - So, we have some good news. The doctor said Alyssa really didn't cut too deeply. There's no damage to any of the major blood vessels, but she does have some stitches. Most of it was superficial. You're smoking again. I thought you quit months ago. - I did. - So, so why now? Is something else wrong? Yikes. - Our daughter drew those. - Alyssa drew these? - Yeah. - Look, kids drew weird stuff all time, okay. It's nothing to get bent out of shape about. But yeah, we probably should talk to her before school starts back. Don't really want the teachers to think we're raising the next Jeffrey Dahmer here. - This is no time to be joking. - This is our daughter, okay? I'm not joking about this. - Don't you find any of this just a little bit weird? - No, not particularly. What, should I? - Look, this one is of you, me and Zoe. The other night when she was sick. And it shows her vomiting up black. Do you know what I found when I went to clean her room, huh? - No, I don't. - A pile of black goo. It was filled with worms and bugs. - Well, it's probably something that she ate. Like, yeah, maybe I should have taken her to see the doctor too. - What about the bugs? - Maybe they crawled up from somewhere in this house. I don't know, okay. What do you want from me? - How could Alyssa have known any of it? She wasn't there, she was downstairs. And we didn't tell her any of it, because we didn't wanna upset her. - Okay, well, it sounds to me like somebody needs to take just a little siesta here. - Stop patronizing me. Don't you dare. Something is wrong here. - Okay, what exactly is wrong here then? - Okay, this one. Do you know when it was done? - No, I don't. - Alyssa didn't cut herself by accident. She did it on purpose. I saw her. This shows what happened before it even occurred. - I'm really not hearing this. - You have got to hear this. It is all true. - It's all bullshit, okay. Everything that's coming out of your mouth right now is bullshit. - It's not bullshit! It's all true, and that's not all. - Okay, what, so what else is wrong here then, huh? - Zoe was chased in the woods this afternoon on her walk. - What? Who, who did it? By who? Who was it? - I don't know, she didn't seem them. But it was someone that must have known because they kept saying her name like they were threatening her. - Fuck! - Watch your language. - I don't care, okay. Somebody was harassing our daughter, and I wanna know who is was so I can wring their neck. - Something's wrong with this place. It's possessed or haunted or something. - Are you serious? Haunted? Possessed? Do you even hear yourself right now? - You can joke all you like. Laugh all you like. But we're outta here. - What was that? Okay, you're gonna have to repeat yourself, 'cause I really don't think I heard you right. - I wanna take the girls and leave this place. You can come if you like, but we're out of here. - Do you have any idea how much money I just spent on this place? We just got here for Christ's sake, now you're talking about leaving it all behind. You must be out of your mind. - I thought you might say that. Well, the girls and I are leaving. You can do whatever you like. - You wanna act like a spoiled little brat and leave? Fine, go. But the girls are staying here, and that's final. - You can't bully me. We're going. - Yeah, like hell you are. - Daddy! - Jesus. - Carol. Honey, are you awake? Carol. You're awake. - I've been awake for a while. - So why don't you answer me then? Are you angry with me? You hardly said two words at dinner tonight. - No. Not angry, I've just been thinking about some stuff. - What's wrong? I mean, we're still friends aren't we? You can talk to me. - Of course we're still friends. Don't be silly. - So what's wrong? - It's just... Been bothering me. All this stuff that's been happening around the house. And how quick you are to dismiss that all. You and the girls must think I'm a total nut case. - None of us think that, okay. We just believe that you've been stressed, and that's leading to your anxieties getting the better of you. - That's just a nice way of saying that you think I'm crazy. - You're as mad as a hatter. - I knew it. - I mean, I always thought you were insane. - I'd have to be to be married to you, Benjamin Harrison. - That's true. However, there are crazier things in this world. - Such as? - Such as me marrying you. - Stop it. - How'd that get up here? - What? - The rocking chair. I saw it down in the basement earlier. It's how I got this knot on my head. It was right near the boiler. Did you bring it up here? - I just assumed you did. - No, I didn't. - Stop looking at the old chair, and start paying attention to your old lady. What the hell's wrong with you? You almost gave me a black eye. - Carol, there was somebody in the room with us. - There is nobody in here with us, are you out of your goddamn mind. - I saw her. It, she was on top of me. - She? Oh, so you're thinking about another woman when you're supposed to be making love... - I know, Jesus Christ, no, okay. I saw her with my own eyes. She was on top of ya. - There is nobody in here but us. You know what, I've had it. You're sleeping on the couch tonight. You're the one who makes me think that I'm the crazy one, huh? I think that bump on your head made you scramble your brain. - Carol, okay, I wasn't hallucinating, okay. I wasn't thinking over another woman. I saw her, she was on top of me. - Get the fuck out of here! - You know what? Fine. - Do you wanna have some breakfast? - Not hungry. Okay. I have a lot to do today. You could maybe help me out. Take your mind off some of the things that are bothering you. There's trees to trim, there's yard trash to be taken out, sweeping, you can fold up some of those boxes. - I have some unpacking to do. - Just do something constructive. I'm going out. - Somebody woke up with a stick in their ass this morning. - Zoe, that's not a nice thing to say. - Well, it's true. - He's your father. You have to respect him. - Whatever. - Can I help you? - Actually, I'm here to help you. Please listen to me. - Are you a Jehovah's Witness or trying to sell me something here? - No, no no no no. It's nothing like that, please. - Well I don't mind telling you it's a bit weird just seeing you pull up in my driveway like this. - I know, please listen. I know this is gonna sound crazy, but you and your family are in mortal danger. You need to get your wife, your kid... - Wait a minute. You're that crazy lady who came here the other day, to tell my buddy he shouldn't have sold me this place, right? - Look, whatever Teddy told you, I am not crazy, and he knows what happened in this house. He knows it should have been burnt to the ground. You need to leave. - Are you threatening me? - No, I'm not. Listen. - What's going on here? I'm Carol Harrison, and you are? - My name is Donna MacCready. I'm here to warn you you're in grave danger. You need to take your children, especially the youngest one. She's in the worst danger. - What do you mean? - You just need to leave this house, and go back where you came from. - I want you to get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here now. - Please listen to what I'm saying. I'm gonna go, okay, but I'll give you my card. It's got my cell, my home, you call me anytime, night or day. - Go now. - Please listen to what I've said. I am not the enemy here. I'm trying to help your family. I'm going. Please remember what I said. - Alyssa, Zoe. Will one of you go get the dog? - Damn it. - Oh my God. - Mom, I heard you screaming. What's up? - Whatever you do, stay inside. - What's going on? - Just stay inside. What have you done? What have you done? You killed our dog! - Oh my God. - Let's go. Run for the car. - Oh my God. - Ben. - Oh my God. - Thank you so much for meeting me. - I'm so glad you called. - I didn't know what else to do. I couldn't call the police. He's still my husband. - Let's hope he still is. - What's that supposed to mean? - How much do you know about the house that you're living in? - Other than thinking that we totally got gyped by Teddy, not too much. - Yeah, you're talking about Teddy Corbett. He's been trying to unload that place unsuccessfully for years until you and your husband came to town. Everybody knows what happened there with the orphan murders, and... - Murders? - Did you ever hear about the infamous orphan murders? Couple of filmmakers have been coming to town trying to make a movie about it for years. - Yeah, I heard about them, but I thought that was somewhere up north. - No, it happened in the house that you and your family are living in. - What? - It's not the only bad thing that happened there. If I knew then what I know now, I... - What all happened? - It's all in here. All of it. - Carrington Orphanage. - Yeah, so the house has gone through reconstruction and renovation, but it was built in the early 1800s by a man named Paul Corbett and his wife Hester. - Teddy's ancestors. - One in the same. I mean, the facts have been obscured over the years. Not sure exactly what happened, but something really terrible happened in that house between Hester and her husband Paul. So no one really knows what happened one night, but Paul and Hester got into an awful fight, and Paul left in the middle of the night, was never seen or heard from, and Hester hung herself in the basement. - What? Oh my God. - So, legend has it that Hester placed a curse on anybody that spends any time in that house. I mean, whether you believe in that kind of thing, but I am telling you nobody that has spent any time in that house has come to a good end. Everybody has been affected by that curse. - But, yet, here you are. You seem to have escaped the so-called curse. - Yeah, well, maybe I haven't. - My daughter Alyssa. - The youngest one? - She's been drawing pictures of things that you've described, and things since. - Like what? - Here's something for your scrap book. - Oh my God. - Oh my God. - What is this? It's awful. - Oh my God. Oh my God, we gotta go. Oh, oh. Girls, we're going. - Hello. Who's there? - Hey stranger. Wanna come in and wash my back? I'm not mad. What don't you come in? We'll work it out. - What the fuck? Ben, why are you calling me? - I need to talk to you. It's important. - It's very late. - I know, okay. I wouldn't have called you if this wasn't important. - Where's Carol? - She left. - Why? Did you tell her about us? - No, something else. I need you to come see me. - Look, I don't think that's a good idea. - Joan, please. This is important, okay. I want you to come see me. - Fuck. - Hello. Are you still there? - Yeah, I'm still here. Look, what happened with us in the past was a huge mistake. - Look, okay, we've been through this before. It has nothing to do about that. I'm in a bind here, okay. I need you to come see me. - Why don't you call Teddy? You know he's still your best friend. - No, he wouldn't understand. Please. - Okay. But I don't wanna hear about the past, and I don't want you starting anything new, or else I'm leaving immediately. You understand? - I understand. I promise nothing like that will happen. - I'll see you in a little bit. Fuck. Ben. Ben, it's me. Joan. Let me in. Ben. Are you gonna let me in, or are you just gonna let me drown out here? - Yeah, come on in. - So? What's this all about? You got me here, don't leave me in suspense. - It's in the kitchen. Let me show you. - Oh, what the hell, Ben? Why are the lights off in this place? - It's on the counter. Alyssa drew those. She drew that one today. She knows things are gonna happen before they do, somehow. - Before they do somehow? - Why are you doing this to me? I know what you want me to do. If I do this, do you promise all the bad thoughts will go away? - Comin'. Slow your damn roll. Who is it? - It's me, Ben. Open up, man. Something terrible has happened. - Jesus. Get in here, man. What the hell happened? Was there an accident? - Sort of. - Wait here, I'm gonna get an ambulance. - No. No doctors, no cops. - Ben, wait a minute. - You're awake. Thought I'd have to get started without you. Let you give you a piece of advice, Ace. There are two things you never fuck with that belong to a man. Two things! One. A man's family. And two, is money. You screwed with both, Teddy. So... Any last words? Huh? I guess it's kinda hard to talk with that gag in your mouth, isn't it? Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I hate to break this to you, but this is gonna hurt a lot. I really hated to do that to ya. You know that, right, Teddy? Yeah. We're best friends. Best friends don't hurt each other. Huh, do they? Oh, for fuck sakes. - You fucked up my life, man. You fucked it up. You had to pay. I know about you and Joan. I was there. At the party. I saw it in that fucking car. Ben. - Ben please, what, huh? Please forgive me and Joan for fucking up your life? Huh? Is that the please you're talking about? I already took care of Joan. Now it's your turn. Revenge is a messy business, my friend. Look at all this blood. You know, I always knew you were full of shit, but, who would have thought you have this much blood in you? God damn it, it's everywhere. You brought this on yourself. You know that, right, Teddy? You mess with the bull, you're gonna get the horns. Should have done this last night. We gotta dot the Is, cross all the Ts. Isn't that right, Teddy? Can't leave any evidence behind. What do you have to say for yourself, huh? Yeah, you always were the talkative one. Here, have a drink, pal. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, my friend. No. No. No. I killed you! - Okay girls, I want you to stay in the car. We're just gonna go in for a couple minutes, but whatever you do, just stay in the car until we get back. - No, no no, Mom. We should go in with you. I mean, we should all do this together. - No, Donna and I are just gonna go in for a couple minutes. We're gonna go just check and see if your Daddy's okay. - You're gonna go storm in the house because of something Alyssa drew? It's not like she's psychic or something. - Just do as I say. Stay in the car. - All right. - We'll be right back. - Daddy's not okay. He did something very bad. He's not finished yet. - I'll get the lights. The lights aren't working. - He broke the lights out. - Okay, Carol, I don't think it's safe to be stumbling around here in the dark. We should go. - No, I've got a flash light. Just stay close to me. - Okay. We must be nuts being in here looking for him. I mean, he just viciously slaughtered your dog. - No, he's not here. Go tell the girls that they can grab a few things. Come in quickly. What's wrong? - This is where it all started, and the curse was put upon this house. - This place just creeps me out. I wish we never would've moved here. - Okay, be safe, I'm gonna go get the girls. Be careful. - Okay. I'll look for some light bulbs. - Is everything okay? - Everything's fine. Your father's not here, so it's just us girls. But the lights are out in the house, so your mom's just looking for some light bulbs. Okay, we'll get the lights going, and then... Okay, girls, just stay here all right. Just stay here. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh? What do you mean, uh-oh? - Daddy's home. - Ben, what are you doing here? What happened to you? What are you doing? Wait... No, please no. - Well, here we are. One big happy family. - What have you done? - I did what I had to do to keep this family together. And then you ran away with my little girls. Why'd you do that, Carol? Huh? Why? I thought you loved me. - I did. I do, I mean, we're family. I mean, that's what family's for. We'll support you. - Why do I need support, huh? Why? - Just don't hurt my daughters. - Why would I ever wanna hurt our little angels, huh? Do you? - Stop it! Stop it. - There he is. Ben. Oh my God. Ben, Ben honey, can you hear me? - Daddy, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, Daddy's okay, just uh... - Let's get you up. - Just clumsy. - Let's get you upstairs. - I'm glad you're okay, Daddy. - Yeah, yeah, me too, pumpkin. Just, ugh, a big old headache. Oh. What are you drawing there, baby girl? - Wanna see? - Sure. Oh, it's really good. Good job, sweetheart. - Thanks Daddy. I made one especially for you today. I'll go get it. - Okay, can't wait. Hey, you know honey, I was thinking. - About what? - About us moving. And we can still, I just... I don't think Teddy was playing straight with us about this house. We can just stop payment and explain we changed our minds. We could move to New York. Buy us an apple grove or something. - We changed our minds? Sounds like you changed your mind. Girls and I like it here. - Since when? No, really, I think moving would be for the best. I'll call Teddy here for breakfast and let him know. - I said, the girls and I like it here. Cheating bastard. - What happened? - We're going for ice cream. - Bye Ben. - Bye Dad. - Okay, let's all get in the car. - Shotgun. - Why does Zoe always get to sit in the front seat? I wanna sit up front too. - 'Cause I'm older, and you can't beat me up. - Enough arguing. It's a great day out. We are really gonna like it here.
