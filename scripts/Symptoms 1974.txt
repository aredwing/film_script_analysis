'I have a feeling that something is about to happen, 'something final in which I will be involved.' SYMPTOMS I hardly ever come to this place nowadays. I warn you, it isn't exactly comfortable. Oh, that doesn't bother me. You wait till you see inside. You might change your opinion. I don't think anything's been changed for years. Most of the other rooms are closed now. I just use the kitchen and a couple of the bedrooms. And this room, of course, which is quite enough for me. (Clock chimes) -Life again. Peace and quiet at last. You'll find plenty of that here. Just look at those clouds. Do storms frighten you? No. I remember once, in Switzerland, there was a storm in the mountains. The sky went so black, I thought the world was coming to an end. How was Switzerland? I was lonely and homesick. I was working most of the time. Technical translations are such a bore, I had to come home. Did you get my letter? No. Oh, I sent it to Geneva. No, I didn't get it. Oh. Anyway, doesn't matter now. It was a bad time for me when I broke up with John. I needed to talk to someone. Are you all right? Sudden changes in the weather always upset me. I don't know why. Have you got a headache? -No, it's all right. I'll get something from the chemist tomorrow. I'll go for you now if you like. -No. Don't leave me alone. I'll be all right in a minute. (Bath water running) I've brought you some more hangers. Thanks. More wine? -Mm. Yes, please. it's very good. Thanks. Are you enjoying it? -It's delicious. Very strange flavour. -That's why I like it. What is it? Some sort of herb? Yes. I found it in the woods nearby. I don't know the name. I just use the leaves. Here. Smell. Mm, I recognise this. This smell is all over the house. I burn it for incense. It's very sharp. Shh. Do you hear that? What? There it is again. It's the owls. I can't hear anything. Your ears are still full of soap. They are not. I can hear things nobody else can. Coffee? Yes, lovely. (Clock chimes) Who's this? -What? Oh. Cora. -Is she a relation? No, just a friend. She looks interesting. -Yes, she is. Aren't you having any? -No, it keeps me awake as it is. It's funny, I don't remember you mentioning Cora. I haven't seen her lately. The storm's getting closer. Why should we worry? We've got a roof over our head, a nice warm fire. Anne, what do you think happens after death? (Door bangs) (Indistinct hushed voices) (Girl laughing) (Door closing) Good morning. -Good morning. -It's a pleasure to see you again, Miss Ramsay. Unfortunately, I can't get down as much as I'd like to. Ah. Nick? Still working hard, are you? That'll be 30 pence, please. Thank you. And how's Miss Cora? She's fine. Do give her my kind regards. Charming young lady. Is she with you this time? Erm... no, she couldn't come. Oh. Must be a bit lonely in that bih house all on your own. Yes. Well, you're certainly looking very much better, if I may say so, Miss Ramsay. It's just these terrible headaches I keep getting. Well, those tablets ought to bring relief. -Thank you. Goodbye. -Goodbye, Miss Ramsay. (Car engine starts) (Car drives off) Morning. -Good morning. How's it going? -Fine. I couldn't find you when I got up this morning, so I wandered round the house and discovered this. It's the perfect setting for getting down to work. So here I am. -Yes, I like it too. I got up early, went down to the village. Did you find everything you need? -Oh, I only wanted a cup of coffee. By the way... you left the tap in the wash basin running. Me? -Well, who else? You should've woken me when you went to the village. I'd have liked to have gone with you. I looked in, but you were sleeping so peacefully, I didn't want to disturb you. Did you sleep well? -Mm, like a log. I suppose I must have dreamt it, but I thought I heard someone laughing during the night. Yes. You must have dreamt it. Yes, I suppose so. It's beautiful here. So peaceful. Come on, Helen. -I'm coming. What's the matter? Somebody drowned themselves here once. You brood over things too much- It's bad for you. Come on. Helen, look! Come on. Can you manage? Yes. -That's right. Now, if you sit there... Right. Can't you row at all? -I never cared to. Just as well I can. (squealing) What is it? You've gone quite pale. Did you hear that? Just a bird. -No. This one was different. Very different. I know everything that happens in these woods. Many things happen in these woods. We're going back now. (Axe chopping wood) That man, did you see his eyes? Well, I did. He never took them off you. As if he wanted to... -How disgusting. Why? It's a compliment in a way. You're probably his type. The very thought of him makes me sick. I never look, never speak to him. Who is he? -Brady, the odd-job man. Coarse, but then some women find that attractive. He disgusts me. (Indistinct hushed voices) (Flies buzzing) (Dripping) (Creaking) (Hushed voices) I like to see them burn. It calms my nerves. Well, you're not going to burn this one, because I'm going to keep it. All right. But in that case I'm going to do a really complicated one. You're not to look at me while I do it. I did a lot of paper cutting when I was convalescing. It was Cora's idea. She was always full of ideas. You'd never believe some of them. (Clock chimes) (indistinct whispering voices) (Phone rings) Hello? -'Oh, Anne? It's me, John.' John... Oh, John, you promised not to bother me. 'But, Anne, I've got to talk to you. Anne, are you still there?' I can't discuss things now. -'Anne?' Good morning. -Morning. Could I borrow your car this morning? -Yes, of course. Where are you going? -Post office. Oh. If you hang on till I get dressed, I'll take you down there myself. Don't bother. It's only going to take me a minute. Oh. All right, just as you wish. Is there anything you want from the village? No, thank you. See you later. -Goodbye. Bye. (Brady) Alone? Well, I thought I was. I didn't expect to see anyone. Seen you here before. My name's Brady. I work here. Don't suppose Miss Ramsay told you. As a matter of fact, she did. -Did she, now? Usually she pretends I don't exist. Nonsense, Mr Brady. She's told me all about you. She couldn't have done. She doesn't know anything about me. Nobody does. No more than I know about her yet. Nor you, for that matter. Well, I imagine it's impossible to know everything about someone else. You'd be surprised what you can work on, if you keep your eyes and your ears open, Miss... Didn't get your name. -Weston, Anne Weston. Thanks. I like to know who I am talking to. You're very beautiful. Much more so than the last one. Last one? Cora. Don't you know her? Oh, yes. I've seen her photograph in the house. Oh, I see. You'd never seen her before? No, never. I live in the stables at the back of the house. Yes, I know. If you need me anytime, you know then where to find me. Helen! What on earth's the matter? Helen? Helen! Why have you been so long? I came as soon as I could. Avoid that man. I don't like being spied on, especially by a friend. I wasn't spying. I was merely trying to protect you, which is different. You must never leave me again. Promise? I shall have to sometime. But I promise, I won't leave you while you're like this. Help me. But how can I, if you won't tell me anything? I... I don't know how to. Brady. This has got something to do with Brady, hasn't it? Help me. But how can I, if you won't tell me what's wrong? L... I don't understand myself. I'm ill. Then let's leave and go back to London. -No. That would be worse. It's much better being here alone with you. For how long? I can't stay here forever, you know. It won't be long now. I promise you, everything will be all right very soon. (Meaning) (Moaning continues) (Panting) (Breath quickening) (Floorboard creaks) (Moaning and panting) Helen? Helen, are you all right? Helen? Helen, open the door. I was beginning to get quite worried. I'm sorry. Do you always lock the door? -I sometimes do. Without thinking. Oh, I see. Good night. Good night. I never thought I could enjoy such laziness. You look worried. Just thinking. You're not very happy, are you? No, no, it's not that. I'm just turning a few thoughts over in my mind. Please, share them. Could there be anyone, apart from us, living in the house? Don't be silly. Surely we'd have seen them. The thing is, I have the impression that we're not alone, that there's someone else. Of course not. Now it's you who are imagining things. What's the matter? I don't give a damn if somebodys looking. Oh, it's not that. -You'd better make your apologies. Get your things and we'll drive back to town. I can't. I can't leave Helen. Why not? Surely she'll understand. -Look, John, she's not been well. She needs company. It's just for a few days more. Then I'll be able to explain things to her. Very well. But if you're not back in four days, I shall come and fetch you, and this time I won't take no for an answer. Promise? Promise. There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere. You got me quite worried. I can't be that difficult to find. Who was that? Oh, that was John. He just dropped in. You didn't introduce him. I didn't really think you'd want to meet him. (Banging) (Footsteps) (Banging) (Rapid breathing) (Meaning) (Moaning continues) (Footsteps) Helen? Helen? Helen? Helen? I know you're here. (Clatter) (Creaking) (Gasps) Oh! - (Clatter) (Footsteps) (Thud) (Footsteps) (Door closing) (Footsteps) (Floorboard creaking) (Scraping) (Creaking) (Heart beating) (Indistinct hushed voices) Miss Helen, whatever happened? Surely you never slept here all night? I don't know. Oh, come now. Well, that's nonsense. You must know whether you slept here or in your bed. I can't remember. Well, I don't know, I'm sure. I mean, you never even let me know you was coming. I'd have had things all nice and ready for you. It's all right, there's no need to worry. -Oh, yes, there is. You don't look well. And Mr Burke told me you were quite alone. Now, where's Miss Cora? Why didn't she come down with you? She couldn't come. Oh... Well, I'd better get on with my housework. Hannah, I want to ask you a favour. Yes. It's only for a few days. It's just that I... I must have complete solitude. Why, Miss Helen? I must be left absolutely alone. There's something wrong, isn't there? No. No, nothing at all. Well, what about the housework? It's all right, that can wait. I'll let you know. -Very well, Miss Helen. If you say so. I don't really understand. And I don't like leaving you a bit. I said, "I don't like the look of things." She was kind of drugged, Mr Burke. She looks far worse now than she did when she was ill. I asked her how Miss Cora was, and all she did was shrug. Hmm... Sounds to me as if they've had a quarrel. Yes, it does, and I think I know the reason too. -Oh? Brady, that nasty creature. I caught him once in the stables, with Miss Cora. Miss Cora? With a man like Brady? Saw 'em with my own eyes. I told Miss Helen that she ought to get rid of him, but she didn't. Well, perhaps she fancies him herself. There's no accounting for some tastes. Oh, no, Mr Burke, not Miss Helen. Why, she can't stand the sight of him. Well, why does she keep him on? -Now, that's just what's so funny. I think that he's got some kind of hold over her. (Phone rings) (Ringing tone) Looking for something? Or maybe it's somebody you're looking for? No. I was wondering if there wasn't something in there, in the lake. I don't know. I do, Miss. I know who you're looking for. Did you hear that sound just now? Cry? A whimper. Sound? Oh, yes, I heard it all right. Calling. Following. Yes. Cora, wasn't it? I don't know. Oh? Has something else happened, then? You can tell me. Maybe it wasn't Cora. Maybe it was the other one, Anne. I haven't see her lately. I don't know. -Then again, maybe it was both of them. Both calling you, both looking for you. (Footsteps) (Hushed female voice) (Doorbell rings) (Doorbell rings again) (Clock chimes) (Door creaking) Anne? Anne? (Thunderclap) Nice dress. You must've been expecting a visitor. Yes, you. If you hadn't come, I would have fetched you. What about giving me a drink, then? (Rumble of thunder) It's all right, it's not poisoned. I'm having the same. Cheers. Cheers. I expect you're wondering what I've come here for. I've brought you a little present. Recognise this? -No, I don't. What is it? -Go on, you can guess. I'm afraid I can't guess. It looks like hair. -It is. Human hair. I found it in the lake. You know bloody well whose it was. I found the rest of her as well. I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about. You're a cool one, all right. You'd have to be, wouldn't you? Listen, if there's something I ought to know, you'd better tell me. You know about it already. -But I don't. Do tell me. All right, then. I found her body in the lake. -Oh. Several people have been drowned there. Another drink before you go? I will. And you'd better get yourself another while you're about it. You're going to need it. Now, look, it's about time you and I got to understand each other, so listen. Drink? -All right, that can wait. Now, listen... I knew I'd find her body sooner or later. That lake is like the sea. It always gives up its dead. I watched you, you know, that day you pushed her in the water. Pushed who in? What are you talking about? Your friend, Cora. Are you suggesting that I murdered Cora by pushing her into the lake? That's absurd. You must be mad. Well, you stuck a knife in her first. I wasn't all that close, but... I recognised her body. Anyway, what about the other one, Anne? Where's she? In the lake too? You're not absolutely certain, are you? No one will be able to prove that the body is Cora. It's pretty daring of you to come, don't you think? Cora's dead. The corpse I fished out of the lake is her. No, it's not Cora. You've got a damn good line of talk. But you won't fool the law that easy, will you? So we've got to come to an understanding. We'd better arrange this between us. You've got no other choice. What is it you want? Money? What else is there for me in this house? Oh, yes, I want money. Lots of it. I've been watching you for months and waiting. And now it's time. (Thunderclaps) Cora! Cora! Cora! Cora! Cora! Cora! Cora! (Doorbell rings) (Nick) I can hear the bell ringing, but I can't see anyone coming. Maybe she's asleep. Oh, this bell can be heard in all parts of the house. It's just not normal for Miss Helen to be asleep this time of day and not hear the bell. Thought I saw somebody moving by the staircase. Not certain, though. It's difficult to see clearly. Better use your set of keys, don't you think? Go and have a look round the back at the stables. Perhaps Bradys there. (Hannah) Oh, no! No! No! Oh! Now, try and pull yourself together, Hannah. Come along. -But Miss Helen... I'm going to telephone for the police. -But Miss Helen... Just keep calm. Come along. -Where's Miss Helen? We'll have to find her. -Yes, yes, I know. Calm yourself. Go and sit down. Leave it all to me. But Miss Helen... -Just sit down. -We've got to find Miss Helen. -I know. Oh, where is she? (Burke) Hello? Police? (Dialogue indistinct) (Burke) Thank you. I couldn't find anyone in the stables. Came in through the kitchen door. Somebody must've left it open. We've found Brady's body in the living room. He's been murdered. Come with me, Nick. Stay where you are, Helen. The police will be here soon. Miss Ramsay? It's us. Your friends. We're here to help you. Miss Helen? Look at me, listen to me. It's Hannah, it's Hannah talking to you. You've... you've not been well. You've been through a bad dream... The end
