That means there's something valuable inside. Ready? There's nothing... Move. Move. I found something. What is it? Let's see. Who tied this? What, all this work for a book? Must be worth something if he was buried with it. "Rage hums its deadly song. " Ahh! There's nothing! I'll take this to Shahira. He sometimes buys old books. He's a thief. Maybe so. But his money spends the same. I get half. - Don't move. - What are you doing? All right, fine. Move. What was that? The guardian of the tomb. Guarding what? Let's go. Finally. You're late. I'm not very happy about that. It'll cost you more. Go bargain with Shahira without me. You'll do better. Bad blood. It's Shahira. Blood has nothing to do with money. - Except when it's his money. - All right, wait here. Shahira. Aladdin. You have something for me? If there were any other buyer in Vardana, I wouldn't be here. But there isn't, so we're here. So your expedition must have been profitable. Show me. Well, no jewels or gold this time. Only this. Tsk. A stained, moldy old book? How am I gonna sell this? Still, I'm sure some poor scholar would shell out a few drachmas for this. For curiosity's sake, of course. Twenty. Done. Twenty gold coins for a moldy, old book? That must be some book. It's a worthless antique. But still, there are buyers. I think I'll keep it. - Aladdin, we had a deal. - You had a deal. I'll bring it back when I finish with it. I could do with a good read. My offer might not be open then. I'll take that chance. Visma. Find me Luca. Don't bring him here to the market. Bring him to my tent. - Where's my cut? - I didn't sell it. What? Shahira agreed to 20 gold pieces. No bargaining. No haggling. Twenty gold pieces? Why didn't you take it? Think about it. If he's willing to pay what we wanted, no questions asked, this book must be the key to something valuable. All right, then let me see the book. Not here. Come on. It seems to be the description of a journey of sorts. There's even a map drawn inside the back cover. You think it'll lead us to treasure? "Seekers seek. "Granters grant. "May the desires of your heart be yours. "The stones do keep, the greatest treasure lies in deep. " The stones. The stones of Mustafa? Mustafa? Somebody went to a great deal of trouble to hide this book inside an obscure sarcophagus hidden up a mountain and guard it with a two-headed serpent. Wait, look, our markings. "A lock for which four keys are made. Each one opens the door. " Khalil and Shifa also bear these signs. Why are our markings in an ancient book? I don't know. I'm gonna ask somebody who does. If you think Khalil is going to tell you, you're mistaken. He won't talk about his past or ours. If that book has anything to do with either, he won't tell you. It's worth a try. I'll meet up with you later. Gather the men, we're going treasure-hunting. You're getting good, Shifa. If I were that good, you'd be the one pinned. Well, I'm stronger than you and I've been training longer. - Where's Luca? - Gathering men for an expedition. - I'm going with you. - No. I fight better than Luca. He drinks and gambles, a woman just has to smile for him to lose his head. - He's reliable. - I'm unreliable? - You judge too harshly. - You'll be sorry. I'll be careful. Aladdin. Welcome home. Thank you, Khalil. Was your search successful? I'm not sure. I had hoped to bring you money for the orphans. But I may have the chance at something much bigger. Something that could actually put you and them in a building that keeps the warmth in and the rain out. Well, come. Let's go inside. You're coming with us. Luca. Why didn't you come with Aladdin earlier? I wanted to see you alone - To tell you the good news. - Good. I won a few coins, I want to apply it against the debt that I owe you. Nice. Where is it? - It's right there. - Give it to me. This doesn't even put a dent in what you owe me! I need a little more time. I gave you more time, Luca. Your time is up. I'm going to take your head and put it on a pike outside my tent as a warning. Shahira, I will pay you. - Take his head off. - What...? No, wait. No. Please. No. Please don't kill me! Burn this book. Wipe it from your memory. What? Or throw it down the well. Or bury it in the deepest part of the forest where no one will ever find it again. Why? What is this? Just this once, Aladdin. Don't ask why. Trust me. Forget you ever saw this book and this map. Don't kill me. No! Wait, wait, wait. What could you possibly do for me? I'll do anything. Anything? I will do it. There is something. I can do it. Please, just spare me. You and Aladdin are close, yes? Yes, we both grew up in Khalil's orphanage. He's like a brother to me. Would you betray your own brother? Would you? No. Aladdin, I have never discouraged you from seeking your fortune. But this time I'm telling you, don't go. We're tied to this book, you know what it is and you're not saying. Our marks. Shifa, fire. Luca, earth. You, water. Me, air. If you wanna stop me walking out of here right now, then tell me what this means. It's the dark arts, isn't it? I know you still know them. And I know you know what this book is. I don't practice them anymore. The dark arts are history and so is that book. Leave it alone, Aladdin. It may be history, but it's my history. Your history is here. I have loved you as a son, ever since they left you on my doorstep. And when Shifa and Luca were abandoned, I raised them as my children too. Which is why I am begging you, forget about this book. There are other treasures to hunt. A man with no treasure is poor but he's still a man. A man without a past is no man. Aladdin, some treasures are found at too great a cost. But at least they're found. I'll do anything. Take these talisman, they have a special property. This is what you're going to do. Aladdin, I'm going with you. Stay with Khalil. He needs you here. Aah! Hey, it's good. It's for me? - No. - Hey. Start packing. But it's my turn and I'm down 40 coins. Unless you'd like to play. No, thanks. Luca doesn't want to play? - Why not? - We'll play with anyone. Even the grandson of a Roman. My grandfather is twice the man you are. Then why did he allow himself to be captured? And made a slave? I thought Roman soldiers were bred to be brave. That's enough. Put your knives down, both of you. There's no time. We must leave before the sun sets. Save your fighting for later. A great treasure awaits. - Gold coins? - Bigger. - Silver chalice? - The stones of Mustafa. The fabled jewels King Mustafa used to purchase the kingdom from the gods. But I thought this was just a myth. If you're not interested... No, no, no, we're interested. We are interested. Come on. Luca, whatever the trouble with Hassan, - don't bring it on the trip. - He thinks he's better than me. That will never change. - Where are we going? - Mount Dinai. Dinai? Take days, in the worst country in the world. Afraid? I'm not afraid of anything. Then let's get started. Keep your eyes open for anything suspicious. I don't wanna have come this far to get our throats slit. Abdel. All there is here is rocks. We haven't seen what's at the top yet. According to the map, the only way is up. I hope they find those stones before dark. I don't relish having to spend the night here. Stop complaining. Almost there. What are we looking for? I can't tell. The map shows a river. There must have been one here long ago. Ready? What's taking them so long? If it was anybody but Aladdin, I'd be afraid they took off with the jewels and left us. He's too honest. Every cent he makes, he squanders on that orphanage. You were raised in that orphanage too, Luca. Meaning what? Maybe you owe Khalil something too? Keep talking, Abdullah. I'll cut that tongue out of your throat. Oh, really? Not now, enough. Enough. We're going to find those jewels and go our separate ways. I'm tired of listening to us fight. All we ever do is fight. When I get home, I wish to find a woman who never speaks and makes love like an animal. Spend the rest of my days in her bed. "The rage was buried "in a watery grave. No glint to be seen again. " What does that mean? Well, the river is long gone. Whatever treasure existed here must have been buried in the water. What kind of treasure is rage? We won't know if we don't find it. - You sure we want it? - You sure you don't? Where do we start digging? A glint buried in the water. Look out! Get down. Is that it? Well, it belongs to us now. Stay back. What on earth...? Come on. Aah! What do you want? Abdel. - Aladdin came to see me today. - I cannot control who he sees. - Trying to sell me a book. - He sells lots of things. A very old book. What is your business, Shahira? You know what my business is. And soon Aladdin will know as well. And your secret is about to be revealed. You know he won't give up now that he knows he's on to something. Ha, ha. Like a dog to a bone, that one. Let it lie, Shahira. No good can come out of the truth now. I want that book, Khalil, and no man or no magic will stop me from getting that book. Help, Luca! - Aladdin. - Abdel is dead. I unleashed some sort of demon and it killed him. I couldn't stop it and I don't know where it is. Demon? What do you mean? - Where is Hassan? - He went into the woods. We have to find him. No one should be alone out there. Whoa. We go that way. - Hassan? - Hassan! Where are you? Hassan, stop fooling around. Hassan! Hassan! - Hassan! - Hassan! Hassan! Hassan! What do you want from us? No. Let's go. We gotta grab our stuff and get out of here before it kills anybody else. Hurry. Let's get going. I wanna be far away from this place before the sun sets. Not so fast. Packing so soon? You must have... You found it. I've been searching for it for so long. And you come in with this book, leading me straight to it. All I had to do was follow you. Let you do all the work. Ha-ha-ha. Did you rub the lamp? Have you? You fool! You have, haven't you? You've released the Jinn. Still, not all is lost. Give me the lamp. Luca, bring me the lamp and your debt is paid. Have you changed your mind? "I'll do what you want. I'll do anything. " Isn't that what you said? You betrayed me. He was going to kill me. There was a knife at my throat. I didn't have a choice. You always have a choice. Bring me the lamp. Oh, Khalil. Was this your doing? It looked like you needed it. I knew Shahira would follow you. They robbed us. - Of what? - An old lamp I found. Oh, by the gods. I was looking for the stones of Mustafa. I should've told you what the book was pointing to. It didn't point to stones, only a traitor. - I didn't have a choice. - He's right. He didn't. And neither did you. I can see that now. We're all fulfilling our destinies. What are you talking about? What Luca did was wrong, but the trail he left for Shahira was how I was able to find you. So some good came out of his treachery. But I too am to blame. I tried to protect you from your past, to shield you from the dangers of your destiny. What destiny? I realize now it's impossible. We must move before Shahira's men return. A little magic won't keep them away for long. Khalil will be protecting them. He once practiced the dark arts. We need to keep them close. But for now, I have the lamp. I want to see what it can do. Jinn. Jinn. Wait. I wish for my tent. I wish for my pipe. I wish for the finest wines. Back off, it's mine. Get me some wood for the fire. And you, go get me Luca. We're not safe whilst that thing is still on the loose. It's a Jinn. They're sun demons. When the sun fades from the sky, their energies fade as well and they vanish. I thought Jinns were supposed to grant wishes. Bring their masters wealth and power. Years ago, sorcerers used to summon Jinns to be their servants. But soon they learned how dangerous that could be. Surely, if they grant wishes, then owning one would be worth any difficulty. They're powerful, and it's too easy to lose control over them. If that happens, they can kill. But even worse, Jinns learned they had free will, so they began granting wishes only to those whose greed would cause their own demise. So they could feed on their souls. In other words, be careful what you wish for. Very careful. I've unleashed a great evil into this world. The book says something about a ring of souls. The only way to regain control of the Jinns is to have the lamp and the ring of souls. The lamp releases the Jinn and the ring enslaves it. A ring? Where is it? You're still holding back what you know, old man. It's time for you to tell us. Out with it. I was apprentice to the sorcerers who banished the Jinn. One was your father, Aladdin. Another was Luca's father. And the third, Shifa's father. All who belonged to the sect were given the mark of the elements. That's how I was able to recognize you when they left you on the doorstep. We are the only four left of those that banished the Jinn. The descendants of those who were able to open the gates and send them all to hell. Your fathers worked to banish the Jinn. I wish you back into the lamp. I was left in Vardana, as I was only an apprentice, not yet accomplished enough to join in the fight. They never returned from the battle, but neither did the Jinns. I thought they had been successful until you showed me this book. And if one of them is free, you can be sure it will try to free its brothers. This is all my fault. If it weren't for me, we wouldn't be in this mess. - Luca. - No. If I hadn't owed Shahira, he wouldn't have the lamp. Luca. Let him go. Good to see you again, Luca. You don't know what you have. I have everything. Everything I want. Where are your friends going? Shahira, listen to me. What are they up to? You think you can control it, but you can't. You can't control it. Watch me. Jinn, I wish you to kill him. No, no. - Kill him now! - No! Kill him now! Why is he leaving? It's a sun creature, Shahira, it lives by the sun. Well, I don't. Mark my word. I'll slit you head to toe if you don't tell me where your friends are going. And then I'll kill your friends, Luca. Shifa. Aladdin. Khalil. I'll slaughter them like pigs. The ring. They're after the ring. What ring? If you have the lamp and the ring, you can control the Jinn. You can get it back into the lamp. Without it, you have nothing. The Jinn is granting wishes because it wants the ring, or it wants to suck on a soul. It feeds on souls, Shahira. It won't have any trouble eating yours. If that's true, why didn't it suck your soul? Because I had the mark. - It is in my blood. - You're lying. It is in my blood. You know as well as I that our fathers banished the Jinns, they closed the portal. And we are the only ones who can open it. The Jinn knows this. You're lying. You wished it to kill me, didn't you? Well, here I am. If your friends get the ring, it will banish the Jinns forever. But if I have the ring, I can open the portal and control a thousand Jinns. Shahira, the Jinn is using you. Get me the ring, Luca, or I will kill you all. I will filet you like fish. And you know I will. Now, go. Luca. Remember, I'm watching you. Then we must find it and banish the Jinn back into the lamp. That is not as easy as it sounds. The ring vanished with your parents. Well, what does the book say? According to the book, Varvak is the resting place of the ring. Varvak? The island? That place is cursed. And now you know why. Shahira must know the legend of the Jinn. Or he'd never have followed you. He can't be far behind. We must find this ring before he does and banish this creature back into hell before it frees the others. Come on, the night is young. Let's move while we still can. This island is no different than any other island. I am sure the creature will follow us here, if it hasn't already. If a Jinn can be injured, can it be killed? It's not really alive, not in the sense you and I know. So it can't be killed. Any injury you inflict will be healed by the sun. Harm it and you may buy some time, but nothing more. My arms are killing me from the rope. Stop your complaining. They feel like they're going to fall off. Well, maybe I should cut them off and put you out of your misery. I'm too old for this. You hear me? I'm getting older with each passing step. They can't be far. Come, let's go. There is the boat. There. Oh! They've landed on the other side of the island. Let's go. A warning. The Jinn can see into your hearts. It will lull you and tempt you into wishing for something. Do not give in to this demon. It will have terrible consequences. Khalil, look. "The last bed of man holds the key. It is seen through the proof of the bravery of the bravest. " What does that mean? The last bed of man. Is there a cemetery on Varvak? If you're looking for proof of bravery of the bravest, it's a good place to start. You're one to speak of bravery, huh, Luca? Shahira can vouch for yours. Let's not argue. Let's look for the cemetery. We've lost them. Go scout around. Don't come back until you pick up their trail. What are you waiting for? Get moving. You stay with me, in case I need protection. He stuffs his fat face while we do the work. He's the master. Just because he has more money, he's no smarter or stronger than we. - That's the way of the world. - Way of the world. Oh, my God. I am exhausted. - Sit, sit. Just for a moment. - No. I go this way, you go that way. This way, that way. Everybody gives me orders. Just a few moments. I wish I could lie here forever. No. No. - Heavy? - Very. Perhaps I can help. I'm just too old to be running around the countryside. Unless, Khalil, you have a fountain of youth on you? I'm afraid that's a little beyond my magic. - Give me one of these. - Ah, many thanks. But I wish I were as light and strong as when I was a boy. Ah. Ah. Don't rest too long or you'll never catch up. Don't worry, I don't want to be stuck out here all alone. Babak! No! No! Get away. I know about you, and that trick. Khalil warned us. You want to trick me? I wish I were young and strong. Babak! Hadar! What's taking them so long? They're not worth waiting for. Wait. Abdullah! He's probably sleeping. You should never have left him. Ugh. I'll go get him. Here I am. Here, let me take those for you, old man. Well, what are we waiting for? Haven't you rested long enough? Abdullah, what happened to you? I'm afraid Khalil gave us some very bad advice. Your hair is black as coal. It's all a question of phrasing your wish correctly. Your wish. You met a Jinn. - Yes. - No. And he gave me my wish. So there have been wishes in the past that didn't work. Blame the stupid masters, not the Jinn. They were brought here to serve. What did you wish for? Look at me. Idiot. What exactly did you wish for? I wished to be young. And strong. It seems to have come true. And to be 30 pounds lighter. What is it? Damn you! I'll imprison you once again. I swear it! Time to go. The cemetery. Now what? Looks can be deceiving. Khalil, what do we do now? "The seeker shall be guided by fire. " There's no fire here. The proof of the bravery of the bravest is supposed to guide us by fire. What does that mean? We're looking for proof of bravery? One thing leads to another. Yeah, maybe it doesn't. Why all these puzzles? I would think the harder it is to find the ring, the harder it is to gain control of the Jinn. The final resting place of Prince Jareb. - Who is that? - A prince of the realm. Whatever it is we're looking for, we'll find it inside. There's nothing written on it. Well, what do we do now? It bears Shifa's fire sign. Khalil, can you read it? "The temple of Maghreb bears the wrath of damnation. " What does that mean? It's showing us the way from this world into hell. And back again. That bears the mark. I see it now. The Jinn allowed us to follow these clues. So that we would find the door to hell. So that will release the Jinns that were banished there. Then why did he kill Hassan and Abdullah? Because they didn't wear the mark. One of our sect must undo the spell. It needs one of us to wish the portal open. But we're gonna do just the opposite. We must hurry to Maghreb. Come on. Ha! They found something. They must be getting close. They may have the ring, but without the lamp, it's useless. If this is our destiny, let's go and meet it. When was the temple abandoned? From the time before my great-great-grandfather. The doorway to hell. It's just a frame. The portal is shut. But under the proper conditions, it becomes very real indeed. "The circle will be broken when the four elements meet. " Well, it must be hidden. This is the only circle in here. It's a warning to leave before there's no chance left. A warning means there's something to be found. The circle will be broken when the four elements meet. - The four elements, our markings. - Right. We're here, nothing's happening. I'm afraid a spell this strong takes more than just our presence. It calls for blood. Come. Luca. Luca. - We have a deal. - Shahira. For the sake of the world, give us the lamp. No! Do you think I'd come this far to give everything up? Luca, if we join forces, there's more than enough power for both of us. More than you've ever dreamed. If we'll open the portal, we can have a Jinn each. One hundred Jinns. Think of it. A life of unlimited luxury. - Stop. - Luca. This is not a earthly treasure. With a Jinn, there's no limit to what we can do and own. Join me. Jinn, if you give me the ring, I will open the portal for you. It won't work, Shahira. The portal can only be opened by one who bears the mark. That's why the Jinn won't harm us. Then I wish for the mark. Didn't quite think it would work like this, did you, old man? Luca, we have bargained before. We have a piece of the prize. We can bargain again. It's not too late. Shahira, give me the lamp so the creature can be wished back into hell. Why would I do that? Because it will kill you as well. You cannot win this! Liar! You want it to serve you! To make you all powerful! Kill it! Kill it. Kill it. Please! Let's get out of here. It's growing powerful, thanks to the souls it's consuming. Luca, wish it back in the lamp. - What are you doing? - I was gonna wish it back. - Then do it. - I said, I was going to. Shahira said something smart. Shahira is dead. It shows you how smart he is. But he was right about one thing. There's more than enough power here for all of us. Luca, no. Just wish the Jinn imprisoned once more. If you don't wanna make the wish, I'll do it. If the temptation is so great, how do we know we can trust any of us? I think I found my own destiny. I'm smart enough to make my own future. Stop! No. Aladdin, don't. I command you now. See? It's my servant. Just waiting to do whatever I ask. Luca, I raised you as my son. I beg of you. Don't. Take me away from here. And I wish for you never to tell me what to do again. Khalil. Khalil, my father. - Khalil. - My father! - Khalil, my father. - No! Where is it? Luca! I'll kill you! I can wish for anything, can't I? You can't play any tricks with me. I've got the ring and the lamp. You have got to give me everything I want and how I want it. All right. I wish... I wish... I wish for some food. Hey. Hey! What good is a servant if he disappears with the sun? Right. Right. Tonight, we say goodbye to the only father that we have ever known. Khalil dedicated his life to us. He taught me everything I know. Me too. There seemed to be no end to his wisdom... His kindness. What will we tell them back at the orphanage? We tell them he died a brave and honorable death. No man can wish for more. But we're not gonna dishonor him by giving in to grief. We're gonna find that demon and send it back to hell. The Jinn believes it has what he was after. It doesn't need us, it won't hesitate to kill us. Damn Luca and his treachery. He hasn't wished the portal open yet. He can't, until morning. Maybe we can find him, reason with him, appeal to his good side. What makes you think he has one? Aladdin. It's my fault. Luca didn't kill Khalil, I did. What are you saying? Some treasures are found at too great a cost. But we can't just give up. We can't just walk away. We have to go and find Luca before it's too late. - It already is. - No. You saw that thing. You know what it's capable of. - We're finished! - No. You said to Khalil that a man is not a man without a past. Well, I say nor is he one without a future. Luca will not give up without a fight. But I won't stop until it's done. Go ahead, great Aladdin, run. I'll finish this without you. Shifa. If it's a fight he wants... then fight him we will. Damn you. You must never leave me! I'm starving. I wish for food. It's amazing. Amazing. I smell food. He's close. Mm. I'm stuffed. I've never eaten so much in my life. That fat pig. Where's the Jinn? I don't know. But now's our chance. Damn you, Shahira. Please don't kill me. If you won't kill me, grant me a wish. I want money. A lot of it. I wish I was showered in gold. I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich! Salaam, brother Luca. Salaam, Aladdin. We need to speak. I'm always willing to speak to you. But I warn you. I'm not going to change my mind. Luca, I fear you don't realize what you're doing. You're about to unleash a horrible force. No, it's only horrible if you can't control it. I intend to control it. Your control already killed Khalil. Khalil's dead? That's not what I wished for. You wished he would never tell you what to do again. No. No, that's not what I meant. No, no, no! That's not what I meant! The creature stopped his breathing. Don't you see? With every wish you make, you run the risk of destroying everything. Well, I made a mistake. I'll be more careful in the future. Please. For all the years we've spent together, give me the ring and the lamp. No. Luca. Stop! Shifa... bring me the lamp. Bring me the lamp, Shifa. Or... I'll wish that Aladdin never existed. Now. Don't hurt him. Don't hurt either of them. So this was all a trick, huh? You were gonna pull the wool over stupid Luca's eyes? You think I don't know what they say about me? You think I don't know they say, "Poor Luca. " "He's nothing like Aladdin. " "He's just the grandson of a poor Roman slave. He will never be as smart or as brave as one of you!" Well, those days are over. Jinn. I wish... Luca. I wish... No. Jinn, I wish for more power than any man has had before. I wish... I wish... for the power of one Jinn times a thousand! What have you done? You've opened the portal. You wished for a thousand Jinns. That's the only way for that wish to come true. You saw me command one Jinn. Now, see when I command a thousand. You win, Luca. Shifa. Face it, Aladdin. Luca is our new master. I'll give you anything you want. Everything you wish for. How can you say that when a wish killed Khalil? I wish he wasn't dead. Let me try to make it up to you. Nothing will replace him. I would never harm either you or Aladdin. You two are the people that I'm closest to. I want to believe you. Shifa, don't listen to him. Let her make up her own mind! Aladdin, there's no point in fighting anymore. Just accept it. Smart girl. Let me give you a taste of what life is gonna be like. Jinn, I wish for Shifa to be dressed in the finest silks. We were wrong about you. So now there are two traitors to Khalil's memory. If you can't join us, leave us. Aladdin is too obstinate for his own good. He's probably at the temple now trying to close the portal. He doesn't have the ring. He doesn't have the lamp. He's powerless. No. Never underestimate Aladdin. We don't need him, Luca. We can go anywhere we want. We can do anything we want. Just... think of it. No more robbing graves to eat. Anything you ever imagined could be yours. You have all the power. Aladdin is nothing, forget him. For years, I lived in his shadow. Robbing a few graves is nothing compared to what you've done. You really think so? I know so, Luca. People will not speak of the great Aladdin again. Parents will tell their children of the great Luca. They will speak of instinct. They will speak of cunning. They will speak of power. My instinct tells me I must stop him, Shifa. I've come too far to have him take that power away from me. If he closes the portal, it's over, I have nothing. You know, with one Jinn, you can conjure up a meal. But with a thousand, you can have the world. He's like a brother, Luca. Don't hurt him. I have little choice, Shifa. Jinn. Take us to Maghreb. There must be some way to stop this! Aladdin! No. Don't hurt him. You've opened the portal. You're about to bring a thousand of these monsters. Is that how you wanna be known? King of the demons? Doesn't that make you one? Silence! Do you really believe this beast will remain your humble servant? It has no choice. It must obey me. Obey? Obey you? Like it obeyed Shahira? Hassan? Abdullah? They didn't know how to wish the right way. There is no right way. Khalil! - You're alive. - I woke up. I found myself wandering in the forest. I remember, he wished you weren't dead. So your two accidental wishes canceled each other out. Give me the lamp and the ring. Let me end this once and for all. Traitor. - No. - Stop. - Shifa! - No. Don't kill her. I command you to stop. It is my wish. Take me instead! Luca, throw me the ring and I'll wish it to stop. You no longer have the lamp. You have no control over it. Stand back, my son. Waters from heaven, come down! I wish you to release her. And I wish that you do not harm any of us. We must hurry. Come. Come. Come. I wish the portal to hell to close now. Luca! Luca! No! Earthly steel has no effect on them. I'm trying! Luca. Luca! - I'm sorry, Aladdin. - Don't give up! Luca. Luca! No! - I deserve this! - No! Let me go! Luca! I'll send you to that infernal place where you belong. I wish you back in the lamp. Shifa. Shifa. - Aladdin, let me go. - Never. You'll be dragged in too! Let go. No! Ah! Here. Strike as hard as you can. Die! Die! Die! It's useless on its own. Keep it as a witness of this day. Aladdin, did you really think I'd gone over to Luca's side? No, I recognized it as a trick to get to the lamp. You've proven yourself to be a great fighter. I want you to come with me on my next expedition. You're starting a new expedition already? Well, I've had enough adventure for a while. Perhaps I'll just take a job in town. Oh, you'll be back treasure-hunting in a month. Heh. You're right. I nearly gave in there. I could feel the temptation. I saw. But I realized the one thing worse than a wish unfulfilled. A wish granted. Ah.
