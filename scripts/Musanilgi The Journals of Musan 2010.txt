I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord." And you forgave the guilt of my sin. It was Iike the Iast words of Jesus. Jesus Christ said to his disciples, Love each other deeply. Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. There is a peace that lies beyond the storm. There is a song that wakes the morn. There is a place where hope is born, near to the heart of Jesus.

You have a drink. Damn those sons of bitches! What have they done? They're sending South Korean propaganda leaflets to North again! What's wrong with that? Keeping back reunification. North Korea sends leaflets to South, too. But you know, speaking iII of Kim Jong-II, onIy makes things worse. - He's done no good either. - Hello? Yes, auntie. Yes, hold on. Upset Kim Jong-II and he'II take it out on our famiIy Ieft in North Korea. What are you saying? Wait... What? unzze go: caught? What about the money? Did he send the money? How can you not know? If the money is not sent, l'm a dead man! Aunt, listen very carefully and do as I say. If anybody calls asking for uncle, say you know nothing. And when you get in touch with uncle, tell him to call me no matter what. Just do as I say! Dia you ge: ir? Seung-Chul. Yes? - What's wrong? - Do you have money? - No, dem. - Lefs go to us. Something's wrong. My uncle in China got caught by the Police. I sent him $25,000 other guys entrusted me with but can't reach him. I told you not to do t. What are you going to do? Let's go to the us. Those guys wiII kiII me How much did you take? You don't beIieve me? I get nothing. I introduced them to my uncle for his sake. If you didn't take any money, why run away to us? Will they believe me? I sent all the money to uncle but can't reach him? If you run away this becomes a real fraud. I can leave by myself. But I can't leave you behind. They wiII kill you, too. What do you mean by that? Who else you know except me? They'll be suspicious of you. Should We talk to the detective PARK? If that oId man knows, I'II onIy end up in jaiI. There's no choice.

In North Korea, after Kim ll-Sung died, the food crisis got rapidly worse from 1995. Many starved to death, and more people tried to escape. South Korea is a warmer place.

What's your uncle's name who got caught in China? - My uncle in China? - Yeah. His name is JANG Tae-Soo. - JANG Tae-Soo. - Yes. Are you home? What brought you home so early? Look, Seung-Chul. Come here. This is Jack DanieI's, an American Iiquor. Let's just relax and have a drink. Did you get in touch with your uncle? Things will work out fine. Don't worry. Get out of my room. You got this for yourself, not for me. What's wrong with you? What's with the temper! Are you out of your mind? That does it. I'm tired. It's just this situation I am in. You don't care about me, you only care about your fucking dog! - Fucking dog! - What are you doing? Fuck! Oh, I got it. Now you are looking down on me, aren't you? - Aren't you? - What's wrong with you? You think l'm nothing. You see me in this situation, and look down on me. You've been begging me for clothes and now you don't need me anymore? Take all these. Take them all! I'm so tired! Get out of here! Hey, Seung-Chul. You know why you're alone? Huh? Do you know why you're alone? You fucker! You know why you're alone? You only care about yourself. That's why you have no friend. That's why you have a dog to cuddle, you doglike bastard! What dia you just say? - Hey... - Get off me! Look at yourself. You are a damn beggar! Shut up! - Shut up. - Don't taIk Iike that! Chatter to your fucking dog. I don't need it! You got that? - Fuck off! - Don't talk like that! Fuck off! Fuck! Got it? Fuck off. You... Motherfuckerl Told you to be out of my sight. Hands off! I told you! Huh? So many times! I told you! Many times! Do I sound like a fucking joke? Afucking joke? Give me some water. Hey, give me water. No, it can't be. We got this at a high price. This is definitely a crossbreed dog. - Supposed to be a Jindo or a Pungsan. - Probably a crossbreed of the tvvo. If a Jindo or Pungsan, it's fine but a crossbreed can't be sold. - Is that so? - Yes. - How about for just $20? - l'm sorry. Crossbreed dogs are not for sale. - Then, take it forjust $10. - Oh, you can't beg for this. Keeping this dog would be already a burden to us. AIright. Good bye. One of my best friends... asked me to lend him money, knowing that l'm not well off. So I did and he said he'd pay back. But then I heard from him again asking for even more money. In my mind, I thought... 'No, I don't want to.' But I couIdn't say it. Instead I said yes. Looking at myselfl became skeptical on Why I should live like this. My family used to be very rich. We used to live in a house with a big garden. But things went bad during the IMF crisis. Still, Ithought... my dad would stay strong just as he had been. But when we were about to clear out some stuffs, he got so upset asking why we have to get rid of his belongings. Seung-ChuI! Where are you going? Let's welcome a new brother, JEON Seung-Chul. Would you please introduce yourself? Come, introduce yourself. He got out of the resettlement center recently. So... He needs to adjust to our society and make some friends. That's why I brought him here. l'd appreciate your kindness. PIease don't misunderstand them. This is Detective Park and brother Seung-ChuI next to him is a North Korean defector. Brother, since we are having a prayer meeting now, would you like to suggest a topic for prayers? I don't know how to pray. IS that so? But t is not that difficult, you knoW. Tell the Lord what's on your mind, and that is prayer. Then, our Lord will understand and listen to everything you say. I am a North Korean defector. I was born in Musan, North Hamgyong province. There was nothing to eat. I was so hungry that I had a fight. I hit on and on and found my friend down. I came home with corn. The next day, I was passing the same way and that friend was still lying there. And the next day, and the day after... I killed a man. What are you saying? We just listened to Seung-Chul's painful story. He was so desperate for food he accidentally took the life of another. However, we believe that Lord who knows his circumstances will forgive his sins and offences and allow him a new life. Let us understand his pains as if they were ours and pray together for God's grace so that he... can live a new life here within God. Let's pray together. God our Father of love and grace, we have heard our brother Seung-Chul's painful story today. Thank you Lord for leading him in his pain to attend this prayer meeting. Please forgive all his sins and offences he has confessed today... Are you weary, are you heavy hearted? Tell t to Jesus, tell t to Jesus. Are you grieving overjoys departed? TeII it to Jesus aIone. What dia you e:hem that story for? Who wouId want to be friends with a kiIIer? You're so pathetic. I have no friends anyvvay. How can you live this world Without a friend? Are you serious? Detective Park. Can I have a word with you? Looks like you worry about Seung-Chul, we have programs for defectors in church... Seung-Chul. I am sorry. I really had no idea. And I am sorry. I think I can understand. Working at a karaoke because of a sick father. And you being a defector. These are things that none of us can choose. At least you confessed n front of God. I can't do that. PIease come back to work. It's too much for me alone. Please help. You like to sing hymns, don't you? You should join the church choir. Can we be friends? Friends from church? Can we? Did you make up your mind? Ah... Well, my uncle in China just started working as a broker. Yep. So ifl ask him a favor, you'Il probably get a 10% discount on the average 40% commission. Yep, yep. How much money did you want to send last time? For that amount, it's better to send it at once. Yeah, that's right. Where S Baek-Gu? Where's the dog? Yeah, yeah. Where is the dog? You crazy bastard! Why do you ask me about your dog? Lt was at home. Where would it go? Don't you believe me? How can I beIieve a thief and crook? Where is the dog? Huh? I Iet it Ioose. Because I felt sorry for the dog becoming a loser like you. - Man... - So I Iet it Ioose. What? Where did you leave it? Where? That fucking dog must have a place it wants to go to. Kyung-Chul.
