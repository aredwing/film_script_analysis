Then go and look for it! Scream and you're dead. Adele? Adele! Adele! - What are you doing in there? - Nothing. Go and do the milking. I'll just get changed. Why are the police officers here? There's been a fire at the prison. Someone has escaped. Why was he in prison? It seems he'd killed his father. I've got to get out of here. That's not possible now. My parents are home. I need some clothes. No one comes here. There's something in it. Glass. Remove it. I can't get it out like this. It's too deep. I'll get it out. Tomorrow I'll bring you to the next town where our milk is taken to. There are lorries there that you can make your way with. Long-distance traffic. But you have to do something for me in return. When we get there... and you're in safety... I want you to push me off a cliff. I've tried to jump but I can't manage it on my own. I only need a push. I know you've already killed somebody. If you don't do it, I'll get the police. Get it out. Hello Adele. I haven't seen you in ages. Are you well? I've been meaning to come by, but you know how things are. Have you found someone to help out? Can I ride along? Of course, get in. I only know the way up to here. You have to do it now. I'll show you a cliff near by. Shall we go? Shall we go? You have to do it now. We'll do it here. What are you doing? I don't want it like that. It's this or nothing. We have to find a cliff. It's this or nothing. How exactly? It won't hurt. How do you know? Do you want it or not? Yes. Open your mouth. So you don't shout. We have to go! Come on! Get in the truck. Come on! - Get on with it! - You go first. Where do you think you're going? I'm going to the police... You lied to me... You won't do it. You have to come overthe border with me. They won't find me so easily in France. I'll do it when we get there. Why do you want me to do it? It will be better. Better than what? Better than here. Why do you suppose there's anything there? What if there's nothing? That's actually how it is. There's nothing. How would you know? Hello. Are you looking for someone? - My mother's supposed to pick me up. - Here, on the road? She'll be here in a moment. Have you hurt yourself? I fell but it doesn't hurt. Do you want to come in? You can wash your hands and call your mother. Come. Come on. The phone is over there, next to the chair. Hello, Markus. It's me. Has Mama already left? - Who is that? - She's just calling her mother. Okay... yes. Bye. My mother isjust coming. You can wait here. I have to go. Are you sure? We have to get out of here. Don't sneak up like that! I only wanted the T-shirt. What T-shirt? The red one with the writing... my brother's one. Why? I'd like to have it. Is your brother five or what? He's dead. Why is he dead? Because we had an accident. We were riding a moped at night. A car crashed into us. Did he die at once? - Yes. - And you? I was in a coma for several days. How old was he? Sixteen. I bought a moped at the age of sixteen. And left home on it. Since then I've never asked anyone for anything. Why did you leave? Because I didn't like it there. Do you have siblings? I have no family. Can you shut it now! All right. - Take that off. - What? I told you to take that off! - Take it off! - Shut it! Go and drink. Go on, who knows when we'll get water again? Get off me! It's all right now. Hello. Hello. Where are you going to? - Are you lost? - Yes. This way! Hannelore, you're our saviour - Who are those two? - They're lost. Where are you heading? One of them recognised me. Shit! God damn it! I'm done for! You have to go back and tell them I did you no harm, okay? You have to go back! But then they'll take me home. We won't make it together! Then you have to do it now. They think I've kidnapped you. If they find you... Do you know what they do to child-murderers in prison? I'll tell the police you're going to France. If you go I'll tell them! You can't do this, Timo. You can't. Then you'll have to come with me to Marseille... Once I'm there... I'll take a boat forAfrica. You have to come with me. And if we get there... I'll do it in Marseille. I can't go back. Not so fast, I can't see anything. We've got to move. Timo, they're catching up. Mr Schnherr, let the girl go. We are armed, you don't stand a chance. If anyone makes a move, I'll kill her. Put down your weapons! - Let her go. - Shut up! Put down your weapons! Put them down! On the ground. If I see any of you in the rear-view, I'll kill her! Shut the door! The French border has to be here. I don't know where we are. Timo? How are you going to get on the boat? You have to bribe a harbour worker with 3000 euros. And how will you get the money? I know a guy in Marseille. Is he a friend of yours? He's my brother. I thought you didn't have any family. He's not real family. Does he know you're coming? He'll know soon enough. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Want a drink? What's wrong? Nothing. There was a photo of us in the paper. I think they know we're in France. Here. It's gone bad. This is not normal. That things are so calm. Stay at my side. Otherwise they'll shoot me down. Adele! Adele! Wake up. Adele, wake up. Go on. Stand up. Jesus! What's happened? What's happened to her? Put her in the car. Water. Timo? Go back to bed. Get a look at you! Timo? It's all right. I don't understand you. What? Sorry. Is that Marseille? Yes. What's wrong? Do you want something to drink? Timo? Drink. You have to drink more. Timo? I want to come with you on your boat. I want to come with you. - Timo... - Leave me alone! It's impossible. Get it? It's impossible... And why not? I won't do it. I'm not out of my mind! How's it going to work out... on the boat? I'll probably never get away, anyway. Forget it! And I can't push you over a cliff, either. I can't do it. What are you doing? I'm just looking. What will you do? I don't know yet. When I've got the money, I'll give some of it to you. Enough for a while. All right? Okay. I am sure that the cops are watching his place. Why? They're watching everyone who knows me. Or otherwise, he'll have called them himself. Why? He's your brother. He's not my real brother. - How is he not your real brother? - Adele! I don't understand. I was two years old when I first lived with them. They found me in an orphanage. Do you want me to go look? It's too dangerous. But the police don't know I'm free. And my hair makes me different to the photo in the papers. I could go and see if the police are there and come back. I'll give you the address. Use this money for a taxi, or you won't find it. If there are police there, you drive past and come back, okay? Look at everything closely. Maybe there's access via the roof. Give me your watch. It's nine o'clock. If you're not back by 1 p. m. Something's happened to you. And I'm splitting here. You all right, boy? What are you up to there? I'll call you back. Want to play? We're missing a player. Come on, come! Want some? - Oh, God! - What's wrong? Timo? Excuse me... are you hungry? Would you like to eat with me? Thanks, I've eaten. How about a glass of wine? Sorry, now while on duty. Thanks, anyway. It's kind of you. I need money. How much? How much? I don't have that much here. How much do you have? Today I... withdrew 500 euros. It's not enough. Maybe Nathalie has some in herthings. Turn it off! Here... there's another 300. I have to open the door. Otherwise he'll think something is up. Has something happened? Everything is fine. I... I've broken my wife's favourite vase. There'll be hell to pay! What did you tell him? I told him nothing. Here. Here's the money. It's not enough. Wait. I recognise this... Mother gave it to Nathalie for our wedding. It's worth more than 3000 euros. You'll be able to exchange it somewhere. Timo? I'm sorry I lied in front of the court. I know how you suffered at our home. Shut your mouth. I heard how he hit you. How he hurt you. The sound of it still haunts me at night. I have to tell you this. - But I was too cowardly in court... - Shut your damn mouth! Timo? Are you coming? Are you coming?
