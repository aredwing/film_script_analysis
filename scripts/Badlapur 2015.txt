Thank you. Shobha. I run a NGO. Prayaas. We work towards rehabilitating jail inmates. Actually... I am here because of Liak. Liak Tungekar. He's got stomach cancer. He's got only a year. What do you want? He can be released on medical grounds. Seek treatment. He can live the rest of his life respectably. If...you give him a pardon letter. ls he in pain? - Excuse me? Pain? Not yet, but... he's undergoing Chemo. He should have been publicly hanged 15 years ago. But this isn't bad either. He'll die a slow death. Actually...you've come all the way here.. to give me this news, so thank you Ms...? - Shobha. Shobha. I feel like celebrating today. I might order a Chinese meal. Raghav, Liak's been in jail for 15 years. He's sick, and he's dying. And all he asks is to die outside jail. In his own home, close to his mother. Only you can fulfill his last wish. So p|ease...forgive him. Do you have kids, Ms. Shobha. I have a daughter...Nitasha. She's in the 4th grade. Imagine if someone like Liak abducts your daughter, and kills her. And you have see her dissected body.. ..in the postmortem room of some hospital. Will you forgive? Because it's been 15 years? I don't know. But I do know... ...that people can change after spending time in jail. Meet him once. See for yourself, and then decide. I've brought his reports. I just want to show you all these things. Goodnight. I've left my card. In case you change your mind. Be careful at the over-bridge. It gets foggy during the monsoons. With or without your help... Liak will find release in a year. That's the decision of God. But what about you? You don't even have a picture of your wife and child in this house. You're in a prison yourself. Mr. Raghav? Govind Mishra, remember? Three promotions, two bypass surgeries! I am retiring at the end of the month. But an open case still hurts. If Liak is released, he will surely contact his partner. And then you will catch him, right? Madam, fruits aren't allowed inside. Let him take it. Okay. - Thank you. Yadav. Thank you, sir. If you forgive me, I can get out of here. They say I've got only one year left to live. My life's.. My life's ruined. I feel terrible about what happened to your family. I've heard all this 15 years ago. Tell me something new. Shall I? I feel so terrible about your family.. The first thing I'll do after getting out is meet my partner.. ..take my share of the loot. And have a good time with Jhimli for 10 months. No, Liak. There's just one way to get out of here. Tell me the name of your partner How can I tell you what I don't know? I tried telling the police.. - You're going to die here. You have a family? A Daughter. Don't you find this job tough? - Yes. Raghu? Excuse me. "As you set foot on the threshold of my heart." "I dedicated my life to you forever, beloved." "I learned to live...live.." "I learned how to live, sweetheart." "I don't know how to liven" "I don't know how to live without you, sweetheart." "Every word I said about you...is true." "Straight from my heart." "Since we met..." "..my world feels beautiful, my love." "I've finally found my sky." "We complete each other." "I dedicated my life to you forever, beloved." "I learned to live...live.." "I learned how to liven" Sir, I am Liak's mother. Forgive me, but I am not signing any letter. Sir.. - Sorry. Sir, I know who was Liak's partner in crime. Sir. I know...his partner's name.

Did you come here? I went to get some weed. I am ill. Your people follow me around, no one sells me the stuff. What happened here? What do you think? I feel". Hold on. Stop. What's he doing here? I gave Mrs Harman a lift once. And she invited me to the restaurant. Good homely food. Liak was praising the food as well. What do you want to say? 15 years ago, Harman worked in a small garage. Salary, only 2000. But suddenly he hit some jackpot.. ..and now owns a posh restaurant. So you mean... Harman is Liak's partner. Congratulations, sir. Finally you found him. Found him?

I told Raghav. And that's the reason you're out here. You didn't do a thing for last 14 years. And now you're threatening your mother. What did you tell the inspector? We had sex? All I said that when I left you were asleep. What for? You know he asked me such absurd questions. No one ever dared to speak to me like that.. - This is a police investigation. I will have to answer all their questions. I don't believe this. I thought there was something between us. I really liked you. - Maybe I didn't like you. You sympathize with the criminals in jail, don't you? But what about the people whose lives they ruined? You used me, right? Maybe the inspector's right. You are involved in some murder. He might arrest me. Put me in jail. Then you'll come visit me. Hold my hands. Relieve my pain. Sympathize with me. And we can even have sex in the doctor's cabin. How dare.. Where's the money? Where's the money? Where's my money? Where's my money? My friend? I killed Harman and his wife. You killed? How did you kill them? With a hammer. In their own bedroom. Do you want to know how? How I did it? Do you want to hear? First I covered the room with plastic. When his wife stepped out after a shower.. ...I severed a blow to her head. She fell unconscious. Next, when Harman returned with the money, I killed him too. You really killed them? Your friend, whose name you didn't utter for 15 years.. ..was ready to give me your share of the money. And his wife was ready to sleep with me...to save him. Are you telling the truth? I buried them in Khadakvasla sector 3. And you will never find that money. And now you're going to kill me too. - You're already dead. You're just going to rot for few more months. Harman didn't kill your wife, I did. I was confused. I went crazy for a moment. Your kid fell out and your wife was screaming. Suddenly I pulled out the gun and shot her. I had blown a fuse. But you had a cool mind. You murdered two people... with a hammer. Innocent people. What is the difference.. between you and me You've gone crazy. Get yourself treated. What happened to you? What happened? Show me. Your face is completely swollen. You're back to your old ways, right? What are you looking at? Jhimli. lam going to die. Huh? That's why I was released from jail. I've got cancer. I've just one year to live. Yes. I was scared to know. When I was released, I thought I'll get my share.. ..because I didn't utter my partner's name for 15 years. And we'll travel, have fun for 1 O months with that money. Why didn't you tell me earlier? I wanted to surprise you. "Jhimli.." Okay, madam... I'll change this. Chicken noodles, right? - Hey...stop. Who are you? Sameer. From Uncle's Kitchen. Sameer.

I was supposed to get 25 million. But Raghu killed my partner and his wife. Now watch what I do to him.... Don't do anything. Wait.. I committed a murder. I am a convicted killer. If you ever hit her again, I will kill you. Goodnight. Where are you going? Cleaning my house. What brings you here? I'd like a cup of tea. You didn't tell me that you went to Harman's home too. Fingerprints. Perfect match. They invited me for lunch. You get a lot of invitations for lunch. Where's the money? - What money? Don't play that game with me. Liak's share of money. From the bank robbery You're clearly visible in the CC camera at Aundh signal. In Harman's car. You murdered Harman and his wife. What will you prove in the court?
