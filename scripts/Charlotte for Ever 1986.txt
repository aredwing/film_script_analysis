Im not your Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, sweety. Think cause you crashed your car, you can shove your shit onto me? I dont have a penny to my name, look what Im banging on. Youre banging your whiskey on the table, I see that alright. Do you suck ice cubes? - It's not about that. - It's not about that. Have you tried to check how much alcohol is in your blood? What are you talking about? Come on! Shut up and listen. You'll be stunned. Abigail has fallen into a habit of sitting down on my bed every day... eating crackers or a biscuit... at night I felt the crumbs rolling on my skin... falling out of her child's teeth, they sharpened my criminal desire... and inflamed my sleepless nights with convulsive erections. I showed her how I could draw sewing needles with just one line... and the smaller the eye was... the harder she laughed with her silent and nervous laughter... and clapped her hands leaning back on my bed. Not bad. - This is great, isn't it? - What? This is great! An arthouse film. Of course. One night she cuddled up to me with her body full of goose bumps... like a chicken in the polar cold of the large living room on the folding bed in the empty pool where battered stars were falling down, the only loving words that I've said in my life. whispered in the ear of this mute deaf girl. - In the ear of this mute deaf girl. - Not bad. - I'll continue. - What? - I'll continue reading. - What? I'll go on. Unconsciously, I uttered unbelievable scabrous words... that came out like ventriloquisms from my clenched teeth... when under me, writhing in euphoria... and instinctive orgasmic attempts, little Abigail screamed in silence! I couldn't come. Afraid of the explosion that seemed inevitable... that was tormenting my insides, at the exact moment... when I was ready to give up my soul, crying, I suppressed the orgasm... and tore myself away from my prey. And these few grams and milliliters of semen... hit into my brain and caused an inflammation... the consequence was like a dazzling flashback. With many idle attempts, I tried furiously masturbating to lance this abscess... burning my skull, but never that warm serum... that came to light was the same that came out that memorable night. On the next day Abigail was sent to the boarding school. What am I supposed to do with it? Honestly. If you think I'll give you another ten grand... for what you just read, you are sadly mistaken. Oh, you're here. Charlotte, give Uncle Herman a kiss. Fuck you, "uncle"! There was a time when you were jumping on my knees... ...you even wet my pants once. What shoots at the heel but gets in your nose. Remember? Yes, yes, shut up. Charlotte. See, Herman? Charlotte, my dear Charlotte, I feel so sorry for your mom. You know, I loved her a lot. I'll never forget her bright eyes... her beautiful hands. Stan, think about your daughter. She's a miracle. You're killing yourself - you drink, you smoke, you fuck around. While this girl lives for your sake. First, her mother died, and if it's going to be like this, you won't last six months either. I'm not dead yet, you old fool. I forbid you to nag at Charlotte. Understood? Forget it. You're afraid to object aren't you. The past has only taught me one thing: the only way to stay alive is to go with the flow... and see what happens. Relationships between people should change from time to time... just like shedding skin... because something else, something bigger, is showing through it. Maybe, to save the relationship you need to set them aside sometimes and see if they take another form... and if they don't it means they shouldn't exist anyway. Cool isn't it? It's Elia Kazan - that nutcase... who ratted on all his friends under McCarthy. Here, honey, give it to daddy. This is the last time I'm lending to you. If I don't have this lousy script in a week... .. it's over. And your "intellectual" quotations... you can shove them right in your hole if you know what I mean. Herman, please, she's only fifteen. Dad, I'm in ninth grade, I know what a hole is. Really?.. What is it then? Answer me! What is a hole? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know... It's an exhaust pipe just like on "Yamaha". Philosophy is nonsense! I'm sick of it! Spinoza! Schopenhauer! Bergson! Sartre! I see you're not good with math. Our teacher is crazy, she sticks her finger in her nose up to her elbows... and then rolls her boogers on the table. She's like this all the time. Smokes cigarettes too. She smells terrible. She can't stand me at all; I don't know what I did to her... Maybe she doesn't like your cute little face? Dad, where is mom's picture? It was too striking. And a reproach in the eyes.  You killed her. Little girl, you can't say that. You don't know anything about it. You don't know anything about this story. You don't know anything about it. Don't touch her, you fat pig. It's between me and her. I want my mom. I want to see my mom! Why did she die? Damn it, I want my mom. Honey, go grab some ice. - You're going to get wasted again. - This is a good time. Dolores Haze is wanted. Distinctive marks: red lips, brown hair. will be fifteen soon. Occupation - A starlet. Where are you, Dolores, what magic carpet is flying you away. Which star are you? What carriage - moped, motorcycle - is waiting at your door? Who are you dancing with, my darling, in your blue jeans and old shirt,.. I'm watching you out of the corner of my eye. Lolita... She didn't close her grey eyes when I was kissing her closed lips. Do you know the "Green sun" perfume? You're French, I suppose? It's over Lo, I'm dying from remorse and hate. But I'm raising my hairy fist again and I'm crawling at your feet. Hey, sergeant! There she is. Cuts the shine of shop windows sweeping away by the storm. It's her... Sergeant, give me my Lolita back. With her fierce look and softlips. She weights no more than 90 pounds. My car broke down. The last step is the hardest one. I will die on the side of the road, Lolita. The rest is literature. Nabokov. That's right. Have you read it? Stole it from the library. I've read Miller too. Tropics. Listen, baby, it's too early for you. It's plain porn. It's never too early to not be an idiot. I also got through Apollinaire's "11 Thousand Virgins". Prince Vibescu. Countess. Isn't that cute of you! Adelaide told me. She is very interested in sex. I thought you didn't see each other anymore. I see her when she comes out of here. Isn't she pretty? Such tits at her age they'll be hanging down soon. I give her two years tops. Did you feel her up or something? She has no talent for Latin or Greek. But it's money for us. But there should be money left from mom. Yes. Cash. Dad, you're just an alcoholic, and I'm not in a rush to become an orphan. You think I'm a pyromaniac and a murderer. What can I say? You were driving the Porsche. That's it, I'm fucking done! Maybe I was driving but I was sober that day. That's what you're saying. I haven't showed you police records just because it's hyperrealism... you can't stand it. Take that! Mom. Mom. You crashed into a tank truck! It exploded because of you! Admit it if you're not a complete asshole! Say it one more time and I'll send you to boarding school. Good and I won't see your ugly face anymore. Shut up! Your hand. I'm sorry. Yes, it's burned. You understand now? Do you? I tried to drag mom out of pile of metal and burned my hand. You understand? You don't understand anything, stupid. Don't call me stupid, damn it. Give me a kiss. No, you're not stupid. You understand now, I don't know. Well, children, I got to go. Charlotte, remember, time heals and washes away your grief. Stan, you're the man as far as I know. You've got balls. Write the script. Charlotte, I added ten bucks for your candy. Does your hand still hurt? It's fine. Forget it! It could be worse. I have to get up early tomorrow. Have to write an essay. What's the subject? Edgar Allan Poe "The Murders in the Rue Morgue". Well written. The one with the orangutan. That's why I need to analyze stylistics... and the detective plot. Not bad! Why do they teach children such horrific things? All right, come here. Dad, he's not home. I know. Let's play. Hey! Becassine, would you help? I don't get what you are doing here. Where the hell are you? Come here. Watch it! Take the helmet. Whoever knocks down the most - wins. Come on. Shut up. It's moto-bowling! Your turn. Get to it. A game for fools. I wonder who came up with it. You lost - now you have to moon. This is driving me crazy. How long are you going to bug me like this? Who did this? It's Therese. A friend of Becassine. Oh, Becassine... Charlotte came up with it. Interesting. She was sitting by the radiator she's a repeat student. So what? Stop it. All right. Go to the store, otherwise they'll be closed. Come on, Therese. No... My leg hurts. All right, it's ok. Dad, keep an eye on her. Broom is in the kitchen. So is the dustpan. What? What? What? To the left! Move! Go! All right! Get up! What did she say to you about her mom? Yeah, I see. You like wagging your behind. Yes I do. Ah, you're trying to get me exited. You may not be the brightest. But there's something about you. Are you scared? Why? It could be worse. Look at me. What's wrong? Ashamed? Dad. What? I was given a task at school to answer the Proust Questionnaire. Proust Questionnaire? I thought it's studied later. You're in middle school, aren't you? Do you want me to help you? All right, first question. What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery? Lack of toilet paper. What is your idea of earthly happiness? Ladies restroom in the Maxim restaurant. I can't say that. Go on. For what failiure do you have the most toleration? When I fail to hit somebody in the face! Your favorite character in history? Mickey Maos, but not Mouse. Maos. Just like that? Exactly. The quality you most admire in a man? The ability to fuck. I can't put that down. Fine, next one. Answer some questions yourself. Not all for me. Next one. What quality you most admire in a woman? Her wetness. It's not going to work for me. I'll think of something. I bet you will. - Next. - Your favorite occupation? Hand job. This won't do for you. No, you can't write that. Who would you like to be? That's easy , Caligula's horse. Caligula was crazy. So was his horse, probably. What is your most marked characteristic? Most marked characteristic? Lack of character. What do you most value in your friends? What do you most value...? Put "how fast they leave my house". This will do for you, not for me. I can't write that about myself. Then think of something. Your biggest fault? Being soft when I need to be hard. - All right. - Your dreams of happiness? - That it won't go down. - That won't do. You're not really helping. But, honey, I can't do everything. I'm helping a little. Some answers are cool. - Next. - Your favorite color? Goose shit. Why? 'Cause it sounds good. Great! Next. Your favorite bird? Favorite bird? Paradise bird. The Lady bird. Your favorite poet? Well... Picabia. I showed you Picabia's poetry. Write: comma. Picabia and me. - Not me, you! - No, not me. I forgot it's your homework. Picabia... and papa. Just like Pi-ca-bi-a-pa-pa. Not bad. Your favorite heroines in history? Heroines? The ones on heroin. No, don't write that down, it'll cost you. What's next? Historical character that you despise the most? If I was answering, I'd say "me". But I don't want to write "me". Then write "dad". No, don't want to write "dad". I'll need to fill that out. What military event do you admire most? Repeat the question. What military event do you admire most? Military event... I know: heavy artillery's volley. What natural gift would you most like to possess? What natural gift would you most like to possess? To know how to shit without a smell. That's it. He left you. What can I say, you poor thing? Why are you falling in love with the young? That's just the way it is. Love blossomed in my heart like a pink bud in the garden. But he was smelling them all the time. Are you a doctor? Have you seen his pupils? It's as obvious as footprints in the snow. He was doping like crazy. You can cry now. Cry. Cry. Your Stephen is an asshole. And he doesn't like guys, it's obvious. He humiliated you. He used his ass to pay the dealer. Have you seen yourself in the mirror? You're just a mess. Old fag. Stop it! If you have a little bit of humanity left. Humanity? My dad, mom, wife and dog died. And any day now Charlotte will have a kid or bring a guy home... some worker, black or Asian, it'll be just great... so... Stephen... - Stephen... - You don't understand, this is the end! Be a man, God damn it. Oh! I'm sorry; I didn't mean to hurt you. If you want to know,.. it's better if I tell you. Your boyfriend lives with a prostitute now who gives him dope. Lucky bastard. And you're here with your hand. Scarlatti, Gershwin, Cole Porter - everything in the past. I see you know how to hit a raw nerve. Son of a bitch, I had enough already! You can now play one part for the left hand. I know, Ravel. I suggest something else. "Jesus, may your joy remain". This one? This is for the left hand as well. You can't do anything with just one left hand. I can't even jerk off with one hand. Enough. Stop talking! What? Enough already! Damn it! Look at yourself. Charlotte! Are you having fun here? Hey, Leon the Fatty, is that a new perfume? Well, it's Guerlain's Jicky I thought it's for women. Charlotte... - What are you wearing? - have some tact... My natural fragrance. It's better to wash yourself sometimes, sweety. Only dirty ones wash themselves. Where is Stephen? He's gone. For work? For pleasure. For pleasure. Dad, I'm going to a party tonight. Ok. Just don't take the moped. I'll call a cab for you. Be home by midnight. Twelve o'clock, no excuses. Don't forget about Cinderella. Yeah, or your pumpkin cracks. I'm so sick of you two! Shepherding me all the time! You can only shepherd a cow. So what are we going to do? I've grown boobs. I touched them one night. Drunk as hell. With my hand, they were light... like two lacy handkerchiefs with the needle still in them. Is that how you burned your hand? What did you say, asshole? I know you don't like guys. But you killed your wife. Great! You too! Just like Charlotte. Soon I'll believe it myself. You still believe in God. I'll tell you, sweety. I saw how angels died - beautiful like Praxiteles' statues. Or Michelangelo's. Young gods were writhing in agony. Cancer - and I couldn't do anything... to ease their agonizing deaths. but to give them this fucking morphine. And your wife here. What about my wife? You want me to believe in this God after that? What do you think about it? Listen, Stanly. I'm listening, Oliver. As far as I know, you didn't fuck me. I don't remember that. So I can tell you the truth. You are depriving your daughter. This baby... is a real treasure. A gift from God. What she has in her head is in your ass. She thinks you're a murderer. That's where your problems come from. Problems my ass. Kiss my hairy asshole. Translation? Translation. - Kiss my hairy ass. But, seriously. Admit it. You were driving. And you want me to believe that the tank truck caused the accident? Tell it to someone else, sweety. Do you want to see the police report? There you go, moron. Stop it. Stop it. I know. I've read the report about Stephen's accident. And then you'll receive the same one about Charlotte. Then you'll know what a real pain feels like. You better take your words back or I'll smash your face. What? Can't you take a joke? Gosh! - Was this a joke? - What should I take back? What said is said. Swallow and forget, honey? Don't honey me! Go fuck yourself. You never swallow? We're gentlemen after all. Look at you, look at me. Look at us. We're just two pieces of shit. I know me; I can look truth straight in the eyes. Truth kills, buddy. Gods are on earth. Somebody believes in heaven. But not in God! Say "gods" in plural. I have an idea, an idea my friend. Close your big mouth and fuck off. What beautiful eyes. Just like agates. So you are Charlotte. What your dad said... Hey, easy, you cow. Keep your hands off! I just wanted to say... Go away, you pig! Quiet. What about my money? - He's broke. - Ah shit. You've lost the slipper. And you - my respect. What are you doing, god damn it? I found pubic hairs in the sheets. You think I'll sleep in the same bed as your whore? I hope you get crabs. Charlotte. Charlotte for ever. Dad, dad! I'm scared. Come on, come here. Why are you doing this to me? What am I doing again? You're fucking around. I do what I want and can. And I don't have to report to anybody. And I'm not telling tales to anybody. Shit! Tales. Grimm. Andersen. Do you think I'm that stupid? No, you're like a creamy toffee, still fresh... but you're tormenting me. You're an asshole, dad. Go to hell. Mom. Where is my mom? Mom is in heaven. If you keep this up I'll join her soon. I saw a gun in your drawer. The first bullet is yours, my darling. When you shoot yourself later - don't miss. Or you'll get twenty years in jail. You'll be in the same cell as mom's murderer. Shut up! Will you shut up already? Carmen, my baby, remember! Our journeys and stations - which ones? Nights and bars - so what? Oh, Carmen, our terrible fights. And mountains, and the dwarf oak. And our last fight. And a gun in my hand. And a hole in your head, Carmen. It smells disgusting. Smells like shit. Red stinks, that's right. Get out of here! I'm here! What do you want? You. He gave you the key? Stan is teaching me Greek! Don't you get it? Don't be afraid, I won't eat you. Everybody's saying that. What if they come back? Don't worry, they're at the cemetery. They died? No, you idiot! They are visiting the mom's grave. And I'm here visiting you! I'll steal something from classics like Benjamin Constant. Herman won't notice. Poor idiot! He's an ignoramus. As far as I remember... Aha! Here! She just died. Her heart is broken. And she is leaving a note for him. Right here. Just say a word - she wrote. Is there a country where I will not follow you to? Is there an abode where I would not stay to live next to you... without burdening your life? But no, you don't want to. All the plans I offer with shyness and trembling... as the fear freezes my heart - all of them are impatiently denied by you. The best I've reached - is your silence. Such cruelty doesn't fit your nature. You are kind, your actions are noble and filled with devotion... But what actions will erase your words? These merciless words are heard everywhere. I hear them at night. They haunt and devour me, they pervert everything you do. Do I really have to die? Then you'll be happy. A poor creature will die that you protected - Poor Eleanor will die, who you can't stand by yourself anymore... Who you can't find a place on earth for without feeling annoyed. She'll die. She'll die. You'll be walking alone in the crowd... You'll meet people that today you're grateful to for their indifference. And maybe one day, hurt by these callous hearts... you'll regret that the one heart that belonged to you... lived for your favor and would stand up despite thousands of dangers... to protect you - and that you will not honor...with just one look. Beautiful, isn't it? That is wild, terrific and crazy. There is just one problem - it's not his. What do you mean, not his? It's Benjamin Constant's. Who the hell is he? Are the rights of authorship available? He kicked off in 1830. That piece of shit! Who - Constant? His constant is the inconstancy. What do you want, my dear? He's killing himself for this broad. And in between drinking, he's stealing wherever he can. Intellectually, of course. Tell me, doctor! Are you a pedagogue, by chance? Though I don't have anything against queers... I'm asking you, did your grandma like to ride bicycles? Pardon me, I not understand. It's simple. Bicycle - pedal - pederast! Now, whose shit is this? Benjamin Constant's! It's not funny. Well, what do you think? You're a cheater. Be careful, darling. Give me some money. What? Money? Where should I look for money? For Charlotte. She is not my daughter. Ask her mother. Are you in trouble? You will be now. Asshole! Move it! I will! Now, I have something to tell you. Hurry, I don't have much time. Why are you acting so nervous? A red day? What is a red day? Period. What the hell else would it be. A holiday? I'm fed up with you! Listen carefully, stop telling him about the accident. You'll kill him. Who? Me? Dad? That's exactly what I said. And don't play fool, you understood me clearly. Ok, Aunt Leona. So I won't see Stephen anymore. I know you had an eye on him. He was hansome; he was tall and smelled like scorching sand. I take the truck, you take the Porsche. Why not... I don't care. Watch out, I'm starting up. You're doing it on purpose. What's the matter? Did I scare you? What happened? Goodnite baby. This is just a nightmare. Think about mom. Forget about me. Dad, I got "F" in math. What are you doing here? - I just. - What you just? - Well, I'll explain. - Go on, I'm listening. Maybe, you won't believe but... I only believe my own eyes. I got hot. Of course, you got hot! So this is what you're learning from him! And you're not in love with Stan? Of course, I am! You have no right to fall in love with him! He's mine! He's not yours, he's mine! I hate you! He's mine, hands off! I hate you! You bitch! You'll hear from me. And you get out! Out! Get lost, I said. You're all crazy here, I'll tell dad, you'll see. You're a murderer and a monster. Murderer because you fucked Adelaide. - And a monster because... - Because? because you fucked Adelaide. You want to say I'm the murderer because I killed mom, right? Is that what you wanted to say? Yes. How can you throw something like that at me? That's what I think. Leave me alone! Go ahead, what are you waiting for? I don't have anything else but you. If I lose you - I lose everything. You need to remove the safety first. It's really simple. Elementary, my dear Watson. You should learn; I've already learnt my lessons. You're right, my angel. I'm the monster and the murderer. Murderer without an alibi. A loser! A cheater! Worthless piece of shit! An alcoholic! A smoker! A dog! No, not a dog! I'm sorry; this is not what I wanted to say. My poor doggie. You were my only comfort. Now you don't need your bones anymore. Remember, we were playing poker together? You would always lose. Even holding all the aces. You're in dog heaven now. And I'll be burning in hell. Burning till I die! Damn it, I don't feel well. My heart. This pump. Damn pump! I think that's what it is. Who is dying, me or you! Ah, damn it, you take care of it yourselves now! I'm sick of dealing with your crap! Where is my baby? Damn it, where is Charlotte? God, it hurts! Mom! I'm sorry! Now you're calling me mom? I'm sorry! I did it on purpose. I knew it wasn't you. What are you talking about? I knew it wasn't your fault. I just wanted to make you mad. What a little shit you are.
