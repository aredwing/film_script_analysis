You were scared. lt's close to midnight And something evil's a-lurkin' in the dark Under the moonlight You see a sight that almost stops your heart You try to scream But terror takes the sound before you make it And you start to freeze As horror looks you right between the eyes You're paralyzed You hear the door slam And realize there's nowhere left to run You feel the cold hand And wonder if you'll ever see the sun And you close your eyes And hope that this is just imagination Girl But all the while You hear a creature creepin' up behind You're out of time They're out to get you There's demons closin' in on every side They will possess you Unless you change that number on your dial Now is the time For you and l to cuddle close together Yeah All through the night l'll save you from the terror on the screen l'll make you see
