[CHILD SCREAMS] THE STOCKINGS WERE HUNG BY THE CHIMNEY WITH CARE... IN HOPES THAT SAINT NICHOLAS SOON WOULD BE THERE. AND HE WAS. RIGHT THERE. IN MY HOUSE. THE REAL SANTA. ALIVE. THAT'S RIGHT, THE BEARDED ONE REALLY EXISTS. BUT I'M GETTING A LITTLE AHEAD OF MY STORY HERE. LET'S GO BACK A LITTLE EARLIER. 'TWAS THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS, AND ALL THROUGH THE PAD, EVERYONE WAS AT HOME, EVEN WORKAHOLIC OL' DAD. AND MOM IN THE KITCHEN COOKING STILL LIKE A ROOKIE, SCORCHING THE BACKS OF THE GINGERBREAD COOKIES. AND THEN, THERE'S MY SISTER, A PARENTS' DELIGHT. ANNOYING, BAD-TEMPERED, AND OBNOXIOUSLY BRIGHT. AND PRECIOUS LITTLE PETER, THE FAMILY LOVES HIM THE MOST. IF HE COMES INTO MY ROOM ONE MORE TIME, HE'LL BE TOAST. THEN THERE IS ME, HANDSOME AND TRUE. THE BEST AT EVERYTHING THAT ANYONE CAN DO. INTELLIGENT, WITTY, THERE IS NO DOUBT. KIND, COMPASSIONATE. PETER, GET OUT. BUT, DANNY-- WHAT'S THE RULE ABOUT COMING IN MY ROOM? NEVER COME IN YOUR ROOM. BUT DAD WANTS TO KNOW WHEN YOU WAN TO DECORATE THE TREE. I WANT TO DECORATE THE TREE ON CHRISTMAS EVE, LIKE EVERY OTHER YEAR WE'VE EVER DECORATED CHRISTMAS TREES IN THIS FAMILY. BUT IT IS CHRISTMAS EVE. IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS EVE, DOOFUS. THAT'S TOMORROW. NOW CLOSE THE DOOR. OK, WHATEVER YOU SAY. CHRISTMAS EVE. [EXPLOSION] CHRISTMAS EVE? OOPS. Danny: THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH CHRISTMAS, WHEN YOUR WALLET IS LIGHT. YOU CAN'T STAND YOUR FATHER, AND YOUR SISTER IS JUST... A LITTLE TOO BRIGHT. YOU MUST TURN TO THE ONE WHO GETS YOU OUT OF YOUR FUNK, JUST SELL YOUR LITTLE BROTHER A WHOLE BUNCH OF...JUNK. HEY, SWEETIE. WHAT'S ALL THAT STUFF? I'VE BEEN CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. SHOPPING? WHERE? DANNY'S ROOM. DANIEL FRANCIS WRIGLEY, GET OUT HERE NOW! UH-OH. [TICKING] WHAT ABOUT MY NO-RETURNS POLICY? DANNY, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHAKE DOWN YOUR LITTLE BROTHER. HE WASN'T SHAKING ME. HE WAS BEING NICE. PETE, HE WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU, AND HE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. STICK A SOCK IN IT, KATY. DANNY. WHAT? OK. PLEASE STICK A SOCK IN IT. BUT, MOM, I WAN ALL THAT STUFF. SEE? WHO'S THE VICTIM HERE? HE'S NO COMPLAINING. COME ON. IT'S JUST LIKE UNCLE NICK SAYS. I'M JUST HELPING HIM SHARE THE WEALTH. UNCLE NICK, HUH? IT'S TOO BAD IT'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE'S WEALTH THAT UNCLE NICK IS SO EAGER TO SHARE. NO. UNCLE NICK IS THE BOMB. HE IS, OK? YOU JUST DON' UNDERSTAND HIM. Mom: DANNY, NICK'S GO A LOT OF GOOD QUALITIES, YES, BUT HE'S NOT EXACTLY A GOOD ROLE MODEL FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT? Dad: HE'S A CON ARTIST. Danny: HE'S AN ENTREPRENEUR. RIGHT. OK. HE'S A CON ARTIS WITH A LAPTOP. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF THE PRESENTS. IT'S A MATTER OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOUR LITTLE BROTHER. HE LOOKS UP TO YOU THE SAME WAY YOU LOOK UP TO NICK. Peter: AAH! [CRASH] OH, PETER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU SAID IT WAS FAMILY MONEY. HO HO, OH, BUDDY. DANNY'S OUR FAMILY, AND HE NEEDS IT. I WAS JUS SHARING THE WEALTH. OK, THAT'S WEIRD. I CAN SEE HIS LIPS MOVING, BUT I CAN HEAR DANNY TALKING. IT'S OK, DANNY. YOU CAN SHAKE ME DOWN IF YOU WANT TO. I LIKE IT. DO ME A FAVOR, PETE. JUST DON'T, LIKE, UH, SAY THAT IN FRONT OF ANYONE... EVER AGAIN. OK? UNCLE NICK IS BY FAR THE COOLEST PERSON IN THIS FAMILY. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW HE AND DAD COULD BE FROM THE SAME PARENTS. YOU'RE THE COOLEST, DANNY. I APPRECIATE THAT, LITTLE DUDE, BUT, UM... I GOT A LONG WAY TO GO TO MEASURE UP TO UNCLE NICK. I BET HE'S SOMEPLACE RIGHT THIS MINUTE MAKING A MAJOR BIG-BUCKS BUSINESS DEAL.
