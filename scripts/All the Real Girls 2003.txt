The places where I go are not so smart. They are ongoing and sing songs. You go out together? We spend a lot of time together. We need to blunder when you go out with the guys here... It's just that... finally... This is different when your family. I knew not. What he sees in you, this is what he hates his home. You think he will forgive you and drop? He will mature, tell you okay? ''I saw what you have done to other girls. You can leave with my sister.'' - You want what, that I stop everything? - And him? I want him to calm down. Y no chance. Maybe if you did not image Salop's ex-boyfriend... But this is the case. I dreamed that... you did grow a garden on a trampoline... and I was delighted to have invented Peanut butter. I saw them all today. What are you doing with it? What are you doing with it? - You say what? - I say what? He'll kiss as he screwed me... and as he kissed all the others. - You fucking my sister? - Are you who you? Who do you think? It has not hampered. I was just another. I continued to see him. I thought I loved her and he loved me. I thought that one day he eventually love me. I do not know to whom you spoke. You're a goddamn liar! That is the truth. Let him answer. I do not know what you speak! What you have, against me? Who you talked? Got what, against me? Many, I have a lot. He is jealous. He wants to enter his own sister. What? Come here. Come on. Get up. It's your fault, son of a bitch! Tip. It's finished, we are no longer friends! You're even in my top 10! Later Tip. It was that the girl to the river? Tammy CLINARD. It is one of those girls... You're out with her? You have slept with her? Is a brothel on your bed! That date of a moment ago. I was drunk. Wait. I can tell you something? I'm sorry. Are you okay? - Be not sorry. - What have I done? I just wanted to tell you... this is the first time I make love. But I trust you. Do you trust me? You make me feel really trust? I made a lot of mistakes not very pretty. With girls? Really not pretty. And all... Anything that could make things easier for you... I would tell you... because I want to you. A lot. And when... when we fall about people that I have known... I want you to know... what they hate me. I think that... for me... if what you did before... did you what you are now, so... whatever... disgusting stuff that you did... I'll have to do with because... for the moment... you and me. You're the boy that I must keep and I know that... I am the girl that you need. So... if you choose not to tell me I don 't ask no questions. My first time I 13 years... it was in a basement with a girl older than I did not know. And when we finished... I was nervous... I was trying to be cool. I took out a joke that was no... and it never did again. I want to be sure in a million years... I can always look at you in the face and tell you a lot of stuff. I will go. How can I believe this girl that you need? When you see the, you know. And if you were not good enough for her? ldiot. You're not attentive... neither cultivated nor honest or strong. And you do not believe in anything. You're like all men of my life. I am strong, me. Yes. And you're funny. But you know, my baby... I have suffered, and I do not want to it happens to others. I was in his place. I've seen this kind of scrutiny. I am happy, that's all. Look at me when you say that. I'm happy. I do not believe you. Are you in love right now? You mean what? When you're more in love, you should come home. I have a water mattress. - It means what it? - Nothing. You show me your friends? I have the muscle. Look. Mate me that. Noel, wait. Who is your number 2? Who is your replacement? - What? - Who would be your second choice? Your first choice is not available. Who's number 2? I would not choose to number 2. You do not have to do it for real but if you had to choose, it would be who? This person would be. If you were forced? - Why would I? - All the others have disappeared. And if I wanted to be alone? Any''only''it not. Who would be the number 2? This is ridiculous, as a question. You would rather sleep with me or a priest? Everyone that pass through your life... only pass. And then they all disappear, and... And there is nobody to replace the girl... She speaks with you, you need it... she laughs when you say things Laughing, she understands you... Then she whispers in your ear... You know, when she died... I do not even shaking... because I saw myself in his eyes before they close. I was naked, I watched... and I was ready. But feelings you felt for Elise... It worth it? I think that... and that I felt If something happens to you... or your mother... or Feng Shui or... Love another woman? I do not want to ever I feel as close. Never. - You're always with Eric? - Yes. You always him die buttons in the back? I prefer listening to and I bore him his buttons... Stopping to talk about that? It is really disgusting. He happens to be jealous? That it happens. When you talk to another? But, I mean... He understands. Often, it stays there and it monitors. But it's not me he is wary... - Is the other guy. - Agreed. They are unpredictable. We can not trust them. That's true. I learned it at my expense. You can not trust them. You have already been taken slat? I was at a boarding school for girls from the age of 12 years, so... I have not much experience. Got something in the hair. I like me when you mouse. If we spent the night together? An evening pajamas? I came home to sleep? It can be a tent and hide under the cushions. I think it's a good idea. That sent the Mexican food here. Two pieces. Great. What do you want? Ie? I know. You wanted us to drunk? Not really. You want to get drunk? No. Not really, no. You wanted to take a helping cushion? That's good, because... - Go! - No. I always have my pillow. I am aware. I want to show you something. What? I would often fish... with my father. One summer, I had 12 years... and we went to Lake Sturtsum both. I am doing well and I knew back fish. My father cut, it was cooked... and then we ate. But one day... I was driving... I was driving the boat. I was not supposed to, because I was too young. But my father left me keep the wheel because he had drunk too much. And there were children in the water... swimming. Tip does not even know it. I had to let the boat drift... I went back into a boy. It was thought that he was killed, because... it does not back and... everybody was screaming. My father... I was pushed to the rear of the boat and told me not to watch. I took a hook at the rear, and I started to scratch me... the side. When I returned at home... any slashed... I told my mom and that Tip it was an accident. It was not true. You're the first person to whom I want to talk about it. The one who I wanted to speak more than 5 minutes... of my life. It makes me happy you do me confidence. It always makes you ill? It hurts because... I know what I thought when I've done... It was like a relief. I was happy to feel pain. You're so nice. Sometimes I am afraid of myself. But I fear not with you. You're there. Get undressed, just in the water. Everything okay? I thought I put a boxer. But it will. A second. It is cold! You're a baby. What? You see this? It's hard skin that. I do not know if you know Celtic traditions... but it is the symbol of boxing. Are you okay? I demolished the balls. T'arrtes bombs, baby. Only dishes... and over ''I-you-drop-your-pants''. Only what? Only dishes. It hurts. I have no evil. Kiss me in the neck. You want me t'embrasse in the neck? - LCI. - Agreed. Here? Wait a minute... You are safe here? Where it already? Right here. I do not like love. Est-ce que je te happy? You're the most beautiful. You want to stay here with me? Sometimes I do not know... I wish I could read in your mind. I want it or not as it was with other girls. Tell me... You are the typed? So? It is top secret? I'm not supposed to know? You keep it for dessert? If it was so long I went out with her... I at least hit its nenes. ll need that I have to tell you. It has a beautiful pair. It happen to think that... your friends are not good enough for you? Or that you're not good enough for your friends? I spoke to Beth last night. The girls believe that I avoided. This is the case? I think it has lost sight of. So we decided to go to the hut by Vicki this weekend. Just you and girls? You want to come? There, there are tree trunks... needles, pine cones and sand. The nature get out through the eyes. I like the lake in winter. I like the sound of water. It makes me want to pee. I think that... I will go... I know I miss you... and do the same here. I want to dance.

I surely wanted to become someone good. You know what? My problem is not what you did. It's between me and... me. When I did what I did... I felt... so... evil. This is where I am realized that I loved you. You can not understand, but It is at this moment that I understood. It is a matter of emotions. We are not prepared for that. That's true. I miss your face. You know what? You have no right to hate me. Because I stop you from doing so. Nobody said we should be perfect. I do not suffer thinking of you. My heart is yours. Close your eyes. Do as if you saw the ocean. Do as if you were facing the ocean. You're a millionaire. Do you like running under the ocean. You jump over the mountains. You jump over the mountains. Everybody loves you. Cool. I was the richest man the world. Now I'm here watching the field... happier than ever... with almost nothing. I think I will let me grow a beard. Mom? You know, when you hit me... it hurts me. I'm always wrong. But it made me well. You have already taken a baby in your arms? There will always be as old? I want to do this alone. I mean... I brought thee so far. I did not need swimming lessons, me. And the very fact that you do not, I'm desperate. Are you afraid of? ll no sharks here. lmagine a dog seas arrives and you track. You'll be ashamed, dog land. Frankly, if you take no your chance now... thou shalt not ever. Come on, is that of water. It is water. Listen, buddy. This river goes in both directions. Hence... and there. You know what I mean? This is a real puzzle, finally. You're happy now?
