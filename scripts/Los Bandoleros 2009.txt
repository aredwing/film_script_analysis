Looks like you have been really moving up in the world. Who's this guy? Santo, Han. Han, Santo. - You look like shit. - That is a lot coming from you. How come we can't stay in a hotel, huh? Oh, complaining already! I like air-conditioning, you know? And room service. - So, you guys love each other. - With TV! Dig in. Welcome to our island, Han. Island in paradise. Tonight we go speak to Elvis. See if we can fix this problem. - First we pick up Leo. - Leo? So where are we actually picking up this Leo friend of yours? Prison. Yo! My God! Move! Move, man! And that's why you're always impressive man. - Hey where you going? - I'll be back, one second. Or you could drive around the corner. Park and come through the front. Hey. Wait, wait. I ain't goin' out there like this. Do you wanna wear my shirt? No man. I got it covered, man. Somebody's coming to bring my shit. Don't worry. I got it covered. Who is this guy we're meeting? Elvis. He's a politician who gives a fuck about the people. Beautiful. Hey Han. I bet this is a lot different than China. - Never been. - Or Japan, wherever you're from. Like I said I never been east of the Altlantic. - He asked you where you're from. - States. - Is that where you met Dom? - Nah, I met him in Mexico. Used to hear about him in the racing scene. But didn't start running with him until then. And? You guys are hungry? Or you want me to get you guys a room? That's cool. So you've been running with him for a while? Hey you know. Here and there. South America. Tells me for all the fun stuff. Wow. Leo. Have a seat. - Hello. - How you doing my friend? Well this is the guy I was telling you about. This meeting gonna be good. For the island. Well you know, my friend that I don't like having unexpected guest. I already got my crew here. He knows how I like to do business. Now, I tell you why. When the merchandise gets here... Shut the fuck up! Like I was saying my friend. I'll protect the merchandise until it's out of the port. Once it gets out... If you wanna do something freaky that's none of my business. Okay. Between the arrival... and its destination... there's a very slight window open. Yeah, don't worry about that. You know at the end of the day people are gonna get what they need. You can't move forward without fuel. And no one wants to be left behind. She can get it and give it to the people. God bless. Here baby, I got you a beer. It ain't that hard to track you down. All I gotta do is follow the odor of skanks. Letty. Life has a way of changing those plans. Change of plans. Where do we sleep? Excuse me ladies. That's right. All the way from Mexico, sucker. What? Who is this? Did I just hear you speaking Dominican? It's been a while since I've been back in the States. - You know that. - You're missed. She's alright. So what's going on? I know you're not training these boys for nothing. Have I arrived just in time for a new adventure? Letty you always get here just in time for something. Come on, what is it? I'll block you. You can't see. What are you gonna do? Oh my God, we're gonna crash. Oh no! What's gonna happen? Wait, this crazy. Rain one minute. Clouds the other. Sunlight next. Where you taking me? Wait 'til you see. Wait 'til you see. Come here. You feel that? How could you be 3,000 miles away from that? Can't.
