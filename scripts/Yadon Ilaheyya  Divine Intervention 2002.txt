This neighbourhood is the sister of a pimp Yesterday, I wanted to get my car out... ...and someone was blocking my way We are a decent lot, parking is a real problem I got this kid and told him "See if the driver is at your place" I lit a cigarette and waited Waited and waited and waited No one came I thought, "He must be sipping an arak" And then he shows up. He sees me He opens his trunk. He takes a Hoover, a dustpan and brush... ...he starts cleaning his car I said, "This is not good timing" Let's see how far he goes He cleaned his car front, back and front again He started to back out with the carpets, his ass like it was in reverse I got out I waited till his head was level with the door and banged it and banged it... ...till his head was as red as a monkey's ass "You want to clean your car?" My brother heard the noise "What's happening?" "Nothing, he wants to clean his car" The family came to help him out My brother said, "Stay where you are" He grabbed the guy and said, "Want to clean your car, brother of a whore?" He beat the shit out of him and knocked him flat Now the guy is in hospital, his ribs are all broken He wanted to clean his car, the son of a whore! That's enough. Stop it now In memory of my father
