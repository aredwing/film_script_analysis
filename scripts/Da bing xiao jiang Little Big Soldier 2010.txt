The 7 largest states were known as Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei and Qin. The rest was nearly wiped out a hundred years before the unification. Qin then conquered Han and Zhao subsequently. Year 227 B.C. When Wei's troops marching towards the state of Liang. they were ambushed by Liang at Mt. Phoenix. Both sides suffered heavily. Death toll reached 3,000. Third bro. Third bro. You're not lucky as I am. - General! - Who are you? Liang's soldier. One main road leads to homecoming My home is right at the foot of Mt. Liang Soils are rich there Pretty good. 5 acres of farm What to grow? Let me tell you something. When I was a boy, I caught a boar. My dad had me let go of it. You know why? There were other boys inside that belly. You have boys? You know what, you're my captive now. You've lost few blood. Not a big deal. This is the drug developed by my family. Don't spare this to anyone. You hurt? Now it gonna hurt more. You're welcome, young man! You'll live, you know. And don't curse. My dad said, Scratch when you're itchy, Smile when you ain't lucky! Pretty good. General. Deputy General Yu. Yes, I am. Hang on a sec. Why you're here? In pursuit of Liang's. In pursuit? How many have you killed? Speak. One. - My men must fight hard. - Liang's came hard on us... Defend our nation with our lives. - Please, for the sake of... - AWOL personnel must face penalty. General, my company was all gone last night. Gone? I was there last night. In fact, we were ambushed. And you were the traitor. You're so cruel. He saved your life, and you took his. What you gonna do? He was right. You're all dead. Kill me. I don't kill POW. Now, keep begging. I might let you go, if you tried hard enough. Just kill me. You really want to die? Here, let me help you. Too bad, I failed my mission. Want to die? Die another day. Prince Wen, we've accomplished. Like he said, to die with dignity in a battle field. You're AWOL. Not exactly. Just playing dead. My dad said, no shame for living to fight another day, only for being dead in vain. Poor Third bro didn't listen to me. He refused to play dead. - How much am I worth? - It doesn't hurt to tell you. General alive, 5 acres of farm land. I have a jade medal in possession. How much is this broken thingy worth? A lot. I'll keep it as a gift. But I don't believe you. He's one of us. Still alive. We were ambushed. Anybody home? Anybody home? Someone, bring me meatloaf and liquor! A big shot like you, what would you say now? "Absurd! Take him outside for beheading." Nothing to eat in here. General, spare me. Liang's archer and infantry unit: Ambushed our 1,000-strong elite unit. Both sides were totally wiped out. This is the sword I gave him. But where is he now? I believe we can find me. Wu, only if he's still among the living. War is everywhere now, where else you can go? General, have you heard of Shen Shu? The one in Mt. Phoenix? A fortunate-telling tree. Is he your captive? He's my luck. Hang in there. We're almost there. How far? Small potato. Don't make me do this. Don't. Don't push your luck. Give me liquor. - No can do. - Liquor. You've fought many battles, haven't you? Many. You can say I'm a big time warrior. Untie me. Then you must have killed a lot. Just too many. Fought against 8 men at a time. Like yesterday. General, would you take me too? I'd like to become your captive. Okay. I know some musical. General, keep drinking. I'll entertain you. - If he turns out to be alive, what then? - Keep in mind that he's already dead. Why? General, you've killed so many. I'm not a General. My family were killed by yours. And I live to sing against my will. I'm supposed to give you a good time and serve you, General. I didn't take pleasure in drinking with you. No more fight. Open the gate. I'm a soldier. I have taken a Wei's General... Stop. Whose this head? A General of Wei. That's him. I'm sure. That's a head of Wei's General. Reward him. Just a sec. Who killed him? I did. Really? He must be an AWOL. Cut off a dead man's head. Behead him. That's not true! Where's the horse? You gonna have to kill me if you don't let me go. Or I'll kill you in a heart beat. Kill, kill, kill. I grow farms. I don't kill and I don't want to kill. You're getting me mad. I'm not gonna kill you. Can't believe I just got fooled by some woman. I gave her food to eat, and she gave me pill to swallow. You deceived her first, so it sounds fair. She should have hit you instead. Stupid helmet. What did she say to you last night? You small potato. Who's stronger, me or him? He's a natural. - So I'm nowhere to compete with him? - You're too soft and he got the heart. To become the King, you must learn from him. I'll take a unit and head for Liang's. Why don't you go back... I won't go back until I see him. You know what, I've been looking forward to life of peace and farms to grow for 20 years. The wagon is not here. The rope was cut off. Stop playing dead. I'm too smart for that. We better stay away from the main road. Let's take a detour. Like this track. Just don't lose the map. Strong liquor. Must be Liang's. One small track leads the way to home. What now? Like my dad said, step in shit. Something good awaits me. It's an ambush. I get it. What's loaded on that wagon? Nothing particular. Rip him. Rip him off! - Wait, wait... - Who are you? A General. Says you. Beat him. Beat him down. Stop! Stop! Stop! Sorry. Please... stop. Take whatever you want, just let us go. What possibly do you have, besides this piece of junk? I want revenge! Shut your mouth! Who's this guy? He? He... he's my son. No! I'm not his son... You little prick! He's crazy. He thinks he's going to war. I'm taking him back to grow farms. Grow farms? There's nothing left to grow because of the wars. - Revenge! - Get lost! I'm in charge here. I say we take the wagon. Unfaithful prick! You got a death wish? This helmet will get you killed. - How about this? - This? Will you ever learn? Let's go! Bunch of fools. They had no idea you're the MVP "Most Valuable Package" here. Your son? I'm gonna treat you good! So tie me up and take me back to your farms! Don't move. Don't breathe. You were trying to strangle me to death? If it wasn't me... Prick! It's not Dim Mak. My dad was right. I stepped in shit. Pretty good. Don't hurt us. I'm begging you! Hold it there. I could kill him, or I could spare him. I just have the power. How about 2 acres for beans, No! 3 acres for beans. Tell me, what I should do with I can offer you a thousand acres. That's too much. I couldn't handle that much. White grain or bean, what to grow? I'd say rice. I love rice. White grain and rice are the same thing, fool! You tired? Feeling comfy, right? Now I'm relieved. Right, I'll need some buffalo. One male, one female. The male will work in the farms. The female will give milk. I'm dying to know how you're gonna drag me all the way to Liang's. Wait, I can't milk a cow. So I'll need a wife who can do that. My eldest brother was a great warrior. He fought till death. My second brother was a honest person. He died on the battlefield as well. I'm the last seed of the family. General, do you have any siblings? Wish I hadn't. Why are you taking me here? I couldn't find 'em. The Mt. Phoenix is huge! There's a lot of grounds to cover... Was he being tied up? Yes, his dad tied him up. Said he's crazy or something... They both appeared to be crazy... Can I go back now? Revenge... They want to take you back from me? It's not gonna be easy. I've been in battles for years, never seen an elegant arrow like this one. I've seen this. It's someone not friendly. People like you just asking this for yourself. You know, they have you and you'll die. I have you and you'll live. You are right. I don't want to die in vain. I'll come with you. Turns out General is afraid of death. If I die, I'll die with dignity. This way, or that way? Even if we make it to Liang's, I could make a truce with one condition: your execution. Don't fool me. Nobody fools me. Except that woman who drugged you. You have lots of women? Let's talk about you. What type of women you like? We have the lustful, and the educated. I like the honest ones. But I'd probably take the educated. She could teach me how to read. You don't have a woman, right? That woman, what did she say to you? I'll tell you, if you can make it back to Liang's. You guys, go down there. Back to where we came. Keep a lookout. Who is that? The Others. They're bound to their own rules. Go make your acquaintance. They don't speak our language. They are passionate people. Good fighters too. Better stay away from 'em. Hurry up, you don't look that tired. Birds are gathering around, but Phoenixes don't go with the flow. What chicken and ducks are you talking about? If a phoenix lost its fur, it'd make a chicken look elegant. You're good at throwing rocks. I used to hunt wild chicken with rocks when I was a boy. Hey. You know why our troops camped at the Mt. Phoenix? How would I know? Nevertheless, we had hidden there for 2 days waiting for you. That's what I thought, a set up. If it wasn't an ambush, my elite unit would have crushed you majorly and conquered Liang. Stop the nonsense. We are not that weak. Anyway, an AWOL like you, it's a shame to Liang. Now, see how you elite you are. General versus AWOL private? Liang versus Wei. Fair and simple. You want fair? Keep your hands off my wound. You have your wish. You're dead. You're dead too. We're both dead. Pervert. War is over. Wei won. Wars have been around these years. More people have joined the military. He kills him, and he gets killed by him. What's the attraction? Liang wins. Liang wins. You call this fair? It's war. No such thing as being fair. We'll soon have meat to eat. Now, have some appetizer. Lost your appetite? Fine by me. General, what do you eat when there is no war to go to? Meat and seafood. Any good food you can possibly think of. Now I get it. You people constantly go to war just because of digestion problems. Didn't you say you can't read? My dad taught me these 2 words. They are the easiest to write. These 2 words are not easy to write at all. Why don't you go to Wei with me. I can offer you a high position. I forgot to tell you one thing. General alive, the rewards will be farmland and money. No more serving in military. There will be no more killing for me. Just me and the farms. When there's a war, there's a winner. A winner of unification of China. Only that will put an end to wars. Only that will give you little people a normal life. You know what, we could have lived our normal life, if you had just left us alone! You really don't want a bite? Frankly, I'm a bit hungry. Here comes our meat! Wonderful meat. I'll get you firewood. You have babies. Can't eat you. My dad said... Let's go. Let's go! Someone is coming. Let's go! Why the panic? He's alone. It's our guy. Hey, bro. Bastard! You. Go that way. A Liang-made sword. On your Knees. I'm a Liang's soldier. I only knee to Liang's superiors. - Now what? - You are a scout from Liang's. Yes. - What about you? - I'm a scout too. What are you scouting for? I'm going to the battlefield at Mt. Phoenix. No... No survivors found. Why take the track? Your convoy is taking the main road... Track is faster... Pretty fast. I don't know him. What? He's got lightheaded after falling off from a horse. No... Yes, I fell... - Either way I don't know you. - What? You don't kill scouts. That's agreement during wars. Is this your sword? Yes. Why you're carrying a General type sword? I borrowed it... You're not a scout. No, I'm not. Where is the Wei's General? I don't know. Don't you lie to me! I know, I know. I've got your General. You got balls. - I got no balls! - Where is he? - He's fled. - You're no use to us then. No. No. I-I hid him. Take us there. - He's really gone. - Are you messing with me? Back off! You all back off! Back off! Stay back! - If I die, you won't get anything. - What do you want? Rewards. I can give you that. Shame on you. One of you is useless to me. Now what? Get him! Pardon me. Wu. Stand down. Let them through. He's still alive, isn't he? Pretty good. Just a General, not a big deal. Maybe I'd capture their King later. Am I really a shame to Liang? Am I? Come on. Come get me! I'm not dead yet. Didn't expect that, right? Because of your conspiracy, They'll haunt you for the rest of your life! And you. A pity man. A dishonorable AWOL. One main road leads the way to homecoming empty-handed! Where you come from? Where's your home? When I fulfill the conquest I'll start building my big boat. Yeah. I'm gonna sail off on the night of the full moon and travel the whole world. My father said, paint a dragon on the ship, and it'll attract a phoenix. The day you the Prince are crowned, you will get anything you want. To become a King, me and him we'd never be the same like before. Take some rest, Prince. My dad said, a sparrow could one day become a phoenix. Pretty good. Why did you trick me? I wanted to hit you. So kill me, General. I'm not a General. I'm a private. What's the difference? You just kill. Hey, you're lost, right? You really think that when you get to Shen Shu, everything will be all right? I'm a small potato. This map I have here, will get you to Shen Shu. You'll get a lot of grounds to cover. Take this horse with you. I give this back to you. You're hungry? Me too. Need to find something to eat. At the bottom of the mountain. Soils are rich. 5 acres of farmland 5 acres of fine land What to grow? - You're wrong. - You're wrong. Stop arguing. If you want to be a successful diplomat, you just don't one thing. What's that? Patience. Mister, please tell me which way is Wei. - That way. - No, that way. Wei has geographical advantages, with Liang acting like a front shield, and Chu like a shield on the back. You can run, but you can't hide. This is your new home now. I'm going home too. You live a good life. Pretty good. One main road leads to homecoming My home is right at the foot of Mt. Liang Soils are rich there... Pretty good. Pretty good. Easy, easy. I should have killed you in that inn. I should have let you be the black bear's lunch. Don't get too tight, you understand me? They're taking us to a tomb. Tomb? - Get us buried in mass grave. - Buried? How far is Liang from here? What village you come from? Three Legs Cave. Looks like your plan isn't going well. We'll see. You're still my captive. Hey, I'm not your captive. I'm his captive. Trade him with a horse. Prince, look out! Line up. - How to take this thing off? - I'm about to ask you the same question. Wu! I have an idea. Just say it. Remember, we're in the same boat. Yes, like my dad said, Whether it's a an eagle or a chicken, they are just meat once placed in a hotpot. Figured. Need help. Not a perfect idea... but still a good plan. Come on. - Wu. - Yes. You finally fight me with a real sword. Sorry, you're no longer my master now. What a pity, you're my best student ever. Get on it. Buffalo, faster. Prince, make your way out. - This way. - That way. Hey, you know what, I didn't want to save you. This buffalo just lost his temper. Was this buffalo too power or the wall was too weak? Not matter what, thank you. Pretty good. What's with your waist belt? My secret. Before we go separate ways, I'll have a secret to tell. You want to know why those people wanted to capture me? No, I don't want to know. People like you are so complicated. Since the day we met, everything has become complicated. Small potato. You're still my POW. Can't let you walk out on me! - You've delayed my business. - You're my business. I know, I'm your farmland. Yes, 5 acres of it. And the reward money. Yes, a pocketful of it. - Stop! - Why? - I'm ordering you! - You can't trick me! Thanks for the warning... This can't hold any longer. Get off of my back. Not a chance. I'll grab you after you let go of me. You think I'm that stupid? Let's find out. Wu. Prince. Why? He's still alive. Is that fate? Prince, let's head back to Wei. No! You don't how I feel. You really are some piece of work. Go ahead. Tie me up. Just take a look around. Take a look around at this hell hole! Where are we? Save your breath. We're gonna die down here. One main road leads to homecoming My home is right at the foot of Mt. Liang Soils are rich there You're loosing it. Pretty good. My dad said, as long as you still alive, it's pretty good. Must I become the King? You'll be a good King. It's a good thing for Wei. Are you trying to convince me to kill him without a blink of an eye? We've gone this far, this is only way out. Okay, how can he die with dignity? What are you thinking? Rapeseed flower. I'm thinking about growing rapeseed. Why? Why what? Why am I being stuck here? I should be the one who brings all the Dukes to their knees. And then have a huge tomb made for me. Have my own treasure buried with me. Now they can't even find my corpse. Yeah, the rest of reward money would go to my new pharmacy store. To be honest, your drug worked. I'm appointing you as The Minister for Health. You know what, if it wasn't the wars, we could have been buddies. Perhaps. If you make it out alive, will you promise me one thing? Shoot. Never invade my nation. I give you 10 years of truce. Sounds tricky. We have an agreement. And you need to promise me one thing. Shoot. If you ever make it out alive, you must tell them that I died fighting. I died fighting for my people. I've done nothing disgraceful to Wei. We all bite the dust, but not our flag. Don't lie to me, you small potato. Being a small potato... sounds pretty good. Wake up. Dad, I'm alive! Thanks Heaven! Thanks Heaven! You know what, this is Three Legs Cave. There is a fisherman's village nearby. I'll go get a boat. It'll take half a day to get there. To where? To Liang, where else could it be? Don't think about running away. You can't survive an hour without me. Quick, quick! Go hide! Hide from what? Just hide. Hold me up. Brother. Brother? He's your brother? You've been chasing me for days. Don't you get tired? Prince. Prince? Why the mourning bandana? It's for our father. He was very sick when I left for battles. It's you. It's fate. You just cared about waging wars to please the old man. If I hadn't upset him by making peace arrangement with Liang, I would have been the Prince. You set the ambush to make sure I'd get killed. Something going on between you two and we Liang paid with 2,000 lives. You're not authorized to talk to me. You're not authorized to talk to me. - Leave him out of this. - But he's the enemy. He wants me to live, but you wants me to die. Come on. Use that bow I gave you and claim the throne of Wei. You're still too soft-hearted. Your sword. If you don't kill him, he will kill you. Only one of you will become the King. That's doesn't make any sense, why one of you brothers must die? - It's none of your business. - You guys are complicating things. - I said "it's none of your business!" - It's all because of that nosy baldhead. I'm done talking. He really looks upset. Maybe we should go now. I'm really messed up big time. You do what you got to do, Master. Can we go now? General! Behind you! It's none of my business. What a pity. Not even one small rock? Don't get any closer, or you'd get blind. Big brother! Stop! I'm the one you should kill. I'm the one you should kill. Me and my brother, only one will walk out here alive. You don't understand what I'm saying, do you? How about this? This is what I got to do. Little brother! Big brother, am I dying with dignity? Sorry about our big boat. We can never build it together. Do me a favor. Help me bury him. We must carry on, General. We got half day. Sorry, I mean Prince. Your Wei's liquor is not strong enough. I know what you're thinking. I also know what you're thinking. - Pretty good. - We're still alive. You two reminded me of my own brothers. They were good soldiers. In fact, I wanted to be a good soldier. The first time we enlisted, we 3 brothers got no choice. The first tour lasted for 3 years. When we came back, our village had been burnt to ground. We became homeless. Before my dad died, he told us we had served our country. But when the wars will end? And he said, "kids, listen, one of you 3 brothers must live, in order to raise kids for our family." Now I'm the only one left. Having you is my biggest luck ever. I can't say the same thing about my luck. Don't ask. What she said to me the other night: "kama". What a little potato. Shen Shu, Mt. Phoenix. "Peace" "Mt. Liang" You know what, after this turn is Liang's soil. My brother wanted to befriend Liang, maybe he's right. If Liang's Duke spare my life, may be we could work something out for allying each other. Maybe, maybe. Maybe it's too late. Maybe. Nothing feels like home! That's your secret belt... I was wrong about you. Never thought you could make this journey for both of us. Now, am I your captive or enemy? Neither. Just go. Hurry. Before I change my mind. Why? You 2 brothers, one must live. Can I count on your word? What you mean? Absolutely! You have my word! Don't forget... that medal you took from me, it's worth a fortunate. It can get your farmland and money. I found it. I might not live long enough... Now I'm empty-handed. Pretty good. Run. Run away now. Ask him to surrender. Liang has been destroyed. Knee down and surrender. Liang is gone? How could that possible? Liang refused to surrender. So we, from Qin, destroyed it. - Your units have been completely eliminated. - On your knee. Last chance. All units wiped out? No more Liang. "Qin" This is not happening. Liang is history. I really got nothing left now. Put the flag down. One main road Your units have been wiped out. That's not true. Drop your sword. I'm still standing! Give your best shot! My home is right at the foot of Mt. Liang Soils are rich there 5 acres of farm Sorry dad, guess I'm not gonna raise any kids now. One big river leads to my home My wife, my kids and my big house Chickens and ducks are fat Cattle is strong Grow some bean white grain and rapeseed flower I ain't a shame to Liang, am I? "Liang" Qin conquered Liang. The General has returned to Wei and claimed the throne. Since then he gave up waging wars. When facing the invasion of Qin, Wei's Duke complied to surrender. Soldiers and civilians were left to life in peace. During the last few years of the Warring States Period, one China was nearly shaped. Qin united all states of China in 221 B.C.
