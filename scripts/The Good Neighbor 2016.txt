Ever-so-slightly in their lives. Nothing they would normally notice, maybe a passerby... On a bicycle or a waiter at a restaurant. Just little interactions set up... To alter the course of their routines. When the study was finished, the volunteers recounted... All the things that had happened to them. And some of them were seriously affected... By the message they were being sent. One woman started believing in god. But here's the thing. Nothing was done to them. Their lives had carried on completely unchanged. The only thing altered was their perception. People see what they're looking for. Uh... I'm gonna drum roll... Until you finish setting up the camera. Make you go faster. Come on. Okay. Uh... You done? You done? September 18th, 2014, terms and conditions of the experiment. Rule one, no physical interference... With the subject at any time. Electronic and mechanical equipment only. Rule two, strict deadline. Six weeks to prove hypothesis or the project is abandoned. Rule three, objectivity. No trick editing, no false narrative... Everything that you will witness... Will be 100 percent real. The theory, simply put, with the proper execution... It is possible to drive an unsuspecting person... Into believing that they are truly being haunted. Now in our case, the unsuspecting person... Is Harold Grainey, the creepy, psycho hermit... That lives across the street. We have reason to believe that something strange... Is going on in that house. Now the goal is to document the entire thing. Say, "hi, Sean." Whoa, dude, I'm not in this. Posterity, remember, this is the process. We have to document everything... And everything includes shopping... right? This is Mr. Sean Turner, residence surveillance expert. MIT-bound mastermind... Voted most likely to invent the next Facebook. Say hi to the kids at home, Sean. Hi, kids. Uh, tell them exactly what it is we're doing here. We are purchasing the last of our supplies. And supplies for...? For the surveillance room. Uh, surveillance headquarters. I.E. Your bedroom. Why don't you show everybody what's in your basket? Well? Ugh... all right, fine, here, take this. All right, just checking the color contrast, there we go. Stunning quality... absolutely stunning. Oh, man, great idea, Sean, spray painting indoors. Um, why don't you give everybody the run-down. Well, in order to fully surveil someone's house... Undetected with real-time audio and video... You need a high-speed Internet feed... And you need a few stealthy gadgets that are surprisingly... Easy to acquire, in fact, all of these came from Skymall. God bless America... Selling terrorist-grade spy equipment on an airplane. Exactly. This is a motion-sensor adhesive mini cam. It's WIFI-enabled, you can stick it to pretty much anything... It's like the same thing that the d.A. Uses... For undercover drug busts. This is a 2.4 GHZ mounted thin cam. It's controlled from a remote, it has zoom aperatures... And night vision capabilities. As for the disturbances themselves... These are pulse-control magnets... Electronic wire trips, fuse rerouters... This big guy here is a low-range Sonic emittor. These are ultra-range wireless audio bugs. Now all together, it's enough to control someone's lights... And home electronics from your fingertips. We route all of this together into... Mission control. Here, take this. All right, so, we have three monitors, four hard drives... One steady vantage point to watch us watching the subject. And of course, our beautiful eye in the sky... An objective witness cam. This set up has cost us a lot of time... A lot of Sean's father's money... Coming fully equipped with a digital editing bay. This is truly what's going to make this a goddamn masterpiece. Oh, wow, this thing got fucked up. Fascinating. How are you doing? I'm done. It's good to go. All right, it is 8:40 am, Saturday, September 19th. Our street cam is in position, and our subject is on his way... To his weekly grocery run... So that means for the next hour and a half... That house is ours. All right, and there he goes. Okay, let's do this. All right, go, go, go! You good, dude? Yeah. Okay, let's go, come on. Hey, dude! The ladder, get the ladder. Let's go, come on. Dude, go! Come on. All right, this place is fucking creepy. Anthony, you want to make yourself useful? I am, I'm talking with you. Hurry up! Sweet record player, Grainey. Huh... I guess that means no basement cam. Oh, shit! Ugh, stupid fucking cat. What? Well, all right, extreme home makeover time. Is it on? Yeah, but we gotta hide it better. Relax, it's fine. No, it's not, okay! And we gotta get out of here. I still have to plant the audio. Hey! Relax, it's gonna work. All right, I will work on this, you finish up. Hey, Sean, it's gonna be fine. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you exhibit c... The living room cam... The camera that ultimately captured the tragedy. And this is clip number one, September 19th, 2014. The first day of the so-called "haunting project." The haunting project? For lack of a better title. Yeah, for lack of a much better title. All right, seriously, and you guys can just do all that... Stuff from this room? It's brilliant, actually, I mean... I don't think that anybody has ever done... Anything quite like this. Except that they have. Okay, explain. Um, okay, how about a million movies and TV shows? I mean, like scare tactics, paranormal whatever... It's the same shit. Ashley, I... I don't think you fully understand... The scope of the project. I mean, we're not punking somebody here. We're driving them to question their own beliefs. I mean, this is real, right? Only it's not real, it's bullshit. No, Sean, help her out, okay? Give her the scoop. What you're talking about is fiction... What people think people would do... When confronted by a supernatural presence. Set up cameras, call a psychic... But would anyone actually do that? Short of an actual ghost being in the house... This is as real as it gets. Come on, every great filmmaker takes their own next step. And this is my next step. So, you're gonna torture some poor old man... That's the next step? Ashley, the fact that you just said that proves to me... That you have no idea who Grainey is. Okay, well, what does that mean? It means Harold Grainey is an asshole. Yeah, he's a psychopath. He's bat-shit crazy. I mean, he beat his wife until she left. Yeah, and now he just sits in the house all day... Drinking himself to death. Yelling at anybody who bothers him. What, because he doesn't let kids in his yard... You're gonna scare an old man half to death? Trust me, he deserves it. Why? I'm not gonna get into it. But there's other shit, too. He used to call the cops on us all the time, even as kids. And didn't he poison the Lindeman's dog? Yes, yes, he did. And he watches people. Yeah, he is an old, miserable, wife-beating, dog-killing... Drunk sack of shit. I mean, I for one, am not gonna lose any sleep over this. Well, what do you mean he watches people? I mean, he watches people, the neighbors. He just stands in the window and stares at them. Yeah, it's creepy. Even at night, when you can see him. Harold Grainey's a freak. He's probably watching us right now. Fuck you. I'm serious! Ten bucks says Grainey is watching us right now. We can see it right here on the Th... You guys! No, come on! Look, take a look. Take a look. Get on over there. Okay, so you see that beige house right there by Sanjay's? Okay, look up in the top left window. Right there, do you see that? The shadow? I don't see anything. No, babe, behind the curtain? Look closer... closer. What the fuck? Ethan! Fucking asshole! I told you, you'd be surprised. Turn that light back on. All right, it was not that funny. Oh, it was that funny... Sean? Nice. Day six, first incident, we're gonna call this one light's out. Now as you can see, I've... Wait. Cat... oh, damn it. Here, take this. I can change to the ceiling cam. No, no, no, this shot is better. Uh, do not enter. I told you not to point that thing at me. I just told you not to enter, so... Why are the lights so low? Do you need something? I'm on my way to work, there's money on the counter for pizza. And Sean, don't let him do anything stupid... And can you at least try to hide the beer? Yeah, noted. Wait, can you shut the door, please? Okay, start from the top. Wait for the fucking cat to move. Come on, baby. All right, you ready? Oh, shit. Grainey, you okay? So now what? Well, now we wait. I don't want to drink any more of that beer. Why, you want a fucking Zima or something? No, it just tastes like shit. Okay, I'll be sure to get you something frilly. You can get a Cosmopolitan or something. Bottled diarhea or something. Well, it's a man's beer... So it makes sense that you don't like it. Fucking pussy. Oh, it's so terrible, isn't it? I just puked a little bit. In your pants? No, I'm good. Dude, he's sleeping. He's not sleeping. Look at him. Do it! Is he gonna move or...? Where you going, Grainey? Yeah. Oh, shit. What's going on? Dude, turn the lights back on. Yeah. What the hell is this? Evening, sir. Evening. I'm responding to your alarm that went off a short while ago. What alarm? You're getting this, right? Yeah, but we don't have any audio in the foyer. Jesus. No, it hasn't worked for 15 years. Well, maybe it's just an electrical disturbance. We are required to respond. You mind if I come in? Um, yeah, yeah, I do. Sorry? I said, "yes, I do." And the only disturbance I've had tonight is you. All right, I'm glad you're safe. Thank you. Have a good night. Thanks for your concern. Holy shit, did you just see that? What do you think he said to him? Please state your full name and occupation for the jury. Christopher Todd Palmer... Officer in the Ashland police department. And how did you first come into contact with the accused? I was the first officer to respond to the scene that night. Officer Palmer, would you please describe for the court... Exactly what you saw when you entered 614 covered bridge road? After responding to the call, I canvassed the house. I entered through the open front door with my weapon drawn. I was the only officer there at the time. And what did you find when you entered the house? I heard a noise coming from the living room... So I approached. That's when I saw the defendant standing over a body... Covered in blood. Harold? Harold! I know you're in there! Whoa, check this out. Hey, dude! Dude, hey! Wake up! We got a visitor. Here he comes. I need for you to sign these. I can see your car out here. Hey, what the hell just happened? Crap, I don't think our video card driver... Likes our surveillance software. We... we have to get this! All right, you said this would work! Yeah, I know, I'm not doing this on purpose, it just... Oh, there, it was just interference. I wonder if this is the infamous ex-Mrs. Grainey? Thought he would have poisoned her, too. Okay, fine, Harold! You win... again! What she leave there? What the hell is wrong with him? What do you think so far? Uh, it doesn't really matter what I think. Objectivity, right? Yeah, but you're the social scientist here. I mean, what are your observations? Uh, honestly? Yeah, honestly. I think scientifically... It's interesting enough just watching someone. Uh, you know, observing someone in their natural state... Uninfluenced... there's something fascinating about it. Yeah, kind of. But, uh... that's not what we're doing here. Remember that? Damn it! Son of a bitch! Rocky... rocky! Get out of here! Get out of here, you half breed! Shut up! Get him out of here! Hey, come on, what's the problem here, man? What's the problem? Well, the problem is your dog is pissing and messing up... My property. Let him piss on your property, okay? Come on! Easy, easy! Maybe I should teach him a lesson. Keep that son of a bitch on a leash, okay? 'Cause the next time, if it happens again... I'm gonna cut him in four pieces and send him home in this can. Let's go, boy. Let's go, boy. Come on. Mwah-hah-hah! Harold? Harold? This screen door won't stay closed. It keeps popping open. The kitchen is a mess. I have to get groceries. Do you think you can give me a hand? You know, I really need your help around here. I mean, just... just once, for me, just something! Can you at least fix this door? See you tonight, Grainey. Ashley, you've never even been camping. Why would you... why... you just bought that for no reason? Quiet, I'm on the phone. Why are you drawing dicks on everything? It's my "faux de cocks". What? No, no, Sean's just filmin me right now. It's so immature. Reprimanding me. On so many levels. Because I've got cocks on my wall. Well, no, they weren't... I drew them on the wall. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is part two of a segment... That I like to call "knock knock". You ready? All right. Go, and ready, and wakey-wakey! There we go, that's a good little boy. Here he comes. He's so confused. Why isn't he moving? I don't know. Let's speed up the door. Okay. What the fuck? Where's he going? Why doesn't he care about the door? Not in his bedroom. He's not outside, I... The garage. Shit. I told you we needed a camera in there. I mean, this is one of these vital moments where... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Is that... Jesus fucking Christ. He's fucking crazy. Holy shit. What the fuck? Is he... is he looking at us? Holy shit, dude! Hold on! He knows! He does not know! Just hold on! Of course, he knows! Look at his fucking eyes! I mean, he's probably coming over here right now! Sean, hold on! Relax. Zoom in. See? He's just staring at the wall. Now this guy is fascinating. Ethan? Wait, where is he going? He's going outside. Check the other cameras! Okay. No. No. No. Well, where is he? Ethan? You swear he didn't see us? Uh, maybe he'll leave. Okay, take the camera. No, I'm not gonna take the camera! We need to hide, man! Shut up! Just take the camera! Are you fucking kidding me? What? He's not gonna kill two people on their own door step. He's not that crazy. You're sure? Okay, if this is done, then it's done. So we either call the cops... Or go to the door and see what he wants. Either way, if you don't record this... I'm gonna come back here and kill you myself. Shit. Ethan. Dude, no! Ethan! Ethan? Ethan! There you are! I get one night with you... And I have to spend it coming across town hunting you down? Why didn't you answer your phone? You crazy old man. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Get you in the limo. Fuck, I... Jesus, man. You have a problem. It's 10:00 in the morning. I... I... We are 11 days in. Some definite incidents to report. Uh, this is the first time that Mr. Grainey has not left... His house at the usual time in four weeks. Also, a few slight hiccups in our disturbances. The first of which was alerting the police... With our electrical interference. And the second, and more interesting being... What can only be described as a psychotic, violent assault... On the old man's own property. Uh, one thing is for sure, it doesn't seem that he suspects... Any human interference, but his behavior is definitely changing. As such, the experiment at this point, can only be described... As a success. I just think we should be careful. Why don't you tell everybody why you feel this way? Why don't you turn the camera off? I'm just saying, why do you want to stop this? Oh, let me guess, you're afraid that it's actually gonna work. Hey, Sean, honey, whose house are you at tonight? My mom's. And is she cooking you dinner? Uh, no, she's working late again. Well, then, you're having dinner with us... again. Great. You know who little Albert is? It's some weird way of introducing me to your dick? We learned about this in psych, dude. Back in the 20's, Johns Hopkins university did this messed up experiment on behavioral conditioning in infants. The baby they used was called little Albert. They would set little Albert on a mattress... Next to a white lab rat. At first, he just played with it. He didn't have any reason to be scared. But after a while, every time he touched the rat... It would startle him. Ringing loud bells or whatever. And Albert would cry. Eventually he started to associate the rat... With frightening sensations... And whenever he saw anything that looked even like a rat... With or without the sound, he became terrified. Okay, help me out, because I know you have some point here. My point is... be careful how far we push this guy. We're creating something that isn't what it seems. It can do more damage than you think. All right, boys, it's almost ready. I'm just saying... they never cured little Albert. All right, so tonight, we're gonna take things down a notch. Maybe slamming doors was a little bit too much, too fast. So, we've come up with a new haunt. It's always a classic, and relatively harmless. Now as you'll notice, our old man fell into another... Whiskey-drenched slumber. Well, that is a shame that we're gonna have to wake him up. This little number I like to call, "the moonlight sonata". Oh, wow, and this could not be more perfect. Sean, if you'll do the honors. Dude, oh, my god, that's... What are you doing? Carrie, what are you doing? I'm dancing, Harold. Carrie, it's 3:00 in the morning. Is it? You're drunk, Carrie. I think on a night like this I'm allowed to be, don't you think? No, I don't, I think you should be in bed. So I can wake up tomorrow and everything will be better? So you're being... No! I want to dance! Listen to me. No! Oh, my god! The neighbors are gonna hear us. Do you think I care about the fucking neighbors? What are you doing? What are you doing? Hm... that's interesting. At least he didn't hit it with an axe. All right, it's 11:40 pm. And Grainey just unlocked the padlock... And went down into his basement. Check it out. What the hell is a 150-year-old man doing... In a basement at midnight? It's not the lock that matters, Sean. It's what's worth locking up. I mean, Grainey doesn't even lock his front door... But he locks his basement? Isn't that strange to you? Yeah, no, that's definitely strange to me. And there's something mysterious happening... But I also think we need to maintain objectivity... Which is one of our rules, and not jump to conclusions, so... Man, we're gonna be so fucking famous after this. What, man? We're gonna be so fucking famous. I think people are gonna find it interesting, absolutely. You're gonna be famous in your lifetime... It's 'cause you're YouTube famous. 'Cause you made like make-up tutorial videos... Or candle reviews. Dude, you know what? I respect the candle reviewers. I mean, come on! Hah-hah-hah! What? They got viewership. I mean, I would give the world for a million views. Yeah, of course, you would. This goes out to all the people that gave me one million views. Captain's log, day 13. Our fearless leader has succumbed... To a six pack of keystone light. But we must forge ahead and film absolutely everything... For posterity. This is Ethan, asleep... Across from a video of an open doorway. Exciting stuff. Notice the drool forming on Ethan's pillow... Next to his face. We'll keep that for the director's cut. This is Ethan's shoe, which features a crudely-drawn... Flock of peni for some reason. Let's play a game called... How many things does Ethan have open on his computer... Slowing down our video feed. Okay, let's do this. World news, close. Buzzfeed, close. Reddit, close, Facebook, Spotify, Netflix... Close, close, close. Pornography... of the Asian variety. Unshaved, uh, very discreet, Ethan, close. An IMDB search for... 'Mac and me'. Close, and... Dude, dude, dude, dude, wake up. What? Get up! I gotta show you something. Here, take the camera. Fuck... what? Okay, so, this is Grainey going down... To the basement at 11:38 pm. Okay. This is Grainey now. Live feed. Okay, yeah. And this is Grainey coming out of the basement. Okay, I... Note the time difference. 6:55 am... so he was down there all night? Seven hours. I mean, what the hell would he be doing in the basement... In the middle of the night for seven hours? Oh, wow, do I detect some actual enthusiasm in your voice? And not whiny hesitation? Any opportunity to be an idiot. Okay, it's day 15, 2:10 in the morning. Got a very interesting one for you tonight. This one is called "cold spots"" now the original idea behind this was to kill the thermostat. To mimic the drop in temperature brought on by spirits. But Sean here had the ingenious idea for the windows. Sean, if you will. Okay, so, there's a chemical solvent that you can make... From an alkaline battery which, among other things... Causes glass to crack in the cold. It's essentially an anti-anti-freeze. Uh-huh, and Sean spread it all over the windows... The night we broke in to Grainey's. Now we've already killed the heater... And it's about 36 degrees outside... So as you can imagine... That bedroom's gonna get pretty fucking cold. It's kind of beautiful watching an old man sleep... Thinking, you know, what he's dreaming about. World war 1. You falling asleep? No. Better not be. Quitter. Quitter! Yo, dude. Hey, Sean, come here... I want you to see Grainey's face. What? Come here! Look, look at Grainey's face, right there, what do you see? Uh, I don't see anything. No, here... right there. He's shivering. Come on, man, this is kind of fucked up. No, he's... he's not shivering. He's saying something. The audio, can you... Yeah. Got it. What are you... Ssh, ssh, ssh. Fuck! Oh, shit! You, in the hallway now! You turn the camera off! Fuck... Are you out of your mind, Ethan? Have you listened to what I said? Right, I'm sorry, I just... I... Sean wanted to see it. How could such an elaborate scheme be executed... Right under your own roof for upwards of six weeks... Without the least of your objection or interference? Honestly, I never knew what they were doing. You never knew what they were doing? Your son and his friend spent an average of 50 hours a week... In your son's bedroom... With a professional grade equipment hub... That you didn't purchase, and you never once inquired... As to what they were up to? Of course, I asked. Sean said his father bought the computers for him. His father had money. Had Ethan and Sean ever gotten into trouble before? Sean? Never. But Ethan... He got into some trouble after his father left. But meeting Sean this year... It's just been such a good influence on him. And trust me, when you're a mother... You would so much rather have your son... Sitting with his friends in his room with cameras... Than out god-knows-where... Doing drugs and drinking and getting into trouble. But would you agree that they still found a way to get into trouble? Objection, your honor. Argumentative. I'll rephrase. At no point during your son's six-week experiment... Did you ever become concerned... That any of their actions could get them into trouble? When I came home that night... I noticed that Ethan had gone through my closet. And why did this concern you? Because that's where I kept his father's gun. It's working. Hey. I wasn't sure if you'd make it. Um... She'll be home soon. Yeah. We have time. It's freezing in here. Dude, he's just sitting there. What the fuck? Okay, so, not only did "cold spots" work... But it yielded a much more interesting development. Now we're both convinced that our haunts... And Grainey's basement are somehow related. And he's been down there for a couple hours, so... What do you think is down there? What about his wife? Hm? It can't be, we already saw her. Did we? Yeah, we did. Yeah, well, how do we know that was his wife? Maybe it was just some old woman. Yeah, but, nobody visits Grainey. Why would some old lady just be pounding on his door? Who the hell knows? I'm just saying, add it to the board. You know what the weirdest thing about this is? No matter what we do to this guy, he never calls the cops. Or does anything about it for that matter. Would you call the cops if you had a body in your basement? Don't you think it's weird? I mean, after everything that's happened to this guy... He's never once seemed afraid. Oh, here he comes. Mark it, dude. What time is it? 8:28 am. Okay, so that's... An hour and ten minutes in the basement. All right, Sean, you know what needs to happen now, right? No way, dude. Yes. No! Sean... We're not going in there. We have talked about this. Yeah, and I said the same thing then. There's no way. All we have to do is find a way past the lock. No, actually, because even if we break the lock... Which he'll notice... We still have to get in there when he's not home. And Grainey never leaves the house. Who's to say when he's gonna be leaving again? Listen, all I'm saying is we have a film to finish. And you and I both know... That there's something going on in that basement. Okay, and I have reason to believe that we're not... The ones committing the crime any more. Ethan... Sean, come on! We're this close, all right? Don't let me down on this. Seriously, how can you live with yourself without knowing? Well, we're not going when he's there. Okay, yeah, deal. And we still need to find a way past the lock. Yeah, so we'll find a way. All right, well, any ideas? I don't know, man, you're the one going to MIT, all right? It's a problem. Just find a solution. Okay, so, here's the thing. Maybe we don't need to go into the basement. What? Not if we can get someone else to go in there for us. Why am I filming this? What? Because. Are we on? Yeah. Grainey still out? Grainey hasn't moved all morning. All right, then. Let's go. Come on. All right, I want you to go back in my room, call my phone... If Grainey even moves, then you tell me, okay? I'm gonna plant this bug... And you let me know when you hear it, okay? I'll be back before you know it. Okay, I can see you. And Grainey still hasn't moved, so you're all good. Hurry up! Come on. Ethan can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, no, you're all good... But you should come back now. Uh, just two seconds. I gotta get it hooked on this thing... Oh, shit! Oh, come on! Right now, really? Fuck. Whoa. Ethan? Yeah? Yeah, I can't see Grainey, so... You need to come back now. Okay, okay. Oh, he was just taking a leak. Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck. Run, run, run, run! All right, Sean. Ready to give Mr. Grainey a awake-up call? Hi, yes, Ashland police department. I hope this works. Don't hope it works, Sean... Expect it to. Mr. Grainey. I hope you're well this evening. I was sleeping. Does this sound okay? Yeah, ssh, yeah, it's fine. I was trying to sleep. I'm sorry for the late hour. I just wanted to make sure that you didn't hear anything... Out of the ordinary tonight while you were sleeping. Anything at all? No, I didn't hear a thing, so, if you don't mind... The reason I'm here is because we got a noise complaint. About a woman screaming. Well, I... In your basement, sir. In my basement? Look, we got a call. Apparently one of your neighbors was walking his dog... Said he heard a woman screaming in your basement. That's absurd. Well, then you wouldn't mind if I come in to take a look, right? Just to be thorough? Sure. Be careful. Let's see what you got down there, Grainey. Moment of truth. It's just storage down here. All right. I think we're good here. You sure they said it was a woman? That's right. Why? Nah... never mind. Sorry to disturb you again, sir. Yeah. You gotta be kidding me. He didn't find anything? He wasn't looking hard enough. No, no way! We're not going in there! We're not! Say it again, Sean. Fuck you. No, come on, say it to the camera. Sean, obviously it's bothering you... So let's talk about it, okay? On the record. You know what I think. What, you think I'm ruining my own project? I'm sorry, our project. I think you know you're ruining it... But it's easier for you to blame me. We wait until he leaves, we knock that goddamn door down... And we see what's in the basement. Documentary over, it's that simple. Unless nothing's in there. There's... Then documentary ruined... Burglary charges, and a waste of all of our time and money. We have one more weekend, okay? One more haunt. We move the furniture around, just like in poltergeist. Just like we planned. No, no, it needs more. Come on, doesn't a part of you need to know what's down there? Sean, let do something different? Let's do something dangerous? Let's do something your daddy's not gonna approve of? What? No, it's just funny that you should put it that way. What? Do you want to get into what this is really about, Ethan? What do you mean? I think you know what I mean. No, Sean, please, enlighten me. I know about Grainey... And your father. What did you say? You heard me. Now do you want to turn the camera off? - That was the afternoon of October 22nd, 2014. -40 pm. What did the two of you discuss... After the camera was turned off? Should I repeat the question, Sean? He told me the story of what really happened with his father. A story you never heard before. Yeah, this all happened before I moved to the neighborhood. But Ethan would always tell me that his father left him. And what prompted him to finally tell you the truth? I found an email open on his computer from his father. He always said that he never talked to him... So I thought that was strange. I shouldn't have read it, but... What did Ethan tell you? Well, um... his mom and dad were having problems. One night, things got physical, it was pretty bad. His mom ran out and went for help. And who's house did she run to? Mr. Grainey's. Harold Grainey interfered in a domestic dispute... With Ethan's parents... Causing an altercation of his own with Ethan's father. And when the police arrived, Mr. Grainey's testimony... Sent Ethan's father to jail that night, correct? That's right. Well, it doesn't sound like Mr. Grainey did anything wrong... In that scenario, does it? No. It doesn't. And what ended up happening with Ethan's father? Well, um, the way that Ethan told it... Grainey had a long talk with his mom that night. By the time his dad got out, she wanted him gone... And filed for divorce. And full custody of Ethan. Yes. So despite Ethan's father's obvious responsibility... In this particular incident, to a 13-year-old boy reading... These emails, it would seem that an old man interfered... In his life and that his father was taken away. It's quite a good reason to hold a grudge, wouldn't you say? Objection. Speculation. Is it not a fact that Mr. Grainey had a conversation... With Ethan's mother the night of the altercation? And that Ethan never saw his father again? Yeah, no, but see... No one was ever supposed to get hurt. So Ethan never implied that the man he referred to as, quote, a "miserable, wife-beating, drunk piece of shit"... Should be punished... Even to the point where he might react violently? No, it was just a prank... An experiment. Here's to my mom working nights, because if she didn't... We couldn't actively make bad decisions at my house. Give it up. One, two, three! Hey Carly, how's that Tequila treating you. Really good. Hey, give me the camera. No, man, why? Everyone's gonna see this. Ted Spiegelman, ladies and gentleman. Gobble, gobble. The guy that dressed up like one creepy cock. Biggest cock. That you are. And you're the only person to actually dress up... Well, besides Ashley, who dressed up like a... Slutty witch? Yo, hey, man, I was doing good, come on, give it back. Okay, so he disappears for, like, two minutes. And then he comes charging out of the garage... With this giant fucking axe. Shut up. No, no, seriously. So wait, wait, wait, so he takes the axe... And he walks over to the door, and then he just destroys it! Just like whack! Whack! Whack! Like Shelley Duvall was on the other side. Who? Never mind. Okay, why don't you put that thing down now, Ethan? Uh-huh, you know I'm seriously considering it. Just uh, two seconds, I gotta go find Sean. Wow, guys. I don't know if that's more stupid or racist. What? Sanjay's from Malaysia. They don't wear fucking turbans. Whatever, man. Asshole. Whoa, um, ow, ow, hi, Carly. Um, are you having fun? Ethan, I have to apologize. I gave you shit about your project... But it actually seems pretty awesome. Well, thank you. It is pretty awesome. Do you actually think that he's a murderer? Well, Carly. You'll just have to wait and see. Right, Sean? So, is there a place where Sean and I can go... To get away from all the cameras? Oh, the cameras are bothering you? Okay, um, well, you could go to my room. Oh, okay, no, bad idea. Why don't you go to Sean's room? You have your own room here? Well, technically it's a guest room... But since Sean practically lives here... Sounds great. Um, well, you guys enjoy your privacy. I just get really frustrated... Having Ethan film everything that I do. It's really hard to get you alone, you know. It's like you're always with Ethan. Yeah, maybe too much, right? What do you mean? I just feel like what we're doing is getting a little... I don't know... dangerous. Well... Can't a little danger be a good thing? What is that? What? That. Oh, my god, shit, Ethan! Shit. What the fuck, Ethan! Enjoy your privacy? Are you kidding me? Just relax. Give me that! Turn it off! Stop! Relax! Relax? Relax? This is sick. Wait, wait, how long has it been in there? What, do you... you watch me sleep now? Sean, it was just for tonight. I swear. I wanted to see if you'd say something about the project. I knew you'd be in there... The project? Forget the fucking project, okay? Do you understand what this means? I'm sorry, I'm sorry about the camera, but, Sean... You don't get it, we're so close here. You're obsessed. Okay, I told you, we're not going in the basement. We were here to haunt the dude. Does he not seem haunted to you? Not enough, no. Well, it's enough for me. Okay, you got your revenge, but I didn't sign up for this. Sean, stop! Are you fucking kidding me? You were nobody until I picked you up, don't forget that. I had this idea and you had the brains and money... To make it happen. And look at what we've accomplished. So it's exactly what you signed up for... So don't act like it's not. I mean, would you be anywhere if it hadn't been for me? Would you have gone to any parties? Would you have been with Carly tonight if it wasn't for me? Would you have left your boring, nerdy, rich circle... And had any fun before graduation... If it hadn't been for me? Fuck you, Ethan. Fuck me. They're your cameras, Sean. Your fingerprints, traceable to your credit card. Is that a threat? It's the truth. All I've ever wanted from this project is the truth. So the world could see exactly what it is... The world is only gonna see what you want them to see, Ethan. Okay? Don't you get it? I mean, it's not even about Grainey... Any more, it's about you, and... Oh... I don't even know why I agreed to do this. I just feel... Dude, you know what? Feel however you want, Sean. That's fine. I'm sorry about the camera, that was a shitty thing to do. But you listen to me very carefully. Whatever happens here... you and me are in this together. Got it? Get the fuck out. Come in. Hey. Hey. Uh, hey, so, I'm sorry about the other night. If it makes you feel any better, Carly said she really liked you. So... what's up? I want my equipment back. What? The computers, the monitors, the cameras. I'll let you edit what you have so far, but I'm done. Are you're serious? I just said sorry to you. I mean, what more do you want? That's not what this is about. Okay, you know what, you're not thinking straight. Why don't we just take a break, we'll take a breather... Let's have some beers, let's hang out, let's... Whoa, whoa, fuck! Whoa, holy shit. No way that actually happened. That goddamn cat! I honestly can't believe that happened. Fuck! All right... It's over. What are you talking about? What do you mean? The camera is on the ground. So the whole thing is over. The camera's on the ground in the den. Grainey is asleep, in his bedroom. It's not that complicated. Seriously, Ethan... Sean, your cameras, your fingerprints, remember? Think about MIT. We know every inch of that house. I will be in and out in 30 seconds. It's not like we've never broken in before. Not while he was home, we haven't. Are you stupid, Ethan? He's asleep. And what happens when he wakes up? Do you remember what he did to the door? That was a door. Will you just hand me my phone? Goddamnit, Ethan! Are you actually crazy? Hand me my phone! No. If you were ever my friend, you would back me up right now. Now I will be gone for two minutes. Text me if Grainey wakes up. Oh, god. Okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go. No. No, no, no, no... shit. No, don't do it. Don't go down there. What is all this? Shit. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, shit. Shit, go. Come on, Ethan, get out of there, come on. Hide, Ethan, hide! Oh, no. Holy shit. Where are you going? Okay. Shit. Don't move yet, Ethan, I can't see. What the hell? Oh, god. Fuck. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! We just... He just... Ethan? Ethan! He... he's dead? Yeah, he is dead. He just shot himself in the fucking head. What have we done? Why? I just... I don't get it. Why? It's because of the bell, Ethan. It's because of the goddamn bell. No, we wanted to move something. That was part of the plan. The plan? We killed him! We didn't kill him. We... we didn't do anything. Yeah, we did do something, okay? Which means it's our fault... Which means we're gonna go to fucking jail... For a long-ass time! Just shut up! Shut up for a second, okay! Just let me think for a goddamn second, okay? Oh, shit, Ethan, your foot. Fuck. Our fingerprints are everywhere, okay? They're on all the cameras. Your fingerprints are on the bell. All over the house! The old man killed himself, okay? We were never here. Okay, so, so, you get the cameras... And I'll clean this up. We're gonna be fine, yeah. Okay... hey! Sean, look at me! Hey! Hey! Look at me! We're gonna be fine, okay? Let's go. Go. Come on. Okay, I got the... Oh, god. Oh, god. Sean, help me. Sean! Freeze! You, on the ground now. You, face on the floor, hands on your head. Sit up for me, please. Come here. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry. Come on. Come here. Come on. What do I... Okay, now, let's dance. Thank you. Oh, it feels so good to be home. You wanna go see? Do you want to go see Caroline? Let's go see Caroline. Come here. Who's this? Oh, my goodness. Oh. He's a sweet baby. Oh, sweet baby. Hey. Hey. I just came from your garden, was out there, everything's holding up great. How about you, how you holding up? I'm doing great. What do you think? I, um, I bought you something. What's in there? The idea is you open it. Mm-hm. Let's see, what is it? What is it? What is it? Ah... the one I've always wanted. Now don't be a smart ass. I mean, this is a real antique. Look, we don't need you yelling and screaming... Wasting energy for no reason. Sometimes Amy and I aren't here to hear you. You know, I just want you to know that... Whenever you need anything, I mean anything at all... All you have to do is ring this and I'll hear it, honey. And I'll come to you, no matter what, okay? Good. It works. What do you mean when you say that this was almost inevitable? Harold lost himself when Caroline died. He lost everything that made him happy. And twelve years is a long time to be alone. Are you implying that Harold had suicidal tendencies? What I'm saying is that Harold was hurting. And he was hurting himself. But I made a promise to Caroline... That I would make sure he was gonna be all right. But he wasn't all right, was he? No. He wasn't. And that's why you went to his home one final time... On September 24th? Correct. What did you bring him that day? I found a place for him to go. Somewhere where he could get proper professional care. Where he wouldn't be alone. It took me months to try to get him to sign the papers... It got to a point where he... He didn't want to talk to me anymore. Did he ever mention to you... Why he didn't want to receive proper care? He never wanted to leave that house. He said Caroline was there. Will the defendants please rise? Before I issue your sentencing, I want to remind the court... That in this state, we abide by the felony murder rule... Which states if a death occurs during the commission... Of a felony, any felony... The persons responsible for that felony... Can be charged with murder, regardless of intent. Mr. Fleming, Mr. Turner... Your actions, regardless of your intentions... Led to a man's death. It wasn't enough that you tormented a lonely old man... But then you were perverse enough to record it. Justice, in my opinion, would be the guilt of this tragedy... Punishing you for the rest of your lives. The law, however, can only punish you for so long. You've been found guilty of illegal surveillance... And breaking and entering, both misdemeanors. Since you are both minors with no prior records... I hereby sentence you to two years probation. 500 hours community service. That's it.
