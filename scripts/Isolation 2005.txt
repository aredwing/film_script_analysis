Bodies overgrow. - Can you see the lungs and heart? - What is the cause? Is a genetic abnormality is transferred to embryo . - As in these tests. - Did you expect this? No. Not my experiment. But am veterinary work for him. That's it. That's it. Liver... Kidneys... What is that? Is a fetus, Dan. The veal was pregnant. This is unbelievable. Are completely malformed. The structure is totally wrong. The skeleton is on the outside. What the fuck have you done? Never would have survived. What have you done?

Then I'll go with it. - Have you always lived here? - Yes, I inherited from my father. - What about your family? - We are six. I am the second. Three brothers, two sisters. A big family. And how will the boy traveler? Do you like? Would you like you you to them? Are you in some kind of romantic travel ? Outside a farm. If my brothers are, kill him. I dunno. You're right. It has become bad. I really do not know what the fuck was... Shit. fuck, Mary. Mary. - Good morning, Tom. - Hi Reilly. - How's it going? - Well. - Is yours the caravan road? . - Yes Are you upset, Dan? - You have caused a problem? - No. No, Tom. Well, Dan, but be careful , okay? It's okay. They can stay a day or two. - If so then I go .. - What could steal here? Times are tough . Heard throughout all the banks around here . - With that kind of damn car. - It's true. Can not mix with these people. It's not good business. You are planted here in your property with a manual, to lend kicking your own land. Want to tell me something in particular Tom? None. It was just a simple recommendation . Do you know that the vehicle is 1.5 km from the property Buckleys Orla O & apos; Dwyer & apos; s? - Yes, and we can not find. - How can you not find it? - It was not working today. - Was here yesterday afternoon. Was watching a calf. But he returned. - What time did you say you left? - I do not know. It was late. Good. If you see her, let me know . - Long they stay? - A couple of days. How many? - Me, my dad and my sister. - There is a place of rest in Kilmartin. It's okay. For me may be a night or two. But should leave soon. Maybe today. Perhaps now. Good luck, Daniel. What are we going to do? I closed this last night. Is she back? Returned at night without telling me . Stay away. The vet said it could be contaminated . Burn. Destroy. Where is the cow? Was not well when he left. - Like what? - I do not know. Like I have a fever or something. What is going on here? It will just tonight. Tomorrow morning will leave. 're Coming. Oh, my God. I will stay here to check everything. Go away. That's too fast. Jamie, so no. Wait... What is it, Jamie? I'm sorry. Got something. 's My foot. 're Burning. What is that smell? I dunno. We are on a farm. Is very strong. Do not listen. Do not pay any attention. There is nothing. - We checked. - No. - In here there is no going. - Correct. I know what happened. In utero veal grew spontaneously. She was pregnant. Problem. Something went wrong. Somehow it was defective. Wore these creatures. There were six. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... I think Orla lost one. - And is still alive. - Did you know this? Not everything. Come on. I do not understand. If the missing leaves the farm... thousands of cows will give birth to these monsters million. Be something unstoppable. Can not go. I'll put quarantined the farm. Slow... should be here. - Where is the other cow and calf? - There isolated. - I swear, Jamie... - What? - I was bitten. - Bitten? Have you been bitten? What was that? How deep is? There on the wall... A meter or one and a half. If there is something there, you're stuck. Have to go through here. Well, wait... can hunt. Dan, go toward it. - Do you see anything? - No. But hurry. Easy. In the North Sea if you recover a drowned corpse... van with caution because sometimes... - He ate almost all of his intestines. - Eaten? It's disgusting. Yes Help me.. Give me a hand. Easy. Gone. The creature... it must have been attacked, has gotten into her. She tried to escape. Somehow, he fell into the well and drowned . But in that slurry body gets cold, so he left. In search of a new host. Here. What is that? This degree of increased cell is outrageous. Was mixed with human cells. Orla cells. - Why is that? - Shut up. Shut the fuck up. That's impossible. My... The cells are assimilating. That creature can contaminate people. Is bite. We can not leave the farm. Can infect everyone. People do not know they have been infected . But their offspring... Children, mutated... Distorted, how are you things. This could eliminate to a whole generation. Your foot. Show Me, Jamie. No... please. - Stay away from me. - No, Jamie. - We checked. Now. - Quiet. You can not leave yet. Show me your foot. Away from me. I can help. Mary and I left now. I have you. No you can go. Feel sick. That is normal. No, I mean that there is something wrong . There's something wrong... What was that? Where is Jamie? Stay away! Get away! Creeps within them. 's Like a parasite. Hides within cows and grows. Then devours. We must find him. Grows too fast. We must stop it. What about the other guy? Where is your last cow? I'm Jamie. 's In the barn. Has to be in it. Has already given birth. We must find the veal. Do not treat them like animals, but as objects . Numbers. As your lab rats. Orla is dead. You destroyed my farm. Can you hear me? You're bad, wicked stupid. 'm Calling the police. This ends now. Can you hear me? You can not go. Was wrong. Infects humans. Oh, God. Jamie... Why? What have you done? Dan... killed Jamie, Dan. - He killed Jamie. - Where is? Should be here. Jesus, you can not. I will. Are you sure? Aim nearby. Help me. Cursed bug. Do it. Help me. Sal! Come over. Come on. Kill him. Fast. You can not... ... leave the farm. Saint Thomas Hospital Birmingham - England 4 months later. There... Do you see the head? It's okay. Want to know? Is a small. Beautiful and healthy small. No need to worry anymore. Have a perfectly normal baby.
