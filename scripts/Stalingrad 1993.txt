It will be the bloodiest battle of the century. Porto Corvo (Italy), August 1942. Hearts are trump. Yes Lieutenant. It must go on, always go on. Can't drink that warm shit. - You are completely in the sun. - Put up or shut up. Sit down. Excuse me, Lieutenant. No, you have to play spades, not Hearts. Keep going, Rollo. May I rub you down? - That's mine. - no no. - Who's got the trick? - Me. When are you going to throw away this camel piss? That's a goodbye present. You can get one for 10 Mark. For that i'll plant a plum on your head. You always have better cards, and i am so horny. We should leave him in the hospital. I think it was YOU who got hit on the Head and not him. This will be our last day here. - We are playing. - His wife will shit bricks. Lupo! He is not allowed to drink. - He's got a headache anyway. - That's a fine wine. What time is it? One o'clock. We can still go to the whorehouse. When I see these women here... - And the present for your wife? - It'll be quick. Roll Call. Calm down. Roll Call. Damnit. That's my bottle. Be Careful. (singing) Italian Wine! I can't see. That's a shitty watch you are trying to sell me here. It's water proof up to You still have to wind it up. We'll take him. Take the chair. We'll take him. And my coat? Come on guys, quick! - And my coat? - His coat? Watch out! Soldiers: In the name of the Fhrer I have to tell you: You have accomplished a big deal in Africa. You have pushed back the English to the Nile. The Assault Pioneers played a crucial part in this success. You were chosen, because you are the best. Never forget that. Now there are new tasks awaiting you. But before you become part of a new elite unit in the homeland, the Fhrer is going to decorate you for your special merits during the heavy and victorious Battle of El Alamein. Men, this is the new leader of the first platoon in the second Company: Lieutenant Von Witzland come here. The selected men may step forward to receive their Assault Badges. Battalion, attention! Lieutenant, award your men. What is the excuse for your delay? I visited your predecessor in the hospital. Heroes are never late. Remember that next time. Corporal, you want to be honoured in this array? - Yes, sir. - Don't award him. Battalion, stand at ease! Dismissed! Assault Pioneers, get ready to move out in 30 Minutes. Battalion, fall out! Don't go away. Take me with you. Move on. Viola! Ciao, Viola. Eh, Fritz, Grande amore? When are you going to marry her? Beloved Klara, Russia. between us. A huge distance. You won't be able to write me letters. Of course you can keep writing, but it will take a long time until your letters reach me. Will it be bad? If it were for you I would sit now in the office of your father and not in a box wagon. Forgive me and try to understand my happiness. The uncertainty is gone. My life has got a function and a purpose. I had enough of it and you had trouble with me. But the melancholy vanishes as i come closer to the front. And there are strong emotions appearing inside me. Feelings for you are burning inside me. If you could see me now, between all these glorious warriors. My subordinates, who I already love. Here I can only prevail because of proficiency. You would turn up your nose at the smell here. Are you stupid? You should give him ten. Come off it. Lupo played better than you even with a loose screw. He's a newbie, everybody loses in the beginning. Roland simply hasn't got a chance against me. (heavy accent) Hey, these are mine! German, do you speak it? Where is this fucking Train going? How about Stalingrad? It's alright, we beat Ivan. We'll take it in three days. Make a stupid face. Thanks. It seems as if the train hasn't even moved during the last hours. Yeah, it's a huge country. We will divide it between us after the war. I have already ordered ten bitches and one hundred hectares for me. Here?... ...Not even as a present. - Then stay in your piss village. Look at that! They are already working for us. Go go go! Faster! - What is "faster" in russian? - "Davai". And "Ruki verkh". That's the only thing you need here. Adolf is building highways for me to Kirkov, or whatever the fucking name was. This country is crying for trucks. Enough, Reiser. Awesome, how the Herr Lieutenant is sitting with us in the straw. May I ask you a question? Please. Is that your first tour? - Everybody has to start small. - Well in this case, have fun. I bet: That I will survive this War and you won't. What do you bet? In your case... two boxes of water. ok. How would he be able to pay you? It's nice here. Perhaps this isn't Stalingrad. Shall I carry you, Russian pig? Come on now! Move! I said MOVE you fucking dog! What's the matter with you? Stop that! I have to protest against the behaviour of your men. Well, protest then. Protest to the Fhrer at best. Lieutenant Witzland Assault Pioneer, Battalion 336 Welcome to Stalingrad. So now we finally have gathered all the specialists together. May I introduce you to Sergeant Pflger. You arrived from... ...from Voronezh. It's good to have you here, Lieutenant. Let's show 'em. - Cigarette? - Thanks. May i report an incident at the loading bay? I already heard about it. Do you like the Russians? Forget about it. The men are to take ammunition and hand grenades. After that: briefing for the company leaders. Your uncle, the colonel, is a good friend of mine. He has asked me to take care of you. "Gott mit uns" God with us is written on the belt of the German soldier. I didn't even notice that. Because there is no better task than defending the christian, occidental culture against the eastern bolshevism. And because of that the German Soldier is NEVER alone, as opposed to the Russian soldier who has no place for God on his belt. Even if he is deep in enemy territory. Mller, go! Yes, sir. They are firing on their own Men! Fucking artillery! down! They are nuts. Don't panic boys, follow me. This is our hall. We have to take this objective. We'll begin with their MG emplacement on the right. The Russians have respect for our 88mm Guns - Nothing visible? - That's always suspicious. Here, captain. We are at Frieda Cease fire. Where are the 5 assault guns? I don't see any, as always. at your command Herr Major. Everything is clear up to Target Fire only at command. And keep quiet. Is that clear? Come on, men. Follow me Fuck! Feldmann, you idiot. It's not my fault. Now everybody knows we're coming. I'm sorry. Shit! Erwin! Nothing can be done for him, he's kaputt. Take cover! They are better then ours. They never jam. Chin up! With this you can cut up the russians. Smoke them out. Take cover! Take cover in the bomb craters! Watch out, Gas Tanks! Come on, men. The enemy artillery shells are coming closer. Run already! What is it, come on! Keep going. I don't want to leave! Come out! Get a grip, Asshole! Leave him. Take his tag and come with me. If you won't come with me I can't help you. Die a miserable death then. Move on! I tried to warn you. Idiot. Follow me! Impossible, captain. There is no "Impossible". I need smoke grenades. Smoke grenades! We have to take out their gun. Smoke grenades, Fritz. He's right. You can't get through there. Feldmann, make up for your mistake. You wanted your wife to be proud of you. Let me go. No, let me go. I can do it. I know, son. We give you covering fire. Run! He owed me that one. Go! Show them. Pflger, from the left, Witzland, from the right. Vorwrts! Follow me! Cover us and shoot at everything. Go, buddy. Dieter. I shot him. Shoot, shoot! Put your hands in the air. Quick. Davai! I shot my friend! It was me! I shot him! - I want to die! - Shut up. Shut the fuck up. It was an accident. It's a common thing in close combat. If it had been a Russian you would be dead now. Mama, i'm leaving you. Mama, stay! What am I going to do now... we stay together? Mother... I... Pflger, come back! Keep your heads down! I need the petrol can! Next target: control room. At 1800, german time. I need two volunteers. - We'll do it, Captain. - Fine. Come on, push buddy! One, two.... GO! This is worth of an Iron Cross. It'll look good in the coffin. Take cover! Mother won't bear it if I die. There is my iron cross. Do it already. Do you want to lose 300 men? Vorwrts! Secure the entrances! Stop! Stop! I have crapped my pants. I have fucking crapped my pants. You are not the only one. (Hitler talks in the Radio:) I wanted to do it differently. I wanted to go to the Volga. to a place, a town. It has the name of Stalin, but this was not the real reason. It was an important strategic point. You can cut off 30 Millions tons of traffic there, the oil traffic. There the wheat streams from the Ukraine and from Kuban intersect and there is also an important route for manganese ore. It is a gigantic terminal. I wanted to take it. And we are humble. Because we already took it. But there is still resistance. Now, some people say: "Why are you not fighting?" I don't want a second Verdun. I prefer to use very small raiding parties. Time is not important. There is no ship going up the Volga anymore. THAT is the important thing. We should keep our eyes open for Ivan. "A tiny little raiding party. " - What was that? - There are 62 men left. And in the beginning we started out with 400 men. Why don't you tell everybody. To lift the spirits. At least we have Ivan's stove. Fucking stuttering, after the attack. I'd rather stutter, than have a cold ass. Ja. Congratulations. You are still alive. Yes, let's smoke. - I don't need liquid courage. - Asshole. What do you think? Nothing. If you start to think here, you will become mad. So i try not to think think. Scope. You have a button here. You push it and think about nothing anymore. Excuse me. Be happy that you are still able to cry. That means your engine is still running. What's your name? Mller. We have plenty of other Mllers. At least until the next attack. The super dangerous Mller. "G.G.M." Everything alright, GG? What is it? The Russians are trying to rescue their wounded. So I shot at them. The Russians are doing the same. Can anybody speak russian? Me, Herr Lieutenant. Ask if they accept a cease fire so that we can recover the wounded. That's forbidden. The captain won't allow it. Shut the fuck up. Stupid son of a bitch. That would be regular procedure. In this town nobody cares about that. Wlk, this is an order. Our commander wants to rescue the wounded. They agreed, but we have to go first. -I don't go. -Me neither. - Emigholz. - Yes, sir. Transmit the cease fire. We need medics. Biene 1 to Quartier. Ceasefire. We need medics. I go with him. You better stay here. It's ok. You look like my son. - How old is he? - Three years. Let me go. It's me. Kolya. I help you. You won't die. Bastards! Take cover! Shoot the windows! Damn! Hand grenades! - Don't fire! - Run! Don't fire! Cease fire! You'll get the Iron Cross for that. Who opened fire? Who opened fire? Calm down, son. The russians wanted to attack. So I fired at them. - Goddamnit! - He's right, Lieutenant. You'll get court martialed. Sure! In that case I will talk. "Forbidden communication with the enemy." He doesn't need a court martial. We just send him to the Russians. You will get in the newspaper: "In proud grief". Scumbag. You're an asshole. You are always sleeping. My shaving things. Who's got my shaving kit? You are one handsome fucker. For the Title of "Our Army". The food comes! False alarm. They fired at the food. - Mail. - Give me that. What's for dinner? Horse piss again. This is madness. They can eat this shit themselves. Don't complain all the time. Yes, I know. "German Beasts invade Russia." Rollo, i have something for you. You didn't get mail? She writes, that she got a boy. She has already written the same in the last letter. But not a single word about the cow that should be calving. She's not really smart. Not even in school. - But at least she's tiny. - so what She is kind. I'd like to know if something happened to the cow. Listen to that. Somebody stole eggs from the shed. These rabbles. Look who's talking... - You steal from the dead. - That's something different. At home there is no fighting. Here we have war. A here is a letter for you. Asshole. From you wife? Yeah, she keeps an eye on our home. Schalke beats Hannover 3:1. Alemania loses again. That's from the letter? After the war I am going to play at Bremen. I already had a test game there. Fuck your football. I own a canoe. My wife paddles while I am relaxing. So that she is quiet in the evening. I also have some. Bunnies or rabbits? Big ones. (broken German) Your boots... bad. Very cold, russian winter. I... make. I shoemaker. Father shoemaker. Grandfather shoemaker. Silence! What is "silence" in russian? Why? They are singing well. cake. Eh, Rollo. My granddad sends Beeswax for the rheumatism. Something happened at home? A bomb raid? Kind of. While I am putting my ass out here, my wife is doing it with a frenchman. He's a POW. But that's forbidden. How do you know? That's just slander. No, she wrote it herself. "I wanted to write to you personally". We wiped out the frenchies in six weeks! Now she is afraid. I will pay the russians back. But it's a frenchman. I don't give a fuck. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Shut the fuck up. His wife has an affair. Don't tell anybody. Fuck you all! You all hate me! Especially you, Lieutenant. You think I'm stupid. - Leave me alone. - You are the best. Without you we would be dead. You would heve won our bet. Lieutenant come with me! Secure the entrances. Damnit, Wlk, secure the entrances. Ivan is everywhere. We have to go down there. Reiser! Yes sir. We have no connection. Take the flamethrowers and go down. The two of us alone? We come with you. Wlk! Yes, sir. If we don't come back, fight your way out. Compare your watches. 7 o'clock. Why me? I'm a radio operator. Can I come with you? - Why? - Perhaps he's a lucky charm. Alright. Emigholz, get the flamethrowers. Get up! (German) You are surrounded. If I scream... you are dead. And you too. -Ruki verkh -"Ruki vyerkh"...At least say it properly. Dead? Of course, you are experts in killing. Shut up or I shoot you. In that case you go down too. You won't come out of here alone. Come with me. - not this way. - Don't try to... Let's make peace. I help you and you let me go. Why should I trust you? I could've killed you. - With this? - yes, with this. One moment! What's in the other boot? My spoon. You want it too? How come you speak German? OK. I give you my word of honour as an officer. Get me out of here and you are free. You go first. Sure. Slowly. - Everything ok? - Man, Reiser. We have to keep going. Reiser, I will never forget this. Und what about Emigholz? - Help me! - There he is. My leg! If he won't be quiet shoot him. Your leg will be ok. Well, Mller. Continue! We have to get out of here. Let's get out of this hole! - Did you see Germans? - They went this way. Take care. Thank you, uncle. MEDIC! What's going on here? Who is patching up the wounded? The russians broke through. It is the fault of the fucking Romanians. - Get me out of here. - Stay there. - I'll bring a doctor. - My boots. - Where is the doctor? - I don't know. Where can I find a doctor? Doctor! - I'm not a doctor. - You come with me. Let's go, do your work! Reiser, put the gun away! Should he die? What about the others. - Go on! - I am not a doctor. Shut the fuck up! Get going! The doctor is here. Help me. Put the gun away! May I give an explanation, captain? - Explanation? - We are coming from the front line. - Shut up. - He is our comrade. Where is Schrder? Where are you? And my bag? I demand a report about this incident. Of course. He's dead. I can't believe this. All the trouble was for nothing. You are arrested. Give up your weapons. What is going on? I didn't want to do that. I want to speak to the General. You think you're so special, don't you. But sure. It's your right. You goddamn Ivanlover. Lead them off! This is the situation, Gentlemen in brief: it's fucked up. The Russians broke through our lines the day before yesterday. And today they managed to break through in the south. Now they are trying to close the encirclement at Kalatch. So we'll end up in a pocket. Feel free to smoke, Krger. Help me. My men have been arrested. One was wounded. Reiser lost discipline and threatened a doctor. Is that supposed to be a report? We were encircled. The whole 6th Army is encircled! We are talking about a whole Army here and you are whining about a few men. That's not fair. The men believed in you and they fought on. Are we just a small flag on your map? Excuse me, General. - What is it? - About the hospital incident. Some of my men are trying to force... ...a better treatment ...with their guns. - Isn't that the young Witzland? That's an unpleasant story. Are we going to get court martialed? You won't emerge unscathed. Penalty Battalion, December 1942. The 6th Army has now been encircled for 4 weeks. You'll get used to it. What's the matter? Why is the road still not finished? - So much worthless sheet metal. - Do you like it, Rollo? Maybe you can touch it? Asshole. You brought us here. Save your energy for the front line. They need everybody. Everybody on the truck. Move on! You too. But I... That's an order! Because today it's Christmas you will all get a bit of bread. But only if you ask for it. Say "please", former Lieutenant. Please. Merry Christmas. Get out! Dismount! They won't reach the front line, that's for sure. Get out or I shoot you. Go ahead. I don't give a fuck. - Stop that. - Get the fuck out. Ivan will finish up the rest. - What the fuck? - Hermann... What are you doing? He wanted to cop out. Get lost! That's a suicide commando. - I won't take part in this shit. - Go home then. I've had enough of this shit. Silence, men! We are fed up. Shoot us all. Doesn't matter who kills us. Silence! Listen up! The Russians are trying to push us back. Knight's Cross! Whe held our line in spite of heavy losses. They will try it again and without you we won't survive. Why is this point so important? We could break out from here in order to join forces with the troops of Colonel General Roth, they are only a few kilometers away from us. Surely you all know, that we have to get out of this pocket. I'm asking you: Do you want to die starving without putting up a fight? Do you want to be responsible for the death of 300,000 comrades? Think about it. Is it worth fighting for? A great decision. We'll get out of here. We will fight together, Captain. But if you die, we are free men. Agreed. We'll give the convicts a chance to prove themselves. You will be rehabilitated after this mission. Witzland, give me your word of honor as an officer. Jawohl. Alright. Take your ammunition and fall into two squads. Wlk, you are leading 1st squad. Mller, 2nd squad. Otto! Wait a second. We don't have a chance. Why don't you surrender? You know exactly what will happen to us. What did we do? I'm not a Nazi, Otto. No, you are worse... You Officer riff-raff. You took part in it, although you knew all along who you got involved with. I always said this. If I survive the attack, i'm going to forgive my wife. I made them announce my death to my wife. That's the best solution. But we will come back home?! Let me tell you a story. A year ago it was the last time that I was at home. Christmas holidays. Because I had knocked out three tanks. My wife and children were waiting at the train station. They were like strangers. She wanted to understand me. But the more she understood, the more I hated her. So i went, and got drunk. Whatever. I left for the front the next day. She approved of it. Only the children... I came back just in time before a major Russian offensive. That's when I was back home again. Hey, stay here. Don't go to the officers. We, the blue collar workers have to stick together. - I have Abitur (allowed to attend university). - One can't tell. Tanks! - Who has got the explosives? - Rollo. I look like my grandma. - Rollo, Explosives. - Have fun. Fire! Watch your ass. Fire! Und our artillery? You are the artillery. Get down! Let's go, quick! - Leave me alone! I want home! - Keep quiet! Heads down! Rohleder, come back! Go! Aim at the tall one. They fit. God damn. Always the right arm... Are you ok? They always hit my right side. You were lucky. Here you are, the last one. Let's share it. Thank you, Captain. Ok, let's got to the assembly area. There we'll wait for the army. The gun is coming with us. Where are the horses? We are the horses. Get out! Quick! Close the door. It's drafty. Your holidays are cancelled. We all stay here. Are you nuts? Get the fuck out, now! Now you crap your pants. Jawohl, I'm a pussy. I'm frightened. This shit makes me sick. And my pay? If i don't get my 36 marks immediately, then I will go home. - By foot. - Come on, buddy. We have to stop the Russian Army. We aren't finished yet. Vorwrts! Faster! In the name of the Fhrer. The order will be executed. - No excuses, do you understand? - Jawohl. We aren't finished yet, Lieutenant. Follow me with your men. Gentlemen. Go on! Over there! Unbelievable. One is reminded immediately where one belongs. Everybody listen up! These people are Russian Saboteurs. They are to be shot immediately. Carry out the sentence! They are shooting people since yesterday. Saboteurs my ass. They want less people who eat their food. That's the real reason. I won't do that. If you refuse they will put you in their row. At least the poor pigs are over it. I can't do that. They boy worked for us. And also for Ivan. Shut the fuck up! What the fuck is this mess? Faster! There are more people coming. Captain, I vouch for this boy. You again. You like his face? Do you also have a boy like this at home? - Child-Killer! - Shut your puss, asshole. Think about the penal-battalion. Everybody back in his place. - You are an officer. DO something. - Alright. Silence! Private first class, step forward. I will kill this pig. Leave him alone. Captain, let me speak for this man. Stand at attention while I am talking to you. Or do you want to disobey my order? At least let the child go. That's enough! There won't be a discussion. And if you shoot off mark then you can join their fate. Back into the row, private. Do you take over the command? And you are supposed to ba a descendant of an Officer's Family? Raise your Guns! Why isn't he doing anything, Fritz? We haven't shot the kid only so that you can leave us dying here. If you were a coward back then. Then at least be a man now and give the order to leave. We will find our way to the airstrip I will certainly get us a plane. It's alright, buddy. I will leave this place. I'm serious. Do you realize what you are talking about? This is desertion. What's your opinion, Lieutenant I don't believe in our oath anymore. After all that happened everybody is free to go. You are going to fuck everything up again? Not now! Won't happen again! You understand? Be wise. You are too dumb, Rohleder. Go on, kill me. It's your duty as a NCO. - Stay here! - You poor bastard, Rohleder. Fight on for the Endsieg, you are a dead man already. Who else comes with me. Greet your son from me when you come home. What about you? It's silly but I can't. I just can't A year ago I would have joined you. But now... I will accompany him. Good luck. Looks like you are going to lose the bet. Fuck. Where are we? I have no clue. I'll ask. Where is Pitomnik? Bread! Bread! Always towards west... stay in the valley The airstrip will be near. Thanks. Come. He's got a wishlist! You can read the signature on this one. "Doktor Heider". This is a medical certificate. It will bring us home. Search for more, everybody. Bandage yourself. We are now officially injured. This is for you, Hans. Silence. You aren't the only one with an injury. That's familiar, powder burns. - You have crippled yourself intentionally. - No. - Get this traitor out of here. - No, doctor. Please! I can't pull this off. They will catch us. I go back. It's too late. - Don't fuck it up. - You too. Hey, at least i'm not the only assault pioneer here. They should evacuate the specialists first. Because they will need us later. I have witnesses, doctor! You have fever, son? Can't read that. What's the name of the doctor? You can't answer that question? Doktor Heider. He is still under shock. We fought against tanks. - His buddy was torn apart. - Here, son. For your fever. You'll be home soon Look after him. Jawohl, Doctor. Go! Where is the Lieutenant? Hans, we are here! Be smart. The plane is full. Hans, over here! Bastard! Let me through! You fucking pig! Look, there come the "heroes". Fucking assholes - Where are you? - Hold on. The last German plane left Stalingrad on 23rd January 1943 Comrades! Shoot me! Welcome to the massgrave. Careful! Are you injured? He's a pussy. Only a deflection. Fucking boils. He's worse. Were there no flights anymore? No. What's up, old fellow, Look who has saved you. This will make him rage. Leave the captain alone. My foot. Fucking pain. Wait, don't do that. See, I have told you not to do it. Fine. Puke all over him. Give me a cigarette, quick. I have no luck with my right side. Alright, lets die for a little while. Go ahead. Play us a song. Fucking medals! Stand up! Stand up, already! Stand at attention! I want a report, Lieutenant. What happened to your unit? I mean, this isn't like bedlam here. Looters will be shot. Have you forgotten about that? Stop! Mller, Mller... You can't do that! It's impossible. Don't die, Mller. We'll get home. Lieutenant, arrest this man and take me away from here. My report is: the russian boy was Kolya? And this boy was Mller. Mller, like so many others. You can still make up for this. You need food. I have everything in my storage room. In the white house, behind the theatre. We'll go there. Germans don't shoot Germans. I am a German Officer. You can't leave me here! Unbelievable. These bastards. Wait, you'll get the gripes. We will do this according to our rank. You go first, Lieutenant. Drink, GG. Cadaver Rollo, Cheers. Corpse Otto. Corpse Fritz. To our great offensive. Whose turn is it? Eh, Fritz! Hearts are Trump. The spades ten has blood on the backside only that you know... Fuck. The right side. That's the life. Three are playing cards and one is fucking the wench. Am I too ugly, huh? I want to have a woman ...before i die. - Do me a favour. - Shoot me. Are you man enough? - Cut it out! I'm sure you have a wife. You love her? Yes? The love of a German Soldier grows with the distance. You will never see her again. Poor idiot. I bet you haven't even slept with her. Perhaps slavic meat is good enough after all. Here! Pale and soft, like your aryan virgin. Fuck and kill me! Here, do it yourself. I have enough of killing. - Get out! - No! Damn you. I couldn't do it either. I am a German whore. A collaborator. Rubbish. They have forced you. I should have killed me. I thought the sam. Don't interrupt the game. - Spades are trump. - Spades 10 has got blood on the backside. You know us very well. I have gotten to know you very well. My mother was German. I used to love your language. I will never forgive myself. Man, I had a fucked up dream. I couldn't piss because I was still sleeping. Fucking dream. Better then pissing, Herr Lieutenant, don't you think? Eat something and then try again later. I will teach her to be nice. Don't touch her! I'm serious. Nobody touches her. Get up, everyone! - Rohleder, come here immediately. - Jawohl, Captain. - Don't go, Rollo. - I will kill you. Stay. You won't harm your captain, would you? - Come here already. - Jawohl. I won't demand accountability. You had been good soldiers, until you tried to survive. Shut up. Stop, Reiser. Do you really believe that you can live a normal life as deserteurs? Shut the fuck up already! Don't fool yourself. You are soldiers and you will stay soldiers. War is your home. You are already dead I used to dream about being hit by a shell. The meat melts from my bones. But then i would reassemble myself again step by step. Every night. Nobody will kill me. Nobody! You have been an officer. Stop laughing! Where is the front line? I want a proper report. That is an order! Heil Hitler! Let's get the fuck out of here! I'll help you captain. Fresh air! You have lost your mind. We'll soon move on, Captain. Don't fall asleep We will soon continue. Where is the front line? What's the matter? General, Corporal Rohleder. Rehabilitated, Iron Cross 1st Class. Your MP. Give it to me. I''m a deserter. Bullshit. Get up. - Where is the front line? - come with me. Gentlemen. The frontline. Where is it? We will move on in a second. Don't sleep. I don't want to die. And you, Hans? At home, if you die as a soldier, they are proud of you. Nice, isn't it? Siberia? I pass. It's cold enough already. I will lead you out of here. I go with her. We won't make 100 meters. But it doesn't matter anyway. Alright, let's go. It's already dark, you have made it. The nice thing about the cold is... ...that you don't feel anything. Everything is frozen. It is too cold for tears. Go, Fritz. Do it. Leave! You won't get a sunburn around here. Have you seen the desert? It is an awful place. It is so hot there that you are always sweating. You melt like butter. The desert is shit. Except the stars, they are so near... You know, Hans? During the Battle of Stalingrad more than a million people died. They were either killed, froze to death or died of hunger. Russians, Romanians, Italians, Hungarians, Germans and Austrians. Out of the 260,000 Soldiers of the 6th Army 91,000 were captured. Only 6,000 men survived the captivity and returned home.
