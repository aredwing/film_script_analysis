Deliver this boy from all sin, from hatred and anger. What are you doing? From lightning and tempest, from plague and damnation, I deliver you! Begone, devil! Tremble under the powerful hand of God. Cower in the sight of His glory. You have no power over me, old man. This is sacred ground. It is you without the power. Your precious sanctuary won't save you! Leave him, unholy one. Leave with all your wickedness! Do you renounce the power of evil? Father, please have mercy. Do you renounce the power of evil? Do you renounce the power of evil? Please don't hurt me, Father. Do you renounce the power of evil? No! Saint Michael, our Archangel, defend us in this day of battle. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil. OMINOUS Michael! Do I have to stay with Sofia? It's only for a couple of hours. We won't be long, I promise. I made you something. What's this? It's you getting your award. Thank you, sweetheart. You haven't seen my brooch anywhere, have you? Michael, we're going to be late! I'm here. Didn't hear me calling you? I didn't. I'm sorry. Hey, what's this? It's a card. Jacob made it for me. I didn't get one? You're not getting an award. Touche. Have a good time. I'll keep Jacob in line while you're gone. Right, kiddo? Your fly. Will you read me a bedtime story when you get home? You mean something like "Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town? "Upstairs, downstairs, in his nightgown! -Michael. -"Tapping at the window, "Crying through the lock. "Are all the children in their beds? It's past 8 o'clock" Michael! What do you want for dinner? Ice cream. Chicken nuggets it is. What's wrong, boy? Don't worry. If we take the freeway, we should get there in time. How long has it been going on? I have no idea what you're talking about. Don't. Rachel, it's a big night. -Whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait. -We need to talk. Hon, we're gonna be late. Just answer the question. How long? Please, not now. Not tonight. My God! Jacob! He's supposed to be in the house. Call 911! I am, I am. Yes, I need an ambulance immediately to 508 Hapgood Way. My son's been hit by a car. He's seven. He's got difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, unstable vital signs. Tell Dr. Stubeck we've got a hot unload. -What have we got? -Seven-year-old male. Possible punctured lung. Get him on the table. Get me an amp of epi. He's going in to V-fib. He's unstable. We need to start compressions. Get me a cart over here! Where the hell is that epi? We're losing him. Losing pulse. Charging to 120. Clear. Get me another amp of epi. Clear. Call it. You're gonna have to say something eventually. Rachel? For crying out loud, we're coming from our son's funeral. Please. Fine. Michael! What the hell is the matter with you? It just came out of nowhere. Right! You know what? -Why don't you just say it? -Say what? That you blame me for Jacob. Do you? It was an accident, Rachel. Were you drinking? Is that what you think? I had one drink that night while I was getting ready. One. It's never just one. No, I wasn't drunk, Rachel! -Yeah, right. -Come on! It's in pain. Well, call a vet. Michael, you can't. We can't just leave it here. Stay here. I'll be right back. Can I help you? Actually, I was hoping I could help you. It's been a really bad day. What's he want? Would you like to have your son back? What did he say? I asked you if... Yeah. I heard what you said. Now I'm asking you to leave. All I'm asking is that you promise to protect the boy. Protect him from what? Did you hear me? Small price to pay, isn't it? For the life of your son? -Okay, that's it. -Michael. Bring the body back here. I'll take care of everything else. Good day to you. I can't believe you're even thinking about it. It came back to life, Michael. Yes. But digging up our son's body? Handing it over to some stranger? It's insane. Yeah, it is. Thank you. What have we got to lose? Listen to yourself! Are you honestly willing to go out there right now and dig up Jacob's grave? Because I know I'm not. Get down, get down. It's clear. Come on. It's gonna be okay, boy. What have we done? Everything we could. Thanks. For trying. Wait downstairs. Bad dream? Yeah. Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy. What is it, Mommy? What's wrong? Nothing. Just so glad to see you. It's really him. Of course it is. It's our son. What's wrong, boy? Bruce? Bruce! I've had my demons. I drank, I cheated on my wife. But... Three months ago, I got a second chance. We moved to a new town, a new house. And you know what? We're better. I'm not drinking anymore. My wife and I are closer than ever. And my son... I feel like I got my family back. You pretending to be asleep? Nope. You want to fool around before he wakes up? Yep. Good morning. Hello to me. -Michael. -What? -Michael. -What? -He's here. -Who? Look. Hey. How long you been standing there, buddy? I'm hungry. Can you make pancakes? Sure. Be right there. Look at him. He's like a perfect little angel. You know, this is what I thought it would be like when we were first married. Me, too. Have we unpacked the spatula yet? Let me look. You know, I was thinking. We should go to church tomorrow. Church? Yeah, why not? Got a new name, new house, new car. New beginnings. Sounds perfect. Me like mine with blueberries. So demanding. -Tell Jacob breakfast is almost ready. -Okay. Jacob! Mom says breakfast is almost ready. Jacob? You out here? Jacob! Boo! Gotcha. Come on, it's time to get in the house for breakfast. Okay. "Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town "Upstairs, downstairs, in his nightgown "Tapping at the window Crying through the lock "Are all the kids in their beds? It's past 8 o'clock" I know I'm not like other kids. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do. I feel different sometimes. You make me feel better. You always were a good mother, Rachel. Sorry, were you talking to me? Is something wrong, Daddy? Who were you talking to? Myself. I saw someone in here with you. There's no one here. Michael? There was someone here. I swear I saw something. Hasn't he been through enough? I'm not making this up. What's going on with you, Michael? Let's talk about this. There's nothing to talk about. There. They're gone now. So, where were we? The devil, Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub. Often symbolic of man's fall from grace. The Bible calls him by many names. How can one not realize that not only is the devil real, but he is thriving? Strife in the Middle East, disease in Africa, families being washed away by floods. His influence can be felt everywhere, constantly tempting all of humanity to betray one another to commit sin. As Jesus said in 1 John, chapter 3. "Let no one be led astray. "The one who sins is of the devil. "That is how we know who the children of God are "and who are the children of the devil." Jacob? Jacob, are you okay? Michael, what's wrong? You're the doctor. "Anyone... "Anyone who does not... "Any... Anyone who does not know what right is... -Is it a seizure? -I don't know. You have... You have to rid yourself of the devil! "Anyone who does not know what is right... Jacob! "...is not God's child!" We need to get him out of here! Go. What's wrong with him? I have no idea. Put me down! -Get the car. Get the door. -Let go of me! Stop it! Jacob! Let me see. Michael! It's fine. Let's just go. Father, are you okay? Are you hurt? What was that? That was a warning. Hey, it's not your fault. You tried to save him. You were the only one. Look, I know you've been trying really hard. You have us. Isn't that what really matters? I'll be fine. Hey! Why were you watching me? Please take a seat, Mr. Young. How'd you know that name? I know a lot of things about you, your wife, your son. You're probably thinking you made a mistake, right? Are you a man of faith, Michael? Occasionally. Well, when you've seen the things I have, you realize that a crucifix is just two pieces of crossed wood. Holy water, regular H2O. The real power is in the devil. What if I told you he could be reborn? If the right opportunity presented itself. Like a recently deceased young boy? Two loving, desperate parents willing to do anything to get their son back? Are you suggesting the devil is responsible for bringing my son back? I'm suggesting that the son you got back is the devil. This is a mistake. I shouldn't have come here. So a complete stranger pops out of nowhere and offers to bring your son back from the dead? Come on. You don't find that a little odd? You don't see the catch? You think what happened at the church this morning was an accident? You think Jacob had something to do with that? As long as that boy lives... What do you mean "lives"? Not you, not your wife, not anyone you care or love will be safe. This is my son we're talking about. It is not your son! What's this? He was barely 10-years-old the day he chased his ball into the middle of the street. I ran after him, but it was too late. He was hit by a van. He died instantly. The next day, a man came to visit his mother and I. This is your son? He offered us a chance to... To bring Jeremy back. But it didn't take long for me to realize that it wasn't Jeremy. It was something else. He'd become something. I don't know. I got lost. I was struggling for an answer. I was scared. So I joined the church. And the Lord... The Lord showed me what had to be done. You did this? -I did what I had to do. -You killed your son. No, I killed the devil who looked like my son. Jacob has to be stopped at all costs, Mr. Young. And only the boy's father can do it. Only you can stop Jacob before it's too late. You are out of your mind! I understand what you're going through. It'll only get worse, I promise you. If Jacob matures, God help us all. For your coffee. Jacob? Jacob? Jacob? "Tapping at the window And crying through the lock "Are all the children in their beds? "It's past 8 o'clock" I... I have to go. I'm sorry. What the hell, man? Hey! What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Say hi to Mom. Say hello. -Hi, Mommy! -Hi. Go on, go on. Good! What are you doing out here? I was... I was just on my phone. Can we have pizza for dinner? Sure, yeah. I can't believe he did that. What did he say? He just wanted to make sure Jacob was okay. And what did you tell him? I don't know. I... I mean, last night in the room, and then the church. You have to admit, he hasn't been the same since he came back. I can hardly blame him after everything he's been through. I knew things would be different for a while, but these last couple days... Maybe we should take Jacob to a specialist. -You mean a shrink? -No, I mean someone to talk to. Someone who can tell us if there's, you know, something wrong. What happens when the specialist figures out who he is? Fifty people at his funeral. We had to leave everything -and everyone behind. -I know. We have a new life, a new home. Can't just keep running. We promised to protect him. I know. I thought you were doing better. I thought the meetings were helping. What does that have to do with anything? You know exactly what I'm talking about. You weren't exactly there for him. Or me. We were having trouble. Our marriage was falling apart. And we're better now. I'm better now. But what's happening with Jacob, this is something else. Jacob, honey? How long have you been standing there? Daddy? Why did you kill me? Don't. How's he doing this morning? Better. We're going to the park later. You want to come? I think I'm gonna hit up a couple temp agencies. -Mind if I take the car? -No. I could use the fresh air. Go get 'em. I will. Bye, Jacob. How come Daddy didn't come? He had an interview. Is he getting a job? I certainly hope so. Can we get a cat? No, honey. How come? Your father's allergic. You know that. Can we get one when Daddy dies? Mrs. Field. You go ahead and play. Mommy will be right there. -Okay. -I'll hold that. How'd you find us? Don't be alarmed. I just wanted to see how things were coming along. What a fine, young, handsome boy. So innocent. Pure. My husband's concerned about him. Thinks we should take him to see a specialist. What do you think? He's a seven-year-old boy. Moved to a new home, a strange new town. I'd be alarmed if he wasn't feeling a little awkward. Well, Jacob's an extraordinary child. As with many extraordinary children, you'll find that some people take an unusual interest in them. You mean hurt him? You have to remember, Rachel, Jacob is a miracle. He needs your love and devotion if he's to live a normal life. Promise me you'll continue to protect him. -Of course. -At all costs. Even from those who are close to him. I promise. I'm gonna give you an address. If things become difficult, you and Jacob will always be welcome. Jacob? Jacob? Jacob? -Hey, what do you think you're doing? -I was waiting. Why don't you go back to where you came from? -Yeah, we don't want you here. -Get lost. Leave me alone. That's right, go home to Mommy and cry. What's going on? Is he doing that? You've got to be kidding me. What the hell is going on out there? We were just kidding. We didn't mean it. -I think we better get out of here. -Let's go. Can anybody hear me? Hello? Please! Somebody, help me! Open! Please! Somebody, help me! Go, go, go. Run home. Jacob? Jacob? Here, Mommy. Jacob. Hey. I just heard about what happened. -Are you okay? -Yeah, we're just a bit shaken up. They said a number of people were brought in to the emergency room, but nobody seems to know what caused it. Well, the news is calling it some kind of freak weather thing. We got lucky. I'm just glad you both are okay. Hey, what do you say we get some pizza on the way home. -Would you like that? -Sure. Come on. Jacob. Time for bed. Make sure he brushes his teeth, too. You hear that? Mommy says it's time to brush your teeth. Jacob? Jacob? Are you here? What is it? Have you seen Jacob? Not since earlier. I thought he was in here. My God. Jacob. -Jacob? -Jacob? He couldn't have gotten far. Come on. Hello? Such a shame about Jeremy. I don't think I got a chance to offer my condolences. Tell me, Father... What was it like to bring that blade down on your own son's neck? He wasn't my son. Father, you're losing your touch. Such a pity. I'm not gonna let you do what you did to my son and I, to anyone else. -I gave him a little life. -You turned him into a monster. Well, one man's monster is another man's God. Yeah, but my God will win. AND THE DEVIL WHO HAD DECEIVED THEM... WAS THROWN INTO THE LAKE... OF FIRE AND SULFUR... WHERE THE BEAS AND FALSE PROPHET WERE... AND WHERE THEY WILL BE TORMENTED... DAY! AND NIGHT! FOREVER! Good-bye, Vetus Amicus. So filled with anger, consumed with vengeance you could smell, but you couldn't taste. Tell me, old friend. Where's your God now? So much suffering. What kind of a God would let his child endure it? Did your son cry out for mercy before you cut his head off? Perhaps he's watching now. I wonder whose side he's on. Jacob. Jacob? Jacob? Jacob? Jacob? Come on. He's getting stronger, isn't he? He's the one. I feel it. Jacob? Jacob? -Daddy? -My God. Mommy? I'm ready to come home now. I think we'd better go. Now, you can't just run off like that. You understand that, don't you? Jacob? I understand, Mommy. Michael? Michael? There's something I need to do. "The Discipuli is a secret society of wealthy noblemen "dating back to 17th-century Rome. "They dedicated their lives to manipulating bloodlines "in order to give birth to a true Antichrist, "Satan himself reborn in human form. "The Discipuli believed "that the birth and rise of Satan "would usher in a new age, "in which they could achieve limitless power and wealth." My God. Father Francis? Yeah, he was in room 156. Hey, what are you doing here? Officer? Officers? Officer, you need to talk to this guy. "After initial efforts failed, the Discipuli realized "that their young subjects must be offered willingly "by their parents as sacrifices." "The children would become a vessel for the Antichrist "until reaching maturity, "at which point their real potential, "the devil within, will awaken." -What are you doing? -You scared me. I scared you? -What the hell is going on, Michael? -Nothing. Is this about what the priest told you? -Where were you tonight? -It doesn't matter. Look, I've been thinking. We should leave. -What? -Everything that's happened tonight... This week... We should leave town for a while. -For Jacob. -For... for Jacob? And where would you like to go, exactly? Here. -What's this? -It's an address. The Stranger gave it to me. The Stranger? When? At the park, he said we'd be safe there. What do you mean, safe? We promised to protect Jacob. You remember? Yeah. You remember what he said? We can't allow anything to happen to him at any cost. And he's our son. Right. So what's the problem? You're probably right. Why don't you put a bag together, and I'll finish up here, okay? -Really? -Yeah. Okay. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Why don't you go in and get some snacks for the road while I fill up? Good idea. I'll be right back. We'll be here. Quiet tonight? Thanks. Have a good one. I'm sorry. What happened? My God, we have to save him. -No, no, no. Don't. -Get off of me! -Rachel. -Help me. There's a child in the car! He's your son! No, he's not! Jacob! It can't be. -Rachel. Rachel, no. -Jacob. How could you do this? Rachel. Rachel, Rachel, please. Have you found my wife and son? We'll get to that, Mr. Field. No, you don't understand. You have to find them. You know how many murders we had in this town last year? Go on, go ahead, guess. -We're wasting time. -None. You know how many we had the year before that? None? Smarter than you look, Mr. Field. Do you know this man? No. That's funny, 'cause I got three witnesses that put you in his hotel room hours after the time of his death. We'll get back to him. How about this man? It's that... That priest from the church. Now, the witnesses say you were the only one that went up there and tried to help him. In fact, you were the one that actually put out the flames. Is that true? Yes. Okay, well, here's my problem. I haven't had a murder in this town in two years. Now I got two dead priests, and the only connection between them both is you. Are you sure you don't know this man? Father Francis and I met up at a restaurant a couple days ago. I was having family issues. He said he wanted to help. Now, if you could just help me find my wife and son. Wait. What's going on? What are you doing? What's going on? Too many eyes and ears. Here's the truth. I've been following Father Francis for a while now, ever since he fled the city after murdering his son. That's not exactly what happened. I know about the Discipuli cult. I know that Father Francis was following them. Children rising from the grave, death and destruction following them wherever they go. Six victims succumbed to their injuries just this afternoon. If you knew it was happening... Why didn't you do something about it? I told you, lots of eyes and ears. We're talking about a secret society here. It's been around for hundreds of years. That's a hell of a lot of influence. What I need is an active case. You're talking about Jacob. Do you happen to know where they went? They gave my wife an address. Can you write that down, please? No, I don't need to. I'm going. You're the prime suspect in an attempted murder case. -You're not going anywhere. -I don't care. You can cuff me, shackle me, do what you want. But I'm going with you. Hello? Is there anybody here? Welcome. I'm glad to see you. What is this place? Someplace safe. Do come. Please, make yourselves at home. After all, it's been put here for you. Quite the collection. Reminders of a rich and storied history. You know, we've been waiting for this a long time. I want you to know how dedicated we all are to seeing you reach your full potential. What potential is that? Don't be concerned, Rachel. You and your son will be safe here. Is he my son? Even if he weren't, would he be less deserving of your love, nurture, care? Every boy deserves a mother. Your husband's arrived, and he's brought some friends. I'm gonna need you to stay here. You can't leave me. If your wife and son are here, we'll find 'em. You... you don't understand. It's being handled. No. Hey! Hey! Jacob. There's a threat. We need to move to the next step. Can you do it? Good boy. It's police. We have a warrant to search the premises. Open up. Jacob. Jacob? What's he doing? What's going on? What's happening? What's he doing? Doing what needs to be done. You have to stop him. We can't let them hurt the boy. But he's killing them. Jacob? Larson. Get me out of here! Let me out! Open the door! Open the door. Please, move! Here, here. Come on. Okay, Mr. Young. -What now? -Now? We find my son. Come on. Come on. We're all clear. What? Thought I saw something. He's toying with us. Might be the Antichrist, but he's still a child. I think it's time we give that son of a bitch a time-out. Yeah, come on. He's got to be up here. Come on. Jacob? Rachel? I know you're in here. Show yourself. Hide-and-seek? Great. Let's play, Daddy. Okay. My friend, he'd like to play, too. Is that okay? Sure. What are we gonna play? How about we play... Dead. Jacob, stop. You stop that this instant, you understand? It's your choice. Look out. You know what needs to be done. He's the only one standing in your way. Please, don't hurt him. I know you're not my son. But I also know there's still part of him in there somewhere. I'm sorry... For everything I've done to you and your mother. I'm so, so sorry. But you don't have to do this. We can end this nightmare right now. All you have to do is come with us. Please. You're lying. Please. Finish him. Honey. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be... We've got to go. We've got to get out of here. Come on. Run. Come on. Okay, baby, gonna get you to a hospital. Okay. Faster. Go faster. I'm trying. Get off the road now. -Just get to the house. -Okay. -What are they waiting for? -I don't know. -Come on. -Wait. Upstairs, now. Now. Mommy? Daddy? I'm home. Where are you, Father? You think you can defeat me? You think you have power over me? I'm the Father now. I am the Father, the Son. I am the unholy trinity. You should know, Daddy, this is all your fault. Are you okay? It has to be me. Wh... What you mean? I have to do it. It has to be me. Go to hell. Try to take it easy for a couple of days, okay? Keep off your feet, if possible. And... I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you, Doctor. It's never easy, is it? So young. So vulnerable. You have my condolences. However... What if I told you I could bring him back?
