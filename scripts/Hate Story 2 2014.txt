Mr. Dsousa, do not go out of Goa forthe next few days... ...without informing us. Okay. Come. Sir, this is Dr. Menon. He's handling the female's case. Hello, Doctor. - Hello. Vargese. lnsp. Vargese. Dr. Menon. - Okay. What do you think, doctor? How soon can she regain consciousness? lt's hard to say. She was brought here in a very bad shape. Looking at her condition... ...we can imagine that she struggled really hard. She's out of it now. But only after a CT Scan can we say... ...how successful her struggle was. Did you find anything in her clothes? Some lD... Any kind of identification? No. And l feel you'll have to wait for a long time... ...to take her statement. ln such cases and conditions and formal cases the patients... Okay, doctor. - Excuse me! Stay alert. Whoever did this can strike again. lnform me first when she regains consciousness. Okay? l should be the first one. - Sure, sir. Alright, see you. Sir...that girl's still alive. Gaekwad, how long are you going to stand here? Go get a cup of tea. l'll stay here. - Yes. And yes. Get me a nice cup of tea too. - Yes, sir. Oh, my god! Ma'am... Ma'am...are you okay? What happened? Ma'am... You're in a hospital. No need to be scared. Just relax! l'll call the doctor, okay? Relax! ls everything okay, nurse? She's conscious, but seems disoriented. Please inform your superior officer. - Sure. And file a case against both of them. - Okay sir. Sir! Gaekwad! Where's the girl? Sir, l was sitting right here. Where's the girl? - She was right here. Dr. Menon examined her a while ago. And sir, l gave her sedatives myself and tucked her in. So did she sleepwalk out of here? Were you two awake or sleeping? Gaekwad, lock this hospital down. No one gets in and no one gets out. - Yes, sir. Alvin, relay to the headquarters... ...l want more backup, right now. Where's the Dean of this hospital? Sir, ground floor. Did you see a girl here? - No, sir. Do one thing, check the room at the back. And D'souza, go down and check at the reception. lf you find any information then tell sir about it. - Yes, sir. Nurse. - Yes, sir. Myself, insp. Anton. Afemale patient's missing from the 2nd floorward. Did you see anyone heading this way... ...who didn't belong here? l saw no one, sir. - Okay. Sir, the doctorwants to speak to you urgently. Yes, doctor. - We've received the patient's CT scan reports. She has a serious problem. She has partial cerebral hypoxic ischemia. Meaning. Well, she didn't get oxygen for a long time in the coffin... ...which means her brain didn't get oxygen for a long time. That's why she has suffered some brain damage. This brain damage will affect her coordination... ...between the brain and muscles. She'll suffer seizures. She can also have hallucinations. We call it delusion. lt needs to be cured. lf she stays alone, she can also die. Don't worry, we will find her, doctor. - Okay. Gaekwad, l want updates every10 minutes. - Yes sir. Father used to say, love of the people... ...and Mandar in the elections... ...both are meant forwinning. l've witnessed your love in today's rally. And soon we'll witness the enemy's defeat. Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! ln this political ocean you'll come across many... ...ready to reap the rewards. But a true devotee of Shiva... ...is someone who's ready to swallow poison just like Him. Mandar is a devotee of Lord Shiva. And so he promises that, if needed... ...on the holy occasion if 'Shiv Ratri'... ...he'll put his life at stake for his brothers. lt's forthe protection of righteousness. So your protection is my duty and my deed. Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... Mandar! - Move back! Glory to... - Mandar! Glory to... - Mandar! Come, dear. - Come. You two go home. l'lljoin you later. Aren't you coming along? Along with 'Shiv Ratri', it's also Anu's birthday. You want me to blow up balloons... ...and light birthday candles... ...instead of preparing forthe elections. Stop this charade and go home. Have you seen today's paper? lf 18 is the legal age to vote... ...then why is the legal age to booze 25? How long with the youth be toyed around? How long with their sensibility and values be questioned? That's Atul's new move. To draw the youth's attention towards him. Yes, uncle. When the sea's churned... ...the demons will also get hold of something. But you thought that demon politics. lt's really sad that he's your uncle's son. Hello. The horse moves 21/2 paces. From E3 to F5. Make your move. l...l...l can't think of anything right now. l don't have much time. Make your move. l am actually...getting late for my photography class. l have just 40 seconds. Speak up. lf you move the horse, the tower... No, no, l mean the queen... l am really sorry, l can't rememberthe chessboard. My mind's in the photography class. Real photos aren't taken from the camera. Real photos are those which get embedded in the mind. lf you want to do anything life... ...then forget the camera, adjust the focus of your life. To hell with your... l'll come by 5pm, be at home. Sir, why don't we flash her photo on television... ...and make an announcement? We aren't the only ones looking for her, Gaikwad. There's someone she's trying to escape from. lf we make an announcement... ...it will alert those people. Okay. Quietly keep a watch on everyone. lf you suspect anyone, bring him to me. Okay. - Sir. One more thing. Find out where's the control room forthis CCTV. Okay. - Okay, sir. l had told you, don't open these boxes. Don't open these boxes as long as madam doesn't return. Now she'll ask who opened the packed boxes. l didn't touch these boxes. lf it wasn't you, then was it a ghost? l don't know. She just stepped out of the storeroom... ...and she's wearing a doctor's scrub. Keep an eye on everyone. lnform your men. Hey, stop that bus. What happened, sir? l want the number of that van's driver. Now! Yes, who is it? lnsp. Anton speaking. Park your vehicle on the side and listen to me carefully. Yes, sir. l am doing just that. Hold on. Yes, sir. Go ahead. There's a female in your vehicle... ...wearing a doctor's scrub. Yes, sir. l will check it. No, sir. No female here is wearing a doctor's scrub. She is jumped of the bus. Excuse me. Can...can you please help me? - Yes. Actually l've to get to Panjim. l missed my bus due to an emergency case. l need help. You're a doctor? - Yes, yes. Actually l didn't get time to change... ...in a hurry to catch the staff bus. Well, come right in. Thank you. Well, it's your lucky day. Because l am heading that way. Actually, l was on duty in the operation theatre, so... So in a hurry to catch your bus... ...you forgot to wear your slippers. Right? - Right. lt happens. Who are we waiting for? The enemy who can't be a friend. Father used to say... ...a women her place, and a enemy his stature... ...should be shown soon. Uncle? - They are here. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Please, leave me. Sir... - He's Bajirao. Sir... - He's the one refusing to sell the shanty. Sir, sir, it was a big mistake. But what to do? That shanty is my home. lt's a refuge for my wife and kids. Sir...sir... l made a big mistake. l am ready to do as you say, sir. l made a mistake. Like you say. Tick...tick...tick...tick. Sir...sir... What does Amitabh Bachchan say... ...on ''Kaun Banega Crorepati''. ''Suyi Muyiji, calm down.'' You should've given your answer... ...when l sent the money. Now you've run out of lifeline. l couldn't open this bottle of cough syrup... ...so l was trying to... Sonica, l love you. l know you don't love me. lt doesn't make a difference to me. Because my love doesn't need your approval. l will always look after you. And even your...grandma... ...in the old age home. Just don't try to separate yourself from me. ln no way. lf you part ways, l'll be really hurt. And if l am hurt, then your grandma will get hurt. Get it? lt's almost dawn, l am going home. Take care. Have you seen this girl? No, sir! - Stop! Anybody after you? No, no one. - let's go. Have you seen this girl? Yes, l have. Hi. - Hi. lnspector Anton Vargese. Where did you see this girl? l gave her a lift a while ago. Where did you drop her? She was saying Gabriele Road. Sir. The neighbors say this is the only house... ...that's been locked for many years. So maybe... - No, this is the one. Let's go. lt's still wet. lt's been used just now. Search the place now. - Yes, sir. Now! - Okay, sir! Sir, l searched the entire house. She isn't here. She isn't afraid to die. She's avoiding the police. Sir, l don't understand one thing. Why are we following her? She hasn't committed any crime. Let her die if she wants to. What do we care? The police's job isn't just stopping crime... ...it's also protecting the people. Show her photo to all the neighbors, okay. lf you suspect anyone, search their home. Call the forensics' team. And stay here until they don't get here. Alright? - Yes. So you see. A direct flash on the subject... ...makes the subject flat. And it creates a lot of unnecessary shadow. You understand, Akshay? Yes...yes, sir, l get it. Basically, bounce light off other object... ...to make beautiful subject for my next project. Right, funny boy. That will do. This week's assignment will be on perspective. l've divided all of you in a pair of twos forthis week. We'll see how two people... ...view the same sight differently. So...that will be Ankita and Ashu. Gauri and Shreyas. Rahul and Ranvir. Tulica and Vedica. Sonica and Akshay. Everybody ready? Go ahead and click Mumbai. You aren't taking photographs. Not intrested? Why? ls everything okay? l broke up with my girlfriend. Oh... ...sorry to hearthat. But what happened? That's exactly what l don't understand. Her dog died. l only sent a cute message. Baby, your dog's dead. l don't know what to do. LOL! And afterthat she stopped talking to me. l mean...silly girl. You said LOL? - Yes. You're laughing. - Sorry. l am really sorry, l know l shouldn't be laughing. But who says LOL? LOL... LOL means lots of love. ldiot, LOL means Laugh Out Loud. Oh s That means... No wonder she's thinking that... - Yeah, right. Exactly. Now call her up and apologies. Thanks. You're lying, aren't you? Right. But at least you LOL. ''Sometimes l wrote your name on the mirror.''

Exactly... l know. l know you went to meet some boy. l'm sparing you because l don't have evidence. But if l find out that my suspicion is right... ...then next time you'll out of breath for good.

How can she come out of the grave? l cannot forget her voice so soon, uncle. She didn't just get out of the grave... ...but also killed Goli. Now? Now... Nothing. Meaning? - l mean we do nothing. She'll make her next move. She's planning to kill us...and we wait for her. That's nice. To kill a rat we don't run after it, uncle. The rat automatically gets trapped in the trap... ...to suffice it's hunger. She'll come. She will surely come to us...to die again. Keep an eye... - Okay, sir. Okay. - Yes. Hello. l really troubled you a lot... ...by disappearing from the hospital, inspector. l am really sorry. Where are you? Forget about me and listen carefully. Another murderwas committed the night l was attacked. Akshay Bedi. There's no FlR in your records. But l know officers like you... ...only need information, not FlR. What do you want to say? Akshay's dead body is still in the car. And the car's...in Ambolin lake. Sir, there are two bags in the car. One contained male and female clothes. And we found this from the other. ''13th Jun, 2010.'' ''He didn't allow me to attend photography class again.'' ''Coming to him was once my need.'' ''But now l am lost in front of his needs.'' ''Everything belongs to him.'' ''The house, the furniture, the curtains, bedroom.'' ''And me?'' ''l'm a body adorned in this prison called home.'' ''He's appointed another bodyguard today...'' ''...to keep an eye on him.'' ''So that l can't go anywhere.'' ''lf l had even tried, he would've killed me.'' ''He's neither letting me live nor die.'' ''He controls everything.'' ''My body, my mind, my spirit.' ''He rules Mumbai.'' ''l've no way to escape him.'' ''The entire city's scared of him.'' ''Where can l go?'' ''l've no one in this world except for my grandma.'' ''Mandar Mhatre is a dangerous man.'' ''No one can stop him.'' ''l am doomed.'' ''Forthe first time l can see a ray of light.'' ''ln the form of Akshay.'' ''He gave me a collage today.'' ''He loves me.'' ''And maybe, for a moment l've put everything behind me...'' ''...and fallen for him.'' ''We've decided to elope.'' ''We'll go to Goa forever.'' ''Far away from Mandar Mhatre's world.'' ''We'll settle our own small world.'' ''Our own.'' ''l am finally free of Mandar Mhatre.'' ''lt feels my lifetime imprisonment...'' ''...has finally ended.'' ''l am so happy.'' You want me to go to Mandar Mhatre's house... ...on the basis of these papers, and arrest him? Do you have any idea who Mandar Mhatre is? Along with his arrest warrant... ...my death warrant will be issued as well. And if l manage to escape alive... ...then people will kill me on the streets. Sorry, sir. But l've always had his respects for Mumbai Police. l know you'll face few difficulties solving this case. But l also know that you won't step back from your duty. As far as evidence is concerned... ...it's not just this diary... ...we also found Akshay Bedi's dead body. l did make a mistake. l wanted to kill both of them. But the girl escaped. l did make a mistake. But l don't understand how she escaped? She didn't just escape, Mhatre sir... ...in fact, she's taking absurd measures... ...to implicate you. She's the one who called the inspector in Goa... ...and told him about Akshay's dead body. Can the dead body testify? No. ls the girl here to testify? No. So what's the problem? That inspector's the problem. He's very smart. He has the girl's handwritten diary. And l am quite sure... ...he must have made some report regarding the dead body. Will Mandar Mhatre have to teach you... ...how one officertackles another? That's fine, but... - Look, Kishore. Just tell me one thing. Are you here to help or add to my problems? What are you saying, Mhatre sir? Don't worry at all. l'll handle everything. l've learnt some politics in your company. ln today's breaking news, l would like to tell you... ...about innocent and na.i.ve looking... ...Mumbai resident, Sonica Prasad. Yes, Sonica Prasad trapped... ...Akshay Bedi in herfake love. She went to Goa with him and murdered him. Akshay Bedi came to Mumbai... ...to pursue a career in Fashion photographer. And they met at Professor Bajaj's Academy. Uncle, isn't she the same girl? Your niece, Sonica Prasad. The one l met at the book launch. She isn't my real niece. Everyone calls me uncle. So l call them niece or nephew. Gushed out of Hardwaar and locked horns with Mandar. Locked horns with Mandar. Locked horns with Mandar. Poorthing washed all my sins... ...and got tainted herself. Mandar. Sonica's grandma is here. Along with few ward boys from the old age home. Uncle, now we have a piece of cheese to catch the rat. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Sir...- Why did you take the trouble? You could've sent a word, l would've come. Sit, sit. You could've called, l would've come. Save my Soni, sir. Soni can never do such a thing. He can never do this. The police are definitely mistaken. When my son and daughter-in-law died in an accident... ...you supported her. You're her guardian. l trust you completely... ...that you will save Soni somehow. l tried explaining her. Don't mingle with this useless boy. But no, she eloped with him. - Come. Forgive her, sir. What are you doing? You're elderto me. This way you'll make me a sinner. Come on, let's forget what happened. Bring herto him. Try to explain her... ...that if she stays underground... ...the police will be against her. Once she's here, l'll get her out of this mess somehow. Come, Grandma. Before she left she gave me a phone number. You see...she'll be scared to see all of you. - l see. You stay here. - Yes. l'll bring her out. - You go get her. l'll be right back. Sonika. - Grandma... How are you, my child? What has happened? What is everyone saying about you. Grandma, sit down. Let me explain you everything. What will you explain your grandma? Come. Come with me to Mandar. He will handle everything. l have talked to him. Come on... - No, grandma. He will never understand. What do you think? Didn't l think about it? Come on. Come on, dear. You guys locked Akshay in the car... ...and threw him in the lake. He couldn't breathe without oxygen. He suffocated. l don't have a lake. But l'll suffocate you as well. Come. You... Go out. - Yes, sir! lt's her. She's done it. Election's around the corner. The media shouldn't get a whiff of this. Close the file. ls it genuine? - 1000/0. l got it directly from the Police Station. Okay. Thank you. l read it. Look, l'm really very sorry. l did a story on you considering... ...you were Akshay Bedi's murderer. But think about it once again. lf l do this story, then we're the press... ...no one can harm us. But you'll need protection. Mandar Mhatre will need protection, not me. l am ready to die. Not him. We've learned from trusted sources... ...that Sonica is trying to escape... ...from Mandar Mhatre, a politician from Vishwa Mahasang... ...and not the police. We've got our hands on certain evidence... ...which proves that Mandar Mhatre... ...forcefully made Sonica his mistress for 3 years. Sonica's handwritten diary proves... ...that she loved Akshay Bedi... ...and was planning to elope with him. We'd like to show you some photographs... ...which Sonica Prasad took in her home... ...in the last 3 years. Let me remind you, that Goa Police... ...has found Akshay Bedi's dead body. And considering all the evidences... ...it'll be wrong to say that only Sonica Prasad... ...is behind Akshay's murder. Mandar... - Move! How did they get the diary? How did they get the diary? Move. Mandar... When? When did she write a diary? Where did this diary come from? Must be the press. Tell them no comments. No comments. l don't want to talk to anyone. Who is it? What? Yes. Yes. He's right here. Call from Delhi. Call from Delhi. What? What do l say? Yes, ma'am. No... lt's just a ruse of the opposition. And photos can be edited on a computerthese days. Yes...yes, ma'am... l'll handle everything... Yes... No problem. Yes...ma'am. Hello. Mandar Mhatre's political rival... ...and cousin, Atul Mhatre wants to meet you. When do we meet? Sorry, sorry, Sonica. This is more of a filmy smugglertype meeting, but... You can't meet me publicly. Correct. You're smart. So...why did you want to meet me? Your sorrows have made me really sad, Sonica. No need for an election speech. Talk clearly. Listen, Sonica. Mandar's wronged you and me too. You want revenge... ...and l want to defeat him in the next election. Our motives are connected. l know the police are looking for you. But...l want to organize a big private press conference... ...where all the reporters from... ...all the big channels will be present. Yourwhereabouts, the interview's location... ...will remain confidential. All l want... l just want you to come before the media... ...and shatter Mandar's image. Just add spice to everything that reporter said with yourtears. l'll handle the rest. That's only about your interest. Sonica, just start helping me first, and then... ...as soon as l win the elections, l will... Again the election speech. l get it. Name your price. You'll have the entire money in advance before the sun sets. l do want an advance, Mr. Atul. But it's not money. l see. Then what is it? Kaka Bhonsle. Alive. Kaka...Bhonsle. Hello. l will be there. Welcome...Sonica. l guess we'll always be meeting secretly. Kaka? - l kept my promise. Come. Father used to say... Aweakling's intent, and politician's promise... ...are meant to break. You must have heard that saying. Birds of a feather...flock together. ln this case, politicians of a feather...flock together. How are you, Atul? Your blessings, brother. Sonica, l am so sorry. Brother made me an offer l couldn't refuse. We're sharing seat in the election. End of all conflicts. Now that we brothers are together... ...l don't need uncle. But you shouldn't have killed him. See...you forcefully barged in his farmhouse. And gravely injured the watchman and his bodyguard. Get up. Uncle and you had quite a scuffle. Uncle hurled you onto this table. You got up and hurled uncle on the dining table. Like this. Then...somehow you got hold of the gun... ...and you shot uncle. Don't worry, it's empty now. She killed uncle, but she was so gravely injured... ...that she couldn't escape. Poor soul seeking retribution... ...was on the verge of dying. Check and mate. ''My heart keeps asking me...'' ''...why do l love you so much?'' ''Why are your desires...'' ''...more important than every wish.'' ''l keep uttering only your name.'' ''Why am l obsessed to be your companion?'' ''Why do l want to drink yourtears...'' ''...and comfort you?'' ''l want to love you every day, wait for you.'' ''l want to keep you safe in my arms.'' Get up. Get up, girl. What are you staring at? Get up. Get up. Get up you ham! Here, sign it. What is it? lt states that you killed Goli, Babu and Kaka Bhonsle. You tried to implicate Mandar Mhatre... ...on the basis of fake diary and photographs. lt's your statement, sign it. Sign it. lt will save you the trouble. Let her lie there. Hunger and thirst will set her straight. ''l keep mentioning about you all the time.'' ''That's the effect you've had on me.'' ''l want no advice.'' ''Because my soul's chosen you.'' ''Why am l obsessed to be your companion?'' ''Why do l want to drink yourtears...'' ''...and comfort you?'' ''l want to love you every day, wait for you.'' ''l want to keep you safe in my arms.'' ''The heart's worried for no reason.'' ''Someone try to explain it.'' ''Destroyed in love, that's the tradition.'' ''The one that's patient, is not love.'' ''Try to understand my heart...'' ''...what's this all about.'' ''Why am l obsessed to be your companion?'' ''Why do l want to drink yourtears...'' ''...and comfort you?'' ''l want to love you every day, wait for you.'' ''l want to keep you safe in my arms.'' We would've pounded her until she agreed. lf you think she will listen to you, then you can try. One of the people that you killed was my officer. Your officertried to kill me in the hospital. And the other three killed Akshay. My only regret is that... ...their boss Mandar Mhatre's alive. l know you want to avenge Akshay's death. But that's not your job, but the law's. The same law which the ACP and Mandartoys around with. That's not true. Trust me. Fine. l trust you. l'll sign on this statement. But just promise me one thing. You will arrest Mandar Mhatre. Tell me...can you arrest Mandar Mhatre? Will your law punish Mandar Mhatre... ...for Akshay's murder and attempt to murder me. Come on. Come on. Move l say. Lower your guns or l'll blow his brains out. Put down your guns l said. Nobody will shoot. Lower your guns. Come on. Open the door. Where's your jeep? Where's your jeep? Get your car. Stop. Give me the car keys. l said give me the car keys. Come on. Get your car. Sonica, you cannot escape. l am not escaping to live, but to kill someone. Hand me the keys, otherwise he dies right here. Give me the keys. Hold yourfire. Don't shoot. Move back. Take the key. Take the key. Give me the keys. Open the door, sit inside. Come on. What? What? Watching the fun? Go back inside or l'll break you too. Come on. Get lost. The only mistake we made, Mandar sir... ...that we mistook her for a petty girl, like you did. But she's too dangerous, don't underestimate her. A girl that can endure salt on herwounds... ...can't be scared of more pain. Tighten the security around you. Scaring me? You're trying to scare me? l'm just asking you to stay alert. And she's already lost so much in this battle... ...that she has nothing more to lose. l will kill that witch. Kill her. You already tried that. She was half dead... ...when you tormented her boyfriend to death. And she should've been completely dead... ...when you buried her alive in the grave. She's witnessed death so closely... ...that she no longerfears death. And those who don't fear death... ...is the most dangerous person. Think about what l said, sir. And if you need any help from my department... ...then give me a call. See you. l'll disappearfortwo days. lf they don't find me, they won't find you. Thank you. - You're welcome. And... Take this. What is this? Phone number...of someone who wants to help you. He might get you to Mandar as well. Who is he? Call him, you'll know. Sir, the biggest benefit of this land is... ...that it's close to the dam. So we'll get an artificial late... ...and there are poles close-by for electricity. Basically, sir, we're thinking about... ...three types of accommodation. The first is villa. Secondly, we can construct wings... ...and sell flats. You see, sir, these days people preferflats. lt lessens the security hassles.. ...and we won't be responsible forthe maintenance either. And third are row houses. Villa and flats, combined. Why is that door open? Sir...someone must have left it ajar. Actually sir, it's the catering people. They're getting tea and snacks. Close it. No one...no one's coming it. Close it. You can have yourtea and snacks afterthe meeting. Close the door, come on. Snacks... So, the land's close to the dam. And? You two don't move an inch. - Okay sir. There's an interview in progress inside. - Okay. Don't let any outsider in. - Yes, sir. Dolly, listen. Get sir a glass of water... ...and tell the makeup man to be ready in case of sweat. ls that clear? - Okay, madam. Alright. Sir. Since we can have just one debate... ...l would like to know the importance of that diary. How...how many people are allowed in the studio? During the show? There's the EP, Asst. Director and my Cameraman. Do you have security clearance for everyone? Security clearance? Yes, sir. Everyone has an lD. Anyone can have an lD card. This is not right. Only these two cameramen stay here. No one else comes in or goes out. l am very clear on that. Start. Okay, Anuradha, you step out... ...let the cameraman stay in, and... ...you come in only to give your cues during the ad breaks. Alright? Alright? Excuse me. Where is she going? To the control room, sir. How many people in the control room? - 10 12... 10 or 12? Please tell me. 12 l think, sir. Do you know their names? Why would l know their names? They are interns, technical staff... lf you don't know their names, then who does? This is not safe. There's no security here. But, sir, this is a news channel. Why would anyone do anything here? lncidents happen where people least expect it. You know that. This interview continues at my home. l am sorry, sir, but this is a debate. You please can't... To hell with your debate. But, sir...please, sir. Sir... Let's go, sir. What are so many people doing here? lt's the inauguration of a club... ...there's bound to be people here. Let's go home. Come on. Sir...what are you doing? People are waiting for you. l promised the organizer as well. ln fact, he donated a large amount for our party fund. Do you want to donate my life forthat? Tell me...what do you know? What do you know? - About what, sir? About her. She's waiting for me right here. You know that, don't you? She'll hide in this crowd and kill me. That's your plan, isn't it? What are you saying, sir? - Get out. Out. Get out you f idiot. Take me home quickly. Out! Out! Out! No...it'll be done. l'll do something. l'll do something. lt'll be done...there will be no problem. You're back soon. Shall l serve dinner? - l am not hungry. Eat something, just a little... - l said l'm not hungry. Stop blabbering. You look tired, l'll get you milk. You'll sleep peacefully. Who was he talking to? Was he... l'll call him inside and ask. Milk! You... Looking for your gun? l got rid of it. Always get rid of things we don't need... ...you taught me this. Wedding vows don't make you... ...a virtuous husband Mandar Mhatre. lf you want to be revered, then you need to act accordingly. Father used to say... ...affection in eyes of the wife... ...and weapon in the hand of the lover, are only for pretence. Come on, give me the gun. Come. Let's reshuffle all the pawns... ...and restart the game. Give it. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Mad dogs... ...and crazy elephants... ...are meant to be shot down. l wish yourfather had taught you that. My parents died when l was a kid. My grandma used to live here. But after she passed away... ...this house has remained locked. And no one will imagine that... ...you're hiding in a police officer's house... ...who is looking for you. Thank you. Since l became a police officer... ...this is the first time l felt l did my duty. Anyway, don't step out of the house too much... ...and if anyone asks, then just say you're my sister Veronica. Thank you. Take care, Sonica. Bye. When he came home he looked worried. When l asked whether he'll have dinner, he refused. l went to my daughter's room to tuck her in. And that's when... That's when l heard the gunfire. l ran to her room and... You took your revenge. Finished your battle against God? Sonica, you should now go to a hospital... ...and get yourself treated. Because...you can't live like this. Everyone has to die someday, Akshay. Sonica, don't argue. Please, don't argue, Akshay. lf l get myself treated... ...then l'll stop seeing you. lf what's the point of living... ...if l can't see you. But, Sonica... - Akshay, please. Stop saying such things. l'd rather die seeing yourface... ...than live without you. Akshay... ...say those things again. Which one? About us. ''l in love with you all over again.''
