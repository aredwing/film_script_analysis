Let's do this, Cory. Good afternoon, Grizzlies' fans. Welcome to Grizzly Stadium. And today's ballgame between your Denford Grizzlies and the Peninsula Pilots. Today is Young Life day at the ball park. If a Grizzly hits a home run during today's game, Young Life will be presented with a check for $10,000. Let's go, guys. Here we go, guys. Good luck. It's time, guys. Go Grizzlies. Hey, Cory. Hey, Helene. Heard you were chatting up with Capano at the fundraiser last night. Oh, come on, Helene, you're the only girI for me. I'd better be. He had to be really drunk to think that was a good deaI. Please. He'd eat his first born if it meant signing a new player. I don't think I signed anything. All right. Don't forget. Home run today. 1 OK for Young Life. Okay? You think Cory will remember that Carlos is down there? No clue. Or even who Carlos is? I don't know. Tough conditions for the hitters today. Sun shining down brightly. And when you've got guys like Chris Ashman and Brett Stevens on the mound it's not at all a surprise that we have a scoreless game with only five hits so far. Cory Brand batting 3-79 leading the league. And he appears to be a shoo-in for another all-star game next month. Hee-yah. Open your eyes, Blue. Cory's not going to like that call. It appeared to be high and outside. De Cruz gave Ashman the call of strike one. Strike two. Strike two. That was way outside. What are you swinging at that for? You're going to your momma? You need to go talk to your momma now? Get in the box. Go, Cory. Three. And it gets away from the left fielder. Go, go, go, go, go, go. He's going to try to score. Slides and safe. That's what I'm talking about. The Pilots are going to appeal it. And Cory Brand has been called out. What are you talking about, Blue? He storms out of the dugout, and gets right in the face of umpire Vic Cruz. He's going to be thrown out for slamming down the helmet. And the replay shows he clearly missed third base. So, Cory Brand about to give his team the lead. Answer you, Blue. Why don't you cool off? You're like your brother Blue over there? How did you not see that standing right there? What are you talking about I ain't touch base, huh? Touched it now! There it is. There it is. Get out of my face. Play ball. And evidently the young bat boy, he's the honorary bat. Oh, my gosh. Hey, what's going on, huh? Doc, is he all right? Not sure what exactly happened. Is he okay? Can you see him? I can't. I'm on, I'm on. As Corey Brand went into the dugout. Oh, my gosh. I think that's enough ice. Your face is going to freeze. Dad, I'm fine. Oh, hey, babe. How are you doing? He's all right. I'm fine, I'm fine. All right, all right. Hey, guys. I'm thinking about sticking around. What? Why? I can't leave him like this. What can you possibly do for him? I don't know. Just talk. Find out what's up. Hey, dude, can I hold your icepack? Just for a second, Tyler. It's an official icepack. Only players and people on the team can use it. And I need it. Here, take it. Dude, the whole stadium was cheering for you. I know. I was like pshhh. Oh, and then I went like, oh, yeah. He's the only brother I've got. All right. I love you. I don't make it easy. Whatever. Hey, bro. What's this, a reunion? Why, did she tell you to come? We should talk, Cory. Talk about what? What happened to you out there today? Showbiz, bro. It's part of the game. I talked to your trainer. Said your blood alcohoI was. 15. Couldn't find my keys in that condition, let alone hit one out of the park. It's a gift. What are you doing talking to my trainer? You need help, Cory. Are we done here? That kid you elbowed today? That's my son. Karen and I adopted him out of foster care two months ago. You'd know that if you read an emaiI or... returned one of my calls. I'm sorry. Want to go grab something to eat? You got fat. Kick your butt. That's without a personaI trainer, and I work for a living. Yeah, what are you, mayor now? District attorney. Got my own parking spot. And a bathroom key. Look at you, fancy pants. Congratulations. How's Emma? She's all right. Been hard on her and Tyler since James died overseas, but she says she's glad to be back in Okmulgee. What do we say we go get you a salad? A salad? Yeah. No cheese. Good morning, Mr. Popular. He's cute. You've been suspended for eight weeks. Well, good morning to you, too, Miss Sunshine. Come here. I want to show you something. "Corey Brand injures bat boy. " A million hits. Already. It was an accident. Can we talk about this later, please? "Boozes it up in Vegas. " 364,908 hits. That was a good night. "Drunk at a Strip Club. " 217,402 hits. You're a disaster. Yeah, well, I'm a 3-27 career hitter. "Cory Brand DUl Caught on Tape". Over a million hits. Yeah, it looks a little bad when you put them all together, all right? But there were a lot of sober moments in between them. You still got that condo in Miami? Floor is a little warped. Popped the water bed. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to fly to Tulsa and drive down to Okmulgee. I'm not going to Okmulgee. Oh, yes, you are. You're going to Okmulgee and make nice with the kid. And then I'll arrange a very public photo op. The kid has a name. It's Carlos. Carlos is going to get a bag full of crap from the Grizzlies, and a photo op with a celebrity. Then go chill on the beach in Miami for eight weeks. Yeah, lucky me. Plus, the Grizzlies want proof that you're attending a 12-step program. 12-step? They want you out of sight untiI you've completed eight weeks. And last but not least, you're writing a check for $10,000 for Young Life, for that homer you screwed up. I'll see you in Tulsa. Ladies and gentleman, welcome to Tulsa International Airport. Local time is 3:34 and the temperature is 98 degrees. Hey, you didn't have to waste so much money renting such a fancy car. Don't worry about it. How do you even get in this thing? It's got no handles. We're here to help farm boy. Oh, man, Mr. Arby's forgot my curly fries. Hey, don't make me go back in there, okay? That guys nearly cried when I signed his hat. He did not. A grown man. There were tears. Right. Hey, don't forget the Arby's sauce. I got it. Oh, these are so good. Come on, let's go. Thank you, sir. You satisfied? CarefuI. Were you drinking on the plane? Let's see what this baby can do, huh? No, let's not. Let's. Would you please slow down? Woo-hoo. Cory, look out. So, my Little League team is playing the Chiefs this week. I'm going to start reading for the Bulldogs. We're going to run them into the ground. They're not going to know what hit them. Yeah, I love running them into the ground. Hey, go to the car. I need to talk to this hot rod. I don't care what your District Attorney brother says. I will put you in jaiI. Hey. There you are. You better pray your brother can keep this DU I under wraps. You are now facing a ton of fines on top of what the Grizzlies are going to give you. What do you want me to do? You better hope for a suspended sentence. And could you just try to stay out of trouble while I cover your butt, huh? Oh, jeez, the kids are here. What kids? Stop when you get inside. My brother has a baseball team. Your brother is the kids' baseball coach? Why don't you just shoot Bambi next time, Cory? Jeez. Cory Brand. Game face, Cory. Yeah. Good evening, folks. I'm Helene Landy. Did you sustain any injuries. What happened? As I was saying, Mr. Brand is happy to report other than a few bumps and bruises that he's doing okay. Cory, how's your brother? He's okay. Clay Brand is resting comfortably while sustaining some injuries. What are we talking about? Cory, have you been suspended by the Grizzlies? Was there alcohoI involved in the accident? There was a tractor involved in the accident. And... out of love for his brother, Mr. Brand has kindly offered to stay here in Okmulgee and take his brother's place as head coach of the kids' baseball team. Cory Brand's coaching kids' baseball? That's right. Lucky team. Do the parents know their kids are going to have Cory as a coach? Does this mean you're moving to Okmulgee? That's enough. As you can imagine, Mr. Brand's had a long day. We'll release a statement tomorrow following the team's first practice. Thank you. Cory, is the field going to be big enough for all the crowds that are going to be there? You are way out of line this time. No, you are, and I'm fixing it. Dang, I'm good. I'm not doing it. Oh, that should be shelved. It's on mine by now. Next conversation? Now, go see about your poor brother while I find you a place to live. Hey. How's our guy doing? He wants two minutes with you and then I want you to leave. Hey, buddy. A bit early in the day for a DU I. I don't know what you're saying. Don't-don't even try. I did what I could for you legally. I never thought my baby bro would be bailing me out. I didn't baiI you out. I'll vouch for you. Just don't go skipping town. I'm back. Just the look of those polyester bedspreads make me itch. Okay, kid, listen up. I found you a 12-step program. There you go. You couldn't find me a normaI program? Well, it is normaI. It's just, um, with Jesus. I'm not doing church. You're doing whatever it takes to get your butt back on the roster. Besides, it's the only game in town. Celebrate Recovery? If your career recovers, trust, I will celebrate. Cheers. Yeah, cheers. Right. All right. Hey, hey, where are you going? I'm staying at Tulsa. I'll drive back tomorrow. What for? Apology to the kid, press event. The only reason we rode into this one horse town. Well, how am I supposed to get around? You're a big boy. Figure it out yourself. I'll see you on the field tomorrow. And if you're smart, you'll come ready to coach. Just remember, you're happy to be doing this for your brother and for the children. Night. Hey, is that your truck? You want to rent it? My truck? Five hundred bucks for the month? Okay. What's your name? Chad. Hey, Chad, I'm going to need those keys. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thanks, man. Cory Brand. Yeah, I know. Hey, Chad, you know, my fridge in there is empty. You know what I'm saying? Um, I could fill it for you. With dull beverages. And to remember to keep filling it with the dull beverages. Thanks a lot, Chad. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank you guys so much for coming out today. What's up, slugger? Cory Brand. Looks like you got your nose on straight. I am so sorry about that. Oh, that's okay. Oh, we've got some Grizzlies gear that's got your name written all over it. Awesome. Thanks. Let's get that on straight for the pictures. Okay, there we go. Stan, that's Cory Brand. No duh, Kendricks. It's all over the Internet that he starts today. Carlos, how about that famous thumbs up sign? Go Grizzlies. Go Grizzlies. Come here. Get that camera right here. Go Grizzlies. Big smiles, big smiles. Hey. Are you ready? He doesn't know yet? I don't think so. Oh. Oh, please, Suzanne is here? In heels. She hasn't been here all season. I can't believe you're our coach. We need major help. You'll see. We're not even close to as good as the Roughnecks. They can hit the ball so far, like as far as that building over there, which is where you can get the best ice cream. Ah, it's ridiculous. Come on, guys, warm up, tickle up. Oh, mom. Come on. Do I get to call you coach? Sure. Okay, everyone. We are done here. Thank you. Cory, your suspension hit the wires today. Thank you, everyone. Let's go. Good luck, kid. We'll see you around, Carlos. Hey, Carlos, what's your favorite ice cream flavor? Vanilla. Why are we always running? This bites. My dad says the Grizzlies suspended Cory Brand. Pejerski says he drinks like a fish. Fish don't actually drink. They use their gills. Wikipedia, give it a rest. Who is that woman? His agent. Yeah, I got to go do this. Okay. Stomachache. Breathe. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, where are you going? Home. We're so good. I'll call you in a few days. What am I supposed to be doing? Start coaching. Cory Brand. Emma Johnson. It's Hargrove. I mean, it's-it's been Hargrove for the last ten years. Right, sorry. I, uh... Wow, it's good to see you. Yeah. Well, thanks for, thanks for coming out here today. I appreciate it. Um, I'm actually one of the Bulldogs' other coaches. Yeah. Look, um, I know you're caught up in some big PR mess, but let's be reaI. These parents are never going to go for you coaching their kids. The are salt- of-the-earth people. And you're pretty much just a wild child felon to them. Wild child felon or not, you guys are short a coach. Yeah, but we don't need you. Here comes the truth. I mean, they'll probably tell you that they've got a volunteer and you can be on your way. Dan Stanton. I own the hardware store and gas station. Welcome home, Cory. Cory Brand. Greg Kendricks. It's an honor to meet you. We're thrilled to have you here. It's a reaI treat for these kids. Not to mention us dads. If you need anything, please feel free to call the store. Awesome. Thanks, guys. That's great. Right. See you. So... ready to get started, Coach? Look, these kids will like you and you will leave them, so keep your distance. Third base is yours. It's your only responsibility. Mom, can we do something else? It's so hot. Tyler, you can't just walk over here. It's just so hot. Oh, hi, I'm Tyler. Hey, man. Cory Brand. Tyler, get back out there with the rest of the team. Okay. Em, is that... Look, I'm begging you, keep your distance. Third base. Everything looked fine on the outside, but, uh, inside it was a definite mess. What started as a private curiosity became, uh, something I couldn't stop. Eventually, I was looking at porn at work. Until the day two security officers confiscated my computer and escorted me out of the building. They had every website and every minute I spent looking at them, logged right there in black and white. I've... never felt such shame and embarrassment. My porn addiction and my unwillingness to face it, led to the loss of my family, my job, and my self-worth. Depression followed. How is it going? Good. John Townsend. Folks call me J.T. Yes, my agent told me to find you. You're the one who's going to be signing off all my paperwork. Hey, listen, I think I landed in the wrong room over there. I'm just looking for, you know, basic 12-step program. I think I ended up with the sex addicts. Not that I'm judging. It's just... You're in the right room. Just takes a while to know it sometimes. Here's how it works. After the main meeting, we break into small groups. We call open share, where we talk about anything from chemically dependent, sexual addictions, childhood abuse, eating disorders and so on. Huh. What if you have them all? If you have them all, then one day at a time. I'm the ministry leader, so if you have any questions, concerns, jokes you feeI like you need to tell, I'm the one to talk to. Uh, well, I think I'm going to head back in there. All right. Good to meet you. Yeah, I still can't believe people are talking like that in church. Good to have you, Cory. Thanks. But God changed everything. He changed me. Long story short. My wife and I were reunited in marriage last August. Because of my time in Celebrate Recovery, I know how to run to God and his people when I need help. And he does help me every time. Thank you for letting me share. Welcome to everyone to open share. I'm J.T. I'm a gratefuI believer of Jesus. I'm currently struggling with alcoholism. Hey, J.T. My name is Rick, and, uh, I'm a Christian. And I'm struggling with cocaine addiction. Hi, Rick. Oh, I'm Cory. Currently struggling with my agent. We're glad you're here, Cory. Hey, Coach. What's up, slugger? Hey, Coach. Hey, Tyler. You guys ready to work hard today? Yes, sir. How weird is this for you. Weird? Actually more like scary. So, what are we going to practice today? Sliding? No, we need to practice our batting. We suck. I mean stink. Could always work on winning. That'd be nice. You're having any feelings for him? You can't be serious. Yeah, actually I'm feeling that he's in my space and he needs to go off to his big far away life. Hey, hey, Tyler. Tyler, come check this out. Your mum and Cory Brand were the best couple in high schooI. No way. First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes... Mom, why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? Where did you get that? My dad. Oh, really? Remind me to thank him. You know, I'm going to keep this untiI after practice, okay? Keep what? It's nothing. Let's go. What is it? Nothing. Let me see. No. It's our year book. Yeah. What do we go here, boys? Look at how adorable you are. Okay. Hey, Coach, does this mean that you and Coach Emma K- I-S-S-E-D? Carlos. Oh, you think you're F-U-N-N-Y, don't you? How about you get out on the field for a K-I-C-K your B-U-T-T-Ses? Let's go, boys. You can keep that. Okay. All right, let's go practice, guys. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Atta boy. All right, Kendricks. Let's go, let's bring our boy in. Show us how it's done, girl. Right. Time out, time out. Kendricks, come here. You're a leftie just like me. You're two steps closer to first base. So lay down the right bunt. But there's two outs. Yeah, I know. Trust me. Think like a gazelle, huh? Never look back. All right, let's go, Kendricks. Nice! Nice bunt, Kendricks. Nice job, Kendricks. It's good. Okay, when I touch my ear, that's the indicator, all right? We're going to slide, we're going to steaI, we're going to work on our double cuts. Our pitch outs and our infield shifts. We're going to double steal, hit and run, and suicide squeeze. We're going to fart in some runs if we have to. Give me two laps, and I'll see you at the game on Saturday. Let's go, Stanton. That means you, too, buddy. Play ball. Come on, Caleb, just like practice. Let's go. Hitting strikes, buddy. Caleb, you need to step up in the big boy jeans right now. Start throwing strikes at this team. They can't hit them. It's the Bulldogs for crying out loud. Let's play ball. Let's go, batter. Look at me son. What did I tell you? I said strike... Nice work. I will step into it. I will pull you first thing. Don't make me. I won't tell you again. Say yes, sir. What do you say we lighten up, huh, Coach? And what do you say you play your game, all right? That's my boy. All right, Tyler, my man. Let's go, buddy. Come on now, we got two more. I say now shore up that stance. A little bit closer now. That's okay, Tyler, you stand wherever you want. I know where that ball is going to go. Yeah, just don't step into it. A little bit closer now, Tyler. You stand wherever feels right, baby. Ball. Look at me, son. I'll call your sister. I will call your sister. I'll embarrass you in front of everybody out here right now. You understand me? Son. That's not what we trained for, is it? Now start throwing strikes at this team. They can't hit them. What? You questioning my coaching? Come on. Strike one. See how easy that was? Hey, Coach, all day long. All day long. Come on, Caleb. Strike two. Caleb, two strikes. You know that, right? Can't hit a ball looking at it. Swing at it. Swing at the ball next time. Step into play and swing at it. Get your head in the game. Strike three. You're out. Let's go. Hey, son. When I said get your head in the game, I didn't mean miss the ball... Get over and pick that bat up. Pick that bat up. Let me tell you something. Sit down. You're benched. You understand me? What you say we lighten it up, Coach. I'll deaI with you in a minute. Sit down. What did you just say to me? Let's go, Bulldogs. I said let's take it easy, coach. Did you now? Where do you think he learned that kind of attitude from, Cory? Hey, Dad! Shut up, son. You sit down. Watching idiots like you, Cory. Cory Brand back in town, aren't you? You know what? Let me smell. Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree now, does it? You know what you are, Cory? You're a showboat and you're a drunk, just like your old man. You are both out of here. Thanks, Tony. Nice going, Cory. I wasn't drinking. You weren't arrested for drinking. Hey, I stood up for that kid the way no one stood up for me with Dad. You're looking more like him every day, Cory. That's because I was taking all your hits. All my hits? What do you think happened after you left, huh? You're not the only one that grew up in that house, Cory. Yeah, walk away. That's what you do best, Cory. What? You're killing me. Assaulted an officer? It wasn't assault. This is your lying low? And uploaded photo went from Facebook to... Just fix it. It might take a little effort, but I'm sure you can handle it. My name is Rick. I'm a Christian. I was struggling with cocaine addiction. Hi, Rick. I came to CR not for recovery from crack, but to fake it so that my wife and family would get off my back. I came every week, I did all the lessons. And to my surprise, I began dealing with my past. I started to understand why I used. No. When I got to step nine, make direct amends to the people you have harmed, I thought make amends face to face? I don't think so. So, I skipped over that step. After ushering for two years, the temptation proved to be a bit more than I could handle and I started taking money from the offering each week. During this time, I was in the second-step study, and I-I wanted to finally make the... I needed to finally make the amends to the people in my life. Which meant I had to confess what I had been doing to the ministry leaders. And when I met with them, I... I expected to be relieved of my guilt. I received so much more. I experienced God's love and forgiveness. Now, to complete the step, I need to make amends with you also. Because it's your ministry, too. And I stole from you, and so I stand here and I ask you if you'll please forgive me. The truth is, God forgave me long before I came to CR but... But I still felt broken and I didn't know how to fix it. And then I got here and learned verses like James 5:16 that told me if I confessed my sins to someone, I could be healed. I still mess up. I'm not who I was. I'm changing. I'm getting healed. Thank you for letting me share. I didn't even know they made basketball cards. Tommy. Next limp. More puzzle pieces. Oh, I found Nick. Steve. I found Nick, too. HaI Osberg. Got it. Cory Brand. 2001? Oh, my gosh. Are there any more? Uh, just the one. Dang it. You can have it. He busted me on the nose, so. I think it's bad luck or something. Are you bringing it to the game? Oh, I don't know. Come on, you got to bring it to the game. Yeah, I just don't want to bother him. He signed it. This could be... Fifty cents. You didn't bring enough money? This should do it. If he signs it, this could be worth a ton. We are going to be rich. Bulldogs, huddle up! Now, come on. How about some new uniforms? Grab some hats. Tyler. Yes? That's my number right there. That's you, buddy. Way cooler than the Roughnecks now. Who needs some shoes? Kendricks. New Nike's for you. Here you go, slugger. Size eight. Hey, guys, what do you say? Thanks, Coach Cory. Thanks, Coach Cory. All right, we got to win now 'cause we're looking good, right? Okay. Let's go, Bulldogs. Go, go home. Come on. All right, Kendricks, let's go, let's go. Good job, Bulldogs. Nice, nice. Good work, good work. Atta boy. Atta boy, Carlos. Huh? Syd. Syd. Come on, let's get them. All right, Tyler, come on now. The winning run is on second. That's it, buddy. Step up in there. Come on. Time. Tyler, come here. Tyler, look at me. How many years you been playing ball? Five. All right. How many hits you got before you took one in the face? I don't know. Fifteen, twenty? Yeah. Fifty, sixty? Probably. All right. So, what do you think the chances are of getting hit today? Probably not going to happen, huh? Probably not. Okay. Get back in there, step up to the plate, hit the ball. Okay. All right. Tyler. Nothing great happens when you hold back. Let's go. Come on. There it is! Yes! Carlos, go. Go! Yes! Nice job. Nice play, son. Bring it in, bring it in. Where's Tyler? Tyler! Hey. That's what I'm talking about. Stepping up to the plate. Nice hit. How about that, huh? Great win today, guys. Thanks, Coach. Come on, Carlos. Awesome game, Coach. See you later. Awesome base running, Carlos. Thanks, Coach. Couldn't have done it without you. Come one now. We couldn't have done it without you, Tyler. Great job. Thanks. Thanks. Nice game. Yeah, we made quite the team out there, didn't we? How about we grab some pizza? Yeah. No. Come on, Mom. No, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry. I've got, uh, you know, we've got a thing. Yeah. Have fun at your thing. Cory. J.T. You, uh, have plans tonight? Yeah, you know, some ESPN, little ESPN. Probably some ESPN after that. Nah, I don't have any plans tonight. You want plans? Sure. Pick you at your moteI around 6:00? Six o'clock. See you then, right? Don't be late. It's going to be fun. It sounds like it. In a effort to earn the money you pay me, I scored you a nationaI television interview this Saturday. Well, well, well, so nice of you to finally call me. With the all-star vote coming up, we need to get you back in the public eye looking clean and sober. Get people to fall in love with you again. Oh, please, they've always loved me. Ha. That's because I remind them how much they do love you. Okay, fine. Book it. Let's get me seen. Done. Hey, J.T., I'll be right back. So, this is your thing. Not very hospitable of you, Emma Hargrove, to not tell a poor stranded fooI about the Wild West Chili Fest. FooI, yes. Stranded, never. You get your Ferris wheeI on, yet? You're missing life in the fast lane, aren't you? Yes and no. Beating the Jets today, that was, that was a new all-time high for me. You're right about Tyler. He just needed to be pushed. I get, uh, I get too caught up... You're a great mom. He's a great kid. He is. Hey, dude, it's Coach. Come on. Coach. What's up, guys? Hey, Coach, we found a rookie card today at the store. We were wondering if you could sign it. Sure. I didn't know you guys collected baseball cards. Oh, yeah. All the time. I got some really cooI ones back in the barn. Seventy-three Passy, Ninety-three Begonus. I have Passy and Begonus, too. Yeah? Well, we should get together and compare cards some time. Maybe after this we can go back to the barn and check them out. Oh, come on, come on, please. Okay, sure. Yes. Tug O' War. To one of the best nights of my life. I'm glad you found a thing tonight. Good old Oklahoma. Wait till you see this, guys, huh? How cooI is this. Whoa. How cooI, right? Oh, sweet. All right. Who's this? Dad. Your dad played ball? That's your dad? Yeah, he was a great player. He never made it past AA, though. Come on, where are they, Cory? Where's the box? Where's the box, huh? It's not in here. It's a small wooden box, guys, with a metaI latch. All the important ones are in it, huh? It's got to be here. They're gone. I can't believe it! He must have sold them. That drunk! Oh. What's going on? Look, I just wanted to show the kids, all right? Okay, boys, come on. Get on back to the house, okay? No, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Yeah, right. What is the matter with you? In front of the kids? Stay out of it, Karen. No one's touched your precious stuff in years, Cory. Look, he did, okay? He always messed things up. He always screwed everything up. You can't keep playing the victim. It doesn't work. What do you know about my life, huh? What do you know about anything for that matter? You're just some sheltered Sunday schooI teacher, so spare me the lecture untiI you've lived through something a little more stressfuI than your kitchen sink backing up. I don't want to hear it. Let's go. Okay, kiddo. Lights out. Good night. Night. Love you. Love you, too. Hey. What's this? I know, sort of impulsive, but, uh, I wanted to give her to Tyler. What? Is that a dog? All yours, sport. She's mine? No. Look, it's all there. Training crate, food, leash. What are you doing? You can't just come over here and give my son a dog. I wanted to apologize for last night. By heaping a ridiculous responsibility on him and me? Come on, Mom. Can't we keep him? Tyler, we're not keeping the dog. That figures, you always say no. Every kid should have a dog. You don't get to have a say in what he should or shouldn't have. Look, this whole thing is so not okay. You have to go, and take your dog. Tyler. Come on. Hi. My name is Karen. Hi, Karen. And I'm a grateful believer in Jesus. I Celebrate Recovery from sexuaI abuse by my father from the time I turned eight untiI I was sixteen. While going through these experiences I felt alone, with no one to reach out to, not one person to tell. My whole life I had carried the pain, burden and shame for my past. Even though I've been a Christian for years, I hid my pain and shame from everyone I knew. When I-when I learned as an adult that I would not be able to bear children of my own, this was the final blow. I felt completely abandoned by God. When I attended Celebrate Recovery, I wasn't prepared to experience the freedom and relief I would gain by sharing my deep hurt with God and others. I love that I don't have to hide who I am here. I can go to my step study and share openly without the fear of being judged. I'm just me. Banged up and imperfect. Because of the work of Jesus, I'm no longer living my life in shame. Thank you for letting me share. Go. Run, run. Run! You're running on. All right, Bulldogs. Hey. Why aren't you in the limo? Why aren't you on your way to Tulsa? Any of this ringing a bell? Yeah, hey, about that, we need to reschedule. I am about to blow an artery if you just said what I think you just said. No, I'm serious, we need to reschedule. You are not missing this interview. The Grizzlies just brought up a kid from the Springs, and this kid is good, Cory. And guess what? He's not a pain in the butt. You will not say no. No, all right? I'm not missing my son's game. Your son? Is this some kind of line from Green Acres? No, it's not, Helene, all right? My son's on the Little League team and I'm his coach. Got to go. I'm going to kill him. Everything okay? Yeah, I just forgot I had this TV interview scheduled. Oh, you should go. No, I already told my agent. Forget it, it's done, it's over, too late. Seriously, Cory, it's your career. Go. Believe it or not, we can handle it. No, no, I'm staying. Come on, we got a game to win, coach. Let's go. What's up, Bulldogs? Huh? High fives. Hey, Kendricks. What's up, Coach? Nice day, huh? Yeah. Great breeze. How's your parents? Fine. The pitcher is nervous. Second baseman has got a weak arm. Let's shake things up, huh? You know what I'm saying? Stanton, was that you? Trying to fart in the run. You still see that play? Yeah. Run, Kendricks. Don't throw it. On the go! Don't throw it! Go. Go, Will, go. Go. Go home! Go home! Go home! Yes! There it is. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Nice job, Bulldogs. What's up? We won. Nice. What were we training for all week? Are you kidding me, guys? Woo! Bulldogs! Get on the bus. Take your stuff and let's go. All right, buddy. Yeah. Huh, that's quite a win. It's so good. Watch your hands. Coach. You got rubbed. It's not an all-star team unless you're on it. What are you talking about, buddy? How's the NationaI League going to win if you're not on the team? Come on, let's go, son. See you, Coach. All right, buddy. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just... forgot that news came out today. All right, I'm going to head out. See you, Coach. Good game, Tyler. Thanks. It's going. It's going. It's gone. See you. It's going. It's back. FouI ball. Cory. What are you doing? Hey. Well, I was just wondering how you were doing after the all-star news but I... Well, I see that you're the same as always. I didn't get the vote. No, yeah, I know. I was upset. My career is in the gutter. I'm out here wasting my time. Well, I'm sure it's very disappointing for you. But then, adults cope with disappointment all the time. Ask me how I know. I know, I know I disappointed you. All right? I didn't just leave to go play baseball, you know? Being a father scared the crap out of me. But I've changed, Emma. Clearly. Wait, Emma. Emma, stop. I want to be his father. Really? Really you want to be his father, Cory? Yes, I do. It takes courage to be a parent. It is sheer bravery to love a child. To be there for them, to care for them, to love them when they push you away. It takes courage to put your dreams on hold. To juggle your own heartache and disappointments. And just when you think that you might be getting the hang of things, you lose your husband. So, now you have no choice but to just pull it together and care for the most precious, the most amazing person you have ever known. Parenting is not for cowards, Cory. You ran before. You'll run again. It was a mistake, all right? A huge mistake. The old man said I'd end up resenting you and the kid the way he resented having me. He told me I'd screw up the baby's life. And I believed him, okay? I believed him. So, your only choice was to just write us off? I didn't write you off, okay? You went off and got married. Whatever's broken in you, Cory, whatever your dad did or didn't do, I can't fix it. Neither can Tyler. That hurt inside you is going to hurt Tyler. It already has. He needs a father. Well, he had a father. But he died. And James is the only person that was there for us when you left. And that amazing, unselfish man is the only father Tyler has ever known. And for now that is how it stays. Strike six. You're standing there watching it. Let me see something out of you for once. Strike nine. Come on. Come on, stay in there. Get your elbow up. You can't hit it like that. Strike ten. Come on, you little sissy. Stand up. Go on, go get it. You going to cry now? Is that what I'm seeing? You're going to stand there and cry? You know, I- I-I first thought that, you know, Meth could be like a-like a fun thing, and I could-I could stop any time, but, you know, I wouldn't tweak or nothing, but... coming, coming down was hard. And, uh, I just... I had to have it. I stole from my grandma's purse to get it. I couldn't stop. So, I started, you know, going through these questions. I- I-I forced myself to answer these questions, you know. I- I-I found out why I used. And I still, I still struggle. But I don't feeI, I don't feeI hopeless any more. I... It's getting better. I can... I can feeI myself changing. That, that's... Thanks for sharing. Hey, Cory. This is your eighth week. Huh. Seems so officiaI. Thanks. Yeah. See you man. Hey, you know, it's, uh, it's your last mandatory meeting but we hope you keep coming back. Yeah, all right. It's been good. Congratulations. Thanks, thanks. Looky there. Hey there, boys. Oh. Hi, Officer Pajersky. Hi, Coach. Officer Pajersky. Mm-hm. What are you chewing on? Gum. Paid for it? Yes, sir. Some game you guys played the other night. Thanks. You know we're coming after you next year. I'll see you, Coach. Dude, should we go to my house? Hold up there, Tyler. Looks like you got a new daddy. What? You boys be good. "Cory Brand puts family first. " Hey, is that you? Coach Cory is your dad? Hey, where have you been? I left you like six messages. I got my walking papers. I'm good to go. Yeah, hey, I only got a minute. I've got some bad news. You're free-agent now. You've been released. What are you talking about? Well, it turns out they didn't miss you that much these past two months. Cory, you're too much trouble. Look, it's cool. I've made some calls... Hello? Hey, girI. Yeah, let me ask. Hold on, I'm just getting inside. Hey, babe. Have you seen Tyler? Um... Let me call you back. Come here. Tyler. What are you doing here, Tyler? Hey, what are you doing here, sport? Get in the car, Tyler. Tyler, get in the car. Em. You had no right. I can't believe you used us like this. Tyler, get in the car. Mom, no. Tyler. No. Are you my dad? I have your cards. Your dad gave them to me. He used to mow our lawn. I didn't know they were yours. Tyler. I'm sorry. Get in the car. You lied to me. Got your message. I can't stop. I can't make myself stop. I know. The first step is the most important. Reminding us to surrender to Christ only. If you've identified a new area that you'd like to surrender to Christ or if you've relapsed and you're coming back, I hope you'll come forward today and remember this surrender day. Now please stand for the serenity prayer. God, bring me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, living one day at a time, enjoying one moment at a time. Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace. Taking as Jesus did the sinful world as it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that you will make all things right if I surrender to your will. So that I may be reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with you forever in the next. Amen. My father's work took him away from us most of the time. And my stay-at-home mother was verbally and psychologically abusive. As a child, I lived in a constant state of fear. I believed in God, but I had this warped sense of who he was. And I couldn't trust him. Life, for me, was performance based. But, after going through my step study, I now believe that God is a loving father. He's not waiting to send me to hell for every mistake I make. No matter what my childhood experiences has taught me, I am valuable because I'm a child of God. I'm Cory. And I'm a new believer in Jesus Christ. And I struggle with alcoholism. Hi, Cory. Glad you're here. Oh, come on, you guys, this is pathetic. You got to at least try. Hey. This is like that movie where the lady leaves the children and then it's not fun for them anymore. Hey! What's that movie called, the one with the nun and the singing children? The Sound of Music? Yeah. This is just like The Sound of Music. Except it's not fun anymore without Coach Cory. You're killing me, Carlos. Hi. Hey, girI. Sorry I'm kind of popping in unannounced. That's okay. You want to come in? Uh, is Tyler here? He's around here somewhere. Let's go out here. Uh, Tyler called Clay asking if we would convince you to let him go to the ballgame tomorrow. Oh, he called you? I'm so sorry. Absolutely not. Look, no, I really appreciate that Clay and Cory worked out some stuff this year, and that your family is doing better. No, I'm just not there, yet. Emma... Karen, people don't change. Look, honey, I love you, but the only person who's not changing around here is you. Mom. AII I could say is just taking it one day at a time. I'm in Tulsa now, and just folks are now doing a good job. Would you excuse me? I've got some really important guests. Thank you. Hey, what's up, guys? Huh? Bring it in. How's practice, huh? Hi, Cory. You look great. Good to see you. Yeah? Good to see you, guys. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. They make it? No. Yeah, it's all right. Did you say anything about the Bulldogs to those reporters? Don't be stupid, Carlos. Okay, look, we do get that station. Yeah. You get a player's discount at the gift shop? I think so. Yeah, we can work something out. What do you say we hit some balls? I can introduce you to the team. All right, let's go. Good idea. Get out of here. Batter up, you little sissy. Get your hands together on the bat. Stand in the box. Five minutes. Cory Brand. This boy belong to you? Let me call you right back. He sure does. What's up, buddy? Huh? I'm sorry we missed your game. How have you been? Good. Hi. Hey. How you been? Good. You look good. Thanks. So great to see you, guys. You look great. Thank you. You guys have some time? Yes, please. Please, please, please. Yes, we do. You want to see the field? Yeah. Huh? So, what do you think? Can you pop one over that fence? No. Oh, I bet you could. No, I couldn't. One day. How is Coach Clay treating you guys? Good. Yeah? You guys beat the Roughnecks? Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Coach Pajersky wasn't really happy. I bet he wasn't. Time to go. Oh, come on, Mom. Come on, let's bring it in, sport. Hey, Tyler, come here. What is it? I got something for you. You sure you want me to have it? Belongs to you now. Emma. Thanks for coming. Sure. Hey, listen, there's, uh... There's nothing I can do to make up for what I've done. For what I put you through. And Tyler. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry, Emma. And I hope you can forgive me. Listen, I'm... I'm not asking for anything, okay? But, I want you to know I love this family. I believe in this family and I want to be a part of it as much or as little as you'II let me be. Yeah. Mom? Hm? Nothing great happens when you hold back. Cory. You hungry? Yeah. Let's go. I have left The battle lines There's a hope That lies In front of me I've discovered Who I am And I found I was The enemy I have struggled For so long I lay it down I give it up I'm letting go Of this war I've always known I wave the flag I humbly fall On my knees I have tried To do it all On my own I surrender I've used alcohoI my entire life to replace the love and attention I never received from my father. But every drop of alcohoI, every drop, every one night stand, would never replace the ache inside of me. An ache that only God could fill. I tried to change. But I failed every time. And I know now that I'm powerless without God. But with his help, I found a freedom from my pain and my habits that I never thought was possible. My family has suffered for generations. And I suffered because of my father's pain. And my father suffered because of his father's pain. But this is how it changes. This is where it changes. And today I begin a new story. I'm a child of God. And I have a father who loves me. On and off the baseball field. Thank you for letting me share. Another dream Passes through The night Through the night Another night Cried yourself To sleep Mmmm I'm thinking It's over now This time This time I'm wishing It's over now This time I'm thinking It's over Yeah I'm thinking It's over I'm thinking It's over but now It's your time To change your life Yeah And this is Your moment This is Your moment To change Your life And this is Your moment This is Your moment
