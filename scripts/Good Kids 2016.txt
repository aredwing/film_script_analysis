Yeah, we'll probably roll it over. Are you going into forensics? Why would we go there? I think we're just gonna stay here. Yeah. Suit yourselves. Hammer toss! Oh, shit! Hold up. Extra large slush puppies? Really? You know, I don't care what they say, you guys know how to party. Seriously. Seriously. I hate this town. Are you kidding me, man! Whatever drugs everyone is on seem to be working pretty well. Is this the big reward? I mean, did we really not get invited... To any graduation parties? Come on, if you don't get invited to a single party... For four years straight, you don't generally get invited... Yeah, well, it's graduation, you graduate together as a class... So you'd think after... Dude, we traded cool for college. Yeah, i... All I'm saying is, I'm looking at this thing... And I don't feel as good as the people out there. We're just sitting here. Bro, what were you expecting? I don't know. Something cool. I'll just take us home. Hello, Andy. Hey, Yaco. Have you been looking forward to another summer... As much as I have? Last year you were only a janitor. Groundskeeper, actually. But this year you're a pro! You realize this could only happen with my blessing. You are my beggar apostle and I am your Christ. Well, I appreciate you putting in a good word with the board. After lunch, you'll be teaching the beginner ladies classes... And Salvatore will be handling the men. Okay, cool. Any tips for the new guy? Do not let the women chat with each other. Once they start, they learn nothing. You have to be a man. Yeah, my dad says that, too. Muay Thai, punch! Guys, in the post-apocalyptic future, in which we survive by eating cats and the elderly, you will need to know how to punch. Stop smiling. In the future, smiling will be seen as a sign you wish to be eaten. Hai! As a parting thought... Remember, the prickliest cactus can still give you water. Class dismissed. What did that cactus mean? What do you think it means? Something scary can be good? That's right. Don't be afraid of something for how it looks... Because it might be special inside. Hey, you! Hi! Oh... olive, you know this lady? She's my cousin! Hey, hey, I'm just making sure. Rival Dojos are trying to steal my students all the time... Because you're the best. I'm Tinsley. Olive's mom asked me to pick her up. How's it going? I'm the lion. I haven't seen you before. Yeah, I come here every summer. I haven't seen you before. Oh yeah, I'm one of the locals. Oh, wow, I don't think I've ever met a local. They hide us during the summer... So we don't upset the tourists. The lion should come to your party. Yes, I'm having a party at my parent's house... On the point this afternoon. You should come! I'm sorry, are you inviting me to a party? Yeah, I am. But... but, I'm me. You can bring whoever you want. I'll see you later today. Bye. - Take care. - Thank you! See you, guys. Was that fun? Yeah! Oh! You are the man, lion! Good looks! Good looks! Wow, you weren't even nervous, bro. I'm all right. No, I was pretty nervous. So, Andy, have you heard anything... From your imaginary Indian pen pal? Yes, she actually wants to come to the cape... In August before she goes to UCLA. Whoa... But apparently, it's $2,000 to get her here from Mumbai... In the summer, so I want to figure out a way to help. So, out of curiosity, when she emails you... Does it go to your spam folder and you have to drag it out? Yeah, sometimes, because she's from a far away place. Uh, okay, have you guys skyped at all? No, she's from a remote area and her family's computer... Doesn't have a working camera. It's not a scheme, you guys, okay? She's exists! Bro, I still don't entirely understand how you met her. I told you a million times, she's an econ nerd, too... She posts comments on a website that I read and I emailed her... That I liked her ideas and we hit it off. It's your murderer... These are the last months of your life, bro. Let's say that this girl is real. She's gonna have way more experience than you. Okay, Cleopatra, how do you know that? Under what scenario could a human being on this earth... Not have more experience than you? I've been... I've done... I've done things. Oh, and India has the Kama Sutra, bro. Exactly! India has the Kama Sutra. Yeah, they like, fuck sideways and shit, bro. That's intimidating for anybody. It is. I'm not intimidated. Did that shirt shrink in the wash? No, I don't know, I can't really figure out what happened. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, yes! Sweet! Wow, crazy! Just a little something new I'm working with. If I can't impress my friends, there's no way I'm gonna... Be impressing the food network, so... dig in! Oh, yeah, this looks great. Guys, guys, guys... I waited until we were all together... To bring this up, but I have information. About what? About a party on the point. To be specific, I have an invitation to a party... On the point this afternoon and I can bring anyone I want! Okay, calm down. Who invited you to the point? I've never been on the point. Yeah, me, neither. You're sure this is true? We're invited to an actual party? Bro, bro, bro, no, it's real! And it starts today and goes all night! I'm assuming, I'm assuming. I don't know, man, I gotta finish up here after lunch. I have an 11:00 o'clock curfew... So it's like it doesn't even make sense to go. Two "no's" immediately from the group! I mean, you're going to Harvard, why do you need a curfew? Curfews are for riot zones and crumbling dictatorships... Not for us! Dramatic. Lion, what would happen if you missed your curfew today? Huh? You're going to Mit on scholarship. You know, my parents actually don't get home... Until like 4:00 am most weekends. I'm starting to think they're swingers, man. Stanford-bound spice, you? I've been here until 2:00 before. My parents will probably just think I'm here. There you go. What are you trying to say, bro? - Andy! - Dude! Whoo! Whoo! You know I have to clean that up, right? That was badass! Yes! Yeah! Yes! Breaking stuff! You know I work here, don't you? I'm sorry about the glass, I'm trying to make a point. The reason that we never partied in high school... Is because we wanted to get out of here. And now we are! And I feel like I missed out on some... Experiences and I know you guys do, too. Lion, what do you wish you'd done? Uh... ancient Asians took this mushroom called... Fly Agaric, by feeding it to reindeer and drinking... Its urine for psychedelic effects. What? You're talking about doing some drugs? Put some drugs in you! Nora, what do you want to do? Uh, I think it would have been cool to have a boyfriend. Why are you laughing? I don't... I don't think we knew that. It's not that uncommon a thing. Go get yourself a boyfriend! Wow, thank you for your approval, Andy. Spice? Talk to me. You know, I'm ready to hook up with a girl. Mm-hm. I need release. Release, release! Say no more. Thank you. We know what that means. Yeah, I do. What I'm saying, is this afternoon, starting at this... Party, we do all the things that we wish we'd done... The last four years. Drinking, drugs, sex... With girls. Release yourself! Relationships! I want hard miles! I don't want to go to college as some lamb... Being led to slaughter. I don't want to be boring anymore. From now on, this is the summer of "yes!" Let's just say, "yes!" Say, "yes!" Yes! Say, "yes!" Yes! Spice? Hell, yeah. Yeah! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! All right, welcome to summer! Okay, Gabby, here we go. Whoa, Gabby! Oh! That's it! I love your visor, Mrs. Jones. Here's our star player right here. - This is our star tennis player. - Whoo! You just dance around the court. That winter was too long, huh? Uh-huh! Too long. Nice! Strong! Beautiful stroke. That's way over there, that's a bench shot. We'll give you a couple points for hitting the bench. Okay, Gabby, here we go. Now, Gabby, you're doing this, right? And we're going to need more of just sort of like a this, right? Good group, great group, wow. Andy? Yeah? When did you turn 18? Uh, January. Happy birthday. It was, uh... You know what? You should come over for drinks sometime. 18 is the drinking age in most of the world. I should have been born foreign. Being a tennis pro automatically makes you foreign. Well, then, c'est parfait. You're not! Thinking. Andy, do you teach private tennis lessons? Don't all pros? In my experience. Hm... Why in the world would Danya be sending bikini pictures... To you that early in the morning on a Sunday, bro? She is an insomniac, that's why... And it's not unusual for her to email me late. You are so talking to a guy sitting in his attic... In Worchester wearing clown makeup. Let's do this, guys. Here we go. Let me see. Right here, the lion, great. Hey, you guys have a good time, be safe, okay? We'll see ya. All right. Thank you. Okay! We're gonna go to a party! I just think that this... It's crazy that this is in our town, you know what I mean? I know, that this actually exists here... Like minutes away from us. Right. Whoa. It's like if George Washington... And Norman Rockwell fucked and had kids and they had houses. Oh, dude! I finally know how bad our lives suck. This is crazy. Massive. That is a shitload of individuals. Can I just park here? If you're going to park here, Andy... You have to be really careful, seriously! He's gonna hit... I'm not gonna hit anything. What a nice spot we got! Should we like kick it for five or 20 minutes? No, we're going in. Just say, "yes." Say, "yes." Wow, I am a prairie dog in heaven right now. I don't know what to do with my hands. I think... should we just go... Yeah, we go right in there, right? Everybody's, yeah... Hey, oh, nice, so, where are the drinks? Yes. Right. I feel like I could have told you that. You the man, bro. Okay. Do they have beers, too? We don't belong here. Yes, we do. All right, we're just uncomfortable... Because we don't have drinks in our hands. Let's go. The drinks are up there. What are you doing? No idea! Ooh, shoot. Okay... okay... drinks. Starting now, "yes" to everything. Yes! Yes! Yes! Dude, I'm gonna... It's like fire in my body. I'm gonna throw up! There's a fire in my body. No, seriously, I wouldn't lie about Midgetville. And for the record, we wish it was called something else... Too, but... maybe we can be the change. I don't know what I'm saying. These guys are different. Dragon. Oh... Rahrr... Nora! Thought I saw you. Come have a cigarette. No, I don't... I don't... Come on. Of course, I do, because it's the summer of yes. So pretty. You have that right. Tinsley, this is Nora. Hey. Hi. Hi, Tinsley. We work at the lab together. Thank you. Oh... Well, that's so... you're here, we're both here, that... Yeah, I'm staying down the road with some friends... And their son dragged me along. Oh, cool. I think I'm the oldest person here by about ten years. I love your dress, by the way. Oh. God, I wish I had boobs like yours. Hmm. There's no way, it's the hardest dessert to make in the world. No, I'm telling you, spice could make a souffl right now... And it would be delicious. It would instantly collapse. This party's loud. No, no, okay, I bet you $100... $100 that I could make a souffl right now... And it'll stay standing, it will not collapse. You're on. $100? Hey, give me those mitts! Is that flour? Oh, that's cocaine! What are your hidden talents, Andy? My hidden talents... Well, it's pretty useless... But I can catch food thrown from any distance, in my mouth. Mmm, okay. Oh, you're gonna do it? Okay. You can go bigger than that. Okay, wait, okay, I'm not... I'm serious... I'm not messing around right now! Come on! I catch stuff! I catch stuff in my mouth! I catch marshmallows in my mouth! Woo! Is he doing, high Tai chi? "High chi?" Just say, "yes?" Summer of yes, this is good, this is good. I don't like cold water... So, maybe we can take our clothes off inside. Oh... yes... yes. It has risen! I am the greatest chef on this planet! Consider comping the check? We can think of something. Take off those mittens. Hey. Hi. I think this is the part where you take your clothes off, too. Yeah, me, yeah. You're like freakishly tall, huh? Yeah. That's a really cool bag. Or is it a clutch? Or... You haven't done this before, have you? No. And I actually need like 10,000 practice hours before August. Malcolm Gladwell, outliers? Yeah, I need to be an expert. Why? I have this Indian girl coming to visit me. They have the Kama Sutra. I... exactly. But, I'm sorry, I'm like talking about another girl and... On the bed... now! Yes... on the bed. Relax. We can at least knock a couple of minutes... Off those 10,000 hours. Are you gonna keep doing that face? I know, it's... I feel like making out on the beach... Is less comfortable than it looks on TV. Yeah. Your body is amazing. Really? Yes! Whoa, thank you. That's new. Yeah? Yeah. I understand what you want, but I'm not a hand job machine! I have to feel special about someone... Before I give them a hand job. I thought the souffl was special. If you had tried some subtlety... Instead of moving your hips all creepily... You would have got one. But... Go fuck your souffl! Where have you been? We have been worried! Sorry. What have you been up to tonight? Not too much... goodnight. Please just send me to my room. Thank you. What do you think happened to him? I don't know, but I'm jealous. Oh, jeez, feel free to pass me a new skull, man, honestly. Yeah, no, I can feel my brain decaying lobe by lobe. Andy, hey, Andy! Dude. Oh! That's what I'm talking about. Why are people throwing food at you? Oh, you were skinny dipping with a 30-year-old man... During my performance. It was glorious. When did you get a body, anyway? Last night. Hmm, that's pretty crazy. You're finally a girl. Thank you. Must have been awkward today with your coworker. No, no, we're gonna actually hang out again later this week. Alone? Yeah... summer of yes. Are you hanging out with anybody alone, lion? Oh, uh, just some guys who have an opium connection. Well, you guys had fun... I don't think that girl wants to see me again. No release? Not a drop. But I did get us invited to another party... on a dock. Two rich girls invited me. Boom. Round two! Really? Yeah, man! Guys, guys? Have we somehow become cool? Whoa, whoa. Hey. Hey, you again. Um, I'm actually here to teach a lesson. And to pick up my car from the party. We walked home. Lion swam, I think. See ya! Gabby, it's Andy! It's lesson time. Uh, Gabby, are you in here? I'm almost done. I left your money on the night table. Okay, okay, cool. I'm so glad you could come. Me, too. It's weird, I didn't see your court coming in here. That's because there is no court. Holy shit! Gabby, wait, Gabby, what are you doing? Gabby... Gabby! Shut up, Andy. Okay. Five times? Five times. It's like the olym... The Olympics or something. The "vagathalon." Hey, all right. Hey now. What kind of tennis lesson takes three hours? Oh, we were just, uh, working on strokes... techniques. Forehand, backhand... grips. See ya! I think the lion is taking acid. Yeah, he said he wants to push his body to its limits. Does Tai chi help with fighting? Bruce Lee once said... "A wise man can learn more from a foolish question... "Then a fool can learn from a wise answer." Have you ever used it to fight? When it's finally time for me to fight... I'll know. Oh jeez, look at that. Who's this guy? Is he her boyfriend now or something? What kind of Australian is named, Erland? Who cares, she's happy. He's 12 years older than her. Yeah, and if I was 30 years old... I'd be wanting to nail 18-year-olds too, man. Guy's a creep. Holy shit! Hm? You like Nora! I like nor... are you out of your mind? She's been my friend since I was born. Yeah, and until recently she's dressed like a guy... And you've looked like an acupuncture needle. You're jealous. Look, I don't know what I'm feeling. You poor, sensitive, tragic soul, you. Three days ago, a 42-year-old woman paid me... To have sex with her. No. Yeah, "private tennis lesson." I've got two more scheduled with her this week. How's that for sensitive? Not sensitive at all. Holy shit, man! You know how I'm gonna prove to you that Danya is real? I'm gonna fly her out here myself. I'm gonna put her up in a fancy bed and breakfast. I'm gonna seduce her at fine dinners... That I pay for and it's gonna be magic. Ha! Now, if you'll excuse me... I've gotta wash off the sight of that. Whoo! Andy! Fuck, yeah! Andy? Victoria! Hey, looking good out there. Thanks. Um, you know, Gabby told me that you were giving private lessons. $150 an hour, is that right? You... you mean a full lesson? Yeah, a full lesson. Tomorrow at 4:00, okay? My schedule is open, I can do it tomorrow, I can... My address is on the call sheet. What! Oh, you're so much hotter than my mom! Yeah! Oh, my god! And this. I will end you... ready? S'il vous plait! S'il vous plait... ow! And this, please. Open that pretty mouth. Another hole-in-one. Can you please stop using Qi gong to influence the ball? This isn't fun for us. Andy, Qi gong isn't something I can just turn on and off. Right, I'm gonna try my hand at this. Oh, stop traffic. Yes. Oh, my, thank you. Did you guys pay a hot girl to follow you around? Great strategy, seriously. I think that's Nora Sullivan, dude. Yes, my name... I'm Nora. Holy shit, you're right. Way to get in early, guys, seriously... I like the strategy. Hey, honestly. Are you sexually active? That's so offensive. You know what, and also, you guys never talked to us... Before, so you don't really get to start now. Can you just fuck off! All right, Nora. Wow. Okay, all right... I thought she was quiet, it's cool. Okay, we'll catch you guys on the last hole, all right? We'll fuck off for now, we'll be back later. Bye-ee! Jeez... God, I hate those guys. How do they not know people like us now? Hey man, it's just different circles. Hey, speaking of different circles. Now how is that "airland" doing? Erland? Erland. Does he have talents aside from being handsome? He tries to write pop songs. Oh, no, Australians do have a natural sense of rhythm. Look, he's 30, you're 18, he's not with you... Because he wants you to edit his post-doctoral thesis. Um, I'm pretty sure that you and I discussing... My relationship is none of your business. Relationship? Yes! It's a relationship? Yes! Is he your boyfriend? Yep... yep. He's my boyfriend. There's no way he's your boyfriend! I'm done with mini golf... So I'll just wait in the car for you guys? Is that cool? So... Nora? Are you serious? You're calling her out on the age difference? Yo, lion, you know Andy here has been having sex... With older women from the club for money. Holy tits, you're a hooker? Pound that shit. I'm not... thank you. I'm not a hooker. I'm... getting some experience and I'm teaching them lessons. Dude, they're not lessons! God... They're technically lessons. Please don't be a catfish. Are you just rhyming my name with other girl's names? Have you tried to rhyme your name? Girls' names are all there are. Something on your mind? I, uh, got into a fight with a friend at mini golf, it was bad. You want to do something to get out of your head? Well, what are you thinking? The world behind the curtains. Crap, this is so cool. And here is the autonomous underwater vehicle, "fetch." Fetch. Center point of our research. Uh-huh. Collector of good data on specimens... Ranging from the Acan coral... From the Netherlands Antilles... Through to the fur seal populations... In the Shetland islands of Antarctica. And black hydrothermal smoker vents in the Galapagos. That's correct, yeah, black smoker hydrothermal vents. These things are worth like... A quarter of a million dollars a piece. Ten more years of education... And maybe I'll feel like I actually deserve to be in here. This is a robotics lab, are you joking? No. Are you my boyfriend? Come on, Nora. Are you? Yes, yes, of course, I'm your boyfriend, Nora. Hmm. I care about you. Do you? I do. How much? I... have this! Oh, my god. Okay, okay, but you've gotta admit... You'd have a virginity story... Better than any of your friends, right? Who the hell says that I'm a virgin? Clearly, you've never been to a national high school leaders... Of tomorrow conference. Yeah, clearly I haven't. Hm? What's the matter? Uh, nothing. It's just girl stuff. Client? You understand, I'm not a prostitute, right? I'm going to Dartmouth. Well, then you should have waited to start... Your career as a sex worker until you got to New Hampshire. No state income tax. You think I have to declare this? Gabby, I'm home! Whoa! Oh, my god, you have to go! Is that...? Go that way now! My clothes are in... I don't care, my husband's gonna walk in this... go, go! Woo-hoo! Don't you look handsome. Stupid! You're so stupid! You are so stupid, you are an idiot, you're dumb. No, no, no. They've made some great additions to this course. It's challenging, but fun. They also have go-karts at this place now. Thank you for this blanket, by the way. Yeah, just make sure it's all the way... Between you and the seat. Golden boy! What are you in for, naked insider trading or something? Huh? Hey, numbers in the nude! Calculous with your cockulous? Aw... it's great to see you, Plymouth rock. Why is he making fun of you, you know about math? A little bit. Can I ask you something? Sure, you have me under arrest. I'm taking out a mortgage. These numbers just don't seem to add up. I'm not a banker, but I can take a look. Okay, so, that's it, the problem here is that this number here... Is based on a 30-year amortization... When you wanted a 20, right? Right. Your instincts were right, this is a clerical error. They blew it. Hey, thank you, man. You probably saved me a ton of money. Well, you have good reason to be upset at your lender. Now, does this maybe change things... In terms of the naked in the car situation? What? No! I already wrote it up. You know you can't just drive around town... Showing your ass like that, right? You know, I'm just saying... You know that? I do you a favor, you do me a favor. Like I rub your back, you rub mine. Okay, I did not rub anything! I wasn't... I had a scorecard there... Maybe you saw the outline of things, but that's all I had. That's enough, the outline is enough. Don't show that too tall ass around here again. Hey, Yaco. Salvatore! What's up? Heard about your driving incident. Yeah, yeah, it was crazy, just a dare gone wrong. Oh, Gabby dared you to flee from her house naked? How do you know? I, too, am fucking Gabby. For many years now. All the things she does with her pinky, I know all about this. As do I! No! And now you start doing the same and you almost get caught. If you get caught, suspicion falls on all the pros... At the club, does it not? Such sloppy behavior we cannot risk. No more sleeping with women. You will ruin everything. Keep your beef and the chorizo somewhere else... You can't tell me where to put my chorizo. I can. It's my chorizo... Stop giving private lessons or you are fired. You were my apostle. Little did I know, that apostle was... Judas. What? You betray me not with a kiss, but with a fuck! What the fuck? Yaco... Andiamo, Salvatore. Salvatore, you get it. No! Salvatore! Salvatore... Did you find going to public school a disadvantage... For your college application? You know, tins, honestly if you're smart enough... It doesn't really matter where you come from? Now, uh... Don't worry, I got the goods in here. Let's go. Yeah. Wow, Mit and drugs. He'll probably solve cold fusion his freshman year. Probably. I'm pretty sure you don't know lion well enough... To weigh in on what he's gonna do. Andy, what are you doing? Yeah, we're all going to college pretty soon... What do you got going? Maybe... isn't there a kangaroo helicopter... With like digeridoo blades that can come grab you... And haul you back to Australia, so you're not in my face... Every moment of the rest of the summer? You know what, Andy, I'm sure there is. But you see, kangaroo helicopters with digeridoo... Blades, they breakdown pretty easily, so... Oh, yeah, yeah, you're a funny man! I can't stand you! One... I'm just... I'm so... That's cool. I like you. 30-year-old, I'm gonna fuck with a dad? I'm speaking to you, Andy! Totally fucking unacceptable! What is wrong with you lately? I'll go apologize! That's not what I want, I want you to tell me... What is going on right now! There's three weeks left of summer... And I don't want to share that time with "airland." Well, his name is Erland. Whatever. And he's not even around that much. He's around whenever you're around. He's my boyfriend. Right. Whoa, why are you like trying to ruin this for me? I'm not trying! Why are you... Why did you do... Dude, what did I do, just tell me what I did, what did I do? You got a guy and you're all lovey dovey... You're just some type of person you never were before! Whoa, so you're... You're blossoming right now... And you're not supposed to blossom right now. I'm sorry, but it should be us together! Um... okay. I had no clue that you felt this way. How do you feel this way about me? I don't know, I don't know, I don't... I just do. That would be really weird. No, it wouldn't. Yeah, yes, it would. It doesn't have to be. Yeah, no, how about this. Whoa, whoa! See, that's what I'm trying to tell you. Stop... Come here, let me show you something else. Come here. Can you come closer? I want you to fuck me. What? I want you to fuck me. Stop! Okay, then why don't you try? You say something dirty to me. Try. F... finger me. No... finger you. Okay, all right. You... I will... That's exactly, hmm. So... Okay, okay, okay. We know each other too well. You've proven your point. I feel so weird. I'm sor... I'm sorry? Whatever, like there's a beach full of girls... That think you're really cool, for whatever reason... And only I know the truth, so let's just... I forgot already. Didn't happen, and it's never gonna happen. So, let's just forget about it. Hold on. What, who is it? Private tennis lesson, I'm on call. What do you mean, you're gonna go do a private tennis lesson... When you're... you've been drinking! I agree, it isn't entirely professional. Does this have something to do... With why you've been driving around naked? You whore! So, the lion has gone full-blown crazy. Yeah, he taught me the quivering hand technique... With his palm, you know? The touch of death? Yeah, the touch of death. Seems irresponsible. I mean, he was high when he told me. No, no, what are you doing, what are you doing? Watch that thing, easy does it! Pardon me, man. Hey, airland! Let's have a chat. I am sorry about earlier. You're an ass, Andy. Maybe I have been recently, but if you hurt her... I will kill you. Okay. Come on. Nailed it. I don't think he's coming back, either. Hello? Hi, Diana. You know what? Private lessons are over. Okay... they're back on and I will be there in 20 minutes. Thank you. No, no, what? I'm sorry, a client just offered me a thousand dollars for a lesson. A lesson? A client? Dude, you don't even have your tennis racket with you... Listen to yourself. What the hell's happening with my friends this summer? It's like I'm the only one that's being me. That's me. Last one and I'm out. Okay, so, one last big gig before retirement? That's real mature, I'm sure that's what they all say. What are you doing? Dude! Diana! Diana? Hello? Diana? Andy? Huh? What? Conch, what are you doing? What you... babysitting. Someone let you babysit? What the hell's that supposed to mean? Wait, I've never seen you sober. You think I do my job drunk? That's messed up, man. Hey, get in here. Sit, sit, sit. Hey, so, what are you doing here? I was at a party. Yeah? And I'm looking for a Diana. You mean, Ms. Bradfield? Yeah, she lives next door. Oh. Weird person to be looking for in your current state. Ah! Seriously? Yo, this is Andy, we went to high school together. Hello, child. So, can't believe you were at a party. You never came to our parties. He, we never, we were never invited to his parties. Nobody's ever invited, they just show up. That's what a party is. That doesn't really... Really apply to us, though. Are you stupid? Because nobody ever disliked you guys. You guys are the ones who stayed away. You exiled yourselves. Hard truths. Anyway, shake it off, listen. You should come to the summer dump party. Yeah, and I know how important it is for you to feel special... So, you can be my honored guests. Summer dump? I would love that. When is it? Same time every year. Last weekend in August. Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get back to babysitting. Okay? I'm sure Diana is waiting for you. Ooh, bro, you should have taken her to prom! Seriously, given her age, she could've chaperoned... And been your date. Come on, Andy, think about these things. Conch. Yeah? Dude, you're my friend now. Bye! Send. Punch... throw a kick, punch. What is going... What? Keep busy, guys, just keep doing your thing, man. Punch! Oh, man. She's 18... yes, 18. Of course, you're not a replacement. I want you in my bed... And this weekend will be perfect, yeah. Really? Fuck. Hey, Andy, looking good. Hey! No, you look good, you do! Sit down! No, no! We told you, Andy, no more sex! Gabby's husband called asking if either of us... Had lost a headband, which he found in his bedroom. Aw, that's where that one went. Ow! Okay, okay, easy, easy. Look, look, let's form an alliance together, let's work... Ow! Shh. Such sloppiness has no place at the pro shop. You're fired. And if anyone else comes sniffing around here... Looking for the man who's been with their wives... I will give them your name. You flew too close to the sun. Judas... The pussy sun. Salvatore... No, Andy, not today! I called Yaco about it, he swore up and down it wasn't his. It's a fact, Yaco isn't into women. He'd never touch your wife. She's not into Italians... So, Salavatore is out. Did you ask her about Andy? The high school kid? No. Why? Because when Victoria had too much... To drink the other night, she told me she slept with him. I'll talk to the other guys, see what they know about it. Thanks. What happened this morning, guys? Oh, nothing, lion and I lost our jobs... And Nora found out Erland is sleeping with somebody else, so- who knew that peyote would stay in my system for three days? God, I'm so stupid to cut it that close, man. Easy. Guys, I'm done with drugs and alcohol. Okay, a warrior needs his mind to be sharp. At least the summer's almost over, so... Almost... we got invited to summer dump. Oh, my god! Are you serious? No way. You're not... You guys don't' want to... You wanna go? No, no, I mean, I'm exhausted, you guys. I vote that we just cut our losses. No! Our group has been disintegrating this summer. You two have been fighting each other, you fried your brain... And I've... I mean, not much has happened for me, I realize that. It probably should have by now and I'm not too happy... With my progression, either, but... This is the last time we're gonna be together like this... So, we're going to summer dump! Okay. Sorry. Some weird number. Hello? Danya Andy? It's Danya. Danya? Hi! Danya I'm at the shuttle bus stop in Hyannis. I got a transfer from Boston. You're at the shuttle bus stop? Danya you got my emails I was coming, right? Oh, you didn't check your spam folder, did you? Your email? Of course, I got your emails. I'm gonna come get you, I'm gonna come right now. I'll be there in ten minutes. Danya okay, Andy, I'm excited. Me, too, me, too! Okay, bye. So, Danya is real and she is here and I'm gonna go get her. She just like showed up out of the blue? Indians are spontaneous like that. Gandhi was pretty patient. Shut up. You know I'm coming, right, I have to see this. Yeah, no, me, too, because I can't go back to the lab, so. I have work, so I'll be staying here. Good, yes, all of you stay here... Because you'll freak her out if you come. Oh, the Internet is awesome. Okay. Hi! This is... Oh, that's nice. Oh, my god. Ah, she sees me. Who are those people? Oh, they came with the car. You can't understand anything about the world... If you don't read Amartya sen's "inequality re-examined." Okay, but I read, "development as freedom." That's just an appetizer for "inequality re-examined." You'll have to feed me dinner. Hey, have you ever read, intuition... Lion! Sorry. Okay... Um, that should... That should cover it. Thank you. Oh. Oh, yes. Where did you get so much cash to pay for this place? I'm a sperm donor. You must be exhausted. I am so glad you're here. Me, too. Um, I have to go in there all of a sudden... But I'm gonna come back here and then, we're just... We're just never leaving. Okay? Okay. All right, I'll be right back. Ow! Oh, god, fire. Hot, hot burn. Oh, my god! Something is wrong... Something is wrong. Okay, so... I have to go now, I have to go do something. You're leaving? It's nothing weird, I just gotta go. Okay? I'll be back, I'll be back. Looks like you have a yeast infection. A yeast infection? Men get yeast infections, too. Particularly if you're having a lot of intercourse... And your immune system is suppressed... Which would be the case... If you've been drinking a lot of alcohol. Oh, my god. Lucky for you, it's curable with a seven-day course of treatment. Any way we could speed that up? Some women have success putting non-sweetened probiotic yogurt.. Directly on the infection. Nope. No, no, no. This can't be happening... I've been very careful. You've been having a lot of sex, Andy. I know. Lay off sex for the next week and you'll be fine. Lay off for the next week? I can't. Yes, you can... okay? I gotta... can I pay for this visit in cash? I don't want my parents to see my insurance bill. It's a paper trail thing. You've had sex with 15 women in the past two months... And you carry that kind of cash? Yes. Who are you? I don't even know anymore. And you're certain, she's not a spy sent to kill you... Or some shit, bro? Going for a walk. Andy, Andy come in! I can't hear you. What? You can absolutely hear her, bro. Can't hear you, either. I'm just craving it right now. I don't even... If you wanna know one thing about me... It's that I love yogurt. Oh, yeah, you know, that's the one. That's the one, I love this stuff. This is gonna do the trick. No... fuck it. Ah, yes. Oh, my gosh, my stomach is killing me from those clams. Hey, where have you been? Been calling you. I've been looking for your dick under this microscope. Um, what? I, uh, I heard you, heard you talking to a girl on the phone.. The other day about how I was 18 and you could use a replacement? I believe that's how you put it. Does that ring any bells? So you just fuck off! This is it. Alcohol's in here, right? Identify yourselves. Uh... Andy, spice, lion and Nora. Who's the hot girl? Nora. And... Danya! Danya, also. Holy shit! It's the smart kids! And have you come for precious metals... For your space laboratories? We came to hang out! You heard them! They wanna hang... And they have extra brain cells. Find them and destroy them! Whoo! Conch! Hell, yeah, this is gonna be... This is Danya, this is Danya. No shit, how you doing? She's from India. She came from India. You got hot! Thank you. You used to not be hot. I know. But now you're hot. Thank you, thank you. Hot. Woo! Goddamn, the palate on that is wrong, it's so wrong. Let's see. This will fuck people up. What are you doing with that punch? I'm improving it. Here. Try it. It's great. Huh? Andy Evans! Recipient of the role of distinction award. Being this is your first summer dump... This is your initiation! Foam mattress wrestling! I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that, uh-uh. The role of distinction award is given to the student... That best exemplifies the principles... Of academic excellence... Loyalty and service to the rest of the class. Ring girls, prepare him. To demonstrate those principles... Your champion, Andy will be wrestling... Plymouth rock! Do you think you're smart? What? I said, do... you... Think... you're... smart? Not anymore, I don't. Oh, no! Let go! Come on, Andy! Come on! Okay, put him down! Put him down! Get up... get the fuck up... get the fuck up! Andy! Andy! Andy, Andy! Sorry, my hands are chapped. It's... I do yardwork. It's just... keep going, keep going. You're doing me next, you know. Release! Hey, lion. You okay? I came from India thinking it was going to be this... Romantic trip, but... I don't think Andy even likes me. I've been here a week and he hasn't touched me. He hasn't touched you? But you're so beautiful. I mean you're like Krishna's bride, Bhadra. You wanna go somewhere and talk about this? Aren't we talking about it somewhere now? I mean, yeah, but there are other somewheres. What is it? Thought I sensed something... Fuck it. My body gets so hot. Tell the story. I have zero muscles, I have zero muscles. Epic, man. Dude, thank you, thank you. What? Hi, mom. Mrs. Evans Andy, where are you? I'm watching a movie. Time to eat your own dick, Andy. I have to go. I love you. I know you know that, but I need to express... It to you right now, verbally, before I die. No guy has ever said that to me verbally, before death. How could anybody not love you? Hey, Andy! All right, all right, all right, I'll be honest. I have conflicting thoughts about what has happened over... The last couple months and I am sorry. And if I were you guys, I would be just as mad. I fucked your wives, for god's sake. But I got a yeast infection, that sucks... it really sucks. Also, which one of you is Gabby's husband? Gabby, now, Gabby does this thing with her pinky, right? That hurts a lot, feels good, but it hurts so much... And I've had to ice most days of the summer. I just want to say that also. So, I am a victim here as well... right? You're an idiot. This has nothing to do with you! Lion, you sure you wanna do this? Fuck, yeah, bro, it's a totally justifiable use of force. In a mob, you gotta use the low Thai kicks. Lion! This is about my wife. I'm sorry, bro... This is about my friend. Oh, my god! Fuck yeah! You're amazing! I got you! I love you! We did it! I actually love you! Holy shit! What the fuck! Oh, my god! Holy shit! They're dead. I think they're all dead! Oh, my. Hey, guys. What'd I miss? Uh, I mean... I don't even know where to start. It's been the longest night, I think we gotta call it. Okay, I'm chillin'. Why do you seem so relaxed? You know what, I'm just feeling refreshed, you know? Release? I've been released. Oh, man! Congratulations. It's your moment. I'm so proud of you. Hey! Don't hide it, I already saw it, why would you hide it? Where would you hide it? Wearing a sock as a shirt... What the hell? Who did this? I did, sir. They deserve it? They were trying to kill Andy. Too tall. You remember me? Absolutely. Got my mortgage situation fixed. That means you got your arrest fixed. Really? Mm-hm. Come on with it. Hey, thank you, thank you. I was drinking a beer... Looks like there's nothing to see out here. Right? You kids want a ride? In a cop car? That would be awesome. Let's go. Okay... Absolutely. Can you put on the sirens? Yes! Legend! Reach out and get that. Yep... that's it. Thanks, guys. Hey, good luck at college, Andy. Appreciate it. Mom... breathe. I'm okay. The last few days... I've never experienced anything like it. I had no idea those positions had a use outside of karate. Visit me as soon as you can. Let's shoot for winter break. I'm planning on being a millionaire near the end... Of the first semester anyway, so, we'll go somewhere nice. They're actually pretty cute. Bye, Andy, good luck at university! Thank you! Bye, Danya! Good luck at UCLA. You're an ass! Do you know how much it cost me... To fly her over here and then you end up with her? As the Japanese proverb goes... "Nokorimono Ni wa fuku Ga aru." What does that mean? "Luck exists in the leftovers." What? Yep. It's not fun. Hey, thanks for saving my life. Come on, bro, you would have done the same for me. Love you. Love you, man. Was a kick-ass summer, guys. Yeah, kinda sucks, though, I'm gonna miss you guys a lot. I'm gonna miss you guys, too. And it does suck but... We're gonna be okay. You better make people call you spice at Stanford. I don't know, man, I think I'm gonna kick it off with, Mike. Mike? See where it evolves from there. What's wrong with that? Hey! See you, guys. Bye. Hey, I miss you guys already! Love you! Ow! Next time, I'm gonna see you... You're gonna have a Dartmouth meathead beer gut. Next time I see you, you'll be pregnant by a Kennedy. Cool, we'll just hang around admiring each other's bellies. Love it. Perfect. Don't make any new friends at school, please. Okay... you, either. Deal. I love you, too. I just didn't say it at that weird, evil steel mill. You know, it was a bad setting. Hey, Andy, heads up! Hey, Tinsley. Hey. Nicely done. Automatic. Thanks. I'm Andy. Hey.
