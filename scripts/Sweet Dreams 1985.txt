You said you wanted to go to this dance. I do want to go to the dance. I just didn't think... Hi, Charlie. Nice parking job. This is gonna cost me $2.00. Hi. Hello. You're looking pretty. Thank you. You look nice yourself. Look who's here! Your favorite from the Rainbow Road, Miss Patsy Cline. Howdy. You all havin' a good time? Yeah! This is a Bob Wills' tune that I picked special just to sing to you. Deep within my heart lies a melody A song of old San Antone Where in dreams I live with a memory Beneath the stars all alone Well, it was there I found Beside the Alamo Enchantment strange as the blue up above On that moonlit pass that only he would know Still hears my broken song of love That's Cline? Patsy Cline. Right. Why don't I know her? Damned if I know. She sings at the Rainbow Road? On weekends, yeah. Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart Thanks for bringing me, Charlie. Speak once again Of my love, my own Broken song Empty words I know Shall live in my heart all alone For that moonlit pass She went to school with my brother. They used to say, " Don't dare Patsy if you don't want it done." And Rose, my Rose of San Antone She's got real nice tits. And she's married, Bozo. You lose. Thank you. Stop it! You're such a geek! Hi. Hi. I want you to get your coat. I wanna drive you someplace for a drink. I want us to dance a while. Then I want us to get to know each other a lot better. You want a lot, don't you? Yeah, I do, baby. Well, people in hell want ice water. That don't mean they get it. Patsy, you never did. I did so. I looked him right in the eye and said... "People in hell want ice water. That don't mean they get it." Who was he? Some clown with hot britches. Lord, I do get tired of men sometimes, always pawin' and snortin' around. They after you all the time when you were my age? I don't know. Were they, Mama? Tell me. Stop it. Quit, Patsy. Back when I was in high school and had a better shape... there was this boy named Teddy Welloff. Had gray eyes with coal black eyelashes. This is way before I met your daddy. May he rot in hell. Don't speak like that about Daddy. Anyway, at lunch we'd all go in the cloakroom to get our dinner buckets. Every day this Teddy Welloff used to brush his front up against me... when I was bent over. That's the truth. Wait, there's more. One day, I took my ink pen with me. That thing had a real sharp point on it. I never looked at him the rest of the day... but there was egg salad sandwich all over that cloakroom. That boy walked funny for a week. I'm gonna pee my pants. You gonna come in for a while? Is Gerald still up? It looks like it. No, honey, I better go on home. You chicken! I'll be over for Sunday dinner. Bye. Nightynight. Good night, baby. I'm home. How'd it go? Well, I only made $25. I did real good I think. That's nice. I sang "San Antonio Rose." I've been gone all evening. Don't you want to talk to me? Say "Kiss my ass" or something? Sorry, honey. How'd it go tonight? You already asked me that. Ask me something else? Come on, let's have a conversation. Notice anything different? I finished the riggin'. Patsy, why are you always pushing at me so hard? I don't know. Just hoping for a fight, or a laugh or something. I don't want to fight with you. I'm not mad. I can't stand it. Makes me want to scream and claw my face. What should I do? You didn't ask me how to get into this marriage. I don't think you ought to ask me how to get out of it. Is he mean to you? No. Does he drink? Gamble? Does he chase the women? Then what? Come on, girl. Speak the truth and shame the devil. God as my witness, I don't know! I laid in bed and thought, " Shit! What if I was blind or didn't have my legs?" You watch that mouth. Mom, I'm home. I'm starvin'. There's lunch made, but don't spoil your dinner. Say hello to your sister before you worry about your belly. I don't know, Mama. My life ain't so bad. I got a decent house, a man who loves me. I've even sung on television four times. Tell me. Why do I have to force myself to get out of bed every mornin'? You always was hard to keep satisfied, even when you was little. I'm not talking about when I was three. I'm asking you what I should do now. Maybe you should scream and claw your face. See if that'll help. I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on ashinin' Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue Blue moon of Kentucky keep on ashinin' Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue It was on one moonlit night Stars shining bright Whispered on high Love said goodbye I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on ashinin' Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue Thank you. Goddamn woman, you're good! That bitch can sing! I don't know if you remember me. Take a walk. I really like the way you sing. What were you doing while I sang? You think that's funny? I was listening. I don't like the way you listen. Take a walk. Hi. Oh, merciful God. I want to explain. It's the creature that wouldn't die. I came over here to explain. He won't go away. To apologize for messin' you up. I was just enjoying your singin'. Now that I get a good look at Patsy Cline, she don't look so hot. I don't care if you have sung on some halfassed television program. You don't sing that good. You ever listen to a Kitty Wells record real close? You'd go home and slit your goddamn throat. I've grown so used to that man somehow And I'm nobody's sugar baby now 'Cause I'm lonesome I got the lovesick blues We're gonna take a break. Thank you. Seven and seven. Last week at the high school you said you wanted to buy me a drink. I want a seven and seven. A seventyseven. Well, you've got the advantage on me. You know my name, but I don't know yours. Charlie. Charlie Dick. Dick? Charlie Dick? That's right. What do you want out of me, Charlie? You didn't follow me out to Rainbow Road because you're a fool for music. Hell no. I want to get to know you better. Okay. What does that mean? It means I want to get to know you better. I figure when you say you want to get to know me better... what you mean is you want a tenminute screw in the backseat of your car. Son of a bitch. You must think that thing you got between your legs is lined with gold. I can get tail anytime. I don't have to crawl after a mean woman who's got a cob crossways. If I just want to bump uglies with somebody, I got plenty of places to go. "Bump uglies"? That's right. My Lord, what a charming expression. I just grew up. My daddy dumped us when I was about 16. I haven't seen him since. But Mom and I did okay. She couldn't work too much, so I've worked pretty steady since I was 15. You made a livin' for the whole family? No. Mama sewed for people. But basically I did. I want to ask you something. What? You know all those things you said you want? Yeah. Answer me quick. Which you want most? All of it. I want it all. And I want to make it right. I do. Since I've been 11 or 12 years old, I've had my life mapped out. I haven't pushed hard these last years, but I'm gonna start next year. I'm starting next year, too, by God. That's the time to start for me. I'm serious. I'm gonna be a singer. I'm gonna make some money, have some kids... and then I'm gonna stop singing and raise those kids right. Have a big house with yellow roses all around it. You think that's silly? No. I figure somebody ought to be happy. Hell. It might as well be me. Right? Right. I've never met a woman like you. I can talk to you. You know what that means to a man? Do you? I don't know. Let's go dancin'. Where? Right out here. Come on. In the parking lot? Yep. Are you kiddin'? I don't do this. You don't? No. But I'm doin' it. No, Charlie, don't leave me. I was starving, and I didn't even know. Hey, Mama! Mama, come here. What are you doing here on Sunday morning? Mama, I feel so good! Don't give me that dark look. I feel so damn good! What's them suitcases? I left him. I don't care! There's a man. No, I'm doing this for me. There's a man. Mama! Honey baby! Come on, honey. Be happy for me. Does Gerald know? I stopped by on my way over here and told him. You know what he said? What? "Patsy, if your considered opinion is that you really want a divorce... I'll not stand in your way." There's a man. You're too happy. Yes, there is. I don't know. There might be. I don't know, but oh, sweet Jesus, I just feel so good. Oh, my darling, you're crying Boohoohoohoo There's no use in denying I've cried for you It was your favorite pastime Making me blue Last week was the last time I cried for you Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears Seven letters too I filled with my fears Guess it never pays To make your lover blue Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you Oh, my darling, you're crying Boohoohoohoo Your cheating heart Will make you weep You'll cry and cry And try to sleep But sleep won't come The whole night through Your cheating heart Will tell on you When tears come down Like falling rain You'll toss around Nice day. Great day. Do you want to top me all the time? Just say, "Yes, it's a nice day." Yes, it's a nice day. This water is cold. We used to come swimmin' here up till November. I'm telling you, this water's got ice cubes in it. A guy in my class says he saw an with his mouth open, showing white. I ain't afraid of snakes. Take a swim, big talk. Go ahead. I'll pay you. How much will it take for you to jump in? What? I'm serious. How much? Three hundred. You'd really do it? You got the cash? I love it! Man, I wish I had $300. You don't have it? I ain't jumping in for nothin'. I'll save you. You want to have other nice days like today? Sure. I mean lots of them. Sure. No, I mean lots of them. Good times all the time, Sunday to Sunday. What? Charlie? Wanna get married? I dare you! Yes! You telling me yes? Yes! Beautiful. Doesn't she look beautiful? Are you ready? We're ready. Byebye. If you find yourself wondering what to do in the dark, give me a call. I think I can manage. I'll see you at work. On Monday morning. Byebye, Mama. I love you, sugar. You take care of yourself. You look so pretty today. Bye. What the hell you been doing in there? Come here. It's kind of scary, isn't it? What do you mean? You go out and buy a new dress... stand in front of a preacher, say a few words... suddenly everything's changed. I just want it to work out, Charlie. I want everything to be right. Well, come here. Wait. This is my wedding night. I want the words. Say the words. I love you. Say it again. I love you, goddamn it! That's so nice. I want this to work out, too. I'm sure as hell gonna try. Yeah? Yeah. Here. You look like you need this more than me. God bless you, mister. Big night, huh? Real big. Tell me. How was the honeymoon? Nice? Hell, yeah. It was wonderful. Two days at a cutrate motel. It was great. Real uptown stuff. Pasty didn't like it? Patsy didn't say a word. She wouldn't. I didn't like it. I didn't like it. Jesus, you're in a mood. I've got $12 to my name. Twelve dollars until payday. The money ain't so bad here. Or so good. What do you want? Want to be like that old fart, Lawrence? Wear a suit, run the place? Hell, no. I'd just like somethin' different maybe. Do something a little better. I'd like to get my own place maybe. I don't care, I ain't gonna do it. The idea of you asking me to go on television and lie. I am not asking you to lie. All you've got to do is say, "Mr. Godfrey, I'm Hilda Hensley. I brought my friend Patsy Cline. I'm her talent scout." That's not a lie. You are my friend. I ain't gonna do it, so stop flapping your jaws at me. That man from the show told you that talent scouts can't be a relative. Is that why you give me that housecoat of yours with the puff sleeves? I give you that housecoat 'cause you said you liked it. Well, I won't lie on television. Goddamn it! I'm not asking you to lie. Just don't spill your guts is all I'm askin'. Stop that dirty talk now. Mama, think of what it could mean to sing on national television. All you gotta do is just say... "Mr. Godfrey, I'm Hilda Hensley. I've brought my friend Patsy Cline. I'm her talent scout." Come on, Mama. Do I have to get on my knees and beg you? I will. Please! Help me to be a singer, have my house with the yellow roses. Please! That house with the yellow roses! I'm sick of hearing about it. What does Charlie say about all this? He thinks it's a terrific idea. Well, I ain't gonna do it. The idea of me on television. Thirty seconds. They're from Winchester, Virginia. Patsy, I can't do it. You can, too. Don't be an old chicken. You look beautiful. A little color in your cheeks. Mrs. Hensley? You're on. Follow me. Just say what we practiced. Say what we practiced and smile. You look real pretty. You're better looking than her, Woodhouse. Get her off of there. Let's see Patsy. Marla Kleinman. Remember, folks. Your applause is on the applause meter. Get lost! Stop it. Hello and welcome. There's your mama! That is a pretty dress. What color is that exactly? Mr. Godfrey, I'm Hilda Hensley. And I brought my friend Patsy Cline. And I'm her talent scout. Good. Miss Cline, let's go. Hurry please, around the back. Where are you from? Winchester, Virginia. That's lovely country. So, what's Patsy's talent? She sings. Does she sing better than I do? Oh. Well, she's... She's wonderful. She made a record. Why don't we bring her out? Ladies and gentlemen... let's welcome Patsy Cline. Come on, Patsy! Come on, baby! I go out walkin' after midnight Out in the moonlight just like we used to do I'm always walkin' after midnight Searchin' for you She looks great, don't she? I walk for miles along the highway Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you I'm always walkin' after midnight Searchin' for you That's beautiful. I stopped to see a weepin' willow cryin' on his pillow Maybe he's cryin' for me You lucky boy. She could make it big. Night winds whisper to me I'm lonesome as I can be She's singing good. I go out walkin' after midnight Out in the moonlight just hopin' you may be Somewhere out walkin' after midnight Searchin' for me Patsy Cline! This Virginia gal can sing. Let us hear from you through the applause meter. Watch the meter. Come on, people, clap louder. Go, go! Patsy Cline is the winner! She won! Bull's eye! A little draggy to me that time. Patsy, that's all right. This is gonna make us all a whole lot of money, little girl. Listen, boys, you don't mind if we try it one... Come on. One more time. Thanks a lot, boys. I'm home, baby. Where've you been? I stopped and had a drink. Yeah. Five or seven. I worked my hump off making you baked chicken, you come home this late. I'll eat it. You got a finger? Then put it in a telephone and dial when you'll be late. I said I'd eat the thing. Lady, I've got a message for you. Screw your baked chicken and screw you. Yeah? That's the last time I'm gonna make you something nice. Oh, poor Patsy. You dumb son of a bitch! You want your dinner? Why don't you eat it now? Gonna throw a plate? You wanna start on the living room? Charlie, look what you've done! Goddamn it! Sip it slow and the world stays sweet. My daddy used to say that same thing. Do my back, baby, would you please? He was something, my old man. He used to eat cold navy bean sandwiches for breakfast every morning. I hope he rots in hell. What do you mean? He's crazy. He tried some stuff with me once. You telling me he tried to mess with you? I don't want to talk about that now. How come you never told me about that? How come you never say anything about your family? Not when I'm in such a good mood. Hello? Patsy Cline? That's me. What? Who is it? Is it Woodhouse? Hush up. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. Tell him he made me late for dinner. For the love of God, put a lid on it. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, my husband's a little nuts. This is Decca Records. What? That's Decca Records. " Walkin' after Midnight" jumped to number 16! I am on the son of a bitchin' charts! Goddamn it, baby! Let's go spend some money. I got a letter from Washington. Probably from Eisenhower, wanting to know why I didn't vote for him. Shit! I've been drafted. What? They want me to show up next week. I can't be drafted. I'm in the National Guard. You said they never miss you at those meetings. Well, I ain't goin', I'll tell you that much. I'll shoot my toe off. I'll tell 'em I'm a homo. I ain't goin'! I love you. Take care of yourself. Bye, baby. Well, now, it ain't the end of the world. Fort Bragg's not exactly a million miles away. You've got that tour coming up. Shit! Why don't you tell me every cloud's got a silver linin'? Why don't you move in with me, honey? No sense in paying rent on your place. Well, good mornin'. Says who? For heaven's sake. Sit up and take some nourishment. Charlie'll have his first leave in three weeks... and you walk around with your lower lip draggin' the floor. Big bawlin' baby. I oughta fix you a sugar tit. You're still not too big for me to smack your jaws for you. You know that? You make that sign again, I'll leave the print of my hand across your face. I'll make your teeth rattle. For those of you who've got to get to work, it's 8:30 in the morning. Let's continue listening to everybody's favorites. I got a check today. Why don't you go out and spend some money? It'll make you feel better. Says who? You're just too mean to live lately. Well, what do you think? I think it's beautiful. I think I hate it. You sour, mean thing. But I know how to get sweet again. I'm lookin' for Charlie Dick of the 20th Battalion. Go down here and turn left. Can you tell me where "C" Company is? Right over there. There? Thank you. You're welcome. Charlie! Hey, baby. How are ya? What'd they do to your hair? They cut it. Eat your hearts out! Come on, honey. Hurry up, get the key in there. I was waitin' to see you. Wait, Charlie. I gotta close the window. Hurry up. You know something, Charlie? You can't go to your grave saying you weren't ever loved. 'Cause no matter what happens to you for the rest of your life... right now, by God, somebody loves you. Totally. Come on home and fool around with me So, honey, fool around You'll know right where I'm at And don't worry if I'm lonesome 'cause I'm used to that And when you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three Then come on home and fool around with me Won't you come home, Bill Bailey Won't you come home I'm home the whole day long I'll do the cookin', honey I'll pay the rent I know I've done you wrong Remember that rainy evenin' I drove you out With nothin' but a fine tooth comb Take it home. I know that I'm to blame And ain't that a shame Bill Bailey, won't you please come home Come home, Bill Bailey Bill Bailey, won't you please come home Lord, I'm give out. I'm so tired, my ass is draggin' the floor behind me. I'm so tired, I wished I was dead. I'm so tired, I wished I'd never been born. I'm so tired, I wished my daddy'd had his thing cut off so he never... God Almighty! Will you boys let it be? Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms Gonna lay around this shack Till the milk train comes back Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms I ain't gonna work on the railroad I ain't gonna work on the farm Gonna lay around this shack till the milk train comes back Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms Patsy? Are you okay? Darling, tell those boys they'll have to wait. I can't get up. How about it? You gonna live? Oh, Lord, I've been better. Let me have a sip of this. You have to do that in the mornin'? It puts hair on your head. Oh, my God in heaven! I bet I'm pregnant. Lord, I can't be pregnant. I just had a hit record. My husband's in the army. I mean, oh, Lord. How the hell am I gonna tour if I'm pregnant? Oh, God. You talk about your bad timin'. Please, Fred, don't eat that. Hi, honey. Charlie. Look at me, honey. You think I look just awful? Hell, no. You look great, baby. You always do. Thanks. I'm crazy 'bout you, baby. I love you all the time. Come here. You sure you want to? Look out. I'm comin' to get you. Ah, baby. You still like me, Charlie? Yeah. You do? Lord, bitch. You don't sing. You whine. Whine. Hi, darlin'. What are you doin'? Havin' a glass of champagne with Kirk Douglas. What's it look like I'm doin'? You don't have to iron me a shirt every day. I thought you told me Sergeant Wilson wanted you lookin' sharp. I'll tell you a secret. I don't give a goddamn what Sergeant Wilson says. That tight assed bastard's been on my back ever since I got here. God, I hate this army. I hate this state. I hate this miserable little apartment. I've been places I like better, too. I could still be making records if I'd stayed home. Nobody asked you to come here. The hell you didn't. You begged me. I didn't mean it. Come on, Charlie. Don't fuss now. I'm makin' chili for dinner. You like that. Let's just be nice. Oh, my. "I'm makin' chili, and I try to be nice... but my husband's just so rude and nasty." Shut up. Poor Patsy! Why don't you just shut your mouth? Why don't you try and make me? Don't push me, Charlie. I dare you. Patsy. Patsy! Leave me alone! You know the part I remember? I remember the part when you told me over and over... how you're gonna protect me. Keep anybody from hurtin' me. You remember all those times you told me that? Patsy, wait! Patsy, I'm sorry. Open the door up. I'll bring the rest. Will you get the baby things, John? I'm gonna start singin' again right after the baby's born. I was hopin' you'd stay home for a while. I'm gonna start singin' the same week the baby's born. I can make it, Mama. Damn it, I know I can. All I need is one good song to put me over the top. Then when I've made enough, I can retire, raise the baby. I just wanna make it right. You forgot the part about the yellow roses. What the livin' hell? They told me... It's a false alarm. Why don't you put a star in your crown, and get old Charlie a beer? Can I have a kiss? Can I have a decent kiss? Miss me? Nope. I didn't know it till I saw you, but, yes, I did. Look at you. I got ten days' leave. I got two good lookin' women, and a baby on the way! Hog heaven! Mama, look at these sweet little things Betty just gave me. Aren't they darlin'? Look at that one. It's got a little bit of embroidery. Damn it! Get your feet off the baby's clothes. Charlie, for the love of God! Why don't you get out from under our feet? Go buy yourself a beer or something. Lord. All right, if that's what you think I should do. Dinner's at 6:00. All right. Charlie here says he loves the army. Hell, yes. Says he's gonna reenlist when his time's up. You know, Woodhouse, I never saw so many teeth in a horse's ass. I gotta go. You butthole. Come on. I didn't know they made apron strings this long. I gotta get home. Let's stop and have one. It's on the way. Just a quick one. Hey, bartender, let us have a shot for everybody. No, not for me. Nothing but the best for Charlie. Yes, one more. One more. Just one before you go. No, I gotta get goin'. Y'all have a good night. It's been real nice. I'll see you before I go. Hey, Charlie. What? Nothin'. What? Well, your hair is all. You look so different with short hair. So? So, I think it's kind of cute. I like it. Remember? All those good times we had. Yeah, I remember. Of course I remember. Well, why do you have to go home so early then? Talk to me, Charlie. You know I've always liked you. We're goin' to Carol's house. Come on, Charlie. Let's get outta here. Is the father around so I can get the rest of this information from him? Well, what's his name? Charles Dick. Son of a bitch! Stop that dirty talk now. He'll be here soon. The son of a bitch! Oh, Mama. Somebody answer the phone. Hello. Charlie? Where are you? Charlie, we're at the hospital. She's had her baby. I'll be right down. No, you won't be right down. You keep your miserable self away. She had a hard time. She's finally asleep. She asked for you 14 times tonight, and you weren't there. Damn your soul, Charlie Dick. Where were you? There's your dad. Hi, honey. She's beautiful. You want to hold her? Yeah. Come here, you little thing. I got her. I got ya. She's so pretty. Look at her hair. I know. It's curlin' already. You still think Julie's a good name for her? I wish to God I'd been with you. Yeah. Where were you? I'd tell you a hundred lies, but I ain't goin' to. Got drunk. That's whiskey under the bridge. Fifty cents, please. Yes, ma'am. Hello? Hi, baby, it's me. Hi, Charlie. Guess what? I found us a new apartment. It's got room for the baby... and it's still cheaper than that other one we had down here. Got a big kitchen, too. So, what do you say? Why don't you come on down? No, Charlie, I can't. I want to start singin' again, and Mama helps me with Julie. Come on, baby. I really miss ya. I wanna see my kid. Don't you get another leave in a couple of months? You can see her then. Goddamn. Why are you so polite anymore? Can't you just talk normal? I feel like I'm talkin' to Eleanor Roosevelt. I gotta go, Charlie. The baby's cryin'. I'll talk to you, okay? Yeah, okay, if Julie's cryin'. Patsy. You awake? Wake up, baby. Shh. Put something on. I want to take you someplace. What's the matter? What are you doing here? It's important. You crazy? It's the middle of night! I can't leave the baby. We'll put her with Hilda. Why won't you tell me what this is about? Just wait. At least tell me where we're going. I need something from you. I need you to look me in the face and say... "You screw up a lot, but I still love you, Charlie. I always will." I told you before you left, I'm not holding any grudges. I need something from you. I need you to look me in the face and say... "You screw up a lot, but I still love you, Charlie. I always will." You screw up a lot, Charlie, but I still love you and I always will. Say it again. You screw up a lot, but I still love you, Charlie. I always will. I'll have a blue Christmas Without you I'll be so blue Thinking about you Decorations of red On a green Christmas tree Start the movie! Won't mean a thing, dear, if... What are they doin'? What the hell's goin' on? I cannot believe this! Honey, your mama's life is not workin' out. Trust me. It's not. I'm goin' to Nashville tomorrow. See if I can do something. Aren't you Patsy Cline? Yeah. I'm Randy Hughes. I was just coming to see you. Is that right? You wrote me a letter about a year ago. But I had a baby and haven't been doin' much singing. You don't have to sell me. I think you're maybe the best country singer in the world. Come in here. Let's you and I talk. I always did like a man who knew how to start a conversation good. I swear, I can make us both a lot of money. You won't be sorry. You know why not? Why? Because when the song is right and I feel it... I can tell from looking at people's faces that I've reached inside them. You got any idea what that feels like? You want to be Kitty Wells? Hell no! I want to be Hank Williams. All right. Sit down, listen to me. I got a story to tell you. I heard you sing one night in a dump in Virginia. Twelve tables, watereddown drinks... dance floor the size of that coffee table. You were good. The crowd liked ya. Ate up that yodelin' and growlin' stuff. Then you let go on "Walkin' the Floor Over You." But you did it slow like a ballad. I'm tellin' you, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. There I was in this dive in Virginia... and I was listening to something real special. Yeah. You get my drift? I'll make it simple. You got a voice that was made to sing love songs. If I work with you, we take advantage of that fact. I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I got starving kids waiting in the car. It's too late. It's all set up. I don't give a damn! I don't want four big male singers drowning me out. They're booked and will be there at 2:00. If they're there, I'm not showing up. Musicians are booked. Owen Bradley's gonna be there. I'm gonna be there. You can show up or not. Just suit your damn self. I will. Grab hold of Randy, Madrine. They got four singers backing me up today. Big ones. They're just gonna drown me out. Hell's bells! Let's have the next bit. One, two. Hello. Did you tell 'em what I said? Mr. Bradley's the producer, darling. Hello, Patsy. Hi, Mr. Bradley. What's the frown for? You've been worryin' again. Don't frown. You'll make yourself old before your time. I wanted to talk to you... Listen to me. Everything's all right. The song's a good one. The arrangement's a good one. The backup singers are good. Even the glazed doughnuts are good. Everything's good today, so relax and be happy and sing! Just make sure they hear me. Sing! Take seven coming up. I can see you all recognize that song. That's great. We happen to have the little girl backstage that made that famous. We're proud of her at the Grand Old Opry. Miss Patsy Cline! I fall To pieces Each time I see you again I fall To pieces How can I be just your friend You want me to act Like we've never kissed You want me to forget Pretend we've never met And I've tried And I've tried But I haven't yet You walk by And I fall to pieces I like everything you sing. You just open your mouth and I fall down. But when you sing those slow ones... I just love it. Randy told me it's number nine on the pop charts. I'm a crossover. Money, money, money! I wanna buy Mama a pure silk dress. Give Sylvia that graduation party she never had. I want to spend some of that money. I'll tell you what. I'll help you do it. I'm home. Had to crawl part way, but I made it. That's pretty. Bake that all by your Ionesome? I sure did. How come you didn't bake me a cake for my birthday? Goddamn it! That's not funny. Been working on that all day. Didn't this pie turn out nice? Did it with tapioca just like Mama does. I can't wait to see her and John and Sylvie tomorrow. Why don't you go easy on that drinkin' tomorrow at the party? Why don't you kiss my furry butt? You think I wouldn't? Come on, Charlie. I'm cooking chicken. Stop it. Everything's gonna burn. Where are the kids at? They're upstairs in their bedroom. Come on. Oh, Lord! On the linoleum floor... with my dress up around my ears? Charlie! Red hots. Get your red hots here. Here's a taker for you. Come on now. Like New York City. Come on! Hey, everybody. Listen a minute. We have a high school graduate in our family for the very first time. Charlie and I finally got enough money... Finally! To give her a party and buy her a present. Here it is. Happy graduation. It's a new toothbrush. Don't Sylvia looks sweet today? I love her new hairdo. I'm gonna put him down. He's so crabby. Good night, honey. Give Grandma a kiss. Here, sweetheart. Put him down. Give Mama a kiss. Oh. It just kills me I don't see him more. I know it. I wrote that book. How's things with you and Charlie? Up and down? There's lots of up and down. Oh, Patsy! Geez, Mama. You know Charlie. He drinks a little, but I knew that when I married him. Other than that, things are silky smooth. When he drinks, he's got a temper. Does he hit you? Just that one time. They say if a man hits you once, there's always another time. Sis, you have some money? We want some more beer. I wanna go with you. See you in a minute. You don't remember Barbara Simmons? You had crush on her all through the fifth grade. You're a damn liar. I don't know why, though, with that frizzy brown hair. What about you and old Homer Atkinson? I never liked Homer Atkinson! You loved Homer Atkinson. I did not! You called him every night and hang up... when he answered. Look out! Somebody help me! The babies. Where are the babies? Patsy, they're fine. John's all right, too. You had us scared a little bit. Tell me. Are the babies alive? Honey, little Randy and Julie weren't with you. John was with you, and he's okay. The kids are sleeping. Good night. Relax. Just a moment. Forceps, please. Very good. That's fine. That's very good. Fine, fine. Just as we expected. It's healing nicely. Is it that bad? It's not that bad... I wanna look. When the stitches come out, the scars will heal very quickly. This is what I got to deal with? You cut your suit to fit your cloth. Later you can have plastic surgery if you want. Hell yes, I want plastic surgery. I want all I can get. Maybe you can make me look like Grace Kelly. Cut it. Cut it, please. Mr. Bradley... I don't care how many times you play that, I can't sing this man's songs. I don't know how to sing like that. Nobody wants you to. You can take it away from him. Yeah. The hell with the demo. Steal the son of a bitch. I don't understand why everything has to be so hard. How am I to do this? Just like you always do. Your way. Let the song tell the story. Crazy I'm crazy for feelin' So lonely I'm crazy I think that's a good tempo. Let's try it that way. Somebody bring me a beer. Will somebody bring the lady a beer? Then we'll go for a take. Wonderin' What in the world did I do Oh, crazy For thinkin' that my love Could hold you I'm crazy for tryin' And crazy for cryin' And I'm crazy for lovin' you Oh, God, honey, I hope you like it! It's so pretty. There. There it is. See that white one with the columns? Ain't it the truth? I fell in love with it the minute I saw it. I'd like a pale, pale blue carpet. Maybe a couple divans, make a conversation area. Honey? Look at this. We got a dishwasher. And an oven built right into the wall. I want to check a roast, all I have to do is open the door like this. No more bending over. The Queen of Sheba. Say you already bought it? I paid down on it. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to surprise you. You surprised me. The best thing we can do with our money is put it in bricks and mortar. That show went on forever last night... and every minute of it shows in my face today. I'm glad we saved "Crazy" till the end. I think it made a great encore. You love Charlie? What? You love him? Oh, come on. I couldn't get along without Charlie. How's that song go? " He may have been a headache, but he never was a bore." That's Charlie. Is that an answer? I think Charlie and I deserve each other. Looks like Charlie might be throwing you a little party. Sure does. Take care. I'll see you at the session. All right. Try and get a little sleep between now and Friday. Nightynight. Good night. Miss Patsy Cline! In person! My baby's home! We're having a party. I see. Did you see my new car? I bought an old clunker to drive in the demo derby. How are you? You know most everybody. This is Cindy. John and Sarah from work. That there's... I don't know who that is. This is Skip. He sold me that car. I'm glad to meet you. Nice to meet you. Think I'll get myself a beer. How'd it go tonight? All right. This your date, Otis? Lucky man. Yeah, goddamn it. Help yourself to food in there. Bought a bunch of Chinese. Let's us dance one. Come on. Don't be such an old wet blanket. Oh! No fair. We gotta wait for the next one. I'm going to bed. I'm so tired. That girl I was dancing with goes with that guy from the derby. Obviously you got me mixed up with someone who gives a shit. Come on. There you go. That's Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Take your book. Oh, how's my big boy? You are the most beautiful little boy. Here we go. Fell right on your butt. Take your bottle. Hey, kiddo. Hope you're rested. Otis wants us to go out after the demo derby tonight. Darling, I'm so tired, I feel like I'm walking on stumps. I gotta sing there tonight. I don't feel like walking off the stage and taking a busman's holiday. What's a busman's holiday? A guy drives a bus, he doesn't want to take a bus ride for his vacation. Hell. It's too hard to explain. I understood it. You getting awful goddamn fancy all of a sudden. Yeah? Here comes another paycheck for Charlie. Crazy Crazy for feelin' So lonely I'm crazy Crazy for feelin' so blue You didn't finish that. "And the cow jumped... Over the moon. Three little bears sittin' in their chairs." Better start gettin' ready. We got time. Not that much. "And a pair of mittens." You're not dressed yet. I get dressed faster than you. No, you don't. White? What? White. What are you talking about? Want to see if you say "black." "A quiet old lady who was whispering 'Hush."' Blue moon of Kentucky Keep on ashinin' Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue Love said goodbye I said Blue moon of Kentucky Keep on ashinin' Shinin' bright Whisperin' on high till lovers said goodbye I said blue moon Come on, baby, treat me right. I'm gonna get you! Baby, baby. Be good to me. What happened? That's not supposed to happen. I was lookin' for you. I ain't been hidin' nowhere. Wanna dance? Yeah, later. You should've seen Charlie. His clunker is still burnin'. Why don't you take a busman's holiday? Go sing another song. Sit down. Baby, let's dance. I'm gettin' thirsty. I don't know about you, Otis. I'll be right back. You want to leave? Hey, you. Bitch! What the hell you think you're doing? Same question back to you. I was just talkin' to her. Me, too. I'm just talkin' to them. How old is she anyhow? She said she's 24. Ask her how old she is counting the years she went barefoot on the farm. You got a mean mouth. I'd like to pull your tongue with a pair of pliers. I'm takin' a pee. I'm warnin' you. You set your ass down at my table. You hear? Don't you warn me! You spend the evening rubbing up against some tramp, I'll do whatever I please. You will, will you? I'll walk out with the first guy. I'd like to see you try. You just watch me. This is it right over here. I get Patsy Cline on my cycle, all she wants is coffee and a ride home. You're a real gent. Just my luck. Thanks a lot. No problem. Well, the slut's home. Came home to see the pig. Where's that guy? Had him let me off about a block away. We just talked. You're a whore. Let's not call each other names. It don't do no good. We still gotta wake up tomorrow, and look each other in the face. I ain't having no more nights when my wife goes off with another man. Don't tell me what you will or will not have. I looked at you tonight and thought, "God help you, Patsy. No matter how hard you try to make things right... goodtime Charlie keeps dragging you back down!" Don't whine about me! Where are you when the kids want oatmeal in the morning? Where are you when Julie pukes in bed? You sure ain't here! You lie! You never changed a shitty diaper in your life... between Mama, Madrine and me! That's right, I'm not here! I'm singing in every shit house between here and Kansas City... so you can wear $30 silk shirts! Yeah? Take the goddamn thing! Take it! You lay down for that guy tonight? Don't ask. I'm askin', slut. Yes, I did! I did! It was great. It was wonderful. It was better than it's been with you. We're gonna get married, Mr. Motorcycle man and me. Come here. Stand up! Stop it! Stop! Goddamn it! Shut up! Mama? Oh, God, baby, go back to bed. Regarding that family disturbance, unit 17 has that in hand. Trade me an eye for one of them cigarettes? What are you in here for? Had an argument with my wife. I fell asleep in a doorway. Put them there. You can have one whenever you want it. Thank you. I appreciate it. You look like you got the whole world on your shoulders. You give me a cigarette, these questions go with it, you can have it back. I just thought we'd pass the time. Go ahead and take it. You only got one. It's all right. I smoke too much anyway. Thank you. Sleep light, don't you? Just like my old man. He smoked Camels, too. He started when he was nine years old. There he was, nine years old, in the fourth grade... still wearing knickers. Get up in the morning, he'd have a cup of coffee and a cigarette... right at the breakfast table, big as you please. He was a pisscutter, my old man was. He always could make me laugh. I never knew who my daddy was. I don't think Mama did either. My daddy's six feet tall... when six feet tall was big. Had this real high voice. Could walk halfway around the block on his hands. One morning I was getting ready for school. My daddy stayed home from work, he was at the kitchen table smoking Camels... one right after the other, he was eatin' them. I went to get corn flakes out of the cupboard... and heard this noise. I thought the whole house was falling down. I turned around, he'd shot hisself in the head. Sweet Jesus! I sat on my bed for five days. Wouldn't talk to nobody. Wouldn't go to his funeral. On the fifth day, I got up, went out the door. And I never looked back. Just keep on movin'. Know what I mean? Just keep on movin'. I can't seem to find anything in my life to hold on to anymore. It's like everything is falling down around me. I say to myself, " I don't have to lead that trashy dog's life... that my daddy led my mama. I can make things different. I can make it right." And look at me. Here I am, my face busted up. Calling the cops in the middle of the night. And my kid saw it all! Mama, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know whether to divorce him or not. All I know is I can't keep him outta the house like this forever. This is your baby. You have to rock it. Hell! I'm not asking for your goddamn eyeteeth! I was asking for your opinion. You're talking to your mama. You keep a civil tongue in your head. Yeah? Oh, no, Randy, not a big show! All right. Christ on the cross! I don't believe it. I got recording sessions Friday. Now I gotta do a benefit for that disc jockey that died last month. Tell him you're wore out. I'm sorry I snapped at you. If that's the worst thing that ever happens to me. You still like me? Now and then. You love me? Sometimes. Tell me what to do with my life. I've got your picture That you gave to me And it's signed "With love" Just like it used to be Hey! Whoa! Charlie. Where are you goin'? I'm gonna talk to my wife. Hold on a second. What do you want, Charlie? I want to talk to you. It's all right. Everybody, take five. Kill Patsy's mike. God, Charlie, don't. I'm sorry. I did wrong. I will never raise a hand to you again. I swear it. I know you're thinkin' of leavin' me. I swear to God, I don't think I could take it. I don't know. Can't we try and make it right again? If you want a definite answer right this minute, the answer is no. I don't know if I can live with you anymore. Sweet dreams Of you Every night I go through Why can't I forget you And start my life anew Instead of having sweet dreams About you You don't love me It's plain I should know I'll never wear your ring I should hate you The whole night through Instead of having sweet dreams About you Sweet dreams Of you Things I know Can't come true Why can't I forget the past Start loving someone new Instead of having Sweet dreams About you Thank you. Tony, I gotta take a pee! Pretty Boy Floyd! Get this boy one. He's been on bread and water. Give me a drink. I've been in the jail. You drink any more, you'll wish you was dead when you wake up. Where was it you left your ball and chain? In my private room in prison. Take a walk. Charlie, finish this and let's get outta here, find us a couple of girlies. That's one thing I do not need. I got that already. Can everybody hear me? I got me a wife. She is hard to handle and as contrary as a hog on ice. That ain't half of it. You guys ain't got no idea what it's like... to be rubbing up against something that dangerous. That's what I like about the South Mama, hi! We're still at the airport. The weather bad? Yeah. We've spent the whole damn night here... but the first spot of good weather we'll take off. How are my babies? Just fine. Charlie came by the house with two quarts of ice cream. He did? He said he missed seeing them. I knew he couldn't stay away. He hadn't had a thing to drink. Good as gold. Hell, Charlie's always good. Except when he isn't. You just hurry home. Give those babies sugar for me. Of course. Let's go! Hot dog! This beats the hell out of drivin'! Let's get this show on the road. Looks like we might be in for a little fun. A little turbulence. Right tank's empty. Switching over. Oh, boy! What the hell's goin' on? What's the matter with this? Gotta drop the nose. Hold on. Kick it over. Come on, baby. Come on! Catch on! Come on, baby. It started. Oh, Lord, thank you! Attaboy, Randy. I almost peed my pants. I did pee in mine. My God! You can't work and take care of two babies. Look at me. I'll take the kids with me for a while. I'll be good to them. I know it. I know it.
