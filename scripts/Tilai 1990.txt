Nothing at all... Kougri! Don't move! It's your fault. Don't be insolent! They're going to fight... Tell the truth. Nogma... Father's married her... She's our mother. You're lying. | She was promised to me. Saga, you are a liar! She was promised to Father, he promised her to you, he's entitled to change his mind. You've cheated me! Saga! Do you think Saga's coming back? I don't know. Kougri... I don't love your father. I know... You still love Saga... But I love them both. Saga is my brother. Your husband is my father... Mother... it's Saga. Let me in! Mother... My son... Mother, it's been a while... My mind's made up, I'm leaving. Why? Because of Father... Don't be sad, | I'll see you again... I'll go, they may find me here. Saga! I saw Saga last night... What did he say? He's leaving home... What an ass! Does Father know? No... Not yet. What a mess... Where are you going? To see Saga. He must return home. | That's an order! All right... What do you want? Only to say hello... May I help? No, don't bother. Father wants to see you. Why did Father lie? Stay! Saga, forget all this. I won't. Don't push me too far... Understand? Poor fool. Mother... I'd like to talk... What about? What do you want? Tell me about life... and about Nogma... Stop bothering me. Kuilga! Nogma will come to love her husband, just like I came to love your father. | That's life. Poko, she's grown up, how about making a little brother. Nogma! Saga lives there. Liar! Who told you? Everybody knows. There he is... You still love him... Don't say such silly things! Listen. You can help me, it'll be our secret. Okay? Yes. Tenga, you're one of our elders, you're also Nogma's father... I've seen Saga. He won't come back. He accuses you of betraying him. He's blinded by anger and hate. He'll calm down... God be willing. But... Giving him another woman | would straighten things out. One woman? Why not two... One for him and one for you... You are right. One for him and one for me... I talked to Saga... Thank you, hold this... Wait for me at the well. Since Saga's back, | you're even more beautiful... Stop kidding me. Really... You were unfaithful... Forgive me, I was forced to marry your father, but I love you. Now, you're Father's wife, and you're my mother. But I love you too. Is that true? It's true. So, let's get away... I can't... because of my parents... Very well... You know where to find me... Saga! Yes. I'm happy... It was good... You're as good as ever... Yes, Nogma... I want to live with you. But it's impossible. Because of your family? Don't say that... It's all your fault. You've been gone so long... Two years... You're right, but all over, all the while, I was thinking of you... I love you. Swear it! I swear! Come! You took your time. Are you cross? Calm down, you'll get a reward. Let's go. Nogma, see you tomorrow! They are waiting for us. Father's there too. Come on! Tell them we are at Auntie's. There will be trouble. Look at them. Where have you been? Answer! Don't look at me, tell him. We were at Auntie's. Nomenaba, did you hear? Don't do it again. I didn't expect you. Sit down. You look sad... Because of Nogma? Not because of her, because of Saga. He came to see me. What did he say? Nothing... He's your son, forgive him. Not unless | he makes the first move... Let me in! Bitch, I'll teach you! Koudpoko... Koudpoko, let me in! Old fool! | Go and find someone else. Where are you going? You idiot, answer! Are you deaf? Answer! To Auntie's. Don't be long. Understand? All right. Just say hello. Where is she going? To her aunt's. She won't listen to me anymore. She would if you brought her up better. The idiots. They believed... we went to Auntie's. Today again, I said the same thing... We better watch out, anyway! Ganame, you were right. Where have you been? Speak up! Father knows where we were. You liar! Your aunt is here. Azeta. Didn't I warn you? Tenga. Leave her. Bitch! Nogma's to blame. She was with Saga. Weren't you? You're wrong. Tell them, Nogma. It's true. | She's not saying anything. Mother... Iet me explain... Clear your name first! Damn you! It's your fault. You have shamed me, Been thinking? They're being hard on Nogma! Nothing to say? Speak up! You know how I feel about it... but we can't do anything for her... It's her destiny... Her destiny? You're as bad as the rest... Mother... Only Tenga's missing... Let's start! Long... Long... Long... Long... Long... It's your turn... No... He's my brother... Take one! Short... Ganame... he's hanging himself... It's a question of honour. | Let's leave him. They're out there. They know all about... . Nogma and you. - Really? | - Yes. Then I've had it! What the hell is he doing? I'll never forget this. Thank you. Don't talk. Get going! There he is. Are you wounded? Give me the torch, bastard! Porgo... Kougri, you've killed him... I'm sorry... Your father hanged himself... Come back...Don't be afraid... Yero...! Stop... Stop... What do you want? Answer! Or I'll shoot... Keep away... I'll shoot... Come back... I was joking... You bitch... you've made me a widow. Mother... forgive her... Your husband is dead, but Nogma is your daughter. You can't reject her. Get out of my way! I never want to see you again... Hello. Man! What do you want? My aunt, don't you recognize me? I'm Saga, your nephew. Saga...are you Saga? I'm happy to see you... You've grown up... I've even grown a beard... Don't tease me... It isn't so long since | you were a baby... How about your mother, | your father, your brother...? They're fine... What's going on? Nothing... My aunt, I want to stay... Why? Just because... Aren't you happy? Yes... So laugh... Father, you were wrong... to hang yourself for nothing... Tell her everything... I didn't kill Saga... He's still alive... Is it true? It's true! Mother, Iet's go! Aren't you sleeping? I'm not sleepy. I violated tradition | by not killing Saga... My conscience troubles me. I understand. Nogma has gone... Good. It's all so complicated... We've all been stupid... Why did Father marry Nogma? And why did Saga rebel? My son, Iie down and sleep a while... | Such is the way of the world... Hello. Hello. Yero! I'm looking for a man: | tall and thin... I know him. He's violent. | He tried to kill us, didn't he? No, he didn't, you coward. Woman, he went that way. Thank you... Woman! Get on! I knew you were here. Tell me... Nogma's gone... I know. Everybody knows. If Saga were alive, they would meet... May be he is alive! You're getting crazy... No, I'm not, he may be alive... My beauty! Stay with me. No, I don't want to. I can't... I'm expected... I understand. What's wrong? Here! My aunt, she's better now. Nogma, my wife... Little fool, why didn't you tell me? She's beautiful... Welcome... You see? | Now, you're one of us... I'm glad. Thank you, my aunt. Let's go back. Where are they going? They're looking for Nogma... They won't find her. Have you seen her? That way. What's the matter? Answer me! You're thinking of Nogma. They'll find her... You're making my life a misery. You'll never find her. You see, they've failed. Pleased? Yes... Rub me down, I'm tired. That's just what I wanted to do. Things are changing... Yes, they are! They're shameless.. Let's not get in their way. Let's go. When I was coming here, I met a man... big, tall,... fat... He tried to rape me, | I ran and ran... I'll strangle him if I find him.... If I tell you a secret, will you give me a present? Two chickens? No. - A sheep. | - I Refuse. An ox. I accept. So...? I'm pregnant. Swear. I swear it. I'll go and tell my Aunt. My ox! My aunt... You look happy. I have good news, we're expecting a baby. He's right. I'm happy... if it's a boy, | name it Raogo, like Granfather Okay... And if it's a girl, | it'll be Bore, like you. Very well. Come with me. Your mother's ill. What? She's vomiting... Porgo. she's hot... She's been vomiting... You'll feel better soon. Father... you're tired. No, I'm fine. I can cope. We'll be waiting outside. Is he the rapist? Yes. He's not as you described him... big, tall... fat... He's no rapist. I was lying. Do you love him? He's just someone I met. You are the one I love. Tell the truth, is it my child you're expecting? Yes, it's yours. Come. Do you like it here? Do you? Your aunt loves me... I'm like her daughter. But sometimes, I think of my family, of my sister Kuilga... even of my mother, | though she doesn't love me now. We're doomed to live here... Here comes Maiga, | with your sheep. Liar! You promised me an ox. I was joking...Come. It's nice...but so tiny. Butcher him, then. What does he want? To see Aunt Bore... I've come a long way... Koudpoko is ill. Seriously ill. She's my mother... Farewell. He's gone. Shit! I'll catch him... What's the matter? | Why are you following me? Ilassa!... Ilassa! | Koudpoko is dead... Where are they going? Koudpoko is dead. It's Saga. You're right. It's Saga. No, he's dead. It's his spirit. Things are going to get hot! Of course! Forgive me... I had no choice... because of Mother... You liar! You swore | you'd never come back here. You've shamed me, killed me... I'm sorry, but... Iet me see her... We'll talk later. You bastard! | Don't touch her. It's your fault. You're banished! It's Kougri... He didn't even greet us. Let's hurry, then.
