Come on! - You coming to town? - No. Cows busted the trough. Got ot go fix it. - You wonder I should leave the horse? - No. Are you sure? My headache is coming... I have the tickets here for my brother and me. The army sent them to us. And I have an authorization letter too. You've awake now. TOPEKA, KANSAS THE MENNINGER SCHOOL OF PSYCHIATRY STAFFS and RESIDENTS, 1946 You went blind? Third time this year, sir. You don't need to "sir" me. When it happens does everything go black, or... It's flecks of light. But then they go away. Where were you injured? In France. No, I meant where on your body. He fractured his skull in the war. And the Fort Benton VA said that they couldn't do anything for us so they sent us here. That's a long trip. They even paid for our tickets. Well, they damn right to. The Winter Hospital is the best place in the country for brain traumas. After the war, my brother lost his job with the railroad. He couldn't hear the trains anymore, because of his ears. And then it was his eyes. The headache are the worse. He can't even breathe. It scares me. We keep him with us now, at my ranch. My husband says the army didn't do the x-rays right. Maybe there is a shard of bone or something that they missed. Okay, it's on. We'll run a whole new set of tests and get you back on your feet. You fought for your country. This is the least they can do for you. If they open my brain it will kill me. Sunday you can go to church. Hello, time to go now. Your brother will be home soon. It wasn't a life you are living, you are only half alive. Next please! - Name please? - James Picard. When were you demobbed? February 1945. - Division? - 66th Armored Regiment. 10 Corp. Corporal. Do you know your blood type? No, ma'am. Are you married? Divorced. Any children? Not exactly. How can someone "not exactly" have children? - Another man brought up my daughter. - Oh. Six foot one and a half. I just want you to describe the situation you see, what the people think and what the outcome is. You're not answering? Eyes right. Down. What do you see on the card? I'll tell you about a picture I see every night. A picture of a high wall. Long and deep. And I was standing on top of it. I always feel like I want to fall off but I never do. And here? Is this a dream that you're telling me? It's in my head though... Our x-ray shows no sign of a current fracture. Possible traces but there's a shadow here. Your guess? Diploid vascular markings. Nothing serious. He was wounded during the war, wasn't he? The records unclear. He supposedly was in a coma for more than two days but... I really can't say. I saw a scar. He gets disability compensation. He's definitely partial hearing loss in the left ear. The eardrum? But I found no physiological explanation for it. Cerebral activity is perfectly normal. We could make him some glasses... He has diplopia or narrow gaze, that's all. Great! So we have a vet who is an invalid in perfect health! Dr. Holt? He passed his psychologicals? Patient refused to comply. He kept saying his head hurt. Jokl, have you seen our new recruit? No. Not yet. I'm seeing him tomorrow. But I little listed all symptoms you have described. Migraines, diplopia, bright spots, suffocation, ventricular pain, temporary paralysis of the left arm, hemiplegic sensation. I'm adding catatonia and autistic withdrawal... I'm afraid it rather sounds like mental disorder. Sometimes the guys says he doesn't know if he's awake or dreaming. So you have, cat and rat case. You mean... schizophrenia? Gentlemen, we were supposed to create a haven here. For every man. Have we ever treated an...? No. We only have one Indian. The catatonic. Shelling in Okinawa. Dear sir, Dr. Menninger suggested that I write to you. We have an Indian patient who in terms of our usual criteria, may conceivably be psychotic. At the same time, it is possible that we maybe misevaluating his psychiatric status since he maybe merely an Indian, whose personality and behavior we do not fully understand. For this reason, a consultation with an anthropologist is required. Dr. RR Holt, reporting to the the ward physician. BROOKLYN, NY It's for me. (Thank you). Georges Devereux speaking. What a pain to have to call you in a bar. Oh Karl , my friend. I'm a bit pissed at you these days, but it's great to hear your voice. What's new in Topeka? Well I'll look into that... Did you get our letter from our psychologist? Dr. Holt got it. And it happens that I am free at the moment. Well don't get carried away. I still can't bring you aboard here. All we need is a psychiatric evaluation. We have an Indian here. Which ethnic group? I'm looking at the report now... - Siksika. - A blackfoot! Don't tell me you know the blackfoot. Two weeks ago, Margaret Mead came to town and told me fascinating things about the Blackfoot. The family structure is so close to the Mojaves. I'm sure you'll be able to lend us a hand. The administration has agreed to one or two consultations. Three days tops. Yeah I have the flight schedule right here, I can be in Topeka tonight. - You will be taking a train. - Perfect... Second class. And this is not a full time job offer, it is a one shot consultation. - See you soon. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Topeka! On behalf of the Veterans Administration and the Winter Hospital staff I'd like to welcome our newcomers. Men, we have lots of telephones... You have to take this. ... encourage you to stay in touch with your loved ones and they are free at cost. If you have any questions about your compensation or your disability let us know and we'll help to the best we can. We have incoming mail at 8 and mail goes out at 4. There is a bus definitely twice a day. If you have any questions, my door is always open. Feel free to come and we'll take care of whatever issues you have. - What the fuck. - Come on. - Come on, get him off! - Take it up! Somebody call the duty doctors. A chance for your light? That kid scared you a little, didn't he? I don't know what I'm doing here. I can't say grobal. Boilermaker, please. Can I see your ID? If the cops show up, you're Mexican. So, where were you? Army, Navy? Army. You're at the hospital for busted heads, right? I'm in the dark there. Nobody tells me a fucking thing. You a Pawnee? Can't be. 'Cause I'd know you. What you doing in Topeka? I have never seen an Indian nurse at the Winter Hospital. You must be a labourer. 10 o'clock curfew? Baby got to go to bed? Rise and shine! What's the matter boys? Time to clean up. Wakey! Wakey! Was it necessary? The alcohol and the tranquilizers. I couldn't take that chance. Do Indians commit suicide? I don't know. The ticket, please sir. - Your ticket. - Uh, of course. Where did I put that? This? No. Here it is. Welcome to the Wild West! It's good to see you again, Devereux. Your client is no piece of cake. He hasn't spoken one word in two weeks. Yesterday he went into town and came back dead drunk, with a bottle of liquor. Which have been to closest to war... - He was violent? - Oh no. The guy was very quiet. Behold our Indian brave! You already know Dr. Jokl, our psychiatrist, and Dr. Holt. This is Dr. Devereux. Good morning. He came from New York just for you. To record, push down. Oh thank you. I don't think we will need it. Have a nice chat. You can have a seat if you wish. May I introduce myself. I am the hospital anthropologist. I am interested in Indians. And if you don't mind, I'd like to find out a few things about you. What is your Indian name? Oh-Gunidep-Puyop. Oh, I don't speak Pikunni. May I ask you what it means? "Everybody talks about him." Which society does your family belong to? "Crazy Dogs" society. And to what church do you belong? I am Catholic. Dr. Holt told me you dream a great deal. In what language do you dream in? In English, most of the time. What is the blackfoot word for "dream"? Ipa-pong-kaa. As you can hear I was born in Europe and my English sounds a bit rough. - Does it bother you? - No. So... Tell me about your parents. My father died of heart trouble when I was five. I was raised by my older sister and brother-in-law. What about your mother? My mother was very strict. Was your mother a 'manly hearted' woman? Huh. Did I say something silly? How do you know that? In Mojave we say 'manly hearted' woman. How do you say it in blackfoot? Mukakya-ki. My mother ran her place like a man. My sister is the same way. Can you talk to me about your sister? My sister doesn't drink or smoke. She's a mission school girl. She is the oldest child. She married to an important functionary of the tribe. His name is Jack. By what kinship the rimbulu called him? My brother-in-law, Nestamu. Do you have any brothers? Yes, but I don't see much of them. I am the youngest. You seem to think of your sister much the same way you think of your mother. They are almost the same in my mind. You admire your sister a lot, don't you? Yes And what do you do as an anthropologist? Well... we study all aspects of human beings. Language, techniques, physiology... That's why you want to learn Indian words? Yes. I lived with the Mojave for two years. - In the desert? - Yes. I was able to learn their language and their history. What is life like for the Mojave? Not as desperate as the Navajos. But they have a pretty hard time. Not to offend you, but whites do not like us much. That doesn't affect me at all. It is strange living in a place where people are soul sick. - Do you want to smoke? - No. First, I brush some ink on the paper. And then you can draw with your finger. Easy, here we are. What should I draw? Whatever you want. I'm not good at drawing. What is it? A landscape. Perfect. Both drawings are separated into 3 strips. But the boundaries are not cut off. There is a hidden part here in the buttress. And a route crosses through the strips. So there is no fractioning. I see no trace of schizophrenia, neither latent, nor - Are you sure? - I'd stake my life on it. This man is not mad. He must be removed as quickly as possible from the closed ward. George! Two pictures are all you need? Oh, more than enough. At the base of this drawing a completely repressed pre-Oedipal stage. Here, a house. for a right-handed heterosexual male, the mother, or a mother equivalent. Two mountains, are the breasts. And threatening clouds above his sister's ranch. The patient depicts himself in front of a barn. He wouldn't talk to anybody, doctors or patients. You asked for my opinion, here it is. Jimmy Picard is not crazy. Or else you have to lock up half of our fellow citizens. So, what is he suffering from? I guess what we all suffer from. So what do you suggests we do? George, you know how I feel. But the AAP needs paperwork, anything legal. No! Karl, they'll get their papers. Hey, you're not even an MD. I know, no psychoanalysis. Just counseling. Research counseling, got it? - Control session with Jokl? - Jokl. If they don't work out, you go straight back to New York. Terrific! I may have administration wise, but let me tell you, Mon'Amie... that doesn't allow you to break the rules. Which rules am I going to break here? Don't be exuberant! Is your British friend still in New York? - Madeleine? - Trs charmant! (Very charming) Jeanetta and I were wondering if she might pay us a visit. Nah, I bet she would. If Jimmy is not sick, then isn't that good news? Since we found nothing physiological, we were wondering whether the illness may be psychiatric. However Mr. Devereux doesn't consider you a schizophrenic. Then... I can go home? I think you're in real pain. You can see Mr. Devereux, for a while, an hour a day. He can't treat you, in the strict sense of the word. But maybe he can help. You should not have drank here. - You should drink less. - Hello! Dr. Devereux has asked us to move you into another ward. Hello, my name is Alma. What do we have here? I have the school records. Look! They thought the world of you. You can take your time now. The rapport was good and simplify sufficient. The patient reacted in a spontaneous and normal manner. I decided to study and counsel the patient. Come in, please. Follow me. It's an unorthodox setting, but anyway... You don't look too good. Just a slight fever. Don't worry. Did you dream anything? I had a dream last night. I was butchering some beef. What breed of cattle was it? White face, Hereford. Hereford. What was the locality of the dream? On my sister's ranch. Doctor, when I go to bed, I'm always short of breath. Could you explain how it feels? Well, as soon as I lied down, I'm afraid my heart will miss a beat. I always have to get up and get some water. I also have these attacks in the afternoon. Stepping back to your dream. What does it make you think of? The other night, I read an article in a magazine, about a... couple in Alaska. And they butchered three moose. Do you think that's possible? That's a lot of meat for two people. Well, I couldn't say. The night before,, I had a nightmare. I had a fight with a man. I could not run away, or raise my arms. I couldn't yell for help. The man took out his knife and went through me. I woke up and jumped out of bed. I don't know who the man was. How would the old Blackfoot interpret such a dream? I don't know much about the old Blackfoot ways. What did this man look like? He was big and tall. That much I remember. Was this man an Indian or a white? The man was white. He was an American. He wore blue overalls. - Well, do your brothers dress like that? - No. My brothers wear dressy clothes to go into town. How about your father? My father wore a blue serge suit to go to church. I was very young when he died. I don't remember much about him. Do you see any connection between the two dreams? They both have knives. The Blackfoot believe that dreams foretold the future. We think that dreams shed a little light on the past. That is why I am interested in them. Come on, just say anything that goes through your mind. I wonder about going back to school. They offer an AAD in leatherwork. I got a good record in college. My sister brought the records. They're with my papers. I got a daughter, you know. I saw that in your file. I had her very young. Her mother died three years ago. Her family is from Spokane. I married another woman. What did you call her, the woman who had a child by you? I called her Jane. It tsi kay sha pini akii. It means: "Bright Eyed Girl". Very nice. I want my daughter to come and live with me. She's in high school. She doesn't like being with her grandmother, though she doesn't complain. The two of them live all alone way out in the country. Later on, maybe I'll get married again. What is her Indian name? She has none. - Well, tell me what is her English name? - Mary Lou. How old is Mary Lou? Thirteen. Is she already a woman? I mean, is your daughter passed her puberty? She visited us... Two years ago, I lived with a Kaini woman. She got along very well with Mary Lou. Afterwards she went back to Canada. How old was this Kaini woman? She was my age. Do Blackfoot usually marry a woman their own age? I never thought about that. What kind of a wife do you want? Okay. I have to leave you now. It is four thirty. I come to see you tomorrow. Doctor... In the last few days, I haven't had any headaches. Well, you see! Not only are you not going crazy here, but even your headaches have stopped. That's right. I'm . Good day. Tomorrow. Hello Jimmy! Dr. Devereux asked me to tell you, he cannot see you today. He is not feeling well and need some bed rest. But not to worry, he'll be on his feet tomorrow. Desmond? Is that where the French doctor lives? All the new doctors stay there. Look at this. Good Lord. Peace time! Anyhow, he was on borrowed time. I'm not getting up. Please have this chair. You don't look any better. No, I'll be perfectly fine, thank you. Please, sit. I've been divorced for years. Yet I feel like I'm just loafing around waiting for my ex-wife. What do you feel you lost with this woman? I'm sorry about my house. Well, do you mean house or home? House and all that land. 900 acres. You see when I left, Lily got the house... and all that land. And she had no kids to worry about. Then... when I came back from the war I got off the train, I had no place to go. She had taken up with another man. And this man was living off my army pay. I felt like killing him. I know how it feels. My brother-in-law told me not to ruin my life over a woman. So instead, I got Jack's car, went to the lawyer, and the divorce came through in nine days. I miss her... How about sexual relations? I had girls back home. That's a nice pen, doctor. Oh, I write down all that you say to think about it afterwards. You don't worry, do you? It's exactly what I said. Yes. Lily... I'm not proud of it, but... I'm afraid from time to time I've had to give a woman a good slap, you know. It helps to clear the air, doesn't it? Me, I could never hit a woman. In olden times a Blackfoot could beat his wife and cut off her nose. Granted, that's pretty violent. - He could also beat his sister, right? - Yes. What kind of woman was a man not allowed to beat? My mother's first husband was Chief White Calf. But they had no children. I read that White Calf was a great chief! Then he died and my mother married my father. My sister also had a first husband who died. They had no children either. What about your ex-wife? Lily? She was sterile. Oh rubbish! Well I think she was. Lily said that she didn't want children. No one uses it, except during parties. I don't know if it is in tune. The day of the partition of Palestine Jokl was beating away at it like a madman. Oh uh. The administration received a telegram. It's for you. Please read it. It's Madeleine. That's great! "Believe it or not I'll be in Topeka in three days." - Do you know how the war went for her? - Tough! She was stuck in Paris with her husband. Ligez Lukasz must have spent three years in the cellar. Her family? Madeleine is Christian. And her family stays in Sheffield. They won't even change. You know, I never dared to ask you... about your mom and dad. Anyone deported? It's easy to hide in Romania. I will tune it. Focus again. Better or worse? - Better. - Oh, good. So, we're making him some glasses? Indeed we are. Are you happy? Yes, thank you. All is well with Mr. Devereux? Yes, ah... He's feeling much better. Good! I wouldn't have missed this, for the world. I brought your English saddle. It weighs a ton! Thank you a million! Is this car yours? Classy, ain't it? How's the big city without me? All your friends love me! It's... Spartan! Well, I'm going to teach some Indian anthropology. Menninger promised me. It's for you. I don't like surprises. Doctor Freud... Tell me now, what the hell are you doing here? I was curious to see your new place. Why? I'm not going to tell you. Oh, I'll book a nice hotel room in Topeka. It's too late! Everyone in the hospital knows that a "friend" is visiting. Menninger even opened up a bungalow just for you. Good evening. A welcome treat. Compliments of Winter Hospital. Gorgeous! Come closer. I want to kiss you. Your Indian? It's a secret, madam. Looks like a plan. You wrote all this? My... what else do you want me to to do here? They just give me one session a day. So after I'm back here, I pace through and through in my bed, like a criminal on probation. Yes, I start to write. You don't remember everything? Every single line. I have all his words going in my head. I was worried about your eyes. To tell you the ophthalmologist wasn't very optimistic. My vision keeps getting worse. For once, not to be, I couldn't read. Do you see me? Blurry? Double? Triple. I see you very well. We are at the end of the world. No, this is not the end of the world. It is. What? And we're lost. - Good morning. - It's nice how empty it is on Sunday. To what church do you belong to? I don't belong to any church. You don't believe in God? I just believe in doing good. I want to send some money to my daughter. She wrote me. She's pretty mad at me because I haven't written to her lately. That's Mary Lou. Well, it's a very tender letter. I had a strange dream last night. But when I woke up I couldn't remember a thing. Could you close your eyes? Tell me the first thing you visualize. You. Did you dream of me? We were out hunting. I had a gun. You didn't. And then... I saw a bear. And my gun jammed. And then the bear started chasing us. And I kept jerking the lever and nothing happened. And... you told me to put in one bullet at a time. And I did that. And then I was in another dream. Now we hunted foxes. I had a rifle, a 22 and you had none. I shot the fox. And I picked it up. And you were talking to me. And then... A live baby? He was either dead or asleep. After that I woke up in a sweat. I didn't know a dream. I'm just like the animal headed person of the ancient braves. Their protection gave courage. Old timers say they used to dream of a beaver. And the Beaver gave them advice and blessed them. Then they would pray to the beaver. And now you see why you started today by talking about religion. Dreaming of me was like dreaming of a spirit head. Were you scared when the gun jammed? No, I wasn't. In dreams, one tries to tell something to oneself too. What are you telling yourself? You can't kill a bear, but you can kill a fox, in your dream. Maybe the dream says we ought to start with your little troubles first. That's a good interpretation. In the first dream, what kind of bear was it? - A brown bear. - Male or female? I don't know. And the child it was naked. Boy or a girl? The child didn't look hurt, and it had no bullet hole in it. Make a guess. A girl, maybe. And who is this baby girl? First it was a fox. And then when I looked down, it was a baby girl. Foxes are hairy. When do baby come out to something hairy? Out of a woman? What happened afterwards? I let her down. What does this mean, let down? That I have done wrong. But you couldn't help it. You were so young. You were under pressure. Maybe you did wrong with your daughter, and let her down. But you couldn't help it. Come on, you were only 17, you had nothing. Today, you're good with your daughter and you support her. That's what matters. I almost have $500 in the bank. But I can't take a penny out unless someone else signs for it. I have to go downtown tomorrow. I can take you to the post office, if you like. That's very nice. "The central theme of this session was the aggressive element in sexual behavior. It is interesting to note that the patient denied that the baby was dead because it had no hole in it. This remark further underscored patient's castration anxiety and his tendency to define women as blind or dead." Where on earth did you meet such a guy? It's silly. My husband first met George in a waiting room in Paris. They worked for the same psychoanalyst. I was working at the Muse de l'Homme (Museum of Man). Do you know how many women Georges officially married? Two, just two. What are they possibly talking about? I have no idea. I like France. I like the people there. Why? Farmers, ranchers. My kind of people. Did you ever visit Paris? Two days. We were camped in... Vincennes? Did you have to kill anyone in the war? No. By the time I got to France, the krauts had already left. Why can't my friend receive money without my signature? I don't make the rules, sir. I want like to send the money order to Spokane, Washington. Okay. You have to file a form. - Can you write? - Yes. Who taught you all these things about dreams? Some man taught me. I paid him very little because I had so little money. Now I do what the Indians do. When they're young, they help the old. And when they get old, somebody helps them. Sometimes dreams come true. Where I live, if you ever come, suppose a man can't find his horses. He pays an old man and the old man goes to sleep and dream. And the next day, he'll find your horses for you. What? You never hear about dreams that didn't come true. I remember this guy on the reservation. Hey! This guy was a funny one. He told us he dreamt that he could fly if he performed the ceremony with a dance. So one day, he tied a buffalo rope to his arms and legs, and we all walked to the top of this sheer cliff. And he did his medicine dance. And then... he jumped and... He broke every bone in his body. I could talk about dreams all day. Gayle, since I was 16 I've just disappointed you all. But I can't feel ashamed. Here, I feel both alone and peaceful. My life became such a mess. Everyday I see the French doctor. He often asks me to tell him my dreams. I tell him about the past as well. This morning, I remember the accident that led me to this hospital. We were in the forest. There were no German soldiers. Just frozen corpses. There's one here for you too, Greeney. Alright Jimmy, I got a present for you. Got a nest somewhere. Everybody got letters from their girlfriends. Lily didn't write to me. My letter was from Cousin Dale. And he told me that Lily had a lover. I couldn't get that picture out of my head. My wife, walking around Browning, holding hands with another man. I saw them at my kitchen table. I saw them laughing at my bed. Everybody was so tired and worn out. I just remember how quiet it was. When I woke up in the hospital, I could not see. A nurse was talking to me. My ear was draining. It was something like fat and bloody. What do you think that was? Well, it may be pus, from your middle ear. Probably from your accident. Dr. Menninger says my head is fine. I'd like you to do another neurological exam. You think there's something still wrong with my head? Oh no, I don't think so. After dinner I was reading in my room and the pain started again. Were you wearing your new glasses? No, I hate them. Do you know anyone who wears glasses? - You do! - Listen... I look squarely at things with my glasses. You seem to hesitate to identify with me. You're always asking me to remember things that happened before the army. But I never had a headache... before my accident. Maybe Dr. Menninger is wrong and there's a real problem with my brain. Mm hm, your headaches surely had a physiological origin, and since the war, they may have become psychogenic. Your body has healed. But when your mind is in pain, the headaches come back. It feels pleasant to feel I'm justly wrong too. But you must tear yourself away from the past. How long will you stay here? I guess until my patient is cured. Which means... A month? A year? Ouch! Oh, it's so good to have you here! - Do you know what Jimmy's name is? - No. Ohonita-e-Puyopei. It means: "Everybody talks about him." You have a hidden name too. No, I don't hide anything. No, your name is Gyrgy Dob. I changed names. I don't believe it! You didn't tell your patient you're French, did you? My place of birth has no bearing on Jimmy's cure. You lied. He was supposed to be here at 5. Well, if you went back and get him away. - Sorry. - Oh, this is my friend, Madeleine. Un bon ami. (A good friend) - Jimmy has been to France. - Enchant. (Nice to meet you) So, you like museums. Yeah, um... Admittance was free. We're heading back to the hospital. Can we offer you a ride? You smoke? Smoke. I got secrets, cousin. Tonight... I'll be... flying among the pine trees... like fire! You keep on crowning cousin. Keep on crowning. - George? - Oh God. Lost in your thoughts? Just loafing. You know, free associating... - Are you busy? - Well... Not at all. You know this Blackfoot practice we call "Pisting"? The husbands used to pull the labia of their wives. Some of the old ladies had 3 inches long labia! Alas, no one's playing this game anymore. That's a pity! Jimmy and I, both would give anything to see just one. - Can you imagine? - No. Listen... You got a letter this morning. From France. Not a very nice letter. A copy was sent to the American Psychoanalytic Association. They don't recommend accepting you as an analyst. If you went back to France, could you work it out? I don't even know. Well, at least, you have worked here. One patient? And take good care of him. Don't be ashamed. It is important that you depend on me to access. It is also important that you understand it and fix it. That is what cures you. If only I knew... Is there anything that suggests childhood? Well, there are things that happened when I was real small... that no one knows about. There were two girls that lived nearby. They were sisters. One of them was younger than me and the other one was older. We were playing on the ice and the younger one fell. I didn't help for I was so scared. I ran away. She drowned. How old were you then? I was five or six... before my father died. It was bad. The older sister... of the girl that drowned... she used to go and play in the shed. And she would call me in. Make me play with her vagina. I didn't know what it was for. How old was this girl? She was about six years older than me. Did you put it in? No. Just your hand? I always wanted to leave. But she would drag me back in and forced me to do it again. Then one day, my sister caught us. She beat the living tar out of me right there. Filthy! Filthy! Then she told my mother. But I lied. I never admitted it. This first, you mentioned the drowning and fear. Then sex and lie. When you were a, be the as a sniper, in the army. Did you have a telescope on your rifle? Yes, I did. Did you ever... spy on anyone during your childhood? Sex spying? About a year after my father died, one day... I came home from school and when I went in, I saw... a woman... My mother. In bed with another man. I don't know who the other man was. I left her and ran away. I got to my sister's house. She was married already. I was never with my mother ever since. Gayle raised me up from then on. Well, you were punished for playing with the girl, whose sister died. But this man didn't get punished for being with your mother, when your father died. I guess all my thoughts are mixed up. The child saw himself naturally replacing his dead father in the parental bed. But what a disappointment when he finds his mother in someone else's arms. "That's my place!" The boy sees the lover's penis. He can't stop looking at the fascin. I don't believe the little boy desires that penis. No, he's Hamlet. He wishes to take the place of the lover! Congratulations! So now, you should shift to the passive technique. Just stop interfering. Jimmy will find his way through the dark forest. I'll see you tomorrow. Atterr. Busy? Come on! Wait. - Hurry up! - Yup! My husband wrote... - Anything wrong? - No. Lukasz and his friends. He is lost without me. Last year I was sure he had an affair with this blonde. I don't blame him. Around him I'm so happy. With you, I'm light. But in real life I'm heavy. You don't seem so light to me. He sent me this ticket. Your husband is a great man. FIRST CLASS The Queen Ann The Queen Anne leaves for France from New York the first Friday of next month. Madeleine I'm never go back to France. Let the stick decide... Falls back toward me, and I stay here, as I always do. Falls forward toward you... Well, that's the law. Here it goes Ann. Well Ann, you win. It's in the law. I have always been a man who let a woman die. We talked about my daughter's mother, right? Jane's family came to Browning for the winter. When they started school, they have charity balls, card parties, anything to raise money. That night there was to be a dance. That same afternoon, Jane told me she was gonna have a baby. She was two months along. It was our secret. She asked me to come to the dance. She was coming with her folks. I need my best horse tonight. I got on my good clothes ...and told my sister I was going to the ball. Make us all proud. Come on! I looked across the room and saw Jane in the back with her mother. She was pointing at me. I was in the doorway and another girl said to me: "I'm sick. I gotta go home..." "Can you take me back?" I said sure. I took the girl to the house, I rode right back to the dance. As I tied up my horse behind a round horn, I saw a man and a boy... I mean... a man and a girl along the trail coming from behind the haystack. At first, I paid no attention. But then I walked in and they were right behind me. My daughter's mother with another boy. Then she came to me and started talking about us having to marry. Jimmy! I've been looking for you everywhere. I had to go. This afternoon you said you would talk about marriage. My mother is waiting. I thought. "Why was she behind the haystack?" I felt bad... I said: "Tomorrow I have to help my brother-in-law feed the sheep". And I went home. Fine, leave! You can't dance anyway! After that night, I ducked every time I saw her in town. Then the school found out about Jane and they kicked me out. When her family asked, I refused to marry her. We had a trial. The first time I met Jimmy, it was at my uncle's house. They said the child was mine. Our cousin Jack was visiting. It was a sunny day. And he came to me. And we knew each other. Your Honor, my client comes from one of the most respected families in the... Well, I had this lawyer. He must have been really good because he won. He beat that case. I was free. But I felt like hell. Paternity has not been established. Therefore, in the case of WhiteCloud versus Picard a suit of custody brought by the plaintiff Jane WhiteCloud, the court finds the defendant. We say that James Picard is not the father of the child to come. After the trial, Jane still asked me to marry her. I asking you to marry me. And if you change your mind and propose to me, I want you to know, I will say yes. All I know is what I saw at the dance. What did you see? You're just an idiot, you're just a plain idiot. My mother turned on me, called me many names. Spring time came. Her family had to move on. Later, I heard that Jane had had a girl. A year later, I came across the guy who was behind the haystack. His name was Allan. Jimmy, this is funny. I thought sure you and Jane would get married. Remember the ball? I was with Jane when she saw you go out with that other girl. Oh, she got mad. I tried to calm her down. She asked me to go outside. We were looking for you in the cold. She could have ripped you to shreds. Then there was the army... my accident... And my divorce with Lily. If Jane had not told her daughter, Mary Lou would have not known I was her father. I'm begging with you, please just slow down. Then one day, we saw each other again. Hey soldier! They said you were back in town. So many years... I was another man I guess, but Jane still wanted me. You've been all over the world! - Is your husband here? - No. He stayed in Spokane. He couldn't get off work. - Is that her? - Yes. I named her Mary Lou. She has heard about you. We were together all that afternoon and night. I let her go. She told me she was just having some gallstones removed. Tomorrow I have to go to the hospital. They're going to operate on me. I would rather have you there beside me than my husband. That night I prayed she would outlive me. I mean I drank a lot back in those days. Thinking of my dying made me peaceful. I was supposed to meet Jane, after the operation. So I grabbed some money from the bank... At the station there was this girl, a friend of Jane I knew from school. - What are you doing in town? - I'm taking this dream liner to go see Jane. I asked her why she was crying. She said that afternoon a telegram had come that Jane had died. I'm so sorry, Jimmy! That's how it was... It was Tuesday. Jane must have died on a Sunday. They buried her there. How could someone die of gallstone? I don't know. That is the worst thing I ever did in my life. I never robbed a bank, never killed anybody. She had written to me before the operation. But I got the letter after she died. My love, I wish I weren't married, so I can marry you over and over. My heart belongs to you. You're the only man who ever counted. If anything happens to me, take care of our daughter. Jane. See you tomorrow. My family wanted me to marry a good Indian girl who doesn't sleep with her first boy she meets. Gayle thought Jane was stupid. And Lily? Lily she was... Lily she made it work. But she was slippery. How much longer do I have to stay here? How long does it take to prep runaway horses? No one could tell. Perhaps it is time for this procedure we spoke of. And what exactly will they do to me? - They'll blow air into your brain. - How? Through the spinal cord. They'll see if all the parts of your brain are joined together properly. Has anyone died from it? None that I know of. We called you here to let you know that I was ill. Why is camping here for if you are ill? Why not stay home? And what's the hanging missionary for? We're almost through. If you look far, you'll see that there's still one acre left to skive. As soon as they're finish, they go home. I have to get back. I have a curfew. Picard, you must move out! Everyone is leaving. How so? Jimmy is sad because we will soon be parting. How do you know when analysis is over? There's are no rules. You put... the soul in the heart. The heart in the mind. And mind... in the body. And the body... in the person. Wah lah! - Hello! - Yes I'm just here to check about my patient. We are still waiting for the oxy-encephalogram and he is starting to get anxious. Well, I put it in my report quite a while ago. I can't inject gas into the spinal column of a drunk. Jimmy hasn't been drinking. Are you kidding... Thank you. Your Indian went on a little jaunt the other night. We had to pick him up, carry him back to his room. You'd never make such a fuss about a white man! This is a gross misconduct! I demand the oxy-encephalogram for my patient. And I demand a radio as well! The Palace of Theseus Go, Filostrato Stir up the Athenian youth to marriages. Awake hurt and ... Last night, I went to a show. Little people worked with fingers. Every time an act was over... the bright lights came on and they gave me a sharp pain in the head. Remember the rules. Don't try to think, just let it happen. I can't think what it could be. It will come. Once you're able to stand it. It is possible that I saw something that might have triggered the pain? It's possible. Well, that play made me mad! How now Spirit! With a wandering... There were two guys arguing over a woman. There was a fairy. There was a guy with a donkey head! Honestly, I didn't get a damn thing about that play! It's rare that you don't understand something? What did I see last night? Two men fighting over a woman. What does that mean? You know sometimes we have scars on our body and we don't know where they come from anymore. There are such scars in the mind too. It is twelve. We should stop now. When I was looking at that show. There were the puppets. And there was the guy who makes them move, right? Well, one of them stood crooked. Its legs were folded up. And I thought : That's exactly what the doctor says. I'm not standing on my own feet. If that little guy used his own strength he'd be fine. I hated comparing myself to the puppet. I was over-powered. Everything I do is wrong. As though the man above is to blame. You're a person of dignity and worth. No one is pulling your strings here. When we first talked, why did you bring up religion? The way I recall it, you asked about my religion. No, no. In one night, you turned me away from all religions. Now, my mind is turned away from all religions for the rest of my life. The only advice I ever gave you, was to be your own master. You know I was Catholic. There are lots of Catholics in this country! Why you try to cut us down? You know I have nothing against the Indians. So now you imagine I have something against your church. I think you're wrong. Okay. Explain to me why I am wrong. Well... when I first started out, I was as green as that ashtray. Then you quit talking to me and I had to figure it out all by myself. Religions are courage builders, right? Well, I know a guy back home. He doesn't believe in anything. Not in the Indian religion, not in the Christian religion. And he's the biggest drunk that ever walked. And he's a thief. Well, he does without religion. And you're afraid of becoming a thief or a drunk? I drink. But I'm not a drunk. You seem uncomfortable. You're not afraid of me? Not that I know of. I would have preferred, liked it much better if you had told me about it... I mean, about your getting drunk the other night. I don't care about your getting plastered. Why be afraid to tell me? Alcohol has nothing to do with my headaches. Hell, maybe I'm just plain crazy... - You never were crazy. - Okay. Then why am I in this ward? You know, on the reservation we have an "Indian agent" to tell us what to do. I have lived all my life under that shit. Then I come here, to the Winter Hospital, and it's even worse. I got to get away from all that. If a man keeps on taking these things, as time goes on, they pile up. And one day it gets to be too much. Like you said: it pours out in the weakest part of the body. It's like... pounding in one spot. And that spot would be my head. I'm glad you're longer scared of criticizing me. I was waiting for this. The day after tomorrow at four? Whenever you want. I'm the one who's locked up here. Do you need some help? My dear... - Can I take it? - Well, be my guest. I woke up drunk. I've been such a good soldier up to now, haven't I? You will be a big hit on the boat. Doctor Devereux! My handsome Indian: My fondest thoughts for you. I should say goodbye more tenderly, but... I forgot which words to use. I'm abandoning you. You will soon be a learned doctor. You'll find a good American wife. Go for the rich one. But never forget to what extent I am the most precious part of you. Never severe the delicate thread that binds us. We can never forget the radiant love which was ours. Will you come and visit me one day... What nonsense I'm writing here? You, crossing the sea, just to see me. Write to me! For the love of God, write to me often. Madeleine. Yeah, if we find he's in perfect health, I'll have to tell the BA. What Dr. Braatoy means is, would your rather get well or keep your pension? Without the headaches, I'm fine. Good! As soon as the guy hears that his pension is cut, troubles come back. You're fit, Chief! Sir. My name is Jim. You call me Jim, not Chief. Miss. I was supposed to get a check from accounting. Oh. We have all the time in the world. Don't worry, son. I'll take some blood as soon as I have a second. They might be closing soon and I'm afraid they're not opened on Saturday. They're open Saturday mornings, sure, I promise. I'll get my test and you'll get your check tomorrow. You can paint the town red! Accounting Office Hours Mister! Are you sick? Mister, you want me to call a nurse? Oh Lord! Well, it's the lungs not his heart. You think you can get up? I was half asleep and the pain was big. It felt my heart was gonna stop. I didn't move an inch. Little by little the pain went away. Don't know what caused it. You don't have heart trouble. I'm sure of that. Maybe it was the way the doctor talked to me. What about this nurse? You told me something about her. You wanted to withdraw your money... Maybe the nurse doesn't know that the place was closed on Saturdays. But she has been here long enough to know. I thought it was maybe a test or doctor's orders. It wasn't doctor's orders. You just can't fight with a woman. Can you? Don't mix me up. It's not right to yell at women. But you yelled at me for this religion thing. But you gave this nurse the benefit of the doubt because she is a woman. Umm, I swallowed my anger. Suppose two goddess did the same bad thing. One is ugly, the other one is pretty. What do you think of more excuses were? Same for both. I'm afraid, that for myself, I would blame the ugly one. You are strange! The truth is, that when I got to the Accounting Office, I was mad. But the anger lasted only a few seconds. Yes, and then you fell apart. So this attack came on because I'm afraid to hurt the nurse? Not with the front part of your mind. With the back of my mind. Two factors : The fear that you could hurt women... and the fear that they could hurt you. Remember, to be angry is good. Relapses are good! Life will still happen to you. Later on if ever the headache comes back, figure it out. I know myself better than anyone else does. You taught me that. Soldier Picard! Well? Can we have the next dance? So you remembered my address? Well, I was walking around and... just like that, came back to me. Well, fancy that! - Oh, that's nice. - Hand made with my hands. I like you. You're gentle, you don't play tough! Don't bet on it, sweetheart. You don't seem that crazy to me. Nope. So, after you get out of the bug-house, you want to stay around? Maybe I'll head to Seattle. There are lots of Indians up there. - Work the shipyards. - Shipyards? And tonight. You gonna stay around? No way, young lady. - Are you sure? - Yup. Well... it's taking him quite a while to calm down. Mr. Picard. We are here to discuss the results of your treatment. Jimmy, do you have any thoughts you'd like to share with us? I don't know what to say. The symptoms originally presented by the patient, have probably vanished. Yes, and we're all happy to see how much insight Jimmy has gained. At Mr. Devereux request a neurosurgeon and I will perform one last procedure. Hello Jim, if the oxy-encephalogram goes without a hitch, you'll be on the train home next Thursday. Fellows, if these walls could only talk. You have both come a long way. And we had to dig down deep. - Jimmy? - Yes, sir... I've been thinking. You seem to have learned so much here at Winter. I think you'd make a big psychiatric aide! Would you consider staying on with us? Well, I... I need to spend some time at home, first. Go on. Sure. Just keep it in mind. We are very proud. I feel like all my complexes have disappeared. "Complexes"? Where did you pick up that word? Oh, I think you said so. Maybe Dr. Holt. No, I never use that word! I'm afraid of big word. Homely words bring things closer. Would it help to have a name for what ailed you? Well, if there's no word, you can make up one. Actually we have a word. "Psychic Trauma." It's a Greek word. It just means: "soul pain." My friend, your soul was in pain. You know, last week I went downtown. And I met that girl. I figure I tried myself out. - Did you made love? - Yes. - So, no trouble in the penis department? - Oh, no. That's terrific.! Are you going to see this girl again? She's nice, she's a Pawnee. But I'd better stay away from her. I have the results. You don't have a cholesteatoma. You are in perfect health. That's great. Oh, that's great. You seem sad. I'm glad I met you. You kept your promises. Thank you. I am glad we got together. What will you do when you get back? I will go see Mary Lou. You should come visit. We could go horseback riding. We got lakes at the top of the mountains with... fish in it. You would like the scenery. I might just come one day. It would be a nice trip. My friend, remember your name. Ohonita-he-Puyope. "Everybody talks about him." Any one who's at peace with himself is at peace with others. You have a good memory, doctor. Very good. We had a nice talk. Good evening. Do you miss Madeleine? No. She has her life in Paris. Topeka, was just sort of... delightful holiday. And Menninger has offered me tenure. I heard. It's what I wanted. You will miss your patient? Of course. He didn't want to see you to the station. No. Do you feel guilty? Oh no. No, I don't feel guilty for America's crimes against the Indians. I'm only responsible to myself for what I myself do. I rejected communion of the saints as well as the communion of evil. I didn't help Jimmy Picard because he was an Indian, but because it was in my power to help him. What happened between Jimmy and myself concerns only us. It was between two men of good will, looking for common ground. Surely, we are different! All men rejoice differently. But still we should all sit down to the God's banquet. You're not looking at me. Yeah, I'm looking at you. - Are you angry? - I didn't know... if you would visit me one day. I've been missing you. You know, I wrote to your grandmother and asked her about adopting you. Did you know that? I knew. I thought about it for a long time. And I think it could be a good idea. So I came here to talk it over with you. Okay. JIMMY P. Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian based on "Reality and Dreams" by Georges Devereux
