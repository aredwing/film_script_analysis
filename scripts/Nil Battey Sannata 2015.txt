Don't go without freshening up'? Take a bath and pray before you leave. Only God can save you this time. Your lunch-boat's is in the bag. Don't forget to pack it. What did you make? Eggplant Eggplant, on the first day? You could've made potatoes. Vacations are over, and now this. Wouldn't you love to stay home all day" ..and eat potatoes? Wh! Keep this. 10 rupees? I am a grownup now. No. You've become lazy. Keep this too. Why name me Apeksha? What does that mean? It starts with an A. So my name comes first during roll call. Couldn't you think of a name with Z. That would've given me another 10 minutes. So change your name. Call yourself 'Zandu Balm'. Go carefully. And Wakeup. Sazia. Appu's awake, but I don't trust her. Please check on her once. Today it's the first day of the new class. O Lord... Goddess Sheravali.. Sai Baba.. (saint). Appu's in class 10 this year. Please save her. Please. Save me from Math. Good morning, ma'am. You're here . You're never late . Oh ho... Keep tea for boiling. - Yes. "Oh lord give me the strength.." "..so I could fulfill my rightful duties. "By helping and serving others.." "..We may make our life successful. "By helping and serving others.." "..We may make our life successful. "Those who are in pain and crippled, may we serve and relieve their pain" "Those who are in pain and crippled, may we serve and relieve their pain.." Sweaty, how Were the holidays? Amazing. Look at him staring at us. Over-smart principle . Where is Pintu? I don't know. When-is he going? Hello, ladies. Welcome, boy. Did your daughter, Appu, go to school, I hope so. Who'd know if she's gone somewhere else. She's a big pain. I wonder what she'll do in future. I am getting grey hair worrying about her. I just noticed this morning. Here and here . Really? What do I make for you? I want to eat stuffed bread today. You know, I've decided. I'll learn some English. Later, I'll move to Mumbai and drive a taxi. Why learn English if you Want to drive a taxi? Not the common ones. The one with A/C! Only rich people use that to commute. And one mole thing. You also get a uniform to Wear, along with a cap. Yes. - Come on. And, Sweaty, What about you? What ab out her. She'll get married in four years. - Yes. And until then, she has her daily soaps to keep her company. What's the principle doing here'? He teaches Math to class 10. Oh no...as if math Wasn't enough, and now him? Double headache. Look. Look at him. Bloody smarty pants. He's all charged up. Children, finally you've managed.. .to get to class 10. And just like, one can predict. ..what a kid will grow up to be. Similarly, your class 10 results determine" ..who is a winner, and who is.. Loser. Children, every minute, hour.. ..and second this year is priceless for all of you. Those who use it wisely, will be the" - Winner. And those who waste it... - Loser. So, children, what do you want to be'? Winner. Say it loud. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Winner. Very good. Now math. Little island. What is...? Huh? You should never make pickles by the recipes given in books. Why not? My grandma used to say, pickles are made.. "I like myself". "How do you feel about you". "Oh life". How was your first day? Same class, same hooks. Same class, same hooks? Didn't they promote you to class 10'? Of course I was promoted to class 10. 9th or 10th, what difference does it make'? Just the books get a little thicker. Yeah, but you must have new teachers'? Yes. We did. Ranbir Kapoor for Maths. ...and Salman Khan for Physics. "How fat is the fat destination". "The house is just at the next junction". "Kept inside the cup, covered". "There is so much salt and sugar". "I may not find the moment of my size". " What kind of a tailor is Tittle". "Measuring anyone with the past". "Who is wrong, whose mistake it is". "Took off from the earth". "A flight". "Your heaven is up there". "Oh life". "Oh life". Pintu's really lucky . Soon he'll become a driver, like his father. Yeah! What a great achievement! What will you do? Did you ever give it any thought? Mom, once you start, you don't to stop. Then the cost of one sweet was twenty-five paisa. Ma'am, buttermilk. "The inflation too is high! Wow! Oh no... What happened? - Stop sticking your nose in the glass. Brother, pack one bread-sweet! Ma'am, I Want to ask you something. - What? Studying Medical and engineering.. ..must be really expensive, right'? Not when I used to study. That's how I became a doctor. But now. . .education has become more of a business. It costs somewhere around 500,000 to 1 million. At some places, the fee is between 2 to 5 million. That was really fun! Who gave the sweet? Uncle Mansoor did. His son got a job. As a peon. They are also throwing a party tomorrow. Who celebrates for a peon's job? Stupid people. Government job, 8000 salary. Think about it. 8000 rupees! Government job. Uncle Manson's really lucky. Appu. Appu. Hmm? What do you Want to he? Tell me, dear... ...you must have thought something. What's to think? Tell me. I will be a maid. What? What? What will you he? Maid? A engineer's son becomes an engineer... ..and a doctor's son, becomes a doctor. What else can a maid's daughter he? Maid. It's that simple. I'll give you a tight slap. Is this Why I've been slugging around? Am I sending you to school so that you can he a maid? Do you know What it means to he a maid? Listen carefully, Appu, and remember. No matter what happens, you won't become a maid. Did you get that? Did I say something wrong'? Do you Want one? Mother. Mom! It's not that maids don't have a future. These rich people, need a maid.. ..to look after their kids. And...they call them maid. They are called Nanny. Nanny or granny! If you say it again, I'll slap you silly. You can't do a single chore around the house.. ..and dream to he a maid. The children in this country.. ..have no freedom to decide their career. Come. Give it here . What's wrong'? Couldn't sleep last night? What do I say? I am totally confused. Maybe I can help. Tell me. Appu Wants to he a maid. Maid? Why? Because I am one. That isn't right. Isn't it. I said the same thing. Some logic about engineer's son becomes a engineer... ..so, a maid's daughter will he a maid. Then Abdul Kalam should've been a fisherman. Because his father was a fisherman. Then What did he become? Stop eating your hail. First he became a renowned scientist. Later...India's President. Means...Rahstrapati (President) She knows that. Who? The one with the long hair. Now I remember. Even Salman Khan was sporting the same hairstyle.. ...in 'Tere Naam'. The movie was a big success. All the boys in my neighborhood copied his hairstyle. But not my husband. He didn't have such habits. But, his daughter is very fashionable. Chanda, people find success through two things. Luck or hard work. That's true. And if poor people were lucky.. ..they wouldn't be poor, right? True. So what's left is hard work. That's What she'll have to do. That's the problem, sister. Appu doesn't want to do hard work. She never listens . She's all grownup now, but stubborn as hell. If this continues, I don't ..she'll even clear her class 10 exams. No, Chanda. She will have to clear her class 10 at any cost. Let me Warn you. If she fails in 10th, she will stop studying. I've seen many such kids. You Were one of them too. Take this off, and take those. Keep this one outside too. I was thinking about What you said.. ..about your daughter yesterday. Why do you think she Won't pass her exams? Some learning disability.. Mrs. Deewan. You didn't show up yesterday. I Wasn't in the mood. Does she have dyslexia or something.. What? What film was that... Yes, 'Tame Zameen Pat'. No, ma'am. She's not stupid. In fact she's over smart. Always interested in other things Happening around her. And she scores decent marks in other subjects. Well, at least she passes. Just this Math. That's What troubles her. Oh... Gills have an old enmity with Math. If only we can solve this problem.. I think We should get her extra tuitions. Don't Worry about money. I know Mr. Gupta. He runs a coaching classe. Will you talk to him? We should also check for dyslexia. I doubt... - Ma'am, she's got none of those. She's just stubborn, that's all. So Mrs. Deewan's sent you. Yes. What were your daughter's scores in class 9'? 47%. And Math. She barely passed in Math. Would you like some tea? Look, Chanda. The thing about coaching classes are.. ..we offer discount to students with marks above 75%. But, sit, don't Weak students need coaching, Absolutely right. But coaching classes need good results. Which We get only from above avenge students. And if they're already good.. ..than, they don't need us. So We've to give them discount. Since Mrs. Deewan's sent you.. ...I'll give you a special offer. If yor daughter, scores more than 50%.. ..in her pre-board exams.. Then I'll give you 50% discount for the clash course. Okay? Goodbye. Come, dance with me. Let's do it. Sit here . See you guys tomorrow. To get you educated, I sob floors, day night. And, here you are enjoying and having a chat? Why didn't you come home in the afternoon? I had to eat noodles. Appu, did you heat What I said? This T.V has made life hell here. Better to kill this T.V. You say this every day. Mrs. Deewan had a wold with MI. Gupta.. ...for your Math tuitions. And he's prepared to give you a discount. But, first you need to score at least 50%.. Your pro-board exams. And you will do it. At any cost, get that. Mom. Have you lost your mind? What's the point in clearing.. ..my SSC exams. And even if I do it, do you have the money.. ..to pay for my further education'? I'll end up as a maid. So What good is education? Say that again and I'll break your teeth. You and your stupid logic. No brains, and all crap. And what's this language you're using'? You've lost all manners too. Who Were you calling crazy? Wh! I will arrange for the money that's not the problem. But scoring 50% in pro-board.. ..seems too fit-fetched for her. Looking at Appu's attitude" ...I feel they'll fail her in her semester exams. Yesterday I took a peak in her books. I couldn't understand a word. It used to be easier before. But everything's in English now. You know...if I could understand... ..Then, I would've definitely tutored her. But my position in Math is 'Nil Battey Sanaata'. What? It's a proverb . Used for someone Who's beyond help. Well, what a proverb! What if you get a chance to study again'? Will you teach me? My position in Math is 'Nil Battey Sanaata' too. Wonderful. It's like had luck all the Way. I can't teach her or get her tuitions. Will you go hack to school? What? Will you go hack to school? Yes, let's go. Why don't we both go together? We'll trouble the teachers. I am not joking. What will I do in school? What will I do in school? Make pickles. Study, and teach your daughter. No, this isn't done. You're sounding absurd. This isn't a film, its reality. So What was all the commotion about? Well, there's no tax on raising a commotion. So I did it too. And anyway, who would give me admission at this age? Don't Worry about that? Do you Want to? Chanda, let's go. We're getting late.. Thanks. Going hack to school at this age could he so humiliating. And What happens when Appu becomes a maid? Look, school ends in the afternoon. Tuck it in. That means I'll have to shift my job.. ..at the spice factory an hour later. That means I'll arrive...an hour late at the shoe factory. They will definitely clobber me there. Aren't you done with the pins'? Chanda, Do I look good? And if I go back to school". ...I'll have to pay for the uniform, school fee, hooks. ..pens, pencils, commuting" - Coming. Like "The dough is runny in poverty". Close all the windows and doors before you leave. What happened? I forgot that. If I start going to school.. ...I'll have to come an hour earlier at your home? What than? That means We'll have to Wake up an hour earlier. What if I fail myself? Won't that he terrible? Are you carrying the envelope? - Yes. Look, Chanda, if it's so difficult. ..then don't get into this mess. Let her become a maid. Shall We? Close the door.. - Close it. Are you okay? Why? Nothing. I used to your chattering. That's Why I asked. You know, I think you should join Appu's school. Appu's school? Sister.. Private school fee are too high. There must be other government schools. If you join Appu's school, her class.. ..she'll make less mistakes. Right? Secondly, you will know.. ..what problems she is facing. Right? Appu will kill me. Bye. See you. Bye. It will he flue. Let's go meet his principle. What's his name? Srivastav. Get my phone, I'll fix an appointment. Ma'am, you didn't have to take the trouble. You should've just sent the student. It's a delicate situation. Its flue. Call her, I'll speak with her. Who? The student? Yes. Chanda. She's Chanda... Oh my, I forgot your surname. Sakai. - Sahay. Chanda Sahay. Hello.

And, no matter how stupid the child is.. ..the mother has an attachment. And I can't lose hope either. Sir, coaching classes are expenses... ...and, they don't accept dimwits either. I thought, if I can study myself. ...I might be able to tutor her too. Who knows...there might be.. ..one less dimwit in your school. No one will know she's my daughter. And I Won't give you a reason to complain. I sweat. I Won't give you an opportunity. I respect your thought. I mean...I respect her sentiments. But..this is a government school. Isn't this your interview? Yes, it's your picture. Yes. Better Late Than Never. - Yes. So.. The awakening that came in 94, December... Even your government says.. ..educate girls, help country progress. Yes . - Right? Treat it like an experiment. By the way, you two have surrounded me. But, madam..this is a legal matter. So, I'll have to talk to my senior. - Of course. It's a special case. - Yes. Can I make a call? It's your phone, sir. Yes. Yes, it's done. I'll come hack and tell you. He Wants to know What Srivastav said. What now? Why are you sulking now? What are you thinking? What will Appu think? Are you insane'? Or lost your mind? You should've thought about my respect'? How could the Principal allow you in school? He doesn't own the place? Look, if you join school, then I'll quit for good. Who gave you such a miserable idea? Okay... You Want me to concentrate on my studies, don't you? I'll do it. I'll start studying right now. I'll score better marks in the next test. Please, mom. Don't come to school. All my friends will mock me. They will humiliate me. I'll he a laughing stock! Please, mom. Fine, I Won't come. I Won't Watch television either. Or go out to play. I'll study hard. I'll go study.

Ma'am, your newspaper. You've school. How was your first day? - How else? All the kids Were staring at me, like.. ...I was committing a sin, and was caught red-handed. And everyone was staring at me with awe. I was feeling so ashamed. That's flue. But how was your first day? Other subjects were fine. But Math... Curse this Math. I couldn't understand a thing. And you know, ma'am. It seemed like Math class was never-ending. Now you can understand poor Appu's situation. Do you find Math easy? No. I find it interesting. Who will explain this? Pintu, you do it. I'll explain it once I understand. Son, for that you'll have to work hard. And that's difficult for you. You can prepare for a hattrick in your exams. Sit! Weak Sin cos tita + tan cos tati = one, my son. Sin cos tita- tan cos tita = cos 2 tita. One plus one does not equal eleven, my son. All the subjects, except math We are dull.

No, right. Looking at you...Im sure.. ..you don't think about the future. If you study hard, and be successful. ..then others will imitate you. Have you ever thought that? Appu, come here. Chanda Sahay. You deserve a mark mole for your efforts. "I am your enemy." Children... There are two children who are praiseworthy. First is. . .Chanda Sahay. She started late but caught up. And she passed with good marks in this unit test. Very good, Chanda. Keep it up. And the other is... Apeksha, will you please come here? Apeksha... She's fulfilled my expectations.

Let her come. Are you satisfied now? That grouch was humiliating me.. ..and you Were laughing. No, Appu. I didn't laugh at all. I sweat. Everyone was laughing. I noticed you Were too. Why will anyone laugh if you pass your exams. Save your preaching for Sweaty and Pintu. Don't show attitude because you passed. You're just a maid! I see. You're not upset that you failed. In fact, you're upset because.. ..that a maid exceeded you. Wonderful, Appu. Bravo . So. . .why shouldn't I'? You stole my friends too. I didn't steal your friends. They feel ashamed to he with you.

And now you Want to assert your dreams on me. I am going to school, that's mole than enough. And anyway, you don't have the money to send me to college? Nor am I interested. You're joking, Appu.

And sweet corn soup. And... chocolate cake. Take. - Should I pout? Appu, where were you'? Why didn't you show up in the afternoon? I had kept money in the sugar jar. Did you see them? Where were you'? Where's the money? What's this? What is this? You stole the money. I pardoned all your mistakes. ..and you robbed your own house. I don't have the money to educate you. I had saved that money with great difficulty. And you spent all of it in one day. It Wasn't your hard earned money. What did you say? Say that again. I've seen the guy who drops you everyday. That was all I had to heat! You think I'm pg myself? I'm pg myself? I slog all day and night for you. I break my back working for you, but you think I p myself. Aren't you ashamed'? Is that What you say? You stole my money and yelling at me instead. Bh You didn't do any favor to me. Why don't you just die? It'll he an end to all my trouble. You're trouble, nothing mole. You think this is a joke. Three months rent, Ration, school fees.. ..how are We going to pay for all that? I don't care. Appu, you... You can't even become a maid, Appu. You can do anything you like. You can rot in hell, as if I care. I Won't say a thing. And forgive me for thinking about your interest. It was my fault. Chanda Sahay. Yes, sir. Chanda. Yes, sir. Roll no.33? Yes. Where'is Chanda? Yes, I miss her. Her or her pickles? Both. Everyone will write an essay on this tomorrow. Everyone will write on their own. No one's going to copy. And everyone will have to read out.. "Their essay in flout of the entire class. Understand. My dream is to become a driver. You call that a dream. Sweety, everyone will laugh at me. Who told you to have such a lowly dream? I didn't know We'll have to write an essay unit. By the Way, Sweaty, What are you going to Write? Don't know. Appu, What are you going to Write? Paupers don't have the right to dream. Frankly, those who don't have a dream, are really poor. Roses are poor I don't know a thing. I mean...you must be the only gill in the world.. ..who has a dream. Take it. Take it. See. . Jay new style. How is it? Nice. Look. Nice. What's wrong, Appu? Say something. Why are you so quiet? What's on your mind, Appu? We followed in your footsteps. ..and made it to first bench. And you..slipped hack to square one. You know... everyone working really hard.. ..preparing for the pre-board exams. And you're sulking here. Appu. Let's go, Sweaty. What's going on? What do you care? Where's Chanda? I don't know. Why ask me? You know Why. I know everything, but you don't. What? What do you know? That she's your mother. Then you must know where she's been going these days. Yes, I do. Appu, you have too many questions. But you never tried to find the answers. Remember what I said. The answers are hidden in the question. Where are you going'? We'll meet at Delhi Gate at 8:30. Boss. I'll he right hack. - Be hack soon. Do you know why she works at a place like this? For you. You never expected anything from yourself. And she never stopped expecting. I don't know Why, but she still thinks.. ..that you'll score 50% marks in the pro-boards. And she'll need money to Enroll you in coaching classes. She isn't asserting her dreams on you. You are her dream, Appu. That...is my elder brother. Your scooter guy. Pankaj. Even he has expectations from me. At least I won't shatter his hopes. You must he hungry. Wait, I'll make something. How is it? Let it be. It's best you don't cook. Eat it. I Want to sleep. You eat. - No, I don't Want to. You will stop going at the restaurant from tomorrow. Where will we get the money'? We'll see about that. But you won't go there. Fine, dear, I won't go there. Happy'? And you'll come to school. What's the point? Just like you don't Want your daughter to ..even I don't Want... ...my mother to he a failure all her life. Sit. It's Chanda ma'am herself Madam, thank you. Finally you found time to come to school. I mean...what an ideal class this is. One's not interested in attending. Another's not interested in dreaming. Chanda, you Wasn't here.. ..so We couldn't know What your dreams are. So would you like to tell the class? Yes? Tell us...or stand outside. Come on! If you stay with such oafs, you'll all become fools. Can I tell you, sir? You don't have a dream of your own? Can you tell me hers'? If Chanda didn't have dreams.. ..then she wouldn't come to school and listen to your taunts. She works all day, gets tiled. But still comes to school. The poor gill doesn't even get an off on a Sunday. Because..maids don't have a Sunday. But still on a Monday... she's present in class. With a big smile on her face She doesn't care about the scorching heat or the rains. Nor makes an excuse about any illness. Do you know Why, sir? Because she has just one dream. Next time her daughter tells the class.. ..that she has a dream. Go on. Sit down! You know, there's nothing wrong in failing. Really? What's wrong is admitting Defeat without trying. Always I remember one thing. Your dream is only yours. Lot of people will laugh on your dream. Ask them to go to hell. They can't snatch your dream. There are few people.. ..who will understand your dream. Keep them close. They will keep your dream alive. You will face difficulties on the way. That's for sure . But always I remember one thing. If you have your dream in your sights. ...no difficulty will last for too long. Just don't let your Dreams out of your sight. Do you know Why? Because if there's anything we have to progress in life.. ...it's...our dreams. And no one can snatch it from us. Apeksha Sahay. Most gills don't choose Math. But you chose Math fol your UPSC exams. And excelled in it too. That's commendable. I would like to give Credit to my mother for that. What does your mother do? She gives Math tuitions to poor kids. For free. Good. Apeksha, Why do you Want to he IS? Because... ...I don't Want to he a maid! "Your every scolding was of care". "Every wold that you said was fol me". "Your every scolding was of care".
