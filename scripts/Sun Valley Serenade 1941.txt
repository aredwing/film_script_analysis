You got a lot of colour in your left cheek this morning. - A little something to remember us by. - That's awfully nice of you. - Don't mention it. - Yeah, don't. Any chance of Mr Murray listening to the band? Sorry, I haven't been able to get you an appointment. Couldn't you sneak us in? I'd like to, but Mr Murray isn't considering anything but a big-name band for Sun Valley. (woman singing) Hey, that's Vivian Dawn. - Isn't she wonderful? - Wonderful? Why, she's... Yeah, wonderful. And a twinkle in your eye I remember, oh so clearly I didn't know her eyes were blue. I always figured they were kind of hazel. Oh, get her off your mind, will you? He's been dreaming about her for days. That's the kind of girl I dream about. But not the kind I get. - So divine... - (brass section breaks in very loudly) It happened in Sun Valley Not so... Not so... Stop! Stop it! (music stops) Jimmy, at rehearsals I asked you not to do that. - I'm playing it the way I arranged it. - Well, I'll sing it the way I sing it! Now just a minute... - What happened? - She didn't follow the music. The leader crossed her up. Who are they auditioning, the band or me?! This band is just as... - Miss Dawn! - Now try to sell your band! - Miss Dawn... - Yes? I think you're right. Any leader that would do that deserves to be walked out on. - Well, thank you. - May I help you on with your coat? - Miss Dawn, I'm terribly sorry. - I'm sure it wasn't intentional. If he'd put his foot out and tripped her, it couldn't have been more deliberate. - I beg your pardon, who are you? - He don't know us?! How are ya? This is Ted Scott, Phil Corey and the Dartmouth Troubadours. - I'm their manager, Jerome K Allen. - How do you do? Miss Dawn, won't you continue your audition? I wouldn't sing another note with Jimmy Norton's band if... Not even if... - Can you play "Sun Valley"? - I can get a copy in ten minutes. - What music have you? - "The Anvil Chorus" to "Beat Me, Daddy". Look at this. I know your style, and that's right up your alley. Look at this. I know your style, and that's right up your alley. I mean, it's your type. If Mr Murray would like to continue with this band, I'm ready. By all means, Miss Dawn. ( "Moonlight Serenade") ( segues into "I Know Why (And So Do You)") Why do robins sing in December Long before the springtime is due? And even though it's snowing Violets are growing I know why and so do you Why do breezes sigh every evening Whispering your name as they do? And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling? I know why and so do you When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins When you dance with me I'm in heaven when the music begins I can see the sun when it's raining I can see the sun when it's raining Hiding every cloud from my view And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms? I know why and so do you When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins When you dance with me I'm in heaven when the music begins I can see the sun when it's raining Hiding every cloud from my view And why do I see rainbows When you're in my arms? I know why and so do you I know why And so do you - Thank you, Miss Dawn. Very good. - Thank you. I want to talk to you a minute. That's a grand arrangement. Who did it? Modestly, I did. But it never sounded as well as when you sang it. Modestly, thank you. - Make a deal with Miss Dawn. - And the band? As long as we have her, we don't have to worry about a name. (both) Thank you, Mr Murray. Mr Murray, thank you. You couldn't have made a better decision. It's men like you that make this country what it is. When do we open? Christmas Eve. But have your band at Sun Valley a week before. Christmas Eve - that's five weeks from today. Mr Murray, if this deal wasn't all set and you weren't entirely satisfied... In a strictly professional way, how about a $500 advance? You're a little short, huh? No, money's the last thing I think of - before I go to bed. We've been doing pretty good lately. We're well heeled. We... Tell you what. Carmen Miranda's closing at the Lido Terrace. I'll book you in there until it's time to leave for Sun Valley - if Miss Dawn is agreeable. She's agreeable. The Persian Room at four? Isn't that a little early? We'd be the only ones there. Isn't that a little early? We'd be the only ones there. What's wrong with that? Nothing. - Bye. - Bye. Gee, thanks, Mr Murray. You'll never regret it. Oh, boy, are we sitting pretty! Have we got the world by the tail! Honey, get yourself a Hershey bar. With almonds. We made it. We're all set. We open next week at the Lido Terrace. Cigarettes on me. Did I ever let you down? Nifty Allen never lets you down. Is there a Ted Scott around here? - Why, yes. Who's calling? - Uncle Sam. Lido Terrace, Sun Valley and, who knows, right to the top. - Mr Allen, will you come here a minute? - Yeah, honey. There's a man here to see Ted Scott. Uncle Sam. Glad to see you. Any relative of Teddy's is a friend of mine. Come in. - I've had a hard job locating you fellas. - Good timing. We just closed a big deal. - I'm glad to hear you're working. - You? Me too. - I'm glad to hear you're working. - You? Me too. Hey, Ted, look who's here. Your Uncle Sam. - I haven't any Uncle Sam. - We all have an Uncle Sam. Did you forget to register for the draft? It can't be income tax - we had none. - This is for you, Mr Scott. - A subpoena server! If you had your life to live over again, don't do it. - That Brooklyn dame must've believed you. - Open it. Here. You open it. It's from the lmmigration Department. They're giving you a refugee. - A what? - A refugee. - A little baby. - That publicity stunt you cooked up for us. Almost got us ajob. Remember the play Winchell gave it? "Dartmouth Troubadours to adopt a little refugee tot." - It arrives on the George Washington. - What'll we do with it? Don't look at me. You signed the application. Just because I'm the only guy that had a pen, you're not gonna shove this off on me. Besides, we don't need publicity now. We'll tell 'em we don't want the baby. You can't. You're responsible - says so here. Then we'll find it a place to live and all chip in... Wait. What'll Winchell say? He gave us a big build-up about sharing our laughter and tears with a little refugee. What'll he say if he finds out we tied a can to it? You can't keep him from knowing - not even when you're gonna have a baby. - Figure it out. - You figure it out. - Didn't you tell me you wanna be a father? - Yeah, but I wanna do it my way. (man) Number 23. - 23? That's us, dear. - You wait here, honey. - Number 23, officer. - Right here, sir. - Hello, sonny. - God dag. Welcome to America. This is great. Nothing pulls publicity like a baby or a dog. Look at that. Betty Jean, this is your new brother, Charles. - Hello. - Isn't he sweet? - You gotta admit that's pretty cute. - (man) Number 36. Where's the paper? Suppose he called our number and we muffed it? - What number did he say? - Number 36. Bingo! Boys, get ready with the introduction. Come on, you guys, get the cameras set. (jolly tune) - Here you are, number 36. Where is it? - Right here. (music falters / flat bass note) - 36? That must be her chest measurement. - Give me that. I said I'd take a child, I didn't say I'd take a... Well, she's too big for her age. Is that your signature? She's a refugee like the rest, and here you guarantee to take care of her and that she'll not become a public charge. She's your responsibility now, mister. Young lady. She's your responsibility now, mister. Young lady. This gentleman is your sponsor. - How are you? - How do you do? Hold it. Let's see more of your face, Scott. - That's the way we greet friends in Norway. - What a country! My name is Jerome K Allen. - Come over here. - How do you do, Mr Allen? Number 41. - Now let's get this straightened out... - I have something to say to you. I am so happy to be here. Words cannot express how much I appreciate your kind and noble act... noble act... I studied English in Oslo. ..your noble act of being sponsor to me, a homeless refugee. I should always try to repay your kindness. I thank you. That was beautiful. You know... - Now look, Miss... - Karen Benson. You didn't get your number mixed up, did you? Number mixed? Oh, no. Why? You see, I was expecting kind of a... Well, sort of a... About that size. Oh, I see. But the refugees' numbers are selected as the applications come in. You never know who you'll get. You got me. Don't you like me? - It's not that... - We're crazy about you. We got the nursery all set, with dolls and prunes and spinach... What am I saying? Grab her bags, Nifty. Let's get out of here. - Did you have a nice trip over from Sweden? - Yes. From Norway. Pardon me. I keep forgetting. That's the Empire State Building. You're very young to have a wife and three children. Where did you get that idea? - Haven't you? - Well, not yet. Oh, then you're single. Perhaps it'll be a burden to have one more mouth to feed. No, nothing to worry about. - Oh, then you're rich? - Well, I wouldn't say that, but... I'm glad you are - with so many relatives living in your house you need a lot of money. Relatives? I haven't any relatives. It won't be any trouble to keep house just for you and me. - Look... - I'm a good housekeeper. I can cook and sew and darn socks and everything. Would you take it easy... (siren) Air raid! Air raid. Oh. - Is this my room? - Yeah, but I'll have all this stuff taken out. Oh, it's beautiful! - Hello. How are you? - How do you do, Mr Scott? - Where's the little refugee? - Well... I am the little refugee. - Well, you see how it is. - I most certainly do. And if you think I'll be a party to any such arrangement as this, you're mistaken. - What's the matter with her? - Nothing. Make yourself at home. - It's going to be very pleasant for us here. - Only one of us. I'll live upstairs. - Why? - Well, I... Goodbye! (door slams) Look, Karen, we have to think about your future and make plans. - I have plans made already. - You have? What are they? Find a man I like and get married. Isn't that what every girl should do? Well, sure, but what I meant was... Well, what did you do in Sweden? I mean Norway. Look for a man. Only I didn't find anyone I liked. Didn't you ever think of pounding a typewriter or working in a beauty salon? No. My father was a schoolmaster. I kept house for him. I'm a good cook, you know. But when the war came, first I lost my father and then I lost my house. That's too bad. - You want me to learn beating a type... - Skip it. Forget it. Look, I have to run along. We're playing at the Lido Terrace downstairs. So long. If you want anything, just... call on the phone and charge it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I'll see you later. - Goodbye. (whistles) ( "In the Mood") (sotto section) (even quieter) (returns to full volume) - Oh, you were wonderful! - Well, thanks. But how did you get in here? I just told the man at the door I was living with you, so he brought me here. That's all. - Anything wrong? - No, no. Nothing. - Have you had your dinner? - Yes. But I could hear you playing and I just had to see you, because I've made up my mind. - You have? - And nothing will ever change it. I've found him. - Found who? - The man I'm going to marry. Already? Gee, that's wonderful. I'm sure you'll be very happy. Oh, you will be too. You'll make a wonderful husband. Thanks. I'm... What?! - It's you. - Me? Now wait a minute... I was sure of it when I first saw you, and just now when you played, I knew I was right. Listen, honey... I said to myself, "He's been so wonderful to you. That's how you can repay him." That's a very nice thought, but you don't have to carry it that far. Maybe in Norway they marry to pay off the mortgage, but not here. You get married because you want to... well, because you're in love. I am in love. Look, you're a very sweet kid, but you just imagine you're in love with me. - Besides, I have a girl. - Only one? Only one, and I happen to be very fond of her. - But you're not married yet. - No, but... Then there's time to change your mind. - Well, hello. - Hello, Vivian. This is Karen Benson, who I told you about. Miss Dawn. - How do you do? - I'm delighted. I'm so glad Ted brought you down tonight. Ted, she's much prettier than she looked in that newspaper picture of you greeting her. - Sit down, dear. - Thank you. I suppose I'll be one more to ask that original question: how do you like New York? I think I could like it very much. Oh, she will. She hasn't had a chance to see much yet, just the ride uptown. We'll have to do something about that. You'll be popular with your men friends, having such an attractive sightseer in tow. You'll be popular with your men friends, having such an attractive sightseer in tow. - Perhaps I should go along to protect Karen. - I don't need protection. Oh, are you going to keep Ted all to yourself? - Karen hasn't begun to think of such things. - Oh, yes, I have. Karen, you must be awfully tired. It's a long, tough trip from Sweden... I mean Norway. - Oh, I'm not tired at all. - I won't let him send you to bed. She doesn't want to miss all this pretty music. Do you, Karen? Come on, Ted, that's our cue. When I come back, we'll really get acquainted. Ted. Does she know how to cook? (knock at door) Here you are, honey. From me to you. Thanks, they're lovely. Won't you come in? How do you like America by now? Nice town, isn't it? (burst of rapid Norwegian) - What happened? - Could you get me that vase? Why didn't you say so? - Beautiful, ain't they? - Have you seen Ted? Where is he? He has to pack. The band's pulling out of here tonight. I'm gonna take you to meet my Aunt Rosie. Ted is packing? Where are we going? You're going to Weehawken to live with my Aunt Rosie. You'll love it. She's the sweetest woman. I'm not going with Ted? What would you do in Sun Valley where the snow's up to your neck? Snow? Is it like that? Every day, except when there's a blizzard. If it wasn't my duty, I wouldn't go. - Ted doesn't like snow either, does he? - Are you kiddin'? He has Eskimo blood. He shoots around on those turned-up bed slats like they were roller skates. And Miss Dawn, she likes to ski too? Her? You couldn't get her near an electric icebox. Then Ted would like me along. I'm good at skiing and skating, and he'll want company. Honey, this is not a vacation, this is work. Ted can't have you around with the band. He told me to tell you that... Oh... - Why did he have to wish this on me? - Why did he? Because he can't meet an issue face to face. You gotta look it right in the eye, right in the... If it was up to me, you'd be on that train. - Then why don't you take me? - I would, but... You're the manager, aren't you? Making the decision is up to you. - Yeah, but... - You are a strong man. If you decide to do anything, you do it, don't you? - Usually, sure. - If you really want to take me... Honey, the moment I saw you with those helpless refugees, I said to myself there's nothing you could ask that I wouldn't do. - What time does the train leave? - 11:35. But wait... It's out. It can't be done. Ted wouldn't stand for it. I know Ted. That's too heavy. Take this one. We gotta be strong. We gotta face the situation, look it right in the eye. - I am. - Yeah, that's what I said... Karen, will you be reasonable? Ted gets mad at the littlest... I wanna tell you about my Aunt Rosie. I'll take you to meet her when you and I come back from Sun Valley. What am I saying? Hello, Mr Scott. Miss Dawn, how do you do? Mr Corey. Welcome to Sun Valley. - What a place. - The sleighs are right over here. - This is going to be fun. - First time I was ever in one of these. - See you up at the lodge. - OK, Mr Murray. Say, when that coat has pups will you give me one? Don't mind her, boss. She meets all the trains. I think she's been kicked in the head by a pigeon. Come on, get me a steam-heated cab with a slow meter. Nifty? It's all right now, honey. You can come out. - Have you told Ted yet? - Not exactly. I'm waiting for the right time. - Have you told Ted yet? - Not exactly. I'm waiting for the right time. Think he'll be awfully angry? Are you kidding? I got him just where he wants me. This is wonderful. Yeah, if there's enough room in this taxi cab for both of us. Howdy, folks, let's go for a ride Get your favourite one to sit by your side Cuddle up in a sleigh Giddy-up, Nellie Grey And away we go While you listen to the sleigh bells ring, yodelling to your baby You'll feel nice and warm, no matter how cold it may be Take a look at little Jack and Jill They ski down a hill That's a snow plough - turn And look, there's a spill, there's a spill on the hill When you're down it's a thrill to go up again Everybody ought to learn to ski For that's how we first met We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill When I looked at you my heart took a spill Took a spill on a hill It's a thrill that I can't forget It happened in Sun Valley not so very long ago There were sunbeams in the snow And a twinkle in your eye I remember, oh so clearly That you nearly passed me by Then it happened in Sun Valley When you slipped and fell and so did I I remember, oh so clearly That you nearly passed me by Then it happened in Sun Valley When you slipped and fell and so did I Now every year we go back And then we recall that fall And that moment when we were there on a hill So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill... again Pardon me, could you spare ten cents for the Skiers' Aid Society? - There you are. - Thanks. - Say, I go for you. - You do? Haven't you got a boyfriend? - I got 18 boyfriends. - 18? All told? No, one kept his mouth shut. - Hiya, Nifty. - Hiya, Ted. - You happy? - Like a kid who broke a date with the dentist. Nothing could make you sore, huh? Nothing could come between us? Nothing... much. Say, what's this build-up for? Oh, not a thing. What could be wrong in a place like this? Oh, not a thing. What could be wrong in a place like this? What a day, what a day! The nights ain't bad either. This is magnificent. Come and look at the view. You look at it while I get dressed. Will you come out and look at this snow? It's as white as... - Snow. - Yeah. (phone rings) Hello? Oh, hello, darling. I was just waiting to hear the sound of your voice. Hey, lay off that phone and come out here, will you? Hey, Ted? Ted? Could you spare ten cents for the Skiers' Aid Society? - I just gave you ten cents. - Oh, so you're the fella. OK. - (knock at door) - Come in. - Like it? - Like it? You look beautiful. - Thank you. - But are those the shoes you're wearing? I like a tight clamp at the heel - gives better knee pressure. Imagine that. My skis are downstairs being waxed. Where are yours? Wait - you didn't really think I was going out there, sailing over the hills and dales? Wait - you didn't really think I was going out there, sailing over the hills and dales? - That's what you're dressed for, isn't it? - I've never skied in my life. But I can look the part. And if you teach me the words, I'll be able to talk a good game. Well, you're missing a lot of fun. Come on, let me take you to the beginners' slope. - After you get the hang of it, you'll be crazy... - That's right, I'd be crazy. But I don't want to spoil it for you. Go shoot the chutes. I'll find something else to do. - You're the swellest girl I ever met. - That's what I think of me too. Why don't you give in? Say yes and marry me. Aren't you afraid we'd spoil a beautiful friendship? There's only one way to find out. Suppose it didn't take? Suppose I got tired of you writing arrangements for breakfast, or you couldn't stand me singing scales for lunch? Be all right by me, as long as it was close harmony. - Well, let's practise a little longer. - Till when? Tomorrow? Don't tempt me. I might surprise you and say yes when you least expect it. Now run along and play. - Well, I hate to... - Yes, I know you do. Goodbye. OK. See you at rehearsal. - Gee, honey, you were great. - What happened? Where is he? - He didn't see you. He went skiing. - Skiing... Hey! Yell "track" when you wanna pass! Hey, look where you're going! What are you trying to do? So you wanna play games, huh? Well, I'll be... That did it! Hey, why don't you buy your own private mountain? You should be barred off the runs! You ought to know better than to do crazy stunts like that. Haven't you any sense? Somebody ought to take your skis and lock 'em up. Well? Haven't you anything to say for yourself? I hope you're satisfied. What's the... Hello. How did you get here? Didn't we have a wonderful chase? Let's do it again. Now just a minute... You're a wonderful skier. Your people must've come from Norway. Mm-hm. By way of Dublin. I picked it up when I was at college. - Now suppose you... - I learned it at kindergarten. Will you answer my question? How did you get here? - Oh, that? - Yes, that. Well... - Nifty didn't have anything to do with it. - Oh, so that's it. All he did was to tell me which train to take and lend me the money for the car fare and tell me where to hide so you wouldn't see me. That's all. That's all. I told that guy definitely... Do you realise the spot you've put me in? I'm responsible for you. Won't it be easier to be responsible for me here than in Weehawken? Yes, but people might get the idea that... It'd be different if you were a kid, but you're a grown girl. - What can we do about it? - Yeah, that's it. You're here now and I suppose I'll have to let you stay. But only for a few days, then you go to Nifty's aunt. After all, I've got work to do. I can't go skiing around the hills with you. I have to... Good night! - What's the matter? - I forgot about rehearsal. I bet I'll beat you. Take another look, Nifty. See if he's coming. I can't locate the guy. I don't know where he is. - Stall for time. - OK. "Chattanooga Choo Choo." Run it down again. Let's go. One, two... (train noises) (whistles) Hi there, Tex What you say? Step aside, partner, it's my day Bend and ear and listen to my version Of a really solid Tennessee excursion Pardon me, boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo? Yes, yes Track 29 Boy, you can give me a shine Can you afford to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo? I got my fare And just a trifle to spare You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore Dinner in the diner Nothing could be finer Than to have your ham and eggs in Carolina When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar Then you know that Tennessee is not very far Shovel all the coal in Gotta keep it rollin' Whoo, whoo Chattanooga, there you are There's gonna be a certain party at the station Satin and lace I used to call funny-face She's gonna cry Until I tell her that I'll never roam - So, Chattanooga Choo Choo - Won't you choo-choo me home? Chattanooga, Chattanooga... - All aboard - Chattanooga, Chattanooga... - Get aboard - Chattanooga, Chattanooga... Chattanooga Choo Choo Won't you choo-choo me home? Chattanooga Choo Choo - Pardon me, boys - Yes, yes? - Is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo? - That's the Chattanooga Choo Choo - On track 29 - 29? - That's on the Tennessee line - She said the Tennessee line She means that she can afford... I can afford to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo - What have you got in there? - I've got my fare - You say you have? - Uh-huh, but not a nickel to spare Well, I do declare You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore - Dinner in the diner - Nothing could be finer Than to have your ham and eggs in Carolina When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar Then you know that Tennessee is not very far Shovel all the coal in Got to keep her rollin' Oh, Chattanooga, there you are Chattanooga Choo Choo, there you are (applause) Boy, is she burning. What do you mean, burning? You could ski down the ice on her back. Ted'll be here any minute. A guy can get lost in those mountains - they all look alike. - You don't say. - Sure. In Switzerland sometimes they have to send snow hounds to find you. Ted might not be back for days. What am I saying? - Who's that with him? - I can't get over how white that snow is. - It's Karen! How did she get here? - Didn't you know? You took the same train. - Hello, everybody. - So you finally... - Look what I found sliding down a mountain. - Well, if it isn't Karen! I'm sorry I'm late. - Have a good time? - The snow was perfect. I'm glad you found someone to ski with so unexpectedly. - What do you think of her following us here? - What do you think of it? Come and say hello. Karen. - Hello, Vivian. - Hello, Karen. - Nifty, what's the idea of all the mystery? - What? Oh, Karen. Well, you had so much on your mind... I just couldn't leave her back there without me. - The great lover himself! - So romance walked in on snow shoes, huh? You should see her on skis. She could give an avalanche six lengths. Now I'll never see you, except at the piano. You'll have to go skiing with us. Karen could teach you - she knows all the tricks. Let's get this rehearsal over with. Yeah, Ted, if you don't mind. We've only been waiting a couple of hours. But I'll bet she can't cook. Oh... - Come on, let's go. - Wait a minute. - Now what's wrong? - Something's got hold of my foot. - You have one ski on top of the other. - Oh, that's right. - Hello. I got your message and here I am. - What message? Aren't you glad you came? It's a wonderful day for skiing. - Didn't you leave word to meet you up here? - I didn't know I was coming myself. That's funny. The clerk at the hotel said that... It is funny, isn't it? I'll race you to the bottom of the lift. - Race who? - Both of you. - Oh, no. - It's only the bottom of the run. - That's the trouble. - Here you go. Wait! Wait! Help! (yells) Calling Dr Kildare! Prepare for surgery! I'm snow-blind! I'm snow-blind! Hello, Round House? Is Mr Scott there? - Thank you. - Hello, Sun Valley. Just a moment. Hello, Trail Creek Cabin? Is Mr Scott there? Thank you. Sorry, Miss Dawn, I can't locate him. All right, thanks. Just forget it. (concertina music) In Sweden and in Norway they do the cutest dance When couples sentimentally inclined would really like to find romance They're playing a polka. In Sweden and in Norway, when concertinas play You sing hi-li, you sing hi-lo Your heart is young and gay With a yoom-papa and an oom-papa You take her hand and say Say, did you ever dance the kiss polka? You can steal a kiss to this polka She'll be shy when first you try Then by and by She'll say, "Yah, by yumping yiminy" You should always do the kiss polka When there is a lovely moon above It's a dance that you'll be wild about You kiss, kiss, kiss till you're all kissed out It's so much fun when it's done with the one you love - If they can dance it, we can. - Sorry, not my brand of music. - I can do the polka. - Then you dance with Ted. All right. Next one with you, dear. Say, did you ever dance the kiss polka? You can steal a kiss to this polka She'll be shy when first you try Then by and by She'll say, "Yah, by yumping yiminy" You should always do the kiss polka When there is a lovely moon above It's a dance that you'll be wild about You kiss, kiss, kiss till you're all kissed out It's so much fun when it's done with the one you love (music ends) - You gotta teach me that pretzel dance. - You'll have to learn it too, Vivian. - Is there any reason why we can't eat? - No. I'll order right away. - Waitress. - Yes, sir? We'll all have a Sauerbraten mit Spatzen, cheesecake und beer. How's that? Sounds terrible. I'll have a steak. - And, waitress, champagne. - Yes, ma'am. Whose birthday is it? In Norway we only have champagne at festivals or a wedding. Darling, you're psychic. I'm going to let you all in on a little secret. I've accepted Ted's proposal. We're getting married. (Nifty) I'll phone Winchell right away! No, after eight - it's cheaper. Congratulations. Maybe now you'll get your minds back on your work. - (Nifty) Why didn't you tip me off? - (Vivian) We decided to make it a surprise. After all, it's up to Vivian to say when. I want to congratulate you too. I wish you all the happiness in the world. Til lykke - that means good luck. Good luck - I hope so. Honey, why don't you give in too? We could have a double wedding - get a cut rate from the preacher and use the same rice. I couldn't without Ted's permission. He's responsible for me, you know. Well, he won't be much longer, dear - not after you're married. - Well, here's to us, Ted. - To us. - And to Karen. - And to Phil. - And to Nifty. - That's sweet. And to you, honey. Excuse me. Anyone planning to use the lift will have to be ready in 20 minutes. - They're only running it for one trip. - I'll get indigestion. Don't rush. It'll take quite a while to accommodate all these people. No, you and Phil and Nifty will have it all to yourselves. But how will you get down? A skier never takes a lift unless he's on a stretcher. It's an old Norwegian tradition. Haven't you had enough skiing for one day? It isn't that. Everyone would think he's a svekling - that means a softie. There you are. We'll meet you at the lodge. Too bad I didn't bring my skis. You and I could shoot around, do those flying jumps... - And you would come down on a stretcher. - Sure, I'd come down on a... Pass the biscuits, please. Better keep this around you. - I'm worried about you skiing after dark. - Oh, there's a swell moon out. That's what I'm worried about. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. See you at the lodge, Ted. - It's a beautiful night for skiing, isn't it? - I'll say it is. Ted! Will you stop a minute? - What's the matter? - My skis are iced up. - Will you fix them? - Sure. Point your ski up. - When are you going to get married? - I don't know. That's up to Vivian. Then it won't be long. - Did you hurt yourself? - No. - Well, they're gone. Right to the bottom. - I'm sorry. I slipped. - Now what am I gonna do? - Have the ski patrol bring up another pair? No use giving them grief. We'll have to use the lift. It's stopped running. I know. You wait in the cabin there while I ski down and ask them to start it again. - I guess you'll have to. But be careful. - I will. Won't take me long. (Karen) Ted! - What happened? - My knee... The clamp on one of my skis broke and I fell. This would happen! Did you bang it up much? It hurts when I walk on it, but I guess it'll be all right if I don't use it for a couple of hours. By then the moon'll be on the other side of the mountain. We won't be able to see our way back down the run. Are both your skis outside? If I made your clamps fit my shoes... You couldn't. Besides, one of my skis is broken. Oh. Well, I guess we'll have to stay here all night. That's great. Now all we need is a blizzard to snow us in for a couple of weeks. - Even the telephone's dead. - Oh, that's too bad. I guess they'll send out the ski patrol to look for us. - They will? - Sure. They might have trouble finding us. I'd better hang this lantern up. Oh. Ouch. - Did you hang up that lantern? - Mm-hm. - Take off your shoe. Then your pants. - My pants?! - Roll 'em up. I'm worried about your knee. - They're too tight. - I'll take care of that. Which is it? - The left one. But you don't have to look at it. If you just leave it alone... My pants! What are you doing? You can't do this! - Pretty bad. Looks inflamed. - Does it? Mm-hm. - Does it hurt when I bend it? - No. No, no. All it needs is a little work-out. You can't let these things tighten up. Nei! Nei! Nei! It'll feel a lot better in a few minutes. - There, how does that feel? - Fine. All right... Walk on it. (groans) - Then you're all ready to go? - Yes. - Why didn't they go an hour ago? - They might've heard from them. - I knew something like this'd happen. - Don't worry, they're excellent skiers. If one of them was hurt, they'd probably make for a ski hut. There you are. We got nothing to worry about. Hey, suppose they have to stay in a hut all night? Karen'd be compromised, and I'm engaged to her. Think of my position. I am thinking, and it isn't of your position. Get going. This might turn into a calamity any minute. I guess the ski patrol must be lost. - What are you going to do? - Fix a bed for myself. If you think I'm sleeping outside, you're crazy. - Oh, I didn't want you to. I'll fix a bed for you. - I'll fix it. You fix your own. That's close enough. - But it'll be cold when that fire goes out. - Here's another blanket. Will you stop? - I was just going to tuck you in. - I don't want to be tucked in. Well, don't you want to kiss me good night? Maybe I'd better sleep outside - it's safer! No, no. I'll go to bed. - Good night. - Good night! So you think it's funny, huh? You wouldn't have fun like this if you married... someone else. She'll be awfully angry when we get back, won't she? Well, if she's mad enough, she won't marry you. (soft music) (Karen hums along) Da da-da da... Pretty, isn't it? (continues to vocalise) You sure have a swell ear for music. - Isn't that the way it goes? - Uh-uh. This way. (hums along) (vocalises) And even though it's snowing Violets are growing I know why and so do you Why do breezes sigh every evening Whispering your name as they do? And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling? I know why and so... - Say, not bad. - Not good. When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins When you dance with me I'm in heaven When the music begins I can see the sun when it's raining Hiding every cloud from my view And why do I see rainbows When you're in my arms? I know why and... - Well! - Yeah... well! - Hello. - Hello! See? I told you they'd be all right. Maybe, but this looks suspicious to me. Wait outside. - There was nothing to worry about. You see... - Clearly. I'm not snow-blind. - We had an accident. - Right on schedule! Well, I lost my skis and Karen started out to get me another pair and banged herself up. - Gee, does it hurt? It looks... - Oh, no. See? It's all right. - She's being brave. She can hardly stand. - So I noticed. I guess everything's all right, as long as Karen isn't compromised. - But I am. - What?! - You don't know what you're saying. - Yes, I do. - If I don't know what happened, who does? - Well, I do. I've seen through your little scheme to involve Ted, but I let it go because I thought Ted would see through it too. - Listen... - I've listened to all I'm going to. And I've put up with all I'm going to from that Scandinavian hillbilly! Hillbilly? Send her back to wherever she came from or we're through! And you're through at Sun Valley, and so is your band! Now wait... - Why drag the band in? This is between us. - I'm waiting for your answer. Ted, do something about it. Karen, get your things - you're going back to Norway. Well? If my being up here has caused you trouble, I'm sorry, but it's better we sort this out, so let's be frank. I will. There's a train out of here at 11:40 for New York, and tomorrow night, when you and your band are a sensational flop, my only regret will be that I'm not here to see it! Goodbye! Oh! Well, what happens now? Let her go. Who does she think she is, telling us we're through? And all those cracks about Karen! We'll put on a bigger show... Say, whose side am I on? Don't bother me. I've got unfinished business - with the lady I'm gonna marry. - I knew this would happen. - Isn't that sweet? Nothing's like romance. Say, what am I saying? She's my girl! ( orchestra plays "I Know Why (And So Do You)") (military drums) Say, did you ever dance the kiss polka? You can steal a kiss to this polka She'll be shy when first you try Then by and by she'll say, "Yah, by yumping yiminy" You should always do the kiss polka When there is a lovely moon above (vocalising) It's fun with the one you love (tune changes) I remember, oh so clearly That you nearly passed me by Then it happened in Sun Valley When you slipped and fell and so did I
