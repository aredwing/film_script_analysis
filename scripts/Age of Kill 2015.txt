Do I have your attention now? What the hell is this? You are an articulate man, you need not spend so ugly language. - Oh please. - No, you listen to me. I will tell you about the nature of terror. It is a primitive instinct. When it strikes, it's serious. It will be an independent entity. It is palpable. It is all-consuming. One can feel the terror, smell it and taste it.

Maybe a car bomb? Australia. Part of the realm. It was our catch colonial past. - Something different now, right? - Yes. If you want to "down under", you could a subject - - You must have money and something to offer. And there is nothing wrong with. Australians, they have thought of their economy. They have thought of the future. Australians are smart. Yes, and while smoking this country down the toilet. Filled with parasites, criminals and terrorists. Hell of scum, everybody. This is exactly the position we do not want people know. Shit. I'm not saying that I do not agree. I hold with eyelets. But this is all about, we need to show the British public that we are not A bunch of ignorant racists. We know how it feels to walk down the street - - Where we are in the minority. Surrounded by a culture that we do not understand. And that will not be integrated. We know how it is, not daring to take the bus. Imagine if you blew up. We are not the enemy. We stand in front of something big. But we need every patriotic men in this country - - That stand bag this. The first thing we have to deal with - - Is the perception. - Yes? - I am very pleased, Lexi. - You're letting him go? - There is just one more thing to do. I've done everything you asked for.

Check whether there are others who watch. First shootings and now this. I wonder what is going on? I do not know. But I think there will be more. Explosive devices have always been the most powerful weapon in terror. Even the simplest devices can have the greatest efficiency. I am very aware of your expertise in this area - - And it would be foolish not to take advantage of this. Down on the ground! Both! Lie down! Do not look at me! Get your head down! Stay down! So what? - He is dead. - Excellent, Sam. - Two down, two to go. - No, that's enough. - It is over. I'm done. - Why do you say such a thing? There were witnesses. They were just there when I pulled the trigger. The so gun, so the car. - They saw me. - And you let them live? Yes, I let them live. I can see how it can do it all confusing. I must find a way out. It is enough. It is final. Let Joss go and we lost both of them, okay? He you seen the effect of a nitrogen bomb or a chemical explosion? You know what happens if you miss the deadline. I cut it out of cardboard. Can you live with that on their conscience? I have sent details of the next target, get it done now - - Then you are already halfway there. Can you describe the car? En sort SUV. Registration VI63-ZPZ. Give me a full ballistic analysis. The parking garage needs to be cleared. If anyone would complain, please send them to me. I leave you to cop Hayes. - Thank you. - We will soon be finished. Hvorfor her? Why at this time, which is filled with people? He must know that he would be seen. - It's obvious, right? - What? The man is a lunatic, psychopath soft in the bulb or what to say ?. It is an all too quick assessment. We must look at the connection between the victims, perhaps we can predict the next move. We have a description of the man and his license plate - - He is quickly caught. - When were you promoted, Hicks? 18 months ago, why? It is not always that easy. - I want to talk to her. - Do not worry. Young Joss is doing well. I swear, if you hurt her ... Drop now superfluous and focus on the task. - Where are you? - Is there in two minutes. Tik tak, Sam. Damn it! Where are you? Where are you? Damn! Kom not kom not! It was 13 minutes late, Sam.

Hey, what happens? Of the road. - Did you hear something? - No, I heard nothing. In do not want it here. The sums for the ears. I must have them cleaned. Did you hear nothing at all? Yes, I heard something. These are from last night. The girl is one of the first to be shot. The guy she's with, have keys. This means that he lived there. It brings it down to three possible people. We have him. His name is Blake. Apartment 16A. - Make a full background check. - Are made. - He is secretly piston. - What? The military intelligence service. The man is a secret agent. Hi. Hej, Lexi. - I do not do more before I see him. - Or what? Did not you hear the sirens a few blocks away? It, Lexi, is the sound of the impact. The worst of all sound. Another like you failed - - With a simple task and could not deliver. You should not disappoint me in the same way. Are you with? Do as I say and be reunited with your loved ones. But failure will be punished. Have you understood it? No more requirements, Lexi. No more threats. I have only one thing of you: - - "Your unconditional obedience." Have you understood? There is a bag next to you at the wall. Pick it up. Do not open it. Do not tamper with what is in the bag. Put it in your trunk. Sit in the car and head south. About five minutes you will receive further instructions. Come away. Er du okay? Sorry, I was a little uncomfortable. Hicks, look at me. You need to focus now. Are you ready for it? And. In the other cases, the shots fired with surgical precision. As there has been an object even though it is extremely. This is more random. Clumsy. So it is perhaps another killer? I do not know. Maybe. Surveillance cameras will show something, but in the meantime I have ... Who is responsible here? - Who is responsible? - It is me. - And you are? - I'll take it here. - Sorry? - Hopefully it will go faster. Show me some ID? Siddiq, ikke? I expect full cooperation with you and your team - - You should not expect. I'll take full responsibility. Phil, you said that you would be here early. - I really need ... - Roy. Call me soon as you hear it here. - Gaz, old friend, how are you? - Fine my friend. Look at yourself in your best clothes. It has cost the box, right? - I gotta fit in? - Yes. Come with me, I need to talk to you. - Where is Jacko and Big P? - Big P is out on an errand. He would contact me as soon as possible. Jacko your damn risk. I have not heard from him. I hope you let me down. I will not take nicely. - What about you? - I have a few buses on the road. - And someone coming by train. - Know the rules? - Yes. - I mean it, no weapons. No knives, no chains, not even a bloody knuckles. - If someone has something, it must be away. - It is sorted. Listen, I have a little surprise for you. I have been in touch with some old boys from the other side of the river. You probably know who they are. I have said that they should interfere with the other. Mingle with the crowd. - Maybe nod nastily or two. - Who said you could do it? - I'm doing you a favor. - I will not see them. I do not want them around, is that clear? I must think about it. - You give them the initiative. - Then let them? We start nothing. This is not to initiate anything. At least not yet. See? I said that it was him! Stop ham! Back! All retires! Back! Be there! Listen all together. Can I have everyone's attention? Silence! So. Before I continue, there is one I will present. This is Bill Weybridge. Earlier, the head of MI6. Blake was on his team, so he is here in an advisory role. We will focus on the following scenarios: A. Blake has been radicalized and recruited for terror? Or two. He's just a simple killer who turns on headshots. You are wrong. Sorry, Commissioner, you have something to tell? I will only observe that, in my opinion, you are mistaken. Are you sweet to elaborate? Weybridge, until Blake's expulsion, there was not a stain on him, right? Correct. Sam Blake is a highly decorated war hero. Do you think that in the last six months, he has become a terrorist - - Or built up a hatred for society? There are other options, but on the whole, yes. These are the most likely scenarios. In my experience, are "most likely", it most often is wrong. Thank you, Commissioner. - Your observations are noted. - I have not finished. The key to catch this man is to study his victims. On the surface they seem unconnected, but we have to look again. And if we do not find anything, we must look again and again. There must be something that links two, three or four of them together. Maybe someone who is trying to hide the relationship. When we found it, we can begin to determine the killer's motives. Set in the time I want results. Come brothers! Hurry up! Forward! We have an important mission. And today is a beautiful day. It was time, what took so long? God, is it? God! Where is my phone? Wait a minute. Give me the police. No! Suspect approaching from the north. Received, proceed with caution. The suspect may be armed. Stay where you are! Stop! Stop! Call gain! We are approaching the greenhouse. The suspect described as armed and extremely dangerous. Be careful, air support is expected in six minutes. Good afternoon officers. Alt okay? Have you seen this man? I think not. Either you have seen him, or have not you? What is it? I've never seen him before in my life. Okay. Get out of there right away, slowly. We need immediate reinforcement in the greenhouse now. Last chance! Down on the floor, hands behind your head! Keep your hands up! Do it! Take it easy! Reports to the control center. The suspect escaped. - Ja? - Lexi? Onkel Tony, Gud, er du okay? - Has he done anything to you? - I'm fine, honey .. You should know that I do everything he asks me - - And I'll get you free. I promise. - I'll get you home. - Lexi, you're a good girl. Me and Aunt Sue, we love you. - Yes I know. - Look, Lexi. No matter what the shit planned, it happens no matter what you are doing. - But I'm ready. - How can you not say. Do not do more for him. Do you understand me, Lexi? He can go to hell ... Leave him alone! Very noble, but in the real world you are running out of family. And I know where Aunt Sue lives. I have a job for you, Lexi. Be ready! We approach os goal. He shoots at us! - They are at my heels! - Take the south exit now! Jump in! - Yes. - Yes? Thank you? I do not need thanks. I do not know who you are. I do not care what you've done. I do not know. And do not look at me! Stop it! I will not see your face. - What? - Let me introduce you to Lexi. She is, to put it bluntly, a whore, She prefers enough "escort", it sounds a little more respectable. Come on, Sam! Himself hello. Be it so! Hi. You and Lexi have much in common. Like you, she has proven to be a valuable resource. Tell her that she is doing incredibly well. He says you do it incredibly well. Tell her that I am very happy with her. - He said ... - I heard it. She is quarrelsome, right? I like her. Roy? Det er Pete. Hej. Take it easy! Take care of your heart. What's wrong? What? I also am just come home from a job in London. Just quietly, I come. Have I ever let you down? Precisely, look here. I get about 20 minutes. No more than half an hour. I order. Jill? It's hot and it's black. In addition, I can not promise anything. Why today? When there is twice as much police in the streets? Why not yesterday? Eller i morgen? Why make the effort to increase the risk? Do you think there is a connection between the shootings? It can not be a coincidence. Roy Dixon! What do you know about him?

He has been very busy the past 18 months. He is intelligent and charismatic, - - og han har en vision. He is dangerous. You should not underestimate her. What? Siddiq! She is very sharp. You should not shut her out. She can be a win. Listen Mr. Wade, we are very grateful for your valuable time - - But I have done something like this before. Do you have it? Frankly, you should go home. - You look tired. - I'm fine. Men tak for din omsorg. So let me put it a different way. I do not need you. - Get lost! - Listen, you little arrogant bastard. - Cares not to knock on? - When it's my own office? No! Something new?

On any other day, we would not talk about it here - - But with tension simmering there. But if they ignite Krudttnden - - Do the gods alone know what happens next. - It's your choice, but ... - You need to hear me say that? I know the procedure. Obviously, Prime Minister. You know why I wanted to be prime minister? In order to make a difference. It may seem a bit naive, but it's true. I want to sit in that position. In order to make this country better. But not here.
