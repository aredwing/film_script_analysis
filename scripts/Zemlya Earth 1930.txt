And after your death let me know, where you are: in Paradise or in Hell... ...and how you're doing. Fine, Petro. If possible, I'll give you notice. For 75 years he has plowed the soil with oxen... That's no small achievement! If I were a People's Commissar,... ...I'd given him the Order of the Banner of Labor. There are no Orders for oxen, grandfather. For what then? l could eat something. Live well, I'm dying. Pears he has liked. Go ahead, read on, friend! ''...The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock...'' Im not giving it away! I'd rather kill it...! Now, father, the kulaks are finished. We're getting machines as well. Vasili, I think, you're not right in the head... When we have the machines, we'll take their land away. I'm saying, you're crazy... It will work without you. You don't have to go. The whole village is laughing already. It's not the whole village that's laughing, father, just the kulaks and the stupid. You're saying I'm stupid? Not stupid, father, you just have grown old. Oh, the village Komsomol is coming! Then open the meeting! These filthy dogs, splendid fellows! Father! Im going! Semion, where are you now? Greetings, grandfather Petro! Grandfather Petro, greetings! Get lost, devil's brood! It's moving! It's moving! It's moving! It has stopped! It has stopped! It's moving! It has stopped! It has stopped! Write: premises are lacking for collective seeds and livestock, but not wonderful buildings for the kulaks... It's moving! It has stopped! It has stopped! l hears! I hear! l hears! No water in the cooler. l hear! Comrade chairman! In the city they want to know, if the tractor has arrived. Comrade chairman, the tractor is standing still! The tractor has arrived, the whole village witnessed it. The tractor can't be standing still. Go! Go on then! Go! It has been accomplished! The have brought it. That's the end. Grandfather Petro is right: It has been accomplished! May we prosper with the machines! Now the kulaks can just mourn their field borders! Beware, so your mother has nothing to mourn about! We will see. We will see. It's happening, Choma! Father! Throw away these crutches! Throw me up! l'll pay for it! Choma! Vasili has plowed the field with the tractor! Vasili! Hey, lwans! Hey, Stepans! Hey, Grizkas! Have you killed my Vasili? Choma, you? I'm asking you: Have you killed Vasili? No, uncle, it wasn't me. There is no God. And there are no priests either. Im asking you... Just like Vasili died for the new life, I'm asking you, to bury him according to the new ways... Neither priests nor church servants beyond the grave... It have to be our boys and girls themselves... And they are to sing new songs about the new life! Good, Uncle Opanas, we'll bury our Vasili ourselves. Without priests or church servants. And we'll sing new songs about the new life! Without a priest! Good, if there's no God... And if He exists after all? God, punish the sinners! Punish them, God! It's my Earth! I won't give it up! Punish them! Where is the priest? He's in there. Damn the kolkhozy. Vasili! Vasili! The deadly hate of the enemy on poverty took Vasili away from you... Hey, you have-nots! lt's me! Beat me up! I'd rather die, than give myself up! With the iron horse of Bolshevism Vasili destroyed thousand year old fields! Ive killed him at night! At night, when everyone was sleeping! And he walked on the street... And danced! ...with his hot blood he wrote the class enemy the death sentence... And you, Uncle Opanas, mustnt grieve. Vasili's fame will fly around the entire world... ...like our Bolshevist airplane above! The End
