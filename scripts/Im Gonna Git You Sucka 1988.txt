Put that down. You know Junebug Spade ? - Yes, we do. - Yes, I'm his mother. He was my husband. Mama, I just can't believe that Junebug didn't have any friends. Did you notice that not one person stayed when they found out it was Junebug ? - Now, baby, you know the boy wasn't shit. - Mama ! Don't get me wrong. He was my son, and I loved him. But when he got hooked on that gold, he changed. I bet he owed everybody he ever knew money. Mama, Junebug may have been a little crooked, But I'm sure that somebody besides us loved him too. I don't know. Maybe that's Jack. - Yes ? - Good afternoon, miss lady ma'am. May we come in ? Y'all ain't selling NoWay products, are you ? No ! We friends with Junebug. They're friends of Junebug's, mama. Come right in. I'm Cheryl, Junebug's widow, And this is Mrs. Bell Spade, Junebug's mother. Hmm. What's up ? I'm Willie. This here's Leonard. - And we come here... - What you tell them our real name for ? Are you stupid ? - No, they told us their real names, so... - Who's in charge ? - You are. - Who ? You in charge. Then shut the fuck up. - You all mind telling me what you want ? - Certainly. - Junebug used to work for me. - Used to work for us. - I work for Mr. Big. - We work for Mr. Big. It just so happens that Junebug died... - Owing Mr. Big $5,000. - Five thousand... - We here to collect. - Five thousand dollars ? We don't have that kind of money. No shit. "No shit" ! They don't have that kind of money ! Get off me ! I could look at these plastic slipcovers, the slipcovers. The stupid painted-on walls, look at this stupid painted... And tell that type of money ain't around here. You see the dude that painted those walls ? They got doo-doo paint ! It's all bullshit. Look at these white pillows. Look at these stupid magazines. Look, they got oranges and shit ! I'm sorry. But I do see somethin'. Somethin' that's gonna be worth at least... mmm... ten times that amount of money to Mr. Big. Well, what is it ? What do you want ? - You. - Mama ! Don't you touch... Ooh ! Good. If she moves, hit her again. - Looks like mama gonna have to teach you some manners. - Okay, come on, mama. You don't ever come in my house... Acting like no fool, fool ! Now, clean up that mess you made. You, put those pillows back on the couch where you found 'em. That's right. Pick all that shit up ! All of it ! And puff these pillows up too, man. - You stupid... come here ! Come here ! Why you gonna go mess the nice lady's house up for, man ? I only did it... you told me when we came in to beat her up and mess up her house ! - I didn't tell you shit like that, man ! - Yes, you did ! Now, mister, you and your friend got a choice. You can either go out that window or take the stairs. Okay. We gonna take the stairs. Yeah, we'll take... Yeah, we'll take the stairs. Oh ! Ow ! Get your pants outta my face ! Oh ! Get off me, man. Get off me ! - Ma ! - Jack ! - Mama ! - Oh, Lord, my baby's home at last ! Mama ! My baby's home ! Come on in. Ma, you okay ? Oh, yes, just some bill collectors. Cheryl. Come look who's here. Oh, honey, you look so good in this uniform. All them medals ! You remember Cheryl, don't you ? Hello, Jack. Hi, Cheryl. Been a long time, huh ? Yeah, it has been a long time. Honey, why don't you go put your things in the room and have something to eat ? - Cheryl made a fine dinner. - Mama, that sounds like a good idea. And Jack, baby, Mama wants you to know... I kept your room just the way you left it ten years ago. Oh, ma. My baby's home. Right here. Smells good. It is good. Mama, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the funeral. I got here as soon as I could. I know, baby. Just glad you're here now. Mama, exactly how did Junebug die ? He... Mama... She's really taking this pretty hard. You know how your mother is, Jack. Is somebody gonna tell me what's going on ? Jack, not too long after you left, Junebug started hanging out with a bad crowd. I mean, he even started selling drugs, Jack. And then things really got bad when he... Well, what ? Cheryl, come on. He started wearing gold chains, Jack. Oh, God, no ! It started out as just one or two. It seemed like every time he'd get some money, he'd buy more gold chains. He was wearing hundreds of them, Jack. Hundreds. Not gold. Yes, Jack. Gold chains and medallions and rings... And even his teeth. You can't imagine what it was like to kiss him. He took a picture just before he died. We put it on the mantle. Junebug ! How did he go to the bathroom with all this stuff on ? Okay. All right, who are these people Junebug was hanging out with ? Well, He worked for a man named Mr. Big. He rules the crime world here. - Those men that your mother threw down the stairs ? - They work for Mr. Big too. They came in here saying that Junebug owed 'em all kinds of money, crazy money. And I really think that they're the ones who killed him. Well, don't you worry about a thing. Jack Spade is here, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. Oh. I better go check on mama. - Where is the girl ? - we almost had the girl, Mr. Big. Yeah, we almost. She's beautiful. She's gonna be worth far more than the money Junebug owes. She'll be worth maybe 10 or 20 times. Far more than money. Anyway, she's got a real soft juicy fruit butt. But the only problem was that this old lady, She punched me in the stomach real hard ! Then she started crying and screaming and stuff, right ? And a dude came in, this big dude. - I think it's her son or something. - What dude ? - The soldier dude. - I didn't see him. The dude. The fucking dude that came in ! - Then he started... He hit me from behind. - He hit you ? - And I went down. - Oh, you mean the soldier dude ! - Yeah, the soldier dude. - Okay, okay. Then he hit me from behind. And I went down. I was like this. - Then the dude shot me ! - He didn't shoot you. He did. Kept on biting on my ankles. - Where did you get a stupid lie like that from ? - Enough. Now, Junebug worked under you, Which means you owe me his debts. If that girl is anything you say she is, Then we'll call it even. I have no patience when it comes to collecting. Now, I suspect... You'll bring me that girl right away. Yes, sir, uncle Mr. Big. Yes, sir, Mr. Big. Uncle Mr. Big, I have a question. What about the mother ? If he gets in your way, kill him. I better not hear any more about that guy... Or it's your asses ! You got that ? Yes, sir, uncle Mr. Big. It'll be our asses. It'll be your ass. Good. You boys can leave either through the window... or the stairs. We'll take the stairs. We always take the stairs. - Lenny ? - What ? - You mad at me ? - I'm gonna be mad on the way down these stairs. Ooh ! Ow ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Oh ! He was such a sweet baby. I don't know how he turned out so bad. He missed you when you was gone, Jack. - Yeah ? - Yeah. I missed him too, mama. You know, I remember when me and Junebug used to go to the park. Junebug loved the swings. He'd say, "Jack, give me a push." And I'd take him and run, but I wouldn't push him. I'd run back in, then I'd run again. Still wouldn't push him. Shut up, Jack ! Do you remember this ? Do you remember when you made that for mama ? I made this in Mrs. Wilson's class. That's right. You was always so thoughtful to your mama. - That's why I'm so glad you're home. - Mama. W-wait a minute. What ? - Mama ! - Huh ? That's John Slade. Yeah ? I didn't know you knew him. Yes. We was very much in love once. Before I met your father. I almost married Slade. But he was so busy being a crime fighter, Flying in and out of windows, chasing criminals. Hmm. Had no time to settle down. Anyway, wish he was here now. He'd find out what happened to my boy and he'd make 'em pay. Hey, mama, now. Mama, I'm here, and I'm gonna find out what happened to Junebug. No, no, no, no. You're all I got ! Don't you do nothing foolish. I'm just gonna ask a few questions, that's all. - No, Jack. - Ma, just a few questions. I promise. - Okay ? - Okay. Okay. - Be careful. - I will. "John Slade to host youth gang competition." 2:00. - Hey, move it ! - Can I get a cab ? I want this shit clean. Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! It's a new record ! Right now I'd like to talk to a man who's no stranger to this community. And he's considered by many to be, well, a local hero of sorts. While serving the community in the '70s, he helped topple such crime bosses as Mr. Big. He's responsible for today's events. I'm speaking, of course, of Mr. John Slade. A lot of people would like to see you come back and help rid the old neighborhood of Mr. Big. - How do you respond to that ? - No, skip. I'm sorry. I'm retired now. It's a job for the police department. Oh, but tell us, Mr. Slade, what is today really about ? To provide for these young people an opportunity to let steam off... In a very positive way... By competing in events that are familiar, if you will, to their environment. Do you know what I mean, brother ? Well, actually, I don't. I didn't grow up around blacks. I grew up in the suburbs. My dad was a lawyer. My mom was a doctor. All my friends were white. Everybody used to tease me 'cause I didn't speak jive. I couldn't dance to save my life. The only step I really knew was that step that Springsteen does... In the "Dancing in the Dark" video. I love Springsteen. Yes. Reporting for WBLD news, this is Skip Balins saying, in the immortal words of our negro poet, Don Cornelius, "Peace and soul." Thanks, guys. - John Slade ? - Yeah. I need to talk to you. - You sellin' NoWay products ? - No. Oh, okay. - Can we go somewhere more private ? - Yeah. This way. Senior itizen Mugging Competition... will begin in five minutes. Okay, young man. What can I do for you ? - Do you remember that woman ? - Yeah, I sure do. That's Bell Brown. We used to call her "hot chocolate." She had the softest eyes. She had these big old round, brown, firm ti... She would do this little trick with her mouth where she would... That's my mother, man. She was a good woman, your mother. Yes, she was. Absolutely, a good woman. I should have married your mother. Wait a minute. You ain't gonna tell me I'm your daddy or no shit like that now... because I don't wanna hear no bullshit. No. Nothin' like that. That's my brother. He's dead. He O.G.'d. How does he go to the bathroom with all this shit on ? Look, I'm sorry about your brother... And I'm really sorry for Bell because she don't deserve it. Look at this. I bought that on the street. You know what that shit is doing to our kids ? I know. I'm from the streets. Every day I see kids walking around killing and stealing for gold chains. I see kids with medallions so big they can hardly stand up. All stooped over and shit, trying to carry that stuff. But what's really awful, man, is you see a young brother... with this cheap, imitation electroplated gold crap around their necks, and it breaks out in this funky green rash... with these bumps and shit. It just make you wanna puke. Yeah. Yeah, I know it's happenin'. What do you want with me ? I want you... to take down Mr. Big and put an end to this gold-chain shit. Hey, look, I'm sorry about your brother. I'm sorry for Bell. But I don't wanna be no hero no more, man. - I'm a long way from that. - Yeah, and look what happened. - The people need you. - The people need me ? It was the people, man, that made me retire. The people said I was too violent, a bad image for the kids. So fuck the people. The people... Look, I'm retired now, okay ? And I kind of enjoy the feeling of staying alive. Okay, brother ? I was one of those kids that looked up to you, man. I believed in you. I wanted to be like you. You were the best. Hello ! Hello ? Is anybody here ? Yes, my brother. How may I help you ? Yeah, are you Kalinga, leader of the people's revolutionary army ? - Are you C.I.A. ? - No. - I am Kalinga. - I need to talk to you. Have a seat. Would you care for something to eat ? A bean pie perhaps ? No, uh, I'm not hungry. Something to drink ? Please sit down. Herb tea ? A soda ? Okay, soda's fine. Articulate your needs. I'm here to listen. How may I help you ? Well, first of all... It's an acquired taste. Now... How may I help you, my brother ? Look, I'm here because I can't stand what's happening in this community. - Yes ! - And somebody has to make a change. - Yes ! - Brother, will you help me ? Yes ! Well... I wish I could. Damn it, man. I heard the people's revolutionary army was once a thousand strong. - Now, what happened ? - They got government jobs. What ? You know that government office building on 25th street ? - Yeah ? - We went down to take it over. But they were hiring that day. The brothers walked in with guns... and came out with jobs.
