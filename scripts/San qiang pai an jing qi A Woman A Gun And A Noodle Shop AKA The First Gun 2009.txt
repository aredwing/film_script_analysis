Do you have something better that kills instantly? For the boss's wife, of course. The gun.... The greatest invention of mankind. The latest in technology for maximum violence. Just pull your finger back.... Must die. Moose? Moose, what? Must die. Oh, he said, "moose die." - What does that mean? - If a moose dies, men will die faster. - Awesome! - No, no, no. Not fast, but instantly! Wonderful. How much? - Ten Guan! - How many Guan? Ten Guan! Ten Guan? - Ten Guan, for this piece of junk? - That's ridiculous! - Cheaper. One Guan. - Nine Guan. - Two Guan. Three Guan. - Eight Guan. Seven Guan. - Three. - Six. Five. - Five. Four. Three Guan. - Three Guan. Deal! For once in my life... ...I own the world's most powerful weapon! Everyone will be amazed. My lady, I have something even better. The cream of the crop, the most impressive thing ever. - Want to take a look? - Of course. Want to try it out? Oh, my goodness! It's intense! I prefer the gun. Why did you buy a gun? - Just for fun. - I don't believe you. What are you up to? You're making me nervous. You're always nervous. We've been together for a while... ...and you haven't changed a bit. Not for that long. Only 71 days. You're so sweet... ...counting the days. The boss's wife has always been a piece of work. And today she bought a gun. It seems she's really going against the boss. How come the boss was so quiet? When the cannon went off, it sounded like thunder. But he didn't react at all. I bet he's up to something. Yeah. I feel our noodle shop is doomed. Something's about to happen. You're scaring me. Don't be afraid. I'm here to protect you. A Painting of a Boy Boss, it's Zhao. Come in. - Boss. How's your leg? - Fine. You look better. Did you hear the cannon? It was impressive. The cannon ball went miles away. She wants to drive me crazy. Nothing ever changes. Your wife just bought a gun from the Persians. It's this long, this thick, three barrels... ...made of iron. - What for? - I don't know. Oh, yes... - ...and "moose die." - What? It's a foreign language. It means instant death. You know how big the bullets are? This big! Three of them. If a moose dies after being shot... ...imagine if that bullet hits a person. Take the money and leave. Oh, no! The police are coming! They heard the cannon! What should we do? - Don't panic. - Where's the gun? I hid it. Where? Do you want them to find it by marking it on purpose? - Where is Boss Wang? - He's resting. He fell while riding a horse. Earlier today... ...did all of you hear a loud boom? Yeah. - It was so loud. - Yeah. - It was thunder. - It was a cannon. - Someone was here. - No! - Search this place! - For what? - The cannon. - Fine... ...I'll give you the tour. You must be hungry, officer. Hurry up and make some noodles. Zhao! Li! Chen! Here! Chief, the prisoners are here. - Kneel over there. - On your knees. - What did you hear on the way? - A boom. - What did you see? - Smoke. - What can you tell from that? - Cannon ball is big. How big? At least this big. No, it's this big. - Where was the cannon? - Around here. But somehow it disappeared. These people are hiding something. Come over here. Look at them. These four people committed adultery. We are sending them to court. - Zhang. - Here. Lately... ...our work has been focused on catching infidelity. - Yes. - Are any of them guilty? Can you tell? It's hard to say. The both of you look suspicious. Officer, I'm innocent. He's been chasing me, but I'm not interested. I bet you two are hiding something. Officer, you are funny. I wouldn't have the guts to.... - Zhang! - Sir! You are the best detective among us. What do you think? I'd have to investigate. Look at you, scaring yourself to death. We can't break the law. What's the big deal? Everything is fine. I've been so worried. I can't take it anymore. How will we handle the gossip if others find out? Nobody dies from gossip. - It's our life. Let others talk. - Lower your voice. Didn't you see those prisoners? So young, and good-looking. Have probably had an easy life. Now it's over for them. We can't be like them, we have to live well. Want to leave me? I'm telling you, not a chance! It's been 10 years since I bought you. You cost me three Guan and 800 Wen. Your womb is like a piece of junk. It won't lay any eggs. Can't bear me a son... ...and you won't act out a scene as my son. I don't ask much. You bought a gun. Where did you get the money? It's none of your business. It's my own money. Why did you buy it? I am telling you, Wang. This will be the last time you abuse me like this. Are you going to shoot me? I'll show you who's boss. What's so urgent? Coming in this late. Your wife and Li... ...are having an affair. - For how long? - I want money. How long? It's been a while. - Where? - At Southern Hill, in the carriage. ln the carriage? How dare they do it in my carriage! Li, that son of a bitch! He came here to be an intern. What did he learn? He learned how to steal my woman! You should send him to jail. Well, that won't work. I bet his family would bail him out. So he wouldn't suffer. True. Have any ideas? Gentle. No, no. Lower your voice. Quiet. Don't move. Gentle. - So painful. - Feeling better? You can leave now. You cheating slut! Oh, my heavens! Where did he come from? Don't beat her! Stop it! Boss. You misunderstood! We didn't do anything! Look! I was popping her blisters! Look at me. Don't be so ruthless! Heavens! Why won't you listen! Boss, take a look. I was using this to pop her blisters. You brought the gun with you? You are such a coward! Stop! Don't run. Look, he stopped. Come back if you dare. I don't need a gun to take care of you. Let's go, get on the carriage. - Where are we going? - Back to the noodle shop. What? Now? - We are going back now? - Of course. You'll be killed if you go back now! Since he already found out, I want him to divorce me, so I can be free. Do you really think he'll divorce you? I will divorce him if he refuses. He just needs to sign the paper. I will go with you sooner or later. I'm now officially your woman. You are such a wimp, the biggest I've ever seen. Come here. Let's go back. Why should I go back? I don't want to. I'm not going back. How can you run away like this? I'm so disappointed in you. As a woman... ...all I wanted was a shoulder to lean on... ...but there was none. Then I met you. I thought I found one. But I was wrong about you. You don't deserve my love. - I'm just-- - I don't want to hear it! Stay here if you want! Please sit. About their affair... ...how did you find out? I accidentally saw them. Do you want to make a lot of money? I have a job for you. Kill them both. I'll give you 10 Guan. As a policeman... ...your monthly salary is only 250 Wen. Ten Guan will give you a nice life for a few years. Afraid of going to jail? I'm afraid of that too. If two people are missing... ...and the police investigate, there must be an explanation. So I have a plan. I'll tell them my wife ran away with her lover and nobody saw where they went. Without evidence, there's nothing they can do. Also, you're a policeman. Who would suspect you? What do you think? Will you do it? It's a deal, then. Tomorrow I will pretend to go on a trip. While I'm gone, say my wife and Li ran away together. It makes sense. - The bodies.... - Fifteen Guan. What? You want 15 Guan? Those two lives worth 15 Guan? It's the market price. Fine. I'll give you 15 Guan. But bury the bodies well. Deposit. - How much? - Ten Guan. - Five Guan. - Ten Guan. - Six Guan. - Ten Guan. - Eight Guan. - Ten Guan. Divorce Paper Stop! Where were you last night? Why didn't you come back? You know how much we worry? I couldn't sleep well. I'm talking to you! Say something! I have some good news. I finally figured out... ...how to open the boss's safe. What for? He owes us our salary. Are you going to steal the money? - Keep your voice down. - You gonna steal the money? It's not stealing if I take back what he owes me. If you take the money without his permission... ...isn't that stealing? I made a fake expense for the 15 Guan. If the government checks it out, they won't find anything. This is Li's. This belongs to that slut. You are so cruel. Stabbed her so many times! - Did you take care of the bodies? - Yes. Don't come back. I don't want to see you again. You're thoughtful. You brought her gun back for me. No. If I dare follow you... ...that would make me a criminal. This is not a crime. We are doing this to protect our rights as employees. Out of my way. I wish Li were here. He knows foreign languages. He's talented and mysterious. - He would make the right call here. - Why are you talking about him? Come back! Come back here! Oh, no. We slept too much. Oh, no. We overslept. Don't be frightened. Wang's not home. Why are you so afraid of him? Wang's a mean person. Who's not afraid of him? He abuses you every night. Aren't you scared? I'm not scared of Wang. You always wanted to know why I bought the gun. If I can't kill him, I will kill myself. It's been 10 years. Ten years. People envy me because I married rich. But nobody knows what I've been through. Ever since I met you... ...I felt hope in my heart. I know you have a soft spirit. You can't take responsibility for us. You can't do much for me. I won't ask you to take care of me. When did you get back? You freaked me out. Boss, are you still angry? Please don't be mad. It's not all your wife's fault. As a man, you treat her poorly every day. Do you think that's right? Please say something. Don't be so quiet. Why so serious? Boss? Boss. It's stuck. It's me. What are you doing? Boss's wife is sleeping. Li disappeared again. Really? Anyone home? Nothing much, just here for a chat. Who--? Who is it? Who are you talking to? I'm just trying to see if he's in there. Have you done this before? You seem experienced. Don't flatter me. I'm still new to this. - What are you doing? - I'm trying as well. Why? Didn't I just do that? Come here. The safe's right here. One and nine, forward to 10. Two and eight, forward to 10. Three and seven, forward to 10. Four.... Four and six, forward to 10. Oh, my heavens! You see that? I'm the one who's truly smart... ...talented and mysterious. Do it quick. Four, six, eight.... Your 800 Wen. My 800 Wen. We got our salary. What are you calculating? The interest. What interest? Our salary is good enough. My goodness. - He's so spiteful. - What do you mean? It looks like Boss knows about his wife's affair with Li. - He put a curse on them. - Nonsense! The proof is here. lsn't this Li's shirt? - How would I know? - Fine. I'll find Li, and show it to him. Let me go. Boss! Boss! You thought I would die so easily? You thought I would sign this divorce paper? Where have you been all night? - Why are you carrying the gun? - I brought it back on purpose. I've decided I'll hold onto it. If one day someone finds out... ...I'll take responsibility. - What did you do? - It's all taken care of. What did you do? I drank too much and slept until now. Perhaps I shouldn't have done it... ...but I have no regrets. Hurry! Run. Who are you? You tell Wang he can't bully me anymore. I'm not afraid! If I see Wang... ...I'll be sure to tell him.
