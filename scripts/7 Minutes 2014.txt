We are going to get on our feet. We are going to get out of this town. We are never going to look back. Ever. This whole county was Indians. Just open land as far as the eye could see. Do you know how the settlers took over? I heard they won it in a poker game. I am serious here. Ok! They had superior firepower. Nope. More complicated than that. They could not just go in there guns blazing. They were hopelessly outnumbered. What they did was they pitted the tribes against each other. And they stirred up a whole bloody Indian war. After the dust settled and the tribes had just about wiped... Each other out, those old generals. Just waltzed in and took it for themselves. At least they got to keep the casinos. I am telling you. We have been cursed ever since. Cursed? No. I am not cursed. You are cursed. Are you guys ready? Yeah. Are you ok? Yeah. Usually I am the jittery one. All right! We got this. Get your game face on. Everyone get down. Get down on the floor. Get down on the ground. Just listen to me, and no one will get hurt. Just do as we say, and you can get back. To rob everybody else. You got it. Stay down.

No. Do not mind if I do. I trust you boys was $62,000 of my product. I all know about Lawrence. Right? I do not want another Lawrence situation. He is onto us. If he was onto us, he would have already pulled us over. Mike! What? Just relax. Man. I am going to turn off up here, and if he turns off too... Then we will know that he is onto us. Green light, boys. Go, go, go, and go. Fuck! Man. We are fine. We are fine. What are you doing? Hey! Hey! Do not do this. I am not going back to prison again. Owen! Goddamn. One second. Doug is going to kill us. Mike. Fucking idiot. What the fucks are we going to do now? - We have to go back. - Where to go back... To Doug. Tell him what happened, ask for more time. Whom do you think? You are talking about. He is an executive. He does not get anything out of us being dead. He is a killer. Sam. If he kills us. He gets nothing. He gets insurance that nobody will ever fuck him over again. Sam. You do not know how this works. You do not show up to a guy like Doug empty-handed. No way. So. We ran into a little trouble. The cops were all over us. We had to dump the drugs. We are going to get your money. We just... We just need a little more time. Children have supposed to be afraid of fairy tales. It is through these stories they learn to fear the big bad wolf, beware the old lady who lives in the candy cane house, and the troll under the bridge. Each one is a little warning. The messages. They have... They have become forgot. They lose their power. So stories. They need to retell. I like you, man. I prefer a successful conclusion. You got 48 hours. If we are going to pull this off. We had better have a plan. Entrance, main office, four employees, Pete's office, Pete is safe. Average police response time is 8 to 10 minutes. What is the security like? None. We are in and out in seven minutes. Oh! Shit! Robbery in progress. I request backup. Request 3013 Colby. Repeat, request backup. Robbery in progress. 10-4. 3013 Colby Avenue. Requesting additional units. I will advice. Proceed with caution. All available units... Hey! Just give us the money. And let us get out of here. Pete? What the fuck is going on back there. Jesus! Man. Hey! Enough! Then you get the keys. Please just let us go. Somebody please shut her fuck up. Get the fuck... Get on the ground. She is scared. She is scared. Did not I tell you not talk to her? This is not your problem. All right? Just stay cool. This is not about you. Put the gun down. What are you doing here? I know all about you guys. Jerome... How do you know... how do You... how do you know anything? What the fucks are you talking? Put it down. You put it down. And your dinner served. Thank you. I even snuck in extra coleslaw. Do not tell. Why do they make you do this? If you are, like, you know. Nobody makes me do anything. Plus. They say it is actually good to be on your feet. It helps the baby get into position. So! You got any big plans tonight? Just, heading over to the tavern. Oh! The tavern. Is that right? There is anybody you are looking to see over there? No. Someone named. I do not know. Brandy? What did I tell you about her? I know. I know. And you just keep going back? Did you ever wish that things were different? You know, like, in your life. Jerome, you think I want to be working here everyday living... in a shoebox waiting for this baby to pop? I... Look! If you see my fianc there. You tell him the beers cheaper in our fridge. All right? Yeah. All right. Have a good night. Face it. We are fuck. We are not fuck. We just need to come up with a game plan. I may have something. If you were going to rob Someone. Who would it be? Somebody rich. Yeah. Rich... Rich is good, but how about somebody. Who could not say shit about it? Like what? Back at thanksgiving, while you. And K was eating your pumpkin... Pie. Uncle Pete would not shut up about his new boat, I got some information. You want to steal from uncle Pete? Yeah. He cannot say shit because he is already in it up to his elbows. Remember when he had to get that call and he went outside. I went outside to smoke and I heard... He talks about some person named Fergus. Did Fergus do what? Are you kidding me? Jesus Christ! He shot himself. Look! You do not be going all chicken shit on me here. Just keep your mind on what about this is all. All of that cash. Fuck Fergus. That bustards be singing like a canary anyway. This is a better split. Two ways instead of three. So! I did some detective work, and it turns out. That our friend Fergus, The one who killed himself. Is formerly of Everett Bank and Trust, And he had been under indictment for fraud. Check this out. More than $500,000 in cash still for unaccounted. Holy shit! Sam worked for him all through high school. He knows better than anyone does. Anything that Uncle Pete gives two shits about... is in that little save in his office. Right? That was years ago. Uncle Pete's the kind of person who is... been wearing the same suit for 20 years. You are the kind of person who makes. Assumptions that are not always. Right. Same this is our way out. It is perfect. What is he going to say? I stole some money and then they stole it from me. Then he goes to jail, too. Hey! I Can. Brandy. Oh! Man, Brandy. What do you know about robbery anyone? It is not a real robbery. We just walk in and take it. You shut up. You look so serious. Hey! Brandy. We are... We are busy. Can I buy you some shots? Yeah. Yeah. I suppose so. Thanks. Thanks, Brandy. What are you doing? Man. What? What do you mean? What am I doing? She asked if we could have shots. I said yes. My parents are sleeping. Hey! Come here. - What are you doing? - What? - Let me just get a beer. - Nope. You are coming with me. I have to go. Wait! Talk to me. I just have to get out of here. This... this was a mistake. You have... you have everything. Man! You have everything that you want. What about are you talking? Any girl. They... they just throw themselves at you. You do not know me. I do not know anything about me. Jerome. Jerome, just stay cool. Just stay cool. Stay cool. Lock the door. Lock the door. Fuck! I thought I locked it. Jerome gives me the gun. Hey! Turn your face against the way. I just cannot let your guys do this. Sure! You can. We are not even stealing. The money has already stolen. This is my job. Jerome listens to me. We need this money. We need it. We have... We have all known each other a long time. Soon this will all be over. You will never hear from us again. Just give me the gun, Jerome. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Whoa! Fuck! What the hell? What the... Do not stop the party on my account. Boys. Put the gun down. Do not point that gun at me. What is that? Mike? Mike? Mike. Mike, Mike, stay with me. Stay with me, Mike. Stay with me. Here are you, the man with the plan. It is a little early to celebrate if you ask me. What about are you worried? Come on! It is a robbery. A million things could go wrong. Like what? Do you remember the gas station robbery out on Route 12? Sure! What did you hear? One comes in, Randy pulls out a gun and fucking... Shoots him and saves the today? Yeah. Come on! Randy? I do not know. I do not know Randy. You know Randy. The motherfucker with the shit in his ears and... I know Randy, but I do not him that well. Maybe he fucking got lucky. Ok. Well! Two guys come in the store. I thought there was only one guy. You got to fucking listen to me. Just let me tell the story. Two guys come in, ski masks on, coming in with guns, pull Randy over the counter. Gives us the combination. Hurry up! Give it up. I do not know. They do not fucking give us the combination. Please do not fucking... You killed him. Zip freaks out, pulls his mask off loses his shit, gets caught on the security camera, the guy. That he is with... boom... Bang him in the chest, Lays him out, leaves the gun with Randy takes the credit, And as we know it today, Randy is this fucking... bad ass gas station gunslinger. Where would you hear that? It does not matter. Where I heard it. I am just saying we got to be ready for anything. I am not saying... You are going... to lose your shit like Zip, but we have to have a plan. This seven minutes and out fantasy is not a plan. Sounds like a plan to me. It is a stick up, it is not rocket science. Why? Because you say so. - You got a better idea. - Who the fucks are you? Who the fucks are you? Are you a fucking a master criminal? I do not fucking flush drugs when I do not have to... you fucking idiot. Mike. We are trying to come up with a plan. I was trying to save us all from the cops. Why you got to bring that shit up. - That cop was not going to come. - This is not helping. Maybe we are crazy. Maybe we should just go to the cops. You want to go to the fucking cops. - And say what? - No way. Fuck! That is crazy. We could tell that about Doug. That is got be worth something. We cannot... if we tell them about Doug. We will find a way to kill us. All right? All right, stop, stop, and stop. We are going to go in there, get the money, and get out of town. All right? Enough of this pussy worrying. No one at Uncle Pete's is going to want to shot. They are going roll over and show us the goods. We will be in and out in seven minutes. Like my brother said. We should have code names. What is the point? So that we can talk to each other... without using our actual names. That is ridiculous. It is fucking awesome. It is actually not the worst idea he ever had. If we need each other's attention, We could just say like you. You know. Hey! Get over here. Give me all you money. That is good. That is good. Come on! Man. Be serious. Oh! Yeah? Do you want to go? Gorilla versus Death. I fucking cannot see. Hey. Jesus! Man. That is good. That is scary. Fucking $14 for a piece of plastic. Lucky I got that five-finger discount. Worked out real good last time. This all? Yeah. How is Justice? She is good. She is getting big. I bet she is a cutie Just like her papa. By the way, Brandy has been talking some shit about you. Says you are a big asshole. Oh! Yeah? Does not know what? She is talking about. That is what I said. Do you want a bag for this? Now. Yes. Just put it in the bag. Bye Kirsten. Bye. You might want to keep that hidden. It is in a bag. What is in the bag? Nothing. It does not look like nothing. Hey, pops. How are you doing? One of you suckers got a cigarette. Yeah, got you covered. Much obliged. These bastards are up to some bullshit. I can smell it. Dude. I have been saving this for a rainy day. You got an arsenal. You never know when you are going... to nee some superior firepower. Look! Do not point it at me. - It is loaded and ready to go. - What? - Seriously. - Yeah. All right. If we get in there and we get 500.000. Take away the 60 that we owe Doug, split it between us, We are still going to be way ahead of the game. Is it 145? 145 are for each other. All right. Who is next? This is no time to lose sight of the plan. Fuck you. Stay focused. What about is he talking? Sam. - Let us go, please. - What is going on? Look at what you have done. You killed her. You killed her. Shut up. You saw it, the Bitch! Went crazy. I did not have a choice. No, this is your fault. You did this. We are lucky she only shot one of us. There is no "us," Tuckey. I am not dropping this gun, boy. And I am not going to die. You going to tell him or should I? Sam, what is going on? We are close. Tuckey. Come back tomorrow. I got a sweet tooth. You know. How about a piece of that pie? That is it. Girl. Do you want whip cream on that? Yes. Ma'am. Thank you. You ever think about getting out of this town. Doubt you picked that lock for the small talk... Ran into your boy the other day. Seemed like he was up to some strange shit. What is that supposed to mean? I do not know. Seemed like he and his friend Owen was up to a little caper. I... I do not know what you are talking about. You know. Look! Tuckey, I am pregnant, and my heart is racing really... fast right now so whatever you are doing here, It is not funny. Ok? So! Can you just leave? Please. I was not trying to be funny. And as far as I am. I know, an increased heart rate. Never hurt a fetus. I saw a TV show about a pregnant woman who... Fell eight stories, landed flat on her belly... Deader than a door, nail, but her baby... her baby was just fine. I got her pretty good. Did not. Shut up! Bruce. Look at your sweet belly. Just do it for the kid, Kate. Tell me what I need to know. I do not know anything. I already told you. That is ok. Because I bet, you mean something to somebody. Sam, why would you not say anything. That is right. Let us finish this, fucking amateurs. Do not fucking look at me. You turn around and look at the wall. I am not Sam. I will not hesitate to blow your kidneys, intestines, bladder, And everything else all over this floor. Now, give me the keys to the safe. See! How easy that was. That money is not going to change you. You will still be the same old piece of shit. You have always been. Ok. Sam? God! He is going to kill him. Wake up. Wake up, sleepy head. Hi. Hey. Are you ok? Yeah. I am fine. Why? It is just that these past couple of days. You seem a little bit different. I am ok. Hey! I was doing the laundry earlier. And I saw you had uncle Pete's card in your pocket. Is he finally going to give you a job down there? Something likes that. Is there something? You are not telling me. No. Nothing. Do not worry about it. Look! We are going to make this work. We are going to get on our feet. We are... going to get out of this town and we are... never going to look back. Ever. Sam? Sam? Sam, wake up. Where the fuck are you going? I am not going anywhere. I am not going anywhere. Get the fuck over there with them. Yeah. Hurry. You are fucking idiot. Get the fuck on your belly. How do you like it? Make sure you have interlocked your fingers behind your back. You ever had that happen to you. Motherfucker? That is what about I am talking. Let us just get out of here. It is not that simple. What about are you talking? We got two dead bodies already. And that I am not going to matter in a court of law, anymore. Therefore, you can die with them or come with me. It is your call. I am not killing anyone. What the fuck are you doing? Get against the wall. Sam, hurry the fuck up. Keep fucking looking at me like that. I am going to bust your face up. I promise you. Get up. Get up. Remember what your daddy taught you. Do not get caught. What is up? I thought I was a big asshole. Where would you hear that? Everywhere. I am sorry. Look! Look! Look! Hey! You know about Annie and me. For the sake of Justice now I cannot keep running around. You were not thinking about Justice the other night. Yeah! Because I was thinking with my dick. I like that line of thought. Brandy. So! You want me to be a little more discreet. I get it. Ok. Seriously? Look! Look! Hey! Hey! Hey! You are a beautiful girl. You are great. It is just... It is not going to... Come on! Do not play hard to get... What is this? It is nothing. You need a lift. No. I am fine. Now... Come on! It is cold outside. No. I am fine. All right! Well! I am... I am just going to drive alongside... You until make it home safe. Fine. Do you want to give me a ride? Give me a ride if it makes you happy. Tomorrow. Tomorrow it is. I have never been in the front of one of these before. What am I doing? He has a kid and a wife. He is bad news. Oh! God. Are... are... are... are you ok? You have to pull over. Ok. Pull over. Pull over. Ok. Ok. Ok. He is a fucking asshole. Is not? Would you get back in the car? You know what he had in his pants. He had a gun. It was loaded. I could tell. Do not make up stories. I do not know what he is going to do with it... However, he is up to something. I know that. You have had a few drinks. All right? Just... just simmer down. I am not lying. He showed it to everything and me. Just come on. Get in the car. Get in the car. Here you go. Thanks, Jerome. You have been very sweet. Oh! My God! Gross. Jerome, what are you doing? Look! I am sorry. I have to go. Hey! Baby, I am just on my way home. Well! Hello, cutie pie. Who the fuck is this? It is you are new partner. Now you do what I tell you. You do not say a word to anyone else... And maybe you will get to see your girlfriend again. You got it. Hello? Sam? Is that you? What is going on? Babe! It is nothing. All right. Bye. I love you, Justice. Did you call me last night? Yeah. By mistake. Oh! You see that moon. Yeah. What do they say about a full moon? Is that good luck or bad luck? Full moon. They say it is good luck. It is good luck. I will go get him. This whole county was Indians. It was just open land as far as the eye could see. You know how the settlers took over. I heard they won it in a poker game. I am serious here. Ok. They had superior firepower. No. It was more complicated than that. They could not just go in there guns blazing. They were hopelessly outnumbered. Bruce? You know. You are never going to see him again. Still not listening to you. What do you think? Tuckey is going... to do when we gets all that money? You think he is going to rush back here to share it with you. I know Turkey better than anyone. That is right. You do. Every second that you sit in there is another second Tuckey... Has to get away with all that cash. Goddamn. Shut up. I mean, you said it yourself. You know him better than anyone does. Wait. Let us go. What are you doing? Stop. No. No. You thought I was just going to leave. You here all by your lonesome? Just let us go. Quiet. Let us stop. Just... I know things have gotten out of control... But just stop for a second and think about what you are doing. Two people are already dead. Just get out of here. Just... Just go while you still have the chance. We just want to live, and I am not sure that. That is... That is what you want too. You know. You do not want a shoot out or a standoff. Just take what you want and go. That is some coincidence you come in here. I bet you wish you never walked through that door. Please... Please do not kill me. Maybe you should have thought about that before you stuck. Your nose in other People's bees wax. Tuckey. You are not going to kill these people. No. I have done enough killing for today. This is your show. Go on. What your heart tells you. What are you doing? Sam. Please. Please, Sam. Sam? I know she loves you very much. That boy. Please, Sam. No. I figured as much. Do not shoot. We are coming out. This is the police. Come out with your hands above your head. We are fuck. Man. We have you surrounded. Put down your weapon. You have one minute. This is your final warning. Prepare to fire. Fire. There is no way out. Boy. We are coming out. Hold your fire. Get that hallway. I want every room cleared. Mike is dead. We fucked up. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. 7 MINUTES
