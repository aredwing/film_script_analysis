THIS IS BETTER, RIGHT? THE RED SHIRT? [MAN] I THINK IT'S-- YEAH WELL, IT'S VERY CRAMPED-- OOH, THAT IS BETTER, ACTUALLY. IT'S A LOT BETTER? YEAH, THAT LOOKS NICE, ON THE SCREEN. SHOULD I TRY THE...? A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE MAYBE. AGGRESSIVE? NO, THAT'S GOOD. SHOULD I DO BLACK? NO. OH, YEAH. THAT'S WORSE RIGHT? NO. OH. NO. IT'S NOT BAD. [MAN] REALLY? YOU LIKE THAT? THERE'S JUST SOMETHING VERY UNASSUMING ABOUT IT. THE BLUE IS MORE LIKE, HEY, I'M JUST A RELAXED PERSON. THIS IS MORE LIKE I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. YEAH. SO I GOT THIS E-MAIL, AND IT WAS FROM A CURATOR IN BEIRU WHO WAS ASKING ME TO MAKE A FILM FOR THE SHARJAH BIENNIAL, WHICH I HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE. WELL, I LOOKED IT UP, AND IT'S AN EMIRATE IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S RULED BY THIS GUY... THIS GUY. UM, AND... IT SOUNDED-- SHE WAS VERY NICE. SHE SAID REALLY NICE THINGS. SHE SAID SHE HAD ACTUALLY EMAILED ME BEFORE ABOUT SHOWING MY PREVIOUS FILM, WHICH IS CALLED I AM A SEX ADDICT, AT SOME MIDDLE EASTERN FESTIVAL OR SOMETHING, AND IT DIDN' WORK OUT FOR SOME REASON. BUT SO, ANYWAY, THERE WAS A LETTER THAT HAD THESE GUIDELINES THAT WERE VERY-- REALLY STRANGE. PLOT FOR A BIENNIAL WILL CONSIDER THE PRODUCTION OF ART AS A SUBVERSIVE ACT. THE VERY QUESTION WAS, CAN ART BE SUBVERSIVE AND CAN YOU MAKE A CULTURAL EVEN FROM WITHIN AN INSTITUTION, A STATE INSTITUTION, AND HAVE IT BE TRULY SUBVERSIVE. AND IT WAS BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, LIKE, THEY CALL IT "ART SPEAK," YOU KNOW, LIKE IT DOESN' MAKE ANY SENSE. THIS PLOT PROPOSES TO PLACE THE ARTIST WITHIN A WEB OF ETYMOLOGICAL TRACINGS THAT INTERSEC THE NOTION OF TREASON. THE KEYWORDS THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED WERE ALONG THE LINES OF TREASON, COLLABORATION AND CONSPIRACY. SO I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF AN IDEA THAT, YOU KNOW, HAD TO DO WITH TREASON OR AR AS A SUBVERSIVE ACT, AND THOUGH MAYBE LIKE KIDNAPPERS, OR TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT. AND MAYBE LIKE I WOULD WRITE SOME FICTIONAL STORY ABOUT THIS BU LIKE AN ACTION THING KIND OF LIKE A, YOU KNOW, LIKE A STUPID ACTION MOVIE ABOUT TREASON IN THE MIDDLE EAST OR SOMETHING. AND I THOUGHT, "OKAY, THAT COULD BE KIND OF HARD." IT'S UNLIKELY THAT I WOULD TURN OUT VERY WELL. SO THEN I HAD AN IDEA, WHICH WAS, "WELL WHY DON'T YOU MAKE A FILM ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE A FILM?" AND THEN YOU COULD JUS FILM YOURSELF... ACTION! TRYING TO MAKE THE FILM AND THAT WOULD BE A FILM. BUT SO, ANYWAY, I CALLED RASHA ON SKYPE, AND I REALLY WISH I HAD RECORDED THAT CALL, BUT I DIDN'T THINK OF IT. I SAID, "ARE THERE ANY CONSTRAINTS," LIKE "THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?" AND SHE SAID, "NO, YOU'RE TOTALLY FREE TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT." THE REASON WE PICKED YOU IS BECAUSE WE LIKE YOUR WORK AND WE REALLY WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU DO. WE THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING JUST TO SEE WHAT YOU DO. SO I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. LIKE, "REALLY? NO CONSTRAINTS AT ALL?" SO I SAID, YOU KNOW, "REALLY?" AND SHE SAID, "YEAH, REALLY. THERE'S NO CONSTRAINTS AT ALL." AND I PRESSED HER BECAUSE I I JUST DIDN' A PART OF ME DIDN'T TRUST HER AND I REALLY WANTED TO KNOW. SO FINALLY, SHE SAID, "OKAY, FINE. NO FRONTAL NUDITY." I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. I THINK I CAN WORK AROUND THAT." AND THEN SHE SAID, "OH, AND ALSO, NO MAKING FUN OF THE PROPHET MOHAMMED." AT FIRST, I WAS KIND OF LIKE, BUT THEN I WAS LIKE, "OH, WELL, YEAH," LIKE, YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP LIKE SALMAN RUSHDIE, OR AT LEAST I THINK SO. "OKAY, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT." AND THEN THE THIRD THING SHE SAID WAS, AND ALSO, "NO MAKING FUN OF THE SHEIK OF SHARJAH." AND I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT, LIKE, THAT JUS REALLY LIKE, TRIGGERED MY IMAGINATION, LIKE, IT MADE ME DREAM, I GUESS. THE SHEIK OF SHARJAH, LIKE, WHO IS THAT GUY? I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A SHEIK OF SHARJAH. AND IT WAS JUST SUDDENLY, LIKE, AND DON'T MAKE FUN OF HIM. YOU KNOW, SO IT MADE ME REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT THE SHEIK. BUT SO, ANYWAY, ONE DAY, I FIND OUT THAT RASHA WAS GOING TO BE IN NEW YORK AND WOULD I LIKE TO MEET HER FOR LUNCH. AND AS IT WAS APPROACHING, I JUST COULDN'T DECIDE ON WHAT FILM IDEA. SO I GOT STONED THAT NIGHT, TRYING TO THINK OF AN IDEA. BECAUSE USUALLY GETTING STONED HELPS ME TO-- TO BE CREATIVE. HOLD ON. I WAS TRYING TO FIND LIKE AN ARABIC THEME. BUT SO, ANYWAY, ONE IDEA I HAD WAS THAT MAYBE LIKE BECKETT DISAPPEARS, LIKE, HE WALKS OFF. MAYBE HE IS KIDNAPPED. OH, FUCK! OR WHAT IF HE IS KID-- OR IF WE THINK HE IS KIDNAPPED BUT HE IS NOT REALLY KIDNAPPED? HE JUST KIND OF WALKED AWAY AND IS LOST. BUT WE THINK HE'S KIDNAPPED OR WE'RE WORRIED THAT HE'S KIDNAPPED BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE EAS AND BECAUSE WE'RE AMERICANS, AND BECAUSE WE'RE PARANOID AND WE HAVE PARANOID IMAGES OF MIDDLE EASTERNERS, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF THING. OR MAYBE WE SEE ME LOOKING FOR HIM EVERYWHERE AND THEN WE SEE MANDY LOOKING FOR HIM EVERYWHERE OR THE CREW COULD BE LOOKING FOR HIM EVERYWHERE. AND THEN I'M LOOKING IN THE DESERT LIKE, IT'S LIKE A LOOKING FOREVER KIND OF THING OR DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS. SO WHERE WERE WE? OH, YES, AN IDEA, WHICH WAS JUST GO THERE WITHOUT AN IDEA. SO I DIDN'T HAVE ONE. AND JUST, WING IT. YOU KNOW, IMPROVISE IT, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE. AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE I COULD FIND ONLINE. [NARRATOR] SHARJAH IS A HOT DESOLATE SPO ON THE EDGE OF THE SOUTH ARABIAN DESERT. TODAY, IT IS RULED OVER BY A SHEIK WHO IS FRIENDLY TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. OR ON YOUTUBE OR WHATEVER. [POP] SO I WAS GOING TO MEET RASHA FIRS I THOUGHT IF I'M MAKING THE FILM ABOUT MAKING A FILM, I MIGHT AS WELL START NOW AND FILM THE LUNCH. [CAVEH ZAHEDI CHUCKLES] UH-HUH, RIGHT. AND THERE WAS LIKE A LOT OF SMALL TALK. I THINK HE OWNS A PAWNSHOP NOW OR A... PAWN. NO, PAWN. [MAN] PAWN, OKAY. BUT AFTER A WHILE, YOU KNOW, I SORT OF SAID, I CAN ASK, BUT TELL ME WHY. BECAUSE WHEN I ASK, I HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY. [ZAHEDI] AND I THOUGHT, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T DO IT. IF IT BUMS HER OUT, MAYBE I SHOULD DO SOMETHING ELSE. I MEAN, I DON'T WAN TO BUM HER OUT. BUT I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE. I MEAN, I TRIED TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS, BUT NOTHING FELT AS GOOD AS THIS IDEA. I MEAN, IT'S INTERESTING AND IRONIC THAT THERE'S THIS KIND OF LIKE ABSOLUTE FREEDOM, BUT ALSO, THIS VERY INVISIBLE SET OF VERY REAL CONSTRAINTS. AND SO, TO ME, IT'S INTERESTING JUST TO TRY TO LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF THAT A LITTLE BIT. AND THE SHEIK OF SHARJAH IS LIKE THE WIZARD OF OZ IN THIS SCENARIO. AND I DON'T KNOW WHA WHAT'S BEHIND THE CURTAIN, BUT I'M CURIOUS. RIGHT. RIGHT. THE END RESULT WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TWO FILMS: ONE, FOR YOURSELF; AND ONE THAT WOULD BE PUBLICLY, YOU KNOW, EXHIBITED AT THE BIENNIAL. IT'S TRICKY, I THINK. I THINK YOU'RE TAKING A LOT OF RISKS. YEAH. BUT THAT'S WHA YOU LIKE TO DO? YEAH. UH-HUH. CAN I GET THE CHECK? THANK YOU. OKAY, IT'S GOOD. WAS IT GOOD? I DON'T KNOW. SHIT. SO WE FLEW TO SHARJAH. SO THE SHARJAH AR FOUNDATION SENT A DRIVER NAMED MANSOUR, TO PICK US UP. SO THEN WE'RE IN THE CAR, GOING TO THE HOTEL FROM THE AIRPORT. AND MANDY SAYS... [WHISPERING] AND I WAS LIKE, WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? AND SHE WAS LIKE... AND, I THINK SHE WAS SCARED. AND I THINK MAYBE HER BEING SCARED MAYBE MADE ME SCARED, LIKE, WELL, SHOULD I BE WORRIED? SHOULD I BE SCARED? MANSOUR, ARE WE DID WE GO IN A CIRCLE? DID WE JUST GO IN A CIRCLE? MANSOUR? MANSOUR? MANSOUR? AND I THOUGHT WHAT IF HE'S NOT ANSWERING ME NO BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HEAR ME, BUT BECAUSE HE'S KIDNAPPING US. AND SOMEHOW, EITHER HE ISN'T REALLY MANSOUR. HE JUST LIKE KILLED MANSOUR. HE HAD PRETENDED TO BE MANSOUR. HE'S REALLY A KIDNAPPER. BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU THINK FROM LIKE HOLLYWOOD MOVIES, WHAT YOU SEE. THE AMERICANS MUST DIE. SO I JUST HAD THIS LITTLE MOMEN OF LIKE, WHAT IF HE'S KIDNAPPING US? IT WAS JUST LIKE A THOUGHT. IT WAS LIKE A SPLIT SECOND. AND THEN AS SOON AS IT HAPPENED, I WAS LIKE, NO, NO, NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. HE'S LIKE HE IS NOT GOING TO KIDNAP US. THAT'S JUST LIKE A-- BUT I THOUGHT, BUT THAT WAS AN INTERESTING LITTLE PARANOID FANTASY I HAD, LIKE, THAT MIGH BE A GOOD SCENE IN A MOVIE. LIKE, I SOR OF HAD AN IMAGE OF HIM, LIKE, PULLING UP IN FRON OF LIKE A DARK WAREHOUSE OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, AND SAYING "WAIT HERE", OR SOMEBODY ELSE COMES OUT. I DON'T KNOW, BUT I JUS HAD THIS LITTLE IMAGE. AND I FELT, WELL, I COULD JUST FILM A SCENE WHERE WE CAN RE-ENAC THAT IMAGE. YOU KNOW, I'M MAKING A FILM, RIGHT? FOR THE SHARJAH FOUNDATION. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ACT IN IT? AS AN ACTOR? YEAH. COULD I DO A SCENE WITH YOU ACTING IN IT? YEAH? OKAY. DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE SHARJAH ART MUSEUM IS? THE ART WHAT? ART MUSEUM? GO THERE STRAIGHT. YOU SEE THE DOOR? THEN GO TO THE RIGHT. GREAT. THANK YOU. [MAN] NICE TO MEET YOU FINALLY. THAT'S ME. THIS IS MICHAEL. HELLO MICHAEL, NICE TO MEET YOU. I'M CAMILLE. THIS IS COLIN. COLIN, HELLO. NICE TO MEET YOU. UH, THE QUESTION? YEAH. HAVE YOU SEEN OTHER HOTELS? NO. BECAUSE... THEY'RE ALL THAT WAY? WELL... [LAUGHS] [WOMAN] [ZAHEDI] SO IN SHARJAH, THERE ARE NO TRAFFIC LIGHTS. AND SO PEOPLE JUST LIKE RUN ACROSS THE STREET AND THEY HOPE THEY DON'T GET HIT, AND IT'S KIND OF SCARY. AND MANDY WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT BECKETT. IT IS A BIT LONGER, BUT YEAH. [WOMAN] PEOPLE WON'T CROSS THE STREET. IF YOU JUST DO THIS WITH YOUR HANDS, PEOPLE WILL STOP. YOU JUST HAVE TO ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THE DRIVER AND JUST DO THIS. ONCE HE STOPS, YOU CROSS. THAT'S THE SAME IN ITALY. YEAH. I THINK WE WANT TO FILM HIM GETTING HIT BY A CAR. [THUD] WHO, THIS GUY. CAMILLE, YEAH. HE'S GOING TO GO LIKE THAT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? NO. OH, MY GOD. NO. I WAS FEELING GOOD ABOUT THIS VACATION. FOR ME IT WAS LIKE BEING ALL TOGETHER... YEAH. AND LIKE HAVING THAT, A GROUP EXPERIENCE AND LIKE... MAKING FRIENDS AND JUST LIKE WHATEVER THAT INTERSTITIAL MOMENTS AND HAVING BECKETT RUN AROUND. LIKE, I FEEL LIKE MORE WEIGHT ON ME TO TAKE CARE OF BECKETT ALSO, BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE DIRTY HERE. AND LIKE, THERE WAS LIKE THIS GROSS SMUDGE NEXT TO THE BED THAT I HAD TO CLEAN OFF THE WALL AND, LIKE, I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW, IT'S LIKE SUPER DIRTY, AND DEPRESSING AND LIKE JUST KIND OF MAKES ME FEEL BAD. WHAT? [LAUGHING] I HAD AN IDEA FOR THE KIDNAPPING SCENE. I THINK MANSOUR SHOULD JUS DROP US OFF AND LIKE, WHERE WE'RE GOING YOU GUYS HAVE TO PICK SOMETHING UP. AND THEN HE GOES OUT INTO AN APARTMENT. I THINK IT CAN EITHER BE LIKE CAMILLE'S APARTMEN OR HIS APARTMENT, ACTUALLY. [MAN] WELL, EITHER WAY. AND THEN I THOUGHT A WOMAN IN A BURQA COULD COME OUT OR A MAN IN A BURQA. WE DON'T KNOW. SOMEONE IN A BURQA COMES OUT. AND THEY TALK. AND THEN THE BURQA PERSON COMES TO THE WINDOW AND THEN PULLS OU THE TOY GUN AND KNOCKS ON THE DOOR WITH THE GUN. [MAN] ...A GUN I WOULDN'T GIVE BECKETT UP, SO HOW ARE THEY GOING TO RIP HIM FROM ME? THEY'RE NOT GOING TO... [ZAHEDI] OH, OKAY. YES, AND I DON' THINK THEY WILL. [MAN] THE KIDNAPPING DOESN'T HAPPEN YET. IT ENDS. YEAH, IT ENDS. YOU DON'T SEE WHAT HAPPENS. NO, NO. THAT'S THE END OF THAT. MANDY'S DYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD. A DEAD BODY. CATCH UP. WITH AN APPLE ON HER. LIKE SNOW WHITE. [ZAHEDI] SO WE'RE SHOOTING A MOVIE OVER THERE. WE'RE MAKING A FILM WITH THE CAMERA AND STUFF. YEAH, BUT WE NEED SOME ACTORS FOR OUR MOVIE. OKAY. WE'RE SHOOTING A MOVIE. WE'RE MAKING A MOVIE. WE NEED ACTORS TO ACT IN OUR MOVIE. INTERESTED? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ACT IN OUR MOVIE? NO? OKAY. IS THAT A NO? [ZAHEDI] [MEN CHANTING] OKAY. DADDY, UP! I GOT YOU. THEY'RE ALL PRAYING. THEY'RE ALL PRAYING. SHOULD WE GO? YEAH. YES, I WILL ACTUALLY WRITE THEM DOWN OR YOU WANT TO...? TELL ME. I'LL TELL YOU? YEAH. OKAY, SO LET'S GO SIT THERE. CAN YOU ALSO... TEACH YOU HOW TO PRAY? YEAH. OKAY. OKAY, ASK ME. WE JUST NEEDED SOME PEOPLE TO ACT IN OUR MOVIE. SORRY? WE JUST NEED SOME PEOPLE TO ACT IN OUR MOVIE. SAY AGAIN? WE NEED... ...PEOPLE TO ACT IN THE MOVIE. YES. YEAH. WHAT KIND OF MOVIE ARE YOU DOING? WELL, IT'S A COMBINATION DOCUMENTARY AND FICTION, BUT THERE ARE SOME SCENES WHERE WE NEED SOME KIDNAPPERS. KIDNAP? HMM. YEAH? YEAH? OKAY. YEAH. DO YOU REALLY? [ZAHEDI] SO, BASICALLY, HE'S GOING STOP AT A PLACE THAT'S SCARY, THEN GO TO A DOORWAY. AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT IN A BURQA. AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO TALK, AND THEN HE'S GOING TO GO LIKE THAT. OKAY, HE'S GOOD. AND THEN-- AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A DOOR OPENING, AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE AT THE DOOR WITH THE BURQA SUDDENLY, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GUN, WHICH WE GOT FOR YOU. YOU HAVE A GUN FOR ME. YEAH. IT'S IN THE CAR. OH, IT'S NOT REAL? IT'S A TOY GUN. [RATTLING] THE RED IS PRETTY PROMINENT. [WOMAN] YEAH. AND THEN IT ENDS. AND THEN WE'RE BACK IN THE TRIP FROM THE AIRPORT. IT'S VERY PLOTTY, RIGHT. BUT THE OTHER STUFF ISN'T PLOTTY AT ALL. SO IT'S LIKE A MIX OF THE TWO THINGS. OKAY? YEAH. LET'S DO IT. BECAUSE LIKE-- OOH. OOH. ARE YOU OKAY, SWEETIE? ARE YOU OKAY, SWEETIE? WELL, DID THAT HURT? OH. OH, MY SWEETIE PIE. OH, GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB. COME HERE LITTLE BOY. COME ON. WHY THE BURQA? JUST BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IGNORANT... OH, OKAY. ...STEREOTYPE. YEAH, YEAH, IT IS. YES. AND THEN WRAP THIS AROUND THIS SIDE. ARE YOU SURE IT GOES ON THE FOREHEAD? NO, BUT I THINK SO. THIS HAS TO THIS COMES DOWN BEFORE... NO, PEOPLE WEAR IT WITH GLASSES UNDERNEATH THEM. OKAY. THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS. YES, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THOSE OFF FIRST. [MUSIC] [ZAHEDI] SO WE'RE JUST KIND OF DRIVING RANDOMLY AROUND SHARJAH LATE AT NIGHT, AND I SAW PLACES OH, THAT LOOKS GOOD. LET'S SHOOT IT RIGHT THERE. AND WE WERE JUST, YOU KNOW, FIGURING OUT THE SHOT. TRY NOT TO LOOK TOO-- TOO LIKE A CREEPY OUTSIDE SO THAT THE FAMILY DOESN'T COME OUT AND YELL AT US. YEAH. WELL, JUS I'M SAYING STAND MAYBE ON THIS SIDE OF THE FENCE UNTIL WE ACTUALLY SHOOT IT, THEN... OH, YEAH. SO WHEN YOU SEE OUR CAR COME ROUND YOU CAN JUST GO INSIDE INTO-- YES... JUST THAT LITTLE DOORWAY. AND JUST DUCK AROUND THE CORNER. [CHATTER] WE HAVE TO SHOW HIM THE BLOCKING OF THE MOVEMENTS. [CHATTER] SORRY? THIS ONE. OH REALLY? THIS IS THE WHAT? SHEIKHA. YOU CAN FACE THE PROBLEM FOR THIS. YEAH, HIS DAUGHTER'S HOUSE. YEAH. SO WE HAVE THE LETTER STILL? DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT? FOR SECURITY REASON... BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THAT WITHOU BECAUSE SHE'S NOT HERE. AND TO CALL HER, TO SAY THAT WE ARE AT... I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW HER, RIGHT? YOU MET HER, RIGHT? WE'RE NOT GOING INSIDE AT ALL. WELL, WHAT'S THE WORS THAT CAN HAPPEN? SO WE LEFT. AND I WAS BUMMED. WHAT IF... IT WOULD BE... IS THERE ANY WAY... RIGHT. MAYBE THIS IS PALESTINIAN MENTALITY WORKING AS WELL, YOU KNOW. I'M SORRY? AHAH, AHAH. RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT. RIGHT. YEAH, BUT THAT'S-- AGAIN-- A CAMERA AND A GUN IS DANGEROUS. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO SHOOTING, IT'S DANGEROUS. YEAH. BUT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO FOR THE MOVIE? WE SHOULD SHOOT THAT SCENE. WE SHOULD RE-ENACT THE SCENE OF US TRYING TO SHOO THE SCENE THAT WAS ALREADY A RE-ENACTMENT OF A FANTASY AND THE POLICE COME. OR MAYBE WHILE WE'RE ARGUING, THE POLICE COME. BUT, ANYWAY, THE POLICE COME. WHERE? IN FRONT OF THE MUSEUM. IN FRONT OF THE ART MUSEUM, THE SHARJAH ART MUSEUM. IT'S FOR THE SHARJAH ART MUSEUM. PERMISSION TO FILM FOR US, BUT WE WANT TO USE A POLICE VAN. CARD? YEAH. OH, ID CARD. IT'S IN THERE. DOES THAT LOOK GOOD? IS THE WHITE ONE BETTER? MAYBE BLACK AND WHITE INSTEAD OF BROWN AND WHITE. SO I THINK IT'S EITHER BLACK AND WHITE, OR THE WHITE, OR THIS. MICHAEL? WHAT DO YOU THINK? I SAY BROWN OR WHITE. DO YOU WANT ME TO OPEN? NO, NO. I DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTANDS. CAN I SEE THE PICTURE? INTERESTING. IT'S HARD TO DECIDE, ISN'T IT? YES. SO WE WENT TO THE SHARJAH ART FOUNDATION TO ASK FOR PERMISSION FROM THE SHEIKHA TO SHOO IN FRONT OF HER HOUSE, AND SOME POLICE CARS AND SOME POLICEMEN TO ACT IN OUR MOVIE. AND THEY LIKE TALKED TO FATIMAH. OH. SHE'S NOT HERE YET. OKAY. FATIMAH WAS NEVER THERE. I'M LIKE, WHERE IS SHE? YOU KNOW, THEY SAID, OH, SHE'S PRAYING. WHICH IS GREAT IF YOU PRAY ALL THE TIME, BUT, LIKE, SHE WAS NEVER AT HER DESK. YEAH. COME ON, SHE'S NOT PRAYING ALL DAY LONG EVERY DAY. SHE LEFT. [LAUGHING] OH. OKAY. OKAY. YAZAN SAID THAT YOU WERE THE PERSON WE SHOULD... NO PHOTOS? OF YOU? NO, NO, NO, NO. YEAH. NO PHOTOS. YOU ALREADY ASKED THEM? UH-HUH. WELL, WE'RE JUST GOING TO SHOOT ON THE STREET. WE'RE JUST GOING TO SHOOT ON THE STREE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. OKAY. YEAH. OH. THE THINGS THEY WOULD SAY DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. YOU KNOW, LIKE, THEY WOULD GIVE A REASON FOR SOMETHING, BUT IT MADE NO SENSE. SO YOU'RE LIKE, OKAY, WELL, THEY'RE LYING. AND THEN YOU'RE FALLING INTO THE CLICHE KIND OF THING OF THEY ALL LIE OR SOMETHING, BUT THEY REALLY KIND OF DO. I MEAN, I CAN SAY THIS BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE FROM IRAN. SO I'M IRANIAN, BASICALLY. I MEAN, I WAS BORN IN THE US, BUT I'VE SEEN IT. I'VE SEEN IT IN ACTION, IN THE CULTURE, LIKE, YOU KNOW. AND THEY DON'T CALL IT LYING. THEY CALL IT, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER. POLITENESS, I GUESS. BUT, UM, YOU KNOW, IT'S LYING. AND WHAT ABOUT THE JAIL AND THE POLICE VAN? CAN WE USE THOSE? SO NO ONE HAS ASKED THEM FOR THAT YET? JUST SHOOTING THE-- WHAT DID THEY SAY 'NO' TO EXACTLY? THE 'NO' WAS TO WHAT? WHAT? YOU KNOW I DIDN' WANT TO EMBARRASS HER, LIKE I MEAN, I'M EMBARRASSING HER NOW, I GUESS. BUT I DIDN'T WAN TO EMBARRASS HER AT THE TIME. HI, SO... UM, AND WE JUST NEED... TWO BODYGUARDS, YOU TOLD ME THE LAST TIME. YEAH, WE WANTED TO SHOO A SCENE IN FRONT OF THE SHEIK'S DAUGHTER'S HOUSE. SHEIK? SHEIK'S DAUGHTER. WHAT'S HER NAME? WHAT'S THE NAME OF...? THE DAUGHTER. THE DAUGHTER? OH, HOOR. YES, HOOR. OKAY. HOOR? YEAH. WANT TO SHOOT A SCENE IN FRONT OF HER HOUSE. HOUSE? OKAY. I THOUGHT SHE SAID THAT SHE ALREADY ASKED, AND THEY SAID NO. IS THAT-- DID I MISUNDERSTAND ABOUT USING THE HOUSE? DID SHE EVEN ASK? I WILL CHECK WITH HER AGAIN. UH-HUH. AND THEN THE LAST THING WAS JUST, WE WERE WONDERING IF WE COULD ALSO MAYBE USE THE SHEIK HIMSELF IN THE MOVIE. YEAH, OKAY. IT WILL BE REALLY HARD, YOU KNOW. YES. OKAY, OKAY. OKAY? I FORGOT SOMETHING ELSE THAT HAPPENED. ONE DAY I'M AT THE SHARJAH ART FOUNDATION IN PART TRYING TO GE PERMISSION FOR SOMETHING. AND I BROUGHT ALONG THE RELEASE FORM FOR YAZAN TO SIGN, RIGHT? I SAID, I'M SORRY I FORGO TO GIVE YOU A RELEASE FORM. YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS. AND HE SAID... OH. AND I WAS LIKE, REALLY? YOU'LL GET IN TROUBLE FOR THAT? AND I SAID, NO, NO, NO. I WAS TOLD THERE WERE CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS. AND I SAID, "WELL, IF YOU'RE "GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE, THEN I'LL TAKE IT OUT. I MEAN, IT'S FINE." AND I STARTED TO SENSE LIKE THIS INCREASING TENSION BETWEEN THE SHARJAH ART FOUNDATION AND US. YEAH. YOU SEE, THE PUBLIC SPACE HERE IS PEOPLE IN PUBLIC HAVE A CERTAIN IMAGE AND PRIVATE IS SOMETHING ELSE, BUT THEY DON'T LIKE TO-- THEY FEEL IT'S STOLEN FROM THEM. I ALSO FORGOT THIS ONE PART, YOU KNOW. MANSOUR TOLD US THAT HIS SON WAS REALLY EXCITED THAT HIS FATHER WAS ACTING IN A MOVIE. I JUST HAVE TO PICK SOMETHING UP. I JUST HAVE TO... PICK SOMETHING UP. ...PICK SOMETHING UP. [WOMAN] YES. CLOSE. AGAIN. I JUST HAVE TO PICK PICK SOME... SORRY. IT'LL HELP HIM... YES. I JUST HAVE TO PICK-PICK... TELL ME WHAT-- ARE YOU SHOOTING? AND I WAS THINKING, MAYBE WE CAN PUT THE SON IN THE MOVIE. MAYBE THE SON WOULD ENJOY BEING IN THE MOVIE, TOO, WITH HIS DAD. MAYBE WE COULD WRITE A SCENE FOR THE SON TO BE IN AND ALSO BESIDES HIS DAD. SO I THOUGHT, WELL, WE SHOULD ASK HIS KID. SO YOU SAID YOUR SON IS IN PAKISTAN? SO HE LIVES THERE ALL THE TIME? DOES HE COME HERE OFTEN? YEAH. WILL HE BE HERE FOR THE BIENNIAL? YEAH, SOMETIME. NICE JOB. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. I ASSUME. YEAH. SWEETIE, LET ME PUT THIS ON NOW. NO, NO. YES, YES, YES. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE MOVIE. IT'S FOR THE MOVIE. NO, NO, NO. COME, ON, BECKETT, JUST THE SHIRT. IT WON'T KILL YOU. OKAY. YES. NO. NO...

OKAY, FINE. OKAY, FINE. OKAY, FINE. FINE. YOU WIN. YOU WIN. SO YOU JUST NEED TO WASH YOUR HANDS? OH, FACE AND FEET? YEAH. [WATER RUNNING] THE MOUTH? MOUTH. BISMILLAH. BISMILLAH. OH, YOU PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH? YEAH. YOU BLOW IT OUT. SO, TO START A PRAYER, WE SAY, ALLAHU AKBAR, WHICH IS GOD IS GREA OR GOD IS THE GREATEST. ALLAHU AKBAR-- BY RAISING THE HANDS LIKE THIS. ALLAHU AKBAR. ALLAHU AKBAR. THEN WE PUT OUR HANDS HERE. RIGHT OVER LEFT. MM-HMM. AND THEN, PROSTRATION. THE ELBOWS ARE RAISED. IT'S OKAY. JUST LEAVE IT THERE IF IT FALLS OFF? THE ELBOWS ARE RAISED. OH, LIKE THIS? YEAH. YES, LIKE THIS. YOU JUST LEAVE IT. SOME PEOPLE WILL TRY TO PICK IT UP, BUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, NOT TO BREAK THE RHYTHM OF-- UH-HUH, IS THAT TRUE NOW TOO OR JUST DURING THE PRAYER? JUST DURING THE REAL PRAYER. DURING THE REAL PRAYER. YES. SALAAM ALAYKUM. SALAAM. SALAAM ALAYKUM. SALAAM. SALAAM ALAYKUM. SALAAM. STOP. OKAY STOP. STOP. YOU HAVE TO STOP. SORRY. YEAH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, CAMILLE TOLD ME THE STORY ONCE ABOUT LIKE, THERE WAS THIS FILM ABOUT MOHAMMAD THAT WAS MADE. I THINK IT WAS CALLED THE MESSENGER. IT S LIKE A BIG BUDGE SPECTACLE FILM. AND THE WAY THEY GO AROUND THE PROHIBITION AGAINST REPRESENTING MOHAMMAD IN SUNNI ISLAM-- WHICH IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS IN SHIITE ISLAM, WHICH IS WHAT IRANIANS ARE, WHICH IS WHAT MY PARENTS ARE AND THE TRADITION THAT I'M FROM-- IS THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW MOHAMMAD'S FACE. IT WAS ALWAYS A POV SHOT. NO ONE EVER KNEW IT WAS MOHAMMAD, IT WAS LIKE THROUGH HIS EYES. AND APPARENTLY, THERE'S A GUY IN THERE WHO'S LIKE THE BAD GUY IN THE MOVIE AND WHEN PEOPLE WOULD SEE HIM ON THE STREE AFTER THE MOVIE CAME OUT, THEY WOULD LIKE THROW ROCKS AT HIM AND SPI AT HIM AND LIKE, THREATEN HIM. AND CAMILLE EXPLAINED TO ME LIKE, IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THAT NOT ALL PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT FILM IS. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT'S PRETEND. AND THIS GUY COULDN' GET A JOB, THE ACTOR. THE HEAD OF THE COUNTRY HAD TO LIKE GIVE HIM A SPECIAL ANNUAL STIPEND SO THAT HE COULD, HIM AND HIS FAMILY COULD LIKE LIVE, BECAUSE EVERYONE HATED HIM FOR PLAYING THIS VILLAIN IN THIS MOVIE AND NO BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND FICTION. HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? HI, HOW ARE YOU? HOW DO WE GET ON THE BOAT? COME. BABY COME. IT'S OKAY. NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'RE GOING TO GO ON THE BOAT. HE WANTS TO GO ON THE BOAT. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY. YOU GO FIRS AND THEN I'LL HAND... NO, YOU GO FIRST AND I'LL HAND BECKETT TO YOU. GO FIRST. [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE] THIS IS YOUR WIFE. I'M FROM IRAN. YES, BUT YOU-- YES. YES, WIFE. [SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE] YES! FROM NEW YORK. [ZAHEDI] SO, WE'RE MAKING A MOVIE. DO YOU GUYS WANT TO BE IN IT? [CHILD] YEAH. THERE'S ALSO STORY STUFF. I ALSO WANT TO... [CHILDREN] YES. SO, WE'LL SEE YOU MAYBE TOMORROW NIGH OR THE NEXT NIGHT, BUT WE'RE HERE ALL THE TIME, AND WE'LL THINK OF A SCENE FOR YOU GUYS TO ACT IN, OKAY? OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. BYE-BYE. SEE YOU GUYS. BYE. BYE. WE DON' HAVE A MUSICAL SEQUENCE. LIKE IN HOLLYWOOD MUSICAL SEQUENCE? YEAH, BUT LIKE MAYBE ARABIC. [MIDDLE EASTERN] THAT SEEMS LIKE A WHOLE PRODUCTION. I KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. WELL... YOU HAVE TO MAKE, LIKE, CHOREOGRAPHY. [CHUCKLES] LIKE PROBABLY THE 13-YEAR OLD INDIAN GIRL COULD TEACH ME, LIKE, BOLLYWOOD CHOREOGRAPHY. WELL, MAYBE WITH THE INDIAN KIDS. THEY COULD DO A BOLLYWOOD THING. BUT WE COULD CHOREOGRAPH THE KIDS DOING A MUSICAL NUMBER AROUND SOCCER. [WOMAN] WE HAVE WAY TOO MANY THINGS. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE WE COULD USE THE CALL TO PRAYER. [MAN SINGING ADHAN] [ZAHEDI CHANTS] WELL, MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE VERY-- MAYBE IT WOULD BE MORE PRAY. [ADHAN] ACTUALLY, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. [MAN] WHAT ABOUT LIKE YOU-- WHY DON'T WE USE THE PRAYER CHOREOGRAPHY? [MIDDLE EASTERN] [MAN] [WOMAN] HOW MANY-- I DON'T KNOW. IT PROBABLY IS. READY, ONE, TWO THREE BOW. I MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING SO CENTRAL ABOU THIS PRAYER HERE. IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE CENTER OF THIS PLACE, IT'S LIKE FIVE TIMES A DAY, EVERYBODY STOPS WHA THEY'RE DOING AND THEY DO THIS PRAYER WHICH IS RITUALIZED. I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT ART DOES. ART DOESN'T JUST BOW. ART HAS A GAZE THAT HAS COMPLEXITY AND DISTANCE, RIGHT? SO REALLY, I THINK THAT'S WHAT-- THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING TO DO. THAT'S WHAT ART SHOULD DO. IT SHOULDN'T JUST LIKE BE ONLY REVERENT TO THE SACRED. IT SHOULD ALSO, LIKE, BE PLAYFUL WITH THE SACRED. HIGH. HIGH STEP. HIGH. HIGH STEP. [REPEATING] ACTION. GOT IT? YES. OKAY. IT WAS GOOD. THANK YOU. [ZAHEDI] BUT ANYWAY, SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE COURTYARD WHEN WE WERE SHOOTING COMPLAINED TO THE SHARJAH ART FOUNDATION THAT WE WERE NOT ACTING SACREDLY TOWARDS PRAYER. HE SAID THAT PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE FREAKED OU ABOUT ALL THE SHOOTING AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING WORRIED ABOUT IT, AND HIS WIFE WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIM LOSING HIS JOB IF HE SAYS CERTAIN THINGS THAT MAYBE AREN'T ORTHODOX. LARA WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING WITH THIS FOOTAGE. EVERYONE IS JUST PARANOID AND, UM, HE JUST SAID-- HE SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THE LINES ARE HIMSELF BECAUSE HE'S A GUEST HERE, BU HE'S WORRIED THAT IF WE'RE FILMING HIM TALKING ABOUT ISLAM AND MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF ISLAM THAN THEIR SHEIK'S BRAND OF ISLAM, THEN HE'LL BE LIKE OFFENDED, AND HE'S GOT A GUEST VISA FOR THREE MONTHS, AND THEY COULD EASILY NOT RENEW IT. SO EVERYONE'S JUST LIKE... WORRIED. DO YOU GUYS KNOW HOW TO DANCE AT ALL? UM... THERE'S NO A LOT OF DANCING... [ZAHEDI] AND SO, ZUZU ASKED THE WOMEN WHO WORKED AT THE MUSEUM IF THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO BE IN OUR CHOREOGRAPHY SCENE, AND THEY SAID, YES, SO WE SCHEDULED A DAY WHEN THEY ALL COULD DO IT. AND SOMEHOW ALL THE WOMEN CHANGED THEIR MINDS OR THEY SAID THEY FORGO TO BRING THEIR BURQAS. I DON'T KNOW, THEY ALL HAD AN EXCUSE. EXCEPT ONE WOMAN WHO WAS EGYPTIAN. APPARENTLY, EGYPTIANS AREN'T AS UPTIGHT. [ZAHEDI ON SET] OKAY, LET'S TRY THIS OKAY, GO. RIGHT, RIGH LEFT, LEF RIGHT, RIGHT. LEFT, LEFT. [REPEATING] THAT LOOKS GOOD. A LITTLE MORE, MICHAEL... ZUZU'S GOOD. [ZAHEDI] YEAH, SO SHE WAS FINE WITH THE CHOREOGRAPHY SCENE BECAUSE THE OTHER ONES WERE NOT, AND I THINK THEY WERE GETTING UPSET. WHEN THEY REALIZED IT WAS LIKE WESTERN DANCING, THEY LIKE GOT REALLY UPSET. [ZAHEDI] THEN TWO OF THEM WALKED THROUGH OUR FRAME AND I THINK THEY SAW WHAT WE WERE DOING AND THEY TOLD THE OTHER ONES, AND THE OTHER ONES WERE LIKE REALLY MAD, AND THEY BASICALLY TOLD THE EGYPTIAN WOMAN TO STOP DOING I AND THEY WERE MAD AT HER AND I THINK WERE WORRIED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LOSE HER JOB JUST FOR DANCING IN OUR MOVIE SCENE. IT'S THE THING I HATE MOS IN THE WORLD IS PEOPLE WHO TRY TO LIKE GET IN THE WAY OF MY FILMS, BECAUSE MY FILMS ARE LIKE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME. I MEAN, MY SON IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME BUT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT PEOPLE, FILMMAKING IS THE MOS IMPORTANT THING TO ME. IT'S JUST VERY SALVATIONAL TO ME, YOU KNOW. IF I CAN ONLY MAKE THIS FILM OR MAKE IT GOOD, EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY. IT'S LIKE, I'LL BE SAVED. IT'S ALMOST RELIGIOUS. WHEREAS IF I DON'T SUCCEED OR IF THE FILM IS THWARTED LIKE I FEEL DAMNED OR EVERYTHING IS BAD. IT'S NOT JUST LIKE ONE THING IS BAD, EVERYTHING IS BAD AND LIFE HAS NO MEANING AND I FEEL WORTHLESS. I HAVE LOW SELF-ESTEEM, I THINK, IS THE TRUTH. SO FILMMAKING GIVES ME SOME SELF-ESTEEM BUT WITHOUT IT, I DON'T HAVE ANY. AND THEN, WHEN I WAS AT THE FERRIS WHEEL, SORT OF LIKE LOCATION SCOUTING OR WHATEVER, JUST LOOKING AROUND, I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS THIS BANQUET. NO, WE JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THE FERRIS WHEEL. YOU CAN GO THERE? YES, WE WANT TO LOOK AT IT. JUST LOOK AT IT. YES. [ZAHEDI] SO I THOUGHT, WELL, I WONDER IF ONE OF THOSE GUYS IS THE SHEIK OF SHARJAH, LIKE HE MIGHT BE THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH RIGHT THERE, LIKE IN THE SAME SPACE BU I COULDN'T REALLY GET TO HIM. WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO, INTERRUPT HIS BANQUET? EXCUSE ME. [CHUCKLES] WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS IS IT'S SO WEIRD AND RANDOM THAT WE STUMBLED UPON THIS. I FEEL LIKE IF I COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INCORPORATE THIS RANDOM EVEN INTO THE NARRATIVE, RIGHT? SO, WELL, ONE OF THEM COULD JUS BE THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH AND WE DO SOMETHING WITH HIM BUT IT'S KIND OF FUNNY THAT THEY'RE ALL THERE, RIGHT? IT WAS LIKE A BANQUET. LIKE EVERY YEAR, THEY HAVE LIKE A, ALL THE SHEIKS GET TOGETHER. [MAN] [ZAHEDI] BUT... ALL THE SHEIKS ARE KIDNAPPED AT THE SAME TIME. AND IF THEY KIDNAP ALL OF THEM, IT COULD BE WORTH A LOT. [MAN] YES. THEY WANT BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS. THEY WANT THE RIGH TO BECOME CITIZENS AFTER 30 YEARS. [MAN] THAT'S GOOD. I KNOW. [WOMAN] SUPER. HE'S GOING TO GET FIRED. OR LIKE MANSOUR IS LEADING THIS LIKE PAKISTANI-LED LABOR RESISTANCE THING. ALL THE INDIAN KIDS. [WOMAN] ALL THE INDIAN KIDS. [MAN] WE COULD JUST LIKE USE THEM AS, LIKE, THIS ARMY OF CHILDREN. [WOMAN] OH, YOU GUYS ARE MAKING IT SO POLITICAL THOUGH. THAT'S SO SCARY. [MAN] PLAYFUL, ABSURD WAY. [ZAHEDI] AND SOMEHOW, WE FOIL THE PLOT. BECKETT, SOMEHOW, IS INSTRUMENTAL. [MAN] BECKETT LEADS ALL THE CHILDREN AGAINST HIM. AND THE SHEIKS, IN GRATITUDE FOR SAVING THEM FROM THE RANSOMERS, CHANGE THE LABOR LAWS. [WOMAN] WOW. [MAN] YEAH. [CHUCKLES] I REALLY WANTED THE SHEIK TO PLAY THE SHEIK, AND I THOUGHT, OH, WELL, THIS WOULD BE WHAT I ASK THE SHEIK-- YOU KNOW, ASK HIM IF HE'LL PLAY HIMSELF IN THE MOVIE, AND I ACTUALLY WROTE HIM A LETTER AT SOME POINT, ASKING IF HE'D BE IN THE MOVIE, AND THERE'S NO ANSWER. EVERY DAY, I'D SAY, WAS THERE ANY ANSWER? NO, THERE WASN'T AN ANSWER. SO AT SOME POINT I ASKED THIS GUY AND I THOUGH THIS GUY LOOKS AMAZING, JUST HIS FACE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND STRIKING AND HAD A GLOW, LIKE A SPIRITUAL GLOW THAT I THINK YOU COULD FEEL. THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THIS GUY. ALLAHU GOD? ALLAHU. [MAN] ALLAHU? ALLAHU. [CHATTERING] [ZAHEDI] YES, I KIND OF KNOW. I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR A WHILE. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THAT STUFF. [SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE] OKAY, NO PROBLEM. OH, YEAH? GREAT. DO YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN REACH HIM? NO, I DON'T KNOW. SURE. YEAH, OKAY. ZERO, FIVE, ZERO... ZERO, FIVE, ZERO... ALSO, WE NEEDED KIDNAPPERS. SO THERE WAS THIS GUY NAMED HEMADI WHO WAS AN ARTIS FROM IRAQ AND HE HAD A STUDIO RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WHERE COLIN AND MICHAEL WERE STAYING. AND WE THOUGHT HE'D BE GOOD FOR THE KIDNAPPER. NO SHE'S NOT BEING IT. IT'S THE SHEIK. SHEIKH OF SHARJAH. OH. SHEIKH OF SHARJAH IS BEING KIDNAPPED. YOU CANNOT REPLACE ANOTHER BODY FOR THIS? NO, WE WANT YOU. MAN, DO I LOOK LIKE I'M A KILLER? HOW I, WE COULD NEVER. YOU LOOK GREAT. - YES? - YEAH. HE SEEMED EVIL. LIKE HE HAD THESE LONG FINGERNAILS LIKE AN EVIL PERSON IN A SILENT MOVIE OR SOMETHING. SO I THOUGHT, "HE'LL BE GOOD," AND ALSO, WE'RE TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER KIDNAPPER. AND WE FOUND THIS GUY. WE WERE SHOOTING ANOTHER SCENE. ACTION! AND AS WE'RE SHOOTING THIS, THIS GUY COMES UP TO US. HE WANTS TO ACT IN THE MOVIE. OKAY. I AM EGYPTIAN. GREAT. WELL, ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW. ACTION! HE CAN DO A DOUBLE. GREAT. THANK YOU. AND I FELT FOR HIM. I KNEW HE WANTED TO BE IN THE MOVIES. YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEAS FOR WHAT WE COULD USE THAT EGYPTIAN GUY FOR? I THINK HE LIKES TO DO STUNTS. YEAH. HE COULD BE THE STAND-IN FOR ANY OF OUR CHARACTERS. BUT, YEAH, WE SHOULD THINK OF SOMETHING... YEAH. HE SAID HE LIKES-- HE CAN FALL. WHAT WAS HE SAYING? DID YOU CATCH IT? SHOULDN'T HE BE ONE OF THE... RANSOMERS? RANSOMERS. YEAH. AND THEN THE POLICE TRY TO CATCH HIM AND HE LIKE-- YEAH, HE'LL FALL ON HIS BUTT. ROLL, ROLL OVER, JUMP OUT A WINDOW. HE'S THE ONE THAT GETS AWAY. ALL THE OTHERS ARE CAPTURED, AND HE'S THE ONE THAT GETS AWAY. AND WE JUST SEE HIM GOING AROUND A CORNER. OKAY. SO WE'RE FILMING CAMILLE GETTING HIT BY THE CAR. AND THE KIDNAPPERS ARE DRIVING THE CAR BECAUSE THEY'VE JUS FLED THE SCENE OF THE CRIME WITH THE RANSOM MONEY. SO THEY'RE GOING TOO FAST. AND CAMILLE IS TRYING TO CROSS THE STREET, AND SHE THINKS IT'S SAFE, AND IT USUALLY IS BUT THIS TIME, IT'S A KIDNAPPER, SO SHE GETS HIT BY THE CAR. WATCH OUT. AND THE KIDNAPPERS JUMP OU AND THEN BECAUSE THEY HIT HIM, THE POLICE COME AND THEY GET ARRESTED OR SOMETHING. SO THAT WAS BASICALLY OUR-- OUR STORY LINE. AMD THE SAIN WILL PLAY THE SHEIK AND THEY'LL PAY THE KIDNAPPERS, AND WE'RE GOOD. READY, BECKETT? YES. OKAY, HOLD HIM. WHEN I SAY "ACTION," LET HIM GO, OKAY? OKAY, GO. ACTION! RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN! COME ON, BECKETT! COME ON, BECKETT! BIG GROUP. FASTER, FASTER! OKAY. GIVE ME THE GUN. SO WE DO THE SAME THING AGAIN BUT WITH MANSOUR INSTEAD OF BECKETT. I FIRST. I FIRST. SO THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT HE PLAYS THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH. OKAY. IN THIS SCENE. THERE'S OTHER SCENES WHERE HE DOESN' PLAY THE SHEIK. HE PLAYS OTHER CHARACTERS. BUT IN THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH THING, HE GETS KIDNAPPED. YES. AND, I GUESS WE HAVE TO TIE HIM UP WITH SOME ROPE. YES. FIRST STANDING, AND THEN TO A CHAIR. AND THEN THESE RANSOMERS COME AND THAT GUY AND THAT GUY PLAY THE RANSOMERS. OKAY. AND HE'S GOING TO BE AT THE TABLE. AT THE BANQUET. AND THEN WE NEED A SCENE WHERE HE SIGNS A LAW CHANGING THE LABOR LAWS. HE SIGNS A MORE PROGRESSIVE LABOR LAW INTO EFFECT. WHAT KIND OF LABOR LAW DO YOU MEAN? OH, THE IDEA IS LIKE, YOU KNOW, INDIANS WHO COME TO WORK IN SHARJAH-- YES. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN' BECOME CITIZENS. RIGHT? SO THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT. YEAH, THEY GAVE US A PERMIT. - YEAH? - YEAH. AND THE SHEIK IS FUNDING THE BIENNIAL. OKAY. AND HIS DAUGHTER IS THE PRESIDEN OF THE BIENNIAL. OH, OKAY. YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE INVOLVING THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. YEAH, SO WE JUST WAN TO BE SURE THAT IF IT'S-- I WILL JUST ASK KAJISAN, OKAY? YEAH. THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH BASICALLY, I'M TOLD, OWNS SHARJAH LIKE IT'S HIS COUNTRY. AND HE'S LIKE--I DIDN' REALIZE THIS AT THE TIME, BUT HE'S LIKE THE SUPREME RULER. I MEAN, IT'S BASICALLY A DICTATORSHIP. YOU HAVE INVOLVED THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH. OKAY, SO THIS COUNTRY HAS ITS RULES. UH-HUH. AND WE RESPECT HIM, AND HE'S BEEN HERE FOR SO MANY YEARS, OKAY? SO THE OTHER THING IS WE NEED SOMEBODY MAYBE FROM POLICE OR SOMEBODY WHO CAN EXPLAIN HIM AND TELL HIM, OKAY, THERE'S NO PROBLEM IN DOING THIS. OKAY? YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S A LITTLE BIT--BECAUSE, SEE, IF IT'S A NORMAL MAN, IT'S OKAY, BUT IT'S THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH, YOU KNOW? AND WE HAVE VERY HIGH RESPEC FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. SO, UNLESS, AND UNTIL SOMEBODY, A LOCAL GUY OR SOMEONE, WHO'S A RESPONSIBLE PERSON, COMES AND EXPLAINS HIM THAT IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM, I DON'T THINK SO HE'LL BE DOING IT. OH. HI, YAZAN. HI, YAZAN. HEY. THIS IS... OKAY. SO WE WANT HIM TO PLAY THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH IN A SCENE. OKAY, THAT'S TOO MUCH. I DON'T THINK THIS IS LIKE-- DID YOU HAVE--CAN WE SPEAK? SURE. OKAY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. YEAH. OKAY. MAYBE YOU NEED TO CUT THIS, BECAUSE... AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK MICHAEL WASN'T SURE IF THIS MEAN TURN OFF THE CAMERA OR PRETEND TO TURN OFF THE CAMERA. BUT HE WAS SHOOTING. AND HE SORT OF TILTED UP. BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE TELL YOU LIKE, OH, YOU GOT TO STOP FILMING. THAT HAPPENED TO US A FEW TIMES. I'M ALWAYS LIKE, WELL, JUST KEEP FILMING. AND IF THEY REALLY STAR GETTING MENACING, OKAY, WE'LL TURN IT OFF, BUT IT'S GOOD TO GET THAT ON CAMERA. I REALLY DON'T WAN TO BE FILMED RIGHT NOW. RIGHT. NOT ME. NOT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. YES. I SEE. YES. YOU WERE? YEAH. I WANT POCKET MONEY, MUFFY. WHAT? POCKET MONEY. POCKET MONEY? POCKET MONEY MUFFY. YOU WANT US TO GIVE YOU POCKET MONEY? YES. NO. WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED BUDGET WHICH IS EVERYONE IS DOING EVERYTHING FOR FREE. YES, HE WANTS MONEY. FOR, FOR ANYTHING, FOR, WHAT'S HE DO? WELL, THAT WASN'T THE DEAL. OKAY. BUT WHAT-- HUH? WE'LL STOP FOR TONIGHT. BUT I'LL SAY WE QUIT. WHAT? WE WON'T, HE DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE. HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN THE MOVIE ANYMORE? NO. IS THAT WHAT HE SAID? NO, YEAH. OKAY. FINE. OKAY. SURE. OKAY. WE'RE HAVING A BAD NIGHT. OKAY. WHAT CAN WE DO? WE CAN BLUR EVERYONE'S FACES, BLEEP EVERYONE'S NAMES, YOU KNOW, LIKE REALLY? BE APPROPRIATE. THEY WON'T SHOW I AT THE BIENNIAL, YOU KNOW. IT'S THEIR FAULT. IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT. YES, I JUST DON' WANT PEOPLE TO GET IN TROUBLE AND SO I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THIS POSITION BEFORE. THE WORST THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN BEFORE WAS LIKE MY FILM DOESN'T GET SHOWN. NOW, I DON'T-- RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. SO I WAS LIKE OKAY, WELL MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT AND MAYBE THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST PARANOID. THEY ALL SEEMED--THEY ACTUALLY SEEMED PARANOID TO ME. LIKE EVERYBODY SEEMED PARANOID. BUT WHEN EVERYONE IS PARANOID, YOU START TO GE PARANOID THAT YOU'RE--YOU SHOULD BE PARANOID, YOU KNOW? RIGHT. SO THE NEXT DAY, WE ASKED HEMADI IF HIS FRIEND WHO HAD BEEN HANGING OUT WHEN WE SHO THE SCENE WITH CAMILLE GETTING HIT BY A CAR MIGHT BE WILLING TO PLAY THE SHEIK. SO WHAT'S YOUR FRIEND'S NAME AGAIN? ABDUL? YES, ABDUL RACHMAN. ABDULLAH? ABDUL RACHMAN. ABDULLAH... ABDUL RAHMAN. ABDUL RACHMAN. ABDUL RAHMAN. RAH ABDUL RAHMAN. YES. ABDUL RAHMAN. NO, NOT MUCH, YOU KNOW. CAN WE ASK YOUR FRIEND, ABDUL RAHMAN, IF HE WILL ACT IN OUR MOVIE? COULD WE DO THE SCENE WHERE HE GETS TIED UP? OR HE'S BEING KIDNAPPED? WHERE? HERE? NO. NEXT DOOR. NEXT DOOR. IS THAT OKAY? WELL, I WELL JUST IN CASE-- WHY DO WE HAVE A CABLE? OH, YES. HE HAS NO PROBLEM WITH IT. OH... OH, THE SCENE IS, WE SAID LAST NIGHT, YOU PLAYING THE KIDNAPPER. YES. THE SHEIKS ARE ALL HERE. AND THEN BECKETT COMES AND HE STOPS THE PLOT. IT'S FOR THAT SCENE. OH, YES. SO IT'S A SCENE WHERE WE SHOW THAT HE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED. KIDNAPPED. THAT IS THE-- YEAH, YEAH. THAT SHOT YOU ARE GOING TO TWO-SHOT. OH. WE GO TO YOUR ROOM, SO YOU COME IN, GUN AND A KNIFE AND YOU SAY, GIVE ME YOUR MONEY. NO, YOU DON'T DIE. YOU JUST SIT. AND THEN, THERE'S GOING TO BE A CALL TO PRAYER. OKAY? LIKE THE CALL TO PRAYER. ALLAH AKBAR! NO, NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, YOU DON' HAVE TO DO THAT. IT'S NOT GOOD? IS THIS... CAVEH. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT, SO IT'S GOT TO BE A LITTLE LOWER OKAY? OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. SO YOU WALK INTO FRAME, FROM OUT HERE. SO WE SEE YOUR SHADOWS COMING. IN YOUR HAND, YOU HOLD THE DAGGER, OKAY? YES. YOU COME LIKE THIS. OKAY? AND HEMADI NEXT TO HIM WITH THE GUN. OKAY? OKAY. READY? GET SET. ACTION! DON'T MOVE. FIRST OF ALL, A LITTLE FASTER. A LITTLE FASTER. ACTION! BOOM! OKAY, READY? YES. ACTION! OH, NO. JUST DO...[LAUGHS] ACTION! HEMADI, WHY ARE YOU STANDING ON TIPTOE LIKE THIS? OH, I DON'T KNOW. ACTION! OKAY, YOU KEEP DOING THIS THING. I CAN'T! IT'S THAT LEG. ACTION! OH, AGAIN. WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHERE DO YOU WANT IT? THE IDEA IS, YES, YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO KIDNAP THE SHEIK, RIGHT? AND SUDDENLY THE THEN THE CALL TO PRAYER, THE SIGN TO PRAY. YES. BECAUSE YOU'RE RELIGIOUS, YOU STOP, TO PRAY. I WANT TO SHOW THAT. TRUST US, IT'S GOOD. OKAY. BUT WHY WOULD HE REAC NEGATIVE TO THAT? OKAY. DOESN'T FUNCTION THAT WAY. YES, IT DOESN' FUNCTION THAT WAY. YEAH, YEAH, BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T STOP TO PRAY AT A CERTAIN TIME. THEY GO TO THE MOSQUE, RIGHT? WHENEVER... YEAH. NO, I KNOW. IT'S IMAGINARY. IT'S COMEDIC. IT'S NOT REAL. COMEDY. IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD. HE SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE YOU DO THAT BECAUSE IF THE PEOPLE THEY GO TO PRAY, THEY DO NOT CARRY GUNS AND THEY NEED TO CLEAN UP. THAT'S STUPID. I KNOW IT'S STUPID. IT IS STUPID. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE STUPID. THIS IS... WE CAN ALSO DO IT DIFFERENTLY. I KNOW IT'S NOT REALISTIC. I KNOW IT'S NOT REALISTIC. IT HAS NO MEANING THAT IS REALISTIC FOR THE PEOPLE. YES BUT IT'S JUST A FANTASY. BECAUSE IT'S, YES... IT'S JUST A FANTASY. NO, NO, BUT IT'S OUR FANTASY. IT IS, YES, YOUR FANTASY. OKAY. SO, WE CAN DO IT DIFFERENTLY. WE CAN DO IT DIFFERENTLY. HE'S OBJECTING THE PRAY WITH THE GUNS. OKAY. WHATEVER YOUR ATTEMPT OR MEANINGS, WHAT YOU MEAN YOU, IT DOES NOT MATTER, BUT FOR THEM THEY SEE THE GUNS AND THE PRAYER DOESN'T FUNCTION. OKAY, OKAY. SO, WE JUST COME IN WITH BECKETT. YEAH. AND WE'LL SEE YOU AND WE'LL GO LIKE THIS. OKAY? NOW YOU PUT DOWN THE GUNS, OKAY? WELL, YES, THAT CAN BE BETTER. OKAY. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO HIM? WE WILL PUT THIS OUT. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WE WILL PUT IT OUT. OKAY. HERE'S WHA WE'RE GOING TO DO. BECKETT IS GOING TO WALK IN. HE'S GOING TO TAKE THE GUN AWAY FROM YOU. AND THEN HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME THE GUN AND THEN I'M GOING TO HOLD IT ON YOU GUYS AND THAT'S THE END OF THE SCENE. DROP IT! OKAY. WE DID IT. YAY! SO, THE NEXT DAY ABDUL RAHMAN SAYS THAT HE WANTS HIS RELEASE FORM BACK AND HE DOESN'T WAN TO BE IN THE MOVIE ANYMORE. SO, LARA INSISTED THAT I SIGN A RELEASE FORM ANNULLING THE RELEASE FORM THAT ABDUL RAHMAN HAD SIGNED. LARA, LOOK. YOU DON'T RESPECT MY DECISION. NO, NO, I MEAN THIS IS... YOU'RE MAKING ME-- AND NEGOTIATED. THIS IS NOT, THIS IS-- BUT IF I... DON'T. AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE LAST THING WE SHOT. WE JUST HAD TO-- WE HAD TO LEAVE. YOU KNOW, WE HAD A FLIGHT TO CATCH. SO, WE CAME BACK TO THE STATES AND OUR LAST IDEA WAS TO LIKE PU ON LIKE THE ARAB HEADDRESS AND STUFF AT THE AIRPOR AND WALK THROUGH CUSTOMS AND WE THOUGH FOR SURE THEY WOULD STOP US BECAUSE THEY WOULD LIKE I THOUGHT THEY'D BE LIKE RACIST AND PREJUDICED AND THEY WOULD LIKE THINK, "HEY, WE'RE GOING TO LIKE SEARCH THESE GUYS. THESE GUYS LOOK ARAB." AND NO ONE STOPPED US, AND I WAS LIKE REALLY SURPRISED AND IMPRESSED BY OUR CUSTOMS PEOPLE. AND ALL THE TAXI GUYS WERE LIKE TALKING TO US IN ARABIC. OKAY. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? UM, WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE PROBLEM? WELL, I THINK MAYBE THE STUFF ABOUT THE SHEIKH OF SHARJAH? YEAH. RIGHT? THAT'S THE MAIN PROBLEM, RIGHT? I MEAN, LET'S JUS START WITH THE KIND OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL THING, WHICH IS YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT, AND IT JUST CAN'T BE DONE. AND IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE THIS THING WHERE IT'S LIKE OH IF YOU DO THAT, YOU KNOW LIKE, SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET KILLED OR LIKE MANSOUR IS GOING TO PUT IN JAIL OR TORTURED. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. LIKE IT'S REALLY ON A IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS LIKE MANSOUR JUST LOSING HIS JOB AND BEING SENT BACK HOME OR YAZAN LOSING HIS JOB. RIGHT. WHICH WE DON'T WANT. OR LIKE THE MOMEN WHERE LIKE YAZAN SAYS LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG PROBLEM ESPECIALLY FOR MANSOUR BECAUSE OF RACISM LIKE JUST OVER KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW, COMMENTS ABOUT A SYSTEMATIC, YOU KNOW, FUCKED-UP-NESS OF THE PLACE. UH-HUH. BUT IF YOU SAID THAT IN THE UNITED STATES EVERYBODY WOULD GO, "YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF RACISM HERE." IT WOULDN'T BE A STATEMENT ABOU THE GOVERNMENT OR ANYTHING. IT'S JUST LIKE A STATEMENT ABOU PEOPLE'S, YOU KNOW, DEEP-SEEDED, LONG-STANDING PREJUDICES. I MEAN, A, IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS VERY MUCH GOVERNMENTAL POLICY THAT MAKES FOR THESE FUCKED UP LAWS. ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC SHOTS THAT I COULD CU OUT THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM OR IS IT LIKE BIGGER THAN THAT? I WOULD SAY THE MOS SORT OF PROBLEMATIC PART IS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT GUY THAT YOU'RE SORT OF TRYING TO HIRE TO PLAY THE PAR OF THE SHEIK AND HE'S GOING TO, YOU KNOW... THE LABOR LAWS THING. YEAH, HE'S GOING TO CHANGE THE LABOR LAWS AND MAKE I MORE PROGRESSIVE. I MEAN THERE'S INACCURACIES IN THAT BUT... I MEAN I WAS CRINGING INITIALLY WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PRAYER STUFF TOO. REALLY? WHY THE PRAYER? I'M SURPRISED BY THAT ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M JUST GOING TO LAY THE MINUTE OR TWO OF THE PRAYER SEQUENCE JUST THAT I CAN KIND OF PINPOINT MORE SPECIFICALLY. IS THAT OKAY? SURE. [ISLAMIC PRAYER ON LAPTOP] RIGHT. SO, THIS MOMENT IS... I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, I REALLY WANTED TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS SO I TRIED BLEEPING THE RACISM LINE. OH. AND ALSO THE LABOR LAWS. YOU KNOW... [BLEEP] YOU COME TO WORK IN SHARJAH? YEAH. YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T [BLEEP]. YEAH. RIGHT? AND I THINK THE ENDING WAS REALLY COOL THE WAY IT ENDED. [ISLAMIC PRAYER PLAYING] BUT ANYWAY RASHA FINALLY SAW THE FILM. SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL. IT'S JUST THINKING NO THAT I DON'T LIKE IT. IT'S JUST THAT I ALSO HAVE A SENSE THAT THERE'S A BETTER FILM BEHIND IT. AND I FELT BAD, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED HER AND I REALLY WANTED HER TO LIKE ME. I WAS REALLY I WAS REALLY BUMMED ABOUT IT LIKE I WAS DEPRESSED. AND I WAS LIKE, DID I MAKE A BAD MOVIE AND I JUS DON'T REALIZE IT? LIKE, IS SHE RIGHT? AND LIKE I SEEM LIKE I WAS LIKE THIS SPOILED AMERICAN COMING IN WITH MY PRECONCEIVED IDEAS AND TELLING THEM HOW THEY SHOULD BE, AND IT WAS LIKE REALLY IMPERIALISTIC. I WAS LIKE, I KNOW. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT. LIKE IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS YOU KNOW, MAKING FUN OF IMPERIALISM OR SORT OF A CRITIQUE OF IMPERIALISM LIKE IN THIS FUNNY SELF CONSCIOUS SELF REFLEXIVE WAY. I WAS KIND OF EXCITED HONESTLY TO MAKE A FILM THAT WOULD SOR OF HELP CHANGE STEREOTYPES. LIKE I REALLY WANT TO MAKE A FILM THAT WOULD MAKE PEOPLE THINK THAT ARABS WERE COOL. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE WERE COOL. LIKE YAZAN WAS COOL AND CAMILLE WAS COOL AND RASHA WAS COOL. LIKE THEY WERE ALL COOL. COOLER THAN MOST PEOPLE. LIKE THEY WERE VERY COOL. AND I FEEL LIKE IT WAS ENOUGH JUS TO HAVE THEM IN THE MOVIE. LIKE JUST HAVING THEM IN THE MOVIE WAS ALREADY LIKE A HUGE IMPROVEMEN ON THE USUAL STEREOTYPES. LIKE IT WOULD HELP CREATE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. LIKE IT WOULD PUSH THINGS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, TOWARDS GREATER UNDERSTANDING. I REALLY THOUGHT THA AND I WANTED THAT, BUT I WAS STILL WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE FILM GETTING IN TROUBLE. I MEAN THE PROBLEM IS LIKE EVEN IF WE SHOW IN THE STATES, THEY COULD GET IN TROUBLE, RIGHT? WE COULD. THEY COULD. I DON'T CARE ABOUT US. WE CAN'T GET IN TROUBLE. NO, I KNOW. WELL WHO WILL GET IN TROUBLE? YAZAN, CAMILLE, RASHA. IN THE STATES? LARA. EVERY... NO, THEY'D GET IN TROUBLE HERE, LIKE IF THE MOVIE IS SHOWN PUBLICLY. SO, I WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE IMPASSE, AND I COULDN'T REALLY FIND IT. AND ONE DAY I SPOKE TO MY FRIEND, ALAN BERLINER, WHO'S A FILMMAKER, AND HE SAID, I SAID, "WELL, I DON' KNOW WHO THAT IS. I MEAN THAT COULD BE THE SHEIK I GUESS." AND HE'S LIKE, SO, I THOUGHT, "WHOA! THAT'S A GREAT IDEA." I KNEW THAT THE SHEIK WAS GOING TO BE AT THE BIENNIAL, AND I ASSUMED HE'S GOING TO WATCH THE MOVIE. SO, THIS WAS A WAY TO GE TO HIM LIKE I'M GOING TO SAY, "LOOK, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. CAN YOU HELP US?" "DEAR HIS HIGHNESS SHEIKH DOCTOR SULTAN BIN MOHAMED AL-QASIMI, MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND RULER OF SHARJAH." LIKE MAYBE HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WE NEEDED HIS HELP. YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. I'VE HEARD THAT YOUR HIGHNESS IS A MAN OF CULTURE AND LEARNING AND THAT YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF MANY BOOKS AND PLAYS. I'M THEREFORE ASKING YOUR HIGHNESS TO GRAN ME PERMISSION TO UNCENSOR WHAT YAZAN SAYS IN THE CAR, TO ALLOW TWO POLICE OFFICERS IN A POLICE VAN TO PRETEND TO ARREST US IN FRON OF THE SHEIK'S HOUSE, TO ALLOW THE SAME TWO POLICE OFFICERS TO PRETEND TO ROUGH UP MANSOUR, TO ALLOW ME TO LEAVE IN THE REFERENCES TO THE LABOR LAWS, AND TO ALLOW ME TO LEAVE IN THE CHOREOGRAPHY SHO THAT THE SHARJAH ART FOUNDATION ASKED ME TO REMOVE. FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOUR HIGHNESS'S PERMISSION TO ALLOW...TO PLAY YOUR HIGHNESS IN OUR MOVIE OR EVEN BETTER TO PLAY THE ROLE YOURSELF. SINCE THE BIENNIAL IS ABOUT AR AS A SUBVERSIVE ACT, IT JUS SEEMED LIKE THE PERFECT MOVIE IDEA. LIKE I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THIS IDEA. I THOUGHT THIS WAS LIKE GREAT. UM... I MEAN FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT THEY WERE-- IT WAS PROBLEMATIC FROM THE GET-GO, RIGHT? LIKE, PUTTING EMPLOYEES IN A DIFFICULT POSITION, ADDRESSING SENSITIVE ISSUES THAT WE KNOW ARE SENSITIVE AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BUT ARE DONE SO IN A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY, WHICH IS JUST NOT HOW IT WORKS HERE. I JUST, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE CURATORS. THEY'RE ART CURATORS. I WAS LIKE, COME ON, YOU ASK ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY WORK. YOU KNOW THE KIND OF STUFF I DO. THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF I DO. I MEAN I CAN SENSE YOU'RE FRUSTRATED AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE FRUSTRATED, BUT JUS TO SORT OF CONTEXTUALIZE THINGS, YOU KNOW, DICTATORS ARE FALLING LEFT, RIGHT AND CENTER. IT'S A CRAZY TIME IN THE REGION. I FORGOT SOMETHING. I FORGOT THE ARAB UPRISING. LIKE AS SOON AS WE LEF SHARJAH THE WHOLE ARAB UPRISING HAPPENED. IF WE DEFINE PRODUCTIVE AS BEING LIKE ACTUALLY ADVANCING THE CAUSE OR HAVING SOMEBODY SEE SOMETHING IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT, YOU KNOW, LIKE THE TAKE ON THE LABOR LAW THING IS NO PARTICULARLY LAYERED OR COMPLEX AND YOU SAYING SO YOURSELF BECAUSE THERE'S FACTORS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW, RIGHT? LIKE THERE'S ACTUALLY COMPLEX, I HAVE ZERO INVESTMEN IN THE LABOR LAW ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS. YOU KNOW, I'M IGNORANT. RIGHT. BUT MY BUSINESS IS JUS I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THE LABOR LAW SEEMS FUCKED. WHETHER IT'S FUCKED OR NOT, WHETHER I'M RIGHT OR WRONG, I FEEL I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY THAT AS AN ARTIST LIKE, "HEY, MANSOUR'S KID LIVES IN PAKISTAN." HE'S 13. HE CAN'T LIVE WITH HIS FATHER. THAT'S FUCKED. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S FAULT THAT IS. MAYBE IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT. IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE. AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO BE RIGH ABOUT THAT EVEN TO BE ABLE TO SAY IT. I THINK HEIN ACTUALLY WAS KIND OF PERSUADED BY WHAT I SAID LIKE I THINK HE RECOGNIZED THE VALIDITY AND THE ABSURDITY OF WHAT HE WAS DOING. I THINK HE WASN'T ENJOYING THE CONSTRAINTS EITHER. AT ONE POINT I SAID, YOU KNOW, "WOULD IT ALL BE SOLVED BY THE SHEIK SAYING IT'S FINE?" IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SHEIK. OH IT'S NOT? NO. WHAT'S IT ABOUT? I MEAN IT'S ABOUT THEM GETTING IN TROUBLE, RIGHT? AND SO I SAID, "LOOK, YOU DON' KNOW THE SHEIK WON'T LIKE IT. MAYBE THE SHEIK WOULD LIKE IT." LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHY NOT SHOW IT TO HIM? I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO-- WE'RE PLANNING TO SHOW IT TO JACK. WE'RE GOING TO SHOW IT TO JACK, I'M GOING TO ASK HIM IF CAN ACTUALLY SHOW IT TO SHEIKHA, THE SHEIK'S DAUGHTER. JACK PERSEKIAN WAS THE HEAD OF THE SHARJAH ART FOUNDATION AND I REALLY JUST CROSSED PATHS WITH HIM LIKE ONCE. BUT SO ANYWAY HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE ROYAL FAMILY THEY SAID. HE WAS THE DIRECTOR-- THE DAUGHTER OF THE SHEIK WAS THE PRESIDENT. AND IT WAS HER IDEA. THE BIENNIAL WAS HER IDEA BECAUSE SHE WENT TO ART SCHOOL IN LONDON AND SHE WANTED TO HAVE AN ART FESTIVAL, AND SHE'S LOADED AND HER FATHER SAID, "OKAY, I'LL PAY FOR IT." SHE'S THE ONE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE FINAL CALL. JACK WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO MAKE A FINAL CALL. HE MIGHT SAY THERE'S NO WAY I'M SHOWING THIS TO SHEIKHA, SO WE'LL HAVE TO GO TO HIM FIRST. UH-HUH, I SEE. AND THEN TO SAY IF... SO IT'S A PROTOCOL THING? OKAY, WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD THING TO DO, DOESN'T IT? SURE. I MEAN YEAH. HI, CAN YOU HEAR US? YES, I CAN. CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? I CAN, I CAN'T SEE YOU, BUT I CAN HEAR YOU. THERE I SEE YOU NOW. OKAY? HI, BECKETT. CAN YOU SAY HI? NO? OKAY. UMM, HOW'S IT GOING? OKAY. WHAT, SO WHAT'S GOING ON? UM, SO, WE, UM... I LET JACK WATCH THE MOVIE, AND HE WAS WATCHING IT A HIS DESK AND HE WAS, YOU KNOW, HAVING A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT IT, AND THEN ALL SEEMED WELL AND SHEIKHA WAS AROUND AND SHE WAS WATCHING IT AND SHE WAS LAUGHING AS WELL. I WAS LIKE, "GREAT! "I KNEW IT. THEY LOVE IT. THEY LOVE THE MOVIE." AND THIS MORNING I SPOKE TO HIM, AND BASICALLY HIS ISSUES WERE MORE TO DO WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THINGS. UH-HUH. AND HE WAS KIND OF FREAKING OUT ABOUT I ACTUALLY. SO, I WAS WORRIED, YOU KNOW. SO I WAS LIKE ANXIOUS LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON? HE JUST WANTS TO BE SAFE. HE DOESN'T WANT LIKE A DENMARK SITUATION OCCURRING. SO, HE'S BASICALLY SENT THE FILM TO HIS OR THE FOUNDATION'S LAWYERS. OKAY. SO, I GOT AN EMAIL TODAY FROM JACK PERSEKIAN, AND HE BASICALLY SAID NOT ONLY ARE THEY NO GOING TO SHOW THE FILM, BUT THEY ARE SENDING A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER, AND THEY'RE FORBIDDING ME TO SHOW IT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. IT'S TAKEN TO-- REMOVE IT FROM EVERY WEBSITE. DESTROY EVERY COPY. AND HE SAYS THAT HIS LAWYERS HAVE SAID THAT IT COULD BE GROUNDS FOR IMPRISONMENT. THEN HE LIKE APPENDED HIS LAWYER'S LETTER TO HIM. HIS LAWYER SAID... "THE FILM PRESENTS UNACCEPTABLE RISKS OF BEING "DEEMED ILLEGAL UNDER U.A.E. LAWS PROHIBITING BLASPHEMY." AND IF IT WAS BLASPHEMOUS, WHICH HE DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE, BUT THEY COULD WIN THAT ARGUMENT, THE COURT COULD RULE THAT IT WAS BLASPHEMOUS, THEN HE, JACK PERSEKIAN, WOULD PROBABLY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND HAVE A LARGE FINE. GO TO PRISON FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AND UPON HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON HE'D BE DEPORTED. BUT SO ANYWAY, WE COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER TO GO OR NOT AND PAR OF ME WAS LIKE WE SHOULD GO BECAUSE LIKE IT'D BE REALLY DRAMATIC LIKE THEY'LL TRY TO STOP US. WE'LL TRY TO GET TO THE SHEIK. WE'LL TRY TO GIVE HIM A COPY OF THE FILM AND IT'LL BE GREAT FOOTAGE. AND WHAT'S THE WORS THING TO HAPPEN? THEY PUT US IN JAIL? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT'D BE THAT BAD. BUT MANDY, MY WIFE, WAS VERY, VERY WORRIED AND SHE SAID, "I'M NOT GOING. "I'M NOT GOING. I'M TAKING MY SON." LIKE, "IF YOU WANT TO GO, YOU GO, BUT I'M NOT GOING." AND THE MORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT SHARJAH AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, THE MORE I REALIZED LIKE PEOPLE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHTS THERE. LIKE THERE WERE THESE VIDEO TAPES ONLINE OF THE SHEIKH OF ABU DHABI'S BROTHER BASICALLY TORTURING THIS GUY AND FILMING IT. AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. LIKE HE LIKE BEATS THIS GUY WITH A STICK THAT HAS NAILS IN IT AND THEN HE LIKE POURS SALT IN THE WOUNDS, AND THEN HE LIKE-- HORRIBLE THINGS. I CAN'T EVEN SAY THE THINGS HE DOES. BUT THEN ONE THING HE DOES IS HE RUNS HIM OVER WITH A CAR REPEATEDLY. TO DATE, THERE HAS BEEN NO POLICE ACTION TAKEN AGAINST SHEIKH ISSA, WHOSE BROTHER, THE CHIEF OF POLICE, OPENED, AND THEN CLOSED, AN OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION. BUT ONLINE IN WIKIPEDIA I READ THAT THEY DID HAVE A TRIAL FINALLY AND THE VERDIC WAS THAT HE WAS INNOCEN AND THAT THE GUY WHO HAD RELEASED THE VIDEO TAPES WAS GUILTY AND WAS SENTENCED IN ABSENTIA FOR FIVE YEARS. SO, THIS WAS KIND OF SCARY. [MANDY] CAN I BE PART OF THAT POSITION? IT'S JUST... THEY CAN SAY I SAW THE MOVIE. IT'S BLASPHEMOUS. MY LAWYERS LOOKED AT IT. HIS CONTEXT OF BLASPHEMY IS LIKE NOT FAMILIAR CHOICE AT ALL AND YE IT'S LIKE ALIVE AND WELL IN THOSE COUNTRIES, YOU KNOW. [WOMAN] TO ME IT JUS SEEMS LIKE THEY WOULD IF THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID A NEGATIVE PRESS THE LAST THING THEY WOULD DO WOULD BE TO ARREST YOU, UPON ARRIVAL. NO. I WOULDN'T INVOLVE SOMEONE IN THE STORY BEFORE YOU LEF AND THEN IF THA WERE TO OCCUR I MEAN... I JUST MEAN LIKE-- I WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH A JOURNALIST. YEAH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YEAH. LIKE FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES. OR LIKE OBAMA WOULD HAVE TO COME WITH ME. AND HOLD MY HAND. EXACTLY. THEY COULD REALLY DO A FATWA. ALL YOU NEED IS SOME PERSON WHO SAYS THAT IT'S BLASPHEMOUS AND IT COULD LIKE CREATE A STIR. PEOPLE COULD LIKE GET ALL RILED UP AND THEY COULD LIKE COME AFTER ME, RIGHT? FROM HERE? FROM HERE, YEAH. WELL LIKE THE GUY WHO KILLED THEO VAN GOGH IN HOLLAND. IT WAS IN HOLLAND. HE WAS ON HIS BICYCLE IN HIS HOMETOWN OF HOLLAND. THIS GUY CAME UP TO HIM WITH A GUN ON THE STREET AND SHOT HIM. AND IT'S BECAUSE HE MADE A FILM WHERE HE PROJECTED VERSES FROM THE KORAN ON A WOMAN'S BODY, BUT JUS THE FACT THAT HE MADE THIS FILM THAT HAD SOME COMPLICATED THING TO SAY ABOUT ISLAM AND WOMEN, SOME GUY KILLED HIM. I MEAN IF THEY'RE THAT ANGRY ABOUT IT FROM OVER THERE. RIGHT, THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WAN TO TALK ABOUT IT IN FRON OF MANDY BECAUSE, SHE'S-- WOULD GET HYSTERICAL. SHE'S VERY AFRAID. SHE'S ALREADY AFRAID. SO, THAT'S ONE REASON NOT TO GO, BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT WE COULD BE KILLED HERE. LIKE THEY'RE BASICALLY A TRIBAL SOCIETY THAT'S JUST TRYING TO SUDDENLY BE MODERN, AND THEY STILL HAVE ONE FOO IN TRIBAL REVENGE MODE AND ANOTHER FOO IN SOME KIND OF INTERNATIONAL ARTS FESTIVAL MODE. AND LIKE I WAS TALKING TO ALAN BERLINER ABOUT IT TODAY, AND HE WAS JUST SAYING... "YOU FOUND JUS THE RIGHT BUTTON TO PRESS. "IT'S EXACTLY THE THING THAT WOULD LIKE PISS THEM OFF. "THAT WOULD RILE THEM UP. "THAT WOULD LIKE CREATE CONTROVERSY. "BUT IT'S TRUE YOU COULD DIE. AND ON SOME LEVEL YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DIE FOR YOUR ART." YEAH I MEAN THESE GUYS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR RELIGION CLEARLY. I MEAN I'M SERIOUS TOO ABOUT MINE, WHICH IS CINEMA. BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE THERE'S A WAR, A RELIGIOUS WAR BETWEEN LIKE DIFFEREN IDEAS OF GOD REALLY. AND THIS IS LIKE A DIFFERENT IDEA OF GOD. AND LIKE THEY'RE LIKE, "WE WILL KILL YOU." I MEAN THERE IS THIS IDEA IN THE QURAN THAT GOD IS EVERYWHERE, WHEREVER YOU TURN YOUR FACE, YOU'LL FIND THE FACE OF GOD. SO, THERE IS THIS IDEA, BUT NOT AS A TREE OR AS A STONE OR AS SOMETHING CREATION, BECAUSE CREATION IS CREATED. HE IS UNCREATED SO HE CANNO BE PART OF CREATION, BUT HE IS TRANSCENDENTLY PRESENT OR TRANSCENDENTLY EVERYWHERE. BUT SO ANYWAY, CAMILLE, TOLD ME ONCE THAT HE WAS A BIG FAN OF THE FILM WAKING LIFE, WHICH I WAS IN, AND THA THAT FILM HAD MEANT A LO TO HIM AND THA HE ESPECIALLY LOVED MY SCENE. AND SO WHAT FILM IS ACTUALLY CAPTURING IS LIKE GOD, INCARNATE, CREATING YOU KNOW, AND LIKE THIS VERY MOMENT, LIKE YOU KNOW, UM, GOD IS MANIFESTING AS THIS AND WHAT THE FILM WOULD CAPTURE IF IT WAS FILMING US RIGHT NOW WOULD BE LIKE GOD AS THIS TABLE AND GOD AS YOU AND GOD AS ME, AND GOD LOOKING THE WAY WE LOOK RIGHT NOW AND SAYING AND THINKING WHAT WE'RE THINKING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT IS--WE ALL GOD MANIFEST IN THAT SENSE. AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE FILM MEANT A LOT TO HIM AND ALSO THAT IT HAD MEANT A LOT TO HAIG, WHO HAD BEEN HIS ROOMMATE IN COLLEGE, AND THA THEY'D ACTUALLY WATCHED THE FILM TOGETHER AND HAD BEEN REALLY MOVED BY IT, AND INSPIRED TO TRY TO MAKE MOVIES, SO FILM IS ACTUALLY LIKE A RECORD OF GOD OR A FACE OF GOD OR OF THE EVER-CHANGING FACE OF GOD. YOU HAVE A MOSQUITO, DO YOU WAN ME TO GET IT FOR YOU? GOT IT. I GOT IT? YEAH YOU GOT IT. TALKING ABOUT IMAGES? YES. I MEAN IMAGES IF THEY WERE NO POWERFUL AND COULD BE MISTAKEN FOR GOD OR FOR SUBSTITUTE OF GOD OR FOR MEDIUM TO GOD THEN THERE WOULD NOT BE THIS CENSORSHIP ON CREATING IMAGES. BUT ANYWAY I KEEP CALLING RASHA AND HAIG. THEY WEREN'T ANSWERING. AND I EMAILED, AND THEY WOULDN'T ANSWER, AND THEN FINALLY THEY SAID, "WE CAN TALK NOW." IT'S NICE TO HEAR FROM YOU. [SASHA] YEAH. HOW ARE YOU? DEPRESSED. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. ANYTHING YOU GUYS CAN TELL ME? THE STORY... I'M SORRY. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME I'M GOING TO CUT OFF THE VIDEO, BECAUSE THE CONNECTION IS NOT GOOD, OKAY? CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME? YEAH. BASED ON HOW THINGS ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT HERE IS THAT THE KIND OF THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE FILM OR THE SPIRIT OF THE FILM IS PROBLEMATIC. AND THEY WERE DEFENDING JACK PERSEKIAN'S BAN ON THE MOVIE AND HIS THREAT OF LEGAL ACTION. ALL THAT STUFF, THEY WERE DEFENDING IT. AND I WAS LIKE, "HOW CAN YOU DO THIS? "YOU GUYS ARE CURATORS. LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT WHETHER THE BIENNIAL SHOWS IT OR NOT THAT MUCH, BUT I DO CARE ABOUT MY FREEDOM TO EXPRESS MYSELF, AND JACK IS TRYING TO STOP THAT. CAVEH, LIKE, THERE'S LIMITS TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN THE STATES AS WELL. LIKE YOU WOULDN' BE ABLE TO KIND OF LIGHT-HEARTEDLY, YOU KNOW, PLAY WITH THE THINGS LIKE THE HOLOCAUS OR CHILD ABUSE OR... YES, YOU ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO DO THAT. QUITE A FEW PEOPLE FEEL THAT YOUR REPRESENTATION IS RACIST, THEN, THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE. THERE IS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OF COURSE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY REPUTATION IS RACIST? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT'S THE REPRESENTATION OF ISLAM AND MUSLIM RITUALS. IS RACIST? YES. HOLD ON A SECOND. FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE ANY FILM I WANT ABOU THE SITUATION. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK I DON'T, BUT I DO. NO ONE CAN STOP ME DOING THAT UNLESS YOU KILL ME. OKAY? [GUN FIRES] UM...[CLEARS THROAT] IT'S NOT BULLSHIT. YOU KNOW WHAT? BLASPHEMY HERE IS BEYOND SERIOUS, OKAY?" AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WELL WHAT IF SOMEBODY DECIDES "TO BOMB THE CINEMA WHERE THE FILM IS PLAYING "BECAUSE THEY'RE SO ANGRY AND INDIGNANT OF YOUR FILM THAT THEY BLOW UP THE CINEMA AND ALL THESE PEOPLE DIE?" WHAT IF THAT HAPPENED? THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT WOULD IT? WE STILL SAY WE SHOULD SHOW IT? I WAS LIKE, "NO. "OF COURSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GET KILLED, BUT YOU REALLY THINK SOMEBODY WOULD BOMB THE CINEMA BECAUSE LITTLE KIDS ARE DANCING IN IT?" THAT'S WHA BLASPHEMY IMPLIES. IT DOESN'T IMPLY PRISON. IT DOESN'T IMPLY BEING EXPELLED FROM THE COUNTRY. IT IMPLIES THE LEGITIMIZED ACTION OF VIOLENCE. DO YOU REMEMBER THE DANISH CARTOONS? THAT WASN'T A JOKE. I MEAN EMBASSIES WERE PUT ON FIRE. PEOPLE AMASS IN THE STREETS. IT WAS OUR LAST CONVERSATION. ACTUALLY WE NEVER SPOKE AGAIN. [COMPUTER BLEEPING OFF] SO I GOT A LAWYER. HE READ THE EMAIL FROM JACK PERSEKIAN AND FROM THEIR LAWYER AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLY OUTRAGEOUS." THEY'VE THREATENED A U.S. JOURNALIST AND DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER AND NOW IN ONE OF THE FIRST NEW CASES BROUGHT UNDER NEW YORK'S LIBEL TERRORISM LAW, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE EXPLAIN THEMSELVES. UH-HUH. THEY'RE IN A LOT MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY KNOW, WHICH IS WHY I'VE THREATENED THEM BACK. NICELY. SO, ANYWAY IT BECAME THIS LEGAL BATTLE. AND THE BIENNIAL WAS STARTING LIKE THAT DAY. AND I WAS LIKE WE GO TO GO TO THE PRESS. WE GOT TO TELL PEOPLE THAT THESE GUYS AT THE BIENNIAL, LIKE THEY'RE CENSORING WORK. LIKE THEY CLAIM TO BE NOT DOING IT AND ACTUALLY THE NEW YORK TIMES CARRIED AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE SHARJAH BIENNIAL LIKE THE WEEK BEFORE AND JACK PERSEKIAN WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, "THERE HAS BEEN NEVER THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY PRESSURE TO CONFORM TO A PREFERRED PERSPECTIVE OR TOW A PROPAGANDA LINE." HE SAID THAT IN PRIN IN NEW YORK TIMES A WEEK BEFORE HE BANNED MY MOVIE. SO, I WENT TO THE PRESS AND THE NEW YORK TIMES WROTE AN ARTICLE AND THE SHARJAH FOUNDATION WAS FURIOUS. AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER, AN ARTICLE COMES OU IN THE LOCAL U.A.E NEWSPAPER AND JACK PERSEKIAN WAS QUOTED AS SAYING... "THERE WERE PARTS THAT WERE EXPLOITATIVE OF SOME INDIAN MINORS WHO HANG AROUND THE MUSEUM." BY ACCUSING YOU OF CHILD EXPLOITATION, THEY'VE COMMITTED AN ACTIONABLE DEFAMATION IN THE UNITED STATES. AND I COULD GE JURISDICTION OVER THEM. OH, ONE OTHER THING HAPPENED THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION. JACK PERSEKIAN WAS FIRED BY THE SHEIK. AT FIRST I THOUGHT, "OH HE WAS FIRED BECAUSE HE BANNED MY FILM," YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT'S WHY HE WAS FIRED, BUT NO. HE WAS FIRED BECAUSE HE FAILED TO BAN ANOTHER WORK OF ART WHICH WAS ALSO ACCUSED OF BLASPHEMY AND INSTEAD OF DEFENDING THE PIECE AND SAYING IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT THEY'RE BANNING WORK, HE SAID... "IT WAS FOOLISH OF ME. I DIDN'T READ ALL THE FINE PRINT IN IT ON SOME OF THE CONTENT I MUS WAS OBJECTIONABLE. SO, NOW RASHA AND HAIG, WHO HAD DEFENDED JACK PERSEKIAN BANNING MY FILM, THEY PROTES JACK PERSEKIAN'S FIRING, AND THEY HAVE A MISSION STATEMENT SAYING, "THE MISSION OF ART IS TO DEFEND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION," AND THEY START A PETITION TO BOYCOTT THE SHARJAH BIENNIAL, THE SHARJAH ART FOUNDATION AND ALL ART INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. THE PETITION LIKE STARTS GETTING THOUSANDS OF SIGNATURES FROM LIKE ALL THESE ARTISTS AND STUFF, AND NO ONE EVER MENTIONED MY FILM, LIKE THEY NEVER SAID, "WE REGRET THEY INCLUDED MY FILM IN THE BAN." THEY JUST LIKE... I MEAN PART OF ME WAS THRILLED THAT THEY WERE LIKE BOYCOTTING THE BIENNIAL, BUT PART OF ME WAS LIKE, "WHAT HYPOCRITES." IT'S LIKE COME ON. YOU GUYS WERE A PART OF THIS. WHY DIDN'T YOU AT LEAS ADMIT THAT?" I'D LIKE TO TRY TO GET A SETTLEMEN BASED ON SHOWING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR MISCONDUC WITHOUT BLOWING UP THE REAL OBJECTIVES, WHICH ARE FOR YOU TO MAKE YOUR FILM, AND FOR YOU TO USE ALL OF WHAT'S HAPPENED. IT MAY BE THAT THEY THINK WE'RE BLUFFING. UH-HUH. AND I DON'T KNOW YOU VERY WELL AND PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW ME VERY WELL, BUT I DON'T BLUFF. UH-HUH, I DON' SENSE THAT YOU DO. BUT SO ANYWAY HE THREATENED TO SEIZE THEIR ASSETS BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID WAS ILLEGAL AND IT WAS IN THEIR INTEREST TO SETTLE. SO, UM, THEN THE LAWYER PERSUADED THE SHARJAH ART FOUNDATION FINALLY TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT SAYING NOT ONLY DID I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SHOW THE FILM WHEREVER I WANTED, EXCEPT THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES WHERE THEY WOULDN'T SHOW IT, BUT PART OF THE DEAL WAS THAT NOBODY WOULD GE IN TROUBLE BASICALLY, LIKE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS AND I DON' WANT PEOPLE GETTING ARRESTED. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE. THE MUTUAL GENERAL RELEASE THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO SHOW THE FILM AND NO SUBJECT PEOPLE WHO APPEARED IN THE FILM TO LIABILITY. THAT WAS GREAT, COLIN. GOOD JOB ON THE MOVING BLOODSTREAM. OKAY, WE GOT IT. COOL. YEAH. WE'RE DONE, CAMILLE. I'M ALMOST FINISHED. RIGHT HERE. WE'RE SHOOTING A MOVIE. OH MY TOUGH GUY. ARE YOU OKAY? [MUMBLES] YOU WOKE UP? YEAH. YEAH. YOU WOKE UP. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY IN YOUR BED. SHOULD WE GO LOOK FOR IT? YEAH? OKAY. SHOULD WE SAY GOOD NIGHT? SHOULD WE SAY GOODBYE TO THE CAMERA? SEE THE CAMERA OVER HERE? SEE THE CAMERA? SEE THE CAMERA RIGHT THERE? IT'S FILMING. HERE WE GO. READY? HERE WE GO. DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM? CRANKY? OKAY. BUT THAT'S THE STORY. OOPS. I ALMOST DROPPED THIS.
