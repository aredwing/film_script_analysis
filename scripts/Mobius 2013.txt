I had a dream similar to the one last week. I found myself in some... around the room. One form of the rotunda. There was rather dusty. It looked like a furnished pigeonholes. As a living, or maybe even a boudoir. A boudoir... They tried to recruit me. Instructions? Well, out with the language. YORKTOWN, VIRGINIA USA I do not know if we can operate with the event in our industry. No, we can not. There is no case. There are only rvrendere. I do not soon.

And FSB is shown also captivated by her. - What was the original mission? - Becoming Rostovskijs right hand. - And report on his activities. - In exchange for what? We make sure that she can be allowed to to come back and work in peace. She will say yes. But do not tell it can be the Russians. Let her believe it's French or monegaskerne or something. She is totally green. So the less she knows, the better for her. The dialed number is not... - Was it you who called? - I thought it was a wrong number. - No, it was true enough. - What should I do? Traders' conversations stored on a server, right? - Yes. - Copy all files. - How? I do not know the password. - You'll think of something. - It was time. - Yes. We have wasted much time. I want to see quick results. - You have one month. - Very well. Rostovskij recommended me to the President as head of the FSB. Because I'm loyal to Rostovskij. And now you want to compromise him? He creates kings. He can also throw them off the throne. Businessmen with that kind of power is bad. - So you want to... - I will crush him. - He does not have time now. - Two minutes. Can I talk to you for a moment? Ivan, Alice Redmond Head Department of derivative assets. Ivan Rostovskij. - Hello. - A pleasure to meet you. - You predicted Spain's crash, right? - I invented the program, which did. I'm hungry. Are you hungry? - Why do not we have lunch? - I would like. - Our friend is leaving the bank. - Alone? - No. Along with Diamond. - Keep your distance. "Keep your distance"... I love his instructions. As if we were going to to jump up on his hood. - Crapule? - What the hell?! Call the boss. It is Khorzov, my security chief. He is nasty and paranoid, but that's what I pay him for. He bothers you only if he thinks you want to hurt me. So if you want to hurt me, let him know ahead of time. In French. He does not speak English. Well, Mr Khorzov. I inform You of any evil intentions. They are a wise woman. - Clever and beautiful. - How nice of you to say. - Are you Jewish? - Why? My mother does not like, I go to bed with non-Jews. I must warn you: I am neither Jewish or virgin. Go immediately to the toilet! You've worked for Lehman Brothers. Yes. You have probably heard I got them to fail. Excuse me. I eat the same as you. What's wrong with you? Please alert us. - I can not steal, but seduce. - What is your plan? - To get close. - How close? - You're not French. - Russian. - Employs Monaco police aliens? - I'm Russian. - I do not work for the KGB. - KGB no longer exists. Now called the FSB. We work with Monaco and France's security police. Yes, of course. Should Monaco get you into the U.S.? Surely we can better serve you. It is a good news for you. Believe me. You get microphone on. - No. - That's an order! You do it because not on the first date, right? - Are you okay, Alice? - Yes. - Why? - You were long on the toilet. Can my urinary tract infection damage your boss? Only in the case of intercourse. So it should work. How did you so much into trouble in the U.S.? Like any stock exchange trades I am the perfect scapegoat. It is easier than to criticize the whole system. What did you do? The same as everyone else. I sold derivatives. - Were you hit by the crisis? - Should I put a figure on? - 700 million. - Because you bought my products. If you had worked for me, I had earned or lost on you? You would have lost dirty money and have earned clean. She is mad. Why mention you dirty money? Because I'm Russian? Sorry. It was just a bad joke. However, there is now also little truth in it. I have no idea where your money come from, but one thing I know. My Products dilutes everything. Risk, origin, volume. Do you have microphone? My specialty is lending the securities market. I hide case and transfers the risk to others. I did not invent the concept. I use it just. - Who got the idea for the lunch? - I do not remember. There is something wrong. Crapule not dare steal files, but he dare go into the microphone on? Yes, "he"! Are you in? We must say, "he's crazy". Even your cars might bugged. Your Boris is on thin ice. It is very strange. He does not do what we ask him. But doing things we did not ask him. I'm afraid he is out of control. - I'm trying to sniff out something. - No, he should go under the radar. The entire mission is already under the radar. Okay. So see, what you can glean. Ivan will meet with you tonight. Alle des Roses 10 Cap d'Antibes. The dialed number is not... He will meet tonight. Should I say yes? Not only. Let them know that someone knows where you are. They have arrived. Keep looking.

I could give them problems. - Do you know who he is? - No. - Ivan Rostovskij. - Ham businessman? Do you think You can catch up with him? - Are you with him? - No. But you will be the last night. So I have something to catch up with. Do you not be with me? - Are you Russian? - Do I look like a Russian? Why are you here, if you are not Russian? I felt sinful. And the name of the club appealed to me. Destiny means the "fate". Here everything will happen. - So good luck. - Thank you too. We must go now. You will hear from me. Should we drive you home? No, I take a taxi. We have lost Crapule of sight. He did not take a taxi, but just went. We tried to shadow him. We did our best, but there was heavy traffic. We lost sight of him outside the casino. - And Diamond? - He shadows him too. - Do you realize what this means? - Do not worry. He shook him. - He's looking like us. - Find him quickly. We're his apartment and put some men on the diamond. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Are you coming home? - Yes. I just wanted to hear if fate brought you something. Not that great. Not so far. I will find a place better suited to my mood. - Such as? - Maybe a bar called Disaster? So I know exactly where we are going. APOCALYPSE So you ruined the whole world? It's as style over. I fines for it. I can not take back and have to work here. What crime prompted you to write the biography? I have no idea what I was doing. Maybe it's something I want to do. I saw a dark thought. May I tell you something? I think I'm about to Nosse in it. - How does it feel? - Not so bad. - Suicidal, but not bad. - I do not think we balls in it. I think we are creating miracles. We are about to save an evening, as so hopeless. - I was the one with Rostovskij. - It's true. We sit here thanks to him. Cheers to Ivan Rostovskij. I have seen incredibly talented agents in the future for themselves - - Sudden low completely unexplainable error. In a split second destroys the their careers and their lives - - And are responsible for their own downfall. - Do you feel you are in good shape? - Why? In this mission I have for you, - There is no room for any mistakes. Two orgasms and hands, that gently caressing my ass. You deserve a medal. Moses... - What? - I love you called Moses. - It's hard to live up to. - It's not something you made up. I love it. That one looks too real. A skull and a horse with wings. What symbolizes? It identifies members of a gang. - You joker? - No. You're kidding. Are you delinquent? I was when I was younger. This must surely be my medal. I have done something good and won first prize. You have strong arms. Manly arms. Arms that just feels right. I feel I have come to port. It's ages since I've felt this way in a man's arms. Crime fragrance. My editor. He has never heard of the time difference. We have found him. - Where? - The hotel is near Nice with a lover. - How do you know? - Why else take on the hotel? - Where are you? - I'll wait outside. - Are you alone? - Hard to say. It is important to know. I can not see Diamond men. Crapule leaving the hotel. He gets into the taxi alone. The guy is still in the room. Sobsjak shadows him. I try to ask the front desk. Are you sure Diamond is not there? Not 100 percent. Apocalypse Friday. 20? So look to get going. - Do not be so angry. - You should call. I forgot it. I was full. Russians are hard to follow. - You did not call back. - I turned off the phone. - Do not yell at me. - I'll protect you. - The fire me, if you do it again. - You can not do anything. They know too well. - I'll always know where you are. - I was at home. Please keep me informed, dammit. Beautiful Alice. I'm taking you out for a ride. - Impossible. - It is absolutely possible. - Said to be with. - No. - Good morning, Alice. I know it. - Know what? Do you still want the job? Why should I have changed my mind since last night? Excellent. Where are we going? We just have to check a few things. A guy around 40 Maybe Canadian. Maybe journalist. We do not have much on him. Crapule rented room. In the bottom scraper really. - Our friend runs Crapule to Cannes. - Who follows them? Two cars in turn. Sobsjak hired reinforcement. - Where are they? - On the A8. Maybe he drives him his new property. It is in Cap d'Antibes. Can I trust you? Mr Khorzov adheres to me as a leech. He's skeptical. It is he. - You spent the night at a hotel. - I did. - Alone? - It is none of your business. Yes, very much if you go to bed with intelligence agents. Can we continue the conversation outside the car? - Impossible. - So set me off. I go. - Answer the question. - Then ask a pertinent question. - Do you have a girlfriend? - No. - Who were you saw with last night? - It belongs to privacy. Now you are the naive, Alice. Your attempt to scare me is absurd. - They took Adrets exit. - It is the revenge of the night. - How she shook them off? - He also shook you by. Yes, I met one last night. That's me. Keep your thoughts about it for yourself. It was a one night stand. I never see him again. If he's a cop, I did not. He asked not to you or my job. If he had intentions to ask, it's too late now. - And if he contacts you? - Then run a trip with him! - Get everyone back. - Are you sure? Where they're going, have Sobsjak no cover. Cancel it. - He's in danger without protection. - He is best protected by, we are away. If you would like to set down then it is now. - Well? - It is too early to say. - Why so whole circus? - We have no evidence. - You could nowhere find her. - She's a legend in the financial world. - You took me in the ass. - She takes you in the ass! Would you like to fuck her? Fuck just loose. But keep her far away from your business. I know a crafty bitch, when I see one, Ivan! Fuck! Should you put me in my place? - I'll pay you a fortune. - Exactly! So, are you even asking for it. I'm sorry about all this. You can understand that. Make some suggestions from this. If it goes well, we aim even higher. CIA LANGLEY, VIRGINIA Gregorij Ljubov. Specializing officer. Works only for the head of Third Division, Vladimir Tjerkatjin. We believe he leads the operation. He's doing everything shady. And it's damn not for newbies to spy Ivan Rostovskij. Ljubov is Tjerkatjins protege. At age 17 he was a member of the Russian mafia. He was arrested and sentenced to 20 years for murder. Tjerkatjin got him out and sent him to Paris to learn the language. Made him his soldier and sent him on missions around the world.

They contain everything you need. Diamond sent these images to a former colleague. They went happily to me, as they recognize you. Otherwise, we were right on the ass. Bang her? I ask you, if you bang her! Yes. You asked me to sniff something up. I did not ask you to sniff between her legs! How else would I find out more about her? I've said 117 times - - That there is no room for error in this mission. - You can destroy everything! - It is not an error. The idlers, you gave me is out of able to protect her. She has no mental training. She is the only Boris we have. - So everything goes according to plan? - Yes. Everything goes according to plan. You almost revealed yourself! What matters is the result. These are all his shell companies. You will soon have everything you need. Stay away from her. Understood? You must not approach her to you. - Your name is Alice? - Yes. It's fucking annoying that you smoke. It's your fault. You would not suck on me, so now I'll smoke. So it is now. - Well? - You were right. They followed me. Rostovskij must be paranoid. I saw them outside the bar and thought it was a bad sign. You are right. It was bad. Come on. - Do not it make you afraid? - What? - All this lusken around. - You're in the shadows. Not me. It was good that you came back. - The problem is, I have to travel. - Do you travel? I fly to Canada tomorrow. It occurred suddenly. If you return? Probably. But I do not know when. - How long do we have? - I have to fly tomorrow morning. Can I borrow your arms, until you come back? And your lips. Lend me your lips. Was that all? Why do not we run?

You are a fucking gift! - Who is it? - I do not know. - Who is it? - Beautiful Alice, it's Khorzov. - What do you want? - I have a file on you. - Place it at the door. - No, it's confidential. - Do you know what time it is? - I'm sorry. Ivan sent me. Lying bitch. Who do you work for? FSB? SVR? The police? - I'm just a friend. - A friend of who? For me? No. - Mr Khorzov... - Liar! Who do you work for? I'll call Ivan. I have to fucking see who I want. - Put the phone! - That's it. He has nothing to do with it. Stop! Shut up, bitch! Now we two have a little talk. If you call the police, I'll kill you. Do you understand, stupid cow? I'll kill you. - Where are you taking him? - We take a little ride. I'm not looking for trouble. - Who do you work for? - A book publisher. Call my boss.

Crapule hills beyond, if we do not help his friend. - Did he say that? - Yes. And it was not in affect. She was calm and stood firm. Tell him we are on the case. But no one must reveal their cover. I have seen incredibly talented agents in the future for themselves - - Suddenly commit completely unexplainable error. - Yes? - It is Moses. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. He drove me to a parking lot.

Holy shit! - We need to talk about something. - We are in the middle of a meeting. Did you send Alice to Moscow?! Rostovskij went to Moscow. He felt insecure after the captain of the guard's death. He insisted on taking her with him. - What happened to Khorzov? - We do not know. How is that going to? Can it conceivable Rostovskij suspects Alice? Why should he suspect her? The body lay in front of his villa. It is the Russian mafia warning. It was enough people with no manners. Rostovskij have no reason to to believe that Alice is behind it all. Is that why he abducted her? He took her, because he will continue to work. - Everything is in perfect order. - No. It is a matter of days. - If anything happens to her... - She will be properly protected. Of the two teams. One out of Ljubov, Second of Rostovskij. He goes nowhere without an army of bodyguards. - And what about when I move in? - So we get her out immediately. Do not worry. It is our work.

I would prefer you wait until I'm have settled into my new position. I need a rest. - It's not a good time. - It never is. Where do you want to go? - For Montreal. - Why Montreal? Why not? Okay.

And yet, in reality... ...you work for the CIA. What would happen if we fully public stood up and said - - The new head of the FSB was the which drafted the dossier - - About the man who worked hard that he should have the record?
