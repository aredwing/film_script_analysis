Before ourselves stands a couple that has known... ...how to love and respect each other in Gods eyes... ...and that after ten years... ...want to renew their vows. Jose Maria. Jean Paul. Congratulations on ten years of loving commitment. A hand for the lovely couple. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss, kiss. LA OTRA FAMILIA Mom. Mom. Mommy. Mommy. Mom. Damn bitch. Look, look. I love you. Mom? What are you doing up so late? Wheres your mom? Shes not here. How long have you been on your own? About three days. Alright. Where are you going? I got the few clean clothes he had. You ought to see that house. Its like a whorehouse. Beer cans all over the floor, joints... ... I even found a used condom. Hello. Hello. Yes. Now? Doesnt he have a dad? We dont know who it is. Grandparents, an uncle or aunt, any relatives? He doesnt have anybody, Jean Paul. I wouldnt have called otherwise. Why me? Dont be like this with me. Why dont you keep him? We cant, were leaving for Houston. Come on. Give me a hand here, please. Its just for a few days. I have a job. And tell me, what am I supposed to do with a kid... ...of that age? - Youve got Chema. Oh, cmon. Just come meet him. Youll fall in love. No, no. No, Ivan, no. Wheres my mom? Excellent question... Excellent question. Shes... sick. Shes feeling a bit under the weather. But as soon as shes better, youll go back with her. For now, youll stay with us. Who is 'us'? Youll see. You hungry? At least they fed you. And they gave me a warm bath. Good to know, son. Good to know. Are you my dad? No. No. I have no kids. But lets say Im your... ...little guardian angel. Its just for a while. I wanna pee. Can you hold it in? Were almost there, OK? No? No. Im coming. Im coming, Im coming. Come quick, come. Merci. Lower your pants. Like that. Meet Hendrix. Can he stay with us for a couple of days? This is Chema. Come, sit. Is this a joke? - No, it isnt a joke. Were doing Ivana... ...a favour. Is he her nephew or something? Hes the son of a friend of hers. Ill explain later. Coming. Who are you? What do you want? Where is Patrick? - I dont know, hes not here. Hold on, man. Let me be. I thought you guys were having a great fuck. Yep, super great. I dont know what you see in that asshole. I have everything... ...you need right here. Over my dead body. - All you need, bitch. Over my dead body. Relax. Relax. Im so fed up with you, Caiman. Tell that douche that he has a week to pay up... ...the tab he has with me. - You tell him and dont... ...get me involved in your shit. - Move aside, goddamnit. Move. I warned you. You know how I get when I dont get paid. Done? Im going to get you. Youll fall one day, you bitch. Im going to get you. Screw you, whore. Whatever were you thinking, Jean Paul? I couldnt say no. Theyre leaving tomorrow. What did you want me to do? I really dont know, but it isnt our responsibility either. Just what we needed. Hello. And if the mother acts like she didnt know a thing? We dont know who it is. Come on, dont be dramatic. Its just for a short time. When shes released, well give him back... ...and if not, well give him to Ivana and she can handle it. Shell know. Period. Youre so incongruent. I thought we were done with that subject. Yes, a friend of mine died around here. Hendrix? Hendrix? Im home. Do you think its OK? I couldnt hold it in. Youre not a doggie, are you? Dont scorn him like that. Ill change the sheets. Who does the cleaning? Me, right? Prepare the bath, Mrs. Chuy. And you, get out of those clothes, you stink. Come on, off with them. Youll get worms coming out your butt. Dont tell him that. Didnt you hear? Prepare the bath. Nina? Nina? Nina, wake up. Wake up. Wheres your son? Come on, wake up. Hes in his room. - Up, Nina. For Petes sake, Nina. Wake up, please. Come. Wheres your son? - Where are we going? Wake up already and come. Come here. Calm down. - Who are these assholes? No, no. Let me go. Let go. Easy, easy. Calm down. - Help. Theyre kidnapping me. - Lets go. Let me off. - Lets go. Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go. Let go of me. Who are you? Hendrix. 'Genrriz'? - Hendrix. What the fuck. Who gave you that name? Mom did. - Whos your mom? Nina. Nina? Well youve got some fucked up names there. Come. Wheres your lady mama? In the hospital. Why? - Cause shes sick. Sick with what? - I think she had a breakdown. Is she neurotic or what? A little bit. What are you doing hereabouts? 'Genrriz'? Where? - Here, this house. Jean Paul told me Im going to stay here... ...while mom gets better. - That so? So your mom is their friend. Dont know. Id never seen them. Did they tell you where to sleep already? I slept in the guest room last night. Alone or with the men? Alone. How old are you, 'Genrriz'? - Seven. Seven. Youre getting some little mars balls there, huh. At your age, I had a girlfriend. Not like other people. - Who? Other people just going around. They cant stand women. They just see them and they throw up. But youre a manly boy, right? Whats manly? Manly. It means you like the ladies, dont you? I like hanging around with boys better. What the.... You a sissy too? What is a sissy? Like... your relatives. - What relatives? Your uncles, don Chema and don 'YoPolo'. Theyre my uncles? Heaven forbid. Youre a little man, arent you? Not like the kind of men who get off on pushing up their beans. I like beans too. What the hell? Youre not the brightest crayon, are you. Just let me tell you. Dont hang around with them for too long. They say its contagious. And if it is, Ill be seeing you hang around the house... ...wearing a little skirt. - What are you saying? Im not a girl. Thats more like it. Thats the way. Come on, manly face. Attention. High five. Thats it. Leave. Leave. Hendrix, didnt they ever tell you its not polite... ...to enter a room without knocking first? Chema? Were off on the wrong foot. Very bad. And you, Mrs. Chuy, be very careful. I dont want to see the kid hang around my room. Got it? - It isnt my fault. Why leave the door open? - All the more reason. Look after him. Why me? - Because I say so. End of discussion. Jose Maria, the boy isnt to blame. - On top of everything I have to do... ...I have to guard the doors. Hendrix, dont you want to go out and play for a bit? Come on, go. Dont mind him, hes having his period. Ha, ha, ha. Great sense of humour. Funny man. No, no, no. Dont be nosy. This isnt yours. Whats up, Rafa? Let me out, will you? I have to go see my son, man. Dont be an ass. Dont insult me, you cookie. Up yours, asshole. Why were they kissing? Because... ...foreigners are like that. What am I, Mexican or a foreigner? Youre Mexican, like me. Gabino says I have the name of a foreigner hippy. Why do you listen to that ignorant dwarf? Do foreigners sleep in the nude? Stop asking that kind of questions. Do Mexicans? - Do Mexicans what? Do they sleep in the nude and kiss each other and stuff? No, boy, Mexicans dont. And neither do you. With all due respect, youre out of your freaking mind, sister. Just imagine if the boy comes out dumb, or crazy... ...or a druggie, or gay. My God, whod be the father? Youre crazy, Ivana. - This is how it goes. Let me explain it bit by bit. Listen. The egg would be Glorias... ...but I would have the baby. That way the kid runs no risks. Got me? Got it. How modern. How perverse. Why all the bullshit, anyway? At first we both wanted to get pregnant. Thats what I last learned. And finally, I gave in. - I see. But after analysing the situation... ...I came to the conclusion of wanting to be part... ...of the process too. I told her. Shes not very convinced yet... ...but Im sure shell end up accepting. Damn you, Ivana. Youve got a few loose screws. And whats my role in all of this? Thats the thing. Lets suppose that, for example... ...you were the donor. Me? The egg would be Glorias, but the genetic part would be us. It may even look like me. Right. Im sure Gloria thinks its an awesome idea. For sure, she agrees. Ivana, Gloria will have a shit-fit. She doesnt know yet. And, well? I want to know what you think. I think... ...I need more caffeine. Miss. Thats why I wanted to ask, Father. I say it isnt right. It may even be a sin. This isnt a confession, Jesusa. You need advice. Come out... ...join me out here. OK, Jesusa... ...what sin is it you talk of? Im surprised by your attitude. How long have you worked in that house? I stopped counting years, Father. Then you know your bosses. You know theyre good people. You know that kid couldnt be... ...in better hands than theirs. Yes, Father, but... ...I dont know why, but I feel like something wrong might happen to him. What do think might happen? That which you imagine, has nothing to do... ...with your bosses sexual preferences. Dont mix things up, Jesusa. - But Father. If you only knew how many questions the boy is asking me right now. I dont know what to answer. - Well, all you have to do... ...is see to it that the boy respects your patrons... ...spaces of intimacy. Thats it. Got it? - Yes, Father. Go to sleep already. Theres a lot to be done. May God be with you. Why do you have these ladies? Theyre my family, 'Genrriz'. Why cant I go into the hospital? Because theres a lot of sick people in there. You cant make any noise. - And if Im real quiet? No can do, 'Genrriz', my man. Stop thinking about that. You just wait and see. Your mom will get better soon... ...and send out for you. But I dont want to be left alone again. She wont. Thats why youre here with us, arent you? Whos your man? - You are. Wholl care for you? - You. There he is. Hendrix? Hendrix? What are you doing here? Come... ...Ive got a surprise for you. We have to unload some things off the truck. Yes, boss. Hey, little man. Right. Here. Alright. One... ...two... ...three. What do you think? I want to go see my mom. Where do you know Fidel from? He was a security in a joint where I worked some years ago. Im a DJ. In case you have an event or party. Is this what you do now? Not at all, no. No, Fidel told me about your problem. And I think we can help each other out. I know its a bitch to adopt here in Mexico, right? Youll be looking at least three, four years doing paperwork. And that is if they give you the baby. Yes, thats what I learned. Its a nightmare to adopt a baby. I know, I understand. But I know a boy whos amazing. The best thing that could happen to him would be... ...getting adopted by someone like you. How old is he? Hes seven or eight. Months old? No. Years, years. But hes a cutie. Hes a white, like us. Id think you and the missus are looking for a fine boy, arent you? No, we havent even talked about it. She has no idea of any of this. But really, man, I was thinking of a baby. Can I give you a friendly advice? What? If youre going into this, youd rather adopt a big boy. Youll save up on lots of shit. Hospitals, diapers, vaccines, you know. And the best thing is you know right away what he looks like. You wont get any surprises. I mean... ...you dont have that many options either. The boy I told you about is really something else. In fact, a couple of Italians just got in touch with me. Theyre ready to take him back home. Where can I see him? Yeah, hes pretty cute. Told you. And besides hes cool, this one. Hes not dark skinned like most? What do we have to do? Relax, relax. One... ...then the other. Very well done. I dont want to. - Come on, Hendrix. Just see. You have to learn how to swim, OK? What would happen if you fell into the pool? Come on. Relax. Relax. Relax already, Hendrix. Dont talk to him like that, he wont learn like that. You mind your own business and dont stick your nose into this. Go check on the soup. Ill be checking on you, son. The soup. Its burning. Hasnt something infected you? - Something? Syphilis? Gonorrhoea? STDs? No, no, what are you saying? Who does she think shes... ...talking with, Ioosey Goosey? No, baby. FYI, Im not promiscuous. Im just asking. You men are something else. Im just judging from the circles you move in. Gloria, there was no need for that. I take pictures of celebrities... ...but I dont fuck them. - Look. Yet. There are the results. They just came in. Hes a healthy boy. Are you sure of what youre about to do? Sure. Up to where I know, Im nothing more... ...than a simple sperm donor. If everything goes well... ...in nine months Ill become the beautiful uncle... ...of a baby. An uncle and thats that. Gloria, relax already. Give me your hand. I swear to you, Im not interested in becoming... ...anybodys dad, OK? But anyway youd have to sign... ...a kind of contract... ...in which you desist of any future claim. Gloria, dont get all hung up. Send me your girls with the... ...claim desisting thing... ...and Ill sign so you dont lose any sleep. One more thing. Its just... Ivana talked of economic compensation. Because, yknow, lately my sperm is rising on the market? Its practically a luxury item. So then... ...I wanted to know... - Sure, Ill send you a check... ...along with the documents youve got sign for us. OK. Dont even think of sleeping around much. Oh, no, of course not. OK. Any other questions or suggestions? You have a visa? And MasterCard, baby. Which one is more aggressive? The white shark or the bull shark? I think it must be the white shark... ...cause it bites like... - And the bull like... Get in, get in. - No, no. No, no. Lets play. Come on. Lets play. Water wars. - Water war. Close your eyes. Stand up straight, OK? Open up your legs. Gabino. Boss, you called? Do you need something? No, why? What are you doing here? You dont have to be in my room. Go to the yard. And close the door, the kid might catch a cold. Thanks. Lend me a hundred bucks. - No way. Shall I call you a cab? I got no dough, man. You got a smoke? - Sure. And who told you I want to adopt a kid? Nobody. I just thought it might be an option. Just wanted to give it to you. I cant believe you. It hasnt been a month and youre already saying this. But why dont you think about it? Weve got nothing to lose, Luisa. You think Im just going to forget about my baby like that? No, of course not. The thing isnt forgetting him. I just think another child... ...might help us overcome this. Wed have a reason to keep going. I lost him too, you know. Dont forget about it. So youre famous little Hendrix. Im famous? - Youre becoming famous. Sadly. Hendrix, brush your teeth. Lets go. Let me clean you up. Look that way. Come on. Lets go. One, two, three. Come on. Come on. Guys... ...be very careful. Sadly, there are people that can misunderstand... ...your good intentions. Well, we have spoken about this... ...to absolutely nobody. Its very clear. Not even to me. I thought this family wouldnt grow any larger. Or at least so I thought. And it wont. Its just an extraordinary event. Okay. As soon as the boys mother gets any better... ...you give him her son back and everythings alright. You stupendous, think. Where did you leave the boy? - Ivanas not answering the phone. Well, dont move from her fucking house till shes home. What are you doing here? Move on. You fucker, leave me. Dont push me around. - Calm down. Last night I went to her apartment and the doorman said... ...there isnt any kid at her house, got it? I give you two days... ...for that damn brat to appear. Two days. Two. - Heard me? Two. Since when do you care so much for my son, you fucker? I care for him more than you do, you idiot. Him being with your friend is in your best interest. Hurry up. So freaking irresponsible. - Fuck you. Got it, got it. Show me. Bravo, but youre not done yet. Youre halfway there. Excuse me, boss? Im done here. Okay, thanks. See you tomorrow. Well, I... I wanted to see if I could get permission from you... ...to take 'Genrriz' out for a while. At this hour? Where are you thinking of taking him? For a ride. Ill take good care of him. Its just so he gets some fresh air. You want to go with Gabino? Yes. No, you asshole. Yes, son of a gun. Thats the only way you can do it, you fuckers. Bastard. - Bastard. Shes from your family. Told you, 'Genrriz'. Mama. Look, look, look. Facing front, assholes. Mother Fucker, idiot. - Fucking idiot. Son of a fucking bitch. Feels a little bit weird that the kids not here, right? What are we going to do with Hendrix? Well... What any normal family does. I mean... ...Hendrix is a boy, not E.T. Honey, dont avoid the topic. To start with, his room is all made up... ...you went shopping and got him towels... ...clothing, toys. Dont you see? So? - So? So whats so bad about buying the kid what he needs? No, nothing. Nothing. - I dont follow you. Are you getting hooked? - No. Hendrix isnt going to be here forever. I dont think its good for you to get to attached to him. Youre creating false expectations for yourself. Oh... No. You created them from the moment you brought him here. Yes, I didnt ask you for it. And now you want me not to get too attached to him. Not to look at him, or pay attention to him... ...walk around the house like hes some kind of pet... ...and act like hes not here. Listen to me... ...I cant do that. - Course not. Course not. I want... I want you to know that at some point, sooner or later, hell go. I want you to keep it in mind. I want you to keep it in mind. As long as hes living in my house... ...Ill give him everything within our reach. Okay? Hendrix needs a normal life, Jean Paul. He needs... ...he needs friends, he needs to go to school. Even school now. You surely picked it already. - Well, yes, he needs to go to school. He needs to play, he needs... Keep it in mind. Shit, Patrick, were you hiding from me? No, why would you think so, Caiman? Wheres my money? Pay up, dirty bastard. Business isnt my thing. I love you, man. It isnt accumulative. Pay up. Pay up, bitch. - Give me a few days. A few days? Pay me now. Pay me now. What the fuck is the deal with that girl? Thats a felony. Theyll stick you in, Patrick dont be an idiot. Hello. - Whats up, Agustin? Its Patrick. Whats up, brother? - Did you think about it? Were still thinking about it. Know what? Give me a moment because I cant hear you well. Well, look... ...I thought about it... ...and wed like to meet the kid first. You know, interact with him a bit, right? Brother, I dont think youre catching my drift. The family I told you of already has asked for him... ...and if you dont act now, theyll take him next week. Yes, but we cant make a decision just like that. We want to see him. So what shall we do? Let them take him to Italy? What can I tell you? I mean... If things arent done like I asked you to, its going to be a feed up. Agustin, lets do this. I like you guys better than the Italians... ...and Id rather have the kid stay in Mexico. So then... ...Im going to call off the deal and tell them... ...there was a problem with his papers... ...and that he cannot leave the country, OK? But you have to swear youll give me half of the money... ...when I go with them. Deal? OK. Ill call you back, alright? Who were you talking to? Its getting late. Ill open. You go already. Where is Hendrix? Nina, calm down. - Where is he, you assholes? Hey, calm down, OK? - Calm down. You shut up, you idiot. Where is he? Give him back. Chill, hes doing fine. Your son is fine. Hes in good hands. Believe me. Not true. I want my son. Hendrix. Hes not with us. Calm down. Hes not here. You should be in rehab. Whats wrong with you? Look at yourself. Who let you out? Youre not okay. Give me my son back, please. What for? So youll abandon him again, as always. Youre a freaking junkie. Look at yourself, you cant even take care of yourself. Stop. No, calm down. Nina, Im calling the cops. I swear to you Ill call the cops if you dont calm down. Calm down. Your son is doing fine. Fine. But were not telling you where he is. Not until you get better. And until you can handle him... ...youre not seeing him again. Calm down. You have no right to take my son away. Nina, where are you going? Wait. Youre going to regret this. Nina. I dont agree, Luisa. Besides, what do you know of what the boy has been through? It doesnt matter what they tell you, you wont love him as a son. Instead of thinking stupid things like that... ...you should go get checked by a good doctor. Not like the quack Agustin took you to. Im going to have to speak very seriously with your father. That is child trafficking, in case you didnt know. And bringing those people here? - What do I do then, goddamnit? Luisa cant get pregnant again, and adopting a kid... ...in this fucking country is a huge mess. If what you want is to have a kid... ...give your mother and me a grandson, get another woman. Youre too young to have to do your life over, man. That relationship has never worked. Dont act dumb. And a child wont make things better. Itll just make them worse. Most of all if hes not yours. Ours. Get what Im saying? Youve got to help us out with this, Tomas. The kid has no school. That boy is never going to have a normal life, Jean Paul. What he needs is psychological assistance. Yes, we know, but... ...he also needs... ...to go to school. - That goes without saying. But I dont know if this is the best option for him. I dont want to have to imagine the faces the PTA will make... ...when I even suggest this. They can all go fuck Themselves, cant they? Honey, calm down. Jean Paul... ...you know who the PTAs members are? Yes. - You know how much they contribute... ...to this institution in a monthly basis? So then, Tomas, youre talking about money. I mean, come on. You should have told us beforehand... ...and wed saved ourselves... ...a couple thousand words. Money isnt a concern. In your specific case it isnt about money. Then what is it? - There are three variables. For example, this is a bilingual school. We need to know the kids academic level. Tomas, please, dont be ridiculous. Hendrix isnt applying for college. He only needs to see other people. Get along with them. Thats it. I dont know. Id have to do some heavy convincing to do... ...with the PTAs members. Theyre conservative people. Tomas... ...well owe you one. Maybe if you wanted to... ...contribute a large amount of money. I dont know. Maybe itll help us... ...build a pool for the school. Youre such a cynic. - Im not a cynic. Im realistic. The only way in which Hendrix can come to this school... ...is if he represents a benefit to the community. Sweetheart, hes right. Poor kids. They come to this school... ...in their luxury import cars with chauffeurs. Well fed. I guess youre thinking that for Hendrix, it might be better... ...if we enrol him in a public school. I mean, theres no need to be bilingual there. Economic contributions, right? - Lets see. If the problem is the PTA... ...why dont you let us do the talking? Why are you so afraid? Well, if the members have nothing else to say... ...then the most convenient thing is to talk with Father Tomas... ...because I think this is not our decision to make. Hes the one with the final say. One last thing, for all of our sakes. Avoid public displays of affection. - You censoring us, Tomas? Thats a way of saying it, yes. So I wont be able to grab my husbands butt in the school fair. Not in any way or manner. If you want to grab his butt, grab it at home... ...without the kid seeing you. No worries. After ten years with him... ...public displays of affection are well under control. I dont even get any at home. Thats bull. - Tomas, relax already. Oh. Right. Hello? - Listen to me, you asshole. If you dont want to be in deep shit... ...you two need to get the boy to me, now. Who is this? Youll meet me soon enough, and I dont think you want to. Dont you threaten me. Its OK to need help. When is mom coming out of the hospital? I dont know, Hendrix. We have to be patient, okay? Look at this one. Its great. Its OK to have a worm for a pet. Its OK to have several moms. Its OK to have several dads. Its OK to be adopted. Its OK to do something good for someone else. Its OK to be different. Youre special and important, just because... ...youre you. Is it OK if mom comes live here with us? Maybe. - Alright. Hit the sack, alright. - Come here. We have to go to school tomorrow. Your new school. Imagine that. Little guardian angel... - My sweet company... ...dont desert me... ...not at night, not by day... ...because if you leave me... ...Id be lost. In the name of the Father... - Of the Son... ...and of the Holy... ...and of the Holy Spirit... Amen. Come. Come here. Id like to introduce a new classmate to you. His name is Hendrix, and from today hes going to share... ...the classroom with you, OK? Welcome, Hendrix. - Welcome, Hendrix. I could give you the son you want so badly. That again. I dont understand what youre doing there. Me neither. I cant leave her. Now less than ever. Im not going to wait for you my whole life. I dont think its fair. Okay. Youve got the right to do whatever you want. Do I? Yes. If youd rather stick with Luisa, then dont call me anymore. How was your new school? - Cool. But I dont understand a thing. Why speak English if were in Mexico? Thats so you learn a new language. No, no. No sticking your hands into the plate, little boy. Thats why there are utensils. Why do you guys kiss each other in the mouth? Well... ...Chema and I are... Good friends. - No, no, no. Jose Maria. - Dont confuse him more, Jean Paul. Jose Maria. - Please. Bear with me. The boy understands. Jean Paul and I are a couple, OK? And we kiss each other because... ...we love each other very much. So youre boyfriends. Yes. Just like there are men who like women... ...there are men who like other men. Jose Maria, enough. - Come, Jean Paul. Alright? - Relax. Lets see. Its like with food. Do you like liver? - Dont know. I havent tried it. And dont even try it. You wont like it. - There you go. See? He doesnt like it. - But I do. And that doesnt make one better than the other. Not you... ...not him... ...not me. But one things for sure. Were different. Gabino says youre a couple of fags. One more comment... ...and youre out of this house. Got it? Yes, young man. Yes, boss. Little brat rat. I almost got the boot cause of you. It just came out. Forgive me? 'It just came out'. Just keep doing it, youll... See if I ever take you out to the wrestling matches. These two are crazy. They should be interned... ...theyre so crazy. Another one. - Why? I dont know why youre so freaked out. Nowadays everything is possible. That goes for you, darling. Us, the men, remain screwed up. It doesnt matter how much we fuck, he just wont get pregnant. Who lives here? No idea. Id never been here. Its easy to see you have a lot of money. I know Im a little... ...conservative for you, OK? And if that is your decision... ...I respect it. Its your life, in the end, right? But... ...I most definitely do not agree. I dont agree with it. Why dont you get another donor? Well I never... Werent you dying to become a father, honey? I didnt know that. Come on. Three Tequila shots and off you go. Go, go, go, a bit more. Cause this one wont take it, even if it came in a plate. And you? - What about me? Dont want to do it? - No. Yes? May I? Just a little. Ivana? Enough. Oh God, so stressful. Sorry, Gloria. Sorry. OK, my friend. Girls stick with girls. And you come here. Boys stick with boys. Sorry, sorry, Gloria. I mean it. In practical terms, the one thats giving it... ...her genetics is you, Gloria. You will be the mom. No, only to a certain point. Because our friends are playing God. Honey, Ivana will give birth, and its her brother who is... ...donating sperm, right? Yes, but shell act as an incubator. Sorry, Ivana, but that is it. Its like those American ladies who rent out their womb... ...and then give the kid... ...to Ricky Martin. Well, yes. No. Chema, no. Our cause is different. Its got nothing to do with it. Sure. Besides, I also think... ...than neither Ivana, nor any other woman... ...can be a simple incubator. I mean... ...from the moment shes inseminated, the product... ...eats from her, and it depends emotionally... ...and physically from her. But it isnt hers, hon. Of course Id also be that babys mom. Course she is, Chema. Shed be the mother. The baby is connected to her. Its inside her, for Petes sake. - Hey... ...dont you think this subject has run dry? Lets quit it, OK? OK, but one more question. Oh, for... - Just one more question. Why not do it the old fashioned way? Each one uses their own egg. Because we dont feel like it, OK? - No, actually... ...whats going on is... ...Gloria is doing really well in her job nowadays... ...and... ...it just wouldnt be very prudent to get pregnant, right? Besides, Ivana is 27 and Im 42. Sure. - Makes any sense. Yes, totally right. Some cold blood, right? Next thing we know, ones going to be able to order... ...a baby on the Internet. - OK, stop it. Sure. To the future moms. - Cheers. To the future moms. And to Georgioildonatore. Now you speak Italian. Me, donor? Hey, changing the subject a bit... ...we have something important... Actually, I have something important to tell you. Oh, no, no more. Mercy, please. Mercy. I knew this wasnt going to end well. What did you think? That she was going to kick the crack habit in a spa... ...with a few aspirins? Come on. Course not. But I didnt think this dumb bitch was going to run away. Im so cold. Switch the heat on. Its cold. Oh. Calm down. Calm down. - What do you want? Im not going to mug you. Did you come see the kid? Remember me? The boy isnt here. Oh. No? - No. Well, I figure he is. Look... ...youre not his mothers. Nina desperately wants her son back. Im going to help her get him back. We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. So if you dont cooperate... ...Im going to sue you for kidnapping him. And then youll go to jail. You have no right to take him from his mother. Dont be such assholes. Nina cant handle him. Thats not your problem, mama. The boy can stay with me... ...while she gets better. - Is that right? You fucking junkie. You calm down, OK? If you dont want a fist to the face. I want that boy at Ninas tomorrow, got it? Got it? - Yes, yes. I dont know what to do. If to give the boy back to his mother or report her... ...or if to give him to the police or the authorities. Hendrix isnt leaving this house. Heard me? Yes, I did. But we cant do this. The mother wants him back. Come on. Shall I remind you that his mother is a junkie that abandoned him? That isnt our problem? Do you know the trouble were stepping into? We should have thought about it beforehand. Too late, honey. Good night. The boy leaves this house tomorrow. Are you sure? Yes. Fine. If he leaves... ...I leave with him. We cant do anything. Cant we? Whos preventing me from doing it? HOLY CROSS CHILDRENS HOME Whats up? Why are you shutting down? Cause Im done. Youre really drunk, arent you? No, Im fine. I just had some drinks with a few clients. Im going to take a bath. I feel hot. As we do every month, we have a parent over... ...to talk about his job. It is Hendrixs turn now. He asked us to invite his dad over. Quiet, please. Welcome. Hello. Hello. My name is Jose Maria, but you guys... ...can call me 'Chema'. Im Hendrixs dad. OK. Im going to tell them a bit about what I do, OK? Yes. Alright. Right now... ...Im a homemaker. My job is... ...to keep the house clean and tidy... ...and make this little fellow do his homework. And all the things that normally a mom does. But it wasnt always like that. Im a designer. And some years ago, I was a model. The kind you see modelling clothes in magazines and commercials. Have you seen that? - Yes. Just like that. Pablo, please. Is it true Hendrix has two dads? Yes, it is. His other dad is called Jean Paul. And hes a great publicist. Alex. My dad says youre gay. Do you know what that word means? Alright, look. A gay person is a person who likes... ...another person of the same gender. So a man that likes another man. Or a woman that likes another woman. But if you have any other doubts... ...ask your daddy. - Well, that would be it. Sadly, Hendrixs dad has to go... ...so lets see him off with an applause, please. Lets take things as they are, Tomas. Goodbye, guys. - Leave, please. Goodbye. Okay, kids. Why doesnt Hendrix have a mom? I do. But shes on a trip, right? Wasnt she in the hospital? Well... ...that hospital is in the USA. Is she sick? She left to have some tests done, Pablito. And you two are his moms husbands? No, Pablito. It is not like that. Hendrix has his mom, and he also has us. Eat, boy. The foods going to get cold. I am eating. Dont be stubborn. That guy is not going to stop bothering us. Dont you get it? What do you want me to do? Give him the boy? I will not. Its George. Hi, George. - Hello. You scared us, man. Hi. Hi. What happened? Did you get the contract? Yes, I wanted to talk about that. Couldnt be in another moment? I mean... - No. No. Its just... Ive been thinking... ...I dont think its going to happen, OK? What? - Just like that. Im embarrassed and sorry, but I think you girls... ...should start searching for another donor because... ...I cant. Its too complicated. - Hold on, hold on. What do you mean, its not happening? We had made a deal. Im so sorry, sweetie. Im sorry, but its too complicated. Dont fuck with me, George, okay? Dont do this to us. I just bought the tickets to Houston. I know, Gloria. Im embarrassed, really. Sorry. Hold on. Where are you going? Tell me, what is going on with you? - No. Whats wrong with you? Can you let me go, please? - Of course not. Hey... I just came to let you guys know, OK? You cant force me to do something I dont want to, OK? Ive been thinking and... ...I dont want to be no childs father. You arent going to be anybodys father. Youre going to be a donor, and thats it. Wed talked about it. Really, dont worry. Theres no problem, George. What do you mean, no problem, Ivana? Whats wrong with you? You know how much this stupid deal is going to cost me? Calm down, Gloria. We have an appointment in Houston next week. What are you playing at? Dont talk to me like that, you fucking bitch. Its precisely because of that that I want no part in it. To think that my own sister... ...will have a son of mine. Dont fuck around. Thats called incest, it doesnt matter how you paint it. I want no part of that mess, OK? Excuse me. Please... - What are you talking about? Youre sick in the head. - And youre beautiful, honey. Ivana, think about it. You know what? I dont want to see you ever again. Dance here, on the stage. Come up. Applauses for Hendrix. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Someone is looking for you. Who is it? Who told you your son is here? Ivana. She told me you had him. Im very sorry. There must be a mistake. As you can see, theres no place for any boy here. So you wont give him to me. Im sorry, but... ...I dont know what youre talking about. If you want, we can dial... ...Ivanas number and clear this up. Yes? He also knew the lions were the kings of the jungle. Why cant I go out? - Because the gentlemen... ...are taking care of some things with other people. Talk a little quieter, alright? Yes? - Ivana. Chema, whats up? A woman came to the house, claiming to be... ...Hendrixs mother. How do you know his name is Hendrix, fucker? Let me go. Didnt you say he wasnt here? Calm down, lady. Let me go. I want my son. - Your son isnt here, lady. Let me go. This woman is going crazy. Dont tell her hes there. Hold on. You know what? Ill just put her on the phone and clear things up. Hendrix. A piece of paper... - Its my mom. No. Hendrix. - No, no. Yes, its my mom. Nina is at Chemas. Im heading over. Ivana, dont be stubborn and Keep out of it. Hendrix. - No, no. Its my mom. Let me go. - Lady. Hendrix. Wait, wait. Mommy. - Calm down. I want my son, you fucker. - Calm down already. Calm down. Alright. Your son is here. You see, fucker? Hurry up, already. Give him to me. - Im going to go get him. But I want you to calm down. Calm down. No. Mom. Hendrix. Hendrix. - Mom. Hendrix. Hendrix. Stop already. Didnt you say he wasnt here? - Dont hit me. Didnt you say he wasnt? - Dont hit me because... ...Ill hit back, even if youre a woman. OK? Id like to see you do it. - Dont hit me. Fucker. Dont hit me. Jean Paul. - Go ahead. Hendrix. - Jean Paul. Sons of Bitches. Mom. - Hendrix. Sweetie. How are you? I missed you so much. Im OK. Hes Chema, and hes Jean Paul... ...shes Mrs. Chuy, and hes Gabino. Come see our room. Its awesome. No, no. Were going home. Come. Wait, wait. Why dont you think it over? The boy is very well taken care of in here. And you have to see a doctor. Do I? Were not staying here? This isnt your home, Hendrix. Understand it already. Lets go. - Hey, hey, whats the matter? No, dont... As a matter of fact... ...the kids not leaving. You got it? You got it? - Lf I got it? Out of my way. - Try moving me. Calm down. Calm down. Chema, shes his mother. Shes his mother. Lady... ...before you leave, why dont you ask Hendrix... ...what does he want? Hendrix. What do you want to do? Do you want to leave with your mom... ...or stay with us for a bit... ...and your mommy can come visit any time she wants. What do you think? - I want to stay here... ...with mom. - Hendrix, this isnt your home. And I dont know these people. Lets go. Mom. Come on. Theyre nice people, mom. They gave me a room and bought me stuff. You can come visit him any time youd like, while we... ...find you some help. Lady, dont go. Let me give you my number. Just in case. Im going to say goodbye to the boy. Lets go already. Bye, Hendrix. I love you very much. Move. Mom, open up. Look whos waiting for you. Thats it. Didnt you see? Whats up, my champ? Where were you? Why arent we leaving with Chema? Because this is your home, Hendrix. Get it already. Everything is going to be OK. Go out and play. Im going to pick things up. Its the sign. Too Torres, from where? Vera turns. Its the chance to score for a draw. Atlas is looking to... He wont talk to anyone. I had never seen him so depressed. Jean Paul, Im so sorry. I just... I only wanted to help, and look. When help comes from people like us... ...its never going to be seen with good eyes. To accept our condition, one either has to be really smart... ...or really fucking dumb. Because... ...life doesnt give you the tools to deal with this. Im not so sure I want to bring a child into this world. You still feel sick? Ill feel better. Im sorry. I promise Ill take care of you. And you know what? Were going to go on a long trip... ...and buy a beautiful house. Yes? Little brat... ...smelly again. He likes balls... ...big and small. Its Hendrix... ...and he likes to sing. Hes a good boy... ...and hes going out to play. What do you want? What are you doing here? I just brought your medicine... ...so youll feel better. Mom? What are you doing? What are you doing? Go to your room. Hendrix. Hello? Hello? What are you doing? Nothing. What happened? I dont know. Who was it? - I lost the call. Hendrix? Answer, theyre talking to you. Hendrix Montoya Cabrera. Hes a bit shy at first. But hell be OK in a minute. Youre beautiful. I told you, didnt I? I want to go home. In a minute. Look, Agustin. Im going to tell you the truth so youll trust me. His mom and I, we had some issues years ago. But shes a crazy junkie. Shes locked up in a farm. She hasnt seen him in years, and shes not interested. And Hendrix has no dad. She doesnt even remember whos the dad. Ive tried to care for him... ...cause he aint got nobody, right? But its really hard, man. And I just cant handle it any more, man, I just cant. Id rather he gets a good family. No? NINA MY NUMBER Answer, damn it. But how does it go? Have you got the boys documents? You see... ...I signed him up with my name. But Im not his dad. If we make a deal, Id give you everything. Id do the paperwork... ...for the kid to be in your name... ...so you have no problems. I want to go with my mom. - Wheres your mom? At home. Shes sick. What is she sick with? - I dont know. He gives my mom her medicines. And that makes her ill. Is he a relative of yours? Hes a friend of moms. But hes bad. Hold on. Whats up, Hendrix? Inventing stories for the lady again? Hes got a big imagination. He loves to invent stories. Right? What are you doing? - Calm down. Im sure that guy stole him. Chill, alright? Or you wont ever see your mom. Hear me? I want to go. Youre staying here until your mom gets better. No, no, no. - Smile, you little fucker. Tell them a thing about your mother again and you wont see her again. Got me? Did you get it? OK. Patrick. Its just hes shy... ...because he doesnt know you, but... ...I got through to him. You can keep him for a couple days... ...get to know him and live together. Yes. Well keep him for a few days. Done. - OK. It feels terrible... ...but its for his own wellbeing, right? Just dont forget what we agreed on, brother. Just half, just half. Right. To whose name? Patricio Javier... ...Montoya... ...Sarmiento. Here you go. Were all done. Ill come by in a few days. Just leave me something to contact you by. Your address and... Agustin here has my number. Ill come by on Tuesday, OK? To collect on the remainder. Give you his papers, clothes, and stuff. Sure, but leave us an address... ...and another number. Just in case, you know. What if he gets sick? God forbid. Hello? Good afternoon. Mr. Jean Paul Jaubert? Yes, this is he. Im Mrs. Luisa de Lascurain. I dont know if you know him... We have Hendrix here. Yes, of course. Hed like to talk to you. Sure. Let me put him on the phone. Allow me. Chema. Hello? Hendrix, son. How are you? Where are you? Here. But here where, sweetie? Where am I? Dont be a fucker. - None of your business. Punch him. Done and done. Were done, fucker. Leave already, and dont bother coming in tomorrow. Whats up, Caiman? I got your money. Its fucked up, you fag. When have I failed you? Dont be like that, man. Thats it, man. Good, Patrick, my man. Youre really something else. No, its even endorsed. No problem, man. If it bounces, you better start digging a hole, huh. Im on bad terms, even with my lady friend. You chill, or Ill squeal. Im taking a loudspeaker, man. Man. Whats wrong? Youre going out? Yes. Hendrix showed up. Nina dumped him again. Ivana, I need to talk to you. - I dont have time now. Where are you going? Im talking... - Bye. Who are you? This is Jean Paul, Im Chema, and... ...were responsible for Hendrix. Im sorry, but I dont follow. What do you need to understand? Its a bit of a long story. We have a common friend. Shes the one that picked up... ...Hendrix, the first time around. She asked us to take care of him while the mother... ...got straight again. And that hasnt happened. Thats it. I see. But then... I mean, you... ...are... - Boyfriends. Well, yes... But, come on... We think its important for Hendrix... ...to keep living with us. With all due respect, I dont think its good... ...for the boy to live with you. And... with all due respect, right? Who are you to decide what is best for him? Im nobody. But he should at least live with... ...a normal family. Right? I mean... Poor kid. Who gave you the right to judge us without even knowing us? Lets see. Calm down. Everything is cool. She should keep tabs on her words. I mean, Jesus... Who does she think she is? - Jose Maria. Chema. Why dont we calm down? Right? Lets see. What do you want to do? I want to go. Please, dont do this to him, OK? Hes hardly at an age where he can decide where to live. The logical thing would be for him to stay here. You know what? Hold on. I couldnt care less about what you think. This is not up for discussion. The kid leaves with us. Hold on, brother, hold on. Unless you want to have a problem. Did you already do all the stuff I left you? Wheres Hendrix? For Petes sake. Did you lose him again already? Nina, youre something else. Where is he, you fucker? Last night he was in bed with me. Where is he, you fucker? How the fuck am I going to know? Why dont you ask... ...your fucking friends? Who took him the last time? Ivana said she didnt have him. And you believe her. Of course theyre not telling you. The fags must have him. - What fags? They have him. Lets go. - Calm down. Come with me. - Nina, Nina. Chill, snort a bit. Another one. Try to remember where you picked him last time. I dont know. Why are you doing this to me? You dont even know what freaking day today is. Hendrix. I have to go get Hendrix. Lets go. In a minute. In a minute. Fucker. This is my son. - In a minute. Chill. What did you want me to do? To go into a fight with them? You didnt see how hysterical that crazy bitch was. Besides, the kid wants to go with them. Of course. Because hes an adult that can make his own decisions. Hes a freaking boy. Didnt you see him? Why did you let him go? Luisa, you arent planning on keeping the kid. Dont fuck with me. Thats called child trafficking. You didnt see the guy. Why did you give him a check then? What are you telling him... ...when they come looking for the kid? You have any idea of what they can do to us? Calm down, I didnt sign the check correctly. Im not the idiot you think I am. That asshole isnt coming back here. And if he does, Ill beat the shit out of him. Why did you let the boy go? Do you know what that pair of degenerates might be doing to him? Calm down. In the end, that freaking brat isnt even my kid. I dont give a damn. Youre a dick. So what if he isnt your son? Hes still a child. If those perverts do something to him... ...itll be your guilty conscious to deal with, and your fault. What did you want me to do? Have a fist fight with them? Just you wait, Im going to beat them all to high hell. Whore you calling? Your daddy, so he fixes your problem... ...like always. - Shut up, dumb bitch. Its thanks to my daddy that you have food and a roof. Yes. Maam, I want to report a child as stolen. Move. Scoot. Jesus, sorry, sorry. Anonymous, maam. Stay there. Do they have any idea where the mothers child... ...may be? She is sure to be with that bum... ...and we dont know where he lives... ...but he wont take long to come by. Anyway... ...if someone asks... ...or knocks on the door, or we get an unknown caller... ...nobody knows anything about Hendrix. In this house, there are no kids. Got it, Gabino? Mrs. Chuy? Nobody comes into this house without me signing off on it. Jean Paul, Im sorry, but... ...this is a very serious felony. No, no, Tomas. We just want to protect the kid. Protect the kid, just that. Im going to talk to the lady and the guy... ...and offer them money so theyll let us be. Thats it. Gentlemen... ...whether we like it or not... ...we have to hand the child over to the authorities. No, no, no. Sorry, Tomas, but no. Thats not happening. No? - No. No. Sorry, but I cant be a part of this. Tomas. Jean Paul, this has gone too far. I helped you to the point I could. Tomas. - Stop. Let him go. Does anyone else want to leave? Gabino? Mrs. Chuy? Ivana? The door is open. Calm down. - Why calm down? Sorry, Jean Paul. But Nina wont sell her son. No, she doesnt. She just cuts him loose every third day, right? Yes, but for other reasons. Who are you selling? You want a beer? Nina? Nina? What the...? Nina? What the hell, crazy bitch. No way. No way. Nina, what the hell. Nina. Nina. No way. No way. Fucking Nina. Help, goddamnit. Help me, man. Some help here. Go, open. Open. Carefully. Hurry up. Hey? And what if they arent what we think they are? Youre the one that didnt like them, werent you? Yes, but not enough to call the cops. Right. Now it turns out its my fault. I never told you to bring the kid. You never told me not to, either. Alright? Pick up. Its work. Answer her already. She even left you a message a while ago. Who are you talking about? Your girlfriend. Girlfriend. Stop saying dumb shit, will you? Youre something else. Fucking liar. Forgive me. No. No, Ivana. Not again. Hold on, Blondie. Hold on, hold on. Hold on, goddamnit. Why didnt we go pick up my mom? Because... ...your mom is sick, Hendrix. She needs a doctor. She cant be here. Okay? Why do they say at school that I have no family? What a thing to say. What are we, then? Chopped liver? Were flesh and bone, boy. Hey... hey... ...remember not all kids have a mom and a dad. Some live with mom... ...some live with dad. And others... - Live with grandpa and grandma. Exactly. Every case is different, Hendrix. That makes us a family, right? Of course. - Yes. And well always be together. Always. Youll never leave me, right? No, honey. No. No. Never. Were never leaving you. Not ever. Not ever. Carnoy solution. One mg of adrenaline. Starting heart treatment. One, two, three. No response. Atropine, three mgs. One, two, three. Time of death... Hey... ...after party. Thats it, man. What the hell, Patrick? - Whats up, man? Your fucking check bounced. - No way, man, no way. No way, man? Really. - Hold on man, hold on. Hold on. And I took a friend to a swinger bar, man. It was hilarious. Hello? What the fuck, man? Your check bounced. Hold on, brother. Whats up, Patrick? - Your check bounced, you ass. No way, man. How odd. But dont worry. If you want to, Ill meet you later. Im on my way out. Ill give you the full sum... ...because I think were keeping the boy. Look, you asshole, dont try to play it smart. If you dont give me the money, you hand the boy back over today. And youre in deep shit too. No, calm down, man. I know. It must be a mistake. At what time and place can I see you, you dolt? I dont know. Calm down, dude. Calm down. Mr. Patricio Montoya? That isnt me. - Will you come with us, please? Hold on, man. - In you go. Youre hereby declared... ...guilty... ...of kidnapping... ...and sexual... ...harassment... ...of the minor named... ...Hendrix... - Sir? ...Montoya. Sir, I havent said that. Let me finish. Of the minor named... ...Hendrix Montoya Cabrera. I reserve my own right to declare... ...until I have my lawyer in the room. What happened? He wont talk. Do you know the kind of welcome parties they give... ...in there to assholes like you? Fucking paedophile. Did they touch there, son? What did those men do to you? What am I doing here? Calm down. Were here to help. Im going to ask a little favour of you. Take off your clothes. Im going to do a checkup. I didnt sell him. What is your relation... ...to Mr. Jean Paul... ...Jaubert? And Mr. Jose Maria Fernandez? Never heard of them. Dont know them. Damn it. Holy Mary... ...Im so sorry for having doubted these gentlemen. Theyre good people, Virgin Mother. Be charitable and bring them back home... ...and let all problems be fixed... ...particularly with the boy. Were leaving. Let me tell you before we go... ...about something we really consider to be important. This morning... ... south of town, Jean Paul Jaubert was arrested. Hes being held responsible... ... for the kidnapping and abuse of a minor. There are other two detainees. Jose Maria Fernandez and Patricio Javier Montoya Sarmiento... ... also known as Patrick. Theyre being held accountable, and this is the big deal... ... that we have to make... ... news of tonight. Presumed members of a paedophile group. Theyre all at a County Detention Centre. Thanks to all that make this broadcast possible. Have a good night. Well be back here tomorrow at 10. Goodbye. COUNTY DETENTION CENTER KIDNAP AND SEXUAL ABUSE Look, Jean Paul, its a very delicate situation. This is a crime that is prosecuted ex officio. On your side, there is the fact... ...that there is no formal accusation. It seems to have been an anonymous call. Obviously the child presents no signs of abuse... ...and they didnt find semen in his lab tests. Im in talks with the Attorney General so... ...we can try to fast track this... ...but youre going to have to stay here for a while. I need you to be patient. How is Hendrix? Thanks. NO RUNNING, NO YELLING, NO PUSHING What are you looking at? Dont cry, you faggot. Youll get used to it. Dont want your grub? Then give me some here. Go. Go. He wants to cry. He wants to cry. He wants to cry. He wants to cry. You fuckers. Go already. Run, quick. Hold on, man. No, calm down. Calm down. Go, sweetie. You know who sends you his best. Dont try to outsmart us again. Lets go. Just relax, thisll take only two seconds. Here... ...we go. Here you go. Welcome to motherhood. Two, use polite words. - Use polite words. Three, listen carefully. - Listen carefully. Four, cooperate with others. - Cooperate with others. Going straight to the point, we came to propose this. We feel like helping you... ...as long as you hand over the boys custody. How do I know youre not going to screw me over? So far the one thing you know... ...is that if you dont help us, youre stuck here for the next 20. That, plus murder in the first degree. Help us, and well help you. But it has to be now. Daddies. Lets go home. I dont want to be here anymore. Lets go. Sit down with us. We have to talk... ...about something with you. Son... ...we cant go yet. Why? I dont want to be here. Sweetie, I know. But for now, we cant. Dont get like that. Look. Theres been a problem... ...and youre going to have to stay here... ...for a few days. While we fix the problem. Werent we a family? Werent we going to be together? - We are. We are a family. And were not giving up. Son... ...listen to me. I dont know what well have to do... ...but I promise well take you away from here. Well be together. Do you believe us? Do you? Hendrix... ...we have to talk to you. About your mom. I dreamt of her last night. She came to say goodbye. Were going through a terrible crisis. And... ...we thought... - We thought? Well... ...I thought... ...therapy is... ...what could help us... ...save our marriage. Let me go, you fuckers. Let me go. Let me go, asshole. Get a move on, idiot. - Let me go, asshole. Lower him. Jesus, Caiman. You really went over, dude. - No way. You went way over, dude. - Chill, man, dont do this to me. You went way over, Motherfucker. I swear to you, Caiman, it wasnt me. Raise him. No way, Caiman. I... Were taking you for a ride through heaven, daddy. ...run away. - Run away. They left... Miss... ...may I come in? - Yes. Sure.
