What did you say? - Exactly what she said. - Oh, dear. My darling. What a lovely surprise. Is it really you? I can hardly believe my eyes. When did you arrive? You haven't been here all night? I was on duty last night, as a favour to a fellow officer. If only I'd known. - Why didn't you warn me? - Didn't you receive my letter? And I must be off, we're on manoeuvres today. Parades, brass bands, you know... They're waiting for me. - You didn't get my letter? - But if only I had. Just think... A whole night with you. What a dream. What did you tell your family? That you were taking the morning train? You're so clever. Tonight, as soon I'm off duty, I'll wait for you here. But this morning, France needs me. I waited for you all night. France can wait a few minutes. - A few minutes? - To answer my question. - You didn't receive my letter? - If I had received it... Then it would be in this drawer? And here it is, unsealed. Darling, I can explain everything. But not now. - Come back later. - Now's the time for explanations. - What did you throw out of the window? - The key. The key? - Cavalryman. - Yes, sir? - Find the key that's fallen down there. - Where? I don't know. Look for it. You see? A moment's anger and the whole town is informed. - I'm thinking of your reputation. - But you leave my letter next to these. Monsieur Armand de la Verne, Yvonne, Rose... Therese, who can't spell, Odette... There are even two Odettes. My dearest... - My men are in the saddle. - Is that your only answer? I will answer you tonight, here, when you return. - There's no more to be said. - Gisele. Goodbye. My darling, I would have told you... Sir. The key. My brother has closed the window, I can hear you better now. My brother? Yes. - Are you coming to the Red Cross Ball? - I don't know yet. He's definitely coming. My sister asks if Lieutenant de la Verne has taken care of the singer? I shall ask the colonel. Olivier. Isn't Lieutenant de la Verne a friend of Mille Therese? I'm no authority on his affairs. Do you know this Therese? - Will you always remember him? - "Always" is only for love songs. - And that one? - She's a young lady. - I thought he might even marry her. - And? That's when he met Gisele. - No, that's Leontine. This is Gisele. - And the young lady? - The police chief's daughter. - The one who's getting married? Come, now. If you'd told me, I'd have met you at the station. There's no need to cry. - You like Dragoons, do you? - Yes, Mime Mathilde. You can look as much as you like through the window. But take my advice. When they're here, don't look too closely. - Until tonight, la Verne. - Until tonight. Tell me, my sweet. Won't you look at me? - Mime Mathilde told me. - Not to look at men? She's right. All of these gentlemen are very friendly, but if one of them becomes too friendly, don't listen to him. - And come and tell me. You understand? - No, sir. I'll explain. One of them stops you as you pass by. Then, playfully, he takes your hand. Stop. He's already gone too far. Because if he holds your hand, he'll hold your waist and if he holds your waist, he'll try to kiss you. And he mustn't. You have plenty of time. We'll talk again. Come along. The Red Cross. - The colonel's wife awaits. - Forward march. A soldier's life is discipline, duty, sacrifice. We have nothing more to say to each other It was all but a game between us A last kiss will suffice As our farewell Those words of love were merely in jest Merely in jest One says "always" One says "never" One says "I swear" or "I promise" Such seductive words Those great oaths, you see Have no place in the trifling games of love I listened to you for my own pleasure But now I would like to remain silent If you were saying "Always", "Never" If you loved me - Aren't you dressing? - No. - You're coming to the dinner? - It'll be all men. It wouldn't be the first time. What's wrong? - I'm sad. I think I'm in love. - Who with? I don't know. - And last night? - That doesn't count. What do you think of the girl across the street? No, that's not it. Do you know what I need? Love at first sight, like in a fairy-tale. I would go to her and I'd say: Madame, or Mademoiselle, you are the one I've been waiting for. If you knew how long I've waited. Have I ever loved? I thought I loved, but my heart is pure. - I'm lonely, so lonely. - I'm lonely, so lonely. Do you know what I tell myself in my lonely room each night? She doesn't love me. She'll never love me. I want to flee from her, yet I come back to her. I want to die. But each day I pray I'll live so I can see her again. Who's this hussy that's making you suffer? I haven't met her yet. Lie too often and no one will believe a word you say. Mathilde. I'm lonely too, so lonely. - You don't have the knack. - You mean I don't have the uniform. Gentlemen, it's not you they love, it's your costume. If I wore it too, I'd be bolder than you. If I were Lieutenant de la Verne, do you know how I'd choose my next mistress? Like this. - In one month, we leave on manoeuvres. - But the night before we go... - A grand dinner. - No expense spared. We civilians will pay, if Mr. de la Verne wins his wager. - But if he loses, the officers pay. - Agreed. And what's your wager, if I may ask? Not a word, gentlemen. We are sworn to secrecy. A lady's honor is at stake. - On official paper. - One has to do things properly. Mr. Armand de la Verne, Lieutenant in the 33rd Dragoons... - Here. - ... undertakes to become the lover... Manners, please. .. undertakes to obtain the favors of Mme... Mime who? Will you get out of here. What are you up to? - ".. undertakes to obtain the favors... - The favors. .. the favors of Mme... " We leave a blank here for the name. - How will we choose her? - ".. of Mime X, before the regiment goes on manoeuvres. " "That day a grand dinner will be held by the civilians or by the officers... " - ... etc... Signed by witnesses... - What do I sign? - Your name, Ciboulette. - And me. - And me. - Me. - The lady's name? - We shall know in a minute. - All the ladies in the town are here. - All the ladies in the room. - An innocent hand will pick the name. - Me. Me. Quiet, quiet. Who is the youngest recruit? It's Rose-Mousse. - You mustn't look. - Close your eyes. It's the patrol. - You're in uniform. - So what? The colonel forbids us to come here in uniform. Run. The kepi. - Lieutenant? Your sword. - Thank you. And your kepi. The papers have fallen out. Never mind. We'll do it again. I hope the lady will be pretty. I'll let you know. - Promise? - I promise. And if she isn't pretty? You'll console me? It's idiotic. Walk. - Idiotic? - Your wager last night. - I like the unexpected. Say a number. - Five. One, two, three, four, five. Halt. You there, riding Magali. Come here. Turn around. Nice coat, nice leg, nice neck. You see, you can trust to luck. Number three. - Why not that one? - I already know her. - All the more reason. - Then it wouldn't be luck. Seven. 237. Number 237 wins the sewing kit. - Number 237. - That's me. Look. - Lucie. Don't make a fuss. - But I've won. - Your dress. I've torn your dress. - It doesn't matter. Be quiet. - Is it serious? - A friend lent me this dress. But you've won a sewing kit. - What can we do for this young lady? - Nothing, thank you. - Bad luck. I'm gambling, he's winning. - And now... The next winner is mine. A cage and two birds, no doubt madly in love. Ladies, does the sight not fill you with emotion? - Agreed. Whoever wins the cage... - Wins my heart. - You like risk. - It's what I do best. - Zero. - Good start. - Keep calm. - I'd like to see you in my shoes. Number three. Who will be the lucky winner? Number four. Three and four. Number 34 wins a delightful birdcage. - I have Number 34. - Our dear president has Number 34. - The colonel's wife. - If you like risk... - I'm terribly sorry... - It's not your number? - I've got 54, I made a mistake. - I'm so sorry. Is the lucky winner not in the room? Number 34. I'll find her. Number 34. Number 34. Might you be the winner? - What's the prize? - A surprise. A last kiss will suffice As our farewell Those words of love... Thirty-four. Thirty-four. Number 34? - It's you? - I think so. - Do you think so or are you sure? - I'm almost sure. I am certain. - Don't say you've lost your ticket. - I don't know where I put it. - You must find it. - Is it so important? Everything governed by fate is important. Look carefully. You didn't give your ticket to anyone? - I came alone. - Alone? Don't waste any more of your time. Thank you. Wait. - In your glove? - In my glove. How did you guess? It was my last chance. You were about to leave. - What must I do now? - Nothing. I'll fetch your prize. Very well, then. Number 34. - And here's her glove. - Already? Fate has good taste. - I've never seen her before. - She arrived recently from Paris. - You are still agreed? - It's beginning to interest me. Me too. You undertake to obtain the favors of Mime Marie-Louise Riviere before the regiment leaves for summer manoeuvres. - Perfect. - Just one question. You have her name and her glove. The rest is up to you. I thought you didn't want to go out alone. Then I would never go out at all. - You changed your mind? - You too, I see. - I didn't want to come either but... - You were persuaded. Won't you join my sisters? They'd be glad to see you. - She's looking at us. - She's smiling. She's coming this way. - Good evening, Mr. Duverger. - Mlle. - You've met my fianc, I believe? - I've already congratulated him. - You know Mille Gervais? - Of course. Why don't you go home? My carriage will take you. - I don't feel like being alone. - I'll join you later. Here are the birds, so fortunate to be your prize. Thank you. You're lonely here. The provinces don't suit you. You mean I don't suit the provinces. Not yet. But trust me. Let me guide you. One day... What is your address, Mime? My orderly will deliver this tomorrow. - No need, sir. I will take care of it. - As you wish. You'll have your revenge on these hypocrites when we are together. - Why wait any longer? - Aren't you Mr. Duverger? - Indeed I am. - I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'm taking this to the new one. - The new what? - Fancy woman. - It's not true. You're making it up. - Shall I repeat it? - You'll forget me tomorrow. - I'll say it again tomorrow, every day. - Strange. It's as if I'm scared of you. - That's hard to believe. There's so much I want to say, yet I can't find the words. Another day, then. Good night. - Good night? - I have to leave. - Then let's go. - No, you stay here. We are in the provinces and everyone is watching us. They must see me leave alone. As I arrived. Madame. Just one word. What you said intrigues me. - Why must they see you leaving alone? - I thought you'd understood. I am a stranger here, from Paris. More importantly, I'm divorced. I see. You must beware what people say and protect your reputation. That's why I cannot be seen in the street at night... With a Dragoon. I should have known. I'm sorry, you're quite right. - Good night, Mme. - Good night. Wait. One thing. You're Parisian, divorced, and you're going into a hat shop. - I make hats. - You make hats. Parisian, divorced, a hat-maker, named Marie-Louise. - That's all I know. - You need know nothing more. I need know nothing more? Really? - I'm very tired. - Women say that to get rid of someone. You said it. Good night. - Here? - Good night. Let's see. Your name is Lucie, you live with your father, and this was your first ball. - Yes, Monsieur. - My name is Felix. - Until tomorrow. - No, Mr. Felix. Father says a young lady must never go out alone. - Never? - Until she's engaged. Then, good night, Mlle. Mille Lucie. - You said you'd be home early. - You'll never guess. - I led the cotillion. - You don't say. With a handsome officer. - Are you expecting someone? - Mr. Duverger. - At this hour? - He said he might come. Go to bed. I'll let him in. You have a lot to learn. She said goodbye, so you left. If I'm sent packing, I come right back. - Better late than never, Mme. - There was no hurry. It seems there is. Lieutenant's orders. Mustn't leave these by the door. - Here? There? - I'll take them up to my room. I hope I didn't disturb you, but orders are orders. In any case, I wish you good night. He hasn't had to wait long for this one. You need know nothing more. What did you mean? - How did you get in? - Never mind. - Leave at once. - If you don't explain, I shall repeat until dawn: "You need know nothing more". - It's quite clear. - Yes, but what does it mean? It means I have no time to waste. Nor have I. What are you waiting for? There's no lack of women in this town on whom your time would not be wasted. After tonight, there are no other women in this town. If you're in love, go down on one knee and make yourself ridiculous. I'm not afraid to be ridiculous. - Marie-Louise. - I know what you're going to say. Tonight has made a new man of you, you can't live without me. You haven't eaten for three hours, or slept for 10 minutes. - You see? I know your lines by heart. - Marie-Louise... Your declaration is over. You may get up and leave. - No. I'll wait. - What for? Your answer. You had me speak, I'll have you answer. If I were you, do you know what I'd say? I hardly know you and I'd like to be sure of your sincerity. - Let's sit down and talk. - No. Don't say a word, I'm speaking for you. I feel, this is you talking, that I have met a true friend. In this small town, where even respectable women fall prey to gossip, I have at last found someone who will keep secret whatever we might say or do. If you knew, Armand... My name is Armand. If you knew, Armand, how lonely I was before I met you... - Are you expecting someone? - Be quiet. Don't move. - Who's there? - It's me. Can't you see? I do believe I'm half asleep. The door's locked. Come and let me in. - It's rather late, don't you think? - I told you I'd come. - I'd given up on you. - I have to talk to you. Let me in. Someone will see you. - I hate lies. - You left me no other choice. - And I didn't lie to you. - Yes, you did. By telling me nothing. Mr. de la Verne. It's her you should be talking to, not me. I thought it best to leave. More effective, don't you think? If I'd been too insistent I might have ruined everything. It'll do her no harm to wait. - Good night. - Don't lose any sleep over it. Me? What do you take me for? She's not my first. - She's the one who's losing sleep. - So am I. I left with an angry gesture, that's very good. It makes an impression. First be firm, then be tender. And if tenderness doesn't work, use the whip. Training starts tomorrow. - That's right, tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Turn out the light. - I'm preoccupied. Sorry, I think I forgot to pick up her glove. A Parisian glove. It's obvious, don't you think? No. You really don't know a thing, do you? Look. - The cotillion was most amusing. - And that lieutenant was charming. - What is his name? - Victor? What's the name of the lieutenant who danced with Mime Riviere? - Lieutenant de la Verne. - She seemed to find it amusing too. - Who? - Mime la Riviere. She is coming to tea this afternoon. Who? Mime Riviere. - You don't believe me. - Of course I do. At breakfast this morning, they themselves said: - "Mime Riviere must come to tea today. " - How kind. - So I jumped at the chance. - Of course. I told you to trust me. Everything will be fine. - Madame. - What is it, Amelie? I'm late for church. If I close the door, will Mime let me in? Yes, just knock. - You bought some new cups. - Pretty, aren't they? - If you needed them, why not ask? - You know I don't like to. - We'll settle our accounts later. - Later, always later. - Later, later... - You're cheerful this morning. Why not? You tell me everything will be fine. - Are you expecting someone? - Nobody. I'll go and see. Dressed like that? I won't have it. It's not your job to open doors. Who would be so bold? You would show yourself at my window? What about my reputation? Stay here, please. - Who's there? - It's me. Can't you see? I do believe I'm half asleep. I had a dozen cups delivered to you this morning. - And a letter of apology. - You have nothing to apologize for. - Yes, I have. I'm coming up. - I'm sorry, I cannot receive you. There's a concert in the gardens this afternoon. - I shan't come. - I'll expect you. You're jealous. Bravo. Everything's going my way today. You're laughing. You don't want me to take him seriously? I want nothing. Go to the concert in the gardens. You are quite free. - Excuse us, Mme. - If you don't mind? - Mr. Duverger is not here? - I think he knows you're here. Victor? He's not in his study. Perhaps he's in his room. We're used to it. He often disappears for hours on end. Victor. This is too bad. - He invites her. - And we're stuck with her. - It was so sweet of you to come. - We didn't want to be alone with her. - We don't know what to say to her. - We can play some music. My dear lady, I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd be... - Are you alone? - I'm used to it. This is most embarrassing. Jeanne. Juliette. - Don't you know Mime Riviere is here? - Yes, we saw her. It's unthinkable. My respects, Mme. Are you doing it on purpose? We didn't know she was alone. Quickly, quickly. We thought you'd be here to receive her. - They pose in this studio. - Then let's pose. - You take pictures? - Papa. I'm not allowed. - Then you'll pose with me. - Let me go. What if someone comes. Ready? Hold still. - You moved, we'll have to do it again. - If you come near me, I'll leave. Here is my father, Monsieur, if you'd like to wait a moment. What fun when I'm around! Like the florist selling flowers Like the grocer selling butter I produce laughter What fun we're having! What fun when I'm around! On my way to get wed The mayor laughed at me Now you know why I'm still single What fun we're having What fun when I'm around! - Should we risk it? - Let's risk it. - No, I fear we must postpone. - Yes, let's postpone. No, go back. This is the moment. Let's make the most of it. Ready? Hold still. - Shall I call you a carriage? - No, stay here. - The first meeting went well. - Very well. - Very well, wouldn't you say? - Let's not talk about it here. You're right. Goodbye. Goodbye. Juliette. Quickly, come and see. - Too good to be true. - He's heaven sent. - How sad she looks. - Maybe she needs consoling. Too late, here comes her consolation. - It's la Verne. - As if by chance. - What's he waiting for? - Now's the time, go on. That's it, walk past her, turn, and what a lovely surprise. - Good day, Madame. - Good day, Monsieur. - What? He's letting her go? - No love left, la Verne? No. He's going the same way. How very convenient. Allow me, Madame. - He danced with her all night. - They're still together this morning. - Like a fairy-tale. - With a predictable ending. - I'm sure he'll kiss her. - What he's waiting for? - Maybe she won't. - So why come here? - To walk. - With a Dragoon? - You'll see. He's holding her hand. - That's progress. And now he'll hold her round the waist. - No, she's moved away. - Some men don't have the knack. - You're not dancing? - We're not here to have fun. Am I allowed to sit next to you? No, I haven't forgotten my promises. I don't find you pretty, I'm not in love with you. In short, a good day. At last, you laughed. I told you, you need a confidant. A true friend. But I don't know you yet. Give me your hand. If I were wooing you, I would raise this hand to my lips. And you'd be angry, wouldn't you? Don't be angry. May I? - You're a palm-reader? - Don't tell anyone. It's my secret. I'm an expert, believe me. One glance is enough. - Is it the beginnings of true love? - Can't you see? Here is the first meeting. Here's the first kiss. Here... - And then? - And then... Will I have lots of children? Better than reading your palm would be to read your mind in your eyes. - I can do that too. - Then look into my eyes. Closer. If you come too close, I can't see anything. You don't want to see. You don't want to understand. In truth, I don't understand myself. It's the first time I've had such feelings for a woman. I wish only to gain her friendship, to be worthy of her trust. Marie-Louise, I'm out of luck. You refuse to believe me. Lieutenant Leroy. With champagne. - You were expecting me. - No. - May I come in? - Can't you see I'm not alone? I see, I see. Please excuse me. - I just wondered if there was any news. - About what? - Last night. The lady at the ball. - I don't know what you mean. There's no mystery. Everyone's talking about Armand and his new conquest. Good evening, la Verne. What a lovely surprise. I didn't see you. Ladies and gentlemen, the champagne awaits. You heard. The champagne awaits. Drink to your conquests, everyone's talking about them. With your permission, we will drink to love. - And those who aren't afraid of love. - Or lies. - Or happiness. - It's true, you're out of luck. I will never be able to believe you. What does it mean, "26 days left". In 26 days, we leave for summer manoeuvres. - The night before, we'll have a feast. - And we won't be paying. - Will we, Armand? - But who's the woman? - Who is it? - The name? The name. The name. If he won't say, he must already have won. What should I do with these? She doesn't want them either. - Disaster. - It's a rout. - Never say die. - Ungrateful wretch. - Is your heart made of stone? - How can you resist? - What would you do if you were me? - I'd learn to play billiards. I'm not talking about billiards. You won't believe it, but with her I haven't got the knack. - It's serious, then? - No, but I need the right tactic. - I'd go full steam ahead. - Not with her. On the contrary, I think I should proceed with care. Great care. - I said I was going to the theatre. - Really? They both exclaimed: "But you don't like music". Do you know what I said? "The person I'm going with likes it. " - Did they ask who that person was? - I didn't say. But they knew. - You'll need 20 bottles of champagne. - Why? For the dinner you'll soon be treating us to. She gave us such a look. She's his mistress. - It's written all over her face. - I need proof. - She won't tell you. - I will know. When I see her, she's never alone. - And when she's alone? - She won't see me. - I didn't know you were so timid. - Nor did I. They said: "It seems Mime Riviere will be at the colonel's ball". I looked them in the eye and said: "I obtained her invitation". And do you know what they said? "What a good idea. " - Mime, we'll rescue you. - Don't let him corner you. - Victor is selfish. - As punishment, he'll dance with me. - Look, she's given him the slip. - But the sister's taken over. - I'll do my duty. - You'd do that for me? I will ask the sister to dance. Mademoiselle... Standing in a corner at the ball? You should be ashamed. Mr. Leroy, dance with me, please. Mr. de la Verne, I thought you knew Mime Riviere? - What are you waiting for? - I'd never be so bold. One must always be bold. - I beg you, let me go. - I've waited too long for this moment. - We've only known each other a week. - This week has lasted a lifetime. What if someone comes and sees me in your arms? Everyone would know what you refuse to believe. Everyone would think I love you too. Leave, then. What are you waiting for? You're free. No, I'm not. Even if you let go of my hand. That's why I can't see you again. I want to flee from you too, yet I come back to you. Meet me once more tomorrow. Just once. - That's all I ask. - What's the use? Tomorrow, on the corner of your street. I'll be there at nightfall. Not that way. You're heading in the wrong direction. Maybe. I like going straight ahead. Some obstacles cannot be overcome. In such cases, one takes a different route. - This is no joke. - I'm just as serious as you are. You know exactly what I'm talking about. I dare you to say it. I advise you to give up your pursuit of the lady who was here a moment ago. A brother or a husband might give such advice. As far as I know, you are neither one nor the other. Mr. de la Verne. - What's missing? - Something like a duck's beak. This? "Monnet... My dear Monnet. " A letter to Monnet. - Here's your duck's beak. - A question of honor. - A question of honor. - A duel. Alice was very upset. If we hadn't been there... - They really quarreled? - She thought they would come to blows. - Just before my wedding. - And Mr. Duverger's your witness. - Six months, you say. - At least six months to handle a sword. - And these young men? - Three years at most. Beginners. But take a skilled blade, such as Lieutenant de la Verne... - Lieutenant de la Verne... - He's a champion. - Very well, I'll think about it. - Touch. So I said: "Are you her brother or her husband?" - What could he say? - I know how I would have replied. - How? - Like this. - That wouldn't have hurt much. - But how will it all end? - What do you want me to do? Kill him? - He might kill you. If he shoots like you, I'm in no danger. - You think that's funny? - I'm just happy, that's all. - I'm seeing her tonight. - You think she'll come? This time, I'm sure. - Give me that. - I know you're a good shot. It's not that, it's to predict the future. I want to know if I'll succeed. What do you think? I think you're wrong. - About Marie-Louise? - Risking scandal to win a dinner? The wager? I don't give a fig. - So? - So, don't you understand? Are you in love with her? Are you capable of loving a woman? You amaze me. So do you. Yes, Colonel, one of your officers. Yes, Lieutenant de la Verne. He knows all about it. Yes... Goodbye. You can rely on me. Tell the barracks I wish to see Mr. de la Verne. Thank you, Colonel. Champagne. It looks rather decadent, don't you think? - Just what you need. - What would you know? Tell me, champagne. Don't you think it's a bit out of place? When a woman comes to your rooms... If it was just any woman, but her... I don't know... If you don't know, how should I? No, no champagne. - Shall I take it back? - Yes. No, leave it here. Flowers. I wonder if flowers... - Oh, flowers, yes. - Flowers, yes. Gloves. Hers mustn't lie next to the others. These gloves, I'll leave them with you. - What the devil for? - You can burn them if you like. Do it yourself. And get out of my sight. You understand, then? At nightfall, light the candles. No electricity. Take a last look around. Heavens above. The letters. All these letters must be burnt. - It'll make smoke. - That's true. We don't want smoke. What shall we do? Take this to Lieutenant Leroy. I am perfectly serious. We're leaving for Paris this afternoon. If you must go to Paris, go on your own. - A change of scenery would do you good. - I've never felt so well. Life in the provinces is so dull. We have to have fun now and again. We were out dancing again last night. Aren't you bored of the same old faces? But think, we can't leave on a journey together. - Why not? - Everyone would know. As if I care. - What would people say? - I don't give a fig what people say. - Good day, Monsieur. - Goodbye, Madame. - Can I expect your answer today? - There's no hurry. - We'll discuss the matter again. - I'll be in my office all day. - Enough of your jokes, understood? - Yes, sir. - Refrain from provoking Mr. Duverger. - Yes, sir. Mr. Duverger's an imbecile, but I forbid you to interfere in his affairs. Do you give me your word you won't see Mime Riviere again? - No, sir. - I beg your pardon? Think about it, la Verne. You cannot, for the sake of a woman... Hello? Yes? Yes. Who? Yes, it's me. You're so kind. No, my sweet, I haven't forgotten you. You promised to come and hear me sing one night. An officer's word is his bond. But I'll hide you, in a little corner. In a little corner? Yes, yes, all right. See you soon. - Where was I? - For the sake of a woman. Yes. Have you thought about it? I haven't changed my mind. You haven't thought about it enough. I'll give you more time. A detachment leaves within the hour to set up staging-posts. You will command it. Two weeks in the country will change your outlook. And I'll get some peace in the meantime. I'll hear no more of you, of Mr. Duverger, his sister, the police chief, his daughter, his wife, my wife. You called, my dear? - Good evening, Mme. - Good evening. - Do you have a finer veil? - I'll show you, Mme. I can only stay a moment. Forgive me. My men are waiting for me. I have to leave, the colonel's orders. I couldn't pass your door without saying farewell. - You're leaving? - A few days. A week or two. A week or two. Goodbye. I wanted to tell you... I don't know... How well he played his part. Awkward, shy. He was perfect. Anyone listening would swear he's in love with you. She returns with heart a-flutter When the betrothed Returns with heart a-flutter When the betrothed awaits you Quiet, Antoine. The music's spoiling Mr. Chartier's conversation. Carry on, you're not bothering me. Our friend la Verne, had he won before he left? If anyone asks, it's a secret. - What secret? - If you don't reply, he must have lost. - It's unfair. We should cancel the bet. - What bet? - That's not for little girls to know. - May we go on? Farewell, go! Nothing binds us... ONLY 14 DAYS LEF For you those words no longer have meaning I know it too well But nonetheless I could believe In your "always" In your "never" If you loved me Shall we go? She must like that song, she's come twice to hear it. - It brings back memories. - Our friend la Verne. La Verne? Poor woman. His campaign was in full swing when he left. - He'll renew his attack. - For sure. I know his tricks. He says: "Forever". He says: "Never". Look at the weather. I'll find a hackney cab. I can see him now. Madame, I will be your confidant, a true friend, a brother. Call me Armand. Have I ever loved? I thought I loved, but my heart is pure. I have waited too long for this moment. Permit me to keep a memento of this evening. If not your hand, then give me your glove. He must have dozens of them. - And the palm-reading? He did mine. - I don't know you. Give me your hand. Look at me straight in the eye. Closer. Never saw a better performance. And I'm a professional. It's the first time I've had such feelings for a woman. I would flee from you yet I come back to you. See me again tomorrow. Just once more. It's all I ask. - Well? Is your gentlemen coming back? - Perhaps we could offer you a drink? Next time, sir, would you mind staying out of the rain? See to my horse first. - Why do you gallop around like that? - To change my outlook. Delivery of letters for the barracks. - They say he'll be back tomorrow. - So he'll have two days left. - What can he do in two days? - Out of sight, out of mind. - Who's it for? - The police chief's daughter. Alice? I've fallen out with her, over Felix. I mean Lieutenant Leroy. - Alice and Felix... - Felix is friends with Armand. And Alice and Armand, not very long ago... I'm so sorry. - Alice and Armand was before... - Before? Armand and you. What are you thinking? Armand and me? I thought... - Were they serious, Alice and Armand? - He said he'd marry her. - Well, these young officers. - Yes, young officers. But Felix is a young officer, too. That hat suits you perfectly. - I prefer this one. - If it was down to me... Tell me... Did he never talk about it? - Who? - Armand. - About marrying me? - No. I mean, did he never talk about Felix and me? We've hardly seen each other, he hasn't had time. - Do you think Felix plans to marry? - I have no idea. You don't believe it. You don't believe it either. - He said he loved me. - If you believe what men say... - They're not all the same. - So we think. - He said he'd never loved before? - How do you know? - He'd waited for you? - Yes. Did he say: "I would flee you yet I cannot"? - No, not that. - One day, he will. - But you mustn't believe it. - I know why you say that. - Because Armand is making fun of you. - How do you know Felix isn't too? - He's not wooing me to win a wager. - You think he'll marry you? Good morning. Have you heard the news? Armand is here. A day early. - Hello, Lucie. - Go away. - What's wrong? - I won't see you. - What have I done, Mime? - Wait outside a moment. Lucie will be out directly. - I'm sorry, Lucie. - So am I. Why did you mention a wager? What's happening? Lieutenant Leroy is chasing Mille Lucie. - "O, tyrant Love. When held by you... " - Remember what you promised. If you come near me, I'll leave. At least take off your veil, so I can look at you. Go and make the tea. I came here for tea, don't forget. - Come along. - You're right. Tea first. Who's this lady on the mantelpiece? - A cousin. - You have lots of cousins. - Feel free to take a look. - A large family, I suspect. To think your cousins could read my letters if I was ever foolish enough to write. I'm discreet. I always burn letters. - I'm sure that if I had a look... - I keep no secrets from you. What a mess. Bills, rent receipts... A letter. Not to worry, it's from a man. - And what's this? - An interesting discovery? No... Shameful. Disgraceful. Unspeakable. ".. undertakes to obtain the favors... " The favors.. ".. of Mime Marie-Louise Riviere. " - To write such a thing. - Let's not be mean. - It's not to say de la Verne succeeded. - It's not to say he didn't. How did you come by this vile document? By chance. Don't mind me. I'm just passing through. - You're going out? - To take some air. Enjoy your walk. Good evening. - It's the same every evening. - "O, tyrant Love. When held by you... " You're being childish. Two weeks ago I asked you to come to Paris and you refused. - Now you want to leave for no reason. - There is a reason. He's coming back. I would have preferred not to ask you any questions. But you force me to do so. - What happened between you? - Nothing. Nothing to stop me looking you in the eye. - Nothing to stop you becoming my wife? - Whenever you like. But take me away. Let's leave tonight, tomorrow, as soon as you can. - We can't leave now. - Why not? - What are you thinking? The wedding. - What wedding? The police chief's daughter is marrying tomorrow. - What does it matter? - I'm Alice's witness. The police chief himself has invited you to the reception. - It's very important. - Then I'll leave on my own. You cannot simply fly in the face of good manners. In time, these people will become our friends. Think of the future. Don't go to the door. Do you think it's him? - I cannot see him. - You won't have to. You've come to see Mime Riviere? She won't see you. If she tells me herself, I will believe it. - Is it your job to guard her door? - Yes, and you will not enter. Have you the right to enter her house at all hours? I have no right. But no one, not even she, can stop me loving her. You love her? Without self-interest? And she must sacrifice everything to be a cavalry officer's mistress? You'd rather she sacrificed everything to your self-interest? My self-interest includes trying to make her happy. I'm going to marry her. You have nothing more to fear. Good evening, sir. That was quick work. You've only just got back. She's waited two weeks to see me, sir. - She's brave. - More than you think, sir. We've decided to get married. You're a smart one. Couldn't you think of anything better? Where is Lucie? She wouldn't listen. She ran from me as if... She almost threw herself under a cab, if I hadn't been... - But you were there. - I love her. And all you could think of was to ask for her hand? You fool. - I'm seeing her father tomorrow. - Marriage. It's an epidemic. You've no more heart than a lump of glass. They will say "Lieutenant Leroy, future general, is marrying who?" - "The photographer's daughter. " - They'll only say it once. I thought she was just a bit of fun. - She's a young lady. - How do you know? - You've gone too far. - I'll go further. Better a photographer's daughter than a kept woman. - Who? - Duverger's fancy woman. You'll be sorry. - This is serious. - What's this? - Separate them. - You'll be my seconds. - Be reasonable. - We will fight. As if I would fight you. - Get me a brandy. - Don't drink. - You're usually so calm. - This evening, I'm not. - Well, calm down. - And settle this right now. - Felix is your best friend. - Who started it? - I did. - So you must apologize. Tomorrow morning at dawn. Pistols. Go and tell him. - We can settle this. - I want no settlement. - But if he apologizes? - Let's find him. - Felix, we both acted like schoolboys. - Both of us? - I'm not the only one at fault. - Then you might as well leave. - In that case... - That's no apology. I'm not going down on my knees. I ordered brandy. Apologize properly, la Verne. One glass of brandy. - Did you hear those two? - Officers are forbidden to duel. If they want to fight, they won't ask permission. Sir, I have the honor of presenting my most sincere apologies. I admit my wrongs... I admit my wrongs... And I humbly beg your forgiveness. - I beg your forgiveness. - "Humbly beg". - We're not fighting over one word. - If Mr. Leroy insists on that word... He's stubborn, you must admit. I admit my wrongs and I beg... And I beg nothing at all. You can go to the devil. If you want a duel, I'm your man. One duel or a dozen, no matter. I'm risking my rank. Now's your chance, you can all sign up. Until tomorrow. - Come, come, la Verne... - Have you gone mad? Perhaps I have. - He could have gone to a tailor. - Careful mending. Open 24-hours. Here you are. It's not perfectly finished, but for getting you home, it will do. You've had enough to drink. And to think I was counting the days. - I came back too soon. - But we're glad to see you. You must be the only one. Are you very sad? Is she pretty? Does she love you? Is she married? She's getting married. Not to you? Why? Why not? You're leaving already? I won't see you again? I may come back. When I need some advice. "Signed: Armand de la Verne. " "Witnessed by: Rose-Mousse... " "Ciboulette... " - "Nini la Rousse. " - Your fiance is in good company. Here, read it yourself if you don't believe me. - What does it prove? - Nothing. Any rogue can write filth about a respectable woman. - They wouldn't write that about us. - You're the town's laughing stock. Show it to your beloved, and see what she has to say. - No need. - You wouldn't dare. - I know the wretch didn't win his bet. - He knows. Do you think she'd tell you otherwise? Silence. That's enough. I knew you'd come back. I didn't know myself. - I was waiting for you. - To tell me your good news? To beg you to forget me. I tried my best all evening but here I am at your door. - We must finish this, Armand. - It's finished. I'm leaving, on summer manoeuvres, and when I come back... - You will have forgotten about me. - You'll be married. Yes. To someone you're not in love with. He loves me. What about me? I've waited for days for a reply to my letters. I ran to you the minute I got back. What game is this? Why are you punishing me? What have I done? Nothing. But if I listen to you any longer, all will be lost. I'm afraid of you. You know that I love you. Yes, in your own way. As far as you are able. For a few weeks, a few days. For my whole life. How many women have heard that promise? No. I don't remember ever saying that. - Each one that heard it remembers. - But I'm not lying to you. You've said that, too. Then what must I do? Leave, I beg you, and don't try to see me again. And if I asked you... If I asked you to be my wife? Go home. You don't know what you're saying. Armand. Please note that Mr. de la Verne, having been shot at three times, humbly begs his opponent's forgiveness. - You should be ashamed. - What's the matter? You got your duel. When I'm dead, you make a fuss. When I'm alive, you complain. Make up your mind. One of them fired three times. On the third shot... The other one fell. - Who was it? - We don't know. If he's dead, his name will be in the newspaper. I'm sure I recognized Mr. de la Verne and Mr. Leroy. Listen to me. - You didn't want me to kill you? - You could have shot at me once. - But I wouldn't have missed. - I'd have preferred it that way. Playing dead. Idiot. Making a fool of me in front of my fellow officers. How's it going to make me look? - Three misses. I'll be a joke. - No one will find out. What you said about my fiance. Did you mean it? Of course not. I was talking nonsense yesterday. I was a bit upset. Marie-Louise? Yes. - It's starting to get serious, then? - It's not starting. It's over. - Definitely Leroy and de la Verne? - They quarreled yesterday. - And one of them is dead? - So they say. Be off with you. And mind your tongue. - What a business. - Fighting is what soldiers do. - On Miles wedding day. - We mustn't mention it. No, we mustn't mention it, especially not to Mlle. Nearly done? We have to leave in two minutes. - So? Which one of them is dead? - We don't know. - If it was Mr. de la Verne. - No one must mention it. On the very day of the wedding. - You said nothing to Mille Alice? - What about? About the duel. - You didn't know? Don't mention it. - What are you talking about? - Two officers fought... - Who? Mr. Leroy and Mr. de la Verne. They say there was an accident. If Mille Alice knew about it... - Please, Mr. Duverger. - I beg you, sir. - You are the bride's witness. - As you represent the law. My respects, Mme. Armand. - Claude. - Alice. Victor. Couldn't you have stayed until the end? Where did you go? - I was here. - All afternoon? - Yes, if you must know. - Well, well. Will you dine with us? - I don't know what I'm doing. - You said it. - Good evening. - You're going out? Would you like to change the ribbons? What if we put flowers on it instead? No, not flowers. Autumn's on its way. Maybe some fruit? Fruit? If you wish. Mr. Duverger. Lovely wedding, wasn't it? But fruit, once winter's here? Maybe flowers instead. I'll think about it. - You know that I've tried to see you? - Yes, I know. You left the church without a word. - You'd heard talk of a duel? - Yes. There was no duel. No doubt it was another of Mr. de la Verne's jokes. And it's because of him that you're crying. It's because of you. You're my only friend and I'm going to lose you. You won't lose me. I can still protect you from yourself. It's too late. You loved him that much? And you believe that he loves you? Yes. Then I have no right to remain silent. You should know why you've sacrificed our happiness. - Please go, I beg you. - I will go. You'll never see me again. I've been a coward. I waited and hesitated for too long. But it would be too cowardly to remain silent now. Say what you like, but let's get it over. - Mr. de la Verne never loved you. - Believe that if you wish. - He wanted to win a wager. - It's not true. You're the object of a wager and the prize is an officers' dinner. All the town will know it soon enough. The night before they go on manoeuvres. This very night, your name will be taken in vain by a table of young men. You're lying. You're just like everyone else... Is it proof that you want? Read this. Mime Riviere, I've been thinking. I'm not sure that flowers... Perhaps you're busy. Should I come back another day? - Yes, Mme. - Mr. Duverger? Another day. Come back another day. And you, Mime Monnet. - This is none of your business. - My husband will hear of this. He should hear of other matters which would interest him more. Marie-Louise, forgive me. Did you fight a duel? - Yes, sir. - No, sir. - Did you go to the dueling ground? - Yes, sir. - So one of you is lying? - No, sir. Enough. Leave us, Leroy. No sooner do you come back than a new scandal erupts. You will remain under house arrest until it's time to leave tomorrow. - Olivier. - Colonel, may I say... - This evening... - You will stay in your rooms. You're getting off lightly. - What is it? - You shouldn't be so hard on him. - That's my business. - Mine too. - People will say you're jealous of him. - Jealous? Why? Don't pretend. You were spotted at the cafe-concert. - And so? - With that singer. Confound you, woman. So sorry, my dear. I'm busy. La Verne, I'm prepared to be lenient once more. - I'm lifting your house arrest. - Thank you, sir. What are you doing that's so important? Nothing. Just a dinner party. - Quiet. - He's going to tell us. - The time has come. - Bring us the bill. - It's the only way to get the truth. - Armand, who's paying? - You are all my guests. - Which means you've lost. - He didn't say so. - Maybe he's won. - He's won. - He's lost. Let him speak. The man who accepted this wager a month ago no longer exists. I'm paying his debts. - He's becoming serious. - He's changed. - He's a monk. - Tell us all. - Battle stories. - We want to know. - Details. - A full confession. I have only one confession to make. Thanks to this wager, I've met the first and only love of my life. - Bravo. - Three cheers. - And now, the lady's name. - The name. The name. I'll tell you. I'll tell you the name she will soon bear. Mine. We've just been had. - What a joker. - Maybe he's serious. - Great news, Mathilde. - Mr. de la Verne is getting married. - Did he say so? - Just this minute. Then he's not getting married. You can't take him seriously. - Where's he going? - What is it? - A lady's waiting for him in a cab. - A lady? - Another one. - Let's go and find her. Marie-Louise, my love. Armand. Don't forget about us. What are you doing here? You wanted to see me again? One last time. I so wanted to see you again, too I can't believe my happiness. And you? I can't believe it either. - Armand. - Lieutenant de la Verne. - Hurry up. - Don't forget we're leaving tomorrow. - Can you hear them? - Yes. Fellow officers. You were dining with them, the night before you go on manoeuvres? They're just having fun. - Because I'm here with you? - They don't know who you are. - You haven't told them yet? - Never. - I'm sure you spoke to them about me. - But without naming you. - You see? - I told them: "The woman I love is the only love of my life. " - And they believed it? - Yes. You seem to doubt me. Why? Why? - That's enough. - Come back, you'll find another. Tell me. Let me look into your eyes. - You're hiding something from me. - And you? Look into my eyes. Remember when you told me you could... Read minds? But not yours. In your "always" In your "never" Not that song. Be quiet. Go back to them. Go and have fun with them. There's nothing more to say. Nothing more? Are you quite sure? Everything that you could say I know already. No, you don't know everything. Mr. de la Verne. Your friends say the lady should come and drink some champagne. Drive on. Tomorrow, when the regiment marches through the town, open your window. I will leave knowing you forgive me, that I haven't lost you.
