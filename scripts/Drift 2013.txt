There'll be no green bottles standing on the wall 10 blue bottles standing on the wall... Ah, look at that. Oi, Jimmy! Come back here. Goofy, get back here! Can you go get your brother, please? Nuh-uh. No way, kiddo. I've got a job interview in Albany and it's still a day's drive away. Albany's gonna suck. And it's not going to have waves like that. You could find a job here easy. Andrew, I'm not going to ask you again. Come on, it's a sign. We'll fit right in. I promise. Aww! - Big boy, let's go! Hit him! - Say it again, I dare you! I'm all ears, mate. Got anything else you want to add? Come on, Lincoln! Nah, I didn't think so. Go on then, piss off back to Sydney dickhead. Awww! Boys, break it up! You lads break it up! Get off of him! God! Nothin' but trouble, you lot. I'll be back in an hour. Don't even think about going anywhere. We'll talk about this then. Feel like a quick wave? Deep down in Louisiana close to new Orleans way back up in the woods among the evergreens there stood a log cabin made of earth and wood where lived a country boy... Hey there. I'm Gus. Jimmy Kelly. How's it goin', fellas? It's a bit nippy, eh? Be warmer back on land, mate. Go, Johnny, go go... Guess I'll see you when I see you. Oi, wait your turn! Johnny b. Goode... He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack go sit beneath the tree... Whoo! Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made people passing by, they would stop and say "oh my, that little country boy could play..." Wow. Hello, Mr. fix-it. Oh, just basic patching, glassing. Caravans and canoes and stuff. The nearest ding-fixer's in perth, so I do most of the locals' boards as well. Cool. Really? Yeah. It's unreal. Sweet. All right, let's take a look at ya. The nose section's pretty stuffed. I can try and bog her up, but I'm not too sure how good she'll turn out. Why don't we just chop it off? He did. Yeah, genius. That's dick brewer. Bloke's a legend. Probably has dozens of boards. - So? - So we've only got the one. What if we stuff it up? I'm already in a enough shit with mom. Couldn't make it any worse. Sorta makes sense. Less surface area, less drag. Your board, but. Whoa! Pointing it the right way? Ya little mullet. No, Jim, no no no no, not that one. Jim! Jimmy! Whoo! Whoo! And for the first time in the history of the comp',... ...we've scored ourselves a sponsor! Which means finally someone else gets the privilege... ...of putting on the keg. And that someone is Mr. ocean king himself, Gordon king! - Over to you, gordo. - All right. Thanks, Ron. Look, ocean king are stoked to be here,... ...supporting surfing at a grassroots level in Western Australia. By now you've all seen candy wandering around. Where are you, darlin'? Now come on, come over here. Right? Ha ha ha! Look at that, eh? If you're nice to her, she might even give you... ...a free stick of ocean king surfboard wax. I'll give her a stick! Yeah, right on, mate. Back in your box. I can tell we all want to have a beer, so let's get on with it. Okay, the winner of the 1972 ocean king... ...seacliffe amateur surf comp'... ...on what I am told is his trademark red rocket,... ...it's Jimmy Kelly! Come up here, son! You got it! Ah, shit! - Oh! - Whoo! - Yeah! - Speech! Speech! Well... - Let's get pissed! - Yeah! Ah, slow down a bit, mate. Anyone'd think you got somewhere else to go. Yeah, wind's going off-shore, Percy. Be clean as a whistle out there right now. I knock this one off, I'll get half an hour in the water... ...before the sharks come out and eat me. Rather you than me, mate. Come on, Percy! Chop chop! You old bag of bones! You're not done yet, mate. Hang in there, Andy. You won't have to carry the old bugger for much longer. He's been carrying me long enough, Stan. He probably deserves a bit of a breather by now, don't you reckon? Aw, you're a soft touch. Plenty of time for that when he's not on the clock. - Right, Percy? - Oh, right as rain, Stan. About bloody time. You were supposed to be here this morning! You blokes don't mind working back to unload it, do you? Hey, Jimmy! Ah. Hey, ladies. - How you doin'? - Nice car. Ah, thanks. Nice bike. - Hey, you. Goofy, you smelly old bastard, mate. Jesus, I thought my day sucked. I'm just finishing up. So? How'd he go? I thought we were going to fix mom's car? Oh, shit, I totally forgot. - I'm meeting the boys for a drink. - Which boys? I don't know, just the usual. How was your day? Long. You're really not going to ask how it went. How what went? Dickhead! - Mom told you, didn't she? - She couldn't help herself, mate. - Ahh! Jimmy Kelly! - Whooo! How good is that, mate? Now you make it to the nationals, I'm going to ask Stan for the day off. - How's that? - Yeah, right. I'll believe that when I see it. I'll fix the car on the weekend. I promise. Fuckin' hell. Whoa, thought it was a nightmare lo, it's all so true they told me, "don't go walkin' slow the devil's on the loose" better run through the jungle better run through the jungle better run through the jungle whoa, don't look back to see... You boys know the fine for pilfering another man's crayfish? It's 10 bucks... Per cray. How many you got? That's 20 bucks right there, mate. Honestly, we're really sorry, mate. Yeah, well, you will be if the owner ever catches you. I can't believe you get away with living like this. Who's gonna stop me? I don't know. Movin' around all the time... ...taking surf photographs,... ...not knowing where you're gonna be one day to the next? Doesn't seem like a job, right? It's not. It's not a job. Look, I surf and I get to document it. If some idiot wants to put diesel in my bus... ...and buy me a plane ticket, sweet, but it's not a job. Hey. Just don't tell anyone. G'day. - Hey. - Where'd you come from? I was surfing that little left-hander off the point. What's that called again? - Um, lefties. - Of course. So let me guess. What, Southern California, right? Malibu? Hawaii, west coast of oahu. So what happened? You get sick of warm water and perfect waves? - Something like that. - Huh. How long you and your boyfriend in town for? J.B.'S not my boyfriend. He's my dad's friend. Uh, dad wasn't too stoked with the boys... I was hanging out with on the island,... ...so he asked j.B. If I could tag along for a few months. Figured it might straighten me out. What, he actually thought hanging with j.B. Might straighten you out? - Should have seen the other boys. - Which other boys? Jimmy Kelly. Hey, I'm lani. - Yes, you are. - Oh. Look, I don't know how long you guys are around for,... ...but if you ever want to check out some of the local breaks, I'd be happy to show youse around. - Sounds good. Thanks. - And once you've done the tourist trap, I'll show you a few spots even he doesn't know about. Is that right, superstar? Yeah, well, I'd take you too, mate,... ...but it's a bit heavy for beginners. Oh, turn it up, mate. There you go-- it does work. Okay, uh, there you go. Thanks, man. - These all yours? - Yeah. Shit. Where haven't you surfed? Grajagan's. It's a real fast left-hander. Sucks real dry, bowls you real big. Yeah, only a handful have ever surfed there. Yeah, some American cat-- he found it. Don't know how, 'cause it's right there... ...in the jungles of Indonesia. Filled with scorpions, tigers, monkeys,... ...other crazy shit. Wow, sounds like a total mission just to get there. Yeah, well, the best ones usually are, mate. That's the trip right there, man. If God surfed, that would be his home break. That is exactly what she was wearing, man. Yeah, from the sounds of her, I'm surprised you even noticed. Nice one, Gus. "With sculptured arms for paddling,... ...velcro neck and snap fasteners for the cold,... ...it's just for surfers." That's just for millionaire surfers, more like it. Who's got 60 bucks lying around? We'll be dead and buried by the time it makes it down here. Who cares? - Hey, mom? - I'm not here. Got a sec? Hey! Hey! Check it out! It's rubberman! Jeez, aren't you embarrassed? No. Why should I be? He was talking to your board, mate. Hey, boys. Great swell, boys. You're not going in? Yeah, it's bloody cold, eh? - Yeah. - Freezing, isn't it? Brrr! Yeah. Yeah. Hey! Hey! Fair go. Turn that thing off, put your feet up, mom. Nearly done. "Mark 2." What do you think? I might struggle to squeeze into it. Mick Harris saw Jimmy's one and asked if we'd make one for his son. Well, tell him to make his own wetsuit. Said he'd pay $15. - 15 bucks. - Mm-hmm. Well, what are you waiting for? Sew, woman! You in there, jimbo? Jimmy, let's fix this car. What the hell? Haven't seen Jimmy, have you, Ron? Yeah, he was here a couple hours ago. Said he was headed home. Everything all right? Yeah. Yeah, sweet as. Ah, Jesus! Get back here! Stop! What are you doing?! - What the fuck are you doing? - Andy. - Give me a hand, quick! - Fuck! Thanks, man. You stay away from my fuckin' brother. Open this bloody door! Here! Police! You got to take it all back,... ...leave it outside the cop shop with a little note... ...saying who it belonged to. Yeah, right. Do it or don't bother coming back. Percy started working for my father straight out of school,... - ...and that was 1920...? - Two. '22. Since then, well, he's become part of the fabric of the place. So in honor of 50 years of hard work and dedication, I'd like to present him with a small token of our appreciation. - Well done, Perce. - All right! Speech! Give us a speech, Perce. Thanks. - Good on ya. - Yay! Love you, mate. Well, that's it, gentlemen. Back to work. Thank you. Mrs. Kelly, you look absolutely fantastic. I wish my mom dressed like you. Oh, thanks. You want some more salad? Yeah. Good size flatty. I'm surprised you had time to go fishing, considering your busy schedule. Had to go into town, drop a bunch of stuff off. Caught 'em after that. - Howdy, Gus. - Yeah, hi, Andy. - How you goin'? - Yeah, good. - What's the occasion? - Mr. O'Reilly offered me a promotion, didn't he? Hey, nice one, mate. - That's unreal. - Yeah. More bucks, more hours-- the whole nine yards. Aw, that's fantastic, love. When do you start? Well, I don't. I told him to shove it. It's all right. I've got another plan. Is it legal? Yup. It's been staring us in the face the whole time-- ...the whole bloody time. Rockin' and rollin', you're still doing it now 15 years today and you remember how you're gonna hear it now blastin' out your radio... Look at this, will you? - It's a well-oiled machine. - Hardly. Any luck? Not yet. Look on the bright side-- ...at least we won't have to buy surf gear ever again. Hmm! - How you goin', Greg? - All right. - What do you reckon? - Bit short, aren't they? That's the idea. That's what they're doing back east. - Yeah? - Yeah, she's a 6'8"-- perfect for a bloke your size. - How much? - Aw, 35. Call it an even 50 with the wetsuit. Look, mate, you don't like it, I'll give you your money back, no questions asked. And you can keep the wettie. - You're cocky, aren't you? - I've ridden it. All right, you're on. Good man. I'll give you a hand. Looks like we just beat the rush. - How are ya? - Hey, how are ya? - He's a natural. - Pleasure doing business. - Thanks. - See ya. See ya. - See you later, boys. - See ya, Jim. Man, you can talk. Lookin' good, Gus! Yeah. - - Be right out. Aloha. Oh, hey. How's it going? You settling in okay? You know, just getting my bearings. What, all two streets? - You in the market for a new stick? - Maybe. I really just came to see Jimmy's set-up, see what all the hype's about. Jimmy's set-up? Is that right? C'mon, mate. I am head shaper. Well, you're the only shaper, dickhead. I get him to put the bins out, sweep up, that kind of thing. - Keeps him off the streets. - Don't worry about him. - Reckons he taught me everything I know. - I did, mate. Just not everything I know. Big difference. Uh, we're going to check out the canyons later. Think it'll handle the big stuff? Why don't you borrow it and find out? Oh, no, I couldn't do that. - Wouldn't feel comfortable. - Why not? You know your way around a wave. Go for it. You're not going to steal it. Promise you'll pick it up whenever you need to? Scout's honor. I'll even swing by and pick it up personally. - Ha. - Okay. Well, I'll let you know how it goes then. - Okay. - Later. See ya. "Scout's honor"? What? No wonder you're single. You're kidding me, aren't you? She couldn't take her eyes off me. Yeah, she was trying to work out... ...if you were my brother or my dad. Go play, jimbo. Oi! Drinks all around! Dream on, fellas. - Maybe next time. - Aww! So what do you reckon? Sensible thing would be to put it back in the mortgage, right? I don't know. I guess. Then next month we're back to square one. But if we bought, say, a planer,... ...made some templates, - a sander-- - electric sander? -- Electric sander, a ton of resin-- - some fiberglass. - What do you reckon? Eh? Why not, mate? Oh, ho ho! There's a rare sight. The Kelly gang out on the town. - Ha. Hi, Jim. - Miller. Andrew. Buy you a beer? Naw, just leaving, actually. Oh, fuckin' turn it up. Ron, another beer for Andrew here. What's big brother letting you drink these days, hmm? - Whatever I want. - Oh, whatever he wants. Thanks, Ron. Aw, come on, hang around. We're short a few sheilas. You're the one wearing the tassels. Like 'em, do you? Made 'em for myself in prison. Well, the cut really suits you. It's very slimming. Is that right? Why don't I take it off and give you a closer look? Calm down now, Miller. Take it outside if you want to muck around. It's okay, Ron. Leave 'em to their little shindig. Round of shandies for the boys. Eh? Let's go, Jim. Andrew, how much are we talking about exactly? I don't know. Five grand, kick it off. 5,000... dollars? Yeah, just for starters. Son, you're dreaming. I'm not going to lend $500 on a whim, let alone $5,000. And given the state of your mom's mortgage, I don't think now's the right time to be getting further into debt, do you? You just can't drift through life... ...like it owes you a living, Andrew. It doesn't. My advice? Head over to the mill... ...and ask Stan O'Reilly for your old job back. At least it's real. You're the only supplier in the state,... ...so I'm hardly going to screw you over, am I? You'll have your money by the end of the month. Bob, I guarantee it, okay? I just need a few blanks on tick to get me into the game, mate. I don't know. How's 20 sound? Yeah. Fantastic. All right. Great, see you then. 20 blanks on credit? I must have sounded like I actually knew what I was talking about. All those years of bullshitting might finally be paying off. Come check this out. What in Christ's name is this? It's a knee-board for Gus. - Um, j.B.'S idea. - You serious? It's an early Christmas present. You can't leave him on the beach all day. The little bastard would steal all my gear. We made something for you too. Whoo! Whoo! Oh it's all about her oh it's all about her I love her love, she's been so kind to me she's opened up my eyes... Whoo! The whispers and the summer wine may have made me realize whoo oooo it's not about her ooo ooo ooo ooo it's all about her. Hey! How's the new board, huh? Rips, yeah? Oh, man, it's responsive. I can feel it in my bum ankle already. Almost ate it a couple of times out there. It'd do you good to get out of control every now and then. Hey, did you see that? Did you see that? Man, this thing is unbelievable. Man, honestly, it's the best present ever. It is. - Yeah. - You're making it look too easy! I think it's less about me and more about the board. I'll have to make the next one even more radical then, huh? - Steady on, tiger. - Huh? That's awesome for surfers that can rip. Don't forget about the rest of the world too. - Bugger the rest of the world. - No, you think about it. There's a whole bunch of people out there... ...waiting to surf better because of our gear. We play our cards right, we could be shaping a much bigger future here. Shaping a much bigger future? Yeah, it's a TV ad. You cannot beat the man by becoming the man. Yeah? No, I'm just thinking big picture. What's wrong with that? All right, guys, good sesh. Catch you later. I'm just shaping surfboards, brother. That's all I'm doing. Ha! Gussy! Don't think I don't know what I'm talking about I'm leaving you, baby, without a doubt I don't need you no more don't need you, baby... Got room for one more? I brought tofu scrambles. Love is all the same I don't need you no more don't need you, baby you're biting off more than you can chew baby, I ain't ever coming home to you I don't need you no more... Don't need you, baby look so sweet, look so fine... Take your time, sweetheart! Doesn't even look like me. Whoo! Yeah! So much more than just you, kid. So you know everybody that there is to know puttin' on your charm like a little show I don't need you no more don't need you, baby... - Whoo! - Jimmy! That's you, brother! - Ho ho ho! - I don't need you no more don't need you, baby I don't want you, don't need you, baby oh! Don't need you, baby goin' on too long don't need you, baby ahhhh! Don't need you, baby I don't want you, baby don't need you, baby movin' on, don't need you, baby. See, that is the trip right there. Probably surfs solo most days. He's not battling for waves. He's not proving himself against anyone. That's it right there-- unreal. You reckon? I'd get bored. How does he even know how good he is? Who cares? Seriously, who cares? It's... I reckon the last thing on his mind is competing. You know, hey, we're pounding up and down the coast selling shit. He's out there. Look. Booah! He's living the dream. What are we doing? You can't buy what he's got, yeah? Especially if he's not selling. Where'd you learn to do all this? Raising sons. They went through clothes like you wouldn't believe. Just, you know, made sense to make all our own stuff. At least they're both boys. Probably just hand stuff down, right? Yeah, I wish. Those two, they're like chalk and cheese... ...when it comes to their taste in things. - Really? - Yeah. When they're not, look out. It can get ugly. Didn't expect you guys back so soon. - Manage to sell anything? - Ta-dah! Where did it all go? Inside barrels all the way from here to esperance. They saw the film, went nuts. It was like a feeding frenzy. - It's unreal, man. - Yeah, it is. What's this? Aw, it's a little something for getting us off the ground. Plenty more where that came from. Mmm. What time is it? A little after 3:00. I should go. You could always just stay here. Nice try, Andrew Kelly. Good luck tomorrow. As you can see,... ...sales projections, comparisons with overseas competitors,... ...ideas for new products down the line. The challenge here, Andrew, is that you're asking for a business loan. But what you're talking about is a leisure activity. Either way, we just sold out our entire inventory. Out of the back of your kombi. You said to start thinking like a businessman. That's what you said. That's what I'm doing. We lend to farmers because they grow crops. People need to eat. Where exactly is your market? Are you kidding me? 95% of aussies live on the coast. Our gear makes living on the coast better. I would have thought our market was pretty bloody obvious. - Andrew-- - that's just here. Now we can reach people all over the world, Mr. grumley. - Look, Andrew, I hear what you're saying. - How? I'm sorry, James? How can you hear what he's saying... ...when you've got your head shoved so far up your own ass? I thought that went well. Unbelievable. What? I was doing you a favor. You gotta be a farmer or a logger to score a loan in this town. You gotta get a haircut. They're never going to give us a red cent... ...because we're on the outside looking in. You know what? I'm cool with that. J.B.'S right, man. You can't buy what we've got,... ...especially if we're not selling. I've been wanting to bust this out... ...since I got back from Indonesia. And on the eighth day, God created this java lava. Stickiest hash this side of Lebanon. Ooh. Are you serious? You brought hash back from indo on a plane? Sure did, officer. It was too far to paddle. Who's got a light? Oh, it is on. And it was in that moment, man,... ...that I realized the past is behind you. And in front of you where that wave stretches all the way out, that's the future, man. Righteous, huh? Hey. I've got no idea what I'm looking at. Oh, it's all bullshit, really. Basically it means we're never going to make ends meet... ...working out of a backyard shed. To really make it work,... ...we need what they call the economies of scale. You like that? Read it in the paper. It's just a fancy way of saying, the more boards we make, the cheaper they are. So we either expand or we fold. There's no in between. I don't suppose you got a rich Uncle you can sponge off? I don't even have a poor one, mate. All right, enough business. I'm getting a drink. - You want one, Percy? - Oh, thanks, love. Whoo! Hello. What do we got here, sweetheart? Take a good look, boys. Might be the closest you get for a while. I don't know. Keep talking like that and I might take a closer look before the night's through. What do you say? Sweetheart, I wouldn't fuck you with his dick. Oi. Oi! Come here, you skank! Andy! Andy, watch out! Get off, you animal! - Ahh! Fuck! - Jimmy, watch out! Ah! Stop it! - Come on, mate! Come on, surfer boy! - Stop it! Come on, wax head! - Hey! Hey! - Stop it! You know, I think that's just about enough of that. Hey! It's got two barrels for a reason, brother. Small town, Andy. Let's go, boys! - You all right? - Yeah. Have a good night, wax heads! - I'm good, man. - That's right, everybody. Peace. Whoo! My pocket don't drive... Lani? Lani? My mother treats me slow my statue's got a concrete heart... Lani, what the hell are you doing? Are you-- are you kidding me? I had that totally under control. How was I supposed to know? I had a life before I came here, Andy. - I told you that. - Okay. I've dealt with that type of dickhead all my life. - All right. - I don't need you or anyone else... - ...trying to look out for me, all right? - All right. - Look at your face. - Take it easy. - Big tough guy, coming to my rescue. - Ow! - I get it. - Bunch of cavemen. I'll still have to thank him next time I see him. - Yeah, for what? - Ow. Hey, look what I found. - Hey. - What's all this? Check it out. My cousin's from torquay. And he reckons it lets him see right inside the wave. It's radical, huh? You want first go? Maybe later. It's all the more for us, mate. Ha! You can have first go. Okay, cool. Hey, gussy, don't worry about him. Ha. delightful rain and the whirling wind blows it's song around the bay and the whirling wind knows my name. Makaha. Makaha. What? What? It's a place, you idiot. It's where I grew up. I can see why you left. Looks awful. It does okay. You miss it? Not right this second. - - Lani? Yeah? Quick surf before breaky? Uh, yeah yeah. I'll be right out. - Good. Perce? Absolutely not, mate. Nah. Your payout's meant to support you in your retirement,... ...not invest in the fucking surf business. It's not for you to say. I mean, all that stuff about economies and scales and what have you. Who knows? You might be on to something. Percy, the bank took one look and laughed us out to the street, mate. I think they know a little more about smart investing than you do. I've been around the block. I know a good thing when I see it. I've even found the perfect place. Ah! Oh. Ha! Crafty old bugger. Oh, great, fellas. Thanks. Just put it here. Oh, hey. Hold on, hold on. Mass production, here we come. Oh, relax, comrade. It's a sewing machine, not a conveyor belt. Check it out! Fancy. - Know how to work it? - No idea. Mr. grumley? Great day, eh? Uh, yes, lovely. Thanks, Andrew. Hey, thanks for suggesting the name. It works perfect, eh? Hey, grumley! You ning nong! Looking good, Jim! Aw, Jim, that's beautiful. - Hey, get a photo, will you, love? - Ah. Come on, let's have a photo. This is either the start of something cool,... ...or the beginning of the end. - Oh, for God's sake, get in the photo. - Go go go go! Cheese! Hey! All right, before you go, I think this is a good opportunity for me... ...to give the rousing speech you're all expecting. - Here we go. - None of you will be surprised to hear... ...that I don't know the first thing about running a business. I thought they were generous letting you finish secondary school. Thank you, mom. Smile for the camera, over here. Still, I reckon we've got to have some rules. - Right, Jim? - What are we, girl guides? When there's surf, we surf... ...and when it's flat, we work. And guess what? They want to get my they want to get my gold on the ceiling I ain't blind it's just a matter of time before you steal it it's all right ain't no guard in my house... Yeah! Thanks. Hey, uh... Everything all right with Jimmy? - Yeah, why? - I don't know. He's just acting a little weird. Aw, he's fine. You, on the other hand-- I'm gonna need you to work back late tonight, miss kealoha. Of course. Anything pressing, Mr. Kelly? I'm sure I could think of something. Hey, mom, are you back here? Tony hemsley, you should be ashamed of yourself. - You all right? - Yeah yeah yeah, I'm fine. - You sure? - Yeah yeah yeah. What is this about? No idea. I think you do, son. The whole town knows what you lot are into. What I'm into? This is bullshit. You got nothing better to do than hassle innocent people? - Andrew? - I didn't know surfing was a crime just yet. It's not about the surfing, young cock. - Andrew! - Mom! A little bird told me about the other business you're into. What other business? Come on, mate. I've had an eye on your hippie mates ever since they moved to town. And now that you lot are all so cozy, I'm gonna keep an eye on you lot too. Got it? Good. So now I've got cops asking questions about drugs in my factory. - Huh? - Just breathe easy. Center your chi. Eh, fuck your chi. Relax. They got nothing on me. They got nothing on you. - They know about the drugs. - They don't know shit. Small-town cops. Just be cool... ...and they'll get bored and go away. And what if they don't? You get to pack your bags up, you sail on out of here. We live here. - So? - So. So you threaten that, you threaten me, man. You got that? Yeah. Andy? In through your nose... ...and out through your mouth. - - I don't do credit, man. Never have. Mate, it's for Tina, but. She's cool, right? - Tina? - Yeah. Why ain't she here begging me for a taste, huh? Stick to the weed, man. Hey, mate, I get paid next week. There's got to be something we can do. And you know, Andy, he doesn't have to know anything about it. Oi, come on. Oh! We don't open till 10:00, tom. You're not scaring any customers away until then, mate. How long you reckon they can keep this up for? Longer than us. Great. - Gus turned up yet? - No. Maybe he's got a bet going with the cops-- ...see who can put us out of business first. Terrific. Hey. Hey. You gotta be kidding me. How the hell am I supposed to compete with that? You know, sunny's won the smirnoff two years running. I can't get a pro to pick up the phone, let alone wear our gear. Well, if you ask me, I think it looks kind of stupid. - Yeah, right. - I'm serious. They're trying to get a surfer to look like a model. I don't know why they don't just shoot him doing what he's good at. Thanks for coming. Yeah, well, you should thank lani. Sure you're up for this? You know, we can wait for it to drop off if you want. And why would we want to do that? It's perfect. Check out the big balls on Andy, huh? About time you grew some. All aboard! You know they call it the morgue for a reason, right? Well, if you're not up for it, Jim, just say so. I won't tell anyone you turned down the chance to surf a Mountain. Aw, fuck it. Yeah! Come on. - What happened? - It's impossible. Way too much water moving under me. You know, the north shore boys reckon... ...the hardest part isn't riding them,... ...it's catching them. Go go go go! Go go go go go! - Haaa! Whoo! - Whoo-hoo! Whooo! Yeah, boy! Yeah! Whoo! Whooo! Hey! - Did you see the size of that last one? - Yeah. - Hoo! - He wasn't riding giants in the ocean king ad. - I'll tell you that much, mate. - That was another level, man. - One last one while we're here. - Nah, it's getting hairy. - We got your shot. - Come on, man up, will ya? You got your publicity. Let's go, huh? Righto, keep your shirt on. Close enough, man. Come on! You're gonna flood it! - Let's go, let's go! - Come on! We got too much weight. Jump! Don't you lose that! Ahh! - No worries, boys. - Careful next time. - Thanks, fellas. - See ya. - Sorry for the hassle! - Yeah. Oi! J.B.! Oi! - You coming in or what? - No. - Can't do much till Gus shows up. No point shaping any more boards without a glasser. It's just a mock-up. The ad agency's still tweaking it. So a real pro event? Uh-huh. The top surfers from all around the world here... ...in this tiny town, with huge waves. It's a big chance for ocean king to step onto the big stage. We've already booked sunny townsend as the face of everything. Sounds like a great opportunity. Which I want to extend to you. See, I know how hard it is setting up your own business. I also know there'll be a whole lot of hoopla... ...going on around here during the contest. So I want to make you an offer-- I want to give you guys first crack... ...at stocking ocean king gear here,... ...in your shop, on credit. Wow. Gee, thanks, Gordon. Um, probably not right for us just now. K- Mart want in. I'm stalling them, but I can't hold them off forever. Yeah, well, you've got to do what you've got to do. You-- you are kidding me, aren't you? Ocean king and drift-- could be the perfect fit. Just not right now, Gordon. Lots of work to do, mate. Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. Just don't leave it too long. G'day. Can I help you? How you goin', mate? Looking for a Gus doran. Does he work here? That's debatable. I got a delivery for him. 30 blanks. - Wanna sign this for me? - Do I have a choice? 30 blanks? Thank you, Gus. Sorry, man. He's killing me. Finally emerges. Thought I'd lost you there for a while. Hmm? Still no sign of Gus. It's almost two weeks now. I'm starting to get worried. You know, when I was his age, I used to disappear for months. He'll be fine. Yeah, nice seeing you too, j.B. Drift surf gear. Andy, I found Gus. He's, uh-- he's real messed up. All skin and bone. - You still there? - Yeah. He's not good, mate. I don't know what to do. I'll bring him straight over, all right? Take him to the hospital, Jim. Don't bring him here. Andy! He'll get worse before he gets better. Staring at him won't help. Feeling any better? Yeah. I'm good as gold, mate. Do you want anything? Yeah yeah. Could you take me back with you? - Gus-- - Please? I don't think I can handle it out here on my own. Ah! Yeah, we've been through all that. Just stay here, yeah? Enjoy the zen. - Oh, come off it, man. - What, man? Oh, I could just have a home-cooked meal,... ...you know, a proper lie-down, I'll come good. Hey, of course you will, man. Do it down here, away from all the other shit. Yeah, well, I'm fine, mate. Yeah, you're the perfect picture of health, man. Hey, listen. Hey hey hey hey. Tough it out here for the weekend. Yeah? I'll come back, we'll go for a wave. All right? Cool? Hmm. Yeah, cool, James. Saw the light on, thought somebody might be knocking off the joint. Yeah, good luck to him. There's nothing to steal. Hmm. Might have missed your calling. Well, necessity's the mother of invention, and all that shit. Is he all right? He's down the coast. He'll be fine. Right. You know, it wouldn't kill you to ask for help, yeah? Morning, Mrs. Kelly. Good morning, tom. How are you? - Mmm, bit nippy. - God, it's bloody cold, isn't it? What the hell? Do you want to come in and warm up for a bit? No, that's really not allowed. Well, just come inside for a cuppa... ...and then you can get back to it. Technically I'm on a stakeout here. Oh, for God's sake, tom, it's a cup of tea. It's hardly hash cookies. You still want to know why the cops trashed our place, did you? - Calm down, mate. - Calm down?! There's several kilos of heroin here. There's a cop parked out the front. Wonder where he got the idea from, huh? Surfers have been moving their stuff in boards for years. I didn't invent it. We should have been clearer with the fuckin' rules! It's not my responsibility, you fucker! Whoa, hang on, hang on, hang on. Someone's definitely gonna miss this. Listen, we've got to help him right now,... ...not throw him under a bus. He's one of us. He's a junkie, Jimmy! He's using our factory to import heroin! Have you got that in your head yet? Fuck, man, he's family! Grow up, Jim! He's put our family at risk. He's put you and me, mom, everyone at risk,... ...everything we've ever worked for at risk! Yeah, you're doing a pretty fuckin' good job of that all by yourself. - Ah! - Hey! You're a real chip off the old block, aren't you? Andy, you there? Jim, you all right? - Jim? - Yeah, he's fine. Just the planer caught an edge, whacked him on the nose there. Just the whole vibe's just changed right now. - The vibe. - Peace, brother. Hey, I just brought tom in for a cup of tea. - It's freezing out there. - One step ahead of you, mom. G'day, tom. Milk, sugar? Been looking for you. Haven't got all day. Yeah, well, you know, maybe it hasn't come in yet. I spoke to the supplier. It's been delivered. Stop wasting my fuckin' time. Relax, mate. I'm-- I'm just saying that you hope-- I just hope it hasn't been shaped and sold already-- ...maybe I'm not making myself clear. That gear belongs to some very heavy people. Right? There's not much they won't do to get it back. Which puts me in an awkward position, do you understand? Oh, I underst-- ah! Do you understand?! Hmm? - Well? - Okay, yeah. Fair enough. Fair enough, yeah. I get it. I'm sorry, man. I took your stuff. Excuse me? I took your stuff and I went through it all. The lot? What, two kilos in a week, you blew? I'm so sorry. Don't you fuckin' lie to me! Oh! I took it all, you dickhead! Do I look like a fuckin' idiot to you? Hey?! Tomorrow you're going to come bring me my gear. Because if you don't, I'm gonna come back here... ...and I won't be as forgiving next time, do you understand? Yeah. Oh! How's the nose? It's still there. Well, I guess that's something, right? How did we end up here? Welcome to the real world. Screw the real world. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna grab Gus and leave,... ...go up the coast, somewhere hard to find. Just leave. What do you reckon? Can I get you a cup of tea, Kat? Kat? Hey. I'm fine. Just a little bit wobbly today. Okay. Hey, it'll be all right. - I promise. - Yeah. I'm sorry. This is really stupid. I'm not usually like this. I'm fine. Cup of tea would be lovely. All right. Thanks, sweetie. Jeez, that's a bugger, isn't it? Hello, Andrew. How you holdin' up? Me, I'm fine. Terrible business, Gus. Ah, he was a good kid. I liked him. Bet you he'd be pissed off to know that he's left you in the shit, eh? I don't know what you're talking about, mate. Come on, don't waste my time, mate. It was him who came to me,... ...offering to get my product delivered to your factory. That's news to me. Oh, well, that's just a minor detail. What's a major fuckin' detail is it never got to me. So now it's real simple-- ...you either give me my gear or you give me my money. What do you reckon? What about you go and get fucked, we call it even? Hmm? Fair enough. Ha! You know, in some fucked-up countries,... ...they'll chop a bloke's hand off for stealing another bloke's gear. Ah! That's a silly place to park. I wouldn't do that if I was you, you fuckin' hippie. Take a long time to forgive that. I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let him go. Don't make me ask your mom, Andy. You have to go to the police. And say what? That I'm in a feud... ...with the local bikie gang over a drug debt? Which is not yours. It was delivered to my factory. I even signed for it. Okay, then call Gordon king. His offer is pretty reasonable considering-- ...considering what? I do that, then I become Gordon king. You're nothing like him. He never surfed a day in his life. It doesn't matter, lani! We're not selling out. That's the point. Tell her, j.B. Tell her. She's right. Sometimes you got to exploit the system, yeah, or the system's going to exploit you. It's darwinian, man. We adapt, we survive... ...and we move on. What the fuck are you talking about, after all we've been through? Having come this far? Is everything clear? Any questions, Kat, feel free to drop me a line. Then sign it and return it as soon as you can. Hello, Andrew. You're making a very wise decision, Mrs. Kelly. Mom? Hey! You really thought I'd agree to that, did you? It's not up to you. The house is in your mother's name. I think you'll find it's a very fair price. What, the exact same amount we paid for it 12 years ago? - The market's been very flat. - Andy! - You thieving prick! - Andrew, enough! Safe travels. Andrew, this way we get to pack up... ...and start again somewhere new. - We're not going anywhere, mom. - I know about Miller. Lani told me. I know about the whole thing. We fought for years to say that we live here. All right? And you're telling me that we're going to run away with our tail between our legs? Without so much as a fight? A real fighter knows when to stand his ground and when to walk away. I thought you'd worked that out by now. It'll sort out the bank, it's gonna take care of Miller. Your ankle won't handle it. Think about it. These are pro surfers from all over the world. - You'll be lucky if you even qualify. - It's $5,000, lani. Which you have zero chance of winning. You think I'm gonna roll over for these pricks, you've got another think coming. This is real. Miller is not going away. - Exactly! - Would you stop? What? You can't fix this on your own. Okay? You can't. Not this time. If Jimmy were here, it might be a different story. Yeah, but Jimmy's not here, is he? You know the trouble with being the last man standing? You got no one to share it with. Come on, come over here. Have a good surf, man. - Hey. - Hey. Is this the place to register for the qualifying events? Yeah yeah. What's your name? Andrew Kelly. Uh, nah, I've got a James Kelly. Yeah, that's my brother. I just want to compete in the open qualifiers. It's a pro event, so qualifying heats are invite only. - Sorry. - Price of popularity, I'm afraid. Hey, what do you think? Too big? She reckons you're not holding an open qualifying round, Gordon. I'm afraid not. Seems everyone from sunny down... ...wants a crack at the five gs. We are drowning in interest. So what difference would one more make then? You scared an unknown might scoop the pool? Jeez. You know what? It breaks my heart to see a grown man beg. Hey, I can't help you out there, though. Good luck. Day one of the ocean king qualifying round,... ...with some heavy waves out the back,... ...connecting right through to the inside bank here. Let's have a look. Big set coming through here. Turning and paddling hard is the seacliffe local, Andrew Kelly. Oh, it's a very low take-off-- no, he's made the drum! He's crashed right down through the lip! Oh, this is tremendous stuff. He's looking for the pocket. Oh, ho ho ho! Heavy wipe-out there from Andrew Kelly! Gee whiz, that's not going to impress the judges. I reckon he's already trailing on the scoreboard. Looks to be a little out of his depth in this building six-to-eight-foot swell. There's only seconds to go now, folks. Last chance for one lucky surfer to step up... ...and score enough points to make it through to the main event. Oh, ho! Top stuff! Coming from behind to snag the big wave of the set,... ...let's take a look. Ha ha, he's done it! Picking up enough points on that last ride... ...to scrape through to tomorrow's competition round. He's got to be stoked with that result. But with the best surfers from all over the planet,... ...including world 1 sunny townsend,... ...all lining up for a crack at the 5,000 bucks first prize,... ...well, things just got a lot tougher for the local lad. Thought you said this place was hard to find. Not hard enough, obviously. It's like the moon up here. You must really love your own company. What's not to love? Andy's going to surf the pro,... ...bad ankle and all. - You serious? - Mm-hmm. Figures he stands a shot at winning the five grand. You know, try and get Miller off his back. Oh. Good luck to him. Yeah, he'll need it. Seen the forecast? Big swell due to arrive at seacliffe tomorrow. Not sure Andy knows what's about to hit him. Here we are, folks, the day we've been waiting for,... ...day one of the main event. Get ready to watch the very best surfers... ...from all over the world, from Hawaii to Peru... ...to the U.S. of a., all going head to head with Australia's best. Surfers crossing here. - Asshole. Hey, come on, mate. Haven't got all day. Believe it or not, for once the weather bureau's got it right. The swell's come up overnight,... ...and now it looks like the sea gods are either smiling... ...or they're really pissed off, depending on your persuasion today. So anyway, buckle up, ladies and gentlemen. I've got a feeling things could get real bumpy. Didn't know they had a seniors' comp'. Real announcers and everything. How long have I been away for again? Jimmy! So here we go-- draw for the first heat today... ...is Harris, cay, Harvey and Kelly. - - You qualified? Fair dinkum? All competitors in heat one, please make your way... - ...to the marshalling area now. - Gotta go. Andy? I've been surfing perfect six-footers for the past six weeks. You look like you've been surfing a desk. Entries are closed. They're not gonna let you. I've already spoken to them. They'll let him surf, but only if someone else drops out last minute. Look, you dragged us here from day one,... ...kicking and screaming. Let someone else carry the load for a while. I've got this, brother. Trust me. Oh, hold onto your hats, folks. It's the real deal out there today. Whoa! There you have one of those new kook cords... ...the lads are using to hold onto their boards after a wipe-out. Can't see 'em catching on, though, if you ask me. I move like a cat, charge like a ram sting like a bee babe, I wanna be your man... Up riding again in yellow... ...is the last-minute substitution, Jimmy Kelly. Come on, Jim! Well, it's plain to see you were meant for me, yeah I'm your boy, your 20th century toy... Oh, how about that, folks?! Ferocious final ride from young Kelly. - Good stuff! - Ah! - Go, Jimmy! - That's my boy. Scorecards are in. You're not going to believe this. Winning his way through to the big final round... ...is the local lad, Jimmy Kelly! - Let's give it up for Jim. It's a shame he's not going to stick around for the contest. He's like a hermit crab-- wears his house on his back, pulls his head in when he feels bad vibes. Hmm, fair enough. Would it be okay if I threw out a blanket apology... ...for all the stupid shit I've said recently? Thanks for coming back. You still don't get it, do you? What? God, you're such a dumbass. You and Jimmy-- ...you're like yin and Yang. One pretty much sucks without the other. I'll take that as a compliment. Well, take it however you want. - I'll take it as a compliment then. - Fine, do it. This any use to you? You fixed it. Unreal. He'd have liked that. - Aww! - Jim, when you're out there today-- I already know what you're gonna say, and I agree. "Play it safe, make sure I get into the final,... ...no points for second." All right? I was going to say the exact opposite. You're a natural. J.B. Was right. Go for it, man. Get into it. It's the whole point, right? Oh, jeez, it's not for the faint-hearted out there today. The brunt of the big-storm swell has arrived. Mother nature has really turned it on for the final, folks. A minute to go... ...and it looks like it's come down to a two-man tussle... ...between Hawaii's sunny townsend... ...and Jimmy Kelly. Now Kelly's only a few points behind,... ...but really looks to be outclassed by the Hawaiian,... ...who seems to be in a league of his own out there today. Come on, Jimmy! Come on, Jimmy. Get inside him, mate. Get inside him! Sunny's all over him. Oh, this is clinical. We are watching a master class... ...on competition surfing right now. Oh, that's unbelievable! Sunny's hit the lip really hard then, people,... ...then floated right across the wave. That's ground-breaking stuff there... ...from the big-wave specialist from Maui. Ha ha! Hey? How good's this bloke? Let's see-- with 60 seconds left on the clock,... ...and trailing the Hawaiian on the scoreboard,... ...it looks like the local lad's left his run... ...just a bit too late, folks. Smile, will ya?! Get out of here, you lunatic! It's too big. You'll get smashed. Not today, my man. Not today. Here we go-- out the back. Hold the phone, people. This thing is not over yet. Go, jimbo. Go, son! Come on! - What do you think you're doing? - That's my brother out there. He's over there! Ah! You okay, you mad bastard? I blew it, man. I'm so sorry. Yeah! Yeah! How about this kid?! Ocean king, folks! Ocean king on an ocean king board. Get off the road, everyone. Get off the road. Okay, come on, get off the road. I know, right? Make sure you come back to us. Oh, wait, wait, don't forget your wax. Thanks so much. Where have you been? I've been trying... - ...to call you all morning. - Yeah, we disconnected the phone. - Good stuff, mate. - What is going on here? Wait, you guys haven't seen it yet? Seen what? Front page. Oh, Jimmy. Jimmy! - - It's been crazy all day. - - Drift surf gear. Oh, finally, man. The line's been busy for, like, the last hour. Yeah, it's sort of crazy down here at the moment. I imagine. T.J. Adleman from the surf hut in venice. I'm looking at your photo right now. It's a hell of a move, you know what I'm saying? Hell of a move. I already had some guys in here this morning asking after the boards. Hoping I'm not too late to place an order. - No, you're right. - Great, man, great. Why don't we start with, I don't know, say, 15? 15? Absolutely. That's great, man. 15 a month and then we can take it from there, cool? Let me just put you on to my sales department. Uh, lani kealoha. Grumley? I brought the house contract for you. That's terrific, Andrew. Yeah. Ow. Sheree. Yep yep, we'll have some more in next week. See you then. Hey? Looks like a bomb went off. Amazing what a little publicity will do. - Yeah. - Sure you don't want to stick around? And become part of the surfing industrial machine? I don't think so. Hey, give us a hand. Sure. Looks like you guys are off the hook then. Well, not completely. There's still Miller. Oh, right, you didn't hear, no. See, apparently someone tipped off the cops. And they raided his joint last night... ...and found a sizeable stash underneath the bed. You serious? What, heroin? No, it was high-grade hash from Indonesia. I didn't know he was into that kind of stuff. It's all karma, brother. Give 'em. So I hear they offered you a spot on the pro tour. Yeah, I'm still not sure about it. Man, what are you talking about? Huh? Go for it. Yeah. Just bust 'em wide open. Be gone! Where you going now? South. Maybe north. Maybe, I don't know. That's the whole trip right there, isn't it, man? See you when I see you. Ha. And in the morning I'll be waiting for your never-ending wave for our passage to arise but how can I explain? Yeah you came home for the endless summer on the white saw a different color in the street got a secret to repeat in my mind you're the ephemeral kind now to ever be touched by the feasting tendrils of the night now left to ponder your devotions now left imagining a time you came home for the endless summer watch me go paint a famous warrior of the light you were the strongest follower in my mind you are an endless summer an endless summer in my mind an endless summer in my mind an endless summer in my mind yeah, I get low and black witches hold my hand yeah, I get low feel no one understands now mistakes make mantelpieces bend now black cinders black cinder till the end you came home for the endless summer watch me go paint a different color of my life you were the deepest lover stay with me here in the endless summer an endless summer in my mind an endless summer in my mind an endless summer in my mind. Oh, it's all about her oh it's all about her I love her love, she's been so kind to me she's opened up my eyes the whispers and the summer wine may have made me realize wooo it's not about her whoo ooo ooo it's all about her.
