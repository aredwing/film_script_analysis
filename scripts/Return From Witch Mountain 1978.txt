[girl] can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts. [Bene] that's why we arranged this little vacation. We've been so busy establishing our community on Witch Mountain That you two haven't had an opportunity To see what life in the big city is all about. I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf. [chuckling] there'll be another time for that. Just remember what I told you, and have a lot of fun. - It's locked. - Tia? Tony, come back here. Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary. Tia? If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too. [tires screeching] [brakes squealing] You the party I'm supposed to pick up? - [Bene] just the children. - All right. Meter's running, hop in. I got it. [cabbie grunts] I've been waiting here forever. You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people. We're exactly on time. Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up. I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months. We have seats on the 50-yard line. [Tony laughs] Deliver the children to this address. You'll be paid after you arrive. This is a big fare here. If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip. Now, everything's been arranged. I'll see you Friday. - Ok. Goodbye, Uncle Bene. - Goodbye. - Have fun, you two. - [tires screeches] [engine revving] [horn honking] - Look at that dummy. - [honking horn] Get off the road, you dummy. [sighs] These civilians don't know how to drive. They ought to be kept off the streets. The streets belong to us professional drivers. Taxis, buses, trucks. That's all that should be allowed on the streets. You see, I happen to know a great deal about driving. I have a perfect safety record. [honking horn] Come on, get out of the way, you bum. [sighs] [car doors shut] [woman] thank you. Thank you, sickle. Well, this is a perfect test site. Little traffic... ...And low real estate value. It's adequate, I suppose. Ok, let's get this over with. This thing on all right? It's ready. What do you want him to do this time? I want you to climb that fire escape... ...To the absolute top. Wait a minute. Uh-uh. This is as high as I go. You want me to break somebody's leg? Just tell me how many pieces. But up there, I don't go. - Why not? - Because I'm afraid of heights. I will get dizzy. I will fall. That is true, Victor. He has acrophobia... ...Among other things. Find a different test for him. Acrophobia is not a problem with my device. Start climbing. I will do anything else you say, But I am not going up that building, understand? - I... - Sickle... ...I command you to climb up that fire escape. You will go to the very top, You will turn around, and you will look down. And you will not be frightened of heights. Off you go. It's working. It's working! It seems to be. Victor. Victor, you are risking his life. He's my nephew. My only living relative. He's the only one I can leave my... ...Uh, my bankruptcy to. That's what experimentation is all about, Letha. [Letha] we cannot afford to lose him. I am the only one we cannot afford to lose. Can't you see that I've got complete control over his mind? He has no fear, no memory, no will. He can only carry out my commands. - [car rattling] - what... What's happening? We're out of gas. What are you, crazy? Look at the dial, it points to... Empty. Empty? - [exhales] - [horns honking] It was all that waiting I had to do for youse. I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas. Boy, oh, boy. You guys are costing me a lot of dough. I sure hope you make the tip worth it. Something's going to happen to someone near here. We've got to help. No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver. I'll go. I think it came from back that way. Be careful. And remember what Uncle Bene said. That is enough. Bring him down! [victor] sickle, turn to your right. Balance yourself And walk along the ledge. [Letha] Victor, no. Stop. I'll bring him down myself. Give that to me. [wires crackling] Look what you've done. [exhales sharply] Sickle, stop. Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop. Sickle, this is Dr. Victor Gannon commanding you to stop! - He's out of control. - [Letha] sickle! Go back! [Letha screeching] sickle! No! Letha... Look. - I can't look. - You must. [footsteps approaching] [Letha] it's miraculous. There are no miracles, Letha. Only scientific explanations for everything. Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing. It... Must be... ...That... Boy. There's a... There's a force that... ...Centers around that boy. A force capable of countermanding The basic physical law of... Gravity. Victor, I don't know what you're talking about. Molecular mobilization. - I need that boy, Letha. - [horns honking] - I need him desperately. - Now, just a minute. Brilliant, my boy. Brilliant. Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic... Well, whatever it was you just did, It was absolutely heroic. It was nothing, I just... [gasps] [tires screeching] [sirens approaching] [dog barks] [helicopter approaching] [boy #1] get off the street! - [boy #2] run! - [boy #3] hide! [boy #4] here come the goon goons! [older boy #1] let's get 'em! [older boy #2] they run like chickens. [boy #1] more goons! [boy #2] we're trapped! [boy #3] hide or they'll get ya. Over here. [older boy #2] it ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans. [older boy #1] the earthquakes' got girls in their gang. Let's finish 'em. [older boy #1] hey! [older boy #2] now, where in the world did that come from? It was a set up. - Let's give it to 'em. - Yeah. - [all yell] - hey! [laughing] That was an ambush! [older boy #2] stop banging into me. [older boy #1] I can't see. [older boy #3] I can't get out. [older boy #4] get me out. Get it off me. [boys] yeah! All right! Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out. Yeah, thanks a lot. - What's your name? - Tia. - I'm Rocky. - I'm muscles. - Crusher. - And I'm dazzler. We're the earthquake gang. Does that scare you? - No. - Aww. Let's change our name again. We gotta have a name that scares. - Yeah. - Hey. How'd you do what you done? Well, I really didn't do anything. Yeah. You a magician or something? No. You want to join our gang? I'm sorry. I'm looking for someone. - Thanks anyway. - Aw, sure. I guess you're like the rest of them. You've heard we're a nothing gang. Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing. Someday we're gonna be the toughest. Take over the whole territory. Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block. All right. It's just that I've got to find my brother. What gang does he belong to? - He doesn't belong to any gang. - [boys snicker] I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang. I'm sure something's happened. I've got to find him. If anybody could find him, we could. I mean, we know this town inside out. Oh, would you? Hey, yeah, sure. Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, come on, let's go. That Tony sure made himself scarce. - We better walk you home. - Where do you live? I... I was supposed to stay at a hotel. But I don't know which one. You could stay in our hideout. - [boys] yeah! - Thank you. We'll look for Tony tomorrow. If we aren't busy beating up goons. - Yeah. - Hey, it's yo-yo. - Get down. - Come on, hide. - Did he see us? - I don't know. - But he's coming this way. - [Tia] who is he? - [muscles] our worst enemy. - He's worse than the goons. [Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto, the truant officer. He's trying to make us go back to school. [dazzler] let's go. [all] yeah! That's our hideout. [stairs creaking] [Tia] when do the ghosts get here? [Rocky] don't say things like that. This place could really scare ya. [gasps] Come on. This is where we're gonna live when we run away from home. Yeah, you can't be tough If you take orders from your mom or older sister. That's why we quit school. You can't be tough and educated, too. [crusher] yeah. - Tony! - [boys] where? I had a contact with him. You... You calling on the spirits? Shh. - She's weird. - She's creepy. I... I ain't too sure I wanna meet this Tony. Shh! Tony, where are you? He's coming in again. I can only see a light. That's all. Now it's... Going black. Now it's... Completely gone. [machines beeping] He's doing that? He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes As he struggles to regain consciousness. His output is so great, That my machines aren't even capable of measuring it. But he's dangerous. Once I have control of his brain, Letha, He will only be dangerous to others. I hope you realize that kidnapping's a criminal offense. My experiments are more important than the law, Letha. With these receptors placed on certain people, Combined with this boy's powers, I could become one of the most influential men in the world. Oh, you are absolutely brilliant, professor. Now we can go ahead with my plans, too. Don't bother me with your plans. They're empty, unimportant. A comment, perhaps, on you and the life you've been leading. Now, you look here, Doctor, professor, physicist. Whatever you are. I built this laboratory for you at great expense. I used every penny I had. Now, we've made a lot of plans and I won't let you upset them. I want some money. Fast. Letha, we are worlds apart. My mind is filled with large concepts. Mankind, the universe. You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race. Sure, I gamble... ...But with my own money. You're the worst kind of gambler. You use other people's money And want to keep all the winnings for yourself. Well, you can be sure of one thing, Victor. I'll be around to pick up the chips with you. - [wires pop and sizzle] - [Tony moans] [panting] [grunting] We'll be back in the morning with maps and breakfast. I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator. And I'll bring some day-old bread. - I'll bring some milk for you. - Thank you. - You're good friends. - That's the trouble with us. We don't want to be good. We want to be bad. Yeah. Hey, uh, let's go, you guys. My mom's gonna yell at me. [crusher] see you tomorrow, Tia. [muscles] we'll find Tony tomorrow for sure. [Rocky] let's stay close together on the way out, guys. [sighs] Good. This is professor Gannon... ...Commanding you to awaken. [indistinct shouting] Tony! He's in some kind of a room. Like a hospital. With machines and instruments and things. Oh, that's easy. All we have to do is check all the hospitals. While we going around looking for a fight. Come on. [victor] you will now function exclusively under control. You will no longer think independently. All thinking and reasoning will be done By the voice that commands you. Do you understand? - Yes. - What is your name? - Tony. - Where are you from? Witch mountain. Sounds like some hick town to me. How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air? By energizing matter. Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow? Yes, sir. - How did you learn to do this? - I was born with the ability. I wish to see a demonstration of molecular flow. You are strapped to the table. Unbuckle yourself and sit up. Power has come into our hands Which is centuries before its time. We must use it wisely. Well, what can you have him do? Other than go around making people's belts unbuckle. The possibilities are unlimited. Oh, come on. It's just some gimmick, that's all. Tony... Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved, Doesn't seem to believe in you. Mr. Sickle needs convincing, Tony. [knob squeaks] [gas hissing] Hey, come on. Hey, get back! Get back! Get back! Don't. [grunting] get back! [goat bleats] I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention. But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it? [goat bleats] I will demonstrate an industrial application. Come with me, Tony. [gas continues to hiss] Now, Tony, those wine casks... Stack them... Neatly. Two glasses of burgundy, please. To molecular mobilization. To molecular capitalization. - [goat bleats] - [gas hisses] [muscles] hey, got any more clues? No. Nothing at all. It's so strange. We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them. It's like his mind's a blank. He probably conked out somewhere. - Don't listen to him. - We'll find Tony for sure. Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down. Yeah. - [sickle] what're you doing? - [Letha] thinking. Thinking about us in a different place, such as... Las Vegas... ...With Tony. Seven or eleven every time, right? A day at the races. All the long shots come in. [laughs] you do have an imagination, after all. The possibilities with Tony are unlimited. For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them. If he can stack them, he can unstack them. The gold is on display at the museum. Protected by an impenetrable security system. Just sitting there waiting for us... ...To penetrate it. Wait a minute. Us? You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony? Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius. I own half the invention, Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits. So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero. What about security. We'd need an army to pull it off. We'll have an army with us! Tony. [chuckles] Tony? Tony? Tony, why can't I get through to you? Tony? I'll pick up the new transistors, make a few stops. Be back later on. [Letha] don't worry. Everything's under control. Tony. This is Letha wedge, Commanding you to open your eyes. Now, stand up. We're going to the museum for education and profit. [brakes squeak] Tony and I will do a little... Sightseeing. [indistinct chatter] [Tia] wait. Gold! I see gold. - Hey it's mine. - Where is it? - Hey, give it to me! - No! A stagecoach. She must be tuned in on a western. Yeah. I see dummies. [both] that's you. No. Old things. Clothing. Hey, he's at the salvation army. Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army. They don't got gold, neither. Wait a minute, wait a minute! We had one of them nothing school trips. To the museum. Yeah, they got a pile of gold. And a stagecoach. They had to kick me out. We've got to go there. Come on, it's over here. [kids grunting] [indistinct chatter] [tires screech] Now, Tony. We're going to create a little diversion. The stagecoach. I want you to roll it all around the museum. [woman gasps] [woman] look out. [man] watch it. [man] watch out for that thing, it's coming this way. Hey, where are the horses? I... Don't know. Now cause total chaos. [man] watch out. [yelps] Short circuit the control system. [control system buzzes] [indistinct yelling] [guard screams] Oh, no. Letha! Letha! [indistinct shouting] [chortling] - [gasps] - look out. [man] get out of my way. [moaning] [guards yell] [man] can't you put that thing out? Come on, take a shot. Move it. Now, Tony, Make a hole in the plastic shield. And it doesn't have to be neat. Tony, unstack the gold bars and deliver them to Mr. Sickle. [man] move it buddy, move it. We gotta get out of here! Las Vegas, here we come. Oh! - Look. - [bars thudding] Come on, follow me. Tony, make them go faster. [woman] watch out! Hey, Letha! Hey, Letha! - [woman screams] - [man] hey! [indistinct chatter] Look out, lady. Yeah, why don't you watch where you're going, you big dummy. [gasps] [man] look out, Eddie! [Letha] Tony, what's happening? [Tony] molecular flow reversing. - Are you doing this? - No. Then who is? It would have to be one of my people. - There are more like you? - Yes. - Oh! Let's get out of here. - [Tia] Tony! Tony! Who's that? It's my sister. My sister, Tia. This is no time for a family reunion. [crowd murmuring] [victor] Letha! Tony! [victor] you fool! How could you do this? [Letha] not now. - [door shuts] - [engine sticking] - What's wrong? - I don't know. I keep it running perfect. It's Tony's sister, she did it. She's as weird as he is. Tony, I command you to make this car run perfectly And continuously without interference from your sister. [engine starts] I can't stop the car. Tony's energizing it. It's like your brother doesn't even know you. - [Rocky] it's yo-yo. Let's go! - No. Don't run. You crazy? You don't want to go to that school. Please, trust me. Now, come on, hurry. [Rocky] hey, wait for me. [dazzler] come on, you guys. Get in there. - Let's go! - Come on, get in. - [door shuts] - I'm dreaming. You're surrendering to the board of education? Sir, you see that car going down the street? - Yeah. - My brother's in it. He ought to be going to school. You ought to catch up with him. Another truant? Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load. - Hey, what happened? - Good driving, yo-yo. Yeah, that was neat. [laughs] this bus can really move. Tony, look through the window. The rear window. That minibus is following us. I command you to place obstacles in its path. [tires squeal] City property. I've damaged city property. [moaning] [panting] they said these glasses were shatterproof. Was that a bus or a bridge? They're still with us. Tony, you must stop her. Man, that man was really buzzing. Am I still alive? [tires screech] They're gaining on us. She counteracts everything that Tony does. Tony, you've got to stop her. We flew! [boys cheering] They must've flown. Don't you dare try it. Sickle... Sickle, stop... Stop over that hill. Tony, cause the reflection of the sun on the rear window To magnify and shine so brightly That our pursuers'll be blinded by it. [glass breaking] [van scrapes road] [muscles] come on, open the doors. [crusher] I can't see. - [Tia] yeah. - [muscles] come on, let me out. - Everybody ok? - [all kids] yeah, sure. Oh, look what's happened to city property. No... But I'm still gonna take you to school. - Just soon as I... - Come on. [siren approaching] You jeopardized my life's work. My accountants' are desperate. You've proved yourself incompetent yet again. I don't even know if I can trust you anymore. You don't trust me? I trusted you enough To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese. Don't tell me you don't trust me. We have to trust each other. Right. I trust everybody. Yes... Well, fortunately, I thought of something very spectacular Which will satisfy both of us in terms of prestige and money. Well, you have the prestige, I'll take the money. But, before we celebrate your return to sanity, We'd better do something about Tony's sister. How did she know we were at the museum? I... I'm not certain. Tony. How did your sister know that we were at the museum? Telepathy. She'll show up again and ruin everything. In that case, she will have to be, as you would say... ...Scratched? [Tony whispering] Tia. [louder] Tia. Tia! [Tia] what happened to you? [Tony] I can't explain now. I've lost the power to energize. [Tia] where are you? [Tony] follow my voice path. Please! [Tia] ok. Guide me. [dog barks] Tony, which way? [Tony] this way. [sirens blaring] Which way, Tony? Which way? [Tony] keep moving straight ahead. This is the house. Here, look. Come on. - [door closes] - down here. [goat bleats] Be quiet, Alfred, you silly thing. [Tony] Tia! Tony! [yells] [gas hissing] I've put her into a state of comatose neutralization. [crusher] hey, Tia. We got you some cold hotcakes. She ain't here. Hope she didn't go looking for Tony without us. Yeah, she needs us. [Tia] Tony? Crusher? Muscles? Rocky? - Dazzler? - [Alfred bleats] Alfred. Alfred, what's the matter with me? Where am I? Alfred, find the earthquakes. [bleating] Listen to me. [bleating] [hoof steps approaching] [bleating] [sickle] what kind of place is that? [victor] that is an underground plutonium processing plant. Translate that into financial terms. Plutonium is more valuable than gold. That's why I like scientists. They're always discovering new, expensive things. It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads. I suppose you're going to have Tony Split an atom bomb or something. In effect... ...Yes Well, I didn't count on killing anybody. Especially not us. It will never go that far. They will pay anything to prevent it. This is the first step towards my becoming The most powerful man in the world. Ids, please. Take a powder. [laughing] Tony. Those are the outer security scanners. Put them out of commission... ...Permanently. [static] The scanning systems are malfunctioning. All right, let's run a maintenance check. Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right. - Where to? - Andy's place, know it? Yeah, sure. I know where everything is. Second and third? - [man] fourth and market. - That one. - Hop in. - I'm in a hurry. Could you... [grunts] - Don't worry. - [tires screech] Have you there in a couple of minutes. [Alfred bleats] Listen. Feel the power in this cab? - [Alfred bleats] - it has lots of power. You know, everybody tells me, I ought to be a race driver. - What do you think? - [bleats] Well, I think you're wrong. Don't worry about nothing, sir. I'm a very safe driver. - Want me to tell you how safe? - [Alfred bleating] I'll tell you anyway. I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months. And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab. In fact, next month, They're gonna give me a gold safety award. - What do you think of that? - [bleating] Boy, you don't like nothing. - I sure hope you're a good tipper. - [bleats] I knew there was something about you that didn't look right. [tires screeching] [cabbie] hey! Hey! You owe me a fare! [cabbie sighs] - Officer, that goat's a guy. - The goat? The guy became a goat when I'm driving. The guy? This magician beat me out of this fare. The magician? - My perfect record. - Record? Oh... Record. I ain't gonna get the gold safety award. - [hoof steps approaching] - hear that? That must be her. - [bleats] - come on. [boys grunting and panting] [dazzler] help me. [grunts] hey. Watch out. - [bleating] - get him away. - [moans] - how'd you get in here? Hey, come on, get out of here. [Rocky] watch out! He's looking at me like he knows me. Hey, what do you want from me? Get away! He's got Tia's vest. Get him! Quick. - [phone ringing] - we're going for coffee now. - [phone ringing] - can I bring you a cup? May I see your ids, please? Tony? Show him our id. What's happening? Why? Don't leave me up here. Open the door, Tony. You can't go in there without ids. - Now seal it. - How do I get down? [boys panting] Tia! - Quick, let's get her out. - Yeah. - Phew, it smells. - [boys cough] It's some kind of a gas. Come on. [inhales deeply] You ok now? Yes, thank you. This is some kind of... ...Science place. - How'd you get here? - It was Tony. He was here. I saw something! What was it? It's where Tony is. I'm sure of it! A big, round shape. A doughnut! He's eating a doughnut. No way! Is it like a ball? A great big ball? - Yes. - I know where he is. Let's go! Hurry, let's go. [Alfred bleats] Oh, thank you. And thanks for everything. Come on, let's go. We are about to make scientific history. [Letha] and some money, too, I hope. You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace. [alarm ringing] It's a red light on the cooling system. It must be a circuit breaker. Restart the system. I can't get a restart. Hit the backup system. It's no-go on backup. Temperature increasing in the furnace. - Get that coolant flowing. - [phone buzzes] - Furnace control. - Control? You don't really think you're controlling anything, do you? - [alarm continues buzzing] - who is this? [victor] this is Dr. Victor Gannon, And I have just shut down your cooling system. Ok, you've shut it down. Get it back on again! Tell him how expensive it is to put it back on. In exactly one hour, we shall be serving grilled plutonium, Medium rare, to the atmosphere unless the following conditions are met. What conditions? Five million dollars in cash. A jet waiting at the airport. A safe escort, of course. And most important of all, You will announce that Dr. Victor Gannon Has achieved molecular control and mind control. And this is the first of a series of worldwide demonstrations of his power. [line cuts out] How long does it take to count five million dollars? [alarm ringing] [indistinct yelling] [siren wailing] [indistinct shouting] [machines beeping] We'll have to pay them. Evacuate the immediate area. Put Los Angeles on alert. [horn honking] There's the big round ball. - Is that it? - No, it was bigger than that. Get outta here. Leave me alone. At least I tried. Hey, look. It's yo-yo. Let's get out of here. Come on. [radio plays music] Hey, yo-yo. Don't you want to catch us? I don't trust him. He's probably using some psychology trick on us. Come on. [dazzler] hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us? It's not my job anymore. They're coming down to fire me... ...For destroying city property. The only thing that works is the radio. And it won't turn off. I was only trying to help you kids. Mr. Yokomoto, I'm sorry about everything that's happened. All I ever wanted in life Was all you kids that I put back in school, someday... ...Visit me and say, "thanks Mr. Yo-yo, Yokomoto. If it wasn't for you forcing us to get an education, We would've been bums." That's all I wanted. You see? I told you he was gonna... ...Hit us with some of that heavy psychology. I mean, I feel guilty. [man on radio] bulletin from the plutonium plant. Unless the demands of the terrorists are met, The furnace will explode with the force of ten megatons. An official describes the atomic furnace controls as frozen in position, - As if "the molecular flow..." - that's Tony! - The plant is being evacuated. - That's where he is! - We've got to go there. - How? Take a bus? - We'll go in this. - Tia, the tires are flat. Come on. [tires screech] [machine beeping] If it doesn't start cooling soon, The chain reaction will start. You hear that? In ten minutes, This place is going to be a hole in the ground. Now, let's be reasonable. We have three and a half million dollars in the control room. And the balance is on the way. It's a deal. I do not compromise. [alarm continues] - Hey, what are you guys doing? - [man] nothing! Nothing! We're doing nothing. - Hey, kids! - [man grunts] How did these children get past security? Sir, the people destroying the furnace kidnapped my brother. If I could see him, I might stop them. - [boys] she can do it! - She can do it. - [alarm beeps] - do what? Impossible, they're inside the room. They've sealed the door somehow. - What part has to be fixed? - The emergency cooling system. - Where is it? - Five levels down. But it's too late. We've already begun to evacuate the plant. Tony's here, all right. Get me down. Thank you, thank you. Now, where are you going? In there. Oh, no. You can't go beyond this point without ids. - [footsteps approaching] - [Tia] Tony! - Tia! - I knew it. She'll spoil everything. I can just taste that money. We cannot let her take it away from us. Tony! Tony, from this moment you will no longer hear Tia. She cannot break through my power of control. - Acknowledge. - [Tia] Tony, what's wrong? It's me, your sister. Try to remember me. Acknowledge. Tony? - Yes, sir. - Get those kids. She'll use some of those molecules on us. I'll take care of her before she gets a Chance, you get them. [Tia] I can't get through. I don't know what they've done to his mind. We've got to find the emergency cooling system ourselves. How do you spell cooling? Come on. - [Tia] uh-oh. - [muscles] whoa. [Rocky] look out. [rapid footsteps approach] We've got to find the emergency switches. You two go that way, and you two go that way. Tony, we must eliminate Tia. [footsteps approach] You will cause that portable utility panel to run her down. - Hey, Tia, come here. - [machines whirring] Come on. That ain't it, right? - [Tia] you found it! - I knew it was it! But, it's spelt wrong. You guys get dazzler and muscles. Ok. Come on. [door opening] The rest of the money's just arrived. All right. I'd better call Gannon. The cooling system's on. Switch it off. [man] we lost it! What's going on down there? It's coming back. 650, 600... Gotcha! Tony, you must stop her. Tony, why are you doing these things? Why are you using your powers against me? What's happened? Tony... ...Pretend to remember Tia. Lure her to the center of the room and... ...Make that crane drop on her. Tia! I'm starting to remember. What was the matter with you? I don't know, exactly... But... I need help. Don't go any closer. Why? What is it, Tony? Tony, stop it! Stop it, Tony, stop it! Exert a force greater than hers. Why are you doing this, Tony? Stop. Crush her. Kill her! Crush her! Crush her! Crush her! Finish her! - Now! - [Tony groaning] Tia. Where are we? What's happened? [victor screams] - Ha! - [boys yell] [victor] Tony. Tony, we can still do it. We can still make use of molecular control. Ok, doc, let's do it. [moaning] [grunting] [footsteps approach] [boys pant] [victor] Letha! Why don't we all go and have some... Some candy and, uh, sodas and ice cream? [Letha moans] Next time... - ...Next time I'll... - Forget it. I've lost my faith in science. - [sickle grunts] - huh? [boys moan] [victor] sickle! [moaning] Aunt Letha! Oh, aunt Letha. Help. [gasping] aunt Letha? Aunt Letha? It's absolutely dreadful the way they bring up children these days. - Come on. - [engine shuts off] Tony, the bus won't run without me in it. It's all my fault. It's such a mess. Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it. I'm sure Uncle Bene won't mind. I'll do the engine. You do the body work. - Ok. - So long, Alfie. - Goodbye, Alfred. - [blows kiss] [bleats] What job will you do now, Mr. Yo-yo, uh, Yokomoto? Oh, I've saved my money. I'll probably open a Japanese delicatessen. - [metal scraping] - hey, kids, look. I don't understand this. - Man! - Wow, what a family. The molecules must have rearranged themselves... - ...Somehow. - Uh, that's a possibility. You know what this means? They never saw the wreck. I'll tell them that the reports were exaggerated. And, if you kids will go back to school, I'm sure they won't fire me. You will go back to school, won't you? Well, if we was to go back to school, Could we get as smart as Tia and Tony? - Maybe even smarter. - Yeah, sure. Let's give it a shot. Great. I hope the school can take it. - Goodbye, yo-yo. - Goodbye. - [Rocky] see you later, yo-yo. - You promised. Tia, open the gate. No, everybody join hands. - Whoa. - Wow. [boys] cool! [muscles] all right! Wow! Flying saucer! Will we ever see you again? Well, it's... It's kind of hard to say. Thanks for everything. And especially for letting me be in your gang. Take care of Alfred for me, ok? [all laugh] There you are. - Where's your luggage? - Uh, we lost it. There were a few problems. - But you did have fun? - Oh, terrible. I just knew we should have gone surfing. [mechanical whirring] [all] wow. Hey. Let's do it the way Tia and Tony taught us. [all] yeah. - Ready? - [all] one, two, three! [all grunt] - Hey, yo-yo! - Yo-yo! [panting] guess what! Tia and Tony just drove off in a flying saucer. - Flying saucer? - Whoosh! Whoosh? How about whooshing yourself into the bus? But, it's true. Lookit, I saw those two kids do miraculous things. I believe anything and everything, except that. Get in. I hope this school teaches about flying saucers. Yeah. Flying saucers. [laughs] [engine starts] [mechanical whirring]
