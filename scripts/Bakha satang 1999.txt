The scenery is to die for, and this coffee is really delicious. Wait a sec... Oh no, something's wrong! What? I forgot to bring money with me except credit cards. - What should I do? - Look again, carefully. I forgot to draw some money from the bank. I am so sorry. You won't believe me to pay back next time, will you? Here, let me return this to you. It's already become useless. - Go ahead, have the rest. - Thank you. I promise you to pay for it next time. Look and smile. Say Kim-chi. - Excuse me. - One, two, three! - Good afternoon, sir. - Hi. Uh... Kim! What are you doing? Are you the owner of this car? Yes. You're not allowed to park here. Your driver's license, please. - Show me your driver's license. - This isn't my car. You said it was your car. This isn't a stolen car, is it? - Take out your identification card! - What for? Your identification card, right this moment! Stop! Stop there! - Who is it? - It's me. Why are you here? Saemin? She's asleep. I asked why you came without any reason. Poppy. I wanted to see Poppy. Poppy... That's enough, now. Poppy! Go! Get back in! Why? Why? Kim Youngho. You're Kim Youngho, right? Move there. I'll try it. Why are you carrying so many keys like these? Now, you can get in. Come on in! Have a seat. Apologies for such shabby hospitality. It was a difficultjob tracking you down. It's leaking in a new place. Last night, the rain fell on my forehead, as I lay in bed. You, sit down! Fucker! This isn't a game, sit! Isn't the way I live pathetic? Wonder why I live this way? Although I don't know who sent you, I want to talk with you. It's a good mood, isn't it? Want a drink? But there's no booze here. With the last bit of my money, I bought this. To kill just one guy with. I don't want to die alone. I need one bastard to come with me. Just one bastard among all that ruined my life. But then... Who should I kill? It gives me hard time, you know Pick just one is hard thing to do. The fucking stock broker who made me go clean broke? The vampire like loan shark that charged the ridiculous interest? Or... How about the business partner who run away with my money? Or should I take my ex-wife and my kid to die with me? There're so many fuckers in my life that it's hard to pick just one. You! I don't know why you're here. This isn't just your day. Choose! Want to watch? Or leave now? You know Yun Sunnim, don't you? Who? Yun-Sun-lm. I was sent by her. Who is Yun Sunnim? Don't you remember? You two... liked each other before. Oh! Yun Sunnim. But why is she looking for me? Who are you? I'm her husband. She wants to... ...see you. You're joking, right? Why does she want to see me? Will you do me a favor? What is it? I bought some clothes this morning. I hope they fit you well, Mr. Kim. You're saying I should wear this? You wanna put me in trouble, huh? What's that? Can't be going to see someone in the hospital empty handed. Want one? It's a peppermint candy. Really delicious. What's wrong? I was told that she lost her conscious this morning. She could even talk to me last night. Too late. I know, but... I want to see her face, though. Honey, Youngho has come. Sunim... It's been a long time. Do you remember this? Peppermint candy. When I was in the army, You sent these to me. You put a candy in every letters. I've saved them. In fact... I got in trouble owing to them. As you sent back then... Look! They're still in the same shape. I'm sorry, Sunnim. Kim Youngho! Kim Youngho! I forgot to give something to you. She wanted me to give you this. She said it's not hers, but yours. She also said she was just keeping it for you. It's so old. Nobody uses a 20 years old camera. Think who wants to use a manual camera these days? - How much can you give me? - I will pay for 30,000 won. How can you fix just 30,000 won? You'd better look for another shop. - How about 50,000 won? - 40,000 won. It's the maximum. Okay, then. Hey, Mister! Film in the camera. Take it back! Life is Beautiful Life is Beautiful Summer 1994 Miss Lee? You came early. No phone calls yet? Who? And so... Why do they want to be paid before giving us the goods? If he calls, refuse it. No. I'd better take care of it. What? Why are you saying like that? What? I can't talk to you that way? My business dull now a days. It makes me crazy. Let's have a drink. I have to buy... No way, I should be the one to buy you drinks... If you insist that way, then I won't see you. She said she's going to get a driving lesson. I don't know where. Anyway... Make sure she doesn't notice you, When you're following her. Call me. Hey! Give me a cup of coffee. Yes, sir. Kim, what's making you feel good? Have they gone up again? Tire has gone up by 300 won. 300won's not a small amount at all. You're making money at stocks as well as at your business. - Hey! - Yes, sir? Who do you think, I am? You are the president. Right. I'm the owner. Then, why did you brought coffee without a saucer? - I am sorry, sir. - You've betrayed me... That's enough. Buy me a lunch!

Getting water into your lungs makes you get pulmonary emphysema. No one's responsible for that. So, tell me where Kim Wonsik is. This can be over in 10 minutes, you know. I wish I could tell you. I haven't seen Wonsik recently. This is your diary where you wrote you gave Wonsik 130,000 won. It means you met Wonsik and gave him money. I met him... We met him, but I don't know where he is. Hold him down. What? Shit! Let's complete. What the hell is party? Golden memories filling the sky, I'll be forgotten like dew on a grass. With old memories love flew away. Faces reflected on their eyes will be faded away. What'll I be after long-long time. I wander about so far away. I'd better be a flower forever. Tomorrow and tomorrow - How old are you? - Why are you asking? - You are a under 20, aren't you? - No. - None of your business! - Don't trick. You are under 20. Why are you here?

Who are you looking for? You seem to have a history. Right? Tell me. With raining, I am so bored. I heard... my first love lives in Kunsan. I don't know exactly but somewhere in Kunsan. If you don't know where she is, how can you see her? It doesn't matter. I just came... She lives here. I can walk on the same street where she's walked. And see the same ocean that she's looked at. But what can you do while it's raining? That's okay. Since we are in the same rain now. The rain I'm looking is the same rain she's looking at. You are good at fooling people! You think I'm making this up? Hey! I want to be the woman you're looking for tonight, can I? Bye! Hey... Tell me, the name of the girl you're looking for. Tell me. Sunim. Yun Sunim.

But they didn't let me. You didn't even know I'd come to see you. Hands, Your hands, Youngho. What's wrong with them? You seem totally different from who you're except your hands. Your hands are unique. Fingers're blunt and ugly, but seem so sweet. When we first met. Your hands made me think you're a good person. That's what I've thought. You're right. My hands are so sweet. Why? Why are you acting like this? I've always wanted to touch you like this. Sweet, aren't they? Although it's not expensive, It took me long time to save up for this. Remember?
