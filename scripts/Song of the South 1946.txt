Sally: Uncle Remus, i'm trying my best to bring up Johnny to be obedient and truthful. But you and your Sally: stories are making that very difficult. I think maybe it would be better if he didn't hear any more for awhile. Remus: Well, Miss Sally, de stories ain't done no.... Sally: They only confuse him. Now I know you mean well, Uncle Remus, but Johnny's too young. Remus: Miss Sally..... Sally: I'll have to ask you not to tell him any more. Remus: Yassum, Miss Sally...... Sally: But what else could I have done, mama? I can't just overlook it, he has to learn to mind. Doshy: That's very true, but without Uncle Remus and his stories, Doshy: the child will be utterly desolate. He needs something to hold on to. Sally: Well, he has his mother....and his grandmother. Doshy: We're not enough, sally. The boy must have friends. And if it's not Uncle Remus, or the Favers Doshy: children, then it must be someone else.... someone of his own age. That's just good common sense. Tempy: What you trackin' through here for anyway? Ain't I done tol' you 'bout messin' 'roun' my kitchen? Sally: Johnny! Johnny: Yes, mama.
