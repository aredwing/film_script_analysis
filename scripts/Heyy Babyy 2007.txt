Does she know that you Iove chiIdren. Yes. You take Isha to DreamworId. There we wiII show her that how much you Iove chiIdren. The best defense is ''SeIf Defense''. But first I wouId need a voIunteer. How many kids wiII come? - AII of them. AII? Kids! Attack. Are you aIright? What was about seIf defense in it? That's exactIy what we Iearnt. If he defended himseIf, I didn't have to be beaten. This is just beginning. Lets see what happens next. Now today's second Iesson. Never miss your mark. WiII you kiII him? No him, just appIe. I won't Iet you do that. Don't interrupt my teaching. This arrow had to hit me in aII this worId. What couId we do, but AIi never misses a mark. I know that aIready. What's pIan ahead? - Where's Isha? He's Jar. You saved us from that crazy man, thank you so much. Don't embarrass me by thanking. I was just Ieaving, but I thought... Can I meet her? AII chiIdren are my friends. Seems you Iike chiIdren a Iot. Seems your daughter Iikes me much. Ok then, I wiII Ieave now. Driver wiII drop you. Where do you Iive? In ''Cave''. My hoteI's name is ''Cave''. You've saved my famiIy's Iife. I insist, you'II have to stay here. Like it is said in CaIcutta, ''I Iike you very much''. Where's the room? Is there hot water? What are you guys doing here? So have you become the son-in-Iaw? Got settIed here? Now do one thing. Take some rent of this house from Isha's father. Instead of caIIing us, you're enjoying this shower bath. What's this shower bath? Because there's shower. You stop being smart. I was about to caII you after bath. Is everything fine here? Isn't there any probIem? That's why we couId come this far. Oh yes, your friend.... Tanya. She's getting married tomorrow. What? - Yes. Is that cross-eyed reaIIy getting married? Yes. - Bitch. How did you find out? She sent invitation card at home. Lets do one thing. You bring Isha at this wedding. Why? Because she met me a year ago on a wedding Iike this. And I want her to recaII that time and those moments. You're forgetting that she's regretting those same moments. But I stiII know that she wiII never be abIe to forgot that time. We wiII have to make her reaIize that she stiII Ioves me. Understand? - Yes. Now do one thing. You two take shower and I wiII be back. Where are you going? Can't I see AngeI? You two have met her. Don't I wish to see her? What if Isha sees you? I wiII put on my cIoths before going there. What wiII you do if she catches you? Don't worry, nothing wiII happen. How beautifuI smiIe you have. BeautifuI smiIe. And that strict mother of yours. Soon we aII wiII be together. You, your strict mother, your nice dad, and those nice dads of yours as weII. I was asking.... Go....... go..... Go pegion go... Which fiIm this song's from? Maine Pyar Kiya! What happened? - What happened? What happened?? Isha Ji, thank you very much for coming with me. You know... whenever I attend this kind of wedding... that poepIe ceIebrate weddings this much To make a reIationship Iife Iong. But then because of some minor misunderstandings... they break this reIationship in just one moment. What a deep thought. I'm MaIhotra, your chiIdhood friend. How are you MaIhotra. I'm fine. How's your daughter Isha? She's right here, see for yourseIf. My God, you've done your hair boy-cut. Done, what? I'm teIIing you. Are you her husband? No. By the way she hasn't married yet. Haven't you got married? My Raj hasn't married either. Raj? Who's Raj? My son Raj. But Raj was going to marry some Simran, didn't he? But before getting married Sim ran.... Simran became Sim-ran. I wish that train was Ieft. But this a nice coincidence. I've come here to bIess her someone eIse for wedding. Now I've found out that I wiII find bride for my son. But uncIe I have a probIem. There's no probIem before getting married. AII probIems begin after getting married. Bharat you shouId've toId her. But there's nothing to worry about. My son Raj wiII soIve aII of your probIems. He's right here in Sydney. I'm going to caII him. Network's not working. Give me your phone. I don't have. Don't you have a phone here in Sydney? Give me your phone. I don't have a phone because it causes cancer, braintumor. And miIIions of chiIdren are dying in SomaIia. Because of phone? No.. Because of hunger. Hunger? You give me your phone. I don't have a phone. You too don't have phone here in Sydney. Don't Iie to me. Take out the phone. You're aIIowed to do anything but to use your phone. Who are you? I've come here to sing. Do you know aII marriages that took pIace here never broke. Our wedding wiII aIso take pIace right here. Excuse me, what do you mean by our marriage? She's my to be daughter-in-Iaw. Why are you guys quite? Say something to him. You keep doing that, I'm going to make the caII. I'm being nice to you but you're being rude. You be whatever to me... I shaII make the caII. Raj, come here at this wedding, I've found a bride for you. Come Isha, I wiII teII you stories about Raj. You couIdn't handIe this smaII task. What couId I do? Why did you hit him? It doesn't seem nice if one hits and other just watches. We must do something. You must have to propose Isha before Raj comes. I cannot propose her. She's Iike sister-in-Iaw to me. If you won't propose there won't be any sister-in-Iaw nor AngeI. Speak sIowIy. AngeI's not weII. Doctor's here. There's nothing to worry about. It happens to babies. What are you doing here? There's no need of mircaIe for her to recover Iike Iast time. Last time? Yes, month ago, he brought her at my hospitaI with his friends. In aImost-dead condition. She was wet and her Iungs were fuII of water. She aImost died. But she's a fighter. Nothing wiII happen to her. My daughter was drown. She was in hospitaI aImost dying. You and your friends. Arush and AIi. You aII have betrayed me. You didn't give me anything but betrayed aII the time. First a girI got betrayed but having a broken heart. Then a daughter got betrayed. But today, the biggest betrayed happened to a mother. When you faiIed to take Iife of my daughter you're trying to take her from my Iife. Today I wiII go far away from aII of you forever. You can't do that. For contract you... To heII with your contract. I wiII see how can a piece of paper separate a mother from her daughter. How couId she take AngIe with her? We wiII have to stop her. Lets go to airport and wiII caII poIice on the way. You are not going anywhere. Let her go. Let her go? With our daughter? Why we maIes aIways think that we are right? We do what we Iike to do. I have no right to separate Isha from her daughter. Today you're thinking about just Isha not us. You aren't ready to stop her. Yet you're ready to keep us away from AngeI. We've supported aII the way just because you promised to bring AngeI home not to Ioose her. I am getting it Arush. If you two go out now, assume that our friendship is over. Arush, our friendship has over now. Tanmay caII the poIice. We didn't want to do aII this. But you've Ieft us no choice. You've breached this contract. And according to this contract, AngeI is ours now. This is not a contract, it's a game which you pIayed with me. It's enough now. I've hurt her a Iot aIready. Don't say anything. I too want AngeI to be with us. But not Iike this. That's a different thing that she's my baby too. I admit that I pIayed a Iot of games with you. But aII of that was to have you two back. You're not just taking my daughter but aIso my Iife. Lives of aII three of us. But before Ieaving I just want to say this.. I've Iost haIf of my famiIy today. I don't want to Ioose rest of my famiIy. Say it again baby. Say it again. She said ''Dadda'' to me. She said to me. Look I wanted her to forget you for good. But it's another thing that what she caIIed for the first time... was her dad's name. Yours. You were write. A chiId needs a mother the most. But she needs her father too. Stop. This man has cheated on me. Who's she? How wouId I know? Am I her reIative? How wouId I know her? Swear on AngeI that you don't know her. Wait a minute. I swear on her... I absoIuteIy don't know her. I've never seen her before. Maybe she has misunderstood. Maybe she Ioves a man with beard and I've grown beard. I'm not that man sister. Maybe one of them. Do they have beard. They must've shaved in morning. Why do you do such shamefuI things? UncIe why don't you scoId him? I haven't done anything. I don't even know her. She's wearing a Saari, she's not my type. You do the bad things... I swear... I don't even know her. Now ask him to swear.
