This is Eddie the Spaz coming to you this Friday night, and the countdown begins right now to a nonstop weekend Spaz-a-thon, with me, the Super Spaz. No sleep, no breaks, just me and you, my little rodents. Meanwhile, the weather just in from Mexico City, chilly tonight, hot tamale. - Yeah, baby. - Oh, dear God. Yes. Shit! Damn. Shit. Come on. Shit! Mary, honey, it's Mom. Dad's boss invited us to his boathouse for the weekend. Couldn't say no. We'll be back on Monday. Have a great weekend. Love you. Honey, parrots? Oh, don't forget to pick up the parrots tomorrow. Hello? Shit. Hello? Hi. I'm going to help you. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? What? What? Yes? Yes? You can hear me? I'm going to help you, okay? Get off me. Shit. Ladies and gentlemen... This morning, the town of Baltimore is trying to come to terms with 24 hours of... What the hell? All right... Murder, mayhem And aliens... Now here's Dick with the sports. Morning, ma'am. Can I help you? My bumper's dented, can you check it? Sure. Let me guess. Cell phone. That's quite a bit of work there. Can you leave it overnight? No, no, overnight, that doesn't work. Well, there's a garage over on First Street. You could try them. They're not gonna tell you nothing new, though. So, you want me to fix it or not? Listen, why don't you get out and just leave it to me? You know what, I'm gonna come back later. - Hi, Mom. - Mary? I've been trying to get you all morning. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's good. Why? - You sound a little funny. - Mom, I'm fine. Did you pick up Grandma's parrots at the airport? Uh, no, it's not a good day. I'll do it Monday, okay? Sweetheart, no, no, no, you really need to pick them up today. Right, yeah, okay. I'll go. I need you to pick them up right now, as a matter of fact. It's Saturday, and the place shuts at 1:00. Right, Mom, I know. Okay. I'll drop everything. I'm going, okay? Mary, you sure you're okay? Yeah. Sorry, it's just... It was a late night. All right, sweetheart, I love you. Love you, too. Fuck. Five more minutes and these babies were on their way to the tweet-tweet orphanage. Nice talking to you, too! Come on, come on, come on. - Sorry, my nerves are just a little raw. - Okay, sugar. Fuck. Come on. What's the best way to cover a small dent? Make a bigger one, right? Cover the first collision? Okay, Mary, you're losing it. You're losing it, okay? You're losing it, okay? Just... Fuck. Okay, just... Stop, Mary, just think. Think, okay? Okay? The trout season officially opened this weekend in Colombo. All the old hands will try their luck hooking a trophy specimen again this year. Me? I guess about the only thing I'll catch is the cold. Thanks, Julia. Speaking of cold, John, what's the weekend weather forecast? Sadly, the kindergarten teacher was reported missing by his wife Friday night. I gave him a kiss good night, and the next thing I know, he's gone. His cell phone, his watch, his shoes are still by the bed. Timothy, if you're out there, please come back, please. I love you. Andy misses you. We both miss you so, so much. Detectives were canvassing hospitals last night, providing Mr. Emser's description. Emser is a well-respected teacher for the past five years at the Colombo Elementary County School. ...little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went... Hey, where you been, man? You've been raging since last night, huh? Why didn't you call me? What's wrong with you? What, you got another guy in here? Huh? Yo, asshole, show your face! You wouldn't be that stupid. Look at you. - What? - Well, you look like shit. What's up with you? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? I know you. Something's up. What... Nothing. - Where'd you go last night? - Nowhere, nothing. It's just... - So you came back home? - Yes, I was at home. Okay, then why didn't you answer my calls? I just... I was just... I was... - Who were you with? - Stop it. Nothing. - Okay, so then why didn't you call me? - Nothing! Okay, I killed a man! All right, well, if it's just that, I know a great place upstate where we can go and no one will find him. I'm not joking. - Not a joke. - Enough, all right? It's not funny anymore. The schoolteacher, the... What are you talking about? The fucking... The schoolteacher! Why aren't you listening? I am listening to you. You're not making any fucking sense. The schoolteacher! His wife is, like, all over the news, like Elmer, Ester, I don't know, just someone! You're talking about the guy on TV, singing with the kids and the nursery rhymes and shit? - Huh? - Yes, I... I killed him. Okay. Okay, cut it out, all right? You know... What's the matter with you? That's not funny. I'm not... He was... He was in the garage and stuck to the car, and I hit him and I... I killed him. You hit him? Look at me. You're not fucking around with me, right? That's some heavy shit, Mary. I killed him. All right, just... Just... - I killed him. - Okay, okay, all right. Okay, okay. - I didn't see him and I killed him. - Okay, all right, all right. - Stop. Stop. Okay, okay. - I killed him! - I know, I know. - I killed him. - I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. - I know. Okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I just... I told him I was gonna help him, and then he just... He started attacking me, so I just... I hit him with a golf club. You hit him with a golf club? Oh, my God. You're fucking nuts. Don't yell at me. I'm not yelling at you, but I need to know what happened. All right, Mary? You want to know why? 'Cause you're gonna need my help. Trust me on that. I just... I just panicked. He was just lying on the bumper like some demented, dying animal, and he was just screaming at me, and he just... He started to, like, attack me, and he just wouldn't stop, and so, I just grabbed the first thing I saw and it was a golf club, and I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. You have to believe me. I did not mean it. I didn't mean it. Mary, of course I believe you. Okay? How long have we been going out? Two years, right? I believe every word that comes out of your mouth, okay? Okay? All right, so, what, this dude's still in the garage? Mary, if I'm gonna help you, you're gonna have to talk to me, okay? I buried him. You buried him? No, please. You have to understand, I was... I was so scared. I was so... I know I probably should have called the cops, but I didn't... I didn't know what to do. Please, Rick. - Please, just help me, just help me. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, I just need to think, all right? We need a plan. - What kind of plan? - One that works. Okay? One that we've gotta stick to, and it's gotta be rock solid. Okay, but what do we do? Okay, okay. No one, nowhere, no how, can know about this, okay? I know you want to vent right now, but the most important thing you can do - is keep your mouth shut. - I don't think I can. And then we move on one day at a time. No mouthing off, no loose ends, no haircuts, nothing that brings attention to yourself, Mary, and I mean nothing. This will pass, okay? I promise. This guy will get his 15 minutes of fame and then bam, he ain't shit no more. They'll find someone else to talk about. That's the plan. You on board? Okay, come here. You feeling better now? Huh? Come on. Come on. What? I heard something. - What? - Just go check it out. - I will, in a sec. Come on. - No, now. It's probably not... Fuck. - It's probably nothing. - Just check it. Rick? Rick? Rick? Rick? Fucking jerk, you're lucky I didn't stab you with this! Whoa! Whoa! Easy there, girl. That would be murder, Mary. Oh, fuck off. Come on. Hey, little fucker, what's up? Huh? Hey... Jesus! Little bitch. I'm sorry. Just relax, all right? Take some of your dad's meds, it'll take the edge off, and just go to bed. - I'll see you later. - Where are you going? I gotta go, Mary. You know, my head is pounding, I got to be up in, fuck, like, four hours. You know, I can't think straight. I gotta get some sleep. So do you, okay? Hello? Hello? Rick? - Mary? - Rick, I'm scared. - It's 3:30 in the fucking morning. - I can't help it, Rick. They know. There's a flyer. - A flyer? - Yes. It has his face and everything. They know. Mary, it's probably just a cop or a volunteer or something, all right? - That's what they do. - At 3:30 in the morning? Okay. These guys work around the fucking clock, all right? There's probably one under my door right now. Can't you come over? And do what, huh? What are we gonna do? Sit around and worry? Trust me, it's only gonna make things worse. Listen, Mary, all right? I'm counting on you. You need to calm yourself down. All right, sweetie? Yeah, I know, I know. You're probably thinking, "That's easy for you to say. " Fuck me, right? Yeah, but... Look, I'm in this with you now, all right? All the way. So go take another downer, you know? And if they're fives, take two, wash it down with some booze and get some sleep. All right? Now, I need you to hold yourself together for the next couple of days, all right? And don't let this flyer thing fuck with your mind, all right? It's just routine. Okay? Oh, yeah, and another thing, don't drink and dial, all right? That's how you get snared, talking shit on the phone. All right? - Hey. - Thanks. Hey, there, you children of the night, almost 36 straight hours into the Spaz-a-thon, and I'm feeling like a dead rat slept in my mouth. It's 3:45 EST. I'm not talking Eastern Standard Time, I'm talking Eddie the Spaz Time. Step out. You scared the shit out of me. Step out. Step out. Who taught you that? Grandma? Smart birds. - Mary, don't go crazy. - Crazy. - Shut up! - Crazy. Crazy. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Today, police divers searched the waters of Spring Lake without success for the kindergarten teacher who mysteriously vanished from his home, late Friday night. Police now believe his fragile mental state may be behind his disappearance. Emser was recently diagnosed with bipolar... Hear about the two kids who kissed in the fog? They missed. Oh, yeah! Whoo! Suffering from some serious sleep deprivation here, man, so don't hold me accountable for my actions. Stepped out of the studio for a little air intake. Ooh! Tell you, man, it is a real blanket of fog out there. Fuck! Fuck. Fuck! Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. - Mary, go back to bed. Fuck. - Rick. - Rick, the blanket. - What blanket? The blanket. I wrapped the body in a blanket, and if they find that, the fibers... They're gonna be on me in a second. I'm fucked. Rick! - You wrapped him in a blanket? - Yes! That was a dumb thing to do. - You gotta go back there and get it. - No. Uh-uh. No. No. I can't go back there. I can't. I get it. You want me to go back there with you, right? Yeah, well, right now I'd rather cut off a nut. Please, Rick. Please. - Where? - Okay. Right on Clover Road, all the way until you hit the woods. I will be there in 20. What? - Don't leave me hanging, all right, Mary? - Yeah, I won't. Promise. Fuck. Where is he? Rick, it's me. Where the hell are you? I can't believe this. Rick? Come on. Just fucking call. Fuck. Rick? Rick? Oh, fuck, Rick. Rick! Rick. This isn't... Rick. Rick, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Hello? Bloody Mary. Hello? Who is this? I'm gonna call the cops. Mary had a little lamb Stop it, please. Just... Little lamb Stop it. Just stop it. Oh, fuck! Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary. Hey, hey! This is full service only. Hey, fella.

Jesus Christ. What happened? Look at you. I thought you were dead. Oh, my God. You need to get to a hospital. Tim, do you hear me? Why don't you let me help you? I don't understand. What is going on? Why can't you tell me what happened? Please talk to me. Andy, do not come in here. Go to sleep. I'm not sleepy. Dad, can I stay up, please? Just a little bit longer, I'm not that tired. Can I go to the garage and get my laser gun? - No. - Daddy said no, now go to bed. - Did you brush your teeth? - Yes. Mom, is Dad gonna be okay? Yes, honey, now close your eyes. Please, Tim, take your medication. Why are you doing this to me? Fuck! All right, fine, be that way. It's because you didn't take it, this whole thing happened. God damn it. I can't stand it anymore. You don't want me to take you to a hospital, you're covered in blood, you disappear from the face of the earth, and you expect me to act normal? I saw you send the letter to the school. What are you talking about? I saw you fucking send it. Tim, you're imagining all this. It's in your head, Tim. What must they be thinking now? That I'm gonna come down there and slash their throats from ear to ear. I'll bet that's what they're thinking. That bitch couldn't kill me. Kill you? Who? That bitch. I'm calling the police. Andy? Andy, are you in there? Hello, this is 911 operator. Hello? Hello? Are you okay? Hello? Hello? Okay, we're sending the police. Mom! Andy, are you in there? Oh, my God. Who are you? My husband did this to you? Thank you. Thank you. Could you please untie me? - Yeah, yeah. I will. I will. - I'm really hurt. - Please, just... It really hurts. It hurts. - Okay, it's all right. - All right. Here, here. - Thank you. Thank you. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. My husband, he's not well. It's his head. I'm gonna call the police. No! Please. No, no! Don't! Could you hear the bones breaking when you hit me? Could you? - Could you? - No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't see you. I didn't see you. - It was an accident? - Yeah. - It was no accident. - It was. - It was. I'm sorry. - You... When you found me in your garage... When you found me in your garage, you stank. You stank. I'm sorry. You stank like alcohol. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm so sorry. No. I'm gonna do something really, really bad to you. No, please. No! I'm sorry! Stop it! Hail Mary. Say "Hail Mary. " Hail Mary. Hail Mary. Full of grace... Full of grace... You don't even know it. You don't even know it! You don't even know it! Because you don't believe. You don't believe.

Yeah, I can fix it. If I find the right match, I'll have it ready today. - Come back at 3:00. - Okay. Is there somewhere I can wash my hands? To the left. Hey, you okay? I don't think I need that bumper anymore.
