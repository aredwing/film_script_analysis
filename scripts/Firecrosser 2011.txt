What's wrong with you? Help me! So, is he alive? Stop! She's got wolf cubs! (speaking Tatar) Listen to me! You mustn't kill the pilot. Because we love each other, and I have to bear him a son. Hey, pal, we're late for the lights-out time! I don't get it! She took the shuriken with her bare hands! When It's spinning, the temperature reaches 6 000 degrees! It's all about love! Degrees have nothing to do with this. You can't walk here for free. Have you got money? 50 copecks I also have one rouble.

Lyubov Anvarovna! Do I know you? I would like to wish you on your birthday, Comrade Karimova. The head of the special department has to know everything about the full strength. Let me introduce myself... Stepan Shulika. Can I give you a lift? Thank you! Please, don't you be shy, I'm talking in a neighbourly way. You don't worry, Iwon't lose my way. Cadet Dodoka, we have found this at the site of occurrence, acquaint yourself with it. I've come to rescue you, noodle. Stepan! I will serve in the Army here, I've been advanced. They entrusted me with the special department... I brought this, as if I had known that I'd meet you. Take it. So you came from home! They gave me a ten day holiday, so I went home straight away. Mmm, and how is the village, and everybody? You eat, eat... Your father was imprisoned. At your home the hiding place was found, empty. Father knew, he knew everything before, what would happen next. All right. I've got to go. You'll get out, and we'll talk. I've got three more days. What did you think to get for AWOL? Orderly officer! Lyubov Anvarovna! Why didn't you sign up for our cycle group?

Abicyclist consists of two parts: a huge kind heart and... Let me go! I am getting married! Whom to? To a Colonel. But all our Colonels are married. Lyubov Anvarovna! Dear! You took it all wrong! I mean... I wanted to say... Let me explain everything! This is myfriend Ivan. War. Lyubov Karimova to Ivan Dodoka Lyuba, finally I ventured to write to you. I regret my rash action deeply. On that last peaceful morning of our Soviet Motherland I went off my heat. But I admit, as a man, I don't regret it. Your image doesn't leave me since I first saw you. I trust paper with what I had to tell you at our first meeting. First time in my life I experienced a feeling that blazed up and I lost my mind. I love you, Lyuba! And I can do anything for you. To live without you is torture. Your Stepan. Petka, keep a seat for me! Comrade Colonel, report. To the front. Again? You'll go to the front, and who will teach them to fly? Don't come to me with this no more. Comrade lieutenant, Ivan Orestovich, I was removed from flights. They are ging to transfer me. you are said to teach a rail to fly. Follow me, double-quick! Is it a battle plain? You were removed! My grandfather was flying a plough astride. How is it? He was a Cossack wizard. Sit here! You know there were such Cossacks, cast-a-spell-over-Cossacks, neither bullets nor sabres harm him, and they could fly anything. Close your eyes. Without sails, from the ground, take me up to the skies, hey, hoy, tailless hound. What? Without sails, from the ground, take me up to the skies, hey, hoy, tailless hound. Close your eyes. Without sails, from the ground, take me up to the skies hey, hoy, tailless hound. You have to repeat this 17 thousand 3 times... hey, hoy, tailless hound... and you'll be able to fly either a plough and a fighter. Comrade lieutenant, do you also believe in God? That's all for today. You may leave now. Post. Stepan Vasilievich, may I go? You may go. Hello, Stepan. We can only be friends. I love an other man, an I don't need anybody else. Stepan, could you help me to find Ivan? My dear Ivan, I don't know what to think! At any free minute I write a letter to you, but I don't receive a reply. I want to hear from you so much. Of course you are at the front already, otherwise my letters would find you at the military school. It seems an eternity since I saw you last. Lyuba, my dear, all my letters are unanswered. They don't let me go from the school, but I have thought everything over. I will be at the front soon, and not a single fascist bomb will fall on the ground where I will fly. Every time when a wounded pilot is brought the world stands still, is it you or not? I reread the only letter from you... about the storks that live on your house. As soon as front draws back, I'll write to your home. ...Maybe your family knows, where you are and how you are ... The papers are ready. I've told you not to come here. But... you didn't come yesterday... You know, this is no time now, Nadya. What do you mean, no time? And what? I have to wait for you till the victory? You don't have to wait for me at all! Dear Lyuba! I cannot find Ivan. May I come in, Comrade Major? Come in... It's about Dodoka. What's that? The flight route. The route of what flight? The flight route to the front, Comrade Major. Maybe we should let him go? Or he can ruine it. I know Ivan from my childhood. I'll fly away he said, as soon as he has enough petrol he'll fly. Desertion to the front. He says, I'll fly by myself if you won't let. Are you telling me that as to the special office head or as Ivan's friend? He'll fly. He won't have time. We've got an order: those who can fly must go to the front, those who can't will stay at the rear. Dismissed. We need to tell your father. He'll kill us. He won't touch us. And your Stepan... Stop crying, enough of bearing from him, you must act. Smoked? And why are you crying? What happened? Nothing, father, don't. Is it because of Stepan? Tell me, Stepan? Too much time at the rear, little bastard? I regret Iwanted to take him with me. Wipe your snot. We'll find you another fiance. I don't want another one, I want this one! This one... let him smell powder! Nikolay, Germans cluched at the American. They will crash him! This is Guerard! His board is the nineth! True, they'll crash Guerard! Guerard! Move right! How to say right? Guerard! Move right! How to say right? I studied German! Then be quiet! Cover me! Attacking! Without sails, from the ground... My leg hurts, I can't walk, help me My leg! Shit, must have broken... Look! He flew to the front with his bike. What pricks Americans are! It's pressed with a box. It's pressed with a box. Comrade Colonel, if you allow. Speak. Just before landing two Messerschmitts attacked us. They mauled the American. Nikolay crashed one of them. I know. The American came, he was looking for you. He is as black as soot. He'd better be a night bomber pilot, not a transport work. Girls, feed him. He is one of our heroes. Comrade Colonel, would you let me? I saw my house. Not far from here. This is my home village. Tchernechy Yar. You will go home-but after the victory. We have to fly further. Meteorologist won't let you out. Let's talk about it in the evening. Now you go to the medical unit. There and back. I seem to be safe. You are, but your friend has hurt his leg. Dear Vanya, it's noisy here today-one plane after another. They all are rushing to the west, like storks, flock after flock. So am I hurrying to write to you... Luyba! Luyba! Put him down, carefully... Sign it, we are getting married. Comrade Captain, we've got to wait. Comrade Colonel, if you allow. Enjoy your meal. At ease. And what's that? Acity in China. Called Fuzhou... Have you been there? Not me, one artist, a blind one. Ablind artist? Well he wasn't blind at first but then... Behind the village -a night, behind the mountain -a daylight, at the meadow- A stump, flooded a spit, covered the moon.

We will act through Red Cross, meanwhile I am completing the formalities about adopting. Vanya is adult now, he understands everything. Uncle Kolya? Can you bring papa from Canada on your plain? Not by MiG. We need an other plain for this. You will have to wait, Ivan. I will. Thank you. That's enogh. Spare the wings. (Speaking Indian.) Don't forget us, Ivan! My mother beat me with a birch root so that Iwon't walk with a young recruit! And I walked until cocks-crow... Without sails, from the ground, take me up to the skies, hey, hoy, tailless hound. Hey, be quiet. Americans are all over here. Wow! The hostile grew tall, more than 2 metres! Comrade?! Comrade Indian! Comrade Indian Are you local resident? (Speaking Ukrainian) Of this place. And where is the post here? Two miles away. I have to... telegraph, urgently. Comrade Colonel! You telegram. May I go? Go. Yes sir!

I don't believe you! You think I believe you You promised me a son, and now when he is found... Don't bite me, you fool! Telegram. Anybody home? A telegram for you. Ivan, my son, finally, I can write a letter to you. I will try to pass it with help of Guerard, uncle Kolya and Smirnov. I don't know, if you get the letter or not, its way will be long and unsafe. I don't know, where we'll live. In our house in Tchernechy Yar or here among the Indians, who saved me and restored my hopes. Indians say, happiness has two halves. You and I have a long way to the second half. You know, I had everything. I had friends, enemies, and a wife. Long ago I had an ancestral home. Today I have an old plain, where I live, but I will not settle a son in it. Let they bloody try! (Speaking Indian)The time has come to give you a name. The tribal chief addressed himself to the guests in Ukrainian. He said his Indian name - "The-one-who-has-gone-through-fire"/ "FireCrosser", and the name given by his parents - Ivan Datsenko. Ivan Datsenko was a front-line pilot. He made 21 operation flights. He is a Hero of the Soviet Union.
