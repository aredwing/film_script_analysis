Well, you can't. I guess you're mad at me now 'cause I don't want to. No. I thinkyou're right. I wouldn't make love to me either ifl wereyou. No. I mean, I wanna make love toyou, but-- I don't know. I'm glad you won't. - Men are insane. - They're the scourge ofthe earth. Look. Ifl had a daughter, I wouldn't let one near her. Okay?. As a matter offact, if someone like myself came to my door... to take my daughter out, I think I'd get a gun. There's plenty oftime. I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm not leavin' New York. You were so! You flirt with them. Everysingle time we go out,y,ou flirt-- Oh. Sorry. Don't stop. Don't stop. Do you know how long it's been since this woman's done that?. Oh, Ron! J ust a second. Come back here! No. We never really got along. His friends tell me he's a great guy, but-- He's really not bad. It's just that he's-- I guess he was just disappointed in his only son and all that kind ofthing. - What did he wantyou to be?. - Him. Oh. How aboutyou?. What did you do when you got here?. Did you know anybody?. No. I didn't know anybody. All I did know was that I wanted to be an actress, a good one... and where I come from, ambition is a rather dirtyword. So one day I packed my bags, and the next day I was here. Hmm. - What?. What areyou thinking?. - I don't believeyou took that money. You can't believe it. I can't believe it either. I mean, it was right there, and I needed the money, and, um-- I still don't believe that I did it myself, but I always do things... on the spur ofthe moment, and-- What's the matterwith the horse?. She's old. But, you know, I've had her for a long time. Oh! Zack, I've gotta get my messages, okay?. This is Milton. You got the final callback for Carnaby Street. - Zack! - It's 10.:00 this morning at the Palace. - 10:00?. Oh, no! - Debbie, this is Milton. Where are y,ou? - It's 2:30.

You should have had the part. - You were better. - No. Come on! - Forget it. - Can't they see me tomorrow?. - It was a final callback. - You must be able to-- There's nothing I can do. I've had it with you. Good-bye. Okay. - What happened?. - It's cast. Really?. - There'll be other parts. - There won't be other parts! You don't understand. I've been here eight months. How many parts do you think there are... for an Australian who's neverworked a day in this town?. Oh, no! Charlie, take a look. - Not at the apartment. - Down on the street. Where is it?. It's apartment-- It's apartment eight. Hey, wait a minute. Who areyou?. - What doyou want?. - Yeah. Who areyou?. - What doy,ou want? - I wantyou to get what's coming toyou. What doyou want?. A cut?. How much?. I wantyou, sunshine. I likeyou. I want him. I thinkyou're despicable. Whatnow, Charlie? Well, you can't do anything. He's forbidden us to use our powers. - That's becauseyou abuse them. - Boys. - Relax. Eat a marshmallow. - Forget the marshmallows. Hey. I understand missing chances. Mywhole life is a series of missed chances. Believe me. There'llbe otherparts. There won't be other parts. It's different for you. - How?. - You can createy,our own inventions. I can't create my own parts. My inventions?. They're probably destroyed right now. - I can't go home and find out. - Well, at least you have a home. Because ofy,ou, I was evicted. I don't have any,money,. I don't have anywhere to live. You got more than me. You got all this stuff. Oh, all this stuff?. Why don't you take it then?. Take all this! Take my armoire, TV and stereo and sell it. - I don't want it. - Suddenlyyou have ethics?. - Yes, I have ethics. - What ethics?. I keep trying. That's my ethic. I stay one step ahead of everybody. Look. I don't wait for anybody to give me anything. Hey, things aren't going that well for me either. I mean, I'm a gimmick man. I got novelties I make... and most ofthem really suck. But I'll tell you something. One day, I'm gonna do something I'm definitely proud of. That's my ethic: to keep goin'... which is exactly what I should do right now. Why couldn't they calm down and talk?. They forgot theywere having a wonderful time. - Where's the money,? - I don't have it. Get her! Where's my,money,? It's gone! What do you mean, it's gone? I want my money! - I've got some money. - Get it. Cover him. I like your doorbells. Come on. Ten dollars?. That's it. Didn'tyou guys get any at the Plaza?. Boss, I think he's tellin' the truth.

You too. - Hey, Sarge, you gonna tell 'em about the reward?. Thankyou, sir. There will be a reward. No. Please, officer. I'm simply doing my duty as a good citizen. Come on. Come on. Give it up, Zack. I mean, they fired her because she flirted with you. You came awaywith nothing. She took the money. We figured that out. But ify,ou'll testify against her, we'll chargey,ou as an accessoryto the robbery. I'll talk to the D.A., who's a friend, and I might be able to gety,ou off!on probation. Now, this is the last time I'm gonna make this off!er, Zack. What do you say?. Just what I 've been saying. I don't know what this is about. All right. I 'll talk to her. And just watch how fast she makes a deal. Mmm-mmm. Okay,, Debbie. Come on. - Hey, what you doin' with her, man?. - Hey,, wherey,ou takin'her? You said before you didn't know Zack before he came in to rob the bank. I didn't say I knew the man who robbed the bank. - We know it was Zack. - Then what do you want from me?. Shut up over there! Debbie, I wanna give you a chance... to refute the allegations that Zack made againstyou. Look, I've seen police shows, and I know howyou try and turn people against one another. It's not gonna workwith me. What you got?. That Beazley fella says we should ask Zack about the special effects robbery. All right. Just turn around and stare at her. Man, she threw you to the sharks! We got more than we needed. She didn't tell you anything. You know, it's funny. I mean, the police had given up... on trying to figure out who pulled that special effects robbery. on trying to figure out who pulled that special effects robbery. You know, I meet women like her every day,. She didn't care abouty,ou; only,the money,. I just hope you didn't have any plans for the next 10 years. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - You want to make a deal?. - Yes. - Then you tell me the truth right now. - Fine. - Good. - All right. She did take the money, okay?. I went to herwindow at the bank. She gave me what I thought was the money... but when I got home, that bag was filled with envelopes andpapers. - She took it. - Okay. Come on, Debbie. Now, look. We don't wanna put you away, Debbie. We want him. He thinks I made some kind of a deal. I didn't. - Now, I can get 'em to reduce the charges againstyou to embezzlement-- - No. "No"?. Are you crazy?. I'm off-- I'm offering you probation. I goty,ou eitherway,, but ify,ou identifyhim,y,ou don't go tojail. I've got nothing more to say. Debbie. Now, the next 10y,ears ofy,our life are on the line. Believe me. You don't wanna go to jail, be stuck behind bars, treated like an animal. And when you get out, you'd be deported. Eitherway, you'll never see him again. Look. Why,arey,ouso willing to sacrificey,our entire life... - fora guy, who doesn't give a damn abouty,ou? I don't believe that. Look. He turned against you! Aw. Okay. Come on. J ust come on. Claire! You're a fool. But it's not fair. He wasn't going to betray her until Beazley interfered. The devil's alway,s around to tempt man. Zack shouldn't have lost faith. But she didn't. She's going tojail rather than testify against him. That's love. Even though she's furious, she won't turn on him. That's a sacrifice. That's half a miracle. - I want a whole miracle. - He'll come around. I know he will. Give us more time. Please give us one more week. - I guarantee he'll come around. - You're guaranteeing me?. Sorry. Tomorrow's the last night. At midnight, mankind is a memory. Where is the assistant district attorney?. Does he think we have all day?. Where did Charlie go?. He said he'd be right back. I don't know where he went. Doyou know where he went?. No. I don't know. Your Honor, may I approach the bench?. The cassette now is gone. Someone must have broken into the room and taken it. Hey, Debbie. I guess we got lucky that tape got lost, huh?. - I was lucky. You didn't need luck. - What are you talkin' about?. I told you I'd never break myword. What doyou mean?. It's just a shame thatyou can be tricked, isn't it, Zack?. Come, now. It was a valiant effort. Well, she did come through for him, didn't she?. But to get him to perform a great sacrifice... Well, that was unrealistic, wasn't it?. All right. Let's drop the act. He wouldn't flood the world. I mean, where would everybody go?. You suppose he'd give them to me?. I told you. He's going to bring everyone up. He's going to end life. It'llbe like man never existed, because no one will be here to rememberhim. Except you. When I think that she risked everything for me-- She could've gone to jail. - She's incredible. - Sounds like a beautiful lady. - Doyou love her?. - Yes, I do love her.

Get him back there. - What areyou gonna do, man?. - Hey. Back behind the barricade. That's my girlfriend in there. What areyou gonna do?. Wait to hear his demands. Oh,just wait?. That's it?. What doyou suggest we do?. Go in there with guns blazing?. Come on. Back behind the barricade, please. Charlie. Why is it Ruth and I are the only ones who give a damn?. Where have the two ofyou been?. - We went up to talkwith him. - You did?. We beggedhim formore time. He saidno. Well, he wants $11.48 and a chopper to fly him to Newark. Eleven dollars and 48 cents?
