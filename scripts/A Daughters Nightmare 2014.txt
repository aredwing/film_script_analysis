Considerate to his older brother Cameron, loving father and friend to his daughter Ariel, devoted husband and life partner to his wife Dana. Jack Morgan will be forever missed. # No regrets, # I'll watch over you. # Live on for me, # my loves. # Dry your tears, # I'm where I should be. # I'm watching you from above. # Bye, Dad. There's a lot of people here. I didn't think everyone would drive up from Spokane. Yeah, it's nice. Well, your daddy was a very easy man to like. Yeah. Wasn't he, Cam? That he was. I'm really gonna miss him. Me too, baby. Hey, can you open the car? Hey! Your doctor said no smoking! What part of that didn't you get? Thank you for folding that. You ok? Yeah, I'm fine. You know, I don't have to go this semester, I can stay. I can stay here with you and we can hang out. Don't you be silly. Besides, what did we promise your father? That we would go on living. That's right. Which is why I'm going to learn how to fly solo. Ok, well I'll leave that dress here to keep you company. I might take this scarf. No, I like that scarf! Give it to me! Oh! Glad you're here. I thought maybe you'd changed your mind again. No, I tried but she wouldn't let me. Can you take those, too? Thank you. Wow! Yeah, it's all ah, you know, school things. Good morning. Well, does she have to bring all her shoes? Oh, thank you. I hope it's strong enough. I'm sure it is. How're you doing? Yeah, I'm fine. Aw, you. It's your big day. I'm going to come home, like, every weekend. Ok? Honey, I'm fine. I know, but I think I should. We should plan some stuff, and we'll have some adventures or something. Alright, I'll look forward to it. Alright. I'm here if you need me, you know? I know you are. Just call me and I'll be here, ok? Ok. Alright, I love you. I love you. Alright, get in there before Uncle Cam has another coronary. Oh dear. Agh! Agh! Ah, it hurts! Ahhhh! Bye, baby, love you! Hey, Brooks! Now, the type of psychiatric disorder we're talking about, it forms at a sub-conscious level... Why do you keep saying that? I'm not like that! Adam, tell him! Ben, Dr. Schwartstein's trying to help you. Please listen to him. Ben, listen. I was not suggesting that you are in control of these behaviours. Or that you've been dishonest with us. Your mother, she was sick for a long time. Years. And after her death, you've been experiencing mood swings and had trouble sleeping. Once in a while. And how often would you say you've been hearing the voices in your head? Not too often. Ben, sometimes when a person's normal coping methods become overwhelmed, they begin to express psychological distress physically. Here, you can read this at home. Now, the type of psychiatric disorder we're talking about, it forms a sub-conscious level. You wouldn't even be aware of it. Give this to someone who needs it. Ben, hold on! Ben! Adam, I would get Ben into treatment as soon as possible. His symptoms indicate that he's suffering from at least one dissociative disorder, and that points to a more chronic and severe psychopathology. Ok. Ok, thank you. Good luck. Ben! Ben, hold on! No, he thinks I'm crazy! No, he doesn't. He's talking to me like I'm some kind of psycho! Wait, no, no. It's one opinion. That's why we went to him, right? For another opinion? I'm working at a hospital again, I will get you the best medical help available, I promise. I'm here for you, ok? Ok. Come on, let me get you something to eat. Ok. You forgot this. Ow! Sorry! So you say that now... Well, you're the one texting. Let's start over. Hi! I'm Ariel Morgan. Hey. It's nice to meet you. Ariel Morgan, good to meet you. I'm late for class. Ok... what's your name? Jack. Dana. Hey, Cam. Hey! So, it's Friday again. I am well aware of that. What's the verdict? It's been eight and a half weeks, and you haven't come out. Come on, you can't wallow around in there forever. Life marches on, with or without you. Come on, Dana, are you still there? Yeah. Where else would I be? Listen, I've got my last surgery at 6:00, why don't I swing by and pick you up? There'll be folks like you at this meeting, people you can talk to. Dana? I'll see you when you get here. Hey, slow down, slow down. Ariel Morgan! Hi, yeah. Look, I'm sorry if I was rude this morning, I had to drop a course. You were a little rude. I'm Ben Woods, I'm a freshman. Hi, Ben Woods. This is, uh, sorry. This is Adam, my stepfather. Hi. Ariel. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So, uh, where you off to? I'm just going to the bus, going home for the weekend. So... Ridgewood. Oh, nice. That's where we're going. You're going to Ridgewood? You wanna hop in? Uh, yeah. That would be great! Hop in. Ok. Are you from the Ridgewood Ariel? Uh, no, I'm from Spokane actually. We moved here last summer. We're from Seattle. Oh, cool, what made you move to Ridgewood? I had a job opportunity at the hospital. How does your family like it here? It's alright, it's really just my dad's hometown, but it's just me and my mom now. My dad passed away this summer. I'm sorry for your loss. You must have a lot of family here. Not really, all my dad's relatives don't really live here anymore, and my mom is from Georgia. Oh, your mother's from the South? Yeah, Savannah. But her parents died when she was young and she moved away after that so there's no real connection there anymore. She doesn't even really have an accent. It's just me and my mom and my uncle Cam. Starting over is never easy. Yeah. How's she doing now? Uh, she's alright. She's trying this new grief counseling thing tonight at my church, so hopefully that'll help get her out more. There you go. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you for the ride. No problem. I'll see you at school? Yeah. Ok. Have a good weekend! Yeah, you too. Can you get that? Really? New pipe? Yes I did. Can you let your mother know I'm here? Mother, Uncle Cam's here! I could have yelled at her, myself. Nobody needs to yell, I'm right here. You ready? Yes, thank you for coming to get me. I will be in the car. I will be back around 8:00. Bye, have fun. Thanks, babe. Love you. Love you, too. How do you sleep at night? I'm tougher than you. You missed the introductions, but why don't you tell us who you are? Um, alright. Um, my name is Dana Morgan. Oh, we're on a first name basis here. Ok, uh... Dana. I grew up in Savannah, but I've lived in Spokane for the last 20 years with Jack. Jack was my husband. We moved to Ridgewood last year with our daughter, Ariel, right after he was diagnosed with lung cancer. We were going to beat it. Jack died this summer. How do you feel about Jack's death? I uh... I feel like I'm still sharing my life with him. Nothing's changed. Except he's not here. Who else feels like Dana? You'd rather be anywhere but here. Excuse me? You don't seem the group type. Am I that obvious? Maybe not to everyone. I'm Adam. Dana Morgan. No last names, remember? You're right, I do hate groups. Normally I would agree with you, but in this circumstance I think talking helps. Your daughter told me about this group. Ariel? My stepson Ben goes to school with here. Oh, wow. We recently moved from Seattle. I was in a group there. So when did your wife pass away? Karen died eight months ago. Everyone take your seats, please. We should get back. Boo! I was taking a little power nap. I could see that. So, how did it go? You know what? You were right. You know him? His wife died eight months ago. Sure looks broken up about it. Really? Cameron Morgan? I'm just looking out for you. Well? He didn't look that broken up! So other than the work load, you're enjoying it? Well, college kinda is the work load. But I'm doing pretty well in chemistry and anatomy, but that's just because I spent all those summers in Uncle Cam's clinic. Physics is challenging. Well, you're a smart girl. You're gonna figure it out. Oh, hey. I forgot to tell you... I met the father of a friend of yours last weekend. I think he said his son's name is Ben? Adam? Ben's stepfather? Oh, that's right, he did say stepson. Where'd you meet Adam? At that group that Cam took us to. Your grief group? What was Adam doing at your grief group? He lost his wife. Ben's mom. He didn't tell you that? No, I didn't know that. That's kinda weird. Why is that weird? Well, just 'cause they drove me home last weekend and I was talking about you and dad the whole time but they didn't really say anything. Well, Adam said he had you to thank for telling him about the group. He was very appreciative. Hmm. And, you know, maybe Ben's just not that open, right? Hey. Hey. You uh... you want to go for a walk with me? A walk? Right now? Yeah, you want to go for a walk? Shh! What? That could get you in trouble. What? What you did back there with that geek. Well, my father taught me to be a very strong, independent woman who can defend herself. Nice. Ooh, I like your socks, by the way. Do you always mis-match, or just today? Uh, it comes with doing my own laundry, I guess. I like it. Thanks. So I'm hoping to get into vet school after my undergrad. I worked in my uncle Cam's clinic for about five summers now, and I like it but I have to get at least a 3.5 GPA if anybody's even gonna look at me. You know Adam tried to be a doctor? Really? Yeah. I mean, the guy knows more about medical stuff than most hospitals but I don't know. His grades weren't good enough. What did he end up doing? Well, now he's an ER nurse at Ridgewood General. until I finish school. That's nice. Hey, did he tell you that he actually went to that grief group thing I was talking about at my church? Really? Yeah, he met my mom there. No. Small world. Oh, I'm sorry about your mom, by the way. I didn't know. Yeah. Yeah, so am I. Shoot, you know what? I think I have a chem lab right now. Yeah, ooh, right now. I have to go, I'm sorry. Ok, great. I'll see you later. Bye. Hey Ariel. Hi! Hey, little man. I didn't know you guys lived around here. Yeah, we're just a couple blocks away. Is your mom around? Uh, no. She's actually out grocery shopping, but she should be back soon if you want to wait for her. Yeah, sure. Take a seat. So my mom said you guys met at that grief counseling group. Yeah, yeah we did. Listen, thanks for telling me about that group. Yeah. You know, it's really hard to talk about that stuff in front of Ben, he's just so sensitive. Oh. I didn't know you were here, or I would have brought you a coffee. Oh, that's alright, I'll just drink hers. She's not gonna miss it. So what's his name? Max. What's wrong with him? Old age. It happens to the best of us. Really? He sounds more asthmatic to me. You should get him checked out. Wow. You should be a vet. Well, I'm trying to be. I hope you have good grades. Yeah, I'm trying to do that, too. But physics is really killing me. I gotta study every night if I just want to pass. So was my mom expecting you, or...? No, this is just a random drop by. You know, after what I've been through and what she's going through I thought maybe I could provide a bit of a road map for her, you know? Oh. It's been eight months for you, is that right? 246 days to be exact. Yeah, mom's not really doing so well. She kinda just hangs around at the house. Well, you know Ariel, people grieve in their own ways. Yeah, I guess. Hey! Hey, you two. Hope you don't mind me just popping by. I had a great conversation with your daughter. Oh, I didn't realize you lived so close. Yeah, they're just up the street. Can I give you a hand with the groceries? Um, that'd be very nice. Ok. Wow. What're you doing, feeding the Olympic team? Hey, Adam brought you a coffee but I drank it for you. Oh, that was nice of you. You need a hand with all this stuff? Nah, we're good. Just have a seat. Ok. Mom, you bought dad's hot sauce again. Do you want me to just put it in the fridge, or...? It takes some time getting used to it. Being single again. I'm not very good at this. I liked being a couple, you know? I knew what my life was about, about hot sauce and medical appointments. It's alright, we'll figure it out. Ben's having a hard time coping. I thought a change of scenery would help, but he's had a real difficult time losing his mom. Difficult how? Like, in school or something? I think he's suffering from psychological stress. I'd sleep a lot better if he was living at home with me. He didn't want to live at home? No. In fact, he was adamant about staying on campus. More freedom, you know. Yeah. Ok. I'm going to take Ariel's advice and get Max to the vet. Take him to Cam's clinic. Oh yeah, my uncle's a vet, you should take him there. That's ok, the clinic next to me takes walk-ins. Okay. I got this, I was trained well, I take my own garbage. See you, Ariel. Bye. Hello, Max. You and I are gonna go to the vet. Ok? Dana, it's none of my business, but Ariel mentioned she's having trouble in school. Really? She told me she's doing fine. Apparently not. It sounded like she needed more time to study but was feeling obligated to come home on the weekends to keep you company. I had no idea. I'll see ya. Hey! Uh, so you want to go get a mani-pedi or something? Or go see a movie? There's a few good ones out. You know what, honey? Would you mind if we skipped this weekend? What, you don't want to get a mani-pedi with me? No, it's not that, I just think maybe I could use some alone time. Yeah, ok, sure. That's fine. And, you know, it would give you a chance to catch up on your studies. You hardly brought any books home this weekend. Yeah, that's true. I need to do that. Hey, you ok? Yeah, I just feel like crap all of a sudden. The flu's going around, I think I may have gotten it. Well, do you want to go lay down? You feel pretty warm. Uh, no actually. Can you just drive me back to school? Yeah, of course. Ok, thank you. No, I think that's a good idea, honey. I do. Ok, well why don't you just check in with me before you go to bed, ok? Ok, bye bye. Hi! Hi. I just thought no sense in us both wasting our gas. You going to group tonight? I am. Hop aboard. Well, that was very thoughtful of you. Evening, folks. Hey, Cameron, what're you doing here? I left work early to drive you to your meeting. Apparently you've made other plans. Adam was kind enough to offer me a lift. And I do have my own car, you know. Adam, this is Cameron, my brother-in-law. Jack's brother. Cameron. Hello. I'll see you later, Cam. Sorry. I hope you like country music. You kiddin' me? Is there a Southern girl who didn't? My daughter, she loves it even more than I do. Dana, what would you say if we went for dinner instead? Adam, I don't really think that's appropriate. I know, I'm not trying to come on to you. It's Karen's birthday today, the first since... I thought it would help. I don't feel like being in a group. It would be doing me a favour. Thank you for doing this, it's almost over. I should thank you. The food here is amazing! It's unbelievable. Jack and I didn't really get out much in the last year. Here. Oh, no. No more for me. This happens to be the finest wine in the region. You see those grapes out there? Squished in this bottle. They died for us? They died for us. Ok, one drop. What a sacrifice. That's good. Ok. I can't remember the last time I had more than a glass. Yeah, well we tend to give up a number of things when we have spouses who are ill. I suppose that's true. So you never did tell me... how did Karen die? Well, Karen had a number of issues. Stomach infections, joint inflammation, kidney trouble. I took care of her and Ben through most of our marriage. Dana, I haven't... I haven't told very many people this, but Karen died of an overdose. I'm so sorry. Painkillers. She took so many pills, Dana, it was... she would take all her pills and then she would forget she took them and then she would take more. And I would try to warn her, but... I was, um... I was working the night shift, and I came home in the morning and Ben was in the living room watching game shows, so I went into the bedroom, and I didn't know that she wasn't sleeping until I kissed her. And then I just sat on the edge of the bed and I thought... "my wife is dead". Dana, are you ok? This wine just went right to my head. Can you excuse me? Yeah, of course. Hello, Ariel. Hello? Who's this? Adam, Ben's stepfather. Uh, why are you answering my mother's cell phone, Adam? Well, your mom is in the ladies room, so... Uh, really? I thought you guys would be done with your meeting by now. Well, yeah, we would have been, but we decided to play hooky and go for dinner instead. Would you like me to have her call you in the morning? Uh, no, I wanted to talk to her tonight, so I'm just gonna call her later. Ok, I'll tell her you called. Bye, Ariel. Bye. Hello? Hi! Just gonna walk right by? Uh, sorry, I... I didn't see you there. What's going on? How come you're here? I thought you went home on weekends? Uh, yeah, I was going to, but um... I wasn't feeling good so I stayed. You got time for a coffee break? Yeah! Ok. Hey! That's my coffee. Is it good? It is good. This is funny. This is, uh, what our parents are doing right now. Really? Yeah, your stepdad's having dinner with my mom. I didn't know that. Yeah, I thought it was kinda weird, actually. I didn't know that. Hey, you never really talk about your mom much. What was she like? Um... I didn't really know her. Um, she was always sick. Sleeping. Yeah. Adam was the one who was always there for me. He took care of me since I was, like, ten. Where's your real dad? He took off when I was little. Never left a forwarding address and my mom, she never sent one either. That must have been really hard growing up with your mom sick all the time. My dad was sick, too, but he didn't get that way until the very end. Yeah. I think that's why Adam and I get each other. His mom died of TB when he was a kid. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Yeah, it's been rough. Yeah, I'm sure. It makes sense. What makes sense? It makes sense that it's been rough. Adam told me you'd been having trouble adjusting to college and it makes sense with your mom and everything, that's terrible. What else did Adam say about me? Um, nothing. Just that you were having trouble adjusting to school. That's totally normal. What? What're you looking at? Excuse me. May I get you something else, sir? No. My friend has been in the ladies room for a long time. Would you mind checking on her? I'll go right this minute. Thank you. Ma'am? Are you doing alright in here? Ma'am? Oh god! og barking in the distance] y! Finally, where have you been? Hey, I'm sorry honey, I didn't get your messages until right now. Really? I've been calling you since last night. Why was your phone off? It wasn't. It went straight to voice mail. Uh, what were you doing at dinner with Adam last night? I thought you guys had your meeting. Oh, it was really sad. Yesterday was his wife's birthday. How did you know we went out, anyway? Oh, I called you at the restaurant and Adam... Oh, you know what babe? That's the door. Can I call you right back? Hi. Hi. What's all this? You weren't doing so well at the end of the night and I thought you'd appreciate a homemade breakfast. Yeah, what happened last night? May I? Yeah. Yeah, come inside. So where did you learn to make grits? Libby. Who's Libby? My first wife. She taught me all about southern cooking. Come on. She was the reigning Miss Texas. Are you serious? Mmmhmm. You married Miss Texas? Mmmhmm. Wow. I thought I struck gold. She was killed in a car accident shortly after we married. That' awful. I had no idea you'd been through this twice. Well, enough about my depressing past. Bon apptit, y'all. Oh. Cheese grits! I'm sorry, I just... I don't have much of an appetite today. Just one? I can't. You'll feel better. I'm sorry, I can't. I just feel like I've been hit by a tractor. Ok, alright. Well, red wine will do that. That was weird, I feel like I didn't have more than two glasses. Hope I didn't do anything too embarrassing. Does waking up on the ladies room floor count? I didn't. Oh, I did. Our waitress helped me get you to the car. Oh lord. How did I get undressed and into bed? Ok, I was a perfect gentleman. Oh my god. I'm a registered nurse, Dana. You haven't got anything I haven't seen before. I'm so embarrassed. Please don't be. Ok? Alright, enough said, this will be ready when you want it. You must try my coffee. I'm quite proud of it. It's good. I'm usually more of a tea drinker, but this is good. You look like you could use some rest. I'm gonna get out of your hair, ok? I got it, you stay. You rest. You heal. Thank you. What'd you forget? Oh, hey. It's you. Come on in. Ok. I'm sorry, I thought it was someone else. Sorry I'm disappointing you. I just stopped by to see how you're getting on. Oh, I am gettin' on. Well, I've been in surgery since 5:00 am. Retrievers with hip dysplasia. You drinking this? That's a good looking breakfast. Are you eating that? No, I can't even look at food today. Adam brought that over. Really? Is he in the breakfast delivery business now? He knew I wasn't feeling well, he was being neighbourly. I'm surprised you didn't run into him outside, he just left. Let me heat that up for you. No, no, no. I'm used to eating cold food. What's the matter with you? I don't know, I'm just a little under the weather I guess. Hey, I'm a doctor. You're a vet. I'll tell you what. A little of Jack's hot sauce would go great on this. There you go! Come on, sit down. You look like you're about to keel over. I just might. Why don't you just stick to the eggs, Cam? You already had one heart attack. Are you through? Yeah. I owe you an apology, Dana. For my actions last night. You know, with your friend Adam. That was a decent thing of him, stopping by to give you a lift and also bring you this great breakfast. Well, you don't have to worry about me. Yeah, well, I do. I made a promise to my brother, so I want you to do whatever you have to do to get yourself through this. You understand? Yeah, I do. Hi. Hi. You bounce back well. Well, I'm starting to feel a little more like myself. My wellness tea. I get it at the herbal store, there's no preservatives. May I? You know what, it's just a little late. I'll just show you how to make it and I'll get out of your hair. This is really good for you. Ok. I'm just going to put some clothes on. Take your time. Dana Morgan's house. Adam, is that you? Nice to hear your voice, too, Ariel. Uh, why are you at my house so late, Adam? Making tea. Ok, is my mom around? Uh, she's upstairs getting dressed. Why, are you guys going out somewhere? No, she was in her robe when I got here. Would you like to hang on for her? Uh, no. Just tell her not to make any plans on Friday because I'm going to come home for her birthday. Ok? Thank you, bye. Hey. Hi. Who was on the phone? Oh, one of those marketing companies. Lesson time. Tea is very, very personal. There are many ways to make tea, but this tea, you need to steep it for eight minutes. Eight. Eight minutes. Got it. And then, a good Georgia girl can add a whole box of sugar if she likes. Oh, I almost forgot. A colleague of mine gave me these tickets for Friday night. Her and her husband couldn't make it. Dixie Chicks? Uh-huh. Oh, these guys are my favourite! Friday though, that's my birthday. I... I can't make it. I know Ariel wants to spend it with me. Wait, didn't you have a birthday last year? Is this an annual thing for you? So you could do it next year? No, actually it's not. Ok, well, I'm sure someone at work can use them. Alright, enjoy. Oh, Adam. I've got your dishes. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Listen, you drink three cups of my wellness tea and you'll feel like a new woman. That'll be nice. How'd you like my cooking? Oh, I couldn't. But Cameron loved it. Well, that's great. Look, I just picked up Max from the vet so I gotta get him home. Say hi to Max. Hi buddy, hi! Nice dog, is he friendly? No, he bites. Cameron Morgan. Hey, Uncle Cam. Why do you sound like Marlon Brando? Stella... Ugh. It's gotta be the flu. What can I do for you, Ariel? Uh, you know that guy Adam, right? Uh huh. Ok, well he's kinda weirding me out. He's been hanging around mom a lot and taking her out to dinner and I just called the house and he was there really late... it's kinda weird. It would be great if you could tell him to back off. Well, it's your mother's business, Ariel. You know, I really think it's not though, because it hasn't been that long since dad and if she hasn't grieved properly, you know, and this guy's hanging around all the time and it's weird. I thought you and this man's son were friends. Uh, it's not his son, it's his stepson. And not really. If you could just tell him to leave her alone, that would be great. Yes. Yes, I will talk to him. Thanks, I love you. Bye. Ariel? Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you, I just wanted to give you these. A nurse at the hospital bought them, she can't go, I thought maybe you could take your mom for her birthday. Wow. I'm supposed to go home and see her tonight actually. Great. Oh, you know what, make it a surprise. What time are you seeing her? 7:30? Ok, the concert starts at 7:00 so just give me one back. Ok. Gershwin Hall's only a five minute walk. You head over there, and I'll be at your mom's at 6:00. Ok, what're you going to tell her? I'll just tell her that something came up at school and you asked me to pick her up because I was going to get Ben anyway so... Ok, yeah. That might work. Yeah, cool. Thank you. Ok, I won't give this to her until we're right at the door so it's... A surprise. A surprise. Ok. You girls have fun. Thanks. Bye, Adam. Don't worry. You've reached Doctor Cameron Morgan. Leave a message and I'll return it. Hey, Uncle Cam, it's Ariel. I just wanted to give you a call and let you know that I talked to Adam and forget what I said before. He's kinda cool, I guess. Ok, that's all, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Ladies and gents, the show is about to begin, please turn off your cell phones. At the tone, please record your message... Hey Adam, it's Ariel. Um, I don't know where you guys are but the show's about to start so please give me a call, let me know what's going on. Ok, bye. Hey. Hey. Uh, my mom is sitting there. Yeah, I know. That's why I'm here. Adam couldn't pick your mom up... What? Some sort of crisis happened at the hospital... He left her at home?! Relax, it's fine, alright? Adam talked to her but she was like 45 minutes away so she was gonna miss most of it, so the box office let me use her seat. This sucks, this was supposed to be her birthday present. Yeah, I know. I know. She's not gonna be alone, alright? Adam said he was on his way over there to have dinner with her. I promise she'll be fine. I'm sorry I scared you the other night. Ladies and gentlemen, the Dixie Chicks! Please leave a message after the tone. Hey baby, it's just me again. Um... I guess you got caught up or something but um... I hope you're ok. Um, call me. Bye. Hello. Hi. I was driving home from the hospital and I remembered it was someone's birthday. Thank you. You're welcome. They're pretty. How are you enjoying the celebration? You guys having a good time? Actually, I've been stood up. Ariel's not here? Did you try calling her? Yeah, multiple times. It just goes right to her voice mail. It's not like her. Well, she is in college, so... and I can see that you've uncorked the wine so it's not a terrible disaster. Yeah, I think I probably had a little too much of that. Did you um... did you want to come in and have a piece of birthday cake? I would love a piece of birthday cake. In fact, I may have an extra bottle of wine in the car to contribute. Not that you need any more! No, but you might need a glass. I might need a glass! I'll be right back. Ok. I found your dog. He was in our neighbour's bushes. Dead. The dog was old. What's your name, kid? Brooks. Brooks, huh? Your parents just let you run around at night, Brooks? They'd have to care. Wouldn't they? They would. You want to do me a favour, Brooks? You want to bury Max for me? I don't want to upset my lady friend. I can do that. Good man. Did you get a hold of your mom? Uh, no. I tried her in the bathroom again, but she didn't pick up. I tried Adam too, but he didn't pick up either. I don't know why they're not answering their phones. I um... I had a nice time tonight. Yeah, it was a good show. Yeah. What'd you do to your hand? Ben! There's a car! Hey! Hey! Hey! What're you doing?! Are you ok? Did you guys get that? Did anyone videotape that? Are you sure you're ok? What happened back there? I'm colour blind. What? I also have tunnel vision. Why didn't you say something? Because I didn't think you'd want to hang out with some disabled guy. My entire field of vision is, like, 20 degrees. Ben, you should have said something. I liked you from the first day I met you. Really? Yeah. I mean, it kinda weirded me out, some of the stuff you did, but uh... it makes sense now I guess. Good thing you never caught me taking your picture. Why were you taking my picture? Um... I photographed you from different angles so I could always find you. Really? Yeah, we go to a really big school. Oh my god. That's actually kinda smart. Wow. I'm so glad you're ok, you really had me worried back there. Yeah, I'm so glad you were there. Me too. Just don't go kicking any more chairs and I think we'll be alright. Good morning, beautiful! I have eggs benny, wellness tea, grapefruit juice for you. Adam, last night... Guilt is a wasted emotion, and it plays havoc with your cardiovascular system. Didn't you have fun last night? I was drunk. I don't even remember. We didn't do anything wrong, Dana. Jack wanted you going on living. Isn't that what you told me? Pretty sure this isn't what he meant. He knew you were human. And, for your own good, don't you think it's time you put his things away? We'll do it together. Ok? I'll help you. Here. Have some tea, and I'll turn on the shower. # Ay ay ay. Hello, good morning? Buenos dias. Como estas? Oh... dios mio. Oh dios mio! Oh dios mio! We lost dad four months ago! And now Uncle Cam? Why couldn't he listen to us? He didn't have to have a massive heart attack! Your Uncle Cam was a grown man, honey. He knew the risks. Maria. Come on, Maria. Are you done with this tray? Yeah, I ate enough earlier. Hey, are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. You seem kinda tired. Did you take a sedative or something? No, of course not. Okay. Oh, my god, mom! Mom, are you okay? Oh, my god, mom! She doesn't need an ambulance. What're you doing here? I was upstairs making the bed. What's wrong with her? Why did she fall like that? She's exhausted! She needs some rest. She's just organized two funerals back to back. Dana? Do you know where you are? Mom, are you ok? She's ok, let's get her up to bed. Come on. Here, let me help you. Come on. There we go. Be careful. There we go. Ok. Woah, hey! I got ya. Hey, I really think I should call her doctor. I think she should go... There's nothing her doctor can do for her that I can't do for her here. Sweetie, I don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to go anywhere. I know, but I think... can I get you something, or...? No, I just want to take a nap. Ok. I'll make her some tea, she'll stay in bed and rest, and you should go back to school. Uh, no, no. I'm not going to go back to school when she's like this. Honey, come here. Adam's a nurse. I know he's a nurse, but... I don't want you missing any more school. I'll call you if anything changes, Ariel. Yeah, please call me. That would be great. It's ok, babe. Ok, well, I'll call you tonight, ok? You call me. It's ok. Alright, you just rest. Focus on yourself. Uh, why was your phone off? It wasn't. Well, it went straight to voice mail. She doesn't need an ambulance. Hey, are you done with this tray here? Hey! You're still here. Uh, yeah, I wanted to do the dishes for her before I left. How's she doing? Oh, she's resting. She's good. Good. Ok. Well, I'm gonna go, so um... tell her I love her and I'll talk to her later. Ok. Ok. Excuse me. You've reached Dana Morgan. I can't come to the phone right now... There's nothing here. That's what I'm telling you. Check again. I have over and over. It's egg and potato, butter, salt... Are you sure? You're sure? There's margarine... Good morning, sunshine. I can't see. Something's wrong with my eyes. Last night I couldn't get up and now I can't see. Here, let me help you. I made you a nice breakfast. Here. What's wrong with me? This is what grief feels like. Here, have some tea. I've rested long enough. I need to get up. No, no, no. Shhhh. No, stay, stay. That's better. Look at that nice breakfast, do you see? Don't you want to eat that? What have you done to me? Where do you keep your suitcases? In the closet? Why can't I walk? Why do I need my suitcase? I got it! This is nice. Did Jack buy this for you? Yes, indeed. Really. Ok, it's beautiful. Answer me! I found the most gorgeous spot. Waterfront... I mean, we were lucky to get it at the last minute. You really need to be resting. You should conserve your energy. Do you like to travel in t-shirts or blouses? Where's my... where's my phone? I just want to talk to Ariel. Let's go with t-shirts. Ok. Who is that for? Don't you worry, just let me take care of you. Adam. Adam, this has gone too far. I just want my phone. Oh, that's a nasty rash. Is it itchy? Stop it! Is it money you want? I don't have any! This house is mortgaged to the hill... I have nothing. Shhh. You're upset. We'll do this later. Ok? All better. Adam! Adam! Ariel! Hey! What's up? Hey, how are you? Were you going to say goodbye? I have to run home and see my mom, but I texted you so... Oh yeah, no, sorry I didn't check them. Alright, well just read it, it'll explain some stuff. Oh, ok. Ok, bye. What's wrong with your eye? What? Your eye is bleeding. What do you mean? Oh my god, your eye is bleeding! What? Yeah! Ok, good news. You are one very lucky young man. If that hemorrhage had been at the back of your retina, your friend here never would have seen it and the damage could have been extensive. But not to worry, you've got a subconjunctival hemorrhage, it'll heal by itself. Now, what are you taking ethambutol for? Etham what? What is that? Um, the antibiotic that you're on. I'm not on any antibiotic. Ben Woods? Your blood work shows that you're loaded with ethambutol. It's what caused the hemorrhage. Um, what is ethambutol used for? Well, generally it's for treating tuberculosis. Uh, didn't you say Adam's mother died of tuberculosis? Yeah, so? Um... can ethambutol cause other kinds of eye problems? Yeah, unfortunately a fair number of them: double vision, visual hallucinations... Like tunnel vision and colour blindness? Deuteranopia, red-green colour blindness and schitomas, blind spots in the field of vision... they're pretty common side effects, especially in patients that have been taking as high of doses as Ben was on. Alright, hang on a second. Am I to understand that you were not taking this medication voluntarily? No. His stepfather was drugging him. What? Yeah, he's drugging my mom, too. Oh my god, oh my god I knew it. Who else would be giving you a tuberculosis drug?! Alright you two, I don't know what's going on here but it sounds to me like the police need to be involved. Yeah, his name is Adam Smith, he's at 329 Birch Avenue. Tell them to hurry! Excuse me, sorry! Trick or treat! Hey! Look, I don't understand why you won't put out an alert when he's obviously taken her somewhere! You saw the note. Your mother said they went away for some R&R. Yeah, but that's not even her handwriting! And she would never go away with him! She just met him! There's no sign of abduction in this house, no sign of force being used. You want me to put out an APB without any evidence of a crime. No, I told you there's evidence he drugged Ben! I told you that. Your boyfriend lives on campus? Yeah. Another student drugged him as... No! That's ridiculous! It's not ridiculous, it's what Smith's lawyer's gonna say if I haul him in with nothing! Here's my card. Cell's on the back. Call me if you get something solid. Thank you. I'll check back in and make sure I talk to both of them. Ok. It's gonna be ok. Good night. Hey. Hey. Look, we're gonna find her. How are we gonna find her? Come sit down. Are you looking for the guy who always hangs around your house? Yeah, have you seen him? He left this morning with your mom, in his convertible. He had a blue suitcase. Do you know where they went? I had to bury his dog for him. His dog died? I thought he was sleeping, but he was stiff. Your name's Brooks, right? Yeah. Can you show me where you buried the dog? He's under that mound over there. Hey. I'm sorry. They found traces of ethembutol in the dog's bloodstream. Hey, come on. I want to show you something. Come on. Ethembutol has a lot more side effects than just eye problems. excessive tiredness, nausea, disorientation, visual and audio hallucinations, trouble breathing and death. Hey, uh... where was your mother buried? Um, her death was attributed to an overdose, painkillers. Adam had her cremated. Um... uh, what about his first wife? Do you know her name? What was her name? Miss Texas? No, um... Libby. Libby something. Libby Miss Texas. Here. 1997 Miss Texas, Elizabeth Schuster. She could be a Libby, right? Yeah, try that. Ok, Elizabeth Schuster... Woah, what are we looking for? Just anything that leads them to Adam. I can't read that fast! It's ok, it's alright, I'm reading it, it's fine. Elizabeth Bennet, Dallas Texas. What is Deadly Union? What is that? Oh my god, that's Adam! Oh my god. Uh, Patrick Adamson was acquitted of attempted murder yesterday. The trial took so long primarily due to past evidence of complaints from Bennet, the controversial Munchausen by Proxy case, I don't know what that is, has rocked Texas since last summer when the former Miss Texas accused her new husband of poisoning her breakfast tea. Perpetrator was a fabricator that caused illnesses in other... Potentially lethal? ...seen a way of obtaining love. Symptoms, what symptoms? Every time I came home, Adam was always making tea for my mom. Oh my god, Adam's insane. What's going on? He's poisoning them. I'm going to call the detective, ok? Um... Hi, Detective Harcroft? It's Ariel Morgan. Uh, you're gonna want to put out that APB. Can you please just take me to the hospital? My hands and my feet are on fire. Here. Drink your wellness tea. Look where you are. Isn't that beautiful? Fresh air's gonna do you good. It's in there, isn't it? What you've been giving me. That's why you wanted me to drink it three times a day. Go on. I don't want it. Go on. No! How come you got blood in your mouth? George! George! Didn't I tell you to stay outta your momma's room? She's sick! There, there, darling. There's nothing to be frightened of. I love you, momma. None of you cared about me like I cared about you. I'm a good boy, momma. I'm a good boy. Where does he get the ethembutol? He must have a supply, right? Maybe the hospital. No, he'd never be able to pick that much up at a time, right? What if he's prescribed ethembutol? We gotta call the pharmacies. Help! Somebody! Hi, yes, I'm calling to see if a prescription was purchased for... ...ethembutol? Yeah, I'll hold. That's right, Smith Adam. It's for ethembutol? Ok, yeah fine, I'll try there. Thanks, bye. Alright, how many more? Uh... 13 I don't make a habit of filling out of town doctor's scripts, but you being a nurse and all... your wife's on an unusually high dose. The side effects could be very... I'm well versed. Hi, yes. I'm calling to see if a prescription was picked up this morning for Adam Smith for ethembutol? A Joe Smith? Uh huh? Yeah, no he probably just wrote down the name wrong. Um, and where did you say you were located? Great, ok, thank you so much! A prescription was picked up this morning for ethembutol for a Joe Smith in uh... Robert's Creek. Come on, let's go! Help! Somebody help me! Yeah, that's what they said. Just keep calling any hotels or vacation homes, anywhere they might be staying. Help! Somebody help me! Dana! Where are you? Oh no, god! Dana! Oh my god. Dana, come back! Dana, don't do this! Come on back, I ain't gonna hurt you! Dana, please. Dana, you're sick! You need my help! Let me help you! I don't trust you! Please, Dana! Don't do this! Come on! Come on! Ariel told me to come get you! She told me to take care of you, Dana! I don't believe you! No! Dana! Do you have a Dana Morgan or Joe Smith registered there? You do? Joe Smith rented one of your cottages? What's the number? What's the number? Um, what's the number there? Oh, you don't have one? Ok, what is the exact location of that cottage? Dana! Dana! Get away from me! No! Let me help you! There it is, there it is! That's it! That's it! No! Let me help you! Ahhhhhhhh! I'm trying to help you! Ahhhhhhhh! Mom!? She's not here! What? She's not here. MOM! MOM! Dammit. Why is the car still there? I know, I know, they're not here! Did you hear that? What? That, right there! The yelling! Did you hear it? No, I didn't hear anything. I think it's coming from over there. Wait for the cops, just stay here! MOM! I'm gonna take care of you. MOM! I'm going to take care of you, Dana. What's going on? Where are they? I don't know, I think they went that way. Down here. Spread out. Ariel! Ariel! Let her go. Your mother's coming with me. She needs me. She's sick! She's not going anywhere with you. Mom! She's sick! She's coming with me! Get off me! Get off me! Couldn't leave it alone, could you? Can't you see she needs me?! I know who you are, Patrick Adamson. Rot in hell! Get off! GET OFF ME! She needs me! She needs me! She needs me! She needs me! Got him! Got him, right here! Stay down, Adamson. Ridgewood police. You're under arrest. I thought that I lost you! I couldn't find you! I love you! You found me! Let's go, on your feet. On your feet! Let's go. I trusted you. I know. It's nice for them here, right? Yeah. Yeah, it is. You know, Uncle Cam might still be here if he wasn't on his heart pills when he drank Adam's coffee. Well, we're never going to know that for sure. Come on. So is Ben meeting you at the house? Yeah, we're gonna go for a walk. He doesn't really have anybody anymore. His mom's gone and Adam's... at least his eyesight is coming back. That's good. He has you. And so do I.
