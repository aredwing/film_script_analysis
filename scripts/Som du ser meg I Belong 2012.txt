I'm Steinar. - Eva Cecilie. Hello. Come in, come in. You had no problems finding the way? It went just fine. - You didn't have any trouble parking? - No, I took the bus. Well, here we are. Feel free to use the sofa. You want something to drink? Tea? Yes please. What sort would you like? Black tea, green tea, Women's Energy Organic? - Chamomile tea? - I'll have chamomile. - You want honey with that? - Yes please. Thanks. Interesting language. Your first book? - Short stories? - A novel. Well, I leafed through it last night. It's subtle. - Has it sold well? - Yeah, I think so. Hey, my throat is a bit sore. I hope it's not a problem? It depends on whether you sound different. Well, it's hard for me to tell, but... I guess we'll just have to try and see how it goes. Is this the first time you make an audio book? Many choose to use an actor. Well, we'll have to try and see. Just come with me. Okay. Go ahead. - "When you least expect it". - What? That's the title. "When you least expect it". - Shall I start over? - Yes. "When you least expect it". "This story began with the King's annual New Year speech." As usual, it was full of goodness and hope for humanity. In a time that often emphasises the superficial, - - it is easy to lose sight of the value of the individual person. It is the value that each of us have simply through being human. This shooting star of creation, - - this union of the laws of nature and mysteries of the soul. There is only one of each of us, and we are all irreplaceable. Most of us know that such speeches are merely specks of gold - - that lend a touch of humanity to festive occasions. "And when the moment passes, the realisation will return" - - "that reality is more complex." Something about the King's words echoed in many people - - that winter and spring, including three women in Granliveien. They woke up one day hoping it was all a misunderstanding. That it would work out anyway. But life's bothersome trivialities were waiting at their doorstep. - What's happened? - Look at this! They've punctured every single tyre here. - Did they get your car? - No. You've been lucky. Typical. Now I'll be late for work. I can give you a lift if you want. Where are you going? - Aker Hospital. - No problem. You want a lift as well? - Could I really? - Thank you so much. It's so low. I know people may need to vent their frustration, but... Slashing tires seems pointless. But maybe that's the whole idea. To do something that feels as pointless as life itself. It wasn't Lise Gundersen's day. "She was heading for work, and with it a workplace conflict" - - "she'd unexpectedly been drawn into." Hi, Lise. It had begun three weeks earlier, when Lise reluctantly agreed - - to mentor a student. Hey, we'll get new interns next week. Would you like to mentor one of them? Me? Well... I haven't mentored an intern before. - Then it's about time you did. - I see. Right. - I'm not sure I'm suitable. - You'll get instruction in advance. All the others have mentored. I think it's your turn. - I didn't know we took turns. - Not in theory. But in practice. Don't you agree everyone should take their turn? Do their part? - Isn't that most fair? - Absolutely. That's not what I mean. I'd love to do it, but don't know if I should. Why not? You just have to gauge her performance. You're very skilful. - I guess I have no choice. - I can't force you. - That's not what I meant. - Relax. Okay? Very good. Lise didn't have any problem doing her share. On the contrary. She always helped out. But this was different. She liked her job as it was, and didn't need more. She knew she should be open to new challenges. It could be a development opportunity for her. "But to what?" Lise thought. I've been asked to be mentor, or contact nurse, for a student. Mentor? How does that work? I'll follow her up during the internship, evaluate her performance. - Do you have the competence for that? - I'm a nurse. - I'll get a course. - How exciting. - A challenge. - I don't know. - Will you get extra pay? - I don't know, but I hardly think so. - But you should. - I agree. You should ask for something. It's extra work. You deserve compensation. I don't think that's how it works. We take turns. Besides, I get a free course. They should pay you to attend. It's not as if skill development is a fringe benefit. It seems to be a sort of mentality in the health sector, that - - you should be working for free. It's typical of women to insist that honest work and decent pay don't mix. It's not. Hello? Suddenly it's all about getting me a raise. But that's not... Well, the problem. Not what it's about. - What's the matter? - I don't know. I'm not sure I like challenges. I don't have any management skills. I'd be afraid to say something wrong. Lise's husband was a real catch. She could discuss anything with him. He seemed to have a gift for making her see the bright side. My little darling. You worry too much. Don't do it if you don't want to. But if you do, you'll do a great job. - You think so? - I know it. She often thought about it, when watching a sad movie, - - or tending a severely hurt patient, how lucky she was to have him. Hey? Can I read something for you? Sure. She hung her dreams in the wind Here we flutter Come world, be a letter Not life But claw marks of a life - You're not that fond of poetry. - No? You're not really that interested. Aren't you happy with me? I'm happy with everything but that. You can't have everything. - Are you happy with me? - Isn't it evident? - Lise, has he had his medication? - Yes, certainly. - This is Siri Helene Kvernland. - Just call me Siri. Lise Gundersen will be your mentor. Right, take the expectation interview first. I've shown her around the ward. Okay. Welcome. Any problems getting here? - No, I went by bus. - Right. Exactly. Let's sit down and start by reviewing the procedures. We can start here. Our procedures are all described in this booklet. It's easy to relate to. When in doubt, you can simply consult it. Everything you need to know is written here. This is okay. Look. Great. I've seen a few procedure booklets before. I mean, they're on the Internet. But this is good. - I'll start by leafing through it. - Yes, have a look. And it went well. After all, this was Lise's specialty. She found it easy to convey. And Siri was a bright student. - Hi there. How's it going? - Good. - Don't you think? - Yes, absolutely. - It's going very well. - I'm glad to hear. See you. Could you give us a hand, Lise? Could you start? Is it okay by you? Yes, I'm sure it'll be fine. Let's see... Just tell me if... It hurts a bit, I know. - Everything okay? - Yes. Oh, that's better. Thank you. Right. Now everything should be in order. Anything wrong? No, it's fine, and I should have mentioned it before. You must remember to always use gloves when treating wounds. Bacteria are everywhere. It's easy to forget. You might as well make a habit of always putting them on at once. You're talking about in there? I washed my hands before I started. - Isn't that enough? - I'm afraid not. Because... I was going to put them on. But I dropped one on the floor, and decided it was better not to use it. Right, but what you should've done, was throw it away and get a new pair. But hey, I know what you thought. You'd washed your hands... Lise was startled when she saw what Siri had done. She realised she hadn't been prepared to discipline her. "All in all, Lise thought she'd handled it well." "Until the next incident a few days later." - Can I have my painkillers now? - Of course. They're on your nightstand. Siri, could you just... Right. There you go. Hey? Come outside and close the door. Okay, what you did right now, the way you handled the pills... - Was there a problem with that? - Yes. Was that completely hygienic? - I used gloves. - Yes, but... - Gloves used on another patient. - But I was only watching. Yes, but you must wash your hands when moving to another patient. Read about it in the procedures. It's incredibly important. Okay. So I should've taken my gloves off and washed my hands? It sounds laborious, but that's how it is. Is it a problem? - No, if it's in the procedures... - It is. Why doesn't she see the importance of hygiene? If she doesn't improve, I'll have to flunk her. - Is it that bad? - Yeah. Maybe you should have a word with her. Tell her where she stands. Yes, I know. That's what's so difficult. You can do it, you know. You're a good communicator. Hi. I thought I'd ask you how she's doing. What's her name again? Siri. Mostly quite well. She shows sound judgement, and... - But she's careless about hygiene. - That can be quite serious. And it's elementary stuff. Forgetting gloves when changing bandages etc. - That won't do. Have you told her? - Yeah, I have. - I'm not sure she takes it seriously. - She has to. Breach of hygiene procedures is enough to fail. And she shouldn't be washing her hands for fear of flunking. - She must understand. - What shall I say? I can't dictate your precise wording, dear. But if you think it's that serious, she needs a warning in writing - - at least three weeks before the end of her term. - Isn't that very dramatic? - Failing is dramatic. You've cautioned her verbally. Write a warning and give it to Siri. It will be reviewed at a meeting with me, you, Siri and her tutor. - When's the mid-term evaluation? - Next week. We'll do it then. You summon the meeting. So I'll just leave it until the meeting? No, you have to handle the issues as they arise. That's your job. Okay. Right. Hi, have you had lunch? Say in five minutes? Then we can set a date for the mid-term evaluation. - Yeah, okay. - Great. Okay, Friday the 6th. Will you tell my tutor? Yes, okay. I hope I get another chance at setting a venous catheter. - It's a challenge. - It sure is. I think you did well. With some practice, you'll be excellent. - You think so? - I think you do very well in general. You have a basic understanding, which is really important. It's just the hygiene bit, but you'll get a letter about that. It's no big deal. But cautioning a student has to be done in writing. You'll get it on Monday. Don't worry. A written caution? What do you mean? We've talked a lot about hygiene. The importance of using gloves when changing bandages. - Washing your hands between patients. - Right. But I think I'm attentive to that. Am I so sloppy that I need a written caution? Maybe. No offence, but I've mentioned it before. - It could be enough to fail, so... - Fail? What? Are you saying I'll flunk because I don't wash my hands well? - Well, let's not jump to conclusions. - What do you mean? I'm just trying to say... Oh dear. I have to make sure you realise the importance of hygiene. - I know hygiene is important. Really. - Good. I'm not trying to scare you. I just have to know you take it seriously. Now I know that you do. So you don't have to think about it any more. - Because I take it seriously. Really. - That's great. It'll be just fine. By the way... - Are you from England or something? - No. - And you don't have relatives there? - No. - Why do you ask? Do you? - No, no. It's nothing. It's just unusual when people suddenly switch to English. You think so? A lot of people do it. He's been recumbent so long that his musculature has weakened. His blood pressure plummeted when he got up. Have a look at him. I think he needs a little... Sorry, I have to handle this. Siri? Excuse me? Did you clean your hands before leaving the washroom? - Yes, I did. - Okay. Did you have the time? To me it looked like you just popped in there. I don't get it. Are you calling me a liar? You weren't there. No, but how did you do it in such a short time? Speak Norwegian, please. I can't take it anymore. You accuse me of lying. It's pretty gross. And speak Norwegian, goddammit! Lise struggled to express herself in writing. She thought everything she wrote sounded strict. She didn't want Siri to fail, but her conscience bound her to the truth. My god! I can't believe it. - What's happened? - Look at this! - They've punctured every single tyre. - What? - Hello? - Hi, Lise. I've written the caution. Could you look at it? Could we have the evaluation meeting on Friday? - The meeting is now. - Right now? Haven't you heard? I should have told you. Sorry. Siri filed a complaint against you. Anne Mona represents the college. - Lise Gundersen. - Anne Mona Lerkebakke. - Complaint? About what? - Poor and misleading instruction. She says you communicate poorly. Is that right? - No... Uh... What do you mean? - Well, well. This is unpleasant, but the report may clarify your view. Can I see it? Right, we talked about that. Okay... Well, if this is correct, she's not qualified to pass. There's Siri. Well, the meeting can start. I'll copy the report first. Maybe you can fetch a Thermos of coffee and some cups? - Coffee? - Just half a cup. No thanks, I get heartburn. - Right, have you read Lise's report? - Yes. Well, I must say that I think there's good reason for this caution. I think I need a new mentor. I didn't get proper instruction. It sounds wild, but Lise's been after me from day one. She deliberately tries to confuse me by speaking English. I didn't want to say anything, but when she accused me of lying, - - I could no longer remain silent. You're saying the report is incorrect? I rinsed the pans in the washroom, cleaned my hands and left. Lise says you couldn't have had the time. - Yes, but she's mistaken. - So how long were you in there? - Maybe ten seconds. I'm quick. - How long was she in there? Ten seconds sounds right. She may have rinsed her hands. But washing them properly takes more time. - I agree with Lise. - I'm afraid she's right. I should point out that she's been cautioned about hygiene before. - So it's nothing new. - No. I know I wasn't attentive enough to hygiene at first. But I pulled myself together ahead of the evaluation. That doesn't sound good at all. The evaluation can't be the reason. It must be because you want to do your job thoroughly and safely. That came out wrong, but... The point is that I've improved. And she fails to mention - - that I washed my hands again when I returned to the patient's room. She had a difficult wound, so I was extra careful about hygiene. It's not mentioned here. Didn't you notice, Lise? - No. - Because you weren't there. You were in the corridor. You may have noticed that I was drying my hands when you returned. But that's not the point. You must scrub before leaving the washroom. - See? She keeps speaking English. - I agree we have to follow procedure. But she washed her hands before seeing the next patient. - Why wasn't it in the report? - I don't know. Sorry, but... Let's speak Norwegian now. You were saying? I don't know. Sorry. Okay. I didn't notice that, but... - Well, I don't believe her. - See what I mean? - Why are you speaking English? - It's been like that all along. She switches to English whenever she corrects me. It's hard to relate to. At first I thought she was joking. - Is it true? - Well, I mean... Maybe I use some English occasionally. Don't we all? - No. I don't. It's not usual. - It's no good. If it's true, which it evidently is, it can't be easy for the student. Since Siri's done so well earlier, I would suggest - - that she continue her internship with another mentor. Do you really think so? Well, maybe it's the only solution. It's a strange situation. There's evidently communication problems. It's possible she's mistaken. But in any case, Siri, - - you have to take hygiene seriously in this business. You realise we can't have nurses that pose a risk to patients. Do you hear me? Look at me! Do you even understand what I'm saying? Do you? Good. Gro Sreide speaking? Yes, but I checked her today. Just a moment. Lise? We have to talk more about this. Come by when you have time. - Hi. - Hi. Are you okay? We should've talked. It's been hectic. I came by after lunch. You were in a meeting. I've been busy all day. We still have to talk. - Did you find it hard? - Being a mentor, you mean? - No, not really. - Surely there were some problems? Maybe you should talk to someone? Like an occupational psychologist. I'll arrange it. The personnel department has just hired a human resources consultant. Oh? Well, I don't know... In my view, this boils down to a communication problem. But you can get help, you know. So you think I communicate poorly? You can always get better. I think you should see the consultant. Think about it. We'll talk again over the weekend. - Well, well. Another day is done. - That's a nice top. Thanks. Almost new. Bought it in Paris. Silk. - Paris? Did you go with your husband? - No, with friends. I'm not married. - Okay. I thought you were married? - No, although I'm seeing someone. Been there, done that. Marriage and children are overrated. Not my cup of tea. But you mustn't worry about this. It'll be fine. Okay? - Think about what I said. Bye. - Goodbye. - Hi. - Hi. We've got visitors? Lise. - Mads. - Hi. How nice. Right. - Are you making dinner? - Pasta and tuna salad. - Is it enough? We've got chicken. - It's okay. How was your day? - Pretty tiring. - What happened? Well, there were some problems with the student I was mentoring. I'm a nurse. I've been mentoring a student. She was about to fail. - Was there trouble? - Yes, but must we talk about it? - Why not? Tell us what happened. - Well... She claimed she didn't understand what I meant when I corrected her. That it was my fault because I chose the wrong wording. I don't know. She claimed I spoke English and so on. But you do. Mom switches to English when she's uncertain. - No, come on... - But you do. - Right, dad? - Maybe she does. Are you born in England? Some revert to their mother tongue under stress. - If your parents are British... - They're not. - No wonder the student reacted. - It's not that uncommon either. I saw many complaints against mentors when I was a student representative. I don't feel like talking about it. And I shouldn't. I have confidentiality. Don't let it get to you. You'll get another chance. It'll be different. I don't want another chance. I don't want to do it again. It's been a horrible experience. Right now I just want to quit. I don't see how I can ever return. You can't just quit, you know. Your job means the world to you. Shall I read you a poem? I don't think I feel like it. Talking in bed ought to be easiest Lying together there goes back so far An emblem of two people being honest Yet more and more time passes silently Outside, the wind's incomplete unrest builds and disperses clouds about the sky And dark towns heap up on the horizon None of this cares for us Nothing shows why At this unique distance from isolation it becomes still more difficult to find words at once true and kind Or not untrue And not unkind - I could never get by without you. - Sure. - I think you could. - Could you get by without me? I can't imagine life without you. Sometimes I wonder what I'd do if you died or left me. - I won't leave you. We're married. - But you might grow tired of me. How could I ever grow tired of you? I don't know. It could happen. Maybe you'd want to be with someone else? Who might that be? - Why do you ask? Do you? - Me? No. You may be attracted to others even though you're married. It would have to be David Beckham. - David Beckham? Why, are you joking? - No. He's got a great body. Does that make you upset? No. Lise wondered whether she'd been mistaken. It's hard to feel completely safe and free at the same time. And Lise, who'd thought they necessitated each other, realised - - she'd got it all wrong. Translator Grete Maigret had similar thoughts. She was to meet her editor to turn down a book she couldn't vouch for. Though it meant disloyalty to her publisher, - - risking her job and a friend. - Where are you going? - If you could... When you reach... Could you drop me off by Tullinlkka? - I can drive you all the way. - How kind of you. Sorry, can we take a break? I need to use the restroom. Yeah, okay. It's in the corridor. It's down the hallway, the first door to the left. By the entrance. Grete Maigret had never had to choose between loyalty and integrity before. Most people wouldn't care. But for Grete Maigret it became a problem of existential dimensions. She cherished her integrity. For her, jeopardising it - - was a question of having something to live for or not. When Grete Maigret was 16... Sorry, you sure you're not pronouncing it wrong? - No, it's a French name. Maigret. - Is she French? No, she took the name. When Grete Maigret was 16, she was a small-town girl called Ellen Jensen. Maybe you should adjust your voice here, since Grete is sleeping. One summer evening, she went with her boyfriend to listen to records. But instead she was strapped to a bed and raped by him and his buddy. She never told anyone. "Instead she completed high school in another town." "After her parents passed away, she took the name of her grandaunt," - - "who'd married a Belgian, hence the surname Maigret." Grete Maigret had no siblings, and apart from a couple of colleagues, - - she had no friends. When she heard about rape on the radio, she felt a certain solidarity. Even community. But she knew it was only a semblance of community. And that you don't want to identify with others in the same situation. She'd struggled to get over her past. When she now looked in the mirror, - - she saw a translator, not a victim. But though you take every precaution, protection is never complete. Something will inevitably penetrate even the most advanced defences. For Grete, the assault happened - - the day she went to meet her new editor for the first time. Her former editor had died unexpectedly. Grete Maigret, who was translating a new book, got a new editor. She'd just joined the publishing house. And Grete Maigret had never met her before. Yes? Hi! Come in. Grete Maigret. Oh my god! I've really looked forward to meeting you. I've always been a huge fan. Ever since I read "Life's a Party". Great translation. And "The Solipsism Syndrome". Jeez. The astounding vocabulary you created there. And I must say you have exceptionally good taste as well. You suggested them for translation, right? That's wonderful. Really, really wonderful. Would you like something to drink? Tea? Coffee? No? I don't quite know where to start. I've read the manuscript. I don't know how you usually work. It feels odd, - - taking over a project halfway, but... You must have known Ragnar well. You worked with him for years. Pity. Here it is. It's still his office. I've tried to tidy up a bit. - Make it mine. So I can find stuff. - Obviously. But hey, what do you think about the manuscript? Is it finished? Almost. Not much left. Have you read the English translation? Yes, or... No. I'm reading it, but I haven't got through it yet. Well, it's not bad. But I feel they misinterpret a main character, Stefan. He's portrayed as a victim. But in the original, he uses his tragedy more offensively. - Do you know what I mean? - No. Instead of resigning, he accepts it, and eagerly awaits the next disaster. He feels cast in a novel that gets more thrilling as things fall apart. That's what makes the book exciting. - Doesn't that sound improbable? - Not really. - Well, maybe not improbable... - It's survival. Accepting pain as part of life. Embracing it instead of avoiding it. Jesus. I'm getting images of childbirth. Do you have children? No? I have one. But you're right. Life would probably be easier if you thought that way. I don't know if making it easier is the point. Hell will be hell in any case. I should've been better prepared. I'll reread both your version and the English translation. But could we meet again soon? Maybe over the weekend? Okay? And thanks for now. It's been a great pleasure to meet you. Really. Simply talking to you feels like an enrichment. - Well, goodbye. - Bye. Hi, Grete. I brought my child to work. He has a father. But he's busy today, so mom has to step in. Just go inside. - Nice blouse. - You think so? Thank you. I got it in NYC. Mixed organic fibre. Wonderful. Feel how soft it is. Yes, lovely. - You've moved the desk? - Yes. I've been trying to make it mine. I'd have preferred a smaller one. - It comes with a responsibility. - That's exactly how it feels. Yes, are you hungry? Are you hungry? There. Yes. Are you so hungry? Well, Grete. I've finished reading the book. I think you were right about the English translation. What a depressing book! It's great. - But there's no hope for anyone. - Hope? - Hope? - Yes, hope. Maybe not. But that's irrelevant. That's not what it's about. - No? What do you think it's about? - Well, you tell me. I think it explores the concept of humanity, what it might be. Evil is often described as inhuman. This means we associate human - - with good. But when you see what humans do to each other, - - you soon realise we're not particularly good, on the contrary. Is that what you think? Isn't that very brutal? We mustn't be afraid to be serious. No, we won't be afraid to be serious, will we? Oops. Sorry, I think I have to change his diapers. Hey? Hey! In one end, out the other. Hey, let's see. Wow... Sorry about that. Really. But... - This is as good as done. - Yes. We should start discussing the next title. I have a few on my list. But what are you reading now? - I keep a stack on the nightstand. - Right. Tell me if there's something you love. I really want your input. Just so you know. Think about it. We'll talk later. Bye. Bye, Grete. Goodbye, Gretchen. Grete Maigret felt the strain. It wasn't unusual for her to suggest books for translation. But suddenly it felt imperative to find the right book - - as soon as possible. Hi. - Could you give this to Anne? - Sure. Are you here, Grete? Do we have an appointment? - No, I just stopped by with a book. - Which one? Julia Schtz? That's great. I've just read it. I was thinking about you when I read it. What a coincidence! Are you in a hurry? I've got a lunch appointment. Can we walk and talk? Great! They're making a park here. I'd have preferred a building. Like a futuristic swimming hall. I think Oslo lacks daring buildings. But don't you like trees, open spaces? It's usually the case - - when on rare occasions a new park is opened, people throng to it. - Doesn't that prove they need it? - Yes, but people need art as well. Imagine, we fell for the same book! "Einfache Atonale Stcke fr Kinder". - What a great title! - I didn't know you read German. - I prefer the original language. - I should've known. How could you have? I really like Julia Schtz. She was more or less presented as a sensation - - at the Frankfurt Book Fair four or five years ago. Her first novel had just come out. Have you read it? A big hit in Germany. A wonder nobody's picked her up here. Well, I knew about her, but her books didn't interest me much. They remind me of women's pulp. Sorry. But this one's different. It's on another literary level. Short, dry, but excellent. It felt like eating crispbread with cured ham. The foundation crumbles as you eat, and you're left with the spread. - Do you understand what I mean? - No, that doesn't sound good. - Why do you want to translate it? - Precisely because nothing happens. Everything important evaporates as you read. While the superficial remains, like an exclamation mark. It's brilliant social analysis. And it's not boring, not for a second. - Demanding to read, but not boring. - Great. "Demanding to read, but not boring." You're right. I found it really moving. It's probably a key feminist work as well, right? I'd say so. A wonder nobody's translated it yet. - Well, would you like me to start? - Read some of her other books first. I agree this is the best. But if we're to build a readership for this author, I think we must - - start with some of her earlier, lighter works. I'll have them sent to you. Hi! I suggest that we start with her first novel. It's really a pearl. It's so immediate, you know. But hey, we'll talk later. Bye! Hi! Could you sign here? Oh, Grete. Grete Maigret read on, increasing dejected. "Trash, " she thought. Should you translate trash? "Hi, Anne. Thanks for the books you sent me. I've read them all." "It's true that Julia's first books have qualities." "Hi, Anne. Thanks for the books." "I've read them all. Though they contain good passages," - - "I'm afraid I can't recommend any of them for translation." "I think the author reveals ignorance about fundamental human traits." "This creates credibility problems, specially in the first novel." "Personally I find her books as noisy and superficial as tabloid papers." "Indifferent sentences piled on top of each other for maximum effect." "The invasion of empty talk makes you want to put away her books for good." Courage... Why was it so hard? She tried to convince herself to stand by her opinions. But she immediately imagined Anne's disappointment. Yes, it's Grete Maigret. Yes. Right. Hi, Anne. I wondered if we could meet? Do you need a lift as well? - Could I? - Of course. She decided to tell her in person. But when she arrived at the publishing house, Anne wasn't there. - Hi, Anne. - Hi, Grete! - How nice. - I brought you this. Thanks. Oh, that one. I've been planning to read it. Thank you. The receptionist told me you were ill. And appendicitis! How painful! Did it happen all of a sudden? Yes, completely. I was in my office, working. Suddenly I felt this pain in my belly. I thought it was something I'd eaten, and went home. But during the night it became completely unbearable. I was rushed to ER for operation. I was afraid I'd die. I've actually had appendicitis as well. Well, I remember that it was terribly painful. But it's a long time ago. I was 14. I was at my aunt's cabin outside... I think it's odd they have to make such a huge incision. I thought they used keyhole surgery. Seems it depends on the hospital. So my scar is huge. What about your scar? Is it huge? - No, I don't know. I don't think so. - No? No, I don't know what's long or short. - May I have a look? - Well... Okay, have a look. Wow. Almost invisible. Just a couple of centimetres. My god. I can't believe it. I'm sorry. I just don't like the thought of a huge scar on my belly. Guess it's just vanity. Oh. But... How's the reading going? Have you found anything worthwhile? Well, I'm not sure. I've read the books you sent me. They're unlike the one I suggested. Yes, but I don't think they're worse. On the contrary. - No, maybe not. - What about her first novel? I'd love to have it translated. No, I don't think I'm the right person for the job. It's so... To be perfectly honest, I find it a little... A little young. But isn't that interesting, reading about someone younger than yourself? - Yes, of course. That's not it. - Can't you please say yes? I can't imagine any translator more suited for the job than you are. - That sounds like flattery. - No, that's not my intention. I'll have it translated in any case. I just really want you to do it. But you mustn't do it for my sake. Don't compromise your integrity. It's not the world's best book. But I still want to publish it. - Well, I don't know. - Hey, you know what? Just translate this one first, then do the one you suggested. We'll release both within a year. We'll invite Julia Schtz - - to the launch of the first one. It'll be good, right? Gretchen? Well, I... - Maybe I should do it. - That's great. Great. Grete Maigret told herself not to be dramatic. So what if she translated a book she disliked? "People do it all the time, " she thought. But the idea of doing such an unpleasant job was painful. She told herself she'd do it for Anne's sake. Only for Anne. Strangely, the thought - - filled her with an urgency that seemed almost like joy. Grete did the job in three days. She'd never been more efficient. She emailed the translation to Anne, who called her immediately. Grete Maigret speaking? Hi, Anne. This is fantastic. Really good. A few weeks later, Anne invited Grete Maigret to see the result. Hi! Look at this. Fresh from the print shop. Well, it looks nice. It turned out great. Congratulations. Thank you. You really think so? I think you've improved it. I'm very satisfied. We're working to get Julia Schtz to Norway. It'll be great. By the way, my 40th birthday is coming up. Well, it's still two weeks away. I thought I'd have a dinner party. Not a huge gathering, just my closest friends. Tapas and wine. Would you like to come? - Certainly. That sounds very nice. - Great. Hi! Welcome. Come in. - May I take your coat? - Yes, thank you. Hi, Grete. Welcome. Look, I got a dog. I'm allergic to dogs. - Come again? - I'm allergic to dogs. Sorry. Are you allergic? Oh dear. We'll put him in the bedroom. - But there's dog hairs everywhere. - Shall I take him? I'll do it. Will you show Grete in? - Let's see... Want this? - Thank you. - Need anything from here? - There's some wine. Would you like a glass of wine, Grete? Maybe a beer? Yes, white wine would be fine. Thank you. - Grete, this is Lars and Marianne. - So you're Grete Maigret? How nice. - Hi. Marianne. - I heard a rumour you'd be here. I must admit that you've translated many of my favourite books. Really. One can't help noticing your name. - Are you French? - No, it's a family name. There may be some Belgian ancestry, but I'm not Belgian. - You're not related to the inspector? - What? No. - You must be tired of that question. - No, nobody's asked me before. - You're kidding! - Seems I was original. But it's odd. Most people would associate the name with crime novels. - Crime isn't exactly your genre. - Not really. Grete mainly translates German books. Narrow literature, wouldn't you say? So I was surprised to hear you'd translated Julia Schtz. - Julia Schtz? - Chic lit writer. She's been in the media recently. For instance, she claims porn - - is a form of feminism. Okay, she's written a couple of good books. - But you translated her first novel? - Yes. - What are you talking about? - Julia Schtz' book. - Have you read it? - No, but Grete translated it. Oh, so you're Grete Maigret? What an honour to meet you! Anne managed to coax you out? I've read nearly all your translations. - I must say they're excellent. - Thanks. Anne says you can choose what you want to translate. That's impressive. But I don't understand why you chose to translate Julia Schtz. - No offence, but why? - Well... I don't know what to say. Don't get me wrong. The translation is excellent. But the book is trite and unpleasant. As if women dream of being raped. - That's a bit farfetched. - Are you writing a review? Yes. Maybe I'm out of line, but Anne said you were eager to translate it. What do you think? Does it have hidden qualities? Excuse me, I have to find the toilet. I'll be back. Grete Maigret? You don't know me. Ingunn Tvedt, marketing director. - Oh yes, of course. - Don't look so frightened. It's strange we haven't met earlier. Congratulations on the Schtz translation. It's now the main title in the Book of the Month Club. I must say I'm glad Anne persuaded you to take it. - So you like it? - Well, it's 150 pages of apt wording. Not exactly my favourite literature, but... All of Germany has embraced it. So what can I say? Can 80 million be wrong? The population of Germany. Not all have read it, and 80 million can be wrong, specially in Germany. - Excuse me, where's the toilet? - In the hallway, to the right. Relax, Grete. Jesus. It's just a tiny dog. Hey? Relax. Let's go somewhere else. In here. Here, you know. You can stay here. - Hey? What happened? - Nothing. If you're that allergic, - - you should ask if your hosts have pets before you arrive. You mean call to ask if they have a dog? Yes. - If you're that allergic. - Very well. Hey, why haven't you told me that the critics already have Schtz' book? Well, they do. I distributed it ahead of Schtz' visit. Oh, I'm sorry I didn't call you. I should have. But she was here just a few hours. Lots of interviews and so on. Not that you missed much. She's extremely self-centred. But a very persuasive speaker, so the reporters loved her. I think it'll be okay, no matter what the critics think. Have you heard that it's the Book of the Month? I hope to get Schtz back here. NRK wants to interview her for an art fashion programme. Otherwise we'll just have to shake it off. Wait for the movie. - Is this where you're hiding? - Hi! Even? Hi. How good to see you! - Happy birthday! - Thank you. You have to say hello to Grete. This is Even. An old friend. Doctor. This is Grete. I told you about her and her scar. I said your scar is smaller than mine. I hate the fact that it's so huge. Maybe I could have something done? It's odd they didn't use keyhole surgery. - May I have a look? - Of course. Here it is. It goes all the way to... Show him yours, Grete. - Does it have to be like that? - Excuse me. Grete! Jesus, relax. What's the matter? - Was it the scar? - No. Excuse me. - It's got nothing to do with that. - Then what is it? I don't know. I think I should leave. I don't feel well. - Shall I call a cab? - No thank you. - Are you sure you don't want a cab? - Yes. - But you'll be okay? - Sure. Hey, it's none of my business. I just wonder whether you have anyone you can talk to? - Talk? - Yes. I don't want to intrude, but it seems as if something's bothering you. - Are you really okay? - Why shouldn't I be okay? Well, I don't know. You just seem... Like, sad. - So melancholy. - Melancholy? I see. Do you think so? Is it because I'm alone? You know, the melancholic used to be seen as visionary. Is that what you mean? In that case, I agree. I don't know. I don't even understand what you mean. - Goodbye, Anne. - Bye, Grete. Grete continued to translate Schtz' books. But while translating the final book, the one she'd recommended, - - the words just wouldn't come. She therefore decided to stop translating books. I just need some water. Let's see... Sorry. "Ann-Kristin was going to pick up her mother. She'd promised..." No. "She'd promised to take her to her sister-in-law." Hi! Have I kept you waiting? Yes. I just sat down. I'll put this in the back seat. Let me... How's your hip? You seem a bit stiff. Well, it's not good. It's better than just after the operation. But it's as if it just keeps getting worse and worse. You must exercise. Do you only get physiotherapy? Yes, physiotherapy is all I get. I've only got one free appointment left. If I have to pay, then... But there's something else. The kitchen ventilator. - It's busted. - Then you'll have to get a new one. I guess it's no use trying to fix it. But I saw an ad for one. With a carbon filter. Special offer. Just under 700 kroner. - Why not get something that lasts? - It'll last. - Aren't they fairly standard? - I don't think so, actually. Well, it'll be good enough for me. Could you lend me 500 kroner? Just until my pension comes through. Might as well buy it, as it's on sale. I don't know. You seem to be borrowing money all the time. There's always something. You still owe me 5000 from last Christmas. Yes, I'm perfectly aware of that. I've got everything under control. You told me there was no rush paying you back. Is it a problem? Has Terje said anything? No, but things are tight right now. Do you need a new one immediately? I can't fry anything without a ventilator. The whole house stinks. Well, why not open the window? You can do that much. Aunt Astrid will be so happy to see you. I told her you were coming. I think Vibeke's home as well. - Vibeke? You didn't tell me. - But isn't that nice? You could've told me. I like to know... Hi! I'm so glad you could come, Ann-Kristin. - You haven't changed. - Well, I've gained some weight. What beautiful flowers! Thank you. And here we have... Gooseberry juice. I can't believe it! - You don't have to take them off. - I've brought slippers, of course. You have? How typical of you! Wow, a new sofa. - Have you made gooseberry juice? - Astrid just loves it. I make her some every year. But where did you get the berries? - I got them at the supermarket. - How did you get there? - Well, have a seat. - Thank you. Hi there! - Hi! - Oh, but look at you! Wow! Hi. - I haven't seen you for ages! - How are you? You're in Berlin? I've lived there for almost ten years. - How nice. Do you enjoy it there? - Yes, I love it. Beautiful city. Have you been there? It's really nice. I'm studying to be a curator, which is great too. I thought Astrid said you studied to be an artist? Yes, I did. These are supplemental studies, within art as well. Some say the curator is the new artist. I don't know about that. I plan to work as both. I've got a curator assignment - - in Barcelona this fall, and an exhibition in Oslo next summer. - Wow, you get around. - So what does a curator do? - Curates. - How exciting! Yes, they do grow up. Are you still working in Norad, Ann-Kristin? - Yes. - What do you do there? I Noradate. No, I work with peace, democratisation and women's rights. Oh my god. It can't get much better. What's your job title? Junior executive officer. Temporary position until Christmas. Is it interesting? Foreign aid, right? It's called development assistance now. I like it. It's a good place to work. Ann-Kristin is really skilful. She's come far. - Can't I brag about my daughter? - You have every reason to. I mean, you've really worked hard, Ann-Kristin. - Haven't you married? - That's ages ago. - Any children? - One, and one more underway. So you're pregnant? How many months? - Twenty-two weeks. - Vibeke? Can't you tell us about the fellow you've moved in with? His name's Jason. - Have you met him? Is he handsome? - Very. We met him the last time we visited Vibeke. Photographer. Kristian liked him. He wanted to buy a picture. Wow, that's great. - What about Kristian? Still as busy? - Yes, that hasn't changed. But he recently inherited some money from Aunt Sigrun. - The one in Bergen? - We went to the funeral. We had a wonderful drive across the mountains. But it came as a surprise. She didn't have any children, so Kristian inherited everything. - Was it a lot? - It was quite sizeable. She owned a block of flats in Bergen, and had plenty of money in the bank. So I think it was several million. Most of it went to inheritance tax. - But there's a fair amount left. - Wow. Congratulations. Or... Can you say that when people inherit? I guess so. You want some chocolate? Thanks. They look lovely. Well, so there's a great deal of money all of a sudden. Kristian and I have talked about it. We'd love to take some of it - - and give it to you. - To me?! We know you're not that well off, so we thought we might help you. We were thinking about one million. Well, technically it'll be a loan. Otherwise the tax would be punitive. It's a gift. But... I don't know what to say. You know I can't possibly accept it. Why not? Good lord. We're family. You were married to my brother. We have to help each other. Erling's finances were a mess. He left you in debt. We think it's unfair that you're to be burdened with it in your old age. Kristian and I have talked about helping you. But we couldn't figure out how. It's hard to accept financial aid. But since we'd inherited the money, we thought it might be easier. You know? Well, I... I'm grateful. I appreciate that fact that you're thinking about me. I don't know what to say. I think this is a bit unpleasant. I'm sorry, but that's my immediate reaction. It's probably wrong of me, but isn't this very weird? But why? We're family. We should help each other. - Don't think of it as a handout. - But that's what it is. I mean... I help mom with her mortgage payments. She's not struggling. Don't misunderstand me, Ann-Kristin. We mean well. What do you think? It's your call. Don't you find it a bit unpleasant? Unpleasant? Why do you say that? Aunt Astrid means well. But I can't accept it. It's for your children. Why? Kristoffer makes so much money it's embarrassing. - And Vibeke has all she needs. - I really do. But don't you think it's weird? No, it's an interesting discussion. It illustrates the relative nature of money. What it means to have and not have it. Both symbolically and as currency. Do you remember KLF, the pop band? They received an art award some years ago. I think it was 100 000 pounds. They burned it. It was meant as a political statement, a performance. I don't know if it's great art, but it illustrates what money is. In its material form, it's paper. - What are you trying to say? - I'm not sure, but... Well, what mom is trying to do is also an artistic statement. A social commentary. On the one hand it's unheard of, crazy, as your reaction illustrates. But it's also an entirely good deed. Aunt Inger obviously needs the money. But the unconventional, even unacceptable, and the beneficial - - are so difficult to combine, and that's what I find interesting. I still don't understand what you mean. I'm sorry. I just think it's unpleasant. Maybe even more so now. Excuse me, it's humiliating. Think of the debt of gratitude she'll owe you. Come on. We're not doing it to earn her gratitude. Astrid, you must know that it would inevitably mean a debt of gratitude. But there's no reason to discuss it. It's completely out of the question. I'm grateful for the offer, but no. I think it's a great pity. Well, I don't know what to say. I wish I could make you change your mind. You can't. Well, I think it's truly sad. You know what? We can discuss it some other day. When you've digested it. I'll make some coffee. Tea, anyone? The view's different. Wasn't there a house there? Yes, an elderly couple lived there, remember? - So they passed away? - He died. Dad bought the house and land from his widow for next to nothing. The view's much better now. More open. It's nice. Pleasant. - There's some traffic noise, though. - I pity Aunt Inger. She sure has changed. I knew she was ill, but she can hardly walk. It's not that bad. She's no athlete, but she's had a hip replacement. I think she's doing okay. She hasn't changed. I just hope she accepts the money. She shouldn't let pride keep her from improving her life. - It's not just pride. - It seems harsh. Having to move from a house with a garden to a tiny apartment. She's in no shape to take care of a garden. Her apartment is small, - - but very practical. A lot of people live like that. If they can handle it, so can she. Too bad Ann-Kristin reacted that way. I didn't mean to hurt her. Of course not. But she's sensitive. She's daddy's girl, you know. Your saying he messed up financially upset her. Did it upset her? I didn't mean to say anything bad about Erling. - But it's true. That's how he was. - You think so? He never made much money, but didn't squander it either. I shouldn't have said he messed up. But he still lacked financial sense. You know, mom and dad helped him all their life. How could they do otherwise? They felt guilty because he got more than I did, but what could they do? - Did they help him that much? - Oh yes. He always came to them. You must have known. Well, I... You make it sound as if it was a great deal of money. He borrowed money for Ann-Kristin's confirmation, but we repaid it. - I'm almost certain of it. - Well, that may be true. It doesn't matter now, but... People are different. I sought independence. It was like that for Erling as well. He really tried his very best. He worked hard. But the jobs we had never paid that much. But it wasn't as if Erling was financially irresponsible. - Never. He hung in there. - He still had to borrow money. He borrowed from us as well. He never managed to repay it. Did he borrow money from you? When? How much did he borrow? - It doesn't matter now. - No, tell me how much he borrowed. - Well, 50 000. - What? 50 000? You can hardly get anything for a million these days. It's just this once. Why not think of it as development assistance? - You think it's comparable? - Sure, why not? It's about giving money to those who have less to improve their lives. Yes, but development assistance... Mom isn't poor. She's not rich. But neither am I. We all have some debt. Don't you? You must have a student loan? No? - I see. - I mean... Dad set up an education trust, so I never needed a student loan. But I don't own anything, and living in Berlin is cheap. Well, that explains it. You don't know what it means not to have money. I'm not poor, though I barely get by. You'll never be broke, even though you live cheaply in Berlin. You can afford to. You know the money's there. You make it sound as if I've got lots of money. I don't. - I don't regard myself as rich. - But you are. - You sure act as if you are. - Ouch. I mean, first you compare giving away a million to an art performance. Now it's development assistance. You must be spoiled to compare the two. Okay, maybe I'm spoiled. But why should that affect whether - - auntie should accept the money? I mean, the money means little to my parents, but would mean a lot to her. I don't buy it. I don't think the money means nothing - - to Astrid and Kristian. You may be right. A million hardly buys anything these days. But money means as much to those who have it as to those who don't. Maybe more, but in another way. Your parents will always know that they helped mom to her feet. And they'll always expect her to be grateful. They will. And she'll be ever so grateful. You'll drown in gooseberry juice. Should she forget to be grateful for some reason, they'll remind her. - No, they wouldn't. - Not because they're bad people. That's just how it is. Nobody gives away one million for free. Nobody does anything for free. - I have to pay it back. - With what? I don't know. I'll have to talk to Ann-Kristin. Listen to me. Don't worry. I've got a suggestion. Accept the money I've offered. Then we'll subtract the 50 000 as repayment of Erling's debt. - Then we'll be even. - Even? How can you say that? How will you otherwise manage to do it? You can't repay it yourself. You'll never be able to do so, Inger. I know you'll try as far as possible. I know you. You can hardly find a more honest person. Please accept the offer, Inger. Minus the 50 000. You'll have paid your debt. And then... You and I can take a trip to Paris. Come on. It can be your gift to me. - You always wanted to see Mona Lisa. - But you've seen it! Ages ago. "The Da Vinci Code" made me want to see it again. We've always talked about going there, just you and I. We can go to the opera as well. Imagine how much fun it'll be! Fun? Here comes the rain. "Good news for the farmers," like dad used to say. I'm sorry. I know you're trying to be kind. Don't think about it. Nice jacket. Is it from Berlin? I just want to say one more thing. You'll probably think it's completely idiotic, but I'll say it anyway. Because I think you're wrong. You say nobody gives anything away for free. But I actually believe that sometimes people do things for other reasons - - than personal gain. The past days I've seen how concerned mom is about Aunt Inger. There's genuine and mutual compassion. And that's precisely what the money represents. Just like the gooseberry juice. Auntie knows how much mom loves it. So she keeps making it for her. How can anyone drink it? It's way too sweet! I think maybe mom finds it a bit sweet as well. She hardly ever drinks more than one cup. That's not the point. Aunt Inger keeps making it for mom every year. Even though she no longer has her own gooseberry patch. And that's actually incredibly touching. Yeah, that's how it is. A million for a bottle of gooseberry juice that nobody really wants. - What did you talk about? The money? - Yes, a bit. She means well, Ann-Kristin. Look at this book of Ferdinand Finne's works. - "You Find the Way as You Walk". - Don't you think it's weird? No, although it's a very generous offer. It's important to show some gratitude, not just pout. - It's actually a very kind offer. - I know. It's just that... It's humiliating. I feel stupid. How can you say that? They're your family. Can't you just rise a fraction above your poor self-image? You're just like Erling. You mustn't become like your father. You know what I mean. He wasn't happy. You know that. He always felt inferior. Envied those who were better off. It'll only make you bitter and depressed. But I'm not like that. I don't want to feel that way. Well, what are you going to do? Just accept the money? - Sell out? - How can you speak to me like that? If anyone's being humiliating here, it's you. No, obviously I can't accept it. I know that much. But it would have been... I wonder if there's any way to accept the money without accepting it? Maybe I could suggest... Maybe I could ask them to buy a slightly larger apartment? They could own it, but I could live there. Then it wouldn't be as much a gift as an investment for them. That would have been fantastic. I could get rid of my mortgage. - Have you discussed it with Astrid? - No, I just thought about it now. - Would it be okay to ask her? - Hi. That looks delicious! - Hi! Already home? - As you can see. I thought I'd change before my dinner appointment. Look who's here! Inger! - It's been a long time. - It sure has. Hi. And Ann-Kristin. It's been ages! How are you? Condolences on your aunt. Astrid said she'd passed away. Yes, thank you. She lived to be almost a hundred. We sure have durable genes. We went to the funeral. It was magnificent. What a ride through the mountains! I haven't driven there for years. There are some great cabins there. I take it you've discussed our proposal? Yes, but it's difficult. Inger is so modest. Oh, have you grown modest in your evening years? Well, it's simply too much. I mean... I don't know if I can accept it. I honestly find it difficult. Yes, I understand. I don't know if I could have accepted it either. So I've come up with an alternative. What if we invest the money in a mountain cabin instead? For common use, of course. Not just for us, but for you as well. Astrid and I have long talked about buying something in Rondane. Now that we've got a little extra money, why not? For all of us. Inger could go there when she wants. Ann-Kristin could join us for a weekend sometime. What do you think? - Yes, but... Another cabin? - We've talked about it for ages. - Sure, but with that money? - As a gift to all of us. Well, I think it sounds like - - a good idea. - That's great. A mountain cabin. - Do you mean it? Yes, I do. Of course you should have a mountain cabin. You've always talked about it. We could go there together. Wouldn't that be wonderful? - What do you think, Vibeke? - I probably shouldn't say anything. But I think it sounds completely crazy. - Why? - We've talked about it all afternoon. Can you accept that much money? Then you just stroll in and say we should spend it on a cabin. It's so absurd it's ludicrous. Was that your plan all along? What do you mean? The cabin will be for all of us. A present that will benefit us all. Well, I hear what you're saying, but a cabin isn't what Aunt Inger needs. Okay. The offer still stands. It's up to her. - The cabin is just an alternative. - Well, I've refused, and I mean it. I think a cabin is a great idea. Of course you can have a cabin. - I agree. Buy a cabin. - Right. Astrid? Well, I'll see what's on offer. We could consider building a new one. But an old cabin has more charm. May I join you for coffee? I'll fetch a cup. What do you think? Well, it's okay. Though we might be better off using an actor. I'll call your publisher and hear what he thinks. But I think it's charming to hear you read it yourself. So we'll see. We'll get you that kitchen ventilator. We'll get it tomorrow. Do you have time tomorrow? I'll pay for it. You must have a ventilator, mom. Airing out isn't enough. I realise that, once I've thought about it. What's going on? - Did you forget to fill gas? - The tank was full! Where are you going? Ann-Kristin! Stay in the car! Stay inside, I said!
