And put a curse on the princess. "If she ever gets pricked by something before she turns 18..." She and everyone in the castle will fall asleep just like that. Nighty night for a hundred years! Unless someone comes along... Or someone without a horse who loves the princess a whole bunch and gives her a kiss. - But her dad... - The king... ...is still really scared. The witch might come back and prick his little girl! That's why he made her wear this suit of armor. That must have been really uncomfortable. And she had to wear it all the time! Even when she was almost a grown up already. - In the castle... - Of Fantabularasa! Mmm-hmm. So, you lost your key to your chastity belt again? Fear not. We've all been there. Mosey on down to Jebediah Rumplestein's. The fastest blacksmith in town! And if bedbugs are keeping you up at night - burn your mattress. - Oh! And now for the weather forecast from our very own Druid Steve. Princess? - Rose? - Jack! You're in danger! Dellamorta, she knows about our love. - Dellamorta! - She knows about you. Is she here? She has ears everywhere. And you are the only one who can lift her curse. - You have to hide! - Hide? Where? Somewhere safe. - Somewhere she won't find me. - Let's tarot it. Here, in a deep underwood - beyond the seven... Um. - Beyond the seven hills? Yes! Beyond the hills in the green woodshed. Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made. I thought that's just a fairy tale. You'll be safe there. Stay there until the celebration here at court is over. And in case Dellamorta's curse should come true, then you, my hero, will come back and save me and the whole castle with a kiss of true love. Yes, that's true. I love you, Rose. Here. For you.

Cling, cling, doesn't ring a bell. We didn't see anyone! No, no, dwarfs, you can admit it now. The charade is over, right? What charade? - Hmm? - On! What have you done with Jack? I know Jack!

Sorry, I was just deep in thought. - Which thought would that be? - I don't know. Thought so. Rose! It's all my fault. No. It's not all your fault. What do you mean exactly? Well, maybe a little bit, a teensy-weensy bit. Who would have thought that such a thick thorn would fit into such a tiny round ring? "Fault" is really the wrong world. Why is everyone asleep? It could have happened to anyone, any one of us! It could have been much worse. Unlikely. Huh? Bobo. Where are you going? I... I have to fix this. Somehow. Bobo, you can't even tie your shoes. Are you nuts? That's ridiculous. Of course, I can! I have to find Jack and bring him back here. But, what if you get hungry along the way? You don't even know the way! - Keep cool. - Huh? Good things come to those who wait. Who's going to remove the rocks in your path? And who's gonna tickle you when you're feeling blue? And who's gonna prevent that? Where am I? Who am I? What am I doing here? And what about Rose? Rose! I failed! Don't be too hard on yourself. The slide was great! - Yes, let's do it aga... - Forget it! All right, time to get a move on to save the scallion. Into the lion's den I go. Or the dragon's den may do. Whatever. Uh! Now the curse got me after all. Even though I hid in the grandfather clock. Shouldn't have drilled those air holes in it. I'm getting too old for this. Ah! Oh, oh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Confound it. I must save the scallion from Dellamorta's clutches. Don't worry. We'll take care of that. You? You have no chance. Why not? Dellamorta is powerful! And we are the seven dwarfs! My point exactly. Huh? You'll have to go across deep canyons, dry deserts, raging waters, over icy mountain ridges, to a place where no dwarf has gone before. - No! Don't fall asleep. - Stay awake! Please. You have to help us. If we can be helped. I feel I won't make it. Give me my bag. Here. I have three potions. This... this one here, will make you undefeatable. And this one will make you invisible. Huh? And this... what is this again? Huh? Oh, right. That's just floor polish. Dwarf huddle! We'll take the floor polish. - Is it lemon? - What? Oh, for heaven sakes. Think again. Remember, this will make you undefeatable. Aah! Now we understand, so we choose the floor polish. Hmm? Good luck with all that. Rose's fate is now in your hands. Haha! - Wait, wait. - Huh? What now, Bobo? Does anyone know the way to Dellamorta's hidden castle? Hello! Yes? Did anyone understand that? No! You? - He said... - Yes? Aah! Huh? - Follow... - Yes. What? Follow... sign post.. Ugh! Now, good luck. Sssh! - Snacks. - Lookin' good. Yeah! - Hey, look. - Hmm? The little signpost! That way, really? Hmm? Like the old man said, let's follow it! Yeah! Should I leave it open for when we come back? Coming back is not really the problem at this juncture. There's only one thing to be done. Blindly onward! Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Hey dwarfs, ho. Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Go, go, go. Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Hey dwarfs, ho. Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Go, go, go. Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Hey dwarfs, ho. Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Go, go, go Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Hey dwarfs. Huh? Oh! Haha! We made it. Oh! Is that...? Dellamorta's island. All we need now is a boat! There must be some around here somewhere. Does anyone have sunscreen? Get a grip, Sunny. Do you want me to get sunburned? If need be, yes. Don't argue guys. We're this close to getting there. Sunny, stop whining. I'm not whining. Oh, that's not whining? Those are sirens. What? Where? Fire? Is there a fire? Actually it sounds like mermaids. Unusual for this time of year. Mermaids! Man, jellyfish, I thought you brought this to Orca to get fixed. Yellow salmon swim upstream, you know? He caught himself a new one. Pretty fishy, man. Not a carp, dude. She's a carp all right, jellyfish. Did you check her scales? Forget it. Might as well go for the halibut you know what I mean? Give me some fin, man. Excuse us, might you possibly be able to assist us in some small way? Hey, what kind of lobster is this dude? Don't bother the lobster, dude. You know what I mean? Maybe Orca sent this guy. - Hey yo, you here for the Tang? - Enough with the sweet water. I said we don't have the dough. Are you mermaids? Jellyfish, man, what's up with that cod? What's all this fuss, Gus? Do we look like girls? We're Sherman and Herman. The Mermen! Haven't you heard of our new single? Seaweed Clan, A.K.A. Return of the Fishy Smalls. A.K.A. Merman's Paradise. - Hmm? - Hmm. Mmhmm. Seriously? Well, it'll be busting up the charts soon enough, okay? So, what you crawfish need? We have to get to that island. Huh? Oooh! Bad waters. Wouldn't touch it with my tail fin. Death lurks in every corner. It's dark, cold and scary. Don't forget the dragon. Man, he'll barbeque you. You crawfish really want to go there? We have to save somebody that needs our help. Jack. You little shrimps? Fat chance, dude. Hey, don't go all emo on them, man. Like your mama said. You only got no chance if you don't give yourself none. Okay, maybe we don't have a chance. But we're going to use it. - Come on, men! - Hey, hey, dwarf shrimps. Hang on a second. Huh? Hey, shrimps. You want to go for a joy ride? You have a boat? Yeah, we used it for our video. Everybody in the ocean Get your fins up. Get your fins up Get your fins up. Here comes the flapper, rapper Call me big snapper. Listen to the boys, yeah Every little oyster. Every little squid Make some noise, yeah. You go crazy Like the lobster in the pan. Get your fins up For the Seaweed Clan Ugh, how boring! Boring, fatso house cats. Outdated boots. Totally boring slime balls. Amphibians. Deadly boring princes and princesses. Even boring dwarfs. Boring old... I don't smell any dwarfs. They are gone. I hate dwarfs. Ugh. Ugh. What are they planning those tiny little creatures? Burner! Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Hey dwarfs, ho. Hey dwarfs, hey dwarfs, Go, go, go. Huh, what's this hole for? How else is the water supposed to get in? - Is that a good thing? - As good as a tsunami. Ralphie quick! Make another hole. - So the water can get out again. - No problem. What's so funny now? It tickles! Check. Gotcha. Oh, no! Huh? It's alive! Sure. See ya. ALL: Goodbye! One eighty two, 83, 84, 85 eighty six, 87, 88... Eighty nine, 90, 91, 92, 93... Seven hundred and twelve, 713, Seven hundred and fourteen... 715, 716... One thousand two hundred and four... 28,206... Oh, my. Shoot, I lost track. - Now I have to start again! - No! That's pretty steep. How are we going to get down there? Dwarf sleigh! Ugh, ready? Set. Ha ha. Go! Yahoo! Huh. Whoa. No, we're not doing that again. Guys, follow me! A dragon! Hmm. Keep cool. This dragon doesn't bite. Phew! Wow! Huh? Oh! Huh? Hello? Guys? Hmm. Hello? Are you there? Yeah. Hmm? Help me! Huh? Help! The dwarfs have escaped. Gone! Run away. I have no idea where those little pointy heads could be. But I won't take any risks. I can not allow them to free that kitchen boy. So, finish him. I want you to flamb him. Fully charred. Grill him! Barbecue him! And hurry up. Oh, we're too late. What did she do with Jack? Sorry. Let's ask him. You have any idea what happened to Jack? I'm Jack. Uh-uh. Says who? Can you prove it? Well, I'm the only one here. I think he kinda looks like a Jack, if you ask me. No one is asking you. I knew a Jack once. But he didn't look anything like him. Enough of this nonsense. We are on a mission. If you are really Jack, you should be able to answer one simple question. Two dragons are flying at the exact same velocity as two Canadian Barn owls at a combined weight of 3.2 pounds before the molt. After 21 minutes and 33 seconds, the first dragon meets up with the first owl. Forty-five seconds later, the second owl has lost three feathers. What time is it in Tijuana? 6:37 am. Absolutely right. Jackpot. Now that that's settled, could you unchain me? I really have to get back to save Princess Rose. But, of course, time is of the essence, gentlemen, I say, we blow the chains up. Could you just...? Maybe Ralphie could tear the chains off the wall. Sure. It's like they say, "Give me the place to stand, and I shall move the world." Maybe we should just detach his arm. Or we could wait for the sun, and melt the lock with a magnifying glass. Hey, just use the key. Huh? By the way, who are you GUYS? Who are we? We are the seven dwarfs. So, why are there only six of you? Two, three, four, five, six... Where's Bobo? Uh Oh. Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! I'm your friend! Huh? This is pointless. Huh... You, you can talk. Of course, I can talk. But no one ever wants to talk to me. But Dellamorta... Yeah, she only gives me orders. Oh, you're Burner? Uh-huh. My friends call me Burn. Problem is, I have no friends. What's wrong? I am burned out. Why? Dellamorta always makes me do things I don't want to. What kind of things? Bad things. You don't wanna know. So, just do things that you like. Hm! Uh! Forget it, no chance. Well, I like playing dwarf chess. Would you like to play? It's a board game. It's easy. Check! Your turn. - I don't want to. - No? Then, what would you like to do? - I'd like... - Yeah. - Oh, I don't wanna say. - Why? Because it's not what real dragons do. Come on. - No. - Please. No! Pretty please. But don't laugh. - Never. - I swear to you if you laugh... Hm, mm, hm, mm. L!!! I like tap dance. Huh? Leave me alone. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to laugh. Bobo! - We missed you. - We've got Jack. Hello. Let's get out of here. Take cover, dwarfs. Dragon at 12 o'clock. It's already 12? Nonsense. We're on daylight savings time. Shut up. Ah, Jack Little Man. I need your help. The dragon wants to jump off the cliff. Really? Yes. Great! But it's my fault. Well done. Back to Fantabularasa. You are a hero, Bobo. Let's get back to Rose. What? What? But I have to help him. Bobo, come back. Stop, stop, stop. Burnie! What? What did you just call me? Two good friends once said... You only got no chance, if you don't give yourself none. No. Sometimes you get lonely.

If I have to be honest... Maybe we are afraid. But if you were on our side... If we really want to win against Dellamorta, you're gonna need weapons. Hm. Oh! And where is your weapon? Wait, wait, wait. I, I just have to... I'm nearly finished. Whoa! Come with me. The great big dragon flies in a circle. Grabs its tail around itself. And lets the little dwarf fly right through. I did it. Here. I got it. I got it. Huh? I got it! I got it! I got it! Rose, my sword is out and here we come! Please place your pointy hats in an upright position. Huh? Burner!

If my ballistic calculations are correct, our point of impact will be right in the middle of the throne room. And if they are not? Then it won't be right in the middle of the throne room. Perfect landing. Jack. Thank goodness. You're alive. Come, all you have to do now is kiss Rose. Well, looky here. Visitors. Jack, Rose is counting on you. All right. Let him kiss her if he really wants to. Jack, what are you waiting for? A written invitation? I love... Dellamorta. Apparently, the boy is under the spell of my beauty. I love Dellamorta.
