We care two hoots for joy or despair.. Virtue and sin braided in our hair.. While we frolic without a care! Cos we are like this.. This is how we are! Our style is Bliss.. This is who we are! Each lane speaks of a different God.. One invokes Allah.. The next Lord Krishna! While blood flows in their veins.. The Holy Ganges flows in ours. The sun or moon without our summon.. Hide! Can't rise or set. l said 'hide'! Life's wheel in the hands of a brat! Cos we are like this.. This is how we are. We're almost Voguish.. This is who we are! At the riverside we float.. Look sis, a boat! Life's too short.. So never miss a ride! lt's time you taste our city's charms.. Start with a dip in the mother's arms.. Sweet 'rabdi' melts fingers and time.. Noon brings intoxication of 'bhaang'.. Lips blush with the redness of 'paan'.. Simple pleasures meant to disarm. Patna or Paris, whatever your route.. Swim here in your birthday suit.. Visit for comfort or for cheer.. Before death's arms carry you here. Cos we are like this.. This is how we are! This city is Bliss.. This is who we are! Hey, the match-maker! With her bag of loafers. Run with all your might.. From her ungallant knights! Run.. quick!! Uncle Rajju's freeloading again. His son is all muscle, no brain.. Greed is this duo's bane! No! l hope God blesses them. And keeps them far from us. Your nagging makes me shudder.. You're more like a brother! lf you had a moustache so.. Sis, l'd call you 'Bro'! lf you, li'l sis, had a tail.. You'd be a cow, big as a whale! Wonder why sis quit school? To fight with mom? No! To help her, fool! Why must mother toil this way.. Grinding life's miseries away. While father waits at home all day.. For Lady Luck to smile his way. l won!! Not 7-2, dad.. 7-1 ! Lost by a number, what fun! Life can be a sad abyss.. But never give your smile a miss. Cos we are like this.. This is how we are! l often wish to fly away.. Like a bird, free as day. And bring back with the night.. A few grains and some light. Cos we are like this .. This is how we are! Another classic sold to the recycling world! This will probably wrap peanuts. Lovely! This might wrap spices.. But the author gifted this to father. Think l'll keep it. But the weight is less. Chaucer's naval lint..! These classic gems are 'light weight' for you? Which classics? Anything is classic these days! This is literature, you jackass! Not your dad's graffiti! Don't get personal! My shoe will get personal with your bum! Your father's an old buddy of mine! So..? So l know your tactics well. You buy cheap and resell at triple the rate! Keep your gems. Talks like the Lord of Benares city. Bloody fool! -Control yourself! And for god sake change before the film crew arrives! Why bother! l know what is going to come out of it. More than the 'treasure' we get from your silly lottery tickets. Vibha: Ma.. ..they're here! Greetings, sir! This is Mr. Taneja and Ms. Sophia from Apex company Hi! Wow! That's awesome! Please sit. Pink lace..! lt's the latest fad on MTV! Mrs. Sahay's daughters, right? And your names..? l'm Vibhavri.. l'm Shubhavri.. Have you seen lots of shoots? lt's my job! So you've met Shahrukh Khan? Not yet! Not even a glance? During his morning walk.. or when he's buying milk.. Sophia! Look here.. - Coming. But.. Talk to you later. Star struck freak! l hope they know we don't want any breakages. They're paying you well, aren't they? They just want sir's room and the chandelier.. He'll never agree! l thought you needed money, so l got them here.. But if it's a bother, l'll.. - No! l'll convince my husband! l'm sure you will. l just hope they like this house. Please don't show them options. Don't fear.. when l'm here! Vibha: Ma, tea's ready! Daughter!! l'm serving. Sophia.. tea? Please eat something! Biscuit? They've got cream inside. This tea is superb. What's in it? Nectar! Nectar? Come on.. that's hilarious! Funny, isn't he? The schedule's for 30 days.. ..so we'll pay you 50 grand. Just for you, l'll make it 75 grand! This house is 1 75 years old. With 3000 books in it's library.. ..which my father donated. We'll take care of the electricity bill. l'm sure you have a phone. Just make sure long distance calls are possible. How much will that cost? A buck per minute. Very cheap! So Benares has a real Maharaja? How pretty! ls this a 'jhumka'? From? A neighbor's shop. l'll get you a pair too. Really? How sweet! What else can l get here? Our spicy snacks are world famous. Please sign this receipt. Hey, l need to see a traditional cabaret for research. Cabarets are illegal now! Though Dulari Bai will have a private performance tomorrow. But ladies not allowed. - Hey.. Shhh.. We'll take you there! l lost my little pearl, O'Lord.. Wow! Superb costume! She's so beautiful. You'd look prettier if we decked you up like a Christmas tree. Quiet! l lost my little pearl, O' Lord.. l wonder where it could be.. Sahay: First the ancestral jewelry.. ..now you're after this house. Sabitri: l'd sell it all in an eye blink. But Brother Rajju has a legal noose around our necks. l know we're going to lose our home when the hearing begins. You're pigeon hearted! All of Benaras knows that brother Rajju was thrown out by dad. Will the court take the city's word for it? He may be good for nothing.. ..but legally, he's elder.. ..and was born to the first wife. Atleast this white elephant of a house.. ..earned us 75 thousand from the shoot. Money.. money.. money..! Yes! lt's what consumes my head at night. What can l do? They stopped my pension because l wasn't corrupt. Should l have succumbed to dishonesty? Never. But you can only see chandeliers.. ..not my hands that sew night and day. Vibha had to quit school.. ..and the second one's fees cause a monthly fracas.. l lost my little pearl.. She's like a pendulum. Quiet! l lost my little pearl, O'Lord.. Don't..! We're in her room! Dulari bai: My eyes, my face seem the same.. ..so what have l lost? You've lost.. ..what the rich seem to have gained from you. Come here, little rat! Come here! What were you trying to see? Ma says 'Dulari doesn't dance..' '..she makes the rich dance to her tunes!' But l saw you dancing! Ma is right! Kiddo's blind! Stop it you two. l apologize on their behalf.. Such crystalline eyes! l hope the Lord protects their innocence. Come on, sis! Vibha: Mother will eat you alive! Chutki: That's if she finds out! How do l ask him, O' how l blush.. ..O' lord! Like we need another black sheep.. ..a bleating one at that..! Why'd you go there? Father will hear you. Ma, don't wake father! Father? No one gives a damn about the mother. ..'O how sis blushes! You brat! Sis! Enough, ma! lt's really late. How can l sleep with so much work pending? You sleep. And tomorrow.. ..get the payment for the whole consignment. Hello! - Hello.. May we get the whole payment this time? They're 25 medium and l'll give you half now, half later. But mother was hoping.. Sir, there's a bulk order.. Give her half the payment now. Awesome digestion, bro! Hogged the entire film crew money without a burp? What do l know? Ask her! l hope you know l'm still alive. lt's your addictions and this roguish behavior.. ..that compelled your father to throw you out. For him you were.. -Not dead yet! This house is sub-judice. When we win, you'll be out in a flash. And remember, half the film money is mine. How about half the expenses? You claimed the house a minute after father-in-law died. Do you really care so much for this house? The house weeps in the monsoons. The roof will probably fall this time. And this courtyard.. Enough, Sabitri! Why don't you stop him for a change? Chill, dad! She only understands legal jargon. The eviction notice will knock some sense into them. That film money will bring you bad luck, aunt! lmpudent boy! l'm being bullied by the child l helped deliver. And you're watching this silently? Silent? lf l had a robust son like him.. ..maybe l'd have a voice today. They're rascals.. not relatives! Rascals listen to money or muscles. We have neither. But there must be some way! Ma.. what's to eat? l'm hungry. Did you get the entire payment? No, ma. He said next time.. l'll set that fatty right.. Shut up! l'll lose my only client. Why are you always so scared? Brother Rajju and Ratan had.. Ma!! What happened? Stop lying. l'm not your step-daughter! Didn't Ma tell you we found you in a gutter? Ma!!! Now l'm really hungry. Stupid candles! Where are they, ma? ln the drawer. Which one? The consignment will be incomplete. But other homes have power. Did you pay the bill? How? Can't we use some of the film crew money, ma? Counter no. 2 will stamp the receipt. And you'll have power in two hours. l'll do it, father. Uncouth! What's up? Lives in a palace, acts like a King.. ..and doesn't have a penny to pay for electricity. Cranky old fart! How dare you? What did he say? Nothing, sir.. What do you mean? What did you say? l said nothing wrong. Beggars don't give speeches. Worthless clerk! Don't know your backside from your head.. Don't make me humiliate you.. ..l know your class. Father! What a wretch! What's the matter? His power was cut due to bill non-payment. ..showing us attitude! Just take this money. But, sir.. l don't want money.. l want an apology.. Hey..! Father! Ma, hurry! The rickshaw's here. Hello! Oh! We were just going to the hospital.. What's the matter? They have a problem. Don't worry, l'm sure she'll understand. Last night, some people protested outside our hotel. l don't understand.. Mrs. Sahay, the shoot's cancelled. We can't shoot anywhere in this city now. Ma, lets leave. But the advance..? You'll have to return that, aunty! Ma..! -Quiet!! Return..? l really feel bad.. So all your big talks amount to zero, huh? l'll get the money. The director's a coward. -So, big deal. Don't worry about a thing, father. Ma will be here any second now. l was in charge of crowd control. Even got permission to shoot at the river - what a waste! Money seems a little less. lt's ok! l'll consider it cancellation charges. Shall we leave, ma? Good bye. Sis, why don't you rest? l'm here. Ok. Ma! There's a new problem at every step. How much can l mend? l can't do this anymore. The film crew money was a slight relief. l felt l could breathe for a while. What will l do now? Nothing! lt's my turn to do something. Like what? A job. A school drop-out won't get a job. No one cares about that in Bombay, ma. Bombay? Alone, in that city? No. With Sophia.. from the crew.. That tailess chimp? Yes. lt's all set. They'll pay me 8 thousand. A job in Bombay? Even l wanna go.. Me too!! Eavesdropping again? Don't tell dad, you snitch! Where will you live, my darling? l told you it's all fixed with Sophia. Sophia? All fixed.. and you never told me anything? Never got a chance, ma. How much could l earn from sewing petticoats there? Ma!! You have a petticoat for brains! Sis..? l'm not naive like ma. Tell me the truth! -You heard! Did you really speak to Sophia? l was with you throughout. So l'll talk to her. Now sleep. Hello, Sophia! lt's me.. Vibha! Sophia: Oh! Hi! The job is confirmed, right? Sophia: What job? Thank you, Sophia! Sophia: What? And stay with you? Sophia: You out of your mind? lf you insist.. ..mother will be so relieved. Sophia: What? See you. Thanks! Hey.. Totally crazy, man! What happened? l think that chick from Benares is coming here! Will her father allow that? Father.. You won't achieve a thing and will return a loser. Wants to be a 'SON'! Always wanted a son, right? l'll become one. And l won't return a loser, watch me! Drink water after you've eaten.. Don't worry, ma! Say hi to Sophia for me. Go in, daughter. Study hard, li'l sis! And take care of father. And tell him.. What? Nothing! Take care, ma. l'll get there and call you. Send me a snap of 'Mannat'! What's that? Shahrukh Khan's bungalow. ldiot! Who? Where? Whom? To meet whom? That Sophia..? Sophia? 10. She returns at 10pm! Daughter..? lt's 10pm. So? She hasn't called yet. Train must be delayed. You have a visitor, ma'am! Mine? Who? Shit! Vibha! Sophia..! Babe, you can't just land up without calling.. l had. But that was.. ..come up now! What can l do? She just landed up. Don't know how long. A week l guess. Yeah, l'll handle it. Ok, bye! Vibha.. l promised to get you earrings. Oh, yeah! Thanks. How sweet! Who is it? Karan: Karan is my name! What do you want? Karan: Molesting girls is my game! Karan: Sophia, open the damn door. Karan: lt's me Karan, man! Wrong flat? Right flat! Hang on a sec. l see why my name and passport number were being asked! l'm Karan. l live downstairs. l'm Sophia's friend. Where is she? At a shoot. And you? Too many clothes - so can't be a model. Not her type, so can't be Sophia's friend. So you are.. Tina.. Mina.. or.. Vibhavari! Very good! Just arrived from Benares. So Vibs, tell Sophia.. ..'the beer has arrived, so let's party tonight!' Eh.. please give her the message! Bottle! Oh, ya! Bottle! Party, my foot! Picks up free booze from office and hogs a mini country at my place. Do you know call centers? He's a Group Leader there. Gets 50-60 grand a month.. with these perks. l've got a job for you tomorrow. Where the hell is Sasha? Get her fast!! Hey, where's Sasha? She's in the bathroom. For 45 minutes?? l didn't want to disturb her. Why can't you follow instructions? Sasha, open up! What? Hurry up! l can't take you back. You got in everybody's way! lt was my first time, l was nervous.. ln Bombay no one gets a second chance or a training period. No more shoots for you, sorry! A friend of mine owns a salon.. ..needs a temp for 4 days. You wanna? Oh, yes! Ok. lt's your sister. - Chutki..! Hello, Chutki.. Shubha: Hi, sis! Guess what! Three ruffians caught us on the road .. ..and said 'vacate your house'. Why would we leave our own home? Shut up! Wasting precious blood should be avoided. Or l could choke this sparrow with my pinky! This city has gone to the dogs. We should all come to Bombay. Or you come back! Stop your silly prattle! Please don't listen her. l've borrowed from too many people.. ..we might need a lawyer too. Sabitri: Can you send us some money? Sure, ma. Could you put sis back on.. Sabitri: Sure. Hi, sis! You're afraid of ruffians now? l'm so not!! But ma was there so.. Now tell me about your office. My office is a skyscraper. Haven't seen Shahrukh's house yet.. But soon, l promise. Loads of TV stars in my neighborhood. What a city! And the people are lovely. Car? l'll get one real soon. Lingerie..? Laundry? Lingerie, don't you get it? No laundry here! Can l help you, ma'am? Why can't you hire English speaking people? l'm looking for the lingerie section. l'll show you the right section. Our salesgirls must know English! Sahay: You won't achieve a thing.. Sahay: ..you'll return a loser. Sahay: Wants to be a 'son'! Vibha: Always wanted a son, right? Vibha: l'll become one. Vibha: l won't return a loser.. Vibha: ..watch me! Vibs..! lt's me Karan! Hi! Come in. Hang on, buddy! Sit! Vibs, this is Michelle! Michelle, this is Vibs.. ..l mean Vibhavari! The new inmate of Bombay prison! Hi! Hello! Do you know of any.. -Jobs? No way! l would'nt inflict my weird boss on you. But you know so many people. Help her out. Have a resume? We'll make one. For now, take down these contact numbers. Karan: We'll figure it out! Not a graduate? Any computer skills? Not yet. But l'm a very quick learner. We'd shut shop in a day if we started teaching everyone who walked in. No qualifications, no skill.. this resume is useless! So you're clueless about Event Management. Karan's such a weirdo! We'll call if something comes up. Please file this! See you! Sir.. You're Shivshankar Sahay? Court's notice for you. 'Shivshankar Sahay, son of Rudra Shankar Sahay.. ..is served a notice of eviction.. ..by Rajshankar Sahay, son of Rudra Shankar Sahay.. ..to leave the premises by 7th March.. ..and until a verdict is passed..' Sir.. sir.. Ma'am..? - What happened? l don't know what's happening to him.. l try to find you.. ..my heart heavy with dreams.. Hello, ma'am! Where were you? My room mate's back tomorrow. So you'll have to leave, ok? But where will l go? Figure it out, babe! But where.. Relax! This is Bombay. There's a solution for every problem. By the way, your mom had called. Karan? l need a job, now! 'Need a job now'! Wake up! Let me meet your boss! What for? Your qualifications.. l'd like to try.. once! Vibs, if it's money, l can give.. lt's not about money. lt's about a promise l made to my family and myself. l can't go back. Please help me. Karan.. - Sir! You'll get the papers for.. Hi.. l'm K.K. Gupta.. and.. This is Vibha, sir! l gave you her resume.. ..but you felt she's an undergrad.. -Oh, yeah! Come tomorrow, ok? No, no.. it's alright! Did you finish school? No, sir! There are always exceptions! But, sir.. You have a problem? No, sir! Come into my office. You should've attached a photograph here.. Damn! Daughter, ask someone.. Vibhavari Sahay!

But l'm very hardworking, sir.. l'll learn everything in a heartbeat! l like that! ln a 'heart beat'! Anyone from the Sahay family? Yes! We need one more oxygen cylinder. Why? Hang on, ma! All these medicines are needed? Yes, and immediately. Ma, give me some money. But.. Ma, think later.. You get going, l'll arrange for more. You don't have the qualifications. But don't worry.. ..you have a lot more! Come on.. l'm sure you understand! We can make an exception.. if you wish! Sir? lt goes like this.. l'm a lonely man. So why don't you spend a night with me? Do that and.. the job's yours. Come on, it's a deal. Don't you want the job? Yes? Vibha: Ma? lt's me! Sabitri: Now you call back? Sabitri: Your father is really ill. Sabitri: We've got a court notice. Ma, l'm coming back. People are wretched here. Stop ranting! 'Nice' people don't exist. Did you send some money? Your father needs a better hospital. Ma, there's no job. No office. No job? You lied? Sabitri: Your father was right. Sabitri: How can you be a son.. ..if you can't face a tiny hurdle. But ma, you're not listen.. l hear you.. They'll give me a job only if l.. My gold chain..? .. spend the night with them. There's nothing left to pawn.. Ma, l'm returning! -No! You can't!

Where is she? Sophia: Doesn't live here any more. Doesn't live here..? Sophia: Nope! Bye! Vibha..? Subha: lt's me, Chutki! Yes, daughter.. Subha: Why haven't you left yet? Subha: l'm waiting at the hospital.. l'm on my way.. Vibs, you don't have to do this. You're not like other girls, dammit! l hope Mr. Gupta doesn't complain about that! Shit! Hi! Come in. Come on.. You are beautiful! Ma? Why are you working in the dark? What's the matter? Ma?? So what time tomorrow? Same time, same place, if you wish. l meant to work. What time? Oh, your job! l'm so sorry! Want a drink? Well, Ver.. eh.. Vibha.. l can't give you that job. Not with your qualifications.. But you.. Company won't accept it. But you promised me a job, sir. So what? A beautiful girl makes a man promise anything. No, sir.. You know how it is.. You can't do this. Don't you worry though. You promised me a job, sir. l've got something for you! No, sir. l want a job like you promised. You can't go back on your word. Bloody bastard! That bloody piece of shit! Ma! Sabitri: My child! How's father? Fine! How are you, child? l was tense when you'd called.. Sabitri: l don't know what l said.. That decision has been made, ma. Take care of father. Now where? Sophia's..? Hello? Hi, Michelle! l needed a favor, babe! Could Vibha stay at your place for a few days? Thanks so much, Michelle. Key's in the usual place? Come in.. This is Michelle's pad. Stay for as long as you wish. She'll be here soon. Will you be ok? See ya! l'm sorry! Sahay: You will return a loser! Can't give you that job. Wants to be a 'son'. Oops! You can't return! Sabitri: Wants to be a 'son'! Sabitri: You're an adult. Do what you think is right. A beautiful girl makes a man promise anything. Dulari: Such crystalline eyes! Sabitri: Do what you think is right. Dulari: May the Lord.. l'm so sorry! Dulari: .. protect their innocence! Go mad thinking about it, or play their game on your terms. You decide. Come on, snap out! Karan's told me everything. l've lost, Michelle. No, you haven't.. ..not yet! They can break your trust, not your spirit.. ..the same spirit which brought you here to achieve something. You will find a Gupta at every step.. ..but if you want you could use them instead. And they won't be able to touch your soul. Do you hear me, Vibha? No! Not 'Vibha'! lf you decide to do this you'll need a new name. Shaina or Natasha? Gotta go. Bye! Hey, you forgot your money last night. What? Don't try those tricks. Black mail and all. l get it. That's all l have right now. Though you're worth much more, right? You couldn't afford me if you sold yourself to the highest bidder. Next time, pay the full price for your whore.. ..don't break someone's trust with a lie. Natasha! My new identity - Natasha! Right! Now remember.. ..you don't belong to the streets.. ..you're a high level escort. Top of the heap! Exclusive and very expensive! Hey, hold on! Are you out of your mind? Vibs, this is not your cup of tea. You have no idea what this entails. Listen, Karan.. - One sec, Michelle! Hold on! Vibs, don't listen to her.. - This is my decision! ln the midst of a storm, my feet are still.. Each breath choked, my voice is mute.. l fight to live, defeated by self.. l am the mirror and it's drugged reflection. l've fallen from grace. How do l hide my tainted self? l've fallen from grace. How do l find my way back home? l've fallen. Like white noise, it echoes inside.. Like the devil it snakes inside.. As l try to piece my shattered soul. l am my modesty, it is my veil.. We are tainted; we are torn. From untouched modesty of an untouched self.. ..l've fallen. How do l look them in the eye? How do l find my way back home? How do l hide my tainted self? Hi, l'm Natasha! Sis, has sent us so much money, look? Father, sis has sent us money! l've ended. l've ceased. l'm black. l'm white. l'm the sand in a rainless cloud. The black of the night. The flicker of the flame. l'm a dream. An apparition. My own shadow l fear. Like a damp twig, l burn, l sear. l am illusion. l am shade. l am flesh. l am soul. l am still. l am mute. l am resolved. Butalia: Like your new apartment? lt's really nice. Not as gorgeous as you.. ..but l guess, lt'll have to do. Butalia: See you soon. Bye! Sahay: O - 6 - 5 - 8. That's what l call a lottery! Subha: He asks about you daily.. Let me talk.. Shall l? Sahay: Hello? Hello, father.. Sahay: How are you, daughter..? Just don't worry about money anymore. We'll get the best lawyer possible. Alright. Have the house repairs begun? ln full swing. Vibha: Please get marble. But that's expensive, child.. Doesn't matter.. l've got to take another call, father. Go ahead, daughter. Wait till Brother Rajju meets our hotshot lawyer in court.. The lawyer won't take less than 10 thousand. But Vibha insists we go with him. She's a 'son' now. Our son! Dad's hogged all the snacks - can l have some more? What's up? lsn't everything ok now..? l've fallen from grace.. Your uncle has hired the city's top lawyer. He doesn't have the balls. He's grown them overnight. What's the source of this windfall? Putting marble in their courtyard! How? Have you met my PR associate? Natasha. l hope you'll join us for the conference. Of course, she will. What conference? The Patents and Trademarks conference is in Zurich. You're coming. But you didn't even tell me.. l was going to.. Hello, Natasha! Hello, Sunil, my boy! Are you going to tell us about your project? l'm just about to make a short presentation. Get to work, idiot! Sophia? Sorry for the delay, ma'am.. Vibha?? You're totally changed! Looking damn good. Why didn't you call.. ..maybe because l moved. Clearly your life's rocking.. ..while l'm still stuck in the same rut. l wish l had your luck.. Don't even wish that by mistake. Natasha! Natasha? You're really lucky for me, Natasha! You've made every contract, every collaboration a success Just a coincidence. A businessman shouldn't be superstitious. Businessmen don't like risks. You'll get the Zurich tickets tomorrow. Hello, ma! How are you, my child? Vibha: l'm well. l hope the money reached you? Yes. Your sister has graduated with flying colors! Really? Sabitri: She'll get a great job. Sabitri: Your father's well too. Everything's fine. Come back, my child.. Come home! What are you saying, ma? Haven't you understood yet? l can never come back! Ever!

Thy will be 'done'!! Done..! l'm going to die because of your stupidity! lf l knew l was going to fly, l would've tattooed it on my arm! Captain: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. We're experiencing some turbulence. Kindly fasten your seatbelts. lt's just an air pocket.. happens! ls that why my hand is turning blue? Oh.. sorry! Our Father, who art in Heaven.. Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. So you're here on work! Yes. On a Trademarks and Patents conference. Life never ceases to amaze me! Now what are Trademarks and Patents? When big companies are done manipulating developed countries .. ..they start exploiting developing countries.. .. through Trademarks and Patents. Good morning! The city of Bern welcomes all the delegates of the World Patients.. Oops..! Patents and Trademarks.. Hi there! -Hi! How was your flight? lnteresting. Good. ..The renowned Patents and Trademarks attorney from lndia.. ..Mr. Rohan Verma! Good heavens! Good morning! lt's a pleasure to see you all here today. Everyone sees Patents and Trademarks in their own unique way. But l heard an entirely original definition of this today. We might understand developing economies slightly better. ' When big companies are done manipulating developed countries..' Do you know him? Not really! Hello! You're such a liar. l don't even know you, Mr. Verma. But l know you! You like sugarless coffee. Very devout. l know how you look asleep.. ..l know lots! Have you two met? Rohan this is Natasha, our new PR and Business Manager. Hello, Natasha. - Hello, Rohan! l'm off. Have to go to Nice tomorrow.. ..So why don't you take a day off. Ok. - Just chill. See ya! Take care.. have a good flight. So, what's the plan? Plan? What will you tell Chicky and Micky? Who? Your grandchildren! 'l went to Switzerland.. ..and l explored the hotel room and the airport!' As opposed to? As opposed to the real Switzerland. The Alps, the churches.. ..the quaint restaurants.. ..where you get the world's best cheese fondue and rosti.. That's it. l'm hungry! Change. Meet me in 5. l hate these conferences. Me too. Really? What else do you hate? Pumpkin or banana? Bottle gourd or bitter gourd? Litter bugs. Smelly cabbage. And you like..? Hot tea in earthen cups. 'Holi' revelry! The smell of wet earth. A couplet maybe. Evening by the river. The festival shiver. Old film songs. Maybe an ex-flame? Your turn.. Cricket or football? None at all. Blue skies. Pine and maple. Oh, come on! Bikini or shorts? Anything blue! Make a song.. Smile along.. A stranger in a strange land.. ..was your friend all along. Make a song.. Smile along.. Steal a moment from life.. ..lt's time to play along. Make a song. ln a juicy ''paan's'' medley.. ..l was at the Ganges, merrily.. ..when a stranger came along.. ..and struck my heart temporarily. To drown in mystic eyes was fated.. Magic, mirage, or was l intoxicated? Such naughtiness in a foreign land can't be clever.. Behave! Have you no shame what so ever? Make a song.. Smile along.. Come along.. Steal a few sunny beams.. ..from your wild dreams. Make a song. lt's a tiny happy drop in an eternity.. That's life's ironic ditty. This is what will stay with you.. ..so make it count, make it true! l was swept away by a rogue wave.. ..the colors, the sights, the effects were grave. See this medley of colors, this incredible fusion.. ..a new song, a happy confusion. Make a song.. Smile along.. A stranger in a strange land.. ..was your friend all along. Make a song. l'm craving hot ginger tea and 'pakodas'. Oh, man! 'Kachori', 'samosas', 'jalebi' and 'parathe'.. Croissant, sir? Oh, no! Yes, please. Hello? Michelle? Who? Excuse me, may l have your pen, please? Yeah, ok! Excuse me! Sir, ma'am says she won't be able to join you. Enjoy your breakfast and have a nice day. Ratan: Hello? Ratan speaking. Are you dumb or mute? l'm right here. Arrived before time. Bless this swank car! Your job's truly lucrative. The chicks back home dance for peanuts. Don't talk rubbish. Well, that's the heart of the matter. Now l know the source of uncle's windfall. Brother.. Don't call me that. You didn't come all this way to tell me this. So l'll come to the point. lf the truth of your 'job' was to come out in Benares.. ..your father would be the first to.. What do you want? Money. How much? Take it and leave.. Not so fast. Here's a letter to your bank.. ..instructing them to transfer 25 grand to our account every month. lt's not much. l know your rate per night. Now sign. But no one back home can know anything. How do l know you will keep your word? No guarantees there. But only a fool kills the goose that lays golden eggs. And l ain't no fool! Sister!!! This city doesn't know what's going to hit it. Now that we're together.. ..we're going to paint this town burgundy! How come.. you..? You're stammering out of excitement, sis! l've got a job here. l'm a management trainee at Matrix Advertising!! But how'd you enter..? Oh, l had to plead with the watchman. And ma tried calling you so much. Anyway.. ..look at your castle, sis! You must get me a job like yours in event management. We're going to have a blast, aren't we? 'Cos we are like this.. Are you going to be a brat at work too? Absolutely! Sis, how did you find a mini Benares here? This is 'Baan Ganga'! Reminds me of home! Like it? Now this is.. home! This is who we are! l welcome the trainees to their first session. Lux.. this agency's biggest brand. Here's a sample of their target audience.. Vivaan! For god sake, wake up, man! Vivaan's dead. Death by boredom! So your task is to capture the consumer so tightly in your fist.. ..that she doesn't dream of another soap. Sir! Not in our fist.. in our heart! What's your name? Shubhavari Sahay! Continue, please. We can't win our target audience's heart by not respecting them. l mean, she's more than a statistic, sir. We need to understand her dreams and aspirations.. ..and make a place for ourselves in her heart. We're the ones in her fist! Vivaan! She's got brilliant insights. Vivaan can handle the creative. As a team, they'll rock! Yeah. Oh, Shubhavari! Yes, sir! Meet Vivaan tomorrow morning.. ..and get a complete low down on the Lux campaign. Ok, sir. Good luck. Babe, you're lucky! l've been lusting over Vivaan for 2 years.. ..and you're already in. Oh, God! He's hot! Y-e-a-h! What crap! Looks like he hasn't showered for a month. And advertises soap! So you give him a scrub! This is his last campaign. He's being posted to Paris after this. You're so lucky! He's the lucky one. He got to work with me! l floored those Bombayites on day 1 . Weren't you nervous? And where did you learn all this? l wasn't flying kites in my MBA course. Sis, where did you learn such fab make-up? l wasn't flying kites.. ..for so long in this city!! But, sis.. be careful here. This is not Benares. That's what's so great! New city, new life, new people.. ..anything can happen! Exactly! Anything can happen. So you haven't liked anyone so far? Be honest! Not in this city. Oh!! So where did you like someone? l'm off, sis! Come on! l've come and you're going.. You know event management has crazy time lines. Bye. Everyone's in a rush, ma. Like they're in a race.. Oh, Lord! And the city's full of loony characters! You got me, dude! Oh, the lndian woman herself, eh.. Shubh.. Shubhavari! l'll call you Shubhi! l'm Vivaan! Hi! l'm sorry! l don't hug on my first meeting. So, what's up? Well.. Hello! What time? So you know all about the modern lndian woman. What do you think about her? Sir.. Vivaan, please! Vivaan.. ..l know as much about her as you do.. ..about this lady! She's modern, but probably not lndian. And this one's modern? Yup. Sunita Jadli - MD Gynaec.. runs her own hospital. She's the modern lndian woman. And the potential consumer of Lux. The one you want to capture in your fist. Not in our fist.. ..like you said.. ..'ln our heart'. Yeah.. ln our heart! So what's the difference between the 2 chicks? One will spend 5 grand in an evening.. ..the other in the entire.. - Want some coffee? Quickly!! So they're coffee buddies now! Vivaan is Vivaan! Your 'lndian woman' definition's warped. These chicks are merely lndian, not modern. lt's so typical. Just like a man. You judge a book by it's cover. lf clothes were the parameter then you'd be a complete.. Loser.. huh? Yeah! You should be. Who can tell that this mayonnaise dripping freak.. ..is the creative director of a big agency? Where are the frikkin' coffees?? Why are you smiling? l just figured you out.. You figured me out? You're a male basher. You hate men. l don't. You do. You don't know it. l don't hate men. - Hello! Today's Tuesday? l'm in the car, man. Alrighty, ma'am.. gotta go! May we continue your discourse later? l hate men.. l told you! You hate men. l just love Bombay, ma! lf we were all together, we'd have a blast! lt's beautiful. No, l haven't been able to see Shahrukh yet! Yeah, sis and l are going out for dinner. Sis, look! Call girls! Nothing, ma! Talk to you later. Look, sis! l wonder where my pearl.. Stop it! They're girls, just like us! With just different circumstances, compulsions.. Sorry, sis! Nothing justifies this! Choose anything.. but not this. l don't agree! How can you disagree? Of course, this is a date. This is not a date. So l was joyous for nothing? l was sure the lndian woman's changed when you asked me out. What are we doing here? My assignment! Of course, your assignment. l need to show you the real lndian woman. Though.. the lndian male is changing too. He actually buys a new shirt sometimes.. Nice? -Very! Nice tags too! - Oh! l'll do it. -No, l've.. l've got it. - No, l've got it.. Look at her! Nice! Hot! Sexy! Slim! And works out like a beast daily! Obsessed with one thing - dieting.. dieting.. Dieting..? l'm sure it's fat free. Look at those ladies. They're hands are in pizzas.. ..but their minds are in yummy road-side snacks. Yummy! Hrithik's yummy, isn't he? No! John's hotter. And her? ln a tearing rush.. Possibly late for her kid's PTA. Rubbish! Excuse me! Are you in a rush? Yes. l've a flight to catch. A vacation? No! l'm the pilot. Spicy, snappy and so aggravating.. She hit me like a bolt of lightning! Spicy, snappy and so aggravating.. lt's not working, man! Come on, guys! Think out of the box. One second. Just let that hair fall.. natural. A little giddy.. A tad silly.. With rare serenity.. Casts her charm on me, this fiery chilli! Hello! All set? Shall we see the presentation once? l don't have a presentation. What do you mean? Don't know! l'm blank. Completely confused. My first presentation.. my job.. - Ok.. ok.. relax! Look at you! Relax! Go freshen up! Go! But there's no.. No presentation. l know. We'll figure it out. Get yourself a cup of coffee. Hi, guys! The quintessential lndian Woman.. ..who and where is she? We looked for her for days, but in the wrong places. She's actually right here.. ..but we couldn't see her. Computer and cell phone savvy.. ..but she never fails to pray. On top of things at work.. ..but family comes first. She's groomed and dressed for success.. ..but her smile is her biggest asset. Honestly, she's got it, and she's got the face for it. The new average Jane is a bombshell with a brain. Nothing and no one can stop her flight. And that's the Lux woman we're looking for. The one we wish to capture in our heart, not our fist! This daft boy, half crazed.. Has set my heart ablaze! This daft boy, half crazed.. Has set my heart ablaze! An occasional stammer.. Sings with such candor.. Such a lying enchanter.. Cast his net on me, silly gander! Sister, l'm going to Lugano.. ..near ltaly.. yes, on a shoot! A wizard walked away with my senses.. Stupefied, l dropped my fences. Chatty, naughty and full of beans.. She'll drive you nuts, she's got the means. A little giddy.. A tad silly.. A prancing philly.. Cast her charms on me, this fiery chilli! Silly billy! Spicy, snappy and so aggravating.. She hit me like a bolt of lightning! This daft boy, half crazed.. Has set my heart ablaze! An occasional stammer.. Sings with such candor.. Such a lying enchanter.. Cast his net on me, silly gander! A green chilli in a vodka shot.. O' Lord! What a nuisance l've got! 'Cos we're like this.. This is who we are! Drinking with him is such a bore.. But he saves me from villains galore. Usually grounded, he gets high like a bird.. And hides his dimples, this bearded nerd! A little giddy.. A tad silly.. With rare serenity.. Casts her charm on me, this fiery chilli! Spicy, snappy and so aggravating.. She hit me like a bolt of lightning! Good show, guys! We have a winner! Chutki.. Who's bike were you on? Bike? Vivaan's..! l told you about him.. You've just stepped into this city.. ..and you're already flirting with boys. Sis..? What? What do you know about him? Who he is and what he's really about? You don't know this city of wolves. They'll tear you apart and you'll break into so many pieces.. ..you'll never be able to heal. Like you never existed! Never! Sis? This is me.. your little sister. What happened to you? l'll tell you everything! l'm dying to talk to you about it. How about some tea and 'Vivaan' post-mortem? Sis, could you pass me some of that..? What? That.. dark stuff.. - Mustard seeds? No, that.. Nigella Seeds..? What's that?? No!! That brown stuff that turns dark later.. Cumin seeds, sis! Oh, thank you! Our tuning's awesome, isn't it? Cumin in pasta..? What do the ltalians know! Taste pasta.. Vivaan ala mode! lncredible! l've never had a more delicious cumin pasta! So l'm pretty and talented.. ..and a pretty talented cook too. So if the agency kicks you out in Paris.. ..you can always start a restaurant. No, Paris is going to be tough.. ..luckily Shubhi will be with me. He's kidding, sis. He's gone mad. What do you mean? Nope, l'm serious. l was thinking that we could.. ..marry and go to Paris together. With your permission, of course. Vivaan? Have you gone loony? Or..we could live in sin there.. ..what say, big sister!! You know what l mean! You haven't even asked me yet.. l haven't?? Dear lady, forgive me! Allow me to propose now. Shubhi.. ..you've turned my whole life upside down. And l completely love this new life. And l want to live in it forever. Ms. Shubhavari Sahay.. ..will you please marry me? Sis..? Are you nuts? Say 'yes'. What do l do..? Yes or no, babe.. ..have mercy on my knees atleast. Yes.. yes.. yes! Bless you! First tell me.. ..how in God's name did you agree? Scram.. Hey!! You sit with me, come. This is the limit! l can't believe this oaf has landed such a lovely girl. Gran, you've only met Dr. Jekyll yet.. ..wait till you meet Ms. Hyde! Vivaan! lf only you knew how many girls pine for me! My noble heart felt sorry for this poor villager, or else.. ..Or she'd leave you too. Yeah! Gran!! Wait! Welcome to our family, child! Vibha: Ma, Chutki's got a proposal. His name's Vivaan. He works in her office. With her? Has a home in Bombay too. Sabitri: Really? Ma, his family's coming to Benares. But they want a quick wedding. Vivaan is going abroad in 20 days. No, daughter. How can we manage this in 20 days? Vibha: Easily, ma! Don't you worry! Chutki and l will manage everything in Benares.. ..and in no time. l've already designed her trousseau. But we'll buy her saris only in Benares. lt'll be so much fun. Sabitri: But, daughter.. Yes, ma.. Tongues have started to wag. They say we've become too rich, too quickly. You understand, right? Sabitri: l fear your coming here might.. Sabitri: Daughter..? You understand, right? Yes, ma, l do. You're absolutely right. l won't come. Don't worry. l'll handle Chutki. Daughter..! Oh! Chutki must take her vows in our traditional sari.. ..you know which one, right? l should go now. Bye, ma. Sahay: Where are my spectacles? How do l hide my tainted self? How do l find my way back home? l've fallen from grace. l don't have patience for this wedding stuff. Let's elope. ln this trolley. You know what l mean. - l do. You do? Then listen.. .. One last kiss? - 'Last' kiss. Yeah. Vivaan, leave. l'm waiting for sis, remember? So wait on. l'll check her in just in case she's late. Ok, wait.. Really.. honestly.. come here.. Don't jump again! l'm gonna miss you. l'm not gonna miss you. l told you, you hate men. l don't hate men. l hate you! l love you, but.. Bye.. Bye.. Sis, where are you? l was just about to call you. Our flight's been.. What..?? What do you mean 'can't come'..? Office work.. Now? But your luggage is with me. Why can't you tell them something? Come on, sis.. hello? Yeah! l'll be there in 45 minutes. No, l don't need a car. l'll be there. Sis? Hurry up. Your damn door's jammed. Get the luggage. Sis!! Take this upstairs, please. Come on.. quick. Follow the black car. Pick up the phone, sis! Drive faster! - There's traffic, ma'am! But that black car is zipping. -l'm trying to follow. You're a crappy driver. Come on!! Stop here! Sis..!! How much..? - Ninety bucks. Don't have change.. Just keep it. Ms. Natasha! Good evening! Mr. Collins is waiting for you.. -Natasha? Who was that lady? Ms. Natasha! Comes here often. She's a permanent guest here. And meets her friends here often. Friends..? Like l said, she meets them here. lsn't her name Vibhavari? No! Not at all. She's Ms. Natasha! Subha: That's what l call a lottery! Vibha: ..crazy time lines in event management. Subha: ..look at your castle, sis! Subha: ..get me a job in event management. Subha: How did you learn such fab make-up? Vibha: l wasn't flying kites.. Subha: ..for so long in this city!! Steward: Ms. Natasha! Subha: ..'O how sis blushes! Vibha: You brat! Subha: Sis..!! Vibha: Li'l rat! Stop the car! Chutki..? Natasha..? Sis! Please listen.. Sis..? You're disgusted, aren't you? l know what you must be going through. But l never thought.. ..or wished for you to find out. Believe me! Just wished for you and Vivaan to make a life l'd stopped dreaming of. l didn't want the shadows of my world to fall on you. That's why l wasn't coming to Benares. Forgive me, sis. l've shattered your faith. l've shamed you. l'm sorry. Forgive me! Shut up, sis. Just shut up! Don't you dare apologize to anyone.. ..to me, mother.. or even father. l ask for your forgiveness.. Don't.. .. for all of us. How could we have become so selfish? So blind? How could l not read your eyes? Why couldn't l feel your pain? l fight with the whole world.. ..but l couldn't save my own sister. l'm so sorry! Forgive me, sis! You thought you'd keep sacrificing and we wouldn't find out? You'd keep selling yourself.. ..for the house.. ..for dad's medical bills.. ..for my education, my wedding? Did you really think we'd build our dreams on your grave? Enough, sis! No more. There will be no wedding without my sister. No, Chutki.. Yes. You will come with me. Come, sis.. let's go home! Sis is here..! Sis is here..! Ma! Daughter? You've become so thin..! Chutki just wouldn't listen. She was so adamant.. Just pray that everything goes well.. Ma? Speak. Oh, really? l think Ms. Big Bucks from the big city should speak. l don't have time for riddles. Come to the point. Then listen.. ..ask your bloody lawyer to come to an understanding with dad. Pay us and we'll withdraw the case. Got it? We're winning and you want to compromise with those devils? By paying them? Exactly! Why? Explain, sis.. Explain what? We're away.. ..ma and dad are alone in this legal mess. What if they send goons? Burn the house? Who will protect them? Reminds me of father. He had the same tone.. ..and would toss his plate in anger just like this. Let's eat.. ls this still necessary, ma? Sis! Sis! Coming. Oh, hello! Our respects! She's quit everything ever since her patron expired. Ma'am..? Oh, the little rats! Where have you been? ln Bombay.. Lets see.. Just the same. They couldn't rob that innocence. But they tried real hard. lt's my sister's wedding. You must come. Congratulations! ls the groom here? Sabitri! They are here. Ma, this is Vivaan. Hello! Please meet my grandmother. Greetings! Please sit! Bless you, son! What a lovely family! l pray that the Lord keeps the evil eye away from you. My elder brother, Rohan! Bro, this is Shubha, her parents.. ..and her elder sister! Our father who art in heaven.. l believe the groom's here. What the hell are you waiting for? Savoring the silence before the storm! Stormy silence, huh! Sneaking around? Get inside! -But.. Look at the tall rat l found, ma? Pining for your bride, weren't you? Go on.. leave! Scoot! Here we go now! Sounds fresh! That's right..! Now don't you go plucking buds.. ..or the gardener will kick your butts. Now don't you go plucking buds.. ..or the gardener will kick your butts. Ladies, we beg your pardon.. ..we're here for the whole garden! Ladies, we beg your pardon.. ..we're here for the whole garden! Gardener, your blossoms are too cool.. Row after row, like a flowery spool.. We're hungry bees, so love sick.. ..we'll gladly get our butts kicked. Now don't you go plucking buds.. ..the gardener will kick your butts. Their cheeks are dimpled.. Their ears have bells.. Eyes have a drunken swagger.. ..but.. but.. but.. Eyes have a drunken swagger.. ..but lips cuss like a sailor! You're bulls, not bees.. Your singing makes us flee! Tie them with a thick yarn.. ..take them back to their stinking barn! Don't go plucking buds.. ..the gardener will kick your butts. Yeah, yeah! We the cool champions. Always number one. Never play with us. We the son of a gun. Try so hard to challenge us.. Fall flat on your face.. Beware! l'm young and beautiful.. Stay away! My eyes are magical. You'll regret it. Get away! Don't scream.. Don't shout.. Be gentle with us.. Break it down! Don't scream.. Don't shout.. My delicate arms.. We're on the hook.. We're on the line.. You can't sing or rhyme. Time for some real music.. And real rhyme.. These bees cause upheaval.. We know they're pure evil. Go gently.. Go gently into that night, young bee.. These bees cause upheaval.. We know they're pure evil. They try to look so cool.. ..with brains in their drool. Listen up, lovely buds! lf it wasn't for us, you'd be duds. lt's 'cos we come here often.. ..you stay green and not lonesome. Don't go plucking buds.. ..the gardener will kick your butts. Ladies, we beg your pardon.. ..we're here for the whole garden! Gardener! Your buds are too cool.. Row after row, like a flowery spool. We're hungry bees, so love sick.. ..we'll gladly get our butts kicked. Sis, the caterer is calling you. Now what? l'm coming. Did you send for me? No. But Jhurri was looking for you.. Jhurri? Not Jhurri.. l sent for you. What are you doing, Rohan? Nothing yet. l just.. wanted to say something. Not now, Rohan. l should be with sis. l know.. Look, l'm not good at this. l'm very unromantic and.. ..know nothing but Patents and Trademarks. l used to laugh at love and mushy stuff.. ..but after Zurich.. l don't want to see you in my dreams.. ..but by my side. Rohan, please.. Messed it up! l can do better. One sec.. l want to hold your hand through every air pocket in life. Please, Rohan.. ..don't even think this. Why? l fell in love praying with you that day. Today at the banks of the holy Ganges.. ..l ask for your hand. Even the logic is perfect. No, Rohan. You know nothing. Absolutely nothing! Vibha.. ..refuse if you wish.. ..but l think we're friends enough for you to tell me why. No. We're not friends enough for me to tell you the reason. Has everything reached? Yes. And the sweets? Yes, mother. What's the matter? Why so worried? Nothing at all, ma. Don't you girls have to get dressed? What is it? Tell me, child. Ma, there's a proposal for me. What.. a proposal? Whose? Rohan! No, child.. no! l'd told you! l knew it. lt's for the main hall, ok? l feared this very moment. Why did you come? Why? Who were you stopping, ma? The daughter who saved us all? Chutki! Who saved father.. ..who saved you from crumbling.. Shut up! ..was responsible for my education! Who saved everyone.. ..but couldn't save herself. You shut the doors on that daughter, ma? Don't interfere, Chutki. l will. Because you won't utter a word. Such injustice? You've carried the entire burden alone, sis. Try to understand me.. ..he's asked for your hand.. ..what can you possibly do now? lf you refuse.. ..it impacts Chutki. lf you say yes.. ..then both your relationships will have.. ..a sword dangling over them for life. No, daughter! Wait here. l'll do something.. No, mother. You won't. Sis, you have to do something.. ..for yourself, this time. Say 'yes'! Then l'll have to tell him the truth. So be it. Don't worry about me. lf a bond can't bear the truth.. ..then its best that it breaks. No.. Yes, sis! Now go! Daughter! l thought.. ..Vibha's wedding was not to be.. ..thought l'd see you married at least! l tried so hard.. ..but l lost. Enough, mother. Enough! Used to see your tear-soaked pillow every morning.. ..but l understand it now. You'd toughen up for us every morning.. ..and crumble every night. Even met good news with a sombre face. Share the burden today.. ..all the tears.. ..Let it all out, ma! l failed as a mother. l couldn't save my own daughter. Mother and father.. ..you were both. l left you alone in the storm.. ..you were all alone. This is all my fault. All my fault! You sent for me? You were right. l think we're friends enough.. ..for me to owe you a reason. l'm not an event manager. l'm an escort. A sophisticated version of a prostitute. That's it. l won't insult you with any excuses. l did what l had to.. ..to earn a living. l don't regret it. But why should you bear this cross? Why should you be tainted? But my sister's purer than the Ganga. l beg you, Rohan.. ..don't let this ruin her happiness. l beg you. l used to love you a lot.. ..but today.. ..l respect you more than that. You think l didn't guess.. ..back in Zurich? l've seen your boss' new PR managers for years now. But never one who prayed. Taint? Cross to bear..? What are you talking about? To me, you are the Ganga herself. Rohan, you don't know.. l don't know anything.. ..except that.. ..l dread living without you. So if you can bear.. ..living with someone.. ..who doesn't even know his prayers.. ..if you can spend your life with me.. ..then l think that life should begin right now. Just say 'yes'. Sis.. ..please say 'yes'! The dude's not half bad.. l assure you. Say yes, sis! Stop bleating! You guys start whipping a drum at the drop of a hat. This is not a wedding. lt's a shameful event in my grandfather's house. But you can't hide the truth. Hear me out.. ..then decide if you want to witness this wedding. Not one, but two weddings! Hey!! Dropped your brains somewhere? No, you have! She's right! Let me see who tries to stop us. And speak with caution. The women of this house are its pride. So beware when you utter something.. ..you get it, right? But bro, they're here to celebrate.. right? What say, Bro-in-law? Shouldn't we shake our booty now? l often wish to fly away.. ..like a bird, free as day.. ..and bring back with the night.. ..a few grains and some light. 'Cos we are like this.. This is how we are! This is how we are!
