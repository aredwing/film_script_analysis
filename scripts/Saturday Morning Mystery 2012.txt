Is it yours? No. Hamlet. Hamlet, come on. (FIGURE GROWLING) (ALL GASPING) CHAD: Uh, guys? GWEN: (WHISPERING) Shh, Chad. (SCUTTLING) (FIGURE GROWLING) It's a projection. (BABY CRIES) What the shit? Can I help you? (WHINES) NANCY: There's no such thing as ghosts. Just cruddy old perverts, politicians, and real estate developers. When we first got together, we hunted ghosts. Sometimes aliens, moss monsters, the occasional scary robot. Now we know what we're really after is people... people with something to hide. People who want everyone to think there are ghosts. My best friend Gwen and I co-founded the gang our freshman year at Oberlin. She's a great partner in business, and an even better partner in fighting crime. Chad's our sound guy, and he also brings the van. He's the only one of us who actually believes in the paranormal, so he's probably great to have around in case we ever find something real. Before we found him, Floyd repaired robots at a haunted Showbiz Pizza in Seattle. Now he's the rocking-est resident gearhead a girl could ask for. Hamlet's his dog. Part Great Dane, part something else, and all affection. He's the muscle. And I'm Nancy, just a few months shy of getting my private detective's license, and already years into debunking shady shit. We rip off the masks so the authorities can slap on the cuffs. We're really good. We get to the bottom of things. Just ask these assholes... on visitors day... at the pen... in Huntsville. So, you think you busted up a kiddy-porn ring, huh? We're so glad you guys got here when you did. The situation here was, these guys had a cover story of a dead convict haunting the place. CHAD: Totally fake. We even bought high-8 and actually record the ghosts. CHAD: We can surrender those to you, if you want. NANCY: They were scaring everybody away from ever coming in, so that nobody was finding out what they were doing. Shut the fuck up! We've had this staked out for months. Fuckin' months. We have videotape of them bringing in the kids. CHAD: Officer, we have... We have wiretaps! We were building a case. You waltz in and fuck it all up. What do you think this is, some Saturday morning cartoon show? (WHINES) I don't watch television. We're just doing our jobs. We're paranormal investigators. Oh, so you're Ghostbusters. You know what happens to real detectives? They get killed! (WOMAN SCREAMING IN CRUISER) Listen, we got in there before anything happened to those kids, okay? Nothing happened to them because of us. Yeah, where were you guys? Whoa, you didn't do shit but taint evidence and fuck our investigation. These guys are gonna be out before happy hour, probably at the carnival, in line at the Zipper, if you know what I mean. (WOMAN SCREAMING) What, are you trying to get in touch with your inner child? Fuck your inner child. (SCREAMING) So I can call my parents again and get a loan for us at 15%, but we haven't paid off the last one yet. You still owe me money for one of those installments, by the way. Do you guys think that that was cow's blood in there? It was pig's blood, or something, you know? NANCY: This is just total crap. And who does that? And you... And you licked it. How were we supposed to know it was a sting operation, okay? I mean, what the hell? It's total crap, right? Right? It's total crap? CHAD: Yes, it's total crap. Yes. Yes. NANCY: It is total crap. Are we talking about the blood, or are we talking about... I think we're talking about the situation. No, we're talking about what happened today. Did you hear the way those cops were talking to us, like we were juveniles or something? Well... They weren't very nice. You save the kids from pedophiles, and you don't even get paid for it. How would you make that sustainable? Well, I was thinking that maybe we should refine our business model. CHAD: That's a good idea. Okay, I agree, but what do we do? I mean, how do we figure out a way to? Nance, you have to look on the bright side. CHAD: We'll figure it out. I can call my parents anytime. No. Remember that department store job? (CELL PHONE RINGS) I could work at the pool again. (RINGS) Hello? MAN: Oh, Nancy. This is Mike Ryan from Buford National Bank. Hi. Uh, calling about our haunted house. NANCY: Yes... It is potentially a paying job. By all means. All right, sir, I'm gonna work on this. You have pig blood all over you. CHAD: We don't know if it's pig blood. Ooh, you know what, I didn't tell you this, but... I don't have my period anymore. Oh, really? RYAN: That's great. Do you think you can do that for that price? Yeah, absolutely. Nancy, that would be really terrific, 'cause, you know, this ghost stuff, you would not believe. It's just... NANCY: We've seen some crazy stuff. Yeah, I mean, okay. Can I ask you one thing? Um, this place is... It's really bad, and, um, it's not like I believe in ghosts or anything like that, but you do have a... You do have a contingency plan, right, just in case... (RUSTLING NOISE) NANCY: Oh, no worries. I mean, we'll figure it out, whatever it is. Okay, great, 'cause, you know, you'd literally be saving my life. (OLD MAN COUGHING) Yeah. YOUNG WOMAN: Shut up. CHAD: Well, well. You guys want to be alone? Hello. What are you doin', buddy? What are you guys doing? Just hanging out. Creepy. Um, were you just hanging out with the busboy out there? Who's your new friend? So I was stuck in this place for four weeks. My face is peeling, I can't take a shit. Okay. But it's cool, 'cause I'm taking like 18 pills a day. Mm-hmm. 18 pills a day... Look, I'm sorry. Your card was declined. I tried it a couple times. It'd be like I'm on the tit, right? 'Cause it's for cash. CHAD: Okay. RYAN: That's great. Yes. That's great. I can't guarantee anything, but if you can put it to rest by the end of the weekend, I might be able to work out a little bonus for you, okay? NANCY: That would be fantastic. RYAN: Okay, okay, so tomorrow we'll see you. Tomorrow. 6:30, meet me at the house? NANCY: We can absolutely do that. Great. See you then. NANCY: Bye. RYAN: Bye. Did you have a good call? Do you think every place is your house? OLD MAN: Help me. GWEN: Those are like the kind of jobs that you're not supposed to take, and you always take those jobs. FLOYD: I need money, or you can't take a shit. But I couldn't... Okay! CHAD: So you hustled? You hustled, right? FLOYD: I hustled. Yeah? CHAD: Yeah? Oh! NANCY: Yeah! (LAUGHING) No, I'm not gonna work here no more, man. What are you worried about, Pedro? They're coming this weekend, man. They're gonna prove that there's no ghosts. Naw, Man. Exterminados fantasmos, man! I'm not working here anymore. This house is fucked up, bro. What? Come on. (BRANCH CREAKING) (OWL HOOTS) (BRANCH SNAPS) Hey! Pedro! Come on, man! Please! No more chupacabra, no more spirito, no more diablo. Pedro! Manuel? Javier. Shit! (INDISTINCT VOICE RASPING) All right. All right, you're gonna be that way. Be that way. (MUFFLED LAUGHTER COME ON OUT OF THERE. COME ON OUT OF THERE, MAN. (CACKLING) All right, show yourself, come on. (LAUGHTER) Whoa! All right, where are you? Come on out of there. All right, you gonna mess with me? Come on out where I can see you. Come on, I'm ready for ya. Let's go. Let's go! Come on, show your face! Come on! Aah! (ALT ROCK MUSIC) # Now maybe # I didn't mean to treat you bad # NANCY: All right. Old Kyser place, let's talk about it. Um, it was built in 1913. There's been a history of some reported Satanic activity going on over the years. Cult rituals, that sort of thing. GWEN: What kind of Satanists? Aleister Crowley or Anton Lavey? Uh, I don't think the bank's hip to that sort of thing, Gwen. Um, it sat vacant for a little while till the bank hired some maintenance crews and construction guys, but they keep getting scared away because of all the weird stuff that's going on. Did they order a full package or a half package? Full package, baby. Yeah. That's my little saleslady. (ENGINE REVVING) FLOYD: What's wrong, Chad? Are you scared? CHAD: No, I'm just... I'm having a little trouble with the accelerator. NANCY: Is that what that noise is? Did you touch the accelerator? No, I changed the oil and put, uh, antifreeze in it. I didn't ask you to change the antifreeze, because it's an air-cooled engine. I... Equipment, what do we got? Um, we got tapes, but we need a shitload of nine-volts though... It sorta... It smells weird. Chad, what are you doing? Yeah, well, we gotta pull over. There's something wrong with the car. Hold on, we gotta pull over. FLOYD: Where are we? Wait, we're stopping here? Ah, I hate this. Shit. I changed this. It's antifreeze. You, you put the oil in... It's antifreeze... You put oil in it. FLOYD: I don't drive your van, man. CHAD: This is any car. Any car is like this. FLOYD: No, man, I fix robots, not vans. CHAD: Robots have engines, don't they? FLOYD: No, they don't have antifreeze. (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) Are you sure you put it in here? No, I mean, I put it in front of this thing. Ah, Jesus. Are you on drugs, Floyd? Well, that doesn't look good. Looks like you might need some coolant or something. Yeah, we've definitely seen better days. Be happy to take a look. Officer, do you know how far it is to the Kyser place? Yeah, actually there's a pretty good Mexican place just up the road. Um, they have really good enchiladas. And there's a pretty nice little reasonable motel that's attached to it, so... Oh, no, again, we don't... We don't need a motel. We stay the night, it's what we do. GWEN: It's part of our job, so... It's like video surveillance throughout the nighttime. It's part of our deliverables. OFFICER LANCE: Oh, yeah, I guess they did mention something about that, yeah. I guess I thought... I thought they would send... maybe send someone with you, like a security guard. NANCY: Oh, well, that's not necessary. We don't need that. I mean, this is our job. It's what we do. GWEN: Yeah, we can take care of ourselves. But, I mean, do you have any sort of suggestions or information that you think we might need to know that... LANCE: I would suggest staying at the motel. Oh... Yeah, I really don't think they've told y'all enough about the place. So how long you been into this paranormal stuff? Oh, you know, just, like, since college. (GATE CREAKS) I bet you wanted to be a cop ever since you were a kid. Ah, I don't know. It's my job. GWEN: Wow. NANCY: Wow! I mean, it's amazing. It's all right. NANCY: This is beautiful. CHAD: This place is totally fuckin' haunted. CHAD: You think the water's okay to drink? Yeah. Yeah, it tastes fine. Maybe the guy from the bank is here already. LANCE: Yeah, I didn't see any other cars, so I think you guys might be on your own, actually. Oh, that's fine. That's not a problem. (SWITCH CLICKING) I have a little bit of time. I could show you around a little bit if you want. Yeah. Yeah, that would actually be great. I'm sure you'd be better at it than the guys from the bank anyway. Yeah, maybe. You know, it looks like the bank's actually done a pretty good job of cleaning it up, because they want to sell it. But they can't keep maintenance people around. Hence, a pile of sticks on the floor. CHAD: That's a pentagram. Yeah, that figures. Kids are always breaking in here with their Ouija boards, doing their little ceremonies, trying to scare each other. GWEN: Do you know what kind of occult practices they're using? Uh, sticks on the floor, I guess. Apparently, a place is empty long enough, they forget it's private property. NANCY: Do you know any actual history about the place that you could tell us? LANCE: It actually has a pretty interesting history. There are these people, the Kysers, buy the place back in the fifties after they come into a bunch of oil money, which they apparently took as some kind of sign from God or something. They have this big conversion, and they have some vision that this is holy ground or something, so they buy the place, put up a church. What kind of church? LANCE: It was, uh... It was Christian. Did have a little bit of Eastern religion mixed in there. It was actually pretty popular with people from the town for a while. And then it became unpopular. NANCY: Why is that? LANCE: Well, you know, some of the people from town got weirded out, I guess, by the whole Eastern religion thing. People started saying it was a cult. It was around that time that the county decided they wanted to take the land to build a mall. CHAD: That fireplace is off the charts. LANCE: They had a little school here that went with their church. Wasn't bad. Parents actually had me out here for a little while. You went to school here? LANCE: Yeah, I was in class with their daughter Mona. She wasn't a bad kid. But, uh, yeah, until my parents pulled me out. Oh, yeah? Why is that? LANCE: Well, supposedly the Kysers were pretty nasty drunks before their whole religious conversion. So I guess with the cult rumors and the, uh, land dispute, they, uh, got back on the sauce, and their kids started showing up places with weird marks on their faces, shit like that. So they liked to party, huh? You do the math. LANCE: Anyway, there's a really cool staircase over here. (CREAKING SOUND) Some really nice metalwork right here. Pretty ornate. FLOYD: Yeah, I was... I was thinking the same thing. It's pretty ornate. Solid oak banister, too, I believe. So whatever happened to the Kyser family? Uh, all that stuff with the land dispute and the cult stuff just kind of got more and more ugly, and, uh, next thing you know, people are saying that they're Satanists. They're trying to indoctrinate kids into Satanism, involving them in animal sacrifices. I never saw any animal sacrifices, but... Now, obviously, no mall. FLOYD: Who is this guy? LANCE: So people started saying the state should take custody of the kids, and, next thing you know, Mona and Frankie Kyser disappear. And, naturally, everyone starts saying that their parents sacrificed their kids to the Devil and burned them up in the incinerator. Police show up a few days later to investigate, nobody's here, and, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Kyser turn up in a motel room a few miles away, dead. Mrs. Kyser had her head bashed in with a TV, and Mr. Kyser had, uh, blown his brains out. (SQUEAK) Blah! Aah! God damn it, Floyd! Kids come in here and get all high on whatever, say they see ghosts, demons. (CAMERA CLICKS) Kid fell out this window and broke his neck. (WINDOW THUDS) CHAD: We gotta put a camera in this room. They found a leg over here. NANCY: Has anyone lived here since the Kysers? LANCE: Yeah, about 15 years ago, there was a couple that lived here. What happened to them? LANCE: They died. Multiple stab wounds to each other. In the kitchen is where we found them. Well, this place is fucked up. It's a pain in my ass, tell you that much. There's people say that the Kysers opened up a gate to Hell. I don't know about that, but if you guys find it, maybe you can charge admission. (VIBRATION) CHAD'S VOICE: Gate to Hell, gate to Hell. Gate to Hell, that's it! This place is evil. The Kysers were Satanists, so they they built their school on hallowed ground and indoctrinated the children into blood rituals so they could open a gate to Hell. MAN'S VOICE: They fear God. CHAD'S VOICE: Oh, my God. My God! They sacrificed their own children to appease the Prince of Darkness! They will possess the weak-minded. I must warn Floyd! I must not fear. Must not fear. I must not fear. Fear. Fear is the mind killer. (CREAKING) CHAD: Guys! LANCE: Yeah, so what'd you think so far? I think it's amazing. I'm really excited. Well, I know what you're gonna say next. That, you know... Oh. (CHUCKLES) You're professionals, and this is what you do... You got it. And you're fine, staying here all night, but I wouldn't mind stopping by when my shift is over, if that's okay. Yeah. It would make me feel better. This place is for real, guys. Why don't we put a camera on him? Can you not do that, please? (WHISPERS) Are they flirting? Nope. Are you jealous? No, I'm over that. Okay. I have my card here, if you need anything in the meantime. It does have my car phone number, as well as my office phone. Got it. So if you need anything at all, feel free to call either of those numbers. All right, I will. I'm sure we'll be fine. Okay, well... I'll see you later. All right, I'll see you later. Okay, bye. Bye. CHAD: Okay, before we go any further, can we just acknowledge that there's really something in this house that's real? There's something here, and we're gonna capture it. If we're gonna capture something, it's gonna happen tonight, okay? Yeah, listen, absolutely, I agree. Can you not do that? Hey, Floyd... You're a fucking child! Would you go find where to turn the electricity on, so we can get to work? Please? All right. Thank you. Goin' to work. Come on, Hamlet. See? Come on, Hambone. Our work's never done, man. Let's go. Huh. "Hey, Floyd, go turn on the power. "Hey, Floyd, fix the van. Hey, guys, go fuck yourself." Huh. Well, I don't see shit. Hey, check it out, Hambone. It's the Kyser family incinerator. Here, kiddy, kiddy. Well, there definitely was not a party in here. Well, this is creepy. (FAINT SINGING) What the fuck? (HAMLET WHINES) (WHINE) Huh. (THUD, BOARDS CREAKING) (DOOR CLOSES) Chad? GWEN: Hi. I'm gonna grab some things. CHAD: I'm telling you, babe, I felt something in that first room, the dining room, unlike any of the other places. GWEN: (SUGGESTIVELY) Did you feel it right here? CHAD: No, I didn't feel it back there. I'm telling you. I told you so... You sure? Maybe you felt it right, oh... (BREATHING RAPIDLY) Huh. (CLICKING FLASHLIGHT) (TAPPING FLASHLIGHT) Goddamn flashlight. (CLICKING) I can promise you this, Hambone. (GROWLING) We are not going in there. CHAD: Can we please not stay in the pentagram room? This looks exactly like the pentagram in the '52 incident in Manhattan Beach. You guys remember it? It wasn't facing north, just like this one. GWEN: This one's facing north. North-ish. FLOYD: It looks like a soccer ball made out of twigs. No, this is the top, right here. Floyd, did you put lights on my microphone? Yes, I did. I thought they'd match your sweater vest, Chadwick. Jeez. Thanks. (WIND MOANS) (STAIRS SQUEAKING) Blah! Aah! Shit. NANCY: No, Floyd, I need it more... It's fine. It's all the way open. I need it more to the right. It's fine. I really think it's important to get the bathroom over here. It's all the way open, and it's wide, Crimson, okay? Let it go. Oh, you know what? This is what I do. Please, really don't call me that. What do you want me to call you? Come on, we got more lights to set up. Aw! (LAUGHS) (STATIC) (CREAKING, VOICES) CHAD: Hello? Can you hear me? CHAD'S VOICE: Hello? Can you hear me? (TAPE REWINDING) CHAD'S VOICE: Can you hear me? (STOPS RECORDER) (SWITCHES ON DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE) (AMBIENT NOISE IN HEADPHONES) (DISTANT WOMAN'S VOICE) (WIND WHISTLING) (WOMAN'S VOICE) Is that you, Mona? Mona Kyser? May I speak to Mona or Frankie Kyser? (MUSIC) CHAD: Spirits of this house, please give me a sign. Spirits of this house, if you can hear me, knock two times. Chad? CHAD: Mona? (FEMALE VOICE) (PANTING) (WOMAN FAINTLY SINGING) Mona? Are you singing to me, Mona? (FAINT SINGING) Would you like to sing for me? My name is Chad. (FAINT SINGING) Mona? What? (WOMAN SINGING MORE CLEARLY) Sing to me again. (SINGING) (CHAD BREATHING HEAVILY) (SINGING STOPS, WIND WHISTLING) (FIGURE SHOUTS) Aah! CHAD: There's something that we don't understand that is going on in this house. This place is dangerous, okay? (OTHERS DISAGREEING) We need to get out of here. GWEN: Worry too much. Gwen, look, I... I can't stay here. I'm gonna go. You can stay here. I want you to stay here. Are you serious? I'm gonna take the van. What are you afraid of? I'll be back in the morning, I'm sorry. I just cannot do it. FLOYD: Hey, my shit's in that van. I'm gonna leave. Don't be a pussy. I'm sorry. Hey. Okay, hey, hey, hey. Yeah, what? Okay. All right, okay. Maybe there is something. I'm not... I'm not saying that there is, but what if there is? What if there is, and what if we find it and record it and can verify it? Floyd! What if we can do that? And that would be worth so much more. It's not about money. This is not about money right now. Okay, it's not about money. What is the one thing you told me you've wanted ever since you were a kid, huh? The one thing? Uh, antifreeze. He wants antifreeze for his vagina. That you wanted to see a ghost. And now, it's a possibility. Are you seriously telling me that you're willing to just give it up right now when you're so close? I mean... GWEN: Please stay. Okay. Remember when it used to be just me and you? I mean, it was us. Is this about me and Chad? Come on, Gwen. Or is it about Floyd? Because I warned you about him. Okay, well, I warned you about Chad. Yeah, but Chad and I are still together. Yeah, I am painfully aware of that. Guess we've gone a little Scooby-Doo. We used to be more like The Galloping Ghost. Mm-hmm. Two girls conquering the world's unsolved mysteries. (LAUGHS) I thought you never watched television. I don't. (VIDEO MONITORS BUZZING) (BUZZ) (BUZZING) (BUZZING) (DISTORTED VOICE, GROWLING) (HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Why don't you give me a treat? I fed Hamlet. (LAUGHS LIKE SCOOBY-DOO) He was hungry. Mmm, this tastes good. (SINISTER TONE) Why don't you give me a treat? Are you okay? (PANTING) I'm a good boy. Nancy's my favorite, but Floyd feeds me, 'cause I'm a good boy. I'm a good boy! Scratch me. Just behind my ear, it's my spot. Want to go chase a car? I like chasing cars. Fuck you! (BARKS) (GROWLING) (HAMLET WHINES) (BARKS) Don't fuckin' touch me. (LAUGHS) I'm cool, man. I'm cool, I'm cool. Don't you fuckin' touch me. I'm cool, man. Don't. (LAUGHS) I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool. (LAUGHS) I'm cool. I'm cool, man. Okay. Whoo, all right, I am feeling a little buzzy from that cig. Yeah, we never should have quit. No kidding. Help me up. CHAD: Fuck! Oh, my God, did... Oh, my God. Well, we have light. We have light. Give me that. Is Chad upstairs? I...don't think so. We did not turn on the lights. This guy is fuckin' possessed! Oh, come on. The lights came on somehow that had nothing to do with us! I'm not possessed It was a joke. I'm telling you, this place is fucking haunted, man! We came to a fuckin' haunted house! This is a real fucking haunted house! GWEN: Chad, chill out it's okay. I'm telling you, man, this is a fucking crazy place. NANCY: Floyd, did you turn the electricity on? FLOYD: No... Yeah, okay, look. It's just a joke. We're just gonna calm down, and we're gonna go upstairs. Someone turned the lights on, it wasn't us. We're gonna figure out who it was. Oh, God! Maybe it was a ghost. God! Wouldn't that be interesting, if it was a ghost? Come on. NANCY: I need you to tell me right now, are you fucking with him again? I need you to tell me. No. Don't be scared, Chad. Hey, Floyd, suck my fuckin' cock. He's just a scaredy-cat. Floyd, are you fucking with him? Yeah. You're fucking with him? Yeah, totally. Don't fuck with him. It's funny, though. (LAUGHING) But I didn't turn on the lights. (TICKING) (FEEDBACK) (MUFFLED CRASH) Did you hear that? GWEN: Nope. I heard something. That's the window the kids fell out of. Man. Sances are weird. You know, they get all these leaves from someplace. It's like, they just want to connect with something. That's the same paraphernalia from that '74 incident in Munich. These kids aren't fucking around. They bring in this stuff, and they sit there, and they actually chant. They actually call up something evil. No, they just want to connect with stuff. I love that you know about these things, and I also... I love that you can feel things, Chad, you know? Because I don't feel that stuff. I wish I did that. I don't do that. I'm always thinking, you know? I just want to feel things. And you don't think. You're not always thinking all the time, like me. You know, I'm always in my mind. I don't feel. I don't just like... feel things. You feel things. No, I don't. No, cold spots. Hot spots, right? See, you walk into a room in this house, and it's like somebody turned up the thermostat. (LAUGHS) You know, I start... I start sweating, and, uh, as I have these, like, heart palpitations or something. And it's just like, there's just something... There's... There's something really significant going on. You know, I just want to feel like I'm inside of this place. I just want to be close. I just want to love. Oh, I just want to be so close to it. I want to be like an insect, and all of my six legs are gonna gonna touch the whole inside of this house. (LIGHTS CLICK OFF) Uh... What... (BOTH MOANING) (DRIPPING) (WOMAN FAINTLY SINGING AND TALKING) (PLASTIC BAG RUSTLING) It's just kids. Ahem. FLOYD: There ain't shit going on. (FAINT MOANING SOUNDS) All right. Put some music on. (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GWEN WHISPERING) All the virgins in all the stories, all the virgins, they were sacrificed. (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) Pull it tighter. Look at me. (LAUGHING) GWEN: Whoo. (MUSIC CONTINUES) # I've got this feeling # You've got the tools (SONG CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (CREAKS, CRASHES) (WIND WHISTLING) (HOUSE SETTLING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (GWEN MOANING) (MUSIC PLAYING) That's a party. (MUSIC CONTINUES) Come on! Creepy shit! Creepy shit! (MUSIC PLAYING) Chad, you look like you're on fire. (FLAMES WHOOSH) FLOYD: Chad, you all right? (GASPS) FLOYD: There was a creep. Nance, what the fuck? FLOYD: Ah, fuck! What the fuck? Stupid fucking cunt! Hey, man, tell me there was a fuckin' ghost or demon who set my fuckin' van on fire! No, I was going up there to tell you guys there was something in the fucking room! Why the fuck did you do that? I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. You're completely right. It is all my fault, and I am a stupid fucking cunt. No, you can't talk to Nancy like that. You used my fucking equipment and my van to try and disprove something I believe in, so I'm the big fucking joke tonight! I'm gonna make it right! I'm gonna fix it! Good, you should! Okay! You guys need to calm down! GWEN: Look, it's not your fault. NANCY: Yes, it is my fault, and I'm really sorry. CHAD: You fucking try to disprove it every day! You are making a fucking joke of me! I'm a big fucking joke! Everyone thinks it's hilarious. Would you listen to me?! I'm gonna make it better! CHAD: No! Hey, guys? Hey, guys! Hey! (NANCY AND CHAD SHOUTING) Hey! You're not a joke! Hey! So when I was working on the van and you guys were chatting with the cop, I got rid of my stash. I threw my pipe in the cooler, and I put my bag of acid in this Thermos. NANCY: Fuck, Floyd. GWEN: I filled that with water. We're on acid, Floyd?! It's cool. It's okay! It's okay! It's low-grade stuff! It means we're tripping balls! Okay, okay, okay. We're just seeing shit! Look, look. That's all it means! This is good news! So what you're telling me is that the van could potentially not be on fire out there right now? No, I'm not saying that. The van's on fire. I'm saying you guys are tripping balls, and it's cool... No, no! Fucking asshole! FLOYD: Hey! Hey! No! CHAD: You have fucked me! FLOYD: You have fucking lost it, man! Don't fucking touch me! You need to calm down! You're a whore, okay? You guys just need to calm down. What? It's low-grade shit. You're a whore. I'm gonna fucking kill you before the night's over, man! No, you guys are tripping! Motherfucker, I will fucking kill you if you come near me again! All right. Fucking asshole. I'm out. What did you call me, Chad? I called you a whore. I'm gonna assume this is coming out of... you're upset? No, it's coming out of you being a whore. Don't you ever call me that again. I'm gonna go get our clothes now, and when I get back, I expect an apology. God damn you! (CHAD GROANS) Fuck! Fuck! (SHUDDERS) Nancy. Floyd. Look, fuck Chad. He's a dumb-ass. He doesn't know shit. Just go back inside, okay? I don't even know why you're coming out here. Look, I'm sorry about the van. I'm sorry about the van. I'm sorry about the acid. (LAUGHS) You're just fli... You're flipping out. You're just tripping. It's cool, calm down. Okay, I just don't know why you're out here. I just want you to go back inside, okay? I just want to be out here by myself. What are you doing? I'm standing here. I'm gonna sleep in the fucking fountain. (LAUGHS) You're not gonna sleep in the fountain. Yeah, I am. I'm gonna sleep in the fountain. All right, then I'm gonna stay with you. No, don't stay with me. I don't need you to stay with me, all right? I don't even know why you would want to. I'm fucking everything up. Everyone is here because of me. Everything is my fault. Look, I'm here because of you. Yeah. Don't. I know that sucks, but I'm here 'cause of you. It's okay. Will you calm down? It's gonna be fine. Just concentrate on my voice. Just calm down. (LAUGHING) See? Just have fun. Just have fun. It's okay. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure. Well, I predicted it, didn't I? Yeah. I mean, I didn't know. Like, it just seemed like... You didn't know? I told you this place was dangerous. I know. And now we're here, and we're stuck here. But you get that feeling a lot, Chad. Like, I can't believe that every single time you get a feeling. I made it a big deal. I made it clear. Yeah. So we're stuck. I know. Look, what are we doing here? I don't know, I mean, I think we're gonna try to... Gwen. We're gonna... What we're gonna do is we're gonna... walk. I mean, that's what we... We have each other. It's gonna be fine. We're gonna get the van fixed. This is bullshit, okay? I know. This is bullshit. What? What is this? What is... What is what? What we have. Chad, you're my boyfriend. You're my lover. I'm the money. You're my... Yeah, I can't do this. I don't know, you're doing pretty good. No, not this. This. I can't do this anymore. The group. I can't do it anymore. I quit. You quit? Yeah, I quit. What the fuck are you gonna do? I don't know, I'm gonna do something else. You can't do something else. Well, I know that, because I'm not good at anything. No, there's no such thing as ghosts, and you're really good at not finding them. Well, I want to be really good at finding something. Okay. You gotta take me with you. Floyd. Look, I know, I know, I know. I know, I know. Look, I don't care about any of this. I don't care about any of this. I only care about you. Aw. And Hamlet. I don't care about any of this stuff. I... I just... Just take me with you. I don't know, Floyd. Come on, no, no, no. Come on. I don't know. I don't know if we can do this again. No, I won't... I... Is that a car? Floyd, that's a car. Tell me you have a Slim Jim in that bag. I totally have a Slim Jim in this bag. CHAD: I cannot tell what's real anymore. I have just entered this home, where I actually felt something that I really wanted to feel, and I don't know if it was real or not. Look, I know I've just taken a tab of acid, and I've never done it before, but I don't know. Now we've gotten... Look where we've gotten with this. Chad... are you breaking up with me? I can't lose you, Chad, okay? You're like... You make me feel like a full person. I don't always feel that way. And I really... I didn't mean to cheat on you. I'm sorry. Look, this probably isn't the right forum for this. Chad, I love you. I love you. I'm just gonna lie down with this dog, because he loves me unconditionally, and he's beautiful, and he doesn't cheat on me, either. Mm, I love you, Hamlet. CHAD: Can you confirm that this dog is eating a human hand? (GWEN SCREAMS) (BOTH SHOUTING) You got it? CHAD: Floyd! What?! Over here! Where'd this come from? We found a hand. We found a human hand. You found a what? You're tripping balls, man. We got a car, though. Hamlet got it. Hamlet? We got a car. GWEN: It was in his mouth. I got this, though. I got this. Where did this come from? Hey, Hambone. GWEN: Whose car is this? CHAD: Can you get in? Floyd! Oh. We gotta get the fuck out of here, man! We have got to get the fuck out of here! Floyd, you gotta get that open! Hang on, hang on! (LOCK POPS) I got it! I got it, I got it, I got it! Oh, yeah, man! Open the back, please! You got a Slim Jim in that bag, and you don't have a knife. NANCY: We don't have a knife. Did anybody find the fucking keys? CHAD: Don't focus on the keys, focus on hotwiring the car. Yeah, I can hotwire the car, Chad. Mike Ryan. Mike Ryan. The guy from the bank. What, do you need, a fucking screwdriver? FLOYD: Where the fuck are the keys? NANCY: The guy from the bank. Where the fuck is he? Yeah, where is he? 'Cause we'd really like to use his car. Floyd, pop the trunk, please. Fuck! Oh, damn it. Okay, Floyd, pop the trunk, please. Pop the trunk, Floyd! I don't know where it is! Floyd, pop the trunk! Stop fucking yelling. (GASPS) FLOYD: You found pliers? NANCY: Yeah. Hey, guys... Hey, guys. Hey, guys, I think the banker's in the trunk. What? CHAD: I think the banker's in the trunk. Fuck you. (VOMITING) Oh, fuck, man.

Our records show a past due balance on your phone. No. But if you have a major credit card, I'd be happy to take that. Okay, I'm trying to reach 911. Um, I'm sorry, 911 doesn't appear to be the number you called. No. Okay, I'm aware of that. I'm just trying to reach the police. Mm-hmm. Then... then can you just... Then can you just patch me through to 911? I would really need some form of payment. Get his back pocket. (GWEN GROANS) (CHAD VOMITS) My records show that you are over $300 past due. I'm very sorry. Can you please just put me through to 911? I can take your information and try to get you at the front of the line. I cannot do that right now! It is an emergency! Just please, can you get me 911?! (GWEN SCREAMS) (GROWLING) (HAMLET BARKING) Th... There's... There's someone at the house! Guys, there's someone at the house! Motherfucker! Hey! Hamlet! Hamlet! They went upstairs! He's upstairs!

It's gotta be the two of us. Nancy, I think I solved the mystery. It's the Kysers. No, that's crazy. They're dead. No, they're not. They're dead. Mona and Frankie. It has to be the Kyser children. Remember how Officer Lance said that people from the county were always trying to take away the Kysers' house? NANCY: Right, so they could build a mall? GWEN: But what if that was the real reason people accused the Kysers of being Satanists? And maybe because the family couldn't take it anymore... NANCY: Gwen, that's why they killed themselves and their kids. GWEN: No, what if they didn't kill the kids? What if they actually ran away? NANCY: Right. And they must have been hiding here all along! And, somehow, they raised themselves, and... Gwen, they're just a couple of little kids trying to protect their home. GWEN: It's the only explanation that makes any sense. (DISTANT GROANING) Listen to me. They're upstairs, okay? I'm gonna lead, and I need you to follow behind and guard us with this, okay? Can you do that? Okay. (MAN AND WOMAN GRUNTING AND SHOUTING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Do I... (MAN SHOUTS) I... Do I... know you? (SPEAKS) Ow, what... (SPEAKS) Sss. Ow. Ow. (SPEAKS) Ow.

It is the kids from the house. We were in first grade together. LANCE: Right? Mona! Uh, we're not here to hurt you guys. We're just... We just want our friend back, okay? We actually... We know exactly who you are. You're Mona, and you're Frankie. And, um, we're not... We're not here to hurt you. We... We heard. We know what happened to you. We know that... that what happened to you is far worse than anything that your parents, your family was ever accused of. You're not Satanists. You're just... (GRUNTING) really messed up. And... that's not your fault. We just want to help you. And if you would just please put the ax down. Gwen, I need you to fucking shoot him! NANCY: Gwen! (GWEN SCREAMS) No! (GWEN SCREAMING) (FRANKIE MOANING) Enough! (GUNSHOT) (GWEN SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (GWEN GASPING) Please kill me. Please. Please, please. Please kill me. Please, please. (SCREAMING) You're my best friend. NANCY: Come on. LANCE: Right by the bridge, could lay down. Come on! We gotta go! I can take a nap. Nope. Up you go. (BOTH SCREAMING) (HOWLING) (GRUNTING) Lance.
