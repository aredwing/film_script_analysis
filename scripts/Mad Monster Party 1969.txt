BUT WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED A REPLY FROM... FROM... IT. WELL, I SHOULD HOPE THAT WE DON'T. YOU SEE, IT WASN'T INVITED. OH? IT WAS A CRUSHING BORE AT OUR LAST CONVENTION. IT KEPT WALKING AROUND CRUSHING BOARS, WILD BOARS, IN ITS HANDS. VERY FRANKLY, FRANCESCA, IT DISGUSTS EVEN ME. I SEE. DOCTOR, WE ALSO RECEIVED A VERY STRANGE LETTER... FROM SOMEONE WHO SAYS HE'S ARRIVING ON THE 13th. A FELIX... FLANKEN. HE'S COMING? OH, THAT IS GOOD NEWS! WHAT ELSE DOES HE WRITE? "LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING ALL THOSE FUN PEOPLE AT YOUR RESORT." RESORT? FUN PEOPLE? HE DOESN'T MEAN DRACULA AND THE WEREWOLF, SURELY! YES, YES, GO ON, GO ON. "CAN HARDLY WAIT TO DIP INTO THE POOL IN THE FRONT OF YOUR RESORT... AND LIE ON YOUR BEAUTIFUL BEACH." DOCTOR, DOES HE KNOW ABOU THE CROCODILES IN THE LAGOON... AND THE QUICKSAND ON THE BEACH? WHO, OR WHAT, IS THIS FLANKEN? OH, DON'T BE ALARMED, MY DEAR. FELIX FLANKEN IS A MERE HUMAN, AND HE'S UNAWARE OF THE NATURE OF OUR LITTLE GATHERING. BUT HE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE MY NEPHEW. YOUR NEPHEW? I THOUGHT YOU HAD NO... LIVING RELATIVES. FELIX IS THE CHILD OF MY YOUNGEST SISTER. SHE TURNED OUT TO BE THE WHITE SHEEP OF THE FAMILY. OH, TOO BAD. SHE HAD A GREAT FLARE FOR WITCHCRAFT. BUT THEN SHE ME THIS TRAVELING MEDICINE MAN, CHUCK FLANKEN, IN TRANSYLVANIA, AND SHE ELOPED WITH HIM AND WEN TO THE UNITED STATES TO LIVE. THEY'RE BOTH GONE NOW, BUT THEIR SON, FELIX, IS MY ONLY RELATIVE AND HEIR. BUT WHY ARE YOU INVITING HIM TO THIS CONVENTION? BECAUSE, MY DEAR, I'M- I'M RETIRING. YES. OH, DON'T LOOK SO UNBELIEVING. I'VE GROWN A LITTLE TIRED OF THIS HORROR BUSINESS, DOING BAD FOR OTHERS AND VERY RARELY GETTING ANY BAD IN RETURN. BUT NOW THAT I'VE MASTERED MY GREATEST DISCOVERY, I'D LIKE TO RETIRE WHILE I'M ON TOP. I SHALL TURN OVER ALL MY SECRETS TO FELIX, INCLUDING MY LAST GREAT ONE, AND THEN PRESENT HIM TO THE CONVENTION AS MY SUCCESSOR. [ Clock Chiming ] AAAH! [ Chimes ] AAAH!

WAIT A MINUTE, COUNT! POINT OF ORDER! POINT OF INFORMATION! POINT OF IMPORTANCE! SPEAK UP AND STOP POINTING. I CANNOT ALLOW US TO DO THIS TO BARON VON FRANKENSTEIN. WE MUST REMAIN LOYAL TO HIM. HE WAS ALWAYS AROUND WHEN WE NEEDED HIM. NOW, WHEN HE NEEDS US- HE WAS AROUND WHEN YOU NEEDED HIM? WHEN YOU NEEDED A GIRLFRIEND, AND HE JUST MADE ONE, DID HE GIVE IT TO YOU? WELL, NO, BUT- AND WHAT ABOUT FRANCESCA? HE COULD HAVE GIVEN HER TO YOU, BUT DID HE? [ Mutters ] NO, HE KEPT HER FOR HIMSELF- HIMSELF, YETCH- WHEN WE ALL KNEW SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOURS.

PUT HER DOWN! IT'S ME YOU WANT. COME ON, FRANCESCA! COME ON! WHERE ARE YOU? FRANCESCA! YOU CALLED? QUICK, FELIX. START THE ENGINE. WE'VE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM HERE. B- BUT MY UNCLE- WHAT OF HIM? IT'S TOO LATE. NO ONE CAN HELP HIM NOW. QUICKLY, DARLING, MY BELOVED, MY SWEET, BUG OUT! YES, ALL RIGHT. AND NOW YOU, YOU OVERGROWN CHIMPANZEE. YOU'VE CAUSED ME ANGUISH FOR THE VERY LAST TIME. AND ALL OF YOU, WITH YOUR JEALOUSIES AND YOUR HATES. YOU WANTED MY VIAL. YOU'D KILL MY NEPHEW FOR IT. WELL, NOW YOU SHALL SEE THAT BARON VON FRANKENSTEIN... IS NOT ONE TO CROSS. TRUE, YOU WON'T SEE I FOR TOO LONG A TIME. BUT FOR ONE SECOND - [ Chuckles ] OH, BOY! I KNOW IT'S WRONG, BUT I HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS URGE TO SING "AULD LANG SYNE." DID YOU CLOSE THE WINDOWS IN YOUR ROOM? WELL, IT'S ALL OVER, MY DARLING. WE'RE GOING HOME NOW. MY PLACE ISN'T MUCH- TWO SMALL ROOMS, A FURNISHED MEDICINE CABINET. BUT WE'LL BE MARRIED. AND SOON THERE'LL BE THE SOUND OF TINY FLANKENS RUNNING AROUND. OH, FELIX! [ Sobs ] WH-WH-WHAT IS IT? WHAT HAVE I SAID? WE'LL GET A BIGGER PLACE. I'LL GIVE UP SNEEZING. WHAT IS IT? OH, FELIX, I CAN NEVER MARRY YOU. YOU CAN'T? YOU DON'T LOVE ME? YES, I DO. I DO LOVE YOU, AND THAT'S WHY I WON'T MARRY YOU. WELL, FRANCESCA, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. I CAN'T KEEP ON DATING YOU IN JUNGLES. NO, FELIX. THERE'S SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU. HAVEN'T YOU WONDERED WHY I WAS ON THAT ISLAND? YOU SEE, I'M NO A HUMAN BEING LIKE YOU ARE. I WAS CREATED BY FRANKENSTEIN AFTER THE MONSTER AND HIS MATE. I WAS HIS MASTERPIECE. BUT WHERE OTHER WOMEN HAVE A HEART, I HAVE A SPRING THAT WILL UNWIND. WHERE OTHER WOMEN HAVE LUNGS, I'VE GOT A PUMP THAT RUNS ON BATTERIES WHICH WILL RUN OUT. WHERE OTHER WOMEN HAVE ELBOWS AND KNEES, I HAVE METALLIC JOINTS THAT WILL ONE DAY GROW RUSTY AND STIFFEN. I'M JUST A MACHINE WITH HUNDREDS OF PARTS THAT WILL EVENTUALLY WEAR OUT.
