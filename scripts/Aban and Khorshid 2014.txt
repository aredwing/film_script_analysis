What do you want me to say? Tell me your name. Hi Aban. I bid you hello. My name is Aban. I'm tired. I can't stay awake anymore. Why? I'm having dreams. What dreams? They took you from me. I can't tell what is a dream, and what isn't anymore. When I'm asleep, it's as if I'm awake... ... and when I'm awake, it's as I'm asleep. Sing a song for me. I don't know how. Everyone can sing. Altough I am of beautiful nature, With the cypress's stature, the tulips glow, I cannot fathom, here in this earthly joy, Why my creator painted me so. Here. Isn't it nice. Do you remember how we met? I'm trying to remember. You already know. I want you to tell me. It was Chahar Shanbe Soori. I was lighting up the fire with everyone. And all of a sudden, you showed up out of nowhere. If you could, just for a day... Have a... Have a super power? What would it be? I would want to be... I would want to fly. But we don't have wings. Do you still think I'm beautiful? Yes. Just like Dracula... Dracula with cucumbers. Don't play with your food. What about now? Am I beautiful? I'm so hungry. You're always so hungry. Hey Mister! We're ready to order. Two sweet teas. Doo Randi, bread, cheese... What else? Oh, halva for the young gentleman. I hope it's no trouble. Aban. What is it, Khorshid, my dear? He's bringing your order for you right now. What's it like on the other side? Nothing. No one will bother us, Aban. You never get full, do you? Aban. Yes? Are you hungry? Yes. You got tired from eating that much, didn't you? Yeah... I'm sleepy. Should we go take a nap? Yes. You eat and then you sleep. That's my life. It's our lives! - Don't move! Don't move! Did you open it? Yes. Aban. Look at it from up close. Do you see the dot in the middle? What is it? That's us. Don't be afraid. Aban? Khorshid. Yes, my love? That super power you talked about... Now I know what it is. What is it? What you said... To fly. Take off my blindfold! Aban. Please take it off. Sir, please take off my blindfold! Take off my blindfold! I want to see you Khorshid! Aban. Yes? Grab my wing. by BatissForever apr 2016
