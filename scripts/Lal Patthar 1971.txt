That is why I keep getting drawn here... ...and still don't feel satiated. I am very tired, sister-in-law, serve me tea. - Go, get the stuff from the car. - Me? Lmpossible! I cannot walk any more, Leela, you go and get it. Don't you feel ashamed? Lmpossible indeed! Who asked you to insist that we see everything in a day? And now? 'I am tired, I cannot walk anymore'! Shameless! What! Did you hear that, sister-in-law? Why do you pay attention to that nut? - Where are you going? - To get the food. - I'll go... - Wait. I'll go. Don't touch it! Brother! - Isn't that Leela's voice? - Yes. Don't be afraid, dear. I was forbidding you... ...so that your hands don't touch blood. - Blood? - Yes, blood. - What nonsense are you talking? I am not talking nonsense, I am speaking the truth. There is a tale of blood in every stone here. Tale of blood... in every stone. - You'd come to see Fatehpur Sikri? - Yes. - Have you finished going around? - Yes. Did you see 'Lal Pathar' (red stone)? - Lal Pathar? - Yes, Lal Pathar. All the stones here are red. No, I am not talking about all the stones. I am talking about only those two stones which are red as blood. Did you see those two stones? But the guide book doesn't mention any such... Does the guide book mention how many conspiracies... ...how many murders, were committed here? How many lovers met here and parted ways? Does it mention the story of Negro Suleiman? Does it mention Kurshid and Mubarrak's woeful story? No, it doesn't. Likewise, even those two red stones are not mentioned. But does that make it a lie? Will that make it a lie? - Shall I ask you something? - What? - Who are you? - Why do you ask? No reason. Just like that. - Introduce yourself. - Introduce? I tried hard to forget. Very hard. But where am I able to forget? I'm not able to forget. - Can you give me some water? - Sure. Here. Blood! Blood! - What is in this? - Tea. He speaks Hindi and English very fluently. Could he be some bandit? Shh! He may hear you. Will you hear the historic story of that red stone? Even we want to hear. Please tell us. - Yes, please tell us. - But it's getting late. Sir, everyone sees the Taj Mahal by moonlight. But if you don't see Fatehpur Sikri by moonlight... ...you have seen nothing in Agra. You are right. It's a full moon night. And then, we have a car. Please tell us. Sure. Rainagar's history was strange. The first man of the royal family of Rainagar... ...King Raghav Shanker Rai... ...was a cruel and brutal bandit. Break open the door! Wow! You all go to the other room. Sonmai, I was looking for you. You cannot escape me today. When Gyanshanker, the only male heir... ...of the 7th generation of the Rai family... ...was eight years old... - Hey! Who are you? - Kokha. Anand's son? ...Who am I? - Grandfather. - Yes! Don't ever go there, you'll get the curse of Queen Sonmai. I have sent an appeal to the Emperor abroad... ...that Anand has imprisoned me. Don't tell anyone. Son, when you grow up, get an education. And be good to your subjects. Mom, why has father imprisoned grandfather? No, dear. - Because he has gone mad? - Yes. - Why does one go mad? - It's a kind of sickness. Mom, why had Queen Sonmai cursed us? - Who told you? - Haricharan, & even grandfather. You will understand when you grow up. Now go to sleep. - Tell me! - Go to sleep, Kokha. I'll go and serve dinner to your father. Leave me! Come here. Let her go, father! Hurry! Run! After this incident, Gyanshanker's mother... ...sent him to his uncle in Allahabad. The uncle was a bachelor... ...and a professor of psychology in the university. Gyanshanker grew up there... ...and became a double graduate in Psychology and History. The father, a cruel man, and the mother, an angel. Gyanshanker grew up with the blood of... ...two opposite personalities running in his veins. Sit down. Raja Bahadur of Kanchanpur has sent a message... ...that he cannot wait any longer. Why? He says the princess has grown up. Anything else? The Governor is coming to Barrackpur this month. - He wants to meet you. - I will meet him. And also present him a cheque... ...of Rs.100000 for the government hospital. And also recommended the title of Raja Bahadur (king)... ...for yourself on new year eve. But Kumar (prince), until you don't marry... I won't get the title of Raja Bahadur. Divan uncle, you are aware that I won't marry. Write to the Raja of Kanchanpur... ...to get his daughter married elsewhere. Where the title is concerned... ...I'll remain Kumar Bahadur in this birth. You are aware of the curse of Queen Sonmai. I don't want the lineage of this mad family to continue. Sir, some men have come from Sultanpur. They say the lion has attacked again. Welcome, Kumar Bahadur! - Hello. - Hello. We are in the jungle since 5 days... ...and you want to kill the lion in a day? That's what I intend, and then, I have your support. That's true! Come, first enjoy our welcome. Give us an opportunity to serve you. - Please sit down. - Please be seated. What would you like to drink? I don't drink. What kind of a joke is this? Everyone here takes your family name before opening a bottle. You should have more liquor running in your veins than blood. So don't be formal. Gulabjan, he is the Prince of Rainagar, Gyanshanker Rai. Salute him. Is this what you have been hunting since 5 days? You are right. Watch the deer being hunted... ...before hunting for the lion. Come! I'll show you an evening in heaven Come and rest among tresses Come! Even flowers cannot match the colour of my body I'm a rose that has made this party fragrant My style, my anklets, my alluring songs Everything about me is incomparable Meet my eyes, get intoxicated So come! You have come into this world for a short while, so enjoy Who knows what tomorrow will bring Life cannot be trusted, I swear These joys may not exist for you tomorrow We'll face whatever the consequences So come! Wow! That was fun. What do you say Kumar Bahadur? Kumar Bahadur has left. Neither did he drink, nor look at that girl. - He's eccentric. - Call him crazy. Chhotu, don't ever get married. Yes. But my mom says I must. Lair! You yourself want to get married. No master, I swear. But mom doesn't agree. - Have you seen a girl? - Mom has. You yourself are so young, how old is the girl? - Five years. - Five years? - You are a criminal. - Yes. You should be shot dead. Yes... what?! Master, here. Shoot me dead. - We are ready, sir. - Arranged the beaters? - Everything has been arranged. - And those other hunters? I checked on them. After the late night, they are still sleeping. A palanquin in such a thick jungle? Hira, you go and call out from there, I am going here. Walk faster. - Stop! Who is that? - Your father! Open the door. - Who is that? - It's Chhotu calling. Call him. - Chhotu, master is here. - I'm coming. I heard the gunshots and came running, master. She seems to be unconscious. Splash some water on her. Hira Singh, look for the palanquin bearers. Palanquin bearers, if you care for your lives, present yourselves. Or I will shoot you dead. Don't shoot! We are hiding here. - Come out! - We don't know anything, sir. Come and stand here! Raise your hands. Move! - Stop! - Who are you people? We are palanquin bearers. - Where do you live? - Rahimpur bazaar, sir. - Who is this girl? - We don't know anything, sir. Bandits forced us to carry the palanquin. - So they were bandits? - Yes, sir. Hira, go and make enquiries in Rahimpur bazaar. Put your hands your down. ...Carry the palanquin. - I made enquiries, sir. - Tell me. Village Rampur had been looted. The bandits looted lots of money & jewelry from 3-4 houses. And picked up the farmer, Gokul's widowed wife. - Anyone else in that family? - Gokul's mother & younger brother. - Ask the brother to come here. - He'll be here by evening. So what the palanquin bearers said was true. Yes. Alright, you go and take rest. - Hira Singh. - Yes, sir? Escort this woman back home tomorrow. Put the palanquin down. Where are you going? Sister-in-law is going inside the house, mother. Inside the house? Sister-in-law, indeed! Look, if you want to live, go and live in the cowshed. You lost your honour and are returning home after so many days. What did you expect? A warm welcome? She is untouched and safe. The bandits got scared, left her and ran away. Shut-up! My son is dead, or we'd know how untouched she is. The unchaste woman! Mother, there is no reason to doubt. She is untouched, master said so. You believe Kumar Bahadur's word? He is King Anand Shanker's son! And you know the family reputation. You seem to know everything. Had the king summoned you too in his palace? You shameless fellow! How dare you! - Who is this bearded man? - Ask me. I am Kumar Bahadur's attendant. Master has said you have to keep her home in comfort. Get lost! Who is he to order me? - What did you say? - Don't get annoyed, sir. Everything will be alright. Good day. Sister-in-law, go inside the house. Tell master everything is alright. Then the old mother-in-law saw Hira Singh's gun and got scared. Then we left. - And Gokul's wife? - She was crying. Chhotu, ask Khan to come and see me. - Get whiskey. - What, master? Tell Haricharan to get whiskey. Hari uncle... What do you want at this hour, Chhotu? Master has asked for whiskey. - What did you say? - Master has asked for whiskey. Have you started drinking at such a young age? Has Kumar Bahadur ever touched liquor? Shameless fellow! Liar! Go and do your work. I am not lying, and I am not drunk either. I asked twice. Master asked me to tell you to bring him whiskey. I am going to call Mr. Khan. Take it to my room. Her thoughts came... ...and just wouldn't stop They went on making me go crazy Every breath I take, is someone's memory It went on making me more and more restless Her thoughts... Mr. Khan, you continue. My heart reverberates... ...a lover's voice My heart was lonely, she filled it with love Her thoughts... My senses... ...were electrified She intoxicated me with her mischievous eyes and left Her thoughts... You impudent witch! Had your father sent this rice that you are thrown it away? Look what she is saying! You will have to eat this! I'll skin you alive! How dare you argue with mother! Break her bones. Beat her more. You want to kill me? Then kill me! Help! Bandits have entered the village! Bandits have entered the village! Come quickly! Over there. Where are you running away? My son! She is more shocked than hurt. I have given her an injection... ...but a constant watch needs to be kept on her. If there is any complication, call me. I will send the medicines across. Good day. Mother. Her mother-in-law and brother-in-law were very greedy. They took money and left the village. - Are you speaking the truth? - I heard it myself. They took Rs.2000 and left the village. That was good. Her mother-in-law was a bitch. But why were they paid so much money? Rs.2000 is not a big amount for master. Kumar Bahadur is leaving for Barrackpur this month. He is taking me along. What about this woman? Diwanji was saying she'll be sent to Kashi when she gets better. I'll get you married to Myna & leave with her on the pilgrimage. No, master said that if I marry such a young girl, he'll kill me. I don't want to marry. Send me away to Kashi? No. You give me goblets of wine And fill my heart with bliss Who will give me this bliss in the other world Here, I have wine, I have you Who knows what is over there Angel! Such a beautiful angel. Do you know, mother had made that jewelry for my wife. But no one is going to come in this mansion... ...who will wear them and do justice to our prestige. I will never get married. Come. Yet, you have full right over this jewelry. From now on, I'll call you Madhuri. Madhuri, the one who charms the heart. Yes Madhuri, I will make you the way I want you to be. Saudamini is dead forever. And Madhuri begins a new life. 'Here, my beloved, I have you, I have wine' 'There, who knows... ' Madhuri, wait. What kind of behavior is this? Why did you come away from there? I had bathed, prayed, and you brought me to a grave. This is not a grave. It is the dargah of Salim Chisti. He was a great saint. What have I got to do that? I cannot defile my religion for your sake. I'll have to go home and take a bath again. Madhuri, wait! - Such a huge mansion! - It is not a mansion. It is Sikandara, Emperor Akbar's tomb. A grave here too? Why have you brought me to a city of graves? Take me back to Vrindavan. I'll bathe in the pond there and be purified again. - What are you doing? - I was thinking. - With closed eyes? - Yes. - Lair! You are lying. - Yes... no! I say, you were sleeping, not thinking. I really was thinking, madam. If you have to think, think with your head, not your nose. Lair! Got caught! What are you doing here? Don't you have any work? I had come to tell Shibu to grind almonds. So what are you doing here? I came to tell Mishraji that master wants his dinner on time. Mishraji, hurry up, it's time for Kumar Bahadur to arrive. You do the chores so slowly. I am almost through, madam. Where is my box of 'paan'? I'll give it to you. Coming! You're back. What have you bought for me? - Saree blouse? - Open and see what it contains. What lovely pictures! Where did you get these books from? Elephant, cat, horse, monkey. - Like it? - Very much. You will have to read all those books. Yes! What is this? Come on. - It's 'A'. - It's your head. This is not 'A', it's 'D'. This is 'A'. Not English, teach me Hindi. Come on, now you read. You don't love me. I love you very much, Madhuri. - 'O' for owl. - 'O' for owl. The owl speaks. - 'R' for rabbit. - 'R' for rabbit. - The rabbit runs. - The rabbit runs. - 'F' for food. - 'F' for food. - The food is cooked. - The food is cooked. The food must be ready. - I'll go and check. - Sit down and study. It's tame for your dinner and I am still sitting here. - Not tame, time. - But Chhotu says tame. Chhotu is a servant, illiterate. You are the lady of the house. Alright, time. Let me go, it is so late, and I'm hungry too. - What? - Read again. - Read? - Yes, read again. When your pronunciation is wrong, what will you teach me? Alright. That is what I said. No madam, read like I do. Not sily, sly. - What is God? - God means, Bhugwan. Bhugwan? No, it's Bhagwan. Alright, Bhugwan. God, I'm scared! Rohini is no good. I don't like her. - Who? - Rohini. The lady of Kishankant's Bill. It's not Kishankant, it's Krishnakant. And not Bill, it's Will. Alright. And that Gobindlal has left his wife, Bhimar... ...and got involved with that witch. It's not Gobindlal, it's Govindlal. And it's not Bhimar, it's Bhramar. Alright, but atleast let me finish. And even that bitch met the same fate. Gobindlal killed her. She deserved it, the bitch! What happened? Where are you going? Not like that, sing like this. I cannot sing. I cannot learn to sing. Then what can you do? Sleep and munch 'paan' all day like a cow? - You are angry. - No, I am not angry. Come, I'll sit with you. Enough! Stop it! - Who is it? - It's me master, Chhotu. I just came. Go and greet him. Go. Don't feel shy, master is like our father. Greet him. - Who is she? - She's Myna. - Myna? - My wife. But you said she is five years old. That was ten years ago. She was five years old, ten years ago. Ten years. Ten years! Ten years. Ten... years. Ten years... Ten years! ...Ten years! On the melody of lonely breaths On the wet strings of tears Life is hearing a song Life is singing a song What is called love Is a game, is a toy You get it today, you lose it tomorrow On lonely... On the melody of lonely breaths On the wet strings of tears Life is joining in a note Life is forgetting a note On the melody... Some buds sing Some buds cry Some tears are just water, some tears are pearls On the melody of lonely breaths On the wet strings of tears Life is making someone laugh Life is making someone cry - What's there to laugh in this? - What else can I do? You should have atleast seen your face. What's wrong with my face? Your hair is greying. Have you noticed? I know. But why this sudden desire to get married? And just the desire won't help you get married. Who will give you a girl? And which girl will agree to marry you? Is that so? But you don't have any objection, do you? Not at all. But tell me something. Why did you suddenly think of getting married at this age? Who doesn't want a normal life? Besides, I also have some duty towards my family. I gathered information, master. The girl's name is Sumita. - Who is in her family. - A mother and father. Mother and father. It's morning and Sumita hasn't returned from the function yet. God knows what this girl is up to. Listen. Get up and make me a cup of tea. My temperature hasn't subsided yet. - Not yet? - No. You are sick all How do I go out without having tea? We are out of tea leaves. - No tea leaves? - Yes. Why are there no tea leaves? You squander away my money. Squander money? As if you make millions. Whatever little you make, you blow away on liquor and races. I'll spend as I wish! Do you know, last week's reward has got carried over this week. You understand? You will, only if you have brains. This week, the reward will be Rs.60000. And when I bring that Rs.60000 home... ...it will surprise you. That's what I have been hearing all my life. How can I be lucky when I have a wife like you? Damn! You ruined my morning. And don't you dare spend a penny from the money Sumita brings. Or we'll have a war at home. You're back. Where were you for so long? The function went on until late, so I stayed over at Ratna's. You did the right thing. Give me the money. Here's Rs.50. But they promised to pay Rs.100. So why Rs.50 only? They said they will give the balance later. They said they will pay later? Trying to fool me? Here's Rs.10. Buy a packet of tea leaves. And buy vegetables and anything else you want to. I will not come for lunch. And tell those people if they don't pay the balance money... ...I sue them. Move! Listen... I am calling you. - Me? - Yes. Me? Mr. Aga, don't you sleep at night? - You want interest early in the morning? - What? I mean that I owe you interest amount of Rs.12.50. I can pay you the interest. But last week's reward of Rs.25000... ...got carried forward this week, and has become Rs.60000. Today is Saturday. I will play today and return your every penny tomorrow. But this is not done. I am going to play the races... ...and you have come to collect your money early morning. What are you talking about? I don't understand. - I am not Aga. - You are not Aga? No, my name is Hira Singh. Are you Sumita's father? Why didn't you tell me before? No, actually, I am... - Then let's go. - Where? My master has sent his greetings. I don't know your master. Why has he sent me greetings? My master is Kumar Bahadur Gyanshanker Rai of Rainagar. Alright, let's go. No, wait. Does your master play races? Then ask him to bet on Star of Italy. I'm giving him a tip. He doesn't want any tips. He has urgent work with you. Urgent work? Here mother, take your medicine. This sickness is going to take my life. Don't talk like that. I am only worried about your marriage now. Then I'll die peacefully. Don't worry, mother. What is destined will happen. - Here's Rs.50. - How did you save so much? I told father I'll get Rs.50 later. What if he comes to know? We'll deal with it then. - How are you feeling now, Manju? - Come, sister. - The temperature is still high. - I've sent for the doctor. Vishnu is bringing milk and porridge for you. What has Shekhar written? London, dated 22nd. Aunt, greetings. - Is it Shekhar's letter? - Yes, mother. That is why I came. And she snatched the letter from me. He sends you his greetings, mother. God bless him. When is he coming? He's written he'll go to buy his ticket after posting this letter. Alright, leave us alone, I want to talk to your mother. Shekhar is coming in a few days. So I thought I'll discuss this with you. Tell me. I want to make Sumita my daughter-in-law. - What do you think? - Sumita likes you since childhood. Even now, she is all yours. You will get the balance money on the day of the marriage. Alright. No one should know the date of the marriage. It is the 14th today. All arrangements within seven days... That's my responsibility, you don't worry about it. You won't have to spend a single penny. A house will be taken in Balliganj... ...and the marriage will be conducted there. And yes, your daughter will not come to meet you very often... ...after marriage. Okay. I have heard you are fond of races. What are you saying! I am a poor man. I survive on my pension and some rent I get. How can I play races? But if you... Hira Singh, drop him home. - Good day. - Come, sir. This marriage will never take place! - It will! - I won't allow it! Shut-up! Do you know how much money he has given me? I will never sell my daughter for money. Shut-up! Don't give me that big talk. I am the master of the house. I will decide! Master indeed! I lost all my children. You could neither feed them, nor afford their treatment. We just have one daughter left. You cannot feed even her. She did her 12th grade with great difficulty. She could not continue with her education. Thanks to Shekhar that she learnt to sing. She sings and makes a living. You blow away her money too in liquor and races. You have even mortgaged the house, & then you act high handed? Don't you feel ashamed? - Why should I feel ashamed? - Mother! Mother, be quiet. I will not stay quiet. I have kept quiet all my life. Shut-up, woman! I have mortgaged my house. Why do you complain? Enough now, don't shout. You bitch! Shut-up, you lowly man. I will never allow my daughter's marriage with an old man. You called me a lowly man? Yes, you are a lowly man! A drunkard, gambler, selfish fiend! What did you say! My bottle also broke. Where will I get scotch now at this hour? Father, don't go, I'll get married. I will get married, father. Nice doll. You really have brought home a beautiful doll. I have married her. Yes, you had brought home a doll ten years ago too. But you didn't marry her. And didn't keep her in your mother's mansion either. Tell me, is she more beautiful than me? I did not marry her for her looks. Oh, you saw her qualities. That's true. She is educated, and can even sing. I don't have any qualities. - But... - But what? Let me see how long this game will last with that doll. Madhuri! Sumita is my wife. So... So you will have to spend your nuptial night with her. - But... - But what? - I was thinking... - What were you thinking? About the huge age difference between you two. Just think about it. - Sumita, are you sad? - About what? About your marriage with me? - Why do you say that? - Because... ...I am too old for you. I never thought about that. Sumita, this is my mother's mansion. After her death, this mansion had been shut. The mansion was opened for you after so many years. You have done your - Yes. - Why didn't you continue? You are aware of our financial state. - Want to study further? - If you wish so. Sumita, will you sing for me? If you want to hear me sing, I surely will. Then come. Bedeck my bed with flowers today I will be born again today The dot is made of moon, my bangles are made of stars My necklace made of dreams My breaths is fragrant with saffron My body desirous Adorn me so, my friend That my husband loses control Bedeck my bed... Don't cry, mother. I am telling you the truth, I am very happy. Don't console me, I know everything. You don't know. Do you know what a huge mansion he has? Tall pillars, big rooms, servants, property! Do you know what his yearly income is? Rs.10,00000! If it was you, you would have got lost in that mansion. I don't get out of my room out of fear. Diwan uncle was saying that now since he is married... ...Kumar Bahadur will be bestowed the title of Raja Bahadur(king). And I'll be Rani Maa (queen mother). I'll become the Queen of Rainagar! Shekhar has returned from abroad. So he is back? After three years instead of two. As a qualified engineer with a degree. - Won't you go to meet him? - I surely will. I will hear about him and tell him about my good fortune. - I must go. - Then go right now. Yes. - Going out? - I'm going to meet Shekhar. - But... - If you don't... No, I just wanted to say that don't be too long. Return soon. Because Kumar Bahadur can come any time. He said he will come in the evening, but... I'll be back soon, father. Alright. - Shekhar... - Go back home, Sumita. Did you meet mother after you returned? I didn't think it necessary. If you had, perhaps you wouldn't have torn my pictures like this. What do you mean? There was liquor in the bottle, so the wound has healed. What are you talking? Liquor in the bottle? What are you talking about? The scar on mother's head will never fade. - Don't blabber like mad. - I wish I was mad. Atleast my mother wouldn't have got beaten then. Who hit her? Your father? With a bottle of liquor? Forgive me, Sumita. I never expected him to stoop so low. - Sumita. - Aunt! Don't cry. Sit here, I'll get something for you. Shekhar, my mother is very unhappy, and alone. Please take care of her. Sure I will. You don't worry about her. Look Sumita, no one can change destiny. Now your only goal should be to keep your husband happy. You bless me. I bless that you live a happy married life. But I cannot understand him. It takes time to understand any man. Shekhar is a very nice boy. They are childhood friends. Shekhar's aunt used to carry Sumita in her arms all day. It is Shekhar who encouraged Sumita to study and sing. I just left her there and came back. Shekhar has returned from Germany as an engineer after many years. I was there with here. Now that you are waiting for her... ...I'll go and call her. - I'll come with you. - What was his name you said? - Shekhar. He's a very nice boy. - Where does he live? - Close by. We'll walk it out. Go Vishnu, get tea. Have some snacks, Sumita. Sumita, come soon, Kumar Bahadur has come. He has? But he said he will come in the evening. Can't trust these rich men. He came just now. Shekhar, you also come. He is sitting in the hall. Come. Shekhar, he is my son-in-law, Kumar Gyanshanker Rai. He's Shekhar, a very nice boy. I heard you used to teach music to Sumita? Oh, it was nothing. Please sit down. Don't be humble. I was impressed by Sumita's singing. Why just singing? Shekhar may be an engineer, but look. He has sculpted those statues. And those two paintings... Yes, he has painted them. Beautiful. You are Michaelangelo. But I never heard that he could even sing. Don't joke, Kumar Bahadur. I am not joking, though our relationship is a joke. Relationship a joke? You go home. I will spend some time with Shekhar, and leave. As you wish. - Sumi, bless you, dear. - Father. Do write. Do write. Good bye. So tell me, when are you coming to our house? We'll chat later, first let's have some refreshments. Please, cut out the formalities. Come over in a day or two. If you don't, I'll come and take you by force. - Want to say something? - Madam is waiting for you. Escort Sumita to her room. You called for me? When you don't come on your own, I have to summon you. You have just forgotten the way to my room. Should I not fulfill my duty towards Sumita? What about your duty towards me? You are the lady of the house. Madam, queen, all the keys are with you. Madam? Queen? Nonsense! Keep your keys with you, or give them to Sumita. I want you, or return the life I lived 10 years ago. I don't know about myself, but the clock cannot be turned back. For you, me or anybody else. A mirror once broken, cannot be joined back. It has to be changed. I sing songs I hum away I had made a promise to laugh always That is why I am always smiling These moments of love are so precious My words are softer than flowers I shower everyone with these soft flowers I am always smiling Who knew there would be so much happiness My heart is blooming with joy My heart is clean I am always smiling You are joking once again, Kumar Bahadur. Shekhar, it is good to be humble... ...but not beyond a certain limit. She is my mother. Very different from the Rai family. I had molded myself to my mother's ideals. But since the last 7-8 years, I began to behave... ...like the blood thirsty Rais'. Look, you'll see signs of killing all around. Before leaving for Germany, even I liked to hunt. I have a gun too. Will you take me along? But I have promised to quit both, liquor, and hunting. I will once again follow my mother's ideals. Thus, I will begin life afresh. Will you help me? Sure, I will. Tell me what I have to do. You take care of Sumita. So that your laughter, your music... ...breaths fresh life into this lifeless Rai mansion. Help me. I didn't know you were so emotional. You didn't answer me. If that is what pleases you, I promise you. Thank you. - Shekhar is a talented boy. - Yes, very talented. He is not only an engineer, he even sculpts, paints, sings. - He's even handsome. - Yes, he looks good. Shekhar and Sumita's pair... What do you mean? Have you given a thought to the fact that they grew up together. They could have been in love with each other. Even their marriage could have been a possibility. What is this? You are leaving your meal... Listen! Sumita, is it true... ...that there were talks of your marriage with Shekhar? My mother and his aunt wanted it. And you? You didn't answer me. What did you want? Parent's wishes are important in such matters. Oh. So it can be said... ...that you didn't desire to marry me. No, I didn't say that. - Hello. - Hello. Sit down. Please be seated. Tell me, what can I do for you? I came here... I mean, Kumar Bahadur... But he suddenly left for hunting yesterday. Left for hunting? Then why today... - You are Shekhar? - Yes. - Haricharan. - Yes, madam. Escort him to Sumita's soon. But... Why? Are you afraid to enter the mansion in the master's absence? But Kumar Bahadur has told me... ...that whenever you come... ...you should be escorted to Sumita's room. - You... - I am Madhuri. The rest, you will know later. Haricharan, ask Myna to take him to Sumita. - Come, sir. - Go. Tell me, who is this Madhuri? I don't know, but everyone calls her madam. Even the house keys are with her. Nothing happens in this mansion without her consent. Even Kumar Bahadur does everything she says. Haven't you ever questioned Kumar Bahadur? No. It is forbidden to know too much in this house. Kumar Gyanshanker is truly a strange man. - Shekhar and Sumita's pair... - What do you mean? Have you given a thought to the fact that they grew up together. They could have been in love with each other. Even their marriage could have been a possibility. Sumita, is it true... ...that there were talks of your marriage with Shekhar? My mother and his aunt wanted it. And you? Parent's wishes are important in such matters. O heart, sing in tune Don't sing any note out of tune Life is a union of sorrow and happiness Like high notes with low Merge the two O heart, sing in tune - Master! - Master! Master, the lioness has been located... ...near the pond at the foot of the mountain. Your friend is very unfair to you. - My friend? - Your pupil is your friend. You return so late from office. Then you come here... ...and she doesn't even ask if you'll have something. I have heard no one does anything here without your orders. You've heard that? Then it's my mistake. Sit down. Please sit down. Please eat... Eat. Will you teach me to sing? Can you sing? If you teach me, I'll surely learn. Then I'll surely teach you. Thank you. You two make a lovely pair. You told me something? I was thinking that no one can still be so happy... ...after giving something that belongs to him to someone else. I don't understand. My misfortune. You didn't eat anything. I had enough. Good day. Kumar Bahadur has come. Get the ground almond for the sherbet. Ask Shivnandan to even get hot water for his bath here. And get his smoking pipe too. Hurry! - Chhotu. - Coming, madam. - Are you alright? - Yes. - How are you? - I am fine. But you look pale. I could not sleep all night because of a headache. I'm fine today. But you look very tired. Tired? Yes, really. Sumi, since that first day, I've not been able to hear you sing. Will you sing for me some day? Whenever you like. You know to cook, right? Some day... Why some day? Shall I cook today? You'll cook today? Alright. Chhotu, remove Kumar Bahadur's shoes. Keep this on the bed, he will wear them after his bath. The water is ready for your bath. I'll get sherbet for you. - Shyama. - Coming, madam. Alright then, we'll cook, mutton pulav, fish... ...pulses, prawns, chutney, and sweetened milk. And yes, I will cook all this. - What! Alright. - Ask Shibu to grind the spices. - Do we have all the spices? - Yes. Keep all this ready, I'm coming. - Madam... - Did you grind almonds? I did grind them, but Sumita madam called them to her room. I have asked Shibu to grind some more. Good. Bring them quickly. I'll check if Kumar Bahadur finished bathing. Listen... - Madam, ground almonds. - Take it back, Shyama. And ask Mishraji to cook the meal. Here, drink sherbet. Sumita is making almond sherbet for me. But you always had sherbet made by me. I didn't have Sumita then. I know. You brought me from Rainager to Barrackpur. And you have coronated her on the throne of Rainager. Sumita is the daughter-in-law of this royal family. That is where she won. But I am not ready to give up my right. Madhuri, why are you bent on breaking up Sumita's home? I am not so magnanimous to break my own home to make someone else's The day I killed this lioness... That same day, you saved me from bandits. And brought me here. And so that I don't forget this, you kept this skin here. To remind me that even I can meet the same fate as this lioness. Madhuri, release me. Let me go. Why don't you let Sumita go? Shekhar is waiting for it. Madam, you are crying? I am defeated. I lost everything. I am really defeated. I am defeated, Shekhar. I cannot take it any more. Come on, Sumi. Don't talk like that. Have patience. Be brave. Everything will be alright. No, nothing can be alright now. Now, there will only be ruin. Do you know, I have seen a streak of rage in Kumar Bahadur's eyes. I had seen it earlier too. I even fear for Sumita now. What have I done out of jealousy! Before leaving from here, I will have to atone for my mistake. Yes, I will have to atone. Manu, is Shekhar upstairs? Yes, madam. - Then will you do me a favour? - Sure, madam. Tell me. Listen. Madam, Kumar Bahadur is back. - Remember everything I told you? - Yes. And listen, switch off the hall lights. Okay. Don't cry Sumi, everything happens for good. For good? How can I assume that? Don't cry Sumi, I am with you. Look Sumi, everyone doesn't get happiness in life. And those who don't, have to win it with sacrifice and penance. Have patience. Be brave. I am always with you. Don't worry, everything will be alright. How long can I spend my nights staying up crying? You have forgotten what I told you. Remember, Kumar Bahadur is a helpless man. He needs support. He is your husband. Only you can give him love and caring. Mother, give me courage. Give me courage to bear this. Tell me mother, how do I keep him happy? - Sir! - What happened? Madam has suddenly taken ill. Kumar Bahadur is not home. If you could please come and look her up. Come... but how come the lights went off suddenly? Maybe some problem with the supply. You go to her room, I'll inform the office. Surprised? It's me. So this is your illness? I truly am very sick. Why have you called me here like this? If I hadn't called you like this, would you have come at all? - Madam Madhuri! - Just call me Madhuri. Just touch and see how hot my body it. Disgusting! You left in a huff that day. You will have to stay with me today. What's wrong with you? Leave me! No, I won't leave you. You should feel ashamed of yourself! You will have to leave. I know that. Because the respect I gave you, you misused it. Respect? Whose respect? Kumar Bahadur's mistress is not respected. Don't talk like that. Such temper on hearing the truth? Listen Madhuri, leave this house in a day or two. You are not worthy of my love. Love? You never loved me. You only love yourself. You only wanted to fulfil your desire to have a doll. I wanted to keep you as the lady of the house. But... Who asked you for this vain honour? Did you give me the status of a wife? No. Because you have bought me with money. You wanted to make me like you wanted me to be. But you had no patience. Like your other trophies, even I was left in a corner of the house. Did you look at me lovingly even once in the last 10 years? Did you notice how much worthy I made myself of you? You talk of love? You don't know to love. You don't understand a woman's feelings. You never can. What you did with Shekhar today... ...after that, don't you feel ashamed to say all this? No! And there is no point in telling you why I did that. You won't understand. You have gone mad with rage. - Mad? I am mad? - Yes, you are mad! Madhuri, you leave right now! - Where? On the street? - Wherever, but leave this place. If you need money, take it from the cashier. Alright. I cannot tell you my new address, I'll inform you later. I don't need to know your address. But when your game with the new doll is over... ...when you throw Sumita out, she will need my address. Because you have bought Sumita too. You don't love her. Great, Chhotu! You really are brave. - But atleast hold the gun right. - What? - Is Kumar Bahadur home? - He's gone out with Sumita madam. - Where did they go suddenly? - I don't know. But he said they are going on a tour around the country. - When did they go? - Two days ago. A day before they left, even Madhuri madam left. Madhuri madam left? Yes, first she left, then Kumar Bahadur and madam. - Here's your reward. - Reward? Keep it. You've given me very good news. This tomb of Chisti. Any wish you ask for is fulfilled here. That is what the people believe. Emperor Akbar had asked for a son from him... ...who could be the heir to the Mughul throne. I know. And that son was Salim, who became the Emperor. Look, so many people have tied... ...the thread for their wish fulfillment since then. - Even I will tie a thread. - Okay. Here. What will you wish for? Why don't you tell me? What wish are you making that you cannot tell me? Dear Shekhar, I took Sumita and left on a tour suddenly. We visited quite a few places. We are in Agra since 2-3 days. We are planning to stay here for a few more days. You also come here. It's the full moon night in a few days. Come before that. Even Sumita will be happy. Do come. Bring along your gun. Don't forget. You had once said you haven't used your gun since many days. We can take care of that complain too. Get up, it's going to be evening now. - Come on. - Will I have to come? - But where? - You are strange, Kumar Bahadur. You said we will go out in the evening. Now you don't even want to step out of the hotel. Shekhar, I have visited Agra 13 times. That's bad. Unlucky 13! Sumita has come. Look Sumita, you two go. Why delay? You must not waste the time that is left. - Won't you come along? - That is what I am telling him. - But he refuses to listen. - But why? I am not feeling well. Then we won't go today. You are not feeling well. We'll go tomorrow. No, Shekhar is our guest. We have called him from so far. He has taken pains to come here. We should not disappoint him. - What are you thinking? - He is not feeling well. I am not enjoying this outing. You are right, even I'm not enjoying it. Sumi, how badly we misunderstand people. Now look, it is not at all difficult to understand Kumar. So simple, so open minded. He is a little whimsical, but... God! Started giving your lecture again? I am not lecturing, I am telling the truth. The more I'm getting to know him, the more I like him. No one can give me so much love and understanding. Alright, now let's go. A crowd of people come here to see this. But no one thinks, that when everyone has to die one day... ...then why do we have feelings of enmity, jealousy, killing? My legs will tire walking with you. Sumi, sitting here, Emperor Shahjahan... ...used to watch his monument of love, the Taj Mahal. I really feel sad for Shahjahan. Shekhar, remember Tagore's poem 'Shahjahan'... ...which you had translated. Recite it for me. I have heard it several times from you before. But I never have enough of it. Playing 'Patience'? To check how much patience I have. What did you find? I forget the Queen and the Jack among the other numbers. I do notice the Jack sometimes, but I cannot find the Queen. The poor King is left alone. Anyway, forget that. Tell me, how did you enjoy the Taj Mahal by moonlight? It was beautiful. A companion you like, moonlit night, mysterious Taj. - What do you mean? - I mean, Sumita. She understands the Taj Mahal's beauty. Please sit down. Shekhar, even I am not a bad companion. On the 17th, the full moon night, when you come to see... ...Fatehpur Sikri with me, you will know. I have heard of seeing the Taj on the full moon night. Everyone has seen the Taj, but one who has not seen... ...Fatehpur Sikri on full moon night, has not seen Agra. - What are you saying? - I'm telling the truth. But there is something. Are you afraid of ghosts? Not at all. But what connection do ghosts have with Fatehpur Sikri? They do. That is why I asked you to get your gun. You are joking. And anyway, even if I believe you... ...what can we do? Ghosts don't have a body. Nothing will happen to the ghost, but it will give us courage. How? Come, Sumi. Shekhar wants to see Fatehpur Sikri with us... ...on full moon night. - I told him... - There are ghosts there. - But I don't believe him. - You don't? Sumi, shall I tell him Negro Suleiman's story... ...which I'd told you? Why are you unnecessarily scaring him? - I'm not scared. - Shekhar, don't blame me later. Sumi, you are witness. Neither will I blame you, nor do I need her evidence. - Let's go. - Now? - Right now. - We need to prepare ourselves. - Prepare for what? - Have patience, Shekhar. Patience pays. - Sumita, even you will come? - At night, in this cold weather? No. I have seen it by day. Did you finish taking his measurements? What? I asked, did you finish taking his measurement? Yes. These clothes must reach the hotel by the 15th. What? These clothes must reach the hotel by the 15th. Sure. Good day. This shoes is okay, send it to the hotel. Sure. Tailor's shop, a traditional footwear. What is all this about? We are going to Fatehpur Sikri on the night of 17th, right? Yes, but what is all this for? Without the Mughul attire, and Mughul spirit... ...you will not see Fatehpur Sikri's true shades. Are you alright? ...Come. Shekhar, if we stand on that terrace... ...we will be able to hear the clang of swords... ...the tinkle of anklets, romantic words... ...and tales of conspiracy. They are all hidden in these stones. On a full moon night, they all come out. They talk, sing, laugh. And sharpen swords on the stone. Look, that's the Minar. Imagine. Two elephants are fighting with full force to kill each other. Do you hear the elephants grunting? Yes. Give me some more wine. Shekhar, this is Emperor Akbar's Hindu wife, Jodhabai's palace. That's his Christian wife, Mariam's palace. When the Quran was read in the Masjid... ...Hindu mantras were read in Jodhabai's palace. And the Bible chants were heard from Mariam's palace. Emperor Akbar used to sit here and hear Tansen's music... ...spellbound. Can you hear the heartbeats of Fatehpur Sikri? Do you feel the mystery of the full moon night? Yes, I'm seeing it, I hear it. I see everything before my eyes. Give me more wine. Shekhar, you stay here, I'll just be back. I'll keep this here. - You won't get scared, will you? - Ofcourse not. - Why... - Who is it? This is not loaded. Give it to me. Let's go. In that room, as per Emperor Akbar's wishes... ...the great poet Faizi, translated the Mahabharat... ...in Urdu. And narrated the eternal love story of Nal Damyanti. - Can you hear it, Shekhar? - Yes, Kumar Bahadur. I see everything clearly. Look, Emperor Akbar and the Queen is sitting on the throne. And the most beautiful woman of the Harem... ...salutes, and begins to sing. The flattering steps start moving again I give you peace and become restless myself Look! That beautiful dancer's name is Khurshid. She will come to Gulbag after she finishes her dance. Do you know why? Her two lovers are desperate for her. One hand is waiting, Mubarrak... ...and on the other, is Umrao Sallauddin. Blinded by jealousy... ...Mubarrak had imprisoned Sallauddin slave, Negro Suleiman. Because Suleiman has forcibly taken Kurshid... ...and put her in Sallauddin lap. Mubarrak tied up Suleiman in chains. And then skinned him with his sword and killed him. And then, one day, carrying a gun in hand... ...Mubarrak hid himself behind that pillar. Kurshid was coming to meet Sallauddin. Seeing her, Mubarrak fired a shot. Kurshid fell dead. While dying, Kurshid said... 'Dear Mubarrak, there was poison mixed in the wine' 'And that goblet was for Sallauddin' 'And there was love in my heart for you' Hearing this, Mubarrak shuddered. In that crazy moment, he shot himself too. Do you know, Kurshid, Suleiman, Mubarrak's souls... Look! Negro Suleiman is coming. Negro Suleiman is coming. Negro Suleiman is coming! Shekhar, don't be afraid, he ran away. Look! Kurshid is coming. Desire! Wish! Sumi, in this attire? Over here? How? Why Sumi, why?! - To scare you. - Scare me? - And that Suleiman, the gunshot? - It was all an act. And the bullet that hit me was real. Shekhar, call him here. Call him, please! Call him, Shekhar. Blinded by jealousy, what a disastrous thing you have done. What have you done! Listen... listen. I love only my husband. You had asked me that day... ...what I wished for at Chisti's tomb? I wished to be a mother. What! You wanted to be a mother? Believe me, that is what I wished for that day. I wished to sire your children. Sumi, why didn't you tell me this before? It's too late now. What have I done? What will I do now? What will I do now? What will I do now? - What are you doing! - Leave me, Shekhar. What kind of madness is this? - Let me atone for my sin. - No, Kumar. Sumita is calling me. She is waiting for me. There is only one bullet in this. I won't let you do this. - Leave me. - No! I killed you too! Shekhar, I killed you too! Sumi, I killed Shekhar too. Sumi, listen. Are you listening? I killed Shekhar and even you. You are laughing Sonmai? Because your curse has come true? Laugh... laugh... laugh! Queen Sonmai, your curse has come true. Laugh! Curse more! Yes, I committed the murders. I killed Shekhar. I killed Sumita. Because Sumita loved Shekhar. Mad? Kumar turned mad? God, what have you done! Sumita and Shekhar's souls wander here even today. Every full moon night in the month of 'Maghi', at sharp 12... Look! Sumita is coming. It is very late. Go home now. - You! - I am alive. Every year, on the full moon night of 'Maghi'... ...I have to enact Sumita's role. Or I cannot take him home. Good bye. Listen. Let's go now. - But the blood? - It is washed clean now. Really? Is it washed clean? Yes, it's clean. It's clean.
