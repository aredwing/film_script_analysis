Please come in, Miss Bowman. Mr. Donne's expecting you. Thank you. This way, please. David. Hello, Jenny. Is this awfully inconvenient? I don't think so. Come on up. I'll take your coat. That's for social calls. Well, you did say this was business, didn't you? Yes, Doctor. Business. Well, the business department is in here. Why do they call you Mister if you're a doctor? Surgeons are called Mister. I see. You mean like a marquis being called a lord? That always mixes me up, too. Secrets of the trade. Won't you sit down? - Yes. Thank you. - Now, then, what is it? Ear, nose, or throat? Do you take care of all three of those things? Yes. Which is it? Were you surprised to hear from me? A little. You sang this afternoon. Charity concert, wasn't it? Yes. How do you know? It was in all the papers. How did it go? - It was ghastly. - That means it was good. No, it was terrible. It was awful. My throat was very raw, and I couldn't... I just sort of croaked out the performance. Tell me, am I keeping this secretary person of yours? No, no. She works here. I know, but it's terribly late, and it's Sunday, and I thought... She's used to it. Will you go on? Well, I just... I just got scared I was going to lose my voice. Since when? Since when what? Since when were you scared that you were losing your voice? Well, since I got to England. And don't tell me it's the climate... because Tepaldi and Callas sing here... and they do very well. Shall we take a look? Would you come over here, please? Sit down. How are your sinuses? I don't know. They're kind of... - Any colds recently? - No. You used to have a lot of colds. Yes, but then they invented paper handkerchiefs... and that sort of took the fun out of it. Would you open your mouth, please? Wide. Thank you. All right. Say ahh. Thank you. Now I'm going to have a look at your larynx. I'm going to take this piece of gauze... Gauze, and you're going to hold my tongue with it... and you want me to relax and breathe slowly in and out... - and completely... - Would you just do it? - Yes, I will. - Thank you. Would you put out your tongue? Yes, thank you. You know, I've been thinking... Would you just sit there for a moment? Would you come back? Excuse me. I've been thinking about Atlantic City. Do you ever think about Atlantic City, David? Yes, I have done. Does this hurt? Would you swallow? Thank you. Well, am I going to lose my voice, or what? What do you think? You mean there's nothing wrong with me. Your throat's a bit rough, it's red, you've been singing... and you've been smoking too much. When do you open in London? Five days. Look, do you mind if I get out of... I'm very sorry. Of course, do. I'll give you something to ease the roughness. Not that you'll take it. But if you have got five days... I strongly urge you to take three of them off. What would you advise, a brisk walk through Hyde Park? Sleep, rest, relaxation. Where can I buy those? Have a gargle night and morning. All right. Well, why don't you get me off on the right foot... by offering me a drink? You're going to get me in there if it kills me, aren't you? All right. It's still scotch? Still scotch. No ice, I'm afraid. That's all right. Thank you. You know, you've changed. Well, I'd be scared to hell if I hadn't. And you've become so... careful. Have I? Well, it comes, you know. Care comes. With gray hair and spectacles. I heard about your wife's death. Janet was her name? Yes. Janet. - I read about your marriage. - Which one? Well, it doesn't make any difference... because neither one was worth writing home about. I should have married you, David. I really should have. And it would have worked. Yes, it would. No, you're wrong, Jenny. - You're so sure? - It's better as it is. Tell me something... do you still play that awful harmonica thing? No. No, I gave that up. I'm glad. You were terrible. Do you still knit? Oh, no. Nothing I knitted ever fitted. We must have had fun, David. At least, that's the way I remember it. Is that the way you remember it? Yes. Twist my arm and yes. Salut. Salut. Why did you come? I don't know. To tell you the truth, I don't know. Maybe it's just that I didn't want to be alone... first night in a strange town. You've a mass of friends in town. You couldn't be alone. Alone. It's a most awful word. And I know what it means. Because I've been alone since you, David. You've been married twice. Well, I was alone then, too. Tell me, is this when you were knighted? The C.B.E. Or the... - O.B.E. - O.B.E. That's good, isn't it? Not quite, I'm afraid. That's something. Yes, it's something. Why did you hide him from me? - I didn't hide him. - I saw you. All right, I hid him. Excuse me, Mr. Donne. Do you require me for anything else? No, thank you, Miss Plimpton. I'll see Miss Bowman out. - Good night, Miss Bowman. - Good night. Is he here? No, he's at school. He boards. - I'd love to see him. - I know. David, please. I didn't come here to ask that, I swear. I came here to see you. I admit that. It's just that now that I am here... I must ask you. Please. I'm sorry, Jenny. You can't see him. Well, why not? What's the matter with me? Have I some dread disease or some kind of... What are you so afraid of? What is it, David? - I want to see him! - It's impossible. Impossible isn't a word that very many people use with me. It must come as rather a surprise to you now. - I want to see him. - You cannot see him, Jenny. We made an agreement a long time ago... an agreement that you wanted... never to see him ever again. Do you remember? Yes, I remember. That was a long time ago. It's the only good thing I ever made in my life. Now I can't... Well, forget it. Tell me, does he like school? I mean, any more than anyone does? Yes, he likes it very much. Is he clever? He's average. Better at Mozart than maths. Is he musical? A little odd if not. Yes. And the rest? He's really pretty good. I think you'd be proud of him. - Let me see him. - No. - Just once. - And then what? Nothing. I go. Look, Jenny, to see him now would make it much harder... for you, for me, for all of us. And that's final? Final. Well, I think I've taken up enough of your time, David... and I'd like to get out of here. Where's my coat? It's outside. I'll call you a cab. - No, thank you. I'd rather walk. - It won't take a moment. No, thank you. I'd rather walk. Don't bother to see me out. I'll take care of myself. Jenny. What? You forgot your prescription. What does it say? Three times a day before meals? And shake the bottle. It's good for what ails me? Good night, David. You've been very kind, and thank you. Jenny. It really would mean so much to you, wouldn't it? To see him again? Yes. If I let you... and mark these words... if I let you... you'll promise to look once and never look again? I promise. All right. Are you sure you want to go on? Well, I can't stop now or I'll sink. Peel it, Joe, peel it! Tell me, do all the mothers do this? Yes. But they usually wear good woman's shoes. Where is Matt? Is he... No, he's with that lot over there. The under-14s. Come on, Roger, don't fall! Give me the ball! Come on, Roger! David, wait a minute. Here. - Are you holding? - I'm holding. You really should have worn more sensible shoes. They're all yours. I'll take this. Come on, on to the under-14s. Where is he, David? Where? There. Where? There. That thing with the ball. Tackle him! - They'll kill him! - Only once. Break up. Halftime. Well, what's that? That's halftime. You must come 'round, especially the wing forwards. Can I go and see my father, sir? Yes, all right. Hop it. Hello, Father. Nine to six against us. We're getting ticked off. Still, it's a good game. They made you fly half again. What happened to Gregson? Broke his leg playing Eastbourne. - Silly ass. - I'm faster, anyway. - Don't be such a show-off. - Hello. Hello. You're Miss Bowman, aren't you? Father said you were coming. Miss Bowman's an American, Matt. They do things differently. How do you do? How do you do? You're going to be on in London, aren't you? - Yes, I'm going to be on. - At the Palladium. We have all your records at the house. At home? No, no. The house here at the school. Father goes in more for Beethoven. For Pete's sake. Who introduced you to Ella... to Basie, to Benny Goodman? Yes, I know. And who introduced you to Chubby Checker? I have an extra pair of boots in my locker. You could always pretend you've been playing fly half. - I think they'd suspect. - Sorry. No, Matt, I have these. I'm saving them for a dry day. He looks like you. I shouldn't. I'm adopted. Well, you could. You could. Adopted children do grow like their parents, like dogs. Like dogs? Yes. There's an old saying that dogs grow like their masters. Or masters grow like their dogs. I think you'd better get back to that game, don't you? I'll take Miss Bowman back to the hotel... and get her cleaned up, all right? I'll show you around the school, Miss Bowman. Matt, do we have to? I'd like that, Matt. I'd love it. These ruins are Norman. You know, 1066 and all that stuff. The school buildings are all around the cathedral... and they're just as old. The dining hall goes back to King Henry V. And the food goes back to William the Conqueror. Good morning, sir. Major Dee, Modern Languages. We call him Major Disaster. Is the biology wing finished yet? It's been finished for ages. Most parents get down twice a term... but I'm lucky if my father gets down once a year. Now, that is not true. And what happens when I do come down? We stare at each other like a couple of deaf-mutes. - Unless you need some cash. - But today's different. You get a jolly good view from around this corner. We have all our services in the cathedral. That's the school choir you can hear... practicing in there now. Would you like to go up the tower? We can see for twenty miles. No, Matt, not again. You can do it, Father. Exercise is good for you. I wasn't thinking about myself, but Miss Bowman. I took Auntie Beth up last week and she loved it. Who's Auntie Beth? She's Father's aunt and she's sixty. Well, if Auntie Beth can do it, so can I. Come on, Father. Come on. We go through there. I'll have to get permission from the verger. I won't be a moment. I like him. So do I. I feel so happy. It's like having a family of my own. Lovely feeling. Good. Would you have dinner with me tonight, David? I don't think so. I'm going to be in London ten more days... and I'd love to see more of you. You really are persistent, aren't you? A little over-anxious, maybe. Look, I tell you what we're going to do. We're going to come down from that tower... if we ever reach the top, we'll take Matt out to tea... we'll stuff him full of food... and then I'll drive you back to London. And drop me at my hotel? That's right. It'll be better that way, don't you think? No, I don't. We can go up now. You will be down by 4:30, won't you? Yes, thank you. We'll hurry. I'll lead. Every twenty steps, stop and count five. That way, you won't get out of breath. Go on, Matt, go on. Everyone all right? Fine. Fine! There are 237 steps. I've counted them. What did he say? He says he's counted the steps! What does he want to count them for? It's hard enough to climb them. By the way, I ordered extra tickets. What tickets? For the Gilbert and Sullivan, tonight. It's the end of term play. We're doing the first act of "H.M.S. Pinafore." Eighteen, nineteen, twenty. What was that? He says he's got tickets for the play tonight! Is this the top? No. But we're almost halfway. Oh, my. This is fun, isn't it? Mind the cobwebs. Not many people get up here. Matt, I'm terribly sorry. We can't stay for the show tonight. Miss Bowman has to get back to town. But he must stay. I'm playing Cousin Hebe. He says you must stay, because he's playing Cousin Hebe. Blast. I think we've lost your father. Not much further. I can see daylight. How old was that aunt you were talking about? She's sixty. But she's very athletic. I can believe that. She must be a champion long distance runner. Oh, my gosh, look out! - Be careful! - It's all right. You have to get to the edge to get the view. Look. You can see Ashford from here... where the Vikings fought. Please say you'll stay for the show, Miss Bowman... because if you do, then Father will have to stay, too. I'll talk to him. Somebody didn't stop to count five. Be generous, David. He wants you to stay so much. You can see the sea on a clear day. But we don't get many clear days. Good, we are in luck! - What's wrong? - Wait for it. - What's happening? - You'll see. That's the loudest bell in the south of England! My! For a British tar is a soaring soul For a British tar is a soaring soul As free as a mountain bird His energetic fist should be ready to resist A dictatorial word His eyes should flash with an inborn fire His brow with scorn be wrung He never should bow down to a domineering frown Or the tang of a tyrant tongue His nose should pant and his lips should curl His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl His bosom should heave and his heart should glow And his fist be ever ready for a knock-down blow His foot should stamp and his throat should growl His hair should twirl and his face should scowl His eyes should flash and his breast protrude And this should be his customary attitude His eyes should flash His breast protrude His eyes His customary attitude His eyes should flash His breast protrude His eyes should flash His eyes Yes, his eyes, his eyes should flash His foot should stamp and his throat His throat should growl His hair should twirl and his face His face should scowl And this should be his customary Attitude Bravo! God save our gracious Queen Long live our noble Queen God save our Queen Send her victorious Happy and glorious Long to reign over us God save our Queen Who's that? That's the headmaster. We can go now. We used to do Gilbert and Sullivan in our school. Only the girls played the boys' parts. I can't get over Matt... he's so pretty. Well, don't tell him that, for heaven's sake. - All right. - I'm never sure with you. - Did you enjoy it, Mr. Donne? - Yes, thank you very much. You directed the play, didn't you? We loved it. This is Mr. Reynolds, Miss Bowman. How do you do? I'm afraid we're not exactly in your class. I'd say much more professional and more spirited, too. That's very kind of you. The boys do try. There he is. Could l... Excuse me. - Say, you were terrific. - Was it all right? - It really was. - Did you like it? Yes, really. What do you think of Buttercup? He was ace, wasn't he? I think everybody was ace. Would you like to meet some of them? I'd love to. This is Miss Bowman. This is Bobbie Evans. Hello. Josephine, you look stunning. You were marvelous. And this is Ralph Rackstraw... the finest topman in all the fleet. Hello. Glad to see you. Lovely performance. Thank you very much. The Right Honorable Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B. First Lord of the Admiralty. The monarch of the sea. And these are all his sisters and his cousins and his aunts. I think you were all absolutely marvelous. - We think you're marvelous. - I think you're better. - We think you're marvelous! - No, you're better! Why don't you sing for us, Miss Bowman? Yes, Miss Bowman, sing for us. Yes! Yes! Yes! Well, we've got a piano. Let's all play together. OK? Shall we have a go? Yes! I am the monarch of the sea The ruler of the Queen's Navee Aren't you a bit young? Whose praise Great Britain loudly chants And we are his sisters and his cousins and his aunts And you? And we are his sisters and his cousins and his aunts His sisters and his cousins and his aunts They are his sisters and his cousins and his aunts - Ahnts! - No! Ants! When at anchor here I ride My bosom swells with pride You do look a bit strange. And I snap my fingers at the foreman's taunts You'll never beat him that way, kid. And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts His sisters and his cousins and his aunts They're his sisters and cousins and aunts They're his sisters And his cousins And his sisters and his... You and I are the only ones doing any work around here. Come on, we must all pull together! Let's go! Go! But when the breezes blow Where do you go? I generally go below Why? To seek the seclusion that a cabin grants You're chicken! You're chicken! And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts All those people in one cabin? It must have been very crowded. So do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts I won! Hey, Matt! I've got a marvelous idea. You had me to your opening night. - Now I want you to come to mine. - The Palladium?! Yes. Would you like that? Gosh, yes. If my father won't mind. We can bring him, too. What do you say? Shall we bring him along? Yes, if you're sure it'll be all right. I do. I think he should definitely come, too. - Come on, let's ask. - I'll ask him, yes. Please, sir. Father, can I go to Miss Bowman's show? You remember? You promised me three days in London. Mr. Reynolds. - Oh, say yes. - Will you excuse me? Yes, of course. What are you talking about? Miss Bowman's invited us to the first night of her show... for both of us. Well, why not, David? Best seats in the house for you and Matt. You're supposed to spend the first week of your holiday... in Canterbury with Aunt Beth, and you know that. Well, she won't mind. I know she won't mind. Please, Father. You can buy me that tape recorder you promised me. I'd love to come and see you, Miss Bowman. Make him say yes. I don't seem to have any choice, do I? I don't think so. I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts There they all hanging in a row Big ones, small ones Some as big as your head Give 'em a twist, a flick of the wrist That's what the showman said I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts Every ball you throw will make you rich And there stands me wife The idol of me life Singing roll a bowl, a ball a penny a pitch - She's here. - Yeah? How is she? Fine. So smile. Hi, darling. George. Telegram from David Donne. Urgent case. Terribly sorry and all that. Best of British luck and everything, but... In plain American, he ain't comin'. So? So... Well, what do we do, deliver it? You want to blow the show? Yeah. I'll tell her it came after she went on. How do you feel, honey? Hey, did you see 'em out front? Cops on horseback. You can't rate any higher. - London's my lucky town. - Any town's your lucky town. I could live in London, George. I really could. I could settle here. Any old iron, any old iron, any, any... George, you sent the tickets, didn't you? - They're at the box office. - And David's picking them up? That's right, darling. Good. I feel marvelous! Come on, Ida! Any, any, any old iron - How do I look? - Fabulous. - I mean really. - Really fabulous. Darling, shall I start the overture? Well, what time is it? Twenty past. That's funny. They said they were going to come backstage... before the show. They probably thought you meant after the show. They didn't want to disturb you. George, will you call the box office for me, please? Honey, I just called. There's a lot of confusion. They're all jammed up. He may have got caught in the traffic. That's the price of popularity, darling. - What's going on? - What do you mean? Just what I said... what's going on? Honey, you know everything that I know. Don't get upset. I'm not upset, George, but I'm liable to get very upset... if I don't find out what's going on! Give it to her. He said he was going to come. Jenny, I know this is a big disappointment to you... but you expected 2,500 people, but you got 2,498. That's an awful lot of people. What do you say? Come in. Mr. Donne to see you, Miss Bowman. Show him in, please. All right, you can go in now. - Hello, Matt. - Hello. How nice you look. Come in. Come in, please. Gosh, it's a bit different from school, isn't it? How do you do, sir? Hi. Good evening. How do you do? Matt, did your father bring you? Didn't you get the telegram? He got a call from Italy. An emergency case. It's standing room only outside. George, will you start the overture, please? Right. Would you excuse me? I'll be right back. - OK, Ida? - Yep. Fine. Turn around. - The seams all right? - Splendid. There you go. I hope it was all right... my coming. It's more than all right. As a matter of fact... it's a great big compliment to me that you came. I'd have been awfully disappointed if you hadn't. Come on, let's go. Actually, you see, I came up to town on my own. They don't know I'm here. You mean your father doesn't know? No. He thinks I'm in Canterbury. But I wouldn't miss your opening night for anything. Listen, Matt, you're going to see my show... and then we're going to have supper together... and then I think I'll bed you down at the Savoy... and after that, we'll get your tape recorder tomorrow... that he promised you... and a couple of other things, maybe. That sounds marvelous. But I think Aunt Beth would worry... No, don't worry about that. You'll take care of Aunt Beth, won't you, Ida? Yes, I'll call Aunt Beth. - Joe. - Yes, Miss. Would you show this young man to his seat, please? - Yes, certainly. - Good luck, Miss Bowman. Thank you. You know, we may have such a good time tonight... your father will be sorry he missed it. - Good-bye. - Bye. Did you check the fuse box? Well, something looks like it's out. Check it, and fix it fast. Honey, it's a gas! Gimme! Gimme! - Go! - Yeah! Hey! Hear that bluebird up in a tree Hear him What a song Joy he's bringing Singing to me Singing all day long Good-bye to skies of gray For I'm back home Today All day long I jump and run about You can always hear me shoutin' out Hello Bluebird Got no time For blues or anything I'm so happy I just want to sing Hello Bluebird Blue skies, sunshine Friends that are real Old folks, sweetheart Oh, how I feel I'll not go roamin' Like I did again I'll stay home and be a kid again Hello, bluebird Hello All day long I keep singing Hello, I'm glad I found you Bluebird, make yourself at home No more blues Just because I'm happy When I'm around you Bluebird No more need to roam Up above the sun is shinin' The world is ideal I just can't describe The marvelous way that I feel With nothin' but the bluest skies ahead What a rosy future lies ahead Thank you, bluebird Happy, happy bluebird Mister bluebird Hello This is a good idea, coming on the river. There's St. Paul's. Christopher Wren designed it. Are you cold? Not a bit. We take cold baths every morning at school. But we can get some shelter further up there. Everyone's watching you. Does it bother you? Oh, no. It doesn't bother me. Tell me, do you like living at school... the way you do, all the time? I don't mind. I've been away from home since I was eight. Don't you get lonesome for your family? I haven't really got a family. Father's away quite a bit. - He's rather busy, you know. - Yes, I know. It's the same for you, too, isn't it? I mean, you don't get home very often, either. No. That puts us in the same boat, then. Yes. I have to get off at the next landing stage. If I don't, I'll miss my train. I don't want to rush you. It's no rush. Can I have your autograph, please, Miss Bowman? - There you are. - Thank you. Thank you. Matt, why do we have to get off here? Why don't we have the whole day together? - I couldn't. - Yes, you could. Stay with me. Spend the day with me. Do me a favor. Come on. There's a 6:56, but I'd have to let them know. I fixed it last night, didn't I? - You did. - I'll fix it again tonight. - Come on! - All right. I beg your pardon. Faster, faster, faster... - Here. - Oops. We're locked out. That was a nice day. Don't panic, Ida. We're here. We've been all the way up the river... Down. And all the way down the strand. Up. I haven't had so much fun in years. You got messages. Press conference tomorrow at noon. Rehearsal's at 3:00. Phone calls... Your agents, New York... George, several times. And they left the hats. Good! You can help me pick one out. I made that call to Canterbury... but I don't see how he's going to make the 6:56. I've got news for you, Ida. Matt's going to be my guest... for one more night and one more morning. We're going to the ionic propulsion exhibition... at the science museum. So it looks like you're gonna have to make another call. Look, why don't you go powder your nose or something? OK. Canterbury wasn't any too happy when I called this afternoon. In fact, Canterbury's getting just a little irritated with us. I'm sure you took care of everything, Ida. Do you think this is my style? How long is this going on? What do you mean? You know what I mean. I took him out for the day. What's so wrong with that? Look, Jenny, this is me, see? Ida. Eighteen years. Remember? I just want to get to know him a little better. And then what? Let him go home, Jenny. Tomorrow. Why don't you quit while you're ahead? You wanted to see him. Fine, you saw him. Now say good-bye. - We blew the recording room. - George! Hi. When did you get back? Look, are you all right? - We were worried. - I'm fine! Look, if you ever get hung up again, let us know. We'd work it out for you. That's what we're here for. You still here? Good evening, sir. Yeah. I'll set it up again. Are we on our way? Are you ready, honey? Jenny, I don't think I ought to stay. I'm keeping you from important things. Nothing's that important, Matt. I haven't missed a thing. George, I have a new escort tonight... and a very attractive one, too. See you later. Come on. I've been running through rains And the wind that follows after For one certain face And an unforgotten laughter I've been following signs I've been searching through the lands For a certain pair of arms And a certain pair of hands Yes, I tried a kiss here And I tried a kiss there For when you're out in company The boys and girls will pair But it never was you It never was anywhere you An occasional sunset reminded me Or a flower hanging high on a tulip tree Or one red star hung low in the west Or a heartbreak call From a meadowlark's nest Made me think For a moment Maybe it's true I found him in the star In the call In the blue But it never was you It never was anywhere You Anywhere Anywhere You Anyone for ionic propulsion? She's out. That's French for not up yet. I wouldn't want to disturb her. Go right ahead. She won't even hear you. Jenny. Jenny, it's quarter to 12:00. Jenny? What... Good morning, Jenny. I'm sorry l... Good morning, darling. Is it awfully late? No, not really. Weren't we supposed to be someplace this morning? The science museum. But it doesn't matter. I'm sorry, Matt. Please come and sit down. We could queue. We could what? Stand in line. We don't want to do that, do we? I've got a much, much better idea. She's not back. Nope. Just a call to call Canterbury. Yeah. She's out of her so-called mind. More than you know. Yeah, in the middle of a six-country tour. - Seven. - Seven. They're gonna murder me. - Cigar. - Cigar. Good afternoon, girls. Girls, listen, Jenny has asked me to stand in for her. Now, wait a minute, now. Come on, let's be fair. You know she loves to talk to the ladies of the press. She's very disappointed that she can't be here... but eat, drink, be merry. Have any questions, think of me as though I were Jenny, OK? When did you start smoking cigars? Where is she? Give me that, will ya? She had a business date. Well, it went on way behind time! Way, way behind. What did you say the name of this place was? Stoke Poges. Stoke Poges? It's where Gray wrote his elegy. Do you know about that? No. I know more about Gray's Anatomy. - Stoke Poges? - That's right. "The path of glory leads but to the grave." Oh, dear. Do you ever look at gravestones? - No. - They're great fun. Fun?! Yes. They're not a bit depressing, really. Listen to this. "Here lies my wife. "Here let her lie. "Now she's at rest, and so am I." That's terrible. You're a terrible boy. When I die, I think I'll be cremated. - Would you like to be cremated? - I don't know. I suppose so. It's very sanitary and sort of chic, like I said. My mother was cremated. Your mother? Janet. But she's not my real mother. She must have loved you very much. She liked me. Come on, let's sit down for a second, shall we? Don't you ever wonder about your mother, your real mother? Not really. I mean, who she was and what... No. I'll miss you, Jenny. Will you? Yes. Matt, I'm going to go to Paris in a few days... and I wish you could come with me... just for a little while. I'll talk to your father about it... and I'll make all the arrangements. All you have to do is say yes. Jenny, I don't understand why you're being so kind to me. Maybe it's because I've never had a son of my own... and I like to pretend... and you fit the bill. Will you help me? Yes, Jenny. Good, Matt. Good. - I thought you'd got lost. - No. - Miss Bowman's here. - Is she? She said she wanted to talk to you urgently... as soon as you were back. Then she decided to come here and meet you. - Where is she? - She's in her car, over there. I didn't know what you wanted to do... so I brought your car as arranged. - Is she still at the Savoy? - Yes. Look, take my car back to town, will you? Take it to the hotel. Leave the keys with the porter... - and take that along. - Yes, of course. I'll be back as soon as I can. - How was your trip? - Fine. You were in Rome, weren't you? That's right, yes. Must have been an opera singer. They're very delicate creatures, opera sing... David, I have a confession to make. Really? Yes. I'm afraid I've done something that I shouldn't have. Yes, I know that. You know? News travels, Jenny, even to Rome. Are you terribly angry? I'm so sick with anger that I can hardly speak to you. I don't know what to say. I haven't got any excuses except that it was wonderful... There's only one thing I want to know from you. How far have you broken your promise? I haven't said anything, I swear. I know you're angry, but I haven't done any harm. That remains to be seen, doesn't it? If I'm such a shady character... why'd you let me see him in the first place? Have you forgotten how you begged... how you implored, how you pleaded, how... I don't beg. I don't beg. You don't beg. You just damn well assume. Everything you want, you get. - David. - You haven't changed. You never will. You're nothing but a self-centered... grasping, egocentric little bitch. And you're a cheat. Before you go in there and start to act like the heavy father... it wasn't his fault. I brought this about myself. And you remember that. Ida? Would you get Matt for me, please? Hello, Father. I wanted to come down to the airport with Jenny... but she said better not. She said that she'd explain about everything... about Paris and all that. Matt, we didn't win. Jenny explained everything perfectly, Matt. All I want you to do now is to pack up and come along. - Are you ready? - No, I'm not quite packed. Nothing much, though. It won't take long. Hurry up, then. The car's outside. - Yes, sir. - Right. So now it's Paris, is it? And then the rest of the tour, Rome, Athens... For God's sake, don't sulk. You saw his face. For God's sake, don't sulk. You saw his face. You saw how sorry he was. And you know how sorry I am. What do you want us both to do, just die? I don't want you to do anything. I just want to get out of here as soon as possible. What was so terrible about it, anyway? He came to see the show, we took a trip up the river... and we had a good time. What's so terrible about that? We had a wonderful time! And you're standing there... as if I'm some kind of criminal or something... - like I'm Lizzie Borden! - For God's sake, Jenny... "For God's sake, Jenny"! I stayed out of the way as long as your wife was around! And she was good for him! Well, fine! But what now? You and your grave demeanor or your Auntie Beth... in Canterbury who's forty years too late?! What kind of life are you offering him?! What you fail to realize, Jenny... is that we have a very good relationship, Matt and I. We were doing very well before you came along... and we'll do a damn sight better after you've gone! Boy, you know where to hit, don't you? I want to tell you something. He needs me, and I want him! He's not yours to have. You gave him back to me a long time ago. I need him, I love him, and... "You need him, and I want him, and you want him, and I..." He's not a bone. My God, he's a child. He's my son, and I'm going to keep him! There's just one thing we seem to both have forgotten. He's my son, too. I made him. Now, where do we go from there? I've packed. There's some other things in the bedroom, but... We'll send for those later, Matt. Yes. Can I have the tape recorder? It was a present. Is it true? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? I meant to. I kept putting it off, I'm afraid. But why didn't you tell me? I made a promise to your father. Matt, I think we'd better be moving along now. No. No, I don't want to go just yet, Father. Not yet. I'd like to stay here for a bit with you... and get it clearer, if you have no objections. No, I have no objections. Please stay. Matt, I've never ordered you... to do anything in your whole life, have I? But I'm asking you now to come home with me. Will you? All right. Jenny, please... Yes, Matt? I'm going because my father has asked me to... not because I want to. Do you understand? Yes. It's what you must do. Thank you. Could I call you, then, and talk? Yes, of course. Call me tomorrow. All right? Yes. You won't drop it, will you? No. Don't let him wait alone. Please go with him. Anything I can get for you, Jenny? I'll go my way By myself This is the end of romance I'll go my way By myself Love is only a dance I'll try To apply myself And teach my heart how to sing I'll go my way By myself Like a bird on the wing I'll face the unknown I'll build a world Of my own No one knows better Than I myself I'm by myself Alone I'll go my way By myself Here's how the comedy ends I'll have to deny myself Love and laughter And friends Gray clouds in the sky above Have put a blot on my fun I'll try to fly high above I'll try to fly high above For my place In the sun And I'll face The unknown I'll build a world Of my own No one knows better Than I myself No, no one knows better Than I myself How I wanted love and fell Now I say what the hell All of those black days are gone 'Cause it's solo All alone By myself From Now On Did you call New York? - Called New York. - And? - It's a little complicated. - Well, tell me. Can't it wait until after the show? No, it can't, George. Tell me. - All right. You've got a case. - I knew it. I told you. Ida, I've got a case. Jenny, what you've got is a technicality. I'm gonna lay it out for you... just the way the lawyers laid it out for me. The records were searched, and the adoption was legitimate. What did you say? I said the adoption was legitimate, as far as it went. But there's such a thing as second papers. Now, don't ask me what they are. They're second papers, and you never signed them. Thank heaven for me. That means if you want to fight it, you can. Now, no guarantees, a whole long McGill in court. Frankly, darling, it's a long shot. Did you tell them to go ahead? No, I didn't tell them anything just yet. Well, tell them so. George, will you please call the lawyers. Jenny, right now, at this moment... you're on top of a career you've been building for over 20 years. For half that time, I've been with you... so I know a little bit about the subject. I can't stand by and watch you destroy it and yourself. If you fight this case, you might win. It's possible. I don't know. But do you realize what it would mean? You couldn't be in Rome one week, Miami the next. You'd have to stay here in England... and fight it out in the courts. Jenny, the boy's got a home... he's got a father, a school, a way of life. You can't jump into the middle of that... and start making all kinds of waves. George, please. All right. Suppose you got him, what would you do with him? Trail him around the world with a tutor from date to date. Hotel suites, rented cars, other people's houses. And they're pretty strict in England about schools. You might have to send him to a school... and come and visit him now and then at vacation time. Jenny, you'd be strangers, don't you see? All right, all right. What would happen to you? How would you be able to work with this pull all the time? Do you know how to handle a small boy? It's a full-time job. Forgive me, dear... but I don't think you know how to do it. This, all this, this is your job. You do it better than anybody else in the whole world... because you know it. Don't force this, Jenny. Let it rest. George, I know you're trying to help me... but, you see, I love him. And oddly enough, I think he loves me. You have three minutes, Miss Bowman. I'm ready. Matt. I've got to interrupt, I'm afraid. It's all right. Did you mind me taking this? No, not a bit. Have you just got back? I've been finishing some notes. No, don't put it off. It's rather fine. I've spent most of today... wondering how to explain things to you. You've had some pretty rough things flung at you... and now you'd better have the truth. It's up to me to give it to you. - Shall we sit down? - Yes. I don't know how much you heard today... but I presume enough to know that I'm your real father... and Jenny's your mother. Were you and Jenny married once? No, Matt, we were never married. We fell in love while I was in New York studying. I did ask her to marry me, to come home to England. But I hadn't reckoned with one thing... that was her career, which meant more to her than anything else. I couldn't make her change her mind... and I had to come back here to work, so I came alone. That's pretty clear, isn't it? Yes. Then I met Janet again. We'd known each other since we were almost your age. It was always rather expected... that we'd get married, so we did. Then I heard that you were about to be born. Jenny did her best to look after you... but touring the world with a small child... isn't always convenient. So Janet and I talked things over... and it was decided that you come and live with us as our son... our adopted son because that was kinder to Janet. I don't understand why you didn't tell me when Janet died. I didn't expect you to understand entirely. That'll take time, perhaps a long time. But the important thing now is your future. Will you help me? All right. Well, you've promised to telephone Jenny, haven't you? I expect you've been thinking about that. - Yes. - And what you'll say to her. What do you think I should say to her? That's a decision you have to make yourself, Matt. But I can tell you what she'll say to you. She'll ask you to meet her in Paris... and when you get there, it'll be another place... - How do you know? - Because she wants you. But she just said for a few days. It doesn't stop there, Matt. Just because you're angry with Jenny, why should I be? Look, I'm not angry with Jenny. I'm not angry with her. I know her, and I know what I'm talking about. She wants you... not for a weekend, but you. She wants you to leave your friends, your home... and your school, start a new way of life. Matt, I know what fun she's been to be with... and how kind she is and good and wise, too, sometimes. And it would be exciting. You'd see places you'd never seen before... you'd fly, you'd catch boats... and you'd laugh a lot. I know her, Matt. I loved her. I still do love her. But mark this. Jenny gives more love than anyone... but she takes more love than anyone can possibly give. Can you understand that? But what if I do go with her? Well, if it was something you really wanted to do... and it was going to make you happy, I'd get used to it. So you don't really care. Matt, of course I care. If it was up to me... I'd say go and telephone Jenny and say good-bye! Tell her you've got a good life here... and you're not going to muck it up. Matt, you're my son. I love you. I love you. And I want you to go on being my son. Hello? Matt. Hello. How are you? Are you all right? Wake me? No. I've just been sitting here waiting for your call. Where are you? Good. Matt, would you come over right away, please? I've got so much to explain. Everything was so hideous yesterday, especially for you. Please come over right away, darling. Well, what about this afternoon? My day is free. Why? What's happening? Well, why don't you bring your friends along... and you and I can have a private talk... for a little while... and then we can all join forces and have a lovely day? Yes, it sounds a bit complicated. What about tomorrow, Matt? My, you are a busy fellow. Matt, you know that trip to Paris we were planning... the one we talked about? Good. I've been thinking about it, too... and I just don't see how I'm going to be able... to work things out. Yes, that's right. I'll be busy from morning till night... and well, we couldn't be together at all. You might wind up very lonely. I'm glad you understand. Well, of course you're going to be seeing me. I'll be back in London in no time... and we'll have lots of laughs and lots of fun. OK? All right. Well, now, you take care of yourself, you hear? And thank you for being such a fine young man. Bye-bye. Matt... God bless. Ida! Get me my black dress. I'm going out! Wait for me, will you? I hope you don't mind us getting onto you, Mr. Donne... but she was asking for you and wouldn't see anyone else. Where is she? Of course you realize we are trying... to keep this matter completely confidential. Yes, of course I do. Unfortunately, we're full up at the moment... so we had to put her in there. Thank you very much. - Lf there's anything you need... - I'll let you know immediately. Right. Don't ever go to an exhibition... of abstract art for the minions. No, I won't. Thank you, nurse. And if you do go, don't drink the martinis. No. Because they're half gasoline. And you've had enough. I've had enough to float Fire Island. Does it show? Someone told me. That's pretty sneaky. There's a young lord I must warn you about. A young Lord George... Hell, whatever his name was. He asked me if he could take me home, and I said thank you... and we got into a cab. The next thing I knew it was all fall down... and I wound up with this. He knew where he lived, all right... but I was out, I was out cold. I was out. Nobody asked me where I lived. How did you get here? Cab driver named Gerald. Gerald brought me here, and they fixed my foot... and they gave me coffee. And somebody asked for an autograph... for their cousin Marilyn. I feel awful, David. Have some of this. Come on. No more coffee. No, I couldn't take any more coffee. You'd have to feed me through the vein. I'm full. I'm full to the brim with the whole goddamn world! Yes. Well, now look. Come on. Be good. Drink this. Come on. Have you come to take me home? No, I've come to take you to the theater. No, you haven't. I'm not going back there. I'm not going back there ever, ever again. Listen, they are waiting. I don't care if they're fasting. You just give 'em their money back... and tell them to come back next fall. - Jenny, it's a sell-out. - I'm always a sell-out. You promised. They're waiting. - There's George and Ida... - George and Ida... - and 200,000... - nd 200,000. I know that. Just let them wait. To hell with them. I can't be spread so thin. I'm just one person. I don't want to be rolled out like a pastry... so everybody can get a nice big bite of me. I'm just me. I belong to myself. I can do whatever I damn well please with myself... and nobody can ask any questions. You know that is not true, don't you? Well, I'm not gonna do it anymore, and that's final. It's just not worth all the deaths that I have to die... It's just not worth all the deaths that I have to die... You have a show to do tonight. You are going to do it... and I am going to see that you do. Do you think that you can make me sing? Do you think you can... do you think George can make me sing or Ida? You can get me there, sure, but can you make me sing? I sing for myself. I sing when I want to, whenever I want to... just for me. I sing for my own pleasure. Whenever I want. Do you understand that? I do understand that. Just hang onto that, will you? Hang onto it. I've hung on to every bit of rubbish... there is to hang onto in life. And I've thrown all the good bits away. Now, can you tell me why I do that? No, I can't tell you why you do that... but I can tell you this, you are going to be late. I don't care! Darling... I don't give a damn who you let down... but you're not gonna let you down. You haven't called me that... for years. I haven't been able to call you that for years. Now, come here, look. Just look at me, please. Are you listening to me? There's something I haven't been able... to say to you in years, too. David, don't. Don't say it. Because if you said it now... and if you didn't mean it, I think I'd die. I think I'd die. I'll mean it. I love you. Oh, David! David. Darling. Help me. Help me. Help you? Help us. Help us. David. He didn't want to go with me. He didn't want to. He made all kinds of excuses. He didn't want to stay with me. Darling, I know. I know. Help me, please. I want to help you... but I don't know how. Now, look. Come with me now. Come now, Jenny, please. David, you wouldn't cheat me, would you? Darling, I wouldn't cheat you. You wouldn't say you love me if you didn't. I wouldn't say I love you if I didn't. No, I wouldn't, darling. Please tell me again. Please, once more. I'll tell you as often as you want me to. I've always loved you. That's where it ends, isn't it? That's where it ends. We were the right people that met at the wrong moment... with all the right ideals. We were just too strong... ever to give up everything for each other. We just didn't fit. We fitted. The rest didn't. That doesn't make much sense. The loving does. Yes. The loving does. The loving always does. Are you all right now? I'm all right. I think you're gonna have to help me... with my foot, though. Can you manage? Oops. You know... there's an old saying. When you go onstage... apparently, you don't feel any pain at all. When the light hits you, you don't feel anything. It's a stinking lie. Will you stay with me? Yes, I'll stay. How long? Until you can stand on your feet again. David, I don't think... Where is Jenny? Hey, come on, let's go! Oh, no, I've had it. It's an hour past curtain. You'll be 45 minutes getting dressed. Do you think they're gonna wait for you? There are 2,500 people out there... who paid money to see Jenny Bowman... but you're gonna let them down. That may not mean anything to you anymore... but I still have a certain reverence for audiences. They mean a great deal to me. And if they still do mean something to you... I'm gonna find it very difficult to forgive you. And if they don't mean anything to you anymore... then I am genuinely and profoundly... sorry for you, Jenny. There she is! It's about time, too. Where have you been, Jenny? What? Where have you been? I've been having a hell of a time. Thank you very much. What happened to the ankle? I've been skiing or she-ing or both. Do you like my furs? Yeah! Where'd you get 'em? I just shot 'em. I'd like to sing for you... if we can get these things pulled. Can you pull them up? Pull them up. I think everyone's gone to sleep back there. Thank you. "I Could Go On Singing." When a dove is in love With a doll of a dove He is out all night coo-cooing When an owl's on the prowl For a feminine fowl He goes out all night woo-wooing Every bird and bee Has his lunacy In the way he works his dream off But when I feel high Here's the way that I Like to get my kind of steam off Owls hoo hoo Others sigh Doves coo coo Ah, but I I could go on singing Till the cows come home And the rooster starts to crow, crow, crow When I see your eyes I go all out I must vocalize Till you shout Enough already I could go on singing Till the moon turns pink Anything from "Faust" to Ink-a-dink-a-dink Love does funny things When it hits you this way I must keep on singing Like a lark Going strong With my heart on the wings of a song Singing day I Could go on singing Till the cows Come Home And the rooster starts to crow Crow Crow When I see your eyes I go all out I must vocalize Till you shout Enough already I Could go on I could go on singing Till the moon Turns pink Anything from "Faust" to Ink-a-dink-a-dink Love does funny things When it hits you this way I must keep on singing Like a lark Going strong With my heart On the wings of a song Singing Day
