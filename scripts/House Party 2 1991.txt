Tomorrow's my first day of college. I really wish you were here. And, Pop, about that party... You were right to whup my ass. This final exam is truly an extraordinary piece of work. This student has succinctly summarized everything... he's learned here at this university... Nothing! You fucked up! Christopher, you've wasted your mind... and a mind is a terrible thing to waste. Do you know what your punishment is going to be? The Deans... of Discipline! And we're gonna kick your fuckin' ass. Help! No. Me, Play. Are you having a nightmare? You been keeping me up all night. What the hell's wrong? It was for real. I dreamed I was in college. I messed up real bad. See? A nightmare, man. That's your sign. You shouldn't go. Listen. Boy, I'm trying to make you a responsible person. Damn, I'm late. You know something? You'd forget your dick if it wasn't screwed on. I'm sorry. I'm just running late. You know, I'm really gonna miss this place. After Pops died, I didn't know what I was gonna do. You're the most disorganized human being I know. Your folks were great for letting me stay here. Yo, man, you don't gotta go. The way we kicked it at the community center last week... We had the girls screaming. The skins were in. - You want to watch the car? - It was hype, I guess. I don't understand what's going on with this college thing. Who knows who could have been at the center that night? One of those talent scouts... You know, for them producers? We could get paid. Not every successful person went to college. Play, you know I promised Pops. Why you sweatin' me, man? Oh, I gotta go get my picture. I'll get your picture. Just straighten up. You're making me look bad. I couldn't sleep last night. Our first day of college. Can you believe it? I couldn't sleep last night, either. You sure you still want to go? Kid, what are you talking about? This is a whole new world. New people, new experiences. A roommate. She's an upperclassman. I can't wait to meet her. Yeah, new rules. No curfew. You do plan to learn something, don't you? Yeah, I guess. I'm gonna be late for my grandma... and you are gonna be late for the church. I'll see you on campus. Oh, oh, before you go... It's just a little something... a little something I wanted to give you. Let those guys at college know whose girl you are. This is so nice. Thank you. See you later. Ain't you giving me something to let people know I'm your man? We're gonna be late. Come on, let's go. When I was in the house, I was just thinking. What, Play? Is school really worth breaking up a team like we got? What are you talking about? Could you keep your feet on the mat? Oh, sorry. This is a great day for First Corinthians Church. - Amen. - Amen. A great day for this community. But most important, a great day for young Christopher. We are very proud of you. You have suffered the tragic loss of your father... but you have not lost your way. We are proud because you have taken the high road... and not the low road... unlike some of our other youngsters... who shall remain nameless. Today... we are sending one young man... from this fortress of Jesus to a citadel of higher learning. So... In honor of his father Who was loved by this church Christopher Robinson Jr. Why don't you come on up? I want to thank all of you... for making it possible for me to go to college. That was my pop's dream. I know if he were here, he'd be very proud of me... and very grateful to all of you for putting your trust in me. I won't let you down. Sheila, they just rolled in. Yeah, cool. I think everything's gonna just go smooth. What are we doing at your job? I thought you took the day off to drive me to school. A little surprise for my man. What? Not what, who, and if I told your ass... it wouldn't be a surprise, so do me a favor... and come on. Wait a minute. What about my stuff? Kid, it'll be OK. I don't see the junk man coming. Oh, that's real funny, Play. Just 'cause you got a ride named ForPlay... don't mean you gotta start dissing my shit. ForPlay... What kind of name is that for a car, anyway? Just come on. Hold up. My scholarship check. She's the one that discovered The Boyz. - For real? - Word. Her scout was in the house at the community center. She can get us in the studio... even get us a phat record deal. Don't blow this for me, man. Come on. Yeah, my eight o'clock. - Good. Thank you. - Didn't I give you inventory? Get to work. Kid 'N Play. Sheila Landreaux. Rick played me the tape you sent. Rick... That's her talent scout. All the big names have scouts. Remember that. And, frankly, I got very excited. And I've heard a lot of stuff. But that's yesterday's news. Today's headline... is "Kid 'N Play." Gentlemen... I'm willing to make a commitment to you... if you're willing to make a commitment to me. She's ready to commit. Wait a minute. What do you mean by "commit"? I'm willing to commit... in financing and producing your demo... and you... will commit at every waking moment... in taking Kid 'N Play to the top of the charts. Look, I can't do this. Wait a minute. What's going on? Let me talk to him, please. Kid, what do you mean you can't? I can't do this and school. You gonna kick this to the curb for school? With the money we could make, you could buy your own school. Look, you saw all those people in the church. And Pops... I can't let them down. Excuse me. Maybe I could talk to your dad. - Maybe she could talk... - Look, I don't think so. Kid, listen. Sheila, wait a minute. Fuck! Here we are. Oh, yes. Join the Mardi Gras. Come on. What's up with the soldiers? Come on, Kid, man, this ain't your style. Oh, yes, boogie fever. That's a fraternity. Well, maybe that I can get with. What's up with her clothes, man? Look how involved everybody is. Look. Look at all this school spirit. What's up with the pigs? Yo, watch the car. Thanks for helping. Yo, just watch the car. You're just mad about the record deal. No, I'm mad about you fucking up the finish. You gonna get ill, or you gonna help? You wanted to be Joe College... you be Joe College. Yo, G, hold up. I'll be with you in a minute. Yo, what up, black? What's going on, man? Name's Jamal. Why you buggin', man? 'Cause I'm white? Yo, you want some bean pie? Rick, we've run into a serious problem here. We have half of a fabulous team. Unless, uh... Unless that's all we need. I can do the session. I can do it. But it was both of you on the tape. Whoa, wait a minute now. I'm the one who came up with the whole Kid 'N Play idea. I wrote all the lyrics. The only thing that guy ever did was just put his name first. I don't know about this. Sheila, my take on this, Play's on the money. Sounds like he's the driving creative force. Then let's do it. Look, look, look. Let me see this. Isn't it cute? I know you don't think this is what college is all about. No. It was a gift from a friend. Besides, what's wrong with it? Nothing. When I first got here, I had a drawer... full of little boy-toy fru-frus just like that. So, what happened? I grew up. I let my consciousness evolve. And when I left all that male materialism behind... I began to see things in a more politically correct light. You do like boys, don't you? I like men, girl. Thousands of them. No, I'm just kidding. I like men... but I don't need one to define me. And any woman who wants to define herself... by herself and for herself... just has to free herself... of all that tired, lame, male bullshit. Pick a color. Any color. Male bullshit. Excuse me. Bilal's in the house! Hook me up! Hi. My name is Play. I'm the manager here. I couldn't help but notice... that you seem to be looking for something, um... Selena. I'm just browsing. Well, if there's anything in particular you need... anything at all, don't hesitate to come see me. I won't. That was real cute. Now hook me up, man. Bilal, I cannot keep giving you your own personal discount. Play, you ain't looking at the big picture, man. I need these records, 'cause I'm working on some scratches... for our demo session. What do you mean "our" demo session? Let's check out the psychology department. Ooh, this one sounds good. "Social Psychology of Black Awareness. "Psych 222." God, it is so hard to figure out what to do... What are you doing? I'm trying to get a closer look at the catalog. Yeah, right. You're not even paying attention. Am too. Look. "Psych 100. "Human Sexuality." I hope that's not the only thing you're interested in. Of course not. I'm interested in your mind as well as your body. Now, you need to put a check by that, uh... humping and hauling course. That's Hubble and Hawking. Whatever. Check that one. Get off, get off, get off. Stop playing. We have to be serious now. Damn, Play, don't you know shit about the music business? Look, when a MC cuts a record... the DJ is the producer... because the DJ... is the one who made your sorry ass what it is... from the motherfucking giddyap. Now hook me up, thank you. Nice sales pitch. Twenty dollars. Twenty dollars? I thought you was gonna hook me up. Bilal, for fifteen cuts... I should be charging your ass a house note... and would you get from around my counter? I'll bust that ass. I don't think so. Get these boxes out. I'm Mrs. Deevers. I'm here for the job. How you doing, Mrs. Deevers? The job requires a lot of heavy lifting. Oh, it's not for me. It's for my boys. Your boys? Bring your ass in here! Come on in here now! Yo, look! Right now, here. That's that punk Play. Where's Kid? These three rap stars, they got a rap group... and if they could work in your shop here... maybe some big-time producer would give them a break. Oh, they got the tapes. Do that rap thing y'all do at home. Yo, Mama, we ain't auditioning for him. Not this punk. We ain't auditioning for him. I said do the rap! All right. Kick the rap, man. On and on, on, and on, on, and on Like hot butter on... Say what? Popcorn Dibby dibby die, so-socialize Clean out your ears, open up your Eyes Now, well, maybe so I don't think so Well, funky ass Mmm What up with that? That's kind of wack. That didn't even rhyme. Yo, man, y'all be... Excuse me, Mrs. Deevers. I'm sorry, but the job has been filled. Right, Bilal? You got twenty dollars I can borrow? Bilal. I would appreciate it. Thank you. Sorry, guys. The job's all filled, but loved the rap. Don't stand there like a pile of dog shit! Move it, move it! Get on out! Yo, I saved your ass. I should charge you the whole motherfucking store. Thanks for buying these records. Hey, yo, money, if the sister won't cut you no play... you got to assert yourself. What do you know about sisters? I know I like a fat booty. And just 'cause the sister be sweatin' you... about getting positive on the politically correct tip... don't mean that she kickin' the nasty to the curb. - Jamal, do me a favor. - What? Talk white. Will you be paying your registration fees... with cash, check, or credit card? What? Cash, check, or credit card? What? Will you be paying with cash, check, or credit card? My check! ForPlay. What is this? He signed it. It's like cash. Always losing shit. If his dick wasn't screwed on... he'd leave that shit, too. Of course I don't socialize with them. Hey, wait. Tell Father I played four sets of tennis... with Professor Vernault. Give me that phone, you selfish punk. No, it's my phone. You can't have it. My father gave that to me. I'll report you. Selena, right? Play, am I really gonna sing backup on your demo? You can have any damn thing you want. Excuse me. Who is it? Oh, Kid, chill out, man. Don't worry about it. Your scholarship money is as good as in the bank. It's in there. Bye. Hey, yo, Sidney, Zora. Hey, Kid. Hey, Jamal. Hey, what's up? Um, I'm over here. Taking Afro-American Studies: Consciousness of the Sixties. Just imagine, you and I... exploring the roots of blackness together. Kid, I'm not taking it. I couldn't fit it into my schedule this semester. Kind of at the last minute... I decided that I really, really wanted to take... Male Mythology: A Feminist Perspective. Right. Anyway... I hope you enjoy Consciousness of the Sixties. Zora says the professor's really great. Very good. You'll like him. Damn. "Zora says the professor's really great." Zora says take this course. Zora says take three steps forward. Zora says take three steps back. Just because Zora says it, doesn't mean she have to do it. Hey, you got played, yo. The perfect job for my boys. Stop pushing me! Get your butts into that employment office. Get in there! I don't care what your sorry ass... Malcolm X. Everybody knows what Malcolm was about, right? Right. He must have been important. 'Cause you can go into any shopping mall in the country... and buy a T-shirt with his picture on it... right next to the Ninja Turtles T-shirts. But what do we really know about Malcolm? We know he was a Muslim... who made a pilgrimage to Mecca... and returned to America a changed man... with a changed philosophy. Now, if you were printing that philosophy on a T-shirt... what would it say? Mr. Robinson. Malcolm X's philosophy? On a T-shirt? I'm happy you asked me that question. I'll be even happier when you answer it. OK, see, uh... Malcolm X was pro-black... very pro-black. And in his pro-blackness... he believed that the white man... in his pro-whiteness... was not very pro-black. Yo, man, stop bullshittin'. Class... I think Mr. Robinson wants to know... if you can say... white-devils. Why don't we hear from one of these white-devils? Maybe the one sitting next to you... and I know I'm scared of you, Mr... Johnson. Jamal Johnson. Are you familiar with what Malcolm X believed... when he returned from Mecca? Malcolm embraced the brotherhood of all men. Yo, word to the mother. Congratulations, Mr. Johnson. Unlike Mr. Robinson... you obviously did your preclass reading. I won't see you in summer school. Sheila, what's wrong? Get away. Baby, what's wrong? He cleaned me out. Who? Who, baby? Rick, that's who. But what? What happened? He took everything he could get his hands on... for gambling debts. I don't know why I ever trusted him. But, listen, forget about him. Are you going to be OK? Baby, are you going to be OK? Talk to me, woman. Play, I'm so sorry. I can't do the session. I don't have the money... and the worst part is, MCA is waiting for the record. Without it, we're nowhere, Play. Dang. Look, if I get my hand on the motherfucker... I'll pop a cap in his ass. Baby, talk to me. What do you need? Where does he live? I'm your man. Talk to me. Bilal, would you please shut the fuck up? Listen, if I had the cash, I'd front the session myself. Is there anywhere you can get the money from? All we need is to raise the deposit for the studio... and we can still do the session... and my accountant is getting me liquid again. But I'm completely busted. If you hadn't put all your money in that pussy mobile... we wouldn't be in this shit. Play, you don't understand. This is our future at stake. I have a check, but it's made out to Kid. He did sign it, so I guess it's as good as cash. - I'll take it. - Wait. That's perfect. I won't even cash it. Wait, wait. Aw, damn. Kid's check? Yo, Play, that's fucked! The boy needs a education. Yo, Play, that's fucked. Hey, man, you need to get with the program. Buy the books, do the reading... End of problem. You turkey. Hey, take it easy! Hey, guys, I smell something. Do you smell something? I smell pussy! Yo, hold up. This is black men using their power of authority... against another brother. Yo, black, this ain't correct. What's up with that? Yo, who is this man, your girlfriend? Yo, what you want, man? Wait a minute. What are you guys doing here? What are we doing here? What up with that? Motherfucker's in college, and he can't read. This means any time we want to, we can fuck you right up. Yo, and right now, I definitely feel it. Hey, Zilla, you feel it, man? I feel it right now, man. You really feel it? What does he mean? Tell these two motherfuckers what time it is. It's time to kick their fucking ass! Yeah! Come here! Motherfucker. A hundred and twenty-three dollars? For books? Tell me about it. I'm spending so much on books... I won't be able to afford a trip home until spring. So, where's home... Japan? No. Texas. Where's yours, Africa? Stupid, huh? No big thing. Bad check. Bad check. It declined your check. You're going to have to go to the finance office... to straighten it out. Don't worry. It happens all the time. Can I help you? Time waits for no man! They told me down the hall I'd have to see Dean Kramer. Don't let him sweat you, my brother. Maintain. So... Christopher... before I get started, I want you to know... this isn't a racial thing. What isn't a racial thing, sir? The fact that your tuition check bounced. My tuition check bounced? Now, this isn't a black thing. It's a deadbeat thing. I have to take your student I.D. Deadbeat! Deadbeat! Deadbeat! Deadbeat! Deadbeat! Deadbeat! If you don't pay your tuition by the end of the week... I'm going to have to kick you out of here. Stand up, please. Good-bye, Christopher. Have a nice day. Don't forget... Time waits for no man! Peace. Where is my money? Kid, you got to promise me you're not going to ill. Come on, Kid. I'm not going to ill. Sheila has your money. What? I'll tell you what he said. Sheila got your money, man. Kid, you promised you wasn't going to ill on me, man. Look, see? I told him not to do it. I said, "Kid needs his money. "The boy needs an education." But no. I said, yo, when you find out, you going to whup that ass... and that's what you gonna do... Whup that ass. Bilal, shut the fuck up. Whatever. Let me ask you this: Why does Sheila have my money? I'm glad you asked that, Kid. Um, see, your money's safe. Um, Rick... You remember Rick, right? Yeah, well, he was a snake. He stuck her up for the money, and she couldn't do my record. - Your record? - Yeah. Kid, he dissed you, man. Look, whup his ass! Listen, the only ass that's going to get whupped is yours! I don't think so. Oh, you... Um, listen, you wanted to be Joe College, right? And I just needed the check... as a deposit down on the session so that, um... by the time her accountant liquidates all her assets... That's right, liquidates all her assets... that we would get the money back tomorrow at the session... and it'll make sense to you once you know the business. Let me make it make sense! Your money is gone, man! He fucked you and didn't even kiss you! See? Studio, ride. Ride, studio. Yo, no! Yo, I'm telling you, man, ain't no studio in there. No, yo, that shit is gutted out. I'm telling you, it's a fucking front, man. Do Me Records. What can I do for you? Sounds like you could do a lot, but anyway, my name is Play. Uh, yo, and this is the... his producer. Um, Sheila Landreaux, she's expecting me. Sheila who? See, I knew it. Oh, this... Get off me. - Shut up. - What? I'm sorry. Not you. But listen, Sheila Landreaux... and my name is Play, and I'm here to cut a record. Sorry. Never heard of Landreaux or Play... so there's no way Do Me is doing shit for you today. Yo, she fucked you, man... Yo, with your money, Kid. Didn't I tell you when I tried to tell you that in there? Yo, let's just go. I was trying to tell him. So, Play, when are we going to record our record? Your record? I'm here to cut my record. What the fuck are y'all talking about? Who the fuck you talking to like that? Yo, chill, chill. Yo, man, fuck your record... Our record. Sheila Landreaux gave you our money... for our recording session to make our record. You know what I'm saying? Y'all know Sheila? Wait a minute. She said he has your money for your recording session? You damn right. Well, excuse me. Damn. You know, it sounds like she fucked all of youse. What the... Shit, they're taking her car! Halt! Assume the position! Looks like we nailed the purloined Porsche perpetrators. And they're all black. What a surprise! Hands up! I want you victims of crime to remember in the future... not to give money to any beautiful woman... by the name of Sheila Landreaux... a.k.a. Shareese Taylor... a.k.a. Sharnelle Butler... a.k. a... Well, I think you got the idea. You... you and you, this is your lucky day. Beat it! Get out of here. You hurting me, man. Oh, shit. OK, you three guys are going for a ride downtown. What the fuck for? What up with this? Hands down! Car theft, larceny... mail fraud, embezzlement... Damn! I'm going to tell you like this. I hope you ain't getting no pussy... 'cause that shit could be lethal, man. Bilal, would you just do me a favor and shut up? Would you just shut the fuck up? Yo, Play, the bitch has a record longer than my dick. Yo, can I ask you something? Can I ask you something, please? What? You feel real stupid, don't you, huh? When are you gonna learn? And look at this motherfucker. Ass out... No money, no education. This shit got to stop. I'm... How long? Well, at least I'm not the irresponsible one... who left his check around that I'd be tempted by it. You know what I'm saying? You... Chill! Yo, I was... Yo, I was bullshit... Yo, we boys. We boys! Shit. Damn. Yo, you know what I think? Shut the fuck up, Bilal. Yo, it ain't going to be too many more... of them shut-the-fuck-ups. all right? Because I'll whup both of your asses. You should talk to the bank, man. What are you talking about? Your girl Sidney... Her parents, they own minimalls. I'm not asking Sidney for money. Sidney, there's something I got to talk to you about. See... This is really difficult... We been seeing each other for over a year, and... Well... See, well... You want to see other people? Yo, I'm really fine about it. But, wait, I didn't mean... I'm fine about it. I'm fine about it, too. It's so funny. We live closer to each other now than we did at home... and somehow, we see less of each other. Well, you know... you have your classes, and I have mine. You're making new friends, and I guess I am, too. We're at college to have new experiences, right? Why should we tie each other down? I don't want to tie you down if you don't want to be tied down. Good... 'Cause I feel the same way about you, too. It's great that we feel the same way about each other. I guess I'll see you around the campus... buddy. Yeah. See you around campus, pal. Sit down. I need to talk to you. Listen, get your act together. Keep your mind on them books and off them gangs. Hey, what up, man? Damn, what's wrong with you? Damn, man, you look like shit. How could the best day of my life... and the worst day of my life happen in the same week? Yo, I ain't got the science on that, black... but what I do know is... you better deal with Dean Kramer and your financial situation... before that situation deals with you. Better get off your behind. Yo, I gotta get out of here. I'm gonna check you later. Peace. Ah, brother Robinson. I think I can help you out. Come here. Come on, brother. Bottom line... You don't have the snaps... but you want Dean Kramer to give you an extension... till you figure out what your next move is. That's right. Naw, see, that's fucked. If you was a white boy... he'd give you more extensions than a bad weave... but, a brother, he ain't going to play that. So, in other words, I'm over. See, not necessarily. See, my boy works the main computer. Now, cuz could lose your paperwork for a while... and buy you a little time. For a price? Hey, yo... life's a bitch, homey... and not always a fine bitch, either. Hello, Miles. Well, hello yourself, Professor Vernault. Allow me to introduce you to young Christopher Robinson... a most promising freshman. Professor Vernault... is one of our most esteemed scholars, Christopher. Professor... you know, I still find myself... reflecting upon our discussions... of Chaucerian scatology. Then you'll love my upcoming lecture... on the juxtaposition of Thanatos and Eros... in the works of Fielding. Oh, wouldn't miss it, sir. Well, I must be off, Miles. Wow. That was deep. Yo, you want to whup the white man... you got to know how to play the white man's game. - Hook me up. - Wise decision. Now, my boy usually charges the football squad... a couple hundred a head. I don't have that kind of money. Well, what you got, brother? Come on, brother, don't let this pass you by. That's all the money I have in the world. I'll take it. What is... the single most important question... any of us can ask ourselves? Who... am I? Late again. My girl left me. We've been taught that it's OK to define ourselves... in relationship with others as... What you doing, man? ...slave... nanny... athlete, or entertainer... but never on our own terms as individuals. Ralph Ellison brilliantly explored that theme... in "The Invisible Man..." which I can see... that Mr. Robinson... is most anxious to discuss with us. Come on, man, don't... Mr. Robinson! I am? I am. "The Invisible Man"... A great book. A very great book. Here we go again. But I always wondered... why did he call... the invisible man... the invisible man? Everyone is on the edge of their seats. Why? I think the author was trying to say... that black people... are like that movie... where the only way you could see the guy... is if he was... wrapped in white bandages. So Ellison... was saying that... in order for white society to see us... we must be wrapped in white? Yeah. I am. Very insightful, Mr. Robinson. You taught me something. Could I see you after class? You're through. You wanted to see me, sir? What I want to know is... do you have the gift that I think you have... or am I just being charmed by your line of bullshit? Could I get back to you on that? Yes, you can, in a week... with a twenty-page paper... in which you discuss how Ellison, Wright, Baldwin... and the other authors I assigned to you to read... handle the theme of growing up as a black male in America... In a week? Wait a minute. That's not fair. Life is not fair, Mr. Robinson. There are students on this campus who are here... only because their parents are rich alumni. That isn't fair. And those students might look at you... and think that the only reason you're here... is because you're black, and you got a good jump shot... or you're black, so you can run with a football... or you're just here because you're black. That isn't fair. And it might not be fair that you got to prove... that you're here because you've earned it, but you do... and if you don't prove it to me, Mr. Robinson... I'll fail your ass. Yo, you talk to Kid? He hasn't even called me... to find out how I'm feeling after losing my record deal. Play, it was wrong, man. Fifteen dollars. - We hook up later, right? - All right, peace, man. - Peace. - Yo, peace out. Later. What's up with the extra ends? Sometimes you got to pay what you owe, right? Later. You're right. A twenty-page paper to write. All those authors. It ain't gonna be easy. You can't get in without a student I.D. What up with that? Give it up, man. Yo, here's some food. Damn. What, you starving? Thanks, Jamal. No problem, man. You know, without my I. D... I can't get into the library or the cafeteria. Living by my wits isn't easy. It's hard work. Hard work? I haven't seen you do any work yet. You need to get off your butt... and go down to the faculty dining hall. Word. Yo, free food, the pay is correct... but, yo, man, you better make sure you come correct... 'cause to work for Mr. Lee... You got to be all you can be. Move it, move it, move it! Loaded tray. Do you know where Mr. Lee is? Excuse me. Do you... Out of the way, please. Excuse me. Move your ass. Do you know where... Hey. Look out. That's my foot. Heads up. All right, so what's the holdup here? You should've been out of here fifteen minutes ago. Do you know where Mr. Lee is? Who wants to know? You must be the new recruit. You got to go to work, boy. There's a pile of spuds over there with your name on it. Do a good job, boy, and you'll be on your way... to earning your kitchen assistant first-class pin. Yes, sir. You forgot your cap. Everybody got to wear the hat. But it won't fit. I'd look stupid. Are you saying I look stupid? No, no, sir. Actually, it looks kind of good on you. Are you saying I look good... with a damn plastic cap on my head? No, sir. Then what are you saying, boy? I have no idea. Listen, son... you want to stay off my shit list... put on the hat. You look good. If I lose this, my dad will kill me. Do you feel lucky? I'm going for it, man. Let's go, let's go, man. Put your weight on it. Gimme it, man! Give me my money, man. Give me... Thank you! Fuck, man! Thank you, man, thank you! Freak, man, freak! I'm a winner, man! - Who's next? - Me! Scared money don't make no money. What's up, K-l-D? Yo, Kid! Jamal, watch the cash. Kid, wait! Yo, man, whassup? What are you trying to do to me? Trying to raise you some dough. By ripping off these people I have to see every day? OK, we'll kick Monte Carlo night to the curb. I'm forty-five minutes away, and on my days off from work... I can come up and work on a new plan. - Plan? - Yeah. Don't mention plan in my presence. I can't afford any more of your plans. You're gonna get your "A," mm-hmm. You're gonna get your "A." Girl, you're gonna get your "A," you hear me? Oh! Oh, Play! Uh, Kid. Yo, man, I'm thinkin' hard. "If you have no confidence in self... "you are twice-defeated in the race of life. "With confidence, you have won even before you have started. "Marcus Garvey." Professor Sinclair? What can I do for you, Mr. Robinson? My paper, sir. Excuse the coffee stains. I just wanted you to know I worked really hard on it. I quoted from your book... which I must say was really excellent. I'll reserve judgment on your paper, Mr. Robinson... but... as far as your ass-kissing goes... two thumbs up. Why don't you roll the dice? In your ass! Chill, my brother. I ain't your brother. Ain't trying to cause no beef. What are you doing? Come on, why you go and do something stupid like that? Yo, milk, do something about your boy. That's it. If your name isn't Kid or Jamal, get out of my room! Without even hearing my plan? You managed to spare a little time to come up with a plan? Not any plan. The plan of plans, you know? Yo, think about it. A house party. A house party? Yo, not just any house party. The mother of house parties. A pajama jammy jam. Women in negligees... Look at this. Mmm. ...get in free. Brothers have got to pay. All of the proceeds go... to the Christopher Robinson scholarship fund. You, boy. Don't worry about nothin'... 'cause I'm about to take care of everything. Yo, Kid. I'm taking care of everything. Let me get this straight. You want a bunch of college women... to strip to their underwear, come to my room... so you can charge a bunch of horny motherfuckers... to be in there with them? Ladies, six feet. Wait a minute. Slow down, man. Not here. In the faculty dining hall, man. All you gotta do is... get the key? Oh, no. Look, I'm not with it. Forget about it, all right? I'm not with it. Why's he flippin' on us? Kid, Kid, Kid. Boy, what you want? I borrowed this book from Sidney. You can give it back to her. Now, you know that's not Sidney's book. It's not? You're right. It's not. My mistake. Yeah, that is your mistake. Coming around here with that lame "Do me, baby" mentality... is another definite mistake. I'll tell you what the mistake is. The mistake is you think you know everything. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me. Tell Sidney I asked about her, and I hope she's doing OK. Please? What? Look, there's a rally this afternoon. It's against the cutbacks in the ethnic studies program. So if a man were looking for Sidney, he might find her there. Knowledge is power! - What? - Knowledge is power! Come on, sister. Now, if we allow the administration... to cut back on ethnic studies... we will be letting them deny the contributions... of all of our cultures that made this country great. Knowledge is power! Come on, y'all. Clap with me now. Listen here. Everybody wants to be a rebel Well, a rebel without a cause can turn into a devil For a moment just take a pause So we can reach a lever To open up the doors, eliminate the gap You're searching for perfection in somebody else You sacrifice yourself for his illegal wealth Living in the image of a man what you are You're just another Jackie who wants to be a star As far as I'm concerned, I'm getting quite annoyed There was a brain that had nothin', just a void Filled with materialistic thoughts Of cars and dolls, things you just bought Drugs people sold, but I'm gonna rise like a tower Tellin' all the people that it's time to devour you see, the future that we live in is ours Because knowledge, it is power Knowledge is power Check it out, intelligence captivates my mind I'm gonna succeed with my brain and not my behind 'Cause I don't feel that as a black woman I should give up the booty if the boss thinks it's boomin' Or some people who move up on others Like they own 'em and they don't treat 'em equal Can't you see? This is racist, racist, racist Where they chase us Away from knowing who we are and where we came from I ain't stopping until we gots this game on 'Cause I know this is the hour to make knowledge equal power Scream it, scream it Knowledge Is power Thank you. Right now I would like to introduce our next speaker. Professor Sinclair. Thank you, Zora. As I stand here and look at your... Zora, your performance was moving. We need more people like you. I want you to call me. I think we can make you a star. You have the right to learn about your heritage... and the heritage of others. Support ethnic studies. Knowledge is power! What's wrong, Sidney? Uh, nothing really. It's Kid, isn't it? I know he was at the rally. You know him? I met him at the dean's office. He was having some problems. Doesn't look too good. - Really? - Yeah. That's too bad. He was going on about his ex-girlfriend... and how they were breaking up... because she wasn't into "givin' up the rhythm..." as he put it. But the more he said about her, the more I knew... he didn't know what he had... and I had to meet her... because she sounded like such a find. Damn, Miles! Give the child some room to breathe. Zora... what a surprise. I should be going. Can I giv... Can l... Can I give you a call later? Yeah, please. All right. Oh, God. What do you think? He's so different from Kid. He's... he's mature, he's sophisticated... he's an intelligent conversationalist. Yeah. I see you two were about to get into... a heavy conversation in French. Look, Sidney, different doesn't necessarily mean better. Why don't you think about that? Dean Kramer's office called... and they want to see you right away. This is a work study job... for students... and they say you ain't no student! I thought you were supposed to be hooking me up for the black. Yo, brother Robinson, I'm working on it... but delicate situations such as these sometimes take time. Dean Kramer, I was just... Leaving? Thank you, Miles. The deadline I gave you... for paying your tuition has come and gone. And we do have a policy of encouraging our students... be they black or white, to pay their tuition. So, it's with great sadness that I have to tell you... Dean Kramer, please, just give me one more week. I promise I'll have the money. One more week. But if you don't have the money by then... it really will be it! Time waits for no man! Why haven't you called me about the recording session? You promised me I could sing backup. Listen, Selena, don't sweat me! Don't sweat it. As soon as the... Excuse me. If the others don't succeed, I got the twelve-inch you need. Clarence's Records. What up? When's the party? Tell him about the pajama party! I knew about this party, and I don't even go to school! I want y'all to tell me about this party. Everybody know about this party but the three of you. Go out there and find out about this party. Make your grandma proud! We can get you signed in a heartbeat. - Really? - No problem. What are you doing tonight? - There's a pajama party. - We'll be there. I think it's a pajama party. And the rules are very clear on that shit. "No university building or other property... "may be used as a meeting place... "or venue for entertainment... "without the express authorization... "of the dean of the college." Very good, Stab. Now all we need to know is where the party's gonna be at. All right, who was it? I don't think so. Check that out, man. Yo, for a midget white boy, you all right, Jamal... sneakin' in the house with the brothers. Yeah, you all right, even though you try to flex. Can't play dice, though. Will you be quiet? Damn, Kid, calm down. You're getting white as a ghost, and that's hard for you to do. Now, come on. All right, all right. Come on, come on, come on. I just want to remind everybody. Let's be careful in there, OK? Would you relax? Careful! Y'all want to help me with my equipment, please? Thank you. Yo, I swear if I gotta carry this shit in by myself... I'll play the Village People all fuckin' night. Yo, man, chill. Don't go out like that. Who are you supposed to be, Mrs. Kunta Kinte? I thought this outfit was politically correct. You know, P.C. Well, it is P.C. if it stands for "poor choice." Girl, why are you looking like me instead of you? I don't know what I'm supposed to look like anymore. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel like anymore. I miss Kid, but he needs to grow up. That's what you said, right? Now, don't go blaming breaking up with Kid on me. You're the one always talking about... how immature he is with his "Do me" attitude. But it's not about what I think. It's about what you think. What's in your head and your heart. That's what being a strong woman is all about, Sidney. This is Zora going to the party. I hope I see Sidney there. All the girls kept talking about... was silk teddies and sexy nightgowns. All clear! Let's go! - All right! - Let's see some panties, boy! Girl, hurry your fat ass up! Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo I'm never, never, ever gonna let you go Brothers are ten each... women appropriately dressed... or should I say undressed... get in free. She crept into my heart At a funky time I met her once or twice I knew something was right I was hoping Sidney would be here. Have you ever known Sidney to miss a good party, man? She's gonna be here, man. If you see her, just let me know, OK? I will, but go in there and try and hit some skins. Pretty black hair and big brown eyes Made my mouth so dry Should you be with her Excuse me. I don't know Pardon me. I tried to tell Yo, B, you got some cuties here.

Yo, you ain't gotta... Yes, I do. We both do. You seen Kid? Last time I saw him, he was lookin' for you. - Really? - You got an eye problem? - Come on! - Fool. Live all my days If one could She had all the right things Then she touched the right places Now I'm in her world And I'm so confused No place for me - Yo, yo, Play, man. - What? What's up?

I am a very patient man... but I want somebody to tell me, what is going on here? I'll tell you what's going on. She stole my boy's money. Oh, so that's where your tuition money went. - Got it. - That's right. And he stole his money, too... and hurt his girl. Listen, it'll all make more sense... if, you know, you knew the business. - It's close enough. - And Sheila Landreaux... Sheila Landreaux? - A.k.a. Shareese Taylor? - A.k.a. Sharnelle Butler? - That ho again? - Well done, gentlemen. Let these men go. And I am very concerned that your treatment of my officers... indicates a deep-seated hostility... toward black men in positions of authority. But, sir, I'm a black man. Then act like one. These men have performed duties... above and beyond the call of duty... and they will be rewarded for it. Rewarded? Hey, fellas, that means we get our stripes. Young man, you have a bright future at this university. Miles, your future is behind you. You're out of here. Take him! But, Dean Kramer, it's a complete fabrication. It's a miscarriage of justice. I ain't goin' out like that. Get 'em out of here. As for the rest of you, fair warning... Time waits for no man. You have fifty-nine minutes and thirty-two seconds... to put this building back in its original shape... or you face expulsion. Have you got that? Peace. Will you look at this place? And I thought they fucked my place up. - What am I gonna tell Mr. Lee? - It's OK, man. I don't know, but it better be real good. I'm out. That's your ass! Mr. Lee... Mr. Lee, my ass. I got three telephone calls, including Dean Kramer... asking if I gave authorization to use this hall. Now, now, uh, Mr. Lee, right? Check this out, I know it looks bad... but it was for a good cause, my brother. See, we had to borrow the place to raise money for my man. Play, thanks, but no excuses. Give me the money. What, the ends for school? Are you crazy? Play, no excuses. Give me the money. I have to do this by myself. Oh, and you expect me to stand around and watch this, right? l... I can't do it. Illegal party, half-naked women... What kind of way is that to handle a money problem? How come you didn't come to talk to me? I'm sorry I disappointed you, Mr. Lee. Hey, I don't want your money. I want to kick your ass. I know, but take this. And if it's not enough to cover all the damages... I'll do whatever it takes for as long as it takes... to make things right. Sorry, Pop. It's all right, Kid. No, man. Hello, Play, what's up? What are you doing here? I had a feeling you'd be up here... so I figured I'd come up here and give you a lift back. Thanks... but if you don't mind, I'd rather be alone. Got a couple of cuties waiting in the car, man. Remember the ones in the pink negligee... You know, I'm really gonna miss you. Come on, now. You know I'm gonna be up here every weekend looking after you. Kid, I'm your boy. You know I'm gonna take care of your girl while you're gone. Don't worry about it. You just keep those nasty-ass dreads off my woman, all right? Yo, guys, I got to get this stuff downstairs. Play's already an hour late. That means I got another 15 minutes before he gets here. That Kid be on some serious C.P.T. Wait. Hold up. There's some people I got to see before I go. How you doin', son? Not so good. Things didn't work out, so... I'm gonna be leavin' school. Just remember what I told you. Sometimes you got to do what you don't want to do... in order to get where you want to be. Remember, if you ever need anything... I'm here for you. Thanks a lot, Mr. Lee. I'll be back. I'll save a plastic cap for you... with your name on it. Professor Sinclair? Sir? I was wondering if you had a minute. Missed you in class today. I missed being in it. I guess that's something I have to get used to. I have to drop out of school. Money problems. You quitting, Mr. Robinson? Well, I guess I just haven't proved I belong here... at least not now. I thought that the student who wrote this paper... did prove that he belonged here. "A-"? I had to take off for the coffee stain. Chris... you are a talented writer... and you have earned a place in this school. I have? If I got you a job as my student assistant... could you get by? It just wouldn't cover all my expenses. But, hey, it's no big deal. I'll get a job, save my money. I'll be back. A lot of brothers and sisters say that... and never come back. Make sure that you do. Check out our new car. We got our stripes! I'll be right back. - Y'all don't be long now. - OK, baby. All right. - What's up? - Where's ForPlay? Yo, man, it's my fault you had to drop out of school... and we can't have that. Here. I'm sorry, man. You said the "S" word. What do you want, a fucking bullhorn or something? I can't believe it. You sold ForPlay? Sometimes you got to pay what you owe, man. l... I can't believe it, man. I don't know what to say. Yo, man, just let your grades do your talking, man. That's all I want. Play, we're going to be late for our centerfold shoot. I'm the photographer. Hurry up! Wait a minute. You're gonna need an assistant. Let me put my things away, and I'll get right with you, OK? Whoa, wait a minute, man, no. What I need you to do is go upstairs... study your ass off... 'cause I'm coming back periodically... and I'm gonna check the professors... and make sure you're doing good, man. Don't let me down. You're an investment now. I'm out of here, five thousand on this thing. Come on, girls, let's go. Come on, Bilal. Bilal, did I mention to you the guy who bought ForPlay... has a brother who's in the record business? Thanks, Pops. Hey, what's up? You stayin'? Yo, I got the dough, man. - Word? - Yeah! You in there, money! "Know from whence you came." "If you know whence you came..." "there is really no limit to where you can go." James Baldwin. Not "F"! "F-"! Atten-hut! About face! Papa say... Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Slide! We are proud because you have taken the high road... and not the low road. Unlike some of our other youngsters... who shall remain nameless. Now break it on down. Mr... Robinson. Oh, damn, Kid. I'm thinkin' like a motherfucker, man. Oh, you gonna get an "A" today, girl. Fever! Fever! Fever! I'll get you, motherfuckers! Brothers, atten-hut! What? Hey, man, do you hear any music? No. What up with that? Yo, and there ain't nobody here dancin'. Aw, shit, and I wanna shake my ass.
