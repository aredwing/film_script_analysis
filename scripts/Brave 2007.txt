Now the country's financial system must be in a wild ride. Why am I laughing? We are in that shit too. Oh shit. Approximately 20 minutes after the robbery, there was a report that the thief has used the data of almost before the cards were deactivated, causing innumerable damage. Shit. My card must be used too. Bee... Bee... Bee, come here. What's the matter, bro? My credit card was used, man. This caused Mr.Somboon Atchariyavanich, company's CEO in Thailand, to be fired by the mother company to show responsibility for this event. - This man's face was captured by a CCTV - Shit! I'm dead! and police is trying to bring him to justice. The robber really look familiar, don't you think? That's not just similar. That's you. It's really necessary, bro. Necessary my ass. I just got them data. Who are they? I don't know. Don't know. You think I'm a fool? Get out of hear. - I'm not helping you. - All that I have done is for you, you know. What did you say, Bee? It's to trade with your life. Really? That's so touching. But that caused troubles to you and others, you idiot. You have to flee now. The cop will be here any minute. Yes. Hello officers. That's it. There they are. Yes. Salute! We are about to turn ourselves in. Bee, why are you standing there? Get them some water, quick. Hey, Stop! Where are you guys going? Do we have to tell them bro? Then go! So, What's next? That way, through back door. Go! Hurry up! Why is it so loud? Hey! They are there. Bee, I'll go that way. Go! Go! Go! Hey! They go this way. Bee. This way. Gosh! Damn! So tired!

Get him! Don't! Don't! Damn it! I'll get him! Look after it. Catch him. You guys don't... I'll take care of him myself. You guys don't, Let me... I'm in deep shit now. Hey Mai... How come you are here? Oh Mai... You I'm your friend mate. I don't call a murderer as a friend... you killed someone... you were in jail and left my sister alone... did you have any idea what she has been through? You mean "Maew"? Her name is "Hmeaw", you asshole. Man why is it so hard to remember? Damn... Mai... don't shoot... Don't... Bee! Lita, Does meditation make you feel better? Yes. Is there something wrong? The clients's data might have be stolen before that. We are facing billions of non-performing loan. It's not your fault. But you are fired because of me. The company lose reputation but I don't lose you. That huge amount of money will be my responsibility. Do you have a way out? We have to be strong. I love you. Get some rest. We are bankrupt, right? Right? I can't accept that. I can't... Honey!... Honey!... No... No! Where are you going? Back to Malaysia. Are you going to ditch me? It's you who ditched me first. That voice is familiar. Hey! Bee, you're still alive. Bro, can you read Thai? Even I can't, but I can see the picture. Look at this woman. Bro! That's her. Uh, Her husband died because of you! Now she's a widow. Are you happy? What do you think about Lita? Lovely and beautiful. What the heck are you doing here? I don't understand you at all. Do you think she will read your apologized note? So, you want me to kneel down and beg her forgiveness? She will call the police to drag us to jail then. Hmm! The situation is insecure. We can just send a letter then. Yeah. Go Ahead. Calm down, bro. I have the amulet. No need to be fear of the corpses. You are fearless. You get in first. Why the heck are you pushing? It's a mess. Bro, don't go God, are you with me? What... Wooh bro! There's something fishy here. Something is definitely wrong. What the hell are you doing? Still in the mood to watch TV in this situation? Bro Com here. Check this out. These people look familiar... Mai! Mai? Mai, Who's Mai? Come here man, You don't know him. Hey Bee... why the heck did you get me here? I want you to meet someone. Bro. You wait here... I'll go in and check it out. - What the hell man? - Whatever just wait here. I'll be right back. You've been lost for ages! I always miss you. I miss you too. Do you have any idea what happened to me... while you were in jail for the past 3-4 years? It's all my fault. I was just insane. Can we forget the past and start our lives again? And will you despise me? How can I despise you "Maew"? Hmeaw! Hi Hey whose kids are these Hmeaw? It's none of your business. Hey if you're naughty again, Mommy will beat you real hard time. Whose kids, Hmeaw? They're mine. Who's here Hmeaw? It's me, Mai. Mai, stop running away. Bro. Catch him. - Now what?

What a vigorously defends. What problem do you have with me? Why do I have to do evil things for you? You're competance but unfortunate. My boss put you in jail. Later I just changed my mind. I just wanna see die out here. You risked your life for the useless data which I had gotten it before that. So they used you to convince the police... that you were the robber. And it's broadcasted, for Christ sake. Very smart. But infact, you are just an idiot. Bee, you sacrifice yourself to help me. I love you. You son of a bitch. Whoa, now the truth is revealed, get ready to go to hell. Help me... help me... Before I die let me free this woman, bro. Wanna safe that bitch? Take this bullet first. Spare him. I will kill him myself. Hey John, take this girl to my room. - What are these drops? - Brother. What's the matter? I just wanna say that... Do you know why I didn't go back to Malaysia? You can't find a new wife, right? I promised your sister to take care of you... until you are well on your own. I can't let you die. I really wanna tell you something. Really? What? What the hell is this salty fluid? Now... I know you are touched. No! - What? - I wanna pee. Bee! Can't bear it anymore. That's my head, you jerk! Not a toilet. Stop it! Get me out of here! This bastard pees on my head. Fucking smelly! Get the knife. Fast. You are awake? Familiar with this place? Those 2 guys are here to help you. What will they do when they know the truth? You get everything you want from me. What else, now? A widow who just lost her beloved husband? Beloved? You might need some pleasure to fulfil your need, am I right? I shouldn't have known you. She's got an offer. An interesting proposal. I have a big job offered only for those who are daring. We are, but what about the pay? Countless. All I know is that you can't spend it all in this life. How many men you have? Sorry. I need the one who has at least 500 men. Well 300 should be OK! I said I need at least 500 men. Is that clear? I have almost 1000. Is that enough? Nice to work with you. Do you want the whole country to know you're behind the data theft of your own husband's company. Do you want them to know that you want your husband to die this way? I want to die. Why do you bring this up? He's dead. Your story is so interesting. From an innocent university student... became a whore to pay off parents' debt until they died of broken heart. Over 10 years of living with the hatred, you were determined to have a revenge, on him. And you did it. I hire you to work for me only. Not to dig into my past. Your motive is so interesting. Are you gonna blackmail me? Bee watch out. That's way. Hey, that's the way out. How could I possibly climb up that high? Are you nuts? Wimp! You chicken! You chicken! Hey! Hurry up... Damn it! How can l? Quick. Quick. Up to you! This is the charm of intelligent women. They understand things quickly. Go ahead. If I am caught, you'll be next. When I told you I have 1000 men. How many police are in that number, you know? Bee... Bee. I'm here now. I thing you don't com. Look at that! Oh! They are umm... You want me to peep? Moron! Help her! Bro! Bro Are you OK? Now, what? Anyway we're here now, Let's fight! Bro watch out. Bastard, That's really a wrong timing. I'm just about to be... Grrr... Bro. Look out! This way. Quick! Kill him. Bro. Watch yourself! Ok? Bee, Bee, we defeated them. Die hard huh! Get up! Quick! Quick! Hurry up. Don't shoot. Go! Go! Don't. You guys are just looking for fucking troubles. But this time. I'm not letting you go. Wait.. don't shoot... Let go of my bro and he'll live. That's your most loyalty man. Yeah he is. Usually Bee would knock him to dead this guy is still lucky it seems. I'd say that it's his fucking unlucky. What do you have to negotiate with me now? It's your turn now... The impact of credit card data theft ripples through financial system as a whole when people cancel every brand of credit card, out of security reason. This caused Mr.Prasert Sinthuwat, a CEO of major credit card company, to avoid the problem by jumping from 40 storey building to his death. Thanks for helping me. Have some coffee. What did you put in? Nice scent. It's honey. Thank you, for not pressing charges on us. I'm sorry for the loss of your husband, and for the bad thing I did to you. I think you are quite brave. It's the bravery within you as well as in me. You are brave about what? Have you seen the effects of stealing the credit card information? I'm just brave enough to enter into the underworld to find a dare devil like you to be my puppet. Are you sure he's crazy enough to take on this job and you can whack him easily afterward? And your plan? He'd get my instruction through the phone. Don't worry. I have a voice adaptor. Your target is... Wealthy Bank credit card company on 17th floor. You go to the company's board. The woman on the second row from the top is your target. Don't be stupid. Enter that room now. What the fuck is in that coffee? It's so smelly. Good thing it smells so bad. You are such a liar. Honey? You do have a good nose. No more of being trapped by the coffee again. You sure have no gratitude for the help, bitch. Well I know how you feel, but another revenge would lead us no where. You just get out of here Stop it Bee. Why are you following her? Look what she's done to me. How can I forgive her? - Let me go bro just leave me. - Calm down, Bee. Easy. You get out of my way. - Listen to me. Bee. - Her life is ruined enough. I think she's realized of what she'd done. Believe me... If she did, then she wouldn't want to kill the one, who risked his life saving her. If you kill her, you will end up in jail again. Just stop it, believe me. Forgiving is the source of happiness. Believe me. Come on let's go Bro. Come on sweetie.
