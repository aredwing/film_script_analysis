While I sit at home, waiting-- While you sit at home? While you sit at home, you could be out with me! You could be out havin' dinner with me, dancin'! I want you with me, Helen! I don't swim in hotel fountains! I keep giving you chances, George!!! chances to be a husband, to at least be a father! Father? I love my little girl! You're my family! Yes!

Miller Huggins fines Babe Ruth $5,000 for misconduct... and the Sultan of Swat is suspended for two weeks. Strike three, you're out! Bambino strikes out for the third time today! Babe has not reached base in his last 20 at bats. Good try, Babe! Up your ass, kid! Here's your bicarb, Babe! Hey, thanks, Eddie! He's got no arm, no arm. - Pitch it in there! - Go,Jimmy! There you go! Good boy, Lou. Atta boy! Boy got lucky with that one! Sweet Lou, sweet Lou. He got lucky! That's the seventh home run for young Lou Gehrig!!! who thus far leads the Yanks in round-trippers! The Bambino's customaryjaunts around the base paths... have become a rarity this summer. Aplummeting batting average and lack of run production plagues the Babe. And Colonel Ruppert's Sultan of Sulk... has so far amassed more suspensions than he has home runs. The crowds of Yankee Stadium... do not deal with their disappointment for long... and Babe's most trusted fans turn. You're all washed up, you bum! Go sit down! Strike two! Strike two for the Bambino. And here in the House That Ruth Built... the fans are letting him hear it! Hey,you bum! Babe's been in a long slump! He's collected a record five suspensions already this season! No batter, no batter. Time! What is he doin'? What are you doin'? What's it look like? Wait, folks. He's taken a right-hander's stance. He's going to take a try at hitting right-handed! He's battin' right! Stay at first! - Get back on first! - No, don't run it out! Out! You big bum! Why don't you go back to where you came from!!! you stupid bastard! It's safe! Safe! You're out! - Ow! - You crazy-- You're outta this ball game! Kiss my Dutch ass! Goddamn it! You fat bastard! You are washed up! You're finished, you big, dumb, stupid-- I'll have you thrown out of this park, you bum! Shut your trap! You're yellow! You're yellow! Get off of there! Get off!! Come on, I'll take ya, everyone of ya! You're yella, all of ya! You're yellow! You're all alike! You're yellow! You're yellow, everyone of ya! You're all yellow! You're all yellow! Leave him alone! - You're a bum! - Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Jidge! Jidge! Jidge, you there? Satan finds work for idle hands. Satan finds work for idle hands. Satan finds work for idle hands. Satan finds work for idle hands. Satan finds work for idle hands! Who is it? It's your buddies, Jidge!!! just your buddies! There! I'll take care of him, Jump! Come on, sit up! I heard her say it! Say what, baby? She said, ""I hate you!'' She never loved me! She told me! Helen? No, Matka! My mother! The House That Ruth Built! Banana oil! Everybody pulled out on me today, even the kids! How come you didn't? We're pals, aren't we? They called me a bum!!! little kids, about seven! What the hell's happened, Clara? You got two speeds, Babe! Fast and stop! You're takin' in everything!!! like you're afraid it's gonna go away; like some kid in a candy store eatin' as much as he can before he gets caught! Maybe I'm not one to talk, but!!! you gotta slow down! I missed ya, Clara! I missed ya! I've missed you too, Bambino! Babe Ruth, the Bam... the Bambino, the Maharajah of Mash... gets married in New York to former Ziegfeld Folly, Claire Meritt Hodgson. The foundering legend pledges to SenatorJimmy Walker... "I won't touch a drink until October!'" Ruth returns to the deserted Home Plate Farm. Bust 'em Babe sheds 20 pounds. This scribe comes up and asks me about the psychology ofhittin'. I says, ""What's psychology got to do with hittin'?'' Hey, the gym's down here! I know! We gotta stop at Macy's first! Underwear people asked me to endorse their stuff! We gotta stand by the undies for a couple hours, shake hands! How much they payin' ya? I told them fifty bucks an hour! Seemed like a good fella! Fifty bucks! Tell him a grand an hour or forget it! They're usin' ya, hon! A grand an hour? Yeah! Another thing, these candy bar people!!! they can't get away naming a chocolate bar ""Baby Ruth''!!! and saying they've named it after the president's daughter! They're takin' money out of your pocket, the bums! Good candy bar too! You can't let these sharks eat you up! You gotta make your money now! What do you mean, ""Make my money now''? When baseball's gotten what they can from you-- Baseball's never gonna get all they can 'cause I'm gonna be the manager! I know that, but-- You've been readin' the papers!!! all this crap about me being washed up! I didn't say that! I went down to the farm and busted the belly off me! Yes, you did! And how! That was up there with the hicks in the sticks! As soon as you come back!!! you join up with the night boys and drink like a duck! As long as you do that, you're gonna be carvin' air!!! watchin' ""Iron Man'' break your record! Whoa, wait a minute here! Wait a minute, sister! Iron Man, is that what you're calling this Gallagher boy? His name is Gehrig and I didn't come up with the nickname! He's hit 14 home runs! Thirteen! He hit one into the right field stands Tuesday against Cleveland! You were late for that game! What's he doin' hittin' into the right field stands? He's disciplined! He's a workhorse! He's a mama's boy! His mother comes to all the games! He hugs and kisses on her for hours! He's got 14 home runs! You have zip! Slambino... has just hit his second long ""Tater'' today! Twenty-three for the big fellow! Go on! That's the way, Babe! Twenty-three, Garrison! The name's Gehrig! Get ready for number thirty! Stay out of the right field stands! Hear, mama's boy? You wanna hit one, shoot for center or left! Right field's the Babe's! The veteran Ruth has just given the Iron Horse a pep talk!!! some encouraging words from hard-wrought experience! Way to go, Babe! Whoa, what a shot! You're the best! Gehrig belts one long and deep. She's gone, gone, gone into the right field stands. Thirty Homers for Iron Man! That does it, Gehrig! You better grab your mama's hand, Iron Man! We're goin' to war! We're goin' to war! The Yankees hold on to first place... as the Iron Horse, Lou Gehrig... hits his 45th home run. Babe Ruth hits his 45th home run. Forty-five for Ruth, and, oh boy, lookee here... the home run twins arejoined at the hip. But not for long. As the season draws to a close... the Bambino's bat explodes... breaking his own major league record for home runs in a single season. Babe cracks number 60, 60 home runs! Gehrig finishes with 47. Look at you, Mr! Ruth! You're the picture of sartorial elegance! It's enough to drive a girl bananas! What say we, uh, leave this joint!!! and fill a bathtub full of ginger ale? Not 'til the season's over! Hiya, Colonel, you look like a jillion! You look fine, Ruth, Mrs! Ruth! Colonel! When I'm manager, I gotta dress like this all the time! Banquets, you know!

Let's go, Charley! Strike two! We own ya, Ruth! We own ya, boy! You big balloon! This is the World Series! What is he doing? Come on, Ruth, swing at that ball! He called his shot! He ain't human, he's an animal! Nope! He's a god! Clara and me went up to the Hawaiian guy, see-- He was Filipino! We were in the Philippines! Right, right! We go up and ask where we can get a good game of golf! He sends us over to these other Hawaiian guys-- Filipinos! What difference does it make? Make 'em Eskimos! Just a minute please. It's time forJack Armstrong! Could you turn the set up? Uncle Babe, it's for you! See, what'd I tell ya! It's the colonel! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Let me pull your finger! Not now, honey! There's ladies present! Cheater! You cheat! I'm runnin' out of gas, Toots! Hello? He just sits waiting for them to call and tell him he's manager! He's gonna be the best. I wish I was young enough to play third base for him. Helen! The woman who had been living as the common-law wife... of Dr. Edward Kinder... died in a fire at his Watertown home just after midnight. She has been identified as Helen Woodford Ruth... the ex-wife of baseball great, Babe Ruth. Strike three! It's all right, Big Bam. The day's young. Put one out in the right field stands, will ya, Dutchman? I love ya, Babe! Ball! There she goes! Lou Gehrig has just slugged number 49 for the season! He's more than doubled Babe Ruth so far. We've talked about it through the years, Colonel!!! and now I know you have to make a decision! I know you promised me, but!!! I want to know official! Ruth, how can you manage a team!!! when you can't even manage yourself? I've changed a lot, Colonel! Yes, you have! I don't see no more home runs! I got a wife! I'm raisin' two daughters!

Just give me a try, that's all! Very well, Ruth! I'll send you down to Newark! You can manage there. Newark? That's minor leagues! I'm not goin' down to the bushes! That's your choice, Ruth! Anything else? I'm late for a meeting. Well, yeah! If I can't have a shot at managin', I want my release! Okay, you are released! Wait! Mrs! Ruth, I didn't know we had an appointment! I will call you back in one moment! - Colonel! - I offered him Newark! Newark! With respect, Colonel, you don't offer a captain a waiter's job! How can you just throw him away like that? Look!!! I will not tolerate the lip of that overgrown child! I shall be damned if I will accept it from a woman! Your intrusion is not appreciated!!! your approach is not acceptable!!! and our conversation is finished! Good-bye! Ooh! That stadium down the street is the House That Ruth Built, Buster! When the Black Sox threw the series, baseball almost went under!!! but that overgrown child kept the people coming! He saved baseball! And you and every player in a uniform!!! should line up and kiss his ass! Shame on you! No, shame on you! After applying across both leagues... Babe Ruth is signed by the last-place Boston Braves. The one-time Sultan of Swat... is now player, assistant manager and vice president... of the struggling club. The man, who a few years ago was making more money than the president of the United States... has taken a $ 125,000 pay cut. What do you want to stay in it for? To be vice president on paper? To have some silly taxi pick you up at first and take you to second? That was just a stunt! The whole thing's a stunt! No, it ain't! These sharks don't give a shit about you! They're humiliating you! I don't wanna talk about them no more! I'm talking about dignity! So am I, goddamn it! Then get out while you have a shred of it left! I love the game! The game doesn't love you anymore! Roll it to me! He can't hit it! It's through! Second base, second base! Oh-to-two. Let's go, it's okay. Get your peanuts! Red hot peanuts! Thank you! Thanks! I seen your daddy play!!! when he used to knock home runs outta the park left and right! But he never knocked one outta this outfield! No one's ever knocked one outta here! Come on, honey. Come on, Bobby baby. What do ya say now? What do you say? What are you doin'? I'm tryin' to get our man over to second! That catcher's got an arm like a cannon and his eye on our man! He'll throw him out! I know what I'm doin'! I've got 21 years that says if our man steals, he's pegged! Safe! I got a piece of paper that says I'm the manager! Why don't you sit down and let me run my team? I got paper that says I'm assistant manager!!! and next year I got a shot at bein' manager!!! so take your paper, roll it up tight, and shove it up your ass! I think it's time you had a talk with Mr! Fuchs! I'll go see Mr! Fuchs right now! - Strike! - You're out! He's out to pasture. He dropped two balls in the outfield already. He's good gate! He can't hit anymore, but he draws a crowd! He's a circus act, a sideshow! He can't even run his own bases anymore! What the hell can I say? Keep him on!!! let him think he's going to manage. We need attendance. We need gate. Ruth, you're up! Get your ass up there. Let's go, let's go. Come on, Babe! You can do it. Left field, Babe. You're supposed to be a runner, not a walker! Come on, dad! Babe Ruth is up. The old legend's looking heavy and slow out there in the outfield! On the mound, Guy Bush! Tough when you can't run the bases for yourself no more! Ain't that right, old man? Why don't you retire? You're embarrassing yourself. I wanna knock this down your throat!!! so you'll stop sucking on your mother's tit! Watch that language! That ain't language! That's information! That's privileged information! So consider yourself privileged and just call the game! Let's play ball! Get a wheelchair, Ruth. Let's play ball. Strike him out! Strike! I seen him when he used to knock 'em to kingdom come! Babe, you're bleedin'! You're spittin' blood! Maybe you should-- Go sit down! Let's go, Babe. No way, Babe. No way. Let's go. It looks like a play on the mythical called shot!!! against Bush's Cubs of'32! What's all the booing? He's goofy! Hmph! Open your eyes next time! Babe Ruth has hit one over the wall! Folks, no one-- no one has ever hit the ball out of Forbes Field! Oh, my goodness! No way! Let's hold them right there. Boston's sixth and Babe Ruth is up! The Pittsburgh fans are giving him a hard time. Come on, lazybones! Go home. Go back to New York. Go back! Things are getting tense here in the eighth inning... as Babe Ruth takes up the bat! He has stunned this Pittsburgh crowd by hitting two homers today!!! and he has put the first balls ever out of this massive park! Go sit down! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Mr! Ruth? Mr! Ruth? I want to give you this! I'm Johnny Sylvester! You came to see me in the hospital years ago when I was sick! You hit two home runs for me! You gave me this ball! It's worked a lot of magic for me!!! and I just want to give it back to you now! Thank you! I'm gone,Johnny! I'm gone! You're the best! You're the best there's ever been!
