And like most people during the Depression, I now lived each day as it came, no longer expecting anything. Waiting -- for nothing. And then... Hello? Yes. What?? Sh-sh!! Be quiet. Sinus? Somebody die? No. No one Mom... Good Morning Miss Dayse. I wasnt the first relative his Mother called that day. Maybe not even the tenth. But I was around. His Mother said he needed someone to take his mind off his work. Why she thought I could do that, I had no idea. I suppose hes related to half of everybody up here. Were fifth -- or sixth cousins. Depends on how you count... Cigarette? No. No, I dont. I figured Id spend the afternoon there, and after having thoroughly bored him to death, go back to my quiet life. taking care of my act But was not what happened He's not been feeling well. Sinuses. Seems to happen every time, the second he comes home. Mr. President? Daisy. What a rare treat. I hope my mother didn't force this on you. She said everyone else was away. Did she? She shouldnt have said that. How nice to see you. How long has it been? Oh, years. The Dows wedding, sir. In Rhinebeck? Oh, were you there? Where would you like me to sit? Theres tea... I think theres still tea. Will you..? I can do this because my mother's not here. She doesnt believe in sinus medicine... Do you collect stamps, Daisy? I - don't. Come and look at these... I suppose youve met pretty much everyone of these... Not every one. Not yet. Excuse me, I should have knocked. I actually wrote this? My cross, Daisy, is that I am too nice. But -- we need the Senators vote. Dont we? Why cant politicians just be honest? My cousin. Those are from Africa. They say that's the highest waterfall in the world. Would you like me to go? No. Please. I wouldnt. This ones pretty. Id like to go there. Where is that? Well. To be honest, Id like to go almost anywhere. In Europe there would certainly be another war, one we would be dragged into, whether we liked it or not. Here at home, the country is still in a depression people out of work Hungry needing help the President spent an awful lot of time that spring in Hyde Park On Hudson. Fellows, one of you please tell Mother -- that this is radio? He said -- I helped him forget --. -- the weight of world. thirty seconds look at me... I think that means you, Mother. His Mother said hed run the whole country from here if he could. But he couldnt. Not with how things were -- Everyone knew someone who couldn't find a job the first duty of government Everyone scared. is to protect the economic welfare of all the people and in all groups... I said... if private enterprises does not provide jobs this spring government will take up the flag we have all learned the lesson that government cannot afford to wait until it is lost the power to act. therefore I've sent a message of reaching a prop to the congress And everyone looking to him. They all wanted something from him. The local labor union, the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, the German-American Friendship Band. And all he wanted -- was to relax. Each time he came home, hed telephone and ask: Daisy where would you like to go today? And I would always answer -- anywhere. His wife, he said, didnt like to take drives. I learned the names of birds and trees Id seen my whole life. We drove along country roads, up hills, through woods, through fields. we drove down roads I never knew the existence. Roads later... I couldn't find by my own. Hed had the car built so it could be driven with just the hands. In some ways it's smoother than the regular car Do you like to drive? I believe I helped him to forget the world As we just run away And then, one day... Wheres the police car going? Oh, they don't follow all the time. Sometimes they have to go and catch a crook or something, I suppose. We've not been here before? No. I've been saving this. I like this song. Im sorry. Im sorry. Im-- Im the one who should apologize... I knew, that we were now -- not just fifth cousins -- but very good friends. As soon as I can get away. time passed. Time measured now in Franklins visits to hyde park. Who was that? The President wishes to see me. And hes the President. He wishes to show me a new stamp. Where are we going? I don't know. I had it built. It's where Ill retire. Ill write those detective books I'm always talking about. go, take a look... go on... There's no better place to smell it Its heaven!! I have been thinking, Daisy... What? What have you been thinking? Id like to--. To share with you -- this. When I go away... You know I have to go ... away. Should you ever miss me...? Do you ever miss me? I always do. Always. A place to come. And be alone. And miss me... Oh! I am sorry! Sorry. That's all right! By now everyone was used to me. I was the cousin whos always visiting. No one ever even asked me why that was. Has he read this? I believe he has. "If one could choose, from all possible British personalities, the two who might make the best impression upon Americans -- King George and Queen Elizabeth would not even make the short list." How dare they talk about Royalty like this! No King of England had ever visited America before. But now he was coming -- to Hyde Park on Hudson. and the only quiet place left to work was outside What are those for? He has a headache. You do? His sinuses again. Happens this time every year. I know that. You didnt say anything about a headache. He's not going to trouble you with everything, Missy. You have enough on your plate. What does that mean? It means -- you take very good care of me. It means that you do too. Mrs Roosevelt, we appear not to have enough plates. What? We don't have enough plates. Someone miscounted. You tell me this now? Mrs Astor has called again. Franklin warned us, Mrs Astor will have plates. We'll borrow hers. today, stay out of Mothers way. On second thought -- we shall call for cook. Mrs Astor is so rich, she doesnt know what she has. Franklin's wife, Eleanor. Im just doing what Im told. So much for your little secret... - Good morning, Mother. - Good Morning. Eleanor. We are not going to serve the King of England - a cocktail!! Your Mother has now told me for the tenth time -- not to call her Royal Highness -- Elizabeth. Shes told me that too. I mean, please -- what century is this? Daisy? Daisy? Oh yes. She told me the same thing. I told her who did she think I was? I think she knows. Daisy? Hello! Youre just staring. Im not. I wasnt. What do you want? Eleanors just brought out fresh coffee. She was asking if youd like any. Shes staring again. Im not. Missy, Leave her alone. My husband lives for the adoring eyes of young women. We know this. Lets change the subject, shall we? Dont tell me youre embarrassed. That day, I would like to see. I didnt say I was embarrassed. Why do we care what a king or queen thinks about us? Real rosewood. Still got the smell. Is that why it cost so much? Hick called. For this morning's Royal visit she'd been ordered to produce five thousand children overnight. What? Why? m m As buffers for holding back the crowds. No. The Girl Scouts refused outright--. Good for them. They said their girls had taken an awful beating in DC! So she finally got some Boy Scouts! But when they were pushed, they pushed back! Started something like ten fist fights! When she finally got back to her office, she kicked off her shoes, opened her window and shouted out: God damn the King and Queen! well maybe saying the same thing tomorrow! Hick was short for Lorena Hickock. One of those friends of Eleanors Franklin called --- "she men." People said their marriage was troubled and unhappy. That they lived mostly separate lives. But I never saw that. Thats now how they seemed when they were together. We ended it up And stated our last hope for refuge. We must remind ourselves that these kings and queens or whatever-- are no better than us. Theyre just people. I read that in your column, Eleanor. Are you all right? You look in pain. - He has a sinus infection. - He gets them -- this time of year. Oh does he? I didnt know that. I took an aspirin. They just left Beacon. Good! wont be too long. Hick says I should get a month of columns out of this weekend. Hick says this King hates his brother. Theres a column right there. His brothers met with Hitler. That's good. Theres another column... And this is the family were having to our home for the weekend. you dont even live here. I am staying the night. Besides, I told your mother. I thought the brother gave up being king so he could marry the woman he loved. Daisy, have you ever met a man who would do that? Hick says she thinks the brother might be positioning himself to be the savior of the monarchy, once England has been defeated and the fascists have taken over. Of course. Hes young, Eleanor So is she. Theyre both young. Now let's just give them a break. Can we? And all the wild, the king and queen were getting close. Should we stop and meet some people. Wouldn't that be a good idea? But... We've just left... We're almost there. I don't think there are any more towns until... It's just a country road now. Still... He wants a cigarette. We dont want to be e-e-e-arly. No. No we dont. And I'd like to meet some Americans. Doesn't he want to meet you? He's busy. I know how important this is. Youre not going to let the side down. Dont worry. That is what Ive been telling myself too. You started to talk about the weekend's itinerary. You will be staying in the Roosevelt house. In fact, it is the President's mother's house, and she will officially be your hostess. Where is the President's house? This is where he lives. When he's not in Washington. With his m-m-mother? He doesn't have a house? He has a room. And his wife? She lives in another house. Hers. And he doesn't--? Which she shares with other -- women. Who make furniture. Im sorry? Furniture. They make it. Build it. They're couples. They're the sort who like each other. The Ambassador's wife, after having visited Hyde Park... Why do they call it that? - What? - Hyde Park, is in London. It's confusing to me. I don't know. Our Ambassador's wife wrote - and I think you need to hear this. She wrote "It is a dismal house, extremely badly run, and most uncomfortable." ## I don't want to set the world on fire ## I just want to start a flame in your heart ## In my heart... Half of his cabinet had been against the visit. The country, they said, was in no position to take sides in another European War. So Franklin invited them here where, out of the spotlight, we could all relax and just be ourselves. ## I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim ## I just want to be the one you love ## And with your admission that you feel the same ## I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of ## Believe me ## I don't want to set the world on fire ## I just want to start a flame in your heart Looking back, I now see how important this day was, to them, to us, to the world. And of course -- as it turned out, to me. Oh, what lovely ships. My son built them when he was a boy. How very clever. Wasnt that clever? T-t-terribly clever. He also did the birds... as a boy. Until the taxidermy smells made him ill. Hell tell you about it. I shall look forward to that. ## I don't want to set the world on fire ## I just want to start a flame in your heart Come in. Please, I can't tell you, how I am awfully of this. My Mother, hasn't spoken of nothing else for months.. Hei, Daisy! Mr. Camerons with the embassy -- this is Daisy. Hello! How do you do? How do you do? That day, the President, sent me upstairs on a mission... to spy... behind enemies lines. Charming. Look at that view. You must tell me about everything. That's -- the field. We have fields just like that. Those hills -- lead down to the river. So that's where they go. What are you doing? I came to see if I could be any help. Do you mind if I call you Elizabeth? No. No. So these are the beds -- your friend made?. Those are them. Not bad. Not bad. Is my wife behaving herself? Yes! Has my mother calmed down? Shes fine! Its like a madhouse. Dont worry. All quiet on the upstairs front. He's definitely younger than I'd imagined. For a King, you know.... Is he... And they both seem nervous. That surprised me. Without some help from us, Daisy -- there soon might not be an England -- to be King of. So Id be nervous too. Anyway, thats why theyre here. Damn it. Let me do it. Let me do it. They seem very nice people. Smell like Martini. Later tonight, after the dinner and all that is over, what do you say, you and I get out of here? J J Go someplace quiet. I think Ill need that. Well -- I think Im free. Its going to be a big, big success. Oh -- it's you. We share a bath. So I was t-t-told. So we don't have to go through the... Yes. What were you looking at? These prints. I just told the President's mother how humorous I found them. What are they of--? British soldiers. The 1812 War. Cartoons actually. Mocking them. Us. They put you in a room with--? The mother tried to apologize. I told her I found them funny. She said she tried to remove them, but her son insisted. Why would he do that? What was he trying to say? I don't know. I don't know. He knows this is important. He knows why were here. May I have a drink too? How many have you had? The mother just left. Cheers. She apologized for everything. For Eleanor m-m-mostly. And for the hot dogs. Hot dogs? What are you talking about, Bertie? It appears that at the picnic tomorrow--. There's a picnic tomorrow? In our honour. You hate picnics. At the picnic, the President's wife has organized that hot dogs be served as our main dish. I gather she's even publicized this in the column she writes. Are they trying to make fun of us? I d-d-don't kn-kn-know. What do you think? Youre not going to tell Mother, are you, Mary? Not a soul, sir. Mary, we all knew, was one of Mothers spies. Mother had spies them too. These are revolting. They make our seamen look like monkeys. I can't believe he thought these would make you laugh, Bertie. I 'laughed'. They're trying to make us seem -- common. Your brother would never have stood for this. I'm sorry, but he wouldn't. I th-th-think if we j-j-just ignore the-the-these--. Please, stop stuttering! I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I didn't mean it, Bertie. I think I have a headache. My face feels hot. Feel sorry. I am not my brother. Thank God for that. And you are not the D-d-duchess of Windsor. You are better than that. I just hate to see you... See me...? Laughed at. Mother, who had a sixth sense for sniffing out alcohol, was on the warpath. Mothers father had been a nasty drunk. Is he coming down? What is that doing in here? Leave it, Mother. I thought we had agreed. That's not true. I'm not going to serve the King and Queen of England -- Dammit, I said -- leave it!! close the door. Daisy. m m Why are you shouting? I am not shouting! Close the door, Daisy! Should I stay? Just close it. He's brought out the drinks tray, Eleanor. Franklin, you promised. As I said to Mother, that's not true. Maybe after dinner!! Dont shout, Mother. J J We have guests. I know we have guests! And I know who they are! And my son is not going to serve them cocktails! Theyre my guests!! Its my house!! Youre the one who wants us to live here. Eleanor, please, dont-- remember that. Give me the tray. Isnt it true? No. Yes. Im the President!! Oh! Just stop this! Stop this. You behave like a child!!! I have the programme for tomorrow's 'event.' This is for the hot dog picnic? There will be entertainment as well. Perhaps I should be surprised. Indians. No. "Ish-Ti-Opi." What??? He's called here "The Indian Baritone." So he's going to sing. There's "Princess Te Ata." She is going to show us "The Indian Corn Ceremony." Oh god. "Accompanied by Kurkus Pahitu on the Tom-Tom." There's our incentive not to be hungover. The 'tom-tom.' 'Hot dogs.' 'Cartoons of British naval officers as monkeys.' Come in. The President is waiting for you in his study, your Majesty. He said it was time for -- childrens hour. Drinks. And the Queen? She's been allowed more time to relax. Here we go... Good luck! Sir, my Mother does not approve of cocktails. And thinks you might rather have a cup of tea. M-m-my m-m-mother would have said the s-s-s-same thing. Actually I-I-I-I-I prefer a-a-a-a... ... cocktail. A man after my own heart... So she said: Im so pleased to meet you, Mr. President, Ive only met three Americans. Joe Kennedy, J.P. Morgan, and Fred Astaire. Thank God, I said, you met Mr. Astaire, or what would you think of the rest of us? Good evening. Good evening. Mrs. R-r-r Roosevelt Mrs. R-r-r-r-r-ro-ro... Id love to, your majesty. We could have sold tickets to this dinner, and made ourselves a pile of money. The moon was coming up there was a warm... summer breeze It was... just... her A perfect summer night! To His Majesty, the King. Inside... Everyone was very impressed behavior! To His Majesty, the King. And to Her Majesty, the Queen! Actually, normally, we wouldnt toast the Queen. The tray... was of Mrs.Astor 24 plates collapsed for no reason. just before the soup. What happened? I don't know. No one touched it. I su-su-suppose an angel just passed - a ve-ve-ry clumsy one. but some people had other explanation... Its the full moon. Daisy? Oh hello, Dick. You think its full tonight? What? Oh -- yes. That moon certainly is full. She says Im right! Oh, I don't know for sure--. I could be wrong. I just.... Such an important night. Is it? I dont know. Whats one king more or less? He still has to put his pants on one leg at a time. Did you curtsey for the Queen, Daisy? I certainly did!! And I think I did it right. I didnt fall down! How come youre not inside there, Daisy? Im glad to see you working. Its just for the one night... Well its something... Can I take some home for my dog? He doesnt have a dog. Touch me there again, youll be wearing it and not eating it... Nu-nu-number 2! Shoot! Those damn horses. Its not the horses fault--. I know. I know. You like them. Ive been looking for you. Do you need a handkerchief? Come here. We saw you out here--. We?? Franklins asked me to tell you that you could go home. He thinks hes going to be occupied with the King all evening now. Of course he will... No one lost to go to bed that night. Finally Franklin had to instruct the band to stop playing. He wished to spend time with the king, on his own. Let's go to my study. Will be quiet out there. Unless you need to--. No. No. Would you mind pushing? Her Majesty has gone to bed? She has. And -- your wife? Who knows? I'm sure. Would you my closing the door. Cheers. Cheers. Do you collect stamps? I did. I have. I understand you are a serious stamp collector. Perhaps, you would show me some of your stamps. You cant be interested. But I am --. Do not -- protest. When I was a young man -- before my marriage of course -- I found that showing ones stamps was a very helpful way to get a young womans attention. Was it. But I suppose if your fathers the king... Who needs stamps? The Queen is certainly a lovely woman. As is the first lady. Shes a -- strong -- person Some days you don't feel like getting out of bed -- but then these women, they wont let you do that, will they? No. What do you do -- to be alone? You need to give them a reason not to bother you. You can figure things out in the quiet of your own mind. I open up my stamp books and everyone knows not to bother me. You were wonderful tonight, young man. What do you mean? Just what I said. You were graceful. You were confident. You're going to be a very fine king. I don't know what to say. Your father would be very proud. Im not so certain about that. If I were your father, Id be proud. The Queen -- shes... She worries so much. Its been hard for her. Women worry. I just stop listening to her sometimes. Forget I said that. Forgotten. Ive been asked to say things... Such a war as we now co-cocontemplate --. The carnage, Think at S-S-S-Spain. Ch-children -- b-bbombed. Tha-tha-thats what we can expect. It will b-b-be horrific. And yet we know some of your countrymen wi-wi-wi-sh my country ii- i-i-ill... And w-w-want us to fail. And want me to fail wi-th-thth you... This god damn st-st-stutter... What stutter? This god damn polio. Sometimes I think -- they deserve better than me. My -- subjects. Im sorry. I dont know why-why Im saying this to you. Im s-s-supposed to be trying to convince you to help us. Let me confess something to you, now. As you have been so honest-- with me. No one -- ever mentions the fact that I cant use my legs. Its never referred to. Not by anyone. I used to think it was because they were embarrassed about it. But now I think its because is not what they want to see. Of course you and I We think they see everything that we are. All our flaws. Or transgressions. Or failures. But that is not what theyre looking to find when they look to us. And God help us if that ever changes. Do you imagine the disappointment... when they find out what we really are. Thank you. They didnt want me as their King. I didnt know they voted for that in England. Im thinking -- another drink? Right! Suddenly only one can sleep that night Was it the moon? How a longed fan I beg your pardon... Sir. I mean, Your Highness. Your Majesty... Good night. You're still awake? Mmmmmmm. I think I'll go to sleep. It's late. Why are you smiling? Are you drunk? No. He's a very funny man. Has some wonderful jokes. Like what? I couldn't tell you. They're not meant for women. They sound very 'funny.' He liked my stories too. What stories? I-I-I told him about the coronation. About how they p-p-put the crown wrong way around. And the stepping on my robe so I couldn't move. You shouldn't have told him that. We don't make fun of ourselves. That's not true. Not here. Of course he liked those stories, they make us look like fools. They make us look like people! Don't be naive, Bertie. He made fun of himself too. He said at the picnic tomorrow-- Oh god that picnic. He said that the Indians -- they were Eleanor's ideas. "One of my-my-my wife's crazy ideas." His Mother is furious about it. Franklin's just trying to keep it short. He talks about his wife like that to you? I hope you didn't talk about me to him. I didn't. I wouldn't do that. We didn't talk about you. I asked him -- without mentioning you -- about these hot dogs? What's that about? You want to know what he said? He said he doesn't get the fuss. They're just a good thing to eat at a picnic. There's no 'meaning.' Nothing more. You didn't say I was concerned? No. I'm not sure I believe you--. That's not fair. Three different women tonight asked me if I thought there could ever be an American queen. If we'd ever 'allow' that. That was rude. Give me a cigarette? I have smoked all of mine. That won't help you sleep. I know. Thank you. Give me lighter? Light, of course! I never wanted this life. I know. Its hard. I'll be fine. If there's a war -- and we know there will be -- he believes America could be persuaded to help. Did you see some of the people here tonight? Hear their names? They're from Italy. Germany. They're Irish. - Their ancestors-- - they're Jews. They hate us, Bertie!! They want to see us fall on our face!! They want to laugh at us!! I think you're wrong. I th-th- think we just need to be a little more confident. I'm not sure I can even sleep. Finally, he patted me on the knee and said, 'young ma-ma-man, it's time for you to go to bed." Like a father, I suppose. He's very happy that I am king. Good Night. ## If I didn't care more than words can say ## If I didn't care would I feel this way? ## If this isn't love then why do I thrill? ## And what makes my head go 'round and 'round ## While my heart stands still? ## If I didn't care would it be the same? ## Would my ev'ry prayer begin and end with just your name? ## And would I be sure t hat this is love beyond compare? ## Would all this be true if I didn't care for you? If ever I missed him, there was a place hed built for me to come, and be alone, and miss him. What the hell are you doing up here? Tommy? What the hell are you doing here? You shouldnt be up here now. Why? Why not? Can you get that out of my face, please? President can't be disturbed right now, Daisy. Daisy! How nice to see you up here. Do you want to see the President? Come back. Come back! Daisy!! Daisy!! Daisy!! Here. No. Get out of here. Listen to me, Daisy. He wants to talk to you. Hes going home. Hes headed home. I want you to listen to me. very very carefully. Understand? Understand? Look at me. Look at me, Daisy. Understand? I know you are -- intimate. I've known since the day it happened. What?? Those things he said? He meant them. I know that. That hurt. Cigarette? I need one. But I accepted. Like you will. I am a part of his life, and I accept that you are too. I don't accept you. What about Dorothy Schiff? Do you accept her? Why do you think she has built that place next to Top Cottage? - There are other cottages on that hill-- - He asked her to. He asked her to build a cottage, so they could live close together when he retired, while he wrote those goddamn detective books he's always talking about writing. I read the letter. When was that? This year. It wasnt Eleanor who abandoned him. She caught him too. With you? No. This was -- long ago. Years and years ago. Maybe youve met her. Mrs. Rutherford. I... I misunderstood. I wonder... I wanna us... realistic. I don't think I can ... 'share'- Oh I think you can. You can. You decide. You won't go to bed. Hes waiting for you. Missy and my Mother both severely criticized me for not having invited you to the dinner tonight. I want to apologize. I think I showed you these when you first came to visit me, Daisy. But you probably don't remember. I remember. Aren't they beautiful? Can you see from over there? The highest waterfall in the world. That's on this stamp. I really don't think you can see from way over there, Daisy. I really don't. And that -- would be terrible. Not to. How do you see me? What? Am I -- to you -- just stupid? No, Daisy. But I can understand how you can feel that way. Am I -- Like... a whore? No, you are not 'like a whore.' Now would you come over and sit by me. No, youre not getting off that easy, you son of a bitch!! But thats not what I said. Instead: No. I need to go. Id say Im sorry -- but that wouldnt do any good right now, would it? Someones coming out. Which one is she? The one you think looks like a governess. I tought she was the governess. I understand that's a very common thing -- men and their children's governesses. She's not the governess. But she's obviously his mistress. She dresses like a--. She's not the governess, Bertie. Men find -- some men find-- I think because they're around children, there's something quite attractive about-- Why do you keep talking about governesses? Is there something you want to tell me? No. Nothing. Why? Look over there. The secretary? I hadnt seen her before. And she's his mistress too. According to Cameron. - We don't need Cameron to--. - Cameron says there's another one. Another--? Who's married. But she's built a cottage by his? Or something. Another mistress? Good thing we changed our minds about bringing Lilibet with us. You changed your mind. I never wanted to bring Lilibet to America. Only be-be-because you don't like Americans. I like Americans. Thats not fair. I dont like a lot of Americans. I like some. Bertie, are you going to eat a hot dog? What??? At the picnic. Tomorrow. Today. I mean, isn't it like having say the PM over and serving him bangers and mash? He probably would like--. To a guest! If we did that he'd know we were trying to tell him something. He'd understand. What would he understand? How we felt about him. The PM knows how we feel about him. We like him. As if that matters. You know what I mean. I wish I did. Bertie, I don't think your brother would eat a hot dog. How would you know that? Because he'd know what was meant!! It doesn't mean anything!!! The walls, sir. They are quite thin. - We know. - One can hear--. Everyone in this house is already awake. But to answer your question, Elizabeth, I am going to eat a hot dog, no five hot dogs, ten! I'm going to shove them into my mouth, stick two up my nostrils, two more in my ears, then walk around so people can take pictures of the King of England with hot dogs hanging out of his orifices!! Don't ever compare me to my brother again. Sir. It's the President. Has she gone? What do you think shes going to do? I dont think shell cause you any trouble. If thats what youre asking. Is that what youre asking? Theyll see us. Hello! And good morning! - Wave. - I am. Hello! Hello! Lovely morning, isn't it? Sleep well?! Oh yes. Yes, we did. Didn't we? We did! Good! Me too!! I thought I might have a swim... Come along? gosh... a swim. Daisy is that you? Let me help. Youre up early. I just woke up. And so, the day of the picnic began. And everyone pretended, as usual... not to notice anything. They feeding you all right out here? Boys. Throwing you the odd bone? Were eatin like kings. Mr. President. You have king to thank for that. I made them all agree -- no pictures in our bathing suits. Though you dont look so bad. Maybe you should get your picture taken like that... And get the womens vote. But thats right -- you dont vote for king. you two counfy like that? Yes, thank you. Here we are. I'm not driving with him again. Wave... Wave, wave... Shes here. Good for her. What are you doing? Im ... so pleased you came. I promised my Aunt. How do you do? How do you do. Mrs. Langdorf So nice to meet you. Tommy, looks whos here. Daisy, would you come with me? Tommy, she has every right to be here. He wants her sitting with him. Im not doing that. Who wants you sitting with him? The President, maam. Daisy... Daisy, please. Where are your manners? Lets sit up with the President. Just Daisy, thank you maam. Please. Daisy, What were you doing way over there, The special guests are here on the porch. You should be here. Please sit down, Daisy. Please, Daisy. How much more of this is there? Thank you, Indian Baritone! Thank you so much. He wasn't finished. Oh. I thought he was. Thank you, thank you. Let's all say thank you, to Ish-Ti-Opi in Cherokee which is tokapi Tokapi Come all say it again, boys and girls come on... Let's enjoy it, say Tokapi b Tokapi./b Thank you, thank you so much. at last... after Eleanor's Indians... the event we're all secretly waiting for... Your Majesty... Would you like -- a hot dog? Do you take mustard? I take ... whatever you think I should take with my hot dog. Allow us then to put a bit of mustard on for you. Daisy, would you show how we put the mustard. You are too kind. Why are they applauding? It's all right! It's fine! What's this about? And like that -- we felt America and England were back on the road to being very good friends. At least, Im told thats how some people took it. It made me wonder -- maybe the hot dogs hadnt been Eleanors idea after all. When he left for England later that day, the King sent back a telegram, in which he wrote that our two nations had now forged -- and these are his words: ba special relationship./b It's good! It's all fine! I'll have another!! The next day, he sent a car. But I said I was too ill to take a drive. I was ill the next day. And the next. And the next day after that. A week after the Royals visit to Hyde Park, the President came in person to my house. Good morning. I had been waiting. He drove us by the plumbing shop where his mother had returned the toilet seat she had ordered for the Royal Visit, without paying for it. He tried to make me laugh. And he was good at that. He was after all a politician. Mother wants to pay him now. But he says its really been good for business. He hoped I would forgive him. But I was damned if I was going to tell him that I already had. Occasionally now, Missy would come and fetch me when she felt --. I think he could use -- your company tonight. Let him wait. m m When we play cards... Missy and I are partners... we now share everything! I learned, as we got to know each other better, of Missy's bouts with her 'blackness.' And of her 'dark days.' When she fell terribly ill. He paid for everything. He even changed his will -- giving her half -- should she outlive him. But to the surprise of nearly everyone -- he did not visit her once in the hospital. I asked him why. It's a terrible fault of mine, he said. I find it too painful to be around illness. I grew close not only to Missy but to all of Franklins boys. They seemed to accept me, no questions asked. And no more promised were made so none could be broken. A year pass... And then, another... and another... I watch him grow tired, and fail and ill He tried the high best of everyone... He knew how to do that. for everyone, but me... Mr. President. Ok boys, Take it away! Everyone still looking to him. Still seeing it ever was. J J They want to see. In the time... Not so very long ago... When the world still allowed themselves secrets... Franklin Roosevelt was mine.
