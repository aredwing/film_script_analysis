What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! With this bowel recession, we see how the tumor has blocked the bowel, therefore we resect the bowel and remove the tumor, giving our patient a patent G.I. tract again. If we're not careful to take a nice margin of healthy tissue - on either side of the diseased tissue... - Adam, I need to talk to you. - I can't right now. - It's an emergency. - I'll call you later. - Could you excuse Adam for one minute? - You're in deep shit. - I know. What are you gonna do? Maybe you can take me to California with you. No. You can forget about that. You're not putting this on me! - I'm desperate. - I am going to be doing my residency. Do you have any idea how hard that is? Right, I won't get in your way. Please, Adam, just help me. Look, you took the high road, I'm the big loser. But I wanna be different now. - Just go with yourself. - I need a good influence in my life now. If I live with you, it might help me clean up my act. - I've heard that before. - No. It'll be different, I promise. I'll be good-boy Max. No more coke? No more coke. - Goodbye, my little surgeon. - Take care, V an. - So, is Max coming to say goodbye? - Uh, no. You're my only son, Max. Everybody else abandoned me. I'm not abandoning you. I just gotta get outta New York. - I'm in trouble here. - You're in trouble wherever you go, boy. It follows you like the plague. Thanks for the encouragement. Look, I gotta take off. - I love you. I'll call you when I get there. - Yeah, sure you will. Thanks, buddy. - You're crazy, you know that? - I know. Peace, New York! Peace to your moms.

I'm Max Verbinski. I'm here to see the guy who's hiring. Come on in. Basically I think I'm, like, the best guy around at computers. I mean, if you hire me, I-I... I'm pretty confident that, uh, I'll advance very rapidly, because, well, I think I can pretty much say I'm better and faster than anybody else you have here. Well, actually, uh, I took this personality test when I was a kid, and basically they said I was, like, one in a million. Except for my brother. He's pretty smart. So, like, one of two in a million. We'll try you out. Great. Great. All right. Well, put her there, boss. And punch and duck. Bend those knees. Adam, I got it! - Excellent. - Wait one second. Now swing your arms. Come on, work out with me. It'll make you feel good. Come on, girls. Yeah, I'm gonna be making a tenth of what I was making before, but I feel a lot cleaner now. Well, that's great. Welcome to the responsible world. Now... let's do 50 crunches, right now. Wow, glad you're excited. Ah, it's good to be at work. - Hey, Bob. - Hi, Max. Catch the Lakers? - Yeah. Go Kobe.

Yeah? Phew! Ken doll bastard. That's funny, man. That's pretty funny. - How do you do it? - What? Aren't you bored out of your mind? This will make things exciting. Aw, no, no, no. I can't do that. Drugs are bad. Suit yourself. You suit yourself. Hey, bro. Wanna go to a movie? No way. I'm beat. I'm goin' to bed. Wha? You're not even gonna work out? Come on, let's do 50 crunches right now. Yeah, right, Hercules. Not tonight. The night's young... Just go hang out with your friends from work. - They're all nerds. - You need to make friends, Max. Look at this mess. What, did you shit all over the kitchen? Max! OK. OK, good. Max, come on. Come here. Man, this is so hot. Oh, man, that's sick. Gore-Gore Girls. It's the fucking best. Sometimes when I'm alone, I call myself Luke. I'm just fuckin' with ya. But I could do some serious damage to Carrie Fisher. Oh, yeah. These rockets are great. Exact replicas of NASA's Apollo mission rockets. I wanted to work for Lockheed, to design missiles, but they wouldn't hire me. Idiots. Now for some rocket fuel. - You ever tried? It's crystal meth. - No. Oh, man, it's the best. So much more intense than coke. And it lasts longer, so you don't have to snort as much. Here. Try some. All right. Twisted my arm. Time for the show. Ah, damn. - Burns. - Now we're ready for launch. Blastoff! - Oh, wow! - Oh, yeah! Awesome. This is like nerds havin' fun. We're ready, Mission Control. Three, two, one! - Oh, man. - Oh, shit!

Cost me 150 bucks! - Speed freak! Have some of your own medicine! - What are you doin'? Stop that. - I got him. Yeah! - That's it. You are so dead. - Get him, Max! - You like that? I got him. - Yeah! We'll get you back! Max, go! Yeah! Oh, shit! Roscoe, sic his balls! Ha-ha. - Max, can I come in? - Uh, hang on. Don't have to be at the hospital till after four. Thought we'd go to the beach. Sorry, bro. I already have plans. I took your advice. I made a friend. That's great. Happy girl hunting. Hi. Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies. Drinking alcohol on the beach is illegal. But I won't tell. Fuck you. Asshole. Baby. Feels good. Yeah. - Whoo. - Whoo! Thank you. Thank you! Yes! You are hot! My brother thinks he's gonna be a doctor. I'm the doctor of love. Yes! Hello, America, and welcome to "Fact or Fiction?" I'm your host, Ron Vicker. Now on today's show, let's welcome back ourchampion, Bunny. - Hi. - Oh, Bunny, come on in. Psst. - Whoo! Ha-ha. - Yeah. Hey, what are you guys doin'? Ohh, is that cocaine? No, man. This stuff's better. Want some? - Oh. - All right. - Did you get signed consent? - Yes. - X-rays? - They're... I had them. Goddamn it, Verbinski. Get back to Radiology and get them, now. One minute. Why am I still seeing you? This is gonna help you relax, sir. Ah-ah. What about the Betadine? - Sorry. First time I put in a chest tube. - That's OK. You're doing just fine. - I think this guy's got a dropped lung. - Let me see the film. You're right. Can I get some help? Yeah! Who are you kidding, man? You're a total fucking wimp. I may look like one, but I know how to throw a punch. - I can take a punch, too. - Oh, yeah? Let's see what you got. - Doctor, we need your help over here. - Start up another kit. - Where's the other intern? - Page him again. - Doctor, please? - I'll be right there. Ooh! Ooh. Ohh. Ooh! Yeah! - Ow! - Ooh, ooh. Man, what are you doin'? - Oh! - Shit. Dude. Why'd you do that, Max? Don't hit me on top of the head, partner. Hey, what the hell's goin' on in here? Who's back there? Skeet, clean him up. Bob, get back to work. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Max. Come here, I wanna talk to you. Come here. Did you punch him? Yeah. Nice shot. - Thanks. - I've always hated that bumpkin. So, you wanna go out tonight? Could use a wingman. Indeed. Is that a yes or a no, Max? Indeed, yes. No fighting on company time, Wally. I'm sorry. Oh, man, I am so fuckin' horny. Indeed. Indeed. # Gotta save yourself 'Cause the world don't love you no more All right, man, she's yours. Hi. Fuck you. Another round. I'm not good with girls my age. I date younger chicks. No, no, no, no, it's not you. They aren't out for a killer lay. They got their good fucks in college. - What do I say to 'em? - Look, we're not dealing with geniuses. These girls wanna be movie stars. Oh, man! There's Janet. I been waiting to fuck her since she transferred to our office. - Janet? - Yeah, man. Love ballin' nerdy chicks. I feel like a hero. # Don't love ya no more # Aah # There's no way # Out, there's no way out There's no way out # There's no way out There's no way... Hey, how are you doin'? Uh, I'm a producer. - Wow. Really? - I produce movies. - I'll put you in one of my movies. - You'll put me in one of your movies? I'm Max. - King of the bedroom? - I'll be the judge of that. - Wanna dance? - Yeah, yeah! Oh, man, I love this song. # There's no way out Don't hurt yourself. There's a... Wow. Wow, thanks. - Would have been here all night. - You'll still be here all night. Yeah. Well... Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-oo hoo-hoo! I'm gonna get you. Ah! Ah. Gotcha. I gotcha, bunny-wunny. What if I told you all I like to do is watch soap operas and have orgasms? I love you. Well, see, I used to have this little bunny, and it was so cute, but it never let you pet it, you know, and it was so frustrating. It was like... like a furry little tease, and I wanted to, like, catch it and jerk off on it. - So we're on for this weekend? - I can't wait to meet Terry. - Aw, man, she's great. - I got special plans for us this weekend. You and Bruce? Wally, clean it up. I just can't picture it. Since when do you hang around with Mr. Universe? I hang out with everyone. Everyone likes me. I'm not gonna hang out with that guy. So don't. Max Verbinski. Hey, brother Adam. What's up? Oh, I'm just hangin' with my computer buddies. Dinner. 8:00. What's the occasion? Surprise? All right, long as you're payin'. I'm flat as a matzah. All right, I'll see you tonight. Peace. - Cool. - Time to work. You had to say that. Yo, Skeet. Got any of the good stuff from the other day? You're out of control. I don't feel right about it. Fuck. Max, you don't have any on you, do you? Got any cash? Yeah, I got 20 bucks. All right. I'll join ya. Wow, this is... this is great, Adam. It reminds me of the old days in New York. Look, first of all, I want you to know how proud I am of you. I mean, being clean for so long. I never thought you could really do it. Yeah. Thanks, man. And because of that, I have a little surprise for you. Wait a second here. What did you do, Adam? - Did you set up a double date for us? - You got it, baby. Nurses?! Oh, my gosh. It's too much. Hi, I'm Trixie. I'm Ditsie. I dropped my fork. Um... - Who's your big brother? - You are. - Gotta dance. - All right. All right, let's get crazy! Yeah! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! - Max! - Max! - Max! - Max! Max! - Max! Max! - Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max? Max. Mom? V an? This is the surprise I talked about. I wanted to show 'em how well you were doing. Why'd you bring her here? She hates me. As if you haven't given her enough reason. Shame. Shame? Look at your hairstyle. Honey, honey, when are you gonna learn? Zebras don't change their stripes. - Yeah. - Hey! Whoo! Whoo! # The smoke nearly choked the stars # When I put you out # To think this was... Nice. #... it would go - Ready to fly, girls? - Ready to fly. # And for five... #... I let you burn # I said, for five... Max, she's asking if it's safe. This is the first time I've ever had any people up in the plane. - Four times he's practiced. - It's really pretty up here. What'd I tell you? I told you it's gonna be a great day, and it's a great day. - Wow. That's impressive. - Yeah. - Awesome. - Yeah. Hey, can I try for a minute? The plane is yours. Take the controls. Oh. - Ah! - Don't fuck up. - Wow! - Whoo! Fucked up! - Max, what are you doing? - I don't know. - There's something out there! - There's nothing out there. - Guys... - Aah! My God! A bird! - You're hallucinating. - It's a pterodactyl! Pterodactyl, my ass! Give me the fucking controls! - You're hallucinating! - God, he's coming right at us! - Give me the controls. - I'm fuckin'... Stop it, Max! You fuckin' let go! - I'm not letting go! - Stop it! What the hell? - Adam, what the hell's going on? - You promised me. No more drugs. I said no more cocaine. This isn't coke. - I really thought you were changing. - I am. I just got a promotion! Shh. - Keep your voice down. - Why? - You gotta move out. - What the fuck, ma... Look, you don't even know what happened to me today. I almost died. I want you outta here, Max. You don't even care. Fucking cold-hearted. Is everything all right, Adam? - Who's this? - None of your business. What, she pop your cherry? Shut up and get out! No. - Get out. - Uh-uh. Hey. Hey! This isn't funny. Now get out! No. Hey. Fine. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ohh. Oh, my... There you go, Doc. Left you a little stool sample. - My favorite rug. - Oh, my... Oh, that's great, Bunny. As you know, Bunny has won $17,000... Oh, my God. You all right? - You thinking about your brother? - Yeah. Adam. Good pickup. You're the only one who caught that bleeder. That's terrific work for an intern. You're assisting tomorrow. Seven a. m. in Surgery. Thank you, sir. Dr. Verbinski. I'm sorry I shit on your favorite rug. Was it hard to clean up? I hope you die. What did he say? That we're brothers forever. Here we are, buddy. This is what they call the Grand Canyon. It's a big one. - This is beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. They put a canopy up over this. You gotta just kinda jump to get over. Now it's behind the clouds, man. - It's starting to get warm, don't you think? - Mm-hm. Look at that. There it is. - Oh, my gosh. - There it is. Look at that. Whoo! It's pretty much right on time. That is sweet. It's a beautiful thing right there, Max. What is this, a business meeting? Bob, Janet, can you give Max and I a second, please? Look, Max, this is your warning. I dare you to bring that shit in here again. Ohh. Ahh. Whoo! Brucie, Brucie, Brucie puce-y. - Can kiss my ass. - Yes, indeed. Hey, Skeety dog. I think Skeety dog needs some love. Cut it out. - Bruce said he needs to see you. - Ohh. Skeety dog, the messenger boy. MBM. Max Verbinski speaking. Max, it's your old man. Hey, Dad. I was just gonna call you. Savor it, it's been a year - and don't worry, I didn't miss you. I called to tell you I can't make your brother's wedding. His wedding? And I know your brother Adam doesn't really wanna see me. I guess you're on your own, son. - Take it easy. - OK. - You wanted to see me? - Yeah, have a seat. Max, the work you did on your last assignment was substandard. Oh, man, I had an off week. You should see the stuff I'm doing now. It is amazing. - Max, you have a problem. - Oh, get outta here! I'm fine. Don't bullshit me. Having a near-death experience doesn't mean you have to turn into a jerk. I'm giving you a chance, man. Take it or leave it. But I'm a genius, man. Aren't there special rules? Well... Look. You are corrupting my employees, you are totally out of control. The party has gone on way too long, and it's time to stop. This is so lame, man. Max, I'm not firing you. I'm giving you a choice. A choice? Choose this. Ohh! You fuckin' bastard. No, I don't wanna fight. - What? - Got fired. - Didn't you get the choice to go to rehab? - Yep. - So go. - Nah. Think I'm gonna take some time off. What do you mean? Don't you think you have a problem, Max? I'll probably quit drugs tomorrow. I just don't wanna work anymore. - Mazel tov. - Mazel tov. - What about money? - Maybe we can switch around. - I'll watch soaps all day, you go work. - I don't know how to do anything. I don't like to work. Well, what are we gonna do? - Tsk. Guess it's time to ramble. - What? Sometimes you just gotta ramble. Bro, this shit looks good. I'm gonna fuck 17 hookers tonight. I ain't gonna stop till they rip my dick off at the base. This is the good shit. This is the "go fast. " We can get 20 grand easy on the street for this. - Fuckin' 40 grand, my friend. - You ain't bullshittin'? T- Ray. - Look, T-Ray. - Huh? Bro, you see that giraffe, bro? Just smoke, man. Ah. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Hello? Where have you been? I've been calling all day. Hey. It's been a while. Max, you know why I'm calling. I'm calling about Dad. What's up? I just got off the phone with the doctors in New York. - They think Dad only has a couple days. - Oh, jeez. We gotta catch a plane tonight. I'll work out the flight. OK? Just meet me at 9:30 at the pier. All right. I'll be there. Yep! Ah. Oh, yeah. - I gotta go to New York. My father's dying. - I'm sorry. Take care of this for me? Guard it with your life. - All right. - Hey. Now you just blow that "guard that with my life" stuff? - Hi. - Hi there. Tell me you're here alone. I'm out on the prowl. Looks like you're the man with all the action. What do I gotta do to get a bag like that? What do I gotta do to get a bag like you? Ooh, ooh, my fuckin' balls are blue! Whoo! Damn, you're hot. - What's your name? - I don't know. # Hold on, hold on # Hold on, hold on... Heat it up. Gonna burn the place up, dude. I'll burn as much as I want. By the '70s, the big bang theory was already well established. So they tried to come up with alternative scenarios for the universe's evolution, like, what if you mess around with gravity or strength of the electromagnetic force? What do you think that will do to the universe's evolution? - Nothing. - Wrong, dumbass. Even the slightest tinkering derails the whole process. You're just focusing on what you want to. There's just as much evidence for a random universe, that life is completely insane and chaotic. What are you talking about, man? Even the most seemingly random events have logic behind them. As far as my life goes, I know exactly what I'm doing. Geniuses don't make mistakes. They instigate their own problems so they can be worked out for deeper insight. Chaos is harder to embrace. It's scary to think there's no one out there looking out for us. Just smoke, man. # Hold on, hold on # Hold on, hold on # Hold on, hold on # Hold on... - Hey. - Hey. - Come here to Mama. - It's been a long night. # Hold on, hold on I really gotta get going. # Hold on... Carl?! - Christine, who the fuck is this?! - Carl... Shut up, bitch. You been gone two fucking days! - Don't! Leave him alone! - Come on, I didn't do anything! - Shut up and get out! - I don't even know her name! Hey, man, come on, I... - Let's get out of here. - Where we goin', man? I got an idea. Tuck that shit in, man. - Yes? - Uh, hi, uh... Jo. Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm Max. Adam's brother? Remember we met one time? Oh, yes. You shat on the carpet. - Is-is Adam here? - No, he's not back from work yet. Um... well, could we wait for him? Uh... Blood pressure's dropping. I need some more suction. I can't see. - 110 over 70. - Not there, here. - I need another clamp. - Hell, we just lost the pulse. Open up the IV s full bore. Fuck. Oh, yeah, that's it. Yeah. Put that away. Put that away. Hey, Adam. How you doin'? What the fuck are you doin' here? I... I just came by so we could go visit Dad. - He's dead. - Aw, shit. - We all missed you at the funeral. - You guys had a funeral without me? What the fuck do you care? You wouldn't have come anyway. Yeah, I would have. You know I was with him to the very end? He could have cared less. All he kept asking for was you. I'm sorry. Look, if it was Mom, you know she would have asked for you. Would it have been so hard to just jump on a plane? One time, do the right thing. Just... just once. I'm sorry. There was a lot of traffic. I couldn't meet you. Oh, you-you fucking liar! Is nothing important to you? - I really wanted to be there. - Bullshit! I did. I'm here now. A- A-Are you OK? No, Max, I'm not OK. Are you gonna take care of me? That's a fuckin' joke. Get out. - What? - Get out! - Is that how you want it? - Get the fuck out! - Get the signed consent? - Got it right here. - X-rays? - Uh, no. - Where the fuck are they? - Radiology. You want me to get 'em? Maybe we should ask the patient. Has everybody else done their job today? - Hey, Cohen. - Yeah? - Sorry I yelled earlier. - It's OK. It's my fault. No, you're doing great. It's just that I have a temper sometimes. But I'm working on it. OK. Dr. Verbinski, they need you in O.R. 4 now. I'll be right there. Oh, yeah. That's it. Good. Max? Max? Adam, Max just called. He's in jail. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to tell him. - Thanks for coming. - Sure. So what does your attorney say? Uh, well, I mean, he said I'll probably be out in, like, six months on parole. I mean, I'll have to do community service for, like, the rest of my life, but... well, at least I'll be free. But at least I'm clean. I mean, I haven't used since I got in here. Oh, congratulations. Yeah, did they, uh, throw a party for ya? How you doin'? I'm fine. Oh. Well, what are you gonna do when you get out of here? I don't know. I'll think of something. I'm always resourceful. I want you to come stay with me. - Really? - Yeah. OK. OK. I'll... I'll do it. Thanks. I'm glad you're my brother. I'm glad you're my brother. We, uh, set up a room for you. Wow. This is really great. - I don't know what to say. - Oh, no problem. Uh, dinner's at 7:00 sharp. Adam likes to eat on time. OK. I'm really grateful. Adam's orders. So just let me know if you need anything, and I'll be in the kitchen. - OK. - OK. Doctor, your glove. Let me get you another one. Doctor? Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just tired. - You don't look OK. - I'm fine. Adam, can I, uh, can I speak to you outside in the hallway for a second? No, all right? Now just... put the patient under. Something's wrong. We have to talk about this at some point. Yeah, well, you know what? I don't want to. Hi, Max. Hi. You sure you're all right? Yeah. OK. Why don't you swing by the hospital tomorrow around noon? We can have lunch together. OK. All right. - I'll see ya tomorrow. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. I'm here to meet my brother, Dr. Adam Verbinski. OK. - Hey, Adam. - Max, what are you doin' here? - You said we were going to lunch. - Doctor. - I did? - Yeah. I don't know what I was thinking. I'm not even hungry. - What are you doin'? - I'm working. So, what, you don't wanna go? - Adam? It's over, son. - Can I help you? - Dr. Verbinski? - Yes. I'm Lieutenant Lally. I have a warrant for your arrest. They showed me this tape. Your privileges are suspended. These gentlemen will escort you from the premises. I'm not going anywhere. Get out of my office! - Turn around. Take it easy. - Get the fuck away from me! - Get off me! - Dr. Verbinski, please. - Open your hands! - What's goin' on?! Where you takin' him? Find myself a pretty lady... ...big home, nice car, baby. I don't know. It's not really that important right now. Lotta work to do. You got work to do? Yeah, I got work to do. So do you. Get your shit together. You're this close, man. - What? - What? What do you mean, "this close"? I said, "You're this close. " To what? To gettin' your shit together. Think Mom... really misses me? Course she does. She loves you. Hey! Hey, sorry I'm late, man. What happened? My license has been suspended. I can't practice medicine for two years. Oh, man. Plus, Jo kicked me out. I'm sorry. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Well, if you want, you can come stay at my apartment till you figure it out. I mean, it ain't much, but... I got a job. I'm movin' on up. - Let me show it to you right now. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - You're welcome to stay there. - Great. Hey, I've matured since the last time. - I've matured. - I don't know. Come on. Look, let me take care of you for a while. We'll go to meetings together. We'll be just a couple of geniuses hanging out. - Maybe. - Ha. - I just know that I'm very humble. - Humble, my ass! I'm just proud of how humble I am, that's all. You should be humble. # Turn the lights down # Come to me # Trouble's gone now # As far as I can see # Let the healing begin # Let the pain escape # Comfort settles in # Takes the worry away
