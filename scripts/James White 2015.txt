He wanted to know if you have the copy test'? No, but can I just maybe email it to him later? Yeah, absolutely. All right. Can you do me a favor? Just give this to him'? Unless, he doesn't have to read it all, but it's just to get him started. Sure. Just a couple things. I'll let him know. Can you do me one more favor actually? Can you just charge my phone? My phone died. Maybe I'll just grab it when I'm leaving? Yeah. That cool'? I can plug it in. I really appreciate it. I'll be out in a few. Maggie, right'? Yes. Thank you. Yo. (Ben) Hey, there he is. You guys need anything? No, we're good. Thank you. Thank you. She is beautiful. What's your shirt say'? It says "Let's verb together." It's a little wordplay. What did you do to your hand? Oh, nothing, a stupid accident. Got to be careful with that. Yeah. Um, so, I looked at your pages. What I read I really liked. It's, uh... Yeah? It's good. It's sad. Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, that's actually something I just wrote really quick and I wanted you to have the full experience of reading it in my actual handwriting. I had it. I really like how you drew the characters. And I think you really captured your dad's voice. Whatever, it's just a story though. Yeah, I remember when I lost my dad. I was kind of a mess. Takes a while to process that. Yes. You know? Yeah, but you know, I mean, I feel like I'm dealing with it. I'm actually really just so excited to start working. So, what do you think'? What can I do'? What do you think I'd be doing here? I'm sorry. Can I get you some coffee or something to drink? Did you... Some water'? No, I got water. You sure I? Yeah. [phone rings] One sec. Hello. No, tell him I'll call him back. [hangs up] Um... You remind me a lot of me. And your dad, you know. I loved your dad. And I love your mom. And I'm hereto help. I want to help. So I'm just going to come right out and say this. Um... I wouldn't feel comfortable hiring you for anything right now. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I understand. Um... But I really need this right now. Well, if that's true, then I'm really glad this meeting's with me and not somebody else. Because if you showed up without an assignment that you were asked to prepare, and the writing sample that you presented like this, you have a gash on your hand and you smell the way that you smell at 10 AM they would've stopped you at the elevator. You're a mess. Um" I mean, I know the demons that you're wrestling with and I know how hard they are to get rid of. Yeah, here's the thing. Like, I'm okay. That's not... I think... I really think we're having some kind of misunderstanding about this. That's okay. I think you are going to be okay. Okay. So here's what we're going to do. You're going to take whatever you need, a month or two, and when you feel like you've got your head on straight, you're going to call me and well! Try this again, all right'? Except let's get lunch next time. Yeah? Okay. All right. Here, I'll walk you out. Okay. Hey, Genie. How are you'? (Gail) Hey! How's it going? (Gail) I would come give you a hug but my legs are hurting. Okay. Her energy's down, but now that you're here. I'm coming to you. Hey. Come to me. [laughs] [kiss] Aw. Did you eat anything? I had some apple sauce. I'm not really hungry. Okay, I'm off. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. See you. [door opens and closes] So how are you, my love'? All right. Yeah. You don't look so good.
