JOHN: It's my job to market this drug for Bristol-Myers, and I'm telling you, kids won't go for it unless it tastes like bubble gum. Mr. Crowley, you're late. All right. Thank you. Bye. AILEEN: "Everyone just walked by. "'Why won't anyone buy our newspaper?' SpongeBob wondered aloud. "'They must be rock haters, ' said Patrick." MEGAN: John! Give it back to me! JOHN JR.: She's mine now! Give me a minute, okay? Give it back to me, John! You save our spot. Got it? You better give me back my Fiona! Help, Mom! Help me! She's trying to kill me! I'm gonna get you! You can't escape! No! Mom, help me! (GIGGLES) Just give it back to me. Mom! She's trying to kill me! Megan Kathryn Crowley. If you kill your brother, you cannot have your party. Why not? He stole Fiona. I didn't steal her, I kidnapped her. I'm holding her for ransom. Release the victim. (GRUNTS) Time to get ready for your party. JOHN: We've got to get moving on the product launch. PETE ON PHONE: I'm just waiting on legal, John. Damn it! I just missed my train. I'm gonna have to call you... I agree. How soon do you need it? As soon as possible. I'm presenting to my boss next week. AILEEN: John, we're loading up the van right now. Come on! Okay, we ready to roll, Kate? My name is Jane. Kate was yesterday, Mom. Oh, I am so sorry. The way the agency shuffles day nurses on us, you'd think they'd, you know, give you a number instead of a name. Mmm-hmm. Okay, John. John, come on, get your butt in the car. John. Are you bringing your RipStik? Yes. Do you have to? Yes. JOHN: ...a pain, that's why. Wait, I gotta catch a cab. Hi. Come here. Hey, hey. Hello? Daddy's meeting us there, right? AILEEN: Absolutely. I am sure he has everything under control. JOHN: Taxi! DRIVER: You need a hand? Great. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm kind of in a hurry. Go. Come on, come on, come on... (KIDS CHEERING) Yes! KIDS: Yes! He totally promised he'd be here by now. He's on his way, baby. He's on his way. ALL: Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Megan Hi, guys. (LAUGHING) Get in there and give her a kiss. I know. I don't wanna hear it... Go, go, go. Happy birthday. I made it. Yay! ALL: Yay! Make a wish, Megan. (KIDS CHEERING) Who wants cake? KIDS: I do! Line up single file, or no cake for you. All right, how many do we have? I'm first! Me first! No, I'm the big guy. GIRL: Back to the end of the line. So, where is Fiona going, anyway? Lollipop Land? I'm 8, Daddy. I'm not a baby anymore. She's driving to Antarctica to see the penguins. Really? That's pretty far away. Why doesn't she just go to the Portland Zoo? They have a lot of penguins there, too. Haven't you ever heard of adventure? Yeah. It's gonna take her years. Oh? Won't she need a suitcase? It's an adventure. You don't need a suitcase on an adventure. Well, I don't know about you, but if I was going on an adventure, I would take a suitcase. That's 'cause you're a businessman. That's right. I am. And you're 8 years old. And happy birthday. And I love you. Love you, too, Daddy. Good night. See you in the morning. Good night. Nighty-night. Sweet dreams. Good night, Dad. Good night, Daddy. Night, buddy. (PHONE RINGING) (TRUCKIN' PLAYING) One of these days they know they gotta get goin' Out of the door and down on the street all alone Truckin', like the do-dah man Once told me "You've got to play your hand" Sometimes the cards ain't worth a damn If you don't lay 'em down (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Hello? JOHN ON PHONE: Hello, Dr. Stonehill? Are you there? Hello? Yeah. This is John Crowley. I don't know if you've gotten any of my messages. Who? John... Jesus. I'm interested in speaking with you. I understand from many researchers... having a conversation with you if that's convenient. Is this a good time to talk? Dr. Stonehill? Hello? Asshole. "Asshole?" AILEEN: The night nurse just left. What time is it? I missed you. This is pathetic. I'm still dressed. I could help you with that. Oh? (AILEEN MOANING) Oh my...Kate! Hi! You're early. You're early. Have you met... I'm John Crowley. John is my husband. Glad to hear it. JOHN: Mmm-hmm. (MECHANICAL BEEPING) AILEEN: Yeah, let's up her breathing treatments today. What's going on? Just a cold. She's awfully congested. Call the doc just to be on the safe side? AILEEN: Yeah, I left word. Sweetie? I'm gonna go to work, okay? Feel better. Bye-bye. PETE: We're already doing great marketing the drug to physicians. It's our direct marketing to patients we need to beef up. Mr. Crowley, I'm really sorry. Aileen's on the line, she really needs to speak to you. Okay, thank you. I'm just gonna... Hey. We're at the hospital. The doc wants Megan under observation. Is she all right? Just keep your cell with you. Okay. Can I do something? I'll call you when I know more. I should really get back to Megan, so I'll call you as soon as I know anything, okay? Bye. Love you. Excuse me, please. WOMAN: Sir? My daughter, Megan Crowley, was brought in for observation. Yeah. Actually, they're moving her to the ICU. Where? That way. Aileen. John. Has she told you about the trip that Fiona's taking with her remote-controlled car? Yeah, yes, she did. You're right. That's right, sweetie. You're gonna see all the penguins, aren't you? She might send some postcards or something like that. Lots of good stuff to see along the way... It's okay. like icebergs and maybe a polar bear. How about some seals? DR. PRESTON: As you know, Pompe patients suffer muscle deterioration in every part of the body, so this sort of respiratory complication, well, that's just an inevitable fact of the disease. Mr. Crowley, Mrs. Crowley, Megan is not responding well. Okay? Now, we've done everything we can, but she's just... There's nothing more we can do. I'm sorry. As you know, she was already well past the life expectancy, for, you know, Pompe kids. After all, it's not just her lungs, okay? Her heart, her liver, these organs have been compromised and would've become fatally enlarged. Now, I wish that we had a drug to treat Pompe, but we simply don't. I'm so very sorry. Look, maybe... Maybe you can find some small comfort in knowing that Megan's suffering will be over. Maybe you can see this as a blessing. (WHEEZING) (ALARM BEEPING) Megan? Help! Help! Help! AILEEN: Megan? JOHN: Help! Help! Baby girl, can you hear me? Please, someone come help! NURSE 1: 321! Megan Crowley, room 321, please! Code Blue! Baby girl, Mama's here, all right? Let's go! Page Dr. Heder. NURSE 1: Asystole! Yeah, right through here. AILEEN: Can you hear my voice? Can you hear Mama? DOCTOR 1: Starting compressions. NURSE 2: I'll switch her out. Over here, please quickly. AILEEN: Hang in there, Megan. Hang in there, baby, okay? I need to bag her. JOHN: Aileen? Some room right there. DOCTOR 2: Let us in, all right? Please, Mrs. Crowley, let... Stop it! Let us help her! Please... Megan! Aileen. DOCTOR 2: Epinephrine, 0.1 mils per kig. NURSE 1: Got it. DOCTOR 1: Still no pulse. No reading. Forget the weight, come on, get it in there! Aileen, Aileen. NURSE 1: 0.1 epi. It's all right. Come on, Megs. Come on. Come on. IV push. DOCTOR 1: Okay, just give the epi a couple seconds. NURSE 1: Still non-responsive. All right, charge the defib. NURSE 3: Charging. Your daughter is some fighter. She's gonna be okay. Oh, my God. Now, look, she's still a very sick girl, obviously, but her vital signs have improved and I'm cautiously optimistic. So, I guess you could say we dodged that blessing, huh? Mrs. Crowley, these came for Megan. Thanks so much. Thank you. PETE: Hey, John? Huh? Any time you're ready, man. You gonna tell us about the product launch? John, you okay? I have to go. John. Where you going? Nebraska. Excuse me, please. There's a gentleman here to see you. Best make yourself comfortable, hon. Oh, dear. Sir, sir. That's Dr. Stonehill. He just left, I'm sorry. Thank you. Yeah. Dr. Stonehill! Hey, Dr. Stonehill! (SPORTSCASTERS CHATTERING ON TV) Dr. Stonehill? Yeah? I'm John Crowley. Okay. Didn't you get any of my messages? What messages? I left you 3 or 4 messages in the last month, and you even hung up on me the night before last. What the hell are you talking about? I never hung up on you. Dr. Stonehill, Oh, Jesus. Well, I'm sorry. A terrible disease, but, hell, you shouldn't have come all this way without talking to me. I do research, son. I don't see patients. Well, it's your research that I'm interested in. I've read all the journal articles on Pompe disease, and all the researchers out there say that your work holds the most promise. Get to the point, son. What do you want from me? We almost lost my daughter last week. I need to hear about your research. STONEHILL: Your kids have a genetic disease. They're missing an enzyme which metabolizes a certain kind of sugar, glycogen. It's defective in Pompe patients. So, this sugar builds up in the muscle cells, especially in the heart, the skeletal muscles, the diaphragm, which is why they have a hard time breathing. Yeah, I know. I know a lot about that. Everybody's making an enzyme, but you can infuse kids all day long with their enzyme, and it's not gonna do any good 'cause it's not gonna get into their cells. Understand what I'm saying? Yeah, so that means that if you put the sugar... Don't interrupt. Sorry. I'm making a different version of this enzyme. My enzyme has a biological marker, mannose 6-phosphate. I'm the only one that's cloned the gene for phosphotransferase. I'm the only one who's cloned the gene for uncovering enzyme, so I can get more mannose 6-phosphate onto the lysosomal protein, and I can deliver a more effective amount of enzyme into the cells. That's why people are citing my work. That's why you read my name in the literature. I can get more enzyme into the cells. What's the matter, Sal? Not up on your glycobiology? I thought Doc was just your nickname. No, that man's a genius. He's on the verge of a scientific breakthrough. Wow. Who knew? I'm not on the verge of anything, kid. This is a theory, not a therapy. I'm just an academic. You got any idea how shitty my funding is? No. University of Nebraska pays their football coach more money in a year than my entire science budget. Nobody's paying attention to this work. Half my grants don't get approved. I don't have the money to make my theory into a useable medicine. How old are your kids? Look, do yourself a favor. Go home and spend time with your kids. Enjoy 'em while they're still here. How much? How much what? How much money would it take to prove your theory, to create your version of the medicine? I'd need half a million bucks just to fund the lab work. That's why you need me. I need you? Why? Because I'm the founder of the Pompe Foundation for Children. I've been working on this disease for 10 years. I have never heard of you guys. That's because we're relatively new. We're just in the gearing-up phase. How soon do you need a grant? Now would be good. Well, not all the money's in place, but it will be, and soon. This is a very exciting time. JOHN: Thanks. DRIVER: Thank you, sir. Have a good day. Hey. You okay? Did you get my messages? Your messages? You suddenly walk out of the meeting and fly to Nebraska without talking to me about it, and you think messages make it okay? I'm sorry. My God, John. I wanna find a miracle as much as you do, okay? But how could you put your job in jeopardy? Aileen. How exactly do we pay $40,000 a month in healthcare if you lose your insurance? Honey, come on. Look, I'm not gonna lose my job. Oh, really? Pete called here twice last night to ask if you were okay. You know, mentally. (SCOFFS) I'll just... I'll call, and I'll smooth that one over. Yeah, no shit. (SIGHS) I'm sorry. Something in me just kind of snapped. That night at the hospital, when we thought that we were losing her, I prayed that if it was her time, she'd go quickly, without so much suffering. But morning came, and she pulled through. Her eyes, so determined, so defiant. The fight in her. (SIGHS) Was he worth it? This Stonehill guy? He's really eccentric, but his science is way ahead of everybody else's. He's definitely the one to put our money on. (CHUCKLES) If we had any. I promised him that we'd raise some, because he's got this conference up here next month, and I said I'd have a check ready for him. How much? That's all? Thousand. Is it $500 or $1,000? $500,000. By next month. (CHUCKLES) Sweetheart, are you totally insane? Apparently. AILEEN: We're holding our first fundraiser on the 23rd at the school, and we would love if you and Frank could join us. Ready for your spelling test? I'm gonna nail it. Okay. Good luck. My name's John Crowley. I'm calling from Oregon, and I got your name from the Atlanta-area Pompe parents' group. Yeah. AILEEN: And I was so sorry not to see you at the reunion because you were one of my most favorite people in high school. (CHUCKLES) Anyway, John and I are starting this foundation. Hey, Dad? Dad. No, you know what I mean. Just make it right. Dad? Can't you see I'm on the phone? Okay, well, tell me he told you. Dad! No, I'm gonna have to call you back. I can't talk. All right, bye. Yeah, what is it? I sold my RipStik. Okay. Is it enough to give to Megan and Patrick's foundation? Yeah, it's more than enough. Are you John? Yes. Marcus Temple. We spoke on the phone. Right. Absolutely. Good to see you. All the way in from Atlanta. Yes. Well, this is for your foundation, from my relatives, friends and church group. Oh! My goodness. (MARCUS CHUCKLES) JOHN: Thank you very much. Thanks. Hi, Dr. Stonehill. I'm Megan. Hi, Megan. I'm Dr. Stonehill. Yeah, that's why I said, "Hi, Dr. Stonehill." Are you coming in or not? Yeah, thanks. Where's Mom and Dad? They'll be down in a minute. Patrick's vent alarm is going off, so they need to fix it. His alarm goes off even more than mine. So, what's your deal? You married? Do you have a wife? Uh, ex-wives. 2 of 'em. Yeah? How come? 'Cause I'm so easy to get along with. Any other questions? No. Your turn to ask one. You're probably wondering what grade I'm in. What grade are you in? I'm in 3rd. My hobbies are video games and penguins. How about you? I already graduated. No, I mean hobbies. Oh... Mostly I just work. Little bass fishing every once in a while, but... What's your favorite subject? I'm good at reading, but I like P.E. best, especially the sprint races. Sprint races? Wanna see? Sure. Come on. Is he here yet? I don't know. I'm gonna win! Come on, slowpoke. Yeah, I won! (CHUCKLES) I won. Oh, yeah. Told you I'm gonna beat you. Hi. Dr. Stonehill has 2 ex-wives. I see that Megan's introduced herself. Yeah. How are you, Dr. Stonehill? I'm okay, thank you. This is Aileen, my wife. So nice to meet you. And John Jr. Hello. Here's Patrick. Hi. Hey, Patrick. I think we should probably go inside. AILEEN: Yeah, come on inside. Megan, we'll see you inside. Come on. Night, Patrick. Good night. Night, SpongeBob. You gotta say good night to Dr. Stonehill. Kiss SpongeBob. (SQUEAKS) Good night. Good night, son. Good night, Patrick. I'm not gonna say it again. It is bedtime now. It's for him. AILEEN: Oh. Me? For good luck. For bass fishing. Oh, thank you. You like it? Well, sure. A happy-go-lucky little fellow, lots of personality, huh? He's a plastic toy. I know. JOHN: Here's the father-daughter dance. You haven't lived until you've seen Megan do the Wheelchair Watusi. Here you go. Go ahead and eat the cobbler while it's hot. Smells great, honey. (LAUGHS) This was hilarious. Bob, we went to this dude ranch. All right if I call you Bob? You got a check for a half-million dollars, hell, you can call me Peggy Sue. (CHUCKLES) I'll just... Well, Bob. This is the first installment against the promised half a million. Tell you the truth, that's more than I expected. Dr. Stonehill, we promise that... Yeah, I know. If... In enough time, then... I know. I know. You can learn a lot about a person on the Internet these days. Learn about a working-class kid from New Jersey, worked his way through Harvard Business School, clawing his way up the ladder at Bristol-Myers. But what Google can't tell you is that this scared, desperate, bullshitting son of a bitch... Wait just a minute... Don't interrupt. Will do and say whatever it takes to get results. Which is why you and me are going into business together, Jersey. Excuse me? I'm tired of begging breadcrumbs from the university and giving them the patents to my ideas. They don't value my work. You do, which is why I'm setting up my own shop. Figure any dude in a business suit can help me raise venture capital and run the company, but who's gonna be half as motivated as a dad who's trying to save his own kids? So, this is... So this is the shittiest offer you're ever gonna get. I can promise you less money, longer hours, lousy working conditions, plus, if we raise the money, you're gonna have to relocate to Nebraska. (SCOFFS) Oh, and with the right business plan, I can also promise you a working enzyme for Pompe disease. I can't cure your kids, you know that. They're always gonna be in wheelchairs, but I think I can save their lives. Outstanding cobbler. AILEEN: Okay, okay. So, we agree we can't uproot the kids. What if Stonehill fails? Or what if he succeeds too late to help Megs and Patrick? Then what? I know. If we're gonna lose them young, you want to spend every minute you can with them. John, that day that you flew to Nebraska, when you suddenly just ditched work and... My God, I thought you'd lost it. You scared me. But once we rolled our sleeves up, and we started fundraising and meeting other Pompe families, it made me feel like... I mean, do we just accept our fate and do what we're told by all the well-meaning doctors and wait for the worst to happen, or do we fight it? PETE: I think you're making a mistake. I really do. Even if you were credible as a CEO, which you are not, the odds against you are crushing. biotechs crash and burn. So where does that leave your kids when their dad is flat broke with no job and no health insurance? Now, if you stay at Bristol, the guys upstairs are ready to put you in the VP slot at the end of the 3rd quarter with a 40% salary bump. John. Your family's gonna need that money, aren't they? Pete, you're right. This is crazy. I'm chasing the wind. But I can't just sit around and wait for my kids to die. I can't do it. AUTOMATED VOICE: You have arrived at your destination. Come on in. It's open. Hey, there, Bob. Hey, John. How are you? You have trouble finding me? No problem. Sit down. Thanks. Ex-wife. She loved cats. Well, say, what do we... What are we gonna do? How about we work up a strategy for the meeting at Renzler next week? We don't need to show those guys anything. The meeting's a formality. George Renzler and I have known each other since med school. He's been telling me for years that he'd give me the seed money if I ever decide to make the big move and set up my own shop. Well, that's good. That's good, but, still, all the same, you know, if we're gonna go in to pitch 'em, we should have something tangible. Those guys understand me. They're real scientists. They're not like a lot of these big biotech moneymen. Okay. All right, tell you what, how about if we just talk it through, and then that way we can just sketch up something rough on paper? You give it to me, I'll make up a business plan. JOHN: We need to rough out a real strategy. These guys are venture capitalists. That rough enough for you? Bob? Look, Renzler's crucial to us. Without them onboard, we got zero credibility with any of our investors. That's why you're here, Jersey! Whip up some business bullshit by tomorrow. I'm going fishing. This is... This is gibberish! Then you better get busy. See you. JOHN: As you know, the market potential for an orphan drug is enormous. If you were still in business school, I'd give you an A for all these lovely charts and graphs and... But school is out. Most of us here are scientists. We need to see the science. Bob, make us believe. Love to, George. (INAUDIBLE) ...the phosphotransferase and the 2nd uncovering enzyme... STONEHILL: At this point, the challenge is to scale up this process to produce kilogram quantities of HPGAA. And the question is whether or not it's cost-effective to contract this work out or to build our own manufacturing facility. Either way, we're gonna eventually need an investment on the order of $10 million. It's a lot of information in a short period of time. Does anybody have any questions? This is astonishing. STONEHILL: Well, thank you, George. This man is light years ahead of the field. (CHUCKLES) Okay. Well, why don't you have your money guys get together with John and work out the business... Sounds great. Of course, we'll need you to explain some of the mundane stuff, Bob, the nuts and bolts. Nuts and bolts? What... RENZLER: Yeah. You're a brilliant theoretician, but you've never actually brought a new drug to market before, right? No, I've never brought a drug to market. I haven't. (CLEARS THROAT) I mean, for example, how are you getting the phosphotransferase? I'm purifying it out of a lactating bovine udder. I see. And where are you getting the udders? From the stockyards. Pretty straightforward stuff. Not really. You can't inject cow protein into people. I know that. The bovine version of the enzyme is for lab work, for proof of concept. I'll make a copy of the human enzyme for actual drug trials. What about uncovering enzyme? What about it? How exactly do you plan on making an exact replica? I'm making it in T-293, out of human kidney cells. Oh, my goodness. No. "Oh, my goodness. No?" No. The FDA will never allow that. Hey, Bob, just... Wait a second. For Christ's sake, we will change the cell line before clinical trials. You've gotta have that process locked down long, long before you think about... Bob, why don't we just take a coffee break... Why are you talking to me this way? I don't want any goddamn coffee. Bob, can you just tell us how you're planning to make the 3 enzymes under FDA-approved GMP in... I'm not here to cross every "t" and dot every "i", George. And I'm not here to be poked and prodded like a 1st-year med student. This is ridiculous. Bob. This is bullshit. RENZLER: Bob. Bob, if you can't answer a question, you say you're working out the details. You don't storm out on these guys like some sort of spoiled child, okay? Now, we're gonna go back in there. No, I'm not going back in there. We're going back in there. This is business, Bob. It's not personal. That was personal. Stonehill goes and completely sabotages the meeting. Thank you. I mean, he completely blew my plan, right out of the gate. Okay, I get that he's a loose cannon, but do you still believe in his science? Honey, if I don't raise $10 million in capital, his science doesn't matter. At all. What's going on with his arm? Hey, buddy, you okay? You all right? I can't throw them anymore. When did this happen? I don't know. You should help him, Daddy. That's a good idea. Okay, here we go. You ready? Into the water. That was a good shot. We can do better than that. Try again. Let's make, like, a little pellet. Here, ducky, ducky. (ALL LAUGHING) Let's do it again. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Give me another piece, John. (CHUCKLING) Oh. I can just throw them. And you do all the laughing, and I'll do all the throwing. JOHN: That's good, the ducky shared. Did you see that? PATRICK: Yeah. John? We're out of time. I know. He doesn't have the strength to throw a piece of bread to a duck. It scares the hell out of me. Me, too. John, what are you doing? I'm offering Renzler a deal he can't turn down. Excuse me. Morning. Dr. Renzler? Dr. Renzler? Sir, good morning. John Crowley. Crowley? Yes, sir. What are you doing here? Good morning. Good morning. I understand from your secretary that you're going to be leaving for France for a month. That's right. I have a proposal for you, and I was hopeful that you could take a look at it. We're running late for a flight. I appreciate that. It'll only take a second, just to have a quick read. Fine. I'll read it in the car. It might interest you. Good, thank you. Does Stonehill know about this? Of course. And he's okay with these terms? All I need is your signature. Hello? I just need some place Where I can lay my head Bob. Bob. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) JOHN: Bob! Over here. Bob. Ow! Bob! (THE WEIGHT PLAYING) Hi. Bob. What'd you do to yourself? I got the investment from Renzler. You what? Listen, I want you to think about something before you read that. What the hell is this? Under the circumstances, this is the best deal that we could ever get. This isn't a deal. This is the terms of our surrender, for... Renzler comes in for a couple million now, and you give him the option of jumping in as a full partner later? Well, after sabotaging our meeting, I had to do something dramatic. And you promise him we'll be in clinical trials in a year? We can do this, Bob. All right? We work harder, we push ourselves, we work around the clock. I already work around the clock! Why don't you just give 'em my balls in a jelly jar? There's no other way I could get them to come back to the table. Who needs the bastards anyway! Without Renzler, there's no reason for us to even think about other venture groups. Fine! Then I won't think about other venture groups! Great! Spend the rest of your life dreaming up great ideas that don't get funded. Draw brilliant diagrams on the wall that cure diseases in theory, but never help a single human being in reality. What'd you do? Let me see it. It's just barely... Let me see. Put pressure on it. Got your blood all over this thing. Want me to add a drop of mine, make it official? Or would a signature suffice? Bob? (THE WEIGHT CONTINUES PLAYING) I picked up my bag I went lookin' for a place to hide When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown." She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around" Take a load off, Fanny Take a load for free I'm not paying a dollar more than 22,000 a unit, okay? I'm not doing it. Hi, Bob. These guys make me feel old. Scientists get all sensible and careful when they get old. Young ones like risk, not afraid of new ideas, and you can pay 'em less. We all believe in Bob Stonehill's bold vision, otherwise you wouldn't be here. But to reach clinical trials inside of a year, I'm gonna have to ask you to commit to a brutal schedule. Ladies and gentlemen, reset your watches to Priozyme Time. How long? Well, if you can get it any quicker, that'd be good. NILES: I'll try. MAN: Come on. STONEHILL: Vinh, check the breakers. VINH: Got it. (SWITCH CLICKING) VINH: No, the whole building's out. Well, get the backup generator going. We... Wait, wait, wait. STONEHILL: You never bothered to buy a backup generator? We're in the middle of tornado country, for Christ's sake! Yeah, so I'm a meteorologist? If I don't have my refrigeration back in 45 minutes, I lose the whole cell line. It was never in the budget. We never had the money for it. I'm sorry, sir. Your card, it's been denied. What? It got maxed out. I bought the roller bottle unit for the lab. Shit, I... Just pay me back by the end of the month, or I lose my apartment. Hi, here you go. Thanks. Yes! Yes! DRIVER: Sir. Thank you. Fiona's in Mexico this week. They've got pyramids there. Mmm-hmm. She's still got lots of things to see before she gets to Antarctica. Yeah. She's gonna chop up all the penguins with an ax. And feed their bloody remains to the walruses. I see. What? Every time you come home for the weekend, you don't even listen to me. Megs. You know what, you're right. I'm sorry. It's just that I've been so busy trying to make the special medicine for you and Patrick. I want it pink. You want what? The special medicine. I want it to be pink. Okay. I guess I can ask Dr. Stonehill. Tell him dark pink, like this. Not light pink. That's for babies. Okay. SCIENTIST: Here you go. Dr. Renzler, be reasonable. The company is only 6 months old, and we are making great progress towards in vivo testing. I don't know. The way the company is burning money... Well, we've got to get a leg up on the competition. You know that Zymagen has far more spending power than we do. So, what you're saying, I should have invested in Zymagen. No, what I'm saying is, is that we've got to beat 'em to the punch. Either that, or scare them into buying us out. Well, you're scaring us investors a hell of a lot more than you're scaring Zymagen. You sell the company to Zymagen, you're in clinical trials by the end of the fiscal year, or we pull the plug and cut our losses. Goodbye. Hello? This construct's looking pretty good, but we gotta get better cleavage between the alpha and the beta subunits. Well, what if we add a furin site like the one in uncovering enzyme? Why would you wanna do that? Doesn't it have its own... We need to talk. I'm busy. You're always busy. You always wanna talk. Yeah, we could add furin and try and cleave it before purification. (CLEARS THROAT) What are you doing? Giving you a preview... Guys, would you excuse us for a minute? of what's going to happen if we are not in clinical trials in 4 months. Our investors will turn out the lights. Science takes time, Jersey. Don't they understand? Yeah, they do. They can read the Wall Street Journal. They see that Zymagen is testing They're testing 3 'cause they don't know what the hell they're doing. I'm testing one 'cause it's the right one! I know. I believe you, Bob. Why else do you think I put up with all your shit? Look. I want you to go toe-to-toe with Zymagen's scientists. Prove to them that your enzyme is best. I can do that. That's the reason I've entered into conversations with them to buy our company. You're telling me? You're not asking me? Oh, come on, Bob. I am just being fiscally responsible. Nobody is gonna tell me how to run my lab! If I can engineer a deal, and that is a really big "if," you're going to have to forgive me for all the money I'm gonna make you. I don't care about money. I'm a scientist. I care about more important things than that. Don't you tell me about more important things to care about. Do the math. Either we sell the company and get a huge cash infusion, or the investors will shut us down. Where you going? I'm gonna go take a crap, if that meets with your fiscal approval. What, they can't drive from the airport like ordinary people? Bob, we need to make this happen. They're gonna ask us some tough questions. Don't take 'em personally, all right? All right? STONEHILL: These lab results confirm what I've been preaching for years, that phosphorylation is key to enzyme absorption. My theory works for Pompe, and eventually it'll work for enzyme replacement therapies for other lysosomal storage disorders. Is it too complicated? Too complicated? The number of variables built into your approach are mind-boggling. I mean, Jesus, if you get even one piece wrong in the synthesis, just one carbohydrate ends up in the wrong position... Well, it's gotta be done right, like anything worth doing. You've never actually gotten a drug approved. Isn't it naive to think you can solve these kinds of manufacturing challenges? (MOUTHING) You're right, I'm a theory guy. My head is in the clouds. Which is why we need you. Unless, of course, your reputation for solving protein-manufacturing problems is undeserved. (CHUCKLES) Nice one. I still need to hear about profitability. JOHN: Certainly, certainly. As you know, this is not a one-time treatment. It's a lifelong therapy. And these patients, they are going to generate revenue over the span of their lifetime that is... But even if you make a usable enzyme, clearly it won't work for all patients. So, what survival rate do we need to achieve a robust profit? What rate of patient death can be defined as acceptable loss? Acceptable loss? I understand the question. Because the profit margins on this orphan drug are so incredibly high, the... Even with a mortality rate of, say, 25% over 5 years still indicates that there is a highly lucrative revenue source to be realized. Gentlemen, we have a deal. Dr. Robert Stonehill to see Barry Renee. GUARD: I have a Dr. Robert Stonehill to see Dr. Renee. Sir, you need to be cleared. I'm just gonna use the restroom. You need to be cleared to do that, sir. Just need to... You need a security badge. Jesus. Well, can I have a security badge so I can go take a pee? Yes, sir. He will give that to you. Hey, Bob. Hey, John. You getting comfortable? Define "comfortable." You haven't cashed it yet? I haven't earned it yet. I'll cash it when we have a usable enzyme. Well, it sure is beautiful. (KIDS SHOUTING) It sure is big. The kids love it. Seize the day. Okay. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) I'm stuck on this call. Just wanted to let you know how thrilled we are to have you onboard, John. It's an honor. You remember Dr. Kent Webber. Of course. It's good to see you again. Good to see you, too. I'll let the 2 of you get into it. I'm expecting great things. Yes, sir. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) I've got some pretty good ideas about how to help the flow of information between the 4 core enzyme groups. Whoa, John, slow down. That's not our established procedure. Pardon me? The 4 core teams are essentially in competition with each other. It's an entrepreneurial model. It works. I'm all for competition, but surely there must be some channel for allowing sharing scientific insights that can help develop all 4 enzymes. John, in the interest of saving us time, let me be blunt. Most of the scientists here don't like the idea of having a non-scientist as senior VP of the Pompe program. Especially one whose objectivity might be clouded by having children with the disease. I'm telling you this in your own best interests. Erich wanted to buy Stonehill's ideas, and he couldn't do that without also swallowing you as part of the pill. My advice to you, John, is to keep your head down. Thank you for that wisdom. You're very welcome. SCIENTIST: All of your lab notebooks must be submitted to the review committee! STONEHILL: This is my lab now! Get out! I'm just trying to explain the protocol! STONEHILL: You're wasting my time. Dr. Stonehill... Shoo! Fine. Shoo. What do you want? I just dropped by to say that I think that we might be missing an opportunity to open a dialogue with the other 3 core teams. The other core teams? Core teams. Core bullshit. I'll come back another time. DR. WALDMAN: The decline in muscle strength is very troubling, of course, but it's really, in both kids, the organ enlargement, the liver, and especially the heart, that's the real threat to their lives. We'll continue to monitor the rate of cardiac enlargement. We'll keep tabs on their other organs... How long? I don't like to predict. JOHN: Please. Dr. Waldman, we won't hold you to it. We just need to know something. John. How much more time do we have? How long? Well, if there's another respiratory crisis, all bets are off, but otherwise, Megan, maybe a year. Patrick, less. Thank you. (PHONE RINGING) WENDY: Marcus. Hmm? Get the phone. What? The phone. Who is it? MARCUS: Hello? Hi. Is that Marcus? Yeah, yeah. What time is it? Yeah, I'm sorry. It's late. It's John Crowley. John, what you doin'? You okay? (SIGHS) Hey, look, I gotta ask you a favor. Morning, Gavin. Morning, sir. Is my 11:00 with Henessey confirmed? Yes, and there's the breakfast meeting down in the cafeteria. Breakfast meeting? There was an e-mail that came in over the weekend. Everyone on the Pompe project was invited. Who called the meeting? Mr. Crowley, I believe, sir. What? AILEEN: Um, something that people ask me all the time is how we have 2 kids with Pompe. By the time we realized that Megan had Pompe, I was already pregnant with Patrick. I mean, I can't tell you how many doctors we saw, and the message was always the same, that there is no drug to treat Pompe. But thanks to you, all of you, that message is changing. What you've given us, and a lot of other families, is hope. So, thank you. Good job, Aileen. Now I'd like to welcome the Temple family, who've come all the way from Georgia to be with us here today. Thanks, John. Hi. I'm Marcus. This is my wife, Wendy. Our daughter Lauren, our oldest daughter, Lauren wanted to come today and say hi to all you guys. She's a little weak, but she wanted us to show you guys her picture and to send you her love. And this is our daughter, Megan. The most beautiful girls are named Megan. Megan is 4 months old, and you can't see it yet, but she has Pompe, too. I... I can't tell you what it means to us to have all of you working on a medicine for our children. Thank you. Thanks so much. Hey, Kent. John. JOHN: So what did you think of the event? In medical research, John, objectivity is key. If researchers get all emotional, all desperate to help suffering patients, they'll cut corners. It's counterproductive. Counterproductive is having working together on the same disease, but not talking to each other. Most of these guys have never even seen a kid with Pompe before. I don't see how that's relevant. Did you see Erich? That's the kind of motivation that we need. I'm gonna ask him to get the core team to stop competing, start working together. Create a leadership team. Well, if you hope to sell this leadership team idea, there's only one way to convince Erich. And what's that? Keep your guy, Stonehill, off the team. In his short tenure here, he's managed to alienate a remarkable number of colleagues. You can't put him on a team that's supposed to build cooperation. So, decide how badly you want your leadership team, then do what you have to do. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) That's it. Dr. Stonehill, please. Turn it down. Yes. Yes, the music. (VOLUME INCREASES) I said down! This guy's impossible. I like that song. JOHN: Hey. What's up, John? Everything all right at home? Yeah. Have you heard that Erich Loring has agreed to put together a leadership team? Yeah, I heard some rumor about it. What bullshit. Now I'm gonna have to spend a couple of hours a week jawin' with Zymagen guys? No. No. No, you won't, 'cause I'm not putting you on the team. What'd you say? I really wanted to. You're not putting me on the team? Is that what you said? What are you, some varsity track coach? They didn't buy our company 'cause they like your Ivy League charm, Jersey. It's me they wanted. You can't bench me. It's against the laws of nature. You're still gonna be able to prove that your theory is right. Yeah, but other scientists are gonna evaluate my results, right? Not me. Everyone here reveres your science. This is about interpersonal issues. Who put you up to this? The decision was mine. It's for the overall good of the program. "For the overall good of the program." Wow, John, you really got the corporate lingo down good. What's next, "Acceptable loss?" JOHN JR.: No. JOHN: Does anybody really know how to do this? Except for us. But wait, who's going? MEGAN: It's John's turn still. (KIDS EXCLAIMING) Nice one. (PHONE RINGING) Okay. I'll get it. Nice one, Megs. Hello? Marcus, hi. Oh, my God. PATRICK: Aw, man. I almost got 'em down. You guys sit tight, okay? Here, John, grab him. If there is anything we can do, anything at all, will you call? Okay. We love you guys so much. Okay, bye-bye. Aileen. That was Marcus Temple. Lauren... She... He said she went in her sleep, that it was peaceful. JOHN JR.: How old is she? How old was Lauren? Lauren was 9 years old. Come here. JOHN: That way, we can be certain that we're developing the correct one. Forget certainty, and let's try and figure out which enzyme has the better odds. If we develop only one enzyme, what would happen if we guessed the wrong one? Mr. Crowley, I've asked Kent to set up a testing protocol to help us guess right. We'll do an exhaustive range of tests. I'm calling it "The Mother of All Experiments." (ALL CHUCKLING) The 4 enzymes will be color-coded, yellow, blue, green and magenta, and known only by those color codes so no researcher will know which one he's testing. Only after we pick a winner, the secret identity will be revealed. GIRL: Come on, Megan! GIRL: But I want to! JOHN: Just roll your wrist. I can't. It's okay. It's all right. Let's try another one. Okay. Let's try again. Ready? Ready? (KIDS CHEERING) Big winner! Yay! Here you go, look at that. You got a penguin. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) JOHN: Hey, Bob. Bob. How you doin'? I brought you some ribs. Not as good as the ones from The Corner Saloon, but if you're hungry... (MUSIC STOPS) What do you want? The results. "Mother of All Experiments." Well, which enzyme did they choose? The leadership team spent the whole afternoon arguing. are ahead of the others, but it's too close to call. Tomorrow, we spend the day hashing it out to decide which one to choose. Bob. I'm asking you to read this. I value your opinion more than anyone else in the world. Well, maybe you should have valued my opinion a little sooner, instead of playing hatchet man for the bean counters. Get the hell out of my lab. It's in your interest to know about this, Bob. Get out. Wouldn't it benefit you... Get out. The green enzyme's the best. Show 'em my analysis, they'll understand. Hey, wait up, Bob. Is the green enzyme yours? I recognize patterns in the results. I'd know my baby a mile away. So the green one is yours? No. No, it's not. My theory is still the best, but it's not ready for manufacture. Theirs is crude and uninspired, but it's ready. Bob, I don't even know the words to say thank you. Don't bother. I didn't do it for you. JOHN JR.: Yes, it is! Oh, my gosh. Do you see the kite up there? Yeah. That's so cool! JOHN: Annie, careful! Building a bastion. AILEEN: Right there. Yeah. (PHONE RINGING) Okay! Dad, like... Ready? Dad, you promised no more phone calls. I know. I know I did, but... What's in there? We can take turns burying the phone when I get back. Okay! I'll start digging a hole. You hold that for a sec. John Crowley. John, it's Kent Weber. Kent, hey. Did you get my suggested protocol for the clinical trials? Yeah. You made some pretty optimistic assumptions about where our enzyme supply will be. I see. Well, what do you think that a more realistic... John, I'll give to you straight. The clinical trial will be for infants only. (EXCLAIMS) Infants need so much less enzyme, and, as you know, our initial supply will be so limited. And the drug has much higher odds of being effective with infants than with older children. We have to consult Erich on this. We have to consult Erich. I already did. He confirmed the decision. Infants only. I understand your personal reasons for... (SIGHS) These decisions have to be made objectively, rationally. I'm sorry. I... I really am. (ENGINE STARTING) (ELECTRONIC WHIRRING) GUARD: Hold it, pal. Mr. Crowley, what are you doin' in here? I was just... You're not authorized. No... I can explain everything. What's the matter, Chuck? Is there a problem? Yeah, there's a problem. I got Mr. Crowley in here without clearance. That's my fault, now. I got busy in the lab, I sent Jersey boy here to get me a couple jugs of enzyme. Sorry. Thanks, Chuck. Thanks for saving my ass. It's really big of you, especially after what went down between us. You mean your ruthless, cold-hearted betrayal? Yeah, well, when I thought about it from your point of view... Shit, if it was my kids dying, I wouldn't have hesitated to crush you like a bug. Do you remember when we first met, and you told me that I should stop chasing miracles and should go home and enjoy my kids, while they're still here? Yeah. I made the wrong choice. Jersey, you know what a sibling study is? No. It's a drug trial with just 2 patients with the same genetic inheritance. Siblings, with the same disease. Megs and Patrick. Well, would Zymagen go for something like this? There's real research value in it. And with just two patients, it wouldn't take much enzyme. But Webber would have to sign off on it. Well, let's not tell him till we've got our ducks in a row. I could draw up a protocol and see if I can find a hospital willing to administer it. Bob. Well, don't get your hopes up, kid. It's a Hail Mary. (READING) Ducks in a row. "Stonehill, careful review, protocol, Sibling Trial, 146, "are pleased to inform you Megan Crowley and Patrick "have been accepted into the trial!" I just got it. Quack, quack, quack. Have you talked to him yet? No. I did the science. You make the sale. Thank you. Good luck. Right. Does he have about 5? RECEPTIONIST: He does, yeah. Thanks. No problem, Mr. Crowley. Hey, Kent? Knock-knock. Got a minute? Kent? Do you have any idea what you've done? Excuse me? We got a call this morning from Portland Rose Hospital, about sending them enzyme for your kids? Right. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm here to talk to you about. You and Stonehill set this up behind my back. Now you come to me. It's all tentative. You want this company to sponsor a drug study, for 2 children whose father is an executive of this company? Have you never heard the term "conflict of interest?" It has nothing to do with a... Do you know what the FDA would do if they found out? There is strong scientific justification for this study. There is great research value. I'm a doctor, John. I know the research value! But you guys just can't go off half-cocked without consulting us! And I'm sure that if we just go and talk to Erich, we can... Erich already knows. He's furious about being blindsided. I didn't try to blindside anyone. This is the reason why we have a reporting structure, why we have established procedure, why there is protocol. You heartless, bloodless machine. You just have to fight me every step of the way! Don't you? You just hated it when I brought the kids with Pompe to the doorstep! You weren't thinking about those kids when you put your children into that program and jeopardized a decade's worth of research investment made by this company! This is not about a return on an investment! It's about kids, kids with names, dreams, families that love them. You've jeopardized your chances of ever getting your kids treated. (SLAMMING) (SHOUTING) I'm not arguing science with you! On every level! On every level, you've stood... (TAPPING ON DOOR) I was just drafting a letter of apology for senior management, but I guess we're past that point. I just spoke to Erich, and we are terminating your employment. Okay, I'll pack up my stuff. Just one thing, John. I may well be a tight-ass pencil-pushing company man, but I resent being called heartless. Look... Just let me finish. The reason we're terminating your employment, is to eliminate the conflict of interest. This strategy was brought to my attention by our colleague, Dr. Stonehill, in rather crude terms. This will allow the sibling trial to proceed for its purely scientific value. Ah. Have your desk cleared out by the end of the day. Kent, what's with the... Oh... I wanted to make sure you didn't punch me out before I could tell you. Well, um... ...thank you very much for firing me. My pleasure. I never liked you. Likewise. Hey, you guys, bring anything you want extra... Mom! Mom! What? Can I bring the bow and arrow? Yes, yes. Hey! (CHUCKLES) John, what... What? We have a usable enzyme that's ready for clinical trials. When? When will it be ready? Megs and Patrick start their infusions before the end of this month. Oh, my God. Yeah. Oh, my God. John. Hey, John, Daddy's here. Oh, hi, guys. JOHN JR.: Hey, Dad. Why is Mommy sad? Not sad, baby, so happy. So happy. Why is Mommy being so weird? Well, it's because we got the special medicine for you, Megs, and for you, Patrick, and you're gonna get it really soon. (GASPS) JOHN JR.: That's great! So, who wants to push the button? JOHN: Megs, Patrick, you ready? When will we know if it's working? It'll be a while, honey. It's not pink. Excuse me? Your Uncle Bobby is here. Huh? I don't know. You can go back if you like. Okay. John. Uncle Bobby. They wouldn't let me in unless I was family. Some things for the kids. Thanks. Sleeping, huh? Hey, thanks for coming. I'm a scientist. Gotta track the experiment. JOHN: I wish your enzyme was the one that passed the test. But the one the kids are getting, it's the right one, right? I mean... It's gonna help them. Yeah, you guys have done everything humanly possible. We just have to see what the tests show. JOHN: You and I have had our differences, and I just want you to know something. I want you to know that... Yeah. Don't interrupt. Okay. I want you to know that I appreciate everything that you've done for Megs and Patrick, and I'm never gonna forget it for the rest of my life. Not gonna kiss me, is he? I will restrain him. Don't tempt me. PATRICK: Daddy loves SpongeBob, Daddy loves SpongeBob. (BOTH LAUGHING) MEGAN: Stop! PATRICK: Daddy loves SpongeBob. Guys? (CHUCKLES) What's going on? What's so funny? (CHUCKLES) What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? Sugar. It's a sugar high. The enzyme's breaking down the sugar in their muscles. The medicine's working? Yeah. John. Megs! Hi. (KIDS CONTINUE LAUGHING) (CHUCKLING) (CHANGE THE WORLD PLAYING) AILEEN: John, drive safe! JOHN JR.: Enjoy the ride! Rock and roll! Bye! Have fun. Bye! So you could see the truth That this love I have inside Is everything it seems But for now I find It's only in my dreams That I can change the world I would be the sunlight in your universe You would think my love was really something good Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Change the world Baby, if I could change The world
