I have three days of meetings here before I move on to Montreal. Merci. Au revoir. Please state the purpose of your visit. Well, hello there. Is your mother or father travelling with you? Do you have anything to show me? Some papers? That's very nice. One second. Yeah, can you send someone over from Special Handling? Flight number? Are you joking? At this point, we're still searching for what carrier he came in on. Christ. Well, let's keep him here till we figure things out. It's incredible that he could've got in without somebody somewhere papering him. How could something like this happen? Don't ask me. I've got my own department to worry about. You don't know where he's from, you don't know what processes they've got. Maybe they've got shit. I hope that's not the case. Why are we being so quiet? He doesn't understand a word we're saying. Hey, you wanna come here? Right there. Good. Okay, smile, honey, I'm going to take your photo. ... Yeah. Okay, well, there are three possible flights he could've come in on. Yes. So I need you to track down those manifests and... Shit, I gotta call you back. Hey. Don't drink that, that's not good. There's a water fountain right over here. Come on, I'll show you. Hey, you wanna come to the farm with me? I was gonna pass through there on the way to my friend's. Come on. It's got all the best animals. Cows, horses and goats. Sheep. Just stay here. Hey. Hi. Don't bike in the road, Cayle. Hear me? - Y es. Stay on the sidewalks. Where'd he go? - Who? That boy. We were playing a game together. What, you have a new imaginary friend? He wasn't imaginary. You know I'm your only non-imaginary friend, don't you? Listen, I have something to show you. You won't believe it. - What? What is it? Not here. Where? Let's go to our place. Look at this. Listen. "Residents of Toronto's Cabbagetown "have reported sightings "of what they claim to be a strange, sapiens-like humanoid "scurrying around in the cavernous underworld "of the picturesque neighbourhood. "One Parliament St. resident "describes his run-in with the creature. "It occurred while he went in search of his missing kitten. "He discovered a hidden passage leading under a building, "and there saw a dead kitten and the alleged monster, "covered in slate-grey fur. "After the creature whispered in a raspy voice, "'Go away, go away,' "it scurried off down a 45-degree-angle tunnel which descended as far as the man could see." Wow. - Can you believe that? A monster, living underground. Do you think it's real? - Y eah. How do you know? - 'Cause I do. Well... my mom says that monsters aren't real. Well, they are. Your mom just says that so you won't be scared. My mom used to tell me the same thing. That's what moms do. Let's see it for real. I know where there's an entrance. Where? - In the ravine, under the subway tracks. - I don't know-- - Come on, Jacob. What's the matter? You scared? Ahhhh! - Whoa! You're such a sissy. - But you scared me! Mamma's boy. - I am not! Ah!!! Come on! You're too fast! Cayle! Where are you taking us? Who's Cayle? I am the great Queen Alabantia. My kingdom is under siege by an evil intruder from another land. Is there any brave knight out there who might be able to save me from this horrible intruder? Me. And who art thou, "Me"? Sir Jacob... of Riverdale! So you're brave, are you? The bravest. - Prove it. If you prove it, I have many riches to offer you in return. Many. C'mon! You're in there. Aren't you? What are you? What are you? Ow! Look who it is. The freak and the dyke. You two lovers now? Fuck off, Zack. Oooh, "fuck off"! That's pretty tough. You telling me to fuck off, dyke? I'm not a dyke. Dyke. Whatcha gonna do? Watch as we beat on your little-- Come on! Don't just stand there, kick her ass! Fucking pussies! Don't you ever let anyone talk to you like that! Ever! Hear me? Okay. Promise? Promise. Cayle? - What? I want to find it. What? I want to go find the monster. You do? But we can't. Zack and them are still back there. They'd kill us. Tonight, then. At midnight. Jacob, are you sure? Hello? Oh, hi, Mom. Good. Yeah. Okay. All right. Bye. Uh, I gotta go. Dinner's ready. Okay. Tonight. Come by my house at midnight. Set your alarm and sneak out. I'll bring flashlights and a knife just in case. Okay. Midnight. Promise? - Promise. I'm home! Hi, honey. - Hey, Mom. Did you have fun with Cayle today? Yep. You stayed in the park, right? - Mm-hmm. All right. Go get washed up. Dinner's on the table. Help me. Okay, let's go. That's good. Wh-what happened? What? - Your arm. What happened to your arm? I... I fell. What did you fall on? Nothing. Nothing... Does it hurt? Yeah. Do you wish your mom was still around? Yeah. I hate him. You ready? Yeah. Shhh! Did you hear that? - No. Wh-what'd you hear? I... I dunno, like a moan or something. Let's keep going. Go away! Come on! Did you see it?! Did you see it?! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, I saw it! His shoes. Look at his shoes. His shoelaces are tied. The guy just jumped! Let's go. I'm sorry it's so cold in here. My furnace blew up yesterday. Wow. That's cool. I never usually talk to strangers. No, me neither. But... I'm glad you did. What do you do? Oh, I'm a designer. I build things. What sort of things? Well... furniture, um, various objects, shoes... Cool! Yeah, my Kicks. Do you have any questions for me? No. Well... do you, uh... the, uh, the beads? What do you think of the beads? I never actually thought about them. My ex-boyfriend put them up. What do you think? From a design perspective... they're not very practical. Say you want to serve food... Right. Oh. If you want, I can lend you my Bead Be Gone spray. Tsshhh... Tsh-tsh-tsh-tsh. Thank you, that would come in very handy. What's wrong? Well, this big Somalian guy kneed me in the gut when I was playing basketball. Oh. Well... I borrowed this book from the library. What? That is a Photoshop federal offence. Some of the most interesting books have the ugliest covers. This one's about a boy who was born with the gift of touch healing. He lays his hands on a person's injury and heals them. You believe all that? - Yeah. You want me to try healing you? Sure. Uh, I don't know what you did, but... actually, I think it feels better. Good. Boris, do you think it's strange we're lying on the bed beside each other? - No. Have you ever been in love? Mm-hmm. Never? No. Are you gay? - No. No, I just, uh... I always imagined that one day... I would see a woman... and fall instantly in love with her. It just hasn't happened yet. Ah, it's late. I gotta bounce. I like your beard. It suits you. Thanks. - It's kinda like Ernest Hemingway. Yeah, I thought I'd grow it out. - You mean for warmth? Well, yeah... Y eah, I mean, kinda. I thought it'd be cool. It's kind of a female repellent. You know, when you got, like, a ton of guys hanging off you, and you're just like, "Whoa, chill, chill out. No, I-I... don't know what that's like. It doesn't really work... ... is the thing, 'cause some girls really like it. I guess you... I guess you go out... on a lot of dates? Tch... Y es. Like romantic dates? No. No, no, no. Well, I mean, aren't all dates romantic? Not necessarily. Is this a date we're on? I think so. "Dative... dating agency... date rape... "date: A particular day of the month or year, "the time at which a particular event has occurred or will occur." There's a "To date." "An appointment, especially a romantic or social engagement." So there you go. Romantic. Social. I mean... ... we're both right. Imagine if you knew every word in the dictionary. I'd have a hardcover. Oh, well, that was a gift. If it was up to me, I'd have a hardcover, too. Boris, I have to tell you something. I think... I think I have a crush on you. Yeah, I thought you might. Is it okay if I kiss you? Yeah. Ahem. Willia... ... I never would've approached you. Are you a shy guy? Yeah. "Love shy" refers to a debilitating shyness that impedes the ability to form Iong-lasting romantic relationships. Love-shy sufferers experience an overwhelming fear of intimacy. Love-shy men are prone to anti-social personality disorders. How to get a guy to like you. Make conversation. People with Asperger Syndrome are neurologically unable to understand other's emotions. ... and respect you as you are. Rekindle the energy that dilutes your... ...attracting confusion in your relating. Crown myself the prince of buzz Can't wait until you can't wait Till you unsubscribe I'll be a lonely scribe Whoa. Imagine trying to fight a war in that. Y eah, not very practical. That look is deadly, though. Happy belated birthday. - Whoa, this is all for me? Yup. Yeah, this is one of my favourite books. Oh, and this - that is the night that I first saw you. I knew I liked you right away. Did you mean to draw it in this shape? Like, with everything? No. Um... I-I actually just started drawing and it... turned out that way. It's, uh... it's so... awesome. It's... it's really a nice card. Thanks. You're welcome. So what do you think of what happened between us the last time? I was surprised. A good surprise, or a bad surprise? Well I... I had a good time. Phew. I thought I had come on too strong. No, it's okay. I wouldn't know, really. I'm not... that experienced, actually, so... How many times have you had sex? Four... four times. But one was like a... two-night stand? What if we made a trade? I mean, I've never built anything ever. You could teach me how. I mean, we could design it together. And if you teach me how to build something, I could teach you about sex. Sounds like a good deal to me. Whoo!!! Marine-grade, uh, teeth.. might be nice. That's what... Seriously! Are we gonna do this, or what? Slit! Thank you. Oh... Ow! - Ow! You're gonna have to take that off. But it's my protection. Not anymore. Okay, T each. Wow. You shave. Well, you know... it's like, uh, not as messy... and I like the way it looks. It's, like, less... animalistic. It looks good, right? Y eah. Good. Alright, dear, brace yourself. At the count of three, breathe in. One... two... three! How's it going? Good. So... I got... a... What? I got a-- - A what? I got a tat... - You got a tattoo? No, not a tattoo. - All right. But I got a-- You're killing me over here! What is it? I GOT A BRAZILIAN!!! So you wanna come in? Actually, I promised my dad I'd watch the World Cup with him. I see. Well, call me sometime, will ya? Yeah, yeah... fo' sho. Uh, have fun with that Brazilian. When am I gonna see you again? I... I dunno. Whatever. I'm kinda like Polkaroo. Who's Polkaroo? Well, Polkaroo's like a creature... who kinda comes and goes. Like me. Polkaroo is the imaginary creature from the children's TV show Polkadot Door, broadcast by TV Ontario. Polkaroo never spoke, other than to exclaim its own name. Only one of the two hosts could see Polkaroo at a time, Ieaving the other to cry. "Polkaroo was here and I missed him again?" Howdy do Polkaroo How are you Polkaroo What do you say Polkaroo Polkaroo Hey... What are you doing here? Excuse me. There's a boy. I think he's lost. Boris, I need to talk to you. I had to see you... Because I need to know... Actually, I have to know. Are you interested... in a romantic relationship with me? Well... ... it's a really... it's a really hard decision... to make... .... but no... ... I'm not. Y'know, it's not you. It's me. I-I have to... stay open to some things. It's okay. Now I know. Y'know? It was the not knowing that was driving me crazy. I couldn't stop thinking of you! I had no idea you felt that way. I mean, I... I never think of you. I mean, I never... really think about you when you're not... around. It's fine. I'm glad we cleared that up. I feel a lot better. Does this mean we can't have sex? Are you sure about this? Yes. God, you are so beautiful. And the crazy thing is, you don't even know how amazing you are. Omigod... Okay, hold on. Wait. No... Oh, God... Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh. Oh, crud. Oh, crud. Oh. Are you okay? Yeah... Uh... I never... I never should've come over here. I... I should've trusted my instincts. Where are you going? I can't... I'm going... home! Okay, slow down. I have to go! - I'm not a monster trying to keep you captive here. - All right, what? So talk to me. - I'm talking to you! When are we gonna see each other? I don't know, okay? I can't say! - Why? Because, Willia, you don't... It's too defining! Stop! Don't go. Run to the thing you fear the most! Uh, you're pointing at me. Oh. Sorry. Oh... Willia. This is really... hard to explain. I'm doing my best. I have to... go. Boris, come on. Remember when we first met? You told me that you believe that you'll fall in love at first sight. It doesn't work that way. Real love takes time. You're probably right. I never... got to choose. I was never chosen. Goodbye, Boris. Bye.

Excuse me, officers - please, I need your help. I need your help right now. Can you put your coffees down? Please, I need your help. I need you to come with me, I've got an address. Whoa, wait a minute. What's going on? I have an address and I need you to take me there! Okay? - You, you're not allowed in here. No, there's no time. - Let's go! Come on! There is no time! There's no time! No time! - I don't let people like you in my store! - You shouldn't have done that! You shouldn't have done that! - Get in there! I came here to help! You should listen to me! I came here... to help!!! Ahhh! Officers. Sonofabitch. I thought I told you to stay the fuck out of my store-- - Hey, hey! Relax! Do not make you take me in, all right? I know exactly where he is. What are you talking about? The little kid. I took him. So, Henry... what we got here are some vagrancy charges. Nothing like forcible confinement or abduction... Doesn't seem like you're the kind of guy that'd hurt a kid. That's it? You got nothing to say? All right, Henry-- Ugh! Shit, come on! Ah...! Little man! Hey. Little man, there you are. Aw... I've been worried about you. Henry! Step away from the boy! He's right here. - Step away from the boy! Step away from the boy!!! Ahhh... - Just get him out of here. He can't understand you! You're gonna be fine, little man. Oh, not in the puddle!!! Not in the puddle! You're gonna be fine, little man! You're gonna be just fine! You'll be fine! He says he's not hurt. All right, ask him about the homeless guy. Ask him if that guy ever... touched him. He says no. He brought him here, right? Even he admits that. He says no. That's not possible. He must've misunderstood. Ask him again. No, the other man brought him here. The door was locked and he was really scared. He then got frightened by the sirens and ran away. The other man didn't do anything to him. He would like to play chess with him. Go upstairs. See if that guy can give us anything on where to find this... other guy. And if he doesn't? Then we let him go. Now that you got him back, now that he's safe, I need you to promise me something. Yeah? I need you to promise me one thing. Sure. - Okay? Don't let him go swimming. You live in your own world, don't you, Henry? Don't worry about it. I promise not to let him go... swimming. Hey, Henry. Wait a minute. Hey, uh... why don't you let us get you into a shelter? At least get you a meal. Whaddya say? No... Well, let us give you a ride. At least run you back to where we found you. No, thank you. No. Thank you. Waiting for the world to come home Everybody's gone I'm here all alone Waiting for the world To come home Waiting for the world To come knockin' on my door Just like it did before I'm waiting for the world To be born
