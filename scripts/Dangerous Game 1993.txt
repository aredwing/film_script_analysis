Watch. - Taste it. I'll bet you this tastes so good that I'm not going to believe it. - Want a steak? - No. That's why Tommy didn't want pasta, I guess. - It's delicious. - Yeah, right. Thank you. The perfect gentleman. I said it's delicious. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Don't forget me, kid. I'm your daddy. Romulo, listen, we're celebrating the beginning of our new movie. Yes. - Would you sing a song for us? - I'd be glad to. You would? Thank you. Beautiful. The story I'm telling, The Mother of Mirrors... concerns a husband and wife who have agreed upon... a certain lifestyle to help them to live. In that relationship, the wife has a change of heart... about the lifestyle that they're living, which has included... multiple sex partners and drugs. Sort of a very materialistic living. And she has had a change of mind. And has come to understand for herself that, that lifestyle is a lie. Whereas her husband, he feels... that the way of life they agreed upon... involving multiple sex, drugs and everything, is for him a truth. However horrendous it might be, or however hellish that truth might be... he needs that. That, he feels, is giving him something, is taking him someplace... that is as truthful... as her religious discoveries. Not only that... but he feels that those religious discoveries are shams. Frank? I think he was on the set talking with Sarah. He left after that. Check his camper. Eddie, we got him. You got him. It's okay, we got him. He's on the set. You don't know where he is. Quiet back there, please. $1,500 fucking sofa. All this shit! Gonna burn it down to the fucking ground. Torch this fucking house tonight and not even blink. Burn you and me in it. Yeah, Frank. I want you to take your time to build it. I want you to take the time to build it. He's looking for satisfaction and can't get it. He ain't getting it from the booze. He goes over to her, he ain't getting it from her. He comes back in here, he's still... getting drunker, can't get satisfaction. I want you to go pee on the fucking floor. "I'll get a reaction. I'll show her. "I'll show her. Fuck her, and fuck this house and everything." What's that saying, "The eyes are the windows to the soul"? Come over here. I wanna see what happens when you step in front of the mirror. Maybe it'll be good for you. Maybe it'll be good for me. Maybe I'll have a conversion experience. Maybe I'll become like you. Fucking perfect. Come here. Just want to see what happens. I want you to look in the mirror. I want you to tell me what you see. What do you see? You know what I see? I see a two-bit cunt having a nervous breakdown. I see a woman who's holier than all... whose hands are filled with the blood... of who the hell knows how many abortions, how many one-night fucks. The lies, the deceits. You leave a trail of misery like that, and then you dare to condescend to me? I'm not condescending to you. The fuck you're not! You know, I'm sick of this metanoia shit. Your ethics, your rosaries, your novenas. All right. Okay, Russell. No, it's not all right. You think you're something special, right? But you know what you are? You're a half-baked nobody with a broken heart. Well, fuck you and your opinions. I'm not stupid, Russell. - Stupid? - You don't have to talk to me that way. You're too boring to be stupid. You're dead. Your insecurities paralyzed you. You're fucking dead and you don't even know it. I know it. I hope that I can be strong enough to live out what I just said I want to live out. I mean, isn't that exactly what's happening with Claire? - She has this revelation... - She tried to be as strong. She's saying, "This is what I've come to, and this is what I believe in." And every time he hits her or pushes her or threatens her, she's like... She's challenged, she's like: "Can I live up to this? Can I hold onto this? "Can I live what I just said I believed in? Can I?" And every minute with Russell is a test. It begins with him arguing with you, that "my journey is as spiritual as yours is. "I need this on my journey. "I need this to face hell, I need the coke... - "I need the sex, I need the booze." - Right. "That's as real as your journey, as your spiritual quest is. "You need what? A book, you need a cross, a symbol. "I need this." So it becomes an argument. Between heaven and hell, if you will... you know, to find what the right path is. What do you call a girl without an asshole? - What? - Single. Oh, God. I know one. - Why did God create men? - Why? Because vibrators can't mow the lawn. Come on, that was funny, wasn't it? She's on a roll. She is indeed. I won't even ask where you've heard these. Okay. What is a brunette standing between two blondes? - I give up. - An interpreter. Okay, why does a blonde always wear huge hoop earrings? So she has somewhere to put her feet. No, so she has some place to rest her ankles. Here's a good one. How do you know when a teamster's dead? When a teamster dies? Wait. I should know this. The doughnut rolls out of his hands. - I'm gonna go. - Okay. - Thanks for dinner, whoever is paying for it. - Me, I'm paying. - Bye, Jane. - Bye, sweetie. - Goodbye, Randy. - It's a pleasure. - Thanks for coming. - Bye, Eddie. - Be careful. - Of what? Lawn mowers? Wasn't I right to insist that you use her, or not? - She's great, she's fantastic. - She's quite a gal. Now, I know he's your friend and everything, Eddie... but are you really sold on Burns? Who would you rather see in the role? I was just floating it out there. - Some CAA client? - Of course, I'm an agent, you know. But if that's your choice, I back it. You tried to get rid of him. What do you mean you back it? - I was just floating it out there... - Anybody else besides a CAA client? I'm sure I could come up with a list of non-CAA clients, if you wanted to see one. You heard the joke about the actor that walked into his agent's office... he opened the door, walked in, the agent stood up and, "Hello," he lied. Yeah, I've actually heard that. Nothing personal. Nothing personal taken, believe me. - Yeah. - Frank, it's me. Hey, what's happening, man? What are you doing? I'm in bed. I'm looking at the stuff. How's it look? I think you'd be surprised. She looks good, Frank. She looks good? How good does she look? You ought to look at the tapes. I don't have to look at it, man. I was there, remember? Look, we both know she's a fucking whore and she can't act. Give her a chance, will you? I'm giving her a chance. Okay, man, huh? I know that makes me feel ugly, unsympathetic. I need these things. I don't want to feel bad. I want to feel good, but you're not helping me. You can't ask me to go back to doing those things you want me to do. I won't. I can't. He says you look good in the tapes. You're an asshole. - I'm a what? - You're an asshole. - What did you... - lf I'm a whore, what does that make you? Let's get something straight, Burns. You didn't fuck me, you fucked the girl in the script. I fucked who? Wait a minute. I fucked who? I fucked the girl in the script? That's right. Come on, don't give me that... What are you pulling, that method actor shit? I'm not pulling shit. I'm expecting company, okay. - Come on, I gotta go. - You're expecting... - Where you going? - I'm going. Where are you going? It's early. It's 1:15. The night's young. - It's late. - It's not late, it's early. Stick around. We haven't even gone over the script yet. Sorry, I got what I needed. - What do you mean, you got what you want? - Don't say anything to Eddie about this. What do you mean, "Don't say anything to Eddie"? If I have to explain it to you, what's the point? Just don't say anything to Eddie. Are you worried about your close-ups? Look, he doesn't need to know, all right? He doesn't need to know what? - Bye. - Where are you going? Hang out a while. So, that bitch leave yet? She's gone. Did you bring it? You fucking asshole. Been keeping me here waiting for an hour. Come on, now, where is it? - I got it. - Give me it. So, how was she? What, are you jealous? Don't say that. - What's the matter? - What, she give you head? - Did she give me head? - Yeah, how'd she do it? - Maybe she did. - What'd she do? What's it to you? Did she go like this? Did she go? - Give me that. - Did she go like that? Asshole. Give me that. Give me the shit and cut the bullshit. - Give me it. - Okay. I got it. - Give me it. - Yeah, right. But don't you ever fucking do that to me again. Do you hear me? - Ken, if she's over there, is that okay? - That's fine. Drastic. I need a little more. Little more smoke. You ready over there? Quietly, folks. So can Hiram do whatever he has to do to me... and then I can get ready, so no one has to touch me until you're ready to shoot? - Is that all right? - Yeah. Sarah, can you lift your head up, please? How does that look outside, in the video? Yes, that's good. - Is that good? - Yes. - Do we have it? - Yes. Eddie, what do you think? Does it look good to you? Oh, my God. What should I do? Cut it. - No, we haven't cut it yet. - All right, go down and get lower. Cut it. That's the way we fucking set it! You just do whatever you want to do. Okay. I want the camera to get her if she sticks her head in the sink. - Are we ready to go? - We're ready. Roll sound. What do you want me to do now? I don't know. I want you to do what you did. Okay? - Eddie, camera's rolling. - Okay, roll it. Okay, we're rolling. - Give me a slate. - Take five. You want my head up higher? That's fine. Whenever you want to go. I'm not fucking getting my picture taken by Richard Avedon right now. You do whatever you want to do. The camera's going to follow you. It'll follow you. - Should I just go when I'm ready? - Yes, just go when you're ready. Try and get down. Oh, God. What should I do? Is that where he's hiding, in the medicine chest? You think he hears you, Claire? There's nothing in there but tampons and aspirins. That's the closest thing you're going to get to comfort in this life, baby. You want to know why I'm like this? Because I've seen you suck the cock... of your girlfriend's husband and not even bat an eye. I've seen you snort drugs with corporate CEOs... and act like you were sitting in a Sunday school. I've seen you rob money out of your mother's pocketbook. I've seen you hock your dead grandmother's wedding ring, just for a laugh. And I knew... that if you could do that... you could do anything. Russell, if it helps... I'll be the one to take the blame. I'll leave... and you can join me anytime you want. She just said, "I'm leaving you. "I'll take the blame. I'm the one that's going to leave. "I'm leaving you." Then he says, "I knew it would come to this." And I gotta feel that moment: He has just been left. If he gives me that feeling of, "I've just been left"... he will get to the next moment, which is... First he has to feel that he's just been left. "I knew it would come to this." And then he goes back at her again. "You can't resist, can you? "You gotta bring peace to all the huddled masses. "You should have been Mother Cabrini!" But he's just been left, his fucking heart is breaking here. "You should be Mother Cabrini. "I'll be the one to take the blame. Oh, that's wonderful! "You should be Mother Cabrini... "instead of a pill-popping, middle-class neurotic. But it's too late. "It ain't gonna happen, and don't think I don't know... "deep down inside what you're itching to do. "You're dying to confess every fucking thing you ever did and ask for pardon." "That's what's it about. "Serve your sentence and be cleansed, but there's one problem: "Everything you ever done was with me... "and I ain't ready to bare my soul to nobody." And that's to her, "especially to a God that don't exist." It's a battle between him and God. Who's she going to serve, God or him? - "You gonna serve God or me?" - Right. "You have any idea what you're trying to do? "You want to be cleansed, you want to give yourself over to him. "To someone, a God that doesn't fucking exist! "You ain't dealing with your life, you want God to deal with your life. "You have a responsibility to me." It's easy for you... This is what the focus position is, okay? You can't resist, can you? You want to bring peace to the lives of the huddled masses. I mean, Jesus Christ, you should've been Mother Cabrini... instead of a pill-popping, dick-sucking, middle-class neurotic. I know what you're doing here. You want to ask forgiveness for every fucking bad thing you've done in your life. But it ain't going to happen, baby. Because you know why? Everything you've done, I was there watching... and I'm not about to bare my soul to nobody... especially a fucking God that doesn't exist. You better hurry up, Claire. Jesus Christ, I can hear you praying even in the dark. You fucking better hurry up. Want to have a drink later? - How about five drinks later? - Okay. Where do you want to go? Someplace nobody would recognize you. What, like McDonald's? Okay, McDonald's. Wait a second, they don't serve alcohol there. - We'll find our own place. - We'll bring our own. - So? - So, you got more flowers. - I'll call you later. - All right. I watched all his movies. How come it's only people in Hollywood that wear sunglasses all the time? Because we know how ugly everyone is, and so we wear them. When you wear sunglasses, everyone looks better. - He's not ugly. - That was my answer. I wear them 'cause I used to do a lot of drugs and my eyes are small. They haven't opened up yet, so I have to cover my eyes. It's their attitude that's ugly. - How is your work going? - Work's going good. Excuse me. If we don't talk about you, it's like there's no conversation? Is that how it works? You could include us in the conversation. - I just asked him how his work is going. - How is your work going? Good. We put a new porch in the house last week. The cleaters and gutters, we got a deal on. No, I'm trying to raise money, that's why I'm happy for you. - How much do you need? - What time can he get here? I need, like, you know, around $12 million. I got $6 million. I need $18 million. - For what? - Can you cut me a check? For a movie. That I'll pitch you on when you finish this, if you're still alive. - A script you wrote? - I wrote it with somebody, Tom Leopold. - How's your father? - Fine. He's desperate to meet you. My father's dead, if anybody's interested. I mean, how's her father. Her father is a very big fan of mine, and he's 86 years old. - Really? - He really is. - And get this one. - What? He used to be married to my mother's mother. Mother, you had me But I never had you He used to be married to what? - To my mother's mother. - So what does that make you? A double bastard, or something? You're a double bastard. Is that how it works? They got married. What do you do on Mother's Day? Grandmother's dead. What does your father do on Mother's Day? Your grandmother died, then he married your mother? They got the marriage annulled. They met at the funeral. But, you know, ladies and gentlemen... Once upon a time, we're making love, and... Wait, where were you? In our bed. - At your house? - Yeah. And, we were making love... and my nose started to bleed. - Why? - It just started to bleed. - Too much pressure? - I was making love... and I saw the red drops come on her face. And she went like this, it was blood... and so I gave her my come and my blood. To symbolize it, I bought her a ruby and a diamond. That's beautiful. - You made me tell you. - It's a good story. I didn't want to do it. I didn't know you were romantic. He's wearing his ass out. Little blow? No, thanks. How about you, Jennings? No. I'll have another tequila. I'll have another one, too. All this leather makes me sweat. They're a cute couple, aren't they? Who? Cookie and Lulu. - Okay, we're going to go, Francis. - Thanks for the drinks. - You going? - Nice to meet you all. - Where you going? You just got here. - When I get back, I'll tell you. - Take care. Bye. See you later. - See you later. Bye, Burns. What the fuck was all that about? What did you say to her? I told you, I worked with her. She hates you. Fucking hit and run, huh? Have a drink and go. What are they, French or something? This could be a good time to take off our sunglasses. I can't see. It was too soon. Sarah? Before... I drive you home... - I need a dance. - What? I need a dance. Here? Somewhere in a fairy tale I used to take her home in my car We learned about love in the back of a Dodge The lesson that never gone too far You see, she was going to be an actress And I was going to learn to fly She was reaching for the footlights And I was reaching for the sky That's a cut. Leslie! Guys, we got to go again, right away. Reset. Quickly! Touch-ups. Guys, right away, please? Keep it together, please? We're going again. Right away, guys. We got to make it in five minutes. Let's go. Take this. Burns, we're ready. Come on. Let's go, guys. Lenny, gotta go. - Okay, we're going, right now. - Okay. Let's go. Smoke's fine. Give me a minute. Abandonment... comes to mind for me here. That works for me. If it works for you, you find your own term... if abandonment doesn't. This scene is about abandonment. He's being abandoned. He is not getting any reaction from her. He wants a reaction. It's like someone telling you... All of a sudden you're lying next to this woman... whom you've been married to for... excuse me, "X" number of years... everything's wonderful... and one night she rolls over, looks at you and says: "My feelings towards you have changed." A child will scream, kick... kill to have their mother's tit to hang onto, not to be abandoned. 'Cause what is abandonment? Abandonment is a death, for all of us. You go through all the thoughts you said before... 'cause they're just perfect. I've nothing to add to it. I just don't like the word "at least." The ultimate is to feel the pain and the suffering. Then we have a chance to survive. Because some rat-fucking-bastard was leading a little girl... a 7-year-old girl with a Star of David on her chest to a concentration camp. That rat-fucking cocksucker wasn't feeling anything. If he was, he couldn't take her to the gas chamber. Where is she? She's not coming down to help you. Pick it up. You want to be a martyr? Now you're a martyr! Now you're a martyr! Here. Pick it up. - You feel better? - Yeah, I do. I do feel better. You feel better? I'll make you feel better. - How do you feel? You feel better? - Stop it, you coward! I want you to hit the points about the American way of life. Okay? I want him out there now. He's speaking to us about the dream we have been sold. American consumerism, you know. This and that. That's supposed to be a life. Have a dog. Have a cat. Have a house. Have a car. Have a suit. Have a fucking tie. That's the lie that's been sold to us. Okay? We're ready to go. - Oh, no. - We're not? We're going to start when Frank enters. Okay? I want you to take your time and make the points. He bought the dream, and the dream cannot sustain him. The dream has to do with industrialization. It's a mechanical thing, it doesn't work. You got it? Okay. We live out here in this fucking suburban nightmare... with the drugs, the infidelities... the alcohol, consumerism. We do everything we could possibly do to stop from taking a fucking gas pipe. And you sit there with this pious bullshit. You want to convert? Go ahead. But don't push this hocus-pocus shit on me! If I want to stay out all night, I will! If I want to get drunk and do coke, I will. If I want to go out, find some cunt on the street and fuck her up her ass, I will! You know why? 'Cause I need to do these things. 'Cause you fucking bore me! Your tits bore me. Your face bores me. Your mouth bores me. You think I want to be like this? I don't want to be like this. I just want you to be... I just want things to be the way they were. Don't you understand that? Okay, cut. - That was what I want. - I don't know, I got lost toward the end. Sometimes we get lost. Why can't she be lost? This time you looked at him more. You tried to compose yourself more... and you were still full. You tried to look at him and show him who you are. - All right, stop talking. - That's what I wanted. Quiet, please. - Okay? - Yeah. The more you do that, the more he sees, the more you're the Mother of Mirrors... the more he reflects what he is not. That he is not the stronger. When you're ready, Frank. Look, I just want things... to be the way they were. I want you to be the way you were. That's all I'm asking you. That's all I want. I want the woman I married. I want us to be the way we were. That's all I want. The woman you married is right in front of you. Just do this for me, baby. Please. - You were so happy. - No, I wasn't happy. Stay where you are. That was a beautiful thing. Put that back in there. Put that back in there. That was beautiful. Give us some more of that. Forget about this. That was beautiful. - Do it again. Smell her. - Can I stand up? That was beautiful. More of that. Have you ever asked or begged somebody for something that you needed? You look at her. Smell her. Touch her. Smell her, Frank. Smell her. Quiet. This is Scene 43, apple. Take two is up. We've moved on to camera A-33 and B-14. 43, apple. Take two. I want you to understand something about the idea that I'm after, okay? He just wants to be able to do his cocaine... his booze, his sexual life, okay? If she went along with that, things would be fine for him. This man is not a wife-beater. He's being driven into a desperate state. She's taken a lot of abuse from this guy. And he knows he's being abusive. He can't stop. What he's doing is evil. She hasn't got the strength to give it up. But now I want you to relax with the booze. I want you to let yourself go. I want you to talk to her. Talk to her as if you're talking to... As if it's a child talking to his mother. You know? As if it's a child. "Mommy, come here. Hold me." I just want the woman I married, that's all I'm asking. The woman you married is standing right in front of you. This is the woman that's right in front of me. This. Take a good look. This is the woman I married. Take a good look. That's the woman I married. Look at that. Look at that there. I bet he jerks off to it every night before he goes to bed and fucks his wife. Look at that. What a legacy to leave behind. You don't just do something like that and forget about it overnight. Look at it! That's the woman I married. Look at her. You take a good look at it. Look at it, Claire. I'm sorry. Cut. What the fuck is wrong with you? - What's wrong with you? - We're doing a scene here. Your husband is crucifying you. Hey. - What are you talking about? - You were not there! - It was wonderful. - It sucked. - Frank, you can't cut a scene. - She sucked in the scene, man. What are you doing? She's full of shit in this scene! Don't say that about her, Frank. You're not on TV now, bitch. Frank, she's wonderful in this scene. You don't cut a scene. I cut a scene. - She's wonderful in this scene? - Yes! You don't cut a scene. I don't give a fuck what's going on. - Come on, Eddie. - You don't cut a scene! Get off the set. Get off the set? Fuck you, man. Fuck you both. You were wonderful in the scene. Okay? It's wonderful. Calm down! Come on, Frank. - Calm down, man. - Fucking cunt motherfucker. Frank, what's up? Leave him alone. Frank, it's a long shoot. Fuck her and this goddamn fucking movie. Okay, but you got to calm down. It's like I was telling you before. They're all fucking assholes. Fuck this fucking... - What? - He went off again, man. What are you doing in there? - How you doing, Eddie? - I'm good. I want to talk to Frank alone for a moment. But they can stay. Whatever you have to say... I want to talk to you alone for a minute. Let them stay, man. What are you chasing my friends out for? Come on, let's go. You don't have to go, man. Stay. Excuse me. Do me a favor? Get her out of here. - Come along. - Young lady. What the fuck is your problem? Get up and get out. I'll take care of her. What's your problem, man? I'm beginning to forget that we're friends, Frank. You hear me? What are you trying to do, fuck up my movie? I'm not trying to fuck... You're trying to fuck me up, man! Frank, listen to me. You don't cut any scenes of mine... and you don't go around whacking people... and you don't go telling my lead actress that she's a piece of shit. You don't go treating me like a piece of shit in front of everybody. How am I treating you like a piece of shit? Frank, listen to me for a second. I asked you at the beginning of this film, that I need you to go down the line for me. - And I'm not going down the line? - I need... I'm not going down the line? That's what you're telling me? You're giving me a lot, but I'm asking you something. Now listen to me. You've given me a lot, but I need something else, Frank. I need the desperation from you, Frank. You're building some kind of wall between you and the desperation. I'm telling you the truth now. You're putting something in the way. You're doing too much fucking drugs and booze or not enough. What do you expect me to do? Do what you have to do, but give me what I need. - I'm trying, man. I'm trying to give you it. - You're putting something in the way. What the fuck are you trying to do to me? Listen, Frank. The suits didn't want you on this movie to begin with. - Fuck those fucking cocksuckers. - I stuck up for you. Now don't you abandon me. I need you to dig down into fucking hell. Either do more coke or more booze, or do less... but you gotta give me what I need. No more left. Take your time with that line. He can't stand up. Give me a second. Relax. Slower. Joke. What's this shit, anyway? We live out here in the middle of this suburban nightmare... with the drugs, the alcohol, the consumerism, personal debt. We do everything... that we can do to distract us from taking the gas pipe! Then she turns her back on the very thing that got her here. All right, she wants to conform, she wants to convert? All right. Let her convert. But she doesn't have to lay this hocus-pocus shit on me! Because I don't need it! If I want to get drunk, I'll get drunk. If I want to do coke, I'll do coke. To God. If I want to go out all night, find some whore on the street... and fuck her up the ass, I will. - To God. - Because I need these things. I just lost a $200,000-a-year job. Who the fuck is going to pay the bills around here? God? Is she going to pay the bills? I need these things. On your knees. To God. Tell him what you need. I need these things. Get back on your knees, Frank, and tell God what you need. Go ahead. You can do it. I need these things. She's not there. That's right, she's not there. I have to go. See you tomorrow. - Change your... - Daddy! Hey, Tommy! - Hi! - Honey, hi! - It's so good to see you. - How are you doing? Wow, what a surprise. What are you doing here? Let me hang up the phone. Bring these in, come on. Bring it right in the bedroom there. Put them down in the bedroom, put them on the bed. You remember this room, right? Where's your... What did you do with your knapsack? Did they take it? Here it is. Why don't you take it to the bedroom, or actually, they can do it for you. - How are you? - Fine. Give me a kiss. Good to see you. What a nice surprise. I missed you so much! Me, too. I'm so glad you came. Yeah, we decided why wait for the weekend? Sit down. Take off your coat. You warm? Hey, tough guy! What's the story of your life? Nothing. Just hang those in the closet, if you don't mind. - You been a good boy? - Yeah. Why? Wow, what a surprise! What a great surprise. Wonderful. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. "Hermes guided the souls of the dead down to the brink of the river Styx." That's Hermes, guiding one of the dead down to the river Styx. "A murky, stagnant river that flowed around the underworld. "There, Hermes left them in charge of the ferryman, Charon. "If they had money to pay for their fare, Charon sent them across. "If not, he refused to take them, for he was greedy. "Those who could not pay had to wander about... "till they found the paupers' entrance to Hades. "That is why, when a man died... "his kin put a coin under his tongue." No, it's gonna be terrific. Sarah is a surprise. Sarah's got something... I think, kind of special, you know. - Yeah? - I think she's going to be all right. What's she like? Very L.A. - Is she beautiful? - She's beautiful. Or is it only makeup and bleach? - It's all a lot of money, sweetheart. - I bet. No, but she has something, I think that's... I'm going to make it work for the part. I want the first moment to be, you need to be taken care of. Your hand is in pain. She's coming over to take care of you. Then I want to see... you trying to get instant gratification from her sexually. Okay? She won't give it to you. When she doesn't, that's when you... - It's primate time. - We're ready, Eddie. I mean instant gratification. I mean, there's no kissing. No tit. No pussy. Put her hand on your cock. Then if she doesn't give you what you need, you take it. It's gonna be, the more she resists, the more it's gonna go. Don't forget the first beat. The first beat is important. - The hankie. - The hankie. Right. Why is it there? Kiss it. Kiss it and make it better. - Russell... - Kiss it. Kiss it again. Make it better. Don't. What do you mean, don't? Let me put this on your... Stop, Russell. Stop? What are you talking about? Stop. Take these off. No. No! Don't! Don't do it this way. The baby, Frank. Do it. I thought you wanted this. Don't you wanted to have a baby? I thought you wanted a baby! Get your head up, Claire. Pick up your head, Claire. Try and get your head up. Claire, try and get your head up. Okay. Cut. Wardrobe, get me a robe. Clear please. Okay. It was beautiful. You fucking piece of shit! What are you doing? - What are you smiling about? - Okay. The scene is over. - No, it's not! - What's the matter? - You know what the matter is! - What? - Fuck you, Burns! - Come on. He can't fucking act, man. He has to do everything for real. What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. - What are you trying to tell me? Tell him or cry to him. Go ahead. What is it? Fuck, he has to drink to play a drunk, he has to fucking... He doesn't have to... Okay. Let's go. Let's go out. Come here. Fuck this shit. Then he kicked the door open... and he said, "Take your clothes off... "and lie down." And he... tried to... rape me, but I... I guess my body was so rigid, that he couldn't. And then he started calling me... a disgusting lesbian... a stupid dyke... a pathetic piece of shit. That if he couldn't get it into my pussy, he was gonna make me suck it. And I remember... I don't know what I remember, I just remember... this horrible choking feeling. All of a sudden he got up, then he dragged me over to the side of the roof by my hair... and he held the knife against my throat... and he said, "I don't know if I should slit your throat... "or push you off the building." And I would have done anything for him. You poor thing. Then all of a sudden he just broke down and started crying. He ran away... and I put my clothes back on... and I walked home. What do we do? The object is to collect as many pairs as you can. Dealer shuffles cards. We did that. Remaining cards. These are the pile of cards. Eddie, swordfish, turkey burger? Turkey burger. - Turkey burger? - Veggie burger. - Turkey burger okay? - All right. Wait a second. Look at his hand, and see if... Look at your hand, see if any of the cards are the same. Let me see if he needs any help. Actually, I take the... Do you want me to start with the corn or something? Anyone, corn? - Absolutely, corn. - Yeah. This is organic corn. Guys, you want to shuck the corn for us? You guys wanna do it? - Can't I be first? - Well, I'm the dealer, but... Sammy, how about you and Tommy go to work here? - Get rid of this game. - I have an idea. Eddie, you need a cold drink? I'm gonna get the trash and start. You kids want a hot dog? You guys want a hot dog? Could you just get me a hot dog? - Do you want one right now? - Yeah. Save-On, that's a great store. You're gonna love all those toys. He's been so wonderful in getting us here. How about some hors d'oeuvres? No, thanks. You hungry? I'll take a turkey burger. A turkey burger? So California. That's me, Mr. California. Yeah, I noticed. Want to go take a nap or something? - No, I'm good. - Yeah. You're happy here? - You need a drink or something? - No. Sure? - Yeah, I'm just nursing this. - All right. I'm going to go see Tommy. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I don't know. Since I got here, you seem a little distracted. No. - Everything's going okay? - Yeah. Nobody's giving you any trouble? Only you. Excuse me? Cute. I don't wanna go back to the hotel. Let's take one of these roads up to the canyon... and drive across to Mulholland or something. Can you pass me the cigarettes? They're on the floor. You didn't come. What is it? Get in the car, Maddy. Let's go home. Eddie, I'm your wife. Don't talk to me like I'm one of your fucking assistants. Just get in the fucking car, Maddy. No! Let's have this thing out now. Don't turn your back on me. You shit. I was just thinking it has to be more... than you just knocking my teeth down my throat. You know what I'm saying, Frankie? I mean it has to be more... You gotta give me something more. Just act and shut up. It's not about acting. It's about feeling. How can he act if he doesn't feel it? I don't know what you... That's the point. Where does it... What is it... What's the difference between acting and feeling? I don't know. Look at him. I can't look at him. How do you feel it unless you act it? You can't play a drunk unless you drink, right? So why? You gotta be in love with someone to be in love with someone. You have to deserve the privilege. - Right? - Right. "Deserve the privilege." "Deserve the privilege." It sounds like a tampon commercial. - It does. - Privilege Tampons. A hygiene deodorant, or something... for extra absorbency. I'd like to give you a Massengill douche about now. For when there's a heavy flow of bullshit, use... What was the name? What was the name of my super absorbency tampon? - Privilege. - Privilege. Thank you. What did you say your name was? Priv-ledger. For that heavy flow of bullshit. Extra heavy... - flow... - Are you on the rag or something? It's kind of like how you want him to act. - Like, flow, right? - Yeah. Except all he's given me is toxic shock syndrome. Hello? - You got it? - Yeah. It's for me. Maddy, I don't want to discuss anything now. I just wanna concentrate on my work. All right? My father... he had a heart attack. He's dead. I'm so sorry, Maddy. I'll make a reservation on the first flight home. No. Let me do it. Let me go on ahead... and make all the arrangements. - I love you. - I love you, too. You say do a pick-up, but... - Because the first moment... - The first moment is now. - "No more, Russell." - That's fine. - Okay. - You mind starting from the second thing? Because I want it to be a separate beat. The first beat, you got beautiful. Let's let the camera get to position. Camera's coming in. You're gonna tell me when to go? Keep going. When it's in here, 'cause the camera was in... I'll tell you when to start. Just a little tighter. Eddie, you like that? Okay. You okay here? - We're ready to go. - Can you regard the gun? - Then you let him have the line. - Roll, please. You're gonna do a thing like that, do it when you're sober. Be a man. You're in no position to be dictating comportment to me. You're so smart, Russell. You have it all figured out. You blow my brains out, you burn the house down. You kill yourself. All life's misery... Shit, what's the line? Okay, let's back it up again. - Okay? - Yeah. - Let's back it up again. - All right. Keep in mind, you're letting him have it, okay? Yup. - Same line? - Yeah. You're gonna do a thing like that, do it when you're sober. Be a man. Be a man? What's a man to you? Who the fuck are you to tell me to be a man, Sarah? You commercial piece of shit. Who the fuck are you, you commercial piece of shit, to tell me anything? - Who the fuck am I? - Yeah, do the lines. You commercial piece of shit, do the lines. Let's see if you can do them. - What? - Do the lines. You think you're so smart. Smarter than you. You got it all figured out? You blow my brains out, you burn the house down, and then you kill yourself? All life's problems solved in an hour's worth of misery. Is that what it is? Let's go back again. You commercial piece of shit, tell me how smart you are. Tell me how smart you are! How dumb I am. Come on, put those lines. Put those lines. I'm telling you what you are. If I left you on TV, you'd be selling toothpaste for the rest of your life. - That's what you think. - Yeah? Well, how smart are you? Who the fuck made you the smart one? How smart are you? Who the fuck are you? - You need me, I don't need you. - Oh, really? I only need you for your money. My life didn't begin when I fucking met you. Use the lines. Tell me. You think you're so smart. You got it all figured out. You blow my brains out, you burn the house down, you kill yourself. All life's misery solved in an hour's worth of effort. Bravo! And in the end, we'll meet in one of the seven circles. I'll be there for not doing what I could to help you. And you'll be there for doing what you could to stop me. - Is that what you want? - Yeah. Is that what you want? Yeah. That's what I want. Well, here, use this. Go ahead, come on. I want to see blood on your hands. You can't hide from the consequences of what you do. I want you to take a stand for the horseshit you believe in. Come on. Okay, cut. Rolling. Speak. You take him in, you take the gun and fire away, fuckface. Action. You like to see people hurt? You like to see people in pain? You like to ruin families? You like to take a family and rip it apart? In your fucking search for who you are? Don't make me laugh. You want the truth? You want reality? You want it to be real? This is the truth. This is the truth. Right here. Cut. You feel that? Come on, Burns. Come back. What the fuck are you doing? Would you care for some more wine, Mr. Israel? Listen. I asked you before... to throw away the scripts... and to give me something that was from you. Why don't you pick up the knife and stab this fucker! Who is Claire? You believe in that bullshit? Listen to me! You believe that Claire... would honor these vows. ; "Till death do we part"? Do you believe Claire would believe in God so much... to honor that vow. ; "Till death do we part"? What does it mean? What kind of death are we talking about? Physical death only? There's a spiritual death also. And you gave me Claire! I don't know who the fuck Claire is! I gave you an actress who just got her throat fucking cut, okay? Will you shut up and listen to me a second? You're not going to die, all right? Listen, Sarah, you're a very famous person. And people follow what you do. Now, do you expect young girls... Do you want young girls to do what you do as Claire? To let this fucking brute beat you? Shut up! Do you expect young girls to allow... Is that what you wanna teach them... to let this fucking brute beat you 'cause you believe in God? I'm playing a character. I don't want a character! Who is God? You mean, she does this because of God? - I'm describing a way of life. - Will you listen to me? You're not gonna get it unless you listen to me. The marriage vow is, "Till death do we part." He's killing her! Spiritually! You think the only fucking death is physical? Pick up that fucking knife and stab him! I asked you to throw the script away! And give me something from you! All you gave me was the script again. You gave me back the horseshit I gave you! - Hi, sweetheart. - You made it. - I caught the redeye. - You're so cold. I just have to get back tonight, we're shooting tomorrow. You should've told me you were coming, I could've called a car or something. - It's okay. You all right? - Yeah. It's been a rough week. Where's Tommy? Still sleeping. - What time's the funeral? - 11:00. - Want some coffee or something? - Yeah. Don't you think we should wake him up? I don't know. Let him sleep. I love you, Maddy. I love you, too. I slept with Sarah Jennings the day you came to L.A. A half hour before you got there to the room. She wasn't the first, Maddy. I don't know how many women there have been on the set. Sets. Actresses, models, wardrobe, makeup. I've done it all through our marriage... and I've concealed it from you. I tried to keep the truth from you, but... I don't want to do that anymore. I'm exhausted and I've just got to get it off my chest. What are you telling me? What the fuck are you telling me? Why are you even telling me this now? - I just can't... - This is my... What are you saying? I just can't live with this charade anymore. I just can't. I'm gonna lose my mind. I'm sorry it has to be today, but I just can't go on with this charade anymore. I just had to tell you. - Please. - Eddie. Eddie, why are you telling me this now? What the fuck are you telling me this for now? You think I knew this? You think I knew you were fucking Sarah Jennings... a half hour before I got there? It's not Sarah Jennings. I'm talking about me and you. I'm talking about our son. I don't know, I just... Our son? Tell me about our son. Things don't make sense to me anymore. You let me bring our son into a world... based on your fucking lies? Your fucking lies? Don't do that. Don't do what? Don't you do it. Who the fuck do you think you are, god damn you? What are you doing? What do you mean, what I'm doing? What the fuck are you doing? The truth? Let's talk about the truth. Tell me the truth. Let's hear the truth. You don't want to hear it. You slept with Sarah Jennings. You slept with actresses. It's not about Sarah Jennings. It's about me. It's about who I am and who you are. And what about Tommy? What about your son? What about this family we created? What about the commitment? What about it? I mean, you used our fucking child... to legitimize yourself in front of some blonde's eyes? Some bleached-blonde Hollywood bitch's eyes? And you're telling me this now? Damn, what the fuck are you? I thought you had a soul, I thought there was something in there. You've used our child, man. You're nothing but a Hollywood piece of crap. Get out. Just get the fuck out of here before I kill you, all right? No. Don't touch me. Why is the flowerpot on the floor? 'Cause Mommy missed me. - How are you doing? - Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Tommy, come on. Let's go take a bath or something. Let's get dressed. We have places to go to. Get the fuck out. I don't need anything from you. Get the fuck out of here. You want to explain it to him? Talk to him. Tell him. - Here, Tommy. - I gotta... No. Get over here. Explain it to him. You tell him what your life is like. No, get back here and confront your son. Get the fuck back here, man! I'm sorry. You all right? Listen. Don't worry about it. We'll talk it over later, all right? Mr. Israel, can I get you another glass of wine? Please. - There you go. - Thank you. I just want to tell you I really love your work. How kind of you. - Can I get you anything? - Yeah, they need some sushi back here. When I was a young man, I joined the Marine Corps... because I was very angry, very upset, very lost, you know... living in Brooklyn... and not able to find myself... And joined this place trying to find a way to deal with this rage. Looking for a war. Trying to find a war. Young Marines try to find a war... 'cause you wanna kill somebody. And then discovering there... along with this opportunity... to vent this rage, mindlessly, by the way. ; "My country right or wrong." Think of that. So doesn't matter if my country's wrong, I wanna do what they ask me, anyway. How blind can you get? But finding there, in this idea of Marine, a spiritual thing. My first venture into spiritual being was in the Marine Corps. He's a thief He's the robber of the seven seas What do you want to explain to me? He's a thief Do you want me to forgive you? He's the robber of the seven seas Do you want me to condone what you do? If you think duplicity is so admirable in a person... I want you to teach your son how to lie. If you think drugs and alcohol are so wonderful... then I want you to go out and buy some for our son. If you think infidelity is such a virtue in a person... then I want you to bring one of your girlfriends over here... and fuck her in front of your son. That's all I want from you, Eddie. Because a boy should learn from his father. You're a joke. No dignity, no self-respect. If you were any kind of a human being... you'd take this knife here... and you'd put it right through my fucking heart. Maybe then I might have some respect for you. Maybe. What are your plans when this movie's all over? What are you gonna be doing? I shouldn't make movies anymore. I should go to a lunatic asylum, right away. But I don't know, it's... Very much of it is too crazy and too... Just not what a man should do in his life all the time. And I feel... even if I get that boat over the mountain... and somehow I finish that film... anyone can congratulate me and talk me into finding it marvelous. Nobody on this earth will convince me to be happy about all that. Not until the end of my days. He wants it back, he doesn't want to let it go. It's this and it's that. It's that I wish I didn't need you. I wish the fuck you were dead. It gives me the goosebumps. You know? I wish you were fucking dead. I wish I didn't need you. - I wish I didn't love you. - I wish I didn't love you. So it's, like, remember this? That's what he's going through. Remember this? I bought this for you? He remembers it. He remembers what the love was like. And he's losing it. He wants it back. So why does he destroy it? There we have The Mother of Mirrors, I guess. That we can talk about probably for decades... how we destroy the only love... the love that we've all had in our lives and then fucked it up. Why? Lack of strength, lack of courage, fear? - What? - Despair. Despair. You want me to give up drinking? You want me to give up drugs? You want me to give up fucking? You want me to give up something? I can't give it up. You want me to give it up, but I can't give it up. And that love is withdrawing. It's dying. You know what I'm talking about, don't you? You're gonna do a thing like that, do it when you're sober.
