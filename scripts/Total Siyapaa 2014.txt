Control, man down. - Aman. Leave. Leave. What the hell are you doing? Leave. And who do we have here? Aman Ali. He's a Pakistani. And is that his only crime? He was talking about bombing, sir. And did you find something on him? We found these, sir. I suspect its some form of new language.. .they have started to use, sir. Looks like Arabic from an angle. Like here... ...and here. You see. And the girl? I want his clothes to be given to him right now! Right here, right now! - She's Indian. I feel she's her accomplice. Like an Indo-Pak operation, sir. And this guy looks like a terrorist. Mr. Percy? Don't they all? It's high time we did something about it, sir. It's high time someone put a straight jacket on you. You dumba. Release him at once and say sorry for your stupidity. Sure. Thanks. once again apologies, Mr. Ali. Percy. I am sorry, Mr. Ali. - Well.. Clearly the donuts aren't helping, are they? Let's go. Can't believe this. Bloody morons! I am going to put this on my channel. And Twitter. I am going to make sure those guys are sacked. How could they strip you off your clothes? And this is how they returned them. They could've at least ironed your clothes? - Sweetheart. we were at the police station. - So? Not at the drycleaners? - So. We can't take you home like this? We'll have to buy new clothes. Let me check. Listen, Asha, I don't think we should do this today. It's not a good sign. What? - Meeting your parents for the first time, what else? My mom called, they are already.. - Asha. It's not a good day today. I feel.. - Shut up and stop thinking. How can I stop thinking? Few minutes ago I was at the police station without my clothes. And now I am going to meet your parents.. ..regarding our marriage, and that too meeting them for the first time. Everything's happening so quickly, Asha. I haven't evolved from one shock.. ..and another's knocking at my doorstep. Take my advice. Let's do it some other day. - Relax. Nothing will happen. That's what scares me. What if nothing happens at all? I mean, I really want something to happen. I want to like your family and want them to accept me too. We.. - Will you shut up or should I make you? You do it. "You're like the dew drops." "Like the morning rays." "You make every season, blossom li ke spring." "Li ke words in a song." "Narrating sweet melodies." "When I blink, I see you in front of me." "Warm my cold breaths." "Turn around, sweetheart." "Your love means my entire world." "You dwell in my soul." "I am lost in your love." "Turn around, sweetheart." "I've witnessed God in you."

What.. okay, no matter what happens.. ..nothing's going to change between us. Promise? Promise. I love you. I love you too. Come. You never told me anything about your family.

Die! Very good, mom. You aren't ready yet? He isn't coming to see me. Wow, nice! You didn't cook all this when it was my time. Now don't say that your husband left you.. ..because, we didn't cook all this during your time. Sorry, dear. You see, I've lost my mind. I'm blabbering nonsense because I'm worried. No problem, mom, I'm getting used to it now. Don't mind. Go and put something on. And see where your brother is.. - Mom. Hello. Yes. What time's the class? I know. - Anjali, answer the door. Hi, Anjali. - Who are you? You didn't recognize me? - No? You don't know me? - No. Asha aunty. Mom, Asha auntie's here. Very good, dear. Let them in. Let's go. Hi.. What happened? - I am pregnant.

Yes, but not like her. How will our children be? They will be fine if they're like me. They will be fine if they're like you? Asha. - Coming, mom. Come on. Mom. Mom. - Asha. My sweetheart. Curse you, don't you get food to eat? You've lost so much weight. You look fine on the television. Mom, this is why I look fine on the television. Why don't you visit us every weekend? I yearn to see you. - Mom. And anyway, after you're married.. - Mom. Aman. - Greetings. Mom, you promised. Thank you, son. Your aunt had called, the wretch was saying.. .."Why a Muslim boy". I said "It's Asha's choice". End of discussion. Right, son. Will you keep Asha happy? Yes. Speak louder, we are Punjabis. Yes, yes, I'll keep her happy. That's more like it. Mom. Mom. I am going to kill this guy. This Pakistani's going to die by my hands today. Hey, sis. - Manav. What's up? - How are you? It's been so long. What have you don't to your hair? They really love each other. - Yes. Back in college, some boy teased Asha. When Manav found out, he thrashed him black and blue.. ..and, spent the entire night behind bars. Why are you screaming? That Pakistani who lives in the flat right below us. He parked his car in my space again and disappeared. That's how these Pakistanis are. They always park in the wrong place. Manav, Aman. Hey. Manav. Mom. Where's my hockey? It's in your room along with your baseball bats. But not today, son. We've guests at home. I know, I'll cut their cable connection. He won't listen. These Pakistanis won't stop making trouble. Go and meet grandpa. He's been asking since morning.. .."Where's Asha, when is she coming". Go. I'll just. What? What? You didn't tell them I am a Pakistani. I told them you're a Muslim. That means you didn't tell them I am a Pakistani. These guys hate Pakistanis. Easy, I don't want them to judge you.. ..on the fact that you're a Pakistani. That's it. - Some Pakistani took his.. ..parking space on the fact that you're a Pakistani. If I talk about you, God knows what he'll.. Relax. What relax? And who named him Manav? Daddy did. Aman, you're over-reacting. I am not...over-reacting. This is not about Hindu-Muslim.. It's about India and Pakistan. Will you shut up or should I make you? You do it. Nothing's going to happen. - I believe that too. Nothing's going to happen. You're laughing? - okay, I'll speak to them myself, don't worry. Please take your own sweet time and start... Start with your mother. And if possible, tell Manav over the phone a day or two later. What.. - Don't laugh. okay. Let's go meet grandpa. Speak louder, he's hard of hearing. of course he's hard of hearing. He's Punjabi after all. Not just that, he's actually hard of hearing. Come on. Confidence. Grandpa. Asha. How are you? - My dear.. I am fine. - Guess who's here? Guess who's here? - Who? Guess? - Who? Is he a boy or a girl? Grandpa, he's a boy. He seems frightened. Because he just met Manav. - I see. How old are you? - 28. 28! - What do you do? I play the guitar. Son, even I play the guitar. But what do you do? I.. I mean.. Aman is a musician, grandpa. - Musician. I see, no wonder.. You should exercise, son. - Yes. Look here. Made in 1930. In the 1971 war, I was shot here and here. Still, I didn't desert post. 13 days war with Pakistan. We defeated them. Why didn't you join the army? Even if I did, I couldn't have fought against Pakistan. Why? There are no more wars, grandpa. There will be, dear. There will be a war. "There will be!" Tell him. You said he's hard of hearing. Lee Enfield Mark 4. British infantry rifle. I killed 4 Pakistanis with this. The 5th shot me. Anjali, what are you doing here? Father, didn't I tell you not to do it. Let go of these bullets and take these pills. Why are you crying? Everyone's lost their mind. Pointing guns at children. No, no.. Don't cry. Sorry, mom, I didn't see. - It's okay, dear. Anjali, stop crying. Jia, stop screaming. What do you want, dear? - Band-aid. Why? Raj and Simran are hurt. You and your Raj-Simran. Come, I'll take a look. Come on, dear. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. We'll give you a band-aid. Come on, dear. Come. Sit here. Sit. Sit comfortably. Here you go, band-aid. What's this, mom? Anti-depressants. Anti-depressants? Why? The doctor has prescribed them, dear. He says it's best for sadness. Sadness? Dear, I went to see the doctor. I couldn't say anything. He looked at me for a while.. ..and then prescribed a medicine for me. What kind of a doctor is he? - He's Indian. But, what are you depressed about, mom? About what? Have you seen your sister? Have you seen your brother? Your grandma. Anjali. Have you seen your father? No. Where's dad? At the office, where else? He's been demoted, dear. The car just got smaller. He knows his future son-in-law's coming home. But he can come home only when his boss lets him. And you know your brother really well. I don't know when he's ever going to change? And your sister. She's a 5 year old daughter.. ..but she isn't responsible. She doesn't want to apologies to her husband.. ..and go back home. Why don't you explain her? Isn't her dance school doing well? That's the problem. I can't figure out the kind of friends she's made. They come home too. They look like goons. Why did you gesture at Aman? No, I didn't mean that. I hope you don't feel that we're a crazy family. No, I don't feel that at all. Why are you holding that? Give it to me. Who else do you have in your family? I have a father, mother.. .three brothers, four sisters.. ..and by grace of God, myself. And where in India do you hail from? What? India. I.. - Mom, he's a Pakistani. Who? - Me! "Hail Goddess." "All say, hail Goddess." "Everyone say, hai I Goddess." "Hai I Goddess." "All say, hai I Goddess." "Goddess, You're our only refuge." "Hai I Goddess." "All say, hai I Goddess." Mom, say something. What do I say? You two have lost your mind? You two have gone crazy? - Why? Why? Ashaa, up till Muslim was fine. But Pakistani? Asha, couldn't you find an Indian. Indians kill Pakistanis and Pakistanis kill Indians. We aren't doing anything like that. - Not yet. But you will do it later. This will never work, dear. - But it's working out. Because it's all new. Later you will strangle each other. Have you thought about your children? We have. Aman wants a daughter.. ..and we will call her Shanti. That won't bring any peace in your family. Have you seen Manav? I named him Manav - Human-.. ..but, he's turned into a cannibal. The beans are cooked. Jia! I'll take care of it. - I'll come too. You wait. Switch off the gas. And, there's soup in the freezer, keep it to defrost. Yes, I'll do it. See you. - See you. Mom, we love each other. To hell with your love. After 1947, there can be no love between India and Pakistan. It all ended right there. Mom. Can't even walk, but likes to play with a knife. Where's the soup? Is this soup or brick? I asked her to postpone the meeting today. Today is not a good day. But 'No', we've too meet them today. As if it's the end of the world. I wish I hadn't listened to her. The family's filled with fools. And now this is acting stubborn as well. Hi. What are you laughing at? Who are you? I came here with Asha. Asha's boyfriend. Yes. open your mouth. - What? Pakistani? How did you know? Well.. - Mom, can I please have some juice? Here you go. Never ever say please. - Why? Because...people will think you're a moron. Alright, listen this is the last.. No more juice. Who is it? Aman. Aman. Aman? Who? Aman, guitarist. The one who can't join the army, and.. ..even if he could, he couldn't fight against the Pakistanis. I see. Listen to this joke. - No. Son, listen to this joke. A patient goes to the doctor. He asks, "Doctor, how long do I have". The doctor says "10". The patient asks, "10 what". "Years, months, weeks, days." The doctor says "Ten, nine, eight, seven, six..". Wasn't that funny? It was a funny joke. Where are you going? Rascal, now try driving your car. oh, God! And you two will live in Karachi after the marriage. No, mom. London. Your children will be Muslim, dear. They won't be, mom. We've thought that, our children will decide.. ..which religion they want to practice. There will be no problem. - There's no problem yet. But when he gets a second, third and fourth wife.. .then you'll think that your mother was right. Mom, Aman believes in Monogamy. What "Gamy"? He won't perform anymore marriages. But you will change your religion, dear. I won't. And you will even change your name after the marriage. No, mom, I won't. And Aman's totally cool with it. Come to your senses. - What senses? What are you.. - Asha! Hey.. Hi! Why were you screaming? - I wasn't screaming. Mom was screaming because Aman's.. A Pakistani. You knew. I just met him outside. - How did you find out? I did, as soon as he opened his mouth. Aman. Aman. Aman. Grandpa, have you seen Aman? Aman, who? - Aman. The one who came with me. Have you seen him? - Him? Yes. I told him a joke, and he ran away after hearing it. Ran away. - Yes. Where? - outside. oh no. Who ran away? Aman ran away. Why? Don't you know why? All of you ganged up on him. Why did I come here in the first place? I shouldn't have.. - No, dear, you shouldn't say that. Mom, I wanted Aman to meet my family. But the truth of the matter is.. ..my family is not worth being introduced to anyone. No, dear, we aren't useless.. ..he's a Pakistani. Try to understand. Just.. Dear. Hello. - Aman. Asha, there's been a problem. Is it Aman? Give me, I'll apologies. - Hold on. Listen, the soup container slipped out of my hands.. ..fell out the window and landed on someone's head.. ..and, I think he's dead. What are you saying? Give me, I'll apologies. Hello, Amam. This is aunty speaking. Sorry, son. I over-reacted. It's okay if you're a Pakistani. Asha and you came to give us good news.. ..and we ruined your surprise. Sorry, son. Come up. Don't come up, I am coming down. Yes, okay. - Shall I come too? Mom, you just wait here. I'll get him. See...she's chosen a Pakistani. Unbelievable. Aman. - Asha. I thought you ran away.

If anything happens to him, you'll be arrested, Aman. - Your life will be ruined. - And what about his life? I guess he's.. And maybe not. The ambulance is coming and would take care of him. Come on. - This isn't right. You.. - We don't have an option, Aman. Please don't think too much. If anyone asks, tell them.. ..you came down to have a smoke. But I don't smoke. At least you can lie. Very less. But, whenever I do my ears turn red. I.. Don't say anything. Go get the container, until then I'll call the ambulance. Where is it? Father, have you seen the soup container? What soup?

Swear that you called the ambulance. You think I am lying. What kind of a person you think I am? I know what kind of a person you are. I don't even know what kind of a person I am. You're the idiot that.. .throws a frozen soup out of the window. Say it. Say whatever you like. You can all call me whatever you like. I am alone after all. Aman, why are we fighting amongst ourselves. I am sorry. I just came to meet you. And because you insisted. I told you it's not a good day today. Let's not meet today. "No, let's meet today." Since I arrived someone's throwing an orange.. ..or shooting a bullet, or abusing me.. ..or threatening me.. - Will you shut up or should I do it? I don't know what you should do, or what should I do? What is all this? I think that man's dead. No, it was an accident. It would've happened by someone else. What are you saying? -Destiny.

Come on. - Let's go, mom. Raging hormones.. Well, I think he has a concussion to the brain.. ..which means a loss of consciousness. Transient and prolonged due to the blow to the head. He has a weak pulse, so there may be a chance of amnesia. Vertigo, nausea. He has slow respiration. or it could be concussion to the lamebrynth.. ..which would mean deafness, swift tonituss ..due to the blow to the ear even. Not necessarily.. What? Hello. Yeah, put the date of.. We are just waiting for the next report.. Where did he go? I don't know. Damn! It has been two hours since and he hasn't reached home yet. You were right, dear. Mom. My mother used to say.. ..all men are the same. I never believed her. Rajinder was.. But it's true. All men are the same. I think we should call the police. It's not wrong to have an affair, son. No, mom, Aman's right. We should call the police. - Yes. Give me your phone. What? - Phone. I left my phone in the car. I'll get it. What's lacking in me, son? Tell me. I.. No, say it son. Is there anything lacking in me? There's nothing.. Am I not beautiful? - No.. Yes...I mean you're beautiful. You're very beautiful. You're gorgeous. Would you cheat on a woman li ke me.. ..and have an affair with someone else? You're Asha's mother. Forget that for a moment. - It's difficult. Try, son. I would never leave you. I would never go to work, and.. .therefore this wouldn't have happened.. ..if I wouldn't have gone to work in the first place. The police says they can't lodge a report.. ..before 24 hours. Where are you going? To see Rajinder's drawer. Lord.. Shameless. Fooling around in the office. Who...who am I? Who am I? Where am I? Asha. He's lost his mind. He even forgot that he's bald. Mom. Should I go right, or left? He looks stoned. The way tonight's going, I'll take anything. 'What am I doing here?' He's not coming. Yes, he is. 'No, let's go back.' No. 'Left. No straight.' Yes. No. Yes. 'I'll wait here.' What is up with him? Another psychopath. No, he's just shy. He needs his mummy. Yes. Because, if they're not psychopaths.. .they are 5 year olds. Hi, come here love. What's the matter? Are you going to stand there all night? Come, come, come, come. Come to mama? 'Who is she?' Mama? Mom. What happened to your head? 'How can she be mom?' I don't know. How much you got, love? 'She's scolding me so gently.' I don't know what happened. Come. Come inside. I'll find something to make you feel better. 'She's taking me home.' I never thought Rajinder would turn out like this. Why did I get married? If you hadn't then we wouldn't have been born. Rajinder makes me cry. All of you make me cry. My life's total loss, dear. No, mom. Aman's a nice boy, dear. But all men are same. Tell me if it stings. 'She's married.' What happened? Did you get into a fight? 'I am married too.' 'Is she my wife..' What are you looking at? What do you think I am going to do to you? Come, give me a hug. 'She's my wife.' That's it. That's the way I like it. 'Thank God, I found my wife.' 'But...I married a foreigner.' I don't know what happened? - There, there. Don't worry, you're with me now. okay. Look. You're going to have to give me some money. How much do you need? 100 Pounds. 100 Pounds? You got me scared. Well, do you have them? Do you want them now? Yes, of course. Why? Why do you think? 'My purse.' I don't have my wallet right now with me. Where is it? I don't know. Are you playing? I told you what happened. That's what I get for being so nice. I know, I must have.. I must have left it somewhere. I will go and find it. Well, go find it. Please don't get angry with me. - Hey, don't touch me. Tell me, is something wrong? Do we...do we have money problem? Yes, we have money problems. I have my father's watch. You can sell it for now. Wait here. Everything will be fine. Finished already. How much is this worth? Well.. Lap dance. I think. Enjoy. Did you find dad? No. - And these two? I won't eat you. Can't say. You're my future brother-in-law. - I see. So, what were you doing under the table? I was just joking. You guys are such stuck-ups. Us? You know what I mean. As if your liberty got you to the moon.

I mean I keep saying, but.. ..ultimately, she makes me do what she wants. I was saying "Let's not go today, let's not". But no "We have to, we have to". I said "The day started on a bad note". "Let's not go today." But no. I mean she's stubborn. Arguing with her is li ke.. - Getting Yes, getting . Exactly. Don't you abuse? A little. Where is it? Jia. Your dad.. Nothing will happen to dad.

I am not running a charity. Who are you? Do you know him? And you do, old man. Get in. Is he the person we owe money to? Yes, but that's all taken care of now. So, you can get off and find someone else.. .to spank your monkey. Monkey? What monkey? He's an idiot, or what? I am sorry, some other customers are waiting for me. Come back tomorrow, and we'll finish off, okay. What customers? Why tomorrow? What money? Why are you talking to me like that? Because she's in business. Business? Take that back. Take that back. You want me to punch your face in? You can't insult my wife like that. Come on. You're going to apologies to her. You're going to apologies to her. That's it. Why is he coming here? Apologies.

Asha. - Hello. Mom, I am afraid. - Where's Manav? He's gone down with daddy. - Why? Mom, grandpa's dead. What? What happened, dear? Anjali, listen. Stay right there, we'll be there. okay. What happened? - What happened? Grandpa's dead. What? Excuse me. Sorry, sorry, sorry.. - Get out of my way. Put some clothes on. Excuse me, what time is it? - Time. It's alright, never mind. 'Where's dad's watch?' 'She's the same girl..' 'This girl's..' Everyone ready? - Bravo. Come on. Go. Go on. once more. - Go, go, go. All the best, Manav. okay.Go. Run, run, run. You can't escape today. - We'll get you today. Get him. Pakistani, catch him. Today we'll.. Where are you going? - Where do I go? They're coming. Come down where? He's coming down quickly. Indians! Stop! Stop! Hurry up. Who covered his face? I did. Are we going to bury him or burn him? Father's looking so calm. What are you doing, father? You scared everyone. Curses. Come on, get out. Come on. Asha. Asha. By, God! It's a mad house. God knows where Rajinder is. Quit Anjali. Glory to Goddess! Freeze. You stinky terrorists. Who's he calling terrorists? You three, who else? How do you know? I feel he's addressing them. Shut up. Whom did he speak to now? - You three, who else? How do you know? I feel he's speaking to them. I said no talking. Who did he speak to now? - You three, who else? How do you know? I feel he's speaking to them. oh, shut up. You three, over here. You four, over there. No. Similarly, they sc us in '47 with divide and rule. You are right. - He's right. So, shall we take revenge? - Yes. But, Pakistanis will strike first. - Why? Who gave you the right? - I feel it's our birth right. Why, was he part of your dowry? We're elder. We got freedom first. Freedom? Let's toss. Get a coin. - You do. You don't have a coin? Give it to them. Give it. - Here you go. We're generous after all. Asha.. - Don't touch me. What happened? What were you doing with my sister? Nothing, she liked my song, so we.. You always have 100 excuses not to dance with me. Asha, please. What are you saying? - Please what? You were dancing with my sister after killing my dad. Killed your dad? Dad's dead? Asha, dad could've been saved if you.. - I killed dad. Yes, if you hadn't delayed in trying to hide it.. .then maybe dad would've been alive? I was trying to save you, you idiot. That's not our habit, to leave someone in trouble. our habit..? As if we kill people by throwing soup containers, don't we? I wouldn't be surprised if you did. Thank God you didn't say that the ISI is behind this. As if the ISI are really honest people. And the RAW are on a picnic in Baluchistan, aren't they? Those people who came in boats were from Pakistan. More people die in our country, we're more troubled. So? Will you trouble the world for it? osama was finally found in your backyard. Give us Kashmir, end of matter. You can't handle what we gave you. Give us Kashmir? Why should we? It belongs to us, you get out. Why should we get out? It's ours, you get out. You're seizing other's property, aren't you ashamed? Who teaches you all this? Don't you have a mind? - We live carefree. Not like you. We've a big heart. That reminds me of Shahid Afridi. After losing the semi-finals he said.. .the Indians don't have a big heart like us. So, should we lose the match? Even we...are worried about Shahid Afridi.. ..he must have said it under pressure. What's the big deal? - Yes. You're all so naive. If anyone says anything against Allah.. ..and you all set out for 'Jihad'. It's not a habit. We're always judged by our name, our religion. We weren't like this. People like you made us what we are. Turned you into someone who's burning their own homes? Don't force me. You have more scams than we've terrorist attacks. And you'll be surprised to know, madam.. ..more people die of corruption in your country. Come to your senses. - That's exactly what I was saying. What were you saying? What were you two talking about Rajinder? He passed away. The soup container slipped out of my hands.. ..fell through the window and landed on his head, and.. I don't get one thing. You're Punjabis, I am a Punjabi.. ..so, why make soup? You had to act like Britishers. What did you gain from it? Start calling the relatives. I'm off to the police station. Mom. Mom. Hello. Dad! oh, God! Mom, Its dad. Rajinder. Rajinder. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Rajinder. - Dad. Rajinder. What happened? - Dad. Dad, we thought.. Nothing. Where are your trousers? I found him like this in the streets. Thank you so much. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Dad, did you go to the hospital? It's really important, dad. Where have you been? I was coming home. - Yes. Then suddenly something heavy fell on my head. And...and.. And then? And then? Yes. No. Rajinder. Rajinder, do you recognize us? Yes. Who's this man? This is Aman. Aman, your dad. Welcome home, sir. Rajinder, lipstick. Mom! Sorry, sorry. I won't say anything. Come on, Rajinder. I'll get you some hot soup. Come on. This way. Dad. Careful. Tell me one thing, Rajinder, where's your pant? I lost it. Walk carefully. I'll take my stuff tomorrow. Where are you going? I don't know. Excuse me, where's A8. What name? Jai Singh. That's me. Thank you. Mom. - Yes, dear. Look, daddy. It isn't my fault, but... ...I wi ll have to say sorry. Say it. I am sorry. It's okay. Come on, let's go home. Aman. Turn around, sweetheart! Asha. We'll keep arguing all our lives, Asha. We'll live together for the argument. At least I can, Aman. I am a Pakistani and you're a Indian. But nobody's perfect. Can we live together? I know that...we cannot live apart. "Feels incomplete, sweetheart." "Why fight over trivial things?" "Why argue without a reason?" "You're the one I want to love." "You're the one I want to die for." "Asha." "Life's filled with a little intoxication." "Asha." "It feels incomplete without you." "It feels incomplete without you." Right, son. Will you keep Asha happy? - Yes. Speak louder, this is a Punjabi house. Yes, yes, I'll keep her happy. Curse you. "Tons of tears...and sorrows." "God, please tell us what do we do?" "Tons of tears...and sorrows." "God, please tell us what do we do?" "More pain, less relief." "No one's fine in this world anymore." "And then there's your parents, brother and sister." Where in India do you hail from? "Total chaos, that's your love." "It's completely crazy, I'm dead." "Total chaos, that's your love." "It's completely crazy, I'm dead." "Your mom hates me." "Your brother irritates me." "Daddy's always lost." "Your sister manipulates me." "Bunch of dacoits, always on a high." "This place of full of problems." "Still I didn't stop following you." Speak louder, we're Punjabis. "Total chaos, that's your love." "It's completely crazy, I'm dead." "Total chaos, that's your love." "It's completely crazy, I'm dead." "Tons of tears...and sorrows." "God, please tell us what do we do?" "More pain, less relief." "No one's fine in this world anymore." "And then there's your parents, brother and sister." "Total chaos, that's your love." "It's completely crazy, I'm dead." "Total chaos, that's your love." "It's completely crazy, I'm dead." Am I not beautiful? Since I arrived someone's throwing an orange.. ..or shooting a bullet, or abusing me.. ..or threatening me. .threatening me. The family's filled with jokers.
