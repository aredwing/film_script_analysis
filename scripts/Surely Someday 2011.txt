Honestly...school explosions! Stop this monkey business at once! Rebels will be beaten down, we are fully aware of that. Even so, we will not become the government's dogs! Much less behave the way high school wants us to behave! We are going to create a new Japan. That first step will be... A revival of the cultural festival! Yay... So it was because of something that stupid... What he told me was, "I decided to join a band so I could become ridiculously popular, but at this rate, I can't even lose my virginity." Yeah, thats what I heard too. You're saying the Cultural Festival is going to be cancelled starting this year? I went through rigorous training on the guitar because they told me I could get laid all the time. -How long are you planning on keeping me a virgin!? -He's getting completely worked up over nothing. 5 minutes to go! There are 5 minutes to go! 5 minutes to go? By the way, this time, the bomb is 10 times greater than the one we set off in the shed back there. This times 10? Wh- wha~? This school building, which has a 57 year history since its establishment, will go "BOOM!" in an instant. -Principal, this is bad. -I wonder how big the explosion will be... No thats... that's not the point! 3 minutes to go. Well then, 3 minutes to go! You're almost out of time. Even if you evacuate now who knows whether or not you'll survive? Vice Principal, let's do as they say. -Understood. -Let's accept. Fine! In accordance with your demand, we will approve of the decision of holding the cultural festival! Is it really OK, Vice Principal? Nice adults! The adults are nice! You guys have come to terms with the beginning of a new era. Thank you! Yuki, the timer! This is awesome! -That was the best! -Eh? The timer won't stop! What? What do you mean? It doesn't have any gunpowder in it though, right? I made him put some in. I made him put some in. Oi! What did you do that for! Why? I just went with the flow. Don't be putting in gun powder because of that! It's supposed to stop if I disconnect this part! Wait wait wait wait wait! Well then, cut this blue cord. -Is there a ground? -Nope (NOTE: like a kill switch) -Hey! Kazuo! -Let me go, Shuto! Yuki, calm down. What do we do? What do we do? There's 1 minute left! I told you, cut the blue cord! -I'm telling you, this will absorb the shock! -This is bad, Takumi! Shut up, virgin! So mean... and here I was going to say I saw this exact scene in a dream. Kyohei's foresight dreams are the real thing. What happened in the dream... It exploded. Operation X. -What's that? -We run away! Call me a genius, On the edge I'm a reject, But ain't gonna be Guilty Guilty. I gotta know, Why you wanna pin my pride, On your lapel. Gimme kicks Beat me back I'm up again, yeah. La La La, La La La. You'll see someday. Somewhere, A way to make Kyohei! Kyohei! Now... -Hey! Yuki! -Takumi! You idiot! I gotta get away You're gonna know Yuki! Yuki! Yuki! Yuki! Like this... This kind of face. I didn't look like that. You did too! Making an uncool face when it was only an explosion. Don't want to be told by somebody who wet their pants. You're wrong. I shit myself. Being arrogant won't make it better. Well, I also rushed Yuki though. Seriously, I thought he died. He didn't die though. But he did lose an arm. That's just a rumour though. Just because we haven't met since that incident, don't let your already damaged imagination run wild. When he so stubbornly declined our attempts to visit him, I can't help but let it run wild. That... that's true, but... Thinking about Yuki, not even as a masturbation joke! It gets depressing when we talk about him, so let's stop. You started it, you know. Since then, it's already been 3 years. You're living a unmotivated life. I can totally recite your past 3 years in 10 seconds. After all that, you started to work in the bar that your old man started up! What the hell?! -Don't be so calm, idiot! -Shut up, you still have the social standing of a virgin. What! What's with that tone of voice that sounds like you're saying virgins don't even have citizenship. Are virgins not allowed to have an opinion of their own? Huh? Can't they, huh? That's right. Huuuuh? If my 3 years can be summarized in 10 seconds. Your 3 damn years can be told in 8 seconds. You don't have a girlfriend that you can you be dumped by so you have virtual sex with a blow up doll every day. Then, since you wanted a real-life girlfriend, you took the university entrance exams, and miraculously got accepted into a 3rd rate university. However, you're still a virgin. Wai- wai- wai- wai... Wait! You don't understand the intensity of taking an exam at all, do you? How much sperm ejaculation do you think I denied myself while I was studying? Look who's talking when you haven't been able to ejaculate even now. Shut up! Ah... I wish a girl would come rolling by right about now... A girl...just came rolling by... Eh impossible! I can't speak English or anything! (Note: Kyohei is assuming she's American because of her blonde hair, which is not a Japanese trait) Then call the ambulance in Japanese! Oh, right. Takumi! Right now, it's 1:29! Not 117, 119! (NOTE: 119 is the number for fire and ambulance in Japan while 117 is time) Ah yeah! Ah... Are you OK? Hey! Hey! Hey, you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? You okay? Are you... Speak, speak. I'll take you to the hospital, okay? Wait a minute... wait a minute! What are you doing?! This can't be happening. You gotta be kidding me... Seriously... Hey, hey wait! Huh? What is this? A drama? Is it being filmed? Huh is there a camera? What? Where's the camera? Hey! You guys! We haven't seen anything! So we can't be of any help to you either! -So we aren't going to the police either. -Takumi and Kyohei...? Kazuo. No way! Y... You guys, just now...! Ah... Oh, never mind. Sorry, see you later! Shit... Hey! No way... Listen, listen well. It was like BANG! This blonde-haired woman went BANG into the car! It was like an impact scene from a movie! Cuz I totally thought it was a movie being filmed. But what came after was even cooler. That blonde-haired woman, she stole the handgun and car from a Yakuza and drove off. Further more, that yakuza person... Pfft. This is why I hate answering machines... Hey you, don't you go deciding that Kazuo is with the yakuza or something. -By the way, who have you been calling? -It's obvious, isn't it? Your mom huh? Get him, quickly! Oi! Come back here! (kora = an inducement to fight when used by members of yakuza) I wonder what happened with Kazuo after that... Yeah I wonder! -What? -This is coffee, yes? Always, always drinking coffee! What! Then put the coffee back down! Come on, put the coffee back down! Ahhh...! I wonder if that guy also had various things happen in these past 3 years? Since we left school we haven't met up with everyone... Alright then! Because we don't know of Kazuo's 3 years, let's guess. becomes unable to pay the hospital bills In order to earn money, he became a member of the yakuza. You know you, whatever the circumstances may be, I can't believe he'd be made to become one by such clichd motives. Exactly! Kazuo! Sorry... I'm going to hide. Are you being chased down by someone? My yakuza boss. There we go. I'm too old for this. (yokkorasho = something said when doing something strenuous) Just now, one of my underlings came in here right? Right? Kazuo... Kazuo! Kazuo! Kazuo... Kazuo! Kazuo! Kazuoooo! Kazuo... Ka-Kazuo... Kazuo... Kazuo... Kazuo Kazuo Kazuo Kazuo Kazu- oh come on... Don't make my crotch hot... Um, he's not here... Ah, is he hiding? You guys... are acquaintances of Kazuo? -He's a friend from high school. -Idiot! Ahh. I see. Well then, by tomorrow night, get Kazuo and the 300,000,000 Yen he stole ready. (~3 million USD) 3 hundred million? Well, we... My name is Kito. You write Kito with the characters "turtle head". Ok? Ok... Oh, if you break our agreement, you and your families... will be massacred. OK? You know me... Super bad ass Super bad ass Super bad ass Super bad ass You do have a door here. There is a door... You should have said so... That was unreal... Sorry, you saved me. Hey, what the hell is going on? Huh? -It's not like that! It's not like that! It's not like that! -You, 3 hundred million... I wasn't the one who stole it... You guys witnessed it. During the day you saw my car get stolen by a woman, right? That car was loaded with 300 million yen. But there's no way the Yakuza boss or the head boss will believe me. You seriously work for the yakuza? I had no choice. I needed that money for my little sister. Ah, you guys... Don't you dare tell her that. Aside from that, that woman from today, I've seen her before. I don't want to hear the saga about how you did it with some blond chick. That was a wig. She took it off in the car. That woman, is the woman that we went to Kabukicho to look for when we were kids because you thought she was your mother. (Kabukicho = the tokyo redlight district) Huh? Why is that woman... I don't know. I thought you guys might know something about this, but... And how many years ago was that? As if we're living such meaningless lives that we'd remember something that happened that long ago. The name of that establishment was "Happy Night". Dad, this person. Don't just enter a person's room without permission. She's a beautiful person, isn't she? Have you been going to meet her? [Himeno will wrap you up in the bubbles of her love] Could she possibly be My mother? [Dirty oneesan loves...] (NOTE: oneesan is a name given to a young woman whose name you don't know. It can also mean 'older sister') It doesn't concern you. -You found your mom, Takumi?! -Yeah. I thought your mom died right after you were born? -That's what I heard too. -That was a lie my dad made up. I've thought all along that they just got a divorce and she went away. So at last I've found her. An erotic magazine! Don't read it! Ahh waiwaiwait... This person is your mom? My dad never reads erotic magazines, but he's been looking at this and even has it circled. Highly mysterious. Himeno eh... But isn't she a bit young? So what will you do? -I'm going to go see her. -When? Obviously... now! For the composition we have to write for our summer homework what did you all write about? -If I remember correctly, it was about dreams for the future. -right. I wrote about when my amazing self will become the president! (NOTE: oresama is a very arrogant way to refer to yourself) -In Japan it's called being the Prime Minister. -Oh ah... really? What about you, Shuto? I want...to date a celebrity. As you'd expect from the son of a distinguished family of a top-notch enterprise! -Kazuo will be a martial artist, right? -Yeah, I've done 6 years of karate. And because my sister's cheering me on too. I'm going to make a life-sized Gundam! That's definitely impossible! -It's more likely to come true than your dream! -Shut up! What about you, Takumi? I'll... I'll go to meet this woman! What do you mean ''this woman''? Isn't she your mom? Right then, a race to Kabukicho. Last one there has to treat everyone to GariGari-kun! (NOTE: GariGari-kun is the popsicle they were eating) There's no way you can win against Yuki's remodelled bike. Yuki start the turbo! Turbo! Ok! Ping! Go go go go go~! Bye bye! Bye~! Good bye! Hey what? Why are you yelling like that all of a sudden?! What's wrong? At turbo speed, the tyres aren't able to hold out! Woah! -What is this? -Hey! It's smoking! But I don't understand~! It hurts! [Kabukicho District] -Isn't it that way? -Huh? -What's this... -It says "Do not pee." Ah it really does say that... Oh! An apple! You can't! You always want to eat something or another. By the way, I've got a yen coin, (~1 cent). If you leave money here, I wonder if your wish comes true. No way. (Vertical yellow and pink sign) [Cute girls will take you away to a dream world] (Small white poster) [Do not pee!!] Hey, I wonder if we can get in with child fare. Nope, definitely not possible. Hey! (Yellow and pink horizontal sign) [Soapland (brothel where one can bathe with prostitutes) [Happy Night] (Sign on left)[Bathing fee (90 minutes) 25,000 Yen (~250USD)] (Red and white vertical sign) [Recruiting of Companion Available.] Shoo! Geez... what are there brats doing in a place like this? Um, we would like to meet Himeno. Huh? -We'll wait here. -Why! We get to see a naked lady! Takumi, I hope it really is your mom. Yeah. You are my child? Now that you mention it, your eyes may be similar to mine. Hm? I'm only joking of course. Just how old do you think I am? There you go. Is it because you read this? Silly. Your father is just a customer. You know what kind of place this is, right? I'm sorry, after you came all this way, but... I knew all along, that you aren't my mom. I knew that. If that's the case, then why are you here? I started wondering if... my dad fell in love with someone other than my mom. Don't worry, your dad, can distract himself from feelings of loneliness by coming to see me. No one will fall in love with someone like me. I bet I have nicer boobies than your mom. I wouldn't know! I've never touched them... Well then, Would you like to feel and see them properly? How is it? It's warm. This is kind of nice, isn't it? It... would have been nice if you were my mom... What does your dad work as? A detective. What...? Ahh good good... Ijima! The police are coming! Hey! -Police. -Wh- What are you... -Sorry, sorry. -What a second! What is this? Get out of the way! Hey, hurry hurry! Hold it right there, Ijima! -Dad! -Takumi...! Get down! Takumi! Get down! Ijima! Takumi! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Takumi! Hey what happened in there? What did you come here for? Why were you in such a place! Oi! Getting in the way of the investigation, you stupid boy. Hey... Like I said, no one will fall in love with someone like me. I've become soiled... You are pure. (Kirei can also mean pretty/clean etc) I like you. If you grow up, will you take me as your bride? One pain Definitely. One pain Too far, You laugh, You live, I'll protect you. you know the future is all we have left you know the future is Thank you. Thanks to you, I have been saved. What is this. What did you do? No explanation? You punks, what have you done? You remember that lady from Kabukicho 10 years ago, right? Come again? Geez... You guys aren't poking your heads into something that isn't your business again, are you? That's got nothing to do with it. If that's got nothing to do with this, I wouldn't be running a gloomy bar like this. That's right. It's my fault you retired. You guys keep licking each other's wounds your entire lives. See ya, losers. Hey. Make sure you clean this up properly. That's it! Alright! Fine! We're going to stop blaming everything on that incident and from running away from ourselves! We are getting that 3 hundred million back. We're going back to being the idiots we were during the best times of our lives! Huh? -We'll look for that woman! -H- H-... How are we going to do that? Huh? How should I know? If things like that can just pop out of nowhere, I wouldn't have been going to the same high school as you. Stop it you guys! Stop! Takumi! What did you just say, you muttsurisukebe?! (NOTE: Muttsurisukebe is a closet pervert) Huh?! Let's do it! Will you give me Oh, baby shame me, And I know they say Oh, baby save me, Comrade, sighted! Let's take Cuz we both know That guy is also one of us. I think it's If everything went accordingly, he'd have been able to graduate from a top-notch university and would have become the president of a company at some point... Hey thank you. Thank you! Yeah! I'm having fun doing this, actually. If that's really the case, we wouldn't have come to you with this. That's what you say, but you just want some company, right? Saw through that one, huh? It's unfair that you're the only one who isn't putting their life on the line! Huh? Right then! Are we going to do this with low spirits or high spirits? Which is it? No matter which, aren't you still going to do it? -It's settled. -Sheesh... Well, I'll go along with it to kill some time. -So, what lead do we have? -Ah... if that's the case, there's a picture... I tried to faithfully reproduce Kazuo's image of her. What year were you intending on finding her by? Eh? What is it? What? Well, doesn't it resemble her though? -Kazuo, is this really your image of her? -The problem was your image of her. I let you draw because you said you were good at drawing. Your impression was bad though! It's not my fault! -Here's a cutout! -Huh?! -If you had this, bring it out much sooner! 1 2 3 4 5 6... 10 years! That's disturbing! That's why I didn't want to show you! Do you...love her? That's not it! You're so easy to figure out... Is this some kind of manga? Are you in love? Are you in love? Takumi. Hey Shuto, Takumi that's definitely... -What? What's wrong? -Huh? Oh, no nothing... [Nurse Call] [Cabaret Club] [Toys] Just joking! I was just going with the flow! [Toys] [Free Information Desk] Let's go that way! [Free Information Desk] [Free Information Desk] Have you seen this woman? [Strawberry Jam] [Strawberry Jam] -Thank you very much. -Thank you. Please come again. Woah, nostalgic! Just like before, 1 yen wasn't it? If you're listening to your voice mail at least send me an email. Oh today, Shuto has joined us again after 3 years. But, we don't have any leads. Still, I'm going to find them in no time. Don't worry. Calling your mother again? Shut up... Hey. How was it? No good. We've got nothing either. ''Happy Night'' is already gone too. It's already been 10 years, so there's bound to be limits of how much we can find. Hey guys... Oh crap, it's the head yakuza boss... Oi Kazuo! Oi! Run! Eh? Ruuuun! Come back here! Hey Takumi! You bastard! It's dangerous to stand in the way! I don't have any money! Hey! I mean, how did they know of our location! Wasn't the agreement until tonight? -He can change his mind pretty quick -As if I would stand to being killed over a change of mind! The woman's real name is Misa! -How do you know something like that? -Remember Miyagi-san? Miyagi-san, you mean that Miyagi-san? Misa-san is Miyagi-san's woman. But how do you know something like that? 3 years ago! how does she come out an old geezer? [Wigs, just in][Magazines] (Note: ossan = rude term for middle aged man) Even though they searched the toilet for the figure of a woman, she was no where to be found. In other words, somewhere in the toilet, there was a sex change device. Are you serious?! Serious? Are you serious? You mean to say, you, Yas-san, can turn into a hot woman, (he says 'bodekon onna' which means 'a woman wearing sexually flattering clothing', comes from 'body conscious') with huge breasts? No way! Is that so... I can also turn into a hot woman... Takumi. Can he really flirt with a 100 percent success rate? There's no way he can make them swoon in only 5 seconds. Well, just watch. No one's coming... They're coming! They're coming! He went! He went! He seriously went! 5 4 3 2 1... Woah! They fell for him! Idiot idiot idiot idiot! Kame Sennin! Teach me too! (Master Roshi from Dragon Ball, he trained warriors) You just have to have the "look" He was bad, you know What's your favourite (sexual) position? It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! Ugly cow! Ugly! You're an ugly cow! You guys are really such ugly cows! Don't don't don't. Stop that. Are you trying to not let me fight back? Wait, wait, wait, stop. Oui! Hey! Hey... why don't we start a band? -A band? -We'll debut at the cultural festival. Before this, you were looking at that street musician... His name is Miyagi-san. And... It was also Miyagi-san who suggested we should start a band... What, you're already his apprentice? Who is this Miyagi? You were too busy with the girls that you weren't listening that time, were you? That ugly cow. Well if we're going to do this... I'll be guitar! Then I'll be vocals! Ah, then I'll be drums! Then I'll be bass! Ah, wait, eh... I overheard you're plan. Ah, time out for a second. Ah, Dad. If you've got questions about starting up a band, ask me. You know how to play a musical instrument? I may look like a geek, but yeah, I'm pretty good. Back in my days, I had a lot of skill. Woah! That's awesome! You really can play guitar! Of course. Alright! Then are we serious about doing this?! -Yeah let's do it! -Let's do it! I won't do it. Ah come on, you're sulking again. -Ah man, I got the shin again. -That's too bad... If we form a band for the cultural festival, we'd be popular though... We'd get love confessions from left and right and get laid all the time. I'm not sure about that. You guys, better pull your weights, got it? For this year's cultural festival, we'll start a band! And get laid all the time! Yay! Yeah! Is practice for the cultural festival going well? Yes. Thanks to you. I feel like I've found my passion, something I can be absorbed in, for the first time. Ah, lame isn't it. It's so lame. Even if something's lame, don't go making everything into winter. (NOTE: "samui" = lame, but literally, it means "cold", so Tasuku is making a joke out of this) Tasuku. Oh. Isn't my girlfriend a beauty? Nice to meet you. Have I met you somewhere before? Oi! Don't try hitting on her. Huh... maybe I'm imagining things. Hey, come on. What? I can't do that. Come on, imitate and just follow me, here we go. F#m (F sharp minor) A E Yuki, Yuki. This is definitely the music shop! Come on go! Go! Go! Don't get so excited. Stop it. Yuki, buy this, you have to buy this. Huh, but so expensive. Let's go home, I'm hungry. Let's make a band. Let's make a band, Let's make a band, Let's make a band, "Tomorrow... what will happen?" (NOTE: he's writing lyrics) "Won't the breeze of tomorrow blow again?" Let's start a band, Let's make a band, We're scum, We're scum, We're scum, We're scum, Thank you!! I wrote the lyrics, but would you please write the music? I don't want to~ What? Why should I write the music for you guys? Eh, please write it for us. -Isn't this different from what you said before? -It's ok, he actually does want to write it. I'm busy you know. -I know you really do want to write it! -Well please at least read this. -No~ -I promise you, it's good. Fine, but I'm only going to read it. Thank you, thank you! Make sure you cheer for us at the cultural festival too! Don't you know? From this year, we're getting rid of the cultural festival. The music you told me to write, it's almost done. If there isn't going to be a cultural festival anymore, there's no point. It doesn't matter. So long as you have an instrument, anywhere can become your stage. Love and peace! Rock isn't about hurting someone's feelings. It's about being loved by someone. You were saying before that because it was destructive, it was rock... I'm thinking of getting together officially with Misa. Eh? The hell...? Yo~! Oh. We're having a strategy meeting. I'll be right there. Later. Hello. Hi. Well then, I'll be going too. Shuto! Make sure you produce a sound that people will love. You're late! Come on, hurry up! We'll block off the classroom. We'll barricade ourselves in, and request the revival of the cultural festival from the adults. I'm starting to get excited! Is it really ok to do something like that? Of course it's not okay. I can hear everything, you know. I suggest you stop this stupid plan. Your dad seems off lately. Normally, he'd be all for it, saying "I'll join you!" Yeah. Ever since he become a branch manager of the bank, he's been acting strange... Hey... how about a bomb! Then, if we threaten them, it's a home run. Nah, I think it'll be enough to just barricade ourselves in. Idiot. We want to get to the point across quickly, or else Cultural Festival season will be over. And so, Yuki, make the bomb. Huh? Can't we use this? We throw this on the ground and white smoke comes out. Really?! Yep, rejected. Give it here, confiscated. Well then, how about doing it like this? First of all, we blow up the shed in the schoolyard. Then, in the classroom, we put a bomb that doesn't have any gunpowder put in it. Ah, then we'll just make it to threaten them. Fine then. I'll do it. You guys! School explosions! This monkey business... stop it at once! Ah, excuse me. How's the situation? There hasn't been any movement from them yet. Fuck you! Sex! This school building, which has a 57 year history since its establishment, will go "BOOM!" in an instant. 3 minutes to go. Well then, 3 minutes to go! -It's no use, let's accept their demand. -Understood. Fine! In accordance with your demand, we've approved the decision to hold the cultural festival! Yuki, the timer! That's a relief, isn't it. -Eh? The timer isn't stopping. -Eh?! It doesn't have any gunpowder in it though, right? I made him put some in. What did you do that for! Yuki! Hey, run! Why didn't you say so back in high school? I didn't realise at that time. So I was shocked when I saw the photo. I wondered why Misa-san... Also, because you said you have fallen in love with her and such. I didn't say that. You haven't seen Miyagi-san after that? No. After that incident, I've also stopped going to that place in front of the station, although, I happened to see Misa-san several days after that. Where? At Yuki's old man's bank. At the back entrance, she was talking with him about something. What?! With his old man? Want to go to Yuki's house and ask about it? Oi, don't drag him into this too. No, we should go and see him. He might know something. I'll pass. I wouldn't know what to say to him even if I do meet him. If we don't, nothing will change and we won't be able to move forward. It's really been a long time. Have you all been well? Here you go, help yourselves. Uh... We are searching for this woman. Apparently she was seen coming out from the bank where your husband used to work. I wonder if it was one of his clients. Ah... if it was him, he'd have know right away, but... I'm sorry. Ah... here, eat. How's Yuki? Ah... he's the same. He hasn't even taken one step out of the house. He completely shuts his heart and I think he believed that it was because of the explosion incident that his father took his own life. The cause of his death... I'm not sure. Oh but, it's definitely in no way your fault. Because that guy, you know, he loved all of you. Oh, eat. Ah, about Yuki's arm. Now's not the time for you to talk about that. What are you talking about? Ah, well, in the explosion, we heard that he had lost his left arm. Huh?! Nothing like that happened. Both his right and left are perfectly fine. Eh? Eh? Huh? What? I'm going to the toilet. Ah... wait a second... What was that about? Yuki, it's me. So you're ok, I'm glad... Ah, have you listened to your answering machine? It's filled with meaningless messages, and might be uncool and all but, I'm still going to keep it up. Ah...the smoke bomb you made, the one where white smoke comes pouring out... Ah...I forgot to return it to you. But, I need to borrow it a little bit longer. Yuki's mom also doesn't know why he committed suicide... Yeah... Still... Yuki seemed to be doing alright. Yeah. He's not alright though. His arm may be there, but he still won't come out of his room. I didn't know he felt that guilty, over the death of his dad... That time, I shouldn't have made him put the gun powder in... Why did I make him do something so stupid?! Eh? Tsh, and just when we were having a serious conversation I stepped on some gum. Come on... Or so I thought. It was shit! Don't fucking kid around! This guy is the worst! You smell! You got a bit on me just now! The worst... it stinks... Now we're the same. I don't have any money! We know. What is it, Yas-san? Have you forgotten about me already? And here I even respected you. Wait... Toshihiko? It's Kyohei. At least remember that much! Yas-san, we wanted to ask about something that happened 3 years ago. 3 years ago? Ahh~ you mean when the sex change device was in fashion? -Yes yes yes yes. -It wasn't in fashion. It didn't even exist! Do you remember the person that used to sing over there before me? He was with this lady here. Ah, I remember. I often got bento from him. Bento? He worked at a bento store part-time. Then he got kidnapped, and I haven't seen him around since. Taken away, by who? Some bad looking guys. They threw the guitar-playing guy and his girlfriend into a car and drove off somewhere You said you got bento from him. Do you know where the bento store is? Ah, I know but it's hard to explain. -What what what, wait you guys... -On 3!1, 2, 3... Go! Hey I don't have any money! Miyagi-kun isn't here anymore. Did he quit? I...I don't know. You don't know... Thank you very much. What do you mean, you don't know! I don't know what I don't know. Well leave already. It's weird that you don't know whether the person you were working with actually quit or not. Come on! I'll call the cops for business disturbance. She's definitely hiding something Yeah... Shuto, make her swoon. Huh? But that's strange, you used to work with him, right? Huh? But that's strange, you used to work with him, right? Go, go! But that's strange, you used to work with him, right? But that's strange, you used to work with him, right? Leave! Hurry! What is it... 5 4 3 2 1... She's falling... Did something happen to Miyagi-san? I dont know all the details but, I heard that he's already dead It's already been 3 years... Please tell us Miyagi-san's address! Miyagi-san lived here... There's no door plate, he isn't here is he? She said he died already. But this is the only lead we have Miyagi-san! Damn it, it won't open! What have you done? You big dumb muscle. Don't you know the words 'property damage' and 'trespassing'? I'll be in the car. Excuse us. (Ojamashimasu = phrase said when entering someone's house, literally "I'm intruding") Hey, Kazuo. Hey The song we asked him to write for us... He really wrote it September 12th... 9/12 3 years ago, he was still alive. Ah shit... Hey, Kazuo! It's the worst we feared... [Miyagi-san's posthumous name] (note: In Buddhism, the deceased have different names to when they were alive) [Miyagi Tasuku] [died 9/15][35 years old] September 15th... [Miyagi Tasuku] [died 9/15][35 years old] Today! Huh? 9/15 3 years ago... Wasn't that the day of our explosion incident? Hey... Hey! Oi! Takumi! -Where are we going? -Shut up! You won't understand even if I do explain it. What is this... the virgin doesn't have the right to know either? Alright then, how about you solve this mystery without the help of this elite university student? Let's see you make a woman appear, just like a magnificent illusion! Huh?! An illusion... We're not mistaken! It's this woman! At last we met Misa-san... Shuto-kun? Hey, wai-wait a minute! Don't leave me behind! How did you know she would be here? The reason that incident happened yesterday wasn't because it was a coincidence, but because it was meant to happen. I have no idea what you're talking about... Do you remember? Us, I mean. 10 years ago, some kids went to Happy Night in Kabukicho. We are those kids. After that, how did you end up stealing 3 hundred million yen? Could you please tell us? I spent 6 years in prison. (Kanto Prison No. 2) Don't come back here again What's your favourite (sexual) position? Ah! It hurts! It hurts! What did you do that for, you ugly cow! Ugly! Hey. If it's ok, do you want to go for a drink? A real pretty woman dropped me a great amount of money. I want everything to be over already... That would be a waste. You've gone through so much, your life can only get better. No, all that's left is to die. Someone like me doesn't deserve to live. If you die, I'll cry. But, I wonder if that's worth anything? It's not like you can't restart your life though. I also don't think it's full of bad things either. Just like how you and I met today. It's finally it tomorrow. The day the producer will come listen to you Yeah. If that goes well... let's get married. Huh? And if I save up enough money through that let's live in London together where no one knows about it. So? Hey, Don't be so anxious. Ahh... I'm totally nervous... At Kitagawa highschool, some students have a bomb and have barricaded themselves in! We're going! Senpai, what about this place? (senpai = term referred to someone higher than you 'senior' etc) Just leave it! We'll try to gain control before back up gets there. They seem busy, don't they... Seems so... Are you really not nervous? I'm not. Eh... I am nervous! Why are you nervous, Misa? Ijima! What! Don't touch me! Let me go, wait a minute! Let go! No! Let go! Let go! Hey! Somebody, help! Policeman! Policeman! Help! No! No! Stop! No! No! Someone! Anyone! The police! Call the police! Police... Phone! Cell phone! Cell phone! -No! -Misa! in order to set Tasuku free, You know what money laundering is? Money laundering? Illegally earned money is moved around repeatedly between fake bank accounts, so it can be spent without being connected to the way it was earned. I was entrusted with that job by Ijima So, that's why you were at the back entrance that time? The branch manager before that guy, got dismissed because they found out about this plan. I can't let you do as you wish. that branch manager felt responsible, That branch manager, in his will, brought to light the reality of the money laundering. What! If that was the reason for his suicide, -why wasn't that properly conveyed to his family? -Kyohei! The size of the organization involved in this case is extremely large. To the extent where a case like this can be easily hidden. Ijima, being the part of the organization at the time Could not be defeated just because of this one case. Ijima killed the ones involved in this organization and fled overseas. Because Ijima wasn't here, I was set free. And then... for revenge... However, I couldn't find him... Apparently there was a yakuza boss called ''Ijima'' before but, the yakuza boss now is called Kito! Even if you came after me it won't make for any kind of revenge! I see! Is that's how it was. Why here...? The cell phones that the (yakuza) group gives its members, has a GPS function on it. So you wanted to meet Ijima We don't have matching watches! Ijima... Now I'm known as Kito. Written with the characters for 'turtle head', Kito. Kinda like a nickname. I've changed quite a bit, haven't I? I got a lot of things ''fixed'' while I was overseas. Face, hairdo, skeletal structure, skin. Hey... Look, this leg. In order to change enough of my appearance, I even had my leg cut off What pain! But I had to change so I could come back to Japan. I really worked hard for it! No matter what, I've been wanting to see you. Where have you been? However, I'm happy that you were the one actively looking for me I wanted you to remember what day today was! What? Huh? What day could it be? Hey, you! I won't forgive you. These last 3 years... How much I have hated you... This is the toy gun you stole from Kazuo? There's no way I'd let a brat hold onto a real gun Kazuo, take the gun. Take it. Kazuo. Take the gun! The money is also here. Ah, you guys, I appreciate your efforts, I give you my thanks. Why? Why did you kill Miyagi-san? It's obvious, isn't it? He tried owning another guy's property Ahh, that's right, Because you have found out my secret. For you guys also, everyone will be killed. I'll leave the rest up to you guys What are you doing? Hey! We'll totally kill you. Who will be the first... This is the end for you. It's hurts... Idiot! Wait, come here! It hurts, it hurts... Operation X! It was nice working with you all!! Kazuo! Hurry up! Kazuo give it here give it here! It's heavy! Oyas-san! Oyas-san! (Oyas-san short for Oyabun = Father = Yakuza Boss) You took your time! Sorry! You should have just left me there! Why? Why? Why why why? Shut up, virgin! Shut up! So mean... They're coming! Stop, you! You bastard! Shut up! That's enough! Let me off If I go back, Ijima won't- -Like I would let you do something like that! If I go back, Ijima won't- I want happiness for you. Why would you do something like that for me... No! It's for our sake We're the ones who caused the explosion incident 3 years ago If we hadn't done something like that back then, There would have been a policeman at the police box Miyagi-san wouldn't have been killed Even so... This time for sure... This time for sure, we want to protect you. Ahhh! Ow! Shit! Earthquake? What are you still doing here, Yassan? Don't fuck with us, you bastards! What are they doing, those idiots. Give them a scare. Right My crotch is throbbing. Hurry hurry hurry! Run! Shuto! Sorry. So sorry! Hey, come on, where did they go! Hey! There they are! They're coming, they're coming, they're coming! Wait come back here! Cover your head! Cover your head! Hurry! They're coming this way! This way, this way! Hey! You bastards! Raise your hands. Next time, I'll really shoot. There's no escape now. I don't have any money! Make sure you give me back my clothes! Yassan! Swap clothes with Misa-san! Huh?! Just do it, swap clothes! What for?! Kyohei, you cover the back! Serves you right. Kyohei! Kyohei! Kyohei! Kazuo! Here Here! Ladies and gentlemen! It's showtime! Hey! Woah! Yahoo! Come on, let's go, you! Come on... Ahh, what nice expressions I'm having an erection all the time! A constant erection, a constant erection! I'm having a constant erection! Takumi... Who said you could talk! Shall I kill you first? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! This is a masterpiece Say it more, come on, come on, come on, come on. Say it again come on! I'm sorry! Again! Sorry! Again again again...! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please forgive me! I'm sorry! Sorry! Lick my shoe. I will really shoot, come on! The best! It's the best! Well, next, I'll get you to suck this. Eh? What are you waiting for, hurry up and suck it. Please don't make me What's wrong? You just have to take it and hold it in your mouth. You took too long. Prepare the money and Misa by tomorrow. If you can't, all your internal organs will be sold. OK? Oh by the way, running to the police and squealing, will get you and your families massacred. Ok? Thank you very much everyone! Big round of applause for the little ones. Shit! Be quiet. I'll tell your sister that you're working for the yakuza. It would have been better if Kazuo hadn't come. If Kazuo hadn't come... it wouldn't have to end like this. If you hadn't come, it wouldn't have turned out like this, you know! If you hadn't come, it wouldn't have turned out like this! Hey! It's your damn fault! Stop it! It's your damn fault, you know! Let go! Let go! Let go! You guys think I am pitiful, don't you! "We're going back to being the idiots we were during the best times of our lives!"? You're fucking kidding me! Because we're idiots, We ended up in this situation! Nothing has changed in the last 3 years! Kyohei... Enough. What. Why are you trying to look good. You're turning into an obedient guy. Just 'cause you're feeling responsible for your dad's forced retirement. The same goes for you. Always using your sister as an excuse Quit running away! Those are just excuses! Quit running away! Quit running away... Hey, Kyohei. It's the same even for you. Even you, even you... Even you! Even you... Even you... Enough. That's enough. I'm scared... I'm afraid... of living my life. If days like this are going to continue, I would really rather die. Liar! You! Weren't you trying to survive? Even enduring such humiliation, Weren't you desperately trying to live? I know. How you struggle a lot in the shadows, and how you got into university. How even if you were called a criminal in university you would act all cheerful in front of us. "Surely someday..." just like that. It's okay to live life with those words concealed in our hearts. Your life, we will make sure you live it. We're scared too... but the reason why we can still laugh like idiots is because we're all here. We understand... each other's pain. You guys, are so lame. That's true. The air-conditioning is working too well. (This is the same pun from earlier, samui = lame/cold) That's what you call lame Huh? Geez. What is this mud doing stuck like this... or so I thought, it was shit! It was shit! Stop it! Why does this only happen to me? Go that way. -Why is it always me... -Quit joking around. How about we rob a bank? I wonder if I'm now able to produce a sound that people will love Big brother? Ah, sorry. Did I wake you? Did something happen? Huh? Ah...just a bit at training Don't over do it, ok? I'm really happy now. Because you work hard enough for the both of us. It feels like I'm also Chasing a dream with you. I...see... I just wanted to see your face, so Good night. Now you know Your dad, died for the sake of justice. Tomorrow, we're going to go and rob your dad's bank. Because of that, we'll get arrested and imprisoned. There's no other way to escape from the yakuza. So, my answering machine diary will be postponed for a while. Tomorrow, we're going to finish off The one thing that has been left undone Yuki... Sorry. Geez, it's the last day, but there's no one here. Thank you for taking care of me. (Note: Takumi is saying goodbye to the radio/tv that has probably kept him company every night for the past 3 years.) Did you see a dream where we got caught and handcuffed? Nope, for some reason, I had a dream where you were going out with Ueto Aya. (Note: Ueto Aya = actress) Never mind, Kyohei's foresight dreams can't be trusted. You can't rely on this guy in general. What? Speaking of which, I wonder if the sex change device was real or not. I'm telling you, it is real. However, if it really did exist, what would we do? If a sex change device really did exist, we might have been able to live life over again. Not me. I'm fine. Sorry That I'm late... You're late. The fact is, you're late! I hope you guys practised properly. Of course! Last minute cramming is my area of expertise! That reminds me, we haven't really thought about the title of the song. It seems that Miyagi-san thought of one. su... re rii so... Surely Someday. It means "itsuka kitto". Good title isn't it? Shall we do this? This performance is dedicated to Yuki's dad and Miyagi-san. How many mornings, How many lies, Fuck you! Sex! What? Huh? And you are? She confessed everything. On top of that, Ijima's money laundering, has all been recorded on here. Today he'll make a huge transaction. In order to withdraw funds, he will definitely show up at the bank in person. If these transaction details match, we should be able to assemble a case. Your efforts are finally bearing fruit. With this, at last Ijima will be arrested. It took 10 years Also, that woman... I understand. She'll be taken care of. He did some bad things to her. She spent 6 years in prison as Ijima's sacrifice. With this a little of the weight on my chest will be lifted. What is this...? What are you guys doing! What are you guys doing! This is so strange, isn't it? Operation...X! What just happened! Great timing! Because of this, going to prison is no longer necessary. More like, we no longer have the stamina that we used to, but we can still run, right? We can run towards the future, right? You're late. Sorry. I'm glad you didn't end up in prison. Make sure you thank the girl named Misa What does she have to do with this? If you wanted to know... ask the lady herself. Tonight she leaves Japan by plane. Sheesh... Isn't he just going after her on impulse? Misa-san! Don't go! Didn't you promise? That you would become my bride. At that time I couldn't do anything but, But now... But now I will protect you! And make you happy! So... Thank you... You saved me again... One pain, one hope But I'm not alone... In my heart, Tasuku lives... The person you should protect, isn't me. It's a more wonderful person I'm sure. But you're... -But you're... -See ya. The rejected one. The rejected one. The rejected one! What are you doing here! This little boy is totally crying. You're even letting out strange sighs, that totally fits the situation. What! What? Huh? Got anything to say? Eat! Eat! Takumi, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle! Yes take a photo, take it take it! Right, ready...! Surely Someday! Hold on, one more time, one more, one more! OK! Cut! I'm sorry. Right cut! Cut cut. Ow! Cut! OK! Cut. OK! Right. Right OK! I'm very sorry. Pressed a strange place. Right cut. I forgot. Right, cut! OK! At Kitagawa Highschool some stu-stud... I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry... Cut. At Kitagawa highschool, some students have a bomb, and have ba-barricaded themselves in... I'm sorry, let's do it one more time. I'm truly sorry! I'm terrible, what's wrong with me today?

Yeah but, from her perspective, we are just common dust. You never know Afterall, with just his eyes... Shuuto came make 100% of the women swoon... Hey! Unbelievable... He's totally going...
