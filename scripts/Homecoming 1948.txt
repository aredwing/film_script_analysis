This is my 25th transport, More than 200,000 homecoming soldiers. Yeah. I'll bet you've gotten some wonderful yarns. Oh. I'll get one now and again. As a rule, though, a man who has a real story to tell Won't tell it, Not to a reporter anyhow. Well, how can you tell a man's got a story If he won't give out with it? Williams is psychic, didn't you know? Gets so you can see it in their faces. You can always pick out your man. You mean the man who isn't gonna give you a story. Yeah. There she is! Ha ha ha! Seems to me there are a lot Of interesting faces here. Haven't found your man yet, mr. Williams? Not yet. Nope. I'll see you later, kid. Light, colonel? Thank you. Great outfit, the 299th medical. We've heard a lot about it back here at home, colonel Johnson. Yes. Great outfit. Quite a job, fighting a war with only a hypodermic needle. Yes. What's your specialty, colonel? Specialty? Oh. I'm a surgeon. Had quite a practice back In '41, I expect, didn't you? Yes, quite a practice. That must seem like A long time a go, '41. A lot of water's gone Under the bridge since then. Yes. With that background And this war, You ought to have a whale Of a story to tell, colonel. I'm sorry, mr. Williams. No story. That makes it a bit rough on folks Back here at home, doesn't it? How so? I mean, well, they're The ones that have to live With the men Who are coming back. It seems only fair That they should know What the men Have been through, How they've changed. Perhaps. I'm afraid I have Nothing to say That would be Of any help. I don't know. I think people Can help each other a lot. Didn't you ever run in To someone Who gave you A new slant on things? Yes. Yes, I did. Maybe you have some Personal experience You could tell, colonel. What? No. I've had no personal Experiences, mr. Williams. I have nothing to say That would interest anyone. Ok, colonel. Sorry. Guess I'll be Getting along. Good luck, colonel. Thank you. Good luck to you. Maybe you Have some personal experience You could tell, colonel. No story. Had quite a practice back In '41, I expect, didn't you? Quite a practice. Must seem like A long time ago, '41. Yes. 1941 was a long time ago. How easy it all seemed At lafayette hospital, '41. Dr. Ulysses d. Johnson. I kind of thought of it As my hospital, And everybody else Seemed to think that way, too, And why not?

Well, I appreciate Your coming around, Bob, Especially after- Bob, I honestly always Meant to help you out Over there In chester village, But somehow, well, I Never got around to it. That's all right. No, it's not All right. It's been On my conscience. Well, maybe you'll feel like doing Something about it when you get back. You think the war's Gonna make a man of me? No. No. I think you'll take the War right in your stride, Lee. Like I do everything Else, you mean? I'm not trying To be nasty. You think I'm sort of a Callous person, don't you, Bob? No. Just busy. Very busy with a lot Of different things. Anyway, when you get back, chester Village will still be there. That's one thing you can Bank on unfortunately. What are you Going to do? What do you mean? Well, are you going To get into it? No. I thought about it, But then I decided I'd just stick around and do What I'm doing until they call me. Well, that's Too bad. Why? Well, I hoped you'd Get into it somehow, Get you out of that Rut you're in. Rut? I don't call Chester village a rut. I know, I know, I know. Fine work. After all, Not much future in it. For me, you mean? Of course, I mean For you. There comes a time In every man's life When he has to look Out for himself. I guess that is really Your philosophy, isn't it? It's anyone's philosophy Who's really honest. You can't solve all the Problems of the world. Why break your neck over Something you can't help? Anyway, you've done Your share, And now that we're In this war With really big Issues at stake- Look, Lee. Don't talk To me about issues. Your country's Been attacked. All right. Shut up! What? I want to tell you Something, Lee. I've been wanting to Tell you for a long time Ever since college. Go ahead. There's an awful lot of A four-flusher about you. You've got away With murder all your life, And when you have the guts to say That my country has been attacked, Implying that I'm not doing anything About it, that's pretty hard to take. Over there In chester village, Men have been Dying for years, Children are dying just For lack of decent care. Malaria, malnutrition, Hookworm. My country attacked? You're darn right It's been for a long time, But did you care? And don't kid yourself about That uniform you've got on. I'm glad you're in it. I'm very glad. It's the best thing You've ever done, But don't tell me You're in it Because of any issues At stake. You don't even know What the issues are. You're in it because it's The thing to do right now, Just because everybody Else is doing it. Get wise To yourself, Lee. Well, I guess that Washes us up nicely. It sure does. Bob, I didn't know You were here. Hello, penny. I just Dropped by for a moment. Just going. Well, come in And have a drink. I can't, really. Thanks just the same. Good-bye, Lee. Good luck. I know you'll do A good job. Thanks. And if anything should Come up while he's gone, You need anything, you Know where to find me. Thanks, Bob. I always had a sort of Soft spot for the johnsons. Go back to your guests. So long. Good luck. Lee, did you and Bob Have a quarrel? Well, you know Bob. Same old thing. I was terrible, dear. We Completely forgot to invite him. Was he hurt? I don't know. I- Sometimes, that guy Gets under my skin. I'm sorry, darling. Let's go back. Oh, uh, the carters Called to say They were sorry they couldn't Get over this afternoon. Oh? Told me to wish you Good luck for them. All right. Penny. Yes, dear? Have you ever thought I was a four-flusher? Four-flusher? What Are you talking about? Well, this afternoon, Bob said- Oh, Lee. I knew you and Bob had been at it again. He's a pretty smart guy. He seemed to think That I- I don't know. Lee, Bob's All right, And I'm Very fond of him, But he's not you. You're one of the finest Surgeons in this country, And if you want My opinion, One of the finest Men, too. Oh, darling, Stop it. This is our Last evening. Yes, and I'm sorry. You remember the first Time I ever kissed you? I remember. You were pretty fresh In those days. Heh. Oh, was I? I've always Liked this room. You're a born Homemaker, penny. I haven't talked Much about it, But don't think I don't Appreciate all you've given me. Thanks, darling. Keep everything Just the way it is Till I come back, Won't you? Don't have anything Changed. Not a thing. I promise. And, Lee, don't let Them change you either. Oh. Not a chance. You better turn in. You lock up. Yeah. I'll help you. Oh, Lee! Shh. Now, now. I'm sorry. How long do you think You'll be in carlisle? Oh. About 6 weeks Just for basic training. I hope it won't be Too hard on you. Oh! Nonsense. After all, I'm a doctor. It won't be anything. No further duties Tonight. Saturday, 1800 hours, fall In in front of the barracks In fatigues, leggings, and full Field packs for a night's travel. And off the record, I suggest You cancel all sunday appointments Because we'll be out For 36 hours at least. That's all, gentlemen. gone are my friends from the cotton fields away gone from this earth to a better land I know... Big ocean. Certainly is. Quiet crossing so far. Yes. Surprisingly so. Wonder where we're Headed for. Can't be africa. Might be. Oh. I think that show's About over, isn't it? Montgomery's got Rommel on the run. For the moment maybe. You never know. No. I think the african Campaign's in the bag. Probably won't be long before the Whole war's over now that we've come in. Wishful thinking. Hmm? I say, wishful thinking. Think so? Know it. That's how We got here. I wonder what My wife's doing now, This minute. Mine's just putting The kids to bed. You got any kids? No. Never felt The need for any. You don't know What you've missed. Really? How would You know? I have one, a boy. How old is he? Then why Are you here? Because I want him To be 12. Where's your husband? Somewhere in china. China? Yes. He's buried there. Oh. Sorry. It was 6 years ago. Anyway, he was fighting For what he believed in. Fighting in china? Was he chinese? No. He was An american pilot. 6 years ago? Yes. Then why- "swanee river" Yep. Takes you back. Why can't people Just stay at home And live their own lives, Enjoy the good things, Their work, Their home, music? Why must they always Be chasing around, Sticking their noses In other people's affairs. Comfortable philosophy, Major. Look, young lady. Would you mind terribly If I just sit quietly And talk to my friend here? Do I disturb you? Frankly, yes. That's what I mean, Everybody sticking Their noses Into other People's affairs, People butting into other People's conversations, American pilots Fighting in china. It's all the same. You can't understand that, Can you, major, Why an american should Be fighting in china? No, I can't. A man leaves His wife and child To go fight in a war that Wasn't any of our business? Wasn't it? Not 6 years ago. My husband hated Aggression even 6 years ago. Look, young lady. It's People like you that- Yes? That what? Never mind. No. Go on. People like me That what? Oh, drop it. When women Talk world politics, It makes me laugh. Do the women Of the bombed cities Of europe make you Laugh, major? Now what's that got To do with it? I'm talking about women who go around Thinking they have all the answers, Thinking that they even know The reasons we're in this war. I know some Of them, major. Because people didn't care What went on over there Until the murderers Got so far The whole world Was in danger. If we'd had a little simple Humanity at the very start, All this might Have been stopped. Oh. That means me, I suppose. Well, you're quite a specimen, Major, as far as I can see. Look, young lady. I'll tell you The reason I think People like you Are in this war. I think They enjoy it. It's a new sensation For them. If I were you, I'd leave The glory to the others And run along home and, Well, take care of my child. My child is well Taken care of, major. May I? Thanks. And thanks a lot For the lecture. Oh, not at all. Never Too late to learn, major. Of all the fresh- Who is she? Snapshot, They call her. Her name's, um, Mccall. Yes, that's it- Lieutenant mccall. Whose nurse is she?

Where is he? Number 6. What's wrong With him? Ruptured spleen. How did that happen? Malaria. Malaria? Is he pretty bad? Yes. There's nothing We can do. Some friends to see You, sergeant. Hello, monk. Hello, doc. Nurse mccall. Hello, monk. So we've got You again, huh? This time For keeps, doc. You sure there's No more to be done? Not only The acute condition. The poor lad's full Of hookworm. It's bled him white, Anemic, No resistance. Doc. Yes, monk. Lean over further. I'm right here, Monk. Remember... Remember what You promised, doc. Give... Give the old man A kiss for me. I will. 29 verrick street, Chester village. I won't forget. Sure. Sure. Thanks for Everything, doc. It's all over. Match? Of course, that kid Should never have been In the army In the first place. His spleen would never Had ruptured If he hadn't Had malaria. He had that Before he enlisted. It wasn't on his records. He lied about it. Told me he'd had it For years. Of course, if he'd had Medical attention earlier, This probably never Would have happened. Well... Malaria. Huh. Doesn't that Make you mad? An american soldier Dies on the battlefield- Killed, but not By the enemy. What's the matter With us, anyway? I always thought we were the Kindest people in the world, And yet here we are, allowing Things like this to happen. Oh, I know a lot's Being done at home, But it's not enough. It's never enough. I can just imagine What kind of a hole This kid had to live in Back home. But weren't there Any doctors around Who knew What was going on? Why didn't they Do something about it? Not enough of them cared, That's why. And that's Our whole trouble. We just don't Care enough. You're wrong. The town Monk lived in Had plenty of Doctors who cared, But I wasn't One of them. Oh, I'd forgot. He came From your hometown. Colonel Johnson? He's not here, snapshot. Oh. Thank you. Come in. Um, you don't know Where he is? No, I-I haven't Seen him for some time. Well, it doesn't Matter. I only thought- What? What's wrong, snapshot? Nothing. It was Something I said. I'm afraid I upset him very much. Yes, you seem to have A... Faculty for doing that. Why do I always Shoot off my mouth? Will I ever learn? He isn't- He isn't heartless, You know. Neither are you, Snapshot. What? You've got a heart, too. Don't let it Get you into trouble. I'm not a child, Sir. I know you're not. That's the point. The kind of trouble I mean, Children don't get into. Too late, colonel... But thanks. Look what I found growing In a crater-lupine. Well, What do you know? Back home in california, The fields were full of Them this time of year. Ha ha! Say, snapshot... Has Johnson Been in yet? I... I haven't Seen him this morning. I don't think we'll have To operate on this boy. We'll send him To the base. I didn't know You had started, Or I would have Come straight in. It's quite all right. Uh, could I get you A cup of coffee? No, thanks. Coming pretty close. Yes. Take cover! Take cover! Better get down there Until it lets up. All right, Step on it! Take cover! Take cover! Sounds as if They meant business. We may have some work On our hands. Yes. He used to Deliver our laundry. He lived in a slum back Home called chester village. I fixed his leg For him. He was just Another case. That's the way it's been With all my patients- Just cases... Not human beings. You were right, Snapshot. I've never cared Enough. Oh, useless. Don't. I'm sorry For what I- It's not that. Don't let it worry you. There was a man Back home who cared. Dr. Sunday. He knew What it was all about. He got something. My father had it, too, And my grandfather. Silver's got it. You've got it, too, Snapshot. I'll never forget That boy As long as I live. You're a swell guy, Useless... A swell guy. I know. I know exactly. I'm very fond Of you, useless. I'd like you To hold me close. I'd like it very much. But you belong To someone else. And... That hit something. Colonel Johnson! Colonel silver's Still in there! Hit the dirt! Lie still. Don't try to get up. Bed number 3- Desmond. He's safe. Get me one ampule Of c.s.b. Miller, bradford. They're all safe. Are you in pain? No. No pain at all. Come in. I'll be out In a moment. Bob! Hello, penny. What are you Doing here? Lee wrote me. He wanted me to come And see mr. Monkevickz. Oh. Well... Just a moment. He's very ill, Penny. I told him You were here, And he's Very grateful, But I think It'll be better If you don't See him now. Oh, I'm sorry. How have you been, Penny? Fine, Bob. Thanks. Where is Lee now? England, for the last 3 months or so. I'm sorry I haven't Been over to see you. Always wanted to, but I've been very busy. I guess everybody is These days. Penny... You look A little pale. Is anything wrong? No. I'm all right. Why don't you come home With me for a cup of tea? All right, Bob. I'd like to. Fine. You, uh, May very easily Be exaggerating Everything, you know, penny? No. No, Bob, I'm losing him. I know it. Every day, He's getting Further away From me. He's changing. I can feel him changing. Perhaps he's changing For the better. Yes. I have no doubt, But what difference Does that make? I'm losing him. He can change All he wants to, And I'll Still love him, But he may not Love me. Penny - oh, I can read between the lines. He says When he comes back We ought to have a Different life together. He thinks we were Smug and selfish. Just being in love with Each other wasn't enough. Penny. Yes? Who is she? They call her "snapshot." She's his nurse. Is he in love With her? Worse. He's gotten over it. Oh, I wrote him About it, A whole year ago. I told him he was In love with her, And he laughed At me. Look, penny- And then today, another letter comes, A whole year later. He... Said he'd been Thinking it over carefully. He wanted it all clear between us. It seems There was a time When There was danger, But he resisted. It took him a whole Year to think it over, But he resisted, And now they're- They're just pals. Oh, Bob, I hate pals. At least He's honest about it. I know he's honest. At least He thinks so. I know Lee so well. He's-he's so boyish In some ways, Always has been. I've always known That Lee was- Well, we both were- Well, Never either of us Felt a great deal About other people, Just about Each other, And if Lee Is becoming more- Well, more Understanding, Wiser, More sympathetic- Whatever it is, I'm glad, But if he's Going to change, Why can't we do it Together? I know how lonely He's been. Lee never Made friends easily, Never let anyone Inside much. That's what Frightens me. If this- This snapshot Has really filled the Loneliness for him, She must be something rather good. I know she is, Or Lee wouldn't Be interested. It must be something Quite deep, So deep he wouldn't even see it himself Until it was Too late. Oh, Bob, I'm not inhuman. I know how much we all Need someone to lean on, To talk to; How much we need Warmth and- And sympathy... And love. Well... Maybe the johnsons Have a problem at last, But they'll Work it out. I'm frightened, Bob, So awfully, Awfully frightened. And she calls him "useless." Isn't that revolting? Dr. Sunday, look. Hello, colonel. Afternoon, colonel. Oh, colonel Johnson. Yes, captain? I was looking For you. I wondered when you'd Like to see the new nurse. Why, anytime. Tomorrow will do. I'll see her before I go on My leave. There's no hurry. When is miss mccall Leaving? Anytime now. She had some reports To finish. Rather rough Losing her. She's been with you A long time, Hasn't she? Yes, she has. We're all gonna miss her a great deal. Yes. Well, I'll send The new nurse To see you In the morning then. Good-bye, colonel. Good-bye, captain. Um... Yes? What is it? Well, I-I hear you're going On leave pretty soon, sir, To paris. That's right. I suppose Quite a lot of the guys Have asked you to Buy stuff for them. No, not too many. Why? Well, I - I was sort of wondering If you'd get my girl Something from paris. Your girl? Yes, sir. Sure, mac. I'd be glad to Get her something. What do you want? Oh, I guess it Really doesn't matter, Just as long as It's from paris. I wrote down a few things here that I- That I thought She might like. Ok, mac. I'll try to get her Something nice. Oh, thanks A million, sir. Good-bye. Yes? May I come in? Please do. Well, this is it, Useless. All ready to go? Yes, but I've got A few minutes. Still don't know where You'll be stationed, Of course? No. No. I'll be Reassigned From casual nurses' pool Headquarters- England, Back to the states, The pacific, maybe. Snapshot... If after you know, I'd appreciate it If you let me know. I'd... Well, I'd sort Of like to think of you In some Particular place. There's so many places You could be sent. I'd like to know where. I'll let you know, Useless. I did everything I could To keep you. I know. Selfish of me. I'm sure they want you For something important. You know I'd rather Stay with this outfit. Well, it's- It's like home to me. It can't be helped. Nope. It can't be helped. Well, I got to Catch the convoy. Yes. Snapshot... I'm going to be lost Without you. Good-bye, useless. It's been swell. Snapshot. Would you like A table, sir? No. No, thank you. Oh, colonel? Right. Where's the bar, Please? The room right Over there, monsieur. Thank you. Well, we made it. Hello, useless. I thought you were at the Other end of the world by now. No. Right here in paris All this time. They haven't Reassigned me yet, So I'm on sort of a leave For a week until they do. Why didn't you Let me know? I would have Let you know later. After you'd gone, You mean. Yes, after I'd gone. Snapshot, We've got a table Right by The first window. I'll be right in. It's a farewell party. Two of the girls are going Back to the states tomorrow. Judith o'neill is Going to look up my son. Where will I- When will I see you? Where will you be? In the bar. Right after dinner. I'll be waiting. It never occurred To either of us That we'd ever Get married. We'd known Each other so long, All our lives. We were kids Together. All through Grade school, Then high school, And when I studied Nursing, He was going to college In the same town. But... Then we did Get married. We had a wonderful Two years. I learned a lot Of things from him. He was so honest And cared so much. Ever since I can remember, He was always Sort of... Fighting for The right things. He sounds ok. He was. They sent me his things From nanking. This lighter Was among them. That's why I've never Thrown it away. It's a broken torch, But... It still strikes fire. It's... Well, It's like him somehow. So there you have the Story of my life complete, Up to a certain day About... Well, about 21/2 years ago. What happened 21/2 years ago? Well, we were at sea, About 6 days out. It was just about dusk. It was a lovely Evening-calm and still. A lot of soldiers and Nurses lying around the deck. We were all Being shipped somewhere. I was feeling Very peaceful when- When all of a sudden, Someone made a remark That made me furious, And I answered, And two minutes later, I found myself Involved in an argument. It lasted for... Snapshot. Dance with me, useless. Yes, sir, we are Paging colonel Johnson. Hold the line, please. Thanks. Yes. Speaking. Who? Oh, hello, george. When did you get here? Because I thought You were going to- What? What? Well, I can't believe it. Are you sure? Good heavens. Well, how'd you get through? I see. Well, yes. Yes, of course. Thanks for calling me, george. Good-bye. Anything wrong? Let's finish this First. Here's to all the nurses Of the 299th. And all the doctors, Too. And all our friends, As well, The ones we'll see again And the ones we won't. Well, what is it? What's happened? Germans Have broken through. They're on the march again With all they've got. It's their order Of the day- Paris by christmas. Our whole front Is collapsing. They've surrounded Bastogne. Bastogne? Check, please. Well, what are you Going to do? Get back to the outfit If I can. Well, let's go. What? You're not going. Who says I'm not? But you're stationed- Look. I'm on A week's leave, And if they can Use a doctor, They can use A nurse, too, If only for a week, And if you Don't take me, I'll find some other Way to get there. Let's go. 299th evacuation! 299th evacuation! 299th evacuation! Saw them last About 4 miles away- What was left of them. What is it? Wait a minute. Tank. Out! Quick! They gone? Yeah. What do we do, Get started? Suicide to be on these roads tonight. Not even a chance to Get through to basecles. Not a prayer. How about getting back To cologne? Too risky. Better stay put right Here until daylight. It's hours till daylight. Yes. Better try and get Some rest while you can. You're Tired and cold. I'm sorry, useless. We don't dare Build a fire. No, no, no. I'm all right. Try and get A little rest. Sure. You, too. I'll watch A while yet. Insane of me to Let you come along. But you didn't let me. I could have Stopped you. You were Out of this mess. You were free. You were going away. Is my life worth any more Than any of the others? It is to me. You see, I love you, snapshot. Oh, useless. Oh, useless. Oh, my darling. Darling, darling. Hello, colonel. Taking a look At the skyline? It's got "home" Written all over it. Cigarette? It certainly Looks good. Got a match? Oh. It's all right. I'll get it. Thank you.

Here are the checks For my baggage. Yes, sir. The car's right out in front. Well, uh, Shall we go? Remember this house? I ought to. I was hoping you'd come in the daytime. I planted geraniums All along the border. They're so pretty. Well, you can see them In the morning. Clean. So clean, penny. Hello, Lee. Hello, mother. Ahh. So we've Got you again. Ohh. This is a big moment for us, Lee. Me, too. You're not A wrinkle older. Oh, yes, yes. How do you think Penny looks? Beautiful. I just wanted to get A glimpse of you. Now I'll go. Good night, Lee. It means everything To have you home. Now we can all Sort of begin to... Live again. Good night, Penny, dear. Good night, mother. She's been here All afternoon. She was afraid She might be in the way, But I made her stay. I'm glad you did. She's really Missed you, Lee. Yes. Oh, Sol. Where's Sarah? Oh, she's a little bashful, sir. She must be In the kitchen. I'll go and see her. Good old Sarah. Hasn't changed A bit. No. It's a beautiful House. Yes, isn't it? I love it. Are you hungry? Would you- Would you like Something to eat? No, thanks. I had dinner On the plane. How was the trip? Very smooth. I want to go down to the Hospital in the morning, Look around, See what it's like. Might be difficult at first To pick up the loose ends. Yes. I don't know quite What you want to do. A lot of people Have called. You don't want to see Anyone just yet, do you? I guess I don't quite feel like Seeing people at the moment. I understand, Lee. Thanks. You must be Awfully tired, Lee. Yes, I am. I guess we'd better Turn in. You go on upstairs, And I'll lock up. I guess I am tired. Don't be so sure he Doesn't love you, penny. Lee doesn't know exactly what He wants himself yet, you know. You've seen him? Yes. He was here This morning. Oh. He said he didn't Want to see anyone yet. He wanted to apologize. I thought at first He meant that he was sorry For an argument We had before he left. I said, "forget it. I have." But that wasn't it. He said, "no, Bob, "I just want to apologize To you in general. I've got to trust you To understand what I mean." And then as he was going, He said something that Touched me very deeply. He looked at me And said, "how on earth Did I miss What you've been telling Me all these years?" I watched him From this window. He went across To monkevickz's house And went in. I don't know How long he was there. I watched For quite a while. You know, penny, I've known Lee For a long time. Lots of times, we didn't see eye to eye, Yet I've always Loved him. Now I sort of Know why. He's quite a guy, Penny. He's worth fighting for. Face him. Ask him about snapshot, What his plans are. Oh, hello. Please don't get up. Have you Been home long? No, Just a few minutes. I stayed At the hospital Longer Than I intended. I'm sorry I'm late. I- I went out For a while. Did they give you A rousing welcome? Yes. But it seemed strange. Yes. You're very understanding, penny. The garden is lovely, Isn't it? Yes. I've sat out here a lot Waiting for you. Yes. I thought of you sitting out here. Would you like A bacardi? I don't know whether You still like them. Well, neither do I, But I'm sure I would. But let's just stay Here a minute, penny. Penny, there's something I'd like to say. When I left, we promised each other We wouldn't change. Remember? I remember. Well, I'm afraid I didn't Stick to our bargain. I somehow feel different about things. I've lost some of the Assurance I used to have. I - I'm not quite so sure of things anymore. And yet, In another way, I feel surer Than I... I'm afraid I can't explain. Lee, you don't have To explain... Anything. Can I get something, Lee? No. No thanks. I just want A cigarette. Does it- Does it bother you much? Your-your leg? No. It's all right. Lee... Lieutenant mccall- Has she come home, Too? Lieutenant mccall died In a hospital in belgium Several weeks ago. Oh. I saw her in the hospital A few days before. You want to tell me About it? Yes. Yes, I'd like to Very much, penny. Of course. She was wounded just Outside cologne- Shell fragment. I went on further Into germany. That's Where I got this. Then, After v.e. Day, When I was On my way home, I heard that She was in lier. I got there At a bad time. She had just had Another operation, And the doctor was Very discouraged. I talked to him. He said he felt her Chances were very slight. In fact, He was quite sure That it was Hopeless. I couldn't Believe it. I'd seen A lot of people die, But somehow Snapshot- She was so active And alive, You somehow felt there was Something indestructible About her. I was stunned. Finally, they told me That I could see her, But only for a few minutes. I don't think I was ever So shocked in my life. I'd been through Almost 3 years of war with her. She'd stood up under everything That even men couldn't take. Then, to see her The way she was that day... Leaves you with something you... Can't ever forget. Hello, useless. This is a fine place To find you. What's the idea? Just getting A little rest. So, you're going home At last, useless. Hmm. Yep. Good. You will be, too, Soon. Sure. How are you coming, Anyway? Mm. How can I tell? You know you can never Believe these doctors. Thanks for the letters, Useless. They were swell letters. Oh, yes. I nearly forgot. There on the table. I don't... Smoke anymore. I thought You might like it. It's an old trick I used to pull. They want you to go. You're wearing The patient out. You-you will Write me, won't you? Lafayette hospital. Promise me. Maybe. And-and when You come back... Mm. You know the saying In the army, useless. When a soldier Leaves his outfit, All debts and friendships Are canceled. No, snapshot. No. Mm-hmm. It's a good saying. When you're home, You'll know it. "I'm wounded, But I'm not slain." "I'll but lie down And bleed a while"... "and then I'll rise And fight again." Good-bye, useless. Don't miss your convoy. Snapshot. Snapshot. Go home, useless. Go home. It seemed as if There must be something That I could do... But there wasn't. Everything had been done That could be. Several days later, I phoned The hospital from cherbourg. They told me She was dead. I stopped to see her Little boy on the way home. He lives with His grandparents. Nice little boy. Very much like her. It might have been Easier If I hadn't told you, And yet... That would have been Impossible. I couldn't think of Anything else coming home. And then, on the boat, I met a man, A perfect stranger Who couldn't possibly Have known What was in my mind, Yet somehow, he seemed to Confirm my innermost thoughts. He said, It's only fair For the people Over here to know That they've got to Live with us coming home. He was right. I had to tell you... Because it isn't Just my problem; It's our problem Together. And I couldn't Go on living With this Inside of me Without your sharing it. Penny, bear with me A while, can you? Oh, Lee. I'm sorry. My heart's so full. I... I wonder if anyone could Ever know what it means To be the one who's- Who's left out, The one who's spared. In all the time I've waited for you, When I tried to follow every Movement of yours on my map, And read and reread Your letters, In all These 3 long years, The worst of it was, I couldn't help you. I couldn't Do anything for you. But, Lee, the thing that gave me More courage than anything else Was that somehow, The hope that When you came back, You might need me. And now-now you do Need me, Lee. I'm in it again. Oh, Lee, I'm so glad You told me what you did, Let me inside again, Made me a part of it. You asked me if I can bear with you for a while. Oh, darling... I can bear with you for as long as our lives last. I love you, Lee. What, darling? I said, "welcome home." At long last, welcome home. Dinner's served, mrs. Johnson.
