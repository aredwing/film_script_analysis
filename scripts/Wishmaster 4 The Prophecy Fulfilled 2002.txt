You want something to drink? juice, mineral water? - Water would be great. - Water it is. I'm starting to think this case is never going to get settled. Sam is so frustrated. You'd think a company this size Would admit their fault and do the honorable thing. Well, honor's for battlefields. Well, if this isn't turning into one I don't know what is. Ta-da! - What's this? - It's a gift. For your patience and faith. Steven, I know how hard you're working, you don't need to-- I found it on one of my all night web surfing jags. It's nothing. I know how much you like that sort of thing. It's very thoughtful. Thank you. Wow, I'm sorry. If bad timing were fatal I'd be road-kill. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay. I should be more sensitive to your situation. It's not your fault. It's not like I haven't thought about it. - Really? - Yeah. You've been really sweet through this whole thing, Above and beyond the call of duty. That's me, nice guy Steven. The kind of lawyer you want to introduce to your homely friend. - That's not what I meant. - I know what you meant. Look, Sam's accident was a horrible thing. And the complications surrounding your case are a nightmare. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. I've known Sam for a long time. But I see the way he treats you now. You've said it yourself. You and Sam are at a crossroads. All I want is a chance To position myself as an option. I gotta get back to the store. Yeah. It's broken. Oh no. Wow, did that come out of the box? - What's the matter? - I don't want it. No problem. um... Tell you what, I'll get this appraised. We can keep it here until I find out what it's worth. That will be great. I'd appreciate it. You're not leaving, are you? Yeah, I have to go. Hey, Lisa... Is everything okay between us? Yeah, it's fine. Really. Okay. - 'bye. - I got it. 'bye. Good one, Steve. Real smooth. Sam, I'm home. - Are you hungry? - Nope. You have to have something for dinner. I did. I thought that was breakfast. Very good. So, you and Verdel figure out how to make me a rich man yet? Not yet. He does have a plan, doesn't he? I mean, that's why you were over there today. He's working hard on our case without any compensation. oh, I'm sure he's getting compensated. What do you mean by that? He's a lawyer, isn't he? Are you implying that I slept with him? Is that what this is about? Sex? It's always about sex. Sex is not that important. Sam! It is to me! And it was to you before-- Our relationship has always been based on love and trust. Love and trust are only words if you can't back them up. How can you love me when I can't love you? I don't care about-- If you want to be alone you can always go upstairs. God damn it. - Not quite. - What the hell? That's closer. Who are you? How did you get in here? I'm here to offer you a deal. Is that right? A deal? Who sent you? Hollister? Is this some sort of a scare tactic to get me into a settlement? If I wanted to scare you, you would be scared. Are you? You tell Hollister I don't care how powerful he thinks he is, We're not going to back down. I suggest you climb back out the window before I call the cops. - You wish me to leave? - No. No. Not until you meet our city's finest. I can grant you anything you desire. Anything you can imagine. That sounds to me like an offer to settle. It is. Your soul for a wish. I wish you would stop talking in riddles And tell me exactly what it is you want. As you wish. I want three wishes from the waker. To free my race from their eternal bondage. And now that I've granted your wish, I will take my soul. Your identity will offer me easy access to the waker. Nice. Hello, Lisa. I was hoping we could spend a little time together. Sam. So much for the trip down memory lane. Good morning, Sam. It's a little early to be chasing ambulances. The early bird gets the worm, Sam. This morning we're going for the whole garden. Am I interrupting something here? Not at all. Can I get you some coffee? No. I would like to take you both out to breakfast To discuss my new strategy for your case. - A new strategy? - Something Lisa said yesterday inspired me. Yeah, Lisa's full of inspiration. You should see her in the morning. I have interrupted, I'm sorry. we can go over this another time. Don't be ridiculous, Verdel. Get what you came for. You two don't need me. just tell me where to sign. At least I can still do that. Well... As your attorney, I would advise you to pass On the scintillating breakfast invitation, And take this to a more neutral territory, My office? Yeah. Give me a couple minutes. Take your time. I wish you'd join us, Sam. That's not much of a wish. I suppose it's not. I'm certain you could do better, right? Not me. I'm all wished out. Come on, Sam. You must have one wish left inside you somewhere. I used my last one right before the doorbell rang. Really? How did it turn out? I think we both know the answer to that, don't we? Ready. Are you sure you won't come with us, Sam? Fine. I'm not kidding. It's the truth. Caligula was the most misunderstood man in rome. Caligula was a monster. Don't believe everything you read. He was a passionate man with a taste for beauty and extravagance. - You sound like you knew him. - Maybe I did-- In another life. What? What is it? - What's different about you? - I told you. I was inspired last night to become the man you see before you. You told me you were inspired into a new strategy. Which, by the way, we have yet to talk about. Ah yes, The strategy. - So? - I'm waiting for you. Waiting for me to what? Tell me what you wish for and the strategy begins. Steven, don't tell me this was just a game To get me alone with you. Play the game, Lisa, then judge me. Come on, make a wish. All right. I wish you could make them settle this case. That wasn't so hard, was it? Will you tell me your plan? Shh, listen. - Yeah. - Doug Hollister, Steven Verdel. How did you get this number? Did you have a chance to go over our new proposal? What kind of game are you playing, Verdel? You're about to find out, Doug. Do those numbers fall in place for you? Are you out of your fucking mind? $10 million? What are you, the hero of some John Grisham novel? Who the hell do you think you're dealing with? You call this number again and you'll be writing briefs for what's left of your pitiful, insignificant career! Don't hang up, Doug. I'm certain we can settle this right now. What the hell is going on? I suggest you hold your tongue until we're finished. Thank you, Doug, that's very kind of you. We both know you can cut off your nose to spite your face, But that's not going to change the testimony of my star witness. I think you know-- The designer of the braking system That failed on my client's bike. The one that's cashing the payoff checks to keep him quiet. Mr. Hollister? You get the point, Doug, huh? Graft just doesn't inspire the same loyalty these days, does it, Doug? I'll tell you what, sign the agreement, fax it over to my office and we'll end this painful exchange? I know that you're racked with pain over this, but I'm not the one holding a gun to your head, am I? You know me, Doug, I love a good story. Shoot. Okay... yeah. It's been fun, Doug. All right. You see? He was dying to get it done. Am I supposed to believe someone was actually on the other end? Have a look. I love my job. - I can't believe it. - Oh, believe it. I've also decided not to take a fee. Steven? It is not about money for me, Lisa. - I can't let you do that. - It's done. Go home and share the good news with Sam. Enjoy it. What happened to you last night? You might say I was reborn. Thank you. - Sam! - Yeah? You are not going to believe this! He did it! Steven did it! Sounds like breakfast went well. $10 million! They settled And faxed the agreement right to his office. Sam, can you believe this? Great. Now we can start arguing about how to split it. He not taking anything. he's not taking a fee. I was talking about us. - This is good news. - It is. It's your last hurdle on your path to freedom. I understand why you're so excited. You think I've stayed to get a piece of this settlement? It's the best reason I can come up with. Why are you doing this, Sam? Why are you doing this to me? Hello. It's for you. Hello. Have you two booked your trip around the world yet? Not yet. I was hoping I could take you both to dinner tonight to celebrate. I don't think so, Steven. Come on. This case has been hard on everyone. Let me share your good fortune for one night. I don't think Sam's up to it. Put him on then. That's the least he can do for $10 million. - What time? - 8:00, the palace. Okay. A few loose ends to tie up? He wants to take us to dinner to celebrate. I assume you don't want to go. I wouldn't want to be a third wheel. Or a fourth, fifth, six and seventh for that matter. Enjoy your dinner. Thank you. Wow! You look fantastic. - Thank you. - Please. Where's Sam? He didn't feel up to coming. I took the liberty of ordering wine. I hope you don't mind. So, a toast-- To your new life. To your amazing work and incredible generosity. You keep that up and you'll have me drunk in no time. So, what's with Sam? why wasn't he up to it? Was he disappointed with the settlement? No, it's not about the money. There's enough to pay the medical bills and his therapy, with a fortune left over. He just... He pushes me away every chance he gets. It's like I'm a part of his injury. He doesn't know how to communicate-- Is there something else I can do? You're not a psychiatrist too, are you? I can be anything you want me to be. The spoken word is a powerful thing. Don't be afraid to tell me what's on your mind. I just wish Sam could walk again. Yeah. I understand. Here we go. That looks terrific. Thank you. Well, dig in. Can I take these for you? Yeah, please. I wish someone would kiss me like that. - They will. - I won't hold my breath. Lisa, you forgot your dessert. Sam... - How was dinner? - It was great. Normally I'd say I wish you were there, but, that would be a lie. Obviously you've been busy here with something more important. If you need anything... Call me. We need to get you to a doctor. It's not your problem anymore. If not mine, then whose? I've been here through it all. and like it or not, Whatever this miracle is, I'm a part of it. just because I was out for dinner with Steven-- This is about my legs, nothing else. That's why you need to see a doctor. Let me rephrase this for you. All I feel is pain. And the only place I have feeling is in my legs. It means he's walking. None of the doctors can explain it. The x-rays still show the damage, he's in pain, But he's walking. I've got to do his chart. I'll bet anything mercury went retrograde And passed through his fourth house. What? I'll explain it later. What about his mojo? is that rising? - What are you talking about? - Sex. Have you guys done it yet? It'll come. I'll work up his chart And give you an e.t.e.-- Estimated time of erection." I don't know. Do you think this makes me look too fat? Only in the right places, right? - Yeah. - Really? Can I help you with something? Yes, I believe you can. Steven, what are you doing here? This is nice, Lisa. with your new windfall, You guys could expand and franchise. Yeah, we like the intimacy. It makes it a lot easier for women to shop. Especially for underwear. I don't remember underwear looking like this. Great choice, wrong size. I'd say you're more of a 16. Course, I couldn't be sure until I saw it on you. Would you like a dressing room? Only if you have the shoes to match. This is my partner Tracy. Tracy this is Steven Verdel our lawyer. And friend. Nice to meet you, Tracy. So you're the man responsible for the resurrection? No, he's the man responsible for the settlement. Whatever. Destiny has a way of tying things together. I couldn't agree more. In fact, that's why I'm here. I was hoping when you got off work You'd come by my place, we could talk about it? Our destiny? I think the last 24 hours have been rather miraculous, Wouldn't you say? And I was thinking that-- well... I was hoping that it had something to do with you and me. Come on, it will be just talking. I'll make you a real mean cup of coffee. Okay, but I have to check on Sam first. Okay then. Tonight? - Yeah. - Great. - It was nice meeting you. - You, too. You'd better be careful, Lisa. An aura that strong is capable of anything. You going somewhere? Get a beer. You don't want one, do you? Since when do you need a haircut to get a beer? since I started walking. Sam, we need to talk about us. Are you sure you don't want Verdel here? He's a good lawyer, isn't he? I understood your anger before. I mean, look at you, you can walk. I don't understand why we can't be-- What? Pretend like it never happened? pretend like I didn't see the way you looked at me When you bathed me, dressed me and wheeled me down the street? That is not true. I always loved you. You pitied me. No, you pitied you. I didn't fall in love with your legs, Sam. All I ever wanted was for us to love each other Like we did before. It's not like it was before. I know. And you remind me every chance you get. Look, we're not married. The settlement's half yours. why don't we get it over with And let me pretend to enjoy whatever time I have left? What are you talking about? Sex, Lisa. I'm talking about sex. How's it been for you lately? 'cause for me it's been-- Where are you going? The only place where I won't be looked at like a patient. And it only costs me a dollar a dance. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you believe that prayers can be answered? Well, I don't know about that, But I do believe that we can make our wishes reality. What's the difference between a wish and a prayer? A prayer is an exercise in faith, But a wish is a confirmation of desire. When you desire something strong enough, You manifest it as tangible. All right-- You wished for this lawsuit to be settled, and it was. You wished for Sam to walk again, And he did. Had you wished for the past, Sam might not be where he is tonight. But you didn't. I think that the future holds your destiny-- Not the past. What do you wish for? To be the kind of man you want me to be. I think the wine went straight to my head. I'm going to get some water. No, no, no. Stay. Let me get it. I wish I could just love you for who you really are. Another wish. What? What's the matter, Steven? I want you to leave. Please. Okay. Steve, are you all right? I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling very well. It's okay. I understand. Why do you delay? Fulfill the prophecy. Grant the third wish. The third wish has been made. You must grant it And free your brothers. Tell me how I shall grant the third wish, That she love me for who I truly am? Human love is a weakness. Take her. Human love must be given freely, or it isn't love. It's a trap, A wish only she can grant. Be warned, the hunter has been awakened. Fulfill the prophecy before he stops her. If he kills the waker-- I shall slay the hunter with his own sword. No one shall harm the waker. Go away! - Hello, Tracy. - Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. I was hoping we could talk about Lisa. Don't tell me she stood you up? No. No. In fact, we had a rather nice evening. I've never had to deal with these feelings before. And... I'm sorry, I shouldn't bother you with this. It's okay. It's what I do. Come on. I'm not certain what I have to offer Would be appealing to a woman like Lisa. You can offer love, can't you? I love what I do. Unfortunately, what I do doesn't Allow me much time for love. Spoken like a true heartbreaker. I don't want to break her heart-- I want to win it. I was hoping you could give me some insight on how to do that. I'm loaded with insight. Shoot. Suppose I had some dark secret I didn't want Lisa to know But I needed to tell her, you know? Do you think she could still love me? Depends on the secret. - You're not married, are you? - No, I'm not married. How dark can it be? I guess it depends on who you ask. The key to sharing dark secrets is all in the timing. You have to pick your moments. I'd start with wine and roses. And then? Do I have to spell it out for you? It's obvious to me where you want this relationship to go. Remember, we're dealing with a woman Who hasn't made love in three years. Three years? It seems like an eternity since I've romanced a woman. It's not as complicated as people make it out to be. It's all about her. All you need to do Is fulfill her every wish and desire, And then any revelations Will seem all the easier to take. If you were Lisa, what would you wish for? After what she's been through? If I was Lisa, I'd wish for some killer sex. Killer sex? Killer sex, Steve. Pushing it past your comfort zone. That sounds like you're talking about pain. Whatever-- pleasure, pain. It all goes through the Same nerve center anyway, right? Seems like you know what you're talking about. Not with the men I've been dating. I wish I was having some killer sex. Granted. Careful what you wish for, my dear. Let go! Let me go! It's just you. Is that disappointment or fear? No. I was having a nightmare. We were making love and the weirdest thing happened. Yeah, I've had that nightmare a lot lately. The past. No, I didn't mean it that way. Hello? Is there any way I can bring Tracy up on murder charges? 'cause she's killing me. What's going on? I've been calling her for over an hour. She won't answer. Inventory's not finished and the order has to be in by noon. I'll be in as soon as I can, okay? How you doing, pal? What can I get you? Your best brandy. Is that choice, or what? What do you suppose would make a woman like that fall in love? A fat wallet. - And a fatter dick. - Money and sex? That's what makes the world go round, my friend. I mean, look at her. What else would a piece like that need? A B.A. in marketing? She's got her pick of every guy in this place. And she knows it. Then why doesn't she just choose? She does... every night. Relax, it's early. You wanna be a player, just step up to the table. - Do you find her desirable? - Desirable? I'd sell my soul just to be a pimple on her ass. Really? Enjoy the view... brother. Nick? Nick? I don't know how you put up with her. Believe me, it's mutual. Did you bring the inventory sheets? Oh, no. What I'd tell you? Good morning. My name's Jennifer. And who's the lucky girl we're shopping for today? Or boy. Excuse me. Excuse me. Where do you think you're going? Don't make me use this on such a pretty face. Get the hell out of here before I call the cops. Don't say I didn't warn you. Where is the waker? Excuse me? She's awakened the djinn. She's made the third wish that will bring upon armageddon. oh, I see. Let's see if I can... Get someone over here to help find that... waker. Yes, you may. There's a tall, attractive man, robbing my store at this very moment. Shit. Looking for clients? You might say that. Why did you want to meet here, Verdel? Is this where you brought Lisa for dinner? I don't think she would appreciate the amenities this establishment has to offer. What do you think of her, Sammy? 'cause she's the fantasy of every man in this club. And you can have her if you want her. What are you talking about? Granting you a wish. How many nights did you sit in your wheelchair And wish you could take a woman like her home? Would you like to have sex again, Sam? The kind of sex you remember? The kind of sex you can only dream about? Because I can make that happen for you. Wish for her and she's yours. Anyway... anywhere. You can get her for me? If that's what you wish. Then I don't want her. 'cause anything you touch, I want no part of. Does that include Lisa? That's right. I touched her, too. I got to tell you, I like the way she feels. You probably don't remember that, do you, Sam? shall I remind you? I don't think Lisa would mind. I got a little secret for you-- It takes more than two good legs to satisfy a woman like Lisa. Don't you want to hit me, Sam? Yeah, I think you do. I'll bet you wish you could kick the shit out of me right here. Come on, say it. on my terms, Verdel. Not yours. That is a good way to lose your hand, my friend. Come on, you know the rules. Maybe it's time to change them. Change them? Did you hear this guy? Pretty funny. Why don't you find a seat and enjoy the show? And the next drink's on me. - Is that right? - Yeah. It seems to me this drink's on you. I've been waiting a long time for one of you big spenders to come in and step over that line. Let's see what you got, tough guy. Is that what you wish me to do? Is that what I wish you to do? What are you, some kind of fag? is that it? Want me to smack you around so you can get off? I want to give you what you want. Get the fuck out of here. Is that your wish? Is that your wish, you sick fuck? I'm just here to serve you. fuck off! You know what I'd wish? I'd wish you'd put up a better fight. Granted. What the fuck? Let's see what you got, tough guy. That is a good way to lose your hand, my friend. This is a better way. Now, is it mondays and wednesdays, or tuesdays and thursdays? Satisfied, I hope. Why do you continue to delay? Grant the third wish! I am your only hope for freedom. Soon the man the waker loves will be removed And she will be free To love me as she wished. We sense your growing enchantment with the waker. Be warned-- this will be the downfall of us all. Silence! Are you crazy? I could have killed you! You are the waker of the Djinn! You must be killed before the third wish is granted! Run away, Lisa! go now! Just keep running. don't turn around! 3000 years between breaths, my friend. How does it feel? It's a pity your life is merely a charade. A titan of such nobility, Bound until the waker makes her third wish to me. A third wish not yet granted. - What stops you? - You, my friend. Destroying you after so many battles Will make the birth of my race that much sweeter. Your human form has made you weak. I sense conflict... emotion. The prophecy will be fulfilled! Your sword is slower than I remember. Playtime is over, hunter. face your true executioner. You hide your true form from the waker And leave your third wish ungranted. Time grows short, demon. Death awaits you at the end of my blade. Death to the Djinn Is merely the moment before being reborn. Unlike the eternal darkness that comes with yours! You grow weary... And there is no escape for you this time. You will make a good first meal for us! Listen carefully, my old friend. The sound of your neck snapping Will usher in a new era on earth. And I will be king of it all. Do you wish a second chance, hunter? Gamble your soul for another attempt at futility? And let you win? I always win! Sam! Sam! Hello? You're safe? Steven, where are you? what just happened? It's over. Everything's fine. What the hell was that all about? He was a former client of mine. Some nutcase who decided he didn't need his medication. Why was he after me? To get to me. How did you even know where I was? I was on my way to your house. I saw your car. I heard you screaming. It doesn't matter. - This guy's never going to see the light of day again. - Oh, god. Is Sam there? No, I don't know where he is. I want you to stay in the house And lock the doors until I get there, understand? - Lisa? - Yeah? Listen, there's something-- There's something I need to tell you. It's complicated. I'm having trouble finding the right words. I'll be here. Good. I'm sure this comes as no surprise. I won't be back. If the impulse to mourn hits you, don't. This way we can both be happy. I talked to Steven and now I understand just how much he cares for you. Be happy, Lisa. Sam. Hi. I was on my way to bring you these when-- That's very sweet. Is everything all right, Lisa? I'm still a little shaken from the whole thing. Sam just-- I know. I'm just glad you're safe. The whole way home I could just imagine the worst. I've been imagining the worst for weeks. I don't understand. I'd help settle your case, And then Sam would find it in his heart to love you again. Everything I'd wished for would be gone. Then when Sam walked again, There would be no reason for him not to embrace you. To fight for your love-- When your love is all I've ever wanted. What's so funny? I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing at me. It's just that, that was really amazing. Now I'm waiting for you to find a subtle way To excuse yourself and leave. Why would I do that? Don't make me start thinking this is all a dream. Isn't it? Lisa... Do you love me for who I really am? I love the way you just made me feel. That's not what i asked. A lot's happened in the last 24 hours. All the more reason to answer me then. Steven. I need to know now, Lisa. It's a simple question. Do you love me for who I really am? Who is the real you, Steven? This was a mistake. This was no mistake. It was a plan. I gave you what you wanted. Oh, thank you for the charity. You said it yourself, you loved the way I made you feel. There's more to love than great sex. Why do you think I stayed with Sam for so long? What I don't understand is why you still care. He left you, Lisa, don't you get that? How would you know that? did you read his note? quite frankly, Steven, Sam would never confide in you. I wrote the note. - You had no right. - I did it for you. - For us. - I want you to leave. - Lisa. - Now! You challenge me by revealing your presence to the waker! You failed to seduce the third wish! She must not escape! Your interference has threatened us all! Leave her to me! Running away is not the answer. Who are you? That's a question not easily answered right now. I am the beast in search of beauty's love. The man who opened his heart to you, Made love with you. A man you trusted with your deepest feelings. And yet, I still deceived you. What does that mean? I'm not who you think I am. I'm trapped. And you are the key to my freedom. If you can find some tiny bit of love in your heart for an ugly creature, You'll release me from my eternal torment. Is love truly blind, my dear? I'm afraid not. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. There is no escape, Lisa. Unless I will it. This place no longer exists as you remember it. I want things back the way they were. Try to look beyond what your eyes see. I am only a monster If you choose to see me as one. I can wear any body you like, Any form you desire. What you felt for Verdel, you can feel for me. just define the world that pleases you, And it's yours. What lies beyond that wall Is only frightening because you can see it. It is merely a face put on the greed, violence and atrocities that humanity already turns a blind eye to. It is easily forgotten if you choose not to look. This is your reality if you wish it, Lisa. With a palace like none this world has ever known. join me. Give your soul freely and be my queen. Anything you can imagine will be yours. The world will be at my fingertips, And I will be at yours. You'll never be sick. You'll never suffer. You'll live forever. - Lisa! - Sam! I had hoped for more! I see now that the power of human love Is wielded by the object of affection, Not by its victim. Here is your knight in shining armor to save you, Lisa! Resurrected from the ashes of misfortune and pity. Haven't you figured it out yet? The fact that Sam can walk again is a testament of my love for you. His legs? I gave them back to him. I can also give him back his pain. Oh, god! God is not invited to this party, Sam. How do your legs feel? You see, there was no miracle. It was merely the second of Lisa's three wishes. The granting of the third wish Is what you've interrupted here. I never made a third wish! I wish I could love you for who you really are. You remember. You see, we've created a bit of a paradox here, Lisa. A wish that only you can grant. But a wish, nonetheless, Which must be granted. stay away from her! A gun? When did you start carrying a gun, Sam? When I found Tracy's body in her apartment. - I expected to find Verdel there-- - He is Verdel, Sam! Better? What're you going to do now, Sam? That's a bit too easy, isn't it? so, let's try this one. it's not really that hard. Think of all the times you wanted to kill yourself. Very nice. Now for the real test of mettle. You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Sam? Not the woman you love. Not the woman who stood by you through all your pain and suffering. - Shoot it, Sam! - I love you, Sam. I always will. Shoot it! Shoot it, it's not me! You can't kill an immortal with a toy. There are many kinds of love, Lisa. It's time we explored some of them. No! A wish! You offered me a wish once before. - Don't! - Is it still mine to make? Your soul for a wish. Don't do it, Sam! it's a trick! Choose your words carefully, Sam. I wish I had a way to kill you! Granted. Now you have the means, all you need is the effort. Now, my turn. Your death... is only the beginning. Your soul belongs to me for eternity. Sam! It doesn't have to be this way, Lisa. I can make this nightmare... end for you right now. Let me give you paradise. Paradise would be one more bullet. Unfortunately, it won't be that easy for you. You've made your wishes. You disappoint me, Lisa! Your fate is inextricably tied to me. It has been so since you found that stone. What's done cannot be undone. Grant the wish or this torment will never end for either of us. I offer you... one last chance to escape the torment that awaits you. Give me your love, and the universe is yours. Not like that. What is it you want? I need Sam back. Lisa. I love you. Be with me forever. Love me like you did before. Oh, Sam.
