According to these pictures over here on the table, she does. Check with the building to see if they have any surveillance tapes, find out if there were any guests in the last 12 hours that she might have had. You know, her other slipper's up here. Yeah? Well, I'm just saying, it's improbable that somebody would wanna walk down the stairs with one slipper. Well, it's late at night, she wants to go to the bathroom, she forgets her slipper. She's disoriented, you know? There's only one point of impact and it's severe enough that she fell from a 12foot height, not rolling down the stairs. You're right. What are you on, Twitter? Put the phone away. I mean, it's within the realm of possibilities that she might have been thrown. Right? "Now that the apartment across the hall is vacant." "I would like very much to discuss purchasing it for myself." "I don't mean to take advantage" "of Mrs. Lonnigan's passing so quickly," "but one must admit that the sweet darling had a good life," "and in fact, lived longer than most people would actually desire." NYPD. Open up. NYPD. "Please also take into consideration" "that I first declared my interest" "over two years ago after she first fell ill." "I shall await your earliest response." "Best, Abigail Clayton." So, can you tell me about the tenants that live across the hall from Mrs. Lonnigan? What are their names? Oh, yeah. That's Abigail Clayton. Abigail Clayton. Well, can you tell me about her? Well, not. Not really, sir. I've actually never met her. You've never met her? No. I'm very sorry. Klandermann. Yes. Just a few more hours, actually, is what I've been told. Can I get a coffee? It's unavoidable, yes. We're so sorry for the... Yes. It is a disturbance. You're... Yup. Thank you. I'm sorry. What were you asking me? You were saying that you've never met the tenant who lives across... No. No, no, I haven't. I've been here now... It's been 11 years. Oh, my. She was in the apartment before I arrived, yes, so we've never met. In 11 years, you've never had any interaction with her personally? That's not completely true, sir. Every day or night at a specific time she will pass a letter to me underneath the door. I'm the only one in the building who communicates with her. Food, clothing, you name it, I deliver it. I leave It In the hallway, I knock, I leave. She never goes out. Ever. Yeah, so, in that sense, we have had communication, yes. That's a little strange. Well, this is Columbus Circle, sir. Nothing seems strange around here. All right, I'm gonna have to ask you to come into the station... Really? ...after you get off. What time will that be? Is that absolutely... Yeah, so... I'm gonna go try one more time. Miss Clayton? Open up, please. It's NYPD. I know you're in there Look, I tried to call, I. I just need two minutes of your time. Fine. We can do this one of two ways. You can let me in now and I'll make it short and sweet or I'll come back later with a warrant and a bunch of other guys. And from what I understand, you won't like that too much. All right, fine, I'll get awarrant. Creepy hallway. Hello? Oh, hey. Uh, Ma'am, I'm so sorry. I just needed to talk to you about your neighbor, if I may. I didn't know her. I'm sorry. I'm very busy right now. Look, nobody... I'm gonna come in here for a second. I'll shut the door. Uh... Look, nobody's in trouble. I'm just following protocol. I just needed a few minutes of your time. You live right across the hall from her. Right. Wow, this is a really beautiful apartment you have. Is that what they teach you in detective school? Charm me with false praise and then we're sitting down for coffee? Well, if you're offering, you know, I'd love a cup of coffee. I... I got here at 6:00 in the morning. I came from another case, I've been up all night. Coffee would be great. You cook? Yes. Are you expecting somebody at this hour? I imagine that you already know the answer to that one. Okay, you got me. That was dishonest. I... Uh... I was just trying to break the ice. Yeah, well, I'm not interested in breaking ice or engaging in small talk, so I'd very much like it if you would just get to the point so that I can get on with my morning. So no coffee? How long have you lived here? You wanted to talk to me about my neighbor? Thank you. Uh... Yeah, that's right. This is really nice. She was old and it's my understanding she was sick for quite a while. I don't know. Well, from what I put together, uh, she was feeling a lot better. You know, she liked to take the stairs instead of the elevator. She preferred to walk instead of taking a cab. Hmm. Well, if you say so. So, your concierge says that you don't like to get out that much. I suppose so. Are you... Uh... What is that? Um... Agoraphobia? Well, if you insist. No, no offense. You know, I suffer from arachnophobia. Really? Mmm-hmm. Yeah. That's a fear of spiders. Well, what I wouldn't do for a shoebox full of tarantulas right now. You're pretty witty for a lady that doesn't get out that much. Are you here to talk about me or Hilary? Hilary? That was her name. But I thought you didn't know her at all. No, Detective, I did not. So why would you call her by her first name if you didn't know her at all? All right. Are we done yet? No. Just a few more minutes. Um, over the last couple of days or weeks, were there any strange visitors or anything out of the ordinary that you were aware of coming from the apartment? No strange sounds last night when she died? Since I don't know when she died, day or night, and since I've already made it clear that I didn't hear anything out of the ordinary coming from her apartment, then I'd venture to guess that we are entering into an area of... Hmm, redundancy? Okay, now we're done. Thank you for the coffee. I'm gonna give you a couple of cards. If you think of anything, uh, call me. Thank you.I will. Okay. Hey, this is a really nice vase. It's a little confusing, but it's nice. I'm sure you could figure it out. Her name is Justine Waters, "and she was known as America's little darling." The sole heiress of the Waters fortune, estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, she mysteriously disappeared Take a look at these home videos of Justine. They show her at the Waters family summer cottage in upstate New York. As you can see, Justine is being filmed showcasing her hula hoop skills. At the time, she held the world record of 14 straight hours. Now, there's been much speculation on Justine's whereabouts. Theories range from her running off with a Saudi prince to her being a victim of foul play. Now while the great and powerful Phillip Waters claimed until his death five years ago that he never stopped looking for his daughter, Justine's 17year silence remains the most talked about missing persons mystery to date. In the days leading up to what would become her historic vanishing act, it was rumored that had just become engaged to Prince Achmed Mustafi of Jordan. What did happen to Justine Waters? And will we ever see her again? I'm Jerry Penacoli for Extra. I'm wondering if you could help me identify this crest? Interesting. Yeah? Why is that? Well, this could be a family crest. This is the letter "M", correct? Well, that was the intention. The drawing is rough, but... Well, where'd you find this? I can't really tell you. I just need to find out what it is. Okay. I got a book in the back, something of an almanac, so to speak. Might be able to find a match. How long do you think... Oh, one second. Yeah? Yeah, I went through all the evidence like you asked. Hey, put it out. Step on it. Yeah, what do you got? Not much. The only thing that might interest you are some prescription medications, but she was an old woman. Well, do we know who the doctor is? Yeah, some doctor in Westchester County. We got a name? Yeah, a Dr. Raymond Fontaine. Okay, one second. Let me give you my card and I'll just wait for your phone call. All right, Frank. Take it easy. All right, thanks, Howie. Well, the view is definitely amazing. As you can see, we're directly over Columbus Circle, which by the way, is the exact point from which all distances to and from New York City are officially measured. The owner completely renovated and refurbished the entire unit with all the latest and greatest amenities. Top of the line kitchen by Pedini. There's only two units on the penthouse level. Twenty four hour doorman, concierge. It's a full-service building. And we are getting another offer later today, so... I think you guys are the right fit. If I were you, I'd make a move. What do you think? I love it. Good. Mmm. They rented the apartment! How could this have happened? I wrote half a dozen letters! I agree, Abby, this is simply outrageous. They haven't returned any of my phone calls, either. Is there anything we can do to stop this? I will look into it immediately. I need to see you, Ray. Abby, I'm busy. I said I need to see you, Ray. I'm in the middle of something. Raymond! Now! You know, the police were here. In my home. Of course the police were here, Abby. And that doesn't bother you? The police were here because Hilary died. She had a fall and they're investigating her death. You live across the hall, so of course they're gonna inquire if you heard anything suspicious. Once they deduce that her death was an accident, which it most certainly was, they'll have no need to bother you any further. One of the detectives left me his card. Oh. Ray, how many wallets have I bought you through the years? Abigail, I'm attached to this. It was a gift from your mother on my first day of medical school. I'll never part with it. It's just that I don't want things to change. Okay? I just need things to stay the same I just need things to continue... Abby, Abby. As they have been. This is a disruption. Well, if change is what you don't want, I strongly advise that you stop inquiring about the apartment across the hall. And it's sort of academic. The apartment is leased. And they're gonna lead their lives just as Hilary led hers. Not a peep! Ray. Abigail. You've gotta trust me, girl. You've gotta calm down. I promise you. Everything'll be fine. Haven't I always been there for you? Hmm? And by "always," I mean for the better part of your life. Okay, sweetie. Good morning, Mr. Stanford. Good morning. Oh, hello, sir. Klandermann. Mr. Stanford, if you don't mind me saying so, I've got this sense that I know you somehow. Really? Yeah. It's as if we... I don't know, we met somewhere or something. I kinda get that a lot. I guess I just have one of those faces. Oh, yeah? Well, that's probably it. Huh. Sure smells good coming out of that loft of yours. I'm guessing Miss Lillian's the... Yeah, she's the chef in the family. Yeah. It's amazing I don't weigh 300 pounds. I don't understand it. Son of a bitch! Well, it's a little too late for that! You started it, Lillian! You son of a bitch! God damn it! Why are you doing this? Jesus! Tell me one more time to keep my voice down, I swear to God... I don't want the help to hear. Who gives a shit? I'm not gonna talk to you when you're like this. I just wanna go inside, okay? Charlie... You're not going anywhere, bitch! Little slut! God damn it, I'm going back inside. We're gonna finish this. Just shut up! Oh, you don't want the help to hear! Well, I'm paying them enough to plug their ears! God damn it. You're drunk! I want to go back inside. You're not going anywhere. Bitch! Did you just hit me? Is that what you did? You don't ever hit me! Bitch! I'm sorry! Don't ever hit Charlie! Do you understand that? Remember where you come from. Remember, you bitch! Miss? Help me. Please. Do I call 911? No. I don't want him to go to jail. You have to stand up. Stand up! Help me. Stand up! Shh. It's okay. Be quiet. Lillian. Shh. Just don't let him in. It's Charlie. I'm sorry. Please just open the door. Come on, I'm sorry. Let's just talk about this Lillian! Shit. Please... Lillian, open the door. Open the fucking door! Oh, great. Mmm. Mmm. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. What are you sorry for? I'm just sorry because you're involved now in this. And I didn't mean for this to happen. Well, you needn't be sorry. He works so hard and when he works, he sometimes gets stressed and when he's under a lot of pressure, he drinks a lot. And I think I set him off, and I don't mean to. I feel so bad. Why are you making excuses for him? 'Cause you really don't know him. He's a really, um... Reliable guy. Stop apologizing for him. Stop it. I do love him. Why would someone kill a violinist? This job really sucks sometimes. Why would an 80 year-old woman wanna jump off her balcony? See this here? This is how I like my crime scene. That over there is a torso, a head, and right down here... Oh, God. What the hell is that? You see, this is what a murder scene looks like. What, so you don't think this is a suicide as well? You, my friend, are a sick bastard. I'm just saying, nine years on the job, it just doesn't add up. What's interesting is the girl across the hall. Oh, I see what this is about. What, she's hot? Yeah, she was attractive. I knew it. No, here's the thing. - I ran her through the system, right? - Please. There's nothing on her. She doesn't have a social security number. She doesn't have a driver's license, nothing. A woman like that, living in Columbus Circle, with all that money? It just doesn't make sense. You know, she hasn't left her apartment in years. This is New York City. It's a town full of nuts. No, she didn't look crazy. How did she look? She looked like a victim. Mmm... Oh, my God. I can't believe I fell asleep here. What time is it? It's almost 8:30. Oh, wow. Almost nine hours. Oh, my God. I'm sorry if I invaded your space. It's all right. Would you like me to pour you some tea? No, no, no, that's okay. I just... I need to get going. Thank you, though. Oh, God, Charlie's gonna kill me. It looks like he already tried to do that last night. Does it look bad? Do you have a mirror? It's right there. Oh... I feel so stupid. No. I do. I just feel so stupid. I don't even know you and here I am dragging you into this. It's all right. God. It's all right. Don't. Don't. Why don't you sit down? I'll pour you some tea. Thank you. You've been so nice. I'm sorry. Charlie's not such a bad guy. I don't want you to hate him. Well, he made a terrible first impression. I know. He did. Can I ask you a question? Why don't you like having any visitors? I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry. That's what the real estate agent said. Well, I guess I just decided a long time ago that I'd rather be alone. That's not so strange. Sometimes I just wanna run away and be somewhere where nobody knows me and I could just start over. I know. So what did you do? I told you. He was coming back. So I went out into the hallway and I brought her in. The hall? You went into the hall? You know, she reminded me of... Well, you know, you were there. And... Well, I was... I was just a child then and, well, I wasnt gonna just stand there and watch this happen. So you called the police, of course. No. What happened? Well, when she woke up this morning... "When she woke up? You mean she slept over?" Well, it was hardly a slumber party, Ray. She was injured and she passed out. What's her name? Lillian. Is she still there? No. She left. She gonna be safe there? I don't know. Oh, Abby. What are you gonna do now? You know as well as anyone this sort of thing only gets worse. I don't know. It's not my responsibility, right? Maybe you should consider that now that you've helped her she'll likely come back to you for help again. Have you thought about what you're gonna do next time? No. Gimme a mini. Yeah. Schmear? I just know I don't wanna be involved. It's a little late for that. And Abigail, it's unfair for you to give her refuge and solace and then when she comes knocking again to ignore her. Maybe you could be proactive and talk to her, help her. I don't know. Well, it's something to consider. She's your neighbor. You have something in common. Maybe you should have her for dinner, over to your place. I don't think I'm entirely comfortable with that idea, Ray. Think about it. All right. Are you eating? Yeah. Bagel with a schmear. Bye. You really banged me up. I'm sorry. I mean it I love you. I love you. Thank you, Bubba. You're welcome, Miss Hart. Miss Lillian, can I help you with that, please? I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! Oh, wait. I've got it. No, don't, wait. You having fun down there, Klandermann? No, sir. No, sir, not at all. I was just trying to help with... I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Let me help. Oh, good. This... I shouldn't see that. It's fine. Okay. All right. I'll get the elevator. There we are. I'm so sorry. I was trying to help. Don't worry about it. There were just so many bags. I didn't realize... It's fine. It's not all for me. I bought you a new tie. A new tie? A new tie? Yeah A new tie. Right here, sir? On the counter, please. Uh! huh! Excuse me, sorry. Thank you. Everything all right, Klandermann? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, no. That's... That's where I found her. Found who? Mrs. Lonnigan, the previous tenant. What do you mean? Well, that's... I was the one that found her. Right here. They said she fell down the stairs. I didn't know that. She was such a sweet old lady, too, you know? Everybody loved her in the building. Always had something sweet to say and always made everybody smile. The whole building loved her, really. That's so sad. I'd just never seen anybody die before. What do you mean? She wasn't dead yet when I found her. No. We got a call, the tenant down below, Henderson, they heard a real loud... And I raced to... And the door was unlocked, which is quite unusual for a building like this, I'll tell you that. But it seemed as if she were still trying to speak. What was she trying to say? Oh, I have no idea. See, I'd never seen anything and there she... It was awful, so it's all kind of a blur now, you know. Yeah. Yeah, that's a shame. I mean, I have an idea I shouldn't say that. I haven't told anybody this before, but when I found her it sounded like she was trying to say, uh, "Why?" "Why?" But it was a "Why me?" "Why did this happen to me?" kind of "why." Does that make any, uh... I'm so sorry. I should not be here. I'm so sorry to take up your time. Do you need any help unloading these bags at all or... I'll remember how I know you, Mr. Stanford. I swear I will. I'm so sorry I haven't. All right, let me know when you do. Sure thing. What was that about? He thinks he knows me. Does he? I don't think so. Hi. Sorry. This, um... From... You're good? Thank you. Okay. Before you moved around, you were just in Bakersfield that whole time? Bakersfield, California. My mom drank, mostly to get away from my father, who also drank. Hmm. Was he abusive? Yeah. That's pretty much why I left, because I couldn't take it any more. I was 15 and I had $7.20 to my name. And I had fallen in love with Charlie and he's pretty much just taken care of me. I couldn't... I couldn't stay with someone who hurt me. I mean, we have a good time, but I don't really... I wouldn't really have anything without him I just couldn't do it. So what's the alternative? Would you like some more wine? Yes, please. So where's your family? My mom died. And your father? He's dead, too. Oh. Were you close with them? I was close with my mother. Mmm-hmm. My dad... My dad drank as well and he'd fly off the handle. He'd go into these rages. And he would beat my mother and me when I tried to protect her. Mmm-hmm. Hmm. My father could control anything. So you grew up rich? I suppose. Well, I grew up in the trailer park. Lucky me. Do you have any brothers or sisters? Nope. Just me. You? No. Just me, too. So how'd you disappear? Haven't I always been there for you? My father had a friend. My father had a friend and he knew how bad my father could be and what he was capable of, so he helped me to... He helped me. You know, I didn't intentionally... I didn't set out intentionally. to not go out again. I just... You know, I went to the grocery store and I'd sneak out at night, go to Central Park. I was always amazed at how quiet everything was. Such a big city. I wanna take you outside. There's this flower shop. It's a block away. I wanna take you there. It smells so incredible and I wanna pick out your favorite flowers. And then a block further is this rare bookstore that smells kind of musky and it has the most incredible books, and there's this window seating and we can pick out some books and read together. I don't think I'd feel safe. I would be with you, protecting you. You can't stay in here for the rest of your life. Look at you. You're so beautiful. You're stunning. I wanna take you out into the world. You smell his lavender? Let's see if he's in the backyard. This is a nice house. I should've been a doctor. Hello? You smell paint? Oh, for Christ's sake. My good shoes. My mom's gonna have a fit. I just painted that porch. I'm so sorry. We had no idea. I'm so sorry. You must be Dr. Ray Fontaine? Yes. Yeah, I'm Detective Frank Giardello. This is my partner, Jerry Eaans. Two detectives and you couldn't figure out the porch was freshly painted? We're really sorry. We were wondering if we could have a few minutes of your time. Sure. Would it be all right if we spoke out here? Uh... Oh, yeah. That would be fine. Yeah, we wanted to talk to you about Mrs. Hilary Lonnigan. Sure. What about her? Well, I'm sure that you're aware that she passed away a couple of weeks ago. Of course. I was her doctor. Yeah. Could you tell us about her health? She'd been ill for awhile. Oh, yeah, she was ill. With what? Cancer. Mmm. It was in remission, actually. Any dizzy spells, anything like that? She never complained of any. She did have tendencies to push herself. She was one of those people who didn't like standing still. Why? Well, she was pretty badly injured. Well, she did fall down the staircase. Yeah. What are you suggesting? Oh, no, no. We're not suggesting anything. We're just trying to find out whether or not we have a homicide on our hands. We'd like to see her medical records, if that's all right. Of course. I'd need a subpoena. - Doctor patient confidentiality. - Of course. Why don't we do this? Why don't I give you one of my cards... Thank you. All right. ...and we'll be in touch. It was a pleasure to meet you. Yeah, it's good to meet you. What's your dog's name? Oh, this is Digger. Digger? Yeah. All right. Thanks. All right. Oh! By the way, do you know Abigail Clayton? Uh, again, Officer, doctor patient confidentiality. Oh. Yeah. We don't want to take up any more of your time. Thank you. Thank you. You gentlemen have a good evening. You, too. Stop that. What? Well, I didn't ask him if she was a patient. I asked him if he knew her. You're doing good. You're doing great. Good. Amazing, Abigail. Abigail... Lillian, why are we even doing this? I don't want to leave. We're doing this because it's good to get out of the apartment. You're doing beautifully. Look at you. That's enough, Lillian... No, no, no. Okay, okay. Great. You're doing great. I don't feel well. It's okay. I know. This is far enough. You're doing great. I'm here for you. I'm here for you. Abigail. Hold the door. Oh! I got it, sir. I got it. Come on in. There you go. We're gonna at least walk to that table over there. No, I think we've gone far enough. Everything all right tonight? Sir? Uh-huh! Good. I'm not ready yet. Okay! Okay! Okay. Okay. Hey, this is me. I just remembered where I know you from. Yeah. One, two, three. Come on! There you go! Good! Great job! Great job! Beautiful. Oh, God. You must be Abigail. You feeling all right, sweetheart? Here, let me help. Huh? Don't touch her! Don't touch her, please! Just don't. Okay! Okay! Don't, don't. Please don't. Charlie, please. You ladies have a good night. Just stay here for a second. No, no! Please don't go in there! Please don't! Charlie, what are you doing? I don't want him to be in my apartment. Stay right here. He's violent! He's in my apartment. Abigail! When you get her out of her apartment, I install some computer software so that when she goes online, we'll be able to get her banking password. Right. Got it. Got it? It's like stealing the identity of a ghost. Exactly. She wants to remain hidden. And after we've got the money, who the hell is she gonna run to? We've got her account information, her social security number, her signature, but we still need to get your fake ID. It's just so perfect. We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. No more nickel and dime shit. Just sunsets and mimosas, baby. And once we get the password we're home free. Happy birthday. Thank you. I love you, baby. I love you. Abigail, please! What is he doing in my apartment? He's been drinking! Abigail! He's been drinking. You can't, no. He gets really violent. You don't want him to hit you. You don't want him to hit you. You know what it feels like. Stay here. Hey! That's not my apartment. I'm right here. I'm right here. Abigail. I wanna go home. I live in here and this is how I want it. I want to be alone. This is how I want it. You did a great job tonight, Abby. I cannot have people in my life. I cannot have people in my life. I cannot have you in my life. If he is in your life, I can't... No, I wanna be alone I wanna be alone. I wanna be alone. Okay. Okay. I'm really sorry about Charlie. Stop apologizing. He's... He is dangerous and he will only end up hurting you more than he already has. Please go. Okay. Please go. Thank you so much for dinner tonight, Abigail. ANSWERING MACHINE First new message. Sent today at 9:17 p.m. Mr. Stanford? It's Joe Klandermann. I guess now I should call you Charlie since we go back, huh? Anyway, if you're having trouble remembering me, think back 12 years ago to a holding cell. Rah way Prison? Remember? You were about to do a five year stretch on some con and I was on my way out after doing a deuce. Good times. Yeah. Enough reminiscing. Meet me at the coffee shop around the corner on 59th Street right after I get off work. We need to talk. You're gonna cut me in on whatever scam you're running, Charlie. I don't know what it is, of course, but you living here means it's gotta be big. Yeah. Don't make me wait, partner. Damn it. You're crazy attacking me! You're a dead man! You hear me? You're a dead... Tonight's top story is the bizarre death of a wanted felon on Columbus Circle. We go now live to Diane Weiss, who's on the scene. Apparently, Diane, the man was strangled before being hit by a bus? Yes, Ginger. Police believe the victim may have been fleeing from an attacker. However, the victim, Joseph Klandermann, whose real name was Nathaniel Muskit, was a wanted felon. Charlie? Muskit disappeared nearly 12 years ago and had eluded authorities for that long. Charlie? He was convicted in a Ponzi scheme that bilked investors... You killed Klandermann? Charlie? Charlie, we don't kill people! Lillian. No, Charlie. This is the one. This is the one we've been waiting for, Charlie! He could have turned us in. I made a decision to protect us. You made a stupid decision, Charlie. I don't wanna run from the cops! You don't have to be scared. Okay? It's gonna be fine. It's okay. What does that say? He wants to see us. Yeah. Klandermann's dead, Ray. He's dead. I know, I heard. Are you all right? I don't know. I don't know. What am I gonna do? They will get a new concierge. Ray, you know I can't trust a new concierge. I can't trust a new concierge. Klandermann had been here so long. How am I gonna trust a new concierge, Ray? Ray, I need to see you. I can't right now. I promise I'll come by later. Please, Ray? I really need to see you. I'll see you later tonight. You just relax. Take a long breath now. For me, okay? Bye. This has gotten completely out of hand. I understand. No, I don't think you do. It's all over the television. I mean, Mrs. Lonnigan was one thing. That had to be done. And so did Klandermann. Charlie? But there was a mistake made with Mrs. Lonnigan. What are you talking about? What is he talking about? When were you gonna tell me this, Charlie? This is not the time or the place for this. Ray, what do you mean "mistake"? There was obviously a serious error made. We wanted to talk to you about, uh, Mrs. Hilary Lonnigan. The police were here, investigating a homicide, not a slip and fall of an 82 year-old woman. I don't make mistakes. Oh, apparently, you do. Otherwise they wouldn't be investigating a homicide, Charles. Jesus Christ. Now thanks to me, Mrs. Lonnigan lived a long and prosperous life, three years longer than I anticipated, and there's only a certain amount of time one can wait. But this is over now. We need to discuss an exit strategy. No, there is no exit strategy. We're one e-mail away from a fortune. Charles, how long do you think it's gonna take for them to figure out I'm the one who owns the apartment? That I paid for the whole thing? It's my money! Once they figure that out, it's a short walk in the park for them to put together who Abigail is. And what we're all up to. We need to discuss an exit strategy. He may be right, Lillian. It's just a shame. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go water my plants, get over to Abigail's, take out her trash, pick up her cleaning, and give her a foot massage to calm her down, thanks to you. I guess I'm doomed to take care of this woman the rest of my life. What do we do? Let me try to talk to him Lillian. Please go in the house and make it look like it was robbed. Okay? Did you roll the body? Yeah. Did you get the phone? It wasn't in the house? No. It has all our information. I know. Do we walk? No. No. We don't walk. We're too close. With no money, how far would we get? Look, we knew that if things went wrong we'd have a backup plan, and we do. Okay? We have to force her hand. Okay? We have to do it now. It's gonna be okay. Please! Please, I need you! Open up! Hurry, please! Please! Open up! Let me in! Open the door and let me in! He's gonna kill me, Abigail! Please! Please, Abigail! Open the door, please! Please, Abigail! Please! Open the door! Open the door! Oh, my God! Charlie, calm down! Calm down! Think you're gonna leave me? No, I'm not, I swear! Huh? You gonna leave me? I'm not gonna leave you, Charlie! Please! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Okay? No, no, no. No! Don't you... Bitch! Get back here! Gimme the gun! Gimme the gun! The gun! Gimme the gun! I'm gonna shoot you, Charlie! I'm gonna shoot you! You're gonna shoot me? I'll shoot you, Charlie! Do it! Charlie. Stop! Oh, my God! Stop! No! What are you doing? Stop! Oh, my God! No! No! Get off him. Oh, my God! What are you doing? What are you doing? Charlie! Charlie, no! Charlie, no! Charlie, wake up! Wake up, Charlie, my baby. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Charlie, wake up! Wake up, Charlie! You killed him, Abigail! What have you done? What have you done? No! I didn't do it. No, you did. You shot him! No! My baby. Oh, Charlie. I have to call someone. Charlie, don't leave me. Abigail, no, you can't call anybody! Are you crazy? Nobody can know about this. No, Abigail! We just murdered Charlie. We have to leave. We have to get out of here. No, no, I can't go anywhere! We're one e-mail away from a fortune. I'm all alone and I don't know what to do now and I need to go. Please, Abigail, help me. We need to scrape whatever money we can together and I need to get out of here. Okay? I have money. I don't have any cash. We can transfer money from my account. And once we get the password we're home free. I wish I could talk to Ray. No, you can't talk to Ray. You can't talk to anybody. I trust him. Look at me. We can only trust each other now. Okay? Mmm-hmm. Okay. Really? Are you kidding me? You're positive? Same guy? So what'd you find out? Well, I don't think that this is an "M" you brought me, Detective. What do you mean? I think it's a... And if it is, it could very well be the crest for the Waters family. Are you familiar with the Waters family? Yeah, of course, of course. Yeah. This is incredibly exciting. Is there any chance that you could tell me exactly where you saw this? I'm sorry, I can't do that. I just found out Mrs. Lonnigan's apartment was paid for by a corporation. Apparently, she was a nanny for some rich family. Guess who runs the corporation? Who? Dr. Raymond Fontaine. Really? Let's go pay the good doctor a visit. Thanks, Howie. Anytime, Frank. The porch was repainted. Anything? No. Dr. Fontaine? Hello? NYPD. I'll go this way. Frank. Check this out Ray, Ray... It's not mine. I'm heading out. Why don't you go take a shower and by the time you're ready, I will be back. Okay. And then we'll take care of... Don't go anywhere. Where would I go? Miss Clayton, it's Detective Giardello. Yes, Detective? Look, I'm not calling with the best of news. My partner and I tracked down Dr. Fontaine and I'm sorry to inform you that he was found dead. He's been murdered. If you are who I think you are, I think you're at the center of something very dangerous. I'm sorry, Miss Clayton. What do I do? Look, we're on our way. We're gonna be there in an hour. Don't leave and don't answer the door, all right? Thank you, Detective. Let's go. I just know I don't wanna be involved. I think you should have her for dinner. I wanna take you outside. She reminded me of... Well, you know, you were there. Well, I was... I was just a child then. No, you can't talk to Ray. You can't talk to anybody. You've gotta trust me, girl. Excuse me. I'd like to see someone about closing an account. That would be Mr. Ross, the bank manager. His desk is right over there. Thank you. Giardello. Detective, this is Abigail Clayton. We're on our way. Ls everything all right? On your way? Yeah, since we last spoke. Since we last spoke? Two weeks ago? No, we spoke less than a half hour ago. No, you must be mistaken. I was in the shower. I didn't take any calls. That wasn't you I was talking to? No. Oh, my God. How can I help you? I'd like to close out an account. All right. You can hang on to this. All righty. Account closure. Um... May I have the account pass code, please? Hulahoop14. Oh... Oh, there we go. All right, Miss Clayton. Everything appears to be in order here. Wonderful. Now, before we finish, I'm required to ask you a few questions. I apologize. It'll just take a few minutes of your time. Justine Waters has decided to come out of hiding. Out of ink. Oh, it's gonna be one of those days, all right. She will be at the Waters Bank, 59th and Broadway. All right. Were you at anytime dissatisfied with our service? No. Glad to hear it. She goes by the name Abigail Clayton and... May I ask, what are your reasons for withdrawing your money? She'll be wearing a black dress. I'm leaving the country. Wonderful! Are you going to Europe? I was just in Paris with my fiance. We stayed at... Oh, God, what is the name of that hotel? It was great. It had these butlers in it and... Oh, man, what is the name of that hotel? Excuse me. Fellas, how's it going? Looks like you guys got a busy day ahead of you, huh? Make sure you stay hydrated out there. Remember, only stop at the red lights and the short skirts, huh? Okay. Are you all right? Yes... Yes, I'm... I just need to hurry. I have a plane to catch. Ah. Leaving things till the last minute, huh? A woman after my own heart. My father always says, "If you didn't do it at the last minute," "you didn't do it right." That's funny. Yeah. He's a funny guy. Finally, is there anything we can do to improve? No. You've been great. Well, thank you. Okay. So... Are there any other questions I can answer for you before we liquidate your account? Yes. Can you give me the account balance? Not a problem. Seven twenty. Yeah. You want it all in singles? Are you gonna buy France? Oh, my God. You are a card. No, $7.20. So did you want that in a cashier's check? $7.20. Is that... Is that not accurate? I had $7.20 to my name. Miss Clayton, are you all right? Psst. What are you doing here? I left. I couldn't stay there any more. You made sure of that. Can we go someplace and talk? I don't think there's time for that, Abigail I made some phone calls. Phone calls? Yeah. I called a whole bunch of people. I mean, you've been in hiding for a long time. This is your big coming out party, Abigail. Why do you keep calling me Abigail? That's what you told the man your name was. Didn't you? That's what you wanted to do. Steal my life, look like me, steal my money. Or maybe it's Justine. I'm sorry. I have so much to tell you. Gee, I don't think we have much time, so I hope it's not a long story. Please. There's gotta be another way. You should leave. Go. There's a body in your apartment. Black dress, black dress. Excuse me! Excuse me, are you Justine Waters? Go away! No! Where to? Kennedy Airport. What's all that about? They just found that girl, Justine Waters. Oh, no kidding. No bags? No baggage... So where you going? Someplace safe and warm. Ah. Safe and warm. I always wanted to go there myself, ma'am. No, not ma am. You can... You can call me Lillian.
