[Stanley]It was third grade. The teacher was Miss Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy. She smelled funny. - But she was kind. - Class! How many times have I told you? In this class... we do not pound ten-penny nails into Stanley's head! [Stanley] You know how some teachers have those kinda flaps on their arms-- those big sacks of limp flab that, like, dangle? - Aahh. - It sounds weird, but for some reason, as I watched those big old flaps of hers, - I began to feel... - [ Sighs ] oddly... aroused. And then the horror began. - [ Laughing ] - [ Gasps ] [ Grunting ] Young man, what's that in your lap? Oh, it was useless--like putting a baseball cap on the Washington Monument. And then, all at once, there he was-- Monkeybone! - Hey, baby, I love your way! - Oh! -$$ Yo, monkey$$ -$$Monkeybone$$ -[Miss Hudlapp]Ooh! -$$Monkeybone$$$$ Moo-coo! Moo-coo! Moo-coo! Moo-coo!

Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with a bunch of these media creeps. I just want to be us, home, alone. Come on. Besides, I have something that I - I want to give to you. Can't you give it to me later? Yes, I could, but if later got here sooner, it-- it would be a lot better. Hi, Herb. - Ah, yes. - Herb-- Yeah. Oh-- Yeah, that'll be good. You got everything? Ah, yeah. Stu, these are just prototypes. They aren't the real products. Just something for you to take home. Just spend some time with them, get a feeling for them before you say "no." - No. - [ Squeaks ] Stu, come on. One more thing. Actually, there's a couple of trucks to come with, you know, Monkeybone stuff. - You guys mind waiting a little longer? - [ Car Starts ] Good night, Herb. Of course. You guys get outta here.

Our father took a long time to die, so Stu and I made a pact... that... when our time came... we wouldn't let it drag out. So... - which one's the plug? - What plug? The plug? The one you pull? Oh, God, Kimmy. Don't even talk like that. I need a realistic answer, Doctor! Give me a date! All right. Three months. There's always some brain damage, but after three months... the chances of coming back shrink dramatically every day. Well, I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We could... certainly give it... [ Sighs ] three months. [Owl Hooting] Oh, poor Buster! He hasn't eaten all day. What's that? [Dog Whimpers] Stu did this? Yeah, right about the time we met, when he first came to the sleep lab. Jesus, honey. He hadn't had a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd just start right in painting. How do you go from here... to cartoons? -Switch hands. - What? Stu was right-handed, so I made him switch the pen to his left hand... to see what would come out, and we got the first Monkeybone. - Wow. Two guys in the same brain. - Yeah. Which one did you fall in love with? $$$$[Nightclub Music] [Bull] Hey, Stu, why so glum? At least they haven't pulled the plug yet. Have another 'tini.

You seem... tense. It's my girlfriend. I'm starting to think I'll never see her again. -[Monkeybone Struggling] - Why didn't I just propose? Right there. At least that way I'd know what she said. - I'd know if she's waiting for me. - She is waiting for you, Stu. I know she is. - Guys like you don't come around often. - Ahh! [ Sighs ] I mean it, Stu.

Pull the plug, pleas-- - No! That's wrong. Julie would never agree to that. They're pulling the plug at 9:00 a.m. Anybody that dumb deserves to die! - Can't you help me? - Stu, I'm just the god of sleep. - This is Death's bailiwick. - Death? [ Grunts, Sighs ] [ Panting ] Cheating Death-- and this is extremely off the record-- what you gotta do... is go into the Land of Death, sneak up right under Death's nose... and steal one of those Exit Passes. Well, Hyp, thanks for the idea, and good luck with the shock therapy. - [ Laughing ] - [ Hissing ] Will you shut up? He gave you a sign? It doesn't sound rational, okay? It's not rational. I don't care anymore, Alice. We've got exactly six hours to wake him up. Hey, look! Mr. Green Stain's got a dead one. What do we do now? [Stu]He's taking her to the Land of Death.

Shh! Come on, come on! Look what I found. [ Chuckles ] - Whoo! Well, that's worth knowing. - [ Moaning ] [ Both Screaming ] Chart number one is from five years ago. This is the worst nightmare Stu had at the sleep lab-- abnormally intense alpha wave activity with a peak that lasted over a minute. And this-- Alice-- this is earlier today. - Holy shit. - Wow. He's caught in a loop-- a nightmare loop. - Does everybody know what Oneirix is? -[Man]It's nightmarejuice. If those charts are right, Stu's swimmin' in the stuff. - We can decrease the levels. - No, I want to give him a massive dose. - That's not gonna stop his nightmare. - Hutch, I don't want to.

That's why we grabbed your body. - I'm no nightmare-maker. - That's the monkey's job. - Monkeybone? What? - [ Laughs Maniacally] Let's face it, Stu. Nobody wants to be a figment. It's a dead-end career.

Let go of my pants! - Stu? - [ Snores ] - Where have you been? - Hmm? Nowhere. I was asleep. Honey, don't lie to me. I know you went out. Nope. Not me. You must be dreaming. I know what this is about. You've been mad because I haven't proposed to you. Oh, go on, admit it! You've been giving me the stinkeye ever since that business with the banner. - You, you and that dog. - I have not been giving the stinkeye. You're giving me the stinkeye right now. Stu, you're wearing shoes and a poncho... with no pants, in bed. [ Mutters ] I know. [Distant Screaming] Well, did you all have sidekicks-- figments, monkeys? A raven. Mine was a dog. Man's best friend. [ Scoffs ] I went through hell to get that Exit Pass. And who got to use it? Cujo. Miley, you got a visitor! Kitty! Oh God, Stu, I'm so sorry. I wanted to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you. Thank you, Kitty, but that doesn't matter right now. The woman I love is living with a horny little monkey that looks like me. - What a lucky girl. - Kitty, listen. Is there any way I can get a message to warn her about what Monkeybone is up to? - Time's up! Break it up! Let's move! - No, no. No! - Give me a moment,just to look at him. - Let's go! - Stu! - Feeding time! As you know, Burger God is prepared to launch... our new Mega Monkey Meal. - Uh, something wrong? -A pig gut! - How much is McDonald's offering? - Less. A pleasure to be in business with you. [ Laughing ] Here's another thing. The Natural History Museum is kicking off... a fund-raising campaign and wanna know if you can appear at a benefit. Oh, I get it. We give the public the impression... that we're doing something charitable-- brilliant! Yes. Yes, that's it exactly. Now, I think you remember Bill here from Bazoom Toys. We have a little something here we think you might just like. It's a prototype. Codename: Little Jack Horner. Go ahead, pull out his thumb. - [ Trumpets ] - [ All Laughing ] - No, it's mine! - Oh. Say, could you fill these babies up with a particulate solution... of one part powdered chemical enzyme to ten parts water? - Uh,Jerry? - Sure. - Yeah, yeah, I guess we could. - All right! You've got yourself a deal! - [ Trumpeting ] - [ All Laughing ] Shall we shake on it? Shake on it? That's not the way we do things in Monkey Land. In Monkey Land, we rub our bottoms together. Huh? You heard the man. Get your asses on the table. [ Cackling ] The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmarejuice. It's gotta be. Julie, that stuff probably saved his life. He's not Stu anymore. The Stu I love is gone. He spends all his time in the garage. He says that he's... autographing. [ Laughing ] Nightmare in a butt! - [ Trumpets ] - [ Laughing ] -[Buster Barking] - Huh? I think I hear a guinea pig. [Buster Continues Barking] Listen, let's bring him in for some tests. I guarantee you're overreacting. [ Buster Barking ] Oh, actually, no, I don't think I'm overreacting. - [ Screaming ] - [ Barking ] [ Growling, Barking ] - [ Trumpets ] - [ Whimpers ] Sweet dreams, you little bastard. [Cats Meowing] [Hypnos]Dog dreams? This is completely humiliating. That stinkin' monkey. I can't believe it. We give him a body, and he sends us dogs. Shh. Let's not think about dogs. Let's think about... pussycats. Oh. [ Laughs ] Oh, what a luscious surprise. [ Laughs ] [ Both Laughing ] So, I thought, "What the hell. I'm a big celebrity now. I can get all the chicks I want. Why get married?" On the other hand, if you are married, no more stinkeye. Plus, they can't testify against you. Testify about what? [ Phone Ringing ] - Hello. -Julie, it's Hutch. - Oh, Hutch. What? - The nightmarejuice-- it's gone. Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid. Grape Kool-Aid? But who'd wanna-- Stu, are you sure you just wanna give these away? - It seems wrong. - Go, go, go, go! Stu. Stu! Shh. Sh-sh-sh-sh. Here. You'll need these for your trip. What? And this. Kitty, you can't do this. You're gonna get in trouble. You're the one true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours, and you make her happy. Thank you. What about the guard? I'll take care of that rat. [ Purring ] Okay, Stu. I'll see you tomorrow. Good-bye, Kitty. - [Guard]Hey, lady, what are you-- - [Kitty Snarling] [Kitty And Guard Fighting] [Guard Screams, Gurgles] - [ Gasps ] - Go!Just go! Well, thank you, Kitty. I'll never forget you. And I mean that. I'll really... never forget you. [Kitty Snarling, Guard Screaming] Last one. [ Vocalizing ] What kind of idiot sneaks into the Land of Death twice? One that likes a good stretchin'? [ Laughs ] Shut up. I wanna hear what he has to say. Now, Death, I know you're mad at me, and I don't blame you. But we're both mad at DownTown, and we're both mad at your brother, Hypnos. So now you're gonna tell me it's all his fault and you were completely innocent. No, I'm not gonna tell you that. I wanted that Exit Pass. I wanted it bad enough that I had to stare you right in the face to get it. Why? Because I-- I got a girl up there, and I shoulda-- I-I never-- I wanna tell her that I love her. Oh, gosh, he loves her. That changes everything. - Ow! Okay, uncle! - Sit down. Sit down right now. Down, down! And don't say another word. Look. I'm a simple person. I do an honest day's work. Why does everybody make it so hard for me? You're switching bodies. You're stealing Exit Passes. I work a long enough day as it is. Look, you can take my soul. I-I don't need it. You can turn me into a paper doll. Just, please, give me one hour. That's it. [ Assistant ] Hey, I love my girlfriend. Well... you're gonna need a new body. You know... I don't generally do this, but... I really like your comic strip. - Really? - Yeah, it slays me. Death, coming from you, that's, you know, that's-- Whew! It's nothin'. But turn around before I change my mind. - Huh? Oh. - Turn around. All right, could you bend over, Stu, please? - Huh? Bend over? - Yeah, just bend over. All right. Bye-bye. [ Screaming ] Come on. Come on. Oh, yeah. Come on. Fresh pancreas. That oughta pay for that new Mercedes. And preparing to detach my round-the-world cruise. [ All Screaming ] Where am I? What's wrong with my neck? You broke it. You're an organ donor. [ Bones Cracking ] Those are our organs. Get back on that slab! I will need this body! - So, get back! - Hey! - 'Cause I gotta-- - It's a bone saw! Yeah! Aah! Oh, look! - Get back here with that body! - Whoa! Oh! - What are you doing? - Sorry! Sorry! That's our body! Whoa! - There he goes! - Get him! Get him! [Indistinct Yelling] [ Tires Squeal ] Hey, Mr. Snyder, hey! Oh, wow. Garden's lookin' good. - Uh, I apologize... - [ Bones Crack] for my appearance, but I'm your-- Please, please, please, just don't call the cops, okay? [ Grunting ] Julie! [ Bones Cracking ] [ Buster Whimpering ] Buster! Oh, how've you been, buddy, huh? You been good? You been a good dog? Huh, yeah? What do you got here for me, huh? What's this? I look like an idiot. Damn! [ Buster Barking ] Stay. Stay. Good dog. [ Barking ] Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hey, bus, wait! Hey! Damn! Hey! Hi. Sorry. - The organs are, uh, in transit. - There he is! - He's on the bus! - They're in perfect working order. They're working even better than we expected. So, let's see what this... particulate solution is all about. - [ Trumpets ] - Oh! Oh! [ All Laughing ] Damn, what the hell is this stuff? [ Sighs ] [Door Creaking] Oh, man. Oh, this is weird. [ Shuddering ] [Distant Screaming] Come back here, you! Oh, my God, we've got a flasher. - Isn't that Herb? - Must be some publicity stunt. The clothes have turned evil! They're working together-- shirts, socks! Whole ensembles! For God's sakes, get rid of your tie! No, no, no, Herb, you ding-dong. - [ Herb Screaming ] -[Policeman]Come back here. Stop! Uh, ladies and gentlemen. [ Chuckles ] Forget about the naked man with the purple face. [ All Laughing ] Your incredible, misguided generosity... has made this a very special day for the museum. And also a very special day for me. All thanks to a very special lady-- Ms. Julie McElroy. Julie, take a bow! On your feet, girl! Give it up for Julie! Stand up! Stand up! Lookin' good. Oh! $$$$[Funk] - [ Laughing ] - Unh! Unh, unh, unh. Oh, she's a brick House  She's mighty, mighty Just lettin' it all hang out  Oh, she's a brick $$House$$ That lady's stacked and that's a fact  Ain't holdin' nothing back $$She knows she's got everything$$ $$Everything$$ - That a woman needs to get a man  - Yeah, yeah, yeah  $$How can she lose with the stuff she use$$ $$ Thirty-six, twenty-four thirty-six$$ $$ Oh, what a winning hand 'Cause she's a brick$$ -$$House$$ -$$Brickhouse$$ $$ That lady's stacked and that's a fact$$ $$Ain't holdin' nothing back$$ $$Shake it down, shake it down Shake it down now$$ Shake it down, shake it down Shake it down now  $$Shake it down, shake it down Shake it down now$$ - She's a brick - [ Applause ] You're mighty mighty, and I'm lettin' it all hang out. How about it,Julie? But it looks so new. Uh, well, that's because it is new. But... the heirloom ring-- your grandmother's ring. What, you want a used ring? [ Tires Squealing ] There he is! $$$$[''Olympic Fanfare, Bugler's Dream''] Get him! Stop that dead man! We're doctors! We don't wanna hurt you! We just want your organs! [ Buster Whimpering ] -[Surgeon]Stop running! - No! - Then you'll be sued! - Fine! Damn you, dead man! - Hey! - Invi-- Invitation only. We don't need invitations, we've got diplomas. Julie? Operators are standing by. Offer expires at midnight. Doc, don't do it! He isn't Stu. He's Monkeybone! All right, let's go. That's it. Say, babe, what did that creep call you? He called me "Doc." [People Chanting]Show me the monkey! Show me the monkey! - Come on, fella, let's go. - [ Struggling ] Please, please! I have to talk to this man. Okay. Who are you? Why did you-- Why did you say those things? Doc, it's all a mix-up. We were in the Land of Death, he stole my Exit Pass... and that's how Monkeybone got my body. See, all they had left for me was this stinking corpse. - Thank you. - Doc. No, don't walk away! He's only here to give people nightmares. Doc, the dream-- don't you remember? They were pulling the plug, and I called out to you. And you heard me, remember? - [ Buster Barking ] - Buster? Yeah, come here, fella. Don't lie to me. Is it-- Is it you? I had to come back,Julie. I had to give you this. I meant to give it to you before, the night it happened. I was happy,Julie. I really was. Just try to remember me like that. Okay? Not like this. [Grunting, Snorting] What's wrong? I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm all dried up. Ladies and gerbils, you know the next part. It's 50 bucks a swat. Who's up first? Oh, yeah. No, this one's on me. [ Laughs ] Here's your bat, babe. Step right up. Just cock the bat like this. That's good. - It's all right. - [ Gasps, Grunts ] [ All Gasp ] We have to stop this. Those dolls have been tampered with. They're toxic. Oh, that's okay, honey. No problem. No. Monkeybone? Back in the pack. - Stu? - I mean it this time. Back in the pack! Eek! Uh-- [ Chuckles ] I can explain everything. I was tired of being a figment. It's dirty, menial work. It's kind of like being a pool boy. But even pool boys have their own bodies. Don't I at least deserve a body? Not my body! You get back in the pack, you bastard! [ Whimpering ] Back in the pack? With the stinky gym socks and the moldy cheese sticks? No! I've got the body, and I am never getting back in that goddamn pack! [ Shrieks ] Oh, no, please, they're dangerous! No, you can't! [ Shrieks, Chittering ] Come on. Excuse me. What is he doing? - He's gonna jump. - [ Cackling ] [ Gasps ] I love you. - No! - Monkeybone! Let go, let go, let go! - Did you sleep with my girl? - Sleep with her? - We did the whole Kamasutra twice. - Oh, yeah? Where's her birthmark? [ Both Screaming ] Come on. [ Screaming ] - [ All Screaming ] - [ Screams ] Bingo! Hey, where'd you get that body? It's a loner, okay? - You sprung a leak. - [ Screams ] Ooh! I think it can be saved. Put it on ice. - [ Chattering, Yelling ] - Don't move. I'm coming at ya! - [ Screaming ] Damn it! - [ Grunts ] - Whoa! - I'll take that, young man. Here, have another. I'm dead. No, stop! That's ours! - Thanks. - That's mine! - Ha ha! - Ha ha! [ Screaming ] Come on, Monkeybone, let's do it! Manoamano! Hey, Stu, I got an idea-- joint custody. - I get the body on weekends, you get-- - Shut up! I think I can bring 'em down. No! Please, wait! - [ Screaming ] - [ Screaming ] [ All Gasping ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Screaming ] [ Both Screaming ] [ All Groaning ] [ Both Screaming ] Where's my body? Where's my body? - You mean my body. - Crap, we're dead! [ Both Screaming ] - [ Cheering, Yelling ] - A hundred bucks on the monkey. [ Both Screaming ] [ Rumbling ] Closing time. Monkey-killer! Monkey-- [ Groans ] [ Screaming ] [ Roars ] Oh! Ha! [Indistinct Scatting] Hey! Hey, whoo! - Whoo-hoo. Hey! -[Stu]Death! Stu! You think I gilded the lily a little? I do like to dress up when I come downtown. So, how was she? She, uh-- She was beautiful. Ofcourse, I was decomposing at the time, but at least now she knows how much I love her. So, I guess I'm yours. Uh, excuse me, Death. [Chuckles] I hate to break up this little lovefest, but my little bladder is about to burst. [ Screams ] But I really gotta go! [ Groaning ] Hey, where-- where's Monkeybone? Back in your head where he belongs. Stu, I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but on your own, you're a tad vanilla, so I didn't want to send you back without him. What back? D-Did you-- You're sending me back? - Yeah, I'm sending you back. - Thank you, Death. I like you. I'll take the South Park guys instead. I hear they're dying to meet me. [ Laughs ] Come on, Stu, come on. Turn around. - So, I should assume the-- - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Stu? A little higher. - Yeah. Oh. - See ya! - [ Screaming ] [ Razor Buzzing ] Excuse me, that's our corpse. We've been chasing it all over town. Help yourself, pal. All right, smart-ass, you prepared to cooperate now? - [ Grunts ] - [ All ] Whoa! [ Gasps ] Huh? Uh, buddy, could I borrow your um-- - [ Whimpering ] - Thank you. [Buster Whimpering] [ Barking ] Hey, buddy. How are you, huh? [Laughing] How are you? Is it you? Is it really you this time? People, for the love of God, take off your clothes!
