[Cheering] Yeah! Yeah! Oh, Yeah! Cool! Ew! Kids, Kids, Can I Have Your Attention, Please? I Have A Special Treat For You. Direct From Entertaining The Crowned Heads Of Europe, It's Oscar The Magic Clown! [Cheering] Presenting Me, Oscar, The Clown Of Renown, The Fabulous, The Fantastic, The Extraordinary! Yay! Yay! It's The Day Before Halloween, A Day Of Spells And Superstition, A Day Of Witches And Wizards! There's Magic In The Air. Wow! The First Thing That Oscar's Going To Do Is Judge The Pumpkin Carving Contest. I Know You've All Worked Hard On Your Pumpkins, So Let's Show Them Off, O.K.? Ha Ha! Oscar, This Is Eddie Lombardo. Hi, Eddie! And This Is Lisa Funai. This Is Charles Feffer. Smile, Charles! And These Are The Farmer Twins, Lynn And Kelly. That Was Terrific, Kids. They're All So Wonderful. It's Hard To Decide Who Will Win This Magic Wand. I Hope I Win It! I Hope I Win It! And The Winner Is... You Two! You Mean We Each Get A Magic Wand? I Only Have One. You'll Have To Share. Story Of Our Lives. I Get It First. You Always Go First. O.K. Just Don't Break It. Jacuzzi! Jacuzzi! Abracadabra! Whoa! Whoa! Hey, That Was Neat. How'd You Do That? I Didn't. He Didn't. What A Clown! Thanks For The Party. Don, I Know You Won't Like This Idea, But I Thought Of Somebody Else We Could Go To. Anybody. I'll Try Anybody. Aunt Agatha. Anybody But Her. We Have No Other Option. The Bank Said No. What's The Worst She Could Do, Turn Us Down? She Could Humiliate Us, Insult Us, Reject Us. It Could Get Ugly. We'll Stop On The Way Back. Please, Honey? Where Have You Been? My Girls Have Fun? Yeah! This Great Clown Made Balloon Animals. Mine's A Dog Or A Fish. Maybe Its A Dogfish. Look At This Magic Wand I Won. We Won. Thanks For Having The Party. Thanks For Coming. They Are So Cute. Must Be Murder Trying To Tell Them Apart. [Sarcastic Laughing] Are We Going To Go Home And Make Our Costumes? We're Making A Stop On The Way Home, Just To See Somebody. Just So We Don't Wear The Same Costumes. That Is So Dorky. I Don't Want To Look Like Kelly. I Don't Want To Look Like You, Either. Kelly, Lynn. Well, Here We Are. Ooh, What A Great House! Who Lives There? My Aunt Agatha. You Have An Aunt That Lives In A House Like That? You Never Told Us About Her. She's Not What You'd Call A Close Relative. Anything We Can Do To Change That? You Two Better Wait In The Car With Norman. Why Can't We Come? Well, She Doesn't Like Children. She Doesn't Like Children? She Doesn't Like Anybody. Come On. Get This Over With. You Two Be Good. [Doorbell Rings] [Pounding On Door] There's Someone At The Door, Madam. Duh! Should I Answer It, Madam? No. I'll Answer It. You Sit Here And Be Filthy Rich. [Meow] Abracadabra! Kelly, Wake Up! What? The Wand Just Flew Out Of My Hand. Sure. Come On. Yes? Aunt Agatha, It's Christine... Your Niece. I Know Who You Are. What Do You Want? Could We Talk To You For Just A Minute? If You Must. [Whimpering] [Whimpering] Aah! Aah! Aah! He Won't Hurt You. Who Said That? Me. Oh. Ahh. Yeah. That's Just Norman. He Wouldn't Hurt Anybody. But...You Were Over There. No. That Was Me. Aah! You're In Two Places At The Same Time! We're Twins, Silly. Ohh. Ohh! Ohh! Oh, Twins. Oh. Twins? Do You Drink Lots Of Coffee? You Might Want To Switch To Decaf. If You Had My Job, You'd Be Nervous, Too. What's Your Job? I'm A Gravedigger. That's Why I'm Digging A Grave. For Who? Shh! Shh! I'm Doing It For Very Little Money For...Her. It Doesn't Pay To Cross Her. Who Or What She Plans To Bury, I Don't Know. I Don't Want To Know. I Have To Hurry Home. I'm Not Leaving My House Again Until The Day After Halloween! How Come? Don't You Know What Happens On Halloween? Yeah. You Go Trick-Or-Treating. This Guy Needs To Get Out More. Halloween--Allhallows Eve. It's The Yearly Festival Of The Witches. They Cast Their Spells And Celebrate Their Dark Doings At A Gathering. Since The Time Of The Druids And Celts, It Has Been So. They Summon Ghosts And Goblins To Do Their Bidding, And The Dead Have Been Known To Rise From Their Graves. She'll Be At The Gathering, I Bet. What's A Gathering? It's A Get-Together, It's A Party, Kind Of, For Witches And Their Ilk. What's An Ilk? It's Kind Of Like Bullwinkle. No, Bullwinkle's Kind Of A Moose. Ilk Is Like Friends. But Witches Are Just Make-Believe. I Didn't Think They Really Existed. The Question Is Not Whether You Think Witches Exist But Whether The Witches Think That You Exist. Are You Saying Witches Are Real? Oh, Yeah. There Are Good Witches And Bad Witches. A Bad Witch Lived In That House 200 Years Ago, And A Bad One Lives There Now. Sit Down. Over There. I Knew That If I'd Called, You Wouldn't Have Wanted Us To Come. You're Right. Why Did You? Well, It's Been Seven Years Since I've Actually Seen You, Ever Since Aunt Sophia Left. It Must Have Been Upsetting When She Left. Upsetting? Ha Ha Ha! I'm Loving It. Good Riddance, I Say! I Have Never Understood How You Could Just Cut Off Contact With Everybody Like That. You've Never Even Met Our Girls. We're Family. Family? Family Is Just Strangers Who Happen To Be Related. I'm So Glad We Came. [Groaning] 200 Years Ago, The Townspeople Seized The Witch Who Lived There And Burned Her At The Stake. But She'd Hidden Her Moonstone, The Gem That Gave Her Her Powers. For Many Generations, No One Could Find It, And Then, 50 Years Ago On Halloween, Two Little Girls Just Like You Heard The Legend And Began To Look For The Moonstone. Two Girls Just Like Us? Yep. Twins, Just Like You-- Agatha And Sophia. I Win. Let's Look For The Moonstone. If We Find It, We'll Make A Wish. We'll Wish That We're Not Twins And That We're Completely Different. Splendid! You Look In The Basement. I'll Look In The Attic. [Door Creaking Loudly] Sophia! Sophia! Sophia! Sophia! Did You Find The Moonstone? I... No. I Didn't Find It. I've Been Thinking It Over. That's Just An Old Story. There's No Magic. But The Moonstone... It's Just Make-Believe. You Don't Believe In Magic, Do You? No, I Don't Believe In It. Didn't She Share The Moonstone With Her Sister? After That, She Never Shared Anything. Here. You Hold This For A While. She Learned More Spells And Used Them To Make Her Sister's Life Miserable, And Finally, She Used The Moonstone To Trap The Spirit Of Her Sister Inside That Very House, And There It Remains Trapped To This Day. Can't Somebody Do Something? Oh, The Spell Can Only Be Broken At Midnight On Halloween. How? Well, Someone Would Have To Rub The Moonstone And Say The Right Incantation-- What's An Incantation? It's Magic Words Like Abracadabra, Uh...Gizzorn And Platz. [Owl Hooting] Oh! I Shouldn't Even Speak Of Such Things. The Shadow World's All Around Us. I Could Be Carried To The Dark Side Of The Moon. You See, I Live Where The Sun Always Shines And It Never Gets Dark. Smart, Huh? Goodbye. Take Care And Beware. Aunt Agatha, I'm Going To Be Honest With You. Don's Construction Business Isn't Going Well. He's Good At It. I'll Bet. But With The Recession, A Lot Of People Haven't Paid What They Owe. So? So...We Need Your Help. The Bank Is Threatening To Foreclose On Our House. We're Asking For A Loan, Not A Gift. I Knew It! You Had A Selfish Reason To Come Crawling Around. It's Take, Take, Take! That's Not Fair! All We've Gotten From You Is Rejection And Abuse. If You Think That's Rejection And Abuse, You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet! I Took The Liberty Of Preparing Tea. Drop It! Now Take The Liberty Of Showing These Beggars The Door. They're Out Of Here. [Cat Screeches] Aah! My Cat! My Cat! Aah! [Dog Barking] Norman, Leave That Cat Alone. Norman, Get Out Of There. Kids, Get Away From That Cat. The Moonstone. Twins. You Never Said You Had Twins. When Did You Give Us The Chance? Get Off My Street Right Now! Don't Yell At My Daughters! Take That Mutt And Those Brats! I'm Warning You. Gladly. Girls, We're Going! Never Come Back! You Hear Me? Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty. Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty. [Growling] Let's Go, Let's Go. Come On. Come On. Where Are You? They've Come. I Knew They'd Come Someday. Don't Get Your Hopes Up, Goody-Two-Shoes. But-- No Buts. Tomorrow Night At Midnight, It'll Be Seven Years Since I Banished You. Oh! The Big Seven, And The Spell Becomes Permanent. I'm Going To Drip Bat's Blood And Sealing Wax On This Mirror And Bury It. I Have A Nice Grave All Ready. You Really Enjoy Being Evil, Don't You? It's The Best. Mom, When I'm Older, Can I Get A Nose Job? What's Wrong With Your Nose? Nothing, But Then We Won't Look Like Twins. Better Yet, Can Kelly Have A Nose Job? I Don't Want A Nose Job. I Want A Tattoo. What? Being Twins Is Special. Is There A Curse On That House? There's A Curse In That House. Why Do You Ask? Because The Gravedigger Said So. Gravediggers And Curses? Girls, Halloween Isn't Till Tomorrow Night. Is Aunt Agatha Really A Witch? You Bet She Is. She Is A Witch. Uh...Uh, Thanks, But, Um, Could You Not Do That, Please? I Don't Have Any Spare Change. I-I'll Take Plastic, Dollars, Lighters, Yen, Lira, Simoleons, Loonies. Be Sure To Brush Afterwards. Don't Forget To Floss. What's This? It's Pineapple! What Will I Do With Pineapple? I Hate Pineapple! If They Come Anywhere Near This House, I'll Take Care Of Them, Too. Aunt Agatha Had A Twin Sister... Sophia. She Was Never Nice To Her. Ow! Careful, Now. They're Hot. Mmm. Mmm. As Far Back As I Can Remember, Aunt Sophia Was Just So Kind And Generous, And I Really Miss Her, And These Cookies Are Her Recipe. Cinnamon--Her Favorite. We Always Baked Them Together. What Happened To Aunt Sophia? Well, About Seven Years Ago, Aunt Sophia Met A Nice Man, And They Got Engaged, And I Guess They Must Have Run Off Together. Didn't She Call Or Write? No. That Was The Strange Part. No One Ever Heard From Or Saw Her Again. [Doorbell Rings] I'll Get It. Your Dad's In The Back. She's Trapped In That Weird House. The Gravedigger Was Right. Bernard Brewster, Real-Estate Division, National General Bank. You Must Be Mrs. Farmer. So Glad To Meet You. What Can I Do For You? Since Foreclosure's Monday, I Thought I'd Take A Peek. This Must Be The Living Room. Bernard Brewster, Real-Estate Division, National General Bank. Did You Decorate Yourself? Nothing Paint Won't Fix. You Can't Come In! Did You Call? It'll Look Bigger When The Toys Are Cleared Out. What Do You Mean, Cleared Out? Hey, Aren't You Two Cute? Two...Cute. Ha Ha Ha! I Think I'm Seeing Double. That's It. Out. Hey, What's Your Problem? Out! Give Me A Break. The Bank Isn't Giving Me Breaks. Don't Come Back Without An Appointment. [Car Engine Starts] Family Conference Time. So, What All That Stuff Means Is...Because We've Had These Problems Making The Payments, The Bank Wants To Take Back The House And Sell It. Daddy Won't Let That Happen. Why Didn't You Tell Us? We're Supposed To Share Problems. Yeah, Everybody Says So-- Phil Donahue, Oprah... Sally Jessy, Larry King. They Get The Point. We Didn't Want You To Worry. We Were Hoping We'd Get The Money Soon. We Even Tried Asking Aunt Agatha For A Loan. If Only Aunt Sophia Were Here. We Don't Want To Leave. Where Will We Go? Hey! Hey! We'll Figure Something Out. We'll Improvise. I Don't Want You To Worry. We'll Be Fine. And Tomorrow, You'll Go Trick-Or-Treating With The Rest Of The Kids. And Monday, We'll Do The Best We Can. Remember That We're A Family. We'll Be Fine. We Love You. There's Nothing To Be Afraid Of. O.K.? We Love You, Too. Well, That's All That Matters. Good Night, Sweet Pea. Mm-Muh! Good Night, Baby. We Are So Lucky To Have Those Two. You're Telling Me. And I'm Telling You, Something's Going To Happen To Save This House. I'm Still Worried That Lynn Is Frustrated With Being A Twin. It's Making Her Bossy To Kelly. It's Starting Arguments Between Them. I'm Not Sure How To Handle It. Kids Always Fight A Little. As For This Twin Thing, They Just Want To Be Recognized As Individuals. That's Fair Enough. It's Hard For Twins, Though. Well, Kids Are Stronger Than We Think. They'll Get Over It. I Don't Know. Agatha Never Did. Hmm. Are You Asleep? Are You Nuts? We've Been In This House Since We Were Young. Norman's Been Here Since He Was A Puppy. I Wish Aunt Agatha Would Give Mom And Dad Money. If Aunt Sophia Were Free, She'd Help Mom And Dad. We Have To Get The Moonstone. And Free Aunt Sophia. Do YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC? Well, I'm Open To The Idea. If We Go To The Witches' Gathering, We Can Get The Moonstone. We Don't Know How To Get There. You Said You Believed In Magic. I'm Open To The Idea. I Didn't Say I'd Go To A Witches' Gathering. We'll Improvise. We Should Explain This To Mom And Dad. Oh, Yeah, Right. "I'll Let You Stay Up Until Midnight And Break The Spell." I Can Just Imagine Them Saying That. Maybe They Can Help Us Figure It Out. We'll Do This On Our Own. I Guess So. If We Disappear Like Aunt Sophia, I'll Sure Miss Norman. Norman, We're Going On A Scary And Dangerous Mission Tomorrow. If We Don't Come Back, Take Care Of Mom And Dad. Have You Finished The Task, But Not Before Telling Those Twins Something To Which They Shouldn't Be Privy? Don't Lie! Your Days, Pitiful And Pathetic As They Are, Shall Be Numbered. Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! If I Ever See Your Stupid, Shriveled Face Again, I'll Use It As An Oil Rag! George, Pour Me A Bath. Make It Good And Cold. Kids Don't Seem To Be As Upset Today As They Were Last Night. Kids Live In The Moment. That Sounds Good. Let's Forget Our Troubles, Too, And Just Enjoy Halloween. Mrs. Farmer, You Got Yourself A Deal. Now. O.K. Psst! Over Here. Hi. How Would You Like All Our Candy? Great. What's The Catch? Put On Our Costumes For A Little While. That's For Girls. I Don't Know. Check It Out. I Think We Better Ask Our Moms First. It's A Limited Time Offer. Take It Or Leave It. Do It! We'll Take It. Where Are The Girls? Have They Fallen Behind? Ladies! There They Are. Come On. This Is Pretty Cool! Where Do You Have A Witches' Gathering? Hollywood? Nah, Someplace Spooky. Maybe We Can Find Somebody Who Knows. I'll Toss A Penny. If It's Heads, We Keep Going In That Direction. Hey! You Could Kill Somebody Like That! Unless It Was A Silver Dollar, Then You'd Be Forgiven. Where's He Going? Under The Bridge. What Are You Doing Down There? This Is My... Humble Home. If You Had A Door, We Would Have Knocked First. If You're Homeless, There's A Place Downtown That Can Help You. I Saw It On The News. Who Are You Two, Dear Abby And Ann Landers? I Don't Want A Handout. I Want To Be Rich. No! Not Just Rich. I Want To Be... Filthy Rich! Ramone, Bring The Ferrari Around. I Think I'll Drive It Myself Today. Ho Ho Ho! Lots Of Money And Wonderful Things-- Planes And Houses, A House On The Islands. I Need...New Shoes. Yes! Yes! Wait A Minute. Blond. Two Young Blond-- Oh, Yes! I Think I Remember. Don't I Know You? You're The Windshield Guy. We Always See You On That Corner Over There. You're The Ones That Gave Me The Pineapple Lollipops. You...You Shouldn't Be Here Alone. What Are You Doing By Yourselves? You Should Go Home. Not Until We Get Aunt Agatha's Moonstone. And Break The Magic Spell On Aunt Sophia. Hold It. Time-Out. Un Momento, Por Favor. You Lost Me Back At The Part About The Moonstone. What Is A Moonstone? It's This Gem That She Has. Gem? Is It Valuable? Oh, Yes. 200 Years Old. Interesting. And You're Going To Get This Gem By Yourselves? Sure. Hmm... Two Little Girls Traveling With An Expensive Gemstone. Someone Might Try To Steal It. I'd Better Go Along And Protect You. It Could Come In Handy Having A Grownup Along. O.K., Mr... Plato Naufzagger. A Plate Of What? Just Call Me Mr. N For Short. I'm Kelly. I'm Lynn. Ha Ha Ha Ha! We Know Aunt Agatha's Going To A Witches' Gathering, But We Don't Know Where It Is. Do You Know Where It Could Be? She's In A Group. Halloween Brings Out The Loonies. Speaking Of Loonies, I Know The One Who Might Help Us. She's Not Far. When Will She Love Me? Any Day. Any Day Now. Uh...Madame Lulu. Next. Madame Lulu, Could I Have A Word With You? Don't Stand In The Way Of Paying Customers. Uh...Lulu, These Young Ladies Need Advice. Do You Have $5.00? Next. Lulu! Ha Ha Ha! How Would You Like For Me To Tell These Nice People That You're Not From Romania, But Brooklyn? I'll Tell These Girls The Closest You've Been To Buckingham Palace Is A Royal Flush. O.K., Make It Fast. Their Aunt Is Going To Some Sort Of Witches' Gathering Tonight. Since All These Loonies Come To You, You May Know Where They're Getting Together. I Have No Idea. Next! But Can't You Look Into Your Crystal Ball? What Are You, Nuts? What Are You, A Phony Baloney? All Right. All Right. Yes. The Vision Is Coming To Me Now. I See A Gathering High On A Mountaintop Where Owls Call. Hoo! Hoo! O.K.? Now Beat It. Can't You Be More Specific, Like How You Get There? For A $5.00 Iou, You Want A Map? What'd She Do To My Crystal Ball? What's Going On? I Recognize That Joint. The Gathering Must Be Down In The Old Abandoned Warehouse District. On Halloween? That's Pretty Good, Lulu. All This Time, I Thought You Were A Fake. Has She Been Doing This For Very Long? We Have A Long Way To Go, But Here's Our Bus. A Pumpkin Truck? Ha Ha! Keep A Lookout. Well, Here We Are. If There Were Any Justice, I Would Have A Limo And A Chauffeur. And A Bill You Couldn't Pay. Yes, Ladies, Money Is The Key, And I Want Lots Of It. Have You Ever Worked For It? Hey, There Are Limits. Besides Saving Your House And Finding Your Long-Lost Aunt, What Else Are You Going To Wish For? I Want To Be A Doctor. I Wanted To Be A Doctor First. We Can Both Be Doctors. Yes. I Would Like To Be A Doctor, Also. So You Can Save People's Lives? So I Can Pull Down 300 Grand A Year And Drive A Mercedes. Ha Ha Ha Ha! ? I Know A Song That Gets On Everybody's Nerves ? ? Everybody's Nerves ? ? I Know A Song That Gets On Everybody's Nerves ? ? Everybody's Nerves ? ? Everybody's Nerves ? ? I Know A Song That Gets On Everybody's Nerves ? ? And This Is How It Goes ? ? Boom Boom ?? Oh! Yeah-- He's Turned Off The Road We Need To Be On. You're Going The Wrong Way. We've Got To Get Off. Not Until He Stops. No Way. Oh! Way! Way! Excuse Me, Dude. Ooh! Ooh! [Screaming] [Humming] Hey! My Pumpkins! Run! Come Back Here! Quickly! Run! Let's Get Out Of Here! I'm With You! You Girls Are Fast. I Have Trouble Keeping Up With You. I Think We've Lost Him. And Us. I Feel Bad About That Poor Man And His Pumpkins. I Will Compensate Him At Our Earliest Possible Opportunity. Which Way Do We Go? Well, Uh... Hmm... We're Lost, Aren't We? Don't Be Silly. We're, Uh...Hmm... We Know Where We Are. We Just Don't Know Where Everything Else Is. Let's Try This Way. Did You Know That On Halloween Goblins Roam The Land? And Ghosts And Witches And Ilk? Oh, This Is Just Silly Superstition. Ha Ha Ha! [Owl Hoots] Aah! Don't Hurt Me! What Was That? I Think That Was Just An Owl. Oh! Of Course It Was. I Was Only Testing You. Maybe You Should Go Ahead And Make Sure Nothing's There. Me? You're The Adult. I Should Go Back To My Bridge. I Thought You Were Going To Help Us Get The Moonstone. About This Moonstone-- Now, Is This One Of Those... Teeny-Weeny, Little Gems? Humongous! Ha Ha Ha Ha! I Was Just Kidding! Of Course, I Would Never Leave You Two On Your Own. We're In Big Trouble. Look! There's A House! You See, I Knew That That House Was There. Give Me A Break. Looks Like A Really Little House. No, No, No, No. You See, It Only Looks Small Because It's So Far Off Into The Distance. It's Called The Perspective Effect. We Have Quite A Hike Ahead Of Us. I Guess It's Not The Perspective Effect After All. The Lights Are On. Somebody Must Be In There. Yeah. Somebody With A Heck Of A Backache. You're On Your Own. I Can't Fit In There. Hello? Hello? Hello? You Have To Call Louder Than That. You Do It. Hello? ? Ba Da Pa Ba Do Ba Da ? ? Do Da Do Da Da ? ? Ba De Da Da ? ? Ba Be Do Ba Ba Da ? ? Ba Ba Ba-- ?? What Are You Doing Here? Mr. N Was Showing Us The Shortcut, And We Saw Your House. We Knocked, But You Didn't Answer. One Thing At A Time. Who's Mr. N? Our Friend. That's Him At The Window. How Do You Do? You Have A Very Nice Place Here. Aren't You Oscar The Clown? Yes. I Remember You Two. You Seem Mad. I'm Not Mad. It's Just-- Well... I Usually Don't Let Anybody See Me Out Of My Clown Outfit. People Laugh With Me When I'm A Clown. Ta-Da! Oscar, The Clown Of Renown, The Fabulous, The Fantastic, The Extraordinary! [Honking] But...When I'm Just A Little Person, Sometimes People Laugh At Me. So...I Stay Here... Alone... In Front Of My Mirror, And I Pretend That I Really Am... Fabulous, Fantastic, Extraordinary. Oscar, We Would Never Make Fun Of You. We're Little Ourselves. So You Are. And You Still Have The Wand. Anything Strange Happen To You Today? Being Here Is The Strangest Part So Far. Oscar, Could You Help Us Get To The Edge Of Town? How Come? We Better Tell Him The Whole Story. No. Not The Whole Story. They're Enjoying Themselves. They're Acting Like They Don't Have A Care. And So, We Have To Break The Magic Spell By Midnight. This Could Be A Fantastic Adventure, Not Without Risk, Of Course. But What Great Adventure Isn't? We Have No Time To Lose. Ladies, I Find Parts Of That Story Rather Hard To Believe. The Problem Is That As People Get Bigger, Their Imaginations Get Smaller. You'll Take Us To The Gathering? Of Course I Will! We Have To Be Prepared. They're Coming To The Gathering. Wonderful! Soon I'll Have Those Two Little Girls Right Where I Want Them. Ha Ha Ha Ha! Ha Ha Ha! Ta-Da! The Oscarmobile! Wait! Wait! What About Me? Hang On Tight! Oh! Ha Ha Ha Ha! Hee Hee Hee Hee! I Love Halloween. Step On It. We're Already Exceeding The Speed Limit. Silence! I Want You To Drive Faster. I Assume I Should Pause At Red Lights. Do I Pay You To Assume? No, Madam. You Pay Me Nothing. You Get What You Pay For. Shut Up And Drive! I'll Worry About The Red Lights. Come On. Hurry With Your Make-Up. They've Got Enough Candy To Last Them A Decade Or Two. I Think So. Let's Go Home. It Was A Battle Getting Them Home Last Year. Lynn, Kelly, Come On! Daddy's Turning Into A Pumpkin. Come On. Let's Go Home. We Won't Go Home With You. We Want To Go To Our Own Homes. They Didn't Say Why. They Just Wanted To Do It. They Didn't Say Where They Were Going? No. Let's Go To The Police. You Read My Mind. Thanks. I'll Bet This Is Just A Halloween Trick. I'm Sure Your Twins Are Safe And Sound, Having A Great Time With Friends. This Is The Place. Come On! Your Turn. Come On! How Are We Going To Get Past This Guy? I'll Do The Talking. Invitations, Please. Uh, This Is My Covenant. I Had Our Invitation. My Black Cat Ate It. You Have A Problem With That? No. ? Ah Ah Ahh Ah ? ? Ah Ah Ah Ahh Ah Ah ? ? Ah Ah Ah Ah Ahh Ah ? ? Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah ? They've Been Reading Too Much Stephen King. You See Aunt Agatha? No, But This Is Definitely Her Ilk. ? Ah Ah Ah Ah Ahh Ah ? ? Ahh ?? [Applause] She's The Elizabeth Taylor Of The Weirdoes. What If She Sees Us? We're History. Pull Down Your Hood, And She Won't. I Always Put In Eye Of Newt, Toe Of Frog, Wool Of Bat, And...Tongue Of Dog. Yuck! Yuck! Do You Use A Microwave? No. It Just Doesn't Brown The Same. Agatha, Will You Lead Us In The Invocation? Oh, Certainly. ? Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm ? ? Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah ?? Fair Is Foul, And Foul Is Fair. Hover Through The Filthy Air. Double, Double, Toil And Trouble, Fire Burn, Cauldron Bubble! Moving. Thank You. First Of All, Our Thanks To Our Glee Club. A-One, A-Two, A-Three. Ah! Ah! Ah! We'll Have Our Cassettes On Sale On The Way Out. I Can't Wait To Get One Of Those. Your Membership Dues Were Supposed To Be Paid. Some Of You Haven't Paid Them Yet. You Know Who You Are. If You Don't Pay Tonight, It Could Be Toadtime. Also, The Caretaker Tells Us There Are Some People Living In This Neighborhood, So Later, When We Cast Our Spells, He Asks That We Keep Our Moaning And Shrieking Down To A Reasonable Level. And I'm Sorry To Tell You That Our Truckload Of Pumpkins Didn't Show Up. Mr. Gonzales, Who Has Always Been Very Dependable, Called To Say He Was Waylaid By A Ruffian. Those Pumpkins. And Finally, I Know We'll All Wish To Extend Our Congratulations To Fred And Marcia. Where Are You? Who Have A New Addition To Their Household! What Is It, Fred? It's A Goblin. [Grunting And Squealing] Aw. Aw, The Patter Of Little Hooves. Remember How Fairy Tales Used To Keep Me Awake? If We Get Out Of This, I'll Be Awake Until I'm 21. All Right, So Much For Old Business! Now, Who Has New Business? Oh, I Do. I Do. My Colleagues, Gatherers, Comrades... Count? Um, Before I Begin Our Convolution And The Cry Of Curses, Let Me First Mention An Emergency That I See As A Juicy Challenge For The Entire Group, One That I Think You Will Enjoy Helping Me To Solve. Seven Years Ago, I Cast A Powerful Spell, A Spell That Banished My Sweet, Namby-Pamby Twin Sister To A Life Of Lonely Isolation On The Other Side Of A Mirror. [Applause] Naughty Me. She's Good. She Is Very Good. Oscar, Let's Go. I Have An Idea. The Spell Becomes Permanent... Come On. Follow Me. There Are Those Who Would Interfere With My Spell, Who Seek To Undo All My Bad Work. The Ones Who Resist Me Are Very Young. Kids These Days Have No Respect. Children Are Sick! The Ones Who Resist Me Are Sisters--Twins. Why Have I Asked For Help? Why? Why? Why? The Twins Are Among Us! I'd Like To Get My Hands On Those Twins. Those Little Brats! I Have The Answer. I've Not Seen You Before. Who Are You? I Am Brother Grimsby. I Come To This Gathering From Far, Far Away, From The Land Of The Adder's Fork And The Blind Bird's Sting, From The Lizard's Leg And The Hornet's Wing. I Come From A Land Where-- All Right! All Right! What's Your Suggestion? I Have A Spell That Will Double The Power Of Your Moonstone, But You Must Put It In My Hand. How Do You Know About My Moonstone? I Know All. I See All. Would You Not Like Me To Double Your Power... At No Cost To You, Of Course? Or Do You Doubt My Power? Now That You Mention It, Yes. Very Well. I Will Let The Cauldron Speak. O Great Receptacle Of Smoke And Spirit, Do You Verify My Power? Well? Good Stuff. Do You Accept My Offer? It Will Double Your Power. Double My Power? Yes. All Right. I Accept Your Offer. And What About The Twins? The New And Improved Moonstone Will Point Them Out To Us, And We Can All Deal With Them. I Like The Way You Think! My Incantation To The Forces Of Evil. O Forces Of Evil... ? Oh Ee Oh Ah Ah ? ? Ting Tang ? ? Walla Walla Bing Bang ?? Aah! Trickery! Skullduggery! Oh, Stop Them And Find Those Twins! There They Are! I've Been Hoodwinked! Trickery! Run! Look! There They Are! I Hate This! You Didn't Want To Tell Mom And Dad! Seize Them! [Oscar] Hurry! They're Right Behind Us! [Agatha] Seize Them! Seize Those Twins! Seize Them! They're Over Here! This Way! They Can't Have Gotten Very Far! I Got It! Who Wants To Keep It? I Will. Why You? I'm The Biggest. You Might Run Off. Oscar, No Trust-- That Is What Is Wrong With The World Today. How Do We Know That You Won't Run Off? Cut It Out. They're Coming. I'll Take It. What Will We Do? Split Up. We Should Stay Together. It's The Only Chance Of Escaping. We'll Go This Way. You Go That Way. Sure. You Go With The Moonstone. [Agatha] Over This Way! By The Cars! We Meet Up Again At The Oscarmobile. Come On! Good Luck, Kelly. Good Luck, Lynn. Touching, But Could We Get A Move On? Go! Drat! Drat! If We Don't Find Them, I'm Taking It Out On You! There They Go! After Them! Follow Them! Head Them Off And Bring Them Back For Their Punishment! Hey, Wait For Me! I'm In Heels, You Know. Look, Folks, It's Halloween. Kids Play Tricks And Pranks. But They're Only 7. I'll Put Out A Code, All Units. One Of You Go Home, Call Their Friends, And See If They Haven't Just Gone Visiting. Retrace Their Trick-Or-Treating Route And Ask If Anybody's Seen Them. What About A Missing Person's Report? They've Been Gone Two Hours. They Ran Off Deliberately. Make Those Calls And Get Back To Me. All Right. Thank You. I Overheard. It's Probably All Very Innocent. I'm Heading Back Out. I'll Make A Few Inquiries. Thank You. We'd Appreciate That. I Got Two Of My Own. It's Not Like Them. Neither Would Run Away. Up There! Up There! What If It's A Dead End? It's Not. Trust Me. It's A Dead End. Read The Sign. [Agatha] You've Run Into A Dead End! This Way! How Convenient! Ha Ha Ha Ha! Hurry! Hurry! Good. We'll Be Safe In Here... Wherever We Are. You're Trapped In There! She Doesn't Know Where We Are. We're Watching The Stairway, And We're Watching The Elevator! Give Yourselves Up Now! I Have A Plan! This Ought To Be Good. Do You Want To Hear It? Yes. I'll Go Down And Tell Her That We Haven't Got The Moonstone, That Lynn And Oscar Have It. They'll Throw It Off A Bridge So It Can't Do Harm. She Still Won't Let Us Go. But You're Not Reckoning With The Persuasive Charms Of The Silver-Tongued Mr. N. You've Decided To Give Yourself Up? Where's The Brat? I'm Not Giving Up. I Am Negotiating. What Are You Talking About? Here's The Deal, Toots. Now, You Want The Moonstone Back, Right? It Is Mine! Fine. Kelly And I Don't Have It. Lynn And Oscar Have It. But...If You Give Me A Large Reward And Promise Not To Hurt The Girls, I Will Help You Get The Moonstone Back. That Will Keep Them From Lifting The Spell On Aunt Sophia. How Does $50,000 Sound? I Don't Need You. You're Nothing But A Duplicitous Twerp, A Vituperative Snark! I'm Sorry You Feel That Way. You Drive A Hard Bargain. I Respect That. 25,000 And Not A Penny Less! You're Starting To Irritate Me. $10,000, And That Is My Final Offer! Why Don't I Give You My Final Offer? I'm All Ears. [Caw Caw] No! I'm All Feathers! [Caw Caw] Lady, I Would Have Settled For 20 Bucks! Find A Flock And Get Lost! You're Crazy, Lady! Mr. N! Mr. N! Are You All Right? Your Sister Has Saved Me! What Happened? Oh, Lynn And Oscar Came To The House And Used The Moonstone To Free Me! Where's Mr. N? Mister-- Oh! Oh, Your Friend. Oh! Well, He Was So Glad That This Was All Over That He Flew-- He Fled. He Rushed Off. And Where's Lynn And Oscar? Oh, Everybody's All Safe And Sound. Let's Hurry. I've Decided To Give Your Parents The Loan. You Won't Lose The House. You'll Be Part Of Our Family! Nothing Could Make Me Happier. Come On Down. Hurry Up. And Then You And Mom And Lynn And Me Can All Bake Your Favorite Cookies! Yes! That's Right! Oh! Because Mom Told Me How Much You Love Chocolate Chip Cookies. My Favorite! Are You Coming Down? I'm Scared! It's Dark! Then I'll Come Up. Could You? No Problem. And I'll Open The Door. I'm On My Way. Here I Come. I Can Hardly Wait. Me, Neither. What? What Are You-- What's Going-- Wh-What's Happening? You're Not Aunt Sophia. Her Favorite Cookies Were Cinnamon, Not Chocolate Chip! I Don't Care If It's Fudge And Fly Droppings! Let Me Out Of This! What's Happened To My Magic? Mr. N! Mr. N! Uh-Oh. Mr. N, Mr. N, Guess What! I Trapped Aunt Agatha! Aah! The Coast Is Clear. Come On! Where's Mr. N And Kelly? Look Here! It's One Of Agatha's Minions! Chill, Man. It's Me. This Is Not A Trick. Mr. N? Yeah! Can You Get This? I've Been Dissed Big-Time! What Happened? Did Aunt Agatha Do This? Even Without The Moonstone, That Old Witch Has Got A Mess Of Magic. Talk About Sick. I'm Hungry. Anybody Got A Worm? Where's Kelly? Did She Get Away? No. They Grabbed Her, And They're Taking Her Back To Agatha's House. They'll Be Delayed A Little. I Don't Want Them To Hurt Her! Now, Now. I Haven't Been Nice To Kelly Lately. We've Never Been Apart. I Bet She's Scared. I'm Not There To Tell Her It's O.K. Come On. We Got To Be Brave. We Don't Know How To Get To Aunt Agatha's. We Can't Free Aunt Sophia, And We Can't Help Kelly. You Can't Give Up! That's Right. Look. We Still Have A Half Hour Till Midnight. That's It! Mr. Gravedigger! He'll Know How To Get There! But Where Is He? He Said He Lived Where The Sun Always Shines! I Could Fly To Vegas, Place Some Bets, Catch Siegfried & Roy. You Mean The Gravedigger Lives In Las Vegas? No. I Think He Lives There! Not In The Dark. No, Sir. Not On Halloween. No, Sir. Not So Close To Midnight! But You Have To Take Us. There's No Telling What Terrible Things Might Happen If You Try To Break That Spell. I'm Staying Here Where It's Nice And Bright. Oscar, Why Don't You Stay Here For A Minute? I Don't Think You Should Go Outside-- O...K. Good Idea. Look, Mr. Gravedigger, You Have To Help Us And Fast. You Said The Spell Has To Be Broken By Midnight. Did I Say That? You Can Do It Anytime, Anytime At All. Wait Till Next Summer. Ah! That's Never Happened Before! I--I Don't Like The Dark. The Lights Went Out. Well, I Guess It's Time To Go And Leave Mr. Gravedigger All Alone In The Dark. Oh, No, No, No, No. No. Don't Go. I Don't Like The Dark. We'll Keep You Company. Oh! Oh, Thank You. On The Way To Aunt Agatha's. What's Shaking, Man? Aah! Oh! Oh, No, You Don't. How Do You Do? Plato Naufzagger. Stay Cool. I'm Not Really A Bird. Nice Place You've Got Here. A Talking Crow? Car 249, We Have A Code 13 On The Corner Of Blake And Washington. This Is 249. I'm On My Way. Over. [Mr. N] Oscar, Go Faster. I Should Fly. Looks Like It Was Punctured By A... Crow's Beak. Oh! Stand Back! Oh, What A Phony-- You Turned That Man Into A Crow, Madam. That Was Easy. He Was Crooked. Without The Moonstone, This Requires Muscles I Haven't Used In Years. Air In Space... Up From The Ground, Make This Tire Nice And Round. Power Of Edsel, Spirit Of Corvair, Give Us Lots And Lots Of Air! [Air Hissing] Good. That's Good. No. That's Good. [Tire Explodes] Not Good! Ah! Don't Stand There Like An Idiot! Get The Jack! Argh! This Is It. This Is The Place! Let Me Off Here. Sit Down! You're Rocking The Boat. I Guess Since She's My Aunt, I Should Go First? Yeah. It's Locked. Let's Go Around Back. Let's Go Bowling. O.K., O.K., O.K. It's Locked. She May Be Mean, But She Ain't Stupid. We Can't Give Up. I Have An Idea. Come On. There's Only One Way To Get In. You Mean That Open Window? You've Got It. How Do We Get Up There? To The Oscarmobile! Faster! Faster! We're Almost There. When I've Thrown You Into The Mirror, Too, You'll Never See Your Parents Again Or That Mangy Mutt Of Yours! You Are So Cranky! Get A Life. Hurry, Hurry, Hurry, Hurry! Hurry! Hurry, Hurry, Hurry! That'll Be Enough. Come On. Hurry, Hurry, Hurry, Hurry. [Shouting] Whoa! Ohh... [Thunder] It's A Bird! It's A Bunch Of Balloons! Hey, It's You, Oscar. What Took You So Long? Hey, Where You Going? [Balloons Popping] [Caw Caw] Aw! Good Flying! I'll Unlock The Side Door. O.K. You're A Lot Of Help. Oh, No. Something's Happened. I Spotted A Girl Who Might Match Your Description In A Weird Vehicle Near The Corner Of Blackstone And Barnum. Do Your Girls Know Anybody Who Lives In That Area, Any Friends Or Relatives? Aunt Agatha. We'll Check This Out Right Away. Thanks. They Were In A Strange Vehicle. There Was A Crow And A Little Person In A Circus Car. She Said She Was Trapped In A Mirror. Spread Out! [Chiming] Help Me! Aunt Sophia? Aunt Sophia. Help Me! Aunt Sophia. Help Me! Aunt Sophia. I'm In The Attic! [Creak] I'm In The Attic! Quick! Up Here! Aunt Agatha Yelled At The Girls, But You Don't Think She'd Hurt Them, Do You? Of Course Not. [Caw] Oscar, You're So Slow! Keep Working On It, Oscar. I Have To Do Something. Where You Going? She Wouldn't Do Anything Really Bad To A Couple Of Kids. I'll Boil The Two Of You In Oil Before I Banish You Forever. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! Faster! Got It. There's The Mirror! There! I Knew You'd Come To Save Me. Do You Have The Moonstone? Yes. Wonderful! Ah! Oh! Where's Your Sister? She's Not Here. Then All Is Lost. The Incantation Must Be Spoken By Both Twins. It's The Curse Of The Twins That Trapped Me Here. What Do You Mean? As Time Went By, Agatha And I Hated Being Twins. We Became Jealous Of Each Other. And Then I... I Met George. [Footsteps] What Have You Done With Your Hair? I'd Ask You To Join Me, But I Prefer My Own Company. Like Always. George And I... Have Come To Say Goodbye. What Do You Mean, "Goodbye"? We're Going To Get Married And Move Away, Far Away. Is This Some Kind Of Joke? The Joke, I'm Afraid, May Be On You, Agatha. I Want A Life Of Kindness And Care... And Love. Oh, Don't Make Me Heave. You're Not Going Anywhere. Nobody Loves You. Wrong. I Do. Oh! Romeo Squeaks Up. Who Gave You Permission To Have Someone Fall In Love With You? Just Because You Won't Let Anybody Love You Doesn't Mean I Need Your Permission. Turkey Bbs. Say Goodbye To George. I'm Going. Farewell. I Warned You. You And Your Spells And Your Witchcraft. You And Your Love. Into The Mirror! Into The Void! You've Stirred Up My Ire. You've Made Me Annoyed. Annis... Sonannis... Dole Don Rackier. Enter The Shadows... Forever Be There. Sit Down, George. I'll Be Finished In A While, And Then You Can Wash The Dishes. Sit Down, Stupid! I Don't Suppose You'd Care For Some Rat Skull Curry? And That's When She Trapped You In The Mirror? Yes... And Put A Spell On George. [Caw] Ah! Car Coming. [Tires Squealing] [Oscar] It's Her! She's Here! Hang On To The Moonstone. She Can't Grab It From You. She Can Only Get It If You Give It To Her. It'll Be Safe With You. [Agatha] They're Here! Ahh... I Have Lynn! I'm Kelly! Oh, Whoever. I Have Your Sister! If You Care About Her, Give Yourself Up! Don't Do It! Gag Her With A Rune! [Caw] What A Witch! Be Careful, Lynn. You're Wearing My Moonstone. Give It To Me. I'll Turn You Into A Snail. Not. You Can't Hurt Me As Long As I'm Wearing The Moonstone. Sophia's Been Blabbing, Has She? Look, Dear, You And I Don't Have To Be Enemies, Do We? No, We Don't, If You Let Kelly Go And Aunt Sophia. I Have A Better Idea. You're Different From Your Sister. You're Special. What Do You Mean? You're Tired Of Being A Twin, Aren't You? Yeah, But... I Know What That's Like-- Having To Share Everything Or Having People Get You Mixed Up Together. Well... You And I Could Possess The Moonstone Together. But What About Kelly? She's In The Way. We'll Put Her With Aunt Sophia, And Then You Won't Be A Twin Anymore! Ha Ha Ha! No! That's Telling Her. Yeah! I Tried To Be Nice! That'll Be The Day. George, Didn't I Try To Be Nice? But No More Mr. Nice Guy. I Can't Cast A Spell On You, But Your Sister Isn't Wearing The Moonstone. Don't Turn Her Into Anything. Don't Hurt Her! I'll Offer You A Straight Exchange. If You Give Me The Moonstone, And I'll Let Both Of You Go. She's A Liar! George, Bring Kelly Closer So I Can Start Saying A Spell. No! I'll Do It. You Have To Promise To Let Everyone Go. Me, Too! And Turn Mr. N Back Into A Person. Well, All Right. I Promise. Cross Your Heart. Cross My Heart. Hope To Die. Hope To Die. Stick A Needle In Your Eye. Shake Your Bottom If You Got 'Em. Stick A Needle In Your Bottom-- Hand It Over! First, Let Kelly Go. First, Hand It Over. You Go First. You Go First. You Go First. Oh, For Goodness' Sake! Just Put The Moonstone Down Here On The Floor. George, When The Moonstone Is On The Floor, Let That Kelly Girl Go. Then I'll Turn Back Mr. N. Don't Do It! Run! Save Yourself! I Can't Let Her Hurt You. Little Sucker Actually Believed Me! Ha Ha Ha Ha! Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee! But You Crossed Your Heart. That Doesn't Count. I Don't Have A Heart. Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee! Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! [Mr. N] But I Do! Moonstone Coming Up. Good Job. Stop Them! Come Back, You Little Pip-Squeaks! Come Back Here! Do You Hear Me? Come Back Here! Come Back Here! I'm Waiting For You! Remember Before You Offered To Give Me Back The Moonstone For $50,000? Well, It's A Deal. I'll Turn You Back And Give You The Money. I Knew He Couldn't Be Trusted. It Was A Mistake. No Deal! I'm Ashamed Of Myself For Even Thinking About Betraying Lynn And Kelly, And Sticking Up For Them Is More Important Than Money. You're Turning Me Down? Even If It Means Being A Crow For The Rest Of Your Life? Even If It Means Being A Crow For Life. Go Get Your Shotgun, George. We're Going Crow Hunting. Hunt This, Ugly! Out Of My Way! I'm Not Afraid Of You. I Suppose You're Not Afraid Of Me, Either. I'm P-P-Petrified, But I'm Staying Here Anyway. Me, Too! I Guess Being Brave Isn't About Not Being Scared. It's About Being Scared, But Doing What You Have To. Isn't That Nice? He Found The Moral Of The Story. Out Of My Way! Ow! Oh, Oh... Ohh... Ohh... Aah... Aah... Ha Ha Ha! After Her! Hurry! Which Way Is South? Where You Goin'? I Want To Go Home. Broken Fan Belt. It's A Few Blocks Away. Come On! Aunt Sophia, What Do We Do? You Don't Have The Moonstone. That's Right! You Don't Have The Moonstone! And It's... One Minute To Midnight! George, Come Up Here And Force This Door Open! Ha Ha Ha! You Go First. I'll Go Up Your Back. O.K., I'll Try, But It's Pretty High Up. [Tapping] Hurry! Open The Window! Use The Wand. [Clock Dongs] It's Midnight. Good Luck. [Dong] Hurry. [Dong] When The Clock Finishes Striking Midnight, You're Out Of Time! What's The Incantation? What Do We Say? I Can't Tell You. It Has To Come From Your Heart. [Dong] We're Too Late! It's Soup City Now! [Dong] Midnight! [Dong] The Spell Is Permanent! You Have Failed! Abracadabra. Jacuzzi, Jacuzzi. Ooh Ee Ooh Ah Ah! You're Wasting Your Time. It's After Midnight. Even If You Knew The Incantation, It Wouldn't Do Any Good. It's After Midnight. Oh, Never Mind, Girls. You Tried. Trying Doesn't Bring Home The Bat Wings. Remember My Cat? Yes. I've Decided To Turn You Both Into A Mouse And Sic My Cat On You! Won't That Be Amusing? No! No Sense Of Humor? Thanks For Trying To Save My Life. I Love You. I Love You. You Know What? I Don't Really Mind Being Twins. Me, Neither. It Makes Us Special. I Don't Care If People Joke About Us Or If Mom Dresses Us Alike. I'll Always Want To Be Your Twin Sister. I'll Always Want To Be Your Twin Sister, Too. [Caw Caw] No! Please, Help The Bird! Help The Bird! Look Out! [Caw Caw] I'm A Bird! Caw! Caw! Here. Thanks. Aunt Sophia! Aunt Sophia! I'm Back! Oh! Oh! How Can This Be? It's After Midnight. It's Not. I Pushed The Clock Ahead By Five Minutes. You Sneaky, Despicable... Underhanded... No Sense Of Humor? Your Witching Days Are Over. Where Am I? If It's Not Midnight Yet, There's Still Time! Hurry, Don! Come On! Look In The House! George, Help Me! Let Go Of Her! We'll Hold On To You! In The Attic. Ah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! I'm Falling! Lynn? Kelly? [Arf] Are You Here? Up In The Attic. Oh, Please! [Arf] Are You All Right? I'm All Right. [Christine] We Were So Worried! Aunt Sophia! Is That Really, Really You? Yes, It's Really, Really Me! Can Someone Please Tell Me What's Been Going On? We--We've Been Having A Halloween Party, And W-We've Been Very Naughty Not To Call You And Tell You The Twins Were Here, Right, Girls? Yes. I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry. Where's Aunt Agatha? Well, She Decided To Go On A Long Journey. She Felt She Needed Time To... Reflect. And You're George, Aren't You? Yes. The Last Thing I Remember Was Sophia And Me Saying Goodbye To Agatha. Yes, Darling. We've All Said Goodbye To Her Now. Oh, George! Oh, Mmm! Don't Take Too Long, O.K.? We'll Be Right There. Mr. Gravedigger, We Are Very Proud How You Stood Up To You-Know-Who. Oh, Thank You! I Was Proud Of Me, Too. Oscar, You Were Very Fabulous Tonight. I Was, Wasn't I? I Think We Were All Pretty Fabulous, Fantastic, And Extraordinary. Mr. N, We Couldn't Have Done It Without You. We Wish We Can Give You A Million-Dollar Reward. Hey, I've Learned That Money Is Money, But Friends... Good Friends Are The Riches Of A Lifetime. Oh, My Girls! Mmm! From Now On, I Want This To Be A Second Home For All Of Us. We're Family Now. [Arf] Sophia... I Want You To Know That Through It All, Even When Agatha Was Up In The Attic During One Of Her Spells And I Had To Ask Which Witch Is Which And I Didn't Know Who I Was, I Felt Deep Down An Undeniable Love For You. That's So Dear. I Never Gave Up Hope That We'd Find Each Other Again. I Want You To Take A Big Batch Of These Cinnamon Cookies Home. I'm Looking Forward To Tasting Them Again. It Seems A Long Time Since You Made Them. Don, I Understand You Might Need Some Help With Your House Payment? Uh, Well-- Till Your Business Picks Up. Frankly, Yes. We're About To Lose The House. We Can't Let That Happen. We're Family. It Would Just Be A Loan. We'll Pay You Interest. As You Wish. [Christine] Perfection. You'd Better Call The Children. Girls! The Cookies Are Ready! Cookies! Coming! Help Me! I Know You'll Help Me. No Chance. No Chance. I Hate Halloween! Captioning Made Possible By Warner Bros. Captioning Performed By The National Captioning Institute, Inc.
