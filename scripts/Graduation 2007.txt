I probably would have gone, except for one thing... The police had us surrounded. # let's go # # I wanna take you for a ride... # I want... to get into Harvard. Okay, I want a date to prom. But she's gotta like Iggy, yeah, and have long legs and-- oh, shit! I want... a 10-inch penis. Whoo-hoo! I want... Get out. Oh, hey, this isn't the last one before graduation, right? No. No, dude, we definitely got time. -Bye. - Don't work too late, Carl. Good night, Jackson. Hey. - Sleep tight. - I would sleep so much tighter If I had something to hold on to. - Hold on to this. - Hey hey! - Bye. - Bye. Hey, mama. - Hey hey, Polly. - Hey. Going back to work? Yeah yeah, I gotta crunch some numbers with Barbara. This new loan program's a mess. - You hear anything? - I'm not getting in. - Go to work, please. - Okay, all right. Come in through the front. Your mom's gonna go nuts If she sees you all wet like that. The cheetah has accelerated from a standstill... - How you feeling, ma? - Hey. The dry scrub brush of the African plain Provides a perfect launching pad... Legs again, huh? It's nothing. So you think he'll be awake? Carl? No way. Carl! Carl! Get up, man. Ow! Ow! Carl needs sleep. No. Carl needs coffee. Mm-hmm, Carl needs coffee. - Better? - Oh yes. Thanks, hon. - Hello. - Good morning, sleepyhead. Oh, Jesus, I knew you were in here. I could smell you from all the way down the hall. - Ha ha ha. - Hey, who needs a bowl? - Hey, I'll take care of that. No no no, not so fast, you flash, you. - Yep, we're making breakfast. - It's all us. Do you want the Cap'n or cornflakes? Since you're asking, both. Thank you. Hey, Mare, guess what. Me and Polly got our dorm assignments for state. - We're in the same one. - Oooh! - They let you in? - Hey, eat me. Come on, boys. Is she not the cutest girl in the world? What about you, Jackson? Surely you've heard from a few schools by now. I didn't have the scores, Mrs. J. You don't do something with yourself, you're gonna have to answer to me. whoa! Good morning. Hey, Dad! Hi, Dad. - You know what I mean. - Watch out, Chauncey! Wow, man, You really suck at driving, don't you? Excuse me. Two weeks to graduation means two weeks to my final. Earth to Mr. Boyd. Can you name me two families in the Basidiomycota Phylum? Mr. Jackson, can you help Mr. Boyd? No, sir. Why should we care about fungi at all? Yes, Polly. - Without it, we wouldn't have penicillin. - Yeah, or beer. Precisely, Mr. Boyd. Carl. - Yeah. - Come on. Hey, you thought any more about your speech you're gonna give? - I'm not valedictorian. - Maybe it's a matter of time. Just do me a favor: When you do give a speech, don't talk about the journey or the future being wide open. Or how we're all the leaders of tomorrow. - Diamonds in the rough. - Raw clay. - I hate raw clay. That's so dumb. - Okay, I get the idea. This is so stupid. - Hey! - Hey! Hey, it's late. What are you doing here? I told your mom I had to drop off Some homework. She's still home. She's downstairs. Yeah, I know. It's never stopped us before. Oh, my god! - Come here. - No no no. I just-- I-- I-- okay. No, I-- I just don't feel like it, okay? What's wrong? I got into Harvard. Oh my god. It's amazing. I mean-- It's not S.U. No no, I know it's not, but-- Okay-- There's still Thanksgiving And winter break And spring break And summer. We can make it work, you know? - You really think so? - Mm-hmm. - I'm proud of you. - Mom! What are you doing home? I got drunk last night celebrating the day your mom left us For the carpet salesman. Company shipped without me. After last night, I gotta drive 15 in a row just to make the mortgage. And that means missing graduation. I'm sorry as hell. I don't even know if I'm going. - Hey, mike. - Yeah. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. When did you know that you wanted to be a truck driver? I didn't. You ready for this? I wanted to dance. What do you wanna be? I don't know. "Your account has exceeded its maximum annual... reimbursement. We regret to..." Whoa, Mom. Mom, Mom! - Carl, it hurts! - Mom Mom Mom! Your mother's got a lot of fans here pulling for her, - But I have to be honest. - Don't. There is one alternative with this kind of cancer-- - A bone marrow transplant. - Okay, let's do it. The hospital received a call from your insurance carrier yesterday. You're not even covered for this visit. Okay. How much for everything? $100,000. I can sell my car. That's nice. Would you really sell your car? Yeah, I mean, your mom taught me how to drive. Excuse me. Come on. My dad will loan you the money easy. - You just gotta ask him. - Yeah, I know. No, I'm sorry, Carl. There's-- There's absolutely nothing the bank can do. - Hey, Polly. - Hey, where were you? You missed dinner. - What's the matter? - Where's Dad? Where do you think? Dad! Hey, how's my little Harvard girl? Why is the alarm on? Well, Mom made me promise to keep it on. Why, is everything okay? If Mrs. J doesn't get this money, Dad-- Honey, honey, there's no way That Carl could repay that loan, which makes it a gift. And it's not my money to give. Yeah, but it's insured, Dad. Come on, can't you just do it this once? The FDIC covers the bank in case it's robbed or burns down, not if I start giving money away. You know that, sweetie. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. Oh, honey. Is everything all right, Mr. Deeley? - Yeah. - Hey, Polly. - Hi. - Congratulations. Your dad told me-- - Harvard. - Thanks, Barbara. It's funny seeing you here at this hour. Funny, yeah. Um, I-- I should get going. Since the auditorium asbestos clean up Has gone slower than expected, We're going to cut today's rehearsal short. Just a reminder: Graduation will be next Monday, 9:00 A.M. Sharp. Be sure your parents are in their seats 15 minutes early. I have a way to help your mom. Graduation is at 9:00 on Monday, right? My dad's vault is time-locked to open every Monday morning at 8:45. We're gonna rob my dad's bank. No, I-- Okay, my dad's bank swaps old bills For new ones every Monday. There is gonna be $200,000 in there, at least. We take as much as we need. And then go to jail, right? That's what I need? No no, every business in town knows when the money is there. Nobody is gonna suspect us. I spent four summers behind that counter. I know how it works. With my dad at graduation, The place is gonna be running on a skeleton crew. We can be in and out in 10 minutes. The money's Forge Hills'. No, it's insured. FDIC. No. No. We'll get summer jobs. We'll work overtime. We'll clean yards, okay? There's no other way to get the money we need as fast as we need it. So we're just gonna walk in and we're just gonna take the money just like that? gonna walk into the hospital and lay it down? No, he's right. We have to find someway to launder it somehow. Yeah, right. Right, launder it. Guys, come on. When did I become the voice of reason here, huh? You feel better? Now all we need are my dad's keys. - Hey, it's the Harvard girl. - Hey, Leroy. Hey, oh, did you see the news last night? Someone spotted Elvis at the game. I'm telling you, baby, he's everywhere. Yeah! - Hi. Is my dad in? - Hi. - When isn't he? - Right. You know, just between you and me, that eyeliner makes you look like a hooker. Thought you might want to know. Hey, Polly, what's up? I was just worrying last night about my moving to Boston. Honey, you're gonna have a great time there. Absolutely great. Didn't you live there once before you met Mom? When I met Mom, yeah. Yeah, at this-- This strange little skating rink that some friends talked me into going to. I fell right on my-- - Excuse me. - Oh. Yes, what can I do for you? I have some change that needs counting. Sure. I'll be right back. It's heavy. Oh, crap! Well, next thing I remember there was this beautiful hand reaching out to me. This beautiful face. I was a terrible skater. Can you hold that thought? Bathroom. Okay. Excuse me. Where's your bathroom? Hey, man, hell of a way to spend a Saturday. - Your pop still at lunch? - Yeah, man, all day. Good good. I need your expertise. What makes you think I'll cut these? All those times you kicked my ass wrestling. Dude, what happened to your eye? The tournament didn't go so well. Come on, Dean. What exactly are these barrel keys for? I was just using those for a new lock on my trunk to protect the woofers. We don't have blanks for these, man. You gotta have something. Right? I'll try and machine something at the back. Polly, hey, I was saying Mom is gonna wanna take you shopping. You know, the mall, free clothes. Yeah yeah, that'd be great, Dad. As a matter of fact, I actually-- I need some pants. God knows they got plenty of them at the mall. Nice. Thanks, dude. Thank you for coming to Forge Hills bank & Trust. Please come again. - Carl. - What? No way. Suzy Winters. What the hell happened to you? You know, after graduation, parents gave me the boot. But I worked retail for a while. It sucked. So I yanked the studs, threw out the leather And started here. And Suzy Winters goes suit. Not quite. Remember that thing we talked about a long time ago? I wanna do some furniture shopping with you. - Okay, sounds good. - Like organizational things, little boxes to put your Cd's. Iggy pop! That's so cool. You know, you are the first person to guess it. Yeah, well, the face is kinda messed up. I need you to go to the back and finish putting those files away. Barbara, I am helping a customer. Is that what you call it? What a vagina! That's strange. Where did I put my keys? I thought I left 'em right here. - Did you see them when you came in? - No, not at all. You know... I haven't been back to-- Yeah, me neither. Well, maybe we should give it a whirl, See if that tree is still there. We can follow it up with, like, a harmless, Like, non-sexual- vibe power lunch at steak and shake. - I'm vegan now. - No, you're vegan? I'm vegan, too. Better not, okay? It's nothing personal. It's just things are different now that I'm out of school. - You know? - Yeah. What about behind your computer? Yeah. Can I use your bathroom? Hey, Dad. - Oh. - Nice. Oh my god. - Sweetheart, thank you. - Of course. What am I gonna do without you? Okay okay, so we got the keys. - Yeah. - Yeah, what about the guards, the tellers? - Don't worry. I've got it covered. - How? Hey, would you just untwist your panties before your balls fall off? Don't dick with me, Carl, all right? I'm in a really unique mood. Graduation is a perfect alibi. Do you have anything vegan? Got peas and corn medley. Fill 'er up. - Good! - Yeah. - Good, here you go. - Thank you. Chauncey's right to be nervous. You see, Jackson's hearing me. When we do this, if we get caught we can't help Mrs. J. You're not gonna go to Harvard and we're all gonna go to jail. Okay, so who wants out? Carl, you're obviously in. Jackson? If you want me in, then just say you do. Of course I want you in. I'm in. The lobby alarm takes a four-digit code. I used to know it, but my dad changes it every couple months, so... Okay, see, that's it? Whoa whoa whoa, man, we're here, okay? Carl, your shirt. - My shirt? - Yes. You want my-- this is an original Iggy and the Stooges Tour shirt. I'll give you my jacket. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Never rob a bank without hairspray. We'll see every button he presses. But we still won't know the order, So what good does that do us? We'll figure it out. How many possibilities can there be? You know, factorials. What? - Right. - All right, come on, boys. Now there are no cameras back here, But there are two that are always taping the lobby. One of us is gonna have to go in during the day and scope them out. I'll take care of the damn cameras. Now every morning my dad and Barbara Are at the vault room door five minutes early. Now that door is gonna be easy 'cause it takes the same code as the lobby door. The vault, however, is a top-of-the-line claymore. My dad hands Barbara one of the two barrel keys, They insert into the vault at the same time. so then what happens? Small talk until 8:45. Has anyone ever tried to rob this bank before? Yeah, once, a couple summers ago. This guy came in drunk, just laid off. He had a knife. You can rob a bank with a knife? Well, not this one. Holy shit! - Jesus! - Whoa! After the guy dropped the knife, My dad set him up with a job at Associated. My dad the hero. Hmm. Okay, let's go. Oh, actually, if you could just sign right there. Thank you for coming to Forge Hills Bank & Trust. Who'd have thought corporate could be so hot? You are so darn cute when you're relentless. You know that? But you are also 18, okay? I am 19. That one year, it's dog years. It's light-years. - You're still in High School. - Doesn't matter. To you. But I've moved on now. I have my own place, My own car, bills. I even have my own cat. What are you doing tonight? I'm spaying my cat. Carl, if you wanna spend any more time with me, You are gonna have to open an account. Okay. Okay, it takes $100 down, Your driver's license. I'll provide the paperwork. Wow, can I do anything for free? Safe deposit box. Perfect. Here you go. Are you sure this isn't too much commitment for you? - 3. - Yep. - 0. - Mm-hmm. - 4. - Okay. - 3-0-9-4. - I got it. - 7. - Wait a second. 7? You said this was a four-digit code. If it's five numbers, it means it's gonna be a lot more than 24 possibilities. - How many's a lot? 120? And if we enter the wrong code, we have to wait three minutes before trying again. - This is great. - We're wasting time. - Just keep score, all right? - Yeah. So let's try it. - 30947. - 947. Okay, didn't work. Okay... We've done the 7s already, Chauncey. Oh, no no no. Don't-- don't-- don't look at me like that right now. - Hey, we get it yet? - No. Like what, Chauncey? - How was I looking? - Like I'm an idiot. Just-- - Try another code or something. - We have to wait. Let's try to figure out the tellers and the guard. Well, Leroy won't be a problem. I can take care of one of the tellers. Suzy-- we were in students of anarchy together. We hit it off a couple of times. Wait a second. You've been in the bank twice. - Did she see you? - Back off. No no no no, it matters, Carl. Did she see you? Sort of. Okay, from now on, you gotta stay as far away from her as possible. Fine. - Carl! - Okay! All right, good, it's settled. Just let's get back to the list. You're not even looking at the list, Chauncey. Your list doesn't make any sense. Listen, we've done the 3s, Okay, so it has to start with 0. In fact, it's... Hey! How you feeling, Mom? Just tired. The insurance is being really great, okay? So don't worry. We're gonna get you all fixed up. Good. # I'm just a memory in your heart # # I'm just a terrifying thing # # in the memories of the people # # all the people you betrayed # # and the people that you failed # # because you were not brave enough # # or you panicked and you ran # # or you were not brave enough # # and it's funny how it breaks... # - Hey. - Hey. - You missed fifth hour. - I was just doing a little research for the... You mind if I ask you a stupid question? - Shoot. You didn't think twice about any of this. Why not? Mrs. J. Same as all of us. - Uh, yeah. - I need a good name. - For what? - Any name. I don't know. What about my old cat? The great Manfredi? - It's perfect. - Okay. Come in. - Hey, Polly. - Hey. I wanted to give you a little something. It's always brought me nothing but the best. I wanted you to have it. I love you very much. Can't tell you how proud I am of you. Thank you. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm great. Hello. - I need you to sign and date these. - What are they? They say you accept the trust left to you by your late great-uncle Manfredi. I don't have a great-uncle Manfredi. You do now. Yo, Seniors, lunchtime! Oh, I-- sorry. - The front door was open. - That's fine. Chauncey's running late, so I thought I'd drop by. - Want some turkey loaf? - I think I'll pass. - This is amazing. - Yeah, it's cool, huh? They're blueprints of the bank from when it used to be the fire station. I tried to mark everything we need to know. You see this? It's in the station's blueprints, but it's not in the bank's. It's a drainpipe. It drips all the way to the lake. It's still there? And a million other secrets like it, Just little wrinkles in the building. See, there's a crawlspace behind your dad's office. It was used for storing hoses. I used to play in it all the time. - You okay? - Yeah, I just-- my-- my dad, he's-- he's sleeping with Barbara. It's fine. Oh, god. Never mind. I shouldn't have told you. I read somewhere that people who cry a lot live five years longer than people who don't. What? I get Chauncey and Carl. I get most people, But... I don't get you. I don't really get me, either. Wish I did. Then you wouldn't be so interesting. Who you taking to prom? Carl. Yeah, we haven't figured out who's gonna wear the dress yet. Why? Just wondering who the lucky girl was. All the lucky girls are taken. I should go. Hey hey. Hope you weren't waiting too long. - What were you doing at Jackson's house? - I was waiting for you. - Oh, is that it? - No, we had hot sex on his desk. Yeah, wouldn't doubt it, the way you've been looking at him. I didn't mean that, okay? Just ever since you got into Harvard, It's like you've already left. - There's a lot going on, Chauncey. - Yeah, I know. - I know. - Hey. Come here. Let's go, next three. You want me to do what? You have to bomb the biology final. Look look, I did the math. You're beating Jillian for valedictorian. What? I am? Oh my god. Oh my god! No no no no no, If you're valedictorian, You have to give a speech, okay? We're not gonna be there for the beginning of the show. But it's my best subject. If I fail, people are gonna think that I cheated. - No, they're gonna think that You spent way too much time with Chauncey. Next three! Fine fine, I'll do it. Whatever. - It's just a test. - No, nothing is just a test. Dear Leroy, as a token of appreciation For your loyal service, I've enclosed a little something - that you might enjoy. - Graceland! I know, it's short notice, but I'm also giving you Monday off. - Paid. - Right. - So enjoy. - And... give my regards to the King. - Respectfully-- - Oh, and please don't thank me.

Sure. - You okay? - Me? Yeah, your hand's a little clammy. I should warn you, My friends may freak. And it's-- It's just because they're not used to me dating, so... - Okay. Let's go. - Okay. May I just say you two are the cutest couple on the dance floor? I take that back. Hi, this is Suzy. She graduated a year before us. Hi. Hi. I work for your dad now. Right. Yeah. I'm Tom Jackson. I wouldn't know my hole from a head in the ground. All right. - Let's dance. - Let's. He's so dead. Okay, let's just talk about something else. Yeah, what did "sure" mean? It means okay, okay? No. Does Jackson got you giving me that look too? What look? That look.

But, you know, all of a sudden We just stopped hanging out. What happened? Graduation. # why did you not come to me? # # why did you not come to me? # # why did you not come to me? # # I am never brave enough... # Jackson. Polly. You go to north hills? Mm-hmm, all four years. Before that, St. Pat's? Parsons, "K" through eighth. Get out. So you're saying we've gone to school together for 13 years And we've never-- Never once danced. Can I ask you a personal question? Try me. What did you get on your S.A.T.? I don't remember. - Well, try. - I don't know. Don't bullshit me. You missed a perfect score by 20 points. - You looked at my score? - You can yell at me when I'm finished. I've had to slave to do what you can do in your sleep. - If you just tried... - You're smarter than you think. This isn't about me. Why try if I don't know what I want? I don't get you. Isn't that why you're dancing with me? Well, I'll take it from here, thanks. - No, just let me have this-- - No, now. Good evening, North Hillers. It is my pleasure To present your Booster Club President Mrs. Poole. You kids look like you're having fun. Now I am here to announce this year's Valedictorian. Polly Ann Deeley! How hard could it be to fail one test, Polly? - You should know, runner up. - Shut up, Romeo, I'll get to you next. It's not my fault. It was an essay test. - I wrote a bad essay. - Stop the goddamn presses. It's okay, all right? The vault opens at 8:45. I speak at 9:00. I just have to be there when they call me. We put our asses on the line for this and now you're screwing it up. Are you happy? Oh my god. You have been against this from the start. I vote it's okay. It'll be tight. It's possible. Me? I'm with Jackson. Okay, so robbery is now a democratic thing, is that it? Well, then I vote you can bite me. Hey, you know what? If you don't wanna go, I really don't want you there. - Can we just go inside? - No no no no. I vote we stay here now 'cause I'd like to hear about your girlfriend. Suzy is not up for discussion. That's funny, because she's between us and the money, So that pretty much makes her a hot topic. You're staying home! - Remember? - Screw you. Carl, I've been looking all over for you. Am I interrupting something? No. As a matter of fact, We were just talking about jumping off of a bridge, weren't we, Carl? So when do I jump? After us. I want... Carl's mom to get better. I wanna help Mrs. J. Pull through, Mrs. J. Mom. I want the stooges to tour again! # looking back right now I should have realized # # I should have left you all behind # # to go on to claim the prize # # I wish I'd known then what I know now # # just like everybody does # # when they're left wondering # # why what they are and what they was # # then I take a closer look # # at where I am right now # # with all I've done, what I've become # # is something anyhow # # and if there's anything I missed out on # # there's something else that's surely bound # # to come around # # just what the world is waiting for # # so don't let it # # get you down # # get up off the ground and move on # # 'cause yesterday has been gone for a while # # it's a million miles away # # from where you are today # # where you are today... # Carl?

You didn't tell us there was a gate behind this. It, uh... It wasn't here last summer. How thick do you think that bolt is? Quarter of an inch. That's nothing a blowtorch can't handle. Okay, I'm on it. Chauncey, give Carl your keys. - Give me the keys, man. - Yeah. Fine. Look, I don't care if you have to give the Gettysburg Address. Just don't let them hand out diplomas without us. Wait wait wait wait. Are you sure about this? No. In a moment, we will hand out diplomas. But first, it is my pleasure to introduce our Valedictorian-- Polly Ann Deeley. All right, whoo! Thank you. Good morning, and whew! Welcome to the big day. Chauncey, you're wasting your time. You know, it's bad enough I gotta lose her to you, But now you got her giving me that look, you know? - No, you're wrong. - I saw you two... Just now. It's Carl. - Chauncey, I don't-- - Just forget about it. Go answer the door. Oh, hello. Hello, you there? Hello. Carl get the torch? It's not Carl. Oh, shit! What are we gonna do, huh? I don't think we have a choice. Yeah, we gotta go out the back door. - No no. - What? We have to open the bank. Chauncey, she saw me. You're nuts. - Morning, ma'am. - Mm-hmm. I'll be right with you. Shh. And so to all my classmates, I wish you good luck And a great life. Just one more thing-- I just wanted to say that... You know, we're all these-- these-- We're all these diamonds in the rough. I need $400 in savings and the rest in checking. And I need $75 back in cash. - Is everything okay? - Fine. This'll just take me a minute. Okay, that's $20, $40, $60, $70 and $75. Here you go. Don't I need a receipt? Have a good day. How'd you do that? Hey, did that lady-- whoa! God damn it! Why do you have a gun, man? Checking or savings, Carl? Cash back. I know, you need a loan! What? And, um... Oh, god. You know-- you know, The future is wide open, guys, and... Chauncey, out! Yeah, I did it. Carl. Oh, god damn it. Damn it! Thought you said you were gonna take care of her, Carl. You were supposed to take care of me? It's not what you think. Fuck you. Tie her up. Look, Chaunce, let's just talk about it, okay? Let's talk about the fact that I told you guys this would happen. Hey! What? Did I not tell you? And nobody listened to me. Now tie her up. Carl, she's your girlfriend. Why don't you tie her up? Now, Carl. Carl, don't do this. Don't do this. Carl, what part of her walking to the cops Do you not understand? She walks, we go to jail, and your mom still dies. Why don't you guys get that, huh? She's not gonna say anything, okay? You understand? She's not gonna talk. Right, Suzy? You're not gonna say anything, right, Suzy? You wanna take that chance, Carl? You're not gonna say anything, right? No, I'm not gonna say anything. She's gonna walk out of here. She's gonna pretend like none of this ever happened, okay? - Okay? - No, Carl, please. Hey, Chauncey, put the gun down. - No. - I'm backing up. Back up. No. - Chauncey, I'm turning around. - No, Carl, don't do this. - I'm sorry. - Carl! Really helped shape us into-- into-- --people from these raw lumps of clay. And-- and-- And we're gonna be... ...the leaders of tomorrow... Today, thank you. We got E.M.S. Standing by? What the hell? - They're in position, sir. - Wave to me, boys. This is Captain Hale. You'll do what I ask when I ask it. I don't know if you've tried these stunts anywhere else, but you're in Forge Hills now and we do things a little different in Forge Hills. We do 'em my way. What did they say, Sir? Talk to me like that again and I'll shoot a hostage in the gut, okay? I'll give him the phone and I'll let him tell you how he likes The way you run things in Forge Hills. Do you understand me? Yeah, I understand. I want a helicopter. I want pizzas-- Five-- Delivered to the door. In return, I'll give you two hostages. Give me half an hour. I want someone from the crowd-- The redhead in the robe. What does he want? Wrigley, call Johnny's. Get me five pizzas. What would you like on them, Sir? Do I look like I give a good goddamn? - Dean, I need to talk to you. - Okay. Polly, the gunman's asked for food, but he won't let my men deliver it. - He asked for you. - What? No! - You don't have to go inside-- - Send somebody else. You don't have to go inside. You go up to the door. - Drop the pizzas and step away. - Absolutely not, no. Dean, I wouldn't have asked this if he didn't have hostages. He can have whatever's in the vault. He cannot have my daughter. No, Dad, I can help. It's just up to the door, right? Look, I wanna help. Remember, drop the pizzas and step away. We're ready when you are, Polly. Hello. Hello. Don't put the pizzas down. Who's she talking to? Chauncey, is that you? It's Jackson. Be careful. There are snipers everywhere. Who's blood is that? Look at the police, okay? Look like you're scared. I am scared. Good good. Okay, now come inside. Watch your step. What's it like outside? They're ready to cut the power and come in. How did this happen? Hey. We gotta get you out of here, buddy. No, wait wait wait. Where is my necklace and my shirt? It's right here. Hey hey, our friends outside are expecting two hostages, okay? I have to send him. I need you to go with him. - He used me. - No no no no. He did this for his mom, all right? Believe me, what happened between the two of you was an accident. This is one of my tellers. Suzy, Suzy, are you okay? Suzy, how many hostages are still in there? I don't know. I guess two plus Polly. And is she okay? Yeah yeah, she's fine. And how many gunmen? There's just one gunman, and he's wearing a mask. Tell me you didn't bring me in here just to help you think of a plan. I didn't bring you in here to help me think of a plan. I'm serious, Jackson. Well, aren't you gonna answer that? Come on, come on, come on. What is that? It's a secret. Where's my helicopter? It's on its way. Give me 10 more minutes. No no, you've had half an hour. I just can't pull a helicopter out of my ass. - We need more time. - No, no time. Okay, get her out. Get her out! We'd better hurry. Chauncey. Cut power to the bank. All units, we're going in! Polly, come on. Set the charges. Everybody back around the side. Where is he? - Polly! - Polly! - How are you, honey? - Good. Smart bastard. Took what he could and torched the rest. Aren't you coming in? No. No, you and Jackson go. I don't think Carl wants to see me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. And tell Mary I said I'm sorry. - I can come by later-- - No no. No, it's cool. I'm gonna be okay on my own. How is she? Sleeping. Carl. Carl, I have to go. I was hoping maybe I could say goodbye to her. What? Yeah yeah. She'd be pissed if you didn't. You left this at the bank. From your great uncle Manfredi. Jackson, you look... Different. I do? You're all grown up. I don't understand. Why do you have to leave? You know how many times I've jumped off that bridge? And I've never made a wish for myself 'cause I never knew what I wanted. You don't have to leave to figure it out, Jackson. I'm not. # you're in the moon, but your head's # # in the stars # # now you can run # # but you can't hide # # who you are... # - Dad. - Polly. I'd-- I'd like to see my safety deposit box, Mr. Deeley. Please. Mr. Deeley, I finished transferring Barbara's files. Thank you, Charlie. Watch the counter for me till I'm finished, will you? Where's Barbara? A management job opened up in Iron City, so... Polly, I want you to know-- Hey. Ready. Okay, let's go. Whoa-oh-oh-oh. He didn't-- he-- He didn't suspect anything. You want a ride? I think I'll walk. Polly... Thank you. Everything changes the day you graduate. Look at the four of us. Carl inherits the money to help his mom And lands the girl of his dreams. Chauncey's heading for State, ready for a new life on his own. Polly will go to Harvard And probably never look back. As for me, I'm doing more than anyone expects of a kid With bad grades and no prospects. I'm pursing a career. Of all things. Sorry, ma'am, we're just running a little late today. - Where's Mr. Connelly? - He has the flu. Everyone has it. So anyway, he called this morning To see if I would come in and hold up the fort. Hold up the fort? What can I do for you today? Well... I'd like to make a deposit. I just get so nervous keeping all this cash around the house. Think you can take that off my hands? That's what I do, ma'am. # 12 miles to nowhere and you're out of gas # # but you're keeping your head # # laugh out loud in the mystical crowd with no laughs # # but you're keeping your head # # see the sky's gonna dot your eyes, but damn # # keeping your head # # get me down 'cause you can't hear a sound # # 'cause I know, I know your hands are # # keeping your head # # I know you are keeping your head from falling down # # 12 miles to nowhere, you're out of gas # # keeping your head # # laugh out loud in the mystical crowd with no legs # # but I know you keep your head # # see the sky's gonna dot your eyes, but damn # # keeping your head # # don't get me down 'cause you can't hear a sound # # 'cause I know, I know your hands are # # they're keeping your head # # keeping your head # # keeping your head from falling down # # you're keeping your head, I know you are # # keeping your head, I know that you are # # keeping your head from falling down # # keep your head from falling down. #
