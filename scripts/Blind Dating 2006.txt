They're always trying to help. Always trying to save me from myself. Danny? Are you alright? Honey, are you ok? Sweety, talk to me, Are you alright? I'm ok. - Way to go, asshole. - Lorenzo! My mother was a kind of person, who's love could kill you if you weren't careful. Guess she blamed herself for I was born 3 months premature. I was just in a hurry to get out! I'm always in a hurry. - Hey, Danny. - Hi .. put your hands. Daddy, can I hit? No,it's Danny's turn. Here we go. I am gonna pull this thing right at the ball, it's gonna make that noise. When you hear it, wack it. swing.. You suck! My dad was cool. He never were like my mom. He knew that I didn't wanna go to blind school So he sent me to normal school. And he let me and my brother visit him at work. Help! There two blind kids robbin a train, Help! Larry, my brother. Only two years elder than me, was a boy with a mission. He took up by himself in an early age: teach me about life. - Come on, Danny, you will like it. - Don't do that, remember Last time! You keep out of this. This candy is not for little girls. This candy's is only for men. Come on.. Danny take a piece. Yeah, dog shit again! As we grew up, Larry's life-lessons continue. What's happening? Is she dying? In front of Danny! What's the problem, he can't see nothin. God can see! Nedless to say that by the time I was a young man, I needed help. Try to be more specific Danny. Why do you think, you feel this way? I guess i'm just curious? You know.. I run my fingers over my face, but... But that tells me shit about how I look. And that matters to you, does it? Sure yeah, of course it does. Even Maria has got these friends, and they come by. She's 14years old. You know, these girls freak me out. I wanna know that girls are attracted to me. .. and don't feel just sorry for me, or give me pitty... I feel like I'm 12year old, trapped in a 22year old body, you know? It's perfect. I am 22 year old blind virgin, who doesn't know anything about girls. At least I want to know that I don't look like some kinda monster. Believe me, Danny. You don't look like a monster. Doc, you naked again? - Sorry, Danny. - Oh Doc! You promised, you weren't gonna do that anymore! It's Just that.. something... a little problem. I'm working on it. Doc, you are the smartest people, I know. But I think.. ...you might be crazier than most your patients. You know that? Sometimes I just feel this need to break out. To be free, to be who I really am. I am sorry Danny, it will never happen again. I promise. - You said that last time. - I know, I know. And I'll probably say it again. You're a cook, you know? But I love you. So, where were we? Ok, so apart from the fact that I got this problem with women, I'm handling things pretty well. - Hi, Danny. - Hi girls. So cute. Danny, Danny! Come on in, your father wants to talk to you. Sit down. Don't you wanna sit down? No, what's up? - I'd say go for it, Danny. - Go for what? It's too dangerous. - How could you do this to me? - how could I do what to you? What are you talking about? - But It's Danny's big chance! - It's out of the question! Does somebody wanna fill me in what we're talking about? - You stay out of it! - Shut up! Danny, we got a call from a doctor.. ahh doctor... - what was his name? - Parkins. - That wasn't it. - Yeah, It was, Parkins. - No, it was somethin.. - You talked to him on the phone! - No.. - It's Perkins! A Doctor Perkins, he said you were maybe gonna volunteer for some ...sort of experimental operation. Maybe he can make you see? What's going on here? How come you ever said nothing? I didn't say anything because I hadn't volunteer for anything yet. - You don't talk to me about these things anymore? - It's not a big deal. - Yes,this is a very big deal, what's going on? It's not gonna happen, there are risks! You don't know, there could be problems. Hey Mom, you wanna let him make up his mind once in his life? - Mom, what if he could see? - Exactly, what if can see? You are a guinea, not a guinea pig! Oh where are you going? Come back here! This is exactly why I dont say anything! I don't wanna worry you Ma, I don't wanna give everybodies hopes up either. I mean,.. I don't wanna go through this yet.. Danny, it's your call, Whatever you decide to do... - We're all behind you. - I know, Iknow. -He? I am hungry, ma, how about some dinner? Where I'm going you can't come, What I've got to do you can't be any the part of it. He's looking at you, kid.  Hey D! Yo Danny boy - Jo, What's up? - Hey man. I've got some balls down the court, who swe-ne-ga-geng. - So what do you think, we make some bucks? - Yeah. Let's do it. Danny, are you nuts! Danny will you... - Yeooow That's it, I'm convinced, you are the Batman. - How's your sonar? - OK. Lets do it. - For money? Hey, you guys. This is the guy I was telling you about. Llike I said, he wins, you guys gonna pay 5 to 1. That's only fair. How's he gonna know where the loop is? What, are you the handicap police? Take a shot, show 'em. - Ehmm - Wait it fella, listen.

You guys loose, pay up. Here we go Now we are talking. - What is it? -50 Bucks. -50 bucks? You are amazing, you know that right? Way, this is going to help most of my tuition fee. Yeah, looks like a basket-ball scout to me. And how about you, what's going on with that law-school thing? - I've got my first class coming up. - Really? -Yeah! Ready? - Of course I am man. I am here to eat please. Gina said that if you'd ask her out, that she'd say yes. Hit me, hit me.. You're so strange. How come you never wanna go out with one of my friends? - Leave your brother alone. - Because they're 14 Maria. Besides, what could these girls offer him? Look,the time of his life ma, that's what they could offer him. - Not everyone is like you Lorenzo. - That's what you think. At least you're in your own apartment, you don't bring them here anymore. - Thanks to God. - See, this is why I love coming over here. Danny, do you remember that girl? Ass like a coconut? She is laying in the bathtub, he has no idea he turns on the water, She almost has a heart att... OK! OK! Maria is here! You're right. Sorry.. Maria forgive me. So Danny, can you tell us more about this operation? There'll be volounteers much papa, so what's the hurry? The doctor said that family is Important. - Yeah Mama. It's important to stay out of it. - To give support. - Maybe tomorrow we can drive you there? - No it's alright, Jay's given me a ride. Ohhh, Jay's gotta wheels now,he? Let go my ears. Ohh shit! Danny, what are you doing?! In which way, man? Man. That's wheels. - Hey you don't need a ride to make it home? - Yeah. - Alright buddy, have it going alright?! - I'll do. I thought you told mom that you'll gonna be here watching her...  Second. - Are you ok? - I'm fine. Noooo! Where is Doris? Hey, where is Doris? - Look, what do you want, can't you see I'm busy? - No, I can't see that you're busy Can't you see that I'm fucking blind? He said the B-word! He said the B-word. - What happened to Doris? - She's on vacation. It's too bad, I liked her. What're you staring at? The signal from the camera which is mounted on the glasses... .. goes directly to a chip, which is implanted in the visual cortex of the brain. - So my eyes are not part of the process then? - Absolutely, the camera bypasses them. But Danny remember. We don't see with our eyes. We see with our brains. Now, I'd like to tell you that if the operation is successfull, .. you would be able to see like everyone else. But that's not going to happen. The best you can hope for... ...is a fuzzy black and white image... .. may it'll be good enough to keep from bumping into things.. .. may be it'll be enough to see your face. Yea? Oh, thank you.. Yes, please It's doctor Evans. I'd asked her to join us. I know you know her. You'll feel comfortable with her She's going to be a vital member of the team. Doctor Evans. Ohh, Doctor Perkins. Amarige. Yes, Danny that's right. That's my new set. - Do you like it? - Yeah.. yeah it suits you. What do you think doc? It smells good. Doctor Evans is going to be responsible for putting together the psychological reports.. .. of all the potential candidates for this operation. - I'd have no problem with that. - Good. So all we really need to know, that if the FDA gives us green light. Can we put you down as a potential candidate? Oh, you can take your time, Danny. This is a... very important decision. - So, do you have someone leading you? - No, I'll get a cab, if you can put me in the right direction. You know how to get out of the building,right? Hang to the left, go about 15 paces you should reach the street... ...and a cab should be waiting there. - Sounds good. -Ok. - I can take him Doctor Perkins. - I'm leaving now. - I think I can manage, Doris. The name is Lisa. Why doesn't he use his cane? Because he doesn't think himself as blind. - Good night, Doris. - Good night, Danny. Taxi! Lisa, you're late, they are waiting for you. - Arvind is here? - And Mr. Bhat. I'm sorry, I forgot. I think you shouldn't say that to your future husband. Go go go - You are in big trouble. - Take a hike Ravi, or I tell them what I found under your bed. - Hey - I'm sorry I'm late. - It's ok. I apologize for keeping you waiting. Why? Do you not speak English? Of course I speak English. I see your daughter does not forward traditions or respect to elders.. ...as well as punctuality. For my daughter, punctuality is an aspiration.. .and respect has to be earned. Nice pal! That's my computer. - I'm sorry, I didn't see it. - Just pick it up and give it to me. Relax, I'm looking for it. Just give it back. So they know you're blind, They'd find out sooner or later. It's none of their business. Besides, in fact he was rude. I should've smacked his face. - You didn't tell me that he was rude to you. - Yeah, he was rude. You wanna turn around by now? I would beat the shit out of him. No, killerman, may be later. - Is there something in the back? - Yeah. Suzie is in the back. - Suzie? -Suzie - Who's Suzie? Ehmm, Danny... Suzie is a hooker. - And she's in the back with someone? - Yes she is. Oh Jesus, what's going on? Look I haven't got a booking. I've been running out the car for my lady friends... .. and they take care of the business in the back with their Johns... ...now the Johns, they have to pay an extra 50$ cause thats classified as kinky sex. That extra 50$ goes to the house. Your's truly. - Hey you wanna go something to eat man? These soundstracks make me hungry. - So you gonna through with this surgery or operation or what? -I don't know. - What do you have to lose? - Half my brain? - Half your brain? What do you mean? - I told you, ...they have to implant this chip in my brain. - This is like brain surgery? - Yes genius, like brain surgery. You are a slap. - What 're you doing? - You're making a mess. Look at you face! This may have like a significant "oops" factor? What? "oops" we lost your the half of your childhood memories. Sorry! Exactly. What's the opposite? Well they said if it works, they set the mother of this I can get a... fuzzy, black and white image. No no no, we don't want anything less than full blure HD colour, you know? Digital! - Denver - It was in Dallas, killed the man in there... And looked still alive. - Watching him die.. - Excuse me.. This gentleman has a favour to ask you. Yes, picture. Oh you wanna take a picture? Sure, alright. Here we go. Ready? - Don't press the babes, sweety. -1,2,3.. - Here we go. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Aregato! - Aregato - Arregatoo! - Thank you! - Thank you, sweetheart. - Who is your friend? - Oh, Suzie, This my brother Danny - Get out!

No charge of course. - Ok you boys. - You little sexy thing. - Have a great night. - Hey, I'll see you tomorrow. - I see you! - Alright. What a woman. She just made you an offer you can't refuse. Oh stop it! Danny, what top top bullshit means? Watch your step. You know, we both know you haven't done it! In your age, it's not natural man! That could stop to build up all kind of pressure and.. .. let's not forget about your prostate. No, no, no,hold on, hold on. This is why all guys have all those problems! No sex. You think having a relationship, hasn't been on my mind? I'm not talking about a relationship. I'm talking about sex. You know, Danny, You do wanna do it with a women? Right?! Yes, of course I do. I just had a kind of headaches, you know? You gave me kind of a heart stop for a second. Look, you don't understand Larry, I don't want something cheap.. I'm looking for the real thing. Fine, so you hook up with one nice girl. I don't want anything arranged, neither a hooker. OK, no hookers. I'll find a good girl for you. No I don't think so, we've been through this before. You know what I think? I think you're scared. Bullshit! - Credible with a vagina? - Shut your mouth! Scared of a vagina! - It's gonna be a real date. You know, dinner and everything. -Yeah You know, take her back to my placet. If we feel something for eachother, she wants to do it.. Then we'll do it, only if she want's to do it. Yeah yeah Danny, that's how it usually works. Otherwise they arrest you and charge you with rape. Why you laugh? What? - I was just thinking that It'll be a real blind date! - After 22 years you just thought of that joke? Open the window down, please. You still wearing that cologne? - You don't like that? - Truly! You've breaking my balls, you would have liked that! - So who she is? - I don't know, Mandy so far. Do you trust Larry?

He looks good. - Did you do this? - Yes. What? - Let's gonna change that shirt. - What's wrong with the shirt? Nothings wrong with the shirt! A lot is wrong with that shirt. We don't need another Tony Soprano in our house. - Do not say anything bad about Tony Soprano. - Larry you can leave now. Guys, guys! The shirt, the shirt. What's wrong? - Larry? - Out! - I was just trying to help. Larry what is it? What's wrong with it? - Very loud! - OK, pick another one. Nice shirt! I bought you this shirt. Come on, come one. - So how do you know her? - She's a friend of a friend. - Incredible. - I'm not done yet Danny. You make a blood-off that she's no dog. Or I stay. - Are you kiddin me? - No. - You don't trust me anymore? - In one word, no. - And why not? - Are you forgetting Gracia Moreno in 10th grade? - Gorilla Moreno? - Yeah. Some people thought that girl was hot. She smelled like a shaggy carpet. You make yours or I stay! - Fine. I make your stupid cut. - Oh, god that hurts! - Sharp edge, Larry. -I'm on it. - A blood-off is when we both cut ourselfs. - No. - Yes,it's what it is. -No. - You cut yourself! - You do it first. - Do it. -No! - Cut yourself. - Are you gonna do? - No. - So let's get out of here. - Fine, fine.

You don't.. just think I'm this intelligent born, I don't know it differently. Oh, brave. We will talk about you, how is that? Tell me something about yourself? There's not much to talk really, I'm 25 yearsold... ...I work as secretary... .. people think I that look like Meryl Streep... But you never know what Meryl Streep looks like! I think the next one should not be so sensitive. - Evening. - Get out of my way, asshole!. Can't you see he's blind? Look what you did? Danny, come here honey Let me help you. - Alright -Oki, put me down. Put me down. Put me down! I can walk. Just trying to help. You gonna get the door open bigbutt? Let's go! Larry, Larry. - Here you go. - Thank you. Please. Lady's first. - I'm sorry. - Really, no problem. Cheers baby. So Danny, tell me.. .. your physical guard? Like to do some working-out? - Sure. - What you press? - 50pounds maybe. - I like that.. I like a man with sense of humor. Mummy's gonna help you out. I can eat on my own. It's fine. - Hey, I'm just trying to create some chemistry baby. - I gotta go to the bathroom. - I'll take you. - I can walk. Mama hasn't have action like this for weeks, I'am hungry, let's go. Danny boy?! Mama is here, Danny? Pick up, pick up, pick up! You better get your ass here. She's crazy. Danny, open the door. - Signora, I must ask you to leave. - Don't Signora me Pablo. Better hold on to your squirrel, Before he loses his nuts. Signora, take your time. Can I get you something to Drink? - An expresso perhaps? - Out! - Oh God, get out of here! - Have you ever done it in the bathroom Danny? I just wanna meet a normal woman. I will tear you out ... big mama... I have been looking so forward to this night, that I.. brought a little something along with me as a suprise. Danny, I wanna feel the way that you feel, I wanna see the things that you see. I wanna be as one with you Danny. Look! - I have a blindfold, I can see the blackness! - Larry! - Doris still on vacation? - You're bright good at this, aren't you? I've got good instinct. I will tell him you're here. This is a very big decision Danny. - You're sure you wanna do it? - Yeah, sure I am. - That's very brave of you Danny. - You sound like I'm volounteering for a... .. suicide mission? Is it? No, no. What I ment to say was, neurosurgery is never without risks... - .. and it would be wrong to say otherwise. - What are the risks? We really don't know. Help! I.. I think what Doctor Perkins is trying to sayv is that... .. you're very couriagous... ...to try something, that has not been done, very often. I can take Mr. Waldesakee to a cab Doctor. If he wants. Sure. They told me... .. there's allways risks with brain surgery, but what the hell, you gotta be brave sometime. Sure you gotta be brave, but it's not so smart to walk around without a cane.. Step! Thanks Mom. You're welcome. You're in luck, here is the cab. I gotta confess something, I don't really need a cab... .. I just kinda wanted to talk. Oh, well, that is very sweet. My brother Larry is gonna pick me up. He uh... .. runs a Limo Service. - He's not here yet. - How can you tell? If he were here, trust me, you'd know it. But when he allready comes, can we give you a ride? Oh, thanks but I better not, my bus is here.. - .. so I better go. - Yea. -OK.. - Bye. -Ok. See you soon! - Thanks mom. - Thank you. If she brings us any more food, we could open our own restaurant. We don't have to. After we get married, we're gonna take over this one. It's all been discussed. - Oh and what else has been discussed? - That you will run this place.. - .. until we start having kids. - And have you discussed when that's gonna be? The sooner the better. And eh... I think we start practising now. Arvind. What if I don't want to run this restaurant? What if want to go to Medical School? What? Sorry. The final choice isn't going to be made on abthomal criteria. It's probably going to be made on a candidate's personality. His ability to cope with the... ...success or failure of the operation. Danny! Do you wanna join me for lunch? I got to the Park across the road. - I got turkey and cheese - You have any shrimp? - No. - Allright. ...my brother Larry, when I was a kid, old me thats a kid supposed to run free, in a park. That's what parks are for. But he didn't tell me about trees. I really hate trees. Like a lot. - Can we take a walk? - Wait a minute. You want me to follow you? No, you lead. I just give you a shoulder. - Rights - Lead. - Where are we going? - Do you like baseball? - I don't know, I've never been. - You've never been? -No. You'll love it. It's a beautiful game. You got the smell of the grass... .. the sound of the ball when it gets crushed. - There is nothing like it. - Maybe I should go sometime? Does Doctor Perkins talk to you about the operation? Yeah, he said the final choice will be based on personality. You're not gonna have a problem there. - I am not so sure about that. - Danny, I've worked with a lot of visiually impaired people... .. and I can honestly say, I've never met anyone like you. - What do you mean? - Well... .. it's this feeling oyu give to other people. - And you don't use your cane.. - I use my cane. - Not always! And that's supid and dangerous and... ...also kind of brave. - You thought about a guide dog? - Oh yeah, walk dogs. Just got this little problem with dog shit. I guess what I wanna tell you is, you're ok. Think I'm ok enough that you have dinner with me? OK! - Who are these friends you're going out with? - Just friends from the hospital mom. Bye! - Thank you. - Thanks. I mean I like to read.. ...but I love to watch movies, because movies... .. they don't not describe the trees, the sky.. ...and the birds and all that stuff, in movies they just talk. They just talk. And when I hear someones voice, it tells me so much about people. Like your voice. Your voice tells me that.. .. ahh, wait. You have short black hair... .. and.. .. you have these big, beautiful, dark eyes. - Doctor Perkins could have tell you that. - No, it's your voice. I'm telling you.. And your hair, I can tell it is short, because I can hear it's rushling around. Altough I did take a chance in your eyes, but now I know it's true.. .. they are big and beautiful. I'll figure a lawyer, you now has got to read people's minds.. .. and when you're blind that's mostly what you do. - And are you reading my mind? - Yes, sure. -And? I can tell that you wanna be here... .. but there's also something holding you back.. .. and I don't know what this is. I think you're gonna be a very good lawyer. What I'd really like to do is... .. go to medical school. And then join Doctor Perkins' research team. - Why don't you? - It's not that simple. - I am a woman. - I noticed. And one day I'd like to get married have a family.. - Can't you do both? - No. Not without an understanding husband. So you just gonna have to choose the right one. - That is one fine lady Mr. Waldesakee. - Thank you, James. I can smell when Mrs. Luciano makes fettucini food 3 blocks away... .. or they cut grass on the baseball field... .. I love your perfume.. .. and your smile. You smell that the blossoms are out earlier this year!? Now you show out. - Is anybody else around? - No, we are alone. I had the best night I've ever had. I just hope it's been half as good for you. I've had a wonderful time. Alright, thanks. An oil leak now. So will you tell me about it? She is the most natural person on the whole world. She's got the most beautiful smile. How do you know, what her smile looks like? You don't understand, It's the sound of it. I love the sound of her smile. So why did you not take her back to my place last night? Look it's not everything coming down to sex. That's true, money and looks are important too. Hey Mike. Don't forget to clean those footprints of my ceiling. - Unbelievable. - What's so unbelievable? - Your face. - It's hot. - Hi! - Hey. They're gorgeous, thank you. - Do you like Humphrey Bogart? - I like Humphrey Bogart. Let's go, kid. - And what about us? - Always have Paris. We lost him, until you came to Casablanca? We got him back last night I said I would never leave you.  You never will.  I gotta job to do too.  - Danny, I've gotto go. - No, don't go. Lisa, I never felt this way for any other woman before. - I'll see you soon, ok? - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye! Arvind will take over the business in a few years, when I retire. And with a loyal wife by his side, he will be well able to provide for his family. Arvinds I believe will provide for his future family are no doubt because he's Indian. And there should be no doubt of the loyalty of his future wife either. I want to tell you how proud we are all of you Danny. First for getting chosen for this operation, and.. .. second, for having pale to go through it. - What does "pale" mean? - Balls! -Stop corrupting me common, please. Thank you, pop. Thank you, Larry. I would just like to say that.. ...If this thing does workout... .. and I can see your faces for the first time.. .. and I find out that you're all too ugly, I'm moving out! -Heyyy - Chinchin - Salut -salut -salut! Doctor Perkins says if it's succesfull.. .. I might be able to see enough to.. .. get around, even identify faces. I might be able to see your face. And know what you look like. Only a man can cause joy one day and tears the next. What has Arvind done? Mom it isn't not Arvind. - Is he Hindu? - He's not Indian. A few years after I came to this country, I met this man. An american. He was very handsome like a moviestar. Everytime I saw him my heart jumped. - Mom, what happened? - He met a beautiful American girl. Nothing to be sad about, just thankful. I met your father just after that. You are my only daughter, and I love you very much. But, you made a promise to Arvind. And only you can decide, if you can honor that promise or not. I'm sorry, I should have told you earlier. - What are you talking? What does that suppose to mean? - Danny, I've had a wonderful time with you.. and... .. no one's ever made me feel this way.. .. but I'm engaged to be married. Engaged to be married? What is that supposed to mean? It means I can't see you anymore. Am I missing something here?! I don't understand. I'm sorry. I've should have told you earlier. Do you love this guy? Do you!?! - He's a nice guy Danny. - That doen'tanswer my question! - Do you love him? - It's not that simple! There's a lot more to it than that! Just be honest with me. At the end of the day, you'd rather be with someone who can see.. .. instead of some asshole blind guy. Danny, I know what it's like to get dumped. I understand. What you've got to do is look at it like you're one of the ten guys. OK? For every 10 "no"'s that you get you gonna get 1 "yes", ok? So.. .. this "no" is really just bringing you that much closer to a "yes". Trust me on this Danny, It's all mathematics. Ready, set, pitch! Wow! Elbony double for sure. I smell money man.. - Hey, hey hey. - What's up? It doesn't bother you? That I can't see, does it? No! Even when we were at school and you helped me all the time? Ohh, wait a second. It's those girls you've been dating? - I just don't get it man! - Look Danny boy.. Girls are something you can not figure out. Alright? But if they can't realize that you're a good guy go around, srew 'em. You're high man, common, next pitch. So where we're going? I just wanted to get some air. And so does your familiy! It's ok, Its ok. You look so beautiful tonight I just wanted a little bit of time alone with you. They are crying up to me all night, "Alvind"... - Stop! stop it! - Soon we will be married.

Why didn't you tell me? No, no, look. I just thought that may be I could go out with someone.. Who didn't first have to come with the terms with the fact that am blind. Blind! I thought that you're gay! Mrs. Waldesakee, if Danny misses any more tests, we won't be able to proceed with the operation Thank you for calling, Doctor. Mama relax, I'll find him. OK? Let's play some balls. - You're OK boss? - Yep! - Check it out. Blind guys shoot first, you understand? - How do I know he's blind? - Because you... .. low boy, all the world knows he's blind. - And what are you, an eye specialist or something? - What are you talking about boy? Give me that! Hej, J! You smell that? - Smells like ass man! - What!? Hey! Big man! - Like into blind kid? Endow him, Larry. Let it go! Let go! Why haven't you going to the Doctor? Danny, just tell me what the problem is.. .. I promise you, It's not as bad as you think. I don't understand you anymore man. This operation is something for you, You understand that? It's gonna make you life better. Why would you wanna ruin that? I'm gonna be right by the car, making calls. If you need me right? - Danny, hi. - Hi. - I'ill tell Doctor Perkins you're here. - Yeah, do that, just... .. tell him I'm here. Because I'm here. Danny, I need to know that you still feel positive about this operation. I tell you what.. Why don't you see Doctor Evans one more time... She give's us her assessment, we take it from there? Danny, wait. Look, can we go to the park and talk? - I never really explain myself too well. What's to explain? You're getting married! Danny, please. Danny.. Danny, please. Danny, there is something else I should have told you before. - Oh Jesus, You're carrying his child? - No! I haven't even slept with him. I haven't slept with anyone, ever! Join the club! Danny, I'm Indian. It's hard to explain.. ...what that means, to someone, who isn't Indian. It's a different world. It's a different culture. - This guy is Indian too, right? - Yes, he is. When I asked you if you'd love him you couldn't answer me. My family's concept of love isn't what you think it is. - It's gotta do with duty.. ...and loyalty and responsibility.. - To who? Danny. I can't go against my family. I can't break a promise I'd made. I'm sorry. And It's got nothing to do with you beeing blind. Who knows.. .. when you can see.. .. you might not like me anyway. I'm not an american beauty. I've gotta go. - Did I do something wrong? - No Danny Falling in love with someone, who is really engaged is not a crime. But it's a crime for her falling in love with me? Is that what it is? No, falling in love is completely natural. I mean, we even don't have control over it. - Then maybe it's like men slaughter? - I don't understand? - When you do something, and you don't really mean it. No. No falling in love is.. .. is the most beautiful thing in the whole world! Yes. Yeah I guess so. - Are you naked today Doc? - No. No, but I'd like to be. - Doctor Sato, we can do this. - I think it's impossible, He's missed too many tests, he's obviously not comitted. We have enough time to finish those tests before the operation, I promise you this boy is comitted. Most of us live our lifes.. .. viewing it from the outside-in. Danny experiences his world from the inside-out. And that's his strenght. He is more than capable of dealing traumatic change. And with coping with the outcome of operation, whatever that may be. - I'm here, if you need me. - Thank you. What? Is my baby gonna be alright? He's going to be just fine. 'Cause if anything should happen to him there's gonna be a lot of shouting. Down here and in heaven. You are a good mother. And you gotta good boy. Nothing's gonna happen to. No one's gonna have to shout. Yes.. I'll be there like 9:30. Ready. - The lead? - Ready. Activities normal All readings stable Automatic pressure up Mr. Waldesakee. Excuse me.. Danny came through surgery beautifully. He's doing very very well. - So when can we see him? - When he wake's up. And we start our tests.. .. as soon as he's strong enough. - How are you? - Let's do this. -Alright. You're going to feel a little pressure. - You all right? - Fine. I'm putting on the glasses. And when the time is right.. .. take all the time you need.. I'm going to turn on the power, to the camera. You let me know. - I'm ready. - Good man. We're gonna do this on the count of 3. Alright? One. Two. And three. Right, tell me what's happening. - What's happening? - What is it Danny? Hurts a little bit. There is some... There's... There's something here there. - Things... - Things? Probably fuzz leads.. This is an indication that the visiual cortex is beeing simulated. It's not all black anymore, it's... Is there... Something here like a... .. square, Square? Danny, that's a window! - Something moved! something moved. - That's me! That's me, you saw me in front of the window! It's a good start.
