I'm gonna go set up the bedroom. I'll be up to check it out in a second. I've been noticing this on your hand. I've never seen this before. - Um... it's just... - Wait, wait, wait. I'm feeling there's some special energy about this. What... no, I'm really... What is in here? No, Kara, honestly, give this back! I'm sorry, no secrets! I'll share this with you later. I'm gonna go check on the crew. Okay... no, wait, wait wait! You're not zipped. Hold on. Come here. I have a problem finishing. - I'm gonna do the wide of that. - Yeah. Ben looks like he has everything under control. - Okay, but did he check the Polaroid? - He checked the Polaroid. 'Cause if the bedside table doesn't match, it's gonna drive me crazy. It will match. We're taking care of it. - All right. - So that looks good. So you know what? Can you guys handle the rest? I really have to check on Zoe. I'm feeling very angsty. There are a few things I need to go over with you. You guys can deal with it, right? You guys. Kieran, can you have somebody move this? Hey! There she is. How's my girl? Good! Just remember to be yourself today. That's all you need to worry about. I mean, I'll tell you right now, 'cause Mal is not coming, and I mean, she just doesn't care about your thing, she doesn't care about me, she doesn't care about you, like, she's not gonna actually show up, so I'm actually okay, because I know she's not going to be here. - She has to come. - She didn't have to come. - She kinda has to come. - Okay, we'll see. - I'll check back later, okay? - Mm hmm. Guys, I need her out in ten! - Hey... - Zoe's just a mess. Kieran wants to know why Mal's call time was pushed back. It's a personal thing. I talked to her last night. Which is actually really good, because Zoe came in late and she's still in the makeup chair. They would have totally run into each other. Tell me we're gonna get through this. How are we gonna get through this? We're gonna get through this. Can you... just pray a lot. - Okay. - Okay? Hey, can I get a stand-in, please? Her favorite part is standing in. Oh, absolutely stunning. It's lovely. Can you actually stop, so I can look at the lighting? Oh, yes, I know. Hi! Okay, alright. Just stay still. Can you just sit... lay in the center of the bed and lay still, and look up at the camera Hey, Justin, I feel like last time it was a little more shadowy, just a little more intimate. Not quite so... bright. More shadows. Can we do something about that? Yeah, sure. Hey, Kevin, can we look into that? Yeah, no problem. Hey, honey! How are you? - I'm fine. - Really? Yeah, I'm on Wilson Alright. Well, you know, you're almost here, so just look for the... there's no number on the building so it's a little tough. Just look for the big metal garage door. Okay... Okay. Alright. Just breathe. - Bye - Bye Fuck! Hey hey, we gotta go! Come. We gotta get Zoe out of makeup. Let's go, let's go. Cause Mal is almost... - Hey, guys! - Hey, how's it going? Hey, you're new. I'm Zoe. Hi, I'm Kevin. Very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Kevin. - Hey, how's it going? - You look amazing. You're like glowing. You look like a blond Audrey Hepburn or something. - Your skin looks beautiful. - Thank you! Thank you! Exactly right! I can't believe I didn't say that before. - You look amazing. - Thank you! Alright, I wanna show you something? - Hey, how's it going? - How's it going? Good to see you. Alright. Ben gave me a war room. Since there's no space here? Look what he did. Since we don't have a trailer for you today, let's go in... so we can chat for a minute. What do you think? It's nice, right? Yeah. It's actually really nice. I know, it's kind of better than the actual room we had last time. I like it. He did a good job. Yeah. Definitely did a good job. So, how are you feeling, baby girl? Okay. You doing your breathing? I see you're drinking water, that's awesome. I know, I know! I'm nervous. I'm so fucking nervous. But it's all good, it's so good. You're gonna... you know, knock it out of the park like you always do. Can people just not, like mention anything? Nobody's gonna... you're taking lead. If you want to talk to people, you do. If you don't want to, you have this space to come to. That's why it's here. Okay? Look at the big comfy chair. It's for you! You know I don't sit. Alright, so... I'm gonna take care of you today. You know that, right? You need anything... at any moment... You come to me. Don't go to anybody else. Alright? I gotta go check on things. - I'll be back. - Okay. I love you. I love you. Hello! Something's wrong with this room. Are you talking about the walls? - That's part of it. - There's not art on the wall and stuff? Yeah! Where are the walls? Oh, oh, okay. I get it, So here's what's happening. Remember the broadcast deal we talked about? Just to go over this again, for the broadcast deal, we have to have the part of the love scene that was filmed with nudity, It's sort of doing a PG-13 version of the love scene. So basically, everything we have right now before they get in bed is perfect. Everything after they get out of bed, perfect. We only need to re-shoot the part... the one spot from up here. They're never actually gonna get to the point of the love scene where they take it off. - It's not cable. - Okay. Alright. It's not cable. This bed needs... some light. Oh my gosh, I cannot wait to tell you about... I have been, luckily, really busy, for one thing... Copy that. Oh my gosh, it's hilarious... Ooh! Fuck! I'm sorry, I just want to let you know Mal's in makeup. Did you talk to everybody? Do they know what's going on? Yes. This girl, she's just filing her nails. Filing, filing, filing, so loud, like so intentionally, trying to just ruin my moment. - It's weird. - Yeah. And I finally looked at her and I said, "Susan, if you do not stop filing your fingernails right now, I'm gonna walk over there and stab you with your fingernail filer. " I mean, the counselor wasn't too jazzed about that but it was a real moment. And what's weird is she came up to me afterwards, and gave me this hug and said, "Thank you. You know, nobody has ever stood up to me in my life, ever. I really respect you for that. " - That's great. - Yeah. Thanks. She's one of the few that made it. You know, through the program, and... - Hi - Hi. - How are ya feelin'? - Fine, good. So happy to see you here. I'm truly grateful. - You look beautiful - Thank you. - Alex, well done! - Thanks! Great palette to start with, though. You're sweet. You can look at me. It's gonna be a fine day. I know it's gonna be hard, but we can all do it. - Mm hmm. - Okay? - See you in a few minutes. - Okay. Anyway, Susan and I actually still keep in touch through email, so... it's how I know that she's on the good path, you know? What's the ETA Da Silva, Mal's out in five. May the blessing of light be upon you. Light on the outside, light on the inside. - Hey everyone! - Hey Zoe! How's it going? Nice to meet you, I'm Zoe. I don't know what's gonna happen when Mal comes out. I have no idea. She was supposed to still be in the war room. So I had some sort of control over this. I don't know what's gonna happen. It was the best time ever? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I bet. That's really nice. Hi beauty! Here you go. It's only one shot. We'll finish in like half a day. - Hey! - You're out here? I didn't know you were out of makeup! Why didn't you say something? It's not a big deal. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you so much for coming. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. Yeah, of course! Good to be back. - So Zoe's already on set. - I noticed... Let's just... Let's just move in slowly, shall we? Good? Yeah. Mm hmm. Alright guys, let's get to first positions, please? First positions everyone! Zoe, to your mark on the bed, please? - That's interesting. - Zoe. - I mean... - Zoe. So let me just take you this way for a second? War room! Kara, I don't even know why you brought me in here. - I brought you in... - I'm an actress, she's an actress. I've seen her many times before, just like I deal with every other actor, I can go out there, and we can just do this thing... Zoe, that's not!... We know that you are not at your optimum, performance-wise, unless this big wall, this big wall that you've just put up is down. I understand why the wall is up. Because you need to protect yourself. However, you will not be able to perform with that wall up. And you know how important this beat is in the movie! Right? Hi. - How are ya? - Good. - Good to see you. - It's really good to see you. And I just wanted to come over and tell you that... I admire your work, and feel really lucky to have you as a part of this production. Thanks. I'm glad someone feels that way. We all feel that way. I want you to know, everyone... Yeah. I wouldn't go that far. You know, everyone... deals with broken hearts in their own way. What did you say? Sometimes it takes time to heal. Things take time. It's really good to see you. You're gonna be great. Let me know if you need anything. All we're doing now is a rehearsal. I just want to see that you guys can be in the same space. Okay. I will gather myself and I will go out there, and let the wall down and open myself up to all the hell that I've been through... again! You never know if something good can come out of this day. If you just stay open, it's possible that you might that you were not expecting when you woke up this morning. Enough said. Just give me a second then, and I will go on and do that for you. Alright. Rehearsal's up! It's like a cannon went off somewhere that I just missed out on. Does anybody actually know what just happened? 'Cause unless I know something, I don't know how to help you and I want - so - much to help you guys figure out how to get through this day for all of us. Did something happen that I didn't see? Did somebody on the crew upset you, did somebody say something... Okay. Okay. Okay. You got any ideas? If everyone's open to it, I'd like to try to unify energies here because, ultimately we all came to finish this beautiful project that we started. Zoe, will you please give me your hand? Thank you so much. Mal, can I have your hand, please? Create some synergy in the room. Everyone breathe with me. Is this a church thing, or like... Sounds like it's the beginning of a Saint Anne event. This is a little energy coherence in the center of the room. Thank you, Hasslers! Zoe, will you tell Mal one thing that you admire about her? She's a really talented actress. Mal, will you tell Zoe something? Zoe, you are... the funniest person, ever. And kind. The girl can throw a football. A perfect spiral, actually. There we go. Thank you! I admire you both immensely, and would love to see this come to fruition. Thank you. I'm gonna just let you guys take a sec, okay? - Thank you. - We'll get back in a minute. Just take a minute. I'm sorry, Zoe. I don't know what happened. But I think we can do this. Okay. Hey, can I get an ETA? How are you guys doin'? Do you need a couple... Okay, that is almost as weird as what just happened on the bed. You gotta roll with today. Come here. I want you to feel free to just start playing with it. We're gonna do a couple of takes, doesn't have to be just right the first time. - Right. - See what feels natural. - Okay. - Okay? We'll just keep going and then... - Exactly- - Whatever, so. Alright guys, we have time for one before we go to lunch, so let's get it in! Thanks, Ben. - Ready? - Yes. Let's get last looks in, please? This stuff in two years you're gonna find on someone's cat... Zoe? Zoe. Thanks, Alex. Also, these earrings are gonna be... If they wear my ears out, I'm not gonna be happy. I end up looking like Sister Rosaire. - Who? - I told you about her, I think. She was crazy. Crazy woman? Ladies? How ya feelin'? You ready to go for one? - Yeah. - That's awesome. Just get in first positions. You both look stunning. 27, take one Make sure to clear your left shoulder of the hair. Thank you. - Okay. - Okay. So, breathe in... Is this right, was I like this? I think the left arm was up a little bit... Like that? Was it pointing up? Shannon, was it pointing up? Her left arm? No, it's down. Okay. Cool. That's great. Yeah, but let's shift down here... I just gotta move them real quick. My nipple was just hanging out. Totally! She needs to move a little bit back, right? Kara? Kara, could you help me out for a second? Back up! A little bit more. She needs to back up a little, right? Yep. Mal needs to go back a little bit too. Okay, Mal, just back a little bit... Yes. So are Zoe and Mal in good positions now? Yeah, I'd like to see a little bit more of Zoe's arm, though, 'cause we don't... it looks like it's kind of stumpin' off there How's that? That's... that's good. Okay. Alright! Here we go, guys! Sorry, sorry. Alright everybody! Picture is up, picture is up. Hold on, I just need a second here. Awesome. Breathe in, Ellie and Jordan, And... action! Hey. I got pretty drunk last night. Yeah. I had to save you. You saved me? Yeah. I'm just checking in. Are you comfortable to try to go in for that first kiss? Mm hmm. Whenever you're ready. Ooh! Okay, looks like we busted a globe on that one. Perfect timing! Sorry guys. That's lunch, guys, sorry! That's okay, guys. We'll pick up where we left off right after lunch. It's really good. It's Taco Tuesday. Taco Tuesday! Alright, let's go. My brothers like to do, Packers, whatever, like Green Bay stuff uhm... - which is great. - Here, Mal. Go ahead. Nah! They get to watch us gyrating in lingerie, it's fine, go for it. - Gyrate in lingerie? - Uh huh. Lunch before the naked scene. Yeah, but I like it 'cause that's actually like real people eat, and then they get naked, so maybe if you can see like an outline people might be like, "I can relate to that person" 'cause theyre eating instead of like supermodels or whatever they do. - Thanks. - More relatable. Yeah. For sure. - Hello? - Hey, Zoe. - Hey, AJ. - Hey Zoe. - Hey Evan. - How's it going? Did you not get the message about the audition... No, yeah, I got that. But I can't 'cause I'm on set today, so I just figured you guys forgot. What do you mean, you're on set? You're on set where? We don't have you booked. No, just... Yeah, I didn't mean that. Just ADR for Caroline movie... ADR for the Caroline movie, I don't have you booked on anything. - Yeah, actually just, uhm... - We set up an audition for today. No no no, let me call you back in a minute. Okay, I really need you to make the audition. - Okay, yeah, right. - Just call me back! Yeah, it's going well. It's... Good! Were you able to make a meeting? I did, I did, I was able to push my call time a little bit and make a meeting in Burbank. Which was really, really good. Thank you for that advice. - I feel centered... - Oh, honey, of course. And focused, so yeah! Good, and I hear you're gonna be making a little trip soon, somewhere... Matt told you? East? Bet you're excited. Yeah! Yeah, I am. I'm really excited. I'm so happy for you. Yeah, it's great! I think it's gonna be really... Really good. - Yeah, be independent... - Yeah, you know, get out of town, experience a little bit of change, you know? Yeah. Uh huh. It's important. It's so exciting, and I just feel like it's such a good opportunity for your acting too, to get out there... Yeah, you know what, Stephanie? I'm sorry, can I just call you back when I get done? We just finished lunch, and I don't wanna be that person. No, it's fine, you don't gotta explain, it's fine. Alright, I love you, sweety. I'll talk to you soon. Okay. Alright. Bye Stephanie. If that light hadn't popped, we would have our master. Then we'd be on... so I know as soon as we get back, as soon as they get back, we're gonna be able to get it done. So I need you to stop worrying. Listen, I think we should all agree right now that next week we schedule a pick-up day because I don't want... Da Silva's gonna have to sacrifice all the lighting and we're not gonna be able to match anything. You know what? We don't have to match! What don't you understand... Kara, can I talk to you? Levi and Kieran, can you please FO, right now? I just got off the phone with Evan and AJ, and they're wondering what I'm doing here so I have a question for you, Kara. Is there a broadcast deal? No. What do you mean? Look at me! What... are you doing? Well, um... I don't know, I... I don't even remember what we were talking about. I'm sorry. - No, I, I... - It's just a lot - I want to let you know that I really appreciate sharing this space with you, I have to say, has been really lovely and important to me. Thank you... I do. 'Cause I feel like I'm often not seen. Oh, baby... I see you, Anne. I see you skipping around on the set, spreading happiness to everyone... I know, but I think that some people just think, I'm just like, I'm like 'nice Anne', like "go and see Anne, you know, and have her get your coffee" What-ever! And that's okay, I mean, I'm okay with that role but it's really important to me to be seen. Last time we were on set together, you know, it was just amazing. I mean, you keep it together! You're such a force. And today, especially. I need to be a force! You are a force! You're such a force. I do, well, I want to tell Kara that I've been reading all of these books trying to find a good love story, and I found one that I want to option Oh, wow! And I want to partner with her to direct it but I'm afraid, you know, that she won't respond well to that. I really appreciate, value her, and I need to do this. Look, you guys have been friends for... like fifteen years? Jesus. My god. Fifteen years. Really beautiful years, yeah. Really powerful. It's really amazing. You know, to have someone who's been able to see you grow for such a long time, I mean... Yeah. It's special. It's very special. Look at me! I... I lied. I did. I need you to understand something. I know you were inside it, but I had to watch you for three weeks crying, not eating, not sleeping. You know how many hours that is? Do you know how many nights I couldn't sleep listening to you? The only thing that you were consistent in, the only thing, you said it like a hundred times: "If only we could be in the same room. " Do you remember that? And once I realized this was not gonna pass, I did the only thing that I could do. So guess what? Now you're in the same room. And now I'm supposed to lie. What am I supposed to do now? I'm an honest person. People know me for that. How am I supposed to do this day? You didn't make this happen, I did! You didn't lie. You just have to make a choice now. And I'm gonna support you, no matter what. I did what I did. I can't undo it. I can't turn back time. It could be the worst thing I ever did. But it might be the best. But anything worth doing in life requires taking a risk. If you stay in your comfort zone you never get anywhere. I wanna be in it. I wanna be in your project. You got me in! Thank you so much. Do you mind if I share a quote with you? I didn't, I found it in part of my research for the movie, but I'd love to read it to you. Please. Love is largely self-generated, and falling in love is a process Stendhal calls crystallization. Before you fall in love, you see the other person as a bare branch. As you fall, you coat him or her with jeweled attractions, about 80% of your own making. That's... I don't know, it seemed pertinent. It seemed relevant. No, no, it's great. What does it mean to you? Well, that love is so interesting, you know? I think that 80% of what exists between two people is sort of put on and everything else in between is what's real, and idealization or anger or whatever it is, it's the thing in between, that thing that is absolutely inherent, that is the truth, and it's about going for that, that gut level thing. Does it mean anything to you? - Yes. - Okay. It's a lot, it's a lot to get into, but... love is... it's such a high. It is, yeah. It's such a high, and if you're someone who seeks highs, it's easy to... I think that's something to listen to and appreciate. Everybody's journey is their own. It's also very special. It only comes around once, maybe or very few times. Thank you for this conversation. I'm so sorry, I just need to check in on Kara. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. It's great to share this space with you, Anne. And just remember, just ask for what you want. It's worth it. It is. - Okay. Thank you. - Alright. I'll be here if they need me. - Hi. - Hi... I made your special tea. It's blue jasmine. You love blue jasmine. Oh, thank you sweetie. That's very sweet. I'm just gonna eat this first, thanks. I didn't eat lunch and my stomach's not... You should eat, of course! Listen, I know how important... I might need you to do this, later, if you don't mind I will, absolutely, absolutely. I'm like so stressed... I know how important this broadcast deal is to you. We have to get it today. We will! Okay? Mal's leaving to go to Chicago for a play for six months. I overheard her talking to her sponsor, and I confirmed it with her, and she said it's absolute, there's no way out of it. Well, a play in Chicago when? Next week. We've gotta pull it in. Okay. Okay, that's... you know what? That's terrible. It's absolutely fucking terrible! It's terrible! I don't even know what to do with that. Hey Zoe. My god, are you okay? You okay? Is this like the last time? Okay, we got this. It's getting worse. Yeah. Through your nose. Try it. Come on. Hey! She's just having a moment. - I got this, I know this... - Just a second, okay? Can I just... thank you so much. Hey sweetheart. What can I do for you? Do you wanna... Let's open you up, okay? Shhh. Okay. Cool water, blue skies... Clear blue skies. Nice fluffy clouds. Yeah babe. What happened? She's having a little trouble breathing. If you could get some water, okay? I'll be right back, sweetheart! Okay. Keep an eye on her. Oooh... Kara! Holy cow! Oh my god! What are we gonna do? Zoe's having a nervous breakdown. We haven't gotten a shot all day. They're acting like complete idiots! What are you doing right now? Oh, it feels good. Are you listening to me right now? You know what? We're so done. Ow! Oh! Aah! You need to get it together. You need to get it... together! I'm serious! Why are you laughing at me? Did you just clap in my face? What are you laughing at? Get it together! I don't know what to do. You're the leader, the ship's sinking, Get it together! I'm not kidding! I'm gonna be out there and you're gonna tell me what to do. I'm waiting for you! Just you and me, Zoe, okay? I'm not leaving till you're okay, alright? I'm not gonna leave. I'm not going to leave, Zoe, alright? Now, just look at me. Look at me and breathe. I can't open my hands, I can't. I really can't. You can. You really can. Give me your hands. There you go! That's it, that's it. You got this. You got this. Stay with me. Okay. You can do it. Just you and me. Just like before. - Sweety,... - Come with me. What happened? I'll tell you right now, what happened. - Anne told me you... - Just listen to me, please. Okay. Mal just kissed me. - Well, that sounds... - So I'm wondering right now, She is a really good actress. And I don't know if she's playing... I don't know if Mal is being kissing Zoe as Mal, or if Mal is being Jordan kissing Ellie to get through this day. Okay, you're making yourself sick... - Because I know... - Okay, alright. There is no way that Mal as anybody, whether it's herself or Jordan, There is no way she's gonna kiss you unless Mal wanted to kiss you. I am telling you that right now. There's no fucking way. Everyone, we're back in! She kissed you! We're back in from lunch. I mean, isn't that amazing? Alright, so let's tie this down, and like put a little 250 there to soften it up. I don't know what to do. We need to get them out here now. We gotta get going. I know, I know, we gotta get this today. We're not gonna make this day if people keep hiding in rooms all day. Look, think about this. Where did you first fall in love? In the movie. In the love scene. I saw it! We all saw it. You were right there, and you switched from Ellie to Zoe and she switched from Jordan to Mal at the same fucking time! And I got that, and I can't tell you how many times I watched it! Okay. Just can you... Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I know we talked about this, we weren't gonna get emotional, but listen. I want you to at least try for your happy ending. Hey, does anyone have eyes on Mal? Mal, does anyone have eyes on Mal? I want you to go out there, and I want you to get in bed with the love of your life, and just take a shot at a happy ending. Just try, okay? Just try. Can you just please try? Alright, guys. Let's get ready to go for a take! Picture is up. Rolling, rolling. Roll sound. Roll camera. Set. Action. I got really drunk last night. - Yeah, you did. - Yeah. How's your head? Same. I saved you, you know. PR guys? All over you. And, cut. That's a cut. That's amazing. We moved on? Yeah, moving on. We are moving on. Thank god. Alright, so Mal and Zoe, you guys can take 15. We're gonna reset and move in for coverage. - Well done! - It was beautiful! - I know. - Fantastic! Nice job guys, nice job ladies. Yeah, that was the first successful shot... Hey, shh, shh! Golly! Fantastic job, well done ladies! So just try to relax for a few minutes, okay? Okay, I have a confession to make. Okay. Remember that song from last summer? That we were like, obsessed with? That song was stuck in my head like the entire time we were doing that. It's like you know, when you get a song stuck in your head and it's like argh! When Frank and Jess came over? Yeah! So good. Stupid. So good. I almost lost it a few times. - I'll find it. - You have it? Yeah. That was it, that was the one! So pick it up, pick it up Sorry. Do you need a minute? Zoe, Look. I'm sorry. - Hon, look at me. - I don't know. Don't do that, please. Is that why you... Oh! Zoe, I wanna have this conversation, I really do, but does it... You know, actually? I came here today excited to see you, nervous to see you, and you know what? Now that I'm with you, right now, and you're having moments of fun with me, I'm actually standing right here, outside of myself, protecting myself and finding myself being really angry. And I have no idea why you walked out and gave me no explanation. So you know, I really want you to start talking right now. And give me the explanation that I deserve. Zoe... As a good fucking person. Who loves you. You really wanna do this here? Yeah, I do. Because I deserve that. Okay! Okay. You're right. Fresh out of rehab, I was vulnerable and... I wasn't vulnerable, just because I didn't go to rehab? Just listen, you want an explanation, are you gonna listen? You knew going into this who you were going into it with. You knew you were going into it with an addict. That's who I am, okay? It's taken me a long time to come to terms with that, but that's who I am. So it's my fault? - No, listen. - It's my fault. You want me to talk, or you want me to stop talking? Part of the recovery process is really learning to know oneself, and... Honestly, I respect you and Stephanie and whatever your thing is, but like when you push me out and make me the bad guy, how am I really supposed to react? - Okay... - This is so unfair! - That is so selfish! - Yeah? - Yeah, it is, it's fucking selfish! - You wanna talk about selfish? You were pulling away. I saw it. I saw it. I was watching it happening. - You were... - I was pulling away? - Yeah, you were pulling away. - Give me an example right now! Tell me right now! Tell me right now! Okay. You were backing out of the relationship Last party we went to together... Are you talking about the premiere? When you left me? You let that producer just pull you away. I understand, now listen, I understand! You're comparing a physical thing... You let it happen! You just walked away. And you know what? It's just an analogy of our fucking rela... It's always about you! You're so, so selfish. Yeah? You're the most selfish person I've ever met. Did you see that? - I did see it. - Did you? Aah! - The chemistry... - Alright now, calm down. Watch out for these cords. I don't know why they're still here! Gonna get the love scene... You just don't fuckin' listen! - You did that to me! - No. Yes! You're the one that pulled away from me, And I'm so sick of... You know what, I tried to fucking... What is going on here? What is wrong with you two? Honestly, this really has nothing to do with you guys. Can you please, I'm sorry Anne, but like Kara and Anne, please fuck off right now! Can you just go? Please go. No, you know what, I can't just go, Mal. I really can't just go. Is this love, or is this not love? Do you love her? Are you in love, or are you not in love? Kara, can we please not do this right now? This is really inappropriate. Are you in love with Mal? Zoe. Not right now. Are you in love with Mal? Mal, are you in love with Zoe? I just need to know. This is none of your fucking business. No! Is this love, or is this not love? This is a conversation between myself and Zoe, Go home! We're gonna pack your stuff. The day is done. You packed your stuff. We are done! What about the broadcast deal? We all need to come together here! You know what? There is no broadcast deal. I made it up, I made it up so that you two could magically get back together and I could actually feel that true love really does exist! Because I wanted true love to actually fucking win out just once! Aaargh! You know what, Kara? You really need to go now. Now you really need to go. You really need to go. - Do I really need to go? - You really need to go! Get out, get out! Grow up! Aaah! Kieran, we're wrapped. We're going home. For the day. Just wrap it. Wrap wrap wrap, done done done. Everybody goes home. Sorry guys! Everybody's going home. Alright guys, I guess that's a wrap for tonight. Just make it safe, alright? And we'll finish in the morning. You want the truth, Zoe? You want the fucking truth? I got scared that you were just gonna leave me! You had one foot out the door, and I got fucking scared! And you know what that feels like? To be left? Yeah, you do actually, because you know what? In reality Mal, you turned into your mother, and I turned into you, so yeah, I actually know how you feel! Because you turned into your mom and you left me, so you know what? Congratulations. You've turned into the person that you hate the most. Fuck - you! Yeah, fuck you! Fuck you! Worst decision of my life! I am so deeply, deeply disappointed. Why didn't you tell me the truth? I've been your partner in this for 15 years. I think you should have enough love for me to tell me what's going on! Mal, I didn't mean to say the stuff about your mom, I'm sorry! I promised I would never do that! I'm sorry Mal! You said it, you said it! Mal, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to say that about your mom! I really didn't, I'm sorry I said something I didn't even mean. Zoe! You need to leave. Just go away! Mal, can you please come out of the bathroom and talk to me, Mal? No! No, no no, no, you know what? You know what? Zoe? This is fucking over. It's over, okay! It's too far... That's it? That's it, really? Really? Mal, please come out of the bathroom and talk to me! You're my family, Mal! You're all I care about! Please don't do this to me! And please don't do this to yourself! Please! I really love you. And I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to make you feel this way. We can't hurt each other like this anymore! Okay, Zoe? It's too much! It's too much! And I can't, I can't do it! I can't! Hello? Hey, Stephanie. It's Zoe. Yeah, just letting you know, If you could just come get Mal, she really probably needs you but I gotta go, so I'll talk to you later. Okay. I'm on my way. I love you so deeply... and I know it's ridiculous, but I'm so full of it! I'm so full of it for you, and I can't keep it inside anymore. But I want you to see me. I want you to tell me the truth. I want to be creative partners with you. You think that I don't see you? Is that what you think? God, you are amazing! I'm your biggest fan! - See you guys. - Good night! My god, Zoe!
