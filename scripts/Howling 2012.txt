How did it start? The victim was sitting in the car when he suddenly caught on fire. Suddenly? Was it a suicide? We're looking into the cause. The witness didn't see any accelerant. The witness was a homeless man and very drunk. He said the victim drank something. Maybe that was an accelerant. What about a cell phone? According to the lab, it wasn't a cell battery explosion. Any other inflammables? There were a burnt gas burner and a plastic bottle. We aren't sure if there was any accelerant in the bottle. Search if there's a will. Yes, sir. Do you have an ID on the body? No. Everything was burnt to a crisp. It'll take some time. - What's that? - This? - It looks like a belt buckle. - A belt buckle? Any words from Missing Persons? No. Hey, Sang-gill Did you run the license plate? It's an unregistered vehicle. The car's so burnt we can't get any fingerprints. Hello. Hi, Eun-young. Good. You came. Say hello to Detective Jo. Hello, sir. I'm Eun-young Cha. Nice to meet you. He's your superior. Support him well. Nice to meet you. You were a patrol officer? You don't wanna ride your motorcycle no more? She worked as a detective briefly. Take good care of her. I don't do babysitting. Sir. Where should I start? Wait outside. Pardon? There's nothing here for you. Wait outside. This is a scene of fire. I'm all burnt inside too. You know you like it. What? You wanted a partner. And she's cute. If you think she's cute, you take her. Hey. You know what we need? We don't need high-tech tools. We need a touch of a woman. Idiot. Shut up! There's the promotion situation and difficult personality issue. Try your best to fit in. Yes sir. If you need to, amuse him with your charm. Though you don't seem like the type. Did you find me? Are you almost done? Almost. This case. You take it. What? The other team is busy with other investigations. Please take the case. No way. What? I said no. And I don't want the girl either. What am I to this team? A housekeeper? Hey. Wait. I understand we are classmates. But I'm your superior in front of the team. You want me to clean up a simple drop and dead case? And there's the woman cop thing too. Everybody's busy. As a senior, you should help the young ones. Help me too. I need that promotion. Fine. Next time, I'll give you a big case. I promise. OK? You are divorced? You're only thirty years old. Why did you break up? We had issues over my work. What man likes his wife working night shifts? Why do you wanna do this again? I love working those night shifts. Any kids? None, sir. Good. You know all this chasing after criminals. It's all bullshit. Even if we lock them up, there are still crimes. These kids need to be disciplined from the beginning. Yeah? You found him? You go first. Let go! Let go of me! You missed school to play in the gaming center? You little bastard! Why do you think I work so hard? - You little shit! - Fuck! You can't hit me! What kind of father hits his kids? Fuck. I didn't tell you to work! What, you little shit? What did you just say? You suck! Shit! Stop it! Why do you think I put up with all this shit? You screw up everything. Sir! Sir, please! - Let go! - Please stop! Fuck! You stop there! Stop! Stop! Where's the coroner? He had to go so he left the record. Forget what you saw earlier. He's a good kid. Just going through puberty. Any fingerprints? None, sir. The coroner found a big dog bite on the thigh. A dog? That's a deep wound. And he found drugs in the urine. Drugs? It's a new street drug called Haba. Heard it's very addictive. He was a druggie. He was high when he set himself on fire? Doesn't it look odd to be a suicide? Odd? If it was a self-immolation, accelerant would've dripped down so lower half should've burnt more. But this one doesn't look it. You studied a little forensics? All dead bodies look odd. Can you work with it? This is really burnt. I don't know if I can get anything. Do your best. There's no other way to ID the body. OK. I'll try. Since when did homicide hire based on looks? She's too good looking to be a cop. We're in the service business too. As a public servant, what's good is good. You know? Please get that data. We need to notify the family and close the case. I'm analyzing the cause of death. Go report. This is a reenactment of the case. The fire started from the belt? The point is the belt buckle. Look here. You see this tar on the belt? We found Benzoyl peroxide, which is highly flammable. How did the fire start? It's like a time bomb. This is a device inside the buckle. This is the timer and this is the trigger. When the timer goes off, the trigger ignites the benzoyl peroxide powder, which instantly burns the belt. What? This is a homicide? - We got the search warrant. - What? - Bring a camera and the kit. - Yes, sir. We're back. You going out? Yes. It really sucks. Where were you? You two having fun? Yeah. We had a nice date. Wow. Date! So jealous. Eun-young. Clean this place before we get back. Make copies of paperwork. This is not our case. Are you serious? We are a team. There's no yours or mine. I didn't hear a "yes". Yes, sir. Get it straight. She's new. Be nice. Hey, Sang-gil. What did the lab say? Is it a suicide? They don't have the result yet. It might take a while. I thought you went for the final report. He said the autopsy has been postponed. So, what's the name of the motel? De Gala"??? OK. Got it. Sir. Aren't you going to report to the captain? I'm solving this case. Reporting can wait. The results are out. We should report. If we report now, do you think they'll let me have the case? They see criminals as points. Do you know how many points you get for a felony murder? But we should share the info. The suspect seems intelligent. You wear belts you get from strangers? An acquaintance gave him that belt and he's the killer. A criminal who advertises his identity is not smart. Once we ID the body, we'll find our killer. I don't know if that will be so easy. Yo! It's not easy for you. We know the drugs. It's new. There can't be too many dealers. You wanna stay and make copies? Just follow me. Is that him? - Yes. - Yes. You will fucking fly high on these. Is the club packed? Yo, take this. Watch them. I'll go with you. And do what? Stay here. Hey man, how's it going? Yeah. Let's catch up soon. Hey. Mira! What're you doing here? Long time no see! What's that? Who are you? You don't remember? I'm... a cop! Fucking let go. Fuck! Sir! Get his legs! - Fuck! - Stay still! Shit Stay still! - Drop the knife! - Let go! Drop the knife! Fuck You! - Drop it! I will fire. Fucking shoot him. Shoot him. Hurry! - Shoot him! - Don't shoot! - Shoot him! - Don't shoot! Shit! Sir! Are you alright? Sir! You said you sold the drugs. You little fuck! But you don't know the name or number? You want me to believe that? I really don't. I only sold them at the club on the weekend. You must've called to meet him. You think I'm fucking stupid? What the fuck! You can't hit me. You're a cop! This is a forcible interrogation. Record this. - Hurry! - You do that. You still feel OK, huh? It's because it was an indirect hit. Let's finish this for good. I normally don't try this hard but... Let's see if you feel this alright this time. I got the address. Go home and give me the keys. I'm sorry. I won't make another mistake. I said go home. Sir, I'll do it. Sir. You understand this was a firearm accident. If you don't the strength, at least shoot at the target. How can I trust you now? Just go back to riding motorcycle. If you can't help, at least don't get in the way. Is it straight? Yes. Go straight. Shit! Yes. What're you doing? You following me? I was worried. You're not well because of me. Are you shitting me? Go home now! Then should I go to the office? What? Now we have the victim's address. We can report. What? Yo! Yo... Why did you turn the light on? What? Don't you know anything? Sorry. Where did you learn to investigate? Just turn it back on. You already turned it on. He said it wasn't a regular learning center. Did that bastard lie? What's this? An image club? A druggie and a perverted pimp. The victim was dirtier. No one knows about this tenant. The name's fake too. Who's this guy? A ghost? Are you tired already? No, sir. Then why are you so quiet? Is questioning boring you? I never thought that. Then what's with the long face? You had that look at the health equipment store too. The owner seemed gay. You think I enjoy talking to gay guys? It's our loss if they don't talk. If you keep that up, who'd talk to you? What's a woman's weapon? Flirt if you need to. Don't you know the basics of being a detective? We don't sit around and study forensics. We do legwork to solve a crime. If you're gonna be somber, quit now. Why are you standing there? Did I upset you, ma'am? Come talk to my face. Say it if you have something. I'm sorry. The extra memory card was slightly less burnt. Was this recorded from the cell? It might be a 6mm camcorder. Looks like porn. The victim might be one of the girls from the shop. It's from 5 years ago Who'd carry it around for so long? What? Is that all? Can't you get his face? This is all I could retrieve. There were more with different girls. Here are the screenshots. The camera is fixed. It might have been done covertly. You familiar with porn? Play it again. I asked for the phone number not pictures. We need the fingerprints. Go to the office and fetch the kit. - Sir. - What? Let's report. What? I think we need backup. I even took a shot from you. What're you saying? Frankly, I want this case too. This is a great case for a detective. But we shouldn't proceed further without help. There's the belt thing. And kids are involved too. Before it gets too late, please ask for backup. Young-chul got promoted. Do you think anyone care that you go by the book? If you want the case badly, solve the crime. That's what a real detective would do. Congrats to Young-chul! Cheers! Congratulations Inspector! You better not forget me. I'm still with the team. I love you man. - Detective Jo is here. - Yeah? Mind your words in front of Sang-gil. He got passed over for a promotion. - Yes sir. - Sure. Drink up. Sorry, we're late. Come in. You made it. Congrats! Congratulations. Thanks guys. Haven't seen you in a while. Is there any progress? What? We don't even have an ID on the body. I meant you two. Any words from the lab? What's taking them so long? It's coming soon. Here. What's this? It's nothing. Just a little piece of my mind. Open it. Open it up. It's a belt. It's leather! Thanks man. Look at that shiny buckle. Now that you'll be sitting a lot, don't let your belly pop out. Remember where you began. Alrighty then. Keep that waist slim. Mr. Jo. You became so sentimental. Maybe a woman's touch is working. I should change. I7 Happiness seems bigger When it's far away I7 Look up when you feel alone I7 Because you're not alone I7 Even if the rain falls or wind blows I7 The Sun will always shine afterward I7 When you want to cry... How's working with a girl? It's fucking good. Seriously? It's electrifying My body shakes all over. I7 It feels like a shot wound I7 My heart aches so much I7 I try to stop it with my two hands You OK? The dude is old-fashioned. He hates watching woman working outside the home. It would be hard for you. J7 Please Help me please So just hang in there. As soon as I get assigned a team I'll help you out. You know it's important who you learn it from. Eu n-you I19 Let's dance. I don't dance. What's wrong honey? Be cool. Detective Goo. If you want to be treated like a superior, quietly remove this hand. Before I humiliate your ass. I7 I yelled out your name from behind I7 My heart bleeds... Help me please Dad, be quiet. You're waking up everyone. Ji-yeon. Where's your brother? He went out because you drank again. Be quiet and go to sleep. She's waiting outside. I'm sorry about my dad. It's alright. You should get to bed soon. - I'll see you later. - OK. Thank you again. It's nothing. I guess your mom went out. She doesn't live with us. They separated a long ago. I'm so happy. You don't have to work today. That almost sounds like you want me to quit. If I ask you to quit, will you? Stop. It tickles. I can't deal with this anymore. We're through. - Hubby Hi baby. You're still awake? Daddy, when are you coming home? I'm on my way. Did you get the doll? Oh no! Daddy forgot. Really? You promised! Are you lVi"97 Daddy? What's wrong? - Daddy! - What's that? - What's wrong? Honey? - Daddy? I can't believe Detective Jo didn't report. I obviously thought he did. The point system is the problem. Asshole. We got an ID. His name is Sang-hoon Nam. He has a record for illegal drugs and prostitution of minors. The belt case victim is also drugged. Both have the same bite mark. There might be a connection. If this is serial, it's serious. Sir. What? The captain found out. Hello sir. What's this? Who do you think you are? Is this why you wanted to work here? You're just a beginner. Is this how you want to get ahead? Because of someone like you, we all get chewed out. Forget her. Where's Sang-gil? Hey. Sang-gil Jo. How could you do this to me? Why didn't you report? If it's out of your capability, you should at least be honest. And you brought her into this mess. I'm sorry. I was too ambitious. They fixed the interior for prostitution. How could you not have known? We manage over 10 buildings. How can we check every room? Our chairman is the founder of Myung-in Welfare Foundation. If he knew, do you think he would've ignored it? Did you get any fingerprints? How did you ruin all the fingerprints? This won't be easy. We've done our research. And found some leads. We got an ID on the belt victim. This is a picture from Sang-hoon Nam's place. The guy next to Nam is the victim of belt case. Name's Kyung-il Oh. We had a composite sketch and matched it with Nam's call history. Same person, right? Two victims knew each other? What about the other two? They're not on the call history. We're still looking. That's so strange. How could a rabid dog bite two victims one after another? Oh died from a time bomb belt. Both had prostitution charges and same bite mark. It looks like a serial killer. No way. Methods are completely different. There's this weird thing. What killed Nam... might be a wolf. A wolf? The fur found on the body. It didn't match any of the large dogs. The fur and the teeth mark could be from a wolf. Did a wolf escape from a zoo? In the middle of Seoul? It's probably a trained dog. Should we question dog trainers? Yes, but we just might find the killer from the victims' acquaintances. Hey Sang-Q... Because close friends usually give belts as gifts. Young-chul heads this case from now on. Yes. Sang-gil's team. Find about that wolf or whatever. Go enjoy the zoo. I called the zoo and the lost and found pet center. Aren't you a nice one? What? We did all the hard work for someone else to take credit. I think it's worth digging. What is? We don't know what it is, but that animal killed human. If we follow the dog, we might find some leads. Follow a rabid dog? Do we work for public health department? If we have the time, we should be asking around more. Then why didn't you say it earlier to the captain? And then what? We have our limits. We can't stakeout for days and nights or arrest criminals. We just go and follow a dog. Sir. You hate working with me that much? What? Do what you want. I'll investigate on my own. You really believe you're at a disadvantage because you're working with a woman? Aren't you feisty? How did you hold back all this time? Huh? Good boy. Come here. We're not allowed to train dogs to attack human. We do train dogs to overpower criminals Which is very difficult. Can you train a wolf to do that? I don't think you can train wild animals like wolves. Hey! Can you show these guys? Yes. We need a helper. Can I help? No. A woman might not work. We need someone who looks like a crook. Detective, why don't you try? What? Steady. Steady. It's called an IPO training, which is detention drills. If the criminal makes a move, the dog will bite. Can all dog trainers train such drills? No, you need someone with at least a class A license. Stop! Stop this! Get this dog outta here. You're so scared of dogs. Dogs would never bite human. I believed that until I was bitten I was six. Which large dog is closest to a wolf? In fact, there's a dog that's half wolf. It's not an official breed. It's called a wolf dog. It's a hybrid of a wolf and a dog. Can a wolf and a dog... do it? They're both canines. Can you train a wolf dog? Because they're half wolf, I heard they're excellent. Especially the memory and sense of smell. They're still wild so it'll be hard to train. There have been success cases in other countries. Ever since it was a pup, the trainer took care of it like his own. You see training is all about love and bonding. Is there any wolf dog in Korea? Probably not. Unless someone smuggled it. There's this dog-crazy guy. Why dOn't you try him? Another place? I think the owner went out. I'll stay here. You go look around. Isn't that a wolf dog? That's a just a wolf. What's a wolf doing here? Find anything? This really looks like a wolf dog. You're finally hallucinating. What's this? That's not a wolf or a dog. I think you might be right. Who are you? - You live here? - Yes, why? I'm detective Jo. Let's have a talk. About what? Hey stop! Yo! Hey stop! Stop! Get out of the car! Turn off the engine! Turn off the engine! I'm gonna kill you Stop the car. Fucker! Stop the car! Move! Stop! Shoot him! Shit! I'm not lying! I bred it for dog fighting. You sure? That dog is mostly wolf. It's not even trainable. How can I make it kill someone? Where did you sell the other one? How can I remember? I sold it when it was a pup. Call the office. Let's put him in for dog fighting, illegal drugs, attempted murder of an officer. Yes sir. He's a thug. Name's Tae-sik Min. Tae-sik Min? Is he here? Yes. This is him. What's Min-jung doing here? You know the girl too? She's Min's ex. How's the puppy search going? It's gOif19... We have it. Have what? The suspect. Kyung-soo, brief them. Teammates should cooperate. The tattooed guy from Oh's cell. He looked like a thug so we searched dog fighting thugs. You know how some thugs gamble on dog fights. And there he was. It's him. Tae-sik Min. Using the video clips, burn victim Oh blackmailed dog bite victim Nam. So Min killed them both. Did you get Min's whereabouts? No. He's been wanted by the police for a while. Min's involved in some type of contract business. Bring the kit. Yes. Give me a sec. I don't think they know about the girl yet. Hurry and check. If you got everything, let's go. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Eu n-you I19 Why did we pick you? Are you a decoration? What do you mean? Why haven't you organized team's expenses? Everybody's busy. The team's busywork is yours. You think we're playing around? Our investigation is also hectic. I'll do it when I get the time. You don't get it, do you? Get up. Who fucked up the initial investigation? Do what you're paid to do and then go chase dogs. I didn't come here to do busywork. Why don't you just hire a maid? What? You insane? You don't care anymore, do you? Yo. Stop barking and go. Dog investigation is serious stuff too. What? - What's with you? - What? Why are you mad? Thought you're busy! So just go! Let's go man. I guess she grew on you. Guess she's good. Don't know what she's good at. I'm sick of your jokes. I'm not joking. You two are both single. It's all good. Fucker! What's wrong? You bastard! Beat me! Shit! Let me go! I'm sorry. I should've held back... If you want to stay here, you better stay inside the lines. If you try to win over a guy, you'll be quietly removed. I got Min-jung Song's whereabouts. Oh yeah? Then let's stake out. They lived together. He'll come to visit. Let's ask for backup. From now on... You just breathe and do as I say. Anything new? It's about the same as yesterday. Any Sign of Song? No. What happened to your face? Did you fight with Detective Goo again? That's too harsh. You're an elder. The fucker really hit me. My son. Now I know why people stopped having kids and raise dogs. Dogs don't hurt your feelings. It's your turn. Go home. I'm alright. We don't know when she'll show up. Go home. Change clothes. Your family will be worried. I don't have anybody. Where are your parents? They passed away when I was young. What about other family? I have none. The only family I had was my ex-husband. What's that? I'm gonna be done in the morning so don't take any appointments. No. - I'll call you. - OK. I think that's Song. Isn't that Min? So including Min, there's three? Yes. Good job. You haven't lost your touch. I knew dog investigation was important. What's with your face? - I got drunk and fell. - Geez, man. Ki-nam and I will block the back alley. You guys go to the front. Yes sir. Eu n-you ng. You stay here Why? What if you get hurt? How can I work this job if I'm scared to get hurt? Please let me go. He said stay. Captain... Let's bring her. Someone's gotta open the door. Who is it? Gas Utility Service. The owner's not here. I just need to check the gas meter. Everybody stay put! - Who are you? - We're cops. Just bring Min. Who the hell is Min? We know everything. Is he inside? Cuff them. - Put it down. - Said put it down! Put it down! Down! Stop right there! What's that? A killer dog once again killed a person. The victim was a woman in her thirties. She was attacked by a killer dog in front of her house. The police are looking for the killer dog in the nearby mountains. But the killer dog's whereabouts is still unknown. According to the National Crime Lab, the DNA shows the killer dog might be a wolf dog, a wolf and a dog hybrid. We should've checked... The guy Sang-gil was mistaken. He's Song's new boyfriend. Stupid fool. We wasted our time on the wrong guy. Did Song help blackmailing Min? We think so. Five years ago, these four ran child prostitution business. But Min's contract business flourished and he changed his attitude. So they tried to blackmail him with the old video clip. Until put on the wanted list, Min was an influential figure in the community. If people knew about Min's dirty past, it would've looked bad. But this dog looks like well-trained. Don't let the trainers off the hook yet. We've checked. We're sure Min is the killer. We went to his old vacation home and found the wolf dog's fur. Why would a thug use a dog instead of a knife? Dogs can't talk. If the killer denies, it'll get complicated. In order to prove his guilt, we need to catch that dog. You knew all that and managed to mess it up? It's all out in the media. What're you gonna do now? I won't make another mistake. Shut up. Listen up. From now on, whoever catches him, gets all the credit. So move. Yes sir. What about Eun-young? She has broken ribs. She's lucky her stomach didn't rupture. Shit. Why did we get a woman cop? When she comes back, tell her to stay in. I don't think she fits in here. Why don't we just get rid of her? Sorry. What're you doing? What's with the bandage? Everybody's busy I should help. Don't even think about it. I'm fine. We called for backup. What? We will catch Min. You just get better and stay in the office. Sir! Why did you come out? We should further investigate the trainers. Why? The dog attacked the victims' exact pressure points. It was highly trained. It would take a skillful trainer to do that. You think a thug is capable of doing that? They say training is all about bonding. You think someone so caring would order a dog to kill people? Young-chul already investigated all the dog trainers. Stop barking up the wrong tree and sit still. If you won't, I'll go on my own. Stay inside the lines or you'll be gone. Run! Can you train police dogs to attack? They're only trained for defense. Haba's your specialty. You know where to look. Who'd give such expensive drug to a dog? They get so high. They'll fight to death. - It's for expenses. - I can't do it. What would it take? Need a couple of more. No credit cards. I'll give you one more. It's my daughter's allowance. Give me the account. I've researched all the private trainers to police dog handlers. But there isn't anyone. Did I miss something? Police dog trainers: Missing and Deceased When did he pass away? Missing Deceased Missing Licenses IPO Class A license Myllng-ho Kang? He was my best friend in the force. He once tipped off an illegal dog fight. So we busted the arena. He took some of the confiscated dogs to train. He was a very gifted K-9 trainer. I'm not sure if there was a wolf dog. How did he pass away? Ladies and Gentlemen! Are you ready for an exciting game? Please cheer for the dogs fighting today... Medical History He jumped into the river. He had a daughter named Jin-joo. She ran away from home and got locked up in the psych ward. She had a severe drug addiction and was pregnant. Do you know where she went? It took a toll on him. He had a stroke, which left him paralyzed. Did the police find his body? No. In Kyung-kl area, there are 1' 6 women in their twenties hospitalized for drug addiction. Of those 16, women with male guardians who can't move well there are five. Jin-joo Kang. There's no Myung-ho or Jin-joo Kang here. Let's burn some money! Yellowie Yellowie! Kwang-ju Kwang-J"! Two hundred for Kwang-joo! Awesome! Jung-ah's father does use crutches... W? Do YOU ask? Is this him? It could be him... That's strange. Yesterday, someone showed me Jung-ah's picture and asked about her. Who did? Said he was a relative. Can I see Jung-ah right now? She went out with her dad few days ago. Great! Go! Go! This dog fighting is driving me nuts. You sure he's gonna show up? Let's move out. Just wait. What? Where are you? I have something urgent to tell you. I'm working. Later. Sir! Hello? Hello? Sir? We have three thousand! Fantastic! Come on, man. We have a new suspect Meet me here ASAP Put on a little smile. Act natural. It's the wrong tattoo. What the fuck! Let go! Why don't you pick up? Myllng-ho Kang! Myllng-ho Kang! Myllng-ho Kang! Open Up! Mr. Kang. Open the door! Mr. Kang. Open this door! Who are you? I'm detective Cha from Mapo police homicide. You're Myung-ho Kang? I came from your daughter's mental hospital. Please open this door. Are you alone? My partner is on his way. Open this door and talk to me. Don't shoot. Jil-poong won't attack without my order. If you care for your daughter, don't do this. Open this door. Or I'll have to shoot. Jung-ah! - Jung-ah!- Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang! Kang! Who are you? Who are you? What are you doing? Open up! You son of a bitch! Police! Shit! Open up! Fucker! It would take a skillful trainer to do that. You think a thug is capable of doing that? Daddy! Please open the door! Daddy! Daddy! Please get up! Untie me! It's so hot in here! Let me out! Daddy! It's so hot... Daddy... Eu n-you I19! Eun-young Cha! Daddy, I It's so hot! Sir! Eu n-you ng! What happened? Who's inside? - It's the killer's daughter. - What? Daddy! Heard it's an arson. What happened here? According to Eun-young someone set fire to kill Kang. Someone's trying to kill the suspect? Maybe someone from the victims' side tried to revenge. What about Min? We can't tie him to the fire. What should we do with Min? Someone else took the blame for him. We can't hold him much longer. Idiots. Thought you were sure about Min. It's my fault. I ruined my daughter's life. Give me the drugs! Give me the drugs! But! Will never forgive them. Please give it to me. I need it. Dogs must be killed by dogs. Give me the drugs! That's what they deserve. - It looks different. - It's an ace. A wolf dog. I bought a dog from him. It was lucky to get a wolf dog pup. Jil-poong! Attack! It will be difficult, but I'm going to train this dog. I'm betting my life on it. This doesn't feel right. Kang went after Oh, Nam, Song, and Min That's four. But there are five dummies in golf wear. And one woman's clothes. Isn't it weird that he prepared an extra? In his diary, he stole clothes for the smell of his victims. Maybe there's another target we couldn't find it. We couldn't find it. Sang-gil lost track in the fire. We have to catch that dog. What if it kills again? What did the doctor say? Kang is in critical condition. The daughter is in better condition. Guess he trained the dog with dummies. A police officer went murdering people. What was wrong with his daughter? She ran away from home in 9th grade. She was used in sex trafficking. By Min and the other three victims. She was found a year later. She was suffering severe mental distress from drug addiction. Also, she was pregnant and had STD. Kang's wife died from the shock. Those four ruined that little girl. Detective Jo! Yes! When Kang wakes up, question him about the arsonist with Young-chul. Yes. Captain. I'll question Kang with Eun-young. Wait. I'm letting her go. What do you mean? It's for everyone. It's good to catch a criminal. But a woman cop is burdensome. If she screwed up this time, what would've happened? The crew is not happy with her. Ever since she came, they don't feel like a team. But she's done OK so far Isn't that too harsh? I'm letting her go especially for you. Forget that. I'll question Kang with her. I looked every nursing home. It was really hard because she changed her name. Stupid. How was he able to videotape everything? You know it's all because of Oh. In his basement, there were the five. I found your golf glove there. Did you find the videotapes? I think Oh had it with him when he was killed in fire. That's good. I'm not sure how but there was a female cop. She seemed to know something. So? She came alone so I finished her off. You killed a cop too? I burned everything clean. Don't worry. Sir. This is not the amount we agreed. Let this one slip. My foundation is having a bit of financial problem. If this gets out, I'll have to skip town. No way man. Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang? Mr. Kang. Can you hear me? If you can, say something. Jung-ah... She's fine. Don't worry. We saved you two. Remember? Mr. Kang. Jil-poong's gone. Do you know where it might go? Sang-hoon Nam. Min-jung Song. You killed them with your dog. Right? Because of your daughter. What about Kyung-il Oh? You tried but failed? Who set your house on fire? Any guesses? There must be something. You must know him. He tried to kill Jung-ah. He's somehow related. Stop now. He might go into shock. Wait. Mr. Kang. Don't you want to catch whoever did this to you and your girl? No? Bae... Yong-sik... Yong-sik Bae? He killed himself under the influence of drugs. His name is Yong-sik Bae. He's the owner of health equipment store. He lives in the same building as the burn victim Oh. Why did he kill himself? He found out Kang got out alive and got scared. He had depression. In his will, he confessed to the belt case. Bae said he killed Oh? It was money problem. Bae lent Oh a lot of money, but Oh kept delaying repayment. Bae went into debt developing health equipments. But Oh kept ignoring him so Bae held a grudge. We found this in Bae's pocket. Kang might have taken these looking to kill Oh. I made this on my own. Try it. Wow! You really made this? Yes. You're awesome. You see here. It's a step counter. Take it. Try it from today. There's no better exercise than walking. Coincidentally, Kang and Bae both tried to kill Oh. Kang failed with the dog. So Bae killed Oh with a belt. They found out about each other while they both tried to kill Oh. So in the end, Bae killed Oh for Kang. It looks like Bae fixed his invention into a time bomb. This powder hydrogen peroxide. He put this to set it off. Benzoyl peroxide. Did you confirm with Kang? I couldn't talk for long. But he admitted to taking the pictures. So that's done. Good job guys... Finish the report within this week. Wrap it UP... Yes sir. But... Something doesn't feel right. Bae knew Jung-ah. What? At the ward, there was someone looking for Jung-Ah. I checked and it was Bae. If it was simply about killing Oh, how could he have known Jung-ah? You found out. It's weird that Oh would gladly take the belt. In Bae's will, they weren't in good terms. Sang-gil, let's just wrap it up. A cop is involved It's a sensitive matter. Stop making it worse. Just find the dog. It's getting crazy out there. Captain! Bae's suicide motive is weak. Why don't we investigate further? Sang-gil. You haven't told her? Now Kang's in custody. Min must be really happy. You are... being transferred. What do you mean? It just happened. You're going back to patrol soon. What's the reason? People here are uncomfortable with you. Also there's the teamwork problem. Is it because I didn't stay inside the lines? Eu n-you I19 As you know, it's hard even for a man to last here. Why do you want to overwork yourself? You're smart so you'll do well anywhere. What's the use in chasing criminals day after day? No spouse would tolerate it. You're missing the most important stuff. You're still young. Meet someone nice and start over. Why do I need to do that? If the teamwork is the problem, I will try to fit in. I'll do all the busywork. Yeah, what? Yes sir. Remember Min? The CEO of Tae-sin Construction? He's dead. I think he was attacked by that dog. He was at the motel in See-sak area. He was going to the parking lot when he was attacked. I'll report you with more details once I find some witnesses. Kang is in custody. What happened? I'm sorry, sir. I'll catch it as soon as possible. Shit! It's just one damn dog. Why did you let it loose? Sorry, sir. If we knew about this, we would've looked further. Shut up. Catch that damn dog in ten days. It's the chief's order! How can we catch it? We can't even find a glimpse of it. Jr!-poong doesn't act like a pet dog. Just as a wolf does, it follows me like a pan of the pack. Jung-ah and Jr!-poong are like brother and sister. Jil-poong accepts Jung-ah's childish behaviors. Sometimes, I feel as though Jil-poong knows Jung-ah's pain. I feel miserable that I raised Jr!-poong for revenge. Min is dead. He was killed by a dog. It's Jil-poong, right? How did you do it? You're lying here. HOW did it find Min? He remembered... I made him remember. It remembered? You made it remember? Yes. So the dog remembered Min. And found him on its own to revenge? Is that possible without your order? Shit. That dog can kill anyone as long as it remembers. There's one more. Isn't there? That target sent Bae to kill you. Right? It's true. Officer Kang. Do you want Jil-poong to kill that person too? I have a daughter too and I understand your anger. But you were a cop. Who's the next target? Talk to me. Mr. Kang! Don't you care about Jil-poong? Jil-poong has killed humans for you. Why would Jil-poong do that? It's because you gave him that much love. How could you use Jil-poong as a murder weapon? Is that why you raised it with love? If you have your revenge, you don't care if Jil-poong gets shot or left abandoned? You don't want that. Jil-poong is your family. Don't let Jil-poong commit more murders. We'll catch it alive. So tell us how. We'll find whoever did this to Jung-ah. So talk to us. - Mr. Chairman. - Yeah. The news is out. They couldn't stop the media. You need to hide. I'll arrange a boat. Do you recognize him? Remember anything? Sure. That weird bug picture. - That's Big Uncle. - Big Uncle? Do you know his name? He was really good to me. He gave me this shot. He told me that I'll get skinny and pretty. Then daddy won't hate me anymore and love me. Did you tell Big Uncle about your dad? Kang didn't talk till the end. Does he truly want Jil-poong to finish his revenge? We got no new leads. Is this where it ends? Why don't we track back from Oh's case? Maybe we missed something. We don't have enough time. The case will be closed in two days. Jil-poong is probably hunting right now. If I only knew who it is, I wanna follow Jil-poong. Jil-poong must know who it is. Why don't we follow? What? Let's lure him and follow. Jil-poong and Jung-ah were like brother and sister. We might be able to lure him with Jung-ah's stuff. A killer dog is loose and residents are worried about their safety. Three were victimized by this killer dog. The police and authorities are still searching. The police made a statement today. If found, the police will use guns. They could catch it alive. But the police made the decision based on residents' safety. Choi, Councilman and chairman of a welfare foundation, suspected of embezzlement and tax evasion Choi is missing. Police fears that he may have already left the country. And requested the Interpol for cooperation. Where were you? What're you doing? Thought we're gonna capture it. The order came from upstairs. We can't find the damn dog. Eun-young had a point. We're hanging the daughter's clothes near the house. Captain! You can't kill Jil-poong. I said the order came from upstairs. There's more to this case. It won't end by killing one dog. Kang won't say it, but there's another target. This person ordered Bae to kill Oh with the belt and set Kang's house on fire. But things got out of control so he killed off Bae. According to Jung-ah, this guy controlled all the victims. He's deeply involved with prostitution of minors. He's the one Oh blackmailed. He got scared his dirty past might get out. Thought the daughter's insane. You don't have any proof. So what? If Kang succeeded, Jil-poong is probably looking for him. Why don't we follow and see where it leads? Guess you're still in shock. You don't make any sense. The dog found Min. It's carrying out revenge for Kang. Eun-young can ride motorcycles. Let's try it. If it fails, kill it then. What's wrong with you? A cop murdered civilians. Let's not make this any worse. Shut up and go find the dog! Captain. It's not over. Why do you want to close it? The real victims here are children. We should find the person responsible. Are you the only detective here? Have you even cuffed anyone? Now that this might be my last chance, why don't I try? What the fuck, bitch? Yo! Just stop. Eun-young. You've done a good job. You've been transferred as of today. Team 1. Raise your hands. Yes, sir. Team 1. Watch the point number 5. Watch the back area. - Team 3. - Sir! I'll do it. I'll do it. Team 3 and team 4. Watch the front entrance. Team 2. Watch the street in front. This dog is a killer dog. We must catch it. Be careful with guns. What are we doing here? Just sitting around for a dog. What if Eun-young's wrong? It says a wolf can smell very far. For several dozen kilometers. Then we should've hung food. This is Unit 38. Target found! Location. East corner! This is unit 27. Confirm. Unit 38. Checking! In pursuit! It's running! It's fast! Calling unit 38. Confirm location. Unit 27. East corner by the river. To the suspect's house! Target found! Target confirmed! 11 o'clock! One! What? Who fired? Who's that? Isn't that Eun-young? Sang-gill What the fuck? - Unit 38. Confirm location! - Target is running! Sang-gill What are you doing? You insane? What's with you? What the hell are you doing? Eun-young Cha. Talk if you can hear me. Are you insane? What are you doing? Confirm location. Over! Sang-gil. Where are you? Sang-gil. Are you on the radio? Sir, I'm changing the channel. You have him? Where's Jil-poong? It's running along the road. I'll pursuit him. OK. Don't get too close. Yes, sir. Sang-gill Fuck! They changed the channel. Are we really chasing this dog? Sir! After this curve, we will enter the highway. You sure it's going the right way? There's nothing there. It's strange he's not getting off the road. I don't think he's simply running away. I'll keep following. Shit! Sang-gil's fucking gone crazy. What did she fucking do? I'm not really sure about this. How is Jil-poong? He's still moving at a steady speed. Keep your distance. Give me a sign if he takes off. I'll shoot it. Shit. Where did they go? They couldn't have gone far. Search all highways outskirt of An-san. Are you sure about this? Where is he going? Maybe he's lost. Let's stop chasing. And catch the dog. Let me go a little further. What if he gets away? Sir! It turned into a side road. I'll keep going. Careful! Don't forget the tranquilizer gun! The road is blocked! Eu n-you ng! Don't go further! It's dangerous by yourself! Eun-young! Turn back! If you slow down it might attack you. I said get back here! Don't you hear me? Come back! I'm still going! It's hard to talk on the radio. Stop going. It's too dangerous. Eun-young Cha! Where 're you? If you hear me, answer. Don't go in any further! If you slow down, it might attack you! Do you copy? Do not go in any further! Detective Cha! Answer me! Are you OK? Detective Cha! You OK? Talk to me. Where are you? Talk to me! Are you hurt? Answer me! I see a building. Jil-poong went inside. I'm heading over there. Hurry and come. I'll be right there. Don't move. Jil-poong is a killer dog. Don't go by yourself! What is it? What happened? Seung-man might have been mistaken. I saw something over there. Is it that dog? How did it find me? It's just a wild animal. The dog couldn't have followed us here. I saw it with my own eyes. Go out there with guns! Seung-man went out to check. Please wait. Our chairman is the founder of Myung-in Welfare Foundation. Detectives. I apologize for this. I should've kept my eyes on it. I feel somehow responsible. I'll gladly pay for my sins. That's Big Uncle. If you're so worried, let's you get to the docks. The boat is almost here. Bring these. Hurry. Make sure to pack everything. Stop! Police! Keep your hands up and back off! I'm arresting you for being an accessory to murders of Kang and Oh. Keep your hands up! Back off assholes! Gun! Shoot her! Where'd you come from? Bitch! Fucking bitch! Who are you? You're a cop? How did you find us? We're gonna be late. We'll take care of her. You go first. She might have company. Clean up quick. Yes, sir. Eu n-you I19! I'll kill you! Eu n-you ng! Follow him! Stop right there! Jil-poong! No! Back off! Back away, Jil-poong! Shoot it! Back off! Back off! Back off! Jil-poong... Back off! Jil-poong... Jil-poong... Daddy. What should we name him? To run like the wind. How about Jil-poong? Your name IS Jr!-poong. OK? Jil-poong! Jil-poong! Here they come! Any comment, please! Oh videotaped it when he was working for me. Then he got desperate and bit the hand that feeds. So I paid off Bae. And you killed Bae after he finished the job. How did you know Kang was after you? How can I not? All my lackeys were getting killed by a dog. Then I remembered Jin-joo. She talked proudly of her dad, a police dog trainer. Thank you so much for saving my life. I missed. Congratulations. Congratulations. You got your wish. Whatever. I'm going to the countryside. I'll come by on the weekends to see you guys. Captain Jo. Don't go overboard over there. It's not going overboard. It's called being spontaneous. Let's play a game of Go next time. Sure. Where's Jung-ah going? I found a nursing home near my house. She's staying there for now. That's good. Isn't it boring working in patrol again? It sure is. Can I get a transfer to your team? Even if you did, we can't work together. Captains don't have partners. That's why I asked. When Jung-ah gets better, I'll visit. Alrighty. See you. Lay off the motorcycle a bit. Yes sir. I think about Jil-poong's eyes. I will never forget. The night I ran with a urolf.
