You crazy fool! Causing trouble everywhere! Sorry! He's crazy! Dumb and deaf! Can't take my eyes off you for a minute! Lord, our apologies if we've offended you! If you're his grandpa, you should teach him properly! Don't let him come out and make trouble Yes! Go home, rascal! The "Eight legged unicorn"! That old man has disappeared! He can't get away! You're so impulsive! Fortunately, I came in the nick of time! If you don't change, you'll never be able to succeed! I'm useless! I'm no good! Isn't it a bit late to realize it now? You're lucky that you're only slightly injured! Lucky? Fortunately, you didn't show the techniques of our clan He doesn't know your real identity! That's why he wounded you only slightly! Otherwise, we'll both be dead I think you know the techniques of our clan well enough! I want to teach you another technique! It will give you a 50-50 chance against Yen! Only 50-50? How much did you think you had? It also depends on how determined you are But this technique is suited to you This technique is based on one's emotions Joy, sadness, melancholy, happiness! Play on the opponent's emotions and affect his judgment! This may be the technique to beat Yen! I'm going to teach you a new technique! It's derived from the "Wire" technique! The basis is to use your brains together with your strength Thereby exerting your power to the fullest And play on your opponent's basic emotions! "Joy" to subtly evade! "Anger" to attack as a wild horse! "Melancholy"- to adhere to the end! Happiness - to tease! Master Master Master "Eight legged unicorn"! I want to see how many legs you really have! Stop! How can three of you bully an old man? Kid, aren't you a mute? Only the other day! Normally, I speak better than you! Brother! I can handle him all by myself!

Even with weapons, you can't do it Let me see if you're still vicious! You're better! I can do it Go to hell! Get that! You stupid fellow! Don't come over! Watch that old fellow! Don't come over! Otherwise, I'll kill him Lung! Don't worry about me! Hand that to me! Kill him if you wish! Might as well let him die a martyr! It's better that staying alive as a cripple! Go ahead and kill him! Master, don't worry! I'll take care of you! Just how much is your life worth? We... You're all useless! Can't do anything right! Old man... Stop your pretense! Who exactly are you? The person to avenge the death of Chen Peng-fei! What's your connection to the eight-legged unicorn? Damn! I want to exterminate you once and for all! Not that easy! I want to skin you alive! Get up! I think you've had it! You're out of breath! Steady now! Right! Steady and take control! I must get my second wind... Second wind... Still laughing? You're crying! You can't lean on me for life!
