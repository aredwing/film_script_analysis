But Phoenix was different. : How was it different? - It was only the beginning. Come on! - What the fuck is going on, Mitch?! - Jesus Christ, we gotta go! We gotta go! - Glenn, come on! Over here! - Keep going! Go! Go! Go! Come on! - Come on, Jake! Come on, Jake! - Aargh...! - Come on! - What the fuck is going...? My God... - Sorry, if I had known I would've waited. - Alright, well... - We got plenty of time. - You know, we'll go down, we can get to the other side, it'll be perfect. Come on, come on, come on. Pick it up, Jesus Christ. Ryan! Let's go! Come on! - You comin'? - Cue to John Williams. - Wow! - Right?! - Wow! - You know how we're going down, right, Jake? - Put Ryan on Jake's back, push Jake down the side. - You've done this before, right? Just sliding? - ...ride you like an alpaca, man! I'm serious, you could do it. You go first. Come on, go first, you can. - Wait! Camera! Camera, camera, camera, camera! : Four Phoenix area residents are missing tonight after a local camping trip in the Estrella Mountains. - Despite the efforts of the Arizona County Rescue and the AHP, officials continue to scour the area by ground and in the air, but have found no sign of the missing hikers. The men were all experienced riders, and were in good health. - Susan Lauder hasn't heard from her son Glenn since Thursday morning around 11 a.m. - March 14th, 1997, authorities recover an abandoned ATV belonging to 28-year-old Glenn Lauder. His food and water supplies are found less than 50 feet away, but Glenn is nowhere in the area. - ...that provided the first real clues as to what may have happened to the four missing riders on March 14th. - The individual committing these abductions was extremely methodical. The location of the disappearance has led us to believe this was the work of a lone perpetrator, operating in a specific part of the desert. - New evidence has come to light linking the unexplained disappearance of four missing Arizona hikers. - Sheriff's Officials arrest Walton S. Gayson, a retired Veteran and religious fanatic, with a long history of confrontations with police. - The Phoenix District Attorney's Office says Gayson was involved in a fourth aggravated assault, where he attacked a Maricopa County Sheriff's station. - Chilling testimony from Walton S. Gayson, now the prime suspect in what investigators believe may be a four-person homicide. Gayson, seen... : During interrogation, Gayson confesses he witnessed the men's abduction, but insisted the men were taken by non-terrestrial beings. : But before Gayson can stand trial, Gayson is taken into Federal custody, and all information in the case is confiscated. - Investigators from the FBI will be reviewing the evidence and will be making a statement in the coming weeks. Thank you. - Gayson absolutely committed these murders, there's no question in my mind. It's like we were being sabotaged by our own country. - You think this was a conspiracy? - Absolutely. Something happened out there in the desert. - What do you think happened? - We got too close to something much bigger; the military didn't want us to know. - You're aware that, by giving this interview, they could come after you and your family? - Yeah, I know, I know. - Okay, you ready to do this? - Yeah, let's go. - In 1997, you took part in one of the largest military cover-ups in United States history. - That's correct. - And this involved a direct engagement with extra-terrestrial craft. - That's correct. - But the official defense department reports have never been disclosed. - Congress doesn't even know that this happened. - This began March 13th, 1997, during the single most controversial UFO sighting in North America known as the "Phoenix Lights". - Hey Sue! Take a look at this! - The Phoenix Lights. Tonight, lights in the sky. - Phoenix, Arizona residents are talking about one of the nation's largest UFO sightings. - There was a case... oh... a couple of years ago in Arizona, of some lights that were seen over Arizona. Um, and that has never been fully explained. - Like a fleet of planes or helicopters flying in formation. - The first reports of the strange flying object came in about 8:20 p.m. from a former police officer in Paulden, Arizona. - ...hundreds of eye witnesses reported sightings-- : They've been here before. Belgium, Osaka, Roswell: those were recon missions. But Phoenix was different. - How was it different? - This was the first time we knew what they were capable of. The first time we'd been provoked into an attack, or maybe the first time they were. - And as a result of this operation, four civilian men became collateral damage. - Yeah... I don't think a night's gone by in seventeen years that I haven't thought about what happened to those boys that night. - Get down! - Alright, so here's what I got. See here, I had to cannibalize a bunch of other cameras. They are wrecked, unfortunately, but, uh... Yeah, that's right! Hands free baby! And, why hands free, you ask? Lemme show you, with this... Keeyah! Alright?! You can do cool shit like this... Pow! Captain Fuckin' Magic, right? - Uh, Glenn had mounted this camera to the front of his bike and actually one to his helmet, too; the best we could do at the time, you know. But, like, he recorded everything, he managed to get every stunt way before Go Pros or, you know, any of the shit we have now. Glenn was, um, never scared of shit. He was just fearless. Oh ho-ho. - And you do realize how ridiculous you look in all this, right? - You look ridic... Fuck you! - He saved up his own money to buy his cameras. He filmed stunts, tricks, anything you could film. He was pointing that thing at something. Fuck yeah! Whoo! - When they disappeared it was... it was like life just stopped. They were so fun and... and full of life. - You find me attractive! - I think, that's my foot. And then they were just gone. Oh, you son of a bitch. Hey... you son of a bitch! So you are the best alarm clock of all. I know. Alright, let's do this! It's D-Day, motherfuckers! Shut up! Shut up. - Hey, are you sure you got enough food for this weekend? - Yeah, I got... I got everything we need. - I don't wanna eat bologna and beer every day. - No, I know. I know. It'll be fine, don't worry about it. - Where are we even fuckin' going? - Look, here, we can just... We're right here... - Why do we even have to go that far? Why can't we just, like, hit a bar, or a... - I'm not taking you to... to 'Nam or anything... - I just don't wanna get bit by a fuckin' rattlesnake. - Look, I'm doing this as much for you as I am for him, come on. Fuck! Yeah, I hear you! God dang. Hey, hey, hey! - What's up, man?! - Ready? Whattup?! - Look at Jacob, looking good, buddy. Where's Ryan? What? He's still asleep. Sh-shh! Whoo! Give me some! Give me some! Get the fuck outta here! - Yeah, I know. No, I fucked it up on that last jump, it's not gonna zoom anymore. - Oh, shit. - It'll be fine, though, I just can't zoom. - It'll be great! - "Bitches!" Aw, man, if we don't get out of here this day it's 'cause of YOU, you... What's the problem? - The zipper's stuck. - No, it's not. Hold on. - Leather. - Smells like victory. - Leather! So good. So good. - Out, out, out! - Out, out, out! One! Two! Three! - After you. - Oh, thank you, love. - I mean, for years, they told us it was over. You know, they couldn't explain the reports, the bone fragments, the lack of evidence. How good do I look? Huh? - No one would help us. I mean, if... if our boys are dead, where are the bodies? You guys look great. - But no parent should have to outlive their kid. We just wanna know what happened to our boys. - What? - By coming forward with this information now you risk exposing a military operation that led to the disappearance of these four men. How did you become involved with this event? - In 1997, I was stationed at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, Arizona as part of a special operations aerial unit. - And the weeks leading up to the incident, had you experienced any warning signs about an impending attack? - There were reports of livestock mutilations, things of that nature on our side of the spectrum. We had experienced, uh... atmospheric anomalies about 50 clicks west of the range. - That's in an area where the four men were abducted? - That's right. - But there was no other indication of an attack or an invasion? - No. No, not at that time. - And leading up to the incident, were you or your superiors aware of the four civilian men prior to that night? - No, we were not. - Walton Gayson? - No. - Were you aware that the men had been recording themselves? Did you... did you know that the footage existed? - Not at that time, I have subsequently become aware of that. I thought you had to piss?! - Dude. - Can I get space? Dude! - All right, fine! Is this what you want? This is what I want. - It's gonna take me a minute, hold on, with you watchin'. - Are you pee shy? Don't move. I'm gonna try to get it between your legs. - Nobody look, I get really embarrassed. - Oh my God, what are you doing? Holy shit. Did that freak you out at all? Is that gay? Is this intimidating anybody? Is that a squirt bottle? Got it on my shorts. - That's what happens when you pee into the wind. - Off a tire, into the wind. - My father would be so proud. God. - At that time Hale-Bopp was making its approach to the North-West. 0430 Nor Comm El Paso reported a... a triangular shape that was trailing behind the comet's tail. - Did you know what the object was? - They referred to it as a Chevron, but no, nobody knew what the hell it was. At 0700 there was traffic about a separation. The object had been following the comet until 1.32 aeronautical units, at which time it began a break-off and a rapid descent into our atmosphere. - And was there any indication where it was heading? - Yeah, somewhere over Arizona. - Yeah, this is how it begins! - We're gonna have to stop for gas first. - Sup, buddy? - Whoa! Hello-o. - We should take those, yeah? - Yeah, I know, right? Hey, here, take it, take it, take it. I gotta show ya something. I've been practicing. - Come on, man, I thought you were ready to go! Here, ready? You son of a bitch! - That's just like the best thing I have ever seen. - No, it's not! - Mitch was a good kid. He didn't deserve any of this. - Well, the family took the disappearance really hard. Especially since Mitch's brother Mark, he, uh, died in a helicopter crash in '92, two years after the Gulf War. - You know, I think that's why Mitch and Glenn had that... I, I think, you know, growing up around military, they, they were like family, you know, they uh... they were close, they were really tight knit, and... and once Mark passed on, definitely more so, I think, like, Glenn became like a brother to Mitch. - You could model... - Don't "big brother" him right now. - Just be nice, you just gotta be nice. - Look, I'm being nice, I'm telling him that he's brilliant. So, why aren't you painting? You never paint. - I do paint. - Dude, how come you don't make music. If you're a... if you're all a musician... - Ooh, I like it! That's a... that's a very good idea! - This is not about me, this is about him. - "Why don't you make music?" - You know why he doesn't have to make music? Because he dresses like he makes music, and that's the important part. - You know what that the difference is, is I'm gonna be a librarian who paints. You're gonna fuckin' go to L.A. and you're gonna... you know, we're gonna listen to you on the radio. - Damn straight. - You know, you're my best friend, but you need to get the fuck away from me and get the hell out of here... You know... - You said I was your best friend. - Only on Sunday nights. - You two belong. - I'm gonna go smoke pot. - Run, keep running, all the way to the coast. - If you don't, if you don't come back, we know you've gone to Los Angeles to be a rock 'n' roll star. - Dude... - Turn the fuckin' camera off. - You just fuckin' ran outta there? - Turn the fucking camera off, please. - ...fuckin' problem, man. Fuck that guy, dude... I love him, I know... - Ryan, he's doing it because he loves you... - No, he's not. The only reason why he... - No, we all do, 'cause we want you... because we know you're fuckin' good. - I get it. But I don't need to hear it from fucking Jake who can't get over his wife, who won't take his fuckin' wedding ring off, that I need to change my life and do something with him. Why doesn't he get off his ass and do anything? - That's his problem. - It's his problem, but I don't need to be... I know what I'm doing with my life and at least... out of the four of us, I've got... I've got a plan to do something, I'm not just sitting on my ass and, and... I don't know, dude. You can't just... I'm willing to do it. I'll pack everything that I have in the back of my car and fucking drive, and I'll get there. And I'll pump gas, I'll paint houses, I don't give a shit what I have to do. Well, just... Maybe there's a side of me that doesn't wanna leave, I mean... I don't know, I mean, - I'm... certainly not one to talk... - Yeah, I know, I know, we're good. - You don't believe Gayson acted alone? - When you're doing a criminal investigation, you look at every possibility, and then you consider the impossible. The impossible was that four healthy, young men could have been overpowered, abducted, and murdered by a single individual. - We have a very limited time that we get to talk to each other, so, uh, I would kind of like to get to some questions that I have, I've been wanting to ask you for quite a while. So, if you don't mind, are you ready to, uh... ready to begin? - You don't want to shake hands first? - I don't think we're allowed to actually touch each other, Mr. Gayson, but I appreciate the offer. - Courtesy. - But why did your department release Gayson after the incident? - We're following protocol. We investigate the case. We investigate the leads. We hit a dead end. - Yeah, but you had a suspect in custody. - We had a suspect who said that he witnessed the men in the area, but there wasn't enough evidence to hold him. - So you're saying your department released the last person to see the men alive? - No one took him seriously. He was a bit of a, a bit of a... a bit unstable. - When history paints a picture of me, it will say I was the monster that took them. I wasn't the real monster. - I didn't fuckin' feel it at first. Because of the shock, yeah. And then I look down, and the branch is literally sticking through my thigh. - You always laugh when you get hurt. Show and tell! Whoa. - Hey, do you have your Frankenstein, helmet rig thing? - Oh! Yeah! Get it out the bag in the back. Record button's on the side, just mash it and it starts recording. - He'll be the first man on earth to film his own death. Well done. - Pretty cool little thing. - Alright, check it out. Yeah, yeah, you like that? Yep. - Hey, guys! Something's going on over there. - What, what's up? - Check it out. What's going on? - What is it? What's up? - I don't know. - What the fuck? - By 0900 multiple atmospheric distortions began appearing across the state. - In the same position as the previous sightings. - That's right. Uh, the Nevada border, Paulden, and Flagstaff. - Those were the same warning indicators that happened in Russia and Syria. - We had two birds in the air, but there were no other confirmed contacts except for the formation. - Oh, shit... - What is that? It's not normal. - What the fuck!? - Goddamn it! - Get out and check it, Jake. - What did you hit? Did you hit something?! - I didn't do anything! Goddamn it! - Would you come look at this? - I'm on it. - Did you ever put oil in this? - Fuck you. - How far is it to your folks' place, maybe we can walk? - No, no. It's at least 15 miles or more. I don't even know where we are out here. - I don't think AAA's gonna come out this far. - Well, I don't think anybody's coming out this far, that's the whole point. - I'm sorry, guys, this is my fault. - No. Don't worry about it. Look, we'll try and find a phone, see if anybody's there we can call for help, yeah? - I'll stay here and see if I can at least get it runnin' or something. I'll get it patched up, if I can, and you can meet us back here, alright? - Jake, you're... yeah? - Yeah, we're good. - Dude, she's a big girl, she'll be fine. - Well, I don't like it. - Whoo! Yeah! - ...but Ryan got there like, his nut sweat stain was like a third of the size of yours, which makes no sense at all. - It was cold! - Do you remember that? He was like, "No! My nuts are starting to get sweaty, that's why. They just look smaller!" - Shut up. - Screamin', "I was in the pool! I was in the pool!" - Were the four men aware of the impending operation? Do you think they had any idea of what was about to happen? - Now y-y-you-you've asked me some form of that question two or three times now, and I've already given you the answer: they didn't know, we didn't know. That's it, that's not gonna change. Tire... I'm tired. - Okay... - Hey, don't touch the fence, I think it's electric. - You think? You think this thing's on? - I don't know, man. I hope it's not on, I just picture a fat serial killer on the other end, just staring at us. Shut up, dude. Shut up. - So, what was the official cause of death? - They said that Ryan had been attacked by some kind of an animal. The coroner said that they thought they found what were his remains. : Police say the remains of the four men have yet to be identified, however officials are classifying this as an animal attack, believing the men may have become victims of a bear... :...the March 14th, 1997 attacks, where 4 hikers disappeared in the Estrella Sierra... - Following the coroner's announcement, the County Attorney's office has suspended further investigation into the men's disappearance. - How many bodies did you recover? - There were no bodies. No tissue residue. Not even DNA could be recovered from the site. - So, in your opinion, could this have been a bear? - No. Absolutely not. - Everyone knew Gayson would never testify. So, the medical examiner was instructed to classify the event as a 'bear attack'. Families never had any resolution to what happened to their kids. : Despite public criticism of the Medical Examiner's announcement, the County Attorney's office has suspended further investigation into the men's disappearance. - Givin' up over here, or what? - I guarantee you he has never put oil in this car. He can barely wipe his own ass, how could he make it in L.A.? - What's with you guys, you used to be best friends? - I'll take that, I've had enough of this. I'll see if there's anything else... - I'm gonna go try to find some help with that road. - Are you sure? - Yeah, it's not that far. - Alright. - I'll be back. - Be careful, alright? - I will. - I don't want Mitch putting me in the ground. Great... f... - By 1100 hours, NORCOM had lost visual with the object. Within 30 minutes we had lost two KH-12 satellites over the Southwestern atmosphere. - They were entering our atmosphere? - There were conflicting reports, the... It was a fuckin' mess, nobody knew what they were lookin' for or where the hell to look. Well, Glenn, congratulations 'cause we are pretty fucked out here. Uh, Ryan's car's out of commission, so, we're stuck, and... There isn't shit for miles. And judging by the look of that shack you guys just headed off for, I'm gonna guess you're about to be chopped up into uh... hamburger meat, so, let me just go on the record and say 'I told you so'. You know, this whole trip, just... great fuckin' idea. - You need to leave! You need to leave, now! - Were you with the men the night they disappeared? - I warned them... ...but they came back. You need to leave! You need to get out! Fuck! - Authorities claim you were responsible for the disappearance of those men, but you've never spoken about any military operation that night. Get away from my car! : If you say so. - Why not come forward? Expose the truth? - I have made peace with my Lord, and He shall grant me forgiveness. I can't say the same for you. Whoa! Jesus! - Open the fuckin' door! - Take it easy! Take it easy! - Where is he? Where did he go?! There was this fucking guy right here! - What the fuck are you doing? - There was some fucking psychopath banging on the fucking car! - Hey! Relax! Ryan! I... - I think I just peed a little... - I didn't see anybody, did you? - What happened? - Why don't you just own up to the fact that you were beatin' off in there. - Look, can we get back on the ATVs? - I'm sorry I disturbed you, all right? - I mean, if we can expose a conspiracy, then none of this has to happen again. - It is happening... - I think people believe what they want to believe. But in my heart, I know Gayson killed those men. - They come. They take. They feed. They have no pity, no remorse. Their vision is pure. - See ya later. - We're good! - I'll pick you up later tonight! - Go! Come on, douchebag! Let's go! - Go on! I'm gonna catch up! - Those boys found something out there, something no one was supposed to see. The police, they just didn't wanna say what. - What do you think they found? - The truth. - And then you received a call to stop the investigation? - Can you shut that off? Our department... was told to back down by the Air Force investigative commission. - We have recovered circumstantial evidence of a possible connection to an incident in Arizona... - We received a call. They told us to suspend all search and rescue operations in the Estrella region, so that's what we did. - So you were told, essentially, to back off? - Yes. - Well, would you say that that was unusual for the military to intervene in a missing persons investigation? - Yeah. I'd say that's very unusual. - I was told. "Don't ask any more questions", and that's kind of where it ended. - This was not about a bear, or even about investigating Gayson. - You believe they were covering something up? - It was a distraction, to keep people from knowing the truth. - Look, no one talks about what happened that night. - At this point you were at DEFCON 2? - At 1730, the 104th reported multiple bogies descending into Nevada airspace. I got that one on video. - When they made an abrupt turn at the south... ...law enforcement, civilians had already seen it. There was no way to isolate or contain it. We couldn't respond in time. - Major sighting, here! - Well, our newsroom has been flooded with calls tonight... :...from all across the state of mysterious flying objects in the sky... :...in what many are already calling the largest UFO sighting in North America. - There were so many phone calls coming in from the city and the county, and people were concerned that this object could have been a threat. It passed over our airport, it passed over the towers, the buildings, and nobody was doing anything about it. - I don't care what nobody's talking about, man. Those were aliens and shit, like E.T., but aliens, man! - After hundreds of panicked 911 calls and reports to local authorities, airport officials were prompted to temporarily suspend flights, as the strange lights crossed over Sky Harbor air space. Air traffic controllers had been notified by Luke Air Force Base authorities, and numerous reports from nearby residents confirmed the base had scrambled F-16s shortly after the sightings. - We were tracking 'em for about 90 minutes coming in from Nevada. As soon as they entered our air space, we scrambled two '15's, but... the 104th was already engaged over that area. - Engaged? - Yeah, they had encountered them over the Barry Goldwater Range and evaded them into the south until we could intercept. That's when operation Snowbird went into effect. - Don't worry, baby, I'll snuggle up to you tonight, keep you warm. Come on, give me a kiss. - Quit jerking off with your toys. Geek! - What the fuck? I mean, look at 'em. They're all fucking aligned. - What are you guys lookin' at? - You're fuckin' retarded, you know that, right? - Look, look, look, look, look they're comin' this way. - Hmm? - Jesus. That... That's a UFO. It is not a UF... those are flares, dude! Come on! - Flares? From what? - Shh-shh-shh-shh... Listen. Huh, you hear 'em? You hear the A-10's? - Yeah, yeah, you can hear 'em. - That's what they're from, you dunce. Hmm? - What are they doing out here? - Must be part of that operation we saw this morning. - They've been doing maneuvers over the desert all day. - Oh, dude! Check it, check it, look, look, look! You see 'em? The two A-10's? - Oh, shit. That's not it, man. - Those are '15's! Oh, shit, those are '15's! Look how fuckin' fast they're going! Whoohoohoo! Oh, my God! - Why are they dropping flares, were they chasing something? - Maybe it's an exercise or a... training something. - What? At nine o'clock at night? - Yeah, I haven't seen '15's do maneuvers over a city in, what, like forever? - Yeah, but why here? Why aren't they down by the base? - I don't know! You know what this means, right? We're fuckin' going up there! - No! - We are goin' up there! Come on, man, let's go! Let's go! We are doin' this, baby! - Absolutely not. - What?! Come on...! - We don't know what that is, we don't even know where the hell we are right now. We should just stay here or go home. Melissa's fucking waiting on us anyway! - No, please don't bring Melissa into this, no... - Whatever shit is going on there, we do not need to be fucking with it. - You kidding me? You want to go home, Jake? Would you quit hiding from stuff? Please stop being such a fucking pussy, it breaks my heart! - I'm not being a fucking pussy, I don't think we should be fucking around out here, okay? I just have a bad feeling about this. I think we should go home now. - It's just some planes! - Yeah, and in two minutes, they're gonna be gone! - You're telling me that those are flares dropped from fighter jets, and you want to go closer? What if it's the fucking Russians, or something! - It's not the Russians! What are you talkin' about?! - Look! I swear I will get you the best blow job ever, just please come with me, alright? We'll go up there, we'll come back down, it'll take 10 minutes. You are going, yes? - Fuckin' a, man-- - Yes! He's going! He's going! And you're going too, baby! Let's do it! This is gonna be fucking great! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! - Jesus... - Lt. Col. James Edwards, now the Assistant Director of Operations for the 176th Operations Group in Maryland, says his squadron of A-10 Warthogs was on a training exercise over the Barry Goldwater Range. - So you're saying the lights that people witnessed were flares? - Most likely they were our LUU-2 illumination parachute flares. - Is that unusual, to drop flares over a populated area? - We were miles from any civilian areas. It was standard procedure to drop unused ordinance after a run. - I still don't know what it was. As a pilot and a former Air Force officer, uh... I can definitively say that this craft did not resemble any manmade object that I'd ever seen. And it was certainly not "high altitude flares", as put out by the, uh... the Air Force at Luke Air Force base, because I've never seen flares fly in formation. - There were about five or six craft, uh... We were tracking their progress for about ten more minutes... And when they passed over the city, they broke south for Tucson. - What changed? - Well, after what happened in, uh... Belgium and Osaka, we... we sure as hell weren't gonna take any chances. - What kind of chances? - Fuckin' move, let's go! - Mitch, Mitch. Hold up, man. - Move it, let's go! - Are you serious? See that shit?! - Let's just turn around. ...freakin' me out. - ...seen anything like this? I mean, what the fuck is going on? - What's that one behind that one over there? - I don't know, it's not a '15. - Yeah, no fucking a right, it's moving too fast. - They're dumping more flares. Ugh, let's get the fuck out of here. - Two of our F-15's approached them from the North. One of our birds attempted to make contact with the lead craft, and the other objects instantly egressed from the AO. - Flares... - Okay. - ...multiple bogies closing in on your position. - Check your nine o'clock... - We had an E-3 in the air covering with FLIR. We could see them on visual, but they were completely invisible to radar. - I was passed some information that said this was operation Snowbird. The information this man gave me was codenames and Snowbird was diversion. - Can you tell us specifically what operation Snowbird is? - In the event of a mass sighting or an engagement over a civilian populated area, operation Snowbird would deploy deterrent measures or diversionary tactics to draw eyes away from the combat zone. - A distraction operation? - Yeah. - So when the public saw the lights over the city they weren't seeing the actual craft? - No. No, they were seeing our flares. - Is it unusual to drop flares over a populated area? - Well, I've already stated that we-- - Eh! Look, as Lieutenant Colonel Jones stated in his report, the events of March 13 were a documented training exercise with the 104th fighter squadron. - Is it unusual that A-10's from another base would violate your air space without first contacting your flight controller? - Lt. Col. Jones and his men were well within their area of operation. - And, does this include operation Snowbird, as a diversion exercise over the Estrella Mountains? - Alright, we're going to end this interview now. - I didn't expect those questions. - At, uh, 2200 hours... they cleared the E. Mountain line, and that lead craft, uh... changed trajectory, and engaged our fighters head on. - So, what was going through your mind? - I had never seen anything move so fast in my life. Okay, stay on top of them... - Everyone defending! ...missile launched! - Warning. Warning. Warning. Warning. - I don't think so, I mean they're not supposed to be able to move like that. - Whoa! Look, look, look, look, look! - Oh shit! - Oh, fuck, what the hell was that?! - Jesus Christ! - What was that?! - Oh, my God, man, that's a pilot... - But why did we shoot it down? - Come on, we gotta go. - What're you doing?! - That's enough, listen, dude... Mitch, get... - Everybody on, everybody on! Come on, man! - Goddamn it! - Where the fuck is it?! - I think they went this way, somewhere over here, come on! - They're looking in the wrong place! - Come on! - Do you see it?! - It's on the mountain there! - Right over there! Look! - Mitch... - Wait, hang on, get down, get down. We need to turn around, right fuckin' now. - Hang on a second. - No, why...? - It's a fucking pilot, we can't leave him. - Listen to him, man, he's right. You've had your fun, let's get the fuck out of here. - If that's one of ours, I'm not gonna leave him here! - "One of ours"? What are you talking about, dude? If that's one of ours, military, someone's coming after him. - There's nobody else here! It's our chance to save him. Will you just fucking come with me for one second?! - We don't know what the hell that is! - We're just gonna see if he's okay! If he's fine, we'll go back down, we'll get some help, alright? It'll be fine! - If who's fine?! - The fucking pilot, man! God, he needs us! - Listen to me. Nobody needs us, and this is not the time for you to play hero. - What're you worried about? - What am I worried about?! About him going up there, getting us all fucking killed, we shouldn't be here in the first fucking place. Listen, Mark is not up there, okay? - What the fuck did you say to me?! Fuck you, dude! - I'm trying to save his fucking life! - You wanna be a fucking baby, fine! I'm going after him! - You've lost your fuckin' mind! Go! - You sack of shit! Fuck you, Ryan! - Fuck... - If he dies, it's on you! - We gotta go, we got-- - Get the fuck off me! - Let's go! - This is bullshit! Let him go! - Would you leave up there, alone? Come on! - This doesn't make any sense. - Come on, man... - Mitch! Mitch! - Ryan, man! Ryan! Shit! - They were scared. We... uh.... We're talking about best trained pilots in the world, best equipment in the world, it doesn't matter. We were not prepared for anything like this, nobody is. - Can we fucking go now? - Come on, Jake, a little further, buddy. - Come on! - You see this? - Hey, you good? - Yeah. - Mitch-- - Shh! Shut the fuck...! Dude, come on! - That's gotta be one of our jets, man. Did you guys see an ejection or anything? - No! - No, nothing. Can we go now? - Would you shut the fuck up, come on! I gotta go up. - Mitch, no. No, no, no, dude! - Mitch! - Fuck. Then stay here! - That is far enough! - Mitch! What the fuck is that?! - There was no heat signature. Our E-3 controllers were unable to find the crash site for 28 minutes. By the time we did find their location, it was too late. Oh, my God! - Go! Go! Go! Go to the bikes! Come on, come on! - Shit! Shit! Shit! Mitch! - Come on. If they knew they were trapped, wouldn't they have done something about it? I mean, this is the U.S. military for Christ's sake, they can do anything they want. - Come on, Jake! - Glenn! - Mitch! Ryan! - Jake! Jake! Jake! - Jake! - Oh, my God, dude... His leg is fucked, man! Shit! - Take it easy. Jake, listen to me, buddy. You're gonna be alright, okay? You're gonna be okay. - Oh, God, Jesus. - I don't know, alright. I don't know. - Let's just get him back on one of the bikes. - Don't think that's a good idea! Nooo! - Okay... - What about those things? I don't know! - Fuck! - Come on, Jake, we gotta go, buddy! This way! Come on, man! - Come on, Jake. Come on, buddy. - Guys, this way! Jesus! - I can't see 'em! - What the fuck is going on, Mitch?! - Move! Come on, man! We gotta go faster! Come on! Come on! This is the way, guys! Come on, follow me! Hey, guys! Over here! Down here! Down here, come on! Come on, let's go. Oh... : What are we even doing? - Shh-shh-shh-shh! Okay, alright, hold up. Let's stay here for second. : We never should have fuckin' come here. - I know, I'm sorry, buddy. - We'll never get out of here! - Listen, man. Just hang in there, alright? We're gonna get through this. I'm sorry, buddy. We gotta keep moving, though, okay? Can you walk? - I don't know, man, I don't know. - Jesus. Uh... Alright, listen... It's either stay, alright? And wait for the sun. Or we try for it. It's up to you. Shit... - What're we doing here, Mitch? - Just... let me think for a second. - I think they gave up. We can make a run for it! - Shhh, did you see how many there were?! - Are you fucking crazy? They are fucking hunting us! : Okay, we've got four civilians heading in 0230. Multiple contacts North of their position. - Stop! Stop! - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay! Jesus Christ! - We gotta go! Come on! Come on! - What the fuck are those things? - Glenn, come on! - Over here! Over here! - Come on! - What's that light coming from? - I don't know, maybe it's a house. We gotta go! Go, go, go! - Come on, Jake! - Come on, Jake. - Shit! It's the same house from this morning. It's the same fuckin' house from this morning, man! - I know it is! What else are we going to do?! This way, come on! - Argh! Come on, come on! You got him? - Tracking civilians at 0647. - I wish I could share the pain I live with everyday. The shame I feel when I look at myself in the mirror. I've prayed. Oh, God, I've prayed. I'm not ready for the Kingdom of Heaven. There's only one savior waiting for me. Hey! Hey! Guys, over here! Come on. - Mitch, they're close! Come on! - Come on, hurry up! - Ah, Jesus, come on! - They're coming! - Come on, open the gates! Open the gates! - Open the fucking gates! They're right behind us! - I don't wanna die out here. It's open! It's open! Go! Go! - Get inside! Get inside! - Help me bar the fuckin' door! - Ooh, Mitch! Mitch! Mitch! - Yeah-yeah! I'm coming! Put this... put this over here! - See how fast they were moving? - Oh, my God, guys. We have got to get Jake to a hospital! - Call my dad, he'll... he'll know who to call, he's... Can't find a phone! Where's the fucking phone! Shit! Mitch! - We can't stay here. We gotta find some help. - Well, listen, whatever took that thing down, if it's military, someone's gonna come looking for it, right? Right?! - Wanna stay here and wait for them to get here? - I mean, what are we going to do about Jake? - I don't know, maybe... we'll just leave him here. - What?! What the fuck are you talking about?! We can't just leave him here! - I am not staying in here with those things coming in to tear us apart! You understand me? - Oh, shit! - Fuck! Who the fuck is that?! - Who the fuck is this guy? - Shit... - Man, I know we're trespassing here, but we got these things out there chasing us. - Listen, man. We have to find a phone. - Our friend is hurt real bad. Please help him. Please. Please! - Hey, look, I think there's some kind of misunderstanding. If you could just let us wait here for a while, we'll stay here until somebody can come and help us. Hey... - What the fuck, man?! - What the fuck did you just do? Dude, how could you open those gates! - You son of a bitch! - Oh, my God, dude! Mitch, Mitch! Mitch! - Come on, we gotta move. Come on, let's move! We can't stay here! - Come on, come on, Jake! - Okay. Okay, okay! Okay, okay. - Guys. There's a lot of blood, man, we gotta stop this bleeding. - Goddamn it! What the fuck?! Okay, check the beds. There's gotta be something in here. - Oh, shit! - Yeah. - I got two! I got two! - That'll work. Yeah. - At least it's something. - It's better than something. Here, catch. Hanging in there, Jakey? - Mitch... Mitch, I'm sorry for what I said about Mark, man. I didn't mean it, okay? - Yeah, I know, man. - And... I'm sorry about Melissa. I'm sorry I porked your mom. ...but I kinda wish it was the Russians. - Easy, man. Just take it easy, okay? It's gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. - Jake! - Oh, my God! Jake! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Jake! - Oh, my God! - Then why did the men return to the house? - Geographically, it was the only place within miles of them. It was the only safe port in the storm. - And other than those men, the public had no idea what was happening. - They were the only ones up there and we couldn't risk anyone compromising the operation. - You got it? You got it, man? - Yes. Yes, I fucking got it! - Come on! We got to get 'em. - No, dude, you have no idea how many of those things are out there! - But I pushed him here-- Turn the fuckin' light off! Shh-shh! - It's in the house! - Shut up! Shh! Shh-shh! Shh-shh! Shh! Shh-shh! Shh! Turn the power back on! I don't. - Jesus! - Motherfucker! What are those things?! What'd they do to Jacob?! Tell me! What do they want?! - Oh, shit. - What the fuck? - Once we were able to mark their position, our SAR teams were still about 15 minutes out. You could see the men were getting ripped apart and... and we had no choice, we had to do it, we had to attack. - Oh, oh, God, they're shelling us, man! - Who?! - The military! - Jake's still out there! - They're bombing 'em! - Shut up. Shut up! If you don't fucking help me, I will end you! Where's more ammo?! - Watch him. - No! Mitch! No! Mitch, come back, man! - Mitch, wait! - Hey... There's a light up there! - Oh, shit! - Find something. Go through this! - He's got cameras everywhere. He's been watching us the whole fucking time! Shit... - There's gotta be something we can use! - Mitch! - Yeah. Keep it. - Okay. Shit. They lead us here. He's helping them! - Guys!? - That's Jake. Oh, shit! - Hey, hey! - Mitch. Mitch! - Ryan! Ryan. This is you. You got my back, I'm going after Jake. Alright, let's go. Come here. Come on! Let's move! - Mitch, wait! Mitch?! Ryan?! Glenn! - Let him go! No, n-no, man, please? Please?! No-I, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - You okay? Alright, come on, get up. Get up. Come on. Come on, Ryan, let's go! Let's roll. Glenn, let's go! - Where the fuck did he go?! Come on, let's go! Over here! Glenn, come on, let's go! - We gotta go! - I'm going to go out the front and get Jake. You two go out the back, get to the ATV's, I will meet you there. Okay? Now, come here, come here. Listen. I can do this, alright? I got it. I'm way faster without you two bitches, anyway. Alright? First one there, get to the ATV, fuckin' haul ass and get some help. Okay? - Okay, okay. - We can do this. Let's go. - Alright. - Mitch! :...local hostiles converging on the target. - We could see 'em on scope. There was nothing else we could do for 'em. That was the worst thing I've ever seen. :...clear to engage the target. - Roger that. - One friendly down, confirm, we have one friendly down. - Okay. - Continue engaging. - Ryan?! Come on! Let's go, come on! No... It's in the house! It's in the fuckin' house! Ryan! - Go! Go! Glenn! Run! Go! Don't fucking stop! Oh! Let's go! Go! - Come on! Come on! - Come on! Come on! - They found us! : We got two civilian friendlies exiting the structure. - Yeah. - Roger that, we got them. Hold that position! - Hey! - Hey! Down here! : Back and left. Back and left. Alright, hold. Get that ladder down to them. - We got 298-9 about 30 seconds on scene. - Down here. - Come on! We're getting outta here, Glenn! - We're down here! - Hey! - Oh, shit! - Ryan? Ryan? What're you doing? - Run. Run! Ryan! No! No! - About two weeks after the, uh... incident, a captain from Davis-Monthan made overtures toward the press, apparently he was going to bring this story to their attention. About 72 hours later they found he and his A-10 aircraft crashed into the side of a Colorado mountainside. Pentagon said it was, uh... equipment malfunction and gross pilot error. Nobody came forward after that. - Do you believe the men were taken by aliens? - I'm not telling you what I think. I'm telling you what I know. - He was 28 when they disappeared. Glenn would've been 43 years old next month. - And the official medical examiner report still lists the incident as an animal attack? - That monster took my son. He knew what he did, and they're just as guilty as he is for not telling us. - And then it was over. They just closed the case. It was like no one would help us, or even acknowledge they existed. - Their case was never brought to my attention, and when I asked about the incident I was told "no more questions". - But now I'll ask Officer Stein and his colleagues to escort the accused into the room so that we may all look upon the guilty party. - But the bottom line is, they lied to us. They're trying to hide the facts that fit their version of what happened. - Look, our goals are the same as the families': to find answers. Now, as a parent, I sympathize with them, but in this case there's simply not enough evidence that this was anything but an animal attack or some kids who got caught up in a cult. - The amateur photographer was camping in the Estrella mountain range, south of the I-10 highway. Along with him, Mitch Adams... - Anyone with information about their possible whereabouts is encouraged to contact the Arizona Missing Database or call 1-866-2Find-Them, and remember, the call is anonymous. - It is 8:16, the night of March 13th, 1997, and suddenly, over the skies of Paulden, Arizona, what is described as a giant, brightly lit boomerang, soars through the air slowly and silently. Just 16 minutes later that same UFO is spotted by thousands of people over the Phoenix area. People report seeing it, pilots report seeing it in the air, yet military radar screens pick up nothing. - If those boys are dead, where the fuck are their bodies? Where the fuck... are their bodies?! Okay. Hello. My name is Walt Gayson. And my joyous day has finally come. My brothers and sisters have all risen above this world and left their vehicles behind. But today it's my turn to follow the Chosen Ones to the Kingdom of Heaven. It is time.
