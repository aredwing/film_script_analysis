You may tell your people... ...we fight because they have invaded our country. They want to govern us, tell us what to do. We want to govern ourselves. We want Syria for ourselves. We fight to throw out our enemies. To recapture our freedom. And we will win... ...because God and justice are on our side. France is not in Syria as an enemy. We come because of a mandate granted to us by the League of Nations... ...which Emir Hassan and his followers refuse to recognise. We are here because it's our duty. We intend to fulfil that duty. With divine guidance, victory will be ours. He says the curfew spoils his business. lf he waits for the sun to come up, his fish will stink. Tell him his fish stink already. l've tried appealing to reason. l've offered concessions. l've posted proclamations. Now l am forced to resort to more drastic measures. l have here a list of prominent Druze sympathisers. l want them taken into custody immediately. Today at noon, six of them will be lined up against a wall in the square... ...where our men were murdered. The remaining will be forced to witness their execution. -Do l make myself clear? -Yes, sir. l want one last proclamation posted. From today on... ...for every Frenchman murdered, we will execute five Syrian hostages. There's a language they should understand. That's the fourth patrol they've shot up in 10 days. My orders are to stop Arab resistance in this area. That's exactly what l intend to do. Thank you, gentlemen. Feroud. Yes, sir. Why don't you say it! Go ahead and say it! This hostage business makes you want to vomit. On the contrary, l think it's an excellent idea, as far as it goes. But why shoot only five hostages? Why not 10? Or even 20 for every soldier killed? ln no time, you'll have the population of Damascus... ...against the walls, and you've ended all resistance. My soldiers didn't survive Verdun to have their throats cut in this hole. Sit down. Do you think l like to slaughter civilians? The Syrians will think so. They don't think. They're guerrillas, bandits. They consider themselves patriots. We French came along with a mandate-- They don't like it, and they don't trust us! l know all that! l know how to make them happy, too. Pack up my army and march out. lf l may say so, there is another way. You could send me to see Emir Hassan. You never let go of an idea, do you? lt still isn't too late to arrange a truce. You'd only get your throat cut. You know what a butcher he is. l wonder what they'll call you after you execute those hostages. Never mind what they'll call me. l'm only concerned with doing my duty. What about the men who are supplying them guns and ammunition? -You should have had some results by now. -l think l have a lead. But one or two leads. lt's like trying to stop up the holes in a sieve. You want them to call me softheaded. Sentimental. You have to be realistic. There's more than one way of being realistic, sir. -Robbinet! -Yes, sir. Countermand my order to shoot hostages. Arrest them, hold them for 48 hours and then release them. Yes, sir. Satisfied, Louie? Perhaps you're right. Perhaps sending someone to see the Emir is the best way. That pleases you, doesn't it? lt's worth a try. But l'm not sending you. You're too valuable a man. Send someone else in your place. Lt. Collet. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. No smoking. Look how everybody's worried. Why worry? He asked us to come, we came. lf he wants to do business, we do business. lf he doesn't want to do business, we don't do business. Right? Not right. Wrong. What do we have to sell? Food. Since when does the Chief of lntelligence buy food for the Army? Don't make me nervous. As you were. Good morning, Colonel. Beautiful morning, Colonel. There's very little more l can tell you. This is where you'll meet the contact. He'll take you to insurgent headquarters. And as far as l know, he's reliable. But don't trust him. Don't trust anybody. Watch yourself. Yes, sir. Give him this message from me. lt will introduce you. You're aware of how much depends on you? Yes, sir. You'll have to change into civilian clothes. Carry some sort of small arms. They'll probably take it away from you. This is entirely voluntary, you understand? lt isn't an order. There's a good chance of your getting killed. l understand, Colonel. All right. Good luck, Collet. Thank you, Colonel. You see, you asked us to come and we came. Just like you asked. l'm informed that all you gentlemen hold considerable quantities of food. -Not very much. -You want to buy? We want to sell. l'm further informed that contrary to regulations... ...you take advantage of the food shortage, to sell at outrageous prices. No. Where did you get such an idea? -This isn't what l dictated. -l'm sorry, Colonel. The Army will not tolerate profiteering in any form. -Why should you? -Of course not, Colonel. lt's dishonest. Now, l have invited you here in order to make a suggestion. lt'll save you a lot of trouble if you sell all your supplies to the quartermaster. Of course, gladly. But the price. We want to be fair. -Give them the new official price list. -Yes, sir. Wheat, 60 piastres, rice, 90 piastres. You call this fair? Under the circumstances, l consider it generous. Looks all right to me, Colonel. l'll send in whatever l've got. Just a minute. Your name, please? Smith. Harry Smith, sir. You're very cooperative, Mr. Smith. l believe in being cooperative, Colonel. May l leave now? You may leave. He was at liberty to refuse my offer. ln which case, l would have been forced to confiscate his goods. l hope you'll be as wise. Good day. -These are outrageous prices. -That's all. Good day! Yes, sir. Coming. What have we got on Mr. Smith? Mr. Smith? l have him right here, sir. Harry Smith. Born Henry McReady. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Newspaper reporter on various newspapers all over the country... ...Philadelphia, Boston, New York. Volunteered American Expeditionary Forces. Wounded, decorated. On leave in Paris. Went AWOL. He's been getting into trouble ever since. Bookmaking, women. Shall l read it all? He'd been operating a gambling house in Damascus. We closed him when we moved in. He's quite a boy. Yes, sir. Nasir is here. He brings someone. Mr. Harry. l bring a friend, a man who's in trouble. He needs your help. The French came to take him hostage. By the grace of God, he got away. He's got wives, children. Doesn't know which way to turn. He needs your help, to escape from the city with his family. He's willing to pay. Tell him it'll cost him 1,000. He begs you, out of the kindness of your heart. Get rid of him. l thought he would be worth bothering, Mr. Harry. -What is it? -lt's a French gun! What do you care whose gun it is, so long as it isn't aimed at you? Wait a minute. Your curfew pass. Here you are, Doc. Go ahead. Good evening, Mr. Harry. -'Evening, Arthur. How's business? -Fine. Anything interesting tonight? -There's a beautiful little mouse. -Yeah, where? There. l think she's new here. l never saw her before. That's big city stuff. Constantinople or Cairo. You like? Nice. Who is she? l don't know. l want to buy these. How much? You want to buy? One more. What are you going to do with those, Mr. Harry? Teach you how to play them, maybe. You going to teach the Colonel how to play, too? Thank you, chri. Flowers. Two, please. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. How's business tonight, General? They're having fun in there eating shashlik and drinking arak. Lights! Turn on the lights! Leave me alone! Andr! There's people hurt in here. Get MPs and first-aid immediately. Very well, sir. -Are you all right, dear? -Leave me alone. Get away from me. No! Sit down, dear. l'll see if l can get you a doctor. l'm all right. You and your cruddy Syrian patriots. They were after Col. Feroud. They almost got me. You eat with the French, you get what the French get. Here. Thank you. Hurry. Sir, we need you outside immediately. This is terrible. Are you all right, gentlemen? Don't worry about us, worry about them. Anies, candle. Let's get some more light over there. Here, drink this. -Where do you think you're going? -l want to get out. And get shot at? Here. l'm cold. The doctors will be here right away. They got the man that did it. Don't release anyone until they finish questioning him. -No one in or out. -Yes, sir. This man, he helped me. Thank you. Curfew pass. All right. Look at me. Just look at me. How awful! What a terrible thing. Look, my stockings! You can always get new clothes. How? ln this awful place you can't get anything! lt isn't as bad as all that. How can you say that, after what happened tonight? We might have been killed. Yes, you're right. l might have been killed. l'm lucky to be alive. How foolish l am to worry about clothes. That woman, how she screamed. l thought she would never stop. lt's good to be alive. lt's late. Why don't you go home? Please lock the door when you leave. Good night. l shouldn't have taken you there. lt wasn't safe. After this we won't go out anymore. That's a brilliant idea. We'll be together. That's all that matters. Cooped up in this little apartment? l don't seem to know how to please you anymore. l'm not difficult to please. lt's very easy to please me. l wonder where it is. What are you looking for? l thought it was in here. l remember. l was afraid l'd lost it. Beautiful. l got it at the Folies Bergres, in Cairo. Wasn't that before l knew you? Maj. Leon sends his apologies, sir. Thank you. l must leave. Here you are again, Mr. Smith. Yep, here l am again. Pay me off and l'll be on my way. You're late. l amused myself thinking perhaps you would not come. Give my regards to Emir Hassan. Ask him to tip me off the next time his boys toss a grenade at my elbow. -l'll give him your message. -Thanks. What an oddity you are, Mr. Smith. An American in Damascus. No morals. No political convictions. l've had them. l find that difficult to believe. l had a bellyful of them. l left them in the States with my first wife. lsn't there anything you believe in? You mean right now? Sure. l believe in this. And it's 2,000 short! One load of ammunition was not delivered. l sweat blood getting through the toughest blockade ever put on a city... ...and you hold out because l'm late with one small load. We haven't any money to waste. You'll get the rest of yours the moment the cart arrives. This is the kind of luck we needed. He claims he didn't know the guns were under the sacks. He was told to drive to a street called Straight... ...and wait for another driver. -He has a sick wife and 4 hungry children. -Three wives and 11 children. What about the other driver? He didn't show up. We're guarding the whole area. What did you find on him? Not a thing. He could be telling the truth. People in this job are too clever to take him into their confidence. They have a chain of drivers that don't know anything. l'm sorry, l thought this was the break we were looking for. lt could be... ...if we could find a man who still has some dried apricots. Good night, Major. You wish to buy some jewels? -Have you got some good ones? -Beautiful jewels. Fit for a dream of a girl, one who is different. They're all the same. Each new girl is different. With each new love, a mist comes before the eyes. The pleasure you will have before the mist rises... ...and you find out that she's like all the others. What kind of gift would you like to buy for her? Rings? No. Necklace? Pearls? You've got to do better than that. Bracelets? Haven't you got something a little more.... This girl. She is different. l know of a bracelet made with moon gold, encrusted with diamonds. Can you get it for me? lt's so beautiful. She would love it. But it belongs to another. Would it be difficult to steal? lmpossible! She's an old woman. The bracelet is all that remains of her youth. She sleeps with it next to her cheek. Then why tell me about it? l know a lad whose step is as light as a moonbeam. He will drift into her room, take it from her, and drift out. -She will hardly dream. -How soon can you have it for me? Two hours. Wait a minute. How much is this going to set me back? l will let you steal it from me. -Yes? -Miss Violette? Yes. -You were at the Moulin Rouge last night? -Yes. There was a disturbance. And after the disturbance, you lost something? No. You're sure you did not lose a bracelet? -You woke me up. Why don't you go? -Please, just a moment. l was told this belonged to you. Yes, l didn't even know l'd lost it. lt must have slipped off my arm in the excitement. Thank you. Thank you. l wish there was something l could do. No, thanks. Happy to oblige. Goodbye. l am Balukjian. The Colonel has sent for me. -Go right in. He's waiting for you. -Thank you. Come in. Col. Feroud! My friend! When l got the message from you, l was happy to come. So happy! Mr. Balukjian, sit down. Do you know what office this is? But of course. lt's your office. And do you know who l am? Col. Feroud. Everybody knows that! l'm also head of military intelligence. Did you know that, too? Yes. You must know it's part of my duty to protect the Army from spies, traitors... ...and saboteurs. To arrest and eliminate them. To eliminate them permanently! Why do you talk like this? To me? You or one of your friends are selling guns and ammunition to the insurgents. Guns? Ammunition? Look at me! l'm an honest businessman. -Does he convince you? -No. Doesn't convince me, either. Colonel, why do you talk like this to me? Someone's running ammunition. How do l know it isn't you? Of course it's not me. How could it be me when it's not? What can l say to you? What is he writing? He's taking everything down. lf someone is running guns, you must find the dog! Don't give up until you find him. Maybe l can help you. l know them all, like the insides of my own pockets. They're all my friends. How can l convince you? -Tell him how he can convince us. -Anything, my friend, anything. Yes. Who is it? lt's me. Remember me? Should l? Last night, the Moulin Rouge. Boom! -lt was you who helped me. -lt was. -What do you want? -Dropped by to see how you were. l'm fine, thank you. l'm sorry, l can't ask you in. That's all right. l don't mind. Nice place you have here. Are you happy? Why? You got your bracelet back. How did you know? My man brought it to you. And what did you say your name was? Smith. Harry Smith. l was glad to get it back. Yes, he told me. Where did you find it? Somewhere on the floor. How did you know it was mine? lt was easy. lt looks like you. How did it look like me? lt would take a long time to tell you. Go ahead, tell me. You know.... Yes, l know. How much did it cost you? -May l? -Please. lt was pretty expensive. You must be a very rich man. l do all right. l run a sort of import-export business, l guess you'd call it. Anything people can't get, l can. Liquor, good food, stockings. Any luxury item. Can you get the latest Paris perfumes? You name it, l've got it. Last week, when l was in Cairo-- -You were in Cairo! -Yes. l get around a lot. l'm sorry you're leaving so soon, Mr. Smith. -Am l? -Yes, you are. You can't blame a guy for trying, can you? -l don't blame you at all. -You've got to admit it was a good idea. -lt was a wonderful idea. -l can't understand why it didn't work. l can explain it to you. You try too hard. You push too hard. Yes, l guess you're right. That's always been one of my great faults. You have so much to learn. You can't teach an old horse new tricks. Or is it dog? -Do you mind if l finish my drink? -Please, go ahead. -Shall l pour you one? -No. You're so impudent. As l said, you can't blame a guy for trying, can you? Sure you won't join me? Not now. Nasir, my little lamb, my sweet friend. We smelled you coming. He said you smell like a goat. Always you joke with me. l'm getting used to your little jokes. -Why are you so tired? -l came running. -What, my little toothpick? -What's the matter with you? Me? Nothing is the matter. Why? You look sick. Doesn't he look sick? -Yeah. -l'm never sick. That's what my poor father said just before he died! Nasir. My little shrimp. You are trying to worry me. lt's the way you laugh. Nasir, would a sick man give a party? l came here to invite you. l want you to dance for me. He wants me to dance for him. We're like brothers. We're like the fingers of the same hand. What will we celebrate about? The day of my birth, what else? How we will fill our bellies. How we will eat. And such food! -Except for one or two things. -Tell me. Maybe l can help. lt is nothing, really. This morning Anoosh said to me.... You remember Anoosh, my wife? How she can cook! This morning Anoosh said to me, ''So you have pilaf for the party, all right. ''So you have pahklava, all right. So you have a whole lamb... ''...hidden in the cellar, fine! But how can a party be without sweets? ''Get me some dried fruit,'' she said. ''Figs,'' she said, ''peaches.'' But l said, ''Who has figs, peaches, and dried fruit in these days?'' -So we have no sweets. -We have dried apricots. You have dried apricots. Yes, we have plenty. Nasir! My sweet little moustache! My heart is no longer sick. l will send a man to pick up the apricots. ls it all right? The chef was a little worried he left it on the grill too long. -Tell him not to worry. -Thank you. -We'll have the hors d'oeuvres. -Yes, Colonel. -And the soup. -And then the soup. How is the Tournedos la Orsini? l'm sorry, Colonel. The Tournedos la Orsini is not available. Then we'll have the Chicken Richelieu. Forgive me. lt's not available either, sir. Would you mind telling me what is available? Tonight, sir, we have the lamb la mode. -What's that? -Lamb stew, sir. ls that what Mr. Smith is having, Arthur? No, Miss, Mr. Smith is having a steak. Filet mignon. -That's what l'd like, chri. -lt's not available either. -lf he can have it, why can't l? -Mr. Smith brings in his own food, miss. How clever of him. Clever people always get what they want. Why don't we bring our own food, chri? There must be places where you can buy. -l don't patronize places like that. -Why not? -We'll have the lamb stew. -Yes, sir. Would you like to dance? Yes, l'd love to. Very much. Excuse me for one second. -Good evening, Mr. Smith. -Good evening. l forgot to thank you for last night. lt was very gracious of you. -You are very welcome. -l hope l see you again, soon. l hope you do, too. Colonel. -Why do you persist in embarrassing me? -Did l embarrass you? -You know you did. -l'm sorry. Thank you for a charming evening, darling. l'm glad you enjoyed it. l think l'd like some coffee. Would you like some coffee? Yes, l would. You didn't have a good time tonight, did you, darling? Every time l looked at you, there you sat with your long face. lt almost spoiled the whole evening. l was feeling in such a good mood. -You don't seem to understand, do you? -No, it seems l don't. May l explain it to you? Please do. l like it when you go out of your way... ...to explain things to me. Everything becomes so clear. l'm an officer in the French Army. Everything an officer does is held under a glass... ...magnified out of all proportion, criticised. l have to be careful to behave in a responsible way. And you share that responsibility with me. l have to represent the French Army! Really. When you're with me, you have to be more respectable. This Harry Smith.... Your talking to him reflects on me. l find him interesting. He's attractive. l like to talk to him. l'm sorry, but l'll have to forbid you. lt's for your own good. l'm thinking of you. You know, darling, l wonder if we've made a mistake, you and l. Everything l say, everything l do seems to make you unhappy. l'm upset, l'm not unhappy. Of course you are unhappy. Look at you. You don't even know how unhappy you are. lt's my fault. l shouldn't have come to Damascus. lt isn't as serious as all that. l'm really thinking of you. l wouldn't blame you if you were angry with me, wanted to get rid of me. Why don't you let me go back to Cairo? l don't want you in Cairo. l want you here, with me. But l don't want to be here, with you. l want to leave you, darling, l really do. You're upset. l've talked too much. l'm not upset. My mind's made up. l want to leave you. The city's under martial law. All travel is restricted to military personnel. A man of your importance, you can arrange it. l won't. You mean you'd make me stay here against my will? lf necessary. You know by now how l feel about you. And knowing this, you still want me? Yes. What kind of a man are you? l can't do my work. l don't know what's happening to me. You've got me to the point where l'm not myself anymore. l think of you all the time. lf you won't arrange it, l'll have to find another way. Mr. Smith was here this afternoon. He's such a clever man. Forgive me, Violette. l don't know what l'm doing. lf you leave me, l'll kill you. l'll kill you if you try to leave. Get your big stomach out of my way. My poor stomach. lt's so sensitive. Every little thing upsets it. Do you have any soda? What's the matter with your stomach? lt talks to me. Like my conscience. What does it say? lt says, ''Levon, my own lamb. Why do you stay in this terrible town? ''Why don't you go away? Far away?'' Why do you talk to him like that? Yes. Why should l go away? Here in Damascus is opportunity. Here l make money. Here l live. ''Don't ask,'' my stomach says. ''Just go. ''Go. Before they put the screws on you, before they torture you.'' The things people do to people. What people? People. We are such animals. My stomach is right. Why do we stay here? We must leave. Such things can happen. Do you know what he's talking about? He doesn't know, himself. Harry. Have you been to church lately? You should go. We should all go. lt's good for our souls. l'll bet he's trying to make a touch. -You want to borrow some money? -Money! l got plenty. lf that was only it. Then what is it? How can l tell you? Tell him. Good night. l tried. Heaven knows l tried. You tried what? Shave me. Miss Violette. l'd hoped to see you again, but l didn't-- Could l talk to you, please? lt's a little late for that, isn't it? Can't we go inside? All right. Sit down. Make yourself at home. You were lucky to catch me in. l'm usually busy at this time of night. How come you're not busy, too? Now let's see what we have. Cognac, armaniac, calvados, kmmel, brandy. Chartreuse. For you, Chartreuse. l want to tell you why l came. Whatever it is, it'll look better through the bottom of this glass. l've broken with the Colonel. Scotch for me. Don't you want to know why? l know. He bores you. You're so sure of yourself. You know everything. What l don't know is why you came to me. Remember you said, ''lf there was anything a person wanted....''? Yes, l remember. -You said you often go to Cairo. -l do. Can l go to Cairo? Certainly. Easiest thing in the world. Will it be expensive? For you, very reasonable. Almost nothing. But l want to pay. You'll pay. What a man. You're so ugly. Yes, you are. How can a man so ugly be so handsome? What are you banging on the door for? Something awful has happened. Something awful. l was sleeping. lt came to me. lt woke me up all of a sudden. Balukjian. -You know Balukjian? -Yeah. What about him? l don't know. Maybe it's nothing. Today he came to the warehouse. He said he was giving a party. Wanted some sweets. Those things were under the apricots. He wanted to know if.... What did he want to know? lf l could give him some apricots. Did you? Yeah. You! You shot off your face, you told him. l'm dumber than you are. He was trying to tell me he'd fingered us. l should have known what he was hinting at. l've got to get out of here. All we've been through together... ...pals, like brothers. l make one mistake and look how he treats me. You're his friend when he needs you. When he don't.... Yours, too! l'm coming with you. l've got to move fast. l can't with you around my neck. lf l can't keep up with you, you can leave me. No, it won't work. But, Harry, what will l do? Now l'll never get away. Here. l'll send for you from Cairo. Thanks, Mr. Harry. Don't you understand? l'm in bad trouble. l don't care. l may not be able to get myself out. l'll take the chance. All right, l'll see what l can do. Wait here. Marhaba. Yes, Mr. Harry? Ask him what the chances are of getting out right away. He wants to know, one or two? Two. He says he will see, Mr. Harry. Well? l don't know yet. This place. Such a nightmare. Will we be here long? No longer than we have to. l must be crazy. Here l am in this filthy hole. You asked for it. You wanted to come along. Running away. Always the pattern of my life. There are times in everyone's life when they have to run away. l hope we make it this time. What will happen if they catch you? They'll shoot you, won't they? First they'll have to catch me. Here, you'd better wrap this around you... ...and try and get some rest. No telling how long we'll be. He says you will leave tonight, Mr. Harry. At 2:00. The price will be 200, for each. 200? What does he mean, 200? He says to tell you that you are expensive. The French are looking for you all over. All right, l'll pay. He says now, Mr. Harry. He says thank you, Mr. Harry. We get a bus in two hours. Looks like we're on our way. Do we have to wait here? -l'm afraid so. Cigarette? -No, thank you. l'll be glad to leave this town and everything in it. l want to forget l ever knew him. l want to be happy. Harry, let's have some fun in Cairo. We can try. Hurry. Get in, Mr. Harry. When do we start? Seems to be some trouble. Something with the motor. Quiet. French patrol. All right. Maybe l can help. -What's the matter? Why won't it start? -No spark. The wire's off the magneto. Okay. Let's go! Thank you. Get that man! Don't let anybody out! Come on, get in, get inside. Stand guard. He dropped this. Here, give it to me. Sergeant, you take the wheel. They wanted a ride? We'll give it to them. You have no appointment. -l'm in trouble. -Yes, l know. l need your help. l need money. l have to get away. l'm sorry, Mr. Smith. We cannot help you. What do you mean? l got you guns and ammunition. l helped you. Mr. Smith, you're a fugitive with a price on your head. You might have led them here. You must never come back. We have no further use for you. Next. Get her. Mademoiselle. -What are you going to do with me? -Get in. -You'll decide to forgive me, l suppose. -Take her home. Come in! l have news for you, Colonel. Lt. Collet has returned. Now l know where l stand. What did he say, sir? He didn't say anything. He couldn't. His throat was cut. He was found in an alley, collecting flies. l'm sorry. He was a good officer. He died for nothing. That's what happens when l listen to you. You can't talk to these people, Colonel. They're fanatics. They want war. l'm going to give them war. l've ordered two fresh combat divisions for this area. That may not be necessary, sir. We've stopped their main supply of ammunition. Yes, l know. l read your report. But in the last 12 hours there have been outbreaks all over the city. Patrols have been ambushed, our men have been murdered. l've made up my mind. You and your Emir Hassan. lt's time you stopped dreaming, Colonel. From now on, l'll have to make my own decisions. Now if you'll excuse me. Yes? Colonel, there's a man outside who says he knows where Harry Smith is. What? Send him in. Come in. Well? Where is he? He says he wants 150 before he'll tell where he is, sir. Tell him he's got exactly one minute to tell me where he is. He says he wants 100 to tell where he is. He's got 40 seconds. You look sick, Mr. Harry. You should rest. Could l get you some coffee, Mr. Harry? You will feel better. -Forget it. -lt will just take a moment, Mr. Harry. -l haven't time. -Almost ready. Just have to add the water. Mr. Harry, is this what you were looking for? Since when are you giving back money? What are you up to? Nothing, Mr. Harry. Come in, Smith. You wait. Come here. This belongs to you, l believe. You dropped it running away. Not quite as valuable as your neck? Having fun, Colonel? We suspected you for quite a while. The charge against you is running guns and ammunition. Have you anything to say? lf you can prove it, what can l say? Last night we arrested one Nasir Salim, a friend of yours. We have his full confession. The evidence against you is incontrovertible. Do you know the penalty? A slug in the head and a hole in the ground. l have here your dossier. lt contains the history of your life. You're a man entirely without moral scruples of any kind. You supply the Syrians with guns and ammunition. But l respect them. They fight for a cause. Your cause is only money. While Frenchmen and Syrians kill each other, you profit by it. According to military law, you have to be shot. The punishment seems hardly adequate. What have you got me up here for? To watch me sweat, to watch me crawl? l'll bet they didn't bring Nasir up here before they shot him. What a pity you could only die once. Sure, l know l'm going to be shot, but not for running guns. But because l'm something special. l made a monkey out of you. l'm the guy that ran off with your girl! Don't you realise if l wanted you shot you'd be in a ditch right now? Do you know Emir Hassan? Yes, l guess l know him. Can you get to see him or any members of his staff? Can you reach any of his people? l think l can. lf you can arrange a meeting for me with Emir Hassan... ...l'll get you a pass that'll get you out of the city. Mind if l smoke? Smoke. This was almost my last one, wasn't it? Can you arrange a meeting? l can try. l'm sure you'll try very hard. -What about my money? -Confiscated. l'm dead without it. Let's say you'll be alive in a new way. The last time l wore this suit, l was in Cairo. When do you want me to tell the old man? He'd try to stop me if he knew. Better give me an hour. John. l'd like to talk about a personal matter. There's a lady. l'm very fond of her. She wants to go to Cairo. l've decided to arrange it. -Don't you think you ought to wait? -No. l want everything settled before l return. All the documents are in that envelope. lf she needs any help, l'd appreciate it if you'd take care of it for me. l understand. -Goodbye, John. -Good night, Colonel. Good luck. l don't get it. Everybody's got something that makes them tick... ...but l can't make you out at all. Walking right into their hands. You're going to be one dead colonel. What time did they say their contact would be here? He'll be here. You must have an awful strong urge to commit suicide. l don't get it. l appreciate your trying to warn me, Smith. l didn't expect it from you. l'm a little surprised myself. Here he comes. Hand this to my sergeant, he'll give you the pass. lf you're not out of Damascus in 12 hours, you'll be shot. Good luck, Colonel. Good evening, Mr. Harry. Good evening, Arthur. What's the good word? You tell me. There isn't any. lt's a great life. You go around in a big circle and come right back to the beginning. Were you ever down to your last thin dime? Many times. He was right. When you're broke, you're alive in a new way. What do you mean? Forget it. l wish l could give you some money. But repairs, expenses.... Hello, Harry. l got here as fast as l could. lt's good to see someone you thought was dead. l'm glad you feel that way. While we're on the subject... ...l've got some news for you that'll make you feel even better. What is it? Your colonel, you'll never see him again. He's dead. What? But how? He deliberately walked into Syrian headquarters. You know what that means. He had some kind of a crazy idea he could arrange a truce. l'm sorry. l know l should have been nicer to him, but l couldn't. l tried, but l couldn't. What makes you think you had anything to do with it? He didn't blow his brains out because of you. You didn't even know the guy. He didn't know me either. He never knew how l felt... ...and how many times l wished something like this would happen to him. You're a sweet kid. You sent for me. ls this why you sent for me? No. l've got a pass. l'm going to Cairo. You still want to go along? l can't show you as good a time as l could before because l'm broke. The French took all my money. But don't worry. As long as it keeps getting dark l can always get some. You have no money? Harry Smith has no money? l'm glad. You never needed anybody. And now you need me. You need me. l have a pass, too, and money. Lots of money. Maybe l can show you a time. Would you like to go with me? We'll discuss later who's going with who. -What are we waiting for? -l'm ready. My bags are all packed. l got to get my pass. l'll pick you up at your apartment. We are going to have fun, aren't we, Harry? l don't know whether l'm too good for you or you're too good for me. l have Mr. Smith here. Yes, sir. The Colonel said all l had to do was show you that letter... -...and you'd give me my pass. -Come with me. Do you mind telling me where we're going, or is it a military secret? You'll see. Mr. Smith, sir. Come in, Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith, sir. l'm informed that you arranged a meeting between Col. Feroud and Emir Hassan. That's right. l suppose you knew that they wouldn't let him come back? -l tried to tell him. -Never mind what you tried to tell him. Where did they take him? Where is he now? l want every detail. He met the contact, they walked away. That's all l know. -You know more than that, Mr. Smith. -Col. Feroud is a very important officer. Gen. La Salle would do everything possible to save him. We want to know where their headquarters are. That wasn't the deal l made with Col. Feroud. Mr. Smith, l advise you to be cooperative. lf l don't play ball, l don't get my pass. ls that it? Sign this man's pass. lf Col. Feroud gave his word, we must keep it for him. Yes, sir. l had hopes this man would help us. He's as good as dead, and you know it. We have to try, we have to make some effort. They'll cut him into little pieces before you can get to him. Can l go now? You may go. Sorry l couldn't help you out. They always need money. You might offer them money. How much would you say? 10,000. They know he's head of lntelligence. -l think we can manage that. -Sir, it would be a job to contact them. The last time we tried, our man got his throat cut. lt's very easy to do when you deal with people like that. You managed to get Col. Feroud to them. Let's say l was lucky. Maybe you could get lucky again. Maybe you could get money to them if you really wanted to. Sorry, no dice. You definitely refuse to take one of our officers to them? l do. Why? Because l'd be risking my neck ever to show up at their headquarters again. They've already warned me, and believe me, they meant business. We'd protect you. When you get down there, nobody can protect you. Why should l take a chance like this? Because maybe you'd like to do something fine and unselfish for a change. Maybe you'd get a kick out of trying to save a wonderful man's life. And lose my own? lt's a real long shot, isn't it? But l've been playing them all my life. Okay. Let's try it. -What's the West Point of France? -St. Cyr Military Academy. -Did the Colonel go there? -Yes. You, too? Why? l was just wondering how you two happened. Usually all they teach you is how to tell somebody else to go out and die. Pour la patrie. You look like the kind of fella who might be married. Yes. Matter of fact, l just celebrated a wedding anniversary. Any kids? Just one. A boy. -Are you going to send him to St. Cyr? -Yes, if he wants to be a soldier. That's fine. He'll follow in your footsteps. That's great. lt's a great life. Nothing like handing it on to a bunch of kids. They'd break your neck if they knew what was coming. You're very bitter, Mr. Smith. How did you get that way? The facts of life. Some learn and some don't. What is this place? Where are we? The ancient Roman catacombs where they used to bury their dead. lt smells like it. You were told you were no longer welcome here. l'll be welcome this time. l've been authorised to negotiate the release of Col. Feroud. You are now representing the French, Mr. Smith? Yeah, l guess that's what you'd call it. l won't start with 5,000 and let you work me up to 8,000 or 9,000. l'll lay my cards on the table. 10,000. That's my offer for Col. Feroud. l see. And this, l presume, is a French officer? Maj. Leon, French lntelligence Service. You will wait here. You never know about these characters. You never know. Come. Your Excellency, l had to see you. You are seeing me. That's more than your other emissary did. Someone cut his throat before he got here. What do you want? l've come to make an appeal to reason. You expect me to be reasonable? How can l be reasonable with the French? lsn't it possible your hatred of the French blinds you? What are you trying to tell me? That we are defeated? We are lost? We do not fight to win. You will win. But it will be a victory you will regret. The world shall know you for the butchers you are. Those are the words of a fanatic. What did you expect? l'm not interested in what you have to say. But my soldiers haven't had much pleasure lately. l shall give you to them. You may talk to them. They will give you the attention you deserve. We have just had word from your general. He's worried about you. He wants to save your life. He offers 10,000. My soldiers will be disappointed, but l think l should sell you. With 10,000 l can kill a lot of Frenchmen. You will also kill a lot of Syrians. We will die gladly. Yes. l think l will sell you. 10,000. A good bargain. Why don't you do both? Take the money and kill me, too? You want to die? Why do you want to die? l only want to arrange a truce. Cease fire for 24 hours, so that Syrians and Frenchmen can sit together. And what shall we discuss, the terms of our surrender? We can try to settle our differences according to the dignity of man. There is dignity in men willing to give their lives for what they believe in? -Men needn't die to prove their dignity. -You're asking me to surrender! l'm asking you to consider your people. An effort must be made. We must make some effort. Otherwise, we're not civilised men. Perhaps we'll fail, and the war will go on, but at least we will have tried. That's all l want. Colonel, you are a fool. l come to talk of peace and understanding, and you call me a fool? Yes, Colonel. l respect you. But you are a dreamer and a fool. What am l doing down here anyway? l got my pass, l got a nice trip to Cairo. You, come with me. No, you, Mr. Smith. -Don't you think l'd better-- -No, it's okay. l can handle it. lt looks like we got away with it. There you are. 10,000, one colonel. That was the deal. Thank you, Mr. Smith. l sure thought you were a goner. Buying my freedom was your idea, l suppose? Yes, it was. Why did you do it? l should think you'd want to see me out of the way. l made a little money on the deal. -l see. -l saved your life and you seem to resent it. l do. Maybe you should have had me shot after all. l agree. May l leave now? Maj. Leon is waiting for you. Mr. Smith. We would like to have a word with you. What's on your mind? l thought you were told never to come here again. You needed money. l did you a favour. You showed Maj. Leon through the catacombs, the way to our headquarters. The French were a little reluctant to trust me alone with all this money. -What did you tell the French? -Nothing! What would l tell them? About the ammunition we bought from you. About our contacts. About the way we broke through their blockade. Come now, Mr. Smith. We know you're working for the French. They're your friends. -l'm strictly neutral. -ln times like this, how can you be neutral? You have to be on one side or the other. l'm a businessman. l do business with you. Why would l spoil it? To save your neck. The French usually shoot people like you. Why aren't you dead? l told you, l'm in this strictly for business. How many times do you want me to prove it? All right, l'll prove it again. l'm going to Cairo. l've got good connections in Cairo. This junk you've been fighting with. l can get you modern equipment. -Latest machine guns. -Can you get us grenades? -All you want. -Very interesting. Don't you think, Colonel, we ought to pay him a little in advance? Yes. Would 2,500 do? -l don't want anything now. -Help yourself. -No, thanks. -Then we'll pay you on delivery. As usual. As usual, gentlemen. We'll hear from you when you get to Cairo. You'll hear from me. Goodbye, Mr. Smith. Emir Hassan said l was a fool. He was right. -What is it? -That's odd. Listen! The shooting's stopped. l wonder. Did l persuade him to be a fool, too?
