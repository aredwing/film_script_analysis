Hey, got your costume picked out for tonight? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. I'm thinking of going as an, um, exhibitionist. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's scary. Hey, it's the only day of the year I can wear something slutty and get away with it. You know, I wish.. I wish I knew a poem or something right now. Something romantic and deep. Hmm. It's too bad you're flunking English. I am not. Sorry, sorry. Remind me why you skipped class yesterday again? I wasn't feeling well. Right. You threw up all over your paper-mache. I remember now. You are such a jerk. What time is it? Oh, shit. - Where you going? - Shit, shit, shit. I have to go to the clinic and I'm so late. They want me to pick up a prescription or something. It's just a follow-up. Hit me. Don't go. Hmm. Later, stud. Could, um, come by your place? I mean, if you want my mom to snip off your balls. Huh. That's what I thought. Catch you later. Hey. You boys know this is private property? Who's gonna clean that up? Dr. Henry? Your ass is grass and I'm the lawnmower. Now, get outta here! Take those eggs home to your mom. - Whatever. - See ya later. - Later, cop! - Howdy, Mike. Hello, princess. Guess you're not much of a Halloween guy, huh? No, I am not. One of these days I'm liable to shoot me one of those little brats. Aw, come on, if it wasn't for Halloween this town probably would just vanish right off the map. You got a point there. I'll see you later. Take care, kiddo. Wednesday at 3 o'clock. Thursday at 10:30 a.m. Alright. Well, just be sure to bring any information... Hey. I like your costume. I like yours, too. I'm not... I'm not wearing a costume. No, that should be fine. Bye-bye. Okay, Dora, he'll see you now. Happy Halloween. That can't be true. I'm afraid it is. Are you sure? Well, according to your HCG levels you're about four weeks in. No, I, look, I.. There has to be some sort of mistake. Hey, it just takes one time. So now we're gonna have to.. We're gonna have to figure out what to do next. I'm 17. Dora.. You're not the first person to have this happen to before they're ready. Well, what am I supposed to do? We can book a follow-up appointment. For next week. Okay? Review our options. We still have time. But whatever course we do take, um.. Well, we're obligated to notify a parent. No way. Dora.. I understand that you may be feeling a wide range of emotions right now. And that's very normal. You can take precautions but.. Nothing is ever 100%. So now we're gonna have to.. We're gonna have to figure out what to do next. I'm gonna assume you know who the father is. You sure you don't wanna... wanna talk.. Always taking Halloween nonsense too far. Dora, Dora, Dora, wait. This is not the time to isolate yourself, okay? People can be a lot more understanding than you think. And, uh.. You're smart enough to know that whatever you talk about with me is strictly confidential, so.. Call me. If you do wanna talk. Or I can refer you to a specialist. Thanks. Don't hesitate to call. I'll see you next week. Dr. Aaron, dial extension 200, please. Dr. Aaron, extension 200. Dr. Burr, 4-1-2-0. Dr. Burr, 4-1-2-0. Dora. Can you hear me? There we go. - Ew, slimy. - Nice try, mom.
