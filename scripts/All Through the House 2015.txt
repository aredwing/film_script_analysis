And you know I don't like to see him if he isn't happy. You know that. He'll get happy, just give him a second. Why don't you take him into the bedroom, go make him happy, then I'll join you in a minute. Okay. I'm ready when you are. I'm ready. Come on, I really need to get ready.

[police radio chatter] [Gasps] Yes, well, um... [Dog barking in distance] [Music playing] Glory to the newborn king peace on earth, and mercy mild god and sinners reconciled joyful all ye nations rise join the triumph... - what do you think you're doing? - Grandma. I thought that we both decided that you were gonna stop leaving presents for your mother. You know, when you were a little kid it was cute, but now, it's kind of creepy. I've missed you so much. I'm sorry I have to rush off. I'm Christmas shopping with Gia and Sarah tonight. Don't worry about me, honey. I've got a huge bridge tournament tonight, and I'm gonna kick some hairy ass. This is from Mrs. Garrett. There's actually a police officer outside her house right now. She wants to know if I will help decorate her home for Christmas. Who does shit like that? - She's offering to pay. - Fuck her. Watch the mouth. It's Christmas. And you don't even feel a little sorry for her? I mean, especially after what happened to her daughter? It's none of our effin' business. You're right. We are gonna have stress-free holiday. [Crickets chirping] [Woman straining] [Grunts] - Whoa, oh, oh, oh... - I got it. - Uh. Oh... - I got it. I thought Santa and me were goners for a second. Oh, here, let's just lay him down here. [Sighs] Rachel Kimmel. I am so glad you dropped by. I simply couldn't have decorated this house by myself. Oh, the letter. Um, actually, i... Do you remember Jaime when you were a little girl? I remember she couldn't come outside. I think she had some kind of skin disease. Bowen's disease. You know, my life was not the same when Jaime was taken from me. A pity. She could've been like you. I try not to let my mind wonder like that. You know, I didn't know your mother very well. But what I do remember, she was beautiful. You think I look like my mother? Would you like to come in and get something to drink? Um, I actually have to go shopping, but, uh, it should only take a couple of hours. Would you like me to come back? You'd really come back? Thank you. I'll see you later. [Dog barking in distance] [Woman] Sugarballs, Sugarballs, get back here. [Barking] [Growls] [Growling continues] - [Punching] - [Whimpering] Sugarballs. Sugarballs. Sugarballs. [Clanging] [Thud] [Man's voice] You're just a worthless little girl. Get over here! Hi. [Straining, struggling] - [Voice #1] I've got a present for you. - [Voice #2]It's playtime. [Woman's voice] Stop telling me what to do. I'm not some punching bag that you can take your aggression out on whenever you want. [Exhales] Men. You're all alike. And don't think I'd forgotten what you... [Voices whispering] What you did to me. I was just a child. And you... Passed me around to all those... [Voices whispering] Men. Like I wasn't even... Human. [Growling] Yahh! [Gasping] Don't you worry, darling. Oh! [Squealing] This boring town is awful without you. I can't believe I actually miss it. Well then, let's not waste any time. Oh, oh... Photo op! [Shoppers chattering] Hey. - Hi. - [Squeals] Muah. Muah. Have I got a surprise for you. You're scaring me. Come on, let's go. You'll love it. I promise you. Keep your eyes closed. Now open. Surprise. Don't blame Sarah, okay? I put her up to this because you wouldn't take my phone calls. What? Merry Christmas. [Footsteps approaching, screaming, giggling] [Laughing] Close your eyes and open your mouth. I got a big package ready for delivery. [Both laughing] Are you feeling adventurous? I thought having sex while your parents were gone was adventurous. [Bells jingling] What's that? Adventure. [Giggling] No. What are you doing? Oh, you aren't scared, are you? What if there's an emergency? Then we create a safe word. And then if things get too wild for you just say the safe word and I'll stop. All right, what about... - "Jingle balls"? - [Laughing] Uh. You are so helplessly cute. I'll be right back with a big surprise. [Kisses] Hurry up. Fucking bitch. Ah, fuck. What the fuck, man. [Gasps] [Music box playing] What the...? Why don't I wear the costume? You know, you're always on top, right? [Floorboard creaking] What's behind your back? Is it gonna make me scream? [Labored breathing] Jingle balls. Jingle balls! Jingle balls! Jingle balls! Jingle balls! Jingle balls! - [Snips] - [Screaming] [Screaming] [Hyperventilating] [Screaming] [Girls laughing] Yeah, check 'em out. [Laughs] What the hell happened? You just left me. Just stop blaming your mom for everything that's wrong in your life. I'm not gonna leave you like she did. I wish I wasn't so scared. [Mrs. Garrett] Come to the table, darling. Dinner is ready. You are such a lovely, lovely girl. And your mother loves you so very, very much. She loves you because you are perfect. Absolutely... Perfect. You really should eat, dear. [Gasps] [Sighs] What did you say to me? Just once I would like to have a nice dinner without you picking a fight with me. You always find some way to ruin my appetite. Maybe next time you can make the dinner and I'll berate your cooking skills. Would you like that? And you haven't even said anything about how I look tonight. Men. You're all alike. You are going to pay for that. I thought I was doing you a favor. Oh, you wanna do me a favor. [Laughs] Fine. I got a job for you tonight. A job? You mean like work? I don't work. [Both laughing] [Engine starts] [Knocking on door] Hi, Mrs. Garrett. Gia Wilson, and Sarah Hayes. I remember you both. Please. Wow. Are you going somewhere? Oh. You ran off so fast, I forgot to tell you. I have a date tonight. It's not a big deal. I should only be gone a couple hours. - [Laughs] -That's pretty fast for a woman who hasn't left a house in over 15 years. I didn't say it was a romantic date. [Laughs] Heavens, no. I gave up dating those monsters years ago. No, I am celibate and content on remaining so. [Laughs] [Nervous laughter] I mostly need some extra boxes brought down from the attic. And I have more lights I would like up outside, and I haven't done any decorating in the bathrooms. There's plenty of food in the fridge. And I would be insulted if you did not have a glass of my holiday eggnog before you left. No one makes it quite like me. Oh, and before I leave, I need to show you the door to the attic where I keep the extra decorations. Here are the stairs to the attic. Is that Jaime's room? May I? Didn't I give this to Jamie for Christmas one year? She loved this doll. Um, I always wanted to know why you never let Jaime play with us outside. She always looked so sad watching us from her window. Jaime was very fragile. [Mrs. Garrett] I just wanted to protect her. She needed protecting. They don't want to play with you, baby. They are selfish and spoiled rotten. They don't have a good mama like you. Now, come away from the window, baby. Stop torturing yourself. Those children, they won't understand you. They will make fun of you. They will laugh at you because you are different. Do you hear me? Did you hear me? What are you looking at? You see, baby? They don't want to play with you. They ain't nothin' but a bunch of naughty little children. I always tried to have a very positive attitude around Jaime. I believe positive reinforcement is very important for a child's mental health. Thank you for opening up to me about Jaime. It's nice to finally understand why you and Jaime were so isolated from everyone. I hope you don't mind my asking... But what happened to Jaime? There are so many awful rumors. How did she go missing? [Inhales deeply] That is a conversation for another day, sweetie. I don't think either of us needs to be dredging up our painful pasts. Now, don't you girls do anything too dangerous. Safety first. [Chuckles] I just can't believe this. I remember seeing the three of you playing in the street. And now look at you. Thank you for your help. What... come here. Come look at this. Why would she screw the windows shut? Well, I'm sure it's just for added security. I mean, she lives alone. That's debatable. I have to admit these mannequins are kinda creeping me out. I say we blow this joint. Oh, come on, I cannot bail on her now. It's not just the mannequins, they're strange, Rachel. Come here. I wanna show you something else. All of these presents are addressed to Jaime. Can you believe it? No one in their right mind would do something like this. I don't know. Maybe it makes her feel better. Or maybe she's just cuckoo for cocoa puffs. - [Laughing] -Is it wrong for her to hold onto the hope that Jaime might come back some day? Come back? I thought she was killed. Well, there have been all kinds of crazy rumors. Who knows what really happened. I know what happened. I was in kindergarten and Jonathan Curtis who used to live down this very street, said she was snatched right out of her bed in the middle of the night. And that's not all. He said he knows where she was taken. That she was taken by some hideously deformed creature named Krampus. What the hell is that? Don't listen to her. Krampus is just an urban legend. That's what you think. Krampus is basically like Santa Claus, but just the exact opposite. He kidnaps and tortures little children who misbehave during Christmas season. As if Santa wasn't creepy enough. Hey, I was only five fucking years old when he told me that story. He scared the shit out of me. I had nightmares for days ever since. Jonathan and Curtis destroyed my childhood. Strange how you lost your virginity to him in high school. I know, right? [Shower running] Honey? Thanks for leaving the window open, sweetie. It's not cold or anything. Babe. Are you gonna be feeling frisky when you get out? Because once I start reading... Fine by me. [Gasps] [Thumping] Ahh! Ugh! [Gasping] Oh, no, god! No, no! No! No, please! Ahh! [Music playing on radio] ... of the dear savior's birth... babe, you're totally missing out on this shower. It's really warm. And I'm really wet. ...he appeared and the soul felt its worth babe. Did you hear me? A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn... are you feeling frisky tonight, babe? Fall on your knees... jeez. Hello, babe. What the fuck? Mandy! [Screaming] [Whimpers, shouts] [Whimpers] [Gurgles] [Rachel] Haven't you ever had a strange collection before? Collections are just a waste of time and money. Only boring people who have nothing better to do - collect things. - Really? What about your collection of beanie babies and stds? [Laughs] If I'm gonna survive this night, I'm gonna need something better to sip on than old lady watered-down eggnog. You could run down to the shop 'n' stop. You have about ten minutes until 12 o'clock. Okay. I have to try this dress on. It's beautiful. I don't think that's a good idea. I think it's a great idea. This is going on Facebook. I thought you were in a hurry. It'll take one second, I swear. Make it fast. I'm gonna go get the other boxes from the attic. [Squeals] - Gia. - Ah! Look at this. So what? Mrs. Garrett was a nurse. Big deal. How do I look? Uh, could you forget that for one second? I'm serious. Look at it. Read the name of the person standing next to Mrs. Garrett. Laura Kimmel. My mother. Are you fucking with me? Mrs. Garrett lied to me. She told me that she hardly knew my mother. Why do you think she would say that? I don't know. What would she be hiding? [Cell phone ringing] - [Abby] Hello? - [Rachel] Grandma? I need to ask you something, and please be honest with me. Well, of course, honey. Did you know that my mother and Mrs. Garrett worked together? Were they friends? Why are you asking me that? Just tell me. Rachel, [Abby] Let's have this conversation later. Where are you? - Please... - [Phone beeps] [Music playing] - Rah! - Ah! Come here. Whoa. When you said Mrs. Garrett was lonely, you weren't kidding. Oh, what's her deal? Well, she's certainly not a people person. [Sighs] Maybe they make her feel safe. Is that her? Oh, god, it is. Cover him back up. This is getting more twisted by the second. I... Look at that. What the fuck's in there? [Both] Oh! Forget about that. The question is, what's in there? We need to find that key. Come on, fucker. Oh! - [Door clanging] - [Gasps] - [Cat yowls] - Fuck! Goddamn cat. [Screaming] What the fuck are you doing? [Screaming] - [Grunts] - [Screams] [Grunts] [Screaming] Let me go, you cocksucker! Oh, god, no! No, no, please don't! Please don't! Ah, no, no, please don't! Oh, shit! [Screaming] [Screams] [Telephone ringing] [Answering machine] Hi, you've reached Abby. Please leave your name and number and a brief message and I'll get back to you just as soon as I can. [Machine beeps] Grandma, are you there? Please pick up. I'm sorry I hung up on you. I really need to talk to you. I am at Mrs. Garrett's house, and... And something really strange is going on. [Cat meows] [Screeching, crunching] I'm gonna go check on her. - Let me change. - No. - Wait here. - No. Look, Sarah's gonna be back any second, and she will freak out if we're both gone. Okay, but I just need a picture of me in this dress. So hurry back. [Cricket chirping] Come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant oh, come ye oh, come ye to Bethlehem come... grandma? All right, bitches. I'm coming for you. [Dog barking in distance] [Cat yowls] [Muffled scream] Ugh! [Whimpers] [Grunts] [Grunts] Leave me... No, no, please. [Screaming] Ahh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! - [Stabbing] - [Sobbing] [Telephone ringing] [Ringing] Hello? Hey, Rachel, I'm glad you answered. Cody, I don't have time to talk right now. I'm kind of in the middle of something. - I see. - It's nothing like that. Are you okay? Nothing is okay. I can't trust anyone. You can trust me. I found these letters... Romantic letters that were written to my mother a long time ago. Apparently, my mom was having an affair with a married man. So, you think she ran off with him. I didn't get that from the letters. Who was you mom having an affair with? My mom was having an affair with Mrs. Garrett's husband. [Dog barking] Sarah? [Clock ticking] Thanks for all the cheap chilled wine, Sarah. Fine. I'll drink it by myself. Sarah? S-Sarah? Sarah? [Choking] [Grunts] [Gasping] [Screaming] - [Screams] - [Grunts] [Screams] [Whimpering] [Sobbing] [Screaming] [Screaming] [Crying] [Whimpering] - [Straining] - [Screams] [Shouts] Ugh! [Sobs] [Whimpering] [Exhales] [Sobs] [Choking] [Door opens] Gia? Sarah? [Door closes] Why are the lights out? Gia? Sarah? Come on, you guys. [Cell phone ringing] [Cell phone ringing] I don't know what's going on here. I can't find Gia and Sarah anywhere. Hold on. Slow down. Okay, I need to tell you something. I just found Gia's cell phone upstairs. She never goes anywhere without it. And not only that, but the key is here. I'm sure it's the key that we were looking for. Listen to me. I looked up Mitchell Garrett on the Internet. What? You know, Mr. Garrett? The man your mother was boning? What... what did you find out? There isn't a lot of information except that... He didn't just leave Mrs. Garrett. It says in the early '90s, he was sent to ironwoods state prison. That's not very far from us. Is he still there? There's not much about him, but from the looks of it, he's been there for about 15 years. 15 years? [Rachel] That's about the time that Jamie went missing. There was a police car outside Mrs. Garrett's house earlier this evening. Rachel, you gotta get out of that house. [Cody's voice breaking up] You're breaking up. Do you hear me? Rachel, are you there? Cody! [Door creaking] [Knocking] Ahh! I'm not going to hurt you. [Breakers clicking] Who, who turned on the lights? Jaime has finally come home for the holidays. That's impossible. Who's upstairs? [Gasps] I told you. Jaime. Are you okay, dear? You look sick. No! You don't even know what happened to Jaime. Jaime was five years old when my husband found out the truth about her. He was so disgusted what he found out what Jaime was that he tried to kill her. But I called the police just in time. You see, Jaime was born... [Inhales, exhales] A boy. I was expecting a lovely little girl. So, you can imagine my surprise when I gave birth to a beautiful... Manipulating, perverted... Womanizing man! When I came home from the hospital, I brought Jaime down here. And... Fixed the little problem. It was easy as removing a nasty wart. When my husband was arrested, I was able to convince everyone that he was responsible for the mutilation. But poor Jamie was still taken from me and put in a mental hospital. And that's where she's been her whole life... Until now. She's come home. And she wants me to fix her. [Exhales] Oh, my god. Ah. [Inhales, exhales] You had some of my special holiday eggnog. I told you no one makes it quite like me. oh... [Laughing] Ha. Oh, mommy... [Sighs] I missed you so much. Mom. I right here, baby. [Inhales, exhales] No, no, no, no, no! - Ooh! - You're not my mom! Leave me alone! [Screaming] Oh, my god! [Crying] - Mm. - Wha... wha... What did you do to my mother? Where is my mother? You poor, poor dear. Your mother was a filthy whore. She tried to take my husband... And so I buried the bitch out back in my garden. [Chuckles] [Gasps] [Labored breathing] [Grunts] [Cries out] [Muffled screams] [Muffled screams] [Grunts] Rachel. Come on. I'm gonna get you out of here. Don't worry. I knocked that fucker out cold. [Muffled scream] Cody, hurry. Cody, hurry. He's coming. Cody, hurry! Look out! Look out! Look out! - Ugh! - [Grunting] [Whimpering] No, no, no. - [Bones snap] - Ah! Ahh! Ah! Cody? [Grunts] Cody! Cody, come on. We gotta get out of here. - Now. - I can't run. I can't run. It's my leg. Look, let me help you. [Straining] Ah. [Labored breathing] Cody, I'm gonna hide you in here. You do not make a sound. - [Groaning] - Shh! Shh! Don't worry. I won't leave you this time. I promise. Okay. [Groaning] [Door closes] [Grunts] [Grunts] [Screams] [Screaming] [Grunts] Ugh! [Shouts] [Whimpers] [Muffled screams] - [ Muffled screaming] - Yah! Ooh! [Grunting] Yahhh! [Smacks] Now, you've gone and pissed me off. This... This is for my mother! [Grunting] - Don't! - Take that bitch to the timeout room! No! No! No, no, not the... Take her up there. No, get off me! No! No! No! No, no, no! No, no, please! No! Please, please! No! Ugh! Don't, don't! - Rachel! - Oh, my god, Cody! What are you gonna do to him? Let him go! [Grunting] No! [Crying] Jaime, may I see what you've brought me? What the fuck are you gonna do to me? Oh, my. You've been busy, haven't you? I see you have a variety of shapes and sizes. It's always good to have options. Oh, have, uh... Have you decided which one you would like to use? [Groaning] Ugh! [Maniacal chuckle] What are you people gonna do with me? Let him go! Jaime, will you go get my surgical bag? It's still in my closet. [Laughing] Um. Don't worry. I know Jamie's crazy as a hoot. And I know there is no possible way I could fix Jamie's problem. [Gasps] Or is there? I'm going to do what my husband tried to do years ago. I'm going to put Jamie... Out of her misery. How are you gonna get away with this? My crazy child escapes from a mental institution and comes home to kill me... Only I kill her first. [Gasps] I'll be a hero. [Gasps] And you and I will live happily ever after. You... You were supposed to be mine. That bastard husband of mine got your mother pregnant at the same time he knocked me up. And wouldn't you know it... He gave that bitch a baby girl. That's right. You and Jaime... Are family. Come here. Come here. Now, Jaime... I need to talk to you in private in the living room. Come on. Come on, now. Let's go. Oh, oh, my. I almost forgot. - Ahhh! - [Screaming] No! [Sobbing] [Grunting] I'm sorry, baby. You no longer belong in this world. I only did what I did to protect you. I thought I could save you... Make you better. Oh, Jaime. Why didn't you come back to me like the little girl I knew? I finally see you. And you ain't nothin' but a dickless man. And there ain't nothin' worse than that. - Ugh! - [Moaning] I love you baby. I love you, baby, so much. Ugh! Ahh! [Grunting] Stop it! [Choking] [Straining] [Voices whispering] [Woman's voice] Just before you die. Let's go bury this bitch out back.
