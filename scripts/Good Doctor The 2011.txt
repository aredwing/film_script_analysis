Ended. - Oh, hello doctor. - Doctor is a pleasure to see again. How are you? - Very well, responding to antibiotics. I could die! Right? Just saying that could be serious. But this completely under control. You say that if I had not come to hospital in time, be dead? I did not say that. It's amazing to know how to save people that way. I bet you an even, know the name of this. - Philtrum! - I told you I knew it! - Hello! - Hey Rich. Hello Mrs. Nixon. He is my doctor said I could have died. - Doctor Blank? - Hey.

This tab is not even original... I do not know what you mean. The original tab says NKAA, analysis. Well, Would you ask? Speak English, why you give penicillin? Because you're the doctor, and I do what you say. - Ok, traigmosle a... - I took care of that. - Thank you. - Where are you going? - To make an incident report. - Why?

Hello beautiful, here I leave you this gift. Is this seat taken? Look, look, look. Hey Nancy, Will you sit here? So always. - Excuse me, excuse me a second. - Yes, no problem. Doctor Waylans, I can speak a second? Insurance. I wanted to ask about incident reports. Is this thing on Mr. Sanchez? Do not worry about that. But do not go on my record? That's bad. I think not, I say, not a good thing. It would affect my application for scholarship studying infectious diseases? I can not undo it, if that is what you mean. It looks good. Perfect wanted to discuss it. You know, because I'm sick and I'm in the hospital, if you have not noticed. Oh, please, you're an idiot! Go to hell. I'm improving. So it seems. All right? Do you remember Rich? Should end with him. - Do you have to end it? - It's not my business. This is the most popular in school. I was never the kid more popular in school. And now... I am a doctor. - What will you do? - Do not know. He's an idiot. It's hard to end it because we been together a while. I mean, I do not know if I love or something. You know what they say. What? If you love someone, set them free. - Who says that? - Sting. - What are you laughing? - Who? Excuse me, doctor? I'm with a patient. I can not make these orders until they are reviewed. Do not close the door. Do not close the door. Hello Doctor! - Is having a rough day, right? - No, I'm fine. Do not worry, I feel the same. Every day is a fight, only to out of bed in the morning. What floor is, doctor? This is a hospital, the staff is supposed to follow orders, right? Do doctors do not receive a little respect? I do not know, perhaps, probably not what you think. I just want things to be as they are supposed to be. How long have you been working here, Teresa? Do not you taught to deal with people like in medical school? Just ignore them and do not follow the current. And then, bam! A heart attack! Too bad! Just kidding, Doc. I think I know what I was thinking. - Hello. - Hello. How do you feel? - Well I guess. What about that nurse? That was a misunderstanding, All is well. Should not dismiss her, or something, by yelling at a doctor? Probably. But I mean no problems. Am I cured? Almost. No more hospital? No. Will you give me some advice? Everyone says you're a good doctor. Maybe I should leave. Thank you. You're a good patient. Let's see, next. No pain, no stitches, she can go from here. Only one more day, to be sure. No, I gave him high. Mr. Sanchez... - Hello, is Dr. Diane? - Yes I am the parent of D BC, thanks for everything. - I just came to say goodbye. - My wife has just brought the car. Any last minute advice? To take your pills and is like new. Ok, we will. My daughter took a shine with you. Fairly well cared for and... I wanted you to invite dinner at home on Friday. Friday? - Yes, on Friday would be fine. - Great. You will have then. See you there, at 8 o'clock on Friday. Hi Diane, you feel better? How do you feel? Mr. Nixon, Mrs. Nixon. - Is the doctor? - Yes, hello. Hello, happens! Welcome to our home. - Oh, recalls Valerie, right? - Hello, I love your jacket. - Thank you. - He is our youngest son, Donny. - Hello? - What is it? Not much! Sit down please. - Where is Diane? - Left. I told him to stay, so they do not seems spoiled. For in truth, We are very grateful, but... He's talking to Rich. How is being a doctor? Lots of work, a lot of responsibility, but I like it. - How many operations a week ago? - I still hospitalized. - What is that, as a test? - Dony, not in the table. Let's mom I can not say anything? I do not think it is just that. I bet they pay very good doctors. Donny, please. It's less than you think, but is much more than he earned at home. In addition, he earns more than you, Donny. Besides the money comes, when you enter to a private, right? - Have a nice house? - Yes, okay. - On the beach. - Oh, I love the beach. You're so lucky! I want to live... on the beach, and know as much on the human body. You seem like... Do not be stupid! Valerie! - Mom! - He started it! - Mom this was new! - As he drops cum! No! Look you know what necessity you do, right? Honestly, Donny! - I'm so sorry doctor! - Okay. Can I use your bathroom? Sure, it's down the hall in his right hand. What mom? it's not like a doctor had never heard sperm. A thousand apologies. Ok, that's all. Release tables. Blake, Can we talk a minute? Clear. Sit down, please. Well, how's it going? Very good. Yes, all right? A little. Are you happy? Want some coffee? No, no thanks. I think we can talk about your residence. If this is about Mr. Sanchez... I just wanted to talk of something more general. Tell me something Martin? When was the first time you wanted to be doctor? - When? - Yes Makes a long time ago, I guess. - Do you know why? - Why? Because... A friend of my mom was a doctor and, was quite respectable, and... I guess I always have thought that, respect. And helping people. Yeah, well, people change by all sorts of reasons. Sometimes I do not believe or think about it, until they are here, face to face With all this, some sometimes realize... who are stressed, are long hours and... the nature of work is not they thought it would be. It is not unusual for people to see that maybe this... - Not what you want after all. - This is what I want. I can learn more, I just take something time to learn your system. Actually I had no advantage growing up or going to school. So sometimes I have to work harder, and I do. But some of the nurses... I thought we had a career in chemical biology. That nurse is me like a foolish child. Does not seem fair, but... I do want to be here. Hi Martin, I am Valerie Nixon, was very nice to see you the other night. Too bad you have had to go so fast. My mom bought you a bag of gifts, but give it forget. So I do not know if you want to arrange a time to come and pick it up. Or it could leave the hospital. Or your department, if you want... So call us, I'll be home tonight. Ok, bye! - Oh, Doctor Blake, forward, - Thank you. - I can bring some coffee or something? - No thanks. - Valerie called, did he mention that there was something I could collect? - Yes. - But I hope in the hospital. - Oh, right! - Could I use your bathroom? - Certainly! Do you remember where is it? Oh, here. - Thank you. - It's something to thank him. Thanks again Doc! Are there any instructions Diane special? Only you finish your medicine. I thought it was just laziness, being much time at home. I told you is Pyelonephritis. I thought it was better. So it seemed. We will do some analysis to be sure. But there are some resistors that are difficult to treat. Hey, Doc. It's nice to have that pretty girl back in 324 right? I do not think it is good that speak well of the patients. Oh, I should not do it? What is this? This is nonsense! - Forgot to give you something, Doctor? - No. This is something else. See? was no reaction penicillin, it was my mistake. It seems that all is well, it happens... When someone does not administers the medicine well. I'm not surprised because I never told Teresa anything about these things. We will review, How is everything? That girl Nixon, do you turn? Yes, said he took all his medicines. I will do a resistance test, just to be safe. Very good, keep up the good work. - You can not zoom out. - So it seems. Sorry. I do not. Do not want to go back to school? Rich? Now the virus is stronger. You'll be fine, soon. Do I have to? I'm so sorry, doctor. - Excuse me. - I'm sorry. They just say goodbye, will not be here for anyone else. I missed the vincomizen Mr. Sanchez. I changed the sheet, and just panicked. I just feel sorry for having harmed to a patient. - Where was Teresa? - No, she did not know anything about it. Oh, so sorry, I'll help. Okay, I'm sorry. Sorry doctor. Good morning. Good morning. - How do you feel? - Same, I guess. I uploaded a little temperature. I do not feel so bad. Not bad, but you may have to stay a day or two. Is that bad? No, okay, while you are coming to see me. God Hey, Doc We were here, talking. - Did this woman is in the hospital? - It's all good, brother. It's just a fun friend, just she is fine. Mandy, tell the doctor you're okay. Doctor, I'm fine. What does down here, doc? Is there something that can help? Just leave here. Very well have to return you, Mandy. Good job, doc. Son of a bitch. - What are you doing here, at midnight. - Yes, just had to finish some things. The patient has been a difficult case. - Is everything all right? - Yes, everything is fine. Go home to rest, Doc My big concern is a access, or some kind of bacteria. Oh, that's weird, resistance we have seen this. Nomenzar would with a pair of analysis. If not begin to stabilize, we have to move to ICU. Keep it under surveillance, How often the vigils? - Every two hours. - Ok, let me know if you spend more. What does that mean? That your condition is a little more hard we thought. We must ensure the antibiotic, which you are enduring. What is that? - An infection intravenal. - A intra what? The fluid is blood. Is that serious? It can be. I did not think that doctors had to do that. I do not mind it. If I have to operate, Would it be you that I operate? I do not trade. I do not want to cut people. The latter in internalized. - I did my job, right? - It's what you do. I do not want to talk. Expected. I think too. Need descanzar. I know. - I can help? - Yes, I look for Diane Nixon. I'm afraid I can not see you now. Look friend had a great fight, I have only see two minutes. Not a good idea, let alone only a little longer. Need descanzar. Can you give this? Insurance. You should be sleeping. I can not. What does the expert? He said it is a difficult case, but we to work together on it. Everything will be fine. There's something I did not say. Before you return to the hospital. I do not know if all goes to make I get sick again. What happened? Rich had sex with before finish the medication. Could that have affected my situation? I think that was what happened. But do not think that you will re sick. Sometimes you do things he knows he should not. But I just can not avoid. Yes. I not die, right? No. Of course not. I always thought that if I was going to die, would not until... die if someone shoot me stopping a crime, or something. I know it's stupid. Did you ever think you in such things? When I was younger, maybe. It's silly. What imagined? I was thinking of entering the ocean and disappear as if it never existed. And the world would be without me. I love the ocean. I'm not sure have seen something like this before. It is a difficult case. I have seen this virus, but had never seen one as resistant to everything. Have you been doing regular rounds seeing if there is another virus? - Or something more advanced? - I considered that, but nothing is... Nothing has gone to 100%. I'm very happy, he did everything what I would do in a case. What has been administered properly? Yes. Well Martin... seems to have landed in a rather difficult. I did a protocol to treat it. Hell, I should have left in my car! - I left it up, would you mind? - No. - No, that's fine. - A silver Mercedes. Back Fast! - You will not feel anything, does not hurt. - Will you see me, when you want? Yes. So you're going to see the inside my heart? Hey! How do you feel? Right. Just a little odd. They are putting you drug in the blood. What's in pain? No, the truth is strange, I feel good. I can ask you a question? Of course. You're not married, or have a girlfriend or something? Why you ask? Why not? You know how people are. Yes? For a while I thought you liked my sister. No. Good, because it is a bitch. You do not want a girl like that. - I know, I did it myself. - Where is it? Excuse me, who? - Diane Nixon! - She was taken for an MRI. - I see it. I do not know what you mean. Where is it! Doctor Blake. - Doctor Blake. - Yes Sorry about yesterday, Nixon for the girl. He seemed friendly. It was, thanks. - Doctor Blake? - Yes? The Doctor is waiting Waylans in conference room 3. You wanted to see me? Yes, Martin. Sit. Is it the first time this has happened? Yes. I never wanted to happen, just... I had it under control. Well talk to Sally, she is a psychiatrist. Hello, Martin. It's always hard to lose a patient. Especially the first time. Do you question it? Wondering if you made mistakes? If you missed something? If you could be faster. These things happen. It is the other part of being a doctor. If there is anything you want to express... please do not keep it. I can ask you a question? Ok. Did you cry today? I did, yes. Very good. That is good. - Mr. Nixon. - I have to talk to the doctor. - You killed my baby. - Ok. Mr. Nixon, really sorry for her loss, but can not come here... - And start to accuse my doctors - That bastard killed my daughter. Is there a problem, sir? She was fine, then came here and he killed her. Martin, let me handle this, that Mr. infection was very difficult to treat. It was very rare, if she had not taken all your pills... That could have given more power to infection, do not know. She took her pills, told me. Do not blame the dr. Blake, supervised throughout the case in everything he did. We did everything we could, However, all of us. Lord, please Am I with? - Sir? - Let go, go alone. Bastards. It's all good, man. It is enough to have to deal with guilt. It was a tough one. Do not worry, they say you're not a doctor... really until lose to a patient. Hey, you look like one of "Scrubs" Hey, wait! How are you, Mr. Granger? Do not listen to Mr. Granger truth, crazy bastard. You must be relieved that you could passing notation. It seems that the last was quite difficult. One of the things unfortunate to be a doctor. Dealing with losses. That's being a doctor, right?. So it seems. You know what I thought it would the best part of being a doctor? Women. They love to doctors. - Do you already have a lady with you? - By the way, yes. No, what do you mean? Come, come and see. - What is it? - Well doctor, I wanted to ask you a question. On the relations between staff and patients. That woman in the room supplements? Forget it. No, that's not my question, I am more interested in such a situation. Let's say a guy like me, who likes to party. A standard rate, regardless of my age. One day he decides to change everything. Before there was a girl, but just death, as this guy... takes the mattress, and to his surprise... find a book under it. Well, there are some things about a Dr. young... It seems they had something special. My question is this: Think is wrong, ethically, this situation... the fact of staying with this book... or give to superiors. Let's take a walk. Where do we go? Another reason would be doctor, for prescribe me a better time. I leave party and no one will see this. I can not do that. Well there is always a way, right? Doctor? I have a question about this. - What is it? - I can read it. It is something that has to do with Mr. Granger. Yes, you may do it, then yes. Ok, fine, I just wanted to check it. - Need Help? - No thanks. - What bothers you? - What? That is for the stomach. And that's more for sneezing. I know, Im a doctor. Ok... Sorry. What? - They are difficult to obtain. - I hope this is what I ordered. Yes, well. - What's the book? - What about him? - When you give me? - You want it? We will not do this then. I believe there is another option, doctor. Now switched to decaf? Health. I told you that the rotations were not so difficult. This time of year everything is easier. Martin! I'm sorry about your patients. - It was a difficult case. - Yes, it was. I was doing a study on these resistant virus, was waiting... who may want help to review this virus, in particular. If you saved your notes and cards. I heard that you are applying for research grant. Yes. I think it's a good idea. Very good idea! What's up, Doc? - Is this the patient? - Yes - James. - Yes I would like to talk to you when you have time. Yes, I leave in 30 minutes. Clear. Hey, buddy. Got it? It looks different. Is morphine. It's better than normal, I want the book. Yes.. I will soon. Really? No, it will not work for me just keep bringing me things. Have fun! You know I will! What are you doing? You can not take it here. Why not? I'm out of service. You should not drive with that in the system. I have who takes me. What's up friend? Do not do like a big deal. We are all human beings. What are you doing? Do not follow me. - I'm just walking. - Stay away from me! You're doing this more rare than that has to be, friend. You know what? - Want more? - Yes, sure. - What is happening? - I do not know, some kind of infection! Call someone! I have it, I have. Jimmy, Jimmy! Can you hear me? Jimmy, I'm Dr. Waylans! Jimmy! Jimmy, stay with me! Jimmy! Stay with us. - He was sick or something? - Do not know. He went into some kind of attack, I tried to help. I would not be surprised if some type of drug overdose. What makes you think that? These symptoms are very normal. Some nurses were account may be abusing drugs. We had a scan, to confirm. Maybe you should go home, relax, returns to be a doctor on Monday. Is it OK? Yes. Ok, ok if this detective Doctor goes home? Well... yeah, I guess. If you have any other questions or... I do not know, we could be in contact if you do not mind. Not at all. - Dr. Blake? - Yes Detective Brown of the hospital. Said he could talk to you if had more questions. Sorry well come without warning. Course, pass. - I can get you anything? - No thanks. It seems that the pills Mr. Vega taken, were mixed with potassium. Do you know what that is? - No. Well, something that I know. Some people suspected who abused drugs. - Seems to have had a bad patch. - I see. I mean, did not know him so well, perhaps know to tell if you know better. Greeted him. - Have you ever saw him taking drugs? - No. I hardly knew him, as I said. Do you have a pen I can borrow? Thank you. - Did you know him too little? - Yes, very little. Not even that. I mean, he was... not my type of person. Do you know where could drugs have gotten? - Do you think got into the hospital? - No, they are very careful. Only a doctor can prescribe. Do you know a Doctor he could deal given? Theoretically, a doctor can... make a prescription false for a patient... but it would be unethical, so do not. So... Did a doctor may have achieved something? No! Do you know a doctor who may have had any relationship with him? What? No, do not know. As I said, I did not care much, so do not go out much with him. Are there any other doctor, maybe he did not like? Or they could have altered the pills... - With the... - Cyanide of potassium. Look, I'm sorry if you it seems distracted. I understand. It must be difficult to return to normal after seeing someone die like that. Yes. has been... Especially with it. Who? No one. Only one patient of mine who died. He had a rare infection. He started up his infection, very rare. And in the end could not hold your body. It was a difficult case, all are agree with that. Not to sound a maniac but... was not a good person, he grotezcos comments to patients. I think I even could have had something to some. As a doctor, you can not do that. Diane was a very pretty girl. We were very close. In a way, with a ratio of doctor / patient before he died. But that's over and I can back to being a doctor. Is it a beautiful day, right? Well you know where I am detective. If you have further questions. Excuse me. - Doctor? - A second! - Is there a problem? - No, no, no! All right! Sorry, I have to collect some things I need in the hospital. Do you have any other questions? I'm afraid I'm a little late. Well, no... I guess not. I'll let him get ready then. - Thanks for your help doctor. - The pleasure is all mine. WBC 1237 at 10:49 is in prospect yet. I gave him some antibiotics, I am by give him his third dose. - Time to put the time to 101. - Yes - Will it hurt? - A little. But do not worry, improved each time, make a fist. - Doctor! - Yes?
