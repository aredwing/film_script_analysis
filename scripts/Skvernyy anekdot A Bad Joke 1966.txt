I must admit, Ivan Illich, I still can't understand what you are getting at. You are extolling humanity. Does it mean love of fellow men? Let it be love of fellow men. Love of fellow men has always been there. But reforms cannot amount solely to it. Different issues have arisen: legal, economic, financial, moral ones. And there is no end to those issues. And all of it together can engender significant, I would say, unrest. That is what we are worried about, not just humanity. The issue is much more profound. I do understand. But I daresay, Semyon Ivanovich, that I will not fail to keep up with your understanding of profoundness of things. However, I daresay, Stepan Nikiforovich, that you too have not understood me. I haven't? Exactly. Let's take a syllogism. I'm humane, therefore I'm loved. I'm loved, therefore I'm trusted. I'm trusted, therefore I'm believed in. I'm believed in, therefore... What I mean is that reforms will also be believed in. They will be embraced, their very essence will be grasped. We can't take it. What do you mean? I mean, we can't take it. We can't take it, you say. At least, I can be sure about myself. We have been here for too long. It's time to leave. This ugly story happened exactly at the moment when began with such uncontrollable power and with such touching naive impulse the renewal of our beloved motherland and its valiant sons' urge towards new destiny and new hopes. Damn! Where is Trifon with my carraige? Varlam, have you seen the carriage of His Excellency? It was standing right there, and the next moment it was gone. What a git. He begged me to allow him to go to some girl. Rascal. Somewhere around here, on Petersburg Side. I strictly forbade him to leave. And I bet that's where he has gone. That's right, he's gone there, but he promised to be back in time. I had a feeling this would happen. I'll show him. Have him flogged a couple of times in the barracks. That will teach him to follow orders. Don't worry, Semyon Ivanovich. I can give you a lift if you want. Good night. Merci. No, thanks. I will show you. Git. I will go on foot to spite. Then you will feel... Then you will have, so to say, guilty conscience. He will come back and discover that his master had to go on foot. What retrogrades they are, those people. We can't take it. What did he mean by that? The main thing is that I'm deeply convinced - if I'm humane, then the man is mine, he is caught... whatsitsname... in the net. And then I can do with him anything I want, I mean... for his own good. And this Semyon Ivanovich, what an ugly mug he has! No way! Flog him yourself, I will not flog anyone. I will punish Trifon with word. Then he will feel... humanity... Go away, beggar! Listen, brother. Whose house is it, brother? Official Pseldonimov's, the registrar. Pseldonimov? Ah, that Pseldonimov! Is he getting married? He is, Your Excellency. With titular counsellor's daughter. Titular counsellor Mlekopetayev served in the town council. This house is a part of the bride's dowry. So it's Pseldonimov's and not Mlekopetayev's house now? It is indeed, Your Excellency. It was Mlekopetayev's. Not it's Pseldonimov's. I'm asking you, brother, because I'm his superior. I'm the general of the place he serves in. Given present relationships within the society, for to me visit my subordinate would mean defiance of the ideas, confusion. Your Excellency! Hello, my dear friend. I was passing by and thought, "Why don't I pay a visit to my subordinate? Why don't I see how my officials entertain themselves and get married?" It's an honour, Your Excellency. Wish me something, Your Excellency. Be happy, my child. Bravo! Maman. Papa. Staff captain, retired. The nephew of His Highness. Why has the music stopped? I wouldn't like in the least to interrupt the fun. Carry on dancing. Mr Mlekopetayev, the staff captain, and I will look at you. Music! Well, it's time for me to leave. Your Excellency, don't go. Business. Business. I will come back in nine months to be a godfather. He is strict as a boss, but as a person he is an angel. To His Excellency - hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! What can be easier and more elegant than such a deed. For I will morally restore the humiliated, I will return him to himself. He will tell his children about how the general himself feasted and even drank at his wedding. This is the crux of the matter, Stepan Nikiforovich. Yes, Your Excellency! So we can't take it? We'll see. What is it, Lord? Nowadays, the dead are sent by railway. There are people whom it doesn't suit to wear clean underwear. I'm one of them. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Let's play! I'm begging you, let's play! All their "female question" is nothing but lack of originality. The female question was invented by men. He told me the day before that I had complications. And suddenly I realized. How do you like it? Gentlemen! You have a distinct disposition to hydrophobia. Mesdames! Messieurs! Geneva lake gives you toothache. It's such a quality. His Excellency has been called His Excellency for only four months. Renewing Russia winked at him and beckoned. His Excellency liked to assume parliamentary postures, and every now and then he dreamt about monuments, especially when his haemorrhoids became acute. Parasites! Damn spongers! Parasites! Hello, Pseldonimov, do you recognize me? Your Excellency. Exaclty. I, brother, have got here completely by accident, as you probably imagine yourself. You will not banish me, surely? Whether you like it or not, you have to receive the guest. Have I interrupted something? I can leave. Your Excellency, for goodness' sake, it's an honour. Have a seat, please. Akim Petrovich Zubikov served as a head of department in the office of His Excellency. It was a man meek as a chicken, a man of the old school, raised on the idea of servility. To Pseldonimov's wedding he was invited as a guest of distinction. Please. There's no need, for goodness' sake. I'd better stand. Do have a seat. You needn't worry. I will sit here. Can you imagine? I have just been to Stepan Nikiforovich Nikiforov's. You may have heard of him. He is a privy councillor in the committee. He is your neighbour now. Anyway, I am walking, and the night is so beautiful and quiet. And suddenly I hear music playing and stomping of feet. Dancing! I inquire of a policeman. It's Pseldonimov's wedding. You, brother Pseldonimov, give balls on a truly large scale. What now? Is he a fool or something? All I need here is a smile, and everything would go like a dream. So I think to myself, "Why don't I pay a visit to my subordinate?" He will not banish me, after all. Whether you like it or not, you have to receive the guest. Porfiri Petrovich, introduce me to your young wife, to your bride-to-be, as it were. Come on, brother. Very, very pleased to meet you. Especially on such an occasion. The bride has wanted to get married for a long time. She has never had any girlfriends, as well as brains. Although she once attended some German school, she didn't learn almost anything except the basics. She especially enjoyed pinching. Pseldonimov! She is very pretty. Quite a couple! Although, she could at least get embarrassed. Then I would be able to tell a joke. Instead, I have come up against a brick wall. Gentlemen! Have I, by accident, interrupted your entertainment? We will start in a moment. And for now... we're just having a rest. Don't be hard on us, Your Excellency. As you haven't shuned us and did us the honour of attending our son's wedding, then, please, be so kind as to congratulate the newlyweds. Don't shun us, do us the honour. So you are... your son's parent? She is indeed, Your Excellency. I wish you, madam, and you, my friend Porfiri, I wish you absolute and long happiness. Our old women are simply fabulous. She has enlivened everybody. I have always loved the people. Porfiri... Un homme trs mal lev. Oui, oui. Porfiri, tell me please - I have wanted to ask you about it in person for a long time - why your surname is Pseldonimov and not Pseudonimov. It must be Pseudonimov. It's must be that his father made a mistake in papers when taking service. And so he remained Pseldonimov. It happens. Exaclty. Exactly. Because, judge for yourselves, Pseudonimov comes from the literary word "pseudonym". While... While Pseldonimov doesn't make any sense. Sheer foolishness. Sheer foolishness what? The Russian people sometimes out of sheer foolishness change letters and pronounce in their own way. For example, they say "nivalid" instead of "invalid". Right, nivalid. They also say "niss", "niss" instead of "miss". Stop badgering him. What? I'm only talking. Or, maybe, I can't even talk? His Excellency has got loaded. The general is out of sorts. What do you mean out of sorts? I mean exactly that, in a drunken state of mind. Our general is drunk. Who is it? I don't know. The general is drunk. ...They float in the air just like this. And all that was discovered by captain Cook, the seafarer. Music! Gentlemen, please! I have news, gentlemen. One moment. One moment, gentlemen. Can I have your attention, please? One moment, please. I have news. You Porfiri, don't have to be shy. If you have some issues concerning orders and so on, then please... So, Your Excellency? I don't really know... I don't really know whether... After all, I have got here by accident. Allow me to introduce myself... And, of course... some might consider it inappropriate, as it were, for me to be present at such a gathering. But I hope, you understand why I am here. I have not come here to drink wine, after all. I am here to encourage, as it were, to show, as it were, the moral, as it were, purpose. Your Excellency, I... Porfiri! Bravo! Porfiri! Lend me 2 roubles, please. Mesdames! Messieurs! Lend me 2 roubles, please. Oui. Not a single centime. You don't have a life line. Do I exist? Very strange indeed. Listen, are you my friend or not? Am I your friend? Haven't I proved it by being here? In that case, lend me 2 roubles. What for? I absolutely have to buy champagne for my general. So will you give it to me or not? I won't give it to you because I don't have it. But even if I did, I still wouldn't give it to you. Because your general is a retrograde. Louise! Louise! Attention! I have news! News, gentlemen! I have no money. Not enough. Thief! Bitch! Maman! Maman! For Christ's sake, maman, I need two more roubles! What? Two roubles... It's an honour... To buy champagne. Champagne then? Champagne is good. It turns out, you have good taste. You just can't live without champagne. I'm not asking it for myself. It's for the general. Parasites! Damn spongers! Your friend Pseldonimov is raging, he demands money. Where would I get any? What money, for God's sake? Hush! You, womenfolk! Too much talk. Step aside. Dad. Porfiri. Two steps forward. So then, Porfiri, you receive generals. That's what it is about. It appears, you are trying to put yourself above me. You say you're better than that, you don't want to know us anymore since you've befriended a general. Mlekopetayev is not good enough for you. Dad... Shut up! I am your general! Not him! I am! You hear? I am! Dad! I will pray for you day and night. I need two roubles, please. Dance for me. No, not good enough. We need music. Sing for him. Go ahead! Dad... Dad. They are dancing, let them dance. But don't even think about feeling too sorry for him, gentlemen. Of course, he is suffering, but at the same time, he feels some base shameful delight and, horribile dictu, enjoyment. Yes, gentlemen, enjoyment. And I stand by that. The need for this secret and disgraceful enjoyment of slavery is a trait of each Pseldonimov alone and all Pseldonimovs of all times. The Tree of Good has the good fruit. The Tree of Evil has the evil fruit. The tree shall be known by its fruit. How can viperous brood tell the word of good? Bravo! Let's take a syllogism. Morality... Madam! Akim Petrovich. I'm here. Porfiri! Your Excellency, do us the honour, come to the table. I'm don't really know... I was going to leave. Do us the honour. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Do come to the table. Enough. Your Excellency, do us the honour, do not shun us, poor people. Do come to the table, Your Excellency. I have become older not by the quantity of the years gone by, but by their quality. You told me to shave off my whiskers because they lack patriotism, and I did it. Gentlemen, allow me to propose a toast. Gentlemen! Now a kiss! Excuse me, but I am, as it were, a fanatic of love of fellow men. I'm writing a will. What and to whom do you bequeath? Due to the impossibility of being Russian, I've become... They wanted to take him to court, but then noticed he was insane... I think that tomorrow I might suffer a stroke of falling sickness. I like philosophizing. I love speaking and I'm good at it, but I warn... No, that's no good. And not appropriate as well. I should have left. And not just left, I should have fled. No, I won't leave. I have to discover the moral purpose. I will talk about issues, reforms and about the greatness of Russia. I'm writing a will. I've discovered it. The moral purpose. I will engage them. Maybe, nothing is lost yet. But what should I say to engage them? What method can I devise? I'm simply at a loss. What do they want? What are they demanding? And what do I want? Why am I here? Why am I not leaving? What am I trying to achieve? Why don't people dare to kill themselves? What keeps them from doing it? Two things. Only two reasons. One of them is very small. Other one is very big. But even the small one is also very big. It is pain. And the big one is God. Do you know what God is? God is pain in the fear of death. But that doesn't matter. My friend, I got off the ground and started moving. Where I was moving - this I don't know. The only thing I know for sure is that I was moving. Champagne, gentlemen! At first, it seemed to me that before that there could have been a lot. But then I realized that even before there was nothing as well. It only seemed that way. Little by little, I came to know... And to the left. ...that never nowhere and nothing will be. Then I stopped being angry. My dear good friends. Of course, His Excellency thought that as a gentleman he is on equal footing with them and he needs no special signs whatsoever. But at the right moment he will remind that between him and them there is a difference. Like heaven and earth. Because he is father and they are children. Yes, gentlemen, he is father and they are children. Yes, I'm a funny man. They now call me insane. But it's a promotion in rank. I think it was very good, and pretty scary too. I bequeath my skin for a drum. I will get what I want by sincerity. I will reveal everything to them. I will amaze them. Please, help yourself. They will fill their glasses to the brim and drink for my health with a cry. Yes, Your Excellency! I am an officer. I am sure about it. He will break his glass with a spur. One could even cry "Hurrah!" Hurrah! Even if they wanted to chair me like hussars do, I wouldn't object to that. It would be absolutely fine with me. But they don't have this high-society lustre, they don't have this, as it were, cordial delicacy. But I... I will tell them... I will tell them about the destiny of modern Russia. I will also mention the agricultural issue. And... And they will all love me. They already love me. And I will be famous... Why do you stick cotton into your ears? Are you hard on hearing? On the contrary, I like silence. I already told... Gentlemen, I already told Akim Petrovich just now that Russia... Russia, only Russia at the moment is going through... Only Russia... Gentlemen! To cut the long story short, you know what I mean. ...is going through, I am deeply convinced in that, a period of humanity. And what if I spoil their shoes to get to know how people feel about me, and what facial expressions they have up there. What if I stay here? What if I'll never get out of here? Despite shame and disgrace, I'll sleep right here. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Your Excellency! All our lives all we do is respect you unconditionally. We say this on the part of the whole community. Thank you. Music! Humanity... Love of fellow men... To return the man to himself... To revive, as it were, one's sense of dignity. And then, with the material ready at hand, get to work. Gentlemen! Let's take a syllogism. All night I dreamt of a monkey. And only in the morning I dreamt of a rope. Quite a significant dream. I've decided to bequeath my skeleton to the Academy, but only on condition that on its forehead there will forever... Humanity... ...be stuck a label. Recently... Recently, I've already said... Recently... ...that humanity, as it were, the revival of things... Your Excellency! Your Excellency! What do you want? Nothing at all, Your Excellency. Go on. ...as it were, the revival of things... Stop shouting! Or I'll have you thrown out. Just like that... Do go on. I'm listening to you. And I couldn't agree more. It's laudable. They are just drunken boys. I can see they are drunk. It's a conspiracy to bring disgrace on the wedding. Your Excellency, I've just been talking about one lieutenant who used to add "It's laudable" to every word of his superiors. Anyway, he's trying to imitate him now. They wanted to bring him to court, but then noticed he was insane. They proved it medically, Your Excellency. So they conducted an autopsy? He was absolutely alive. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! I... I totally understand that they don't dissect a live person. I just assumed that in his insanity he wasn't alive anymore. I mean, he died. Porfiri, I... I see that all of you... I'm asking all of you, what have I done to abase myself? Your Excellency! Have mercy! Porfiri! Porfiri, I'm asking... I'm asking you, tell me... I've come to the wedding... It's an honour. I've come to the wedding and I had an aim. I wanted to morally restore... I wanted you to feel... I'm asking everybody... Have I abased myself in your eyes or not? Yes! Yes! You have. Yes, your are a retrograde! Young man, come to your senses! Who do you think you are talking to? I'm talking to you! And besides, I'm not a young man. You've come here to put on airs and seek popularity. Yes, you've come to boast your humanity. I suspect that you are one of those bosses who are lustful for young brides of their subordinates. Pseldonimov, what's going on? You are not a general, you are nothing! Pseldonimov! One moment, Your Excellency! Don't worry! Bastards! Scoundrels! Creatures made for ridicule! Bastards! I'm grateful, but independent! Bastards! It's servility, gentlemen! How spectacular, gentlemen. Even risky. And what did you expect? For the malignant employee of a satirical column was partly even a romantic. But that's the snag, gentlemen. The main characteristic of the romantic of our contry is undoubtedly denying everything, reconciling oneself to nothing but also yielding to and evading everything, treating everyone politicly, never losing sight of a useful practical purpose, namely government housing, pension, rewards and medals, seeing this practical purpose through all the enthusiasm and lyrical poetry. Our romantic is the first cheater of all cheaters. Numerous romantics with time get promoted to the highest ranks. Rascals. They suddenly manifest such a flair for reality that astounded superiors and public are left gaping at them with their mouths open. Your Excellency! I'm ruined. Your Excellency! I wanted, as it were, to christen... Your Excellency! And now it's over... Stop laughing! Wait! Listen! Vanya, wait! We need a doctor, Vanya! Forget about a doctor! Quick! Go get a cab. I bequeath my skin for a drum. ...and those to whomsoever the Son shall reveal. Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is excellent, and my burden is light. Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? But when the Pharisees heard it, they said... Careful! Do as you please, Porfiri Petrovich, but he has to be taken away from here. Carry him. I'm ready to serve under your flattering command. What is it? Everyone's asleep in the coaching inn. They say in this hour even 5 is too little. But we eventually agreed on 3. Quiet! Don't shout. We don't need a cab. His Excellency is in bed. But my friend! We have to pay! I don't have any money. I don't! I don't! You will have to pay yourself. How can I pay? I've never had a penny in my life! The cab is here. Get out of here! Move! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! It's all right. You'll be ok, dear. You'll be ok. Just don't drop him. It's all right. What kind of husband are you after what happened? You are good for nothing after such a disgrace. I'm dead. Who are you? I don't know. Where am I now? There's a draught. Pseldonimov. Bravo! Your Excellency! Music! It's an honour. Pseldonimov! Your Excellency! Pseldonimov! Your Excellency! Whoa! Go away, beggar! Go away! Mr Pseldonimov is getting married, he doesn't like your kind. Merci, Monsieur. But he's a beggar! And drunk too. Give him a penny. No way. He'll squander it on drink right away. Who are you? You're nonentity compared to me. Nobody. Humility, humility. Humility. Don't be afraid, my friend. It's too early. Go to sleep. Wash your face. You can't go out without washing your face. Come on, get out of here. Here's also a request for a transfer to a different department from official Pseldonimov. I'm asking for your kind assistance, Your Excellency. So he is getting transfered. Well, for my part, I have no objections. Tell him... Tell Pseldonimov that I have no hard feelings towards him. None at all. On the contrary, I am ready to forget everything that happened. Absolutely everything. Strictness. Only strictness and more strictness. All that happened already seemed to His Excellency to be nonsense. He has already forgotten that he dreamt of himself as a beggar. What rubbish! On the contrary, he felt total harmony of spirit and moral balance, and somehow everything suddenly fell into place. Once and for all, gentlemen. Firmly. What have you done? What? You've killed him. Who? Pseldonimov. He killed him. It's a murder, gentlemen. But it's a fly. No. It's him. Don't you see it's Pseldonimov? I object. It's a fly. Don't argue, gentlemen. Let's call the mother. She will identify the body. I object. Here you are. You see? What about the wedding? It's not a wedding. There's been a mix-up, gentlemen. It's a funeral. No, it's a wedding. No, it's a funeral. No, it's a wedding. It's a funeral. But, anyway, laugh, gentlemen. It's very funny. It's very funny, I assure you. Maman, I'm alive! Stop laughing! Don't you see, I'm alive!
