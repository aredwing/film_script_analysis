I get it. This was the way you had planned there from the beginning. From the first time I came you knew you'd blow me, right? You think I'm just going to release this? I will take it to court and sue ass. Are you going to sue me? - JW... - You can bet your ass. Who believes in you? You are a convicted drug smuggler. You have even shot people. Are you going to beat me? How many years do you get for it, right? Three? Five? You are over. Do you understand that? What you want can not be bought for money. Do you understand? For that's what we're talking about? Class. Class are born in. Breathe. Berries. Class sits in his eyes. And, JW... You have your father's eyes. And I have my dad's eyes. If you'll excuse me now, I'll go back to my company. - Bowl. - Bowl for us. I would like to propose a toast to Nippe- - who just finished a really good deal . Did you like it? Have you told? Have you told everyone? Has he not told you? - No! It is a brilliant idea. A trading product to eliminate flash trade. There is something beautiful too. Right? It is... Itis something nice. Only problem is that... ...it was not your business plan. Nippe sold my idea. Right, Nippe? If you have so much. And then you take it all I have. But it is not so strange- - for you have gone free ride your dad a lifetime. The rju no strange around this table, right? - Calm down now. - calm me down? No, sit down. But this time wanted to show daddy that you had- - built something private that would have his and the world's respect. With own work. Is that enough? That's enough when I say it. - JW, we go now. - But the thing is, Nippe... You do not know what it means to build up something with their own hard work. You make a fool of yourself. Go here. You do not know what it means to tear that ettjvla animal - when no one wants to know of one! You do not know a fucking shit about! Rolando? Johan! Hi. Hi. I did not know you had come out. It was four months ago. I received parole for good behavior. I have just started working with Nippe again, from Trade. We have developed a business project. No, I developed it in prison. A trading product to be launched. A venture capitalist will go in, so it feels damn good. I think it can be reallylarge. The last time I saw you outside NorrtIje Institution... Do you know what I realized after that? The guy who I loved, the humble, amazing man- - that made me look at the world in another way, he was never found. For everything was just lies, Johan. I have to go now. Calls to you. JW? Are you okay? Are we millionaires? There has never been anyone way back to me. Wheat hell I thought. What are you talking about? - Remember when you said... ...that in our world are all thinking on himself and the cache? - You were right. Can we not take it when you get? What? You will come back? I can not sit for a day there. If it is what you intend to do- - you know that there is someone return. Okay? Let me go with you. I know where there is a shitload of cash. What are you talking about? There is a man who works for Radovan: Misha, Radovan" accountant". He does nothing to draw attention to themselves. He takes care of his little house, cutting the grass. He does not even try to put on neighbor's wife. He is as slippery as an eel. When I worked with Radovan I delivered the money to Misha. Black money rolled into the system. Coming out white as snow to Radovan pockets. whores,strippers, the percentage of the pubs. Kola Cod were around Stureplan. Misha launder money non-stop. And to Radovan... He loves his little cash whore. But there is one thing Radovan not know. Misha is playing cod. He thinks he's smart, he is orrbar. But at Solvalla no one knows who he is. This is where we'll take him. He is our ticket out of here. Angel! Lovisa is dead! Lovisa! Lovisa! Lovisa! Lovisa! Louisa, my angel! My Angel, where are you? - You should call the guy's family. Why? He harju two small children. - I offered him a job. He said yes. That's what happens. See what has become of you. See for yourself. This industry is risky. I make none. We have other problems. We have not dope. How do we do... We are going there to do business. When we are there, they to ask for the goods. We say that we want to see the money first.
