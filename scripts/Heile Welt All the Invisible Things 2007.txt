That'll take way too long. So what! As long as someone stands watch. Common, it'll take forever. Hi! - Hello! We need some detergent advice. - Can help you? Which one is better for us? Depends on what you want to wash. Pretty much everything But especially this... - 'Cause like here... Hey Bunny, that's twice as big as you, you can't take that. This is mild cleansing foam. Mild cleansing foam... If you want to wash everything this one is better. We read the back and it doesn't say anything... Are you done yet? - We're in a hurry. Just a second, sorry. Thank you, have a nice day. Bye! - Keep the change. Thanks, have a nice day. I'd say just try it out I'd say we're not taking it. Then go put it back. - Go stick it up your ass. What's the big idea?

Another guy had his pants open. He was jerking off or something. Where are you? Can we blow this scene, man? Go ahead and come. We're on our way to the park. Yeah, right now. Then see you at the kebab place. Bye. Is everything OK? Can help you? Can drop you off somewhere. That's OK, thanks anyway. Just came here to earn money. Then I'll be moving on to America, the land of opportunities. Saw those little bastards back there. You know what? You should have socked them in the nose, like this. If you tell me where their nose is. Damn! Think the world is full of assholes. Yeah. Do you think they should all be shot? No, don't. Do you? Yes. Sometimes think that would be best. And who decides who the assholes are? Maybe I'm an asshole too. No, no, no, not you! You can just tell. Think that's totally killer! Jolly. Hi, I'm here. Who's that? Can have a bite? I'm hungry. Thanks. Does she need friends? Yeah, totally. You're not from here either? No, I'm from Germany. What brings you to Graz? Common, tell me! Love? Love makes you blind.

I'm busy this weekend and was wondering if Johannes could stay at the boarding school. No, it won't happen all the time. Good, thank you! Good-bye! Did it! What? What? Called. It seems to be standard procedure. As long as it isn't every weekend, she said. Who? - The headmistress. Have the weekend to myself. - That's terrific! You can relax this weekend. You said it. Let's go bar hopping. Tomorrow, OK? I've got plans for tonight. Oh yeah? What? Tell me! Markus! Hi! Do you have a sec? Left Johannes at school this weekend. Can't take it any more, can't take it. Just can't get through to him any more. Don't want to argue with you. Can you pick him up tomorrow? So he's not all alone the whole weekend. No, I'm not owing again. Just happen to be cutting onions. Don't have the nerves for your stupid jokes. Can we just finish planning tomorrow? No, now. Let's plan it now. No, please don't hang up. Don't hang up! Need some downtime now and then too. My boyfriend and his son were alone for six years! How does he respond to you? Suddenly a woman. No problem at all. He's so glad to finally have a little... He doesn't see you as a surrogate mom? Well, it's kind of funny because he does in a way. If he's got a problem... It depends. Sometimes am his mommy if he needs to cw, but then I'm like a friend too, we even go out together. It's really cool. Good combination. Yes, think it's terrific. At first was afraid we'd have problems... That nothing you did would be right? But really got lucky. The other day he said it was great to have me there. Sorry...! Frank! Frank, it's me... Lara. Frank, you forgot your wallet. Hey, pal! Pal... Money... Get Frank! Stop staring and get Frank! Common, tell him to come out... Did...? You forgot it, yes. Thanks. Matter of honor. Sometimes my co-worker has a wild imagination. I'd like to show you something. The most beautiful view you can imagine. Baby, shake your breasts for me! I've forgotten how. Like this! No, to do my makeup! never go out. We'll see to that. What?! It's him! Who? Told you about him. Not the one in the lavender... - Yes! Andrea, that's my boss. - What? Yeah, told you about him too. He's coming over. Girls... What a nice surprise. Join me at my table? - Sure. There's always room for you two. Gobi, how nice, do you come here often? Have a seat. Allow me to introduce: Ms. Paulitsch... We've totally lost track of time. Shall we go? Go ahead! Go ahead. Bye! Shit, what do do now? Stay cool! Good evening! Police. I'm Officer Mittelberger. Good evening. - Good evening. It's OK. Go on. Your son and 2 minors were drunk and playing in a fountain.

Get out! Get out of my flat! Get out! Hello! Hello, open up! Is my son here? Made a huge mistake. sent him away. Is he here with you? You were at my flat just now. My name is Paulitsch, and blew everything Is he here? - Now calm down. Alright, what's wrong? Your fellow officer tried to bring my son home, and didn't want him with me. And then his friends started yelling, and then everyone ran, and think they fired some shots. Is he here with you? We got anything on that? Yes, three minors, armed, on the run... We've got patrol cars out. No, I'm sure my son isn't armed. Please don't hurt him. What's happening to him? What are you doing? Look, calm down, go home, and we'll call you. We're searching for him, we'll call if we find out anything. Do you have my number? I'll leave you my number. Karin! Just a sec. Hurry UP! Just a sec! Yeah, yeah, I'm finished! Where's your key? ...And somewhere out there maybe someone... Jorg? Go! Go to sleep! Mom. Or you're a goner. Honest. Why are you late? You know I'm dependent on you. Can imagine places I'd rather be too. Irresponsible is what you are. Be more gentle. No one should have to put up with you. How can anyone stand this? That hurts so much. And they always just leave you lying here. Could you tell me where this is? Pass it back! Moron! I'm hungry, let's go shopping! Yeah! Shopping! OK, let's go shopping! Yeah, "shopping," you know... Look! Pretty. Mom? No... Please, no! She's resting in peace. Life goes on. Don't know what to do now. For the last two years I've come here every day And now... Go home to your loved ones. You'll be better off with your family. Hi. It's OK. We'll get through this! Who are you? Mr. Paulitsch, if you'll come with me. Yeah, sure... This is my son. Your wife had a serious traffic accident. They told you that, right? She is suffering from polytrauma. We did emergency surgery and during surgery she went into ventricular fibrillation What? Did she... Is she alive? We're doing everything we can for your wife We are monitoring her around the clock. We've given her long-term anesthesia, put her in a kind of coma. And ask you to look at the situation realistically. We'll see how things develop in a few days. Your mom will pull through. She's as tough as an old boot. Common, Jolly! Wait up! Jolly, wait! Klaus? Klaus! Saw you in the park today. Are those your friends? Nice, hm? Guess who died today? Who? Grandma. Come home with me. No, gotta wait for Jolly. See. Can you sleep at home tonight? Please. Promise? I'm gonna go look for Johannes. You gonna wait here? My son. come all the way from Vienna and he runs off. He's always had a mind of his own, just like his mother. This isn't about him. What do you mean? It's never been about him, has it? Bye! Since when do you smoke? Karin. Don't you have a boyfriend? No. No boyfriend at the moment. Why? It's just you must be... You're beautiful, aren't you? You're right. Describe how you look. I'm about 5 feet 8 inches. Think I'd reach about up to here on you. And I've got blond hair, straight hair. You have curls. Have a little bit of a tan. And here, look. May? Look, have lots... have lots of very small hairs on my arm They tickle. Wish the sun would always shine. I'm really ticklish. OK, common! What are you doing? Slow down! Slow. Slow. Why not? May? We're never coming back, you dickwads! Cocksuckers! Frank, Champagne! For me, for you, champagne. Look, can do this... You jerk. Actually don't think I'm allowed to drive like this. Doesn't matter. I'll turn a blind eye. What was that? A bird, think. Translation: Kimi Lum
