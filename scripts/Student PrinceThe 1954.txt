My name is Lutz, and as usual Professor Juttner, you will be late. What can his highness learn from you? A teacher and you can't even tell time. Small minds stick with the clock. His highness is always punctual. That's what I've been trying to do, educate him out of it. I don't know why I bother with you. It's your duty, Lutzy my lad. I only do it to please his highness. His highness' very words to me were "I should esteem it a favor, my dear Lutz, if you could make the professor look more presentable. " And I said, I should esteem it an honor, your highness. Every man is entitled to his honor. Oh, we're late! A most appropriate sermon considering the day. Thank you, your majesty. Permit me to congratulate your royal highness on your forthcoming betrothal. And may I include good wishes for Princess Johanna of North Hausen. Thank you. She will be here tomorrow and you can extend them to her in person. She is as gracious as she is beautiful. This marriage has truly been planned in heaven. Our prime minister is too modest. Von Mark planned it years ago when the princess and I was still children. Of course with your blessings, grandfather. Should your royal highness feel the need of spiritual guidance and comfort, I am at your command. My guidance and comfort have always been the knowledge that I am doing my duty for Karlsburg. Well, Karl. I have taken cared of all the preliminaries, but victory or defeat is in your hands. Tomorrow may well decide the future of our country. So when you propose to the princess, I count on you to carry it out with your usual efficiency. It won't be too difficult. From her pictures, she seems very attractive. And in a receptive mood. Why not? It is true they have the money but we have the blood. They are merchants, we are kings. Oh, I should have worked that subject, my boy. She can afford to be fussy. Don't worry, grandfather. For such a dowry, I'd marry a princess with two heads. Then I need scarcely remind you that our treasury is empty. Our treasury has been empty for 200 years. Yet somehow we have survived. We have survived when other thrones have fallen not because we have been rich, but because the men of our family have always been extremely eligible. Our code of arms reminds us our wealth has been our sons. Sir, when I hold her in my arms, I will do my best for Karlsburg. Her royal highness, the princess Johanna of North Hausen. You know, Ferddie, I believe Karl is even better looking than you were at his age Not at all. My dear, Mathilde, it's just that time has dimmed your memory. Perhaps. But at any rate, they'd make a very handsome couple. I can already see their profiles on the coin. Mother is very impressed with the troop maneuvers today. I'm pleased to hear it. And what did you think of it? After all these years, I still think parades are great fun, don't you? Fun, Johanna? Training our troops is my responsibility, and I assure it's the hardest kind of work. One can't ever let up. I think... that doesn't leave much time for relaxation or for dances like this, does it? Very little. Why? Does my dancing show it? Your highness dances with firmness and precision. But the throne of Karlsburg won't fall if you loosen your knees a bit. Forgive me. I've always considered the parade ground more important than the dance floor. perhaps, one of my junior officer... Everyone is looking at us. I didn't come to Karlsburg to find a dancing partner. Why don't you invite me to see the view from the garden? Here now, this is much better. No one is looking at us. So perhaps we can at last look at each other. It's almost time for us to receive the diplomatic corps of both kingdoms. Let them wait. We owe ourselves a little time together. Surely we'll have plenty of opportunity in the future. I don't consider marriage an introduction. Aren't you curious to know what kind of a person you will spend the rest of your life with? I confess I am. Oh, you needn't be? I shall be a most punctilious and considerate husband. Karl, come here. Look at me. Forget your princely self-possession for a moment. I'm sure that even the great warrior, Frederick the... What's his name? Frederick The Bold. Even he must have had time for other things. After all, he did found the dynasty. We're quite alone. Quite alone. I hope I misjudge your highness. I cannot assume that the future queen of Karlsburg wishes to be treated like the ordinary woman, one in contrast on maneuvers. Oh, then you have encountered other women? What a question? But that's no answer. Very well, I have on many occassions. I find it hard to believe it. Perhaps I can convince you. Well? Typically Karlsburg, well-trained and precise. Your arms are very strong, Karl. But your heart doesn't beat any faster. You are a king first, last and always and you never forget it. You complement me. I don't mean to. Kings bore me. Prussian virtues are impressive, but cold comfort aren't on a long winter's night. Some coffee? No, thank you. You've ruined my sleep as it is. My dear, Ferddie, I am merely giving you an honest opinion. You asked me to find out and I'm telling you. Karl won't do. Just what does she expect? A human being, not a Prussian machine. Karl was raised to be a soldier. he is admired by... by his regiment. Johanna came to get a husband, not to enlist. The world is full of husbands, but there are very few crown princes. I don't know how you raise this girl, but even she should see that Karl is no ordinary fellow. But there are times when even a prince should behave like an ordinary fellow. I know how important this alliance is to you, Ferddie. But you must face facts. You, too, Mathilde, must face facts. Money will not get you what you want. What do you mean? An interesting thing has happened to the royal families of Europe. Every queen you encounter has But there are mighty few royal princes around. There are eight sons in Grabnick. They never bathe. There's Prince Olap. He has ah... buck teeth. Do you want your grandchildren to have backed teeth? Ferddie, that's blackmail! Well, even the king must live. Well, let's not quarrel. We both want this marriage. I'm not blaming Karl. It's your fault. You've taken a perfectly nice boy, and brought him up to be a Prussian pickle. Pickle? He has the best education. Not education, training. You haven't taught him how to get along with people. They'd be no problem with your honor if you'd only get him to radiate a little warmth and charm. Warmth and charm. Professor Juttner, did his majesty sent for you, too? Well, it must be serious. After all, it's the middle of the night. What do you think it's all about, professor? Perhaps they're going to behead me for teaching you to read and write. I was merely obeying orders. I myself am against higher education for the nobility. Well, they can't behead me. I'm the heir apparent. If you knew more history, you'd be more worried. Warmth and charm, that's what you need, warmth and charm. A friendly smile, a cordial hand clasp that's the new order for the day. Why is that important? The princess thinks it's important, that's why it's important. You are a Prussian machine. I saw you with the princess tonight. You dance as if you were storming a fortress. You call that dancing? You're not much better. I wasn't engaged as a dancing master. What were you engaged on? To educate him. He's not educated, he's trained. What have you been doing with your time? Following your orders! Never mind my orders, just do as I tell you. Please, don't blame the boy, your majesty. Each year, more and more time has been stolen from studies and given to marksmanship, military maneuvers, fencing masters. His highness has had no time for the graces of living. From now on, you will study the graces of living. I hold you responsible. Order whatever books you need. Books won't help, sir. No. True education comes from people. I said it before and I say it again. He should have gone to Heidelberg, mix with people of his own age, learn to get along with them. There are hundreds of universities, why Heidelberg? For me, there is only university. I went to Heidelberg, your majesty. Very well, we go to Heidelberg. Make the arrangements. Heidelberg? Who does Johanna think she is? Why should I be made over just to please her? Because there are 8 princes in Grabnick. They never bathe. There's Prince Olap. He has back teeth. I will not listen to these silly arguments. As soon as possible, you'll leave for Heidelberg! And beggining this instant, you will radiate warmth and charm. That's a command. Hubert, this way! No horse play, Lutz. Clear the way. Clear the way, savages. We wish to get to the street. Hubert, help! Help, Hubert! Hubert, the luggages! help! Put me down! Put me down! All through life, we're learning Learning things we ought to know Through and through we're learning Well, I don't know if Lutz will enjoy Heidelberg. But Heidelberg is certainly enjoying Lutz. In my opinion, Herr Doctor, these... I suppose we have to call them students. These students are a little too old for this behavior. Oh, the first day of term, good spirits, the excitement of seeing old friends again. Now, you just give it a chance, and I'm sure you'll find good fellowship very edgy. Like measles. Let's find a carriage. Class of 1874. Willie Klauber! Well, well, what are you doing here? What are you doing in Heidelberg? Didn't they ever let you graduate? Graduate? I'm a full professor. No! Yes! Heaven help the younger generation. When I knew you, you couldn't even spell. Sssh! And what brings you here? Herr Professor klauber, I have the honor to present my pupil... I don't have a pupil and I don't have the honor. Cab! Just a minute! That's my cab! New here? Yes, and let me tell you... Let me tell you! A word of advice. When it comes to cabs, beer and woman, if you want them, grab them and hang on to it. When I want advice, I'll ask for it. Do you know who I am? We're very broad-minded in Heidelberg. We let anybody in. Come on, hop in. Don't stand there like a stick or you'll get left. Smile just once and you can have my sit, and I'll sit on your lap. Prussian pickle! To the inn we're marching For our throats are parching And the fruit trees arching in the month of may For there's no good fellow When he's feeling mellow From the beer so yellow would delay To the inn we're going Where the beer is flowing And we'll soon be blowing off the foam on top And as we're explaining They'll be no refraining Till we're all through draining every drop All in step we're swinging While we join in singing With our voices ringing in a merry rhyme There is joy alounding In our song resounding While our steins are resounding all the time Now the spring we're greeting With our merry meeting And our day completing with a mug of beer To the inn we're heading All our cares we're shedding As we start another college year To the inn we're marching For our throats are parching And the fruit trees arching in the month of may To the inn we're marching For our throats are parching To the inn To the inn We're marching on Beer, here Beer, here Turn the barrel upside down Beer, here Beer, here What a lovely way to get drunk! Savages! Well, you've... you've chosen a mad house for his highness. Doctor Juttner said it was the finest inn in Heidelberg. Juttner would like this place. Does this carousing go on everyday? No, your excellency, only every night. Who is this person? Herr Ruder, the owner of the inn. You tell him he is not to speak until we speak to him. Heae this! Hubert! I will not to occupy a suite where I can hear those cattle-hollering savages. You can hear them everywhere. Your excellency has the same view as the prince's, the river Nekar. The river, yes, I was coming to that. How considerate when you know I suffer from rheumatism. Forgive me, Herr Lutz. The river was here when I arrived. Don't interrupt. I had hoped to come to you and look at you and say "Hubert, I am satisfied. " But I am not satisfied, Hubert. Oh, this might serve for an ordinary lackey. But did his majesty send an ordinary lackey with the prince? No, he sent me. Hubert, who is his excellency? His highness is valet. Valet? Valet, I thought you were a Prime Minister at least. Let me tell you that this inn has been enter taining royalty for over 300 years. Oh, they may have lived here but they were not entertained. Yes, yes, barons, counts and dukes. Never a prince of Karlsburg. it... it had to enter Heidelberg. I warn you, we are not amused by impertinence. Hubert! Lutz! Hubert, where my room is? Where is his highness? Isn't he with you? No, he's with you. He's obviously not with me. Then you've lost the prince. Lost the prince here? I knew you couldn't be trusted. Now, now, don't get excited. He'll get here, and with more dignity than you did. Now, you can laugh but he's my responsibility. Nonsense. I look after him in Heidelberg. Only his mind, I look after his body. This may come as a shock to you, my dear Lutzy. But the mind is more important than the body. Well, you've got to have a body to be a king. That is not my worry. His mind isn't lost, only his body. And if anything happens to it, it will be you who will hang. Kathie! Kathie! Kathie! I hear you call my friends There's beer for all my friends But patience is a virtue Kathie recommends I fear my ears will burst Before I quench your thirst I really should teach you manners But let's tap the barrel first Come, boys, let's all be gay, boys For education should be scientific play, boys Don't dip your pen in ink, boys Let every prudent student study how to drink Bom, bom, bom! Although exams are near, boys Though you may flunk because you're drunk Don't shed a tear Bom, bom, bom! Folks may call you rowdy Your reputations may be cloudy You'll never graduate "Cum Laude" But you'll get a passing mark in drinking beer Come, boys, let's turn to beer, boys And make it clear we're awfully glad that Kathie's here, boys Why waste your time with books, boys Let every prudent student study women's looks Bom, bom, bom! Let old professors state, boys you'll be dismissed Because you've kissed a pretty date Bom, bom, bom! Gladly we will throttle Euripides and Aristotle Then lift another stein or bottle, boys And all together we will celebrate Then lift another stein or bottle, boys And all together celebrate Oh, boys, not now. Who, who? Who is so charming? Who, who do we adore? Who's so sweet and disarming? Kathie, the queen of the corps Yah, yah, yah! Kathie, the queen of the corps Yah, yah, yah! Kathie's the girl we adore Yeah! Boys, I drink to your health. To Kathie! Kathie! Kathie! Kathie! Kathie, Kathie, come, come, come. He's here. He's here. Who's here, uncle? The prince, of course, his highness. Let me look at you. Turn. Oh, take this off, take this off. So here's the bouquet, and the welcome song to sing for you. Go, darling. Oh, uncle, must I? Of course, what's the matter with you? I've never done it before and I'm nervous. Nervous, who isn't nervous? There isn't an inn in all Heidelberg with a real live prince for a tenant! And if he doesn't stay, I shall never live in town. A matter of pride. Besides he is going to take 6 rooms. Your highness, permit me to say... Your highness, it seems the young lady has something to say. Go on, my dear. Welcome highness to Herr Ruder's inn. We hope you'll like our place. There's a room to rest for a royal guest, and a bowl for washing your face. Thank you. Bravo! That was charming. What is your name, young lady? Kathie. Your highness, it is my duty to remind... Excuse me, your excellency. My niece, your highness. This is the landlord, Joseph Ruder. Yeah, that's me, that's me. At your service, your highness. Your rooms are ready. If you will like... to... let... show you... the suite. Permit me, your highness. This is no place for the heir apparent to the throne of Karlsburg. Why, Lutz? The beds are lumpy. The linen is cotton. And as you hear, it's a low drinking place for students who come here to behave like roughings. Nonsense! I know this inn. Well, no palace is here. This is a place for students, not for lackey's and chamberlains. In my opinion, this is perfect. In my opinion, it is impossible. In my opinion, his highness should form his own opinion. Permit me, your highness. And the shelf up here has plenty of room for hats. It's even high enough to put a crown on. I rarely take a crown when I travel. My grandfather prefers I leave it in the vault. And this is the most comfortable bed in inn. For the present, I'll take your word for that. I put two feather beds on. They'll keep you warm on the coldest night. And the springs are good, too. See? I endorse the springs. Now, in the sitting room. If your highness will be good enough to go into the sitting room. Thank you. Every evening, I'll bring up an eiderdown quilt and put it on your bed so that it's nice and warm for you when you go to sleep. You frighten me. It's the first day of may, and you speak as though I shall expect a blizzard. Oh, no, your highness. Why, from now on till autumn, the weather is as mild and fresh, lovely as can be. There! Oh, did you ever smell such air? Go ahead, take a deep breath. The quality seems excellent. Right from your highness' window is the most beautiful view in all of Heidelberg. You can see the river Nekar and way up on the mountain, the castle. I gather that you, Kathie. That is your name, isn't it? That you are most anxious to make sure that I am comfortable in every way. Good. But what happens if some other person less understanding should appear on the scene. My uncle has put me in complete charge. Your highness' slightest wish will be my command. It's a comfort to know that the necessities will taken cared of. However, I hope that Heidelberg will afford some pleasure, too. Do you think it will? The students are a lot of fun. And there are beer parties, and here is the piano. Why so it is. I hope your highness likes music. It's a wonderful way to past time. I look forward to many musical evening in your company. That little song you greeted me with. I recognized the melody, but did you write the words? I know the words were silly, but Uncle Ruder made them up especially for you. And I wouldn't hurt his feelings for anything. The real words are lovely. I know. Why don't you sing them for me? Go ahead. I insist. Very well. When it's summertime in Heidelberg There's beauty everywhere All the tress are dressed in their sunday best And brass band plays in the square Everyday is like a holiday Strolling underneath the sun All the frauleins wear flowers in their hair With a smile to spare for everyone The fragrant breeze The linden trees The promenade where lovers stray But have a care Or someone there May steal your heart away Strange things happen on a summer night When the bells begin to chime It could happen to Someone just like you Down in Heidelberg in summertime Uncle Ruder's words in my voice. No wonder you smiled when I sang to you. Just a moment. You haven't been dismissed yet. In Karlsburg, it is not the custom to walk out on royalty. I beg your highness' pardon. If your highness will excuse me. Before you go, there's just one more thing. Your highness wishes something. Yes, just this. I don't know about the custom in Karlsburg, your highness. But at Ruder's inn, that does not come with the service. History, Lutz. The ancient or modern, your highness. Ancient. Is this the lecture hall for ancient history? Yes. New student, eh? Yes. Registered for this class? What is your name? I am Karl France of Karlsburg. France. Whereas, here you are. Right inside, Herr France. Herr France? Move on, Herr France, you'll be late. Sit down! Don't block the aisle. His excellency, Professor klauber. What's the matter with you, Herr France? Stump your feet like the others. Professor klauber is coming in. Both feet. You're no different from the rest. Welcome to ancient history, gentlemen. It's a new term and ah... we'll start with the new face. It means it will be your face. All history is a record of significant milestones in the development of man. Can you name just one such contribution in the 500 years before the Christian era? Just one, that shouldn't be too difficult. I am aware of many, I was merely trying to select the most important. The conquest of Alexander The Great. Accurate, but not as important as another conquest. While Alexander was beating people over the head, Aristotle was awakening the minds of men. Can the Herr Professor name a figure of greater strength than Alexander. The gorilla. We will discuss Aristotle. Ah, Herr Bauer. Social graces, indeed. Warmth and charm. But it certainly didn't charm me when that officious nobody called me Herr France. They have no manners. That's quite polite in talking to a freshman. But if it bothered you, why didn't you tell him who you were? At first, I didn't have a chance, but then I realized he wasn't the sort of fellow who'd be impressed by it. Ah, you've learned a lot in one day. They're the ones that'll have to learn. If they had any knowledge of tradition, they'd know better than to order me to stump my feet just because a professor comes into the room. It's a matter of respect. Who was the professor? Klauber. Noble prize winner. It's in the finest tradition to honor such a man. He's a full professor. And I am a prince. Position of no academic distinction. My dear, Herr Doctor, you find this very amusing, don't you? My dear, boy. If you'll only relax, you'll find it amusing, too. Listen to them. They are having a wonderful time. If you could only be one of them, a student. Why should I pretend to be nobody when I am somebody? All your philosophy doesn't alter the fact that quality is born in a man. That's very shrewd, your highness. And very true. But in Heidelberg, they either don't know it or they don't care Oh, no, my boy, no. You see, in Karlsburg, the quality is in the title. In Heidelberg, the quality is in the man. Come in. Excuse me, your highness, dinner is ready. Would you prefer it in the privacy of your room? or on the terrace? Where do the ordinary students eat? In this weather, on the terrace. Very well, on the terrace please. Thank you. You take a great deal for granted, Herr Doctor. Oh, no, I'm a slave to orders. His majesty put me in charge here. Well, I'll go to my room and freshen up. Meet you here in a few moments. Don't hurry yourself. I hope I have your permission to go to the terrace. Herr Professor. Good evening, your highness. Would you like your dinner right now? Yes. What would your highness like? What do the ordinary students eat? Kathie! You haven't been dismissed yet. I'm sorry, your highness. I seem to have forgotten again. I'm not so sure you forgot. What's this? Kraut and Frankfurt. It's good, isn't it? Are you still here? You haven't dismissed me. It's good, isn't it? It's ah... not bad. It's very good. I can see you like it, and it won't hurt you to admit it. All right then, I like it. It's even better with beer. I don't think it could be. It is. It's difficult for all new students the first day, and must be even harder for your highness. Do you know once you get used to Heidelberg, you'll find you like a lot of things you never dreamed you'd like. I didn't come to Heidelberg for amusement. What difference does it make if you have fun anyway? It doesn't cost any more. You know, you ought to join a corps. You know, it's more fun than kraut and Frankfurt. If you say so. Now, what corps do you like best? The West Falien. They're all fine friendly boys. Seem to have more fun than any other corps. Then I'll join the West Falien. Oh, no, your highness. They haven't a title among them. You belong with the Sax Blusean. They don't accept commoners. They're all barons, counts, dukes. No princes, but... There aren't enough princes around to make a corps. That presents a problem. I'll need your advice. Sit down, Kathie. I shouldn't, your highness. May I be dismissed? You may not. You have made a great disadvantage, your highness. That's the way I want you to be. Sit down. Now, you said you like the West Falien. Is it because they haven't any titles amongst them? Oh, surely your highness. I have the greatest respect for the nobility. You were all nice young men, but... But what? Well, go on. I insist. It would be most presumptuous of me to... I give you permission to be presumptuous. Well, go on. Well, for one thing. The nobility doesn't seem to be taught manners. Etiquette, yes, but manners, no. They don't ask, they take. I see. Then if I weren't a prince, you'll like me better. I don't know but... At least I'd get a chance to see what you're really like. Try it. Forget that I am a prince. It is not for me to forget that, your highness. All right then, I'm just one of the students, just plain Karl France. We're equals. Just a minute. I didn't say you can go. Well, if we're equals, I can go when I choose. You're not giving me a fair chance, Kathie. I want us to be friends. Treat me as you do the others, will you? Try. It's impossible. After all, you are a prince and I work here. What will people say? Oh, don't worry so much about my reputation. Oh, no, your highness! It's my reputation I'm worried about. Well, Kathie! Is the food here as good as I remember it? Better, Doctor Juttner. I'll set another plate. Thank you. I owe your highness an apology. After all, it's only the first day. I feel I was much too severe. You were quite right, Doctor Juttner. I've just had confirmation of your point of view. Oh, amazing! In 10 minutes, Kathie, you accomplish more than I've been trying to do for 10 years. It wasn't all kraut and Frankfurt, was it, my dear? Hello, Kathie. Ah, I don't remember seeing you here before. New here? My name's Lucas, student officer of the West Falien corps. Now, my dear Kathie, present the gentleman to me. I have the honor to introduce... My name is Herr France. My friend, Doctor Juttner. Doctor Juttner. How do you do? My dear, Herr France, let me welcome you to Heidelberg. Thank you, Herr Lucas. Our friend, Kathie, has just been telling me about your corps Won't you sit down please? And you can tell more about it. Thank you. Well, we're not suppose to boast about our corps. So what I shall say is a gross understatement. It just happens to be the finest corps in Heidelberg. Why, even in the words of our glorious Prospero. The West Falien can drink any other corpsman under the table. Their skill with sword and saber is second to none. That too, Prospero will tell you. I'm sure the Prospero will tell you, he's an old West Falien himself. Oh, then who would know better? Blocking a fox, Lucas? This is becoming a bad habit of his. He lures them away before a gentleman has a chance to look them over. No one that would interest you, count. Count Von Asterburg of the sax blusean. Doctor Juttner. Herr France. I've heard your corps highly praised, Count Von Asterburg. There are many who envy us. You are very fortunate, Herr France. Aside from the Sax Blusean, there isn't a better corps than the West Falien. Oh, don't go yet, count. Why don't you join us? I'll order some beer and you can sit down and tell us about your corps. Perhaps some other time. Oh, now is as good a time as any. We have no vacancies, Herr France. I'm prepared to wait. There are certain requirements, Herr France. A man must stick to his class, a person like you would find himself very uncomfortable in our circle. Good night. He's a decent chap really, but you pressed him hard. I forgive him. Will he forgive you? We'll have no choice. Come! Meet the West Falien. Go on. Silentium! Gentlemen, we have a new recruit and a good one at that. There's only one thing against him. He eats well, drinks well and looks as though he can afford to pay for it. I give you Karl France. Welcome! Richter, cap. Beer! Beer! Beer! Disgraceful! I shall report you for this, Doctor Juttner, mingling with commoners. Why you report me? I'm living like a king. But you permit his highness to contaminate himself with the rabble. When his highness retires tonight, Lutzy. You can burn his clothes and fumigate him. Gentlemen, salamander! Salamander, up! Salamander, up! Salamander, drink! Drink it down in one breath. Drink! Drink! Drink! eins, swei, drei, vier lift your stein and drink your beer Eins, swei, drei, vier Lift your stein and drink your beer Drink! Drink! Drink! To eyes that are bright as stars When they're shining on me Drink! Drink! Drink! To lips that are red and sweet As the fruit on the tree Here's a hope That those bright eyes will shine Lovingly longingly soon into mine May those lips that are red and sweet Tonight with joy my own lips meet Drink! Drink! Let the toast start May young hearts never part Drink! Drink! Drink! Let every true lover salute his sweetheart Drink! Drink! Drink! To arms that are white And warm as a rose in the sun Drink! Drink! Drink! To hearts that will love one Only when I am the one Here's a hope That those soft arms will twine Tenderly, trustingly soon around mine AII I ask is the right to see Those smiling eyes beguiling me Drink! Drink! Let the toast start May young hearts never part Drink! Drink! Drink! Let every true lover salute his sweetheart Let's drink! (Students singing in German) You take the glasses here. Let's go, go, go. Here, let's go. Please, your highness. No, no, not your highness, just Karl. Please, Karl. I took your advice. Surely I deserve a reward. Your highness. Oh, go away, Lutz! I'm sorry, your highness. I shouldn't have done that. It's not your fault. You've just had too much beer. No, no, no, don't blame it on the beer. I prefer to think it's the beer. Well, I prefer you didn't think that. Good night, Kathie. Are we alone? Alone, no, we are together. What's the matter? His highness, Karl France, heir apparent to the throne of Karlsburg, knight commander of the grand order of Frederick The Bold, and so on. has just been assaulted. Where? On the premises. Your niece knocked him down. Maybe he got fresh. Princes do not get fresh. They occasionally make advances. You realize what will come of this, Ruder? He won't get fresh again. You take this very lightly, but I do not. It is my pleasure to inform you that the consequences will be disastrous. Thank you. It would... disastrous? What are you talking about? In Karlsburg, for what your niece dared to do, she would probably be beheaded. Please Herr Lutz, don't make a big point out of nothing. You and I, we are men of the world. I am not! Neither am I. I'm just trying to make a living. But I don't cause you trouble, why must you cause me a trouble? It is not a personal matter. I have sworn to uphold the honor and dignity of the royal house of Karlsburg. In my weekly report to the royal household in Karlsburg, I shall include this unfortunate incident. The report will go to the minister of internal affairs. He will submit it to the prime minister, Von Mark. Von Mark will notify our ambassador in Berlin. It will be presented to the German foreign office. They will submit the matter to his majesty, the Kaiser. The Kaiser will communicate with the chancellor of Heidelberg university. The chancellor will communicate with the burgomaster. The burgomaster will convene the aldermen of the city of Heidelberg. They will summon you, Herr Ruder. What can I do? Dear kind Lutz, my good friend, what do you want me to do? The prince is my responsibility. Your niece is yours. I will warn her. She will never bother his highness again. That is not the solution. His highness may wish to bother her. Get rid of her! My own niece? My sister's daughter? Now don't start snivelling! This is no time for sloppy sentimentality, Ruder. Exile her. Vanish her from this place. Exile her! Vanish her! Exile her! Vanish her! Exile her! Exile her! Vanish her! Exile her! Vanish her! Come in. Kathie. What's the first thing I taught you when you came here? The customer is always right. That's right. No, it's wrong. You mean it wasn't the first thing I taught you? Oh, yes, that's right. But that the customer is always right, that's not right, that's wrong. Right, wrong, wrong, right. This I know. When you got the prince for a customer, you got trouble. Those people are always talking to each other. The prince to the prime minister. the king to the Kaiser. the more they talk, the more trouble I have got. Don't get upset uncle, there won't be any trouble. I knew you would be sensible. Very sensible. I'm leaving in the morning. In the... What? My own niece leaving me? Well, as long as he's here, this is no place for me. I'll get another job. How... how will I look after you? I'm your only family. Don't worry uncle, I'll be all right. I do worry. Maybe if you try to apologize. Why should I apologize? Because you assaulted him. Oh, you know about that. And do you know he tried to get fresh with me? But he's a prince, you can not go around assaulting a prince. That's why I'm leaving. But if you apologize, everything will be all right. What if he gets fresh again? With a nice girl like you, how fresh can he get? Oh, with a fellow like him I'm not going to wait around to find out. I don't like him myself. But if you are stubborn enough to go, to go through the river, work at Groswaltz. Why Groswaltz? Because they are the customers never ask, and the head waiter is my best friend. My darling. Kathie! Kathie! Kathie! Kathie! Stop it! Stop it! Where is Kathie tonight? Don't worry about Kathie. I myself will take care of everything. Turn around! What? Turn around! Step forward a little. That's enough! Sorry, you're no substitute for Kathie. Where is she? The truth, Ruder, the truth! I... sent her away this morning. She misbehaved. Struck one of the customers. Well, if she did, he must have had it coming to him, uh? He certainly did. The young gentlemen want their beer. No beer, Ruder. No beer. We want Kathie! We want Kathie... Where is she? Where is who, your highness? You know who and you know where. Speak up, Ruder. I can't. I can't. My lips are sealed. I promise. It's a matter of honor. You could torture me. Wild horses couldn't drag it out of me. But if your highness is really angry, I wouldn't blame you if you went across the river, to Groswaltz. restaurant near the park. It wouldn't be my fault. I'm just angry enough to do that, Herr Ruder. The river boat leaves every hour. Kathie, I'm terribly sorry. I'm sorry, too. Now... now, go away. One linden soup. I don't blame you for being angry, but it wasn't my fault. I'm not angry. One kraut and Frankfurt. It won't be as good as your uncle's. Then go back there. Not without you. Please stop it. You'll spill the soup. Who is he? I never saw him before in my life. Outside! I don't know how you got in here. But get out the same way. Quiet! Outside! Don't you shout at me! Outside! You'll regret this impertinence! So will you. Outside. Let me go! You'll get me fired. Exactly why I'm here. This maybe a joke to you. It isn't. You're leaving here with me if I have to drag you. Let me go! What's going on here? She refused to take my order. He tried to molest me. Really, do I look like the sort of person who would do that kind of thing? Frankly, yes! I know you students. The wild irresponsible lad. I shall have to ask you to leave. This is a public eating place. I must ask you to leave. And if I don't? Oh, that's the way he always gets when he's been drinking. Obnoxious! Outside or I shall call the police! Go ahead! Call the police! it will look fine in the papers. What will your grandfather say when he reads about it? Outside. Oh, Kathie! Did you hurt yourself? Don't touch me! Everytime you come near me I get in trouble. You clumsy fool! You... you stupid girl! Don't talk to her like that! Shut up! Look at those broken dishes! Is that all you can think about? Suppose she broke her legs? Suppose she cut her face? Who cares about the dishes? I do. Who'll pay for it! If I feel in the mood I may. If you feel in the mood! Who do you think you are? The Kaiser? No, but you're getting warm. Oh, you crazy students are all alike. Big talk and no money. Out or I'll throw you out! Try it! No, no, no fighting. Your grandfather wouldn't like it. Even as a favor to your uncle, this is too much! Oh, I'll pay for the dishes and I'II... No! Turn in your uniform. You're through! I'm awfully sorry that this happened, but just a very unfortunate incident. please excuse, I must apologize. Did he fire you? Thanks to you, he did. Good. Now you'll have to come back. Only for tonight. Tomorrow I'll find another job. Where are you going? The ferry land is down this way. I'm not going on the same boat with you! But I have to get home, too. Do you want me to swim? I don't care if you drown. My grandfather wouldn't like it. Come on! We can have the same argument as we walk along. I have nothing to say to you. Kathie, please say something. Anything. It's a lovely night. I said it's a lovely night. Yeah, lovely night! Please come home, Kathie. The students are all waiting. They swore not to drink any beer unless you're there. They'll change their minds when they get thirsty. But what about me? It was awful this morning. I rang for breakfast. And do you know what happen? Lutz came in with the tray. How dreadful! But you can always pinch Lutz. I could, but it's not as much fun. Kathie, I've never said this before and it's very difficult for me. If I offended you last night, I'm sorry and I apologize. Please come back. It's better if I don't. No, listen. It's allright for you to pretend to be an ordinary student. When things get too involved, you can always become a prince again. But I can't pretend. I can't be anything but just what I am. But nobody wants you to be anything different. Please come back. I'll be on my best behavior. I promise. I don't believe you. You're still angry about last night. Last night when I kissed you, it wasn't the beer. Overhead the moon is beaming White as blossoms on the bough Nothing is heard but the song of a bird Filling all the air with dreaming Could I hear this song forever? Calling to my heart anew My darling While I drift along forever Lost in a dream of you I hear your voice in the wind that stirs the willows I see your face in the stars that shine above Hold me closer Tonight we love The willows bending the stars that shine The shore lights blending they're yours and mine Drifting along in my heart there's a song and the song in my heart will not fade Oh, hear my serenade My moonlight serenade Overhead the moon is beaming White as bloosoms on the bough Nothing is heard but the song of a bird Filling all the air with dreaming Could this beauty last forever? I would ask for nothing more Believe me Let this night but live forever Forever and ever more His highness has never been out so late. If anything happens to him, the king will shoot you. That's naturally! And if I were king, I'll have you hang. Believe me if you were king, I would hang myself. It's the end of you, Ruder, the absolute end. How can you sit there calmly writing? Calmly? I'm writing my will. Ah, your highness, you're back safe and sound. And happy. Uncle Ruder, I brought Kathie home. She's in her room and she's gonna stay. Oh, Lutz, even though you're interference has caused me a most enjoyable evening. In the future, don't interfere! And Ruder, from now on, ignore Lutz. Lutz, I ignore you. Just a minute, Herr Ruder, I warn you. Just a minute, Herr Lutz! I warn you. Make any more trouble and I talk to my niece, Kathie. And Kathie will talk to her friend, his highness. And his highness will talk to the grandfather, to the king. And the king will talk to the Kaiser. And the Kaiser will talk to the other Kaiser. And one Kaiser to the other. And do you know what will happen to you? You will end up pressing pants in a secondary clothing shop. Herr Lutz! I ignore you. Strange things happen on a summer night When the bells begin to chime It could happen to someone just like you Down in Heidelberg in summer time A "crambambuli" is as hot as hades It's got the kind of kick You only get from mules A "crambambuli" is not for the ladies We've heard It's only fit for lunatics and fools. Kathie, what's going on up there? Herr France is giving a little beer party for the West Falien. It's disturbing. Tell Herr France to keep quiet. Uncle, Count Von Asterburg is being disturbed. Tell Herr France to keep quiet. Lutzy, Count Von Asterburg is being disturbed. Tell Herr France to keep quiet. And some red cabbage, Karl. Yes, sir. Please, your highness. Don't stop me now, Lutz! I forgot to order food. Oh, let me your highness, please. All right, then. Sausage and red cabbage for everybody. And hurry. Instantly, your highness. Ruder. Yeah? His highness wants sausage and red cabbage for everybody instantly. You! Come here. What did I hear you say? What song shall we sing For the day that is here None better than Ergo Bibamus There's plenty of reason For making good cheer So out ring's the ditty Bibamus The heavens are blue And the clouds break away Joy enters the door All is blooming and gay And there in our sight all the glory of May We chant with devotion "Bibamus" We chant with devotion "Bibamus" You're the best tenor we've had in 4 semesters. Well... I have an uncle with a Berlin royal opera. When you're ready, maybe I could do something for you. Well, thanks, Richter. That's a good thing to know. What were you planning to do when you get out, Karl? Go in the family business, I suppose. Oh. "Round and round," huh? Round and round and round we go Drinks around the table Lift the flagon, let it flow Long as we are able Count Von Asterburg! Gentlemen! Ah, Count Von Asterburg! Come in, join us. Boys, fill up. To your royal highness! In Heidelberg, I'm a student. Also, crown prince of Karlsburg. Forgive me for failing to recognize your highness. I'm sorry you did. I enjoy being Herr France. I'm sorry I spoiled your little joke, but your highness will have even more fun with the Sax Blusean. You forget Count Von Asterburg, I've already pledged myself to the West Falien. My dear Lucas, surely I don't have to explain to you that his highness' rightful place is with us. If your highness wish to change his mind, we will understand. And give up my friends? Certainly not! I refuse to enter your corps. I'm perfectly satisfied with the West Falien. But it's completely against tradition. Oh, don't take it so seriously, Count. We're all at the same university and the same beer party. Let's enjoy ourselves. Membership in the Sax Blusean, corps is not likely offered, nor has it ever been refused. It's a serious matter to insult an entire corps. Fortunately for your highness, I do not have the privilege of demanding satisfaction. I grant you that privilege. Karl, it's forbidden to duel with a member of reigning house. I'm a student here. I accept your challenge as Herr France. Lucas, Richter, arrange for time and place. It's deep enough. Is the gentleman's honor satisfied? It is. Von Asterburg. Your highness. Is it over? It's a beautiful cut. Straight as an arrow. He's very proud of it. Kathie! Kathie! I'm all right. You didn't have to worry. Who says I'm worried? I not worried. Even if you've been killed... I'm sorry I upset you. I'm not upset. It's a matter of complete indifference to me what happens to you. Nobody's ever been so violently indifferent to me before. It's silly for grown man to try and kill each other for nothing. It's the first time anyone has ever cried over me. Deep in my heart, dear I have a dream of you Fashioned of starlight Fragrant with roses and dew Our paths may sever But I'll remember forever Deep in my heart, dear I'll always dream of you I've waited a lifetime for someone to say The things you are saying to me And, darling I mean every word that I say Just look in my eyes and you'll see You smile and my tears have all melted away My worries were all false alarms It looks like the start of a beautiful day Just holding you here in my arms With you everyday's a beautiful day As long as I'm here in your arms Deep in my heart, dear I have a dream of you Fashioned of starlight Fragrant with roses and dew Our paths may sever But I'll remember forever Deep in my heart, dear I'll always dream of you (masked ball) Oh, let's go on like this for the rest of our lives forever, ever and ever! Oh, it would be wonderful, Karl, forever and ever and ever! Oh, why not? Kathie, come away with me. I've always wanted to see the world. Do you think it's really round? Kathie, I mean it. Come away with me. Princes don't disappear. What would we do? Where would we go? It doesn't matter. Everywhere! Anywhere! We'd be together. Just the two of us, Kathie, together. Together. But it's impossible. But why don't we try it? We can change at the inn. No one is there. The night train out of Heidelberg, to Paris in the morning. They'll never find us. Oh, Kathie, I love you. There's nothing else that matters. Oh, I adore you. Come on! Kathie, hurry, before anyone comes back. Hurry, Kathie, hurry! Karl. Kathie, what's the matter? I can't go, Karl. Not to Paris, not any place. But Kathie, a minute ago... The carnival is over. Not the same anymore. This is my uncle's inn. I'm Kathie Ruder. I work here. And you're his highness, Karl France. The world is not big enough for us to run away from that, Karl. They'd never let us alone in a week or a month... But even a week is better than nothing, a day, an hour. They couldn't take that away from us. We'll have it for the rest of our lives. No, Karl. No! Tonight was just a masquerade Tomorrow just another day Let come whatever Tonight or never I'll throw the mask away Beloved! With all my heart, I love you With every breath I pray Someday you will be mine Summer or spring winter or fall You are my life my love, my all Beloved! The very stars above you Are jealous of the way Your eyes sparkle and shine Day after day Near or apart I try to say Be still, my trembling heart But try though I may I cannot hide this passion inside That won't be denied If this be madness Then call it madness I only know I'll never rest till you are mine Beloved! Believe me when I tell you From now until the last bright star fades from the blue Now and forever Whatever I do Beloved, I love you Oh, Karl! Kathie! We must hurry. I'm ready. Your highness. Forgive the intrusion, your highness. I have urgent instructions from his majesty. Urgent? His majesty is ill. He wishes to see you. How long has he been ill, Von Mark. How serious is it? His majesty is an old man. At his age, no illness is to be taken lightly. We can discuss it as we go. Karl, it's the most... I beg your pardon. Kathie, I have to go back to Karlsburg. But it's only for a little while. The prime minister has just come for me. My grandfather is ill. He's a husky old man. He'll live forever. I'll be back. Of course. I promise you I'll be back. I know you will, Karl. It would have been a beautiful day. There'll be many other days, Kathie. And each day more beautiful than the last. I'll be back. You'll never come back. His highness, Karl France. Here. Here. All right. All right. Tell him to come in. Your majesty. Your highness. Welcome home, Karl. Let me have a good look at you. Heidelberg obviously agrees with you. You're looking well. What's more important is that you look well. Von Mark was so depressing that... You expected to find... a doggerel old wreck wasting away in bed, did you? Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Von Mark is an alarmist. I'm considerably better as you can see, and after a few weeks in Switzerland, I will be quite myself again. I'm so happy, grandfather. For your sake as well as for mine. As you say, Heidelberg agrees with me, and... I'm extremely anxious to get back. You are not going back. This illness has made it quite clear to me that even I cannot go on forever. And it is not my intention to leave with important business unfinished. I have been in communication with the queen. Your marriage will take place very shortly. But grandfather... Formal papers are being drawn up The details have been arranged. Except for one detail. I am not in love with the princess. It is of no importance. It's of the utmost importance to me. That little bar maid, isn't it? How do you know about Kathie? It's my business to know, my boy. I am not criticizing, but surely you can't take this seriously. It is serious. I'm in love with Kathie. Bar maids are as plentiful as gooseberries. There'll be plenty of other young ladies. Not for me. Then the princess will find you an unusually faithful husband. And if I don't wish to marry? This marriage is a state affair. I have never permitted personal feelings to interfere with duty. I demand the same conduct from you. All my life I've been told what to do, and I've done it. But not anymore. I've had a taste of freedom. Freedom is a luxury that no king can afford. Then I don't want to be king. What else do you think you might be? A man. To run away from your duty, your training, your obligation, will hardly make a man of you. If you're not a king, you are nothing. Least of all, a man. But grandfather... I am not talking as your grandfather, but as your king. The discussion is over, your highness. Your majesty. Eins, Swei, Drei, Vier Lift your stein and drink your beer Eins, Swei, Drei, Vier Lift your stein and drink your beer Drink! Drink! Drink! To eyes that are bright as stars When they're shining on me Drink! Drink! Drink! To lips that are red and sweet As the fruit on the tree Here's a hope That those bright eyes will shine Lovingly, longingly soon into mine May those lips that are red and sweet Tonight with joy my own lips meet Drink! Drink! Drink! Let the toast start May young hearts never part Drink! Drink! Drink! Let every true lover salute his sweetheart Let's drink! How is his majesty? Splendid. He told me so himself. This was all a trick. We're going back to Heidelberg. Lutz, get the luggage. It was extremely clever of you, Von Mark, to get me here by telling me his majesty was ill. I'm going back to Heidelberg. You may tell his majesty that. Please your highness, his majesty is much too ill to be upset. If he were really ill, I would not leave him. He's going on a trip to Switzerland. Not Switzerland nor any place else. The doctors will tell you that his majesty is a great deal sicker than either you or he realizes. How can I believe you, Von Mark? Your highness suspects me of trickery. Your highness is quite right. But I'm deceiving your grandfather, not you. I have served my king too long to have the heart to tell him what the doctors say. It is matter of a few days, an hour, any moment. I'll walk with God from this day on His helping hand I'll lean upon This is my prayer my humble plea May the Lord be ever with me There is no death Though eyes grow dim There is no fear When I'm near to him I'll lean on him forever And he'll forsake me never He will not fail me As long as my faith is strong Whatever road I may walk along I'll walk with God I'll take his hand I'll talk with God He'll understand I'll pray to him Each day to him And he'll hear the words That I say His hand will guide my throne and rod And I'll never walk alone While I walk with God Well, Lutz, I suppose everything is ready. Your majesty's luggage is already aboard the royal train. Good. The people of Karlsburg are waiting eagerly to welcome Princess Johanna as your bride. This marriage is a very happy event. Is it, Lutz? For they've been waiting 2 years for it. I wish your Majesty every happiness. Let's drink to that. It's all right, Lutz, relax. Is that a command, your majesty? Not at all, but I wish you would. Your wish is my command. This is my bachelor party, Lutz. At a time like this, a man needs a friend. We are friends, aren't we? I hope not, your majesty. Would the idea upset you, Lutz? Indeed it does, your majesty. It is an honor to put on a king's shoes. But I certainly wouldn't do it for a friend. If I must treat your majesty as an equal, then Hubert would treat me as an equal. And I assure you, your majesty Hubert is not my equal. Forgive me, Lutz. I shall endeavor to behave a manner more suitable to the dignity of our relationship. I'm sorry to interrupt, your majesty. Please forgive me, but this... this is impossible. I'm much too old and fat to start wearing uniforms. Oh, I must resign as privy counsellor. My dear doctor, if you weren't a privy counsellor, you couldn't be in the official party. If you weren't in the official party, you couldn't come to North Hausen. And if you weren't at North Hausen, you couldn't be at the wedding. And then I couldn't have you as my best man. I'm afraid I must refuse your resignation. Ah, what I go through for friendship. Besides you can't leave me alone with Lutz. Why not? He doesn't approve of me. No? Ever since Heidelberg. We thought of everything, except that one day I'd have to come back. And that I'd be changed. But that Karlsburg wouldn't be. Perhaps after all, Heidelberg was a mistake. I don't regret a minute of it. No, thank you, Lutz. One moment. As a privy counsellor, I'm not permitted to drink unless your majesty does. But if I can wear this uniform for you, surely you can drink a small brandy for my sake. Silentium! Silentium! A salamander for the privy counsellor. Long life. And pleasant memories. And pleasant memories. To Heidelberg. Heidelberg! Golden days in the sunshine of our happy youth Golden days Full of gaiety and full of truth In our hearts We remember them all else above Golden days Days of youth and love How we laugh With a joy that only love can bring Looking back through memory's haze We will know life has nothing sweeter than it's springtime Golden days when we're young Golden days Well, good night, my boy. See you in the morning. In the morning at North Hausen. Good night, Herr Doctor. Good night. It would have been a beautiful day. There'll be other days, Kathie. And each day more beautiful than the last. I'll be back. Your majesty. Lutz, you will have the train stop at Heidelberg. Me? But your majesty, it's not on our schedule. It is now, Lutz. It is now. Drink! Drink! Drink! To eyes that are bright as stars When they're shining on me Drink! Drink! Drink! To lips that are red and sweet As the fruit on the tree Here's a hope That those bright eyes will shine Lovingly, longingly soon into mine May those lips that are red and sweet Tonight with joy my own lips meet Drink! Drink! Drink! Let the toast start May young hearts never part Kathie. Karl. What are you doing here? I'm on my way to North Hausen. I'm gonna be married. Yes, I know. It was in the papers. It's the way it should be. I never thought I'd see you again. I told you I'd come back. Yes, you did. That was when you were a student here. We lived in the same world. It's all the world I ever wanted. And we nearly got away. Remember the night of the carnival? Yes, I remember. Oh, it's was a wonderful dream. Now it's over. Everything is different. Nothing has really changed, nothing except you and me. You're a king now. I still love you, Kathie. I always will. And you? No matter what ever happens, that will never change. My only love. Your first love. Goodbye, Kathie. Goodbye, your majesty. Gaudeamus! Let us rejoice while we are young. END
