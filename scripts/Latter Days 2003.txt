I'm straight. That is so how all guys say that No, I'm serious, dude. Oh really? It's too bad. 'Cos I'm amazing. I don't like to brag, but I can suck the engine block to the tail pipe of the '58 Chevy. Really? Yeah, talking 'bout the big ones with the 380s. Oh. So you know cars, yeah? And beer. See, unlike with women, you can crack one open right after.. Hell! You can have one during. It'll just be a little fun between buddies, you know. And you'll never have to call me. Till you're up for another round, that is. You're not worried about Elizabeth coming in? Elizabeth? My roommate is Julie. I'm here for a date with Elizabeth. Elizabeth is 243D, as in 'down the walk'. This is 243B. As in 'Blowjob'. You're not StraightCurious from AOL? No. Not again. Oh, shut up! You're so lying to me. A-a! Check the journal! Look. September 20th. Oh my God! That is so funny! So maybe you should write a song about that. I can't believe you've almost done with your demo and you haven't written a song about your best friend. Yeah, I can't believe that the tree falls in the forest it wouldn't have something to do with you. Hey, J. Martinis, vodka or gin? Gin, and you, you can tell that friend of yours to go fuck himself. You know, I only have one friend who can actually do that, and I doubt you've met. I mean the base player. We were just supposed to lay down some tracks but the second song it was like my bra had grown hands. Excuse me, wannabees, order up. One callback, she's Margo Channing Second callback, thank you. Second lead in the feature. I'm so getting this. Soon, I can kiss you losers goodbye and finally justify moving to this miserable fucking town. You ever read for Barry Wolf? Hey, why are we skipping on the fries? Come on, load me up. Barry Wolf read me once for this commercial, he was licking me with his eye the whole time. They don't call him the 'Wolf who cried Boy' for nothing. You know, he wouldn't even see me for that crappy TV 'Wacky Gay Neighbour' thing? What's that about? I'm gay, I'm wacky Maybe you're not neighbourly. Fuck you. I'm Donna Reed on a stick Excuse me, darlings. I hate to interrupt this important discussion between all you big stars... I'll settle for medium star. Point well taken. In the meantime, I hear that Disney's opening a Fantasia restaurant where the plates fly themselves to the tables. Until then, what to do. Hot stuff, coming through. Yes! Hi guys. You take one of my tracks and give the karaoke at Funny Boys. Julie! Also two-for-one margaritas? I'll be there. Enjoy your meal. Quit gawking, we don't have all day. Au, fuck. Yeah, fuck you too. Mum? Julie. Where the hell are you? I'm here. Isn't this where you called me, where did we end up last night? I don't know, but I woke up without my bra. That's never a good sign. I wouldn't worry about it. So, why are you calling me and not just tiptoeing across the hall with sympathy and Excedrin? I tried that, I thought you'd gone. Spin class is starting. Oh fuck. Hey, hold up a minute. We've met. Um, no, I'm brand new here. Hey, Green, let's get it moving along huh. Gotta go. All unpacked...final bell, Harmon is down. Hey Gilford why don't you come over here and give me a back rub? Wrong tree. Barking. Think I'm rubbing your pimply back, you homo. David? Come on, Green, help a guy, allright? Have stuff to put away. Come on, Gil, just like ten minutes. You know I'd give you one. You're on. No, I asked you first. Nope. That hurts! Prepare to die, dude. Hey. Hi! You remember me, from across the way? Yeah. Harmon! I brought you guys a 'Welcome to the complex' sixer. Uh, thanks, but we don't drink. What kind of frat boys are you? Who called up Deliver-A-Fag? Geez, Ryder a little louder and he'll probably hear you. I don't care You see those flippin' shorts he was wearing? Just check that. OK, three of these There was the most adorable man, Daniel, here this evening. I thought I might introduce you. Really? Blue shirt, end of the bar? Actually yes. Daniel. We've met. August, 3rd... yup. Oh, not so good, not so good. Andrew, can I have a glass of that Merlot there? Sure thing. And Ben called for you, Miss M. Well, I suppose if he calls this late in the week, I can call him this late in the evening, right? -Absolutely. -Cheers. Oh oh, you guys wanna hear something freaky? Remember those four people that moved into Elizabeth's old apartment? Guess what they do. Quadruplet porn stars. This town? Hardly freaky. They're rodeo clowns. No, listen, it's even weirder than that. They are Mormon missionaries, swear to God. Oh. Although rodeo clowns would've been kinda cool. They must've loved your aberrant lifestyle. I dated a Mormon guy once. His family put him through shock therapy. We have sex, he was a wild man. Then he wanna throw himself out the window. So, you live on the first floor. Yes, but it's hell on my azaleas Now, wouldn't it be funny if you converted them instead of them converting you? Could you imagine? No, I've seen these boys, they're wound way too tight for that. I bet he can't do it. Oh, wait. Are we betting here? Same as always, five and a sixer? Oh no, this is big. We're going high stakes? 50 says he can't. I've seen the guys on the bikes. I'm thinking, this time you have met your match. Really? -Bullshit. 50 says he can. And I bust tables for a week. OK, I'm in with Andrew, no way. Oh, cool. We on? So what are we talking about here? I get him to what? Do anything? Blowjob? We need proof. OK, underwear. I knew this other Mormon guy in the army. They got these sacred boxers they shimmer. Get one of those. Sacred undies? I gotta see this. All right, I'm in. I will get one of those boys out of their underwear Seal the deal. Alright, we're going out tonight? Oh please, not another episode of 'Christian hooks up'. Hey, gotta keep my skills honed. To skills. Hey, leaving? Yeah, yoga. You? Mmm, arm day... Hey, I don't think we've met. I'm Julie Taylor. Hi. I'm Elder Davis. What you reading there? I'm just studying. You know, I thought I'd come outside. 'Cos, we're from Idaho, it gets cold in October. Oh, wow, bummer. It's pretty much like this all the time here. Isn't it, Chris? Yeah. So, what is it that you guys do? We talk to people about our church. Oh really? Chris likes to talk to people. Sometimes it helps people to find meaning in their lives. Julie was complaining her life is void of meaning. Void? I said 'void'? Well, maybe we can come talk to you. You know, we would like that. Sure. OK. Bye. Subtle... Yeah, I got 50 right on you. See you at work. Thank God she's leaving. Can you believe 'Entertainment Weekly' called her the new sweetheart of American cinema? That cunt? She made Julie take my table, because she thought I hadn't bathed recently. Like she should talk. Did you see her eat? Yeah, did you check out her legs? Now I know why they call them calves. I bet after sex, she smokes a ham Darling, give me a glass of Cuvet I do hope we're not speaking disparagingly about our clientele Gossip is so ignoble. Especially regarding those less fortunate. Less fortunate? That bitch?! You know something... tell. No, I would never tell tales, such as with the frequency she does it the poor child must think that binging and purging are aerobic excercise. She hardly looks bulimic. Yes, if I were a different sort, I'd suggest a little more of the purging, a little less of the binging. But I would never say such things. For gossip is the lowest form of discourse. You should avoid it if at all possible. Hear, hear. I shall be in the office, cooking the books, if anybody needs me. Oh, and Ben called. He seemed kind of insistent. Do you suppose Lila is hiding a boyfriend from us? Fucking skank... that's not a tip, that's an indictment. Take it sound, J. Christ, who pissed in your Cheerios? Some A and R guy. She has drinks with this guy so he'll listen to her demo and now she fears for her virtue. Hey! He's totally cute. I bust my ass making a great demo, I can't get anyone to listen to it till this guy who so obviously just wanted to fuck me. Poor baby. I thought he was cute. What, you would have sex to help your career? Honey, I'd blown a guy just to get him out of my apartment. Sex for my career would be noble. Ben, I'm not ready to make that kind of decision yet. I have to go. OK, I'll call. Here's Andrew's wine order. Thank you. Is there something else? Everyone thinks Ben is your boyfriend, but he's not, he's a doctor, isn't he? Is everything OK? Young man, I will not be the subject of gossip in my own establishment. Sorry. And that's how, through Joseph Smith, God restored the true church of Jesus Christ to the earth. Have any questions? How come if God talks to Joseph Smith, he's a prophet but if God talks to me, I'm schizophrenic? Ah, well, he was sort of special. What's the Mormon church's stand on black people? That's a good question. African American members have been allowed to hold the priesthood since 1978. Since disco. And women? Women don't get to hold the priesthood, what they get is to be wives and to be mothers and share in its blessings. Oh, sharing. See, sharing is good. Christian here was wondering what is your church's stand on gay rights. Um well... There's no such thing. 'Gay' and 'right' don't belong in the same sentence. Oh, but 'right' and 'rightwing' go hand-in-hand? Yeah, God hates homos. You're gonna come into my house and tell me God hates homosexuals? And the French! God hates the French? Everybody hates the French. Just push the orange button. Oh, you are such a sweetheart for doing that, thank you. You're welcome. Ma, you're flashing the whole terminal. I can't help it. If I don't they are gonna end up around my knees. Oh, I'm losing the only other sane one around here. I think this belong to you now, son. Do us proud. Yes sir, I will. You know, you have yourself a real safe trip, OK? Oh, for crying out loud, I wasn't gonna do this. Ma, you promised. If you start, I will. I know, but I can't help it, because you're my baby, you know. And you always will be. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Look, if there's a problem, I could come back. Look, maybe I'm just homesick. Homesick? For Idaho? Okay, fine.. I'm sorry. That came out wrong. It's just.. When I left home... I zoomed like a rocket here. But if you've never been away from home before.. Have you? What? I've been away from home. Just, not for two whole years. Could be worse, could be raining. That's 'Young Frankenstein'. Yeah. So two years, huh? Yeah. We're not allowed to call or go home in the holidays, and they're not allowed to visit. Wow, where do I sign up? Hey, I happen to like my family. After all, a boy's best friend is his mother. 'Psycho'! That's 'Psycho', right? She goes a bit mad sometimes.. We all go a bit mad sometimes. At least you got your friends here, right? What, Ryder? No, we just got assigned to each other a few weeks ago. Oh. Well, better you than me. Kind of a funny coincidence, all you guys being named Elmer, huh? -Elmer?! You think I'm an Elmer? -Well, you're not? No, doofus! It's Elder. It's a title. Elder.. Oh, that's a good thing. Somebody naming you Elmer, it's just mean. What's your first name, then? We're not allowed to use them. What? Why not? We're not allowed to do a lot of things. It's Aaron. Aaron. I like that. You're gonna sort through those, right? Colours and whites don't mix, Aaron. OK, thanks. Oh wait, you've never done your laundry before either, have you? Well, maybe I've just never done everybody's. That's what I have to do, 'cos I'm a greeny. The new guy, you know. So I have to do everyone's laundry, in accordance with prophecy. Really? Psyche'! Dude, you're way too easy. That's what I've heard. Well, thanks for the laundry tips. Geez, Elder. You're a thousand miles away over here How you doing, Green? Good. Yeah, you sure? Yeah. You know, when I was a Green, it was really tough. I used to pray that I would die during the night so I wouldn't have to wake up to another day of this. You're joking me, right? I couldn't take going back to the family, you know, Salt Lake and all. I had two of the general authorities at my missionary farewell. You know what's that like, your dad is a state president, right? They set this thing up to be difficult, OK? We can't listen to music, we can't watch movies, we're never supposed to be alone. I mean, what, we're 19, 20 years old, and we're not even allowed to beat off. Some nights I wake up and I find teeth marks on my head board. Look, I put my time in here so that I can go home, so I could marry Jennifer, so that I can finally nail her. See? It's amazing what we'll do for sex. I know you did! I did not, I promise you. Yes you did! I cross my heart. Oh, that means something. Hey, we'd like to play here. Yeah, we're playing here. You're just farting around. How vivid. We're playing, see? Bounce the ball, bounce the ball. No, you're just jerking us around. There's one afternoon a week where I can just be normal and play some hoop, and you have to come and get all ignorant about it? Oh, listen to that, Julie. I didn't think Mormons liked whine? I didn't know fairies liked sports. Fairies? Oh, how seventh grade. Why don't we just play two on two? But you're.. A girl, so I can't play? But then I am black, so maybe I can. Your only problem is deciding which one of your narrow-minded stereotypes can kick your lilly white ass. Which one will it be? Black girl... and a fag? We'll mop you like a dirty floor. Fine. We're shirts, you're skins. Uh... no... Fine, we'll be skins. That's unfair put your shirts back on we can keep the teams straight You can play. Yeah, we can learn a skill. I played in highschool, when I learned all the jocks were doing it but only with other jocks. Maybe we should cut the chatter. OK slackers, how's the studying coming? Ryder? Right. All right, First Corinthians 7,1. Ryder? Right. Anybody? Gil. And therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. Well, all right Green! You know, if Gilford wouldn't be completely heartbroken, you would be my new best friend. Yeah, Harmon, I got your heartbreak right here. Oh, man! Elder, you got the devil in you! Hey. Oh, shit. Jesus Christ! Sorry, I stabbed myself. Looks like you're bleeding. You okay? No, I'm fine. Just go back to your reading. What? I think you.. fainted. I don't bleed very well. I'm OK, really. No, maybe we should get you inside. Ryder! Wanna give me a hand? Damn Ryder I'm gonna hit you and it's gonna hurt. That hurt! I warned you. All right. No, Aaron, come on. Do me a favor you've got to take a look at it... tell me if I stiches or something. I can't really tell. All right, look! Come on I'm not going to lunge at you just take a look at it. Let's see here.. Is it bad? No, it's fine, it's just a little cut. Do you have any disinfectant? Yeah. It's funny, you know. I'm not squeamish. In high school, we went to this hospital, but I was the only one who wanted to watch surgery. They brought me in and they.. scrubbed me down, and they put me in these green things, you know? You have Band-Aid? I watched as they opened this guy's chest and there it was, this heart, this human heart. You think about it beating and all but it's it's more of a dance. And I couldn't get over it that's all That tethers us to this planet you know that... ...fragile little muscle and it's tiny you know, in the scheme of things... if you think about all the things that can stop it there's got to be something else some miraculous thing that keeps that valiant little muscle dancing you know what I mean? I'm sorry... I'm gonna stop talking I have to lay down now. It's hot I'm hot Maybe I should get you a cool cloth I haven't done anything... ...anything like this... happened... It's OK...this doesn't have to mean anything Yes it does It can be just a little fun... between friends My first time could just be a little fun for you? Maybe you can equate sex with a handshake That's what... like a badge?! What do you want me to congratulate you? Hey... don't preach to me, OK? I know you are some kid from the sticks You come in here an fucking judge me? Yeah... I am some dudah pudnacker from Pocatello... they ship us here from dork island I'm saying I know how retarded you think I am OK You found me out, alright? My worst secret Now I'm humiliated so your work is done here Wait... I don't think you are a dork but if you know how ridiculous you look, why would you do it? Don't you believe in anything? Yeah... Then tell me... Tell me one thing in your life beyond a shadow of a doubt that you really believe I believe Ann Margret has never been given her due as a night actress Duh! For Tommy alone, I mean, did you see her when she was... Is that something you can build a life on! Look at yourself! You're so pretty and colorful on the outside... ...but on the insde you're nothing but fluff You're like a walking... talking... marshmallow peep That's not fair It doesn't matter when it's true I can't believe what I was about to do When there is nothing Christian, nothing about you that's not skin deep Do you believe in God? What, who are you talking to? You. No, everybody...alright, general question: Do you believe in God? You mean other than Madonna? Fucking A yeah, I do... why not? I believe in harmony as a law in the universe like gravity you know we're meant to vibrate together Well being positive since I was 17 gives meaning to the word Miracle so yeah I mean without getting all holy on your ass I believe...what? The mormones are mindfucking him Oh honey you do not want to let them get into your psyche You start off listening to Amy Grant but then before you know it... ...it's 3 am and you got your Visa card and you're giving it to the scary bitch on tv with the lavender hair Hello Chris we have a bet going here.

I'm not very good at this See I've never made a fool out of myself in front of anyone before But I've never felt this way before about anyone in my entire life What for just some guy you can't have And then next week you're get to be on to your next conquest But what if you're not Huh? What if everything in my entire pathetic life which I happen to love has led me to this point, right now What if you are the blinding light in the middle of the road that strikes me like the guy in... ...the in the Bible him! Paul? Yeah! And what if everything's changed like that... And lions lay down with lambs and colours mix with whites... What if you're the one I have been waiting for my whole life and I let you go You have no idea what I'd be giving up Damnit... what's wrong with you You want revelations engraved in gold and angels trumpeting down from heaven what if this is it in stead Me telling you I love you, right here.. in the snow I think that is pretty miraculous But if you don't... I'll go you can pretend this was just some coincidence you can pretend there wasn't some reason we met That you're sorry I ever walked into your life God I hate the snow Ho... door must have froze shut you boys come in before you freeze too My we're closing the whole airport because of this storm How long did we go at it Two and a half hours It's OK right? OK? That's amazing I don't know how long you're supposed to do it You carry a pocket watch! Just some months It was actually my great grandfathers but... ... I don't think you came here for a geneology lesson You know, I thought you'd be a little more reticent Well... I'm already going to hell for kissing you so.. I may as well take the scenic route What God do you believe in It's not just God... ...it's everything this... you... tonight I'm just... turning my back on it all But you know I guess... a guy like you really doesn't know what that's like you know.. to be completely cut off When I was 13 years old my dad... ...he was this macho hot shot banker guy and I was just this skinny little kid... who'd been caught trying on his mother's shoes one too many times anyway, my dad said he would rather die than raise a little nellyboy and I thought I would rather die than be one So my dad, who'd never been out of the city in his entire life decided we're going to go hunt deer so my dad drags me to this lodge up in the Sierras right... it's early November the same as now and there is this storm rolling in my dad was so determined that sissy boy was going to kill something snow came at us from all sides the air, the sky, the ground they all became the same and horrible screaming...white and I thought we're gonna be OK, right and then I saw my father's eyes and they were that same white... and that's when he did it And do what? Ran He didn't come back for you Uh uh But I got calm... I knew I was going to die and that's when I heard it an angel singing An angel? Turned out not to be an angel at all What was it Just the wind... over some rocks A cave Inside at least I was out of the snow and I guess I drifted off when I woke up it was dark it was still snowing hard and I heard a noise at the mouth of the cave like a bear and it grabbed me and it picked me up and I fought but I was so weak and cold... all I could do was knock the bear's hood off Bear had a hood? Turned out to be a bear only in the sense of the search and rescue guy was pretty hairy That's when it got weird And not until then? He ripped off all my clothes and he tore all his clothes off Sure you weren't delirious? Then he stuffed us into a sleeping bag Oh wait... hypothermia... I remember from the boyscout manual Exactly but I didn't know what to think I was so... tired and cold despite of it all.. I popped the biggest woody ever And he wrapped those big arms around me pulled me into that hairy chest and told me I was OK That was the first moment in that whole ordeal I began to cry I don't blame you I would have been freaked out too No... it was joy I thought I'd rather die than be gay I got a pretty good idea what dying felt like But lying there in the arms of that man I thought if this is what being gay feels like Bring it on Come on... let's get you home Hello? Oh that's very funny Fuck you Andrew Boy... where have you been Salt Lake OK if you haunt your guys all that way you had better tell me you won the bet I think I'm the loser on this one... Hey hey hey..don't let it get to you... even Tiger Woods slices now and then Fucking Andrew! Is he doing his crackhead telemarketer again? No he is jerking me around by... on the offchance just... you didn't happen to give my demo out to anyone, did you? Um.. yeah.. this Angel Food guy delivered to him and he said he was once in the music business but.. you know I thought he might like it I think he gave it away To? Oh Julie oh no I mean he's on heavy medicine he's loopy anyway you can't take what he says seriously... Julie you are hurting my arm Who did he give it to? He said he was gonna give it to Clive... Davis?? Clive Davis? Oh fuck me I hung up on Clive Davis? Oh my God answer it No you answer it.. Answer it! Au Julie that's the arm that I... Fucking answer it! Hello? Julie Taylor? Um... so is that Clive with a D of Clive with a V Oh well.. it's official... winter's here Bundle up Ah... much better So... guess what...this A and R guy from the record company has been totally coy about which team he plays on.. when I introduce you, you can totally nail him and set the record straight well... so to speak I go pass on this one... You know... why? he is totally cute, I'm serious What's wrong with you... you know, you haven't been yourself since... wait... are you still not over missionary man? I don't know Chris It's weird with him disappearing like that OK... wel then stop moping like a schoolgirl and do something about it, call him... Just dial 1-800-TORTURED MORMON? Probably sounds they've got enough of them But I think you should just get the hell over it Maybe I don't want to I mean LA is a city where everyone dances with one eye on the door... like we're all waiting for something better to walk in Who would even recognize it if it did? It would be nice to stop circling It would be nice to stop equating sex with a handshake And it would be nice to have it mean something Listen to you, you are turning into a chick Shut up! You are! Wait Christian wait, seriously you dropped something What? Your balls! Must have fallen over under somewhere This is me not talking to you OK wait but you're still coming to the show tonight, right? As president of the Pocatello stake it is my unhappy duty and obligation to convene this church court on behalf of the Elder Aaron Davis for grave and grievous sin of homosexuality In the light of your abnormal and abonimable state and your refusal to see you have been duped into a hogwash alternative lifestyle.. I wish my shame was enough for both of us not to mention the shame you brought to this church.. a family... our ancestors... Wait a minute our ancestors? Dad...your grandfather had half a dozen wifes Same goes for every single person in this room... I'd say we were the original definition of alternative lifestyle Are you calling us hypocrites? No we've gone way beyond hypocracy Dad, now we're just being mean With the authority invested in me by the Melchizedek priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ I have no choice but to begin excommunication proceedings against you at witch point you will be stripped of the priesthood... the garments... and membership in this church Still at it? There are a lot of Davises up there Hi, I'm trying to reach an Aaron Davis No not Errol.. AARON...two A's... Hi, I'm looking for Aaron Davis... No, he didn't win anything... No no no, he is younger than that... Does he have a son named Aaron? No! Yeah! Let me talk to your wife Hi, hello I'm looking for an Aaron Davis What? The Davis Boy, yeah that sounds like him No, he's not in anymore trouble... What kind of trouble? I'm sorry... I'm not trying to pry Ferron Davis can you spell that? On Stone Creek... really...Thank you so much Buck Owens... really... they still run that? OK, well you get back to it now OK, thank you Hello? I'm sorry, brother Davis is down at the Stake Center Oh, I'm sorry... Aaron? May I ask why you are trying to reach Aaron? Los Ang... are you one of the Elders in Los Angeles? No...you know what, my son has no desire to speak to you and I hope you could have the decency not to call here again Is Dad missing dinner again? Oh it's nothing but he sure is late over at the Stake Center... there is no point in this getting cold If you are just gonna play with it... I don't know why I bother anymore Julie! get out here... I found him You talked to him? No, his mother hung up on me Um... bitch! No, but if he really did not want to talk to me then she really would not have had a problem putting him on the phone, right? And next time he will probably pick up Damn girl I didn't know getting hung up on makes me feel so good Good! Then we're going out because you have been a contrary mary way too long Did something fall again? Yeah, just a little dropsy... you go on Mum? Mum... What Aaron What? It's nothing I just wanted to see if you bring yourself to look at me I'm looking at you... what am I suppose to be seeing Nothing His name was Christian, wasn't it What? Is Christian the one? What did he do to you! He loved me Don't say that! Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? How repulsive that is to God to everyone? Two men? Men don't love Aary... women bring love to a relationship. But Ma he told me he loved me... He would have told you anything He flattered and beguiled you... tools of the devil that's what they do You don't know that Yes I do You don't know that I do... you know why? Because when you didn't arrive home... I called your mission president You checked up on me huh? I was worried sick about you.. and you know what he said? Your missionary companion told him that that Christian person... you were nothing more than a bet he made That's not true... Yes it is true.. he won your soul for a lousy 50 dollars That's all you were worth to him and you know what? He's probably forgotten all about you and now he's moving on to his next fornication Mum he wouldn't.. It meant nothing to him, he was using you and that is why... you can never think about him again, ever... ever again You got... you have got to put this thing behind you this horrible mistake that everybody knows about... You've seen how they look at us You've seen how people just turn their carts around when we walk down the isle in the market... and how they look away at the bank Why do you think your father doesn't come home anymore? What if it is not something I've done... what if it's who I am? Don't say that. Don't you ever even think that! You can be forgiven...maybe heavenly Father can forgive you for what you've done but who you are... He could never forgive something like that. You know... I think I am going to heat up that casserole with the cream and mushroom soup Where are you going? I left some stuff down the church... Now? We just got back! Our son... we've just come back from... As good a time as any Hello? Mrs Davis.. listen, I know you don't want me to speak with your son My son? Let me tell you something you son of a bitch Thanks to you my son took a razor to his wrists Thanks to you I have lost my son And I hope you burn, I hope you burn for ever! Chris? Sit down Drink that Toss it That way it's medicinal Good it's vital for a man to have a couple of slugs in him before discussing heart ache I think Hemingway told me that... You knew Ernest Hemingway? Margot actually But beauties don't always escape tragedy Oh God, this is hell... I've done something I'm guilty... and I'll burn for it Funny thing about guilt... there is nothing so bad that you can't add a little guilt to it and make it worse and there is nothing so good you can't add a little guilt to it and make it better Guilt distracts us from a greater truth... we have an inherent ability to heal We seem intent on living through even the worst heartbreak How? Practice I worked through in the studio... I can't seem to come up with a song for the single You? Couldn't sleep So what... you sit here in the dark? Hey. Let's just say fuck the no-carbs thing let's go to Dupar's and eat pancakes till we choke huh? Yeah... I think I'm just going to go back to bed Tuesday, 3 am, once again I can't sleep It's like I am waiting for time to fix some part of me that keeps on breaking I've already thrown out the newspaper and washed the left over dishes nothing to do but sit here and think As a citizen and voter in the city of Los Angeles it is up to you to decide if you will allow... Where are you going with my goddamn flowers But they are... We don't throw anything out that is not completely dead Deal? And another thing... you've got to quit coming over here and moping around, you're fucking depressing me I am depressing you? That's what I'm saying... If we've reached the point where you're dragging my day well then... we've got a problem... seriously you got to do something... it's time to make a move Find a way to get past this Are you being the Oracle right now? Nah... I'm just being a friend Hello may I help you? Are you Aaron Davis' mother? I am sister Davis yes I knew your son, in Los Angeles Ah you must be one of the elders from there you have that look No, my name is Christian He lost his watch I wanted you to know how sorry I am It kills me to think that I could have caused him any pain Wait! Could be worse... could be raining Oh yeah... it is raining Only in LA it does rain when the news has operation storm on Don't suppose there is bills of mine in that mail? Oh my God...it's a copy of my video.. What? Get outta here... it's about damn time Been waiting to see this Come on girl it's been so top secret plug it in, let's go OK, I don't want you to snap to some judgement... Why... It's some kind of like nasty-ass-Christina Aguilera's-can't-go-wrong-with kind of video? No, it's just... Tuesday, 3 am once again I'm wide awake waiting for time to mend this part of me that keeps on breaking newspapers I threw away washed the dishes in the sink What the fuck... That's from my journal what the fuck is that stuff from my journal doing in here You were the one always telling me to write songs about you... I was gonna tell you... or ask you or whatever... You knew I would tell you to go fuck yourself.. so you what? You'd steal my most private personal hell I've been trying to get past and you turn around and throw it back in my face is that it? I just thought that something good could come out of this Oh for you maybe... Jesus Chris... I did want to tell you Look... I don't want to tell you like this... but the record label they... want me to move to New York for a while cause... all the hot producers work in the clubs there Have a nice trip Help you? I was looking for Christian... Yeah um... no Chris is um.... Want me to give him a message or anything? I heard you didn't get the part I hate to admit it but I'm gonna miss you when you go back to New York Who said anything about leaving Come on, you hate LA Look if you tell anybody that I said this I will ripp your lips off I was miserable in New York At least in LA you can be miserable while you get a tan My dear boy I was hoping this was still good Of course it's still good I didn't have any place else to go Welcome Give my young friend whatever he wants What will it be... Just a coke, thank you Nothing stronger? You look like you could use it If you don't mind me saying you look like um... hell? Why? I didn't come to unload on you Well, you gave me that privilege once let me return the favour After we met I was sent home and excommunicated for being gay Your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals Well, I am definitely not joining Can't imagine heaven without both Sorry, go on That led me to a brief but disastrous affair with a sharp object After the hospital stitched me up my parents put me in this place this facility where they were supposed to change me and fix me this one night I was on restriction and I was cleaning this floor with a toothbrush that's when I heard it this voice it was like an angel It was just the TV It was the strangest coincidence I don't believe in coincidence these days I believe in miracles Maybe Because the girl who was singing she is only almost famous you wouldn't know her but I did And I know people feel this way about certain songs but I felt like she was singing right to me This is my young friend We've met I went by your place... I sublet it... Is this, this isn't... He's a great tipper Darlings the food is not gonna get warmer sitting on the counter Hot stuff coming through! A toast An affirmation A prayer of thanks I want you to know that wherever we find ourselves in this world Whatever our successes or failures Come this time of year you will always have a place at my table... and a place in my heart Sometimes it all still feels like a mass of dots but more and more these days I feel like we're all connected and it's beautiful and funny and good. with a little help from friends at Gayreactor
