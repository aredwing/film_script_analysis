Heh. - Oh! Oh! Whoo-hoo! They went crazy over my song. You're not supposed to be in here. So, what if I'm in here? You started learning What you don't need to know Where the sidewalk ends And the road begins I'll wait for you in the cold dark night You might come back, you had to go Where the sidewalk ends, I'll never know Hide from the future, run from the past I guess I'll stay here as long as I can last Whistles still blow but the train is gone Ain't no wheels gonna take me From my home Where the sidewalk ends And the road begins We said goodbye on a cold dark night I'm not afraid to go You bet I'm not Where the side walk ends, you left a lot I'm not afraid to go You bet I'm not Where the sidewalk ends I'm not afraid to go you bet I'm not Where the side walk ends, you left a lot Where the side walk ends, you left a lot Where the side walk ends, you left a lot See you next trip.

Hear them screaming? Ha-ha-ha! They went crazy! Over here, Dusty! That's exciting. What was Buddy Jackson doing in here? - "See you next trip"? - Yes. See you next trip. Since when do you start changing my show? Your show? I don't remember seeing you out there making those people scream. What is your problem, Dusty? I'm tired. I'm tired of the smoke and the lights. It ain't me. It's not a cowboy bar with drunks sitting around a little stage. This is 20,000 people. They came to see a show, and they want to see a big one. Hell, they can't see me for all the smoke and the lights. They can't hear me, the music's so damn loud. I stopped singing out there for three bars. Three bars, and nobody even noticed. - What are you trying to say? - I'm saying I don't like it. I don't like the sets. I don't like the lights. And I don't like you sneaking your boyfriend in my bus. And I don't like you cramming his songs down my throat. He is your boyfriend, isn't he? My personal life is none of your business anymore. Well, maybe your business doesn't belong in my show. If it wasn't for me... you would probably still be singing in some run-down rat hole... for a bunch of fat cowgirls from Iowa. Yeah, and if it wasn't for me, you'd probably be a waitress there. - Uh-oh. - You listen to me. Guys like you who can sing are a dime a dozen. I can find another in a hot minute. Yeah, well, go find one, then. Fine! Relax. Just relax. - Sounds like you need a beer, brother. - You heard? No, thanks. Oh, yeah. Man, why does it always have to be like this? I mean, everything's gotten so complicated. Sometimes I just want to dump the whole deal. Including this stupid-looking outfit. Oh, hell, Wyatt, it's better than a real job. Besides, you're helping me pay my alimony. Man... remember when we was kids, we snuck out to that carnival? That one we snuck into because we didn't have the money. Yeah, with that fat, old... bald-headed guy with the sweaty armpits. Had that dancing chicken. Remember when he put that chicken on stage? We snuck around back. With one hand, he was putting the needle on the record. And with his other, he was turning on the stove underneath the stage. That chicken, his feet was burning. It started hopping all over the place, just dancing. Ohh. The dancing chicken. Hm. Yeah, sometimes I feel like a dancing chicken. You know what I always wondered? Why didn't that chicken just hop off the stage? - Sure you don't want one? - No. What are you gonna do tonight? Sit right here... smell the horse manure... finish down this six-pack, and go find me a fine-looking woman. Wife for a night. How about you? I think I'm just gonna take me a little walk. Take care. Hey, man, I'll see you around. Get his bags. What are you doing? Just wanted to feel like I was out in California. Where's Dusty? He took a walk. Where? - I don't know. - Knock it off, Earl. I'm worried. - Did you see him last night? - Yeah. What was he doing? Was he drunk? No. I was. Did he say where he was going? Yeah. Earl! Where did he say he was going? To take a walk. You boys are making me work. You know I don't like that. Oh, yeah. Right. - Hi, you. - Hello. Are you new around here? Yeah. Brand-new. Oh. Welcome. Well, thanks. Hello, Grandma. Did I miss the parade? What parade? You know, the one that usually arrives before you do. That nice tour manager... and all those bodyguards and the reporters. No. It's just me this time. I hardly recognized you without all that hair. Ha, ha. Oh, yeah? - Did you quit? - No. It's just a short pause. - So how are you? - Oh, hell, I'm fine. I'd like to quit. It's just getting bigger and bigger. - Starting to look like a circus. - I saw you over in Dallas. - That was quite an extravaganza. - Why didn't you call me? I'd have got you tickets and you could've been backstage with me. You were working. You don't disturb men when they're working. - Did you like it? - Of course I did. It was you singing. I love to hear you sing. - But... - It was loud, and I couldn't hear the words. Without the words, there's no song. And? I could've done without the smoke and the lights. - Yeah, me too. - But the kids liked it. - You kept my old guitar. - Yeah. I learned to play on this old Dove. Yeah. I kept it around in case you might want to play me a song sometime. No smoke. No lights. No amplifiers. No big-stage production. Just me and my guitar. - Think anybody would buy that? - I would. Bye, Grandma. I'll see you soon. Howdy. Want a beer? Yeah, I'll take a beer. Is there a rent-car place anywhere nearby? Where you trying to get? Louisiana. Shreveport. Here. I used to play in here years ago, back when I was in high school. Yeah, I know who you are. - You do? - Yes, sir. I tell you, the place hasn't changed much. No. No. If you played here, you earned this. It's on the house. Thank you. There is a General rent-a-car place just down the road. Okay. Appreciate it. My friends, Shreveport, Louisiana welcomes Dusty in concert. Dave, come in. Anything? Nothing, Lula. We have all the entrances watched. I'm too old for this. Hey, we can't hear it, man. Will somebody please tell me where he is? Put that thing away. One of you must know. - Earl? - How many times you gonna ask me? All right. All right, look. Dusty and I had a fight the other day. And I said some things I shouldn't have. And I'm sorry. But I can't apologize to him until one of you tells me where he is! - Are you cancelling the show? - No, I'm not cancelling the show. There are 25,000 fans out there. Some of them drove hundreds of miles to get here. And they're gonna get their show. He'll be here. Thanks, gentlemen. Y'all been a real big help. You're supposed to be out on that stage in five minutes. I suggest if you wanna keep your jobs, you better get out there. Dusty! Dusty! Dusty! Dave. Let's do it. Dusty? Dusty! Dusty! Dusty! Bring the lights down really slowly. More smoke. Now. Right now. I think we got it. Okay. Good. When you hear twin fiddles And a steel guitar You're listening to the sound Of the American heart And Opry music on a Saturday night Brings a smile to your face And a tear to your eye Whoo! - Harley, honey. How about a little dance? - Not now, Al. Oh, come on. Why are you always avoiding me? - Where are you going? - I'm going home. - Oh, come on. - Al, leave me alone! - Hold on. Where you going? - I'm going home. - Come on back in. - I don't want to. I'm going home. I don't like you. Leave me alone! - Leave her alone. - What do you want? - No, Al! Don't! - You better back off, cowboy! - Come on, there's no need to do this! - I said, back off! Leave him alone. Al, come on. - You're bothering the lady. - No, don't! Al, no! Al, that's enough! God! Why does he always do this to me? Al, stop it! - Hell, he started it. - Leave him alone. Stop it. - You should've stayed inside. - Leave him alone. That's enough! - Stop it, now. Just stop it! - Come on back in. Come on back in, now. Ahh! Ahh! Harley, my hand! My hand! - Watch your hands! - Open the door! Ohh! Oh, my nose! - Sorry. I'm sorry about your nose. - Leave me alone, Harley! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was a mistake. - Leave me alone. Why is this happening to me? I'm not afraid to go You bet I'm not Where the side walk ends, you left a lot Where the sidewalk ends And the road begins We said goodbye on a cold dark night I'm not afraid to go You bet I'm not Where the side walk ends, you left a lot Where the side walk ends, you left a lot Where the side walk ends, you left a lot Kill spot. Kill it. Listen to me! Kill spot. - Bobby. - Nice show, Lula. Thanks. When's Dusty gonna be ready to give me the rest of that interview? I've got a plane to catch in about two hours. I'm not gonna let Dusty do the interview tonight. He's been fighting a sore throat and I just wanna keep him quiet. Come on. I just got a couple of questions. It's no big deal. Hey, Lula, it's a good show, huh? Can't do it. My first responsibility is to Dusty. I gotta go. - Wait a minute. - Sam. I want you to take Mr. Louis to the airport. See he's taken care of. Catch you in Vegas, okay? You are really starting to wear me slick. We're not playing games. Get in the bus before somebody sees your face. What the hell you doing? - I'm going in this bus. - No, that's Dusty's bus. Well, tonight, I'm Dusty. You don't want my fans to get suspicious, do you? You don't belong in there. Lula, you better get over here. We have a problem. Peckerhead. Well, what do you think? Buddy, we were real lucky. If there was one glitch with the tape... - ...if Bobby Louis had come much closer... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hell, aren't you even gonna thank me? Yes. Yes, of course, I am. - Thank you. - Good. Then we can... We can go celebrate. Lula. The guys in the band would like to have a word with you. Get him out of these clothes before someone sees him. You bet. Ah, hell. You guys were great tonight. What the hell was Buddy Jackson doing out there? Why didn't you just cancel the show, rain check it or something? We can't play with a guy who's lip-synching. If we speed up or slow down, he can't follow us or the audience will know. Where is Dusty, anyway? Buddy Jackson? Have you lost your mind, Lula? If I hadn't done what I did... all of those people would have gone home mad. And we... would all be out of a job. Now, I am sure that your ex-wives... and Henry's five kids and Keith's mother... don't care if it was Buddy, Dusty... or King Kong up there on that stage, so long as you get your paychecks. You know I have always taken care of you guys. Now... we've got a little time off before we get to the big show in Vegas. Everything will be straightened out. Dusty will be back. I'm gonna tell you something. I need you to promise me you will not say one word... to anybody about what happened tonight. This is for Dusty's sake. - And your own. - For Dusty's sake? I'm sick to death of your crap. You had him hung up and twisting in the wind. He had nothing to do with this. Tonight was all you, Lula. He had nothing to do with this? He walked out. And he left you and me and everyone in this room sitting on their thumbs. - He had everything to do with it. - You should have cancelled tonight. I ain't gonna be a damn dancing chicken in your freak show. Get yourself another drummer. Earl. Hey, Earl. Let's do it. Why the hell not? - What day is this? - Friday. Oh, my. The show. - You know horses? - I know a few. I'm sorry. I was... a little drunk last night. Yes, you were. My name's Wyatt. Wyatt. Well, Wyatt... you can't drink. And you can't fight. Can you eat? Yeah, I think so. Okay. Might as well have some breakfast. Before you go. Well, come on. Excuse me. You can sit over there. Sure do appreciate your hospitality. The hat. Sure is good. Harley. You were nearly three seconds long on that pattern this morning. I got in late. Maybe you should just get in a little bit earlier, you know. We all need to win this time. - Hey, Harley. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - I felt bad... Don't be like that. Why do you have to start this all the time? Go back in the truck, go home! Who was that fella last night? I've never seen him around. None of your business. It's not like you know him or something. What's the deal? What right do you have to tell me what I can and can't do! Go! - You made a mess out of me last night. - Excuse me. Why don't you just shoot me and put me out of my misery. - I'm sorry about that. - It's okay, it's not about my nose. I don't want you coming here and telling me what I can and can't do. - I am not telling you what to do. - You do it all the time! I'm tired of it! - How long have we known one another? - Don't you start that. I'm not starting nothing. - You all right? - I'm fine. Just go back in the house. Go ahead. Yeah. Don't you remember that beating you got last night? Me? You look like the one who took the beating. Not by you. I whupped your ass. - Oh, really? - Yeah, really. What's the matter? Were you too drunk to notice? Stop it! Just stop it! Stop it! Now, we were all drunk last night, and I'm sure we're all sorry. Come on, Al, get in your truck and go home. Me? Why should I? This drunk is staying. - Look, Harley, honey... - The lady said to leave. Boy, you're just begging for another ass-whupping, aren't you? Absolutely. What're you doing? What're you doing? Just go back in the house. Go! - Oh, my nose! - Go back in the house. My nose! Just go! Ahh! My hand! Oh, God! - Come on. - It's busted up right now. He busted my nose again. Get my hat. Sure is a beautiful ranch. About how many acres y'all got? Yeah, I can't blame you for keeping quiet. Kind of hard to get a word in edgewise with those three. Yes, sir. People talk too darn much for my taste. Yapping about this and that when they ought to be... eating, working or sleeping. What's anybody say that everybody doesn't already know anyway? - Can you tell me that? - No, sir, I can't. That's too bad. Take, for example, this morning. Now, we all know that Harley was slow on her ride. We know she was out late last night. That's no front-page news. So why talk about it? I guess I see what you're saying. You guess? Never guess. You got to know. I mean you got to know what you're doing. If you guess, you're leaving yourself wide open to suggestion. And that, to my mind, is what's wrong with this whole country. I mean it's going straight to hell. Everybody's open to suggestion. Well, you coming or are you just gonna sit there? - How long've you known Harley? - Not very long. - Thousand. - Pardon? - Uh, thousand acres. - Oh. Used to be more. - What happened? - Well... Getting to be a business. I'm a rancher. I don't want to be a businessman. And taxes are getting harder to pay. People want to buy us out. Seems like we wind up selling it off, bit by bit. I'm kind of glad I won't be around long enough to see it all go. And Harley? Well, Harley thinks she's going to save it by winning at the rodeo. Would you excuse us for a minute, please? You rope pretty good. I've always wanted to learn how to do that. - Good luck. - Any chance you'd give me some lessons? Ha, ha, ha. J.W. Did you hear that? This guy wants us to give him roping lessons. I'll pay. In advance. In advance? Yep. Wondering if maybe you might want to rent out that empty bunkhouse too. I could pay room and board. Maybe stay a little while. Take some roping lessons. Okay. You want to buy a rope? You mind telling me... - why you can't stand still for one minute? - All right. I just don't believe you're telling our problems to a perfect stranger. Our problems with this ranch are none of his business. If he's such a perfect stranger, what are you doing bringing him home? He got knocked out defending my honor. Was I supposed to leave him lying there on the ground? - If you hadn't liked him, you would have. - I do not like him. Then why is he making you so nervous? I'll be right back. What's he doing on a horse? - Well, he bought it. - He what? - He's gonna be staying with us for a while. - What? For roping lessons and room and board. He's paying. What's your problem? You like him, don't you? Why does everybody keep saying that? "Lights and smoke swirling, his voice particularly strong... Dusty delivered the performance of his life last night in Shreveport Auditorium." Idiots. Idiots? Hell, they love me. They think I'm better than Dusty. Loved you? They didn't even know it was you. - Thank God they didn't. - Maybe they should know that it's me. Buddy... you've got a lot of talent... and someday people are gonna be spending a lot of money to see you. But these people paid to see Dusty. So did the people in Vegas who bought tickets for the show. And what happens if you don't find Dusty? I will. Uh-huh. Grandma Ivy? Who's there? - Earl Blackstock. - Who? Earl Blackstock. Wyatt's friend. You took us fishing. I know who you are. I just couldn't hear you. Why don't we go over here and sit down. It's cooler over here. You're looking well, ma'am. Thank you. I'm feeling pretty good. The rain is doing great things for your flowers. Yeah. They are pretty this year. He's not here. Tell you the truth, Grandma Ivy, I'm pretty worried about him. He took off and... He's got all this pressure and people just trying to get a piece of him, you know. It ain't surprising. But this one's different. He missed a show and... - That just ain't like him. - Well, sometimes... the tree grows too fast. And the roots don't develop. And sometimes you have to chop off the top of that tree to let the roots catch up. - But do you know where he's at? - No. I expect if you follow the roots, you'll find him. Grandma Ivy, in all the years I've known you... I've never heard you answer a question directly. There are no answers. Only the search. Yeah. Whatever that means. It was great seeing you. Yeah, you too. - Take care now. - I will. Drive careful. Earl. Don't you leave home, now, without seeing your mama. Yes, ma'am. No. There's no sign of Dusty. Go, go. Come on. Yes! Yes! Come in. Bobby, no. I'm not putting you off, I swear. No, really. Dusty is working on some new material for the Vegas show... and he don't want to be disturbed right now. Yeah. Okay. Okay, I'll call you tomorrow. All right, bye. - What's the problem now? - It's Frankenstein. He's saying we better take care of him in case Dusty doesn't show up for Vegas. Yeah. This morning he asked me for a massage. Come on, Lula, I don't have to put up with that. I don't work for him. I know, I know, I know. But you guys do work for me... and I want you to keep him quiet and happy... - ...just a few more days. - Yes, ma'am. And I don't want him talking to anyone. Understand? Yes, ma'am. I'm still not giving him a massage. Hi, there. What do you think? Looks pretty nice, huh? Well... I think it'd look a whole lot better without that price tag right there. Oh. Decided to give Dusty a new look for Vegas. Drop the cornball stuff. Buddy, you are not going to Vegas. Dusty will be back. Come on, Lula. Dusty is a joke to people on the cutting edge. He's a farce. Since when do you know anything about the cutting edge? I talked to this reporter last night. She wanted to know the roadie's view of Dusty. She said she thought the whole show was pass. What are you doing talking to a reporter? She bought me a drink. You know, I got to thinking afterwards... here I am saving the day... yet I'm not getting anything. No one even knows it's me. No one's gonna know it either. - That was our agreement. - I know. But everything happened so fast, I didn't have a chance to think it through. I mean... I think I ought to get a recording contract, at least. And money. How much money? A hundred grand. Yes? Oh. Hi, Sam. No. No, Dusty's not going to be making it down to the station this trip. Yeah. He's gonna be real disappointed too. Tell you what I'm gonna do. No, I'm gonna send you and the guys some CDs. Okay, you take good care. Okay, bye. A hundred grand? You are out of your mind. You know, Lula, it would have been... awful easy to tell that pretty reporter the whole story last night. Don't you threaten me, Buddy. That's the thoughts of a fool Thinking out loud She loved me so - Hey. - Hey. - Can I get a cold one? - Yeah. But I was untrue She's gone for good What can I do That's the thoughts of a fool Thinking out loud - Does Pete Shanks still own this joint? - Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna come down there myself in the morning. Just keep on him. Okay. In all the world You will never find So you really can play that thing, huh? Two horses? He really needs a little exercise. J.W. usually helps me out, but he's not up for riding. - And Tim's still out doing chores. - So I guess I'm nominated. Well, if you don't mind. So how come a beautiful girl like you isn't married? Well, I almost did once. What happened? This good-looking stranger came into town... and he said all the right things and did all the right things. - And then he went back. - Back where? To his wife. - You didn't know? - No, I didn't know. Of course. - I'm sorry, that was stupid. - No, it's all right. I'm over it by now. It just... It makes you wary, you know? Hard to trust people. I trust you, though. Why? I don't know. Just something about you. You married? No. You ever been married? No. - What the hell is that? - I don't know. Hey, brother. - You look like you're doing all right. - That's Earl. Earl, this is Harley Tucker. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. I'll take the horses. You know, I hardly recognize you. Clean-shaven, short hair. You look... pretty. Younger. I should've known you'd find me. How'd you do it? Something to do with trees and roots. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Grandma Ivy. - So you've been playing some? - No. You're a flat lying cur-dog, I tell you. He talks to angels and the stars start to spin He thinks of troubles that he's gotten in He recalls how his heart got broken And how it's still that way The king of broken hearts Doesn't know he's a king He's trying to forget other things Like some old chilly scenes He's walking through alone I guess you two have played together before. What, she doesn't know? Earl and I played in a band back in the old days. Speaking of the old days, you'll never guess where I went. I'm gonna right a great country wrong That was quite a show you two put on back at the ranch. It was fun. It was more fun than I've had in a long time. You're quite a talented man, Mr. Wyatt. And you're quite a woman, Miss Harley. I belong That I'm gonna right a great country wrong Once upon a time You had time to love me And once upon a time I brought you pain if only we could only start all over I'd never leave your loving arms again And I'm gonna right a great country wrong I've never felt a feeling quite so strong I'm gonna hold you till the heartaches fade And all the pain is gone I'm gonna right a great country wrong I'm gonna right a great country wrong I'll be right back. Yeah. Mama used to tell me Look before you leap I made a promise that I would It's one I just can't keep Try to be careful And look out for myself My mind is on my side But my heart is something else Looking like it's gone way over, yeah It pulled me down and tore me apart After all you put me through I'm still in love with you What's the matter with you? Haven't you ever been in love before? Ahem. You like dancing with my husband? Looking like it's gone way over, yeah It pulled me down and tore me apart After all you put me through I'm still in love with you I've got a crazy heart Crazy heart - Come on, Grandpa. we're going home. - What's the problem? You son of a bitch! How could you do it? How could you stand there... and look me straight in the eye and lie to me like that? I just don't understand it. I trusted you. Come on, we're going. - What the hell is wrong? - Don't! Don't! I don't want to see you near anybody in my family again! Do you understand me? No, I don't. It pulled me down Tore me apart After all you put me through I'm still in love with you I got a crazy heart Now still being true Oh, man. Dusty. It's time to come home. That's me. Underneath that Dusty hat, that's me. Where the sidewalk ends And the road begins We said goodbye On a cold dark night I'm not afraid to go Harley, this is Wyatt. Man, I can't believe you two. Us two? I swear to God, Wyatt, I had nothing to do with it. She must've had me followed or something after I walked. Hell, you walked out. Went home. I followed you just... Just like I always do. How was I supposed to know you didn't want to be found? I didn't even know myself. You should've made that show in Shreveport. I intended to. - Things happen. - Well, man... nobody missed you. Lula just cranked up the fire on another dancing chicken. Lula. - Yep? - I want to see Buddy Jackson. Haven't found him yet. Find him. Soon. You're certainly good at that. That Shreveport concert, I want you to reschedule it. I'm gonna do it for free. If we do that, everyone will know you weren't there. We can't let anyone know that. You don't know what I went through to save your ass. Those people paid to see my show, and that's what they're gonna get. What choice did you give me, disappearing like that? Forget about me. You got a whole band with families to support. Did you think about them on your little holiday? They're the only reason I'm here. What are we doing out here? Where are we going? Just taking a walk. You know what happened while I was gone? I remembered I could still play a guitar. And I can sing. And I remembered I used to enjoy it. And I'm good at it, so that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna play the guitar and sing. No more smoke. No volcano blast. And no more light shows. Just gonna stand on that stage and sing? - Can the whole show? - That's right. We've been doing this for a long time together. You can do this with me... or I'll do it by myself. That's it. Whoa! Ugh! - You all right? - I'm fine. I'm fine. - What was that? - That was me. I wasn't concentrating. I just can't concentrate, damn it. Just forget about him, Harley. He's no good. You got a rodeo in three days in Vegas. Get him out of your head. I wish I'd broken his jaw. Today, an entertainment exclusive. It's Milli Vanilli in reverse. A member of country superstar Dusty's road crew reveals an amazing secret. Yes, I impersonated the guy through the whole concert. The TV! Quick! Come here! The band was live, but the voice was on tape and I lip-synched to it. See, his manager offered me a hundred... Lula Rogers offered me $100,000 and a recording contract if I'd keep doing it. That's him. But she changed her mind? Maybe she found somebody else. There's no telling how many different guys she used before me. - Where's the real Dusty? - That, I don't know. Dusty ends his phenomenally successful road tour this weekend... at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. Country Music Network will be there to answer the question: Is it Dusty, or is it Memorex? We'll be back with more from Country Music Network after these brief messages. Okay. This is Monique James, Country Music Network... and we'll try once again for an interview in a minute. I owe all of y'all an apology. I put each of you here in this room in a difficult position... leaving the way I did, and for that I'm sorry. I guess I kind of lost track of... what our real job was. Maybe we all did. In the early days... it was all about the music. We did it because we loved it. Lately, it seems like it's just for the smoke... and the glitz and the money. And it's real easy to get caught up in that. I know I did. I think We all did. That's what happened to Buddy Jackson. And that's why he did what he did. We got a lot of fans out there who don't trust us anymore... and tonight I'd like to get that trust back. I want to thank y'all for coming in and staying with me... and I'd like to see the band in my room later on this afternoon. Harley, I need to talk to you. This has just been a big misunderstanding. Harley told you she don't want you around. Can't you at least respect her that much? Look, she's told you once, don't come around. She don't want you anymore. Ernest. You know, it's a funny thing about that little white speck on top of chicken shit. That little white speck is chicken shit too. Fans, as the competition's been keen here in Las Vegas this week... remember the City of Neons brings you the best rodeo in the world. We've got cowboys and cowgirls from all over the world... but we've got a beautiful lady from the state of Texas that'll be next to go: Harley Tucker. The time of 16.30 is what we're running after for the big bucks. Here comes your pretty lady, Harley Tucker. One turn to the right, two to the left. Las Vegas, get ready to have a Texas lady take the money home! One more turn to the left and we're gonna be that horserace fast, happen right here. We're off and running! And the number is 16.30. And the clock, we're looking at 16.26! That's what it's all about, folks. All right. What did you tell her? I was just calling you. Dusty. - Well, how you doing, Buddy? - I'm doing great. - You're not so smart, are you, Buddy? - How's that? - This little charade you been pulling. - I don't know. I'm getting an awful lot of media attention. I can barely keep reporters from knocking down my door. I'm a pretty popular man. Everybody knows who I am. That's pretty smart. Yeah, but I think you're forgetting a little something. - Like what? - Like a little matter of fraud. That fraud you been committing on 60,000 unsuspecting fans. Especially when Lula here offers you all that money and a recording contract. Come to think of it... - ...I think that qualifies as extortion too. - What? Of course the only person who'd have to press charges is me. - Wait. She didn't give me any money. - What? - You mean you've been lying to the press? - Hold on, Dusty. No, you hold on. I want you to disappear, Buddy. If I ever hear of you making another comment to the press... if I ever see your face around country music again... I'll sue you so fast you won't believe it. Now go on. Get your ass out of here. - Can he do that? - Yeah. Go on. Get your ass out of here. This isn't over yet. Yeah, it is. Thanks. Harley Tucker. - Yeah. - Hi, I've got some tickets for you. - Tickets? - Who is it? I'll pick you up in the limousine at 7. - Limousine? You got the wrong room. - There must be some mistake here. Are you the Tuckers? Harley, J.W., Tim and Ernest? - Yeah. - No mistake. Whoa! We're live at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas... where recent allegations by former staff member, Buddy Jackson... have left Dusty fans in a turmoil. We were unable to speak with Dusty, but his long-time manager, Lula Rogers... promised he is here and he is ready to give the best Dusty show ever. Look at these seats. Enjoy the show. - Are you Miss Harley Tucker? - Yes. Could you come with me, please? Someone would like to speak with you. I'll be back. - Mrs. Chandler? - Yes. - Hope your ride from the airport was all right. - Just fine, thank you. Shorter the ride, the longer the car. Showbiz. What's going on? Wyatt, I know this doesn't... change anything... but I just wanted to apologize. Next to Earl, Lula, you're my oldest friend. You're due a few mistakes. You knock 'em dead. Let's do it. Dusty! Dusty! Dusty! Ladies and gentlemen... the Mirage Hotel and Casino proudly present: Dusty. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I gotta do something a little different tonight, so if you'll indulge me this... I'll appreciate it very much. Could you follow me with the spotlight right down here in front please? Our love is unconditional We knew it from the start I see it in your eyes You can feel it from my heart From here on after Let's stay the way we are right now And share all the love and laughter That a lifetime will allow I cross my heart and promise to Give all I've got to give To make all your dreams come true In all the world You'll never find A love as true as mine You will always be the miracle That makes my life complete And as long as there's a breath in me I'll make yours just as sweet As we look into the future It's as far as we can see So let's make each tomorrow Be the best that it can be I cross my heart and promise to Give all I've got to give To make all your dreams come true In all the world You'll never find A love as true as mine And if along the way We find a day it starts to storm You've got the promise of my love To keep you warm In all the world You'll never find A love as true as mine A love as true as mine.
