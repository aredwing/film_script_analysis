Thanks for coming back for Inauguration Day. But you're not getting the President to protect. Not quite yet. You look a little shaky to me. I feel okay, really. You're getting One Momma. - The First Lady? - Don't hold it against me. One of the hairy-chested Hollywood types... tries to keep wearing a jock strap. I've been reading and hearing about her. Let's say that you're going to miss the hell out of Nancy Reagan. In any case, it's nice to be back. Hi. - Killian, hey, good. - Killian, it's nice to see you. - How's it going? - Very good, real good. - I'm feeling good. - Good to have you back, Killy. - Thanks. - Killy. Hey, Charlie. Hey, Killy. Looks good. - You know our duty. - One Momma. I hear she takes no prisoners. I used to hang out with a dame like that once. She was a real equal-rights nut, but it got embarrassing. Opening doors for me, lighting my cigarette, patting me on the ass. Well, this is the way it will go. Briggs, you and Weems ride the point car. Tyler, you and Zipper ride the chase car... Charlie, you ride with me in One Momma's limo. Here we are at the steps of the White House. It's a crisp 22 degrees. The President elect has just entered his limousine. Hi. So, it's a cold day in Washington, but the people say the new president's hot. Stay tuned for later details and the president's wife. She's coming down. - Let's go. - I guess we better get into action. - Good morning, Mrs. Craig. - Who are you? - My name is Killian, ma'am. - Don't call me "ma'am." I haven't seen you before, have I? - No, ma'am... - I just told you not to call me "ma'am." - I've been on sick leave. - I see. I'm replacing Lee Barstow as Chief of Security. This is Miss Chang. And I must impress upon you, Mrs. Craig... how important it is that you do everything I say. It's very important, Mr. Killian, that you do everything I say. Today is the first day of a new administration, and I, for one... am not going to be coerced by your chauvinistic rules. Do you understand? I'm afraid not. - What the hell is this? - First Lady. - No way. - Tell her. Miss Sims, you're in the chase car. Mrs. Craig, we can't use this car. Of course we can. We haven't used an open car since 1963, Mrs. Craig... when President Kennedy was assassinated. Don't be an ass, that was different. I'm not a president, I'm a first lady, and in the whole history of our country... there has never been an attempt on a first lady. In 1815, the British laid some grapeshot on Dolly Madison's buns. Yes, dear, that was war. And, as you know, war is hell. Now, either get in... or get lost. Now, there's a mugging if I ever saw one. Mrs. Craig, it's not safe to sit up that high. You mind sitting back down in the seat? You're a real wart, Killian. If you don't get down, I'll have to pull you down. Killian, these are Italian shoes. They qualify as a lethal weapon. You lay one finger on me, and you'll get one in the southern hemisphere. That wouldn't work with me, boss. Want me to take her? Oh, my God, my eye. What happened to the cop? In the crowd, he may have been hurt. Oh, God, my eye. We'll get you to a hospital. Like hell. I'm not missing Cal's inauguration if this eye turns red, white and blue. Well, you're a cinch for one of those colors. Can somebody lend me a pair of sun shades? Anyone but you. As for you, Killian, out. You can walk the rest of the way. I'll take care of myself. It'll be much safer. "I solemnly affirm that I will faithfully execute..." "the office of President of the United States." I solemnly affirm that I will faithfully execute the office... of President of the United States. "And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend..." "the Constitution of the United States..." "so help me God." And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend... the Constitution of the United States... so help me God. Congratulations, Mr. President. I'm so tired that my hair aches and my teeth itch. Charlie, get me the file on a man named Reno Bracken. Aren't you overplaying it a bit? Came in to congratulate you, for being on your toes. Thanks. - Accidents do happen. - If it was one. - Meaning? - I don't believe it was an accident. Did that cop report in to his headquarters? Not yet, but we'll keep checking it. Killy, are you suggesting it was an attempt? I only got a brief look, but I'd swear it was this bastard. Which bastard? Reno Bracken. You look at the network tapes, keep an eye on the front tire of that bike. You'll find it wasn't blown normally. If you are serious, you be careful. It could have been you he was after. Will somebody please... Well, it's Reno Bracken, American terrorist, trained in Libya. He had a team of 11 murderous mercenaries. For a price, he'd waste anybody. I mean, anybody. A king, president, prime minister. That's when President Carter sent in a Delta Force with Killy at the head of it. Okay, I'll take the file. And I'll check out the tape. And keep clear of Madam Battle-Ax... while she's wearing that shiner you laid on her. Still shining, is it? Like the color purple. Hi. Hi, are those pants going on or coming off? Going on. Damn. This needs help. In the closet. When did you take the vow of poverty? Meaning what? How long have you been calling this rattrap home? For about 10 days. Since my final decree. You're finally divorced from available Imogene? - Yes. - That makes my day. And I hate that tie. So, she got a bucket of alimony and put you on welfare. No, it didn't go like that. When the judge heard she was patriotically trying to service... the entire United States Senate... he even cut her off from green stamps. Then, why this dump? She already looted our joint bank account. I've got a great idea. Don't you ever give up? Never. You know what the rules are. We don't mix business with that other stuff. "That other stuff" he calls it, poor man. It's getting late, and we're going to be late. Get my jacket. - You wanted to see us? - Got a problem? - You won't assign me back to the President. - The President's at Camp David. Meanwhile, One Momma is having her first press conference, 1400, East Room. It's an order. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, meet the first Lady of the United States. Thank you. Well, first of all, I'd like to thank the press corps for the very warm reception. I certainly hope the feeling lasts. Yes, Claire. About your dark glasses, everyone's very curious about them since... the rumor is that the President gave you a little black eye. The President wouldn't dare. He knows I can take him two out of three falls. Then who gave it to you? A very klutzy bodyguard. I mean, one more like him, and I'd be safer in Cuba. Is that why you missed all those inaugural balls? Claire, would you go out into the world wearing this medal of honor? Sally More, CBS. Mrs. Craig, exactly what happened with that explosion yesterday? Was that an accident? Maybe I'll let Mr. Killian explain that to you. Yes, it was an accident. Tire blew out. Then, it wasn't connected with the First Lady. No way whatsoever. - Mrs. Craig. - Mrs. Craig, please, Daily News over here. Mrs. Craig, isn't it true that you and the President... haven't shared the same bed since your arrival in Washington? - Would you mind identifying yourself? - Derek Finney, National Gazette. Isn't it also true, Mrs. Craig, that as a matter of fact... you and the President haven't been together since the convention? Does the Gazette qualify as the press? I had the impression it was manufactured strictly as wallpaper for local outhouses. - Touch. - Are you evading the question, Mrs. Craig? No, Mr. Finney, just the answer, because I know... that no matter what I say, you've already written your libelous version. - Mrs. Craig. - Mrs. Craig, please. Mrs. Craig, June Merkel, Washington Daily Tribune. Do you intend to involve yourself in government like Rosalynn Carter did? Her staff cost nearly $1 million a year. I expect I'll stick my nose in my husband's business... every day and night, especially to push the passage of ERA. Mr. Finney. Where'd you get that line on the First Lady, Mr. Finney? You fellas know I don't have to reveal my sources to you. But it's straight from the horse's mouth. You know, yokels who shoot off their mouths get their mouths shot off. Are you threatening the freedom of the press? No, just you. I warn you boys. Y'all will be reading about this. We better not. The ship of state's developed a leak. Just make sure it didn't come from our team. Killian, you've been to more of these clambakes than I have. How did you think it went? - Very well. You're very fast on your feet. - Thank you. Incidentally, how did I draw you again? I specifically asked Fitzroy to replace you. That's a coincidence, because I was talking to Fitzroy... about replacing you in four years. Come on, Killy, wake up. - Come on. - What? Get with it, Killy. Wake up. What the hell is going on? One Momma broke out of the White House without any security. - That's impossible. - Sure it is. That's why she's being held at Andrews Air Force Base. Marine One is picking us up on the South Lawn. I don't know how the hell she got out. - Where is she going? - California. John Hammond. Jay Killian. You did well. - Thanks. - Where is she? Inside. I'd approach her from the side, she's a high kicker. I've been there. - Who's he? - Pilot. We checked, he's been cleared. You again. Yes? No use arguing. The President's cleared her for the flight. I'll have a limo for you at the John Wayne, Newport Beach. Go. Oh, boy. "Oh, boy, " what? Oh, boy, am I going to miss Nancy Reagan. This is November Charlie 4-3-3-9... calling Marine Operator, San Pedro, California. This is Marine Operator calling Spread Eagle. This is Spread Eagle, over. Cappy, you old rum pot. I'm three hours out, and I'm on the way in. That's fine, Miss Laramie. I want Dad's yacht fueled and ready for two weeks at Catalina by the time I get there. The hell you say. What's wrong, Cappy? I called Dad at Tahoe, and he said it was okay. We're high and dry and the ways is getting the bottom scraped and painted. To hell with that, just drop her in the drink and send her on home. The fuel tanks are sucking air. Cappy, you fuel up and buy stores for two weeks at sea. And you be at the house by the time I get there... or I'll have your guts for garters. Washington hasn't sweetened that temper of yours, girl. Spread Eagle is clear. I'll be back. Mrs. Craig, can I sit with the pilot awhile? Yes, dear, you do that. Let Wally teach you how to fly. I already know how to fly, ma'am. There you are, Killian, I thought we'd lost you. Moonlight becomes you. It's the best seat in the house. And the most appropriate. All right, let's go. Okay, let's go. Have you been to Newport before, Killian? Since I was 17. Used to go there on summer vacations. - From where? - Arizona State. Prison? After that, I spent a lot of time there during the Nixon years... when the western White House was at San Clemente. - Where are you from, anyway? - Tombstone, Arizona. - You ever hear of Kirk Killian? - Yeah, Western writer. My father. I read a lot of his books, Killy. He was very good. Thanks. He brought us to Tombstone because he wanted to do some research on Wyatt Earp. My father is buried there. - On Boot Hill? - Where else? Sandy. Hey, Mrs. Craig, welcome home. Where's the boat? She's coming down the bay right now. Ahoy, Cappy. Ahoy, Miss Nervy, got the stores on board, going to top off the tank right now. Wait a second. Why don't you pull alongside now, and we'll all go with you. The hell we will. Never mind, Captain! For Pete's sake, Killian, I've been climbing on and off that boat... for the past 10 years without so much as a hangnail. You're not going aboard that boat until it's been inspected. I'd take care, mister, she knows karate. Thanks. Pull on up. - That's good. - Is that all right? - Put it on forward. - Got it. There you go. Ma'am, are you planning to go to sea on that boat? That's what one generally does with boats. One goes to sea in them. - I wish you had told me earlier. - Why? I have to call in a team from the local branch of the service to go over it with a fine tooth comb. That'll take hours. Maybe days. Damn you, Killian, you have no right. Yes, I do, ma'am. But Calvin gave me permission. He said it was okay. - The President gave you permission? - Yes. He knows better than that. Come on, Killian, have a heart. This is Dad's place, I used to live here. I practically grew up on that boat. She's perfectly safe. - Are you all right, Mrs. Craig? - I think so. I'm okay. Will you look at that? How's that for the luck of the Irish? Briggs, get on over there and see if anybody's alive. Right. Tyler, call Fitzroy, tell him what happened. Poor Cappy, I've got to go see if there's something I can do. I'm sure your friend, the captain, is dead. We're in luck. Fitzroy says the Vice President's in Los Angeles. We have air force Two for the turnaround. Rendezvous John Wayne Airport, one hour. - You and Briggs stay here. - You'll have to go without me. - Can't do that. - The President's ordered us home. - Especially you. - The hell with that. It's my belief that somebody just tried to kill you. That's ridiculous. You're overreacting. What happened down there was a tragic accident. It's not the first time a boat's blown up while taking on fuel. A gasoline-powered boat, yes, but your boat was a diesel... and they don't explode without some help. They're sending you in a helicopter back to Washington. Lee Barstow and his team are going with you. She's called the President from the plane. He's not too happy. - I don't give a damn. - I'm not too fond of her myself. - Killy. - Yeah? I have a great idea. - I'll bet you do. - Your place or mine? Your place. That's wonderful. What happened to you? You just outlasted me. - You enjoyed last night? - I never slept better in my life. Slept? Did I miss something? Sailor, you didn't miss nothing. Charlie, get some clothes on. That's not what you said last night. Why don't you move in here permanently? I don't want to die from a terminal orgasm. Hello. Hi, Tyler. Yes, he's here. Finally. - Where are you? - I just got in from the coast. - Did you find out anything? - You bet. The first thing I did was hire a diver to check the boat. It was in 10 feet of water, so he had to go to the engine room. There was one explosion, came from the keel, up, C-4 plastic, not limpet. I called Dr. Hoxley at the Orange County Coroner's office. He said that Captain Ogilvy and the cook were killed by shrapnel and debris. There was no water in their lungs. Okay, better get some sleep. Right. One other thing, Sandy Ott identified the barnacle man. Who is he? His name was Pritchard Young. No one seems to know anything about him around here. - I'll be talking to you later. - Right. The yacht was definitely blown up premeditatedly. Then there's no doubt someone is trying to kill One Momma. Do you think this is Reno Bracken's own idea? No, not a chance. This is big. Treason? The highest, I'm afraid. Thanks for a really nice night. I think you deserve two in a row, don't you? Maybe. And I'll get even better after the wedding. Nobody mentioned marriage. This is the number-two man to Bracken, Pritchard Young. Yes? Senator Bunsen of Hawaii wants to see you in his office as of right now. Okay. That was Fitzroy. Seems like Bunsen wants to see me. The Presidential Advisor and Chief of Staff? We got trouble. - Aloha. - Aloha, Senator. Spoken like a native, brother. Been to my islands? Yes. What do your friends call you? Just Killy. Killy, I'm afraid we've run into some stormy weather. Doesn't matter whether the First Lady is right or wrong. She doesn't like you. She's colored the President's point of view. I didn't mean to plunge the new administration into the abyss of despair. That's very funny. The fact is, with my seniority... I should be attached to the President, not the First Lady. That's true, but not possible right now. I've had a few run-ins with the iron maiden, and she doesn't forgive very easily. - Shall I slit my wrists? - Madam prefers castration. No, thanks. I've had a few tilts with the lady. She's a very difficult woman and a bad influence on the President. Somebody else feels like that. I don't follow. I think somebody's trying to kill her. - I've thought of that myself. - No, Senator, I'm serious. That's pretty unlikely... but coming from a man with your experience... I would say it's a fact. I'll look into it. Meanwhile, you stay away from her. We'll put another team on her. I'll give the President your point of view. - Thanks. - I'll be in touch. Loudermilk called with some screwball message. "897-1600." Okay. Don't "okay" me. What does it mean? There are 897 steps to the top of the Washington Monument. "1600" means 4:00 p.m. So, why the cloak-and-dagger routine? When we were going through our divorce, Imogene bugged all the telephones. It was the only way to have a private conversation. Ingenious. Okay, Killy. Find out anything? I don't know, but I found a cockroach in my phone. This might be more private than anything else. I have to go on leave for a few days. I want you to take over until I get back. What's up? I wish I knew. Listen, let's keep using this system in the meantime. Be talking to you. - Yes? - Killy, are you on a rest cure or what? Why, Senator Bunsen ordered me to take a week or so off... at One Momma's suggestion. Senator Bunsen doesn't run this office, neither does Madam Battle-Ax. I run it. That means you should consider coming to my office for a powwow at 8:00 a.m. - Short layoff. - You mind sitting down? One Momma is going to make a speech... in front of the student body at Washington-Lee University... in Lexington, Virginia, tomorrow afternoon. Our Barstow team is her security. She'll be flying out on Marine One chopper. Isn't it awful we missed her? Yeah. Jokes, Miss Chang. This mission may not turn out to be so damn funny. I'm sure that you're all aware... that we maintain a sky watch on the roof of the old executive building. To shoot down any aircraft that invades White House air space. All right, we keep an arsenal up there, rockets, with two-man sentries. Right after midnight, those sentries were taken out with tasers... and four rockets were stolen. Are you guessing Reno Bracken took them? For security reasons, the flight will proceed from the White House... to Round Hill, Virginia... then over to Winchester. And we turn south... to New Market, which is down here. Then Staunton, down here... and then finally to Lexington, Virginia. Isn't Robert E. Lee buried right there in the chapel? He is. We have over 200 miles... where the bad guys can get loose one of these heat-seeking missiles. Any ideas? You'll have the usual pair of gunships on perimeter? They won't go for the gunships. Instead, we could use Marine One as a scout ship with ammonia guns. Which are what? Only monkeys and man emit ammonia in this way... and it can be detected from long distances. Gives us early warning. Aren't we risking the First Lady's life in a chopper? She won't be on it then. Let me explain. I should have known it would be you. What the hell is going on? I'm sorry, ma'am, I felt... No, not you, let him tell me, and don't call me "ma'am." Well.... Majesty, somebody doesn't like you... and they're going to try to shoot the bird down. We thought you'd be safer on the ground. Would you mind getting in the car, please? My horoscope said it was going to be a rotten day. And you've just made it that. Honestly, with your sense of paranoia, shouldn't you see a shrink? If you feel the same way tomorrow, ma'am... I'll even let you make the appointment. How do you like Lee Barstow and his team? About the same. Male arrogance, invasion of privacy... using security to push me around. But he's more of a gentleman than Mr. Killian. I was raised in a poor neighborhood. - How can you stand him? - I've got a very strong stomach. Killy, the red barn up ahead, we have a positive reading on the sniffer. Take a defensive position. Damn! Bet that was Bracken. We'll still get that son of a bitch. Seems this time I was mistaken. You might say that. I suppose you'd like an apology. Screw you. Well, that won't be necessary, ma'am. Hey, Killy, you're not falling for that bimbo, are you? The First Lady can be many things, she can be a dipsomaniac... or a kleptomaniac, she could even be a nymphomaniac... but she can never be a bimbo. Nevertheless... are your salmon swimming upstream? Just having the last word, Killian. Thank you. - Senator. - I have no time... - Make time. - I don't like your tone. You said you'd call me after speaking to the President. The President has taken you off the First Lady's protection. I agree with him. These terrorist attacks are aimed at you. Anyone in your vicinity is in danger. You ought to play the ponies, Mr. Killian. Your hunch was right. The body was booby-trapped. Well, there goes the neighborhood. Back up, they're coming through. Why kill the kid? All he said was the people upstairs weren't getting it on. Well, maybe somebody up there doesn't like the news. But why kill him? If I were you, I'd worry about Bracken. Yeah, I need a change of address. - You need a food taster. - Are you volunteering? I'm going to reassign you to a new surveillance. I want a 24-hour watch on One Momma's secretary, Polly Sims. - Have a heart, Fitz. - No crap, Killy. - That's an order. - What about my seniority? That will get you the day shift with Charlie Chang to cover. Just in case Miss Sims goes somewhere that you can't. And I get the moonlit nights in huggermugger heaven, I suppose? I'm only trying to keep your ass out of the war zone for a while. - Where do you think she's going? - National Museum of American History. How do you know that? Because that's where they exhibit all the Inaugural Ball gowns... from Martha Washington to Nancy Reagan. And today, One Momma is gifting them with her gown. She went into the ladies room, came out, she left her bag in there. Go back and keep an eye on the bag. So, you made me. What the hell are you up to? It's been fun on the merry-go-round, but I'm running out of tickets, ma'am. Please, don't call me "ma'am." Okay, but what are you up to this time? I'm running. You know I can't let you do that. Yes, you can, you must. I know you were angry when they assigned you to watch Polly... but I ordered that because I'd soon be playing Polly. And you're the only one I can trust. You arranged this? I had to. I was desperate. Please, bear with me. Leave your car here, and come with me in mine. Please. Okay. Just sign for one room. What? You know what the media could make out of that? For God's sake, Killian, you don't think I'm making a pass? For crying out loud. I guess not. A married couple will attract less attention. They'll be looking for a single woman. Sign for one room. You're right. You can't just disappear. You're the First Lady. I'll call Cal, he'll cover for me. Till when? Till the Secret Service find out who's trying to kill me. I don't like saying this, but has it ever occurred to you... that the President might be the one who wants you dead? Never. - It's your life, you're betting on it. - I know that. Will you help me? Please? Okay, I'll do it. Thank you. But you're going to have to do as I say. Starting now, you make no telephone calls to anybody at any time. I don't see why. It's either that or else. If you say so. - You ever handle a gun? - I've done skeet shooting. I want you to keep this with you in case you need it. It's loaded, the safety's on, all you have to do is pull back the hammer... - and then the trigger. - It looks awfully little. May be little, but it shoots a .410 shotgun shell that will take a man's face off. I'm going out to make a telephone call. There's a phone right here. Internal phones can be listened in on. If you're calling about money and stuff like that... I've got $25,000 in traveler's checks. In whose name? Mrs. President? My maiden name, Laramie Royce. That's smart. Hello? Charlie, don't have a lot to tell you. I'll call you again Thursday, 897-10. Roger that information. 897-10. But don't hang up on me. Damn you, Killy. - Get dressed. - What? It's Pritchard Young, the number-two man. Get dressed. - That was really horrible. - Yes, but necessary. We've made it to Pickett's Charge. 15,000 men were killed here. Now it's 15,001. - Charlie? - Where are you? Don't ask questions, just listen. One Momma's running for cover, and I'm going with her. About your car, I paid a guy $100 to drive it back to DC. He's going to leave it at the Watergate parking lot. I'll call you again, Wednesday, 897-12. Wait a second, are you trying to melt that iceberg? Charlie, consider who she is. Mister. Mister, did anyone ever tell you... that your wife looks sort of like the president's wife? Her head is big enough without any help. Greyhound again? - You ever ride a motorbike? - Of course. I don't think $6,000 is such a bargain for a pair of used bikes. They'll never look for you on one of these. How do you like me as a redhead? You look like a cross between Little Orphan Annie and Lassie. That's not very nice. Actually, you could wear Medusa's snakes and still look good. Why thank you, Killy. I thought you were immune. No, it's just that when a sign says, "Keep off the grass"... I keep off the grass. I obey the rules. Can we change the subject? I'd like some answers. I guess I owe you that much. Derek Finney was murdered because he asked you a question. A simple question. Yes. Everybody knows that your husband, the President... was a hero when he was in the Air Force. When his F-111 had a flame-out over Atlanta, Georgia... rather than bail out and risk the lives of a lot of people, he rode the plane down. You checked records? Yes. Especially the hospital records. And because of the crash, and as a result of the injuries.... Cal was my first lover. We met at UC Berkeley. In politics, a bachelor has a poor future. Calvin needed a wife, otherwise he'd have been passed by as the candidate. He's a good man. I've always had faith in him. I wanted to help, so we got married. We made it as romantic as we could politically, nationally. Yes, you two did clown it up for the public. It was agreed that once Cal was safely in the catbird seat... I could do as I pleased. I could either go along for the joyride... or get a discreet divorce. That ties it up. That's the hitch. There's no hitch. It's enough of a hitch for them to chase you across the country, trying to kill you. Don't you see? If you divorced the President... he wouldn't stand a chance of being reelected. But as a widower.... Cal would never hurt me. How could he possibly have known where to find us? - You okay? - I'm still shaking. Is he dead? I don't know, and I'm not going to risk your life finding out. We'll go. What a relief. I'm glad to see the back of those bikes. Board! You folks have a good night's sleep. What are you grinning at? The way you jumped up there, you would have thought you sat on a snake. I didn't want to get you all excited. I don't need Secret Service. Was it exciting? No, just heavy. Goddamn you. You could've lied just this once. I did lie. You weren't just heavy, you felt like a ton. You are an insufferable ass! And since you like to be top dog, you take the top bunk. I was wondering about where you got your name, Lara. Was your mother reading Dr. Zhiyago? No, it was nothing like that. My father was making a movie in Wyoming when my mother went into labor. He had to drive her 70 miles into Laramie, where I was born. So, they dubbed me Laramie, which eventually was whittled down to Lara. Good night, Killian. Good night. - It's going to be an historical day. - Why? First Lady returns to the city of her birth, Laramie, Wyoming. You're right. It's the first time I've been back since that fateful day. Is that trouble? - Could be. - Is it Bracken? Damn right. Conductor? - Why are we stopping? - Some sort of emergency, sir. We're getting off the train. Get in there. Here, take this. How'd they know you were on this train? - You call anybody? - Only Cal. - You dumb little... - Watch it, Killian. You've been reporting our whereabouts to the President? After all, he is my husband. I trust him. Board! What are we going to do now? We'll hitchhike. Get in. Good morning, Chief. Thank you for picking us up. That goes for me, too. That's real nice of you to pick us up. Do you speak English? Do I look like some goddamned foreigner? I'm sorry. Of course, I speak English. Also Crow, French and Spanish. I'm a native-born American Indian... not some half-breed immigrant like you all. Why all this "mmm-mmm" and the war paint? Tools of the trade, tenderfoot. Hello? Your husband said I could use the... The can and phones are around the side. And that crazy Kickapoo ain't my spouse! We'll take this one. My nose tells me somebody's hot on your tail. What makes you say that? You didn't ask how much. If I was a white man, I'd overcharge you for a mistake like that. You're pretty smart. A dune buggy can go cross-country. $2,000. I'll throw in a couple license plates. What about that nose, Joe? Don't worry. It didn't get this long by poking it in other people's business. Mama, give the man $2,000. Bracken's probably figured out we got off the train back there in Lodgepole. So? He'll be looking for us on all the main highways. - Where the hell are we going? - We're going to take the back roads. Once we get to Nevada, we'll be home free. God, in this awful rig, I won't have a face left! $1 million is a lot of money for near misses. Terror is a very expensive game... Senator. Get on with it, or I'll hire a hit man to hit you. You've got a big mouth, Senator. Big enough to swallow a short-fused grenade. Now, don't ever try to mug me. Killian, I've been thinking. That we're heading into a trap? Well, if Bracken's been getting information about what we're doing... he's going to know we're coming here and be waiting for us. Well, I'd rather you were here because I've sent for part of my team to meet me. Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk? Lamb for the slaughter? What a way with words. Couldn't you put it another way? What about "worm wriggling on a hook"? Forget it. I'll take the lamb. Who did you say was coming down? Loudermilk and Miss Chang. God, Daddy'll have a fit. God, Daddy, you look good to me! Things are that bad? It wasn't the yellow brick road. Daddy, I'd... And you'd be Killian. - Yes, sir. - Harry. - I think we ought to get under cover, sir. - Sure thing. You have a very grateful father here. - How about a drink? - Sure. I'll get it. - The usual, Daddy? - Thank you. Is something bothering you, Killian? Yeah. I'm concerned about this whole thing. I heard a rumor that you didn't like people very much. You seem friendly enough to me. I never met a man I couldn't corrupt, but you might be an exception. - Now, how about... - Damn it, Daddy, don't start. Killian's staying at the White House with me and the President. Now why all this sudden affection? Didn't Killian expect.... You called and talked to your father about all this? Why the hell don't you go on the TV? Easy, Killian. I'm the only one she could trust. Any idea who is responsible for all this? Without a doubt. Chief of Staff, Hector Bunsen. My big problem is proving it. Why would Hector... want to destroy my daughter? Well, he knows the President is impotent. And he knows that your daughter might divorce him in a year or two. And as a divorced man, he wouldn't stand a chance for reelection. But as a widower, he'd be a shoo-in... and Bunsen would continue as the man behind the throne. Yeah. My son-in-law is nobody's stooge. We have some visitors. That's part of my team. It's good to see you, Killy. Same here. Come on over and meet Mr. Royce. What's new on Bunsen? He's still in Washington under Fitz's hawk eye. Did Fitz take out a warrant? That won't help. This is agents Chang and Loudermilk. - How do you do? - Meet Mr. Royce. - Sir. - How do you do? Sit down. Why won't getting a warrant work? You're dealing with a very powerful satrap. And even if you had all the proof in the world... he'll take it to the highest court and embarrass this administration... into total obscurity. What would you do? I might take him to the dirty tricks department of the CIA. They give great heart attacks. Charlie, get Mr. Royce in the house. Cover me. Looks like Bunsen hired the right man. You're damn right he did. Senator Bunsen, Joshua Paul, FBI. Would you come with me, please? Good morning, Senator. You son of a bitch! Gentlemen, ladies... as you've known for some time... Chief of Staff, Senator Bunsen, has been in failing health. It saddens me to relate that yesterday he died in his sleep. The President wants me to tell you how grieved he is at the loss of the Senator... and how much we shall miss his statesmanship... here in the White House, as well as up on the Hill. - Is the rumor true? - Which rumors? You're assigned to guard the President now that you're fit again. - It's the other rumor that's true. - I don't understand. The rumor that I'm going to resign from the Service. That's true. - Oh, no. - Yes. I'm going to miss you. It won't be for long. I'll be out there, in Nevada working for your father. My father? - He hired you away from the White House? - That he did. That low-down, conniving, wicked... See you in Tahoe... Ma'am. Au revoir, Killy. Don't call me "ma'am." Now, you're sure you never had a roll with that tootsie? No, Charlie. No tootsie rolls. And there'll be no googly eyes after we're married? Nobody said anything about marriage.
