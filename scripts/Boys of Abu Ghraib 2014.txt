Happy Independence Day. Happy Independence Day. Squadron. A small military unit, forming a platoon. Esse Ryan Fox, kid-military propaganda. He is the third generation. This is the Rodeo. Always smiling. I think he is a fierce man. And this is Gable, the opposite. Esse Babatunde Ogundule. He is from Nigeria and no one can say his name, then the call Tunde. And this is Eugene Fowler. There it is, guys. But the call Pits. That's my platoon. These are my brothers. Ladies and gentlemen,-PRISON, IRAQ soldiers of the U.S. Army, the 1.1km behind these walls will be their homes the next six months, until the new year. The largest detention facility of the United States in the world. Bigger than Guantanamo Prison. We keep here the greatest terrorist in the world. Existing worse. So here you are, the best soldiers of the free world. The acts of intelligence here has global impact have sure. This is one of the most dangerous plants in the world. Just 32 miles outside of Baghdad. Every day, we are attacked by mortars. Insurgents try to breach these walls. So what happens within these walls historians regard as war front line! -Roger that? -Roger that. Within these walls, their families are safe. Hurrah. Within these walls, the war on terror will be won. Hurrah. Welcome to Iraq and Abu Ghraib. Will the new year before they know it. Hurrah. The barracks was originally there in tents, but exchanged with detainees when the mortars began. And no generator. So ensure batteries for their flashlights. Right here, boys. -Thank you. -See you there. -I have priority. -Come on. That shit. What the fuck, man? Oh my God. Must be kidding, right? What is? May not be so bad. All right, no whining. What hell is that smell? Human ashes. It is a crematorium. This is not good. There is blood on the floor. Okay, guys, 25 minutes. Come for vehicles. What the heck is rolling? Guys, this was Saddam's cell. -Tortured 40,000 people here. -Oh really? Burned, starved him and hanged them. His son, Uday, peeling foot sole players in Iraq when they lost a football match. After the drowning in hydrochloric, acid swear. That shit, man. Looks like there are bones and tombs everywhere, supposedly. So, watch your step. These cells are very comfortable, staff. Everyone, get down! Are you kidding me? Put it there. You brought it? Has good smell. Has good guy smell. What r u doing? I'll throw it away. We are in the fucking army, face. Cresco. Oh my God. Days in Iraq: Day-one. Guys, welcome to the vehicle industry. It's good to have new faces around here. We are positioned between the two roads dense blown up in the world. The more transport missions occur, we will have more work. Sometimes it's chaotic. Sometimes, there is nothing to do. I know I asked this before, but collaborate with me, okay? The base is weak as the patrolling. We do not have enough members to care for thousands of inmates. So volunteers are asking the police to cover shifts. I can liberate some of you. So if anyone wants the opportunity, talk to me. Nobody went to the police because the Soldier Ferrell. Who is this? If you're the police, has one of the two duties. A: care for hundreds of inmates in complex external and some may be innocent. They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Others are very bad. They fill you all day. You turn a adult babysitter. Two: you work in the safe side, caring for some of the sickest people in the world. There are things that you can not even look. Are you understanding? The Soldier Ferrell signed up to the police a few months ago. Took place at the safe side. Just giving a shot in the foot. By accident. Fuck that asshole. Soldier Ferrell shit. He is at home watching the football preseason Jody on Bars and drinking pia colada. I'll kill that bastard, if you see it again. This place is already miserable enough. Trust me, take it easy, try not to be blown and will be fine. That, Going up chasing you First I will catch you I got you now Shit! Here, motherfucker! Dude, what the fuck? You could lock the door. It is broken, idiot. Oh my God. Man, this is pretty ridiculous. This bed is bullshit, man. Farmer, nobody told you about here bring flashlights? No, man. Okay, I'm leaving. This place has things -Scariest I've ever seen. Come on, Tunde. All these people were killed here? Do you believe in ghosts or what? I'll buzz right now? I hope you wake up and your penis is fallen. Porra! Mortars, mortars ... Come on! Come on, come on! , Porra! -Merda! We will. It was. Come, come, come! -Go back! -Go, go! Move! Go! Sometimes ... Go! Do not want to die, man. Doctor! Doctor! I do not want to die here. -Medical. -Doctor! -Watch out. Please, help me. -Do something. Dude, hold it steady. Look at me, man, look at me. Here, man, is here. Please look at me. Let's leave you-bom. -Stop it mess. My God, look at me. -Well, he'll be fine. Do not let me die! You will go home. They will lead you home. You will return to your girl. You'll be fine. Boy, look at me, okay? Let's get you home. -Do you promise? -Promise. Stay here, stay here. -I did not know. Look at me, man, look at me. You will not die. -You will not die. -I do not want to die. Stay with me, stay with me, man. Do something, damn it! What are you doing? Do your fucking job, man! Are you okay? Look at me, man, look at me. Shit! Porra! Mas to fuck ... Days in Iraq: Day two. We soon realized that, rather than a threat, motivational speech from Captain Hayes was just that ... A speech. We are not soldiers from the front line of the war. Days in Iraq: We are very well trained and underused. -My Lord. -Here he comes! Day after day, do the same thing. A is indistinguishable from the other. Stuck in a rut endless. Days in Iraq: We do not have phones, email, TV or internet. We spent our free time drowning the chagrin of days in steel bars ... Shower ... Dinner. And then we sat outside until dawn. Sitting by the fire makes it seem like we're home. "Alright, Gable, I'm glad you're here" "It's nice to see a pair of breasts, but I do not care" "We are relaxing in this place" And no Iraqi will blow this place. Is Farmer. Is Pitt. Day 28. We're still no phone. We invented games. What we are scorpions. In Abu Ghraib, not fight rebels fought with each other. We do not fight terrorists. We fight boredom. Half-kilometer-Less. But. We do not collect information. We do not save lives. Do not follow the global laws. Days in Iraq: Begin to remember. New Year. Days home: This is my war. Come in. Good afternoon, Mr. Farmer presenting Sgt. Rest. How can I help you? I wonder if you still want to volunteer for the PM. PM, why now? I want to make a difference. Think you do not? The car industry has many men, sir. My talents can best be used. You talked to your Sergeant? Yes, sir. How old Farmer? Twenty-two, sir. Do you know what is safe wing? Yes, sir. I have a vague shift. It's yours if you want. Thank you, sir. When you end your turn in the car industry, submit to the secure wing at 17:00. Sacked. -Mr? -Yup. And the training? I have no experience of PM. You'll be fine. Good afternoon, sir. Welcome to the safe side. Sergeant. -Tanner. -Farmer. Why are you whispering? Better take off his shirt. A shirt? -Is. If they know your name, they send anthrax to his family. -OK. -Come, I'll show you the place. Thank you. Well .. This bucket is for water. This is for sewage. Guess who has to empty them. Also gain sheet. Do not let them cover themselves in time to crap. -Why not? -Humiliation. It is a way for the amaciarmos Intelligence. Also, isolation. Detainees can not talk to each other. With neither do you. Okay? Do not talk to a detainee under any circumstances. -Except to give an order. -OK. -What is it? Position-stress. Another technique used to calm them, Without causing much damage. -Shit ... It hurts? Of course it hurts. Look at this guy. The Military Intelligence asked we let him ready by tomorrow morning. Standing for 32 hours. I told him if he falls he will be electrocuted. I think the morning is ready to talk. Farmer. Look, the first time I've seen it all, also found it very strange. -Yup. -Get used to it. Remember why you are here, right? They are cold-blooded killers. They are laying bombs mortars and play the wall. OK? We find that killed two of us. None of compassion. Right. -That's basically it. Give them space, ronde every 10 minutes and make sure not to do anything you should not. Like what? Talking with each other, shitting on the floor exercise without permission, masturbating. It's a delicate balance. If fumbling with you have to go up. Take the privileges. Take the clothes, the table, let a song all night. Handcuff them to the bars, do not let them sit. Do this until you listen. Right? Some are harder than others, but in the end all yield. Once they do, they are yours. Should we do this? Of course we should. The command expects you to do your service, soldier. I understand? Yes, understood. So that's fun. Look. Chewy! Chewbacca! It is hard to recall records and names are unpronounceable, then invent nicknames. This guy here, the latest figures from his record are 1010, then called Twenty. This is Mr. Clean, for obvious reasons. And this one ... The call Jimmy Dean. This does not yet know. The call Stay Puft, the Ghostbusters. Other usam Rosie O'Donnell. Here we have the Old River. Very quiet. Finally, we have this motherfucker. The call of Bartender. He frequently serves cocktails. What is a cocktail? It is a mixture of feces, urine and other bodily fluids. -Oh my God. -Is. The put here to prevent the hit. There newcomers arriving tomorrow, so be here. If you need anything, I'll be in another block. Alright. We do not have enough PMs, so pay attention ... You must be aggressive, right? If you feel weak, have problems. They stick a nail in her throat without hesitation. Remember, this is your pack. -You command. -How so? I mean, we are the American army. Should not we lead by example? Farmer, what the hell are you talking about? These guys are who capture American journalists behead them slowly, film and send to the world, and you're worried with panties on their face? Looks like an ordinary Saturday night for me. I do not know, guys. I think many here have done nothing. Bullshit, man. Learned that one 13 years was arrested for playing football near the patrol. No, these guys are out there. Level two inmates. Farmer is the secure wing of shit. What's this? This is where intelligence remains the most valuable prisoners. You see someone questioning? No, no specific staff for that. What training did you receive? No training, actually. They just throw you in there with a lot of crazy, and if they see you? Enough of this sad talk, makes me want to slit my wrists. I'm trying to keep me calm, writing a song for us. -How so? -What are you talking about? -A song? -A music. It's a fire, we'll do the singing. -Time Music! -Listen, this is music. It starts like this ... The guys from Abu Ghraib say that we know Who always protect us wherever we go Finally, the baton. A little more participation, yes? True, the second verse is ...

The Abu Ghraib prison, where Saddam Hussein was a prisoner, tortured and murdered, is now the site of shocking photos ... Castings from prison, showing U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners of war. Michele William est ao vivo em Washington. -Michele? -A warning to viewers. The photos are disturbing and explicit. Show American soldiers committing abusive acts with Iraqi prisoners were hooded naked and stacked in human pyramids.
