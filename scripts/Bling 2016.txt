Give me the ring, otherwise ... - Take it. - What are you doing? Fools. What ...? The ring! Fire! I'm coming, friends. It's good to see you. If Mads get the ring, says Sus "yes" for him. Then we can keep the show. - And we are heroes. Give him the ring. - But it's wrong. I just want to hear Sus say "yes" for courtship. Nothing else. You are the best robot friends. What happened? Oh no. Hilmer! Give me the ring. - These are my friends. - Friends? Impressive. - Mads! - Is it really Mads? - Mads? - Yes, Mads Johansen. - Now give me the ring. - No I will not. Never.

We're trapped. Hilmer! - Connector of Mads. We manage Victor. - I can not leave you in the lurch. Come on. Valentine's Day is soon over. We'll be all right. Hey! You got the ring. Now you need to have the girl. And whatever happens, so to her. Watch out for yourselves. I need you for the wedding. You have come into my black book, Mads. - Did you get my ring? - As you gave me instructions. Hit it. Now we can finally go ahead with the plan. Open the door. What a glorious moment. Robots forward with flags. So we go to the theme park. We must tell Mads, the fun will smash everything. Can you find him? Snout magic. Are they in the parade? Stay alive, friends, so I will deliver the show. - Free Just. - Free now. Free now. Freedom Now. Free now. There has passed 20 years. How long should I wait? - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Thanks. - Sus, I want to ask you something. - What is it, Mads? Sus. My Goodness. Wow, look at how big the ring is. Wait. What's Mads? Is there something wrong? I can not. I'm sorry, but it is wrong. What did he say? Reach... If that is how you feel. I leave town my reportage. Where are you going? I said yes to a job in London. London? But it's so far away. It does not have to wait for anything, that never happens. - Have a good life, Mads. - Sus, now let be. Goodbye. It must feel nice to be super villain again. It evokes wonderful memories. But only for a while. Of course. The wedding. Today is the happiest day in my life. I'm sorry to ask, but why you will give up everything for Katarina? I give nothing for her. On the contrary, in fact. - All I have caused her. - I do not understand. I've loved Katarina very long. It is because of her, I have become who I am today. She asked me to keep me away from her. I did not meet her demands. So I had to love her at a distance. She was so beautiful. One must be a great man for to marry a Kastanjenborg. And great men gives only large rings. Just wait and see, Katarina. I'll be a great man. So you were just super villain to impress Katarina? Exactly. So you can thank her for, that you even exist. And with this ring she can do, you do not exist. Wake up. You have devoted your life to to force the world to its knees. - You live and breathe evil. - Victor, you make me afraid. And now you want to give it all up? That I can not agree to. I want you again leads the way in a diabolical, destructive plan. - I want my Oscar back. - Driver, stop the car. Get out. - Pardon? You're doing just nonsense, right? - Out! That can not be true. After everything I've done for you. Who is this I see? The bad boy. We can not continue to meet thus. Here, take it. I can hardly believe my luck. - What was that? - For the greatest gift in the world. See you later, kid. Sus ... Sus. I have three minutes before my big speech. - Let's clear the interview quickly. - Yeah okay. - Is there something wrong? - I'm fine. Mayor, Valentine's parade draws to be a great success. It must be said, Sus. And I would like to thank all ... - Katarina, my love. - Or not all. Guards stop him. - Listen to me for once. - Why would I? - Otherwise, you will regret it. - What are you talking about Oscar? I talk about it here. What? It is not my ring. - Guards! - But Katarina, listen ... Victor, it's the wrong ring. Pardon. You mean this ring? - What are you now doing? - Take rather against my ring. otherwise smashes the great Oscar-robot city. Victor, give me the ring. Have you gone crazy? What are you doing? I do, you have built me. I behave myself hurt. Your dolt. Give it to me before I melt you. - First let me polish it for you. - Stop! What are you doing? Oops. Diamonds are obviously not forever. My ring! My ring! Listen. From now on Valentine's Day be known as the day - - I, Victor, destroyed your city forever. Fire! Oscar, tell me right now: How do we stop it? It should be a beautiful celebration. The robot, Oscar. How do we turn off it? It can not, Victor has crushed the ring. But if you stop Victor, you can stop the robot - - The associated via motion control. - Come with me. I have an idea. - Where are you going? Jack, film it. Latest news: Chaos in the theme park. Sus Kastanjenborg report. A giant robot is just surfaced. It crushes everything in its path. If it is not stopped, The whole town can be at risk. Sus, beware! No, who can stop this madness? - How long should I wait? - Great men gives only large rings. No, Katarina. It's not on the ring. It's about me. We've just heard, the Oscars henchman, Victor, - - controls the robot with some kind of motion control. Oh no, the robot is moving toward the city. Several million people are at risk. It's terrible. No one can apparently stop it. It's funny it here. Sus! Finished with the bad boy. Come, Sus. We must leave. I can handle this. Wait. "Wait"? I am tired of waiting, Mads. There has passed 20 years. Fair enough. I should have asked you anything before, but ... I wanted, it had to be something big. I know, it is not just the time. But it is perhaps my last chance. I've made a fool of me, every time I have tried to ask you, but ... I was afraid. I was nervous. I thought I should give you a large courtship, a huge ring. But that is not it, for so I am not. Sus. I love you more than life. So there is probably no other to say than ... - Sus Kastanjenborg. - It's just so pathetic. Will you... Sus! Mads! Not again. All that love makes me sick. From now on, we celebrate Saint Victors today. With total destruction! - Hello friends. - Good to see you again, Mads. - Push, Mads, push. - Sad creatures. - Are you alive? - I will not die. I am too young. Mads, where are you? Come out and play. I think I can save Sus, but I will need your help. - Follow the Plan. - I got you now. Should that be true love? Your beloved flees. So real is love. Heroes! This way. What? WOULD YOU MARRIED YOU WITH ME VICTOR? I hate marriage. - What's wrong? Give los. - I am nervous.

Now nothing can stop me. - Mads! - Oh no. - Oscar. - I love you. I love you. - Guards, apprehend the man. - No no. Let it go. Let it go. I was a great man for your sake. No, Oscar. You were a great villain. But I would go straight, if you married me. Your problem is that you do not know what love is. - Do you know when it? - Let's go. Call me, okay? Katarina, I love you. Mads Johansen, think that I am saying it here, but you are a great man. Thanks. Johansen, you've outdone yourself This time. My park is completely destroyed. It is smashed. Then it heltetid, Mads.
