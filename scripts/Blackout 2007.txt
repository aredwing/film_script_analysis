Pay our friend George a little visit, do an inspection, get some comments from the tenants. Hear what they have to say. If I don't like what I hear, then he's gone.

You've been out of the single arena too long. -Oh, my God. -Ain't nothing out here. D, it's not about being single or anything. It has nothing to do with someone else. So then what's the problem? We've been having financial problems, like, this past year... Let me tell you something, Claudine. Jobs, finances... They come and go. But I've always admired you and James' relationship. And it would be a shame to see it fall apart on the account of things you two have no control over. You understand? I'm sorry about that. I... He's an idiot. I always tell him serve the customers with the food first. Oh, it's all right, Ali. I can wait. It's no problem. No, you deserve... You demand that kind of attention. You're a strong, decisive queen.

You know you trying to put it on a brother today. I know you don't think you came up here just to give me one round, right? Come on, I don't... Don't even come at me like that. You know I'm a heavyweight. -I hear you. -You hear me, all right. -Yeah. -You gonna be hearing me in a minute. Oh, good thinking. It's hotter than a motherfucker out here.

You weren't asleep or something like that, were you? Why would I be sleeping in the middle of the afternoon? Look, George, I'm gonna be straight with you. I've been starting to get some complaints from the tenants about your keeping up with the maintenance of the buildings, and I mean, maybe you're getting a little old. Something like that. If that's the case, I'm gonna have to replace you. And if I do that, unfortunately, I'm also going to have to remove you from this apartment. Now, look. If you want to get rid of me, and you need a scapegoat, well, then you just go right ahead. You're not fooling anybody. I mean, you know these buildings are run-down. We're getting a little ahead of ourselves here, okay? That's why I came personally, George. I'm here, personally, so that you and I both can go check on the conditions of these apartments with the tenants. We'll talk to them, we'll make an assessment, we'll come back down here, we can just talk reasonably about the whole matter. Is that all right with you? -As you wish. You're the boss, boss. -All right, let's get started. -Y'all think Kobe did it, man? -No. No. There's no way my man could have did that. His wife way too fine for him to be doing that shit, B. You know what they say about every fine woman out there. There's a brother behind her that's tired of hitting it. Yes, sir. Nah, nah. I don't see Kobe hitting nobody. I don't see it. I know, but that's what a man get for fucking with them white chicks. Oh, here we go. Now the woman in you want to come out. How come every time something like this go down, the sisters wanna bring up the white girl issue? Nel, you ain't pay your bills, dawg? Now what? -What's wrong? -My hair. -Huh! -Look at my hair!

Happened when, about five minutes ago? Okay, well, it happened to everybody at the same time. We checked our circuit board. It's not our fault. It's not our building. We got to see... Maybe the whole block's electricity has gone. So we'll go next door, we'll check them and see what's going on. All right, okay. All right, okay. I understand. I understand. I didn't turn off... Police news and special report. The Northeast... ...power outages, blackouts, if you will, all along the Eastern seaboard, specifically in the Northeastern U. S. New York affected, Detroit, Toronto, Ottawa, as far west as Ohio. as far west as Ohio. In New York City, JFK, LaGuardia, Wall Street all experiencing major outages. Just how widespread these outages are is unclear at this time and whether there's any connection among any of them is unclear at this time. Well, I'm glad this happened in the daytime. Yo! Yo! Get some money over here! What are you doing here? Yo! Yo! Yo what the fuck is wrong with y'all, man? Get out! Yo, kid, you heard? There's a blackout in the whole city! Yeah, I know, we heard.

I don't have no reception either. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What if James got stuck in one of those trains in those tunnels with the temperature so high. Wherever he is, I'm sure he's fine. I hope so. How are you going to go get Little J in Bed-Stuy? By foot if I have to. I'm gonna keep walking. Hopefully, I can catch a cab or a express van or something. -I don't know. -Hopefully. You know, bin Laden has something to do with this. -You think so? -Yes, man. Where is he? He should be here by now. -Probably got stuck in traffic. -You think I can get a cab at the corner? -Let's do it. -All right. You know, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. "Searching for service." Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing. I don't even have one of those things. This is a low down dirty shame, people! That even on doomsday, you can't find it in your heart to help a fellow man. That's why it's about to get crazy. This is nothing but a plot by the government to kill off all the black people. The original man... Hey, come on, taxi! Taxi, come on! ...until every last one of you niggety-negroes... MAN: Oh, shut up! ...is dead on the floor. Like that. Hey, taxi! Come on! Maybe we better go back to my apartment until you can get a hold of your guy. Port Authority says no trains or subways are running... What's up?

I know you. Stop following behind those niggas, Ty. For real. You will end up in a real bad place and I can't help you. -Yo, C. -Yo, get off me, son. All right, man? What's up, B?

But damn, can't they wait till the evening? I'm saying, it's daylight outside. I see you, nigga. You know what I'm saying? Crazy. Hip-hop and R&B, 24/7 for the NYC. I'm telling you, ain't this nothing? Biggest blackout in American history on the hottest day of the year. What is it, like 98 degrees? No air conditioning working. I hear people over at Harlsborough Projects are assed out. They're calling me up like, "Asia, girl, "you know, we ain't got no water, no air, no gas, no nothing. " I'm telling you, devil's playing games. Give me a call, though. Let me know what your story is. Where you at? What part of the city? What's going on? What you doing up north? -That's right, that's right... -Just chilling. I'm saying. I feel you, man. -I'm scared. -What the fuck's up? I could've stayed locked the fuck up north, man.

Everybody got a solid motherfucking hustle. Know what I mean? Cops out here just going in niggas' pockets. Prez out there sticking niggas up for their oil. Let's walk over to the Holy Land. I'll bet you all them camel cocksuckers are open. Cactus-drinking motherfuckers keep water and food. And you know Wisdom got to keep his commissary full. I smell something. Somebody's barbecuing something. We need some grills or something out here. Go down there and get some chicken. No, I'm chilling. -Hold this. -Send her down there. She done. -I'll be back. Okay? -All right. Didn't your mama tell you to go into the house? -No. -Yes, she did. -No, she didn't. -I think she did. -No, she didn't. -Whatever. Oh, shit. Shit! DeeDee, man, wake up. Why the fuck you didn't wake me up, man. What time is it? Oh, shit, I gotta go. -Yo, CJ, how's your mother? -Just chilling. She's fine. Start heading inside, it's going to get dark, all right? -Yeah, I will. Have fun, enjoy it. -All right. Oh, my God. -Babe, are you okay? -Yeah... Hey... -Listen, I'm sorry I'm late, you know... -You sure? Wait, how did you get home? Hey, you made it home. Yeah. I trekked it all the way, too. I was worried about you. I was worried about you, too. I tried calling you. Ditto. Oh, God. Same way I always get home baby, by train. How's that possible? What do you mean, "How's that possible?" What are you talking about? How'd you get home by train? You know, I caught the train like I always catch the train. -Hey... -Wait, Reggie, what was you, on some kind of magical train? I mean, was it running on batteries or something? The power's been out in the whole city since this afternoon. Baby, you know, I didn't have a problem catching the train. Maybe my train was... Running on a special train. Hey, we're running late let's go get this thing going... What are you doing, man? What's going on? Where were you, Reggie? -What do you mean, where was I? -Where were you, Reggie? -Where were you, Reggie? -Hey, baby, you know I got to... What were you doing, Reggie? What were you doing?

Get the fuck out! -Listen, baby... -No, get your shit and get out. Get the fuck out! Well, I just wanted to make sure you made it home safely, you know? I should probably make my way out. I didn't pack all my stuff, so I have to come back later, okay? I don't think it's such a wise idea to go out there tonight. I mean, I don't... I don't see what's the reason why you can't stay one more night. Another evening with me isn't going to kill you, right? Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right. Hey, the fridge is still cool, you know. None of the food is spoiled. That's good. -Are you hungry? -Yeah. You're probably hungry. Got some food on the stove. -I'll go get it. -Okay. Okay. Hi. This is Susie. I'm calling from Chelsea. And I just wanted to say where I am right now, things are really kind of beautiful, you know. We're all sort of hanging out together and taking in and helping each other, you know. And there's a guy on the corner with like... And my neighbors have a whole bunch of extra water that they're carrying out to people. And the kids are all playing out on the street. It's kind of like a big street party, you know. And we're all just pulling together and enjoying the time together. It's a great time for us to get to know each other, actually. So, I know it's still so hard, but we're having a good time and pitching in... I don't know, it's like the spirit of the city is really coming through. -What's up, man? -Chilling. I'm good. It's 8:30. Yankees game. You got ESPN? I don't think we're gonna have any television tonight. You're right there, of course. That's the reason I'm stuck here to begin with. Idiot. -You're a baseball fan, huh? -Oh, yeah. What are you, kidding? My dad use to take me down here to Ebbets Field all the time when I was a kid to watch the Dodgers play. I actually saw the great Jackie Robinson play ball. Jackie was cool with me. He was one class act. You say that kind of like you knew him personally. I can go better than that. We used to play on the same team. You played ball with Jackie... Okay, before I get very excited here, let me ask you something. Are you just some old guy who maybe fabricates and exaggerates his life a little bit to make up for his shortcomings? You calling me a liar? I'll throw your ass out in the dark. No, no, I'm sorry. Just checking. Sorry to interrupt. When I was a young man, I was quite an athlete. After World War ll, when I got discharged, I was signed by the Negro League. The Kansas City Monarchs, 1946. Had a great roster. Lot of talent on that team, Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige... Wow. I got traded that season, though, to the Newark Eagles. The Eagles, right. You know, the Newark Eagles and the Kansas City Monarchs played in the Negro World Series that year. Yeah. And the Newark Eagles won. Sort of a revenge. Poetic justice. I like to feel that I had a little part in that. Yeah. I can't believe I'm sitting here with a American Negro League world champion. George, that is... -So what position you play? -Center field. -You ever see Jackie Robinson again? -Nope. The next season he got signed by the Majors. And then after that, they started picking off all the colored boys, and so the Negro League just sort of dismantled. Yeah. I ended up in Brooklyn. That's where I met my missus. Been here ever since. -Thank you for dinner. -You're welcome, miss. What happened to your face? Some of the stores on the block were looted today. Just got into a little scuffle, but I'm all right. -Are you sure? -I'm good. Nine months from now, you know what it's gonna be. I'm good. A lot of blackout babies! So let's get it popping. We have a lot to talk about, you and me. -Okay? -Okay. I'm sorry... Yes, I was a bit frustrated about our money situation. However, all I kept thinking about today was you. I felt terrible for being on your back this morning. Today put a lot of things in perspective for me. About what's really important. I just... I don't want to take you for granted, okay? I'm sorry. Look, I felt the same way, you know, not being able to reach you and all. But first off, I'm just glad you're okay. Look, ma... I got something important I want to tell you and... What is it? I'm not doing good, you know? I need some help. You know, with the recession, losing my job, no work, you, me, everything... You know, at first I could deal with it, you know? It was natural, I'd shake it off. It was good, you know, it was all right. But it's not easy no more, it's becoming more and more difficult and... I'm struggling, you know. I find myself... I can't even walk out that front door sometimes. You know... Then I realized, you know, I was hurting... I was hurting us both by keeping it from you. You should have told me. We could have gotten through this together. It's... I want to get some help. Okay, I'm going to get some help to help me get back to being me. Okay. Because I can't lose you. No, you're not gonna lose me. -Mind if I ask you a personal question? -Of course. Shoot. We're sitting here, we're talking like two old buddies from talking about Jackie Robinson to fusion to everything under the sun. I guess what I'm trying to say is... What happened? What happened? Life happened. I'll tell you what happened. There's the life you plan and then there's the life you're given. Don't feel sorry for me, bro, I'm cool. I've lived five lifetimes already. You hungry? Yeah, yeah, I could eat. What you got on the menu? Franks and beans. -You got anything else? -Yeah, beans and franks. -I don't suppose those are firecrackers? -No, I don't think it is. I didn't think so. Yo, Ty! Ty, that's you? Yo, Ty, what you doing outside, man? Oh, my Lord. -What are they doing out there? -What else? Taking advantage of the situation. Come on, baby, close the curtain, okay? Come on. Hey, George. Did you ever seen that movie The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston? Of course. Do you remember that scene he's talking to all the Israelites, and he's telling them, "Stay in your homes and wait for pestilence and the Angel of Death "to go into the homes of the Egyptians"? That's how I feel right now, like we're waiting for darkness to pass. Feel like praying? Just kidding. Hey, would you like to stay the night out here? Yeah, maybe that's a good idea. I mean for both of us, right? Right. Yeah, okay. Good night, George. Good night, Sol. Yo, Ty, you out here? Yo, yo, yo! It's dark as hell out. Yo, Tyrone, stop playing, son, where you at? Yo, word to my mother, son. Don't make me hurt you, son. Yo, Ra, chill, son. Oh, you see me, man. You think I give a fuck if you see my face, cousin? Yo, Ra, chill, son. -Take your shit off. -Yo, chill. Yo chill, what? Bro, you ain't gotta do this, man. -Word. -Yeah, word. -No, you know me, son... -Word. I'm from your block. -I'm from your block, son. -Don't fuck with me. -Yo, we from the same block, yo. -That don't mean shit, partner. -Little fucking fancy nigga, boy. -Yo, Ra. You gonna beg me, right? Yo, chill, son. Fuck you doing? You's a dumb motherfucker, you know? That's why I've never liked your fucking ass! All you had to fucking do was run a jersey, nigger. And now you want to act all fucking hard and shit. CJ? CJ? Where are you? Okay. CJ! CJ. CJ, where are you? -Ma'am! I just want some water! -No! No! -Come on! I just want some water! -No! Stop flashing it at my face. Do something, man. Go get some clothes or something. Yo, son, let me tell you something, man. We about to fucking rack up today, man. Yo, let's not get greedy, son. We good. Let's bounce. Nigga, is you fucking crazy? Understand what I'm trying to tell you. Right now, tonight, New York is deaf, dumb, blind and she about to get fucked. Let me tell you something, B. When is the next time you think we gonna get a shot like this? You think there is gonna be another blackout like this again? You stupid? Yo! Go upstairs and get some sneakers, man! Bring them shits downstairs. Now, hurry up, man! Make sure you get some Filas, homie. -Come on, hurry the fuck up. -Come on, let's go, let's go! Yo! Tyrone, what the fuck you doing, man? Damn, I'm going to prison! Get them lights off. All right, motherfuckers, where are you? Get your hands up! Don't shoot! Please don't shoot! I don't have any weapons on me, sir. Move front! Move front! Put your fucking hands up! Put your hands up! Get up, get up, get up! Get your hands up! Spread your fucking legs! Spread your legs and don't move! Is anybody else in here? Nah, son. You don't got to be like this. Oh, God! I got too much to do. Not like this. You got plans for me, God. Mom said you got plans for me. Mom said you got... Mom said you got plans for me. -James, wake up! -Baby, what? -Do you smell that? -What, baby? Smells like there's a fire on the other side of the building, baby. Baby, come on. Come to bed, all right? We've been up all night. There's nothing we can do about it. Come on, just come to bed. No. No. No. No. No, please. Ma'am, it's the police. You all right? Okay. Everybody needs to go back to their buildings and make sure their neighbors and everybody is all right. Please! Everybody go check if your family and your neighbors are okay. You two, come with me. Is everybody all right in there? Is everybody all right in there? You all right? Is everybody all right in there? I'm stopping by to see if everybody is okay! Ms. Germaine! It's... Ms. Germaine? It's Fatima. I'm just stopping by to see if everybody is okay! Ms. Germaine? Are you in here? Ms. Germaine! Ms. Germaine! Ms. Germaine! Oh, my God! Ms. Germaine! Ms. Germaine! Are you okay? Help! Ms. Germaine... Help! I need help in here! -What's up? -They got CJ, dawg. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Shit! What happened? -They stabbed CJ last night. -What? -ls he okay? -Nah. He died, yo. -Oh, God! I just saw him yesterday! -Oh, shit! I told him... I told him to go back inside because it was going to get dangerous. This is bullshit, son. My God. Man, son didn't even deserve to go out like that, man! He was going to school. He was doing his thing. Shit is fucked up, yo. I bet you this was somebody from outside the neighborhood. Ain't nobody that we know did this. Why would somebody want to hurt him? I don't fucking understand this! This doesn't make any sense! Damn, son, lights go out one motherfucking time, niggas don't know how to act. -One time! -What the fuck are you all doing! Why! Please tell me why y'all are killing your fucking own! He was going to make something out of his life! He represented you! He was one of our finest products and you shattered everything! I need backup right now! Why don't you go find out who killed my man? Stop harassing us! Why don't you do your job, man? Hitting the street isn't going to do us any good, Claudine, but make us hot and more pissed! -Okay... -Baby. Look, why don't you just lie down and take a nap. And I'm sure, by the time you wake up, the power will be back on and everything will be all right. What if it's not? You know? What if it doesn't come back on? Like, what the fuck are we going to do, James? How are we gonna eat? There's no food in that fridge that's gonna be good one more night. This doesn't make any sense. -Baby, where are you going? -I'm going to go lay down. Ms. Germaine! Ms. Germaine! -Ms. Germaine! You all right? -You all right? -You all right? -Ms. Germaine, you all right? God, have mercy! About time y'all got here. I called y'all damn near 40 minutes ago! What, y'all guys forgot about us down here in the hood? I'm going with her. I want to go with her. Hey, yo, what happened to Ms. Germaine? She went the whole night without any food or any insulin for her diabetes -and passed out. -What? -She going to be all right? -Yes, she's going to be all right, brother. She's going to be just fine. You know what I am saying? Ain't nothing new under the sun. They've done this to us before. It all comes back around 360 degrees, you know what I'm saying. Now it's our turn for our generation to sustain! -Yo, Tech. -Yes? I need you to get the word out in the neighborhood. Sorry, Fa. -No. -Listen, I'm not the one for this. I need people to know they got to take pictures of all the food that went bad in their home last night. -The City is liable, yo! -Fa, I'm out. That shit is politics as usual. That's what the fuck it is, man! -That's some bullshit! -You just figuring that out? There ain't no money down here, nobody got no money, nobody making no money, so why the fuck they gonna rush down here to turn the lights back on? -So it's about money? -What the fuck do you think it is? Could be some corporate tricks, you know. I wouldn't put nothing past them Enron motherfuckers. Wait, don't N-Ron live down the street? -Cam, come on. -Quit looking at me like that. There's a dude named N-Ron who lives up the block. -He don't spell it the same. -You're embarrassing me right now. Come on, Rick, take a walk with me, man. I'm rolling with y'all. Yo, this shit is survival of the fittest, dawg. -That's what I'm saying. -It's crazy out here. Keep going like they're going down in Washington, -this shit'll be like this every day. -Shit looks like a war zone. Hey, yo, man, word up. I'm gonna go get some water or something, man. It's hotter than Tahiti out in this motherfucker. Damn! Word up, I don't know about y'all, but I'm starting to get real vexed. They better turn this motherfucker on, so I can have some access to my fucking money. I'm hungry as hell, yo! This shit ain't even funny no more, man. It never was. -Any updates? -Nope. Just the same old broken promises. You're having cereal with that milk? What if it's spoiled, James? It tastes fine to me. It's a little warm, but it's all right, I guess. Nel, man, I'm saying we need to hop in your whip and get out this neighborhood or something. -Hell, no. You haven't been listening? -Listening to what? -All the gas stations closed. -What? Yeah. Let this shit last for two, three more days and all these cats you see out here flossing on the strip is gonna be assed out. This some old Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome in Brooklyn-style bullshit. -I'm preserving my gas, man. -It's not going to get that crazy, Nel. We'll see. Yeah, okay. How old is this fool, trying to call us out like this? He ain't talking about nothing. See, that's why I don't stay on no corner, man. They give me the wrong juice. Let me come inside. I'm sorry, sweetheart, I can't do that. -All right. -Let's do it. We do what we got to do. Hey, yo, what's up? Hey, yo, relax. Relax with that shit. Calm the fuck down. Relax with the shit, man, I got it under control, baby. Relax. Yo, yo, what's up? What's up, man? What's up? A salami and bacon, Osama. What's the deal, man? You still selling water by the gallons? -No. -No? -Only small ones, a dollar. -Small ones? But you gonna have to wait like everybody else. -No, I ain't waiting, dawg, man. -I understand. I don't take orders from motherfucking sand niggers, you know what I mean? You play that shit in the Middle East, this is Brooklyn, New York, baby. Next. No, on the real, son, you gotta chill the fuck out, son. I'm too hot for this bullshit. You've been bugging since yesterday. You gotta max that shit out, bro. For real. Now's the time to make yours, man. That's the same Harlsborough cat that drove by the store earlier, man. CJ don't have me feeling all this stuff out here right now. Bullshit. Word is bond... Damn, dawg, why in the fuck are you drilling me like that man? Excuse me? Hey, yo, what's up, man? You looking at me like you know me or something, man. Niggas don't know me over here, man. What's up, yo? There's no stores over on Harlsborough? Last time I checked, there were stores over on Harlsborough. Can't hear what you're saying, man. Come here, yo. No, no. Chill. Yeah, that's what up, man. What's up? Y'all should do your motherfucking job find them niggas that killed my man. -What's good with that? -We don't want no problem. If I was you, I'd keep my voice down. If you was me? This is my block! What's the problem man? You know me or something? -Yeah, I know you. -What's up, nigga? You know me? What's going on, man, what you gonna do? I'm gonna take that fucking gun! We got power, baby! We got power! We got power! Hey, yo, Ali, man... What y'all need? -Hey, Fatima. -Hey, Ali. It's crazy out there, huh? I guess your surprise evening was ruined last night. In more ways than you can imagine. I am sure you can make it up some other time. I'm afraid yesterday's blackout shed light in my apartment last night. Reggie and I are no longer together. Say word? I mean, for real? -I'm sorry to hear about that. -Really? I'm not. Take care, Ali. Fatima, wait. Listen. Maybe you and I can catch some spoken word sometime. You know, have dinner, get to know each other outside of this element. You asking me out? Yeah. I mean, I was respecting your boy, but if he did something stupid to lose a beautiful gem like yourself... I can't just sit back and let you get lost Or swept up in some deep sands Like a pestilence coming across the lands you've been looking for Okay, that's enough poetry. Wow, I never... I never thought about you like that, and it's a... -It's not you, you know what I'm saying? -No, I understand. We're cool and everything, but I just never... So I'll see you around. Hey, I hope you feel better. Okay. Okay? Call me. I'll do that. Bye, Ali. Yeah! Thank you, Allah. Thank you. -He better be here. -Yeah. Where... Oh, yeah. You're a day late! Well, George, I think this is it. Thank you for everything. Hey, you're welcome. You know, it's not every day I get company. You know, I've been thinking I'm gonna have to get these places renovated. I mean, I have to keep them updated just to keep the need for all these repairs down. What do you think? The tenants will be happy to hear that. They better be happy. I don't want them pestering my superintendent. Your hands are gonna be full with these renovations, right? That's true. That's true. George. Listen, you call me, all right? Keep me personally updated with everything, any time, any place. You call me directly. Any problems, all right? -I'll do that, sir, thanks. -Take care of yourself. You, too. Hey, boss, you all right? How did you make out last night? I'm fine. I'm just great, everything turned out great. I'm really sorry about that, you know. I mean, leaving you out here. You know, with all the power out, I had no way of reaching you, and then I thought it might be dangerous if I returned. You know, maybe you might have taken a cab or something. You thought I might have taken a cab or something? How the hell do you think I could have gotten a cab here last night? By holding my wallet up in the air? Flashing my ass? You know what? Never mind. Everything, Anthony, is just fine. -Don't worry about it, okay? -Okay. Okay, so how did it work out with George? Did you kick him out? No, actually, I didn't kick him out. I learned a great deal about George during the course of our evening last night, and I found out, in fact, that he is an asset to me, so he's staying. I am, however, contemplating firing you for deserting my ass here last night. Are we going to start some time this century? Or are you gonna plan to stay in this neighborhood for the rest of my life? Hey, George. -Hey, youngblood, how you been? -Good, I'm good. Better now, I guess. Now is it me, or does it suddenly feel just a little bit cooler now? I think it's you. Little man, come here, man. Hold up. When you gonna fix this dude's head up, man? I got you. I got you. Go ahead, man. I'm just playing with you. That shit is good! He make you look good! You jacked him up, but you ain't mean to. Power has officially been restored in NYC. With the exception of a few minor, sporadic incidents, reports indicate that there have been very few cases of looting, some fires, mostly as a result of burning candles. There's been few, if any, violent cases of attacks. New Yorkers, if anything, were helpful, supportive and were on their best behavior, proving that the will and the power of the people of this city cannot and will not be broken. I'm going to the corner store. Get some milk. Oh, God! My people! My people! Having fun. The lights are back on. You can go back to having fun now. You just missed a goddamn-near opportunity of your life! You spent time in the dark. Dark's a very special place, you know. You can see things. You can see things that you don't see out here with all the distracting bullshit. You see that true light. Stevie Wonder. Ray Charles. Helen Keller. They all saw something special in the dark. They got smart in the dark. What did you do? Little humpty-hump? Or steal something? Now the lights are back on, business as usual. Black out, black in, black in, black out, black out. You should find you a dark spot. We can learn something. Oh, God! We need a messiah. Somebody that can come and say to all the CJs in the world, "Lazarus, rise up and walk. " And wipe away all the tears from a million mothers' faces. Out here, business as usual. Everybody having a good time. Just another day in the ghetto. Just another day in Brooklyn.
