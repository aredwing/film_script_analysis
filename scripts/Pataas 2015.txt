Facebook, twitter, etc. What do we gain if we use technology? Mad thief! One person on facebook will say, I am flying to Chennai. It means he says he is flying to Chennai. - You land in his house over here. - Wow! Another person from twitter will say he is at Joy Alukas. - It means he says he is at gold shop. - Attend him over there. - Oh great! - Live a luxurious life as thieves. God bless you my children!

Hello, girl! You! Hey, girl! Hello! Beat you. Can't you hear when I am shouting? Oh... sorry. Your name. Kavya... nice name. Okay? Kalyan. - Bye. - Sir! Sir, those real estate people have started revolution on us. Where? Hello! We are worried with our own problems and try to solve them. Why is he bothering us? For the injustice that happened to you, as chairman... ...and vice-chairman,. we condemn it severely. If he continues settlements like this... ...then we should set up laundry shops in front of the land we sell. Remove ACP! Save real estate! Remove ACP! We will not get frightened of such warnings! Let any number of people come. We will finish them! Run Milkha run! Brother. What is this preaching of Gita early morning, sir? Turn behind and look at the van... ...in 360 degrees. What is this concept, sir? What will 108 do? It saves people who are in danger. It saved people who meet with accident. Whenever some incident occurs, it will reach on time and drop everyone on time. Our 801 is quite opposite to it. It will thrash any person who goes against our sir. It will kick the person who gives complaint. If anybody acts smart, it will come and pick up the person on time... ...but drops them at his will. What are these schemes? - Get inside! - No! Is it necessary to talk like that when the vehicle is close? It came out in flow. Sir, you became police by mistake. Otherwise you would have become PM with these schemes. Who will do and who will get it done? Everything is Lord Krishna's plan. You have thrashed us so why do you blame it on Krishna. Come! Come! Why did you do the same after telling me? It came out in flow. Sir, where else in the city these vehicles are being run? That ACP What is he in front of our influence... Where is he? 'Entire women are shivering out of fear.' No! They cannot even visit a shop and buy milk packet. Give one quarter brandy. Brandy! Whisky too! Gin! Beer! - Vodka! - Here. Thanks, dear. - What about soda? - I don't use. You said you will tell me about liquor smuggling if I give you alcohol, right? - Tell me! Tell me! - I will tell you, sister. Take breaking news. Why did the expression and tone change? News is important to us. You go ahead. Speak out! In the hands of this Yadagiri, a reporter from... ...TV5 will be raped brutally. Cameraman escaped! Raghu! Even my wife too never offered alcohol with romance? Rascal! Will you rape me after drinking my liquor? Hey! Whoever tills the land, they should get the crop... ...and whoever offers beer should sleep on bed. - You come! - Run! - Why did he become reverse like that? - Will he not do then? He would have bought his alcohol if you had given 100 rupees. You bought it, made the drink... ...and offered him romantically. So will he not commit rape? See how he is running like a gold medal winning athlete in Olympics? Who will save us now? - Our God! - Stop it, Reddy. Sir, because of your grace... ...I have shifted my Akruti to corporate school from colony school. Good. Duplex house in Madhapur. Good architecture. I gave advance too, sir. Very good. I-10 for mother, I-20 for father. I-pad for brother, I-phone for sister. Entire family has become I. Superb! But-- You are happy, right? Why are you nagging? Is it sufficient if we are happy? Shouldn't you be happy? If you too search a beautiful girl and love her. Keep quiet! No love for me. You will say like this now. If we make a Maniratnam's frame... ...a beautiful girl will come running from down to up. She is coming in real. Sir? - Sir! Greetings, sir. - Hey! What? What? - No! - I will thrash you! - Superb! - Did I do it well? Hey, come! Let us go. He left. Okay... okay. If you offer liquor to every person like this. What is it, Reddy? Background looks black and white but girl is seen in colour. Has your heart beat increased? Has your entire body become cold? Almost the same. So you had fallen in love, sir. - Oh! - Yes. We have to focus on that girl. How will you do, sir? She is from press and you from police! - Let us keep a press meet. - Oh! - Have all channels come? - Yes, sir. TV 9, ETV 2... ...NTV... where is our channel? Where is this fan effect coming from? - Mr. Reddy. - Sir, I am your fan. First tell us why did you keep this press meet? Is it about the murders happening in city? Is it about illegal activities? - Is it about drugs racket? - Robbery? - Child labour? - Rapes? Mr. Reddy, these men sitting in front are torturing me. - See them. - Why don't you say? We will tell you? Will we not tell after calling for press meet? All men go back and women come in front. What is this concept? RTC bus concept! Mr. Reddy... Tell me. Why did you call for press meet? Do you always wear jeans and t-shirts? Do you wear saris too anytime? What is your domination on our girl? Take her to your house after marriage and make her wear whatever you want. - Oh? - Yes. Why did you call for press meet? Will you resign from job after marriage? What is the need for her? You are a man and earning well. - Oh? - Yes. Hello... is it a personal meet or press meet? Are we not from TV channel? Don't we have mikes? Will you not talk to us? Where is this coming from? It will not look good if we make press people is tin vehicle. Say something and send them. Sweet boy... please. Okay. My dear media friends. Take my statement. Yesterday in Chattisgarh, our police constable Parmesh... ...has loved a reporter Rita and married her. This is news and there should be press meet for this! What does sir intend to say is... ...by getting inspired from Chattisgarh incident... ...he too wishes to marry a lady journalist. Press and police combination looks crazy. If anybody from you is interested... ...then you may submit applications, sir will look into them. Not interested! Try in Chattisgarh. What is it with your girl? Why is she talking so harshly? Will she talk smoothly in the first meet? Wait for two, three meetings. - Oh. - Yes. Isn't it? Hello! Don't ever keep these press meets for giving such stupid news. Our time is wasted! He is getting irritated on small matters. Small small things. - Mr. Reddy, focus on them. - We will do it very well. Sir, instead of waiting for that ACP... ...if we do dieting then at least belly will reduce. Start the meeting, sir. This meeting is for him. What should we do if he is not present? Let him come. Anyways ACP. What are you doing here? Land dealing with DGP? Yes... What is it? Didn't we come to complaint against him? It seems one vehicle is behind us like satellite. Which vehicle? Sir, you please do your work. We will do our work. - What work? - Come, I will tell you. - Where? - Thai massage. - How much? - Free! - So first for me! - Enter inside. ACP is coming! Sir. He is the king of Mysore! Tell him to come. - He has come. - Why are you so late? What should I do, sir? He said 30, I said 20. Finally settled at 25. Have you seen it? He is talking about settlements in front of you. Why do you say settlements, sir? I am talking about rupees. Do you know how the prices of vegetables are increasing? What is the cost of tomatoes? - Will you please sit down? - Sure, sir. Tell me your complaints. What should I tell you, sir? Real estate business, partnership with thieves. What are those schemes and nuisance? Sir, we are filing cases and he is doing settlements. Sir, people like him shouldn't be there in department. Suspend him, sir! Is it so easy to suspend an IPS? Committee should come from central, they should conduct inquiry. Evidences, witnesses. Sir, has anyone given a written complaint on me? How will we give? There are 801 vehicles and some song. Nobody knows where they are coming from and where they are going. Okay. Will zonal officers working with me... ...will anybody testify against me - Ask our DGP Rangarao? - Sir, how is i-20 car? It is giving 18 per litre. How does he know that you have i-20? He has given it. Or else ask our ACP Venkat Reddy. - Where is he? - I am here. Hello... hope you liked your new house. What? House? When is the house warming ceremony? We are planning on 25th. I will come to the office and give the card tomorrow. It is okay... it is okay. In fact we all have come to an understanding... ...and are working together with honesty and sincerity. - What? Working? - Sir, I mean. While we are working... - ...what are these meetings for. - Sir! Sir, our lives have seen light only after this God came. - Hey. - Lord! Please! Please! Please by keeping this kind of time wasting meetings... ...don't waste time for being a DGP. By the way, who is he? If the three lions stand for honesty, sincerity and justice... ...the fourth lion that is not seen. Agni! Yes. Fire! Bye, sir. He has come to this city with a different intention. GK! Good morning. Come, Home. - Subba Reddy. - Sir. Wait. Is it the plate from which GK sir has eaten? Yes, sir. What is that greed? If you ask then they will give another plate. Raja, it is not that there are no more idlis in this house... ...or that I don't have money. It is to symbolically say that we all are living by eating GK's leftover food. Uncle, call from Bhanumathi. Should I send Qualis or Innova? Hell with her! She is not taking my call. Is she in touch with you? Tell him. Tell him the entire personal matters. - Hi, Chevibothu uncle! - Hi, Nani. See there once. Hey, what are you doing on roads at midnight after drinking? On police uniform. Hey! Did you beat police? Raja, why do you feel so happy as if he secured a state rank? DGP has filed the case. I have settled the matter. Make our boy-- Tell me so that I understand! Raja, make our boy say sorry to police. We gave him minister's post by licking everyone's feet at centre. So why does he tell us to say sorry instead of doing favour to us? "Even if we make a dog sit on golden throne..." "...it will still behave like a dog!" What is the confusion? Sumathi or Bhanumathi? - You! - No! Brother is MP and uncle is Home Minister! Boys committed some mistake so instead of covering it... ...why do you complicate it. Is this the assurance that you give to our future generations? Phone... phone... give the phone... - I will get him sacked! - Raja, wait. Will you get me sacked? Will you really do it? Am I such a fool? Cannot I save my post? - Raja and Nani! Beat me! - Uncle. Beat me! Beat me! Beat me! GK, your brother beat Home Minister. Will a person who beats the Home Minister cannot a beat policeman? Is it a big case? Should we take tension for it? Am I not there who eats your leftover? Shall I talk to the DGP? - Tell me, sir. - Last night our policemen... ...have thrashed our boys after drinking heavily. Just now I have learnt about it. Suspend them for two weeks. Sir, it is-- Suspend them! They will sit at home and take rest with wife and children! DGP. My dream is to see my brother as a political leader. If anybody comes in between, I will get hurt. Better luck next time. Small doubt. Raja, why are you so much angry with policemen? Why is a cat angry on rat? Why is a tiger angry on deer? They will hunt them and satisfy their hunger. Nature instinct. It is related to nature... ...and also a nature behaviour. I hate police. What shall we do now, Reddy? If we raid some rave party then... ...we will pay our chit fund money with the money we get there. Stop it, Reddy. You have become very commercial. See how romantic the climate is. I want my darling. How will you meet your darling right now? We will call for press meet. What will you call press meet for at 12 o'clock midnight? Two thieves are caught red-handed while stealing inside the ATP. From where will two thieves come right now? Hello! We are still making rounds of Apollo for the pains from your 801 thrashing. Sir, our lives will get ruined if you now talk about thieves and press meets. Reddy, motivate them a little. Are they writing entrance exam so that we motive them? They are going to central jail. Is it okay if we put masks? What masks? Call the press! Sir, how did the robbery happen in ATM? Hey, why are you rushing to him? What do you want to know? Go away! Only those channel people should speak. - Come, madam. - You come. Sir, how come there is so much change in them? It is nothing. Our 801 went around in their area for one hour yesterday. They have crushed like flour. Brother-in-law, vehicle is taking press people too. Remove the masks of thieves. Why should we remove the masks, madam. You leave out people involved in big scams... ...but will you catch us for committing small thefts. - Yes. - Why don't you talk, brother-in-law? What should I talk? There are cameras. My God! I don't know anything! How much amount is stolen from ATM? Yes, Reddy? Why is your girl so irritating? Will she not be like that? Her job is like that. She has many tensions. - Oh? - Yes! I know you are trying for me. However you may try, I will not fall for you. What is it with your girl? How can she not co-operate little bit? - How will I know the details? - Why will she tell them. You are a police officer. Use your brain and know them. - Oh? - Yes! Last night we caught a thief, right? Who? The one who stole one kilogram gold? Give half kilogram from it to this fatty. Flat number four, house number 104. Dilsukhnagar, Hyderabad. Only her sister and brother-in-law stay in her house. Her sister is mad and passionate about police. That's why they got her married to a big businessman... ...by lying to her saying he is police. There she said she will live with him... ...only if he wears uniform on Saturdays on Sundays. If you go to their house then she will get you married to her. Sir, my gold. Thief is caught but not the gold. Mr. Reddy. What is our immediate action? Well, it will be beneficial if we go for her elder sister by leaving her. Well said, Reddy! Well said! Mahi! Darling Mahi! - Where are you, dear? - Who are you? I love your sister. How dare you! Do you love my sister? - Sir is ACP! - Brother-in-law? Come. Come. Sit. Sister-in-law, nasty furniture in this costly house? - Mr. Reddy! - We will change it. Old TV in a modern showcase? Change it! Change it! Why is your beautiful neck empty? Brother-in-law, we have another house in Langer house. - That doesn't fall under our area. - It is okay. Brother-in-law, first you sit. I should give treat you well. What will you take? Coffee? Tea? Cold drink? Dear! Yes, Kantham? Don't you face problems if you go out in uniform like this? Why will I not face problems? Recently I went to forests for eat forest food... ...maoists attacked me. Kantham, it is very hot in the kitchen. Should I remove the dress? Sacred thread is heavy. Should I remove it? Sister, pack the lunch box soon. Sister, why did he come home directly? - Hey, go away from here! - Keep quiet. Brother-in-law came home for the first time? Why do you tell him to go out? - Go and talk to her for some time. - Ah! Come! Come! - What is this, sister? - Wrong, bujji. Why should I talk to a stranger? - I understood. - What is this? - Click! - Do you have any sense? - Selfie! - Hey! What the hell! This pose is good! Go out I say! Otherwise I will do a live show in our channel by saying... ...you are harassing me and get you thrashed. - Sister-in-law. - Wait, brother-in-law. What will you do? You have only one channel? There are 20 channels against you. Brother-in-law and I will sit on live show and you have pinched him... ...bit him... ...and touched him. What will you do? Sister. Sister-in-law, I want to go to restaurant with your sister. - Take her. - She will not come with me. She will come with family. Will you eat burger? Sister, when there so many chairs empty in front... ...so why should we sit close and tight like this. It will be good if we all sit and eat other. It will not look good if we sit far away and eat. - Yes, brother-in-law? - Yes. Well said. Come home. I will see you. Police uncle, autograph. Tell one dialogue too. Policeman will go to police station... ...and not to post office if he gets transferred. Mother! Hi, friends! Now we are announcing... ...'Most Visiting Best Couple of the year' goes to... ...Mr. Kalyan and Mahathi! How come I am most visiting? I came here for the first time. Yes! Yes! Clap for them! Hey! - She is going. - Mahi! "Oh my oh my baby! Don't leave me and go!" ""Oh my oh my baby! Just smile and give me a look." Though so much poetry came out with deep feeling... ...she didn't even turn back and see. Thanks, Reddy. "Hey, girl! Don't make faces." "Don't hurt my live, don't burn my heart." "Hey, girl! Don't snub me." "Don't get irritated, don't turn your eyes red." "Show me a teaspoonful of sympathy. Share fistful of love." "Put a basketful of love in my account." "Millimeter length of smile is enough." "Centimeter length of smile is enough." "We should reduce the miles of distance between you and me." "I will give you flowers, I will worship you. I beg you. Love me." "I will give you money, I will treat you as a queen. I beg you. Love me." "Like the kohl in your eyes, I will read your entire dreams." "I will remain like the sound of your bangles." "I will tell you sweet things by becoming your earlobes." "I will become betel leaves on your lips and share the sweetness." "I will draw your photo like a dream, I will guard you like a fence." "I will make our story special from others." "I will remain like a tattoo, I will become the promise." "I will make you walk by becoming your toe ring." "I will give you flowers, I will worship you. I beg you. Love me." Sir, she felt shy. It means she had given the signal. Yes, girl? "I will become the rain of love in summer for you." "I will become the warmth hug in this cold." "I will become the first ray of light at dawn and wake up." "I will come as moonlight for you in dark." "I will hear you before you call me, I will be seen before you think of me." "I will become love to your unseen life." "If there a is sound for a heartbeat." "I will become breathe to your wishes." "I will give you flowers, I will worship you. I beg you. Love me." "I will give you money, I will treat you as a queen. I beg you. Love me." About that ACP-- Hi, DGP. If there is TV near you then turn it on. The GK complex having many litigations... ...is finally opened morning. Police tried to stop its construction but it has done the opening. GK sir is a very good human being. I wish he constructs many malls like this. He will always enjoy my support. ACP met me today morning and told me to give sweet news to you. ACP is not a stranger. He is your real son. Whatever move you make from now... ...I will give you counter with your son. Good afternoon, DGP sir. - Take sweets, sir. - Why? GK sir's mall is opened. Sir, there is a new enthusiasm in the department... ...after knowing that DGP sir is your father. - Oh? - Yes! But why is sir looking dull. Sir, take care of your health. You will hear many such sweet news from now. Bye, sir. Sir, we traced his records. He changed his name to Kalyan school and studied... ...in an orphan school in Uttar Pradesh. His childhood photo is coming through fax. See that star! There! There! See how many colours are there! - Mother, will father come? - Yes, son. Yes, sister? Didn't sir come home yet? Is he working on festivals too? We too are doing jobs and are happily spending time with children. As if he alone is serving the country! - Come early in the morning. - Okay, sir. Why didn't you bring crackers to the boy? Oh! Sorry, dear. Shall we go and buy now? - I don't want! - Son! Mother! Father is like a friend or guide to son. But for me, he remained like a photo in album... ...and signature in progress card. Only mother would stay with me in both happiness and sadness. So, you study. I will be back soon. - Oh! - What happened, mother? What happened, mother? That squad--- Father! Father! Mother fell down. We need to take her to hospital immediately. Come soon, father. Please, father. Sir, situation is very serious there. We should go immediately. - Gurunatham. - Sir. - My wife is undergoing pains. - Sir. Take her to the hospital urgently. - You go with the boy. - Okay, sir. - I will come in half an hour. - Okay, sir! Come on! Move! Get in! Ah! Mother! Mother! Condition is very critical.

I hate your attitude! I am a journalist. There is no need for the man who marries me to be great. It is sufficient if he is not like you. You must be aware that a software engineer got murdered in the city. We identified a number plate from the place where the murder took place. That number plate is registered in your brother's name with your address. So you both come to the station once. Yes, Brownie! Why are you barking? Don't you know how to behave in front of elders? It seems it has become very arrogant. If we keep her inside the cage and thrash... ...for few days then it will become fine. GK sir, you filed a complaint saying your car is lost. It is found in old city, sir. I worked hard and found the car but number plate is missing. Hey, number plate is found by DGP sir. Really? Where is it? Give the number plate. AP9Z 4737. Hey, it is the same. GK sir, your work is done. And my payment-- If you give the statement then I will leave. Will you tell me to come to station? When a policeman lowers his head in front of me... ...the blood in my body runs with high voltage. I feel very good! I hate police. Sir, this is just sample. You will see a lot in coming days. Morning, Mr. Kashi. Why did sir tell me to come urgently? Do you know how big mistake you are committing? Keep quiet, Mr. Kashi. Why do you talk irritatingly like him saying right and wrong? He doesn't care for his wife and children except duty. Listen to me and you too get released from him soon. Sir, make some money before you retire. Do you know who these people are? They are not politicians who does scams or criminals who commit crimes? They are the most respectable police officers... ...who laid down their lives for the country. Policemen who lets off a bike if you give 500 rupees to them... ...and policemen who strikes off the case if you give 1000 rupees. They are found one in every street. But in spite of knowing they are going to die... ...they join the police and sacrifice their lives... ...are one in thousands. It is sufficient... ...if you live like him for one day, one minute and one second. There is a heart behind every police badge. This heart has mother, father, sister, wife, children and all relationships. By overcoming all of them and by turning his heart into stone... ...these policemen have move ahead by considering their duty as life. Every day before leaving for duty, I am proudly await... ...when will I join these photos. What did you say? Don't I care for wife and children even when they are dying? Because of my not coming to your mother that day... ...I could save lot of mothers and children over there. You must have faced loss... ...but many people over there got justice. Mother! I will act with honesty, courtesy and regard for the welfare of others... ...and will endeavour to develop these sprit of the cops... ...for every policeman who took this vow... ...duty first, family next. But you are supporting that GK because of your anger on me. Do you know this is the case of a girl's murder? Do you know who the girl that died is? Do you know who killed her? Do you know how they killed? Who are you? Leave me! Where will you run? Stop! Hey, who is it? Leave her! Hey! Kavya! What happened, dear? Kavya... Get up, Kavya. Hey! You! No! Girl is missed! You have disturbed the entire mood! Kill her! Kill her! After Kavya's father came out of come and told the truth... ...we came to know that it is Kava who died. These days we think why should we care when injustice occurs on roads... ...but in spite of being handicapped... ...she died in the hands of those scoundrels while trying to save a girl. GK is trying to save his brother with his power. Shall we leave the rascal? It is okay if you don't accept me as father... ...but don't know whether you do justice to the girl as brother... ...you only decide it. Good evening everybody. Software engineer didn't die in this case. A special girl by name Kavya. Children of bigwigs are behind it. I will not spare anyone in spite of any pressure. I will arrest everyone. Our department took this case with great challenge. We need your media support too. We are taking action based on the complaint given by Kavya's father. We will close this case very soon. - Sir, they are killing me. - Srikanth, let's move. Sir... sir... sir. Sir, they are killing me. Save me, sir. Hey! Why did you hide behind him? Do you think he is police? He comes running like a dog if I show him a hundred rupees note. Come and take this 100 and leave him. He seems to be feeling inhibition. Go and drag the old man. 'ACP Kalyan on duty!' Brother, ACP is killing me. Brother. - ACP Kalyan! - Oh! Sir has changed! I will trample sincere officers. You will trample them if they are sincere from beginning But if a eccentric person like me turns sincere then... ...he will bury you alive! Bloody fool! Hey! You cannot tolerate the speed with which I come! My route is not highway so that you will come in speed. Hard road! You will die if speed becomes more. - Hey, you don't know about me. - No need! My blood boils if you tell about bio-datas. Today is the last happiest day to you and your brother in life. Eat your favourite food, drink your favourite brand and sleep peacefully. From tomorrow, cases, arrests, protests... ...roadblocks all throughout the day. You will go mad! It is fun for you to play with police, right? A right policeman has entered your life. Come! Let us play! Tell me, Reddy. Bail is brought to get GK's men released. Hey! For how long should we wait. Sir, bail papers. This is the way to ask for bail. - Reddy. - Sir. Leave them. Come. Come.

I will get him transferred from here in 30 minutes. What is the problem with both father and son? My brother had killed that dumb girl with his friends. If you were to prove it... ...courts, witness, judgments, postponing... it is a big process. I will take my brother in this gap... ...and make him sit in parliament. Do you know what a politician is? Do you know what a politician is? Politician means king. He makes hundreds of policemen like you salute him. Politician means leader. What we say is final. Public is behind us. Politician is magician. Magic. He will perform magic. Chevipoku, he shouldn't go anywhere. He should be here only. I should play with him. Hey, ACP. I am giving you one week's time. If you have guts then bring my brother and put him in jail. One week. Try it. One week is too long. Three days are enough. GK. You said you want to see a policeman... ...who stands in front of you and twirls his moustache. My son has come. - Well done. - Thank you, sir. Sister, this is uncle's office. How come there is so much change in you? - There is a change in him. - Oh! Come. The only evidence we have in this case is that software girl. Sir, she left Hyderabad out of fear after the issue happened. Try from all possible angles. At any cost, we have to trace her. It is a great thing for me to come here because of my height. So promotion is difficult now. Where is DGP sir's room? - He is in meeting? - So ACP sir? He too is in meeting, It is not possible to meet. Anyway, it is okay, brother-in-law... - Sister, waiting is not possible by me. - Give the phone. Hello, I came to uncle DGP's office. We thought of talking about promotions, right? - Madam!

Father and son met with great difficulty. What will he think if you talk of sister and marriage? Take some gap, find his mood and tell him this matter. I am sorry if I disturbed you. Now you look like the person whom I want to marry should look like. You are fighting for justice in Kavya's case.,. ...and I feel proud as a girl for it.

But ACP sir came and encouraged me so... ...I came out and I am telling the truth. Sir, hang them in the middle of the road. Brother, what is there to feel shock in it? Since she was the witness so we thought of getting her married to him. Now she is the witness so let her get married to him. True! Look how good the couple looks like a bollywood hero and heroine.

Do you know it is a big crime... - ...to fire bullets in an MP's house? - Brother... ...do you want logic in spite of all these happenings? Mr. Reddy. Our sir came to arrest here... ...and because of GK's men attacking him... ...ACP sir behaved very intelligently... ...and have fired one bullet on leg and two bullets in air. - Oh? - Yes. Why does he get fired by asking for it? Non-bailable warrant. Top most doctors in the city. Tell me, doctors. Unable to tolerate the allegations leveled against him... ...he suffered high BP.

I will say bye and go. - Brother... brother. - Brother. What did you say? Politician is king and trash. Should I tell you what a police is? Police means power! Its impact will be like that. Police is fear! It is like this. Police is arrogance! It is like me. This street dog killed a girl brutally... ...and I will not spare him until I get him death sentence. I am taking your brother to station on time as I said. I give you too three days time. Whether you use money, men, or hold legs or collars... ...or seek recommendations or influence... rascal! Do whatever you can! If you have guts then get your brother released from station. Come! GK, generally every person has one teaspoonful of temper. And the guy who wears this dress will have it in tons. What, sir? Why did you arrange such a big party suddenly? My son has shown the power of police to GK. How come we don't celebrate it? This is for my son. - Cheers! - Cheers! Kantham, I told you that real police don't attend... ...parties in uniform. Did you listen to me? It is okay. They will think that you came directly from station. Yes, sir? It seems you are coming directly from station. Didn't I tell you? Come. Girl. Why is she coming like that? Yes? I wore sari with great difficulty. Why don't you make a comment or like? Mr. Reddy, her sari is nice, isn't it? Hey, why do you tell him? You said to give a comment or like. - Therefore I directly shared it. - Oh! Okay. Now I will go and share our matter with your dad directly. - Hey... hey, Mahi! - Excuse me, sir. - You-- - TV reporter. Oh! I am travelling with your son in Kavya's case. Good. My son should always have your support. These are common between wife and husband. What? Her feeling is that press and reporter are like wife and husband. - You come. - Say one dialogue. Do you think I am a coward to fear if you scare me? Police! Excuse me... you-- My husband. You said her husband is producer of serial. Sir, that is side business. This is profession. He is not a police at all. My husband is police. If he is police then why did you file complain with us. It is... sir, his zone is different. - Which zone? - East coast. Why is he telling the train's name when I am asking the name of zone? Sir, he got confused. Eat zone. What is your designation? Why do you ask me? You must have fixed to something. You tell him. DCP. East zone DCP. I am DCP of east zone. Hello, mister. Where did they transfer me to? Who knows? Who knows? Sambar is over there! Go! Ask in inquiry. Be careful, father. Thanks a lot. When your needed the father... ...I was not by your side. But when I needed the son... ...you are next to me. I am sorry. No, father. I have understood your value... ...and the value of this uniform. Brother-in-law, mason Raju is online. He says to cover these holes with cement. What I said was, we will stick a colour paper... ...and so the light coming from out will be colourful. What do you say? Public is laughing at us. Do you hear? Can you hear the laughing? Brother-in-law, ladies are laughing a lot. I am thinking how to get my brother released. Should it be covered with cement? Should we stick a paper? - Are all these necessary? - What shall we do now? Youth will not remain silent... ...when youth leader is inside. Provoke all the students' unions that are under our control. City should be held to ransom. Release our leader! Break them! Mr. Reddy. My dear students! Please vacate this place and go. All of you have a good future. Don't ruin your lives by following GK's words. What will you teach us about our future? If GK's brother is not released within half an hour... ...city will be set on fire. We will commit suicide and die if you don't release our GK's brother. I will climb the cell tower and die by jumping from there. - Police! - Go Back! - Police! - Go Back! - Police! - Go Back! - Police! - Go Back! - Police! - Reddy! Move. Why did you arrest us, sir? Did you think how humiliating it is for us? What mistake did we commit, sir? If citizens commit mistake then it is the mistake of police. If students commit mistake then it is the mistake of teachers. If children commit mistake then it is the mistake of parents. - Our children-- - Wait! Our children are going to school and studying well. What mistake did they commit? - Are they going to school and studying? - Watch it live! GK is like my father. So who am I? There will be no college, exams and studies until GK's brother is released. I swear on my mother and say... ...we will not move from here until we see happiness in the eyes of GK sir. What?

No student should talk of strikes from now! Sir, everything is clear. Thanks, mother. - Hello. - How is the live telecast, brother GK? You still have two days time. All the best. Brother, police has hidden the eunuch somewhere. No! "He is totally mass!" "He is total class!" "He is the hope of box. He is a cracker!" "Look at this police! He is a bursting cracker." "He is the cracker that ends up everything illegal!" Listen-- Brother-in-law, Bhanumathi has uploaded a photo on face... ...and she says you didn't like it. - She is scolding badly. - Hey! - Gk! - Hail! - Release GK's brother! - Oh! Henceforth 801... Challa brothers' 801. Transfer like GVK 108. Remove the tent. - What if we don't remove it. - Play the audio. Fruit looks nice from outside. There are insects inside if you cut it and see. Is this the glass in which you drank? One man show in the entire city! ACP Kalyan has become the real hero for public and police. ACP Kalyan has stood by girl and has become a hero for public. "He is total mass." ACP Kalyan sir is really very great. "He is the hope of box. He is a cracker." - He has showed what police power is. - "Look Police man." "He is a bursting cracker." - GK should be removed from the post. - GK should resign. - We support Kalyan! - We support Kalyan! Brother-in-law, they say Nani will be hanged for sure. So if you transfer the properties from his name to my name... ...you will be safe. Registrar is online. Entire body got injured due to ACP's thrashing. Don't pierce it with a needle! Hello. Registrar sir, my uncle is not interested. - Get in touch after Nani dies. - No! My sister gave you to me while she died so. Uncle. So I am sparing you without killing you. - Uncle. - Raja! GK Raja! It is finished! Case has become public. Situation went out of control. If you can-- Chevipoku, tell me so that I can understand. Matter is known at the centre. Your post is lost! Did you come to tell this matter? Disloyal dog! No! No! Am I a disloyal dog? Hey, brother Nani beat the police and they have come home... ...so let us say sorry... What did you say when I told this? Will you humiliate me by calling me dog? Anyway, I still tolerated it. Our boy is harassing girls. ...so I told you to warn him a bit. You said it is okay. You still humiliated me. I tolerated it. Finally I said I will transfer the ACP. You said not to do it. You said he should be here and you will play football. Are you Olympic player to play football? I will tell you Sumathi's poem. Hear it, rascal! 14th page, 6th chapter. 3rd poem. A strong man says he will not fear anything... ...and gets bitten... ...by ants and die. He finally dies! You will die the same death. I used to drink... ...your leftover drinks. I still used to eat your leftover food. Try to understand and become good. Rascal! Brother, we found the eunuch's address. - Listen to me, Mahi. - I will not listen. I will tell your dad today and fix our marriage. - Why don't you wait for few more days? - No possible. Hello, girl. - Hello, uncle. - Come, dear. You came at the correct time. There is good breaking news. Watch it. - What is it? - I am planning to get my son married. Nice decision. With whom, uncle? Our Kashi's daughter. I am not related to it. What does your daughter-in-law do, sir? Software job in America. - Oh? - Yes! Mr. Raghu, keep the camera in front of Kashi sir. He is ruining the life of a reporter for the sake of his own daughter-- Commissioner Kashi Vishwanath. Commissioner joined hands with SI Reddy and... ...is involved in liquor business, drugs mafia, human trafficking... - ...land grabbing-- - Hey, stop it. Madam, don't spoil my career. He said it for fun. Yes? "Will you fix the bed, I will give you Bandaru sweets?" "I will buy you sari and blouse, will you come to the fields?" "We are young, hot and enthusiastic." "Let us love, oh my queen." "Hey Rambha!" "Rambo has come." "I will not melt down like others." "I will give you a slip if you play tricks, rowdy SI." "We are young, hot and enthusiastic. "But still I will not fall for you, dear." 'Hey, Samba." "Rambhahas come." "Oh smart girl!" "Oh smart girl!" "Don't provoke me, dear." "I will shake, move..." "...and rein you." "Whatever you do..." "...I will not be caught." "Entire town will see..." "...don't trap me." "I will give you various gifts, if you hug you if you fall in my arms." "Listen to me and come, oh queen." "This is the tribute to Balaiah!" "By showing batons--" "By showing batons..." "...don't threaten me, oh hero." "If you love..." "...come to me sincerely." "Colourful babe!" "Let us find a place." "Your love and my love." "Let us make it hot." "There is sweet, spicy and sour." "Why should we make it late? Come, oh dear." Sir, I will present the witness in the court by tomorrow morning 10 o'clock. Good. Sir! Kalyan! Hey! Mahi! Sir! You follow Mahi! I will go this side. Mahi, are you okay? Don't feel happy that your girl friend is found. I have kept you far away from my coverage area wantonly. It is a trap. I too will get my brother released on time... ...by breaking your hands and legs. The eunuch who is the witness in this case... ...and your father who supports you... I am killing them both. - Hey! - Hey, don't waste time. Moreover you are at a long distance. Come... come... come. Hey, it seems dad too has come. Come and collect the body. Move! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Save me, sir! - Sir! - Sir! Reddy, father is not taking the call. Trace his number and identify the location urgently! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Ramesh, don't shoot! Sir! Save me, sir! Sir! Sir! No! Sir! Sir! - Hey! - Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sincere police will get suspended... ...or die. Your son too will join you in sometime. Hey, mad. My son is following law and order and others rules because I am there. The moment I don't exist, he will break the rules. He will... ...kill you. You death in my son's hands... ...will be col. Father... father. As an Home Minister, I would always tell DGP that... ...you are in the hit list of terrorists, so be careful. I will tell only one word on DGP. All the deceased people are good. Jai Hind! As expected by everyone, GK's brother and his friends are released on bail. - Srujan! D6 news. - Hail! Nani! Sir, the three accused in Kavya's case got released bail. Reddy, I think the train is on time. Sir, Falaknuma is late by 15 minutes on this track. Repalle passenger is on right time on that track. Shift to that track. "Train is coming. Her style is wonderful." Sir! Passenger might apply brakes. Yes, sir. Shatabdi and non-stop don't have brakes there. Shift! Why do you shout like that when train is coming? Come! If you have TV nearby then turn it on. GK's partner Ravi and his son... ...have died in a train accident today morning. While crossing the track for toilet... ...sources say they had been hit by the train. Only three hours. You are finished. Reddy, is the lorry ready? Sir, even the garland is ready to put. Leave me! Leave me! Sit! Sit! Now let us what the witness says. Come. Did you see the accident live? I saw it half an hour back. How is it? I have seen both father and son drinking brandy on roadside hotel. And then? I don't drink more than a quarter. Will you come on highway by drinking full? How dare you are! Finally what do you say? Public! Don't drink and drive! Second wicket too is out! How can he drink and drive? He doesn't have the habit of drinking. ACP is diverting the topic with these killings. Tamanna is coming! Now you want to hear from the witness, right? Yes! - Sir, you are-- - MS Taman. Taman is my fan. Public-- Nobody comes when asked to vote. Will you come in huge numbers when it is Tamanna? What is this? Where are you going? Look at him! He died in trampling. Its paining. From the bottom of my heart... ...begging... let Tamanna's fans stay alive. She is so sensitive. Yes. What is the mystery behind these serial killings? Sir, not only the police... ...maoists kill politicians too. Logic! Press people have come. What should I tell them? You know it very well. All the deceased are good. People who are alive, are sweet memories of deceased people. Hope you don't put me in those sweet memories. It depends on your performance. I will perform very well! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! What is this? Are you journalists? Let anything happen to our face but news is important to you. Ask me! They are saying police is behind these sequel murders. These are natural deaths. So do you support them? Are you trying to hide the truth? Are you afraid of the pressure? Media friends... ...whenever I undergo frustration these days... ...I am using an item for mental peace. Entire state knows it. - Do you know? - What is it, sir? - What is it, sir? - What is it, sir? Jai... thanks for your pepper spray. Hey, ACP! I know I am your next target. Everyone related to Kavya's case... ...is dying one after another so I have... ...brought high security from government. Security officer too is sincere like you. Cop who doesn't comprise. I will be in Delhi in next hour. I will return with the power that I lost. I will teach you a lesson! - At what time is the flight? - 10 o'clock. - Uncle-- - My words... hey! Do you want to trace my location by making me talk? Oh... I think airport too has come. Nani and I kept telling you that route is changed. Did you listen? Cop who doesn't compromise. You followed the profile very well. Have you seen the photo? See there once. I hate police! For your security... ...there was a bumper offer in the department yesterday. Everyone got ready... ...but I won the lottery. I am in my safety. What is your-- Our blood has one bad habit. Whoever the person might be in front of us, we just confront him directly. Eye to eye! Face to face! We don't backstab like you. Your brothers deaths are decided. Hey! Hey! Hey! - Hi! - You-- Tsunami star Subash! I am the witness to your death too. - I will not spare you. - Hi, you are crying. Sir, once I want to hear him say I love police. Not just once... ...I will say it hundred times. I love police! I love police! But I hate criminals. Aim the guns! Fire! Eye witness is next to us. There-- Who are you, sir? Vish! Oh! Tsunami star? You? What happened to this city? On one hand there is river Musi and on the other hand it is smoke. We cannot avoid paying heavy penalty. Movies have become less, so he came to ads. - He has become old. - Shut up! I started like that for content connectivity. I came here because the climax location is tempting. By then Gk came here to hide these mills. He said hi and offered a cigarette. I said I don't have the habit and told him to get out. He got fired when I looked at him. You will die in installments if you smoke at smoking zone. If you smoke at no smoking zones then you will die instantly. Public! Please have awareness! In how many getups should I say? - Sir-- - I know. To how many people should I say? Will you not listen? Will you not change? Hello! Wait. - There is a small information. - Two states. Two 801. Two Chandras. They are telling to implement. There is a toll free number too. Audio is very powerful than video here. Prawn and Crab production! Missile! Ready to launch! Opening shot! Police means power! Police means arrogance! Police means fear! This is not enough. Very good. Very good. Congrats, sir. Why are you not clapping? Sir, why do you play police at the age if dying? Shut up! You wondered when Rajini did 'Robo' at this age. So will you not watch Subash's 'Missile'? - How can you compare with him? - Pack up! - Which forest is it? - Chattisgarh. As if you didn't find any minister in the country... ...you have kidnapped only me. Call the Prime Minister and tell him... ...to change my port folio. Tell it is the demand of kidnappers. - Whom are you calling? - Home Minister. Rascal! The person who saved us... ...call him. Even if we get kidnapped in South African forests... ...he should come and save us. Cut it!
