No, that's not marble. It's the bone foot of an ostrich. And this is Walnut. It's only found in San Luis. A special kind of tree. - Only in San Luis? - Yes, in the province. My relatives who work there sent it to me. - A hard wood. - Very. It's extraordinary. A very nice souvenir, that's why I am offering it. This is a very rare wood. It's from a shipwreck back in 1800. - Really? - I picked it up from the coast. This handle is historic. How much is it? Because of the work it demands, $100. - $100?! - You've got to work your ass off... to earn that money here. If I had $100, I wouldn't be working here. Too much money! I'll give it to you for 80. No? OK, let's go on. Who likes this one? I like them all. Make an offer. I am doing this for a living. This one is for Contreras. Not good enough for him. Here you are! Make an offer. Let's go to work. - What do you say? - We have to work. Come on! See you! Bye! Nothing sold any today, Coco, this isn't our day. Listen! The knives are great! I mean it! Good morning, pal. Good morning. Didn't you see the entry sign? What sign? I didn't see anything. This is a private property. I am sorry. I just came to sell some knives. Who gave you the authorization? Nobody. You'll have to accompany me. Your ID, please. Wait a sec. Believe me, I don't have them with me. I forgot to take them. I apologize, I must have left them at home. How much is that one? - This one? - Yes. Keep it. Listen, signs are to be read. I'll remember that the next time. Go on, sir! Villegas! How are you? How are you doing, Sabino? What a cleaning! And they had to go and fire me! They plan to open in the Spring. I have your stuff in my cabin. Thanks. And the knives? I think the price is too high. - High? - I'll try to bring it down. Cheap knives from Brazil are flooding the market. Mine are handmade. People only see if they cut. And how is Rosa? She got a job from an agency in Caleta Olivia. She'll be a maid at a hotel. For a woman, it's easier. Besides, she's younger. I keep avoiding it, but any day, I'll be fired. Your tools and a box with some of your stuff. Take a seat. Let's drink some mate. I'll give you your mattress. It's under my own. Keep it if you need it. No, I left it there, 'cause there was no other place. And where is Morci now? Morci went to Rosario, he got a brother there. Wasn't his brother in jail? He must still be there. He was given 30 years. But Morci was in love with his sister-in-law. Is all your stuff there? Nothing missing? Yes, but it doesn't matter. The agency where Rosa got the job... where is it? - Name? - Juan Villegas. - Villega? - Villegas. But everybody calls me Coco. - Profession? - Mechanic. Simple Mechanics. Are you a mechanic or not? Yes, write down mechanic. I've worked in a gas station. And? What happened? It was sold recently. I did everything there: Greasing... Hello? Listen to me. It's not my problem if they don't pay you as agreed. Workpower is not responsible for problems with the employer. Read the contract you signed. I don't care what you think. I delete you from the system. It's that simple. Do what you like. - Age? - Fifty two. Is that a problem? No. In this country, everything can be a problem. Marital Status? Married. But put "single". It's been twenty years... since I last saw my wife. - Well, let's put "single". - Single. Address? I am living with my daughter in Fitz Roy. Things are not going too well, but... Now, you are in the system. And what's next? Can we reach your daughter? Yes, but since I am in the area every day... Here's my card and my number. You call me. Mr. Barreiro... In my spare time, I make knife handles... If you are interested... I can show you one. No, not now. I have them here. OK. Where did you put the bottle? Look at the milk, it's spoiled. Calm down, baby. You can't even wash up. Yes, sweetie. I have to do it all. Get up, lazybones! Look at the example you set. Do you need the bathroom? Go, but don't spend a year in there. Take her, at least for a while. Come on, quick! You'll be late for school. Tucumano, go! Take care of the kid. Come on! Should I check the oil? No, no need to. It's $28.50. Have you been working here long? No, not too long. And you like it? More or less. I worked nearly 20 years in a gas station. Wow. Here's your change. Thanks a lot. I almost forgot. There's a promotion. You have to scratch the card with a coin. - The one you gave me? - Yes. - Here? - Right there. It says something. Let me see. You've won 1 liter of engine oil! Come with me. See? And on top of it, a pair of glasses... same as in the film "Men in Black". Have you seen it? I don't think so. Come in. Hold this. Mario, this man has just won the combo. - Good morning. - Congratulations, sir! Bring up a combo from the shed, in the new boxes. Take it, please I'll write down your name and we'll give you the prize. - Today's my lucky day. - It must be. Do you need a mechanic, or a pump attendant here? No, we're not hiring. Have you tried at Gitano's station? The mechanic near the dell. He is always looking for someone. In the long run, what matters is having a job. - The oil and the glasses. - Here you are. They look expensive. Try them on. You look like a "Man in Black". I can't see anything. They suit you well. - You going to wear them out? - No. "EL GITANO" MECHANICS - What do you want? - Is the boss in? He's having lunch. - Can I wait for him? - What's it about? It's personal. You can wait outside. Thanks. Listen, if you are selling... Nobody buys anything here. No, I am not selling anything. Shit! Who the fuck parked in front of the garage? I am sorry. I'll move it. Didn't you see the sign? NO PARKING Come in. Quick. Don't turn the TV up too loud. The baby's sleeping. Mauro, you've got to show me that note. I got the news. What are you doing? Repairing the pipe. I'll give you a rag to secure it. We better change the pipe. How much will that be? How much can charge you...? It's not expensive, I'll go buy it. Listen, dad... Today, they called me back at the new gas station... "Come, scratch this card". I scratched it off and I won a prize. I won a can of oil with a pair of glasses. I wanted to ask them for the money, but I couldn't. I plan to buy the machine with the severance pay. Spend all your money on that... and you'll end up broke. If I don't make the knife blade myself, it's not worth it. Why don't you look for a job doing what you're good at. So many gas stations are being opened. I'll go to the Basque's shop to get the pipe. Otherwise, you won't have any water. Good morning! Something wrong? Hi, I really don't know. Something must have broken, I pulled over to check. Don't worry! I'll check it for you. Thank you. Is it serious? No, just the fan belt. It's broken. And it needs to be welded, see? They must have welded it wrong. That was my dad, it's his car. Is it easy to repair? If I had a soldering iron... I have one. It's at the ranch. They are always welding there. It's 150 km away. We'll have to tow the car. We'll have to hook it up and tow it. But it's 150 km. It's not so close. Do you have the time? Time is what I have most of. Are you living in the area? No, I am living in Buenos Aires. I was born in Telken. I am from the Patagonia, though I don't look like it. May I smoke? Please. - Would you like one? - Thanks, I don't smoke. I want to smoke while I can... because my mother doesn't let me smoke. It's unbelievable. I am 33, and she still rags on me. And now your dad will rag on you about the car. No, my dad is dead. I am sorry. Don't worry. He's been dead since a year and a half now. And what do you do? I used to work at a gas station. Now I am making knife handles. Knives? Have a look, they are in my bag. They are beautiful. What is it made from? This is a special wood. From the jungles, in Misiones. A friend of mine who lives there sent me the wood. And this one looks like a face. It's a puma's head. You are a real artist! No, well... Thank you. I am going to see mom, she must be very worried. Where is the soldering iron? It must be in the shed. Good afternoon! Good afternoon, ma'am. How do you do? Villegas. A pleasure. So my daughter has dragged you out here. Don't worry, ma'am. It's not unusual. Especially on the highway. When she sets her mind to something... She's so stubborn. She insisted on driving to Comodoro to sell it. If the car is not being used, it'll get ruined. But this is not just any car, is it? It's a good car. That's why! So you cannot sell it just like that. Is it complicated? Mom, just the pulley needs soldering. Let the man explain it to me. I have to solder the pulley, and that's it. Then I put it back and... Is it gonna be expensive? Because, nowadays... I don't know yet. We'll see to that later, when you sell it. To make up for the nuisance, you must stay with us for tea. See all these? All homemade. It's very difficult to find it in the city. It's delicious. Dad was an expert on red currant jam, wasn't he? I could never make it as good as he could. Try the brownies. Those there. The recipe is from a local family. I'm gonna prepare two jars of jam... for you to take. Well, thanks. - And what did your husband do? . -What didn't he do! Everything but politics. Yes, but he always liked to be well-informed. He brought the Hereford cattle to Patagonia... for the first time. He created a lodge for hunting wild boar. He cultivated berries. He always had to have a project going on, he couldn't sit still. But he lived a happy life, in his own way. The last thing was the dogs. He wanted to build an Argentine Dogo Kennels. For export. But, he didn't have the time. Have you ever seen them? Big, white dogs. I think so, yes. In fact, they are fighting dogs. If you raise them that way... If not, like any creature, they are as good as gold. But, genetically they were created to fight. Nobody is born bad. They are not bad, but wild. No, they are hunting animals. Tell me, would you like to take one with you? A dog? I assure you when you see it... you will say yes. The thing is lately I haven't been doing well, economically... and to maintain a dog... They are country dogs, My husband bought it to start up the kennels. But he died soon after the dog arrived. It's the son of a famous dog. Of a grand champion. He's a great breed. I have the papers. It breaks my heart, to see him lying there all day long. But I am not in shape for taking care of a dog. Have a look at it. It maybe good company for a man who is alone. Now he looks sad, but he was so playful by the time he'd arrived. I would be very happy if a person like you would take him. Here are the papers. The name of his father: "Quilapn de los Andes". A grand champion. The inscription number, the vaccines. And here it is, Kennels "Le Chien". "Le Chien" because my husband was French. An extraordinary dog. Come with me. Watch the trench. It's not finished. Come in. KENNELS "LE CHIEN" And? What do you think? He's a posh dog, isn't he? Come on down. Coming down... Let's go home. Come on, Lechien. Let's go home. Come on. Mom, come and see! What are you talking about? A white dog, for real. Where did it come from? Dad, where did this dog come from? It's tied up, he won't do any harm. What is it doing here? I brought it here. How come you did that? Have you gone mad? Tucumano! Take the dog out of here! Never in your fucking life did you want a dog. Now suddenly you want a dog! What happened to you, are you senile? Tucumano, take that dog out of here. I can't even hang the clothes. I don't want dogs here. Understand? I don't want dogs here. - I've filled it with $20. - Thanks. That man there, wants to talk to you. - Who? - There, that man. Good afternoon. Is that dog yours? I have a wool warehouse and I need some security. For three or four days... Until they take the wool out. I never leave the dog alone. No, I'll hire you as a security guard... with the dog. I'll give $30 per day. What do you say? Maybe, yes. Follow me. If Galvan comes, my former guard, and he is drunk... don't let him in. If he wants to collect his stuff, tell him to come tomorrow afternoon when I am here. If he insists, you set the dog on him. I don't object to that. Come in. Let the dog loose. I better keep him nearby. You know best. You will stay here. It's a bit dirty... But, come in. There's a heater, some food. And now, please help me shut the main door. Open up or III kill you! Open up, you! Open up, son of a bitch! Calm down! Down, Lechien! Lechien, sit! Sit. Get the dog away from me. Please. - Are you Galvan? - Yes. I have orders not to let you in. Come and must pick up your stuff in the afternoon. I can't come in the afternoon, my friend. These are my orders. It's just a few things. I'll take them and go. It will only take me ten minutes. Please, I'm begging you. In 5 minutes, I'll be out. Can you take it all? In a bag or something. I am out of luck. Forgive me. Where are you going? Galvan is in there, he wants to talk to you. Excuse me, you cannot enter with the dog. I'll be out in a sec. Nothing personal, but you can't go in the bank with a dog. God! If I tie him up there, will you keep an eye on him? It's a problem. What if the animal bites someone? He would not bite a soul. He's a hunting dog. He is friendly. Tie him up, but I didn't see a thing. Come on, Lechien. We have got to get paid. - Good morning, Roque. - Good morning, Mr. Accountant. You left the lights on. Thanks. Again with these new rules... Excuse me, is that your dog? Yes. - Nice animal. - Yes, nice. - What's his name? - Lechien. Lechien? May I? Sure, yes, pet him. He might be a good hunter. Did you try him with pigs? Not yet. A very good hunter. Because of his bite, you know? He's got a perfect bite. Yes, I think so. And he may do very well in races. May I? Strong legs. - A very good specimen. - Good, isn't it? Yeah, very good. You could try him at the races. - Have you got his papers? - Yes. Why don't you train him? I can recommend someone to train him. - Are you coming to the bank? - Yes. Come with me, I'll give you his address. - Accountant, the lights. - I forgot again. - Do me a favor, turn them off. - All right. Come in. You were coming to the bank, right? - And what for? - I have to cash a check. Give it to me, I will get it cashed for you. Thank you very much. - Good morning, Marta. - Good morning, sir. - Cash this for me, please. - Sure. Come in. Make yourself at home. Very well, let's see... The man I've mentioned is Walter Donado. He is an ace preparing dogs for exhibitions. I don't know a thing about dogs. Don't worry, this man is a genius. He lives in Trelew. I am looking for his address. He's easy to find. He's in charge of the motordrome. Here he is. I'll write down his address on one of my cards. Here's his address and phone number. Tell him you know Zacarias at the Bank of Santa Cruz. He owes me many favors. Thank you. While we wait for the money, let me show you something. See what kind of animal you have. My favorite for many years. A great dog. He fell down a hill with a wild boar, 300 meters down. Already dead, we had to break his jaw to make him let it loose. Take a look at that one. Gutted by a wild boar. Everything was put back in again, he was sewed up, and the next day, he was as good as new. They don't feel pain. Absolutely insensitive to pain. Let me break it to you, they are beasts from outer space. - Excuse me. - Come in. Here is the money from the check. Is it for him? Yes. I need your signature here. - Of course. - Here's a pen. Here. - Here you are. - Thanks a lot. - Please, don't mention it. - It won't be necessary. Every month we hunt at a friend's estate. This month is at Dr. Recabarren's in Laguna Grande. If you have some time to spare, call me and come with us. And bring the beast, so he starts learning. I don't know anything about dogs. I know very little. Don't worry, you will acquire the taste for it. Yes, I am a friend of Zacarias... at the Bank of Santa Cruz. No, I'm not calling about that. I don't work for the bank. The thing is I have a dog... and Mr. Zacarias gave me your name. I just wanted to know if we could train the dog together. He's the son of "Quilo of the Andes" "Quillapn de los Andes", yes, sorry. Trelew's motordrome. Yes, I was told. Yes, I can go there today. Wait in the car. Good morning! Good morning. I am looking for Walter Donado. He's not here. He went to Trelew to get some bolts. But I was told he lives here. Yes, next to that office. I'll show you there. Good afternoon. Excuse me, I am looking for Walter. He just happens to be out. He went to buy some bolts. - I was already told. - He'll be back soon. - Then, I'll wait outside. - Would you mind coming in? - Isn't it too much trouble? - Not at all. Thank you. Please, come in. Mabel, say hello to the man. Take a seat. Would you like a mate tea? Thank you, ma'am. Hi, sweetie. Are you studying? Poor girl, she's lost her voice because of the nerves. The nerves? She's got to recite next Thursday at the Town Council. That's why. When she was little, she recited marvellously. And now, she's nervous and her voice has gone. Come on, Mabel, recite to the man. "Dark swallows will come back... and nest on your balcony... and once more, their wings against your window pane... She is getting nervous, but she knows it by heart. Come on, Mabelita, slower. Come on. Dark swallows will come back... We can't understand if your voice is so hoarse. Dark swallows will... I can't do it right! See? That's how she gets! She's nervous. But I am fed up with her. What a disgrace. Don't say a word! I've already seen him in the truck! - This man... ...has a hell of a dog! - A pleasure. - Walter Donado. You have pure gold! Do you like him? Have a seat and we'll take a look at his papers. All right. That's it. Here are the vaccines. Very important. Of course, his mother is "Crystal Goddess of the Apostles". But, didn't this dog belong to a French man? Yes, his widow gave it to me. Why are we still sitting here? Let's go see him. Can I tell you something? This dog, well trained, will make us rich. You sure? Have you thought about selling it? No, not yet. What a head you have! Can you do me favor? Take me to Gelsi's house, the President of the Association. - Sure, let's go. - I want him to see the dog. Shall we go? He'll drop dead! Let me tell you, Villegas. Presenting a dog at a show is no small matter. It is an art. You have to know how to present a dog. It's like the career of a football player. You present him wrong, and you ruin his future. First you have to present the dog at small provincial shows... and then at the international level. I know of dogs who where wrongly presented... and their careers were ruined. And they were good dogs! That's why it's important to build a name for the dog. Let the people get to know him, ask about him. And people will start to request the stud services. The Baha Blanca Show comes in a week. Three general competitions and an Aptitude Test. Do you want to present him there? One week? One week will do miracles. We need to walk him a bit, teach him to raise up his head. Make him stand still... I've never been to a dog show. You have to see it. Remind me to show you a magazine. In 1994, we went to the USA, to Tampa. A total success! I'm in one of the pictures. When we get back home, I'll show it to you. The thing is, I am a bit short of cash. Let's make a deal. I train the dog, I give you shelter and food... and we split the profits fifty-fifty. - Do we have a deal? - Deal! Partners! Don't tell me that he doesn't look like his father! He looks quite good. Looks quite good?? This must be one of the puppies... he had with Rocatagliata's female dog. Exactly, sir! A French man... Let's get him down so they can get a look at him. Lechien, down! Come on, Lechien. Leave him alone. He will get down by himself. Yeah, he always gets down by himself. Come on, don't give a bad impression. He's a bit nervous. Come on. You better leave him! It's just a scratch. It's nothing. - He doesn't have rabies, does he? - These dogs don't get rabies. He sure has character. Our friend made his debut. A dogo owner with no scar, is not a real dogo owner. Do you know why he did it? Because he loves you. Look at me! Taking two dogs apart. Double fracture. Radio, ulna and five tendons. And it wasn't even on purpose! Well, friend... Welcome to the club! Come in, Villegas. Come in, brother. I want you to feel at home here. We never use this place. Except for Saturdays or Sundays if a lunatic wants to test a car... or if there's a car race. Follow me, I am gonna put your mattress here. This is gonna be your room. Your mattress goes here. Let the dog loose. - Won't he run away? - What I promise to show you. You'll see. Tampa, Miami 1994. Check out this dog show! This is the Argentine delegation. See if you find someone you know. Look carefully! It's you! Sixty people travelled. We were pretty close to winning the first series. And you took the dogs with you? It's a Canine Exhibition. How could we go with no dogs? What an idiot! You can't imagine how much money is at stake. In the USA alone, there's 80 million dogs. They're almost the biggest minority. And then you have: Sponsors, dog food, laboratories, vaccine producers, dog collar manufacterers... It's incredible the amount of money behind all that. Listen, when this dog takes off... we will need a sponsor. No sponsor and you are dead. But, first things first. Next step is Baha Blanca. Have a good rest. Tomorrow we'll start training early. Thanks. See you tomorrow. I'll leave the flashlight here. In 10 minutes, I turn off the generator. Left, right, left. Left, left again. Left, right, left. That's right. Very good, Villegas. Stop him, Villegas. Turn around. Now at a trot. Now turn him around! Pull him. Pull him hard. Hard. The head is very important. And the hand. Mark his head. And regarding his head... A wet towel to clean. So that the dog stays as good as new. See? He's covered with it. Stay still so that I can watch from a distance. Just a bit more. - You will do well in Baha Blanca. - You think so? Walter has a special eye for this. The great day has come! Yes, sir! What time is it? 3 A.M. But we have a long way to go. I got these clothes for you. And this cap, this is my gift. Come on, Villegas. Drink a mate and wake up. Handsome! Do I look OK? A real exhibitor! Wait for me here, I have to check our position. Good morning. Are you the owner of the dog? Here's a pin. - Thanks. - You are welcome. Villegas! See what I brought you! Look who's here. Lechien. Walter Donado and Juan Villegas. See that guy with the yellow shirt, combing the white dog? See him? With that little white dog, he was three time national champ... and twice Panamerican champion With the money that little dog gave him... he bought a car for his wife and paid cash for a house. And with this shitty economy! Imagine what the dog business is like! Argentine Dogo, Male Category, please enter the track... They are calling us. We're ready. We have to take him to the track. Come on, champ, Go get 'em. No, you stay here! You watch and enjoy. We will go and win that prize. N 203, Bombn of Le chien. N 122, Achilles of Cimarrn. N 74, Pechito of La Manchega. Male Dogos participants line up for inspection. - Judge Villarreal... - Move a bit there... Here you are. Is now inspecting and judging the animals. They are eight in total. Hi, sweetie. Very good, friend. Very good. Go up there and come back, in circles, please. And after the prize, there will be a drawing... for a bicycle and a pair of skates. Very good, stay behind that one. We are about to announce the decision... the top prize for the best specimen... Show me the number. That will pass to the final selection. Its a time of mystery and tension... that repeats itself for each breed and category. Dr. Villarreal has already made a decision. The winner of the category Adult Male... Dogo Argentine is... You are the winner. The specimen N 703, Bombn of Lechien. What did I tell you? But let's keep a low profile... that's how you celebrate the first round. What did the judge tell you? - Is he any good? - And what do you think? We won the first round and will go to the finals. Dear friends, The moment you were waiting for is finally here. Now we will choose the best three dogs. Take the dog and guide him. Come on! They are calling you! How come you don't want to? Do you want him to be disqualified?! Run! Come on, Lechien! Sir, there! Wait, you have to stand there. There. Please, stand him up straight. The President of the Jury, Mr. Martn Collazo, making his usual inspection... of the category winners... in the 3rd. Canine Exhibition of Baha Blanca. All of them, beautiful animals... of the most conspicuous breeds of our country. We are about to have the final results. Mr. Collazo and Dr. Alvenazzi, Secretary of this beautiful exhibition are finalizing the details. The judge is asking for the trophies! Now, form a a circle, go on. And now, the traditional lap of the winners. - First prize for... - The first... Caniche Toy, N 769. - Second prize for... - The second! - Belgian Shepperd, N 767. - Third prize for... - The third! Argentine Dogo, Bombn of Lechien. N 703. Excuse me! Excuse me! Third prize, I told you! And on top of that, I've sold a stud service. - For the dog? - Sure, who else? We have to call this guy tomorrow. He's got a female dog just in time. We can easily charge him $600. 600, if you are in the business, you know he is worth every penny. I don't know of a dog that does a service for $400. We can offer you a discount. 450 and we have a deal. I have everything, even the Brucellosis Test. This animal has had all his check-ups. Here is your order. Relax, I have the address. We will be there tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Money! - How much? - $7.50 Charge it to our account. No, I only take cash. How come? In Miami, we never paid cash. What is it with this country? Give him $8, he can keep the change. Yes, I've got it. Let's toast. To the future, to this partnership, that was born to win! And to Lechien! To Lechien! Do you like the fat girl? She sings well. Sings well! She reminds me of a girlfriend... I had thirty years ago. - Are you sure it's not her? - Don't think so. I'll bring her over here, maybe she's your girl. Coco Villegas. A pleasure, Susana. He's a breeder of dogos... the most important in the Patagonia. His dog won today in Baha Blanca... First prize. - Congratulations! - Thank you very much. The dog has to be congratulated, but he wasn't allowed in. Would you like a drink? Waiter, a glass! Your work must be very interesting. Traveling from one exhibition to the other. In fact, he is the one who does most of the traveling. Actually, we have to show a dog in the States. Wonderful. But it's a very important business up there. They have 80 million dogs. They are the top minority. It must be very exciting! No, please serve me here. Please, a moment of silence. Let's toast. Your attention, please. Let's make a toast... to the owner of the best dog... who won the Baha Blanca Dog Show today! Mr. Coco Villegas! And to Lechien, the champ dog that it wasn't allowed in here! You sing so nice. I thought you were Arab. No, as a girl I worked at a Lebanese's shop. So I got used to hearing the music. It must be very difficult. Not for someone who likes to sing. No, I meant to understand the meaning. I sing by phonetics. I don't know the meaning. But I always do some research so as not to offend anyone. This is a family restaurant. Leave her alone! The show is for all of us! Give her some money, stinge! Who was the bastard? Who was it? So you like throwing bread? Calm down, fat boy! Stop it! Get out, you idiots! Don't worry. They'll keep him for a few hours... to teach him a lesson. Tomorrow they'll him out. In these parties, there's always a boozer. Is this the one who won the prize? He's very beautiful. I had a tiny little dog... when I lived in Buenos Aires. A Pomeranian. Did you live in Buenos Aires? Yes, for two years. I sang at the Club Horizonte. A Syrian-Lebanese club, but really posh. Very rich people went there. We are just 5 blocks from home. When you plan to throw a party, call me. I'll organize it for you. "Zaida" is my stage name. I'll get you the musicians... everything, even an odalisque if you like. We can have a coffee. No, I don't want to bother you. Look at the time. It's no trouble. You bothered to take me home. Have a coffee and then you can leave. Come in. - Excuse me. - Make yourself at home. I am gonna prepare the hot coffee I promised. Thank you. Do you like Turkish coffee? Today I only had Turkish food. This house was built by my dad... a few months before he married mom. It looks pretty nice. Don't be so sure. I have to repair the roof up there. It leaks. But, anyway... I'm gonna prepare Turkish coffee in this jar. Look. Bronze on the outside, tin on the inside. - Be careful, it's hot. - Thanks. Did you notice something on your tongue? It's the grinds. When you finish drinking it, it will stay in the cup. Do you want me to read it to you? Read it to me? The grinds can be read. They tell you the future, for real. OK. I'll explain. You place the cup here, cover it... and now turn over the saucer. - I turn it over? - And keep it that way. Leave it on the table. There you are. Lift it up slowly. That's it. Give it to me. You've lied to me. You are the one who travels a lot. And you will keep traveling. Yes? You sure? I can see a long trip, to buy some land. Is that possible? - Or a piece of land - Maybe a lot. A small piece of land, that could be possible. There are very nice places around here. I can accompany you, whenever you like. He's got no criminal record. But nothing can be done, until the officer comes... tomorrow morning. Last night he got drunk, but he is a nice person. Then, tell him to control himself. Would you like to see him? If that is possible. Come with me. Here he is! Ask him! Who was the one who started throwing bread? Are you crazy? What does it matter? I was having fun, dancing, not bothering anyone. And suddenly, they throw a piece of bread at my neck. Not a small piece, but a whole bread roll. Five minutes. Listen, take the dog to this man, Pascual... for the stud service. Do you have his number? No. Here. Have the guy sign the service certificate beforehand. The dog mustn't mount her... if the guy does not sign. I know this business well. It's full of swindlers. - Yes? - Mr. Pascual? You came a bit early. Well, come in. This way. I've taken Pamela's temperature, she's almost ready. Do you have the papers, vaccines, tests? Yes, here they are. Have a seat. "Bombn de Le Chien" is that the dog's name? No, Lechien. "Bombn de Lechien" Lechien is the kennel. Who came up with Bombn for a Dogo? I will take Pamela's temperature again. That big guy told me you had many dogs. He told me you were expanding the kennel. Well, yes. I'll be right back. Pamela, come here! This is a thermometer. Come near, Pamela! Get out of the doghouse! Can't you see it's a thermometer? Come, it's time they met. Come on, Lechien. I hope the bride likes him. This female dog is inexperienced, and yours? I think so, yes. What? That fat guy told me he had done stud services already. Maybe, yes. That fat guy is a swindler. No, he knows a lot. Come in. Take him in. I've told you. Now we are in trouble. Let's leave them alone, see if they get to know each other. Nature is wise, come. This dog is a coward! He does not even get out! She's in heat today... I'll have to wait another six months! Who pays me for the food? Who pays me the lost profits? Who? You? Why did I mess with you, shit! Now I know why you named him "Bombn". I had already arranged with a three year old male, a super stud! Where the fuck can I get a dog now? I curse the day... I talked to that fat guy! Where the fuck is he? How did it go? Not so well. The dog got scared. What happened? The dog couldn't do it. How come he couldn't? He got inside the doghouse and refused to do anything. But he needs help. The dog doesn't know how. Besides, the man got upset. What an idiot! The dog doesn't know, he needs some help. They are like teenagers. And what do we do now? We look for an experienced female dog to teach him. Remember your the first time? Anybody taught you? And if he can't do it... What will we do? No way he can't do it! This business is about dog reproduction. To offer stud services and produce puppies. It's a factory. Here it is. In Entrevero. Pull up when you see a phone. This guy, had fantastic female dogs last year. Wait a sec. I make the call and I'm back. - How're you? - Good afternoon! - How are things going? - Good. And you? Same as always. The YPF station of yours... Did it shut down? Yes, a long time ago. And I was sacked. Are you working for another station? - No, I took up a new trade. - You took up a new trade? Now I raise dogs. I am an exhibitor. A dog exhibitor! Who would imagine! There's one here in the back. What an animal. He's very well raised! Stay put, Lechien! He's got some character. I need a dog like this. We are getting robbed twice a month. Can you sell me a puppy of his? Maybe later on. In a while. Reserve one for me. A male. Hi. - See you later. - Later, don't forget! It's all set. I've just talked with Omar. He's got a female dog in heat. She's perfect. Old and experienced. She's gone through heat twice without a service. He'll get her pregnant just by looking at her. What puppy was he talking about? He wants a son of his. Haven't I told you? They sell like sliced bread. And once he acquires the taste... This bitch has no papers... but god, is she good! Old and no papers. You must pay me instead. If your dog doesn't learn with this bitch, he'll never learn. Carmelo! Is Malena in heat? - She's just begun. - Bring her in. Pamela is her daughter. If he doesn't learn with the two of them... What a party! Bring the female dog, please. Help me, Villegas. Let him loose, he's getting mad. Come on, Lechien! Come on, the little bitch. Lechien is going mad. Lechien! That way! He went inside. This is a new breed, pal. Something is wrong with this dog. Maybe he suffered some childhood trauma. Since he had no owner... Let's help him mount. So that we can teach him the way to do it. He needs some help. I'll help you. Come on, Lechien! What's wrong with him? Come on! Nothing is going on with this dog! That can't be! You'll have to do artificial insemmination. That's for posh dogs. Everybody will laugh at me at the Association. If not, you will have a dog for decoration. He's a wonderful specimen. His only problem is his libido. He has no libido. I've seen similar cases. But this is an extreme case. Keep in mind the dog is quite grown up. And what about celery? No, those things are... Chinese stuff. Not credible. Anyway, he is a beautiful specimen. He has an excellent character. It's a dog with many skills. It can be trained for many activities. To bring you the morning paper, for example. A very domestic dog. Do you know something? That guy may be a vet or whatever... but any time, this dog will give us a surprise. That's Animal Business. Stay here in Baha Blanca. Get a job, you are a mechanic. Forget about the dog, for a week or two. You know I won't charge you for that. What's wrong, Villegas? You can call anytime. When you settle down, take him with you. Relax, you know I will take good care of him. I almost forgot! I paid for the dog's inscription at the show. $25. Keep that paper. It's always a record. Here comes the bus! Can you open the luggage compartment? Is it a dog? Yes, but he's used to traveling. Be good, Lechien. Don't worry, I'll take care of him. As soon as you settle down, give me a call. GOD IS LOVE - Good morning! - Hi. - Is there a phone here? - Not here. - How much are these alfajores? - Six pesos. Please. I brought this for you. I can't accept it. It must have taken a lot of work. It doesn't matter. You can use it in the kitchen... This is not for the kitchen. Or you can just keep it. OK, thanks, I'll take good care of it. It's a cat? Right? It's a puma. - Yes, a puma. - Sure, a puma. And the dog? Walter took him, the big guy. He has space for him. I love dogs. But it's a problem to travel with them. Did I tell you I had had a Pomeranian in Buenos Aires? When my dad fell ill, I had to come here... and left it with a friend. Then, she told me the dog got very sad... and after a while, she died. You get used to a dog's company. It's like the people you love. You don't notice how much you love them... till they are gone. Good morning - How are you, ma'am? - Well, yeah. Walter? Every time you come, Walter is not in. They are driving him mad with the races. It's about the dog? Walter tried to call you, but he didn't know where. The dog has escaped. He escaped? It must have been early, about 5 A.M. I got up at 8 and he was already gone. Poor Walter, he was so worried. Good morning! Haven't you seen the white dog that Walter had, the caretaker? I saw it a few days ago. He was training him. Haven't you seen him today? Not today. He's a good dog, isn't he? Yes. - What breed? - A Dogo. Maybe they've stolen it from you. Watch out for the people from "El Progreso". People are wild out there. I heard they eat dogs there. Boy, have you seen a big white dog? Have you seen a big white dog around here? No. Not here. Look around there, the brick factory. - The brick factory? - Yes. - Towards the smoke? - Yes, over there. I am looking for a big white dog. I've seen him, over there. Thanks. Bombn? Bombn? Haven't you seen a white dog around here? He must be over by the bricks. Near the pile of bricks. Lechien? Come here, Bombn. Lechien? Bombn? Good morning. - Going to Viedma? - No, Baha Blanca. - Can you give us a ride? - Yes, sure, get in. I'll just move the dog. - Does he bite? - No, he is friendly. - Thanks. - Thank you, sir. Do you plan to stay long in Buenos Aires? We hope so, don't know yet. We are going there, because there is work. We are trying our luck. - Have you ever been there? - No. And you? I haven't gone before, and now... What do you do? - I breed dogs. - That's nice. I am an exhibitor. What is it like to be an exhibitor? You present dogs in exhibitions. You can win great prizes. And do you have many? At the moment, only this one. But in the future, if things get better... No, I meant if you had won many prizes. Yes, a few. Not so many yet.
