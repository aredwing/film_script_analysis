THIS COLLEGE KID COMES IN. HE'S SOAKED IN BLOOD, LIKE HE TOOK A BATH IN IT. THING IS, HE'S GOT NO INJURIES. ALL THE BLOOD BELONGS TO THE VIC, A JENNY GARRISON. HE CLAIMS HE DIDN'T DO IT.

OR I'LL HAVE YOU HUMPING DESKS FROM HERE TO THE NEW STATION, ALL RIGHT? GOT IT? SORRY, MILES. GO AHEAD. - I COULDN'T FIND ONE. SO I TURNED AWAY FOR A SECOND. - YOU WANT TO SEE THESE? - AND THEN I FELT-- THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF MY NECK STOOD UP. AND THEN WHEN I LOOKED BACK, HE WAS STANDING BEHIND JENNY. - WHO? - I DON'T KNOW WHO. - HE SAYS SOMEONE JUST APPEARED THERE. - I DIDN'T HEAR A NOISE. NO DOOR OR ANYTHING. NO FOOTSTEPS. HE WAS, LIKE, OUT OF NOWHERE.

PLEASE TELL THOSE TWO IDIOTS TO TREAT DIAMANTE WITH A LITTLE RESPECT. HE'S ONE OF US. IMAGINE RESPONDING TO A CALL, AND YOUR WIFE IS SPLIT IN HALF. AND WHILE YOU'RE MOPPING UP THE BLOOD, YOU FIND OU THAT YOUR KID IS GONE, TAKEN BY THAT ANIMAL. HE'S NOT A LUCKY GUY. - HEY. CAN I TALK TO YOU? WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE. I JUST RAN HIS PRINTS. I GOT TEN DIFFERENT NAMES, A DIFFERENT NAME FOR EACH FINGER, ALL DECEASED, ALL VICTIMS OF VIOLENT MURDERS. - AND YOU'RE SURPRISED? DOES ANYTHING FUCKING WORK IN THIS PLACE?

I JUST NEED HIM FOR THE INTERROGATION, AND YOU CAN OBSERVE. - IF YOU DON'T WAN TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS, WE CAN GO. - NO, I--I'D LIKE TO, EMILY. I NEED THIS. - CLOSURE, RIGHT? [suspenseful music]  [music swells]  - I'M TOM CARETTI. THIS IS ERIN COLE. - [echoing] OFFICERS.  - HE WALKS IN THE FRONT DOOR WITH JENNY GARRISON'S HEAD, DRIVES A STOLEN VAN LOADED WITH HUMAN REMAINS. - DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE MUCH SENSE, DOES IT? SERIAL KILLER I'D THOUGHT TO BE DEAD, COMES BACK TO LIFE AND TURNS HIMSELF IN AFTER 13 YEARS. MAYBE I'M NOT SO CRAZY. - COLE, WHAT DO YOU GO ON THIS BOOK? - SOME OF IT'S WRITTEN IN AN ANCIENT DIALECT, BUT THE TITLE IS A DIREC TRANSLATION FROM GERMAN: "EVERY HUNDRED YEARS." - MAY I? - WHAT DO YOU THINK? - ONE OF MY PATIENTS WAS AN OLD GERMAN WOMAN WHO CLAIMED SHE WAS IMPREGNATED BY A DEMON, A DEMON WHO NEEDED A HUMAN HOS TO REGENERATE. AT THE END OF ITS 100-YEAR LIFE CYCLE, HE WOULD FIND A HOST, PLANT A SEED, AND DIE AT SUNRISE. [sighs] SHE CLAIMED THE BIRTH ALMOST KILLED HER. HER NIGHTMARES WERE SO INTENSE, SHE HAD TO SLEEP IN FOUR-POINT RESTRAINTS. - A DEMON THAT DOES THE NASTY, IT'S, LIKE, RIGHT OU OF A COMIC BOOK. - THAT DEMON IS CALLED AN INCUBUS. - SO... WHAT IS THE SUBTITLE OF THIS BOOK? - IHR GESTALT IST MEINE. "YOUR MIND IS MINE." LET'S SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. - GIL DIAMANTE. YOU LOOK SURPRISINGLY WELL, SIR. - SO... WE FINALLY GET TO MEET, FACE-TO-FACE. - INKUBUS, RIGHT? OH, A STARING CONTEST. YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN STARE TOO. I HAVE ALL NIGHT LONG. - AH, YES. A GOOD STARE, THE SUMMI WHERE SOULS CONNECT. - I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOUR BULLSHIT, OKAY? BEFORE I ASK ANY QUESTIONS, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO TELL US? - NO. - HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE TONIGHT? - MAGIC. - MAGIC? LIKE DAVID COPPERFIELD? - [chuckling] NO, NO, NO. HE'S AN ILLUSIONIST. THOSE ARE TRICKS, MISDIRECTION, SLEIGHT OF HAND. REAL MAGIC BENDS REALITY. - SO HOW DID YOU GE INTO JENNY GARRISON'S ROOM? DID YOU JUS ABRACADABRA YOURSELF INTO IT? - YES, AND THEN I CUT OFF HER HEAD AND LEFT FOR HERE. - ANY REASON? - IT'S WHAT I DO. BESIDES, HOW ELSE WAS I GOING TO ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION? SO HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN NOW, HMM? I'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN HOW GOOD IT FEELS. - MAGIC OR KILLING? - KILLING IS MAGIC. YOU SEE-- IT'S CARETTI, ISN'T IT? - DETECTIVE CARETTI. - YES, WELL... I HAD BECOME FRUSTRATED AT NOT RECEIVING THE ACCLAIM I SO RICHLY DESERVE, SO I BEGAN USING MY MARK. - THE "K"? - YES, THE "K." EVEN THEN, SOME GLORY HOUND ATTEMPTED TO TAKE CREDI FOR MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS. - LET ME SEE IF I GET THIS STRAIGHT. THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT YOU GETTING CREDI FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE, KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE EGO TRIP? SO WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE NOT JUS SOME FUCKING GLORY HOUND? - WELL, IF ANYONE SHOULD KNOW, IT SHOULD BE YOU. YOU WERE THE BEST. YOU GOT THE CLOSEST TO ME. WHEN CHRIS DAWSON WAS ARRESTED FOR MY KILL, IT WAS YOU WHO PROVED IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIM. YOU KNEW YOU HAD THE WRONG MAN, JUST LIKE THE MAN I KILLED THAT THE COPS I.D.'D AS INKUBUS. - I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THIS. - DIAMANTE AND HIS TEAM WERE GETTING CLOSE. YOU WERE RUTHLESS, RELENTLESS. SO I KILLED A VAGRAN TO THROW OFF THE SCENT. YOU WERE RIGHT, GIL. BUT NOBODY WOULD LISTEN. SO CASE CLOSED. I CAN'T IMAGINE THE PAIN YOU MUST HAVE ENDURED, THE HUMILIATION. BUT I DO LIKE TO TRY. - OKAY, WE'RE DONE HERE. - OH... BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE LEFT TO TELL, ALL THE ONES YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT. MARILYN SHEPPARD OF BAY VILLAGE. CAROLINE CONNORS OF PENNSYLVANIA. ELIZABETH SHOR OF LOS ANGELES. AMBROSE SMALL OF TORONTO, CANADA. CATHERINE EDDOWES, MARY JANE KELLY, ALL... ALL OF LONDON TOWN. - MARILYN SHEPPARD'S MURDER WAS CALLED THE SAM SHEPPARD CASE, BECAUSE EVERYBODY THOUGH HER HUSBAND HAD COMMITTED THE MURDER. ELIZABETH SHORT, THE FAMOUS BLACK DAHLIA FROM HOLLYWOOD. - SHOOTING A LITTLE HIGH, AREN'T YOU, BUDDY? - AMBROSE SMALL WAS A MILLIONAIRE WHO VANISHED INTO THIN AIR IN 1919. THOSE OTHER FIVE WERE THE VICTIMS OF THE WHITECHAPEL MURDERS, - BIT OBSESSED, AREN'T WE, GILBERT, MM? [chuckles] YOU HAVE NOT LOST YOUR TOUCH, SIR. - SO YOU'RE NOW JACK THE RIPPER. [slaps table] - I AM NOT FINISHED HERE, DETECTIVE. BENJAMIN BATHURS OF NORWICH, ENGLAND. JACQUELINE FORCHE OF GAY PAREE. SOFIA AND ERNESTO GIANNINI OF FIRENZE, ITALIA. AND MY LOVELIES: LORELEI, ADELAIDE, GRETCHEN, AND THE GERHARDT TWINS, HEIDI UND ZELDA FROM COLOGNE. YOU WON'T FIND ANY RECORDS OF MURDERS PRIOR TO 1800. YOUR KIND WAS A LOT LESS THOROUGH BACK THEN. - 1891, THEY WERE CALLED THE COLOGNE MURDERS. FIVE TEENAGE GIRLS, VIRGINS, WERE KIDNAPPED AND THEIR BODIES MUTILATED AND LEFT IN THE WOODS OUTSIDE THE CITY. IT WAS FURTHER REPORTED THA THEIR BODIES HAD BEEN BLED DRY AND THAT THE KILLER HAD BOTH BATHED IN AND DRANK THEIR BLOOD. - BRAVO. - ARE YOU KIDDING ME? - IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE. - SO WHY DID YOU TURN YOURSELF IN NOW? - I AM NOT TURNING MYSELF IN. GIL, HERE, AND I HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS TO TEND TO. SORRY ABOUT THE MISSUS. - WE'RE DONE HERE. MOST OF THOSE MURDERS THAT YOU JUST CONFESSED TO WERE DONE OVER 100 YEARS AGO. YOU'VE LOST YOUR CREDIBILITY. - THE SECRET TO IMMORTALITY IS FOUND IN THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT, LIKE, UH, YOUR LADY FRIEND THERE, BEHIND THE GLASS. [sighs] GIL, I'M FRANKLY SURPRISED THAT YOU HAVEN'T INQUIRED ABOUT DAVID. DO YOU THINK YOUR SON WOULD HAVE LIVED UP TO THE DIE-AMANTE NAME? - MY FAMILY NAME IS DIAMANTE, NOT DIE-AMANTE, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE. - YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES? - YES! ABRA-FUCKING-CADABRA. [door bangs open] - ALL RIGHT, GUYS. PUT THIS GUY IN A HOLDING CELL, PLEASE. - YOU GOT IT, DETECTIVE. - [sighs] - LOOK, I WAS THERE... I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. HE PLAYS THESE MIND GAMES. HE VANISHED RIGHT IN FRON OF MY EYES. YOU SEE WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO SEE. BUT I SAW THE TRUTH. - WHAT IS THE TRUTH? - THE TRUTH IS, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. - [grunts] - [winces] FUCK. - WHAT'S THE MATTER, MY PUSS?

[cuffs jingling] - WHAT THE FUCK! - CUFF HIM! - [laughing] CUFF ME, PRETTY BOY. [echoing, whooshing noises] - [grunts] - AH! - I'LL SHOW YOU "PUSS," YOU FUCK-FACE. - [yelps] [grunts] - ALL THE MURDERS HE HAS CONFESSED TO ARE EITHER UNSOLVED OR ATTRIBUTED TO INKUBUS... EXCEPT FOR TWO. IN THE MURDER OF PHILIP DARROW, HIS WIFE WAS ARRESTED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH. IN THE MURDER OF CAROLINE CONNORS, HER HUSBAND WAS CONVICTED AND DIED IN PRISON. IN BOTH CASES, THE CONVICTED MURDERER WAS THE ONLY EYEWITNESS. - THE CONVICTED MURDERER CLAIMED THA THEY SAW A DARK STRANGER THAT APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE AND MURDERED THE VICTIMS. LISTEN TO ME. DO NOT LET THAT THING OUT OF YOUR SIGHT. ALL RIGHT? ALL YOUR LIVES DEPEND ON THAT. - CAN WE GO NOW? [loud banging] - WHAT WAS THAT? - INKUBUS JUST HUNG HIMSELF IN HIS CELL! - OH, MY GOD. - OH, GOD, NO. NOT AGAIN. - [gags] - GO UPSTAIRS. LOCK THE DOORS. - FUCKER! - RELAX! - GET HIM UP THERE NOW. LOCK THE DOORS. - [shouting indistinctly] - MUDGE, GET MILES! SHIT, INKUBUS MUST HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE STORAGE LOCKER, AND HE GOT HIS WRIST KNIFE, 'CAUSE IT IS MISSING. YOU KNOW WHAT, I NEED AN A.P.B. ON HIM NOW. I NEED BACKUP. NOW! CAPTAIN, CAN I COUNT ON YOU? - NOT A GOOD IDEA, LIEUTENANT. MY PATIENT NEEDS TO LEAVE NOW. - IT'S ALL RIGHT, EMILY. I CAN LEND A HAND. - WHAT? - LISTEN, HE'S GOT THE EXPERIENCE. WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GE UNTIL BACKUP COMES HERE, OKAY? GET HER IN THE BREAK ROOM, BARRICADE THE DOOR, AND DON'T LET ANYBODY IN.

YOU KNOW THAT. ALL THESE YEARS... NOT KNOWING WHETHER YOU WERE ALIVE OR-- - I'M FINE. HE TAUGHT ME. HE'S A GOOD FATHER. - WHAT DID HE TEACH YOU? - HOW WEAK PEOPLE ARE. YOU TAKE ONE SIMPLE THING AWAY FROM THEM, AND THEIR LIVES ARE NEVER THE SAME. THEY CRUMBLE. HE NEVER WANTED ME TO BE LIKE THAT. - AND ARE YOU, LIKE THAT? - NO. - YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOUR MOM. DO YOU REMEMBER LIVING WITH YOUR MOM AND ME? - YOU'RE CLINGING TO A LIFE THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE. - THAT'S ALL I'VE HAD TO CLING TO THESE PAST 13 YEARS, SON. I AM GONNA BEAT HIM. YOU KNOW THAT. - YOU CAN'T BEAT HIM. WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S NEVER BEEN CAUGHT? - HE'S A DEMON. - AND WHAT DO PEOPLE, ALL PEOPLE, HAVE TO CONFRONT? - [sighs] THEIR DEMONS.

I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE-- - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - THE DARK STRANGER... THAT'S THE BES THEY COULD COME UP WITH. OF COURSE THEY COULDN' DESCRIBE HIM. HOW CAN YOU DESCRIBE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T SEE? IT HAS TO JUSTIFY THE AWFUL DEED IT COMMITTED. THEY COULD NEVER EXPLAIN HIM BECAUSE THEY NEVER TRULY SAW HIM. THEY COULD SENSE HE WAS WITH THEM. BUT HOW CAN THAT BE EXPLAINED? - HE'S NEVER BEEN CAUGH 'CAUSE HE'S ALWAYS THE PERSON YOU'D LEAST EXPECT. - LISTEN, HE'S JUST-- HE'S MESSING WITH YOUR MIND. I MEAN, THIS IS ONE BIG FUCKING NIGHTMARE, OKAY? - [sobbing] THIS ISN'T A NIGHTMARE. - IT'S ALL GONNA BE OVER SOON. IT'S ALL GONNA BE OVER SOON. LISTEN, I NEED YOU HERE, OKAY?

HOW CAN WE BELIEVE THAT DEMONS ARE RIPPING PEOPLE'S SPINES APAR AND CUTTING PEOPLE IN HALF? HOW ARE WE GOING TO BELIEVE YOU? - THERE'S EVIDENCE THERE. - THE TRUTH IS THA YOU HAD A TRAUMA. THE TRUTH IS THA YOU LOST A BABY. YOU LOST PEOPLE YOU LOVE VERY MUCH. AND YOU ARE DEALING WITH I BY FABRICATING ILLUSIONS AND MAKING UP DEMONS. YOUR MIND IS CREATING A REALITY THAT YOU CAN LIVE IN. YOUR WIFE DIED IN CHILDBIRTH, TOM. SHE HEMORRHAGED. THEY ATTEMPTED A C-SECTION... - DEEP BREATHS AND PUSH. - AND IT FAILED. BUT THE MORE YOU LOOK AT THE COLD, HARD FACTS FOR WHAT THEY ARE, THE MORE YOU CAN ACHIEVE CLOSURE... - HONEY, HONEY, HONEY! - REAL CLOSURE. - THIS IS BULLSHIT! MY WIFE DIDN'T DIE IN LABOR. IT WAS HIM. EVERY 100 YEARS, HE FINDS A HOST, AND THAT HOS HAPPENED TO BE MY WIFE. YOU DON'T UNDERS-- NO, AGAIN, I'LL TELL YOU! THE DEMON CAME OU OF MY WIFE'S STOMACH. - TOM, DO YOU REALIZE HOW THIS SOUNDS? - THERE IS A DEMON OUT THERE! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! I TOLD YOU A MILLION FRICKIN' TIMES! ONE MORE TIME, THERE IS A DEMON OUT THERE! HE IS KILLING EVERYBODY! THERE IS A DEMON-- WHERE ARE YOU GOING? YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME NOW! YOU WANTED TO TALK. WE'RE GONNA TALK. THERE IS A DEMON OUT THERE. GET OUT OF HERE! THERE IS A DEMON OUT THERE! I'M TELLING YOU! THERE IS A DEMON! - [roaring] [haunting roaring and wailing] [suspenseful instrumental music]  [dramatic instrumental music]
