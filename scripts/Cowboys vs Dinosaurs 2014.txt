Just keep in mind what's at stake here, possibly the largest deposit of iridium we have ever seen. Geological formation is like nothing else on earth. Well, you've gotta love Mother Nature. She's full of surprises. Keep your techs handy. If anything spikes, do not attempt to remove it yourself. We will send in the extractors. Do I make myself clear? What's with the extra security? It keeps everything honest. We need more diggers, not babysitters. All right, boys, you heard the lady. All right, you apes, let's rock and roll! Warning! Blast preparation underway. Please clear the area. Warning! Blast preparation underway. Please clear the area. - How's it going, Bobby? - A little jammed. All right. All right, hold on for a second. Biggs! - This is Quaid to Sinclair. - Go ahead. We got a drill stuck on the 3400 mark. I don't care. Blow it if you have to. We have a schedule. All right, copy that. I guess we're going to lose the drill. We'll blow it anyway. Move out. You got five minutes to clear it before we go hot, Bobby. Charges! Yeah, that's good. That's good right there. All right, everybody clear out! So what's with this stuff anyway? I don't know. All I know is it pays real good to dig it up. As rare as they come and worth a fortune. I hear it's radioactive. Well, so are some of the women you date. All right, here we go! Fire in the hole! Any traces? Come on, Biggs, check it out. Whole mess of it. And it's hollow in there. Hold on. You mole men are done. Back up to surface. We'll send down the extractors. - Well, I just wanna peek. - You heard me. Yeah, I did, but I'm a little curious. What the hell was that? Hey, you just shot at my friend! Go, go, go! Run, run, run! Get up! Come on, get up! Get up! Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause for the cowboys, and welcome to the 69th Annual Livingston Rodeo. Next up is the golden boy from Big Temple, Montana, pro bull riding champion Val Walker, the hometown hero. You couldn't have bull riding without championship bulls, and Val is riding a beast of an animal named Weatherby. Here we go! There's a hangup! He's taken a terrible fall! Val Walker is down, and he is hurt. Somebody get a bucket because you're gonna need to pick up the pieces of that young man. Look at that. I don't care if you're tougher than owl meat. That was a beating of prehistoric proportions. Ranch must be haunted or something 'cause I think I'm seeing a ghost. Ain't no ghost. Wanna give her a shot? - Come on. Chuy don't buck. - No, I'm fine. Thanks. You got any work up at the ranch? You know, I'd like to hire another hand, but I just can't afford it. - How about the Quartermains? - Doubt it. How long has it been since you been on a horse? Been a while. Heard you were a boat captain or something. No, I was no captain. You could start riding again. There's still some pay money in that. - No, thanks. - Hey, look, don't be sore. If you're gonna stay in town, you can check for work up at the mines. Mines? I ain't no miner. Well, if you can't ride a horse, you sure ain't no cowboy. They had some sort of accident up there the other day. Wade and his boys are working up there. How's the pay? Don't know. I ain't no miner. Hey, look, don't you want to hear about Sky? You know, she still waiting tables in town. - How is she? - Sweet as ever. This is awesome. What are you waiting for? I don't know. What if there's someone that can see us? No one is out here. Everyone has already seen you naked anyway. - Yuck! - Shut up. Let 'em watch. That's what I say. Besides, if we catch any Peeping Toms, we can just tell the old sheriff, right? Come on. - Wait for me. - Okay. - I'm gonna miss this place. - I know. Did you find another spot? It's right here. This little up current in just the right place. Gross! You know you're gonna miss us, Sky. What are you gonna do here without us? Hang out and bone the old sheriff all day? Jonie, shut up already. Who's over there? - Pervert, come out! - There's nobody. Hey, ladies. Oh, it's just Jim. I thought it was a man spying on us. Hey, Sky. Hey, Jim. All right, well, I gotta go, ladies. What? Why? No, actually I do have to go to work, and I don't wanna be late, but call me after. Wait, wait, I'll ride with you. Bye, guys. Don't creep on them like that. What Sky's problem anyhow? You got a problem. Don't talk about her like that. She just hates wild men like you. - I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one? - Heck, yeah. I wasn't talking to you. Hey, the Cowboy's back. How you doing, buddy? Can't complain. Any work here? There was an accident. We think three are dead. What happened? It's real bad. Quaid came up. Something's wrong with him. He's on, ranting, raving about creatures in the mine or something. I take it that means they ain't hiring today. What are you doing back here? Getting something to eat. - I never thought I'd see him again. - Especially after what happened. Oh, my God. Tina! Tina! What the... No! You stop going on about monsters and tell me what happened. A bunch of men went down there, and only you came out. You need to wake up. We let something loose in those mines, and they ain't gonna stop until they eat every single one of us. There's 100 tons of rock collapsed in that mine. The drift is entirely blocked. Do you know how long it's gonna take to get cleared? Mr. Marcus is gonna kill me. He's gonna kill you, too. Then he needs to take a number because if we don't seal off that mine completely, something else will do the job just fine. Do you know how stupid you sound? Completely insane! - Maybe we should consider... - Consider what? That monsters blew up the drift and killed my people? You listen to me, woman! Those are my people, my friends. Now, they may have been on your payroll, but those are my men down there. You understand? What's the call, Sheriff? Boys are getting restless out there. This mine is shut down until further notice. Not for long. Mr. Marcus is on his way. I can cover for you. No, it's fine. He's at one of my tables. What are you having? A cup of coffee... and... and the lunch special. You look good. Coffee and the special. I'll be on break. - Hey. - Hey, baby. Can you come down here? - Why? What's going on? - Actually, Val just showed up. - Val. Val the... - Yeah, that Val. - Look... - Can you please come down here? Okay, look, I'm gonna drop what I'm doing. You stay away from him. Okay. - I'm on my way. You stay in the kitchen. - Okay, I will, I will. - No matter what, don't go near him. - I love you. - Yeah, I love you, too. - Bye, baby. Quaid, you ain't supposed to be down here. It's off limits. The mine is closed. Now, come on! - No, you don't understand. - Quaid, look, I understand. It's a tough thing, but you can't take it personal. John, nobody understands. Quaid, I'm gonna give you time to get over this now. Now, come on, we gotta get out of here. Yeah! John, look at this. It's a piece of flesh. Now look at it. Now, what does it smell like to you? - That smells like... - Yeah, it does. - Now, come on, we gotta get out of here. - Yeah, let's get out of here. Just what the hell you think you're doing, cowboy? Finishing up my steak. You know I'm not talking about a goddamn ribeye. I thought we had ourselves an understanding. You know... she was my girl. Just 'cause you swooped in while I was gone, that doesn't change anything. All right, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna get up and walk out that door to that rusty old truck you got parked in front, and you're gonna get in it and drive till the radiator busts, the head gaskets blow, and the wheels come off, just as far from here as possible... and stay there. You hear me? But I haven't settled my bill yet. Maybe I'm not being clear. That supposed to scare me? No, I already know you're too stupid to be scared. Well, you know I'm not stupid enough to think that you're gonna shoot me here in a diner full of people. Get up and start walking. Have it your way. Are you okay? Don't you ever pull that gun on me again, unless you plan on pulling the trigger. You really screwed up this time, cowboy. You just struck an officer of the law. What are you gonna do? You gonna arrest me? You don't believe that. All right, all right, whatever you need. Right. Good night. - Who was that? - Sinclair. What did she want? I can't make heads or tails of what went on down there. Quaid's always been a little off his rocker. Quaid? But a blast mistake that severe? I just don't see it. Rumors spread fast. The whole town is talking. What? That he unleashed some kind of monster, a dinosaur? Oh, now you don't believe that. Maybe not a dinosaur, but some kind of creature. Oh, like a raptor? Scientists are discovering new things every day. - Raptor! - Stop it. That's not funny. - Raptor! - Stop it. You're not funny. - Stop it! This is not funny! Stop it. - Raptor gonna get you! Stop it. Raptor! Raptor gonna get you. - It's not funny. - We're gonna do it raptor-style. I was there that day when you fell off that bull. We all thought you were gonna die. That's fine. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. - Sounds good. - But what happened to you, anyhow? It was kind of like you just... dropped off the face of the earth. How long am I gonna be in here anyway? Well, Sheriff has his mind set on keeping you here. I'll bet. You're better off behind those bars. He doesn't seem to like you much. Feelings mutual. There's no sense reliving the past. - Tell me what's gonna happen to him. - Don't worry about it. Are you gonna let him go? - Let him go? - Yeah. No. No. He was fool enough to hit me. I'll hold him as long as I can, then ship him up to County once charges are drawn up. Lord knows he can't afford bail. You still care for that boy. After all he did. He hit you. He left you high and dry, and you sit there pining over him. I know, but what happened back then wasn't his fault. Yeah, he got hurt riding. Everybody knows. Golden boy broke his shoulder, fell into drugs and alcohol. Look, everybody gets knocked down once in a while. It's how you handle it, and he didn't handle it. You should've filed charges the first time you had a chance. I'm not gonna let you make that mistake again, all right? Listen to me! Listen! It's not like he's a changed man. He's still the same old Val. Don't do you ever handle me like that! And I will choose how I want to feel about him, okay? Do you got that? Hey, John, let me borrow your methane detector. John, come on, open up. Are you in there? John! Yeah. Put concrete column here, here, here, and here. We'll move all of the equipment. That'll be all. Are you happy with your paycheck, Ms. Sinclair? Yes, sir. Was I not clear about my timetable? Yes, sir, I was perfectly clear. Do you consider yourself to be qualified for this position? The board advised me not to hire a girl out of college. Guess I was wrong. Sir, with all due respect, the situation was out of my control. Control? Control? It is chaotic! Chaos reigns, Ms. Sinclair. I have worked in these mines. I have driven trucks. I have worked my way up to management. Good management does not let this happen. Good management has foresight, Ms. Sinclair! Now... I am bringing this mine back online. I want that iridium extracted by the end of this week. But, sir, that's impossible. Just to clear the rubble for survivors is gonna take months. Plans have changed. You are dismissed. You want some Gothic ranch action? Damn it. Not again. Tell you what. Tell you what. I'm gonna park it. Yeah, boy. Hey, partner, you could use the bucket here. Buckets are good, yeah. Buckets are good. Maybe... just keep it... keep it over there. Yeah, you don't wanna get that too close to you, right? Val Walker. I taught you how to use a phone, didn't I? When d'you get back? Greener pastures ain't always so green, boy? Hey, Pa. Hey, boy. Looking good. Oh, that got it. Can you believe it? Is our... our foreman joining us here for this meeting? Apparently he was attacked by a wild animal in his home last night. - And the sheriff? - He's handling it. I see. Gentlemen. Thank you for coming out. First let me say that we here at Lando Mining, our priority is the safety of our employees. That latest incident has been reviewed by the best minds we can hire. We put in place safety measures so that this cannot happen again. What's happening with the mine? Fine. Then let's get to the meat of the subject, shall we? Before the explosion, the demo team's handhelds were transmitting some very, very interesting data. A hollow space adjacent to the main dig... with traces of iridium like we have never seen before. Just to clarify, the reason why we've chosen the site is the geological formation is without precedent. What about the men? If we access the hollow space from the other side, we can clear a path to look for the men. Clearing that main drift is near impossible. By the time we get rid of all those rocks, those men will have perished. - So now what? - Where's my money? We will blast our way straight down. Is that safe? That's a lot of ordnance for one blast. - Yeah, that's crazy. - And I have safety concerns about that. It's perfectly safe, and the placement will not affect any rescue effort on the other side of the hollow space. Now, this plan has been signed off by my esteemed colleague. She will be putting it into play. Gentlemen, I thank you for coming out. That's it? These rooms here I think are a little small, but I need to move the walls out about six feet. What the hell is going on here? I thought I shut this place down. All right. And I waved my magic wand and opened it again. You could at least pretend I've got some authority around here. Oh, but you do, Henry. You really do. You're a valued member of this operation. By the way, thanks for being at the meeting this morning. Your foreman is dead. Yes, I heard about that bear attack. Wasn't no bear attack. What do you make of this? You sure as hell know that ain't a bear claw. You know what that looks like? Yeah. It looks like a really big claw. It doesn't look like it's from any known living species. Could it be a fossil? It sure as hell isn't a fossil. What the hell is happening out there? You all thought I was crazy. You thought I didn't know what I was talking about. You all thought that old Quaid has lost his marbles. Quaid! Well, boys, feast your eyes! Get down! It's a mountain lion. It's the mountain lion I believe is responsible for the death of the foreman and the attack on the swimmers at Lava Lake. I'm gonna take this in as evidence, your truck. - I'm gonna take you in for questioning. - What? - Sheriff, what the hell is that? - It's just a mountain lion. No. No, I told you what it was. You didn't listen to me. There ain't no mountain lion. - That is a dinosaur! - You trying to cause a panic? You cause a panic in my town, Quaid, and it's gonna be your ass. Henry! You're taking care of this, right? All right, guys, back to work. Those charges need to be set by noon. Get in the truck. - Give me a hand with this thing. - Why? What are you gonna do with it? You gonna put me in a cell with this dead dino carcass? Look, you're right. That thing killed those people, our friends. - Yeah. - But you need to get in line. There's bigger things in play, and this is my town. Give me a hand. Can't just leave it in the back of your pickup. Why not? I killed this thing. - Yeah, you got a permit? - What? - Didn't think so. - For a dinosaur? Yeah, I hate to see you locked up on poaching charges. Look, I don't know what protocol is for something like this, - but letting you keep it sure ain't it. - All right. - Give me a hand. - Fine, fine! - Watch it! - Or what? What else can happen to it? You are really getting on my nerves. How'd you kill it? See, I tracked this thing with a methane detector. Found a piece of skin in the back of the mine. Smelled of sulfur and gas. It looked... It looked like it crawled through the rubble. - How many of them are there? - Oh, there was plenty... but I lost count. I lost count when they started eating all my friends. All right, look, I'll go back to the mine, I'll talk to Marcus, get the demo shut down. It's gonna be the end of this town, though. All right, here we go. Charges are set. Fire in the hole! He was right. It's completely hollow. All right, boys, let's get some excavators up in there and clean her out. Sinclair, airport. Now! We're too late. Damn it. Gotta get back to the mine, see what happened, okay? All right, I'll check with County and meet you back there. Get ahold of County and see if they felt anything. Sheriff, you're not gonna believe this, but... the line's flooded with animal attack reports. - What? - From all over the place. I don't know what to make of it. Hey, Pa, come on, get up. Something's going on. The grid's completely out. What do we do? Look, just keep trying to get the line back up. Stay on your walkie. Wait... We gotta get out of here. - Where the hell are you going? - Hunting. Hey... will you check on Sky? - Will you make sure she's okay? - Boy, she's none of your damn business. Look, Henry, you gotta get me out of here. I can help. The last thing I need is a hothead running around town. Come on, Henry! Let him help you. You must be out of your mind. Hey, Henry. Hen... What did she mean by animal attacks? You know how to use one of these things? Yeah. Good girl. How are we gonna explain this? Look, just get me out of this town if you know what's good for you, Sinclair. What the... Oh, my God. Go. Go! Funny thing is this is probably the safest place as any. Animal attacks? Come on, man. You need to relax, son. You can't do nothing from in here. I need to get out of here. I gotta check on Sky. Sky. - What happened to you that day? - What do you mean? You know what happened. I got bucked, had a wreck. - I got stomped. - Not that day. - You mean the day I left? - Yeah, that day. - What happened to you? - You wanna talk about this now? Come on. - Talk to me. - I got angry, and I panicked. - You panicked. - She was putting me out. I was gonna lose her. I was gonna lose everything. I messed up. Messed up. "I messed up!" That don't work, boy. I was hoping you'd learned something in your travels. You know... you can forgive yourself. She bound to be able to forgive you someday. Think about it. I don't know if I can forgive myself. Well, then how the hell could she? You know, I've been... I've been running for so long and for so far, I forgot what I was running from. You know, it wasn't Sky, it wasn't you. It was myself. You know what these are? The smallest violins playing the saddest song in the world. I love you, boy. I need a drink. I don't like this shit at all. Can anyone see out the window? What are you doing, Sinclair? Oh, God. Val, be still. That thing is still in here, man. What are you doing? He's gonna get in here, Val. Val! Do not open the door. Not cool. Val... Val, this is not safe in here, man! - Oh, good grief. - You coming? Man, an old drunk ain't gonna be no help to you, buddy. Don't leave with the keys. Don't leave with the keys. Val, go get her. Oh, this is not fun. This is not fun. Run! Go. Don't stop. I want no stops. I want you to get me to the airport now... Oh, my God. Well done, dear boy. Well done. Now, either one of you care to explain what the hell is going on? Well? Don't look at me. Ask the resident expert here. I'm just a simple businessman. Don't you dare point the finger at me. I told you not to order the blast, and you did it anyway. I think you have it all wrong, my dear. You signed the blast order, not me! - Don't you dare point... - Hey. That is not gonna help anything! You are finished! - I am not finished! - Stop! All right, shut up! Joe, I want you to shore up this door with everything you've got. Who put you in charge? You got a better idea? Sky, you okay? - Yeah. - All right, come on, let's go. - No, I can't, I can't. - You can, okay? Come on, we gotta go. No. What are those things? What's happening? I don't have a reasonable explanation for it, but I'm telling you this, we gotta go, and we gotta go now. 'Cause they're gonna come back. Can't we just use a phone in the restaurant, and we can call for help? The phones are dead. - Wait, you came back here for me? - I did. Why would you do that? What choice did I have? I had to make sure you were safe. We need to call the sheriff. He'll know what to do. There's a CB in the storeroom, and we can contact him on that, okay? Let's go. Come on. You. Yes, you. What's your name? Quaid. My name's Quaid. Right. Quaid. So, Quaid, you got a vehicle near here? Yeah. She's out the diner, a few blocks up. All right. If you can get your truck down here, Quaid, I'll give you any amount of money that you want. Within reason, of course. A million bucks. Million bucks. All right, a million bucks. You get your truck back here, and I will give you a million dollars. You old wrinkly bag of dung. You know good and well that going out these doors is suicide. And what's a human life worth to you? - A million bucks? - Hell, I'll do it for a million bucks. No, you won't! Ain't no one gonna stick their neck out for this jerk. I told you. I told you what was down there, and you didn't listen. And now you're gonna pay for it in this life or the next. Hello? Hello, can anyone hear me? Hello? Over. Hello. Val, things are never gonna be the way that they were. I don't want them to be the way they were. Well, is this what you imagined coming back here? Hello. Hello, can anyone hear me? Hello? Over. Sky, honey, is that you? - Henry! - Sky, are you there? Yes, Henry, it's me. Hi, hey. - God, baby, are you all right? - Yes. I'm at the diner, and I'm with Val. - Are you hurt? - No, nothing serious. - Henry, what happened? - The whole town's under attack. Something came out of the mine. Is your location secure? Give me that. Henry, this is Val. Our location is severely compromised. Okay, we gotta go. How's your location? It's not good. We're... We're getting low on ammo, and those things have us completely surrounded. Is that Val Walker? The Val Walker? Let me talk to him, Henry. I know him. Come on. - Val, is that you? - Yeah. Who is this? It's Quaid. You remember me? - We worked together as hands for Lou. - Yeah, Quaid. How you doing? I've seen better days, friend. Look, we're in a real pickle down here at the bar. What's your location? - I'm at the... I'm at the diner with Sky. - Is there anyone left alive? Doesn't look like it. Okay, this is what I want you to do. I want you to go out of the back of the diner. Look to the left of the alley. You're gonna see my orange pickup truck. You can't miss it. Now, underneath the driver's seat is a kill switch. Look at the column, and you'll see the black and red wire. Now, you just rub 'em together, okay? You rub 'em together. And you and Sky, you get the hell out of here. Don't try to play hero. You got me? No! No! He comes here, and he picks me up. The minute they stop, those things will mob him. What's your situation like? We'll manage. Just go for help. Here. You made your bed, and now you can die in it. I'm sorry. Cover me. You can do this, okay? Val. Val! We gotta hurry. Val, let's go! Come on, Val, hurry! Let's go! Kill switch! That's it. Val, there's nobody here. Come on. Those boys ain't gonna make it the next hour without some help. Nearest town's four hours away. Where did all this come from? Quaid. He's an anarchist at heart. You know, I bet he's actually enjoying this in a way. How can you joke like that? Like what? Like what? Like that. Half the town's dead, Val, and you're cracking jokes. - This ain't no joke. - No, it's not. You're a joke. You're the real joke, Val. Do you honestly think that you're just gonna cowboy up and ride into town guns a blazing? They said to get help. Yeah, and you're real inclined to listen to that sheriff, ain't ya? Why did you leave me? What is wrong with you? Three years, and you just come waltzing back? What did you honestly think was gonna happen here? What? What? I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you, Val! I hate you! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What are you up to? Blood is a carrier for oxygen in us human beings, but in these reptiles that have been living underground... if you're right... they've had to adapt to thriving on methane. Their blood is carrying gas, methane, propane. Okay, what's your point? Well, their Achilles Heel would be where blood is in its highest concentration. The brain and the heart. Smart. All right, Joe, get her a bottle of high proof alcohol, whiskey, - and some rags from the bar. - Okay. - How much ammo you got left? - 10, 12 rounds. Good. Look, it's a straight shot from here to the station, and you've got some other cars back there, right? Right? Yeah. My deputy's car should be there, but my deputy should still be there. Good. All right, this is the plan. They got a big PA system over here. I'm gonna work my way over there, figure out how to switch it on, then when the time's right, we're gonna blast a lot of music out there, then we're gonna hightail it out of here back to the station, okay? Look, we are going to find your girlfriend, then get out of here. What about the rest? I had something like this happened in Belize. Look, it's... it's like this. There's a ton of iridium in that mine. Now, anyone that helps me now or in the future stands to be very, very rich. Unfortunately, there is going to be some collateral damage, but it won't be us. Okay? Okay. Remember, stay inside and you lock the doors. Fuel line's tore out. You're history. Do you hear that? - Maybe it's help on the way. - Yeah. That don't sound like help to me. Something's coming. Focus all your attention right down the middle. Brace yourselves. They're getting close. Who turned on the music? Marcus! Marcus, wait! Unbelievable. Hurry up with that thing! - Joe! Joe! No! Joe! - Oh, no. Move it up. We've got to get ourselves to higher ground. You got any incendiaries, tracers, flares, anything like that? Val, it's the gas. They light up like fireworks if you hit 'em right. - There's some at the sheriff's station. - Okay, let's go. Hold on. I'll go get them. You guys head out, get to higher ground. I'll meet you at the grain elevator. Leave those tracers to me. Come on! Well, I'll be damned. He is back. Yo! Come on! Come on, doggie! All right. Let's go! Come on! Oh, my God. Keys. Where are the keys? Damn it. All right, now keep your sights open and shoot anything that crawls. We're gonna secure this doorway for Val. Where's that goddamn heliport? I know it's around here somewhere. What... Hello. Can you hear me? Hello! Not bad? - You guys okay? - Yeah, yeah. All right, let's move to the high ground. Go. Help me with this. We're surrounded. All right, everybody, focus all your fire on this door! Wait! Sky, are you in there? Henry! You don't think I know what happened back there at the bar? It was Marcus. It was his idea. I went after him. And? He's dead. He took the deputy's car, and he's dead. What about Sinclair? - I assumed she was with you. - No. Well, I assume that she's dead 'cause she ain't with us. We're gonna die in here. - We're gonna take this town back. - How? My horse, some ATVs outside, and propane tanks. We rig 'em up, lead those dinosaurs back to the mine they came from. Some of us will set up on top of the crater rim and pick them off with the tracers one at a time as they come in. Yeah. I got a few surprises for them at the mine. Might come in handy. Yeah. You and the sheriff's as good a shot as any. It won't work. There are too many. We got a stockpile of ammo, propane tanks. We rig it up and draw them away. - What makes you think they'll follow? - Oh, they love that stuff. - Round 'em up. - Just like cattle. Cattle that could eat you, all right? We stay right here, we wait for help, end of story. No. We're as good as dead if we stay here. This is how it's gotta be! Listen, I'm the sheriff. What I say is the law. Are you kidding me? These walls are hollow. There's more of them coming up. You didn't lock the door behind you? We need to sit tight and wait for help. Yeah, look who's talking. Sit tight? You ran and left us for dead. If not for Val, we'd all be ripped to shreds. Now, we need to get out of here, and now! Come on, Val, obstruct this door. He's not a changed man. You know that. - You still love him. - Henry... How's it looking? Bad. We gotta find another way out of here. Let's go. I'll cover the door. They'll be coming up these floorboards. Go help them. I'll hold the door. Don't you even mess with me, son. I got this. Go. Look, I'll shoot you. You know I would. Go! No! I'm sorry. Where's Quaid? What? Y'all looking for these? Let's do this. Let's do it. Quaid, open the tank! - Yeah! - Come on! Move out! Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna sit up over there on that ridgeline. Gonna leave these propane tanks here. I'll bring them to the canyon. I got a little something for them. You sit there and pick 'em off one by one. Here we go, baby. Yeah! Get some! Come on, get some! Get some! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! No! It's over. It's okay, baby. It's the other shoulder. I'm so sorry that I hurt you. You saved me. No, darling. You saved me.
