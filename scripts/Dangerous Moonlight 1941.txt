HE CONTINUES TUNELESS PLAYING SHE HUMS TUNE Is he still the same? Yes, she's singing to him now. I couldn't do the blackout. I hope he stops soon. I have three nights' sleep to make up. I hope it's quiet tonight. Bombers and now him. To think they once paid to listen to him! It must be awful, not to know who you are. He's lucky to be alive. What good is it if you don't know who you are? Only bits of the plane were left. He's not even scarred. He's very good-looking. Not my type. What is your type? Sister, have you been in No.14? Yes, Doctor. How is he? About the same, no change. Leave your things here. We'll see him later. Is that the new specialist? It must be. You can see the papers on him. That darn piano! He'll drive away all my patients. How long has it gone on? Three days. I gave it to him the day you suggested it. I think it's the way. In Philadelphia, children were cured by giving them their old toys. This piano is much the same. I must say I thought it would work. But he doesn't seem to want to get better. He doesn't give us any help at all. Just sits there staring round the room. Thanks. 9 o'clock nearly. Time for the news. BANGING ON KEYS Just listen to him. Stefan Radetzky, the great Polish pianist in one of his own original compositions. I've often heard him play. If we could cure him, I'd feel we'd done something for the world. Something for... Well, you know what I mean. If you feel like that too, we'll get him better. Even if it takes a miracle or an act of God. I just don't want to see another great artist finish up in a home. Let's carry on for another day or two, then discuss it and perhaps try something else. All right. HE PLAYS "The Warsaw Concerto" RADIO: This is the BBC Home Service. Switch off the wireless, quickly! What's the matter? The lights too. HE PLAYS CONCERTO CONFIDENTLY Know what it is? That music? His Warsaw Concerto. I've got the records. This may be the miracle we were talking about. It may. I'd like to see it. Come on. Perhaps that music will bring back a lot of things. I hope so. I'd like to know what he's thinking about now. MUSIC RISES TO CRESCENDO SCREAMS MUSIC CONTINUES GENTLY MUSIC CONTINUES It's not safe to be out alone when the moon is so bright. Can someone tell the Germans? They didn't hear. Oh, them? They never fly alone. Come in, please. Close the door. Don't worry about me. I'm harmless. I wonder. I'm just playing to myself. It soothes my nerves. Like David and King Saul. You move in the very best circles, I hear. I've played before all the crowned heads of Europe, all three of them. You look lovely. American? Psychic? Or is it just this voice of mine? Your voice, my lady, is music. Music as lovely as my own. Your own? Did you write that? Uh-huh. It's good. Oh, it's better than that. BOMB EXPLODES Is this your house? No. Isn't it yours? No. I just saw the piano and came in through the window. I just heard the piano, but I came in through the door. Women have such dignity. Whenever I break into houses, I have to be unconventional. Sometimes... You don't have to talk this nonsense. I'm not scared. No, I don't think you are. We try to amuse women so they won't think about the war. I wish I were half as brave as the women in Warsaw. What are you doing here anyway? This isn't your war. Newspaper. Oh. Which one? The New York Monitor. Don't forget to tell them what you've seen. I won't forget. Don't you worry. Who are you, though? What uniform is that? Flyer. Flyer? Why are you here? Why aren't you up there stopping them killing people, instead of just playing the piano? I like playing the piano. You could pick a better time. Now, listen, young woman. I don't like talking about these things but you asked for it. I've been in the air nine hours today already. Fighting real aeroplanes, not bits of wood and string like we use. You wouldn't know we've been out of petrol for nearly 10 days now. We have to send children into the streets to steal it from cars lying about. Out of my whole squadron, only two men are left. And you talk about them like that. Now go back home and write a lovely article all about the sufferings of Warsaw. They'll pay you well. I'm sorry. I didn't understand. Forget it. HE PLAYS Thank you. Is this your job? Struggling composer? I don't struggle very hard, though. Lazy? Sometimes. But tonight, I suddenly got the idea for this music. That's as far as I've got. Inspiration lacking, that's what it is. Perhaps. Tell me about yourself. Oh, an interview? All right. BOMBS EXPLODE I got born at an early age. Became a man. Handsome, full of charm. Great musician. I think that's about all. You left out modest. Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. I'll tell you about you now. Born in California, with a brother and six sisters. No mother, millionaire father, drinks heavily. Am I right? Well, apart from the fact that I'm from New York, have no brothers or sisters and adore my mother, yes. You mean he IS a millionaire? Yes, but he can't help it. No brothers, no sisters? Lady, will you marry me? He's not as rich as all that. Oh. Then I'd better stick to my music. You know, you really should. You're darn good. Why don't you try and give a concert? That's a good idea. Perhaps I will one day. Please don't go. Not after the love you've just given me. Please. PLANES APPROACH MUSIC ON RADIO: "Polonaise No.1" by Frederic Chopin Found it yet? I think so, in Romania. That's where you're to go. You mean me, sir? There'll be four of you altogether. Two I know, the others will draw for it. Who's the other one? Radetzky. The other men want me to get him away. You go with him. Radetzky should go, but I don't see why I should. I'm no great pianist, as far as I know. You're not being sent away for that, don't you worry. I'd still rather take my chances here. I've got your orders. That's all. Besides, there'll be enough misery in Poland before long. Without you adding to it. You can be sure of that. I'm sorry for being difficult. Here are all your instructions. Land in Romania. One day we'll use the planes again. I'll try. You look after things, he's not very practical. My own mother wouldn't call me practical, but I'll try. And try not to look so depressed. We're grateful to you, even if we don't say so. "Polonaise No.1" I won't waste your time. You know why we are here. While that music goes on, Warsaw still holds out. But at midday, it will stop. The Mayor has asked for a truce. Before then, however, two squadrons of bombers will pay a last call on the headquarters of the German Third Army. Each plane has enough petrol to get there. Like this, twice as many can go. I shall want 23 volunteers to accompany me. No married men, because it's a one-way journey. Those who will come with me, take one step forward. Stupid children. But I might have guessed. Roshinsky, you're married, aren't you? "Polonaise No.1" And you, Hapner? And you, Piazesetsky. I know you are married. I was afraid of that. So I wrote out some numbers for you to draw. There are also four men needed to take the new planes to Romania. Now, all of you draw a slip and go over to Topolski. He'll tell you if you've won a prize. "Polonaise No.1" You stay. Bomber. Bomber. Romania. You stay. Bomber. Romania. You stay. You for Romania as well? Mm-hmm. I'm Mike Carroll. You the pianist fellow? Yes, I suppose I am. Better get our things ready and get out of here. They'll be here in a few hours. "Polonaise No.1" We'll never keep together. I'll meet you at the consulate. Keep south-east. Can you manage it? I think so. I wish I was sure of the rest. I don't want to be interned. I won't be. I'm a neutral, I hope. Why are you here? Irish, the last of the Wild Geese. We always fought in other countries. Usually against the English. I can't stay in Romania. There go the last. One-way trip. They're a good bunch of boys. We'd better get cracking. Jerry'll be here soon. See you there. I'll be back one day. One day I'll be back. Well, New York's the same anyway. Why shouldn't it be? It's a change to see somewhere peaceful. It's journey's end anyway. What's worrying you? I'm not worried. One of your blasted moods. It's a cheerful way to start a concert tour. A lovely six-month holiday and you complain. It wasn't my idea. I'd feel happier on the other side. Pick up the joining-up forms at the Polish embassy. When are the reporters coming? I hate interviews, I feel like a freak. You are in a way - composer, pianist, airman. I said don't mention my flying, but De Guys was thinking of business. After a three-month tour, we come back to New York for the final concert. Gentlemen, remember that all the proceeds go to charity. I heard he used to be an airman. It's a good story, if it's true. I don't know how you heard this! Monsieur Radetzky is here as a pianist. Please say nothing about his flying activities. But see that it, er, leaks out quietly. OK. What's he been doing since Poland got taken over? I have prepared for that. "After six months, Stefan Radetzky escaped the hardship and horror of an internment camp in Romania." You seem very sure he's the guy you met in Warsaw. I am. A Polish pianist who's an ace pilot, it must be him. Will he remember you? Of course. You wait and see. Come on, step on it, will you? Steward, where's Mr De Guys? He's over there. Say, he'd make a swell Thanksgiving dinner. "To journey across mountains through snow and ice." He makes Stanley and Livingstone sound like amateurs. Let's find your pal. None of these guys look like piano players. Who are they? I don't know. Ah, so that's the guy. Is this your first trip? First since the war. Find it different? Not yet. Hold it. No... Hello, Carol. Mr Radetzky, Carol Peters, Buck Cooper. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. How do you do? Cigarette? No thanks. How was Warsaw when you left? It was still Warsaw, in a way. Thanks, Mr Radetzky. I'll be off. Same with me. Goodbye. Couldn't have forgotten you, eh? Doesn't talk much, does he? Not like musicians I know. You don't seem to like this much. Not very much. I don't blame you. We ask such intimate questions. Here come some more. Would you like a drink? I'd love one. Hey! Hold it, boys. Give the kid a break. Did you have any adventures in Warsaw? Any excitement? No. Have you composed anything lately? I did start a concerto once but - Don't believe a word, lady. Glory be. I'm Mike Carroll. THE Mike Carroll. I'm Carol too. Carol Peters. We're practically related. Have hundreds of people told you you're lovely? Thousands. Too bad. Promise not to go away. Promise now. I promise. I suppose he is a friend of yours? Yes. But there ought to be a law against men like him. It's not safe to have them around. It's not safe to be out alone when the moon is so bright. So that's where...! Yes. Last fall. I knew we'd meet again. Somewhere. Some day. I've thought about you so much. I even prayed that nothing would happen to you. I've thought about you too. A lot. Yet when we meet again, you don't recognise me. Well, you had a hat like that and... Six months ago. It was very dark. Think you'll know me next time? We can always meet in the dark. When do we try? Tonight? Oh, I can't. I'm working. What about tomorrow? What time does it get dark in New York? About 8. There you are. You left my heart in pieces. He tells that to all the girls. My intentions are honourable. Unlike some. Where will we have dinner tonight? Just the two of us. Not tonight. Don't pass me up for a pianist. I won't take a no. You won't get yes either. The ingratitude. Oh, sharper than the serpent's tooth. How about tonight? I've got a much better idea. Both of you come to dinner tomorrow night. I've got theatre seats and there's a party at 8. 8 o'clock. I'd love to, but I'm afraid I can't. I've got a...reporter coming to see me then. Oh, good. You'd only be in the way. Tomorrow night, then. Goodbye. HE HUMS You'd better get a move on. What time is it? After 8 already. I'll be late again. My coat's hanging on the floor. Certainly, sir. My, even your best friend won't smell you. Chloroform? You lug, it's very expensive. I know. I bought it. What would I do without you? Sure you won't come? Far too busy. Got your keys? Yes. Where's my hat? Next door. In the bathroom? No, you fool, in here. Here you are. Would I pass for a gentleman? If it's dark enough. You do know it's 8:10? Why didn't you say so? Be good. I'll give your love to Carol. Bye. DOORBELL RINGS Can I come in? Or do I stay here? How did you get in? Was the door open? The darling Irishman it was. He ran straight past me in the corridor. Just as well, or I'd have had a lot to explain. Lovely dress you're wearing. Thank you, sir, she said. Like a drink? I'd love one. Thank you. To your health. (SHE TOASTS IN POLISH) How lovely to hear that again. Thank you. Don't you feel guilty deceiving an honest man like Mike? Or have you no conscience? Yes, I have. How's yours? Pretty good. But I'm glad he was in a hurry. And all for you. You seemed in a bit of a hurry. All for me too? Mm-hm. Eating in, are we? Yes, if you don't mind? I've had no time to unpack my evening things. Much nicer. As a matter of fact, it's not true. My evening things are hanging up, but this is nicer. A plot, you see? Same here. I only dressed up because I thought you'd like it. Might think I looked nice. WAITER CLEARS HIS THROA Dinner is served. Wow! I think you were right when you said it was a plot. I never thought he'd enter into the spirit of it like that. It wasn't as funny as that, was it? No, I was thinking of Mike. I hope he's all right. Why? What have you done? I got a girl to look after him. She's a man-eater. She'll never eat a man again after Mike. You'll see. Oh. Wish hard. I always wanted to do something, and when the war started, I offered to go to Warsaw for the Monitor if they gave me a job when I got back. I got the job, and now I cover business conventions and interview celebrities. A bit of a come-down after war correspondent. I start at the top and work my way down. It's easy. You're lucky to be back here. So are you. Glad you came? In a way, yes. I didn't want to, but I had to. Mike came as my manager. I'm glad you didn't leave him. I'd be interned in Romania but for him. It's nice to have such friends. If you can find them. It's funny. When I saw you together yesterday, you seemed like children. But tonight, you're all grown up. It's much easier to behave like that. It helps you forget. The things we saw weren't very funny. I saw them too. You know how I feel, then. We're starting an air force. After this, I'll go back. Back? Yes, Mike's coming too. I think you're both crazy. How can you say that? But you. You of all people shouldn't be allowed to... Allowed what? Nothing. Gosh, the time. It can't be right. Don't ask me. I don't know what day it is. Quarter to 12. Gosh, I'm late. Must you go, Cinderella? I have to get to the office early. I'll lose my job if I'm late again. What did I do with my bag? I've got it here. I'm sorry I have to run away. You always seem to be running away from me. Yes. I really am sorry. When can I see you again and where? Six months' time, maybe. In the dark. Oh, no. Not again like that. Next time it might be too dark. We might both pass by and never know it. Oh, my darling. It's been so long. You can't ever go away from me now. I won't, ever again. Carol. Will you marry me? Marry you? You asked me once before. This time I mean it. Will you? Yes, please. You see, I'm awfully old-fashioned. How soon can we get married? My, you're in a hurry! You have to be. There's a war on. DANCE MUSIC Shhh. Wait here, darling. I'll get some things. I'll only be one minute. You go read the books. You can read? Only the easy words. Darling, say goodbye. Say thank you. Thank you. Oh, hello. I didn't know there was anybody here. Have you come to take somebody home? Yes, I have, sir. You're a smart boy not to have come to it yourself. These darn parties get my goat. Me too. Take the other one off. Much more comfortable. Good idea. I don't see why I put the darn things on anyway. Should have had sense enough to sneak out, like Carol. Smart girl, Carol. Even if she has gone out with some hungry musician. Would you like a drink? Maybe a small one. Well... Hello, Daddy. Hello. I suppose you know Stefan. We haven't been properly introduced. It's all right. I'm Bill Peters, Carol's father. I'm Stefan Radetzky. You mean...? Yes, but I'm not hungry, only thirsty. Oh, sure. I was pouring you one when Carol came in. What is this big secret you boys have got? I just said you'd gone out with some hungry musician. Meaning him. He's all right, though. Even if he does play music. But what have you got your coat for? Where are you kids off to? Maybe we ought to tell him. Well, as a matter of fact, Daddy... We're married. Married? Since when? An hour ago. If you don't mind. How long have you known each other? I met him in Warsaw months ago. Oh, please, Daddy. Don't be angry. I know what I'm doing. I know, honey. I know. But why didn't you come and tell me? There's no need for any secrets. I know... I just sneaked off to see him for a minute and... We suddenly decided to get married. I just had to! I love him. Oh, please, Daddy. All right, all right. You're married, so what are we arguing about? You'll please forgive this little family argument. You understand? Don't worry about me. Well, he looks a nice guy anyway. So long as you're happy, I am too. Say, does your mother know about this? No. Anyone see you come in? Only Bates. He won't talk. I'll get you out. Where's the car? Down the side. The window will be safer. Where will you go? To the shack. Swell idea. Easy now. Now get along, you kids. Don't mention this to your mother, or my life won't be worth a dime. Goodbye, Carol. If you want anything, ring me at the office. God bless you. Take care of yourself. Bye, Dad. Goodbye, son. Take care of her, boy. She's a great kid. I know. Goodbye. God bless you both. Crazy kids. You call this a little way out of the city? It's 100 miles. It's not that far the way I drive. True. Well, what are we waiting for? I'm waiting for you to carry me across the threshold. What? You just carry me across. It's quite easy. With your weight? Oh, no, madame. You have to! Really. It's an old superstition. I know a Polish one. If ever you sneeze... Sweetheart, tell me your dreary story later. It's cold, and I don't intend to walk through that door. Please be kind to a sentimental wife. The word wife is music to my ears. For that I carry you. Even if I'm making a fool of myself. I bet we look darn silly. Oh. Some shack, this. HE PLAYS THE WEDDING MARCH Oh, darling, not that. Can't you think of anything more suitable? You want something more sentimental. What about this? HE PLAYS "Liebestraum" by Franz Liszt Why, Miss Carol, I'm real sorry. I thought you weren't coming. So I went to bed. Stefan, I want you to meet Uncle Joel. Uncle Joel, this is my husband. Proud to know you. How do you do? Is everything OK? No excitement? Not much, except that piano. Oh, yes... I had to bust down the door this morning... Put the car away. We'll be up soon. Busting the door down... SHE HUMS Ah-hem. So the piano only arrived this morning. Cutting it fine. I don't know what you mean. I had to have a present for the bridegroom. It looks to me as if I never had a chance. I've been trapped all along. Where is he?! Where is he?! Mon Dieu! What sort of a staff have I got? You may all go, unless you find Radetzky! You may all go. Oh, it is too much... Find him! Find him! Hello, is Stefan Radetzky there? Stefan Radetzky? We'd like to know. We're in a flat spin. The concert's been pushed forward and we can't find him. Mr De Guys is frantic. Too bad you're frantic, De Guys. To disappear like this is unbelievable! I know where he might be. He's always with that Peters girl. Hello. Oh. That's what I call real thoughtful. Just part of my Continental charm. Thank you. You love me? Mm-hmm. Love me? How far are we going to walk? Ooh, a long way. A mile? Oh, much further than that. I can't walk that far! PHONE RINGS Who can that be? No-one knows we're here. Joel's out. So are we. But it might be important. Come on! It might be Daddy. I won't be a minute. I know! Hello. Hello, Mike. What are you doing there? How are you? I'm fine. I'm married. Stefan? He's fine. He's married too. Yes, we're both married. Married? What is this? Who is married? Whom have you married? What is that you say? Radetzky married? That is not a way for Stefan to treat me. Please tell him that he must come back at once! Get flowers for Madame Radetzky. Flowers? You want a...wreath? A wreath! You must learn to speak English proper! A bouquet, not a wreath. Chere madame, please tell your husband that the tour now opens the day after tomorrow. But he can't possibly come back today. SHE SIGHS All right. Tomorrow at the earliest. OK, and not a minute before. We'll be at your office tomorrow at eleven. This marriage is not a happy conception. I want to tell Stefan they're forming a Polish air squadron in England. I'll be called up soon. I have a form for Stefan. Oh, Mike! That means he'll... I knew something like this would happen. Look, Mike, will you please do something for me? Please don't tell him anything about it yet. We're on our honeymoon. And after all, he's much more use to Poland over here. Stefan's coming. I must hang up. Yes, please. Thank you. Goodbye. I'll get frozen hands, and won't be able to play any more. What's the matter? It was De Guys. He wants you to go back. The concert opening has been put forward. I said you couldn't go till tomorrow. Oh, something like that would happen. Never mind. Forget about it for today. Today! It's such a little time. Will you promise me something? Come back the first night after the tour's over. Of course, darling, I promise. How was it De Guys got the number? Mike was there. I told him we were married. How did he take it? He just said, "What?" What, that's all? Uh-huh. Then De Guys came on the phone. PIANO PLAYS Remember this? I woke up suddenly, and it all came back to me. I just had to come down before I lost it again. Darling, you were so lovely on the stairs just then. You almost stopped my heart. This is your melody. It's beautiful. You gave it to me. I'll never play it again without thinking of you. Without you deep in my heart. How are you going to end it? Happy, I hope. Hope? You are joking. What's the matter? Nothing. It's just the music. What do you mean? This music is you and me. It's the story of the two of us in Warsaw, of us in America, of us in... Where else I don't know. That's why I can't finish it. Darling, you mustn't dispel all my illusions. Illusions? I thought composers wrote under the throes of inspiration. Not always. Most of it is just plain hard work, like any other job. It's funny, you know, darling - I know so little about you. In a way, we're two strangers. But it won't stop us from being happy, will it? Of course not. We'll always be happy. Always and always. If you have to be miserable with your funny Continental ways... Just leave it to me. I'll see to that. How sweet you are, and how young. How soon you seem to have forgotten what's happening in the world. No, I haven't, but please don't think about that now. I can't help it, darling. It's inside me. That's why I wish I hadn't time to think, like when I was a flyer. How do you mean? I can't explain it. But when I was a flyer, it felt like being in another world. There's something so cold and clean up there, and so beautiful too. You come out of the darkness of the clouds into clear, bright sun. Underneath are the tops of the high mountains. You're high above them all. Sometimes at night you can almost touch the stars. You feel you belong with them. You almost forget that you're fighting a war. It seems so far away. Miles and miles below you. I'm cold. It must be getting late too. Oh, I'm so sorry, darling. Why didn't you tell me? I just suddenly felt cold. I come from a long line of martyrs. I hope it'll be fine tomorrow. So do I. I've got to drive back. Oh, look, there's a strange thing. What? In the sky up there. You mean those two stars together in the sky? Yes. Star and falling star. Something that happens every 200 years to those two up there. They start together in the sky, and then move apart. But in the end they just have to come together again. Like they are now. What a lovely idea. Star and falling star. That is my last word. Oh, but this is wonderful! You are so early it is not believed. I am so happy for you both. Flowers, flowers. For madame, some flowers. Thank you. Your husband has fooled me. It is for him habitual to be four hours late, so I've arranged no rehearsal. I go fix one. Bon. Come. See what marriage has done for you? Punctuality has done no good. Half an hour too early. They told me you were here. How you can look me in the eye, stealing the girl I love! Good morning. Continental, you see? Good morning. How nice to see you again. She cares for me still. As for you, words fail me. First time that happens to an Irish man. Ingratitude! I must be civil to him if I intend to see a lot of his wife. You did marry her, I suppose? I'm surprised at you, putting ideas in his head. Of course we're married. Not in church yet. We have to wait till you can be best man. Then I can kiss the bride? Yes. I'd better practise. Wait till we are in church. That's where I'm being sent. I did it yesterday. It kept you out of trouble anyway. What else did you do? I meant to tell you. I was going to yesterday... Go on. Or do you have to whisper? Was it about the girl? We can't tell him now. He's a married man. Stefan, you can practise as much as you please. Thanks. It gives me time to change. Can you drop me? Certainly. See you later. Oh, my flowers. Here you are. Thanks so much, Mike. That's all right. Thank you. It sounds silly, but it's how I feel. I'm not one of these big-hearted women you read about. What have they got to do with it? I'd love to say, "Do what you want so long as you're happy." But I can't. I'm not big enough. Take it from me - if he wants to go, you can't stop him. Maybe I can. How? I want to make his life so happy here, maybe he'll never want to go back. Maybe. Besides, he's done enough already. He... Oh, Daddy, you look so serious! I don't know why. You know, I think you're imagining things. Maybe he doesn't even want to go. I hope so. I must go. I've got to get back to him. He starts his tour in the morning. Goodbye, Carol. Funny-looking things? They can say much more than I can in words. I'm like a man who is riding two horses at the same time. I'll be back one day. One day I'll be back. I got it all fixed up to tell you. I just didn't. Didn't we plan to go together? We talked about it. It was just talk? Why are you getting excited? You do a better job here. Why didn't you say you were going weeks ago? Did Carol put you up to this? Carol? No. You're a bad liar, Mike. Why not tell me the truth? I didn't want to influence you. I thought by this time you'd be seeing sense. I get the idea. What you mean is gone soft. Do you really think I'm going to stay behind? You must be crazy. You'll be late for your concert. I packed your evening things. What's the matter? He's gone off the deep end because I'm going to England. He's got an idea he must come too. Can't you talk some sense into the man? Why did you tell Mike to keep it a secret? Because I didn't want you to go too. You needn't look at me like that. I'm not ashamed. I'd do it again if necessary. I wish you wouldn't get at my friends behind my back. It'd save a lot of trouble. Don't start a brawl. It's my last night. It doesn't suit you. Poor Michael, you look so unhappy. Here, let me help you. This is where you need a woman's hand. Mike, you do not pack shoes with shirts. It's so bad for the shoes. I forgot. Come and see me before you go. Like the Prodigal Son on my bended knees, begging forgiveness. Fool. I'm sorry, my landing you in a spot like this. That's all right. I'm used to it. Always in trouble. Mike, you're the end. It'll be the first time in my life to catch a train without running. After all you told me about what Cromwell did to your ancestors, and what you think of the English, isn't it funny to fight for them? I don't mind the Irish taking a crack at them. When someone else butts in, it's different. We must preserve them so we have someone to fight when the war's over. You probably feel the same about Stefan. Why are you so good to me? I'm like that. Mike? I want to ask you something. Go ahead. I love these sort of games. You're not in love with me? What's my going to England got to do with that? You're not running away because of me? I am in love with you. Don't hold it against me. You said I was crazy. I was right. No, I made up my mind a long time ago - I'm going because I'm sentimental. I can't help it. It's just one of those things. I've got nothing proper to do here. Oh, you've been awful useful to us. In a way, perhaps. Now you're going, I'm scared. Whatever for? About Stefan. While you're here it's not so bad, but now I don't know. I guess you think I'm awful selfish. Of course not. You've only been married a month. I'm not really selfish. I'm thinking of him as much as myself. I know how he feels. That makes it worse. Oh, don't worry. All aboard. I must run. Must you? I'll miss you both. Do you mind if I kiss you once? I'll not have time to be your best man. Of course. God bless you. God bless you. God bless. Some things belong to me, and nobody else. You ought to know that. I'm beginning to. You're not the sort of... For heaven's sake, stop! Anyone would think I was a criminal. All I did was try to help. As a matter of fact, you did. All I needed was something like this, like Mike going off to make me see things straight. What do you mean? I was beginning to forget what I am. An exile. A man without a country of his own. You say that, after the way you've been treated here? That's why, Carol. I'm happy here. Everybody's kind. It's easy to forget my country and people. Don't be silly. You speak for them through your music. You work for them all the time. It's a nice, easy way of working, I must say. When I left Warsaw, I said one day I'd be back. Thousands of others must have said the same thing. But they are doing something practical. I'd be doing the same if I were flying. Do you believe you'd make any difference by yourself in the war? Can't you understand one important thing? You're a great musician with so much to give. Lots of men fly better than you, but can't do what you can. They can't think in terms of lovely music. There's a power in these hands to play and compose wonderful music. You have a great gift. You can't throw it away because of a stupid patriotic notion. I never thought anybody could feel like that about me. You're not saying this because you want me to stay on? Do you really believe it? I've never believed anything so much. I wonder why I never thought about that. I'm glad you didn't. You'd have been insufferable. Now you understand why you must stay? It does make things look different. Of course. Now will you say you're sorry for being so bad-tempered? You richly deserved it, but I'll be magnanimous. I forgive you. Such a great heart. No wonder I love you. I don't blame you. That's what I like about you - you're so modest. I'll take you all over the city. Let's wait till fall. It's cooler. Have you got any museums I can visit? My uncle has a stamp collection, but he's out of town. You're ashamed of me. You don't want me to meet your family. How did you guess? I'm psychic. Look in my eyes. Look hard. What do you see? Hmmm... They're a bit bloodshot, that's all. That's the love light. What else do you see? Well, I see... Oh, are we there? It's traffic lights. Germans in Paris! Read about it! Paper, paper! Germans in Paris! Read about it. Germans in Paris! Read about it. With Mother in Florida, it looks like my family is trying to avoid you. Don't worry. We'll be there ourselves in a week, won't we? Poor Mother. She's scared of meeting you. She thinks you'll have to talk by signs. Why don't you try it? I'd take you further, but the cab won't go up the steps. Will you go upstairs and get unpacked, please? I've got to see somebody. Business. Don't be long. This settles it. For weeks I've been trying to push it out of my mind, but it's back stronger than ever. Not just because of the news. Suddenly it seems urgent, and must be done at once. Otherwise, I'll be here for life. What you want to tell me is you would like to cancel your second tour? Yes. I never did like contracts. It's all right? You're not angry? I'm not angry. Thank you very much. That's a load off my mind. Don't be silly. I wish I was going with you. I forgot - you're a Frenchman. Tonight, you can't feel too good. I'm no more French than you. I'm English. That surprises you. I know you thought of me as a fake, and you were right. For years I worked as Gus Higgins and got nowhere. Suddenly, one fine day, I became Andre De Guys, the great impresario. Why are you telling me this? I don't know, but when I heard the news I suddenly got a sick feeling, not so much for France, but for England. Feeling all Land Of Hope And Glory! I ought to be in Hyde Park. But this is nothing to do with what we were talking about. You want to go. I won't stand in your way. But what about your wife? I don't know. Go and see her father. He likes you a lot. That's just what I'm going to do. If you feel like that there's nothing else you can do. Carol will understand. That's just it. She doesn't even try to. I don't want to rush off. I'm happy here. I love the applause, my music, I love Carol. I must say, it doesn't sound easy. She's got a good line in tempers. Got it from me. Mine's not good either. You're both liable to say and do things you'll be sorry about. Listen, son, you know I like you, and you know how I feel about Carol. I don't want to see any trouble between you. But if you've made up your mind to go back to flying, that's all there is to it. Thank you, sir. I thought you'd understand. Don't you worry - everything'll turn out all right. Are you coming to dinner before the concert? No. I like to be alone. I'll be in the theatre to hear you. First concert I ever went to. I feel guilty. Make it loud. It's how I like my music. Loud. I'll try my best. Good night. And thanks a lot. Good night. PIANO PLAYS Please don't play that, for heaven's sake. What do you mean? That. It's Chopin's Polonaise. I know. I hate it. It reminds me of the last days in Warsaw. That's why I play it. I've got something to tell you. I've booked a passage on the clipper for tomorrow. Did you say the clipper? Yes. Have you gone crazy? No, but I'm joining our air force in England. Oh, Stefan, let's not have a scene now. Last time we quarrelled you were very upset. Remember? You played awful badly. I'm going to play marvellously tonight, and nothing can stop it. Carol, I'm not quarrelling with you. I'm just telling you I'm going to England, that's all. I don't know what's wrong. I thought you'd given up the idea. I've tried to, Carol. Believe me. I've tried. Every day I tell myself what a marvellous job I'm doing here. And every day I believe it less. That's why I'm going. I have to. Something I can't explain, something I can't help. But I know once I've done it I'll feel all right inside. I think it's madness. Such a stupid waste! Life would be too easy if everybody said that. There would be no art, no music, if it's not worth fighting for. Listen to me. I want to tell you something. Something Mike told me. He asked me not to tell you, but I must. Remember when you left Poland, you drew a plane to Romania? It was fixed. All the men in your squadron asked that you should be sent away. You meant something to Poland. It didn't matter about them as long as you were alive. You want to throw away the very thing they tried to do for you. Are you still going now? Nothing can stop me now. Nothing. You mean you're going, even without me? I have to. You must love me an awful lot! I do. I love you more than anything in life, more than life itself, but not even my love for you can stop me. Go on. Maybe it's better that way. What do you mean? I'm not going to be just a part of your life like your music and patriotism. I'd rather be nothing. If you go, you go for good. I can get a divorce any time. So what happens depends entirely on you! Thank you. For heaven's sake, don't be so jumpy. You'll make me nervous too. It's just I had a row with Stefan tonight. Yeah? I suppose it's about him going back to England? How did you know? Oh, I just guessed. It happened before, but... tonight was different. There, there. Everything'll work out all right. Don't you worry. I hope so. AUDIENCE APPLAUD AUDIENCE APPLAUD AUDIENCE CHEER Merveilleux! You were superb. Superb. Go and take another bow. They want you to make a speech. Listen! What an ovation. Don't tell them you are going... Please, please. Go and say something, anything. Quick, quick! Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't make a speech to you now, even if I tried, but I can thank you, not only for the way you've received me tonight, but for all the people of your country have been doing for the people of mine. I speak for them when I say we are very grateful. Thank you. I'll play one more piece. The last music to come out of free Warsaw. The music that taught the world that Poland was still alive. Tonight it still is. HE PLAYS "Polonaise No.1" by Frederic Chopin PERFORMANCE BROADCAST ON RADIO Turn off the radio. For heaven's sake, turn it off! OK, lady. I like that sort of music myself. CAROL CRIES Say, what's going on here? First you run out on me, and then I find you crying. Say, what is all this anyway? I wish I was dead! Don't start talking like Hamlet. It's too late at night. That's right, have a good cry. It'll make you feel a lot better. Here, take this. Now, go on. Have a good blow. Thank you. I'm always borrowing your handkerchiefs. Yes, and I never get 'em back either. Tell me, young lady - what's the matter with you? I've been such a beast tonight, Daddy. You mean about Stefan? Yes. I told you we had a row. Uh-huh. Well, I said awful things to him. Things that hurt him a lot. People often do that to someone they really love. What did you say? I said if he went to England now I'd leave him for good. But I didn't mean it. I couldn't. I love him much too much. Oh, Daddy, you don't think he thought I really meant it? I shouldn't think so. You go tell him you're sorry, and it'll be all right. Oh... I couldn't. Not tonight. I wouldn't know what to say. Besides, I look such a mess. Tomorrow. Then you better stay here. Oh, Daddy, I don't know what I'd do without you. Well, that's what I'm here for. Good night. Night. Daddy? Why do you think he played the Polonaise? The what? The loud piece at the end. I don't know. They all sound the same to me. He was sticking his tongue out, to show he wouldn't change his mind. I still wouldn't know. Good night. Good night, Daddy. Stefan? Stefan? Stefan? Stefan! What do you think? Much better than I thought it would be. Different from the crates we used. How much do you get out of yours? You get 370, but after our ground boys have finished with them, you can add another 50. We have eight guns too, and a movie camera. What's the camera for? To keep a check on Irishmen. When we shoot a plane down he has his photo taken. Come on, you fool, I'm hungry. Hello, Popeye. Time for lemonade before lunch. Thirsty weather, this. Lemonade, did you say? I'm on the wagon. I wanted to ask you - don't say anything about me being a musician. Don't put your foot in it. Get a haircut. Like that, you'll pass for an ordinary human being. Did you have a good leave? Fine, thanks. Can't you see the rings under my eyes? Blimey, I thought it was camouflage. I hear we got 86 yesterday. Going down. Let's look at our own score. 12 to 8. We still have the lead. Let's have lunch. HE HUMS Still murdering that tune? Have you got an easy number to remember? Where do you sit? Over here. Hello, Pete. Are you on today? Yes, I think we'll be called out. How's your Polish getting on? Steve's teaching me a lot. Je suis un bon eleve, n'est-ce pas? Mais oui. SPEAKS POLISH Wonderful. Oh, right. Well, see you later. OK. Don't you wish them luck? We're in England. Oh, to be in England... I bet a lot of Jerry airmen are thinking the same thing. I wonder how many we'll knock down today. Cabbage. MIKE HUMS I think you're bluffing. I'll raise you to eight gallons. HUMS Don't you know any other music? That's the finest music - the Rose Of Tralee. These are too darn hot for this time of year. I'll see you. HE HUMS Blast! That's my petrol gone till October. Anybody want to buy a car? Going cheap. I knew you were bluffing. Your nose was twitching. 16, 18, 22, 24. I think I'll open a garage. This is my lucky day. Unlucky at cards, lucky in love, eh, Steve? The crew'll be out for the moment. Stiff tackle. He forgot his cigarettes. What a crook that man is. I must get my own back one of these days. Mustn't grumble - I palmed off four dud coupons on him. Out of date. You don't mind a third, do you? Seems lucky, this war. I don't want to hear any more about it. Leave it. I've forgotten her. Hear what she has to say... I don't want to. It's over as far as I'm concerned. Don't be so pig-headed. Why can't you be a human being for a change? You've been like this for weeks. Mike, I know you're trying to help, but all you're doing is to make things worse. I haven't heard from Carol since I've been in England. I've been almost able to get her out of my system. Now you go and put me back where I was when we split up. All I want to do is forget I ever met her. I don't want to fight, but you are making a mess of your lives over a stupid trifle. You are both to blame. She may have started it, but you're trying to finish it. Let me, instead of interfering. I don't even want to hear her name. I'm trying to tell you she's written... Do you think you could leave me alone? If we're going to stay friends, keep off the subject. Come on, boys, get a move on. HE HUMS "Rose Of Tralee" MUSIC ON PIANO: "Rose Of Tralee" He was wild, but I can't think what he was trying to do. Yes. Poor old Mike. He said it was his lucky day when we were playing poker. Yes, I remember. What is that that he's playing? The tune Mike was always singing. I thought I'd seen you before. I've often seen you on records. I suppose you were letting off steam last night. Yes. Different ways of doing it. We British don't say much, but we feel things the same as others. This is his room, I think. I suppose you don't mind doing this? He was my best friend. We all liked him. You have to take these things as a matter of course, or we wouldn't last five minutes. A pilot has to be fit in every way nowadays. If he's upset in any way, has something on his mind, it's absolutely fatal. I had to get rid of one of the best pilots I've ever seen. He was always getting on the nerves of the rest of the squadron. He had these with him. If you mind doing it, for heaven's sake say so. Somebody'll have to look through his papers. It's all right. I'll get his batman to see about his cases. MUSIC: "Rose Of Tralee" SIREN BLARES Hurry up! Coming. Squadron leader speaking. 30 bandits below. Let her go! RESUMES PLAYING STOPS ABRUPTLY (Carol.) (Carol.)
