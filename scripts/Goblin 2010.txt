Your child is unclean. No. It is misshapen, diseased. An abomination. He has done nothing wrong. You know the ritual. All that is unclean, we give up to the flame. Samhain is for the common good. It is to ensure our health and well-being. No, please. Please! Let us all be cleansed! No! Oh, baby. Why? No child of this village, shall be safe here on after, when the sun rises on Samhain. She's a witch. Witch! And now you will pay. No one will get you now. Nikki. Nikki. Can you take that off, please? Thank you. He dropped his chew-chew. Can you pass it to him, please? What? His pacifier, he can't reach it, neither can I. Hello? Earth to Nikki. Kate's been trying to get your attention for five minutes. Five minutes? Dad, I doubt it was five minutes. Oh, now you're arguing. Arguing is not helpful. I'm not arguing. Now, look at you. You're arguing about arguing. Nikki, we're supposed to be having a great time. Well, sorry to disappoint you. What? What did I miss? Nothing. Just another gripping parental lecture. Now, take a look at that. That's got opportunity written all over it. Dad, come on. You can't even find this place on the GPS. That's why they call it opportunity, Nikki. Vision means seeing something before it's there. It means dreaming of a better future. I thought you told me to live in the here and the now. Isn't that what you're always saying? Well, I can't win with you. Actually, Nikki, I'd like you to do both. Hey, isn't there a ski resort around here or something? That's Brooksbank. It's on the other side of the mountain. The side that made it into this millennium. You just watch, after I'm finished, the boutiques and bistros of Hollowglen, are gonna make Brooksbank seem totally passe, and then the luxury condos will come up and we are gonna be rich. Yeah, well, you might wanna run that past Nathan when he gets older, and see how he feels about spending, the rest of eternity in Hollowglen. We're going to use the bathroom. Okay. Hi. Hi, sweetie, are you happy? Are you happy? How's he doing? He's ready for a nap. How you doing? I'm ready for a nap. You don't have to come to the meeting, I mean. Well, that's not till tomorrow, right? I'll be fine. Besides, I like to see you in action. Did I tell you that I love you today? No. Then I'm a bad husband. The worst. Sit anywhere, as you like. I will be with you in a second. Hi, I don't think we are staying actually. My dad just needed some directions. What can I do you for? "What can I do you for?" Well, hi. We rented a cabin at the end of Willow Road. And we can't seem to find it. Willow Road, you say? "Willow Road, you say?" Yeah, that's right. Girls, I thought you said you had to go to the bathroom. Surely do, Dad. Go on. Straight back here. I'm sorry about that. Neil Perkins. Sheriff Dan Milgreen. How do you do? I'm fine. Thank you. You wanna head to the general store and hit your right. Go up the mountain road about 3 miles, take the first left you see. That's Willow Road. Thank you. You renting the Holmes' house? Yeah. How did you know? Well, there ain't but one cabin on Willow Road, right at the end. Well, look at that. Isn't he beautiful? What's his name? Nathan. Nathan. May I? Yeah. Let me guess. It's six months? Yeah, exactly. Fine-looking boy. Thank you. Those your girls, too? Only one of them. The other is her best friend. That's quite an age difference between your daughter and your son. Second family, second chances, you know. Second chances. I'd say, they're pretty darn important. Such a good boy. Good for you. No! Oh, no, no. No, no, you're not supposed to be here. What're you doing here? You're not supposed to be here. I'm sorry. Didn't you warn them? I'm sorry, folks, pay no attention. Come on, Charlie, time to hit the trail. There's a curse on this town. Now, Charlie, stop embarrassing yourself. There's evil here. I'm not gonna tell you again. Now that's it. Don't they know tomorrow is Halloween? Enough with this nonsense. Don't pay him no mind, he probably just needs a drink. Well, please, thank the sheriff for all of his help. That'll be easy, seeing how he's my husband. Oh! Okay, well, thank you. Be seeing you. I don't know what's worse, the quaint or the creepy. This is just a small town, Nikki. Show a little compassion, sweetheart. The guy is obviously homeless. Or he's an alcoholic or a drug addict or he's bipolar. There's a reason people act that way. How about demonic possession? "There's evil here. " "Don't they know it's Halloween?" Sorry, Mr. Perkins. Go on. Get out of here! "Go on. Get out of here. " This can only get better. Not too bad. Thrill. It's pretty cold in here. There's no service. Thermostat looks broken. This light's out. So, we build a fire and change the lights. Vision, okay? Cheers, Dad. What do we do about reception? We appreciate the peace. I'm so glad I convinced you to come. Whatever. It's better than sitting at home watching my dad play video games with my stupid brother. When real life sucks this bad, bring on the virtual. Hey, how bad has it been? Really, scale of one to 10. You really wanna know? Since Mom died, it's been about a solid nine. You know what's always there though, always? I'm never good enough for my dad. Well, then you wouldn't wanna live with us. Why? Because it wouldn't be any different. Hey, who is that? Oh, no. What? The golf pro. Your dad has a golf pro? No, that's what my mom used to call him. That's Owen. She hated him. What's he doing here? So? So, are you ready to do this? You need to confirm. Lunch at Bea's, Nice work. Yeah. It's amazing the way this whole thing just suddenly turned around, huh? Tell me about it. I mean, for years they rejected every proposal. Yeah, it's the recession. I'm telling you. It softened them up a bit. Everybody's hurting right now. Well, it could be. Might be something else. Like what? Who knows? So many variables. Tomorrow, we gotta ask the tough questions. Which we will. All right, and if the offer is right? Then we close this deal and become giants among men! You still taking that testosterone supplement, right? Day and night, yeah. You wanna come in? No, no, I'm good. I'm good. I got stuff to do. Give my best to Kate. Okay. All right? All right. Will catch you tomorrow. Right. It's good, man. Be positive. Yeah. So Owen's part of this now? Well, yes, as a matter of fact. But I thought you promised Mom that you're never gonna work with him again. That was a long time ago. Things change. Yep, they sure have. Mom's gone, you're remarried and I seem to be the only one who cares about anything she said. Hey, hey, hey. Nikki. Honey, slow down. What's wrong? Did seeing Owen make you think about your mother? I don't need him to help me think about her. I think about her every single day. I'm gonna go check on her. What just happened? She's 17. She misses her mom. Wanna go for a walk? Yeah, it'll help. I don't understand why he'd go back and work with Owen when my mom specifically asked him not to. I don't know why you care so much. You know, Nik, I remember you telling me that your mom specifically asked you to do something, too. What? You told me that she asked you to take care of your dad. Whoa! Whose side are you on? I'm on yours. Come on, you know that. I'm just also on the side of your family. Take it from me. You got a pretty good one. Ugh! Stop being so mature. Okay, last you'll see of it, I promise. Let's go have some fun. Do you think we should turn back? I really don't want to bump into that old drunk guy. Not without a cross and some holy water, anyway. Let's go. Come on. All that is unclean, we give up to the flame. Samhain is for the common good. Your child is unclean. She's a witch. He has done nothing wrong. No child shall be safe when the sun rises on Samhain. Are you all right? What happened? Tell me we didn't hit a skunk. There's no dent. There's no blood. Sounds like a caffeine hallucination, which means it's time for me to drive. Yeah, no argument there. Hang on a sec. Derek? Derek? Derek! Happy Halloween. You're messy. You're messy. You're a messy boy. Where's Dad? He's with Owen. So, what are your plans? I don't know, there's just so many options. It's kind of overwhelming. Well, if you're really stuck for ideas, you can go into town and get some more diapers and wipes. Can we take the car? No, but you could take the bikes. Just be back by noon? Brooksbank is, like, I meant Hollowglen. Come on, that place is a freak show. Your father is right, you really do have an overactive imagination. What did you say? It's not what I said, Nikki. Come on, Nik, we can make it fun. See, at least Cammy doesn't think it's such a terrible idea. Well, she's obviously not afflicted with an overactive imagination. I am so. I need the car for Nathan. It's as simple as that, in case there's an emergency. It's always about Nathan, isn't it? Nathan, Dad, you, but never me. Come on, Cam, time to take the Hollowglen thrill ride. You know that's not what I meant. Can't wait. I just meant... I don't know what I meant. Told you you'd regret this trip. I'm gonna prove you so wrong. Hi, boys. So, what do you think? No marks, no blood, no bodies. Probably a prank. Couple of Brooksbank kids out for a joyride. Yeah, most likely. There's one thing though, Sheriff. Empty baby seat in the back there. Yeah, so? Well, you know what day it is. Don't go soft on me, Perry. No. I'm just saying. This is your first Halloween here? Yes, sir, it is, and I just heard some stories about... About missing kids and a monster in the night? Yeah. It was along those lines, yeah. Yeah, well, they are stories, plain and simple. Look, the last thing I need is a copycat criminal or a superstitious deputy. I'll check with the DMV, see who owns the vehicle. You keep an eye out for yahoos or anyone else looks up to no good. Yes, sir. Yes. "Closed for Halloween. " What is it with this place? I think someone's in there. Hello? Anybody home? We're closed! I know. I'm sorry. We just need to pick up a few things. We'll be open tomorrow. Ma'am, please. We rode a long way on our bikes. Is there any way that you can help us out? We're customers. Are you thirsty? You need a drink? Well, yeah. I could use a drink, but we came for some baby stuff, just some diapers. You have a baby with you? At the cabin, yeah. No! No, no, no, no. No! No, no. It's okay. He's not sick or anything. Leave Hollowglen. Before it's too late. Seriously? Do you think we should start taking the hint? No doubt. Nikki Perkins? Kyle? Nikki, what's up? It's been a while, huh? Kyle? The Kyle? Shh! Have you been talking about me? What are you doing here? Just looking for trouble. Hey, I'm Matt. Hi, I'm trouble. Pay no attention to her. She's on meds. I'm not. But I probably should be. What are you guys doing here? We just came to get some stuff for my baby brother, but the place is closed, so... Yeah, yeah, this place shuts down on Halloween. It's really weird. It's awesome. Awesome. So, where you going to college? I'm actually taking a year off. I'm just house-sitting my uncle's place in Brooksbank. House-sitting? Yeah, Matt's up for the weekend and we just got the place to ourselves. Cool. Hey, if you want, we can go to Brooksbank and get those things you needed. Sounds good, but I have to be back right away, so... Where you staying? We're staying in Hollowglen, just a cabin off Willow Road, I think. Willow Road? No way. Yeah. Why, what's the deal? I don't know, there's just some freaky legend that got started up that way, so... My sister knows the whole crazy story. It's about a bonfire ring at the top of Willow Road. Creepy. No doubt. This place is so loony. Well, we are meeting up with her later and she's probably gonna hear all about it. If you guys wanna join? Mmm-hmm. Place is empty, may as well come on in. Not too many folks for you to upset, except me. I'll be on my best behavior, Bea. I promise. A lot of good that'll do me. I can see myself getting upset already. I always like your coffee, Bea. You like it so much you douse it with whiskey every time I turn my back. Well, you can hardly keep a secret in this town. Is it okay? You do what you gotta do. We all cope the best we can. How do you cope, Bea? What do you mean? You know what I mean, Bea. Knowing about the curse. Maybe you just best take that flask and that brew right on out of here. I swear I don't know why I bother. You come in here every Halloween haunting us like a ghost. Now, Bea, you know, you more than anybody else, you should know that we gotta find a way to end it. How? You know there ain't no way. Yes, there is, Bea. There is a way. See, a while back, I found something that I had been searching a long time for. And I know what to do now to end it. Lord Almighty, you really are crazy. You get on out of here now, you hear? I ain't crazy, Bea. You gotta believe me, please. Not another word! I'm done listening to you! I'm done talking to you! Ain't we got a responsibility, Bea? That we do. And I'll be attending to my own. Nikki. What are you doing? It's 12:20, Kate asked you to be here at noon. Well, it took longer than we thought, Dad. I'm sorry. We tried to reach you on your cell. Really? It never rang. Price you pay for paradise. This is no joke, Nikki. Now we have to go and you're supposed to be watching Nathan. What? Why? Because we have a business lunch and somebody needs to be with him. Why can't Kate do it? She's coming with me. Can't you guys just take him with you? No, Nikki, we can't. It's a business lunch. Can we have a second? Who are they? Friends who gave us a ride. Well, they can't stay here unsupervised. Unsupervised? Daddy, I'm 17. I can hang out with boys, can't I? Not here and not while you're alone. Oh, my God, are you serious? Look, you want adult privileges, you need to show me some responsibility. You knew there was going to be some babysitting while you were here. You know, if you never had Nathan, I would have a completely different life. Mr. Perkins, I'm Kyle Waters. I believe you know my father. This is my friend Matt. Hello. You are Franklin Waters' son? Yeah. Well, thanks for giving the girls a ride, but we have to go, so... Why don't you come by tomorrow for a little lunch. How about that? Sure. Sure, yeah. Thanks, Mr. Perkins. Why don't I just bring him with us? I mean, she's not in a good frame of mind to watch him right now, anyway. No, no, no. I need you on site. Plus, you're my good luck charm. It'll be good for Nikki. Okay, I'll get my purse. Okay. Fun, huh? Ooh! I know. We can watch Nathan sleep all day. Good idea, Nikki. At least there's no static. Yeah. What's that about? Did your parents forget something? They have a key. Is someone messing with us? If they are, they're gonna get this poker up their butt. That's it. Stop! Stop! That hurt. You totally deserved that. I'm really happy to see you. Yeah, me, too. Oh! This is my older sister, Jane. That's Cammy and Nikki. Happy Halloween. Yeah. Happy Halloween. We brought you some diapers. You went all the way to Brooksbank to get diapers? Well, we had to pick up Jane and we wanted to save your dad a trip to, you know, prove we're not psychos. That's pretty nice. Yeah, well, maybe it makes up for us being here when we kind of shouldn't be. Yeah, maybe. And since we are already doing something we shouldn't be. You wanna go check out that Halloween bonfire? I can't, I'm sorry. Hold on one second, guys. We'll be right back. Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding? Everywhere. Cam, you know I can't go. Come on, Nik, please. Matt and I have a connection. You hit him with a fire poker. I know. Okay, so are we gonna make the best out of this weekend or what? You heard my dad. I have to watch Nathan. Plus, Matt's sister is here, isn't that kind of weird? Not at all. Look, she said it's not very far away. So, why don't we take the baby monitor and if it starts to get fuzzy, we'll just come back. That's a terrible idea. Well, if you can't go, can I go at least? Well, that sucks. Just don't make them leave. They can tell us their story here. Outside? Fine, whatever. Fine. Come on. Cafe is closed. What? Not only that, hardware store, gas station is closed. The entire town is closed. It's nuts. This is a Halloween. It's like one of the biggest holidays of the year. And it's lights-out. You wanna know why? Brace yourself. It's cursed. The curse of Hollowglen began a long, long time ago with the sacrifice of an innocent. Not my baby, please. There's a curse on the whole town. I'm not kidding you. When I did my due diligence, okay. I talked to some of the locals here. And there was a curse put on this whole place. A poor little baby that the villagers believed was an evil spirit. All that is unclean, we give up to the flame. He has done nothing wrong. So was your due diligence talking with some crazy-looking guy named Charlie? You talked to him, too? In a twisted ritual, they tossed the baby into a bonfire they made every Halloween to purge the town of evil things. No! Yeah, well, I won't be swayed by the ramblings of a drunk. The remains of the bonfire still exist today. Right through there. No way. Yes, way. No, I'm not swayed. I'm a businessman. There's nothing that's gonna get in the way of me and a good deal. But it made me think, though... Wait a minute, they wanted to purge the town of evil by tossing a baby into a bonfire? I mean, isn't that a little... Totally messed up? Yeah, but what do you want? It was a couple of hundred years ago and they were clueless. Okay, maybe it's one of the reasons why nobody's ever developed around here. Right? Everybody is all freaked out. They also didn't know that the baby's mom was a witch. He's got a point. Local superstition can sway away business. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. "Uh-oh," is right, and she was pissed. Before anybody could stop her, she called upon the powers of darkness to raise a foul-smelling demon out from the baby's bones. Some farmer has a two-headed calf and everybody has to eat pickles for a week. To this day, no baby in Hollowglen is safe when the sun rises on Halloween. Not till the spell is broken the following sunup. I mean, they're whacko, right? Well, let's hope that's a good thing. I mean, for us. The hours in between, so they say, is when the Goblin is on the prowl. Oh, my God. Nathan! Nikki. Thank God. That's a relief. Sorry, I kind of freaked out a little, didn't I? That's okay. We all did. I was so scared after hearing that story, you know. I... Yeah, well, you know what? I'm here now, so it's all right. My hero. That's more like it. Yeah. He may need a diaper change. Hold on. There's something I've been wanting to do. So I take it Nathan's okay. Yep. He's good. Fine. All good. We'll be downstairs. Okay. Hey, Sheriff. Sorry I'm late, folks. Mr. Perkins, I didn't know you were part of this gathering. Sheriff, you remember my wife, Kate. Hello, again. Hi. I didn't know you were a member of the chamber of commerce. Well, in a little town, a man's gotta wear a lot of hats. Come on in. Is that nice and soft? Can you, please, not... I take good care of you. You're embarrassing me. I'm embarrassing you. Good, I'm trying to embarrass you. They were kissing. Are you serious? Mmm-hmm. That's more like it. Nothing like a good Halloween story to put you in the mood. Yeah, I know what you mean. How about a fire? Yeah, but we'll need some firewood then. Okay, well, I'm gonna go outside and get some. Cammy, did you wanna help? Mmm-hmm. I'm good at finding wood. Gross. She's okay. Just be cool, all right? Guy says something funny, laugh, be courteous, all that kind of stuff. Small-town folk, they like that kind of thing. Okay, I'll let you do the laughing. Certain advantages to being married to the owner of the town eatery. Makes a handy conference room. So, Sheriff, can you tell us anything about the town curse? You're referring to Charlie, aren't you? He's quite a spectacle. Not exactly. Why is the town closed on Halloween? What's that about? That's just an old tradition dating back to the days when the town elders celebrated Samhain, festival of the dead. It just stuck over the years, is all. There you go. Nice and hot. So, there's no curse? Only if you think being stuck in the wrong century is a curse. And I'm doing what I can to lift that one. So have you finished high school? Yeah, last year. What about you? No. I can't wait to graduate. So do you live in Brooksbank? Half the year. Dad works for the forest service, so... So is he like a park ranger? Kind of. He works in administration. So you must be an expert in the outdoors? Hardly. You must be an expert in all sorts of things? Yeah, absolutely. Like, what did you have in mind? You know, the basics. Like starting a fire. I already know you're really good at that. You are so hot. Careful, you might get burned. Not likely. What? Did you see something? I don't know. Jane, is that you? Oh! Wow, do you smell that? Yeah, what is it? Okay, something's out there. What is it? That's Kyle. It's gotta be Kyle. That's awesome, dude. You... You're the man. He's totally screwing with us. Well, dude, that totally just... Run! Run! That sounds like Cammy. It sounds like Matt. Don't fall for it. You think it's a joke? If you knew my brother, then you'd know it was a joke. That's what Halloween's all about. It's like April Fools. We're getting punked. It's gonna be happening all day. Okay, I'll take up the challenge and I bet I win. Win what? Best scare. Amateurs. What if something really is the matter? Then Jane's gonna find out pretty quickly. Aren't you at all concerned? I'm more worried about you than I am about Cammy and Matt. Why? Because, Nikki, I know what happened to your mom. I know what you had to go through. I haven't seen you since it happened. Hey, hey, come here. Come here. Maybe I should be scared of you. Everything's gonna be okay. You better not be saying all this just to get some action, 'cause that'd be pretty lame. I better go check on Nathan. You know, you're a really good sister. And I'm not just saying that to get some action. So, Sheriff. What did you think of the proposal? I liked it, well thought out, well presented. Good plan. And what did everyone else think? Gentlemen, like I said before, this town don't like change. Hell, Bea and I are still trying to fit in. We've been living here for over a dozen years now. So, there were issues. Well, that's a nice way of putting it. Wait a second. Wait a second. You said that if this town didn't open itself up to development, that the town would die. That's right. I said that. Yeah, you said that. You also said that it was all very promising. Yes, I did. You urged me to invite up Neil and his family to come up here and meet with you... Son, developing Hollowglen is not gonna happen overnight. Now, if I put that into your head, I'm sorry. It'll be a process. Is the offer too low? It's not about the money. Yeah, it's always about the money. How much are we talking about? How much more? How much? It's okay. Son, if you really think that, you don't know a lot about people. Boo! Hide. Hide. You're pretty good. I mean it, get down. You're setting a high bar. Where's Matt? It got him. It was horrible. What did? The Goblin. Dude, stop it. You're freaking me out. Cammy, please! What I told you up there, half of it I made up! It's just a story. There's no Goblin. Matt! Jane! Jane, where are you? No matter what happens with this deal, let me tell you, I think you're fine folks, and you'll be welcome at Hollowglen anytime. So, thanks for coming and let's keep talking. Look, I don't care what that guy said in there. It's all about the money. Were you and I at different meetings? What? What do you mean? It means she... You need to start listening to people. No, Neil, come on. It's a game, man. Oldest one in the book. He was testing us and we failed. All right, we come up with just a little extra scratch and we can lock this baby down. It's easy for you to say. It's not your money. Never was. Yeah. What do you think, Kate? I think he's not saying something, which makes me nervous. Because he's playing us. Neil, behind the "Aw, shucks" act, this guy is an operator. I'm telling you, we double the offer and we lock it down. We nail this thing today. I'll think about it. Good. And I'll take that as a yes, all right? So, I'm gonna crack open that bottle of champagne I was saving to celebrate our new real estate empire! Right? It was good. I'll catch you guys later. You were right. The sheriff's hiding something. But you know something? I just realized something today. What? I can't stand Owen. Yeah. Took you long enough. Well, say goodbye to Hollowglen, 'cause we are out of here. Is he okay? Yeah, still sleeping. He's a good sleeper. For now. Then we're lucky. You think you're gonna get lucky or something? It's just nice to be with you. You smell nice. Stop being so charming. I just keep thinking this is like a Halloween prank or something. Have you heard from the others yet? Not yet. I think they're giving us some time alone. What time is it? Just a little past 2:00. Past 2:00? No, no, no. You gotta go. I just don't have the energy for another fight with my dad. Just go find Cam, okay? Are you sure? Yeah, absolutely. They should have been back by now. And if you weren't so busy sniffing my hair, you'd know I'm right about that. Oh, my God! That sounded like Cammy. Oh, my God. Cammy! Cammy! Nikki! Don't panic, okay? It could still be a joke. That was no joke, okay. You're right. You're right. We have to do something. I don't know what to do. I can't leave Nathan. You go back and stay with Nathan. I'll be back soon. Nathan. Nathan! Nathan! So, let me get this straight. You heard screams. You ran outside and followed them into the woods. Then, Nikki, you ran back here and found Nathan missing? And you ran back here when you heard her scream? Right. So you couldn't have been out of the house for more than a minute or so. That about right? Maybe less. Someone must have been watching the house or something. What if it was one of Kyle's friends? Or Cammy? What if this was just a poorly considered Halloween gag taken way too far? They feel terrible about it, but don't know how to end it. I mean, that's it, isn't it? They're just scared. They wanna bring him back, but don't know how. Nikki, tell them we won't be mad. If they just bring him back, we'll forget any of this ever happened. Cammy didn't take Nathan. How do you know? Kyle, if you know anything about this, you need to tell us right now. Don't hold back, son! Calm down! I'll handle this. If there's anything he's hiding, we'll find out at the station. They may have the baby at the girl's parents' house or somewhere in Brooksbank. If those don't pan out, I'll contact the county. Organize a search. But I didn't do anything. Don't dig yourself a hole, young man. What if it was the Goblin? I'm sorry? The baby stealer. What are you talking about? This really is a prank, isn't it? No, I mean, it all fits with the story. I know this is a small town and all, but I will not be party to discussing fairy tales in the context of a missing persons investigation. Copycat. Deputy, take the boy to the station. I'll meet you there. Let's go. Now. You can't take me. I had nothing to do with this. I don't understand why you guys aren't searching in the woods. Cammy sounded hurt and she may be dying. You guys didn't hear the screams, okay. They were real. Simplest explanation is usually the truth. I'll get back to you if it's more complicated. Be in touch. Thank you, Sheriff. The Goblin? Dad, Jane told us this story about a Halloween creature that steals babies. I know it sounds crazy, but this sounds... Nikki, don't torture us, please. I'm not, okay? I'm just as upset about this as you guys are. How could you be? You're not his mother. Dad. I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. I know you are, honey. But I need your help to make this right. How? Who do you think left us this? I don't know. Someone's trying to tell us something. No. No. The babies all went missing on Halloween. The curse is true. No, this just mentions missing babies. Doesn't mean there's a goblin or a curse. Oh, my God. The sheriff had a son that went missing on Halloween, too. Why didn't he say anything? Where are you going? I'm gonna go in the woods and check for Cammy. You two, look out for each other. Nikki, I'm so sorry. I should have listened to you. Be safe. Be sure to lock in. Dad! Cammy! Matt! Cammy! I haven't done anything wrong. I'm cooperating, okay. I just wanna get my... What the... Get back in the car. Now! Get back in the car. Now! Get back in the car! Sheriff, I'm on foot pursuit of an unknown person, possibly hostile, out on Route 140, over. Sheriff... Don't be stupid. I know who you are! Perry, talk to me. What's your 20? Over. Sheriff, I'm not sure, but I may have found our copycat. Cammy? Cammy! Cammy! Hello? Cammy! Kate, do you smell that? Cammy? Oh, my God. Nikki, I see somebody just outside. Stay upstairs, okay? No, I wanna be with you. No, stay upstairs. Kate! Kate. Kyle! Get in! What is that? Get us out of here! I'm trying. Where'd he go? Where'd he go, Kyle? Come on. Come on. Come on. No, Owen. No! Nikki, what's going on? Move your car. Give me your keys. No, I'm not giving you my keys. What do you want my keys for? What's going on? Run. Run, Owen. Run! Run! Yeah. Okay, I get it. This is Halloween, right? Like I'm gonna fall for that one. Kyle, we have to do something. Yeah. Run, Owen. Run! Go. Move! Run! Go! Run! No! Hey, over here. Get in the car. Quick! Come on. Kate? Kate. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, sweetheart? Nikki! Nikki! What's your emergency? Yeah, my wife, she's been attacked. Is she breathing? Barely. We need an ambulance. We need to get to a hospital. I'll connect you to the sheriff. No, I don't need the sheriff! I need a paramedic, damn it! Come on. I got something I wanna show you. It's okay. Don't worry, we're safe here. Come, sit down. Have a seat. Sit down, son. You'll pardon if I drink. So what was that thing? You heard the stories? About the Goblin? What do you think? I think whatever that thing is, it has my little brother. If it had your brother, it wouldn't still be chasing you. It smells your brother on you, and it's still on the hunt. So who has him, then? I don't know. But I got a good idea where to start. Bea's place. I'll help you find him, if you'll help me do something. Anything. Help me kill the Goblin? Okay. How do we kill it? Magic. So, what, you have like a wand or a broomstick or something? Is it a diary? Yeah. It's a witch's diary. Where did you get this? She was my great-great-great-grandmother. The witch of Hollowglen? Yeah. She's family. Don't worry, I ain't gonna turn you into toads or anything. I ain't got no power, myself. It was a horrible thing that they had done to her and her baby. And she struck back out of anger and vengeance. But years later, she realized what a horrible thing she'd done and she'd come back to Hollowglen to put an end to it. But she died before she could finish it. But she left that and this. She carved this herself. It's a charred branch from the original fire and this here, is some of her hair. All of her power is in this. And we have to plunge it into the heart of the Goblin. How do you know that'll work? Well, I don't know for sure, but bullets don't kill it. It slows it down a little bit, maybe. But it's a spirit. This is our only hope. You ever tried this before? A while back, but I had lost my nerve and been trying to get it back ever since. That's why I drink. But I can't do it alone. Nobody can. And that's why I need your help. Okay. Okay. Let's go. It's here. That's its stench. What do we do? It smells the baby on you. We could do it now. We could kill it now. You stand right here. Charlie! No, she's not bait, okay? Run. Go on, get out of here! Go, go, go. Charlie, what about the spear? Get out of here. Quick! I can keep driving to Brooksbank, okay. There's no way that thing can follow us. Brooksbank? We got a full tank of gas. We can go anywhere. We just left him there. I don't know where my dad is. Kate's dead. I don't know what to do. I know. Okay? Name a place and I'll take you there. I have to find Nathan. I have to find my dad. We don't know where they are, okay. If we don't leave, that thing is gonna get us. I have to find my brother, okay. Okay. I'm gonna get you through this. You promise? I promise. Okay. Okay. Charlie said something about Bea's place. I don't know what that meant, but he seems to know what he's talking about. Maybe we should just go there. Okay. Hold on, sweetie. Hold on. Sheriff. Bea used to be a nurse. She'll know what to do. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. We gotta go. Charlie was wrong, okay. There's no one here. It's okay. It's okay. You know, it's like everyone knows there's something. What do you mean? This place closes down for Halloween. It's just so... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's it. The two creepy women at the convenience store only warned me after they found out about Nathan. Everyone knows. They're just trying to protect people. Think about Charlie. Look at Bea and the sheriff. This happened to them and their child. They just don't want it to happen to anyone else. If they know that, they might know more. The might know where Nathan is. No alarm. Yeah. But there's a phone. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, it's Neil. I'm not here. Leave a message. Is anyone here? Dad. Dad, the Goblin story's real. I know it sounds crazy, but something happened. It broke in through the window, and Kate's... I think Kate's dead. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey. Don't shoot. What are you doing, breaking into my place? My friend... We're in trouble. Bea! Bea, you gotta help us. Someone took my little brother. I know. He's here. He's okay? You mean, he's okay? He's sleeping. Precious angel. What the hell were you thinking? Watch that mouth, young'un. There's a lot you don't know about Hollowglen, so don't go thinking you got everything figured right. Oh, my God. Thank God he's okay. What's going on? Hey! Hey! Hey! Let us out! What are you doing? Bea, please. What are you doing? Can you hear me, sweetheart? Hold on, sweetie. Hold on. It sounds like it pierced the lung. She's barely drawing breath. We should get her to a hospital. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Kate? Kate? No? No? No! Whoa, son, don't go proving your stupidity. I want answers. What are you talking about? I want the truth. Talk. Calm down. What do you wanna know? Why did you bring us here? You want the truth? I wanna know everything. Drop the gun. Drop the gun. This is a big misunderstanding. You gotta believe me. You best listen to him, Mr. Perkins. It's a big mistake, Deputy. I'm telling you. These are bad people, Deputy. Bad people. Good work, Deputy. Thank you, Sheriff. Lost the copycat in the woods. What's going on here? Looks like our copycat killer made his way straight to us. What? You heard me. Copycat serial killer. We've been looking for you a long time. So I killed my wife, huh? I kidnapped my son? Are you hearing this, Deputy? It's all right, Deputy. You can holster your weapon. Looks like we have the situation well under control. Never really do know about people, do you, sir? That's right. You never do. What's that? That a baby crying, Sheriff? It's my son, Nathan. Isn't it, Sheriff? You better keep your mouth shut, son. You're in enough trouble as it is. Sheriff, is that true? Sheriff? Dan, don't! That a gunshot? Sure sounded like it. You wanna know the truth? You wanna know the truth, Mr. Perkins? We need your baby. Dad! Nikki. Don't get any bright ideas, boy. You know you'd do the same if it was you. You have another child. A beautiful daughter. Me and Daniel, you see, we don't. It's okay, Bea. Dad, it took Kate. It killed Kate. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It killed everyone. We saw it kill Owen right in front of us. So you... What did you see? It was the Goblin, Dad. It's real. It's true, Mr. Perkins. We saw it. You have to believe us. It broke into the house, Dad, and now it's after Nathan. Why would it be after Nathan? It's part of the story. It's a curse. It's the curse of Hollowglen. It steals the babies. I don't know what it does with them after, but... Charlie! You're okay? You made it. You gotta hurry. That Bea, she thinks she can make a deal. She wants to try and trade your son to the Goblin so she'd get hers back. What are you talking about? That Goblin keeps the babies' souls in the spirit world and slowly feeds on them like a spider. That's what they wanna do with Nathan. This will kill it. But we gotta get it right in his heart. And we gotta go do it right now. Where is this all going down? The only place it could. Where it all started. Come to us. Come to us, tortured spirit. Goblin! We have what you want. You know how to use this? Yes, sir. We should probably split up and come at it from different directions. It might help to confuse him. Okay, we'll go this way. Goblin. A child for a child. Show me my baby. Show me my Ben. I beg of you. Ben! Ben. It's your mama. No! No! No! Give me my baby. I want my baby! I want my baby. Come on, Bea. Okay, come on. Run to the cabin, Nikki. Run! Charlie, now! No! No! Run. Get the spear. Nikki, Nikki. Dad, we gotta go. Dad, we gotta go. Kyle? You saw what happened. This thing works. You're wasting time. We need to go. What about that kid? What about that ghost or whatever that thing was? I think there's more of them inside that thing. I'm not endangering my children. You don't have to. I can do this myself. No, you can't. You remember what Charlie said? What? He said, "I can't do this alone. " I don't think anyone can. All right. Come on. In the house. Let's go. Okay, so it wants Nathan. So, Nikki, I need you to wait right here, okay, so it can see you. Kyle, I want you to wait right here. And when I give you the word, I want you to take Nikki and Nathan out of here, okay, son? Give me the spear. All right, I'm entrusting you with the lives of my children, you understand? Yes, sir. Okay, good. I guess we're bait after all, hey, buddy? I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, I promise. Come on. Let's just get this over with. I can smell him. He's close. Nikki, do you see anything? Nothing. Come on, Nikki. Kyle! Come on. Come on. Come on. No, Dad! Dad! It's okay, buddy. Nikki. Dad.
