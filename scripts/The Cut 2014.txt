Christian and Muslim men over the age of 15 are required to fight. You're a soldier now. - Right now? - Rakel! Wait. Wait. Instead of me, would you take this? What are you waiting for? Shoes on. - Move it! Come on! - Get going! Get moving! Come on! Why aren't you working! Hey, you! You dog! Work! Gel up and work, you son of a bitch! Work! Get up! Work! Get up! Work! Come on! Work! Don't talk! Get back! Heathen! Come here, kid! Hey, sit down! Hrant! He needs to get back to work. He's sick, sir. He's yellow. Either he works or he dies. Just a minute. Have mercy. Get him on his feet. Salaam alaikum, soldiers. Here! Eat! Apricots! Take them! Armenians! Listen! I'm here to represent the Governor of Diyarbakir. He offers all of you his mercy as well as freedom. Any crimes you have committed will be pardoned in his name. He who sees the light and converts to the religion of Islam will be released immediately. Those who wish to save themselves, step forward. Come on! Step forward! Give me that Mauser. Get rid of the body so no one sees it! Tie them together! I said lie them together! This is the place! Stop! Turn them to face the wall! Kneel down! Kneel down, I said! Don't waste any bullets! CUT him! Cut! Cut him! Cut! - I killed him, he's mine! - Fuck you. Enough of that! Drink. Your scarf. Come on. Get up. You'll die if you stay here. Come with me. Come on! What are you doing? I've never killed anybody. I was hungry, so I stole. They put me in prison with these animals. Then they released us. To kill you people. Come with me. Come with me. Come. My name is Mehmet. Hurry up, come on. Get some rest. Armenian. Wake up. Come on. Come on. Drink. Come on. Come on. Try to walk. Be careful. Drop everything you've got and go! Are you deserters? We're not soldiers. We're running from the war. We are deserters. Do you have anything of value? What's your name, pal? He can't speak. Dursun. You're condemned to silence, pal. Piss on your scarf, tie it up and let it heal. Where are you going! Nowhere. Can we go with you! Stop! Stop! - What are you doing? - Waiting for you. Clear off! Leave your weapons and horses and go! Stay here! I paid you in gold! Stay! Do you know him? Of course. We're from Mardin. Shut up! Shut up! On the wagon! Leave them some food, they have kids. Think you'll find your family! Wait! Dursun, bring those clothes. Ras al-Ayn is three days' walk. Do you know the way! Hide your cross. It's healing. Somebody give him water. Use it wisely. Wear these. You'll attract less attention. Good luck. Forgive me. Stay inside! Slowly! What do you want? Come inside. Women, fetch something to eat! Go inside! I'm not giving her away. You want to know where I got the girl? From Ras al-Ayn. Ras al-Ayn! Hey, you rabble! Get off my tracks! Back to your camp! Move it! Here. What's wrong, brother? What are you doing here? Do you speak Arabic? So? Answer. Who did that to you! Talk. Armenian? Armenian. Papers! Papers. Here, please. - Omar Nasreddin? - Yes. - What's in the vessels? - I sell soap. Fragrant. It's fragrant. Keep it. The whores of Aleppo will thank you. Move along! Yes, sir. Come, come, Asisa. Ali! Riza! - Salaam alaikum, Grandfather. - Wa alaikum salaam, Grandson. Thanks be to God, you're safe here. I have a surprise here. He's Armenian and mute. Give him something to drink. This way! He's mute, not deaf. Take him inside and give him water. Where are you from, silent one? From where? What? What? MARDIN I can't read. This is Krikor, an Armenian like you. Take care of him. That's not necessary. Good night. The Near Eastern Relief Organization offers free accommodation to refugees at Omar Nasreddin's Soap Factory. No soap production at present. Brother, I beg you. Don't bring me any more refugees. I have no more space to rent to you. Look. See with your own eyes. Is there space here? No. Where should I put them? Please try to find another place to rent, I beg you. There's no space. Look at this. Look. Otherwise, diseases will breakout. What can I do? I can do nothing for you. Stop pestering me! Leave me alone! Master Nazaret. Stay safe. May Allah protect you. Take this, you might need it. Hey, what are you doing here? What's going on? Are you sleeping? Go swab the deck in first class! Where are you going! Back there! You may clean up now. It's Cuba! I don't think that address is near here. Look at the beautiful flowers, sir. I don't know that address, sorry. But do you want some flowers? No, we don't know it. Sorry. But good luck anyway! Yes, go to the end of the street and then left. It's that way. There! At the end of the street! There, you fool. I'm closing. That's 12 centavos, please. I MUST LOOK FOR MY DAUGHTERS IN MINNEAPOLIS. ITS THE ONLY HOPE I HAVE! I can get him to America for 100 dollars-. Has he got it? I'll give you 50. I could use the space he takes for more rum. He only has a small arse. He won't take up much space. Fair enough. Let's say 80. And I'll shave you for free for one year. Deal. Coalman! Coalman! Ten kilograms! What are you doing? Help! Robbery! Help! Thief! Grab the boxes, grab the rum! Move it! Move it!
