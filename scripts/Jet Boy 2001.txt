He wants to hang out with all that big kids. Last week, he invited this boy to a supper and I swear ... ... it was like the Pope coming to dinner - the way Lloyd behaved. It was Wendy Ferguson's son Clay. He will be sixteen in October. And you will not gonna believe what I caught him doing in the bathroom last week. You know. I think I have to tie his hands behind his back so he doesn't injure himself. Maybe you should talk to him. Why? From what you already told me he already has his techniqe done! Boon, I'm serious. Does Nathan? I think he's well beyound all that. Well? Put some sugar. To make it smoother a little bit. They're coming! Nathan! We are heading now. Want to to go with them? You will not like it, Mam. Its just dumb asses and drug dealers. Really? Then why don't you guys go watch the movie ... ... and ask all folks go sit on their swing and drink lemonade... Good idea, mam. Hey. I want to treat Lloyd. Let's see how fast you can spend that. But its five bucks just to get in! Since when? Always. And leave that . My old man always made me bring my own.

Why not go with them later? Why yes. Ya, let's go. Come on! So you came here to see your grandfather? Yep. I think he's dying or something. Do not talk about it. The old man Palmer. You know him? Everyone knows everyone in this town. Can get all scary sometimes. Whats your point? Let's put it this way. I don't think he will be missed.. Why didn't your Mam come with you? She gets car sick. You know they used to grow up? My mam and your dad. I know. Did he loved her?? How am I supposed to know? Yah, I guess so. It's hard to know with Boon. Not with my mam. I wish you guys stay longer. Me too. I do not think this is such a good idea. They are cool, Nathan. Well, they didn't look so cool. They got a car. What more do you want? Hi is drunk. So what? Drop the damn bottle down, Dennis.

You suppose you can do better? Just about anyone could do better. Do it, hot shot! On the paper, not in my eyes. So what else you do well? Your old man got any job? It doesn't look like he does. All the dress of you. We make you said that. What does he do, exactly? He is a tattoo artist. Shure he is! Cool. I got it for my birthday. You promised me a lemonade. My - it's right. I did. You did!

If it makes you feel any better, the guy who made it went to jail. A long time ago. I want to see that movie. Tomorrow night it's half price. We're leaving in the morning. I get pissed whenever I want to. I have to hide in the corner of nowhere. Lloyd is happend fun. Well he drunk his first beer - what do you expect? Your eyes gonna burn a hole right trough me. Your tattoo. Did it hurt? A little. Well, a lot. Nathan. I live still with my mam. It turn her on if I wached. It turn her boyfriends too. Sometimes I wanna feel all this stuff.
