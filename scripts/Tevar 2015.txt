Are you two have having an affair? Stupid girl... we're not a couple. Please don't step out of the room. Stay here. Please arrange for some clothes. Clothes? What's going on here? Tell me.

Are you crazy? Why would I go? I'll get trapped if I do. - Pintu, she's our guest. - So? Fine, I'll tell papa. He'll get something for all three. I'll get something to eat. Just get her some clothes. Okay. Do you like yellow? Where were you all day? Practicing Kabaddi. You practiced all day. I was wandering around. Did you do something you shouldn't have? There's rice and curry. Take it. And Pintu, next time you decide to wander around.. ...then don't forget to inform me. When children stay out of the house without informing" ...it scares the hell out of the parents. Sorry, Papa- Freshen up. It's like... take your eyes off, and accidents occur. What happened, Baingan? You left... but we got stuck yesterday. There was a big jam. Someone made off with strongman Gajender's girl yesterday" There was a stir in the entire city. The highway was jammed too. You know, Pintu, whoever did it.. ...must be really amazing. He's really got balls of steel. I did it! What? I did it! What nonsense. There was a problem at the bus station. I didn't know he was Gajender Singh. Problem.. You just doomed us all. - I didn't do it intentionally. He was dragging her, and I punched him. We're doomed. And the girl. - Be respectful. - Pintu. Well... she's hiding in my room. - Your home. You hid her in your home. Are you crazy? I don't plan to settle down with her. I'll take her to Delhi on Monday. We'll collect her passport, drop her at the airport. End of story. What "End of story"? And Gajender? There's no point in locking horns with him. - He's right. We'll all be in trouble. Listen to us. - Are you scared? - Yes. Me too. Did we ever lose as a team? Did we ever lose as a team? No. We're the Attitude. We'll get through this. We'll get through. Fine... we'll get through. Kakdi! - Kakdi! - Yes, brother. Brother. Where's brother? - He's gone to Agra. To attend a rally. - Sit. - Yes. The peace, and sanctity in our state, in your state.. ...how does it prevail? Because our government is in power here. Your government. We work hard day and night. What for? For your happiness. Your happiness is.. Stop all this. Stop it. Don't you get it? Get lost. Your prosperity is.. Brother. Just one minute. Well... my name is Gajender Singh, and I belong from Mathura. My brother, this one here.. "Has been the Home Minister of this state for four years. And my cousin is the MP here. That means... l am the One.. You see... l was supposed to get married. And some obnoxious guy.. ...made off with your future sister-in-law. Get lost. Keep your eyes and ears open.. ...and find your daughter-in-law. Right? If we find the girl.. ...then, everyone's invited to the wedding. And don't leave without eating, or I'll feel offended. And if she's not found.. ...then I'll be your one and only son-in-law. And lay my cot wherever I like. Right? Do you want to say something? So... we're going to have a rally. Come on. Get to work, come on.. Move. Move. Stop playing. What are your hobbies? What are we doing here? Papa's at home today. So it's a bit tense at home. I don't want any trouble before your flight. Isn't it amazing... The Taj. You know what's strange. So many Indians have still not seen the Taj. - Lam one of them. - What? You haven't seen the Taj yet. That's the problem with us locals. Everyone wants to go to London or New York. But no one wants to see the beauty in our country. I didn't want to go either. But brother was adamant on sending me.. Now that I am going, he's no more. Why? Can I ask you something? What do you really like? Dance. Do you like 'Baingan' (Eggplant)? You don't know... how much I love you. Me too. Me too. Idiots. If father finds out you two are eyeing her.. ...then he'll be scared too. Hey you three... Pintu. Radhika. What's up? Hi. They are my friends. Ghosla, Bhatura... and he is Baingan. What kind of friends are you? You just humiliate me anywhere. You should first see the situation. Should I tell her your real name? - Real name? What? - Should I? - Should I start? I'll start. Ghosla. Bhatura. Now we're going to have some fun. I won't... It's alright. Switch on the generator. Ghosla, don't do it. Bhatura, shut it down. Stop it, Pintu. Let it be. Brother. Stop it. Take this. "Hey listen baby.. - Baby...!" "I'll do anything for you." "Nah... l'm just joking." "I'll even go to the moon for you." "Now get ready.." "I can't wait anymore." "I just wanna party... hard." "Like an animal." "I see her dancing... she looks outstanding." "She's got no love... or passion." "For you all this was a fashion." "Pretty blue colored jeans." "And blue colored shirt." "You made my heart freeze." "You look like Dutch police." "Let's celebrate.." "Let's celebrate this moment." "Moment...!" "Let's Instagram this." "Let's Instagram this moment." "Moment...!" "I just want to live this moment." "They call me the mood mechanic." "And I'm going to fix you." "These days everyone wanna be rappers."

"Let's Instagram this moment." "Moment...!" Don't scream, Gajender. What else should I do? Where is baby? She was last spotted on Mathura-Agra highway. You claim to be the Home Minister. Your love's going to cost me my future. And I won't let that happen. Starting from now, you won't touch anyone. You want to marry her, don't you? I'll do something. One has to do illegal things legally out here. Do you get that? - Kakdi. - Yes. Tell that cop to call all the cops" ...of the neighboring cities. - Yes. We'll make some arrangements. Okay? Now wear your pants. Wear your pants. I've had enough of your love. People take their pants off when they get a girl. But he'll wear his when we find the girl. Why don't you take part in the dance show? Yes. Right. Why don't I? - Come, I'll tell you. Have you seen your face? - Thank you. - What for? You did everything to make me smile, right? No... This is what I do when I am free. I mean... all the time. I forgot to ask, where's your visa application slip? I guess I left it home in a haste. What now? I'll go to Mathura and get it. Bhatura, I'm going to Mathura tomorrow. Pintu. You've made it your mission" ...to send me to the US, right? Pinky. Where are you going now? - Meeting. I've to go. Go back inside.

Mathura? Lam heading that way too, I'll drop you. Come on, hurry up. Alright. Is everything okay? Pintu's there. He'll handle everything. Does this all belong to Pintu? - Yes. But why does he play Kabaddi? There are other things. He says, real champions don't send players out of the field. In fact, they come back home. By the way. What's his real name? Ghanshyam, where are you headed? - He's talking to you. - Yes, sir. Ghanshyam! Ghanshyam? - Don't know about Ghanshyam, but Pintu.. Oh no! Where are you headed? Tell me. - Anywhere but here. - What? I mean some place.. - So you're SP Shukla. - Manners" lam Kakdi. I didn't ask your name. You need to learn some manners. Are you alone? No. The Prime Minister's with me. Would you like to meet him? This is not the time to joke. Where's the meeting? Come. Chaubey, let's go. Even he... my brother said everything will be fine. But nothing happened.
