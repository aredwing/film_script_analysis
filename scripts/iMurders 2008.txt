Who is that? - I'm his wife. - What? - You said you were divorced. - Oh, he will be. - Let's just talk. - No more chances. I don't know why I keep doing this. - I swear she means nothing to me. - You asshole! You threw away I'm so sorry. You can say goodbye to your house, your kids. No, please. I am nothing without my family. You should've thought of that before you brought this tramp into our lives! Tramp? You have no idea... - Hey, do you need a hand with this? - No no, I think I've got it. Thanks. Is there a problem in the building? No, I've got a friend who lives up there. Yeah? Hi, this is Sandra Wilson. I'm looking for Miss Jensen. She's supposed to let me into my apartment. Fifth floor, first door on your left. - Thank you. - Oh! - Oh, I'm sorry. No no, sorry, it's me. I've been a bit jumpy lately. Well, these are the last of them. Oh. You can just put them here. Thank you so much. - You did not have to do that. - Well, it's the least I can do, seeing how I gave the handyman the day off. I don't know where my mind is some days. - Ooh, let me help you with that. - Thank you. Tsk. My my. - What a beautiful machine. - Oh, thank you. - Are you into computers? - Me? Not really. I'm more your pen-and-paper kind of gal who hides her money in her mattress. Besides, I really think it's a shame that they're turning us all into something we're not. - Don't you? - No, I think they're the best. Maybe I'll show you a few things sometime. - It'll make you feel more comfortable. - That would be very nice of you. You'd be amazed at what you can do. Hell, I even found this apartment through it. How did you do that? One of my FaceSpace friends turned me on to it-- knew someone who knew someone else. Face..Space? Oh. Yeah. See? We have a lot of ground to cover. - I'm afraid we do. Well... welcome. Thank you. Thanks again for your help. No worries. Any word? Well, have a seat over there. What is taking so long? - I just expect something. - And you deserve it. - What's this? - lnterrogatories. In English, Robert. A bunch of questions you're gonna have to answer for the defense attorney. Well, didn't I tell them enough already? I filled out all the paperwork. I've told them what happened to me. Well, that was a certification that goes with the complaint. They're not just going to roll over and die, Lindsay. Yeah, well, I might as well have. But you didn't. You're alive. And you're going to get what's coming to you, but it's going to take some time. Okay, I'm on it. Sandra? It's Christine. Come on in. Okay. - Hi. - I figured that you'd be too busy to make yourself supper, so I made you a little something. Oh, aren't you a doll? Here. It's just some pasta with a little garlic and oil and some salad. And please, if you've already eaten, you could heat this up tomorrow. Are you kidding? My PC's up and running, but my pots and pans probably won't be unpacked for a couple of weeks. Ooh, that smells good. - Thank you. - Enjoy. You want to stay? I mean I was just about to go online, but-- If I'm not disturbing you. To tell you the truth, I would really love the company. I will grab you a glass of wine. So tell me about yourself. I see you're single. Do you date much? - Oh God, I'm sorry. People say that I can be a bit of a busybody. It's okay. I guess I am flying solo for now. Okay. There we go. - "FaceSpace." - Yeah, it's unbelievably addictive. Okay, just one click and we are in. - What is all this? - This is my personal profile. It has my blogs, photos, personal stats so people can take a look at my page and then request to be on my friends network. See? I have over 1,000 friends on my network. It might get a bit cramped if you decide to have a housewarming party. Well, I don't know most of them. There are a few of us, though, that go into a special room to chat. You want to see? Oh, it's perfect timing. - I'm Sassy Planner, because I do meeting planning for a living. Some of us have microphones so we can talk to each other without having to type, and some of us even have webcams so we can see each other. - See? - That's amazing. Welcome to my cyberworld. Really? Why should l? - What's in it for me? Michael, I'm gonna watch a movie. Do you want to join me? I can't right now, darling. I have to prepare a lecture for tomorrow morning. Okay. What did I miss? - So there are seven of you? - Eight, actually. We all got tight through our FaceSpace friends network, - so we started our own little group. - Oh. Hi, honey. - That's Mark. He does special effects makeup in the movies He hosts our room and emcees the game that we play. Hi, sweetie. Here, get in front of the camera so they can say hi. - No no no, I-- - Oh, come on. My hair's a mess. No no, come on. - Where's Velvet? - She had class. - She's probably running late. - Velvet? Velvet50-- one of the gals in chat. I've been meaning to meet up with her. She's the one who turned me on to this apartment. Oh. Well, then we like Velvet50. Lindsay: Hey, Mark, did you guys have fun - when she came out there? - Oh yeah, we did. She's a handful. A fun gal. Did get a little freaky when she talked about her relationship with her brother. - Listen to me. Poor guy's barely cold in the ground. So, Mark, do you have something exciting - on tap for us? - You need excitement, baby? - Come on over to Bigstuff. - Pfft. Please. Now now, sugar. You be nice to Beauty. When you're ready to be bad, you can come and play in my den, baby. That's MeltNurMouth-- she's a phone sex operator. Not that this little game of seduction isn't yummingly stimulating-- even for a queen like me-- but I do believe that it's time to get this month's game off the ground, - don't you? Every month we play some kind of challenge or game that Mark thinks up-- crazy scenarios that play out over the course of the month-- - and Mark he goes all out. - That sounds like fun. Yeah, and whoever wins gets a prize-- usually some kind of cool movie memorabilia. Oh, actually I just won recently. Look at this. This is the menu that John Travolta and Uma Thurman look at in "Pulp Fiction." - $5 shake. Remember that? - Wow. So after years of fighting this with my last breath, I'm ashamed to admit that I have been bitten by the reality-television bug. Heaven help me. So I decided to incorporate a little bit of that into this month's extravaganza. - Oh, no. I know. I know. And since this month ends in my most favorite holiday-- Halloween-- I thought we can use a little bit of that macabre... flavor, if you will. - So this month we'll have a little bit of bloody intrigue... - Really? - ...a tinge of theater... and yes-- dare I say? --a little sprinkling of that "Survivor" mentality. Ready to play? Then here are the rules. - What's up, slick chick? - I'm late. - For what? - Well, for class, obviously. That's obvious from your library cache of books. Those are big words for a janitor. lf you don't want what I've got, fine. No no, what-- what you got? I'm listening. Nah. Huh-uh, you first. - Me first about what? - About my deal. Oh, no, baby. You ain't getting none of this. - I don't want none of that. - Yes, you do. - Maybe I do. - Uh-huh. - Listen, what I want is knowledge. - Knowledge? Yeah, computer knowledge-- just like yourself. - Ah. Now that I can help you with. - Yeah. But first I want to know what's going on in that building. I want you to know, Amy, that this is good work-- very good work-- but it's mechanical. Mechanical? I don't understand. Well, there's a lot of citation and you show tremendous insight, but what I'm not hearing is your voice, you know? Your voice. I tried. I know you tried. It's obvious you tried, but I want you to try again-- this time with passion. - Yes, Professor. - Good. Now show me what you've got. You know, I always did have a thing for a brilliant mind. You don't say? Have a beautiful day, Amy. Ah. Miss Mulroney. I trust everything went well last evening? It was wonderful. I really feel like I'm starting to get my message across. Fantastic. That calls for a celebration. Well, I tried calling you at home last night... - ...to discuss a problem - I'm having with one of my students. - Oh, really? - Mmm. - What time was that? - I don't know-- 9:00ish? - Ah. Bad timing. Oh, that's right. Heaven forbid I try to call you during your precious chat night. Are you jealous of my cyberbuddies, Allie? Well, if you want role-playing, Michael, - all you have to do is ask. - All done, Professor. Ah. Have a good day, Jerry. Have a nice afternoon. Well, that was subtle. I thought we agreed to be discreet? Well, it's hard to put the milk back into the carton after you've already had the cereal. Oh, dear. A cereal analogy. Pink flag-- quite alarming. But I realize the last time you were involved in something like this, things got a bit... messy. "Messy"? Well, that's an interesting choice of words. What do you want from me, Allie? More. I don't get how you can talk to these kids all day long about intimacy when you spend the majority of your time communicating in cyberspace. My cyberworld is my business. But if I were you, I wouldn't worry. You see, I have some very provocative plans for you, Allie. Well, I am all ears, Professor. I think we both know better than that. Why don't you get the door, Miss Mulroney? I-- I think this is yours. Oh, yeah. - You're dropping citrus. - Thanks. Yeah, well, usually I throw rose petals, but you kind of caught me off guard. Well, have a good one. Oh, yeah, you too. Thanks. - Hey. - Hi. Who was that? Oh, that's Joseph Romano. He's really a nice man. He keeps mostly to himself, though. - Yeah, I see that. - I think he lived here about a year. You know, he suffered a terrible loss. You know, he was a policeman. Now he really just spends most of his time in his apartment all alone. - Mmm. - It's really a shame. Yeah. Yes, it is. Are you tapping to a song, Janet? Uh, no. - In a rhythm of sorts? - Sort of. - A numerical rhythm? - Yes. - You know that. - I do? Yes, you do. - Okay. - You want to know the numbers? Is it five taps, then four taps and then repeated over and over again? No. It's not about my mother. Now why would I think that five taps and then four taps equates to your mother? Because her birthday is May 4th. That's what the tapping used to be. That's when I was afraid she was going to die. And tapping the number of her birthday would stop her death from happening? Can we get to the point, Dr. St. Martin? Can we? I'm tapping six six six. What could that stop? What can it start? So where is our esteemed master of ceremonies now? Evening, one and all. And what a perfect night for our festivities. Now I know you all are just dying to play this month's little game. And I have to admit I'm a tad excited myself. All right, let's play. Easy there, big boy. Yeah, Bigstuff, keep it in your pants. But we can't start without Sassy. So how's that new class of yours, Velvet? - Oh! - Clarence. Naughty boy. Easy there, big boy. I'm fine. Ahem. I'm fine. - Sorry, everyone. I couldn't make it back in time. I've got to go wireless. Okay, everyone, remember the rules: The first person to guess the horror film that I've selected wins this month's grand prize. Now you may ask me anything for a clue and I will instant-message you if you are correct. But... if you type or say the magic word that I have randomly selected, then you are eliminated from the game and will meet a ghastly end, never to be seen again-- at least until the end of the contest. That includes no blogging or instant-messaging outside of this room. No cheating. No exceptions. And remember... I am everywhere. Ready? Then let's begin. - Help! Really, Mark. - Wait a minute, sport. - Help! Help! You haven't told us what the prize is yet. Delightful. - I'll get on that right away. - Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. - Did you take a little trip? - Oh yeah, just a work thing. So I see you were talking to the hunky neighbor. Oh, yeah, he certainly is handsome. lf I were only 10 years younger. Oh, stop. You're lovely. - Were you ever married? - Me? Oh, I'm afraid not. - How come? - I guess you'd have to blame it on William. Oh, this sounds interesting. How so? He was amazing. He was athletic, smart, kind. He loved his family. He was everything a girl could want in a man. Sounds almost too good to be true. No. Not William. I miss him. He passed on a little while ago and... it was such a waste. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry too. Hey, I see that you have your eye on that hottie neighbor. Yeah, he's pretty cute. He certainly is. Hey, I was wondering if maybe you would give me another computer lesson-- - I mean when you're free, of course. - Oh, yeah. You want to come by tonight around 7:00 or so? - 7:00 would be great. - Okay. Hey, Joseph was mentioning to me about desserty-type menus. Maybe he's in the mood for a snack break. Oh. Thank you. Unannounced-- I love it, Lindsay. - Do you have some news for me? - Yeah, well, that club where you were attacked may settle. What? Well, we've got better experts. We can show that their security system failed. A standard metal detector should've picked up his knife. Well, that's fu-- he should be paying me. Yes. He caused your injuries. "Injuries"?! This isn't just an injury! My face was my living! It was everything! Now look at me! Well, now we've got over $1 million coming to us from that dance club. As a matter of fact, I'm going out of town to execute the settlement. Lindsay's voice: No! No! No. No no no no! No. It is your fault. Why weren't you here? Why weren't you here? It is your fault. Got milk? I heard rumors of cookie famine running rampant on this side of the hallway. I figured I would do my part. Well, I-- I think we've got it handled on this side. - Thanks. - Well-- wait. Are you kidding me? These are 100% Grade A fresh-out-of-the-oven Angelo's cookies. Most tenants would give their eye teeth for a couple of these puppies but I came to you. This should at least earn me an introduction. - You want to come in? - I would love to. The place is a little-- let me just-- we had a-- - a party-- birthday-- - No, it's-- it's nice. Oh, that's funny. The cleaning lady was arrested, and she never came back. - Ah. Don't you hate when that happens? - It's a long story. So across the hall you're from, yeah? - Your name? - Oh, I'm Joe... Romano. - Joe? - Yeah. - See? That wasn't so hard. - Mm-hmm. Another potential disaster avoided. - Wow, that's a big one. Mmm. - Yeah. - Wow. - Good, huh? - That is good. - Thanks. - I'm Sandra. - I'm still Joe. Oh. Like I said-- eye teeth. - Oh, this is beautiful. - Whoa whoa whoa! Don't touch that! - Sorry. - It's all right. I just-- I don't want to scare you or anything, it's just that it's wet and a client's coming by to pick it up in about an hour. Oh, it's okay. - How long have you been doing this? - Not-- not too long. - Yeah, since I retired. - Retired? You're a little young to be retired. What did you do? Yeah, well, I'm not that young, but... You know, Sandra, I-- I'm up to my eye teeth here in work, and I don't want to be rude or anything, but I've just-- I'm really busy. It's okay. I understand. Only so much hospitality I can take in one day anyway. Enjoy. I didn't mean to be rude, I'm just-- - No. - Thank you again. - Hey. - Sorry, my ears aren't really picking up - the asshole frequency today. - I was a cop... before I retired. It's painful. The sixes? No. That's a relief. Tell me about what they mean. No. I'm not ready. I'm not sure. I need to think. Then think. I love you. I know. I'm stuck. On what? On something I've never told you about before. - May I join you, Miss Mulroney? - Absolutely, Michael. I thought you might care for a caf au lait. - Oh, that's very nice of you. - How about a bite of my sandwich? - Gerald! - Yes, Michael? - I was wondering if you could - stand in for me tomorrow? - Which class? - History of the American Novel. - And what are you currently lecturing on? The "lost generation," of course-- specifically Hemingway's vivid portrayal of it in "A Movable Feast." - Hedonist. - You're just jealous. - You owe me one. All right. So how are you handling your course load? I think I'm handling it quite well. - Don't you? - Allie, please. We're right out here in the open. Relax, Michael. There is no one around. You are dangerous... - ...and I like it. I really like it. So I presume everything is set for tomorrow? Yes, Michael. lf I'm one thing, I'm thorough. Thorough and predatorial, l'd say. Mmm. I just love doing your dirty work. Well, dirty is your specialty, isn't it, darling? - You bastard. - Allie, please. I know that you've done a lot for me these past few weeks, but I assure you-- when this is over you and I shall have an eternity to play. You know, Michael, I don't really have any doubts about our future together. 'Cause if not, I'm not going to be the one who needs to worry. - Mmm. - Absolutely predatorial. - That's my girl. - Hey, everybody. - Hi there, sugar. Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm just dying to get started. Me too. But I was wondering-- now that Mark is gone, how is he going to monitor the game? Huh. I didn't think of that. But remember-- he's everywhere. Why so quiet, Sassy? Sorry. I'm here. So how are we going to play the game? Ah. - Hello there, baby. - Nice try. Bravo. I was wondering how you were going to play this. So now you're the MysteryRightr, huh? I love a man with a good mind. Oh no, don't be like that. You know, you're slipping, sport. What if somebody's already said the magic word that seals their fate? Hi. I just-- I just wondered if my handsome husband wanted to take a break from chatting - and get some dessert? - Certainly, dear. - Now? - I'll be right out. Don't be too long. - What did I miss? - It's Velvet. She's a goner. Good. Two down, five to go. It happened again. - What? - Huh. How would you put it? Destructive behavior. Therapy. I'm not sure those two can be achieved simultaneously. Maybe not. What is it that you never told me before? I might be ready. Then explain. It's noises-- sounds, voices. From where? Those noises I can't get out of my head. That eerie, horrible sound ringing out-- I hear it over and over. The sixes give me quiet, though... and hope. So does the computer chatroom. That was always April's thing, not mine. April? Who is she? She was everything to me. She was a lover? Yes. I loved her, and more than you could ever understand. I see. So she broke your heart? Many times, but that's not what the sixes are about... or the computer chatrooms that I have joined. So what was the sixes for? April's dead. She could spend hours at a time on FaceSpace, especially chat night. Must have had 10,000 requests to add to her friends list. - A lot of men? - Men, women, whoever. Everybody was attracted to April. I began to suspect she was having an affair because she was so drawn to it. Was she? She was killed going to meet someone from a chatroom. Her family got a huge insurance settlement. I got nothing. So you wanted money? I just wanted April, but somebody else got her. I spent a year on that site searching for answers as to what was so worth losing her life for. Now though... I've got the sixes. And you think the sixes and this chatroom are where you will discover what you need to stop the noises that haunt you? My hope is that soon they will be silenced forever. - Are you going on a trip? - Hmm? - Your bags. - Oh, yeah. A work thing. - Ah. What do you do? You didn't tell me what you did. I'm an event planner. Okay. You mean weddings, bar mitzvahs and stuff like that? No no, much more exciting than that. I do corporate events. I go to whatever city an event's planned in - and I do onsite inspections. - Ah, so you're always traveling. Yeah, I've run up a frequent-flier mile or two. - Mmm. - But I want to hear more about you. What's the secret behind my furniture-making, ex-crime-fighting neighbor? - This is good. - Good. What do you want to know? Mmm, the possibilities. Let's start with how you became a cop. Uhh... family business. My two grandfathers were cops, my pop. My sister's an FBI agent. My brother's the local PD. And my brother Bobby was killed in the line of duty. - I'm sorry. - Yup. Well, I see you brought two bottles of wine. - I did. - Are you trying to get me drunk? Maybe. No, you know, I was going to do the flowers thing, but everybody does that. I was going to get roses. I don't know. Maybe you're allergic to roses, so... my sister said to bring wine. I didn't know if you liked red or white, so I brought both. - Do you like ros? - I like it all. You like it all. - Let's open the red. - Yeah. Yeah, this is really good. - I don't know. - Mmm, it is. - Let me help you. - Thank you. - Can you get it? - Mm-hmm. The top of the hour and all the news around the world in just two minutes. First up, how about a real Hollywood horror? In Los Angeles, a 38-year-old man was found was found mutilated - in his West Hollywood loft. - We don't need to hear that. - Yeah, we don't. - Sorry, Professor. - That's all right, Jerry. - Here we go. - Thank you. Hey, what's that gizmo? This is a BlackBerry. It's my phone, but I just sent an instant message. And you can check your emails, you can check stock quotes. It is my link to the outside world when I'm out and about. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in the 19th century. No, it's not that bad. You do know about that machine that instantly cooks frozen food, though, right? Oh, yes, I think I may have heard of that. Tell me what you want. You know what I want, baby. - Mmm, good. - Oh, yeah. - Give it to me one time. - Baby. You feel so good. Yes. Yes! - Give it to me hard! - Oh, yes. - Oh yes, baby! - I'm all in! Yes! Yes! - Oh, baby! - Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes! Oh, baby, you were so good. Thank you, darling. So were you. - Talk with you soon. - Can't wait, baby. Well, look who's here. Ah. Looks like our fearless leader has finally arrived. Hi there, sugar. Love the new name. Mark, I have the first question. Mmm, I rather like playing with fire. - You are so bad. I know I'm not supposed to bother you, Mom, but my legs are hurting. Could you come rub them for me? Sure, baby. I'll be down in just a minute. Well, folks, looks like I've got to take myself out of the running. Are you sure you want to do that? There's this handsome young man here who's in serious need of some TLC. I brought party favors. Coming, Ryan! It's almost over. What is? The noises. I'm intrigued. I got a gun. Tell me everything, Janet. I want to help you, but there are limits to a doctor-patient relationship. You've been a very big help, Doctor. Maybe you can help me some more. - Just give me a second - and I'll be done with this, Lori. - It looks beautiful. But Joe, we have more serious things to talk about, huh? - All right. Be right back. - Coming. - Hi. - Hi. Ah, wine. This is not a good time right now. Oh. I see. Who the hell is that? That's-- no no, that's not-- that-- - you're making a mistake! - Bullshit! - Huh. "Bullshit." "Bullshit." Don't say it. - Hello. - Hi. May I help you? I'm sorry. I'm not just being nosy, I'm the landlord. Oh, no problem. I was just visiting Joe. I thought Joe had a girlfriend-- one right here in the building. Don't worry. I'm not his girlfriend. Good evening. Good evening. All right, listen up, people. You will have two hours to take this exam. Now I advise you all to keep your minds open, your thoughts flowing and your pencils moving. l'd wish you all luck, but I'm afraid luck can't save you now. - Everybody ready? - All: Yes. Eyes to the front. - Begin. Oh, that's quite a sense of humor you have there. Come again? That little message you sent me on my computer. Allie: I have no idea what you're talking about. "I know what you're up to"? Are you telling me you didn't send me that message? No, I didn't, but actually it's not such a bad idea. It might be a little reminder for you to keep being a good little boy throughout all of this. This isn't very funny, because if you didn't send me that message, that means that whoever did is onto us. Do you have any idea what that means? Of course I do, Professor. The price of poker just went up. Have a nice day, Miss Mulroney. We are live at Englewood Court where this story of a gruesome death of a 43-year-old resident is just beginning to unfold. The victim identified as Wanda Jennings is a stay-at-home mom of an afflicted 6-year-old boy who was ritualistically murdered in the attic of her home while her son played in a downstairs room. With me now is Christopher Mayo, a neighbor of the deceased. Tell us something about Wanda Jennings. She was just a real nice lady, you know? She always had a friendly smile on her face. It's just tough. The kid was like her whole world, you know? He's been sick-- I can't even remember how long, but she just decided to give up her job - and take care of the kid. - She didn't work? Christopher: She used to drive a semi or something like that but the kids started really bothering him at school, so she just-- one day she just quit and decided to home-school him. She, umm-- oh, I think she started doing an internet business. I had heard something about that, but I don't know. - It's-- it's just such a shame. - Jennifer: Thank you. This is Jennifer Singer, CBJ News. Hmm. Okay. "When will you be back?" "Yes." "Me too." Hey, Jimmy, thanks for coming. Say hello to your father for me. Absolutely. Thanks a lot, Mr. R. - Here, let me get that. - Oh, thanks. - Take care. - You too. - Hi. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Can I help you? Umm... - I'm not really sure, actually. - Hey hey hey. - You know this pretty girl? - Yeah, Pop, I know a pretty girl. Madonne! You're doing good, kid. - Hey, you're killing my rep here, pal. - That's not hard, junior. Okay. Sandra, this is my father. This is Sandra. - I told you about her. - It's so nice to meet you, Mr. Romano. Oh, any friend of my son's can call me Carmine. Okay, nice to meet you, Carmine. - I got your note. - You got my note. - It was his sister, really. - Okay, I've got it, Pop. - Pretty, huh? - Yeah, very pretty. Well, let me tell you about my son Joseph and my daughter Lori-- - two tough ones. - Okay okay okay. Okay, you want to know something about me, this is the guy. He'll tell you anything, obviously. I need to go run this outside. I like her. - I will. - You be good. - I promise. - All right. I'll be right back. - Okay. - Let me know what happens, huh? Oh, this should be fun. Oh, it will be. - What have we got? - We're gonna get him. - Is this for sure? - I think so. - This freak is going down. - All right. When's it happening? - I want to be there. - You can't. You know that. I can't even be there. It's too close. All right. How'd-- how'd you nail him? - A tip from a shrink. - A shrink. All right. - I've got somebody waiting for me. - See you, Joe. - Leave it to the FBI. I'm worried about him. You're worried about everything. - You're kidding me. - That's my boy. - Oh my God. Oh, well, the family's been through a lot lately, Joe especially. - Hmm. - How are you with a drill? - Not bad. - My drill's right there on the counter. - Okay. - Why don't you help me put this shelf up real fast and then the two of you can take off whenever Joey gets back? - All right. How come you didn't tell him about the chatroom murders? He's too fragile right now. I will when it's right. Let's just get to Boston. - "You... almost... - here?" - She has a gun! Drop the gun! - Drop the gun! - Let go of me! Let go of me! - Relax! Relax! - I need to get him! I need to get him! - He killed April! He killed April! - Let's get her out. Let's get her out. - I always wanted to say this to an attorney. - You have the right to remain silent. - You're a regular comedian. Laugh at this: Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. - Hey. - I'm so sorry about that jealous thing with your sister. No, it's-- it's okay. Listen, I want to tell you something. You wanna come in for a second? - Yeah. - Yeah. What's wrong? The FBI's arresting my brother's murderer right now. - Oh my God. - Yeah. - Well, do you want to be alone? - No no no. I want you to stay here. I want you to stay here. My-- my sister's gonna call as soon as it's done. I-- I found my brother dead. - Jesus. - Yeah. It was pretty ugly. He wasn't just killed. It was... you know, a ritualistic thing. - It was satanic. - Why? Why? 'Cause he was a detective and he-- he got real close on something. What was it? It was more-- more of a "Who-- who was it?" It was a lawyer. He would set up his victims, he would have them attacked... - What? - ...and if they lived, he would sue on their behalf. lf they died, he sued for the families. He was a sociopath. He was our lawyer. Oh my God. - Joe, I'm so sorry. - Yeah. He was our lawyer. Bobby's wife always kind of blamed me, you know? lf I had gotten there a little sooner, maybe it would've been different. - I'm so sorry. I'm not saying that, Bigstuff. I'm just saying it would be really nice if you could take it down a notch or six once in a while. - Baby-- - Really, old boy. You wouldn't want to get yourself eliminated now, would you? - Hey, Sassy. - Hi. Now all we need is Janet. Happy Halloween, folks. Can anybody tell me where Janet Ling's apartment is? Nice outfit. Hey, partner! Wait for me. - Are you all right? - Are you gonna be able to do this? - Meaning? Meaning I don't want to get shot. I know you must want to kill this lawyer. Huh. You don't understand. Oh, I understand that Janet Ling shouldn't have been arrested. After all, this freak attorney killed her girlfriend. And she led us to him. Yeah, and she was also supposed to have killed all those other people, right? Huh. I think it makes more sense that that piece-of-shit lawyer Del Gado killed them. - Don't you? - Do you? Wow. Look at this place. Meticulous joint. I don't think I could live like this. I need a place that looks like somebody actually lives there. Today's date. Maybe that was supposed to be a birthday present. Is it just a coincidence that the suspect in a serial murder case also attempts to off the guy who killed her lover? What are the odds of that? Well, I think Ling just freaked out and started killing everybody in the chatroom. I mean, that is where her girlfriend was lured from, right? Or maybe Del Gado did it. Killing is his business. No, you know what? My money's on Ling. - What? - This door. She left open a closet door as she was going out to dust a guy. Closing a closet door is the last thing on her mind. No, it doesn't fit. Look around this place. There's not a vase even slightly off center. No clothes lying around, not a book off the shelf. It's spotless. Someone this freaky clean doesn't leave a closet door open like this. What are the odds of her going out to do the guy that did her lover the same day the chatroom murderer is coming to do her? Fuck. Come on! - Shit. - Shit, we had him! I knew it! I knew it! - Romano. I'm not done yet. What's up? I'm not sure how much longer I can wait. My wife's been very demanding lately. Yeah, it's odd. Mark never misses chat night. Well, maybe that's the point-- seeing which one of us would go if Mark didn't come around for a while. - Sounds right. - You're awfully quiet tonight, Sandy. Are you afraid you might get eliminated? Ah. Looks like we already lost somebody tonight. Yeah, I guess Janet's out. I got a trace on that call-- a disposable cell. - Perfect. - It could've been from anywhere. - Yeah, of course. - Oh! Why, hello again. What a nice surprise! I am so sorry. After you left, I found out that Joseph was your brother. He's such a nice man. - Are you here to see him? - Yes, we are. Well, your timing is good-- he just went into his apartment. So is anybody else with him, ma'am? Oh, please call me Christine. When you call me ma'am it makes me feel like I should go out and buy a walker. Christine, was Joey alone? Well, as a matter of fact, he was. Sandra's out of town. Sandra's his gal pal from the building. - Which apartment is Sandra's? - Oh, she lives right past mine. I was just heading over there right now. Oh-- is everything okay? - Lori: I thought she wasn't home? - Well, she's not. Her faucet's been leaking and the handyman is out yet again. Listen, when she gets back tell her to get in touch with us as soon as possible. I will do. - Nice seeing you again. - Christine. Tell me something about my big brother's girlfriend. Well, she's very pretty. She's a real go-getter if you know the type. - I guess. - She's the type that when she wants something, she'll stop at nothing to get it. Hmm. Oh, would you listen to me? Listen to what I'm saying-- I can't stop myself. She is a lovely lovely woman. She has actually been helping me. She's training me in using computers. - Does she know a lot about computers? - Christine: Oh, yes. Sandra seems to know a lot about them. She knows clever little tricks. Well, I mean it seems that way. But then again, who am I to talk? I don't know much. She spend a lot of time alone in her apartment? Sandra? Oh no, she travels all the time. - Every couple of days it seems. - Why is that? Well, work-- I mean, or so she tells me. Why else would someone travel so frequently? Call us. The FBI? Well, that's fascinating. I just thought that you were a busybody sister. - And me? - Oh, I thought you were her lover. Or maybe a bodyguard. She's not in any trouble, is she? No, we just need to speak to her. All right. I'll make sure she gets it. - Nice to see you again. - Mm-hmm. Huh. - Hey. - Mmm. Hey. Are we done? It's completely done with Del Gado, but there may be something more. What? People are being killed in a chatroom. Okay, a chatroom. You new lady-- what kind of car does she drive? Why? What's going on? What? Sandra Wilson-- what does she drive? - Why? - Lori: Just what is it, Joey? I don't know. It's a car. It's a Camaro, I think. A Camaro. That's-- you want to tell me what the matter is? I'll be outside. What? What's going on? - Oh! - Ooh. - You scared the hell out of me. - You scare me, okay? - Yeah. Hi. - Hi. These things-- where'd you run off to? A work thing. - I thought you were off till Monday. - So did l. I got called in at the last minute to take over a program in DC. - Why? Did you miss me? - Mm-hmm. Careful there-- a girl could get carried away with all the affection you're throwing around. I did. I missed you. - I did. - Well, good. It's nice to be missed. - I wanted to ask you something. - Sure. It's about the FaceSpace chatroom that you're involved with. Uh, yeah, sure. Do we have to talk about it right now? I kind of want to take a shower, you know, wind down a little bit. Okay. - Cool? - Yeah. All right. I'll be quick. - No, take your time. Take your time. - Have a drink. Take your time. I'll be right out. Mr. Henderson? Yes, that's right. I'm Special Agent Romano. This is Special Agent Washington. We need to speak to you inside, sir. Sure. Come on in. - Thank you. - Thanks. So what can we do for the FBI? Actually, these questions may be a bit personal. lf you prefer, we can interview you alone. There are no secrets between me and my wife. Of course not. Wh-- what kind of questions do you need to ask me? Do you participate in a role-playing chatroom? - The what? - I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. - Do you have a computer, ma'am? - Yes. Well, we use it for things like bills and emailing friends and relatives. Look, we don't know anything about-- what did you call it? --role-playing chatrooms. I'm afraid you have the wrong information. Look, sir, I know this is embarrassing to talk about but the fact is that one of the participants in this chatroom, a male who goes by the username MrBigstuff08... MrBigstuff? ...logs in from a computer that's being used in this home. George, do you know anything about this? Don't be ridiculous, Margaret. It's obvious these people are here simply to stir up trouble. Not at all. This isn't about us getting into your business. And what is the point? It's people are getting systematically killed in that chatroom, so you're either a suspect or-- - Or you could be the next victim. - Oh my God. - George? - Now you listen to me and I'm going to say this for the last time: There is no one in this household that would be involved in whatever kind of depravity you're investigating. Now then, if there's nothing else, I would prefer it if you please leave. Maybe we should take a quick peek at that computer. Did I not make myself clear? Washington: George. Do you really want it to go down this way? I don't know what you think you're going to find up here. Richard must be home. That boy and his crazy music. Richard! Richard! Hey, Joey, we just got a hit on a vehicle parked outside of one of the FaceSpacers' apartments. It's Sandra Wilson's. Call me. But there's something about the words that he uses, the choices he makes, the charm and the grace in the manner he says the words he says." - Seamus: You wrote that? - I did, Grandpa. - Oh. Can I see it? - Yeah. Yeah. - That's beautiful, Kelly. - Oh, thank you. I am so glad that you came to visit me. And I'll be seeing your sister, too. - And how's that husband of hers? - The professor? - Seamus: Yes. - Kelly: The professor's good. - He's a good... professor. - Huh. All right, so take this up to the house. Oh, okay. Joe, it's me. Do you have a minute? Yeah, it's-- it's open. Come in. - Hey. - Hey. You left kind of quickly the other day. Yeah, sorry about that. Something came up. I know. I got your note. What's up? I have to show you something. All right. I'm kind of in the middle of eating, so maybe-- can it wait till later? No, we need to do this now. It needs to be right now? You all right? Come on in. It's about my chat club. What about it? We've been playing this game-- well, it started out as a game. This guy Mark, he runs the group and he sets up these competitions-- games, whatever-- every month and I thought that this was just one of those. And then I-- I was in LA-- I was reading the newspaper and I saw this. That's Mark. I mean, I never really met him in person, but to lose someone else like this-- - I was there. - What? - I saw it happen. - How? Over my webcam. I thought he was just playing a joke. I thought it was the game, but then I started getting these. This isn't a game. - Two other people have died. - I know. - What? - I know. - I know about the murders. - So you see? That's my group. I'm scared. I could be next! This person seems to know my every move! Can you help me trace these? What can we do? What is wrong with you? You're looking at me like I did this. You car was made in Boston outside one of these people's houses. - What? When? - Three days ago. - Three days ago I was in DC. - DC. Okay. My keys were here. My car was in the parking lot - the whole time. - You can prove this? All right. - I-- I-- - You can prove that? I want to help you. I do. You've got to be up front with me. You've got to tell me what's going on. Come with me. - Hey, kid. - Hey, Joe. - Leave it on the couch. - Okay. Let me show you something. - What is it? - The site I told you about. Read that. Okay. "Okay"? You really think I could be this animal? Get out. - You-- - Get out. - Joey? - Yeah. - What's happening? - I've gotta start locking that door. - Your girl not in? - No, my girl's not in. - We had a fight. - About what? About what? About this, Lori. Washington: What happened? I found some stuff in her apartment. - What kind of stuff? - Stuff. Newspaper articles and things-- something about some murders about a year ago, and then the FaceSpace murder. Joe, why didn't you tell us? You're in love. Stop. How'd you get it? - When I was with her last. - Lori: She showed them to you? No, she didn't show them to me. She took a shower and then I-- I found them hidden. - Did she see you? - Hm-mmm. She didn't see anything. Then she came in here and she was showing me some-- some emails and some texts that were threats and she's afraid, man. This woman is afraid that she might be next. And you think it's her, don't you? Don't, okay? Don't put words in my mouth, Lori. What about Del Gado? I mean, doesn't it make sense that this guy is knocking off all these chatroom people? Could have been, except that someone in the chatroom was murdered after Del Gado was arrested. Washington, what about Del Gado? What did he say when you locked him up? Nothing. As a lawyer, - what do you expect? Washington. Check. Lindsay Jeffries-- she was just attacked. Flesh wound to the chest. Linds, the FBI is here. I'm glad I picked up your pain meds. You're gonna need it. - I'll leave you two guys alone. - Thanks. Hi, Lindsay. I'm sorry about what happened. Del Gado's been apprehended. All this was done by Robert? By my lawyer? It may be more complicated than that. - Excuse me. Holy shit. It's coming from Sandra Wilson's BlackBerry. Lindsay, do you remember at all what your attacker looked like? No, he was wearing a mask. - Anything-- anything you can think of. - No, I already told you people - that I can't remember. - Think, Lindsay! No! Okay. I am sorry. Let me help you with that. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I am a little bit nervous. Oh, there there. My love, I have no doubt that you are going to get exactly what you deserve. You know something, Carol? - What? - You are the best wife that a man could ever want. Oh. - You are. This man has not only given years of dedication to his profession as professor of liberal arts, but he has been the living embodiment of integrity for which this university was founded upon some 1 20 years ago. It is an honor to present you with the next Dean of Students--- Professor... Gerald Woodward. Gerry, you should've seen the look on your face. I mean-- right, Right. Okay. - Champagne? - Bob, can I talk to you for a minute? Why certainly, Michael. Just give us a minute, okay? Where is that lovely wife of yours? I think she's in the ladies' room. - I'm kind of fond of her. - Thank you. Bob, when we last spoke, you distinctly told me that I was a shoe-in for the dean position. - Yes. Yes, I did. - Well? You heard me speak tonight about honor-- honor and integrity. Sir, I have always embodied those qualities every bit as much as Gerald Woodward. Then perhaps you might want to explain... these to me. I don't understand. Look, I don't think that blackmail, especially of such a salacious sort is the kind of methodology we're looking for in professors, much less deans, but it does explain the sudden surge in support for your candidacy, doesn't it? Bob, I'm as stunned as you are. I would never be a party to anything like this. Now whatever shenanigans Miss Mulroney's been involved in-- Oh, save it, Michael. Get down on your hands and knees and be grateful that you still have a job. And I wouldn't take much comfort in that if I were you. As for you, young lady, your presence on this campus is no longer required. Bob, this is ridiculous. I'm innocent! You were going to sell me out just like that. - Oh shut up. - Carol? - That's right, Michael. See, a woman always knows. Some might choose to accept it and some others might choose to have a little fun, like me, but a woman knows, Michael. I want your stuff out of my house by the end of the week. But that's not fair. Where will I live? And as for you, sweetie honey, with skills like these, you will never be out of a job. Are you gonna let her talk to me like that? I said shut up. Carol? Carol? Carol! Mailbox 1. I've got a gun. I'm gonna end this now. Hello? Hey. - What's going on? Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Easy. Put the gun down. Put it down. Come on. Look at me. Look at me. What's going on? Put it down. Come on. Come on. Talk to me. I can help you. Let me help you. Let me help you. Put it down. Let's talk. Let me help you. All right? I want to help you, but you've got to put the gun down. I love you. That's it. That's it. Thattsagirl. Thattsagirl. - Ah! Are you all right? Help yourself to something, all right? Thank you, man. You take a load off. Can I get you a beer or something? No, I'm fine, sweetie. I need to rest, you know? That what I need-- I just need a little bit of alone time, you know? Please, Joey. I'm okay. I'm okay. It was her or you. Do you hear me? Her or you. Okay. Hey, you. Don't worry about your brother. He's gonna be all right. Will he? Trust me. Come on. - How are you doing? delete - FBI! Ma'am? - Oh God. Oh, sorry. Oh. It's okay. I'm all right. I just tripped. You must be here about the shooting. What, are you a friend of the landlord? Oh, no no. I am the landlord. I've got a gun. Just put the gun down. Put it down. I'm gonna end this now. - Ah! I'm Jackie-- Jackie Danielson. We thought Christine Jensen was the landlord. She's just a dear friend of my husband's family. She stays here from time to time when we go away on vacation. We came back early, actually, because we heard about everything that was going on here. Chrissie was really distraught. Joe said that when he returned to Sandra Wilson's apartment after calling the police he found Christine standing over the body. Oh, no. It's only been a year since her brother killed himself. That must've really opened up old wounds for Chrissie, standing over Sandra's dead body like that. I mean, she was really really upset when her brother died. I'm scared. I'm scared. I could be next. This person seems to know my every move. I don't know. Maybe it's a good thing that she's starting a new job on Monday. She was always the happiest when she was sitting in front of her own computer keyboard. She got a job working on a computer? But she was just learning how to use them. I don't know where you got that idea. Chrissie was a wiz with those things. - Lori: Can we speak with her? - She's gone. Left last night with all her stuff. I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye to her myself. That's strange. She did leave something. Her favorite slippers. Silly little things. She had a funny name for them. What was it? Oh, right. Yes, her velvet 50'cent shoes. I'm gonna end this now. How did you like my little gift? I just bet you wish it had a bullet in it for me. - Don't you?! - Ow! Ah! You think you might have learned something... after what happened to William. - You son of a bitch! - Honey! I didn't know your brother was married. - Liar! - I swear! No, please. I am nothing without my family. You should've thought of that before you brought this tramp into our lives! - Tramp? You have no idea... - No. No no, please. - ...what I've been doing! - Wait wait wait wait. - What are you doing with that? - Don't. Don't. No wait! - No! - What are you doing? - No! No no, wait! No! No! You and the rest of the FaceSpace degenerates took him from me. Only that thoughtful lawyer Del Gado could understand. He had his own punishments and gains for you chatroom whores! Robert Del Gado? Who killed Joe's brother? And rightfully so! He has to rot in jail. Well... you'll have no such luck. - Keep typing. - Keep typing... ...so everyone hears your confession. The FaceSpace murderer. Hello? Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Put the gun down. Put it down. You don't want to do this. You don't want to shoot me. Let me help you. Let me help you. Put it down. That's it. - Ah! Oh, fuck. Why? Did you miss me? I did. I did. I missed you. Well, good. It's nice to be missed.
