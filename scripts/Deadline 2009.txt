He has no idea where you're going. What if he finds out? Alice, I don't like you having a gun. You don't even have a license for it. I don't understand. Why can't you just stay here and work while I'm in New York. I don't want to be alone in the apartment. I don't feel safe here. Besides, I'm already behind on my deadline. You're putting yourself under too much pressure. It's too soon. If I don't go to work I will go crazy. You look really great on film. You're a real voyeur ain'tcha? Filmmaker. Oh, like there's a difference? There's other things to film. You're ruining my shots. So how much are you paying for this place anyway? Free. Free? Uh-huh. This is the slimy producer who's been trying to get in your pants for the last year, correct? He's not slimy. He's rich. And he's helping out a struggling writer. Yeah. Right. You know what I was thinking? Maybe you should write about your own life? It might be therapeutic. I have no interest in writing a horror film. Oh my God we've found it. You think it's big enough for me? It's big enough for a football team. Oh my Goodness. You are gonna be so lonely here. That's exactly what I want. It's perfect. Well alright then! It's huge. Oh my Goodness. Ohhhh. Come on, let's go upstairs. Oh. Bedroom? Yes. Look at that balcony. I could definitely get used to this. Okay. Old houses are like people. They grumble and moan and cry like they're in pain. And keep you awake at night. I'm gonna miss you. Are you? Yes. Even your sarcasm. Ben was stupid to do what he did to you. I hate it when you're sad, Alice. It makes me sad too. Come on. Come on, let's check out the rest of the house before you have to leave. Alice? Where are ya? Hey. How odd. I wonder who owned this place before the producer guy bought it. I have no idea. A family, I guess. Alice. Don't... Don't torture yourself. Come on. Come. Come on. Let's go. Are you sure you want me to take the car? Yes. You'll be stranded here without it. That's the whole point, so I can focus and work. Why don't you just let me take a cab to the airport, it's not a big deal. Becky, I don't want the car. I'm never gonna use it. Okay. If you're sure. This is everything. Where's my laptop? Up stairs in the bedroom with your suitcase. Is this enough food for one week? Plenty. I don't eat much when I'm working. I'll unpack the rest. Come on, let's go before you miss your flight. You'd better call me. Oh, of course I will. Don't forget to brush your teeth. Thanks, Mom. Don't forget to drive carefully. Hello. Hello? Becca? Hi. Ally. I have something to tell you. Promise me you won't freak out. Ben turned up at the apartment looking for you. He's out of prison. Since when? Last night. Last night? And you didn't call me to warn me? Calm down, please. He has no idea were you are. No, I'm not calming down. Ben knows he's going to go back to prison if he comes within a mile of you. Rebecca, Ben doesn't care about the law and you know that! Shit! Need a hand Scooch? I got it. Play with your toy. Hey, show me the ring. Haven't you seen it enough already? Well Mrs. Woods, I would like to see how the lens does on closeups. Tsk. Wish I could've afforded the other one. David. Don't say that. Alright? I adore this ring. And I adore you. So what time is your mom coming? Seven. Is she planning on spending the night again? It's her house. She just gets lonely by herself. Alright. I'll talk to her. Thank you. You're welcome. Well dinner's almost done I think you could put that thing away. David! Alright! You look so cute in your sexy glasses. Come on turn it off. Don't tell me you weren't a runway model one day. Flattery will get you nowhere. Okay. Why don't you pretend you're somebody famous then. No, Ally, I'm reading! Give me the damn camera! No, I don't think so. Oh oh oh, she thinks she's stronger than me! I can't leave the film like that! It's still rolling! So how long are you going to keep me a secret? You're not a secret. Nobody knows about me. I haven't met any of your friends. Are you ashamed of me? Oh, that's not true. Then what are you afraid of? I'm afraid that if Ben finds out how close we are he's gonna get the wrong idea. Wrong idea about what? It doesn't matter. Ally, nothing is going to happen to you. I had this dream once where he killed me. It's just a dream. He's getting out soon. Come on, come on, come on. Hello? Oh, it's me. Alice, it's 4:00 o'clock in the morning. I though someone had died. I just. I needed to hear your voice. Is something wrong? I'm not sure. What does that mean? I I don't know, I think, uh, I think there's someone in the house. Have you called the police? No, it's not like that. Call the damn police or I will. It's not normal. Tell me what's going on. You're not making any sense. I think someone died here. Call the damn police or I will. I can feel it. I can feel the sadness, the energy. Did you hear what I just said? Yes. Well? I think you watch too many movies. This house is creepy. It's an old house, Ally. Of course it's creepy. Someone used my laptop. And I keep hearing these voices. Someone crying like they're in so much pain. Ally? Yes? Have you been taking your medication? You don't believe me. It's 4:00 o'clock in the morning and you're talking about a ghost. I shouldn't have called you. No. Don't say that, please. I'm glad you called. Look, why don't you get a taxi back to the city, you'll be here in a few hours. I'm not leaving. I came here to work. You are putting yourself under too much pressure. You'll make yourself sick again. Alice? Alice? Are you there? Hello? Yes. Alright. I'll take my pills. Sorry I called you. Inspire me, Lucy. My muse. You are so beautiful. Thank you. Can you please stop filming? You know, it kinda makes me nervous What time do you think you'll be home? Not too late. What's your friend's name again? Marie. She single? No. She's a, she's married to Luke, remember? Luke was at the wedding. Oh, yeah, yeah. Was Marie at the wedding? She's one of my best friends. I haven't really seen her that much since I've been with you, you know. She is gonna freak when I tell her that I'm pregnant. Ever since we were little we were always saying we'd get pregnant together. You didn't tell her? I've been saving it. I wanna see her face when I say ' I'm pregnant! ' you know? I want the surprise. You know, how do I even know you're seeing this girl. Huh? You could be... going to see some guy David? We're having a baby together? How could you say that? I guess I'm scared. Scared of what? Scared that you'll meet someone else. Scared that I'll lose you. But I belong to you. Remember? You're just so young and beautiful. What man wouldn't want to be with you? Hey! You came to help. Oh, my god... Oh, honey. Oh this place looks. Our son is going to be so proud of his beautiful and talented mother. Or maybe our daughter. Then I'll have two amazing women in my life. David. Can you stop playing for a minute and please help? I'm documenting. All of it. Everything we're doing. For our kid. You're documenting? Yeah, it's important. Oh! What? That is completely unnecessary. Ugh it's documentable. Yeah, get it. Oh, okay, I will. Ughhhh, you killed me! Nooo! That's ridiculous! Here here here. Wait wait wait. There, I'm helping. No, yes, very helpful. I'm crazy about you, you know that? You're my world. David. What brought this on? I'm just being nice to my wife because she deserves it. Well, thank you, but I'm working. You're distracting me. Yeah? You don't want to be distracted right now? No, not right now. Why not? Hm. David, come on. I'm serious. Your smell Schoochy. David. David! What? Honey? Just. You know. Jesus. I just want to be close to you, honey, don't. What? Baby don't walk away, I'm sorry. What happened to you, Lucy? I'd like to see you. Maybe I'll go back to school in a few years. Psychology? You're right. I never thought about it that way but it's true. I'm going to, uh, call you back. Who you talking to? Who were you talking to? Did you hear what I said? Huh? Who were you talking to? This is getting ridiculous. I, I can't handle this any more. Well then just answer. Answer what? It's, I don't have to answer. It's a simple question. Yeah you do! Who were you talking to? Your mother! Alright? I- I was talking to your mother! What's happening to you? Every day you're like a different person. I'm going to bed. I would be more comfortable if you slept in the spare room. Hello? Lucy. Is that you? You look like an angel when you sleep. Hello? Who is this? Who is this? David. David! I told you to stop filming me! Where are you going? David. Uh, I'm just gonna take a couple of days, you know, take a break. You're you're smothering me! Come on, close the door. You're not leaving. Close the door. Just gimme the car keys. No. Just. No! I knew it. You are not leaving me for another man. What? Lucy, I've heard you on the phone with him! Talking. Laughing. Flirting. You, you think I'm stupid! David. Maybe, maybe, you know, we could talk to someone. We could get some help. Oh, really. Oh, come on. No! Help me. Tell me what to do. I'll do anything. He thinks it's someone else's baby. It's cold. Where's David? What happened to him, Lucy? Lucy? Show me. Hey, I haven't heard from you in days. Something bad happened here. Look, maybe you're going through some kind of delayed shock here, you never really dealt with what Ben did to you. What are you talking about? A few months ago Ben broke into the apartment he went crazy, saying the baby belonged to someone else. I don't remember that. He tried to drown you in the bath, Alice. You miscarried the next day. You had a breakdown. You have to stop denying this. The missing tape. You know if I had the missing tape. If I could find the missing tape. What are you talking about? What missing tape? He was always filming. Always. There was an empty tape box. Then there's obviously another tape. Listen, I need you to do me a favor. If you could get on the Internet. Just find out, look up everything on the name David Woods. David Woods. Okay. Who is David Woods? Can you not ask questions! Just do it, please? I'm still at the hospital with my Mom. I'll have to do it later. This is important. Do you promise me you're going to do it? I said I would. Thank you. The woman in the mirror lies. Hello. Ally, I checked on line like you asked me to. What did you find out? David and Lucy Woods were reported missing May 5th 2006. I knew it. Who reported them missing? David's mother. A few days before he disappeared he told his mother that Lucy left him for another man and went back to Chicago. They were only married six months. She was pregnant, it says he had a history of depression and tried to kill himself the year before when Lucy tried to call off the engagement. Alice, do you really think he killed her? I don't know. What do you think happened to David? I'll call you back. David. David, come on. This this is hurting my arms. I know you slept with him. Admit it. Say it! David, you gotta stop and think. Think about this. Jesus. I swear to God. I swear to God baby. You just tell me the truth, from the beginning and this will be over. This is ridiculous. You called him because you were lonely. Because I neglected you. And, right? David? It was Luke, wasn't it? Do you...? Luke? Just say it. Marie was out of town, and Luke was lonely too, so you called him up and Oh, my God. You seduced him. Oh my God. David, we're having a baby! That thing's not my child. Oh, no. Say it. Just tell me the truth, Lucy. It's all I want, it's just... He, he, he, I'll still love you. Gosh! I, uh... Tsk. I seduced him. Come on, David. Come on. Say it. We made love and. I only saw you, though. Oh, oh. Oh, shit. David! David! David! David. David! David. No. No! Phew. Ugh. Oh, Lucy. Hello? Who's this? It's Ben. Don't hang up, please. What do you want? Forgiveness. For what? While I was in prison I thought about you a lot. What I put you through. The things I said to you. The baby. You're in the house. You've been in the house all along. It's been you, watching me. No, I'm in Boston with my mother. You're a liar. Please let me talk. Look. I just need to tell you that I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I know, I know the baby was mine. And I know that, I know that I killed it! I'm sorry. I promise that I'll never hurt you again. I'm going to let you go Alice. You're free. Lucy. Lucy. We're free now. David! David. What are you doing? You damn idiot! You damn fool! David. Are you all right? Lucy. Lucy? Alice? Where have you been? The gun. Where did you put the gun? What? He's in the house. He's going to kill me! What? David. Who is David? Becky, we talked about this. I told you about this. Alice, I haven't heard from you all week. I've been worried sick about you. Are you still there? Why? Why did you take the gun? Why? I couldn't leave you with a gun. No one's going to hurt you, Alice. No! No! No! David. Ah! Ah! Alice! Oh, my God. Alice? Ugh. Alice, what happened? Come on, I've got you. Oh. Let me help you. Let me help you. No! No! I don't want to go in that bed! Let me give you some pills baby. They're gonna help you sleep. Drink. Drink. I'm sorry, baby. Da... uh, uh, Da- Da- Da- David's mother knew that he killed Lucy. So she told the police that they both went missing to protect them. And when she died he moved back into the house and he's been here ever since. No, he... He was here. He was in the house. He's been watching me. He's been watching me. Shhhh. You have to rest. Just listen to what I'm saying. Please, I think someone died here. Just tell me the truth. David! We're having a baby! David. Ugh. I am so sorry I left you alone. I promise you I will never leave you alone again ever. Okay? You look like an angel when you sleep.
