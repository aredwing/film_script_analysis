No, why? I go home this way a lot, by this tree. - It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, really beautiful. Believe it or not... ...I talk to this tree, and it talks back! I sit beside it for hours and write. We wrote 'The Rhino' together. It was my inspiration. You don'! believe me? Not really. Come, I want to show you my secret library. What do you want from the soil? Haven't they set you free? They opened the ground, and covered your signs They have announced you dead Whether you're dead or alive No one knows Sew your lips Carry the walls on your shoulders And leave May your mother rest in peace.

No other organization can do what we do ...as fast as we do it. Something important happened. Yesterday, we found your wife's address. This is good news. But there is a problem. Your wife has a file here. In theory, no Iranians should have a file here... ...unless someone is looking for them and came to us. In this case, someone opened a file on her. Six years ago, someone was looking for your wife. - Who? - Akbar Rezai. - Who? - Akbar Rezai. Do you know him? No. It doesn't matter. You were in prison for 30 years. Maybe she got remarried.

My guys found out about him. Before settling here for good... ...he used to come and go for years. He visits your wife a lot. Your wife's children say that he's not their father. They insist to the neighbours that their father died. So they are yours! Are they you!-5? - Are you sure? - Yes. Really sure? The last time you saw your wife was in prison, think about it carefully. - Here. - Thanks. You want to play'? What? Your apparition fades away It falls on the water You look at it The moment halls It also looks A spider arrives It mixes the moment with its sticky saliva It weaves a web from time You are hunted... it leaves you A spider the size of a Of a spider The sky darkens, clears, darkens The tree gasps for air to dry its sap.
