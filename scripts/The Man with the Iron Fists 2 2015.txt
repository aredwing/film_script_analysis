Lord Pi, a renegade monk, learned whoever controlled the Golden Nectar could gain immortality. So he pursued the prize with a savage onslaught. The monks, who had protected the source of chi for centuries, were not strong enough. But the Abbott, a man of peace, was prepared for war. The Gemini Killers. They delivered both the element of surprise and the extreme force needed to vanquish this dark enemy. Lord Pi had finally overplayed his cosmic hand. That was 10 years ago. Now, legend has it that the ghost of Lord Pi still haunts these remote mountains, stealing chi from any source he could find. They say Lord Buddha laughs at the world, and I'm sure he's laughing down at me. After leaving Jungle Village, I decided to return back to the monks. My challenge would be to find peace, reawaken my chi and atone for my sins. Maybe this Golden Nectar at the Wuyi mountain could help build me a new future. Lord knows I need it. But even though you may try to leave your past behind, in the end, it always finds you. Whoever you are, I don't have no quarrel with you. Oh, but you do. You murdered my brother, Silver Lion. I should have recognized the stupid hairstyle. Kill him. Look. Look what he has done to my daughter. What has this evil spirit done to my angel? How many more will the ghost of Lord Pi take before we stop him? You... You are the mayor of this town! It's your responsibility to protect our children! Master Ho! You didn't protect her either. Such a pretty little thing. What a waste. Your grieving time's over. Get back to my mine before my silver turns to dust. Okay, everybody. Let's carry on. If we want Master Ho's full cooperation in catching this perverted demon, we must show him our dedication. I hear you all think the tools I provide are inadequate. You bastard maggots of whoring mongrel dogs. Do you think this is fit for the job? Do you think this is a good tool? Well, let's see! No! Who here thinks this is not a good tool? A bad craftsman blames his tools. All of you miners are under contract to me! When you are in this mine, you belong to me. If you're not convinced, I'll have the heads of the five slowest miners today. Hey! Back to work! Back to work, now! Stay back. What are you all standing here for, huh? Get back to work! All of you! Back to work. Will you trust me? This is not the time. You. Outside with me. Now! Go! The Beetle Clan are killing our men! We must stand up for ourselves. We may not have the right weapons, but we are ready. I ask you, Li Kung, when do we take the fight to these bastards? We must remain composed and only make our move when everything is in place. Patience is the key to victory. You've been preaching patience for many months now. Where has that gotten us? Are you questioning my leadership? Come on, let's go. It's getting late. So, who among you has a complaint tonight? Step forward and challenge your opponent. From the shadows you attack me? Master Ho will challenge any of you to step in the ring and fight me with honor. I'll take all of you on. Who among you wants to take on Master Ho? Fools. Show me your face. I came here for you, Master Ho. Let me tell you how this will end. I've been hanged once. I've been bullwhipped twice. I've been shot at eight times. I've been dragged behind horses 15 times. An overzealous whore in Manchukuo chewed off my left testicle before I cut off her head and had my way with her. It takes more than bad intent to kill me. The stars must align. The birds must swim. The fish must fly, before I will die. You see, gentlemen, you just walked into a windstorm of flying elephant shit. Attack! No! Stop it! No! You feeling brave today, Kung? You keep your gaze on your boots or you'll end up like my friend here. Keep on walking. Someday, I'll shove my shovel down his gullet. You keep your nose on the grindstone, brother. He's itching for a fight today. A girl is dead! They found another girl near the village! A girl is dead! What's going on in here? Get back to work! Unless you want to join your dead friend! The ghost of Lord Pi has killed another girl. Why can't you stop him? I'll kick your teeth in if I hadn't done it already! A girl is dead and you threaten us? You dare talking back to me, my monkeys? Li Guang! Li Guang! Never, ever lay hands on me again. Get back to work. All of you. Duyan will resolve this issue with you later. You know how. You all know the rules and the law. I hate this hole. Almost as much as you. Work! I don't need you defending me. Next time, just mind your own business. Li Guang, you are my younger brother. But your temper often gets the best of you. While you stood there and did nothing for us! Master Ho, I need to talk to you about the murdered girls. Can you do nothing? If you have a grievance, take it up with the mayor. Master Ho, you must protect this village! Kung! Look who saved your day. Get this pathetic, ignorant insect out of my sight. Come. Come. We will all come together. The villagers want justice. Not just for the murdered girls, but they're killing miners as well. Two more yesterday. I will appeal to Master Ho. Words are not enough, Mayor. Yes, I understand. I'll take care of it, trust me. Kung, rumor has it that your brother is going to challenge Duyan at the fight court tonight. I'm concerned for his safety. Li Guang can take care of himself. Duyan is not a small man. If he crushes him, and I suspect he will, what will be the miner response? These are the Honor Fights, Mayor. So whatever the outcome, our people will accept it. If you get Li Guang to apologize, to sacrifice a week's wages... My brother is a very, very proud man. He would never apologize. So be it. I understand your fear. But Mayor Zhang has promised me that Master Ho and his Beetle Clan is doing everything they can to find the murderer. But what if it is the ghost of Lord Pi? How will they protect us? How will you protect us? Enough with this superstitious nonsense. Well, maybe it is Ho himself? Ever think of that? We all know of his insatiable lust for the young flesh. Innocence. I will get to the bottom of this, I promise you. Right. Where are you going? To the tavern. You're going to the duel. Everyone is talking about it. Please don't have him fight. He has made up his mind, Ah Ni. It will kill him if he doesn't fight. Well, at least someone in this family is willing to take a stand. Innocence! I will be back before midnight. Evil spirits, go away. My name is Li Guang. I represent my venerable home village of Tsai Fu. Today, one of your guards displayed unwarranted cruelty toward my fellow worker and must be taught humility. Yes. But your actions insulted the entire Beetle Clan! Therefore, you must face Shou. Fighters, prepare to battle. Come on, Li Guang! Come on, Li Guang! Get in there! Come on, now. Come on. Yeah! Come on, Li Guang! Come on! Watch out. Come on, Li Guang! That's right! You did it! Cheers. Cheers. Yeah. Yeah. It was a thing of beauty. I can't remember the last time that a miner saw such a victory! It won't be the last! It's time we stood up to these bullies! Stand up! Yes! Yes! Yeah. Right, Kung? You got it, two more. All right, everyone. Enough for one night. Time to go home to your wives. Kung. Leave it to you, Li Kung, to spoil all the fun. Let's go. We got work in the morning. Same old Kung. That's... What else could? Next time. All right, take a drink. Let's get out of this place. Congratulations, brother. You deserved to win. But watch your back. They're gonna be looking for payback. We can take on these thugs. You and me. Li Guang. You can't forget your past forever, Kung. You're drunk. Go home. Sleep it off. Li Guang. Li Guang. Are you okay? Hang on, okay? Wait! Wait! I'll get someone. Come help me. Come on. Good morning, Bing. Ah, beetles. Hey. My favorite. Your favorite? It was my favorite when I was young, too. Really? Yes. Long time ago. But you must remember something more important. What? Chi. Chi is an energy that encompasses us all. And can I ever see it? Well, no, but that's what makes the power of believing so strong. What's going on? What is it? Come here. Look what we found in the river. No, no, no. The answer is no. He could be a criminal, he could be a killer, or worse. He has to go. But, Father, he's in no condition. If we move him, he could die. Well, you should have thought about it before you brought him into my home. But, Father, look. Could it be him? Maybe. But with those battle wounds, he is likely in trouble. And more trouble, I don't need. What, you're taking her side, too? I haven't spoken a word. Well, you don't have to. Pity the man who lives in a house full of women. All right. But first sign of trouble, he's gone. You understand? Come up. The entire Beetle Clan was humiliated by your pathetic performance last night. You will need to learn how to get these cockroaches on their knees. Ah. Daddy Ho's home. Come, let me smell your rosebud and pluck your petal. Anyone see Li Guang today? No. But we could sure use his strong back right now. Kung! What is that? What in hell's name? Come on. Let me see. Take a look. What do you see? It's a parallel corridor. Beautiful. Kung! This vein is rich in silver! Look at this! Then we have to come back and explore it. For now, we keep all this to ourselves, all right? Let's get back and plug it up. Come on. We're coming back. Make some room. This is between us, got it? Like a secret! Okay. Plug it up before someone sees it. Yes, boss. No! No! There she is. You can't run from us, girl. Come out, come out, wherever you are. It's all right. You're safe here. Here. Easy. Where am I? Jiangxi province. Outskirts of Tsai Fu. Near the Wu Chi temple. Not many know of this place. Does anyone else know that I'm here? We took great care to preserve your privacy. Are you in some kind of trouble? Perhaps. We know who you are. Your legend precedes you, Blacksmith. They call you the "Man With the Iron Fists." Meet my only daughter, Innocence. My name is Li Kung. And that is my wife, Ah Ni. My name is Thaddeus. You fight for the side of good men? What I did in my past, and what I do in my future are two different things. I no longer have desire to fight. I'm on a quest for inner peace. Well, you came to the wrong town for that. I have to move you to a safer place. Master Ho, the man who owns the mines, rules this town. He is a ruthless man. And if he knows of your special gift, he might have other designs for you. Innocence is in charge of your care. Although she is young, but she is a gifted healer. She and her friend saved you from the river. I wanna thank you for saving my life. I've arranged for Cha Pow and Bolo to move Thaddeus to the old blacksmith shop. We'll take care of it, don't worry. So no one has seen my brother yet? Too much celebrating, I'm sure. And be careful. The walls have eyes and ears in this town. In the meantime, I will look for my brother. And you be careful. Who was he? The last blacksmith. I guess his customers wasn't satisfied. You can rest here for now. There's water and some food. Also, Li Kung said he'll stop by to visit you soon. In the meantime, he wanted you to take a look at these. The silver mines. It seems like everyone in the whole town works there. Anyone with an able body. The old men and the women, they help run the village, take care of the children. But those that try to run away, they end up hanging on the stakes at the edge of town. We may be from different countries, but we got a lot more in common than you think, Bolo. I like to chop the rocks. I know you do, Cha Pow. It makes me happy. Yeah. But it makes me sad when the girls die. What is he babbling about? There's been a few murders recently. Young women. Their bodies just shriveled up like dried fruits. They say it's evil spirits. But I know it's the ghost of Lord Pi. It's like they're voided of... Chi. Yes. Yes. Play with each other. Make each other wet. Giggle, laugh, enjoy. I have three rules I will tell you now. The first rule, if you bite me, I'll rip out your teeth. If you talk to me, I'll rip out your tongue. If you look at another man, I'll rip out your eyes. But aside from this, I'll give you the finest food and the finest wine, and we will have a fine time. Now, play with each other. Master Ho. Duyan. Everything has been taken care of. He won't be causing any more trouble. This is madness. No one has ever been down there before. Well, Master Ho ordered that we explore the cave floor below. He wants to leave no stone unturned. Boss, I got a bad feeling about this. What if a dragon's down there? I don't like dragons. Then I drown him like a rat. I don't like rats either. We're supposed to keep you safe. Let me go down instead. I wouldn't ask my men to do something I wouldn't do myself. Let's go. Let's. Li Guang. Li Guang. I'm sorry, Li Guang. Hey, you! Over there! Back to work! What's the problem, Kung? Was your brother not careful? I made a vow to always protect my family, including my brother. Having failed at this, I now have no choice but to honor his legacy and demand justice. Cease! For you, he's family. For me, he's another dead miner. And if any of you other miners decide to lose your way, there will be more accidents. Get used to it. He was a good man. A proud man. He won fair and square. And now he's dead. That's not right. It could have been an accident. No sign of foul play. Your words spill out like dung from a cow, Zhang. He was my brother! You tell your boss I'm not letting this one go. You're in no position to demand anything, Kung. We must keep our wits about us. We don't want to feel the full force of Ho's wrath... I have always been willing to stay in my place and do Ho's bidding, as long as it protected my family, but now? I know, I know. It doesn't seem right. But I have to warn you, Ho is not happy you've been stirring rebellion in the mines. Watch your back. So, Mr. Kung, tell me. These tools? What's the story? I hope you didn't find me presumptuous. But I wanted to get your professional opinion on these. Well, they're made of the cheapest pig iron I've ever seen. And if the goal is to get as much silver out of the mines as quickly as possible, you'll never reach your quota. So you understand my problem. Can you help us? I can fill your pockets with silver. That won't be necessary. I'm in your debt. After all, you did save my life. That was my daughter's doing. Me? I would have thrown you out. Well, so much for southern hospitality. We are desperate people, Thaddeus. I need to liberate us from the ruthless Beetle Clan. And when that fight comes, my people need a way to protect themselves. I know you forge the best weapons. Will you make them for us? Mr. Kung, with all due respect, I've made many devices that killed many men. Even my hands have become weapons. I'm on a path to Buddha. And making weapons is not on that path. Doesn't Lord Buddha protect the weak and punish evil? I'll fix your tools for you, then be on my way. How you use them is up to you. That's very kind of you. It's nothing. My bandages, did you wrap them? My father did the dressing. Your father seems like a good man. He's a very gentle and kind man. Sometimes I think too kind. I wish he was more like you. Brave. Strong. You shouldn't take kindness for a weakness. Sometimes it takes more courage not to fight than to fight. My best friend, Chow-Li, was murdered, and then my uncle. My father did nothing. I'm sure he has his reasons. Well, someone has to do something. We can't just wait for Master Ho to act. We, Beetle Clan, challenge Li Kung to a duel. I have no fight with any of you. So I humbly decline your challenge. Kung. You cowardly dog. You vile clown. Is it that easy for you to disrespect your village, your family, forget about your dead, rotting brother? You know, the guards tell me that your daughter is quite the budding rose. I, Li Kung, of Tsai Fu Village, accept your challenge... Yes! Yes! ...in honor of my brother, Li Guang. And don't ever, ever mention my daughter again. Kung! Be careful! We can take on these thugs. You and me. You can't forget your past forever, Kung. Yeah! He did it! We won! Yeah! Yeah! Cha Pow! Cha Pow, I need your muscles inside. Uh, I think I'm supposed to watch the door. Let him guard the door. The beauty of iron lies in its ability to adapt. It offers quick results and fast change. You've got a knack for this, Cha Pow. Metal is strong, like me. You are no ordinary miner. You are much more than that. Your abilities in the ring gave you away last night. You belong to the Praying Mantis Clan, don't you? Look, Kung, I don't like Ho any more than you do, but I answer to that monster directly. And you have a target on your back. Anything else? Go back to representing the miners. And let me work on Ho for concessions. But be forewarned, don't push Ho. Ho can make things difficult for you and me. And your family. You may answer to Ho, but I don't. Not to you, not to anyone. Not any longer. Kung. Kung. I am not the enemy, Kung. Kung! Boss. Boss. You must come to the duel tonight. Too much work to be done here, Cha Pow. What's so special about tonight anyway? Li Kung is going to challenge Master Ho. Foolish. Cha Pow. Yes, boss? A gift. For you. For all your hard work. Cha Pow! Cha Pow, Let's go! Li Kung is waiting. Come on. Thank you. What's this? Come here... Boss! You're bleeding! Let's try to bandage this up, when we... When we get there. You all know me as Li Kung. Master Ho, you have committed crimes against the people of Tsai Fu Village. You have overseen corruption. You have condoned abuse and murder. And tonight, your reign of terror will end. Come on! Take him down! We won't take anymore! I, Li Kung, of Tsai Fu Village, challenge you to a duel. I accept Kung's pathetic challenge. We fight. Come on, Li Kung! Yeah! Let the fight begin! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Yeah! Come on! Yeah! You don't bring a knife to a sword fight. One of your guards stabbed Li Kung on the way to the arena! You betrayed us again! You got something to say, Bolo? You step forward and take this lowly maggot's place. And you, old man! You still got some fight in you? I got this. What else you got? I got him. Arrest these traitors. Hang them in the morning so the whole village can witness their execution. Anyone else want to join them? You get to hang with a mine dog, blackie. I'm here like a frog on a string. Worthless. Never thought I'd miss all-American stock and chains. It's hard for me to accept that your arrival here is a mere coincidence, Thaddeus. I simply was trying to make it to the Wu Chi temple to redeem myself. They say at the temple, there's a spring, a well of some sort, with a concentrated level of chi. They call it the Golden Nectar. They say with this chi, a man can reach immortality. Me? I'm just trying to replenish my soul. Well, in the mines, they found a water source. Must be below the temple. Ho never wanted the silver. He wants the water! Mayor Zhang! Guess my arms still work. Zhang, you saved our lives. Up till now, you and I have been partners in the business of this town. But tonight, you became my friend. If only I could show an ounce of your bravery, Kung. But it's hard to be great man like you, with no legs. If only I could join your fight. Brother Kung's right. You saved our lives. And to liberate this town, it's gonna take all the help we can get. I can make you legs, Mayor. And you can join the fight. I am grateful for the sentiment, but... But how? I could forge you legs. The way I forged these arms. I never have dreamed of such a thing. With legs, I can stand with you all and rid this town of the Beetle Clan, once and for all. That's only half of our problem. That water source in the mines. We gotta get moving before they find out we escaped. Bolo, you get the miners ready for battle by the break of dawn. Cha Pow, you get whatever Thaddeus needs. Okay. I'll meet everyone back in front of the mines. Thaddeus. Brother Kung. This is not for the faint at heart. You will be in pain. I mean, a lot of pain. When I lost my legs, I lost everything, even my chance to have a family. Well, I promise you I'll help you walk again. I'm not touching anything else. Cha Pow, increase the fire. Legs. Thought I'd lost you. Father. You can't get rid of me that easy. It's time we stand up and take back our lives. Are you ready? I've been dreaming for this moment way too long. Chi is a universal life force, flowing through all matter, organic and inorganic, but when one is able to control this chi, he can use it to activate inanimate objects. Are you ready? Gag him. Okay, come on. You have my eternal gratitude, Blacksmith. Let's get you walking. You're standing! Easy. Easy, my friend. The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. What is your purpose here? I am Li Kung, a simple worker from Yin Silver Mine, near Tsai Fu Village. What business have you here? I believe your sacred water source is in danger, Abbott. It's the mine. What we thought was a mining operation for silver turned out to be a mining operation for your sacred water. Master Ho is an evil man, an indiscriminate killer. He's trying to steal the Golden Nectar out from under you. Who is he to walk along a path where even the mightiest have failed? Once, a truly powerful warrior tried to steal the Golden Nectar for his evil purposes. But he was defeated. Being of royal blood, we could not kill him. But we made sure he was never a threat again. So now we must join forces to protect the Golden Nectar. Leave me alone! Good. My chi isn't enough. You must have patience, Mayor. These things take time. We don't have time. Let him go. He's right. We don't have time. Stop! Look at that! Look. Do you see that? What's that light? The Golden Nectar has reached the mountain! One hundred men, to the village. The rest of you, follow me to the falls. Ah! Here you are. I've been looking for you everywhere. And this should look familiar to you, slave boy. You worthless Beetles are about to get squashed. Take him! Kung! Mayor! What are you doing? That is not your mayor! That is Lord Pi. You traitor! Lord Pi! I spared your life, but I made sure you will never walk or fight again. My legs have returned. And I will conquer these lands once and for all. You have followed a misguided path, Pi. Because of your black friend and the Golden Nectar, the power of chi has fortified the way of the Scorpion within me. Not if I stop you first. Bring the girl! Father! Innocence! You touch her, I'll kill you! Not if I kill you first. You coward! Pi! I gave you the Golden Nectar and I gave you the girls. I'll take Kung. He's all yours! And you are mine. Innocence! Innocence. No! Thaddeus! Help! No! I'm here. It's all right. It's all right. Innocence! She's alive! Well, brother Kung, the winds of change are upon you now. Brother Thaddeus, if fate indeed is the master planner, then may it smile upon your journey. And may fate cause our path to cross again, brother Kung. So Cha Pow, he got a new job and a new set of teeth. The Abbott and the monks, they continue to protect the source of Golden Nectar with the help of the miners. Brother Kung, he became mayor of the village. He took control of the mining operations which brought great wealth and happiness to the long-suffering people of Tsai Fu. And me, my journey begins again. You know, the Chinese say, "Where there's iron, there's rust." Yet rust only arrives when the iron is not in use. I may not find peace in this strange land, but I will find usefulness. You know, it's funny how a man can be a deposed wretch in one land and a hero in another. I guess that's just the way of the Tao. So be it.
