Give me a sec. When you hold this med kit, that space transforms into the sickbay. Everything's there, so don't worry. Check if anything's missing. - Afterneon, sir. - Medic? Petty officer 2nd Class, Park Dong-hyuk. - Park Dong-hyuk, you say? - Yes, that's right. A golden parachute into a medic assignment? No, sir. No? Want me to believe that? Expect me to believe that?

Dismissed. You'll be penalized as per regulations. Don't bring personal affairs here. I understand, sir. Salute! "Navy Fleet 2 Operating Base, Pyeongtaek, South Korea." This is footage of the 1999 Yellow Sea skirmish. As you See, when they cross the NLL, play the warning recording and block their path. This is their submerged patrol boat, T-34 tank turret is installed on the front. We're all edgy during the World Cup period, but we mustn't engage first, no matter the circumstance. Understand? Yes, sir! Yes? We'll resort to blocking when they enter our waters, but such maneuvers expose us to a possible ambush. To minimize our vulnerability, we should fire warning shots, and immediately suppress their provocation. You're not wrong, but we cannot change the rules of engagement. But... Soldiers must strictly follow our orders. - Understand? - Yes, sir! What'll happen if there's a clash during the games? Who'll take the heat? That's why we must have a plan to fall on. Remember the jet that exploded during '88 Olympics? Come on! Then what, should we just change it? Should we? Sir. He's trying to do good since he's got a new vessel. I know, that's fine. But don't pull that shit at a delicate period. Salute! Are you nuts?! You can't just barge in and stir things up. Your promotion's at risk! Think about your father. Why're you bringing him up? It's because I respect him! Commander on deck! - Salute! - Salute! Commander is relieved. Good Iuck. Lower the flag! Lower the flag! Set sail! Men on deck, at ease. You've got a lot of catching up to do! If I.. - A ton! - So salty... That's the forward base. And... that's North Korea. Do you see? What? - The artillery barrage. - Huh? They installed so many. A single shot will sink us immediately. Don't be so tense, ease up! Like hell! Therefore, we must keep moving, so they can't aim. "Yellow Sea Patrol Forward Base." Yo, First Aid! Come here, come. Sir? - On the double, asshole. - Yes, sir. Here. Heard of blue crab noodles? It's our vessel's specialty. What did you do before? I was a dentistry major. What did you do? They make fake teeth. I see. CPR per minute. Sir? Pop quiz, asshole. 100/120 - Pump depth? - 5 to 6cm. Well, not bad. Sir, did you Iearn that? It's second nature for us sailors. Yo, First Aid. Meds don't save people, people save people. Got it? - I understand. - So poetic. Chief petty officer! Stop it, you assholes! Turn that off. People kill people. Your negligence could give away our position to their subs. CPO Han. CPO Han Sang-guk! Order 100 push-ups. 'Light' at one, 'discipline' at two. Begin.

Do you eat metal and shit? So many pills every day. Sorry, I'm weaker than I look. What's this? Payment for the pills. You got anything else? I got a sister. Sister? - Hot? - They say we look like twins. A real cutie. "Yellow Sea Patrol Forward Base." Are you on it? Do it properly! Yes, I'm scanning! Dammit, step forward a bit. How's this? Go back a bit, bit more. Keep going. - Back? Here? - More, more. - Here? - Almost! We've got it! We've got visual! - Freeze right there! - Like this? Yeah, don't move an inch! Commander's coming, shut it off! Off! Yeah, from tomorrow... Goddamn First Aid! Yo, First Aid. Come here. - Sit. - Yes, sir. You've got impeccable timing. We thought you were the Commander. Reading your Ietters, dipshit? Is it nice to get Ietters? "My dear son, how are you?" Give it back. I'm reading this. Letgo. Got a problem with me? No, sir. Keep it and fuck off, mama's boy. Yes, sir. Don't you write your mother? What's wrong with writing a Ietter? Are you talking back? Hit the floor. No World Cup for you. Emergency! Deploy! Deploy! Deploy! Distance 2,000 yards.

You have crossed the NLL. Turn back now. I repeat, you have crossed the NLL. Turn back now. Fire the water cannon. Fuck off, motherfuckers! Take the fishermen into custody. Why are you here? Do all South Koreans treat lost fishermen Iike this? We're fishermen. Look here. Get that out of my face. Why are you here? I told you already. We got lost in the open sea. It's the Fleet Commander... Blindfold him. Lt. Cdr. Yoon. They could be intruders, but there's a no-clash order, so release them. Affirmative. Let them go. It's obvious they're not fishermen. We can't Iet them go. Did you not hear the Order? Give the order. Attention, release them, and back to your position. The hull doesn't look very sturdy. But their cannon accuracy may be better than ours. When in close range, we have the advantage. Pyongyang, North Korea. Ahn Jung-hwan's header, goal! Korea advances to quarter-final! Republic of Korea! "Yellow Sea Patrol Forward Base." How're the boys? Anyone hurt? CPO Park got hit with a rock, but nothing major. Right. Why do you think they were here? Who knows, that's never happened before. Maybe to haze you. Do you know what your boys call you? Go on. "The Poisoner." - Says who? - Everyone. So stopping poisoning them and be nice for once. With a warm heart, okay? Emergency! Battle stations! What is it now? This is the bridge, enemy spotted, distance 10,000 yards, 300. Combat Situation, battle stations.

The baby's not doing well, you come home once a fortnight. What am I to you? Just a girl you live with? Honey. The baby's important, but I only need you. You and me. Then stop sailing. You said you'd apply for a Iand assignment. Yeah. But the thing is... Marry the boat then. He needs to be admitted and get some tests. Didn't he report any pain? It's not your fault. Let's go. "SAILOR PROFILE: Han Sang-guk." "Boarded deep sea vessel after high scheel." "Father deceased, when he was 5." "SAILOR PROFILE: Park Dong-hyuk." "MOTHER: Disability Class. 1." Lt. Commander?

You mean, am I chasing a quick promotion by being here? Sir, I'm not someone who minces words. Promotion is important to me, and that's why I'm here. Since you're new here, I'm asking how you are. All right. Pour me a drink. Sir, Iet me pour you one. No. CPO Han? Aren't you right-handed? We perform dangerous maneuvers every day. My eyes and your hands must move in unison. Am I right? 27 men. Their Iives depend on your hand. If you can't protect them, walking away is an option. Isn't Lt. Cdr. Only a year older? If he were in the workforce, he'd be a newbie, but he's forced to Iead here. His father was an elite sailor. He even received a medal for sinking a spy vessel. A spy was captured, and he confessed his route, and all his supporters were arrested. The brass ordered an execution, but he couldn't pull the trigger. For that reason he was stripped of his rank. I don't know why he didn't kill the spy. When I saw his clear eyes... I Couldn't kill him. This'll look good on you, too. Yes? Salute! The Fleet Commander asked for CPO Han. Why? Probabw because of his hand. Salute! Salute! - Reporting for duty! - Report. Private Lee Jae-dong... - Newbie? - Fresh meat. Yo, First Aid. What'll happen to you now? He's transferring out, your golden parachute. You knew about his hand, didn't you? You wanted to sleep through the Service? We coulda died, because of you two! Piss off! I heard he covered for you over the years. What did you say? Are you fucking nuts? What's going on?! Salute! Get ready for Iights out. Personal and communal hygiene inspection in effect. If you don't pass, nobody sleeps. - Begin. - Begin! CPO, so your hand almost caused an accident? All right, fine. Here we go. Here, hold this. Go on. I'm not the one who's a weak Iink. Bullshit. You requested his transfer to a Iand position. Is this camaraderie? Okay, I'm fine with you covering for him. But I won't be responsible for what happens next. Go on ahead. Dismissed, both of you. Salute. Salute. Thinking about mom? It's all for the best sir. Indeed. Even if you don't sail, you're still Navy. We're Navy for Iife. Yo, First Aid! You look like a real Naval officer. You should become a CO. Not at all. I think you're fit for it.

I got all dolled up for nothing. You damn skirt chaser. Here. Go visit your folks, it's your mom's birthday. Don't wanna go? Wanna follow her? Of course not. Buy a present on the way. I'm off.
