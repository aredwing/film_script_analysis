This is a story of love... that we share, Noeru and me. Did you draw them with pencil? It's not about merit. Did you draw a lot when you were a child? I guess I did. What is the magazine you said youre working for? It's called "Splash". Nowadays illustrations of the famous are the latest rage. My drawing are different from yours. For me, the fun part is to work as a model. I have to say... yours are... the best I've seen till now. Tell me about this drawing The Boy and the Sea. Do you think to write about it? I don't like to explain my creations. You are surely right. But that wont sell magazines. Surely you are different. As you will understand, Thats not my problem. OK. So will you satisfy my curiosity? Your curiosity? This painting is... is the one I like most. It reflects a part of my life. I see. This is the one I like best. You are the first saying this. All the others make stupid questions. Like: "whats your favorite dish?" "whats your favorite color?" Your name was...? I don't remember right now. You have my business card. Mr. Mamiya. How is your first name read? Taishin. Taishin Mamiya. Welcome. For two? Is this allowed? Journalists don't make that much. This is my first important job. Therefore it's different from the others. I am more of an editor than a journalist. Let me treat you to dinner. Order whatever you want. You seem like a business man. Relax, its submitted as expenses. Order what you want. Really? Waiter! This, this and this. Without Green pepper. Some of these. And a bottle of... - Dom Perignon, please. - Sure, sir. No, the champagne was a joke, right? - Waiter! - It's on me. It's a present. Because I'm your first important job. How much is a bottle? I don't know. For sure it's expensive. Give it to me. Thank you. It's already open. Now we have to drink it. But it's on me. Mr. Mamiya, Youre a one-of-a-kind man. I guess youre even more special. You cant drink. You are a minor. Yeah, right. Kids should drink juice. So, you'll have to drink it alone. Of course. It's too expensive to pour it away. Cheers. To what will we drink? To your first big job. Did you rent your studio? My agency did. I see. Usually you sleep there? Sometimes. Often I stay in hotels... or at friends. I put up with anything. You have a very liberal life. Do you miss classes frequently? What's that now? Don't preach. I don't preach! But you are still a student. At least finish school. By the way... about that drawing... What drawing? The one of the Boy and the Sea. It's not for sale. Don't get me wrong. I was wondering if it was Cape Misaki. I am from Misaki. Thats why I ask. Have you been there before? It's not your business! Don't ask about that drawing! OK. Ill avoid questions about your private life. Are you seeing someone? Well, no. Why not? Youre very attractive. Why are you laughing? This was the last I expected to hear. Really. You must be very successful. The truth is, Im not. Im not like you... Im not in fashion. Im just an ordinary guy. Youre a professional model. I go to the rest-room. Mr. Mamiya. No, nothing. What? You needed to go, too? What's going on? What's that? Don't! Stop! Please... Enough! Don't be afraid. Hey, Mamiya! Mamiya! What about the interview? What? The article about Noeru Kisaragi. Im ... working on it. Youre a fool, you know? But youre still young. In each interview you present a different image. But your arrogance drives everybody mad. It suits you. But you seem to have no ambition. You are kind of a rowdy. Professor! What? Can I go to the sick-room? Are you sick? I don't feel well. Of course. Go. I knew you would be here. You miss too many classes. You won't make it into University. Youre skipping them, too. There won't be a problem, Im smart. Well, me too. You'll teach me. Deal? How about that interview about your work? Was it OK? Same as usual. You know how they are. Where are you going? I go for a piss. "Without the slightest doubt there is love in this world. What worries me is how to express it." Osamu Dazai MODEL AGENCY MACCHIATO DULCE Hello? Is this you, Noeru? What's up? Do you remember this interview for "Splash"? Sure! So? Some problem? This journalist... was very unpleasant. He was treating me and my work with arrogance... Thats no good. Ill contact them right away. You better. Just tell him to step by to apologize. For what? I just want him to apologize face to face. Are you sure? One moment, please. Mr. Mamiya, Its Mr. Ikari from Macchiato Dulce. Really? For me? Yes! Hello? Mamiya speaking. Yes, it's me. Could you be more specific? He really said that? Yes, sir. I am sorry. I understand. Yes, tonight. OK. Tonight. Yes. Mamiya. What did they want? Oh, it's nothing. Youre late. Don't stay there. Come in. You want a drink? You shouldn't drink. You are a kid. So, let it be. No. Don't be mean, Noeru. Now, out! I didn't see you here before. Get out I said. Alright. Call me whenever you want. Can't be. What's this about? I think it's quite obvious. I am not referring to that. Why did you lie to make me come here? Otherwise you wouldn't have come. Arent I right? What is it that you want? Why from me? I wanted to continue what we began. Leave me alone! In that case I'll leave! Wait! Are you sure? Are you telling me that you can't finish it? Yes, Ive completed 80%. All the details are there. I know it makes no sense. But I can't finish it. Youre not serious. Youre risking your job! Im a good writer, but this is too big for me. Listen, please. All the information is there. It just needs the final touch. Impossible! We have no time. This article was yours! I implore you! Well, you must have good reasons to be so persistent. Listen, Irie! Take care of Mamiya's article. Impossible! Im doing VIP gossip! So leave that shit. Thank you, sir! What was going on with Noeru? You are a fool, you know? Are you seeing someone? Look, don't do that! Don't be afraid. I wanted to continue what we began. It's a present. Because I'm your first important job. Cheers. Are you sure? How dare you! You know, you didn't write half of what I would have written. What? Really? Did you read it by chance? Yes. Come on... First, it was not even my article. You do your job, OK? I am sorry. You want me? Who are you? I... I just... Noeru isn't here. You came looking for sex, right? No, I write for a magazine. I came to talk to him. Yeah, sure... But youre just like all the others. Im sorry, right now, Noeru is having sex with somebody else. I can imagine. Are you his friend? That's none of your business. Now I remember. You were writing about his art. Did you write this article that came out recently? Yes I contributed. I read everything that is published about Noeru, but this article was the worst. Could you be more specific? You have absolutely no clue what his art is about. What are you talking about? "What caught my attention about the work of N. Kisaragi are his soft and exquisite mix of colors and lines. His work reflects substantially his love for his public. His satisfaction and feeling of being loved." Isn't it correct? You know nothing about Noeru. Nothing. Well, that's what it seems. Noeru's work does not reflect feelings. He himself admits that. This one is the only that shows his feelings. It forms a part of his life. Really? Did he tell you that? You seem a good guy. But you dont even have a clue. You know why he paints? No. For distraction. It's like doing it with a different guy every night. What do you mean? Hes not happy. Especially when it comes to sex. Hes always so sad. He doesn't just stop to draw these silly illustrations... and lay down with men for distraction. You like Noeru, right? Do I like him? No. I love Noeru. So why do you let him do it with others? Because I believe in him. I believe that in the end he will choose me. Is this you in this drawing? Unfortunately, no. This is Ken, his friend from childhood. I know Noeru inside out. Hes more fragile and weak than anyone. So, don't be too hard on him. "To love is to almost believe." Hugo Chidori told me you were here. I knew youd come. After three more lengths you can make love to me. I didn't come for that. I came to talk to you. I don't think Ill become one of your conquests. Ill never come to see you again. Neither will I work with you again. Chidori told me about you. He cares about you. Couldn't you quit going with others? You know you can't go on like that. You know it, right? For your own good, quit fucking around. I am done. Will you help me out? It's not about you, I do it for Chidori. Youre the worst. Don't get mad. What's the point? Alright, I will stop fooling around with others. But only if youre able to catch me. Im no swimmer! Don't be absurd! Let's go! You want to fuck me, right? You are crazy! You are so wrong! Asshole! You promised! You had the face...! I thought you were dead! This is how we grown-ups do it. That way you tricked me. Promise: You will quit lying down with anyone. Now... We'll go for the second phase... As long as people have friends to share their sadness... it becomes easier to bear." Shakespeare What's going on? What do you mean? Suddenly you decided to attend class? A lot of things happened. What does that mean? Come on, tell me. Nothing. Ah, before I forget... Here you have an article I wrote for you. Don't bother. I already delivered my own. I'm sorry for overloading you. I try hard to be a good student. Im in a very boring meeting. That's work! Cheer up! I wish I could be as lazy as you. To work, my friend! "Wherever there is one of us the other is present." Hemingway "In love there is only one law: to make your love happy." Stendhal One, two, three. One, two, three. Horrible! Listen! Show me how it has to be! OK? I can't do it like that! Look: one -- two -- three. Can you see? Now we do understand. There we go... I can't any more. You need to practice. I never learned to swim. But you are in good shape. Do you practice any sports? I used to box. Really? For how long? Not long What does that mean? You don't know? No, should I? Will you teach me boxing? But the first chance I get, I'll hit you below the belt. What was that good for? This is a report about the most important hospitals of Tokyo. I'll choose the most appropriate and we'll cover it right away. What is going on? Where are you going? Listen, Chidori. What is going on, Chidori? Youve changed a lot recently. You're the one who changed. And what is the problem? Let it go! What is going on, Chidori? This isn't you. Leave me alone. "Jealousy is Amor's sister... just as Lucifer is a brother of the Angels. Boufflers Chidori. What are you doing here at this time? - Hes here, right? - What? Hes in there, right? What are you talking about? Don't try to fool me. Listen. I want to know what's going on. Where did you hide him? What do you mean? It's all your fault. What are you talking about? About Noeru. Are you deaf? What? Whats with him? How dare you! What's going on between you and Noeru? Youre his new flame, right? Youre completely wrong. Noeru and me, we are more like... I know that you secretly went to bed with him. Let's get one thing straight: it's not what you think. So what kind of relationship is it? - It's... - You fell for Noeru. Thats what's going on. Ill never allow him to be yours. Its you! For a moment I was worried. I thought you were a ghost. If you have something to say, say it. We have a special relationship. What do we have thats special? We've been friends since we were little. You don't draw any more. I've been quite busy... How? It's gone! Where is it? You know how important it is to me, right?! He took it. Where did you take it? Let it go. You don't need it anymore. Neither do you need me. Don't be stupid! Hit me. Come on, punch me. Itll make you feel better. Come on! What will you do now? Tell me what youre thinking. You want that little reporter, right? What? Be honest. I want him. And what about Ken? Noeru, I love you. I loved you since Ken. You can't do anything without me. Were made for each other. You always come back to me. Im the best you can have. Together we can succeed in everything! You have only me! Wake up! I am the one who wants you most... in this world. You have to believe me. It's the truth. For me... you are a friend. It's good for you to draw. Youre talented. Neither more nor less. "Sometimes it's better to be wrong about your motives than to listen to the truth." La Rochefoucauld Are you ok? Are you hungry? Will you come to my place? Don't try to resist! Stop it now! Please, no. Youre hurting me! Don't you know who I am? Youre nothing. Who cares? Stop it! Not in the face! You know, I cancelled all your appointments. What the hell were you thinking?! Youre already punished. Take care. Taishin Mamiya. Noeru Kisaragi. Mamiya, is that article OK with you? Yes, sir. Career of Noeru Kisaragi stopped after brutal attack. You chose a very bad moment. We were having a great time. What do you have on your face? Now I have a lot of free time. Youre hopeless, you don't even know to keep a promise. That's true. You knew it right from the beginning, right? What do you want? Here youre useless. Get lost. Why are you doing this? Why didn't you keep our promise? Our promise? Promises are made to be broken. No. They are made to be kept. All our relationship depends on this promise. And now you spoiled it all. You are stupid. Only idiots believe in promises. I decided to never believe... in promises. What are you talking about? Ken didn't keep his promise. He promised that... he would be with me. He didn't keep his word. Ken? You mean the guy from your drawing? Who told you that? Chidori. When we met for the first time. In school they bullied us, Chidori and me. Ken was older, he defended us. He was very tender. Here. Thanks. You draw very well. Ken was strong and tender. He was great. I miss him. He always praised my drawings. I drew because I liked to make him smile. Take, it's yours. That you get better soon. You like whales, right? Youre good at drawing. Did you ever see the ocean? No, never. You? No. When I'm grown up, we'll go together. This is our promise. Really? Is it a promise? Yes, I promise. Soon, one week later... Ken died. He didn't keep his promise. This was the first time that I realized what I wanted. But... when you love somebody... Its so sad... And if, to want somebody... hurts me so much... I don't want to... feel love any more. I won't believe in promises any more. "When two people cry together for the first time they understand how much they love each other. Emile Deschamps Further edits into vernacular, American English: FootStudNY "The greatest joy Love can give you, is to take your lover's hand for the first time." Stendhal "Love is a sacred madness. Renaissance Proverb - Good morning. - Good morning. Mamiya, come with me. What's up? They've called from the Models' Agency to complain about you. You do know, why, no? Don't oblige me to say it. I believe in you. If you deny it, I will defend you. Tell me that it's not true. I will support you. I am sorry. I shouldn't bother you any more. This is my business. Are you serious? Yes. "The moment one begins to love another, is when life really starts." Scuderi It was you, right? What does this mean, Noeru? You told them everything. Hello!? I was informed that you lost your job. Come on, the news already spread? It was my fault. Don't be silly. It wasn't your fault. I decided to quit. Don't lie! It's true. Don't worry. The decision was mine. I guess you are at school, no? What will you do now? Life goes on. Ill find a new job. That's not what I mean... I mean us. It won't change anything. That's what I needed to hear. Were you concerned? How stupid. Don't lose more time. Go back to your class. Alright, I will. I did it. I have an exclusive about the actress that Arai is secretly dating. What do you think? Satoshi Arai? The celebrity? I called him and he confirmed. I think, he must be very in love. With his own words. - Are you sure? - Totally. Ask for declarations from their agencies. We won't accept "no comment." OK! It's the big news of the week. Awesome! What do you think of this one? Which? This one. "Employees needed by Macchiato Dulce" That's your agency! They would kill me. Nothing like that. Send your CV. Impossible. I could never be your agent. Youre chicken. Youre losing your rhythm. Shut up! I'll do it my way... I need a punching bag that's human. I got you! I'll get you, asshole! "Since she wanted me, I ask myself up to what point I became more respectable." Goethe Coming! Sorry for being late. It's because of the job interview. Here! You bought a cake? This is not like you. Its for celebrating. What? They gave me the job. Really? Great! I'll get some candles. Don't even think about it. It's not your birthday. Looks great! Yummy! Wait! Come. Sit down! For what? Do as I say! Today, in order to celebrate I will draw you. I am far too shy to be a Model. It's an honor, you should be happy. How should I pose? Do you have a preferred pose? Not really! So do whatever you like. I'm embarrassed. How come? We know already. What do you mean by that? You have been with worse guys, no? Let me see. Over my dead body. Come on, show me! Im naked! That's how you turn me on. - Get it! - Great, isn't it? Chidori. Noeru! Noeru! Further edits into vernacular, American English: FootStudNY This way we regret nothing right, Noeru? "If somebody asks why I loved the way I did I'll answer that both of us were authentic. That is my only answer." Montaigne
