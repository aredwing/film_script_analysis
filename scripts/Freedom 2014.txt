No one can shackle the hope that is hidden in our hearts. If only you will believe it, Samuel. You're late. I got held up. Had to break up a fight in one of the cabins. Jackson! Robert! Get the horses! Didn't hold Jerome long enough off cabin 15. You go ahead. Meet you at the bridge. I'll fetch them dogs away. - God help us. - God bless you, Big Hand. - There he is! - Come on! Get him! He's getting away! Are you sure, Samuel? Yeah. Where's Big Hand? He'll be by soon, son. Come on. Even as we make our way toward freedom Would it ever be possible to leave behind what we'd endured? Oh, nah-ah! Let's go. Let's go. Lord have mercy! Jesus... He's had enough! - He hasn't talked. - He is nearly unconscious. Where are the others? The others have vanished, Mr. Monroe. Praise God Almighty. Where are they? If they get away because of your stupidity... Now you leave him strung up, yeah? Mm? And get a hold of Plimpton. Plimpton? I want my property back before nightfall. All of you! Back to work. Come on, now. # Swing low # Sweet chariot # And carry me home # Swing low # Sweet chariot # Please come and carry me home # # If you get there # Before I do # Coming to carry me home # Tell all my friends # I'm coming too # Coming to carry me home Samuel? Samuel Woodward? Yes sir. Thomas Garrett. - Mr. Garrett. - You must be Vanessa. Adira? Ma'am. And this is Jim. Hello, son. You've done well. Big Hand? I see. Come on. We begun our long journey north with Mr. Garrett On pathways known only to the Underground Railroad. Mr. Garrett! Come on. Grandma. I got you. I'm all right. Woah, woah! You came. He's been waiting for you. In here. Mm-hm. Woulda never happened in his old man's day. I heard tell... My father was a fool, Plimpton. Took the concept of Christian charity too far. Get out. Slave's expensive, Plimpton. And the Underground Railroad now They are targeting slave owners in Virginia. I'm retired. And there's more when they all get recaptured. All? What, there's more than one? There's Samuel, his son, the old woman, and Vanessa. They're gonna be easy to track. No slave has ever escaped from my plantation. Why don't you send Jerome? I want them back before they insight the others. Garrett's part of it. Garrett? Him and his Quaker cohort they are a menace to our industry. The entire economy of Virginia is at risk. Monroe, I am no longer in the slave hunting business. Now, now, you just - you made a mistake, Plimpton. Made you weak. Don't let your conscience get in the way of business. How's 500 dollars? I'll give you another thousand when you bring And that's including Vanessa. Oh, you can't let her go, can ya? How She's of no use to me. She's too old and too sick. They're gonna be headed north. I'm sending one of my boys with you. I don't need a babysitter. He will look after my interest. They will all be in church on Sunday. Get yourself a shave. You've done well. Most don't make it this far. We had help, Mr. Garrett. Jim. Thank you, Mr. Garrett. Our lives have been... Adira's been a slave all her life. And my son has never seen the sun rise Without the threat of a whipping. One day, we pray. Ain't be the white man's God she pray to. Samuel... Freedom, Samuel. God willing. Freedom. Why you do this, Mr. Garrett? Sammy, you have to trust. Like your momma trusted Monroe? He gonna want you back, Nessa. You're his blood. # Twas grace that brought us # Safe thus far Pa used to sing that song. He loved to sing. You refuse to sing. One day you will, son. Amazing Grace. That saved a wretch like me? I was Jim's age when I first heard it. And the story of the man who wrote it. An infamous slave trader. A wretch like you, Samuel. But he loved to sing. # Kings and queens And oh the man in the moon # # A broken mirror doesn't mean That someone will die soon # # A black cat isn't all bad luck And redheads won't sink a boat # # If you're drowning in the sea Will God keep you afloat? # Yeah! Get out! Congratulation, Captain Newton. Thank you, Mr. Barton. Oh, and, uh, bravo! I remember a song you wrote about old captain Pennrose. Cruel, Newton, but very witty. But I cannot believe you actually bought shares On the After Pennrose died, I acquired his half And am now in partnership with Amos Clowe. Amos Clowe? Clowe owns the slave factory on the Plantain Islands And this will be our first shipment to Charleston. I know you've had difficulties with Amos, Newton. He promised me an apprenticeship, Barton But he treated me like an animal. Like one of his slaves. He actually chained and starved me for 18 months. It's all in the past. It's all a means to a good end. And now, as we always planned You have the opportunity to share in the profits Captain Newton. Now, I have to go to Charleston to set up the slave market. I'll meet you there on your arrival. Time is against us. I need you to leave this week To pick up the first load in Africa. But, Mary. Your fiance will want for nothing. That's a lot of money, Newton. Now, the first mate, Davey, will take care of the cargo. I'll be giving you one of Amos' slaves He'll interpret for you. Name's Ozias. My business is now your business. To ambition. Good luck, Newton. It is blood money. Mary, I'm simply the captain of Barton's ship. I don't own it, nor the cargo. To me, and I'm sure to your fellow parishioners And most of this nation, it is just business. You speak of business and I speak of your soul. - Let's not argue, please. - A soul that I love. Mary! Mr. Newton! We'll marry as soon as I return. I only pray that God allows it. I'll be away for six to eight months. You know the perils of the sea. If I don't return... - John... - If I don't come back... I need to know you'll be cared for. I don't want you to go. I fear this time I shall never see you again. Mr. Newton! I shall pray every day for your return. Have faith, Mary. I do. John, I do. # It is well # With my soul # It is well # It is well with my soul # Though Satan should buffet # Though trials should come # Let this blest assurance control # # That Christ hath regarded # My helpless estate # And hath shed # His own blood for my soul # It is well # with my soul # It is well Come on, keep it moving. # It is well with my soul One seven, move along. 148. No... Welcome aboard, Captain Newton. - Is it Davey? - Yes, sir. Your first mate. One moment, Mr. Davey. Ozias. Captain Newton, the trunk's already in your cabin. - Thank you, Bosun. - Bless you, sir. Welcome on board the Pegasus. Get back to work, slave. That one there. Pick him up. Come on. No... no... No, no, no... He set sail that day to a new world. A soul without a compass... Like you Samuel... Confused... Confronted by his past. Desperately hoping To find his freedom and his fortune On a slave ship. Have faith, Samuel. Whoah. Usual conditions, Plimpton. Always a pleasure. We got a family of slaves this time, Clem. I sent word on ahead. Who's this? He's here as my watchdog. I said be ready at sunrise, boy. If you ride with me, you follow my orders, you understand? We won't have a problem, Mr. Plimpton. Who's this? He's my tracker, Clem. Do we bring them back dead or alive? We bring That's a damn shame. Mm-hm. Come on, let's get going. Come on, come on. I got you, momma. We're nearly there. Come on. Ha! There's the cavalry. Right on time. Who comes here? Mr. Garrett. It's been a long time, sir. - Mr. McGee. - Very good to see you. Hey, Pete. Made quite a stretch sir. There room for all of us, sir? Yes, sir. There's room for all of you. Even Mr. Garrett. Alright, come on. Ma'am. You'll connect with Philips With a freight train off of Philadelphia Get the family to Woodbridge And I'll take you there part of the way. All right, sir. Hey, ride up here. It's fine. # # I'm on my way # # To Canaan's Land # # I'm on my way # # To Canaan's Land # # I'm on my way # # To Canaan's Land # I'm on my way # Praise the Lord, I'm on my way # # It's a mighty hard road # # but I'm on my way # I'm like you, Samuel. I don't sing. I'm a Quaker. # I'm on my way # # To Canaan's Land # I'm on my way # Yes my Lord, To Canaan's Land # - Yah! - How far? It's a couple miles further on. Your fellow escapee, Big Hand He was caught. We also heard that Monroe sent Plimpton after you. How many men he got with He's got two. That's it? We got more that that. The Railroad doesn't go out of its way To confront these people. Our fate is in God's hands And we'll protect you with His guidance. Gentlemen, we got a problem. We got two roads blocked, one just up ahead. Oh, he must want you back real bad. And we're gonna be exactly what we are. Slaves. Woah... ho... ho... # Pa, are they gonna catch us? Hush up now, boy. All right. Hey. What have we got here? Hold up. What's going on here? Looking for runaways. All we got's these miserable slaves. Uh-huh... This one ain't so miserable. That's not your property, mister. Leave These ain't runaways. If they were, I'd take another trip for you. All right. All right, come on through. Much obliged. Found sets of tracks, boss. Garrett's with them alright. Hey, a wagon. How long are you gonna take, Plimpton? Already a day behind. Monroe will get his slaves back Sunday. Let's move. Yah! Come on. We Quakers don't believe in guns, Samuel But I am occasionally grateful that Mr. McGee does. Should be the last time you have to wear these. There you are, Jim. Valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil. Hope can be found in the darkest of places. No one is alone. Believe me, Samuel. There's always hope. Learn from those who have gone before you. # I am a poor pilgrim of sorrow # # I'm tossed in this wide world alone # # No hope have I for tomorrow # So I've started # To make Heaven my home # Sometimes # I'm tossed and driven, Lord # Sometimes I don't know # Where to roam # But I have heard of # A city called Heaven # And I've started # Making my home # Sometimes # I'm tossed and driven, Lord # Sometimes I don't know # Where to roam # But I have heard of # A city called Heaven # And I've started # To make Heaven # My home I apologise, I didn't mean to startle you. John Newton. You must think it's strange that I'm in command of a slave ship Owned by Amos Clowe. You still have your Bible I see. God has given you very little, Ozias. Mr. Amos taught me to speak English with this book. But God's words have taught me so much more. God's words? Surely just written by mere mortal men. It wasn't God who came in the night And gave me food and saved my life. You were treated so very poorly by Mr. Clowe. I was flogged on board his Majesty's man-of-war Ozias, for desertion. And now I'm in command of a slave ship. I'm the captain of a slave ship. I've learned to expect nothing from God. I remember one night, the slave factory. I cried out in the dark Your servant listens A huge roar split the heavens, I fell to my knees. I saw the trees bow in His honor I heard the Lord speak my name In the rustle of the barb leaves. God spoke to me. Tell me this, then, Ozias. Why does your just and merciful God Condemn good people like you and me to slavery? There are no good people, John Newton. We are all dogs, hunted, shackled, enslaved. That is why we need God. Captain! Captain! What's going on? He was trying to hang himself, captain. What is he saying? Ozias! He wants to die. Tell him we're taking him to a better place, a new life. He wants his freedom. Some of them are starving themselves too, captain. This is valuable cargo, Mr. Davey. I can't have slaves killing themselves. Doctor? This one is gravely ill. Her son... I don't know. What is it? The flux, captain. There's nothing to be done. Your great grandfather was on that ship, Samuel. A boy struggling to hold on to hope. His survival tied to the fate of captain Newton. Woah. I'll leave you here, Garrett. McGee, you take care. Look out for Plimpton. Samuel. Godspeed, y'all. Y'all take good care, now. You'll make it. Canaan's Land. Here it is. Woah, oh. You, unhitch the horses, Samuel. Who's inside? It's a Quaker house. See that lamp? It's safe. This is where we'll hide you tonight. - Here you go. - Come on. This way, Jim. - Yes? - Watchman... What is left of the night? Morning is coming, but also the night. Come in, Mr. Garrett. - Thank you kindly. - We've been expecting you. Come on in. Here you go. This here is Samuel Woodward and his family. William Giddens. Come in. You must be hungry. Very. There are too many of us. These men are from Missouri. Harriet Tubman brought them across yesterday. We cannot all hide here. There's not enough space. Harriet told us that four more free black men Were kidnapped yesterday. Now, stay calm. There you are. Where're you from? Ah, the Monroe place. The biggest plantation in the Norfolk area. We ran with Mr. Garrett's help. And God's. A chair don't build itself. Your boys at the roadblock were right. I'll go around this way. Boss? Willie? - You're next. - Willie! Giddens! Giddens is the first safe house! Think that Quaker is still running a safe house? He's a bigger fool than the Monroe boy here. Fool? You're running outta time! You told Monroe Sunday! I want no more killing! You hear me? You clean yourself up. We got a long ride ahead of us. We've got visitors. Mr. Plimpton I believe. Samuel? Is there a gun, Mr. Giddens? There will be no shooting in this house! - They're not taking us back! - Nessa! Come on. Out the back. Hitch up the horses to the back. Go. There's no time, Samuel. You need to hide. - Quickly! - There are too many of us. They'll be around here somewhere. Come on! Jim, stay by me. Adira. Let's go. Check this side and go around the back. What can I do for you, mister? Where's Garrett, conductor of the Underground Railroad? You should board the train too, sir. One day we'll all stand at the terminal before God. I don't believe in God, Mr. Giddens. I got nothing to say to Him. - Clem! - Yes, boss. I know where they are. You should never play poker, Mr. Giddens. This isn't them. Where are they? The others. Others? The ones I came for. Garrett and his passengers from Norfolk. - Where are they? - I have nothing to say to you. Search the rest of the house and the barn, and find Willie. Come on! You know, you may just hang for this, Giddens. We mustn't be afraid of death, Mr. Plimpton. Plimpton! Outside! Shi... Go! Samuel! Don't! Come on! Get Get - Shoot - Alive, I said! What a great help you were. Go hitch their horses to the wagon. And get those slaves tied up, now! I'm afraid those gentlemen have gone, Mr. Plimpton. Out the back door. You have lost them all. Dear, dear... You have broken a federal law, Mr. Giddens. The slaves have gone, boss. The fugitive slave act requires That you assist in the recapture of escaping slaves That is the law, sir. I follow my conscience, Mr. Plimpton Whatever the consequences. We're just God fearing folk here. That's all. God fearing folk is my biggest problem. Philips is waiting for us on the platform. Quick now, while the train pulls in. Over there on that car. Philips. Quickly. They're waiting. We made it on time. You connect with the main line at Woodbridge that's where you get off. Then make your way to Pikesville. You ain't coming with us? No. My job is to get you on the train. And my job is done. You'll be looked after every step of the way. Your first taste of freedom, Samuel. - This your compass? - You're made for it. Godspeed. # Oh, if I got my ticket Lord # Can I ride Get all of those over there too. # Oh, if I got my ticket Lord # Can I ride # Oh, if I got my ticket Lord # Can I ride Move it! # Ride away to Heaven On the morning train # # If I got my ticket # # Lord, if I got my ticket # # Lord, if I got my ticket # # Ride away to Heaven In the morning # # I hear them talk About the Gospel train # # I wanna get on it Yeah, that's my aim # # Stand at the station And patiently wait # # The train is coming And it's never late # # So long coming That it worried my mind # Stop that train! # I thought it was late But it was just in time # # Lord, if I got my ticket # # Lord, if I got my ticket # # Lord, if I got my ticket # # Ride away to Heaven In the morning, yeah # # Sometimes I feel # Like a motherless child # Sometimes I feel # Like a motherless child # Sometimes I feel # Like a motherless child # A long ways # From home # A long ways # A long ways from home # Sometimes I feel # Like I'm almost gone # Sometimes I feel # Like I can't go on # Sometimes I feel # Like I'm almost gone # Way up to my heavenly land # Way up to my heavenly land # But I'm a true believer # I'm a true believer # A long ways # From home # A long ways # A long ways # From home # Ooh The boy won't take any food.

I heard you caught a free black man and killed him by mistake. Whatever you say, Willie. I think all coloreds should be slaves... Or dead. Any man who thinks otherwise is a damn fool. This is just a great big game for you, innit boy? Coloreds just got the better of you? That's it, old man! There's the Plimpton from the stories. Not the slave sympathizer Who's running his hunt like he's the Railroad condu... Willie! Enough, Willie. You keep, old man. I'm riding to town. Do what we came here for. Hey, Samuel, we're so close. Have faith. Mr. Douglass will help us. Help us what? Run some more? Probably gonna run us down, Nessa. They gonna beat us, they gonna put the collar to us again. Adira said have faith. Faith... Look what good that did her. No. No, death saved her from where we're going. Sammy, stop, please stop! Not here! Not now. Why? Why God chose us to be half human? To be strung up whenever they want? Huh? To work all our lives and to die? No. This church, this church, this church means nothing! This church means nothing to us!

Let's sell him. Let me hear 20 dollars. 20. Do thee love her, comfort her Honor and keep her in sickness and in health So long as you both shall live? I do. You all know me. But I'm not the same man who left Rochester ten months ago. That John Newton was dramatically changed One night in a storm on the Atlantic ocean. In utter despair I cried out and was given another chance. Take away a toy from a child And give him another And he is satisfied. But if he be hungry, no toy will do. Thus, as newborn babes True believers desire the sincere milk of the word. And the desire of grace in this way Is grace. # Amazing Grace # How sweet the sound # That saved a wretch like me # I once was lost # But now am found # Was blind # But now I see Look, pa! I can see the crossing. Hey! Go on, Samuel. Get Jim across, I'll wait here. Come on, boy. Let's go. We're free, son! We're free! Got you, boy. Hey, boy! Come on back now, boy. Nessa! Don't make me do something stupid. Come on! Willie! Clem, are you with me? We'll split Monroe's money. They're mine. No more killing, I mean it. Monroe told me dead or alive, old man. Clem, you're just gonna stand there? You best get outta here, Clem. I ain't gonna ask again. So you're just gonna shoot Monroe's daughter, huh? I'm all yours, Mr. Plimpton! Shut your mouth, slave boy. No deals! Tell him not to do it, Mr. Plimpton. Shut your mouth, nigger! Nessa! - Samuel! - Come over here. Come on. Why, Mr Plimpton? I've had enough. No more killing.
