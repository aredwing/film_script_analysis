But in surrounding towns... ...groups of rebels and pirates wanted to take control of this wealthy land. In the Buddhist year 2136... ...Yanispree the Dutch weapons genius... ...and his Chinese student Lim Keeam... ...travelled to Langkasuka... ...to bring their best cannon... ...to give to Queen Raya Heejao to protect her country. They were attacked by pirates... ...led by Ekadam who was a master of Dolum... ...and who wanted to steal the cannon. They bombed the Dutchman's boat and Yanispree was killed. And the cannon sank into the sea. Brother Keeam. Can I go with you? You are just a child. Young is good. Light and easy to fly. No, I will not take you. If something happened to you, uncle Unya will kill me. Your uncle is more ferocious than a shark. Quick children. Help me to carry this up. I can fly! You really are an expert! The bird has a broken wing. The bird has a broken wing. If you want to fly in the next life you need to born as a bird! Children. Today I have new inventions to show you. What is it, Brother Keeam? I call them... ...frog's fins! Frog's fins! I believe my new invention... ...will help you to swim quicker. Whoever wants it, follow me. Go, go. Pinthang. What's the matter? I dived to get this for you. Take it. Bring the ambassador from Japan. - Yarang! What are you doing here? - Dad! I won the fighting test... ...so I was promoted to be a protector. You have stayed in Ayutthaya too long. You are really young... ...but still you progress to this position. If your mother was still alive, she would be proud of you. For me to work for Langkasuka will be my life's honor. Same as my father. Bring the ambassador from Eden. Hurry! Take the princesses away! Ekadam! Back! Quick! Uncle Unya. Where are we going? What's that noise? Paree! Quick! Go! Unya. Paree. Pay respect to the master. Is he Arue's son? His name is Paree. Arue and his mother... ...I already know. Why did you bring him here? To ask the master to teach him about Dolum. He has the same characteristics as you. Paree is a water baby. He can speak with his stomach too! Even if he can speak with his feet, it doesn't matter. The science of Dolum is not to be used to kill. But we need someone to get rid of Ekadam. He makes trouble around this sea! Kill Ekadam and we will get another Ekadam. But-- Unya. You must forget about malice... ...and must teach him about love. Don't teach him about hatred. Just teach him Dolum at the basic level. Master grandfather. What is it child? Just a minute ago I heard a strange noise. It is the noise of darkness. Darkness? The darkness has noise? Yes. If you learn Dolum with hatred... ...the darkness will cry out in your mind. Master Krabenkaow does not want teach you. So I will teach you myself. Master grandfather said that learning about evil Dolum will put darkness in your heart. Paree. You must learn about using good Dolum... ...to overcome evil people. Who is the evil person? Ekadam. He was lucky that the poison did not spread so quickly I could not stop it. But he has an injury to his face. Never mind. At least he is still alive. I am pleased. Queen Raya is coming. Don't worry Yaring. The bravery of your son is in the country's favor. I won't let your son be lost. Prince Rawai must pay for this. Dolum has 3 major levels and 9 sub-levels. In the first 3 majors I will teach you... ...to tell the difference between the noise of fish... ...and to know the feeling of air, temperature... ...humidity, tides and winds that touch your body. To know about how fish relateto land, air and sky... ...you must understand fish. You will know the currents... ...and where fish will be. You will know when there will be rain. In the next majors... ...you will learn to send out the power of your voice... ...to control fish... ...to make them do what you want. Or hurt your enemies by connecting your mind with the sea. You must learn Dolum at a high level... ...then you can talk with the fish. Krabenkaow is the only one... ...who can teach you how. The group of dolphin just in front us. I will herd them this way. Pinthang. I give this to you. Paree. Thank you so much... ...for saving my life. I was nearly defeated by them. Is this strange boat yours, Brother Keeam? Yes. And the people who wear the strange masks too. We hired these people. To fight against Ekadam's power for many years. But I still cannot get close to Ekadam. Then I will join with you. One day... ...I will get rid all of these people who attacked me. Calm down. Every problem can be solved given time. What is your plan? Even now we still cannot get the cannon out of the sea. But if every group of pirates in this sea cooperates... ...and comes together as partners... ...every job will become easier. Why do you think they will work together with us? It is clear to see that our Langkasuka... ...is not able to make a powerful cannon by ourselves. We need to find a new person who can make a cannon quickly! Why do we need to hurry? Our country has no sign of war. Leekadei. As long as Prince Rawai is still alive... ...we must be careful. Langkasuka is a big empire. So why have we still not found a cannon maker? Toeraman. What do you have to say? Yanispree the Dutch weapons genius... ...has a student who lives here. Really? What is his name? Lim Keeam. How you know this? A few days ago... ...I was drinking with the ambassador of Holland, called Quan de Vean. When drunk, he said he survived an attack on a boat... ...that carried the cannon from Holland. Another survivor was Lim Keeam. Quan de Vean said he lives at the Sea Gypsy village. Find this Lim Keeam. If he works for our enemy, kill him. And if he doesn't come to us, kill him too. Auhu. I worry about the man who will be your husband. So beautiful and adept at fighting. As everybody knows. Who are you? You dare to enter a forbidden area. I am a guest of your country. You have no manners. You dare to disturb my practice. I apologize. Who are you? I'm Hubdul Fakumu Idim. Prince Pahang. Auhu. In a next few days you will be engaged. And next year you will be married. No man likes a woman who carries a weapon. But I don't want to be married. Prince Pahang has now arrived. If he sees you now, he will change his mind. He saw Auhu already. And I dismissed him already. Auhu. Watch your manners. Langkasuka is single state. Pahang is a friend that we must keep. I must marry for this reason? The King of Nakhon Si Thammarat and Sultan of Songkhla... ...are ready to attack us at any time. And Prince Rawai joins with the pirate Ekadam. We have enemies everywhere. Isn't this reason enough? Congratulation. Lord Vendever. Your company are better we're expecting, is trade activity very fast. I'm very grateful for Langkasuka's help. But indeed, the regional trade would see even brighter future... ...if the Dutch will enjoy the right as sole trader. Sir Vendever, a meal won't be so appetizing if you eat it a lot. Ambassador. Are you comfortable in your accommodation? Very comfortable. You are very kind Princess Beeroo. This is Miss Lim. She came with me from China. She is the daughter of an important trader in Guangzhou. Lim Korneiw. Miss Lim. Is this your first time in Langkasuka? Yes. I came here with the ambassador to find my brother. Does your brother live here? Yes. He has lived here for many years. His name is Lim Keeam. Lim Keeam who was Yanispree's student? Yes. I promised my mother I will bring my brother back to China. If I fail, I cannot go back. We want to see him. Can you take us to see him with you? Yes. The people in Langkasuka are close to finding a cannon maker. Could people really survive from our raid at that time? Another important thing is that... ...Langkasuka are joining families with Pahang. When these two countries become one family... ...ourjob becomes more difficult. I think that it is time... ...to see the power of our partners. Who you think will be best? The Japanese pirates. The Wagrob people. Paree. My life is yours. May i present the gift from Chorentokkol. Bring Harut Mokul, the ambassador from Songkhla. These are gifts from Sultan Sulaiman. Rachid Fanee the ambassador from Yaho. Check around. I will look inside. Brother Unya! Brother Keeam! Stop! Otherwise this old man dies. He's caliber one for me! - They cannot. - Never! Light it! Light it now! Go! Master. Brother Keeam. Brother Keeam. Pinthang! Pinthang! Pinthang! Pinthang! Pinthang! I apologize to you. Princesses Beeroo and Auhu are busy elsewhere... ...and cannot be here to say goodbye to you. I will inform you right away... ...when Princess Auhu is ready to marry you. I thank you for your kindness... ...but this time is close to the monsoon season... ...so I need to go back to my home. So I say goodbye for now. I thank you for Yarang's bravery too. Thank you for your kindness. So you try to steal my boat? You should not make other people suffer because of you. But never mind. I needed to come here to get rid of you. But I got to experience all of the women in your village. I can tell you... ...all of the women were most enjoyable. Come here! The brave warrior. Let him die as they all die! Very strange. In all the village there is just one injured man. And there are a lot of dead bodies. He does not look like a local person. So give the telescope to the Princess. Paree. You are still a child. How is mother? In the past I only wanted to revenge my master. I didn't think it would come to this. All because of my arrogance. How dare I plan to do more? I feel sympathy for you Mr. Lim... ...but they will not die for nothing... ...if you help us make a cannon to fight against them. In the past... ...I helped you when I cut off Ekadam's power. I don't want anybody to die because of me again. Do I have a choice? You can think about it. But if you refuse... ...you must back to China with your sister. This time I'll do the job very well. Princess. You should be glad... ...that I came to take you myself. Go. Take them to the boat. Quick. Go! Go! Go! Go! Take them there. Take them to the jail! Brother Lim Keeam. Brother. Lim Korneiw. Who are you? My name is Yarang. I am a solider of Langkasuka. Thank you very much. You are? Yarang! Let's go Princess! Paree! Get away! They will not kill me. Hurry to help the other people first. Hurry on! This way. You go first, Princess. What about Auhu? You go first Princess. We cannot delay. You killed my wife! I will kill you! I will kill you myself! Yarang! Yarang! Ekadam! Auhu! Auhu! We cannot lose you. I will not lose you too! There! Shoot them! The master is still alive. I am saddened. What are you saddened about? I am saddened that your smile is gone. The light in your eyes from ten years ago. It is different now. Paree. Malevolence never ends. I can't help it. They killed everyone I loved. If you don't kill them have they still killed people you love? Please forgive them. And let revenge end at you. Then you will have a wider appreciation of life. Forgiveness cannot return life. My father, my mother... ...Uncle Unya. And my lover are all dead. Then will revenge... ...help your father, your mother, Unya... ...and your lover to live again? Where is this? Koh Kraben. My home. Where will you go? Back to Langkasuka, my home. You will not be able to go anywhere for a while. Why? You will be shark food. This is monsoon time. With these waves and wind, we cannot take a boat out. Beeroo. Beeroo. Are you alright? I'm okay. But Auhu... What about Auhu? I could not protect Princess Auhu. I am ready to die as my punishment. I believe you did your best and Langkasuka is indebted to you again. I will find the bastard spy who caused the death of my sister. Who are you? Why are you here? And who are you? Why are you here? My name is Paree. My name is Krabendam. Krabendam. How are you related to grandfather Krabenkaow? He locks me in this darkness. Even though he is no different from me. Is he your teacher? He does not want to teach me. Grandfather said my mind is full of hatred. Full of hatred is good. I will teach you myself. This is the power of hatred. I hope you have the answer that I want to hear. You seem to love your sister a lot. Remember that you only have the time in this monsoon season. Put your breath down into your stomach. Then push the breath around your body. Paree. You learn quicker than all my other students. If you had more hatred... ...you would learn even quicker. Pinthang. Pinthang. Release me Paree. Release me now! Paree. The darkness dominates your mind. You must think of good things. Auhu. Don't blame him. Tides come and go. Low tides affect the mind of Dolum practitioners. At low tide, their minds will be low too. Their passions will be difficult to control. So Dolum is not a good thing. I won't practice any more. Everything has two sides. If you know how to use it, it will be more useful. Paree. If you continue to learn Dolum from Krabendam... ...before long... ...you will not be second best to Ekadam or Krabendam. Why do you lock Krabendam away. Krabendam has done many bad things. I cannot allow him to escape to the outside. What has he done? Krabendam excelled in Dolum. Before long... ...he become a teacher in the palace... ...and had an affair with the king's concubine. One day... ...Krabendam took Prince Demato's dagger... ...and killed the king... ...to help Prince Rawai to succeed to the throne. One day... ...I will kill him with his own dagger. Work faster! Did you make a false cannon? Krabenkaow. I don't want to hurt you. You are Krabenkaow. Dolum made grandfather like this. Auhu. I have still not apologized for what I did before. You have given me my first kiss. Though I did not allow you to kiss me. I just want to help. Don't be afraid of me. I'm okay now. This is the reason why I lock myself in the cave. Everyone who practices Dolum... ...all have their weaknesses. The problem will hide deep and uncontrolled in their mind. It is on the side of evil. When I feel the power of evil dominate my mind I will use Dolum to enter this cave to calm down. When my mind comes back, I come out of the cave. Paree. Now you give me no choice. So, from tomorrow... ...I will teach you about good Dolum. Thank you grandfather. How you will answer this? If you kill me, you will get nothing. Release my sister first. Then I will answer. Go! I don't think that... ...you are able to bargain in this situation. Do you know what will happen with your sister? If your cannon doesn't work? Wait! Release her. But my cannon is still not as good... ...as the cannons of my master, Yanispree. Go! Get out! I think that... ...we need to hurry to find Master Kraben. Dolum is the way... ...to combine the power of humans with the power of fish. Animals and humans are all born with problems. The fish's problem is food. Human problems are desire... ...power... ...hatred... ...stupidity... ...and resentment. Ekadam's island... ...has only one way to get in and out. It is a nook that cannot be seen from outside. I think that... ...we can use this single entrance and exit... ...to turn their stronghold into their prison. But first of all... ...we must send some one to rescue Lim Keeam and his sister. You must ready a special army. We will attack the island when the monsoon ends. Yes, your highness. If we work together... ...attacking Langkasuka will not be difficult. When we will attack them? The Nagaza army are paid mercenaries. We need time to gather soldiers. We can spend time during the monsoon collecting soldiers. In the tenth lunar month... ...we will attack Langkasuka together. Good. I miss kissing the women from Langkasuka. I am a Javanese pirate. Even though we have few soldiers... ...our soldiers are professional fighters. Will you give me fair reward? Don't worry. To the pirate army! The pirate army. The two cannon are built dedicated to Langkasuka. The kingdom of Bahadusa has been a great help to us. So, I built the best cannon, as a gift, to his majesty, the king's daughter. In order to defend her kingdom. Remember Lim Keeam, being able to show appreciation... ...is a very important thing. Cannon A, is design to had great firing range. While cannon B, power is most irritating. They're border messing, my master. No, they're no. Imagine what would happen, combine the strength of these two cannon. Master! When he completes the sixth level, my work is done. He must learn the higher levels by himself. I have not seen grandfather for many days. Maybe this is the time for us to go back. But I have had good times on this island. Many good things to remember. And I want it to be like this forever. Everybody will think I'm dead by now. But at least... ...while I still live... ...you will always live in my heart. Auhu. Let me send you home. You're smiling. I've never seen you smile before. Yaring has gone to Pahang. Good. Hopefully Yaring will make Prince Pahang understand our situation. I have come to say goodbye. I, with twenty nine soldiers will attack Ekadam's island tomorrow night. I wish you good luck and success. Langkasuka depends on you. Thank you, your highness. I will protect Langkasuka with my life. Be careful Yarang. What kind of weapon... ...will you need make for them to kill people? Don't look at me like that. I don't have a choice. But I do. I don't think that Langkasuka... ...can make a powerful cannon like this, for sure. For sure. If it is like this... ...our spies will let us know. Good! Goodbye brother Lim Keeam. Go put the bombs around the outside. Let's go. Go! Who's that? Go see! Oh! My sister. Mr Lim. Mr Lim. We must leave now. Quick! Paree! Paree stop! Paree enough! Paree! Paree! I love you! Princess Auhu. - Auhu? - Don't speak. Let's get out here quickly. Go and look! Shoot him! Otherwise we will all die together. Don't. Paree, be careful! Shoot! Be careful Princess! Paree! Paree! Paree! Paree! Paree! Paree! Prince. My son. I will name you Rawai. You are hurt. Are you hurt a lot? Just a small injury, sister. A long way from my heart. In this battle... ...they took a lot of damage. But us. All our best soldiers are dead. War. It's the beginning of bloodshed that never ends. Now... ...these insurgents have a boat with a powerful cannon. We will see a lot of bloodshed. We have two more heroes... ...who gave their lives for Langkasuka. I will not allow my sister... ...and Paree... ...to die for nothing, your majesty. We will arrange the marriage ceremony of Princess Auhu and Prince Pahang quickly. I agree. We need the army from Pahang. So send Princess Auhu to Pahang quickly. Immediately after Yaring comes back. But Auhu. What about Auhu? I'm ready... ...for my marriage with prince Pahang. Let everything end at yourself. And you will understand the emptiness of life. Let's be quick! Pahang is busy preparing for the marriage ceremony. They will not be able to send an army in time. I will let them have a second chance. Tell our army to leave this island and join the pirates at Kulapayong. And inform them that... ...my father and I will arrived later with a large gift. Quick! Father. After the marriage ceremony... ...Princess Auhu will return with the army from Pahang. Do you think she will arrive in time? With the time we have, I believe that... ...the two cannons here... ...will be ready in time to fight... ...against the insurgents. But I am afraid that... What are you afraid of? That they might retrieve my teacher's cannon from the sea. But we don't really know. Don't be scared before you really know. But we should not be careless because we don't know the numbers of our enemies. But for their navy... ...I have a way to deal with them. But I need more army engineers. Father. Be careful. My cannon... ...will be good as my teacher's great cannon. The pirate army have attacked a town already Yarang. There are many of them. We must shoot to stop them. Don't let them get in here. Artillerymen! Prepare yourselves! Set the cannons ready to shoot! Pirate army! Get ready to advance! Fire! Double the powder! Prepare to shoot higher! Fire! Give the sign to Mahalalo's navy to shoot! Fire! Is Lim Keeam's cannon ready or not? Together at the same time! Good. Careful! We must fight to keep the battle line! Don't let them get closer! Put it down here! Quick! Load it! Set the cannon in place! Fire! Did you see that! Load it again! Quickly! I will leave this duty to you for now. I need to go to get my new weapon ready to fight! Lim Keeam is as good as Yanispree! Continue firing! Don't let them get closer! Put the weapons down! Raya Heejao! Leekadei, you traitor! Toeraman! Raya Heejao. Tell your soldiers to stop shooting. If they don't you will die. So it was you! Bastard traitor! Why are you? Yes. I did it for my grandson. I will name you Rawai. Princess Beeroo. Put the sword down. Quickly! Raya Heejao. Order them to stop shooting now! Quickly! Quickly! I yield my life for my country. You can kill me! Raya Heejao! Sure. You will die as you want! Sister Auhu. - Langkasuka depends on you. - Go! Kill them all! Fire! Stop shooting! Soldier! You are all traitors? Yarang. Continue shooting! Don't worry about me! Fire! The great cannon! Soldiers! We must hurry! Is that the great cannon? Raya Heejao! For Rawai, my grandson! No! Sister! Raya Heejao! Don't worry about me. Just don't let them in. General! Soldiers! Be on guard! Get ready to fight to the death for our honor and our queen! Fire! Shoot them! Winged army! Follow me! Hey! Give me a gun! Fire! For Langkasuka! Paree! In the end, you got to the highest level of Dolum. Father! Father! Please forgive me. I came to stop this. I didn't want to hurt anybody. Let everything end at yourself. And you will understand the emptiness of life. Long live the Queen! Once you have given up everything... ...your clear mind... ...will make your body become one with the sea.
