Quietly listen to the pleas of my heartbeats... - Rest in my arms, oh dear. - Oh dear! What do the words have to convey any longer... ...when your eyes narrate a hundred stories every moment? The fragrance that lingers through the air... ...tempts my youthful desires. The fragrance that lingers through the air... ...tempts my youthful desires. I shall make your nights colourful. I shall hold you in my embrace. Let your hints be. Don't let me speak. Lest our youth is spent talking. The fragrance that lingers through the air... ...tempts my youthful desires. The fragrance that lingers through the air... ...tempts my youthful desires. Your killer gaze... Stops me on my path... Don't look at me like this. No, don't eye me. Your eyes narrate 100 stories every moment. The fragrance that lingers through the air... ...tempts my youthful desires. The fragrance that lingers through the air... ...tempts my youthful desires. On silky black nights come to me in my dreamy rendezvous. - Come into my arms, oh dear. - Oh dear! Quietly listen to the pleas of my heartbeats... - Rest in my arms, oh dear. - Oh dear! What do the words have to convey any longer... ...when your eyes narrate 100 stories every moment? - Hello? - Sam! - Where are you? - Mom! Mom my foot! I've been calling up the motel for a while. They said that you didn't return since last night. Chill, Mom! You have stopped obeying me ever since your dad passed away. Mom, I was just two years old when dad passed away. Shut up! Tell me where you are. I'm at my friend's place. Had you looked for a house of your own... ...you wouldn't have had to live at a friend's place like this. Who's this friend? A close friend, mom. It's your first day at work today. Instead of fooling around with your friends... ...you should've been praying all night. That's what I was doing all night, mom. Okay. Okay. Don't forget to call me tonight - Okay, mom. - Okay then, bye. Hey! Sam. Hi, I'm Kunal. I know. How do you know? Oh Kunal! Oh Kunal! Oh... Kunal! Before this, I hadn't heard anybody's name so many times in one night. I feel like I already know you. Thanks. I have to go. First day on the job. Wish you all the best! See you around. See you. So you're actually a nurse? And you studied five years to become one... a nurse? But why? I mean, you could've studied the same and become a doctor. Why a nurse? Nurse, I'm ready for my sponge bath. Hi, good looking! There's a bad news. What? I have to come over to your place again... ...tonight for a creative meeting, right? Very funny! I hope your sense of humour helps you to find a new house. Find a house? Oh! No. No. Oh yes! Yes. I've found a new tenant and he's even paying me cash. Taxi! Taxi, taxi. Come on, man! Taxi! Kunal? - Sam, right? - Right. Right. Look, dude I'm really sorry, but I'm in a hurry. Why don't you get another cab? Okay. Wait a minute. Why should I get another cab? I stopped this one first No, dude. I stopped this cab first. No, I stopped it first. It's my cab. No, dude. It's my cab. Hey, bro! This is my cab. Do you guys want to tell me where you want to go... ...or do you want to get off? 5th and Alpine... 16 B. 16th floor. The elevators are that way. It's strange how we keep bumping into each other It's like fate But what matters is who's fated to get this house. Come in. Wow! Hey! Why are you scaring me? Hey! You're Indian. No, I'm Chinese. Is this your house? No, it's the neighbours'. Shall I call them? No, no. We've come to check out the house. Did you check it out? Is it good? Now leave. - What do you mean? - I mean, didn't the agent tell you... ...that 'baby' lives alone over here. Baby? Baby. - Look, Baby... - Excuse me. Men aren't allowed here. I want girls even in the two vacant rooms here. After all, it's a question of our security and honour. Did you hear that? Yes, security and honour. But whose? No that... there are two rooms... Sweet! You said sweet, you're hitting on me. - No... - Get out! - No, no... - Out! - Ma'am... - Out! Out! Get out! - No, wait. Wait... - Wait... - Out! Get out! Scoundrel! No boys, only girls. Even we want that, but not in that sense. - Hey! Do you want a hot dog? - Sure. So what else do you do other than bumping into me everywhere? I work at Howard Medical Centre. Two please! Oh doctor? That's cool! No, I'm actually a nurse. Do you also have to wear a short skirt? That's a very old one. What do you do? I'm a photographer. Cool! So do you... with the models... you know... Radical! When did you come from India? Three years ago. You've been looking for a house for three years? I live at a friend's place. But I have to acate now. That too in two week's. - Tough luck, dude! - Yes! Sir, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. Really, I'm just... ...it's just that my boyfriend... ...has been sent to Iraq and I'm here... ...and we were so happy after Afghanistan... Everything was perfect. I mean, we were like the perfect family and I just saw... ...the two of you standing here and you look so happy. My God! You just reminded me so much of us. I mean, really. God bless you both, I mean... - I really wish you all the happiness! - Thank you. Bye. Kunal. - Are you crazy?! - Listen to me. - Don't touch me! Oh man! I'm not like that. You're like my brother. I mean, you are my brother. Albeit from another mother but you're my brother. Look, brother from another mother. You may be desperate, but I'm not. Do whatever you want to. Come on buddy. Had I been able to do it alone then I'd have done it. But she won't believe my word alone. Listen to me. Look, even you agree that the apartment is brilliant. Correct? Right. If we have to lie to an old 'Baby' that we're gay... ...in order to get that house, then what difference does it make? It does make a difference. I'm not gay. I know. I know this. You know this. And if you wish, I shall inform every girl in Miami... ...that you like girls. We just won't tell Baby about it. Think about it. That apartment has two rooms. The apartment is within our budget. And you're more desperate than me. I mean, you have a deadline of two weeks. That's why... What do you say? Are you gay? You've come back! Baby! Are you taking advantage of Baby just because she's alone No, no. No, you're mistaken about us. What do you mean? Shall we come in and explain? Are you trying to be naughty? No, no. I'm taking permission. Okay. What are you looking around for? Do you intend to steal? No, you're very funny. Actually we should've told you earlier that we can rent this house. How can you rent it? I told you that only girls are allowed. We're both are girls. What?! Kunal and I are together. Yes, I can see that. No, I mean... ...we're with each other... you know... What are you saying? I don't understand. Kunal is a special friend of mine. My most special friend. Yes, now I understand. Today's friendship day. Happy friendship day. Happy friendship day. We're gay. He's my boyfriend. Oh God! Oh, my God! Relax. Relax. Don't worry. - Relax, sit down. - Relax. Sit. Sit... Relax, aunty. We're telling you this so that you think carefully before deciding. Exactly. And if there are two girls staying here instead of us... ...then just think about what could possibly happen. They'd bring their boyfriends here at night... ...and then there would be parties, cigarettes, booze, fooling around... Oh, my God! Yes. But if there are two guys like us... ...then there's no question of a third person... ...because we're already together and will always be. Isn't it, Kunal? Moreover, as you said, there's the security angle too. If two guys like us, strong and fit... ...stay with you, then you'll hae security too. Isn't it? Plus aunty, who pays attention to age these days? You live alone in such a big house, anything can happen... Why are you scaring me? Anyway, I don't stay here. Neha stays here. Neha? Yes, my niece. - Girl? - Sister's? - Sit quietly over here. I'll be right back. - Okay. Dude... What's this twist in the story? Where did her sister's... Neha crop up from? Okay. I'm going. Going? Wait, sit down. You talk about leaving at the slightest. Just wait. Let me think. Got it. Listen. I guess we'll have to tell Neha the same thing that we told aunty. Are you crazy? One by one. Do you want to tell eerybody that we both are... That we're gay. Kunal, you're such a... Think about it. If the aunt is like this, then how do you think Neha will be? If I had my way... ...then I'd say this to aunty's entire family let alone Neha. Hi. How can I help you? Neha dear, it's good that you came. These two boys have come to check out the house. Aunty, they... I know they're boys. Hey, tall guy! What's your name? Sameer. And what's your name? Hi, I'm Kunal. Hi, Neha. - Sameer, just a moment. Could you excuse us? - Sure. Wow! Enough, let's go. What? Why? Aunty, how can I stay with two guys? Don't worry. They both aren't what we are. What? Sindhi? Not Sindhi. They both are modern boys. I can't pretend to be gay in front of a girl like that. Okay, no problem. Don't be gay, be homeless instead. - No problem. - They're boyfriend and girlfriend. Oh, gay! I won't stay in this house with that girl, pretending to be gay. It's over. I'm going. Kunal, wait. Just wait. Calm down. It wasn't like this in the old days. In our days guys used to like girls. How sweet! Talk to Neha at least once. Who knows? Maybe only the aunt requires girls! Yes, okay. I'm going. Kunal, just wait. Kunal... Hi! Nice room. - Yes, I thought I'll show you the room. - Sure. - You've already seen this. I hope you like it. - Sure. There are two rooms. There's another one over there. But there's only one bathroom. It's connected. Wow! Actually, we both like sharing bathrooms. That way... Nice. Very nice. Sorry, this way. So this is the bathroom. What's the rent? 2,000 for each room. But since you guys are the first you can decide which one you want. - Personally, I love this room. - What do you mean 'which' room? Both of you will share a room, right? What? - Kunal... - Shut up! Just shut up! We'll not share a room. It'll just be more expensive for you. Two rooms, that's 4,000! - Yes, Kunal. Neha is right. - Yes! - It'll be expensive. - Okay, we'll find another place. No, no. Cute. I love it when he jokes. So sweet! Neha, actually, we'll take both rooms. It'll be easier for you too. I mean you don't have to look for another tenant. - Cool with me. - Yes! - Any questions? - No, no. Are you single? Look at the terrace. It's beautiful. The light is clear. Nice. Show me. - Do you want to see it? - Show me. Sort it out with her. I'll sort it out with her. Will you stop doing this? - Whats single? - Just go and talk to her. - Shut up - Just keep aunty a way. Wow! A pool. But listen... huge apartment... didn't think when I bought it and now the bank loan... Neha, this whole gay thing. You're cool with it, right? Because you know, what difference does it make... You know, who's straight and who's gay... Yes, absolutely! I mean, it's your personal choice. - To each their own. - Right, right. Thank you. - Gay rights. - Yeah! Yeah! - Because your aunt had scared us a bit... - Aunt? - Yes, your aunt. She's very scary. - Don't worry about her. No, no. You'll get used to it. Yes, I hope so because when we came she was like... We don't want boys. We want girls... So you know, we both were just wondering... ...that if she's the only one who has a problem with boys... ...or do you also feel like that? Well, I didn't think that I'd be with boys... Sam! Hey! What are you doing here? All this isn't allowed here. Stand straight. What are you doing? What? What do you do professionally? Well, I'm a photographer. Will you click pictures if I model? Hey, tall fellow! Why are you laughing? What do you do? I'm a nurse. Nurse?! Nurse, do they make you wear short skirts too? Since when have the two of you been a couple? Well, three years. Three years? - Wow! - That's a really long time. Very good. Very good. Tell me your love story. Love story? Where did the two of you meet for the first time? We? We... We... we... Go on, tell us. Don't be shy. No, we met in Venice. Venice! I met Kunal in Venice the first time. In that very first meeting, Kunal showed me a thousand dreams. I felt as if I was standing and the ground below was moving. My heart beat faster. I gasped for breath... Is this my first love? For the next few days, fate made us bump into each other. At times here, at times there... ...and finally I gathered the courage and said something to him. Why are you following me around? Alas! Why didn't my tongue shred to pieces?! He left so suddenly that I never saw him after that. I searched a lot for him. I didn't even know his name to call out to him! Dearest, beloved, my darling? But he was nowhere to be found. Tired and defeated, I returned to my hotel. There was a letter waiting for me. My first love letter in which it was written... "At the seashore, my heart calls out to you..." Oh! I immediately wore my new Gucci shoes with my Armani jacket... ...and set off towards my destiny. Kunal was on the other side of the sea. My legs trembled as I moved towards him. Bathed in the moonlight, with a rose clenched... ...between his teeth, Kunal. Kunal... And then a sigh escaped his soft lips. What a wonderful story! It was beautiful. That's so sweet. I think I'm going to cry. Sweet, baby. Sweet. - All right. - Yes. Okay. Welcome to the family. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. With you around, the crooked pathways... Ridiculous and crazy talk, everything seems fine. With you around, false promises and... ...the intentions of my enemies all seem true. The only thing that makes my heart skip a beat... ...it's you. Only you. You're the one who makes me laugh while I cry. You're the one... - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be alright. - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. The entire world is on one side and we're on the other. Every joy evaporates. I find only sorrow. But when you smile for me, the world seems all right. My life blooms again in a moment. I don't know why. - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. Yeah... yeah, yeah. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. Yeah... yeah, yeah. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. Yeah... yeah, yeah. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. Yeah... yeah, yeah. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. It's a friendship that has blossomed... ...with every passing moment. I don't know why I feel... ...I know her. Because when you smile for me, the world seems all right. These passing moments freeze right here. I don't know why... - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. With you around, the crooked pathways... Ridiculous and crazy talk, everything seems fine. With you around, false promises and... ...the intentions of my enemies, all seem true. The only thing that makes my heart skip a beat... ...it's you. Only you. You're the one who makes me laugh while I cry. You're the one... - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. - I don't know why. - I don't know why. My heart knows that if you're around, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. What happened? Mom, man! I mean, I've come here all the way from London... ...yet I'm not able to get mom off my back. Come on, Sam! How can anybody want to get rid of their mom? You don't know my mom. Still... It's like a full-on hardcore Punjabi ham scene. Tears pour down for the silliest things, dialogues, everything. And day or night it's always the same thing. Why don't you get married? Mrs. Khanna's cousin from... ...Amritsar has two daughters. It's a buffet. Choose whichever you want. Oh, my God! So you haven't told your mom about you... You know, you and Kunal... No, she's very conservative. So tell me, Neha, if Sam and I were not gay... ...then would you have had us as your tenants? Of course not! Because if you hadn't been gay... ...then sooner or later you would have been interested in me... ...and then life would've become strange. Wow! You're so modest. Seriously, my mom and dad wouldn't have allowed it. - Mom? - Dad? They're also there? No, they passed away in a car crash. I was nine years old then. Since then I think of them whenever... ...I have to make an important decision. Like what would they hae done in my position? So what would they have said? About what? You know, about this situation of ours. Oh! I think they'd have been a little happy and a little sad too. Meaning? Happy because I'm living with two strong men. And the butt talk? Sad... sad... why would they be sad? Right. And they'd be sad that my roommates protect me... ...not my husband or my boyfriend. That's ok, we're no less than other men. We're two regular Gabbars (villain in the film 'Sholay'). - Gabbar! - What? Yes, Gabbar. Gabbar Singh from the movie "Sholay". But what does he have to do with this? Come on, Kunal. Haven't you seen the film? Gabbar was gay! Gabbar wasn't gay. Okay, if a man walks around with a belt in his hand... ...throughout a movie, asking the same question... "How many men were there?" Then he has to be gay, right? - Shut up, Sam. - Dude, Gabbar wasn't gay. Of course he was gay. He was a full-on flamer. - Shut up, Sam! - He was... he was gay. He was gay. - Dude! - Now don't tell me that there wasn't anything... ...between Munna and Circuit (movie characters). I mean, come on. That was by far the most obvious one. Circuit addresses Munna as a brother would. So? Even I call you brother in public. Guys, what are you doing here? We have to file papers. I know, but the queue for gay couples is there. - Queue for gay couples?! - Yes. If you file a petition as a couple then... ...you get a residency permit much faster. Maybe even in a year or else it'll take you at least five years. What? You didn't know that? Come on. I've got to get to work. You're absolutely insane, you know that? Sam, Sam. Sam, open the door. What? Are you serious? No. Come on, dude. I'll get the papers in a year's time. Kunal, you were finding it difficult to tell Neha about it. But now you want to make us officially gay. Dude, we just have to sign a paper. If we're caught then we're going straight to jail. Dude, no one's going to catch us. Sam, please do this for me. I'll do anything for you, please. - Anything? - Anything. - I'll use the bathroom first in the morning. - Done. - You'll make coffee for me. - Done. - You'll introduce me to models. - Promise, I swear. Done. Awesome. You'll have to schedule... ...a fantastic photo shoot for aunty. Dude, done. Really? You're very desperate, aren't you? Ok, done. He's here! - The mayor's charity ball tonight. - I know. Morning M! Pedro Almadovar called three times. I don't care and I know. I know. M darling, you look gorgeous today. Coffee? Neha darling, only you know what I like to hear in the morning. Give me a kiss. Come. Got your mail. Speaking of males, come with me. What is this I hear? You are living with two guys, you naughty girl?! I didn't know that you had it in you. - It's really not as exciting as you think it is. Trust me. - Why? Because, as usual, both are hot, good looking, funny and sweet but... What's the problem? Both are gay. Yummy, why don't you introduce me? M, why have you received a letter from Diva? Aren't they competition? - I'm quitting this job. - What? Diva has offered me a job. As the new editor-in-chief. You're kidding, right? Why? Don't you think I can be an editor-in-chief? Oh no, no. Not at all. In fact, it's just that we'll really miss you, M. You liar. You're lying. Everybody hates me. Just waiting for me to go. So that one of you can get my chair and office. Okay, so you're right. Who's going to get this chair and office? Actually, the decision is mine. Dinner at my place. Tomorrow night. Really? Why? I'll introduce you to Sam and Kunal. I'm sure you'll love them. I'm sure I will. Are you mad? Why did you agree? She said that her boss wants to meet us and you agreed. What else could I have said? Guess what, Neha? We're not gay... We were lying only because your house is so beautiful. Come on. Seriously... Yes? A letter from the immigration office. What's written in it? I don't know. - Read it, Kunal. - Yes. - Yes. Thank you. Well... Yes, yes. They've accepted our petition. All right! Show it to me! Why is only your name on it? How's that possible? Oh, rubbish! What happened? I've written my London address in my form. - So? - So, my mother... I'm not going to do anything with any other man. I've told this to Sam earlier. Now, you hear it too. Kunal, please don't do this to me right now. My boss will be here anytime now. Sam had promised me. But I hadn't promised you. You! You had promised me. When M comes here you'd better be ready. - Good luck, brother. - Yeah? - Yeah. M darling... Neha darling! So glad that you could come. It's a candle. Oh, fabulous! I needed it so badly. Nice place. Really? You like it? Thank you so much. There... Darling, your housemaid is a fashion disaster. - Get rid of her. - No, no. M! M! M! You're... you're fired. No, no, one second. You're fired please... - Out! Out! - No, M. She's my aunt. My aunt. So sorry, aunty. What's that tied around your neck? Aunt, that's because he has a cold. Please keep this in the kitchen and the microwave buzzed. I think dinner is ready. What did you want me to do? Look at how she was dressed. No, no, it's fine. Don't worry. - Absolutely not my fault. - Please. M, this is Sam. Sam, this is M. Neha, you never told me that your boss is so hot. I like hot. One moment... Oh, Kunal... Kunal darling! That's M... the door... - Shall I get it? - I'll get it. He'll get it. So should we sit? Yes, I'd love to actually. - Well, hello! - Hello! Officer Havier from the immigration office. Didn't you get the letter? It said that someone would come by... ...for a surprise inspection. Surprise inspection? You see, a lot of people fake these things, you know. Pretend to be gay. Really? How desperate! I know. So I'm here to keep my eye on you. - Eye on me? - Well... Can I come in? Yes, sure. Sure. Sam, officer... Havier. From the immigrations office. Hi, officer! Just a second please. - Sure. - Excuse me. Hell! What do we do now? Son, now whatever is to be done he is going to do. This is not funny, okay? Yes. Well, do I look like I'm laughing? Why has he come here? To check if we're truly gay or just pretending to be. - What do you mean? - Please... please tell me what to do. Let's think. Let's just stay calm. Think. Just think like a girl. Hey, hero! Think like a girl. Not about them. What do you mean think like a girl? I mean, talk to him about his hair, his shoes. You know, this kind of thing. Think like a woman, feel like a man. - Think like a woman, feel like a man. - Feel like a man. No idiot, think like a man, feel like a... confused... come on! Okay. - Neha was telling me that you're new here. - Nice shoes. Yes, actually I'm from London and... ...I work at Howard Medical Centre. Oh... doctor. Doctor. Nurse. Nurse. My temperature is increasing. Must be the wine. Shall we have some fun? - What do you mean? - I mean, fun... Oh, my God! Why don't we play some music? Dance... I don't mind. I love dirty dancing. Let's go. Yes. - Who's that? - My mother. Mom! Oh aunty! Son, I felt I had a bad dream. Aunty, feeling better? What's all this, son? No, mom. It's just that we were playing a game... ...and it was my turn. Can I just see you outside for a second? Thank you. Come. Come. We'll be right back. Relax. Just relax. Your mother doesn't know about you, does she? How would she know, poor baby? Come to daddy. Living a lie, and that too, for others. It hurts. It really, really hurts. Till today, I haven't told... ...my mom and dad that their Murli... - Murli? - Murli... me... M... you know, darling. No! God, she's back. - Is this a house or a madhouse? - Mom! Don't you dare call me mother! Did you think even a little about my old age... Now why are you sitting in his lap. Get away from him! Let me talk to her. Let me. Don't you dare touch my son, you witch! You will have a mother's curse on you. Come back home. Come back home. Come to London with me. You were better off there. You were with girls there. Here, you are... just come back home. No, no, no. One sec, one sec, one sec. Let me talk to her. Aunty! Aunty! Look at me. Look at me. Whether it's London or Miami, your son is gay. He likes men. Wake up! Shut up! Mom! Don't listen to him, mom. He's talking nonsense. I'm not gay. You told me yourself that you are gay. He told you? No, aunty. Sam's telling the truth. There's nothing to it. He'll obviously lie. He's Sameer's boyfriend. Boyfriend? Boyfriend? Neha, you told me that they both were single. They are... Single? No, no, no. They are a couple. They applied for a residency permit together. Rascal! You dared to lie to your mother! I know everything. I received the letter. That's why I've come here. - Oh God! Grant me death! - Mom! What are you punishing me for, God? - No, mom... - This uncle with the yellow-shirt is after my child. Mom! Who is she talking to? Come on, Sam, for how long will you hide your love? I think it's time. Tell your 'Venice story' to aunty. - Venice? You went to Venice? - No, no... No, no. It's all my fault. I never kept a check on you. Had I done so, then you wouldn't be committing all these mistakes. Aunty, love isn't a mistake. Loe is blind. Isn't it? It isn't so blind that... ...it can't differentiate between a guy and a girl. Mom! Stop it, please! It's enough. I'm struck with grief. Mom, listen to me. Mom! Thank you, son. I don't want to listen to anything anymore. Mom, please... - You'll support me well... - Mom! Your son rides the bride's palanquin. Alas! You're done for! Your son rides the bride's palanquin. Alas! You're done for! Ignoring the young damsels... What is this dilemma of the heart? Ignoring the young damsels... What is this dilemma of the heart? Ignoring the young damsels... What is this dilemma of the heart? Men express fondness for men... The boy wearing the bride's gown... A mom's dream has been shattered. Mama's boy... Mama's boy has gotten spoilt. Your son rides the bride's palanquin. Alas! You're done for! Your son rides the bride's palanquin. Alas! You're done for! God knows whose evil shadow befell him. He failed to admire the shade of long tresses. - He rots in the heat. - Oh, my God! - He behaves strangely. - Oh, my God! - Somebody set him straight. - Stop him! - He's possessed! - Stop him! A pair of guys... The girls weep. There wasn't any need for them anymore. Mama's boy... Mama's boy has gotten spoilt. Your son rides the bride's palanquin. Alas! You're done for! Your son rides the bride's palanquin. Alas! You're done for! Ignoring the young damsels... What is this dilemma of the heart? Ignoring the young damsels... What is this dilemma of the heart? Men express fondness for men... The boy wearing the bride's gown... A mom's dream has been shattered. Mama's boy has gotten spoilt. Your son rides the bride's palanquin. Alas! You're done for! Your son rides the bride's palanquin. Alas! You're done for! Hello, everyone. I have an announcement to make. I've been asked to be the new editor-in-chief of Diva. So let me introduce you to your new boss... ...the new editor-in-chief of Verve. Please put your hands together and give a big warm welcome... ...to your new boss, Mr. Abhimanyu Singh. God, he's hot. Hello, everyone. I'm not very good with speeches so... ...let's just take the day off and get to know each other and... ...also bid farewell to the one and only M. Child? What happened? Did somebody say something? No, aunty. Nothing. Then are you practicing how to cry? Honestly, nothing happened. Okay, then I'll fulfill this formality by myself. Why are you crying, dear? No, I'm not crying. Something has happened for sure, dear. No, aunty. Nothing has happened. Did somebody say something to you? No. Now, tell me. I was told that I'll be given a promotion... ...and then that position was given to somebody else. You're so upset over such a small thing? I had worked so hard, you know, aunty... I had so many plans... ...they gave away the job just like that. So, things didn't happen as per your wishes. Do you know why? Because there's something better... ...in your life than this job and this position. You won't be able to see it now, but you will later. Whatever God does is for the best. I'm a mother. An expert on these issues. Cheer up, dear. I'll make nice ginger tea for you. Everything will be fine after that. Even Sam and Kunal's relationship? For the past three years, your son hid the biggest truth... ...of his life from you because he knew that you wouldn't be pleased. You'll be happy, but Sam? If he can lie for your happiness... ...then can't you accept the truth for his happiness? Whatever God does is for the best. Right, aunty? Isn't it? We'll have to redesign the magazine. - Redesign. - We'll have to present it in a completely new manner... ...and I want you to take responsibility for that. - Really? - Because I think that only you can handle this project. Okay, thanks. - And one more thing... - Yes? We'll launch our new design with our next issue. That means you only have two weeks. Two weeks?! That's not possible. I know, but if there's anyone who can do it, it's you. - Okay. I get it. - What? You didn't give me this job because you trust me. You know that I can't accomplish this task in two weeks. In fact, nobody can do it. And then you'll have a reason... ...to blame me, have me fired. Out! - What? - I've never seen such an insecure and cheap person in my life. You know what? Mr. Abhimanyu Singh... ...I will not let you win. Come. May you live long! Mom! What are you doing? Son, forgive me. I couldn't understand your love. Mom, I need to tell you something. Son, what kind of a mother am I? I prayed for my own son's sorrows. Sorry. Oh great! I had bought these bangles for my daughter-in-law. Oh, come on! Are you really serious, Mom? Honestly, I don't know whether you're my daughter-in-law... ...or my son-in-law. But whatever you are, accept it as a gift from me. And do observe a fast on 'Karva Chauth' for my son's long life. - Mom! - I'll send you the offerings. I'm leaving him in your care. I've brought him up with a lot of love and care. Take good care of him. Now hurry up and seek my blessings. Come on, Sam. Seek mom's blessings. He called me mom. You're sick! - May you live long! May you bear children. Forget it. - Okay. Thank you for bringing me close to my son. Listen to me. Find a nice guy and get married. I'd have chosen you for Sam, but he's already booked now. Sam and Kunal can never be booked for me, aunty. They will always be mine. Okay. All right, all right. - Come on, mom. - God bless you, son. - No, I was... - Don't bother. Mom, I've to talk to you. That's the problem. I agree that you're gay and... ...that you don't have any interest in girls. But can't you even see girls? What? Fool! Didn't you notice that Neha was crying? Check on her and see what's wrong. Don't worry about me. I'll go by myself. I'll call you up when I reach. God bless you! God bless... Hello! Flight's on time. Yes, yes. Come, come. Your boss said one thing right. If someone can do this job... ...then it's only you. Exactly! You just provide the ideas. He'll click the photos. - And what will you do? - I'll approve everything. At least you've smiled. - But this wasn't my plan, you know. - Plan? Yes, my plan for life. I mean, I'm 27, still single. My job sucks right now. My boss hates me and I live with two hot guys... ...who aren't interested in me at all. I mean, that was definitely not my plan. Then, what was your plan? In my plan, I'd have been the boss of the magazine by now... ...and maybe I'd even be married to someone like you That's okay, man. You had plans. Everybody does. I did as well. I planned to be an actor when I grew up. To have millions of fans who'd take pictures of me all day and night. Obviously that didn't happen. And neither does one expect them to happen Childhood dreams remain dreams. Right, Kunal? Oh, come on! No way. Are you serious? - What? - You always wanted to be a photographer? My dream came true. I can't help it. You know what, Neha? Let's go, man. Because there's no place for losers like us in his perfect life. - Lets go to that corner and cry. - Come on! - Come on! - You know, guys. You're right. I'm happy and my life is truly perfect. And that's only because I have the two of you in my life. Think about it. Had you married somebody... ...and you had been shooting at a beach in Miami... ...then how would we hae met. We three losers? And whatever said and done, this friendship is much more... ...rocking than any plan we might have had. Right? Kunal! Dude, that was really good. Group hug! Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Bye, Sam. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Listen, I hope he doesn't fire me from the job. If he does something like that, then I'll tell Kunal to break his legs. When will he put his muscles to good use, after all? Chill. It'll be okay. - Sam, love you. - Sleep well. Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord! Why is the heart so happy? Why... Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord! Where is the sky and where is the earth... I don't know. I don't know. Since my beloved arrived, I've lost control of myself.

My dreams, my heart and my breath... ...caused such a flutter... This has happened many times when I've looked at you. If you wish, this heart shall always remain yours. What else do I say? I don't know. I don't know. Where is the sky and where is the earth? I don't know. I don't know. Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord! Why is the heart so happy? Why... Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!

Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you all to meet... ...the man of the hour. Please gie a big hand to our... ...new chief editor, Mr. Abhimanyu Singh. He shall arrive in this wait... My heart floats away to the place which my dreams reveal. It feels like he's near me. Why is it so? My eyes eagerly search for him. I've lost my senses. I built my castle of dreams. When did I open my eyes... I don't know... Where is the sky and where is the earth? I don't know. I don't know. Since my beloved arrived, I've lost control of myself. I don't know...

Thank you for being here tonight. I'd like to introduce all of you to someone who is very special. Someone who's truly and entirely responsible... ...for our success tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Neha Melwani. Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord! Why is the heart so happy? Why... Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord! I'm sorry I dropped your ice cream. Okay. How about I buy you another one? - Please, please. - Alright. Okay. - What's your name? - Veer. What's your name? - My name is Neha. - Thank you. - Thank you. Here you go. - Okay, bye. I didn't know that you were married. I was. Not anymore. She left us. I'm really sorry, Abhi. I didn't realise... I had no idea. I didn't mean that she passed away - She left me for somebody else. - Oh! After Nisha left, I had to ask my mom to stay with us. At that point of time, I needed her more than Veer. But even she left us a few months back. For whom? - It's okay. - I'm sorry. - Hello! - Sam! - Hello! - Sam, guess what! I've been given a big project to shoot. - Wow! I know. I've to got go to Philadelphia for the shoot today. I'll be back tomorrow. You're leaving, - Don't go. - Sam, the food is in the fridge, tell Neha also. - Ok. I'll miss you, my jiggereypoo. - Bye, Sam. - Bye. Ya hi! Neha Melwani, please. Its a surprise, Neha. Wait for two minutes. Oh! But you can surprise me without all this too, you know Sam. Nope. - Right here. - Okay. - Ready? - Yes, please. 3, 2, 1... Wow! Surprised? Yes! Well, it's all yours. Okay. I want to give you something. So that when you're 90 years old... ...and you've lost your memory, you can't see clearly... ...you're hard of hearing and basically... ...be alone then... ...then this will be extremely useful to you. - Do you know why? - Why? Because it contains every moment, every second... ...that I've spent with my dearest friend. I call it my Sam and Neha diary. The first time you cooked for me... ...I enjoyed eating it. And then I ate something else... - Digestive pills. - Sam! - The first time we went for a walk. - I remember that. We gazed at the sunset and then at the moonlit night. By the way, you were looking very pretty that night. Sam! Our first moments of joy, moments of laughter... And then our first time in the rain. You know what? This is the most beautiful moment... ...in Sam and Neha's diary. - But here... - Smile. Sam, it's perfect. Thank you. Okay, let's go through the book. Okay. Co-chief editor, congrats. This should've happened long back. Have they just given you a promotion... - ... or will they increase your pay as well? - Of course. Here's your size, sir. Thank you. Guys, I'm just coming. Hey! I really like that. Think I should try it on? - Yes. - Ok. Neha! - Neha! - Sam! Neha, I want to tell you something. It's just that... I've been feeling Differently towards you for the last few days. Sam! Just let me speak, okay? Just one minute... Whenever I'm with you, I feel something different. Sam. I know. I know you're going to say that I'm gay. But just suppose... suppose I wasn't gay. Then... What would you have said? Sam... What'd you have said other than my name, Neha? - Sam. - Neha. Sam! What's wrong with you?! Neha?! Kunal? - You love Neha? - Yes, so? - No, you can't. - Why? Because I love Neha. Guys, what are you doing? You guys are getting out of here right now. This is so embarrassing, you know? One minute. Since when have you been in love with Neha? What do you mean since when? Is there a time limit to it? Yes, offer open only till stocks last. Exactly. And Neha is single now. So the sale is on! Hey! This isn't a 'buy one and get one free' scheme. I came here before you, so I'll tell her first. That's it. That's it. Disgusting! Disgusting behaviour! No, no. Saw that? She hates you. Yes? And if she'd heard what you had to say... ...then she'd have hated you even more and more than that... ...she'll throw us out of the house. So what, man?! Let her throw us out. I don't care. If I worry about that then I'll never be able to tell her that I love her. No you can't because no house equals no Neha. You got it? What do we do now? Hey Sam, it's Neha's birthday tomorrow. I'm planning something special for her. I know a new place, its really cool After work I'll pick her up and bring her there. Meet us there by 9 sharp. Enough is enough, Kunal. Tell me, where are we going? Nothing special. Just dinner and a movie. - Where is Sam? - Sam had some important work. Kunal! Neha! Kunal! Wow! Kunal, I mean... I must say, it's a beautiful surprise. It's fantastic. What's this? Will you have dinner with me? Sure. 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,' my favourite movie. How do you know that? Do you like it? Are you kidding? I love it. Oh it's perfect! Come, let's go. "Just like her father." What happened? No music. Hey, Kunal! What an idea! You should've seen his face. You were right. He gave a lot of pleasure to my kitty party group. This was your idea? What? What?! You think it's funny? Listen, Sam. Relax. - Relax? - Sam. Kunal! What's wrong with you guys? If there's a problem then we can talk about it. They crossed the limit last night. They were fighting. Actually, hitting each other. I mean, there's a solution to everything. What's the need to get violent? Can you... can you just say something? Please, I want to play on my Play-station. Veer. Veer! Neha, I was wondering if... actually I'm... I have invites to a party tonight and if you wish... I'd love to. Oh no! I promised Sam and Kunal... ...that I'll take them out so that they can chat... ...and sort out everything. That's okay. Bring them along. They can chat and maybe... ...the two of us as well.

I mean, if you didn't like me, then you could've told me. Why do you have to behave like this? Is this some sort of a joke? Do you think this is funny? I don't. Joke? Do you think it's a joke to get yourself waxed? Wearing these ridiculous clothes, acting like an idiot I don't think it's funny. Do you see me laughing? Do you? Forget it! Look, I'm sorry. I really want this to work and... ...I'm ready to do anything for that. I'll wear these kind of clothes, wax myself, anything. Okay? But when did I ask you to do all of this? She loves it. Hey you, bag of hair. It looks good on top, not everywhere. You're just jealous, you hairless wonder. Hey! Are you okay? Do you love each other? I didn't think so. - Neha... - How do I know this? Abhi... The two of you met him, made him do all this... Since when have you been hiding this from me? Neha, we wanted to tell you, but... But you didn't tell me, Kunal. Neha, look. Please. Forget whatever has happened. We're really sorry. Henceforth, everything will happen as per your wish. I promise. Look, we really didn't mean to upset you. It's not... How is that, Sam? How can everything be like old times? I mean, the three of us are best friends. We live in the same house. We like the same guy... I know that Abhi is attractive and when you met him in the party... ...you might've fallen for him... Now, you tell me how eerything can be just like old times. Somebody's heart will surely break... ...and that too, because of one of us. Actually, it'll be because of me. Because Abhi only likes girls. And I'm the only girl among the three of us. Sorry, keep him. I don't want him. Keep him. Why are you shouting? Shouting? I'm not shouting. Keep him. I don't want him. I'll live without him. I don't know about him. Trust me. There is no problem from my end. See, it's all good. You mean... it's okay? Really, take him. Guys, I love you. I love you guys so much. Yes. Okay. Okay, what do we do now? A hard blow in a hard way. No, I won't go to a boarding school. No, Veer. Good children don't cry. Neha and your dad have planned everything out. They'll throw you out after their wedding. No, that won't happen. My dad loves me a lot. This won't happen. He used to. He loves Neha now. Isn't it? No! Kunal, you shouldn't make children cry. What proof do you have? Proof? When your dad returns home tonight... ...you tell him that you're not well. But then Neha will call and your dad will leave you suffering... ...and go out with Neha. Then you'll know how much your dad loves you. No! Kunal, so mean. Abhi's actually very sweet. See, this is your problem. Too sweet! If you were to call him now you'd get to know all about his sweetness. Yes. He'd answer your call and say. Hello! Hi, Neha. Oh, I'm so sorry. Not today... I'm not feeling well. Shut up, guys. Why would he lie? He came to office this morning. And he was perfectly fine. See, Neha. This is your problem. You're too loyal. Is there anybody else at his home? Does he live with anybody else Mom? Sister? Father? Yes, he has a son. Anything else? Alright so he'll say his son isn't well. He doesn't need to lie to me. Neha, all guys are the same. Yes, you can bet on that. Yes, you're on. - Hello. - Hi. Hey Neha! I was missing you a lot. Let's do something exciting today. Not tonight. It's a bit difficult. Why? Are you suddenly not well? No, not me. Veer isn't feeling well. Veer? Fine. Neha! Hey! No fever. Do you want to play videogames? Yes! Naughty boy! You just said you're not feeling well? Okay, you can play videogames. But Can I go out for one hour? - No. - Just one hour. - No. - Please. - Okay. - I love you. You know, I think he is jealous of you. Of me? You know I always knew that, when I meet someone... ...I would have to fight a little for him. But with his 5 year old son I mean... ...that's really something I not thought about. I also knew that when I meet someone... ...I would have to fight for her a little bit... ...but with her 2 gay friends never thought of that. You know you very lucky that both of them are gay... ...or else the competition would be really tough. Yes, but I would've won. Really and why is that? Because I am honest, I would never lie to you or break your heart. I would change myself but neer try to change you. But most importantly, I would win because I am really good in... Abhi, I cant believe you just said that. Oh my God! Basketball match? So sweet! Kunal, this is no time to joke. I'm really serious. That's what I'm saying. It's very serious. You'll are all going out together for the first time. You, your daddy and your new mummy. Mummy? Will she shout at me?! You'll have to shout at him, Neha. If he misbehaves, then you'll have to shout at him. I can't shout at him. He's so sweet. Uncle, she won't beat me, right? I think you should give him a slap or two Are you crazy?! How can I slap a kid? Think about it, Veer. Today is the day you will hae to... ...decide what you want your future to be like. What do you mean? It's simple. Today is a trailor of what the rest of... ...your life is going to be like. Kunal, I'm really nervous. Will you and Sam Please come to the game. Don't worry, we're here for you.

Okay. Oh, my God! Thank God that you guys are here. You have no idea how stressed I am. Okay? After the two of you hung up, I got another phone call. Actually, the call was for Abhi. From a jewellery store. To tell him that the engagement ring is ready. And that it's going to be delivered here, you know. What you don't get it? He's going... ...to propose here at half-time. Nice, isn't it? You know, I'm really nervous. What do you think? Yes or no? What should I say? I really hope she says yes. I really can't make sense of it. I mean, so quickly all this. Honestly I hadn't even thought about marriage. Guys, come on. Say something. What do I say? You think I should do it? Shall I say 'yes'? Say, "no". Say "no", Neha. Please, papa. Please don't leave me. I don't like her. She's very mean. But why should I say, 'no'? Forget it. No, no, don't walk away from me. Why are you saying, "no"? Neha, let it be. What is your problem, Sam? My problem is that I'm in love with you. Both of us love you, Neha. Have you noticed nothing? Are you really that blind? Have you gone... Relax, Sam. But you both are... We're not gay. We lied to you. And we're sorry for that. We never thought that this would happen. That both of us would fall in love with you. And we can't apologise to you for that, Neha. I can't. I'm sorry. Neha, Veer... Veer, doesn't want... I'm sorry, Neha. I'm sorry. Don't Sam. Please go away from here. I don't need any of you. I don't need any of you in my life. Just get out of my house. Just go! The light is a little less bright. The rain is a little less wet. The breeze blows less often. Desires are less in life. Time has stopped such that... ...it seems as if it waits for you. Why does my every breath seem to be crying? Why do I seem to have befriended loneliness? I don't know what this is. Every morning seems to be a dark night. The light is a little less bright. The rain is a little less wet. Time has stopped such that... ...it seems as if it waits for you. Case no. E9147463, petition for same sex residency, Congrats from today, you are officially gay.
