Let go! I'm not gonna hurt you. Relax. Oh, God. Please, please, please let me go! Get back, coppers. - Take it easy. - I mean it. One more step and she's gonna end on the floor with the rest of them. - You don't mean that. - Easy, now. You don't want to hurt that girl. Let's talk about this. Come on. Put the knife down. Manuel Cass, you have been found to have been legally insane at the time of your crimes. Therefore, I commit you to be confined to a state mental hospital until your sanity has been restored. - Oh, Ken. - Hi, sweetheart. How are you? I'm so glad you're here. What's wrong? What's all this? Come on in. We'll talk about it. Are you okay? They haven't come out of that laboratory for the last three days. They won't answer when I knock. Ken, I don't know what I'm gonna do. Linda, you've been married six months now, and you sound like a woman who's been married for ten years. It's those experiments of his. They just mean more to him than I do. Come on, now. You know that isn't true. Now, Roger had one heck of a jolt after that breakdown, honey. Yes, I know. That was cruel, the way the hospital wouldn't let him return to the staff. Ken, he's driving himself right into another breakdown, and I don't want to be around when it happens. I'll go in and talk to him, all right? I can do something. Roger, it's me... Ken. - Ken? - Yeah. Hey, Doctor. How are ya? How ya doin'? This is really quite a setup. Thanks. Hey, Rog, you know you got Linda all shook up? That's why she called me out here if you wanna know why I'm here. Why don't you go out and talk to her, let her know you're alive? - I can't. - Why not? Come here. - What do you think? - It's remarkable. How long's it been since you operated? Three days. And I haven't been able to leave his side. Let me show you something. Come here. See this snake here? This was our first successful experiment. It's amazing. What's your next step? Is to take the live head of an animal and replace it completely with the other live animal's head. And after that? Then humans. When I am successful with this operation... then I'll be able to do it. Well, Roger, what happens to the person whose head you've removed? You can't keep the body alive, can you? No. But supposing somebody has irreparable brain damage, can't ever be cured, is absolutely incurable, can't ever lead a normal life again. Rog, they're a human being. You don't think that he'd be better off? Say you perfect the operation. Who's going to judge who should live and who should die? The future generation. Then we could have a society that takes a man's life on the pretext of humanity. Roger, the white blood count is the same as yesterday. Thank you. Excuse me. Kenny, this is Dr. Cooper. Doctor, how are you? How do you do? If you'll excuse me, I have more tests to run. I'll take that, Roger. Thank you. I don't want to get into a discussion of ethics about all of this, but you have another problem. - What's that? - Linda. - What about her? - I think she's gonna leave you. Now, what makes you think that? Why don't you come out and talk to her? I'll tell ya what. I got one more test here. It'll take about four minutes to run it. Good. Then I can tell her you're coming out. Wait a second. Do me a favor. Look, anything that you've seen here or anything that we've talked about is just between you and I, okay? Of course. Roger, can you trust him? Max, look, you've got to relax now. That is the primary thing... you've got to relax. The man is my best friend. I went to college with him. He was my closest colleague at the hospital. There's no problem with him. Pull! Come on! Giddyup! Pull. Come on. Come on! Come on. Pull. Come on! Come on! Giddyup! Come on, you horses. Giddyup! Pull hard. Come on! Get that old tree. Well, Dan, I guess the old boys just can't do it anymore. Let me help, Daddy. Please? Please? Please, Daddy? Go back there and see what you can do. Go on. Giddyup! Come on! Come on! Giddyup! Come on, pull, you critter! Pull! Pull! Come on! Giddyup. Come on! Come on! Giddyup! Giddyup! It's coming! I knew I could do it, Daddy. You sure did. I did it, Daddy. I've got to really get back. I'll see you. Danny? What are you doing at this time of night? - And with that ax? - Give me the ax. Come on. Give it to me. That's right. Does your father know you're here? Now, this is an ax... and it is used to chop wood, correct? Correct? And nothing else. Okay, now, you go on home. Yes, Mr. Roger. - I'm sorry about that. - It's okay. Ken, I'm sorry. He only has the mentality of about an eight-year-old. Really? He was trapped in a mine cave-in when he was young not very far from here. When they finally reached him, he'd suffered irreparable brain damage from lack of oxygen. He still holds a morbid fascination for that cave. It's a good thing he's got you to take care of him. Danny's just like family to us. Well, I've got to get back, and I want to thank you. - Don't be a stranger. - I won't, I promise you. Next time I'll come back... it'll be about a month... - I'll come back and stay with you. - Please do. And you, take care of her, will ya? - I mean it. - I will. I'll be curious to know about your little pets, too, see their progress. Good-bye. Yeah. Feeling good now, aren't you? Got some rest? Feel a little chipper today. Thirty days already, and you're still doing real fine, aren't ya? You've done an amazing job, Roger. I think maybe we're ready for the next step, wouldn't you say so? What? If you're ever to be recognized for your abilities, you have to be prepared to take chances. Ten years ago, these hands were skilled and confident as yours are now. Only you can give me back those hands... and the body needed to go with them. Miss Linda. - Let me help, Miss Linda. - Sure, Danny. Come on. Danny, you get back to chopping that wood. I can do it later. Never you mind. You get back to your chores. You'd better go now. You can help me after you've finished. Okay, if you say so. Go on. I feel so sorry for him. Isn't there anything that can be done? Well, maybe after my next experiment. Roger, could we go away someplace? Just the two of us? We could go to that lodge where we spent our honeymoon. Really, the change would do us both good. It sounds like it would be very nice. The only problem is, what about my work? What do you want me to do about my work? Come quickly! The monkey! We lost him. I wonder what could have happened. It could have been heart failure. We better start the autopsy right now. All right. Max, come here and look at this. See that right there? But it looks like the coronary artery... is occluded completely around the heart. Well, then the transplant had nothing to do with its death. Poor monkey. Do you know that if this little guy had been healthy... he'd still be alive? Maybe the next one can be... Why are those experiments so important? Do you remember what they did to me at the hospital? Yes. Is that going to come between us the rest of our lives? Honey, come on. Don't you understand what it is I'm trying to do? That I'm trying to show those doctors, those antiquated old men, that I am really doing something with my life?! That I am giving something of myself to other people?! Roger, you're a fine surgeon and you could have a marvelous practice. Honey, you don't understand what I'm saying to you. I don't want to be like my father. The only thing that made him happy in his life was collecting money. I don't want to be like that. I want to do something with my life. I want to give something of myself to science. I have a chance to help mankind. I have a chance to have my name go down with all the other great scientists. But what am I supposed to do when you lock yourself away for 24 hours a day? I'll make a deal with you. I'll make a deal with you. If you let me go on with what I'm doing just a little while longer and be patient, then your old pal Roger will take you away anyplace you want to go. But you've said that before. But you know what happened before. I didn't mean it. Look at me. And now I mean it. Come on. All persons are warned to be on the lookout for Manuel Cass, who this morning escaped from the Camarillo State Mental Hospital in a stolen 1961 white Comet. Cass is extremely dangerous and may be armed. He is male, Caucasian, age 32, hair and eyes... brown, height... 5'10", weight... 160 pounds. The police warn, if seen, notify your nearest local law enforcement agency immediately. We now return you to the Dave Hull Show. - Andrew? - Yes, Miss Linda. - Where's Danny? - He's on the grounds somewhere. Has Max come back from town yet? Would you let me know just as soon as he does? I'll be right here by the pool. - Yes, Miss Linda. - Thanks, Andrew. Come on, let's go! Olly, olly, oxen free! Hey, Danny. Come on, Danny. Roger! Roger! Please. Please. Put your hands against the wall. Feet out. Yeah. Legs out. Baby, let's go for a ride. Miss Linda? Danny, in here! - Danny, untie me. - Dr. Roger. Untie me. Daddy? Talk to me, Daddy. Talk to me. Danny, untie me so that I can help your daddy. I'm coming as quickly as I can. Cass is believed headed for the Sunnyville area of northern California. There, two years ago, he brutally slayed nine men and women. Caution... this man is extremely dangerous. The police warn, if seen, notify your nearest local law enforcement... - Kiss me. - No. Are you all right? Give me a hand here, Roger. Now be careful. I don't want to hurt him any worse than he is. Max, you drive around back. I'll be there in a second. - Honey. Come on. - ...for Christmas. You said we could, Daddy. You said we could. Now, you're gonna take this and you're gonna get some sleep. Roger, help poor Danny. I will. You just take this. - Please help him. - I will. Don't worry. Drink some water. Okay? Did it go down? Now you just try and get some sleep and I'll be back in a little while. Okay? Everything's okay. We can still go. You said we could. Danny, you can't do anything more for him. Now, come on. I want to stay with my daddy. - Danny, come on. - No. Let go! We're gonna have to get Danny away from his dad. I'm sure the death has completely unbalanced him. Come on. Come on, Max. Come on, Max, grab his arm! Daddy! Daddy! He'll be going any minute now. There's nothing more we can do. - Sometimes we're so helpless. - You're wrong, Roger. Don't you realize we have here two perfect subjects? One a retarded man who's of no use to himself or to anyone else, and here a homicidal maniac who'll be dead in a few minutes anyway. You're not gonna do that to Danny. Roger, such an opportunity may never come again. I don't know. I'd appreciate it if you and Linda would kind of look after Danny for me. He's going now. He's legally dead. All right. Go ahead and start the heart pump. It's done. May God forgive us. It's okay. They'll be asleep for a few days now. Yes. I know. There's one more thing we have to do before tomorrow morning. - Are you okay? - I'm all right. Did the sheriff come? How about that man? The man died of his wound. And the sheriff was here, and I told him that you were resting, and he told me that my statement would be enough. How is poor Danny? Well, honey... - Danny ran away. - Ran away? We've gotta find him. No, because he's done it before. He's done it before. Now, I went ahead and sent Max into town, and he's arranging for a decent burial for Andrew. Pulse is okay. Blood pressure's okay. - What about the blood count? - It's okay, too. Normal? Well, it's six days... and I would say that our experiment was a definite success. Telephone. I can't come to the phone now. Find out who it is. I'll call him back. It's Ken. All right. Tell him I'll be right there. He'll be here in just a minute, Ken. Yeah. How are ya? Fine, fine. I'm all right. Hey, listen, my vacation starts this weekend. Right. You still want a houseguest? Yeah, that'd be great. We'll expect you this Saturday. And I got something really fantastic to show you. Yeah. Okay. Bye. I'm glad he's coming. Maybe he can keep you out of that lab for a while. Maybe. Roger, I'm worried. - Danny hasn't come home yet. - Honey, don't worry about Danny. I know. But just the same, we should phone. I just told you not to worry about Danny. If he's not back in a couple days, I'll phone the sheriff. It's waking! No, it's all right. Just lay down. Three CCs of Demerol. Come on. No, you're all right. You're all right. Stay relaxed. Relax. - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right! - What's going on in there? - Nothing, darling. Just go on back. It's okay, it's okay. I'll take that. All right? Yeah, they're okay. Daddy? Well, what do you know? It can talk. - Who are you? - I'm your brother. - I don't have a brother. - You do now. I don't like it any better. Until we can do something about it, I'm running this monster, understand? My neck hurts. Our neck hurts, stupid. Don't you see what these maniacs have done to us? Stop jerking around. You and I are now one, dummy. Let's stand up. I'll show you. I've got to teach the moron to walk. Left, right. Left, right. Left, right. Now you've got it. Not bad. Look at Uncle Cass now, girls. Let's get out of this thing. Don't make a sound. Oh, no! No! Stop! Danny! Get back there on that table. Here, Roger. Here. Sniff. Sniff. No, no, it's all over, baby. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Didn't I tell you not to come down here to the lab? Get up and go on back to bed. We've got to go phone the sheriff. I don't need to call the sheriff. Nothing's wrong. If you won't call them, then I will. I'm gonna lock you up in here for your own good. Roger, please. Please let me talk to you. Come on, now. - Jerry, there's somebody out there. - No, there's nobody out there. Listen. Come on, relax. Nobody's out there. Jerry, I can't help hearing something. Would I lie to you? Now, if you don't stop it, Tom, I'm gonna walk home. I'll be good. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! No. No. Sheriff, they still stick to that story about a giant with two heads. I don't know what them fool kids seen, but there ain't a such animal. Who could have feet that big? Offhand, there's only one person that I know of. That's Andrew Norton's boy Danny. Yeah, but he ain't never hurt nobody. No. Let's check him out anyway. Roger, we've got to find him before he's discovered. Yeah, I know. Here. I'll take your rifle. As soon as I see about Linda, we'll go back out after him. How could you have done such a thing? Roger! Somebody's coming! No. You just stay here. Come on, Max! Come here. Keep her in here. Lock the door. Stay still! - Morning, Doc. - Sheriff. There's something I'd like to talk to you about. May I come in? - What seems to be the problem? - I'd like to speak with Danny. Yeah, come on in. What about Danny? Well, a young couple was murdered not too far from here last night, and from the size of the footprints found in the area, they could have been Danny's. I don't think so, Sheriff. Danny and Andrew left here last Thursday. Left? Where'd they go? Well, Andrew told me he'd gotten a better job offer in Middletown. That's funny. I didn't think they'd ever leave. Andrew's been caretaker here ever since your father built this place. Well, I'd Still like to talk With Danny. You wouldn't happen to know the name of Andrew's new employer, would you? Gee, I sure don't. I'm sorry. Well, maybe Mrs. Gerard would know. Boy, you really hit us on a bad week because she went off to visit her relatives at the end of last week. I've got an assistant Max. I don't think you've met him. He rumbles around like a little kid knocking things over. Maybe he'd know about Danny and Andrew. No, Sheriff, I'll tell ya what. Max... I don't think so. He's one of those people that likes to really be by himself a lot. Just the same, if you don't mind, I'd still like to talk with him. Well, I'll call him for you, Sheriff. Come on out. The sheriff would like to speak to you for a second. I'll be right there. I'm sorry I can't be of more help, Sheriff. Well, thanks anyway. Guess I'll be on my way, so you two can get back to your work. I'll let you know if I hear anything about Danny. Thanks, Doc. You bitch! Look what she's done. - Hold her still. - No! No! This is for your own good. Not a bad hideout. Sometimes I think you even have brains. Will my daddy get better soon? He'll get better. When can I see him? I told you to stop asking me all those stupid questions. He told me to take care of you until he got better, and that means you're supposed to listen to me, right? Okay. Let's go find something to eat. I'm hungry, imbecile. What a mess. Hi, Rog. Here I am, just like I promised. Don't look so surprised. It's only me. I'm right in the middle of a very important experiment right now and I just don't have time to show you around. - Let me in. - I'm very busy right now, Ken. - Rog, you all right? - I'm fine, but I'm very busy. - Now, please go back to the city. - What's the matter? He's gone. We can start looking again. Get the guns. Man, am I stoned! Turk, come on. Get up. Let's go back to that hick town and really shake it, man. Yeah, baby! Man, we would blow their minds. Maybe, man. Maybe. Turk, this food's ready, and if you're not here to eat it, that's tough. I'm going, Turk. You coming? No. You go ahead, baby. I'd rather eat than hassle. I guess I can take a little ride and clear my skull. Come and get it. Say, fill 'er up? - You just passing through? - Yep. I thought maybe you was another reporter or something. Reporter? Why? A young couple was killed up there on the loop last night. - Check the hood? - No, that's all right. A couple of kids claim they saw a giant with two heads do it. - Did you say two heads? - Yeah. I sure wish I had some of what they were smoking. - That'll be four and a quarter. - Keep the change. - Where's the sheriff's office? - It's down the road a piece. Wait a minute! Don't you want your stamps? Sheriff? Yeah, what is it? I'm Dr. Anderson, a friend of Dr. Gerard's. - Can I talk to you? - Make it fast. There's been a couple of murders reported outside of town. - Another one? - That's right. Maybe you could be of some help. Would you like to come along? - Yeah. - Follow me in your car. What do you make of it, Doc? Practically every bone in her body is broken. The man who did this must have had fantastic strength. Yep. Those other two weren't much better off. Do you have any ideas? Me? I think it's the work of that maniac who escaped from the state mental hospital last week. What makes you say that? Well, they found his car down in the ravine. No sign of him, so he must still be in the area. Some men are beginning to assemble on the other side of the road, and Ben Taylor's on his way with the dogs. We're gonna run ourselves down a murderer. Care to join us? No, I've got to run some things down myself. Go ahead. Well, thanks for the help. You know we're gonna have to destroy him. Can't we find him first? See what the trouble is? Well, we owe him that much. It's just, without morphine, the pain is just gonna really... Ben and Sam will lead off with the hounds. Now, if anybody sees him, don't go taking off after him by yourself. Let the rest of us know about it. You got that? Right. - Okay, let's go. - Come on, let's go. He seems to be wandering aimlessly. The steps seem to lead in the direction of that hill. From up there, we can see the whole area. Yes. That's quite a story. You know, it's hard to believe that Roger would... Look, my car's out front, honey. You change, okay? We'll go find the sheriff. I'll be out in the hall. Hurry up. Roger, look! Come on. We've got to get back there right now. Ken, what will happen to Roger? He won't be blamed, will he? You couldn't stay away, could you? Rog, look, I think it's gone far enough, man. Let's call the sheriff. He's gonna find out. Let's put an end to the whole thing. I'm not calling anybody, my friend. The sheriff's not gonna find out until I want him to. Then maybe everybody will understand and appreciate exactly what it is I've been trying to do. Linda, shut up. Max, take her to the lab. Wait a minute. Now, you just stand right there. You're gonna come with us, Kenny, and you're gonna see exactly what it is we've been doing. Rog, what you've done has already killed five people. What? Come on, let's call the sheriff. He can help us put a stop to it. Well, we've lost him. We'll have to split up. Half of you go back downstream, the other half upstream. If either of us finds him, fire two shots, wait for the others. Let's go. Look! He's headed back toward the house. He's heading toward the Gerard estate. That could be it. This is the way to the old mine. Man. Dr. Gerard must have been brewing some of that Jekyll and Hyde joy juice in here. At least we haven't found any more bodies. There's nobody in the house. - The dogs picked up the scent. - Let's go. Please help me, Danny. I can't, Miss Linda. No, I can't. - Shoot. - No, Roger. You promised we'd try to take him alive. - What are you waiting for? Shoot. - No. Don't shoot. Drop that rifle. I'm sorry, Roger. If Danny's body dies, I may never get another one. All right, then. You grab that net and go around the side and throw it over him. - Listen. - Just take care of Linda. - Come on, Rog. - Just take care of Linda. - What about you? - Don't worry about me. It's okay. I've got him! I've got him! I've got him! Get back! Come on, quick! Before it's too late! Come on! We can't! We can't go back now! Are you all right? Yes, I'm... Roger! We're gonna have to tell them. Do we? Is that how we want Roger to be remembered? Are you two all right? Yes. Thanks. Was the killer in there? Yep. Who was it? It was Danny. Oh, God. Where's Dr. Gerard? I'm sorry. Sorry, Linda. Doc. Is there anything to that story about that two-headed man stuff? Sometimes too much imagination can... can destroy a man, Deputy.
