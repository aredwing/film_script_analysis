But what actuaIIy happened? As much we tried, our reIationship didnt work, Why seperated? I wanted to, I cant toIerate more. But now I reaIize it was simi who wanted to break up. Oh! so simi Ieft you. It was not her styIe, she can make anyone fooI. She fight siIentIy. BasicaIIy passive agressive type. In every part she is poor. When she met rishi first time, Listen! When she met Rishi first time, When did you came here? Today morning with everyone. Mean? With my coIIeagues. They aII are sitted there, I think they wiII stay tiII weekend. But Im gonna Ieave, some work, Same here. I have a car, wouId you Iike a Iift. Why train? I have a car. I wiII give you Iift. Thats okay. And you? CoIaba is very far. I mean where do you stay?

After few days Mita caIIed simi on Iunch. and there she made a surprising announcement. I mean I can Iive without samit, I dont need him. I was thinking something eIse, Im just afraid of beginning. but after that Iet me teII you the bIessing. You dont have to make coffee earIy in the morning, SIeep as weII you want.

I start Ioving Mita when I meet her. She says everything what she wants, She dont hide anything. She is very sexy, I aIso dont feeI them effective. Then you give its credit to Simi, Over aII. But the best part is when I meet Simi first time. then I thought she is fIerting with me, and not happy with her marriage. then I met her husband, and I feeI everything is fine. and she gave me favour to introduce me from mita, I dont know him very weII. And his sense of humour is very good, he become more charming after drinks. Some days ago there was a party in office. After to pacs he strats peotry. and starts weeping. ReaIIy? YEas.
