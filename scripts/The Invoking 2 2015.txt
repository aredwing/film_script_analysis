Come on. Hey, Jesus, girl. You all right? You're all wet. Where you going? Uh, yeah, okay, me too, me too. (BABY MURMURING) You got a baby there? Is it a boy or a girl? Nice, I guess you're not really the talkative type, huh? - It's okay, let me put on some tunes, huh? - (TUNING RADIO) - What's wrong with the radio? - (TURNS RADIO OFF) Looks like... whoa, looks like there's an accident up ahead. Wait here, I gotta see if everybody's okay. - God, looks like... this looks bad. - (SQUELCHING) Hey, hello? Aw, man. Hey, hello? Hey, you okay? Miss? (UNDER HIS BREATH) Shit. Hey, miss, you okay? Miss? Oh, God. (BABY GROANING) (BABY SCREAMING) (TIRES SCREECHING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTERING) What do we got? Well, we got three dead. Looks like car one side-swiped car two. Car two hits the pole, sends this woman out the window, baby follows. Baby? Jesus. Yeah, and the weird thing is, car one guy actually seems to have gone off - and then come back a little bit later. - Hope it wasn't to apologize. So he finds her and then gets hit by a third car. POLICE OFFICER: We got a lead on that? (DOG BARKING) - (KEYS JINGLING) - (SARAH SIGHS) SARAH: I can never remember which one it is. CHAD: You must be in charge of a lot of doors. SARAH: (LAUGHING) Yeah. Ah, here we go. - CHAD: Finally. - (DOOR UNLOCKING AND OPENING) (SLAMMING) (SIGHS) Okay. SARAH: Sorry we had to use the back door. The only one that hasn't been condemned. That's okay. I'm just glad you could show me the place. Well, follow me. Watch your step there, please. (RAT SQUEAKING) - SARAH: We'll just continue through here. - CHAD: Okay. Okay, so this is it. The crown-jewel of Wayville Hill. Uh, built in 1827. Just five years before the cholera epidemic of 1832. (SLAMMING) - It's charming. - Yeah. So, of course, the power is off. So is the heat. The city just can't afford to keep the boilers running. But we can turn that all back on for you, if you choose to use this in your movie. Yeah, no worries. I like it just the way it is. Good. Okay, well, we should get going. If you'll just come with me. Each nurse would be in charge of one floor to herself. She'd have one or two people below her to help out. But that way, it kept things nice and consistent for everyone. CHAD: This place is huge. SARAH: Yeah, three wards, 500,000 square feet. And enough equipment to treat hundreds of sick patients. CHAD: It doesn't look that old, for something built almost 200 years ago. SARAH: Well, the building has gradually been renovated over the years. I mean up until the county closed it, 32 years ago. We're gonna go in here. And what happened here? Nothing you didn't show in your movies, Mr. Winchester. - CHAD: Oh, so you're familiar with my work? - Yeah, a little bit. Got guts. (CHUCKLES) (SLAMMING) SARAH: You know, this institution helped a lot of people. CHAD: I heard they weren't always that helpful here. SARAH: Yeah, well, it's like my dad used to always say, "You can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs." CHAD: Yeah, I guess. Oh, yeah! Welcome to the asylum. I'm just gonna get some video footage here, okay? SARAH: Yeah. Yeah. CHAD: Okay, let's do this. Hello to my future self, to the producers watching this with me. Hello. Oh, hi, Mom. (CHUCKLES) I'm standing in one of the freakiest places I've seen in a very long time. Wayville Hill Sanitarium, West Virginia. Well, fortunately not everything is so depressing down here. (LAUGHING) Hey, it's grandma's upholstery. So according to a friend of a friend of mine who lives in the county, Wayville Hill Sanitarium became infamous for its atrocious experiments conducted on the patients, between around 1925 to 1928. The most popular case is the one of a Mary Weaver. It's even said that Mary's ghost still roams these corridors searching for something. (LAUGHING) Classic. Here she is. SARAH: Come on, it's this way. So... according to the medical archives, Mary was in room 502... which should be at the end of this corridor. Ah, here it is. Oh, this is great. (LAUGHING) Oh, wow! Oh, my God. Even the cheesiest horror flick wouldn't have something this obvious. Oh, this is good stuff. - Did you do this for me? - SARAH: Don't flatter yourself. - CHAD: Here, give me a hand with this. - SARAH: Okay. (EERIE BREATHING) (BUMPING) Well, that sucks. Well, I don't know what you were hoping for. I don't know, something sexier. Can you introduce yourself to the camera? Hi, I'm Sarah Davis. I work for the county of Tucker, West Virginia. CHAD: Tell us where we are. We are in room 502 of Wayville Hill Sanitarium. Can you explain to the people watching this why I so very badly wanted to come here? Because of the story of Mary Weaver. CHAD: And what is that? Back in 1927, the body of nurse Mary Weaver was found dead in this room, laying in a pool of her own blood. It's said that she committed suicide after a psychotic breakdown, following the murder of her baby. After she became pregnant, she was admitted to this hospital for anxiety. The doctor in charge believed her unborn baby was the devil. So immediately upon giving birth, he slit the baby's throat as she watched helplessly. He didn't even bother to cut the umbilical cord first. She completely lost it, and was locked in this room, to rot and die. It's said that she just rocked back and forth, begging for them to give her baby back. One night, she managed to break the window, and using a shard of glass, she disemboweled herself completely. CHAD: Cut. Damn, you're good. That was good. What about the other rooms? Yes, well, the infirmary is down the hall. I'm in. (EERIE BREATHING) CHAD: So, is it true that if you listen closely, sometimes you can hear her hum songs to her dead kid? (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) SARAH: Well, yeah, that's part of the folklore of this place. But mainly it's just scary stories, told to frighten little kids. CHAD: Well, that's a shame. Maybe if we're lucky, we'll get a chance to hear something. (CHAD HUMMING) Mary? Mary? Oh, look at that. That's a creepy shot. (CHAD HUMMING) MARY: (WHISPERING) Sarah. - CHAD: Hey, I think I found it. - (GASPING) God! CHAD: (LAUGHING) What? Come on. Follow me. SARAH: Okay. (WHEELCHAIR SQUEAKING) - (RATS SQUEAKING) - (DRIPPING) CHAD: Now this is more like it. Do you think this is where the doctor killed that baby? SARAH: Maybe. If I remember correctly, this is the only place in the sanitarium where a woman could give birth. You know a lot about this place, huh? Yeah, my father used to bring me here a lot, as a child. You know, before they closed it down. Really? He worked here? Like his father and grandfather before him. - I am the only one that didn't go... - (GLASS CRUNCHING) ...into medicine. So, would your great grandfather have been here during the Mary events? SARAH: Yeah, I guess. I've never really given it much thought. That's my great grandfather. It looks like he's the only doctor in all these photos. Yeah, that's because he was the only doctor. The county couldn't afford any more. Shit. So the doctor that killed Mary's baby would have been... - My great grandfather. - (SCREAMING) (EERIE BREATHING) That was not a hum! What the fuck? That was not a fucking hum! - We need to leave. We need to leave, now! - (SLAMMING) What the fuck was that? Who's there? (EERIE WHISPERING) I said who's there! Oh, shit. MARY: (WHISPERING) My baby. CHAD: You gotta be fucking kidding me. (SCREAMING) Fuck, come on. Why won't this open? (GROWLING) MARY: (WHISPERING) Sarah. - (GROWLING) - (GASPS) (MARY WHISPERING) No, what do you want from me? (CRYING) Leave me alone. (TINKLING MUSIC PLAYS) (MARY HUMMING) (EERIE BREATHING) (WHISPERING) Give me back my baby. (DRIPPING) SARAH: Chad? Chad? (WHIMPERS) (CRYING) Oh, my God. MARY: (WHISPERING) Sarah. My baby. Sarah. (SARAH SCREAMING) MARY: (WHISPERING) My baby. My baby. Sarah. (SARAH SCREAMING) Give me back my baby. (MARY HUMMING) I want my baby. (YELLING) Give me back my baby! (SLAMMING) (GURGLING) (SCREAMING) MAN ON PHONE: I don't like this, Erin. I'm coming home. ERIN: I'm fine. We knew this was gonna happen sooner or later. It's fine. Even if you rented a car and drove, you wouldn't be here until tomorrow morning. - MAN: Let me call Kelly, she'll at least... - I don't need a babysitter. I'm fine. Look... I haven't heard from them in a long time. I'm sure there not just gonna suddenly show up because you're not here. I'm safe. I'm inside. I'll just lock the doors and be just fine. MAN: Will you promise me you'll take at least one? Yes. (DEEP BREATH) (DEEP BREATH) (BEEPING) (WATER RUNNING) TV: Tell me I'm stupid and pathetic and just leave me alone. TV: They've investigated my mother. Thank God she's dead. TV: Those are really... TV: They have writing samples... (THUDDING) (BANGING) (WATER STOPS RUNNING) (FLOORBOARDS CREAKING) (FLOORBOARDS CREAKING) (WATER RUNNING) - (BANGING) - (FLOOR CREAKING) (PHONE RINGING) APPARITION: Put it down. You know they can't help you. OPERATOR: 911, what's your emergency? APPARITION: They'll only put you away again. OPERATOR: Hello? Hello, is anybody there? Sorry, wrong number. APPARITION: It's been a while. Do you miss us? Why can't you just leave me alone? APPARITION: (CHILD'S VOICE) We're a part of you. We always will be. I don't need you anymore. APPARITION: You've always needed us. You're nothing without us. I'm not listening to you. You're not here. Go away.

No, I'm fine. We can give you a wake-up call in the morning if you want one. No, I'm fine. CLERK: Okay, well, enjoy your stay at Sleep Well Hotel. - Thank you. - CLERK: Bye bye. TV: During what can only be described as a crime of passion and jealousy. Police describe the scene as tragic and frantic. Police in Wichita are looking for this man, Mr. Philip Davenport, age 31. He's believed to be at large in the Metro area. And he's wanted in connection with the deaths of at least 12 women. - (KNOCKING) - Police are urging anyone with information on his whereabouts to please call Crime Stoppers at... - Hello? - (KNOCKING AT DOOR) No, thank you. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) I said, no, thank you. (POLICE SIREN) COP: Get down on the ground! Now! Get down! (YELLING) (KNOCKING) Shit. Who is it? I told you I didn't want room service. All right? The sign says do not disturb. Do you speak English? I'm trying to get some sleep in here. - CLERK: Front desk. - Yeah, I wanna make a complaint. CLERK: Okay, sir, what's your concern? My concern is your housekeeper keeps knocking on my door. All right? I told you not to send anyone. I am trying to sleep. CLERK: Sir, all the housekeepers left a few minutes ago. It's probably just a kid from one of the rooms next to yours. There's a policeman on-site, I could send him over? No, no. Look, it's fine. Thanks. Look, I just wanna get some rest. CLERK: All right, good night, sir. (KNOCKING) PHILIP: Hello? Who is it? Please, please leave me alone. I just wanna be left alone. No way. I'm not in the mood for tricks. Who are you? I couldn't control myself, all right? There's nothing good about what I do. I do it because I have to. It was you. You must have killed the others. The police said there were 12. I only killed seven. You're just a copycat. Trying to take credit for my work. I don't take pleasure in killing. I just let things get out of hand. I bet you do it for enjoyment, don't you? All right... if you must know. I do enjoy it a little. Not as much as you, I bet. Not even close. Who are you? How do you know me? Just leave me alone! (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - (GUNSHOTS) - (THUDDING) Shit.

I guess I'm not sure. - Do you want to talk about it? - What's there to talk about? Look, I'm sorry. I just... I guess I don't know how to talk about it yet. I don't know how I feel, you know? I want to have a good time, really. That's the point, right? Listen... maybe we shouldn't have come up here so soon after... No, it'll be great. I'll adjust, okay? Thank you. For what? For being you.

Scare you? - No. Towel? - Yes, please. Thank you. You look tired. I didn't get much sleep. A lot on your mind? There was something in the walls last night. It was scratching. Raccoon? I'm not sure. Maybe. No one's really been up here to care for the place. Well, you want me to take a look? - Sure. - Where'd you hear it? - CARISSA: It's in the bedroom. - Okay. (KNOCKING) Well, I don't see anything. - You didn't hear anything? - No. You have a ladder? Maybe it's in the attic. Yeah. DEREK: So it's like, it folds out, right? How does it... (LAUGHING) Well, there's your problem, Riss. Isn't that a bat house? How long has that been there? You okay? What? CARISSA: Don't you think they're kind of all over each other? Are you kidding? It'd be the same if it was us. That doesn't make you worry? Riss, okay... Look, I know you've been kind of messed up lately, dealing with a lot of stuff. But that... that guy, there... that is something you don't have to worry about. - Okay? - You're right. - Yeah. - You're always right. - You always know how to make me feel better. - Yes, I do. You know what? I think it's grilling time. Mm-hmm. (STRUMMING GUITAR) This reminds me of freshman year. You guys remember that? How could I forget? June 22nd, Bobby Mitchell's... Hey, isn't that the first time you guys... - You told him? Jerk! - Yes, of course I told him. It was high school. And like you didn't tell Riss. Riss? Sorry, what was that? - It's nothing. - I don't think we were friends then. - I think I'm gonna go lay down for a bit. - Yeah. - You okay? - I'm tired. It's getting late. - I'll go with you. - No, stay. Have fun. - Are you sure? - Yes, now have a good time. I'll be better tomorrow. She's been acting really strange lately. Do you guys think she's gonna try something? Jess, please! Give her some more credit than that. What is your problem? Nothing. TRISTAN: Guys, she's fine. She's just... going through a bit of a bad spot right now. I gotta give her her meds in like a half hour. So... I'll check on her then. Man, she's lucky to have you. Shit, I would be lucky to have you. TRISTAN: More for us. (SCRATCHING) Stupid fucking bats. I'll never sleep. TRISTAN: Hey. Do you hear that? Bats in the wall, they just keep scratching. - There's... - Shh! Listen. There's nothing here. I swear they were there. You must have scared them off. Why are you back so soon? I came to give you your meds. I can do it myself, you know. I'm okay now, really. I appreciate all you're doing for me, but you can't treat me like a child. Yeah, yeah. You're right, I... Sorry. Okay? I do trust you. Here. Hey, get some sleep. All right? I'll make us breakfast in the morning. Okay, I love you. TRISTAN: I love you, too. (SCRATCHING) Carissa? What are you doing? (SCRATCHING STOPS) (CARISSA SIGHS) I had a nightmare. I must have panicked. TRISTAN: What are you doing with your pills? It was the scratching. It started again. I panicked. (SCRATCHING) (SCREAMING) - (JESS SCREAMING) - Hey, I got you something! Morning, sunshine. It's breakfast. He's a trophy is what he is. - I'm gonna smell like fish all fucking day. - DEREK: Morning, riss. - Morning. - DEREK: How'd you sleep? What do you think? This is... this is Lance. - Lance bass. - (LAUGHING) (GUYS CHATTERING) TRISTAN: I think it's the same thing. DEREK: I am taking a piss, so, be right back. Babe, you should probably take your meds. Can you stop doing that? I thought we talked about this. It's just that you scared me yesterday. I didn't know how many you took. - Why? What happened? - Are you serious, Tristan? I took one, okay? I'm sorry I didn't ask your permission first. Whoa, didn't mean to piss you off. - You've been acting weird all weekend. - Me? You've got to be joking. After what I just came out of? Yeah, so I overdosed. And now I feel like all you've done is babysit me. Like you've all put me under a microscope. Well, you have been acting kind of strange lately. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I not perky enough for you? You've been looking at me like I'm some sort of psycho! Oh, do you think she might try something? - I didn't think you could hear me. - CARISSA: Well, sweetheart, I did. And I've noticed how you've been all over my boyfriend this weekend, you fucking whore! Bitch! Are you seriously gonna let her talk to me like this? Fuck you! Guys, what the hell's going on? Where's Riss? - Why would you tell her? - Shut up, Jess. She doesn't know. Doesn't know what? What's going on? What the hell's going on? Jess? You... you slept with Tristan, didn't you? - Derek, it was only once, okay? - I cannot believe I didn't see this. You know what? Carissa saw it the whole fucking time! How could you do this to me? - How could you do this to Carissa? - It was a mistake, Derek! You know what? We are done! This is fucking done! And you... Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! (CAR ENGINE STARTS) TRISTAN: Everything was fine. You had to open your mouth. - Babe, I'm sorry. - Don't call me that. Don't, no. - (WHISPERING) Mistake. - Tristan.

It's... it's just her period. Tristan, her pills are all over the floor up there. What? Baby, what did you do? - Call Derek. - What if he doesn't answer? Leave a message. # Fuck you, you're dead to me # # Fuck you, you're dead to me # (PHONE BUZZING) # Stand in my way, you're like a barricade # # But I, but I, but I won't stop # - What? - JESS: Derek, you need to come back. - What do you want me to say? - JESS: No, Derek, it's Carissa. There's blood everywhere. (CRYING) We need you here. Derek? Fuck.
