You've got to be the man with the magic. The bing, the bang, the boom, the pop. And ken curzon, he may be 25 years old, but he's got that magic. When he slices salmon, it's fucking pornographic. I get a boner watching this guy cook. That's a chef. Frankly, samir, I know you've been doing this for a few years, But your cooking's cold.

It doesn't pay anything, okay? It's like an apprenticeship. I see. So you are quitting your job where you are making money To go to France to do the same job, mmm? For free? You are a bloody brilliant businessman. I didn't come here to argue with you, okay? That this could be a tremendous opportunity. For what? Going backwards? What's wrong with you? Do you know that you're a bloody old man? Keep it down. If your brother were alive today... He would've been a doctor and you would've been respected, And he would've had a wife, and a family and kids, I understand and I'm doing nothing... Badtameez! You are making mockery of your brother's memory. I'm not making a mockery, okay? I'm just... Your poor mother still thinks a woman will make you change. But you are not interested in bloody anything. Money, business, a career, wife, family. Nothing? You just want to be a loser. So, go, go, go. Go to France, go to England, go to china. Marry a bloody chinese clown-girl, And invite your mother to come and cry at the bloody wedding! Dad, relax, all right? Would you just... I just came to tell you... You okay? Dad. Dad! Samir. Samir.

I'll hold, yes. So this guy, he rips the teabag, And pours it into the water. I don't like teabags. Will you shut up? So I tell him, "arre-bhai, that's not the way you do it. "you take the teabag and you dip it into the water like this." Okay, so now he's very thankful. So I go to the toilet, and when I come back, guess what? He's putting the sugar packets into the water. Thank you, bhai, you ruined my joke! Huh, it is old joke. Not as old as you. Loose tea is better. Never mind the tea business. He's giving you the joke, listen. But loose tea is better. But loose tea is better. He's giving you the joke and you say, "tea, tea, tea." Loose tea is better. Loose tea is better, yes. That bloody restaurant will be the death of you. Hakim: I know. I don't want. And now, this bloody heart-attack-whart-attack business. No good. Honestly, no good. Hakim, you've got to get smart. I'm telling you, franchising is the wave of the future. And of course, I'll make you full partner-whartner, that is not the issue. Let me think it over. Mmm. Did I show you? My nimith is on msnbc. Really? Talking about municipal bonds and such matters, you see? Very good. ...The government has put into the economy. That they essentially primed the pump. So, with the s&p right now... My ali used to listen to me. But samir... I don't know. He has always defied me. Never wanted to listen. And now it's too late. Hakim-bhai. It's never too late to be a father. Sure, easy for you to say. Foot massage? That feels so good. Do you remember when you and ali massaged my feet? And as a joke, you rubbed blue ink all over them. For two weeks, I had blue feet. And then mrs. Sanchez, right, she thought that it was a religious thing Because she'd seen a picture of a hindu god that was blue. Listen, ma, I looked at the books. It's pretty bad. He's not even making any money anymore. You should just sell the place to amit-uncle, He'll give you a good price for it. He'll turn it into some franchise. Kfc. So what? So what? When you look at the restaurant, All you see is peeling paint, broken chairs... You know your dad never wanted to run a restaurant. He dreamed of being a doctor. I know, I know, I know, and dada couldn't Afford to send him to medical school, So he came to this country instead. I know this story, ma. Do you? Do you know that when he came to this country, He became a third-class citizen? America wasn't like it is today. People had never seen an indian before. He worked as a janitor. He worked as a dishwasher in a white man's restaurant. He was so determined. And slowly, slowly, He saved up enough money to start his own business. He worked 18 hours a day, Just so that he wouldn't have to tell his children That he couldn't afford to send them to college. And now, one son is gone. And the other son only sees his failure. Doctor: He's a fighter, but remember, his heart is still weak. He should stay home the next couple of weeks, you know, take it easy. Make sure you monitor his blood pressure regularly, And above all, no stress. You hear that, hakim? No stress. I'm not deaf, woman. Please, madam, my cat is stuck in your tree. Excuse me, waiter? Repeat after m. Waiter! Hello. Yes, yes. This is what you serve to your customers? This greasy slop? Oh. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Excuse me. Stop eating, come on.

Okay, so it's a standard menu, pretty much. Whoa, what is it? What are you doing? Hmm! Masala. Masala is the soul of indian food. And food is the soul of india. Smell it. Of course you can't really tell until it's in the oil. The masala is the symphony, And the oil is the orchestra. The greatest chef in the world taught me that. Really, who? My mother. Come on, come on! Move! A man should have three passions in his life. His country, his religion and his cricket. What about his wife? Wife is not a passion. Wife is an expense. Oh, man. Oh, there.

That's why I'm helping out making deliveries. I know that place, I used to go there all the time When I first moved here from buffalo. But I don't remember it being this good.

What's happening? What? Go, wash yourself. It's time for morning prayers. When did you become religious? Hakim! Hakim, are you all right? Please, woman, you stay out of this.

Stop talking. Okay, just be careful, all right? Follow my hands. Allah... You see! You see? This is what happens. Okay? You can't do this. Come on, hakim. Would you just, please, sit down. Don't do this. Sit down! Jesus! Never mind bloody jesus. Jesus is not going to teach you namaz. Nobody is going to teach you namaz! Only me, your father. Please, please, woman, please. You have never wanted to learn anything from me. Never wanted to listen to me about anything in life. Okay, okay. Please stop. And now, now... Okay, you know what? I'm done. Okay? I'm out of here. All right, I have to go. Beta, it's 6:00 in the morning. I'm meeting someone for breakfast. Meeting? Whom are you meeting? Samir: Nobody you know. See what you did? Now he has a meeting. Please, please, woman. I'm sorry I'm a little early. You're right on time, my friend. Come on in. That was a present from the granddaughter of a maharaja. Oh! Wow, it's beautiful. You didn't need to go to all this trouble, really. No trouble at all. Sharing breakfast with someone is very good for the digestive system. Wow! Mmm-hmm. Oh, my god! Is that you with the queen of England? Yeah, yeah. You know, I was in charge of an orphanage in delhi way back in the '60s. She came over for a visit. What a wonderful, wonderful woman. Such a pity about her kids. Wait, I thought you said that you were a cook in mumbai. That was after I came back from pakistan. I was in partnership with three pakistani guys in karachi. We were all going to be bloody millionaires. Hmm, I thought my future was worked out. I even proposed to the daughter of a wealthy nutmeg merchant. Oh, you can't believe how good she smelt. Really? Hmm. And then her father married her off To a carpet tycoon from kashmir. Never heard from her again. Hmm. You ever think about her? Hmm. Every time I drink eggnog. How is the dosa? It's good. Mmm. It's... It's really good. How do you... How do you get this texture? Ah, you noticed? Mmm-hmm. It's the stone. A griddle has a will of its own. But with a dosa stone, You can determine the character of the dosa according to your mood. Hmm. Seems like you're in a pretty good mood today. Wish I could say the same about you. Well, I had some plans that changed. Ah! I had a million and one plans that changed. Even the ones that worked out didn't work out the way I had planned. Listen, um... About the restaurant, I was... Hmm. Come on, let's go. Cumin. Cumin. It's a saucy wench. Give you great pleasure, but she herself is never satisfied, So be careful. Okay. Coriander seed, Like a young girl walking through a lemon grove by the ocean, Wondering what her future holds. Ah! Cloves and cinnamon. Hmm, like a crazy aunt and uncle. Very noisy, very funny, very opinionated. But a little goes a long way. And turmeric. Ah! Glee! The golden spice. Makes everything glow. You know we used to use turmeric To color the elephants at the delhi circus? You were with the circus? Yes, of course I was with the circus. Come on, come on, you're lagging. Whoa! Don't you want to measure that? A man who measures life will never know his own measure. What, did you read that on a fortune cookie? Actually, yes. So what, you never use a recipe? Everything I need is here, here and here. And a little bit here. All right. Here, come on, you try it. Me? Yeah, of course you, who else? No, no, I don't work like that. Well, come on, give it a try, my friend. Come on! Come on! I don't even know the proportions. Oh! Guess-timate! I thought you said you couldn't tell until it was in the oil. Um, sometimes you can tell. I'm sorry, is everything okay? It's delicious. It reminds me of my grandmother cooking back home. How happy I was then, you know. It's so spicy. Farrida: Samir, are you in there? Mom, I'm on the phone. I'm busy. Why are you taking the phone in the toilet? Mom, I just want some privacy, okay? Samir, are you doing phone sex? Mom. What? Samir, please be a good boy. Mom! Akbar. You nasty little egg! Couple of them got the door loose. They're crafty. Okay. Why are there live chickens in the kitchen? Fresh meat. It's much tastier than that frozen stuff. And it's healthier, too. We can't have live poultry in the kitchen. This is new york. They will shut us down. Nobody's going to find out. There are feathers everywhere. Oh, we'll sweep up. Besides, we have to do something. I just fired that meat guy. You did what? What... Rasool? Yeah. Oh, I chased him out of here with a shank. He's a bloody crook, that fellow. I know he's a crook. Oh, my god! What are these? Menus. Really? I know they're menus. They're too limited. I prefer to improvise. Oh, really? What if people don't want what you improvise? People don't know what they want. They know what they've had. So let's give them something new. Listen to me, okay? Mmm-hmm. I asked you to work here. I want you to work here. But I am in charge here. Do you understand? So before you go hiring people, or firing people, Or ordering live chickens, okay, you have to ask me first. I am the boss. Do you understand? Oh, yes, boss. Here, have some lunch. Take that thing off your head. But I was told... Would you just take it off? Yes, sir. I know everything that is going on. You tell my chef to fuck himself while he's praying namaz. What? Namaz. Please, calm down. Your heart. And you could use a nicer word. Okay, he wasn't praying namaz. He was, like, eating lunch. You threw his things. You hit him! Beta, roti? No, ma. I didn't hit him. I didn't hit anybody. Beta, man cannot live on frosty frosty. How can a human being do this, huh? Whose child is this? What are you... Calm down, hakim, he said he didn't hit him. Beta, it's very bad to hit someone when they are praying. I didn't hit him while he was praying. I didn't hit him, okay? He was eating lunch and he was spitting paan juice all over the kitchen Which is a health code violation. Are you bloody lecturing me about my business? Sala, I made that restaurant before I made you. That's not true, hakim. Please, please, woman. I'm not talking to you. Arre, you have hired a bloody taxi cab driver to cook food in my restaurant? Yes, yes, but he was a chef in mumbai. Of course he was. And I used to be the king of sweden. You didn't know that, huh? And your mother is the bloody michael jordan. Anything anybody tells you, you believe, except your father. You know what? This is exactly... You know, I'm not going to fight with you, all right? I have to go to work. Amit-bhai is right. I should just sell the bloody restaurant. One less headache around my neck. Akbar: Nah, not yet. Not yet. You have to wait until the flavor Of the aromatics is fully absorbed by the oil. You got to trust your senses. Now? Now, now. There you go! Give it a stir. I know. You think too much, you know. Always remember, from here, here and here. All three. You cook only from there, everything turns out cerebral. Okay, you know what, that's great, But cooking isn't all just here and here and here. Yes, of course, you've got to have some structure as well. You don't put chilies into a jalebi. But with indian cooking, a recipe is like a raaga in indian music. You know raaga? It's just a template. The important thing is the interpretation, The improvisation. You ever been in love? Yeah. I mean, no, I don't... I don't know. You don't know? A person who's been in love, knows he's been in love. Ah, with my wife, it was love at first sight. The first time I looked into her eyes, Everything disappeared. What happened to her? She died the summer after we were married during childbirth. The baby died as well. I'm sorry. I had a brother. He died in a car accident. I'm sorry. You must miss him. You know what, I don't know why I'm doing this, actually. I'm a chef. I don't need to learn how to cook from a cab driver. I didn't... I... I didn't mean that. Come here, I want to show you something. Come here, come here. You know, my parents were killed during partition. I got that trying to save them. Of course I couldn't, I was only a child. So, I was orphaned. Throughout my childhood, I kept asking myself, "why?" And then, one day I was out walking in a field, a storm blew up. Right in front of my eyes, this huge tree got struck by lightning. Boom! It split into two. And suddenly, I was filled with an overwhelming joy. Why? Because it was the only sensible way to feel. You're alive. You brother no longer has that chance, you do. I think you should take it. It'll help your masala. Carrie: Hello? Samir: Carrie? I was wondering when I'd hear from you. Samir: I meant to call earlier. Carrie: You did, or at least your parents did. I have it on my caller id. Samir: Oh, right. Carrie: Oh, busted. Samir: Hmm. Samir: Actually, I was hoping that you'd let me take you out to dinner. Carrie: Sure. Will your parents be coming? Samir: They will not. Hi. Hi. So you ready to go? Yeah. And I have the perfect place. You know, I made this reservation at this... This is better. Really? Come on. Yeah. What? You don't like my place. No, I... I was just expecting something With a few more amenities, that's all. Like a table, chair, I don't know, maybe a ceiling. Oh, I get it. What? You're a food snob. Samir: I'm not a snob. I just happen to know A little about food sanitation. Okay. Well? Mmm! Good, it's good. Mmm-hmm. See? When I eat something like this, I remember why I got into cooking in the first place. What about you? What's the first thing that you ever cooked? Samosas. Yeah, my brother and I, we used to sneak Into the restaurant kitchen after school. We used to have this old cook. He was amazing. The way his hands moved, he was like a magician. He used to let us play with the spices, All the colors and the smells, and... It was great. I used to love going back there. Hmm. Sorry, ma'am, we're not open for another hour or so. Oh, well, thank you. But I was only looking for my son. Oh! You must be samir's mother? Salam walaikum. You must be very proud. Of course, it's evident where he gets his spirit, his good looks. What a fortunate fellow to have someone like yourself for his mother. Excuse me, but what is your good name please? Akbar hamidbhai khambati. But you can call me akbar. So, you are from khambhat? Khambhat, of course. Baldiwala is my father's best friend's neighbor. Because, you see, my sister married Baldiwala's sister's middle son. Uh-huh. I'm rassiwala's daughter. Hey, farrida, the older one. Yes, yes, of course. Aaiye, aaiye. Come in, please. Uh, music not bothering you, I hope. Oh, no, no, no, not bothering. I tell you, nobody can sing a love song like mukesh. Wah, wah, wah. I used to sing this song to my wife. But your husband must also be singing to you. Hmm? How could he not? Well, of course. In fact, my husband, he asked me to come here, Oh, please tell your husband that I am most fortunate To be working with your son. He runs a very tight ship. Ship shape. I'm proud to call him my boss. Oh! Well... Good! Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. Oh, uh... If you want to die, If you want to die, Why don't you just kill yourself? Darling? So, did you go to the restaurant? Yes. Ah. And you saw the taxi driver? Yes. What did he say to you? Many things. What's wrong with you, huh? Why can't you talk? You want to know what he said to me? Well, I'll tell you what he said to me. He said, I'm a very beautiful woman. He said I'm filled with spirit. And he sang to me a love song he used to sing to his wife. A love song? Which love song? Sorry, we're a little late. You are right on time, my friend. Akbar, this is carrie. Carrie. Carrie, meet akbar. This is an honor. Nice to meet you. Come in, come in, my friends. Welcome, welcome. I hope you don't mind, I've invited some friends of mine. Notorious reprobates of course, But they do enjoy fine cuisine. Sit, sit, carrie, sit please. Hi, I'm carrie. Patel. Shah. Babu. Howdy? Hi, nice to meet you. Shahjahani biryani. Mmm, it's named after the mughal emperor who built the taj mahal. He was also a renowned glutton. He tends to be a show off when it comes to beautiful woman. Well, I don't see anything wrong with that. Roast leg of lamb. And chicken hara bhara. And this is my specialty, ande ki bhurji. What's that? Scramble egg. Scrambled eggs. Scrambled eggs. Yeah, put a little scramble egg here. Samir: My goodness. Pass me that. Where did you get these? This? Oh, I found them in a chinese market. They reminded me of a dish I ate once in pondicherry. Oh, pondicherry? Pondicherry was a french colony, you know? The only french colony in india. I've always considered it one of the great tragedies of history, That the french in india never made it further up north. Just think of it. Two of the finest cuisines in the world. The french and the indian coming together For an epicurean meeting of the minds. Instead, we end up getting colonized by the bloody british, Whose greatest culinary achievement in 2,000 years Is the fish and chips. Whether it's a frenchman or englishman occupying your land, It's still occupation. The french cooking is heavy. But, is there a trick to... Well, the trick is, Pick it up, don't flick it. Pick it up and put it in your mouth. And that's it. You know, the shah of iran visited india once, And he was heard to remark that eating with a utensil Is like making love through an interpreter. Mmm! Yeah, it's good, man. Why don't you pass the eggplant? Okay. Thank you. Samir: You know, when I was a kid, My dad used to bring ali and I up to our roof, Just to look out at those lights. He used to say, "in a place with lights like that, "any dream can come true." What happened? It's time for morning prayers. Samir, what did you do? Look what you did. Who told you to do this? Nobody told you to do this. Why did you do this? I wanted to make it like it used to be. Like it used to be. But things are not like they used to be. Don't you understand that? Samir, I'm not keeping the restaurant. Amit-bhai is going to buy it from me. Okay, dad, You don't have to, because business is really picking up. And I'm telling you if we... Listen to me, samir. I'm closing the restaurant. Amit-bhai is right. It's too much for me with my heart. Besides, ali is gone. And you're grown. What am I breaking my back for? Dad, you're wrong. You're wrong. Dad, it's your restaurant. If you just give it away, then what the hell was it all for? Dad, it's our restaurant! Andrei. Pierre. Was it 225? Yes. Or was it 250? Yes. Pierre, you ever slept with two woman at the same time? Yes. You, rascal. I'm sorry, guys. So, on to new adventures. Do you ever get discouraged? Despair is the solace of fools, my friend. I tell you, they're really a fount of wisdom. Well, khuda hafiz. Thank you, akbar. Truly my pleasure, samir. Samir, what brings you here? Oh, I was just looking for steve. Is he... Oh, he's upstairs actually. Okay, thanks. Hey, congratulations. Samir, I was about to call you. What the hell are you doing here? Hi. Oh, wow! Well, I was gonna get on my hands and knees And beg steve for my job back. Job? What the hell are you talking about? You're famous. What? Oh! The times! You got three stars. Look, "best indian in new york." trust me. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Wow! Three stars and it would have been four, Except the decor was for shit. Oh, my god. I gotta go there. Yeah, go, go! Yeah! Be careful with that. Careful with that. That's my persian fertility relic. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, samir! Where are you going? Akron, ohio. What? Akron, the city of the future! You know, about a year ago, I met a guy from akron, ohio in my taxi. He was in import-export. I told him, "way back in the '70s, "I used to be part owner of a company "that exported lotas from calcutta." He seemed very interested in my idea. Yeah, lotas. You know, that metal bucket, That villagers in india carry water in, We're going to export those lotas to paris, For the french to chill their champagne. Okay, you can't leave. You know why? Because we got three stars. Oh-ho, very impressive. Yeah. "veritable symphony of flavors. "inspired choice of spices. Inspired... Blah, blah, blah, "one occasion, the murghi masala was a little dry." Ignorant bastard. So, I need you to come back. Yes, I do. Because in about an hour, There's gonna be 100 people in that restaurant. Why, that's wonderful! That's wonderful. Yeah, and some of them may be hungry. So, I don't know what you want me to do. Remember what I told you? From here, here and here. It's not my cooking that they're coming for. It's yours. You are the chef. Not me. You were beginning to get the hang of it. Now just don't think too much. I can't do what you did. Don't do what I did. Do what you do. I don't know what that is. Don't worry, it'll come to you. Samir? Mom. Yeah, put dad on the phone. Farrida: He's not here, beta. He's gone to see amit-bhai. What, he hasn't seen the review? He hasn't... Okay, mom, I have to go. Please call him and tell him To come to the restaurant immediately, okay? All right. I love you. Andrei: Step back. Step back. Step back. Keep it clear. Step back. Keep it clear. We're not to open for another two hours. Sounds like it's worth the wait. I told you, she knew everyone. I bought you another copy. Thank you for coming back. Thank you. It'll be just a few more minutes. Step back. Keep it clear. You guys busy? What am I saying? Of course you're not busy. Come with me. No, I'm really serious. Come with me. Come on. Let's go. Take this all back to the kitchen. Straight back. Straight back to the kitchen. I'll be right in. Andrei: Excuse me. It's an even dice. See, like this. Carrie? I... I figured that you might need a little help. Oh. And, I got you a little present, Chef. Thanks. Okay, come on, cover up. You know what, this is crazy. I think I'm just gonna get the recipes, Just to get the basic proportions. Okay? Okay, I'll be right back. No. Pierre, you said, "no." That's it? That's it. The magic is all in here. You sure? Sometimes you can't tell until it's in the oil. So... Come on, everyone. Let's get to work! Okay, whip in this ghee, all right? Whip it in nice and good. Who's on that dal? Whip it in. Don't let it puddle, okay? Samir: All right. Yeah, yeah. Put some of this in there. There we go. Beautiful. Okay, that's looks good. That's great. Put in some of this. Yeah, keep stirring. Keep stirring. Okay, don't overdo it on the tamarind glaze. Two half tandoori chops of lamb With gnocchi in summer pea puree. Next to it is a baby goat garam masala On top of jerusalem artichoke puree with cardamom braised carrots. Just little squiggles, little squiggles. That looks beautiful. Just hurry up on those garnishes. You can't hurry a work of art. Samir: Looks good. Looking good, everybody. What's a guy gotta do to get a table in this joint? Well, you can take these to table two. Go. It's a wild king salmon encrusted in mustard seed. Then roasted in the tandoor oven And finished in mango-pickle beurre blanc. Samir: How we coming along? We're running low on... Yeah, that. And otherwise, everything's good. Samir? Not now, mom. Uh, how's that vindaloo? Coming, chef. But, samir... Not now, mom. Uh, I need more cilantro sprigs. But, samir... Mom, what? It's just that they're asking for you. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy your meal. Enjoy your food. I think it is time for me to meet this cab driver. He's gone. He's gone? Who cooked all this food? You? Your father was just saying, How much he regrets not having tasted your cooking And how much he's looking forward to it. Isn't that right, hakim? This is bloody good food. I'm sorry, amit-bhai. I'm afraid the deal is off. I'm going into business With my son. You don't introduce us to your friend, beta? Mom, dad, This is carrie. She's my Sous-chef. Sous-chef? She helped with everything. That's wonderful. I'm so pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you also. Very nice. Thank you. Excuse me. You know what? We should head back. Oh, yeah, go, go, go. Don't worry about us. Go, go.
