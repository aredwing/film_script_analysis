Don't treat my store as a charity. My dad asks if you can help him out. He'll pay you in a few days. At least pay a little, if not, forget it. Towkay, if you don't give us any rice, we won't have anything to eat. Hey, do I owe you a living? What does your plight have to do with me? Okay. Okay. You can take two cans of rice. One can. Half a can! Half a can! Not that sack. That's Grade A rice. The sack next to it! I said half a can. Half a can! Half a can! Don't think I can't see what you are up to! Towkay, do you have unwanted goods? It's at the same place. Take them yourself. All these? Thank you. Okay. Huh? We only eat soy sauce with rice. Sigh... Thanks Towkay. Forget it! Forget it! Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you hurt? You are so naughty! What were you doing? My sister's shoes, I left them here. Now, they're gone. Are you implying I stole them? No! No! No? Things don't disappear from my store. So what were you implying? I... But... I really left the shoes here. You are still at it? Your dad owes me money yet I'm still giving you supplies. How can you say such things? Here! Go home! Go home! Why are you still here? Go home! Okay... Go home! Go home! Brother, are my shoes mended? They're all done. Can you tell they've been mended? Looks good. Can't tell at all. Where are they? Do they really look good? Where are they? I remember leaving them at the entrance of the store. But I don't know what happened... They disappeared. Disappeared? You are lying to me, right? I only have that pair of shoes. I can't go to school without my shoes tomorrow. My slippers are also broken. Look. Okay... Stop crying. I'll go find your shoes now. Kun! Please don't tell mom. What did you say? I said I'm going to the toilet! Kun! Kun! What are you up to lately? The quality of your goods is getting worse. Are they? I'm not making it up. Don't believe me? See for yourself! Where? Look at the amount of goods I ordered from you. Here are 50 bags. Look. And over here, what kind of dried chilli peppers are these? Even if I sell them cheap, no one will buy! Didn't I bring over another 5 bags last time? Okay. Let me check! I don't recall! I did! You are right. 5 bags. What about flour? 5 bags, right? I don't recall either! You are right. What about salt? Hey! Can you ask everything at once? What else? Oh, that's all. Talk in instalments! Make me run back and forth! Oh yes... Hey... Eh? How did this brick move out of place? Once it's out of place, the whole pile will fall! Who is the naughty one? Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! My leg! Let's get rid of this stuff! Who touched the display? I arranged them nicely this morning. There are other things to play with, yet they choose to play with my goods! So who was it? Where is my accounts book? Hey! Don't touch my things. I'll get it! I looked. I can't find it. I'm back! How's business today? Eh? Why are you bleeding at the side of your mouth? It's nothing. There was an explosion at McDonald's Building today. A few people were killed! Really? So how's business today? I'll cut more banana leaves tomorrow. I asked you how's business today? We'll have this for dinner tonight. I have already cooked rice. Been selling this for 3 days. Can't sell it anymore. Keep the rice for tomorrow. Your mom says you were not home all day. Were you out playing? You are already so old. Can you be more responsible? Your mom is pregnant. You don't help her at home but play instead? You want to be caned? That's enough. You are pregnant. Why are you still carrying heavy things? Can you see she needs help? The landlord was here again. He says if we don't pay some rent, he'll evict us immediately. What is he saying? I'm not lazy. I am willing to do anything! I sell red bean soup, cut banana leaves, make Tikam, I even collect shit. What else can I do? Not that I don't want to work, but I really can't find a job! Can't they understand? They just say what comes to their mind! Where's the other scissors? Where is it? Seow Fang, see if it is there. Bring it to me. You must put things back where you took them from. We will have to buy new ones if we lose them. Waste money! Do you know we can't put food on the table? The provision shop owner wants us to pay up. If we don't, he will not sell us anything. What is he saying? These people are so typical. When he first started his shop... How am I going to school without my shoes? I'm thinking. Can you not be so anxious? Of course you are not anxious. You have shoes! I'm anxious too. But if I show it, dad and mom will know. If they know, they will buy me new shoes. Don't tell them! Or we will be in trouble! What are you doing? Nothing. Nothing. Then grab your glue and help with the Tikam! Look at them. I wonder what the two are up to. Why are you standing there? Aren't you going to help? What should I do? Do what? I asked brother what should I do since I don't have any glue. You lost it, right? I told you not to misplace things. No glue? Just use your brother's. Oh yes! Share mine! But... But your glue can is huge! Itll be easier and faster! Quickly glue them on the board! Look at her shoes... They are huge... So huge! Ha ha ha... Her shoes are so huge! So dirty... Students, next month is the Village Concert Night, and you'll be performing a dance item, so I hope you'll be serious about the rehearsals. Okay? Okay! Good! I'm going to show you a little routine. Just dance like me and you'll be fine! Okay, look! Little stars. Little stars. The sky is filled with little stars. The sky is filled with glitter. The sky is filled with little stars. Doesn't that look nice? Yes! All you have to do is to learn that routine and repeat it 30 times for the performance. Isn't that easy? Yes. But take note of the action for "Little Stars, Little Stars". And the "1... 2... 3... Kick!" That's the hardest to master. So let's practice the kick now! Ready! Heads up. Chest out. Hands out. Ready... You are not quite there yet. Let's do it again. Be more serious! Okay. Ready! Heads up. Chest out. Hands out. Ready... Wait a minute. Other than Seow Fang, the rest of you stand behind me. Why aren't you kicking? Ready. 1... 2... 3... Kick. Why aren't you kicking? One more time! Ha... Ha... Ha... You asked me to kick. Is this your shoe? You call this a shoe? It's huge like a boat! Why wear such big shoes to school? I... I wore my brother's shoes by mistake. How can you wear someone's shoes by mistake? You are so foolish! Hey, hurry up! Run faster! You should have run faster. Do you know I'll be late? I ran as fast as I could. Your shoes are huge. If I run too fast, they will slip off. See me tomorrow in the office! Okay, go back! Hey! You! Come here! First time? Last time, okay? Yes, Sir. Get back to your class! Thank you, Sir. Stop fooling around! Kun, why are you so late? Why are you late? We are playing with Beng Soon's team tomorrow, this time, we must... I can't play tomorrow because I lost Seow Fang's school shoes and I need to find them. Huh? You lost your sister's shoes, what did she wear to school today? This pair! Huh? This pair? You can't do that! A guy's shoes cannot be worn by a girl. You will have 3 consecutive years of bad luck! Yes! You cannot imagine the kind of bad luck! You eat a fish ball, you choke. You go to the toilet, you can't shit. You climb a tree, it falls. You climb a mountain, you fall. You walk, you fall. With each test or exam, your result gets worse. Once I wore my elder sister's pants by accident, I scored a zero on my test the next day. Hey, you wearing your younger sister's pants now? Why are they so short? Kun, we are good buddies. We will definitely help you. When we play soccer tomorrow, why not ask Beng Soon for shoes for Seow Fang? Seow Hay is so clever! He's the richest kid in our village - Beng Soon. Since his father bought him a soccer ball for his birthday, every boy played soccer with him, one after another. Initially, we were all fooling around. But over time, the bad players were eliminated. The better ones like us, formed a team and named it "Rojak". It's a team with all kinds of people. We never expected Beng Soon's dad, who owns a shoe store, to take us so seriously. He bought soccer shoes and jerseys for the team. Since we are in the same team, Beng Soon says we share everything. So we are the first village soccer team to have our own soccer shoes and jerseys. Over time, the team grew to have more good players and the problems surfaced. Eh? Where did the ball go? Stop! Stop! Stop! You be the defender and you be the striker. You come over here and you go over there. You get out of the team! And you... you be the goalkeeper. Fatty, you be the striker too. No! No! No! Kun is really fast as a striker. He... he's wasted as a goalkeeper. Look at him. Does he look like a striker to you? He's right! I can't charge ahead. I can block. I have big a surface area. When I stand at the goal post, I block it. I'm the captain. When I say Kun be the goalkeeper, means he's the goalkeeper. When I say Fatty be the striker, means he's the striker. I'm just stating the facts. I don't want the team to suffer. Say that again. Who's causing the team to suffer? Can you not be so fierce? How am I fierce? Enough! Stop arguing over this! We should go separate ways. Your friends can go with you. My friends can come with me. Take what is yours. Take what is yours. Return us everything else. Return us everything else. The ball. Grab the stuff. Let's go. We were supposed to be a team playing soccer. Instead, we are being kicked out like a ball. I thought I could ask Beng Soon for a pair of shoes for Seow Fang. But now... It's about to rain. Bring the clothes in! And bring your shoes in too. Don't let them get wet! I have been getting zeros for my Math assignments. That Mrs Ang is coming after me soon. How did that happen? Because Kun and Seow Hay used to do our assignments. I asked you guys to do it, and you asked them? We... we didn't know how to do them. You guys look clever and yet you didn't know how? They are from Primary 5. We are from Primary 6. And yet they can do our assignments? Come on. Think of a way! Seow Fang, what are you doing? You haven't answered all the questions, and you are rushing off? Where are you rushing to? Seow Fang! Seow Fang! Thank you! Hurry up! Faster! Do you know you are later than yesterday? Why are your shoes wet? I'm going to be late again! Looking for me, is it? Late again? What's your name? Chew Kiat Kun, Sir! What class? Monday 7 am report to me. Is that clear? Yes, Sir. You can't be late for school everyday. I need to wait for my shoes from my sister. Our team has no shoes. I don't know what to do. My sister has no shoes. I don't know what to do too. Good thing you have us as friends! We may not have shoes for you but Little Red Dot has a pair! I'm here! I'm here! Why are you carrying such a big bag? The bag is not big. I'm just small. Whatever. Show us the shoes! Huh? So small? The shoes are not small. You are just big! So small, you might as well not bring them! Hey, where's your sense of humour? I'm just kidding! I see... Here! She needs shoes for school and you bring slippers? You are small. Is your brain small too? I'll take the slippers! Don't bully me just because I'm small in size! Oops! Fatty stepped on cow dung! Damn! Where can I get water? There's a well ahead. Let's wash it there. Come! See. Without Seow Hay and gang, our soccer game is so peaceful. Yes. They can't form a team without ball and shoes. I'm sure they will be begging you soon. Speak of the devil! Huh? What should we do? Should we leave? This land belongs to Beng Soon's grandpa. Why should we leave? Hey, it's Beng Soon and gang. How? We are just not playing soccer together. We still belong to the same village. Let's greet each other. Hey! Good day to you! We just kicked them out a few days ago. Now, they are smiling and acting friendly. So fake! We will pretend too! Okay! Hey! Good day to You! Wow! They said "You" with respect! You means we are bigger than them! Wow! I have finally grown up! Which part of you has actually grown? Don't kid yourself, okay? Why did you greet them with "You"? We are older and bigger than them. If you use "You", it'll make us look small, idiot! Well, it's only pretending. We have to be older and bigger than them. Idiot! Yes, idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Now they are calling us idiots, but they made us feel bigger earlier. What does it mean? It means we are "Big Idiots"! You have to read between the lines. I'm smart enough to know! Are they asking for a fight? Come on, let's fight! Enough! Fighting won't solve anything. Fatty, you want water, right? We'll go over to get water to wash your feet. Then we'll go home, okay? We must not start a fight with them. We must maintain our smiles. It's very sensitive now. I think we are about to fight! How do you know? A knife hidden behind smiles! Right! A knife hidden behind smiles! But where's the knife? Let's walk over slowly! Ouch! Stupid branch! What are you doing here? They are holding up a stick! It's a fight! Quick! Everyone! Don't move! Put it down! Put it down! You have misunderstood us. Little Red Dot moved the branch aside. It was in his way. Yes! Yes! Yes! We are not here to fight. Same here. Do you guys want water? This water belongs to my grandpa. But your grandpa said everyone can drink this water. Your grandpa is dead. Even if we drink it, he won't know. Beng Soon's grandpa is dead but he is not. From today, whoever wants to drink the water here, will have to ask him for permission. Okay! Hey, what are you doing? Washing my feet! What did you step on? Oh, it's cow dung. Hey! Cow dung? You let that filthy water seep into the ground, and we drink that same water in the future! No worries, it's okay! The water will be clean after filtration in the ground! We have been drinking the same water for years. Only the water you drink is filthy! The water we drink is clean! Wow! I can't believe he said something so hurtful. Is it constructive at all? He's so petty even over water. Can we still remain friends? How are the slippers? They are okay. I need a favour from you tomorrow. You want me to run faster? No. The principal is punishing me for being late. He wants me at school in the morning to sweep floors. So... What should I wear to school? What you are wearing now. My teacher will punish me. That plank is slipping off. Push it back. Okay. If only my school shoes weren't missing. Let's deliver the Tikam. Maybe the towkay will give us more work. Okay. Work hard! Thank you, towkay. Please don't hit me! Please don't hit me! Help! If you don't pay us the protection fee, I will beat you up each time I see you, until you are like a dead dog! Let's go! Dad, are you alright? Seow Fang. Kun. Dad is okay. Did you see them beating me? Well, I started the fight. I'm fine. I will be selecting from among you all to represent the school in the National Schools Track and Field Competition. So wear your shoes properly and tie your laces firmly. So that you can jump further later. Is that clear? Eh? You hurt your foot? Can you still jump? Huh? Go rest over there. Anyone else injured? Are you ready? One more time. Raise your arms. No good. Again! Very good! Keep it up! I'll never tell lies again. 68. I'll never tell lies again. 69. I'll never tell lies again. 70. Say it louder! Say it louder. 71. Say it louder. 72. Say it louder. 73. Kun, I think we can talk to Beng Soon about playing soccer together again. Seow Hay, I am being punished now. Can we talk about soccer another day? Hey, here comes the principal! Teacher, I thought he is supposed to sweep the basketball court alone. Why are there so many of them here? Who are you? We? We are his classmates. I see. So you are here to help him? Yes. Helping each other is what we learned from school. Great, this is your punishment and you get your friends to help you? Come back again tomorrow at 7 am to report to me! Is that clear? Yes, Sir. Look. Look at your homework. Look at your handwriting. It's two different people's handwriting. I know you are very involved in your football games lately, so you have no time to do my homework, right? Huh? You are not respecting me. And I hate students who cheat. From now onwards, I want you to do your homework just like before! Do you understand? Do the homework like before. Which means we have to look for Kun and Seow Hay? I just want to let you know, that asking people to do your homework is a very serious offence. I have to punish you now! Who's outside? Seow Fang, this pencil writes beautifully. You can have it. Towkay, do you still want the burned ones? Can I have a piece? Thanks. Seeing sister smile again makes me feel a little better. But more bad news comes our way. Times are bad. I have to deduct some money. Sorry! Is it heavy? I'll carry it for you. Brother, if we make loads of these Tikam, will it be enough to buy my shoes? Should be enough. That's fine. We'll call you once the new ones arrive. Have a good day. Good-bye! Have a good day! Put it back! I said put it back! Who said you could touch? Beng Soon gave strict orders not to sell to you. In any case, can you afford our shoes? Put it back and leave the store! Put it back! Put it back!!! Go now! Go! Go! Go! Leave the store! Get lost! Get lost! Okay... leaving! I told you not to touch anything! They agreed to give us the soccer shoes but like before we need to do their homework. Let's go! Where to? To negotiate with them. Over there! I don't know what a negotiation is. Seow Hay says, negotiation is when each gains and loses a little. Both parties give in a little to each other. If one party gains in every way, then it's not a negotiation. It will be a robbery. The terms for the shoes are different this time. Last time, it was 3 pairs for 3 sets of homework. Now, it's 3 pairs for 6 sets of homework. Wouldn't it be fairer if it's 6 pairs for 6 sets? You want fair? Let's discuss a package deal. Package deal? Inclusive of delivery to school! And you must return the marbles we lend you. Okay, we can return the marbles. You will lend us the ball whenever we play soccer. And if our kites fly into your house, you can't destroy them. Fine. Then forget the package deal. Huh? Why drop the package deal? Hey, didn't you just say 6 pairs for 8 sets? Hey, we promised to lend you shoes and ball, and not destroy your kites, yet you are still unhappy? Is this a delaying tactic? What? Now you accuse us of delaying tactic? Okay. Okay. 6 pairs for 10 sets. It's settled. Kun, that's unfair! The going rate for the next class is 6 pairs for 15 sets of homework. We are being kind and they think we are bullying them. Okay! My final decision. Huh? There's a final decision? Hey, from the start of the negotiations you have been changing your terms! Do you know that? It is you who are changing your terms. Are you trying to be sneaky? Are you afraid to do the homework? It's not a matter of homework anymore. It's an issue of trust! If you don't want to do the homework, just admit it. What does it have to do with trust? That's right! Okay. Okay. One of them has to be school shoes for a girl. Kun, they... They are taking advantage of us! It's okay. I'll do the extra homework. So, we are reasonable, right? Yes! No more homework! We never go hungry negotiating with Beng Soon. Because we end up taking in all the crap. But it's better than nothing. Deliver this promptly at 11am to our school. We want you to deliver it and not Seow Hay! Brother, thank you. Here, it's ready. It's still hot. I'll help you to your room to drink it. Why make me health tonic? Isn't it wasteful? It's not for you. It's for my child. You two better sleep early! Sleep early! Brother, they make you do so much homework. Are they bullying you? Not really. They need us to do their homework. We need them for their shoes. We both benefit. So no one is really bullying anyone. Do you guys often quarrel? That's just the way we communicate. Really? Wouldn't that lead to problems later? It should not. Just like dad and mom, and you and I, there are times when we have trouble communicating. But once we work it out, the problem is solved! If it doesn't work out, would it lead to a fight? We will never fight to resolve our problems! Hey, once I hand them their homework tomorrow, you don't have to wear my shoes anymore! Go to sleep! I want to keep you company. Brother, where are you going so early? I have to take the homework to Beng Soon. Didn't they say 11am? I want to be early and wait for them. But it's only 6.30am. Really? It didn't seem that early. Kun! Kun! Finally finished it! Too bad they asked you to deliver it to them. And that stupid principal, he has to punish you so early in the morning. Enough! Stop it! Hey! You are wearing slippers? The principal will make you sweep Singapore! Brother! Take the shoes! Don't worry about me! The principal wants me to tell you, being late is a bad habit. To punish you, is to help you kick the habit. Okay, you go sweep there. You sweep the basketball court. You clean the toilets. And you... Hey, you hurt your foot? Okay. You go to the principal's office. Come in! Clean this! These belong to our office. The principal wants them cleaned. Do you think Kun will come? I say he won't come! Do you think he will give our assessment books to the peanut seller to use as wrappers? From his tone of voice yesterday I sensed he didn't want to do our homework. He definitely won't come! I think he won't come too! He would have showed up otherwise! He's out to get us for revenge! Hey! Here are your assessment books. At least you kept your promise. Our shoes... Continue to do our homework and you can have the shoes for a year. We are gathering at the usual place tomorrow. Join us! Ask Seow Hay to come along as well! Pick up the stuff outside! These belong to the office and need to be cleaned! Finished? Yes, Sir. So you cleaned all? Yes, Sir. I only asked you to clean some! Huh? Anyway, good boy. Let me tell you, one more time, one more time if you are late, you are out of my school! Is that clear? Yes, Sir. Just now I had a nightmare, I dreamed that there were many monsters flying above me, I cannot breathe! With everyone's help we did their homework for them and in turn have the shoes for one year plus a pair of shoes for my sister. With the soccer shoes, we can play on any terrain. Look at the way Seow Hay plays! It's under such conditions we gain greater hope for our team! But Seow Fang has mixed feelings about her shoes. She's happy to receive a new pair of shoes. But the shoes will only fit her when she goes to university. It's all my fault, I need to think of a way. Hey, you are so greedy! Speak for yourself! Is this too much? But you do look like a pig! Don't talk nonsense! Here I am! What is this? Bread. Ah Kun's bread? I love it! Bread? Beng Soon is in a good mood today. He hardly ever smiles so much. The pair of shoes for my sister is too big, I want to exchange them. Everyone at school laughed at her when she wore them. It's your fault. My fault? Okay, since it's my fault, let's throw them away! Beng Soon! Beng Soon! Beng Soon! Beng Soon! Please give me back the shoes! Beng Soon! Beng Soon! Beng Soon! That's the problem with you guys. Your sister wanted shoes, and we kindly agreed. But when they don't fit, it becomes our problem. Not even a word of thanks. You guys are too much! Okay. Okay. It's fine even if they're too big. Beng Soon, please return the shoes to me! Beng Soon! Don't! Beng Soon! Beng Soon! If you want the shoes back, you have two choices. One. Do more homework for us. Two. Let's fight. Why do you resort to fighting so easily? We are from the same village! That's right! When did I say that? You did! You did! When did I say that? You just did! When did I say fight? You dead fat pig! Hey, how can you call me a dead fat pig? I'm very much alive. Huh? I'm a lively fat pig! Huh? Enough! We don't have to fight to prove our might. We can play soccer. If you win, you can bring your sister to my store and pick out a new pair of shoes. Kun, don't worry. We'll win the shoes for you. Hey! Our secret weapon! What secret weapon? Chicken Essence! Wow! Chicken Essence! Only one bottle? There are so many of us! You are right! I have no choice but to drink it myself. Hey! Leave some for us! Faster! Faster! What are you doing? Dreaming? Why are you so dumb? It's so simple, yet you couldn't save it? I could do that when I was three! I don't mean to yell at you but you are a retard! Okay, Ah Guang! You do it! Huh? I should have kept quiet! Pass the ball to me! Quick! It's a goal! Hey! What did you do? Do you know this is our goal post? Look at where you have kicked the ball! Huh? Beng Soon, thanks. Can I bring my sister to your store tomorrow? Did you win? Hey, it was 3 - 2. Didn't we win? Who scored the winning goal? I did! Hey! Heard that? You have the cheek to ask me for the shoes? Whatever it is, according to the rules, we won. Can you please abide by those rules? That's right! Who says I'm not abiding by the rules? The shoes are mine. So I decide on the rules. I want to resign! I don't want to be the captain! You go solve your own problems! What happened? What happened to you? What are we to do without you? What's the team to do without you? Enough! I have made up my mind. Oh no! What are we to do? We only lent them shoes and they played so well! I thought they wouldn't even score a goal yet they scored two! Two goals! They got a pig for a goalkeeper and you couldn't even score a goal. Why is that so? If we can't even beat Seow Hay's team, how can we compete with other teams? I have a way to deal with them. Sorry, our team doesn't have enough shoes, so we need the shoes back. How can you do that? One moment you give them to us. Next you want them back. One more thing, on this paper you gave Kun, it says we can have the shoes for one year! That's right! Hey, how can you do that? How can you show our letter to others? How can we write you any letter in the future? Yes, it's like writing a letter to a girlfriend and then showing the letter to the world! Don't you think that's unreasonable? I merely wanted to clarify. All of you refuse to tell the truth. How can you just show the letter to others? Doesn't your teacher teach you anything? Yes! Yes? Then all that is wasted! What about you changing arguments every time? Doesn't your teacher teach you anything? Yes! Then all that is wasted too! It's wasted on you guys! No, it's wasted on you guys! It's wasted on you guys! It's wasted on you guys! It's wasted on you guys! No, it's wasted on you guys! For a small issue, we argued again. We are arguing because what we agreed upon is now not valid. No shoes means no soccer team. To us, shoes are just shoes. To Beng Soon, the shoes mean something else. Enough! Let's go! Seow Hay! Seow Hay! How can we play without shoes? A good team doesn't worry about not having shoes. We worry if our hearts are not in the right place. Our hearts are in the right place! Without our hearts, we will die! What about our homework? Yes. Do it ourselves! I don't believe with a little hard work, we can't do our homework! Right! Hey, does this look like Kun's handwriting? Where? It does! Looks just like it! Mr and Mrs Tan, I'm so sorry I have to do this. But this is not the first time. Take a look at this. This handwriting is so ugly! You see, last time his handwriting was so nice! But now you see, the handwriting looks so horrible! That's why I know he got someone to do this. This is a very serious offence. So I would suggest you ask him to stop playing football, if not, he will be out of this school. Get up! Why didn't you do your homework yourself? Why did you get someone to do it for you? And you have to find someone with worse handwriting! Do you know how much we dote on you? We won't forgive you for doing badly in school! From today, you are not to play soccer again! Until you show better results at school! You'll stop all activities related to soccer! Let's go! Looks like we have to send him to England! Class, everyone did well in the recent test. The top 3 students get a pen as a gift from me. First, Tan Seow Hay. Next, Liu Hong Soon. Lastly, the student with the highest score on the test. He is Chew... Kiat... Kun! Brother, hurry up! Or you will be late! Run faster. Eh? The shoes are broken! Run faster. Brother, the shoes can't be worn anymore. Look! We have given up hope getting shoes from Beng Soon. But we still hope to find her old shoes. We still hung on to that hope. Students, for today's assembly topic, we shall discuss personal health and hygiene. When you cough, you should cover your mouth. Otherwise, your saliva will be everywhere, the virus will be everywhere, and people everywhere will be infected. One will infect ten. Ten will infect hundreds. Finally, the whole country will be infected. This is what you call an epidemic. Currently, the most infectious virus is tuberculosis. Okay. Dismissed. Please return to your classes orderly. Your Math test is coming. To get a perfect score is easy. Let's do revision today. There are ten questions on the board. You must answer them, okay? Today we'll do the sum of even and odd numbers. It's very easy. Just keep practicing and practicing at home. Keep doing them... Okay, you will now take turns... Chew Seow Fang? Are you listening to me? She got all the sums correct. Very good! Eh? Where are your shoes? I was afraid to dirty my skirt. Towkay, here is the money I owe you. Sorry I still owe you some. I'll pay you another day. You are different from the rest. Here are two pencils for your kids. Thank you. Towkay, if there is a job no one wants to do you can recommend me. Wait! You! Wait! You! Hey stop! I gave you so many chances for your late coming to school. But still no improvement at all and you are getting worse! See! Your shoe is so wet! I'm sure you go and catch fish, right? No! Out! Out! Kun, the principal says you can return to school. Your shoes are torn. Give dad some time and I'll buy you a new pair. It's okay. I can still wear them. Bye, dad! Seow Fang, I'll definitely get you another pair of shoes. Here's the pen my teacher gave me. It's for you. Don't be upset, okay? Towkay, thanks for giving me this job. I'll give you $2 each day for delivery. If you are good, I'll let you learn how to drive and you can help me. Sure, I'll work hard! Hey, the bicycle is broken, so don't ride it! Okay! And one more thing... I know, Towkay! Let's go! Thank you! Thanks! Dad, look! A tip! You got one too? Yes! The towkay is right. These Caucasians are generous. Look, so many tips. Kun, now that dad has money I can buy you whatever you want! Dad, can you buy Seow Fang a pair of new shoes? Not just for Seow Fang. Yours have holes in them too. I'll buy you a pair as well. And your mom is about to give birth, we should buy her some health tonic as well. Come! Isn't this fun? It's fun! Oh dear! I know what's wrong with the bicycle! What's wrong? It has no brakes! Didn't I tell you the bicycle is broken? I repeatedly reminded you not to ride it! Towkay, I didn't know the bicycle didn't have brakes. Well, good thing you are okay. My bicycle is in this state because you didn't listen to me. I'll take it you bought it. I'll take $30 for the bicycle, plus what you owe me, that's $78. So you still owe me $45! Midwife! Oh no! Are you alright? You have to be careful with everything you do. If something happens to you your wife and children will be in trouble. Your wife is about to give birth. Like before I'll sit by my doorstep to keep watch. Once you wave this cloth I'll ride my bicycle over. Twenty minutes and I'll be here. Thank you, Midwife! You better take care of yourself! Hey, you dropped your pen! Thanks. Eh, you have new shoes? Yes! Where's your old pair? Torn. Threw them away. Huh? Threw them away? Where? At the village rubbish dump. Village rubbish dump? Seow Fang, look! Found it! My shoe! The other shoe must be around! Keep looking! Total suppression! Unfair retrenchment! Brother, let's go. Looks like they are about to fight. Okay. Seow Fang, look! Look over there! Your shoe! I'll go get it! Will it be dangerous? Should be okay. Be careful! I know. My friend, no matter how many people you send, we'll fight on and fear no obstacles! Seow Fang, don't be afraid! I'll kill you! Let's go! Your other shoe! It's here! No! My shoe! No! NO!!! The 1965 National Junior Cross Country Run is holding its selections. The best two students from each class will represent the school. Teacher, I think I'll embarrass the school. I think you are right. You better not embarrass the school. Teacher, I'm not feeling very well. Can I not take part? You are not well? Okay, then you don't have to run. Okay. Other than Kun, is there anyone else not well? No. Okay then. Get ready! Go! Go! Go! Don't embarrass me! Hey, want to go to the canteen for a drink? Come on! Do you need my help? My teacher told me today if I continue to wear your shoes I'll have to see the principal and ask dad and mom to come to school I have run out of excuses. Third Prize: A Pair of School Shoes Come in. Teacher, I want to represent the school in the National Junior Cross Country Run. The selection is over. You said you were ill that day? Teacher, this competition is very important to me. I have to take part in it. This competition is important to others too. If I let you run in it, it will be unfair to others. I can't. Teacher, I beg you! Please! Teacher, I beg you. Give me a chance! Take part next year! No! No! Teacher, Teacher, give me one more chance. I will run really fast! How many times must I tell you the selection is over. You can't take part in it! Now go home! One hot drink! Teacher, I beg you. Just let me take part in it! This run is very important to me! I said no. No means no! Teacher, please. I beg you! Teacher, what are you looking for? My medicine! Oh, your medicine... It's on the office table! I'll get it for you! You don't have to! I'll get it myself! Quick! Quick get my medicine! I'm representing the school in the National Junior Cross Country Run. Third prize is a pair of shoes. When I win them, you can have them. Are you sure you can get them? This is your salary. After deducting what you owe me, this is what you have left. Thanks, Towkay. It's not too bad. You are hardworking. Hardworking people earn money! Keep it up! In today's Cross Country Run, you'll meet the best in the country. But don't be intimidated because you are just as good. Save some strength for the last leg. Today will be a challenge for you to overcome the difficult path. The whole course is 5 km. The distance is not an issue, because I have confidence in all of you. It doesn't matter whether you win or lose. The important thing is to complete the run and not give up half way. Understand? Understand! Go change. For this competition, you are not wearing my shoes and I don't need you to do my homework. It's a fair game... Beng Soon, you are getting it wrong. I don't want to compete with you, I just... Enough said! We are standing at the start line and you tell me you don't want to compete with me? Do you know what you are saying? Seow Fang! Seow Fang! Mom, what is it? I'm going to give birth. Quickly go and wave the cloth! Call for the midwife! Hurry up! Okay! Okay! Auntie! Auntie! My mom is about to give birth! Come over! Come over! Auntie! Auntie! Auntie! Mom, the midwife looks like she's dead. She's not moving at all! Was it like this when you gave birth to us? I don't know why it hurts so much this time! Ouch! It hurts! Ouch! Why is it like this? Hey! My shoes! Hey! Third prize is a pair of shoes. When I win them, you can have them! Are you sure you can get them? Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! It hurts! Ouch! No tears in your eyes But a firm breathe of determination Despite the sweat and hardship There isn't a gasp of exhaustion The steps you take may be harder But our bond becomes stronger Innocently we carry on To wherever fate takes us We may have nothing But we will never think of submitting We may have nothing But we will never think of quitting No matter what lies in the path ahead No matter who holds the guiding hand As long as our hearts are together We have everything we need We may have nothing But we will never think of submitting We may have nothing But we will never think of quitting No matter what lies in the path ahead No matter who holds the guiding hand As long as our hearts are together We have everything we need Everything we need Come on! Come on! Lose it and we will have to buy new ones. Waste of money! Your shoes are huge. If I run too fast, they will slip off. Monday 7 am, report to me. Is that clear? Take the shoes! You want me to run faster, right? I have run out of excuses. You are out of my school! Third prize is a pair of shoes. When I win them, you can have them! Are you sure you can get them? Come on! Come on! You cycle very slowly. Hurry up! Slow? I walk even slower! Okay. Okay. Come on. Forget it. Come. Let's run! Hurry up! Quick! The 1965 National Junior Cross Country Run has come to an end! Third place goes to Nan Yi Primary, Tan Beng Soon! Second place goes to Nan Yi Primary, Mohammed Ali! Now for the champion! He is from Qing Hua Primary, Chew... Kiat... Kun! This pair of shoes must mean a lot, right? That's why I dug them out. I thought you guys wouldn't come. How can that be? We are friends! Yes! We are the best of friends! Don't be sad. I have a plan. Okay. Hey, don't just say okay, tell me! Hey, Beng Soon, winning the 3rd place is not bad already! Yes! We didn't even qualify for the run! Yes. Don't be sad! Beng Soon, don't be sad. Here. You can have the medal. I entered the run not to compete with you. Why give me the medal? I still lost to you! Why? Why can't we resolve our misunderstandings? Even when we are sincere, you don't believe us? I lost my sister's shoes so I joined this run to win a pair of shoes for her. That's it. Come. Push a little harder! Why is it so difficult with this child? Push harder, push! I can't. No, I can't! I can't. No, I can't! Push harder! Push! Help! I can't! I see it! I see the head! I can't! Push! Push a little harder! Come on! Wow! It's a boy! Congratulations! Hey! Yes, Towkay. Who is this for? For your wife after she gives birth! You didn't have to. Just take it! Thanks! Towkay! Brother, this pair of shoes cannot be worn anymore. What are we to do? Seow Fang, look! Hey, my shoes! Give them to me! Beng Soon! Beng Soon! My dad wants me to study in England. I'm here to say goodbye. I have too many pairs of shoes at home. I didn't understand what it is like without shoes. When your shoes are torn in the future, just go to my store. We are from the same village. Thanks, Beng Soon. We are grateful that Beng Soon eventually understood our problems. He didn't ask us to do any homework. As friends, we should help each other. That's why I told him to look me up if he needs help in the future! Yes! More people get things done faster! Being small can be helpful too! Goodbye! Even best friends will have arguments. After each argument, we cross our hearts and swear to ignore each other. But, each time, after a couple of days... sometimes, just after a couple of minutes, we become friends again. Putting the unhappy past behind us will always be better for all. Arguments are not completely bad. Just look at dad and mom. After each argument, they understand each other better and become more loving. What I admire most is they never fight. Not even once. We finally have our own shoes! Although they didn't come from dad, but from a friend we used to argue with, they come with greater meaning. Without our shoes, we could see our problem easily. Now that we have our shoes, can we still identify our problems?
