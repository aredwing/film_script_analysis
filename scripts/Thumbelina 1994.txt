I am Jacquimo... ...swallow extraordinaire and lover of beautiful things. You're sure to do impossible things If you follow your heart You're sure to fly on magical wings When you follow your heart Oh, that is very nice, n'est-ce pas? And I like what it is saying. It is saying, "Follow your heart and nothing is impossible!" You're sure to do impossible things Ha, ha! I love the sound of my voice! When you follow your heart When you follow Your heart I love great romances. I myself am a swallow of great passion. These are stories about people with impossible problems. Samson loved Delilah. Oh, that was really impossible. Romeo et Juliet, oh, impossible. But the most impossible of all the stories is impossibly small. The story of Thumbelina. Once upon a time, there was a lonely woman... ...who longed to have a child to call her own. One day she paid a visit to a good witch... ...who gave her a tiny barleycorn. "Plant it in a flowerpot," she says, "and see what happens." The woman did as she was told... ...and by and by it began growing. Until at last.... Oh, what a pretty flower! Hello, Mother. I will call you "Thumbelina." Thumbelina. But can you imagine the troubles for a little girl... ...no bigger than your thumb, hmm? Who is the girl no bigger Than a bumblebee? Who is the angel With a funny name? We don't know where she's from Or how she came to be But happy was the day she came Thumbelina She's a funny little squirt Thumbelina Tiny angel in a skirt Thumbelina First she's mending, then baking Pretending, she's making things up Thumbelina Who would believe the wonder Of the world I see? Each little minute brings a new surprise There's only one peculiar thing That bothers me Seems I'm the only one my size Thumbelina Think of all you'll save on meals Thumbelina Maybe if you had high heels Thumbelina If you stay here forever We know that we'll never be glum By gum Thumbelina She is always in the thick Thumbelina But I get out in the nick Thumbelina Fortune sometimes Has tricked us But this time it's picked us Oh, a plum's so big - A plum And a fig's so big And they call it a twig But a twig's so big It's a great big world Thumbelina That's me! Now, here's a story about the noble dog... ...who saved the king from the wicked wizard. Once upon a time-- - Oh, Mother, please. Are there any stories about little people? Well, as a matter of fact there are, Thumbelina. Look. They are little, just like me. But what are those? They're wings, Thumbelina. These are fairies, and fairies have wings so they can fly. Mother, have you ever seen a fairy? Well, I thought I did once. Really? - Yes. And here, the fairy prince and princess are having a wedding. And they live happily ever after. Oh, usually, dear. Hmm. I suppose it works best... ...if two people are about the same size. Yes, of course. Yes.... Well, that's not fair. I must be the only little person in the whole world. I wish I were big. Oh, no, Thumbelina. No. Don't ever wish to be anything but what you are. Bedtime, my dear. It's been a long day. You must go to sleep now. Sleep tight. Mother? Mm-hm? Would you please leave the book open? Of course, dear. I wanna look at the pictures while I go to sleep. There. Good night, Mother. Good night, Thumbelina. You take good care of her, Hero. Hmm. I know there's someone Somewhere Someone Who's sure to find me Soon After the rain goes There are rainbows I'll find my rainbow Soon Soon it won't be just pretend Soon a happy ending Love, can you hear me? If you're near me Sing your song Sure and strong And soon I wonder if there really are such things as fairies. Hmm. Oh, my dear. Don't look now, dear husband... ...but our son is missing again. So he is. I think he feels a bit silly, riding that white butterfly we gave him. Why should he feel silly? It makes the wrong impression on the young ladies. What about the impression on the court? Colbert, it is the autumn today and we've begun the golding of the leaves. He should be here. Tabitha. He'll hurt himself. I hope he's not out buzzing the vales on that wretched bee. He is the crown prince, for heaven's sake. Tabitha, dear, have you forgotten what it's like to be 16? Whoa. Oh! Hello! What a beautiful voice. I wonder who she is. Stay here, boy. I'll check this out. Oh. You have to go now? I see. You are a wonderful dancer. Will I ever see you again? May I cut in? Ah! No. Wait, wait. Come back. I apologize. I didn't mean to frighten you. Tsk-tsk-tsk. There. See? No more sword. Now, will you come out? Ah. Wait a minute. What are you staring at? Well, say something, will you? You're.... Oh! You're one of them. I beg your pardon? I thought I was the only one my size in the whole world. Hero, no. No, he's a friend. Look. Hello, my name is Thumbelina. How do you do, sir? Uh, thank you for coming to visit. Uh.... Oh. Oh. No trouble at all. The pleasure is mine. Sorry about that. Thumbelina. It's a lovely name. Thank you. I'm Cornelius. Cornelius? Well, that's a funny name. I mean it's perfect. Uh.... Tell me about the fairy court. Is there a prince? Yes. He must be terribly handsome. He is. Strong and brave. None like him. I would love to meet the prince. I'll tell him. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. What was that? Oh. That's Buzzby, my bumble. I left him on the sill. He doesn't like staying in one place too long. Why didn't you say something? Come on! Oh, my! He's amazing! Hey, would you like to go for a spin? Come on, let's go. I wish I had wings. Maybe someday you will. Hold on tight. Whoa! Let me be your wings Let me be your only love Let me take you far beyond the stars Let me be your wings Let me lift you high above Everything we're dreaming of Will soon be ours Anything that you desire Anything at all Every day I'll take you higher And I'll never let you fall Let me be your wings Leave behind the world you know For another world of wondrous things We'll see the universe And dance on Saturn's rings Fly with me and I will be your wings She's gonna marry the prince, huh, Mom?

Mama, I love her. Oh, Thumbelina. Oh, wow. Something.... I don't know.... Something happened to me tonight. Something I never wanna forget. Me too. Do not forget me. Forget-me-nots. I'll never forget you. Never. Never, never. - Cornelius. Oh, Mother. What--? Mother! - Cornelius, come now. - Who are those people? It's no time to explain. That's the queen of the fairies, my mother. Your mother? Yeah. Look, I must go now, but.... Can I see you tomorrow? Your mother? Then you're the.... You are the.... Tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow. Yes, I'm the prince. The prince? Yeah. Will you meet my parents? Cornelius! Say you will. I.... I will. You will? I will. I will, Prince Cornelius, yes. - Cornelius. - Cornelius. I've gotta go. Will they like me? Get down. Yes, they'll love you. But let me talk to them first. Tonight. And then I'll be back for you in the morning. Then you can meet my mother. Well, great. But, well, wait here. And then... ...we'll live happily ever after. Oh, much longer. Cornelius. Ooh! Goodbye. You won't forget to come back, will you? I promise. Whoa! Oh, Cornelius. Hmm. Gotcha!

But Cornelius loves me already. I think I'm gonna marry him. Marry him? That will be a very big mistake. It'll get in the way of your career in show business, doing those things domsticos. What things? The scrubbings and the washings And the noses with the drippings And the sopas always boiling The panes of windows falling With the diapers changing With the roof, she's leaking And the enchiladas spoiling Ooh.

Little one, are you having a bad day? I was sleeping on the windowsill, waiting for Prince Cornelius to come. He said he'd come because he loves me and-- He loves you? Yes. Congratulations! Thanks. But, well.... But I was stolen away by Mrs. Toad... ...who says I have to marry her son. A toad? That is a very bad day, Mademoiselle...? Thumbelina. Thumbelina, I am Jacquimo. How can I be of service to you? Well, I must get off this lily pad... ...but that's impossible. Ha-ha-ha! Nothing is impossible. Voil! Oh, my. Well, that was easy. Now if I can just reach the shore before those awful toads come back. Do you mean if you can reach the shore before you go over the waterfall? What waterfall? That one! Is it bad? I am slipping! Don't let go! Can you swim? No, I can't swim. I can't even float. Help! Help, please! Somebody help! Help! Somebody help! - Help! Jitterbugs, help! Pull, mes amis, pull! That is it. Higher, higher. What is it? Yeah. Who is it? Look, Mama, she's waking up. Are you feeling better, little one? Yes, I think so. Who are you? Thumbelina, these are the jitterbugs. The jitterbugs? How do you do? Are you really gonna marry the fairy prince? If he asks me. He will call for me at my house. That's why I wanna go home. Besides, mother will be terribly worried. If only I could find my way home. We'll help you, Thumbelina. Nobody will hurt you. Not with us on the job, right? Right. You are all very brave. Thank you. But I'm afraid I'll never see my home again. Oh. Do you love the prince? Yes. Then follow your heart. It will lead you home. Now, where does the prince live? He lives in the Vale of the Fairies. But I don't know where that is either. Do not worry.

And I'm going home. Cornelius, my sunshine, first you buzzed in here on that wretched thing... ...and announced before the court that you'd found the girl of your dreams. And now you come back to say she's vanished? Kidnapped. She's been kidnapped! You're joking! Tabitha. Please delay the winter frost as long as you can. I need time to find Thumbelina. - Cornelius! Don't worry, Mother, I'll be back. Cornelius! I'll find her! Oh, my poor boy. Colbert, my love, we can't delay the frost for more than a day. Hey, bro? Go away.

Thank you. Tomorrow is a new day. And I will go to the forest and see if I can find your Prince Cornelius. A nice sunny day, huh? It's sunny, all right, but I'm not too sure about the nice. I am looking for the Vale of the Fairies. Fairies? Beats the heck out of me. Why don't you ask a fairy? You know one? No, but he might. Excusez-moi, I am looking for the Vale of-- Am-scray! I can see you are a very busy fox, so I will be brief. Buzz off, buster! Look. Look what I do. I have a thorn in my wing. This is bad, very bad. Mon Dieu, I hope I still can fly. I fly. It only stings a little. Now, where was I? Autumn. It is Autumn. I must hurry to find the fairy prince. Winter is almost here. Thumbelina! Thumbelina, where are you? Whoa. Whoa! I'm looking for a beautiful young woman. Her name is Thumbelina. Are you the fairy prince? I am. Thumbelina's gone. Gone? Where did she go? The beetle took her away. What? They're out there. Somewhere. She's out there? In that? There's a big toad after her. Oh, no. I've got to find her. Winter's almost here. Hurry, Buzz! My father can't hold back the frost much longer. Okay, okay! Can I explain something? What? I don't know where she is. We didn't hit it off too good. So I let her go. She's not my type. She's an ugly type. I don't like ugly. She is beautiful! Whatever you say. Look, I got an idea. I hear that she loves the fairy prince, right? I crush fairy prince! Okay, shut up and listen. Why don't you just nab this prince and set up a trap for the girl... ...using him as the bait. You know, get her to come to you. Nab the prince? And set up a trap. Nab the prince. Yes. And set up a trap. Do you speak English? Try to keep up, Grundel, okay? Don't shout! You're making me very nervous. You go capture prince. You took my wings! You can't do that! Yeah? I keep wings until you nab prince. Listen, pal, this harassment has gone far enough, and I know my rights. I'll report you to the pond patrol. Okay, okay. Cool it, cool it. Where's your sense of humor? All right, I'll nab the prince. Come on, guys. Mind the wings. I'll be back. Excusez-moi, Monsieur Bear? I am looking for the Vale of the Fairies. I don't want no berries. No, no, no. Fairies, not berries. Wake up, you fat lummox! I said, wake up! I am having a very bad day. Mon Dieu, it is so cold. Winter! Winter is here. Oh-ho! This thorn.... It hurts to fly. Don't worry, Buzz. We're gonna make it. Thumbelina! Oh. Whoa! He takes my wings away. Now I have to walk to find the prince. If he let me keep my wings, I could fly after the prince. Hey, Beetle, this guy's the prince. The prince? Ah! The prince! Somebody up there loves me! Okay, you pick him up. Let's get out of this stinking weather before we're statistics. I can't even feel anything in my feelers anymore. A guy with my brains, I gotta talk to a toad. What kind of conversation can you have with a toad? What? They're toads. Jacquimo was wrong. I will never find my way home. It's impossible. Oh, Mother, where can you be? I know there's someone Somewhere Someone Who's sure to find her Soon After the rain goes There are rainbows She'll find the rainbow Soon Soon my breaking heart will mend Soon a happy ending Troubles behind her I will find her Homeward bound Safe and sound And soon Feeling better, my dear? Where am I? In my kitchen. I'm Ms. Fieldmouse and we are snug and safe underground. I'm underground? Yes, dearie, three feet under. I dug it myself with my own two hands. Here, drink this. At least that toad won't find me down here. There's something I don't understand. Did you really think you could survive the winter in that old shoe? Ha, ha! Honestly! I wanna go home. Well, I'm afraid you'll just have to wait here till spring, Thumbelina. You know my name! Oh, that was easy. I know much more. Like, you were engaged to the fairy prince. Cornelius, I believe? Well, almost. That is so sad. What? That he was found stone-cold frozen dead in the snow. But of course you knew that? No. Cornelius, no! - That is so sad. - No, it's not true. No! Oh, Thumbelina. Forgive me. Sometimes I just blurt things out without thinking. You're still young, though. There'll be another. He was perfect. Nobody's perfect. Cornelius was the only one-- Now, put this on. We'll take these corn cakes to Mr. Mole. He lives just down the tunnel. I'd rather not. I saved your life this very day and you'd rather not? Very well. One more thing... ...is it true that you have a beautiful voice? I don't feel much like singing. You must sing for Mr. Mole. He loves sweet things. Come on. Mr. Mole loves his corn cakes. Cornelius was looking for me. That's what must have happened. Good afternoon, Mr. Mole. Oh, yes. Ms. Fieldmouse? Good afternoon. Lovely day. I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Thumbelina. She just came down from up there. "Up there"? Up there. Terrible place. Mmm. How do you do, Miss Thumbelina? Pleased to make your acquaintance. How do you do, Mr. Mole? Come in. Don't touch anything. These are my things. We brought some corn cakes for you. Just you try one, Mr. Mole. Ooh. Mmm. Very nice. Well, tell us about up there. I went up once. Nearly blinded me. Hurried as fast as I could back down where it's dark and decent. Oh. Uh, but.... I love the light. I hate it. End of story. Story. Thumbelina, tell Mr. Mole a story. A lovely, sad story. Well.... Stand right there, where I can see you. Okay. Oh, I love love stories, don't you? Once upon a time, there was the sun. Sing it, Thumbelina. Sing. She sings? Shh! Oh. Um.... Once there was the sun Bright and warm and wonderful Shining like the love within my heart Now there's no more sun Winter has killed everything And although it's dark December Forever I'll remember sun Winter has killed everything, even the sun. Wonderful story. Dreadful thing, the sun. And now, I have a story to tell you. Just this morning, as I was out for my early morning stroll... ...I found the most extraordinary thing in my tunnel: A dead bird. - No! Yes. How do you suppose a dead bird got into my tunnel? Well, I'm certainly glad I'm not a bird. Bothering the world with endless twittering, twittering, twittering.... My, yes. Oh, there it is! Oh! Whatever do you suppose happened to him? Well, there's one less bird to twitter, twitter, twitter up there. Oh, Jacquimo. Jacquimo. My dear, dear friend. Tender little thing. Yes, quite lovely. Ms. Fieldmouse, could I have a word with you? I wish you would. You know I have been meaning to take a wife for some time now. What a lovely idea. I find myself sometimes, you know... ...lonely for companionship. What could be more natural? And I wonder if-- Yes? If I could ask you to help me persuade Miss Thumbelina... ...to be my wife? Thumbelina? She could keep me company and tell me stories. Yes. And for your service in helping to arrange this match... ...I will reward you handsomely. Oh! I will. I will! Dear Ms. Fieldmouse. Leave the arrangements to me. Thumbelina? I hear your heart. You're not dead, no. Jacquimo. Jacquimo. I'll come back. Tonight. - Thumbelina? One ice-cold prince coming up. Where do you want him? There. He looks dead. Dead? Dead, schmed! What difference does it make? You killed him. Okay, okay, have it your way. I killed him. There, you satisfied? Forget the prince, all right? What if I were to tell you I know where Thumbelina is right now? What if I told you that? Would you give me my wings? I'm glad you kill prince. It's a deal. Good. My sources tell me... ...she's buried alive with the mole. Mole? What mole? If I were you, I'd get my tail over there and save her. Go. Get hopping. Oh, and give me my wings. Where does mole live? I go kick down his door. Ooh! Ooh! Stop! Stop! What's going on? Where are we going? We go rescue Thumbelina from the mole. Mole? Are you out of your mind? I'm not going down there. Do you know what he does to beetles? Do you have any idea? He stuffs them. He stuffs them and he pins them on his walls. Quiet! Why don't you just marry a toad? Ever think about that? Find a pretty toad with warts and marry her. Quiet! Toads. I gotta be stuck with toads. They've got the fairy prince. We've gotta help him. Come on, guys, let's build a fire. All the same, we'll make it a thrilling wedding. Why, it's a wonderful match! Mr. Mole is the richest rodent for miles around. Educated, well-dressed, highly thought of.... Never mind that he can't see. That's all the better. How can I possibly marry Mr. Mole? I don't love him. Love? Love is what we read about in books, my dear. "Here Comes the Bride" Is a lovely little ditty But marrying for love Is a foolish thing to do 'Cause love won't pay the mortgage Or put porridge in your bowl Dearie, marry the mole True, it's a fact that he's not exactly witty He's blinder than a bat But at least his eyes are blue His breath may be alarming But he's charming for a troll Dearie, marry the mole Romeo and Juliet Were very much in love When they were wed They honored every vow So where are they now? They're dead, dead Very, very dead Poor Thumbelina Your brain's so itty-bitty I hate to seem a pest But I know what's best for you Just think of all the ways That you can decorate a hole Take my advice I'll bring the rice Dearie, marry the mole Marry the mole Marry that mole M is for money Oh L-E Please be warm, dear friend. Please live. Poor little swallow. I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. I know now... ...there's no place in this big world for little people. We.... We cannot do impossible things. Perhaps I should marry the mole. He could take care of me. He could. I will. I will marry the mole. You are joking? Jacquimo? Marry the prince. Jacquimo, you're awake! Oh, Jacquimo! Ow! Ow.
