I'm right here. - Mr. Binckley's all cleaned up? - Yes, he's fine. We're gonna have to talk to his family. He is really becoming chronic. No, you don't have to do that. I'm more than happy to take care of him. I know you are, Brandi, but you may not have much time to be spending on cases like Mr. Binckley anymore. What do you mean, Mrs. Petersen? I'm considering making you the new NA Captain. - The captain of the NAs? - Yes. - Would you be interested? - Yes. Very much. I've watched you with the residents and with the other nursing assistants and I like what I see. Of course, this is not an official offer, but I wanted you to be aware you are high on my list of possible captains. Thank you, Mrs. Petersen. I'll really try to do my best. I know you will. Then I can count on you coming in tomorrow? - Uh, Saturday? - I know what day it is, Brandi. Yes, of course, I know you do, but I came in last Saturday. Oh, I see. But, no, no, no. I can come in. It's fine. It's no problem. Good, that's what I'm looking for. Now, don't let me keep you. Thank you, Mrs. Petersen. Thank you a lot. I'm just doing my job. And I'm just asking for another week. A couple of days even? This ain't a charity ward. Just another day. I've got a job interview. You vacate or I call the cops. Your choice. My choice? What are you doing? Making my choice. Uh-uh. You don't take anything. What? You pay or your stuff stays. Listen, I've got a job interview. Can't I at least get my good clothes? All right, all right, go ahead. I'll wait. - You'll wait? - I'll wait. I'll be right back. Hey! What the hell are you two doing? Yeah, well, shove it! I don't need it, all right? Fucking asshole! Shut your mouth. Get back in your room or I'm calling the cops. - All right, that's it. You're out of here. Come on. What the hell have I got to put up with this shit for? Fucking asshole! Get in here right away.

Bradeau. Thomas Bradeau? Bardo. Thomas Bardo. This way. Take a seat. Hi, I'm Thomas Bardo. Sorry about the clothes. And how do you spell your name? B- A-R-D-O. Yeah, you'll probably see that I was a project manager. Very challenging job, but my company decided to downsize just before my benefits kicked in. You know how that is. Then the unemployment ran out. I thought I might have better luck in the city... but... You know how that goes. You know, I can't seem to find you in the computer. Oh? All right, you take that, fill it out, and mail it in. I've already filled this out. Well, you can't be in the computer until you fill it out and mail it in. But I've already mailed this in. That's how I got the appointment. Well, you can't have an appointment until you're in the computer. But I have an appointment, it was at 1:00, and I've been waiting for three and a half hours. But you're not in the computer. - But... - You're not in the computer. So you fill out the 976, you mail it in to me and I will make sure you get an appointment. Look, Mr. Lieber, this hasn't been a good day for me, you know. Can't you just take my word that I've already sent this in or put me in now... Sir, look, if you're willing to follow procedures, we can work with you. If not... It's your choice. Well, I guess I'd better fill this out, huh? That's the procedure. Hey, girl. Hey. - What are you so happy about? - Happy? Yeah, you look like the cat that got the canary. I got some possible good news. Oh, yeah? What? I could use some right about now. - I don't want to say. - Why not? I don't want to jinx it. - Jinx it? - Yeah. I'll let you know. Whatever, girl. You going to HighLow tonight? - Yeah, of course. - That's what I'm talking about. T.G.I.F. - Except I've got to work tomorrow. - You do? - Yeah. - Why? Petersen needed someone. Oh, my God. Christ, girl, you're gonna make us all look bad. You should just tell Petersen that she needs to get her fat ass in here and she needs... Oh, my... - See you tomorrow, then? - Yes. Yes. And, um, Tanya? I will be coming in on Saturday. Oh! Um... Are you needing anyone to work tomorrow? As a matter of fact, I do. - Should I put you down for tomorrow? - Sure. Fine. We'll see you both tomorrow, then. - Oh, my God. - You're busted. You're busted. - Thank you, ma'am. - Mmm-hmm. She's like a fucking ghost! - I can't believe you said that. - Oh, my God. Shit, man. - You think Rashid's gonna be there tonight? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you think he's gonna have any good X? He's Rashid. Cool, man, because I could really use some tonight, girl. I really, really could. Don't know whether to ask you for money or give you some. After the day I've had, I'll take whatever I can get. I got just what you need. - What is it? - Hey.

What the fuck is wrong with you? - What are you doing? - What am I doing? I'm not doing anything. You are. You're doing it. You started it and now you're finishing it. What? You broke in. You're crazy. You wanted to steal my car. But Rashid found you and he fought you. He broke your leg, but you kept fighting and you killed him. And then you got this gas. You got this gas to burn Rashid's body but the fire got out of control and it burned you and the car and the garage and everything! You did it! You did all of it! Help me. Help me, please. Help me. - Help you? - Help me. Please? No. Help me, please. Why didn't you help me? I don't know. Why didn't you let me go? I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, don't do it. Please! Please. Please. Please don't do it. Pedro! Pedro! Somebody in there.
