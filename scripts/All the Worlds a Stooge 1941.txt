Well, we soon gonna hear the patter of baby feet around the house. Let me be the first in congratulate you. Thanks. I've just been awarded a refugee. A little waif from the war-torn battlefields of... somewhere. Isn't it splendid? I can't imagine anything more intriguing, madam. Ow, my tooth is killing me. Not now, Ajax, you must have that tooth attended to. I want you in a good humor when our refugee arrives. - Refugee? - Yes, of course. Isn't it wonderful? Everybody's doing it, dear. It's really quite the thing socially. Dogs and cats aren't enough. Now we have a haven for refugees! - Now look at me! - I haven't time. Now you must go get that tooth pulled while I go fix the nursery for our little refugee. Refugee. Me dying with a toothache. - Heave! - Oh! - Heave! - Oh! - Heave! - Ho! - Heave! - Ho! - Heave! - Ho! Heave! You nitwit! You're supposed to be washing windows, not taking dives off the scaffold! Get up, Sleeping Beauty! You've been on your back since we got the job! Come on! Follow me! I'm the boss, and I want you to stop falling off to the scaffold. Can I have something for born dizzy? I'll dizzy you. I didn't do nothing. That's why I slugged you. Do something. Get the water and wash that window, right now! We're sorry, Doc. You idiots! Just look how you turn off my office! Oh, we'll clean the place up. When I came back, I'll clean you up! - Hurry! - Quiet! We'll probably get fired for this! Get in here and clean up this mess! Hurry up! Come on. Come on, make everything spink and spank. And get that other spot too. Oh, this tooth is killing me. You have to pull it, Doc. You'll have to ome back later, buddy. - The dentist... - Later nothing. Get busy and pull this tooth. Go on, pull it. Go ahead, Doc. Take a chance. What do you got to lose? Okay, buddy. It's your tooth. And give me an anesthetic. - Annie who? - Anesthetic. He means he wants to be knocked out. Oh, a pleasure. He's out. You imbecile. You knock him out before he told us what tooth to pull. Don't worry. I'll afford it. Move over, Doc. That's it. Boy, you should have been a surveyor. Oh, thanks. I bet you tell that to all your interns. I... This is your fault. Go on, hold on him like I told you! Hey Nijinsky, give me those clickers. Now go on, hold on the man! Hey, after all I'm the sturgeon. Give me a little room! I think I got something. - Funny, eh? - Yeah. Now laugh this off. Go on, hold onto him, so I can pull that tooth. Nothing doing. From now on you do the hold on and I'll do the pulling. I hope you know what you're doing. Give him a servillette. I'll show you how to jerk a tooth. Hey, what's the idea of the glasses? I can't see without the glasses. That's only in your mind. I'll prove it to you. Here. How many teeth in his mouth? Four. You're crazy. He's got a mouthful. See? I told you, I need the glasses. - See those teeth? - What teeth? Go on, get busy. I can pull it blindfolded. Hey fellas, I got a bite! Pull away! Oh, stubborn, eh? I got it! An octopus. You stripped his gears. Now we have got a problem. Wait a minute. Here's some cement. We'll put his choppers back before he wakes up. Hold this. Oh, jumping beans. That ought to be enough. Bring me those ivories so I can put them back. Put them back alive. Hey, the cement's hardened. What do we gonna do now? Wait a minute. Maybe you can drill it out with this. What do you mean, "maybe"? We ain't getting no place fast. Think we'll have to blast. Boy, that's an idea. Let's get some powder. Either you fire those janitors or I'll move. They're fired! Hey, what are you doing? Are you all right, Mr. Bullion? Yeah, feels fine, Doc. Gee, thanks. Send me your bill. Come back here you guys! Hey, what are you fellas doing in my car? We just escaped from a scaffold. - Fugitives, eh? - Now wait a minute. He means we're refugees. - Refugees? - Yeah, that's it. How would you boys like a nice home? Home, James! Come on. Not a bad joint. Remember, you're supposed to be children, just three dumb kids. We get you, boss. - Hey, I relent that. - You relent what? He called us "children". Act your age. - Leave him alone! - Quiet. Oh, a Jack the Ripper, eh? Hitting little girls? Yeah. I have a surprise for you, dear. Don't tell me you brought me my little refugee? Three of them. - Where are they? - Children. This is Johnny, Frankie and Mabel. They're precious. Children, meet your new mammy. Who darned our socks and washed our shirts when we were helpless, little squirts? Mammy! Who kept the buttons on our clothes? Who scrubbed our ears and blew our nose? Mammy! Oh, mammy, it's your little boy, Sammy, coming home from Alabamy. Put on those eggs and hammy. Don't flimflam me, mammy. Mammy. Mammy. Oh, mammy! Are you hurt, dear? Oh, mammy. A luncheon is served, madam. Eats! Come on! Oh, I'm sorry, darling. Very sorry. You nitwit. What would Emily Post say? Come and get it. Well, that's that. Hey, where's the dessert? Eat your spinach, children. - Here, eat your spinach. - I don't like spinach! Why, you gonna eat it whether you like it or not. Where are my cigars? I bought a new box yesterday. You're smoking too much, dear. I'm smoking too much? What... Say, where are those refugees? The little darlings. They're upstairs playing games with the butler. - Come on, seven! - Roll those bones! Frankie needs a pair of shoes. - Give me. - Children! Wait. Quick, hide the cigars. Wait a minute. Here. Under here. There, there, children. - You may go back there. - Yes, madam. You've played long enough. It's getting quite late. - That's a coincidence. - Yes, isn't it? Now, children, I'll give you a milk, so you get undressed and get ready for bed. Oh, no, not us. We sleep with our clothes on. Last time I took mine off, I caught cold. Oh, the idea. It's getting warm in here. - Wait! Hold still! - What's going on here? Quick, get some water! Take it easy, sister. Roll her up in this. Come on. There we are. Take it easy in there. You're as snug as a bug in a rug. Here's the water. - Get it in there, boys. - Hold it. That's cold! Hello down there! Are you out? Yes, she says she's out! Quick, get down! Ready? Heave! I know you're just all dying to see my little refugees. How are the precious darlings? They're fine, except Frankie. He has a little cold. The butler will bring them all down later. How did that applehead get a cold? He slept with his feet hanging out the window last night. He would. What are you doing? I got a cold. Mommy said I should soak my feet. She didn't tell you you soak with your shoes on, did she? Now look what you did! How will I get rid of my cold? Put some on that salve on your chest and come right downstairs! Make it snappy. I believe I'm starting to smell a little bit. Oh, here's one of the children now. Oh, Frankie, kid, I want you to meet all my guests. He's cute. Can you recite something, Frankie? Please do, Frankie. Little fly upon a wall... ain't you got no clothes at all? Ain't you got no shimmy shirt? Ain't you got no petty skirt? Boo, fly, ain't you cold? You're just as cute as you can be. You're not bad yourself. Wouldn't you like to go and meet some of the other guests? No, I like it here. Frankie, come over here. No, I don't want to. Don't worry, I won't leave you. Why, Frankie, what's the matter? I just got a stabbing pain. What's the matter? You got a cold too? No. How's your cold? Pretty good, but I still don't smell so good. I'll say you don't. - Mommy! -Johnny, come back here! - Hey mommy! Mommy! - Come back here! Hello, folks. I was just... playing with the children. Yeah, let's play some more! He got him!
