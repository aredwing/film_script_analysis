A word, please, Minister! Look this way, please! - Thats another story. - Right. Can we get an interview, please? Minister, a word, please! Whats that?! Youre Minister of Justice Sellers, correct? - Go after her! - Oh my God! Stop her! Get off of me! GET OFF OF ME! The terrorists name is Cammy White. A special agent who belongs to MI6. Shes being interrogated at B Base... but she has no memory of the past 3 years. What do you mean? It seems like her mind is being controlled. By using Cammys analysis data, we should be able to figure out... how Shadowlaw is creating terrorists with special abilities. We also know that Shadowlaw is gathering info... on street fighters around the world to create weapons like Cammy. Turning street fighters into terrorists, huh... This man is a fighter named Sagat. He is admired as a muay thai champion and a hero in Thailand. This is Bison, exiled from the boxing world due to his savagery. This is Balrog, a Spanish fighter feared as Crazy Viper. These three are now members of Shadowlaw... as combat personnel under Vega. Shadowlaws crimes are increasing in size year by year. We need to destroy them immediately. I think its time we carry out an investigation with the US military. Patterson Air Force Base Major Guile! People from Interpol are here to see you. Interpol? Im Chun-Li. What do you want? Weve come to have a meeting on joint investigation on Shadowlaw. Ill defeat Vega. What do you mean? I dont need help defeating Vega. Major Guile, this is a decision made by the military! We just need to defeat Vega, right? Well, good luck to you, too. - Ive been waiting for you. - Hurry up and show me. Right away, sir. This is the newly revamped monitor cyborg with... super performance computer equipped. Images captured by this monitor cyborg will be sent instantly to... the super computer at headquarters via satellite communication. Its already been arranged to replace the old monitor robots with these. Good. By the way, have you found him? Not yet, sir. How can you not find a man so strong he defeated Sagat? Weve been tracking info on fighters from all over... I wonder if this man named Ryu really can be such a strong fighter. This was recorded by the computer. potential combat capacity. But 3600? I can hardly believe it. At any rate, youll have to find Ryu as soon as possible! I dont care if its on top of the Himalayas. Send cyborgs out! Ryu, what do you see lying ahead of your fists? Thats good for now. Get some rest. Before breakfast, lets go to the valley to get some water. OK! You bastard! Why did you pull your punches?! Did you go easy on me? Idiot! I dont go easy on you! Ill never understand you. Thats fine. Someday, therell be time when we seriously have to fight each other. Seattle Sorry that Im late. Its not usual for you to be late, Ken. My opponent was harder I expected, and it took longer than I thought. And how did it go? Of course I won. So you added another title to your name. Yeah. Suzhou, China Hey, is Fei Long not here yet? We cant shoot a movie without the leading man. Strange. He shouldve headed here already. This happens every time. Give me a break... - Hey, Fei Long. - Whats going on? Just some entertainment. Entertainment? Some young man in the audience is being dragged to the ring. I didnt say anything! I heard you muttering to yourself while watching the show. You must be pretty tough, talking like that. Hm, interesting. Such a big star, yet you still like to fight in places like this. That guy doesnt look so bad. Little brat... Nice one. Can I challenge you now? You look like some fighter. Whats your name? My name is Ryu. Im just a Japanese traveler. I have no intention to fight. Not yet! Its not over yet! Ill show you my special! Get ready! - I cant believee this! - Did he just get beaten? Now I remember! Ryu! A few years ago, there was a fighter who defeated... the muay thai champion, Sagat, and went missing. I think he was Japanese and the name was Ryu. Are you that Ryu? I heard Sagat is now in Shadowlaw training himself. Shadowlaw? Whats that? - You dont know? - No. Its a crime syndicate thats spreading... weaponry and drugs all over the world. Sagat...is in a crime syndicate... Ryu...well meet again. Northern Seattle Fight, Ken! Ive come here to fight you! You dont get it, do you? I dont street fight anymore! It doesnt matter where a fighter fights. Nonsense. Whats the point in fighting on the street like this? You have honorable titles as a fighter. Defeating such a man is an honor to another fighter! Thats what I call nonsense! Plus, you cant defeat me. No matter who comes at me, no one can defeat me... except for Ryu. Ryu? That vagabond fighter that went missing? Dont compare me with someone like him! I see. I guess youre not that bad. I like it! Whats wrong? Why do you not finish me? Ryu, where are you? Come settle the fight soon! Calcutta Are you all right? Oh no... I see. Your mothers ill. Im sorry. Can you buy it again with this? Here. Damn you...! Whats this...? My body wont...move... I feel a powerful aura. Hes strong. - Come on! - Whats going on?! - Fight! - Hurry up and fight! - Dhalsim! - Fight! Wait! Ill let you win this fight. What do you mean, let me win?! I felt someone powerful behind me. Are you going to forfeit the match with that nonsense?! No. I concede the fight. Then Ill take the prize. Yeah. Whats wrong?! Ive never felt such strong fighting power before. - Whats going on? - He stopped fighting? Damn it! Are you all right?! - Who are those guys? - Terrorists from Shadowlaw. Shadowlaw? - Leftover money... - Yeah, I got it. Thank you. Yo! Half of this money is yours. - Money? - I mightve lost without you. Take it. Were both Japanese. Dont be humble! Are you sure you erased Jahan? Yes, I am sure. At the scene, the monitor cyborg found an unknown fighter. - Were investigating him now. - Anything else? The cyborg in Seattle sent us some interesting data. Id like you to see it as well. Ill be right there. I hope your info was worth my trip here. Yes. Take a look at this. This man has some skill, but we found something intriguing. I compared him against Ryus image. Whos this guy? Ken Masters. The command center pc has data of his title matches. But we didnt realize his relation to Ryu. What do you mean? Ken and Ryu trained under the same master for over 10 years in Japan. Their fighting skills are roughly equal. Equal? The potential fighting capacity is different. We havent acquired current data on Ryu, but possibly... a bug in the system or Ryu hasnt... been able to utilize his capacity. Ryus fellow pupil... It might be interesting to use him as a weapon... for Plan P. General, American President Ed Pressman is... a strong promoter of arms control legislation... so hes heavily guarded. We need him out of the way, but it must be done carefully. If we train him with my Psycho Power, itll work out. But...the Cammy incident... Cammy achieved our objective. Shes being interrogated at Interpol. I dont care. Her job is done. Leave her be. Weve received interrogation footage of Cammy at Interpol. Let me see it. We know that youre an MI6 agent. I dont remember. We dont know why an MI6 agent such as yourself... assassinated the Minister of Justice... by the command of Shadowlaw. I dont remember. Cammy, your mind was being controlled. Wed like to at least get a clue... as to how and where you were controlled. Try to remember. I dont remember. Leave her be. Some measly Interpol system is no match for my Psycho Power. But if we leave her be... Well take care of her in time. More importantly, do not slack on finding Ryu. No matter what, bring him to me. Understood, sir. On another note, would you like to order the capture of Ken? No need. Its fun to trap a man like that. Whats all this? Investigating on your own is against the rules. Youre nosy, lady. If youre not gonna move, Ill just run you over. Go ahead. Major Guile, Im sorry your best friend was killed by Vega. Is it also Interpols job to pry into the private lives of others? Im sorry to intrude, but I read your file. Vega is no longer just your target to avenge your best friend. Standing here talking wont stop Vega. Then try me out and see if Im all talk? I dont have time to play! Vega is also my target. To avenge my father... But...Im an Interpol agent! Annihilation of Shadowlaw comes before my private grudges. Major Guile... if you have pride as a member of the Air Force... lend us your help! I dont like a woman who talks too much. Are you coming or not? Of course, Im coming! Los Angeles Why is there a monitor cyborg at a nightclub? Some fighter named Dee Jay is there. You idiots dont get my music. Go home. Bastard...! I didnt do anything! There! Im Major Guile, Air Force. What does Major Guile of the Air Force want? Youre my fan? Youve been marked by Shadowlaw. Shadowlaw as in the scary organization? Oh, the horror! Im not kidding. Fall in with them, and you wont be playing anymore. I was kidding. Why would Shadowlaw mark a guy like me? Theyre gathering info on each and every notable fighter. - That doesnt concern me! - Yes, it does. Your data has already been sent to Shadowlaw by this. Whats this monster? Some kind of creepy doll? Its a monitor cyborg. It gathers information for Shadowlaws supercomputer. A lot of these are roaming around. Watch out, and tell your friends. Guile, huh... I see hes cooperating with Interpol to try to stop me. What do you say, Balrog? Would you like to have fun... with this agent, Chun-Li? Shes beautiful, isnt she? An agent trying to avenge her father... Dont you think its admirable, Balrog? Patch me to Las Vegas. Las Vegas Here you are. Most of the bosses in charge of their trafficking routes are here. Itll be OK. Right. Contact the command center? Understood. That investigation has been troublesome lately. Our upcoming transaction will go smoothly, right? Its been taken care of. Could you tell the General to contact me once? Will do. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting. The show is about to begin. Please proceed to the hall. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting. Let me introduce the fighters competing today. Emperor of the Russian wrestling world... The man with a steel body... Zangief! His opponent is... a man of unusual origins. He learned to fight beasts in the depths of the jungle... Blanka! Ouch! New York Strange... She said she was going back to her room earlier. Damn it! Im in a hurry... Youre...Balrog! This is strange. I have a bad feeling about this. Pick it up! Whats that?! Chun-Li! Slowly skinning a cornered rabbit...thats what I like. This also loves to suck the blood of especially cute rabbits. My...my beautiful face...! Ill kill you! God damn it... Chun-Li! Are you OK, Chun-Li?! - It was Balrog. - What?! Chun-Li! Chun-Li! Chun-Li! Then what happened to Balrog? He was handed over to the NYPD?! Were currently tracking monitor cyborgs here. Theyve been spotted around Ken Masters... winner of the National Fighters Championship. He lives in Seattle. Yes. Unlike no-name street fighters... hes got skills. Im sure Vega will approach him. Were also investigating Ryu, who trained with Ken. Weve heard that a fighter who headed for Thailand... from India seems to fit his profile. OK. You track down that guy, Ryu, as well. Im worried about Chun-Li... Ill wait here at the hospital for a little bit longer. As soon as things are settled here, Ill go meet Ken in Seattle. Please have Kens file ready. Lake Washington Eliza... You wanna get married? What is this all of a sudden? You dont want to? Thats not what I mean. Youve neveer talked about anything like this before. Then why not? But... But...? Its not like you. Did something happen? Nothing special... Ken! Ken, you ARE acting unusual today. Sorry. Thank you. What you said before...I accept. - Eliza... - I love you. Call me later. Ryu, Im tired of waiting for you... General, the targets car is in sight. Good. Move in closer. Bastard! What the hell?! Youre Ken Masters, right? Ive come to pick you up. Pick me up?! Who are you?! Im Vega, the General of Shadowlaw. Vega? Never heard of you. What do you want? Ill turn you into a strong fighter. Creepy old man. Go away! I will turn you into a fighter stronger than Ryu! Ryu? You know Ryu?! The name Ryu gets you serious, huh? Shut up! Its none of your business! You monster! What are you gonna do with me?! Using some weird move... No use fighting against Psycho Power. Psycho Power? Ken, do not resist. Obey me. Shut up! Ken, obey me. Who would obey a monster! You dont understand, do you? Youre really something. Im looking forward to growing you. What does it mean for you to come all the way to see Ken Masters? Kens been marked by Vega. - Is this Kens car? - Yes, no doubt. Were too late. New York Branch of Interpol Regarding the locations of Shadowlaw branches and monitor cyborgs... no bases have been spotted around Seattle except for warehouses. If Ken has been taken... it would be to where the other fighters were trained by Vega. Do we have any info on such bases? We havent been able to locate their training facility yet... but their large command center bases are located in East Asia. Major Guile... speaking of East Asia, we found the location of Ryu... Kens fellow pupil. Thats the man who was in India. Where is he? In the mountains near the Laotian border, on the Thai side. Are there monitor cyborgs in place around Ryu? Yes. Weve caught some... but Ryu has been moving around through China, India, Thailand... and the objective of these movements is unknown... so it doesnt look like specific cyborgs are tracking him. According to our data, Ryu possesses the same skill leveel as Ken. Theres no reason why Vega would leave him be. Well approach him first and try to disrupt his contact with Shadowlaw. How is the military/Interpol joint plan to stop Shadowlaw progressing? Weve already located most of their large bases. We start from East Asia, especially the command center near the Cambodian border... Weve planned a large scale attack on it by our special forces. Chun-Li... Weve finally located Vegas main base. Ill avenge you and your father with my own hands. You probably want to do it yourself... but this time, let me handle it while you rest. Im going now. Ken... I see the source of your power is your rivalry against Ryu. Very well. Let me enhance that rivalry with my Psycho Power. Ryu, are you OK? Yeah, I am. Thank you. Another one! Major Guile. Were nearing the mountains at the Laotian bprder. OK. General Vega. We just received word that a military helicopter... with Guile on board is nearing the Laotian border. Looks like theyve located Ryu. Guiles going to Ryu? Theyre trying to beat me to the punch. Lets take Ken and go see them. But Ken isnt completely... Thats fine. Im just going to let them have a fatal match... Then Ill come back with Ryu. Get things ready right away. Yes, sir. General, let me fight Ryu. Sagat, youre an important fighter for Shadowlaw. Forget that old grudge with Ryu. But if I dont fight him again, my honor... The honor of a fighter... Meaningless. Your enemy is now the whole world. But...! Sagat, Shadowlaws rules state that you are not to disobey me! You know very well. I have another order for you. Go to New York right away and clean up Balrog and Cammy. In Shadowlaw, you are not to fail executing my plans, either. Thailand, in the mountains Hey Ryu, why dont we take a break and have some tea? Sure. Looks like its going to rain. Whats that? Ryu, look. Someones coming. Odd to get visitors way out here. Are you Ken Masters friend, Ryu? Yeah. Who are you? Major Guile, US Air Force. Did something happen to Ken?! Hes been kidnapped by a crime syndicate called Shadowlaw. Kens been kidnapped by Shadowlaw?! Hell be used to carry out terrorism. Ken would neveer lend a hand to a crime syndicate. Theyve brainwashed him. Kens become a terrorist... - Vegas personal aircraft! - What?! So many guests today... And a rude one at that. Ken! You finally showed up, Vega. Its been a while, Major Guile. We have all the actors, and the setting is perfect. You...! What are you gonna do with Ken?! Ah, you must be Ryu! Ken became a Shadowlaw fighter in place of you. You bastard! Let Ken go! Ryu! Ken! How do you like it, Ryu? The current Ken is a killing machine that I have created. Will you be able to defeat him? Ken, its me, Ryu! Im sorry, but he cant hear his best friends voice right now. He is a machine whose sole purpose is defeating you. Ken, snap out of it! Vega, I cant let criminal scum like you run rampant! Sense of justice, huh... Guile, an evil mind is the source of all power. Ken here will prove that. Beating him is faster than listening to his damn speech. Here I come! Who are you? Ill be your opponent! Guile, why dont you try to see if you can defeat me? Youll get your wish. Ken, its me. Snap out of it! Ken! Its me, Ryu! Snap out of it, Ken! Whats wrong? Dont you want to avenge your friend? Come at me! I wont fall for the same move! Too easy! Oh no! Wait... Its not over...yet... Ken, wake up! I dont want to fight you like this. Snap out of it! Ken... Ken, its me, Ryu! Look at me, Ken! Ryu... Ken... Loser... STOP! Ken! Get out of my way! Youre going to fight me? Interesting. Let me see how good you are. Shut up and get out of my way! Quit talking and defeat me. Then you can go to your friend. Move away! Im going now. Yeah. Take care. Ill be leaving here in a few days as well. When we meet again... When we see each other next time... Ill be looking forward to it. You piece of...! Ryu, how about it? You, too, obey me and become a chosen fighter of Shadowlaw. Cut the crap! I will never be your lackey! You still have strength to resist me? - Impressive. - Shut up! Fool. I take it youre going? Yes. I will miss you! You will someday face someone you must defeat beyond a match. Training means moving forward toward that day. Beyond a match...? Master, what do you mean, beyond a match?! Master! I will tell you! What was that? What happened? I cant remember... Whats happened to my body?! Damn it... Thats... I get it. Thats the aircraft that monster was on... I remember now. Ryu! Thats him! Vega! Ryu! My body...! Control your breathing and mind, and cultivate energy into spirit... Cultivate energy into spirit... Cultivate spirit into body... Cultivate god to obtain the way... Stand up straight as if my head is being pulled from above... Calm the mind and relax the back... Concentrate, relax the hip... Put my weight on one leg... Relax the shoulders and arms... Focus my consciousness... Harmonize the top and bottom... Keep the arms and legs moving... Find peace in the movements... Outside are the shapes... Inside are the meridians... Cultivate spirit with the breath... - Yin and yang reach the limit... - Make the body like steel... Create the four elements. Push the elements to their limit... Form the eight symbpls... When it reaches the limit of rigidness... it becomes soft... When it reaches the limit of softness... it becomes rigid... Ken! Its all about what you see beyond your fists. Ken, wake up! Ryu... Whats wrong? Show your power! Ken! Ryu, we finally meet again. Ill greet you later. - First, we stop this creep! - Yeah! You really want to fight me no matter what. Very well. Ill be your opponent in battle. Come! Ah, you were able to hit me. Youre as good as I expected. Come at me harder! Whats wrong? More! More! Show me more! Even if its brief, you shook me up. This man, Ryu... Vega! Ken, now! This is it! - Is this Guile? - Yeah. This is New York Central Hospital calling. Please come to the hospital right away. Chun-Li! Watch out, you idiot! Chun-Li! Chun-Li... Your father is avenged, as promised. I know. Joint Interpol/US military operation to destroy Shadowlaw succeeds! Yay, Guile! - You brat! - Sorry! I wont forgive you! - Sorry! - You little brat! Ryu, next time we see each other, well finish our match. Yeah. You want a ride? Nah, Ill walk. Where are you going now? I dont know yet. Ryu, youve become strong. You, too. See you!
