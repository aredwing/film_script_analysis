She says that because|of the system of racism... ...he's been made|to think of himself as a baby... ...a not-yet fully formed being who|hasn't realized his full potential. To support her claim,|she offers the following: First off... ...what does a black man|call his woman? Mama. Second, what does a black man|call his closest acquaintances? His boys. And finally, what does a black man|call his place of residence? The crib. No! I don 't want to lose my baby! Baby! Come on, babe. You all right? We'll go straight home, okay? Jody! Baby, come on. Just take it easy, okay?|Just get in. Take it easy, baby. Baby? Yvette? You going to sleep? Are you hungry? I'll go to Lucy's and get you a cheese|enchilada and a strawberry shake. That'd make you feel better. I'm fine, Jody. You don't need Daddy|to be here for you? I'm just trying to take care of you. Seems like you already done that. Leave me alone, Jody.|Just get out of my face. Then I guess you don't mind|if I use your car, huh? Since you're going to sleep. What's up, little homie? What's going down with you? Get the hell home. Peanut? Why are you screaming?|I'm hungry. Fix me some food. You gonna give me some love? Hey, Ms. Herron.|How's Daddy's little girl doing? Look at you. Suckie-suckie, now.|Come on. How's Daddy's little baby? -Jody, you're parked in the driveway.|-Sorry. I'll move it. Least you can do|is wash mine before you leave. I got it.|Say, "Daddy got it, Grandma. Daddy got it all under control." Look at my pretty baby. One thing I know how to do|is make some pretty babies. That's my baby.|That's my little girl. When will you say "Daddy"?|You want to go to Disneyland? That's my baby. Sleep, sleep, sleep. Go on and pull the damage out. What you doing to the backyard, Mama? I told you I was starting a garden. You've said that for the longest. I must be getting old. I'm doing the|same things I seen my mama do. I'm planting collards,|mustard greens... ...and all this over here|will be my corn. Tomatoes. Then I'll get|a lace awning at Home Depot... ...so I can sit here, tune you out and|sip my wine while my tomatoes grow. My cabbage is over there.|My beans, onions and sage. How's Yvette? She's all right. Sleeping. I can't give you money|every time you get a girl pregnant. I know, Mama. This is Melvin.|He's helping me with my new garden. He owns a landscaping business. Maybe you can work for him|and make some money. Your mama told me you got a problem|finding a job. I know how that is. I had that problem too,|before I got my own business. I'll take these back to the truck. I'm gonna see you later? I hope so. So you got a new boyfriend now? Mama gotta have a life too. I'm trying to get money. That's all I'm about. I desire sleep. -Hey, homie. Want some weed?|-No, man. I'm cool. I ain't gonna make no money here.|There's too many weed mans. Let's go holler at these hos. How's moms doing? She cool.|I think she got a new boyfriend. Some old thug-ass nigga. I know she'll want to kick me out. He'll want to lay up in the house,|move me out so he can get at Mama. Next thing you know,|he'll be goin' upside her head. Ain't that the way it go? Why are you still with him?|You're always at the clinic. It ain't Jody's fault.|It take two. I stopped taking my pills. There you go blaming yourself again. How many times do you call on|the phone about his ass? Cut him loose. I don 't care|if you got a baby. He don 't own you. Look, Jody don't put his hands on me,|no matter how mad he get. He ain't crazy. Bitch, how long you been with Chris?|Three years? How many times has that nigga gone|upside your head? How's your eye feel? It's all right. It's all right. Shit. At least we living together. He just want to play with your life|and string you along. He with his other baby's mama|when he ain't with you. Please believe. He don't love that ho. Oh, but he love you, though.|You need to check him. What's he say about moving in? Jody wants to live with his mama,|not with me. Jody, my Jody. He's a mama's boy.|He'll never leave his mama. Then let him fuck his mama.|Have her ass up at the clinic. Shit! I love you, Jody. I love you too. I want you to have my baby. I want to have your baby. I want to have your baby. I love you, Jody. I love you. I love you too. I love you, Jody, but you scare me. You scare me. No, that's my baby. Oh, my baby. Don't cry, Mama. Give him back!|God, please, give him back! Jody! Can I have my car|so I can get to work? Your car? My car! Go on with all that, girl.|I'm here asleep. It's Monday. I can't be late. Monday?

Listen to Daddy.|I love you. Love you too, Mommy. Thumbs up. My man. You be good too. -I'm always good, baby.|-Yeah, right. Come in front, little man. Young baller, future shot caller. 5:05, Jody. Don't be late. You want to nod your head too?|That's my boy. Wait a minute, Jody!|Hold it! Shit! You got a man out here waiting. How do I look? Okay. Where you going? I don't know. I'm just going.|He asked and I'm going. Necklace or no necklace?|You don't know. Why don't you know|where he's taking you? How'd you know to wear|that tight-ass dress? This is an all-purpose dress. I am|prepared for anything in this dress. He likes music, so we're probably|gonna hear music. You know where he live?|Been to his house yet? What you know besides him|smiling at you? He could be crazy. Is he a killer like Henry? Why don't you get an L-7 boyfriend? A white-collar brother|with a briefcase. You like them thugs.|I don't know why. Your daddy was a thug. I need a man|who can handle a woman like me. He's got to be a thug to handle you? Melvin's not a thug. He's a nice guy. I'm going out, that's all I know.|That's all I need to know. I got a date. I look "okay"?|I look good. What's up, man? Them's some nice shoes. Stacey Adams. Stacey Adams, huh? OG style. So where y'all going? I'm taking her to a club on Crenshaw,|listen to some music.

That was a long time ago. I was young... ...and dumb. Jody, are you messin' with my date? No, I'm keeping him company.|Playing the host. Nobody likes sitting up here,|waiting alone. Why can't women be ready on time?|They always make us wait. Whatever, Jody. All right, y'all have a good time. Mama, remember your curfew. You need money?|I got some change for you. Jody, you ain't got no money. Bring me back a Fatburger,|on the real, little cheese. Go in the house! You be careful with my mama, man. Got that pure cake.|No butter, no sugar. Straight, like my brother's soul.|We got pound cake. -Give me some pound cake.|-Here you go, brother. Thank you, brother.|Have a good day. Today I begin a new life. I am the master of my abilities... ...and today will be a great|and beautiful day. What? I said, today I begin a new life.

Look at my man there selling T-shirts. A brother selling pies and papers.|Cake Man over there. Everybody moving, making money, right? While we standing still, being broke. I figured all this shit out, man.|All this. The world moves forward|through transactions. Commerce, nigga. The exchange of goods and services. All the real ballin',|successful folks are sellers. All the broke people playing|catch-up are buyers. I ain't trying to go out like that.|I'm gonna be a seller. I'm gonna get my own business. Change the game. You want to sell clothes? Like the man who came to the phone|company selling dresses. Remember? Cute ass. -Women's or men's clothes?|-Women's. Women buy clothes every other day. But you need to know about women. I know all about females. You hear your son? -You're a bad boy.|-Believe me. Are you trying to be a salesman|or a shyster? You buy from a shyster,|you feel like you got took. You buy from a good salesman|and you feel lucky. A good salesman makes you|feel so good... ...you'll go back again to give|more and more money. That sounds like sex. -What else should I know?|-Sizes. You gotta know a woman's size|on sight. Don't wait for her to tell you.|Just know. -Compliment them, even if they ugly.|-Especially if they are. -Like Bernice.|-She's big. They'll be your regulars. You need to know her favorite|color, what's in season.... And fabrics.|How it feels on our skin. What's an average size? I'm a size 5-6. That's average. For who? A white girl? Jody, I'm a size 1 6|and that's average too. -Remember that, you'll make money.|-It's best on payday. Rachel? My name is Joseph Summers.|My friends call me Jody. You want to be my friend? I wonder if I could|talk to your customers... ...show them my merchandise. I didn't want to come in and talk|to people without your blessing. What you selling? You see this? That's your color.

You can wear it to work,|go straight to happy hour. Them pants got happy hour|written all over them. Baby, I ain't gonna lie to you. Them is one of a kind. Explosive! You see anyone with them pants on,|you can come bite me. It ain't happening. How much? I'll let it go for $40. Forty dollars?! Look, $35. That's the lowest I can go.|You're killing me. Okay, 35. Thank you.|I'll squeeze my tiny ass in this... ...and upstage these bitches in here.|You like it? Cute. One... ...two hundred, three.... That's four hundred dollars! That is crazy!

That beautiful dress, my son looking|nice.... We're doing big things! What'd you do to my car? I got them tinted windows done. I got some 1 0s from my Mexican homies. I told you she'd like that.|Daddy got taste. Want some breakfast? --I learned so many|incredible secrets. When placing ads in newspapers... ...just one secret I can show you|can make you a fortune. Nice, huh? State of the art. Yeah. This is the bomb. -Mama didn't say she got a new TV.|-She didn't know. It's a surprise. Oh, yeah? I have to hook up the VCR|and set the timer... ...so she can see-- I hooked it up and set it already.|Pass the remote, youngster. Let me show you how it works. I got this bad boy|from my man for free. You know how much it costs|in one of them electronic stores? -It cost a grip.|-You got that right. But we black folks|live by the barter system. You know about that? When black folks had no money,|we traded for things. My man give me this TV 'cause I did|some work for him back in the day. You know, shot a couple niggas,|cut up some folk. Dumb shit. I was like you, Jody.|Young, dumb and out of control. I did a dime. Ten years straight|in San Quentin and Folsom. All over some dumb shit. But you? You're smarter than I was at your age. I gotta hand it to you.|You're smart. You're no killer like me. That's good. I was bad.|I ain't had my dome straight. But, Jody, peep this. On the real. Me and your mama|are getting real serious... ...so I'm gonna be|around here for a while. I ain't trying to be your daddy|or nothing, but if you need advice... ...feel free to talk to me. 'Cause I seen it all... ...and I done it all to the full. You may think you see new shit|out here, but it's just... ...a rerun to me. You know what I'm saying? Mama? Mama, have you got this nigga|living up in here now? -Can't I have a life?|-You got a life! Them days are over. I ain't|like Big Mama. I got to have fun. You have fun. Why can't I? But why does the man|have to live here? He a killer,|and you got him in the kitchen... ...scrambling eggs|and drinking the Kool-Aid? He was making me breakfast! All right. What am I supposed to do?|Roll over and die? You gonna kick me out? You gonna kick me out? Let me know now.|I don't need no surprises. I do. Surprise me and move out. You could learn from Melvin. He's done well for himself.|He's turned his life around. He has his own business. I don't have|to force him to get a job! You're not a baby no more, Jody.|You need to grow up. You got your own family. Why don't you|and Yvette get a place together? Why are you so afraid to grow up|and be a man? Leave the nest. I am a man. So you're kicking me out? What for? To be with this nigga?|You don't even know him. What do you mean, "leave the nest"?|You didn't! This is Grandma's house! I don't have to leave|if you never did! What are you talking about? Mama needs a life too. Fuck you, bro. Can you tell your son something? No, I'm not in it. But why he do the things he do,|Miss Juanita? You must know. I don 't know what to do.|I love him, but how much can I take? I can't believe this! I told you, I won't be|in y'all's business. What's between you and Jody|is you and Jody. What do I do with his selfish ass? He got me and his son walking|while he rolling in my car. The car I'm paying the note on.|Man, I feel so stupid. You ain't stupid, Yvette. You're just in love with a man. When you in love with a man,|he can make you feel high. So high you just be in outer space. But he can also make you feel low. Real low. And he can keep you there. Keep you down. If you let him. But don't even worry about feeling|used. It's just temporary. We all get used.|Men use women, women use men. Just accept that you'll be used. But if you feel so used|that you got nothing left... ...if the man ain't giving you|the energy you need to love him... ...even when he's acting|like a bastard, you need to let go. If you ain't got nothing to give|yourself or your baby... ...you won't have it to give to him. Good boy. Now the corn. Did you finish the tomatoes?|There you go. Thattaboy. A little more water|on the greens. Hi, Juanita. Where's my baby? Hey, Mama. Bring my grandbaby here|so I can kiss her goodbye. Bye, sweetness. Be a good girl. Ooh, Melvin! Oh, baby. -You gonna give me a cavity.|-Oh, yes, baby. Melvin! Okay, circles. Around and around. Take it, take it. You ride. I love to ride! It's the African squat fuck.|The old nigger squat fuck. Squat, baby. Squat, baby. Can y'all keep it down?|People are trying to sleep! Let me down, baby. Fuck! --and that she was impressed.|Broke her off. Made her feel good. Now I got myself a regular customer. What the hell is he looking at? Trying to psych me out, talking about|being a killer. Old-school nigga. He don't want us to have|to put heat on his ass, do he? Want me to take him out? Let the nigga breathe. He make my mama unhappy, we make|his ass bleed. On the real. Make him feel the steel.|Long as she happy, he got his life. Won't be no strife. And I hope his ass hear me too. I hear you. You know your problem? You think you know everything,|but you don't know shit. I see you got a little business|going. Well, that's good. You make that paper. But when you making paper,|there's rules that go with it. You gotta learn the difference|between guns and butter. There are two types of niggas. Those|with guns, and those with butter. What are the guns?|That's the real estate. The stocks and bonds. Art work. Shit that appreciates in value. What's the butter? Cars, clothes, all the other bullshit|that don't mean shit later. That's what it's all about.|Guns and butter. You little dumb motherfuckers. See what I'm sayin', cuz? This nigga doing this shit|every night. What? Why can't you just|sit still and relax? Don't complain.|You left me here all weekend! Don't complain.|You left me here all weekend! Why can't you sit still? That's what divides us|as a people. No focus. Why don't you sit down and focus?|Watch some PBS or something. You so full of shit.|So fucking selfish. What's this old pizza? Since you're starting shit,|where you been since yesterday? Slinging dresses, making money. Got the brakes fixed.|What you been doing? -You been fucking around?|-Nope. Let me smell your dick. Go on with that. If you ain't been whoring around,|let me smell your dick. I can tell. Go on. I ain't playing with you. Move!|I'll knock your ass out. See? My shit smells good, don't it? See what? You probably washed it off. I'm tired of you messing around on me. I know you and Sweetpea was out|doing me wrong. I didn't do nothing. You gonna sit there with|a straight face and say that? I didn't do nothing.|I was over at Kim's, playing spades. You're a liar!|You went to that after-hours spot. Some nasty heifer was|shaking her ass in your face... ...then you went to a private room|with the bitch... ...and did I don't know what! I know 'cause Chris was there.|Sharika's Chris? He saw you. You busted.|It's all on your grill, stupid. All right. I was there. But I didn't fuck. She just danced for me, that's all. -Did you touch her?|-Hell, no. That nasty girl? We can't touch them anyway.|It's against the rules. Private dance, that's all.|Just a quick lap dance. You don't believe me?|It's the truth. I didn't fuck! It was a private dance, in the corner.|I didn't do shit. You must take me|for some kind of fool. You foul. I smell|your dirty ass from here. Why you got to be around|them nasty girls? They do that shit every night, dummy. You know how many dicks|they suck every night? And you go down there like|the rest of them fools! You better not bring me nothing|from them bitches. Fuck it then! Don't believe me. I said I didn't fuck that girl.|Stop putting your hands on me. Where you going?! I hate you!|You're selfish, arrogant and stupid! -Whatever.|-I don't need you! I'm tired of sitting here,|not having a man with me. Being lonely. I'm gonna do|what the fuck I wanna do. What are you gonna do? I said I'm tired of waiting|for your ass. I hate you. I'm gonna have me a man. A man who wants to be with me|and my baby... ...and have a family.|A real man, Jody. Not some little boy, still living|at home with his mama. Fuck you! Kiss my ass! Go out on the streets and be a trick.|I should knock you the fuck out. You better not, or I'll call your|probation officer... ...and they'll put you|back in jail! Now.... Kiss my ass, nigga! You better walk away. I hate you!|You so stupid! You hate me? Keep on saying that shit. That's right. I hate your ass. You make me sick.|I can't stand your black ass! You act like a little boy|instead of a grown man. I hate you! You know what? I hate your ass too.|Do something. Give me my keys. You ain't going-- Get off me! There you go,|coming downstairs... ...showing off before the neighbors. -Fuck them! I hate you!|-I hate you too! I love you! I love you so much! I love you too. I ain't going nowhere. -You feel him?|-Yes, I feel him. You feel him? Oh, my God, I feel him! He big! -What do you feel?|-Daddy Dick. -You love Daddy Dick?|-I love him. -You say it.|-I love Daddy Dick. You gonna clean all that mess up? -I'll clean up!|-You gonna cook some tacos? My God! I'm about to come.|I'm gonna come! Yes, I'll make the tacos! Oh, my God.... I could bite you right now. Damn, boy. Shit! Now what? That's the beat-it-up-white dance. You are so stupid. I was over there to the right.|Did you feel me? -I see you ain't going nowhere.|-That's 'cause I'm sprung. So you're gonna clean up that mess|and make tacos, right? I'm gonna cook and clean.|You put it down. I'll feed you, you big old monster.|I love you, boy. I love you too. -Bring that chocolate here.|-I'm on my way. Come here. Just make sure|you can handle me. You trying to go for round two? Jody, when I say I hate you, what|I really mean is that I love you. But you scare me. It's like|we ain't gonna be together. I'm trying to sleep. We'll always be together.|Unless I get killed or something. Don't talk like that.|Don't even play around like that. I'd go crazy if something happened. On the real, you know why|I made you have Joe-Joe? I thought I was gonna get shot|out in these streets. I wanted a piece of me to still|be here, even if I was gone. When he was born, I was like, "Cool.|No matter what happens to me... ...I'll still be here in some way." So if something happened to you,|what about me? You'd be all right. Go to sleep. You don't want me here? Kick me out! Shut up, Pea! Nobody said that! Y'all in there-- What?|Sinuating? lnsinuating? Fuck it. I'll leave. -You need to shut up.|-No, you do. You're the one talking|loud and making noise. Are you back-talking me? Huh? You don't know how|to act towards your man? I'll put my foot so far up your--|Come on in, Jody. A houseful of women!|Houseful of sensitive females... ...dealing with they damn hormones!|Y'all unstable creatures! I won't say the "B" word. "Unstable|creatures." That's my new word. Mama, don't say nothing. You'll make it worse.|He's leaving anyway. I'm trying to concentrate.|They won't let me be. Want a drink? -No, I'm cool.|-Why are you acting all shy? My house is your house|Mi casa es su casa! I got milk, water, Kool-Aid... ...strawberry soda. I'll get you|a strawberry soda. I'm sorry, Mrs. Daniels. I'm so sorry. I love you. And Kim. In fact, I love you more,|'cause without you... ...Kim wouldn't be here. Y'all said you love me!|You told me I could stay here! Bought me new clothes|and the video game! I thought we had a family!|I got no family! I'm trying to make that happen|with y'all. -What, nigga?|-Come here. I'm talking to my family here. I love y'all. Both of you. Come on. I need you to roll with me. All right, then. I'm leaving. Let's go get some liquor.|Strippers ain't at work yet. You don't need liquor.|You're already too fired up. Who the fuck are you calling fired up? You're responsible for the shit|they give me. You still ain't found me no job!|Hook me up with your business! When you gonna find me a job? -Why I gotta find you a job?|-'Cause you my man! Okay. Step to my office. All right. You have a mission. I'm gonna give|you one piece of merchandise. If you can sell it,|we can talk business. -Sell one thing.|-One thing. Check it out. I got dresses, shoes, baby clothes.|Take your pick. I'll sell this dress. -Not that.|-I know what I want to sell! Yes, the original cake.|The original man. Salaam. Break bread, brother. Hey, take a look at this dress.|Want to buy it? -Not my color.|-No, no, hold on. Stand still. Look at that. That looks good. I don't want it.|It don't even look in season. It is. They're wearing this in Paris. I saw Tyra Banks in this|and you finer than her. What's the material? Goddamn! You want to buy|the dress or not? You treat me like I'm some|fucker asking for change. I'm doing something constructive. I could be out knocking folks over,|but I'm trying to live right. You call that living right?|Selling a stolen dress? I ain't stole nothing in my life!|I got this from my homeboy. That's what y'all do? Boost? Sell stolen stuff? Like that man|there trying to sell that camera? -You don't want me answering it?|-Go ahead. It's probably for me. Collect call from|California Correctional Facility. Correctional Facility?|Do you accept the charges? Hell, no! Who's calling you from jail?|That nigga Rodney? Oh, you don't hear me now? Hello! Rodney's lonely. He just want|someone to talk to. Don't trip. That why the phone bill|was an extra $1 00? I'm paying you to talk to him?|You putting my money on his books too? Didn't I tell you|to put a block on the phone? You don't listen to nobody. Don't even trip. Collect call from|California Correctional Facility. I accept. -Hello, Yvette?|-This ain't no motherfucking Yvette. Put her on the phone! This is my house!|Don't ask to speak to my woman! Your house, nigga?|You don 't even live there. Is this Jody? The Jody|that got my boo pregnant? Who won't take his|responsibilities as a man? Living at your mama's house?|Running around... ...like a little boy? You's a bitch! Look at you! What you got?|Your ass in jail! Don't tell me how to handle mine. Don't call my fucking house no more! My girl ain't feeling you, cuz! Nigga, concentrate on|not dropping the soap... ...bitch-ass nigga! Fuck you, cuz. I want a block on the fucking phone! All right, Jody! Damn! What are you doing, sitting on the|phone, telling him my business? He's saying : "You still live with your mama!"|I don't want to hear that! She's so suspicious.|She always think I'm fucking someone. I go to the bathroom,|"You got a bitch in there?" I'm going to the store,|"There a bitch at the store?" Then I got to come home to Melvin|and his bullshit. I want to get saved. Say what, bruh? Get the fuck out of here!|We're talking. Poncho! I'll be done with your bike|in an hour. Come back. I want to be saved, Jody. I need to be baptized,|so I can go to heaven. Wash my sins away,|so them gates open up. I don't want Jesus to say,|"Turn your ass around." You should do it too.|Get baptized with me. What did you do, man? You did|something bad to be saying this. No, I'm trying to keep|from doing something. I need money. A job to keep me busy. Something besides|playing Madden all day. I don't even stay at Kim's house|during the day. I leave at 9 :00. Come back at 6, acting like|I did something constructive. Like I'm working. I ain't did that shit|since continuation school. Sneaking around Kim and her mama|like I'm a child. Like I'm a scared little boy. I gotta|ask my woman and her mama for money. How do you think that makes me feel?|Like a man? This shit is tearing me up, cuz.|It's eating me alive. I don't want to end up killing nobody. What am I gonna do, Jody? Shit, I was in the same boat too. You gotta find something you like|to do. Something you're interested in. Like I did. What you good at? Robbing. -Hey, Jody.|-What's going on? -What's up, Jody?|-What's going on with you? -I need some new boots.|-I got you covered with gator, girl! They might be bootleg,|but I got you, girl! Dresses! I got some business suits|coming in! You'll love those! Why are you yakking and talking shit? I'm trying to make money. When|money come in, you never complain. Don't be cute. Nice and quiet. My own little spot. Watch my tomatoes. Got some wine. Over there. I think I see|some weeds by the peppers. Why don't you use Weed-B-Gon? I'm a natural gardener.|That's how it was done way back. You get on your knees|and pull them up. It's what my mom and daddy did.|It's what I do. Remember to put the weeds|in the compost pile. You doing nothing|but bossing me around. I think I'll plant|some summer squash next year. -Jody, we got to stop this.|-What? Every time I come out,|you go in the house. Nobody's thinking about you, bruh. This is where I relax.|Take that noise somewhere else. Every time I come out to work|in the garden, he goes in the house. Give me some wine. Seven, winner. Baby, be sweet. Eleven, winner. Seven, eleven.|That's all I'm rolling. How come you ain't|brought your kids around? Don't you got a son, 1 7,|named Duquan? And a little girl about 5 named Maya? -You tell my mama about them?|-She know. Why ain't you brought them around? You ashamed of them? They ugly like you? I don't get along too well|with my babies' mamas. -I'm sure you understand.|-No, I don't. I'm cool with both my babies' mamas. -We'll see how long that lasts.|-Long as I want it to. But we're talking about you, not me. I talked to your son the other day. I heard you say his name|when y'all old niggas was here... ...playing cards. He live five minutes from here,|in Inglewood. I drove to Morningside High School|and asked him about you. He didn't have shit to say about you|'cause you whipped his mama's ass. What do you think about that? You gonna beat my mama? No. I think you know better|than that, don't you? You want to walk around here with your|chest out, saying you a real man. Know why I don't like you|around my mama? 'Cause you foul. You're a dirty motherfucker, Melvin. Don't think I'll let you|get it in her head... ...to kick me out like|the last nigga did my brother. 'Cause I ain't having it, bruh. No way, no how. Ah, youngster. You get your ass out of here. Mama! Yeah, that's right.|Call for your mama. I stayed off you|out of respect for her. If not for your mama, I'd have broke|your little ass down long ago. "Jody? Little Jody?" Know what I see when I look in your|eyes? A scared little bitch. That's what I see. If we was on lock-down,|I'd make you get on your knees. Twenty years. Let's see|where you be 20 years from now. Melvin? What y'all doing? Nothing. Can you go get me some cigarettes? -Maybe some beer. What you doing?|-You're so sweet. Watch your hands. Hurry back, okay? Want anything from the store? What's up, Jody? The candles smell good. Aromatherapy. You smoke? No. I don't mess with that. So you and Yvette got a baby?|Where y'all stay at? We don't live together. You ain't gotta lie.|I know y'all live together. You drop her off|and pick her up every day. That's just what we do.|I don't want to discuss 'Vette. We don't need to talk.|I just want some dick. Why you want to fuck me?|To make my girl mad? -That what you want to do?|-No! It ain't like that. I just think you're cute.|I mean, I see you all the time. When we was in the parking lot... ...l thought we was feeling|each other. Was I wrong? Yeah, I was feeling you. But I ain't feeling this. I'm out. Jody, come on. Don't be like that. This is just between us. I see how you look|when you come around. You saying you don't want to hit this? Come over here and get this pussy. I don't need to go there with you. Yvette. Besides, I ain't got no condoms. No way. Somebody don't want to leave. Oh, fuck! What are you doing, girl? I can't do this. Oh, shit. I know you want this. I can't do this. I promise it'll be good. No, this shit is foul.|It's foul. This shit's wrong! Get off me. I can't fuck you.|My girl finds out... ...she'll kill me.|I love her too much. So you a little bitch?|Your girl tells you what to do? I told you it was a trick. Hood rat. I don't need you! I can get|dick any time I want! You want this! No, you want this.|You lucky I let you taste it. This Daddy Dick belongs to Yvette.

Don't flip this.|What's it doing in my car? -Hello!|-Can I get the food? I can't believe I fell for that shit|you said the other night. How you're gonna do right|by me and Joe-Joe. How you won't cheat... ...not gonna hurt me,|keep breaking my heart. What was all that? -Writing on the money.|-Give me that! This is bullshit. Get the food! Thank you so much. "Thank you so much." You being funny? "Trojan. Very Sensitive. Lubricated. America's No. 1 Condom."|At least you went all out. All I get is a trip to the clinic.|Give me my shake! So who was you fucking? Don't lie. You been fucking|somebody in my car, Jody? No. I don't know. You don't know? You mean you don't remember|who you were with? You been with that many girls?

Who did you fuck with these condoms? I'm not stupid. This is a|three-pack and there's one left. Tell me the truth! We're grown. We ain't kids. Be real. Be a man for once in your life. You still fucking Peanut? I know you're still fucking Peanut. I figured that much. I ain't even mad at you,|'cause I already knew that. Did you fuck her|with these condoms in my car? No, you didn't fuck her|in my car. Did you? No. Are we picking up Joe-Joe? He's fine. Take me home.|We gonna finish this. Jody, I know you love me. I also know you fuck other girls.|I don't like it, but I know you. So just be real with me. Will you be honest? If you can take it.|You're starting to get on my nerves. I'm getting on your nerves?|You're the one fucking around. You get with any of them|clients of yours? A few. Feel better now? I love you, girl.

Hold on. You got it all twisted up! I lie 'cause I love you. Being|honest means I don't give a fuck. Out on the street, I tell the hos the|truth. I lie to you because I care. It's obvious|you can't handle the truth. You fuck Pandora? Why-- Come on, Yvette. Open the door. If this food gets cold,|I'm gonna be mad. Since you're being honest,|just be real. Did you? If you want me to, yes, I did. What do you mean, if I want you to?|No, I don't want you to! Did you? Oh, my God. You did. -Why, Jody?|-I didn't. I was playing with you. -Not with that bitch!|-I fucked others. Not her. -With someone at my job?|-No. I wouldn't do that to you. That's breaking the code.|I wouldn't do that. -Staring at me and shit--|-Why you so fired up? You gave those bitches at my job|a reason to laugh at me! Calm down before I come slap you. You ain't doing shit! Why you insecure?|Nobody's laughing at you. They're probably jealous|you got a man who loves you. Don't be so insecure.|I can't stand it. If I'm insecure, it's because|you made me this way! All you think about is yourself! Out of all people, why'd you have|to fuck that girl? Damn! -I told you I didn't!|-You're a liar! -I'm out of here.|-You ain't leaving. -Get out of the way.|-Stay here! I'm sick of your shit! Don't put your hands on me!|Are you fucking crazy? Shut up!

You lied.... I hate you, Jody. Why are you doing this? Baby, why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? I promised. It was my fault. I'll make it up to you. I'll make you feel good. Jody! I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm Popeye the sailor man! -Who are you?|-Who am I? -Who am I?|-That's what I said. Popeye, you ain't gonna do nothing. Son of a bitch! Someone stole my damn car! Son of a bitch. Mama! Yvette. Hi, baby. Baby, don't be mad at me.|It ain't my fault. I love you. I'm listening. Some Mexican stole your car. What? Jody-- You hear?

I stole my car, Jody. Jody, where you rolling? Y'all watch my bike, homies. Open the door, Yvette! Go away! I'm sorry I hit you, okay?|You blacked my eye too. What about me? Why are you mad? -When will you grow up?|-What? I am grown! No, for real, Jody. When will you realize|you had something really good? I take a lot of shit from you|because I love you. Baby, I understand. I understand, okay?|Please open the door. Let's discuss this inside. I won't be selfish no more.|I won't fuck other girls. I'll be good, I promise. You hear me? You don't mean it. You're just running|your mouth, like you always do. You don't mean that shit! Open this motherfucking door! -Why'd you steal my car?|-Your car?! Yeah! If not, give me back|the Daytons I put on. The tinted windows I paid for. The money I put into the engine|and the brakes! -Open this door!|-Jody, don't do this! Daddy! No, Joe-Joe. Come here. -I want to see my daddy!|-I want to see my son!

I mean, I cheat.|I do what I do, but I'm good. I'm good to her ass. I take her back and forth to work,|I fix the car when it breaks... ...l give her money|for the phone bill and groceries. I even rub her feet sometime!|She say I'm selfish. Ever see it from her point of view?|What if you was Yvette and she was you? What if she fucked around on you... ...took your car and left you|at home all day with a baby? -You're taking her side.|-Hold it. All I'm saying is|you may be a little selfish. Jody. Look at me. You have got|to think of her as a woman. What if someone did all the shit|you do to Yvette to me? Your daddy used to do|the same shit you're doing now. I just know how Yvette feels. Yvette loves you. She just feels hurt. A woman gets tired of a man|after a while... ...if she feels used|and unappreciated. Believe me, as much as you're|thinking about Yvette... ...she's thinking about you too. Stop telling girls you want|a baby while you're doing it. They believe your lying ass. I fell for the same shit|when I was their age. Yvette. You know you love this shit. No, you love this shit. You bet I do.|I love that big ass, girl. Yeah. For sure. Please believe that. Hey, girl. What you doing? Are you on the damn phone again?|Get off the phone. What's that noise? You okay? That's Chris. Nigga is trippin'.|We've been drinking thug passion. Get off the phone! Bumping your gums,|talking to hos. You made up with that nigga Jody yet? I ain't thinking about him.

Shut the fuck up!|You see I'm on the damn phone! -Shut your motherfucking ass!|-Fuck them hos! Always talking to them bitches about|they niggas. Attend to your nigga. Jody crossed my last nerve.|I can't put up with it no more. -You know what I'm saying?|-I know. Who the fuck are you talking to? Who is that? I thought about|getting back together... ...but I gots to teach him a lesson,|know what I mean? Girl, I ain't gonna lie.|I miss his ass like shit. I love him to death... ...but I can't have nobody act like|they own me, even my baby's daddy. You feel me, girl? I feel you. I feel you. I gotta go. Jody.

You tried to take my liquor! And you tried to take my bike. What kind of bitch-ass punch was that?|I thought I taught you better. I hit the nigga in the teeth. Are you saying his teeth|are harder than your fist? Let me show you. You gotta learn|the one-hitter quitter. No, Pea. Not him. Hit Mr. Aliz there.|He took my liquor. Do him first.

I'm fresh out.|Ain't you happy to see me? No. I didn't tell you to come here.|You invited yourself. When my parole officer saw your|letters, he approved my stay here. I wrote you twice, just to be nice.|I wasn't thinking about you. You wasn't? Why'd you accept|all them calls then? I must've been in your head. I'm your first. Your first, your last|and you're my only. -Quit playing and give me some love.|-Get the fuck out of my room. I ain't going there.|And don't wake my baby.

Please believe me. -Them niggas still at your house?|-No. Wait right here. I didn't ask Rodney to come.|He just showed up. Now he won't leave. You wanted a man at the house.|I guess you happy now. I didn't ask him to come, Jody. I'm not fucking him,|if you're thinking that. The car broke|and the engine needs fixing. Ain't my problem. -Get the fuck off my doorstep.|-Wait! He don't love me no more. He don't love me no more. Oh, my God.|He don't love me no more. Get me out of here! -Peanut, what you doing?|-Nothing. You miss me? You love me? You hear me? You love me?

I show|you something new, and you do this? Plant this shit in my garden? -Are you saying I planted this?|-Who else? I didn't. You need to check|your boyfriend, Melvin. You're blaming me for his bullshit. You know you did it!|Melvin wouldn't do no shit like this. You trust him before me? Why would I|put weed in my mama's garden? -Shut up!|-What kind of fool do you think I am? Where's Melvin? Ask him! -He's a bitch-ass nigga.|-Shut up, Jody. Watch. I'll show you. Tell him. Tell him, Mama. Tell me what? She found the weed you planted. Tell her about it so she can|get off my case. You did it, huh? Melvin.... -Yeah.|-Kick him out, Mama. -Mel! What were you thinking about?|-Getting blazed. I'm not understanding. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Ain't that a bitch. Oh, so it's cool now? When it was|on me, it was World War Ill. But since Mr. Melvin 'fessed up|to it, it's all good? See how you is, Mama?|I would never do that shit. I don't want to go back to jail,|or put you there. But I don't get no credit for that. -Shut up.|-Can't stand the truth? Shut up! How you think I feel, you laid up|with this thug-ass nigga... ...you don't even know,|who wants to kick me out. I can take care of myself! You don't need to check|the folks I deal with. Am I in your business with all the|hookers you run with? No. So I need the same respect! You are getting on my last nerve|with this shit about Melvin! This is my house too! Your house? Your house? Do you pay any bills in this|motherfucker? Do you fix anything? When's the last time you paid a bill?|All you do is eat, sleep and shit! Walking around here|like you're King Tut! Don't give me mess about|whose house this is. It's mine! If I want to bring a man in... ...I'll bring a man in!|That's my say, not yours! -What the fuck you laughing at?|-Your spoiled ass. Melvin, honey.|Don't start anything, please. No, 'Nita. He need to hear this. I keep quiet out of love|and respect for your mama... -...but you need to be a man.|-Be a man? What do you mean? Like you?|I should be like you, Melvin? You could never be like me.|You don't need to be. What you need to do|is to stop blaming everyone... ...for your problems. Check yourself. You know what your problem is,|baby boy? You got shit twisted. You got an Oedipus complex.|Your mama ain't your woman. But this is my woman. My woman. All right, that's enough. Come on. Forget this shit.|I got heat for niggas like you. -Jody, that's enough.|-Nigga, you need to move! What, motherfucker?|I said not to fuck with me! Stop it! Melvin, stop! Melvin! No, Melvin, stop it!|Stop it! Break it up! Are you crazy?! I told him not to fuck with me!|But you want to fuck with me? I try to be a good nigga, but I can't|because bitch-ass niggas... ...like you want to fuck with me! You want a nigga with two strikes|to go to jail for life! I'm leaving. No!

Rodney, wake up! Goddamn! Rodney, you have to find somewhere|to live. You can't stay here no more. You know I ain't got|nowhere else to stay. I don't care where you go, just go! Get your monkey ass out!|My house smell like stale feet! Get out! Good morning, scrub. Built you a little fort, huh? -I don't give a fuck about your fort.|-I hate you. I hate you too, li'l nigga.|You ain't my son. Shit. -Come here, Yvette.|-Get off me. -We need some order around here.|-Get your hands off me!

Get off my mommy! Get off me. -I want my daddy.|-I know. -Fuck your punk-ass daddy!|-I do too. Fish and bread keep a poor man fed. Add 'em up, bro. I'll get you something to fight with. It didn't take you that long|to sit down. He see you. He's just trying to front. Thanks, Kim. What's up, Pea? Strike 'em up. Where you at, Pea? Come on, add them up. Where you going, Yvette? Why you acting all man?|It's like you don't miss me. You don't know what I've been|through the last two days. Rodney tried to rape me|in front of Joe-Joe. He was screaming, "Daddy!"|and I was there alone. Baby, I'm here. I miss you. I miss your ass so much. I love you. You're my rib.|You heard of Adam's rib? That's how God made Eve. I'm gonna get my stuff. Damn. I can't do this. How you gonna get him out? I don't know. But if we whip his ass,|he'll come back with his homies... ...and shoot me, my girl and my baby. I ain't trying to be no killer.|I can't have that on my heart, Pea. I feel you. If you don't want to, I'm with you. But if you do want to take|this fool out, I'm here too. Let's pray on it. Dear Lord, please forgive us for|the sins we have brought upon us... ...and show us forgiveness|for all our sins in the future. I know you understand that niggas|ain't perfect, but we try, Lord. We try to keep our heads up|in bad times. This is a bad time. Show us the way. And if you can't show us the way,|then forgive us for being lost. Jody. Motherfucking Jody.

Melvin told me y'all had a talk. Yeah, we did. I'm glad you got a boyfriend. I'm glad you're happy. I just thought once you got a new|boyfriend, you'd kick me out. I'd be out in the street|and get killed like Ray-Ray. You did kick me out... ...but I ain't dead yet.|I'm a rider for mine. Nobody kicked you out, Jody.|You just left the nest. And quit this talk about dying.|Nobody's gonna die no time soon. You don't know what life'll deal you. Just try to be happy|while you're here... ...hope there's another place|better than this... ...and hope that Jesus|lets your ass in. But while you're here... ...you better watch your back. That's what I know, Mama. That's what I know. Let me get some of this wine. That's mine. Go get your own. Why? You realize I'm a grown-ass|man right about now, right? -It's cool.|-So stupid. I'll get my own. I love you. I love you. You be good. Ain't no thing, Mama.|I'm gonna do my thug thizzle. I'm gonna make some changes,|change my life. -What's cracking?|-What's up, Jody? Not much. Loving this California life.|You know. Keep my mama happy, bro. I'm on the job. Stay up, baby boy. I got you. What you know about that? That's my shit, youngster. "You know nothing about it.|It's for grown folks." I used to get a lot of pussy|off that song. Pick up a bigger jumpsuit. Why you always leave me walking? Walking will help you drop it off. Real funny. I can't wait|to drop it off. I love y'all. I'm about to spank that ass. No, I'm about to spank|that ass for life. Please believe me. On the real! -Is that what you think?|-That's what I know. I bid four books. -Gotta get four. Stop talking shit.|-What? That's cool. Take your little shit.|Bring it back. Girl, you don't know|nothing about this. I got things going on|you wouldn't understand. -All that talking.|-That's all to Jesus. Nigga, put the card down!|Put the card down! I'm gonna take it. -I love you.|-I love you, but I'm gonna take that. Can I get some love? Don't say you love me|and don't give me no love. I get a little pickle tongue? Okay, back to the ass whuppin'.|Here we go. Talk to me, baby.|Should I bid for nine? Bam, nigga! What nine?|You better get your three bucks. Be gentle with my baby, okay? -I know. I should.|-You'll create a gangsta. It's a girl. This one is mine.|I need a girl.
