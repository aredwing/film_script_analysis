I didn't plan this!|All three are so different... so beautiful,|so... so special. You'd better choose one, or|you're gonna wearyourself out. How can you choose between the colors|of nature's beautiful flowers? How? Besides, they'd be heartbroken,|and I'd be dead. Well, you may die from exhaustion. So, um,|what are their names?

What's going on?|What's happening? What are you doing|in my lingerie? Your lingerie?|Open your fake eyes, honey! He obviously gave this little|number to all of us. But only one of us is doing it justice!|- But he's mine! He's mine! Then, why is he in Miami|on monday giving me this? Well, tuesday|he was in Chicago. Wednesday, New York. Este walter told me that a venus|hootchie was moving in on my man! What doyou mean your man? Not that I would|ever watch... what's his name? Walter? I assure you that hootchie venus|he was referring to is not me. It's you! And you! This is ludicrous.|Tomas would not cheat on me... with some bookworm|and a maid. I'm the maid, and I'm gonna wipe|the floor with you! This whole thing's so absurd!|- Especially, since Tomas and I are engaged. Tomas Fuentes bought you that ring?|- Yeah. Nice! Cubic zirconium. For 10 bucks I can get you a matching pair of earrings.|- Wait a minute, that's a... that's a pinky ring! You better get back to the castle, princess,|before you turn into a pumpkin! Well, at least it's real,|which is more than I can say for some... other things in this room.|- That's it! I'll shove your tiara right upyour... Hold it! Hold it!|- Psycho. This is just perfect! Tomas Fuentes cheats|on us, and we fight with each other? This man,|as we have witnessed,,, he is deceiving,|he is conniving... and he is untrustworthy! Have we no pride, girls? He doesn't deserve us! I'm with the bookworm.|My mom always said... "lfa man cheats on you,|he doesn't respect you." I propose that we walk out ofhere,|and we never look back. We should wait here|and give him a heart attack. No, no, no, no. We must cease|and desist of all contact whatsoever. That's what he deserves.|- Cracked huevos is what he deserves. But I like your plan...|it's subtle. And subtle's|your middle name. As of this moment, we agree|to be honest in our intention... to abandon Tomas Fuentes. We swear on our oath|as honorable women. Who taught you to talk like that?|- Agreed? Agreed.|- Good. I'm Lorena Morales.|- I'm Cici. Just "Cici"? Like Charo.|- Like Cher. Que ridiculez,|- I am patricia sofia... whatever!|- Ordonez coronado del pescador. Ay, she must be european! Remember, we've|got to be strong. Because we deserve|more than this. I don't care|how many times he tries. I will not take his call,|- Neither will I. I wonderwho he will call first.|I mean... I know it won't be me. If he can have you two,|what would he want with a chica like me? Pues, ciao, muijeres, well, I guess,|this is good-bye. Yes, good-bye. If he can have you two,|what would he want with a chica like me? Tomas needs intellectual stimulation.|- And culture. He wouldn't go for the...|- blond with the boobs... Would he?|- Would he? Romeo-meo romeo-meo rome-romeo rome-romeo Okay, Tomas. It's time to relax. Mi amor, I was|just thinking about you. Really? May I come in?|- Of course, my sweet. Where are my manners?|- Oh, I don't know. Perhaps you left them|in new york... or, maybe, Miami? Isn't it trueyou were in both|of those cities recently? Very recently, in fact. Uh, yes, for my work, amor,|- oh, your work. No other reason, Tomas? I don't know what you mean?|- I thinkyou do. Mi amor...|- no me toques, querida, go upstairs. I will make you a drink, okay? I'm gonna have|more questions foryou, Tomas! I'll be right there, What was she saying...|new york and Miami? Oh, my god! No way. No way. Now, stay calm. Breathe, Tomas.|Just breathe. Patricia, I was just|thinking about you. How could you, Tomas? I thought you had better taste|than a librarian and some sort of... a prostitute!|- What areyou talking about? Who are those drinks for?|- For me? Two drinks?|- Yes. So I don't have to come back for a refill. See? Mmm. Come into the kitchen.|I will fix two foryou. Federal express. I'll be right back. This can't be happening. Oh, my god.|It is happening. Ay, Cici!|- You've been very, very bad, cabron! Mamita.|- Take a good look at me, papi. Feast your eyes|on what you're losing and forwhat? It's not what you think.|- Some stuck up, pinche,,, ice princess and|a mousey little office clerk! I hope it was worth it!|- I can explain. Listen. Because you're don't get|these chichis tonight! Well, I'm back at this house,|but something funny is going on. Aha! You came back! I knew I couldn't|trust a tramp like you! You liar! Liar? Me? Your fake-eyed, funny-named,|culo crawled back before I did! What have you done to him! The librarian? I am a lawyer!|- Oh, you tricked us! I didn't.|- "And we deserve more than this," my ass! I did it...|- So you could have Tomas for yourself. Big word talker!|- I didn't plan to come back! It was just... damn it, it was Cici's chichis!|- Tramp! Pendeijas! Underachievers. Sounds like it's getting violent.|Wait. What are we doing? What are we doing?|- Trying not to kill somebody. Please don't kill me. I didn't mean to.|- Shh. Quinn-quinn... i can't hear anything. Leave your man wanting more.|- We're gonna need more than that, papi. I won't shareyou.|- Make a choice, Tomas, choose or you die. I choose... I... I choose. Tomas! What are you doing?|- I have to make sure he's okay! He might need c.p.r. If anyone's gonna give Tomas the breath|of life, it's gonna be me! Get your mouth out of there!|This dead chico is mine! Look at this. Look at this.|They were prescribed today! He took half of it!|- Oh, these are just tranquilizers. He'll sleep it off.,|- And what do we do now? What can we do? We're gonna wait here|till he gets up and he chooses me! I mean, he makes a decision,|all right? Deal? Deal.|- Okay. That's it. I got to get a closer look|I'll call you back. Hi, you've reached Tomas Fuentes,|please leave a message, Hi, it's me, What?|- I'm worried about you, and seeing it's my job to take care|of you, I'm bringing over what you need, and you better be I n bed|when I get there. The i.a. Woman. Her job?|- In bed? Wake up, Tomas!|- Come on, you cheating chico! Snap out of it!|- I'm gonna kill her! Wait until she finds out!|- She won't likeyou two... any more than you like me,|but I liked the odds... better when it was|just the three of us. She's here! She must've|called from a cell phone. This doesn't look so good. She's not that hot.|- Oh, my gosh, she has a gun, Let's get out of here!|- I'm not going anywhere without Tomas. Wait! She's going around|the back! Come on! Come on, fifi. Come to mama, baby. Come on! Come on!|Come on. Oh, no, not my coat! Probably bought|that to match the dog. Let's get going before she comes back,|- my clothes don't squeak! It's not my coat.|It's your stupid little rat! Come on, my little fluff.|Come on. What are those girls up to? Can you turn that thing off? The F.B.I. is close to an arrest...|- I can't! It's broken! She's following us!|- Hold on! I 'll lose that hootchie mama! "Hootchie mama"? Watch it, lady! Nice dodge! Admit it! Cicita|knows what she's doing! Okay!|Pero what do we do now? Yeah, we can't just keep|driving around here. I saw a motel 6 on myway into town.|- A motel what? We have to go somewhere.|- I once stayed at this fabulous hotel here. That's where we're going.|- As long as you're paying. Fine. Hello, ladies. Hello, may I help you with your bags?|- Yeah, sure, how we gonna get him inside|without making a scene? I won't carry him again. 'Scuse me. Ay, nice place! My mom loves these. Why don't you guys stay behind? I'll take care ofthis. Yes, I'd like a suite,|preferably on the top floor. I hope I have one on such short notice. We are so booked.|- I'm sure you'll find something. Here's one! We do have|one last suite available. Isn't that great?|- I'll take it. My pleasure to serveyou|"Miss coronado del pescador."' That's an interesting name,|- it's all taken care of. Well, good. Because Tomas|is locked in the luggage room. I am sorry|Miss coronado del pescador,,, but there seems to be|a problem with your card. That's impossible.|- Well, my computer says... that the account has been closed down|by the main cardholder,,, a mrs, coronado del pescador, is that your mother?|Would you like to try another card? She did it.|She real ly did it. My mother must be really mad. This would have been perfect.|Where are we going to go now? Don't ask me,|I have no money and no credit cards. Well, well. How the mighty have fallen!|- Oh, shut up! That's enough. We have to think|ofsomething beforeTomas wakes up... or somebody finds him.|- Jesus, are they cloning them?

Is there anything special|you all would like? I would love|a marguerita, please? Oh, now,|Miss Puerto Rico. You know that our pageant contestants|are not allowed to drink! Well, I'm sorry. She's ordering it for me.|She takes such good care ofher staff. Isn't that right, patty? Why don'tyou make it|a bottle of champagne? For my nerves.|- Thank you so much for everything. Oh, oh, oh! It's my pleasure!|My-my card! My card! If there's anything...|- Thank you. See you tomorrow. That was close.|- This is outrageous! Nice room, huh? I'm not talking about|the room, you peasant. They think that|she's Miss Puerto Rico... and I'm some sort of maid. If you don't like it,|there's the door. And leave you two|alone with Tomas? I don't think so.|- Where is Tomas? I don't know. Open.|- No! Hi.|Brought your bags. Oh, wow. What a room.|- The maid is taking care of it, as you can see. Okay, if there's anything you ladies|need or want or, you know, desire,,, I'm at your service, so just...|- Thank you. What's the matter?|You don't like the food? I'm just not very hungry. I guess losing all your money in one day|can make you lose your appetite. Here.|Have this. It'll numb the pain.|- I'm not really supposed to drink. Thank you. You're not really|in a contest. Thank you. I need to have a clear head. I have|round one with the judges tomorrow. No you don't. Miss Puerto Rico has|round one with the judges tomorrow. You have to sneak out of here|without being thrown in jail. I'm not breaking anylaws!|I couldbe Miss Puerto Rico, No, you couldn't!|- Why not? For starters, you're not|from Puerto Rico! You think those contestants are from|where they say they're from? Excuse me?|- I'm gonna tell you something. I heard Miss Venezuela,|she's really from Nicaragua. Help me out here, patty.|- Oh, don't ask me. I'm just the maid. So why did your mom cutyou off? Well, that's|none of your business. But Tomas had better choose me because I've|given everything up for that 'cheating chico'. Your parents cut you off|because of Tomas? Well, I sort of...|ran away. They just wanted to marry me off|anyways so... You ran away?|I'm impressed. Too bad Tomas|is gonna choose me. Over my dead body.|- Anyway you like it. Please. Please. We're stuck here|together for the night. Soon, Tomas is gonna wake up,|and he's gonna to make his choice. And I thinkwe all know|who that's gonna be. The one he really loves. The one that makes his heart...|bound in his chest. The one that he cannot stop|thinking about. A toast.|- To me! Oh, god. Isn't he... beautiful? If only all he did|was sleep. Why did you do it?|- 'cause he's man. That's so depressing.|- That's life, no? What do you do in Miami?|- I'm a cocktail waitress. I was thinking about|getting a job too. Anyway, I really|want to be a dancer, Ihe kind with the pole?|- No! A real dancer. Everything I know,|I taught myself. And that's hard to put on a resume. I know what people think|when they look at me, I may not look smart,|but I'm full of surprises. But what about you,|Miss Puerto Rico? How come you're a lawyer|and you have no dinero? Because I work for the people. What people?|- Our people, I fight the fight|for rights for all latinos, I fight against discrimination. I fight against inequality. I fight for the people|who have no voice! Que bueno, you should save that|for the beauty contest tomorrow. You know that I've... I've never been|in a beauty contest before. And you're|not in one now. Being a fake beauty contestant|is better than a fake maid. Tomorrow, can I be Miss Puerto Rico|and Lorena be the maid? And now, the moment|we've all been waiting for. And the winner is... Miss Lorena!|- Yea, Lorena! Way to go, Lorena! Come on, Lorena!|You're hot, baby! Lorena morales, do you swear|to be my only, my one and only... and nothing but my one and only|so help you god? I do! Lorena, yeah! You're my love,|and I won't share you with anyone. This is ridiculous. I should be going to the ball,|not those tacky, ugly hags. Help me with my dress! The buckle on my shoe is loose!|Fix it! Would you hurry?|I don't want to Miss the prince. May I have some water?|I am so thirsty from my travels. You got it, prince. Certainly. You're so very beautiful.|- I am, aren't I? And I'm wasting away|in this horrible dungeon. Would you like to ride away with me?|- More than anything. Let's go. My papi.|Yes, Tomas? How dare you?|- How dare me? How dare you!|- Keep your hands off the merchandise! Oh, you wish.|- Hello? Yes. Yes, Miss Puerto Rico. Correct. Oh, I'm sorry.|I'll be right down. what happened?|- I missed my brunch! Okay, I'm meeting the judges.|It's 11:30! It's 11:30? Move it. We have to go.|- Where? We have to take the car|to fala's boyfriend's friend. It's a long story.|- I have to meet the judges. No, you don't.|- And why should we go with you? Because we're in this together,|because we have a common bond... and because I don't trust|either one of you... alone with Tomas. Okay. Fine. Then,|I'll just go downstairs... and spill the frijoles|on little Miss Puerto Rico. I'm sure motel 6|will have a room. We're in. Well, what about Tomas?|What if he wakes up? Still out like a light.|- We'll leave Fifi here to guard him. Come on, Fifi.|Let me help you get your favorite toy. Good girl! This is so bizarre.|I could've sworn I put it in here. I have a better idea. Hotel security. Baby, I'm chasing papi,|chasing papi. Baby, I'm chasing papi,|chasing papi. Now we have to wait|for some guy named rodrigo. We have to wait? In this heat? Is the sun too bright for your pretty,|fake blue eyes? What's that supposed to mean? Only that someone in this car|is ashamed of being latina. I'm not ashamed|of being latina. I can't believe|I'm missing the pageant for this. You're not in the pageant! All right, all right.|There's the car. Let's go. Okay. Okay, just a minute.|- What? Just a minute. I gotta take these pills|before the novocaine wears off. You can't stand a little toothache?|- Shoot! It... it's a root canal. It's the most painful|thing you could have. Haven't you ever|heard of people saying... "rather have a root canal," when they|don't want to do something? No, but you would rather have|two root canals than to blow this deal. Look here, Victor.|Tonight is the night. We make this pickup,|and then we are in with the big boys. Are you almost finished? Let's... let's go.|- Okay. Okay. I'm miserable, you know?|You could be a little more sensitive. Ladies, you are late. Rodrigo. The last thing I picture you doing|on the internet is buying a car. Here. Great car.|Really roomy. The radio sticks a little bit. Where's the bag?|- What? Where is the bag? The bag?|- Where is the bag? The bag with the money. Oh, my god.|Was it supposed to be in the trunk? Look, don't play|with me, little girl. I object to you calling|her a little girl. And who the hell are you?|- I am a woman with a conscience. You're about to be a woman without|a pulse, if we don't get that bag back. It's back at our hotel. Yeah. I didn't know about a bag of luggage.|- Well, I don't. Why did you say it?|- I'm stalling. This is all your fault. What are they talking about?|- Okay, okay. Okay. Please! Break it up. Man! Please, okay? You know? Every time women|get together they go like this all the time. We're just gonna go|to the hotel, get the bag... and we're gonna|bring it to you. Yes.|- Not so fast, senorita smiles. Victor's coming with you. Huh?|- No, no, no. That's really not necessary. He coming too?|- Wha... I... Hey, hey, hey.|I gotta put ice on my jaw, okay? I really don't wanna take|a ride with them, all right? You know what? You are going, unless you|wanna stay here and explain this to the boss. And I know you don't|really wanna do that, do you? Nice move.|- Is that a plan? What are we gonna do when we get|to the room and there's no money? Yeah, then what?|- You got us into this mess. Here we are. There's a note! Here, I'll get it. I'll get it. "If you want your papi back, bring|the money to the don quixote puppet... at the L.A. Latin festival|at 5:00 p.m., no cops." No cops?|- L.A. Latin festival... this is all your fault.|- Why is everything my fault? It's not my fault.|- Hey, hey! Keep it down, please. Where is the bag,|because that's not the bag. It's full of underwears|and stuff. Where's the bag? We didn't have to leave|Tomas to return stupid car... you're Miss perfect.|Nothing is ever your fault! Shut up! Shut up|so I can think. Please! What? I live in new york.|No one touches my bag. It's like I'm seeing you|for the very first time. That was good.|- But where is Tomas? And who are these thugs|and what was in that car? I don't know,|but I'm going to find out. Conga room. Fala.|- Cici! I need to find|that jerk, Ricky. I don't know where he is. Are you in|L.A.? Have you see the Hollywood sign? He set us up. Do you know about a bag of money|that was supposed to be in the car? No. Ricky wouldn't|do anything like that. He doesn't have any money.|Have you seen any movie stars? I don't have time for this. Good-bye.|- Take pic... Well?|- Well? We have to find out|how to get to this festival. Miss Puerto Rico!|We've been calling and calling! I was so worried! I love your glasses!|But this is a beauty contest. Lose them! It's just you and me. Let's go. Excuse me! We need|a map of the area. How nice to have you back.|Shall we give it another go? That was just a little misunderstanding.|- Of course. What about the map?|- Whose adorable dog is that? Hotel policy does not allow... our four-legged family members to stay with us.|- Fifi, what's wrong? Oh, I've seen a lot,|but this one's a real doozy. No, I think he'll prove|very useful to us. Yeah. Okay,|I'll see you there. I'm just gonna make sure|they make it there too. Okay. Bye. And worldpeace. Excuse me. Miss Mexico,|how would you define beauty? I believe beauty|does come from within... but why not let your beauty|show on the outside... and share it|with the whole world? If you got it, flaunt it. And like the great daisy fuentes said,|"we must all express our salsa gene... "because it allows us to be... as beautiful as we are." Muchas gracias. Thank you, Miss Mexico.|Ah, Daisy Fuentes: Truly a voice of our generation. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure|now to introduce to you... Miss... Puerto Rico. Miss Puerto Rico! Hello. Fifi, what is it?|Come here. Come here. Aw, they let you have a dog? How nice.|- Nobody let's me do anything. I'm not a maid.|Not a maid. You know, you just|keep tellin'yourself that. I wake up every morning|and I say to myself in the mirror... "I am a musician." Fifi, what is it baby? Come here. Would you stop fooling|around with that dog? The money.|- The bag, it really was in the trunk. I put Fifi's toy inside, thinking it was|my bag, but really it was the money bag. It looks like my bag, but it was|last year's. The clasp is different. Sorry.|- We don't have time for this. Let's get Miss Puerto Rico,|and rescue Tomas. Oh, man... how can three|defenseless girls get away from you? I dunno what happened.|They pushed me. They kicked me. What?|- I don't know what happened! Victor, I'm not ready to die yet,|- I'm miserable. And if we don't get|that money, we're dead. Now look. We... we gotta|find these broads. Okay. Okay, Rodrigo.|Don't yell at me. I think they're|at the Don Quixote puppet. The Don Quixote puppet|at the festival? Yeah. I'll meet you there. When women realize that we|are the majority of this world... the possibilities are endless,|but it is up to us. I believe that as women...|- Check out the wonder bread. Excuse you. Come on. In every aspect|of our lives, right? How would you respond to those who say|a beauty contest such as this... does more for the object ifiication|of women, rather than women's rights? I say, what better way to show that a woman|can be both beautiful and intelligent? In fact, if chosen,|I plan to propose... that all beauty contestants|are required to take entrance exams. Absolutely! What the hell|is she talking about? Our goal, people,|should be to celebrate the diverse... and the wonderful qualities|of today's latin woman. We don't have time for this.|- In fact, I believe... Stop that imposter! I am the real Miss Puerto Rico. I'm so sorry. Just a little misunderstanding...|- and that's my... That wasn't very dignified|for a beauty queen. Anyway, what would tell me|to go see Tomas? I can explain this whole thing. We really don't have time for this.|- What happened? Whoo! What were|you doing up there? It was amazing, Cici. I really had them.|They were hanging on my every word. Girl, it wasn't words they were hangin' on.|- I learned from you. Lorena! Lorena! Hey, we found the money.|- Really? Let's go. We have to get|to that festival... or we don't know what's|going to happen to Tomas. I hope he's okay.|- We have to find a puppet... I'm losing my mind. Welcome back. Where am I? Who are you? Agent Carmen Rivera, F.B.I. F.B.I.? I-I-it... it's a federal crime|to date three women? No, but it should be. I'm missing out|on the whole contest. You're a liar!|Get over it! Yeah, focus, Lorena.|- Got the map? Got it.|- Floor it! What's happening?|- Buckle up, Romeo. We're going for a ride. Are you arresting me?|- No, you're just the bait. Your girlfriends|have something I want. You know what? I think|we're gonna make it. You know what? For a lawyer,|you make a hell of a beauty contestant. You know what?|I don't know what got into me. I never had that kind|of attention before. It was amazing! I bet if the real Miss Puerto Rico|hadn't shown up, you would have won. Stop it. You really think so?|- Definitely. You think so? You know what? For a cocktail waitress,|she's quite a mastermind. Street smart. You, patty, you can|really swing a lamp. I know. Yeah. Yeah.|- Thank you. Thank you. What was that?|- I don't know. What's happening?|- We're running out of gas! Cici!|- We're out of gas? And they were all there at my house.|Can you believe that? Well, you can't say|you didn't have it coming. Nothing like this|has ever happened before. What? Getting caught?|- No, falling in love with three women. Oh, love. You call it love, hmm?|- Si, like neruda... "I love in this way, because|I don't know any other way of loving." Oh, my god.|You gotta be kidding me. We're not gonna make it.|- Then we'll go to a gas station! There's a gas station. Pull into the gas station.|- I see the gas station! This isn't full service. This isn't full service.|- Are you out of your mind? Hurry! Hurry! Perfect!|- We don't have time for this. We need another ride. Are you with me?|- Ahead of you. You know how to do it?|- I don't know how to drive that thing. You don't?|- No! What would I... I thought you did. Why would I know how to drive a motorcycle?|- Why would I? 'Cause it seemed implied! Do you wanna argue,|or do you wanna ride? She doesn't know|how to pump gas... but she knows|how to drive a motorcycle. Vamonos!|- And she speaks spanish. Hold on, chicas! Sorry! We have to save|someone's lifie! Hey, wait! That's my bike!|- We promise to bring it back! Sad girls. Talkin' 'bout bad girls. Maybe through my childhood. I was raised by so many women. Mi madre, mis tias,|and three other sisters. That's interesting. That's why the amount|of women never seem to be a problem. That's it. That's it exactly! You understand.|You are so smart. Know what you need?|You need to spend some time alone. You shouldn't cover your beautiful eyes|with such dark glasses. Sit back.|- What? You have beautifiul eyes. I hope you girls know|that stealing is illegal. My mother's definitely gonna kill me this time.|- We're gonna give it back, okay? Yeah.|- Yeah, but first we save Tomas. oh, look! The hootchie mama's back.|She really wants Tomas! Go! Go! Go!|- I'm trying. Oh, my god!|There. Ooh, they all are... go, go, go! No! Wait!|- Lean! Damn. Your girlfriends pulled through. They must be tougher than they look.|- What? They're here?|- That's right. Right on schedule. Who knew?|- She should add Evel Knievel to her list of names. There's the puppet!|- Let's go! Let's go! Are they all together? Enjoying the festival? 'Scuse me, 'scuse me.|The cops! The note said no cops.|We can't take the risk. What's wrong with your face? My contact!|Help me find it! Do you see it?|Do you see it? Come on. Wait a minute.|I'll just take the other one out. You look so much prettier|without all the money. Thank you.|- I hope she can see. It's Victor!|- She can see. There's only one way out of this.|We can't let them catch us. Where are we going?|- Dancers. Dancers.|- We're not dancers. I don't know|if we should do this. This is gonna be easy. Just follow my lead.|- I can't do this! I won't do it!|I don't dance! Listen to me. This is the talent|portion of the pageant. Convince the judges that you|are the real Miss Puerto Rico. There they are. They're, like, ripping|each other's clothes off. I don't care what's goin' on. I'm through|messing around with these, uh, "machacas". Machacas, man? This is it. You're gonna dance|and you're gonna win that crown. It's a tiara.|- Whatever. I've had lessons, but I don't know that|I'm ready for the stage. In this case, less is more. They can't stay|up there forever. Yeah, you've obviously|never been to a salsa club. Cici, those were expensive! They look great. Are you sure about this?|- Yes. We're safe here. If we're on stage,|they can't get us. We're the dancers.|Sorry we're late. Lorena, dance!|Come on. Go! Move around. Back like this.|- Now what? I did it! Oh, my god!|- Good job. Yeah. I 'm ready. Ooh! Cici! Cici! Let's go! Let's go!|- Thank you! We gotta run. Come on. We gotta go.|- Whoever wrote that note still has Tomas and wants this money. Who are those guys, anyway? Grab my hands. Come on, Cici!|- They're coming! Hurry! Come on!|We have to get to the puppet. The note said 5:00. Stop right there! F.B.I. Drop the guns|and put your hands in the air. Not you. Throw the bag over there.|- What? Give her the bag.|That's the girl from the matrix. Oh, yeah. It is. It is the girl from the matrix, yo.|The black and everything. Shut up.|- Okay. Okay, please. Just don't yell. Please. Cuff'em.|- Cuff'em. Come on. Victor and Rodrigo|didn't get away this time. Oh, man! Hey, is anybody|taping this? Ow! Ow! Hey, listen. Can you tell your guys|to be a little less rough, you know? Please. That's enough. Get outta here.|- Read them their rights. We made it! We're alive.|- I didn't doubt us for a second. What a team!|- All for one, and one for all! Tomas!|- Tomas! Where's Tomas?|- Tomas! Good call not grabbing|the bag in Miami, Carmen. Those boys are gonna lead us|right to whitaker. And you to a promotion. So, that guywas dating all three of them.|- It's a long story. Hmm. He turned out|to be good bait. I knew the perps would follow their money|and the girls would follow their man. I drove a Harley, just like|you taught me. It was so cool. I was Miss Puerto Rico.|- She was so beautiful! I'm sorry.|I'm really sorry. I never meant|for this to happen. I fell in love|with all of you. I don't think|i could ever choose. Choose? Tomas, I have been out of control|for, like, 36 hours now. I've finally broken|free of my parents. I know what's best for me. So Fifi and I, we're|gonna go it on our own now. Sorry. Ayayay, Tomas.|What you did was very wrong. But I 'm gonna thank you, because I've|done things I've never dreamt of doing. I realized that|I don't need you to feel sexy... and to have fun with my life, so if|you're thinking of choosing me, mm-mmm. Don't. And you, Cicita? Ay, papi. Suddenly it seems|like I can do anything. What I really|wanna do is dance. I think the world|is ready for me now. So I don't think|I need you either. I'm sorry. Good-bye, baby! Tomas, it looks like|they made the choice for you, huh? Yeah. I'm taking your advice, Carmen. I'm going to spend|some time alone. Good for you. But before I do... would you|like to get some dinner? Dinner?|- Yes. Is that another one of your lines, Tomas?|- No more lines. Just food. Well, I am kinda hungry.|- I'm starving. Can I drive?|- I don't think so. I'm going dancing more often.|- I see you. I love that move you did.|- Which one? Tusabes the one with the hip...|- Ay, no. Hey! Come up here. What, us?|- Nooo. Yes, you. Come up here. Ay! No, no! Lido deck. Cici, it's for you. It's time. Hello, girls. Hey.|- Greetings from the Lido deck. You go first, Cici.|- Paradise. Sun and fun all day. Three shows|a night. And the sailors... I can't believe you're|getting paid for that. Ay, this from someone|who's never had a job. guess where I am right now.|- Where? Buckingham palace.|- My new apartment. No!|- Good. Our girly's out on her own. Not only that, but I started|my job at the gallery yesterday. The work place will never be the same.|- Probably not. What about you, Lorena?|- Let's just say that every weekend... I am the queen of tango!|- No! Let me see for cancer. Cancerian... oh, the moment|of your life. It's your turn. Love is closer|to you than ever. So go outside the door,|because love is waiting for you. Don't get me wrong|I still wanna fall in love real hard. If it's real|and for the right reasons. And I'm my own boss. Some wanna come|and steal my heart. But I don't need a man. Though I'm still hoping. I know what I need is|to come from the inside. If it's real|and for the right reasons. And I'm my own boss. Some wanna come and steal my heart. But I don 't...
