You're new here, that's why she's giving you really a hard time. You're right... I don't know why it's so difficult to update her. I'll better go... I still have to make rounds to Onco. Where are the results? Doctor I had x-ray results and it seems that... they... I should... I'm asking about the laboratory results! How is his hemoglobin... I receipt... how is the status of his PDD! I'm sorry doctor. I'll follow it up in the laboratory. With that kind of attitude, you will not last here! You're a doctor... you should be professional. And besides... if you can't follow the hospital's policies... you are free to leave anytime. You are not a big loss. There are many pretty and intelligent doctors here. What a way to start the day. Good that you all come. We have not seen for a long time. You were not visiting me lately. So, how are you? We're okay aunt. We apologize for not visiting you lately. We're just so busy. Of course, we will never forget this day... especially it's Beatriz' birthday. Beatriz is just like a sister to us. And you are like a mother to us all. Thank you Ana. Thank you all. You're like my own children. It's just sad that Beatriz is not around. Aunt, please don't think that way... You'll get even lonely. Besides, Beatriz wouldn't like you to be sad. C'mon, smile! And how are you aunt? I'm good. With God's help, I get by. Time went so past. It's been a year already since... never mind... I'm emotional again. I can't help it. I'm missing her. Aunt, we knew that already... don't worry, we are here. C'mon, that's enough before we all cry here. We are here to enjoy. Let's celebrate! Correct! Cheers! Cheers what? It's juice. That's okay. Cheers! Aunt, lighten up. Aunt... We will go now. If you need anything, don't hesitate to tell us. Okay. Just call us. Thank you. Your rice cake was really delicious! Aunt, you're the best! Okay, thanks. My daughter was lucky to have friends like you. Wait, where are Ana and Carlo? Carlo accompanied Ana to the CR. We'll go ahead now aunt. Bye and thank you. Please visit. Okay. Okay. Aunt, we're leaving. Alright. Thank you. Where's Ana? Aunt thank you. Thank you very much. We better go. Okay. Are you sure you'll be okay? I think so... anyway he'll take care of me. Yes I'm sure. Okay, go now. It's getting dark already. I'll wait in the car. What's wrong Ana? Nothing is here. Aunt... there's... No one's here. You're just tired. I know you had a long day. Get some rest. Thank you. Go now. As you can see, with our year end's profit... we will be able to increase our sales... up to 20% in the next six months. Mr. Tolentino, don't you think that we should double... our target cost for... by... 4? I think we have to set our standards from other companies. Considering the 4% mentioned by Ms. Reyes... would definitely be beneficial to the company's RTD. I agree with that. I'm sure our potential market will take notice. We do not need to give in to the advertising firms. This means, it will give us more savings. Exactly! Mr. Tolentino... I think you make a revision with your RTD. I'll be expecting that tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen... let's have our lunch first. Good evening sir. Good evening. Is mom inside? There inside, she has been waiting for you. Okay. Mom, you're drinking again. I thought... Carlo, you know very well... that this is my only source of relaxation. Why are you nagging me?. You didn't even treat your dad this way before. Is he boasting these Chinese antiques? Besides you are the eldest... you should inherit all of this. Look mom, look. I had a long day. I'm going to sleep now. I'm sorry. Okay Carlo, get some sleep. I know you're tired. Good morning doctor. Good morning Dr. Valencia. How is the patient in 3809? Yes doctor! I'm just making follow-up on the Plain LR. Very good! Very good! But it's not you whom I'm asking. Would you like to tell your buddy... to be kind enough to answer... and act like a doctor. She's asking if you would like to answer friend. Doctor I already increased the Dofamine dose... and the Plain LR is next for follow-up. That's what Dr. Santos and Dr. Salvacion told me. Let me remind you that we are all doctors here... and we should provide the best quality of care to our patients. Luckily I am pretty... and It makes my day beautiful. Goodbye! Bye doctor. Thanks again. That's nothing. She's at the menopause stage, and you know that. She's already old, that's why. But you look bothered lately. What's going on? Nothing. Maybe it's the duty hours and lack of sleep. I lack sleep too, but don't behave like that. I think I'm falling for Doctor Torres... imagine he asked me about the patient in the Onco. I am obviously assigned in the Pedia Ward. I have a feeling it's his way to get close to me... because he's falling for my beauty! Hey! You're not yourself again. I have been talking here and you're not listening. No. I'm listening to you. You just said that Doctor Torres... right? Doctor! You're needed in the emergency room! Give me the vial of Lasik stat! Hurry! Let's cover it in the album! Start ECG. Nurse, BP. BP, 50. Please repeat. Palpitory. Let's have ECG. Hook to Cardio Scope. Doc, OR stat please! Doc, palpitory. What? Why did you stop doctor?. My child! Doctor! Why can't you save my child? Please save her life. My child! What kind of doctor are you? You can't save my child! My child! My child! Who's there?. Who's there?. Hello. Ana, favor please. Where are you?. Always on duty? How can I reply? You talk so fast. What's the problem?. I'm just kidding. Well, actually, I'm having a good time, a little fun. You know... I was so stressed. A little fun? You go out almost every night! Never mind! So, now you know, I will sleep over. You used me as your excuse again. You know, I will be answerable if aunt finds out. Okay, you can't say I'm not concerned. What time are you coming? I'll be there in 15 minutes... I'm about to ride the taxi. Okay. Bye, see you. Okay, take care. Why? What? What happened? There's... What? There's someone beside you. What, beside me? There's no one beside me. Kris, there's someone beside you... - and even singing with you. - Don't scare me. You're crazy. I'm not scaring you Kris. There's really someone beside you. - He's even singing with you. - You know, you're only tired. Do you see anyone beside me? There's no one, right? Go to sleep now. You must be tired. You should have told me earlier... that you don't approve me sleeping here. What can we do? I'm already here. Go back to sleep, you're just tired. You drive me crazy! You want to win a best actress award?. You're overacting again. Go to sleep! So, we're okay with this?. Bro, If chance favors us, we will earn a lot from this. Yes bro. That's why I chose you... I trust you in this project. By the way, I have to go now. I'm so busy in the office. Actually, I'm waiting for Kris. She'll be here in any minute now. Hello Kris. Yes. Sorry, I will be late. Super traffic. - Anyway, I was with Ana... - Really?. Yes. That's why I need to talk to Carlo. Okay. Is he there? Let me talk to him. Sure. Why? Hello Kris? Hello Carlo, have you already talked to Ana? Not yet. Why?. Is there a problem? According to her, weird things are happening to her. I don't know, I can't explain... and she can't understand either. But I think, she needs you now Carlo... You take care of her. Go and talk to her. I'm sure, she needs you Carlo. Yes, I will. Later, I'll drop by in the hospital. I'm just quite busy... but... I will... Here's Mig. Thanks Kris. It's okay. Dr. Ana, you have visitor. You're the pretty one. Okay, I'm almost done here. There you are again. Thanks. Let's go. Hon, thank you. For what?. For the flowers. C'mon, that's nothing. I love you. I love you too Hon. By the way, Kris talked to me. She told me about the weird encounters you have. That's why I came here to check on you. Hon, it's okay. Carlo, don't you think, Beatriz has already forgiven us?. Forgiven? By Beatriz?. I don't remember us doing something wrong... or anything against her that we should be sorry for. I just thought maybe Beatriz... might have something to do with what's happening to me. Why Beatriz? She might have the answers. Ana... we did nothing wrong to Beatriz. Don't think that way. Get some rest. I know you're just stressed. So, family business?. Yes. It's a little hard, but I enjoy it. That's okay as long as you enjoy it. Sorry, I'm late. Hi Beatriz! Carlo, this is Beatriz, Beatriz, this is Carlo. Hi. Don't let this happen... I love you not her. No, Carlo. I can't afford to hurt her. Please, not like this... I love you very much. I'm sorry Beatriz. I hope you understand. Carlo, please, don't leave me. I beg you! Beatriz... Thank you Beatriz. I understand. Im not leaving I'll just be around. Laida! Laida! Laida! Laida, call an ambulance right now! Hurry! Ana. Carlo! It's Beatriz! Excuse me, is Ana here? She's not here. Carlo! You came by, Ana is not here. Is that so? Isn't she on duty today? I am unable to reach her. Maybe, her phone is low battery. She's supposed to be on duty. But she called that she can't work today. To take care of some important matters. I'm sorry Carlo, I really have to go. I have a patient waiting Okay? Thank you Dr. Cathy. Thank you. Take care. Ana. What happened? We found you in the living room unconscious. And we also saw this outside. Tell us the truth. Are you planning to set a fire? You're becoming weird Ana. Give her a break! You saw what happened. Sorry. Ana... is there a problem? Nothing. I'm just tired from work. We have a brownout a while ago that's why I got that candle. But don't worry about me, I'm okay now. Are you sure? Just tell us if you need anything. Maybe, you're just tired. Take a rest. You know what? I just take a day off from work. I'll take care of you. Don't bother Hon... I'm okay and I'm going back to work tomorrow. Don't worry. I'll be fine. There's someone who can help you. You could trust her. I'll take care of it. Thank you Cathy. There's something bothering me. I want to tell Carlo but he might not understand. Besides he's also stressed at work... and I don't want to be his additional burden. I know, I understand. But be careful Ana. You have no idea what you're getting into. That is difficult. Yes, I know. But I have to understand why this things happen. And as long as it does I'll never be at peace. Thank you for this. That's nothing. You're Ana? Come. Souls has no concept of time. They are not aware of what's happening. Many of them dwell with us. They are just around us night and day. There are a lot of troubled souls. They wanted to leave... but they can't... because they are destined to remain in the world of the living. How long since you friend died? About a year. It's been a long time already... she would had made her presence felt long time ago. Time does not determine what the soul feels. For us, what happened was over and done... but for them, it only just began. Why do you think your friend is haunting you? Have you done something? I'm not really sure. The only thing I can think of... is when Carlo become my boyfriend. She likes Carlo. But Carlo loves me even from the start. That's the reason why I suppressed my feelings for Carlo. But I know Beatriz understands me. That's why I tried to talk to her. Beatriz! Beatriz! If you are here make me feel your presence. I beg you Beatriz. I just want to help you. You should not have done it! There are certain things that we are not supposed to meddle. Ana... You have the ability Ana. You have the power to see things ordinary people can't see. But, you are not aware of it because you're fighting it. You're avoiding it. You are not supposed to do that... because it's a wonderful gift that you must accept. What do you mean?. You are not supposed to intervene the course of time. You have the strong ability Ana. The soul won't stop haunting you. It could be anyone friends, family, relatives. They will haunt anyone. I can't imagine why... but... but while I'm telling you these... I saw... I saw the images... You opened the portal Ana! You let them in! He he he... you're so cute just like me. Do you remember me?. I was you're classmate in Physics. Oh, I remember... there will be some light maintenance work right now. Where's the flashlight? Where's the flashlight? Hey! That's enough! Check out the time. You think working overtime will make you rich?. What do you care? You're pestering Miguel. He'll get rich for sure. He's always the Employee of the Month. - What about you? - I hope we all get rich here. Don't expect. Wait, Ding wants us to go to Sea Wall, what do you think? That's right Miguel, I forgot to tell you. Are you coming? Game? Let's go! I'll pass. I have to go home early. I am expecting a call from my brother in London. - Pass again? - Sorry. I can't miss my brother's call. That's a pity. So, we'll go ahead? Are you sure you're not coming with us? Yes. But I'll go next time. Promise, I'll make up to you. That's a promise?. Yes. Okay, Let's go! Just take care. Let's go! I'll just get the trash. Go ahead Romy. Romy! Just leave it there, I'll take care of that. Romy! Don't wait for me. Romy?. Romy! Romy! Hon. Hon. I'm sorry for not telling you right away. I'm not yet so sure about everything. I'm scared Hon, I'm sorry. Hon, don't worry. You're not doing anything wrong. I thought by doing that... I would be able to the find the answers but I was wrong. I just want to this to end. Hon, I'm scared, what if Beatriz do something bad? What if she get back at us? We don't know anything yet. So, we're not sure. Hon, we don't owe Beatriz anything... because we've done nothing wrong. What we can do right now is to be careful? You have to be strong Hon. God will take care of us. Kris, what happened? Ana, what's happening to you is also happening to me. Ana I saw it in my room at home last night. You saw it too? Not just her Ana. I'm not yet sure, but I heard and felt something too. I really don't understand why you two are experiencing the same. What do you mean?. You know, those unusual things I am experiencing... those stories that I can't explain. I tried looking for the answer behind this. Remember when Carlo found me unconscious?. I was trying to communicate with Beatriz then. Third eye? You didn't know even before? I wasn't aware about such things then. And I didn't know I have this ability. But, Kris, Miguel... Beatriz is back from the dead. She's the one haunting us. But why? I can't think of something we did wrong? Could it be your relationship with Carlo? What I know... Maybe... but I can't think of other reasons. Right now, there's nothing we can do... except to be careful and pray. Just call me if you experience anything unnerving. Yes. My God what did you do? I have been dreaming about her. But she's not telling me anything. Aunt, she's haunting not only me but also Kris and Miguel. What's she telling you?. Nothing, I don't understand. We just felt her and I'm really scared. Something might happen that's why we came here. My God! My child! What do you want? Why can't you rest in peace? Aunt! Be careful! Be careful! Aunt! Aunt! Ana we should be careful warned Beatriz! My God! Hello! What time I'm going to be there? What? Okay, fine. I'll be there in 30 minutes. Miss? Miss! Miss! You need to be careful. She's here already Ana. You called... B... Where is it now? Where is it now? Hon, Miguel called me up, our fears are realized. What do you mean?. Something happened to Kris. What? She was found in the CR. She's gone Ana. How?. Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee... Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee... Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit thy womb Jesus... Idang? According to the book of superstitions... there are certain rituals to pay respect for the departed. Each departed has a guardian. If you fail to follow the superstition... they will punish you by taking the souls of the living. When you tried to communicate with Beatriz... and by not following the superstitions... you called upon their guardians instead. They are the ones haunting you Ana. It's not Beatriz. It's not Beatriz? What should we do? How can we stop this? The truth is... I don't know how to answer your question. All I can say is say, you have to be careful. We don't know who's going next. I have to warn Miguel and Carlo. Hon, have you talked to Miguel already? Yes Hon. He said, he's dropping by the funeral parlor... where Kris was brought. What about you Hon, I've been calling you... I'm worried about you, I'll pick you up. Don't bother Hon. I went there already. And don't pick me anymore... I'm going back to the hospital now. I also have to check on a case there. Are you sure Hon? Yes Hon. Just stay with Miguel. Come to the hospital after the wake. And please be careful, we don't know who's next. Let me know If anything happens. What's going on Hon?. I'll tell you later. You will know soon. Okay, I have to go. Bye, bye. Hello Carlo. I need to talk to you and Ana as soon as possible. You need to know something. Is that so? Ana is not with me right now. But, okay, I'll go there. Thanks. Since Beatriz's mourning after... she never stops haunting me. She even appears in my dreams. What do you think she's coming back to us?. Is there something she wanted to tell us? She's telling me in my dreams about the "superstition"'. Superstition? About what? Don't you think that this superstition... has something to do with what's happening?. That's possible! Things are getting clearer now. Beatriz has something to do with everything right? Since the morning after, a lot of eerie things occurred. Let's not wait for terrible things to happen. Aunt... Kris... is gone. What? But how?. She was found inside the CR of a bar. I think this has something to do with her death. Ana did you give something to the dead before she was buried?. Rosary! I put a rosary to Beatriz' hand before she was buried. That's the curse! That's the superstition that you did not follow... that's why all these are happening. You need to get the rosary Ana. Break it to end this end now. They won't stop until they get what they want. Hello Ana, we are here with Aunt Soledad. What? Why? How is she?. Beatriz is haunting us, we thought of coming here. This might help. Alright, If aunt is okay, you come right away. Just hurry! Carlo, I know now how to put an end to this. It's the rosary! We have to destroy the rosary. I gave to Beatriz when she was buried. That was the last superstition. Carlo, you and Miguel should stick together. Take care. Okay, bye. Aunt, I know now the answer... everything has something to do with the superstition. This is causing a lot of misfortunes. It was the rosary given to Beatriz by Ana. We need to get and destroy the rosary. I understand. This is what we have to do to put an end to this. You go ahead, I'll just follow. Ana is waiting for you. Just call us if there's problem. Thank you. God will guide us. Go, hurry! Okay. Excuse me, where's the canteen?. Down the stairs, near the lobby, then turn left. Okay, thank you. Ana! I saw the guardian! I saw it! Laida! Laida! Laida! Laida! Laida! Laida! Lai... Laida! Laida! Laida! Ana, we have been calling aunt Soledad... but we can't contact her. She might be in the cemetery already. We have to end this now. Don't worry Ana. Now that we know already how to break the curse... this will be done. What is really happening? The guardian is behind all of this. Carlo it's my fault. I accidentally called and awakened it when I attempted to do sance. And we did not follow the superstition that's why Kris died. Carlo, I promise, I'll fix everything tonight... this has to end. It's the ritual in the superstition that you didn't follow. We need it. It has to be destroyed. We have to take it back in anyway we can! It's the only way to end the curse and stop the guardian. Carlo! Kris! Kris! Ana! Ana. Miguel! Miguel! Ana! Don't! It's the ritual in the superstition that you didn't follow. We need it. It has to be destroyed. We have to take it back in anyway we can! It's the only way to end the curse and stop the guardian. Carlo!
