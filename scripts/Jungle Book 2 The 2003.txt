This is me and Bagheera, the panther who found me in the jungle. He's a good friend. But my best friend of all was good ol' Papa Bear. Man, we had some crazy times together. And when the monkeys grabbed me, things got really crazy. Monkeys! Bad monkeys! Bad! Go, Papa Bear! Then I came face to face with the meanest, scariest tiger in the whole jungle, Shere Khan. You stay away from Mowgli, you mean old tiger, or I'll tie some fire to your tail and burn your butt! I got him, Mowgli. Did you see? You sure did, Ranjan. But it's gonna be hard to finish the story now. But we all know how it ends. Shanti blinks her big, beautiful brown eyes at you, and you follow her into our village. - I did not. - Did so! - Something was in my eye. - Both of them? Well, you were so ugly, you made my eyes water. Well, you... Now, now, we give thanks for Shanti's beautiful brown eyes. Without them, Mowgli would never have come into our lives. Come to think of it, you used the same trick on me. And you still fall for it. Thank you for a wonderful story, Mowgli. - Goodnight, Mowgli. - Night, Shanti. Watch out for Shere Khan on your way home. You and your stories. Everyone knows tigers don't come into the village. Tigers go wherever they want! Goodnight, boys. Tomorrow's gonna be so great. Erm... nothing. Uh-huh. Well, you'll need plenty of rest for doing nothing tomorrow. Off to bed. We never get to stay up late. Even wild beasts need their sleep. Help! Ferocious tiger! Goodnight, my little wild thing. Goodnight, Mowgli. Happy dreams. Erm... Goodnight, sir. Why do you always call him "sir"? His name's Pop. Hmm! Come on, Mowgli, wake up! It's morning. You said we'd go to... Ranjan. You want to wake the whole village? When does the tiger roar? I don't know. After he catches his prey. His prey. Let's go get our prey. - Boys? - Huh! Where are you going so early? To... do our chores? Not without breakfast. - That's OK. We're not hungry. - Got to go! Boys! Where are you going? - To do our chores! - Bye, Pop! See you later. Remember, don't cross the river. You can take the boy out of the jungle. But you can't take the jungle out of the boy. Yes. That's what worries me. - Hey, Shanti! - Ah! What are you doing here? Getting water. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm on the lookout... for danger. Danger? Please. There's no danger around here. Well, keep this just between us. Yesterday, I saw tiger tracks. Tiger tracks? Right. It's Shere Khan. I hear he's looking for me. Seeking his bloodthirsty revenge. So keep your ears open, and always watch your back, or the last thing you'll ever hear is... When does the tiger roar? You're horrible! Horrible, stinky boys. Come on, Ranjan. He's a bad influence. Now, don't move. That wasn't very nice, you know. Stop that. You're not a jungle boy. Why are you so scared of the jungle? - Because it's dangerous. - Dangerous? But Mowgli says... You shouldn't listen to everything Mowgli says. But I thought you liked Mowgli. Well, I do. I like Mowgli. But I have... oh. Er, you left this at the river. Thank you. She's in a bad mood. Hey, Ranjan. You want to see a little trick I learned in the jungle? That's a pretty good trick. Well, here's a little trick I learned right here at home. Wow. That's a neater trick. Like I said, Ranjan, don't listen to him. She's right, Ranjan. Don't listen to me. Listen to the jungle. Can you hear it? Yeah. The jungle. Yeah, man. And when you hear that rhythm, you get a crazy feeling inside. That morning sun peeks over the mountains And all the rhinos rub their eyes When they hear Hear what? Hear the jungle rhythm Those birds are tap-tap-tappin' the tree trunks The busy bee hums as he flies Loud and clear To the jungle rhythm Now you can hightail it out of the jungle But it never leaves your heart First you feel that beat start bubbling under Then you hear the tom-toms loud as thunder It's moving me Sounds a lot like being free When you feel Feel the jungle rhythm Feel the jungle rhythm Come on, Shanti. Can't do without rhythm And when it fills the air Animals everywhere Join in the dance You'll dance along with 'em Feeling it steal your soul - We'll stomp our paws - Flap our wings Maybe do one or two crazy things - Khan khan. - Yeah, that's it. Shanti, try this. Not quite. There we go. No. Take a look. Perfect. Check out those chattering monkeys Swinging through the banyan trees Two by two To the jungle rhythm Sounds like a wolf pack way in the distance Singing pretty harmonies Woo-woo-woo To the jungle rhythm That's it! Now you can hightail it out of the jungle But it never leaves your heart First you feel that beat start bubbling under Then you hear the tom-toms loud as thunder It's moving me! Sounds a lot like being free - When I feel - When I feel, when I feel Feel the jungle rhythm Wait. Wait stop. You're crossing the river. Mowgli, you can't go in the jungle. It's dangerous. Mowgli! Stop! Shanti, what is it? Children, come inside this instant. All of you. Mowgli. That includes you. I am very disappointed in you. You put everyone in danger. You know you're not allowed to cross the river, yet you disobeyed me. - But... - No, Mowgli. The jungle is a dangerous place. I should know. You are confined to your room without dinner. That should give you time to think about what you've done. Mowgli, I was only trying to... Oh, you can hightail it out of the jungle But it never leaves your heart Oh, Baloo. Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities Forget about your worries and your strife Oh, yeah! I mean the... Do bah badda dadda de da dah Rum pah patta reet ta dah That bring the bare necessities of life Now, that's more like it! Look at you. Growing like the proverbial weed. Let's see if you still got it. Take it away, Little Britches. Poor fellow. I said, take it away! Well, this ain't gonna work. You just ain't Mowgli. I guess I got to get used to singing solo. He's just not getting over that... Oh, no. Not again. Baloo? Mowgli. Get out of here. Shoo! Now, don't worry. I'll take care of it. Baloo? Baloo? Oh, man. Bagheera. How's it wagging? This has to stop. You can't take Mowgli from the man village. The boy's future lies with his own kind. Aw, his future can wait. I miss my bear cub. It's not safe for him in the jungle. Shere Khan is looking for Mowgli. Let Shere Khan try something. We handled him once, we will again. - Baloo, don't push your luck. - Out of the way, Baggy. You're not going near the village. Later, Baggy. That's it! Hathi, plan B! Hup, two, three, four. Keep it up, two, three, four. Remember, men, our objective is full and complete containment. Prepare for Operation... Operation... Er, "Stop That Bear"? Very good, son. Prepare for Operation Stop That Bear! By the ranks or single file Over every jungle mile Oh, we stamp and crush Through the underbrush Will you please stop? Brigade, halt! Huh? I told you, Baloo, there's no way we're letting you near the man village. You ain't gonna stop me now, Baggy! Look out below! - Search the water! - This way. Nothing here, sir. Baloo. I've got him, Colonel! Confound it, soldier. That's a fish! Whoopsie. Disgrace to the uniform. Colonel! This log can't possibly support your weight! Balderdash! Why, my dear boy, back in '88, - in service to the Crown... - Oh, no. Not again. They don't make trees like they used to. Got him! Got him right here! Disguised as a panther, Baloo? It's me, Hathi. Put me down Sorry. Keep searching, men. He couldn't have gone far. - My toes are getting pruney! - Who are we looking for again? Confound it, man. We're looking for the elusive... Don't turn me in, little guy. I just want to see my bear cub. I won't. I miss Mowgli, too. This way, quick! Hey, thanks, kid. You're alright. Say, fellas, look who's coming. That's Shere Khan. - What'll we do? - Don't start that again. Lucky. Hey, Lucky. Yeah? That's the one we told you about. Shere Khan. Mmm! Shere Khan. You don't say. Hey, watch this. I got one for you. Oi, look at me! Look at me! I'm Shere Khan and my tiger tushie's been torched! Ask me if I can whup that tiger. Go on. Can you whup that tiger? I Shere Khan! Do you get it? Save me! Save me! I've been outwitted by 40 pounds of scrawny man cub! Help! I'm cracking myself up here. I don't know how I do it. Hi, kid. Mind if I drop in? Baloo? Oh, Baloo... Shhh! Papa Bear! Am I glad to see you. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? Feeling right for the first time in a while, that's what. Hey, kid. Show me you can still fight like a bear. Oh, Little Britches, you lost your touch. Mowgli, I've got something for you. Mowgli, it's me. I get grounded all the time. Ah. I'm sorry you got in trouble. Come on, man cub. Show yourself. - Come on! - Whoa! Mowgli? Come on. Stick and move. Help! Wild animal! Wild animal? Where? Let's get out of here. Help! What's that bear doing here? There's a wild animal in the village! What's the matter? There he is. Where are you going? No! Come back! You're going the wrong way! Whoa! A tiger! Don't let him get away. - No! - Get outta here! - Shanti, get indoors. - No, no. He's over... No! Shanti! Shanti, wait for me. A tiger. Come on, follow me! - Whoa! - Mowgli! Hold on, Mowgli. Mowgli! Mowgli, where are you? - Mowgli! - They must be in the jungle. Ah! The jungle! What a weird scene. Is that place always like that? You don't know the half of it. That village was terrible. All you hear is rules, rules, rules and work, work, work. Kid, watch your language. That's all they do! Washing, dressing, fetching, cleaning... I'm tired just listening to it. Sounds like they're screwy over there. I don't want to talk about it. Especially Shanti. - Who's Shanti? - Just a girl from the village. Hold on. Not the one that lured you into that village in the first place? Yup. That's the one. I knew it! I knew she was trouble! I tried bringing her to the jungle and she got me in trouble. Say again? I wanted her to see what fun we have. And she got you into trouble? - Yep! - Ooh, man. She thinks the jungle is scary. - Where'd she get that crazy idea? - You got me. Do my snake eyes deceive me? It's the succulent man cub. You're with me now, kid. Forget that girl. You're better off without her. You got everything you need here. And me? I got my old singing partner back. Then hit it, Papa Bear! Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities Forget about your worries and your strife I mean the bare necessities Old Mother Nature's recipes That bring the bare necessities of life - Wherever I wander - Where you going? - Wherever I roam - Oh, yeah. I couldn't be fonder Of my big home The bees are buzzing in the tree To make some honey just for me When you look under The rocks and plants Take a glance at the fancy ants And maybe try a few Thanks, Baloo. The bare necessities of life will come to you They'll come to you Oh, Baloo! I don't want ever to see that girl or that village again. Well, of course you don't. It's just us bears from here on in. Yeah, man. Hey. You remember everything I learned you? You bet I do, Papa Bear. - Nah-uh! - Huh? When you pick a pawpaw Or a prickly pear And you pick a raw paw Well, next time, beware Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw When you pick a pear Try to use a claw But you don't need to use a claw When you pick a pair of the big pawpaw Have I given you a clue? The bare necessities of life will come to you - They'll come to you - To me? I so despise these song-and-dance routines. Mowgli? Mowgli? Is that you? Mowgli? He's gotta be here somewhere. I swear... ...I shall never again associate... with man cubs. Where could he be? Why, the little... ...snack. Who is it? Who's there? Excuse me. Might I be of some assistance? Are you lost, little one? Are you hungry? I'm starved. Bad snake! Bad, bad snake! Ranjan? What are you doing here? You leave Shanti alone! OK, Ranjan, I think he's had enough. You're not getting away that easy. Ranjan, you're not supposed to be here. We have to get you home. No! Mowgli's in trouble and we're gonna find him. I can smell him. He's this way! Oh, OK. But stay close. We don't want to run into any more scary animals. Oh, stop that! Oh, mercy. Shere Khan? Anyone I know? I wish. Stupid man cub. Man cub? Did I say man cub? Well, you know... ...I'd love to stay and shoot the breeze and all, but... What's your hurry? No reason. I, I... Where is he? - Who he? - The man cub, Mowgli. I know you know. But I, I don't. Please don't insult my intelligence. It makes me irritable. Oh. He's not in the village. I know where he isn't. Now tell me where he is. Well, he's, he's... The swamp! He's at the swamp. - The swamp, eh? - Yes. Trust in me. He'd better be... for your sake. He is. He is. I'd take you there myself, but I'm afraid I'd slow you down. Indigestion and all. Mowgli! Ranjan! What is it? What on earth? Retreat! - Colonel Hathi. - Take cover! Oh, no. Not again. Excuse me. Pardon. Colonel Hathi, what is the meaning of this? Man is in the jungle. What does he want? Mowgli! Perhaps I was too harsh with the boy. Don't worry. We'll find them. Mowgli! Ranjan! Baloo. Uh! Almost got it, Baloo. Whoa! Them primo mangoes, always the hardest to get. Got 'em. This is the life. Heads up. Delicious. Hey, check this out. Hey. Not bad. Where'd you learn that? - Shanti showed me. - Shanti? No. I, I said wanti. I wanti another mango. No, that's not what you said. You said Shanti. No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. - Did. - Didn't. - Uh-huh. - Uh-uh. - I heard it. - Who cares about Shanti? It's just a stupid trick, right? Yeah, right. You don't need her, kid. You're with old Baloo now. What are you laughing at? What're you doing here, Baggy? Haven't you heard? Man is in the jungle. What do they want? They're searching for Mowgli. Mowgli? Perhaps maybe you have seen the boy. Me? Uh, no. Well, you know his future is in that village. Yes. I just wish I knew where he was. Yeah. Sorry. I wish I could help you out, Baggy. Enough games, Baloo! Give me the boy. Baggy, Baggy, Baggy. I can explain. I can explain. I... I can explain, but I don't have to. As you can plainly see, Mowgli is not here. I'm all alone. I know he's around here somewhere. And he can't hide forever. Well, he won't get past you, Baggy. Kid? Kid, where'd you go? You trying to scare the tick out of my ticker? Wow. The whole village, looking for me? - We can't let nobody see you. - I thought they were mad. We got to lay low. They must really miss me. I wonder if Shanti's with them. Shanti? You definitely don't want her to find you. Do you? No. We can't let anyone find us, especially that girl. Come on, Baloo, we gotta get moving. Lay low. Hunker down. Hibernate, like. Now, Mowgli, what if that girl tracks us down? What are you going to do? Then you'll have to scare her. Scare her? Has the milk run out of your coconut? No, she's terrified of wild animals. In case you haven't noticed, kid, I'm no wild animal. Except at parties. I suppose I'm more of a honey bear. You can do it, Baloo. You taught me, remember? You scrunch up your eyes like this. And show your teeth like this. And roar like this. Roar? No, no. Like you mean it! Do you want that girl to take me back to the village? Yeah, man. That was great. Well, I don't know. Trust me, that'll do it. In that case, Mowgli, consider that girl scarified. - Thanks, Papa Bear. - Anything for my Little Britches. OK, let's skedaddle. Now don't worry. I got a place downriver. - It's the perfect hideout. - Real quiet, huh? Quiet? You want quiet, go back to the man village. This place is happening. OK, here's the village. We cross the river and... Ranjan, be careful! OK, we went right. No, no, no, left. Left, I mean. Right. No, left, then right. Oh! This jungle all looks the same! Ranjan, what's that? Mowgli? He must have been here! Or some animal with really sharp claws. That snake lied to me. Now, don't take it out on the water just because you don't like the reflection. I mean, not everyone can be born with such great looks. You let that tiger get his claws on you and you won't be so good-looking. What? That pussycat? He's harmless. Watch this. Oh, no. What's the matter, Stripes? Man cub got your tongue? Lucky, let's find something to do somewhere else. No, no. Hang on, fellas. I got another one. How many men does it take to whup a tiger? Surprise me. None. A little kid can do it all by himself. - Come on, Lucky, let's go. - Come on. In fact, we heard that kid is right here in the jungle. Right under your whiskers. Interesting. I heard he's headed back to the village. Wrong again, kitty. No, Lucky, keep your gob shut. They say he's headed downriver, with a bear. Downriver, you say? Don't listen to him. Yeah. He's new around here. He don't know anything On the contrary, he seems to know quite a lot. Hold on, hot pants! Where's the fire? Isn't it ironic that your name is Lucky? Come on, lads, this way! This is the perfect hideout? This is King Louie's place. Was, kid, was. He's splitsville. Me and the monkeys turned it into the greatest secret hideout ever. Coming through. Hey, Baloo. Good to see you back again, man. - Everybody knows about it. - Then how can it be a secret? I mean, everybody who's anybody. Nobody who's nobody don't know nothing about no place that everybody who's anybody knows about. You dig? My head hurts. Turn the thinker off a minute and just dive in. Step aside, and I'll show you what a real rug-cutter can do. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the boss of bop, the jack of jive, the jungle cat who's really gonna keep it alive. Get ready to stir it up and serve it up. I'm talking about Baloo is in the house! Hey, cats, alright! When we start to move Hey, honey, it ain't no joke We got a savage groove We didn't learn from human folk No human folk Excuse our incivility We're W-I-I-I-L-D When the music plays All the people stomp their feet But a stomping paw Can lay down a better beat Tell me we ain't naturally W-I-I-I-L-D It's a snap To bring out the beast in you You're free like the bird it's true Or a frog or a hog or... Oh, man, whatever! From the baddest cat To the sweetest little deer Tonight's the night We're gonna get our tails in gear Show me your ferocity Go W-I-I-I-L-D We snort, we squeak Up high or deep underground We snarl, we shriek We fly round and round and round Ah, go, you sweet thing. That's inhuman, baby. The old mongoose Gets good and loose The ocelot gives it all he's got The parakeet Goes, "Twiddlee-deet" The red macaque Shouts "Hang on, Jack!" - The tiny worm - The pachyderm - The spotted cat - The water rat - The great cuckoo - The bear Baloo Are W-I-I-I-L-D Here's the thing! If we're broke, we never squawk We don't need to check no clock To know what time it is It's time to rock When you dance like that Hey, honey, it sure is hip I can't stand it! I want to tip my hat But I got no hat to tip I don't need no hat. Ask me why and I won't lie I'm W-I-I-I-L-D We grunt, we growl Up high or deep underground We hoot, we howl We fly round and round and round My oh me, it's plain to see We're W-I-I-I-L-D He, she, me, uniquely W-I-I-I-L-D Every beastie running free W-I-I-I-I-I L- D! Whoo-hoo. That's my boy. They don't swing like that in your man village, do they kid? Well, no. Big fat no. Say, what that village like, anyway? Whoa, don't bother the kid. He told me all about that scene. Let me lay it out for you. Those people are crazy. Everybody works and nobody plays. Oh, man! They got nothing but rules, rules, rules. And there's even this girl who thinks the jungle is a scary place. But, you know, it doesn't matter, cos Mowgli will never see that village or that crazy girl again. Ain't that so, kid? Mowgli? Mowgli? Mowgli? Mowgli? That morning sun Peeks over the mountains And all the rhinos rub their eyes When they hear Hear the jungle rhythm Did we find Mowgli yet? Are you tired? A little. I'm sure we'll find him soon. Come on. Hop up. You OK up there? How could it be Half as good as being free? Part of me Like the jungle rhythm Like the jungle rhythm - Did you hear that? - Hear what? It sounded like Mowgli. - Mowgli! - Ranjan, wait! Mowgli! Shanti? Whoa! Are you OK? Oh, I feel "vine". What are you doing up there? Hold on. I'll be right... - I can't believe I found you. - I thought I'd never see you again. You out here, kid? Hey, Little Britches! Mowgli? You're not really helping. - Ranjan, stop pulling. - It's her. That wild bear that carried you off. What wild... Baloo, don't! No! Roar. My poor sneezer. That hurt. You come anywhere near Ranjan and I'll really show you hurt. - Wait! - Don't make me do it. Wait. Calm down. It's OK. But he's attacking us. Attacking? I'm the one socked in the schnozzle. That's because you scared her. But, you told me to scarify her. - What? - No. Wait a minute. Mowgli, you planned this? Well, I... - Come on, Ranjan. - Shanti, I can explain! Don't even bother. Shanti, wait! Man, you weren't kidding about her. She's bad news. No, she's not. She was helping and you scared her. Man alive! First, you tell me to scare her, then, you tell me not to. Kid, I only got so much room in this noggin, and it's filling up fast. You just don't understand. Alright, how's about laying it out for me? Read you loud and clear, kid. You wanted that girl to find you. Oh! Shanti! Shanti! Where are you? Come on! There you are. I'm so sorry. Will you let me explain? Come on, at least talk to me. You seem surprised to see me, man cub. I can't imagine why. I wasn't going to let you get away with what you did to me. You see, you humiliated me, man cub. Surely you do realise I simply can't let you live. Run. Oh, you're going to try and outrun me. How droll. Come on. This way! Alright. Stay here. Mowgli, no! Wait here. I have to help Mowgli. But I want to help Mowgli, too! No, I'll be right back, I promise. Don't move. Whoa. Hold still. Calm down, kid. Where's Mowgli? Shere Khan. Shere Khan? Hold on! Whoa! Whoa! No matter how fast you run, no matter where you hide, I will catch you. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Hurry! Hurry! Faster! Faster! Not another man cub. Can't you go any faster? Baloo! What is the meaning of this? - Mowgli's in trouble! - Shanti, too! Who's Shanti? Take the kid! I'll help Mowgli. Baloo! Be careful. Hmm? Mowgli? Mowgli, is that you? Mowgli? Uh! - You! Stay away from me! - You! Why are you here? - One of my den has a problem. - I spent a night in the jungle. I was attacked by a snake. But I don't care. - I'm here to help Mowgli! - I'm here to help Mowgli! - You what? - You are? I guess we're on the same side. I guess so. - OK. - OK. You go that way. I'll cover you. Oh, no. Well, isn't this a delightful turn of events? So, what's it going to be, man cub? You or your adorable little girlfriend? I'm waiting. One. - Two. - No, don't! Thr... No more games, man cub. - Mowgli! - Come on! Mowgli, look out! - Oh, no! - We can do it. Jump! Come on! Mowgli. Hello, Stripes. You're looking a bit down in the mouth today. Oh, no. What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? I always said you had a good head on your shoulders Khanny, me boy. This is fantastic, playing to a captive audience. I just love it. - Bagheera. - Mowgli. It's awfully good to see you, man cub. Come on, follow me! Bagheera, this is Shanti, my best friend from the village. Ranjan! Shanti! There they are! - Papa! Who-hoo! - Come on, Mowgli! Mowgli! Mowgli, I have to go. Shanti. Well? Come on, Mowgli. Er... Come on, Ranjan. Oh, Baloo. It's OK, kid. That girl isn't so bad after all, is she? Go on, Mowgli. Really? Really. Don't let her get away. Come with me. Now you know I can't do that. I'm gonna miss you, Papa Bear. Me, too, Little Britches. Me, too. Alright. There, come on, now. You'd better hurry up. Hey, wait! Mowgli! What took you so long? - Race you back! - Come on, Ranjan. Wait! Wait! - Shanti! - We've found the children. - Ranjan! - Mummy! You gave us quite a scare. Shanti, I was so worried about you. I'm OK. I'm so sorry. I was just trying to help Mowgli. I'm sorry, sir. It's just that... No, Mowgli. I'm sorry. I should have understood that the jungle is a part of who you are. I'm just glad you're safe. - Ranjan. - You won't believe it. There was a big old snake and I beat him up. Of course you did. I'm proud of you, Baloo. That was very brave... Now, Baggy. Don't get any ideas about running after him and trying to talk him into staying with us. He belongs in that village, and you know it. Oh, really? Yes, really. He's got his whole future there. I'm sorry, Baloo. You're absolutely right. I'm really gonna miss that kid. Me, too. Wait a minute. I'm having myself an idea. Baloo? Come on, Mowgli. We'll be late. OK. I'm right behind you. Just getting some water. - Alright. Be careful, son. - I will. See you, Pop. Let's see if he remembers to actually bring back some water this time. Hey, Shanti, let's remember to actually bring back water this time. Yeah, man! Man, that beat is chillin' me. - Hi, Papa Bear. - Hey there, Little Britches. Shanti! Ranjan? Ow! Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities Forget about your worries and your strife Yeah, man. I mean, the bare necessities That's why us bears can rest at ease With just the bare necessities of life Oh, yeah. With just the bare necessities of life One more time! With just the bare necessities of life Yeah, man! Can you hear it? Yeah, man. Now, I'm the king of the swingers The jungle VIP I reached the top and had to stop And that's what's bothering me I want to be a man, man cub And stroll right into town And be just like the other men I'm tired of monkeying around Oh, oobee doo I wanna be like you I wanna walk like you Talk like you, too You'll see it's true An ape like me Can learn to be human, too Whoo, baby! Yeah, take it away! Crazy man, crazy. Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Bop te roonee! - Check this out. - This place is happening! Can you hear it? Oh yeah. Step, step, step, step aside.

Hey, not bad. Sometimes when night has come The river sings a song In my dreams it seems to leave me Right where I belong Wandering everywhere Each way I turn is wrong How I'm wishing I could be there Right where I belong Smiles that have warmed me Arms that have held me Are all a part of who I am. It's never easy leaving your friends behind Missing them, loving them Someplace was meant for me And that's what keeps me strong Somehow knowing I'll be going Right where I belong Right where I Home where I belong Check out those chattering monkeys Swinging through the banyan trees Two by two To the jungle rhythm Sounds like a wolf pack way in the distance Singing pretty harmonies Woo-woo-woo To the jungle rhythm Now you can hightail it out of the jungle But it never leaves your heart First you feel that beat start bubbling under Then you hear the tom-toms loud as thunder It's moving me!
