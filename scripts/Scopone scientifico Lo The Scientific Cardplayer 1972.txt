They say that she has a private income of 20 million per day, but nobody knows for sure; the same goes for her age. I? Thanks, thanks. Madam, where are you coming from this time? In short, madam, you are traveling around the world chasing spring? Yes and that's what I suggest to women to keep young. Madam, where are you from? My father's father was Dutch, my mother Italian, my father was American... - Hold still, let me hear! ...Practically, I regard myself as a citizen of the world. During your stay in Rome, where are you based? Every year, in May, I rent a villa on top of a hill. A beautiful villa surrounded by a wonderful garden, I like it because as I open the window in my bedroom, I can see San Peter's dome. So I am really certain that I'm in Rome. It's facing a Roman "borgata", inhabited by poor people, with whom I get along. Madam, what are your hobbies? My only passion is playing cards, my chauffeur and I know card games from almost anywhere in the world. Your preferred game? It's Italian,; it's called "scopone scientifico". It's an ancient game, I believe, very clever, terrible, ruthless... - Let's go, come with me. Then we do not wish you a good stay, but good card games. We broadcasted: "Roman news, arrivals and departures". Grab, keep the baby. Can you give me a coin? - Here. Are you calling your mother? - Yeah. Can you insert it for me, I can't reach it? Antonia, your daughter is on the phone. Hello, it's mom here, what's up? Really? Who told you that? Listen, take the mothballs out of the suit, go to Elide and ask for the shoes. Yes, I call papa, yeah, yeah, I call him, bye dear, ciao. The oldie is back. More than this, as I'm loaded, I can't give you. But it is all good stuff! I don't need paper, I need iron, got that Cross-eyed? Gotcha, I'm gonna bring you the iron you want! Hey, how much you give me for this load? What? 1500? It's all top quality stuff, there are 200 KGs of paper, I don't need demijohns, I need iron! I want iron! - This is iron. Papa, leave him alone, let's go to S. Giovanni. No, have a rest, let papa negotiate. I don't want demijohns, I want iron, iron. Listen, iron fellow... let's do 1600? Give me 1600. OK, 1600. Papa, if you didn't give in so quickly, he would have given you 2000. You say so? Maybe he would have beaten us too. - He's there, Peppino? - Yes. - He's here. - The Maroccan wants to talk to you. The Maroccan? And what's he want? - Run, papa! - Yes, calm down, don't push, papa. If you want the stuff, you must give me 2000 lire. What do you want, who knows you? I can't talk right now; I have a business to deal with. Can I come in? Maroccan, did you want me? - Pe' take a seat, I wanna talk to you. - Here I am. I want to make you a proposal, that can change your destiny, and your children's. I am old now, my wife has died, I've got a swollen leg, I want to retire in the country. Great... in the country... And your warehouse? My warehouse... if you put you become the boss of it all. It's all yours. Maroccan... I must confess it to you... I dream of it every night, of becoming the boss, but when I wake up, I haven't got a dime. Where can I get 30 million? Pe', the oldie has arrived... The oldie? No, you can't have a funeral on credit, the hearse belongs to the City and you have to pay in advance. Uncle Osva'? - To die is really a luxury... - Hey, Cesari'? - Ahi papa, you hurt me. - You too? I got a hit myself. Give me the black suit of Uncle Osvaldo. - The oldie is here? - Yes, tonight we play! I give you the shoes too, so you look good. Good, the pointy ones, for ceremonies. No, you must pay the crowns in advance, my workers... This jacket is soaked with incense. Hi Uncle, thanks. Where are you going with the suit? Tomorrow I've got a funeral. What should I wear tonight at the oldie's? I'll bring it back tomorrow. Let's go, quick. Don't waste this chance, take her for lots of million... Take her for lots of million, to the oldie! Peppi', make it tough for this oldie! Come on Peppi'... Be calm, don't lose your head... Anto'! Anto'! She is back, at last, our old lady, you didn't believe it. What did I say, I was dreaming of her all nights. - Papa, papa! - The parcel, the parcel for mama... Anto', come there is a surprise for you! What have you done, what did you bring?! I've got an evening dress. No, stay calm... What are you doing, don't push! You're taking my hut down. Take Anto'! - But what is it? - This is a sign from destiny. - It looks like a curtain. It's a dress. Where did you buy it? It's all dusty. I found it while cleaning the countess' cellar. - Mama, do you like it? I found it! - Nice, very nice, it's all shiny. - Peppi', if tonight you ain't taking 10 million off her, tomorrow morning I'm going to spit on you. Go away! Don't confuse his head, tonight he is going to play, otherwise he makes a mess! It's 2 years I've been using a brace, I'm all in pieces. You know how it happened, the oldie's driver ran me over. But this time, if Peppino doesn't get justice, I'll take a petrol can and I'll set the villa on fire! Stay still! The two of you, stop playing and come eat - it's late! - Mama... - How is the new dress on me? You are a queen, my love. Papa, you have to take her for What? 20?! I'm gonna cut my hand off if I don't take her for at least 100! Who's going to claim the opposite, this time papa and I have trained all winter and we are unbeatable. Why are we unbeatable? Because mama and I love each other, we go along together. Just a glance and we understand each other. That's playing in pairs! That's why tonight we are confident. - Papa is right! - Love, have a rice ball... - No, do you want to be sick? Then you play badly. You are right; better be light. Hurry up, Anto'. The more we play and the more money we take her for... Don't forget - don't be late. If we win a bunch of million, we're going to wake you up, otherwise, we'll let you sleep. - Bye, goodnight. - Bye. - Bye. Cleopa', give a kiss to papa. Are you sad? Why, we are so hopeful, now that the oldie is here. Aren't you happy? Yes. - Good, that's how I like it. - Eat! Have a smile, Cleopa'. Please, love. At last! You are finally here. If it was just me, I'm always on time, but you know how women are, a bit flirtatious! Antonia had a bath, manicure, an evening dress... have you seen the fox stole, Pasqualina? - Yes, I saw it. Clean up your shoes. - But we came by car... Why did you come to the airport? Who knew it... we thought she was dead. No, she came back late because she got a disease in her legs. - Is she paralyzed? - Yes, she uses a wheelchair. Sometimes she is dizzy, she has lost her memory. - How does she play with no memory? - That's better, give your best, that you'll take her for lots of money, let's go! Let's attack her; this is the right time. Let's go! Entering here, it seems like a dream to me. - I had given up on it! Good evening, sir. Madam, may I? Too kind, don't bother. Are you new here? Yes, sir. This is the first time I've worked at this place. He's got a hook nose... maybe it will bring me luck. No, not the fur! Would you like a drink? - Maybe just... - Thanks, we are fine. - Yes... - I go to call madam. I just wanted a little French cognac... - Come here! - Tell me, love. I told you so many times that when they offer you a drink, you must say no. You get dizzy and you make mistakes. Rest assured; a little drop is not going to ruin me, you can sleep peacefully, Anto'! Let me have good cards... That's our battle ground! Our table... with the usual unsteady leg. Excuse me, do you have a wedge to put under the table leg? - Is a match all right? - That's all I need. Thanks a lot. Here... Damn it, now it's the other leg. I'm gonna saw you! Peppino, Antonia, where are my dear friends... how nice to see you again. - For us too, madam. Can I give you a kiss? - Certainly, my dear. Can I give you a kiss too, madam? Bring the cup out, Anto', let the lady see it. George, damn you... You lucky, always traveling... but you didn't forget about us? - No. Madam and I always recall our card games with you. Also at our place! Let's waste no time, I'm looking forward to starting. George, go and get the money. Yes, madam. Are you in top form? Madam, this year we are going to make it tough for you! Look at the cup, madam. Ah... Beautiful... Where did you win this cup? At the local tournament. Did you improve since last year? You won't believe it, out of 12 games, 12 wins! We won the parish tournament of scopone scientifico. What is it? A truck isn't enough... - Peppi', sit down. - Yes. Where did you spend the winter, Madam? In Papeete. Temperature was really fine, always like spring. We played poker, every day, with two Polynesian brothers. Did those savages manage to win any games? They always lost, because they are not rational. Of course, they're savages... Here madam. That's 10 million. Tell me Peppino, how is your business going? I get what you mean. Have I got some million to play cards with tonight? Just that... madam, because you... have arrived this afternoon. If I had the money, now banks are closed... Now I don't have cash with me... Anto', how much have you got? Not a single lira, love. You see... What can we do now? Don't you worry, it does not matter. We'll do as we have always done. Here is a million for you! - It's too much, madam. - Thanks, madam. No, you must take it. I insist, Peppino. I don't play for money... I play for... To dust my progress! George, what did she say? She said she plays to test her ability... of asserting herself. We too... We play just... for fun, right? Yes, for fun, we play. Shall we make it 50,000 per game? Madam, for me we can also do Oh God... what is it? - The cork! Pardon me. Haven't you ever served champagne before? - I thought he had a shot. - It's your turn, Peppi'. Here... 8 of "denari". No. No, thanks. Here... - Peppi'! - Let's toast to a "scopa"... Don't cheer, turn the card and think of playing. Afterwards, right? Scopa! Stay with me, Anto', then we're going to crush them... Who are the two guests? Only two poor people who live in a hut next to mine. And the lady - how did she meet them? Eight years ago, when she came to to Rome for the first time, she asked me: "Pasquali' do you know two people who can play cards well?" I called them and introduced them to her. Will they come every night? No, from time to time... When the lady gets bored. Does she always give them one million? Yes, she always gives it to them! Think about it a bit more! Anto'... there are 200,000 lire! Ssshh! You see... Three points in a single move! Scopa! I'm kidding... - Count it! What to count? Three scopas, four in the pack, all together 7 points! - What's the score? - Them 14 and us 18! I am sorry madam; this year is going to be tough for you. George... Deal! Hey, boys, do we want to go to work! Wake up! - Watch the suitcase! - What are you talking about? I dreamt that papa and mama had won a suitcase. Inside there were 300 million. Let's go to work! You come too. - Why do we work, tomorrow we'll have lots of money. Tonight I'm not going to do anything. Boys, let's do the job for Uncle Osvaldo, at least tomorrow we'll have I am tired... Who told you that? - The radio. - The radio says lots of bullshit! Let me get it. How can this old woman spend 20 million per day? How? I tell you how! - Say it! - 3,000 lire per day for meat, just to be on the safe side and 10,000 lire per day for car and driver! But that's 18,000. I want to stay even safer, I'm going to allow the old lady 1 million a day for eating, drinking and sleeping. for the villa and for the driver. But what about the other Are you asking me? Professor, what do you think about all this money? I think you are getting lost in petty problems, to spend 20 million a day... what's so difficult! I can even spend 40, if I wanted to... if I could. The real problem is about politics, understood? That involves the theory of positive value. But such problems have been analyzed ad nauseam, by the philosophers of historical materialism. Only in order to understand such matters, you know what you have to do? Read! How long I have been telling you to read, read... I'm going to have a pee, sorry. I answer! Hello. Pasquali', I'm the Professor, tell me all. Ah! Thanks. News? Very good! Peppino and Antonia have already won 50,000 lire and they bet 200 more! Peppino laughs, maybe he's getting lucky. He always laughs! and 3... 7! What's wrong? Yes. Why? Peppino, when you're playing, you can't talk. Scopa! - That's one more gift we give them. - No, maybe not. No? Get this! Scopa. Anto', don't rebuke me, I get confused. We won. Eh? How much? This is 100 we had won... and another 100 we lost. Here madam that's 100... Hello... At once. New York, madam. Hello, Tony. Let me talk and don't say stupid things. - Is it possible that you always make mistakes? - Yes, I know, I made a mistake, but it's not only my fault, but also yours! The more you stare at me, the more tense I get. - Read to me what's written. - Yes madam. What do I do? - Read! And what do I read? Here it's all zeros. No, there is also a 2. - No, further down, further down. Where? - No, that's London, further. This one... Here, it's 5 million dollars. That's 3 billion lire! - Plus 200,000 you gave her before. Yes, in Germany something is happening. Ciao, "piccolo stronzo"! George... Please, let's not waste any time. She says "piccolo stronzo", she learnt... Madam what's happening in Germany, any danger of war? No, it's just a question of dollars. How much do we want to bet this time? - Do we want to bet 300 billion? - Are you crazy? - Sorry, but with all these figures... I meant 300,000 lire. - Let's do... 500,000? Yes! Anto', do we want to bet it all? I feel I can win! Let's hope she can feel it too, but of losing, madam. This is going to be a very interesting card game... No more roses, now. Come on, hand it! Peppi', that card is worth - So what? - Antonia, no advice. No worries, with this card I need no advice. Anto'... Take this, enjoy! One million... plus 50,000... One million and 50,000. - Minus 200,000. - Minus 200,000, Plus 500,000... Here it is, 1 million 350,000... it's correct. - And if we play double? - Then it's 2 million 700. I threw it down on purpose because I was dealing. You had two cards in your hands only, you couldn't miss it! Then you did it on purpose! - What were you thinking about? - It's the oldie who tricked me. - But if I leave the 4 on the table, you cannot throw down the 3, so they get the "settebello"! I thought you had it, the settebello, how could I guess the oldie had it? But when I look at you and twist my mouth, what does it mean? What does it mean? That you have a nervous twitch! No! It means the settebello is over there! Who cares where it was, I didn't have the cards! You had the cards, you haven't got the memory! So what?! 1 million and 350,000 lire, it's nothing. We have a whole month to play, we can take away from her... What can we take away from her?! And you go to sleep, it's late! Tomorrow there is a funeral, the dead don't wait. It's past midnight! We are working here, we are not playing! Hey, what's with these insults? These long faces? Children there's no point in criticizing, we live illegally in a hut, full of rats, when it rains, we are carried away by firemen on a boat, your papa has an injury from war and cannot work more than this, otherwise, he would be a great worker. Look at this, he is asleep on his feet. He can't work this late at night. Our only hope is to be able to win some money from the oldie. For 8 years she's been giving you a million a night which she wins back. Children... come over here. Come here, children, gather around papa. You must have a lot of trust in your parents! Papa and mama do everything for you, for many years we haven't been lucky, but sooner or later it will change, we will grab from this oldie We'll buy a large flat and we'll send you to university. I'll strike it big... Take over Maroccan's warehouse, barn included, the garage and his big pile of rags. Do you like Maroccan's factory? The factory yes, but not the Maroccan! We'll get rid of him. Cleopa', have a smile, because if everything goes well, papa is going to take you to Switzerland and let you have surgery on your leg by a famous doctor. Are you happy? - Yes. With that one around, there is nothing to do! It's what I've been telling you for 8 years. Don't deceive yourself, because the oldie is unbeatable, like death. Nobody has ever beaten her and nobody will be able to beat her! I know who can beat the oldie, but no one is brave enough to pronounce that name. Say it, the name... You need Richetto... Richetto the cardsharp! Can you move the car from here in front? - You placed your hand on my shoulder? - So what? Listen, did you have a good look at this face? - Who is it? No need to know who I am, you cannot place your hand on the shoulder of someone with a face like this one. I heard that you played and you lost, as always. I'm not talking with you, you understand? Antonia, don't treat me so... You know I have many women and they still run around me. But only one has stayed in my heart and that woman is you! You start again; I am married! What a big mistake you have made, marrying that boneless fellow. If you married me, you would be revered like a signora now! You never know, I might be able to strike it lucky?! What luck... You've been playing for 8 years and you have not won a lira. It means we can't play! No, no. You are good, I've known you since you were a kid playing with your granddad, you were unbeatable. But that idiot of your husband is not up to the task! Hey, aren't you going to leave? Anyhow, I'm always ready to couple up with you. What? On the card table, I meant. If you and I go to the oldie, we'll empty her safe! And see her weeping! Cleopa', do you want to marry me? Money tempts you, right? Go and play a game! - 150 lire, lady. - Write it down, I'll pay you at the end of the month. I wish someone would be mistaken and pay cash for once. Cleopa', what would you like? A kilogram of pasta, 2 kilograms of bread, 300 grams of "mortadella". And a box of poison. - A box of poison? - Yes, to kill the rats. Ah, to kill the rats! Why do they always send you shopping? Because mama is ashamed buying on credit. But here there is almost a half million debt. Papa said that, when he wins, he'll pay you the bill and he'll lend you a million too, so you can buy a real shop, all right? Give me the poison! Did they play last night? No, the lady hasn't called them again, we all have been waiting for a week. Peppino made the mistake! If the oldie leaves a 2 on the table, what do you do, put down a 5? Hey, why don't you stop it? You've been banging on about this for 2 weeks. - Good evening, father. - 'Evening. You know what? If I win 7 million, I ain't gonna take them. Don't always talk about the same stuff, don't have dreams, you will get upset. Hey, they don't play even today? No, the oldie is having a party tonight too, all foreigners, ambassadors, generals. Here, you see? It's 9:15. Blast... Papa, there's no point staring at the clock; she is not going to call you. What has happened? Maybe we annoyed her?! If she is offended? It cannot be, when she waved us good-bye, she said: "See you, I'll call you at the trattoria." Yes, she said it! Come in! Here she is! Good evening. Look who he is, the Professor. I brought you the pan back, your soup was delicious. - I made it tonight too, would you like some? - Thanks. Look at what I found in a stall. Where is it? Three years I've been looking for it for you! - Professor, can you move? - Certainly. Here! Lts a very rare book. - Take a seat, Professor. - The scopone scientifico! - Let me see. This book explains all the rules and secrets of the game... Who wrote it? Count Valentino Maestrelli, a great theorist from the 1800's. Delicious! Yes, good isn't it? Very well done. Now I'll read some passages to you... You listen too, children. Let's remember that studying... is the base of it all. The so called scopone scientifico... Turn the TV down a bit. - No, papa what are you doing? - Quiet, let's listen to the Professor. Playing cards, as everyone knows, are 40 in number, but combinations, once shuffled, are infinite. It means that out of 150,000 billion games, you'll never be served the same hand of cards. Hey, hard to believe... Things that make your head spin! So each game has to be played like a unique case, on the basis of an ever changing situation. - Quiet will you?! - What is it? Is the phone ringing? No, it's a bicycle. Peppino, are you following this? No! Professor, you read books to me... You fill my head up with big words, but if the oldie doesn't call any more, what's the point of your teachings. Also tonight we are still waiting... - Damned... She! You shut up! I know... The rich, the powerful... cannot comprehend the hardships, the anxiety of the poor... Homer himself, who you study at your shitty school, said that, whilst men struggle, fight, live their tragedies, the Gods behave like beings frivolous, cruel, whimsical. - We are fond of the oldie, we even love her. - No! This is an unforgivable weakness. How can you win the war, if during the battle you get fond of the enemy! Indeed we are losing! Then you must stop being fond of the oldie! And start hating her... hating her! The shortest route to take everything away from her would be to physically... eliminate her, but because now for many years we have accepted the game, we must fight her scientifically and with no pity! You are right, Professor, that dirty old bag! We have been suffering for too many years, but if she calls me... I'll put her down and break her spine! Quiet will you?! It's her! It's ringing! - Good evening... - Go, go she's waiting for you. - What do we do? - Come, I'll show you! - Don't exaggerate! - Yeah, yeah. - Where is she? - Please. Over here. Oh... My dear friends... I am so happy to see you. - Good evening, madam. - 'Evening. How come you aren't giving me the usual kiss tonight? Give her a little kiss, go. Is something wrong? Has someone been trying to poison our friendship? Well, spiteful gossip abounds, somebody says one thing, somebody another. - One never knows who to follow! - Right. Nobody forces you to come here to me. No, we come because we are so fond of you, madam. - Show her the picture. - What? Yes! Look at what I brought you, the picture of when we got married... - It is beautiful... - Nice, eh? - Peppino... push, please. - Yes! Ready! I'm going to show you the photos of all the people we've been playing, here I will place your photo. Anto', she's going to put us in her album. Are these bedouins? - Yes. When George and I go to Damascus, we always play with them. - These guys are poorer than us. - Can they play cards? No, they are not that good and are not very lucky either. Pedrito and lmmacolata, they are Chileans. These are our Indian friends, from Calcutta, and these... these are... two diabolical Philippino players. Have they managed to win some games? they took from me! How much is it? That's 18 million, Anto'. - 18 million? And these are two Brazilians, very good. They look like little monkeys... Hello, George. - Here is your million, Peppino. - Thanks, and they say she is bad, she has given us another million. - Thanks, too generous. - Go, Anto'... - 6. - 8. Good Antonia, come on! Do we want to start with 100,000 a game? we've got one million. Let's do 200,000! Giova'... a little drop for me, no ice. Don't get distracted, the settebello is on the table. No... I know what I am doing. With 7 of spades I grab the settebello, one point is assured. - Peppino... - Sorry, madam. Madam, excuse me... There is a 7 on the table. George, don't give me advice. If she let the 7 onto the table, she understood that I haven't got it! - Any news? - We are all waiting, Cleopatra just went to call. Here she is! - What you say? - Then? - They lost half a million. - It's not that bad. Cleopatra. Come over here. - Go to hell! - Hi Cleopa'. - Hi Paride. Thanks for the postcard you sent me from jail. I received an amnesty, I got out early. Is it true that in her safe the old lady has almost 100 million? Even more! Things would go better, if I had a better partner. Why are you saying that, my lady? Of course... It's always my fault, isn't it? Take this, look what I do... - God, he leaves the king on the table. Scopa. I felt she had a king. - First you feel it, then you make a mistake... - It's midnight, sorry. I ought to listen to the news, there is something interesting. How is it going? Madam and Antonia are playing great, as real players, but men are weak. Especially Peppino, he's not up to the task. I've been saying that to Antonia for years, Leave that turd alone and pair up with Richetto, then you'd be a millionaire by now. The President of the Republic, has welcomed at Quirinale, the European foreign ministers... What are you doing? One of the Community tasks will be to strengthen the existing ties between our countries... Today, a speaker for the German government, has announced that tomorrow the German Reserve Bank, will stop buying US dollars. With this measure in a few words it means that the government no longer accepts sustaining the dollar's path. With this measure, Bonn intends to put a stop to the speculator's actions around the world. Where are these speculators? If I could lay my hands on one of them, I would shoot him in the head. Don't say that out loud. Madam, with this news, has earned 2 million dollars. - Turn it off, George. - Yes, madam. She earned 1, 2 billion! - My compliments, madam. - Well, dear friends... Shall we resume our game. - How can she be so lucky? It's not at all a matter of luck, my dear, high finance is like playing cards, she who knows the opponent's cards wins. But if I can't see them, how do I know about my opponent's cards... I did not understand, Peppino. No, it is something Antonia understands. I throw the horseman! Antonia, you are terrible, how did you know I didn't have a horseman? Memory! Memory is a matter of youth. Sorry! It slipped, I didn't remember she is old. - Ignorant! Peppino is like this. Damn it, she talks of youth and leaves me the horseman on the table. Why? Who has it? He has it! Now it is all scopas. - No. - Scopa. Scopa. Scopa. Who cares, just 4 scopas. - We won. - One moment, don't rush, it could be that we won instead, let me count. Why do you count, pay. Yes? Here it is madam, tonight too she has cleaned us out, we have no more money, we're going. What a pity, so early tonight. Good night. - Shall we come tomorrow, madam? - Tomorrow evening I'm busy. - Then we'll come the day after that? - I'll call you, good night. - Good night. - Good night, George. Listen Anto'... If we try with our own 10,000? - 10,000, who has it? Excuse me? Yes, Peppino. As we are not tired yet, we would like to bet 10,000 from our own pocket, but because we don't have the money, if we lose... we'll bring it tomorrow, all right? I trust you blindly, it is going to be an exciting game. - Sorry, where is my sister? - Hi Peppi'. There she is. - Iola'! - Peppi'! If mum could see what you are reduced too. You've got all your ass in the air... Peppi', tonight I dreamt you had won 300 million, you were coming here with the police, to have Gigetto arrested and to give me a bar in Via Veneto. You dreamt wrong; we lost 30,000 of our own... Give me some. I can give you only 2,000 lire. If it's all you can... Iola'... If I think back to mum... On her deathbed she said to me: "Look after your sister, give her a hand, she would like to sing on TV". Let those stupid things alone and take me away from the street, this job is not for me really. You dirty... what are you doing, taking money from your sister? You dirty... you ask her to be your fiance then put her to work on the street. - Watch out - they're armed. - Yeah? Should I be afraid of him? Well, how much money do you want to give her back to me? You know the amount. You bring the cash, put her on the truck and take her back home. Iola', rest assured! Trust me, I'll come one day and pay the ransom and open an ice cream place for you, with tables on the path. Thanks for the thought. Peppi'... - Walk, go to work! I can give you 3, 800 lire. - Excuse me, isn't Richetto here? - He's over there, in the private room. cards, denari, settebello, 4 scopas, all for us. Excuse me. He was lucky because I did not have a 6. Yeah, yeah. You bet your wedding ring too. How do you know? You're hiding your hand. Yesterday we lost 30,000 lire. How much do you need? Is 20,000 enough? - If only... - Riche'! Right now I haven't got it, but... give me an hour, I'll play three games and bring it to you. This is not a place for a lady, go back, wait for me at the bar. Did you scrape together 30,000? We are scraping, how much can you give us? I let your son work here, ask him. Be proud of your father, he was an honest guy, he hasn't even left any money for the funeral! He had the chance to enjoy his son becoming a carabiniere. - Cesari'. - Who is it? What do you mean, who is it? It's me, papa! What's up? Only 500 lire they gave you? Papa, they called me to save money, otherwise they'd call the barber. Here you are, served. Don't you ever lose? Antonia, Richetto only loses when he wants to. Then you win when you like?! I win enough, to live an honest life. I'm satisfied with 300, 400,000 lire a month. I don't miss on anything, I have a flat in the centre, I have even taken my mum out of the home. - How do you do it? It is a question of psychology, one day I win 10,000, one day I lose 5, one ought to give a sop to these good people. The day after I take 40 off them and change area. Listen, when you get the wrong cards, what do you do? Cards love me, because I am a professional. I live a steady life, like a sports champion, I sleep 10 hours per night, one hour of gym in the morning, well, I show up at the game fresh and restful. Others are tired, they drink, smoke and lose before even starting. Also Peppino doesn't drink or smoke, but when we are there, he loses his head! Antonia, we have to get rid of your husband! What do you mean? Tonight you're going to give him a cup of wine with cloves, give him 2 aspirins and put him in bed with the flu. And then? Then you and I... go up there, to the old lady... and take her for 300 million! Then we run away! - Run away. With five children where do I run? We'll bring them along too. Yeah, yeah... You've gone crazy. Thank you! Ciao. Think about it, Antonia. - Why are you running around? - They killed the oldie! Someone robbed the villa! Paride! My son! He wanted to die! He swallowed a razor blade! You can't take him to jail! They went to rob the villa, but they ran away before starting. Give him back to me! He is clean! Stay back! Back! - You can't take him to jail! - Grab him by his legs. Is she dead? No, the scare has given her a mild heart attack, but she is getting better now. Oh God, thank you. Then we play, tonight! - That I don't know. - Peppino, Antonia, come up here. - What do we do? - Let's go, they're calling us! Come. Come. Good evening, madam. Who are you? Eh? It's us, madam. It's Peppino and Antonia. You don't recognize us... Oh, yes. You are my dear friends. Madam, I wonder how scared you got... No, I understood they were amateur thiefs, a badly organized robbery. - They're poor people, no education. - They're ignorant. I am particularly sorry for that young fellow, he seemed nice, as soon as he saw me, he ran away. My dear... We'll play a game, immediately. - But we are all dirty... - Who cares, wait for me downstairs. Come on! - Let's go? We'll wait downstairs! Madam, you had a serious attack, you can't play tonight. Who forbids me that? I am your doctor and it's my duty to forbid you. Nobody has ever dared to boss me around, not even when I was a kid! - Did you bring the money? - Yes. However, there is 1,000 lire missing. Then, if you don't mind, I am going to lend it to you. We thank you immensely. So you side with us? You are against the oldie? I wholeheartedly wish you will win a large sum, so, perhaps you take me into your service. What? I am old, madam, and I need a last job. Furthermore, I love kids. - Shall we take him on as a waiter? - Yeah... We need a waiter now. Here I am, are you ready? Anto'? Where did you put it? Go and get the roll! Hold on a second. We have brought you the money, madam. That's 30,000 lire we lost. No, no... I do not want this money. Buy a present for your children! Thanks madam, thanks, you are really good. - Yes! For us you are really like the Old Witch! What? Was I wrong? - George, go and get some money. - Yes, madam. Madam, have you looked properly everywhere? Are you sure that they have not robbed anything? - No, nothing. Also it doesn't matter, it's all insured inside here, for double its value. - Yeah? Then it was better if they had robbed. - The usual 10 million? - Certainly. Hello? Straight away. Professor, telephone! Someone wants me? Coming. Hello, who is it? Tell me, Pasqualina. After many years of disappointment, tonight something very important has happened, it has been demonstrated that the old lady is not at all unbeatable. What does it mean? It means that from now on all surprises, even the most imaginary, are possible! Speak out! They won 5 million and, if they win this game, it's 7! - They made it! - Drinks for all! - Who pays? - Peppino! We can drink for 7 million! - Why are you screaming? - Don't shout! Otherwise taxes will take everything away from him. Do you want to bet that they really won? Let's go to the villa. Scopa! Scopa! Scopa! Scopa! Take it Anto' - count. - Why should I count? denari... It's all for us, cards too. - Have we won? Yes. Collect, come on. Yes. I am sorry madam, but it's another 2 million. Tonight you are very lucky, I am really glad. Thanks. I pile it here, I don't even count it. Anto'... look, it's 7 million. - Let me touch them. That's not bad; feel the weight. It's like a kilogram of potatoes! Antonia? I feel like eating some spaghetti the way you make it. - Yes, madam. - Then we'll play some more. I'll make them at once, a plate of penne with garlic, oil and chilli, as you like it. - Peppino, help her. - One moment. Peppi', come here, give me a hand. Where? In the kitchen? I am going?! Anto'... Anto', are we leaving all the money here? Don't you trust them? No, it's just it's 7 million... So what; to her it's nothing. To her, but to me it's a mountain! Shut up! Shut up, she is looking at us. Peppi', I can't believe those What did I tell you, Anto'? Trust me. Now the flat is coming. No? Add some anchovies, I like it a lot. Shall I add a chilli as well? Yes dear, yes. Hell! I'm furious, you hear? I'm furious! You... You cannot imagine how much I hate her. When she loses, she becomes the most wicked woman in the world, because since she was a little girl, she is used to winning and a defeat makes her furious. But she will have to come to terms with losing, she has 20 million income per day... You don't know her. The thought of losing 1,000 lire makes her crazy with hunger. Then if we win 200 million, what's she going to do? I have been employed by her for 37 years and she has never given me a salary. Why didn't you resign? It's a long story. You would need the hand of a big novelist to tell it. Were you lovers? Please excuse me for this outburst. She was young and beautiful, when we met in Miami, I made her a portrait. I was a painter with a great future. For her I... gave up my art and I've spent all my life loving her. And now here I am. I have become her chauffeur, her servant, it is true; I hate her! But... I can't live without her. When I hear a love story, I always feel like crying. So? Thanks. Thanks a lot. - George, it's nothing, keep up. - Thanks. Friends... in the name of this... immense love, that I've been holding in my heart for 40 years, I ask you... a small... favour... - Tell us, tell us, George. Let her win. Will I bollocks... We've played for 8 years to take some money away from her, she has always won, for once we win! I am sorry but I can't! Peppino is right. Madam has had an attack, she lost consciousness. - It's better to put her to bed at once. - Yes. - Poor madam. - George, what do we do, do we leave? - Go, go, OK. - Let's go... There she is... Good night and thank you. Let's go! Take it. God, how nice they are. - Count them up. - 2, 4, 6... 7! - Put them in the bag. - I haven't got it! I brought you this one, it could be useful. - Put them here, down! - Slowly so they don't get ruined. This is for you. - Thank you, don't forget about me. - No. Who could forget you! - Could I, mister? - No problem, ciao. - Let's go? - Yes, yes, coming. What's this revolution? Peppino and Antonia have won 7 billion! - Yes, 7 billion... - Priest, that's 70 million. Let me through, let me see this money. - Let Don Roberto through. - Yes, so he can do the multiplication... - Drink, drink... - Whatever one may say... money has always its own mysterious charm. What do you know... money is always money. - Calm down... gently. - She is feeling sick! Let her touch the money, so that she recovers. Yeah, let her touch it, come on. Enough now - you make it dirty, they don't take it at the bank any more. Money is also the ruin of the world! No, priest, he who has it can enjoy it! Calm, calm! Winning 7 million, one thinks it looks like a mountain, it's a heap instead. - Money from the old lady... - Hey, now this is mine! Boys, are you happy that we have won all this money? - For me, it's too little. - For me too. You dirty ones, you foul ones, what more do you want? In a single night we gained an apartment. Because I can't play, otherwise... ...We could have won 200 million! The game is not over yet, it'll continue tomorrow night. No, tonight... I was unbeatable, the more I played, the more I won, I had it all in my hands! If the oldie had kept it up, I could have taken half a billion! - Peppi'! - I say half a billion! What? - They want you on the phone! - I'm not available for anybody. It's the oldie! - Peppi' run! Don't let her wait. - What does she want? - The oldie has been resuscitated! - Put them in the bank! Yes, I know it. Guard, stay close to me and keep the gun at hand, I have got money. - Anto'... Let's go! - Let me do it! Guys, no jokes please, I'm armed and can shoot! Don't breathe down on him. God, maybe she died... Yes, hello? Hello? Quiet please! Hello? Yes, it's me, Peppino, tell me Pasquali'. Let me talk to her. Good evening madam, sorry, tell me. Here, it's confusing. The oldie is feeling better and wants to keep playing. What do you want to do, Peppi'? I don't know. What should I do? She got offended, she thinks we run away and, if we don't go back to play, tomorrow she's going to catch a plane and never come back. But this is the big chance you were waiting for! I know, I was waiting for it but... hey, the money! They robbed me of the money! - It's here! Hey, don't make any tricks, I could die! Professor... We've got 7 million here, what should we do? I'll tell you! Grab me a chair. Listen Peppino... In front of such a spontaneous people's gathering, I want to ask you an important question. Yes Professor, help us as we are ignorant, right? That's right. 8 years ago, when you began this long game, you perhaps established a fighting plan, an objective to aim for... Answer! What? I, no! Aaah... You accepted to play this long game, undertook this tremendous fight that had us all involved, in dramatic anguish, for years, and now you tell me that you did not know what your final objective was?! Sorry but... what objective? What is an objective? It's a "quantum"! Calm down... he's going to explain it. The quantum is the quantity of money, that is of power, we want to pull off from the old lady! I say, do we want to be content with so little?! I don't know... The objective is 100 million, or do we want to take all from her... and share the money among us? - All? - All father, all! It would not be the first time it's happened, the old prince Pignatelli, for example, in his castle at Zagarolo, in a single night, bet all his fabulous estate away. In the end he bet his wife away too, of whom he was madly in love. At sunrise he uncorked a bottle of champagne and shot himself in the head. - No, it's better you accept it, with the money you won you'll buy a little flat and pay off your debts. - Yeah and then we'll be worse off than before! What are we gonna do? I say, do we want to be content with so little money, and give up on the old lady for ever, who's worth 2000 billion? Resign ourselves to this miserable and dark life... without the hope of seeing some light... Friends... to fight is to live! Resignation is like dying! Don Robe'... No offence, Professor. I did not understand what you just said. What should we do? Before the oldie takes all the money back, you'd better run! I can hide you, in the presbytery. Of course... he's right, let's run to the presbytery, for me 7 million is already too much. What do you say Anto'? Anto'? What you doing, crying? What are we doing here? I would need a brave man. - You need Righetto! Who mentioned that name? Dirty cowards! You've been whispering for years. Can't you see I am changing colour? My blood stops as I hear that name! Who said it? Is this a conspiracy? Come here! Do you want a proof of my courage? - Yes! Yes? All right... I am ready! Let's go playing! Let's go! Where are they going? - To bet on the flat. Peppi', remember you are invincible! Snatch her half billion! - Even a whole billion! - Let's go up to the villa! Carme', your uncle Garibaldi is coming, he ran away from the rest house. Gariba' have you gone crazy? What you do here? Go back to the rest house. No, I ain't going back, because the nuns make us sing and do gym. Don't complain, you've even got heating. Who cares... Peppino has been promising me a hut for 8 years. Hit her! - Peppino... I am pregnant! - She has 12 children... Do you like the hut? - I like it a lot... Then let's unload... Don't you feel well, madam? No, no... I am really fine! George... But one million to start with, aren't you giving it to us? - I don't know. - What are you saying, Peppino? No, I meant... One million to start with, aren't you giving it to us? There is no need, you have your own money, right? Aaah. I had a try... I felt she wouldn't agree... - You felt it, eh? How much do we want to bet per game? What? Let's do 10,000 lire, just to... - Let's do 2 million, OK? - 2 million? - Yes! Listen, it's 4 o'clock in the morning and we are all tired, My proposal is to bet all the and we can all go to bed, all right? - I am on! - No, no, no. I am not! - Pull out the money! - Noo. - Pull out all the money! - All? Yes, all! - As you like, right? - Yes! Here! but it is absurd. I say so too, George. Can one bet 7 million? Come on, please. Let's bet 3... 2... Make her happy, Peppino. Hey! There is no way, she won't give up, she wants to take the flat away. Well! - What's the score? - 7 points madam and 15 Peppino. Another 6 points and they bring back Scopa. Peppi', don't be a bastard! Scopa. - Scopa. - Scopa. - 5 and 3, 8. Scopa. Settebello is coming here, for Peppino all is clear! It's 4 scopas, Anto'. - 15 and 6, 21. We won. We won... Are you upset? George, give them the money. It happens, don't pull a face, a game is a game. Peppino... you don't want to leave, do you? It's the end. You said it was the last game. He is right, that's what we agreed on. There is no need to remind me! Peppino... don't you want to play another game? I don't, madam. Let's go Anto'! Where are you going? - She is sick, she can't manage. - And you want to go home? - Anto', it's 14 million. - That's not that much! Let's keep playing, madam. - Good on you, I'm really glad. George, go and fetch 14 million! I am really glad for you, Peppino. Antonia claims that it's not much... Madam, you are in no condition to play... and as your doctor, I order you to stop, immediately. I have already told you once, nobody has ever dared to give me orders, not even as a little girl. I beg you madam, give it up, I'm asking you... You very well know that I never give up, come on, bring the money! Here! At least take these drops. How boring. Little bastard! Lolanda, telephone! Hello, who's speaking? Ah, tell me. Iola', aren't you feeling well? No, where is the phone? Hey, give me a cognac, lolanda is feeling sick. Are you pregnant? No, my brother... Did he have an accident? - No, he won 28 million! Wake up, come on, wake up! Wake up and look at the money. - What happened? I fainted, Anto'. - If we double up, it's 56! Let's run. This oldie wants to see the end of us. Madam, your blood pressure is too high, I advise you to go to bed at once. And I already told you that I want to play another game. - Here, it is booming! - It's your head. - Yeah. - I always tell you, leave your head at rest. Do you remember last year you wanted to resume studying? - There was an explosion! - Yes. Madam, we have been playing... for almost 24 hours, if you keep playing double up, you will lose a fortune. - The property is mine! If I want to, I can bet it all. Anto', I look at you but I see you upside down, I see double. Peppi' don't behave like this, I'm going to kick you in the ass! - Calm down, don't reprimand me. - What kind of a man are you? Go and get some more money! Go! - Wake up, it's the right time for us! - What do we do? - Remember what I told you. - Yes. We start again? The chair... Here. What's the stake for this game? If he wins, how much will Peppino bring back home? - 56 million, madam. - I am glad. - How much? - 800, miss. - Keep the change. Don Robe', it's me, how is the game going? I don't know, they rang us up, let's see. - Aunty! Aunty! - Who is it? Ah it's you, dear. Hi Cleopatra. - Is it for me? - No, for the Professor. I'll talk, it's the same. Pasqualina? It's Don Roberto, tell me. Damn them! They won 56 million and they are playing double up. They are mad! I have finished being a whore! Hey, aunty is kissing the priest! It's 112 million, if they win the next game, it's 224! What are we going to do with all this money? We'll put put it in a bank and live like rich people. Here. Madam, what are you doing? What... what have I done? You have taken a 7 with a 5? You cannot play like this, perhaps you are a bit tired? Shouldn't you have a rest? Thanks Antonia, in reality I feel slightly stunned, I can't even see the cards. Madam... at this stage you should give up! In your conditions it is not a dishonour to give up, listen to me. She is right; don't be ashamed, you must say if you feel sick. We are ready to stop, aren't we? That's what I'm saying too. Let's stop, let's go. You see, madam, I am very good at this game! You are a bit stoned, if we keep playing, it's like... stealing her money. I see... You are all against me! No, you shouldn't say that, it's not true. Indeed it is so. All my life I've had enemies around me. I have always been alone. Why do you say you are alone, madam? Antonia and I are here. We are not going to abandon you. - It's true, you ought to believe it. We are very fond of you. Thanks. Then, if you really... are fond of me, let's keep playing. Then? The game keeps going. They are betting 224 million, If they win, it's half a billion, precisely. - No, it's 448 million. - You look at 50 million change. If they win another game, it becomes one billion. - Amazing! - Halt! I would stop here. What do you do with a billion, if I was the tax officer, I'd take 700 million from you. - Who would you take it from? - From you. I'd put them all in a suitcase and carry them to Switzerland. What, do you think I have a clock around my neck? Doubling up, as foreseen, is dragging the old lady into a vortex, a scary spiral, so much so that Peppino and Antonia, by the eleventh game, will have won 19 billion. If the oldie says: "Would you double up those 19 billion? ", what is Peppino doing? - He is shitting himself! It's all envy. Why? If you were Peppino, what would you do? Wouldn't you try? Remember, that the doubling up game is a trap. Why? Because the old lady owns assets worth 2000 billion, and she can afford playing endlessly, whilst if Peppino makes a mistake he is gone! What are you doing, sleeping? No. It's the sun, it's warming me up. Waiter? - Yes? Can you shield the sun? It's on my head. Draw the curtain. - Of course. Hey "sun"... we are betting Yes, I know, I know. - Oh! - What? Yeah, yeah, scopa. Yes, I tell them. What happened? Papa with the 7 of spades, has taken the "settebello", mama made a scopa and the lady dropped onto the floor with her eyes crooked, her heart wasn't beating any more. - And now? Thank goodness, at last! Is she dead? No, but the doctor said her life is hanging by a thread. - Cesari'! - What? - Where are you going? - To uncle Osvaldo's, thinking of the oldie's funeral! Of course it's a long procedure: Customs, a special international coffin, but we are ready. The carpenter has just arrived. It's going to be a big ceremony with ambassadors, bankers, politicians. It is a deal of quite a few million, there's money to be earned for everyone. Listen, the corpse has to be moved to California, by a specially rented aeroplane. An escort is needed? Easy, I can go! I cannot lose out on a trip to California all expenses paid, can I? About time! You took your time to arrive, father! - Am I still on time? - Yes, if you move! Otherwise, she leaves! Poor madam... What are Peppino and Antonia going to do with the money? They are still waiting for the old lady to make up her mind. What do you want? I have to measure up the corpse for the coffin. You damned fool, she isn't dead yet, I am not going to let you in! Is she in agony? Peppino... is she Catholic? She's a foreigner! Yes father, she is Catholic, of strict observance. Hey, is it possible that you are always around? Do you want to take our own customers? - No point in going up the stairs. - Why not? Who are you? Who knows you? Cesari', serious organization is needed here, we are in touch with doctors, with priests, with domestic staff... No need! This time there is no other way, the funeral is ours, we are the waiter's friends. Doctor? There is a slight sign of recovery. Madam, would you like to repent your sins? Would you like to confess? Would you like to confess? I want to play cards! What did she say? She said... she wants to play cards... It's your business now! Damn her! Here goes another one... Take it George. Let me go! My uncle has been around for 8 years to make her funeral, now you want to snatch it away from us?! Now that she is dying! Peppi', we are 20 all... I know... Good gracious... She gulped down You've got only one card to throw. Is this the one you wanted? We are ruined! - Anto', be kind. - I don't want to see you any more! - I accept I made a mistake! - Go away, I am not coming back home! I wanna die! I wanna die... Anto'! Come here! I wanna die too, with you. - Go away, go and die somewhere else! You had two cards, you threw the wrong one! Antonia! Dear! Don't despair, the oldie is leaving the day after tomorrow, we still have tomorrow to play. I wonder... maybe it's going to be the right time! We'll take it all! Anto'? - Go away! You go home! - We can go on a trip, a cruise. - Go away! - Come here! Anto', it's not that bad! - Don't follow me! - Give me some trust... - I am not playing with you any more! Anto', think. It's not only my fault, there must be a mysterious force working against us. We've got the evil eye! We had the apartment, the warehouse, the millions... If I think about it, I'll stab myself! A stab... Hey? Where are you going? Do you drive by yourself, hey? Jump in, are you afraid? Come here! Where are you going? Bloody hell! Are you against me too? Oh God! - Peppi'! What happened to you? - I broke my head! - Are you hurt? - What a hit... - Are you... - Stay here, don't get scared, I am not hurt. Is it possible that everything goes wrong with you? You forget to apply the hand brake too. - A coincidence, we are even... it is OK, we are lucky! I could get killed, you'd be a widow. What a big mistake I made not marrying Richetto. What did you say? What did you say? What a mistake I made not marrying Richetto. Professor, 5000- sign me in! I sign nothing, if you don't bring the dough! - Farullo Domenico, 3000. - Farullo Domenico, 3000! No, here we have to lift the bets, a chance like this won't happen again! - Pull out the cash! Pasquali', sign me in for a 1000 lire. - Calm down, queue up! - 8000! Don Roberto is sending 20,000 lire. Now the father is more confident, isn't he? Don Roberto... - 20,000! - 20,000... As far as I am concerned, I bet 15... - Well... Let's do 12, OK! Professor Armando Castellini... Let me through. Let me through. I can't stay standing up. Let her through, she's pregnant. Well, 10, you are a family! First name and family name. - Carboni Liliana. - Mr. And Mrs. Carboni, 8 plus 2! Here he is... Here is Richetto! I gathered one million and 130,000 lire. - Do you trust me? - Blindly. We put together all our savings, then we will divide the winnings democratically. We have been waiting for this moment for years. Let me kiss this holy hand that never misses. You should know what this moment means for me. Please, dear. Richetto, bet all on the first game, got it? Then keep doubling up. Be ruthless, don't give her respite! You understand? We must destroy her! Destroy her! - Take it, I brought you an aspirin. - Have they left? Go away, what aspirin?! Everybody knows I am not sick! She's a coward... A stab... - Drink anyway, it's good for you. Go... hold on, Cleopa'. Do you realize, do you realize what your mother did? After so many years... of happiness... What a humiliation... Such a humiliation for a man like me. When I think that your mother is up there with him and they may even win... those two... Hey? Cleopa', are you listening? Yes, I am. Then answer to your papa. I would like, you see Cleopa'... the old lady to give a lesson to both of them. Your mother went up there with him, because she thinks she can win with him. And I hope they lose! They can't really lose, that's a professional card player. No, that's a dirty one. Who told you that? Everybody knows it. What do they know? Who said it? What are you talking about? He said that they'll first win just so as not to scare the oldie away, then they'll lose 5 to give her some pride back, then in the end they'll empty her safe. Listen to this, what a plot they've been planning?! I wonder how long they've been plotting this betrayal in the darkness. I can't use a thermometer, I am feeling fine! What am I doing in bed? What are you cooking Cleopa'? Fettuccine? I am making a pie for the old lady. She is leaving tomorrow. You are too good, Cleopa'. We are going to give the oldie some pudding too. That's right. Where are you going, papa? Going for a little walk. I cannot stay here, inside this house, without your mother. Pasquali'! - Who is it? Pasquali', It's me Peppino. How is it going? Wonderful. Yeah, right? Every card Richetto puts down, Antonia can reply... and the old lady grows pale. That pair is unbeatable. Yeah? It's 12 hours they have been playing double up. They are going to empty her safe. Yeah? Hey, can I tell you something? Yes. Do you love Antonia? Yes. Then let her go; it's better that you stay away. - Yes? - I have something to do. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hello? Straight away, yes. Professor, telephone. Coming. Hello, Pasqualina - tell me. Yes, we've all been waiting. Pardon my insane gesture. Help! Save me! Hurry up with the boat, hurry up you'll lose him! Help! Someone drowning. Oh! Who is it? - It's him! - Who? - Richetto the cardsharp. Richetto? Oh God! And Antonia? Has she jumped in too? How do I know, he's full of water, call the fire brigade. What fire brigade? You need a doctor here. Who can do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation? Riche', wake up, wake up. Move over! Is he still alive? You dirty coward, where is Antonia? What happened, why did you jump? I lost half a billion! The old lady has taken my car, my watch, my ring! I lost everyone's money. - I have ruined my reputation! - And Antonia? To get back she lost 300,000 from her pocket. Hers? Who gave her 300,000 lire? Antonia! Oh God! Why this ambulance? They have stabbed the Professor. You wanted to play it all against me, didn't you? If someone didn't stab him, I was going to do it. The Professor has ruined us! What a mess! Hey, has anyone seen Antonia? Help me, Peppino! It's your punishment for playing all the money! Take it, I go back to walking the streets! - Son, calm down! - Move off, father. Mam, no point to defend him, he bet 30,000 lire. What are you all thinking about? Amilcare, if you don't help me, I am ruined. - No Antonia, let me go. - Wait! I cannot trust you, I must talk to Peppino. No, Peppino must know nothing. Antonia! Oh God! Dirty coward! Let me catch you - I'm going to kill you! Give me a gun, I want to become a widower! I want to end up in the newspapers! Help! Let me go, let me go, you dirty swines! You are all plotting against me! What do you want? You are a priest, I kiss your hand, but you mind your own business! Oh, he's gonna strangle her! Yes, I want to strangle you. You heartless mother! You better take her away from me. Can you see what I am reduced to because of this wicked woman? I have been suffering for years! You have been harassing me for years! It was enough, wasn't it? You ought to have the satisfaction of playing with Richetto, oughtn't you? Are you convinced now that he's more of a bastard than me? Have you understood now that I am the best? Who is the best? I am the best! You are Peppi' and I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon... - Ah, you beg my pardon? Then do you admit in front of everybody that you made a mistake? Yes, yes, I made a mistake. And I love you so much. Me too, I love you very much. - Don't cry. - Who cares about riches, as long as there is love. Peppi', don't cry, let's think about the most important thing: Today madam is leaving. - Madam is leaving? - Yes. Aren't we going to say good-bye? Yes, but if we don't bring her the 300,000 that I lost, next year she won't play with us. What can we do, my love? Who on earth has 300,000 lire? - He! - He who? Amilcare. Amilcare the Shark? - Yes. Listen, Shark. I've brought 300,000 lire, but what security are you giving me? The hut, what else? What are you talking about, are we selling our hut? Peppi', listen to me, let's go to the airport, show her the money, as she never takes it, we do right and return home. You are right; it's a good idea. If the old lady takes the money, what are you going to give me? What are you talking about? We know madam well. She has never wanted our money. That's why we'll take it to her! Come here, I'll sign a mortgage on the house. Hurry up! Come on, let's go! There she is, madam. Can you see her? Papa, the one in the wheelchair? Quiet, don't be rude. Madam? George? We are here. - Good morning. Oh, Peppino. My dear friends. Can I introduce my children? How delighted I am! What nice children! I almost gave up on you. No madam, we are poor but honest. Give her the money, Peppi'. - Yes. See, we are here to do our duty. Thank you. George, what are you doing? No, I don't want this money. No madam, don't do this, we'll take offence. So we are going to bet with this money. How, I haven't got any cards. Dear, I never travel without a pack of cards in my purse. She has got cards... Thanks. The highest card wins! Yes. That's it! Madam, it is tough for you, I've got a queen. The hut is safe. A queen. - I have a king! - A king? - I won. - Good-bye hut. Good-bye... I am sorry. Thanks. - To you, madam. What is right, is right. I am convinced that next year you will be luckier. Good-bye! Bye, kids. Madam? Here are some flowers I brought for you. You are kind. And this is a pie I made with my own two hands. You will be eating it during your trip. Thank you. You have beautiful eyes... but strange. Good morning, madam. Can I have your tickets? Cleopa', how much poison have you used, in the pie you gave the old lady? A whole can. Let's hope she can't smell it, when she eats it. If rats can't smell it, not even the lady can!
