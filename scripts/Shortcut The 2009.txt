I'm stationed in Germany. Isn't it gonna be dangerous? Yeah, well, we gotta stop the Nazis. - I'll write to you while you're there. - Thanks. By the way, thanks for walking me home. Are you kidding? You're my favorite girl. (both chuckle) Hey, c'mon. Let's cut through the woods. It's so dark. Come on, it's just a shortcut. I've always been a little scared of the woods. Really? Well, don't worry. I'll protect you. Oh, you're so sweet. - Oh gosh. - (both chuckle) - Fantastic. - I'm tired. My feet hurt so much. - That's from all the dancing. - We didn't stop the whole time. Well, we tried, yes, but we couldn't stand back and watch - Danny and Jess, right? - Yeah, we did, but then we came out - and gave them a little bit of a-- - We gave 'em a show. We gave 'em a show. Yes. Yes we did. - What is it? - It's-- you look beautiful. - Stop it. - Come on. I'm not ready for that. Oh, I think you are. Let's just keep walking. Come on, Irene. What are you running away for? I ship out in 2 weeks. Irene, wait. Okay, that's enough. Stop it. I like that. I mean it. - Too hard. - (grunts) (cries out) Dougie, no. - No. - Shut up. Shut up. (grunts) You bitch! (grunts) (girl crying) I should kill you, bitch. Thank God you're here. Please help me. Go tell someone to get the police. Hurry, please. Can you hear me? Are you deaf? What's wrong with you?! (shrieks) Why? So who do you like in the fight this weekend? - Is there UFC this weekend? - No. - MMA? - Dude, it's the heavy weight championship - of the world. - You follow boxing? I follow everything in case you haven't noticed. - Hey, Howard. - I don't even know who the champ is. Awesome. Well, if you ever want to make a bet, then just let me know. I'll help you out. Why, do you know a bookie or something? - Yeah, my dad. - Come on. I swear I haven't known you that long. You could be a narc for all I know. Didn't want to get busted by the new kid. Wait. You're serious? (sighs) Hey, Brad, you had the Celtics last night, didn't you? Hey, can I-- can I get that to you on Friday? No. Thursday? Fine, but don't bring me a bag of change this time. - Thanks, Lisa. - No shit. - Told you. - I hate Paul Pierce. Do your parents do anything else besides break people's legs? Yeah, my mom's an elementary school teacher so it kind of balances stuff out. What about you? Well, my dad's not around. My mom is working on her real estate license. Cool. So where do you guys live then? - With my grandma. - Nice. Yeah, it's great. Woo-hoo. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Yeah, we got like Looks like I'm getting laid 3 times. - You're such a virgin, Mark. - Idiot. So what up? Yo, where's your crew shirt, man? It's a practice day. Yeah, I kinda-- kinda quit. What? When? You moved here - You bastard. - What can I say? It sucked. Damn, man. Now I'm all alone again. Everyone else on the team is an arrogant prick. I know. That's one of the many reasons that I left. Well, cherish your freedom, you dick. I'd probably walk too if it weren't for my dad, - but what are you gonna do? - (chuckles) - You working tonight? - Yup. - Cool. Me too. See you guys later. - Bye. - Later. - I don't blame you for quitting. You know, I just never understood the excitement of rowing a boat. Exactly. See you. Ow. - Hi. Here to see Mr. Armstrong. - Sign here. Man on P.A.: Attention, students. There will be a mandatory fire safety meeting this afternoon in the auditorium. Armstrong: So soccer. Soccer's going well? Yeah. We're doing better. We have a big game on Tuesday. I'm sure you guys are gonna be fine. - Girl: Hope so. Plan on it. - That's good. Any thoughts about school yet? I'm thinking about Columbia. I really want to be in a big city. Columbia's great, - but it's also ivy league. - I know. Why? You think I can't get in? No. No. I just, uh-- I want you to pick a few safety schools, you know, as insurance. It's just not an easy one to get into. So we'll just keep thinking about that. - We still have some time. - Okay. - All right. - Thank you, Mr. Armstrong. No problem, Christy. Make it a great day. - I always do. - Good. - Hi. - Hello. Mr. Lucas, you can come in now. So how are you? Pretty good. I was talking to your mother today. She said she's still worried about your transition. - I'm fine. - You sure? I heard the crew team didn't go very well. According to Coach Klein, you told him that crew was "stupid, boring and meant for kids that suck at any other sport." Does that sound about right? Yeah, that actually sounds about right. Well, you're entitled to your own opinion, but quitters are usually frowned upon by colleges, Derek. Even Columbia? Even Columbia. (school bell rings) I had the sickest triple-kill last night-- took out 3 noobs with a Spartan Laser. Man, I'm so bored of Halo. I like the new Metal Gear Solid. The graphics look so real. Hey, Tobey, do you have a 360? Yeah, but I can't play it. Grounded. - That sucks. - Hey, are you guys in Scouts? - You signed up for that? - So lame. Shut up. My mom's making me. So why are you grounded? I got in trouble at my old school. What happened? Some kid stole my bike, so I beat him up. So you think you're tough? Tougher than you. Okay. Then why don't you take the shortcut? Oh yeah. What shortcut? We'll show you. Okay. Boy #1: So do you know karate or something? Tobey: No. I just use baseball bats. - Boy #2: Yeah, right. - Tobey: It's true. Boy #1: One thing though: You can't let anyone see you cross the fence. - Tobey: Why? - It's an automatic detention. This is it. Does anybody ever use it? Boy #2: Sure. Boy #1: Most kids are too chicken though. It's just a stupid path through the woods. Have you guys taken it before? - Y-yeah. - Sure. Where does it go? Right to your neighborhood. Boy #2: Way faster than walking around. Boy #1: Just go for it. See you later. See you later, tough guy. Boy #1: Hey. Didn't Brian Whitley's sister die out there? Boy #2: I'll bet you the crazy old man got her. Do you like blood, boy? Do you?! Huh?! Do you like blood, boy?! Huh, boy?! Huh?! - Do ya? - (whimpering) Next time it's your blood! Man: It is not at all uncommon for a boy his age to get into a little trouble from time to time. I did my fair share of hell-raising. Normally, I would agree with you Mr. Hartley, but there have been several reports from his teachers and other children about his violent outbursts. And after this last incident in which he struck a young boy in the face, he was brought to my office where he expressed some disturbing thoughts. Isn't everyone overreacting? He's just an 8-year-old boy. Thank you, Mrs. Hartley. So what would you have us do? Unfortunately, what you do about his condition is no longer my concern. My attention is focused on the well-being of my schools. You've got a lot of nerve saying that to me. Sir, while your family's history in the area is greatly is appreciated, I must tell you that Benjamin is no longer welcome in our classrooms. Excuse me? I'm sorry, but he can't stay. Are you out of your mind? You expect him to have no education? He's a smart boy. He'll behave. Sir, you're lucky enough to be able to afford some kind of treatment that could help. He doesn't need any treatment! He's a Hartley. There are many fine institutions-- Institution?! You son-of-a-bitch! That damn school was built on my family's land! You're trying to tell me that one of my boys can't go there?! Administrator: I think I should be going. Hartley: Damn right you should be going. Get the hell out of my house! Administrator: Mr. Hartley, please consider the well-being of your family. - Hartley: Get out! - Sir, I truly believe your son is deranged. Hartley: You'd better stay the hell off my land! Mrs. Hartley: Frank, what are we gonna do? Mr. Hartley: I don't know. (dog barks) - (loud thud) - (dog yelps) Hey, what's up with Christy Doyle? Christy Doyle? (snorts) - Why? - She flirted with me - in the guidance center today. - Oh, she flirted with you, huh? Then why are you asking me questions, mister? Well, you've known her a lot longer than I have. Like what's she all about? Fill me in. (sniffs) Derek, it's not like we hang out. I don't know anything about the girl. Take it easy. Just help me out. - Is she dating anybody? - (sighs) Matt Fink; fullback. They've been dating for, like, 2 years. Really? She's not a cheerleader, is she? - No, she's a soccer player. - Nice. So what's wrong with their relationship? There's gotta be something. I don't want to talk about Christy Doyle. Come on, Lisa. 2 years? You know it's getting stale. I don't know, man. Sorry. - I gotta go to work. - Okay. Thanks for the advice. Call you later. Bye. - Tobey! - I took the shortcut! - What shortcut? - The dog, he killed it! Tobey, what are you talking about? Did you do something? - No, I didn't do anything. - Tell me what happened. These kids just showed me this path and there was this dog all cut up and I fell in the blood. It wasn't me. It was the old man. He said if I went back, I was next. - What old man?! - I don't know who he is. You know you can tell me the truth, right? I am. Don't tell Mom, okay? It really wasn't me this time, I swear. Did anybody else see you? All right, come on. I'll find out who this old man is. Where's this shortcut anyway? (cell phone rings) (beeps) - Yo. - Mark: We're freakin' slammed here, man. (reception crackling) Where are you? We're-- - Hello? - Come on, man. We're slam-- I've got really crappy reception here. We're short-staffed. You aren't here, I'm gonna beat off in your apron. (stammers) I'll be there in like 5 minutes. All right. (beeps) - Girl: Hey, Derek. - Hey, Julie. Hey, you're here. Good. - Yeah, sorry I'm late. - No, it's great. It's great. Man, Coach is so pissed off at you. He told everyone what you said, which was actually quite amusing. Really. So awesome to be hated by people. Number 89. Are you okay, bro? I'm in the kitchen talking to Lisa on the phone, Tobey comes in with blood all over him. What? What happened? Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine. It was dog's blood. Dog's blood? Yeah, he found one all hacked up in the woods. Some old man was in there. He thinks that maybe he did it. Bastard scared Tobey half to death. He took the shortcut. Yeah, how'd you know? Come on. Everyone knows about the crazy old man on the shortcut. Bro, I've been here 2 months. Thank you. Yeah, the story goes back a long time. The old guy's a freakin' psycho. Everyone always said he was connected to some missing people or murders or something, but nothing's ever happened to him. You know all that land near Hartley Elementary? - Yeah. - It's his. Shit. Kids used to take the shortcut all the time back in the day. Then he showed up and started chasin' 'em around with shovels or some shit. I can't believe your brother actually took it. That takes some balls, man. I went to that school. - I never once went down there. - Huh. - That's 'cause you're a pussy. - That's true. Dick. Number 90. Now watch it. Always away from you. - Okay. - (door opens) - Dear. - (sighs) - Hey, Grandma. - How was work? Not bad. Kind of slow. Brought you some ice cream though. Butterscotch. My favorite. Thank you, honey. - How's the car coming, Tob'? - Fine. He's been working at it all afternoon. Really? I thought Scouts was lame. I like this part. Well, easy, man. Knife looks sharp. Enjoy. (sighs) Hey, Mom. Hi. Wait. - So I got a call today. - Wow, that's awesome. It was from your school, smartass. You wanna tell me why you quit the crew team? Yeah. It was a waste of time and I just didn't want to do it anymore. It's not like you to quit. It's kind of disappointing actually. It's not a big deal, Mom. I went to like 3 or 4 practices. What exactly are you gonna be doing then? - I have school and work. - It's your senior year, Derek. You know, it's just crew. I'm not the one that you need to be worried about. You should be setting an example, especially now that your father's not around. You mean "dead," Mom. (bag rustling) - Hey, Tob'. - Can I have a ride to school? Sure. Hey, come here. Come here. How you doin'? You still okay? - Yeah. - Well, don't let your friends talk you into doing anything stupid today. - Okay. - All right. I'll pick you up after too. Did you eat your breakfast, sweetie? Yeah, Mom. Good morning. Look, I know how important your senior year is 'cause I've been there. Sorry it had to be this way, but we're doing the best we can. - I love you, you know? - I know. It just sucks. Van Gogh was a complete loon-- crazier than me, if you can believe it. Some say he was born that way; others believe he was driven to madness. Man, you are super perv today. Give it up, man. She's Fink's girl. He'll kill you. Teacher: Oh dear. I could go on and on. I got to go for it. Unlucky in love, nobody appreciated or recognized his work during his day. He may have only sold one painting. Yet today he's revered... Hey, do you think I could get one of those? I'm Derek. From Mr. Armstrong's office. Oh yeah. The new guy, right? Now let me just zoom in here and get you some more details. - (clicking) - This darn thing's not working again. Not good with technology. So you ever played Truth or Dare? Yeah, I have. Give me one. Okay. Truth. Did you really come over here for a Twizzler? (inhales sharply) No, I did not. I think you just earned one for honesty. All right. Amazing. Truly amazing! So I hear you might go to Columbia, huh? I'm thinking about it, yeah. That's awesome. Me too. I've decided to dedicate my life to art history. - Oh really? - Really. I'm gonna be Miss Milan's personal assistant. - She's my new idol. - Mine too. The lines, the color, the depth, - it's very vaginal. - (students snicker) Class dismissed. (lockers opening, closing) Hey. You Derek? - Yeah. - I'm Taylor. - What's up? - What's this shit your little crew buddy Mark's been talking about? What do you mean? He's telling people that your brother found a dead dog on the shortcut. You know, over by Hartley Elementary? - Is that true? - He did. Why? My dog's been missing for, like, 3 days. Oh, man, I'm sorry. Did he tell you what kind it was? No. All right. That's all I need to know. Yo, Taylor. - Um, are you gonna check it out? - Yeah. Let me know when you're going. There's some guy in there that really freaked out my brother. The old man, huh? Sure, whatever. What's your cell? Mom, that was really good. I can't have another bite. - I'm done. - Thank you. - Mom? - Here you go. Thank you. - Is there any coffee left? - In a minute. So, Grandma, do you know anything about a guy that lives in the woods behind Tobey's school? Why do you ask? Just heard some kids talking about it. You guys haven't been going in those woods, have you? - No. - Stay away from there, you understand? Mom, please don't scare them. That old man's been around since I was a kid. Don't go there ever. Okay, Grandma, we won't. Mom, what is she talking about? Tobey, why don't you go help Grandma and then get ready for bed? (sighs) Fine. Night, sweetie. A long time ago before I was born, some kids went missing from the old high school, kids your grandma knew. Talk was they were last seen taking the shortcut. Police investigated for months. They came up empty. Nobody was ever arrested. Nobody knows what happened to this day. But everyone looked at the Hartleys different after that. - As in "Hartley Elementary"? - Mm-hmm. That family's been around for generations. The old man's the last surviving member. I just think he's a crazy recluse, but he's not a murderer. He just wants to be left alone. So do what your grandma says and stay away from him. - All right. - (doorbell rings) I'll get that. - You expecting someone? - Yup, it's for me. You ready? I don't blame your brother for being freaked. That old bastard scared the hell out of me when I was a kid too. - But not anymore though, right? - Nah, I ain't scared of him. So what's the plan? Well, head down the shortcut, see what we see. Then we take a look around the old bastard's place. Okay, let's go. All right. (video game gunfire, shouting) Hey. Didn't I tell you to get to bed? - Tobey. - (gunfire ceases) You're not even supposed to be playing those. - I'm almost done. - When I come back, - you'd better be upstairs. - (gunfire resumes) Derek: You're friends with Matt Fink, right? Taylor: Yeah, he's all right. Isn't he dating Christy Doyle? - Yeah, why? - I-- uh, no reason. - I got a class with her. - Shh. This is it. Come on. Okay, wait. Go. Go. - Is that Hartley? - Yeah, that's him, all right. What do you want to do? - Let's go. - All right. All right. - (footsteps) - He's coming. Yeah. (can clatters) What the hell was that? Hey, come here. (metal clatters) - What's your dog's name? - Uh, "Tammy." "Charlie." Derek, I swear to God if he did anything to her, I'll kill him. (door closes) Hmm. If someone's in here, you're trespassing. What's he doing? - Oh shit, man. Run! - Go! - Hey! - Derek: Run! Hartley: Keep runnin' or I'll slaughter you like dogs! Go! Derek: I'm telling you he was definitely trying to kill us. - Damn. - What is with this guy? I don't know. - Yo. - What's up? Ah, lovely Lisa. Is tomorrow cool? Yeah, that's fine. Hey, I heard you guys had a close call last night. So those dog tags I found, they were pretty old, but one of 'em still had a phone number that worked. - Beardsley? - Yeah. Went missing a few years ago. - Never found him. - Maybe the old man's - pulling a Michael Vick. - Shut up, Mark. No, seriously. He's probably making 'em dogfight. Don't make me tell you this twice. Stop talking. Okay. I think we should go out there again. I know he's killing dogs and we've got to prove it. Yeah. When? I got practice now, but I'll give you a call. - That boy is aggressive. - Yeah. He's just trying to find out what happened to his dog. No, he's just an asshole. All right. I got practice too. - Keep me updated? - See you. Can you guys take care of that? Thank you. What do you say we do a little investigation of our own? Oh, so now you want in on the action too? What can I say? I'm bored. Derek: So that's his front entrance. Yeah. I mean, it's the only place that makes sense. - Sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Why don't you just let Christy read the map then? (snorts, chuckles) There he is. Finally we can get in there, scope it out. Oh damn. He's stopping. Who is sending him mail? - Oh my God, he is so creepy. - Yeah. So much for the investigation. - He's backing up to his house. - Well, there's 10 minutes of my life I'll never get back. (laughs) - Are you-- you're number 25? - Yeah, thank you. Keep it scoopy. All right, man. I'm listening. Okay, now let's say this whole Christy thing actually works out. There could definitely be some runoff benefits if you convince her to bring some of her hot friends. - You could totally hook that up. - What are you talking about? Come on, man. If you're gonna fool around with Christy Doyle, I want to bang her friends. Okay, which one do you like? - Wendy Rowe. - Mm. Yes. Man, it's her freckles. I just want to grab her face and... you know? Need to get her in on Operation Old Man. I'll see what I can do. Hi, uh... can I help you? I'll take a dog. A dog. Yeah. With mustard, onions. Right, of course. Um, anything else? No. That'll be $1.50, please. Yeah, just $1.50. (change rattles) Uh, I'll have that right up for you. Does he recognize you? I don't know. I can't tell. Just give me the hotdog. Go. Here you go. Keep it scoopy. My God, that is not a handsome man. Christy: Uh, hello? Hey, Christy. What are you doing here? Uh, trying to get french fries. Of course. Do you know that guy? That's the old man from the shortcut. - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. That's him? We think he killed Taylor's dog. - Tammy?! - Yeah. You wanna help us spy on him? Spy? Why don't you just call the police? That's no fun. Besides we're not 100% sure that he did it. Hmm? All right. Take my number and just, um-- just text me later. On the house, Madame Doyle. Thanks, guys. I will text you later. (sighs) Christy Doyle. (object clatters) Shit. Hello? Oh, come on. Who's there? (shovel scrapes loudly) (shovel scrapes) (chain link fence clatters) Hello? Hello? This isn't funny. Who's there? - Derek, help! - Mark? Tell him you're sorry, Derek! Hey! What are you doing?! - Get away from him! - Tell him you're sorry, Derek! I'm sorry! No, don't! - (shovel thuds) - (Mark grunts) - Mark! - (groans) Mark! Mark! (both laugh) Now who's the pussy? You sound just like a little bitch, Derek. You guys are assholes. That was not funny. You should've seen your face, man. "Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!" "I'm sorry. Let him go!" Well, you scared the shit out of me. Seriously, though, thanks for trying to save me anyway. Very heroic of you. - I am a heroic guy. - You've got to admit we got you good. Yeah, you did. Don't want to hurt you Try not to mess with your feelings It's just a matter of trust for us, for us Don't wanna hurt you Try not to mess with your feelings It's just a matter of trust for us, for us For us You should come over 'Cause I can tell from your eyes Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind? Too much confusion, she needs a little more time So many times now we've been through this before. (whistle blows) Lisa: So I tried to carry the thing on my bike, you know, on the bike rack thing-- it was like 60 lbs. The box was, like, enormous. It was huge. That's what she said. I appreciate it. Another dog owner. They never found theirs either. (whispers) Like I said: Michael Vick. - (giggles) - (chuckles) - What was that? - Nothing. So, uh, what's the plan? My uncle said that old man, he spends every Friday night at the VFW. Wait. He's a veteran? Right. So in case you were wondering, he does have guns. That's perfect. I will pick Christy up and we'll check out the VFW. You guys go to the house. - You're gonna pick up Christy? - Yeah, she wants in on Operation Old Man. [ Skipped item nr. 658 ] - You're not gonna be there tonight? - Hey, what's up, Tob'? Crap. I totally forgot. - We're working on something. - Yeah? What? Look, I'll make it up to you. I promise. - I'm sorry. - My little brother Brian's racing a car too. He's gonna be pretty tough to beat. Aren't you a little bit short to be driving a car, man? You're gonna look like Toad in Mario Kart. - Mario! - (mimics Luigi) Im a gonna win. Okay, guys, just leave him alone. Gotta go. Good luck tonight, man. Kick Brian's ass. You gonna cry? Come on, don't be so sensitive, buddy. (chuckles) (footsteps) Benjamin, what did you do? Man: Hey, Ricky! - Where are you? - Grab him. Get him to the barn. Hurry. Man: Hey, Ricky! Ricky! Where are you? Hey! What's going on?! (gunshot) You promised this wouldn't happen again. Again? Don't just stand there. Let's clean 'em up. - Watch out! - God, you're such an idiot, Mark. - Got you a little bit. - Not really. (both chuckle) How far do we have to go in there anyway? It's only a few minutes. You've never been here before? No. I went to St. Katherine's. We don't get peer pressure there. I'm just not a big fan of being chased with a shovel. ...fat guy that dances during their shows in the background. Really? (giggles) It sounds stupid, but it's really funny. - That's funny. - Well, it's not. Hey, look what I got. What's that? Nice! Nice. Where'd you get those? - Donna G's brother Ingo. - Oh, okay. - Wow. - Whoo! - Impressive. - Here. - Your turn. - Thank you, thank you. - Huh. - Cheers. There he is. (phone vibrates) - Yo. - Mark, he's here. I'll let you know if there's any movement. Cool. - We're all clear. - Let's go. - All right. - Hey! - Woo! - Stop. - Let's go. - (Mark chuckles) So how long do you think we'll be here? This isn't exactly as exciting as you made it out to be. Come on. The night is young. You know, you're gonna have to do a lot more than just take me to a movie to make up for this one. Oh really? What do you have in mind? I don't know. Be creative. Mark: Hey, Lisa, is it weird that these woods are making me horny? Lisa: Yes, Mark, it is weird. Move your ass. Let's go. Come on. There is no way Tammy is still alive. Yeah. (huffs) This is where the tags used to be. - (whispers) Roid rage. - (chuckles) Yeah. I hate to say it, but this place is just as freaky as I thought it'd be. - You hate to say it? - Shut up. To hell with it. Let's go check out the house. Lisa: Can you guys believe this shit? Hey, guys. - Nine Inch Nails? - Not so much. How about Marilyn Manson? - No? - Not really, no. - Really? - No. What about Shwayze? I met her at a backyard block party by the bar She kept looking at me like she knew who I was She was buzzin' all over me She was buzzin' all over me She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love. (laughs) I like that song. - Yeah? - Yeah. You wanna see 'em live? I'll get tickets for us next time they come to town. That would be awesome. I'll hold you to that. Matt and I broke up today. What happened? We were just done. I'm sorry. Why? You know what? I'm really glad you came. You are, huh? Yeah. (Lisa groans) Get your hand off my ass. Sorry. Okay. - Did you get it? - Give me a second, okay? Hey, are we sure we want to go inside? Don't be such a douche. We came here to look around, right? That's what we're doing. We're looking around. Okay, yeah, but now this is like breaking in. - That's different. - It's not breaking in. It's sneaking in. What do you see? - (grunts) - Whoa. - You all right? - Lisa: Yeah. Way to go, Lisa. Real sneaky. - (pounding on door) - (gasps) Jesus. Taylor: Hey, come on, let us in! Okay, I'm coming. Hey, come on. Come on. This place just keeps getting better. This place is a dump. Yeah. Welcome to the bachelor pad. Taylor: Let's split up. You guys go that way. (door creaks) - Okay, you first. - You go first. You're the guy. - (sighs) Same time? - Go. All right. (Lisa gasps) Hello? Lady? Ma'am? (both gasp) - (nervous laughter) - You killed her. Yeah. Lisa: Oh, okay. Here. Oh my God. What do you think they need a classroom for? Home-schooled, I guess? Recording: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, - one nation under God, indivisible... - You've got to be kidding me. ...with liberty and justice for all. (recording skipping) ...for all. ...for all. ...for all. Whoa. Oh. Whoa. Oh my God. - (roars) - God! - (laughs) - I hate you. Jeez. - Just kiss him. - Get away from me. - Just a little. - Stop. Seriously. - (laughs) Jeez. Hey, man, look at that. No, I'm done. Come on, man. Don't be such a baby. Are you serious? What? Was this your plan the entire time? (chuckles) That's him, right? Yeah. (dials) Oh shit. It went straight to voicemail. (dialing) Who are you calling now, your girlfriend Lisa? Oh, come on. You know she likes you. - (voicemail recording) - I can't get a hold of her. - We've got to beat him back. - Awesome. - Did you find anything? - No. And I don't even know what I'm looking for.

Elephant shell You're my cave and I've been hiding out Will you tell me a little bit about A bit about yourself? I threw darts at a spinning globe Swapping out passport photos I walk west to the setting sun Every single step, I grow Another second young Hold still! Hold still! Hold still! Hold still, don't fade, hold still! Don't fade I don't know who else to ask Sitting in the dark Filling an empty glass Stained my teeth with more red wine I'm a romantic But never pearly white Hold still! Hold still! Hold still! Hold still, don't fade, hold still! Don't fade! All my hair grows in Wrinkles leave my skin Hold still, don't fade I'll be back again when the tide is in some day Hold still, don't fade I'll be back again when the tide is in some day Hold still, don't fade I'll be back again when the tide is in some day Hold still, don't fade I'll be back again when the tide is in some day Elephant shell You're my cave and I've been hiding out Will you tell me a little bit about A bit about yourself?
