Flying high, above the clouds, swimming deep, under the sea and roaming on it's beautiful lands. They can be found everywhere you care to look. Here we find a young man, named Ash Ketchum, who hails from Pallet Town, working with his partner Pikachu, to catch other Pokmon and refine his Pokmon battling skills. As he travels with his friends, there have been twist and turns on the road during Ash's journey as a Pokmon Trainer. Indeed, his road has branched off in many directions. Lost at times, occasionaly retracing his steps, or forcing him to take the long way, but through it all continuing his journey just the same in order to find truths, hidden within us all. It's useless. No matter how often you ask. The People of the Vale have a place. A place where we're meant to live. But Damon, that's just a legend, so why don't you leave. I won't. I want to see Glacine, the village chief. Look, mom, we found it! Please, keep your voice down. -Sorry, mom. The Beartic haven't heard us. You did a great job finding it. They'll be thrilled to have this. Lillipup, great! Glacine, over here! Stay close! Damon? Who's that Pokmon? -Could it be? It's the legendary Pokmon... ...Zekrom. Please, Glacine. Listen to what I have to tell you, just one more time. The People of the Vale must now reclaim there bond with the land. Beyond hope, you will find your ideals. POKMON BLACK VICTINI AND RESHIRAM It's a Mandibuzz! Cilan, do you see it? Not yet, Iris, but I think we should see it fearly soon. That's it! It must be! As Ash continues through the Unova region, on his quest to become a Pokmon Master, our heroes have arrived at the mountain town of Eindoak, just in time for the Harvest Festival. Don't worry! I'll help you out there! Here I come. Hang on. Ash, I'm coming too! -Iris, wait, don't do it! The ground won't hold. -Ok. Ash! Ash, no! He just jumped! Did you see, what I saw? We're ok, guys! We all landed in one piece! And how are you planning on getting out of there? Hey, there's breeze comin' through! We'll follow it out! Follow me. Hey! Anybody hear me? Anyone? Hello! What was that? Again. Hey! Iris, Cilan! Come on, get up here! You gotta check out this view! Quick! What are you standing there for? And to think, we were worried. What a kid. Deerling! Try hanging out in safer places, ok? This castle is called The Sword of the Vale. Sword of the Vale? Look, over there. They say it flew through the air from that valley and landed right here, on this spot. Flew through the air? But how can a castle fly? It's a legend. It's impossible to know, if it's really the truth. But look, you can see with your very own eyes, that the barries in the surrounding orchard are beautiful and delicious. Awesome! They look yummi! Gimme! Somebody hungry? In case you haven't noticed, I'm always hungry and that's that! Why do I even ask? -Ash, I got just the thing. My homemade macaroons. -Thanks Cilan. Yeah! Way to go! I'm gonna eat 'em right now! -Good idea. These macaroons rule. Best I ever ate. Ash, what's wrong? -It's gone. The macaroon disappeared. Knowing you, you probably ate it. Hey, Ash. Don't cry. -Fooled ya. Check it out. Still got one. What a kid. The Festival's beginning! Let's see. Quick! If we don't hurry, we won't be able to register for the competition! I can take you. Here. If you're in a rush, this way's much faster. That's so nice. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ash. I'm working to become a Pokmon Master. And this is my partner Pikachu. My name's Iris. This is Axew. I'm training to be a Dragon Master. I'm Cilan. A Pokmon Connoisseur. My name is Damon. I've been working on restoring this castle. Please, follow me. It's a Golurk. -It's huge. Wonder, what it's pulling? Let's find out. Look, there so cute. There Victini dolls. The Victory Pokmon. Victini? -Right, Victini. They say, it's lived in this town since long ago. I wanna meet it. -Very few have every seen Victini. It's said to give people and Pokmon power. Power? That's right. Long ago it was said, to have protected the Sword of the Vale. Really? Awesome! I'll take one of these, please. -Here you go. And one day may you receive Victini's power as well. Now I know, I'm gonna win the battle competition. I'm well aware, that our plan was to catch Pikachu and all of the other Pokmon in the Festival, but now... -That story is a real game changer. Victini, the Victory Pokmon. -A Pokmon that can give you power. Simple. All we do, is catch it! Ladies and gentleman, moms and dads, girls and boys and of course, Pokmon, I welcome you all to the Eindoak Harvest Festival. My name is Mannes, mayor of Eindoak Town. Folks, I'm happy to report our orchard have given us a bountiful harvest this year. So, Festival fans, are we having fun? Yeah! All right! Then it's time to kick off what you've all been patiently waiting for. Our annual battle competition! Here are simple competition rules. Trainers, who have gathered here and wish to participate, will have a one on one Pokmon battle with no substitutions. Whoever holds the competition necklace until the end, wins! Carlita, good luck, dear. -Thanks, mom. Piece a cake. All right! Let the battle begine! Just watch me win! -Watch me win. We're gonna win, right, buddy? Scraggy, let's go! Scraggy, I want you to watch all the other Pokmon, when they battle. Then, let's go! It's always hard when the journey begins. Hard to find your way, hard to make amends. But there's nothing you cant' do, 'cause you've got the power inside of you. It's never easy, to make a choice. To keep things inside, or raise your voice. For everyone, there comes a time, when the light inside begins to shine. It's not always right or wrong, As long as your spirit's strong. It's not always win or lose, it's the road you choose. The answer's within! It's not always black and white, But your heart always knows what's right. Well, let the journey begin! So many choices, how do we know? So many places, where do we go? What should I say? What should I do? Still, we're together, me and you. It's not always right or wrong, As long as your spirit's strong. It's not always win or lose, it's the road you choose. The answer's within! It's not always black and white, But your heart always knows what's right. Well, let the journey begin! POKEMON! There's nothing you can't do, 'cause you've got the power inside of you! It's not always right or wrong, As long as your spirit's strong. It's not always win or lose, It's the road you choose. The answers within! It's not always black and white, But your heart always knows what's right. Well, let the journey begin! POKEMON! Good luck to both of you! Tepig, I choose you! So, Tepig, a fire type, is up against Samurott, a water type. I'm afraid that this battle is gonna leave a bitter aftertaste in Ash's mouth. Tepig, don't worry. We'll show 'em how strong we are. Ok, Tepig use Ember! Not very effective. All right, use Tackle! Samurott, Razor Shell, let's go! Tepig, you ok? You're fired up to win. Ok, Tepig, Ember, once more! Ember, again! -What for? Samurott's unable to battle. Tepig wins. All right! Tepig, way to go! An unexpected flameburn. Simply delicious. That last Ember was incedible. Hey, mother... That Tepig powered up quite suddenly, right? Yes, it did. -So, do you think, that could've been the work of Victini? Come on, now. I never turn down a chance to battle. Let's do it! So, Scraggy's your choice? You bet. Ok, Scraggy, let's go! Wait, Scraggy? This battle might not go down as easily, as the battle with Tepig. -All right, Scraggy, now... Ok, Scraggy! Use Head Butt, once more! Hydreigon is unable to battle! Scraggy wins! We did it! We did it! Have a good rest. Here. -Thank you. That was the work of Victini, right? -Victini? What are you talking about? -I saw it. The way your Scraggy was getting power from Victini. Do you mean this? It didn't do anything. Really! -I'm talking about the real Victini. The real one's here? -So, where is it? Come on, I wanna see Victini. But Victini's invisible now. It can do that. Invisible? Victini must have been the one, who ate my macaroon. I wonder what we heard back in the cave? That sound could have been Victini's voice. Hey, Victini? Did you give me power earlier? Hey, Victini, that you? If it is, come out and say hi. I've still got some macaroons! Way to go, Cilan. Bet this'll work. Victini, I got more macaroons! It really does exist! To think, Victini appeared for a macaroon. So, was it good? Hi, my name's Ash. This is my buddy Pikachu. And my name's Iris. -Hi, I'm Cilan. Hi, they call me Carlita. Victini, is it true, Tepig and Scraggy suddenly got stronger, because you gave them some of your power? You're incredible! Thanks so much! Victini, what's wrong? -Poor thing. You've made Victini cry. -You were playing a little too rough. I'm sorry, Victini. Really. It's so amazing Victini showed up. A true wonder. It's like an exotic and rare ingredient. It makes me feel really, really happy! She's not the only one, who's really happy. It's a once in a lifetime shot. -A powerful Victory Pokmon. Now, if Victini were ours,... -Imagine all that power in us! Feelin' good! Victini, let's check it out! Come on! Victini, what's wrong? Victini, what happened? Victini, wait! Victini... You really met Victini? -Yes, mom, we really did. Perhaps, Victini didn't like the Barrier. Barrier? -Our village has an invisible Barrier around it and it is said, that Victini can't go beyond the Pillars of Protection. Go beyond the Pillars of Protection? They form a Barrier. -That must have been, what that was back there. -Yeah. Hey, everyone! So, we meet again. -It's Damon. My brother! -What? Your brother? -What do you know. It's been too long, mother. -For your information, six months, to be exact. -What brings you back here? I'm just helpin out with the restoration of the castle. Upon my special request. -Look, Mannes! Your position as mayor, does not allow you, to boss my son around. -Whatever you say, my dear Juanita. Damon, Victini actually exists. Yes, I know. The scent of growing grass. Lots of fresh air. This area is as sweet as ripe fruit. -Yes. Victini! We didn't know, you couldn't pass the Barrier! Please, come on out! -You don't have to hide from us! We got delicious macaroons! -Yeah, come out and have some! There telling us, to follow them. Victini! Victini, you're here, right? I'm so sorry I frightened you before! I'm really sorry! Victini, you don't have to hide! Come on out! It's Victini! You're back! I told you! Ash! It's cold. Gotcha! Victini's having fun. My plan is to borrow some of Victini's power. You see, both Juanita and I, are descendants of the tribe called the People of the Vale. People of the Vale? It's the tribe mentioned in the castle's legend. Correct. -We'll tell you a story of Victini and the People of the Vale. Here we go. Have a look. Over a thousand year ago, the People of the Vale proudly lived under the rule of a mighty king. It's Victini. Was it the king's Pokmon? Yes, that's what the legend says. The king ruled over, what was called, the Kingdome of the Vale. -Kingdome of the Vale? The Kingdome drew it's energy from the Dragon Force. What's Dragon Force? -It's the power, that flows invisible through or planet. By using that power wisely, people and Pokmon alike, were able to create an enviroment in perfect harmony. At one with nature. The King had two sons. Twin princes. And both princes were filled with wisdome and courage. Each prince possessed a unique quality, for which they were nicknamed. The hero of ideals and the hero of truth. They were greatly loved. -Are those... -Pokmon? Both princes were accompanied by great Dragon Pokmon. Zekrom and Reshiram. Both of them granted great wisdome and strength, only to those judged worthy. But... ...the country lost it's way and the two princes became enemies. Which eventualy lead to a great and destructive war. The two fought ferociously, finally wounding each other. Which used up all of there life energy. These great Dragon Pokmon were transformed into stone and fell into a long, deep slumber. By the time the two princes realised the mistake, they had made, it was too late. The Dragon Force energy became chaotic. Witnessing the destruction of his people land, the King decided to use the power of Victini. Victini's... -Power. Victini, please. Grant me the use of your power. In order to harness Victini's power, the King created a Barrier around the castle, using the Pillars of Protection. So, with all of the town's people, gathered on top of the castle, it lifted up, into the sky. And the castle was carried to this mountain top. However, the King's power was spent and the Pillars of Protection and the Barrier remained. Eventualy, the chaos within the Dragon Force subsided. The two princes were filled with deep remorse and they moved the stone Dragon Pokmon to a safe and secret location. But, the People of the Vale lost there bond with the land and scattered everywhere. They've been leaving behind Victini, who vanished from sight. -Victini's been here for more then a thousand years? -A thousand years? And trapped inside the Barrier for all that time. Victini... My goal is to bring the Kingdome of the Vale back to life. Back to life? Victini! You said, it would be nice, if the Kingdome of the Vale could be restored. I did. The energy of this land no longer flows here. So neither people nor Pokmon can live. Would it be great if they could? That's my dream, Damon. And now, I can finally fulfill that dream of yours. It look like Victini wasn't so alone, after all. Yeah. Are those for us? Victini, thanks! Thanks, Victini. Merci. Bon apptit! It's yummi! -Yeah, it's delicious! Three years ago Damon returned and played me a visit at my home. I want to contact the People of the Vale, who have scatered everywhere and have them return, so we can rebuild our Kingdome. But that's impossible. -I have to try. Those, who say impossible, accomplished nothing. Since that time, I've journeyed far and wide in search of the People of the Vale. Legend, nothing but legend. Now, get out! At first, no one would even listen to me. Here you go, Damon. It's for you. Thank you, Luisa. Suddenly, I heard a voice. Is that as far, as you will go, for your ideals? What was that? If there so worthless, just abandone them. Again, the voice. I heard it coming from the Sword of the Vale. From the castle? So, we went to the cave, located beneath the castle. We can't go farther, for some reason. Damon? Mannes? -Damon! How did you get down there? -All I know is, that I'm here now! Amazing. The path chooses the one, it allows to pass. -I'll go alone. The path was filled with obstacles. But, somehow, I made it through. The Great Dark Stone. So you're the one, who lead me down here. You have proven your determination, to realise your ideals. I met the Great Zekrome. You met Zekrom? Incredible. Yes, come in! I have found the answer. Zekrom has shown me, how the People of the Vale can you the Sword of the Vale, to gain complete control of the Dragon Force's energy. I'm sorry, Victini. Please, forgive me, for trapping you here. I'm so sorry. Poor Victini. So you are lonely, aren't you? Victini, do you wanna go there? Ok! Victini, I promise, I will take you to the ocean. From this day foward, the People of the Vale, will be reunited with there land. Sigilyph! The Pillars of Protection. -But, what's happening? Victini! It has begun. Up there. -It's Victini. Come on. Let's go after it. Victini! Victini... I ask, that you grant me your power. Damon! -Victini's power is increasing the psychic type Pokmon strength in the castle! Take a look! Ash? -Carlita. Where's Victini? What was that? The castle. James, what's going on? -I think, the castle's moving. It's flyin'! I'm using the castle, to change the flow of the Dragon Force! It's finally happened! We're on our way. The Kingdome of the Vale will be renewed, when the castle is returned. Ash, Victini is lending me it's power. You're hurting Victini. You gotta let it go. I won't, not while I still need it's power. Stop it! Stop or Victini will die! -Damon, please. Stop it now. But, mother... Now, Pikachu. Use Thunderbolt. Pikachu, destroy the Pillars! Electro Ball! Zekrom. -It is? Golurk, stop Zekrom! Golurk! Gothitelle, use Confusion! Stop! Damon! Pikachu, quick! Thunderbolt! Ash, no. The Sword of the Vale must not me moved. If the Sword of the Vale is moved once more, the Dragon Force will be disturbed and that could destroy out entire world. Which means, the castle should never be moved again. Ash! -You're awake! -Thank goodness! Where am I? -In the castle store room. Ash, please, forgive me. -Forgive my brother. He shouldn't have moved the castle! If the castle's moved, the Dragon Force will be disturbed and it will destroy the world! -What did you say? Victini just told me so! The castle was moved to the top of the mountain, to keep the disturbance of the Dragon Force from getting out of control. It can't be. Accordin to legend, the Dragon Force became disturbed after Zekrom turned to stone. Which means, Zekrom doesn't know. So, what do we do? Zekrom's too strong. Reshiram. Reshiram? The other great Dragon Pokmon. -Reshiram has the power to stop Zekrom. -Ok, but, where is Reshiram? Zekrom was beneath the castle, that's where Damon found it. Then that means, Reshiram must ne nearby, as well. Beneath the castle. Ash? What is this? Just how far does this path go? -It feels like, we keep going around in circles. Hold on. Where's Ash? Hey, you guys! Come down here! But, Ash... -How did you get down there? Beats me! We're gonna go on ahead! Go for it! -Find Reshiram! You got it! Victini's in a lot of pain. Do you possess the courage to see the truth? We gotta keep moving! Pikachu, make sure, you stay with me! Pikachu! I'm ok. Where are we? What is your wish? Your truth? My truth... I really wanna help Victini. I've gotta help! Victini lived here all alone for a thousand years. Lonely. Must've been so lonely. I promised, I'd take Victini to the ocean. It is your courage, that shall become your truth. Juanita, look through the clouds! No. It's Mannes. Things look pretty bad down there! The Dragon Force is out of controle! How did you know? Because Ash told us it would happen. Golurk, you must go and stop the castle! Zekrom, don't let it get in my way. Golurk, no! Everyone, get in! Golurk, I know, you can do it! C'mon, you can do it. -Easy for you to say! You've got claws! What's going on? Golurk, get out of there! Too late! It's Ash! -And he found Reshiram! It's Reshiram. Reshiram, fly down and let us off at the castle! Victini! Now, Pikachu! Use Thunderbolt! You did well, Golurk. Pikachu, Quick Attack! Pikachu, hang in there! Sometimes in a search for ideals, sacrifices are required. -My ideals don't need a sacrifice! Thanks, Pikachu. I'm coming, Victini. Zekrom, stop those two! Zekrom, what's wrong? Victini. But why, Zekrom? But why? I can hear the lands anger. Anger? Damon, the Vale is in deep trouble. -The Dragon Force is out of controle. No. Fulfilling my mother's dream... How could that be wrong? Damon, isn't there any way to calm the Dragon Force? Please, Damon. I don't know. I just don't know. You must soothe the anger of the land. Use the Sword. That's it. The Sword of the Vale will once again restrain the Dragon Force. Reshiram, Zekrom, lend me your power. The Dragon Force reversed on itself. Look, Mannes. The castle is starting to crumble. You must get everybody out. -Right, Damon. Everyone, this way! Victini. Ash, quick! Damon! -You go on ahead! Damon, wait. Ash, you gotta get away from here. -But, Damon... Ash, go. I've got to do this alone. Ash, hurry up! It's the Barrier! -No, Ash! Victini, can't get passed. -And the Barrier's closing in. No, Damon! Pikachu, Victini! Stay close to me! It's so cold. Pretty soon, we're gonna run out of air. Gotta think. What can I do? Ash, listen. You'll make it. Damon, it's you. Now, destroy the Pillars of Protection. We've got to release all of the energy. Ash, you can't give up. Because you've been chosen by the great Dragon Pokmon. Me, give up? No way! We're coming. I can't move. My body won't let me. Victini, I'm really sorry. Victini, I know I promised you... ...I'd take you to the ocean. I'm sorry. Victini? What are you... Victini. No, Victini! Victini. Pikachu. Ash, Pikachu! Are you all right? The leading edge of the Dragon Force! I can see it up ahead! Is that, where the castle goes? -Yes, exactly. That's the only way to calm down the chaotic Dragon Force. Damon! You've got one shot at this! We're alive. -And on land. Land is good. Which means... -Together. -Life is great! We're at the ocean, Victini. You gave us every bit of power you had, even so, I didn't give you anything. Ash. Victini, I'm sorry. Victini! You love macaroons! We've got some left! This has a strangely familiar flavour. Sure does. Here's the rest. Guess, I'I just have to eat all of these. And here I go! Victini. Sorry. Are you ok? Of course. I get it. You're gonna head out to the Vale, aren't you, Victini? Go make everyone happy, ok? I still got some macaroons. Damon, what... -Everyone, please, forgive me. Damon... The future's what's importante. Let's restore the land of our ideals.
