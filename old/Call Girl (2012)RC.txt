it So what would that entail state custody Since the school does not want Iris to return probably a foster home Or something else Unfortunately we havent heard from the foster family dont understand Surely things cant just go on like this No The parties concerned believe that it would be best for Iris if she were to be admitted to Alsunda Juvenile Home She would live there full time and take part in their activities It would provide some stability at least shed be among her peers What do you think It can be difficult for them to make these decisions which is why we prefer to give

and open view on sexuality and its manifestation However a radical attitude change has occurred recently The concept of incest is abolished Sexual relations between family members will no longer be

perpetrator has acted with recklessness Wrong room again Aspen Right and so are you Theyre working in there The sex crimes commission Drafting the new bill Oh right You know like the view from up here better If a person has sexual intercourse with a child under years a fine or imprisonment for no more than two years shall be imposed In limited cases no onus of responsibility will be attributed

mostly business men Some are civil servants some are army men real big shot from Prison Services You can watch Pillars of the community Judges prosecutors politicians Ministers Ministers What ministers m not stupid cant answer that If this gets out there is no point in holding an election this year Minister of Justice demands actions against the porn business We made love to Stockholms

to Dagmars girls and he is not the only one What about the other matter What other matter The young girls What young girls One woman said that Glans has underage girls No names but Were not rooting around anymore Why not question the young girls There is no time Time If there are minors involved the charge is child sexual abuse Rescheduling is entirely out of the question and it would be altogether too difficult to find these juvenile home girls How do you know they are juvenile home girls Listen take it up with Wahl m on sickleave holiday Yes dig out the swimming trunks Nygren hear its going to be sunny Sandberg Someone was just in my office Did you see who Hell m gonna miss her so much There is no one like her Damn it Sasja know Your legal representative Srensson is here love you Prosecutor Wahl is taking over from Rundgren is an entirely reasonable sum considering the circumstances of my own money It would be difficult to go lower Small potatoes all things considered It is fair play The charge may be gross procuring and you may well go to prison But Am to be charged defended and sentenced by my own clients Dont be too difficult The procuring charge may be avoided if we sign over the flat leases to the girls Dagmar Glans was convicted today of gross procuring You look worn out have a day with the kids tomorrow ve worked two doubleshifts m spent promoting indecent behaviour by introducing men and women for the purpose of sexual relations Vice prosecutor Wahl is satisfied with the courts verdict But Dagmar Glans will appeal and remains in custody for a time Considering the evidence presented can find no reason for vice prosecutor Wahl to include client statements in the report They are of no importance to the investigation It is now official that the Russian modern pentathlete Onishchenko who was recently disqualified from the Summer Olympics had modified his pe What the hell Greta Wanna destroy the whole bloody lawn Youre an idiot Forget about it

have a lawyer Go sit in the front ll be right behind you call upon the defence My client has decided to retract her appeal The new information about these young girls must be included in the original charge for which Dagmar Glans was convicted We ask for a verdict of not guilty If the court reaches the conclusion that Dagmar Glans is guilty the only suitable punishment has to be a suspended sentence Dagmar Glans is thus given a suspended sentence Be aware that a suspended sentence means probation for two years This trial is now closed Why is everyone leaving National Police Commissioner Folke Widegren Come in You want me to give this to the government just before the election would be decapitated But you are right We cannot act as their plumbers The preliminary investigation of Glans
