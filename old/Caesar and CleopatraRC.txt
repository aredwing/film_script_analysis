suffer The King wished to say that the gods would not suffer the impiety of his sister to go unpunished Yes yes remember the rest of it Therefore the gods sent a stranger one Mark Antony a Roman captain of horsemen across the sands of the desert and he set my father again upon the throne Now And now that my father is dead my sister Cleopatra would snatch the kingdom from me and reign in my place But the gods would not suffer will not maintain Oh yeswill not maintain such iniquity But with the help of the witch Ftatateeta she hath cast a spell on the Roman Julius Caesar to uphold her

Take it and leave us to settle our own affairs Yes return to your own country Egypt belongs to us not to you Egypt for the Egyptians Egypt for the Egyptians Egypt for the Egyptians Do you forget that there is a Roman army of occupation here left by Aulus Gabinius when he set up your toy king for you And now under my command am the Roman general here Caesar And also the Egyptian general eh That is so Caesar So you can make war on the Egyptians in the name of Rome and on the Romanson me if necessaryin the name of Egypt That is so Caesar And which side are you on at present if may presume to ask general On the side of the right and of the gods Hm How many men have you That will appear when take the field Are your men Romans If not it matters not how many there are Insolence It is useless to

to secure the retreat of my own soldiers am accountable for every life among them am the Kings guardian stand on my right here Where is your right It is in the Rufios scabbard my friend may not be able keeping it there much longer And this is Roman justice But not Roman gratitude hope Is Caesars life of so little account to him that he forgets we have saved it My life is that all Your life your laurels your future can call a witness to prove that but for us Roman army of occupation led by Pompey the greatest soldier in the world would now have Caesar at its mercy Ho there Lucius Septimius come forth and testify before Caesar No no Yes say Let the military tribune bear witness Lucius Septimius Bear witness Lucius Septimius Caesar came to Egypt in pursuit of his foe Did we shelter his foe As Pompeys foot touched the Egyptian shore his head fell by the stroke of my sword We have given you a full and sweet measure of vengeance Vengeance Oh if could stoop to vengeance what would not exact from you as the price of this murdered mans blood Was he not my soninlaw my ancient friend Am Julius Caesar or am a wild beast that you fling to me the grey head of the old soldier the laurelled conqueror and then claim my gratitude for it Begone you fill me with horror Pshaw You have seen severed heads before Caesar and severed right hands too think some thousands of them after you vanquished the king of the Gauls Did you spare him with all your clemency Was that vengeance Would that it had been Vengeance at least is human No by the gods those severed right hands and the brave king of Gauls basely strangled in a vault beneath the Capitol were a wise severity a necessary protection to the commonwealth a duty of statesmanship follies and fictions ten times bloodier than honest vengeance What a fool was then To think that mens lives should be at the mercy of such fools Lucius Septimius pardon me why should the slayer of the king of the Gauls rebuke the slayer of Pompey You are free to go All here in this palace Free Achillas army renegades and all Free Rufio Lucius Septimius You are free to go with the rest Or stay if you will will find a place for you in my service The odds are against you Caesar go Farewell Come Pothinus Achillas whilst there is yet time Do you suppose he would let us go if he had our heads in his hands Caesar this is not good sense Your duty to Rome demands that her enemies should be prevented from doing further mischief It is no use talking to him Britannus you may save your breath to cool your porridge But mark this Caesar Clemency is very well for you but what is it for your soldiers who have to fight tomorrow the men you spared yesterday You may give what orders you please but for one will take no prisoners will kill my enemies in the field shall never have to fight them again And now with your leave will see these gentry off the premises What Have they left the boy alone Oh shame shame Come your majesty Is he Is he turning me out of my palace You are welcome to stay if you wish Go my boy will not harm you but you will be safer away among your friends Here you are in the lions mouth It is not the lion fear but the jackal Brave boy Little silly You think that very clever Britannus Attend the King Give him in charge to that Pothinus fellow And this piece of goods What is to be done with However suppose may leave that to you Did you mean me to go with the rest You are free to do just as you please Cleopatra Then you do not care whether stay or not Of course had rather you stayed Much rather Much much

their shapes as they please Everything about him is magical He would not sleep in a golden chamber permitted soldiers bring a bare stretcher from the cabin put it in his study Even then he did not sleep in it and sat up working like a slave all night Everyone obeys him as if he were a god think he is a god in disguise for hes changed your nature as not Yes he has this is truth Ftatatita before

your honorthe honor of Rome do not make human sacrifices to my honor as your Druids do Since you will not burn these at least can drown them Caesar this is mere eccentricity Are traitors to be allowed to go free for the sake of a paradox Caesar when the islander has finished preaching call me again Caesar my great master if could but persuade you to regard life seriously as men do in my country Do they truly do so Britannus Have you not been there Have you not seen them What Briton speaks as you do in your moments of levity What Briton neglects to attend the services at the sacred grove What Briton wears clothes of many colors as you do instead of plain blue as all solid well esteemed men should These are moral questions with us Well well my friend some day shall settle down and have a blue toga perhaps Meanwhile must get on as best can in my flippant Roman way What now Hail What is this Who are you How did you come here Calm yourself my friend am not going to eat you Hail great

back to the Queen and tell her that if all goes well we shall return to the palace this evening Caesar cannot return As approached the lighthouse some fool threw a great leathern bag into the sea It broke the nose of my boat and had hardly time to get myself and my charge to the shore before the poor little cockleshell sank am sorry Apollodorus The fool shall be rebuked Well well what have you brought me The Queen will be hurt if do not look at it Caesar have we time to waste on this trumpery The Queen is only a child Just so that is why we must not disappoint her Caesar it is a Persian

crane then The crane Caesar have sworn to tender this bale of carpet as tender my own life Then let them swing you up at the same time and if the chain breaks you and the pigeons eggs will perish

elderly Tyrian and his son Well conducted youth of What An old man and boy work that Twenty men you mean No no two only assure you They have counterweights and a machine with boiling water in it which do not understand it is not of British design Leave the crane to me Go and await the descent of the chain Good You will see me presently there rising like the sun with my treasure Are you really going to wait here for this foolery Caesar Why not The Egyptians will let you know why not if they have the sense to make a rush before our barricade is finished And here we are waiting like children to see a carpet full of pigeons eggs Fear not my son Rufio When the first Egyptian takes his first step along the mole the alarm will sound and we two will reach the barricade before the Egyptians we two Rufio the old man and you his biggest boy And the old man will be there first So peace and give me some more dates Haul away Easy there Further round So Haul up Gently slowly slowlymind the eggs Slowly slowly Haul away Stand off my friends let Caesar see Nothing but a heap of shawls Where are the pigeons eggs Approach Caesar and search for them among the shawls Ha treachery Keep back Caesar

seems to breathe very regularly This is a pretty little snake Let us have the rest of you Oh m smothered Oh Caesar a man stood on me in the boat and a great sack of something fell upon me out of the sky and then the boat sank and then was swung up into the air and bumped down Well never mind here you are safe and sound at last Ay and now that she is here what are we to do with her Caesar it is not proper She cannot stay here without the companionship of some matron Horrible Arent you glad to see me Yes am very glad But Rufio is very angry and Britannus is shocked You can have their heads cut off cant you They would not be so useful with their heads cut off as they are now my sea bird We shall have to go away presently and cut some of your Egyptians heads How will you like being left here with the chance of being captured by that little brother of yours if we are beaten But you mustnt leave me alone Caesar you will not leave me alone will you What Not when the trumpet sounds and all our lives depend on Caesars being at the barricade before the Egyptians reach it Eh Let them lose their lives they are only soldiers Cleopatra when that trumpet sounds we must take every man his life in his hand and throw it in the face of Death And of my soldiers who have trusted me there is not one whose hand shall not hold more sacred than your head Apollodorus you must take her back to the palace Am a dolphin Caesar to cross the seas with young ladies on my back My boat is sunk all yours are either at the barricade or have returned to the city It does not matter will not go back Nobody cares for me Cleopatra You want me to be killed My poor child your life matters little here to anyone but yourself Come Rufio Do not leave me Caesar Caesar we are cut off The Egyptians have landed from the west harbor between us and the barricade Rufio my men at the barricade are lost have murdered them Ay that comes of fooling with this girl here Caesar Caesar the egyptians We must defend ourselves here have thrown the ladder into the sea They cannot get in without it Ay and we cannot get out Have you thought of that Not get out Why not You have ships in the east harbor The galleys are standing in towards us already And by what road are we to walk to the galleys pray By the road that leads everywhere the diamond path of the sun and moon How far off is the nearest galley Fifty fathom No no Nearly quarter of a mile Apollodorus Good Defend yourselves here until send you a boat from that galley Have you wings perhaps Water wings soldier Behold Bravo Apollodorus bravo By Jupiter will do that too Britannus You are mad You shall not Why not Can not swim as well as he Can an old fool dive and swim like a young one Old Rufio you forget yourself will race you to the galley for a weeks pay father Rufio But me Me Me What is to become of me will carry you on my back to the galley like a dolphin Rufio when you see me rise to the surface throw her in No no shall be drowned And then in with you after her both of you Caesar am a man and a Briton not a fish must have a boat cannot swim Neither can Stay here then Britannus until recapture the lighthouse will not forget you Now Rufio You have made up your mind to this folly The Egyptians have made it up for me And mind where you jump do not want to get you in the small of my back One last word Caesar Do not let yourself be seen in the fashionable part of Alexandria until you have changed your clothes Ho Apollodorus The white upon the blue above Is purple on the green below Oh let me see He will be drowned Ahahahah He has got her Hold the fort Briton Caesar will not forget you Another royal banquet in Caesars honour These Romans are magicians For six months a mere handful of them held the palace against all Egypts army forces And look at their escape from the Pharos Who but a magician could swim like a dolphin at Caesars age carrying a queen on his back May be its the Queens magic She rides on Caesars back on land now as on the sea You laugh take care take care will find out some day how to make myself served as Caesar is served Old hooknose Silence Do you know why allow you all to chatter impertinently just as you please instead of treating you as Ftatateeta would treat you if she were Queen Because you try to imitate Caesar in everything and he lets everybody say what they please to him No but because asked him one day why he did so and he said Let your women talk and you will learn something from them What have to learn from them said What they said he and oh you should have seen his eye as he said it You would have curled up you shallow things At whom are you laughing at me or at Caesar At Caesar If you were not a fool you would laugh at me and if you were not a coward you would not be afraid to tell me so Heigho wish Caesar were back in Rome It will be a bad day for you all when he goes Oh if were not ashamed to let him see that am as cruel at heart as my father would make you repent that speech Why do you wish him away He makes you so terribly prosy and serious and learned and philosophical It is worse than being religious at ages Cease that endless cackling will you Hold your tongues Well well we must try to live up to Caesar Pothinus craves the ear of the Queen suppose he has bribed you to admit him to me Now by my fathers gods Have not told you not to deny things All you sell audiences to the Queen as if saw whom you please and not whom please Go take the bribe and bring me Pothinus But Dont answer me Go want to learn to play the harp with my own hands Caesar loves music Can you teach me Assuredly and no one else can teach the Queen All the other teachers are quacks have exposed them repeatedly Good you shall teach me How long will it take Not very long only four years Your Majesty must first become proficient in the philosophy of Pythagoras Has she become proficient in the philosophy of Pythagoras Oh she is but a slave She learns as a dog learns Well then will learn as a dog learns for she plays better than you You shall give me a lesson every day for a fortnight After that whenever strike a false note you shall be flogged and if strike so many that there is not time to flog you you shall be thrown into the Nile to feed the crocodiles Give the girl a gold piece and send them away But true art cannot be thus forced What is this Answering the Queen forsooth Out with you Well Pothinus what is the latest news from your rebel friends am no friend of rebellion And a prisoner does not receive news You are no more a prisoner than amthan Caesar is These six months we have been besieged in this palace by my subjects You are allowed to walk on the beach among the soldiers Can go further myself or can Caesar You are but a child Cleopatra and do not understand these matters see you do not know the latest news Pothinus What is that That Cleopatra is no longer a child Shall tell you how to grow much older and much wiser in one day should prefer to grow wiser without growing older Well go up to the top of the lighthouse and get somebody to take you by the hair and throw you into the sea She is right Pothinus you will come to the shore with much conceit washed out of you Begone all of you will speak with Pothinus alone What are waiting for It is not meet that the Queen remain alone with Must sacrifice you to your fathers gods Ftatateeta to teach you that am Queen of Egypt and not you You are like the rest of them You want to be what these Romans call a New Woman Now Pothinus why did you bribe Ftatateeta to bring you hither Cleopatra what they tell me is true You are changed Do you speak with Caesar every day for six months and will be changed It is the common talk that you are infatuated with this old man Infatuated What does that mean Made foolish is it not Oh no wish were You wish you were made foolish How so When was foolish did what liked Now that Caesar has made me wise it is no use my liking or disliking do what must be done and have no time to attend to myself That is not happiness but it is greatness think If Caesar were gone could govern the Egyptians Cleopatra this may be the vanity of youth No no it is not that am so clever but that the others are so stupid Truly that is the great secret Now tell me what you came to say Nothing Nothing At leastto beg for my liberty that is all For that you would have knelt to Caesar No Pothinus you came with some plan that depended on Cleopatra being a little nursery kitten Now that Cleopatra is a Queen the plan is upset Is Cleopatra then indeed a Queen and no longer Caesars prisoner and slave Pothinus we are all Caesars slaves all we in this land of Egypt whether we will or no And she who is wise enough to know this will reign when Caesar departs You harp on Caesars departure What if do Does he not love you Love me Pothinus Caesar loves no one He makes friends with everyone as he does with dogs and children His kindness to me is a wonder neither mother father nor nurse have ever taken so much care for me or thrown open their thoughts to me so freely But how can you be sure that he does not love you as men love women Because cannot make him jealous have tried Hm Perhaps should have asked then do you love him Can one love a god Besides love another Roman no god but a manone who can love and hate one whom can hurt and who would hurt me Does Caesar know this Yes And he is not angry He promises to send him to Egypt to please me do not understand this man understand Caesar How could you doby instinct Your Majesty caused me to be admitted today What message has the Queen for me This You think that by making my brother king you will rule in Egypt because you are his guardian and he is a little silly The Queen is pleased to say so The Queen is pleased to say this also That Caesar will eat up you and Achillas and my brother as a cat eats up mice and that he will put on this land of Egypt as a shepherd puts on his garment And when he has done that he will return to Rome and leave Cleopatra here as his viceroy That he shall never do We have a thousand men to his ten and we will drive him and his beggarly legions into the sea You rant like any common fellow Cleopatra Enough Ftatateeta Caesar has spoiled me for talking to weak things like you know to whom must go now Let me go forth from this hateful place What angers you The curse of all the gods of Egypt be upon her She has sold her country to the Roman that she may buy it back from him with her kisses Fool did she not tell you that she would have Caesar gone You listened took care that some honest woman should be at hand whilst you were with her And mark this mistress You thought before Caesar came that Egypt should presently be ruled by you and your crew in the name of Cleopatra set myself against it Ay that it might be ruled by you and crew in the name of Ptolemy Better me or even you than a woman with a Roman heart and that is what Cleopatra is now become Whilst live she shall never rule So guide yourself accordingly Wait here Here your excellency The Roman commander will await Caesar here That was a climb How high have we come We are on the palace roof Beloved of Victory Good the Beloved of Victory has no more stairs to get up Caesar approaches Why Rufio new baldrick new golden pommel to your sword And you have had your hair cut But not your beard Impossible Yes perfumed by Jupiter Olympus Well is it to please myself No Rufio my son but to please me to celebrate my birthday Your birthday You always have a birthday when there is a pretty girl to be flattered or an ambassador to be conciliated Rufio We had seven of them in ten months last year It is true Rufio shall never break myself of these petty deceits Have you noticed that am before my time Aha thought that meant something What is it Pothinus wants to speak to you advise you to see him there is some plotting going on here among the women Who is Pothinus Oh yes And has he not escaped No Why not Have not told you always to let prisoners escape unless there are special orders to the contrary Are there not enough mouths to be fed without his Yes and if you would have a little sense and let me cut his throat you would save his rations Anyhow he escape He prefers to stay and spy on us And you want me to see him dont want anything daresay you will do what you like Dont put it on to me Well well let us have him in Ho there guard Release your man and send him up Who is to dine with us besides Cleopatra Apollodorus the Sicilian That popinjay Come the popinjay is an amusing dog tells a story sings a song and saves us the trouble of flattering the Queen Well he can swim a bit and fence a bit he might be worse if he only knew how to hold his tongue The gods forbid he should ever learn Ah Pothinus You are welcome And what is the news this afternoon Caesar come to warn you of a danger and to make you an offer Never mind the danger Make the offer Never mind the offer Whats the danger Caesar you think that Cleopatra is devoted to you My friend already know what think Come to your offer will deal plainly know not by what magic you have been enabled to defend the palace and a few yards of beach against a city and an army But we know now that your gods are irresistible and that you are a worker of miracles no longer threaten you Very handsome of you indeed So be it you are the master Yes yes my friend But what then Spit it out man What have you to say have to say that you have a traitress in your camp Cleopatra The Queen You should have spat it out sooner you fool Now it is too late What is doing here Just going to tell me something about you You shall hear it Proceed Pothinus Caesar Well out with it What have to say is for your ear not for the Queens There are means of making you speak Take care Caesar does not employ those means My dear when a man has anything to tell in this world the difficulty is not to make him tell it but to prevent him from telling it too often Let me celebrate my birthday by setting you free Farewell well not meet again Caesar this mercy is foolish Will you not give me a private audience Your life may depend on it Ho there guard Pass the prisoner out He is released Now off with you You have lost your chance speak You see Torture would not have wrung a word from him Caesar you have taught Cleopatra the arts by which Romans govern the world Alas They cannot even govern themselves What then What then Are you so besotted with her beauty that you do not see that she is impatient to reign in Egypt alone and that her heart is set on your departure Liar What Protestations Contradictions No do not deign to contradict Let him talk From her own lips have heard it You are to be her catspaw you are to tear the crown from her brothers head and set it on her own delivering us all into her hand delivering yourself also And then Caesar can return to Rome or depart through the gate of death which is nearer and surer Well and is not this very natural Natural Then you do not resent treachery Resent thou foolish Egyptian what have to do with resentment Do resent the wind when it chills me or the night when it makes me stumble in the darkness To tell me such a story as this is but to tell me that the sun will rise tomorrow But it is falsefalse swear it It is true though you swore it a thousand times and believed all you swore Come Rufio let us see Pothinus past the guard have a word to say to him We must give the Queen a moment to recover herself Tell your friends Pothinus that they must not think am opposed to a reasonable settlement of the countrys affairs Ftatateeta Ftatateeta Peace child be comforted Can they hear us No dear heart no If he leaves the Palace alive never see my face again He Pothinus Strike his life out as strike his name from your lips Dash him down from the wall Break him on the stones Kill kill him The dog shall perish Fail in this and you go out from before me forever So be it You shall not see my face until his eyes are darkened Soonsoon When the light dies he shall die So you have come back to me Caesar thought you were angry Welcome Apollodorus Cleopatra grows more womanly beautiful from week to week Truth Apollodorus Far far short of the truth Friend Rufio threw a pearl into the sea Caesar fished up a diamond Caesar fished up a touch of rheumatism Come on Come to dinner To dinner have ordered a dinner for you Caesar Ay What are we to have Peacocks brains Peacocks brains Apollodorus Not for me prefer nightingales tongues Roast boar Rufio Good What has become of my leathern cushion have got new ones for you These cushions Caesar are of Maltese gauze stuffed with rose leaves Rose leaves Am a caterpillar What a shame My new cushions What shall we serve to whet Caesars appetite Any oysters Assuredly oysters British oysters of course Oysters then Sea hedgehogs for me Is there nothing solid to begin with Fieldfares with asparagus Fattened fowls Have some fattened fowls Rufio Ay that will do Fieldfares for me Caesar will deign to choose his wine Sicilian Toscan Macedonian Chianti All Greek Try the Sicilian Caesar Bring me my barley water Ugh Bring my Falernian It is waste of time giving you dinners Caesar My scullions would not condescend to your diet Well well let us try the Falernian But when return to Rome will make laws against these extravagances will even get the laws carried out Never mind Today you are to be like other people idle luxurious and kind Well for once will sacrifice my comfort there Now are you satisfied And you no longer believe that long for your departure for Rome no longer believe anything My brains are asleep Besides who knows whether shall return to Rome How Eh What One year of Rome is like another except that grow older It is no better here in Egypt The old men when they are tired of life say We have seen everything except the source of the Nile And why not see that Cleopatrawill you come with me and track the flood to its cradle in the heart of the regions of mystery Shall make you a new kingdom and build you a holy city there in the great unknown Yes Yes You shall Ay now he will conquer Africa with two legions before finished the roast boar Come no scoffing this is a noble scheme Let us name the holy city and consecrate it with Sicilian Wine and Cleopatra shall name it herself It shall be called Caesars Gift to his Beloved No no Something vaster than that something universal like the starry firmament Why not simply The Cradle of the Nile No the Nile is my ancestor and he is a god Oh have thought of something The Nile shall name it himself Let us call upon him all together Send for him And away with all of you Go am a priestess and have power to take your charge from you What hocuspocus is this It is hocuspocus To do it properly we should kill something to please him but perhaps he will answer Caesar without that if we spill some wine to him Why not appeal to our hawkheaded friend here Sh He will hear you and be angry The source of the Nile is out of his district expect Now let us call on the Nile all together You must say with me Send us thy voice Father Nile Send us thy voice Father Nile What was that Nothing They are beating some slave Nothing man with a knife in him ll swear murder sh Silence Did you hear that Another cry No a thud Something fell on the beach think Something with bones in it eh Rufio Will you leave me Caesar Apollodorus are you going Faith dearest Queen my appetite is gone Apollodorus go down to the courtyard and find out what has happened Your soldiers have killed somebody perhaps What does it matter This must be seen to Is she drunk Not with wine The Queen looks again on the face of her servant There is some mischief between those two Cleopatra what has happened Nothing dearest Caesar Nothing am innocent Dear Caesar are you angry with me Why do you look at me so have been here with you all the time How can know what has happened That is true Of course it is true You know it is true Rufio shall know presently Caesar remember bodyguard is within call Why do you allow Rufio to speak to me so You should teach him his place Teach him to be my enemy and to hide his thoughts from me as you are now hiding yours Why do you say that Caesar Indeed indeed am not hiding anything You are wrong to treat me like this am only a child and you turn into stone because you think someone has been killed cannot bear it But there know you hate tears you shall not be troubled with them Only am so silly cannot help being hurt when you speak coldly Of course you are quite right it is dreadful to think of anyone being killed or even hurt and hope nothing really serious has What has frightened you into this What have you done Aha That sounds like the answer have not betrayed you Caesar swear it know that have not trusted you The town has gone mad think They are for tearing the palace down and driving us into the sea straight away We laid hold of this renegade in clearing them out of the courtyard Release him What has offended the citizens Lucius Septimius What did you expect Caesar Pothinus was a favorite of theirs What has happened to Pothinus set him free here not half an hour ago Did they not pass him out Ay through the gallery arch sixty feet above ground with three inches of steel in his ribs He is as dead as Pompey We are quits now as to killingyou and Assassinated our prisoner our guest Rufio Whoever did it was a wise man and a friend of yours but none of had a hand in it So it is no use to frown at me He was slain by order of the Queen of Egypt am not Julius Caesar the dreamer who allows every slave to insult him Rufio has said did well now the others shall judge me too This Pothinus sought to make me conspire with him to betray Caesar refused and he cursed me and came privily to Caesar to accuse me of his own treachery he insulted me the Queen To my face Caesar would not revenge me he spoke him fair and set him free Was right to avenge myself Speak Lucius do not gainsay it But you will get little thanks for it from Caesar Apollodorus speak Was wrong have only one word of blame most beautiful You should have called upon me your knight and in fair duel should have slain the slanderer will be judged by your very slave Caesar Britannus speak Was wrong Were treachery falsehood and disloyalty left unpunished society must become like an arena full of wild beasts tearing one another to pieces Caesar is in the wrong And so the verdict is against me it seems Listen to me Caesar If one man in all Alexandria can be found to say that did wrong swear to have myself crucified on the door of the palace by my own slaves If one man in all the world can be found now or forever to know that you did wrong that man will have either to conquer the world as have or be crucified by it Do you hear These knockers at your gate are also believers in vengeance and in stabbing You have slain their leader it is right that they shall slay you And so to the end of history murder shall breed murder always in the name of right and honor and peace until the gods are tired of blood and create a race that can understand Let the Queen of Egypt now give her orders for vengeance and take her measures for defense for she has renounced Caesar You will not desert me Caesar You will defend the palace You have taken the powers of life and death upon you am only a dreamer But they will kill me And why not In pity Pity What Has it come to this so suddenly that nothing can save you now but pity Did it save Pothinus Caesar enough of preaching The enemy is at the gate Ay and what has held him baffled at the gate all these months Was it my folly as you deem it or your wisdom In this Egyptian Red Sea of blood whose hand has held all your heads above the waves And yet When Caesar says to such an one Friend go free you clinging for your little life to my sword dare steal out and stab him in the back By the gods am tempted to open my hand and let you all sink into the flood Will you desert us because we are a parcel of fools mean no harm by killing do it as a dog kills a cat by instinct We are all dogs at your heels but we have served you faithfully Alas Rufio my son as dogs we are like to perish now in the streets Caesar what you say has an Olympian ring in it But am still on the side of Cleopatra If we must die she shall not want the devotion of a mans heart nor the strength of a mans arm But dont want to die Oh ignoble ignoble Hearken to me Caesar It may be ignoble but too mean to live as long as can Well my friend you are likely to outlive Caesar Does Caesar despair He who has never hoped can never despair Caesar in good or bad fortune looks his fate in the face Look it in the face now and it will smile as it always has on Caesar Do you presume to encourage me offer you my services will change sides if you will have me What At this point At this point Do you suppose Caesar is mad to trust you do not ask him to trust me until he is victorious ask for my life and for a command in Caesars army And since Caesar is a fair dealer will pay in advance Pay How With a piece of good news for you What news What news What news did you say my son Rufio The relief has arrived Mithridates of Pergamos is on the march Is it not so Lucius Septimius He has taken Pelusium Lucius Septimius you are henceforth my officer Rufio the Egyptians must have sent every soldier from the city to prevent Mithridates crossing the Nile There is nothing in the streets now but mobmob It is so Mithridates is marching by the great road to Memphis to cross above the Delta Achillas will fight him there Achillas shall fight Caesar there See Rufio Here is the palace here is the theatre You take twenty men and pretend to go by street and whilst they are stoning you out go the cohorts by this and this My streets are right are they Lucius Ay that is the fig market saw them the day we arrived Away Britannus tell Petronius that within an hour half our forces must take ship for the western lake See to my horse and armor With the rest shall march round the lake and up the Nile and take Achillas at the desert Lucius give the word to start Apollodorus lend me your sword and your right arm for this campaign Ay my heart and life to boot accept both Are you ready Ready for art the art of war Come this is something like business Is it not my only son You understand about the streets Rufio Ay think do will get through them at all events Caesar Caesar Have you forgotten me Oh am busy now my child busy When return your affairs shall be settled Farewell and be good and patient That game is played and lost Cleopatra The woman always gets the worst of it Go Follow your master word first Tell your executioner that if Pothinus had been properly killed he would not have called out Your man bungled his work How do you know it was a man It was not you you were with us when it happened Was it she With her own hand Whoever it was let my enemies beware of her Look to it Rufio you who dare make the Queen of Egypt a fool before Caesar will look to it Cleopatra Hail Caesar Let us teach the egyptians how to fight and how to run And then home to Rome Hail Caesar Ftatateeta Ftatateeta It is dark and am alone Come to me Ftatateeta The Queen looks again on the face of her servant am he of whose genius you are a symbol part brute part woman and part god Hail Caesar Here he comes Hail Caesar see my ship awaits me The hour for Caesar farewell to Egypt has arrived Now Rufio what remains to be done before go You have not yet appointed a Roman governor for this province What say you to Mithridates of Pergamos Why that you will want him elsewhere Indeed Well what say you to yourself a governor What are you dreaming of Do you not know that am only the son of a freedman Has not Caesar called you his son Peace awhile there and hear me Hear Caesar Hear the service quality rank and name of the Roman governor By service Caesars shield by quality Caesars friend by rank a Roman soldier Hail Caesar By name Rufio Hail Caesar Hail Caesar Ay am Caesars shield but of what use shall be when am no longer on Caesars arm Where is that British Islander of mine Here Caesar Who bade you pray thrust yourself into the battle of the Delta uttering the barbarous cries of your native land Caesar ask you to excuse the language that escaped me in the heat of the moment And how did you who cannot swim cross the canal with us when we stormed the camp Caesar clung to the tail of your horse These are not the deeds of a slave Britannus but of a free man Caesar was born free But they call you Caesars slave Only as Caesars slave have found real freedom Well said Ungrateful that am was about to set you free but now will not part from you for a million talents This Roman knows how to make men serve him Apollodorus leave the art of Egypt in your charge Remember Rome loves art and will encourage it understand Caesar Egypt must pay a tribute to Rome in art And now what else have to do before embark There is something cannot remember wonder what would can it be Well well it must remain undone we must not waste this favorable wind Caesar am loath to let you go to Rome without your shield There are too many daggers there It matters not have always disliked the idea of dying had rather be killed Farewell Rufio Farewell Farewell Apollodorus The Queen Ah there was something How could you let me forget her Rufio Has Cleopatra no part in this leave taking Had gone without seeing you should never have forgiven myself Is this mourning for me Ah that was thoughtless of me It is for your brother No For whom then Ask the Roman governor whom you have left us Rufio Yes Rufio He who is to rule here in Caesars name in Caesars way according to Caesars boasted laws of life He is to rule as he can Cleopatra He has taken the work upon him and will do it in his own way Not in your way then Without punishment Without revenge Without judgment Ay that is the right way the great way the only possible way in the end Believe it Rufio if you can believe it Caesar But look you Cleopatra had a tigress that killed men at her bidding thought she might bid it kill you some day So without malice only cut its throat And that is why Cleopatra comes to you in mourning He has shed the blood of my servant Ftatateeta On your head be it Caesar as upon his if you hold him free of it On my head be it then for it was well done Rufio Come do not be angry with me am sorry for that poor Totateeta Aha You are laughing Does that mean reconciliation No no But it is so ridiculous to hear you call her Totateeta What As much a child as ever Cleopatra Have not made a woman of you after all Oh it is you who are a great baby you make me seem silly because you will not behave seriously But you have treated me badly and do not forgive you Bid me farewell will not will send you a beautiful present from Rome Beauty from Rome to Egypt indeed What can Rome give that Egypt cannot give me That is true Caesar If the present is to be really beautiful shall have to buy it for you in Alexandria You are forgetting the treasures for which Rome is most famous my friend You cannot buy in Alexandria What are they Caesar Her sons Come Cleopatra forgive me and bid me farewell and will send you a man not old and ripe for the knife not hiding a bald head under his conquerors laurels not stooped with the weight of the world on his shoulders but brisk and fresh strong and young hoping in the morning fighting in the day and reveling in the evening Will you take such an one in exchange for Caesar His name his name Shall it be Mark Antony You are a bad hand at a bargain mistress if you will swap Caesar for Antony So now you are satisfied You will not forget will not forget Farewell do not think we shall meet again Hail and farewell Hail Caesar and farewell Hail Caesar and farewell No tears dearest Queen they stab your servant to the heart He will return some day hope not But cant help crying all the same Assembled from a free publication of the play by hear were used to help with
