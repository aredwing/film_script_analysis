Kids these day are always late for school While we leave for school before sunrise have warmed up some food Its on the table Anybody upstairs Yes a lady came here last night Shes about years old What does she do didnt get that much detail from her She seemed to be working nearby have to go How much Baht To prevent decompose we inject the cadaver with Formalin Phenol or carbolic acid During autopsy these compositions prevents the cadaver from decomposing Inject the mixture into the legs aorta then soak the cadaver into the Formalin This will harden both the cells and cadaver we can do autopsy after to months Who would donate a cadaver for experiment Never mind Think about it Ok lets continue from here This is different parts of the humans bones And this forms the shape of a human This is the brain which we have discussed This is the skull its the command centre of all nervous systems Class dont forget donating cadaver for scientific experiment benefits both the donor and researcher In medical science we believe in donating body to someone you dont know is an act of charity and saving lives Its the greatest sacrifice we can do We believed in every cadaver before death would do their best to do a good deed without in the least expecting repayment or any rewards in return Its just for the sake of sacrificing Mai think about it in another way Are you still afraid Students learn this every year and every year theres students possessed They have never told you before Thep Shut Up You will understand Worst Was the nightmare had this morning Everyone please look at the notice board To see which group youre in which cadaver has been assigned to you which work desk youre given to Mai were at work desk The smell of Formalin is a little strong If you cant take it go to your work desk and put on your mask This is a females cadaver Her name is Dawan When performing autopsy Two students of each team will do dissection The other two will refer to the text book to appraise each organ The bigger group students at combined desk will research on different sexes cadaver You will take turn to examine the cadavers to know their difference youll learn more This is Professor Prakit Hes in charge of this curriculum and share his knowledge with you Professor Prakit and will take turn This is his last semester with us Hell be consultant of Kongdon Institute next year Today youll learn the basic of autopsy Were not going to dissect the cadaver yet Instead all of you will take time to get used to the environment and the cadaver Ok try touching the cadaver with your hand Come on try it Come touch it What are you doing Cover the cadaver if youre afraid Mai Why did you uncover the face Were not allowed to do that Oh youre awake You have fainted in the lab Professor felt that youre pale and wants you to rest for a while Are you feeling any better Just now While was in the lab This is your first contact with a cadaver This happens every year youll get used Your friend wants to see you But have asked them to go home Come have some water Stay here and rest for a while m going to get something If youre not well shall send you home What happened Mai what happened think should send you home No No need Hello Hello Jen am Mai Mai Are you alright Professor had dismissed us earlier He told us he will send you home felt like When was looking at the cadaver felt the presence of the ghost The cadavers soul dont know Its probably d uncover her face without her permission Its just your imagination The rest of them had not seen it Are you unwell You have fainted just now Mai m busy with something m hanging up now ll call you tonight Ok My nephew is unwell His father called me and wants me to take care of him for a few days shall leave this place under your care The new tenant is called Noi Please keep the house clean Noi leaves for work vey early and return home late She has no time for house chores So please settle all these when were not in Whos there Noi is that you Mai Mai called you last night but no one answered must have fallen asleep Is there anything wrong Are you still upset over yesterday Theres nothing wrong just felt a little weird Whats so weird Hey Mai are you feeling better Last night smelled like Formalin Yes here too While was about to sleep But we will get used to it hope so By the way last night watched a show about ghost One was related to cadaver Impossible When one died Their hands tight up to let the soul leave But for those who donated the cadaver was not tight up as theyre trapped here The soul is trapped That means That means the soul of the cadaver has never leaves the body Stop your nonsense Thep What Its true No its not true Everyone of them has donated the cadaver for our research And we have not done anything wrong So why would they want to hurt us Enough change a topic Its kind of scary isnt it Change topic We can see from this brain scan On the vey of top of this part This top part is called the cerebrum Jen If we dissect the head well see its powder What Sawdust see that In the fold is called the sulcus This is the lateral surface of the brain This is formed by the upper Cerebrum and the lower part of Cerebrum Cerebrum is divided into parts The right and the left part This is the forebrain structure with the under surface of Cerebrum formed the Occipital This is the visual processing center This small part of the lower surface is the Cerebellum It coordinates movement by sending nerve transmissions down motor nerve outputs Theres two group of nerves in the brain We shall rest for minutes Well begin dissection this afternoon Mai anything wrong Has anything happened again Its probably your imagination Jen is that real Yesterday When fainted in the lab at the clinic and just now Mai calm down If you had really seen a ghost this might help Probably we should stop here today No m ok If you cant take it anymore let me know Ok Everyone check the apparatus in front of you These apparatus is for us to do dissection Theres many apparatus here but the main ones are scalpel forceps and probe These are the apparatus we used to research the nervous systems and the scalpels razor blade Thesere vey sharp blades so be careful Get familiar with the apparatus Lets begin the dissection and research part by part Well start from the thoracic cavity lung and the heart We check the stomach from here It plays an important role in digestion Gastric Intestines Next we look at the arms muscle Legs muscle and the reproductive system As for the brain well leave to the last We shall go through page by page Ok everyone slowly pull aside the cover expose only the chest Firstly we should understand the most outer organs of a human skin Skin is the largest organs It protects out internal organs Mai answer this Besides the emotions transmissions to our brain and body what else gives us life Soul Mai listen Tell me From all you have learnt Wheres the position of the soul Look Its in the brain Soul is located here How about here Or on the top of the head But professor Is there a text book about that That writes wheres the soul located Has any professor taught you that had really seen those things dont think youre ready to be a doctor Umm doctor Can say something Mai Were all professionals We know what the people out there believe in Those simple beliefs are all the same What matters most is youre here now Were doctors Were scientists Similarly if we want to come into here we must leave this beliefs out there We should only believe in things that is reality in life shall try Cadaver is only a shell all the cells are dead all the nerves has stopped working just regard the cadaver in front of you as an organism provided by the nature for your experiment Ok understand now You have to calm yourself down and accept these things Even the slightest fear you have shown you will affect those of your age to be afraid In the past there are some students who cant pass this curriculum The university has to ask them to major in other subjects Mai dont want this to happen to you ve seen her profile Shes the perfect student Shes vey hardworking with vey good results Some students need more time than others to get used to these curriculum Can initiate to tell the committee to let me take care of this student for now Dont worry Mai This happens almost every year The situation will

and look for Prof Prakit Prof Prakit was worried the truth being known and decided to donate the cadaver But it wasnt intentionally And that has provoked the souls Any solutions Only one Move the
